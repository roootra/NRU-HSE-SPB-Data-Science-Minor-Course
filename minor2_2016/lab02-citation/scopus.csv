The overarching theme and goal of the program are to train the next-generation scientists in the tools and techniques of cyber-enabled science (e-Science) to prepare them to confront the emerging petascale challenges of data-intensive science. The Mason CDS program has a significantly stronger focus on data-oriented approaches to science than do most computational science and engineering programs. The program has been designed specifically to focus both on simulation (Computational Science) and on data-intensive applications (Data Science). New courses include Introduction to Computational & Data Sciences, Scientific Data and Databases, Scientific Data & Information Visualization, Scientific Data Mining, and Scientific Modeling & Simulation. This is an interdisciplinary science program, drawing examples, classroom materials, and student activities from a broad range of physical and biological sciences. We will describe some of the motivations and early results from the program.

A universal public domain for scientific data and information will be transformative for both science and society. Over the last several years, two ad-hoc ICSU committees, the Strategic Committee on Information and Data (SCID) and the Strategic Coordinating Committee on Information and Data (SCCID), produced key reports that make 5 and 14 recommendations respectively aimed at improving universal and equitable access to data and information for science and providing direction for key international scientific bodies, such as the Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA) as well as a newly ratified (by ICSU in 2008) formation of the World Data System. This contribution outlines the framing context for both committees based on the changed world scene for scientific data conduct in the 21st century. We include details on the relevant recommendations and important consequences for the worldwide community of data providers and consumers, ultimately leading to a conclusion, and avenues for advancement that must be carried to the many thousands of data scientists world-wide.","Data access; Data management; Data release; Data science; Interdisciplinary science","Committee on data for science and technologies; Data access; Data and information; Data release; Data science; Data systems; Equitable access; High quality; Interdisciplinary science; International science; Public domains; Scientific data; Computer applications; Computer science; Information management",,,,,,"(2008) Priority Initiative ""Digital Information"", , http://www.dfg.de/download/pdf/foerderung/programme/lis/ allianz_initiative_digital_information_en.pdf, Retrieved February 2012 from, WWW; Bell, G., Hey, T., Szalay, A., Beyond the data deluge (2009) Science, 323, pp. 1297-1298. , 6 March 2009; (2011) DataCite, , http//:www.datacite.org, Retreived from the WWW, November 21, 2012; (2010) Riding the Wave.

Data science implies a focus involving data and the systematic study of the organization, properties, and analysis of data and its role in inference, including confidence in the inference. Data science is different from statistics and other existing disciplines in several important ways. The emphasis on prediction is particularly strong in the machine learning and knowledge discovery in databases, or KDD, communities. The emphasis on predictive accuracy implicitly favors 'simple' theories over more complex theories in that the accuracy of sparser models tends to be more robust on future data. The requirement on predictive accuracy on observations that will occur in the future is a key consideration in data science.",,"Analysis of data; Complex theory; Knowledge creations; Knowledge discovery in database; Predictive accuracy; Predictive models; Sparser models; Systematic study; Computer applications; Computer science",,,,,,"Anderson, C., The end of theory: The data deluge makes the scientific method obsolete (2008) Wired, 16, p. 7. , June 23; Aral, S., Walker, D., Identifying influential and susceptible members of social networks (2012) Science, 337 (6092). , June 21; Buchan, I., Winn, J., Bishop, C., (2009) A Unified Modeling Approach to Data-Intensive Healthcare.

The two practical tasks used in the study each involved investigations of the relationships between two independent variables (IVs) and a dependent variable (DV); in both tasks, one IV covaried with the DV, whereas the other did not. Each was undertaken by 10 students, aged 10, 12, and 14 years (total n = 60 students), working individually. Their actions were video-recorded for analysis. In a subsequent interview, each student was asked to discuss and interpret data collected by two other students, undertaking a similar (but different) practical task, shown on a video-recording. An analysis of the sample students' performance on the practical tasks and their interview responses showed few differences across task contexts, or with age, in students' reasoning, but significant differences in performance when investigating situations of covariation and non-covariation. Few students in the sample displayed sufficient understanding of measurement error to deal effectively with the latter. Investigations of non-covariation cases revealed, much more clearly than investigations of covariation cases, the students' ideas about data and measurement, and their ways of reasoning from data. Such investigations therefore provide particularly valuable contexts for teaching and research. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"Curricula; Data acquisition; Philosophical aspects; Research and development management; Social aspects; Standards; Reasoning from data; Science investigations; Scientific knowledge; Teaching",,,,,,"(1989) Project 2061: Science for All Americans, , New York: Oxford University Press; Allie, S., Buffler, A., Kaunda, L., Campbell, B., Lubben, F., First-year physics students' perceptions of the quality of experimental measurements (1998) International Journal of Science Education, 20, pp. 447-459; Austin, R., Holding, B., Bell, J., Daniels, S., (1991) Assessment Matters No. 7: Patterns and Relationships in School Science, , London: School Examinations and Assessment Council (SEAC); Chinn, C.A., Brewer, W.F., An empirical test of a taxonomy of responses to anomalous data in science (1998) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 35, pp. 623-654; (1997) Common Framework of Science Learning Outcomes, , Toronto: CMEC; National Curriculum (1999) Science, , London: DfEE; Gott, R., Duggan, S., (1995) Investigative Work in the Science Curriculum, , Buckingham, UK: Open University Press; Harmon, M., Smith, T.A., Martin, M.O., Kelly, D.L., Beaton, A.E., Mullis, I.V.S., Gonzalez, E.J., Orpwood, G., (1997) Performance Assessment in IEA's Third International Mathematics and Science Study, , Chestnut Hill, MA: Center for the Study of Testing, Evaluation and Educational Policy, Boston College; Johnson, S., Assessment of performance unit (1989) National Assessment: the APU Science Approach, , London: HMSO; Klahr, D., Dunbar, K., Dual search space during scientific reasoning (1988) Cognitive Science, 12, pp. 1-48; Koslowski, B., (1996) Theory and Evidence: the Development of Scientific Reasoning, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Kuhn, D., Amsel, E., O'Loughlin, M., (1988) The Development of Scientific Thinking Skills, , London: Academic Press; Lubben, F., Millar, R., Children's ideas about the reliability of experimental data (1996) International Journal of Science Education, 18, pp. 955-968; Lubben, F., Campbell, B., Buffler, A., Allie, S., Point and set reasoning in practical science measurement by entering university freshmen (2001) Science Education, 85, pp. 311-327; Masnick, A.M., Morris, B.J., Reasoning from data: The effect of sample size and variability on children's and adults' conclusions (2002) Proceedings of the 24th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society, pp. 643-648. , W.D.

This is a value-added exploration (from Key Stage 3 [KS3] to KS4) aimed not at the student or the school level, but rather at that of the course. Different methodological approaches to carrying out such an analysis, ranging from simple non-contextualized techniques, to more complex fully contextualized multilevel models, are investigated and their limitations and benefits are evaluated. Important differences between courses are found in terms of the typical 'value' they add to the students studying them with particular applied science courses producing higher mean KS4 outcomes for the same KS3 level compared with other courses. The implications of the emergence of such differences, in a context where schools are judged to a great extent on their value-added performance, are discussed. The relative importance of a variety of student characteristics in determining KS4 outcomes are also investigated. Substantive findings are that across all types of course, science prior attainment at KS3, rather than that of mathematics or English, is the most important predictor of KS4 performance in science, and that students of lower socio-economic status consistently make less progress over KS4 than might be expected, despite prior attainment being accounted for in the modelling. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Curriculum reform; National data; Science education; Value-added",,,,,,,"Amrein-Beardsley, A., Methodological concerns about the education value-added assessment system (2008) Educational Researcher, 37 (2), pp. 65-75; Banner, I., Donnelly, J., Homer, M., Ryder, J., The impact of recent reforms in the KS4 science curriculum (2010) School Science Review, 92 (339), pp. 101-109; Banner, I., Ryder, J., Donnelly, J., The role of teachers' priorities for science education in the enactment of science curriculum reform.

Generally, big data refers to a data set with a size of hundreds of TB, or several PB or even above, and it is often distributed, heterogeneous and in low-quality. It is critical to devise novel methods to manage big data since traditional database management techniques are unfeasible to manage big data efficiently and effectively, though such techniques, especially the commercial relational DBMSs, have achieved great success in the past decades. This paper discusses concrete requirements and realistic challenges of Data-Intensive Science and Engineering (DISE), ranging from data storage and organization, computational method, data analysis, to user interfaces. Meanwhile, data quality, data security and data curation should be paid more attentions. In this paper, we attempt to describe the architecture of DISE, review the recent progress, and discuss the challenges and future work briefly.","Big data; Challenge; Data Intensive Science and Engineering (DISE); Requirement","Big datum; Challenge; Computational science; Data curation; Data quality; Data sets; Data storage; Database management; Experimental science; Low qualities; Novel methods; Recent progress; Requirement; Science and engineering; Scientific exploration; User interfaces; Security of data",,,,,,"Hay, T., Tansley, S., Tolle, K., (2009) The Fourth Paradigm: Data-Intensive Scientific Discovery, , Redmond, Washington: Microsoft Research; Big data: Science in the petabyte era (2008) Nature, 455, pp. 1-136; Dealing with data (2011) Science, 331 (6018), pp. 639-806; Xiao, N., Data-intensive computing (2011) Communications of the CCF, 7 (7), pp. 6-7. , in Chinese; Gao, M., Jin, C.-Q., Wang, X.-L., Tian, X.-X., Zhou, A.-Y., A survey on management of data provenance (2010) Chinese Journal of Computers, 33 (3), pp. 373-389. , in Chinese; Ghemawat, S., Gobioff, H., Leung, S.T., The Google file system (2003) Proceedings of the 19th ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, pp. 29-43. , Bolton Landing, NY; (2011) Hadoop: The Definitive Guide, , White Tom.

One of the key challenges in data-intensive science is development of enabling technologies to allow researchers to effectively utilize these large volumes of data in an effective manner. This paper introduces the concept of 'data prospecting' to address the challenges of data intensive science. With data prospecting, we extend the familiar metaphor of data mining to describe an initial phase of data exploration used to determine promising areas for deeper analysis. Data prospecting enhances data selection through the use of interactive discovery engines. Interactive exploration enables a researcher to filter the data based on the 'first look' analytics, discover interesting and previously unknown patterns to start new science investigations, verify the quality of the data, and corroborate whether patterns in the data match existing science theories or mental models. This paper describes our initial evaluation of the value of'data prospecting' to Earth Science researchers as part of their research process. The paper describes our discovery engine prototype to support data prospecting for specific data products along with its current limitations. Example science investigations from three different researchers using our prototype discovery engine to explore the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager and Sounder (SSM/I, SSMIS) data products are also presented. © 2013 IEEE.","Architecture; data analysis; data preprocessing; data systems; data visualization; information retrieval; remote sensing; sea surface","Data intensive science; Data preprocessing; Data systems; Enabling technologies; Interactive exploration; Scientific discovery; Sea surfaces; Special sensor microwave/Imager; Architecture; Data reduction; Data visualization; Engines; Information retrieval; Remote sensing; Research; academic research; conceptual framework; data acquisition; data mining; data processing; image processing; remote sensing; research work; SSM-I; visualization",,,,,,"Ahlberg, C., Williamson, C., Shneiderman, B., Dynamic queries for information exploration: An implementation and evaluation (1992) Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings, pp. 619-626; Anand, S.S., Patrick, A.R., Hughes, J.G., Bell, D.A., A data mining methodology for cross-sales (1998) Knowledge-Based Systems, 10 (7), pp. 449-461. , PII S0950705198000355; Bell, G., Hey, T., Szalay, A., Beyond the data deluge (2009) Science, 323 (6). , Mar; Berrick, S., Leptoukh, G., Liu, Z., Pham, L., Rui, H., Shen, S., Teng, W., Zhu, T., Multi-sensor distributive on-line processing, visualization and analysis system (2004) International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS), 3, pp. 2030-2033. , 2004 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium Proceedings: Science for Society: Exploring and Managing a Changing Planet.

The project leverages the Algorithm Development and Mining (ADaM) toolkit as the basis. The ADaM toolkit is a robust, mature and freely available science data mining toolkit that is being used by different research organizations and educational institutions worldwide. These deployable services will give the scientific community a powerful and versatile data mining capability that can be used to create higher order products such as thematic maps from current and future NASA satellite data records with methods that are not currently available. Many of the specialized data mining, pattern recognition, image processing and data preparation algorithms in ADaM are specifically geared towards satellite imagery, making these tools a perfect fit for NASA satellite data. In addition to providing specialized deployable data mining services, the suite will use the Earth Science Markup Language (ESML) to handle a variety of heterogeneous data formats seamlessly. ESML is another proven technology that, like ADaM, is in use by organizations worldwide. The deployable package of mining and related services are being developed using web services standards so that community based measurement processing systems can access and interoperate with them. The maturation of web services standards and technology sets the stage for a distributed ""Service-Oriented Architecture"" (SOA) for NASA's next generation science data processing. This architecture will allow members of the scientific community to create and combine persistent distributed data processing services and make them available to other users over the internet. The Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) will serve as an operational site for demonstration.",,"Algorithm development and minings; Data and information; Data preparation; Data-mining services; Distributed data processing; Earth science markup language; Educational institutions; Heterogeneous data; Higher order; NASA satellite; Processing systems; Research organization; Science data processing; Science-data; Scientific community; Thematic maps; Web services standards; Earth sciences; Image processing; Information services; Maps; Markup languages; NASA; Pattern recognition; Research; Satellite imagery; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Societies and institutions; Web services; Data processing",,,,,,"The Open Source BPEL Engine, , http://www.activebpel.org, accessed Jun, 2006; Apache AXIS SOAP Implementation, , http://ws.apache.org/axis, AXIS, accessed October 2006; NASA's Earth Observing System Clearinghouse, , http://www.echo.nasa.gov, ECHO, accessed October 2006; Hinke, T., Rushing, J., Kansal, S., Graves, S.J., Ranganath, H.S., Criswell, E., Eureka Phenomena Discovery and Phenomena Mining System (1997) AMS 13th International Conference on Interactive Information and Processing Systems (IIPS) for Meteorology, Oceanography and Hydrology, , presented at; Hinke, T., Rushing, J., Ranganath, H.S., Graves, S.J., Target-Independent Mining for Scientific Data: Capturing Transients and Trends for Phenomena Mining (1997) Proceedings Third International Conference on Data Mining (KDD-97), , presented at, Newport Beach, California; Hinke, T., Rushing, J., Ranganath, H.S., Graves, S.J., Techniques and Experience in Mining Remotely Sensed Satellite Data (2000) Artificial Intelligence Review: Issues on the Application of Data Mining, 14, pp. 503-531; Lynnes, C., Mack, R., KDD Services at the Goddard Earth Sciences Distributed Active Archive Center (2001) Data Mining for Scientific and Engineering Applications, pp. 165-181. , R.

One of the first instantiations implemented for NASA was the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) SIPS. The AMSR-E SIPS is a decentralized, geographically distributed ground data processing system composed of two primary components located in California and Alabama. Initial science data processing in the U.S. is conducted at Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) in Santa Rosa, California. RSS ingests antenna temperature orbit data sets from the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency and converts them to calibrated, resampled, geolocated brightness temperatures. The brightness temperatures are sent to the Global Hydrology and Climate Center in Huntsville, Alabama, which generates the geophysical science data products (e.g., water vapor, sea surface temperature, sea ice extent, etc.) suitable for climate research and applications usage. These science products are subsequently sent to the National Snow and Ice Data Center Distributed Active Archive Center in Boulder, Colorado for archival and dissemination to the at-large science community.

To link together inherently distributed data and applications generating this data, a data management solution is required that i) allows the integration of large amounts of data generated by instruments and analysis applications and ii) supports the ad-hoc loosely coupling of external applications with a common data management infrastructure. Then, dynamic data exchange between the internal and external data repository should be possible which includes feeding with external data by any application. Users of such a system should be able to assemble appropriate input data from the logically integrated data repository and run external applications provided by developers. In this paper, we present how we extended our B-Fabric life sciences data management system to support ad-hoc coupling and dynamic feeding of applications. We show how this can be realized on-the-fly with small expenses for the developer. We also sketch a mechanism how external applications can feed the B-Fabric data repository.

Earth science data are often the result of applying complex data transformation and analysis workflows to vast quantities of data. Provenance information of data processing is used for a variety of purposes, including understanding the process and auditing as well as reproducibility. Certain provenance information is essential for producing scientifically equivalent data. Capturing and representing that provenance information and assigning identifiers suitable for precisely distinguishing data granules and datasets is needed for accurate comparisons. This paper discusses scientific equivalence and essential provenance for scientific reproducibility. We use the example of an operational earth science data processing system to illustrate the application of the technique of cascading digital signatures or ""hash chains"" to precisely identify sets of granules and as provenance equivalence identifiers to distinguish data made in an an equivalent manner. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Data citations; Data identifiers; Equivalence; Provenance; Reproducibility","Data citations; Data identifiers; Equivalence; Provenance; Reproducibilities; Earth sciences; Granulation; Metadata; Data handling",,,,,,"Barkstrom, B., A mathematical framework for earth science data provenance tracing Earth Science Informaticsdoi, , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12145-010-0057-0, 10.1007/s12145-010-0057-0.

As an open space, e-Science Grid is expected to stimulate the collaborative researches and the cross domain ones. These research trends need a more efficient and convenient data service satisfying the science researchers. A dynamic bridge designed based on HVEM DataGrid, satisfies the users' requirements for the data sharing on e-Science Grid effectively. It supports a data tagging service in order for HVEM DataGrid to be utilized more extensively without any modification of the existing Grid architecture or services. Moreover, it can be adopted and deleted easily without any effect to the legacy Grid. With the legacyinterface to access data in e-Science Grid, the data tags endow the Grid with the flexibility for data access. This paper evaluates the usefulness of the dynamic bridge by analyzing its overhead and performance. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","a dynamic bridge; e-Science Grid; HVEM Data-Grid; science data sharing; Web 2.0 service",,,,,,,"Akito Monden, A.M., Thomborson, C., Tamper-resistant software system based on a finite state machine (2005) IEICE Transactions on Fundamentals of Electronics, Communications and Computer Science, 88 (1), pp. 112-122; Young Jung, I., Soon Cho, I., Yeom, H.Y., Kweon, H.S., Jysoo, L., HVEM datagrid: Implementation of a biologic data management system for experiments with high voltage electron microscope (2006) Distributed, High-Performance and Grid Computing in Computational Biology (GCCB, , Jan. 2007; http://ccdb.uscd.edu/CCDB/Kwak, S., Kim, J., A study on the development of high voltage electron microscope metadata model for efficient management and sharing (2007) Journal of Korean Library and Information Science Society, 38 (3), pp. 117-138; Fox, G.C., Web 2.0 for grids and e-science (2007) Instrumenting the Grid 2nd International Workshop on Distributed Cooperative Laboratories(INGRID, , ITALY, April, 2007; Fox, G.C., Web 2.0 for e-science environments. 3rd international conference on semantics (2007) Knowledge and Grid(SKG2007), , China, October; Fatih Mustacoglu, A., Ahmet, E.T.A.C., Fox, G., A novel event-based consistency model for supporting collaborative cyberinfrastructure based scientific research (2007) Proceedings of the 2007 International Symposium on Collaborative Technologies and Systems (CTS 2007); Pierce, M.E., Fox, G.C., Rosen, J., Maini, S., Choi, J.Y., Social networking for scientists using tagging and shared bookmarks: A web 2.0 application (2008) International Symposium on Collaborative Technologies and Systems (CTS 2008); Halpin, H., Robu, V., Shepherd, H., The complex dynamics of collaborative tagging (2007) Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on World Wide Web(WWW'07), pp. 211-220. , ACM, New York; Zhao, Y., Karypis, G., Fayyad, U., Hierarchical clustering algorithms for document datasets (2005) Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 10, pp. 141-168; Ding, C., He, X., K-means clustering via principal component analysis (2004) ACM International Conference Proceeding Series; Rose, K., Deterministic annealing for clustering, compression, classification, regression and related optimization problems (1998) Proc.

Furthermore, the current attention towards developing computer-based infrastructures and digital access to common data sets - the basics of scientific 'cyberinfrastructures' - are too-focused on fields of study characterized by data wealth. To better understand the implications of this twin pursuit of data wealth and cyberinfrastructure, I articulate how data-poor scholarly fields differ from data-rich fields. I then suggest four actions that scholars in data-poor fields can take to improve their work's value to science and society in lieu of being data-rich and propose three design considerations for cyberinfrastructures that can better support data-poor scholarly endeavors.","Computerization; Cyberinfrastructure; Data; E-science; Science","data set; infrastructure; poverty",,,,,,"Earlier versions of this essay were presented to the Information Systems Department at Case Western Reserve University's Weatherhead School of Management in March 2007; the 2007 Annual Meeting of the Society for the Social Studies of Science in October 2007; and as part of a panel at the International Conference of Information Systems in December 2007.

Science gateways, which serve as portals to scientific applications, have also evolved as researchers are dealing with rapidly expanding scientific datasets and the increasingly complex workflows. More and more gateways are being developed to support integrated services for running data-driven applications on HPC resources such as those on XSEDE. To facilitate this type of workflow, there is a pressing need for web-based data management systems that are easy to use, support data upload, sharing, access and management, and can be integrated with advanced computation and storage resources. More importantly such systems need to be accessible by users from the broad research and education communities. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of iData, a web-based community data publishing and sharing system. iData supports both generic file-based data collections and several commonly used environmental data collection formats including time series, GIS vector and raster data. Integrated data processing, visualization and filtering capabilities are provided for these data formats. Currently iData can be downloaded and deployed in a HUBzero-based gateway, and we plan to make it available for non-HUBzero platforms in the future. We present two examples in which iData has been successfully used to support research collaboration in driNET and GEOSHARE projects. © 2013 by the Association for Computing Machinery, Inc.","Community data; Data publishing; Data sharing; Geospatial data; HUBzero; Science gateway data management; XSEDE","Community data; Data publishing; Data Sharing; Geo-spatial data; HUBzero; Science gateway; XSEDE; Data acquisition; Data handling; Data visualization; Digital storage; Research; Websites; Information management",,,,,"#0753116, NSF, National Science Foundation","Mclennan, M., (2010) The Hub Concept for Scientific Collaboration, , http://hubzero.org/resources/12; http://hubzero.org/site/media/pressroom/hubzero-overview.pdfMike, W., Reagan, M., Wayne, S., Rajasekar, A., A prototype rule-based distributed data management system (2006) HPDC Workshop On, Next Generation Distributed Data Management, 102; GeoServer, , http://geoserver.org/; PostGIS, , http://postgis.net/; GRASS, , http://grass.osgeo.org/; Joomla!, , http://www.joomla.org/; OpenScales, , http://openscales.org/; DriNET, , http://drinet.hubzero.org/; Zhao, L., Song, C.X., Drinet: Drought research initiative network (2011) HUBbub 2011! the HUBzero Conference, , Indianapolis, IN; GEOSHARE, , http://geoshareproject.org/; Zhao, L., Song, C.X., Lee, J., Kim, J.R., Feng, W., Merwade, V., Villoria, N.B., Bring integrated GIS data and modeling capabilities into HUBzero platform (2011) Proceedings of the ACM SIGSPATIAL Second International Workshop on High Performance and Distributed Geographic Information Systems (HPDGIS '11), pp. 30-33. , ACM, New York, NY, USA; Global Land Project, , http://www.globallandproject.org/; Deryng, D., Sacks, W.J., Barford, C.C., Ramankutty, N., Simulating the effects of climate and agricultural management practices on global crop yield (2011) Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 25 (2), pp. GB2006; Mattmann, C.A., Crichton, D.J., Medvidovic, N., Hughes, S., A software architecture-based framework for highly distributed and data intensive scientific applications (2006) Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Software Engineering, pp. 721-730. , ACM; CartoDB, , http://cartodb.com; ArcGIS Online, , http://www.arcgis.com/about","Rosen Center for Advanced Computing, Purdue University, West Lafayette IN 47906, United States",,"Intel;Cray;Penguin Computing;IBM;Dell",,"Conference on Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment, XSEDE 2013","22 July 2013 through 25 July 2013","San Diego, CA",98539,,9781450321709,,,"English","ACM Int.

High throughput technologies produce a huge amount of primary data. In the classic scientific publication process, primary data is usually aggregated to a number of paragraphs in a journal article and proven by figures or tables. Whereas, in addition to such condensed knowledge, the authors add to their articles links to externally managed supplemental material. However, the older an article is, the lower is the chance that these links are still accessible [1]. In general many researchers are willing to share primary data, but in fact only few of them really provide their data sets [2]. The access is often restricted to the project associated users. Thus, values of primary data, on which the scientific results are based on, get increased attention in public and in the research community. This leads to novel strategies for primary data citation, which must be substantively underpinned by enhancements to classic data management systems, which should provide six general features, which are shown in Figure 1. The mentioned challenges in primary data management towards a consistent data publication process lead to the conclusion for the need of a universal platform for primary data management. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Data intensive science; Data management system; Data publications; High throughput technology; Research communities; Scientific publications; Scientific results; Universal platform; Astrophysics; Information management; Bioinformatics",,,,,,"Anderson, N.R., Tarczy-Hornoch, P., Bumgarner, R.E., On the persistence of supplementary resources in biomedical publications (2006) BMC Bioinformatics, 7, p. 260; Smith, V.S., Data publication: Towards a database of everything (2009) BMC Research Notes, 2, p. 113. , June; JBoss Community Hibernate, , http://www.hibernate.org/, [Online]; Mueller, T., H2 Database, , http://www.h2database.com/, [Online]; Apache Software Foundation Apache Lucene, , http://lucene.apache.org/core/, [Online]; JBoss Community Hibernate Search, , http://www.hibernate.org/subprojects/search.html, [Online]; DataCite Consortium DataCite, , http://datacite.org/, [Online]; Kiczales, G., Hilsdale, E., Hugunin, J., Kersten, M., Palm, J., Griswold, W.G., An overview of aspect (2001) Proceedings of the 15th European Conference on Object-Oriented Programming, , Springer- Verlag, London, UK; Rother, K., Potrzebowski, W., Puton, T., Rother, M., Wywial, E., Bujnicki, J.M., A toolbox for developing bioinformatics software (2012) Briefings in Bio Informatics, 13 (2), pp. 244-257; Kane, D., Hohman, M., Cerami, E., McCormick, M., Kuhlmman, K., Byrd, J., Agile methods in biomedical software development: A multi-site experience report (2006) BMC Bioinformatics, 7 (1), p. 273","Arend, D.; Cytogenetics and Genome Analysis/Bioinformatics and Information Technology, Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research (IPK), D-06466 Stadt Seeland OT Gatersleben, Germany",,"IEEE;IEEE Computer Society;National Science Foundation (NSF);OmicSoft Corporation;IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Bioinformatics",,"2012 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine Workshops, BIBMW 2012","4 October 2012 through 7 October 2012","Philadelphia, PA",96243,,9781467327466,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

In a service-oriented environment, the data, information, and knowledge are often consumed or produced by complex, distributed geoscientific workflows or service chains. In order for the chaining results to be consumable, sufficient metadata for data products to be delivered by service chains must be provided. This paper proposes automatic generation of geospatial metadata for Earth science virtual data products. A virtual data product is represented using process models, and can be materialized on demand by dynamically binding and chaining archived data and services, as opposed to requiring that Earth science data products be physically archived. Semantics-enabled geospatial metadata is generated, validated, and propagated during the materialization of a virtual data product. The generated metadata not only provides a context in which end-users can interpret data products before intensive execution of service chains, but also assures semantic consistency of the service chains. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Geoprocessing workflow; Geospatial web service; Metadata generation; Semantic web; Service chain; Virtual data product","Geoprocessing workflow; Geospatial web services; Metadata generation; Service chain; Virtual data; Earth sciences; Information services; Metadata; Semantic Web; Web services; data processing; Earth science; GIS; World Wide Web",,,,,,"Foster, I., Service-oriented science (2005) Science, 308 (5723), pp. 814-817; Yang, C., Raskin, R., Goodchild, M., Gahegan, M., Geospatial cyberinfrastructure: past, present and future (2010) Comput Environ Urban Syst, 34 (4), pp. 264-277; Brodaric, B., Fox, P., McGuinness, D.L., Geoscience knowledge representation in cyberinfrastructure (2007) Comput Geosci, 35 (4), pp. 697-868; Berners-Lee, T., Hendler, J., Lassila, O., The semantic web (2001) Sci Am, 284 (5), pp. 34-43; Yue, P., Gong, J., Di, L., He, L., Wei, Y., Integrating semantic web technologies and geospatial catalog services for geospatial information discovery and processing in cyberinfrastructure (2009) GeoInformatica, , doi:10.1007/s10707-009-0096-1; Greenberg, J., Spurgin, K., Crystal, A., Functionalities for automatic metadata generation applications: a survey of metadata experts' opinions (2006) Int J Metadata Seman Ontologies, 1 (1), pp. 3-20; Albassuny, B.M., Automatic metadata generation applications: a survey study (2008) Int J Metadata Seman Ontologies, 3 (4), pp. 260-282; Lemmens, R., Wytzisk, A., Rd, B., Granell, C., Gould, M., van Oosterom, P., Integrating semantic and syntactic descriptions to chain geographic services (2006) IEEE Internet Comput, 10 (5), pp. 18-28; Lutz, M., Ontology-based descriptions for semantic discovery and composition of geoprocessing services (2007) GeoInformatica, 11 (1), pp. 1-36; Percivall, G., (2002) The OpenGIS abstract specification, topic 12: OpenGIS service architecture, p. 78. , (ed), Version 4. 3, OGC 02-112.

Computing resource configuration required in data intensive science is being changed rapidly as well. Scientists have dynamic computing environment needs, which can be supported by cloud computing. We propose a light-weight cloud-based job management system to execute data analysis in distributed systems. In contrast to the traditional job managers based on scheduler with push mode, light-weight job coordinator is designed to process data request by pull mode in the proposed job management system. The agents in distributed virtual machine instances request the data URLs to be analyzed through the coordinator and dispatch the data from repositories. Using cloud service for provisioning of computing resources offers scalable, effective, and possibly massive computing environment. Hence the designed job management system is suitable for data intensive science requiring high throughput computing resources and reasonable I/O performance for big scientific data. In order to find out requirements and experiment system functions, we applied one of astronomy applications. © 2011 IEEE.","cloud computing; data intensive computing; science cloud; virtual cluster; virtualization","Cloud services; Computing environments; Computing resource; Data intensive; Data sets; Data-intensive computing; Distributed systems; Distributed virtual machines; Experiment system; High-throughput computing; I/O performance; Job management system; Light weight; Process data; Scientific applications; Scientific data; Virtual clusters; Virtualizations; Computer systems; Information management; Cloud computing",,,,,,"Condor, [Online], , http://www.cs.wisc.deu/condor/; Torque, [Online], , http://www.clusterresources.com/torquedocs21/; Hasenkamp, D., Sim, A., Wehner, M., Wu, K., Finding Tropical Cyclones on a Cloud Computing Clueter: Using Paraller Virtualiztion for Large-Scale Climate Simulation Analysis (2010) Second IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science, CloudCom 2010, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA, Proceedings, pp. 201-208. , IEEE, November 30-December 3; http://opennebula.org/, Onlinehttps://www.eucalyptus.com/, Onlinehttps://www.openstack.org, Onlinehttp://nimbusproject.org, OnlineSempolinski, P., Thain, D., A Comparison and Critique of Eucalyptus, OpenNebula and Nimbus (2010) Cloud Computing, Second International Conference, CloudCom 2010, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA, Proceedings, pp. 417-426. , IEEE, November 30-December 3; http://www.lsst.org/lsst/, Onlinehttp://www.superwasp.org/, OnlineShin, M.-S., Detecting variability in astronomical time series data: Applications of clustering methods in cloud computing environment IAU Symposium 285, September 19-September 23, 2011","Kim, H.; Dept. of Infrastructure Technology Development, Supercomputing Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information, Daejeon, South Korea; email: kamjum@kisti.re.kr",,"IEEE Computer Society;Association for Computing Machinery (ACM);IEEE Technical Committee on Scalable Computing (TCSC)",,"4th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Cloud and Utility Computing, UCC 2011","5 December 2011 through 8 December 2011","Melbourne, VIC",88244,,9780769545929,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

The JWST will produce approximately 235 gigabits (Gb) of science data every day. In order to get this data downlinked to the Deep Space Network (DSN) at a sufficiently adequate date rate, a Ka-band 26 gigahertz (GHz) frequency (as opposed to an X-band frequency) will be utilized. To support the JSWT's utilizations of Ka-band, the DSN is upgrading its infrastructure. The range of frequencies in the Kaband is becoming the new standard for high data rate science missions at L2. Given the Ka-band frequency range, the issues of alternative antenna deployment, off-nominal scenarios, NASA implementation of the Ka-band at 26 GHz, and navigation requirements will be discussed in this paper. The JWST is also using the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) standard process for reliable file transfer using CCSDS File Delivery Protocol (CFDP). For the JWST mission, the use of the CFDP protocol enables level zero processing at the DSN site. This paper will address NASA implementation of ground stations in support of Ka-band 26 GHz and lessons learned from implementing a file based protocol (CFDP). © 2008 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","CCSDS; Deep space network; DSN; JWST; Ka-band; L2","Consultative committee for space data systems; Data rates; Date rate; Deep space networks; File delivery protocol; Ground stations; High data rate; James Webb Space Telescope; Ka band; Lagrange points; Lessons learned; NASA missions; Reliable file transfer; Science data processing; Science missions; Science-data; X-band frequencies; Antenna arrays; Buildings; NASA; Observatories; Optical telescopes; Space flight; Space telescopes; Data processing",,,,,,,"Johns, A.; Goddard Space Flight Center/NASA, 8800 Greenbelt Road, Greenbelt, MD 20771, United States; email: alan.t.johns@nasa.gov",,"The International Society for Optical Engineering (SPIE);SPIE Europe",,"Observatory Operations: Strategies, Processes, and Systems II","24 June 2008 through 26 June 2008","Marseille",78735,0277786X,9780819472267,PSISD,,"English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-73449122305

Despite the availability of high-capacity connections, scientists struggle with inadequate cyberinfrastructure that cripples data transfer performance, and impedes scientific progress. The Science DMZ paradigm comprises a proven set of network design patterns that collectively address these problems for scientists. We explain the Science DMZ model, including network architecture, system configuration, cybersecurity, and performance tools, that creates an optimized network environment for science. We describe use cases from universities, supercomputing centers and research laboratories, highlighting the effectiveness of the Science DMZ model in diverse operational settings. In all, the Science DMZ model is a solid platform that supports any science workflow, and flexibly accommodates emerging network technologies. As a result, the Science DMZ vastly improves collaboration, accelerating scientific discovery. © 2014 - IOS Press and the authors.

How is art+science+immersion distinct from state-of-the art visualization? What does working with immersive environments and visualization offer that other approaches don't or can't? Where does immersion fall short? We will also explore current trends in the application of immersion for gaming, scientific data, entertainment, simulation, social media and other new forms of big data.

There are two sets of theory which frame the debate concerning science, technology and innovation, and which drive further methodological advancements. The power of a good visualization in providing insight to decision-makers is well known. Visualizations complete a full cycle of decision-making involving analysis, design, action and then further monitoring. We advance the paper by assessing available geographic information in science and technology databases. The paper then systematically outlines current best practices and alternatives for visualizing geographic data. Different geographic map options provide different possibilities for the display of data. We show some of these options in the paper. Future research is needed into both the available tools and techniques, as well as a more in depth specification of the kinds of decision support needs that exist and have a geo-spatial component. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Geo-visualization; Tech mining; Technological forecasting","Decision supports; Display of data; Geo visualizations; Geo-spatial data; Geographic information; Science and Technology; Tech minings; Tools and techniques; Decision support systems; Digital storage; Technological forecasting; Visualization; decision support system; forecasting method; GIS; innovation; mapping; science and technology; spatial data; visualization",,,,,,"Cooke, P., Urange, M.G., Extebarria, G., Regional innovation systems: institutional and organizational dimension (1997) Res.

Whereas the early days of research in this area were dominated by virtual integration systems (such as multi-/federated databases), the current predominantly used architecture uses materialization. Systems are built using ad-hoc techniques and a large amount of scripting. However, recent years have seen a shift in the understanding of what a data integration system actually should do, revitalizing research in this direction. In this tutorial, we review the past and current state of data integration for the Life Sciences and discuss recent trends in detail, which all pose challenges for the database community. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Ad-hoc techniques;

At the same time, the need to interactively explore complex and extensive biological datasets lead to development of advanced visualisation tools, many of which present the data in the form of a network graph. Semantic Web technologies offer both a means to define rich semantics necessary to describe complex biological systems and allow large amounts of data to be shared effectively. However, at present the need to be familiar with relevant technologies greatly impedes access to these datasets by the non-specialist Life Sciences researches. To address this, we have developed a software frame-work that facilitates both access to the resources and presents the data returned in an intuitive, graph-based format. Our framework is closely integrated with Ondex, an established data integration solution in the Life Sciences domain. The implementation consists of two parts. The first one is a query console that allows expert users to execute Semantic Web queries directly. The second one is a graph-based interactive browsing solution that can be used to launch stock queries by choosing items in the menu. In both cases, the result is re-formatted and visualised as a graph in Ondex frontend. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",,"Artificial intelligence; Bioinformatics; Complex networks; Complex biological systems; Expert users; Interactive browsing; Large amounts of data; Life sciences research; Life-sciences; Network graph; Semantic Web technology; Graphic methods",,,,,"BBSRC, Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council","Smoot, M.E., Ono, K., Ruscheinski, J., Wang, P.L., Ideker, T., Cytoscape 2.8: New features for data integration and network visualization (2011) Bioinformatics, 27 (3), pp. 431-432; Goble, C., Stevens, R., State of the nation in data integration for bioinformatics (2008) J.

To address this need, we put forth characteristics needed for rigorous, reproducible, and collaborative resources for data intensive science. Implementing a system with these characteristics exposed challenges in user interface, data distribution, and workflow description/ execution. We describe several responses to these challenges. The Data-Action-Queue metaphor addresses user interface and system organization concepts. A dynamic data distribution mechanism lays the foundation for the management of persistent datasets. The Makeflow workflow facilitates the simple description and execution of complex multipart jobs. The resulting web portal, Biocompute, has been in production use at the University of Notre Dame's Bioinformatics Core Facility since the summer of 2009. It has provided over seven years of CPU time through its three sequence search modules-BLAST, SSAHA, and SHRIMP-to ten biological and bioinformatic research groups spanning three universities. In this paper we describe the goals and interface to the system, its architecture and performance, and the insights gained in its development.

We describe ongoing responses to these and other challenges. Our Data-Action-Queue design pattern addresses user interface and system organization concepts. A dynamic data distribution mechanism lays the foundation for the management of persistent datasets. Makeflow facilitates the simple description and execution of complex multi-part jobs and forms the kernel of a module system powering diverse bioinformatics applications. Our improved web portal, Biocompute 2.0, has been in production use since the summer of 2010. Through it and its predecessor, we have provided over 56 years of CPU time through its five modules-BLAST, SSAHA, SHRIMP, BWA, and SNPEXP-to research groups at three universities.

Although MODIS band-to-band registration (BBR) was carefully characterized pre-launch, mis-registration between spectral bands and FPAs may still exist or occur during its on-orbit operation. Obviously the mis-registration, or the BBR shift, could impact the quality of MODIS science data products that are produced using multiple spectral bands. Because of the mis-registration, measurements over slightly different areas by different spectral bands, when used together, will cause undesired effects, and consequently, lead to less accurate data products. The spectro-radiometric calibration assembly (SRCA), a unique device within the MODIS instrument, is used to track the sensor on-orbit BBR during its entire mission. On-orbit results show that the mis-registration is typically very small for Terra MODIS but is relatively large for Aqua MODIS between the bands on the warm FPAs and that on the cold FPAs. In this paper we present a theoretical sensitivity analysis of the BBR shift characterization and its impact on MODIS data products. A real case is selected to estimate the impact on LIB data and science products using the BBR shift derived from the SRCA. As expected the mis-registration of Aqua MODIS produces small but potentially non-negligible impact on the science products, particularly at the mixed areas with various surface cover types.","Band-to-band registration; MODIS; Sensitivity analysis","Calibration; Orbits; Radiometry; Sensitivity analysis; Band-to-band registration; MODIS; Science data products; Image registration",,,,,,"Barnes, W.L., Xiong, X., Salomonson, V.V., Status of Terra MODIS and Aqua MODIS (2002) Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, 2, pp. 970-972. , IGARSS, IEEE Internaltional; Salomonson, V.V., Barnes, W.L., Xiong, X., Kempler, S., Masuoka, E., An Overview of the Earth Observing System MODIS Instrument and Associated Data Systems Performance (2002) Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, 2, pp. 1174-1176. , IGARSS, IEEE Internaltional; Barnes, W.L., Pagano, T.S., Salomonson, V.V., Prelaunch characteristics of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on EOS-AM1 (1998) IEEE Transaction on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 36, pp. 1088-1100; Xie, Y., Xiong, X., Qu, J.J., Che, N., Wang, L., MODIS on-orbit spatial characterization results using ground measurements (2006) Proceding of SPIE, 6296, pp. 62961L; Xiong, X., Chiang, K., Esposito, J., Guenther, B., Barnes, W., MODIS on-orbit calibration and characterization (2003) Metrologia, 40, pp. s89-s92; Nisihama, M., Wolfe, R.E., Fleig, A.J., Blanchette, J., Kuyper, J., MODIS geolocation algorithm and error analysis tools (2000) Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, 5, pp. 2053-2055. , IGARSS, IEEE Internaltional; Rouse, J.W., Haas, R.H., Schell, J.A., Deering, D.W., Monitoring vegetation systems in the Great Plains with ERTS (1973) ThirdERTS Symposium, pp. 309-317. , NASA SP-3511, pp; Huete, A., Justice, C., Liu, H., Development of vegetation and soil indices for MODIS-EOS (1994) Remote Sensing of Environment, 49, pp. 224-234; Hall, D.K., Riggs, G.A., Salomonson, V.V., Di Giromamo, N., Bayr, K.J., MODIS snow-cover products (2002) Remote Sensing of Environment, 83, pp. 181-194; Gao, B.C., NDWI - A Normalized Difference Water Index for Remote Sensing of Vegetation Liquid Water from Space (1996) Remote Sensing of Environment, 58, pp. 257-266; Qu, J.J., Hao, X., Kafatos, M., Wang, L., Asian Dust Storm Monitoring Combining Terra and Aqua MODIS SRB Measurements (2006) IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, 3, pp. 484-486; Montgomery, H., Che, N., Bowser, J., Determination of MODIS band-to-band co-registration on-orbit using the SRCA (2000) Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, IGARSS IEEE international, 5, pp. 2203-2205; Xiong, X., Che, N., Barnes, W., Terra MODIS on-orbit spatial characterization and performance (2005) IEEE Transaction on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 43, pp. 355-365","Xie, Y.; EaStFIRE Lab., Center for Earth Observing and Space Research (CEOSR), George Mason University (GMU), Fairfax, VA 22030, United States",,"The International Society for Optical Engineering (SPIE)",,"Remote Sensing and Modeling of Ecosystems for Sustainability IV","28 August 2007 through 29 August 2007","San Diego, CA",71821,0277786X,9780819468277,PSISD,,"English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-42149191409

We developed a questionnaire to support deeper understanding of user experiences with knowledge sharing activities. The results reveal that there are several challenging issues biologists encounter when using bioinformatics resources. A much smaller number of biologists have engaged in passive knowledge sharing within their research fields than we had expected. However, most biologists expressed their willingness to share their own knowledge with others. This result reinforces the need for more user-centered design approaches for supporting knowledge-sharing in rapidly emerging fields of data-intensive science. At the same time, our results suggest that more work is needed to examine how to best motivate users to further engage and contribute knowledge in online scientific communities. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","Data- Intensive Science; Knowledge-Sharing; User-centered Design Approach","Bioinformatics resources; Data- Intensive Science; Exploratory studies; Knowledge-sharing; Research process; Scientific community; User-centered design approaches; Willingness to share; Human computer interaction; Knowledge management; Bioinformatics",,,,,,"Bartlett, J., Ishimura, Y., Kloda, L., Why choose this one?: Factors in scientists' selection of bioinformatics tools (2011) Information Research, 16 (1), p. 15; Bartlett, J., Neugebauer, T., Supporting information tasks with user-centred system design: The development of an interface supporting bioinformatics analysis (2005) Canadian Journal of Information and Library Science, 29 (4), pp. 486-487; Bell, G., Hey, T., Szalay, A., Beyond the data deluge (2009) Science, 323 (5919), pp. 1297-1298; Bock, G.W., Zmud, R.W., Kim, Y.G., Lee, J.N., Behavioral intention formation in knowledge sharing: Examining the roles of extrinsic motivators, social-psychological forces, and organizational climate (2005) MIS Quarterly, pp. 87-111; Bolchini, D., Better bioinformatics through usability analysis (2009) Bioinformatics, 25 (3), pp. 406-412. , (Oxford, England) doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btn633; Bolchini, D., Finkestein, A., Paolini, P., Designing Usable Bio-information Architectures (2009) LNCS, 5613, pp. 653-662. , Jacko, J.A.

To provide authenticity and provenance information, comprehensive metadata models are deployed to document information on an object's context. Yet, we claim that simply documenting an objects context may not be sufficient to ensure proper provenance and to fulfill the stated preservation goals. Specifically in e-Science and business settings, capturing, documenting and preserving entire processes may be necessary to meet the preservation goals. We thus present an approach for capturing, documenting and preserving processes, and means to assess their authenticity upon re-execution. We will discuss options as well as limitations and open challenges to achieve sound preservation, specifically within scientific processes.","Context; Digital preservation; EScience; Processes","Context; Data objects; Digital files; Digital preservation; e-Science; Metadata model; Re-execution; Processing; Semantics; Digital image storage",,,,,,"Becker, C., Antunes, G., Barateiro, J., Vieira, R., A capability model for digital preservation: Analysing concerns, drivers, constraints, capabilities and maturities (2011) 8th International Conference on Preservation of Digital Objects (IPRES 2011), , Singapore, November; Becker, C., Antunes, G., Barateiro, J., Vieira, R., Control objectives for dp: Digital preservation as an integrated part of it governance (2011) Proceedings of the 74th Annual Meeting of the American Society for Information Science and Technology (ASIST), , New Orleans, Lousiana, US, October; Guttenbrunner, M., Rauber, A., A measurement framework for evaluating emulators for digital preservation (2012) ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS), 30 (2); Guttenbrunner, M., Rauber, A., Evaluating an emulation environment: Automation and significant key characteristics (2012) Proceedings of the 9th Conference on Preservation of Digital Objects (iPRES2012), , Toronto, Canada, October 1-5; Guttenbrunner, M., Rauber, A., Evaluating emulation and migration: Birds of a feather?

It will help to examine and approve the project of science and technology more scientifically and make the achievement transformed as the realistic productive forces easier. Therefore, the data mine technology will be researched and applied to the science and technology management information system to find and excavate the knowledge in the paper. According to analyzing the disadvantages of traditional science and technology management information system, the database technology, data mining and web geographic information systems (WebGIS) technology will be introduced to develop and construct the science and technology management information system based on WebGIS. The key problems are researched in detail such as data mining and statistical analysis. What's more, the prototype system is developed and validated based on the project data of National Natural Science Foundation Committee. The spatial data mining is done from the axis of time, space and other factors.

NASA's Earth Science Data Systems (ESDS) directly support this objective by providing end-to-end capabilities to deliver data and information products to users. The Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) is the largest of NASA's ESDS. Dozens of satellites contribute to the multi-petabyte EOSDIS archive, which consists of data and derived products in variety of Earth science disciplines. These products are currently being distributed to hundreds of thousands of users each year at the rate of 7 to 10 Terabytes a day. EOSDIS is a distributed, heterogeneous set of systems located at several NASA centers, other federal agencies and universities. Operating since 1994, EOSDIS has evolved from a near-line tape-based system to an online disk-based archive. The distributed components of EOSDIS are interoperable at the ""inventory level"" to provide ""one-stop shopping"" for access to data files. EOSDIS supports NASA's open data policy whereby data are available to users at no charge and on a non-discriminatory basis. One of the requirements of EOSDIS is to ensure that the data are preserved in its archives or are transitioned to other permanent archival agencies. From the point of view of long-term preservation of digital data, ""temporal interoperability"" is critical. This is enabled by media standards, migration policies, and standards for metadata and documentation.","Data preservation; Data systems; Earth science; Interoperability; Remote sensing","Data and information; Data files; Data preservation; Data systems; Derived products; Digital datas; Disk-based; Distributed components; Earth observing systems; Earth science data systems; Federal agency; Future directions; Inventory levels; Long-term preservation; Migration policy; One stop; Science disciplines; Strategic objectives; Digital storage; Earth sciences; Interoperability; Metadata; NASA; Remote sensing; Earth (planet)",,,,,,"(2006) 2006 NASA Strategic Plan, p. 8. , NASA; Data and information policy (2006) Earth Science Reference Handbook, pp. 35-36. , NASA; Ramapriyan, H.K., (2003) NASA's Earth Science Data Systems - Past, Present and Future, IGARSS 2003, , Toulouse, France (July 21-25); Ramapriyan, H.K., (2009) EOS Data and Information System (EOSDIS): Where We Were and Where We Are, in Earth Observer, 21 (4). , http://eospso.gsfc.nasa.gov/eos_homepage/for_scientists/earth_observer. php, July-August; Ramapriyan, H.K., McConaughy, G.R., Version 0 EOSDIS - An overview (1991) ACSM-ASPRS Annual Convention, 3, pp. 352-362. , Technical Papers; (1995) A Review of the U.S Global Change Research Program and NASA's Mission to Planet Earth/Earth Observing System, , National Research Council, National Academy Press, Washington, D.C; Maiden, M.E., (2000) NewDISS: A 6-to 10-year Approach to Data Systems and Services for NASA's Earth Science Enterprise, , Draft Version 1.0, NASA, February 2000; Esfandiari, M., Evolution of the earth observing system (EOS) (2006) Data and Information System (EOSDIS), IGARSS 2006, , Denver (July 31 - Aug 4); Ramapriyan, H.K., Evolution of the earth observing system (EOS) data and information system (EOSDIS) (2009) Standard-Based Data and Information Systems for Earth Observation, , Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg, L.

Data mining, information theoretic, and machine learning techniques-such as cluster analysis, singular value decomposition, block entropy, Fourier and wavelet analysis, phase-space reconstruction, and artificial neural networks-are being applied to problems of segmentation, feature extraction, change detection, model-data comparison, and model validation. The size and complexity of Earth science data exceed the limits of most analysis tools and the capacities of desktop computers. New scalable analysis and visualization tools, running on parallel cluster computers and supercomputers, are required to analyze data of this magnitude. This workshop will demonstrate how data mining techniques are applied in the Earth sciences and describe innovative computer science methods that support analysis and discovery in the Earth sciences. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Change detection; Data mining; High performance computing; Remote sensing; Segmentation; Synthesis; Visualization","Analysis tools; Block entropy; Change detection; Data mining techniques; Earth science data; Earth system science; Field scale; Fourier; Global climate simulations; High performance computing; Long time series; Model validation; Parallel clusters; Phase space reconstruction; Scalable analysis; Support analysis; Visualization tools; Cluster analysis; Computer software selection and evaluation; Data visualization; Earth (planet); Earth sciences; Feature extraction; Information theory; Neural networks; Personal computers; Phase space methods; Remote sensing; Signal detection; Singular value decomposition; Space optics; Supercomputers; Systems science; Time series; Visualization; Wavelet analysis; Wavelet decomposition; Data mining",,,,,,"Xue, Y., Hoffman, F.M., Liu, D., GeoComputation 2009 (2009) Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS 2009), pp. 345-348. , G.

Within the NASA Earth science data systems community, there are a number of distinct applications, ranging from interactions amongst science investigator led processing systems (SIPS), which focus on active data processing, algorithm experimentation and evaluation, and the reuse of instrument processing approaches; to NASA's Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) that are responsible for outward facing data dissemination to the public, and where long term preservation of data and reuse are distinctly important; all the way to downstream proposal led systems, where investigators are funded by NASA to reuse data and software to produce fused data products, and to aggregate and reuse NASA data systems in a systems-of-systems manner. Recognizing the need for a coordinated effort to inform the reuse of components within the NASA ecosystem, we are developing a strategic approach for the development and reuse of open source software.

A selected set of operational science projects were chosen to establish processing needs, analysis capabilities, communication requirements, and to provide overall system design requirements for an eventual operational system in the 1990's. This approach provides accurate and timely inputs from the users to ensure basic analysis requirements which then can be used to drive the system's functional and operational requirements. The system will be distributed in nature, limited in scale and will address: 1. o Data management which will establish a central directory, provide advanced data access and storage, browse and catalog capabilities and a natural language interface. This capability will support the management of spatial data and other related data, along with value-added information management services for supporting land related research. 2. o Communication capabilities that will allow the efficient, rapid transfer of data sets from one remote location to another, and interconnection with data bases and computers. These services include electronic mail, remote log-in, and file transfer. 3. o Land analysis software tools that will incorporate sensor calibration, radiometric and geometric correction. It will also provide advanced algorithms for spatial and textural analysis and modeling. 4. o System access capabilities which will address data format standardization and protocols. It will also simplify access to central resources, provide for selected access to currently unaccessible processors and data, place tools for processing data directly under the management of the scientist, improve data display, and simplify user interaction with software. 5. o Special processes which will support the inclusion of hardware and software developed outside of PLDS as appropriate to a specific needed capability and that do not conflict with any specific existing technical development. Artificial intelligence design concepts will be employed in the PLDS in order to develop a goal-oriented system that has value-added services that will allow the system to support the scientist in an intelligent manner. An intelligent PLDS will provide a very friendly interface for the user. Such an interface means that much of the knowledge that is presently required to operate a computer system will be unnecessary because communication between user and system will be done using human rather than computer languages. To accomplish these things will require a close working relationship between land and information scientists to translate future research processing needs and information science capabilities. The ultimate purpose is to improve the quality of worldwide land related research, and to integrate this system into an operational global research tool. © 1986.",,"COMPUTER SOFTWARE; DATABASE SYSTEMS; INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS; MAPS AND MAPPING; SYSTEMS ENGINEERING; DATA MANAGEMENT; LAND SCIENCE DATA MANAGEMENT; PILOT LAND DATA SYSTEM; USER INTERFACE; REMOTE SENSING",,,,,,,"Campbell, W.J.; NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center, Code 634, Greenbelt, MD 20771, United States",,,,,,,,00489697,,STEVA,,"English","Sci.

Earth science data collections and supporting documentation differ from textual document collections in three important ways:1) Data elements in Earth science have at least five coupled attributes some of which are not textual. 2)Earth science data has strong ties to mathematical models of their measurement process. 3)Data production can involve complex scenarios that couple data and documentation. These scenarios induce cataloging problems similar to those librarians experience for serials with successive issuance and multiple versions of similar entities. Users may benefit from a navigational approach to accessing appropriate data and documentation: 1)Current approaches throw responsibility for meeting user needs onto software query systems that act as though they are trying to read the user's mind.2) A more appropriate division of responsibility between the system and its users would allow the user to dialog with the system in navigating through its knowledge base. The first objective of this paper is to explore Formal Concept Analysis for classification of Earth science data collections. The second is to outline a novel search approach that engages the user in a navigational dialog.","Earth science data; Formal concept analysis; Navigational search","Classification approach; Data elements; Data production; Earth science data; Knowledge base; Measurement process; Navigational search; Textual documents; Cybernetics; Data acquisition; Earth sciences; Formal concept analysis; Information analysis; Knowledge based systems; Mathematical models; Navigation; Search engines",,,,,,"Abello, J., Pogel, A.J., Miller, L., Breadth first search graph partitions and concept lattices (2004) J.

In the past decades, many countries including developed countries and developing countries paid more attention on geosciences data sharing and related e-infrastructure construction. Because geosciences data have typical multi-sources, multi-types, cross disciplines features, they haven't common data model and related benchmark. This causes lots of geosciences data can't be integrated and shared web sharing oriented. Faced to this problem, the paper analyzed geosciences data multi-dimensions features, including their disciplinary dimension, thematic dimension, spatial scale dimension, temporal dimension, application dimension, etc. Geosciences data concept model with common dimensions was designed based on case study on Data Sharing Network of Earth System Science (DSNESS), which is one of important platforms of SDSP and NSTI. Three common data benchmark of this model are researched based on the geosciences data in DSNESS, i.e., data elements dimension benchmark, spatial dimension and temporal dimension benchmark. Element dimension focuses on the element classification structure and coding system, spatial dimension is contribute to the construction of data spatial reference based on grid, temporal dimension is helpful for the construction of time serials data sets according to the frequency of data updating. The common data benchmark is used in DSNESS and has been proved useful for geosciences data integration and sharing initially.","Data model; Data sharing; Data standards; Geosciences","Classification structure; Coding system; Common data model; Concept model; Cross-disciplines; Data elements; Data models; Data sets; Data Sharing; Data standards; Data updating; Developed countries; Earth system science; Geosciences; Geosciences data; Infrastructure construction; Science research; Social development; Spatial dimension; Spatial reference; Spatial scale; Temporal dimensions; Web sharing; Classification (of information); Developing countries; Models; Ocean habitats; Systems science; Research",,,,,,"Xu, G.-H., Open Access to Scientific Data: Promoting Science and Innovation (2007) Data Science Journal, 6 (OPEN DATA ISSUE), pp. OD21-OD25; Xu, G., Advance for enhance China's science and technology innovation capacity by data sharing (2003) China Basic Science Research, (1), pp. 5-9; (2009) Review and Prospective of Natioanl Science and Technology Infrastructure, , National Science and Technology Infrastructure Center, Beijing: Science Press; Huang, D., Lin, H., Zhang, Z., (2005) Strategy Study on Earth System Science Development, , Beijing: Meteorology Publishing House; (2005) Long-Lived Digital Data Collections: Enabling Research and Education in the 21st Century, , NSF Board; http://gcmd.nasa.gov/China Standards Information, , http://www.chinaios.com/, website; Li, J., Fei, Y., Geosciences data integration review (2000) Geographic Science Progress, 19, pp. 203-211; Sun, J., Shi, H., Construction of Earth System Science Data Sharing Network in China (2003) China Basic Science Research, (1), pp. 76-82; Sun, J., Lin, H., (2009) Earth System Study and Scientific Data, , Beijing: Science Press","Wang, J.; Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China; email: wangjl@igsnrr.ac.cn",,"IEEE GRSS;The Geographical Society of China",,"2010 18th International Conference on Geoinformatics, Geoinformatics 2010","18 June 2010 through 20 June 2010","Beijing",81943,,9781424473021,,,"English","Int.

This is a time-consuming and challenging task, especially when science objectives require users to deal with large multi-sensor data that are usually in different formats and internal structures. The Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) has created the GES DISC Interactive Online Visualization and ANalysis Infrastructure, ""Giovanni,"" to enable Web-based visualization and analysis of satellite remotely sensed meteorological, oceanographic, and hydrologic data sets, without users having to download data. The current operational Giovanni system contains eight different interfaces that provide the capability to process a number of important satellite measurements. Depending on the input data structure, the system provides different simple statistical analysis and creates many useful plot type images or ASCII output. Giovanni handles data with different temporal and spatial resolutions and, thus, enables both regional and global long-term climate research and short-term special events investigation, as well as data validations and assessments. Because of its simplicity of usage, Giovanni is powerful and versatile, able to assist a wide range of users, from the discipline scientists conducting preliminary research in various fields, to students in the classroom learning about weather, climate, and other natural phenomena.",,"Classroom learning; Climate research; Data and information; Data validation; Earth science data; Hydrologic data; Input datas; Internal structure; Multi-sensor data; Natural phenomena; Online visualizations; Satellite measurements; Science objectives; Spatial resolution; Statistical analysis; Visualization and analysis; Web-based visualization; Data structures; Earth sciences; Information services; Remote sensing; Research; Visualization; Data visualization",,,,,,"Centurioni, L.R., Niiler, P.P., Observations of Inflow of Philippine Swa Surface Water into the South China Sea through the Luzon Strait (2004) J.

In order to retrieve relevant data sets from a query, which may not include technical terminologies, supplementing terms are extracted by utilizing knowledge bases; Wikipedia and domain ontology.

Data assimilation is required to extract information about geophysical fields of interest from the remote sensing observations and to make the data more accessible to users. Remote sensing may provide, for example, measurements of surface soil moisture, snow water equivalent, snow cover, or land surface (skin) temperature. Data assimilation can then be used to estimate variables that are not directly observed from space but are needed for applications, for instance root zone soil moisture or land surface fluxes. The paper provides a brief introduction to modern data assimilation methods in the Earth sciences, their applications, and pertinent research questions. Our general overview is readily accessible to hydrologic remote sensing scientists. Within the general context of Earth science data assimilation, we point to examples of the assimilation of remotely sensed observations in land surface hydrology. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The Information Technology and Systems Center at the University of Alabama in Huntsville is developing an interchange technology focused on scientific data in general, and particularly on the vast amounts of remotely sensed Earth Science data. This interchange technology consists of the Earth Science Markup Language (ESML) and a related library of programming utilities. ESML, based on the eXtensible Markup Language (XML), allows data format structure descriptions to be written in a standard manner. ESML is unique in that it is not another new data format, instead it is a external structural metadata based solution for decoding existing formats. The effort involved to describe legacy data formats in ESML is small. ESML and the associated software library will allow wider interoperability of Earth Science services and tools, enabling Earth Scientists to work more easily with data in a variety of formats. This interchange technology will facilitate the development of data format independent search, visualization, and analysis tools. This paper will describe this interchange technology and compare it with similar XML based efforts. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

For the integration and share of scientific data in materials science, a semantic model for materials scientific data is designed based on ontology technology. The semantic model covers the key concepts in materials science and their semantic relationships. With the semantic model which is considered as the global conceptual model, a semantic integration method is proposed, where mappings between the semantic model and local ontology as well as mappings between local ontology and data schema are built to make seamless semantic interoperability possible. Furthermore, the architecture and implementation details for the mappings are presented.

We apply a realistic workload from this application against our Calder stream processing system to determine effective throughput, event processing latency, data access scalability, and deployment latency.1 © 2006 IEEE.",,"Data mining; Forecasting; Grid computing; Rivers; Weather forecasting; Architectural frameworks; Computational sciences; Data accessing; Data driven (DD); Data stream processing; Effective throughput; event processing; international conferences; Large-scale data; Real time data streaming; Scientific applications; Stream processing; Weather prediction; Data processing",,,,,,"Stonebraker, M., Cetintemel, U., Zdonik, S., The 8 requirements of real-time stream processing (2005) SIGMOD Rec, 34 (4); Arasu, A., Babcock, B., Babu, S., Cieslewicz, J., Datar, M., Ito, K., Motwani, R., Widom, J., Stream: The Stanford data stream management system (2004) Data Stream Management; Johnson, T., Cranor, C.D., Spatscheck, O., Gigascope: A stream database for network application (2003) ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data; Koparanova, M.G., Risch, T., High-performance stream-oriented grid database manager for scientific data (2003) 1st European Across Grids Conference; Arasu, A., Babu, S., Widom, J., The CQL continuous query language: Semantic foundations and query execution (2005) In Very Large Database (VLDB) Journal, 14 (1); Luckham, D., (2002) The Power of Events, , Addison Wesley; Brownston, L., Farrell, R., Kant, E., Martin, N., (1985) Programming Expert Systems in OPS5, , Addison Wesley; Luckham, D.C., Vera, J., An event-based architecture definition language (1995) IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 21 (9), pp. 717-734; Altinel, M., Franklin, M.J., Efficient filtering of XML documents for selective dissemination of information (2000) The Very Large Database VLDB Conference; Nguyen, B., Abiteboul, S., Cobena, G., Preda, M., Monitoring XML data on the Web (2001) SIGMOD Record, 30 (2), pp. 437-448; Avnur, R., Hellerstein, J.M., Eddies: Continuously adaptive query processing (2000) ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data; Chandrasekaran, S., Cooper, O., Deshpande, A., Franklin, M.J., Hellerstein, J.M., Hong, W., Krishnamurthy, S., Shah, M.A., Telegraphcq: Continuous dataflow processing for an uncertain world (2003) Conference on Innovative Database systems Research (CIDR); Vijayakumar, N., Liu, Y., Plale, B., Calder query grid service: Insights and experimental evaluations (2006) CCGrid Conference; Abadi, D.J., Ahmad, Y., Balazinska, M., Cetintemel, U., Cherniack, M., Hwang, J.-H., Lindner, W., Zdonik, S., The Design of the Borealis Stream Processing Engine (2005) Second Biennial Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research (CIDR) Conference; Catalyurek, U.V., Supporting large scale data driven science in distributed environments (2005) Minisymposium on Distributed Data Management Infrastructures for Scalable Computational Science and Engineering Applications, SIAM Conference on Computational Science and Engineering (SIAM CSE '05); Plale, B., Leveraging run time knowledge about event rates to improve memory utilization in wide area data stream filtering (2002) IEEE International Symposium on High Performance Distributed Computing; Plale, B., Vijayakumar, N., Evaluation of rate-based adaptivity in joining asynchronous data streams (2005) 19th IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium, , April; Abadi, D., Carney, D., Cetintemel, U., Cherniack, M., Convey, C., Lee, S., Stonebraker, M., Zdonik, S., Aurora: A new model and architecture for data stream management (2003) In Very Large Database (VLDB) Journal, 12 (2), pp. 120-139; Domenico, B., Unidata internet data distribution: Real-time data on the desktop (2005) Science Information Systems Interoperability Conference (SISIC); K.

These measurements provide unique and much needed data for the atmospheric research and applications communities. The GES DAAC archives approximately 500 Gigabytcs (GB) of MODIS data per day. The full suite of Atmosphere products is archived at the NASA GES DAAC at a rate of about 40 GB/day. A significant increase in the volume of Atmospheric data being ingested, archived and distributed at the GES DAAC will occur when the MODIS instrument onboard the Aqua (formally PM-1) spacecraft begins transmission. The data is distributed to the community through a combination of EOS Data Gateways, the GES DAAC Search and Order World Wide Web (WWW) interface and an FTP site that contains samples of MODIS data.

Much of this data does not live in the cloud or on the Web, but rather in multi-institutional data centers that provide tools and add value through quality assurance, validation, curation, dissemination, and analysis of the data. In this paper, we make the case for the use of scientific scenarios in Linked Science. We propose a scenario in river-channel transport that requires biogeochemical experimental data and global climate-simulation model data from many sources. We focus on the use of ontologies-formal machine-readable descriptions of the domain-to facilitate search and discovery of this data. Mercury, developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, is a tool for distributed metadata harvesting, search and retrieval. Mercury currently provides uniform access to more than 100,000 metadata records; 30,000 scientists use it each month. We augmented search in Mercury with ontologies, such as the ontologies in the Semantic Web for Earth and Environmental Terminology (SWEET) collection by prototyping a component that provides access to the ontology terms from Mercury. We evaluate the coverage of SWEET for the ORNL Distributed Active Archive Center (ORNL DAAC). © 2013 # Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg (outside the USA).","BioPortal; Climate change; Data discovery; Linked Science; Ontologies; Semantic search","climate change; data acquisition; data set; metadata",,,,,,"Bernholdt, D., Bharathi, S., Brown, D., Chanchio, K., Chen, M.L., Chervenak, A., The Earth System Grid: supporting the next generation of climate modeling research (2005) Proc IEEE, 93, pp. 485-495; Bruskiewich, R., Coe, E.H., Jaiswal, P., McCouch, S., Polacco, M., Stein, L., The plant ontology (TM) consortium and plant ontologies (2002) Comp Funct Genom, 3, pp. 137-142; Castells, P., Fernandez, M., Vallet, D., An adaptation of the vector-space model for ontology-based information retrieval (2007) IEEE Trans Knowl Data Eng, 19, pp. 261-272; Chu-Carroll, J., Prager, J., Czuba, K., Ferrucci, D., Duboue, P., (2006) Semantic search via XML fragments: a high-precision approach to IR, pp. 445-452. , In: (ed) Vol. ACM; Devarakonda, R., Palanisamy, G., Wilson, B.E., Green, J.M., Mercury: reusable metadata management, data discovery and access system (2010) Earth Sci Inform, 3, pp. 87-94; Devarakonda, R., Palanisamy, G., Green, J.M., Wilson, B.E., Data sharing and retrieval using OAI-PMH (2011) Earth Sci Inform, 4, pp. 1-5; Doney, S.C., The growing human footprint on coastal and open-ocean biogeochemistry (2010) Science, 328, pp. 1512-1516; Fink, D., Hochachka, W.M., Zuckerberg, B., Winkler, D.W., Shaby, B., Munson, M.A., Spatiotemporal exploratory models for broad-scale survey data (2010) Ecol Appl, 20, pp. 2131-2147; Gent, P.R., Danabasoglu, G., Donner, L.J., Holland, M.M., Hunke, E.C., Jayne, S.R., The community climate system model version 4 (2011) J Clim, 24, pp. 4973-4991; Gil, Y., Ratankar, V., Hanson, P., Organic data publishing: a novel approach to scientific data sharing (2012) Proceedings of the 2nd international workshop on linked science, 951. , CEUR, Boston, MA; Hogan, A., Harth, A., Umbrich, Jr., Kinsella, S., Polleres, A., Decker, S., Searching and browsing linked data with SWSE: the semantic web search engine (2011) Web Semant Sci Serv Agents World Wide Web, 9, pp. 365-401; Kauppinen, T., de Espindola, G., Linked open science?

High-energy physics is usually conducted at major accelerator sites, in which detector design, construction, signal processing, data acquisition, and data analysis are performed on a large scale. However, in order to study high-energy physics anytime and anywhere even if we are not on-site at accelerator laboratories, we have created a new research paradigm, e-Science. The e-Science for high-energy physics has three components: data production, data processing, and data analysis. In this paper, we focus on the data processing of e-Science for high-energy physics.

The hyper spectral data have 190 bands and it is necessary to decline the bands for performing the classification. We want to classify with high accuracy by using suitable bands. For the reason, we conduct feature selection and the feature selection is the method for getting suitable bands from many bands. For the feature selection, training data are necessary and we use field survey data for the training data. Using suitable bands, feature extraction transform method is performed for data reduction.

Sensors, algorithms and processing systems for transforming and analyzing the data are evolving over time. Web Portals and Services can create transient data sets on-demand. Data are transferred from organization to organization with additional transformations at every stage. Provenance in this context refers to the source of data and a record of the process that led to its current state. It encompasses the documentation of a variety of artifacts related to particular data. Provenance is important for understanding and using scientific datasets, and critical for independent confirmation of scientific results. Managing provenance throughout scientific data processing has gained interest lately and there are a variety of approaches. Large scale scientific datasets consisting of thousands to millions of individual data files and processes offer particular challenges. This paper uses the analogy of art history provenance to explore some of the concerns of applying provenance tracking to earth science data.

Finding association patterns among these events has great significance. Because data in earth science has characteristics of mass, high dimension, spatial autocorrelation and time delay, existing mining technologies cannot be directly used on it. We propose a RSNN (range-based searching nearest neighbors) spatial clustering algorithm to reduce the data size and auto-correlation. Based on the clustered data, we propose a GEAM (geographic episode association pattern mining) algorithm which can deal with events time lags and find interesting patterns with specific constraints, to mine the association patterns. We carried out experiments on global climate datasets and found many interesting association patterns. Some of the patterns are coincident with known knowledge in climate science, which indicates the correctness and feasibilities of our methods, and the others are unknown to us before, which will give new information to this research field. © 2008 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.","Abnormal events; Association patterns; Earth science data; High dimensional clustering","Algorithms; Boolean functions; Earth sciences; Evolutionary algorithms; Mining; Scheduling algorithms; Technology; Abnormal events; association patterns; Auto-correlation (AC); climate science; Data size; Data-sets; Earth science data; Global climates; high dimensions; Human societies; Natural environments; Nearest Neighbor (NN); pattern mining; Spatial autocorrelation (SPAC); Spatial clustering; Springer (CO); Time lags; Clustering algorithms",,,,,,"Wold, S., Principal component analysis (1987) Chemom Intell Lab Syst, 2, pp. 37-52; Klema, V., Laub, A., The singular value decomposition: Its computation and some applications (1980) IEEE Trans Autom Contr, 25, pp. 164-176. , 2; Mannila, H., Toivonen, H., Verkamo, A., (1995) Discovering Frequent Episodes in Sequences, pp. 210-215. , AAAI Press New York; Mannila, H., Toivonen, H., Verkamo, A., Discovery of frequent episodes in event sequences (1997) Data Min Knowl Disc, 1, pp. 259-289. , 3; Garriga, G.C., (2003) Discovering Unbounded Episodes in Sequential Data, pp. 83-93. , Springer Berlin; Meger, N., Rigotti, C., (2004) Constraint-Based Mining of Episode Rules and Optimal Window Sizes, pp. 313-324. , Springer Berlin; Tobler, W., A computer movie simulating urban growth in the detroit region (1970) Econ Geogr, 46, pp. 234-240; Ertz, L., Steinbach, M., Kumar, V., (2001) Finding Topics in Collections of Documents: A Shared Nearest Neighbor Approach, pp. 84-90. , Kluwer Academic Publishers Boston; Steinbach, M., Tan, P., Kumar, V., (2003) Discovery of Climate Indices Using Clustering, pp. 446-455. , ACM Press New York; Steinbach, M., Tan, P., Kumar, V., (2002) Temporal Data Mining for the Discovery and Analysis of Ocean Climate Indices, pp. 1-10. , ACM Press New York; Tan, P., Steinbach, M., Kumar, V., (2001) Finding Spatio-Temporal Patterns in Earth Science Data, pp. 1-12. , ACM Press New York; Su, F., Zhou, C., Lyne, V., A data-mining approach to determine the spatio-temporal relationship between environmental factors and fish distribution (2004) Ecol Model, 174, pp. 421-431; Harms, S.K., Deogun, J.S., Tadesse, T., (2002) Discovering Sequential Association Rules with Constraints and Time Lags in Multiple Sequences, pp. 432-442. , Springer Berlin; Mannila, H., Toivonen, H., (1996) Discovering Generalized Episodes Using Minimal Occurrences, pp. 146-151. , ACM Press New York; Harms, S.K., Deogun, J.S., (2004) Sequential Association Rule Mining with Time Lags, pp. 7-22. , Springer Berlin; Xue, J.B., Zhong, W., Relationship between the droughts, floods and climatic changes in Guangdong during the history period (2005) Geo Geo-Info Sci (In Chinese), 5, pp. 75-79; Oldenborgh, G.J., Burgers, G., Tank, A.K., On the El-Nino teleconnection to spring precipitation in Europe (2000) Int J Clim, 20, pp. 565-574; Liu, Q., Liu, Z.Y., Pan, A.J., Conceptual model about the interaction between El Niño/Southern Oscillation and Quasi-Biennial Oscillation in far west equatorial Pacific (2006) Sci China ser D-Earth Sci, 49, pp. 889-896. , 8","Song, G.; Department of Machine Intelligence, Peking University, Ministry of Education, Beijing 100871, China; email: gjsong@pku.edu.cn",,,,,,,,10069321,,SCETF,,"English","Sci China Ser E Technol Sci",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-44949125774

We live in an era of an unprecedented data volume from diverse sources, multidisciplinary analysis and synthesis, and active, learner-centered education emphasis. Complex environmental problems such as global change and water cycle transcend disciplinary and geographic boundaries, and their solution requires integrated earth system science approaches. Contemporary education strategies recommend adopting an Earth system science approach for teaching the geosciences, employing pedagogical techniques such as enquiry-based learning. The resulting transformation in geoscience education and research creates new opportunities for advancement and poses many challenges. The success of the scientific enterprise depends heavily on the availability of a state-of-the-art, robust, and flexible cyberinfrastructure, and on the timely access to quality data, products, and tools to process, manage, analyze, integrate, publish, and visualize those data. Concomittantly, rapid advances in computing, communication, and information technologies have revolutionized the provision and use of data, tools and services. The profound consequences of Moore's Law and the explosive growth of the Internet are well known. On the other hand, how other technological trends have shaped the development of data services is less well understood. For example, the advent of digital libraries, web services, open standards and protocols have been important factors in shaping a new generation of cyberinfrastructure for solving key scientific and educational problems.

Radiance data from the satellite-borne Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer instrument provide an opportunity for a virtual archive at the Goddard Earth Sciences Distributed Active Archive Center (GES DAAC): The raw data are only one-fourth the size of the derived radiances.

Instead, multivariate Poisson data are commonly approximated by either univariate Poisson or multivariate Normal data. However, these approximations are often not adequate in practice. In this paper, we propose a conceptually appealing correction for NORTA (NORmal To Anything) for generating multivariate Poisson data with a flexible correlation structure and rates. NORTA is based on simulating data from a multivariate Normal distribution and converting it into an arbitrary continuous distribution with a specific correlation matrix. We show that our method is both highly accurate and computationally efficient.

In order to achieve this aim, a ""Computer Self-efficiency Scale"" used in educational sciences was selected and this scale was applied in a study group. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics (t-test and analysis of variance), and the data mining techniques of decision tree, dependency networks and clustering. The descriptive statistics used were calculated not using common statistical software packages, but by running a program written in Delphi 2009 programming language on Microsoft SQL Server 2008. Microsoft SQL Server 2008 was directly used for the data mining techniques of dependency networks and clustering. Some of the findings of the research, which cannot be obtained by common statistical techniques but can be obtained by data mining methods, were as follows: ""those who think they are competent with computer terms and concepts believe they have a special talent in using computers""; ""those who believe they have a special talent in using computers feel as if the computer is part of their body"", and ""students who have been using computers for more than six years believe they have a special talent in using computers"". © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Data mining; Educational sciences",,,,,,,"Akpinar, H., Veri tabanlarinda bilgi kesfi ve veri madenciligi (2000) I.U.

The second phase the system will automatically crawl new publications from online digital libraries such as Microsoft Academic Search, ACM, IEEEXplore, CiteSeer and extract bibliographical information (one kind of publication metadata) to update, enrich the existing database, which have been built at the first phase. This system serves effectively in services relating to academic activities such as searching literatures, ranking publications, ranking experts, ranking conferences or journals, reviewing articles, identifying the research trends, mining the linking of articles, stating of the art for a specified research domain, and other related works base on these bibliographical data. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","bibliographical data; data integration; Digital library; focused crawler","Academic activities; Academic search; Bibliographic data; bibliographical data; CiteSeer; data integration; Focused crawler; Focused crawling; MicroSoft; Online sources; Research domains; Research trends; Second phase; Computer science; Digital libraries; Metadata; Publishing; Search engines",,,,,,"Abbasi, A., Altmann, J., A social network system for analyzing publication activities of researchers (2010) TEMEP Discussion Papers 201058, , Seoul National University; Technology Management, Economics, and Policy Program, TEMEP; Bainbridge, D., Thompson, J., Witten, I.H., Assembling and enriching digital library collections (2003) Proceedings of the 3rd ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital Libraries, JCDL 2003, pp. 323-334. , IEEE Computer Society, Washington, DC; Bast, H., Weber, I., The completesearch engine: Interactive, efficient, and towards ir & db integration (2007) CIDR, pp. 88-95; Diederich, J., Balke, W.T., FacetedDBLP - Navigational Access for Digital Libraries (2008) Bulletin of IEEE Technical Committee on Digital Libraries, 4. , ISSN 1937-7266; Garfield, E., Citation indexes for science: A new dimension in documentation through association of ideas (1955) Science, 122 (3159), pp. 108-111; Giles, C.L., Bollacker, K.D., Lawrence, S., Citeseer: An automatic citation indexing system (1998) Proceedings of the Third ACM Conference on Digital Libraries, DL 1998, pp. 89-98. , ACM, New York; Lawrence, S., Giles, C.L., Bollacker, K.D., Autonomous citation matching (1999) Proceedings of the Third Annual Conference on Autonomous Agents, AGENTS 1999, pp. 392-393. , ACM, New York; Ley, M., The DBLP Computer Science Bibliography: Evolution, Research Issues, Perspectives (2002) LNCS, 2476, pp. 1-10. , Laender, A.H.F., Oliveira, A.L.

But conventional virtual organization based access control frameworks are not suitable for self-organizing, ad-hoc and opportunistic scientific collaborations, in which scientists can easily set up group-oriented authorization rules across the administrative domains. Using the emerging OAuth2.0 protocol, this paper introduces a novel Open Social based access control framework to support ad-hoc team formation and user-controlled resource sharing. Our experiences with development of the framework in e-Science data infrastructure projects demonstrate that the proposed framework is a very promising approach to resource sharing in cross-domain e-science environments. ©2012 IEEE.","Access control; e-Science; Open social","Ad-hoc teams; Authorization rules; Computing resource; Cross-domain; Data infrastructure; e-Science; Group-oriented; Open social; Resource sharing; Scientific collaboration; Self organizing; Social-based; Virtual organization; Access control; Information management",,,,,,"Pearlman, L., Welch, V., Foster, I., Kesselman, K., Tuecke, S., A community authorization service for group collaboration (2002) Proceedings of IEEE Workshop on Policies for Distributed Systems and Networks, Univ. of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, August; Alfieri, R., Cecchini, R., Ciaschini, V., From gridmap-file to VOMS: Managing authorization in a Grid environment (2005) Future Generation Computer Systems, 5 (21), pp. 549-558; Hasel, M., Opensocial: An enabler for social applications on the web (2011) Communications of the ACM, 54 (1), pp. 139-144; Hammer-Lahav, E., (2010) The OAuth 1.0 Protocol (RFC 5849), , http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849, Electronic source with authors and publication time.

An a posteriori phylogenetic analysis of the sequences could help to eliminate most of the errors and thus greatly improve data quality. However, previously published caveats and recommendations along these lines were not yet picked up by all researchers. Here we call for stringent quality control of mtDNA data by haplogroup-directed database comparisons. We take some problematic databases of East Asian mtDNAs, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences and Forensic Science International, as examples to demonstrate the process of pinpointing obvious errors. Our results show that data sets are not only notoriously plagued by base shifts and artificial recombination but also by lab-specific phantom mutations, especially in the second hypervariable region (HVR-II). © 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In order to analyze efficiency of our framework in integrating data from heterogeneous sources, we conduct experiment with three different digital libraries: Microsoft Academic Search, CiteSeerX and DBLP. At this time, our integrated dataset contains 5.320.539 publications and 1.723.148 authors and their metadata. Our dataset increases quantity of rows and columns compared with the others.

With the growth in size of such data, integration and search become computational intensive tasks; planning and optimization of the way in which joined combinations are extracted is required to obtain results and get them efficiently. This paper discusses the challenging aspects of querying heterogeneous data sources and efficiently integrating the retrieved results, also effectively taking into account retrieved partial ranked values. The solutions adopted in the new Search Computing (SeCo) infrastructure, more precisely the server-side aspects of the framework, are illustrated in a Life Science scenario, where they allow discovering answers to complex biomedical questions. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Data searches; Heterogeneous data sources; Life-sciences; Multi domains; Search computing; Service Oriented; Search engines",,,,,,"Masseroli, M., Ghisalberti, G., Bio-SeCo: Integration and global ranking of biomedical search results (2011) LNCS, 6585, pp. 203-214. , S.

Fourteen monitoring wells in Kaohsiung Science Park were selected as study case, and lab data of routine groundwater analysis including pH, EC, hardness, TDS, TOC, ammonia, nitrate, nitrite, chloride, sulphate, fluoride, phenols, Fe, Mn, As, and temperature were subjected to principal component and cluster analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) was utilized to reflect those chemical data with the greatest correlation, and PCA results identified five major principal components (PCs) representing 74.6% of cumulative variance. Based on the monitoring data between 2005 and 2008, the extracted information from the PCA mirrored the potential sources of groundwater contamination as acid leakage, arsenic dissolution, salinization, mineralization, and fluoride release. Cluster analysis (CA) was used to evaluate the similarities of water quality in groundwater samples, and five clusters were assigned in two-step clustering for corresponding with the number of PCs, i.e. the potential sources of groundwater contamination. The interpreted facts from CA illustrated that the classified monitoring wells in each cluster properly match up with the identified processes. With the aid of neighbourhood linkage, the domain of groundwater contamination can be spatially outlined by mapping the neighbouring wells within the identical cluster. Therefore, the nature of underlying processes affecting groundwater quality was explored by statistical diagnosis. © 2009 IEEE.","Cluster analysis; Data mining; Groundwater contamination; Principal component analysis; Water quality","Arsenic dissolution; Chemical data; Fluoride release; Groundwater analysis; Groundwater contamination; Groundwater quality; Major principal component; Monitoring wells; Neighbourhood; Potential sources; Principal Components; Science park; Statistical diagnosis; Statistical tools; Study case; Sulphates; Arsenic; Chlorine compounds; Cluster analysis; Contamination; Data handling; Dissolution; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Information systems; Manganese; Manganese compounds; Parks; Phenols; Quality control; Statistical mechanics; Water quality; Wells; World Wide Web; Principal component analysis",,,,,,"Atkinson, P., (2000) GIS and Geocomputation, , Taylor and Francis; Wu, T.N., Huang, Y.C., Lee, M.S., Kao, C.M., Source identification of groundwater pollution with the aid of multivariate statistical analysis (2005) Water Science & Technology: Water Supply, 5 (6), pp. 281-288; Huang, Y.C., Wu, T.N., Cheng, P.J., Characterization of groundwater quality by multivariate statistical analysis: An example from Kaohsiung County, Taiwan (2005) Water and Environment Management Series, pp. 39-49. , Water and Wastewater Management for Developing Countries, K.

They have lived up to this promise. New cabled observatories have sometimes in excess of 100 different instruments semipermanently installed in areas of scientific interest. The instruments represent hundreds of different variables measured at a high frequency (often once per second or more) on a 24/7/365 basis, thereby generating large data volumes that accumulate in archives. Not only are we talking about large data volumes, we are also facing many different data types as instruments are often preprocessing data and assembling them in complex data structures or matrices. For practical purposes, three major data types can be described based on the duty cycles of the instruments producing them: • scalar data coming from single point measurement sensors on a periodic basis with a sampling frequency < 10Hz; • complex data structures, often produced by active acoustic instruments such as ADCPs and current profilers that produce multi-dimensional matrices typically at a rate ≤ 1 Hz • streams that are produced by passive sensors, continuously sampling their environments at high frequencies (≥ ∼20Hz) such as cameras and hydrophones, seismometers, etc. The complexity also resides in that many of the instruments are in some way mapping their wider environment and not just their immediate vicinity. Therefore the matrices they sent back represent their own specific encoding of spatial data. Examples here include ADCPs, sonars, but also vehicles moving in one, two or three dimensions (vertical profiler, crawlers, gliders, AUVs, etc.) The instruments and sensors are often of a legacy type, from different vendors, with proprietary formats and usually are not optimized to work in connected, powered environment. The stated goal of the observatories is to enable not only science in a particular discipline, but to foster multi-disciplinary experiments, to support real-time science as well as to provide a longitudinal view on the evolutions of the oceans. The above considerations represent significant challenges not only for the scientists, but also for data providers as they need to be in a position to support: • many different science disciplines • scientists not used to dealing with vast amounts of data • scientists not necessarily used to data from instrumentation they are not always familiar with • users still expecting to be able to just 'download a couple of years of data' At Ocean Networks Canada, those challenges have been addressed in a number of ways, oftentimes creative and sometimes disruptive. With the support of CANARIE, Canada's advanced research and innovation network, we have adopted the Web 2.0 concepts of participation and contribution. Those two concepts are very powerful and are at the origin of wikipedia, FaceBook, Twitter and, to some extent, massively parallel computer games: they allow individuals to 10.1109/OCEANS.2012.6404783contribute/share content and to participate in groups of like-minded citizens in activities around a specific topic or theme for a period of time. In this contribution, we are describing the innovations that are now available to users of the NEPTUNE Canada cabled network access interfaces and how they contribute to address many of the challenges that scientists face in dealing with those first Big Science infrastructures for the study of the oceans. They include a data visualization utility that allows plots created to be posted and shared with other users, a data search tool that offers a multitude of data formatting and averaging/decimation options, a real-time camera control interface that allows multiple users to simultaneously use the instruments and chat among themselves, regardless of where they are each located on the planet, a tool that encourages users to upload their data processing code rather than download data and share that code with others. Moreover, to help engage the public and address education needs, a citizen science tool called 'Digital Fishers' was developed. It allows users to contribute their time in annotating videos of the deep. Contributed annotations become part of a statistical data base that can be searched for area of interest in the video collections. All those tools, part of the Oceans 2.0 environment, are written for minimal access limitation: they all run on web browsers and require no platform specific application to be installed. © 2012 IEEE.","Crowdsourcing; Data Management; Data Visualization; Interactive Instrument Control; multi-disciplinary science; Ocean Observatory; Web 2.0","Crowdsourcing; Instrument control; Multi-disciplinary; Ocean observatories; Web 2.0; Buildings; Cables; Cameras; Data structures; Data visualization; Information management; Innovation; Instruments; Observatories; Oceanography; Sensors; Social networking (online); World Wide Web; Matrix algebra",,,,,,"Radziwill, N.M., Foundations for quality management of scientific data products (2006) ASQ; Pirenne, B., Choosing the right tools for an archive (1993) Handling and Archiving Data from Ground-based Telescopes: ESO Conference and Workshop Proceedings, Proceedings of the ESO-OAT, 1994, p. 43. , (Osservatorio Astronomico Trieste, Italy) International Workshop held in Trieste, Italy, April 21-23.

The system's original design assumed that all science data archive, processing and dissemination would be done using high performance subsystems with complex distributed object interfaces between them. These interfaces made it difficult for others to extend the system without incurring the prohibitively high costs of supporting this infrastructure. Over the past three years, most of these interfaces have been replaced with greatly simplified script and file-based interfaces. NASA also has encouraged science and Data Center groups to modify and extend the system's core functionality. As these extensions began to emerge, it was apparent that new configuration management and system deployment methods would be needed to leverage each group's extensions across the ECS Data Centers. NASA has adapted several Open Source development techniques to address this need. This paper will describe how the ECS architecture and supporting development methods have evolved to support Open Source development concepts while at the same time satisfying ECS's challenging requirements. It also will describe how these changes have helped lower the system's overall costs and decrease the time it takes for new capabilities to become operational. We plan to build on the success of these initial changes to encourage additional EOSDIS user participation through many new roles: client and portal providers, data providers, algorithm providers, data processing centers, data service providers, distribution centers and data managers.","Open source; Science data management systems; Software engineering","Algorithms; Client server computer systems; Data acquisition; Data communication systems; Data handling; Database systems; Gateways (computer networks); Interfaces (computer); Portals; Software engineering; Space flight; Data archive; Data dissemination; Earth observing system data and information system; Science data management systems; Software package Open Source; Earth sciences",,,,,,"http://www.opengis.org/, Open GIS ConsortiumRaymond, E., (1999) The Cathedral & the Bazaar Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary, , O'Reilly and Associates.

NPOESS is a joint mission of three federal agencies, NASA, NOAA, and DoD. NASA's primary science role in NPP is to independently assess the quality of the NPP science and environmental data records for climate research. Such assessment is critical for making NPOESS products the best that they can be for operational use and ultimately for climate studies. The Science Data Segment (SDS) supports science assessment by assuring the timely provision of NPP data to NASA's science teams organized by climate measurement themes. The SDS breaks down into nine major elements, an input element that receives data from the operational agencies and acts as a buffer, a calibration analysis element, Ave elements devoted to measurement based quality assessment, an element used to test algorithmic improvements, and an element that provides overall science direction. This paper will describe how the NPP SDS will leverage on NASA experience to provide a mission-reliable research capability for science assessment of NPP derived measurements.","Climate studies; DoD; Environmental data records; Leverage off existing science systems; NASA; National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System(NPOESS); NOAA; NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP) science data segment; Qualify assessment","Climate change; Meteorology; NASA; Remote sensing; Risk management; Signal receivers; DoD; Environmental data records; Leverage off existing science systems; National Polar orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System(NPOESS); NOAA; NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP) science data segment; Qualify assessment; Satellite imagery",,,,,,"(2003) Research Announcement, NPP Science Team for Climate Data, , NRA-03 -OES-0l, Records, January 28; Asrar, Ghassem, Level, I., (2003) Requirements for the NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP), , Signed November 3; Tilmes, C., Linda, M., Fleig, A., Development of two Science Investigator-led Processing Systems (SIPS) for NASA's Earth Observation System (EOS) (2004) IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society; Krimchansky, S., Performance for First Flight Unit of the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) (2005) Proc. of SPIE, 5979, p. 597926. , doi: 10.1117/12.632429; Data and Information Service (NESDIS), National Polarorbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS), , http://www.ipo.tioaa.gov, NOAA Satellite and Information Service, National Environmental Satellite, Retrieved April 20, 2006, from; National Environment Satelite, , http://www.osd.noaa.gov/class, NOAA Satellite and Information Service, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) CLASS, Retrieved April 20, 2006, from","Schweiss, R.J.; NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Code 429, Greenbelt, MD, United States; email: robert.i.schweiss@nasa.gov",,"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society;Canadian Remote Sensing Society;National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration;Office of Naval Research",,"2006 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, IGARSS","31 July 2006 through 4 August 2006","Denver, CO",70348,,0780395107; 9780780395107,IGRSE,,"English","Dig Int Geosci Remote Sens Symp (IGARSS)",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-34948879042

Yet this represents a small fraction of the total number of publicly available data sources on the Web. We briefly describe past attempts to transform specific Life Science sources from a plethora of open as well as proprietary formats into RDF data. In particular, we identify and tackle two bottlenecks in current practice: Acquiring ontologies to formally describe these data and creating ""RDFizer"" programs to convert data from legacy formats into RDF. We propose an unsupervised method, based on transformation rules, for performing these two key tasks, which makes use of our previous work on unsupervised wrapper induction for extracting labelled data from complete Life Science Web sites. We apply our approach to 13 real-world online Life Science databases. The learned ontologies are evaluated by domain experts as well as against gold standard ontologies. Furthermore, we compare the learned ontologies against ontologies that are ""lifted"" directly from the underlying relational schema using an existing unsupervised approach. Finally, we apply our approach to three online databases to extract RDF data. Our results indicate that this approach can be used to bootstrap and speed up the migration of life science data into the Linked Open Data cloud. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",,"Current practices; Data clouds; Data sets; Data source; Domain experts; Gold standards; Life-sciences; Online database; RDF data; Real-world; Relational schemas; Speed-ups; Transformation rules; Unsupervised approaches; Unsupervised method; Wrapper induction; Ontology; Semantic Web; Semantics; Wavelet transforms; World Wide Web; Metadata",,,,,,"Galperin, M.Y., Cochrane, G.R., Nucleic Acids Research annual Database Issue and the NAR online Molecular Biology Database Collection in 2009 (2009) Nucleic Acids Res., 37 (DATABASE ISSUE), pp. 1-4; Cheung, K.H., YeastHub: A semantic web use case for integrating data in the life sciences domain (2005) Bioinformatics, 21 (SUPPL. 1). , June 1; Baker, C.J.O., Semantic Web infrastructure for fungal enzyme biotechnologists (2006) Journal of Web Semantics, 3 (4); Stephens, S., LaVigna, D., Dilascio, M., Luciano, J., Aggregation of bioinformatics data using semantic web technology (2006) Journal of Web Semantics, p. 4; Pasquier, C., Biological data integration using Semantic Web technologies (2008) Biochimie, 90 (4), pp. 584-594; Zhao, J., Miles, A., Klyne, G., Shotton, D., OpenFlyData: The Way to Go for Biological Data Integration (2009) LNCS (LNBI), 5647, pp. 47-54. , Paton, N.W., Missier, P., Hedeler, C.

To unlock this data it is important to gain the trust of the companies that hold the data as well as showing them how they may benefit from this research. Part of this trust is gained through established reputation and the other through the technology used to safeguard the data. This paper discusses how different technology frameworks have been applied to safeguard the data and facilitate collaborative work between commercial concerns and academic institutions. The paper focuses on the distinctive requirements of e-Social Science: access to large-scale data on behaviour in society in environments that impose confidentiality constraints on access. These constraints arise from both privacy concerns and the commercial sensitivities of that data. In particular, the paper draws on the experiences of building an intercontinental Grid-INWA-from its first operation connecting Australia and Scotland to its subsequent extension to China across the Trans-Eurasia Information Network-the first large-scale research and education network for the Asia-Pacific region. This allowed commercial data to be analysed by experts that were geographically distributed across the globe. It also provided an entry point for a major Chinese commercial organisation to approve use of a Grid solution in a new collaboration provided the centre of gravity of the data is retained within the jurisdiction of the data owner. We describe why, despite this approval, an embedded solution was eventually adopted. We find that 'data sovereignty' dominates any decision on whether and how to participate in e-Social Science collaborations and how this might impact on a Cloud based solution to this type of collaboration. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Cloud; Data sovereignty; Grid; Social Science","Academic institutions; Academic research; Asia Pacific region; Australia; Centre of gravity; Collaborative Work; Data sovereignty; Digital datas; e-Social science; Entry point; Grid; Large-scale research; Privacy concerns; Scotland; Clouds; Information services; Research; Social sciences",,,,,,"Granger, C.W.J., (2004) Some Aspects of the Future of Forecasting, Keynote, In: 24th International Symposium on Forecasting, , http://forecasters.org/isf/pdfs/ISF2004_program.pdf, Sydney, July (accessed 13.07.12); Halfpenny, P., Procter, R., The e-social science research agenda (2010) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, Series A, 368, pp. 3761-3778. , 10.1098/rsta.2010.0154; Savage, M., Burrows, R., The coming crisis of empirical sociology (2007) Sociology, 41, pp. 885-899. , 10.1177/0038038507080443; Sloan, T.M., Carter, A., Graham, P.J., Unwin, D., Gregory, I., First data investigation on the Grid: FirstDIG (2003) Proceedings of the 2nd UK E-Science All Hands Meeting, pp. 287-289. , S.

Considering the involved enormous and exponentially growing data volumes, centralized data management reaches its limits. Since scientific data are often highly skewed and exploration tasks exhibit a large degree of spatial locality, we propose the locality-aware allocation of data objects onto a distributed network of interoperating databases. HiSbase is an approach to data management in scientific federated Data Grids that addresses the scalability issue by combining established techniques of database research in the field of spatial data structures (quadtrees), histograms, and parallel databases with the scalable resource sharing and load balancing capabilities of decentralized Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks. The proposed combination constitutes a complementary e-science infrastructure enabling load balancing and increased query throughput. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Stork focuses on planning, scheduling, monitoring and management of data placement tasks and application-level end-to-end optimization of networked inputs/outputs for petascale distributed e-Science applications. Unlike existing approaches, Stork treats data resources and the tasks related to data access and movement as first-class entities just like computational resources and compute tasks, and not simply the side-effect of computation. Stork provides unique features such as aggregation of data transfer jobs considering their source and destination addresses, and an application-level throughput estimation and optimization service. We describe how these two features are implemented in Stork and their effects on end-to-end data transfer performance. © 2011 The Royal Society.","Data-intensive computing; E-Science; Input/output scheduling; Stork; Throughput optimization","Data-intensive computing; e-Science; Input/output scheduling; Stork; Throughput optimization; Data transfer; Optimization; Planning; Scheduling",,,,,,"Hey, T., Trefethen, A., The data deluge: An e-science perspective (2003) Grid Computing-Making The Global Infrastructure a Reality, pp. 809-824. , ch. 36, New York, NY: Wiley and Sons; (2003) Strategic plan for the US Climate Change Science Program, , CCSP., A Report by the Climate Change Science Program and the Subcommittee on Global Change Research.

While citizen science projects can engage a very large number of volunteers to collect volumes of data, they are prone to contain reporting errors. Our experience with eBird, a citizen science project that engages tens of thousands of volunteers to collect bird observations, has shown that a massive effort by volunteer experts is needed to screen data, identify outliers and flag them in the database. But the increasing volume of data being collected by eBird places a huge burden on these volunteer experts. In order to minimize this human effort, we explored whether previously collected eBird data can be used to create automated quality filters that emerge from the data. We do this through a two-step process. First a data-based method detects outliers (i.e., observations that are unusual for a given region and week of the year). Next, a novel machine learning method that estimates observer expertise is used to decide if the unusual observation should be flagged or not. Our preliminary findings indicate that this automated process reliably identifies outliers and accurately classifies them as either an error or represents a potentially valuable observation. © 2011 IEEE.","citizen-science; data quality; data-base filters; machine learning; species occurrence","Automated data; Automated process; citizen-science; data quality; Machine learning methods; Machine-learning; Observer variability; species occurrence; Two-step process; Automation; Statistics; Learning systems",,,,,,"Bonney, R., Cooper, C., Dickinson, J., Kelling, S., Phillips, T., Rosenberg, K., Shirk, J., Citizen Science: A Developing Tool for Expanding Science Knowledge and Scientific Literacy (2009) BioScience, 59, pp. 977-984; Dickenson, J.L., Zuckerberg, B., Bonter, D.N., (2010) Citizen Science As An Ecological Research Tool: Challenges and Benefits, 41. , Palo Alto, CA, ETATS-UNIS: Annual Reviews; Trumbull, D.J., Bonney, R., Bascom, D., Cabral, A., Thinking scientifically during participation in a citizen-science project (2000) Science Education, 84, pp. 265-275; Sullivan, B.L., Wood, C.L., Iliff, M.J., Bonney, R.E., Fink, D., Kelling, S., EBird: A citizen-based bird observation network in the biological sciences (2009) Biological Conservation, 142, pp. 2282-2292; Caruana, R., Elhawary, M., Munson, A., Riedewald, M., Sorokina, D., Fink, D., Hochachka, W., Kelling, S., Mining Citizen Science Data to Predict Prevalence of Wild Bird Species (2006) Proc.

Today, a movement is afoot within the scientific computing community to shift ""collaboratory"" development from traditional tool-centric approaches to more data-centric ones. Yet, to effectively support data sharing means more than providing a common repository for storing and retrieving shared data sets. In order to reasonably comprehend and apply another researcher's data set, the scientist must grasp the various contexts of the data as it relates to the overall data space, applications, experiments, projects, and the scientific community. Under development at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, the Biological Sciences Collaboratory (BSC) enables the sharing of biological data and analyses through diverse capabilities such as metadata capture, electronic laboratory notebooks, data organization views, data provenance tracking, analysis notes, task management, and scientific workflow management. Overall, BSC strives to identify and capture the various social and scientific contexts in which data sharing collaborations in biology take place and to provide collaboration tools and capabilities that can effectively support and facilitate these important data sharing contexts.","Collaboratory; Data provenance; Data sharing; Data sharing contexts; Data-centric collaboration; Metadata; Scientific workflow; Tool-centric collaboration","Biomedical engineering; Data reduction; Metadata; Natural sciences computing; Social aspects; World Wide Web; Biological data; Data provenance; Data sets; Data sharing contexts; Data-centric collaboration; Scientific workflow; Tool-centric collaboration; Computer supported cooperative work",,,,,,"Jetspeed, , http://jakarta.apache.org/jetspeed/site/index.html; The Jakarta Slide Project, , http://jakarta.apache.org/slide; Arzberger, P., Finhold, T.A., Data and collaboratories in the biomedical community (2002) National Biomedical Computation Resource at the University of California, San Diego, , NTH award RR08605; Bhandarkar, M., Budescu, G., Humphrey, W.F., Izaguirre, J.A., Izrailev, S., Kalé, L.V., Kosztin, D., Schulten, K., BioCoRE: A collaboratory for structural biology (1999) Proceedings of the SCS International Conference on Web-based Modeling and Simulation, pp. 242-251. , San Francisco, CA; Birnholtz, J.P., Bietz, M.J., Data at work: Supporting sharing in science and engineering (2003) Proceedings of the 2003 International ACM SIGGROUP Conference on Supporting Group Work, pp. 339-348. , Sanibel Island, FL; Bourne, P.E., Gribskov, M., Johnson, G., Moreland, J., Weissig, H., A prototype molecular interactive collaborative environment (MICE) (1998) Proceeding of the 1998 Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing, pp. 118-129. , Kapalua, HI; Brazma, A., Hingamp, P., Quackenbush, J., Sherlock, G., Spellman, P., Stoeckert, C., Aach, J., Vingron, M., Minimum information about a microarray experiment (MIAME)-toward standards for microarray data (2001) Natural Genetics, 29 (4), pp. 365-371; Brazma, A., Parkinson, H., Sarkans, U., Shojatalab, M., Vilo, J., Abeygunawardena, N., Holloway, E., Sansone, S.A., Arrayexpress-A public repository for microarray gene expression data at the EBI (2003) Nucleic Acids Research, 31 (1), pp. 68-71; Edgar, R., Domrachev, M., Lash, A.E., Gene expression omnibus: NCBI gene expression and hybridization array data repository (2002) Nucleic Acids Research, 30 (1), pp. 207-210; Lotus Instant Messaging (Sometime), , http://www.lotus.com/products/lotussametime.nsf/wdocs/homepage; Louis, K.S., Jones, L.M., Campbell, E.G., Sharing in science (2002) American Scientist, 90 (4), pp. 304-307; Kellogg, W.A., Qualitative artifact analysis (1990) Proceedings of INTERACT 90, pp. 193-198. , Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Macedonia, M.R., Brutzman, D.P., MBone provides audio and video across the internet IEEE Computer, 27 (4), pp. 30-36; Mangalam, H., Stewart, J., Zhou, J., Schlauch, K., Waugh, M., Chen, G., Farmer, A.D., Weller, J.W., GeneX: An open source gene expression database and integrated tool set (2001) IBM Systems Journal, 40 (2), pp. 552-569; Merton, R.K., (1968) Social Theory and Social Structure, , Free Press, New York; MGED - International Meetings on Microarray Gene Expression Databases Group, , http://www.mged.org/index.html; NetMeeting, , http://www.microsoft.com/windows/netmeeting/default.asp; Shewanella Federation, , http://www.shewanella.org/home.sjsp; Myers, J.D., Allison, T.C., Bittner, S., Didier, B., Frenklach, M., Green, W.H., Ho, Y., Yang, C., A collaborative informatics infrastructure for multi-scale science (2004) Proceedings of the Challenges of Large Applications in Distributed Environments (CLADE) Workshop, , Honolulu, HI; Myers, J.D., Chappell, A.R., Elder, M., Geist, A., Schwidder, J., Re-integrating the research record (2003) Computing in Science and Engineering, pp. 44-50. , May/June; Olson, G.M., Finholt, T.A., Teasley, S.D., Behavioral aspects of collaboratories (2000) Electronic Collaboration in Science, , Koslow, S.H. and Huerta, M.F.

With this Grid based infrastructure that provides for using and managing widely distributed computing and data resources in the science environment, there is now an opportunity to provide a standard, large-scale, computing, data, instrument, and collaboration environment for science that spans many different projects, institutions, and countries. We argue that Grid technology provides an excellent basis for the creation of the integrated environments that can combine the resources needed to support the large-scale science projects located at multiple laboratories and universities. We also present some science case studies that indicate that a paradigm shift in the process of science will come about as a result of Grids providing transparent and secure access to advanced and integrated information and technologies infrastructure: powerful computing systems, large-scale data archives, scientific instruments, and collaboration tools. These changes will be in the form of Grid based services that can be integrated with the user's work environment, and that enable uniform and highly capable access to these computers, data, and instruments, regardless of the location or exact nature of these resources. These services will integrate transient-use resources like computing systems, scientific instruments, and data caches (e.g., as they are needed to perform a simulation or analyze data from a single experiment); persistent-use resources, such as databases, data catalogues, and archives; and collaborators, whose involvement will continue for the lifetime of a project or longer. While we largely address large-scale science requirements in this paper, Grids, particularly when combined with Web Services, will address a broad spectrum of science scenarios, both large and small scale, as well as various commercial and cultural cyberinfrastructure applications.","Computing and Data Grids; Distributed computing; Distributed science applications",,,,,,,"Johnston, W., (2002) Computational and Data Grids in Large-Scale Science and Engineering.

While powerful and sophisticated image processing software tools are available to prepare and analyze the data, these tools are complex and cumbersome, requiring significant expertise to properly operate. Thus, in order to extract (e.g., mine or analyze) useful information from the data, a user (in our case a scientist) often must possess both significant science and image processing expertise. This article describes the use of artificial intelligence (AI) planning techniques to represent scientific, image processing and software tool knowledge to automate knowledge discovery and data mining (e.g., science data analysis) of large image databases. In particular, we describe two fielded systems. The Multimission VICAR Planner (MVP) which has been deployed for since 1995 and is currently supporting science product generation for the Galileo mission. MVP has reduced time to fill certain classes of requests from 4 h to 15 min. The Automated SAR Image Processing system (ASIP) was deployed at the Department of Geology at Arizona State University in 1997 to support aeolian science analysis of synthetic aperture radar images. ASIP reduces the number of manual inputs in science product generation by ten-fold. © 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.","Planning; Reconfiguration of software modules; Science data analysis","Arizona state university; Artificial intelligence planning; Image-processing software; Knowledge discovery and data minings; Large image database; SAR image processing; Science data analysis; Software modules; Artificial intelligence; Computer software; Image processing; Planning; Synthetic aperture radar; Data mining",,,,,,"Blumberg, D., Greeley, R., Field studies of aerodynamic roughness length (1993) Journal of Arid Environments, 25, pp. 39-48; Capdevielle, P., Dalle, Image processing chain construction by interactive goal specification (1994) Proceedings of the First IEEE International Conference on Image Processing, 3, pp. 816-819. , Austin, TX; Chapman, D., Planning for conjunctive goals (1987) Artificial Intelligence, 32, p. 3; Charlebois, D., Deguise, J., Goodenough, G., Matwin, S., Robson, M., A case-based planner to automate reuse of ES software for analysis of remote sensing data (1991) International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS), 3, pp. 1851-1854; Chien, S.A., Mortensen, H.B., Automating image Processing for scientific data analysis of a large image database (1996) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 18 (8), pp. 854-859; Chien, S., Decoste, D., Doyle, R., Stolorz, P., Making an impact: Artificial intelligence at the jet propulsion laboratory (1997) AI Magazine, 18 (1), pp. 103-122; Chien, S., Govindjee, A., Estlin, T., Wang, X., Griesel, A., Hill Jr., R., Automated generation of tracking plans for a network of communications antennas (1997) The Proceedings of the, , IEEE Aerospace Conference, Aspen, CO, February 1997; Chien, S., Muscettola, N., Rajan, K., Smith, B., Rabideau, G., Automated planning and scheduling for goal-based autonomous spacecraft (1998) IEEE Intelligent Systems, pp. 50-55. , September/October; Chien, S., Fisher, F., Mortensen, H., Lo, E., Greeley, R., Govindjee, A., Estlin, T., Wang, X., Using artificial intelligence planning techniques to automatically reconfigure software modules (1998) II Th International Conference on Industrial and Engineering Application of Artificial Intelligence and Expert Systems, , Castellon Spain June; Clement, V., Thonnat, M., A knowledge-based approach to integration of image processing procedures (1993) Image Understanding, 57, pp. 166-184; Eral, K., Hendler, J., Nau, D., UMCP: A sound and complete procedure for hierarchical task network planning (1994) Proceedings of the Second International Conference on AI Planning Systems, pp. 249-254. , Chicago, IL June; Fayyad, U., Piatetsky-Shapiro, G., Smyth, P., From data mining to knowledge discovery in databases (1996) AI Magazine, 17 (3), pp. 37-54; Fisher, F., Lo, E., Chienr.

Metadata describing the data products used in and generated by these applications is essential to disambiguate the data and enable reuse. Data provenance, one kind of metadata, pertains to the derivation history of a data product starting from its original sources. In this paper we create a taxonomy of data provenance characteristics and apply it to current research efforts in e-science, focusing primarily on scientific workflow approaches. The main aspect of our taxonomy categorizes provenance systems based on why they record provenance, what they describe, how they represent and store provenance, and ways to disseminate it.

With nearly 40. years of continuous observation - since launch of the first satellite in 1972 - the Landsat program has benefited from insightful technical specification, robust engineering, and the necessary infrastructure for data archive and dissemination. Chiefly, the spatial and spectral resolutions have proven of broad utility and have remained largely stable over the life of the program. The foresighted acquisition and maintenance of a global image archive has proven to be of unmatched value, providing a window into the past and fueling the monitoring and modeling of global land cover and ecological change. In this paper we discuss the evolution of the Landsat program as a global monitoring mission, highlighting in particular the recent change to an open (free) data policy. The new data policy is revolutionizing the use of Landsat data, spurring the creation of robust standard products and new science and applications approaches. Open data access also promotes increased international collaboration to meet the Earth observing needs of the 21st century. © 2012.","Applications; Archive; Landsat; Mapping; Monitoring; Policy; Science","Archive; Continuous observation; Data access; Data archives; Earth observation satellites; Earth observing; Ecological changes; Global monitoring; Image archives; International collaborations; Land cover; LANDSAT; New science; Robust engineering; Science; Standard products; Technical specifications; Applications; Mapping; Monitoring; Public policy; Remote sensing; Soils; International cooperation; data acquisition; data management; ecosystem dynamics; engineering; environmental modeling; environmental monitoring; international cooperation; land cover; Landsat; policy approach; research program; satellite imagery; science and technology; spatial resolution",,,,,,"Almeida-Filho, R., Shimabukuro, Y.E., Digital processing of a Landsat-TM time series for mapping and monitoring degraded areas caused by independent gold miners, Roraima State, Brazilian Amazon (2002) Remote Sensing of Environment, 79, pp. 42-50; Arvidson, T., Goward, S.N., Gasch, J., Williams, D., Landsat-7 long-term acquisition plan: Development and validation (2006) Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing, 72 (10), pp. 1137-1146. , doi: 0099-1112/06/7210-1137; Beaubien, J., Visual interpretation of vegetation through digitally enhanced Landsat MSS images (1986) Remote Sensing Reviews, 2, pp. 11-43; Beck, R.N., Gessler, P.E., Development of a Landsat time series for application in forest status assessment in the Inland Northwest United States (2008) Western Journal of Applied Forestry, 23 (1), pp. 53-62; Brinkmann, K., Dickhoefer, U., Schlecht, E., Buerkert, A., Quantification of aboveground rangeland productivity and anthropogenic degradation on the Arabian Peninsula using Landsat imagery and field inventory data (2011) Remote Sensing of Environment, 115, pp. 465-474; Bustamante, J., Pacios, F., Díaz-Delgado, R., Aragonés, D., Predictive models of turbidity and water depth in the Doñana marshes using Landsat TM and ETM+ images (2009) Remote Sensing of Environment, 90, pp. 2219-2225; Cohen, W.B., Spies, T.A., Alig, R.J., Oetter, D.R., Maiersperger, T.K., Fiorella, M., Characterizing 23 years (1972-1995) of stand replacement disturbance in western Oregon forests with Landsat imagery (2002) Ecosystems, 5, pp. 122-137; Cohen, W.B., Goward, S.N., Landsat's role in ecological applications of remote sensing (2004) BioScience, 54 (6), pp. 535-545; Coops, N.C., Gillanders, S.N., Wulder, M.A., Gergel, S.E., Nelson, T., Goodwin, N.R., Assessing changes in forest fragmentation following infestation using time series Landsat imagery (2010) Forest Ecology and Management, 259, pp. 2355-2365; deSelding, P.B., (2010) European officials embrace open data policy for GMES Satellites.

NPOESS is a joint mission of three federal agencies: NASA, NOAA, and DoD. NASA Science Data Segment's (SDS) primary role in NPP is to independently assess the quality of the NPP science and environmental data records for climate research. Such assessment is critical for making NPOESS products the best that they can be for operational use and ultimately for climate studies. The SDS supports science assessment by assuring the timely provision of NPP data to NASA's science teams organized by climate measurement themes. The SDS breaks down into ten major elements: an input element that receives data from the operational agencies and acts as a buffer, a calibration analysis element, five elements devoted to measurement based quality assessment, one Production Element for Earth Radiation, an element used to test algorithmic improvements, and an element that coordinates overall science direction and results. This paper describes how the NPP SDS leveraged existing systems, the final system architectures, and lessons learned for the development of mission-reliable researchready systems capable of supporting the assessment of NPP derived products. © 2008 IEEE.",,"Climate measurements; Climate research; Climate studies; Derived products; Earth radiation; Environmental conditions; Environmental data records; Existing systems; Federal agency; Global climate changes; Lessons learned; Low earth orbiting satellites; Major elements; Measurement-based; National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System; Npoess preparatory projects; Operational use; Quality assessment; Risk reductions; Science-data; Scientific community; System architectures; Climate change; Communication satellites; NASA; Ocean engineering; Oceanography; Ozone; Remote sensing; Satellite communication systems; Space flight; Weather satellites; Diffusers (optical)",,,,,,"NRA-03-OES-01, Research Announcement, NPP Science Team for Climate Data Records, January 28, 2003Tilmes, C., Linda, M., Fleig, A., Development of two Science Investigator-led Processing Systems (SIPS) for NASA's Earth Observation System (EOS) (2004) IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society; Krimchansky, S., Performance for First Flight Unit of the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) (2005) Proc. of SPIE, 5979, p. 597926. , doi: 10.1117/12.632429; Data and Information Service (NESDIS), National Polarorbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS), , http://www.ipo.noaa.gov, NOAA Satellite and Information Service, National Environmental Satellite, Retrieved April 20, 2006, from; Wielicki, B.A., Barkstrom, B.R., Harrison, E.F., Lee III, R.B., Smith, G.L., Cooper, J.E., Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES): An Earth Observing System Experiment (1996) Bull.

One of these Data Systems Working Groups is called the Standards Process Group (SPG). This group's goal is to facilitate broader use of standards that have proven implementation and operational benefit to NASA Earth science. The process is fundamentally different from past standards strategies in several ways. The focus on communities of practice to propose and comment is a key component. So too, is the emphasis on endorsement of demonstrated practices as an additional source of common practices apart from the traditional standards making bodies. Only after practices have been judged to have useful implementation and beneficial operation will they be endorsed. The Standards Process Group has already conducted a community review of the DAP 2.0 as a data transport mechanism and has served as a facilitator for the initiation of science content discussions in several fields.

Especially over the last decade, the volume and variety of data useful for Earth system science have increased quite rapidly. One of the key purposes of collecting these data and generating useful digital products containing derived geophysical parameters is to study the long-term trends in the Earth's behavior. Long-term observational data and derived products are essential for validating results from models that predict the future behavior of the Earth system. Given the significant resources expended in gathering the observational data and developing the derived products, it is important to preserve them for the benefit of future generations of users. Preservation involves maintaining the bits with no loss (or loss within scientifically acceptable bounds) as they move across systems as well as over time, ensuring readability over time, and providing for long-term understandability and repeatability of previously obtained results. In order to ensure long-term understandability and repeatability, it is necessary to identify all items of content that must be preserved and plan for such preservation. This paper discusses the need for a standard enumerating and describing such content items and reports on the progress made by NASA and the Federation of Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP Federation) in the U.S. towards such a standard. © 2012 IEEE.","Data Preservation; Earth System Science; Long-Term Archives; Remote Sensing; Standards","Derived products; Digital products; Earth system science; Earth systems; Future generations; Geophysical parameters; Long-Term Archives; Long-term trend; Observational data; Research and application; Understandability; Geology; NASA; Remote sensing; Standards; Ocean habitats",,,,,,"(2009) Reference Model for An Open Archival Information System (OAIS), , CCSDS, Draft Recommended Standard, CCSDS 650.0-P-1.1 (Pink Book) Issue 1.1 August 2009; (2007) OpenGIS® Sensor Model Language (SensorML) Implementation Specification, , http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sensorml; (1999) Global Change Science Requirements for Long-Term Archiving, Report of the Workshop, , USGCRP, October 28-30, 1998, National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder, CO Sponsored by NASA and NOAA, through the USGCRP Program Office; (2011) Provenance Context Content - 2011-06-08, , http://wiki.esipfed.org/index.php/File:Provenance_Context_Content_2011- 06-08.xls; (2011) NASA ES Data Preservation Content Spec (423-SPEC-001, Nov 2011), , http://earthdata.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/field/document/ NASA_ESD_Preservation_Spec.pdf; Albani, M., Guarino, R., Leone, R., (2011) Long Term Data Preservation Preserved Data Set Composition, (4). , http://earth.esa.int/gscb/ltdp/LTDP_PDSC_3.pdf, Revision 0, May 4","Ramapriyan, H.; NASA Goddard Space Flight CenterUnited States",,"Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society (GRS)",,"2012 32nd IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, IGARSS 2012","22 July 2012 through 27 July 2012","Munich",95192,,,IGRSE,,"English","Dig Int Geosci Remote Sens Symp (IGARSS)",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84873119972

In collaboration with a 6th grade physics instructor and his students, we have developed software tools and curriculum that enable science teachers and students to repurpose gaming technologies to study concepts such as velocity and acceleration. The project involved a year's observation of students' project based learning in a 6th grade physics class, followed by a year of design experimentation to engage students in integrating game controllers into their projects. Using the insights from their observations and suggestions, we created three different Wii Remote-based setups that used the IR camera and the accelerometer to help students glean data from their projects. In this paper, we provide an overview of the project, and then offer data that demonstrates the added value across the material, social, experiential, and temporal aspects of inquiry science activity. We conclude by identifying key design opportunities within this space. © 2012 ACM.","children; data visualization; education; laboratory; physics; science; wii","Added values; children; Cooperative Design; Data acquisitions (DAQ); Game controller; Gaming technology; IR camera; Low costs; Nintendo WII; Project based learning; science; Science activities; Science teachers; Temporal aspects; wii; Accelerometers; Computer supported cooperative work; Curricula; Data visualization; Education; Interactive computer systems; Laboratories; Physics; Students",,,,,,"Barron, B., Learning ecologies for technological fluency: Gender and experience differences (2004) Journal of Educational Computing Research, 31 (1), pp. 1-36. , DOI 10.2190/1N20-VV12-4RB5-33VA; Bransford, J.D., Sherwood, R.D., Hasselbring, T.S., Kinzer, C.K., Williams, S.M., (1990) Anchored Instruction: Why We Need It and How Technology Can Help; Bryant, J.A., Akerman, A., Drell, J., (2008) Wee Wii: Preschoolers and Motion-based Game Play; Clement, J., Using bridging analogies and anchoring intuitions to deal with students' preconceptions in physics (1993) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 30 (10), pp. 1241-1257; De Bruyn, L., Leman, M., Moelants, D., Quantifying children's embodiment of musical rhythm in individual and group settings The 10th International Conference on Music Perception and Cognition, (2008); Dewey, J., (1902) The Child and the Curriculum, , http://books.google.com/books, Retrieved from; Dillenbourg, P., What do you mean by collaborative learning (1999) Collaborative Learning: Cognitive and Computational Approaches, pp. 1-16; Druin, A., Cooperative inquiry: Developing new technologies for children with children (1999) Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems: The CHI Is the Limit, pp. 592-599. , ACM; Ellis, A.K., Fouts, J.T., Research on educational interventions (1997) Eye on Education, pp. 29-34. , Larchmont, NY, USA; Fujimura, J., Crafting science: Standardized packages, boundary objects, and ""translation.""

Manual entry of such information into databases is time consuming, unrewarding, and prone to introducing errors. Taxonomic descriptions of fossils are a good example of valuable data that are overwhelming and available only in printed volumes and journals, some of which are increasingly rare and inaccessible. The highly structured nature of taxonomic procedures and nomenclature means that many previously published data remain equally valid to the present day, and contain information that is currently not available on the World Wide Web; these data would be of great use to a wide variety of scientists and other end users in government, industry, academia and the general public. This paper describes an XML (extensible markup language) parsing technique that allows taxonomic descriptions to be fully digitized much more rapidly than would be possible by manual entry of the data into a database. The technique exploits the high degree of structure in taxonomic descriptions, which are written in a standardized format, to automate the processing of tagging separate sections of the text. Once tagged using XML, the data can be subjected to complex searches using queries written in any of the XML query standards. The XML-tagged data can potentially be imported into existing databases, in effect removing the necessity to manually enter the information, and hence overcoming the main bottleneck in generating digital data from printed material. Individual parsers can be tailored precisely to the nature of the text being analyzed, and once the underlying concepts and procedures are understood, those interested in acquiring and using digital data will be able to generate XML parsers dedicated to text with different styles of standardized formatting. © 2008 Geological Society of America.","Data acquistion; Databased; Geoinformatics; Taxonomy; XML parsing","data acquisition; database; Earth science; nomenclature; taxonomy; World Wide Web",,,,,,"Curry, G.B., Connor, R.J., Automated extraction of biodiversity data from taxonomic descriptions (2007) Biodiversity databases: Techniques, politics, and applications: Systematics Association, 73, pp. 63-81. , Curry, G.B, and Humphries, C.J, eds, Special Boca Raton, Florida, CRC Press, p; Curry, G.B., Connor, R., Simeoni, F., Stratigraphic distribution of brachiopods - A new method of storing and querying biodiversity information (2001) Brachiopods past and present, pp. 424-433. , Brunton, C.H.C, et al, eds, London, Taylor and Francis, p; Davidson, T.D., 1886-1888, A monograph of recent Brachiopoda.

In their senior year, students independently acquire their own data and/or analyze very large, complex and sometimes inter-related data sets.",,"Curricula; Engineering education; Marine biology; Societies and institutions; Students; Data analysis skills; Hypothesis testing problems; Marine science curriculum; Published data sets; Oceanography",,,,,,,"Alfultis, Michael A.; U.S. Coast Guard Acad, New London, United States",,"IEEE;MTS","IEEE, Piscataway, NJ, United States","Oceans 2000","11 September 2000 through 14 September 2000","Providence, RI, USA",57859,01977385,,OCNSD,,"English","Oceans Conf Rec IEEE",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034479364

In essence, in search computing, search services provide ranked answers to requests, and mechanisms are provided for integrating results from multiple searches. This paper presents a case study of the use of a domain independent search computing platform for describing well known bioinformatics resources as search services, and for carrying out integrated analyses over the resulting services. In particular, this makes explicit how ranked data from sequence comparisons and from gene expression results can be integrated in a way that takes account of the ranked results from the different types of data.

Not only does it enhance our understanding of the geological systems, but also enables near-real-time scientific data acquisition and exploration across distant locations. While such a collaborative environment is feasible with advanced optical networks and resource sharing in the form of Grid, many technical challenges remain: (1) on-demand discovery, selection and configuration of supporting end and network resources; (2) construction of applications on heterogeneous, distributed environments; and (3) use of novel exotic transport protocols to achieve high performance. To address these issues, we describe the multi-layered OptIPuter middleware technologies, including simple resource abstractions, dynamic network provisioning, and novel data transport services. In this paper, we present an evaluation of the first integrated prototype of the OptIPuter system software recently demonstrated at iGrid 2005, which successfully supports real-time collaborative visualizations of 3D multi-gigabyte earth science datasets. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This analysis is used to prioritize the data for transmission, so that the data with the highest science value is transmitted to Earth. In addition, the onboard analysis results are used to identify science opportunities. A planning and scheduling component of the system enables the rover to take advantage of the identified science opportunity. OASIS is a NASA-funded research project that is currently being tested on the FIDO rover at JPL for use on future missions. In this paper 1, we provide a brief overview of the OASIS system, and then describe our recent successes in integrating with and using rover hardware. OASIS currently works in a closed loop fashion with onboard control software (e.g., navigation and vision) and has the ability to autonomously perform the following sequence of steps: analyze gray scale images to find rocks, extract the properties of the rocks, identify rocks of interest, retask the rover to take additional imagery of the identified target and then allow the rover to continue on its original mission. We also describe the early 2004 ground test validation of specific OASIS components on selected Mars Exploration Rover (MER) images. These components include the rockfinding algorithm, RockIT, and the rock size feature extraction code. Our team also developed the RockIT GUI, an interface that allows users to easily visualize and modify the rock-finder results. This interface has allowed us to conduct preliminary testing and validation of the rock-finder's performance. © 2005 IEEE.",,"Mars Exploration Rover (MER); Onboard Autonomous Science Investigation System (OASIS); Rockfinding algorithm; Rover hardware; Algorithms; Autonomous agents; Data reduction; Geological surveys; Imaging systems; Palladium; Space research; Navigation systems",,,,,,"Castano, R., Anderson, R., Estlin, T., Decoste, D., Fisher, F., Gaines, D., Mazzoni, D., Judd, M., Rover traverse science for increased mission science return (2003) Proceedings of the 2003 IEEE Aerospace Conference, , Big Sky, Montana, March; Castano, R., Judd, M., Estlin, T., Anderson, R., Scharenbroich, L., Lin, S., Gaines, D., Castano, A., Autonomous onboard traverse science system (2004) Proceedings of the 2004 IEEE Aerospace Conference, , Big Sky, Montana, March; Nesnas, I.A., Wright, A., Bajracharya, M., Simmons, R., Estlin, T., Won, S.K., CLARAty: An architecture for reusable robotic software (2003) SPIE Aerosense Conference, , Orlando, Florida, April; Urmson, C., Simmons, R., Nesnas, I., A generic framework for robotic navigation (2003) Proceedings of the IEEE Aerospace Conference, , Montana, March","Castano, R.; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91109, United States; email: Rebecca.Castano@jpl.nasa.gov",,,,"2005 IEEE Aerospace Conference","5 March 2005 through 12 March 2005","Big Sky, MT",68667,1095323X,0780388704; 9780780388703,,,"English","IEEE Aerosp.

Data characteristics rule out classical time series analysis due to the few time points, and they prevent a simple vectorial treatment due to the high dimensionality. In this contribution, we successfully use the generative topographic mapping through time (GTM-TT) which is based on hidden Markov models enhanced with a topographic mapping to model such data. We propose an extension of GTM-TT by relevance learning which automatically adapts the model such that the most relevant input variables and time points are emphasized by means of an automatic relevance weighting scheme.

The challenge involve how could Unidata best serve the data needs of the education and the research communities. One key goal of the workshop was to raise the level of data awareness within the academic geoscience community. This goal was accomplished through a diverse set of presentations on software, data access/applications, visions of the future, and a student-led poster session.

These applications are among the truly distributed and highly collaborative global systems in existence. Since the resources these applications use are designed to serve individual users, they adopt an all-or-nothing model in which users necessarily have to accept the entire response even though only a fraction of the response is relevant. In computational pipelines involving several databases and complex repeat operations, costs due to unnecessary data transmissions and computations could be significant enough to reduce productivity and make the applications sluggish. Since these resources are autonomous, and do not accept user instructions or queries, users are not able to customize their behavior in order to reduce network latency and wasteful computation or data transmission. Obviously, such a resource utilization and sharing model is wasteful and expensive. In this paper, our goal is to propose a new collaborative data integration and computational pipeline execution model for systems biology research. We show that in our envisioned model, arbitrary sites are able to accept user constraints and limited processing instructions to avoid wasteful computation resulting in improved overall efficiency.

The aim was to use this data to produce development advice maps for use in the planning process. To ensure efficiency of data storage and retrieval, a relational database was used, combined with a geographic information system (GIS), the GIS helping with data collection and data entry. This required the design of a logical model for data storage and manipulation, together with customized database forms for input and reporting. Information was captured in a variety of forms. The resulting comprehensive database was therefore stored in a structured way which has enabled effective interrogation and querying of the data to produce the information around which the final maps can be drawn. -from Authors",,"data management; database; Earth science; environmental geology; mapping; UK, Wales",,,,,,,,"Giles J.R.A.",,"Geological Society, London; Special Publication, 97",,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029526102

Facebook Page Insights data collected from the library's Facebook page were statistically analyzed to investigate patterns of user engagement. The committee hoped to improve posting practices and increase user engagement with the page by studying trends uncovered from data analysis. The results showed that increased posting frequency correlated with more page likes and more user engagement. The type of post content also significantly increased user engagement with the library's Facebook page, with multimedia posts drawing the most interest from fans. Analysis showed that engagement did not significantly decrease during the summer semester compared to the rest of the academic year. Based on these and other findings, the committee created better posting guidelines and will be looking into ways to organize and time posts in order to collect better data and increase Facebook page fans. This article hopes to inform other libraries that are considering creating a Facebook page in two ways: first, by highlighting how Facebook Insights data can be used to capture statistics about user trends; and second, by becoming a basis for best practice posting guidelines in order to have an active, engaging page with fans who remain interested in page content. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","academic libraries; best practices; data analysis; Facebook; health sciences libraries; library 2.0; marketing; online social networks; research; social networking; use studies",,,,,,,"Aharony, N., Facebook Use in Libraries: An Exploratory Analysis (2012) Aslib Proceedings, 64 (4), pp. 358-372. , doi:10.1108/00012531211244725; Bucher, T., Want to be on the Top?

Wilfrid Dixon's 1961 BMD Statistical Program Package was a pioneer predictor of Computing in Statistics, and Arthur Samuel's 1965 presentation on using game-branch probabilities in teaching ILLIAC I to play checkers was a pioneer predictor of Statistics in Computing. Such predictors produced a perception that future interactions of Computing and Statistics might constitute a significant and productive Interface of Computing and Statistics. Another perception included Computing and Statistics with Computing in Statistics and Statistics in Computing. This presented the challenge of organizing an Interface Symposium, to introduce the Interface to a vibrant environment for Computing and Statistics in Southern California. Presentations at the Symposia reveal that small data are in the process of becoming Big Data, while Computing in Statistics and Machine Learning are becoming the Interface, and the Interface is becoming Data Science. Data Science, the first comprehensive Journal on Data Science, another 1 of the 15 ASA Journals as well as 3 of 21 ASA Sections constitute a proud heritage for Interface and its Symposia. Perspective of the article is shaped by 60 years of pioneering and continuously contributing to the Interface and its Symposia, which few can match. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Analytics; Bayesian analysis; Cognitive computing; Computational statistics; Computer science; Computing; Computing and statistics; Computing in statistics; Computing science; Data mining; Data science; Data scientist; Deep learning; Empirical bayes; Interface foundation of north america; Interface of computer science and statistics; Interface of computing and statistics; Interface of computing science and statistics; Interface symposia; Interface symposium; Machine learning; Machine reasoning; Pearl causal reasoning; Quantum computing; Rubin causal reasoning; Statistical analysis; Statistical learning; Statistics; Statistics in computing; Symposium on the interface of computer science and statistics; Symposium on the interface of computing and statistics; Symposium on the interface of computing science and statistics; watson","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Biographies; Computer games; Computer science; Data mining; Learning systems; Quantum computers; Software packages; Statistical methods; Analytics; Bayesian Analysis; Causal reasoning; Cognitive Computing; Computational statistics; Computing; Computing science; Data science; Data scientist; Deep learning; Empirical Bayes; Quantum Computing; Statistical learning; watson; Statistics",,,,,,"Goodman, A., The interface of computer science and statistics: an historical perspective (1968) Am Stat, 22, p. 1; Goodman, A.F., The interface of computer science and statistics (1972) Nav Res Log Quart, 18, p. 2; Goodman, A.F., American Statistical Association, on its 125th anniversary (1975) Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Technology, 3. , In: Belzer J, Holzman AG, Kent A, eds.,.

To foster the development and use of data science applications in healthcare, there is a fundamental need for access to EHR data, which is typically not readily available to researchers and developers. A relatively rare exception is the large EHR database, the Stockholm EPR Corpus, comprising data from more than two million patients, that has been been made available to a limited group of researchers at Stockholm University. Here, we describe a number of data science applications that have been developed using this database, demonstrating the potential reuse of EHR data to support healthcare and public health activities, as well as facilitate medical research. However, in order to realize the full potential of this resource, it needs to be made available to a larger community of researchers, as well as to industry actors. To that end, we envision the provision of an infrastructure around this database called HEALTH BANK - the Swedish Health Record Research Bank. It will function both as a workbench for the development of data science applications and as a data exploration tool, allowing epidemiologists, pharmacologists and other medical researchers to generate and evaluate hypotheses. Aggregated data will be fed into a pipeline for open e-access, while non-aggregated data will be provided to researchers within an ethical permission framework. We believe that HEALTH BANK has the potential to promote a growing industry around the development of data science applications that will ultimately increase the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare.

Based on the concept of lean software development we propose an idea of lean data science research as a technology for data analysis software development. This concept includes the mandatory stages of the life cycle that meet the lean manufacturing principles. We have defined the business understanding stage with defining the targeted questions, the set of lean data analysis sprints and a decision support stage. Each lean data analysis sprint contents of the task statement step, a step of data integration, a step of data analysis and the interpretation of the results. This approach allows to build data analysis software with iterative improvement quality of the results. Some case study have been suggested as examples of the proposed concept. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","data analysis; data science; software development","Data reduction; Decision support systems; Knowledge based systems; Life cycle; Software design; Software engineering; Business understanding; Data analysis softwares; Data engineering; data science; Decision supports; Iterative improvements; Lean manufacturing; Lean software development; Quality control",,,,,"14-0700945_a, RFBR, Russian Foundation for Basic Research","Hey, T., Tansley, S., Tolle, K., (2009) The Fourth Paradigm: Data-Intensive Scientific Discovery, , Microsoft Research, Redmond; http://esciencecenter.nl/, eScience CenterConway, D., The Data Science Venn Diagram, , http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram; Is Data Science the End of Statistics? a Discussion, , http://www.kdnuggets.com/2013/04/data-science-end-statistics-discussion.html; CS109 Harvard Data Science Course, , http://cs109.org/, Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Science; IPython:notebookEPJ Data Science, , http://www.epjdatascience.com/; Leffingwell, D., Agile Software Requirements: Lean Requirements Practices forTeams, Programs, and the Enterprise Agile Software Development Series, , Addison-Wesley, Pearson Education, Inc; Poppendieck, M., Poppendieck, T., (2003) Lean Software Development: An AgileToolkit, , Addison-Wesley Longman Publishing Co., Inc., Boston; Poppendieck, M., Poppendieck, T., (2013) The Lean Mindset: Ask the Right Questions, , Poppendieck LLC; Nisbet, R., Elder, J., Miner, G., (2009) Handbook of Statistical Analysis AndData Mining Applications, , Academic Press; Fayyad, U., Piatetsky-Shapiro, G., Smyth, P., From Data Mining toKnowledge Discovery in Databases (1996) AI Magazine, 17, p. 3754; Pedregosa, F., Varoquaux, G., Gramfort, A., Michel, V., Thirion, B., Grisel, O., Blondel, M., Duchesnay, E., Scikit-learn: Machine Learning in Python (2011) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 12, pp. 2825-2830; Guo, P., (2012) Software Tools to Facilitate Research Programming, , http://purl.stanford.edu/mb510fs4943, Ph.D. thesis.

Requirements for digital libraries to manage research data vary along many dimensions, including life cycle, scale, research domain, and types and degrees of openness. This article addresses the role of digital libraries in knowledge infrastructures for science, presenting evidence from long-term studies of four research sites. Findings are based on interviews ($$n=208$$n=208), ethnographic fieldwork, document analysis, and historical archival research about scientific data practices, conducted over the course of more than a decade. The Transformation of Knowledge, Culture, and Practice in Data-Driven Science: A Knowledge Infrastructures Perspective project is based on a 2 $$\times $$× 2 design, comparing two “big science” astronomy sites with two “little science” sites that span physical sciences, life sciences, and engineering, and on dimensions of project scale and temporal stage of life cycle. The two astronomy sites invested in digital libraries for data management as part of their initial research design, whereas the smaller sites made smaller investments at later stages. Role specialization varies along the same lines, with the larger projects investing in information professionals, and smaller teams carrying out their own activities internally. Sites making the largest investments in digital libraries appear to view their datasets as their primary scientific legacy, while other sites stake their legacy elsewhere. Those investing in digital libraries are more concerned with the release and reuse of data; types and degrees of openness vary accordingly. The need for expertise in digital libraries, data science, and data stewardship is apparent throughout all four sites. Examples are presented of the challenges in designing digital libraries and knowledge infrastructures to manage and steward research data. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Big science; Data management; Digital libraries; Little science; Open access; Open data; Scholarly communication",,,,,,"Alfred P.

However, while the data access problem is largely (though not completely) solved, remote sensing data is still sometimes difficult to find, in part because of the myriad data sources. Data can also be difficult to use, especially for first-time users of a particular data set, due to complex data structures and data formats, as well as the need to understand how ancillary and quality information should be used in analysis. We propose the development of an Earth Science Collaboratory (ESC), which would be a rich science data analysis environment available to the community. The ESC would integrate tools and services with datasets and facilitate the sharing of the related knowledge. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Collaboration; collaborative tools; geosciences; online communities; remote sensing","Collaboration; Collaborative tools; Collaboratories; Complex data structures; Data access; Data sets; Data-sources; First-time user; Geosciences; Online communities; Quality information; Remote sensing data; Science data analysis; Earth sciences; Information management; Remote sensing; Quality control; data management; data quality; data set; Earth science; remote sensing",,,,,,"Gray, J., Liu, D., Nieto-Santisteban, M., Szalay, A., Dewitt, D., Heber, G., Scientific data management in the coming decade (2005) SIGMOD Rec, 34 (4), pp. 34-41. , Dec; Bernholdt, D., Bharathi, S., Brown, D., Chanchio, K., Chen, M., Chervenak, A., Cinquini, L., Williams, D., The earth system grid: Supporting the next generation of climate modeling research (2005) Proc.

Although some conceptions of data science focus primarily on analytical methods, data scientists must also have a deep understanding of how project data were collected, preprocessed and transformed. These processes strongly influence the analytical methods that can be applied, and more importantly how the results of those methods should be interpreted. In the present chapter we provide background information on educational challenges for data scientists and report on the results of a workshop where experts from the information field brainstormed on the educational dimensions of data science. Results of the workshop showed that data scientists must possess a breadth of expertise across three areas - curation, analytics, and cyber-infrastructure - with deep knowledge in at least one of these areas. Workshop participants also underscored the importance of domain knowledge to the success of the data science role. Additionally, the workshop highlighted a factor that differentiates data science from other professional specialties: the emphasis on serving the data needs of information users and decision makers. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",,"Data visualization; Information management; Information services; Background information; Cyber infrastructures; Educational challenge; Heterogeneous data; Information professionals; Information users; Science education; Workshop participants; Metadata",,,,,,"Allard, S., Levine, K.J., Tenopir, C., Design engineers and technical professionals at work: Observing information usage in the workplace (2009) J.

This paper discusses the architecture of Learn2Mine, the research that guided its development, and the pilot implementation and formative assessment of its use in teaching data science. Learn2Mine was pilot-tested in Fall 2013 in an introductory data science source. At the end of the term, a survey of students concerning their experiences with the environment was conducted. Quantitative analysis of survey data showed that student opinion about the usefulness of the tool for learning course content was positive. Through open-ended comments, students provided constructive feedback on how the system might be improved. To collect expert opinion on both the didactic and usability aspects of the Learn2Mine system, a number of experts were enlisted to try the system. Experts responded to a survey regarding criteria typically expected of instructional software, such as system usability and flexibility, as well as accuracy and organization of content. Overall, the responses from experts were extremely positive. A plan for further development of the system, based on these results, is presented along with information on the developers' plans for making the environment available for use at other institutions. © 2014 IEEE.","big data; computer science; Data mining; data science; interdisciplinary; machine learning; statistics; tools","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Curricula; Data mining; Education; Learning systems; Statistics; Students; Surveys; Teaching; Tools; Constructive feedback; data science; Formative assessment; Instructional software; interdisciplinary; Online environments; Pilot implementation; System usability; Big data",,,,,,"Anderson, P., Bowring, J., McCauley, R., Pothering, G., Starr, C., An undergraduate degree in Data Science: Curriculum and a decade of implementation experience SIGCSE Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education, pp. 145-150. , 5-8 March 2014.

These circumstances often hinder current and future researchers significantly in reuse and comprehension of data. To support researchers during the archiving and provision of materials science research data (incl. supplementing material), a Quality Management Manual (QMM) approach as an established QM tool is proposed in this paper. Quality-assurance of experimental research data and the perpetuation of good scientific practice in provision and archiving research data are examined before the QMM approach is applied in a case study. The preliminary results indicate that QMM allows to provide practitioners basic guidelines which support integrity, availability and reusability of experimental research data in materials science for subsequent reuse. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2014.","data quality; experimental research data; materials science; QM","Experiments; Knowledge based systems; Materials science; Quality management; Reusability; Data quality; Experimental research; Good scientific practices; QM; Research data; Science research; Industrial management",,,,,"DFG, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft","Enke, H., Fiedler, N., Fischer, T., Gnadt, T., Ketzan, E., Ludwig, J., Rathmann, T., Leitfaden Zum Forschungsdaten-Management (2011) WissGrid Deliverable, , 2.3.1, Version 0.6, WissGrid; Winkler-Nees, S., (2010) Der Umgang Mit Forschungsdaten In Wissenschaft Und Lehre, , DFG, Bad Honnef; Neuroth, H., Oßwald, A., Scheffel, R., Strathmann, S., (2009) Nestor Handbuch: Eine Kleine Enzyklopädie Der Digitalen Langzeitarchivierung, , M.

It reviews the vast and varied literature on this topic to provide practical advice on whether, and how, data should be communicated. This book is based on five overarching themes. Firstly, there needs to be an increased awareness of the many factors and complexities to be considered, and also of the possible choices, when selecting and presenting data. Secondly, there should be a recognition of the close and inseparable relationship between public health data selection and presentation with communication purpose, intended audience(s), and communication context. Thirdly, there should be an understanding that data should support a science-based storyline, that is, the conclusion(s) based upon the current state of scientific knowledge about a specific public health topic. Next, this needs to be used ethically and in such a manner as to maximize impact. Finally, selecting and presenting data needs to avoid unintended consequences (e.g., audiences failing to attend to messages, becoming overly fearful or ""underconcerned,"" or misunderstanding a storyline in some other way). After reviewing health communication basics, lay audiences' understanding of mathematics, common psychological tendencies affecting data understanding, and methods for presenting data, the book provides a simple framework (OPT-In) for selecting and presenting data. It also covers common public health situations faced by public health practitioners, such as education efforts to encourage healthier behaviors, acute public health situations, and advocacy. Bridging the gap between research and practice, the book contains many examples of successful data communication to lay audiences in real-world situations, stressing positive examples of ""how to do it better"". © 2009 by Oxford University Press, Inc.

The methodology has three main phases: Knowledge of the Organization, Preparation and treatment of data, and finally, development of the DM application. We will focus on the second phase. The main contribution of this proposal is the design of a methodological framework of the second phase based on the paradigm of Data Science (DS), in order to get what we have called 'Vista Minable Operacional' (VMO) from the 'Vista Minable Conceptual' (VMC). The VMO built is used in the third phase. This methodological framework has been applied in two different cases of study, oil and public health. © 2014 IEEE.","data mining; data science; health management; industrial processes; knowledge engineering","Data mining; Knowledge engineering; Data mining applications; data science; Health management; Industrial processs; Methodological frameworks; Organizational analysis; Second phase; Third phase; Data handling",,,,,,"Schreiber, A., Akkermans, J., Anjewierden, A., Hoog, R., Shadbolt, N., Van De Velde, W., Wielinga, B., (1999) Knowledge Engineering and Management: The CommonKADS Methodology, , mit Press, Cambridge, ma; Henao, M., (1998) La Adquisición Del Conocimiento Dentro de la Ingeniería Del Conocimiento, 110, pp. 53-60. , Revista: Universidad eafit ISSN: 0120-341x; Henao, M., (2001) Una Metodología Para El Desarrollo de Sistemas Basados en El Conocimiento de Tiempo Real, , Tesis Doctoral.

Traditional data mining tools (Matlab, R, etc.) are becoming redundant in the analysis of these datasets, as they are unable to process or even load the data. Parallel and scalable techniques, though, bear the potential to overcome these limitations. In this contribution we therefore evaluate said techniques in a High Performance Computing (HPC) environment on the basis of two earth science case studies: (a) Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) for automated outlier detection and noise reduction in a 3D point cloud and (b) land cover type classification using multi-class Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in multispectral satellite images. The paper compares implementations of the algorithms in traditional data mining tools with HPC realizations and 'big data' technology stacks. Our analysis reveals that a wide variety of them are not yet suited to deal with the coming challenges of data mining tasks in earth sciences. © The Authors.

Much of the continuing discussion in the materials development community is therefore focused on the creation of novel materials innovation ecosystems designed to dramatically accelerate materials development efforts, while lowering the overall cost involved. In this paper, it is argued that the recent advances in data science can be leveraged suitably to address this challenge by effectively mediating between the seemingly disparate, inherently uncertain, multiscale and multimodal measurements and computations involved in the current materials' development efforts. Proper utilisation of modern data science in the materials' development efforts can lead to a new generation of data-driven decision support tools for guiding effort investment (for both measurements and computations) at various stages of the materials development. It should also be recognised that the success of such ecosystems is predicated on the creation and utilisation of integration platforms for promoting intimate, synchronous collaborations between crossdisciplinary and distributed team members (i.e. cyberinfrastructure). Indeed, data sciences and cyberinfrastructure form the two main pillars of the emerging new discipline broadly referred to as materials informatics (MI). This paper provides a summary of current capabilities in this emerging new field as they relate to the accelerated development of advanced hierarchical materials (the internal structure plays a dominant role in controlling overall properties/performance in these materials) and identifies specific directions of research that offer the most promising avenues. © 2015 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining and ASM International.","Cyberinfrastructure; Data science; Materials informatics; Metamodels; Microstructure quantification; Process-structure-property linkages; Reduced-order representations; Spatial correlations","Decision support systems; Ecology; Ecosystems; Information science; Cyber infrastructures; Data science; Materials informatics; Meta model; Process structures; Reduced order; Spatial correlations; Data reduction",,,,,,"Fullwood, D.T., Niezgodab, S.R., Adamsa, B.L., Kalidindi, S.R., Microstructure sensitive design for performance optimization (2010) Prog.

We show that these terms are not only becoming popular but are also relevant to supply chain research and education. Data science requires both domain knowledge and a broad set of quantitative skills, but there is a dearth of literature on the topic and many questions. We call for research on skills that are needed by SCM data scientists and discuss how such skills and domain knowledge affect the effectiveness of an SCM data scientist. Such knowledge is crucial to develop future supply chain leaders. We propose definitions of data science and predictive analytics as applied to SCM. We examine possible applications of DPB in practice and provide examples of research questions from these applications, as well as examples of research questions employing DPB that stem from management theories. Finally, we propose specific steps interested researchers can take to respond to our call for research on the intersection of SCM and DPB. © 2013 Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals.","big data; collaboration; data science; design; education; integration; logistics; predictive analytics; supply chain management",,,,,,,"Barton, D., Court, D., Making Advanced Analytics Work for You (2012) Harvard Business Review, 90, pp. 79-83; Carraway, R., Big Data, Small Bets (2012) Forbes, , http://www.forbes.com/sites/darden/2012/12/13/big-data-small-bets/; Chen, H., Chiang, R., Storey, V., Business Intelligence and Analytics: From Big Data to Big Impact (2012) MIS Quarterly, 36 (4), pp. 1165-1188; Davenport, T., Patil, D., Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century (2012) Harvard Business Review, 90, pp. 70-76; Dumbill, E., Liddy, E., Stanton, J., Mueller, K., Farnham, S., Educating the Next Generation of Data Scientists (2013) Big Data, 1 (1), pp. 21-27; Mayer-Schönberger, V., Cukier, K., (2013) Big Data: A Revolution That Will Transform How We Live, Work, and Think, , New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company; McAfee, A., Brynjolfsson, E., Big Data: The Management Revolution (2012) Harvard Business Review, 90, pp. 60-68; Provost, F., Fawcett, T., Data Science and Its Relationship to Big Data and Data-Driven Decision Making (2013) Big Data, 1 (1), pp. 51-59","Waller, M.A.; Sam M.

These programs are aimed at training scientists and engineers to tackle problems requiring interdisciplinary approaches to finding solutions to scientific and engineering problems and the development of new computing, as exemplified by the co-design approach to exascale architectures and applications. Thus, the programs emphasize preparation in applied mathematics, numerical analysis, and scientific computing in addition to science and engineering work relevant to the target application. The rise of so-called 'Big-Data' applications and the use of large data in business decision support and even in computational science workflows like uncertainty analysis are driving a need for training in data sciences. This paper makes the argument that, rather than treating topics in machine learning, statistics, etc. as stand-alone fields of study that students learn as electives, data-science should be an integral part of interdisciplinary training for future researchers. This approach is at the core of the newly developed Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering (CDSE) Ph.D. program at the University of Buffalo. This paper describes the development of the Ph.D. program, the target student audience, and strategies for effectively executing the proposed curriculum. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Application programs; Artificial intelligence; Curricula; Decision support systems; Digital storage; Learning systems; Personnel training; Uncertainty analysis; Applied mathematics; Business decision supports; Co-design approach; Computational science; Engineering problems; Interdisciplinary training; Science and engineering; Scientists and engineers; Big data",,,,,,"http://analytics.ncsu.eduhttp://datascience.nyu.eduhttp://idse.columbia.eduhttp://www.cs.utah.edu/admissions/tracks/data.shtml#PhDhttps://www.krellinst.org/csgfhttps://www.ices.utexas.edu/graduate-studieshttp://exploredegrees.stanford.edu/schoolofengineering/instituteforcomputationalandmathematicalengineering/#doctoraltexthttps://www.sc.fsu.edu/graduate/phdhttp://www.cseprograms.gatech.edu/csephdhttp://www.caam.rice.edu/gradprogram.htmlAkcelik, V., Bielak, J., Biros, G., Epanomeritakis, I., Fernandez, A., Ghattas, O., Kim, E.J., Urbanic, J., High resolution forward and inverse earthquake modeling on terascale computers (2003) Proceedings of the 2003 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing, SC '03, p. 52. , New York, NY, USA ACM; Keyes, D., Computational and applied mathematics in scientific discovery (2004) Office of Science & Technology Policy Briefing; Kim, G., Govindaraju, V., A lexicon driven approach to handwritten word recognition for real-time applications (1997) IEEE Transactions Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 19, pp. 366-379; Mâtre, O.L., Knio, O., (2010) Spectral Methods for Uncertainty Quantification, , Springer; Manyika, J., Chui, M., Brown, B., Bughin, J., Dobbs, R., Roxburgh, C., Byers, A.H., (2011) Big Data: The Next Frontier for Innovation Competition, and Productivity, , McKinsey Global Institute; Miller, C.C., (2013) Data Science: The Numbers of Our Lives, , New York Times, April 11; Rohit, S., Patra, A., Chaudhary, V., Integrating data and compute-intensive workflows for uncertainty quantification in large-scale simulation: Application to model-based hazard analysis (2014) Int.

This panel focuses on the opportunities and challenges this poses for the Information Systems (IS) community. Specifically, the panel focuses on three key questions at the nexus of data science, skills, and IS: a) characterizing the changes in skill demand from industry in a variety of international contexts, b) evaluating the role of IS departments in educating the next generation of these workers, and c) identifying how IS research should adjust to complement new educational initiatives. These questions are provocative because they are rooted in a debate about whether industry investment in modern data technologies requires new workers and skills, new courses and faculty, and a new knowledge base, or whether data science is best understood as a rebranded phenomenon that will be rapidly and effectively absorbed into existing infrastructure.","Big data; Data science; Information systems; IS education; IS skills","Education; Information systems; Investments; Knowledge based systems; Teaching; Data science; Data technologies; Growing demand; IS educations; Is researches; IS skills; Knowledge base; Big data",,,,,,"Mckinsey Global Institute., (2011) Big Data: The Next Frontier for Innovation, Competition, and Productivity, , http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/business_technology/big_data_the_next_frontier_for_innovation; Rooney, B., Big data's big problem: Little talent (2012) Wall Street Journal, , http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304723304577365700368073674, April 29.
