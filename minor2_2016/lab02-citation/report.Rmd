# Data Science

Data science is multidisciplinary field directed to knowledge extraction from data. It was called "datalogy"[@naur1966science p. 486]. Data science is often accoiated with "Big data", but there is some other features. Data science is focused around data analysis, statistics and organizing the knowledge[@dhar2013data].
Dhar argues that "Data Science might therefore imply a focus around data and Statistics"[-@dhar2013data]. 

The report is based on request by the phrase "Data Science" in the database of reviewed journals. (~200 papers)

Below you can find table of the words that were used in titles of the articles from the sample and frequency of its usage. In addition, there is a **wordcloud**. It is a visual representation of text data, typically used to depict keyword metadata (tags) on websites, or to visualize free form text.

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(CITAN)
library(tm)
library(pander)

data <- Scopus_ReadCSV("./scopus.csv")

keywords = stringr::str_c(as.character(data$Title), sep = " ", collapse = " ")

keywords = tolower(c(keywords))
keywords = removeWords(keywords, stopwords("english"))
keywords = removeWords(keywords, c("a", "the", "an", "data", "science"))
keywords = removePunctuation(keywords, preserve_intra_word_dashes = TRUE)
keywords = removeNumbers(keywords)


keywords = stringr::str_split(keywords, pattern = " ")

key = table(keywords)
key = sort(key, decreasing = TRUE)

key[1] = 0
key = sort(key, decreasing = TRUE)


library(wordcloud)

#wordcloud(names(key), key, scale = c(5, 0.5), min.freq = 3, random.order = FALSE, random.color = FALSE, colors= c("coral", "coral4"))


keys = data.frame(key)
keys$word = rownames(keys)
rownames(keys) = NULL

names(keys) = c("frequency", "keyword")
```

```{r results='asis'}
pandoc.table(keys[1:5,])
```

The plot shows the distribution of papers by its length. Dashed line is the mean. 

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(CITAN)
library(ggplot2)
sc <- Scopus_ReadCSV(filename = "./scopus.csv")
sc$pg <- sc$PageEnd - sc$PageStart

rating.mean <- mean(na.omit(sc$pg))
ggplot(sc, aes(x=pg)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth=1, alpha=.5, position="identity", colour = "black") +
    geom_vline(data=sc, aes(xintercept=rating.mean),
               linetype="dashed", size=1) +
    xlim(0, 35)

```
