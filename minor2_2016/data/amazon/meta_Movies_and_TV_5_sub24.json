{"description": "This intense thriller is a work of fiction with a factual basis. Aidan Quinn stars as Annibal Ramirez, an American naval officer with a striking resemblance to real-life international terrorist Carlos \"the Jackal\" Sanchez, the scourge of innocent people all over the world in the 1970s and '80s. Mistaken for Sanchez by the Israeli Mossad, Ramirez is arrested but subsequently recruited by the Mossad and the CIA to pose as Sanchez and set him up as a traitor to his underwriters. Ramirez leaves his family, receives training in all aspects of Sanchez's life, and is pulled into the netherworld of terrorism and espionage. Director Christian Duguay (Screamers) wisely emphasizes character growth over obligatory action, drawing compelling portraits of an American intelligence official (Donald Sutherland) preoccupied with Sanchez, his Israeli counterpart (Ben Kingsley), and Ramirez himself, a man whose identity has merged with a monster's.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000UEE6TC", "0783226853", "B000OYAT3U", "B003JLL2R2", "B000MXPE7O", "B00005JKBC", "0783226888", "B00441GYYC", "B004OB2EYQ", "6305263248", "B00005M2CO", "B00000K0DR", "B00005JLX2", "B002DU39GW", "B003O7I6SE", "B000B6H1YG", "B0062P3392", "B0000AZT7A", "B00003CXGV", "B00AEBB9EG", "B0000ACOXL", "B00H83EUQW", "B002EAYE42", "B00AEBB9N2", "B00AEFY9YY", "B000LV6OJE", "0790732149", "B0059XTTW8", "B00AG51V8E", "B000NOIVT0", "B00AEBB8O2", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B000GFLEKY", "B0039A9M7K", "B001PYD0PC", "B001KRVLCI", "B00DPUB56U", "B003L20IG0", "B00AEFXKZ8", "B000XT1P4S", "B002AT8K9W", "B003ASLJIQ", "B004ULNJIU", "B000QXDFRG", "B000E5N684", "B0010YVCB6", "B00BB67UNW", "B003ASLJJU", "B004HO6HWA", "B000E5N6KW", "0792844874", "B00102F5WK", "B004XQO90O", "B000SK5Z70", "0767837975", "B00DL48BM6", "B0019EXZY4", "0792841409", "B00005YUO1", "B008JFUNKU", "B00HT2L7VS", "B0045HCIYA", "B004SIP6VI", "6305428115", "B001NY4WYC", "B00022XE6S", "B00004XPPB", "6304806450", "B009AMAJPA", "B00003CWU3", "B0001FGBUW", "B0008ENHTO", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B00008979P", "B008XAT0TQ", "B00000K3TU", "0800141687", "B00CZB9BE8", "B00DDY45DI", "B00562I40K", "B00005JN2Z", "B005TZFZ5Q", "B005152C78", "B000035P5V", "B006GL8O0U", "B00003CWRX", "B001ER4CPC", "B005CM1ICK", "B000GGSMC6", "B00AEFXR8I", "B00008DDVT", "B000BT96DM", "B00005O0SO", "B00097DY2A", "B008JFURII", "B002GIBVVG", "B000DWMN2S", "B000I6BJ56", "6305262268"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000OYAT3U", "B001N44BVQ", "0792844017", "B003JLL2R2"]}, "price": 7.27, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 73948}, "asin": "0767806743", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JNZCXSGTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Assignment"}

{"description": "Nominated for seven Academy Awards&#xAE; in 1954, including Best Picture and Best Actor, THE CAINE MUTINY is a classic film about the unstable Captain Queeg (Humphrey Bogart) and his tumultuous command of an old minesweeper and her weary crew. On the high seas during the dramatic battles of World War II, Queeg&#x2019;s by-the-book approach pushes his crew and his popular second-in-command, Lt. Maryk (Van Johnson), to the breaking point. After a series of questionable orders, Maryk confronts Queeg when he orders the ship directly into the path of a deadly typhoon. Maryk invokes naval code and relieves Queeg of his command, forcing the crew to mutiny. Once safely back in port, Maryk is court-martialed for treason, setting off a tense trial that exposes the true state of Queeg&#x2019;s mind. Nominated for Best Actor, Humphrey Bogart gives a searing performance as he is systematically broken down in this classic tale of military conduct in a time of war.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FZETR0", "B0049985XW", "B00AEFXD1O", "B003ZEQMH8", "B000FFJYAW", "B00005R23T", "B000FFJYAM", "B00AEFXRWO", "B00005A0QS", "B00007ELD1", "B000FFJYAC", "B00004XPPC", "B002VWNIAY", "B007FQXEQO", "B00005N5S3", "B00AEFYBA6", "B0001NBMH6", "B00AEBB9YQ", "B00AEFXLKC", "B000O78L0U", "B000FFJYA2", "B000HWZ4C0", "B000NTPG6Q", "B0007TKNM4", "B000A2WJBQ", "B000CNESN0", "B0000AMRUP", "B0007TKNGA", "B000MGTQ7U", "B00005JKF6", "B0002TSZHY", "B0045HCJ9E", "B00871C09S", "B007FQXEVY", "B00003CXBU", "0792838408", "B0018E03CW", "B000EHSVSC", "B0002HOEQ2", "B00008AOTR", "B000O78L00", "B0001WTWWE", "B00008AOTO", "0767802470", "B0010YSD7W", "B003AWRMCO", "B00011D1OK", "B00114XLTQ", "0792841670", "B00005PJ8S", "B000EHSVS2", "B000E5N6KW", "0792839730", "B0000EYUDY", "B0006B2A42", "B0087ZG7OI", "B0009ML2KQ", "B001D8W7EK", "B000GIXLUW", "B00005PJ8K", "B0002ERWZ0", "B00005JN9P", "B00AEBB932", "B003B3V0X4", "B00005N5S2", "B006WQUGI2", "B006FE83UE", "B00096S4B2", "B00AEBB8OC", "0316955108", "B007Y1NR1W", "B000H1RFQ4", "B00K6J7Q1Q", "B00004XPPE", "B00C3ALLFS", "B00006RCO3", "B00AMSQBNK", "B00005PJ6V", "B00006ADD5", "B00008MTVZ", "B0001NBMGC", "0783229488", "B004GSVXBW", "B000O599Z8", "B000O599NK", "B003NF97KS", "B00005AUK7", "B0001MXX1U", "B007N31YH0", "B00008K76U", "B000ASDFHC", "B00AATV07S", "B0001NBMHQ", "B00AEFYRJQ", "B00003CXHJ", "B000HWZ4CA", "B006VRRGOO", "B000O599NA", "B00005LC4D", "B000087F79"], "bought_together": ["B000FZETR0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003ZEQMH8", "B00871C09S", "B000ASDFH2", "B00AEFYBA6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 134007}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.49, "brand": "Columbia Pictures", "asin": "0767809688", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DRZNB3JQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Caine Mutiny"}
{"description": "Spencer Tracy's last performance was in this well-meaning, handsome film by Stanley Kramer about a pair of white parents (Tracy and Katharine Hepburn) trying to make sense of their daughter's impending marriage to an African American doctor (Sidney Poitier). The film has been knocked over the years for padding conflict and stoking easy liberalism by making Poitier's character in every socioeconomic sense a good catch: But what if Kramer had made this stranger a factory worker? Would the audience still find it as easy to accept a mixed-race relationship? But there's no denying the drawing power of this movie, which gets most of its integrity from the stirring performances of Tracy and Hepburn. When the former (who had been so ill that the production could not get completion insurance) gives a speech toward the end about race, love, and much else, it's impossible not to be affected by the last great moment in a great actor's life and career.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003L9C1", "B000XJD34I", "B00003L9CK", "B0044WUZXW", "B00AATGDW0", "B00007G1ZL", "B000056HEH", "B00005PJ6T", "B0000JBALO", "B0006Z2LLK", "B0046BHC28", "B000053VBJ", "B0000V499C", "B006FE83UE", "B00079Z9VO", "B00AEFXD1O", "B001K2KM82", "B002VWNIBI", "B00003L9CG", "B001QVE3HS", "B004K4FUT8", "B00007CVRT", "B0000714BT", "B0002Y4TJM", "B00008L3UQ", "B0068FZ0W4", "B0010AN7Z4", "B0045HCJQW", "B000GETTIE", "B0009RCPUW", "B00AKGG5WG", "B00871C09S", "B000ION7AI", "B0007TKNHE", "B0001CNRBG", "B0045HCJ94", "B0087ZG7Q6", "B002M2Z3BA", "B000ZM1MG4", "B0045HCJ9E", "B00005RERR", "B0010YSD7W", "B00005A06N", "B00005PJ6V", "6304907729", "B002CWKU36", "B001ECDVK4", "B00GICP84W", "B000P2A22O", "B00066FABM", "B008NNSD78", "B0000X61YQ", "B001KXZGO6", "B000UPMZ0I", "B000056HEB", "B00006RCO1", "B0000549B0", "B0000CBY1C", "B0087ZG7R0", "B0007IO6NM", "B0000W5J4A", "B0007QJ1XE", "B001LPWGGY", "B000WTVZHQ", "B00005MEOU", "B0009X75QU", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B007N31YH0", "B0000TWMQ6", "B00003Q433", "B00AEBB9FA", "B00AEFYK5M", "B00004XMV9", "B000CCW2TS", "B001LPWGH8", "B0000TWMRU", "B004J2FJC4", "B0000DJZ8Q", "B00BTYRB3U", "B004GJYR7I", "B0009X75WE", "B000056MMM", "B00007GZR1", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B000JJSJPK", "B0007TKNM4", "B007Y1NR1W", "B001KXZGNW", "B0045HCJ7G", "B00005JKF6", "B000CEXEWA", "B00AEFYRJQ", "B00AMEZDK6", "B0007TKNH4", "B001GUYAZY", "B000BOH922", "B002VWNIAY", "B000667HHW", "B00AJCUL0I", "B00005LOLA"], "bought_together": ["B00003L9C1", "B000XJD34I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003L9C1", "B002VWNIBI", "B000XJD34I", "B004K4FUT8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 63570}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 29.95, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "0767821483", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B6NS7Q3KL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"}

{"description": "William Holden is the hunky drifter who rides the rails into a small Midwest town with dreams of landing a \"respectable\" job with his rich college buddy (Cliff Robertson). Kim Novak is the small-town beauty queen engaged to Robertson who falls for the cocky dreamer, as do repressed schoolmarm spinster Rosalind Russell and Novak's tomboyish kid sister Susan Strasberg. Their unleashed passions reach a crescendo at the Labor Day picnic.Joshua Logan directed William Inge's play on Broadway and carried it to Hollywood, earning Oscar nominations for Best Picture and Best Director in his screen-directing debut. Holden is years too old for the role but oozes sex appeal and makes a swoony stud when he takes his shirt off (or when, better yet, it's ripped from his back by a boozing Russell), and Novak is a lovely lost girl yearning for something she can't quite grasp. Arthur O'Connell earned an Oscar nomination as Russell's tippling boyfriend. The film was a huge popular and critical hit, but Logan's stiff and strident direction hasn't dated well. He makes his points in big capital letters--subtlety was never his strong point--and loses the natural beauty of the Kansas locations when he takes the climactic picnic scenes into an obviously artificial soundstage.Picnicremains a loved American classic, largely for Holden's tough-guy vulnerability and James Wong Howe's brilliant widescreen color photography.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003Q433", "B001LPWGGY", "B00008MTW2", "B00003L9CI", "B000068QJP", "B00AEFXLKC", "B0007US7FI", "B000JU8HBA", "B0002B15Y2", "B003MJQ9JM", "B004LB5FB8", "B000W089XI", "B000EBD9T4", "B0000DJZ8Q", "B00005JKF6", "B003WH765U", "B000CNESN0", "B00195I3OK", "B000VECAEY", "B00AEBB89C", "B0007US7EY", "B00BMEF6ZC", "B0087ZG7OI", "B00AATV07S", "B000F7CMQ8", "B00AEFY9GW", "0767821556", "B00AEBB8OC", "B0045HCJ8U", "B00004XPPC", "B00004XPPK", "B000EBD9TO", "B00003CXBZ", "B0006GANZK", "B0087ZG7R0", "B00004TWZH", "B001KXZGO6", "B00004TX2E", "B00FZRP8FU", "B00AMEZDK6", "B0002ERWZ0", "B00AATFJI4", "B00005BCK0", "B00L0DKO98", "0767821807", "B000062XEX", "B000JLTR9A", "B00004XMV9", "B00AEBB97S", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B00AEFXD1O", "B003J216LS", "B00BTYSIXC", "B00871C09S", "B00005AUKE", "B0008ENIAC", "B0007TKNHE", "B000JF5T5W", "082220892X", "B000WTVZHQ", "B00000K3D5", "B003O2H7MA", "B00AEBBA7W", "B00EL6ABL2", "B00EKGX2P0", "B001D8W7EK", "B00008MTW0", "B00066FAOE", "B00074DY16", "B0007MANZI", "B0045HCJ9E", "B002TOL4AK", "B0024FADC4", "B004H83IFU", "B001D8W7EU", "B00FNRA10E", "B000JLTRG8", "B00003CXBU", "B00005AUK7", "B0012OX7DA", "B000E1MXSW", "B001GUYAZY", "B00096S4DA", "B007TYI7YQ", "B000056H2H", "B003C6Y6VI", "B00K6D1QV8", "B00011D1OU", "B00DSAUKKY", "B00AJCUL0I", "B000KGGJ1I", "B000KE045M", "B000FUH38C", "B0006B2A7E", "B00005AUKC", "B0008ENIDO", "B000XT1P48", "B000MGBLHI", "B004NW8SYG"], "bought_together": ["B00003Q433", "B001LPWGGY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003O2H7MA", "B001LPWGGY", "B00008MTW2", "B00003Q433"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18405}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "0767827791", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CE99PHE5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Picnic: Restored"}

{"description": "Director Doug Liman's follow-up to the winningSwingersis a rollicking adventure that, while lacking in any substantial plot, speeds along with nonstop adrenaline and style to burn. Taking a cue fromPulp Fiction, Liman plays tricks with time and overlapping plots, all of which play out in L.A. and Las Vegas in a 24-hour period sometime between Christmas and New Year's. Slacker grocery-store clerk Ronna (Sarah Polley) is trying to score rent money by selling hits of Ecstasy at a rave party, but winds up inadvertently double-crossing a ruthless dealer (sexy and scary Timothy Olyphant). She's also invading the dealing turf of her coworker Simon (Desmond Askew), a Brit on his first trip to Vegas, which turns nightmarish after a jaunt with pal Marcus (Taye Diggs) to a \"gentleman's club\" turns violent. And then there's the two soap-opera actors (Jay Mohr and Scott Wolf) who cross paths with Ronna more than once in their attempts to divest themselves of a drug-related charge by participating in a sting.The way Liman and writer John August layer these stories owes a huge debt to Quentin Tarantino, but the comedy and action sequences rocket like a bat out of hell with energy, humor, and genuine surprise. In addition to some hilarious dialogue exchanges--including a classic scene between Ronna's stoned friend (Nathan Bexton) and a Zen cat--Liman works wonders with one the most winning ensembles in recent memory, a cast that includes both established actors and TV cuties. Mohr, Diggs, and especially Polley (doing a 180 from her turn inThe Sweet Hereafter) are as excellent as you'd expect, but it's Wolf (ofParty of Five) andDawson's Creek's Katie Holmes (as Polley's best bud) who turn in revelatory work; Holmes especially seems poised to be a breakout star. An amazing cinematic ride--like a roller coaster, you'll want to go back again and again.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00BTYPWFE", "B00316DDUO", "B00005JM23", "B004SIPALY", "B00004YMCF", "B0057ZAA6W", "B000K2V7E6", "B00007L4KI", "0767837398", "B00441GYVA", "B002UJIY7A", "B00441GYVK", "B002O3Z4VG", "B0004Z3242", "B0016MJ6T2", "B00005PJ7G", "B00000F0AD", "B000P0J0D8", "B00DW5IKYS", "B00JQF7ZR6", "B0000560PU", "0792840127", "6305594333", "B000QUEQ4K", "0783229526", "B00029RTAI", "B009M4KTUG", "B00005JMX6", "B002NZK5SM", "B000ALM40I", "B00AEFXESQ", "B001RXB4Q8", "B00003CXGA", "B00827OWO8", "B00AEFXUXU", "B00001PE4D", "B002AF4Y9G", "B004P7CN7W", "B000021Y77", "B000YW8RN6", "B0012RLX88", "B004SIP9CO", "B00AEFYZCU", "B00DW5IL92", "B00000JSJC", "B008NA3I30", "0767818024", "B00003CWSX", "B000087F7E", "B0000797IO", "B0001Z52RU", "B000A7LR6Y", "B003TRMLQM", "B00DEKKEPO", "B00005Q4CS", "1558908382", "B0021L8UXA", "0767802519", "B00005T30L", "B004ULEEXY", "B000GGSMC6", "0783235380", "B00008RH3J", "B0008FXT1Y", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0053TWVQ4", "B000XJ5UEY", "B00005U14H", "B00447L4KA", "B00003CWQR", "B00441GZ00", "B004YCKKFK", "B004OUZLGK", "B00000IBL1", "B00AEFXE9U", "B00005JMJG", "B0058ZPNOK", "B000NJWIPI", "B000PHX5MS", "B000F6II1M", "B00BTYJYOY", "B000WC38EQ", "B00FRILRW0", "B000FKO5QK", "B00005JPF3", "B004SIP95G", "B00441GYZ6", "B00007ELER", "B00000JMOD", "B001AIQ14K", "B00008977D", "B00007ELEN", "B000PAAJZ6", "B00049QQHI", "B001GKJ2E8", "B000QXDCLA", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B001152TL6"], "bought_together": ["B00BTYPWFE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00006ADFY", "B00007L4KI", "B000JJ4DNW", "B00003CWOL"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 43107}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.89, "brand": "Generic", "asin": "0767835093", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ycMxpvYQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Go (Special Edition)"}

{"description": "The Mack, a 1973 pimping epic, is at once a laughable, schlock classic and a harbinger of more serious black-themed films to come. Starring the now-forgotten Max Julien as Goldie, the preening ex-con whose dream is to rule the streets with a fine Cadillac and a fleet of topnotch hookers, this film is full of whip-crack, mostly improvised dialogue and hilarious stereotypes (the evil white cops, a wisdom-spouting blind man, and more trash-talkin' pimps than you could shake a walking stick at).Not only is the film one you can chuckle at in the postmodern, ironic mode, it is also a window on the world of today's rap superstars, many of whom have sampled, invoked, or quoted lines from this gaudy paean to pandering. In other words,The Mackis a kind of godfather to a future stark frankness about life on the streets. But forget the sociological hooey and dig into the piece as an urban costume picture with a greasy/funky score by R&B; genius Willie Hutch.Also, it features an amazing supporting turn by Richard Pryor, who, playing Tonto to Julien's Lone Ranger, unleashes torrents of nearly incomprehensible verbiage in the film's finest moments. Mind you, such brilliance is a direct comedy-organ transplant from Pryor's stand-up act: he was performing his \"Pimp on Blow\" routine at about the same timeThe Mackwas filmed. Seventy percent of this piece is dross, but the other 30 is the apex of urban surrealism. One vignette to tantalize: Goldie hypnotizing his \"ladies\" into docile submission as they sit in a planetarium, mechanically repeating his words: \"I will remain a lady at all times...\"--David Was", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300269167", "B000053VBA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 401532}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.85, "brand": "", "asin": "078060959X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F7Q516CVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Mack [VHS]"}
{"description": "Delivering exactly what its title promises, this celebration of stupidity was Jim Carrey's 1994 follow-up toAce Ventura: Pet DetectiveandThe Mask. The film pairs the rubber- faced wacky man with Jeff Daniels as the not-so-dynamic duo of Lloyd and Harry, dunderheads who come into the possession of a briefcase containing ransom money that is intended for Mob-connected kidnappers.  Lauren Holly costars as the woman who lost the briefcase, and with whom Carrey falls in love (both in real life and as his moronic on-screen character). As Lloyd and Harry make a mad dash to return the briefcase (never aware of its contents), the bumbling buddies attract Mobsters, cops, and trouble galore.  This lowbrow laugh-a-thon scores some solid hits for hilarity, but with gags involving ill-fated parakeets, buxom bimbos, and an overdose of laxatives, be prepared to put your brain--and good taste--on hold.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790732157", "B00AEBBA2C", "B002BIULKS", "B000P0J06A", "B00081912E", "B00AEFXIUK", "B0000CDRVX", "B00003CXE4", "0783235070", "B008R65XUQ", "0800141687", "B008R65XTC", "630529142X", "B00AEBB9DM", "B001G5T6GW", "B0009HBPN0", "B00AEFYS2M", "B00005JMYI", "B00AEFY0F2", "B004H83IM8", "B003CRM6PA", "B000BKVQS4", "B001SN78JO", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00005JNBQ", "B00005JM4Q", "B0000AKCKI", "B003Y5H5B0", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B00AEFXDO6", "B00AEFXJS6", "B000FP2OPO", "B00000K3U4", "B000A7DVR2", "6304696221", "6305433925", "B000ELJAEM", "B001VLBDD0", "B00AEFXP8K", "B000MMMT9G", "B002ZG97TW", "B000VG66XS", "B0090SI53C", "B000G0O5I2", "B000J4P9P8", "B000WZEZGI", "B004EPYZS0", "B004SIP95G", "B000AP04L0", "B000P0J09W", "B004H83IJQ", "B00AEFYVMO", "B001AEF6C2", "B00004RJ73", "B002GSXKPG", "B000E5N684", "B0000A02TZ", "B0001Z4OXS", "B0009X761E", "B00AEFYPXY", "B0006GANPA", "B0001FR3IQ", "0783227388", "B00AEFZE48", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B006TTC5GS", "B000EQHXOG", "B00AEBBA2W", "B000068TR1", "B000P0J0EW", "B001DJLD0S", "B002ZG99N6", "B00000K3UU", "B006TTC50Y", "B00007AJGH", "B00005PJ6N", "B0000696I1", "B00004TJMW", "B0016MJ6J2", "6305236569", "B002ZG980U", "B002SJIO4A", "B000E8N8H0", "B001J9KJ4I", "B00005JKMN", "B0006HBZE2", "B002ZG99H2", "B001AGXEAG", "B005LAIIJY", "B00008975Z", "B00G2P79BU", "B00000IQBW", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AJCUL1C", "B0001Z52RU", "B00003CXZ4", "B00029RTCG", "B0009PVZ9Q", "B0018QPPXW", "B000065V3P"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B006HGXGWA", "B002BIULL2", "0790732157", "B003PIUIHO"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 38289}, "asin": "0780618556", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XVZYDA0ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dumb and Dumber"}
{"description": "Even if the notorious 1970s porn-filmmaking milieu doesn't exactly turn you on, don't let it turn you off to this movie's extraordinary virtues, either.Boogie Nightsis one of the key movies of the 1990s, and among the most ambitious and exuberantly alive American movies in years. It's also the breakthrough for an amazing new director, whose dazzling kaleidoscopic style here recalls the Robert Altman ofNashvilleand the Martin Scorsese ofGoodFellas. Although loosely based on the sleazy life and times of real-life porn legend John Holmes, at heart it's a classic Hollywood rise-and-fall fable: a naive, good-looking young busboy is discovered in a San Fernando Valley disco by a famous motion picture producer, becomes a hotshot movie star, lives the high life, and then loses everything when he gets too big for his britches, succumbs to insobriety, and is left behind by new times and new technology. Of course, it ain't exactlyA Star Is BornorSingin' in the Rain.  Writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson (in only his second feature!) puts his own affectionately sardonic twist on the old showbiz biopic formula: the ambitious upstart changes his name and achieves stardom in porno films as &quot;Dirk Diggler.&quot; Instead of drinking to excess, he snorts cocaine (the classic drug of '70s hedonism); and it's the coming of home video (rather than talkies) that helps to dash his big-screen dreams. As for the britches ... well, the controversial &quot;money shot&quot; explains everything. And the cast is one of the great ensembles of the '90s, including Oscar nominees Burt Reynolds and Julianne Moore, Mark Wahlberg (who really can act--from the waist up, too!), Heather Graham (as Rollergirl), William H. Macy, John C. Reilly, and Ricky Jay. DVD extras include nine deleted scenes and a commentary track from Anderson.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CWTI", "B008220DGE", "B00000G02H", "B000E33VWW", "B000LPS4L6", "B004SEUJXM", "B00000IC7G", "B00AEFXE9U", "B001P3SA8K", "B00008WI9N", "B00112S8RS", "B00AEBB8SS", "B0014GI6I2", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00441GYZ6", "B0013XZ2QK", "B002LVVCJY", "B004SIP71M", "B0000BXMZ8", "B00008K7AO", "B00320J6WS", "B00005BCK9", "6305803765", "B000A7DVR2", "6305781095", "B00005JKJA", "B00005JLRE", "B00005JLIF", "0767830555", "B004P7CMVE", "B0013D8LKO", "B004U7MR14", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B00AQBDU4Q", "0792838068", "B000063JDE", "B00049QQHI", "B000002UKO", "B0006GW2JU", "0767818024", "B00BEIYKM6", "B002GIBVVQ", "B000M341QE", "B00005ATQB", "B00008972P", "B0060ZJ7DA", "B00000JGNP", "B0009A40ES", "B0006TPE4C", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00002RAO2", "B00007AJF8", "B00005Q4CS", "B00005JMW7", "B0057ZAA6W", "B004XVMCH6", "6305428239", "B00000K3D3", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00006RCNV", "B000P0J09C", "B00005JMJG", "B000P0J09M", "B0000640VJ", "B00H9KKGTO", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00008RH3J", "6305594333", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0006GAOJA", "B003UESJHO", "B00ET2ODTE", "B00G7QPXUI", "0783225903", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B00029RTAI", "0767802519", "B00AEFXN9G", "B00003CXZ4", "079284646X", "B000C20VPA", "B004L9GMBC", "B002VWNICC", "0783229526", "B00AEBB9ZK", "B008220DIC", "B000J3OTT6", "0792833287", "B00005JMJ4", "B00008RH3L", "B0007UC8Y4", "B001CW7ZT4", "6305313687", "6304907729", "B000UJ48SQ", "B00H9HZITU", "B002QFYJF4", "B0060ZJ7BC", "B004SIP95G", "B000LP6KNU"], "bought_together": ["B00003CWTI", "B00000G02H"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFXE9U", "B000PAAJYW", "B0013FXWU6", "B008220DGE"]}, "price": 39.39, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 55143}, "asin": "0780621980", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WAT071HZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Boogie Nights"}

Now jobless and unable to support his family, his wife (Kelly Lynch) leaves him. In desperation he kidnaps Belafonte. The best part of the film is seeing African American actors filling the smaller, background roles that usually go to white actors (such as police officers and wealthy suburbanites), but the movie fails in its poorly thought-out ideas. Transposing the characters' skin color out of the thinly veiled metaphor, John Travolta's portrayal of the poor black man as violent and uneducated (but family oriented), combined with Belafonte's rich white man as just and compassionate (and also family oriented), borders on being truly offensive. The fact that it's helmed by an Asian American director, Desmond Nakano, only makes you wonder why Asian Americans are conspicuously absent (as are Hispanics) and where the heck they would fit into this world, anyway.--Andy Spletzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00013F2OA", "B00L5Y8GJC", "B00D9EJFS2", "B00JPFTW1E", "B00005A1TJ", "6305137323", "B005NHZAHS", "B000P0J0CE", "B000E40QC4", "B00CX7TOOG", "B00GSBQ2HU", "0790734737", "B0006HBJJS", "B00JU94ZPS", "B0002KPI1O", "B0016LFG4M", "B00AEFXRWO", "B00H9LHVHI", "B00008G6B2", "B00AL6P4A4", "1593764251", "B002NPCJRC", "B0002VEZ3U", "B0007Q6VY6", "B0015FQZIK", "B000056VZC", "B004X4O988", "B000BITV9W", "6305428441", "B00895FDYQ", "0792833279", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B004H0M32M", "B0000A5A11", "B000051YMS", "B006GRWCF2", "630542828X", "B000YGE18C", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B000002JVB", "B006JN86VW", "B000059TFO", "B00AEFYE08", "B001AQT0Z4", "B001W72VPW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0143038826", "B0058KGHX6", "B000QGEB1M", "0783227973"]}, "price": 12.93, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 155547}, "asin": "0783115008", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XH1STWRTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "White Man's Burden"}

{"description": "Steven Spielberg's first feature film, 1971'sDuel, is set on a desert highway. It stars Dennis Weaver as a driver being pursued by a menacing truck, which is following him with all the vengeance of the ancient furies. In this spiritual update from 1984, C.&nbsp;Thomas Howell plays a guy taking a drive-away car from Chicago to San Diego. On a whim, in the rain, and against his better judgment, he picks up a hitchhiker (Rutger Hauer). The hitcher quickly admits to being a murdering psychopath, and once Howell finally gets him out of his car, he is pursued with all the vengeance of the ancient furies. We're never sure if the hitcher is a figment of his imagination, making Howell a schizophrenic killer, or if he's real and Howell is the random victim of a wandering madman, which is how his potential new girlfriend (Jennifer Jason Leigh) thinks of him.

Fed up with the big city, Sue decides to head home to Iowa with the precious $27.50&nbsp;train fare she's kept in a sealed envelope since her arrival. The fare has gone up, however, and she is forced to pose as a 12-year-old to buy a half-price ticket. On the train, she has to dodge the suspicious conductors and bursts into the compartment of Major Phillip Kirby (Ray Milland), who falls for Sue's masquerade and harbors her for the night. The situation is further complicated by the major's fianc&eacute;e (Rita Johnson) and her savvy 12-year-old sister (Diana Lynn), the only one who sees through the ruse. Add a stay at the major's academy and some escapades with young, hormone-driven cadets, and you have an enjoyable, if not quite classic, silly comedy, well paced by Billy Wilder in his first directorial effort. Rogers's real-life mother appears in a small role as Sue's mother.

{"description": "After a career slump that plagued him through most of the 1980s, Al Pacino made a stellar comeback in this taut 1989 thriller, playing a weary New York police detective who falls in love with the woman (Ellen Barkin) who is the prime suspect in the murder case he's investigating. Expertly written by Richard Price and directed by Harold Becker, the story is designed to keep its central characters (and the viewer) in a state of constant suspicion and arousal--an emotional combination that sends dangerous sparks flying between Pacino and Barkin. Their chemistry is intense, and their love scenes are some of the hottest of any movie of its decade. ButSea of Loveis not merely concerned with cheap titillation. It's a riveting whodunit with scenes of nail-biting suspense and memorable dialogue that make it as interesting to listen to as it is to watch. Barkin had made a similarly sexy impression inThe Big Easy, and here she gives one of the best performances of her underrated career, matching Pacino's excellence scene for scene. The ending's a bit of a letdown because the murder solution comes somewhat out of the blue, but it's the acting and suspense that you'll remember most--qualities that makeSea of Loveone of the best films of its kind.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305262268", "B0043X1FNQ", "B00BTYRB3U", "B000HC2LHG", "B00008L3S6", "B00441GYPG", "0783226845", "B00AEBB95K", "B00000K3TU", "B00013RC66", "6305308837", "6305310335", "B0000AM6JI", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B0045HCJIK", "B0043X1FKY", "B003LR5BD0", "B004SUDQ1S", "6305065551", "B000E5N684", "B00000JGHL", "B000A9QK6E", "B000CNESTE", "B00004XPPB", "0790730979", "B000CBCWRG", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005K3NU", "B00AEFYD9K", "B00005JLX2", "0792844874", "B00127RAGC", "B002AS463W", "B0015OKWL2", "B002AT8KAG", "B0002T7YQW", "B000C20VRS", "6305213305", "079073219X", "B0009GX1CO", "B00AEFYC96", "B000H5TH1Q", "B0045HCJ8K", "B00009Y3PV", "B00441GYOM", "B00000J11D", "B000LP6KMQ", "0767810872", "B00005U2KC", "B00009WVSL", "B000EQ5SRK", "B00AEFYD2M", "B004YCKKFK", "B00015YVDG", "B00AEFXN9G", "B00003CWRX", "B00BLF9FYA", "B00AEBB9N2", "B00005JO5L", "B00005K3NV", "B000069HZP", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00AEFXIIW", "B00AEBB9EG", "6305428484", "B001NY4WYC", "B000059TGB", "B00006RCNY", "B002VWNICC", "B00AEFXG2U", "B00006L91I", "B006GVN05O", "B000087F6M", "B000UGBOT0", "B00AEFXKZ8", "B003AWRMA6", "B001TK80D4", "B002NZK5RI", "076782170X", "B000A9QK5K", "B00005OLYF", "0767817729", "B004499LX0", "B0001US62I", "B000GNOSDG", "B0006GANN2", "B00005JLJW", "B00005JMIJ", "B00AEFXBPM", "B0006HBZBK", "B00AEFYW64", "B00007G1YQ", "B0001FGBW0", "B000FO0AA6", "B003INBNOS", "0767802616", "B000A2UBN4"], "bought_together": ["6305262268", "B000HC2LHG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00C7MW53E", "6305262268", "B000HC2LHG", "0783226845"]}, "price": 33.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 231594}, "asin": "0783226918", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G3SG0CZAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sea of Love"}

{"description": "Winner of seven Academy Awards including Best Picture, Director, and Screenplay, this critical and box-office hit from 1973 provided a perfect reunion for director George Roy Hill and stars Paul Newman and Robert Redford, who previously delighted audiences withButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Set in 1936, the movie's about a pair of Chicago con artists (Newman and Redford) who find themselves in a high-stakes game against the master of all cheating mobsters (Robert Shaw) when they set out to avenge the murder of a mutual friend and partner. Using a bogus bookie joint as a front for their con of all cons, the two feel the heat from the Chicago Mob on one side and encroaching police on the other. But in a plot that contains more twists than a treacherous mountain road, the ultimate scam is pulled off with consummate style and panache. It's an added bonus that Newman and Redford were box-office kings at the top of their game, and while Shaw broods intensely as the Runyonesque villain,The Stingis further blessed by a host of great supporting players including Dana Elcar, Eileen Brennan, Ray Walston, Charles Durning, and Harold Gould. Thanks to the flavorful music score by Marvin Hamlisch, this was also the movie that sparked a nationwide revival of Scott Joplin's ragtime jazz, which is featured prominently on the soundtrack. One of the most entertaining movies of the early 1970s,The Stingis a welcome throwback to Hollywood's golden age of the '30s that hasn't lost any of its popular charm.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00066FBQG", "B00023P4R4", "B0019UGYK0", "B000CEXEWA", "B00008OE4W", "B000063US2", "B00441GYOM", "B00079Z9VO", "B000MNOX94", "0783240171", "B002VWNIAY", "B00001W9G0", "0792838408", "B0008ENHUI", "B006FE83UE", "B0008ENHTO", "6305128952", "B00BTYU3SK", "B000087F6M", "B00AEFXD1O", "B00407PNY2", "B00003CXBU", "B0045HCJ9E", "B00004XPPC", "B00AEFY66U", "B000ZM1MG4", "B004SEUJOQ", "6304907729", "B00008CMSX", "B0010YVCI4", "B000EHSVS2", "B00AKGG5WG", "B000FZETR0", "B00871C09S", "B0049985XW", "B0068FZ0GK", "B00005A06N", "0783226039", "B003LMPKSQ", "B000W1SZBS", "B00AEBB932", "B007STBUHI", "B00005MEOU", "B002HK9IDQ", "0767818105", "B000XJD34I", "B00008K76U", "B0000JBALO", "B0052YDMZE", "B00006ADD5", "B0087ZG7R0", "B002M2Z3BA", "B00003CXB5", "B00AEFY9GW", "B003L16F7C", "B000EHRVOW", "6304712936", "B003ZEQMH8", "B000RPCK2E", "B001KXZGO6", "B0006GAO5Y", "0790731886", "B000KX0IOU", "B000I0QL82", "B00008UALL", "B00AEBBA0E", "B0010AN7Z4", "B000YDBPAM", "B004SIP7F8", "B0000AM6IY", "B000FO0AA6", "B000BITV92", "B002VWNIBI", "B001LMAK88", "B00AATUZLU", "B0000CBY1C", "B002VWNID6", "0783225733", "B001EJW0SG", "B00006RCO1", "B007Y1NR1W", "B000O78L00"], "bought_together": ["B00066FBQG", "B0019UGYK0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00066FBQG", "B000MNOX94", "B0010YVCI4", "B00079Z9VO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30100}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.99, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "0783225873", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Nmqp86vQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Sting (Full Screen Edition)"}

{"description": "Ana&iuml;s Nin (Maria de Medeiros) is a young woman in 1930s Paris whose  husband is slowly defecting from art to working in a bank, leaving her very bored. When the then-unpublished Brooklyn writer Henry Miller (Fred Ward) enters her life, she embarks on a journey of seduction and sexual exploration that eventually leads from the writer to his wife, June (Uma Thurman), who finances her husband's life in Paris so he may praise her beauty in his writing. Unhappy with her husband's writing and her lovers' affair, June enters a jealous rage, forcing Henry into suffering-artist mode and Nin back to her husband. Despite having one of the more erotic scenes of the 1990s, between Nin and June, the film does not live up to its subject, largely due to a mediocre screenplay and flawed direction. The strength of the original material and Medeiros's decidedly unflawed performance, however, make it worth viewing.--James McGrath", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000CBG5PG", "B000TXPXAU", "6305132917", "015640057X", "B002AS463W", "B00023P4I8", "B000VLCRCW", "B003P9GN72", "B00005JMIJ", "B004SUDQC2", "B004GGQN1E", "B00003JRAV", "B0010SAGHS", "B005ZVIPG0", "B0002JZT5A", "B003XMKN2W", "B00005LPZW", "076782170X", "B0000D0YXU", "B0004Z32NI", "015652791X", "B00GPPXNIK", "B00005JKI5", "B006CR2PD0", "B000BGH29K", "0156029049", "B003XKNGNW", "B000E5N684", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B00827OWO8", "B0007TZHWA", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B0052ADPAU", "B000059LGL", "B0000BWVD9", "B00094AS4A", "B000PMFS2I", "B003Y5H59C", "B0000D0YXV", "B00005JKJA", "0156029030", "6305428484", "B000F0UUD2", "B000EQ5SRK", "0156260255", "B009M4KTUG", "B004XVMCMG", "B00K0MM4AM", "B00008972P", "B00006L92K", "B00006RJ97", "B00CPTUO1Y", "B000LAZDQA", "B00003CXPV", "B0002KQNKE", "B000DZ95MG", "B002JCYSL4", "B00008G7UL", "B0002KPIQY", "B000059XTM", "B0015FHDWM", "B000F8O45O", "B004VJJG92", "B00A7WHL08", "B0037QGS0A", "0553114700", "B000HC2LHG", "B004EI2NM2", "B000PKG8TM", "B0016I0AKU", "1573623849", "B00005JMJD", "B001PYD0KW", "B000L6S92E", "B0006IIPLM", "B00B022GVS", "B001EKP5D2", "0767812158", "B006M3M5FM", "B00AZAJXOE", "B00009W0U4", "B0013D8LKO", "B0079K4WEE", "B00177Y9TS", "B00005JKG1", "B00006L91I", "B0052ADPCI", "B00166UFA2", "B004YMATCY", "B000089769", "B00LEW3L5Y", "0156260271"], "bought_together": ["B000CBG5PG", "B002AS463W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002AS463W", "015640057X", "B000TXPXAU", "B000CBG5PG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 25741}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 21.9, "brand": "UNIVERSAL", "asin": "0783230559", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51gjdB9SitL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Henry &amp; June"}

{"description": "Woody Allen as a worker ant with an inferiority complex? Sylvester Stallone as an affable soldier ant who discovers that digging tunnels is cool? The animation playground we all knew so well is turning into a theme park full of in-jokes for grownups.Antzexplores age-old topics (one person--err, insect--can make a difference, individuality and social responsibility must exist side by side, war is hell) with comic asides and Woody Allen's funniest quips this side of PG (adults will chuckle at the socialist slogans bandied about as he campaigns for workers' rights). Sharon Stone voices the rebellious princess with a fun-loving streak that doesn't quite overcome her royal bearing and court training, but she can learn. Gene Hackman is all teeth (ants have teeth?) and menacing grins as the Army general plotting insect-icide. This bug's-eye view of life on Earth gives Allen's neurotic nonconformist an epic adventure of microscopic proportions: a devastating war with a termite colony, an odyssey to the fabled land of plenty (a picnic ground), and a race to save his fellow workers from certain death. Other voices include Anne Bancroft as the Queen, Christopher Walken, Jennifer Lopez, Danny Glover, Dan Aykroyd, Jane Curtin, and John Mahoney. The computer animation isn't exactly realistic but feels as solid and contoured as puppet animation with the smoothness and slickness of traditional cel cartoons, and the character designs and animation offer a marvelous range of expressions. The PG rating includes a gritty battle sequence that may frighten youngsters.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00007LVCM", "B0012EM5D8", "B00003CXJ4", "B0006JMLRK", "B000ION23A", "B00005JNQS", "B000MV9026", "B000M343BC", "B000RMJ4F8", "B005SDUV4E", "B0006UEVT0", "B0000640SC", "B004HO6I4M", "B001DPHDCY", "B002WJI2QQ", "B00CWM58WY", "B0000AOX0O", "B00003CXG7", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B005LAIISA", "6305161887", "B00029LO0Y", "B0000VV4W2", "B000AY74OG", "B007FF3HQM", "B008NNY9QW", "B001GCUO7A", "B0039N74CW", "B003E66Y84", "B006JD48LO", "B004EPZ034", "B000L22SG6", "B000H7JCK0", "B001PR0YEE", "B001U3D88M", "B00BTYSIWI", "B00CHVJODE", "B000A2WAQK", "B001LPWGFA", "B003H9M1Q2", "B00000JGOQ", "B0013FSL3E", "B00B7EQPNE", "B001GCUNWQ", "B00AFEX83C", "B000VBJEEG", "B00AEFXMSS", "B00CTNYLQA", "B000065V42", "B000056H26", "B0030IIZ4M", "B001ILFUD2", "B0084IHVGG", "B000CZ0PT4", "B00365F6I2", "B0046A9RMM", "B00E9ZATJO", "B00JK531ES", "B00000JL8E", "B003UMW63E", "B00ALMNCLQ", "B000BITUVG", "B00EBBGLFC", "B0084IHVUC", "B001ECQ75A", "B00004YNUM", "B00005TN8K", "B00AEFYO08", "B005LAIHW2", "B000EQ5UHS", "B000UFIYOO", "B001OMU6UM", "B00009M9BK", "B001NCDFTW", "B000UVKGPI", "B0042U94UQ", "B00009YXAW", "B0013FSWT2", "B005LAIH4A", "B004A8ZX0K", "B000E33W0S", "B000DWMYQ8", "B000AAF1TU", "B00005RDSQ", "B000ROAK2W", "B001ILFUDC", "B000GUJZ00", "0783219806", "B00HLTD2OE", "B000089773", "B001FAFO3W", "B000035Z48", "B0084IHVN4", "B00CQRN3QI", "B001HN6918", "B00005JN4W", "B00004R99S", "B00F522C7C", "B001PR0Y7Q", "B004LWZW7Y"], "bought_together": ["B00007LVCM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00007LVCM", "B00CWM58WY", "B004HO6I4M", "B0011ZNAIC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6637}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.81, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "0783231474", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51iCc1u153L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Antz"}
{"description": "Sigourney Weaver more than earned her Oscar nomination for Best Actress  inGorillas in the Mist, dominating every frame of Michael Apted's biopic about primatologist Dian Fossey. Tenderly mothering an orphaned gorilla infant or terrorizing an African poacher with a staged lynching, the statuesque star is never less than fiercely focused, a glamorous warrior for animal rights. As the amateur scientist who researched and spotlighted Rwanda's endangered mountain gorillas inNational Geographic, Weaver is the passionate heart that keeps an otherwise flaccid film alive--whether bracing anthropologist Louis Leakey to forcibly offer her services as census-taker of the mountain gorillas; or hanging out with the noble animals until she becomes the first person on record to make friendly physical contact with them; or waging sometimes-physical war on natives and Europeans who decimate the gorillas for trophies or zoo fodder. Unfortunately, the film's stodgy script and direction simply document Fossey's magnificent obsession, offering no insight into what lonely impulse of the soul led this extraordinary woman to climb up an African mountain to bond so strongly with gorillas. Cardboard characters include an eternally smiling, sexless African soulmate (John Omirah Miluwi), a perfect boyfriend (Bryan Brown) who has to be dumped in favor of gorilla-love, and stereotypical villains. Still, the African scenery is spectacular, and who can resist the cross-species thrill when the huge dark hand of Digit, Fossey's favorite, first rests in her outstretched palm?Gorillas in the Mistwill please those who savor Sigourney Weaver's Amazonian fervor and the pure fire of her physical and spiritual passion--and harbor a slightly misanthropic fondness for liaisons between beauties and beasts.--Kathleen Murphy", "related": {"also_bought": ["061808360X", "B00006JU8E", "B00004TX5J", "6305428506", "B00006LPGB", "0783240171", "B0000844M8", "B00001U0DU", "B0007R4T3U", "B00AEFY4IA", "B005QB2JR0", "B004X8W72O", "B004FN25KG", "B0001NBLYK", "B0000694XX", "B0001CNRAM", "B00AEFXPMG", "1841624187", "095644489X", "0395282179", "B004AOECXI", "B002GIBVVG", "B00008YLV8", "6305320950", "0547334168", "B00022PYZ2", "B000R7G9II", "B00AEBB9UK", "0767806239", "B0006HBZXS", "B001CFQO98", "B000BI5KV0", "B00003CXAF", "1596438657", "B00005JPXA", "B002NZK5RI", "B002PLMJ74", "0783225547", "B004BTL6NG", "630542828X", "B0001I55Y2", "B005QX8U2Q", "6305128952", "B0045HCJIK", "B000095WW8", "B000056KMW", "0452282020", "079073639X", "B0007TKI06", "B0002V7OI8", "B00132HXEK", "B00IBKXSKA", "B0007R4SYU", "1841624675", "079073219X", "B00003CXFV", "B00EL6AAEU", "B006TTC540", "B00705YBWQ", "B00002E22E", "0061131539", "B000ZIZX40", "B00000ILDF", "B004SIP7F8", "B003ASLJK4", "B003BI77AO", "B000R7HY00", "B000059HAN", "B00443FMHK", "0767805712", "B004SUDQ22", "0446387207", "B00AEFYSR2", "B00003CXQ4", "0767817729", "0783230532", "6304765258", "B000NOIX48", "6305213283", "B000V4UFZK", "B00008MTVY", "B00009AOBI", "B000A9QK7I", "B00009WVSL", "B0087ZG7PW", "B00003CWTI", "B0006FYOTC", "B0002V7ON8", "B000F6IODE", "B0000JBALO", "B0043X1FNQ", "B000063ING", "B00005T7HZ", "0783225733", "079283366X", "B000B8QG22", "B000O78KWE", "B00013RC84", "6305308837"], "bought_together": ["061808360X", "B00006JU8E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["061808360X", "0783240171", "B0009R1TJ0", "B0001NBLYK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14386}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.67, "brand": "UNIVERSAL", "asin": "0783233523", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KWVXFN15L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gorillas in the Mist"}

{"description": "Paul Newman and Julie Andrews star in what must unfortunately be called one of Alfred Hitchcock's lesser efforts. Still, sub-par Hitchcock is better than a lot of what's out there, and this one is well worth a look. Newman plays cold war physicist Michael Armstrong, while Andrews plays his lovely assistant-and-fianc&eacute;e, Sarah Sherman. Armstrong has been working on a missile defense system that will \"make nuclear defense obsolete,\" and naturally both sides are very interested. All Sarah cares about is the fact that Michael has been acting awfully fishy lately. The suspense ofTorn Curtainis by nature not as thrilling as that in the average Hitchcock film--much of it involves sitting still and wondering if the bad guys are getting closer. Still, Hitchcock manages to amuse himself: there is some beautifully clever camera work and an excruciating sequence that illustrates the frequent Hitchcock point that death is not a tidy business.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002IXSVI", "6300183513", "0790743213", "6300181340", "0783235682", "6300183580", "6301670159", "B000UVV25Q", "6301640667", "0783235615", "6300268748", "0783235607", "0783235674", "6301670140", "0783236352", "0783221347", "0783235593", "6301798503", "6303562248", "6301798759", "B000007NPV", "6301800974", "0783235623", "6300270386", "6303120474", "6304152450", "0800132009", "6301965760", "6303451535", "B00004RFFA", "B00000FZXC", "0782008348", "6300181529", "0792107683", "6300216217", "6305012792"], "bought_together": ["B0002IXSVI"], "also_viewed": ["B00BWJQEC6", "B00ARA4SLU", "B000CCW2TS", "B00F0IRN7U", "B001D8W7EK", "B00AQMGQVY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 233901}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.39, "brand": "", "asin": "0783235704", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WFN1SW9TL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Torn Curtain [VHS]"}

Meanwhile, Lelaina meets Michael (Stiller), an ambitious video executive who wants to showcase her documentary on \"In Your Face TV.\" Suddenly, she finds herself at the center of a very odd love triangle with dependable, fast-track Michael on the one side and a sexy, brooding Troy on the other.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001B3LIO2", "6305283516", "B0053TWVQ4", "B002O3Z4VG", "B000002WPW", "B00CIOD6HK", "B00003CXGA", "B000031EG0", "B0045DO84C", "B00000F0AD", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B00AEFXE9U", "0783230486", "6305428425", "B001PJRATE", "B002JOUNE8", "B004YCKJSS", "B000BOH904", "B00000IQW4", "B0009UZFZQ", "B00447L4KA", "B00029RTAI", "B00DJYJPLO", "B002D755A8", "B0043X1FOU", "B00AG475K8", "B001AEF6BS", "B004SIP95G", "B0000640VJ", "B00002VWE0", "B004SUDQ72", "B000065V3H", "6305144168", "B00AEFYM2S", "B00003CXDJ", "B007UW9W32", "B001AEF6BI", "B000M341QE", "6304907729", "B002AFX53M", "B00003CWQR", "0800177029", "B0000542C7", "B00BMKGZVA", "B0053TWVZA", "B000087EY5", "B000E5N684", "B000PAAJZ6", "B00027JZ3E", "B001UV4XUG", "B0007PALZ2", "B0009A40ES", "B0006GANPA", "B00005JNC2", "B0045HCJGW", "B00AG473GE", "B00008G7UL", "B00005AUJU", "B004UVYQVY", "B000CNESJO", "B0018YCF50", "B00AJCOZVY", "0800177258", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00005T7I1", "B00C6F61HS", "B000K7VHLY", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B005QX8UEE", "B0007UC8Y4", "B004SIP6LS", "B00007BKVC", "B00003CY6D", "B000065V3W", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEBB9DW", "B00029RTCG", "0767835093", "B004SIPALY", "B000765IJK", "B008R65Y28", "B00079Z9VO", "B00005JKFA", "6305313687", "B00AFEY354", "0767805712", "B00001W9G0", "B000GFLKF8", "B00006ZXSL", "B0000C3I99", "B0016Q2D66", "0783229402", "B00008G7UI", "B004P7CN7W", "B00005JLFA", "B001DN0V02", "B00AEFYCL4", "B0009UZGIM", "B002VWNIDG", "B000RGSOR8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00000IQW4", "B00008438V", "B00007AJGH", "B00005N7Z1"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 185128}, "asin": "0783227922", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FXQ4N7EGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Reality Bites"}

{"description": "This classic 1963 Disney film features child icon Hayley Mills  as Nancy Carey, a teenage girl whose family moves from Boston  to the New England countryside as a result of their father's untimely  passing.  Nancy writes to the kindly Mr.&nbsp;Poppem (Burl Ives) and  single-handedly convinces him to rent the family a charming, if run-down,  house for a mere $60 a year. Ever the optimist, Nancy brims with  excitement at the family's new life, but this \"perfect world\" has its  problems--notably an absentee landlord who knows nothing about the Carey  family's rental agreement.  Through hard work and Mr.&nbsp;Poppem's continuing  generosity, the Careys fix up the house and find life in the rural Maine  town quite satisfactory.  Things become tense when their cousin Julia arrives  for an extended visit, but eventually Nancy and Julia grow from one  another's experiences and become good friends. You'll never guess what  happens when the absent landlord returns unannounced during the family's  Halloween housewarming party!One section that may sit poorly with modern audiences features Nancy and  Julia discussing how to emphasize one's femininity at the expense of hiding the real you--an indication of how much American thinking has changed in a  relatively short period of time.  Nevertheless, this is a charming tale  featuring toe-tapping ragtime music, wonderful songs by Richard&nbsp;M. Sherman and Robert&nbsp;B. Sherman including \"Summer Magic\"  and \"The Ugly Bug Ball,\" and the incomparable talents of Mills and Ives.  Take a trip down memory lane and don't forget the kids. (Ages 7  and older)--Tami Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005RRG5", "0788806734", "6302271991", "6304285388", "B0000022WA", "B00005JN0Q", "6302271967", "6304675143", "6304293925", "6303998046", "B00000623Y", "B00005RRG3", "B00005RRGB", "B00000F6D1", "B00000ICHA", "6301390725", "B00005RRG6", "078881172X", "630440123X", "6300274268", "6302447704", "6303534422", "6300275663", "0788806742", "6304500726", "6304500718", "6304675151", "6305807671", "6303315607", "6304291698", "6304400810", "B000063V8N", "6303212255", "6301991311", "6302227151", "0764005634", "6305942285", "078880720X"], "bought_together": ["B00005RRG5", "0788806734"], "also_viewed": ["0788806734", "B00005RRG5", "B00005RRG6", "B008H6GHJM", "B0000022WA", "6304675151", "B000055ZJP", "B0009X75QU", "6304501153", "B00007GZZW", "6304285388", "630440123X", "B00004R99I", "B00004R99N", "6302787068", "6300275310", "6304675143", "630339860X", "6304401132", "078881141X", "B00005JLJC", "B0000AQZYM", "B00005RRG9", "B0001I55R4", "B0007Z9QYY", "B00000623Y", "B0019ESNGE", "6304400551", "B00005RRG3", "6301752627", "6303314015", "6304978286", "0788805533", "6305229449", "6301991311", "6303983812", "6303929338", "6302961572", "6304401248", "6304400810", "6304029284", "6305177473", "B00000I0V5", "6304401256", "B00005JKDQ", "B000035Z2S", "B0007KTBIU", "6301948106", "6303534422"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 45492}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0788811207", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HM2WV2EYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Summer Magic [VHS]"}

{"description": "The come-from-behind winner of the 1981 Oscar for best picture,Chariots of Fireeither strikes you as either a cold exercise in mechanical manipulation or as a tale of true determination and inspiration. The heroes are an unlikely pair of young athletes who ran for Great Britain in the 1924 Paris Olympics: devout Protestant Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson), a divinity student whose running makes him feel closer to God, and Jewish Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross), a highly competitive Cambridge student who has to surmount the institutional hurdles of class prejudice and anti-Semitism. There's delicious support from Ian Holm (as Abrahams's coach) and John Gielgud and Lindsay Anderson as a couple of Cambridge fogies. Vangelis's soaring synthesized score, which seemed to be everywhere in the early 1980s, also won an Oscar.Chariots of Firewas the debut film of British television commercial director Hugh Hudson (Greystoke) and was produced by David Puttnam.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002HRKVS", "B000VNMMQG", "B000KX0IOA", "B000068MC2", "B000FEB9DS", "B001A4YNPI", "B0002C9D9U", "B00DX88ISM", "B000001F28", "0792843592", "B0001FR0JS", "B002VWNIBI", "1860248411", "1618430157", "B0001GH7W2", "B000EXZFCQ", "6304712936", "B00003CXBH", "B00005AUKE", "B000KJTGHO", "B000LPR6GA", "B000JLFNIY", "6305428352", "B00004W221", "B0007SWPV2", "B00CZNSGDS", "B0068FZ0GK", "1572931302", "B000EXDS4I", "B006FE83UE", "B0001US66Y", "B000056VP4", "B00371QQ5M", "B0001US8F8", "B002HK9IDQ", "B00005JKF6", "B000K144OM", "B004GJYRI2", "B004SIP7F8", "B000RPCK2E", "B00011D1OU", "0783225733", "B006TTC5B8", "B00BTYJYR6", "B0009S4IKQ", "B004K6FS5W", "B00AMSM9CW", "6305144168", "B000XJD34I", "B0006GAO5Y", "B0071PT92C", "B000JJ5G24", "B003LMPKSQ", "B002VECM6S", "B000BCKFSE", "B000MNOX94", "B003WLVHFQ", "B002NZK5UK", "B0002JAP5E", "0060137428", "B00B0LKT9U", "B000CEXEWA", "B007N31YH0", "B0072GPQNG", "B009NNM9OA", "B001MVYUPC", "B001GWUHNQ", "B00005JPBO", "B0045HCIXG", "B005SYZYYK", "B00HUFCKB0", "B000FTCLSA", "B0006FYOTC", "B0000JBALO", "B00006ADD5", "B000BITV92", "B00AEBB9QY", "B00003CXBU", "B00004XPPC", "B0050FXDDQ", "B00EV4EUT8", "B00005AUKB", "6304907729", "B000BMY2LK", "0618562095", "1563713942", "B00066FBQG", "B002VWNIAY", "0783240171", "0440011493", "B000URDCC6"], "bought_together": ["B000VNMMQG", "B0002HRKVS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001A4YNPI", "B00DX88ISM", "B000068MC2", "B000VNMMQG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 56263}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "Warner", "asin": "0790731010", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513WMCSN21L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Chariots of Fire"}
{"description": "Martin Scorsese's 1990 masterpieceGoodFellasimmortalizes the hilarious, horrifying life of actual gangster Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), from his teen years on the streets of New York to his anonymous exile under the Witness Protection Program. The director's kinetic style is perfect for recounting Hill's ruthless rise to power in the 1950s as well as his drugged-out fall in the late 1970s; in fact, no one has ever rendered the mental dislocation of cocaine better than Scorsese. Scorsese uses period music perfectly, not just to summon a particular time but to set a precise mood.GoodFellasis at least as good asThe Godfatherwithout being in the least derivative of it. Joe Pesci's psycho improvisation of Mobster Tommy DeVito ignited Pesci as a star, Lorraine Bracco scores the performance of her life as the love of Hill's life, and every supporting role, from Paul Sorvino to Robert De Niro, is a miracle.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000C20VPA", "B000C20VRS", "B008R65XYC", "B000M341QE", "B0018CMJSU", "B0019L770A", "B0019L21GA", "B00004XPPB", "B000P0J0AG", "B0000DI87S", "B000P0J0EW", "B00003CXWV", "B00CCMKPO0", "B00G1C2URC", "B00004U103", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004SIP95G", "B002CPMB9O", "B0019L21H4", "B007TBIUSM", "B000286RP2", "B00011CZRE", "B004SIP8ZM", "B0006GAOJA", "B002T9H2LA", "B006TTC5HC", "B002VWNIEA", "0767830555", "B0000AMJEK", "B0000AM6JI", "B00005V9HH", "B004FQX5B6", "B000SFOW8I", "B00008975Z", "B002CA68N4", "6305313687", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00013RC2U", "0792174909", "B007D0FVRM", "B000A7DVR2", "B004G7XCRQ", "B002QEHPQU", "B003ASLJO0", "B000LP6KNU", "B000H5TH20", "B000P0J09C", "6305263248", "0783229526", "B00009W5CA", "B001C0I61M", "B000EHSVRI", "B00IEK9U0E", "B002ZG980U", "B004SIP7TE", "B004SIP7ZS", "B0006GAO5Y", "B00B0U2SFE", "B000ERVKBC", "B000A2UBN4", "B002AF4Y9G", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B0000714BS", "B000E5KQHI", "B00005JA8B", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B003AWRMCE", "B000P0J0EM", "1558908390", "B00080ZG10", "0767802519", "B003ELKNH2", "B003BV8I3Q", "B000035Z5G", "B00AEFXDO6", "B000E8NRBC", "B00000JGHV", "B00004RJ71", "B00AEBB9CS", "B004SIP93S", "B00AEFYSEA", "B004SIP6WW", "B003ASLJQS", "B0001Z4OXS", "B002VWNIDG", "0783225946", "B00AEBB9ZK", "B00AEFXXMI", "B0000A02TZ", "B000MZHW40", "B004SIP6GI", "B002ZG99N6", "B00AEBB95K", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00BB67UNW", "B00029RTAI", "B000P0J0D8", "B003ASLJOU", "B000Z8GZYW", "B003ASLJS6"], "bought_together": ["B000C20VPA", "B000C20VRS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000M341QE", "B0018CMJSU", "B000P0J0EW", "B00BCB1JJW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 120285}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.49, "brand": "WARNER STUDIOS", "asin": "0790729725", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YHNBJW24L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "GoodFellas"}
{"description": "Twisterwas a mega-million-dollar blockbuster--helmed by a director (Dutchman Jan de Bont) hot off another scorcher hit (Speed)--that flaunted state-of-the-art digital effects and featured a popular leading actress (Helen Hunt) who would win an Academy Award for her next film (As Good As It Gets). But ask anybody who's seen it and they'll tell you who the real star ofTwisteris: the cow. Not to give anything away, but the cow is one of those inspired little touches (like, say, Bronson Pinchot's career-making cameo inBeverly Hills Cop) that adds a touch of personality to a gigantic Hollywood production. The story is blown out the window after an impressive prologue in which Hunt's character, as a little girl, witnesses her daddy being sucked into a tornado. Basically, Hunt and Bill Paxton are thrill-seeking meteorologists chasing twisters in order to study them (and help warn people of them, of course) with a new technology they've developed. If you thought the Kansas tornado inThe Wizard of Ozwas every bit as scary as the Wicked Witch of the West, then this may be the movie for you.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783225547", "B00E8G5HQE", "B00008G8M4", "B0002V7OI8", "B00000G3PA", "B00005JMXX", "B000P0J0C4", "B0006GANOQ", "B002GIBVVG", "B00AEFXPSK", "6304806434", "B001OFM2TC", "B0045HCJFS", "B0057RCFQS", "0783225733", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000N4RAS8", "B000P0J09W", "6304711891", "B00004Z4WR", "B007STBUHI", "B007SPPANM", "B00E8G5HZ0", "B001OQCV2E", "B0013BM63O", "B00AEFXPMG", "B000QUCRB4", "6305236569", "B000EHSVPK", "B002GHHHKQ", "B000EGDB10", "B00026ZG10", "B000QUU4LY", "B00AEFY4CG", "0800195175", "B001LXIDW2", "0790732149", "1558908315", "B00177YA1K", "B0007PLLBU", "B00003CXFV", "B00081U7HC", "6305212112", "1603800875", "B000JYW5BE", "B0068FZ0O2", "0783235070", "B00003CXTG", "B000FO0AA6", "B000ETRA5U", "B00005JN5E", "B001LXIDVS", "B006VRRGNK", "B0068FZ0GK", "B0013FDM7E", "B00003CXSM", "B00004XPPG", "B000CEV3M8", "6304765266", "B001LXIDVI", "B000QUCQX8", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00393SG1U", "0790730979", "B00AEFXE9U", "B00AEFXXMI", "B000EHSVNW", "0767803434", "B004AOECXI", "B000GRUMPU", "B001ECDVK4", "630471193X", "B00008WFU4", "B005QW98NM", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEBB8NS", "B000SFOW8I", "B00AEFYW64", "B002NZK5V4", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B00008G6E8", "B0045HCJT4", "0783223609", "B00000IQC4", "B00005ATZT", "B00008WFU5", "B00008K76U", "B00AEFY5TI", "B0006FYOTC", "B007IUEE0C", "B00AEFY0F2", "B0002CHK1S", "0783225504", "B001CRC4DG", "B00407PO3W", "B002XUBDRY", "B0000844I8", "0800177258", "B00005JNTI"], "bought_together": ["B00008G8M4", "B00000G3PA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00634MLO0", "B00008G8M4", "B005LAIIPS", "0783225733"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 91188}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790729636", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GW5RZP9SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Twister"}
{"description": "After the critical success of 1993'sThe Secret Garden, Warner Bros. returned to the novels of Frances Hodgson Burnett to create this 1995 adaptation ofA Little Princess, which instantly ranked withThe Secret Gardenas one of the finest children's films of the 1990s. Neither film was a huge box-office success, but their quality speaks for itself, andA Little Princesshas all the ingredients of a timeless classic. A marvel of production design, the film features lavish sets built almost entirely on a studio backlot in Burbank, California. The story opens in New York just before the outbreak of World War I, when young Sara (Liesel Matthews) is enrolled in private boarding school while her father goes off to war. Under the domineering scrutiny of the school's wicked headmistress, Miss Minchen (Eleanor Bron), Sara quickly becomes popular with her schoolmates, but fate intervenes and she soon faces a stern reversal of fortune, resorting to wild flights of fancy to cope with an unexpectedly harsh reality. Rather than label her fanciful tales as escapist fantasy,A Little Princessactively encourages a child's power of imagination--a power that can be used to learn, grow, and adapt to a world that is often cruel and difficult. It's also one of the most visually beautiful films of the '90s and creates a fully detailed world within the boarding school--a place where imagination is vital to survival. A first-class production in every respect, this is one family film that should (if it's not too stuffy to say it) be considered required viewing for parents and kids alike.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CXI0", "6302914469", "0790720434", "6303998046", "B00005LL26"], "also_viewed": ["B000E0WJOG", "0788812408", "0790720434", "6305282927", "0790719029", "6303392350", "B00005RERY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 355747}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.96, "brand": "", "asin": "0790725657", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Q92C7747L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Little Princess [VHS]"}
{"description": "Falling from the Oscar-winning glory ofDances with Wolvesto the opposite end of the critical and box-office scale, Kevin Costner must have been deeply humbled when this three-hour postapocalyptic tale--his sophomore effort as a director--was greeted with a critical thrashing and tepid audience response. One of the most conspicuous flops of its decade, the 1997 release must have seemed like a sure thing on paper: a kind of futurist Western starring Costner as a charismatic drifter-turned-hero who leads the resistance against a military tyrant (Will Patton) by reviving the long-dormant postal system to reunite isolated communities in their fight for freedom. The movie bombed, but, like many audacious failures, it's got qualities that make it at least partially endearing, and its earnestness (although bordering on corny) keeps it from being entirely silly. Faint praise, perhaps, but Costner's ode to patriotism is occasionally stirring and visually impressive.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303909884", "6305171750", "0792838734", "0792133153", "6301964365"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 380436}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790736489", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21EY2KMF2PL.jpg", "title": "Postman [VHS]"}
{"description": "In a time when it seems that every other movie makes some claim to being a film noir,L.A. Confidentialis the real thing--a gritty, sordid tale of sex, scandal, betrayal, and corruption of all sorts (police, political, press--and, of course, very personal) in 1940s Hollywood. The Oscar-winning screenplay is actually based on several titles in James Ellroy's series of chronological thriller novels (including the title volume,The Big Nowhere, andWhite Jazz)--a compelling blend of L.A. history and pulp fiction that has earned it comparisons to the greatest of all Technicolor noir films,Chinatown. Kim Basinger richly deserved her Supporting Actress Oscar for her portrayal of a conflicted femme fatale; unfortunately, her male costars are so uniformly fine that they may have canceled each other out with the Academy voters: Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kevin Spacey, and James Cromwell play LAPD officers of varying stripes. Pearce's character is a particularly intriguing study in Hollywood amorality and ambition, a strait-laced &quot;hero&quot; (and son of a departmental legend) whose career goals outweigh all other moral, ethical, and legal considerations.

{"description": "Roy Del Ruth'sLady Killeris light fare, with James Cagney as a movie-theater usher who falls victim to a con game, then joins in the scam and soon is running the outfit. When one ornate caper results in a bystander getting hurt, Cagney has to hop a train two steps ahead of the law. At the other end of those train tracks is Hollywood, where he catches the eye of someone from Central Casting who thinks he'd make a good gangster type in the movies. Full-fledged stardom is only a reel change away--whereupon that old gang of his comes sniffing around. Some of this is diverting, some is just sloppy; the film gives the impression of having had different writers assigned from scene to scene. However, the satiric jabs at Hollywood are fun, and Cagney, as always, has his lyric moments.--Richard T.

{"description": "After the Oscar-winning The English Patient, writer/director Anthony Minghella attempted another tricky literary adaptation with The Talented Mr. Ripley, which features heartthrob Matt Damon cast against type as a psychopathic bisexual murderer. Tom Ripley (Damon) is a bright and charismatic sociopath who makes his way in mid-'50s New York City as a men's room attendant and sometimes pianist, though his real skill is in impersonating other people, forging handwriting, and running second-rate scams. After being mistaken for a Princeton student, Tom meets the shipping tycoon father of Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law), who has traveled to the coast of Italy, where he's living a carefree life with his father's money and his beautiful girlfriend, Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow). Dickie's father will pay Ripley 1,000 dollars plus his expenses if he can persuade Dickie to return to America. As Ripley and Dickie become friends, Tom finds himself both attracted to Dickie and envious of his life of pleasure. In time, he decides that he would rather be Dickie Greenleaf than Tom Ripley, so rather than go back to his life of poverty, Ripley impulsively murders Dickie and assumes his identity. The Talented Mr. Ripley was based on the first of a series of novels featuring Tom Ripley written by Patricia Highsmith; the story was previously filmed in 1960 as Purple Noon, with Alain Delon as Ripley.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000E33VWW", "B004SIP71M", "B0014GI6I2", "B00112S8RS", "B0013XZ2QK", "B008220DGE", "B002LVVCJY", "B00008WI9N", "B001P3SA8K", "B0060ZJ7DA", "B00018D40O", "B00AQBDU4Q", "B00003CWTI", "6305803765", "B0000BXMZ8", "B000PAAJZ6", "B00005BCK9", "B009D004TA", "B00008K7AO", "B00320J6WS", "B00000IC7G", "B002AT8KAG", "B00AEFXE9U", "B0006GW2JU", "B00GUO2SKA", "0393332144", "B00AQTY3JO", "6305781095", "B00005JMW7", "0783226845", "B00000G02H", "B00G7QPXUI", "B000M341SC", "B0060ZJ7BC", "B0009W5IMO", "B00H9KKGTO", "B000P5FH3K", "B00077BOFG", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B000HRMAPE", "B000BOH904", "B0036TGSR6", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00H9L26AA", "B004SIP7F8", "0788815490", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B004SUDQ22", "B0000VD02Y", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00562D3Y2", "B000A7DVR2", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B004SIP8W0", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00AMEZDK6", "B00005LIRC", "B000QGEB1M", "B000059XTI", "B004SIP6QI", "B000189LE2", "6305213305", "B0000640VK", "B000EQHXNW", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B001MSYH7Q", "B00D2CYU2W", "B000NIVJFY", "B00005JKN2", "B002ZG9800", "B00079Z9VO", "B00005R87R", "B000034CZA", "B00AEFYC96", "B008220DIC", "0792844807", "B004SIP73U", "B000MZHW40", "B0007UC8Y4", "B0016Q2D66", "6305065551", "B0045HCJ8K", "B00006RCNY", "B0010X8NF0", "B0001DCYUU", "6305781052", "B00005V5NU", "B0012OX7EO", "B000P0J0D8", "B00008G7UL", "6305428239", "0792846443", "B0045O2PHS", "6304696515", "B000F1IQN2", "B00GM7STPI", "B00AEFY8MM", "B00003CWRX"], "bought_together": ["B000E33VWW", "B004SIP71M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00JAQJMJ0", "0783225903", "B002ZG97RE", "B009D004TA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 52816}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.79, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "0792165020", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516X8NQJ30L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Talented Mr. Ripley"}
{"description": "When the theatrical release of James Cameron'sTitanicwas delayed from July to December of 1997, media pundits speculated that Cameron's $200&nbsp;million disaster epic would cause the director's downfall, signal the end of the blockbuster era, and sink Paramount Studios as quickly as the ill-fated luxury liner had sunk on that fateful night of April&nbsp;14, 1912. Some studio executives were confident, others horrified, but the clarity of hindsight turned Cameron into an Oscar-winning genius, a shrewd businessman, and one of the most successful directors in the history of motion pictures.Titanicwould surpass the $1&nbsp;billion mark in global box-office receipts (largely due to multiple viewings, the majority by teenage girls), win 11&nbsp;Academy Awards including best picture and director, produce the best-selling movie soundtrack of all time, and make a global superstar of Leonardo DiCaprio. A bona fide pop-cultural phenomenon, the film has all the ingredients of a blockbuster (romance, passion, luxury, grand scale, a snidely villain, and an epic, life-threatening crisis), but Cameron's alchemy of these ingredients proved more popular than anyone could have predicted. His stroke of genius was to combine absolute authenticity with a pair of fictional lovers whose tragic fate would draw viewers into the heart-wrenching reality of theTitanicdisaster. As starving artist Jack Dawson and soon-to-be-married socialite Rose DeWitt Bukater, DiCaprio and Kate Winslet won the hearts of viewers around the world, and their brief but never-forgotten love affair provides the humanity that Cameron needed to turnTitanicinto an emotional experience. Present-day framing scenes (featuring Gloria Stuart as the 101-year-old Rose) add additional resonance to the story, and although some viewers proved vehemently immune to Cameron's manipulations, few can deny the production's impressive achievements. Although some of the computer-generated visual effects look artificial, others--such as the sunset silhouette ofTitanicduring its first evening at sea, or the climactic splitting of the ship's sinking hull--are state-of-the-art marvels. In terms of sets and costumes alone, the film is never less than astounding. More than anything else, however, the film's overwhelming popularity speaks for itself.Titanicis an event film and a monument to Cameron's risk-taking audacity, blending the tragic irony of theTitanicdisaster with just enough narrative invention to give the historical event its fullest and most timeless dramatic impact.Titanicis an epic love story on par withGone with the Wind, and like that earlier box-office phenomenon, it's a film for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305123616", "6304117752", "6301792734", "6303215734", "B00000JS61", "6304178352", "6303396623", "6303314015", "B00003CXTF", "0769403468", "6301734734", "6302936381", "6303300480", "6305368139", "B00005RRG3", "6302610702", "0792839846", "6300207919", "B000P0J0C4", "6304546262", "B000056BRF", "6304400551", "6303101267", "630150528X", "6303637574", "B000P0J0EW", "6305126062", "6302935148", "0800199421", "6304681496", "0792116887", "6301963911", "B0000DCGT1", "B00001IVED", "6305169187", "B00006RCST", "6300216721", "630197879X", "0800113055", "076780922X", "080010367X", "0800141326", "0800184319", "6304039522", "B000066AXC"], "bought_together": ["6305123616"], "also_viewed": ["B009VQHDSQ", "6303314015", "B0074JODXU", "B00003CXTF", "B003JQZXWW", "6302787068", "6301796535", "0788812807", "0788806270", "B00005JKDQ", "6304500831", "6305229449", "6304117752", "6300213668", "6304089767", "B0000AQZYM", "079213690X", "6303049079", "6305123616", "6303402348", "6301792734", "0788812408", "B00079HZSE", "B000035Z2S", "B00000K3AN", "0788805843", "6302526574", "B0000029YC", "6303534422", "6303215734", "B0070285YE", "B00008LDO9", "0783216084", "6304434340", "B00BBND56G", "0788805533", "6300183211", "6302320402", "6305750750", "B0002CHI3S", "0790748266", "6304143184", "B0000040CM", "B005X7H9SQ", "B00004RFHF", "B00005V1Z7", "6302814782", "6301572688", "B00000JS61", "B008SLUWZG", "6303257844", "B00078XGO2", "0790736039", "B0000040EJ", "B000065U6Q", "B00003CX7L", "B00000ADKZ", "6300263673", "6302178924"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 65950}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.47, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "0792151712", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21BAWEVBJ1L.jpg", "title": "Titanic [VHS]"}
{"description": "Martin Scorsese's brutal black-and-white biography of self-destructive boxer Jake LaMotta was chosen as the best film of the 1980s in a major critics' poll at the end of the decade, and it's a knockout piece of filmmaking. Robert De Niro plays LaMotta (famously putting on 50 pounds for the later scenes), a man tormented by demons he doesn't understand and prone to uncontrollably violent temper tantrums and fits of irrational jealousy. He marries a striking young blond (Cathy Moriarty), his sexual ideal, and then terrorizes her with never-ending accusations of infidelity. Jake is as frightening as he is pathetic, unable to control or comprehend the baser instincts that periodically, and without warning, turn him into the rampaging beast of the title. But as Roman Catholic Scorsese sees it, he works off his sins in the boxing ring, where his greatest athletic talent is his ability to withstand punishment.

{"description": "The first, and only, X-rated film to win a best picture Academy Award, John Schlesinger'sMidnight Cowboyseems a lot less daring today (and has been reclassified as an R), but remains a fascinating time capsule of late-1960s sexual decadence in mainstream American cinema. In a career-making performance, Jon Voight plays Joe Buck, a naive Texas dishwasher who goes to the big city (New York) to make his fortune as a sexual hustler. Although enthusiastic about selling himself to rich ladies for stud services, he quickly finds it hard to make a living and eventually crashes in a seedy dump with a crippled petty thief named Ratzo Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman, doing one of his more effective &quot;stupid acting tricks,&quot; with a limp and a high-pitch rasp of a voice). Schlesinger's quick-cut, semi-psychedelic style has dated severely, as has his ruthlessly cynical approach to almost everybody but the lead characters. But at its heart the movie is a sad tale of friendship between a couple of losers lost in the big city, and with an ending no studio would approve today. It's a bit like an urbanOf Mice and Men, but where both guys are Lenny.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00079Z9VO", "0767830555", "B0006GANN2", "B000XJD34I", "B000022TSY", "B000RTB0R6", "B006TTC5HC", "B0010AN7Z4", "B0006GAOJA", "B004FQX5B6", "B00003CXBU", "6304907729", "B00005MEOU", "B00005M2CO", "B00AEFXN9G", "B0000549B1", "B0008ENHUI", "B0009S4IKQ", "B00005JKF6", "B003ELKNH2", "B000CNESTE", "B000ZM1MG4", "B00005AUKE", "B000BYA4HE", "B00006RCO2", "B00004XPPC", "B0006HBV3W", "B00011D1OK", "B00066FBQG", "B0002KPHZG", "B000BITV92", "B0010YVCI4", "B00AEFYSWM", "B000CEXEWA", "B000LPR6GA", "B0000YEEGM", "B00003CXB5", "B0001US8F8", "B000ZM1MGE", "0780021312", "B000CNESU8", "B0050FXDDQ", "B001EOQCMG", "B00006RCO1", "B00AATV07S", "B00782O7IY", "B00004TVUD", "B002VWNIBI", "0767827902", "076781326X", "B0049985XW", "0783240171", "B00012FXJ0", "B0087ZG7OI", "B0019L21GA", "B001GUYAZY", "6305918880", "B000EHSVS2", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B00000DQWS", "B00011D1OU", "B00002VWE0", "B00006RCO3", "B004SIP7F8", "B00AEFY6DI", "6304712936", "B003INBNOS", "B00AEBB95K", "B004L9GMBC", "079284646X", "B00AEBB9FA", "B003ZEQMH8", "B00AEBB89C", "B000LP6KNU", "B0019UGYK0", "B001D8W7EU", "B006FE83UE", "B000KJTGHO", "0792846109", "B0088XQBXQ", "B0087ZG7R0", "B007N31YH0", "B003O7I6SE", "B00AEFZDNA", "B000055Y0X", "B0019L770A", "B003LMPKSQ", "B000UJ48SQ", "B009NYF2GQ", "B000KX0IOA", "B004SIP9U6", "B00006ADD5", "B0045HCJTO", "0792838408", "B0045HCJ94", "B0045HCJ8U", "B000P0J09M", "B002VWNIAY", "B00008RH3J", "B005KQVE1S"], "bought_together": ["B00079Z9VO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004FQX5B6", "B006TTC5HC", "B0006GANN2", "B0000YEEGM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 4113}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "MGM", "asin": "0792833287", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C3ME80X6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Midnight Cowboy"}
{"description": "The history of film comedy would have been much altered if Peter Ustinov had stayed in the role of Jacques Clouseau, the bumbling French police inspector inThe Pink Panther. But Ustinov dropped out, the role went to Peter Sellers, and a classic character was born: suspicious, blundering, with a pompous little mustache and a sometimes impenetrable accent, Clouseau was always one step behind everybody else in the room.The Pink Pantherintroduced Clouseau hot on the trail of a famous jewel thief (David Niven), who may be planning to make off with an expensive gem known as the Pink Panther. Set in a European ski resort, this bubbly comedy is a wonderful dose of '60s style, from the famous Henry Mancini theme music to the presence of two of Europe's top sex symbols of the era, Claudia Cardinale and Capucine. The film also introduced the popular cartoon Pink Panther, slinking around to Mancini's music in an animated credits sequence. The film's success brought a follow-up,A Shot in the Dark, also released in 1964; after 11 years, Sellers and top comedy director Blake Edwards (10) returned with three more sequels.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301976835", "0792834895", "6302884438", "0792834852", "6301969413", "6300267938", "B00000JS61"], "bought_together": ["6301976835", "0792834895"], "also_viewed": ["B0001AG01M", "0792834895", "6302884438", "0792834852", "0792835573"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 210456}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0792834879", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5198FSYC2ML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Pink Panther [VHS]"}
{"description": "What a combo! Tobe Hooper, the director ofThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre, teamed up with family-oriented producer Steven Spielberg to makePoltergeist. The film is about a haunted suburban tract home in a development very much like the Arizona one in which Spielberg was raised. (Because it came out the same summer as Spielberg'sE.T., it was tempting to see both movies as representing Spielberg's ambivalent feelings about childhood in suburbia. One was a fantasy, the other a nightmare.)  Spielberg also cowrote the screenplay, which taps into primal, childlike fears of monsters under the bed, monsters in the closet, sinister clown faces, and all manner of things that go bump in the night. At first, some of the odd happenings in the house are kind of funny and amusing, but they grow gradually creepier until the film climaxes in a terrifying special-effects extravaganza when 5-year-old Carole Anne (Heather O'Rourke) is kidnapped by the spooks and held hostage in another dimension. Though not nearly as frightening as Hooper's magnum opus, or the originalA Nightmare on Elm Street, which came along two years later,Poltergeistis one of the smartest and most entertaining horror pictures of its time.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00009PY4G", "B00006FDCD", "B00AEFYYH6", "B007STBUHI", "B004SIP92O", "B00004BZIY", "B000VECAD0", "B00000IQC4", "B00005A8XX", "B004LWZW24", "B001B1872U", "B009XTF8KQ", "B00386EZUY", "B000HCO86I", "B00005JOJE", "B0087F7VSY", "B001D2WU9I", "B000PMLJMQ", "B000067FP8", "B000E1P2EY", "B003PIUINI", "B0009X763M", "B000WC3864", "B003UN0752", "B002I41KNC", "B0021L8UFI", "B005GT3X68", "B000P0J0A6", "B0087ZG7PW", "B00AIBZLVY", "B0045HCJJE", "B000ASATZ8", "B0000VCZK2", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00005JNTI", "B000E33W1W", "B00008LUNW", "B00AEBBA2W", "B000CCBC9O", "B0006SGYL0", "B000FAOC2W", "B00008WFU4", "B000OA8OK4", "B00005JNNT", "B001AGXEAG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004TDTO", "B00004BZIY", "B000VECAD0", "B00006FDCD"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 69740}, "asin": "0792833201", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31ZsC3YTJ5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Poltergeist"}

{"description": "There are two great husband-wife teams (one on-screen, the other off) involved in this classic 1949 comedy. Not only do Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy throw comedic sparks as a married team of lawyers on opposing sides of a high-profile case, but their exquisite verbal jousting was scripted by the outstanding team of Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon. Leading all of this stellar talent was director George Cukor at the prime of his career. The result is one of Hollywood's greatest comedy classics, still packing a punch with its sophisticated gender politics. Arguably the best of the Tracy-Hepburn vehicles,Adam's Ribshows the stars at their finest in roles that not only made their off-screen love so entertainingly obvious, but also defined their timeless screen personas--she the intelligent, savvy, rebellious woman ahead of her time, he the easygoing but obstinate modern man who can't help but love her.

{"description": "Although it lacks the creepy subtleties of Stephen King's celebrated  novel, George Romero's underrated adaptation ofThe Dark Halfranks among  the best films based on King's fiction, with Romero taking care to honor King's  central theme while serving up some gruesome gore in the film's much-criticized  finale. Inspired by King's own admission that he wrote several novels under the  pseudonym Richard Bachman,The Dark Halfexplores the duality of a  writer's impulse, ranging from literary respectability to the viscerally  cathartic thrills of exploitative pulp fiction.Author and teacher Thad Beaumont (Timothy Hutton) finds himself torn between  those extremes when he \"kills\" his profitable, pseudonymous alter ego George  Stark (the bestselling \"dark half\" to Thad's light), who then assumes an evil,  autonomous form (again played by Hutton) to lethally defend his role in Thad's  creative endeavors. Forced to wrestle with this evil manifestation of his own  unformed twin, Thad must fight to protect his wife (Amy Madigan), their twin  babies, and his own survival as an artist. Romero skillfully develops the  twin/duality theme to explore the writer's dilemma, and Hutton is outstanding in  his dual roles, playing Stark (in subtly fiendish makeup) as a redneck rebel  with a knack for slashing throats. Julie Harris adds class in a supporting role,  and horror fans will relish Romero's climactic showdown, in which swarms of  sparrows seal Stark's fate. It favors a pulp sensibility with clunky exposition  to explain Stark's existence, butThe Dark Halfis a laudable effort from  everyone involved.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000068IES", "B000G1R39E", "B006J8NPAE", "B00005UQ9V", "6305645574", "B0001FVDQ4", "B00AEBB91O", "0767821599", "B000053UIF", "B000GYI340", "B0007WFXNA", "6305120021", "B00000F3SB", "B00AEBB91E", "B00005O439", "B00AEFXR8I", "B00006FDCU", "B0000C2IQQ", "630523650X", "B0002OXVG4", "B000U1ZV6W", "B00BW4S87U", "0792846443", "B00A1AU72A", "B0010X73ZG", "1573625779", "B00BTYPW7C", "B0007NFMB2", "B0002A2VK0", "B0053TWVDC", "B000063US5", "B0002O7XW2", "B00005LQ0Q", "B00BW4S8AC", "B0053TWV46", "B00AEFYV9W", "B00AKGG828", "B000GBEWRU", "B00BW4S89S", "B00030AZCK", "B00005K3NR", "0790742829", "B002NZK5SM", "B00KW3A6KE", "B00LBFFR2Y", "B0033HKCV4", "B000TJ6PBK", "B00006FDCD", "B008QE9Z8A", "B0084MVE7E", "1573626910", "6304604572", "B002GHHHG0", "B003L2M584", "B0002234LS", "6304936397", "B000069I05", "B000077VRT", "B000RZIGUE", "B00JJOY45U", "B00IYJRIKO", "B00APQLJTA", "B000N2HD6Y", "B002KH4KSY", "B00003CXIP", "B002VWNIDG", "B00JJOY496", "B000P0J0EM", "1573623911", "B0052XU4BK", "078062856X", "B00009QG7O", "B00JJOY47I", "B00DII0MGI", "B00K1L4NBU", "B002AMVEII", "B000085EER", "B000UVKHNY", "B00005NQGM", "B00HRUQ7WG", "B005CFBZVG", "0792841336", "B0029EW7BA", "B004FUPK6U", "B00HRUQ8X4", "B0002S94BQ", "B00KDU8HQQ", "0792842960", "B00A1AU702", "B00302QF72", "B00005N5RM", "B00DOZNGTK", "B0084MVDUM", "B002WDR4AC", "B00HRUQB8Q", "B00GJ7CUFG", "B00D97DMBU", "B00003L9CQ"], "bought_together": ["B000068IES"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00009OWI3", "B006J8NPAE", "B00000F3SB", "B00BW4S8AC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 34095}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.96, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "0792841328", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517RCFE3MHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Dark Half"}

{"description": "One of John Ford's earliest talkies,Arrowsmithdemonstrates the director's underrated knack for contemporary drama. Adapted (by acclaimed screenwriter Sidney Howard) from the novel by Sinclair Lewis, the film is a prestigious vehicle for Ronald Colman in the title role of Martin Arrowsmith, a promising physician whose research ambitions are curtailed when he improbably marries the adoring but comparably dim-witted nurse Leora (Helen Hayes), who relocates him to her South Dakota home and convinces him to be a country doctor. Unchallenged and unhappy, he readily accepts an offer to battle bubonic plague in the British West Indies, where he encounters both triumph and tragedy. Creaky logic and primitive sound quality don't stop Ford from crafting some still-impressive sequences (the island sequences prepared Ford for 1937'sThe Hurricane), and the theme of marriage-vs.-career remains timelessly relevant. Though not as powerful as the Lewis-basedDodsworth(1936),Arrowsmithis that later film's worthy companion.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303391915", "6301976215", "6301978536"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 620463}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.94, "brand": "", "asin": "0792845854", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5173MSYYGQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Arrowsmith [VHS]"}

{"description": "Remember the outfit Cher wore to the Oscars when she won an Academy Award for her performance in this 1987 film? Ay-yi-yi. The actress' more retiring character in this infectious comedy leaps several psychological hurdles just giving her hair a permanent. But then the original screenplay by John Patrick Shanley (Joe Versus the Volcano) is a wonderful, gently satirical tale of an Italian-American family dealing with repression and dissatisfaction against a backdrop of cultural expectations. Cher is focused and funny as a widow who feels she should marry an older fellow (Danny Aiello), but then falls for his black-sheep brother (Nicolas Cage). Olympia Dukakis and Vincent Gardenia are perfect as her parents, and John Mahoney (of TV'sFrasier) has a memorable, small role as a middle-aged man on the make who gets a lecture from Dukakis's character. Shanley's dialogue is comically stylized in a way that makes one appreciate how much words can inform an actor's performance. Taking its cues from him and director Norman Jewison (And Justice for All), the cast immerse themselves in a pool of hilariously operatic emotion.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000542C7", "B000JU8H9C", "B00006FMUW", "B00009AOBI", "630560097X", "B0045HCJ76", "B00000DR7Y", "B00008G7UF", "B000ZM1MG4", "B00C6F61HS", "6305236569", "B000YDBPAM", "B001EJW0SG", "B00DSKSZXI", "B0001AVZA8", "B0000AOV4I", "6304765266", "B002ZG976U", "B001ECDVK4", "0767810856", "B00001W9G0", "B000023VTP", "B000MQC9H4", "0684809001", "0783240171", "B0007QJ1XE", "B000FO0AA6", "B007N31YH0", "6306012419", "B005S9EJ14", "B0000VD02Y", "B002VWNIAY", "B003ASLJK4", "6305213283", "B00DDT0JB0", "B0000DIXDR", "B00079Z9VO", "078322740X", "B00AEFXYOA", "0859654842", "B000BC8STM", "B00DW5ILUG", "B00026L7PE", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B00008977F", "B000021Y7Q", "0792844831", "B00000IQW5", "B00009V7PJ", "B00AEFY0F2", "6305133468", "B00005JG6N", "B0001Z3632", "B00004TJKK", "B00005JL3T", "0783229364", "B004SIP6BI", "B00015YVD6", "B002VWNIBI", "B000083E79", "B00004T0PP", "B000VBIGD6", "6305212112", "B007G8SEUM", "B00AEFY4CG", "B0000CDRW2", "B00008NRI7", "B000JYW5B4", "B00AEBB8OC", "6304712936", "B000E6ESI0", "B005ETAM4Q", "B003BV8ICC", "B00066FBQG", "B0001CNRBG", "B00143XE1E", "B000765IJK", "0790742071", "B003LMPKSQ"], "bought_together": ["B00006FMUW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00009AOBI", "B000JU8H9C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 39509}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.46, "brand": "CHER", "asin": "0792838963", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51A3795WX3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Moonstruck"}

{"description": "After his bloody showdown with Brad Pitt's psychopathic redneck inKalifornia, David Duchovny used an off-season hiatus fromThe X-Filesto star in this 1997 thriller, in which he plays a doctor whose fall from professional grace leads to a dangerous career in the criminal underworld. Having lost his license after drug abuse caused him to lose a patient during surgery, he's recruited into his illegal career by a slimy but charismatic millionaire (Timothy Hutton) whose associates have a way of getting shot all the time. Before long, Duchovny comes to realize the extent of Hutton's evil, and he finds himself caught in a criminal trap that also involves an alluring femme fatale (Angelina Jolie) and a Faustian bargain that could cost him his life. The plot's rather absurd and fairly predictable, but fine performances by Duchovny and especially Hutton (who makes a memorable screen villain) make this stylish thriller intriguingly worthwhile. The DVD includes the original theatrical trailer.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006Z2LKQ", "B0000V492Y", "6305047456", "B0000ZG072", "B000274TJ4", "B001TK80CK", "B000G2YCVA", "B001HVZOB6", "B00462NFUA", "B001BSBC16", "6305821216", "B000GRUMSC", "B00BTYU3W6", "B000H0M3X0", "B00BTYNXJG", "B0050UEVNM", "B00003CWQR", "B00003CXZ4", "B000G6BLHY", "B0002S94BQ", "B003EYVXOQ", "0792846435", "B000QUCNOA", "B000U1ZV76", "B000MXPE7O", "B0006IIPIK", "B00AEFYGBA", "B0024FADD8", "B00000G3I2", "B004EPYZUS", "B00004Z4WR", "B004T0XYKA", "B0000CBY1C", "B006G4LKQW", "B0073JF2WC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000V492Y", "B00803PFZO", "B008XAT1LS", "B0050UEVNM"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 105525}, "asin": "1558908439", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71NWN1HWRZL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Playing God"}
{"description": "The surprising truth about Disney's 1982 computer-game fantasy is that it's still visually impressive (though technologically quaint by later high-definition standards) and a lot of fun. It's about a computer wizard named Flynn (Jeff Bridges) who is digitally broken down into a data stream by a villainous software pirate (David Warner) and reconstituted into the internal, 3-D graphical world of computers. It is there, in the blazingly colorful, geometrically intense landscapes of cyberspace, that Flynn joins forces with Tron (Bruce Boxleitner) to outmaneuver the Master Control program that holds them captive in the equivalent of a gigantic, infinitely challenging computer game. Disney's wizards used a variety of cinematic techniques and early-'80s state-of-the-art computer-generated graphics to accomplish their dynamic visual goals, and the result was a milestone in cyberentertainment, catering to technogeeks while providing a dazzling adventure for hackers and nonhackers alike. Appearing just in time to celebrate the nascent cyberpunk movement in science fiction,Tronreceived a decidedly mixed reaction when originally released, but has since become a high-tech favorite and a landmark in special effects, with a loyal following of fans. DVD is a perfect format for the movie's neon-glow color scheme, and the musical score by synthesizer pioneer Wendy Carlos is faithfully preserved on the digitally remastered soundtrack.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002ZG99QS", "B0001I55SS", "B004K4IZ3G", "B008R65XN8", "B0024FADAQ", "B0015NORDW", "B0037KMHRY", "B003TEI3E4", "B0013LL2Z2", "B0030MOTNE", "B008JFUS0U", "B008JFUO72", "B006ZOFX7K", "6305047456", "142313463X", "B0045HCJ9O", "B0039MIPDA", "0783226063", "B002GHHHOM", "B00008OE4W", "B0090SI56Y", "B0001I562I", "B000056WR3", "B0045HCJKS", "B0042YXWUK", "B004VT9JLM", "B003RACGZM", "B000P0J06K", "B005LAIH2W", "B002HWRYJE", "B002SR6CIM", "B0038OMQPW", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B0038ZITIE", "B006VRRGNK", "B00K7IPFSM", "B0001Z37HM", "B004M20YDU", "B004J1P5RE", "B00AEFXT7W", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000VECAD0", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00005PJ6N", "B0030MOXA8", "B00E5I2M9K", "B0002J58GU", "B001PPLIEG", "B001O4KBPA", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000QXDCJ2", "B0038OMQNY", "B00005PJ6M", "B004LWZW42", "6305428514", "B00005JKFR", "B008JFUO36", "B00005JKU0", "B008JFUQZ2", "630469654X", "B00005JKEX", "B005LAII3A", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00005AB62", "B000HEVZ9E", "B001AGXEAG", "B00JPS7HOA", "B001FB55HQ", "B004L9GMBC", "B002GHHHKQ", "B001MWUWU8", "B00006JC48", "B005COPWZW", "B000SUKPL6", "B00000JPH6", "B004LWZWFQ"], "bought_together": ["B002ZG99QS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002ZG99QS", "B004OBQQRW", "B0044XV3R8", "B00I6JOD2S"]}, "price": 14.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 226749}, "asin": "1558908358", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GQ2WSNH5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tron"}

Gustavo (Ren&eacute;  Lavan) is an idealistic young Marxist scholar who dreams of attending the University of Prague. When he falls for an earthy dancer with a more pragmatic view of her homeland, who plans to escape to Florida, his ideals are systematically chipped away in the face of poverty, repression, corruption, and police brutality until it all becomes too much for him to bear. A far cry from the more romantic work of Tom&aacute;s Guti&eacuterrez; Alea (Strawberry and Chocolate), this film speaks volumes about a generation of exiles burning with anger and hate for Castro and his regime. It's also manipulative and heavy-handed, with Gustavo less a hero than a straw figure poised for a fall, and it's far less revealing than such self-critical Cuban features asPortrait of TeresaandMemories of Underdevelopment. But its vivid and passionate feelings of betrayal can hardly be dismissed. Ichaso shot portions of the film in Cuba and smuggled the footage out, but Santo Domingo doubles for Havana through the bulk of the feature.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 558295}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.98, "brand": "", "asin": "1567301312", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R8WVQVM5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bitter Sugar [VHS]"}
{"description": "Outside of devoted cult audiences, many Americans have yet to discover the extremely stylish, relentlessly terrifying Italian horror genre, or the films of its talented virtuoso, Dario Argento.Suspiria, part one of a still-uncompleted trilogy (the luminously emptyInfernowas the second), is considered his masterpiece by Argento devotees but also doubles as a perfect starting point for those unfamiliar with the director or his genre. The convoluted plot follows an American dancer (Jessica Harper) from her arrival at a European ballet school to her discovery that it's actually a witches coven; but, really, don't worry about that too much. Argento makes narrative subservient to technique, preferring instead to assault the senses and nervous system with mood, atmosphere, illusory gore, garish set production, a menacing camera, and perhaps the creepiest score ever created for a movie. It's essentially a series of effectively unsettling set pieces--a raging storm that Harper should have taken for an omen, and a blind man attacked by his own dog are just two examples--strung together on a skeleton structure.

For those new to the Marx Brothers, this is the perfect introduction to Groucho, Chico, and Harpo (and even Zeppo), three of the funniest men to ever grace the screen. Rufus T.

When the leader of the neighboring Sylvania decides he's in love with Mrs. Teasdale, Firefly declares war. The movie, from 1933, is tremendously satirical, a play on politics and war.

{"description": "When Universal Pictures picked up the movie rights to a Broadway adaptation ofDracula, they felt secure in handing the property over to the sinister team of actor Lon Chaney and director Tod Browning. But Chaney died of cancer, and Universal hired the Hungarian who had scored a success in the stage play: B&eacute;la Lugosi. The resulting film launched both Lugosi's baroque career and the horror-movie cycle of the 1930s. It gets off to an atmospheric start, as we meet Count Dracula in his shadowy castle in Transylvania, superbly captured by the great cinematographer Karl Freund. Eventually Dracula and his blood-sucking devotee (Dwight Frye, in one of the cinema's truly mad performances) meet their match in a vampire-hunter called Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan). If the later sections of the film are undeniably stage bound and a tad creaky, Dracula nevertheless casts a spell, thanks to Lugosi's creepily lugubrious manner and the eerie silences of Browning's directing style. (After a mood-enhancing snippet ofSwan Lakeunder the opening titles, there is no music in the film.)Frankenstein, which was released a few months later, confirmed the horror craze, and Universal has been making money (and countless spin-off projects) from its twin titans of terror ever since. Certainly the role left a lasting impression on the increasingly addled and drug-addicted Lugosi, who was never quite able to distance himself from the part that made him a star. He was buried, at his request, in his black vampire cape.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300183084", "6300181286", "6300183092", "6300183629", "6302120101", "630252542X", "6302843219", "6300185443", "6302526167", "6301005783", "6301257014", "6302841771", "6302526175", "6303257801", "6302841763", "6302843227", "6300185281", "6300181820", "630284178X", "0783235607", "6302526191", "6302526140", "6302841844", "6300181340", "6301967410", "0783222955", "6302526086", "630018529X", "6304507348", "6302526051", "B00007JME0", "0783240961", "B00AEBB8VK", "630252587X", "6302526094", "6300247589", "B002VWNIAY", "6303626424", "6302843200", "6305576173", "630266232X", "6301327845", "6300215539", "6303402070", "6300182983", "6302309751", "5554306004", "6302841798", "0790705141", "630214227X", "630281474X"], "bought_together": ["6300181286", "6300183092"], "also_viewed": ["6300181286", "6300183629", "6300183092", "6300183084", "6302526175", "6300185281", "6302843219", "630252542X", "6302526140", "6302120101", "B00L8QP0VY", "6302843197", "630018529X", "6302526086", "6302841763", "630252587X", "6302841771", "6302526167", "6300185443", "B00000JMOF", "B00000K14A", "630312917X", "6302843200", "6300214087", "B0001HAGTM", "B008FL8OTK", "B000WNHTCC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 228201}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6300181278", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51588FFRK0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dracula [VHS]"}
{"description": "An experimental film masquerading as a standard Hollywood thriller. The plot ofRopeis simple and based on a successful stage play: two young men (John Dall and Farley Granger) commit murder, more or less as an intellectual exercise. They hide the body in their large apartment, then throw a dinner party. Will the body be discovered? Director Alfred Hitchcock, fascinated by the possibilities of the long-take style, decided to shoot this story as though it were happening in one long, uninterrupted shot. Since the camera can only hold one 10-minute reel at a time, Hitchcock had to be creative when it came time to change reels, disguising the switches as the camera passed behind someone's back or moved behind a lamp. In later years Hitchcock wrote off the approach as misguided, andRopemay not be one of Hitchcock's top movies, but it's still a nail-biter. They don't call him the Master of Suspense for nothing.

{"description": "At the time of its original release in 1984, this modestly budgeted sci-fi excursion had the distinction of offering some of the first examples of purely computer-generated animation, an apt (and frugal) special-effects solution for a movie with a plot line rooted in computer games. Both the computer-generated visuals and the arcade game now look quaint, but writer-director Nick Castle's affable, good- hearted adventure holds up nicely, thanks to a clever premise--the title game is actually a test for prospective starship pilots, planted by embattled aliens under siege from an evil invader. When a restless teenager (Lance Guest) racks up an impressive score, he finds himself spirited away to the besieged planet and thrust into the midst of an intergalactic war. Apart from Castle's skill at contrasting his extraterrestrial settings with the mundane details of his hero's earthbound life, the movie gets lift-off from two thorough pros, Robert Preston, who makes the alien recruiter, Centauri, a planet-hopping cousin toThe Music Man's Harold Hill, and Dan O'Herlihy, the alien copilot, who suggests a scaly Walter Brennan.

The mystery itself is clever enough: As a former MI-5 agent, George C. Scott is lured into the case when writer Adrian Messenger (John Merivale) gives him a list of 11 names to investigate, just before Messenger is mysteriously killed. Scott combs for clues to connect the names, and the film's promotional gimmick--big-name stars disguised under Bud Westmore's expert makeup--kicks into gear.

Emmett Walsh) to follow his cheating wife (Frances McDormand in her first film appearance), and then kill her and her lover (John Getz). The gumshoe turns the tables on his client, and suddenly a bad situation gets much, much worse, with some violent goings-on that are as elemental as they are shocking. (A scene in which a character who has been buried alive suddenly emerges from his own grave instantly becomes an archetypal nightmare.) Shot by Barry Sonnenfeld before he became an A-list director in Hollywood,Blood Simpleestablished the hyperreal look and feel of the Coens' productions (undoubtedly inspired a bit by filmmaker Sam Raimi, whoseThe Evil Deadhad just been coedited by Joel). Sections of the film have proved to be an endurance test for art-house movie fans, particularly an extended climax that involves one shock after another but ends with a laugh at the absurdity of criminal ambition. This is definitely one of the triumphs of the 1980s and the American independent film scene in general.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003UESJME", "6300184064", "630347327X", "B00000J2KZ", "6302641888"], "also_viewed": ["B00553K8FY", "6304297564", "6305417806"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 358611}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.3, "brand": "", "asin": "6300184110", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JN74WN7BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blood Simple [VHS]"}

{"description": "When Samuel (Lukas Haas), a young Amish boy traveling with his mother Rachel (Kelly McGillis), witnesses the murder of a police officer in a public restroom, he and his mother become the temporary wards of John Book (Harrison Ford), a detective who's been assigned to solve the crime. After suspect lineups and mug-shot books yield nothing, Samuel, in the most memorable scene of the film, recognizes the murderer as a narcotics agent whose picture he sees in the precinct. Once Book realizes that the police chief is in on it, too, he whisks Samuel and Rachel back home to Amish country, where he himself goes into hiding as a plain Amish man. The juxtaposition between the life of the Amish and the violence of inner-city police corruption work surprisingly well for the story, and Kelly McGillis as the falling in love widow gives an almost perfect performance. Directed by Peter Weir, the film is extremely successful in drawing the viewer into its world and, accordingly, is immensely entertaining. The only thing that mars its polish is the one-dimensional, almost cartoonish handling of the upper-echelon police corruption--a subtler, more realistic treatment of this aspect of the story would have rendered the film near perfect.--James McGrath", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792116887", "B000007OY0", "6304259131", "0800125762", "6302816629", "6302238331", "6302935148", "0792133153", "6303269834", "B00000JS61", "080018789X", "630442972X", "B000003KDG", "0790743213", "6302415853", "6304071876", "079284517X", "B00005PJ8I", "6303402348", "0790748169", "6303057225", "6303637574", "6301599896", "6303942830", "B0000068ZQ", "6303020089", "6300181340", "0783235607", "6303402070", "B00007E2F6", "0790734079", "6300182479", "B00000J2L7", "6301734734", "079212569X", "6301736362", "6302909023", "0800116917", "6305126062", "6302226899", "6303696813", "6300247112", "0783226152", "B00000F5PI", "6305426678", "B000006N70", "0800132009", "6303058981", "6305012792", "B003MG6FJY", "6301976924", "5559477621", "B00005A1VH", "0783231482", "6303451462", "B000063UUP", "0792107683", "0800123506", "6304458975", "6303109950", "0790733935", "6304214502", "0792838556"], "bought_together": ["0792116887", "6302816629"], "also_viewed": ["6302380588"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 257292}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6300214567", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JAT9P45FL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Witness [VHS]"}

Director William Wyler, more at home with such heavy-going, Oscar-winning classics asThe Best Years of Our LivesandBen- Hur, doesn't always keep the champagne bubbles afloat, and the Peck role would have fit Cary Grant like a silk glove.

But it was the outrageously farcicalRaising Arizonathat announced the Coens' darkly comedic audacity to the world. It wasn't widely seen when released in 1987, but its modest audience was vocally supportive, and this hyperactive comedy has since developed a large and loyal following. It's the story of \"Ed\" (for Edwina, played by Holly Hunter), a policewoman who falls in love with \"Hi\" (for H.I. McDonnough, played by Nicolas Cage) while she's taking his mug shots. She's infertile and he's a habitual robber of convenience stores, and their folksy marital bliss depends on settling down with a rug rat. Unable to conceive, they kidnap one of the newsworthy quintuplets born to an unpainted-furniture huckster named Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson), who quickly hires a Harley-riding mercenary (Randall \"Tex\" Cobb) to track the baby's whereabouts. What follows is a full-throttle comedy that defies description, fueled by the Coens' lyrical redneck dialogue, the manic camerawork of future director Barry Sonnenfeld, and some of the most inventively comedic chase scenes ever filmed. Some will dismiss the comedy for being recklessly over-the-top; others will love it for its clever mix of slapstick action, surreal fantasy, and homespun family values. One thing's for sure--this is a Coen movie from start to finish, and that makes it undeniably unique.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790750414", "6303953425", "6301797957"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 206770}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.94, "brand": "", "asin": "6300249964", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71621XK1MRL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Raising Arizona [VHS]"}

All things considered, it's easy to see whyAn American Werewolf in Londonbecame a modern horror favorite.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302038308", "6300182878", "B0000039A6", "0792845684", "6302798450", "6300214087", "0790705141", "6301408977", "0792839234", "6304508611", "0792846311", "6301681312"], "also_viewed": ["6303265693", "6302941318"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 426451}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.79, "brand": "", "asin": "6300262731", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21NJ6PNM75L.jpg", "title": "An American Werewolf in London [VHS]"}
{"description": "Though not as successful asWhat's Up, Doc?orThe Way We  Were,Up the Sandboxsprings from the early 1970s, when Barbra  Streisand's career was in full stride. Streisand stars as Margaret, a  stay-at-home mom in the middle of New York who's feeling the strain of her narrow life.  Frustrated by her self-involved husband and the emotionally rewarding but  mentally unstimulating tasks of motherhood, she escapes into fantasies--such as  being hit on by a cross-gendered Fidel Castro, bombing the Statue of Liberty  with black militants, and having a furious catfight with her overbearing mother.  The movie's strength lies in these fantasies' slippery nature; some are over the  top, but others are so subtle you're not always sure where they start and stop,  making the portrait of Margaret's psyche intriguingly complex. Streisand fans  should check out this sleeper.--Bret Fetzer", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 653045}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.94, "brand": "", "asin": "6300270173", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41KT6498M8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Up the Sandbox [VHS]"}

{"description": "Director Francis Ford Coppola and executive producer George Lucas shared a strong desire to film the story of Preston Tucker, the man who revolutionized car design in the late 1940s, only to have his innovation squelched by the \"big three\" automakers in a legal battle between Tucker and powerful political lobbies. Coppola surely related to and sympathized with Tucker as a visionary underdog, and so this stylish, energetic film envisions \"the man and his dream\" in idealistic terms--an unabashed optimist (played by Jeff Bridges) who realizes his vision through blind faith and tenacity. Martin Landau gives a superb, heartbreaking performance as an associate who desperately wants to share Tucker's enthusiasm, but knows that corporate wolves are knocking at the door and will soon burst in with fangs bared. Joan Allen is equally good as Tucker's supportive wife, and the film's combination of dazzling costumes, production design, and the fabulous Tucker itself (of which only 50 models were made) creates an infectious atmosphere of postwar optimism. In the end, however, this fascinating film is much like Coppola himself: possessed of genius, blinded by ambition, and prone to create works of erratic brilliance. Don't take that as criticism, however; this is a sharp, underrated film about a dreamer whose dream was a worthy one, even if it only briefly came true.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300246965", "B00097E6V8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 334350}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.97, "brand": "", "asin": "6301217861", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N963ZG7HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tucker--The Man and His Dream [VHS]"}

Interestingly, what starts out as something of a technophobic exercise--Hepburn fears for her job, and a computer goes haywire--takes an abrupt turn (perhaps the IBM product placement had something to do with that).

Its intelligent script, frightening costuming, and savagely effective conclusion (which needs no big-budget special effects to augment its impact) remain both potent and relevant. When Colonel George Taylor (the fabulous Charlton Heston) crash lands his spacecraft on what seems to be an unfamiliar planet, he is captured and held prisoner by a dominant race of hyperrational, articulate apes. However, the ape community is riven with internal dissention, centered in no small part on its policy toward humans, who, on this planet, are treated as mindless animals. Befriended and ultimately assisted by the more liberal simians, Taylor escapes--only to find a more terrifying obstacle confronting his return home. Heavy-handed object lessons abound--the ubiquity of generational warfare, the inflexibility of dogma, the cruelty of prejudice--and the didactic fingerprints of Rod Serling are very much in evidence here. But director Franklin Schaffner has a dark, pop-apocalyptic sci-fi vision all his own, and time has not dulled the monumental emotional impact of the film's climactic payoff shot. If you don't know what I'm talking about here, you owe it to yourself to check out this stone classic, and even if you do, see it with fresh eyes; and don't be surprised if you get the chills all over again... and again... and again.--Miles Bethany", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301661761", "6301661710", "6304457316", "6303148352", "0783222955", "6301327845", "B00000JS61", "6304196911", "079284517X"], "bought_together": ["6301661710"], "also_viewed": ["B005FHWWXQ", "6305076146", "6301661710", "B00003CXXU", "B000K7VHHS", "B00004ZBGJ", "B000E6ESG2", "B00005KH32", "B000IJ79UW", "B00004ZBGC", "6301792734", "B001G7Q10Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 314709}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.84, "brand": "", "asin": "6301661729", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512998ZRQ3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Planet of the Apes [VHS]"}

{"description": "An affectionate homage more than a spoof of Alfred Hitchcock thrillers, Mel Brooks's hilarious movie is one of the funniest modern comedies around. Brooks plays a psychiatrist with a severe fear of heights who moves to the Bay Area to take over a psychiatric hospital after its former head mysteriously disappears. He must contend with the resident psychiatrist (Harvey Korman) and the twisted resident nurse (Cloris Leachman) as they plot against him, eventually framing him for murder. While on the run, Brooks teams up with the alluring daughter (Madeline Kahn) of the missing doctor to solve the mystery and confront his own fears.

Directed by Jerry Zucker, previously best known for codirectingAirplane!and similar broad comedies,Ghostis a careful balancing act of strong commercial elements, but at heart it is a timeless Hollywood tearjerker that easily gets under one's skin.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300263673", "6300214370", "6300213668", "B00023BLXA", "B000059XVO", "6302091632", "6300183467", "6300215814", "6304932553", "630362572X", "B000055YW4", "6302765536", "6300214753", "6301796535", "0767825411", "6300269639", "B0000048S1", "630018403X", "6301570723", "B00008FEBU", "6303402348", "630442972X", "6300214710", "B00000490M", "0784011923", "6303236863", "B00000JGEI", "B00005B6ND", "6300183181", "6305814694", "6303344224", "6302824729", "0783216084", "6302256615", "6304773366", "B00003CXE6", "B00006G8LB", "6301827732", "6302374189", "6303540082", "6305368139", "6300215695", "B00008DZ83", "B0000BWVBD", "6303637574", "B000059XY5", "079070546X", "6303123244", "6304209266", "B000R3KOWE", "6303202004", "0792116887", "B000003KLM"], "bought_together": ["6300263673", "6300214370"], "also_viewed": ["0800124693", "6301796535", "079213690X", "B00005V1Z7", "0788812408", "0792151712", "0780607287", "0788805843", "6302320402", "6301792734", "6303314015", "6300213668", "6303049079", "6300214370", "6304290888", "6305229449", "B00005JKDQ", "6304015127", "6302091632", "B00005LKL5", "B00CQRN3QI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 185556}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.47, "brand": "", "asin": "6301966988", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41D45EM50ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ghost [VHS]"}
{"description": "Annie Hallis one of the truest, most bittersweet romances on film. In it, Allen plays a thinly disguised version of himself: Alvy Singer, a successful--if neurotic--television comedian living in Manhattan. Annie (the wholesomely luminous Dianne Keaton) is a Midwestern transplant who dabbles in photography and sings in small clubs. When the two meet, the sparks are immediate--if repressed. Alone in her apartment for the first time, Alvy and Annie navigate a minefield of self-conscious \"is-this-person-someone-I'd-want-to-get-involved-with?\" conversation. As they speak, subtitles flash their unspoken thoughts: the likes of \"I'm not smart enough for him\" and \"I sound like a jerk.\" Despite all their caution, they connect, and we're swept up in the flush of their new romance. Allen's antic sensibility shines here in a series of flashbacks to Alvy's childhood, growing up, quite literally, under a rumbling roller coaster. His boisterous Jewish family's dinner table shares a split screen with the WASP-y Hall's tight-lipped holiday table, one Alvy has joined for the first time. His position as outsider is uncontestable he looks down the table and sizes up Annie's \"Grammy Hall\" as \"a classic Jew-hater.\"The relationship arcs, as does Annie's growing desire for independence. It quickly becomes clear that the two are on separate tracks, as what was once endearing becomes annoying.Annie Hallembraces Allen's central themes--his love affair with New York (and hatred of Los Angeles), how impossible relationships are, and his fear of death. But their balance is just right, the chemistry between Allen's worry-wart Alvy and Keaton's gangly, loopy Annie is one of the screen's best pairings. It couldn't be more engaging.--Susan Benson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792837207", "6301971922", "6302718910", "6300216365", "B000NNOYH4", "6301972147", "B00000GJ2B", "B0000040EL", "630146494X", "6301964365", "6302610702", "6304508557", "0792837096", "0783217528", "6301734734", "1558807780", "6301404440", "6304196806", "6300271870", "6302278929", "6304112254", "0790741067", "630339406X", "0800113055", "0800135954", "6300181367", "6300181340", "6304429274", "0783221347", "B00007E2F6", "6301797957", "6300182320", "6302305950"], "bought_together": ["6301971922"], "also_viewed": ["6301971922", "0792846052", "6303506291"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 222206}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.77, "brand": "", "asin": "6301963911", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5178RVKAYEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Annie Hall [VHS]"}

{"description": "A classic of the late 1950s, this film looks at the string-pulling behind-the-scenes action between desperate press agent Sidney Falco (Tony Curtis) and the ultimate power broker in that long-ago show-biz Manhattan: gossip columnist J.J. Hunsecker (Burt Lancaster). Written by Ernest Lehman and Clifford Odets (who based the Hunsecker character on the similarly brutal and power-mad Walter Winchell), the film follows Falco's attempts to promote a client through Hunsecker's column--until he is forced to make a deal with the devil and help Hunsecker ruin a jazz musician who has the nerve to date Hunsecker's sister. Director Alexander MacKendrick and cinematographer James Wong Howe, shooting on location mostly at night, capture this New York demimonde in silky black and white, in which neon and shadows share a scarily symbiotic relationship--a near-match for the poisonous give-and-take between the edgy Curtis and the dismissive Lancaster.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301973232", "6301025083", "6304212151", "6301966430", "6300181367", "0790741067", "6301966015"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 422365}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6301976126", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C0615A0VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sweet Smell of Success [VHS]"}

Roy Scheider plays a Manhattan psychologist, Sam Rice, who is dragged into a murder investigation when one of his patients is killed. The prime suspect is played by Meryl Streep, then at the height of her stardom (the film was released within a week of Streep's triumphantSophie's Choicein 1982). Rice understandably lets his basic instincts take over and falls for this brisk, blond mystery woman, though he can't help wondering whether she will kiss him or kill him.

Irons won an Oscar for his spooky, knowing performance, which hints at depths of degeneracy without ever putting a dent in a veneer of bored elegance.

But most amazing of all is Powell's duet with her dog. This number should be rated along with Fred Astaire's dance on the ceiling in \"Royal Wedding\" and Donald O'Connor's \"Make 'Em Laugh\" as one of the best of all time.

{"description": "Kevin Costner's lousy English accent is a small obstacle in this often exciting version of the Robin Hood fable. That aside, it's refreshing to have a preface to the old story in which we meet the robber hero of Sherwood Forest as a soldier in King Richard's Crusades, coming home to find his people under siege from the cruelties of the Sheriff of Nottingham (Alan Rickman). After Robin and his community of outcasts and fighters take to the trees, director Kevin Reynolds (Fandango,187) is on more familiar narrative ground, and he goes for the gusto with lots of original action (Robin shoots two arrows simultaneously from his bow in two directions). Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, as Marion, makes a convincing damsel in distress, and Morgan Freeman brings dignity to his role as Robin's Moor friend. Alan Rickman, however, gets the most attention for his scene-chewing role as the rotten sheriff, an almost campy performance that is highly entertaining but perhaps a little out of sorts with the rest of the film.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["0788802194", "0783235968", "6303909884", "0792839846"], "also_viewed": ["6302415853", "6303422926", "6302178924"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 303110}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.5, "brand": "", "asin": "6302206294", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q09JK4QNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves [VHS]"}

Channeling her restlessness, she soon makes a positive though highly self-sacrificial decision on her daughter's behalf, and endures the agony of being replaced in her husband's life by an old, blue-blooded flame. King Vidor (The Crowd) directs with a fascinating sense of duality about Stanwyck's character: is her lower-caste vulgarity something to sneer at or something to applaud for the contrast she presents to the mannered upper classes? Stanwyck plays the riddle brilliantly, right down to the final moment of her character's weird self-satisfaction at being ostracized from her daughter's honeyed life.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000F7CMQI", "6303057225", "B00000JKNL", "6302413486", "6303962068", "630197624X", "6300988805", "6303120474", "6302278929", "6302452945", "6302375827", "630233683X", "B000003KE0", "6301670140", "6300987523", "6302041090", "0783215096", "6301965655", "6300183874", "6303011403", "B0002KPHXI", "630278705X", "B003VLF79E", "6301965620", "630276016X", "6302717744", "B0009S4IK6", "630220898X", "6301968905", "0783215517", "630196571X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 378505}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6302452996", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GBA3WJ10L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Stella Dallas [VHS]"}

{"description": "While working as a counselor at a summer camp, college-student Marjorie Morgenstern falls for 32-year-old Noel Airman, a would-be dramatist working at a nearby summer theater. Like Marjorie, he is an upper-middle-class New York Jew (born 'Ehrman'), but has fallen away from his roots, and Marjorie's parents object among other things to his lack of a suitable profession, such as medicine or law. Noel himself warns Marjorie repeatedly that she's much too naive and conventional for him, but they nonetheless fall in love. As they pursue an on-again-off-again relationship, Marjorie completes her studies at Hunter College, and works to establish an acting career, while Noel first leaves the theater for a job with an advertising agency, but later completes a musical he'd started writing before he and Marjorie had first met. Meanwhile, their relationship deepens (though, consistent with '50s Hollywood mores, the more full-fledged sexuality in their relationship is never explicitly communicated). They plan to marry, but after the musical's critical failure on Broadway, Noel runs away. Marjorie finally tracks him down at the summer theater where they first met--and, realizing that this is probably where he belongs, finally gives up on the relationship. Helping her to move on with her life is Wally, once Noel's assistant, now a very successful Broadway playwright, and all along, Marjorie's unrequited lover. The movie ends with a clear implication Wally and Marjorie will finally be a couple.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003NF97IU", "B001IHJ97O", "B000GUJZFA", "B0007PALVQ", "B00008MTW2", "B000OT6V0K", "B0008ENIMK", "6301216113", "6303403379", "B00143XDYW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 364857}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 29.9, "brand": "", "asin": "6302484510", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21KJZTD7RFL.jpg", "title": "Marjorie Morningstar [VHS]"}

{"description": "Roger Moore was introduced as James Bond in this 1973 action movie featuring secret agent 007. More self-consciously suave and formal than predecessor Sean Connery, he immediately reestablished Bond as an uncomplicated and wooden fellow for the feel-good '70s. This film also marks a deviation from the more character-driven stories of the Connery years, a deliberate shift to plastic action (multiple chases, bravura stunts) that made the franchise more of a comic book or machine. If that's not depressing enough, there's even a good British director on board, Guy Hamilton (Force 10 from Navarone). The story finds Bond taking on an international drug dealer (Yaphet Kotto), and while that may be superficially relevant, it isn't exactly the same as fighting supervillains on the order ofGoldfinger.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302510023", "6302510015", "6302510031", "630251004X", "6302510198", "630251018X", "6302380596", "6304047843", "6302380294", "630238060X", "6302380588", "B000006FNX", "6303651488", "B0000068SI", "6305784906", "B00008V2VP", "6304032579", "B00004TYS8", "6303651461", "B00004RWUH", "6302824613", "B00AQSN7HE", "B001PPLIEG", "B00004W9C7", "6301966317", "0783221347", "0783235593", "B00004RG68", "B00005PJ8I", "630596260X", "B000065U6Q"], "bought_together": ["6302510023", "6302510031"], "also_viewed": ["630251018X", "6302510015", "6302510031", "6303651461", "6304047843", "630238060X", "6302380588", "B00004TYS8", "B00004RWUH", "6303651488", "630251004X", "6302510198", "6302510023", "6305784906", "6303215734", "6304032579", "6302380294"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 165502}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.46, "brand": "", "asin": "6302510007", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N5PV6X7FL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bond: Live &amp; Let Die [VHS]"}
{"description": "There isn't much of Edgar Allan Poe left in this stylish but gruesome thriller. Bela Lugosi followedDraculawith a scenery-chewing performance as Dr.&nbsp;Mirakle, a mad scientist and sideshow hypnotist who uses his sideshow, which also features his trained gorilla (a stunt man in a phony, flea-bitten costume), as a cover for his sadistic experiments. His ape kidnaps street women whom Mirakle lashes to a crucifix-like pillory, strips to their underwear, and injects with simian blood. They inevitably die horribly, and he discards the bodies via a trap door over the river. When the ape falls in love with a lovely young Parisian miss (Sidney Fox), Mirakle sends him to abduct her from her attic room (one of the few elements left intact from Poe's story). Director Robert Florey, who inherited the project after losingFrankensteinto James Whale, shows his debt to the German expressionists with a gloomy, shadowy world of foggy alleys, misty riverbanks, and near-perpetual night (beautifully captured by cinematographer Karl Freund, later the director ofThe Mummy). Unfortunately ill-conceived comic relief too often breaks the carefully controlled mood of menace and the unsettling undercurrent of perversity, but Florey's striking images and inventive direction are enough to pull the film through the dead spots.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300183084", "6302526140", "6302526175", "6302526191", "6300181278", "630252542X", "6302843227", "6301005783", "630252587X", "6302843200", "6302526094", "6302843219", "630018529X", "6303506259", "6302841763", "B004X63SCY", "6303506267", "6303129153"], "bought_together": ["6300183084"], "also_viewed": ["6300181286", "6300183092", "6300181278", "6302841879", "630252542X", "6302526175", "6302843219", "6300185281", "6302526191", "B0009X770E"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 392017}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.9, "brand": "", "asin": "6302526086", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TAN2H1Y0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Murders in the Rue Morgue [VHS]"}

{"description": "Like moths to a flame, great actors gravitate to the singular genius of playwright-screenwriter David Mamet, who updated his Pulitzer Prize-winning play for this all-star screen adaptation. The material is not inherently cinematic, so the movie's greatest asset is Mamet's peerless dialogue and the assembly of a once-in-a-lifetime cast led by Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, and Alec Baldwin (the last in a role Mamet created especially for the film). Often regarded as a critique of the Reagan administration's impact on the American economy, the play and film focus on a competitive group of real estate salesmen who've gone from feast to famine in a market gone cold. When an executive \"motivator\" (Alec Baldwin) demands a sales contest among the agents in the cramped office, the stakes are critically high: any agent who fails to meet his quota of sales \"leads\" (i.e., potential buyers) will lose his job. This intense ultimatum is a boon for the office superstar (Pacino), but a once-successful salesman (Lemmon) now finds himself clinging nervously to faded glory. Political and personal rivalries erupt under pressure when the other agents (Alan Arkin, Ed Harris) suspect the office manager (Kevin Spacey) of foul play. This cauldron of anxiety, tension, and sheer desperation provides fertile soil for Mamet's scathingly rich dialogue, which is like rocket fuel for some of the greatest actors of our time. Pacino won an Oscar nomination for his volatile performance, but it's Lemmon who's the standout, doing some of the best work of his distinguished career. Director James Foley shapes Mamet's play into a stylish, intensely focused film that will stand for decades as a testament to its brilliant writer and cast.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303515223", "1558807780"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 369412}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.3, "brand": "", "asin": "6302732875", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51S2V1ZW1GL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Glengarry Glen Ross [VHS]"}

{"description": "EDITOR'S NOTE: According to a Warner Home Video technician involved in  the production ofThe Stanley Kubrick Collection, Kubrick authorized all aspects of theCollection, from the use of Digital Component Video (or \"D-1\") masters originally approved in 1989, to the use of minimalist screen menus, chapter stops, and (in the case of2001: A Space OdysseyandThe Shiningon DVD) supplementary materials. Full-screen presentation ofThe ShiningandFull Metal Jacketwas also approved by Kubrick, who recomposed his original framing,  reportedly believing that those films looked best on video in the full-screen format. (In fact, the original theatrical aspect ratio ofThe Shiningwas 1.66:1, meaning that a relatively small portion of the image is lost.)

{"description": "This 1987 thriller was a predictable hit with the teen audience it worked overtime to attract. Like most of director Joel Schumacher's films, it's conspicuously designed to push the right marketing and demographic buttons, and granted, there's some pretty cool stuff going on here and there. Take Kiefer Sutherland, for instance. InStand by Mehe played a memorable bully, but here he goes one step further as a memorable bullyvampirewho leads a tribe of teenage vampires on their nocturnal spree of bloodsucking havoc. Jason Patric plays the new guy in town, who quickly attracts a lovely girlfriend (Jami Gertz), only to find that she might be recruiting him into the vampire fold. The movie gets sillier as it goes along, and resorts to a routine action-movie showdown, but it's a visual knockout (featuring great cinematography by Michael Chapman) and boasts a cast that's eminently able (pardon the pun) to sink their teeth into the best parts of an uneven screenplay.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["630018403X", "B00000JPH5", "6300263673", "6300218031", "B00004U8PA", "6300183483", "6301963725", "B00000JGEK", "0784011923", "6300183211", "6300248089", "6302482712", "6300214753", "6304214502", "B000005XXG", "6302256615"], "bought_together": ["630018403X"], "also_viewed": ["6303212379", "0792151712", "6303506291", "6300214710", "B000062XM6", "6301928555"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 209903}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6302814782", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5105MSSAX2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lost Boys [VHS]"}

{"description": "G.W. Pabst's 1928 silent masterpiecePandora's Boxstars the luminous and highly photogenic Louise Brooks. She plays the irresistible Lulu, a cabaret star who entices, captures, and eventually destroys all men who cross her path. Her beauty and her fetching charm draw an assortment of repressed and lonely people; Schigolch, a boozy old man who pretends he's her father, Geschwitz, a countess who has also fallen for Lulu, and Schoen, a rich tycoon who carries on an affair with Lulu even though he's to be married. His short solution is to put Lulu in his son Alwa's vaudeville show. As Alwa, too, becomes trapped in Lulu's charms, Schoen's fianc&eacute;e catches Lulu and Schoen in a backstage embrace. Lulu quickly takes her place as Schoen's bride, only to drive Schoen to suicide during their wedding party. Put on trial for murder, Lulu almost gets out of it by simply batting her eyes at the prosecutor. Still, she is found guilty, and Alwa, who has grown increasingly obsessed, causes a distraction to allow Lulu's escape from the courthouse. Alwa, Lulu, and Schoen become desperate fugitives, eventually ending up in London where Lulu finally meets her match: Jack the Ripper.Pandora's Boxoffers pure cinematic delights--Pabst's luscious photography, the tense drama of its story line, and most impressively and importantly, Louise Brooks, who gives a performance that is certainly one of the best in the history of cinema.--Shannon Gee", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B000HT3QBO"]}, "price": 9.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 121908}, "asin": "6302919533", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HN3DQP96L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pandora's Box [VHS]"}

Helpless to avert the horror unfolding before them,  Stewart and Sullavan witness old friends becoming fearful and suspicious. Others  cast their lot with the new order and become cruel, jealous, and vengeful--even  drunk on Nazi power. The small German village seduced by the corrupt Nazi  message is an excellent analogy for what happened in Germany as a whole. At the  time, Americans did not want to get involved in another \"European war,\" but  films likeThe Mortal Stormtried to show Americans that what was  happening overseas could also happen on Maple Street, USA.--Mark Savary", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302717256", "6303333079", "B0087ZG7OI", "B00553K8DQ", "6303560067", "6301968972", "6300208133", "079074886X", "B00005UQ7R", "6301969049", "6304452837", "6304153171", "6303360041", "6302208890", "6301978536", "630344587X"], "bought_together": ["6302717256"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 322764}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 21.92, "brand": "", "asin": "6303120490", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21P89WGMHJL.jpg", "title": "The Mortal Storm [VHS]"}
{"description": "Wolfgang Petersen (In the Line of Fire) made his first English-language film with this 1984 fantasy about a boy (Barret Oliver) visualizing the stories of a book he's reading. The imagined tale involves another boy, a warrior (Noah Hathaway), and his efforts to save the empire of Fantasia from a nemesis called the Nothing. Whether or not the scenario sticks in the memory, what does linger are the unique effects, which are not quite like anything else.

{"description": "This Spanish fluff from 1992 won an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but its significance goes about as far as you can throw a flower petal. The story finds an elderly artist (Fernando Fern&aacute;n G&oacute;mez) giving shelter to a deserter (Jorge Sanz) from the royalist army in provincial Spain, 1931. While on the premises, the young man naturally notes the beauty of all four of his host's daughters. Each takes her turn at seducing him, but this isn't late-night cable TV so much as it is a series of brief character sketches filled out by the way each woman takes charge. It's a clever idea made more clever by the fact that these sundry beauties are acting on the libertine impulses to which their free-thinking father subscribes in principle but has sheepishly abandoned for love. But the film, directed by Fernando Trueba, is rendered so lightly it could almost be mistaken for calendar art.--Tom Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 372125}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 39.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6303283713", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BRPN2X2DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Belle Epoque [VHS]"}

{"description": "Based on an obscure crime novel titledTucker's People, Abraham Polonsky'sForce of Evilhas attained classic status since its release in 1948, when film noir was thriving on the fringes of the Hollywood studio system, where the shadowy attributes of noir were allowed their fullest expression. Which is to say, this gritty drama is drenched in greed, cynicism, and corruption of the soul, as embodied by John Garfield in one of his most memorable roles. He's perfectly cast as Joe Morse, a lawyer whose connection to a ruthless racketeer has nearly destroyed his sense of morality. His participation in a rigged numbers racket could prove disastrous for his high-strung older brother (superbly played by Thomas Gomez), whose small-time policy bank stands to go broke when the rigged numbers pay off--a financial windfall for Joe's powerful boss at everyone else's expense.Joe's corruption is tempered only by remnants of guilt and his redeeming attraction to Edna (Marie Windsor), his brother's secretary, whose common decency gnaws at Joe's rotten conscience. But before Joe can rise from his self-made hell,Force of Eviltakes him to the darkest pit of tragic humanity--a downward spiral perfectly expressed through George Barnes's exquisitely stark cinematography. In style and substance, this is quintessential noir, its plot unfolding with uncompromising toughness and intelligence. More's the pity, then, that director Polonsky was later victimized by the Hollywood blacklist, curtailing a promising career for two decades until Polonsky directed Robert Redford in 1969'sTell Them Willie Boy Is Here. It seems only fitting, then, that Polonsky's remarkable debut is now recognized as one of the finest dramas of its kind.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000PKG7CU", "B0000UX4V2", "0783217390", "0790743531", "0783217528", "0792844564", "6301491920"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 434889}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6303391923", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71FQ9D7V3EL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Force of Evil [VHS]"}

The Rodgers and Hammerstein music, commissioned while Oklahoma was still making musical-theater history, feels tired too, like the result of a hastily written score. The state of Iowa just can't seem to inspire the same quality music as its more memorable, southern cousin. Remember that State Fair gem \"All I Owe Iowa\"? Still, it is R and H, and \"It Might as Well Be Spring\" is here as well as some other decent ditties. There's a country-mouse feeling as the Frake family journeys to the big city for the annual harvest celebration. Young daughter Margy (Jeanne Crain) has her eye on something more exciting than her bore of a fianc, while her brother meets a lovely big-band singer with a secret.

Spencer Tracy plays the American judge selected to head the tribunal that will try the suspected war criminals. As he sets about his task, he must confront the raw emotion felt by the German people, and his own notions of good and evil, right and wrong.

{"description": "The King of Comedy, which flopped at the box office, is actually a gem waiting to be rediscovered. LikeA Face in the Crowd(a not-so-distant cousin to this film),Network, andThe Truman Show, its target is show business--specifically the burning desire to become famous or be near the famous, no matter what. Robert De Niro plays the emotionally unstable, horrendously untalented Rupert Pupkin, a wannabe Vegas-style comedian. His fantasies are egged on by Marsha, a talk-show groupie (brilliantly played by Sandra Bernhard) who hatches a devious, sure-to-backfire plan. Jerry Lewis is terrific in the straight role as the Johnny Carson-like talk-show host Jerry Langford. De Niro's performance as the obsessive Pupkin is among his finest (which is saying a lot) and he never tries to make the character likable in any way. Because there's no hero and no one to root for, and because at times the film insists we get a little too close and personal with Pupkin, some will be put off. Yet it's one of Scorsese's most original and fascinating films, giving viewers much to consider on the subject of celebrity. Its inevitable climax is clever and quietly horrific.--Christopher J.

{"description": "This haunting classic of the silent screen is familiar to every graduate of Film 101. Like Eisenstein'sBattleship Potemkin, Godard'sBreathless, and Welles'sCitizen Kane, Caligari helped define a cinematic school... and forever changed the way the world made movies. It's also great fun, even for modern audiences.The film begins with two men trading horror stories. One promises the other a terrifying true tale--the harrowing story of his fianc&eacute;e's narrow escape from death. Here's the story: an amoral asylum director wants to see if he can order somnambulist patient Cesare to commit murder. To this end, the nefarious doctor masquerades as a traveling showman and picks victims from the gawking carnival crowds. He sends his sleepwalker out to execute bloody deeds by night--crimes of which Cesare is barely aware. Soon, Cesare abducts the narrator's girl and is caught ... which is only the beginning of the surprises.Caligari's world became the textbook example of 1920s German Expressionist cinema--a cockeyed dreamscape, where black-clad actors feverishly chase each other across moody, barely-realistic sets. Think of films such asDark Cityor theNightmare Before ChristmasorSaturday Night Live's \"Sprockets\" sketches.

Anne (Amanda Root) is captivated when she meets the dignified naval officer Capt. Wentworth (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds), but she is advised to discourage his romantic overtures because he has no fortune. They meet again eight years later, but now Capt. Wentworth has become wealthy while Anne's father is in reduced circumstances in the wake of reckless extravagance. A series of circumstances ensue which prevent Anne and Wentworth from expressing their mutual and inevitable love. The film's success depends entirely on the subtle, superb performances of Root and Hinds. The film builds slowly, occasionally leaving you wondering if anything at all is going to happen. When it does, you realize how carefully crafted a film this is, and the final result is grandly rewarding.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303921248", "6304346107", "6300249824", "B004XVMCMQ", "6304087977", "6305892806", "6304057709", "6304383827", "6304595247", "6302719631", "6304178352", "B002DY9KR0"], "bought_together": ["6303921248"], "also_viewed": ["0800141660", "B00AF82WTO", "B00G6HO368", "B000244FFU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 302356}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6303965415", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q908A5Y4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Persuasion [VHS]"}

{"description": "Douglas Fairbanks spared no expense for what may be the most lavish fantasy movie ever made. Inspired by the flying-carpet effects of Fritz Lang's somber but spectacularDer M&uuml;de Tod, Fairbanks (ever the canny businessman) bought the American rights, then hid the film away as he created his own show-stopping adventure, an adaptation ofA Thousand and One Nightsin which the magic-carpet ride was but one of many fantastic marvels. Swaggering through massive marketplace sets and cavernous throne rooms as an incorrigible thief and pickpocket, he scales towering walls (with the help of a magic rope) and leads a merry chase through crowded bazaars in his pursuit of loot--until he falls in love with the beautiful princess and vows to win her heart. This jaunty opening is but mere preamble to the spectacular second act. As three kings scour the globe to retrieve the rarest treasures known to man, the repentant thief embarks on an odyssey through caverns of fire and underwater caves. The marvelous special effects--from the smoke-belching dragon and underwater spider to the flying horse and magic armies arising from the dust--may show their seams but glow with a timeless sense of wonder. William Cameron Menzies's magnificent sets appear to have leapt from the pages of a storybook. As the adventure concludes in a torrent of movie magic that cascades nonstop through the breathless final hour, Fairbanks commands the screen with a hearty laugh and graceful athleticism, the cinema's first action hero triumphant. Kino's restored edition is tinted and features an organ score by Gaylord Carter.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 548495}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "6304083246", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51cz3S-TW4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Thief of Bagdad [VHS]"}

{"description": "The Disney touch is all over this grand, colorful version of the Johann Wyss adventure of a European family set off for the new world of New Guinea. The film opens on a ship jostled and torn by a raging storm while a family struggles to make it through alive. Tossed into a reef near a deserted tropical island, father John Mills takes charge and the family soon turns their island prison into a veritable paradise. Their multilevel tree house, built in record time, is complete with running water and a working pipe organ scavenged from the ship, while their grand yard is abloom in English roses. As a tale of hardship and pioneer pluck, the tale is pure fantasy, but as entertainment it's energetic and appealing. The island is impossibly populated by ostriches, zebras, lions, and elephants, a private zoo that delights the youngest boy and offers plenty of comic relief. The two older brothers discover even wilder life when they rescue the prisoner of oriental pirates (led by hard-bitten Sessue Hayakawa). There's little real danger anywhere in the film--even the climactic battle with the pirates is a cartoonish affair, with coconut bombs and nonlethal booby traps, until the final desperate, deadly moments. Hardly a faithful adaptation of the novel, but a lush, beautifully photographed film and an entertaining adventure safe for all ages. Dorothy McGuire costars as the proper, worry-prone mother.

{"description": "The swashbuckler genre bumped into science fiction in 1954 for one of Hollywood's great entertainments. The Jules Verne story of adventure under the sea was Walt Disney's magnificent debut into live-action films. A professor (Paul Lukas) seeks the truth about a legendary sea monster in the years just after the Civil War. When his ship is sunk, he, his aide (Peter Lorre), and a harpoon master (Kirk Douglas) survive to discover that the monster is actually a metal submarine run by Captain Nemo (James Mason). Along with the rollicking adventure, it's fun to see the future technology that Verne dreamed up in hisnovel, including diving equipment and sea farming. The film's physical prowess is anchored by the Nautilus, an impressive full-scale gothic submarine complete with red carpet and pipe organ. In the era of big sets,20,000&nbsp;Leaguesset a precedent for films shot on the water and deservedly won Oscars for art direction and special effects. Lost in the inventiveness of the film and great set pieces including a giant squid attack are two great performances. Mason is the perfect Nemo, taut and private, clothed in dark fabric that counters the Technicolor dreamboat that is the beaming red-and-white-stripe-shirted Kirk Douglas as the heroic Ned Land.

This 1993 story is hard to swallow, with its message that love can conquer a brand of mental illness that manifests itself in pyromania: Joon has a bad habit of going a bit around the bend and setting fires, but Sam's tender care apparently has the cure for what ails her. Still, if you want proof that Depp has significant chops as a physical comedian, give this film a try: He does note-perfect renditions of slapstick routines made famous by Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton.--Marshall Fine", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 343205}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6304411448", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519Q07CHSSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Benny &amp; Joon [VHS]"}
{"description": "This gentle comedy almost seems like something out of Hollywood's Golden Age, a movie that might have been made by a talented contract director, perhaps featuring Don Ameche and Claudette Colbert. But in fact it stars George Clooney as an investigative columnist for a New York newspaper and Michelle Pfeiffer as an architect. Both single parents, the two meet and bicker and develop a relationship over the course of a day while their young children play together. Michael Hoffman (Restoration) directs with a good sense of what's funny about harried caretakers and kids who do whatever they want to do. The story stretches out of shape a bit when Clooney's character has to rally to prove some point of corruption at City Hall; nobody involved seems quite up to making that subplot believable, but all that really matters about this very nice movie is the winning love story.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302936381", "5559477621"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 322720}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6304432119", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FK8GTHQ4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "One Fine Day [VHS]"}
{"description": "This science fiction blockbuster from 1990 began its production life as a very different movie than the one that was released. An adaptation of the Philip K. Dick short story &quot;We Can Remember It for You Wholesale,&quot;Total Recallwas originally conceived of with Richard Dreyfuss starring as a Walter Mitty-like character who experiences a variety of artificially induced fantasies. The movie we know is a mega-budget action epic set on Mars.  Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a normal working man who discovers that his entire reality has been invented to conceal a plot of planetary domination. Oscar-winning special effects and violent action propel the twisting plot, in which Arnold manipulates his manipulators in a world of dazzling high technology.

When the family  comes home to find the house cleaned out by \"movers\"--who Daniels knows  are protected by the corrupt District Attorney John Slade (Keenan Wynn)--he decides to run against Slade in the next election. Meanwhile, hoodlums  connected to the same crime syndicate get hold of the mystical ring that  turns poor Daniels (via mid-'70s special effects) into Elwood, the dog owned by the local ice-cream vendor (Tim Conway). Lots of chase scenes, a little  roller derby action, and some cherry pie throwing complicate both Daniels's bid  for office and his quest to remain a human being.

{"description": "After the tight plotting and quirky intensity ofFargo, this casually amusing follow-up from the prolifically inventive Coen (Ethan and Joel) brothers seems like a bit of a lark, and the result was a box-office disappointment. The good news is,The Big Lebowskiis every bit a Coen movie, and its lazy plot is part of its laidback charm. After all, how many movies can claim as their hero a pot-bellied, pot-smoking loser named Jeff \"The Dude\" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) who spends most of his time bowling and getting stoned? And where else could you find a hairnetted Latino bowler named Jesus (John Turturro) who sports dazzling purple footgear, or an erotic artist (Julianne Moore) whose creativity consists of covering her naked body in paint, flying through the air in a leather harness, and splatting herself against a giant canvas? Who else but the Coens would think of showing you a camera view from inside the holes of a bowling ball, or an elaborate Busby Berkely-styled musical dream sequence involving a Viking goddess and giant bowling pins? The plot--which finds Lebowski involved in a kidnapping scheme after he's mistaken for a rich guy with the same name--is almost beside the point. What counts here is a steady cascade of hilarious dialogue, great work from Coen regulars John Goodman and Steve Buscemi, and the kind of cinematic ingenuity that puts the Coens in a class all their own. Be sure to watch with snacks in hand, becauseThe Big Lebowskimight give you a giddy case of the munchies.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783228317", "0792845684", "B000056V73", "B000059HCI", "B0002G2B2W", "6305123616", "0792839846", "6304078145", "6302610702", "6304340648", "6301666569", "6302516986", "0790705141", "6303953425", "6300214753", "6305499365", "B00005ATQA", "630268644X", "6301578805", "6301627768", "6300184064", "0790734079", "6303454089", "6302941318", "6302054982", "1558807381"], "also_viewed": ["B0002G2B2W", "0783228317", "6304297912"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 212775}, "asin": "6304994540", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WB1EBQW6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Big Lebowski [VHS]"}

{"description": "Bull Durhamis about minor league baseball. It's also about romance, sex, poetry, metaphysics, and talent--though not necessarily in that order. Susan Sarandon plays a loopy lady who just loves America's national pastime--and the men who play it. At the opening of every season, she attaches herself to a promising rookie and guides him through the season. Unfortunately, the player she bestows her favors upon does not really deserve it. She knows it, and veteran Kevin Costner knows it. Her choice, a dim bulb played for laughs by Tim Robbins, is the only one who doesn't know it. The film, directed by its writer, Ron Shelton, a former minor league player, is rich in subtle detail. There are Edith Piaf records playing in the background, fast-talking managers, and minor characters as developed as the leads. Sarandon's retro-'50s outfits make you think she's just another bimbo, not an English teacher very much in control of her life. And Costner's clear-eyed, slightly vitriolic performance is devastatingly sexy and keenly witty. The love scenes, though tasteful, are almost as humorous as they are hot. Sarandon's character likes to tie her players up and expand their horizons by reading Walt Whitman to them, \"'cause a guy will listen to anything if he thinks it's foreplay.\" How can you not love a movie with such a wicked sense of humor?--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFYKWU", "B0068FZ0GK", "B000MNOX94", "078324021X", "B0010YSD90", "0800177258", "B000068NNU", "B00005M20J", "B002AT8KD8", "B0060ZJ7BC", "B000FOPPDI", "B009NNM9OA", "B00DW5IKW0", "B00028HBES", "B00009AOAX", "0792844874", "B00AEFXHNI", "0767817729", "B000A0GXRO", "0792843592", "B009POCG2C", "B002NZK5TQ", "B00009AOAW", "B004AOECXI", "B00GMTTD56", "B00E1HIWTO", "B00AEBB9NM", "B003AWRM9M", "B0006GAI5U", "B00F3LSXPA", "B00005N89R", "B000HC2LHG", "0800141822", "0800141741", "B00007BKVC", "B00004W221", "B00005V0XF", "B008H6GHHY", "B00AEFYR3C", "B000MNOX7G", "B0000DIXDR", "B0001US66Y", "B0000633U2", "B0000TANUI", "B007N31YH0", "B0007LLPXI", "B000069I1K", "0783225733", "B00JPV95GK", "B000CCBCAS", "B001YV504U", "B004X2TYG2", "6305262268", "B00004RF84", "B0012YYZDG", "B000P0J0EW", "B0007IO6NM", "6305128952", "B0013XZ760", "B002VWNID6", "B003S1UNZU", "B002U4UYYQ", "B00IB3SDRK", "B00005JNP4", "B00004XPPB", "B00004RE27", "B002GHHHHO", "B002VWNICC", "B000CNFC76", "B001LGXIA6", "B00AATUZLU", "B000056VP4", "B001ILFUBE", "B00AEFYVUQ", "B00005B6JZ", "6305212112", "B00B83ROIE", "B0045HCJJ4", "B002GHHHP6", "B0000AOV4I", "B00AMSQBP8", "B0024EWP6W", "B000XJD33O", "B0004Z33G4", "B00AEFYJI0", "B00GHJ1YUI", "B00026ZG10", "B0006J28NC", "B00079Z9VO", "B004SIP9U6", "B0006Q941Y", "B00AEBB9UK", "B0002WZTOI", "0792838408", "B00005O06I", "B000EXZFCQ", "B00007LP8J", "B00066FBQG", "B000F6ZIII"], "bought_together": ["B0068FZ0GK", "B000MNOX94"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0068FZ0GK", "078324021X", "B0060ZJ7BC", "B000068NNU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 312090}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.97, "brand": "", "asin": "6305090645", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71455K7BRSL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Bull Durham"}
{"description": "Audrey Hepburn is the delightful young Sabrina, the daughter of a chauffeur who is hopelessly in love with David Larrabee (William Holden), the playboy younger son in the rich Long Island household her father works for. In order to help her forget her woes, Sabrina is shipped off to cooking school in Paris. While there, she befriends a baron who provides a bit of culture--and the encouragement to snip off her childlike ponytail. Upon her return to New York, Sabrina is transformed into a sophisticated woman, and David is entranced by her. However, his older brother Linus (Humphrey Bogart) has arranged David's marriage to Elizabeth Tyson in order to seal a business merger and thus must steer David away from Sabrina. To do this, Linus takes on the task of wooing her for himself. Full of great dialogue (\"A woman happy in love, she burns the souffl&eacute;; a woman unhappy in love, she forgets to turn on the oven\") and wonderful performances, this film is a romantic masterpiece.

{"description": "With its title inspired by the notorious Black Dahlia murder case,The Blue Gardeniathrows a twist into the story by making the mystery woman not the victim but the suspect in a lurid murder case. Anne Baxter, playing a virginal blonde with almost breathless innocence, impulsively accepts a blind date after receiving a \"Dear Jane\" letter from her boyfriend in Korea. Raymond Burr oozes slime as the lothario who plots his seduction with cynical calculation (\"For drinks, Polynesian Pearl Divers, and don't spare the rum!\") and the naive Baxter is easy prey, until she fights back against his advances with a fireplace poker and stumbles home. Waking up the  next morning with the past evening a veritable blank, she discovers herself the prime suspect in a murder case trumpeted into a sensationalistic headline story by calculating columnist Richard Conte. Fritz Lang transforms the rather conventional low-budget thriller into a paranoid nightmare, his cheap sets and flat backdrops creating a tawdry world peopled by cynics and opportunists preying on the guileless, and Baxter makes every guilt-ridden moment palpable. Like in many film noir thrillers, the pat conclusion seems wholly arbitrary, the product of the Hollywood  happy-ending machine. However, Lang's film isn't about the mystery, but the experience of an innocent whose single, desperate transgression turns her world upside down.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301640667", "6301491920"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 458369}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 39.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6305226199", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/210M64YPQ9L.jpg", "title": "The Blue Gardenia [VHS]"}

{"description": "Reportedly the last feature to be personally shepherded by Walt Disney himself,The Happiest Millionaireis a stubbornly old-fashioned musical intended to build on the success ofMary Poppins, relying on songs and score from Richard&nbsp;M. and Robert&nbsp;B. Sherman, the studio's resident songwriting team responsible for the hits ofPoppins. Despite that pedigree, and a cast headlined by Fred MacMurray, Greer Garson, Tommy Steele, Geraldine Page, and, in their screen debuts, Lesley Anne Warren and John Davidson, the would-be successor wound up a white elephant.Released in 1967, a watershed year for youth culture and social upheaval,The Happiest Millionaireromanticizes Philadelphia's upper crust circa 1916. Its title character, Anthony&nbsp;J. Drexel Biddle (MacMurray), is a militant industrialist urging America's mobilization against Germany, and noteworthy for an eccentric lifestyle that includes his own bible study classes, martial arts training, and (in a lone nod toward any remotely modern social values) a readiness to empower his lovely, headstrong daughter, Cordelia (Warren).Under Norman Tokar's busy but routine direction, the project does muster moments of charm, and packs its story line with enough twists to partly explain its excessive 144-minute length. But the unintended irony of paeans to capitalism and conservative politics in an era ofSgt.&nbsp;Pepperisn't masked by the Shermans' music, which is eminently forgettable, despite the game mugging of Tommy Steele as an immigrant Irish butler. Equally game is MacMurray, but as a singer, he's no Rex Harrison.--Sam  Sutherland", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B0000DZTM7", "B00006472U", "B0001I55OW", "B00006472N", "0788806661", "B008H6GHJM", "0764005634", "B0000DZ3EG", "6305807655"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 528182}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6305512094", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TKYV2C2ML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Happiest Millionaire (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "This 1975 film sits near the top of any list of the best films of the 1970s, perhaps in the top five and, in some people's minds, at the pinnacle itself. Robert Altman, at his most Altmanesque, spins together plot strands involving two dozen people over the course of one particularly busy weekend in Music City, USA. Though several of the story lines deal with country-western stars--played by Henry Gibson, Ronee Blakley and Karen Black--the plot also deals with the country scene's wannabes, the business people who pull the strings and the operative for a mysterious presidential candidate who is trying to get the de facto endorsement of some of the country stars by having them appear at a rally for him. (The unknown but rocketing presidential aspirant was eerily echoed the next year, when Jimmy Carter came out of nowhere to win the presidency.) Blakley is heartbreakingly fragile as a Loretta Lynn-like singer on the verge of total mental meltdown, while Lily Tomlin is outstanding as a housewife-gospel singer who has a dalliance with a randy folk-rock cad, perfectly played by Keith Carradine (who won an Oscar for his song \"I'm Easy\"). The cast also includes Jeff Goldblum, Scott Glenn, Keenan Wynn, Shelley Duvall, Geraldine Chaplin (hilarious as a fatuous British TV journalist), Barbara Harris, Michael Murphy, and Ned Beatty, with cameos by Elliott Gould and Julie Christie as themselves. Next toMean Streets, perhaps the most influential film of the decade.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000063K2Q", "B00004SZVS", "B001CW7ZT4", "0780618564", "0767827902", "B000069HZU", "B00002VWE0", "B003XTOBU0", "B000MTFFPO", "B008NNY8TK", "B00BMJ7ZKG", "B00AEFXG2U", "B006TTC5A4", "B0001GH5TW", "B00AEFXN9G", "B00007CVS8", "0792833287", "B000CNESU8", "6305999872", "6304907729", "B003O7I6SE", "B00005BHW6", "B00AEBB89C", "B000286RP2", "B0002XNSZE", "B004P9UWM8", "B0050FXDDQ", "B00005U2KC", "B0045HCJ94", "0792846109", "B0087ZG7OI", "B0010YVCI4", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B00AATV07S", "B005HK13S6", "B001EKP5D2", "B0087ZG7R0", "B0006Q9482", "B0002DCHQA", "B000CNESTE", "0784011710", "B005KQVE1S", "B00000K3CS", "B005152C9G", "0767830555", "B0009GX1CE", "B00005NC66", "B000059TFT", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B001BEK8E2", "B00079Z9VO", "B003VA3JTA", "B00006RCO1", "B0045HCJTO", "B000BITV92", "B00006RCNV", "B00003CXBU", "B000063JDE", "B000022TSY", "B0024EWP6W", "B00BTYU3SK", "B0006GANN2", "B00005JKGX", "B000286RO8", "B00005EBSF", "B00AEFYVUQ", "B003M8NGFI", "B000IHYXH6", "B009NYF2GQ", "B0006GAOJA", "B00AEBB95K", "B000286RNE", "0792843568", "B0009NSCQM", "B00005JKNF", "B0001WTUE4", "B00097DY2A", "B00005AUKE", "B00005V9HI", "0783225903", "B000XJD34I", "B007Y1NR1W", "B00005AUKD", "B00004REAG", "B000UJ48SQ", "B00004RE27", "B005152C7S", "B00005AUK9", "6305132917", "B00K6D1QV8", "B00003CWTI", "B00393SG0G", "0792841409", "B000CEXEWA", "B001EOQCMG", "B00005JM80", "B00782O7LG", "B000PAAJZ6", "B00005QAPH", "B008XAT0TQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00F98FOI6", "B009M7R2LM", "B000063K2Q", "B00004SZVS"]}, "price": 29.48, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 283052}, "asin": "6305918708", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5159RYKKDCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Nashville"}

{"description": "\"Sex, guts, blood, and all men are muthers!\" The all-girl motorcycle club the Man-Eaters is a swaggering, brutal bunch who like to be in the driver's seat. They race for first pick among the \"stud line\" that await them at their favorite watering hole, pound a rival hot-rod gang into the ground in a turf war (and then strip them for good measure), and drag a boy-toy behind their chopper until he's a raw, bleeding pile of hamburger. Why? Because one of their number likes him just a little too much. This wicked, weird, trashy piece of bargain-basement exploitation from gore king Herschell Gordon Lewis (Two Thousand Maniacs) leaves the details of the Man-Eaters' voracious sexual appetites offscreen but puts their bloody and bluntly violent reign of terror front and center, right down to a wild decapitation. After 10 years of filmmaking you'd think he'd develop a little style, but this is as poorly acted, clumsily edited, and utterly primitive as his earlier blood feasts. There's a cool twangy guitar score and a theme song (\"Get Off the Road\") that has since become a riot grrrl standard. With a little more polish it might pass as surreal, but this simultaneously campy and nihilistic slice of biker rebel hedonism is undeniably bizarre.The DVD also features commentary by Lewis, a funky short subject calledBiker Beach Partyfrom the swinging '60s, a gallery of exploitation art, and the original trailer.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00310PSUI", "B00008973F", "B000022TSY", "B0074V61OM", "B000059H8L", "B005OK0YR0", "B000056NW6", "B00004KDES", "630587073X", "B001CDFY50", "6305944261", "0767818172", "B009R68HIA", "B00DI67NYO", "B0000E69GN", "B000BC8T2S", "B00ESZZOLI", "B00004W1A4", "B000AYEI8Q", "B0000YEDTA", "B0036K9CPA", "B00ECXJBX8", "B007XJ5DQ2", "B0002IQB8U", "B000KGGZW6", "B0002UB2XC", "B00004KDER", "B004SKJYJG", "B00004W190", "B000787YRC", "B005DKS1TO", "B0001Z3IK8", "B00B2MLM34", "B00004KDET", "B0000687DF", "B00008H2GX", "B00CP6YNNM", "B00004W19M", "B00006IUIO", "B0000633TB", "6305789649", "B008XOXUV6", "B0001I2C0W", "B000SSONQ6", "B0063E00NO", "B00029RSUO", "B000I2J6V4", "B00008975K", "B000AYELMY", "6305836965", "B001URA5ZM", "B000V1Y46E", "B001J65RCU", "B000FUF70I", "B0000639GF", "B006J6CDQI", "B00009AV90", "B008I5OIR0", "B000069HYY"], "bought_together": ["B00310PSUI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00310PSUI", "B00008973F", "B001CDFY50", "B0036K9CPA"]}, "price": 9.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 157361}, "asin": "6305944334", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MSFCJRG5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "She Devils On Wheels (Special Edition)"}

{"description": "When Steven Spielberg was an adolescent, his first home movie was a backyard war film. When he toured Europe withDuelin his 20s, he saw old men crumble in front of headstones at Omaha Beach. That image became the opening scene ofSaving Private Ryan, his film of a mission following the D-day invasion that many have called the most realistic--and maybe the best--war film ever. With 1998 production standards, Spielberg has been able to create a stunning, unparalleled view of war as hell. We are at Omaha Beach as troops are slaughtered by Germans yet overcome the almost insurmountable odds.A stalwart Tom Hanks plays Captain Miller, a soldier's soldier, who takes a small band of troops behind enemy lines to retrieve a private whose three brothers have recently been killed in action. It's a public relations move for the Army, but it has historical precedent dating back to the Civil War. Some critics of the film have labeled the central characters stereotypes. If that is so, this movie gives stereotypes a good name: Tom Sizemore as the deft sergeant, Edward Burns as the hotheaded Private Reiben, Barry Pepper as the religious sniper, Adam Goldberg as the lone Jew, Vin Diesel as the oversize Private Caparzo, Giovanni Ribisi as the soulful medic, and Jeremy Davies, who as a meek corporal gives the film its most memorable performance.The movie is as heavy and realistic as Spielberg's Oscar-winningSchindler's List, but it's more kinetic. Spielberg and his ace technicians (the film won five Oscars: editing (Michael Kahn), cinematography (Janusz Kaminski), sound, sound effects, and directing) deliver battle sequences that wash over the eyes and hit the gut. The violence is extreme but never gratuitous.

In the center are the splendid houses of the nouveaux-riches rubber barons.

In order to circumbent this barrier, he literally has his huge steamboat lifted over a mountain from one branch of the river to the other.\n\nWith the aid of a tribe of Indians bewitched by records featuring the voice of the greatest singer of all time, Fitzcarraldo fights fever, mosquitos and suffocating heat to achieve the impossible.\n\nWidescreen, Digitally Mastered, Color, Running Time 157 minutes, Rated PG.

{"description": "Syd (Radha Mitchell) is an editor at a painfully pretentious art  magazine; by chance, she becomes acquainted with lesbian photographer Lucy (Ally Sheedy) and her weirdo German girlfriend (Patricia Clarkson, in a strange Dietrich-like role).  Syd becomes captivated with Lucy and her work and, smelling a career move, offers to feature her in the next issue of the magazine.  The two become attracted, but their relationship is fraught with perils--Syd loses her rather square boyfriend, Lucy's girlfriend takes a hike, the avaricious management at the magazine pressures Syd, and, most importantly, the pair begins to travel down the road of heroin addiction.  Besides the lesbian theme,High Artaddresses such subtexts as what an artist will (or won't) be willing to do for recognition, and what price that recognition carries.High Artis a remarkably honest work, painful at times but understated and thoughtful.  It does an excellent job of portraying the heroin-induced torpor of Lucy and her bohemian friends as they lie around and become consumed with the stuff.  It's a cautionary tale, a sincere love story, a reflection on the nature of art, and a \"lesbian film\" for which the lesbianism is integral but not part of an overriding agenda.  Sheedy is excellent, as is Mitchell in a very expressive role.  It's far from being a feel-good movie, butHigh Artundeniably has some power behind it that will stick with you past the closing credits.--Jerry Renshaw", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00AFDN5Y0", "B008XAGN46", "B00006RJ97", "B00002CGGH", "B002SF9YTS", "B000SUKPL6", "B000A4T804", "B0001HAGSI", "B00FKPJ3VM", "B004BJMEO6", "B000F7CEBG", "B00827OWO8", "B0085E44W8", "B000J4QWIG", "B00011Y1QC", "B004AYMY92", "B00004U104", "B0038M61IC", "B00005QW5T", "B00004YKR3", "B005Q4CLKW", "B004EI2NM2", "B000F3UA6Q", "B001YXXRZ2", "B001E2PQGG", "B00BDTSLEO", "B0039S3872", "B003OYPOUA", "B0009Q0EMY", "B004AHAEV4", "B000062Y1E", "B00H3RT7M0", "B00005BKZK", "B00GPPXNIK", "B000OVLC0W", "B004N21KIC", "B00004STHG", "B000063K0D", "B00CBG9SQS", "B00005NRNS", "B003L20ICE", "B00EMAGCHE", "B008R6U69Y", "B00006CXI7", "B00C1LIZEE", "B00005OLBC", "B00003CYJ4", "B003YYVSEG", "B0002XNT12", "B00INUK5WM", "0780625528", "B000OY9V8Y", "6302703816", "B001MVWMIY", "B00125WAWI", "B007W6XXAE", "B0000C504K", "B003PCHSVO", "B000HT3P4M", "B0002KPIQY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AFDN5Y0", "B00827OWO8", "B008XAGN46", "B00006RJ97"]}, "price": 19.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 627413}, "asin": "B00002JWZT", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/7187XWM9M4L._SY300_.gif", "title": "High Art"}

Nerdy, good-natured Paul Tannek (American Pie's Jason Biggs) is a square peg in the round hole that is New York University. His pot-smoking, girl-chasing roommates hate him, and everyone else on campus ignores him. But when he meets fellow student Dora Diamond (Mena Suvari, American Beauty), he discovers a kindred spirit. Dora is pratically broke, has nowhere to live, and her boyfriend, Professor Edward Alcott (Oscar(r) nominee Greg Kinnear), is more interested in manipulating her than loving her. The more people push them around, the closer Paul and Dora get-she helps him dress better and appreciate New York, he lets her stay with him while she finds a job.

{"description": "To callPearl Harbora throwback to old-time war movies is something of an understatement. Director Michael Bay's epic take on the bombing that brought the United States into World War II hijacks every war movie situation and clich&#xE9; (some affectionate, some stale) you've ever seen and gives them a shiny, glossy spin until the whole movie practically gleams. Planes glisten, water sparkles, trees beckon--and Bay's re-creation of the bombing itself, a 30-minute sequence that's tightly choreographed and amazingly photographed, sets the action movie bar up quite a few notches. And in updating the classic war film, Bay and screenwriter Randall Wallace (Braveheart) use that old plot standby, the love triangle--this time, it's between two pilots (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) and a nurse (Kate Beckinsale) who find themselves stationed at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, during what they thought would be a nice, sunny tour of duty. Then, of course, history intervened.For the first 90 minutes of the movie, Affleck and Beckinsale find a nice, appealing chemistry that plays on his strengths as a movie star and hers as a serious actress--he gives her glamour, she gives him smarts. Their truncated romance--the beginning of which is told in flashback so we can get right to the point where he has to leave her to go to England--works, thanks to their charm. They're no Kate and Leo fromTitanic(a strategy the film strives hard toward), but they're pretty darn adorable in their own right. Hartnett, as the not entirely unwelcome third wheel, squints bravely but makes only a slight dent in the film. Everyone else inPearl Harbor--from Cuba Gooding Jr.'s brave navy seaman to Jon Voight's able impersonation of FDR--is pretty much a glorified walk-on, taking a backseat to the pyrotechnics and action sequences that keep the three-hour film in fairly constant motion. But when that action does take hold,Pearl Harboris quite a thrilling ride.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792151712", "B000059HGY", "B00000K3AN", "B00AEBBA36", "0792133153", "079212569X", "6305169187", "6301734734", "0792147618", "0792116887", "6304618344", "079213690X", "6303269834", "6304925131", "6305718792", "6304259131", "B00004WIDB", "6304935811", "6303057225", "6304143184", "6302250269"], "bought_together": ["B00000K3AN", "B00AEBBA36"], "also_viewed": ["B00000G3PA", "0792151712", "6300213668", "B00000JS61", "6303215734", "6303402348", "B00004WIDB", "079213690X", "6305750750", "B004751DFU", "B00005O893", "B00000K3AN", "6301792734", "B00E5I2MCM", "6305169187", "B00007LVCM", "B007SPPANM", "B00L4K3MLE", "B00FLML7HW", "B008QZ5PY2", "B00JBGWP3Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 234413}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.49, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXTF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HC1ZDJN6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "Employing shock techniques and sound design in a relentless sensory assault,Requiem for a Dreamis about nothing less than the systematic destruction of hope. Based on the novel by Hubert Selby Jr., and adapted by Selby and director Darren Aronofsky, this is undoubtedly one of the most effective films ever made about the experience of drug addiction (both euphoric and nightmarish), and few would deny that Aronofsky, in following his breakthrough filmPi, has pushed the medium to a disturbing extreme, thrusting conventional narrative into a panic zone of traumatized psyches and bodies pushed to the furthest boundaries of chemical tolerance. It's too easy to call this a cautionary tale; it's a guided tour through hell, with Aronofsky as our bold and ruthless host.The film focuses on a quartet of doomed souls, but it's Ellen Burstyn--in a raw and bravely triumphant performance--who most desperately embodies the downward spiral of drug abuse. As lonely widow Sara Goldfarb, she invests all of her dreams in an absurd self-help TV game show, jolting her bloodstream with diet pills and coffee while her son Harry (Jared Leto) shoots heroin with his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and slumming girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly). They're careening toward madness at varying speeds, and Aronofsky tracks this gloomy process by endlessly repeating the imagery of their deadly routines. Tormented by her dietary regime, Sara even imagines a carnivorous refrigerator in one of the film's most memorable scenes. And yet... does any of this have a point? Is Aronofsky telling us anything that any sane person doesn't already know?Requiem for a Dreamis a noteworthy film, but watching it twice would qualify as masochistic behavior.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JM23", "6305594333", "B0007CEXYK", "B00005YUPD", "078401213X", "1560252480", "B00H3JHGBC", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005JMJG", "B000I0QL7I", "B0009A40ES", "B00049QQHI", "B00005ATQB", "B000LAZDPG", "B00003CXZ4", "0792838068", "B0000AC8LR", "0783229526", "6305692572", "B0041KKYEM", "B000QGEB1M", "B00008977H", "B001AR60GK", "B000MGB6NM", "B0045HCJ08", "6305313687", "B001TOD92C", "B00009Y3QI", "B000NO39FG", "B000JBXXYK", "B00008975Z", "6305162026", "B00004UEDQ", "B000068MC2", "B00606OZUY", "B00003CWQR", "B000ERVK4Y", "B000A7DVR2", "B000A9QK6E", "B00EUENWIY", "B0016MJ6T2", "B00005JPAR", "B00008MTXI", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEFXESQ", "B000JMK6LW", "B00004Y6Q5", "B000FVQLQQ", "B000BYA5G4", "B00005JKJA", "B00005JKM2", "B0029LHW68", "B000BBOUUE", "B004FQX5B6", "B000PAAJZ6", "B000N3SU92", "B003YKYX9M", "B00AEBB8O2", "B00007AJF8", "B00A2H9QN8", "B0009WFEDC", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00013RC2K", "B000A7Q2DM", "B00003CXWV", "0792845803", "B001URA5Y8", "B00195I3O0", "B00006AFUR", "B000063JDE", "B00BMKGZVA", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00112S8RS", "B00177YA6U", "0767837398", "B000O76ZQC", "B0052ADP6Y", "B000J10F8C", "B000E6ESU8", "B00009OOFH", "B00005JLRE", "B0059GVBHG", "0767824954", "B00005JLWN", "B00E8G5GU6", "B000QXDCLA", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00004ZETA", "B00AEBB9CS", "B000021Y77", "B00011CZRE", "B002VECM4A", "B00003CXKS", "B006KH6CF4", "B000K7VHQE", "6305127654", "B00AFEXRME", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00020HB32"], "bought_together": ["B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JM23"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JMJG", "B000MEYKD2", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JPAR"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 222264}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.36, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXP1", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519CB9K0QML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut"}
{"description": "Screen sensation Nicole Kidman (MOULIN ROUGE, EYES WIDE SHUT) delivers an utterly unforgettable performance in this scary and stylish suspense thriller.

{"description": "Part conspiracy theory and part religious message,Left Behind(based on the first in a series of runaway bestsellers by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins) is a passable, occasionally compelling thriller that turns the rapture and the ascendance of the Antichrist into something resembling a Robert Ludlum espionage potboiler. The beginning, though, is pure Stephen King: as morose pilot Rayford Steele (Brad Johnson) steers his jet plane toward London, comely flight attendant Hattie Daniels (Chelsea Noble) informs him that a number of passengers have disappeared--at 37,000 feet, leaving their neatly pressed clothes behind. And they're not the only ones who've gone missing. The mass disappearances throw the world into chaos, and the sinisterly compelling Nicolae Carpathia (Gordon Currie), head of the U.N., selflessly steps in to help broker peace among the world's nations. But is he as good intentioned as he seems?Turns out the appropriately named Mr. Carpathia is behind a plot to rule the world and control its food supply, and intrepid reporter Buck Williams (Kirk Cameron, better than you'd expect) is onto him--with a little help from some biblical prophecies. Suffering the problem that befalls most first installments in a series of books and movies,Left Behindbusies itself with the task of introducing characters and setting up expository plot lines, and audiences may be frustrated by the lack of action--Rayford's somewhat labored crisis of faith takes up a good chunk of the film. Still, it's an intriguing premise that should satisfy fans of the novel and possibly pick up a few more converts along the way (be warned, though, this is a modestly budgeted film that looks more like a cable TV movie than the latest James Bond extravaganza). And, if like a fair number of the film's characters, you can't figure out that someone named \"Nicolae Carpathia\" is a bad guy, then, well, you need to bone up on your evil villains.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006HMPB", "B000AY6S0C", "8901732319"], "bought_together": ["B00006HMPB", "B000AY6S0C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 375419}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.73, "brand": "Namesake", "asin": "B00004YS7F", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517490R83YL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Left Behind - The Movie [VHS]"}
{"description": "The Organizationwas the second and final  sequel to 1967'sIn the Heat of the Nightand sees Sidney Poitier's homicide detective Virgil Tibbs called in to investigate the murder of a factory manager. In a lengthy, dialogue-free opening (the film's best sequence), it appears that we are witnessing the culprits in action. However, this group turns out to be a gang of idealistic young vigilantes who knew that the factory was a front for an international drugs cartel--the Organization of the title--and have made off with a haul of $5 million worth of heroin secreted there. Suspected of the manager's murder, they meet Tibbs and seek his cooperation. He agrees to help them, pitting himself not only against the Organization but his own police department.Set in San Francisco,The Organizationinvites invidious comparisons withBullitt: its somewhat cheesy contemporary soundtrack, derived from Miles Davis'Bitches Brew, certainly marks it as a piece of its period, as do the occasionally less-than-convincing action sequences, risible acting, and far-fetched plot. Poitier, as ever, lends the film a certain dignity and poise, worthy of better material to work with than this. The film is also notable for providing early showcases for two of Cop TV's most famous captains: Daniel J.

{"description": "With so many romantic comedies revolving around eternally adolescent men with self-centered philosophies and terminal commitment problems, it's kind of nice to see one of them take stock of himself. Tim Daly, a chef with unconventional methods (try his dishwasher fish), embarks on a quest through past loves with sincere questions about why things didn't work out. Boyish Daly is charming as the rogue romantic, and his tour through broken affairs gives some fine actresses comic-showcase scenes--Jamie Gertz, Laura Leighton, Elizabeth Pe&ntilde;a, Mimi Rogers, and Katy Selverstone among them. Olivia d'Abo is his current flame, a would-be psychic restaurateur who sets out after him, and Melora Hardin is an old gal pal who just may be his best chance at a fresh start. This isn't quite theHigh Fidelitything--Daly's quest is a well-meaning attempt at personal growth, not a sour tour of self-justification--but then this is hardly as ambitious or revealing. He doesn't learn anything that a little serious self-examination would reveal just as well, but that's beside the point. It's a warm and winning little comedy about growing up, letting go, and opening up, with deftly played comedy and generous performances.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 205308}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Seven Girlfriends", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009I7NGM", "B00AEBB9UK", "B00005MM6A", "B0000C2IR4", "B002OQZE5E", "B001KZVQKC", "B0000UHCME", "6302958822", "6300128490", "6302236266", "6303926177", "B000B6H1YG", "B000228EHM", "630310665X", "B0009PW3RY", "6305181136"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BZ9957J8L._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "B000055WFX"}

{"description": "Robert Lee King directs this wacky, campy fusion of teenaged surfer flicks and slasher sagas. Impossibly perky Florence (Lauren Ambrose) doesn't quite fit in at her thoroughly square high school in her seaside Southern California town -- that is, until she happens upon a band of ultra-hip surfer dudes. Renaming herself \"Chicklet,\" she tries her gosh-darnedest to be the sole girl riding the waves with the group led by suave Kanaka (Thomas Gibson). While adopting her surfer alter ego, Florence soon discovers that other less pleasant personalities emerge when confronted with the sight of polka dots. One called Anne Bowman is a tough, \"experienced\" older lady, while the other, Tylene, is a stereotypical sassy black woman. Blacking out whenever these other personalities take over, Florence becomes increasingly worried that she is responsible for a series of grizzly murders. Of course, she is far from the only suspicious character in her oceanside community -- there's B-movie star Bettina Barnes (Kimberly Davies), Swedish exchange student Lars (Matt Keeslar), and Florence's own unnervingly-perfect mom (Beth Broderick). This film was adapted from a popular off-Broadway play written by Charles Busch. ~ Jonathan Crow, Rovi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007VF22S", "B00019GHQQ", "B000GG4XYW", "B00009MEB8", "0802137857", "B00JVLGL7U", "B00K1L4NBU", "B000VFIDPI", "B00I4CWIVU", "B00004X0Q7", "B00KCTG4PO", "B00DJYKEQ4", "B001UV4XGU", "B000QUEQ4K", "B00IA7MFEO", "B00DOZNGTK", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B006M3M5FM", "B002I41KNW", "B0018M6J90", "B00000I6D4", "B00ET2ODTE", "0780629167", "B00FQPLYYK", "0780628306", "B00GB0ORJ8", "B004HHX9OQ", "B0024FAG44", "B0052SO0J2", "B00CBFB8SU", "B007V6ON9A", "B000929UOQ", "B00JM5CAHA", "B0000560PU", "B00004XPPI", "B0001HAGRE", "B00005QW5X", "B00GHP8SH4", "B0000C3I8I", "B001Y7CVXC", "B0013527L6", "B0042L0OFE", "B0000DD75N", "B005S2F8LQ", "B00FPM1BME", "076784257X", "B00GJ7CUFG", "B000F6II1M", "B005XB8T68", "B00FYL08RK", "B00JJRLG7G", "B005KBP07W", "B00HRJVHKE", "B00276L4TG", "B00EL6ACBQ", "B003THSXJ6", "B00199PPP6", "B00005JLD1", "B000BYRCQU", "0767827740", "B0006Z2LJC", "B00344EAMS", "B00009YXHG", "B0000714BP", "B0042FUHUM", "006198583X", "B00007ELF9", "B00HW3L9MG", "B00IXD2N1K", "B00FB349R6", "B00D2UMHIS", "B00GSMZ3I8", "B00ESZZOOK", "B00008UALE", "B008YAPR7E", "B00005LQ0T", "B002AT4JNI", "B00CERJJ68", "B0080BFWE0", "B00IBQ5M1W", "B00I3C1T6G", "6305847045", "B000ICL3L0", "B0053TWVZA", "B002DQSKMY", "B004OBQDCK", "B001D5C1OO", "B00G3MXSW6", "B00EMAGKNU", "B00005COWD", "B000CS45NS", "0062196243", "B003THSXJG", "B00I04SVV8", "B00005NGAF", "B00CBFB8WQ", "B001QYY4JM", "B000TEUSMC"], "bought_together": ["B0007VF22S", "B00019GHQQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007VF22S", "B00019GHQQ", "B001UV4XGU", "B008FYZHPG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 35295}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 16.17, "brand": "Strand Releasing", "asin": "B00005ASPE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HWNABM37L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Psycho Beach Party"}

{"description": "Antoine Fuqua (THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS, BAIT) turns up the intensity level with TRAINING DAY, a charged drama about police corruption in downtown Los Angeles. Ethan Hawke stars as Jake Hoyt, a well-intentioned young officer who thinks he's found his ticket to becoming a detective in the form of undercover officer Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Harris is a notorious figure in the streets and in the office. He also has the authority to make Jake's professional wishes come true, provided Jake is able to prove his worth on Alonzo's team. At first, Alonzo's blunt, carefree demeanor provides a shock to Jake's optimistic system, but as it becomes clear that Alonzo is dangerously out of control, Jake must decide whether or not to risk his future in the name of the law.\n\nWashington's performance as the evil, pragmatic detective is a sight to behold. He delivers his lines with a devilish ferocity that keeps the film bubbling throughout. Hawke slips into the role of the rookie everyman with ease, providing a good contrast to Washington's fiery presence. Former video director Fuqua completes the picture by casting musicians Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and Macy Gray in supporting roles.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792841778", "630268644X", "6303012140", "6300214826"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 428216}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.0, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005JKEC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/415AYTB1GNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Training Day [VHS]"}

{"description": "Not surprisingly, deleted scenes and outtakes are the hands-down  highlights ofGoldmember's abundant Infinifilm features. Mike Myers's  throwaway gags are funnier than Pauly Shore's entire career, revealing how a  relaxed set encourages a flood of inspired improvisation.

The Myers/Jay  Roach commentary track is worth a listening for Myers's casual jocularity (and  his decent willingness to give credit to others), but their Hollywood  compliments, while obviously sincere, eventually grow tiresome. More enjoyable  are the pop-up subtitles in the DVD's \"Fact Track\" feature, adding lighthearted  factoids to enhance an already very funny movie.

{"description": "The plethora of extras on this two-disc set are worth your time. There are several well-produced segments on the physical aspects of the film highlighted by a tour of the vast Cinecitt&#xE0; Studio sets with director Martin Scorsese and production designer Dante Ferretti (with a 360-degree-view feature to boot). Historian Luc Sante introduces you to the Five Corners area in New York circa the mid-19th century, and there's a vintage vocabulary guide (from the 1859 edition ofThe Rogue's Lexicon). Even though it was made as a \"puff piece\" for the movie, the Discovery Channel show \"Uncovering the Real Gangs of New York\" is an informative half-hour on the film's historical background. There's another espresso double-shot from a Scorsese commentary track. Not recorded traditionally as he watches the movie, the track pieces together thoughts from the director including some recorded in an NPR interview. This allows Scorsese to be even more focused, dealing with the history of the time and his own 30-year struggle to make the film. One serious demerit for stretching the feature film over both discs, which most likely had to be done with having both Dolby 5.1 and DTS tracks along with the commentary on the long film.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000M341QE", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00080ZG10", "B00AEBB8NI", "B006OFN0SE", "B00005JLSB", "B000C20VPA", "B000MZHW40", "B001N44BVQ", "B002ZG980U", "B000P0J09M", "B00049QQHI", "B004SIP8ZM", "0767830555", "6305313687", "B0006GAOJA", "B00008975Z", "B0016Q2D66", "B0000DI87S", "B00008DP4C", "B00011CZRE", "B000P0J0EW", "B00004XPPB", "B008R65XYC", "B005LAIIJY", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000C20VRS", "B004SIP95G", "B000286RP2", "B002CPMB9O", "B002T9H2LA", "0307388980", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000A7DVR2", "B00AEFXKUI", "B008MILL8W", "B00AEBB9F0", "B001EZE5DI", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004FQX5B6", "B002QEHPQU", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00H9KKGTO", "B004SIP6GI", "B002VWNIEA", "B0001FGBUW", "B000A2UBN4", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00003CWM3", "B008D1Q1VA", "B00005V9HH", "B003ASLJQI", "B003ASLJQS", "B007SPPANM", "B000093FLA", "B00003CXZ4", "B00004XPPG", "B00001ZWUS", "B000H5TH20", "B000FKO5QK", "B002ZG99N6", "6304711905", "B0018CMJSU", "0767817710", "B009AMANBA", "079284646X", "B000FS9FCG", "B000065U1N", "B00AEBB89W", "B000P0J0AG", "B004SIP6QI", "B001QTXM5Y", "B004499LWG", "0783227906", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000J4P9P8", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00AEBB95K", "B000NOKFHQ", "B002VWNICC", "B00009W5CA", "B004U7MR14", "B004AOECXI", "B00003CXRM", "0783231202", "B000069HZP", "0783229526", "B001JIE7JC", "B00005221M", "B000N6TX1I", "B00005JMJG", "B000N3SRO0", "B00003CXWV", "B00005JMYI", "B003HKN52U", "0790732238", "B00004U103", "B003UESJHO", "B000P0J09C"], "bought_together": ["B000M341QE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002ZG980U", "B000P0J09M", "B0013FXWU6", "B00H9KKGTO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 46244}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.89, "brand": "Miramax", "asin": "B00005JKN9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516W0haa4aL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gangs of New York (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}

{"description": "\"One man can make a difference,\" intones a dying millionaire--well, one  man and a superduper car, backed with millions of dollars! Welcome to the  deliciously ridiculous world ofKnight Rider, the early '80s TV  series that launched the career of David Hasselhoff and his magnificent  coif (both later seen in the insanely popularBaywatch). After  being shot in the face, detective Michael Long is revived as Michael  Knight (Hasselhoff) and partnered with an indestructible talking car  called K.I.T.T. (voiced by William Daniels). The duo travel around the  country solving crimes--basically, it'sThe Lone Rangerwith  the car as Silver and Tonto combined. Supported by finicky British  executive Devon Myles (Edward Mulhare) and sexy engineer Bonnie Barstow  (Patricia McPherson), Knight and K.I.T.T. take on everything from  motorcycle gangs to corporate crooks to K.I.T.T.'s own evil twin, K.A.R.R.Like any good cheese,Knight Riderhas only grown more pungent with  age. Decked out in alarming '80s fashions (check out that blue Members  Only jacket in the pilot), earnestly spouting some of the worst dialogue  in the history of television, the absurdly handsome Hasselhoff radiates  the unique charisma that's made him a Teutonic cult figure. In addition to  the 21 episodes of the first season,Knight Rider: Season  Oneincludes a 1991 TV movie,Knight Rider 2000, that tried to  launch a revamped series set in the near future (lacking the cheerful  touch of creator Glen Larson, the attempt sank into oblivion) and brief  interview footage (including Hasselhoff describing when he read the  original script: \"It was glowing in my hands. This was gold.\") It's  unlikely this boxed set will appeal to anyone who didn't become a fan of the  show at an impressionable age, but for those fans,Knight Rider: Season  Oneis gold.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00HUPC5QU", "B000BUE5D2", "B000E5KQM8", "B001J0FVYK", "B0007YMWFK", "B00LT1JHLW", "B0007LXP7W", "B005LFQRTC", "B000BUE5CI", "B0072BNKIO", "B007KW5M6I", "B000GW8U9U", "B000E5KQLY", "B0006IUDXA", "B000IONJI8", "B003CNQPNS", "B00BF65DE6", "B0012IXBNC", "B000FDDYPA", "B001D2WU8Y", "B003W5C0TY", "B00HZMZ286", "B008D1IGJK", "B00005JMHI", "B000PFUANC", "B00CQAVIZS", "B00FWMVVJ0", "B00555ZTQK", "B00DYQ1GBE", "B004M9ZI0C", "B000N4RAQA", "B001BN4WK4", "B001KVVPBQ", "B000O77SNG", "B00AA8Q0JM", "B0014VPFM2", "B008OR5X6M", "B007HR5VH6", "B004XM38CS", "B0009S4IM4", "B0009UC80G", "B00005JLEY", "B004I1K2FK", "B001MVWLYY", "B005EVY8NA", "B0062MHY18", "B00008WJEZ", "B0049GYXCW", "B00GX7D5JW", "B0030Y12B4", "B00005JO3P", "B0007XG26G", "B003XMKU3Y", "B001GMH8WY", "B001G0MFQ0", "B0008KLVB4", "B0007Y08SS", "B006P2TA44", "B000BB1MJ6", "B004UV3KS4", "B000CNESLW", "B000JLTRMC", "B0055SNHQG", "B000CELOV8", "B003BGZ61S", "B000GDH8J2", "B00IZZDWKM", "B003VRJ89S", "B000EMG90O", "B004MTTZIS", "B004HI79LO", "B00857GFJU", "B000FDFSH2", "B003K2G0TA", "B0006Z2KZ2", "B000BKVKSA", "B0006BAWR4", "B00DP36BOI", "B001E6JC1M", "B003XMKU0M", "B008H6GHII", "B000BR9SA0", "B000Z6GT4K", "B0009JE6FM", "B000MLWQ6I", "B000ERVJKY", "B00JL6L4WC", "B00096S45S", "B00JDCP0QA", "B00A33J8UW", "B000GW8UAE", "B000E8JO2S", "B00I099JZK", "B000GTLB4Y", "B0001ZMWYG", "B000OVLMKC", "B001675ZJW", "B0030Y12AK", "B007R915PG"], "bought_together": ["B00HUPC5QU", "B000BUE5D2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00FWMVVJ0", "B00HUPC5QU", "B000E5KQM8", "B000BUE5D2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 85520}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 18.34, "brand": "HASSELHOFF,DAVID", "asin": "B00005JLG4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SBN140WCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Knight Rider - Season One"}

{"description": "With its disturbing images and a few good shocks,The Ringis the kind of frightfest you'll watch to set a chilling mood or spook your susceptible friends, but when you try to sort it out, this well-mounted American remake (of the 1998 Japanese hitRingu, based on Koji Suzuki's popular novel) becomes a batch of incoherent parts. The negligible plot follows a Seattle reporter (Naomi Watts) as she investigates the death of her niece, the victim of a mysterious videotape that, according to urban legend, causes the viewer's death seven days later. (Fear Dot Comborrowed the same idea while avoiding this film's lofty pretensions.) The countdown structure follows the reporter, her son, and her estranged boyfriend into deepening layers of terror--all quite effective until the movie attempts to explain itself. At that you're better off shutting down your brain and letting the creepy visuals take over.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009X763M", "B0006SGYL0", "B004SIP92O", "B00001QGUM", "B00151QYOO", "B001P3SA9Y", "B009XTF8KQ", "B004LWZW24", "B00004BZIY", "B0021L8UFI", "B001JNNDJM", "B000V4UFZK", "B000PMLJMQ", "B0021L8UPS", "B000TJ6PBK", "B0019X3YX2", "B00005RHGK", "B00BEIYMAG", "B0026LQM2Q", "B00005JNJR", "B003UGLCIA", "B000IHY9TS", "B002VWNIDG", "B00AIBZLVY", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00006FDCD", "B008JFUNYG", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00B96TGQS", "B00005JL3T", "B000BTJDGC", "B00AJLHUA8", "B000OVLBGM", "B000RIWAVW", "B003VA3JUO", "B00DW5IM14", "B00005JNY3", "B0021L8UXA", "B00008LUNW", "B000F6IOAM", "B001D2WU9I", "B002JT69IW", "B000AA4JL6", "B00174RCHW", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B00386EZUY", "B0000VCZMK", "B00018D42W", "B0000E2R6P", "B0006SSOHC", "B001U0HBQA", "B00004TS0G", "B003L20IEW", "B008F283VS", "B001DJLD1W", "B0053TWVDC", "B00007G1ZB", "B0015ET3YO", "B00011CZRE", "B004LWZW2O", "B002ZG971U", "B000088NQR", "B002LMSWN2", "B00AEFXSLE", "B0000648X0", "B00005JOWW", "B00005JNNT", "B0031U8OEK", "B006CXIKYC", "B001MVYUR0", "B004SIP9P6", "B003UN0752", "B001NPD9LS", "B008WAM2E2", "B001B1UO6W", "B000GBEWRU", "B00AZTUUQK", "B0002DB54A", "B004SIP9O2", "0780631684", "B003LR5BD0", "B000GCFO0I", "B000VKL6Z2", "B005CFBYW6", "B008G33PIM", "B000GSYRY6", "B0010X73ZG", "B000AM4P9K", "B000A5045Q", "B000056T5E", "B005TK23PQ", "B004BLJQOK", "0783116926", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00BEIYG98", "B005LAIGOQ", "B0097C046W", "B0013FDM7E", "B00BEIYGT8", "B0001FR3IQ"], "bought_together": ["B0009X763M", "B0006SGYL0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004LWZW24", "B000V4UFZK", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00005JNY3"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 99771}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.79, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JLTK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MKWPKHSTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Ring (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "From one of the most celebrated filmmakers in the history of animated cinema comes the most acclaimed film of 2002. Hayao Miyazaki's latest triumph, filled with astonishing animation and epic adventure, is a dazzling masterpiece for the ages. It's a \"wonderfully welcoming work of art that's as funny and entertaining as it is brilliant, beautiful, and deep\" (Joe Morgenstern, Wall Street Journal). SPIRITED AWAY is a wondrous fantasy about a young girl, Chihiro, trapped in a strange new world of spirits. When her parents undergo a mysterious transformation, she must call upon the courage she never knew she had to free herself and return her family to the outside world. An unforgettable story brimming with creativity, SPIRITED AWAY will take you on a journey beyond your imagination. \"To enter the world of Hayao Miyazaki is to experience a kind of lighthearted enchantment that is unique to the world of animation\" (Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times).

{"description": "All on a single disc,The League of Extraordinary Gentlemenoffers two commentary tracks, 12 deleted and extended scenes, and a 54-minute documentary. The track by the two producers and three of the actors is informative, but surprisingly interesting is the track by the film's technicians, particularly costume designer Jacqueline West, whose passion for her craft is infectious.  Unfortunately, the film's two biggest selling points--thegraphic novelthat inspired it and the marquee star, Sean Connery--don't get sufficient attention.  The documentary acknowledges the graphic novel but doesn't really discuss it, concentrating on examinations of the costumes and special effects (e.g., Mr. Hyde was done without CGI).  Connery's involvement consists of a few sound bites at the beginning of some of the documentary chapters.  He and producer Don Murphy explain that he turned downThe Lord of the RingsandThe Matrixbecause he didn't understand them, but even though he wasn't sure he understoodLXG, he wasn't going to turn it down.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002KVUKM", "B0009MDPYM", "B001AK3S4Y", "B001F7MSFM", "B00AEFXCLU", "B002GOAH1A", "B0006IIPIK", "B0000959N0", "6304711891", "B0007P0Y7C", "B003HKN52U", "B000FGGE68", "B003M987PQ", "B006VRRGNK", "B004EPZ07K", "1558908846", "B0002J4X1Q", "B001DHXT20", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B007K3JFUQ", "B008JFUS0U", "B002GHHHL0", "B000OVLBF8", "B00AEFYGBA", "B00005JNTU", "B001OQCV6A", "B000069I1I", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000ENC5YW", "B0006L0LOS", "B000VI70QS", "B00IKM5LXG", "B003Y5H5EW", "0800195175", "B0090SI56Y", "B00005JLQN", "B00070FX5U", "B005LAIH54", "B002A5EBMQ", "B000B8GT92", "B000MX7V70", "B0045HCJGC", "B000ASATYY", "B001CDR1FG", "B001GCUO0W", "B004LWZW42", "B001VLFE7G", "B004SEUIWY", "B003Q6D2B4", "B00004Z4WR", "B009MF5BXK", "B00151QYXU", "B00003CXSD", "B002GSXKNI", "B005LAIGW8", "B002ZG99KO", "B000035Z38", "0767834739", "B00005JN0T", "B002ZG999U", "B00E5I2MEK", "B00E5I2M9K", "B0013FDM7E", "B002ZG97CO", "B0002IQMAM", "B00BTYOYG2", "B008JFURII", "B008JFUO72", "B0013J55B6", "B001HQZJMU", "B000EQHXN2", "B000OVLBHG", "B009MO57H6", "B000AP04FG", "B00008K76U", "B000WC39LI", "6304712499", "B005LAIHYU", "B008JFUPPI", "B0016Q2D5M", "B00006JDVV", "B00111YM5G", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B000I0RQVI", "B000CEXGAU", "B000056PMU", "B001QTXM5Y", "B0000VJG72", "B005LAIH2C", "B00I9TDMRM", "B00005JM5E", "B00008EYA5", "B002ZG99G8", "B00007AJE1", "B000H30B2C", "B002NXSRVG", "B00195FUDC", "B001QB9H1U", "B0006GANOQ", "B001DJLD1M"], "bought_together": ["B0002KVUKM", "B0009MDPYM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002KVUKM", "B00005JLXE", "B001F7MSFM", "B002ZG98LO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12054}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.68, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00005JM5B", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KDD84NPVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Like a good dream, Sofia Coppola'sLost in Translationenvelops you with an aura of fantastic light, moody sound, head-turning love, and a feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, even though you've probably never been to this neon-fused version of Tokyo. Certainly Bob Harris has not. The 50-ish actor has signed on for big money shooting whiskey ads instead of doing something good for his career or his long-distance family. Jetlagged, helplessly lost with his Japanese-speaking director, and out of sync with the metropolis, Harris (Bill Murray, never better) befriends the married but lovelorn 25-year-old Charlotte (played with heaps of poise by 18-year-old Scarlett Johansson). Even before her photographer husband all but abandons her, she is adrift like Harris but in a total entrapment of youth. How Charlotte and Bill discover they are soul mates will be cherished for years to come. Written and directed by Coppola (The Virgin Suicides), the film is far more atmospheric than plot-driven: we whiz through Tokyo parties, karaoke bars, and odd nightlife, always ending up in the impossibly posh hotel where the two are staying. The wisps of bittersweet loneliness of Bill and Charlotte are handled smartly and romantically, but unlike modern studio films, this isn't a May-November fling film. Surely and steadily, the film ends on a much-talked-about grace note, which may burn some, yet awards film lovers who \"always had Paris\" with another cinematic destination of the heart.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305428239", "B0007UC8Y4", "B000BX8R10", "B00005JMJG", "B0000640VJ", "B0010X8NF0", "B003UESJLU", "B007L6VR12", "0767821408", "B00007AJF8", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00DW5IKYS", "B001QOGYBI", "B000M06KJ8", "B00005JLRE", "B00000G02H", "B0006TPE4C", "B0007TKOAA", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00DYVUBYM", "B00H9HZITU", "B000Z8GZYW", "B004SEUIXS", "B00AEFXN9G", "B003CRM6PA", "B00008RH3J", "B000EQHXNW", "B0001I1K32", "B0008JIJ2O", "B001DJ7PR8", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0009PVZD2", "B000CS464G", "B00337KM2S", "B003102JDM", "0790734796", "B001P3SA8K", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B0000WN0SC", "B00003CWTI", "B00003CXZ4", "B00008975Z", "B0057ZAA6W", "B000IU37SO", "B00004RJ73", "B00AEFXGIY", "B007P9HW3M", "B005MYEQ4U", "B000K7VHQE", "B00005JNC2", "B00079Z9VO", "B000063JDE", "B0001US61O", "B0000WN15O", "B00G7QPXUI", "B0041KKYEM", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00006LPGP", "B0006H32EI", "B00005JKJA", "B00AEFYCL4", "B000KX0IOK", "B002T9H2LA", "B001TOD92C", "B004XVMCKS", "B00AEBB9CS", "B008220DGE", "0767802519", "B000069HYF", "B007D5E7C2", "B000M7XRAG", "B004U7MR14", "B003O7I6SE", "B000A7DVR2", "B005LAIIJY", "B00A81MV3U", "B000055Y0X", "B00005V9HH", "B000E33VWW", "0783225903", "B00AEFXE9U", "B000N6TX1I", "B00CIOD6HK", "B0021L8UOY", "B004SIP95G", "B000PAAJZ6", "B002ZG980U", "B007UW9WOQ", "B00GKOJ98E", "B0014D5RBE", "B00011CZRE", "B001HN699A", "B000M4RG7E", "B003ELKNH2", "0767802535", "B00121QGPY", "B004FQX5B6", "6305609764", "B0009A40ES"], "bought_together": ["B0007UC8Y4", "6305428239"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00JAQJMJ0", "B007L6VR12", "B001QOGYBI", "B0010X8NF0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2901}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.77, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JMJ4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518vLN4%2B7KL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lost in Translation"}

Nick Vanderpark (Jack Black) and Tim Dingman (Ben Stiller) are best friends and next-door neighbors who work together at a sandpaper factory. Nick and Tim often find themselves wishing for something more from life, and Nick has a habit of dreaming up harebrained get-rich-quick schemes that usually end in disaster. Tim is particularly appalled by Nick's latest idea, \"Vapoorizer,\" a cleaning product which will make pet feces magically disappear, but to their shock, it turns out to be an incredible success, and before long Nick is wealthy beyond his wildest dreams. Tim, however, is still the same guy getting by in suburbia he's always been, and soon Tim finds himself bitterly resentful of his old friend. As Nick gets richer, Tim gets angrier, and he develops a drinking problem. One night, in a bar, Tim meets an eccentric drifter (Christopher Walken) who offers him some not-so-friendly advice on getting even with his old friend. Envy also stars Rachel Weisz and Amy Poehler as Tim and Nick's much-put-upon spouses.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004P7CNZ4", "B0017RFY56", "B000A3XYIM", "B00AEFYSL8", "B000089778", "0783235070", "B00005KA6V", "B000MCH5RM", "B00005JMW7", "B00024JC4E", "B00AEBB9K0", "B00AEFYPXY", "B005LAII2Q", "B0045HCJRG", "B002NO4ISG", "B00AEFXPG2", "B00HOGBXTU", "B000ICM5X0", "0790742071", "B0000WN1OU", "B000085EFK", "B002ZG99H2", "B00003CXS7", "B00005JLSB", "B000HT386M", "B00AEBB9E6", "B00BTYNXJG", "B00024JC30", "0792842162", "B00007JMDW", "B00AEBBA2M", "B00AEFXP8K", "B0006GANPA", "B00003CXE4", "B00013RC7K", "B00016MSV2", "B00005JM4Q", "B000TGJ82G", "B00004RJ73", "B00006G8JD", "B000274T94", "B00121QGV8", "B001AR0CUK", "079073639X", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B003TY2SPO", "B00005JLQN", "B001L9EXTS", "B001L5800A", "B000RW3VCK", "B004LWZW7E", "B002KLAL88", "B00BLN4UHY", "B00003CXPS", "B0000AKCKI", "B00005JKJJ", "B007UW9WMS", "B00441GZ2S", "B004SIP6WW", "B000OYC7BW", "B002BIULL2", "0800141687", "B00AEFYZCU", "B00005JPQE", "B000K7VHOG", "B000035Z38", "B00AEBBA2C", "B000LC3ICE", "B00008G8LM", "B000FO0AA6", "B001DPHDB0", "B000069HYG", "B00AKGG828", "B000G1R39E", "B00005JMUA", "B003B3V0UM", "B00003CXTM", "B0009PVZ9Q", "B00007AJF8", "B00BLN4UPG", "B000EMGJAO", "B0030Y11XS", "B0002VEUV2", "B00005JNBQ", "0767817710", "B00AEFXKZ8", "B004UXUWEC", "B007UW9W8W", "B007FO5PYK", "B00DL46ZN8", "B002T51X4Q", "B00005JMEW", "B000E8N8H0", "B000K7VHTQ", "B0009PVZD2", "B000TJ6PBK", "B0006TPE4C", "B00003CWTI", "B000RETOGU", "B007C8RZR4"], "bought_together": ["B0000YTOKI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AMSNED0", "B000H30B2C", "B000MCH5RM", "B000A3XYIM"]}, "price": 3.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 47859}, "asin": "B00005JM9Z", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AR4B8M2VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Envy (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "With the slimmest extras package for a Pixar film debuting on DVD,Carsstill shines for home viewing. As with earlier digital-to-digital transfers, the film sounds and looks stunning. There is only one behind-the-scenes feature, a 16-minute cursory but entertaining glance at director John Lasseter's influences (his dad was a car-parts manager), including some of the real-life inspiration for the film such as Michael Wallis's influential book on Route 66 (he also voiced the sheriff). There's a new cartoon for the DVD, \"Mater and Ghost Light,\" which is smile-inducing at best. Four deleted scenes (in storybook format with voices) also show a darker tone the movie may have taken at one point. Best is the adorable short \"One Man Band\" that showed theatrically with the film, and the film's credit sequence can be seen full screen without the credits (and find the Easter egg for an extended version).

{"description": "More than a few critics hailedSpider-Man 2as \"the best superhero movie ever,\" and there's no compelling reason to argue--thanks to a bigger budget, better special effects, and a dynamic, character-driven plot, it's a notch aboveSpider-Manin terms of emotional depth and rich comic-book sensibility.Ordinary PeopleOscar-winner Alvin Sargent received screenplay credit, and celebrated author and comic-book expert Michael Chabon worked on the story, but it's director Sam Raimi's affinity for the material that bringsSpidey 2to vivid life. When a fusion experiment goes terribly wrong, a brilliant physicist (Alfred Molina) is turned into Spidey's newest nemesis, the deranged, mechanically tentacled \"Doctor Octopus,\" obsessed with completing his experiment and killing Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) in the process. Even more compelling is Peter Parker's urgent dilemma: continue his burdensome, lonely life of crime-fighting as Spider-Man, or pursue love and happiness with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst)? Molina's outstanding as a tragic villain controlled by his own invention, and the action sequences are nothing less than breathtaking, but the real success ofSpider-Man 2is its sense of priorities. With all of Hollywood's biggest and best toys at his disposal, Raimi and his writers stay true to the Marvel mythology, honoringSpider-Mancreators Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, and setting the bar impressively high for the challenge ofSpider-Man 3.--Jeff ShannonDVD Features:The first commentary track is by director Sam Raimi and a self-deprecating Tobey Maguire speaking in tandem, and producer (and Marvel CEO) Avi Arad and coproducer Grant Curtis speaking in tandem. They discuss a number of topics, including Raimi's memory of his excitement over Richard Donner's Superman and how the character of Black Cat had to be dropped from the film. The second commentary is by six members of the Oscar-nominated effects team, and one of their primary focuses is how Doc Ock's arms were achieved by a combination of puppetry and CGI.The centerpiece of the second disc is a massive two-hour documentary that can be viewed all at once or in 12 separate pieces. It covers the development of the story, the visual effects, costumes, stunts, and sound and music. Three shorter featurettes cover Peter Parker's struggle between his personal and hero lives, Doc Ock, and the women in Spider-Man's life, and what's interesting is how they discuss those topics not just in relation to the movies but to the comic books as well. (For example, Betty Brant and Gwen Stacy had a much greater impact in the comics.) There's a scene in which you can toggle among three different camera angles, and a gallery of 17 paintings Alex Ross created for the opening sequence. The sound and picture are spectacular, though only theSuperbit editionhas DTS.--David HoriuchiMore Spiderman on DVDTheSpidermanToy StoreThe First FilmSpider Manon the small screenThe SoundtrackGame Boy AdvanceThe BookMore Superheroes on DVDBatmanBladeThe HulkJimmy NeutronJustice LeagueKim PossibleRobocopSpider-ManSupermanWonder WomanX-MenAlso see our Action & Adventure StoreStills fromSpider-Man 2(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000UR9T8C", "B00005JKCH", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00005JNTU", "B000VI70QS", "B001CDR1FG", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000AYELVA", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000AYELVU", "B008JFUO72", "B0083SBMBM", "B004LWZW42", "B004EPZ07K", "B00005JNJV", "B0002IQMAM", "B00E5I2MEK", "B000OVLBF8", "B00E5I2M9K", "B000HEVZ9E", "B008QZ5PY2", "B000HCO83Q", "B00JPS7HOA", "B001QB9H1U", "B00IGVJGYQ", "B0000959N0", "B0007P0Y7C", "B002GSXKN8", "B008JFUPFI", "B000J10EQU", "B0007V6ITE", "B0090SI56Y", "B001GZ6QC4", "6307397594", "B008JFUS0U", "B000IJ79VQ", "B000VR0570", "B002ZG99B8", "B00005JKWJ", "B004LWZWGA", "B005G4TJUC", "B002IPFWTE", "B00005JM5E", "B005LAIGW8", "0767817478", "B000H30B2C", "B002A5EBLW", "B0006L0LOS", "B000U7WV1Y", "B0000VCZLG", "B000P0J06K", "B002GSXKNI", "B002HWRYJE", "B0004Z33EQ", "B0009A409S", "B001DJLD2G", "B000I0RQVI", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B0007RT9MG", "B001GKJ2E8", "B0000AXE8I", "B007K3JFUQ", "B00004STUL", "B00BEZTMFY", "B000P0J06U", "B000957O82", "1402778007", "B0039N74CW", "B003UESJF6", "B00F4FFO8E", "B001HN697M", "B001OST0LW", "B0060FXDCG", "B0049IHX2C", "B000P0J0A6", "B000CEVC9M", "B000UVKGPI", "B009JBWOU0", "B00005JM5B", "B00I6JOD2S", "B001EDVNNU", "B000O77SRC", "B0000633UA", "B000P6XQ50", "B000E8M0VA", "B00008G8M4", "B000EGDB10", "B007REV4T8", "B00BPA2PEI", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B005OY6LBE", "0780624890", "B002935GMS", "0767803434", "6305428042", "B000O78KW4", "B009HIKAN8"], "bought_together": ["B000UR9T8C", "B00005JKCH"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004LWZWFQ", "B003YAR97K", "B00005JKCH", "B000UR9T8C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9593}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.0, "brand": "Marvel Kids", "asin": "B00005JMQW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51529JJX43L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Spider-Man 2 (Widescreen Special Edition)"}
{"description": "Literary adaptations just don't get any better than director Joe Wright's 2005 version of Jane Austen'sPride & Prejudice. The key word here isadaptation, because Wright and gifted screenwriter Deborah Moggach have taken liberties with Austen's classic novel that purists may find objectionable, but in this exquisite film their artistic decisions are entirely justified and exceptionally well executed. It's a more rural England that we see here, circa 1790 (as opposed to Austen's early 19th century), in which Elizabeth Bennet (Keira Knightley) is one of several sisters primed for marriage, with an anxious mother (Brenda Blethyn) only too desperate to see her daughters paired off with the finest, richest husbands available. Elizabeth is strong-willed and opinionated, but her head (not to mention her pride and prejudice) lead her heart astray when she meets the wealthy Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen), whose own sense of decency and discretion (not to mentionhispride and prejudice) prevent him from expressing his mutual affection. They're clearly meant for each other, and as Knightley's performance lights up the screen (still young enough to be girlishly impertinent, yet wise beyond her 20 years), Austen's timeless romance yields yet another timeless adaptation, easily on par with the belovedBBC miniseriesthat has been embraced by millions since originally broadcast in 1995. Individual tastes will vary as to which version should be considered \"definitive,\" but with a stellar supporting cast including Judi Dench and Donald Sutherland, this impeccable production achieves its own kind of perfection.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_viewed": ["0800141660", "B00003JRCQ", "B00G6HO368", "B004SIP7AS", "B004P7CNZO", "B0053Q9DHW", "B000244FDW", "B000GRUQKQ", "B000244FFU", "B0018YCF50", "B001L57ZZG", "B004XVMCMQ", "B00AF82WTO", "B008D1RCHC", "B000Z27HLS", "B000BEZQ0Y", "0767851013", "0486284735", "B0002ZH5PQ", "B0012Q3T6I", "6303921248", "B002XTBE6K", "B001PJRAUS", "B00HYMBAQ0", "B0080QOL1A", "B00062IZ0Y", "B001C4AFOY", "B0012XIGVE", "B002KHNFFS", "B000244FF0", "B0012OVCE6", "B00HYMASS6", "B0009UZGAA", "B000784WMW", "0767020308", "B000LPQ6DE", "B001TJYFRU", "B000FTCEYQ", "B000ZS8GW6", "B005GRF2UK", "B004FM2EL2", "B00G7QPXAI", "149440477X", "B009ERK0SW", "B00006ZXSK", "B0000AUHPK", "B004UOHNCA", "0767020294", "B00094AS9U", "B000Z27HMW", "B002DY9KR0", "B000N4SHOE", "B000683VI4", "193799418X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00G6HO368", "0800141660", "B00003JRCQ", "B005S9EK5Y"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JOHI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZGC68T2JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pride &amp; Prejudice"}

{"description": "While much was made of the fact thatMarie Antoinetteelicited boos at Cannes, the many favorable reviews attracted less attention. Inspired by Antonia Fraser's biography, Sofia Coppola fashions a portrait that's just as dreamy asThe Virgin Suicides, her first literary adaptation, and the Oscar-winningLost in Translation. Set to a soundtrack of post-punk (a conceit that adds more interest than resonance), the teenaged Marie (Kirsten Dunst, quite good) may be shallow, but she's rarely unsympathetic. The story begins in the late-18th century as the Austrian Archduchess agrees to marry Louis-Auguste (Jason Schwartzman). After bidding adieu to her mother, Maria Theresa (Marianne Faithfull), she travels to France, where King Louis XV (Rip Torn) sets the rules--and the list is endless (Judy Davis' Comtesse de Noailles is the primary enforcer). As for the Dauphin, he's just a boy, really, with more interest in his key collection than their marriage bed. Should Marie produce an heir, it might be enough to sustain her--since life is nothing but an endless shopping spree--but clouds gather on the horizon as an impoverished populace rises up against their extravagant leaders. Coppola merely suggests what happens next, although history paints a darker picture. Filmed in and around the Chateau of Versailles,Marie Antoinetteis a riot of rustling gowns, sparkling jewels, and Manolo Blahnik-designed shoes. To say that style trumps substance does its maker a disservice, but the look of the thing does leave the deepest impression.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "The Mummy's Hand: In this acclaimed follow-up to the popular original, an expedition of American archaeologists, headed by Steve Banning (Dick Foran) and Baby Jenson (Wallace Ford), travels to Egypt in search of the undiscovered tomb of the Princess Ananka. There they soon discover the clues that lead them to a 3000-year-old mummy, who is guarded by a sinister high priest (Eduardo Ciannelli). Reluctantly funded by a magician (Cecil Kellaway) and his beautiful daughter (Peggy Moran), the expedition has its hands full battling the mummy, who goes on a killing rampage during each full moon, in this frightening chiller masterpiece.The Mummy's Tomb: The ancient Egypt Mummy, Kharis, is transported from his homeland with the high priest Mehemet (Turhan Bey) to wreak vengeance on the family who has defiled the sacred tomb of his beloved Princess Ananka. Compassionately portrayed by Lon Chaney Jr., Kharis travels to the United States, with companion Mehemet, to seek archaeologist Stephen A. Banning (Dick Foran). Systematically, the last surviving members of the original expedition are killed while Mehemet falls in love with Isobel Evans (Elyse Knox), Banning's beautiful fianc&#xE9;e. He futilely tries to use the Mummy to ensnare Isabel to be his high priestess, but is prevented by a fiery mob that destroys him and the mummy in this classic chiller.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005LC4M", "B00005LC4L", "B00005LC4K", "B00005LC4J", "B00005LC4O", "B00000JQB7", "B00005NSXY", "B0000694WM", "B006TTC5J0", "B00001TZ6Q", "B00000F62P", "0783240961", "B000WNHTCC", "0783233582", "078323502X", "B00LMCDHMS", "B0007R4T26", "B0009X770E", "B00LNBQ8UG", "B000035Z3K", "B003M8NGG2", "B001B9ZVVC", "B0009X770O", "0783240953", "B000A1INIA", "B005ETANC2", "B0001CNRLG", "B00LNBQ8SI", "B0016586Q8", "B00000JMOF", "B000EHSVJG", "B00D9EJFV4", "B00000ILEU", "B000FWHW90", "B00DOZNGC2", "B00HFWETZ8", "B00B94VJYW", "B000063UR0", "B00D9EJFZA", "B000FWHW8Q", "B00005R1O7", "B000FOPPEC", "B000UDGOBG", "B00009NHBC", "B00FJYXP36", "B000U1ZV7G", "B00KTZALDC", "B00009NHC0", "B000RXVNDI", "B00DSAUJ32", "B000AQKU72", "B00009PY4D", "B0007R4TR6", "B000068TPF", "B000EHQTZO", "B002945DUW", "B00009PY4A", "B00AEBB8VK", "B00KIZY3XW", "B0002NRRRY", "B000GRUQJW", "B0001CNRNE", "B008XTVWHK", "B00IQAUO2A", "B0000AUHOO", "B00ITZXDDY", "B0007R4SZY", "B008FL8OTK", "B0013XZ6SY", "B00005AUK0", "078324097X", "B0001CNRLQ", "B000UAFDR0", "B002CWKU18", "B002TSAAS8", "B000VX9WB4", "B0000694WH", "B00006G8K0", "B000FVQLKW", "B0081AWUVI", "B00I462XLG", "B001BSBBIA", "B00009PY48", "6305944288", "B00005KHJP", "B000RXVNCY", "B0016LFUVQ", "B00HNTOVX8", "B000P24FAE", "B0034PWPHY", "B00HRUQ7WG", "B00000K3U3", "B00IQAUO6Q", "B002DY9KQG", "B00DOZNGTK", "B00K1L4NBU", "B005FQ2H0A", "B00FQPLZ08", "B00I099JWI", "B00005RF2C"], "bought_together": ["B00005LC4M", "B00005LC4L"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B006TTC5J0", "B00005LC4K", "B00000JQB7", "B00005LC4L"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 81011}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.62, "brand": "FORAN,DICK/CHANEY,", "asin": "B00005LC4N", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517FHZ0TGGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Mummy's Hand/The Mummy's Tomb"}
{"description": "Deservedly hailed as one of the best films of 2001,Witmakes it clear why top-ranking talents seek refuge in the quality programming of HBO. Unhindered by box-office pressures, director Mike Nichols and Emma Thompson turn the most unglamorous topic--the physical and psychological ravages of cancer--into an exquisite contemplation of life, learning, and tenacious, richly expressed humanity. In adapting Margaret Edson's compassionate, Pulitzer Prize-winning play, Nichols and Thompson open up the one-room setting with a superb supporting cast. But their focus remains on the hospital experience of Vivian (Thompson), a fiercely demanding professor of English literature whose academic specialty--the metaphysical poetry of John Donne--is the armor she wears against the cruel indignities of her cancer treatment. While losing all that she held dear, she reassesses her life as an aloof intellectual, andWitilluminates her bracingly eloquent and deeply moving struggle for dignity, meaning, and peace at life's ultimate crossroads.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0571198775", "B00008L3U4", "B00664AM02", "B00067BCBI", "B00000F5MN", "B00BTYJYP8", "0061137596", "B000068MBW", "B00005RDAN", "082633038X", "B005TZFZBU", "B0001CNRAM", "0061230979", "B0007WFUGK", "1573226572", "B00005AQMJ", "B00003CXC9", "0826330371", "B0007LFPJ8", "082221704X", "032308334X", "B00000IQV7", "B00B8X4WBG", "B004YCKKIM", "0553210351", "0971907498", "B00AEBB9FA", "B000TV1ST2", "B00KMULA9I", "1468014315", "B004QL7KKC", "B0001I2BUI", "B004AE3QYE", "B0043X1FL8", "0965464911", "B004OE9P2C", "B001OQCV1K", "0679742441", "B002D755AI", "0345425979", "B00008L3SE", "B00J5LXQKQ", "B000R7HY00", "B00BTYHBX0", "B0073U2EWM", "1451624123", "B0063HO5C8", "0803617844", "B005DXCOY4", "B00K6D1SAC", "B0007QJ1W0", "B000063ING", "B0002J4X20", "B00AEBB8YM", "1605477303", "0135080908", "1451667256", "0767821432", "0763765422", "1449649009", "B001TKNWUU", "B001GF8WPI", "0132706687", "B00GPWEPZ8", "B00006L92W", "B007CK3NYG", "B0006IIPM6", "B00005JKWX", "0375757759", "B0015OKWKI", "B0000714BZ", "B000K7VHQE", "0787976385", "B0011V7PSC", "0763773840", "B00004TJKK", "B0015OKWKS", "B000F1IQNM", "B0013K2ZGI", "0095234772", "B0007P0YKY", "B0000CE684", "0470959584", "B00005YUO1", "0140422099", "B00GUO2SKA", "0801478731", "0767805712", "B000H0MKOC", "B0018YCF50", "0783227906", "0826157912", "0064430189", "B00AEFYSWM", "1594733120", "B00000JMOF", "0060775823", "1558101764", "B00003CX8U", "B00005BCK9"], "bought_together": ["0571198775"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BTYJYP8", "0571198775", "B00008L3U4", "0826330371"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12441}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005MKKV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41MQWHl-FRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wit"}

{"description": "It takes nearly an hour for anything unusual to happen inWith a Friend Like Harry, but that first hour is oddly unsettling. German filmmaker Dominik Moll reveals the trouble with Harry (Sergi L&oacute;pez) with low-key precision, his thriller sensibility channeled from Hitchcock through Claude Chabrol, while emphasizing casual conversation in the style of Eric Rohmer. Harry's found Michel (Laurent Lucas) in a public restroom, identifying himself as an old schoolmate who remembers far too much about Michel, even though Michel has no recollection of Harry at all. But Harry's an ingratiating type, and nice enough on the surface, so Michel invites Harry and his girlfriend, Plum (Sophie Guillemin), to the summer cottage he's renovating with his wife, Claire (Mathilde Seigner), and their three young daughters. The Spanish actor L&oacute;pez (fromAn Affair of Love) modulates his performance so carefully that Harry's psychosis--never explained, but strangely compelling--reverberates well beyond the film's shocking conclusion. It turns out Harry's been a helpful friend after all, but that's cold comfort in a film that warns us against the kindness of strangers.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CXCF", "B004NWPY3E", "B000055YV3", "B00CUKTHES", "B00003CXZ4", "B00006L91I", "B000296E7W", "B00003CXBZ", "B0000C9JFO", "B000K2V7F0", "B000E33W0I", "B0000A1HQP", "B009B8YMB0", "B004YCKKH8", "B00D954ACC", "B001CIOCLC", "B0087IT8FK", "B00005JLRE", "B00006G8G3", "B001FOPOD8", "B0064NTZQ2", "B00006RZ2W", "B00421IR5I", "6304907729", "0792846443", "B000BC8SWO", "B00B9LNQ0U", "B003ZYU3U0", "B0009GX1CE", "B000069HZP", "B004SEUIXS", "B000FGGNA0", "B007TMYL3O", "B000LPS4FC", "B0001EFV9A", "B0009IWFCY", "B0009PW45A", "B008XAT1A4", "B001SJ5X2M", "B00006IUHF", "B0001GH5S8", "B005UNI2XY"], "bought_together": ["B000296E7W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0031RAOVY"]}, "price": 19.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 120900}, "asin": "B00005NTN4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517Wa%2BWP5WL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "With A Friend Like Harry"}

But when misdeeds from Zelig's multiple-personality past start to surface (larceny, bigamy and an unauthorized appendectomy), the human chameleon is on the run again, and Eudora must search the world over to find and save the only man who's every man she's ever wanted!", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFYVUQ", "B00005AUJK", "B00005O06L", "B00005O06M", "0792846125", "B00005O06I", "0792846117", "B00005O06K", "B00005O06J", "0767819764", "B00005AUJO", "0792846087", "B00013D580", "B00005AUJH", "6304907729", "0792846060", "B00008L3SA", "B00020X88E", "B00003CXGS", "0792846095", "B00008978N", "B000AM6P2U", "B00005AUJI", "B00003CY6A", "B00004STRD", "B000IU37SO", "B002LMV7RA", "0393325822", "0156717204", "B00005JL81", "B0013D8LC2", "B0064NTZKI", "B007NYZA0Q", "B000087F6L", "B005MYEQ4U", "B00005AUJM", "B001DJ7PR8", "B00009Q4W7", "0307269647", "B009UTX4M8", "B009UTX53Q", "B006FSRSFQ", "0307389979", "B00G7QPXUI", "B001IHJ988", "B00G7QPYX4", "B00H96KG2U", "B00006RCNV", "B001BEK8E2", "B00079Z9VO", "B00005QAPH", "0393051676", "B001WLMOL4", "B00E5N8SFC", "B004ULEEQG", "B00A01CQIS", "B000055Y0X", "B0002MHE1O", "B000BMY2LU", "0810957426", "B000TXNDV6", "B00005UQ7T", "B0087ZG7R0", "B000244EWY", "B000093NQZ", "B0049985XW", "B001D8W7EK", "B00005AUJE", "B00GJNQ3I0", "B0050FXDDQ", "B000UJ48SQ", "B001G9F9IW", "B000CNE08S"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFYVUQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005O06M", "B00AEFYVUQ", "0792846117", "B00005AUJK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 36675}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.42, "brand": "MGM", "asin": "B00005O06N", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41AFRGT4F7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Zelig"}
{"description": "It took John Barrymore to bring class to the American horror film, at least in the eyes of the industry. Dignified and virtuous as Dr. Henry Jekyll in this 1920 silent, Barrymore transforms into id incarnate as the lascivious Mr. Hyde. With almost no makeup beyond his gnarled, knobby fingers and greasy hair, Barrymore relies almost solely on a bug-eyed grimace, a spidery body language, and pure theatrical flourish. He tends to be hammy as the leering beast of a thug but brings a tortured struggle to the repressed doctor, horrified at the demon he's unleashed, guilty that he enjoys Hyde's unrestrained life of drinking and whoring, and terrified that he can no longer control the transformations. Martha Mansfield costars as his pure and innocent sweetheart, and Nita Naldi (the vamp ofBlood and Sand) has a small but memorable role as the world-weary dance hall darling who first \"wakens\" Jekyll's \"baser nature.\"--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000TEUSI6", "B000VUQ4HW", "B00005RF2C", "B002945DUW", "B00006JMQG", "B00006JMQH", "B00000JMOF", "B00007CVS8", "B001M9ELJY", "B001E18222", "B0000B1A1J", "B00KXQL6CW", "B00FNRA7VW", "B005D0RDKM", "B009KG7F30", "B00FUABJJQ", "B0056ANHCC", "B00GBT61YS", "B0040QYROA", "B00D9BNONW", "B000060MVE", "B000PMFRVU", "B00049QJ9I", "B000MGBLI2", "B00005O5CA", "B0002HOEQM", "B000035Z3K", "B00I116MVQ", "B003N2JL2A", "B0000B1O9L", "B000RXVNDI", "B00006RCNV", "B006TTC5J0", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B000V3IX82", "B0083Q4JXM", "B000EHQTZO", "B009RWRINE", "B0045HCJS0", "B005FQ2H0A", "B00DZP1C9K", "6305869367", "B00005ABVF", "B001G5T6NU", "B0000549B1", "B007N5YJPC", "B0081XAQNE", "B00AEBBA7W", "6305268150", "B00014NF6G", "B00D8HNRBG", "B000CNESNA", "B00AFQSZB0", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B00B94VJYW", "B00HE010LC", "B001KVZ6LQ", "B00BC0WR9O", "B000063UQP", "0780022343", "B00DI68EBK", "B00D9EJFV4", "B0002HOERG", "B004C2523M", "B0000694WH", "B000SAGGL4", "B00006JMQI", "B004OBQDGG", "0689108141", "B004OOL73W", "B0024R1CF4", "0783240961", "B0009XT8ME", "B004H83IFU", "B0009S4IKG", "B000HT3QBO", "B002TCRQNG", "B000063UR0", "1559409002", "B00014NF66", "B00GPWEPZ8", "B00GPPXNEE", "B0000C2ISF", "B000TXP56M", "B00007H5C8", "B000O78KWE", "B00004Z4VE", "B001BSBBIA", "B000QRIKR2", "B00DPUB56U", "B00116VG2S", "B00009PY45", "B0008ENIAC", "B00AEBB89C", "B0007ZEO8C", "B0000648YD", "B00003CXAF", "B0001UZZS6", "0783240953"], "bought_together": ["B000TEUSI6", "B00005RF2C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000VUQ4HW", "B002945DUW", "B000060MVE", "B00005YJMX"]}, "price": 13.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 77168}, "asin": "B00005O5CF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZK72JXD1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dr. Jekyll &amp; Mr. Hyde"}
{"description": "French humor, which isn't exactly subtle, is delivered via an especially broad premise inThe Closet. A nebbish (Daniel Auteuil) who works at a condom manufacturer learns he's about to be fired; with the help of his neighbor, he pretends to be gay so his boss can't fire him without seeming prejudiced. Then a bigoted coworker (Gerard Depardieu) tries to worm his way into the nebbish's good graces becausehe'safraid of being fired. In the wrong hands,The Closetcould be ham-fisted slapstick. What makes this movie truly delightful is the superb understatement with which every gag is handled; even the sight of Auteuil wearing a giant condom tip on his head has an impeccable deadpan grace. All the performances are excellent; Depardieu's smarm is particularly delicious. Each scene takes a new twist of social discomfort and befuddlement in this winning comedy.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000SSQ7JC", "B0000A1HQP", "B001THZAAI", "B000UAE7MM", "B002AG2NTI", "B001CIOCLC", "B0000C9JFO", "B0069UV0AY", "B0019UGYAU", "B0002TSZMO", "B005V4X8PO", "B009CSVQ8Q", "B000811672", "B00421IR5I", "B000YAA68W", "B0000C23CW", "B0087IT8FK", "B002L5NYMS", "B0009P7EI2", "B000YPUFBA", "B0002S64SM", "B004B3254Q", "B007I1Q59E", "B00005JPX8", "B00007J5VT", "B008H1Q3QY", "B001AZJKKK", "B00000F7E6", "B00005JM48", "B000CSUNRU", "B000HIVIQU", "B00BWDYRS0", "B004SEUIXS", "B0084O26SI", "B00005BKZP", "B000MTEFP0", "B0007Z0NYQ", "B0002C4JIK", "B008JEJU5K", "B001JV5BA8", "B0000897B7", "B0002RQ316", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B000GBEWP2", "B00018QU4G", "B000B5XOWK", "B00AIBZLHS", "B001APM44O", "B00007L4OM", "B00FGVS07S", "B004XVMCLC", "B000E5LEV0", "B004NWPY3E", "B002VKB0M4", "B0081HLM2E", "B00005NB9Z", "B000296E7W", "B00BEIYM42", "B0009WFFWC", "B0012QE4PI", "B000274THQ", "B000085OY1", "B009B8YMB0", "B002LE8MGW", "B00005UQA2", "B006H0SWES", "B00EV1YZKK", "B001LMAK6A", "B002YBPR4C", "B00166UFA2", "B002AG2NV6", "B001NI6BJC", "B00008ZZ9E", "B0000E32V2", "B004YCKKIM", "B004YCKKH8", "B004XKVR3C", "1111354162", "B004ZJHSAM", "B0031SU2Y2", "B0045ZAQSM", "B00A92MEJY", "1572522135", "B00EPH8SBM", "B005E7SEK2", "B000KBB1IY", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B0009YVBGO", "1111835888", "B00005N89H", "B008CJ0JS4", "B00005NC66", "B000N3T0DW", "B002KECJZ8", "B0011KQSZ4", "B00HRJVHEK", "B0001NJZ70", "B00AZNEVNE", "B00003L9CI", "B000UVV26A"], "bought_together": ["B000SSQ7JC", "B001THZAAI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000A1HQP", "B001CIOCLC", "B001THZAAI", "B0087IT8FK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 49772}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 34.95, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005OSLQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C7W52V1rL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Closet"}

Then a  misunderstood joke leads to trouble, and the boys have to choose between loyalty  to family and their love for their dog.The Biscuit Eaterisn't one of  Disney's top films; by contemporary standards it's slow, and the emphasis on  hunting birds may upset young viewers. However, others may find its tale of  determination and racial harmony appealing.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001I55P6", "B00006675W", "B00006675U", "B004GV9B3G", "B00005JNF1", "B00287Z1FC", "B0001I55PQ", "B000AJJNIG", "B0000DZ3G5", "B0000DZ3EG", "B000069HP5", "B0001Z51LC", "B0050Z3N72", "B0001I55PG", "B0000DZTNF", "B003TNS3HC", "B00007GZZW", "B00005JN0Q", "B000B8QG2C", "B00077BPFU", "B0001I55YC", "B00006472U", "B00007GZZV", "B00077BPFA", "B00077BPGO", "B00077BPF0", "B0000DZTIT", "B0001I55XI", "B0001I55QA", "B0001I5628", "B001HDG8PU", "B00006675T", "B001BKKCHY", "B008H6GHG0", "B0007Z9QZ8", "B0001I55Q0", "B0001I55R4", "B007VOVTQC", "B0007Z9QYY", "B00006675V", "B00005T7H3", "B0071PT9B8", "B00005JLJC", "B001NP8WY2", "B0009X75QU", "B0001I55OW", "B00005JM6F", "B00007JMDX", "B0001I55Y2", "B0000DZ3EE", "B000B8QG2M", "B001NP8WYC", "B00007GZZU", "B001SXZ7TC", "B002EAYDM0", "B0000633U5", "B00005JL6I", "B00005RRG7", "B0000DZ3G3", "B000TPTCP0", "B0029JH4HW", "B008H6GH9W", "B001B73Q34", "B000Y11B7G", "B001TPGNBK", "B0001I55WO", "B0001I55RE", "B0000633U4", "B004UO62RM", "B005ZEU2SQ", "B005G82GT4", "B0050PZLBI", "B000065V3A", "B000E0ODKY", "B0069WB688", "B00287Z1ES", "B001E1HCR8", "B0002S64VO", "B001CUBF6A", "6304711913", "B000MP7RGI", "B000R4NOSY", "B000QUU7KW", "B0004Z322O", "B000JMK6OO", "B00A1AU64E", "B0000CDRW2", "B00006RCL9", "B00AEFYPHA", "0823423913", "B001JPQWSE", "B000056H2H", "B0019ESNGE", "B000065V3X", "B007RUZ29A", "B001B73Q20", "B00005JMVV"], "bought_together": ["B00006675W", "B0001I55P6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0050Z3N72", "B004GV9B3G", "B0001I55P6", "B00005JNF1"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 76219}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.72, "brand": "Walt Disney Video", "asin": "B00006675S", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B6C62E88L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Biscuit Eater"}

{"description": "The DVD set of theBack to the Futuretrilogy is as classy and  professional as the series. Both new and original materials are included in the  plethora of extras, starting with two sets of making-of documentaries. Each disc  has material on that particular film, and some features look at the trilogy as a  whole. Producer-writer Bob Gale is the star of the extra features, candidly  presenting the original ideas and many deleted scenes (a few with doses of crude  humor). Much of the inside stuff is repeated in the various pieces, but that's  to be expected with such exhaustive materials. Michael J. Fox chimes in with a  video commentary presented in a picture-in-picture format (which would have  worked better as a straight interview) and the producers tackle the main  commentary track, but the highlight audio commentary is a free-flowing Q&A; with  Gale and director Robert Zemeckis in front of a USC film-school audience.

{"description": "It is a sordid fact of life that were it not for Robert Blake's newfound infamy as an accused wife murderer,Baretta, which lasted from 1975 to 1978, might have been relegated to late nights in TV land. But as they say in Hollywood, there's no such thing as bad publicity. So here is this three-disc set containing all 12 episodes of the offbeat cop series' first season. Created by Stephen A. Cannell (whose eclectic credits range fromThe A-TeamandThe Great American HerotoThe Rockford FilesandWiseguy),Barettawas a tailor-made star vehicle for the pugnacious Blake. In light of his later situation, lines such as \"If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,\" \"You just pull the trigger and somebody dies,\" and \"Husbands have been known to sometimes kill their wives for money\" take on a grimly prophetic resonance. But as these episodes testify,Barettais more than a newly minted sick joke.Baretta is an undercover cop in the Serpico mode. Like your standard TV-issue rule-bending loner cop, he butts heads with his excitable superior (veteran character actor Dana Elcar ofMacGuyverandBaa Baa Black Sheepfame). He lives in the run-down King Edwards Motel with his scene-stealing pet cockatoo. He adopts a variety of guises (including in one episode, an elderly woman who looks like Tweety's keeper, Granny, and whose voiced was dubbed by Granny herself, June Foray!). But he is much randier than your average Joe Friday. In one episode, he tries to convince his date to go back to his apartment so she can give him his \"birthday present.\" She tells him \"that will take until 4 in the morning.\" With its ersatz funky score,Barettais time-capsule '70s television. And, as Baretta was fond of saying, you can take that to the bank.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006J6XI", "B00018D3RI", "B00005JNHT", "B00023GGAI", "B000A0GXGK", "B000LV6VZQ", "B002XKKX8E", "B000HEVZ7Q", "B00005JNHU", "B00005JO3P", "B000PMGS5E", "B005SQRYS2", "B0055CP9P4", "B000VS6R30", "B0007A0F4Y", "0615591949", "B001675ZJM", "B00HZMZ286", "B00803LRK6", "B000E1EHPY", "B000RZIGSQ", "B00008YLVB", "B006JN86V2", "B001675ZJ2", "B0030Y12AK", "B0077T5SG8", "B0014FAIVG", "B000BGR1B4", "B0062VL4YW", "B008JEJV2W", "B001UDPA9C", "B0089BSNQA", "B000LE16VC", "B00266PDZ8", "B00L1WJK2K", "B0077T5SOA", "B001FT4PEW", "B001E6HUW0", "B000YENUOK", "B000LXGXY8", "B00000F6RL", "B0002COTDA", "B000PGTPC8", "B005LFQRTC", "B007R915MO", "B000BF0C8E", "B0002NY8R6", "B000GW8UAE", "B00JEZWRE4", "B00IU6HPIQ", "B00JDCP0QA", "B001S86IZO", "B008X8U83K", "B00BDZV4OW", "B003RHZ6CK", "B008K1PWMW", "B007KW5M6I", "B00IXPWGIS", "B00AJXO48W", "B0087GKHXO", "B0096W46PS", "B000N2HD6O", "B00G5N6C8U", "B000XJD3K2", "B00AA8Q0JM", "B00B00HUC0", "B001675ZJW", "B000Q6GUJS", "B00C7A8WNS", "B00BBI7DU0", "B008OR5X6M", "B002WQ79A4", "B002LFQIL2", "B001JFKWE4", "B008R4LO6A", "B000MGBSQM", "B00008EY6N", "B000MGBSH6", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B000ATQYWY", "B00553K9NA", "B0007YMWFK", "B001JTRKHW", "B009DA74CK", "B002JIOOD0", "B007R915PG", "B0009UC80Q", "B000HWZ4HU", "B000O77SNG", "B0009UC80G", "B000LV6W00", "B000NJMJHA", "B00ESFUED6", "B000SMNK16", "B005FQ2HBO", "B000QUEQ6I", "B0011NVCA2", "B00CPR3RB0", "B000BOH8YG", "B00IS6WQ2S"], "bought_together": ["B00006J6XI", "B00018D3RI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00006J6XI", "B00023GGAI", "B00018D3RI", "B0007A0F4Y"]}, "price": 18.51, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 31270}, "asin": "B00006J6XH", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z5J327BKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Baretta - Season One"}

{"description": "The duke of York, nicknamed Bertie, was born as royal 'spare heir', younger brother to the prince of Wales, and thus expected to spend a relatively private life with his Scottish wife Elisabeth Bowes-Lyon and their daughters, in the shadow of their reigning father, George V, and next that of his elder brother who succeeded to the British throne as Edward VIII. However Edward decides to put his love for a divorced American, Wallis Simpson, above dynastic duty, and ends up abdicating the throne, which now falls to Bertie, who reigns as George VI. Now he expects to be, as constitutional monarch, little more then a figure head, but again faith has more in store for him: Nazi Germany proves such a formidable war challenger to the British Empire that the nearly desperate nation looks to its royal couple as comforting symbol of the unbroken spirit, a part they play with great success, while hosting chased monarchs and governments from continental Europe. After victory, life returns to normal, but pulmonary disease soon ends George's, leaving the throne to his still young firstborn, queen Elisabeth II. \n\n16:9 Anamorphic Wide Screen\nEnglish\nEnglish\nRegion 2\nDolby Digital Stereo English\nDolby Digital Stereo", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0054DPLUC", "B000NTM9ZW", "B00005O7N8", "B00015HXDG", "B001B1Q2UO", "B004XYOQU4", "B001C4AFOY", "B000EOTELI", "B00BHO0STG", "B00BXTH44C", "B0059XTV4Y", "0767827775", "B0056C1M2M", "B000EMGF2Q", "B000EHQUGC", "B000JLTS80", "B000RF7XYY", "B000A8AXXG", "B0001KL5M6", "B003UESJH4", "B004SIP98S", "B007I6LHN8", "B000Z8H0IC", "B003AND1SM", "B009L2EW5W", "B005DVIQ2K", "B00005JLJP", "B007TBJD1K", "B005B1A0VM", "B000ND91S6", "B001L57ZZG", "B00GM7STPI", "B0080QOL10", "B000BKDNX0", "B00GJT2OWS", "B007HW8U2Y", "B004JMSIQS", "B000GH3CQG", "B004XC5LQE", "B00342ANSA", "B00005AUJT", "B007A2O3FO", "B004GJYRLY", "B0000AQS3P", "B00BQXTDIU", "B003WEAVZU", "B001AZIRVI", "B002CWKTUA", "B00IK481FO", "B00336M8DK", "B003WEAVZK", "B000BITVAG", "B00GPWEPZ8", "B000E8QV74", "B0012IV3Q4", "B008UQUS26", "B00062IZ0Y", "B0046ZYEUW", "B000FL7C9G", "B005RJ6A5S", "B000V02CO6", "B00005JOA0", "B00J44G7H8", "B000E0ODZE", "B00HUAH14Q", "B000784WNQ", "B0013NAMLK", "B00A4E8E78", "B00F1BFRA6", "B0059XTUVI", "B003WEAW04", "B000G6BM0K", "B000RF7XYO", "B005VUTRGW", "B00IT3KP96", "B000M2E32M", "B000089QEM", "B000ZOXDFA", "B0099Y2MYK", "B004H1UAIA", "B007701RFS", "B00C888NRO", "0767812115", "0688035531", "B00DW5ILF6", "B00CIUGD8S", "B000TLTCPY", "B005S9EJ14", "B0059XTV7Q", "B00DL48BM6", "B00CLH0C1M", "B000GIXLUC", "B00JX3SHIC", "B00EF0NVGQ", "B00IKM5OTW", "0671218107", "B004FM2EL2", "B009T6CXG0", "B0090XUARQ", "B000EBD9VC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00015HXDG", "B001C4AFOY", "B00005O7N8", "B001B1Q2UO"]}, "price": 10.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 686382}, "asin": "B00006JY7C", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51W4HHEBERL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bertie and Elizabeth"}
{"description": "On March 12, 2002,The Shieldburst onto the FX network like an incendiary grenade, and basic cable TV would never be the same. Creator Shawn Ryan's uncompromising police drama pushed the limits of basic-cable permissiveness, bridging the relative discretion ofNYPD Blueand the HBO liberties ofThe Wire. Without exception, these 13 episodes justify their hype, focusing on pugnacious detective Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis), whose amoral Strike Team employs dubious tactics in the crime-ridden (and fictional) Farmington district of Los Angeles. Mackey and his maverick partners are at odds with seasoned detectives and beat cops, escalating tensions with precinct Capt. Aceveda (Benito Martinez), a Latino with flexible scruples and a political agenda.The series invites viewers to form their own judgments regarding Mackey's volatile behavior, which includes killing an undercover cop in the electrifying pilot episode. While each episode stands alone as groundbreaking drama, the arc of the series incorporates Aceveda's campaign to end Mackey's career; the self-loathing of a homosexual rookie (Michael Jace) whose partner (Catherine Dent) is Mackey's occasional mistress; a straight-laced detective (Jay Karnes) yearning for respect; Mackey's compassionate attempt to rehabilitate a crack whore (Jamie Brown, giving the season's finest guest performance); the autism of Mackey's young son and the recklessness of his closest partner (Walton Goggins); and the vigilant stoicism of Det. Wyms (CCH Pounder), who's as sensibly upright as Mackey is corrupted.Teeming with gang-bangers, perverts, rapists, and killers,The Shieldis unabashedly adult; even liberal viewers may flinch at plots involving child pornography and serial murder. Chiklis deservedly won an Emmy for maintaining the series' delicate morality; Mackey's a hero squirming in his own ethical quicksand.

{"description": "This gentle, low-key comedy follows a female civil servant of an Islamic country (presumably Iran, but specifics aren't given) as she travels around a sparsely populated island, trying to get the inhabitants to vote on election day. Her efforts are both helped and hindered by the reluctant soldier who has been assigned to accompany her--but far more significant hurdles are language barriers, deep-seated gender prejudices, and mechanical breakdowns. The civil servant struggles to maintain her faith in democratic processes in the face of indifference, antagonism, and absurdity. When someone tells her, \"Voting doesn't catch fish,\" she has no reply, yet perseveres in her attempt to make the world better.Secret Ballotis slow-paced, but the movie's rhythms suit the world it depicts.

{"description": "Charlie Chaplin's final film is a delightful romantic comedy, filled with clever touches for which he's famous. Written, directed and composed by Chaplin, it revolves around Russian emigre countess Natascha (Sophia Loren), forced into prostitution in Hong Kong, who stows away in wealthy American Ogden's (Marlon Brando's) stateroom to blackmail her way to the States. Since Ogden has a mind of his own, and can even resist Natascha's charms, what follows is one of the funniest tugs of war ever devised! A wealth of talent supports the stars. There's Chaplin's Son, Sydney, as Brando's cruise companion, Tippi Hedren as his icy wife, Patrick Cargill as the ultimate gentleman's gentleman, and Margaret Rutherford as a dotty old dame. Chaplin himself tops it off with a cameo as the ship's steward! The gags are pure Charlie and his actors make the most of them, sailing in and out of slamming doors - and outrageous situations - with ease.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004I1K066", "B004R4PWYY", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B0002PYSYM", "B000062XF1", "B0006FO8M0", "B00017LVQE", "B0002ERWZU", "B0016MLIL6", "B008FYZJ2C", "B000096IBG", "B0006FO8L6", "B00BTYJYMQ", "B001139ZGA", "B003ODIV0G", "B004I1K05W", "B00EI2CUN6", "B00017LVMS", "B000BB14ZS", "B00017LVLE", "B00K6J7Q6G", "B000WMFZMY", "B003WH765U", "B008FYZIEQ", "1572525509", "B00BMEF6ZC", "B00ICWO1LC", "B0001NBMI0", "B0006D3HCY", "B000059ZTM", "B0001FGC1U", "B00008MTYC", "B00G92TYDW", "B00096S4DA", "B00009IB1H", "B00JXVNVRG", "B000ARFPRG", "B005BQQDAO", "B000E6ESWG", "B00JPQ1IJM", "B007N5YJPC", "B001FBNQYA", "B0002HOEPS", "B003YBNNMY", "B0007QJ1Y8", "B000E6ESXK", "B006A8XFSA", "B00083FZFE", "B001BRZ5E2", "B0043BORJM", "B00008CMRN", "B00AQ6J5I6", "B0001AGI46", "B003ZYU3TG", "B00009AOBP", "B00017LVN2", "B0002B15Y2", "B00480OBXA", "B00125WAXM", "B000KHI2FS", "B0002AL62Y", "B000F4TMIW", "B00FNR9ZKG", "B0007QS2ZC", "B006TTC5WC", "B0000DJZ8Q", "B00AQ6J56S", "B000HA4WSO", "B004VUNVEM", "B0002HMKG8", "B00AEFXFW6", "B000LPG1KM", "B00000JRW5", "B0052YDMZE", "B00ABMAIM2", "B00074DY16", "B00BY8DAAE", "B000CCW2UC", "1612191924", "B00006L92Y", "B002EAYE4W", "B00008AOWJ", "B0008ENHU8"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFY8ZE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004R4PWYY", "B004I1K066", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B0002PYSYM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 84477}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.25, "brand": "UNIVERSAL", "asin": "B00007GZR3", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51V5APA9Y9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Countess From Hong Kong"}
{"description": "It's a flimsy excuse to romp through more than two dozen Irving Berlin songs, butBlue Skiesis good fun nonetheless (and one of the top-grossing films of 1946). Bing Crosby is a restless nightclub entrepreneur, Fred Astaire his Broadway buddy, Joan Caulfield the woman they both want. Ignore the plot and enjoy the numbers, especially Astaire's marvelous \"Puttin' on the Ritz,\" which is breathtaking even before multiple images of Fred are introduced dancing in a row (who needs CGI, anyway?). Bing and Fred flash great showbiz chutzpah in \"A Couple of Song and Dance Men,\" which wonderfully captures the appeal of both stars:  Fred's heavenly precision, and Bing's \"can-you-believe-they're-payin'-me-for-this?\" sense of play.Bing Crosby founds the first white Dixieland band inBirth of the Blues, a tuneful turn-of-the-century tale--if highly suspect as musical history. Borrowing hot licks from black musicians (Eddie \"Rochester\" Anderson comments, \"Our music sure has gone highbrow\"), Bing and his players struggle to invade the straight-laced clubs, succeeding only after songbird Mary Martin joins the band. Martin, in one of her infrequent movie appearances, has fun with Der Bingle jazzing up \"Wait Till the Sun Shines, Nellie,\" a highlight of this breezily enjoyable nonsense.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00007J5VQ", "B00007J5VS", "B0041T50J2", "B000HA4WRU", "B00004VVMZ", "B000EBD9S0", "B0015FGCI8", "B0001LJCRA", "B007MDR7R2", "B000EBD9SK", "B00008AOWK", "B00000F9GK", "B0007939MK", "B0058KCMF8", "B000BZISTY", "B000I0QL82", "B004T4XRDU", "B0001FGBZW", "B00008AOWJ", "B004GJYR50", "B0009NSCPS", "B005F265IE", "B00008DDRU", "B000KJTGHO", "B0002HODP4", "B00009ZPU1", "B0001DCYUK", "B00406UJZG", "B000PAAK5A", "B000KJTBZG", "B0001ZWLSS", "0061567566", "B000H6SXSS", "B0029776Y0", "B00K8CQ1Q2", "B000EBGE5U", "B00005ALMH", "B000EBD9RG", "B0001FR55C", "B00KIZY3XW", "B000GETTIO", "B000J0NXXW", "B0002B15RE", "B0017I79BW", "B000F7CMPO", "B00005JNA9", "B00GXKZQIM", "B00JK322I6", "B00143XE28", "B000AP04LK", "B004132I3O", "B000EBD9SA", "B0002ERWZ0", "B00AATGDY8", "B00F6SHECS", "B0017IAIGU", "B00347AIMG", "B008M4C1BC", "B000A6T1I6", "B00007GZR4", "B003XXCC8E", "B00143XDYC", "B0024FAG1M", "B0009NSCQW", "B003GOP0D4", "B0024FAG1C", "B0009NSCQM", "B002MU4NN6", "B0017I3X9E", "B00FEFOK4I", "B00008AOWL", "6301423933", "B00IF0KASY", "B005F265FW", "B00IELX388", "B0062Z0PIO", "B0007939M0", "B00EKGXA84", "B0002OXVD2", "B002SUS3IQ", "B008RO6PIM", "B00KIZY0EE", "B00BGGIXZQ", "B0013LL2XE", "B005STRNQ2", "B0009NSCQ2", "B000K7VHNM", "B000085EFE", "B00GJT1ZPU", "B0062Z0PDO", "B00005UMFC", "B00143XDZG", "B00B27WSOQ", "B00GTSVO1G", "B00005Y71M", "B00DVPMYWI", "B0090XLDKY", "B00005UMFB", "B0045HCJQM", "B00KGLS050"], "bought_together": ["B00007J5VS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0041T50J2", "B00007J5VS", "B0015FGCI8", "B00007J5VQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 46730}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.7, "brand": "UNIVERSAL", "asin": "B00007J5VP", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NS7GBYS3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Birth Of The Blues/Blue Skies - Double Feature"}
{"description": "With a new time slot (8:00 p.m. Saturdays) and three first-season  Emmys&#xAE;,All in the Familywas primed for greatness, and these 24 episodes  represent the series at its best. Carroll O'Connor leads the perfect cast as  blue-collar bigot Archie Bunker, and the standout classic is \"Sammy's Visit,\" in  which black, Jewish rat-packer Sammy Davis Jr. visits the Bunker home, where  he's hilariously horrified by Archie's prejudicial ignorance. The script was  written by comedian Bill (\"Jos&#xE9; Jiminez\") Dana, and to borrow Archie's phrase,  it's a pip, as Sammy turns Archie's racist remarks on their ear to the delight  of young liberals Gloria (Sally Struthers) and husband Mike (Rob Reiner).  Sammy's parting kiss on Archie's cheek is one of the series' all-time  highlights. Then there's Burt Styler's Emmy-winning script for \"Edith's  Problem,\" in which Archie's \"Dingbat\" wife experiences the mood swings of  menopause (another first, along with impotence in \"Mike's Problem,\" in the  series' taboo-busting candor). A showcase for Jean Stapleton (who deservedly won  her second consecutive Emmy), it also demonstrates (as does \"Archie and Edith  Alone\") the hurtful repercussions of Archie's unintentional cruelty. Edith's  Archie-baiting cousin Maude (Bea Arthur) is introduced (\"Maude\" is a pilot for  the character's spin-off sitcom, which premiered in '72), and creditmustbe given to John Rich, who directed all 24 episodes (winning an Emmy for  \"Sammy's Visit\") with a flawless sense of ensemble chemistry, precision timing,  and lasting political relevance. This season earned seven Emmys overall,  including awards for O'Connor and Struthers. Given such a wealth of sitcom  glory, it's a shame these DVDs are devoid of retrospective features.--Jeff  Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002E58FT2", "B002E58FUG", "B002E58FTM", "B002E58FTC", "B002E58FU6", "B000TD2KY2", "B000255LG6", "B000TD0PHG", "B005KK2FTO", "B00465I13S", "B00008R9MC", "B00007KK5J", "B000068V9Y", "B000CCBCCG", "B000068V9X", "B000MGTQ6G", "B00008EY6N", "B0007OCG74", "B0000BV1XX", "B000YGGNGK", "B00IJZW35I", "B001DSNEME", "B00005JLIC", "B000AMJG5I", "B000MGBSH6", "B00GOC760U", "B000A0GXGK", "B001OXLGK0", "B0000B1A5A", "B00096S480", "B00007KK5I", "B0000DFZ5O", "B00008NV4G", "B0002NY8R6", "B000286S42", "B0001O3YHQ", "B000NJMJHA", "B00GLT2SOA", "B000G0O5JG", "B002JH2EJM", "B000QUEQ6I", "B008L36520", "B0001NBNIY", "B00D2UMHB0", "B00GOC74OI", "B000BOH8YQ", "B000B5XOTS", "B00DJYK1XU", "B0002Y4T7O", "B0002W4SX6", "B00D2UMHSI", "B0002JZT5U", "B000A9QKSM", "B000A0GOQ4", "B000MEYKAA", "B000EGDAO8", "B000YKYT1M", "B000CELOW2", "B0085Z6Z2O", "B0011N19HI", "B000WQWPSW", "B001DMVZJ4", "B000291Q3Y", "B00009VRF0", "B0000E32X2", "B008KZX7W0", "B0085Z6ZD8", "B0001AVZDU", "B001DMVZJO", "B00A2L1CJK", "B0007Y08P6", "B000PHX5KU", "B00005JO3P", "B00D2UMI7I", "B00000F5W8", "B000HIVIOM", "B0007WQHFS", "B0006IUDYY", "B00008EYBH", "B000K7UBXE", "B000BVM1TG", "B008K1PWMW", "B0058J3S16", "B0009B16TO", "B0000V4906", "B008VNI9EW", "B0007KTBJO", "B0002NY8PI", "B007JVM69Q", "B002FLOTFO", "B00FM4S7P4", "B000E1MXWI", "B00IP965IO", "B009V2KO9K", "B0001ZMWXW", "B000KGGIL4", "B000EBGFQI", "B000BITV1A", "B00FFARI7I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002E58FT2", "B008HUSFTS", "B002E58FTM", "B000WN5DYS"]}, "price": 10.29, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 91142}, "asin": "B00007KK5K", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nSvglNU8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "All in the Family - The Complete Second Season"}

But he triumphantly returns to Oscar-worthy status with his moving performance as Radio, a mentally challenged young man, whom South Carolina high school football coach Harold Jones (Ed Harris) takes under his nurturing wing. This does not play well with the school's patient but questioning principal (Alfre Woodard); the school's biggest athletic booster, who views Radio as a distraction; the man's son, the team's star player, who plays cruel pranks on the trusting Radio; and the Coach's teenage daughter, who feels neglected. Almost all will be won over by Radio's trusting and good nature. Based on aSports Illustratedstory,Radiowas adapted for the screen by Mike Rich, screenwriter ofThe Rookie, and as in that superior family film, the heroics are mostly off the field. As Coach says, with all the subtlety of a blitz, \"We're not the ones been teaching Radio; he's the one been teaching us.\" The ending, in which we see the actual Radio, still cheering his team on 26 years later, will melt the most cynical hearts.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JPBO", "B002VECM6S", "B000056VP4", "B000066HAS", "B00004W221", "B000J3OTT6", "B000EXZFCQ", "0792843592", "6305531293", "B00AEFXOKO", "B000068NNU", "B001LGXIA6", "B002NZK5UK", "0788815466", "B000KHYN9C", "6305428352", "B0001US66Y", "B000N6U0E2", "B00000IQV7", "B00004TJQJ", "B002D755AI", "B00125WAWS", "B0006FYOTC", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00005JNEW", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00KPYT9PS", "B000FVQLQQ", "B000KLQUS0", "B0068FZ0GK", "B000Q7ZNZ4", "B002VWNIBI", "B000K2UGZM", "B001FB55NK", "B004KPLVX6", "B00722MQE2", "B0026S2TU8", "B004DK5CW4", "B0001ADAVK", "630542845X", "B00005JKWX", "B000CDSS18", "B0000YTP02", "B00006HAWN", "B00AEFZ63M", "6305133468", "B00AEFXOE0", "B009NNM9OA", "B000MNOX94", "B000PHVZNE", "B00AEFY17E", "B000G1R394", "B001QB5SS6", "B005OZVXCU", "B000FVR1T2", "B0000AM6NV", "B002YMWQ2M", "B002VWNICM", "B0023UZBBI", "B009YQJ2Q4", "B00005JMCN", "B0026JI1R2", "B0002TSZI8", "B000KF0GWW", "078324021X", "6305428387", "B0038M2AZA", "B008FCX2D2", "B000QQLVPQ", "0767836359", "0783225733", "B000X5RBXG", "B004SEUJOQ", "B00KD5HFJG", "B00AMEZDJW", "B00AEFXV3E", "B000RBA6C4", "B00AEFXY6I", "0767802497", "B000FFJYB6", "B000274T94", "B0000648ZR", "B00133KFGW"], "bought_together": ["B002VECM6S", "B000056VP4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000X5RBXG", "B000056VP4", "B000J3OTT6", "B00005JPBO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 13680}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "Team Marketing", "asin": "B00008EY60", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510370Y4VYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Radio"}
{"description": "TheIdentityDVD features are not quite as enticing as they sound.  Of chief interest is the extended branched version of the film (available in widescreen only), but there's only one added scene (an interesting but not critical minute-long sequence that would have been the first conference-room scene), and the differences in the alternate ending are so subtle that you'll miss them if you literally blink a few times.  There's no question it could affect audience perception, but unlike most alternate endings, it doesn't affect the actual outcome.  (Seespoilerfor more information.)  The four deleted scenes (which don't include either of the above-mentioned additions) aren't that exciting, and the optional director commentary notes that these deletions generally served to cut moments of character and comic relief in favor of moving the story along, which is one reason the film runs a brisk 90 minutes. James Mangold's director commentary on the feature is good, though, as he discusses such matters as the logistics of the perpetual downpour and a crucial bit of dialogue removed from the film's climax.  Considering that downpour and the contrasting darks and lights of the film, picture quality is good, and the thunder claps sound great in 5.1 sound so there are no complaints about the DVD's presentation of the film itself.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000TJ6PBK", "B00006AUJR", "B0009YA3OA", "B000DZ7YN8", "B00005JNY3", "B00AADAK5W", "1558908382", "B00008K77D", "B0002DB54A", "B000RGN2JI", "B00AEBB8NI", "B000P0I4O4", "B00003CXZ4", "B004ZNFTDQ", "B0015XHQVC", "B00026ZD04", "B00014NEZI", "B003LR5BD0", "B00092ZLSK", "B004SIP92O", "B00000JGHL", "B003VA3JUO", "B00BNH9NCU", "B00DZP1C2W", "B00I45844W", "B004YCKKFK", "B00011CZRE", "B0002234LS", "B001HVZOB6", "B005S9EJ8W", "B000A2UBN4", "B00HOGBXS6", "B000OYC7BW", "B0004Z31OS", "B00AEBB89W", "B00AEFXW8I", "B00009OWJY", "B002NZK5RI", "B00AEFXEGS", "B00007AJF8", "B003ASLJQ8", "B000R4SMCW", "B000069HZP", "B00003CXGA", "B00005V9HH", "B0001FR3IQ", "B00005JPT0", "B000SK5Z20", "B00008YJDK", "B0013D8LBS", "6305238065", "B0021L8UFI", "B004P7CN7W", "078322799X", "B001OQCV2E", "B0002WT4OE", "B00B6OEB18", "B00003CXKM", "B004SIP9RO", "B000RZIGUE", "B004B3PBFQ", "B004LWZW24", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00096S49Y", "B000LC55F2", "0783240295", "B00009L1TA", "B0034G4P30", "B002O3Z4WK", "B00005JLO8", "B001ILFUBE", "B00005JKIS", "B004SIP9MY", "6305718954", "B000ALM40I", "B0001Z52RU", "B0010X73ZG", "B000A5045Q", "B00005JMWP", "B00005JN2Z", "B000F5WR4W", "B0000648X0", "B0021L8UPS", "B00AEBBA2W", "6301971345", "B002UJIY7A", "B0006IIKQW", "B00B96TGQS", "B004BLJQOK", "B00AEFXKZ8", "6304806434", "B001NPD9LS", "B000U1ZV76", "B003L20IEW", "B00596WFE4", "B000GCFO0I", "B00005UQ9W", "B000053UIF", "B0000YTOL2"], "bought_together": ["B000TJ6PBK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000TJ6PBK", "B0012Q7M02", "B00006AUJR", "B00AEBBA2W"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30202}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.73, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00008EY9G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RKTbv5kkL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Identity"}

{"description": "For years, animation buffs have waited impatiently for the Warner Bros.  cartoons to appear on DVD. The Warner shorts never commanded the budgets and  prestige of the Disney and MGM films, and won fewer Oscars than they deserved. But  decades after the best ones were created, they remain the quintessential  Hollywood cartoons: brash, fast-paced, aggressively funny and uniquely American.  Virtually everyone in the U.S. under the age of 60 grew up on these films, in  theaters and on TV. The 56 cartoons in the set (out of a studio output of over 1,000) were  transferred from good prints--which means the viewer can see dust, scratches, and  occasional mistakes by the cel painters. The films are all presented uncut, in  defiance of the killjoys who have insisted on censoring alleged \"violence\" in  the versions shown on television. Warner Bros. is obviously testing consumer response with this set. Although  the erratic selection includes many classics, purists will argue (correctly)  that it offers neither a fair representation of the directors'oeuvres,  nor anything approaching a coherent history of the characters or studio style.   (Nearly half the films were directed by Chuck Jones; only three are by Bob  Clampett, and there's nothing by Tex Avery or Frank Tashlin.)  But it seems petty to carp about omissions and biases when the discs offer  excellent, uncensored prints of some of the funniest films ever made in the  U.S.--or anywhere else. (Rated G, suitable for all ages: cartoon violence)--Charles Solomon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00020SK1Y", "B000ADS62G", "B000HC2LGM", "B000TSTEM8", "B001CO42CA", "B004176JHQ", "B0058O1FIY", "B004L9GM5S", "B0002MFGCI", "B000ZOXDK0", "B003U0AHGE", "B005LOBWA2", "B0000AYJXV", "B000PC1PAW", "B001CO42CK", "B007KW5MJU", "B0093I9114", "B000R7GKPU", "B000AOEMUA", "B00BTJTYB2", "B0033XKV96", "B000TSTEMI", "B001VEF7ZM", "B000ADS61M", "B0001CNQUS", "B003WOW5HW", "B0002ZMHVI", "B0007939QG", "B000P296AS", "B002GNOLY0", "B0001CNQVM", "B000HC2LGW", "B005DMHHHY", "B000FQIRYU", "B000AOEMTG", "B00009PJT0", "B001QU880M", "B0002ABU5C", "B000MTPA5Y", "B000A345C6", "B0000BWVAG", "B0002NY8XA", "B000ADS62Q", "B000E3L7FK", "B00961ENYI", "B0002I837M", "B0002VNYI2", "B005NFJAQC", "B00CX0KKLO", "B008N8A3JE", "B00080ZFZC", "B000AXWGRM", "B00005M989", "B00465I1BA", "B000AXWGRC", "B00AMSM9CW", "B000FS9MVA", "B000ROAK2W", "B00003CXG7", "B00E9ZATKI", "B0089J2818", "B00CMY3JBO", "B00009M9BK", "B00H1HYZ9C", "B0050MB5AC"], "bought_together": ["B00020SK1Y", "B000ADS62G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005NFJAQC", "B007KW5MJU", "B0000AYJXV", "B00020SK1Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8766}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 38.98, "brand": "Looney Tunes", "asin": "B0000AYJXS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CO0b8nmIL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Looney Tunes: Golden Collection, Vol. 1"}

In the face of impossible odds, his brave ambition to become a professional photographer becomes a window into his world ... and ultimately his way out!", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001CDFY2I", "B004SIP6I6", "B005TZFYUM", "B00000F5KH", "B002W2U8V0", "B00022FW4U", "B0002LJTIG", "B00005N8A9", "B003N2CVOU", "B000J3OTOG", "B0036TGSJE", "B00075YVTE", "B002FHGESI", "B002BWP3UC", "B004SEUIXS", "0767802519", "6305313687", "B000056C0E", "B0002TT0MI", "B000FC2FX8", "B00AEBB9CS", "B005TZFZLA", "B001P9KR8U", "B000GNOGWE", "B000FIHNHU", "B00003CXZ4", "B000N6TX1I", "B004SIP7TE", "B004EBT81I", "B00AEFXESQ", "B000JRYOPG", "B0057ZAA6W", "B000P0J09M", "B000O76ZQC", "B000093FLA", "B00005JNCZ", "B000GGSMC6", "B000M341QE", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0007NBJHI", "B0007PALZ2", "B00005JL57", "B00375LBM6", "B000A7DVR2", "B00011CZRE", "B00005V9HH", "B0041KKYF6", "B005FUTBWS", "0767830555", "B004FQX5B6", "B00DHN8G3U", "B00007KQ9V", "B0009S2T0M", "B00195FU82", "B00005QAPH", "B00005Q4CS", "B00004Y7CZ", "B000067IZ3", "B004XQO8MS", "B000C20VPA", "B002CPMB9O", "B004ED52XE", "B000286RP2", "B00080Z53O", "B003Y5H4R0", "B00AEBB9NM", "B00023P4N8", "B004SIP93S", "B00005JN7C", "1558908390", "B006L4MWVE", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEFXGIY", "B00008975Z", "B000YENUI6", "B00008AOX5", "B00006G8G3", "B003T1KLFG", "B004SIP8ZM", "B0006GAOJA", "B003XURDAY", "B004SIP7ZS", "B004SIP88Y", "B004SIP8W0", "B0000YEE6M", "B000OVLBGC", "B002BWP4A6", "B003ASLJQS", "B00003W8NT", "B000LC55F2", "B0002KQOH6", "B000UJ48SQ", "B004G7XCRQ", "B00008ZZ9E", "B000C20VRS", "B000CNESTE", "B001QX010O", "B002ZG980U", "0802170102", "B000P0J0EW"], "bought_together": ["B001CDFY2I", "B005TZFYUM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001P42Y3G", "0767802519", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000O76ZQC"]}, "price": 15.59, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 80085}, "asin": "B0000D9PNX", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51hFOMyvZKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "City of God"}
{"description": "This perfectly pleasant, if minor, coming-of-age comedy-drama is the second feature released via the Miramax/HBO/Ben Affleck-Matt Damon TV programProject Greenlight. Series viewers watchedHeightsdirectors Kyle Rankin and Efram Potelle struggle to get their vision of screenwriter Erica Beeney's story past an intractable producer. If the process was not pretty, the final result--i.e., this film--has some nice things. Leading the list is rising star Shia LaBeouf (Holes) as likable, 17-year-old misfit Kelly Ernswiler, coasting through life and fascinated by simulated war games. He befriends a sweet but cynical preppie, Bart Bowland (Elden Hensen), whose sexy older sister, Tabby (Amy Smart), offers Kelly a glimpse of adult passions and heartache. The cast is strong, including Kathleen Quinlan and William Sadler as the Caulfield-esque hero's troubled parents. There are solid moments of comedy and affecting, better-than-average drama.

{"description": "The sixth season ofBuffy the Vampire Slayerfollowed the logic of plot and character development into some gloomy places. The year begins with Buffy being raised from the dead by the friends who miss her, but who fail to understand that a sacrifice taken back is a sacrifice negated. Dragged out of what she believes to have been heavenly bliss, she finds herself \"going through the motions\" and entering into a relationship with the evil, besotted vampire Spike just to force her emotions.  Willow becomes ever more caught up in the temptations of magic; Xander and Anya move towards marriage without ever discussing their reservations; Giles feels he is standing in the way of Buffy's adult independence; Dawn feels neglected. What none of them need is a menace that is, at this point, simply annoying--three high school contemporaries who have turned their hand to magical and high-tech villainy. Added to this is a hungry ghost, an invisibility ray, an amnesia spell and a song-and-dance demon (who acts as rationale for the incomparable musical episode \"Once More, with Feeling\").This is a year in which chickens come home to roost: everything from the villainy of the three geeks to Xander's doubts about marriage come to a head, often--as in the case of the impressive wedding episode--through wildly dark humor. The estrangement of the characters from each other--a well-observed portrait of what happens to college pals in their early 20s--comes to a shocking head with the death of a major character and that death's apocalyptic consequences. The series ends on a consoling note which it has, by that point and in spite of imperfections, entirely earned.--Roz Kaveney", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EHSVN2", "B000EHSVM8", "B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVLE", "B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVKK", "B000I0QLRI", "B000I0QLRS", "B000I0QLS2", "B000I0QLQY", "B000I0QLR8", "B007H9CNOI", "B000HD1482", "B003YF9Q08", "1593078226", "B00006J3WH", "B0006IUE16", "B0009W5J4Q", "B002JVWR4U", "B000ERVJM2", "B000GG4Y6O", "B000JLTRIG", "B000CCBCGM", "1595825584", "1595826106", "B000B5XOW0", "B00001R3O1", "B0024FAR66", "B001FB4W0C", "B00AMDA2QC", "1595821651", "B005CM1IIE", "B000OIOPHC", "B006LG74Q0", "B00JF5G8WU", "159307963X", "B00344EAQO", "B0000AQS0F", "B00466H3CW", "B002U8XW9Q", "B000X5SPBI", "1595824154", "B000BOH990", "B000BOH98G", "1595823425", "B00133QNSG", "B003R4ZMN6", "B00511N79O", "B000O77SN6", "B008EVT42W", "B000BOH986", "B000CNE0SS", "B009LDCXNY", "B0002XVKMM", "B000RO6JYK", "B00076ONT6", "B009LDCWWG", "B00IWTVDUW", "B000FP2OPY", "B006LG74RE", "B000R7GKQE", "B0010YSD7M", "B00243FQFA", "B000O77SMW", "1442412097", "B003R0MF7G", "B002JVWRAO", "B009LDD4V4", "B001MVWRNO", "B001AQO43M", "0789326302", "B000JW1TYU", "B000AO9BSS", "1595823107", "B004YM6JLO", "B0000C9JFQ", "B0006J28E6", "B001RXDM2C", "B000EXDS3E", "B005PPMHO2", "B00466H3CC", "B0058YPGL6", "B00133QNS6", "B00006FD9N", "B001992NWO", "B0001O3YLM", "1595829229", "B00A8KJN8M", "B003L77GAQ", "B00133QNRW", "B00005JNOG", "B001MVWRNE", "B00AMDA2P8", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B000G1R4TS", "B0077PTWHI", "B001QE99AQ", "B000EXDS34", "B00344EAKA", "B001M5UDGS"], "bought_together": ["B000EHSVN2", "B000EHSVM8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EHSVM8", "B000EHSVLY", "B0046XG48O", "B000EHSVLE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 112363}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 34.59, "brand": "", "asin": "B0000DANYD", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417707V8Z5L._SX300_.jpg", "title": "Buffy The Vampire Slayer - The Complete Sixth Season"}
{"description": "Even under the heavy censorship of 1946 Hollywood, Lana Turner and John Garfield's libidinous desires burn up the screen in Tay Garnett's adaptation of James M. Cain's torrid crime melodrama. Platinum blond Turner is Cora, a restless sexpot stuck in a roadside diner married to mundane middle-aged fry cook Nick Smith (Cecil Kellaway) when handsome drifter Frank (Garfield) blows her way. It's lust at first sight, a rapacious desire that neither can break off, and before long they're plotting his demise--but in the wicked world of Cain nothing is that easy. Garnett's visual approach is subdued compared to the more expressionistic film noir of the period, but he's at no loss when he films the luminous Turner in her milky-white wardrobe. She radiates repressed sexuality and uncontrollable passion while Garfield's smart-talking loner Frank mixes street-smart swagger and scrappy toughness with vulnerability and sincere intensity. Costar Hume Cronyn cuts a cold, calculating figure as their conniving lawyer, a chilly character that only increases our feelings for the murderous couple, victims of an all consumingamour fouthat drives their passions to extremes.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001KXZGNW", "B001KXZGOG", "B002GSXKPQ", "B0087ZG7OI", "B002GSXKQA", "B007FQXEVY", "B001KXZGO6", "079073219X", "B003UN2IAY", "B008D1Q1VU", "B008D1R52Y", "B005F265CU", "B005EVY8MQ", "B007FQXEQO", "B008D1R52E", "B00004XPPK", "B000FFJYAW", "B002VWNIAY", "B001D8W7EK", "B003UN2I4K", "B0047BXQZY", "B0045HCJ9E", "B0008ENIAC", "B0049985XW", "B00871C09S", "B004H83IFU", "B00406UJZG", "B00AEBB97S", "B006H37PXY", "B0080JG2GE", "B00023P4GA", "B00AEFXD1O", "B000BQ5IXW", "B00AEBBA7W", "B0001HAGTW", "B008D1Q1TM", "B000FFJYAC", "B000244EYW", "B00007ELD1", "B0045HCJHG", "B001D8W7EU", "B00AEBB89C", "B00AEFXRWO", "B004UOHNCA", "B00005A0QS", "B00DNQM7N6", "B00023P4II", "B000CC1TNI", "B000FFJYAM", "B002945DUW", "B000ECX0O2", "B0087ZG7R0", "B005H8G78O", "B003B3V0RA", "B000087F79", "B0086IMNRQ", "B001PO54V0", "B004XKVP7K", "B000244EWO", "B000B8384Q", "B0024FAG80", "B00006RCO1", "B000025RE7", "B006H37P2K", "B0007ZEO8C", "B00466JALY", "B000FFJYA2", "B00004W229", "B00DBE97S8", "B0050FXDDQ", "B00005RDRL", "B00027JYLM", "B00AMSQBNK", "B008BSM1XC", "B00008LDNZ", "B000CNE088", "B004UOHNAC", "B0006HBV3C", "B00553K8DQ", "B00005JKF6", "B00AEFXN9G", "B0008ENID4", "B00023P4FQ", "B0035Q636Q", "B000PKG7CU", "B0000549B0", "B00003CXBU", "B0047BXR1C", "B00012L786", "B006FE83UE", "B00006RCO2", "B00BQ412GU", "B001PO550A", "B000244F2S", "B000EXDSBQ", "B000PMFRVU", "B00AATGDW0", "B0006HBV28", "B003ZEQMH8", "B0006Z2NE0"], "bought_together": ["B001KXZGNW", "B001KXZGOG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001KXZGNW", "B003ZEQMH8", "B008D1Q1VU", "B005F265CU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 36043}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0000EYUCU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CHTNvd9UL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Postman Always Rings Twice"}

{"description": "It sounds likeLove Story, but with an intriguing twist. 23-year-old wife and mom Sarah Polley has spent her entire life sacrificing for others and living on the economic fringe; when she discovers she has only a few months to live, she resolves to keep the news secret. In her remaining time, she plots a course for various unfinished plans and deferred dreams:  write a journal, leave future messages for her kids, make a stranger (Mark Ruffalo) fall in love with her. Obviously, the danger of sentimentality lurks in director Isabel Coixet's concept, and the film does have a few soggy moments. Some critics lost patience with the main character's seeming selfishness (a good post-movie conversation starter). Yet there is something powerful in her insistence on claiming a small piece of existence exclusively for herself. Polley (Guinevere) gives a typically honest performance, with fine support by Scott Speedman and Deborah Harry.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000NJWIPI", "B000066JBR", "B000T5O48A", "B00005MKKV", "B008NA3I30", "B001QERPAC", "B0000844LU", "B00FXWAZW8", "B0002IQE2I", "0780622251", "B004QL7KKC", "B00AEFXESQ", "0767835093", "B00005T30L", "B004A8ZWV0", "B00000F7E6", "B00AKGG6JS", "B002K2KMJA", "B00DEKKEPO", "B0051GLDVS", "B00H9HZITU", "B0036TGSJE", "B00E8G5GU6", "B00003CWTI", "B00BLN4UDS", "B009AJB0YM", "B002AS463W", "B00005YUPC", "0767802519", "B001OQCV1K", "B006KH6CF4", "B0014D5RBE", "B004SIP6GI", "B00FRILRYS", "0800141806", "B003NKU9AK"], "bought_together": ["B000NJWIPI", "B000066JBR"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00A81MV3U", "B000NJWIPI", "B0000ZMGWK", "B00009MEJ6"]}, "price": 9.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 89272}, "asin": "B00013WWSY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WK3YG5EFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "My Life Without Me"}

{"description": "As upscale sitcoms go,Something's Gotta Givehas more to offer than most romantic comedies. Obviously working through some semi-autobiographical issues regarding \"women of a certain age,\" writer-director Nancy Meyers brings adequate credibility and above-average intelligence to what is essentially (but not exclusively) a fantasy premise, in which an aging lothario who's always dated younger women (Jack Nicholson, more or less playing himself) falls for a successful middle-aged playwright (Diane Keaton) who's convinced she's past the age of romance, much less sexual re-awakening. As long as old pals Nicholson and Keaton are on screen discussing their dilemma or discovering their mutual desire,Something's Gotta Giveis terrific, proving (in case anyone had forgotten) that Hollywood can and should aim for an older demographic. Myers falls short with the sitcom device of a younger lover (Keanu Reeves) who wants Keaton as much as Nicholson does; it's believable but shallow and too easily dismissed. Myers also skimps on supporting roles for Frances McDormand, Amanda Peet, and Jon Favreau, but thankfully this is one romantic comedy that doesn't pander to youth.

{"description": "Averyatypical mother-daughter relationship is at the center ofGilmore Girls, a comedy-drama that immediately set itself apart from the herd with smarter-than-smart dialogue and an endearing mix of whimsical comedy and family drama. Set in the Capra-esque burg of Stars Hollow, where everybody knows everyone and eccentrics abound,Gilmore Girlswas less a mother-daughter show and more of a screwball buddy comedy in which the two buddies happened to be parent and child. Pregnant at 16, Lorelai (Lauren Graham) left her rich parents to bring up her daughter Rory (Alexis Bledel) on her own terms; when Rory herself turns 16, Lorelai wants to send her academically gifted daughter to the prestigious Chilton school. The catch is, Lorelai can't afford it on her own, and rather than let Rory go without, the elder Gilmore girl brokers an uneasy truce with her parents (Edward Herrmann and Kelly Bishop), who finally get a chance to bond with their granddaughter while financing her education.It sounds like a premise potentially fraught with angst and trauma, but in realityGilmore Girlswas one of the freshest, airiest, most enjoyable shows to air on the perpetually melodramatic WB network, critically praised once viewers got hooked on its unique brand of humor. Rory's growing-up adventures, including her acclimation to snooty Chilton and romance with townie dreamboat Dean (Jared Padalecki), gave the show a teen-friendly feel, butGilmore Girlswas anchored in the adult by the luminous Graham, a brilliant comedic leading lady who could turn dramatic on a dime and never break stride. The show's hallmark was its rat-a-tat, whipsmart dialogue, delivered perfectly by Graham and Bledgel, as well as a host of wacky supporting characters who would go on to become invaluable cast members. The first season allowed the show--and its lead actresses--to bloom gracefully and establish a deep, humorous rapport that lent itself perfectly to weekly travails both comedic and dramatic.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002BJGYU8", "B002BJGYTY", "B002BJGYTO", "B002BJGYV2", "B000G1R4SY", "B000N6TYLW", "B00B1LKXV8", "B00008AOX3", "B0002I838Q", "B00006JIBS", "B0006Q93BA", "B000HWZ4IE", "B009MA9ZW8", "B00005JNEQ", "B0006FFRBG", "B0000E5NPY", "B004GJYRFA", "B0077PTWY6", "B00B5AAW52", "B003TY2SWC", "B004STBF2G", "B0009W5J4Q", "B001FB4VZ8", "B00A8KJN8M", "B000B5XOW0", "B00005JO9J", "B004STBF5S", "B00004RFCM", "B0002V7TZQ", "B0009K7QZ8", "B0009JE57G", "B000GYI32M", "B000XS3EFW", "B003SNJO5S", "B000YAA2SQ", "B004STBFPS", "B008FTX6MM", "B00005JLFT", "B00382S9UA", "0783235070", "B000R9YLKY", "B001ECDVK4", "B00006ZXSK", "B00AOCZOLO", "B000AYELVA", "B00684J49U", "B000NA2BEU", "B00AEBBAEK", "0061733512", "B009LDD4BO", "B005IA9JQ8", "B005IA9JQI", "B00AEFYM2S", "B009LDCXNY", "B005IA9JRM", "B00EIXWMII", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00008YGRU", "B002VWNIAY", "B002ZG988M", "1451666179", "B000NDEXK2", "B002JVWQSW", "B000W91RUG", "B004LWZW4M", "014242417X"], "bought_together": ["B002BJGYU8", "B002BJGYTY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B006WZIAHM", "B00B5AAW52", "B002BJGYTY", "B00B1LKXV8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9162}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.95, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001CCXZW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51oCGP2ik5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gilmore Girls: Season 1"}

{"description": "No actor works harder to open a movie than Tom Cruise. His enthusiasm is throughout the DVD extras as he mirrors his samurai character by constantly talking about \"loyalty\" and \"discipline\" while working on the film. However as a post-movie experience, the top-line extras with Cruise and director Edward Zwick are repetitive and underwhelming, with too many clips from the film we assume DVD viewers have just seen. The History Channel show is also a pre-release promotional device that misses an opportunity to really dig into this intriguing time period. Better are segments on the costumes, the production design, and how you put together an Imperial army--in New Zealand, no less. Zwick's low-key and dense commentary (plus a \"Video Journal\") is not vital, but he illustrates many of the little peculiarities it took to make the wide-ranging film come together. There are two deleted scenes; a samurai's first appearance is particularly memorable.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFY5B6", "B002O3Z50Q", "B00004XPPG", "B00AMSLDTM", "B0002YLCG0", "B0000DZTIW", "B000AARKOO", "B000QXDED6", "B003U0AHBO", "B00AEFXKUI", "B000A2WP7O", "B008MIMWOY", "B00AEBBA36", "B004AOECXI", "6305692688", "B000MGB6NM", "B0000TANUI", "079283366X", "B00005JL78", "B000W1SZBS", "B004SIP88Y", "B0034G4P58", "B001TUZG4K", "B00AS1Q93S", "B000MRA592", "B00001ZWUS", "B000E5N6LG", "B000XR9L50", "B0001HLVS2", "B00HEPDGKA", "B003ASLJO0", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000P0J0EW", "B0000A2ZNX", "B00005JNTI", "B0018QPPXW", "B000065U1N", "B000095WW8", "B0002WZTOI", "B002VWNIEA", "B004U7MQWY", "B002VWNID6", "B008JFUO36", "B00AEBB86A", "B00005JN0W", "B0007Q6VXC", "B001LRJH0U", "B000MZHW40", "B0002IQMAM", "B00004WG2F", "B003INBO3I", "B000EHRVMY", "B000NOKFHQ", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEFXVCU", "B000YENUI6", "B000M341QE", "B0000YEEGM", "B001680M26", "B008R65XYC", "B002ZG99QS", "B00008K76U", "B000HRMAPE", "B007TBKAXK", "B00000G3PA", "0767810856", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00AEFXYJA", "B002T9H2LA", "B000P0J0AG", "B00003CXZ1", "B000O599YO", "B000FS9FCG", "6304711905", "B00AEFXRRO", "B000HRMAUY", "B001ILHY1I", "B002NZK5V4", "B002VWNICC", "B000VKL6ZM", "B001UDS4BS", "B002ZG997C", "B004SIP8ZM", "0800177967", "B0001O3YD0", "B00005ATZT", "B004XFZ3UU", "B00004Z4WR", "B005LAIH2W", "B0007TKNGA", "B00000JQB5", "B0012Q732O", "B002ZG97RE", "B0002VEUV2", "0800141741", "B002ZG977Y", "B00005N5S3", "B00008G8M4", "B0000B1OFL"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFY5B6", "B00004XPPG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000QXDED6", "B00BEJL6JK", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00JU949TK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 121880}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 17.25, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001JXOUS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EdSWs9r9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Last Samurai (Full Screen Edition)"}

{"description": "With this third season,Frasierscored an impressive hat trick, winning its third successive Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series. You don't need too much analysis to get to the bottom of this unprecedented success. The series was a primetime oasis of wit and sophistication, with welcome forays into farce that pricked Frasier's bubble of pomposity. His priceless reactions to the assaults on his dignity are worthy of Jack Benny. Frasier (Kelsey Grammer) can be infuriating, as in \"The Focus Group,\" in which he is obsessed with knowing why a lone focus group participant (guest star Tony Shalhoub) doesn't like him. But he is also endearing in his delusional view of himself as, in the words of one mocking bystander, a \"man of the people.\" Frasier meets his match in new station owner Kate Costas (Oscar-winner Mercedes Ruehl). Their combative relationship turns to lust over the course of the first 10 episodes.But the season's most pivotal story arc is the separation of  Niles (David Hyde Pierce) and Maris. \"Moon Dance,\" which marked Grammer's directorial debut, is a series benchmark, as a crestfallen Niles tangos with his unrequited love, Daphne (Jane Leeves), at a high society ball. Not that the Crane family still doesn't have issues to work out. Frasier cannot abide being beaten at chess by Martin (John Mahoney) in \"Chess Pains.\" Frasier and Niles ill-advisedly go into joint practice in \"Shrink Rap,\" and find themselves on the opposite sides of a sanity hearing in \"Crane vs. Crane.\" Lilith is sorely missed, but in this season's blast-from-the-past episode, Shelley Long returns in \"The Show Where Diane Comes Back.\" It is a joy to seeCheersresurrected, if only in Diane's self-absorbed new play, which Frasier agrees to back. And any episode with Frasier's amoral agent Bebe (Harriet Sansom Harris) is must-see television.Frasier's humor was character-based, rather than topical, giving it a longer shelf life. For those who lament the end of one of television's gold standard series, this boxed set will be excellent therapy.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006Q93AQ", "B0007Y08RY", "B000A0GOQY", "B000B5XOUC", "B000ERVJMW", "B000MX7V5W", "B0002WZTLQ", "B000VDDE0Y", "B006OKOWUY", "B0001NBNIY", "B0006IUDYY", "B0000E32X2", "B00008NV4G", "B000A0GOQ4", "B0007Y08JW", "B001HUHBAY", "B0012EM5EC", "B0019F02W6", "B000ERVJMM", "B000YKYT1M", "B000B5XOTS", "B000BNTM46", "B0007R4SWC", "B0002UE1WQ", "B0007YXRCW", "B00GHH9HW2", "B000AJJNJK", "B00HNGC56G", "B008LCRAFC", "B004D2GMVM", "B0002W4SWW", "B000A7PKGW", "B0051T47ZE", "B000C1VBAA", "B0007US79Y", "B00070HK4C", "B000GRUMQY", "B0000CGNEC", "B000B8I9ZY", "B0006Q93BU", "B008LCRAC0", "B0002W4SX6", "B00005JLEX", "B0009UC7MK", "B008LCRA7K", "B0019D151K", "B0007KTBJO", "B008LCRABQ", "B0007Y08P6", "B0012EM5EW", "B0001907BW", "B008LCRA98", "B008L0YMZA", "B001QE99AQ", "B001BN4WI6", "B000VDDE18", "B0002I84FS", "B000AJJNIQ", "B0001Z3I1C", "B000I2J6VE", "B000Z27H8Q", "B000EBGFQI", "B006MFQ4DE", "B00I458456", "B007C8RZYC", "B00005JLIC", "B000G6BL7O", "B000291Q3O", "B000NTMA1U", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B000HT3P60", "B00008979F", "B0089BSNQA", "B000QUEQ6I", "B000068V9X", "B000A9QKSM", "B009LDD1X0", "B0058JEI06", "B0002NY8PI", "B0001ZMWXW", "B0002NY8R6", "B004ES6TBS", "B001FSKE84", "B00BCMT3TO", "B00EYA6VF0", "B000FVQLIO", "B00BTFK01Y", "B00B04NII6", "B0007UDCX0", "B0009WFEEG", "0671003682", "B001FB4VXU", "B002TQKL16", "B005IA9JRM", "B00BUWD7E8", "B000W91RUG", "B00009Y3RW", "B001993YB8"], "bought_together": ["B0006Q93AQ", "B0007Y08RY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0006Q93AQ", "B000VDDE18", "B0007Y08RY", "B000B5XOUC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7631}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 15.47, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B0001NBNJ8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515wj4cZLtL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Frasier: Season 3"}
{"description": "The turbulent lives of two handsome and high-priced Miami plastic surgeons may be one of the more unusual premises for a television series, but the FX Channel'sNip/Tuckcombines sudsy sex and biting wit with the emotional quandaries involved in body modification in a way that makes for an engrossing--and occasionally gross--hourlong drama. The show benefits greatly from its two leads--Dylan Walsh as the troubled \"good\" surgeon and Julian McMahon as his predatory (but equally troubled) \"bad\" partner--as well as Joely Richardson as Walsh's wife and Roma Maffia as the surgeons' nurse. IfNip/Tuckdoes have a stumbling point, it's in its occasionally glib dialogue (series creator Ryan Murphy was a writer for the verbally flashy high school seriesPopular), which can clash with an episode's more dramatic and poignant moments. The show also doesn't shy away from showing the more gruesome aspects of plastic surgery, but viewers can often see more stomach-churning images on the top-ratedCSI. But the strength of the performances and the originality of the premise make these rough spots manageable for viewers looking for an interesting spin on the usual \"doctor show.\" The five-DVD set offers an extended version of the pilot and all 12 episodes of the first season as well as a trio of documentaries (one on the show itself, another on its special effects, and a third, \"Realistic Expectations,\" on real-life plastic surgeons). A gag reel (amusingly titled \"Severed Parts\"), a selection of deleted scenes for most episodes, and a music video for the title theme (\"A Perfect Lie\" by the Engine Room) round out the box.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009IW88K", "B000FUTVLO", "B000QUTTPG", "B0013FSL16", "B003CN5SAY", "B001PQZYQI", "B000QUTTPQ", "1419811118", "B00079FUI6", "B0008JIJ1A", "B001QE99AQ", "B000ENUYGI", "B000OIOOVE", "B000Q6GUKW", "B00166647K", "B00HT851LO", "B000FFJYE8", "B00005JO9J", "B000FIMG4U", "B000FVQLIO", "B000FIMG5Y", "B00008AOX3", "B000QUTTQ0", "B00005JNOG", "B000FIMG68", "B00JF5GAZA", "B002WQ799U", "B000QDLSR0", "B0018CWEZI", "B000P6YNTI", "B0012CJQY6", "B00166UFSY", "B0024FAR5M", "B0036TGTF2", "B000P6YNSE", "B0012CJQYG", "B000FKO3GW", "B00005JPII", "B001AQBGM4", "B000P6YNSO", "B001FB4W0W", "B0007QS324", "B000V86OKG", "B001B7CNZ6", "B002N5N5QQ", "B000YABIQ6", "B000FUTVPA", "B0002RQ3MK", "B000NDEXK2", "B000Q6GUW0", "B001B7N4WM", "B002WQ79A4", "B0018CWEYY", "B000YW8RPE", "B003L77GRO", "B0015ABRE2", "B000R9YLKY", "B00005JNEQ", "B001VPJYZK", "B0012CJQZA", "B0002V7TZQ", "B0012CJQZ0", "B003F3NDP8", "B001LM64UG", "B0002MPQRS", "B0012CJQYQ", "B0018CWEYO", "B0000E5NPY", "B000R7HRRA", "B0011NVCAM", "B0002234R2", "B001ILFUAA", "B003CPPY5G", "B000P12LWY", "B00004RFCM", "B001MVWRNE", "B00IYMSMTM", "B000RW3VDE", "B002GHHHL0", "B002AMVED8", "B000E3L7F0", "B00168ML34", "B0055SNHQG", "B000FS9MY2", "B0013ZGN9I", "B00009Y3RW", "B005FISBTO", "B0006IUE16", "B000HT3P6U", "B0009K7QZ8", "B000G1R4TS", "B000JLTRJK", "B008H6GHF6", "B000B8IA08", "B00005JMMT", "B003LXM1PK", "B001CY5N1E", "B002N5N5M0", "B000MGBSI0", "B000G6BL88"], "bought_together": ["B0009IW88K", "B000FUTVLO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000QUTTPG", "B001PQZYQI", "B0013FSL16", "B003XWEQ8E"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 11266}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 12.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001O3YLM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2B5PfPHCXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Nip/Tuck: Season 1"}

{"description": "The two main extras ofCody Banks 2: Destination Londonare targeted toward kids.  Rather than a full-length audio-only commentary track, Frankie Muniz, Anthony Anderson, and Hannah Spearritt appear in a \"visual cast commentary,\" in which they pause the movie and come on-screen to discuss it.  Their comments are brief and intended for younger viewers (\"One of the greatest things about making a movie is how they edit it\" or \"Those Segways are the coolest things ever invented.\").  You have to watch the film again to participate in the interactive quiz--and again, the actors stop the action and offer multiple-choice questions about details that just appeared, such as what a character was wearing.  It's refreshing that both features don't assume that kids will refuse to watch a movie with black bars on the screen: they're available on the widescreen version, not the pan-and-scan version.  Also included are a brief making-of featurette, three deleted scenes, and three extended scenes.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00009QG6G", "B000069HZN", "B00005JN0D", "B001JJMGIU", "B00005JKZM", "B0000639HQ", "B005FLSZQU", "B000BJ7BCK", "B004SIPAFK", "B000LMPDXQ", "B00005JM9Q", "B00005JMZA", "B004SIPAEG", "B004SIPADM", "B000JBWWPG", "B004SIPA9Q", "B002935GMS", "6306010513", "B000N4RARO", "B0009DWL8W", "B002ZG99M2", "B00005JMCW", "B000BFH2C8", "B0006J28MI", "B000ZBEOEC", "B000AM4P9A", "B00063KGPU", "B004U7MQVK", "B0019ESNGO", "B00005JPO4", "B00005JM4W", "B0000A02WB", "B000031EGV", "B00AEFY8FO", "B0007LXPBI", "B0007US7C6", "B000803BQC", "B000GB775E", "B000640WHG", "B0007Z0NYG", "B000GB5MH4", "B00005JN0Z", "B000324Y98", "B0002RQ0XC", "B0002S64TQ", "B00BIYQPJC", "B001NPD9JA", "B00019PE0Q", "B002WNU0QM", "B000FKP3XY", "B00006G8K2", "B001NP8WYC", "B0013ND3MK", "B001LMAK9W", "B00919TING", "B003Y5H52O", "B007I8KXDQ", "B000DBHX4M", "B005F3XV62", "B0007LXPBS", "B000P0J088", "1558908404", "B000HDRB8O", "B0016Q2D5M", "B00008WJD6", "B00006RCL2", "B000065V42", "B003PGNBNY", "B001SXZ7T2", "B0006SSMWE", "B002WNU0OY", "B00005JM55", "B000RBA6C4", "B0009JE57G", "B007R6DJP8", "B001AVCFGK", "B000OYCM5I", "B00018WL4E", "B002DOBGWM", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B00FMGPVCO", "B000EXDS48", "B00005JLRQ", "B001725ZD2", "B001GC9VK6", "B002OMIKHC", "B000051S54", "B00062IVN0", "B000089771", "B00175VSBW", "B00AEBB8KQ", "B001ER4CPM", "B0007Z9R66", "B000YGGNMO", "B00ECGIL9K", "B007EQR0D8", "B004SIP75S", "B001NP8WY2", "B00284G2A8", "B000QXDG4S"], "bought_together": ["B00009QG6G", "B000069HZN"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00009QG6G", "B005FLSZQU", "B000BJ7BCK", "B000069HZN"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 24086}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.79, "brand": "MGM (Video &amp; Dvd)", "asin": "B00022FWTA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51M6YYHMTHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London (Special Edition)"}

{"description": "After one episode ofThe Wireyou'll be hooked. After three, you'll be astonished by the precision of its storytelling. After viewing all 13 episodes of the HBO series' remarkable first season, you'll be cheering a bona-fide American masterpiece. Series creator David Simon was a veteran crime reporter fromThe Baltimore Sunwho cowrote thebookthat inspired TV'sHomicide, and cowriter Ed Burns was a Baltimore cop, lending impeccable street-cred to an inner-city Baltimore saga (and companion piece toThe Corner) that Simon aptly describes as \"a visual novel\" and \"a treatise on institutions and individuals\" as opposed to a conventional good-vs.-evil police procedural. Owing a creative debt to the novels of Richard Price (especiallyClockers), the series opens as maverick Detective Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West, in a star-making role) is tapping into a vast network of drugs and death around southwest Baltimore's deteriorating housing projects. With a mandate to get results ASAP, a haphazard team is assembled to join McNulty's increasingly complex investigation, built upon countless hours of electronic surveillance.The show's split-perspective plotting is so richly layered, so breathtakingly authentic and based on finely drawn characters brought to life by a perfect ensemble cast, that it defies concise description. Simon, Burns, and their cowriters control every intricate aspect of the unfolding epic; directors are top-drawer (including Clark Johnson, helmer ofThe Shield's finest episodes), but they are servants to the story, resulting in a TV series like no other: unpredictable, complicated, and demanding the viewer's rapt attention,The Wireis \"an angry show\" (in Simon's words) that refuses to comfort with easy answers to deep-rooted societal problems. Moral gray zones proliferate in a universe where ruthless killers have a logical code, and where the cops are just as ambiguous as their targets. That ambiguity extends to the ending as well; season 1 leaves several issues unresolved, leaving you begging for the even more impressive developments that await in season 2.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006IUD9Y", "B000FTCLSU", "B000QXDJLI", "B00123BY6S", "B004YOEDR4", "B00316DDYA", "B00005Y6YJ", "B00003CXOP", "B003Y5HWJU", "B001DJLCRC", "B005SEDI5M", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B00J5LXT44", "B0000Y40PW", "B00HUCF420", "B00000FBH2", "B0060MYKYY", "B0012CJQY6", "B00EEDNR9A", "B002AMUDK8", "B001RTSPVY", "0802144993", "B00HW3EXCE", "B0058YPG1G", "B00BVMXBDO", "B00031TYBC", "B00KHWSD1O", "B00FCOTRV2", "B001DW2BFQ", "B0032UYFA6", "B00HGE90Z4", "B000G1R4TS", "B00ECGHM5O", "B0055CP9UY", "B0012CJQYG", "B000NA1VI2", "B0038M2APA", "B0012CJQYQ", "B009LDCZ7I", "B0009GV9E6", "B0060MYM3S", "B0009K7RMA", "B00FEP9MYG", "B0015TX2LO", "B0011VJRVU", "B00ECHBSP8", "B0047H7QD6", "B00B5J6A7W", "B0020TS5EM", "B009VXVMAO", "B004YM6JVO", "B00C8CQRQ4", "B00HUCF7AO", "B001IBIDLI", "B000BO7DWI", "B000KLQUUS", "B004TJ1GY2", "B00FGEO9NE", "B00DJYJRHG", "B0019LY5IM", "B008CLI4N4", "B00I9MS86O", "B00C888LOO", "B00007KLE8", "B0094UOI64", "B004X1VUNI", "B001AQO3WY", "B00DNR3FN6", "B0038M2AQ4", "B002BLNGTS", "B004132HZS", "B00BNH9NCU", "B00BGI076M", "B00BUUAV08", "B00HOGBXS6", "B004HW7JO2", "B00BTRKMNI", "B00BC5FN2C", "B00000I73E", "B000FP2OPY", "B002CPMB9O", "B00CWIMVDW", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B000YABIQ6", "B005DVIOIG", "B00EIXWW2O", "B00HUCF6KK", "B0007YMVWO", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00DW5IKN4", "B00AB55BS0", "B000P0J09M", "B001IBIHQ4", "B00AEFYG3S", "B001GCUER0", "B003EYVXTG", "B00005JNOG", "B000MGBSE4", "B00H7LJ2UO", "B00CDTSFF8"], "bought_together": ["B0006IUD9Y", "B000FTCLSU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005NFJAWG", "B0006IUD9Y", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B001DJLCRC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3788}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 22.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0002ERXC2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511fyhhxpWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Wire: Season 1"}

{"description": "The first and only spin-off ofBabylon 5, J. Michael Straczynski's short-lived sci-fi seriesCrusadehad its roots in theB5television movieA Call to Arms, in which Earth was battling a Drakh invasion at the end of the Shadow Wars. WhenCrusadebegins, the Drakh have released a deadly virus that threatens to wipe out all 10 billion humans living on Earth unless a cure can be found in five years. To take on this monumental task, Captain Matthew Gideon (Gary Cole) is assigned command of the state-of-the-art Destroyer-class shipExcalibur. His crew includes telepath John Matheson (Daniel Dae Kim); pompous but brilliant archaeologist-linguist Max Eilerson (David Allen Brooks); Dureena, a member of the Thieves' Guild and the last surviving member of her species (Carrie Dobro); medical officer Sarah Chambers (Marjean Holden); and technomage Galen (Peter Woodward).WhileBabylon 5had five years to develop into a powerful saga,Crusadehad its plug pulled after a mere 13 episodes (which were reordered for TNT's broadcast), and the series never really got its footing. Galen often took center stage, then disappeared for several episodes. Matheson was underutilized (other than to provide fans with clues about what happened in the Psi-Wars afterB5ended), and tough-guy Gideon bounced back and forth between his desire to save the human race and his own moral code. There were some good action scenes and intriguing concepts (developed in conjunction with the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory). Special effects sometimes were impressive and sometimes showed budget constraints, and we never really saw the power and scope of the mile-and-a-half-long ship, other than the cool bullet cars used to traverse its length. But it did have its moments. IfB5was the spiritual companion toStar Trek: Deep Space Ninewith its space-station setting and long story arc,Crusadewas more like a traditionalStar Treksetting, with mostly stand-alone episodes involving first contact with various species (even if, due to the nature of theExcalibur's quest, such species were usually extinct). And there were occasional tantalizing hints of a broader conspiracy that might have allowed the series to soar. Regardless,B5fans will welcome even a brief opportunity to revisit this universe, especially when theExcaliburvisits the station in \"The Rules of the Game.\" John Sheridan's ex-wife Captain Elizabeth Lochley (Tracy Scoggins) even earned a spot in the opening credits for her appearance in a few episodes.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004EXWGHY", "B000CEXFYW", "B000PHX8RA", "B002DUJ9Q6", "B002BAW6GS", "B002BAW6H2", "B002BAW6FY", "B002BAW6GI", "B002BAW6FE", "B000JLTRHW", "B000ELL1QC", "B000BCCAEQ", "B00F3L8P26", "B0009JE6G6", "B00005NTNP", "B00404ME2E", "B003H9LIU2", "B0009JE6FM", "B006LPHY6G", "B006P2TA44", "B000FIHN8O", "B001RHGRTS", "B000FJH5M2", "B0006FO9B0", "B001DF681G", "B00KC57IWG", "B000E5N6B6", "B007AFC0W4", "B000FOPPBA", "B004HYW84G", "B001DW2BG0", "B003Y7JWZ0", "B004TJ1H3C", "B0051GOB2G", "B0048FUUAI", "B003ZFC9M4", "B003H9LIRK", "B008R52LA2", "B0042YZFYG", "B0041B77RS", "B00IWTVDUW", "B00402FGE4", "B000BOH8Y6", "B000BR9SA0", "B00BN0WQ5I", "B00GX7D5G0", "B0000V4910", "B00A3718IS", "B000HCO8KE", "B002ZCY872", "B0015LPS1Y", "B002USF1UO", "B00E688AZE", "B00466H3A4", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B003BV8I7C", "B000W4KT9G", "B002GP7ZWI", "B004LROMWU", "B00K2CHWYI", "B00465I156", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00HUPC5X8", "B003PGNBO8", "B00170LCWC", "B0057FGD3Q", "B000WLU5ZM", "B00062RCC6", "B001RTCP1U", "B00L4K3MLE", "B00023BKMC", "B004LROMS4", "B002CLKP00", "B0000AQS0F", "B00KO7NUWO", "B000WTZ6SK", "B00E0KY62O", "B003R0MEYA", "B0007CEXUY", "B00HXEWECI", "B00E688720", "B00E3QJ7JC", "B00K2CHVSK", "B000V5IP6K", "B00ECXJC28", "B002VA5A02", "0345427173", "B00A3717C0", "B002U0KHME", "B00J82PU92", "0739414852", "B00KM5F31O", "B000FJH5MC", "B001RXDM2M", "B001EN71CW", "B002HRF7AW", "B0041OOSMC", "B007XF0XVQ", "B008XJM6H0", "B00HWWUQYY"], "bought_together": ["B004EXWGHY", "B002DUJ9Q6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004EXWGHY", "B002BAW6H2", "B002DUJ9Q6", "B00F3L8P26"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6775}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 15.69, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B00061QJSK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ATW37CMGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Crusade: The Complete Series"}
{"description": "Despite a limited TV budget and a tight 20-day shooting schedule, ESPN's3pays honorable tribute to NASCAR's greatest hero. Barry Pepper (the ace marksman inSaving Private Ryan) is perfectly cast as Dale Earnhardt, who rose from humble beginnings as a cotton-mill worker to legendary status as \"the Intimidator,\" whose aggressive racing style was frequently controversial. While basing its drama on Earnhardt's relationship with his stern father Ralph (himself a fearless dirt-track champion), Robert Eisele's teleplay struggles with trackside clich&#xE9;s while functioning as both intimate portrait and highlight reel of pivotal races from Earnhardt's career. As directed by Russell Mulcahy (Highlander), the film succeeds as a blue-collar drama about a man driven by destiny--and ominous fate--who embodied the best (and sometimes the worst) of NASCAR culture, popularizing the sport like no driver before or since. All of the essential bases are covered, and the superb supporting cast includes Elizabeth Mitchell as Earnhardt's third wife, Teresa, J.K. Simmons (J. Jonah Jameson from theSpider-Manfilms) as Ralph Earnhardt, and newcomer Marshall McGee as Dale Earnhardt Jr. Titled after Earnhardt's black #3 Goodwrench Chevy,3is a conventional TV biopic, but it's essential viewing for those who loved--or even hated--the man who died too young, at age 49, on the final lap at Daytona in 2001.Bonus features in this two-disc set are abundant and excellent, including an in-depth \"making of\" featurette, a definitive ESPN documentary on Earnhardt's life and career (featuring a virtual who's-who of NASCAR superstars), a generous archive of Earnhardt interviews, and extensive highlights from four historic races, including Earnhardt's controversial contact with Terry Labonte to win the 1999 Bush 500 at Bristol, and the Earnhardts' (Sr. and Jr.) 1st- and 2nd-place wins at IROC round 3 that same year. All in all, this is DVD heaven for NASCAR fans.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000ZZUVRM", "B001LM64V0", "B00AEFXR1K", "B002NUULQ8", "B0001AP16M", "B0037XXSM4", "B000IB0DDK", "B007XF0WXA", "B00126808U", "B00IXO6VNA", "B00003CXTM", "B001DJ69BQ", "B000HT38CQ", "B002LMOB4Q", "B0007P0XDM", "B000FVR1T2", "B0032Z6YTQ", "B000ALDYTI", "B0053U7D9I", "B0011367UW", "B003SLEDHO", "B00G3ESW98", "B000ZBEOH4", "B0075II4P8", "B00005M20J", "B000BZISWQ", "0760338140", "B00I3HFAIE", "B00FQFFQ2Q", "B000G1R3ZI", "B0006Q941Y", "B00002SSKG", "B00004Z4WR", "1401344437", "B0048C8VKM", "B000UNYJP4", "B000E4IED2", "B000VKL6XY", "B0028ERCAC", "B00FQFFPZO", "B0037XPFWK", "B000P6R9K8", "B00G6MW612", "B00G6MW5CC", "B000162ZNI", "B000LA6D0K", "B007XF0X52", "B0039FRDCQ", "B0052SO0LK", "B00I3HFB7E", "B000JEUYVW", "B0040LMA9E", "B0002O7XW2", "157243435X", "B0006L0L5C", "B00151QYCG", "B0004Z35PI", "B00BZD4CUK", "B00BEIYP1W", "B000065V3G", "B0012OX7D0", "B000E8QVWY", "B004NJC0J8", "B000R7HY46", "B000J4P9P8", "B0045L47L8", "B000OHZJIM", "B002O3Z50G", "B00062IDO2", "B0077T5SV8", "6305989435", "B00AEBB9UU", "B0000ZMFDA", "B002XY4WXW", "B002NZK5Q4", "B001LRK8B2", "B001DXS48S", "B004XYABQ2", "B000F8DBDK", "B0028ERCB6", "B0002WZTOI", "B000O77SNG", "B00006AUHQ", "1600780903", "B000AYELI8", "B00003CXPS", "B0010YSD8Q", "B00009AOAX", "B00AMQGB6O", "B00029RTAI", "B001LGXIA6", "B00009AOAW", "B0000VD11E", "B009C30TLG", "B0000ALPFG", "B00AEFY4CG", "B002NZK5QO", "B00003CXTG", "B000GQ5V2K", "B002LU3BZI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000ZZUVRM", "B001LM64V0", "B00AEFXR1K", "B0037XXSM4"]}, "price": 14.36, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 57498}, "asin": "B000642008", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RJDA22D6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "3: DALE EARNHARDT STORY"}
{"description": "Going Upriver: The Long War of John Kerrybegins by juxtaposing  beautiful images of Vietnam with horrific images of the Vietnam War. But  though its depiction of the war is vivid--and the accounts of 2004  presidential candidate John Kerry's heroism, told by the men who served  with him, are plain and free of hyperbole--it's his actions after he came  back to the U.S. that stand out in this documentary. Kerry's involvement  with Vietnam Veterans Against the War, for whom he became an inadvertent  but eloquent spokesperson, required as much courage as facing the Viet  Cong.Going Uprivergives a clear sense of the emotional and social  pressures of the anti-war protests, where speaking one's mind became as  powerful as firing a gun.Going Upriver's emphasis on post-war  activity makes it an excellent complement to the documentaryBrothers  in Arms, which focuses on Kerry's swift-boat experiences in Vietnam.  ThoughGoing Upriversuffers from some soundbites that seem too  tailor-made for Kerry's presidential campaign, it doesn't make other  veterans feel like political props, asBrothers in Armsstarted to  do towards the end.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002W2JP0", "0060565292"], "bought_together": ["B0002W2JP0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 300021}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.97, "brand": "", "asin": "B000646MMA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DVKHS4FPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Going Upriver - The Long War of John Kerry"}
{"description": "Novelist Anthony Trollope doesn't have the name recognition of his  Victorian contemporary Charles Dickens, but he has all of Dickens's  strengths and more--invigorating plots, eccentric characters bursting  with life, and an insightful, panoramic view of English society.He  Knew He Was Rightstarts with an idyllic romance between the well-off  Louis Trevelyan (Oliver Dimsdale) and Emily Rowley (Laura Fraser). But  when the rakish Col. Osborne (Bill Nighy,Love Actually) begins to  visit her regularly, Louis becomes jealous--and the pressures of Victorian  society soon turn this jealousy into an all-consuming possession that  could destroy the lives of Louis, Emily, and their young son. This dark  and harrowing story is deftly juxtaposed with two related tales: A  blithely flirtatious clergyman finds himself fought over by a pair of  squabbling sisters and a young woman struggles to find happiness despite  the controlling grip of her miserly spinster aunt (the always superb Anna  Massey,Angels & Insects,The Importance of Being Earnest).The cast delivers wonderfully comic or heartbreaking performances, but  much of this four-episode series' power comes from yet another outstanding  adaptation by screenwriter Andrew Davies, who wrote the scripts for such  BBC miniseries asMoll Flanders,Vanity Fair, and the  hugely popular version ofPride and Prejudicewith Colin Firth. The  combination of Davies and Trollope results in a work of psychological  depth, sly humor, and sheer storytelling mastery--just when you've decided  someone is virtuous or odious, that character upends your judgment with an  act unexpected yet completely plausible.He Knew He Was Rightprovides the pleasures of a thriller, a social satire, and a whirling  romance.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005YUNK", "B000M2E32M", "B000GIXLUC", "B00065GX96", "B000EBD9VC", "B00005JOA0", "B000784WNQ", "B000E0ODZE", "B0000AQS3P", "B0009PVZM8", "B000A8AXXG", "B00062IZ0Y", "B000089QEM", "B004JMSIQS", "B005T0OY5S", "B002XTBECY", "B000AYEL6U", "B0009PVZL4", "B0013NAMLK", "B001P807RC", "B000Z27HLS", "B003CP1T50", "B007A2O3FO", "B001PU8N0I", "B000M2E32C", "B009L2EW5W", "B000G6BM0K", "B0046ZYEUW", "B0080QOL10", "B0077PBPVE", "0767812115", "B000PFUA7S", "B003WEAW18", "B004JMSIVI", "B00DW5ILF6", "B00141188M", "B0031RAP5Y", "B000E8JNQU", "B0002S648C", "B002XTBEDI", "B009T6CXG0", "B00J379KKW", "B004XVMCMQ", "B0077PBPJ6", "B004FM2EL2", "B008UQUS26", "B000FQIRXQ", "B0031RAP5O", "B00005OBAL", "B007701RFS", "B00140PK6O", "B00F1BFRA6", "B004D45NYC", "B00HUAGZ34", "B0012OVCE6", "B000FQIRY0", "B002XTBE6K", "B0074FUSFG", "B00AF82WTO", "B004XYOQU4", "B00006HAZH", "B00007149J", "B00003JRCQ", "B001B4VXWS", "B002VWOMZ4", "B000Z27HMW", "B00HUAH14Q", "B000E0ODZO", "B0009PVZIW", "B000BITVAG", "B000FL7CBY", "B000I2J6WI", "B0019MFY2C", "B000V02CO6", "B00D49YEHO", "B0054DPLUC", "B0083HXKMC", "B00EF0NVGQ", "B000HEWGWE", "B003TY2STA", "B0007LFPJ8", "B00009MEJ4", "B002EWD0I6", "B001PU8O5W", "B007ISJS1O", "B00G6HO368", "B00005O7N8", "B0077PBPGO", "B001GJ4U5A", "B004K4FUUC", "B0080QOL1A", "B00HGE90Z4", "B004499LWG", "B0013K2ZGI", "B00003CXSA", "B001JXPC7S", "B00505ETV6", "B000EMGF2Q", "0767020308", "B005JZBPAK"], "bought_together": ["B00005YUNK", "B000M2E32M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000M2E32M", "B000BNTMKK", "B00005JOA0", "B000EBD9VC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 64433}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 13.89, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00065GVIO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51wvEfQ0qqL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "He Knew He Was Right"}

{"description": "Jean-Luc Godard once famously wrote, \"The cinema is Nicholas Ray.\" Much less famous is the movie that occasioned the observation.Bitter Victorymarked Ray's ascension to \"auteur\" demigod status in France. Unfortunately, American prints ran 20 minutes shorter than theAm&#xE8;re victoireseen in Europe, with the unsurprising result that this enigmatic film--so charged with suppressed desperation and rage, you can hear the neurons snapping--became well-nigh incoherent. It gets worse. The picture, a milestone in the deployment of CinemaScope for emotional subtlety and expressiveness, was dumped to television in a pan-&-scan version that made hash of its compositions and editing rhythm. And that's the only way it was seen, for decades.The setting is North Africa early in World War II. Two British officers, played by Curd J&#xFC;rgens and Richard Burton, lead a commando team into the desert to attack a German post. Commander J&#xFC;rgens doesn't know, but comes to suspect, that his wife (Ruth Roman) and Burton were involved sometime before J&#xFC;rgens married her. The mission recedes into the background as the tension between the two men builds, and issues of ethics, cowardice, and the legitimacy of wartime killing are thrown into relief against the anvil of the desert. Jurgens was an opaque actor, but Burton etches a searingly modern portrait of an alienated soul whose mordant self-awareness avails him nothing; it's right up there with such Ray-directed landmark performances as James Dean's inRebel Without a Causeand Humphrey Bogart's inIn a Lonely Place.--Richard T.

However, underneath its seemingly normal struggle between discipline and the resistance of the adolescence lie the school's dark and dirty secrets, and a terrifying fury, which is unleashed with the death of Mr. Park, a teacher of room 3-3, whose nickname was an \"Old fox\". The fear for the unrest in the school forces teaches to impose a \"silent regime\" on students who had seen the dead body of the Old fox hanging in the school's overpass. As if it had been expected, painting the scene of death by a senior classmate Ji-oh arouses a lot of abuse from a room 3-3's new teacher called Mad dog. Amid the strange rumors that spread throughout the school, Jung-sook, who always used to be compared with the Mad dog's favorite student So-young, commits suicide, and the Mad dog himself disappears with no traces left. Meanwhile, a former senior student from room 3-3, Eun-young who a literature teacher appointed to his alma mater is molested by the words left over his telephone by the Old fox the night before he died. Eun-young finally suspects that the horrific events happened in the school, had something to do with the death of her best friend nine years ago...", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FZEQFK", "B000FZEQVY", "B000MEYKCI", "B000FS9FIA", "B000R7HY32", "B000GB5MOW", "B000LPS3B2", "B002U041OE", "B000088NQR", "B001P9N9AI", "B0009KA2UO", "B000E3LGMY", "B00260LDSU", "B0000AVHAO", "B0007XBM8O", "B000H5U5YO", "B000E0OE4O", "B000MM0LHS", "B000H0M4CK", "B000NA21RM", "B000NO243E"], "bought_together": ["B000FZEQFK", "B000FZEQVY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FZEQEQ", "B000FZEQVY", "B000FZEQFK", "B0009A40PC"]}, "price": 7.88, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 244827}, "asin": "B00070Q8LI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BH3GB3Q6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Whispering Corridors"}

Each disc offers \"Origins ofThe Outer Limits,\" a talking-heads interview with the show's creators, as well as featurettes on the making of the episodes compiled on each disc (theSex and Sci-FiandAliens Among Usdiscs offer slight variations on this format by offering a multi-part featurette and a documentary on a single episode, respectively).--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000B5IP4W", "B00GT4NCBU", "B001A7GOCA", "B0002J4ZX2", "B0007CEXUY", "B0002CX1M0", "B0016MOWNM", "B003VJTGNE", "B001DXS4DI", "B00092ZLDK", "B006TBYC76", "B000068V9T", "B003BNO9GO", "B004E5BQDW", "B00068NVLQ", "B000QTCY7M", "B00IS6WQ2S", "B000068V9S", "B0045Z2W0C", "B0051GOB2G", "B00005JN8Q", "B000TJBNF8", "B001BGS17Q", "B003OW6JAG", "B00026L7OU", "B00I9BU2IC", "B00005JOJE", "B000FJH5M2", "B00DOZNI8Y", "B0007XG158", "B001CY5N00", "B004ZJ9VXY", "B001RHGRTS", "B000FOPPBA", "B000OPOAKW", "B00022FWEU", "B000HCO86I", "B000SULWKO", "B000H5U5EE", "B00GX7D5G0", "B00D9EJFZA", "B001CT05SA", "B00013D54Y", "B0007US7CQ", "B000ELL1QC", "B000GYI340", "B006MFQ4OS", "B005AMJ3B0", "B003Y8YAZQ", "B008DVJOQ4", "B002USF1UO", "B001FACH7S", "B00021R7CG", "B00AEFYXQI", "B009OE2NZI", "B006BZ8NSE", "B005GYXN2M", "B00E5G03I4", "B00A92MFQG", "B006P2TA44", "B003NKU9XM", "B002TVQ4GW", "B0085Z3BYE", "B00BTYPW7C", "B00F3L8P26", "B0007X7044", "B008G4T7W4", "B00E8G5H8W", "B00DOZNGTK", "B000BOH8Y6", "B0003JAOO0", "B000BCCAEQ", "B00ECHBSP8", "B0000VD12I", "B005CFC04W", "0345490207", "B0030E5PYO", "B00BCMT3TO", "B008XB2UCE", "B0024FAG7Q", "B000EOTV98", "B005CFC0N8", "B001DSNEME", "B0024FADD8", "B00466H3A4", "B001B8XRT6", "B0009JE6FM", "B000JLTRHW", "B000062XFG", "B0011FLGZQ", "B00C7A8WZQ", "6305869367", "B0030VANJO", "B003NOGNQU", "B000G1R39E", "B000E5N6B6", "B0024FAR66", "B000T9OP7G", "B00008438U"], "bought_together": ["B000B5IP4W", "B0007CEXUY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000B5IP4W", "B00GT4NCBU", "B004E5BQDW", "B003BNO9GO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 79835}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 34.99, "brand": "Unknown", "asin": "B0007XG2YS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y667JVCBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Outer Limits - The New Series (Aliens Among Us/Death &amp; Beyond/Fantastic Androids &amp; Robots/Mutation and Transformation/Sex &amp; Science Fiction/Time Travel &amp; Infinity Collections)"}

{"description": "Miss Marple is back, and what an invigorating, happy experience this quartet of British television productions is for both mystery fans and casual viewers. The luminous Geraldine McEwan (Vanity Fair), following in the footsteps of Helen Hayes, Angela Lansbury, Margaret Rutherford, and others, essays Agatha Christie's aging, amateur sleuth as a discreet observer, knowing friend, and judicious dispenser of wisdom during murder investigations. But what really makes these crisp adaptations a delight is the endless parade of familiar actors playing those numerous suspects, baffled police, and innocent observers who routinely populate Christie's glossy, whodunit landscapes. It's hard not to be dazzled by supporting casts that include Tara Fitzgerald, Robert Powell, Simon Callow, Joanna Lumley, Ian Richardson, Jane Asher, Miriam Margolyes, Tim McInnerny, Herbert Lom, and Jenny Agutter, all nestled into gorgeous, post-World War II backdrops, usually in the English countryside.This boxed set includes \"The Murder at the Vicarage,\" based on Christie's 1930 book about the killing of one hugely unlikable Colonel Protheroe (Derek Jacobi) in Jane Marple's pretty home village of St. Mary Mead. Typically, there is no end of likely suspects, but what makes the investigation unusual is a pair of competing confessions from two illicit lovers (Jason Flemyng, Janet McTeer). Stephen Tompkinson (Ballykissangel) is very good as a police inspector who slowly develops admiration for Miss Marple's keen mind. \"The Body in the Library\" finds Marple aiding the brassy Dolly Bantry (Lumley) after the latter finds the body of an unknown woman in her library. Callow is wonderful as another cop who initially underestimates the heroine's gifts. \"A Murder Is Announced,\" in which a killing is advertised before it happens, and \"4:50 from Paddington,\" about a murder without a body, round out the set with imaginative plots and memorable performances. Don't miss the special featurette in which McEwan and others talk about the endless appeal of Miss Marple.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000GAKFIG", "B000R349JI", "B001UWOLQG", "B002MUAXJY", "B005X5XINI", "B004VLYHNA", "B00GWXHYPI", "B00GWXI0S8", "B005X5XI4C", "B00GWXI2MC", "B00D7AM2V0", "B006Z4LP9K", "B00EF0NYVI", "B007ISJS0U", "B006JY3O2M", "B0083HXKM2", "B00DW5IKWK", "B000068UE9", "B00A0HT99G", "B000CRR36K", "B0028AENVC", "B004HHX9H8", "B005DVIPY4", "B004WMOSNM", "B001V7YZAM", "B0090XLDO0", "B00GWXI16O", "B00HHYF548", "B00JJRLFTU", "B000GB5M1K", "B00GWXI20E", "B00GHH9I62", "B00CEBJCF2", "B001KP2J3K", "B00GAH87RK", "B00CEBJCBQ", "B00A27O5AW", "B006X202AM", "B0028LOT7O", "B00GAXASKS", "B00A8KJLPM", "B00GAXASLC", "B001V7YZA2", "B0009S4IN8", "B00HYZ0ZLS", "B009DS6YGO", "B009D4RW96", "B003AND1TG", "B00GWXI2RM", "B00GWXI1F0", "B0023Y543Y", "B004HJ0ZLE", "B009DS5OEM", "B000K7UBUM", "B00C888LOO", "B00CLF81Z8", "B00ANGIBV6", "B001V7YZ9S", "B004AE3QUS", "B00HHYF55C", "B00C12ZISE", "B003YCI238", "B0050N0US4", "B001KP2J44", "B0047CG95W", "B00ANGIAU8", "B001B43IUS", "B002MUAXJ4", "B00GAHJO8G", "B00005U8F2", "B0053O8AGY", "B00BDSRM4K", "B000CRR3EC", "B00GWXI0M4", "B008N8A3DA", "B00CEBJC84", "B00IT3KP96", "B0002HODEK", "B00EV1YZD2", "B00ANGICCO", "1569385882", "B00331RHPO", "B0006212JK", "B006MK5YUI", "B001V7YZAC", "B00IBKXP8A", "B005A1GREM", "B001O4C6NA", "B006MK4QKW", "B00H4ZEFTQ", "B00007KLE8", "B003L80FLC", "B004MYOXRQ", "B00AEFYO5I", "B00GD7UO4G", "B006MK6Y8Y", "B000199JJI", "B0007GP70U", "B003WKQ46Y", "B007T40GOK"], "bought_together": ["B000GAKFIG", "B000R349JI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003YCI238", "B000GAKFIG", "B000R349JI", "B002MUAXJY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 26793}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 17.88, "brand": "MCEWAN,GERALDINE", "asin": "B0007Y3XRG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TjWgjCQYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Agatha Christie's Marple: Series 1"}

At this point, superlatives don't doThe Sopranosjustice, but justice was at last served to this benchmark series.James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano in a not-so-nice moodFor the first time,The Sopranosrubbed outThe West Wingto take home its first Emmy&#174; for Outstanding Dramatic Series. Michael Imperioli and Drea de Matteo also earned Best Supporting Actor and Actress honors for some of their finest hours as Christopher and Adriana. From the moment a wayward bear lumbers into the Sopranos' yard in the season opener, it is clear thatThe Sopranosis in anything but a \"stagmire.\" The series benefits from an infusion of new blood, the so-called \"Class of 2004,\" imprisoned \"family\" members freshly released from jail. Most notable among these is Tony's cousin, Tony Blundetto (Steve Buscemi, who directed the pivotal season three episode \"Pine Barrens\"!  ), who initially wants to go straight, but proves himself to be something of a \"free agent,\" setting up a climactic stand-off between Tony and New York boss Johnny Sack.Carmela and TonyThese 13 mostly riveting episodes unfold with a page-turning intensity with many rich subplots. Estranged couple Tony and Carmela (the incomparable James Gandolfini and Edie Falco) work toward a reconciliation (greased by Tony's purchase of a $600,000 piece of property for Carmela to develop). The Feds lean harder on an increasingly stressed-out and distraught Adriana to \"snitch\" with inevitable results. This season's hot-button episode is \"The Test Dream,\" in which Tony is visited by some of the series' dear, and not-so-dearly, departed in a harrowing nightmare. With this set, fans can enjoy marathon viewings of an especially satisfying season, but considering the long wait ahead for season six, best to take Tony's advice to his son, who, at one point, gulps down a champagne toast. \"Slow down,\" Tony says. \"You're supposed to savor it.\"--Donald LiebensonExplore MoreFor an even deeper immersion into the world of crime (movies, that is) see our guides tocrime classicsand our who's who compendium offamous mob bosses.Bada Bing!

{"description": "From Hollywood's legendary Cocoanut Grove to the pioneering conquest of the wild blue yonder, Martin Scorsese'sThe Aviatorcelebrates old-school filmmaking at its finest. We say \"old school\" only because Scorsese's love of golden-age Hollywood is evident in his approach to his subject--Howard Hughes in his prime (played by Leonardo DiCaprio in his)--and especially in his technical mastery of the medium reflecting his love for classical filmmaking of the studio era. Even when he's using state-of-the-art digital trickery for the film's exciting flight scenes (including one of the most spectacular crashes ever filmed), Scorsese's meticulous attention to art direction and costume design suggests an impassioned pursuit of craftsmanship from a bygone era; every frame seems to glow with gilded detail. And while DiCaprio bears little physical resemblance to Hughes during the film's 20-year span (late 1920s to late '40s), he efficiently captures the eccentric millionaire's golden-boy essence, and his tragic descent into obsessive-compulsive seclusion. Bolstered by Cate Blanchett's uncannily accurate portrayal of Katharine Hepburn as Hughes' most beloved lover,The Aviatoris easily Scorsese's most accessible film, inviting mainstream popularity without compromising Scorsese's artistic reputation. As compelling crowd-pleasers go, it's a class act from start to finish.--Jeff ShannonDVD FeaturesIn his commentary track, director Martin Scorsese offers his own impressions of Howard Hughes and rattles off his memories of experiencing Hughes's films.  He mentions how he made Cate Blanchett watch every Katharine Hepburn film from the '30s on the big screen, and observes that Kate Beckinsale had \"a real sense of the stature of a Hollywood goddess.\"  But in general he doesn't talk much about the craft of making the film.  That area is covered better by editor Thelma Schoonmaker, who also appears on the commentary track, and producer Michael Mann makes a few appearances (all were recorded separately).  The picture is brilliant, but the 5.1 sound is not as aggressive in the rear speakers and subwoofer as one might expect, other than some nice surround effects in theHell's Angelsflying sequence.The second disc collects almost three hours of features.  There's one unnecessary deleted scene, and an 11-minute making-of featurette that's basically the cast and director heaping praise on each other.  More interesting are the short featurettes on visual effects (including the XF-11 scene, of course), production design, costumes, hair and makeup, and score, and Loudon Wainwright discusses his and his children's musical performances.  Historical perspective is provided by spotlights on Hughes's role in aviation and his obsessive-compulsive disorder, and a 43-minute Hughes documentary from the History Channel (part of the Modern Marvels series, it focuses on his mechanical innovations and spends less than a minute on his movies).  More unusual are DiCaprio and Scorsese's appearance on an OCD panel, and a half-hour interview segment DiCaprio did with Alan Alda.--David HoriuchiThe Personalities ofThe AviatorClick the links to explore more movies by these stars.Leonardo DiCaprioasHoward Hughes\"Sometimes I truly fear that I... am losing my mind.

{"description": "Isao Takahata's outr&#xE9; ecological fablePom Pokowas the no. 1 domestic film in Japan in 1994, and the first animated feature to be submitted for the Oscar for Foreign Language Film. In 1967, the raccoons in the Tama Hills find their homes are threatened with destruction when developers turn the rural area into suburbs. Under the leadership of their tribal elders the animals fight back with every resource at their disposal. Raccoons are shape-shifters in Japanese folk tales, and the members of this tribe can transform into objects, other creatures and even humans.Unlike Takahata's deeply movingThe Grave of the Fireflies,Pom Poko(the sound made by thumping the tummy of a comfortably full raccoon) is a broad comedy. The raccoons' efforts to understand humans, their evocations of traditional ghost stories to frighten construction crews, and their internecine quarrels offers plenty of laughs. But the story rambles, and the characters lack the depth needed to sustain the audience's interest until the film's belated, downbeat conclusion. The extras include Takahata's storyboards, which are interesting, but lack the magic of Hayao Miyazaki's drawings on other Studio Ghibli discs. Note: male raccoons have prominent testicles, which are shown in Japanese art, including the designs forPom Poko. When the characters grow desperate, they swell their scrotums to enormous size and use them as weapons.

{"description": "The Andy Griffith Showhit its stride during its third season (1962-63), admirably restored in this five-disc, 32-episode boxed set. Andy Griffith perfects his levelheaded Sheriff Andy Taylor; Don Knotts is unsurpassed as the comically neurotic Barney Fife; and Ron Howard continues his legendary run as earnest Opie. The season opens with the endearing episode \"Mr. McBeevee,\" Opie's friend in the trees who Andy believes to be a figment of his son's imagination. From there, every disc contains renowned classics, such as \"Floyd, the Gay Deceiver\" starring the dashing Howard McNear; \"Andy and Opie, Bachelors\" offering some of the season's greatest quips; and \"The Darlings Are Coming,\" that crazy clan of mountain musicians including the overtly flirtatious Charlene. The season is acclaimed for introducing several new, recurring characters into the cast including Gomer Pyle (Jim Nabors), \"Miss Peggy\" (Joanna Moore), and Helen Crump (Aneta Corsaut). Except for two episodes missing closing epilogue scenes (which Paramount discloses), the set contains 13 hours of full-length, uncut, black-and-white magic. Also included is the originally aired \"Fishin' Hole\"  theme music throughout the collection, as well as more than two dozen \"Sponsor Spots,\" vintage commercial advertisements featuring the show's cast. Don't miss the season highlight, \"Man In A Hurry,\" a touching story where Malcolm Tucker delivers the now-famous summation of Mayberry, \"Outrageous&#x85; a whole town is standing still because two old women's feet fall asleep,\" precisely the reason why this beloved sitcom remains a timeless treasure.

{"description": "The setting ofKontrollis the Budapest subway system, one of the largest and oldest in the world, and a place that becomes an omniscient character in an ambitious film that jumbles dark comedy, slick action, and horror-movie conventions.

He has taken to sleeping on empty platforms and getting progressively more unkempt as he accumulates more bruises, bloody noses, and bitterness from his scraps with a variety of unseemly creatures of the night (and day). Among the post-punk, post-communist habitu&#xE9;s of this subterranean metropolis are a cute girl in a teddy-bear suit, a rival gang of ticket inspectors who like to play a deadly game of chicken with express trains, and a hooded specter who may or may not be pushing people under subway wheels at crowded stops.

{"description": "When a baby girl appears on the doorstep of a Parisian apartment belonging to a trio of hedonistic bachelors, baby care is thrust upon them with hilarious and, ultimately, heartwarming results in this 1985 French comedy (with English subtitles) by writer/director Coline Serreau. Pierre, Michel, and Jacques are pleasure-seeking professionals with the singular goal to seduce women in their spare time. When Jacques leaves on a three-week vacation, a mix-up ensues and roommates Pierre and Michel (Roland Giraud and Michel Boujenah, respectively) discover that the \"package\" Jacques has enlisted them to watch in his absence is a cooing infant in a pink bassinette. With no prior experience and unable to contact Jacques (Andr&#xE9; Dussollier) to whom the baby was \"addressed,\" they dive into the frenzied fracas of diapers and feeding schedules. Adding insult to insanity, they must fend off drug dealers&#x97;and police--interested in another \"package.\" The simple storyline leaves plenty of room for shenanigans&#x97;formulaic perhaps, but still irresistible. Rather than a morality play on the recklessness of child abandonment, farcical comedy prevails. Over time, the men are smitten with little Marie who gives them plenty of adorable moments until they can't live without her. The obvious appeal of the story inspired the American remake two years later, though the French version is more compelling, nuanced, and touching. Parents should take note of the PG-13 rating for excessive profanity and sexual content.

{"description": "Here are 18 more eye-popping episodes from HBO's shiver-shudder-and-shriek anthology series, adapted from the pages of E.C. Comics' legendary horror comics. Season 2 ofTales from the Cryptdoesn't back down from the promise made by its debut season: some of the biggest names in Hollywood do their best in front of and behind the camera to deliver the gory goods, with a healthy dash ofTales' signature coal-black humor. There's Demi Moore as a classic E.C. femme fatale in Howard Deutch's \"Dead Right\";Desperate Housewives' Teri Hatcher co-stars with a reanimated corpse in \"The Thing from the Grave\"; Iggy Pop and the voice of Sam Kinison are featured in a sinister story of music and murder in \"For Cryin' Out Loud\"; and Arnold Schwarzenegger makes his directorial debut with the macabre \"The Switch.\" Series co-producers Walter Hill and Richard Donner also contribute creepfests, as do horror vets Jack Sholder, Tom Holland, and special effects designer Chris Walas; other performers facing fearsome fates include Patricia Arquette, Don Rickles, Bobcat Goldthwait, Lance Henriksen, and Harry Anderson. The three-disc set definitely delivers a triple treat of terror, but unfortunately, the supplemental features are a little (ahem) anemic, especially in comparison to the solid extras in thefirst-season set. Here, fans only get a short behind-the-scenes featurette that focuses mainly on actor John Kassir, who provides the Crypt Keeper's voice, and a glimpse at aTalesepisode done for radio with Tim Curry.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000E1MXWS", "B0009ETCOW", "B003NKU9XM", "B000FFJYC0", "B000SULWKO", "B006BZ8NSE", "B000GYI322", "B000P0J0E2", "B000Q66Q56", "B004SUDQCW", "B000RXVNCO", "B001LM64VA", "B003VJTGNE", "B002HK9HZU", "B002GHHHG0", "B0053TWV46", "B00363WGIM", "B003VJTGMU", "B00013D54Y", "B00BTYPW7C", "B000HEVZ94", "B0007CEXUY", "B00GHH9IIA", "B0002CX1M0", "1616552905", "B0024FAG44", "B000GYI340", "B00EALTVPA", "B00005LQ0Z", "B0000AOX0B", "B00IOSZFF0", "B00KTFJ50M", "B000099T3M", "B000069I05", "B00HRUQ7WG", "B0000AOX0C", "B000RIWAV2", "B000FFJZO2", "B00HRUQB8Q", "B002JHD9D2", "B000N2HD6Y", "B000068TPD", "B00A429Y56", "B00009YXHN", "B002OVO18A", "B00CBFB8WG", "B00HRCBGRA", "B004GSVXA8", "B00005JOJE", "B000FEBWTE", "B008CYDD7I", "B00IOSZE0Q", "B000WC384Q", "B000UYX4PO", "B0001ZX0GK", "B0002KQNL8", "B004AC6PMG", "B002FU8JTM", "B001B1UO6W", "B00GSMZ3I8", "B002AMVEII", "B00006FDBT", "B0002NY8XA", "B002I41KNC", "B000IFQLLE", "B002GPVDMG", "B002EP8FDI", "B00005JN8Q", "078322799X", "B000RL21N6", "B005CM1ILQ", "B00K1L4NBU", "B000H1RFXM", "B000068IEV", "B00009MEC4", "B008JFUNYG", "B002XD0J80", "B000FA57U8", "B0002NRRRE", "B000I2J68M", "B000E0WJR8", "B0002VYOVS", "B0006Z2NYA", "B000DZ95IU", "B00AEFYUW0", "B001DXS4DI", "B003VE9WP6", "B000TUDFDU", "B002LMSWN2", "B000BOH986", "B00009PY4G", "B002FLOTPO", "B0000CABL2", "B0000AOX0D", "B003JFCG82", "B00006FI0R", "B00AIANIPQ", "B005J9ZFQG", "B0029WGIDK", "0783232039"], "bought_together": ["B000E1MXWS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0030E5PYO", "B006BZ8NSE", "B003NKU9XM", "B000SULWKO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 26186}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 11.99, "brand": "WEA", "asin": "B000A88EU0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513uNPyJahL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tales from the Crypt: Season 2"}

{"description": "One of the best mystery tales of all time,The Moonstone, based on Wilkie Collins' 1868 novel, is the story of a stolen Hindu diamond that makes its way into the care of Franklin Blake (Greg Wise ofSense and Sensibility). Acting as executor of the estate of the late Colonel John Herncastle (Terrence Hardiman), Franklin is obliged to deliver the diamond, called the Moonstone, to Herncastle's niece, Rachel Verinder (Keeley Hawes ofTipping the Velvet). The two fall in love, but after the disappearance of the Moonstone, Rachel refuses to speak to Franklin or anyone else, and rebuffs an investigation by a renowned detective (Antony Sher), who suspects Rachel herself is involved with the apparent theft. The long trail to the truth is endlessly surprising, requiring the participation of a number of fascinating characters who each contribute something to the solution. A handsome production directed by Robert Bierman (Vampire's Kiss),The Moonstoneis most entertaining whenever Sher is on screen, humming incessantly, prattling on about roses, and sharing scenes with such estimable supporting players as Patricia Hodge (Betrayal) and Peter Vaughan (The Remains of the Day).--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009OL92K", "B0009PVZM8", "B001EJZNDU", "B000GAKFI6", "B000E0ODZE", "B00005JOA0", "B00HUAGYF8", "B000NIBUP8", "B0001WTUJO", "0486424510", "B00062IZ0Y", "B0077PBPVE", "B00I6JODGO", "B00BOTCJXC", "B000EBD9VC", "0140434119", "B00HUAGZ34", "B000FL7CBY", "B000Z27HLS", "B001P807RC", "B000GIXLUC", "B000089QEM", "B007A2O3FO", "B0031RAP5O", "B008RO6PJQ", "B0009PVZKU", "B000M2E32M", "B000A8AXXG", "B004XVMCMQ", "B00C888LOO", "B00A27OJ94", "B000AYEL6U", "B00CEBJC20", "B00D49YFAA", "B0011KQSZ4", "B0077PBPJ6", "B001H9JBW6", "B00H4ZEFTQ", "B000FFJYA2", "B001PU8MZO", "B000784WNQ", "B006JY3OH2", "B006P0FIGU", "B00065GX96", "B008OTTTP6", "B0090XUARQ", "B001AXL67W", "B001PU8N0I", "B008220C38", "B000Z27HMW", "B00005YUNK", "0199556113", "B0080QOL10", "B00D49YEHO", "B00AF82WTO", "B00E3UN44W", "B003UD7J94", "B006H3KQOE", "B00HGE90Z4", "B00F1BFRA6", "B004JMSIQS", "B004132HZS", "B000LPQ6DE", "B000LXHK2C", "B000LW7L1I", "B0007TKOGE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000GAKFI6", "B0009OL92K", "B0007LFPJ8", "B0077PBPVE"]}, "price": 35.71, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 53441}, "asin": "B000AYELC4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51W8XTNEJ8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Moonstone"}

{"description": "A double tour, Claude Chabrol's third film, is his debut psychological thriller, a genre he subsequently transformed in films like Les Bonnes Femmes and L'Enfer. Through (expert use of flashbacks and vignettes - NY Times) Chabrol creates a lurid and disturbing melodrama of infidelity, obsession and murder at a vineyard in rural Provence.Vintner Henri Marcoux (Jacques Dacqmine) brazenly carries on an affair with a beautiful young neighbor (Antonella Lualdi) right under the nose of his bitter wife Th&#xE9;r&#xE8;se (Madeleine Robinson). Henri's gorgeous daughter has herself caught the eye of a Hungarian ne'er do well (Jean-Paul Belmondo), while Henri's voyeur son begins to take liberties with his father's mistress. As the family's passions ripen, the stage is set for tragedy.Demonstrating (a flair for the camera and characterization - NY Times) Chabrol leads his gifted cast through (fine performances - NY Times). Italo-Greek ing&#xE9;nue Antonella Lualdi is a (dark, striking beauty who could easily turn a man's head - NY Times), and storied French stage actress Madeleine Robinson (Orson Welles' The Trial) received the Best Actress prize at the 1959 Venice Film Festival for her role. Belmondo is magnetic in his final part before Breathless (in which he used his character's name from A double tour as an alias) catapulted him to international stardom.Released in the US as Leda in 1961, Variety called A double tour a (sleek whodunit,) with (good camera work and tricky direction.) Viewed today, A double tour's swooping camera and character eccentricity echo both Alfred Hitchcock's most personal and obsessive films and Douglas Sirk's colorful 1950s melodramas.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004HY8NZE", "B000NDFI38", "B004JP4ETU", "B0044ES7RQ", "B0056ANHJA", "0780023110", "B001HSNTGQ", "B008RNYMPG", "B00004WMMO", "B000GYI3IG", "B0056ANHR2", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B00008K79H", "B00080OB9I", "B00A1TATYM", "B0001EFV9A", "B0056ANHQI", "B0001ZIYDO", "B00007G1XR", "B00007G1XU", "B0039BEEWC", "B00008AOTB", "B00026L7MW", "B00005TNFA", "B00007G1XZ", "B002XUL6QC", "B005J7K9AA", "B00007G1XQ", "B001BEK8BU", "B0006HC0GY", "B00007G1Y1", "B004KDYR2A", "B001BEK8BK", "B00008G8YK", "B00007G1XG", "B00026L7N6", "B0009PW45K", "B00152VXUI", "B00K6J7SFU", "B0026MP1AO"], "bought_together": ["B00008K79H"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0044ES7RQ", "B00007G1XR", "B00026L7MW", "B004HY8NZE"]}, "price": 17.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 280514}, "asin": "B000BT994S", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PB2ZFWDFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Double Tour"}

{"description": "In his third feature, director Noah Baumbach scores a triumph with an autobiographical coming-of-age story about a teenager whose writer-parents are divorcing.  The father (Jeff Daniels) and mother (Laura Linney) duke it out in half-civilized, half-savage fashion, while their two sons adapt in different ways, shifting allegiances between parents.  The film is squirmy-funny and nakedly honest about the rationalizations and compensatory snobbisms of artistic failure as well as the conflicted desires of adolescents for sex and status.  In detailing bohemian-bourgeois life in brownstone Brooklyn, Baumbach is spot on.  Everyone proceeds from good intentions and acts rather badly, in spite or because of their manifest intelligence.  Fulfilling the best traditions of the American independent film, this quirky, wisely written feature explores the gulf between sexes, generations, art and commerce, Brooklyn and Manhattan.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767821408", "6305428239", "B0010X8NF0", "B0000640VJ", "B0007UC8Y4", "B001QOGYBI", "B002ZG97T2", "B0011NVC8Y", "B007L6VR12", "B000FUF7DA", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B0006TPE4C", "B00005JLX8", "B00007AJF8", "B00005JLRE", "B0014GI6I2", "B00000G02H", "B001P3SA8K", "B004SEUIW4", "B003102JDM", "B00005JMJG", "B00H9HZITU", "B0024HH2WG", "081099741X", "B0081FSMII", "B00005JMJ4", "B003Q7B7CO", "B001E95ZNS", "B00EO2I6SI", "B003L20ICE", "B008220DGE", "B002ZG97TC", "B0035G5IOE", "B009B8YZCQ", "B000C20VVE", "B007L6VR6M", "B0083V2W4U", "B003KGBIS4", "B00003CXQ4", "B000K7VHQE", "B000E33VWW", "B000BX8R1A", "B007UW9W32", "B00003CWTI", "B003N82OP0", "B008Y1YJMM", "B001HN699A", "B000M4RG7E", "B00AEFY8MM", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00GMV8KGW", "B000M5B98A", "B005LAIGF0", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B00JAQJNN0", "B00J5LXQKQ", "B00005AUJK", "B003UESJLU", "B00005Q4CS", "1572527005", "B0016MJ6HY", "B001UV4XGU", "B0089XJXRQ", "B002AFX53M", "B003U6SJYU", "B00IXPQU6M", "B00CIOD6HK", "B001UV4XUG", "B0045O2PHS", "B00007976U", "B005HK13SG", "B000PAAJZ6", "B00606P0BM", "B0002DB52M", "B001DJ7PR8", "B00AEFYSWM", "B004UVYQVY", "B00004XPP8", "B002LVVCJY", "0802867189", "0830827048", "B00008K7AO", "B00D3LA5WG", "B0012E2GFK", "B001CW7ZT4", "B0007OCG5G", "B00005JLSK", "B00AG4760C", "B000FVQM2Y", "0809141183", "0830828052", "B004UXUX4Q", "B000CNESTE", "0205827195", "B00008DP4C", "6304907729", "B005PTMPYA", "B00003CXDJ", "B0042U9B3G", "B0008JIJ10"], "bought_together": ["0767821408", "6305428239"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007UC8Y4", "B0010X8NF0", "B0000640VJ", "0767821408"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 67820}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.54, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000CS464G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q2MVZ5QRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Squid and the Whale (Special Edition)"}

{"description": "No collection of classic TV Westerns is complete withoutCheyenne, the trailblazing 1955 series that premiered within weeks ofGunsmoke. The strapping Clint Walker stars as Cheyenne Bodie, the iconic role that earned him his place in the Hall of Great Western Performers at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City. Cheyenne is a classic Western hero in the drifter tradition, accepting jobs ranging from frontier scout to trail boss. In this first season, he is accompanied at times by sidekick Smitty (L.Q. Jones). \"It takes about a minute to know a man,\" one character remarks during the course ofCheyenne's first season. But we size up Cheyenne in an instant. He is a man of honor, straight shooting and plainspoken. In one episode, he declines an offered position of ranch foreman. \"I don't like the job,\" he states, \"and when I don't like a job, I turn it down.\" When a woman refers to Indians as \"savages\" in the first episode, Cheyenne enlightens her, \"The Indians think we're the savages.\" Several episodes, including \"Quicksand\" and \"The Last Train West,\" echo the John Ford masterpiece,Stagecoach, as Cheyenne finds himself amongst a diverse and disparate group of people who are thrown together by circumstance.Cheyennewas part of a new breed of \"adult Western.\" The episode \"Johnny Bravo\" (was this the inspiration for Greg's rock star nom de plume onThe Brady Bunch?) deals with a rancher who disapproves of his daughter's affair with a Mexican. Keep a sharp lookout for actors who would later become Hollywood's most wanted. A pre-MaverickJames Garner appears as different characters in three episodes. Dennis Hopper is hot-triggered gunfighter the Utah Kid, in \"Quicksand.\" And that's the future Miss Hathaway, Nancy Kulp, as a sassy waitress in \"Johnny Bravo.\"Cheyennewas originally broadcast as one of three rotating series under the banner,Warner Brothers Presents, but it quickly established itself as the runaway hit. Like the best Westerns, it is anything but quaint nostalgia. With its timeless setting, compelling stories, charismatic hero, and positive values, the sun will never set onCheyenne.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000TQZBNQ", "B006W95BWA", "B009RNK0YC", "B00BR0SECI", "B00E8RVSZC", "B007AAF3FK", "B00GJT22VQ", "B005TZFYWA", "B000F9T70K", "B00668IFWA", "B00B00HUC0", "B000A0GXH4", "B005LVIP1E", "B003ZFXE82", "B00E96AY20", "B000EHSVB4", "B00AWWX7X8", "B000PHX5KU", "B00192BNJU", "B00KTZALDC", "B002DH20PQ", "B000VS6R3A", "B007RUZ29A", "B005UFUU6E", "B009RNK13M", "B004H0M34K", "B009V2KO9K", "B003VKVTL0", "B000NOIX7U", "B009OE2NS0", "B003BTO4HM", "B004L5GY82", "B00IU6HPIQ", "B000EOR0BY", "B0001JXQ2Y", "B006ZL1P84", "B00IS6WQ2S", "B004HHX9T6", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B00DOZNIVG", "B009OE2NZI", "B00G3BRCBU", "B004PQM81E", "B003552QUO", "B0002W4TVM", "B004IY1AVM", "B002XY5EAC", "B005D7E7Y0", "B00I1GUS0C", "B0064CT90U", "B00F6D62O4", "B00CL151ZU", "B00IP965IO", "B0025Y3SZS", "B007V4ETS2", "B00A6SZRT0", "B001JAHPMG", "B009DA74DY", "B000W8OM68", "B001E6JC1W", "B005PTYPK2", "B00CL151P0", "B007V973KI", "B00A2XQTFK", "B001MZVZGA", "B001072DFM", "B0013LRKVM", "B00BAXTY9O", "B005D7E7PY", "B001TWT0CW", "B00082ZROO", "B00A92MBIS", "B00BXTDVEO", "B009INAHZS", "B008OIQZ36", "B0013LRKY4", "B00BAXTYGW", "B00J9BZ4KC", "B00769U98Q", "B0055SJY86", "B00JEZWRE4", "B009ERK2UI", "B0083TUEDS", "B001E6HUXO", "B0006Z2L1A", "B004Q0VR5C", "B00AMDA2OY", "B0046S8MRU", "B00AX5B0RY", "B004T0XYLE", "B003XEKXYI", "B00A4Y614G", "B0008FXSSI", "B00H7BJ0WO", "B00H7BJ1I2", "B004GSVX8A", "B00CCYNYBO", "B0030Y12BE", "B0013D8M4E"], "bought_together": ["B000TQZBNQ", "B006W95BWA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000TQZBNQ", "B00E96AY20", "B00E8RVSZC", "B006W95BWA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9392}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 11.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000EQ46H8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61u4edac2gL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cheyenne - The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "The beloved tale ofHeidi, the Swiss miss whose indomitable spirit touches all those around her, despite having been dealt a harsh hand in life, gets a spunky boost in this 2005 film adaptation. A stellar cast includes Max von Sydow as Grandfather, a roiling-with-inner-rage Geraldine Chaplin as Rottenmeier, and a benevolent Diana Rigg as Grandmamma. At the center of their world--like it or not--is Heidi, played with irrepressible optimism by the adorable Emma Bolger. As the orphaned Heidi is flung from home to home, city to city, valley to mountain, by those who profess not to want her, she accepts her fate and still manages to cast sunshine on her bleak situation. This version features breathtaking scenery--Grandfather's mountain aerie looks more like a Canadian Rockies summer spread than a place of self-imposed solitary confinement. At times the pan-European cast gives the film a feel of being the United Nations on location; Chaplin and Rigg's upper-crust British accents clash with von Sydow's clipped Swedish delivery, and Bolger's accent adorably reflects her Dublin roots. (Only the goats truly look Swiss.) But the story ofHeidihas a huge heart, and this film is family entertainment in the best sense of the word.--A.T.

{"description": "Executive-produced bySuperman Returnsdirector Bryan Singer and narrated by star Kevin Spacey,Look, Up in the Sky: The Amazing Story of Supermanis an exhaustive, nearly two-hour documentary covering over 60 years of the Man of Steel. It begins with the early work of Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster leading to the 1938Action Comicsdebut of Superman, then continues through the Max Fleischer cartoons, the Columbia serials, to the 1950sAdventures of Supermanseries and the tragic suicide of its star, George Reeves. Then it's on to the 1966 Broadway musical, the 1970s feature films (including screen tests of Stockard Channing and Lesley Anne Warren), the paralysis and death of star Christopher Reeve, the subsequent TV seriesLois & ClarkandSmallville, and the 2006 featureSuperman Returns. The documentary also discusses Superman's transformations during World War II, the atomic age, and the 1960s; events in the comic books such as John Byrne's reboot andThe Death of Superman; and obscurities such as a pilot forThe Adventures of Superpupand the TV-musical version ofIt's a Bird&#x85; It's a Plane&#x85; It's Superman.  Interview subjects range from two-production stars such as Noel Neill and Jack Larson (who were in bothAdventures of SupermanandSuperman Returns), and Annette O'Toole (Superman IIIandSmallville) to producer Ilya Salkind, director Richard Donner, Margot Kidder, Stan Lee, Dean Cain, and Brandon Routh. The animated series deserves more coverage, and some interviewees are conspicuously absent--no surpriseLois & Clark's Teri Hatcher couldn't find the time, but what aboutSmallville's Tom Welling?--but overall it's an impressive and engaging examination of the DC Comics icon.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003ZHR6Q6", "B000HWZ4E8", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B000A5046K", "B000BT96FA", "B000I8OM94", "B00LT1JKN2", "1400068665", "B00EE8AJ50", "B000EU1Q2M", "B001OD8E4G", "B00E4Q6UVY", "B002K0WBDM", "B00AKK6MD4", "B000IJ79WU", "B000J10EQU", "B000AQOHNA", "B000ION23U", "B00DX88IL4", "B00G7QPX6C", "B000IJ79UW", "B000IJ79VQ", "B004EXWGJW", "1401247040", "B0049IHWYG", "B001DJLD2G", "6305943389", "B00080ZG2O", "B000OPODNQ", "B000BT96EG", "B00I40K6RU", "1781165998", "B0018BDDFE", "B00BBXSPES", "B00BBXSPCK", "B008MZZCZI", "B0007G89FU", "B002LWJ510", "B005G5NPD8", "B005DGKBDC", "B000TSTEJG", "B000Y5CJNC", "B00F4FFO8E", "B00HMOW9YM", "1449447155", "B00BBAQD6S", "B000OPODNG", "B000KWZ7JC", "B000PE0G0A", "B00006672S", "B000B7QCGS", "B000F4RH8E", "B008JFUPFI", "B0002ZMHX6", "1465408754", "B000BUE5D2", "1401241891", "B000051SH3", "B001ECQ5SY", "B00AKK6LM6", "B00DYEN6XC", "B00E4Q6U82", "B000PC8AKK", "B00GD9GNUS", "B000067IY3", "B0029WGIDK", "1563891492", "B002S3Y1LQ", "1401238173", "B0008KLVB4", "B00BVG7ETC", "B009M4KT3I", "B00BHLTIXQ", "1605490547", "B004EE2ZY2", "1401207642", "B00023E88U", "0811821625", "B004UQPM4E", "B008MILYYI", "1605490555", "1118341848", "B001F3FUK6", "0756620678", "B00A3THVGE", "B00GD9GNEY", "1605490466", "B00CENWUYK", "B000GYI33Q", "1401235476", "B000GRUMPU", "B003HKN548", "B003Z8ZCDO", "B00308B170", "B007MCSV1O", "B000O599W6", "B000LE17A2", "B003Q7B7BU", "B003F3NE4S", "B003XMKU0M"], "bought_together": ["B003ZHR6Q6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000HWZ4E8", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B000BT96FA", "B000A5046K"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 62876}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.23, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000FO0AHY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513SHSZ8VXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Look, Up in the Sky!: The Amazing Story of Superman"}

{"description": "A disturbing film about a young Belgian couple and their newborn child,L'Enfanttells a heartbreaking tale that is less about love than about the possibility of moral redemption. We quickly learn what kind of people Sonia and Bruno are. Sonia (Deborah Francois) is a sweet teenager who has just given birth to Bruno's (Jeremie Renier) child. Instead of visiting her and seeing their baby in the hospital, Bruno sublets her apartment to \"friends\" who slam the door in her face when she tries to return home. We do not know what Sonia does for a living, but we know she's diligent enough to maintain a small apartment and keep her pantry stocked with instant soup. Bruno, on the other hand, refuses to take a job. Instead, he leads a gang of thieves who're approximately half his age (and height). Still, Sonia loves him. And Bruno, who may be incapable of love, enjoys the carefree benefits of having a girlfriend who doesn't expect too much. All this changes when Bruno does the unthinkable--he sells their child. He calmly explains to her, \"I thought we'd have another.\" Overnight, Sonia changes from a little girl to a bitter woman who no longer excuses Bruno's behavior. When he returns to her apartment claiming he loves her, she spits back, \"You're lying. You can't help it.\" Not realizing the irony of his own actions, he then begs her for money. Renier and Francois are formidable actors who convey feelings with subtle nuances. Though the film is in French, the viewer never feels lost. The subtitles certainly help, but the actors are so good that their intonations and expressions speak volumes themselves.L'Enfant--a 2005 Cannes winner by filmmaking brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne--is a brutal film to watch not because of any gore or violence, but because of the frailty of the characters and their desperation to survive. In his quest to return the child to Sonia, Bruno attempts to become a better human being. But the viewer is never left with the satisfaction of knowing that he will ever be able to truly redeem himself.--Jae-Ha Kim", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002U6DVOY", "B0001JXP16", "B0083V2VZ0", "B0083V2W18", "B00AIBZLHS", "B00A8QDI1Y", "B0083V2VXC", "B00HVOFP6W", "B002BWP4A6", "B00151QYE4", "B00000F7E6", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B00K0MM4AM", "B00A8QDHUQ", "B0001EFUFK", "B0000C9JFO", "B000I8OOG0", "B0087OULO6", "B00092ZLEY", "B00GPPXNLC", "B00HE010QM", "B00IGK6TH4", "B00AIBZLR8", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B00HE011DE", "B00HRJVHEK", "B00009OOFG", "B000B9EYFW", "B0083V2W54", "B004Q0CHB0", "B002AG2NTI", "B009VO9XSG", "B0084O26SI", "B000YAA68W", "B00006ADG1", "B002BWP3UC", "B0002KQOH6", "B000P6R9NK", "B0036TGTDO", "B002AFX53C", "B00002RAPT", "B00080Z53O", "B00005JKJA", "B0035ECHIG", "B003ICZW7S", "B001152TL6", "B00GPPXP6A", "B00005UK01", "B0000B1A5P", "B00002VWE0", "B0036TGSJE", "B000059TON", "B0000C2IQP", "B00023P4N8", "B0006GAOJA", "6305362688", "B00HVOFP9O", "B000PKG6O4", "0780618564", "B00HVOFP08", "B00HXH00ZI", "B00005N8A9", "B0007OCG5G", "B0041KKYF6", "B001MPS7GG", "B004SUDQ22", "B00003CXKS", "B000296E7W", "B005MXQD74", "B00HB3AP9A", "0767812158", "B002E2M5IC", "6305744114", "0671604295", "B00005J75R", "B00AZNEVNE", "B00GPPXNIK", "B000OVLBGC", "B000I8OMEY", "B00FGVRZOM", "B0002DB52M", "B00007J5VT", "B00005JL57", "B00009MEA0", "B0029O0BK4", "B0077E8RFC", "B00GA9F2PI", "B00421IR5I", "B001QFYCZM", "B00FGVRZR4", "0231163290", "B008CJ0JS4", "B000A5044C", "B00004TBFS", "B00005M2C7", "6305081034", "B0054QHHHE", "B006TTC5MM", "B001EOQCMG"], "bought_together": ["B002U6DVOY", "B0001JXP16"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00A8QDI1Y", "B001THZAAI", "B0083V2W18", "B00151QYE4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 123246}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.99, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000G0O5IM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519ND3S0K4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "L'enfant (The Child)"}

{"description": "In the mid-'70s,Familywas sort of the anti-All in the Family--dealing with the issues of the day, but far more sincerely and earnestly than Archie Bunker & tribe. In fact, the landmark series, which debuted in 1976 on ABC, quickly gained a following for its willingness to integrate controversy with a fairly typical upper-middle-class family. The Lawrences--headed by Sada Thompson as Kate and James Broderick (father of Matthew Broderick) as Doug--were close-knit but willing to face issues like infidelity, gay friends, alcoholism, divorce, and more--making it ground-breaking for primetime TV. The kids (divorcee Nancy, played in season 1 by Elayne Heilveil and replaced in season 2 by Meredith Baxter Birney; Willie, played by Gary Frank; and the heartbreakingly adorable Buddy, played by Kristy McNichol) knew they had mom and dad's support, even when the going got tough, and were there for each other when crises arose. And happily, the show's producers, which included Mike Nichols and Aaron Spelling, realized all this earnestness needed leavening with some humor. When Buddy is needling Willie for dance lessons so she can go to the Junior Jump with the babelicious Carl (\"Hey, the Strawberry Shakes are playing!\"), Willie balks. Then Buddy looks him square in the eye and says, \"I need a personal triumph, Willie.\" She shoots, she scores. The show, which won Emmys for both Thompson and McNichol, boasts stellar writing and believable situations, and is still compulsive watchable years later. The boxed set includes all 28 episodes of the first two seasons.--A.T.

{"description": "Thai-born martial artist Tony Jaa, whose gravity-defying stunts wowed American audiences inOng-Bak: The Thai Warrior, returns in an equally eye-popping stunt fest that should thrill all but the most jaded action fans. The very simple plot has the soft-spoken, mild-mannered Jaa as a young man from a rural community dispatched to Australia to recover a pair of sacred elephants. Once there, he discovered that a female crime boss (played by transgendered actor Jing Xing) is behind the missing pachyderms, and Jaa pulls out all the stops to recover the animals for his village. As inOng-Bak, the appeal ofThe Protectoris watching Jaa unleash his muay thai skills on a host of villainous types, and he gets several astonishing showcases in this film, most notably a nearly-unbroken take in which he dispatches some 50 goons as he makes his way up a four-story structure. Those looking for the depth of story or character found in the best of Hong Kong action cinema won't find it inThe Protector, but the rewards for action fans are plentiful and thoroughly entertaining. The two-disc Collector's Edition ofThe Protectorincludes a wealth of extras, most notably the original Thai version of the film (titledTom Yum Goong), which runs approximately 30 minutes longer than the American version. Commentary by martial arts writer and fan Bey Logan is featured on the American edit, along with a deleted scene, a featurette about Jaa with Logan and rapper/producer The RZA (who scored the American version and, for some reason, is described as a major force in bringing Asian entertainment to the States), making-of featurettes on both the English and Thai versions of the film (the latter features a subtitled Thai-language commentary track with Jaa, director Prachya Pinkaew, and stunt coordinator/mentor Panna Rittikrai), and three fair short films that were produced for a promotional tie-in contest.-- Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009VBTQY", "B002XTXGA2", "B004BZ5ADW", "B00JVQ7RCS", "B002DHACS8", "B005ZMBEXU", "B001L67A4G", "B003INBNXO", "B004326EV0", "B0085A9J18", "B004I1AGTC", "B000GFLKDU", "B003FXXNH6", "B003EVAG4C", "B000K7UC2Y", "B004U7MR0K", "B000ICLU7C", "B004H2CXBQ", "B004P8R9O8", "B00ATXIJOC", "B000K2UW06", "B003LN0NXC", "B001MEJY9G", "B0035V35P8", "B0016MJ6JC", "B000N4SHNK", "B005F96UGO", "B00HSJ2EMI", "B00GXFZOYI", "B004XQO8MS", "B004SIP88Y", "B002C6VMIY", "B00J5LXST0", "B003DVB7F0", "B000A2IPQY", "B00B6OEE7O", "B006C1S1DY", "B002FU8JTW", "B0018PH3NS", "B00284G2BC", "B004U7MR1O", "B000MM0LEG", "B000V6I7N0", "B005E7SEZW", "B004GJYRKA", "B00FLCYIAA", "B001EI5C5U", "B009VL2A5M", "B001U0HB5Q", "B0054EKDEU", "B000HC2M3Y", "B00AWHDEIQ", "B0030A6ICG", "B00ET2ODYY", "B001MEJY9Q", "B00JVQ7PS4", "B000UVV2AG", "B004VW4V9E", "B00005YUNV", "B00ENTX7JU", "B00008EY6M", "B00J5LXTUI", "B0056OZI0M", "B005F96UHI", "B004SIPAP0", "B0085A9HXS", "B00C3ALL9O", "B006JD48GY", "B0019F02U8", "B00369ERCY", "B000K2V7DW", "B000EE3FUY", "B005KK2FWG", "B004TFTE9A", "B00003CXR4", "B00G3HOJZ6", "B002XTBE5Q", "B0009S2T0M", "B003YOZNFQ", "B003M9ZABU", "B000FKO5QK", "B0010X740K", "B00EI3Y1QO", "B0051SFTGQ", "B001QB9H1U", "B00FEHCQEC", "B00005OOQ1", "B000MM0LE6", "B000P6R9N0", "B008XEZXES", "B001BEK8HO", "B00003CY5A", "B000QGEB12", "0767819640", "B00HI9QGWC", "B0013D8LCM", "B0010X741O", "B0019PL2W0"], "bought_together": ["B002XTXGA2", "B0009VBTQY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0085A9J18", "B00J5LXST0", "3918810143", "B004I1AGTC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15313}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.1, "brand": "Weinstein Company", "asin": "B000I0RNWU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YIZWM7HuL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Protector (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "Pundits often make parallels between America's involvement in Iraq and the nightmare that was Vietnam; director-writer-producer David Zeiger'sSir! No Sir!does it too. But while the comparisons are generally apt (both conflicts are known as \"quagmires,\" became hugely unpopular with the public, and inflicted serious political damage on the presidents who presided over them), this documentary makes a vital distinction: namely, that some of the most vocal and active opponents of the Vietnam War were the very soldiers who fought in it. These are haunted men who went to Southeast Asia because it was their duty, perhaps even because they saw it as the right thing to do, only to become sorely disillusioned when they witnessed the horrible injuries, the villages bombed for little or no reason, the civilians tortured and killed, and various other horrors that took place \"in country.\" Some, like the so-called Nine for Peace, formed GI protest groups while still on active duty in Vietnam; some went AWOL (there were reportedly 500,000 incidents of desertion); a great many, including soldiers who refused to be deployed to 'Nam at all, were court-martialed and imprisoned in military stockades like San Francisco's Presidio, while still others returned home, joined movements like Vietnam Veterans Against the War, and published virulent underground newspapers. All of this is delivered via personal anecdotes, photos, and occasional file footage. The material is undoubtedly compelling, butSir! No Sir!pretty much makes its point in the first half hour, rendering the final hour somewhat tedious. And that's not even including the nearly two hours of accompanying bonus material. Most of the latter consists of extended interviews based on what we've already seen in the main program; there's also a look at theWinter Soldierinquiry (the subject of a separate documentary), as well as a joint appearance by \"Hanoi Jane\" Fonda, Vietnam's most infamous celebrity protester, and Cindy Sheehan, who became an anti-war activist after her son was killed in Iraq in 2004.--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000F3AILI", "B000A88ES2", "B00006673L", "B00329PYGQ", "B001HBVE7Y", "B00ARWXJ54", "B0000DI87X", "B003CP1SS8", "B00DPUB5LK", "B008MIYKLW", "0345311973", "B0001L3LUE", "0805086919", "B00CEJVNEM", "B00GYG8BKK", "B00006JMQC", "B008DHG9CA", "B000UX6TH0", "B0001LYFKO", "B000BKSITY", "0792841409", "1250045061", "0060929081", "B004AR4VRW", "B0000WN1N6", "B00AEFYTMQ", "B0015D20FE", "B0001WTUKS", "B00009V7S0", "B000GG4Y32", "B0031WNYHK", "B007AKGYJY", "B0001WTWOC", "B000059TFO", "B00007CVSP", "B000FBH3W2", "B001BSBC16", "B000ARXF7S", "B0042KZJIC", "B00AZMFG48", "B000OCY668", "B00026L9CU", "B00125WAWS", "B007AJXI2Q", "0814736351"], "bought_together": ["B000F3AILI", "B000A88ES2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00006673L", "B000F3AILI", "B000A88ES2", "B0014CKCEC"]}, "price": 16.86, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 104526}, "asin": "B000IB0DE4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517V2MNXS4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sir!

{"description": "Pile together a blue-ribbon cast, a screenplay high in quirkiness, and the Sundance stamp of approval, and youve got yourself a crossover indie hit. That formula worked for Little Miss Sunshine, a frequently hilarious study of family dysfunction. Meet the Hoovers, an Albuquerque clan riddled with depression, hostility, and the tattered remnants of the American Dream; despite their flakiness, they manage to pile into a VW van for a weekend trek to L.A. in order to get moppet daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) into the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. Much of the pleasure of this journey comes from watching some skillful comic actors doing their thing: Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette as the parents (hes hoping to become a self-help authority), Alan Arkin as a grandfather all too willing to give uproariously inappropriate advice to a sullen teenage grandson (Paul Dano), and a subdued Steve Carell as a jilted gay professor on the verge of suicide. The film is a crowd-pleaser, and if anything is a little too eager to bend itself in the direction of quirk-loving Sundance audiences; it can feel forced. But the breezy momentum and the ingenious actors help push the material over any bumps in the road. -- Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000YABYLA", "B00005JMJG", "B001UV4XGU", "B00A81MV3U", "B00DL46ZN8", "B00005JNC2", "B0007TKOAA", "B001UV4XUG", "B00005ALS0", "B00118T632", "B00AEFXESQ", "B007L6VR12", "B008220BA2", "B003L20ICE", "B0000640VJ", "B008OHV49W", "B001P9KR8U", "B000A7DVR2", "B00000F5MN", "B007L6VRBM", "B00AFEY354", "B0001GOH6Q", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00337KM2S", "B000H0MKOC", "B004UXUX4Q", "B0034G4OZE", "B00011CZRE", "B00275EGWY", "0205751989", "B000FVQLQQ", "B0010X8NF0", "B004SIP95G", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B004QL7KKC", "B00079Z9VO", "B00003CXZ4", "B0021L8UOY", "B001MM3AZM", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00606P0BM", "B00005Q4CS", "B00ADRYCWC", "B001TOD92C", "B004SEUIW4", "B000P0J0EW", "B0015OKWKI", "B000CS464G", "B0007PLLBU", "B00009W5CA", "B00005JLSB", "B004A8ZWV0", "B007RKFXUS", "B0010AN7Z4", "B00012QLB4", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B003UESJH4", "B00005JNBQ", "B007VYE4PK", "B000WZEZGI", "B00AEBB9F0", "6304907729", "B003Y5H574", "B000SFOW8I", "B00005JMJ4", "B001BL96K2", "B00006FMUW", "B002VPTJOA", "B00003CXO1", "B000J103OI", "B0038N9WKU", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00008975Z", "B003ASLJQI", "B0049985XW", "B003ASLJO0", "B001J9KJ4I", "B001FZQOW2", "B00000G02H", "1557047707", "B000BYRCQU", "B00121QGPY", "B00005JL57", "B000021Y77", "B000A3XY5A", "B000MZHW40", "B0000AC8LR", "B00AEFY0KW", "B0045HCJ9E", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B00AEBB9FA", "B00005A06N", "B000ELJAEM", "B00AEFYAMA", "B00E8RKHWW", "B00005JLRE", "B005LAIHE0", "B000M341QE", "B0039UT3LK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00118T632", "B00DL46ZN8", "B0007UC8Y4", "B001AGXEAG"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 401537}, "asin": "B000JU9OJ4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51T7A7BDBWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Little Miss Sunshine [Region 2]"}

{"description": "Much was written about Will Ferrell's first \"dramatic role\" as Harold Crick, an IRS auditor who begins hearing a voice narrating his life. ButStranger Than Fictionis hardly a drama. However, what Ferrell does--like Jim Carrey before him inThe Truman Show--is handle a toned-down character with genuineness and affection: you believe he is this guy. Crick leads a lonely life filled with numbers and routines. While at first he considers the voice a nuisance, Crick decides more action is needed when it speaks of \"his demise.\" Enter Professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), who takes on the absurd notion with revelry, trying to find out what kind of book Crick's life is leading. It turns out that the voice Crick is hearing belongs to Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson), a very real--and troubled--author who is writing a book in which Crick is a fictional character. As usual with these things, the stuffed shirt learns to live a better life--Crick even falls for one of his audits, a brash baker named Ana (Maggie Gyllenhaal). Marc Foster (Monster's Ball, Finding Neverland) has the right tone for the film, using great urban scenes (the unnamed city is Chicago) with interesting visualizations of Crick's world of numbers. He also directs Ferrell, Hoffman, and Gyllenhaal to their most charming performances (plus Linda Hunt and Tom Hulce pop up in two funny scenes). Ferrell succeeds in being a romantic lead you can root for; a scene where he eats Ana's freshly baked cookies is totally delightful without a hint of sarcasm. Screenwriter Zach Helm has two personal traits with his story: like Crick he followed his heart (he stopped rewriting scripts and only worked on his own) and like Eiffel, the final results are not a masterpiece, but good, and entertaining enough.

{"description": "Martin Scorsese makes a welcome return to the mean streets (of Boston, in this case) withThe Departed, hailed by many as Scorsese's best film sinceCasino. Since this crackling crime thriller is essentially a Scorsese-stamped remake of the acclaimed 2002 Hong Kong thrillerInfernal Affairs, the film was intensely scrutinized by devoted critics and cinephiles, and while Scorsese's intense filmmaking and all-star cast deserve ample acclaim,The Departedis also worthy of serious re-assessment, especially with regard to what some attentive viewers described as sloppy craftsmanship (!), notably in terms of mismatched shots and jagged continuity. But no matter where you fall on the Scorsese appreciation scale, there's no denying thatThe Departedis a signature piece of work from one of America's finest directors, designed for maximum impact with a breathtaking series of twists, turns, and violent surprises. It's an intricate cat-and-mouse game, but this time the cat and mouse are both moles: Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is an ambitious cop on the rise, planted in the Boston police force by criminal kingpin Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a hot-tempered police cadet who's been artificially disgraced and then planted into Costello's crime operation as a seemingly trustworthy soldier. As the multilayered plot unfolds (courtesy of a scorching adaptation byKingdom of Heavenscreenwriter William Monahan), Costigan and Sullivan conduct a volatile search for each other (they're essentially looking for \"themselves\") while simultaneously wooing the psychiatrist (Vera Farmiga) assigned to treat their crime-driven anxieties.Such convenient coincidences might sink a lesser film, butThe Departedis so electrifying that you barely notice the plot-holes. And while Nicholson's profane swagger is too much \"Jack\" and not enough \"Costello,\" he's still a joy to watch, especially in a film that's additionally energized by memorable (and frequently hilarious) supporting roles for Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg, and a host of other big-name performers.The Departedalso makes clever and plot-dependent use of cell-phones, to the extent that it couldn't exist without them. Powered by Scorsese's trademark use of well-chosen soundtrack songs (from vintage rock to Puccini's operas),The Departedmay not be perfect, but it's one helluva ride for moviegoers, proving popular enough to become the biggest box-office hit of Scorsese's commercially rocky career.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002ZG99N6", "B000P0J09M", "B004SIP7TE", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002ZG980U", "B002VWNIEA", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEBB8NI", "B002T9H2LA", "B00005JLSB", "B000MZHW40", "B00080ZG10", "B003ASLJQS", "B000P0J0AG", "B000P0J0EW", "B000C20VPA", "B003UESJHO", "B004SIP7ZS", "B003ASLJO0", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AHTYI5M", "B00275EGWY", "B000XR9L50", "B000A3XY5A", "B0007DFJ0G", "B001N44BVQ", "B00003CXWV", "B008MILL8W", "B000286RP2", "B004SIP7VM", "B00005V9HH", "6305313687", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004FQX5B6", "B00AEFXKUI", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEBB86A", "B005LAIIJY", "B0016Q2D66", "B003ASLJQI", "B00008975Z", "B000IY04Q8", "B001P9KR8U", "B00005JNJV", "B000C20VRS", "B008R65XYC", "B005LAIGRS", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00008DP4C", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00005JN0W", "B005LAIGLE", "B000A2UBN4", "B002QEHPQU", "B000P0J0EM", "B003UESJH4", "B007D5E7C2", "6304765258", "B000P0J0D8", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00004WG2F", "0767830555", "B000LC55F2", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B004EPYZP8", "B000A7DVR2", "B00005JPD0", "B000WZEZGI", "B00049QQHI", "B000FS9FCG", "B00004XPPB", "B006OFN0SE", "B009AMAL4Y", "B004U7MR14", "B000GFLKF8", "B003AWRMCE", "B0019L770A", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B0000AM6JI", "B004SIP9Z6", "B001GZ6QC4", "0783240295", "B0010DR4BO", "B000065U1N", "B00001ZWUS", "B00BB67UNW", "B0000B1OFL", "B00AEBB9K0", "B00DHDDE32", "B00005JKWX", "B0051MKNV8", "B002ZG97RE", "0767802519", "B0034G4P94", "B00DHHWXYY", "B00005B6JZ", "B00003CXZ4", "B001TODCII"], "bought_together": ["B000P0J09M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000RETOHY", "B000P0J09M", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEBB8NI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5067}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.5, "brand": "Warner Bros", "asin": "B000M341QE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RZnzpL34L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Not your typical star-studded or star-spangled war film, cult-fave director Samuel Fuller'sFixed Bayonetsis a viscerally thrilling  Korean War drama of one platoon's trial, and one corporal's baptism, under fire. Morale is high but the ammo is low for an American division hunkered down in the mountains of Korea. Certain massacre awaits if they retreat. To give \"15,000 men a break,\" 48 \"of our toughest combat men\" are selected to stay behind and trick the \"commies\" into thinking the entire division is in place while the others escape safely across a river.Fixed Bayonetsis raw and brutal in the best Fuller tradition. The backgrounds are obvious fakes, and the platoon members sport the usual war movie nicknames like Whitey, Rock, Jonesy, and \"Mr. Belvedere\" (he's the resident know-it-all). But all else has the authentic ring of reportage, as in a powerful scene when the men cluster together to rub their feet to ward off frostbite. Richard Basehart stars as Denno, who can \"take an order, but can't give one\" until his three superiors are knocked off one by one, leaving him in command. This rueful exchange--\"They told me this was going to be a police action.\" \"Why didn't they send the cops?\"--is as close as Fuller gets to geopolitics. For war-movie buffs, he does deliver pounding and tense action sequences. In one harrowing scene, a medic must navigate a minefield to try and rescue a wounded sergeant and retrieve the only map to the field.. But he is resolutely unsentimental and more interested in the ravaged, human face of war. These are faces you will not soon forget (one of them, reportedly, belongs to James Dean, but this film is so gripping, one is hard-pressed to make the effort to try to spot him).--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00CHYSSME", "0792841662", "B000NO1XJA", "B0015S2OWI", "B000NTPG66", "B000EHSVVO", "B000EHSVVE", "B00005PJ8K", "B00143XE0U", "B00096S4BM", "B0001NBMHQ", "B00H8J2NW4", "B00096S4B2", "B00005ASGB", "B0029778T8", "B00005OSJQ", "B000MGBLJG", "B005DIA0IQ", "B000QXDFS0", "B00HZOXRCC", "B00AEFXLKC", "B0007TKNLU", "B005HQBO9I", "B00C2535TE", "B007HCI42A", "B00005JN9P", "B000MGBLJ6", "B000EMGJFE", "B0007TKNDI", "B00008R9M6", "B000063URX", "B004VGHF7K", "B0001NBMGC", "B00008AOTO", "B000NTPG6Q", "B000E5N6KW", "B000H1RFSM", "B0008ENHU8", "B00005PJ8L", "B0085A9K62", "B00005B1YH", "B000EHSVV4", "B000MGBLIW", "B00KIZYDCI", "B000MRA542", "B0007TKNLA", "B00D3XMA9A", "B00005R23T", "B0002V8OAK", "B00BY0EBK0", "B0001FVDGE", "B000066C6H", "B005OTGS4E", "B00005B1YF", "B0001WTWWE", "B00008MTY1", "B003EYEEI8", "B0001NBMH6", "B002DNLT1Q", "B000063URW", "B000EHSVUK", "B0076XTIWU", "B005HQBO9S", "B000O78L0U", "B004R6EFAO", "B000A2WJBQ", "B004U7EIES", "B0001NBMI0", "B000062XEX", "B005DTZXMI", "B004GSVXBW", "B00008AOTR", "B00CZ7ALDM", "B00JX3SHIC", "B000E0WJN2", "B0005C9MQ6", "B00008PC0Z", "B004R6EF9U", "B003B3NV5E", "B0001FVDIC", "B004SJVQ4I", "B000NTPG5W", "B003GW94EM", "B008F0QBB4", "B0000AMRUP", "B00CHYSPJ0", "B004IFYMXO", "B00B27WRNI", "B005DKS1TE", "B00D3XM7H0", "0792841670", "B005H6RF8M", "B00KIZY3XW", "B00005N5S3", "B001PO55LE", "B004176JJY", "B00096S4DA", "B005MXQD4W", "B000EHSVSC", "B005L399BW"], "bought_together": ["B00CHYSSME"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00CHYSSME", "B007HCI42A", "B00C2535TE", "B0015S2OWI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 79174}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.44, "brand": "BASEHART,RICHARD", "asin": "B000MGBLIC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51s-tZY105L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fixed Bayonets"}
