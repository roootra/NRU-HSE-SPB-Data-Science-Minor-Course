{"description": "For all of its conventional plotting about an obsessive-compulsive curmudgeon (Jack Nicholson) who improves his personality at the urging of his gay neighbor (Greg Kinnear) and a waitress (Helen Hunt) who inspires his best behavior, this is one of the sharpest Hollywood comedies of the 1990s. Nicholson could play his role in his sleep (the Oscar he won should have gone to Robert Duvall forThe Apostle), but his mischievous persona is precisely necessary to give heart to his seemingly heartless character, who is of all things a successful romance novelist. As a single mom with a chronically asthmatic young son, Hunt gives the film its conscience and integrity (along with plenty of wry humor), and she also won an Oscar for her wonderful performance. Greg Kinnear had to settle for an Oscar nomination (while cowriter-director James L. Brooks was inexplicably snubbed by Oscar that year), but his work was also singled out in the film's near-unanimous chorus of critical praise. It's questionable whether a romance between Hunt and the much older Nicholson is entirely believable, but this movie's smart enough--and charmingly funny enough--to make it seem endearingly possible.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001AVZA8", "B000YAF4MA", "0800141741", "B004FQX5B6", "B0000YEEGM", "B0038N9WKU", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00AEBB9WI", "B00005JLSK", "0783226845", "B0000AOV4I", "B000YDBPAM", "B000XJD33O", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00081U7HC", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00003CXFV", "B001ECDVK4", "6305212112", "B000EHRVOW", "B00009Y3PV", "6304765266", "B00004RJ73", "B005F2JRUC", "0783225733", "B00AEFXYOA", "6305236569", "B000OCZA04", "B000FFJYBG", "B003ASLJK4", "0792833198", "B000JYW5B4", "B00012QLB4", "B00BTYRB3U", "B0043X1FL8", "B000055Y0Y", "B00005B6JZ", "B000EHQU0S", "B00AEBB9UK", "B00008G7UF", "B0002B15ZG", "B00005JG6N", "B001MBTTNA", "B001ECDVJU", "B00003CWQR", "B00AEFY4CG", "630471193X", "B002GHHHP6", "B00AEBB9NM", "B0000A02TZ", "0767821769", "B00569I5BQ", "B00AEFYSWM", "B00AEFXYJA", "B000XT1P3E", "B002GHHHGU", "B00026ZG10", "6305128952", "B00005OLYF", "B001LMAK9W", "B000N6U0E2", "B000EMGJ7C", "B000023VTP", "B00CPTUOI2", "B004SIP9U6", "B00001ZWUS", "B003BV8ICC", "B0043X1FM2", "B0013XZ2QK", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00AEBB9FA", "B007SPPANM", "B00005JM4Q", "B007N31YH0", "B000VECAD0", "B00003CXO1", "B00009WVSL", "B00003CXSM", "B000NA1WDQ", "B00004BZIY", "B002AS464Q", "B000J103OI", "B000021Y7L", "B000ENC5YW", "B0002V7ON8", "B00009W5CA", "B00015YVDG", "B0009X75O2", "B0000JBALO", "0767803434", "6305065551", "B000MQC9H4", "6305692572", "B00013RC2U", "6305144168", "B00008979G", "B000CCBCAS", "0792846443", "B000M341QE"], "bought_together": ["B0001AVZA8", "B000YAF4MA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001AVZA8", "B0038N9WKU", "B000YAF4MA", "B00013WWT8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5469}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.96, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "0767811100", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KRRMHSAJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "As Good As It Gets"}
{"description": "An obvious attempt to cash in on the success ofJaws, this 1977 thriller was also based on a bestseller by Peter Benchley, and it features a memorable performance by Robert Shaw (the doomed shark hunter inJaws) in one of the last roles of his career. Looking very tanned and healthy, Nick Nolte and Jacqueline Bisset play a young couple enjoying a tropical vacation who discover a glass ampoule while scuba diving off the coast of Bermuda. It takes a seasoned treasure hunter (Shaw) to identify the ampoule as part of a valuable shipment of World War II morphine lost at sea, coincidentally, atop the even greater treasure of a sunken Spanish galleon. Thus begins a race for drugs and treasure pitting Nolte, Bisset, and Shaw against a ruthless drug lord (Louis Gossett Jr.) who'll do anything--even resort to Haitian voodoo--to get what he wants. It's all rather contrived and exploitative (after all, the movie's best known for Bisset's wet T-shirt scuba-dive), but as escapist entertainment goes it's got some exciting highlights including a moray eel that attacks on cue and... well, uh, Jacqueline Bisset in a wet T-shirt.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004YMATCY", "B007STBUHI", "B00008G8LY", "B0012KJ0DK", "B00005NKSZ", "0792844017", "B00005A8XX", "B00979KQD6", "B00008WFU4", "0783230516", "B0062KMDGG", "B00AEFYSR2", "0553140531", "B00407PNY2", "B0030VANHQ", "B00153ZR8G", "B00018D3ZA", "B00005LQ0I", "B00AEFYEU8", "B000KGGIVY", "B00BGQ2P9G", "B000M53GNG", "B0045HCJKS", "B000P0J0BU", "B000E5N684", "B00J2G4ZAY", "B00005JKU0", "B003ASLJRC", "B0001FGC1U", "B001RP974M", "B00005N5S3", "B00008WFU5", "B000EHSVNW", "B00005QCVP", "B000M69SJG", "B005ETALYW", "0767802497", "0790731932", "B00AEFYBA6", "B00LC4PCVU", "079073639X", "B000NQRR1G", "0767802470", "B0045HCJ8A", "B003ASLJPE", "B000MGTQ7U", "B006XMK11W", "6305213283", "B0008ENHTY", "0792838408", "B00008K76U", "B00CPTUOI2", "B0079ZWUCA", "B0007O38ZS", "B0013LL2Z2"], "bought_together": ["B007STBUHI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004TDTO", "B00005A8XX", "B00153ZR8G", "B000BYRCGU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 80595}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.75, "brand": "BISSET,JACQUELINE", "asin": "0767818067", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51D-CGOvhTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Deep"}

{"description": "Upon its release in 1948,Drunken Angelwas hailed in Japan as  Akira Kurosawa's directorial breakthrough, comparable to Kubrick'sPaths of Gloryin the way it catapulted Kurosawa into a higher level of artistic achievement. Kurosawa himself noted, \"In this picture I was finally myself. It wasmypicture. I was doing it and nobody else.\"It is indeed an important, vital film, confidently conceived and expertly executed, illuminating themes that would dominate the finest films in Kurosawa's exceptional career. The setting is a rancid, jerry-built section of a postwar city, where a filthy, disease-ridden pond functions as a physical threat and also as the film's central symbol of decay. It's in this hardscrabble environment that a brash young gangster (Toshiro Mifune, in the role that made him a star) visits an alcoholic doctor (Takashi Shimura) to have a bullet removed from his hand. The doctor discovers that the hot-tempered thug is also doomed by tuberculosis, seen here as the physical manifestation of the gangster's moral decay. The doctor is himself diseased by his drinking, and as these clashing men struggle to make some kind of difference in their pathetic lives (spurned by the return from prison of a ruthless yakuza boss), Kurosawa makes unlikely heroes of them both--men who undergo a personal transformation in a vile and violent world.Drunken Angelis a transitional film for Japanese cinema and especially for Kurosawa; it offers a vivid glimpse of postwar life (both rotten and restoring), and signals the full blossoming of Kurosawa's talent. And while the title role belongs to Shimura (so memorably poignant in Kurosawa's later masterpiece,Ikiru), the film belongs to the forceful presence of Mifune, whose vitality touches nearly every scene of this timeless and powerful drama.--Jeff Shannon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 438258}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0780023447", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EYZ5MNGQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Drunken Angel [VHS]"}
{"description": "The premise sounds great but the promise is never fulfilled. Terrence McNally's Tony Award-winning hit about a cluster of gay male friends who gather several times one summer at a Victorian house on the bank of a rural lake never quite measures up (at least on film) as anything particularly profound. The story traces a history of infighting and changing relationships within the group, with the shock of AIDS slowly pushing everyone toward greater closeness and honesty. But instead of making an impact, so much of the film is trivial: dinner conversations are banal, tantrums are tedious, genitals are a little too overexposed. The two best and most familiar actors in the piece, Jason Alexander and John Glover, ironically play the most clich&eacute;-ridden characters. Still, Glover--who portrays British twin brothers who could not be more different from one another--is a very good reason to see this film.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00079HZTS", "B006FYYWQS"]}, "price": 5.44, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 346345}, "asin": "0780620372", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/715S948ANJL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Love Valour Compassion [VHS]"}
{"description": "Not only was Barry Levinson's comedy shot in a relatively fast period of 29 days, the satire of politics and show business feels as if it were made yesterday. There's a fresh spin quite evident here, a nervy satire of a presidential crisis and the people who whitewash the facts. The main players are a mysterious Mr. Fix-It (Robert De Niro), veteran Hollywood producer (Dustin Hoffman), and a White House aide (Anne Heche). Can the president's molesting of a young girl be buried in the two weeks before an election? A war in Albania just might do the trick. In the good old days, the president would just invade. With modern technology, it's even cleaner. The hungry press looks for any lead, convenient misinformation is created by the latest Hollywood fakery (\"all developed by the new James Cameron film\") creating images and merchandise all instantly packaged. And it must be real, because it's on TV. David Mamet's script never questions the morals or the absolute secrecy needed to pull this thing off. He and director Barry Levinson have enough truth in the story to make you wonder what is real news and what is just promotion the next time you see CNN. Many of the supporting players impact the story with mere presence: Denis Leary as a quote man, Willie Nelson as a songwriter. The three leads are magnificent. With the similarities between history and this film,Wagwill forever linked to the Monica Lewinsky saga. This video version contains a new minidocumentary focusing on the parallels of the film with the Bill Clinton scandal, including comments from director Barry Levinson and hosted by newsman Tom Brokaw.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783227973", "6305297142", "B000H0MKOC", "B000CNESU8", "B00005OOQ2", "B0013XZ2QK", "B001MVWFAO", "B001TH92N4", "B000CEXEWA", "B001AMHNKW", "B000E1NXJ0", "B006ML50QK", "B00003CXP7", "B00000IPG4", "B0000WN0SC", "B000MXPE7O", "B000055Y0X", "6305428522", "B00003CWRX", "B00DDY45DI", "B007KAUWO2", "6305428115", "B00007G1YQ", "B00005BCK9", "B0060ZJ7DA", "B000YQT7QI", "B00AEBB9SM", "B00005J75F", "0790731460", "B004UOHNAC", "B004GJYRKK", "B00000IQC0", "6305161879", "B000BITV92", "B000CNESTE", "B00020X88Y", "B000LC5B7O", "B0007TKNF6", "B001IHJ988", "B00022XE6S", "B001GLX6UI", "B002AS464Q", "B0007R4T3U", "B000P0J0AQ", "B007UW9W5U", "B003UESJEM", "B00441GYOM", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00AZNEW5G", "B00005JMET", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B003O7I6SE", "B000F7CMRM", "B000P0J0AG", "B0001907AI", "B0000YEEGM", "B0033AI4CK", "B00005UQ9T", "B00000JGPE", "B004FQX59I", "0792833287", "B0006210ZG", "B003N9ASF2", "B003ASLJIQ", "B002NZK5UU", "B001DE29SI", "6304696507", "0780631536", "B00003CX8U", "6305781095", "0767811100", "B00AEBB8LA", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00AEFXN9G", "B000C3L2IO", "B0034G4P7G", "B00005JKBC", "B0041KKYBA", "0783219571", "B000ZM1MG4", "0790732238", "B000P0J0BK", "B00014NEZI", "B00005MEOU", "B000H5TH20", "B00AEFYR3C", "B00003CXRM", "B0001GH7VS", "B001AQO3RO", "B00AW8OZ88", "B003ASLJQ8", "B00006RCNV", "B00029LNYQ", "B0001EFV7C", "B004FQX5B6", "B000244GCW", "0792833279", "B0008ENHUI", "B002GOAGZC", "B000P0J0EW"], "bought_together": ["0783227973", "6305297142"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004GJYRKK", "0783227973", "B000H0MKOC", "B002VWNICC"]}, "price": 5.97, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18193}, "asin": "0780622561", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51arIQeW%2BlL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wag the Dog (New Line Platinum Series)"}

{"description": "The original title ofLiving Out LoudwasThe Kiss, which  also happens to be the title of one of the two Anton Chekhov stories the movie is loosely based on. (For those Russian lit mavens out there, the other story is \"Misery.\") The actual kiss inLiving Out Loudis a somewhat mysterious affair:  newly single Judith (Holly Hunter) suddenly finds herself laying a wet 'n' sloppy one on a total stranger (Elias Koteas, Hunter'sCrashcostar) in the back room of a cool jazz club, and then parting ways with the man. For good. Like so much of this exceptionally smart, generous movie, no explanation is given--or necessary. Screenwriter Richard LaGravenese (The Fisher King), making his directing debut, charts Judith's struggles in the wake of being dumped by her doctor husband (Martin Donovan). It turns out life has its ups and downs, some of which come courtesy of the elevator operator (Danny DeVito) in her swanky Upper East Side apartment building. DeVito's character is a nice guy in need of a little human touch, and the actor soft-pedals his usual sleaze in favor of a warm, directly emotional approach. It's the kind of turn that garners Oscar nominations, except that this movie didn't attract the box office it deserved. His performance, like the film, keeps surprising you--a fantasy sequence here, an ensemble dance there, plus a couple of smoky jazz tunes contributed by Queen Latifah. This unpredictable movie has the kiss of class.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000FCBB", "B0003JAO7C", "B0001US84Y", "B00005LOKR", "0767821432", "B00GC2KHV2", "B00000IQW5", "B000R17RQM", "B00008G7UL", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B0002XL1XU", "B000S9JS4M", "B000059XTI", "B00006CXI7", "B000OPOANO", "B002NZK5RI", "B0013D8LKO", "B005XB8T68", "B00FZ4KR4U", "0767821009", "B001IHJ988", "B0064MT1FI", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00000K3CS", "B00005JN4H", "B005Z9MGRG", "B00002E20R", "B000OVLC0W", "B00005JKIS", "B00007G1YP", "B00005KA73", "B00004RFAK", "B005ZVIPG0", "B00DW5IKYS", "B0077PBPTG", "B008CRC506", "B000U1ZV76", "B004SIP9VA", "B00A429YF6", "B0000C3I99", "B0017ANAZO", "B00EV4EUT8", "B009R8Q8Y8", "B00008AOVL", "B00005JLSK", "B000040OJ6", "B0037QGS0A", "0767827902", "B004SIP8WU", "0783229364", "6305327068", "B00008L3S9", "630523650X", "B00BTYRB58", "B00AEBB9DW"], "bought_together": ["B00000FCBB"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00000FCBB", "B0003JAO7C", "B00000IQW5", "B000S9JS4M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 96694}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 33.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0780625358", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YDM2XVPEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Living Out Loud"}

{"description": "There are two versions of the 1995 space adventure on this 10th anniversary DVD set, but it's not what you think. The IMAX edition that played in theaters in 2002 isshorterthan the original cut, so there is no new footage. The first major Hollywood film to be reprocessed for viewing on these massive screens,Apollo 13was shortened by 24 minutes so it could be loaded onto the gigantic reels in the IMAX theaters. The new cut delivers a mostly space-centered film; much of the domestic scenes (featuring Kathleen Quinlan's Oscar-nominated performance) are gone, which may help young space cadets get into the film. The IMAX print is also less wide than the theatrical version (1.66:1 versus 2.35:1) and delivers a DTS soundtrack not found on the theatrical version. Both prints are remastered and look grand.

{"description": "Let's be honest: this 1995 epic isn't nearly as bad as its negative publicity led us to expect. At the time it was the most expensive Hollywood production in history (it had aTitanic-sized $200 million budget), and the film arrived in theaters with so much controversy and negative gossip that it was an easy target for ridicule. The movie itself, a flawed but enjoyable post-apocalypse thriller, deserves better.Waterworldstars Kevin Costner as the Mariner, a lone maverick with gills and webbed feet who navigates the endless seas of Earth after the complete melting of the polar ice caps. The Mariner has been caged like a criminal when he's freed by Helen (Jeanne Tripplehorn) and enlisted to help her and a young girl (Tina Majorino) escape from the Smokers, a group of renegade terrorists led by Dennis Hopper in yet another memorably villainous role. It is too bad the predictable script isn't more intelligent, but as a companion piece toThe Road Warrior, this seafaring stunt-fest is adequately impressive.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002GHHHHO", "B00B83ROIE", "B004AOECXI", "B002VWNID6", "B000NA1WGS", "0790731932", "0767817729", "B003AWRM9M", "B0045HCJT4", "B00005R2IS", "B0006GANOQ", "B00004Y87O", "1558908846", "B000E5N6LG", "6301971345", "0792844874", "B001ILFUBE", "B0000TANUI", "B000QUCRB4", "B0038RSJB4", "B00AEFYDM2", "B003XURDAY", "B002O3Z50G", "B000KF0GWW", "0800141687", "B00000G3PA", "0780622650", "B0045HCJKS", "0800195175", "B00004STDN", "B0006N2EZ0", "B002QW7ALM", "B002NZK5Q4", "0783233507", "B0002V7OI8", "0767817710", "B00003CXIV", "078324021X", "B00AEBB9NM", "B002U4UYYQ", "0783225520", "B0068FZ0GK", "B0045HCJGC", "B0045HCJRG", "B000EHSVPK", "B00AEFXPSK", "B002GIBVVG", "B000AMPPOO", "6304711905", "B00AEFXKUI", "B00070FX5U", "1558908315", "B00003CWU3", "B00008G8M4", "B00008G8LY", "6304711891", "B00A8MGIZG", "0783225547", "B000P0J0C4", "B002O3Z510", "B00005N5S5", "B0000844I8", "B00004Z4WR", "6305213283", "B008JFUN50", "B00006JDVV", "B00008O38G", "B00000IQC4", "B00IZZDWKM", "079283366X", "6304806434", "630529142X", "B0010YSD8Q", "B00AEFXPG2", "B00004XPPG", "B00005JMOW", "B001FB5634", "B00JA3RVG4", "B000AM6OQ2", "B002AT8KD8", "6305173966", "B00005JKZH", "B000JYW5BE", "0767817478", "B00E8G5HZ0", "B0045HCJ9O", "B006VRRGNK", "B00BTYNXJG", "B000NOKFHQ", "B00005O439", "0790750201", "B00ALTQRRK", "B002NZK5VO", "B00005JNP4", "B000U1ZV62", "0783225733", "155890834X", "B00026ZG10", "B004LB5FDG", "B003Q6D2B4"], "bought_together": ["B002GHHHHO", "B004AOECXI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004AOECXI", "B002VWNID6", "B002GHHHHO", "B000NA1WGS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 96454}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0783219857", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516XHNYKADL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Waterworld"}

{"description": "When attorney Julie Hastings (Frances McDormand) uncovers corrupt city real estate dealings, evil thugs attack her scientist boyfriend, Peyton Westlake (Liam Neeson). Left for dead after his lab is detonated, he miraculously survives when the ensuing blast hurls him into the nearby harbor. Treated as a John Doe at a city hospital, he is unknowingly submitted to radical therapy which numbs his nerves to feeling--but which heightens his strength and his emotions. Once conscious, Peyton escapes from the hospital and builds a ramshackle lab in an abandoned industrial plant. Horribly burned and scarred by the lab explosion, he uses synthetic skin to impersonate his would-be murderers and seek retribution for their evil deeds. Peyton also tries to reunite with Julie, who believes him to be dead. While the film has an average script, it is overcome by the flashy cinematography of Bill Pope, the bombastic score by Danny Elfman, and the well-choreographed direction of Sam Raimi. The director confidently walks the line between suspense, action, comedy, and romance as he examines a bitter, victimized antihero who risks becoming as monstrous on the inside as he appears on the outside.--Bryan Reesman", "related": {"also_bought": ["078323046X", "078321958X", "B0003JANT6", "B00BTYMPUY", "B0007PALZ2", "B003498SCQ", "078322799X", "B0009X768W", "B00005N7Z1", "B0002J58HO", "6305428514", "B00003CXQA", "B002AS466O", "B0009PVZD2", "B005LAIIRQ", "B001R3YRG2", "B0009X76XC", "B004A8ZX28", "B0015XHQT4", "B00AEFXCLU", "B0085A9HU6", "B000RW3VCK", "B00005JLWN", "B00007AJG4", "B00005K3NR", "0783225520", "B001F7MSFM", "079284646X", "B00008L3UM", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B0000A9GHD", "1558908846", "B00004Y87O", "B00FQPLZ08", "B000OVLBHG", "B001J710Y8", "0767802454", "B0001Z37HM", "0783227434", "0783229402", "B00026ZG10", "B00008G8LY", "6304698747", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000PMFRZQ", "B0045HCJGC", "0767821629", "0767817710", "B000NOIVT0", "B001JFZ118", "B001B43IVW", "B00005JKWJ", "B00005N5RM", "B000068IEV", "B0045HCJG2", "0783223609", "B0007PALGG", "B0024FADD8", "078401132X", "6304723113", "B0001VTPW2", "B00000ILDD", "6305767866", "079283366X", "B001TODCII", "B00005M2CO", "B00J2PQYYK", "B0067EKYAY", "B000FFJYAC", "B00BPEJWAE", "B002GHHHG0", "B002ZG994U", "B0007V6ITE", "B000MV8ABS", "B000NIBURQ", "B0040J1RX6", "B00001O2H0", "B004BZ5AN2", "0767815718", "B00003CXKA", "B003XURDAY", "0767811097", "B0002KVUKM", "B007ZC31R0", "B009AMAJPA", "0783226934", "B001FZQOW2", "B008G33PIM", "B0000UJL96", "B00004XMSC", "B00441GYZG", "B00DW5IKW0", "B003AWRM9W", "B00441GYXS", "B000031EG1", "0790729342", "B000NO1XJA", "B0090EDEM8", "B00007AJGH", "B003UGLCIA"], "bought_together": ["078323046X", "B0003JANT6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000PFUAP0", "078321958X", "6305841985", "B00GHH9IIA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 56997}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.86, "brand": "Universal", "asin": "0783226012", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B63F94CML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Darkman"}

Oscar winner Emma Thompson co-stars in this gripping film the Los Angeles Times calls, \"A politically charged 'Fugitive.'\" In the Name of the Father tells the true saga of Gerry Conlon.  A petty thief in strife-torn '70s Belfast, Gerry's main interests are getting drunk and partying, much to the dismay of his quiet, frail father Giuseppe (Pete Postlethwaite). When Gerry angers the IRA, his father sends him to England, where his antics land him in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Innocent, but forced to confess to a savage terrorist bombing, he is sentenced to life imprisonment as one of the \"Guildford Four.\"  An innocent Giuseppe is also arrested and jailed, and while behind bars, Gerry slowly learns that his father's seeming weakness masks an unmatched inner strength and wisdom. Working with a fiercely dedicated lawyer (Thompson), Gerry determines to prove his innocence, clear his father's name and expose the truth behind one of the most shameful legal events in recent history.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783227329", "B004U7MR1Y", "B000OCY7JO", "0790729407", "B00005V1WP", "B004TPJN9Q", "B007UW9W5U", "B003498SCQ", "B00008DDHZ", "B0009VRHNI", "B004499LWG", "B000005IQX", "B00013F2S6", "B004XVMCQ2", "B0009G3BCY", "B00B5A9FL4", "B000CBG5PG", "B0002V7SOS", "B00007K02D", "B004SIP7TE", "B000AQKV1C", "B00000ILEC", "0452272785", "0767833600", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00005JLR8", "B00000F3FS", "0767802578", "B00008R9KF", "B00004TJKJ", "B000CBG5PQ", "B000A2WP7O", "B002YMWPUA", "B000EHSVQO", "B000189LE2", "B001FB55OE", "B009YX8MSG", "B00078XGRY", "B001ADXX1E", "B000056BP3", "B005WAP2V0", "0783231202", "B00004W5U6", "B005SH65G8", "B003LL3FIY", "0800141806", "B00B5A9FP0", "B000X1Z0BU", "B00004TJKI", "B00DMDSC4S", "B00J5G1P2W", "B00J5LXT44", "087113702X", "B00009W5CA", "B000063US3", "B00441GYPG", "B0006Z2NAY", "B006TTC5HC", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B004IY6A0S", "B00IBKXQJS", "B000KX0IOA", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00CX7OWWA", "B00003CXC9", "B00005MEOU", "B0064MT1FI", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00K6D1QV8", "B0001DCYUU", "B0002V7ON8", "B000JYW5AK", "B0007PALZ2", "B002VWNICC", "B0002CR04A", "B0000714BW", "B00005B6JZ", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B000EHRVOM", "B009AMANBA", "B006FE83UE", "B002LYD2MG", "B0049BKOIY", "6304696515", "630542828X", "B0045HCJ8K", "B000LPR6GA", "B004FQX59I", "B000GG4Y32", "B00G15MDI0", "B00005JKG9", "B000H5TH20", "0767812158", "B00AEFXBPM", "B0057ZAA6W", "B001AMH7XA", "B004SUDQ72", "B000059TFO", "B00008DDVT", "0784011710"], "bought_together": ["B004U7MR1Y", "0783227329"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0790729407", "B000OCY7JO", "B004U7MR1Y", "B000005IQX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17197}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.95, "brand": "LEWIS,DANIEL DAY", "asin": "0783227906", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2BVccNfwrL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "In the Name of the Father"}
{"description": "A phenomenal hit when it was released in 1989,Field of Dreamshas become a modern classic and a uniquely American slice of cinema. It functions effectively as a moving drama about the power of dreams, a fantasy ode to our national pastime, and a brilliant adaptation of W.P. Kinsella's exquisite baseball novelShoeless Joe. Kinsella himself found the film a delightful surprise, differing greatly from his novel but benefiting from its own creative variations. It is the film that cemented Kevin Costner's status as an all-American screen star, but the story resonates far beyond Costner's handsome appeal. As just about everyone knows by now, Costner stars as Iowa farmer Ray Kinsella, who hears the mysterious words &quot;If you build it, he will come,&quot; and is compelled to build a baseball diamond in the middle of his cornfield. His wife (Amy Madigan) supports the wild idea, but a reclusive novelist (modeled after J.D. Salinger and played by James Earl Jones) is not so easily persuaded. The idealistic farmer is either a visionary or a deluded fool, but his persistence is rewarded when spirits from baseball's past begin appearing on the ball field. Past and present intermingle in the person of &quot;Moonlight Graham&quot; (superbly played by Burt Lancaster), an unknown player who sacrificed his dreams of baseball glory for a dignified life as a small-town physician ... but what all of this means is unclear until the film's memorably heartfelt conclusion. A meditation on family, memory, and faith, the film balances humor and magic to strike just the right chord of thoughtful emotion, affecting audiences so deeply that the baseball field created for the production has now become a mecca of sorts for dreamers around the world.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000MNOX94", "B000068NNU", "078324021X", "0800177258", "B0010YSD90", "B00005M20J", "B0000633U2", "B004X2TYG2", "B009NNM9OA", "B00AEFXHNI", "B00009AOAX", "B00028HBES", "0792843592", "B0060ZJ7BC", "B0007LLPXI", "B00004W221", "B005SQRYEG", "B0012YYZDG", "B000FOPPDI", "B00AATUZLU", "0996057102", "B0036APHRC", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00DW5IKW0", "B004AOECXI", "B0001US66Y", "B000G0O5I2", "B009POCG2C", "B000056VP4", "B00DNF1SSC", "B0000004XN", "B000ND91WC", "B001LMAK9W", "B0002WZTOI", "B000069I1K", "0783225733", "B007N31YH0", "B002NZK5TQ", "B000A0GXRO", "B000FO0AA6", "B000P0J09W", "B00AMSQBP8", "B002VECM6S", "0395957737", "B002GHHHNI", "B003ASLJK4", "B00F3LSXPA", "B001KRCDT8", "B001LXIDVI", "6305144168", "B000YDBPAM", "B004FQX5A2", "B007SPPANM", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00158K0QU", "B00AEFXXMI", "B006FE83UE", "B000JYW5B4", "B00003CXC3", "B002VWNIBI", "B000J3OTT6", "B002O3Z50G", "B003VE9WTW", "B0087F7VSY", "B004GJYRF0", "B0006GAO5Y", "B00004TJQJ", "B00009AOAW", "B002E01LOI", "B0000AOV4I", "B0007LLPWO", "B000P0J0BK", "B000CEXEWA", "B000683VI4"], "bought_together": ["B000MNOX94", "0800177258"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000MNOX94", "078324021X", "B00005M20J", "B00028HBES"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 56402}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.35, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "0783225881", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51OpjWdidLL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Field of Dreams (Widescreen Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "The human beings are almost as interesting as the title character in  this surprisingly subtle and engaging film about the cross-country adventures of a smart-mouthed parrot. As director John Roberts deploys the footage, the bird becomes a vivid personality; every quizzical twist of his head is oddly expressive. The people who interact with Paulie are a quirky and interesting bunch as well, and the casting is topnotch: Tony Shalhoub (The Siege) as a Russian immigrant janitor, Cheech Marin as an open-hearted mariachi musician, and Gena Rowlands as a widowed painter in a footloose Winnebago--all are vividly eccentric individuals, memorable in their own right. There are some tired swipes at the cold-blooded meanies of Big Science (beady-eyed researcher Bruce Davison has Paulie clapped in irons), but for the most part the film respects the complexity of everyone's motivations, and that's virtually unheard of in today's Hollywood, even in films supposedly designed for grownups.--David Chute", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFYO08", "B00AKGG6E8", "6305320950", "B000BB1534", "B0009NZ2XS", "B000EOMB9U", "B000HT389E", "B004P7CN0O", "B0000696HZ", "0783111509", "B00BTYSIWI", "6304711913", "B0000VCZKW", "B00005LK94", "B0000AK7AB", "B000Y11B7G", "B0000CBXZU", "B000068QPM", "B008R65XKG", "B00AEFY8FO", "B0000VV512", "B000053VAG", "B00005JG6M", "B00008L3U1", "6304711867", "B000VAHQWY", "0783232292", "6305236569", "B000056H2B", "B00003CXG7", "B000089779", "B00000JL8E", "B00004Z1GR", "B0000633U3", "B000068QPT", "B00DW5IM5K", "B00H5NY7O0", "B002GHHHOC", "B00467QGU6", "B00008977A", "B00BG92NPO", "6305308888", "B0000DZTNB", "B00007ELEM", "6304604564", "B0007LXPBI", "B003PIUIHE", "B002O3Z50G", "0764127837", "B0006J28MI", "B000085EF5", "B00JK531ES", "B0015RRNN4", "B000A2WARE", "B004HO6I4M", "B001CW8016", "B00006AW63", "B0007Z0NYG", "B00005JKVU", "B00002SSKH", "B001O5LVPI", "0061673986", "B006G89C5O", "B00365QS8E", "B001LMAK9C", "B000031EGV", "0783231474", "B005TK0MFE", "B00008979B", "B000FFJYB6", "B002GHHHNI", "B000065V42", "B00000JGOQ", "0792833759", "B000B6CO4I", "B000H6SY6O", "B0084IHVUC", "B000209KMW", "0783225547", "B000059XV6", "B0002B14UW", "0764136674", "B000P0J0CO", "B00F1BFSI2", "140008170X", "B000Y11B7Q", "B003VE9WTW", "B0087F7VSY", "B00000IQW5", "B000ION23A", "B000QUU4LY", "B00063KGPU", "B000089771", "B0019ESNGE", "0783227396", "B001132GNY", "B008R65XPQ"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFYO08"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFYO08", "B000BB1534", "B00AKGG6E8", "B000P0J09W"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 36175}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.94, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "0783231210", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518JF5GBCSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Paulie"}

{"description": "Arnold Schwarzenegger as a pregnant man? The Terminator with cramps and morning sickness? That was  all the teasing audiences needed to flock to this 1994 farce, which reunited Arnold with his director and costar fromTwins, Ivan Reitman and Danny De&nbsp;Vito. Reitman had also directed the Austrian muscleman inKindergarten Cop, and they brought the same breezy quality of those earlier films to this enjoyable fluff, in  which Arnold plays a scientist who uses his own body to test a revolutionary new fertility drug. His colleague De Vito  talks him into the experiment, which succeeds beyond their wildest expectations when Arnold begins a full-term  pregnancy. Emma Thompson offers a wealth of comedic support as the biologist who moves into Schwarzenegger's lab  while he's coping with his \"maternal\" condition, and Pamela Reed (who was also inKindergarten Cop) adds to  the fun as De&nbsp;Vito's pregnant ex-wife. What's surprising about this mainstream hit is not that it makes the most of  its absurd premise, but that it's also sweetly heartwarming in its treatment of role reversal and the joys and pains of  pregnancy. It's a good-natured vehicle for a different side of Schwarzenegger's star appeal, and the fact that it works at  all is a tribute to Reitman and his cleverly talented cast.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783226926", "0783225504", "B00005T7I2", "B0002J58HO", "6305767866", "B000056PMU", "B00013RC8E", "0767804309", "B000TJBN6W", "B00005T7I3", "B00004XMSC", "B00026ZG10", "B005XB8SRS", "B0001Z37HM", "B000068QPM", "B002GHHHME", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B000Y11B7Q", "B00005JKIP", "0783225946", "B001LMAK9C", "B00AKGG828", "6305803781", "B0000VD12I", "B00005T7HZ", "B000RJO56E", "B00008979F", "B000RW3VCK", "B00005N5S5", "B00000IQW2", "B00008977A", "B00070FX5U", "B000089771", "B00JVLGL2A", "B00AEFXPG2", "B0087ZG7NO", "B0000542C9", "B000063INF", "B00K8HALVI", "0767802497", "B00AMEZDN8", "B0000VV5BM", "0783241895", "B00386EZKE", "B00K8HAKSW", "0800177029", "B00018YC3M", "B00008L3S9", "B001VLBDD0", "B00HSSZKAW", "6305236569", "0783235070", "6305213305", "B008KEQMDC", "B000QQLVPQ", "B001OST0M6", "B000FC2FQA", "B00081U7HC", "1558908404", "B00020HAXI", "B00006AW63", "B00AEBB9WI", "B0006J28MI", "6305428395", "B00441GYQ0", "B00HLTD49C", "B002XUBDRY", "B00HQOFAKI", "B000E6ESI0", "0767807588", "0783226896", "B000TZJBPQ", "B0006GANOQ", "0783227396", "B00441GYY2", "B000IJ79X4", "B001G7Q0M8", "0767821769", "B000BUE5E6", "B001TK80C0", "B00BTYJYP8", "B001L2ZSJO", "B00008L3U1", "B007R915RE", "B0007GGYUC", "B001CQONNG", "B004X1M47O", "6305428549", "B0000DKDUV", "B000065V43", "B0009UZG3C", "B00009AOBM", "B004X1M3DE", "B000068MC1", "B000BPL2FQ", "0792844866", "B00008G8LY", "B00H1RMWYW", "B003UESJEW", "B002LFAHBE"], "bought_together": ["0783226926", "0783225504"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000RJO56E", "0783225504", "0783226926", "0800177975"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 46614}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "UNIVERSAL", "asin": "0783230370", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VBRQ7VGVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Junior"}
{"description": "Here's the pitch: \"It's likeToy Storybut these toys that come to life really kick butt!\" That's essentially it for this breezy popcorn flick. In a very smart first 10 minutes, new toy-company owner Denis Leary tells his crew he wants toys \"that play back.\" Hence the small soldiers land in Anytown, U.S.A., and the loner kid Alan (Gregory Smith) opens them up before they are supposed to be on the shelves. Those military-grade chips sure make them smart and give the toys plenty of pithy retorts to boot. Plenty of violence, er, action, most of it fun enough. The vocal talents, including Tommy Lee Jones, Frank Langella, and cast members ofThe Dirty Dozenare inspired characters, the humans less so.

{"description": "Australian director Scott Hicks's follow-up to his widely belovedShinecomes as a small shock. Based on David Guterson'sbestselling novel,Snow Falling on Cedarsis far removed from the  character-driven, pure storytelling ofShineand a comparative plunge  into moody atmospherics. Action insinuates itself  through the director's determined eye for watercolor composition  and free-floating perspective, like random shoots of new growth in an  overwhelming rain forest. It's impossible to be complacent as a viewer  because Hicks's meditative style paradoxically forces one to locate and make  the story happen internally.The approach makes good aesthetic sense in that Guterson's story couches  courtroom drama in dreamy textures, and Hicks is determined to reflect that even if it means turning an audience's idea of narrative on its head. He also  gets a lot of help from the weather in the Pacific Northwest: the setting is  one of Washington State's San Juan Islands, where rain embraces earth and sky in a singular, introverted  personality. There, a Japanese American war hero (Rick Yune) stands  accused of murdering a white fisherman in the years following World  War&nbsp;II. His wife (Youki Kudoh) is the former childhood sweetheart and lover  of a  local newspaperman (Ethan Hawke) whose bitterness over the loss--as well as his helplessness during the internment of  Japanese Americans, and the crusading legacy of his journalist father (Sam  Shepard)--prevents him from coming to the defense of the accused man.Layered emotions, layered sensations, layered clouds. This is historical  fiction of a sort that works best as an experience of time's relativity:  flowing, stopping, trickling. Ironically, the film's most commercial element,  the trial, is the least interesting aspect, though old pro Max Von Sydow  makes those scenes great fun as a wily defense counsel.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EXDSCK", "B000NTPG7A", "067976402X", "B0051HCURS", "B004SIP6C2", "B00005MEVY", "B0009298P2", "B00005JKGK", "B005DCJ1J6", "B004SIP6QI", "0151001006", "B000038IDY", "B005KG4CUS", "B00197POZO", "1586634909", "B001KEHAEE", "B0012OX7EO", "B004SIP83Y", "B000CQLZ8S", "B00083FZFE", "B00FPUN21O", "B004SIP7F8", "0743457579", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B00G15MDI0", "B007RL2R9M", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B003EYVXRS", "B00166UFTS", "B002ZG99EK", "B0013XZ6X4", "B0045HCJRQ", "B000EHRVMY", "B00GUO2SKA", "B000RF7XYO", "B003ASLJQ8", "B000DN5W1G", "B001FB55L2", "B000P5FH3K", "B004UXUUDA", "B000HC2LHG", "B000056KMW", "B00H7LJ2UO", "B004UXUX4Q", "B004AE3QYE", "B009IQG5M4", "B002AT4PA0", "B00H9L26AA", "B008PJZDX2", "B0007OP1XA", "630523650X", "B00G7QPXUI", "B00BTYU3SK", "B00011Y1PI", "B00HLTD49C", "B004VHOAGS", "B00AEFY8MM", "B000BYRCQU", "6305428522", "B000QGEB1M", "B0006TPE4C", "B002OVB9YE", "B00007G1WH", "B004SIP71M", "B0064MT1LM", "0780619587", "B004SUDQ8G", "B000ZOXDFA", "B001CITQWM", "1477513981", "B00AEFXGIY", "0767811100", "B0071HPP3M", "B00GJT2OWS", "B0007QJ210", "B000BOH904", "B00JBGWP3Y", "B004SIP9U6", "B000R4SMCW", "B0007Z0NYQ", "B006FE83UE", "B000KX0IOA", "B004SIP8W0", "B004SEUJ82", "B0002O7XVI", "B001P9KR8U", "B00B4ZN3XQ", "B00028G7IO", "B0009W5IMO", "B004SEUJOQ", "B0001V6ZK2", "B000NOIX48", "B000P0J092", "6305428352", "6304883773", "B00GST8U4U", "B000I0RNV6", "B0064MT1FI", "B00005PJ6V", "B000P0J0AG"], "bought_together": ["067976402X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["067976402X", "B000NTPG7A", "B000EXDSCK", "B00005JKGK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 24564}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.49, "brand": "Universal", "asin": "0783240325", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513NKVN69ML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Snow Falling on Cedars"}

{"description": "Peter Sellers's third go-around as the prideful but bumbling Inspector Jacques Clouseau is funny enough, but this 1975 Blake Edwards revival of the Sellers-Clouseau connection is a little weak in comparison to predecessors \"The Pink Panther\" and \"A Shot in the Dark\" (both made in 1964). Costar Christopher Plummer actually gets some of the most interesting screen time as a retired cat burglar whom Clouseau accuses of getting back into the business. (If it sounds like there might be a \"To Catch a Thief\" vibe mixed in here, you're right.) Herbert Lom is hilarious as Clouseau's psychologically eroding boss, and Clouseau's ritualistic collisions with valet Cato (Burt Kwouk) are great examples of Edwards's delicious comic timing. \"--Tom Keogh\"", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001AG01M", "B000CEXFC4", "B0009S4J3C", "6305308748", "B0009S4J3M", "B0009S4J32", "B001HUWQGS", "B0009S4J4G", "B000CCBCDK", "B00260HH1M", "B001IHJ988", "B000VIMHPM", "B000FBH3V8", "B000055Y0X", "B00009MEKJ", "B00005RDRO", "B001LXIDUY", "B004FPXMG0", "B00005JKH9", "B00LC4PFVW", "B0009S4J2I", "B003NTUOGU", "B00005JL0I", "B000CEXFBK", "B0001Y9YJ8", "B0000CBY1C", "B001EZE5FG", "B001KEHAHQ", "B000CNFC4E", "B001KMB7DG", "B001IHJ974", "B0007R4SX6", "B00AEFXDO6", "B000NDEXPM", "B00132D7XQ", "B0045HCJ9E", "B000G6BLWE", "B00014NEX0", "B00D3LA6AW", "B000FZETR0", "B00009YXEW", "B003L2BZ0I", "B00AEFYRJQ", "B000063K2R", "B00005O3VC", "B0000AUHPB", "B0045HCJHG", "B001NPD9R2", "B0045HCJ7G", "B00008MTW6", "B000NDEXPC", "B000C20VNM", "B008YAPQX4", "B0009S4J28", "B004EPZ00C", "B0024FADAQ", "0783225903", "B0065N6K9Q", "B00077BPF0", "B0018KGVA4", "B000O599NK", "B00AEFYT1W", "B00004RG62", "B001D7T6AO", "B000M53GLS", "B00K6J7Q6G", "B000WTVZHQ", "B000ATQYT2", "B000NIBUS0", "B000E6ESI0", "B00066FBQG", "B000FFJYAM", "B001LMAK6A", "B001PO550A", "B00151QYYE", "B00009IB1F", "B001AXOFR0", "B00005JXY3"], "bought_together": ["B0001AG01M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001AG01M", "B0009S4J3C", "6305308748", "B000CEXFC4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 184019}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.84, "brand": "", "asin": "0784012644", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QP9KH894L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Return of the Pink Panther"}

Arnold plays an &quot;eraser&quot; from the Federal Witness Protection Program, so named because he can virtually erase the existence of anyone he's been assigned to protect. His latest beneficiary is an FBI employee (Vanessa Williams) who stumbled across a secret government group involved in the sale and export of an advanced weapon capable of shooting rounds at nearly the speed of light.

{"description": "Director William Friedkin was a hot ticket in Hollywood after the success ofThe French Connection, and he turned heads (in more ways than one) when he decided to makeThe Exorcistas his follow-up film. Adapted by William Peter Blatty from hiscontroversial bestseller, this shocking 1973 thriller set an intense and often-copied milestone for screen terror with its unflinching depiction of a young girl (Linda Blair) who is possessed by an evil spirit. Jason Miller and Max von Sydow are perfectly cast as the priests who risk their sanity and their lives to administer the rites of demonic exorcism, and Ellen Burstyn plays Blair's mother, who can only stand by in horror as her daughter's body is wracked by satanic disfiguration. One of the most frightening films ever made,The Exorcistwas mysteriously plagued by troubles during production, and the years have not diminished its capacity to disturb even the most stoical viewers. The film is presented in letterbox format on digital video disc, with a soundtrack that's guaranteed to curdle your blood.

{"description": "Stanley Kubrick'sThe Shiningis less an adaptation of Stephen King's bestselling horror novel than a complete reimagining of it from the inside out. In King's book, the Overlook Hotel is a haunted place that takes possession of its off-season caretaker and provokes him to murderous rage against his wife and young son. Kubrick's movie is an existential Road Runner cartoon (his steadicam scurrying through the hotel's labyrinthine hallways), in which the cavernously empty spaces inside the Overlook mirror the emptiness in the soul of the blocked writer, who's settled in for a long winter's hibernation. As many have pointed out, King's protagonist goes mad, but Kubrick's Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is Looney Tunes from the moment we meet him--all arching eyebrows and mischievous grin. (Both Nicholson and Shelley Duvall reach new levels of hysteria in their performances, driven to extremes by the director's fanatical demands for take after take after take.)The Shiningis terrifying--but not in the way fans of the novel might expect. When it was redone as a TV miniseries (reportedly because of King's dissatisfaction with the Kubrick film), the famous topiary-animal attack (which was deemed impossible to film in 1980) was there--but the deeper horror was lost. Kubrick'sThe Shininggets under your skin and chills your bones; it stays with you, inhabits you, haunts you. And there's no place to hide...--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300267881", "0790734079", "B00005ATQA", "6302038308", "6300182770", "B0009RRUKW", "0783235607", "0783228317", "B00000J2KZ", "B00004RNAC", "0790736039", "B00023NRSM", "6304508611", "6300182878", "6302921058", "6304509154", "0783216084", "6300214087", "B00004W5UA", "6301427076", "630268644X", "B000003KHS", "B000AMW2TK", "0790700506", "6300181340", "6300214753", "6302054982", "0784011923", "6305363668", "6303686796", "6305095566", "630021639X", "6302822688", "6305576173", "0783246641", "6304994540", "6303953425", "B00004U8PA", "0792158261", "0792100085", "6300213986", "6300189015", "630533577X", "6300214826", "0792846303", "6304288433", "6300147630", "0792842111", "B000007OY0", "0790741512", "6302158176", "0792846311", "6300183416", "0800103106", "B000005PFL", "6300183211", "0790733927", "6301666569", "6301871952", "0767825411", "630339406X", "6303109950", "6300216500", "6300214192", "6300262731", "6303257674", "6304214502", "630018627X", "6300214311", "1558807381", "0792839234", "0767819187", "B00005B238", "0790731975", "6303579388", "B000059HFB", "6302798450", "B00000FZCU", "6303651461", "6303566391", "6302642175", "6301971582", "6300218058", "6301094352", "6300184064", "6300181278", "6304457383", "6300214672", "6300262855", "0800125762", "6303257305"], "bought_together": ["0790734079"], "also_viewed": ["6300147630", "6300182878", "B00005ATQA", "6300189015", "6300267881", "B00023NRSM", "6300213005", "6303953425", "0307743659", "6303148352", "0790734079", "B001AQT0Z4", "6300183211", "0784011923", "B00BBND56G", "0788806270"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 268792}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0790705141", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5106FV0S4PL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Shining [VHS]"}
{"description": "A strong candidate for the designation of most thrilling action movie ever made (the turbo-charged exhilaration of its full-throttle highway chases has never been equaled), the second part of George Miller's post-apocalyptic trilogy is also a magnificently imagined movie myth. Like theStar Warstrilogy (by that other George) theMad Maxfilms draw their inspiration from the works of mythologist Joseph Campbell. In the 1979 original, Max (Mel Gibson) is a policeman, the last guardian of civilization and order in a devastated world reduced to chaos. But when a leather-clad gang of sadomasochistic speed demons mows down Max's family, his remaining connections to humanity are also permanently severed. After brutally exacting his revenge, Max wanders off into the wasteland alone, &quot;a burned out shell of a man&quot; who (to paraphraseThe Searchers) is destined to wander forever between the winds. InThe Road Warrior, Max rediscovers a sliver of his shattered humanity, and a spark of redemption, when he helps an embattled colony of pioneers fight off the savages who are after that most precious of all commodities: &quot;guzzline.&quot; Max is transformed into a legendary hero, just as Mel Gibson was catapulted to international movie stardom. With its final stirring images,The Road Warriortranscends its genre (whatever that may be--science fiction? Western? action adventure?) and becomes something timeless. It's a great movie.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005R2IS", "0790731932", "B00004Y87O", "B00AEFYDM2", "B003XURDAY", "B00005N5S5", "B00005N7Z1", "0783241895", "B001VLBDD0", "B0002CHK1S", "B000QUCQX8", "B000U1ZV8K", "B003ELKNH2", "B0038SUBEG", "B00000ILDD", "B000RW3VCK", "B0068FZ0O2", "B00AKGG828", "B00AEBBADG", "B00003CXC5", "B00I9TDMRM", "B008CYDD7I", "B00D7AM6M0", "B0000AOX0F", "0783227434", "B00005JMEW", "B003ASLJS6", "0783227396", "B002GHHHME", "0767802519", "1558908846", "B000E6ESEO", "0783228457", "6305821216", "B005J9ZFQG", "B0019BI1DM", "B00IBKXSKA", "B0087DFIYA", "B0000VD12I", "B001JFZ118", "B00005JMUA", "B00005JA8B", "B00005A3KS", "B000P0J0D8", "0790729695", "B004SIP8ZM", "B004SIP95G", "B0009UC810", "B0007WQHI0", "B0001Z37HM", "B0006GANN2", "B0045HCJIK", "B00005JLWN", "0767836316", "B0001611DI", "B000A2UBN4", "B000U1ZV7Q", "B000NA1WGS", "0792833244", "B000FS9FE4", "B002I9Z8AS", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B00005JLJW", "B000VECAD0", "6304806434", "B000056PMU", "B0045HCJGC", "B000P0J0BU", "B0045HCJ9O", "B00005ATQB", "B000022TSY", "B001CDR1FG", "B0045HCJT4", "B000CNESNA", "B00000JDIQ", "B00AEFXKUI", "B00026ZG10", "B000NOKFHQ", "B008Y1YK9Y", "6304698798", "B00004XPPG", "6305428115", "0783225946", "0800195175", "B000A7DVR2", "B003AWRMCE", "B0064NTZQ2", "B00070FX5U", "0792839056", "B000068IEV", "B00005AUK9", "B000WC3864", "B0002CHIKG", "B002AF4Y9G", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B00007AJG4", "B00003CXQA", "B0000A2ZU1", "B00BTYJYR6"], "bought_together": ["B00005R2IS", "0790731932"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BLRXDTQ", "B00005R2IS", "B000NA1WGS", "0790731932"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 19723}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 29.74, "brand": "Road Warrior", "asin": "0790729342", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ndgIMhPTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Road Warrior"}

And before he became familiar as a sidekick in 1970s disaster movies (Earthquakeand theAirportmovies), George Kennedy won an Oscar for playing Dragline, the brutal chain-gang boss who tries to beat loner Luke's cool out of him.

Arthur falls in love with a waitress (Liza Minnelli) who doesn't care about his money, but unfortunately Arthur's stern father wants him to marry a Waspy prima donna. The young lush turns to his wise and loyal butler (Oscar-winner John Gielgud) for assistance and advice.Arthurwas a huge hit when released in 1981, as was its Oscar-winning theme song by Christopher Cross. Few remember that the movie was, sadly, the only one ever made by writer-director Steve Gordon, who died less than a year after the film's release.

{"description": "From yet another derivative science fiction novel by Michael Crichton comes this equally derivative and flaccid movie, in which three top Hollywood stars struggle to squeeze tension and excitement out of material that doesn't match their talents. You're supposed to find awe and mystery in Crichton's story about a team of scientists and scholars who discover a 300-year-old alien spacecraft deep on the ocean floor, but mostly you feel that this is all much ado about nothing. The exploration team consists of a psychologist (Dustin Hoffman), mathematician (Samuel L. Jackson), biochemist (Sharon Stone), and an astrophysicist (Liev Schreiber), and when they enter the alien ship they discover a mysterious sphere inside. What they don't know is that the sphere has the power to manipulate their thoughts and perceptions, and before long the scientists' undersea habitat is a veritable haunted house of frightening visions and creeping paranoia. Who can be trusted? What is the sphere's purpose, and why is it on the ocean floor?Spheremakes some attempt to answer these questions, but the film is a mess, and it leads to one of the most anticlimactic endings of any science fiction film ever made. There are moments of high intensity and psychological suspense, and the stellar cast works hard to boost the talky screenplay. But it's clear that this was a hurried production (Hoffman and director Barry Levinson madeWag the Dogduring an extended production delay), and as a resultSpherelooks and feels like a film that wasn't quite ready for the cameras. Though it's by no means a waste of time, it's undeniably disappointing. The special edition DVD includes audio commentary by Hoffman and Jackson and a behind-the-scenes featurette,Shaping the Sphere: The Art of the Special Effects Supervisor,exploring the alien ship's design and creation by special effects technicians.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFXW8I", "6305922675", "B0045HCJ0S", "B00003CWU3", "B00008G8LY", "B00AEFXPMG", "B002GHHHKQ", "B002QW7ALM", "B002GIBVVG", "B00000IQVQ", "0780622650", "B00005O5AX", "B00009ATIX", "B00AEFYXQI", "B00008438U", "6305090564", "B0045HCJ9O", "B0019BI1DM", "B000Y7U98C", "6305767866", "B00AEFXPSK", "B0002V7OI8", "B00005O5B5", "B0045HCJKS", "0792839684", "0800195175", "B002GHHHL0", "B000B8GT92", "B00AEBB8QK", "B000TJ6PBK", "B0000844I8", "B000QUCRB4", "6304779631", "B00000ILDF", "B00070FX5U", "B00HF00RJW", "B005LAIHXQ", "B0006GANOQ", "B00003CY6P", "B0045HCJT4", "B00000G3PA", "B000056PMU", "B00005JPAR", "B00JL6L4UY", "6305238065", "B004L9GMBC", "B001DZOC6Y", "0061990558", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B000NTMA0Q", "6304806434", "B00005JL78", "B00BX8PG4S", "B000U1ZV8K", "B0045HCJGC", "B00008K76U", "B0000640VR", "B004EPYZPS", "B002O3Z4WK", "0784011338", "B003TRMLQM", "B00153ZR8G", "B004XQO90O", "B00JA3RVG4", "B00IKM5LXG", "B0007PALZ2", "B0045HCJFS", "0790730979", "B00003CXKA", "0783225733", "B00000ILDG", "B00J11U54K", "B000P0J0BU", "B0045HCJ8A", "B003XURDAY", "B00008OE4W", "B002AT8K9W", "B000E5N684", "B000OT6V0K", "B00DMEBXDE", "B002GHHHME", "B00003CXKM", "B000A2UBN4", "0767803434", "B00004Y87O", "1558908846", "B000XT1P4S", "B002ZG980U", "078321958X", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B00IE41A9O", "0790736411", "B00012QLB4", "B00001QGUM", "078322799X", "B008JFUO36", "B00AKGG828", "B00AEFYD9K", "B00BB67UNW", "6305718954"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFXW8I", "6305922675"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000E1NXAY", "B002GHHHKQ", "B00005O5AX", "B002QW7ALM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 131106}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.0, "brand": "HOFFMAN,D/STONE,S", "asin": "079073639X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41B5fux4t8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sphere (Special Edition)"}
{"description": "The opening and closing moments of Robert (Forrest Gump) Zemeckis'sContactastonish viewers with the sort of breathtaking conceptual imagery one hardly ever sees in movies these days--each is an expression of the heroine's lifelong quest (both spiritual and scientific) to explore the meaning of human existence through contact with extraterrestrial life. The movie begins by soaring far out into space, then returns dizzyingly to earth until all the stars in the heavens condense into the sparkle in one little girl's eye. It ends with that same girl as an adult (Jodie Foster)--her search having taken her to places beyond her imagination--turning her gaze inward and seeing the universe in a handful of sand.Contacttraces the journey between those two visual epiphanies. Based on Carl Sagan's novel,Contactis exceptionally thoughtful and provocative for a big-budget Hollywood science fiction picture, with elements that recall everything from2001toThe Right Stuff. Foster's solid performance (and some really incredible alien hardware) keep viewers interested, even when the story skips and meanders, or when the halo around the golden locks of rising-star-of-a-different-kind Matthew McConaughey (as the pure-Hollywood-hokum love interest) reaches Milky Way-level wattage.

{"description": "Steven Seagal has always been an awkward action hero. Initially, he had  a certain amount of credibility thanks to his nebulous association with secret government agencies and mastery of aikido, which helped to excuse his bad acting. But as a self-righteous action hero in the vein of Schwarzenegger and Stallone (which helps to explain his bad acting), Seagal fell into unintentional self-parody faster and more dramatically than either of his two predecessors. InOut for Justice, Seagal plays Gino Felino, a Brooklyn-born cop known and respected by everyone--both good and bad--in his neighborhood. The worst of the neighborhood baddies is Richie Madano (William Forsythe), a crack-smoking killer who murders his partner and terrorizes the neighborhood. Technically, Felino is a terrible cop--touching evidence at murder scenes, stealing evidence, intimidating witnesses--but only by breaking those rules can he bring in this horrible criminal. As his soon-to-be-ex-wife discovers, he does everything because he cares too much. Julianna Margulies (ER) has a small but thankless role as Richie's hooker girlfriend, and Gina Gershon (Face/Off,Bound) has an equally thankless role  as Richie's foul-mouthed, bar-owning sister. The movie plays like a vanity piece for Seagal, and in that vein, it is fascinating to watch.--Andy Spletzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000QXDCLU", "B000E0WJLE", "6304779089", "6304779178", "0790732238", "B001T21R5K", "0790740826", "B001B3LIOC", "0790729334", "B00003CXW4", "B0045HCIWW", "B000006PAB", "B001AR010Q", "B0030E5PWQ", "B000VECACQ", "6304712898", "B000A5043S", "6305428158", "B004MLEYUU", "B000E6ESD0", "B0090EDEM8", "B001VFM0YC", "B00083FZEU", "B002G1WPIG", "B00007JZUP", "B0045HCJG2", "B000255LCK", "B0000844MD", "B00005QAP6", "B000U1ZV6C", "B00441GYY2", "B0045HCJFS", "B00009ZPTZ", "B00006RCOC", "B004SEUJ1O", "0783114885", "B001M9ELQC", "B0000542CD", "076780970X", "B000RW3VCK", "0783228465", "B000F6IOCA", "0767804252", "B0011VIO4Q", "B0045HCJGC", "B002WSZSNM", "B008NP4ZUU", "B0006JGIQU", "B008XAT0SW", "B000O78KW4", "B000056PNL", "0783227892", "B0002S94CK", "B000FI8MPW", "B00AKGG828", "B000055Y0Y", "B001T21R5U", "B000MEYKEG", "B001O7JHS4", "B00FEHCPZ2", "0790732149", "B00005JKIP", "B000LC4Z7Q", "B0006VL1IS", "B00005O06W", "6305259429", "B001MLZNKS", "B0002J58HO", "B002GHHHME", "B003VA3JZY", "6304698747", "B0001FGBWK", "B002AS466O", "6305428115", "B00598O9Q4", "B000LPR6G0", "B002AT8KA6", "B0004Z33EQ", "B000E8QVCO", "B0004Z33F0", "0783226888", "B00000JDIQ", "6304779631", "B00006FDAP", "B00004Y87N", "B003ASLJIQ", "B0050MB5NO", "B006A8XFUI", "B00AEBB8LA", "6305133409", "B002AT8K9W", "B004V4RT8C", "B00005O06Q", "B00004STDN", "B00AEFXVOI", "B00A4TMLNG", "B0041QSZS8", "B0038Z5SEM", "B00AEFYF2K", "0780618548"], "bought_together": ["B000QXDCLU", "B001B3LIOC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000QXDCLU", "B0050MB5NO", "6304779089", "B0045HCIWW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 167776}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.54, "brand": "WEA", "asin": "0790740834", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71AVEGK3Q4L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Out for Justice"}

Neo has always questioned his reality, but the truth is far beyond his imagination. Neo finds himself targeted by the police when he is contacted by Morpheus, a legendary computer hacker branded a terrorist by the government. Morpheus awakens Neo to the real world, a ravaged wasteland where most of humanity have been captured by a race of machines that live off of the humans' body heat and electrochemical energy and who imprison their minds within an artificial reality known as the Matrix. As a rebel against the machines, Neo must return to the Matrix and confront the agents: super-powerful computer programs devoted to snuffing out Neo and the entire human rebellion.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JLTM", "B0001DI5W6", "0784011923", "B001FB55HQ", "0792845684", "B001DZFYPW", "0790731975", "6300271331", "B00003CXE6", "0792839846", "0792133153", "6303257844", "6303313345", "6300182304", "6303168507", "B00000JGEK", "6304071876", "6300215830", "6301963725", "0800199421", "6303398480", "6305363668", "6303202004", "079213690X", "6304258984", "B0000509BZ", "6304434170", "630018627X", "6301976622", "0783222955", "6302610702", "6302787564", "0800132009", "0767825411", "6303020089", "6301574117", "6302909023", "B000003KHS"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLTM", "B0001DI5W6"], "also_viewed": ["B001DJLD1M", "B0054509I4", "B001CEE1YE", "B00005JKCH", "6303148352", "B000AYELVA", "B001GZ6QEC", "B001JNNDBA", "B0000AXE8I", "B0001DI5W6", "6303215734", "B00005JLTM", "B0007WFX62", "6304143184", "B00005N5S5", "B001AQT0Z4", "B001FB55HQ", "B0013FBS20", "B0001BKAEY", "B000PC6A3E", "B00007ELF1", "B00005JMQW", "B0000633U4", "1880521008", "B004XKVPG6", "B00ANGID14", "B001RIY4WE", "B008M4MB8K", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00B4804KS", "B00E5I2MCM", "B005LAIHY0", "B0013FSL3E", "B00471JSRE", "B0057R5XRG", "B00E9PMMX0", "B00C3MKCF6", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00AQNOCZ0", "B00IWULSTC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 579943}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.97, "brand": "", "asin": "0790745399", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51208Z0A3HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Matrix"}

{"description": "The great improvisational comedy team of Mike Nichols and Elaine May reunited to (respectively) direct and write this update of the French comedyLa Cage Aux Folles. Robin Williams stars as a gay Miami nightclub owner who is forced to play it straight and ask his drag-queen partner (Nathan Lane) to hide out when Williams's son invites his prospective--and highly conservative--in-laws and fianc&eacute;e to a meet-and-greet dinner party. Gene Hackman and Dianne Wiest play the straight-laced senator and his wife, and Calista Flockhart (from television'sAlly McBeal) plays their daughter in a culture-clash with outrageous consequences. May's witty screenplay incorporates some pointed observations about the political landscape of the 1990s and takes a sensitive approach to the comedy's underlying drama. Topping off the action is Hank Azaria in a scene-stealing role as Williams's and Lane's flamboyant housekeeper, &quot;Agador Spartacus.&quot;--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000714BP", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00DW5IJR6", "0792843983", "B00EPH8SBM", "B0001HAGRE", "B00005BKZP", "B000ZM1MG4", "B004VJJGFG", "B007XTDWKQ", "B000EHRVOW", "B00081U7HC", "6305127670", "B000SFOW8I", "6305236569", "0783226772", "B0045HCJIK", "6305161879", "0783227396", "0800141849", "B00066FBQG", "078322740X", "6305609764", "B000B8QG22", "B0045HCJGW", "B000EGDB10", "B000056PMU", "B00003CWN3", "B00005JOFQ", "B000YDBPAM", "B0000AOV4I", "B00009W5CA", "B0000YEEGM", "B003Y5H5B0", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00005A06N", "B00386EZKE", "B00466HN7M", "B00GHP8SH4", "B000ELJAEM", "B001ECDVJU", "B002OOWKYE", "B00009WVSL", "B0001AVZA8", "B000K7VHLY", "B004EPYZUS", "B009NYF2GQ", "6305212112", "B0045HCJ80", "6305133468", "B008R65XMO", "B000LP6KNU", "B00AEFYRJQ", "B0000JBALO", "0784011710", "B00006FMUW", "B00008979E", "B00F98FOPE", "B0030ATZH6", "B0037XPPAM", "0800141806", "B00AEFXTKO", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000TXP56C", "B0041QSZS8", "B0002WZTOI", "B00004TJKK", "B00004RJ73", "B0038N9WKU", "B002JCSWV6", "B004A8ZWVK", "B00079Z9VO", "B00005ALS0", "B00AMSS3TA", "B004SEUJK0", "B0001ZX0O2", "630587493X", "0783227388", "B003ASLJQ8", "B000BT970O", "6305433909", "B0045HCJSA", "B002O3Z50G", "B0000CBY1C", "B002NZK5RS", "0790742071", "B00028HBIO", "B0007IO6NM", "0800177991", "B007N31YH0", "B0009DWL8W", "B00IA7MFEO", "B0000DIXDR", "6304711905", "B00COHGPD8", "B001P3SA94", "B0001Z4OXS", "B001VLBDD0", "B002NZK5V4", "B00JAQJMJ0"], "bought_together": ["B0000714BP", "B00EPH8SBM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000714BP", "B0015RRN84", "0792843983"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2129}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.67, "brand": "Mgm/Ua Studios", "asin": "0792833198", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AJN9TDTWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Birdcage"}
{"description": "The only remaining evidence that Sylvester Stallone might have had a respectable career, this 1976 Oscar winner (for Best Picture, Director, and Editing) is still the quintessential ode to an underdog and one of the best boxing movies ever made. After writing the script about a two-bit boxer who gets a &quot;million-to-one shot&quot; against the world heavyweight champion, Stallone insisted that he star in the title role, and his equally unknown status helped to catapult him (and this rousing film) to overnight success. The story is familiar, but it has been handled with such vitality and emotional honesty that you can't help but leap and cheer for Rocky Balboa, the chump turned champ (despite his valiant defeat in the ring) who stuns the boxing world with the support of his timid girlfriend, Adrian (Talia Shire), and grizzled trainer, Gus (Burgess Meredith). Oscar nominations went to all the lead actors (including Burt Young as Adrian's hot-tempered brother), but four sequels could never top the universal appeal of this low-budget crowd pleaser.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006GAOG8", "B0006GAO6I", "B0006GAOGI", "B000N4SHPS", "B0006GAOGS", "B007STBUHI", "B00005MEOU", "B000ICM5O4", "B00AEFY0F2", "6304907729", "B00004W221", "B000IJ79UW", "B00000HZY2", "B007N31YH0", "B00004XPPC", "B004FQX5A2", "B0014Z4OMU", "B00003CXBU", "B0008JIJ2E", "B000XJD34I", "B007SPPANM", "B000ARTN3I", "B0001US8F8", "B000KX0IOA", "B003ASLJQI", "0792843592", "0780021312", "B00079Z9VO", "B00J2AU8MY", "B001LXIDVI", "B0068FZ0GK", "B00AEBB9FA", "B000BYA4HE", "B000EHRVOW", "B00006ADD5", "B0010AN7Z4", "B00066FBQG", "B000BITV92", "B0087ZG7HK", "B000IJ79WU", "B000059H9A", "B000ZM1MG4", "B0002WZTOI", "B0001US66Y", "B0049985XW", "B001GZ6QC4", "B000VECAD0", "B006FE83UE", "0792838041", "0800177258", "B004SIP7F8", "B00005JKCH", "B00AEFY6DI", "B00008K76U", "B00AEBB9F0", "B001AEF6BS", "B00004BZIY", "B004QBWU02", "B0060ZJ7BC", "B00011D1OK", "B00004TVUD", "B000HE2ZUW"], "bought_together": ["B0006GAOG8", "B0006GAO6I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000WC3A0S", "B004FQX5C0", "B00J4BW10S", "B000N4SHPS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 405226}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.85, "brand": "", "asin": "079283321X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AP5MY2B5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rocky (1976)"}

This James Bond is a bit more vulnerable and psychologically complex--and just a shade more politically correct--but he's still a formally attired playboy at heart, with a lovely Russian beauty (Izabella Scorupco) as his sexy ally against a cadre of renegade Russians bent on--what else?--global domination. There's also a seductive villainous with the suggestive name of Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen), and the great actress Judi Dench makes her first appearance as Bond's superior, M, who wisecracks about 007's &quot;dinosaur&quot; status as a globetrotting sexist. All in all, this action-packed Bond adventure provided a much-needed boost the long-running movie series, revitalizing the 007 franchise for the turn of the millennium.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000RPCK1U", "B000NIBURQ", "B001EDVNNU", "B000NDEXPM", "B000M53GMW", "B000RPCK24", "B000RPCK1K", "B000RPCK1A", "B001R10BN2", "B000NIBURG", "B000NIBUR6", "B000M53GN6", "B000M53GLS", "B000NIBUS0", "B000M53GNG", "B000RPCK0Q", "B000NDEXPC", "B000M53GMC", "B00AQSN7HE", "B001PPLIEG", "B00004RG62", "B00004WEJZ", "B007REV4T8", "B00005JL0I", "B008YAPQX4", "B009PN18R2", "B009PN3OD8", "B004BR7XLM", "B00AZFECL8", "0767803434", "6305657947", "B0014Z4ON4", "B004P7CN3G", "B0000BYRO9", "B000SK5Z70", "B000EGDB10", "B00005N5S5", "B000ENC5YW", "B002GHHHME", "B00008K76U", "B00000JQB5", "B000RW3VCK", "B00AEFXKUI", "B0002S94CK", "B0014C2FX8", "B000JYW5BE", "B004LWZW6K", "B0015XHQT4", "B008YAPRBU", "B000ARXF96", "B0014Z4OMU", "6305133476", "B000N3SSBW", "B00026ZG10", "B0000VD12I", "B003XURDAY", "B0046MOVE4", "B00005A3KS", "B0002I84N0", "B000WP07F6", "B0007KZQAM", "0783225547", "B00000BLFI", "B00AEFYBA6", "B00005PJ8S", "B00AVWIQZS", "B00003CXC5", "B00011CZRE", "B00008G8M4", "B004EPYZUS", "B004IK30MI", "079284646X", "B00595W3QK", "B00AEBB8VK", "B00000G3PA", "B000FO0AA6", "B00AEFYDM2", "B008JFUS0U", "B006TTC5WC", "B00008K76W", "B0000BYRO7", "B001FB55HQ", "B000EHSVSC", "B0036TGSR6", "B00EALTW3G", "B002I9Z8BM", "B002GOAH1A", "B00096S4BM", "6304765258", "6304698801", "B000AP04FG", "B00407PNWO", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00005JN2Z", "0790729997", "B00GHH9GXC", "B002ZG98LO", "B000HRMAPE", "0783226012"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000M53GN6", "B000RPCK0Q", "B00I9TDMCM", "B001R10BN2"]}, "price": 12.49, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 255435}, "asin": "079283318X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DZYMD2RDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "GoldenEye (Special Edition)"}

Catherine Hicks plays the child's mother, and Chris Sarandon a detective; neither of them knows what to make of the kid's story.

{"description": "It's the hope that sustains the spirit of every GI: the dream of the day when he will finally return home. For three WWII veterans, the day has arrived. But for each man, the dream is about to becomea nightmare.

Soon Elliot's lovely daughter, Enid, has spotted a mysterious craft in the middle of the moor.

Gambon plays a mystery writer named Philip E. Marlow, who is suffering a torturous bout of psoriatic arthritis in a British hospital, where he is a victim of both his disease and the national health plan. Unable to move without pain, he escapes into his imagination, plotting out a murder tale in which he is both a big-band singer and a private eye. But Potter and director Jon Amiel also mix in flashbacks of Marlow's youth and his unhappy marriage to explain how the real Marlow reached this sorry pass. Flawlessly, intricately, kaleidoscopically assembled, the six one-hour episodes of this British miniseries fly by like some fantastic fever dream.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001Z4P6O", "B00006A8T3"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 367639}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 17.5, "brand": "", "asin": "0793970113", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/410PMJQA7CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Singing Detective [VHS]"}
{"description": "If you think Jim Carrey's comedy is an acquired taste, think ofThe Cable Guyas a potent bottle of bittersweet wine. The film has a lingering aftertaste, but it is just a bit too dark, a bit too extreme to invite another serving. On the other hand, you've got to give Carrey some credit for risking his $20-million paycheck (and a big chunk of box-office revenue) on this black comedy. A needy, psychologically unbalanced cable-television installer (Carrey) forces his friendship upon an unsuspecting bachelor (Matthew Broderick) who has just broken up with his fianc&eacute;e. The movie gets edgier and more desperate--and in some respects funnier--as Carrey's cable guy gradually goes crazy. Director Ben Stiller manages to pack some pointed social commentary into the movie's many humorous detours.  Although it was a box-office disappointment,The Cable Guyis nevertheless a daring comedy for those who have had their fill ofAce Ventura.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CXE4", "0783235070", "B00081912E", "B00AEBB9SM", "B002BIULKS", "B000P0J06A", "B000BKJ762", "0790732157", "B003PIUIHO", "B001SN78JO", "B0000AKCKI", "B00003CWTL", "B000OYC7BW", "B004H83IJQ", "B000E8N8H0", "B008R65XUQ", "B002BIULL2", "B00AEBBA2C", "630529142X", "B00000K3UU", "B00005JL93", "B00AEFXIUK", "B0000CDRVX", "B006TTC5PY", "B00005NGAY", "B00005JM4Q", "B000ELJAEM", "B00AEFXPG2", "B00003CXPS", "B00AEFYZCU", "155890834X", "B0068FZ0O2", "B000HT386M", "B00009PY3X", "B00005JKNC", "B00005KA6V", "B000PHX5P0", "B00003GPFT", "B00005JMYI", "B004A8ZX3C", "B004H83IM8", "B00003CXO1", "B00005OCJP", "B000068TPB", "B00AEBB9K0", "0792842162", "B00AEFYS2M", "B00024JC4E", "B00177YA1K", "B000FP2OPO", "B0009P42WI", "B00005JMJG", "0783227345", "B000CPH9PM", "B000A3XYIM", "B00AEBB9GY", "B008R65XTC", "B000U1ZV4Y", "B0009HBPN0", "B002ZG971U", "6304806434", "6305161860", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000VXWX7E", "6305428263", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00004TJMW", "B000WZEZGI", "B0006GANPA", "6305433925", "B000068MBS", "B00AEFYIQ8", "B00AEFYPXY", "B000I0RNVQ", "B0016MOV92", "B00000K3U4", "0800195175", "B000067FP8", "B001G5T6GW", "B00E1HIX66", "B000MGBSJE", "B00013RC7K", "B00441GYVA", "B002ZG9800", "B0009ZE9VW", "B0000VD11E", "B0009X761E", "B0015XHQT4", "B000K405CY", "B004P7CMZ0", "B0016MJ6J2", "B00001U0BN", "6304711891", "B00003CXS7", "B000MCH5RM", "6305017115", "B00JHH21AE", "B00000JMOD", "B001AEF6C2"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXE4", "0783235070"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CXE4", "0783235070", "0790732157", "B00AEBB9SM"]}, "price": 13.49, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 32844}, "asin": "0800141687", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q8NQFB21L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Cable Guy"}
{"description": "Bill Murray does warmth in his most consistently effective post-Stripescomedy, a romantic fantasy about a wacky weatherman forced to relive one strange day over and over again, until he gets it right. Snowed in during a road-trip expedition to watch the famous groundhog encounter his shadow, Murray falls into a time warp that is never explained but pays off so richly that it doesn't need to be. The elaborate loop-the-loop plot structure cooked up by screenwriter Danny Rubin is crystal-clear every step of the way, but it's Murray's world-class reactive timing that makes the jokes explode, and we end up looking forward to each new variation. He squeezes all the available juice out of every scene. Without forcing the issue, he makes us understand why this fly-away personality responds so intensely to the radiant sanity of the TV producer played by Andie MacDowell. The blissfully clueless Chris Elliott (Cabin Boy) is Murray's nudnik cameraman.--David Chute", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004RJ73", "B00287Z18Y", "6305609764", "B00005PJ6O", "B007P9HW3M", "0790740044", "B00AEFXXMI", "0783227388", "6305236569", "B00000IQBW", "B000E33W1W", "0804141444", "B0009RCPY8", "B0019HQICW", "B001AGXEAG", "B00AEFXDO6", "0767818105", "0792844890", "B002O3Z4YI", "B0000A14TA", "B0014Z4OMU", "B000K7VHTQ", "B00AEBBA2M", "B00005Y71F", "B00AEBB9SM", "B002GOAGZC", "B000G6BLW4", "B001IHJ988", "B00008G8LM", "B001LXIDVI", "B000QQLVPQ", "B005LL817W", "B001LMAK9W", "B00AEBB9DM", "0767806808", "B008R65XKQ", "B000G6BLWE", "B00003CXC3", "B00005O5CM", "B000065V3P", "B00005JM4Q", "B00AEBB9E6", "B000ELJAEM", "B00AEFYS2M", "B00AEFY0F2", "0767836324", "B002T51X4Q", "0800195175", "B0009X760U", "B000A3XYIM", "B000VBIGD6", "B000069HYF", "B00003CXR4", "0790742071", "B00AEFY3MC", "B000PHVZNE", "B0000YTP02", "B000E6ESI0", "B000YDBPAM", "B007Y1NR1W", "B00158K0QU", "B00006FMUW", "B00BLN4UPG", "B00AEFYM2S", "B000HT3PPG", "B000056HEA", "B000068NNU", "B0045HCJ7G", "B000V4UFZK", "B004GJYRA0", "B004AOECXI", "B000YAF4MA", "B00AEFXPG2", "B0045HCIY0"], "bought_together": ["B00004RJ73", "B00287Z18Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004RJ73", "B00005PJ6O", "B000E33W1W", "B00287Z18Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 107101}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.42, "brand": "", "asin": "080017948X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21XPDM6RK1L.jpg", "title": "Groundhog Day"}
{"description": "1995 had already seen the box-office success of sword-wielding heroes inRob RoyandBraveheartwhen along came this glossy revision of the Arthurian legend, in which Lady Guinevere (Julia Ormond) is torn between her love for the noble King Arthur (Sean Connery) and the passionate knight Sir Lancelot (Richard Gere). As the story opens, Guinevere's lands are under attack by the evil knight Malagant (Ben Cross), and she must choose between marriage to Arthur and the security of Camelot, or encouraging the affections of Lancelot, who has heroically rescued her from a potentially lethal attack. Anyone looking for meticulous medieval authenticity won't find it here, but director Jerry Zucker (Ghost) keeps the action moving with exuberant spirit and glorious production values. Even if you don't completely believe Richard Gere as a somewhat too-contemporary Lancelot, the performances of Ormond and especially Connery are effortlessly appealing.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302025079"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 317504}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.88, "brand": "", "asin": "0800129806", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513PMC55B8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "First Knight [VHS]"}
{"description": "One of the best romantic comedies of the 1990s, this box-office hit cemented writer-director Cameron Crowe's reputation as &quot;the voice of a generation.&quot; Crowe could probably do without that label, but he's definitely in sync with the times with this savvy story about a sports agent (Tom Cruise) whose fall from grace motivates his quest for professional recovery, and the slow-dawning realization that he needs the love and respect of the single mom (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger in her breakthrough role) who has supported him through the worst of times. This is one of Cruise's best, most underrated performances, and in an Oscar-winning role, Cuba Gooding Jr. plays the football star who remains Jerry Maguire's only loyal client on a hard road to redemption and personal growth. If that sounds touchy-feely, it is only because Crowe has combined sharp entertainment with a depth of character that is rarely found in mainstream comedy.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000065V3G", "B0000YEEGM", "B000GAKDAG", "0767811100", "B0018QPPXW", "B0002WZTOI", "B00005B6JZ", "B00AEFXR1K", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00AEBB9WI", "0783226810", "B00081U7HC", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFXYJA", "B000XJD33O", "B00AEBB9LO", "B000G6BLHY", "B0068FZ0GK", "B000023VTP", "B004SEUJK0", "B00158K0QU", "B000MNOX94", "B00AEFXESQ", "B001ECDVK4", "B000957O82", "B0000DIXDR", "0780631536", "0783225733", "B00004W221", "B000EGDB10", "B0010YSD8Q", "B000056VP4", "630471193X", "B00005JG6N", "B000P0J0EW", "B00005JL78", "0800141806", "B00005JKG9", "0790730979", "B002VECM6S", "B0000AOV4I", "B000CCBCAS", "B000HRMAPE", "B0006GANPA", "6305236569", "B00005O5CM", "B00011CZRE", "B0038Z5T4Q", "B000053VB4", "B003ASLJQS", "B0000524E4", "B00AEFXE9U", "B00006ZXSL", "078324021X", "B000765IJK", "B00AEFY99O", "B00AEBB8NS", "B0002V7ON8", "B00015YVDG", "B002AT8KD8", "B007SPPANM", "0783233477", "B000035Z5G", "B007STBUHI", "B004SIP9U6", "B000E5N684", "B00AEFXYOA", "B001LGXIA6", "B002GOAGZC", "B000FI8MPW", "B002O3Z510", "B000N6U0E2", "B000069HZP", "B00AEFY5B6", "B000068NNU", "B00001ZWUS", "B004AOECXI", "B00AEFXN9G", "B000YDBPAM", "B002ZG9864", "B003QO8TOQ", "0792843592", "B0013FCWUW", "B000P0J0EM", "B000QQLVPQ", "B000HEWEE4", "B0001AVZA8", "B00000G3PA", "B000XT1P3E", "B0006N2EZ0", "B00008G8LM", "B00005JNTI", "6304765266", "B00AEFXT1S", "B003UESJHO", "B00004WG2F", "B00005T7HW", "B004L3AR0K", "6305128952"], "bought_together": ["B0002WZTOI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001680M26", "B0002WZTOI", "0792838467", "B000065V3G"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8726}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.0, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "0800141741", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KBVJ813VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jerry Maguire"}

{"description": "After slaying the Arthurian legend in their now classic Holy Grail, the Pythons set their sights on the Greatest Story Ever Told.

{"description": "An ultra-cheap B-horror movie, filmed in Lawrence, Kansas, in 1962, with a  really creepyTwilight Zone-style premise and some great shoestring atmosphere.  Wandering into a small town after an auto accident, to begin her new job as a church  organist, young Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) begins to pick up strange vibes: none of  the normal people in town seem to be able to see her, and she keeps being accosted by  freakish pasty-faced types who seem to be dead on their feet. The nightmarish finale  benefits from its one-of-a-kind \"found\" setting, an empty amusement park rising like a  ghostly castle from the prairie landscape.

{"description": "When Columbia Pictures sought to pair Mae West and W.C. Fields in a film, neither was thrilled, but since both stars' careers were on the skids, they agreed to the project. They fought about everything: script, billing, casting, philosophy, work habits, style. Onscreen, Fields is always the butt of his own jokes. West never is. He's all broad slapstick, she, all sly innuendo. In the film West hangs onto her precious image--that inimitable combo of sexiness and wit--as Fields systematically subverts it. It's the clash of the screen-legend titans.In the Wild West town of Greasewood, West, as Flower Belle Lee (her usual seductive saloon singer), is kidnapped by the Masked Bandit (Joseph Calleia, in a role Bogart turned down). After refusing to turn him in, she's run out of town and can only return when she's \"married and respectable.\" She meets flimflam man Cuthbert J. Twillie (Fields) on a train. He's instantly smitten: \"My heart is a bargain today, will you take me?\" \"I'll take you, and how,\" she agrees, spying his satchel of cash. Many plot twists later, Twillie's on the gallows. Hangman: \"Have you any last requests?\" Twillie: \"I'd like to see Paris before I die. Philadelphia will do.\" In her ideal happy ending, West's Flower Belle finds true love--with two men--the Masked Bandit and the town muckraker, Wayne Carter (Dick Foran).The film's funniest scenes involve Field's futile attempts to get West into a compromising position: \"I have some very definite pear-shaped ideas I'd like to discuss with thee.\" Suffice it to say that Fields ends up in bed with a goat.--Laura Mirsky", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302798434", "078322835X", "630018305X", "6300186016"], "bought_together": ["6302798434"], "also_viewed": ["6302798434"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 325922}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.87, "brand": "", "asin": "6300181294", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5196A24E18L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "My Little Chickadee [VHS]"}

{"description": "The classic science fiction novel by Ray Bradbury was a curious choice for one of the leading directors of the French New Wave, Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut. But from the opening credits onward (spoken, not written on screen), Truffaut takes Bradbury's fascinating premise and makes it his own. The futuristic society depicted inFahrenheit 451is a culture without books. Firemen still race around in red trucks and wear helmets, but their job is to start fires: they ferret out forbidden stashes of books, douse them with gasoline, and make public bonfires. Oskar Werner, the star of Truffaut'sJules and Jim, plays a fireman named Montag, whose exposure toDavid Copperfieldwakens an instinct toward reading and individual thought. (That's why books are banned--they give people too many ideas.) In an intriguing casting flourish, Julie Christie plays two roles: Montag's bored, drugged-up wife and the woman who helps kindle the spark of rebellion. The great Bernard Herrmann wrote the hard-driving music; Nicolas Roeg provided the cinematography.Fahrenheit 451received a cool critical reception and has never quite been accepted by Truffaut fans or sci-fi buffs. Its deliberately listless manner has always been a problem, although that is part of its point; the lack of reading has made people dry and empty. If the movie is a bit stiff (Truffaut did not speak English well and never tried another project in English), it nevertheless is full of intriguing touches, and the ending is lyrical and haunting.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792839846"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 113753}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.74, "brand": "MCA Universal", "asin": "6300184250", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5122B7MF89L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fahrenheit 451 [VHS]"}

{"description": "A war between the Klingons and Federation is imminent, and it's up to  Captain Kirk (William Shatner) to persuade the peaceful, agrarian planet Organia  to sign on with the good guys before the Klingons overwhelm the place. What's  the rush? Organia is in a strategically valuable position for whichever warring  side claims it first. The only problem is, the Organians don't seem to care.  Kirk and First Officer Spock (Leonard Nimoy) make an awfully good pitch for  Federation protection, but the planet's Council of Elders rejects the offer as a  tacit invitation to violence on their world. Worse, the Council takes little  heed of a Klingon invasion, insisting there is no problem and earning the enmity  of both Kirk and Klingon Commander Kor (John Colicos). Essentially a Cold War  satire disguised as a Federation-Klingon showdown in most unusual circumstances,  \"Errand of Mercy\" is the brainchild of producer-writer Gene L.

{"description": "This 1985 adventure directed by Barry Levinson (Rain Man) and written  by Chris Columbus (Gremlins) may not have much to do with the Sherlock  Holmes of Arthur Conan Doyle's invention. But it is a delightful and somewhat  unexpected combination of exciting elements: Victorian-era, foggy-London  mystique, Gothic horror, and Indiana Jones-like exotica. Nicholas Rowe plays  Holmes as a schoolboy at a boarding academy for young men. Paired with the  owlish, reticent young Watson (Alan Cox), Holmes embarks on the solution of a  mystery that involves a hallucinatory and lethal drug, and a religious cult celebrating ancient Egyptian rites of mummification. Levinson makes handsome  and crisp work of this Steven Spielberg production, without a trace of the  treacle that often found its way into other Spielbergian projects at the time  (The Goonies). Rowe is wonderfully  convincing as a teen incarnation of the Great Detective, and while Cox mostly  maintains Hollywood's traditionally unflattering idea of Watson, he does  bring warmth and comedy to the role. The cast includes Freddie Jones as an  eccentric inventor, Anthony Higgins as the villain, and Sophie Ward as  Holmes's love interest.--Tom Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 536183}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.74, "brand": "", "asin": "6300214508", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NPVMVW7WL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Young Sherlock Holmes [VHS]"}

{"description": "The era of Molly Ringwald's profitable collaboration with writer-producer-director John Hughes (Sixteen Candles,The Breakfast Club) was at its peak with this 1986 film (directed by Howard Deutch but in every sense part of the developing Hughes empire). Ringwald plays a high school girl on the budget side of the tracks, living with her warm and loving father (Harry Dean Stanton) and usually accompanied by her insecure best friend (Jon Cryer). When a wealthy but well-meaning boy (Andrew McCarthy) asks her out, her perspective is overturned and Cryer's character is threatened. As was the case in the mid-'80s, Hughes (who wrote the script and produced the film) brought his special feel for the cross-currents of adolescent life to this story. In its very commercial way, it is an honest, entertaining piece about growing pains. The attractive supporting cast (many of whom are much better known now) does a terrific job, and Ringwald and Cryer have excellent chemistry.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["630018403X", "6300183467", "6300214753", "6300214370", "0767825411", "6300213668", "6302862787", "0784011923", "B0000048S1", "6304932553", "6302765536", "6302091632", "630442972X", "6300269639", "6300215814", "6302824729", "6301570723", "B00000490M", "B00000JGEI", "0783216084", "0790731436", "6305814694", "6303344224", "6300183181", "B00005B6ND", "0800109481", "6300263673", "0783220804", "6303236863", "B000059XVO", "B00023BLXA", "6303540082", "6301827732", "6302374189", "6301966988", "B0000BWVBD", "B00006G8LB", "B00008DZ83", "B000059XY5", "6303212379", "6304263457", "6300215695", "630362572X", "B000055YW4", "6301412761", "6303123244", "6304209266", "6304773366", "B000R3KOWE"], "bought_together": ["630018403X", "6300183467"], "also_viewed": ["B001AEF6BI", "6300183467", "0790742322", "6304718551", "6303212379", "6300214540", "6301412761", "6300182207", "0767825411", "6302814782", "B00004TWZK", "630339406X", "6300263673", "6300213005", "6300214370", "6304509154", "6300213986", "6300182916"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 255262}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.45, "brand": "", "asin": "6300214710", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516554BJ34L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pretty in Pink [VHS]"}

Stallone gives the picture the pumped-up Rocky treatment, and completely misses the dance-floor excitement ofSaturday Night Fever. Travolta tries to recapture his signature role, but this is one of the movies that put his career into its pre-Pulp Fictiondeep freeze.

{"description": "Writer-director Alan Parker's feature debutBugsy Maloneis a pastiche of American movies, a musical gangster comedy set in 1929, featuring prohibition, showgirls, and gang warfare, with references to everything fromSome Like It HottoThe Godfather. Uniquely, though, all the parts are played by children, including an excellent if underused Jodie Foster as platinum-blonde singer Tallulah, Scott Baio in the title role and a nine-year-old Dexter Fletcher wielding a baseball bat.  Cream-firing \"spluge guns\" sidestep any real violence and the movie climaxes cheerfully with the biggest custard pie fight this side ofCasino Royale(1967).Unfortunately for a musical, Paul Williams's score--part honky-tonk jazz homage, part 1970s Elton John-style pop--lets the side down with a lack of memorable tunes. Nevertheless, Parker's direction is spot on and the look of the film is superb, a fantasy movie-movie existing in the same parallel reality asThe Cotton ClubandChicago. A rare British love letter to classic American cinema,Bugsy Maloneremains a true original; in Parker's words \"the work of a madman\" and one of the strangest yet most stylish children's films ever made.--Gary S.

{"description": "In the tradition of such obsessively driven directors as Erich von Stroheim and Werner Herzog, Francis Ford Coppola approached the production ofApocalypse Nowas if it were his own epic mission into the heart of darkness. On location in the storm-ravaged Philippines, he quite literally went mad as the project threatened to devour him in a vortex of creative despair, but from this insanity came one of the greatest films ever made. It began as a John Milius screenplay, transposing Joseph Conrad's classic story \"Heart of Darkness\" into the horrors of the Vietnam War, following a battle-weary Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) on a secret upriver mission to find and execute the renegade Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has reverted to a state of murderous and mystical insanity. The journey is fraught with danger involving wartime action on epic and intimate scales. One measure of the film's awesome visceral impact is the number of sequences, images, and lines of dialogue that have literally burned themselves into our cinematic consciousness, from the Wagnerian strike of helicopter gunships on a Vietnamese village to the brutal murder of stowaways on a peasant sampan and the unflinching fearlessness of the surfing warrior Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who speaks lovingly of \"the smell of napalm in the morning.\" Like Herzog'sAguirre: The Wrath of God, this film is the product of genius cast into a pit of hell and emerging, phoenix-like, in triumph. Coppola's obsession (effectively detailed in the riveting documentaryHearts of Darkness, directed by Coppola's wife, Eleanor) informs every scene and every frame, and the result is a film for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301115430", "630018627X", "0790701251", "6300183211", "6303686796", "6305363668", "079284646X", "6304935811", "0784011923", "6303953425", "0792836510", "6302822688", "B000003KHS", "630021639X", "6304119046", "B00003CXE6", "6302610702", "0792158261", "B000K7VHQE", "6303036570", "6303020089", "6303651488", "0800125762", "B004LWZW9W", "B00000JGEI", "0790705141", "6302360978", "6302415853", "0783107986", "B00005ATQA", "630336568X", "0790731975", "6305095566", "6300216500", "6301662954", "6302921058", "6300246965", "6300182878", "0800100832", "B00005JKEC", "6304286961", "B000062XM6", "0784011575", "630197154X", "B00004TYS8", "B00004WIDB", "6304414099", "0800116917", "6302517036", "0800199421", "6304259131", "0783202253", "6303109950", "6303313345", "B00006C7G9", "0792837312", "6302482712", "6300213986", "6303421563", "6304039549", "B000065U6Q", "B0000A36J1", "6300182770", "B00004CNR5", "6304025831", "6303422020", "0790748169", "0800132009"], "bought_together": ["6301115430", "0790701251"], "also_viewed": ["6303953425", "6305363668", "6305750750", "B00000J2KZ", "6303506291", "6303314015"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 172447}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6300214826", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EFVS37MRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Apocalypse Now [VHS]"}

Plenty of support, however, from the likes of Roy Kinnear (Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory) and Dame Edith Evans (Tom Jones), the handsome production is directed by veteran Ronald Neame (The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie).--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303824358", "6300156451", "B001E4TDR2", "6301967275", "0780630084", "6303953832"], "bought_together": ["6303824358", "B001E4TDR2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 354256}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.89, "brand": "", "asin": "6300251004", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71NG0FAY1NL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Scrooge [VHS]"}

Alice (voiced by Kathryn Beaumont) has all the anticipated experiences: shrinking and growing, meeting the White Rabbit, having tea with the Mad Hatter, etc. Characterization is very strong, and the Disney team worked hard to bring screen personality to Carroll's eccentric creations.

{"description": "Western Unionis nominally one of those epic celebrations of great pioneer achievements, and its official heroes are an Eastern-bred, Harvard-trained engineer named Blake (Robert Young) and a visionary named Creighton (Dean Jagger), who dreams of a transcontinental telegraph system to unite a divided nation in the first year of the Civil War. But the film really belongs to Randolph Scott's Vance Shaw, a reformed outlaw trying to make good as a member of the team stringing \"the singing wire\" across the plains. His past--which Creighton knows something of--keeps reaching out for him, so that the brightly colored fable of westward progress is almost eclipsed by the darker, personal drama of embattled character and divided loyalties.Although this theme faintly recalls director Fritz Lang's towering 1937 fable of injustice,You Only Live Once, we shouldn't make too much of the affinity.Western Unionwas merely a studio assignment, and Lang--a passionate explorer and student of the American West--mostly concentrated on serving up lashings of period detail and atmosphere and devising spectacular set pieces. The latter include a mini-g&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung of a forest fire, two strikingly composed encounters with Indians, and a climactic barbershop shootout that's studded with Lang \"touches.\" The scenery is magnificent (albeit a mite mountainous for Nebraska!), the Technicolor blazes as Technicolor should, and the costuming and art direction are so evocative that the German &eacute;migr&eacute; proudly received a commendation from an old timers' association praising the accuracy of his frontier re-creation.--Richard T.

{"description": "Troubled twentysomething Craig Sheffer is haunted by violent dreams of serial killings and nocturnal invitations by misshapen creatures who live in a misty, mysterious land called Midia. Adapted and directed by Clive Barker (Hellraiser) from his novel Cabal, this tribute to the magical creatures of the night plays like a Jungian reinterpretation of classic myths with a modern twist. Nightbreed are the dead reborn as monsters of legend, fantasies, and nightmares who form their own outcast society in an underground city beneath an Alberta graveyard. Visionary horror director David Cronenberg steps in front of the camera to play Sheffer's unscrupulous psychiatrist, an eerie, unsettling character whose dark side is hidden under a soft-spoken manner and an eerily calm and controlled voice.\n\nBarker has a rather unsubtle approach to this fantastical Holocaust metaphor: every human is a victim, a hick, or a bloodthirsty monster, and the climactic witch-hunt is all gore and spectacle. By contrast the bestial society of outcasts has a kind of natural, innocent savagery that turns protective when the tribe is threatened. Cool-looking beings of bright colors, latex masks, and outrageous bodysuits, they band together like some extreme mutant superhero team with anger-management issues. Barker could use more attention to details (what happened to the so-called mystic properties of his shape-shifting monster heroes when the guns were drawn?), but there's an undeniable charge to his modern take on myth and magic. --Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000066X4", "0783112572", "B00023NRSM", "0792839234", "6305095566", "6301327845", "B003TX8Q6K", "B00000IQUT"], "also_viewed": ["B003RZ1XGA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 390461}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.24, "brand": "", "asin": "630168740X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21RQT1BWGAL.jpg", "title": "Night Breed [VHS]"}
{"description": "Reviled by critics and embraced by the public during its initial run (1981),Porky'sis interesting to watch after all these years. What holds up about this horny coming-of-age tale is remarkable. Writer/director Bob Clark has little more than sex and practical joking on his mind, and his high school seniors from Angel Beach, Florida, rapidly move from one to the other. Clark displays a sense of timing and, perhaps rarer still, a sense of male friendship--its brutalities and its bonds--that feels right, not artificial. Surprisingly, the showcase practical jokes are still funny: the Everglades encounter with Cherry Forever, the hole in the girls' shower, and Beulah Balbricker, the humongous gym teacher. The comedic set-ups and payoffs surprisingly still work. Clark's insistence on a subplot about anti-Semitism, however, still sticks out as A MESSAGE. Kim Cattrall really got her start here (although almost no one else did) as Ms. Honeywell, a.k.a. \"Lassie.\" Clark later distanced himself from the irritatingPorky'ssequels and went on to make the wonderfulChristmas Story, the tale of a little boy who wants a BB gun for Christmas.--Keith Simanton", "related": {"bought_together": ["630240424X"], "also_viewed": ["B000O76ZNU", "B000056BSE", "B004INAKS2", "630240424X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 396986}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.24, "brand": "", "asin": "6301697286", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41AXZEWVH2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Porky's [VHS]"}

{"description": "Sergei Eisenstein's revolutionary sophomore feature has so long stood as a textbook example of montage editing that many have forgotten what an invigoratingly cinematic experience he created. A 20th-anniversary tribute to the 1905 revolution, Eisenstein portrays the revolt in microcosm with a dramatization of the real-life mutiny aboard the battleshipPotemkin. The story tells a familiar party-line message of the oppressed working class (in this case the enlisted sailors) banding together to overthrow their oppressors (the ship's officers), led by proto-revolutionary Vakulinchuk. When he dies in the shipboard struggle the crew lays his body to rest on the pier, a moody, moving scene where the citizens of Odessa slowly emerge from the fog to pay their respects. As the crowd grows Eisenstein turns the tenor from mourning a fallen comrade to celebrating the collective achievement. The government responds by sending soldiers and ships to deal with the mutinous crew and the supportive townspeople, which climaxes in the justly famous (and often imitated and parodied) Odessa Steps massacre. Eisenstein edits carefully orchestrated motions within the frame to create broad swaths of movement, shots of varying length to build the rhythm, close-ups for perspective and shock effect, and symbolic imagery for commentary, all to create one of the most cinematically exciting sequences in film history. Eisenstein's film is Marxist propaganda to be sure, but the power of this masterpiece lies not in its preaching but its poetry.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 523393}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6301815807", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21JVPR6MGVL.jpg", "title": "Battleship Potemkin [VHS]"}

{"description": "Annie Hallis one of the truest, most bittersweet romances on film. In it, Allen plays a thinly disguised version of himself: Alvy Singer, a successful--if neurotic--television comedian living in Manhattan. Annie (the wholesomely luminous Dianne Keaton) is a Midwestern transplant who dabbles in photography and sings in small clubs. When the two meet, the sparks are immediate--if repressed. Alone in her apartment for the first time, Alvy and Annie navigate a minefield of self-conscious \"is-this-person-someone-I'd-want-to-get-involved-with?\" conversation. As they speak, subtitles flash their unspoken thoughts: the likes of \"I'm not smart enough for him\" and \"I sound like a jerk.\" Despite all their caution, they connect, and we're swept up in the flush of their new romance. Allen's antic sensibility shines here in a series of flashbacks to Alvy's childhood, growing up, quite literally, under a rumbling roller coaster. His boisterous Jewish family's dinner table shares a split screen with the WASP-y Hall's tight-lipped holiday table, one Alvy has joined for the first time. His position as outsider is uncontestable he looks down the table and sizes up Annie's \"Grammy Hall\" as \"a classic Jew-hater.\"The relationship arcs, as does Annie's growing desire for independence. It quickly becomes clear that the two are on separate tracks, as what was once endearing becomes annoying.Annie Hallembraces Allen's central themes--his love affair with New York (and hatred of Los Angeles), how impossible relationships are, and his fear of death. But their balance is just right, the chemistry between Allen's worry-wart Alvy and Keaton's gangly, loopy Annie is one of the screen's best pairings. It couldn't be more engaging.--Susan Benson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792837207", "6301971922", "6302718910", "6300216365", "B000NNOYH4", "6301972147", "B00000GJ2B", "B0000040EL", "630146494X", "6301964365", "6302610702", "6304508557", "0792837096", "0783217528", "6301734734", "1558807780", "6301404440", "6304196806", "6300271870", "6302278929", "6304112254", "0790741067", "630339406X", "0800113055", "0800135954", "6300181367", "6300181340", "6304429274", "0783221347", "B00007E2F6", "6301797957", "6300182320", "6302305950"], "bought_together": ["6301971922"], "also_viewed": ["6301971922", "0792846052", "6303506291"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 222206}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.77, "brand": "", "asin": "6301963911", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5178RVKAYEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Annie Hall [VHS]"}
{"description": "Walker (Lee Marvin) strides through Los Angeles with the steel-eyed stare of a stone-cold killer, or perhaps a ghost. Betrayed by his wife and best friend, who gun him down point-blank and leave him for dead after a successful heist, Walker blasts his way up the criminal food chain in a quest for revenge. Did he survive the shooting or return from the grave, or is it all a dying dream? The question is left in the air in John Boorman's modern film noir, a brutal revenge thriller based on Richard Stark's novelThe Hunter(remade by Brian Helgeland asPayback), set in the impersonal concrete and steel canyons of Los Angeles and eerily empty cells of Alcatraz. Walker kills without remorse, guided by shadowy \"informant\" Keenan Wynn, whose own agenda is carefully concealed, and assisted by Angie Dickinson, as he desperately searches for someone, anyone, who can just give him his money. But if Walker is an extreme incarnation of the revenge-driven noir antihero, the modern syndicate has been transformed into a world of paper jungles and corporate businessmen, an alienating concept to the two-fisted, gun-wielding gangster. Boorman creates a hard, austere look for the film and fragments the story with flashes of painful memory, grafting the New Wave onto old genres with confidence and style. Haunting and brutal,Point Blankremains one of the most distinctive crime thrillers ever made.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302752329", "6300269035", "6302032237", "6300251217", "6304508557", "0792841484", "6300181723", "6302413400", "B00005LCAQ", "630197204X", "6301967909", "6300182878", "B00004STJA", "0792110269", "0790733897"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 389970}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6301971876", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21AB3CJQT6L.jpg", "title": "Point Blank [VHS]"}

{"description": "The second half of this 1943 Technicolor musical is an excuse for MGM's contract talent to perform songs and sketches in a big show at an Army base. Unfortunately, more than an hour passes before the show arrives, stranding the viewer with a thin service comedy about an opera singer (Kathryn Grayson) tagging along to a military camp in hopes of reuniting her estranged parents, whose names are Bill and Hillary (no comments, please). Romance comes in the form of private Gene Kelly, a former trapeze artist who misses the glory of his former life. Grayson warbles, and Kelly has one nifty solo dance (with a mop and broom), but the all-star revue is the movie's main attraction. The song selection is generally poor (\"I Dug a Ditch in Wichita\" is performed twice), with Lena Horne's sultry take on \"Honeysuckle Rose\" an exception. She's backed by Benny Carter and His Orchestra. Specialty player Virginia O'Brien delights with one of her deadpan numbers, Eleanor Powell tap dances, and Judy Garland delivers with a boogie-woogie lilt on \"Jumpin' Down at Carnegie Hall.\" Comedy sketches with Red Skelton and Frank Morgan are stubbornly unfunny. Then there's  Jos&eacute; Iturbi, the Spanish-born conductor, making his film debut at the  beginning of his run as MGM's supposedly cute highbrow. Director George Sidney  would team up two years later with Iturbi, Kelly, and Grayson inAnchors Aweigh, a much more enjoyable musical confection.--Robert Horton", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 229119}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Thousands Cheer [VHS]", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301980719", "6303209890", "6305562784", "6301965639", "6302341116", "6304296975", "6302077834"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514Q62G8T9L._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "6301975979"}

Written by Ernest Lehman and Clifford Odets (who based the Hunsecker character on the similarly brutal and power-mad Walter Winchell), the film follows Falco's attempts to promote a client through Hunsecker's column--until he is forced to make a deal with the devil and help Hunsecker ruin a jazz musician who has the nerve to date Hunsecker's sister.

Adapted from the novel by Rafael Sabatini (who also pennedThe Sea Hawk), this rousing adventure chronicles the travails of Peter Blood (Flynn), a righteous doctor unjustly sold into slavery for treating the wounds of rebels, a kind of British Dr. Mudd. Sent to a Jamaican plantation where he toils under the brutal whip of Lionel Atwill and seethes with passion for his fair niece (the astonishingly beautiful Olivia de Havilland), he escapes from bondage with his fellow prisoners and becomes the gentleman rogue pirate of the Caribbean. Director Michael Curtiz builds from one set piece to another, including a nimble beachside sword fight with pirate nemesis Basil Rathbone and climaxing with a grand sea battle that belies the film's modest budget. Flynn's bravado and charisma are apparent from his entrance, but once he leaps into action he takes command of the picture, overcoming his still-green dramatic skills with sheer personality.Captain Bloodmade stars of Flynn and de Havilland and catapulted Curtiz to the top ranks of Warner directors.

{"description": "In 1964 director Billy Wilder was at the top of his game. Following a string of hits that had begun in 1959 withSome Like It Hot, he now intended to direct a bawdy boudoir farce in the grand tradition of the French theater. The contorted plot involves one Orville J. Spooner, an aspiring song writer (originally to be played by Peter Sellers, but replaced by Ray Walston after Sellers suffered a heart attack, which he partly blamed on Wilder), and his crazed lyricist, buddy Barney Milsap. Together they toil away in the town of Climax, Nevada, Orville working as a piano teacher and Barney pumping gas across the street. Along comes Dean Martin, playing a thinly veiled caricature of himself, who just wants to fill up his tank. Instead, the songwriting duo rig his car so he's forced to spend the night at Orville's, giving the dolts a chance to pitch their songs. But Dino also wants Orville's wife. No problem! They hire Polly the Pistol (Kim Novak), the local prostitute, to masquerade as her. Thus begin the high jinks. The film plays like an extended dirty joke that could have been told around the office water cooler in 1960. It was a colossal failure both critically and commercially, and was banned by the Catholic League of Decency, to boot. Nonetheless, the film has aged well and was ahead of its time (think of it as the grandfather ofCaddyshackand the great-grandfather ofThere's Something About Mary). Wilder eventually renounced the film and moved on.--Kristian St. Clair", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 520413}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.93, "brand": "", "asin": "630224112X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TEEA0RFPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Kiss Me Stupid [VHS]"}

The story centers on a pre-World  War&nbsp;II stunt pilot (Bill Campbell) who accidentally comes into possession of a rocket-propelled backpack much coveted by the Nazis.

{"description": "British thespian and sophomore director Kenneth Branagh follows up his adaptation of Shakespeare'sHenry Vwith this abrupt change of pace, a slick, stylish thriller evocative of Hitchcock, classic film noir, and gothic shockers. Sporting an exaggerated American accent, Branagh stars as L.A. private eye Mike Church, a hard-boiled but softhearted detective who takes on the case of a mysterious amnesiac (Branagh's then-real-life wife, Emma Thompson). With the help of an offbeat furniture dealer and part-time hypnotist (Derek Jacobi), Grace (as Mike has named her) dredges up her hidden memories. Little do they realize that her recollections are of a past life in L.A.'s recent history, and as she recounts the details of a famous marriage that ended with a notorious murder (played out as black-and-white flashbacks starring Branagh and Thompson), events of the present begin to mirror the past, as if fate were pulling the two into fatal replay of history. Branagh's flashy, flourished direction echoes with an array of '40s and '50s classics and near classics (most notably Hitchcock'sRebeccaandSpellbound) and drives the story with an edgy urgency, all the better to distract from some of the sillier elements of the plot. But while this film may not make literal sense in the harsh light of day, in the twilit, shadowy world of classic Hollywood this slyly inventive thriller is a bravura bit of old-fashioned entertainment, done up with modern flair.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302482712"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 336608}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6302289009", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H8X0SC52L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dead Again [VHS]"}

{"description": "Australian model George Lazenby took up the mantle of the world's most suave secret agent when Sean Connery retired as James Bond--prematurely, it turned out. Connery returned inDiamonds Are Foreverbefore leaving the role to Roger Moore and Lazenby's subsequent career fizzled, yet this one-hit wonder is responsible for one of the best Bond films of all time.InOn Her Majesty's Secret Service, 007 leaves the Service to privately  pursue his SPECTRE nemesis Blofeld (played this time by Telly Savalas), whose latest master plan involves a threat to the world's crops by agricultural sterilization. Bond teams up with suave international crime lord Draco (Gabriele Ferzetti) and falls in love with--and marries--his elegant daughter, Tracy (Diana Rigg). Bond goes monogamous? Not at first; after all he has Blofeld's harem to seduce. Lazenby hasn't the intensity of Connery but he has fun with his quips and even lampoons the Bond image in a playful pre-credits sequence, and Rigg, fresh from playing sexy Emma Peel inThe Avengers, matches 007 in every way.

Clifton James, the redneck sheriff fromLive and Let Die, makes an embarrassing and ill-advised appearance as a racist tourist who briefly teams up with 007 in what is otherwise the film's highlight, a high-energy chase through the crowded streets of Bangkok that climaxes with a breathtaking midair corkscrew jump.

Gregory Peck is a hotshot magazine writer who has been blind to the problem; to ferret it out, he passes himself off as Jewish and watches the WASPs squirm. Seen a half-century later, the attitudes seem quaint and dated: Could it really have been like this? Yet the truth of the story comes through, in the wounded dignity of John Garfield, the upright indignation of Peck, and the hidden ways bigotry and hatred can poison relationships.

{"description": "This black-and-white film adaptation of Tennessee Williams's Southern gothic play is perhaps more famous for the rumored off-screen shenanigans of its stars than for its over-the-top repressed sexuality (only Williams could pull off that paradox, and pull it off he does). Supposedly, stars Katharine Hepburn and Elizabeth Taylor battled for screen time; Hepburn warred very publicly with director Joseph Mankiewicz; and a postaccident Montgomery Clift relied heavily on painkillers and support from friend Taylor during the grueling shoot. Even this, however, cannot top the events of the film itself, revolving around the unseen playboy Sebastian and his mysterious death, which has something to do with young boys, a decadent European vacation, and Taylor in a provocative wet, white bathing suit. To give away the plot would spoil the fun, but suffice it to say that what Taylor saw was so horrible it drove her nuts, and Sebastian's mother (Hepburn) wants her to have a lobotomy in order to keep it from coming out; Clift is brought in to do the procedure. It's all a hoot and a holler, but as played by the two leading ladies (both of whom nabbed Oscar nominations), it's also compelling, chilling, and utterly gothic. Taylor gives a fierce performance, as the climaxing monologue that reveals Sebastian's \"secret\" rests entirely on her shoulders, and Hepburn plays brilliantly against type as Sebastian's manipulating, overbearing mother. Only Clift, saddled with a dreary character in charge of plot exposition, fails to deliver.

A crowd of men ogles her as she tosses off a saucy little number, \"They Call Me Sister Honky Tonk,\" swinging her hips phlegmatically. Then she slithers offstage, muttering \"Suckers.\" Bored with life, Tira consults a fortuneteller. \"I see a man in your future,\" he drones. \"What, only one?\" quips Mae. Tira wants to quit the carnival, so her boss (an unctuous Edward Arnold) makes her a proposition.

Enter Cary Grant as Jack Clayton, an aristocrat who falls for this floozie from the wrong side of the tracks. Some of the film's merriest scenes show Tira and her five black maids having a ball dancing and singing as she prepares for her dates with Jack.

{"description": "This sequel to the Oscar-winning horror film based on the novel by William Peter Blatty was virtually laughed off the screen when it came out in 1977. It was an unintentionally hilarious mishmash and received such terrible reviews that director John Boorman yanked it out of theaters. He reedited it, cutting eight minutes in hopes of getting the story (written by William Goodhart) to the point of coherency, to no avail. The film remains a kind of reverse gold standard for sequels. It's still a ridiculously overacted, although at times visually haunting, movie. Richard Burton stars as a troubled priest (something of a specialty of his) who is brought in to follow up on the case of Linda Blair, who is institutionalized, still troubled by her encounter with the devil (who wouldn't be?).

The cast is outstanding, the cinematography by  Conrad Hall stunning, and the climax one of Huston's most painfully memorable. The story is filled out by surrounding detail that never leaves the memory: boxers and trainers who whisper of injuries that could put them out of business for good; a lone fighter who takes a bus into town, bides time in a crummy motel room, takes a beating in the ring, then leaves on the next bus with a few dollars in his pocket.

{"description": "\"Peanuts\" creator Charles Schulz retired from the cartoonist's life  early in 2000, and indeed left a few loose strings hanging among his  chronically dissatisfied characters. He never did, for instance, cut Charlie  Brown much slack in the romance department (or let him kick Lucy's football,  for that matter). Sympathetic readers might have taken note of a story in the  press just before Schulz said farewell, in which the inspiration for Charlie  Brown's unrequited love interest--the never-seen, too-distant, \"little  red-haired girl\"--was identified as a woman who turned down a marriage  proposal from Schultz a half-century ago. That bit of biographical detail now  adds poignancy toBe My Valentine, Charlie Brown, a 1975 television  special built upon years of Valentine's Day \"Peanuts\" strips. This  half-hour show finds Charlie Brown suffering, typically, the ignominy of  receiving no hearts-and-flowers greetings while the rest of the gang,  including Snoopy, spend their day sorting through piles of love notes. Worse,  Schulz's famous sad sack can't get up the nerve to approach his  unapproachable angel, though there may be--justmay be--a glimmer of hope this time around.

Whether or not the scenario sticks in the memory, what does linger are the unique effects, which are not quite like anything else. Plenty of good fairy-tale characters and memorable scenes, and the film even encourages kids to read.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000006FS3", "6303212379", "B00000JPH5", "6302642256", "6304291361", "B00005RRG6", "1558807381", "B00000JPH4", "0767825411", "B00005LL26", "6304509154", "B00005OLY5", "B00000JMQC", "B00065GWMO", "6301179552", "6300184080", "0790700506", "6300270122", "B00006AL1C", "B0000A36J1", "6304089627", "B00000JKNP", "B00003CXXI", "B000065U6Q"], "bought_together": ["B000006FS3", "6304291361"], "also_viewed": ["B000BPL2GK", "6303212379", "0140386335", "6304434340", "6304291361", "B000006FS3", "B00004R99N", "0790742322", "0790700506", "0788812408", "5554458521", "6305093016", "630339406X", "B00005OLY5", "6302091632", "B001AGXEAG", "B00003CXXI", "6303534422", "B00001IVED", "6303828035", "6304718551", "6302787068", "B00006HBUC", "6300183467", "B00005O5ML", "B00000JPH5", "6304400551", "0767825411", "B00000JKNP", "6301136527", "630341964X", "B000A468XY", "6302961572", "6301390725", "6300275310", "6303614493", "6303314015", "6303326781", "B0007A2GSM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 265174}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6303212395", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B67839S3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The NeverEnding Story [VHS]"}
{"description": "THE DEVIL AT 4 O'CLOCK is a disaster flick with a star-studded cast. Spencer Tracy stars as a priest who has lost his faith and has become an alcoholic. He is to be replaced by a new cleric on the South Seas island on which he works, arriving on a plane carrying three manacled convicts (Frank Sinatra, Gregoire Aslan, and Bernie Hamilton) on their way to prison on the main island of Tahiti. Tracy asks for permission to have the convicts help him finish the chapel at the island's hospital for children with leprosy, but, as they work, a series of earthquakes signal that the island's slumbering volcano might be waking. Finally, a huge quack erupts and the island's inhabitants prepare to evacuate, leaving Tracy, Sinatra, and company the responsibility of escorting the lepers to safety, a task that requires chaperoning them down the mountain, through the jungle, and out to the last evacuation boat before it departs at 4:00 sharp. The dark tale also includes a romantic element featuring Barbara Luna as a blind woman whom Sinatra can't refuse.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AMDA2OY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 230283}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.44, "brand": "", "asin": "6303257224", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PCH5QMZAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Devil at 4 O'Clock [VHS]"}

{"description": "Boaz Yakin's astounding debut feature looks at the violent world of the projects through the eyes of a 12-year-old drug runner. Sean Nelson delivers a quiet but intense performance as Michael--street name Fresh--a cynical but introspective kid grown up fast and hard on the killing streets of the projects. Samuel L. Jackson costars as Fresh's estranged father, a speed chess hustler in the city park whose dispassionate philosophy--the chess board as life--becomes the film's central metaphor, as Fresh plots a brilliant, coldly brutal plan to save himself and his junkie sister from his world of drug dealers and street violence. Yakin's assured direction delivers a vividly realized world in bold, crisp images and an austere but poetic style that captures the dispassionate point of view of a heart-hardened adolescent street survivor. The excellent score by former Police-man  Stewart Copeland, his most haunting sinceRumblefish, mixes smooth symphonic sounds with bluesy guitars and syncopated percussion, giving the soundtrack the same sad intimacy as Yakin's visuals. The world of Fresh is alive with danger that  threatens to extinguish all the wonder and joy of childhood--the film's most devastating moment observes Fresh helplessly trying to stop the bleeding of a schoolmate, a girl he has a crush on, caught by a stray bullet from a senseless playground murder. As Fresh loses his innocence playing street thugs and drug dealers like pieces on a chess board, he becomes the greatest victim of all.--Sean Axmaker", "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 484032}, "asin": "6303354912", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y7J3SPECL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fresh [VHS]"}

Based on true events, Troisi plays a shy postman who strikes up an unlikely friendship with exiled Chilean poet Pablo Neruda (Philippe Noiret). Through Neruda's example and tutelage, the hero learns to think of his Italian fishing village in lyrical terms, as well as how to talk to women and even find the strength to take his political stands.

Anne (Amanda Root) is captivated when she meets the dignified naval officer Capt. Wentworth (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds), but she is advised to discourage his romantic overtures because he has no fortune. They meet again eight years later, but now Capt. Wentworth has become wealthy while Anne's father is in reduced circumstances in the wake of reckless extravagance. A series of circumstances ensue which prevent Anne and Wentworth from expressing their mutual and inevitable love.

{"description": "InIndependence Day, a scientist played by Jeff Goldblum once actually had a fistfight with a man (Bill Pullman) who is now president of the United States. That same president, late in the film, personally flies a jet fighter to deliver a payload of missiles against an attack by extraterrestrials.Independence Dayis the kind of movie so giddy with its own outrageousness that one doesn't even blink at such howlers in the plot. Directed by Roland Emmerich,Independence Dayis a pastiche of conventions from flying-saucer movies from the 1940s and 1950s, replete with icky monsters and bizarre coincidences that create convenient shortcuts in the story. (Such as the way the girlfriend of one of the film's heroes--played by Will Smith--just happens to run across the president's injured wife, who are then both rescued by Smith's character who somehow runs across them in alien-ravaged Los Angeles County.) The movie is just sheer fun, aided by a cast that knows how to balance the retro requirements of the genre with a more contemporary feel.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303148352", "6301792734", "6302610702", "6304169558", "B00005JKZ2", "B00007JME0", "0800132009", "B0002MB7R6", "6305169187", "080010367X", "6303257844", "6300215830", "B000062XM6"], "bought_together": ["6303148352"], "also_viewed": ["0800125762", "080010367X", "6300213668", "6303049079", "6303257844", "6304169558", "630382790X", "B00000JGEI", "6305169187", "6300214060", "6301792734", "0792116887", "6304089767", "B0002MB7R6", "B00003CX8I", "6304290888", "B000062XM6", "0792107128", "B00005B238", "630339406X", "B00000IQV1", "6302936381", "155890641X", "6302415853", "6303506291", "6301796535", "6301208773", "B000006FYP", "6305750750", "6302516986", "0792151712", "0767825411", "6302642248", "6301963725", "6303215734", "080018789X", "6303614493", "6303675220", "B00005JM5E", "6304500831", "B000096IB6", "B00000K3AN", "6302091632", "0783229011", "B0087F7VSY", "B00HF98SJY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 266473}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6304233639", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71TEN1TNW7L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Independence Day [VHS]"}

Moving in with some half-savage relatives on a country farm, Flora is hardly daunted by their primitivism (as she might have been in a novel by Thomas Hardy) but instead takes charge and imposes hygiene, order, and good manners on the dirty, superstitious lot.

{"description": "After years of enduring Roger Moore in the role of James Bond, it was good to have Sean Connery back in this 1983 film for a one-time-only trip down 007's memory lane. Connery's Bond, a bit of a dinosaur in the British secret service at (then) 52, is still in demand during times of crisis. Sadly, the film is not very good. In this rehash ofThunderball, Bond is pitted against a worthy underwater villain (Klaus Maria Brandauer); and while the requisite Bond Girls include beauties Kim Basinger and Barbara Carrera, they can't save the movie. The script has several truly dumb passages, among them a (gasp) video-game duel between 007 and his nemesis that now looks utterly anachronistic. For Connery fans, however, this widescreen print of the Irvin Kershner (The Empire Strikes Back) film is a chance to say a final goodbye to a perfect marriage of actor and character.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000NDEXPM", "B000M53GMW", "B000RPCK24", "B001R10BN2", "6302380596", "630238060X", "B000RPCK1U", "6302510198", "B000RPCK1A", "6302510031", "6303651461", "B00004TYS8", "6303651488", "6302510015", "630251018X", "6302510023", "6302510007", "B0000068SI", "B000RPCK0Q", "6302380588", "6304047843", "B00005JL0I", "B001PPLIEG", "6302380294", "B000M53GMC", "B000NIBUS0", "B00008V2VP", "630251004X", "6305784906", "B00004RWUH", "B000RPCK1K", "B000NIBUR6", "B000M53GNG", "B000M53GN6", "B00AQSN7HE", "B000M53GLS", "B001EDVNNU", "B000NIBURG", "B000M53GM2", "B000NDEXPC", "B007REV4T8", "B000NIBURQ", "B00004RG62", "6304032579", "B004BR7XLM", "6302824613", "B00004W9C7", "6301308913", "B00005LIRF", "6300216500", "630442972X", "6304508611", "6302409829", "6304674228", "6303313345", "6300216721", "B00004RG68", "6303696813", "630280096X", "6303212263", "6302360978", "B00004WZR1", "6303686796", "0792835018", "B00004RNAC", "6300181405", "630281622X", "B00000K2SO", "6304259131", "0793941520", "630105573X", "B00000F13T", "0792116887", "6302299497", "079074886X", "0792133153", "0783223218", "6302096316"], "bought_together": ["B000M53GMW", "B000NDEXPM"], "also_viewed": ["B009L6S5EC", "B00AZFECS6", "630238060X", "B00000K2SO", "6302510023", "B001AQO3U6", "6303651488"]}, "price": 17.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 507251}, "asin": "6304406096", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41bUcYAbPbL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Never Say Never Again [VHS]"}

{"description": "Hammer Studios prefigured both the explosion of Bermuda Triangle thrillers and \"lost world\" adventures with this appropriately gothic 1968 fantasy. Eric Porter stars as the brooding captain of a decrepit scow smuggling illegal explosives with a questionable crew and a desperate cadre of passengers (including Hildegard Kneff, Suzanna Leigh, and Tony Beckley) into a hurricane. The initial melodrama turns to high-seas adventure as the ship battles the storm with volatile cargo and finally to a strange, moody fantasy. The ship becomes entangled in a creeping tangle of aggressive weeds that pulls the vessel deep into a twilight world of monstrous mollusks, snakelike vines with a taste for human flesh, and an insular society descended from rogue elements of the Spanish Inquisition who prey upon the unlucky ships dragged to their hidden island. Rotting galleons set against the creepy orange sky create an unsettling, alien world, like a psychedelic spin on Jules Verne.

{"description": "Best known for making movies about men and violence, director Walter Hill scored a misfire with this ambitious but ultimately dreary remake of Akira Kurosawa's samurai classicYojimbo. The story's essentially the same but the setting has been switched to a dusty, almost ghostly Texas town in the 1930s, where two rival Chicago gangs are locked in an uneasy truce. Bruce Willis plays the lone drifter who allies himself with both gangs to his own advantage, working both sides against each other according to his own hidden agenda. The violence escalates to a bloody climax, of course, with Christopher Walken, David Patrick Kelly, and Michael Imperioli as trigger-happy lieutenants in a lonely, desolate war. Fans of gangster movies will want to see this, and, if nothing else, Hill has brought his polished style to a vaguely mythic story. It's far from being a classic, however, and although its action is at times masterfully choreographed, the movie's humorless attitude is unexpectedly oppressive.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783226888", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00562I40K", "B002AS466O", "0767807588", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B005R08HJY", "0767821513", "B000FFL2G6", "B00000JDIQ", "0780618548", "B00005JKTP", "B000XT1P4S", "B003Q6D2B4", "B009HIKAN8", "B000RETOH4", "B000QUCRB4", "B00BLF9FOK", "B002AT8K9W", "B0058ZPNBI", "0767817710", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000056PNL", "B000095WW8", "B003AWRMCE", "B000P0J0AG", "B002ZG96ZC", "B000FKO5QK", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B00008RH3L", "B002ZG999U", "B002GHHHP6", "B002VWNICC", "0767802519", "B008E70EES", "B0045HCJG2", "B0000TANUI", "B002QEHPQU", "B00005UQ9T", "B00004Y87N", "B008JFURII", "B000O78KW4", "6305263248", "B0062P3392", "B000E5N6LG", "B0010YVCB6", "B003L20IG0", "6305767866", "B0045HCJ5S", "6304711891", "B0045HCIWW", "B003ASLJIQ", "B005LAIGRS", "6304806434", "B0068MNNS0", "B00011CZRE", "B001LRJH0U", "B000BRP4BM", "B00AEFXVOI", "B000XR9L50", "B003ASLJRC", "B00BUAEYVK", "B003ASLJS6", "B003ASLJOU", "B004ULNJIU", "B00003CY5A", "B00005JLX2", "B00AEFXT1S", "B002AT8KA6", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B002FU8IWU", "B00AEBB86A", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B0007PALZ2", "1558908846", "B001UV4XGA", "B001LMAK88", "B001R3YRG2", "B00AG51V8E", "B001N44BVQ", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B005LAIILM", "B0000DI87S", "B000NOIVT0", "B002DU39GW", "B0043X1FLI", "B004A8ZX28", "B00004STDN", "B003AWRMBA", "B002GHHHME", "B00005V4XW", "B000J4QWMC", "B004EPYZOO", "B00388PK7O", "B005S9ELVC", "B001B3LIOC", "B00AS1Q93S", "B00008K76U", "B00005JLQN", "B009MF5BXK"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFYYWQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003F18008", "B0009ETCUQ", "B002GSXKNS", "B00AEFYYWQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23129}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.52, "brand": "New Line Studios", "asin": "6304698747", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TWD0Y9QDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Last Man Standing"}

Before he knows the game has even begun, Douglas is caught up in a series of unexplained events designed to strip him of his tenuous security and cast him into a maelstrom of chaos. How do you play a game that hasn't any rules? That's what Douglas has to figure out, and he can't always rely on his intelligence to form logic out of what's happening to him. Seemingly cast as the fall guy in a conspiracy thriller, he encounters a waitress (Deborah Unger) who may or may not be trustworthy, and nothing can be taken at face value in a world turned upside down. Douglas is great at conveying the sheer panic of his character's dilemma, and despite some lapses in credibility and an anticlimactic ending,The Gameremains a thinking person's thriller that grabs and holds your attention.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0784011923", "B00000JGEI", "B00003CXE6", "6303447589", "6302256615", "6304078250", "6303012140", "B00000JGEK", "6301520106", "0792838211", "0792839846", "B00003JRAB", "B000006ORX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 399710}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.98, "brand": "", "asin": "6304765789", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZCZHZE36L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Game [VHS]"}
{"description": "On his evening commute, bored accountant Sugiyama (Koji Yakusho) always looks for the beautiful woman who gazes wistfully out the window of the Kishikawa School of Dancing. One night he gets off the train, walks into the studio, and signs up for a class. Soon Sugiyama is so engrossed in his dancing he practices his steps on the train platform and under his desk, and becomes good enough for competition, compelling his wife to hire a private investigator to find out why he stays out late and returns home smelling of perfume. Among the colorful characters Sugiyama meets is his coworker Aoki (Naoto Takenaka), who transforms himself from geeky systems analyst to hilariously flamboyant (and bad-wigged) lounge lizard. Aoki explains to Sugiyama, \"When I finish work, put on the clothes, the wig and become Donny Burns, Latin world champion, and I start to move to the rhythm, I'm so happy, so completely free.\" Here lies the chief charm ofShall We Dance, the contrast between the ultracompetitive women of the studio--including the one who caught Sugiyama's eye, Mai (Tamiyo Kusakari)--and the men who dance simply because they enjoy it. This 1996 film is somewhat comparable to the flamboyant Aussie favoriteStrictly Ballroom, butShall We Danceis especially noteworthy for contrasting the boldness of social dance with the buttoned-up societal mores of Japan, where people avoid public displays of emotion. Even in Japan, the joy of dance is irresistible.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"bought_together": ["B004SIP9VA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 195577}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.9, "brand": "", "asin": "6304798466", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5116JAH4H6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Shall We Dance?

{"description": "When viewed from a cranky perspective, this by-the-book David versus Goliath story doesn't offer any surprises, and it's a bit sad to watch director Francis Coppola (who also adapted John Grisham's bestseller) squandering his once-glorious talent on such conventional Hollywood fare. In a more charitable light, however, there's great pleasure to be found in Coppola's intelligent, no-nonsense handling of a plot that's every bit as involving as it is formulaic. Coppola also knows how to bring out the best in a stellar cast, and this is the movie (released in November 1997, just a few weeks beforeGood Will Hunting) that signaled Matt Damon's arrival as a major-league star. Damon plays Rudy Baylor, a young rookie lawyer in Memphis (location of many Grisham stories) who takes on a powerful insurance company (led by shark-like lawyer Jon Voight) by representing the family of a boy who was denied potentially life-saving treatment for leukemia. Rudy also comes to the rescue of an abused wife (Claire Danes) and learns the tricks of the legal trade from a seasoned paralegal (Danny DeVito) who sees Rudy as his ticket out of the sleaze-ball practice run by a shady lawyer (Mickey Rourke). There's no mystery about where this plot is going, but Coppola takes us there in high style with a sharp script, and Damon strikes just the right note of naivete and strategic intelligence. When Goliath inevitably falls, this courtroom David wins fair and square.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304259131", "6302935148", "0790748169", "B00020HABA", "B00003CXTF", "6305622825", "6305718792", "6303269834", "0792133153", "0783221347", "B00007CVYA", "6303313345", "6300183211", "B00004WIDB", "0790701251", "6302945089", "B00000IO4G"], "bought_together": ["6304259131"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 362387}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.24, "brand": "", "asin": "6304925131", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51362Y4QKQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rainmaker [VHS]"}
{"description": "During the 10 years betweenNight of the Living DeadandDawn of the Dead, director George Romero had a string of box-office flops--some of which were actually quite good. For example,there'sThe Crazies, in which a military plane carrying biological-warfare agents crashes near Evans City, Pennsylvania. The virus gets into the town's water supply and has two effects on the infected: death or irreversible insanity. The military moves in to contain the situation, but the local populace regards the army as a menacing force and things rapidly spin out of control. Soon the highly contagious virus infects the whole town and the soldiers as well, while a government scientist races to find an antidote.The Craziesfeatures some great set pieces as the virus spreads: a little old lady smiles sweetly and stabs a soldier to death with a knitting needle; a young woman placidly sweeps with a broom while soldiers and locals have a bloody firefight around her; a soldier swings his rifle wildly at his comrades until they shoot him.Made in the shadow of both Vietnam and Watergate,The Craziescontains plenty of allegory: an invasion by military force, government cover-up and duplicity, madness and eventually genocide (all set, of course, in Romero's beloved Pennsylvania). The President only appears on television, and then only the back of his head is shown as he speaks in detached, almost bored tones. LikeNight of the Living Dead, this film offers no hope, no comfort, and sure as hell no happy ending. Keep an eye out for Romero in a somewhat gassy role as Evans City's mayor.--Jerry Renshaw", "price": 7.89, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 622083}, "asin": "6304983786", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NA3QCSZFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Crazies [VHS]"}

{"description": "An economic crisis brings unemployed Nada (Roddy Piper) to L.A. in search of work.  What he finds instead is that the ruling elite of the world are aliens in disguise, their aim being to keep humans in a state of mindless consumerism.  His discovery comes when he dons a pair of special sunglasses made by a resistance group and sees for the first time reality unadorned.  Billboards, store signs, magazine covers--all bear subliminal messages to OBEY, to CONSUME, to have NO INDEPENDENT THOUGHT.  Money itself says THIS IS YOUR GOD. But worst of all, with these glasses you see which of us are really hideous, bug-eyed aliens.  The conceptual breakthrough is hilarious while keeping its roots in darker matters.  Although some fault the film for settling into its action plot, the ending has a great payoff. And the direction by John Carpenter is handled with superb workmanlike aplomb. One unforgettable set piece has Piper in a back-alley fistfight with a friend who won't put on the glasses that goes on and on, and just when you think it's over it goes another round. One of the most subversive films ever made in Hollywood,They Livewas released on the eve of the 1988 elections.

{"description": "Father Vassey (Michael Rooker) has a problem.  Using his two 9mm, laser-sighted cannons he's tracked down and killed the holders of a heretic ceremony meant to bring a demon into the world.  Not just any demon, this one's raison d'etre is nothing less than uncreating creation.  The problem is that Vassey is too late.  The demon has manifested, escaped, and is now on the hunt for the soul of a young boy who is believed to be a saint, due to the stigmata he had at birth. The film is directed by Jamie Dixon, heretofore a special effects supervisor, who shows canny restraint where special effects are concerned. The shadowy demon of the title is depicted often by a fluid black cloud, which is functional without losing its eeriness or credibility.  The acting is solid, never campy, though Michael Rooker sometimes feels out of place.  And the climactic scenes, built up to with good pacing, are fraught with peril and excitement.  All in all, this is a worthwhile effort for a first-time director, and that makes it one of the best direct-to-video releases I've seen in quite a long time.

{"description": "David O. Selznick wantedGone with the Windto be somehow more than a movie, a film that would broaden the very idea of what a film could be and do and look like. In many respects he got what he worked so hard to achieve in this 1939 epic (and all-time box-office champ in terms of tickets sold), and in some respects he fell far short of the goal. While the first half of this Civil War drama is taut and suspenseful and nostalgic, the second is ramshackle and arbitrary. But there's no question that the film is an enormous achievement in terms of its every resource--art direction, color, sound, cinematography--being pushed to new limits for the greater glory of telling an American story as fully as possible. Vivien Leigh is still magnificently narcissistic, Olivia de Havilland angelic and lovely, Leslie Howard reckless and aristocratic. As for Clark Gable: we're talking one of the most vital, masculine performances ever committed to film.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304117752", "0792839846", "6304178352", "630150528X", "6303215734", "B00000JS61", "0792151712", "0783222955", "0800116917", "6304151306", "630233683X", "6300183513", "0783221347", "6303494390", "B0000040EJ", "6302150620", "6300215814", "6301586026", "B00000F6D1", "6304274742", "6300215741", "0783235593", "B000056BRF", "6300215830", "6304400551", "6304239149", "6300185095", "6305282927", "0788806270", "6300207919", "6300213668", "6300181340", "6302610702", "5559477621", "6303854311", "B000059HH1", "6304039530", "0800100832", "B00004TYS8", "B00000JKNP", "B0000040EO", "6302936381", "6302227127", "6300215695", "6304039506", "6304994540", "6300277089", "6305576173", "630428635X", "6303020089", "B00005RRG3", "6301975987", "0783235607", "6301628454", "6300270971", "6303637574", "6300215628", "6304359705", "6304119046", "0792837207", "1558807780", "6300181987", "0783236352", "630251018X", "6302413435", "6303057225", "6301650514", "6304457316", "6300215512", "6301976061", "0800124693", "B000M7BEPQ", "B000005PPB", "630197350X", "6301976924", "0792837576", "B003UPPO2G", "6300267857", "B00005A1VG", "6301976983", "0790733897", "B00004RV8M", "6303651488", "6301969294", "6302241189", "6300246868", "B00000I1EM", "B0001E7LQG", "B00000F3QZ", "6303364772", "6303562248", "6304196954", "B00000FZCU", "6302640504", "6302360978", "0790733935", "6300181421", "6302484405", "6305718792"], "bought_together": ["6304117752", "6304178352"], "also_viewed": ["1451635621", "6304117752", "0792839846", "6304178352", "0800116917", "0792151712", "6304274742", "6304151306", "6303215734", "630233683X", "6304119046", "B00000JS61", "155890641X", "6305363668", "6304539258", "630018403X", "B002YZFBXA", "6302526574", "6300215598", "6300213668", "6301976983", "B0046ZE3LC", "6300215830", "0790743213", "6300182207", "6300181529", "B00000JGEI", "1558807780", "0792839129", "6304500831", "6304429274", "0784011923", "630150528X", "6304400225", "B00001IVED", "6300215717", "0788812408", "B00B7K0JZS", "0767825411", "B0000040EK", "B0000040EO", "0792158261", "B00008EYA5", "630141277X", "0800124693", "6302054982", "6303506291", "0783222955", "6300183211", "6300215814", "0790742322", "B00000JKNP", "B0000AM6IY", "B0000AQZYM", "0783216084", "6303402070", "6301797906", "630281622X", "6302961572"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 168297}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6305123616", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZGXJP009L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gone With the Wind [VHS]"}
{"description": "For director Robert Redford the trick was directing himself. The Oscar-winning director (Ordinary People,Quiz Show) says that he is one kind of actor (in the moment) and a different kind of director (more controlling). Whatever the problems, Redford has worked it out beautifully in this leisurely paced adaptation of Nicholas Evans's bestseller. When the prized horse ofNew Yorkmagazine editor's (Kristen Scott Thomas) daughter suffers a horrible accident, she tracks down Tom Booker (Redford), a Montana horse healer who is known for working magic. Soon East Coast brashness meets Old West simplicity as the reluctant Annie takes her even more reluctant daughter (Scarlett Johansson) to Marlboro country. Booker's influence goes beyond the horse through healing the heart of daughter and mother. The 2-hour and 44-minute film is a beautiful travelogue of scene and sky (with a giant assist from Oliver Stone's usual cinematographer, Robert Richardson). Never complicated, the movie's rewards may be hidden in its length and Redford's tendency to introduce us to a way of life instead of focusing on a story. The major deviation from the end of Evans's novel is a welcomed change.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790748193", "B0000DCGT1", "6305132666", "0767809262", "0792151712", "0767825616", "B000006N70", "6303153321", "6300214567", "6301586042", "B00004RGUU", "6302415853", "6305123616", "6304457324", "6302581907", "6302800420", "6300185095", "6302254132", "B00005NQGQ", "B00005PJ8I", "6300267970"], "bought_together": ["B0000DCGT1"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 113274}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.45, "brand": "", "asin": "6305126062", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41FQG9AC2GL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Horse Whisperer [VHS]"}
{"description": "If you were to argue that Mel Brooks'sYoung Frankensteinranks among the top-ten funniest movies of all time, nobody could reasonably dispute the claim. Spoofing classic horror in the way that Brooks's previous filmBlazing Saddlessent up classic Westerns, the movie is both a loving tribute and a raucous, irreverent parody of Universal's classic horror filmsFrankenstein(1931) andBride of Frankenstein(1935). Filming in glorious black and white, Brooks re-created theFrankensteinlaboratory using the same equipment from the originalFrankenstein(courtesy of designer Kenneth Strickfaden), and this loving attention to physical and stylistic detail creates a solid foundation for nonstop comedy. The story, of course, involves Frederick Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) and his effort to resume experiments in re-animation pioneered by his late father. (He's got some help, since dad left behind a book titledHow I Did It.) Assisting him is the hapless hunchback Igor (Marty Feldman) and the buxom but none-too-bright maiden Inga (Teri Garr), and when Frankenstein succeeds in creating his monster (Peter Boyle), the stage is set for an outrageous revision of the Frankenstein legend. With comedy highlights too numerous to mention, Brooks guides his brilliant cast (also including Cloris Leachman, Madeline Kahn, Kenneth Mars, and Gene Hackman in a classic cameo role) through scene after scene of inspired hilarity. Indeed,Young Frankensteinis a charmed film, nothing less than a comedy classic, representing the finest work from everyone involved. Not one joke has lost its payoff, and none of the countless gags have lost their zany appeal. From a career that includes some of the best comedies ever made, this is the film for which Mel Brooks will be most fondly remembered. Befitting a classic, the Special Edition DVD includes audio commentary by Mel Brooks, a \"making of\" documentary, interviews with the cast, hilarious bloopers and outtakes, and the original theatrical trailers. No video library should be without a copy ofYoung Frankenstein.

{"description": "Photographer and director Cindy Sherman has obviously always been interested in film. Her well-knownUntitled Film Stills, from movies that don't exist--pregnant scenes thatseemas though they arein medias resbut are really staged--feature diverse characters who, upon closer examination, prove to be Sherman herself, every time. Her 1998 film debut,Office Killer, takes her postmodern playfulness with such narrative frames out of the equation--and leaves us with something more flatly macabre and less subtle than Sherman's other work.Here, Carol Kane plays Dorine, a mousy, lonely, and introverted copyeditor for a consumer publication. Think for a moment what kind of person a copyeditor must be: this is the person whose job, whose passion, it is to know exactly where the apostrophe goes and to know the difference betweeneffectandaffect. The pressure can get to you.Tyrannized at home by a domineering mother and tyrannized at work by backstabbing coworkers, downsizing, and newfangled computers, Dorine finds that the copy she cleans up is her only pleasure in life. As pressure builds and builds--Kane's performance exhibits amazing mastery of body language--Dorine finally caves and steps into an insanity that, in a horrifying, animalian fashion, has its own pleasantness and reason. Despite Kane's strong acting here, she is supported by flattish performances from Molly Ringwald, Jeanne Tripplehorn, and Barbara Sukowa.It is unclear if Sherman means to serve or redefine the concept of narrative through this emotional detachment she brings to the screen. Certainly, this isn't a conventional film, and its cinematography and innovative story are indeed attention-keeping, even entertaining, on a horror-flick level at least. If her goal is to serve narrative canonically, then she fails almost miserably. If her goal is to redefine narrative, then she may have achieved something here that most critics aren't clueing into. It's just unclear what this achievement is.--Erik J.

{"description": "Kevin Costner's 1990 epic won a bundle of Oscars for a moving, engrossing story of a white soldier (Costner) who singlehandedly mans a post in the 1870 Dakotas, and becomes a part of the Lakota Sioux community who live nearby. The film may not be a masterpiece, but it is far more than the sum of good intentions. The characters are strong, the development of relationships is both ambitious and careful, the love story between Costner and Mary McDonnell's character is captivating. Only the third-act portrait of white intruders as morons feels overbearing, but even that leads to a terribly moving conclusion.

{"description": "It seems almost inconceivable that a film as great asLost  Horizonwould be nearly lost to the ravages of age and studio neglect.  Fortunately,  Columbia has compensated for past misdeeds with this superlative DVD release, which restores Capra's classic to near-complete form and provides a thorough--and thoroughly fascinating--account of the film's production and eventual restoration. Of particular interest to film buffs will be the engaging photo essay and accompanying narration by film historian Kendall Miller, whose affectionate (and infectious) obsession withLost Horizonis expressed here for the benefit of posterity. Equally engrossing is the full-length restoration commentary by UCLA film preservation expert Robert Gitt, whose efforts to restore this film were nothing less than heroic. Unfortunately, Gitt is teamed in the commentary with retiredLos Angeles Timesfilm critic Charles Champlin, whose contribution is amiable but superfluous. That quibble aside, this edition ofLost Horizonis one of the most rewarding DVDs of any classic Hollywood film. Although several of Frank Capra's other films have achieved a higher profile,Lost Horizonjust gets better as the years go by, and with its wealth of supplemental features, this DVD is a definitive archival tribute.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005KR6O1C", "B000GRUQL0", "8087888057", "B0006B2AA6", "B008D19ZPY", "B000KJU13C", "B0007PALVQ", "B00EOBB866", "B000083C8K", "B001GLX6US", "0895773619", "B0000714AT", "B000002ZBR", "B00049QQJQ", "B000BYA4HO", "B000083C6R", "B0043GAT5I", "B00KIZY3XW", "B001BSBBDK", "B000OHBCI8", "B00AATUZQA", "B00011D1OU", "B004P8R9OS", "B000ION7A8", "B00BGGITZU", "B00005JKFR", "B0049985XW", "B003NN9ZCK", "B001BSBBIA", "B0002B15RE", "B00006RCO3", "B0011WN03K", "B0006B2A7E", "B000FVQLLQ", "B000A9QK8M", "B0087ZG7OI", "B0039R18WU", "0783229488", "B000KX0IOU", "B000BITV92", "B00008LDNZ", "B000E6ESXK", "B00AEBB8VK", "B000CEV3L4", "B000F7CMQI", "B000085EFE", "B003MJZ07E", "B000HT3PGK", "B00KIZY0EE", "B00000CQJZ", "B001D8W7EU", "B006TTC5A4", "B0007TKNJ2", "B001GLX6UI", "8087830865", "B001GLX6TY", "B0035ECHIG", "B000FVQLKW", "B000BYA4II", "B001BSBBIK", "B000EU1Q1S", "B00005JMR7", "B000E1MXSW", "B000CNESN0", "B0007TKNH4", "B005E7SFAQ", "B00006RCO2", "B006FE83UE", "B00DZP1C9K", "B0000549B0", "B0033PSH7M", "B003YY2886", "B000244EYW", "B00A33J8U2", "B001SMC9L2", "B004DK9DQ0", "B000OFOJ30", "B00004RFHN", "B000A0GOF0", "B000KGGJ1I", "B0045HCJHG", "B0009S4IH4", "B00AEBB97S", "B0045HCJ9E", "B002GSXKQA", "B0045HCJQW", "B005OT7YX8", "B001GUYAZY", "B00AJCUL0I", "B000KJU13M", "B005ZVIN30", "B000NJXG68", "B00AEFXD1O", "B00000F17E", "B000069HYF", "B0002B15Y2", "B00008LDO1", "B000LC4ZD0", "B000B7MX6Q", "B0047BXR1C"], "bought_together": ["B005KR6O1C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005KR6O1C", "B0006B2AA6", "B000GRUQL0", "8087888057"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9024}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.05, "brand": "Unknown", "asin": "6305416222", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51esGDjolTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lost Horizon"}

{"description": "Michael Caine was robbed of an Oscar. He gives his finest performance in  a decade as big-talking small-time agent Ray Say, a paunchy, pale life of the party hiding his desperation under gold chains and cool bravura. When he hears the almost magical voice of Jane Horrocks's meek little LV (short for Little Voice) fill her bedroom with the rich voice of Judy Garland, he sees his ticket to the big time.Little Voiceis ostensibly LV's story, and in fact the original play was written for Horrocks, whose amazing vocal impressions of Garland, Shirley Bassey, and Marilyn Monroe (among others) form the centerpiece performance of the film. But as directed by Mark Herman (Brassed Off), the story of this mousy girl who shuts herself in from a bellowing world is just as overwhelmed by the bombastic characters as LV herself. Brenda Blethyn babbles a blue streak as LV's overbearing mother, Mari, an aging widow who escapes her unhappiness in carousing and becomes almost pathologically jealous when Ray's attentions turn from her to LV. As Ray puts his dreams on the line for LV's showcase, he reveals his true self: a venal man who spits and barks out his bottled-up anger in an astoundingly bile-filled delivery of Roy Orbison's \"It's Over.\" The showstopping moment once again overwhelms LV's tale, but Caine's performance is so astounding it seems a fair trade.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000IQC5", "B00003CXPD", "B00000FDMT", "B00004Z51R", "B000F7MICG", "B0079K4WEE", "6305622914", "B004A8ZWV0", "B003UESJFQ", "B00EPH8SBM", "0780619587", "B0002JZT5A", "B00003CXMY", "B001CC7PLM", "B00IXD2N1K", "B0013D8LC2", "B000ETRCN0", "B004X63RRA", "B000G6BLYC", "B0069UV0AY", "6305499144", "B007N5YJMA", "B000QXDCLK", "B0051HCVEU", "B00BJB2GRO", "B00005KHJX", "B001BBAVKQ", "B008NNSCYM", "B0000ARD7O", "B00007J5VN", "B004SUDQ2W", "B009NYF2GQ", "B00003CXPV", "B004SIP7D0", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B000WC39ZY", "B000BMY2LU", "B0036TGSR6", "B00005IA7Y", "B00005O06J", "B00008AOWL", "B00005JO3W", "B0000C9JFO", "B00020BW64", "B000KJU182", "B00DW5IJR6", "B00008DDVT", "B00DUX290S", "B000JF5TXO", "B00080ZGHO", "B005S9EJ14", "B00004XPPD", "B0009WFFB8", "B00AEBB9YQ", "B0019BI1DM", "B00009QUH4", "B005I0DV4Y", "B000ADS6DA", "B000E6ESL2", "B000E6ESU8", "B000065K2V", "B000HWXPXK", "B000NIVJFO", "B00AZMFO6I", "B00HGE90Z4", "B00H91LWDM", "B00009MEKN", "B0001Z4P6O", "B000063K0C", "B00CMQIDKY", "B001I2EQUY", "B004TPJMZQ", "B00AQ590DM", "B00A429YF6", "B000CSUNQQ", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B002ONC9NC", "6305692696", "B0011FDVGI", "B007XTDWKQ", "B00005JKTF", "B00005PJ6O", "B008Z0D5L8", "B0000714BP", "B0080QOL10", "B0080QOKYS", "B00001U0DW", "B000274TLW", "B009B8YZ76", "B000U2U0E4", "B005F265FW", "B0073U2EWM", "B00009IB1D", "6305428085", "B00000F3FS", "B0001US78G", "B0001GOH6Q", "B00AEFXD1O", "B000GIXLTS", "B0013527L6"], "bought_together": ["B00000IQC5", "6305622914"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CXPD", "B00000IQC5", "B00EPH8SBM", "B00000FDMT"]}, "price": 22.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 200977}, "asin": "6305428298", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/714YSMYYVTL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Little Voice"}

{"description": "Are you wondering just exactly who the Blair Witch was? What the Burkittsville, Maryland, legend was all about? Or what exactly fascinated student filmmaker Heather and what possibly took her, Mike, and Josh from this earth? Get all your background questions answered byCurse of the Blair Witch, a one-stop-shopping \"documentary\" originally produced for the Sci-Fi Channel as a tie-in marketing tool. Entirely fictionalized,Curse of the Blair Witchfocuses both on the past and the present, with copious info on the Blair Witch myth as well as on the disappearance of Heather, Josh, and Mike. As it turns out, the original witch was one Elly Kedward, who was accused in 1785 of taking blood from several children; she was subsequently banished to the harsh winter woods and left for dead. Her grisly and bloody legacy involves missing children, polluted water, disemboweled men, and a serial killer of children who claims to have been haunted by \"an old woman ghost.\" Aside from some ineffective \"newsreel\" footage of the serial killer, all this intriguing information is presented convincingly and chillingly.Cursemay in fact freak you out more than the movie, and it evokes the great, pulpyIn Search Ofseries of the '70s, one of the prime inspirations for filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez. News clips of the search for Heather, Josh, and Mike lend a v&eacute;rit&eacute; atmosphere to the proceedings, but shed little light on their mysterious disappearance or their characters. Basically, it's a tease to go see the movie. Still,The Blair Witch Projectprovided only ever-so-slight information on the legend that haunted the forest, so you'll want this cleverly constructed mock documentary to supplement your knowledge of the film.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["0743411536", "B0002IHP1C"], "also_viewed": ["B000056V6H"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 287495}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 7.87, "brand": "", "asin": "6305568901", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SAG2GJGGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]"}

{"description": "\"I have a bad feeling about this,\" says the young Obi-Wan Kenobi  (played by Ewan McGregor) inStar Wars: Episode I, The Phantom  Menaceas he steps off a spaceship and into the most anticipated cinematic event... well, ever. He might as well be speaking for the  legions of fans of the original episodes in theStar Warssaga  who can't help but secretly ask themselves: Sure, this isStar  Wars, but is itmy Star Wars? The original elevated  moviegoers' expectations so high that it would have been impossible for  any subsequent film to meet them. And as with all theStar Warsmovies,The Phantom Menacefeatures inexplicable plot twists, a  fistful of loose threads, and some cheek-chewing dialogue. Han Solo's  swagger is sorely missed, as is the pervading menace of heavy-breathing  Darth Vader. There is still way too much quasi-mystical mumbo jumbo,  and some of what was fresh aboutStar Wars22 years earlier  feels formulaic. Yet there's much to admire. The special effects are  stupendous; three worlds are populated with a m&eacute;lange of creatures, flora, and horizons rendered in absolute  detail. The action and battle scenes are breathtaking in their  complexity. And one particular sequence of the film--the  adrenaline-infused pod race through the Tatooine desert--makes the chariot race inBen-Hurlook like a Sunday stroll through the park.Among the host of new characters, there are a few familiar walk-ons. We  witness the first meeting between R2-D2 and C-3PO, Jabba the Hutt looks  younger and slimmer (but not young and slim), and Yoda is as crabby as  ever. Natalie Portman's stately Queen Amidala sports hairdos that make  Princess Leia look dowdy and wields a mean laser. We never bond with  Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson), and Obi-Wan's day is yet to come. Jar Jar Binks, a cross  between a Muppet, a frog, and a hippie, provides many of the movie's lighter moments, while Sith Lord Darth  Maul is a formidable force. Baby-faced Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) looks too young  and innocent to command the powers of the Force or wield a lightsaber (much less transmute into the future Darth Vader), but his  boyish exuberance wins over skeptics.Near the end of the movie, Palpatine, the new leader of the Republic,  may be speaking for fans eagerly awaitingEpisode IIwhen he  pats young Anakin on the head and says, \"We will watch your career with  great interest.\" Indeed! --Tod Nelson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000633ZP", "6301792734", "B00005JLXH", "B00006HBUJ", "6304539258", "6304539274", "6301792769", "B000FQVX78", "6304539290", "0792158261", "B000FQJAJG", "6304117752", "0767729307", "B001GQSY5K", "6304178352", "B000FAGGWQ", "B00BBND56G", "B000FQJAIW", "B00005LL26", "B00003CXCT", "B00003CXI0", "B002I9Z8AS", "B00006AL1C", "B00CFWWDWE", "B000066HAS", "B000001ON6", "B000MUANT6", "6305587159"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLXH", "B00006HBUJ"], "also_viewed": ["B00006HBUJ", "B00005JLXH", "B00E9PMML2", "B0000633ZP", "6301792734", "B00BBND56G", "6304539258", "6301792769", "6304539274", "B00006JDUE", "0767729307", "B00E9PMMX0", "B000FQJAIW", "B000FQVX78", "B000FQJAJG", "B00000IQMT", "B000FAGGWQ", "B003ZSJ212", "0345434110", "6303148352", "6304089767", "0439834775", "6304117752", "B00BUZW14M", "6304500831", "0590010891", "0345341465", "6304434340", "B001GQSY5K", "155890641X", "B00005LL26", "6302961572", "0792151712", "B003W77SEO", "B000M4Y8JI", "0767825411", "B00003CXXI", "B00000IZ8A", "B00169IZN8", "6302787068", "B00006G8LB", "080010367X", "0800125762", "6302091632", "0792158261", "B000850IS6", "6300214826", "6303506291", "B00005V1Z8", "B000641D2Y", "0784011923", "B00008Y47S", "6300214060", "630382790X", "B00003CXI0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 79460}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.44, "brand": "Star Wars", "asin": "630575067X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41SJPKK4S4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Wars - Episode I, The Phantom Menace [VHS]"}

{"description": "John Lasseter and his gang of high-tech creators at Pixar create another entertainment for the ages. Like the few great movie sequels,Toy Story&nbsp;2comments on why the first one was so wonderful while finding a fresh angle worthy of a new film. The craze of toy collecting becomes the focus here, as we find out Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) is not only a beloved toy to Andy but also a rare doll from a popular '60s children's show. When a greedy collector takes Woody, Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) launches a rescue mission with Andy's other toys. To say more would be a crime because this is one of the most creative and smile-inducing films since, well, the firstToy Story.Although the toys look the same as in the 1994 feature, Pixar shows how much technology has advanced: the human characters look more human, backgrounds are superior, and two action sequences that book-end the film are dazzling. And it's a hoot for kids and adults. The film is packed with spoofs, easily accessible in-jokes, and inspired voice casting (with newcomer Joan Cusack especially a delight as Cowgirl Jessie). But as the Pixar canon of films illustrates, the filmmakers are storytellers first. Woody's heart-tugging predicament can easily be translated into the eternal debate of living a good life versus living  forever.Toy Story&nbsp;2also achieved something in the U.S. two other outstanding 1999 animated features (The Iron Giant,Princess Mononoke) could not: it became a huge box-office hit.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304089767", "B00005JKDQ", "B0000AQZYM", "6305326940", "0788805843", "0788812408", "155890641X", "6303314015", "0788802194", "B000035Z2S", "0788805533", "6305229449", "078881172X", "6304500831", "0788812807", "6302526574", "6302642248", "6303983812", "B00003CXQX", "6304401132", "0788806270", "6302787068", "6305940932", "6302320402", "6304290888", "6303534422", "B00275EHJG", "B00004T2SI", "6305319138", "B00005JL95", "0788803743", "6302178924", "6300274268", "6304100507", "6305942285", "B00004R99N", "6300275310", "B00006CXK5", "B00003CXXI", "B00005JMQY", "6304400225", "6304400551", "6302961572", "6303122647", "6304501153", "B00005JKX3", "0788811002", "6300274195", "B0000E32WB", "6303929338", "B00005T7H6", "6304978286", "B00005RDVV", "B00016JF2W", "6302158095", "B0000524CZ", "6304401736", "B000035Z46", "B00003CXHR", "0788812440", "6303036813", "6304089201", "B0007A2GSM", "B00000JS61", "B000028U3S", "B00005RRG3", "6301991311", "B00003CWPW", "B00009L4S1", "6304400381", "6300274608", "B00003CXQ6", "B00000I7Q3", "0788812181", "B000AY74OQ", "6305559295", "0792153677", "B00005LOUS", "0788809806", "078880720X", "B000009CTR", "1558906150", "B00001YX9H", "6301390725", "B00007AJLB", "B00000J2JA", "6304434340", "0783221800", "B00000ICHA", "1558907718", "6303148387", "B00004T2SJ", "6304155972", "6303939015", "0788810448", "6301404440", "630169774X", "B00003CXQ0", "6302968143", "B00006IUM9"], "also_viewed": ["6304089767", "6303314015", "B00005JKDQ", "B0000AQZYM", "0788805843", "6302787068", "0788812408", "6305326940", "155890641X", "0788805533", "0788802194", "6305940932", "6302320402", "078881172X", "6305229449", "6302526574", "6304500831", "B000035Z2S", "B00003CXQX", "6303983812", "6302642248", "6304100507", "6300274195", "6304290888", "0788812807", "0788806270", "6303036813", "6300274268", "6305319138", "B00005JL95", "6304501153", "6300275310", "B00004T2SI", "6303534422", "6305942285", "6302178924", "B00003CXXI", "6304401132", "6302961572", "B0007KTBIU", "6304400551", "6303929338", "6304089201", "B00004R99N", "6304978286", "B0000524CZ", "B00275EHJG", "B00005JKX3", "B00000I7Q3", "B00003CXHR", "6304089112", "6302426200", "B0000E32WB", "B00006CXK5", "B0030IIZ4M", "6305310068", "6304401736", "B00016JF2W", "B000063V8N"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 182756}, "asin": "6305949557", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515BCFM46JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Toy Story 2 [VHS]"}

{"description": "Pixar genius reigns in this funny romantic comedy, which stars a robot who says absolutely nothing for a full 25 minutes yet somehow completely transfixes and endears himself to the audience within the first few minutes of the film. As the last robot left on earth, Wall-E (voiced by Ben Burtt) is one small robot--with a big, big heart--who holds the future of earth and mankind squarely in the palm of his metal hand. He's outlasted all the \"Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class\" robots that were assigned some 700 years ago to clean up the environmental mess that man made of earth while man vacationed aboard the luxury spaceship Axiom. Wall-E has dutifully gone about his job compacting trash, the extreme solitude broken only by his pet cockroach, but he's developed some oddly human habits and ideas. When the Axiom sends its regularly scheduled robotic EVE probe (Elissa Knight) to earth, Wall-E is instantly smitten and proceeds to try to impress EVE with his collection of human memorabilia. EVE's directive compels her to bring Wall-E's newly collected plant sprout to the captain of the Axiom and Wall-E follows in hot pursuit. Suddenly, the human world is turned upside down and the Captain (Jeff Garlin) joins forces with Wall-E and a cast of other misfit robots to lead the now lethargic people back home to earth. Wall-E is a great family film with the most impressive aspect being the depth of emotion conveyed by a simple robot--a machine typically considered devoid of emotion, but made so absolutely touching by the magic of Pixar animation. Also well-worth admiring are the sweeping views from space, the creative yet disturbing vision of what strange luxuries a future space vacation might offer, and the innovative use of trash in a future cityscape. Underneath the slapstick comedy and touching love story is a poignant message about the folly of human greed and its potential effects on earth and the entire human race.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000VBJEEG", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00007LVCM", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B00AFEX83C", "0736424229", "B00005JN4W", "B00005JNQS", "B0042U94UQ", "B00E9ZATJO", "B001OMU6UM", "B00005JNS0", "B0030IIZ4M", "B0034JKZ86", "B002ZG97YM", "B002WJI2QQ", "B004HO6I4M", "B008YWY0HK", "B0012EM5D8", "B0006UEVT0", "B009SZCC9U", "B004G600A4", "B00AAXFYPI", "B00F522C7C", "B008Z1LBU4", "B00CTNYLQA", "B003H9M1Q2", "B000AAF1TU", "B008JFUQ16", "B000ROAK2W", "B000AY74OG", "B00275EHJG", "B00CWM58WY", "B00009M9BK", "B00EV1YZ96", "B001DPHDCY", "B000MV9026", "B001O5LVPI", "0783231474", "B00CQRN3QI", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00I6JOD2S", "B001HN6922", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B0087F7VSY", "B001U2MQE0", "B0030IIYYS", "B00A83075M", "B00H4Z07Q6", "B005LAIH4A", "B000DWMYQ8", "B00CHVJODE", "B0000AOX0O", "B003UESJF6", "B00JK531ES", "B00HLTD2OE", "B0001I561E", "B00BGYO7HG", "B003ZHVJGO", "B001ILFUD2", "B0002YLCOM", "B0039N74CW", "B00004U9WQ", "B00937R6QC", "B00CUDD0C0", "B004EPZ034", "B00004R99S", "B00003CXB4", "B000065V42", "B00005RDSQ", "B004ZBACOE", "B001GCUO7A", "B00AO686JC", "B000AAF1U4", "B0006JMLRK", "B00005JMQZ", "B0043X1FOK", "B00C7JGDBW", "B001JRB17Y", "B001KVZ6G6", "B00005TN8K", "B00005JMFH", "B00E9ZATKI", "B001ILFUDC", "B000V1Y44G", "B00003CX8Y", "B0011U52E2", "B00EBBGLFC", "B000YERP2S", "B00009YXAW", "B00003CXCQ", "B002NZK5SW", "B000G75AZC", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B0084IHVGG", "B00947N6D8", "B004LWZW7Y"], "bought_together": ["B001KVZ6FW", "B000VBJEEG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004HO6I4M", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00I6JOD2S", "B00005JN4W"]}, "price": 17.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 319062}, "asin": "7883706837", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51u-jDIxUZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)"}
{"description": "Generally acknowledged as a bona fide classic, this Francis Ford Coppola film is one of those rare experiences that feels perfectly right from beginning to end--almost as if everyone involved had been born to participate in it. Based on Mario Puzo's bestselling novel about a Mafia dynasty, Coppola'sGodfatherextracted and enhanced the most universal themes of immigrant experience in America: the plotting-out of hopes and dreams for one's successors, the raising of children to carry on the good work, etc. In the midst of generational strife during the Vietnam years, the film somehow struck a chord with a nation fascinated by the metamorphosis of a rebellious son (Al Pacino) into the keeper of his father's dream. Marlon Brando played against Puzo's own conception of patriarch Vito Corleone, and time has certainly proven the actor correct. The rest of the cast, particularly James Caan, John Cazale, and Robert Duvall as the rest of Vito's male brood--all coping with how to take the mantle of responsibility from their father--is seamless and wonderful.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["630021639X", "6302158176", "6300183211", "6304214502", "6300214826", "0790705141", "6303168507", "0790733927", "B00003CXE6", "630470786X", "6300267997", "0790741512", "6303471501", "6300271331", "6302054982", "6303686796", "B00005PJ8I", "B00004COR2", "0792842111", "6304258984", "6304509146", "0783216084", "6300215644", "6300216500", "B000062XM6", "0800199421", "B0002F6BQU", "0800116917", "630336568X", "6304508611", "B00000F13T", "6304935811", "6305363668", "B000005PFL", "6300182878", "0792116887", "6300182452", "B00005B238", "0792845684", "6300247171", "0792839846", "6302482712", "6302989787", "0790732017", "0800100832", "630442972X", "6304196954", "B000065U6Q", "6301208773", "B00000K2SC", "6302842263", "6304429274", "6303313345", "B0000A36J1", "B000059XY5", "079212569X"], "bought_together": ["630021639X", "6302158176"], "also_viewed": ["6302610702", "630021639X", "6301792734", "6303402348", "6300215830", "6304117752", "6300183211", "6302158176", "B00COYZF5A", "6300214060", "B000NTPDSW", "6305095566", "0792151712", "6305169187", "6303953425", "080010367X", "6302054982", "6301208773", "B000KX0ISG", "630310696X", "6302415853", "6304214502", "B00005B238", "6303168507", "B00E9PMMX0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 270877}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.98, "brand": "", "asin": "B000003KHS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/11KQ3QC757L.jpg", "title": "The Godfather [VHS]"}

{"description": "Hidden throughoutCach&#xE9;is the sense that you should be watching every moment in this film closely, just as the protagonists are themselves being watched by someone unknown. Georges and Anne Laurent&#x92;s (Daniel Auteuil and Juliette Binoche) enviable lives are terrorized by the sudden arrival on their doorstep of a videotaped recording of their Parisian townhouse. It&#x92;s nothing but a long, unedited shot of the fa&#xE7;ade of their house, but it&#x92;s disturbing nonetheless. Soon another arrives, this time of the farmhouse Georges grew up in, and then another of a car driving down a suburban street, and a walk down a hallway to a low-rent apartment. Again the videos are benign but unsettling. Then the mystery becomes more threatening when they receive gruesome postcards depicting child-like drawings of bloody, dead stick figures. Georges believes he knows who the culprit is, but for reasons all his own  refuses to let his wife in on the secret. Clearly more is hidden here than just the identity of their stalker. InCach&#xE9;, writer and director Michael Haneke skillfully, methodically pulls back multiple layers of deception, like new skin being pulled off an old wound. he masterfully fuses elements of his predecessors to create a film that is haunting and memorable. There is Bergman's fascination with the complexity of relationships, the suspense and lurking danger of Hitchcock, and the unique cinematic sensibility of Antonioni. In fact, the provocative final shot is practically a tribute toThe Passenger--a lot of people will want to rewatch it many times to see what they can find in it (if, after watching it, you are still unsatisfied with the resolution, then watch the interview with Haneke in the DVD's special features for his insights). It's a film of great effect and intrigue. There are no easy resolutions, and the answers given in this mystery will only lead to more questions.--Daniel Vancini", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002BWP4A6", "B00006LPER", "B000SIWHAK", "B00386OWUC", "B00187FPC2", "B00062134E", "B000068MAL", "6305228876", "B0002DB52M", "B00AIBZLHS", "B002BWP3UC", "B000OVLBGC", "B000B9EYFW", "B002AG2NTI", "B0057GYODG", "B00005N89H", "B0036TGSJE", "B000G0O5IM", "B000MTEFP0", "B00092ZLEY", "B0012QE4PI", "B0019UGYAU", "B00005N8A9", "B00023P4N8", "B0007Z0NYQ", "B0001EFUFK", "B000EHQU3A", "B002VKB0M4", "B00151QYE4", "B00005JKJA", "B000N4SHOO", "B00HVOFP6W", "B00AIBZLR8", "B005KQVE1S", "B00K0MM4AM", "B004WPYO7E", "B00HE011DE", "B006KH6CF4", "B000N3T0DW", "B00008976W", "B0007OCG5G", "B000059HA5", "B000083C5F", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B00018D40O", "B002VECLXC", "B00AX7PGQS", "B003VA3JTA", "B00005QAPJ", "B00005OSLQ", "B003Y5H4R0", "B00HT2RTU6", "6305744114", "B00005K9O8", "B00429MM1K", "B002P7UCJK", "080215056X", "B000E5LEV0", "B00009W0U4", "B000EHQU30", "B000BRBA8S", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B00IGK6TH4", "B00005JLQW", "B0007GAG42", "B00000K3TS", "B00K72HVBC", "B00005NFZC", "B000HIVIQU", "B000N6TX1I", "B000OCY7JE", "B007A9EGG8", "B001CIOCLC", "B00AEBB89W", "B000N2HBIO", "B00CQ8HCSM", "B000EQ5V2C", "B000E6EGT6", "B000934FC2", "B0087IT8FK", "B002BWP3UM", "B0006Z2NCM", "B00GRA7M2G", "B00ATK015K", "6305999872", "B001AZJKKK", "B000GBEWNY", "B000GBEWPC", "B00F6SHGF8", "B00008976Y", "B000FVQM2Y", "B00H4IR3JC", "B004ODLUIU", "B0006IUE9I", "B004YCKKH8", "B00455JE58", "B002ZG4Q66", "B0081HLM2E", "B00AEFXN9G", "B0024FAG2Q"], "bought_together": ["B002BWP4A6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002BWP4A6", "B00187FPC2", "B0036TGSJE", "B00006LPER"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17815}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.28, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00000F7E6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41CS99VVAKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cache (Hidden)"}

Tarzan (vacantly handsome Casper Van Dien) and Jane (nondescript Jane March) head back to the jungle homeland and encounter pillaging baddies led by Steven Waddington (used better as a more complex nasty inThe Last of the Mohicans). Director Carl Schenkel's film gives Tarzan back his long-absent status as an articulate gentleman, and it contains elements of Burroughs's feverish imagination, but it dully ticks off the \"adventures\" without any thrilling sense of fun. Schenkel is so inattentive to detail that he would have us believe no one raises an eyebrow at the sight of a man morphing into a humongous cobra (not that theXena-level effects help). It's blandly amusing watching Van Dien plug away ineptly at both his heroics and English accent, though this is ultimately an empty diversion for completists only.--Steve Wiecking", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001NBLYK", "B004H83IGY", "B004H83INM", "B0001IN0N0", "B001O4C6Q2", "B00BGP4LDA", "B00BTOM36A", "B000HXDEW6", "B00BTYMPUY", "B007K7IASA", "B00BGP4M8E", "B0001NBLYA", "1781161690", "B0002T7YY4", "B001ARDC16", "B000FVQLTS", "B002FOFXNS", "B000286RD4", "B007K7IC6K", "B000B5XP8I", "B000HEWEG2", "B00BH4196M", "B00G7QPX6C", "B003JCUGYQ", "B0002A2VLY", "B002ID099Y", "B00HW3LAF2", "B00006L949", "B000AQOHMG", "B00AKK6MD4", "B0001IN0LC", "B000EHSVPK", "B00AEFYEU8", "B00H91LVOM", "B00F6Y3FLG", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B009H3LP82", "B00BCMT49I", "B00DX88IL4", "B000A3XY6Y", "B007N3202S", "B00AMDA2P8", "B003JCYBS8", "B000067J1O", "0486295702", "B003RHZ6IE", "B00264QI68", "B004I1K2FK", "B001KO1BCG", "B00283QELG", "B001AR0D40", "B000FUTVUK", "B00005KARI", "B0034JKYSC", "B0001Z37HM", "B002U0KHME", "B000JMKKJU", "B00023GG9Y", "1435134443", "B001Q8MMBK", "B00C7A8WZQ", "B000RPCK0Q", "078321958X", "B000056WR3", "6304810903", "B004EXWGJW", "B000AAF1TU", "B00D2ZF24O", "B00000IZ90", "B0002KVUKM", "B00BC0JGUW", "B0000844I8", "B005H7NO5E", "0767817478", "B005LAII3A", "B0000696HW", "B0000DD77G", "B001J2XRLM", "1781162956", "B0006SST4K", "B001AOW6O8", "0441544606"], "bought_together": ["B0001NBLYK", "B004H83INM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001NBLYK", "B004H83INM", "B004H83IGY", "B000HEWEG2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 155663}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 33.95, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00000JGHW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y5MXK2S8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tarzan and the Lost City"}

Also on the plus side is the bounciest Alan Menken music sinceLittle Shop of Horrors.

{"description": "The original 1943 film that inspired the sexier 1982 Natassja Kinski remake is an intriguing metaphor for sexual repression and anxiety.  When a Manhattan ship architect named Oliver Reed (Kent Smith) marries beautiful but psychologically tortured fashion sketch artist Irena Dubrovna (Simone Simon), he has little knowledge of her past other than that she is tortured by myths from her European homeland.  His bride fears she will transform into a deadly panther if aroused or angry.  Once their passionless marriage deteriorates, and Oliver begins to ponder a romance with his coworker Alice Moore (Jane Randolph), Irena's jealousy and anger begin a series of transformations that threaten her therapist, her husband, and Alice. Director Jacques Tourneur never shows Irena's metamorphosis, usually implying the presence of her feline alter ego through creepy sound effects, ominous shadows, and dramatic camera angles, all elements that effectively generate suspense and fear.  This black-and-white mood piece takes its time building up its story, and while Irena's inner panther could easily be interpreted as representing the wrath of a woman scorned,Cat Peoplegoes deeper in probing her psychic scars.--Bryan Reesman", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 538725}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Cat People [VHS Tape] (1942)", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B000A0GOF0"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/717CBDHQ1ML._SY300_.gif", "asin": "B00001W0F7"}

{"description": "Years ago, priests exorcised a demon out of young Maya Larkin (Winona Ryder). Now she uses her unusual sensitivity to the same demons who once came after her to help the priests in other exorcisms. In one such case, a serial killer named Henry Birdson (John Diehl) claims to know the name of a man who will soon be possessed by Satan, beginning a reign of evil over the world. Maya discovers that the man in question is Peter Kelson (Ben Chaplin), an author of true-crime books who has both wealth and fame but no religious faith. At first Peter is skeptical, but a series of strange and mysterious clues indicates that he might indeed be the victim of a massive satanic conspiracy. Maya and Peter must work together to learn how to reverse what has already begun before time runs out. A haunting and creepy religious horror movie in the tradition of ROSEMARY'S BABY and THE EXORCIST, LOST SOULS features shocking, disturbing imagery and a deeply rooted sense of human mortality.", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1026954}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXOF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41K7GDRR5WL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lost Souls [VHS]"}
{"description": "The Replacementsmanages to be both completely formulaic and yet immensely enjoyable. When a professional football players' strike happens, the owner of a fictitious team, the Washington Sentinels, commissions maverick coach Jimmy McGinty (Gene Hackman) to pull together a team. McGinty selects a collection of talented oddballs--a Welsh soccer player, a sumo wrestler, a couple of professional bodyguards--with athletic pasts, figuring that if it doesn't work out as a game, it might as well be a circus. To lead the team, he finds Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves), a once-promising player who had a disastrous championship game. Naturally, despite squabbling and bickering, a roguish camaraderie develops through a mixture of racial infighting, harassment from the striking professionals, and a big bar brawl--after which they're all thrown in jail and perform the most improbable impromptu dance number ever committed to film. The mixture of cheerfully clich&eacute; plot mechanics, an engaging collection of supporting actors (including Orlando Jones, Rhys Ifans fromNotting Hill, and Jon Favreau fromSwingers), and sheer ridiculousness somehow combines to makeThe Replacementscompletely entertaining. Reeves is somehow turning into a pleasant leading man; he even emotes convincingly in this movie. And let's face it, Gene Hackman is quite possibly the greatest actor alive, able to speak the trashiest dialogue with fierce conviction. Plus, just to prove that the tight pants and close huddles of football are heterosexual, there are many, many shots of cheerleaders going through stripper-inspired routines.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00E1HIXFW", "B002NZK5QO", "6305428492", "B000J3OTT6", "B000056VP4", "B00AEFYJI0", "B00AEFYKWU", "B000FOPPDI", "B000NTMA0Q", "B0006GANOQ", "B000F6ZIIS", "B00005JPBO", "B00AEBB9UU", "B00005JNEW", "B000A0GP0Y", "B00005JKE4", "B00E8G5HZ0", "B000KHYN9C", "0792843592", "B001SGEUYW", "B00004W221", "B00AEFXJY0", "B002GIBVWA", "B000FVR1T2", "B001Q8MMBK", "B002VECM6S", "0780627849", "B00BTYNXJG", "B0009MDPYM", "630529142X", "B00005QW6W", "B00003CXND", "B004OBQDHK", "B004KPLVX6", "B002K0WBXW", "B000HEWEE4", "B00014NEZI", "B00005M20J", "0800177258", "B001BP4K22", "0767802454", "6305428530", "B004GJYRF0", "B00005JL93", "B000053VAX", "B00000F4ZY", "B000CCBCAI", "B0000B1OFL", "B00026ZD04", "6304712499", "6305428077", "B00000G3PA", "B000GAKDAG", "0767817710", "B00DW5IL92", "B002U4UYYQ", "6304711891", "B000U1ZV8A", "B00008L3W3", "6305213283", "0783228465", "B003AWRMBA", "B00FEHCQEC", "B008R65XTC", "B004BFTFBU", "B0047685IC", "0767817729", "B000QUCRB4", "B0026BXHPG", "B00000JGPE", "6305428387", "B0007DAGZ4", "B004KPLVWM", "6305428115", "B00AEBB86A", "6304806434", "6305262128", "078324021X", "B0000524E5", "6305065551", "B0006GAI5U", "B0001US66Y", "0767821513", "B0009X76ZK", "B000EXZFCQ", "B002GOAH1A", "B00AEFYDM2", "B00007E2F5", "B000A343RI", "B00AEFYIH2", "6305133468", "B00AEBB86U", "0783225741", "B000069HQ2", "B00005A3KS", "B002AT8KD8", "B000YGGNMO", "B007STBUHI", "B000089778", "B000ELJAEM"], "bought_together": ["B00E1HIXFW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00B83N2NU", "B000MNOX94", "B00005JKE4", "0790749912"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 62076}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.99, "brand": "Team Marketing", "asin": "B00003CXLV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513B1VE3PSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Replacements (Snap Case)"}

Kirsten Dunst stars as Torrance Shipman, the ditzy but loveable high school senior who is newly elected team captain of her high school cheerleading team. But when a replacement cheerleader, Missy Pantone, walks in to the Toros' cheerleading squad (hilariously portrayed by Eliza Dushku), she shows Torrance that the team's cheers are ripped off from the East Compton Clovers, and you can believe that the Clovers are fed up with the stealing. Torrance, horrified that her cheerleading career has been a fake, makes an effort to be original, but the result is a humiliating performance at a competition. Torrance is comforted by love interest Cliff Pantone (played by hottie Jesse Bradford), Missy's REALLY cute twin brother, and a romance begins. As the movie leads up to the UCA Nationals competition, the Clovers and Toros fight for the win. Who will it be? Well you better watch it for yourself. Bring It On is a refreshing change from the immature sick sex movies and it instead is fresh, bright, witty, and very funny.

{"description": "When 12-year-old Renato, riding through his small Italian town on his new bicycle, sees the voluptuous Mal&egrave;na, little does he know he's launching on an infatuation that will carry him through the tumultuous days of World War II.Mal&egrave;nabegins as an enraptured depiction of Renato's adolescent mind--the way he stares, hypnotized, at Mal&egrave;na's garters pressing through the material of her tight skirt, or his frustrated rebellion against the indignity of wearing short pants--but soon transforms into a portrait of small-town prejudice. Mal&egrave;na's looks spark lust and envy in the townspeople; when her husband dies in combat, the gossip only intensifies, to the point that Mal&egrave;na is dragged into court to defend herself against accusations of adultery. When the women of the town refuse to sell her edible food at the market, Mal&egrave;na has little choice but to become what she's been unjustly accused of being. At the end, a twist of fate turns this tale of longing and jealousy into a heartbreaking love story. Monica Bellucci exudes the can't-help-it eroticism that makes Mal&egrave;na such a lightning rod for everyone's desires; she's like a more zaftig Isabelle Adjani. The movie seems to wander at times, but the ending has a powerful emotional impact.

{"description": "Although this DVD is wrapped in the handsome packaging of the \"Vista Series,\" the extras here are minimal. The first disc has no extras but is packed with four separate Dolby Digital 5.1 tracks and is THX certified. The second disc holds four features, including a standard making-of featurette (15 minutes long) and a nifty segment that allows viewers to compare the storyboards to the final film and separate the music and sound effects in the train station sequence. More satisfying is the 20-minute short on the state of comic books, featuring revealing comments from critics and authors including Frank Miller (of the touchstoneDark Knightseries). Seven deleted scenes are introduced by the director, and while none is significant to the plot, they are all must-see for fans of the film.

{"description": "Julio Medem doesn't direct his films so much as weave them: images,  characters, criss-crossing stories, and recurring motifs intertwine, blur, and transform through time.Tierrabegins in the heavens and plummets to Earth, the camera rushing through space down to the red dust of a remote wine-growing  region in Spain. &Aacute;ngel (Carmelo G&oacute;mez) attempts to find grounding  in his work (he's been hired to fumigate the area, which has been infested by wood lice) but finds his wandering soul torn in two directions. Initially attracted to the lovely, lonely, ethereal &Aacute;ngela (Emma Su&aacute;rez), he  finds himself drawn against his better nature--in the form of a guardian angel, a phantom double that watches over him like an aggressive but well-meaning conscience--to the earthy, passionate, impulsive Mari (Silke). Medem sets his tale of love and lust amidst the stunning, austere landscape of fiery red hills, a world both primal and alien (dressed in white protective suits, the fumigators look like astronauts on Mars). Like his earlier filmThe Red Squirrel(which also starred G&oacute;mez and  Su&aacute;rez), Medem winds multiple stories together with natural history and philosophical musings until it all melts together in a lovely and unexpected conclusion. Medem crafts an equally dense story in his acclaimed follow-up film,The Lovers of the Arctic Circle, but where that film leapt into the emotional world of tragic melodrama,Tierratransforms \"wrong\" choices into revealing insights about the beautiful contradictions of human nature.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B007V6ON7M", "B00005RY9Z", "B004XVMCMG", "B0004Z32NI", "B000LXHFMW", "B000KRNMO4", "B0051T46YG", "B001LMU19G", "B000YI7MRM", "B000LPS3AI", "B000067J3O", "B006G1QDR6", "B004D45NZG", "B008BWFP2W", "B000JTUTXU", "B008I34ZLQ"], "bought_together": ["B007V6ON7M", "B004EI2NM2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007V6ON7M"]}, "price": 19.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 182102}, "asin": "B00003XAMC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CGJN89KXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tierra"}

Plenty of familiar faces, including Larry Hagman (who also directed), Burgess Meredith, Dick Van Patten, Robert Walker and Shelly Berman, add to the fun. A geologist (Godfrey Cambridge) unwittingly brings home an unusual frozen piece of debris from the North Pole. But when it accidentally thaws, the hungrier-than-ever blood-red Blob comes to life again, consuming nearly everyone in its path and terrorizing the town. No one is safe as it crawls into a bowling alley and oozes its way across an ice rink, becoming grotesquely bloated with the blood of its victims.

{"description": "This is the firstHellraisersequel that doesn't bear the  imprimatur of creator Clive Barker, and that makes it a sequel that manyHellraiserfans will want to disown, but they shouldn't dismiss it altogether. Now under the control of Miramax producers Bob and Harvey Weinstein, the franchise takes an entirely new direction, andInfernois primarily a detective thriller in which a corrupt cop (Craig  Sheffer) takes on a case that will judge his soul and, ultimately, damn him  forever. His judge and jury will be Pinhead (Doug Bradley) and his legion of  twisted Cenobites, but before he can be tried and condemned, Sheffer's cop will watch as those around him are killed off one by one, leaving a trail of blood (and telltale severed fingers) that leads back to the torment of his own youth.So, what you really have here is a variation onIt's a Wonderful LifeandA Christmas Carol, with all the themes reversed to hellish extremes. The plot doesn't hold together all that well, but you can't fault the film for establishing and maintaining a heavily somber tone. This is pretty dark stuff, after all, and althoughHellraiserfans will lament that Pinhead's appearance is relatively brief, he's presented here in an intriguing new light--not merely an icon of pain and suffering, but a giver of counsel and justice to those (like Sheffer's cop) who arguably deserve the eternal anguish they will receive. Does that make Pinhead a good guy? If this otherwise lugubrious sequel achieves anything, it's that it raises that question and lets the viewer decide.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004YCKJFG", "B00006ADFZ", "B004XYOQOA", "B004P7CMPK", "B0053TWVIM", "B0056P6SOG", "6305972001", "B00004Y633", "B000I2J68M", "B002HML6YI", "B0080QOKZM", "B008874968", "B000MV8AC2", "B001AGNMFI", "B000099T3M", "B004P7CM9Q", "B001NPD9LS", "B00BM4Q4H6", "B00AEFY2WI", "B009IV2Z3M", "B00AEFY31S", "B000FA57UI", "B00005LQ0Z", "B00AEFY2AA", "B00005LC4Q", "B00AEFY37C", "B004TJWDJY", "B004AC6PMG", "B00AEFY2LO", "B004P7CNF4", "B000WC3864", "B000VKL6Z2", "B000FA57US", "B0031U8OEK", "B000096I9V", "0783227434", "B0052XU4BK", "B004SUDQ0Y", "B0000ALPFL", "B009B8YNGO", "B000FS9FE4", "B00005NRN6", "B00AEFY2E6", "B0002IQMAM", "B00006IUFV", "B004P7CNUY", "0783230451", "B004SUDQ9K", "B000MV8ABS", "B00EVU3RSW", "B00006LPHA", "B0001611DI", "B001D5C1R6", "B0016MJ6P6", "B002YICNE2", "B0001US7OA", "B0000AOX08", "B00CERJINC", "B001B1UO6W", "B0000CEB6Y", "B00D7AM6M0", "B0000AOX09", "B00B4VSUW4", "B00AEFYV9W", "B001AXOFR0", "B0053TWW9K", "B002KH4KSY", "B000Q66Q8I", "B001JV5BIA", "0780630874", "B005CFBZQ6", "B00005N5RM", "B00006FDBT", "B004P7CNN6", "B0026UZHS2", "B00005JO16", "B0091G7BTM", "B000KJU1KK", "B0033B5XCS", "B000LC3ID8", "B0001LQJMQ", "B0050UEVN2", "B0058S0OMS", "B007I1Q4W2", "B000067FP8", "B0054602SU", "B005J9ZFQG", "B00AEFY1V0", "B000NVT0SO", "B000063US5", "B0009X76PK", "B00079Z9WI", "B00006FI0R", "B00105303S", "B002V3HT2G", "B005QX8UEE", "B00AEBB91E", "B0053FANPY", "B00005N5S5"], "bought_together": ["B004YCKJFG", "B004XYOQOA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0056P6SOG", "B004XYOQOA", "B004YCKJFG", "B008874968"]}, "price": 6.44, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 170962}, "asin": "B00004Y634", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511F5VDVMNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hellraiser: Inferno"}

{"description": "\"I'm gonna scare the hell out of you,\" intones Stephen King in the trailer for his sole directorial effort, the much-malignedMaximum Overdrive. While the end result doesn't live up to that boast, this sci-fi/horror tale isn't as awful as it's been described. King's script (based on his short story \"Trucks\") focuses on the patrons of a North Carolina truck stop, which comes under attack by a convoy of trucks and other machines animated by Earth's passage through the tail of a \"rogue comet.\" King's fans, tired of half-baked screen adaptations likeCujoandChildren of the Corn, expected a horror home run fromMaximum Overdriveand instead got an old-fashioned drive-in movie filled with car crashes, cheapjack gore, and fart jokes. Needless to say, they stayed away in droves; the film's failure helped ruin producer Dino De Laurentiis's DEG Films and forced King to sheepishly claim that he had created a modern-dayPlan Nine from Outer Space. While the film is torpidly paced and often amateurishly acted, it's no worse than any direct-to-video thriller, and King's ear for dialogue occasionally shines through the gloom. Emilio Estevez and Pat Hingle register as a heroic cook and his black-hearted boss, respectively; the cast includes Yeardley Smith (Lisa Simpson's voice), Giancarlo Esposito, and Marla Maples (!) as a victim. Anchor Bay's letterboxed print is the R-rated theatrical version; the film was cut extensively after receiving an X rating for violence. The original trailer and a thorough biography on King are also included.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305120021", "B0002O7XW2", "B000G1R39E", "B0013527K2", "6305645574", "B00006FDCU", "B0030BOCL4", "B0001FVDQ4", "B006J8NPAE", "B00A1AU72A", "B00006FDCD", "B0002A2VK0", "B0007WFXNA", "B000053UIF", "B00005UQ9V", "6304936397", "B0000C2IQQ", "B000068IES", "B00AEBB91E", "B00BW4S87U", "B000063UR5", "1573625779", "B00JF5GAIW", "0792841328", "B000AYELI8", "B000U1ZV6W", "B00009OWI3", "B0010X73ZG", "B00AEBB91O", "1573626910", "B00005LQ0Q", "B00BTYPW7C", "0767821599", "B005CFBZVG", "B001DZOC64", "0783228686", "B0053TWVDC", "B00BW4S8AC", "B00AEFYV9W", "1573623911", "B00000F3SB", "B0052XU4BK", "0790742829", "B0053TWW9K", "B000063JDM", "B002KH4KSY", "B002NZK5SM", "B000GYI340", "B00AEFY37C", "B002WDR4AC", "B000063US5", "B0053TWV46", "B003L2M584", "B0007NFMB2", "B0002OXVG4", "B000069I05", "B00AEFXR8I", "B00AKGG828", "B00KW3A6KE", "B00005RDAI", "630523650X", "0792842960", "B008A1TUW0", "B002GHHHH4", "B0052SO0LK", "6304604572", "B0053TWVA0", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B0084MVE7E", "B000MDFTHE", "B00005K3NR", "B00008WT5J", "B00APQLJTA", "6305756430", "B00006CXGP", "6305238065", "B00AEFXPG2", "B000H4JH7Q", "B002GHHHG0", "B006BZ8NSE", "B0002V7O3I", "B004AC6PMG", "B002WJHBE0", "157362408X", "B005OK0YVG", "B0033HKCV4", "B008DL4KZY", "B00005N5RM", "B00BW4S89S", "B00006RCOC", "B003VA3JUO", "B005LS4MQY", "B00AEFY31S", "B005DL6PLY", "B00005O439", "B00JVQ7PWU", "B00GJNQ4M0", "B00009PY4C"], "bought_together": ["B0002O7XW2", "B0013527K2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002WDR4AC", "6305120021", "B0002O7XW2", "B00A1AU72A"]}, "price": 79.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 111118}, "asin": "B0000509C5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51M1301NVNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Maximum Overdrive"}

{"description": "Stroszekis one of Werner Herzog's most accessible films, and one of his best. Herzog's clever use of kitschy folk music is just one perfect element in this mesmerizing, seriocomic \"ballad\" of America, in which a trio of unlikely friends leave their dreary lives in Berlin, certain that wealth and comfort await in America. Their naive American dream turns sour in rural Wisconsin, and the title character (played by Bruno S., the fascinating nonactor from Herzog'sThe Enigma of Kaspar Hauser) becomes an insanely tragic figure, celebrating a bitterly absurd Thanksgiving in the film's unforgettable closing scenes. By fusing his own intuitive, enigmatic style with factual details from the life of Bruno S., Herzog captures the elusive \"ecstatic truth\" that motivates his enduring cinematic vision. While deepening one of the most unusual actor-director collaborations in the history of film,Stroszekpresents an American nightmare that's funny, bizarre, and deeply, magnificently human.--Jeff Shannon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 214818}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Stroszek", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305972761", "B00005R248", "B00001ODHV", "B00003CXUM", "B00005QAPH", "B002U6DVPS", "6305744114", "B00005YJMX", "B005KQVE1S", "B002IVDLGY", "6305131104", "6305972796", "B001WLMOLE", "B004OOL73W", "B000WMA6R8", "B0049985XW", "B00006RCNV", "B000BR9S96", "B000I8OOG0", "0767846869", "B00K6D1QV8", "B00005R247", "0783225903", "B007N5YJPC", "B0001L3LUE", "B001QFFBAM", "B006TTC5MM", "B004EBT81I", "B0007GAG42", "B0040QYROA", "B003ZYU3U0", "B000BMY2NS", "B00005AUKC", "B001MPS7GG", "B00008Y47R", "B000E5LEVU", "B000093FLA", "B00AEFXN9G", "6305970971", "B001D8W7EK", "B004GJYR7I", "B0087ZG7R0", "B000LP6KNU", "B00005Y8UH", "B000065AZB"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001ZX0F6", "B00005R248", "6305972761", "B00005YKXQ"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41C0VKS3MGL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "B000059PPT"}

Attila is disclosed as a great leader, strategist and lover and the movie shows his respect to the great Roman strategist Flavius Aetius, his loves and passions, the gossips, intrigues and betrayals in Rome, all of these feelings evolved by magic and mysticism.\n\nDuring the waning days of Roman Empire, the barbarian Huns are making their way toward Europe. A warrior named Attila violently assumes Hun leadership and unites the warring clans under his banner. But this is not enough for him, Attila seeks to form an empire, and he sees Rome, bristling under the leadership of the incompetent Caesar Valentinian , ripe for the picking. In an attempt to quell a Hun invasion, ambitious Roman General Flavius Aetius attempts to form an alliance with Attila against their mutual enemy, Visigoth King Theodoric.

{"description": "Antoine Fuqua (THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS, BAIT) turns up the intensity level with TRAINING DAY, a charged drama about police corruption in downtown Los Angeles. Ethan Hawke stars as Jake Hoyt, a well-intentioned young officer who thinks he's found his ticket to becoming a detective in the form of undercover officer Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Harris is a notorious figure in the streets and in the office. He also has the authority to make Jake's professional wishes come true, provided Jake is able to prove his worth on Alonzo's team. At first, Alonzo's blunt, carefree demeanor provides a shock to Jake's optimistic system, but as it becomes clear that Alonzo is dangerously out of control, Jake must decide whether or not to risk his future in the name of the law.\n\nWashington's performance as the evil, pragmatic detective is a sight to behold. He delivers his lines with a devilish ferocity that keeps the film bubbling throughout. Hawke slips into the role of the rookie everyman with ease, providing a good contrast to Washington's fiery presence. Former video director Fuqua completes the picture by casting musicians Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and Macy Gray in supporting roles.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792841778", "630268644X", "6303012140", "6300214826"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 428216}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.0, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005JKEC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/415AYTB1GNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Training Day [VHS]"}

{"description": "Not surprisingly, deleted scenes and outtakes are the hands-down  highlights ofGoldmember's abundant Infinifilm features. Mike Myers's  throwaway gags are funnier than Pauly Shore's entire career, revealing how a  relaxed set encourages a flood of inspired improvisation.

The Myers/Jay  Roach commentary track is worth a listening for Myers's casual jocularity (and  his decent willingness to give credit to others), but their Hollywood  compliments, while obviously sincere, eventually grow tiresome. More enjoyable  are the pop-up subtitles in the DVD's \"Fact Track\" feature, adding lighthearted  factoids to enhance an already very funny movie.

{"description": "WithThe Return of the King, the greatest fantasy epic in film history draws to a grand and glorious conclusion. Director Peter Jackson's awe-inspiring adaptation of the Tolkien classicThe Lord of the Ringscould never fully satisfy those who remain exclusively loyal to Tolkien's expansive literature, but as a showcase for physical and technical craftsmanship it is unsurpassed in pure scale and ambition, setting milestone after cinematic milestone as the brave yet charmingly innocent Hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood) continues his mission to Mordor, where he is destined to destroy the soul-corrupting One Ring of Power in the molten lava of Mount Doom. While the heir to the kingdom of Men, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), endures the massive battle at Minas Tirith with the allegiance of the elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom), dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and the great wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), Frodo and stalwart companion Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) must survive the schizoid deceptions of Gollum, who remains utterly convincing as a hybrid of performance (by Andy Serkis) and subtly nuanced computer animation.Jackson and cowriters Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens have much ground to cover; that they do so with intense pacing and epic sweep is impressive enough, but by investing greater depth and consequence in the actions of fellow Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), they ensure thatReturn of the Kingmaintains the trilogy's emphasis on intimate fellowship. While several major characters appear only briefly, and one (Christopher Lee's evil wizard, Saruman) relegated entirely to the extended version on DVD, Jackson is to be commended for his editorial acumen; like Legolas the archer, his aim as a filmmaker is consistently true, and he remains faithful to Tolkien's overall vision. IfReturnsuffers from too many endings, as some critic suggested, it's only because the epic's conclusion is so loyally inclusive of the actors--most notably Astin--who gave it such strength to begin with. By ending theLOTRtrilogy with noble integrity and faith in the power of imaginative storytelling,The Return of the King, like its predecessors, will stand as an adventure for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B002ZG980U", "B002PMV9FG", "B008UZA8FY", "B001NGML48", "B00005JM5E", "B001GZ6QC4", "B005COPWZW", "B008M4C1EO", "B00HFFE8HE", "039548930X", "B000W7F5SS", "B000I0RQVI", "B002VWNIDG", "B000E6EK2Y", "B001BYMX4A", "B004M1A21K", "B007K3JFUQ", "B001DHXT20", "B001UV4XHY", "0345325818", "B003Y5H54W", "B00005JNJV", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000A3XY5A", "B004LWZWGA", "B000U7WV1Y", "B005LXQLRW", "B001OQCV6A", "B000E8M0VA", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000EHRVMY", "0618640150", "B003ZK99NQ", "B0013FDM7E", "B00005JPH2", "B000UNYK4E", "B009JBWOU0", "B00003CX5P", "B00008G8M5", "B00GKOJ98E", "B004LWZW42", "B000H30B2C", "B000P0J0C4", "B00CZDLGDU", "B000M341QE", "B00008G8M4", "B000FKO5QK", "B00HWWUQYY", "B007SPPANM", "B008JFUO72", "B001DJLD1M", "0345538374", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00005JKCH", "B004SIP9U6", "B000YGGNMO", "B00E5I2M9K", "0618126988", "B005OCFGTO", "B00E8S2JZ4", "6305313687", "B004AKCME8", "B0002KVUKM", "B000AARKOO", "B0006GAO5Y", "B000K7VHQ4", "B002ZG997C", "B00AHTYI5M", "B008JFUS0U", "B0042MEQVG", "B00275EGWY", "B00E9PMML2", "B008UZDXEW", "B004SIP7F8", "B00116GEJS", "B00003CXI1", "B003ZKBELG", "B003Y5H5EW", "B000V4UFZK", "B0007PLLBU", "B001DTPZNY", "B002O3Z50Q", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000LP6KNU", "B005G4TJUC", "B00AW0KHTM", "B002ZG97YM", "054792819X", "B00AEFXZJE", "B0000YEEGM", "B002IPFWTE", "B001ECQ75A", "B000065U1N", "B0051MKNV8", "B000W796OM", "B00J49R1BY"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HFFE8HE", "B00003CWT6", "B00005JKZV", "B00BEZTMFY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1589}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JKZY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HS7iSFv5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)"}
{"description": "Stephen Sondheim's Victorian horror thrillerSweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Streetis generally considered his greatest work, macabre but darkly humorous with a viscerally powerful score that has found a home both on Broadway and in opera houses. George Hearn (who replaced Len Cariou of theoriginal Broadway cast) plays the title character, a wronged man whose lust for revenge drives him to murder (an 18th-century legend who has been traced to a real-life barber), and Angela Lansbury plays his partner in crime, Mrs. Lovett, who finds a practical business use for Todd's victims. This combination of horror and humor is echoed in Sondheim's score: brooding menace (\"The Ballad of Sweeney Todd,\" \"My Friend\"), achingly beautiful ballads (\"Johanna,\" \"Not While I'm Around\"), clever puns (\"A Little Priest\"), coloratura arias (\"Green Finch and Linnet Bird\"), and intricate choral and ensemble numbers.Continuing a fortuitous tradition of capturing the Sondheim legacyon video recordings, this performance was filmed before a live audience in Los Angeles during the 1982 national tour. Almost 20 years later, Hearn returned to the role opposite Patti LuPone in an acclaimedconcert production. ButSweeney Toddis an especially compelling experience in this 1982 version, complete with the clever staging tricks (e.g., the barber's chair) and as close to the original cast as we're likely to see.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["630530209X", "B00001PE59", "B0009941IE", "B008SBXFUU", "B001LMAKAG", "B0007WFXZI", "B00004W5VC", "B0014IC31G", "B000I2J6YG", "B0060QSGJ0", "B00AEBBAEK", "B000JGWD32", "B00005KH3H", "B000093NR3", "B00003CWT3", "B00404ME0G", "B000NTM9ZM", "B00004XMTJ", "1557830665", "B0000C23HY", "B00BX8PG3Y", "B000IOM0S8", "B0000648Y0", "B008SBXFXM", "1423472721", "B00004RFEZ", "B006GHA9QQ", "B001LMAKAQ", "B009NYF2GQ", "B000BITUNE", "B000ATQYVK", "B0033HKCX2", "0307957721", "0783240287", "B000UAE7NG", "B002JT69LE", "B004VWXUWS", "B0028SVXVM", "B000CRR3P6", "B005SFR7YE", "B0014IC320", "B00DM3TKNU", "B002M2Z3Q0", "B00DVH20MA", "B00AEBBA1I", "B000E1YVZU", "B00JAOW3MA", "B008FYZHZ6", "B00404ME24", "B000RPCK2E", "B000O76ZR6", "B005IYGQGA", "B00079HZTS", "B00005TQ11", "B000VKL6RK", "B00008973A", "B00IXD2N1K", "B00005UQ8F", "B000EWBKMG", "B00IBQ5M1W", "B00KRFE9UK", "B000056NX5", "B000002W7H", "030759341X", "B004SEUJBE", "B009M1HJ3O", "B000649YA2", "B0007939M0", "B003FRQT8C", "B00005JL1P", "B00007J5VN", "B00AATV0WS", "1423492757", "B0074B2NC6", "B00J9PSDN8", "B00CEHHL2C", "B0045HCJ80", "B004I2K4E8", "B004I2K4DY", "B005SFS4ZU", "0440974836", "B00007L4MV", "B002NZK5TG", "B00005JM6A", "B00J2T18EW", "B0000BZNDK", "0767827929", "B0000AM6IY", "B00005NGA8", "B001EKH09E", "0930452933", "B005H8G78O", "B000JLSLZQ", "B00KLF5JHS", "B002HK9IDQ", "B000067IYK", "B000059PQI", "B00DM3TKR6", "B00JDCORSC", "B0033AI4PM"], "bought_together": ["B00001PE59", "630530209X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBBAEK", "630530209X", "B00001PE59", "B008SBXFUU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 142978}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 34.0, "brand": "TURNER HM ENTERTAINM", "asin": "B00005JL6V", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51w15KwalNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (Broadway) (Snap Case)"}

{"description": "Of all the spinoff TV incarnations ofStar Trek,Deep Space Ninehad the hardest job persuading an audience to watch. By all accounts, Gene Roddenberry had concerns about the idea before his death in 1991. It took two more years to develop, and when it finally aired in 1993 reasons for that concern were evident right away. The show was dark (literally), characters argued a lot, no one went anywhere, and the neighboring natives were hardly ever friendly. Yet for all that the show went against the grain of the Great Bird's original vision of the future, it undeniably caught the mood of the time, incorporating a complex political backdrop that mirrored our own.In the casting, there was a clear intent to differentiate the show from its predecessors. Genre stalwarts Tony Todd and James Earl Jones were considered for Commander Sisko before Avery Brooks. The one letdown at the time was that Michelle Forbes did not carry Ensign Ro across fromThe Next Generation, but when the explosive Nana Visitor defiantly slapped her hand on a console in the pilot episode, viewers knew they were in for a different crew dynamic. In fact, the two-part pilot show (\"The Emissary\") is largely responsible forDS9's early success. Mysterious, spiritual, claustrophobic, funny, and feisty, it remains the most attention-grabbing series opener (apart from the original series') the franchise has had. The first year may have relied on a few too many familiar faces--like Picard, Q, and Lwaxana Troi--but these were more than outweighed by refreshingly detailed explorations of cultures old and new (Trill, Bajoran, Cardassian, Ferengi). As it turned out,Deep Space Ninewas the boldest venture into Roddenberry's galaxy that had been (or ever would be) seen.--Paul Tonks", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008972H", "B00008KA5A", "B00008KGT0", "B00008KA59", "B00008KA58", "B00008KA57", "B000127LW2", "B0001NBNFW", "B0002JP4GE", "B0007TKH66", "B00062IDCO", "B00BHWG0CM", "B00BHWG0DQ", "B000228EBS", "B0002WZTCA", "B00062IDLA", "B000063V8T", "B0009I7NGW", "B000063V8R", "B000AOEMXC", "B000063V8S", "B00005Y1NF", "B000A6CLL0", "B000062XFG", "B00BHWG1AI", "B00BHWG0G8", "B002BAW6FE", "B001DHXT3Y", "B000VDDDY6", "B0017VG69U", "B002BAW6FY", "B000HEWEJ4", "B002BAW6GI", "B002I9Z8GM", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B00L4K3MLE", "B002BAW6GS", "B00K2CHWYI", "B002BAW6H2", "B00062IDDS", "B000AOEMXM", "6305181721", "B00IURL19Y", "B0019N95IK", "B00IWTVDUW", "B0083TUEHY", "B002I9Z8I0", "B002I9Z8EO", "B00GTZWZH6", "B000B8IA2G", "B002GP7ZV4", "B00062RCC6", "B000F8O2Q0", "B003H9LIRK", "B003ZFC9M4", "B00AZMFJYA", "B000BOH98G", "B0095XPZBC", "B00IO998U2", "B00243FQFA", "B000RZIGVS", "0671501062", "145169590X", "1451650744", "B00FFEM0W2", "B0081QF6Q8", "B00B5ARKC0", "B00IWTVDXO", "B007AFC0W4", "1451650701", "B004EXWGHY", "146540337X", "B001DHXT6G", "B000BOH8Z0", "B00CYQXHLC", "B000F8O2OM", "B002GP7ZVO", "B004HYW84G", "B001RHGRTS", "B000LC4ZI0", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B000BOH8Y6", "B000BOH986", "B00BARLSVC", "B00HETWFVC", "B00402FGE4", "B000BOH990", "B000P5FH44", "B0006FO9B0", "B005DEUEV8", "B00BD6K54G", "B002I9Z8BM", "B001DF681G", "B003H9LIU2", "B004TJ1H3C", "B00CKYHH6O", "B007USE5CE", "B00JPS6A3O", "B000CNE0T2", "B004XM38CS"], "bought_together": ["B00008972H", "B00008KA5A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00062RCC6", "B00008972H", "B0007TKH66", "B00008KA5A"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 28247}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 32.99, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B00005JLF5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FY7AHCEiL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek Deep Space Nine - The Complete First Season"}

All the  while he's pursued by a  dedicated FBI agent named Carl Hanratty (Tom  Hanks), whose dogged determination  stays one step behind Abagnale's  spontaneous wits. Both DiCaprio and Hanks turn  in enjoyable  performances and the movie has a bouncy rhythm that keeps it  zipping  along. However, it never gets under the surface of Frank's drive to lose   himself in other identities, other than a simplistic desire to please  his father  (Christopher Walken, excellent as always), nor does it  explore the complex  mechanics of fraud with any depth. By the movie's  end, it feels like one of  Frank's pilot uniforms--appearance without  substance.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00080ZG10", "B006OFN0SE", "B000M341QE", "B00AEBB8NI", "B001EZE5DI", "B004SIP7TE", "B000MZHW40", "0767905385", "B00005JMYC", "B002ZG980U", "B00049QQHI", "B0016Q2D66", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00003CWM3", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000P0J0EW", "B00008DP4C", "B000PHVZNE", "B001N44BVQ", "B00005JOC9", "B004SIP7ZS", "B0007DFJ0G", "B007SPPANM", "B00H9KKGTO", "B002T9H2LA", "0800141806", "B000N6U0E2", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEBB89W", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00001ZWUS", "B0050546MS", "B00DHHWXYY", "0783225733", "6304711891", "B00AEFY0F2", "B002VWNIEA", "B0051MKNV8", "B002ZG99N6", "B0077ATSSQ", "B00011CZRE", "B0013XZ2QK", "B00275EGWY", "B00005JKBC", "B00003CXWV", "B002O5M4T4", "B002FU8IWU", "B008MILL8W", "B004XQO90O", "B004SIP95G", "B000YAF4MA", "B005LAIIJY", "B00005JMJG", "B002QEHPQU", "0780631536", "B00DHDDE32", "B0031OCY2E", "0783240295", "B000P0J0BK", "B004FQX5B6", "B0034G4OUO", "B005HWAOP2", "6305313687", "B003UESJH4", "B000YABYLA", "B00005JKWX", "B00BEIYL6G", "B0058JEHSO", "B000A7DVR2", "B0002ZDVEU", "B00003CXZ1", "B00003CXQ4", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005RYLX", "B001VPCINK", "B000FKO5QK", "B0045HCJRG", "B009POCG0Y", "B00AEBB9SM", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B002DU39GW", "6304806434", "B00JQYV0B4", "B00AEFXE9U", "B00004WG2F", "B000EXZFCQ", "B00005JMCN", "B00006RCNV", "B000K7VHQE", "B00441GYXS", "B00A24CAAW", "B0045HCJ8K", "B004SIP9Z6", "B002NZK5R8", "B000K7VHTQ", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00005JL78", "0783233477", "B000J3OTT6", "B000O77SRC"], "bought_together": ["B00080ZG10", "B000M341QE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004SIP7TE", "B002ZG980U", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00ALTQRPW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7335}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.99, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JLSB", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51bPnAto--L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Catch Me If You Can (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)"}

{"description": "He's hunky, he's brooding, he's a do-gooder, and he was Buffy's first boyfriend. Angel, the tortured vampire destined to walk the earth with a soul, got his own series after three seasons onBuffy the Vampire Slayerand did what any new star might do: he moved to L.A. (the City of Angels--get it?) and set up shop.Angel(co-created byBuffymastermind Joss Whedon) finds the titular vampire (David Boreanaz) as a kind of supernatural private investigator, fighting evil one case at a time and, like his ex-girlfriend, keeping the world from getting destroyed by vengeful demons and such.A darker, more film noir version ofBuffy,Angellacked the peppy humor that permeated Sunnydale but more than made up for it in its soul-wrenching gravitas, and it elevated Boreanaz to leading-man status, a role he filled out ably and then some. Initially, the stoic vampire was paired with Irish demon Doyle (the late Glenn Quinn) and fellow Sunnydale transplant Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter), butAngelfinally found its footing when Doyle was dispatched (giving his powers of precognition to Cordelia) and replaced byBuffyalum Wesley (Alexis Denisof), a fallen watcher who, like his friends, was hoping for a new start in L.A. However, pesky law firm Wolfram and Hart (a front for the demon mafia, as it were) reared its ugly head and discovered Angel's presence, thus setting the stage for a battle of good and evil--and if you're a regular Joss Whedon fan, you know that it's a never-ending war.This first season features guest appearances by variousBuffycharacters, including werewolf boy Oz (Seth Green), rogue slayer Faith (Eliza Dushku), deliciously evil vamp Darla (Julie Benz), and Buffy herself (Sarah Michelle Gellar), all of whom helped get the show off and running in style.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000I0QLR8", "B000I0QLRI", "B000I0QLRS", "B000I0QLS2", "B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVM8", "B000EHSVLE", "B000EHSVN2", "B000EHSVMS", "B000EHSVKK", "B000EHSVL4", "B0006IUE16", "B0009W5J4Q", "B000B5XOW0", "B0024FAR66", "B007H9CNOI", "B0046XG48O", "B000CCBCGM", "B000HD1482", "B000HT3P60", "B000QDLSR0", "B000OIOPHC", "B00344EAQO", "B000O77SMW", "B000RO6JYK", "B002JVWR4A", "B000JLTRIG", "B002DLB1H0", "B001992NWO", "B001B7CNZ6", "B0024FAD9C", "B000GG4Y28", "B00HUPC5X8", "B001UGJUSG", "B0002XVKMM", "B003L77G8I", "B000BOH986", "B000GG4Y6O", "B000ERVJM2", "B000T9OP7G", "B0053O89IS", "B00133QNSG", "B000BOH98G", "B001MVWRNO", "B001QE99AQ", "B0000AQS0F", "B002JVWR4U", "B00466H3CW", "B009LDCXNY", "B001L1S1OY", "B002N5N5MK", "B000R7I44K", "B000X5SPBI", "B001MVWRNE", "B009LDD4V4", "B00133QNRW", "B001H5X6QM", "B00006J3WH", "B00IWTVDUW", "B000AJJNFE", "1593078226", "B001FB4W0C", "B00133QNS6", "B000O77SN6", "B000F8O2Q0", "B000F3UAE8", "B00191AEYQ", "B00HUCF7AO", "B00AMDA2QC", "B000FP2OPY", "B00005JLKB", "B000FIMG4U", "B000FVQLIO", "B003F3NE1G", "B0001I55ZQ", "B000BOH990", "B000GIW9GO", "B000FIMG68", "B0002RQ3MK", "B00129W6LE", "B00062IDEW", "B00009MEJT", "B00ECXJC28", "B00005JNOG", "B000NOKFGW", "1595826106", "B001OQCVCY", "B000F8O2OM", "B009LDD5XQ", "B000OCXNQW", "B000R9YLKY", "B00IKM5LXG", "B002QZDSXI", "B00BBXSPES", "B00001R3O1", "B000R7GKQE", "B00079FUI6", "B00008KA57", "B0085KGG96", "B002BWP2JO"], "bought_together": ["B000I0QLR8", "B000I0QLRI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003YF9Q08", "B000I0QLS2", "B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVM8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 44619}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 12.17, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005JLEW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41RQ6X4K67L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Angel - Season One"}

{"description": "It's not that the folks at Pixar are geniuses when it comes to DVDs... well, come to think of it, their fifth DVD set shows these folks are wizards. It's not just that the two discs are packed with watchable extras that hardly reiterate the same information; it's how they are handled--funny, inventive, with a light touch--unlike many PR-driven discs. A good place to start is the filmmakers' jolly commentary track, which branches off into 31 minutes of behind-the-scene stuff, deleted scenes, and curious anecdotes (they can also be watched separately). Pixar's first making-of documentary is a most concise and interesting 25-minute examination that also sheds light on how the company works. With a digital-to-digital transfer, the film looks great and is available in widescreen or reformatted to full screen. The \"Family Fun\" disc includes another Pixar made-for-the-DVD gem, the 7-minute \"Exploring the Reef\" with Jean-Michel Cousteau (Jacques's son) being upstaged by Dori and Marlin; it's a hoot and teaches a fact or two you will remember about reefs. Both discs feature lovely menus that can be turned into virtual aquariums for your TV (by removing the text) featuring the knockout colors of the film's settings. Watch long enough for some shenanigans from the film's characters and vocal talent. Genius, pure genius.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00EV1YZ96", "B00AFEX83C", "B00007LVCM", "B00005JNS0", "B0030IIZ4M", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B003ZHVJGO", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00003CXB4", "B001KVZ6FW", "B0013FSL3E", "B004HO6I4M", "B00005JN4W", "B000MV9026", "B004G600A4", "B000AY74OG", "B000VBJEEG", "B0006UEVT0", "B008YWY0HK", "B003H9M1Q2", "B00CQRN3QI", "B0001I561E", "B0042U94UQ", "B00E9ZATJO", "B000YERP2S", "B0006JMLRK", "B000AAF1TU", "B0000AOX0O", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00F522C7C", "B0039N74CW", "B00003CXCQ", "B001ILFUDC", "B00275EHJG", "B001HN6922", "0736429220", "B000B8QG4A", "B000RMJ4F8", "B0084IHVN4", "B002ZG97YM", "B001ECQ75A", "B004ZBACOE", "B0030IIYYS", "B0084IHVGG", "B00E9ZATKI", "B00AO686JC", "B000GUJZ00", "B00004R99S", "B0012EM5D8", "B0084IHVUC", "B0013ND30M", "B0034JKZ86", "B0000VV4W2", "B00003CX8Y", "B008JFUQ16", "B001DPHDCY", "B00005TN8K", "B00CUDD0C0", "B00A83075M", "B001O5LVPI", "B001NCDFTW", "B00G7TIKMI", "B0000E32WJ", "B00CWM58WY", "B001ILFUD2", "B00009YXAW", "B00CMY3JBO", "B00335EQ0E", "B005LAIISA", "0783231474", "B0002YLCOM", "B00E00OGE2", "B000H7JCK0", "B000UVKGPI", "B00005JMQZ", "B00JK531ES", "B00004U9WQ", "B005LAIH4A", "B005LAIHW2", "B00024I2Z4", "B00I6JOD2S", "B008NNY9QW", "B0000VCZKM", "B00FE8BVF6", "6302526574", "B004EPZ034", "B000L22SG6", "B001OMU6UM", "B00E56D8FO", "B0000524D0", "B002WJI2QQ", "B0009CTT6U", "B000050MN3", "B000B8QG3G", "B0058AFS0O", "B00006FDAI", "B00EGIAQ1K", "B000A7G4TY"], "bought_together": ["B00EV1YZ96", "B00G5G7EXY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00EV1YZ96", "B00AFEX83C", "B00I6JOD2S", "B004HO6I4M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7746}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 25.5, "brand": "Disney", "asin": "B00005JM02", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-difUGanL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}

{"description": "There's only one deleted scene in this two-disc DVD set, but it's a doozy. The \"Sgt. Candy Scene\" is a must-see and, unfortunately, the best thing on the second disc. The rushed HBO documentary shows us far more flash than substance. Better is the Visual Effects Lab that goes more in-depth with four sequences, although you need to wade through a hokey interface for each segment. Making your \"own\" effects isn't that much fun; you can only choose a few effects that change in two scenes. Anyone looking to get the complicated backstory of the trilogy figured out should dig into the \"Sky Net Database\" and an intricate timeline. The two commentary tracks are worth a listen, with director Jonathan Mostow's solo track the better one. The director goes into great detail on how the little things (from lighting street scenes to tricks for destroying buildings) count.  The second track is pieced together from the actors recorded separately. Mostow appears with actress Claire Danes (doing her first commentary track) and their chemistry is enjoyable after a slow start. The other actors have less interesting things to say, including Schwarzenegger who is constantly--yet enthusiastically--selling the film.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5", "B001FB55HQ", "B00005JA8B", "B00070FX5U", "B00007AJG4", "B002ZG98LO", "B000T9OP7G", "B002GHHHME", "B00005JKIP", "B002QFYJFY", "B0002J58HO", "B0000AXE8I", "B001AQO43M", "B00AKGG828", "B00026ZG10", "B0001BKAEY", "B00IZZDWKM", "B001451HXO", "B0000VCZK2", "B000056PMU", "B000BPL2FQ", "B000RW3VCK", "B0004Z33F0", "B000U1ZV8K", "B0045HCJGC", "B0004Z33EQ", "B00005JNTU", "B000HRMAPE", "B00008G8M4", "B000RRS7RE", "B00005JKYX", "B0000VD12I", "B000FC2FQA", "B00000ILDG", "B00000G3PA", "B00005JMZK", "B000MGBSE4", "B0087ZG7J8", "B0004Z33EG", "B000P0J0AQ", "B00005JMEW", "B0087ZG7NO", "B00003CXTA", "B0002CHK1S", "B000RJO56E", "B00177YA1K", "B00004STDN", "B005COLETU", "B001AK3S4Y", "B000VNMMR0", "B0000959N0", "B00005JMUA", "1558908846", "6305767866", "B001RIY4WE", "B0049IHX2C", "B000VI70QS", "B000EGDB10", "B002GSXKN8", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B0045HCJ9O", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00005JNJV", "B001451HX4", "B00I9TDMRM", "B0006GANOQ", "B00003CXSP", "6305428115", "B00016MSV2", "B00005JOC9", "B000TJBN80", "B009MO57H6", "B000O77SQS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B001OST0M6", "B005LAIHXQ", "B0002J4X1Q", "B0002V7OI8", "B0015XHP2C", "6304806434", "B000QXDED6", "B00005JL3K", "B008JFUPFI", "B003PIUINS", "0783225946", "0792839056", "B00005N7Z1", "B0006GAO6I", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00005JL78", "B001HN697M", "B00IJS2OXG", "B002NXSRVG", "B00008G8M5", "B00005JN0T", "B003XURDAY", "B000O77SRM", "B006VRRGNK", "B00F4FFO8E"], "bought_together": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5", "B001FB55HQ", "B002JT6AO0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 115564}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.47, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JM0B", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5143TFPX8SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Three men relive their carefree college years by killing off as many  brain cells as possible in this over-the-top comedy. Mitch (Luke Wilson)  returns home from a less-than-pleasant business trip one evening to  discover his wife, Heidi (Juliette Lewis), involved in a m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois  with two blindfolded strangers. Feeling less than welcome at home after  this, Mitch rents a house near the campus of a nearby college; two of  Mitch's old college buddies, Beanie (Vince Vaughn) and Frank (Will  Ferrell), stop by to cheer him up. They soon become regular guests at  Mitch's place, despite the fact that Frank only recently wed Marissa  (Perrey Reeves), while Beanie and his wife, Lara (Leah Remini), are busy  with two kids. Beanie decides to throw a housewarming party for Mitch,  and since Beanie sells audio equipment for a living, he's able to trick  out the big bash with a massive PA system and an appearance by Snoop  Dogg. Mitch soon finds he's the not-entirely-willing proprietor of the  school's leading party spot, which raises the ire of Pritchard (Jeremy  Piven), a dean at the college who was the target of Mitch, Frank, and  Beanie's abuse when they were all students. Pritchard arranges to have  Mitch's neighborhood zoned into a student housing district, but Beanie  and Frank respond by forming a fraternity and making Mitch's home their  headquarters. Mitch, however, is not enthusiastic about the idea,  especially as he's trying to impress Nicole (Ellen Pompeo), a beautiful  divorcee who is less than enchanted with Frank and Beanie's \"party  hearty\" lifestyle.Old Schooldirector Todd Phillips knows more than a  bit about the seamy side of fraternity life as director of the infamous  unreleased documentaryFrat House.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BKVQS4", "B001G5T6GW", "B000J4P9P8", "B000WZEZGI", "B00005JMYI", "B00005JNZU", "B0016MOV92", "B00AEFXJS6", "B001OD4S50", "B0009HBPN0", "B002ZG99H2", "B00AEFYZCU", "B001J9KJ4I", "B00AEFYPXY", "B000EMGJAO", "B008220BGQ", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B004EPZ084", "B000JJ4DNW", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B00005JKMN", "B000069CF0", "B0000A02TZ", "B008R65XNS", "B002IKIHEG", "B00AEFYAMA", "B000BKJ762", "B003Y5H5B0", "B000IZJZIU", "B00AEBB9K0", "B000CPH9PM", "B00AEBBA2C", "B0050PYNN0", "B003CRM6PA", "B000AP04L0", "630529142X", "B00B65JMEI", "B0006GANPA", "B000TZJBPQ", "B003VPX5Y4", "B002ZG97XI", "B004EPYZS0", "B00466HN7M", "B001C0JCBA", "B0083XXVFW", "B000A7DVR2", "B00029RTAI", "B00CE00ZV8", "B005LAII12", "B00007AJGM", "B008R65XYC", "B00BEIYMZ6", "B000ELJAEM", "B008R65XTC", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEFXVW0", "B00AIQARTU", "B00003CXWV", "B000P0J09M", "B00005JMX6", "B004HO6I2E", "B002BIULKS", "B00AEFZ3XU", "B0012IWNZY", "B00BNWWYE4", "B0023TCWE8", "B00363WGBO", "0783229526", "B00AEBB9DM", "B0002V7TMY", "B000E6EHE0", "B0009X761E", "B00029RTCG", "B0002F6BRE", "B0002I84FI", "B0051MKNRC", "B003BV8IC2", "B00005JL93", "B000EGDBZ6", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00AEFYFWA", "B000P0J09W", "B00DV2MVWO", "B008R65XUQ", "B000M341QE", "B00AEBB9GY", "B00003CXPS", "B000HCPS94", "B005LAII2Q", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00AEFXIUK", "B00407PO3W", "B00AEFY5B6", "B004EPZ06G", "B004LWZW5G", "B00AEFZ8OY", "B003Y5H5C4", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEFYVMO", "B00004Z4WR"], "bought_together": ["B001G5T6GW", "B000J4P9P8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001G5T6GW", "B000WZEZGI", "B000J4P9P8", "B003Y5H5B0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 27583}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JM1F", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MFGXVNN8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Old School (Widescreen Unrated Edition)"}

{"description": "Even though it's only a single disc, the28 Days LaterDVD includes a lot of very interesting features, including the alternate ending that was shown after the end of the film a couple months into its theatrical run.  It's much bleaker, as director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland say in their optional commentary.  Another alternate ending is almost the same as the theatrical ending but slightly less happy.  Most interesting is the \"radical\" alternate ending that takes an entirely different path midway through the film.  It wasn't filmed, however, so Boyle and Garland narrate the action over storyboards, and it's a surprisingly engrossing 11 minutes.  Boyle and Garland also did a commentary track for the film, and they talk about how they were able to get the shots of deserted London and why they used the ending they did.  There are also six very watchable deleted scenes, and Boyle and Garland's comments range from \"great sequence\" to \"a disgrace.\" Slightly less relevant is a 24-minute documentary that spends its first 10 minutes on the real-life threat of infectious diseases before recapping the film and discussing such elements as the use of digital video and the boot camp the actors had to attend. If you need any further proof that the DVD was a labor of love, even the stills galleries have commentaries.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000TJBN80", "B0002ABURA", "B0006A9FKA", "B002WY65VU", "B00111YM5Q", "B0013D8LAE", "B000IHY9TS", "B000Y7U98C", "B00005JO16", "B0021L8UXA", "B0001611DI", "B0013D8LA4", "B000RJO56O", "B002JT69IW", "B001D2WU9I", "B002VWNIDG", "B0002CHK1S", "B00D7AM6M0", "B003UGLCIA", "B00AEFYYH6", "B001MVYUR0", "B000UAE7O0", "B003EYVXYG", "B000EHRVP6", "B0028DRGDQ", "B0021L8UPS", "B001NPD9LS", "B005LAIIMG", "B000FAOC2W", "B000LP6KNU", "B0006SSOHC", "B000WC3864", "B0013FDM7E", "B00000K3TO", "B000RIWAVW", "B000GCFO0I", "B000O76ZQC", "B004LWZW24", "B000RJO578", "B002VKB0KG", "B006ISJR7U", "B00004TS0G", "B004SIP9MY", "B002VKE1K2", "B00G5GNYY2", "B000N6TX1I", "B0024FADD8", "B005QUQRBU", "B001MYIXAC", "B00D3DJIG8", "B001GUYB08", "B000TGJ80S", "B000V4UFZK", "B004SIP92O", "B00009MGEM", "B0010X73ZG", "B00005K3NR", "B002LMSWN2", "B000063RQQ", "B00000ILDD", "B004BZ5AN2", "0767802519", "B00001QGUM", "B00AJLHUA8", "B002SJIO4A", "B00005JMUA", "B00J5LXT6M", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B000AXWHSA", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00005JLWN", "B004BLJQOK", "B0015ET3YO", "B008220BLG", "B000031WD9", "B000069HZP", "B000EQ5SRK", "B0007Y08QA", "B000PMLJMQ", "B000BUNZY2", "B002ZG98UA", "B000V4UH08", "B001JNNDJM", "B003HKN52U", "B003UAKEBW", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0019X3YX2", "B00CE00ZV8", "B00003CXCF", "B0009WFEDC", "B000FS9FE4", "B00005JNJV", "B00011CZRE", "B002T9H2LA", "B000RW5BZ0", "B00005JMXX", "B000WC389G", "B007STBUHI", "B002ZG983M"], "bought_together": ["B000TJBN80", "B002WY65VU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008SAPC20", "B003J42JLC", "B000Y7U98C", "B0002ABURA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 37382}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.25, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00005JMA8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511KHM89SFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "28 Days Later (Widescreen Special Edition)"}

{"description": "Like a good dream, Sofia Coppola'sLost in Translationenvelops you with an aura of fantastic light, moody sound, head-turning love, and a feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, even though you've probably never been to this neon-fused version of Tokyo. Certainly Bob Harris has not. The 50-ish actor has signed on for big money shooting whiskey ads instead of doing something good for his career or his long-distance family. Jetlagged, helplessly lost with his Japanese-speaking director, and out of sync with the metropolis, Harris (Bill Murray, never better) befriends the married but lovelorn 25-year-old Charlotte (played with heaps of poise by 18-year-old Scarlett Johansson). Even before her photographer husband all but abandons her, she is adrift like Harris but in a total entrapment of youth. How Charlotte and Bill discover they are soul mates will be cherished for years to come. Written and directed by Coppola (The Virgin Suicides), the film is far more atmospheric than plot-driven: we whiz through Tokyo parties, karaoke bars, and odd nightlife, always ending up in the impossibly posh hotel where the two are staying. The wisps of bittersweet loneliness of Bill and Charlotte are handled smartly and romantically, but unlike modern studio films, this isn't a May-November fling film. Surely and steadily, the film ends on a much-talked-about grace note, which may burn some, yet awards film lovers who \"always had Paris\" with another cinematic destination of the heart.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305428239", "B0007UC8Y4", "B000BX8R10", "B00005JMJG", "B0000640VJ", "B0010X8NF0", "B003UESJLU", "B007L6VR12", "0767821408", "B00007AJF8", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00DW5IKYS", "B001QOGYBI", "B000M06KJ8", "B00005JLRE", "B00000G02H", "B0006TPE4C", "B0007TKOAA", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00DYVUBYM", "B00H9HZITU", "B000Z8GZYW", "B004SEUIXS", "B00AEFXN9G", "B003CRM6PA", "B00008RH3J", "B000EQHXNW", "B0001I1K32", "B0008JIJ2O", "B001DJ7PR8", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0009PVZD2", "B000CS464G", "B00337KM2S", "B003102JDM", "0790734796", "B001P3SA8K", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B0000WN0SC", "B00003CWTI", "B00003CXZ4", "B00008975Z", "B0057ZAA6W", "B000IU37SO", "B00004RJ73", "B00AEFXGIY", "B007P9HW3M", "B005MYEQ4U", "B000K7VHQE", "B00005JNC2", "B00079Z9VO", "B000063JDE", "B0001US61O", "B0000WN15O", "B00G7QPXUI", "B0041KKYEM", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00006LPGP", "B0006H32EI", "B00005JKJA", "B00AEFYCL4", "B000KX0IOK", "B002T9H2LA", "B001TOD92C", "B004XVMCKS", "B00AEBB9CS", "B008220DGE", "0767802519", "B000069HYF", "B007D5E7C2", "B000M7XRAG", "B004U7MR14", "B003O7I6SE", "B000A7DVR2", "B005LAIIJY", "B00A81MV3U", "B000055Y0X", "B00005V9HH", "B000E33VWW", "0783225903", "B00AEFXE9U", "B000N6TX1I", "B00CIOD6HK", "B0021L8UOY", "B004SIP95G", "B000PAAJZ6", "B002ZG980U", "B007UW9WOQ", "B00GKOJ98E", "B0014D5RBE", "B00011CZRE", "B001HN699A", "B000M4RG7E", "B003ELKNH2", "0767802535", "B00121QGPY", "B004FQX5B6", "6305609764", "B0009A40ES"], "bought_together": ["B0007UC8Y4", "6305428239"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00JAQJMJ0", "B007L6VR12", "B001QOGYBI", "B0010X8NF0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2901}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.77, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JMJ4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518vLN4%2B7KL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lost in Translation"}

{"description": "Batman Beginsdiscards the previous four films in the series and recasts the Caped Crusader as a fearsome avenging angel. That's good news, because the series, which had gotten off to a rousing start under Tim Burton, had gradually dissolved into self-parody by 1997'sBatman & Robin. As the title implies,Batman Beginstells the story anew, when Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) flees Western civilization following the murder of his parents. He is taken in by a mysterious instructor named Ducard (Liam Neeson in another mentor role) and urged to become a ninja in the League of Shadows, but he instead returns to his native Gotham City resolved to end the mob rule that is strangling it. But are there forces even more sinister at hand?Cowritten by the team of David S. Goyer (a veteran comic book writer) and director Christopher Nolan (Memento),Batman Beginsis a welcome return to the grim and gritty version of the Dark Knight, owing a great debt to the graphic novels that preceded it. It doesn't have the razzle dazzle, or the mass appeal, ofSpider-Man 2(though the Batmobile is cool), and retelling the origin means it starts slowly, like most \"first\" superhero movies. But it's certainly the best Bat-film since Burton's original, and one of the best superhero movies of its time. Bale cuts a good figure as Batman, intense and dangerous but with some of the lightheartedness Michael Keaton brought to the character. Michael Caine provides much of the film's humor as the family butler, Alfred, and as the love interest, Katie Holmes (Dawson's Creek) is surprisingly believable in her first adult role. Also featuring Gary Oldman as the young police officer Jim Gordon, Morgan Freeman as a Q-like gadgets expert, and Cillian Murphy as the vile Jonathan Crane.--David HoriuchiBatmanat Amazon.comAllBatmanDVDsBatman Begins101: A Comic Book PrimerWhere Have I Seen Christian Bale?AllBatmanComics and Graphic NovelsBatmanToysBatman BeginsSoundtrackStills fromBatman Begins(click for larger images)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA", "B002GSXKN8", "B000P0J06U", "B001OST0LW", "B000P0J06K", "B004EPZ07K", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00005JKCH", "B001GCUO1Q", "B002ZG980U", "B001OST0M6", "B008JFUPFI", "B004LWZWFQ", "B00005JMQW", "B004LWZW42", "B000VI70QS", "B001DHXT20", "B000M341QE", "B0000959N0", "B000UR9T8C", "B00005JNTU", "B000AYELVA", "B00E5I2M6I", "B002IPFWTE", "B000HEVZ9E", "B0090SI56Y", "B002HWRYJE", "B0006L0LOS", "B000OVLBF8", "B00003CWT6", "B000VR0570", "B00E5I2MEK", "B000HCO83Q", "B0007P0Y7C", "B008JFUO72", "B00F4FFO8E", "B001CDR1FG", "B000P0J0EW", "B002T9H2LA", "B0002KVUKM", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00005N5S5", "B0083SBMBM", "B0001BKAEY", "B00AQSN7HE", "B000J10EQU", "B00005JKZY", "B002NXSRVG", "B000AYELVU", "B001OQCV6A", "B004LWZW4M", "B001VLBDD0", "B001GZ6QEC", "B004GJYRA0", "B007REV4T8", "B001TK80C0", "B000HRJLII", "B001QTXM5Y", "B005G4TJUC", "B00005JKZV", "B0053FANT0", "B00005JA8B", "B003YAR97K", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00001ZWUS", "B004EPYZQC", "B001N44BVQ", "B006VRRGNK", "B001AEF6HM", "B00000JQB5", "B00011CZRE", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00AEFY0F2", "B007K3JFUQ", "B0002IQMAM", "B00005JN0T", "B002SJIO4A", "B000VWYJ86", "B0013FDM7E", "B00005JNTI", "B00407PNY2", "B00DTPRZ24", "B008JFUS0U", "B00004Z4WR", "B000FS9FCG", "B000QXDED6", "B0085A9HU6", "0780624890", "B00005LOUK", "B000065U1N", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005JN5T", "B001QB9H1U", "B00005JMUA", "0792844890", "B0007DFJ0G", "B004EPYZSK", "B008JFUOWM", "B00AEFY5B6"], "bought_together": ["B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009JBWOU0", "B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA", "B002ZG980U"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7806}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.99, "brand": "DC Comics", "asin": "B00005JNJV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518zjc4XtzL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Batman Begins (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Despite super effects, a huge budget, and the cinematic pedigree of alien-happy Steven Spielberg, this take on H.G. Wells's novel is basically a horror film packaged as a sci-fi thrill ride. Instead of a mad slasher, however, Spielberg (along with writers Josh Friedman & David Koepp) utilizes aliens hell-bent on quickly destroying humanity, and the terrifying results that prey upon adult fears, especially in the post-9/11 world. The realistic results could be a new genre, the grim popcorn thriller; often you feel like you're watching Schindler's List more than Spielberg's other thrill-machine movies (Jaws,Jurassic Park). The film centers on Ray Ferrier, a divorced father (Tom Cruise, oh so comfortable) who witnesses one giant craft destroy his New Jersey town and soon is on the road with his teen son (Justin Chatwin) and preteen daughter (Dakota Fanning) in tow, trying to keep ahead of the invasion. The film is, of course, impeccably designed and produced by Spielberg's usual crew of A-class talent. The aliens are genuinely scary, even when the film--like the novel--spends a good chunk of time in a basement. Readers of the book (or viewers of the deft 1953 adaptation) will note the variation of whom and how the aliens come to Earth, which poses some logistical problems. The film opens and closes with narration from the novel read by Morgan Freeman, but Spielberg could have adapted Orson Welles's words from the famous Halloween Eve 1938 radio broadcast: \"We couldn't soap all your windows and steal all your garden gates by tomorrow night, so we did the best next thing: we annihilated the world.\"--Doug ThomasWar of the Worldsat Amazon.comThe SoundtrackThe War of the Worlds(1953)War of the Worlds - The Complete First Season(TV series)Classic Sci-Fi Movies and Their RemakesAliens Invade on DVDThe Prog-rock Opera (no kidding)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B00005JL78", "B001SGEUYW", "B00008G8M4", "B00005JL3T", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AEFXNLY", "B00005JMXX", "B001OQCV2E", "B000VECAD0", "B002O3Z510", "B0002V7OI8", "B000H30B2C", "B000EGDB10", "B00005JN2Z", "B005LAIIMG", "B005PTYP70", "B002O3Z50G", "B0002V7ON8", "B00005JN0T", "B00K2CHW48", "B002SJIO4A", "0783225547", "B008JFUO36", "B00005JKLZ", "B00AS1Q93S", "1936594056", "B004EPYZUS", "B001TUZG4K", "B00AEFXR1K", "B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFXYJA", "0767817478", "B0034G4ORC", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00070FX5U", "B0045HCJSA", "B00000G3PA", "B005LAIHPE", "B003Y5H5GK", "B00AEBBA72", "B00003CWU3", "B00I9TDMRM", "B001ECDVKE", "B00003CXXP", "B000V4UFZK", "B0010X73ZG", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00005JKFR", "B000XT1P4S", "B003HKN52U", "B0009PW4D2", "B000HRMAPE", "B004EPYZPS", "B0018QPPXW", "B0002WZTOI", "B00AEBB9LO", "B004LWZW4M", "B003ABZHAO", "B003YJFALS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B000OT6V64", "B004P7CN7W", "B000CCBC9O", "B00000ILDD", "0767803434", "B001L57ZYM", "B000065V3G", "B007STBUHI", "B002ZG980U", "B008JFUQZ2", "B00005B6JZ", "B0006GANOQ", "B000F1IQN2", "1494343576", "B001GCUO02", "B00004Y87O", "0783226810", "B004EPYZSK", "B000P0J0BU", "B005LAIHXQ", "B001680M26", "B000EQHXN2", "B0045HCJFS", "B00004BZIY", "B00008G8M5", "B00003CXQA", "B008JFUS0U", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00EIN6KJ0", "B0000DZ6N3", "B000MV8A9A", "B00005JKYX", "B0000YEEGM", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B0013FCWUW", "B002ZG9864", "B00003CWTI", "B008MIMWQW", "B00IKM5OCO"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBB8VK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B004LWZW4M", "B00005JL78", "B004EPYZSK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18739}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JNTI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51upxzPRnXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "War of the Worlds"}

{"description": "The delightful designs of William Joyce (writer/illustrator of such popular children's books asGeorge ShrinksandBently & Egg) makeRobotsa joy to behold. The round, bouncy, and ramshackle forms of hero Rodney Copperbottom and his computer-animated friends are part of an ornate and daffyFender providing assistance.Rube-Goldberg universe of elaborate contraptions and gleaming metallic surfaces.  Rodney (voiced with a hint-of-Scottish lilt by Ewan McGregor) is a young inventor who sets off for Robot City to work for Big Weld (Mel Brooks), the supreme inventor of the mechanical world.  But upon his arrival, Rodney discovers that Big Weld has disappeared, and the slick, shiny Ratchet (Greg Kinnear,As Good As It Gets) is phasing out the spare parts that lumpen robots need to function and replacing them with \"upgrades\"--expensive and glistening new exoskeletons. Unfortunately, from this suitable beginning, the story degenerates into a series of action sequences that make very little sense, though some are kinetic and fun (though others are only there to serve the inevitableRobotsvideo game). Most kids will enjoy the sheer visual pleasure of the movie, but compared to the narrative richness of Pixar movies likeThe IncrediblesandToy Story, that pleasure is pretty short-lived. Also featuring the voices of Robin Williams, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Amanda Bynes, Jennifer Coolidge, and many, many more.--Bret FetzerDVD FeaturesJennifer Coolidge returns as the voice of Aunt Fanny in a mildly amusing new short, \"Aunt Fanny's Tour of Booty,\" which allows her to again be the butt of the joke.  Fans of the characters will enjoy both a 17-minute discussion of the robots' creation as well as profiles of 11 of the bots, including early, almost unrecognizable conceptual sketches and brief interviews with the voice cast.  The original short is fairly dull, and of the three deleted scenes, the most finished is an extended version of Rodney's initial meeting with Tim at the gate.  One other is in sketch form only but does preserve another performance by Robin Williams.  The kids' games are pretty good.  There's a dancing robot that will perform eight routines on command or in random order.  A memory game has a bit of replay value, and the build-a-bot segment takes some thought and investigation.  The Xbox demo is a nifty little diversion that transforms one element (the transport-pod race) of the full-length, single-player Xbox game into a frenetic one- to four-player free-for-all.In their commentary track, director Chris Wedge and producer-inspiration William Joyce have to remind each other to stop patting themselves on the back, but it is interesting to hear them talk about old games such as Mousetrap that played a part in developing the film.  (Wedge's frequent references to a possible \"director's cut\" might not seem like a joke to DVD buyers who have gotten tired of DVD rereleases.)  The commentary track by the Blue Sky technical team might be better, offering insights into the characters and the creation of the film without lapsing into too much techie-speak.--David HoriuchiStills fromRobots(click for larger image)The World ofRobotsThe Art of RobotsRobotssoundtrackRobotsscoreRobotsfor XboxRobotsfor PS2Robotsfor GBA", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006JMLRK", "B000M343BC", "B002WJI2QQ", "B001DPHDCY", "B0012EM5D8", "B004HO6I4M", "B00003CXJ4", "B00CWM58WY", "B000MV9026", "B0006UEVT0", "B001GCUO7A", "0783231474", "B005SDUV4E", "B000RMJ4F8", "B0000640SC", "B000ROAK2W", "B0013FSL3E", "B001LPWGFA", "B004EPZ034", "B001U3D88M", "B000ION23A", "B005LAIISA", "B0000AOX0O", "B000UFIYOO", "B001PR0YEE", "6305161887", "B00029LO0Y", "B008NNY9QW", "B000G75AZC", "B000H7JCK0", "B006JD48LO", "B000L22SG6", "B00B7EQPNE", "B001ECQ75A", "B004AKCME8", "B000AY74OG", "B000VBJEEG", "B00F522C7C", "B000DWMYQ8", "B002ZG97YM", "B008JFUQ16", "B004LWZW7Y", "B000BITUVG", "B0000VV4W2", "B005LAIH4A", "B00003CXG7", "B00005JMQZ", "B00007LVCM", "B0042U94UQ", "B00CHVJODE", "B001PR0Y7Q", "B00E9ZATJO", "B00009M9BK", "0449810798", "B0090SI1RM", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B001KVZ6FW", "1620575175", "B009AMAH3O", "B00I6JOD2S", "B000CZ0PT4", "B0013FSWT2", "B0034G4OYA", "B00AFEX83C", "B000UVKGPI", "B000065V42", "B0039N74CW", "B00JK531ES", "B00HLTD2OE", "B002ZG9904", "B00009YXAW", "6305123454", "B005FLSZQU", "B00005JM7T", "B001GCUNWQ", "B003UESJF6", "B00E00OGE2", "B001HN6918", "B000GUJZ00", "B00I0VTOMG", "B00005JNS0", "B00365F6I2", "B000EQ5UHS", "B000LPS2VI", "B00005JN4W", "B000B8QFYG", "B001NCDFTW", "B0030ZIZRC", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00G5G7EXY", "B007FF3HQM", "B00947N6D8", "B00EBBGLFC", "B005QODEEE", "B00ALMNCLQ", "B00362RUX4", "B00005JN0T", "B000GIXEWC", "B00005TN8K", "B005LAIIT4"], "bought_together": ["B00CWM58WY", "B004HO6I4M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00CWM58WY", "B004HO6I4M", "B002WJI2QQ", "B001DPHDCY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3335}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "Fox Home Entertainment", "asin": "B00005JNQS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61RM90ARRPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Robots (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "More than a few critics hailedSpider-Man 2as \"the best superhero movie ever,\" and there's no compelling reason to argue--thanks to a bigger budget, better special effects, and a dynamic, character-driven plot, it's a notch aboveSpider-Manin terms of emotional depth and rich comic-book sensibility.Ordinary PeopleOscar-winner Alvin Sargent received screenplay credit, and celebrated author and comic-book expert Michael Chabon worked on the story, but it's director Sam Raimi's affinity for the material that bringsSpidey 2to vivid life. When a fusion experiment goes terribly wrong, a brilliant physicist (Alfred Molina) is turned into Spidey's newest nemesis, the deranged, mechanically tentacled \"Doctor Octopus,\" obsessed with completing his experiment and killing Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) in the process. Even more compelling is Peter Parker's urgent dilemma: continue his burdensome, lonely life of crime-fighting as Spider-Man, or pursue love and happiness with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst)? Molina's outstanding as a tragic villain controlled by his own invention, and the action sequences are nothing less than breathtaking, but the real success ofSpider-Man 2is its sense of priorities. With all of Hollywood's biggest and best toys at his disposal, Raimi and his writers stay true to the Marvel mythology, honoringSpider-Mancreators Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, and setting the bar impressively high for the challenge ofSpider-Man 3.--Jeff ShannonDVD Features:The first commentary track is by director Sam Raimi and a self-deprecating Tobey Maguire speaking in tandem, and producer (and Marvel CEO) Avi Arad and coproducer Grant Curtis speaking in tandem. They discuss a number of topics, including Raimi's memory of his excitement over Richard Donner's Superman and how the character of Black Cat had to be dropped from the film. The second commentary is by six members of the Oscar-nominated effects team, and one of their primary focuses is how Doc Ock's arms were achieved by a combination of puppetry and CGI.The centerpiece of the second disc is a massive two-hour documentary that can be viewed all at once or in 12 separate pieces. It covers the development of the story, the visual effects, costumes, stunts, and sound and music. Three shorter featurettes cover Peter Parker's struggle between his personal and hero lives, Doc Ock, and the women in Spider-Man's life, and what's interesting is how they discuss those topics not just in relation to the movies but to the comic books as well. (For example, Betty Brant and Gwen Stacy had a much greater impact in the comics.) There's a scene in which you can toggle among three different camera angles, and a gallery of 17 paintings Alex Ross created for the opening sequence. The sound and picture are spectacular, though only theSuperbit editionhas DTS.--David HoriuchiMore Spiderman on DVDTheSpidermanToy StoreThe First FilmSpider Manon the small screenThe SoundtrackGame Boy AdvanceThe BookMore Superheroes on DVDBatmanBladeThe HulkJimmy NeutronJustice LeagueKim PossibleRobocopSpider-ManSupermanWonder WomanX-MenAlso see our Action & Adventure StoreStills fromSpider-Man 2(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000UR9T8C", "B00005JKCH", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00005JNTU", "B000VI70QS", "B001CDR1FG", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000AYELVA", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000AYELVU", "B008JFUO72", "B0083SBMBM", "B004LWZW42", "B004EPZ07K", "B00005JNJV", "B0002IQMAM", "B00E5I2MEK", "B000OVLBF8", "B00E5I2M9K", "B000HEVZ9E", "B008QZ5PY2", "B000HCO83Q", "B00JPS7HOA", "B001QB9H1U", "B00IGVJGYQ", "B0000959N0", "B0007P0Y7C", "B002GSXKN8", "B008JFUPFI", "B000J10EQU", "B0007V6ITE", "B0090SI56Y", "B001GZ6QC4", "6307397594", "B008JFUS0U", "B000IJ79VQ", "B000VR0570", "B002ZG99B8", "B00005JKWJ", "B004LWZWGA", "B005G4TJUC", "B002IPFWTE", "B00005JM5E", "B005LAIGW8", "0767817478", "B000H30B2C", "B002A5EBLW", "B0006L0LOS", "B000U7WV1Y", "B0000VCZLG", "B000P0J06K", "B002GSXKNI", "B002HWRYJE", "B0004Z33EQ", "B0009A409S", "B001DJLD2G", "B000I0RQVI", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B0007RT9MG", "B001GKJ2E8", "B0000AXE8I", "B007K3JFUQ", "B00004STUL", "B00BEZTMFY", "B000P0J06U", "B000957O82", "1402778007", "B0039N74CW", "B003UESJF6", "B00F4FFO8E", "B001HN697M", "B001OST0LW", "B0060FXDCG", "B0049IHX2C", "B000P0J0A6", "B000CEVC9M", "B000UVKGPI", "B009JBWOU0", "B00005JM5B", "B00I6JOD2S", "B001EDVNNU", "B000O77SRC", "B0000633UA", "B000P6XQ50", "B000E8M0VA", "B00008G8M4", "B000EGDB10", "B007REV4T8", "B00BPA2PEI", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B005OY6LBE", "0780624890", "B002935GMS", "0767803434", "6305428042", "B000O78KW4", "B009HIKAN8"], "bought_together": ["B000UR9T8C", "B00005JKCH"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004LWZWFQ", "B003YAR97K", "B00005JKCH", "B000UR9T8C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9593}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.0, "brand": "Marvel Kids", "asin": "B00005JMQW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51529JJX43L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Spider-Man 2 (Widescreen Special Edition)"}
{"description": "Critics and controversy aside,The Da Vinci Codeis a verifiable blockbuster. Combine the film's huge worldwide box-office take with over 100 million copies of Dan Brown's book sold, andThe Da Vinci Codehas clearly made the leap from pop-culture hit to a certifiable franchise. The leap for any story making the move from book to big screen, however, is always more perilous. In the case ofThe Da Vinci Code, the plot is concocted of such a preposterous formula of elements that you wouldn&#x92;t envy screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, the man tasked with making this story filmable. The script followsDan Brown&#x92;s bookas closely as possible while incorporating a few needed changes, including a better ending. And if you&#x92;re like most of the world, by now you&#x92;ve read the book and know how it goes: while lecturing in Paris, noted Harvard Professor of Symbology Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is summoned to the Louvre by French police to help decipher a bizarre series of clues left at the scene of the murder of the chief curator. Enter Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), gifted cryptologist. Neveu and Langdon team up to solve the mystery, and from there the story is propelled across Europe, ballooning into a modern-day mini-quest for the Holy Grail, where secret societies are discovered, codes are broken, and murderous albino monks are thwarted&#x85; oh, and alternative theories about the life of Christ and the beginnings of Christianity are presented too, of course. It&#x92;s not the typical formula for a stock Hollywood thriller. In fact, taken solely as a mystery, the movie almost works--despite some gaping holes--mostly just because it keeps moving. Brown&#x92;s greatest trick was  to have the entire story take place in one day, so the action is forced to keep moving, despite some necessary pauses for exposition. As a screen couple, Hanks and Tautou are just fine together but not exactly memorable; meanwhile Sir Ian McKellen&#x92;s scenery-chewing as pivotal character Sir Leigh Teabing is just what the film needed to keep it from taking itself too seriously. The whole thing is like a good roller-coaster ride: try not to think too much about it--just sit back and enjoy the trip.--Daniel VanciniVisit The Da Vinci Code StoreOn The DVDThe DVD extras on a film as popular asThe Da Vinci Codeshould be plentiful, and this version doesn&#x92;t skimp. With over 90 minutes of special features, including ten behind-the-scenes featurettes, there&#x92;s a lot here to explore beyond the film itself. The question is, is there anything new here that we haven&#x92;t heard before, in all the hype, pseudo-documentaries, and controversy surrounding the movie, to make it worthwhile?  For most viewers, the answer will be \"yes.\" Essentially, if you like the movie, if you enjoyed the book, you will get a lot out of them.Just as the movie is intended to make the book come to life, the DVD extras should make the film come to life by pointing the audience into the world of the filmmakers, connecting the dots between print and film, and for the most part they do just that. The extras here range from the typical look behind-the-scenes to more in-depth features on the supporting characters, the locations, and theMona Lisaherself.  \"First Day on the Set with Ron Howard\" features the director gushing about the opportunity to film in the Louvre and work with Tom Hanks again (the two worked together before onSplashandApollo 13). It&#x92;s a short piece that doesn&#x92;t reveal much beyond making an attempt to share Howard&#x92;s excitement (with the \"Gee, I really loved working with him/her on this project\" that you hear in every such featurette), but viewers might enjoy seeing how the stage was set up in the famous museum, down to the spike tape on the floor showing actors where to hit their marks.The Filmmaking Experience, Parts 1 and 2further explores the creative and technical aspects of the filmmaking process.A Conversation with Dan Brownstarts out feeling like a puff-piece (the man who wrote this book got started at age 5 with a story calledThe Giraffe, The Pig, and the Pants on Fire. \"It was a thriller,\" he says.) and unfortunately it doesn&#x92;t go very deep into much of anything of interest. But on the other hand, this isn&#x92;t60 Minuteshere; it&#x92;s intended to give viewers a better sense of the man behind the franchise, which it does.  Much of the footage from this interview is sprinkled throughout some of the other featurettes. Meanwhile, the character behind the franchise, Robert Langdon, is examined in his own featurette, as is Sophie Neveu. The cool thing here is getting under the skin of the actors to see how they approached the characters, knowing that most of the movie-going public already has formed their own ideas about the characters from the book.The most interesting extras are the featurettes that focus on the history behind the mystery. Or is it the mystery behind the history?  Either way, the first one on theMona Lisa, and the second featurette on the many codes and symbols that are hidden throughout the movie balance out the remainder of the extras nicely by demonstrating the sense of intrigue, mystery, and game-playing adventure that madeThe Da Vinci Codeso popular in the first place.--Daniel VanciniBeyondThe Da Vinci CodeThe Films of Tom HanksThe Films of Ron HowardThe Da Vinci DVDs: Decoding \"The Da Vinci Code\"More About The ArtistStills fromThe Da Vinci Code(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00005JN5E", "B0013BM63O", "B002ZTQVKM", "B0007XG02W", "B001OLP2TI", "B002C68WNW", "0307474275", "B002O5M4SU", "B00005JLSB", "B000PHVZNE", "B0077ATSSQ", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000EPR7NE", "0743486226", "B001LMAK9W", "B000P0J0EW", "0385504209", "B005HWAOP2", "B001OQCV2E", "B0013XZ2QK", "B001EZE5D8", "B00005JL3T", "B000EOTW0Q", "6304711891", "B000YDBPAM", "0307950689", "B000HT386M", "B00008G8M4", "B000P0J0EM", "B002ZG99KO", "0800141806", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00001ZWUS", "B0002V7OI8", "B002O3Z50Q", "B0006GANOQ", "B002NZK5UU", "B000NQRR1Q", "0385504225", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00005Y71F", "B000OYC7BW", "B00DL48BM6", "B00026ZG10", "B0018CWW5K", "B00004BZIY", "B0000B1OFL", "B00023B1LC", "B000N6U0E2", "B00A8MGIZG", "B00005JM5E", "B002LMV7R0", "B00004Z4WR", "B000K2UGXO", "B00005JMYC", "B001MVYUQG", "B00005JLWN", "B000056PMU", "B0000AOV4I", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00441GYXS", "B001F12J0C", "B00ES28X3C", "B002ZG980U", "B001VLBDD0", "B00008K76U", "B001TK80C0", "B008JFURII", "B000VWYJ86", "0792159659", "B00AEFYGBA", "B0009MDPYM", "B00177YA1K", "B00005N5S5", "B0043X1FM2", "B0002J58HO", "B00005JM5B", "B00AZMFJYA", "B003AWRMBA", "074349346X", "B003VA3JUO", "0783240295", "6305767866", "B0000844I8", "B000065U1N", "B002GHHHKQ", "B000K7VHQE", "B0000AXE8I", "0800177258", "B000ASDFGI", "B003Q6D2B4", "B000HRMAPE", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JMOW", "B00GPWEPZ8", "0312944926", "B000VI70QS", "B000KF0GWW"], "bought_together": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00005JN5E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00I563DSC", "B0013BM63O", "1400079152"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7555}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.5, "brand": "DaVinci", "asin": "B00005JOC9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SLBDLMtIL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Da Vinci Code (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)"}

{"description": "The supercharged possibilities of a single set and two amped-up actors are explored inHard Candy, a twisted cocktail with a poison kicker. After a flirtatious encounter in an online chat room, two people agree to meet for coffee:  a 32-year-old man (Patrick Wilson) and a 14-year-old girl (Ellen Page). They quickly advance to his house, and just as quickly, the apparent pedophilic seduction morphs into something else entirely. After the tables turn,Hard Candybecomes a tale of revenge and torture that might have tempted a filmmaker like Park Chanwook. Here, first-time feature director David Slade opts for a slick look that stays close to the actors, and you can't really blame him--this movie is like a conceptual, more-than-slightly unbelievable off-Broadway play, a showcase for actors and \"controversial\" ideas. Those actors are strong:  Patrick Wilson (Angels in America,Phantom of the Opera) is every bit as creepy as he needs to be, and Ellen Page has nothing short of a triumph. The Canadian actress was around 18 when she shot the film, but looks like an adolescent, which makes her authoritative wrath all the more shocking to witness. The provocations ofHard Candysometimes seem arbitrary or forced, but Page's electrifying performance can't be denied, or dismissed.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0017VG5XM", "B00177YA6U", "B002VPTJOA", "B000ARFPMQ", "B004U7MR3W", "B0037E8HOC", "B00DVD5STQ", "B000YABYLA", "B00187FPC2", "B001MEJY8W", "B000WC38EQ", "B0013D8L7M", "B002EOVXBK", "B000FVQM2Y", "B000UCD4L0", "B00009MEC4", "B0051PLQR0", "6305313687", "B001G9CNI6", "B005Z9MGRG", "B003U6SJY0", "B008NNY8XQ", "B00125WATQ", "B0014VPFVS", "B00006AUIG", "B00DMUFXOS", "B001J4E19C", "B002VPTJNQ", "B00000I1KK", "B003L20IEC", "B004OUZLGK", "B000N3SU92", "B00699G622", "B00005Q4CS", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JMJG", "B008G1JIQC", "B0021L8UPS", "B00441GYVK", "B0007PID84", "B000NO39FG", "B00B96TGQS", "B001B187L6", "B000OYCMLM", "B005SQRYB4", "B0000AOX0A", "B000A2X3U2", "B00G5GNYY2", "B008G33PIM", "B0020LH8WU", "6305428484", "B000MMMTBY", "B002LMSWN2", "B007CZ3E7C", "B002USF1WC", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00005U14H", "0767802519", "B00AEFY2AA", "B0001GF2D8", "B001D2WU9I", "B00009W0U4", "B0000694XX", "B004LWZW24", "B0083QN87K", "B004Z1HY2W", "B000HC2LFI", "B0002J4X1Q", "B0000CABGW", "B007L6VRBM", "B0001EFUFK", "B003626TNG", "B009XTF8KQ", "B00ELQHX5O", "B007UW9W8W", "B001JNNDJM", "157362408X", "B0058ZPNOK", "B000EOTVU2", "B0082CWTSY", "B00AZTUUQK", "B001C5LLVE", "B000PKG8TM", "B00003CWQR", "B00007976U", "B001CDFY64", "B004XVMCH6", "B00003CWN3", "B0028DRGDQ", "B000FS2W3A", "B001U0HBQA", "B000N3AW6G", "B00005QAOZ", "B00BSU0FQA", "B00003CXKM", "B0002MPQRS", "B00BEIYGT8", "B0004Z31OS", "B001AZKB8K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002VPTJOA", "B00177YA6U", "B001MEJY8W", "B0017VG5XM"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 421858}, "asin": "B00005JP3W", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FEBBE1B9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hard Candy"}
{"description": "Helen Mirren reigns supreme inThe Queen, a witty and ingenious look at a moment that rocked the house of Windsor:  the week that followed the sudden death of Princess Diana in 1997. Diana's death came at just the same time that Prime Minister Tony Blair (played by the bright Michael Sheen) was settling into his new government--and trying to figure out the delicate relationship between 10 Downing Street and Queen Elizabeth II (Mirren). A large portion of the British population was trying to figure out the Windsors that week, as Elizabeth remained stiff-upper-lip and largely mum about the death of the beloved princess. In Peter Morgan's skillful script, we watch as Blair grows increasingly impatient with the Royals, who are sequestered in their Scottish estate while the public demands some show of grief. Prince Philip (James Cromwell, in good form) clumsily decides to take Diana's sons hunting, while a sympathetically-treated Prince Charles (Alex Jennings) displays some frustration with his mother's eerie calm.None of this conveys how funny the film is, or how deftly it flows from one scene to the next. Director Stephen Frears (Dirty Pretty Things) deserves great credit for that, and for the performances, and for the movie's marvelous sense of well-roundedness; you could see this movie and groan at the cluelessness of the Royals and their outmoded existence, or you might just sympathize with showing reserve in a world that values gross public displays of emotion. But either way, you'll marvel at Mirren, who makes the Queen far more alert and human than one might ever have imagined.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B003UESJH4", "B001C4AFOY", "B004M9QNVK", "B004GXKBDI", "B0059XTUVI", "B000Z8H0IC", "B000ZOXDFA", "B000RF7XYO", "B001L57ZZG", "B001TH92N4", "B000BKDNX0", "B0006Q93H4", "B000EOTELI", "B004XYOQU4", "B009TT0BSE", "B0012QE4Q2", "B001QUF3SW", "B007HW8U2Y", "B000EHQUGC", "B00342ANSA", "B004SIP9U6", "B000V02CNW", "B00005O7N8", "B00GM7STPI", "B003N9ASF2", "B002ZG99EK", "B004SIP71M", "B003Y5H4Y8", "B0001I55M4", "B001AZIRVI", "B00015HXDG", "B000E1NXJ0", "B000RF7XYY", "B00121QGPY", "B009AMANBA", "B000M06KJ8", "B000MEYJHY", "B00005JOFQ", "B007TBJUVI", "B0085A9JXG", "B003AND1SM", "B000NIVJF4", "B0010X73Z6", "B000K7VHQE", "B00005JKNF", "B000MCH5P4", "B001TR4G6W", "B004P7CNZO", "B0050PYNN0", "B000GH3CR0", "B00AEFY8MM", "B0068MNO4S", "B002RSDW80", "B001MVWFAO", "B004ZNFTDQ", "B000255LIY", "B000V6LSOA", "B00ARX2VZW", "B000G6BM0K", "B008220C38"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003UESJH4", "B004M9QNVK", "B001C4AFOY", "B004GXKBDI"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPAM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K34G0GCBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Queen"}
{"description": "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's Endis a rollicking voyage in the same spirit of the two earlierPiratesfilms, yet far darker in spots (and nearly three hours to boot). The action, largely revolving around a pirate alliance against the ruthless East India Trading Company, doesn't disappoint, though the violence is probably too harsh for young children. Through it all, the plucky cast (Keira Knightley, Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush) are buffeted by battle, maelstroms, betrayal, treachery, a ferocious Caribbean weather goddess, and that gnarly voyage back from the world's end--but with their wit intact. As always, Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow tosses off great lines ; he chastises \"a woman scorned, like which hell hath no fury than!\" He insults an opponent with a string of epithets, ending in \"yeasty codpiece.\"!In the previousThe Curse of the Black Pearl, Sparrow was killed--sent to Davy Jones' Locker. In the opening scenes, the viewer sees that death has  not been kind to Sparrow--but that's not to say he hasn't found endless ways to amuse himself, cavorting with dozens of hallucinated versions of himself on the deck of the Black Pearl. But Sparrow is needed in this world, so a daring rescue brings him back. Keith Richards' much ballyhooed appearance as Jack's dad is little more than a cameo, though he does play a wistful guitar. But the action, as always, is more than satisfying, held together by Depp, who, outsmarting the far-better-armed British yet again, causes a bewigged commander to muse: \"Do you think he plans it all out, or just makes it up as he goes along?\" As far as fans are concerned, it matters not.--A.T. HurleyOn the DVDHere's something you can't say about just any DVD extras: There appears to bemoreof Keith Richards in the outtakes, interviews, and other special features on theAt World's Enddisc than in the actual film. For those scenes alone, this special edition is well worth the price. Richards looks as woozy and gamey as all the rumors suggested, and answers questions he's not asked, with Johnny Depp sitting next to him, almost acting as a translator. Richards offers pithy comments like, \"Everything I do is original, you better believe,\" and smiles when other cast members call him \"Two-Take Richards\" for supposedly nailing his scenes.The packed second disc also includes a terrific mini-doc on how the filmmakers created the famous maelstrom, in an enormous hanger in Palmdale, California, with the ships floating 30 feet off the ground. \"Just moving theBlack Pearlwas an enormous undertaking,\" says producer Jerry Bruckheimer with serious understatement. Other cool extras include \"Tale of the Many Jacks,\" deleted scenes with great commentary, \"The World of Chow Yun-Fat,\" a bio of composer Hans Zimmer, features on the set designers, a look at the impressive Brethren Court, and some hilarious bloopers. \"You can't curse in a Disney film,\" deadpans Depp when a costar blurts out something blue. \"See? I told him.\" The extras are truly as much of a rollicking adventure as the film.--A.T.

The castaways on Moonbase Alpha, led by Commander John Koenig (Martin Landau), continue their drift through the universe, where they encounter fantastic planets, oddball races, and cataclysmic perils. In \"Collision Course,\" Koenig must rely on \"a thing called faith\" when the moon seems headed for a too-close encounter with a massive planet. Unfortunately, the faith of his crew, including Chief Medical Officer Dr. Helena Russell (Landau'sMission: Impossiblecostar and then wife Barbara Bain) and Professor Victor Bergman (Barry Morse, who relentlessly pursued David Janssen onThe Fugitive) is lacking, and they mutiny. In \"Death's Other Dominion,\" the Alphans arrive at an ice-encrusted \"lost paradise\" planet, on which survivors of \"the Uranus expedition of 1986\" seek the secret of eternal life, and dissidents rise up to stop them. \"The Full Circle\" explores the nature of man when the Alphans encounter a race of cave dwellers. In \"End of Eternity,\" the Alphans learn not to \"interfere with other people's justice\" when they unwittingly free an evil and quite unstoppable alien  (Peter Bowles, much more civilized as Penelope Keith's friendly nemesis in the popular BritcomTo the Manor Born. The cautionary \"War Games\" might better be called \"Mind Games,\" as Commander Koenig considers whether to launch an attack against alien spaceships. One of Landau's favorite episodes, \"The Last Enemy,\" is a Middle East allegory that finds the Alphans literally caught between two perpetually warring planets.Space: 1999's then state-of-the-art special effects hold up well, less so the deliberate pacing.

{"description": "The Dish, a good-natured and effortlessly funny Australian drama-comedy directed by Rob Sitch (The Castle), is filled with warm-hearted characters and has a factual hook that's irresistibly inspiring. This cumulative goodwill springs forth from the rural town of Parkes in New South Wales, where a 1,000-ton radio observatory dish is recruited to relay telemetry, voice, and television signals from the historicApollo 11moon landing in July 1969. To make sure the dish delivers Neil Armstrong's \"giant leap for mankind\" to 600 million eager viewers, site director Cliff Buxton (Sam Neill, at his gentle best) relies on a three-man crew consisting of an American NASA watchdog (Patrick Warburton, resembling a bearish Clark Kent), a sarcastic engineer (Kevin Harrington), and a lovestruck math whiz (Tom Long) who's pining for the sister of the dish's rather dimly overzealous security guard (Taylor Kane).Numerous other supporting characters add color to the proceedings, and crises arise (albeit briefly) when power outage, signal loss, and windstorms threaten to spoil Parkes's proudest hour. It all rates a bit high on the cuteness meter, butThe Dishis so smoothly amusing that you won't object to its eagerness to please. By focusing on the Aussie locals, the film reminds us that the moon landing was an occasion of global unity, and pride in all humanity is reflected in the wondrous smiles of Cliff, his crew, and the citizens of Parkes. That they played such a small but pivotal role in this historical milestone is just one of many joys to be discovered in this delightful little movie.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00001U0DW", "B00005JLD4", "B0006FYOTC", "B000NJL4QC", "0783225733", "B004SIPAJG", "B0007ZEOPK", "B00000K3CS", "B00049QJ9I", "B001CDR1F6", "B00JAQJMJ0", "0767812166", "B004SIP8WU", "B002EAYDUC", "B000294TC4", "B0001DCYUU", "B00005JMYC", "B00BTYJYR6", "B005A1GRSI", "B000MX7V3Y", "B0002V7S34", "B00B4804LM", "B008LFYZAM", "B00H83EUQW", "B0045HCJKS"], "bought_together": ["B00001U0DW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00A33J8YS", "B00001U0DW", "B00BTYJYR6", "B000XJ5TPE"]}, "price": 41.25, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 41306}, "asin": "B00005MKKS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PEGZKY64L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Dish"}
{"description": "LikeCarriebefore it,Ginger Snapsuses horror-movie conventions as an inspired metaphor for puberty. When beautiful but reclusive goth teenager Ginger (Katharine Isabelle) is attacked by a monstrous wolf on the eve of her first period, her body starts changing in a big way, as do her suddenly lusty, feral appetites. Director John Fawcett masterfully balances the expectations of teen horror exploitation (blood, bodies, sex, smart dialogue, and good old-fashioned monster-movie scares) with clever black humor and tender sisterly solidarity. Only devoted sister Brigitte (gloomy Emily Perkins) knows the truth, and even as Ginger's abrupt transformation threatens their once unbreakable friendship, bonds of blood and love keep them together: Brigitte disposes of Ginger's victims while searching for a cure. Mimi Rogers costars as their dotty but unexpectedly sensitive mom, ready to sacrifice all to protect her daughter.

{"description": "Hauntingly beautiful folk music and stunning Appalachian scenery take center stage in this winner of the 2000 Sundance Film Festival Special Jury Prize for outstanding ensemble performance. Musicologist Dr. Lily Penleric has a deep love of English folk ballads. After a humiliating failure to make full professor, she heads off to visit her sister's tiny school in rural Appalachia and finds herself in folk music central. Lily is entranced, but the locals are suspicious of the outlander's motivations. Issues of tolerance, clashing cultures, and Big Bad Men abound, butSongcatcherwisely focuses on the music. Janet McTeer does fine with the \"repressed academic gets in touch with the earth\" role, but her truly outstanding work is in revealing scholar Lily's rapture in her discoveries. McTeer leads a truly great cast, including the wonderful Pat Carroll, and a just-for-the-hell-of-it cameo by bluesman Taj Mahal.Songcatcherhas a healthy respect for the mountain people it portrays, and an absolute reverence for their music.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005B50H", "B000066701", "B000065FJC", "B00404ME1A", "B003UM8T12", "B001VC99HQ", "B0007P0XAA", "B000068TJ4", "B0000A2ZR5", "B00006JTG5", "B000P5FH26", "B003ZFO4XQ", "B000CSWBMK", "B008B9JTFO", "B005OZVXCU", "B004IY6A0S", "B0007TFI1U", "B00004RFAK", "B004SEUJOQ", "B00076YPA8", "0767821432", "B000F4RHBQ", "B001451HVG", "B00004Z4SD", "B0007UDC80", "B00002E20R", "B00G15MDI0", "B0000YTP02", "B00CDWQNMW", "B0009R1TJ0", "B000002N5K", "B000MQC8X4", "B0045HCJRQ", "B0007Q6VY6", "B00005NRN8", "B00005NVHA", "B008LFYZAM", "B00362GK6C", "B00005YUNT", "B004W7D2A2", "B00000ILEC", "B0031Y4A6W", "B0069RWAHY", "B008KJZJE0", "B004SIP6QI", "B0042AGNBE", "B000A2W1X2", "0451202503", "B002VWNIBI", "B000002MJ5", "B00GSBMNOQ", "0813101867", "B0000E1WL4", "B00028G7IO", "B00015HWX2", "B00AEBB8W4", "B00005LOKU", "B00DH5PMV2", "B00IACUOCO", "B00B7U27VW", "B0001US7Q8", "0783226772", "B00013F34Y", "B007CEFTSA", "6305212112", "B003EYVXTG", "0807853682", "B0002ZUIJG", "B001BNFRB2", "B0006IUDC6", "B008FYZHPQ", "B00011Y1QC", "B00DDT0JB0", "B00003CXRM", "B004NTDF5Q", "B00008CMT3", "B000GFRI4K", "B00004TJKJ", "B00AZMFO6I", "B00IU6HPIQ", "B00AKIPAG6", "6305128952", "B00000F3FS", "B00AEFY5GQ", "B008B49EGS", "B00AQ590DM", "B00CDV4NAM", "B0000A2ZO0", "6305428484", "B0095ZIHZ6", "B008GFZWRW", "B004K4FUT8", "B00AN10MK4", "B004SUDQ2W", "B007UW9W5U", "B002L7VFR2", "B001J8R8WK", "B000FTCLR6", "B00003CXB5", "B006FE83UE"], "bought_together": ["B00005B50H", "B000066701"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000065FJC", "B00005B50H", "B000066701", "B008B9JTFO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9244}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.88, "brand": "LIONSGATE FILMS", "asin": "B00005O0SO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YM9XSWEKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Songcatcher"}

Based on Elizabeth Jane Howard's semi-autobiographical novel,The Cazaletsis an engrossing drama that chronicles the end of an era through the trials of one family.It's 1937 and England is filled with rumors of war. Hugh and his father, William, are preparing the Cazalet lumber business for the possibility of a conflict with Germany, but the rest of the clan are preoccupied with their own problems. Rupert is reluctant to give up his art to work with his brothers, and Edward has begun an affair with a married woman, further complicating his already troubled relationship with his own wife and daughter. When war is declared, questions of duty and loyalty become even more important, and three generations of Cazalets have to deal with a host of personal and national challenges and tragedies.Filmed with a wonderful sense of period detail,The Cazaletsevokes a time when long-cherished ideas of class and privilege were crumbling. The large cast is excellent, with exceptional performances from Stephen Dillane and Florence Hoath.The Cazaletscovers a period of more than four years, during which every member of the family is transformed by the war and by their relationships with one another. It's a tribute to this compelling film that even with a running time of six hours it seems to end too soon.--Simon Leake", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 452652}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "title": "Masterpiece Theatre - The Cazalets [VHS]", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B000PFUA7S", "0671527932", "B00006HAZH", "B004JMSIQS", "B003CP1T50"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VRYHXB3QL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "B00005TN87"}
{"description": "Imagine aNational Geographicsurvey of a natural world that hasn't existed for millions of years. The sequel to the mesmerizingWalking with Dinosaurs, one of the most imaginative explorations of the prehistoric world ever made, once again uses the technology of theJurassic Parkfantasies to re-create the \"menagerie of weird and wonderful creatures\" that roamed the globe after the dinosaurs. Designed as a series of survival dramas, each of the six episodes plays like a speculativeDisney True Life Adventure(with appropriately resolute narration by Kenneth Branagh) centered around a day in the life of a creature or the seasonal cycle of a species: a pride of saber tooth cats, a herd of woolly mammoths, a tribe of hominids.

When a troupe of young DJs and promoters decide to turn the house into a nightclub, dark forces are, unsurprisingly, unleashed.Boneshas a cutting sense of humor, and Ernest Dickerson's direction snaps, crackles, and pops. It's not exactly subtle--the opening scene launches into gore and special effects--but there is some evocative imagery, particularly a large black hellhound that the club kids foolishly adopt as a pet. Snoop casts an effectively spectral aura, and Pam Grier, as the hustler's psychically gifted former girlfriend, has her usual presence and energy.

{"description": "Originally broadcast on PBS, the superlativeKurosawais likely to remain the definitive documentary on the life and work of Japanese film master Akira Kurosawa. The film follows the conventional documentary approach of a chronology of Kurosawa's career, with requisite film clips and interviews with many of Kurosawa's surviving collaborators and family members. Western admirers like James Coburn, Clint Eastwood, and Japanese film scholar Donald Richie are also interviewed, and director Adam Low provides a more contemplative appreciation of Kurosawa's life and work. Enhanced by Sam Shepard's straightforward narration and Paul Scofeld's evocative readings from Kurosawa's elusive autobiography, the film functions as both honorable tribute and touching retrospective, especially when the surviving crewmembers ofRashomonare assembled for a 50-year reunion filled with anecdotes and insiders&#x92; perspective. All in all, this is must-see viewing for any lover of film.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00GBT62N8", "B00HE01030", "B0001UZZSG", "0394714393", "B003KGBISY", "B000BR6QCI", "B00180R072", "B000XPSC0C", "0571199828", "B000067IY6", "0847833194", "B00EO2I6W4", "B000AQKUD6", "B00HE010QM", "B003N2CVQ8", "B002AFX52S", "B0000A02TW", "B000VARC3C", "B00005JLEJ", "B008Y5OWO8", "B001BEK8E2", "B00004Y7HL", "B00003CXUM", "B000GTJSYY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BB14YY", "B001BEK8E2", "0394714393", "B000G8NXYG"]}, "price": 16.19, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 277845}, "asin": "B00005YUQ2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516F6ZCC1XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Kurosawa"}

{"description": "Imaginative special effects by the legendary Ray Harryhausen are the  highlights of this adaptation ofJonathan Swift's classic fantasy  novel. Kerwin Mathews, who rose to fame after appearing opposite  Harryhausen's \"Superdynamation\" effects inThe Seventh Voyage of Sinbad(1958), stars as the English Dr. Gulliver, whose travels bring him in contact  with both the diminutive Lilliputians and the gigantic Brobdingnagians. Director Jack Sher's script (with Arthur Ross) tempers Swift's pointed satire in favor of broader humor, and the musical numbers are decidedly unwelcome, but viewers of all ages will be delighted by the film's spirited action and Bernard Herrmann's rousing score. Harryhausen aficionados may be disappointed by the lack of fantastical creatures on display (though a giant  squirrel and alligator are impressive), but his matte work here is nothing short  of spectacular.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001DB6J50", "0767847431", "B00004TJJV", "0767810864", "B00006JDRG", "B008XTVWHK", "B0001BKBFC", "B00018D3ZA", "B00LNBQ8SI", "B00LNBQ8UG", "B000QGEB1W", "B00LMCDHMS", "B00005Y6XR", "B002ZD3V10", "B003HTSJ9A", "B000BMY2KG", "B001AR0D22", "B001DB6J4Q", "B000SAGGL4", "B000Y2Q9J0", "B0001I55XI", "B001D7T69K", "B001DZOCY6", "B0024LIBDQ", "B00007JMD8", "B000B7MX7A", "B0007R4T26", "B00A33J8R0", "B000FOPPEC", "B003L7DK60", "B00D9EJFZA", "B000U5MVXY", "B0045HCJSA", "B000IMVJDW", "B00005R1O8", "1845135571", "B000YDOOHI", "B00005JKU0", "B008SOS5YS", "B0043FQIUE", "B00IYJFB2G", "B000O78KWE", "B00005LKHN", "B00IHCBAQG", "B0007R4T1W", "B00005R1O7", "B005E7SFDI", "B0024FADBK", "B0044O1Q60", "B005R2SJ1I", "B000FVQLKW", "B00B06GF3Y", "B0000B1OGC", "B005ION4U6", "B0000648YD", "B000KGGJ18", "B00IQAUO5C", "B00IQAUO6Q", "B00I3C1T7A", "B00005RERV", "6305761078", "B00D9EJFV4", "B00004TJK0", "B00005JKFR", "B00AEBB8VK", "6305869367", "B0000B1OGE", "B008L0YMVE", "B00J2F6CTC", "B00AEBB94G", "B00I462XF2", "B000CNE09M", "B00I462XNO", "B001D40U7U", "B00IQAUO2A", "B00HENA0MO", "B000EHSVJG", "B00007ELD2", "B00I3C1T6G", "B0024FAG2G", "B00HFWETZ8", "B00005LC4L", "B000VULA94", "B003NNDJRM", "B00I462XLG", "B000UDGOAW", "B00IQAUO48", "6305944288", "B000AYELJ2", "B00094ARW8", "B001ED3JEQ", "B005R2SHIS", "B00FMGPWNW", "1845135016", "B001AR0D40", "B00I462XGG", "B00518A70E", "B00005NSXY", "B00152VXUS", "B0069WB6GA"], "bought_together": ["B001DB6J50", "0767810864"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001DB6J50", "0767810864", "0767847431", "B00004TJJV"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 37753}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.49, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000062XE5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514hIb04CoL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The 3 Worlds of Gulliver"}

Meanwhile, an elite paramilitary squad from North Korea has stolen a shipment of CTX, an undetectable liquid explosive of enormous power, which they've planted all over the city of Seoul. As their investigations are successively foiled, Ryu and Lee begin to suspect that there is a mole within the ranks of the agency--and it may be one of them. Both hyperstylish and hyperrealistic,Shiririps along as a smooth fusion of Hong Kong and American action movies. Ryu's troubled romance with his alcoholic fianc&#xE9;e adds a striking emotional counterpoint to the blazing gunfights and high-speed chases; the ending is unexpectedly moving.

It soon becomes clear that there is something wrong with Aoyama's choice. This is no ordinaryFatal Attraction-style thriller, however;Auditionslowly and carefully builds into a wrenching exploration of both deep male fears and the stereotype of the cute, submissive Japanese woman.Auditionis by no means an easy movie to watch--even hardcore horror fans may have trouble--but it will stay with you for a long, long time.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000CABGW", "B000GSYRY6", "B001MEJY8W", "B0000CC885", "B0009S2T0M", "B000GBEWNY", "B00125WATQ", "B00006FDBW", "B00005JNJR", "B001I82RVS", "B001VG2MAI", "B004P2VQZ2", "B000BGH2A4", "B000ARFPMQ", "B000CRR3ME", "B000GI3RHY", "B002P7UCJK", "B000GB5MOW", "B006L4MWVE", "B00009W0U4", "B003VL3UR0", "B00GGY4R3K", "B005SQRYB4", "B001570H5K", "B000S0GYRU", "B0028DRGDQ", "B000MM0LH8", "B0014VPFVS", "B002EOVXBK", "B000Q7ZKWU", "B0009OUBC4", "B004KDYR20", "B001B187L6", "B006L4MWTQ", "B0000AVHAO", "B000FS9FIA", "B000E0OE4O", "B000E3LGMY", "B00005K9O8", "B000088NQR", "B0007XBM8O", "B0082A3HFK", "B002OVO18A", "B0009KA2UO", "B001D5C1R6", "B000274TLW", "B008G1JIQC", "B000PKG8TW", "B0015ET3YO", "B000JU7JIW", "B000FVQYW2", "B000WC38EQ", "B0007WQHI0", "B004XQO8MS", "B003Y7F1IW", "B002E01MHY", "6305228876", "B000BVM240", "B0016K76V4", "B001JV5BIA", "B000FS9FE4", "B00DW5IM14", "B004H2CXBQ", "B003KGBISE", "B000NA28GG", "B003TRMLQM", "B00BSU0FQA", "B000S0GYRK", "B000FZEQWI", "B000CSTKHE", "B001FOK70S", "B0083H6B0U", "B001MFNB4O", "B000MMLP9G", "B001MYIXAC", "B008CYDD7I", "B000A2XA8M", "B000IMUYJM", "B0007GAG42", "B003UTPL2A", "B00187FPC2", "0783228457", "B000H0M4CK", "B000069I0A", "157362408X", "B004O63TWW", "B004ZKKKW4", "B000H5U5YO", "B000MEYKCI", "B00008WJCJ", "B006U49SC6", "B0009KQOZQ", "B001J710Y8", "B004XQO8LY", "B001G9CNI6", "B00006FMCS", "B00104AYG0", "B00006AUIG", "B000096I9V"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001MEJY8W", "B0000CABGW", "B006L4MWTQ", "B004P2VQZ2"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 202588}, "asin": "B0000640S9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5113YQFBZDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Audition"}

Distraught by the sudden, tragic death of his wife (Debra Messing), John Klein (Richard Gere), a journalist for The Washington Post, finds himself mysteriously drawn to a small West Virginia town when his car inexplicably strands him. Rescued by the sympathetic but skeptical local police sergeant (Laura Linney), he soon learns that many of the town's residents have been beset by bizarre events, including sightings of an eerie \"moth-like\" entity, similar to the one seen by his late wife. Investigating further and having his own terrifying encounters with the creature, he becomes obsessed with the idea that this supernatural being canpredict impending calamities and is trying to warn the town of one. Is this a psychic delusion brought on by his grief or can he convince the police sergeant that there's a tragedy that must be averted", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKZH", "B004BVS2C2", "0765334984", "B00AEBBA2W", "B003102JDC", "B00005JNNT", "B005FUTBSC", "B0002DB54A", "0765341972", "B004SIP92O", "B00ECW9UJY", "B00005JNY3", "B00AEFYC96", "B00L9K2EGS", "B00LBFFR2Y", "B00AEFYYH6", "B0013D8LCC", "6305310335", "B00005JL3T", "0966724674", "6305308837", "B00K2CHW48", "B003DQIPVO", "079074208X", "B000YNFXZA", "B009NZXH5S", "B0001Z52RU", "B00004BZIY", "B00006RCNY", "B00LG6XHDY", "B004B3PBFQ", "B000WMFZN8", "B0006IIKQW", "B0058ZPNUE", "B000TJ6PBK", "B00K2CHWYI", "B000068IEX", "1938398033", "0783240295", "0783116926", "B00BEIYMAG", "B000056T5E", "B00005RHGK", "B00064LJVE", "B005NKIPUY", "B0006HBZXS", "B00K2CHVSK", "B00008EY9G", "B001BRZ5J2", "B00006AUJR", "B000LP6KNU", "B002VWNICC", "6305213305", "6304883773", "B00AEFXW8I", "B0006SGYL0", "B004SIP6WW", "B000V4UFZK", "B000BTJDGC", "B003LR5BD0", "B00151QYOO", "B002AT8KAG", "B0007NFLO0", "0792835727", "B002GHHHN8", "0767817737", "0800177789", "B002O5M4T4", "B00BTYIHS8", "B0045HCJRQ", "B00000JGHL", "B00DZP1C2W", "B00015YVDG", "0792844807", "B00005O5AX", "6305657947", "630542845X", "B002LMSWN2", "B00005UWLB", "B00003L9CQ", "193839819X", "B004LWZW24", "6305718954", "B00BNAE14W", "B00B96TGQS", "0783226888", "B00008L3S6", "6304765258", "B00AEFY4IA", "B003UGLCIA", "B009XTF8KQ", "B004RA7Y9E", "B00AJLHUA8", "B001KMB6X2", "B000KWZ7JC", "B00111YM5Q", "B0050QNO7K", "B000U7169M", "B00AEFYXJ0"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKZH", "B00AEBBA2W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JKZH", "0765341972", "0765334984", "B004SIP92O"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 21120}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.0, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0000648X0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41l8S4jyEIL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Mothman Prophecies"}

Suchet is a perfect Poirot, capturing both his dignity and his humor, and Fraser does a beautiful job of underplaying Hastings enough to keep him the perfect sidekick without ever making him boring.

{"description": "From the moment Vic Perrin's omniscient \"Control Voice\" first proclaimed, \"There is nothing wrong with your television set,\" on September 16, 1963,The Outer Limitswas destined for greatness. The dazzling, long-beloved series was a daring experiment in \"omnibus\" TV, trading the speculative fantasies ofThe Twilight Zonefor farther-out sci-fi concepts. Producers Leslie Stevens and Joseph Stefano had risen as gifted writers from (respectively) Broadway and Hollywood; Stevens rebounded from his previous canceled series, while Stefano had scripted Hitchcock'sPsychoand was eager to expand his creative horizons. With an executive order for scary monsters and cold war thrills, their fruitful symbiosis was preceded by the superb Stevens-directed pilot \"Please Stand By,\" named after the series' once-proposed title and changed to \"The Galaxy Being\" for its broadcast premiere.Cliff Robertson launched an impressive succession of guest stars, and on meager, oft-exceeded budgets of $120,000 per episode,The Outer Limitsbecame a showcase for shoestring ingenuity. The \"blue ribbon crew\" (as Stevens called it) included cinematographer Conrad Hall, whose Oscar&#xAE;-winning skills were honed on the series' cramped TV-studio sets. Packed onto four double-sided DVDs, these 32 episodes (out of a total 49) comprise the series' dynamic first season of moody, frequently paranoid black-and-white adventures.

{"description": "Aside from boasting one of the great evocative titles in film history,S&#xE9;ance on a Wet Afternoon(1964) works up a surplus of dread with a minimum of devices. Kim Stanley was nominated for an Oscar&#xAE;for her performance as a London medium who bulldozes her weak husband (Richard Attenborough) into kidnapping a little girl; the goal is not ransom money, but a chance to prove Stanley's clairvoyant gifts to the police, and thus bring her the respect she has always deserved. The suspense is keen, yet the movie's real achievement is detailing the stifling marriage between two deluded, dependent middle-aged people. Attenborough is heartbreaking as a human doormat, and Stanley's Method intensity brings the movie into a genuinely unnerving realm (she didn't work in movies again for nearly two decades). The story was remade, with intriguing changes, by Japanese director Kiyoshi Kurosawa asS&#xE9;ance(a.k.a.Korei, 2000).--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004X63SI8", "B003B3O5JU", "B008BSM1CI", "B00K6D1R0I", "0823088472", "B0030BOCMS", "B00006RCMX", "B00HRISNPM", "B0009X75EC", "B0048O2YWG", "B00ITZXDDY", "B003156IKW", "B00CVB6XF2", "1453236759", "B00HUTPKA4", "B004RA5AU4", "B00000K0DO", "0780021134", "B0087ZG7OI", "B00005JKGX", "B006X0ZN3K", "B0089LT7ZG", "B00003CXBZ", "B001SMC9L2", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B00005S8KV", "B0033PSH7M", "B00009ZPU3", "B00HZ67OOW", "B00DZP1C8Q", "B000ANVPUG", "B00006LPEO", "B00ESZZOMM", "B0097RU3GI", "B00AEFY9GW", "B00GPPXNLC", "B003ICZW78", "B000VAHQUQ", "B00D9BNONW", "B00A1AU64E", "B00GOT15IM", "B0001WTUE4", "B0009X7678", "B0074JOD2G", "B004X63SCY", "B00027JYLM", "B00A01CQIS", "B00AEFXRWO", "B003XMKMVE", "B000063K2Q", "B000KX0IOU", "B00CUKTHES", "B003D3Y65G", "B00C3ALM02", "B00DZP1BVO", "B001EOQCJE", "B0000AKY54", "B000A0GOEQ", "B00AEBBA7W", "B00009Y3NL", "B001BCUB46", "B00CLIAACC", "B0001US78G", "B0001GH5TW", "B00B27WTBI", "0780022343", "B00A1AU5Y0", "B009X919UE", "B005KQVE1S", "B000035P5E", "B003S5TOZG", "B00AOO5OY4", "B005H8G78O", "B000G6BLY2", "B00AF4OTM6", "B0002KQNJU", "B0003JANSW", "B00CLF821Q", "B00166UFA2", "B0007GAG42", "B000TLTCT0", "B009WHDEQO", "B0007TKNGU", "B001B4VXWS", "B005HOEBW2", "B0035ECHIG", "B0050QNO7K", "B0002HOEQ2", "B0008ENIAC", "B00F98FOI6", "B00AATUZQA", "B0045HCJ94", "B0049985XW", "B000CNESN0", "B00027JYNK", "B000056HEB", "B00D9EJFZA", "B00003CXCF", "B00AEBBA9U", "1892738562"], "bought_together": ["B004X63SI8", "B00006RCMX"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004X63SI8", "B003B3O5JU", "B0045HCJJE", "B004H9X4CG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 189992}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 47.29, "brand": "Image Entertainment", "asin": "B00006FMCR", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41NYNCHX30L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Seance on a Wet Afternoon"}

{"description": "Despite its reputation as an oversimplified epic, King Vidor'sWar and Peaceremains a stellar showcase of Hollywood prestige. While Cecil B. De Mille was reviving ancient Egypt forThe Ten Commandments, Vidor was transforming Italian countryside into war-torn Russia, bringing massive resources to bear on this sumptuous, if ultimately misguided adaptation of Tolstoy's classic. Given the marquee casting of Audrey Hepburn as Natasha and then-husband Mel Ferrer as decorated battle hero Prince Andrei, this is a movie you watch for star value, not literary fidelity (for the latter, look to Sergei Bondarchuk'sRussian version). Henry Fonda serves Tolstoy more effectively as Pierre, whose passive observation of Napoleon's invasion turns this grand moral tale into an intimate study of individual passions. The battle scenes (directed by Mario Soldati) remain impressive, as does the film's grand parade of pomp and circumstance. Slow, regal, and peppered with brilliance, this epic falls short of classic but it's still a visual feast.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000E1MXSW", "B004IK30KA", "B00005ALMH", "B000AP04MO", "B000GI3RMY", "B00005JL6M", "B002TSAAME", "B006TTC5WC", "B002LVF2H2", "B00006JO77", "B000QGE86K", "B0002B15YM", "B00008PX7J", "B00347AIS0", "B00009NHC5", "B003LMPKSQ", "B00AEBB8OC", "5489003219", "B00AMEZDK6", "B00006L92W", "B002HK9IDQ", "B00004STRE", "B00D7AM2QK", "B000MGBLHI", "B00BTYU3ZS", "B00125WAXM", "B0066E6TR2", "0767827775", "B00108FMFO", "B00KIZY3XW", "B0048O1SLO", "0783229488", "B00IJZW4HK", "B0013LPRTE", "B000FFJ83K", "B00D8N92B4", "B000056H2H", "B000H6SXS8", "B0006GANX2", "B002VWNIAY", "B0007PALVQ", "B00008LDO0", "B000062XF0", "B000KJU132", "B00006ADD5", "B000WMFZMY", "B00AEBB97S", "B000GRUQL0", "0671024795", "B00A1AU6ZI", "B0006B2A6U", "B00008LDO1", "B003YW382S", "0783226039", "B00005JN8Z", "B002M2Z3BA", "B00AEFXLKC", "B00006RCO3", "B000E1E2N6", "B00008J2PG", "B0002B15Y2", "B000KJU13C", "B0006B2A7E", "B00J7YV09K", "B00AEFXD1O", "B0045HCJJY", "B0002KPHW4", "B000LC4ZD0", "0425182126", "B0007OY2O4", "B000056AXZ", "B002GSXKQA", "1603200401", "B007XTDW4W", "B00005JMLR", "B000KJU18C", "B00006FDAU", "B00824FK9W", "B0007US7FI", "B00D2CRZ60", "B00AATV07S", "B009D4H08Y", "B007P7UF0G", "B000UYN9OA", "B0001NBMEE", "B000EHQUGC", "B0001NBNGQ", "B00AEFXLBQ", "B00JPQ1IJM", "B0009S4IIS", "B009369YR2", "B009NUHL8M", "B000KJU13M", "B0007PALKC", "B0026KWLAO", "B000WTVZHQ", "B001CDLATY", "B0045HCJS0"], "bought_together": ["B000E1MXSW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000QGE86K", "B006TTC5WC", "B00006JO77", "B002HK9IDQ"]}, "price": 24.85, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 28099}, "asin": "B00006JU7S", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JB5VSA14L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "War and Peace"}

{"description": "A great British crime comedy always worth watching again,Two Way Stretchis about imprisoned crooks who hatch a scheme to pull off a heist with a perfect alibi by breaking out, doing the job, and then breaking back in to serve out their sentences. Peter Sellers, usually an eccentric support in these things, takes a rare lead as cocky mastermind Dodger Lane, confident enough to share the screen with performers who would be doing serious time if scene-stealing were an actual offense. The chief delight of the film is Lionel Jeffries's bristling, infuriated, hilariously humiliated warder Sidney Crout, forever fuming as Dodger gets away with some new scheme. Also in on the scam: Wilfrid Hyde-White as a bogus clergyman, David Lodge as the dimwitted muscleman, and Bernard Cribbins in the nice young man part.

Determined to end their marriage and sever all ties with her past once and for all, Melanie returns to Alabama. But home starts to tug at her heartstrings, and what she thought she wanted may not be what she wants at all.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002K0WBXW", "B00AEFY99O", "B00003CXSM", "B00005O5CM", "B00081U7HC", "B00006ZXSQ", "B0000524E5", "B00005JM55", "B0009OL7Z4", "B00AKGG6JS", "B002ZG988M", "B0045HCJJ4", "B0000897EG", "B00AEBB8NS", "6304765266", "B000YDBPAM", "B00447L4KA", "B000P0J0DS", "B0007PLLBU", "B0015I2RT8", "B00005JG6N", "B0000DIXDR", "B000683VI4", "B004SIP9RO", "B004EPZ0BG", "B002ZG989G", "B00AMEZDJW", "B00006FMUW", "B0038N9X3Q", "B002NZK5V4", "B000MQC9H4", "6302077818", "B000A343RI", "B004SIP9X8", "B002P413IC", "B0000AOV4I", "B001TUZD8O", "B000023VTP", "B0012KJ0DK", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B002VECM6S", "B004SIP8JI", "B00005JN3W", "B00006ZXSL", "B00AEFYQE2", "B003B3V0N4", "B001AEF6BS", "B00386EZKE", "B00004TJKK", "B003NHRIVQ", "B001CTA1UM", "B00AEBB8YW", "B000056VP4", "B00AEFXWXI", "B0021L8V3Y", "B00866JL96", "6305236569", "B003PIUIJC", "B00006ZXSK", "B003Y5H574", "B001LMAK9W", "B002ZG984Q", "B005LAIGSM", "B004EPZ070", "B0036TGSIK", "B00006ZXSO", "B003Y5H524", "B004IK30PA", "B005LAIGXW", "B00AEBB9WI", "B00008G7UF", "B0050MB584", "B001ECDVK4", "B00000JGHK", "B000053VB2", "B00466HN7M", "B0049TC88U", "B00005JPSM", "B008JFUUIA", "B00AEFY5TI", "6305428042", "B00006HAWN", "6305212112", "B005FH1RRI", "B00AEFY4CG", "B0009DWL8W", "B002ZG9968", "B00009WVSL", "B00AEFYM2S", "B000ELJAEM", "B000XJD33O", "B000065V3G", "B000OCZA04", "B005Z9MFRC", "B00164KYV4", "B002GSXKP6", "B00AMSLDWO", "B000EXZFCQ", "B0007IO6NM", "078322740X"], "bought_together": ["B002K0WBXW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004SIP9RO", "6304765266", "B002K0WBXW", "B00AEFY99O"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2055}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.07, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00007E2F5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/413v5KktEdL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sweet Home Alabama"}
{"description": "Dirk Bogarde risked his career to make this 1962 film about a lawyer who risks his career to stand up to blackmailers. Part crime thriller and part plea for tolerance,Victimuses the terror of a blackmailing ring to point out the injustice of Britain's antisodomy laws. Bogarde plays Melville Farr, a married lawyer who learns of a blackmail scheme when one of its victims, an old friend, commits suicide rather than tell the police. As Farr conducts an investigation, he must confront his own past.Victimwas ahead of its time--it was the first English-language movie to use the word \"homosexual\"--and as such it seems quaint and stilted at times. Straw-man clich&#xE9;s about homosexuality must be knocked down, and, like in all first-wave issue movies, occasionally characters need to have rather stilted debates. Still, the crime plot stands on its own, the performances are excellent, and the film is brave enough to make some very good points.

Foremost among American experimental film artists, Brakhage influenced the evolution of the moving image for nearly 50 years (his impact is readily seen on MTV), and this meticulously prepared Criterion Collection anthology represents a virtual goldmine of Brakhage's finest, most challenging work. Challenging because--as observed by Brakhage film scholar Fred Camper in the accompanying booklet--these 26 carefully selected films require the viewer to be fully receptive to \"the act of seeing with one's own eyes\" (to quote the title of one film, consisting entirely of autopsy footage), which is to say, open to the perceptual and psychological responses that are provoked by Brakhage's non-narrative shorts, ranging here from ninesecondsto 31 minutes in length. While \"Dog Star Man\" (1961-64) is regarded as Brakhage's masterpiece, what emerges from this superb collection is the creative coherence of Brakhage's total vision.

{"description": "Matrixwriter-directors Larry and Andy Wachowski commissioned seven  artists from Japan, America and Korea to make nine short films set in the  world of theirfeature trilogy. Some of the top anime directors contributed  to this anthology, including Yoshiaki Kawajiri (Ninja Scroll), Koji  Morimoto (Robot Carnival), and  Shinchiro Watanabe (Cowboy  Bebop). Some of the films tie directly into the narrative of the live-action movies. Drawn in a style reminiscent of Jean \"Moebius\" Giraud, Mahiro  Maeda'sThe Second Renaissance(Part I & Part II) depicts the  human-machine wars that caused the enslavement of humanity and the creation  of the Matrix. The duel between two flamboyantly costumed Kabuki warriors in  Kawajiri'sProgramis an expanded version of the cybernetic training  Neo (Keanu Reeves) undergoes in the firstMatrixfilm. Watanabe evokes  the look of old newspaper photographs inA Detective Story,which  falls outside the storyline of the features. Fast-paced, violent and grim,The Animatrixis an uneven but intriguing compilation that represents  a new level in the ongoing cross-pollination between Japanese animation and  American live action.

{"description": "The eighth season ofThe X-Fileswill always be remembered as the year of brave decisions. David Duchovny's increasing dissatisfaction with the role meant he'd only appear in a few episodes. The solution? Enter Agent John Doggett (Robert Patrick) who basically stole the show within his first two minutes of screen time (and watch out for severalTerminator 2in-jokes too!). Scully (Gillian Anderson) switched roles to being the believer alongside Doggett's skeptic in a year that was more reliant on the background story arc than ever before. Her pregnancy remained at the foreground, while a more prominent Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) joined in a hunt for the abducted Mulder that drew upon the black oil, cloning, and bounty-hunting aspects of the convoluted alien conspiracy story. A distinct lack of guest stars or writers indicated maturity beyond the need for ratings stunts: dedicated fans were pleased to see sinister Krycek, the reliable Lone Gunmen, and the return of the show's very first abductee. The real strengths of the season came from new characters, including alternative female role model Special Agent Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and some terrific standalone episodes. Investigations covered a man going backward in time, deaths aboard an oil rig, a contagion in the Boston subway tunnels, and creatures resembling bats and slugs. Agent Leyla Harrison (named after anX-Filesfan who died of cancer) got to ask all the petty questions regular viewers want to know themselves. With season 9 promised to be the last, this year was a remarkable achievement so late in a show's life.--Paul Tonks", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EXDS3Y", "B000EXDS34", "B000CNE0TC", "B000CNE0T2", "B000CNE0SS", "B000BOH990", "B000BOH98G", "B000BOH986", "B0007X7044", "B001FACH7S", "B001G7PSZI", "B0006UEVUE", "B001G7PT4I", "B001CY5N00", "B003V1IU3O", "B001G7PSSK", "B000244E2O", "B001G0MFIS", "B00KC57IWG", "B00465I156", "B0009X76XW", "B001CQONKY", "B00FXW9664", "B000UX6TIE", "B000SULWKO", "B001MVWRNE", "B003FSTN5M", "B0002CX1M0", "B00IWTVDUW", "B00GTZWZH6", "B006LG74RE", "B004X60QE2", "B000063V8R", "B00064VQXA", "1613777515", "1933784725", "B009LDD5XQ", "B000CQM4YM", "B0070DERD6", "B00129W6LE", "B0007UDCX0", "B001HUHBBS", "B000F8O2PG", "B00DYQ1GBE", "B001MVWRMU", "B00005Y1NF", "B005CFC04W", "B0036EH3X4", "B0019N95IK", "B00AGKHBZ6", "B000FGGE7C", "B00133QNSG", "B00005JM3A", "B002BWP2IK", "B000H7JCGY", "B001MVWRN4", "B003L77GWE", "B000AQ68X2", "B006TBYC76", "B001DXS4DI", "B00008972G", "1613777183", "6305767866", "B000B8I9ZO", "B000002N8O", "B00CHZ236K", "B0009NZ2RE", "B001C4CI8U", "B00022FWEU", "B000P0J0BU", "B000A88EU0", "B000W4KT9G", "B007STBUHI", "1613779445", "0783225725", "B00GX7D5JW", "B0009X7646", "B001AQR39O", "B000H1RFXM", "B00J5JSV1W", "B000B8IA08", "B008LCRABQ", "B000Q6GUW0", "B0057FGD3Q", "B003YF9Q08", "B00IQ8TT82", "B000O77SMW", "B000FBH3WM", "B000NDEXKW", "B009NH6AOQ", "6303961614", "B005FISBTO", "B008LCRAC0", "B000NOIX66", "B001L5SRJE", "B00J2R3W52", "B0002NY8GW", "B003R0MEZO", "B00BM2JVAA", "B00BTYPW7C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000CNE0TC", "B000CNE0SS", "B000BOH990", "B000CNE0T2"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 72854}, "asin": "B00008YGRY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N2NNAHHBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The X-Files - The Complete Eighth Season"}

{"description": "Though it bears little resemblance to the original 1969 thriller starring Michael Caine, the 2003 remake ofThe Italian Jobstands on its own as a caper comedy that's well above average. The title's a misnomer--this time it's actually a Los Angeles job--but the action's just as exciting as it propels a breezy tale of honor and dishonor among competing thieves. Inheriting Caine's role as ace heist-planner Charlie Croker, Mark Wahlberg plays straight-man to a well-cast team of accomplices, including Mos Def, Jason Statham, and scene-stealer Seth Green in a variation of the role originally played by Noel Coward.

{"description": "For earthbound humans,Winged Migrationis as close as any of us will get to sharing the sky with our fine feathered friends. It's as if French director Jacques Perrin and his international crew of dedicated filmmakers had been given a full-access pass by Mother Nature herself, with the complete \"cooperation\" of countless species of migrating birds, all answering to eons of migratory instinct. The film is utterly simple in purpose, with minimal narration and on-screen titles to identify the wondrous varieties of flying wildlife, but its visceral effect is humbling, awesome and magnificently profound. Technically, Perrin surpasses the achievement of his earlier filmMicrocosmos(which did for insects what this film does for birds), and apart from a few digital skyscapes for poetic effect, this astonishing film uses no special effects whatsoever, with soaring, seemingly miraculous camera work that blesses the viewer with, quite literally, a bird's-eye view.

{"description": "This low-key, thoroughly delightful comedy is the product of Scottish comic/actor/writer/director Craig Ferguson's goofy and sweet imagination. Ferguson plays retired rock star Paul Kerr, a 1980s sensation whose whiskey-fueled antics in a Welsh mansion land him, involuntarily, in a psychiatric hospital. In short order, an old bandmate (Ralph Brown) turns up to help Paul get sober, and a long-lost love (Jemma Redgrave) introduces the mortified musician to an adolescent daughter (Charlotte Church) he never knew he had. Lots of catching up and relationship repairs ensue, but the film is really an off-center, eccentric comedy in which quaint villagers debate the origins of guitar feedback and 75-year-old veteran actor Joss Ackland (Surviving Picasso) can be found performing Roy Orbison rockers. A pleasant surprise is golden-throated Church's acting debut; revered for years as a singing prodigy, she proves to be a natural actress and outstanding pop-song stylist.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790748460", "B00003CXMY", "B000063K0J", "B005FHHD58", "B00CQRNLLU", "B001NFNFIU", "B000Z27HFE", "B0040JHF32", "B001053024", "B00007CVRM", "B00FBQ38VQ", "B00005Y6XP", "1573301469", "B0009U5DCQ", "0811853756", "B00005AUGM", "0061998494", "B00004ZDPO", "B00000I9CF", "B00002EPP9", "0811858197", "B000053VAE", "B0041QSZGU", "B004IY6AS0", "0061719544", "B000CSRSGY", "B0019BI19Q", "B000002PEY", "B007K7IBTI", "B0060RU2QO", "B00472O3C8", "B0007VCUGO", "B00FPPQYXM", "B00005NFY6", "B002I5GNZQ", "0752893394", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B0009PBLU4", "B00BTYU3QW", "B000G0F13K", "6305588236", "B00000ILEC", "B00008DDVT", "B002WY65UQ", "B008R3EYWM", "B0026RX2VE", "B00007GZZW", "B00005JLJC", "B002GOAH1U", "B0009OJ9R2", "B003OOH444", "B00AZMFO6I"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXMY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CXMY", "B00000I9CF", "0790748460", "B005MWPW86"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 47897}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.79, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0000TG492", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51538Xcdj5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "I'll Be There"}

{"description": "Ridley Scott'sGladiatoris a great movie, butColosseum: A Gladiator's Storyhas the distinct advantage of purely historical accuracy. The Roman gladiator whose story is told here is Verus (played by charismatic British hunk Robert Shannon), one of two victors in the only gladiatorial battle that was ever described in detail (by the Roman poet Martial in 80 A.D.). Using this factual record as its basis,Colosseumfollows Verus as he is recruited from slavery, trained in gladiator's school, rises to favor among wealthy Romans, and ultimately battles his best friend, Priscus (Derek Lea), to a crowd-pleasing draw in the inaugural games of glorious, brand-new Colosseum, the construction of which is shown in fascinating detail. Combining authoritative narration with diary-like voiceovers from Verus's perspective, this riveting 50-minute BBC production is simultaneously intimate and epic in scale, employing the latest in digital compositing techniques to achieve its unparalleled (for TV, at least) visual splendor. With well-cast actors speaking authentic Latin, this sumptuous production is both dramatically involving and exacting in every detail.Just as convincing--and just as impressive in its use of cutting-edge CGI--is the 50-minute bonus programPompeii: The Final Day, which chronicles the final 24 hours of Pompeii when it was decimated by the ultraviolent eruption of Mount Vesuvius on August 24, 79 A.D. Inspired by the written descriptions of Pliny the Younger (whose detailed observations were later vindicated by geological science), recovered artifacts, and the haunting remains of Pompeii citizens preserved under tons of pumice and ash,Pompeiiis first-rate from start to finish, proving yet again that the BBC is now setting the standard in lavishly produced docudrama programming.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00GMV8GL6", "B005ELVCPW", "B00GUEROFO", "B003EYVXXW", "B000AJJNLI", "B000BKVL9I", "B000VKL6ZM", "B004FN25IS", "B000B7MX70", "B00007AJF4", "B00406UK7S", "B000PFUA78", "B0006D3HDI", "B00005JMH8", "B00005R23V", "B00J11U54K", "B000A6T1ZE", "B0034G4P58", "B004X1Z14C", "B0002PYTB4", "B00125WAXM", "B00009MEEN", "B007K7IB9I", "B00000JYWU", "B000A1OFZ0", "B004G9UXB2", "B000EOTEK4", "B0057FGD2C", "B004P2VQZC", "B001DZOCY6", "B002C6VMIY", "B003X2P976", "B0002S93TO", "B00BEJL6JK", "B00005MKKE", "B004H0M31I", "B000FC2HKO", "B000OIOPPE", "B002NN7ETC", "B0006GANX2", "B000F6ZCHA", "B0037JO0X4", "B000S0KYTE", "B000GIXEIG", "B0002VEU4O", "B001F34HT6", "B00LG7VVPO", "B00005JN8Z", "B003DVNUUK", "B001PCNZEU", "B000NO2416", "B000F9SUT4", "B00HRUQ9QK", "B004B93RDS", "0618473084", "0199171580", "B000MGB6NM", "B00J11U4T6", "B00A3THVKK", "B001FZQOOU", "B0007OCG5Q", "B000051WAH", "B000H0M3YY", "B00IJZW4HK", "B00BBNDQCO", "B001AD8FXK", "B000XXWKBQ", "B000BB1520", "B0002YLCG0", "B00004Z4TL", "B000CSTK7O", "B003X2P97G", "B001KL3H1W", "B000HWZ4AC", "B00H3N3UV8", "B0041KT3P8", "B006JY3OHW", "B001FZQOPO", "B002M3JJEG", "B00DL48BM6", "B00005NB94", "B000EMG99U", "B00I01FVQO", "B00AGKHF1G", "B001OLP2TI", "B00HT851LO", "B0074JOUHE", "B006C1S1DY", "B005OTGS4E", "B001EAWMGA", "B000JJSJ96", "0783226039", "B0041SI78O", "B0023BZ64Y", "B0009IW8KS", "B00CHMBQM0", "B00JBGSHSQ", "B000YDMPBU", "B00IWTVDUW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00GMV8GL6", "B00GUEROFO", "B00J11U54K", "B00406UK7S"]}, "price": 6.56, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 282717}, "asin": "B00017LVKA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SPAEX12ML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Colosseum - A Gladiator's Story/Pompeii - The Last Day"}

{"description": "Cue the Henry Mancini music and watch out for Cato--the gist of thePink Pantherseries has been gathered in a six-disc boxed set. At the center of it is Peter Sellers's incarnation of inspector Jacques Clouseau, a hopelessly bumbling detective with a genius for resting his hands in the wrong place (on the surface of a spinning globe, for instance) and mangling the English language.Writer-director Blake Edwards cast Peter Ustinov as Clouseau inThe Pink Panther, but Ustinov dropped out just before shooting began. Edwards (who recounts this story in a spotty commentary track included here) and Sellers bonded over their affection for Laurel and Hardy, and immediately transformed the character of Clouseau into a walking sight gag. The first film has a delicious swinging sixties vibe, while jewel thief David Niven, Claudia Cardinale, and Capucine occupy as much screen time as Sellers. Sellers really hits his stride inA Shot in the Dark, an elegantly funny tale of Clouseau sleuthing out a murder investigation. This one introduced Herbert Lom, as the increasingly frazzled Inspector Dreyfus, and Burt Kwouk, as Clouseau's houseboy-nemesis Cato. Sellers and Edwards, whose relationship was stormy, put Clouseau aside for over 10 years, until a trilogy of mid-1970s comedies restored the character to commercial (and dare we say cultural) primacy.Unfortunately, the very funny comeback picture,Return of the Pink Panther, is absent from this set due to rights issues with the studios involved.The Pink Panther Strikes Againhas Dreyfus going bananas and targeting Clouseau;Revenge of the Pink Pantherputs Clouseau in a hilarious series of disguises, climaxing in a wonderfully mounted sequence in Hong Kong. (Throughout the series, the calm, classical staging of gags by Blake Edwards reminds you of what a lost art this has become.)Trail of the Pink Pantherlooks better now than it did when originally released in 1982, shortly after Sellers's death; it's a batch of unused Sellers routines from previous pictures, strung together with a loose plot. In other words, it's a \"deleted scenes\" extra, and quite funny at times.Subsequent effortsCurse of the Pink PantherandSon of the Pink Pantherare neither included nor mentioned. A half-hour documentary gives pleasant memories from Edwards, but feels incomplete. The cartoon Panther gets his own 11-minute mini-doc, plus six cartoon shorts including the Oscar-winning \"The Pink Phink.\"--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009IW8OE", "B001IHJ988", "B001LXIDUY", "B0009S4J2I", "B001HUWQGS", "B00260HH1M", "B0009S4J4G", "B00005JKH9", "B003NTUOGU", "B000055Y0X", "B000FBH3V8", "B00009MEKJ", "B000CCBCDK", "B00005RDRO", "B0001Y9YJ8", "B00005JL0I", "B0016LFG5Q", "B001LXIDUO", "B0007R4SX6", "B000MQ54M6", "B000CEXFBK", "B001NPD9R2", "B000MEYKC8", "B0009S4J3C", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B000CNFC4E", "B000NDEXPM", "B0009S4J32", "B002TSAAME", "B0001F0WM0", "B000CEXFC4", "B000056NN6", "B00008438W", "B001IHJ974", "B0009S4J50", "B0009S4J4Q", "B0007ZEOCS", "B0009S4J2S", "B00014NEX0", "B0006IIPK8", "B0007XBKP4", "B00K2CHVSK", "B0000AUHPB", "B002HK9IDQ", "B00AEBB97S", "B0000CBY1C", "B0089TQ7AG", "B0007TKNM4", "B003DUBAX0", "B002HR456E", "B000G6BLWE", "B00005NSXY", "B001PK47H6", "B0058O1FES", "B00016MSV2", "B00132D7XQ", "B00000CQJZ", "B000G26YAW", "B000FO0A9W", "B00871C09S", "B000RPCK1U", "6305308748", "B00AEFYVUQ", "B008M4C1BC", "B005NFJAQC", "B0082LUGPI", "B00006ADD5", "B000244EWO", "B00AEFXDO6", "B0014BQQYS", "B002VWNIAY", "B00006JU7S", "B007N31YH0", "B003ZEQMH8", "B00009IB1F", "B001666484", "B00E8AVN9U", "B00005V5NS", "B00AEBBA9U", "B00000I5Y6", "B00066FBQG", "B001KZOVJK", "B00K7IPGS6", "B003UN2I4K", "B0009RCPY8", "076780676X", "B001RTKKNA", "B0009UZG3C", "B000P296AS", "B000E6ESI0", "B000FFJYAM", "B0000AGWJ3"], "bought_together": ["B0009IW8OE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0009IW8OE", "B0009S4J3C", "B000CEXFC4", "6305308748"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 24047}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 70.95, "brand": "MGM", "asin": "B0001AG01M", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/416EFSMVDPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Pink Panther Film Collection (The Pink Panther / A Shot in the Dark / Strikes Again / Revenge of / Trail of the Pink Panther)"}

{"description": "This two-disc set certainly improves upon the fluffyReloadedDVD release. Although there's still no Wachowski brothers talking about their creation, there's a lot of good stuff here in the three main segments. We are constantly reminded how long the back-to-back filming schedule was, and it's most interesting to hear from the actors and artists as they come to the end of this long road. When a white rabbit flashes on screen, you can \"branch\" the most interesting documentary footage: how \"bullet time\" is being recalibrated and how you go about replicating so many Agent Smiths. A timeline is wonderfully put together, but cumbersome to navigate through. The extras certainly illustrate how the movie did not deserve to be passed over for a few technical Oscar nominations.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000AXE8I", "B000P0J0AQ", "B00008LDPU", "B001TK80C0", "B00005N5S5", "B001VLBDD0", "B000AYELVA", "B004LWZW42", "B004LWZWGA", "B001FB55HQ", "B001HN697M", "B000EGDB10", "B0002J4X1Q", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00005JN0T", "B00005JNJV", "B003Y5H5EW", "B001GKJ2E8", "B005LAIHXQ", "B000UR9T8C", "B000VWYJ86", "B009MO57H6", "B00005JMEW", "B00005JMUA", "B00003CWT6", "B001DHXT20", "B00005JKZV", "B00005JKCH", "B000HCO83Q", "B000U7WV1Y", "B000099635", "B0000VAFO0", "B000HRMAPE", "B001DJLD1M", "B008JFUS0U", "B000VR0570", "B005LAIGW8", "B001GZ6QC4", "B005G4TJUC", "B000QXDED6", "B000P0J06K", "B0087ZG7NO", "B00005JLXH", "B004LWZWFQ", "B00003CXTA", "B00IKM5LXG", "B00005JKWJ", "B002ZG98UA", "B0002KVUKM", "B00004STUL", "0780624890", "B00011CZRE", "B004SIP95G", "B00005JKZY", "B00005JA8B", "B00E5I2M6I", "B0090SI56Y", "B0009MDPYM", "B008JFUPFI", "B00005JNTU", "B002IPFWTE", "B000P0J06U", "B001F7MSFM", "B000AYELVU", "B007K3JFUQ", "B00005JMQW", "B0049IHX2C", "B0007P0XBO", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B0085A9HU6", "B00AEFY5B6", "B008JFUO72", "B00006HBUJ", "B001AK3S4Y", "B000P0J0EW", "B0007V6ITE", "0767834739", "B00005JLWN", "B0000VCZK2", "B00FEHCQEC", "B0014Z4ON4", "B001UV4XHY", "B002GSXKNI", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00070FX5U", "B00177YA1K", "B00005JKIP", "B003QO8TOQ", "B000U1ZV8K", "B002ZG980U", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0045HCJGC", "B00000JQB5", "B00005JL78", "B004EPYZUS", "B002ZG99QS", "B000AP04FG", "B000HEVZ9E", "B000OVLBF8"], "bought_together": ["B0000AXE8I", "B000P0J0AQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001DJLD1M", "B000P0J0AQ", "B0000AXE8I", "B001BRJZPW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 123737}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "Matrix", "asin": "B0001BKAEE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5149DT5Y2CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Matrix Revolutions (Two-Disc Full Screen Edition) [DVD]"}

{"description": "Hayao Miyazaki gained widespread attention in Japan for his complex ecological manga series,Nausica&#xE4; of the Valley of the Wind(1982), which he adapted for the screen two years later. One thousand years after a war devastated much of the Earth, humanity clings to existence at the fringes of a vast, polluted forest inhabited by monstrous insects. Only Nausica&#xE4;, the princess of the tiny realm of the Valley of the Wind, grasps the environmental significance of the forest. She sees beyond petty wars and national rivalries to the only viable future for the planet. InNausica&#xE4;, Miyazaki began to explore elements he would develop more fully in his later films: daring, compassionate heroines; exciting flying sequences; colorful side characters; strong interpersonal relationships; and a call for an ecologically sustainable way of life. Nausica&#xE4; prefigures Sheeta inCastle in the Skyand Chihiro inSpirited Away, just as the rough and ready Asbel anticipates Pazu inCastle in the Skyand Ashitaka inPrincess Mononoke. For years,Nausica&#xE4;was available in the United States only as the badly re-editedWarriors of the Wind. The new English dub from Disney presents the film in its entirety, with strong vocal performances by Uma Thurman, Patrick Stewart, Alison Lohman, and Edward James Olmos.

{"description": "Millenniummarked the second major television series created by Chris Carter, who'd already made his name as the brains behindThe X-Files. And, like its predecessor, it shares a lot of the same themes--it's a crime thriller that gradually unfolds into a grand conspiracy involving the government and the fate of the entire world.Agent Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) is a former FBI agent who has transplanted his family from Washington, D.C. to Seattle, after suffering something of a breakdown. He's an expert criminal profiler--arguably the best, thanks to his ability to \"see\" into the minds of killers--and he fears for the safety of his wife and young daughter. In Seattle, he joins the mysterious Millennium Group, an agency of freelance crime-busters who investigate particularly brutal crimes. As a result,Millenniumis downright bleak viewing, as Black jumps from horrific slaying to horrific slaying. Moreover, there's a growing sense of unease about the workings of the Millennium Group, so that in typical Chris Carter fashion, you don't know who to trust. With its pre-Y2K angst and overwhelming darkness, as well as its general humorlessness,Millenniumhasn't dated as well asThe X-Files. Still, thanks to Carter's vision and Henriksen's compelling take on the tortured Black, it's difficult not to get hooked.--Ted Kord", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000667HBS", "B0009X76XW", "B0006UEVUE", "B000EXDS3E", "B000EXDS3Y", "B000BOH98G", "B000BOH986", "B000BOH990", "B000CNE0T2", "B000CNE0SS", "B000EXDS34", "B000CNE0TC", "B0007X7044", "B001FACH7S", "B000O77SMW", "B000FOPPBA", "B000ATQYXI", "1480277460", "B000AM6OQ2", "B0000AOX0A", "B001G7PSZI", "B00028HOMM", "B00JQYV0B4", "B0056GLNQI", "B00E0KWBAI", "B001MVWRMU", "B0081QF6Q8", "B005HMHPE0", "B0001O3YD0", "B0015ET3YO", "0060575913", "0143039911", "B004X60QE2", "B0006UEVTK", "B00022FWEU", "B0013DZNAA", "B00HUPC5X8", "B00005JM67", "B000BCCAEQ", "B000056BP1", "B00E5S2HGS", "0060083972", "B00FUABG1C", "B004YPED14", "B001MVWRN4", "B001RHGRTS", "B00BTFK01Y", "B00B5ARKC0", "6304698763", "0141182342", "B0009NZ2RE", "B0013ZGN9I", "B00062IDEW", "B001CY5N00", "B0000694XX", "B0007N1AM2", "B001MVWRNE", "B000N3T0EG", "B00004YC1W", "B000FJH5M2", "B000HT3P60", "B000EOTTS6", "B001MVWRNO", "B00008NV4G", "B0000AOX09", "B0053O8A46", "B00A8KJN8M", "B005S9EJ8W", "B000B5XOVQ", "B003UD7J26", "B001AZIRZO", "B005LAIHXQ", "B0002V7OI8", "B0009W5J4Q", "B0055SNHQG", "B002AS464Q", "B001715A92", "B0051GOB2G", "B000MV8ABS", "B00AATGDUC"], "bought_together": ["B000667HBS", "B0009X76XW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001CY5N00", "B0006UEVUE", "B000667HBS", "B001FACH7S"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 75357}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 20.65, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B000244E2O", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VH96EF60L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Millennium - The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "In 1966,Star Trekset out to boldly go where no series had gone before, beginning a three-year mission that led to afranchisethat would last decades.  Here at last is the first season of the original series all in one box, 29 episodes in their original broadcast order.  That means starting with \"The Man Trap,\" and soon followed by \"Where No Man Has Gone Before,\" the second pilot filmed and the first one starring William Shatner as Captain Kirk.  The many highlight episodes include \"Balance of Terror\" and \"Errand of Mercy\" (introducing, respectively, the Romulans and the Klingons), the two-part \"The Menagerie\" (which recycled footage from the original pilot, \"The Cage,\" which featured Christopher Pike as the captain of theEnterpriseand is not included in this set), \"Space Seed\" (introducing Ricardo Montalban's Khan character), and \"The City of the Edge of Forever\" (written by sci-fi giant Harlan Ellison and considered by many the best-ever episode of the series).The first-season DVD set is supplemented by 80 minutes of featurettes incorporating 2003-04 interviews with Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, other cast members, and producers, and some 1988 footage of Gene Roddenberry.  The longest (24 minutes) featurette, \"The Birth of a Timeless Legacy,\" examines the two pilot episodes and the development of the crew.  Slightly shorter are \"To Boldly Go... Season One,\" which highlights key episodes, and \"Sci-Fi Visionaries,\" which discusses the series' great science fiction writers (most famously in \"The City of the Edge of Forever\").  Shatner shows off his love of horses in \"Life BeyondTrek,\" and, more interestingly, Nimoy debunks various rumors in \"Reflections of Spock.\"  As they've done for many of thefeature-film special editions, Michael Okuda and Denise Okuda provide a pop-up text commentary on four of the episodes filled with history, trivia, and dry wit.  It's the first commentary of any kind for aStar TrekTV show, but an audio commentary is still overdue.  The technical specs are mostly the same as otherTrekTV series--Dolby 5.1, English subtitles--but with the welcome addition of the episode trailers.  The plastic case is an attempt to replicate some of the fun packaging of the series' European DVD releases, but it's a bit clunky, and the paper sleeve around the disc case seems awkward and crude.  Still, the set is a vast improvement both in terms of shelf space and bonus features compared to the oldtwo-episode discs, which were released before full-season boxed sets became the model for television DVDs.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0017VG69U", "B001DHXT3Y", "B0002JJBZO", "B000HEWEJ4", "B002I9Z8I0", "B00DSCAH5K", "B00005Y1NF", "B0007TKH66", "B00BHWG1AI", "B002I9Z8GM", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00BI3XZA0", "B000127LW2", "B000AOEMXC", "B002I9Z8AS", "B000063V8T", "B000062XFG", "B0009I7NGW", "B000063V8R", "B0002IQKAY", "B002HWRYJE", "B00BHWG0DQ", "B0000AUHOH", "B000063V8S", "B000QGEB1W", "B00005JKHP", "B00BHWG0G8", "B0000DC3VM", "B00004Y87O", "6305181721", "0810991721", "B008YO6B1Q", "B0001NBNFW", "B00JJRLFTU", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B00IF0KASY", "B0006UEVTA", "B00096S47G", "B0002JP4GE", "B0006IUDXA", "B000085RK5", "B00HZMZ286", "B00008KGT0", "1451621299", "B000BOH986", "B0045HCJKS", "B0028S1100", "B00008972H", "B00005JKFR", "6305972001", "B00062IDLA", "B0002WZTCA", "B00005JLF5", "B000O78KWE", "B00125WAYG", "B006VRRGNK", "B001MT7ZI8", "B001DMVZJ4", "B000063UR1", "B0044XV7AQ", "B00008KA5A", "B00008KA57", "B001DZOC78", "B0002XVQNK", "B005BYBZQ8", "B00008KA58", "B008412UQ4", "B00BHWG0CM", "B000B8QG3G", "B002I9Z8BM", "B004L9GMBC", "B0011FLGZQ", "B000RZIGVS", "B000AOEMXM", "B000FOQ03C", "B000VECAD0", "B00GX7D5G0", "B00F3L8P26", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B000UZDO62", "B000QUUD56", "B0057RCFQS", "B00158K0V0", "B001DJLD1C", "B000E6ESEY", "B000067FPC", "6305081034", "B003NH3X5Q", "B002VA59ZS", "B0000524D0", "B00062RCC6", "B00K7IPFSM", "B005SJGI8Q", "B00GOC74YI", "B000VS6R3A", "0792838408", "B00008YLVB", "B00008KA59", "B002JVWRD6", "B00HQLZCIQ"], "bought_together": ["B0017VG69U", "B001DHXT3Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001DHXT6G", "B0017VG69U", "B001DHXT3Y", "B002I9Z8I0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 112743}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 45.25, "brand": "Paramount Pictures", "asin": "B0002I831S", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-i94ujdjL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "Launched during the neon-lit 1980s,The Golden Girlsshed light on a side of Miami ignored byMiami Vice. In other words, no drugs, no murder--just four women of \"a certain age,\" spending their golden years in the sun. Like the theme, \"Thank You for Being a Friend,\" the long-running sitcom was about friendship (not crime). As for the \"girls,\" they were tart-tongued Dorothy (Beatrice Arthur), former farm girl Rose (Betty White), Southern belle Blanche (Rue McClanahan), and Dorothy's salty Sicilian mother Sophia (Estelle Getty). All were widows, with the exception of the divorced Dorothy.  Created by Emmy-winning producer Susan Harris (Soap),The Golden Girlsre-ignited the careers of 1970s TV veterans Arthur (All in the Family,Maude) and White (The Mary Tyler Moore Show). At the same time, it made stars of McClanahan (who co-starred onMaude), by playing a comic version ofA Streetcar Named Desire's Blanche Dubois, and the scene-stealing Getty, made to look older than her actual age (she and Arthur were born the same year).Notable guests to lend their talents to the first season includeStar Trek: Voyager's Robert Picardo (\"The Operation\"),Alice's Polly Holliday (\"Blind Ambitions\"), andWKRP in Cincinnati's Gordon Jump (\"Big Daddy\"). In addition, Harold Gould (Rhoda), who appears in \"Rose the Prude,\" would return as a (different) recurring character five years later.The Golden Girlsran for seven seasons and spawned spin-offThe Golden Palace(without Arthur) and a British version calledThe Brighton Belles.

{"description": "The eighth season ofFriendspicks up just moments after Monica and Chandler said, \"I do.\" But the focus of this season is firmly on Rachel's pregnancy, as the story progresses from fatherhood revelations in \"The One with the Red Sweater\" and \"The One Where Rachel Tells...\" toward complicated new feelings for Rachel, Ross, and Joey, culminating in the maternity ward two-parter \"The One Where Rachel Has a Baby.\"  But it's not all Rachel's pregnancy story. Standalone highlights include \"The One with the Rumor\" in which the \"We Hate Rachel\" club started in high school by Ross and a certain Mr. Jennifer Aniston (an uncredited Brad Pitt) is revealed; while \"The One with Monica's Boots\" has Monica and Chandler arguing over finances when Phoebe and Ross are arguing over the attentions of Sting's wife, Trudie Styler (cameoing as herself). Relationship complications fall upon Phoebe as \"The One with the Tea Leaves\" hooks her up with a stellar cameo from Alec Baldwin. \"The One with Joey's Interview\" has Matt LeBlanc in top form preparing to be interviewed bySoap Opera Digest. But time starts to tick faster for everyone in \"The One Where Rachel Is Late,\" as Joey's WWI movie finally arrives, but is overshadowed by the wait for Rachel's overdue arrival. Naturally it's all build-up to the cliffhanger finale and a final emotional surprise.--Paul Tonks", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006ZM8M2", "B0001AW066", "B003TNW030", "B003TNW03A", "B0000C2IXN", "B003TNW04Y", "B0000844MI", "B000068CNX", "B005IA9JSG", "B003TNW02G", "B005MG8UNG", "B00020HAWY", "B005IA9JRM", "B005IA9JQ8", "B005IA9JVI", "B001BJARX4", "B000HT3P7E", "B00B1LKXPY", "B0019CSXAM", "B000TM1CKQ", "B0024FAR6Q", "B000NOKFH6", "B0009WFEEG", "B0001907BW", "B005SJGIV8", "B000GPIPTM", "B008LCRA98", "B00005JLEX", "B008LCRABQ", "B000SINT4S", "B000EHSVLE", "B0002I84FS", "B003UD7JAI", "B000AJJNI6", "B002N5N4FS", "B000NNK4DW", "B000EBGFPY", "B008L0YMZA", "B00005JNEQ", "B000GRUMQY", "B000VZADPQ", "B000A7PKGW", "B00BUWD7Y8", "B008LCRAC0", "B000QFCDAO", "B00B04NII6", "B003L77G6U", "B00005JN0Z", "B000640WGM", "B000IJ79VG", "B0007R4SWC", "B000T22PVG", "B003SNJY1C", "B001BNFR6M", "B000GETTKM", "B005D0OHA6", "B00A1AU72A", "B000LV6O12", "B0044LYRFA", "B000Q6GUW0", "B000ERVK5S", "B0006Q93AQ", "B007C8RZL0", "B005IA9JQI", "B000EHSVN2", "B008KZX7W0", "B001TKJDNA", "B00AEFYM2S", "B000EHSVM8", "B007C8RZR4", "B0053O8AFK", "B000R9YLKY", "B000N6TYLW", "B000002N2P", "B000V86OKG", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B000W91RUG", "B000I0QLR8", "B002N5N5NE", "B00BT1XCOU", "B00A81MV3U", "0767808673", "B002BJGYV2", "0767827686", "B000HT3P6U", "B003Y5H5B0", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00BNWWYE4", "B00BUWD7E8", "B009LDD1X0", "B00IWTVDUW", "B001F7AQDS", "B008JFUS5A", "B008X6N8KW"], "bought_together": ["B0006ZM8M2", "B0001AW066"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005IA9JQI", "B0001AW066", "B003TNW04Y", "B005IA9JSG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 40813}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 15.58, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B0002WZN8K", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61BN59G5HAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Friends: Season 8"}

The case leads them to the headquarters of the Locus Solus company, where Batou uncovers the evil secret behind the creation of thegynoids.Innocenceincludes some staggeringly beautiful CG images, especially a parade depicting characters from Chinese mythology. Oshii contrasts this glittering beauty with aBlade Runner-esque dystopia.

{"description": "It would be hard to imagine a better performance of Donizetti's comic masterpiece. If there was one role that ideally suited Luciano Pavarotti's voice and stage personality, it was Nemorino, the impoverished and not-very-bright peasant who worships the village's prettiest and richest young woman from a distance, is swindled by a traveling vendor of \"miracle\" medicines, but wins her hand by dumb luck. The story has comedy, pathos, and a put-down of Wagner'sTristan und Isolde(or at least the Tristan story) written long before Wagner composed it.Kathleen Battle is not only a wonderful singer and convincing actress; as Adina,  she is pretty enough to make Nemorino's infatuation totally credible. Juan Pons struts convincingly as Belcore, Nemorino's self-important rival, and Enzo Dara is properly spectacular as Dr. Dulcamara, who sells Nemorino the magic potion guaranteed to improve his love life, or at least to get him drunk. The melodies in this opera include some of the best ever written, and James Levine, his extraordinary orchestra, and his wonderful chorus know exactly what to do with them.   Everything comes together in this production to make it one of the best opera DVDs available.--Joe McLellan", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EQHHJW", "B000787X00", "B000094HMU", "B000F3T3CS", "B0007Q6PBK", "B004QQDUZ6", "B00006CXFD", "B000050X2Z", "B002MEW7YY", "B000001GD4", "B0013V33DG", "B00406UK8W", "B000YCLRBA", "B007R5KKJW", "B002LL13BQ", "B005HS5RWQ", "B008K7RGA2", "B000050X2Y", "B000050X30", "B000YCLRAG", "B0007P0LNE", "B0001BPPO4", "B004ECFW7Q", "B0009K1ZHS", "B00579EKW8", "B0006O9M6S", "B00361DR4Q", "B002Y5FKZ4", "B000B8ISPK", "B000T0XEGS", "B005MYEQ9U", "B00012AST0", "B00579EK50", "B003ELZL0Q", "0793553725", "B00008DDRN", "B00005ONMJ", "B003Y58CKI", "B008O2T3O0", "B00008DDRL", "B00H540KMM", "B00DPMFE6U", "B00IAV08DK", "B00BJGXRP4", "B0054YIQLW", "B000A3VTT8", "B000068UXJ", "B000050X31", "B000W7Y6BA", "B001CZVVV4", "B00005V15Q", "B000083C73", "B00CU55HMY", "B001DHE9KG", "B000A0XS0Y", "B0020XT9RK", "B00I3LDEFQ", "B000E6EGXW", "B008ROGZUK", "B00008DDRJ", "B005G02RIC", "B000E5KOJI", "B000ASAEQW", "B002YOJBYG", "B00DPMFEQA", "B00DGPHKAO", "B00023BN5G", "B001CZVVWI", "B0009I8PHS", "B000OONQ1M", "B004QQDUOW", "B001BWQVW2", "B0000041QJ", "B001A5REB2", "0738919039", "B0007Q6PBU", "B00014NE5I", "B007CYKHIW", "B0007P0LOS", "B000NVL49W", "B000VZAV62", "B004CPJC8U", "B002HWBS96", "B001RPZDW2", "B0009K7J5A", "B00CU55HHY", "B00H540M9S", "B0001Z65O4", "B000093FQI", "B00005BI90", "B00019GH8E", "B0009W4LLS", "B0055ISACW", "B001RPZDXG", "B0039I1HN4", "B0012NO92O", "B00020HEPW", "B007R5I6XO", "B00EWT17I4", "B00002NDLW"], "bought_together": ["B000F3T3CS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000F3T3CS", "B000YCLRAG", "B000001GD4", "B000E6EGXW"]}, "price": 24.96, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Classical"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Opera & Classical Vocal"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 137689}, "asin": "B000787WZQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51gvVZlrG8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Donizetti - L'Elisir d'Amore"}
{"description": "Omar Naim's The Final Cut is startlingly different than a conventional science fiction film. It's a compelling fable that offers a vision of a world where memory implants record all moments of a person's life. Post mortem, these memories are removed and edited by a \"Cutter\" into a reel depicting the life of the departed for a commemorative ceremony, called a Rememory.

{"description": "Based on the beloved autobiographical novel by Elspeth Huxley, BBC miniseriesThe Flame Trees of Thikabrings an eventful childhood in Eastern Africa to vivid life. In 1913, 11-year-old Elspeth Grant (Holly Aird) traveled with her mother, Tilly (Hayley Mills), from England to Kenya to help build a coffee plantation. (Born in 1907, Huxley was actually six at the time.) Her father, Robin (David Robb), who had preceded them, was waiting to greet his family in the arid town of Thika. Also waiting for them were lions, elephants, giraffes, and countless other creatures (the 18-week production was filmed on location in Kenya).Directed by Roy Ward Baker (A Night To Remember) and written by John Hawkesworth (Upstairs, Downstairs),The Flame Trees of Thikaisn't just about one girl, or one family, adrift in an occasionally hostile foreign land, but also about the dangers of colonialism. The Grants, their neighbors, the Palmers (Nicholas Jones and Sharon Maughan), and most of the other Europeans in Thika feel certain they're bringing culture to the uncivilized, without realizing what they're destroying in the process. Ian Crawford (Ben Cross fromChariots of Fire), is one possible exception to the rule, but he brings another kind of danger in his pursuit of Mrs. Palmer.Since their actions are seen through the eyes of a child,The Flame Trees of Thikais never preachy, but the meddling of these adults--however well intentioned--in the affairs of the Masai, the Kikuyu, and other locals frequently creates tension. As Tilly notes, \"It's like two whole separate circles revolving around each other--their world and ours--and only just touching occasionally.\" What began as Elspeth's coming-of-age story, becomes one for her parents, as well, in this sensitive and engaging series.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Under intense scrutiny, the debut season ofEnterpriseearned a passing grade from critics andStar Trekfans alike.Voyagerended its seven-season run just four months earlier, and fans were skeptical whenEnterprisepremiered (on Sept. 26, 2001, on UPN) with a theme song (\"Where My Heart Will Take Me,\" composed by Diane Warren and performed by Russell Watson) that defiedTrek's revered theme-music tradition. This and other early reservations were dispelled when \"Broken Bow\" got the series off to a satisfying start, beginning in the year 2151 and establishing a pre-Federation focus on humanity's delicate relationship with the Vulcans, the controversial launch of the NX-01Enterpriseon an exploratory mission, and the potentially devastating consequences of the mysterious Temporal Cold War involving a time-traveling splinter group of the Suliban, a nomadic alien race. While establishing a testy relationship betweenEnterpriseCapt. Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) and his smart-and-sexy Vulcan Sub-Commander, T'Pol (Jolene Blalock, in a short-banged wig and form-fitting \"catsuit\" that were later redesigned), the series introduced engineer \"Trip\" Tucker (Connor Trineer), whose surprise development in \"Unexpected\" made him a fan favorite; communications officer Hoshi Sato (Linda Park); helmsman Travis Mayweather (Anthony Montgomery); weapons expert Lt. Malcolm Reed (Dominic Keating), and chief surgeon Dr. Phlox (John Billingsley), a well-mannered Denobulan recruit from Earth's Interspecies Medical Exchange.As a \"prequel' series that predates theoriginalStar Trekby 150 years,Enterprisebuilt upon establishedTreklore with episodes involving Vulcans (\"Breaking the Ice\"), Klingons (\"Sleeping Dogs\"), the blue-skinned Andorians (\"The Andorian Incident,\" \"Shadows of P'Jem\"), and the Ferengi (\"Acquisition\") while offering stand-alone episodes (notably \"Dear Doctor,\" \"Fortunate Son,\" and \"Shuttlepod One\") that further acquainted fans with theEnterpriseregulars. EarlyTrektechnology is also introduced (including \"phase pistols\" and the rarely used, still-risky transporter), and the series drew strength from what many felt would be its primary weakness: unwritten history and the initial indecisiveness of Archer's bold foray into the unknown. Ending with a dazzling \"Shock Wave\" cliffhanger that leaves Archer stranded in a decimated Temporal Cold War future,Enterpriseset a strong foundation for the events of season 2.The bonus features included on theEnterprise: Season OneDVDs are almost worth the price of the set, if only to see nearly nine minutes of hilarious outtakes, maintaining a beloved tradition ofStar Trekbloopers. The sight (and sound) of Jolene Blalock laughing out of character is pure gold, and it shouldn't surprise anyone that Blalock is just as smart as she is sexy, as proven by her astute observations (along with the rest of theEnterprisecast) in the \"Cast Impressions\" featurette. It's the usual complimentary fluff included with allTreksets, but it's obviously sincere, confirming fans' conviction thatEnterpriseshould have lasted beyond four seasons with this close-knit ensemble. Series creators Brannon Braga and Rick Berman deliver a typically dry commentary on \"Broken Bow,\" setting the record straight on debate over the show's \"not retro enough\" production design (as Braga notes, \"you can never please everyone\") while defining their concept of \"The Right StuffofStar Trek.\" As always, Mike Okuda's text commentaries offer a wealth ofTrektrivia and detail fromTrek's historical canon.Fans will love the \"Enterprise Secrets\" revealing low-tech solutions to lighting the warp core and dispensing \"replicator\" beverages, along with an entertaining profile of Vaughan \"Admiral Forrest\" Armstrong, who holds the record forTrekguest appearances. The other featurettes are perfunctory, but \"CreatingEnterprise\" provides valuable first-season perspective, and the \"Time Travel\" feature offers a handy reference for the many time-travel episodes from everyTrekseries. As usual, Easter eggs (three of them, titled \"NX-01 Files\") are hidden on the special-features menu, offering short interview clips culled from the primary featurettes. The deleted scenes demonstrate how non-essential material can be sacrificed, and because they don't include post-production sound or visual effects, fans can see and hear the actual soundstage atmosphere ofEnterprise's principal photography.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009I7NGW", "B000A6CLL0", "B000AOEMXC", "B000127LW2", "B0001NBNFW", "B00005JLF5", "B0002JP4GE", "B00062IDCO", "B000228EBS", "B00062IDLA", "B0002WZTCA", "B00008972H", "B00008KA57", "B00008KA59", "B00008KGT0", "B00008KA5A", "B00008KA58", "B000063V8T", "B000063V8S", "B000063V8R", "B00005Y1NF", "B00BHWG0CM", "B00BHWG0DQ", "B000VDDDY6", "B0017VG69U", "B000062XFG", "B001DHXT3Y", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00AZMFJYA", "B000HEWEJ4", "B00062RCC6", "B002I9Z8GM", "B00062IDDS", "B00CYQXHLC", "B003H9LIRK", "B001DHXT6G", "B00BHWG1AI", "B00GX7D5G0", "1476706743", "B0000658PQ", "B00005JM3A", "B000RZIGVS", "B00IXPWGIS", "B00IWTVDUW", "B00BD6K54G", "B000AOEMXM", "B00KTZALDC", "B000BNI90Y", "B00HMVGHJI", "B002I9Z8EO", "B002I9Z8I0", "B002BWP2IK", "B00BHWG0G8", "B000E5N6B6", "B002GP7ZV4", "1601255888", "B00E3QJ7JC", "6302020190", "B003L77GWE", "1476765510", "B0009JE6G6", "B000ELL1QC", "B00K7IPFSM", "B000P5FH44", "B00F3L8P26", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B000F8O2PQ", "B007USBGSA", "B00HT851LO", "B000CCBCIA", "B00IKM5LXG", "B004HYW84G", "1451607156", "B000W4KT9G", "B004EXWGHY", "6303961614", "B00HUPC5X8", "B000B8IA2G", "B000F8O2Q0", "B005PPMHO2", "1476757267", "B0048FUUAI", "1476753075", "B00J11U4T6", "B000F8O2PG", "B00129W6LE", "B001RHGRTS", "B000E991A2", "B003ZFC9M4", "B002VA59ZS", "B002EL4RLQ", "B002HWRYJE", "B002BAW6GS", "B00466H3A4", "B002BAW6FE", "B002GP7ZVO", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B000F8O2OM", "B000F8O2P6", "B002U0KHME"], "bought_together": ["B0009I7NGW", "B000A6CLL0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0009I7NGW", "B000A6CLL0", "B000063V8U", "B001DHXT6G"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 57282}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 24.25, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B0007TKH66", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519SQSGBG7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek Enterprise - The Complete First Season"}
{"description": "Marvel Comics'Fantastic Fouranimated series (1994-95)--depicting the first family of superheroes--got significantly better as it went along.  The series always had good intentions, borrowing plots, concepts, characters, and even lines of dialogue from the classicStan Lee-Jack Kirby comic booksthat kicked off the Marvel age of comics.  And it was willing to spend two or even three episodes on a single story line.  The early episodes, however, had serious drawbacks, such as a clumsy animation style (the Silver Surfer never looked less noble), weak humor (the origin episode created a framing sequence in which the FF appears on theDick Cavett Show), and an awful theme song by Giorgio Moroder (Flashdance,Top Gun).  Fortunately, the animation improved in the second season, and instrumental theme music replaced the song.  Memorable moments from the series include the monumental Frightful Four-Inhumans tie-in and Galactus's search for a new herald. Memorable characters include villains Doctor Doom, the Skrulls, the Mole Man, and the Puppet Master, and heroes Daredevil, the Black Panther, Thor, and the Hulk. Guest voices include Ron Perlman, Michael Dorn, Kathy Ireland, Mark Hamill, and John Rhys-Davies.  It's worth a look for FF fans, especially in the complete four-disc set that contains all 29 episodes, a welcome change from Disney's single-disc compilations of theSpider-Manseries from the same time period.  (Ages 8 and older: cartoon action, threatening situations, some mature concepts)--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0036EH3XO", "B00157OI9Q", "B003XTUAHS", "B0036EH3XY", "B001QIVEVE", "B002DYKPF6", "B002DYKPFQ", "B001QIVEVO", "B000TSTEMS", "B000089G5S", "B007549WKI", "B0029WGIDK", "B00LT1JHLW", "B007IKKSNY", "B004MYYHG8", "B00A8GBVOK", "B008FYZHLK", "B0000VCZLG", "B00IGVJH0E", "B005BXY1PG", "B004MYYHGI", "B00007G205", "B007549XLG", "B003XTUAWI", "B005BXY1RE", "B004SB72HQ", "B003HKN548", "B0001I55O2", "B007ILZAA4", "B002A5EBLW", "B00006II6Q", "B00I40K6RU", "B000OY9V7K", "B008G33MN0", "B0000633UA", "B00D97DLYS", "B000PC8AKK", "B004I9SJSE", "B00HRUQ8S4", "B00CM0DIT6", "B00AWHDFHQ", "B00HXH00YE", "B004PHE9FQ", "B00LBHOCHS", "B00HMOW9YM", "B00L9SXSCE", "B002DQL34G", "B00BACT1I4", "B001KP2J2Q", "B002WNUVK2", "B0007RT9MG", "B0001I55N8", "B000TSTEJG", "B000GYI336", "B00I099JZK", "B006WNSHZO", "B00CPEK3NI", "B00BTJV9RO", "B00DVKKWFE", "B00C7A8WY2", "B00DYV1ROK", "B00FM4S7KO", "B000LE17A2", "B002K0WBDM", "B00368PSIM", "B004EXWGJW", "B00ISDJUYI", "B002LWJ510", "B000OY9V7A", "B00CENSU1W", "B006WDWBK6", "B000OPODNQ", "B0080730FM", "B00AQ590IC", "B009OAWMK8", "B004RBC5LA", "B00HMOWA0A", "B006UKX5V0", "B00005JNTU", "B003M8NGLC", "B00JPS7HOA", "B005EKWZD6", "B006PA0WF2", "B0018BDDFE", "B007RG8ZF2", "B003CS28UC", "B00BBAQD6S", "B001HRS8HW", "B000B7QCGS", "B000CSTK42", "B0002W4SY0", "B0007XFZMS", "B0002ZMHWM", "B005BYBZQ8", "B000B7QCHC", "B004AUCDK6", "B000W2C28Y", "B00LNBQ8SI", "B005EXA87S", "B0081BEZXS"], "bought_together": ["B0036EH3XO", "B001QIVEVE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001QIVEVE", "B001QIVEVO", "B002DYKPF6", "B002DYKPFQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 19159}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B0007US7CQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519XN1TVT6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fantastic Four: The Complete 1994-95 Animated Television Series"}

Caught in a catastrophic series of otherworldly events, the two become inextricably involved and seek to find their own peace at whatever cost.DVD Features:Additional Scenes:18 minutes of Deleted Scenes with Optional Commentary by Francis LawrenceAlternate endingsAudio CommentaryDocumentaries:THE PRODUCTION FROM HELL *Director's Confessional *Collision with Evil *Holy Relics IMAGINING THE UNDERWORLD *Hellscape *Visualizing Vermin *Warrior Wings *Unholy Abduction *Demon Face [Easter Egg] FORESIGHT: THE POWER OF PRE-VISUALIZATION with Optional Commentary by Francis LawrenceDocumentary:Conjuring Constantine: from comic book to movieFeaturette:Imagining the Underworld * Hellscape * Visualizing Vermin * Warrior Wings * Unholy Abduction * Demon Face [Easter Egg]Music Video:A Perfect Circle's \"Passive\" music videoTheatrical Trailer", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305065551", "B00111YM5G", "B0021L8V34", "B0002KVUKM", "6305718954", "B000FS9FCG", "B005JJCMOO", "B001SGEUYW", "B001DJLD1M", "B00005JM5B", "B001VLFE7G", "B002ZG98N2", "0767802454", "B003HKN52U", "B004SIP9Z6", "B001QTXM5Y", "B002GSXKNI", "B001AK3S4Y", "B0007P0Y7C", "B00011CZRE", "B001BP4K22", "B0000TPA0G", "B0013J55B6", "B00AEFXCLU", "B00003CXND", "B001F7MSFM", "B0085A9HU6", "B0002IQMAM", "B0013FDM7E", "B002ZG97CO", "B0006GANOQ", "B000069I1I", "B0000959N0", "B002GIBVWA", "B004P7CMOQ", "B002SG7Z7A", "B003YOZNBU", "B00003CXZ1", "B004EPYZO4", "B00111YM5Q", "B001BRJZPW", "B002ZG997C", "B000HEWEE4", "078322799X", "6305767866", "B0007DFJ0G", "B007D5E7C2", "B00005JA8B", "B00005JN0T", "B008JFUPPI", "B00HEPDGKA", "B0021L8UXA", "6304712499", "B002LMSWN2", "B002O3Z4XY", "B000EQHXN2", "B000274T94", "B001QB9H1U", "0780624890", "B00005JN0W", "B001GUYB08", "B001GKJ2E8", "B002O3Z50Q", "B000TGJ80S", "B0007PALZ2", "B00FEHCQEC", "B002GHHHN8", "B00AEFYGBA", "B0006L0LOS", "B00005JPD0", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B000FGGE68", "B000K4WPCC", "B003PIUIIS", "B000NQRR1Q", "B002O5M4T4", "B0045HCJGC", "B00BEJL6JK", "1558908846", "B000BTJDGC", "B000P0J0AQ", "B000TJ6PBK", "B00AEFY5B6", "B006VRRGNK", "B008JFUNYG", "B00195FUDC", "B00004BZIY", "B001DHXT20", "B00006FDCD", "B000NTMA0Q", "B000JMK6LW", "B0000844I8", "B00005JOC9", "B00005JLKN", "B00005UQ9W", "B000QXDED6", "B002O3Z510", "0783240295", "B00005JN5E", "B000XA5K48"], "bought_together": ["6305065551"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002KVUKM", "B00634MLIQ", "B0021L8V34", "6305065551"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 46632}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 26.0, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0009KA7BS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K-5Yf0UrL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Constantine (Two-Disc Deluxe Edition)"}
{"description": "Revelationsis a spooky, classy thriller depicting the world as a battleground between satanists and those who adhere to miracles revealing God's divine plan for humanity. Bill Pullman stars as Harvard scientist Bill Massey, whose successful quest to bring his daughter's seemingly demon-possessed serial killer to justice turns him into a well-known debunker of others who claim to speak for the Beastmaster. Problem is, the man who killed Massey's girl appears to be the real thing, endowed with prophetic powers and a second sight that comes in handy when it's time to go after the grieving hero's other child.Enter Sister Josepha (Natascha McElhone), a miracles investigator whose work is financially supported by a famous billionaire but disowned by the Vatican. Josepha has been led to Massey through a brain-dead girl who, though medically impossible, quotes scripture and has drawn a map to his office. Despite his skepticism, Massey teams with the nun in search of a kidnapped baby who may very well be the Christ-child in His just-in-time-for-Armageddon second coming. Written by David Seltzer (Dragonfly), and directed by occasionalBuffyhelmer David Semel and Lili Fini Zanuck (Rush),Revelationshas an appealing vitality (especially when Massey and Sister Josepha become targets for assassins), a nice Hollywood gloss, and an unsettling air of mystery, as if angels and demons really are duking it out for dominion of the Earth right under our noses.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002XNT1C", "B002UNXS68", "B000051S4T", "B0009JE6G6", "B0038N9X22", "B00175GAHE", "B000GFLEKY", "B0051GOB2G", "B002H6NVOC", "B0002S94BQ", "B00005UF7J", "B00D6I7HH2", "B00008IAKP", "B0037AGB9O", "B002TVQ4C6", "B00JF5GAZA", "B0009JE6FM", "B000E5N6B6", "B000N3T0EG", "B008B49F4Y", "B000087F10", "B0036EH3UC", "B008ZRKIQ6", "B000GYI340", "B0012IX35S", "B00AQSN620", "B00023BKMC", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B004LROMS4", "B00005JM39", "B003PGNBO8", "B00006IUGH", "B004RUEXVQ", "B001CQONMC", "B008L0YN22", "B000MMMTD2", "B000FJH5M2", "B00277Q2U6", "B000051S4V", "B007VJ5D14", "B00DPUB56U", "B000FOPPBA", "B00720OO0S", "B002T7X4UK", "B00E0KWBAI", "B001HUWQEA", "B00E3QJ7JC", "B00IWTVDXO", "B0001WTVUW", "B0024FAR66", "B000NJL4QC", "B007I1Q4W2", "B00BBE962W", "B007Q0JJIQ", "B00005R5GL", "B00B4804LM", "1450700551", "B002Z2X7GU", "B002JVWR4U", "B00061QJSK", "B0017IVHHO", "B000I0QLQY", "B00000K3TO", "B00062IDEW", "B001715A92", "B00007GZYC", "B000FSMEB0", "B000BNI90Y", "B000056HP5", "B001CFEBW0", "B000OHZJSC", "B00B04NIZO", "6305718954", "B00003CXQA", "B00AFEYS9A", "B00466H3A4", "B003UCA4XI", "B00803PFXG", "B001GKJ2E8", "0780622561", "B0085A9HU6", "B0081QF6Q8", "B002ZCY872", "B000PMFS2I", "B0002V7OI8", "B000CNE0SS", "B00070FX5U", "B0026ZQBK0", "B0009WFF8Q", "B000A2XAPK"], "bought_together": ["B0002XNT1C", "B00175GAHE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000051S4T", "B000087F10", "B00175GAHE", "B000B82TIC"]}, "price": 13.32, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 61072}, "asin": "B0009NCQGY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZWHFX3MSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Revelations"}
{"description": "Broadcast to record ratings on the TNT cable network, thisRaiders-esque adventure does not go by the book, staring with its atypical action hero and his decidedly uncool profession. Flynn Carsen (Noah Wylie fromE.R.) is a thirtysomething perpetual student who still lives with his mother (Olympia Dukakis). When his exasperated professor finally ejects him into the real world, Carsen's Holmesian deductive acumen lands him a job as the librarian at the Metropolitan Library. This is not an ordinary library. It houses history's most mythic artifacts, including the Ark of the Covenant, Pandora's Box, and the sword Excalibur. The fate of the world is in Carsen's hands (\"That's so sad,\" he observes) when the dread Serpent Brotherhood steals the library's Spear of Destiny, and Carsen must retrieve it. His reluctant, and antagonistic, partner is Nicole (Sonya Walger), who is as skilled in martial arts as Carsen is schooled in the Dewey Decimal System. Bob Newhart and Jane Curtin add welcome comic relief, with Newhart, of all people, getting into the action by film's end. The humble hero (who would rather be known as \"Flynn, the rather pleasant at parties\"), somewhat cheesy special effects, and corny comedy makeThe Librariana fun guilty pleasure. As Carsen proclaims, \"Being a librarian is actually a cool job.\" This looks like the beginning of a beautiful franchise.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000IJ7A24", "B001MVYUQG", "B001RXDM1I", "B0002J58GU", "B003KW7CQ0", "B003QJC208", "B001L2ZSFS", "B003XEKUBY", "B003MX91H0", "B004I1K2FK", "B0013BM63O", "B00K2CHW48", "B00005JN5E", "B00GOHZLDO", "B002ZG99KO", "B001GF8WP8", "B00BUELRXO", "B0009PBLU4", "B0000YEEPS", "B00FR23QNE", "B008L0YMVE", "B00K2CHWYI", "B00F3L8P26", "B00FE5MX74", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00IWTVDUW", "6305428514", "B004LROMWU", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B00GTZWXYQ", "B00AEBB8QK", "0792839137", "B000BW7QWW", "B00005JM5B", "B0016Q2D5M", "B00KS9V6EC", "B00HJAB094", "B004UXVDOA", "B003UYUQZW", "B0006GAOCW", "B004LROMS4", "B00ECW9UJY", "B00F84H73Q", "B003L77FYS", "B009RX7IX8", "B009AMAKWM", "B001XRLWPQ", "B002NZK5RI", "B0011FLGZQ", "B003F3NDWG", "B00LG6XHDY", "B000MMMTD2", "B00K2CHX9C", "B000Y11BC6", "B00IYRLUAU", "B000KJU18C", "B005TTEG5W", "B000ASATYY", "B00EIXWMII", "B0014C2FX8", "B00E5I2M6I", "B008JFUNTG", "B00GSTHC7G", "B0041PSQF6", "B0090SI56Y", "B003R4ZMPE", "B00DL48BM6", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B00E5I2M9K", "B007R6DJP8", "B00BEIYH1A", "B004LWZW4M", "B005G4TJUC", "B002NZK5WS", "B00B9UEOPC", "B00AEFY3MC", "B00D6I7GHS", "B00J11U54K", "6305236569", "B00AIBZMD6", "B006WK4Y8Q", "B0056GLNQI", "B0053O89KG", "B00GTZWUPS", "B00HF98SHG", "B000FO0AA6", "B008JFUO72", "B00GZP0M2K", "B007CF6S1Q", "006219481X", "0783232047", "B0006GANOQ", "B00FEVZ960", "B005SZED64", "B004TJ1H3C", "B006WK4Y6I", "B00KQTHKQC", "B00BN0WQ5I", "B00AIBZMM2"], "bought_together": ["B000IJ7A24", "B001MVYUQG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005GELLQC", "B001MVYUQG", "B000IJ7A24", "B001RXDM1I"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 4677}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0009NSCRQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ark9kN2IL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Librarian - Quest for the Spear"}
{"description": "The sci-fi-themed teen dramaRoswellbegins its third and final season with Max (Jason Behr) and Liz (Shiri Appleby) back together and taking a desperate chance to find Max's son.  After the many cosmic concepts of the previous season, the series dialed back the mythology to focus on the more--excuse the expression--humanaspects of the characters.Roswellwas often described asDawson's CreekmeetsThe X-Files, and accordingly Isabel (Katherine Heigl) finds romance with a lawyer (Adam Rodriguez), but struggles both with her mixed feelings about revealing her alien identity and with the aftermath of the tragedy in season 2.  (The romance is later spoofed in aBewitched-style episode.) At the same time, Max and Michael (Brendan Fehr) travel to Los Angeles in search of an alien bounty hunter that might be able to help them find Max's son.  (They also findRoswellexecutive producer Jonathan Frakes making a guest appearance as himself.)  Michael takes a night job that at first is played for laughs (in \"Michael, the Gang, and the Great Snapple Caper\"), then takes on threatening implications in a rousing two-parter that eventually leaves all parties not too much different from how they started.  Michael also struggles in his relationship with Maria (Majandra Delfino), first when he makes new friends and later when she meets a figure from her past (Clayne Crawford) who revives a longtime music dream that might lead to bigger things.  All the while, the alien trio faces the constant struggle of keeping their identities secret, even as the net seems to be tightening around them.  When a key character returns in the series' penultimate episode, both the aliens and the humans they love face a critical decision.TheDawson's Creekcomparison is also valid in an undesirable way: many of the background songs that characterized the series have been replaced for DVD due to licensing expenses.  Newcomers to the series, of course, probably won't notice.  Four episodes have commentary tracks, two by Frakes, who has some interesting information but leaves dead air and introduces characters we already know.  Better are the tracks by executive producer/writer Ronald D. Moore on theBewitchedspoof and by creator Jason Katims on the series finale.  Other features are a 13-minute summary of the season and Shiri Appleby's appearance on Japanese TV to publicize the DVD release of the first season in 2004.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00133QNS6", "B00133QNRW", "B000NOKFGW", "B00005YU87", "B002QZDSW4", "B001ILFUB4", "B0009A407A", "B000F3UAE8", "B000FJH5M2", "B000OCXNQW", "B0001907BC", "B000O77SN6", "B0009JE6FC", "B0011FLGZQ", "B00177YA10", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B00166UFTI", "B000092T3Y", "B0006J28DW", "B003R0MF6W", "B000O77SMW", "B000I0QLR8", "B00IWTVDUW", "B0077PTWHI", "B0051GOB2G", "B0001I55S8", "B0002234R2", "B00022FWEU", "B00JF5G8WU", "B0009JE6G6", "B000BOH990", "B0002XVKMM", "B002HMTX84", "B000AO9BSS", "B002ETTGD2", "B000I0QLRI", "B00008AOX3", "B000EXDS3E", "B000VSDNFA", "B0077PTWY6", "B0024FAR66", "B000CNE0T2", "B000I0QLQY", "B000BNXD6O", "B000QDLSR0", "B00HQOFAKI", "B0037AGB9O", "B005DCJ0Q0", "B000EXDS3Y", "B000EXDS34", "B000FOPPBA", "B00127RAGM", "B001CQONMC", "B0007V6IW6", "B004SMDJ9U", "B000EHSVMS", "B000BOH98G", "B000CNE0SS", "B0001IN0T4", "B002JVWR4U", "B000EHSVM8", "B0024FAD9C", "B0000E5NPY", "B001MVWRN4", "B00HUPC5X8", "B00GHH9HBI", "B0002RQ3MK", "B00GHH9IAI", "B00005JM39", "B001MVWRMU", "0671035649", "B004WO9OMA", "B000EAT23C", "B00B5ARKC0", "B001MVWRMK", "B000EHSVLE", "B009LDCWWG", "0671035614", "B003L77GWE", "B000I0QLS2", "B001MVWRNE", "B000EHSVKK", "B000YDOOEQ", "B000CNE0TC", "B008X6N8KW", "B0006UEVUE", "B0085KGG96", "B00CRVL5ZE", "B00BD6K54G", "B005X4P3DC", "B007AFC0W4", "B001MVWRNO", "B001B7CNZ6", "B001DF681G", "B000I0QLRS", "B00DPJEWD4", "B004YPED14", "B002N5N5MK", "B000SULWKO", "B004TJ1H3C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00133QNS6", "B00133QNRW", "B000NOKFGW", "B000JJ6K0Q"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 133486}, "asin": "B0009NZ2RY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5183MTPXA7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Roswell - The Complete Third Season (The Final Chapter)"}

{"description": "\"Editing is what makes film afilm.\" That audacious statement is made at the beginning of this 2005 documentary about the art of film editing. After listening to many editors and directors, movie novices as well as cinephiles may agree. Kathy Bates narrates this whirlwind history of the art punctuated by dozens of scenes to illustrate the effect of film editing in heightening reality and making a visceral impact on the filmgoer. In fact, the profession seems to be run on \"a gut feeling\" whether it's clipping a few frames, or 20 minutes of the final act (which we learn happened withLenny). James Cameron illustrates the importance of a frame as we see a scene fromTerminator 2with 1 frame out 24 missing (24 frames representing one second of film). Or as Quentin Tarantino states, \"musicians have notes, editors have frames.\" It's fascinating to see how editing--the process of assembling the film after it's been shot--can save films, make performances better, and become the ultimate jigsaw puzzle. The last concept is demonstrated as we return time and again to the most well-known editor of the time, Walter Murch (Apocalypse Now,The English Patient), as he edits a few scenes fromCold Mountainin front of us.

{"description": "In 1952 Superman flew right into the hearts and minds of the American TV audience faster than a speeding bullet. Though most people were already familiar with man of steel through his comic books, as well as the popular radio show, it was the new medium'sAdventures of Supermanthat transformed our resident Kryptonian into a timeless icon. For many young baby boomers, Superman was the ultimate symbol of truth, justice and the American way. After watching this nostalgic trip back in time it is easy to see why: George Reeves. Reeves is the quintessential Superman. He is kind, confident, smart, always does the right thing and can literally do anything physically.  Even Reeves' Clark Kent is cool, even cocky without any of the trademarked shy, clumsy and hickish traits the character has developed over the years. And then there's Phyllis Coates as the Lois Lane. Coates portrayal of Lois is surprisingly one of the stronger female roles in '50s television.  She is one tough cookie able to stand her ground against criminals, fight off bad guys and is not afraid to outwardly express herself. Sadly, Phyllis Coates would be replaced by Noel Neill in subsequent seasons.Adventures of Supermanalso stands the test of time well as one of the best shows from the early days of television. A lot of it has to do with how the writers, producers and actors approached the making of the show.  This first season, as well as the second, were made as if they were making a serious show suitable for kids and adults. Instead of being a kids' comic book show, the episodes have a strong \"mini-serial-crime-movie\" feel, are very story driven and include loads of elements from the popular film noir style of the 1950s. This is evident in such classic episodes such as the season opener \"Superman on Earth,\" \"The Stolen Costume\" where Superman has his costume stolen by a burglar, and the tense horror-noir \"The Haunted Lighthouse.\" Also included on this DVD set is the 1951 theatrical releaseSuperman and The Mole Menwhich later became the televised two-part episode \"The Unknown People.\" --Rob Bracco", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BT96FA", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B000HWZ4E8", "B000I8OM94", "B000AQOHNA", "B00LT1JHLW", "B001OD8E4G", "B000FO0AHY", "B004BBHVIS", "B000OPODNQ", "B00BBXSPCK", "6305943389", "B0007G89FU", "B00BBXSPES", "B001DJ7Q0E", "B00080ZG2O", "B000BT96EG", "B000EU1Q2M", "B00AKK6MD4", "B00G7QPX6C", "B004EXWGJW", "B00005LOUK", "B002K0WBDM", "B00DX88IL4", "B000KWZ7JC", "B00HFWETQW", "0445040548", "B00082ZROO", "B000P6XQ50", "B00HMOWA0A", "B001DJLD2G", "B00004Y2QO", "B00IF0KAYS", "B002KVSJ6O", "B002F3BPWW", "B00080ZG2E", "B0001ZMWYG", "B001992NXI", "B0006Z2KZ2", "B000EHQTZO", "B00C7QD8MC", "B0025Y3SZS", "B001JFKWE4", "B00801OMDM", "B000BGR1B4", "B0012EI8BQ", "B001D2WUCA", "B000ION23U", "B000BF0C8E", "B001CDFY5U", "B00BDZV4PQ", "B009M4KT3I", "B000BZISS0", "B00KH57U60", "B00DXLO0BI", "B0000648YD", "B00308B170", "B00KUS5YGC", "B0002F6BJW", "B000IJ79UW", "B000IJ79X4", "B000HWZ4BG", "B000IJ79VQ", "B0047XGYRO", "B004PQM81E", "B0002W4SPO", "B000N6UF10", "B00ESFUED6", "B000RO9PTQ", "B0002NRRRE", "B00E96AY20", "B00HMOW9YM", "B005TZFYWA", "B001SGN1JM", "B000051SH3", "B00005UWA8", "B000OPODNG", "B00DZP1C0O", "B000X07SQ6", "B00JPUUSEE", "B000F9SUP8", "B00DGNFMNS", "B00DGNFMJW", "B00D3DJH7S", "B000LXGXY8", "B00005JO3P", "B000K7VHYG", "B0057Q8QO4", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B00HETMEZE", "B00BPDBEO2", "B000EBGE9G", "B005ZKCG3E", "B000W8OM68", "B00062IYW8", "B00KHA88PC", "B0041KKBJK", "B000LV6W00", "B00005JM5Z", "B006WN5W5M"], "bought_together": ["B000BT96FA", "B000EU1Q3Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000HWZ4GQ", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B000HWZ4E8", "B000BT96FA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 19626}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 11.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000A5046K", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61KExWvkZML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Adventures of Superman: Season 1"}
{"description": "Yogi Bear began as a secondary character onThe Huckleberry Hound Show(1958), but he proved so popular, he was given his own series in 1961. A conniver and a schemer, Yogi frequently proclaimed he was \"smarter than the average bear.\" His gentle pal Boo Boo always pointed out that Ranger Smith wasn't going to like his latest plot to steal \"picanic\" baskets from visitors to Jellystone Park, but that never stopped Yogi.The Yogi Bear Showalso featured Snagglepuss, a bright pink lion whose, \"Exit, stage left\" became a catch phrase among kids, and Yakky Doodle, a self-consciously cute little duck.    More than one critic noted that Yogi sounded a lot like Art Carney's Ed Norton character onThe Honeymooners, just as Snagglepuss's voice bore more than a passing resemblance to Bert Lahr's Cowardly Lion. But the sound-alike formula proved popular, and Hanna-Barbera used it many times.The Yogi Bear Show: The Complete Seriesincludes all 32 cartoons featuring each of the starring characters. The show's finale was a birthday party special with appearances by Huckleberry Hound, Quick Draw McGraw, and other visitors from various Hanna-Barbera programs. Only a few extras are included in the set; the most fun is \"Time Capsule Yogi,\" which offers the theme song, interstitial gags, and commercials.The Yogi Bear Showmay not have been great animation, but it was an essential part of growing up in '60s America, and this set is sure to delight baby boomers who watched it as kids. (Unrated, suitable for ages 6 and older: cartoon violence, occasional ethnic stereotypes)--Charles Solomon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000AOEMU0", "B0002ZMHW2", "B000FI9OEK", "B001E2PQA2", "B0002MFGDW", "B000FI9OEU", "B0001MZ7IC", "B0007QS31A", "B001QU880M", "B002GNOLXQ", "B000MTPA5Y", "B00961EO24", "B001RXDM22", "B0001CNQUS", "B002ZG99WW", "B00KBES386", "B003Z8ZCFW", "B000PC1PAW", "B004K5RN2O", "B0007QS31K", "B000ZBEOHY", "B00E44EZHC", "B00652FG7O", "B00BH418RW", "B000GG4XWE", "B000OY9V7A", "B004P8R9S4", "B000OY9V7K", "B0002ZMHVI", "B006JN86Z8", "B00LT1JHLW", "B001QU880W", "B000ZBEOHO", "B004ZRGSDM", "B00961ENYI", "B005BUA1CQ", "B0011XFOIS", "B000CEXG00", "B000AOEMTG", "B00080ZFZC", "B0007939QG", "B005FQ1ONG", "B00465I1BA", "B00553KAK2", "B005SQRYG4", "B002GNOLY0", "B00553K9R6", "B005EXA87S", "B0014VPFHW", "B000FQIRYU", "B000UAE7PE", "B004H0M304", "B00480OCWA", "B002T9H2MY", "B000RPD0DM", "B004176JHQ", "B001PMWLXQ", "B00009PJT0", "B005LOBWA2", "B00555ZT7Y", "B0029WGIDK", "B000P296AS", "B0062KMDWU", "B0002ABU5C", "B002VA5A16", "B000TSTEMS", "B003VADST6", "B000VKL706", "B0007XFZMS", "B00466X70Y", "B00BTHR0VK", "B00125WAY6", "B007RKFXWQ", "B003F3NE4S", "B007XTDWO2", "B0001MZ7J6", "B001VEF7ZM", "B00CGCKEYM", "B002H047OG", "B00005BJO4", "B005NFJAQC", "B000P6R9IA", "B0006FO5MS", "B002S3Y1LQ", "B004H0M340", "B004L9GM5S", "B009P3J61C", "B00FNR9ZN8", "B004M64QSK", "B009H3LNF2", "B007Q49X4C", "B000P6R9O4", "B003M9ZAC4", "B004ITYDT8", "B00I2YXN5A", "B00480OCWU", "B000E1JOYS", "B004176JIA", "B001B23ED6", "B00HMOW9YM"], "bought_together": ["B000AOEMU0", "B0002ZMHW2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000AOEMU0", "B001E2PQA2", "B002ZG99WW", "B0002MFGDW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 28659}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 25.66, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000AOEMUA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51dQHJT6h4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Yogi Bear Show - The Complete Series"}

Among them is the handsome gun hero Dum, who became unwillingly involved in the bandit life. Handsome Dum made a promise to his upper-crust lover Rumpoey: despite the class difference, they will get married. When the moment of reunion arrives, Dum gets involved in a fire fight and cannot possibly reach Rumpoey in time. She is desperate: her father has married her off to a policeman. The taciturn Dum, called the 'Black Tiger' by his co-conspirators, has however not forgotten Rumpoey. He does everything in his power to reach her, but fate gets in the way: his gang leader suspects him of treachery and his blood brother turns into his greatest enemy. Will the two lovers ever meet up? This urgent question propels the melodrama forward, supported by exciting music, spectacular shootouts and heroic duels.

{"description": "The latest entry in theHarry Pottersaga could be retitledFast Times at Hogwarts, where finding a date to the winter ball is nearly as terrifying as worrying about Lord Voldemort's return. Thus, the young wizards' entry into puberty (and discovery of the opposite sex) opens up a rich mining field to balance out the dark content in the fourth movie (and the stories are only going to get darker). Mike Newell (Four Weddings and a Funeral) handily takes the directing reins and eases his young cast through awkward growth spurts into true young actors. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe, more sure of himself) has his first girl crush on fellow student Cho Chang (Katie Leung), and has his first big fight with best bud Ron (Rupert Grint). Meanwhile, Ron's underlying romantic tension with Hermione (Emma Watson) comes to a head over the winter ball, and when she makes one of those girl-into-woman Cinderella entrances, the boys' reactions indicate they've all crossed a threshold.But don't worry, there's plenty of wizardry and action inGoblet of Fire. When the deadly Triwizard Tournament is hosted by Hogwarts, Harry finds his name mysteriously submitted (and chosen) to compete against wizards from two neighboring academies, as well as another Hogwarts student. The competition scenes are magnificently shot, with much-improved CGI effects (particularly the underwater challenge). And the climactic confrontation with Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes, in a brilliant bit of casting) is the most thrilling yet.Goblet, the first installment to get a PG-13 rating, contains some violence as well as disturbing images for kids and some barely shrouded references at sexual awakening (Harry's bath scene in particular). The 2 1/2-hour film, lean considering it came from a 734-page book, trims out subplots about house-elves (they're not missed) and gives little screen time to the standard crew of the otherPotterfilms, but adds in more of Britain's finest actors to the cast, such as Brendan Gleeson as Mad-Eye Moody and Miranda Richardson as Rita Skeeter. Michael Gambon, in his second round as Professor Dumbledore, still hasn't brought audiences around to his interpretation of the role he took over after Richard Harris died, but it's a small smudge in an otherwise spotless adaptation.--Ellen A.

{"description": "Rent, the show that in 1996 gave voice to a Broadway generation, has finally become an energetic, passionate, and touching movie musical. Based loosely on Puccini'sLa Boh&#xE8;me, it focuses on the year in the life of a group of friends in New York's East Village--\"bohemians\" who live carefree lives of art, music, sex, and drugs. Well, carefree until Mark, an aspiring filmmaker (Anthony Rapp), and Roger, an aspiring songwriter (Adam Pascal), find out they owe a year's rent to Benny (Taye Diggs), a former friend who had promised them free residence when he married the landlord's daughter. Roger has also attracted the attention of his downstairs neighbor, Mimi (Rosario Dawson), while Mark's former girlfriend, Maureen (Idina Menzel), has found a new romance in a lawyer named Joanne (Tracie Thoms). Philosophy professor Tom (Jesse L. Martin) finds his soul mate in drag queen Angel (Wilson Jermaine Heredia). But because this is the late-'80s, the threat of AIDS is always present.The remarkable thing aboutRentthe movie is that nearly 10 years after the show debuted onBroadway, six of the eight principals return in the roles they originated. They're a bit older than would be ideal for their characters, but they do have the advantage of having learned the show directly from creator Jonathan Larson (who died of an aortic aneurysm while the show was in previews), plus they started young--we're not exactly talking Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford here.  Alongside a polished performance like Rapp's--sometimes observer-commentator, sometimes participant in two of the score's showstoppers, \"The Tango Maureen\" and \"La Vie Boheme\"--the two new additions (Thoms in place of Fredi Walker, Dawson in place of the edgier Daphne Rubin-Vega) slip comfortably into the ensemble; the pivotal Dawson makes a seductive case as Mimi when she tempts Roger in the mesmerizing \"Light My Candle\" or burns up the stage of the Catscratch Club in \"Out Tonight.\"  Moviegoers who have an aversion to people who break into song while walking down the street probably won't have their minds changed byRent(even if they are singingrocksongs), and the gritty subject matter and lack of big-name stars make it unlikely to cross over to general audiences the wayChicagodid.  But fans of musicals should find \"Seasons of Love\" as stirring as ever, and the show's passionate admirers--the \"Rentheads\"--probably couldn't have wished for a more sympathetic director thanRentfan Chris Columbus, or a more faithful representation of the show they love.--David HoriuchiOn the DVDThree powerful musical numbers cut from the final film are the highlight of the two-disc DVD.  In the aftermath of the funeral scene, Anthony Rapp sings \"Halloween,\" and he, Adam Pascal, and Rosario Dawson share \"Goodbye Love\" (both songs were in the stage version). Then in an alternate ending, the cast finishes \"No Day But Today\" on the bare stage on which the film began.  There are worthwhile arguments for why these scenes were cut or replaced, so it's fortunate that the DVD lets us see these at all.  Those musical numbers have optional commentary by director Chris Columbus, Rapp, and Pascal (two other cut scenes have no commentary), including one funny moment in which Rapp explains in great detail the technical challenge of shooting \"Halloween\" only to have Columbus say, \"Yeah, but I don't know if that's the take we used.\"  The three also provide commentary on the film itself, with Columbus discussing various decisions, criticizing the critics, and marveling \"I still don't know how we got the PG-13,\" and Rapp and Pascal occasionally recalling differences in the stage version.The other whopper of a feature isNo Day But Today, a nearly two-hour documentary that uses video clips, still photographs, and interviews with family and friends to celebrate the short life of Jonathan Larson and his creation.  Topics include his early interest in musical theater (\"I want to write theHairfor the '90s.\"), the support of Stephen Sondheim, the impact of the AIDS epidemic, the long and difficult road ofRent(casting the show, Larson learning to collaborate, the transfer to a Broadway stage, and the Rentheads), and Larson's tragic death. The last 20 minutes covers the making of the film, director Chris Columbus, the decision to rely on most of the original cast (the only two principals who didn't appear in the movie, Daphne Rubin-Vega and Fredi Walker-Browne, are interviewed in earlier segments, but only mentioned in passing here), recording sessions, and location shooting.  If the movie ofRentwas a tribute to Jonathan Larson, the DVD is all that and more, a moving and incredibly detailed look at an extraordinary talent whom the world lost far too soon.--David HoriuchiMoreRentMovie soundtrackOriginal Broadway cast recordingAnthony Rapp'sWithout You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical \"Rent\"", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001LMAKAG", "B000AYEI4U", "B006ZZQMXS", "B000005ALT", "B004SEUJBE", "B0007TKNII", "B000077VR3", "B002D0L0R2", "0688154379", "B00AEBBAEK", "B000Z8R2VW", "B002G1K82Q", "B00GM7ZFAA", "B00JAOW3MA", "B00006D295", "B005S9EK5Y", "B0028SVXVM", "B00004XMTJ", "B001MT7ZEW", "B001GKJ2DY", "B006Z21ZFG", "6304806418", "0743269772", "B0000AM6IY", "B0000TB01Y", "B00070HK24", "B002NZK5TG", "B002ZG976U", "B00AEFY5TI", "B000EWBKMG", "B00008973A", "1423406265", "B00AEFXTKO", "B0013Z7RUC", "B00004W5VC", "B00GTO6WXU", "B000I2J6YG", "B000RPCK2E", "0800141806", "0743269764", "B00028HBIO", "0783240287", "B0007WFXZI", "0792841638", "B005QIOKBQ", "1938438175", "B005SFR7YE", "B003L77GAQ", "B001FB55OE", "B000E3LHSM", "B00001PE59", "0767827929", "B000J3OTSM", "B000UAE7NG", "B005LAIHR2", "B009NYF2GQ", "B00005JOFQ", "B002ZG99IG", "B0000VCZKM", "B00005O3VD", "B001HN69AY", "B000FIHN5M", "B0011U52E2", "B0000524E5", "B003H6Z0PO", "B006WZIB1C", "B004D9FLJE", "0061350966", "B0053O8A5K", "B001CTA1UM", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00133KFGW", "B000URDCC6", "B001LMAKAQ", "B0009JE57G", "B009LDD5E0", "B00003CYJ4", "B00001PE4D", "B005PTMPYA", "B00005OCMS", "B004VJJFDE", "B00003CXHG", "B00447L4KA", "B0002E5O9G", "B0009IOR6Q", "B001FAFO3W", "B005BUA1HQ", "B00C81AVNU", "B00004RF9K", "B00166UFSY", "B002D0L0QS", "B00AMEZDJW", "B00006RIO7", "B00FGEO7OK", "B000683VI4", "B001JV5BF8", "B00005UQ9W", "B00GB0ORJ8"], "bought_together": ["B001LMAKAG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001LMAKAG", "B000077VR3", "B004SEUIWO", "B005SFR7YE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7679}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.86, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000E1YVZU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61ZTKXS4AGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rent (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)"}
{"description": "In November, 1959, the shocking murder of a smalltown Kansas family captures the imagination of Truman Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman), famed author of \"Breakfast at Tiffany's.\"  With his childhood friend Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), writer of the soon-to-be published \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" Capote sets out to investigate, winning over the locals despite his flamboyant appearance and style.  When he forms a bond with the killers and their execution date nears, the writing of \"In Cold Blood,\" a book that will change the course of American Literature, takes a drastic toll on Capote, changing him in ways he never imagined.  Stellar performances from Hoffman and Keener, as well as Academy Award(r) winner Chris Cooper (Adaptation) are why critics are calling CAPOTE a \"must-see movie.\"", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SIP71M", "B0014GI6I2", "B008220DGE", "B000M341SC", "B0013XZ2QK", "B00112S8RS", "B002LVVCJY", "B0000AN4JE", "B00008WI9N", "B00AEBB8SS", "B001P3SA8K", "B00003CWTI", "B00005BCK9", "B0006GW2JU", "B00008K7AO", "B00320J6WS", "B000PAAJZ6", "B00AQBDU4Q", "B00000IC7G", "6305803765", "B0060ZJ7DA", "B00AEFXE9U", "B00GUO2SKA", "B0000BXMZ8", "B00F3L8P4E", "6305781095", "B00005JMW7", "B00000G02H", "B00G7QPXUI", "B00H9L26AA", "0783226845", "B00G4Q3KOC", "0679745580", "B0009W5IMO", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00GMV8M2Y", "1439187509", "B000ERVJQ8", "B00H7LJ2UO", "B000HRMAPE", "B00AQTY3JO", "B001QUF3SW", "B0060ZJ7BC", "140009691X", "B00H83EUQW", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B000A7DVR2", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B000E1NXJ0", "0671228110", "B00007AJF8", "B00005JLRE", "B008220DIC", "B00GPWEPZ8", "B00067AVKQ", "B00D2CYU2W", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00G15MDI0", "6305781052", "B008JFUNKU", "B00EV4EUT8", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00BEIYKM6", "B00AEFY8MM", "B00GST8U4U", "B003UESJH4", "B00009W5CA", "B004SIP8ZM", "B006OFN0SE", "B00BTYRB58", "B00080ZG10", "0812978919", "0679745645", "B00005JLKN", "B004UXUX4Q", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B00AZNEW5G", "B00121QGPY", "B000087F7Q", "B0047T74CM", "B0034G4P30", "B004SIP6VI", "0800141806", "B004U7MR1Y", "B00HOGBXS6", "B004SIP6QI", "B004FQX59I", "B006FE83UE", "B00HF98SPS", "B00D3LA5WG", "B004SIP98S", "B0062CU564", "B00005JMJG", "6304712936", "B00H9HZITU", "B0073U2EWM", "B004FQX5B6", "B00AHTYI5M", "B00DL48BM6", "B00G7QPUII"], "bought_together": ["B004SIP71M", "B0014GI6I2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008220DGE", "B004SIP71M", "B000M341SC", "B0013XZ2QK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15437}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.95, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000E33VWW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/418QYZP0NTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Capote"}

{"description": "It seems no one has ever had an unkind word forYellow Sky, yet somehow this handsome, hard-edged, and very well-made late-'40s Western remains little-known.  That may change with its release on a DVD so crisp and luminous, one wants to swear off Technicolor and luxuriate in the frosty glow of its highlights, the velvet blackness of its shadows, and the electric silver-gray of its desert skies.Story's pretty good, too.  Seven men led by Gregory Peck ride into a small Southwest town, wet their whistles at the saloon, then hold up the bank with a minimum of fuss.  Escaping should be a cinch, except for a troop of cavalry who reduce their number to six and watch the survivors ride off into a desert they probably won't live to cross.  Unexpected salvation looms in the form of Yellow Sky, a ghost town where the bandits find water, an old man (James Barton) and his tomboy granddaughter (Anne Baxter)--and the tempting rumor of gold.  That's when the real trouble starts.  The criminal partnership is severely strained by greed, several varieties of lust (for the girl as well as the treasure), the troublesome onset of conscience in some breasts and its total absence from others--notably Richard Widmark's.Yellow Skyre-teams director William A. Wellman and writer-producer Lamar Trotti, who five years earlier had madeThe Ox-Bow Incident, an authentic but rather pretentious Western classic.Yellow Sky's opening scene is all but lifted fromOx-Bow(along with two character actors), but this time around, Wellman eschews self-importance and just concentrates on spinning a gritty yarn (from a novel by W.R. Burnett).  Apart from sequences shot in Death Valley, the principal location is Yellow Sky itself, a grand ruin set against the timeless backdrop of the Alabama Hills.  And oh yes, the man responsible for those awesome whites, blacks, and silver-grays is Joe MacDonald, the cinematographer ofMy Darling Clementine.--Richard T.

{"description": "The legend of Pocahontas and John Smith receives a luminous and essential retelling by maverick filmmaker Terrence Malick. The facts of Virginia's first white settlers, circa 1607, have been told for eons and fortified by Disney's animated films: explorer Smith (Colin Farrell) and the Native American princess (newcomer Q'orianka Kilcher) bond when the two cultures meet, a flashpoint of curiosity and war lapping interchangeably at the shores of the new continent. Malick, who took a twenty year break between his second and third films (Days of Heaven and The Thin Red Line), is a master of film poetry; the film washes over you, with minimal dialogue (you see characters speak on camera for less than a quarter of the film). The rest of the words are a stream-of-consciousness narration--a technique Malick has used before but never to such degree, creating a movie you feel more than watch. The film's beauty (shot in Virginia by Emmanuel Lubezki) and production design (by Jack Fisk) seems very organic, and in fact, organic is a great label for the movie as a whole, from the dreadful conditions of early Jamestown (it makes you wonder why Englishman would want to live there) to the luminescent love story. Malick is blessed with a cast that includes Wes Studi, August Schellenberg, Christopher Plummer, and Christian Bale (who, curiously, was also in the Disney production). Fourteen-year-old Kilcher, the soul of the film, is an amazing find, and Farrell, so often tagged as the next big thing, delivers his first exceptional performance since his stunning debut in Tigerland. James Horner provides a fine score, but is overshadowed by a Mozart concerto and a recurring prelude from Wagner's Das Rheingold, a scrumptious weaving of horns fit to fuel the gentle intoxication of this film. Note: the film was initially 150 minutes, and then trimmed to 135 by Malick before the regular theatrical run. It was also the first film shot in 65mm since Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet. --Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000NOKFHQ", "B000VMIILU", "B000TXNDV6", "B00005PJ8T", "1573623903", "B000UVV24M", "B005LLX582", "B000MGB6NM", "B005KQVE1S", "B000FIHN5M", "B00CX7OW1G", "B003M987QK", "B0012Q732O", "B00003CXBH", "B0009PW4EQ", "B0002Y4PPK", "B005HV6Y5W", "B003LL3FIY", "B00J11U54K", "B004UOHNIY", "B000VKL6ZM", "B00KHWSB5M", "B0001I55YW", "B002O3Z50Q", "B00005QW6V", "0783231202", "B00004XPPG", "B00003CXAF", "B000ARXF8W", "B001MZ5W3M", "B003EYVXRS", "B00406UK7S", "B000A2WP7O", "B00I6JODGO", "B004AOECXI", "B000AARKOO", "B000J4QWMC", "B002GHHHHO", "B0018BD9DA", "B004C45AZU", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B0013D8LC2", "B003EYVXXW", "B0007UDC80", "B000R9U3B0", "B007PXYWNQ", "B0032LV4LS", "B003Y5H5FG", "B00019330O", "B0000TANUI", "B000UJ48SQ", "B00007GZYC", "B000F7CMRM", "B00005JKTP", "B0002YLCG0", "B004P2VQZC", "B002O3Z510", "B006ISJQ26", "B009AMAJPA", "B00009MEKN", "B007WZTMCI", "B003L20IG0", "B000CEV3P0", "B0002DRDBY", "B000ZOXDFA", "B000ASDFF4", "B00AEBB89W", "B00AEFXVCU", "B008220C38", "B00005JLX2", "B007REV4LQ", "B009INAI02", "B000XR9L50", "B005LAII3A", "B00005OSJN", "B002DHACT2", "B00BB67UNW", "B008JFUNKU", "B00005R23V", "B00140PK82", "B00005221M", "B000087F0X", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B004EPYZT4", "B003UYUQZW", "B00AEFY5B6", "B004CQZFH6", "B002ZG977Y", "0800177967", "B001L57ZZG", "B00DL48BM6", "B001JIE7JC", "B003Y7F1OG", "B000N3SU92", "B000NIVJF4", "B001KO1BCQ", "B005J7K9BO", "B000LC55F2", "B0045HCJ9O"], "bought_together": ["B000NOKFHQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000NOKFHQ", "B00005PJ8T", "B005LLX582", "B000VMIILU"]}, "price": 10.08, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 386879}, "asin": "B000EOTTTU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519FGGE3C5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The New World"}

{"description": "Reese (Zooey Deschanel,All the Real Girls) is a brusk barmaid/actress, toiling away in the East Village fringe circuit. Her father is reclusive J.D. Salinger-like author Don Holdin (Ed Harris,A History of Violence). Reese hasn't seen him for years. One night after a performance, an editor from a major publishing house (Amy Madigan,Carniv&#xE0;le), offers $100,000 for the letters he and her late mother exchanged during their courtship. Reese turns her down flat. Eventually, she changes her mind and takes off for rural Michigan to retrieve them. She finds the disheveled, hard-drinking Don living with former student Shelly (Amelia Warner,Quills) and ex-Christian rocker Corbit (a disarmingly straight-faced Will Ferrell). It's a bizarre, if functional arrangement: Shelly cooks the meals, while Corbit serves as security guard. All try to make nice, but the coke-snorting, insult-flinging Reese won't have any of it. She just wants to find the letters and go. This turns out to be trickier than expected, especially once she actually sits down to read them. Directed by and adapted from his two-act play, Adam Rapp'sWinter Passingis the kind of well-intentioned independent where longstanding family issues are solved in just a few days (to the gentle strains of Cat Power and the Shins).

{"description": "With its fantastic comedy seriesWeeds, cable network Showtime finally gave up its also-ran status to HBO and found itself with a controversial, buzz-worthy show that was as hilarious as it was dark, one about atrulydesperate housewife. A recent widow with two growing sons, Nancy Botwin (Golden Globe winner Mary-Louise Parker) looks like a typical resident of the affluent Southern California suburb of Agrestic. She keeps a clean, upscale house (with the help of a live-in maid), attends PTA meetings, goes to her kids' soccer games, makes frequent stops at the local coffee franchise.... and sells marijuana in order to make it all possible. Left with no way to support herself after her beloved husband's fatal heart attack, Nancy turns herself into the \"suburban baroness of bud,\" dealing to her neighbors in the area, with the help of her supplier Heylia (Tonye Patano) and point man Conrad (Romany Malco). Nancy's clients run from the local councilman (Kevin Nealon) to the just-barely-legal students at the local community college, but many in Agrestic are still in the dark as to how she keeps her family afloat, including her best friend, the sardonic Celia (Elizabeth Perkins), a wife and mother whose blistering, withering put-downs could make Dorothy Parker cringe in fear. But like many small-business owners, Nancy yearns for more success and cash, and like her workaholic neighbors, finds keeping a balance between work life and home life to be extremely precarious at best.WhileDesperate Housewivesyearned to be a suburban satire with bite,Weedswas the real deal, skewering upper-middle class mores with a sharp eye, a keen wit, and a mostly forgiving heart. In episode after episode, the show's creative team (led by creator Jenji Kohan) pulled back the layers of Agrestic's superficiality to show what lies beneath the squeaky-clean exteriors and smiling faces; it turns out that hunger, fear, desire, and, yes, desperation aren't that far down. However,Weedsforsakes pulpiness and florid drama for biting yet affectionate humor--its heroine is a woman with sliding morals, but one you'll root for to the very end. The effervescent Parker, the only actress who can mix perkiness with morbidity in just the right amounts, anchored the show with her amazing turn as Nancy, who by the end of the first season had become a kind of soccer-mom version of Michael Corleone, entering a corrupt world with both trepidation and fascination--and totally enamored of the power it brought her. Also perfectly cast, Perkins found the role of a lifetime as the bitterly hilarious Celia, and entering the show in its fourth episode, Justin Kirk (Parker's co-star inAngels in America) proved to be a potent secret weapon as Nancy's brother-in-law Andy, a slacker who wasn't above peddling t-shirts to elementary school kids. As icky as these characters might appear on the surface,Weedsmade them all immensely appealing and great company to be around. Don't say we didn't warn you: one hit and you'll be hooked on this show. The DVDs feature six episode commentaries with cast and crew, outtakes, original featurettes, a music video, and most enjoyably, Agrestic Herbal Recipes (for entertainment value only, we assume) and the \"Smoke and Mirrors\" marijuana mockumentary.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000Q6GUKW", "B00166UFSY", "B001AQBGM4", "B002AMVED8", "B003L77GTC", "B004YM6JSW", "B009TE9GNK", "B001OQCVFG", "B002ZCY8CC", "B002AMVEDI", "B003L77GS8", "B00HW3EXCE", "B001DJLCRC", "B000Q6GUW0", "B003L77GTM", "B009TE9HAW", "B0013ZGN9I", "B0032UYFA6", "B0029O0ANW", "B001RTSPVY", "B0015ABRE2", "B000V86OKG", "B0041KKZKA", "B002N5N5M0", "B00GWJIDFW", "B004YM6JUA", "B003L77GRO", "B0058YPG1G", "B005FISBTO", "B00EEDNR9A", "B002S913G6", "B00J5LXT44", "B0090XPH06", "B00079FUI6", "B00BUYWJEA", "B000Q6GUKC", "B0060MYKYY", "B00DXP7L88", "B009TE9GZI", "B000YABIQ6", "B0007QS324", "B00915G6WQ", "B001FB4W0W", "B003L77GPG", "B003R4ZMS6", "B000EXDS7K", "B000GH3CWK", "B005SEDI5M", "B0038M2APA", "B0092Q82LC", "B00511N7B2", "B001AQR39O", "B001AQBLBU", "B0009IW88K", "B0001KL5DA", "B005LAJ1JA", "B003FSTN7K", "B000A9QKRI", "B00003CXOP", "B0001O3YLM", "B0024FAR5M", "B007PTCP7K", "B00KPP6R9S", "B00005JNOG", "B0058YPO9A", "B00JVQ7PWU", "B0007R4SWM", "B00ELKDD9U", "B004HW7JNS", "B000FUTVLO", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B0002MPQRS", "B000RW3VDE", "B0018RKEQE", "B00280LZAE", "B00C1LIZMQ", "B0024F08RO", "B000FKO3GW", "B0009VBTP0", "B0018CWEYY", "B003UD7J6W", "B0002PYS7Y", "B002N5N5QQ", "B000F1IQI2", "B001GCUER0", "B000T9OP7G", "B009NH6AOQ", "B000WTVZI0", "B000N3T0EG", "B00K8HAKAK", "B000RO6JY0", "B0049P1VHS", "B009DA74O8", "B000FIMG4U", "B000E3L7F0", "B000P6YNTI", "B0024FAR4I", "B0032JTV6A", "B00ECGHM5O", "B0079IEPHA"], "bought_together": ["B000Q6GUKW", "B00166UFSY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00ELKDD9U", "B00HW3EXCE", "B004YM6JSW", "B003L77GTC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9736}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 8.98, "brand": "Lions Gate", "asin": "B000FFJYE8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Iy4dQgWzL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Weeds: Season 1"}

{"description": "The second season ofVeronica Marsshowcases the series' crackling-sharp writing and topnotch acting of star Kristen Bell and the rest of the cast. Veronica still struggles with the class wars in sunny Neptune, Calif., trying to find a balance between high school, love, helping her dad as a private eye, and doing the right thing. The ongoing thread of season 2 is the aftermath of a horrifying tragedy, and as Veronica and dad Keith try to find out what caused it, mysteries only compound. Shifty Sheriff Lamb, town powerbrokers, and various high-school cliques seem to undermine Veronica at every turn. Thankfully, Veronica has more chutzpah than Phillip Marlowe, and the side-of-the-mouth one-liners to match: \"Well, actually,\" Veronica says dryly to a bad guy, \"despite popular opinion, you reallycan'tbeat the truth out of someone.\" Some of the show's broad strokes echo the stellarBuffy the Vampire Slayer, yet Bell's Veronica doesn't need the supernatural to tackle a challenge. She's a real girl, conflicted, prickly, lovesick, yearning, sometimes even scared. As Veronica tries to solve the mystery, she must also handle her own heartbreaks, and the moral stumbles of those closest to her. Happily, she's got a great best pal, Wallace (the effervescent Percy Daggs III), and possibly the coolest, most understanding TV dad ever (Enrico Colantoni). The boxed set includes 22 episodes (many with deleted scenes), a behind-the-scenes mini-doc, a cute gag reel, and a short profile film,Veronica Mars: Not Your Average Teen Detective. You can say that again.--A.T.

{"description": "Put A Tooth Under Your Pillow And Let The Bloodbath Begin  Northern California, 1949: In the woods outside of a small town, a hideous witch lured children to her crumbling home where she stole their teeth, butchered their bodies, and cursed their souls to wander the earth forever. Decades later the house has been converted into a quaint country inn, but an untold evil remains: The witch&#x92;s slumber has been disturbed, and her vengeful spirit seeks the violent slaughter of all who stay there. And for one eleven-year-old girl with a loose molar and an active imagination, the ultimate horror begins with a visit from THE TOOTH FAIRY. Chandra West (WHITE NOISE), Lochlyn Munro (FREDDY VS.

{"description": "Forget any off-screen impressions you may have of Mel Gibson, and experience Apocalypto as the mad, bloody runaway train that it is. The story is set in the pre-Columbian Maya population: one village is brutally overrun, its residents either slaughtered or abducted, by a ruling tribe that needs slaves and human sacrifices. We focus on the capable warrior Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), although Gibson skillfully sketches a whole population of characters--many of whom don't survive the early reels. Most of the film is set in the dense jungle, but the middle section, in a grand Mayan city, is a dazzling triumph of design, costuming, and sheer decadent terror. The movie itself is a triumph of brutality, as Gibson lets loose his well-established fascination with bodily mortification in a litany of assaults including impalement, evisceration, snakebite, and bee stings. It's a dark, disgusted vision, but Gibson doesn't forget to apply some very canny moviemaking instincts to the violence--including the creation of a tremendous pair of villains (strikingly played by Raoul Trujillo and Rodolfo Palacias). The film is in a Maya dialect, subtitled in English, and shot on digital video (which occasionally betrays itself in some blurry quick pans). Amidst all the mayhem, nothing in the film is more devastating than a final wordless exchange of looks between captured villager Blunted (Jonathan Brewer) and his wife's mother (Maria Isabel Diaz), a superb change in tone from their early relationship. Yes, this is an obsessive, crazed movie, but Gibson knows what he's doing. --Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000UVV24M", "B0012Q732O", "B00003CXAF", "B001BNFRB2", "B000VMIILU", "1573623903", "B002O3Z50Q", "B00004XPPG", "6305692688", "B00028HBKM", "B00004RJ71", "B00AEFXKUI", "B002ZG999U", "B0002YLCG0", "B000VKL6ZM", "B002T9H2LA", "B0000542C6", "B0001CNQX0", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00006ADD5", "B00406UK7S", "B004AOECXI", "B004SIP8W0", "B000R9U3B0", "B00008G8LY", "B00001ZWUS", "B000MGB6NM", "B003EYVXXW", "6304711905", "B004HO6HWA", "B000QXDED6", "B0034G4P58", "B0000714BS", "B000XR9L50", "B00005JLQT", "0783230389", "B002VWNIEA", "B00AZNEW5G", "B008MIMWQW", "B003VA3JZY", "B0002DRDIW", "B000AARKOO", "B00BEJL6JK", "B004SIP7TE", "079283366X", "B00005V9HH", "B000M341QE", "B003HKN52U", "B005IUIXCE", "B00275EGWY", "B003UYUQZW", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002O3Z510", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B002WY65VU", "B000I0RNWU", "B00003CXWV", "B002XMGGK6", "B003NF97NK", "B000QXDCJ2", "B001FB5634", "B001DZOC6Y", "B007STBUHI", "B0000VCZMK", "B0013FDM7E", "B00015YVDG", "B003IY498Y", "6305433925", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005K3NR", "B000O76ZQC", "B003ELKNH2", "B00018D3ZA", "6304821832", "B00AEBBA36", "B009YQJ322", "B00005JL3T", "079284646X", "B002CA68MU", "B00BTYJYR6", "B00AEFYE08", "B000P0J09C", "B005LAIHPE", "B00441GZ1Y", "B001OQCV2E", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000BITV9W", "B004LWZW4M", "B005LAIIRQ", "B00003CXBH", "B000A2WP7O", "B001GCUO0W", "B00005JPD0", "B00AMSLDTM", "B000RTB0R6", "B00005JA8B", "B00009PY4G", "0783226039", "B000B8QG22", "B000069I1I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001BNFRB2", "B00028HBKM", "B00001ZWUS", "B00004XPPG"]}, "price": 10.55, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 53938}, "asin": "B000GNOKQG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41yXQu76-NL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Apocalypto (2006) (2007) Rudy Youngblood; Raoul Trujillo; Mel Gibson"}

{"description": "Stargate SG-1soldiers on with this five-disc, 20-episode set from the sturdy franchise's ninth season (2005-06), incorporating numerous changes while continuing to distinguish itself as one of the television's best sci-fi shows. Longtime star Richard Dean Anderson makes only brief cameos these days, after seven seasons as Lieutenant Colonel and one as Brigadier General Jack O'Neill. Stalwarts Amanda Tapping, Christopher Judge, and Michael Shanks (as Samantha Carter, Teal'c, and Daniel Jackson, respectively), are still on hand, but with Season 9, Ben Browder (known to many genre fans for his lead role in the excellentFarscapeseries) takes over as leader of SG-1, the Stargate project's ace team in the field. As Lt. Col. Cameron Mitchell, Browder effectively projects the same kind of cocky irreverence that was Anderson's trademark, but he has a ways to go before he fully equals the latter's appeal. More engaging is fellowFarscapealum Claudia Black as Vala (Daniel Jackson's one-time love interest and a vixen, thief, and liar who becomes an integral part of the team during the several episodes in which she appears), while Beau Bridges is capable but uninspiring as Major General Hank Landry, who runs the show back on Earth.Then there are the bad guys. With longtime nemeses the Goa'uld having essentially been eliminated, we now have the Ori, whose agenda of domination through religion provides the season's principal story arc. They're certainly a timely addition. With their \"Book of Origin,\" rejection of free will, and goal of subduing all heretics and \"unbelievers,\" the Ori resemble extreme fundamentalists of various stripes; on the other hand, when the U.S. military talks about crusades and \"ridding the galaxy of evildoers,\" parallels to the Bush administration's war on terror are obvious and unavoidable. Problem is, while we know that the Ori are relentless, devious, and bloated with the pride that always attaches itself to false gods, we can't actually see them. They have semi-human apostles, called Priors, who spread \"enlightenment\" and bad mojo (not to mention plagues of carnivorous bugs) all over the universe. They have mighty ships that that leave the good guys in dire straits in the climactic battle that ends the season (typically, little is resolved, leaving viewers to salivate for Season 10). But the Ori themselves are kin to the all-knowing Ancients, who exist not in recognizable physical form but as energy; unlike previous villains, from the Goa'uld to the Replicators toStargate Atlantis' Wraith, when it comes to the Ori, there's no there there. Meanwhile, the writers' replacement of the ancient Egyptian iconography used in earlier seasons with various aspects of Arthurian legend (Merlin, Knights of the Round Table, sword in the stone) is sometimes cool, sometimes merely hokey.As always,Stargate SG-1's production values and effects remain first-rate, even as the stories become more character-driven and less dependent on spectacular action sequences. The DVD transfers are excellent. Special features are similar to previous box sets: audio commentary on all episodes, featurettes focusing on sets, props, and special effects, and five \"directors series\" entries devoted to particular episodes.--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000PMFRTC", "6302020190", "B000F8O2PQ", "B000F8O2PG", "6303961614", "B000F8O2P6", "B000F8O2OW", "B000F8O2OM", "B000F8O2Q0", "B0010YSD7M", "B0017MO10U", "B000B8IA2G", "B000LC4ZI0", "B000RW3YYA", "B0017MO11O", "B00243FQFA", "B0029WLJHK", "B001MT7ZIS", "B004TJ1H3C", "B00402FGE4", "B002EL4RLQ", "B0000844I8", "B001MT7ZL0", "B004WJT5H4", "B00402FGEE", "B002KPINY8", "B0093LE30U", "B0006FO9B0", "B0093LE32S", "B0017XOF5A", "B0093LE33C", "B0093LE3BO", "B001BVRNPW", "B00242KD1S", "B0009299PG", "B002CLKP00", "B003L77GUG", "B002BAW6H2", "B0093LE3C8", "B0032JTUX4", "B002BAW6FE", "B002GP7ZVO", "B005PPMHWE", "B002GP7ZVY", "B00E688AZE", "B002BAW6GI", "B002ZCY872", "B0015LPS1Y", "B00GTZWZH6", "B008I34Z34", "B002BWP2IK", "B000AJJNFE", "B00BI6SRKK", "B004X60QWO", "B002BAW6FY", "B004QOB8TS", "B000WTZ6SK", "B003L77GWE", "B007USE5CE", "B005PPMHO2", "B00BD6K54G", "B004X60QE2", "B000BR9SA0", "B002BAW6GS", "B002DUJ9Q6", "B00GTZWXYQ", "B007AFC0W4", "B007USBGSA", "B002USF1UO", "B0049H6RWK", "B003L77G2Y", "B00F3L8P26", "B000ELL1QC", "B000BNI90Y", "B001C4CI8U", "B006SY8MYS", "B00B5ARKC0", "B004HYW84G", "B00E688720", "B00129W6LE", "B006LPHY6G", "B003XMKU0M", "B0053O8A46", "B001BN4WL8", "B0009W5J4Q", "B003XMKU3Y", "B003BV8I7C", "B001CQONMC", "B009LDCXQQ", "B000ERVJKE", "B002HRF68A", "B001RHGRTS", "B002PQ7JQA", "B003H9LIRK", "B000OCXNQW", "B0048FUUAI", "B003K2G0TA", "B004EXWGHY"], "bought_together": ["B000PMFRTC", "6302020190"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000F8O2PG", "B000F8O2PQ", "6303961614", "B000F8O2P6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 4159}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 17.69, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B000HEZEY6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511lDKwDXxL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Stargate SG-1: Season 9"}

{"description": "Long beforeAnimal Planetexisted, Walt Disney'sTrue-Life Adventuresawakened viewers to the wonders of the natural world.  Disney began the series in 1946 withSeal Island, and the six features and seven featurettes won eight Academy Awards.Listen to our interviewwith director emeritusRoy E. Disney.One winner wasBear Country(1953), which is included inCreatures of the Wild, along withThe African Lion(1955),Jungle Cat(1959) andThe Olympic Elk(1952). Each film traces the course of one year in the life of its subject. Lionesses hunt to feed their cubs (and their glorious but idle mates) on Serengeti Plains. A pair of jaguars in the Amazon and a mother bear in Yellowstone Park raise their cubs, teaching them to find food and avoid predators. Magnificent bull elk fight for mates in the high meadows of the Olympic Mountains.  Except for the narration occasionally seeming a little forced or obvious, these documentaries wear their age lightly. The prints have been lovingly restored: scratches and dirt have been removed; the color looks pristine. Artists and scientists will find useful reference material here, and children will enjoy the pageant of nature. Sadly, many of the ecological communities that seemed as inexhaustible as they were beautiful in the 1950's have been severely damaged during the intervening decades by human encroachment, poaching, and climate change.

{"description": "You probably don't think you need to see another remake ofLassie, but you do. Charles Sturridge's (Brideshead Revisited) film was criminally neglected in theaters but should gain a lofty status on home video as did remakes ofThe Secret Garden,A Little Princessand Sturridge's ownFairyTale: A True Story. It's a simple story of a dog who loves a boy so much she'll cross a country to reunite with him. Yes, you might need your handkerchief. No, not that much. Mom Sarah (Samantha Morton), dad Sam (John Lynch) and their son Joe (an adorable Jonathan Mason) live in an English coal town shortly before the Second World War. To put food on the table, Lassie is sold to The Duke of Rudling (Peter O'Toole, in fine form) for his granddaughter, Cilla (Hester Odgers). Soon the Duke and Lassie retire to Scotland, some 500 miles away, but neither distance, status, an angry kennel man, nor bumbling dog catchers will keep Lassie from Joe. Along the roads and hills of England (with Ireland scenery subbing in), Lassie touches many folks including a lovelorn lady (Kelly MacDonald), a scientist (Edward Fox), and most notably, a traveling performer (Peter Dinklage). Sturridge's deft touch allows the film to breathe with a great sense of physical comedy for the kids that never descends into pure shenanigans. There is just enough heart-tugging to go along with the scenic adventure. The cast is uniformly strong, with fine work from O'Toole, Morton, and Dinklage. Throw in beautiful scenery, cute dogs, Adrian Johnson's dramatic score, a cameo from the Loch Ness monster(!), and you have a winner; our pick for the best family film on DVD in 2006.

{"description": "Sean Penn gives another powerhouse performance inAll the King's Men, leading a topnotch cast in writer-director Steven Zaillian's underrated adaptation of thePulitzer prize-winning 1946 novelby Robert Penn Warren. When you consider that the previous1949 film versionearned well-deserved Academy Awards for director Robert Rossen and actors Broderick Crawford and Mercedes McCambridge, it's no surprise that Zaillian's film was expected to earn similar acclaim, but lukewarm critical reception and disappointing box-office gave it the stigma of a noble failure. And while the film (which moves Warren's story from the Depression-era '30s to the early 1950s) suffers from uneven pacing, partial miscasting, and an occasional lack of dramatic tension, it still qualifies as a first-class production that resonates with the timeless relevance of Warren's piercing political classic. Like Broderick before him, Penn is riveting as Louisiana governor Willie Stark, an upstart political dynamo (freely inspired by controversial real-life Louisiana governor Huey P. Long) whose rise to power is ultimately doomed by corruption and betrayal.Jude Law costars as political reporter Jack Burden, our firsthand witness to Stark's rise and inevitable fall; his orbit of political insiders includes a corrupt judge (Anthony Hopkins) with a dark secret to hide; a longtime friend (Mark Ruffalo) and former lover (Kate Winslet) who fall victim to Stark's influence; and political staffers (James Gandolfini, Patricia Clarkson) who remain powerless against Stark's ill-fated populist juggernaut. At Sean Penn's request, former child star Jackie Earle Haley (from the originalBad News Bears) makes a welcome return to movies as Willie Stark's quietly intense bodyguard, \"Sugar-Boy.\" Coproduced by Louisiana-born political consultant James Carville, filmed on authentic Louisiana locations and boasting all the stately, luxurious production values of a would-be Oscar contender,All the King's Menclearly benefits from Penn's fiery performance and Zaillian's earnest embrace of Warren's still-potent subject matter. And while the film's shortcomings may have prevented it from achieving unanimous acclaim, this is still a serious, well-crafted drama with much to say about the insidious potential for fascism in America, especially when well-meaning politicians lose their souls to power.--Jeff ShannonOn the DVDThe special features that accompanyAll the King's Menfurther demonstrate the film's in-production status as a potential classic. While the \"making of\" featurette is perfunctory at best, the other featurettes are definitely worthwhile despite Sean Penn's conspicuous absence. In \"Shake Hands with the Devil,\" the film's cast, producer, and writer-director Steven Zaillian discuss the timeless theme of political corruption; \"An American Classic\" is a concise profile of Robert Penn Warren, paying tribute to the poet and author's literary achievements; and \"The Legend and Lore of Huey Long\" examines the life and legacy of the still-beloved governor who won the hearts of working-class Louisianans while falling prey to his own ambition. \"LA Confidential\" is a brief featurette about the film's use of authentic Louisiana locations and the positive effect they had on cast and crew; three deleted scenes were obviously cut from the film for purposes of time, yet offer ample proof of Zaillian's established skill as one of Hollywood's top screenwriters; and the alternate ending extends beyond the film's final shot, with a funeral scene that serves as a melancholy (and ultimately unnecessary) coda to the film's Greek-tragic drama.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BITV92", "B000BITUHK", "0156012952", "B00000IQC0", "B0010DM3R4", "B004IFYMWK", "B000N6U0E2", "B0000DZTLW", "B00005JOC9", "B000N3SU92", "B002O5M4T4", "B006OFN0SE", "B001TH92N4", "B003ASLJQS", "B002DU39GW", "B008FYZI3M", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B001N44BVQ", "1582880816", "B005FITIGO", "B000CEXEWA", "B0000AM6JI", "B00013RC2U", "B0006210ZG", "6303477151", "B00003CXPV", "B00005JNQA", "B006GL8NQ0", "B0060ZJ7DA", "B004SUDQD6", "B004P7CMUU", "B00AEBB9AK", "B0000844LU", "B00121QGPY", "B004EPYZP8", "B002NO4ISG", "B000A2UBN4", "B0013XZ2QK", "B001UV4XRY", "B006QVRVJK", "0800141806", "B000P5FH3K", "B00005PJ8T", "B001U2M15O", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00BB67UNW", "B007CEFTSA", "B001QUF3SW", "B00DDY45DI", "B001UDS4BS", "B009AMANBA", "B00006FD9P", "B0001CNRRU", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00G7QPUII", "B00EV4EUT8", "B000M341SC", "0790736411", "B000OYAT3U", "B000BYA5G4", "B001BSBC16", "B0006IIPIK", "B00080ZG10", "B00AEBB8SS", "B005S9ELVC", "B00DHHWXYY", "B000059TFO", "B001PPLJIQ", "B000MXPE7O", "B0000DI87S", "B00GPWEPZ8", "0780626117", "6305767866", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B000NQRR1Q", "B00AEFXT1S", "B0073U2EWM", "B0031OCY2E", "B0016Q2D66", "B000HT386M", "B000BYY11Y", "630542828X", "0767810872", "B00275EGWY", "B0001EFV7C", "0783227973", "B00000K0DR", "B00AEFXBPM", "B0007R4SVI", "B00006JDU8", "B00003CXFV", "B0007TKNGK", "B00005JKQS", "B004SEUJXM", "B000VBB6F6", "B00441GYYC", "B00005JL78", "B004FQX59I"], "bought_together": ["B000BITV92"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BITV92", "B000V5WH7S", "B002DU39GW", "B000XJD34I"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 50686}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.81, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000K2UGXO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51drUj0iIKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "All the King's Men (Special Edition)"}

{"description": "An art-house film filled with more humor and skilled acting than most Hollywood blockbusters,Ten Canoesis a wry story within a story. The tone of the film is set when narrator David Gulpilil (Crocodile Dundee) says, \"Once upon a time in a land far, far away....\" He stops himself with a warm, hearty chuckle and adds, \"I'm only joking.\" Director Rolf de Heer does a fine job with his cast of novice actors, who depict a life most moviegoers are unfamiliar with. Set in Australia's far northern Arnhem Land, the film--which won the Special Jury Prize at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival--tells the tale of friendship, deception, and forbidden love. Ten tribesmen venture on a trip where they will build canoes, gather food, and gossip about their sexual prowess and their wives. During the trip, Minygululu (Peter Minygululu) regales his younger brother Dayindi (played by David Gulpilil's son, Jamie Gulpilil) with stories of a man who lusts after his older sibling's wife. It is giving nothing away to reveal that Dayindi has a crush on Minygululu's youngest bride. Handled differently, the film could've been saddled with the ick factor of siblings chasing after the same young woman. But the way de Heer presents it, it is a parable that distinguishes between right and wrong, in an entertaining and non-judgmental way. Cinematographer Ian Jones is to be commended for his amazing work. He frames the shots in a superb fashion and showcases the raw beauty of the land--and the people--that time has forgotten.--Jae-Ha Kim", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JLD4", "B000A7Q2KA", "B000EPFTY8", "B00393SG42", "B00006RG78", "B004326F50", "B001EAWMP6", "B0007UDC80", "B00005QAPI", "B0001I55Y2", "B003RHZ67K", "B0000A02Y4", "B00267OBBE", "B005HP2J66", "B000GIW9I2", "B00001ODHV", "B005EVJCOA", "B008LFYZAM", "B00D2UMHQ0", "B0000542C6", "B00BTYJYR6", "6305428417", "B00DEKKEPO", "B001DWNUD8", "B00G7QPYX4", "B003102JDM", "B00019330O", "B00005JKJA", "0780021134", "B00A1AU64E", "B005I0DV4Y", "B00003CXB5", "B004UOHNIY", "079284646X", "B000KX0IOA", "B003D3Y692", "186465032X", "0934971374"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JLD4", "B000A7Q2KA", "B00393SG42", "B00006RG78"]}, "price": 22.49, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 295320}, "asin": "B000K7VKX4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Dc5rc0gLL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ten Canoes"}

{"description": "Growing up can be a confusing journey fraught with difficult choices.  Boog (Martin Lawrence) is a domesticated Grizzly Bear who leads a perfectly happy life inside of Park Ranger Beth's (Debra Messing) garage, but a chance meeting with an overly energetic mule deer named Elliot (Ashton Kutcher) quickly changes everything and lands Boog high in the forest a few days before the opening of hunting season.  Devoid of even the most basic survival skills, Boog and Elliot stumble through the woods and find themselves at the mercy of every forest animal from skunks to chipmunks as well as an evil hunter named Shaw (Gary Sinise).  After unintentionally inciting and endangering an entire forest full of clever animals, Boog and Elliot come to the realization that only by banding together do the forest animals stand a chance of outsmarting the hunters and ensuring their own survival.This first animated film from Sony Pictures Animation takes its inspiration from cartoonist Steve Moore(In the Bleachers)and features animals with human-like intelligence, a vibrant color palate, and skilled animation that makes everything from the wind blowing Boo's fur to the animals' wild trip down the falls simply breathtaking.  While it doesn't quite live up toOver the Hedge,Open Seasonis an entertaining production that explores the difficult process of maturation, the universal need for acceptance, and the true value of friendship.  Special features include a 15-minute featurette about the animation process at Sony Pictures Animation and Image Works, a 7-minute look at the recording sessions featuring the voices behind the characters, two deleted scenes, three short animated cartoon strips, a short \"Boog and Elliot's Midnight Bun Run\" that's an extension of the trailer scene in the movie, art gallery, beat boards, humorous commentary from the animals' point of views, and a full length commentary by Producer Michelle Murdocca, Directors Roger Allers and Jill Culton, and others.  Activities include a \"Voice-A-Rama\" where viewers can hear specific lines spoken by alternate voices and a trivia \"Wheel of Fortune--Forest Edition\" as well as a DVD-ROM link to more online fun.

{"description": "Anyone who seeks out a Steven Seagal movie has certain expectations:  Bone-crunchingly brutal martial arts action; spiritual or ecological wisdom uttered in Seagal's hoarse monotone; and one long relentless scowl.Flight of Furyfails to deliver on all counts. Seagal plays an ex-military guy who's the only man who can retrieve a stolen stealth fighter. So he goes to Afghanistan, where he teams up with a sexy agent of some kind (Ciera Payton, making her cinematic debut) to shoot a bunch of Afghan mercenaries and fly away. The only plausible explanation for this movie's existence is that Seagal and his producers bought some stock footage of jet fighters and decided to build a story around it. The action scenes are murky, brief, and edited to compensate for Seagal's increasing bulk. The rote dialogue--co-written by Seagal--is recycled from a dozen other action movies. And Seagal can't even muster the energy to frown, let alone scowl. This inert lump of a movie is the latest in a series of clumsy, incompetent, straight-to-video clunkers from Seagal, who is cynically squeezing every dollar he can out of his long-suffering fanbase.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000F6IOCA", "B0030E5PWQ", "B001AR010Q", "B000A5043S", "B000VECACQ", "B000255LCK", "B004MLEYUU", "B00083FZEU", "B002G1WPIG", "B00007JZUP", "B004V4RT8C", "B0090EDEM8", "B0011VIO4Q", "B001MLZNKS", "B000E6ESD0", "B001VFM0YC", "B00005QAP6", "B000BRBA92", "B0006VL1IS", "B000006PAB", "B000QXDCLU", "6305428158", "B00009ZPTZ", "B0000844MD", "B000U1ZV6C", "B008XAT0SW", "B0050MB5NO", "B00FEHCPZ2", "B002WSZSNM", "B0045HCIWW", "B004SEUJ1O", "B002ZG98C8", "0790740826", "0790729334", "B00003CXW4", "B0045HCJFS", "B003YXZHI0", "B001B3LIOC", "B00067BBRS", "B003Z94WBG", "B0090EDE1Y", "B0017XOF50", "B004USUP1C", "B0087OULG4", "B0045HCIWM", "B001VFM0YM", "6304712898", "B00A4TMLNG", "B00JU94ZPS", "B000E0WJLE", "B00BUAEYVK", "B0035G5IZI", "B00DSDUVFK", "B00E5SAJ5Y", "B0010YVCB6", "B008R52L3E", "B000ENUYH2", "B004MLEYU0", "B00596WEVI", "B00FEHCQNI", "B008NP4ZUU", "B00BUH1QHS", "B000HT38HQ", "B001B8T6C8", "B001M9ELQC", "B000N3T0E6", "B002GHHHME", "B0045O2PFU", "B00BLF9FOK", "B003G0E31I", "B00H1RMWYW", "B000ELL1Q2", "B006JN8798", "B0062P3392", "076780970X", "B000GW8U9U", "B00FRILRL6", "B000ENUYGS", "B003VQO4WU", "B007XTDXDW", "B00005N5QW", "B007IUEEBQ", "B00260HH2G", "B004499LTO", "B0038Z5SEM", "B000BTITKS", "B00441GYZG", "B000KLQUSU", "B000RL6GBO", "B004IFYMWK", "B0015XHP2C", "0767802497", "B007XF0XUW", "B0067EKYAY", "B00B04NIM2", "B002935GNC", "6304779178", "B00140PK82", "B00ARRQ9NI", "B00DU22OI6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0090EDEM8", "B000F6IOCA", "B0030E5PWQ", "B004MLEYUU"]}, "price": 17.15, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 177983}, "asin": "B000LPR6G0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51xw9g%2BmdLL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Flight of Fury"}

{"description": "\"Don't search for all the answers at once,\" says a giant appearing to FBI Agent Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) in a vision. \"A path is formed by laying one stone at a time.\" InTwin Peaks, that's easier said than done. Over the course of two seasons, that path went nowhere and everywhere. \"Bureau guidelines, deductive technique, Tibetan method, and luck\" don't cut it here. It also takes a little magic, which is what makes David Lynch and Mark Frost's bracingly original serial drama one of TV's ultimate trips, and still the stuff that fever dreams are made of. With the DVD release of season 2, die-hardPeakers can rekindle their obsession with this macabre, maddening, sinister, and surreal series set in the rural Pacific Northwest community whose bucolic surroundings hide \"things dark and heinous.\" (If you're new toTwin Peaks, best to get the lay of the land by watching the brilliant feature-length pilot and the instant-cult-classic first season, which captureTwinat its peak. Neither is widely available on DVD, however.) Three main mysteries drive season 2. First, there's the still (!) unresolved murder of Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee). Then, there's the question of who shot Cooper in the season 1 cliffhanger. And finally, ultimately: What about Bob? With its dream logic, bizarre behavior, and nightmare imagery, much of what transpires goes right by you. Some subplots (Sherilyn Fenn's sexpot Audrey held captive at the bordello, One-Eyed Jacks) are easier to latch on to than others (amnesiac Nadine believes she's an 18-year-old high schooler)  And, yes, that's a pre-X-FilesDavid Duchovny as Dennis/Denice, a transsexual DEA agent.InTwin Peaks' second season, the truth is out there, but we are enteringA Few Good Menterritory. When Laura's killer is at last revealed in episode 16, no doubt many will not be able to handle the truth. The teases, red herrings, and out-and-out gonzo looniness will try the patience of viewers with a more conventional bent. But, as Cooper observes at one point, \"All in all, [it's] a very interesting experience,\" with enough doppelgangers, allusions, pop-culture references, and in-jokes to keep bloggers buzzing. If, for example, you get any pleasure from recognizing Hank Worden, who played Mose inThe Searchers, as \"the world's most decrepit room service waiter,\" thenTwin Peaksmay just make you feel right at home.--Donald LiebensonBeyondTwin PeaksEssential DVDs by Director David LynchThe SoundtrackTwin Peaks: Fire Walk with MeStills fromTwin Peaks: The Second Season(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKES", "B000056BP1", "B00005V54S", "1451662076", "B000063JDE", "B000002MF9", "061596883X", "6302814596", "B000QQFKYE", "B00005JKJA", "B001152TL6", "B000002LMM", "B000UX6THK", "B000BOH986", "B00KCTG4PO", "B005HT400A", "B001FOK70S", "B00000F3CD", "B000NY1E8U", "B000W4HFY8", "B000069I09", "B000BOH990", "B000BOH98G", "B0007PALZ2", "B000002LH4", "B00GOC74QG", "B00AEFXV3E", "B00005Y4RY", "B00062IVM6", "B008CYDD7I", "B0007UC8Y4", "B003BWQE0E", "B000CNE0SS", "6305972761", "B00BXKPYHK", "B001CIOCJ4", "B00INLE5K4", "B0007GAG42", "B001GCUBS2", "B007F5S1GS", "0671744003", "B001L1S1SK", "B00BTYPW7C", "B006TTC5MM", "B000063K2Q", "B002VWNICC", "B0000CDUT5", "B0058JEHTS", "B00000F4MA", "B00061QJ8A", "B000FIMG68", "0767821408", "B00005JPP2", "B00GYG8BKK", "B0064NTZKI", "B0050FXDDQ", "B00CPEK3OM", "B0018CWEXA", "B00006CXGZ", "B006ZL1P66", "B001FB4VZ8", "B00000G02H", "B000UGBOT0", "B001A7GOCA", "B0045HCJSU", "B0007YMWFK", "B00005JNOG", "B0002WZRSG", "B00000C0QO", "B006MFQ4OS", "B002LITH76", "B001AZIRZ4", "B000E5N6B6", "B0053TWW9K", "B00005JPII", "B0058JEHSO", "B00005JLRE", "B000ERVJKE", "B003F3NDOE", "B000YENUI6", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B008PJZDXW", "B000GETTKM", "B0009VBTP0", "B00CWIMVDW", "B0001MZ7K0", "B000A0GP2W", "B00C6F61S2", "B00EEDNR9A", "B0038M2AOG", "B001MYIXAC", "B00C5SE8F8", "B000B8384Q", "B005KQVE1S", "B00007L4I6", "B0008KLV96", "B003L77GWE", "B00005JMUA", "B0026RHR6U", "B0051T47NQ"], "bought_together": ["B000056BP1"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000UX6THK", "B000056BP1", "B00005JKES", "B00KCTG4PO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30504}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "Paramount Pictures", "asin": "B000M3439E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G-FGoYcGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Twin Peaks: Season 2"}
{"description": "Thematically ambitious and emotionally complex, Clint Eastwood'sFlags of Our Fathersis an intimate epic with much to say about war and the nature of heroism in America. Based on thenon-fiction bestsellerby James Bradley (with Ron Powers), and adapted byMillion Dollar Babyscreenwriter Paul Haggis (Jarheadscreenwriter William Broyles Jr. wrote an earlier draft that was abandoned when Eastwood signed on to direct), this isn't so much a conventional war movie as it is a thought-provoking meditation on our collective need for heroes, even at the expense of those we deem heroic. In telling the story of the six men (five Marines, one Navy medic) who raised the American flag of victory on the battle-ravaged Japanese island of Iwo Jima on February 23rd, 1945, Eastwood takes us deep into the horror of war (in painstakingly authentic Iwo Jima battle scenes) while emphasizing how three of the surviving flag-raisers (played by Adam Beach, Ryan Phillippe, and Jesse Bradford) became reluctant celebrities &#x96; and resentful pawns in a wartime publicity campaign &#x96; after their flag-raising was immortalized by Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal in the most famous photograph in military history.As the surviving flag-raisers reluctantly play their public roles as \"the heroes of Iwo Jima\" during an exhausting (but clearly necessary) wartime bond rally tour,Flags of Our Fathersevolves into a pointed study of battlefield valor and misplaced idolatry, incorporating subtle comment on the bogus nature of celebrity, the trauma of battle, and the true meaning of heroism in wartime. Wisely avoiding any direct parallels to contemporary history, Eastwood allows us to draw our own conclusions about the Iwo Jima flag-raisers and how their postwar histories (both noble and tragic) simultaneously illustrate the hazards of exploited celebrity and society's genuine need for admirable role models during times of national crisis.Flags of Our Fathersdefies the expectations of those seeking a more straightforward war-action drama, but it's richly satisfying, impeccably crafted film that manages to be genuinely patriotic (in celebrating the camaraderie of soldiers in battle) while dramatizing the ultimate futility of war. Eastwood's follow-up film,Letters from Iwo Jima, examines the Iwo Jima conflict from the Japanese perspective.--Jeff ShannonBeyondFlags of Our FathersOther World War II DVDsEssential DVDs by Director Clint EastwoodFlags of Our Fathersby James BradleyStills fromFlags of Our Fathers(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JPKE", "B00555ZTRY", "B000SK5Z2A", "B00AEBBA36", "B000AAF27G", "B001DSNEJM", "B00D3LA63Y", "B001IBIHQ4", "B00AEBB8QK", "B00001ZWUS", "B000F5WR4W", "B00AEBB9UU", "B00004X13T", "B00005JK8K", "B00005PJ8T", "B00C2R11Y8", "B0021L8V2A", "B004U7MQWY", "B0002WT4OE", "B000009RBL", "B00979KQD6", "B00HF98SHG", "B0015D20FE", "B000F4PDF8", "B004SIP9X8", "B00006CXSS", "B00003CXTG", "B004GJYRA0", "B003AT9D74", "0553384155", "B0071HPP3M", "B000065U1N", "B00AEFXVCU", "0553111337", "B0002V7ON8", "0792839730", "B000095WW8", "B003ASLJOU", "B001LXIDWM", "B000NTPG7A", "B0002ISG9W", "B000LAZE8C", "B000P0J09C", "B000EHSVS2", "B00005PJ8S", "B00B0U2SFE", "B008XJ0J8I", "B00275EGWY", "B000DZIGDU", "B00K2CHX9C", "B00005JKTP", "0440229200", "B00AEFXRRO", "B00AEBB86U", "B000EHSVSC", "B005LAIGYQ", "B0007TKNM4", "B0007TKNGA", "B00004XPPG", "B003ASLJO0", "B00003CXHJ", "B001TUZG4K", "B001FB55L2", "B005GYSV4M", "B00AEFXVOI", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AZNEW5G", "B00L4K450G", "B00096S4B2", "B00008K76U", "B003ELKNH2", "B003ASLJMW", "B00005JA9F", "B00004XPPC", "B00BL9MOPS", "B000FJGWBC", "B00HEPE6MM", "0767802470", "B000FVQLRA", "B002T9H2LA", "B00005N5S3", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002O3Z510", "B00005OSJQ", "B005LAIGN2", "B003AWRMA6", "B000P0J0EW", "B002O3Z4WU", "B00J11U54K", "079284646X", "B000ELL1R6", "B007S0DCUU", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B00DL48BM6", "B00096S4BM", "0792841409", "B003ASLJPE", "B0007TKNLA", "0792838408", "B00AEFYENK"], "bought_together": ["B00005JPKE", "B00AEBBA36"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00001ZWUS", "B00006CXSS", "B00005JPKE", "B000P1XITE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 11870}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.88, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B000M4RG42", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51w01CgEgRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Flags of Our Fathers (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Brilliantly conceived, superbly directed, and beautifully acted,Babelis inarguably one of the best films of 2006. Director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and his co-writer, Guillermo Arriaga (the two also collaborated onAmores Perrosand21 Grams) weave together the disparate strands of their story into a finely hewn fabric by focusing on what appear to be several equally incongruent characters: an American (Brad Pitt) touring Morocco with his wife (Cate Blanchett) become the focus of an international incident also involving a hardscrabble Moroccan farmer (Mustapha Rachidi) struggling to keep his two young sons in line and his family together. A San Diego nanny (Adriana Barraza), her employers absent, makes the disastrous decision to take their kids with her to a wedding in Mexico. And a deaf-mute Japanese teen (the extraordinary Rinko Kikuchi) deals with a relationship with her father (Koji Yakusho) and the world in general that's been upended by the death of her mother. It is perhaps not surprising, or particularly original, that a gun is the device that ties these people together. YetBabelisn't merely about violence and its tragic consequences. It's about communication, and especially the lack of it--both intercultural, raising issues like terrorism and immigration, and intracultural, as basic as husbands talking to their wives and parents understanding their children. I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's command of his medium, sound and visual alike, is extraordinary; the camera work is by turns kinetic and restrained, the music always well matched to the scenes, the editing deft but not confusing, and the film (which clocks in at a lengthy 143 minutes) is filled with indelible moments. Many of those moments are also pretty stark and grim, and no will claim that all of this leads to a \"happy\" ending, but there is a sense of reconciliation, perhaps even resolution. \"If You Want to be Understood... Listen,\" goes the tagline. And if you want a movie that will leave you thinking,Babelis it.--Sam GrahamBeyondBabelOther Interweaving Storylines on DVDOther DVDs by Director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rrituWhy We Love Cate BlanchettStills fromBabel(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001CNRRU", "B00005N8A9", "B0041KKYF6", "B000A3XY5A", "B000F7CMRM", "B000067IZ3", "B00005JL57", "B00AEFXESQ", "B001P9KR8U", "B000N6TX1I", "B001JIE7JC", "B00005JPKE", "B00AEFXQ9S", "B00005JMJ4", "B0010DR4BO", "B000NIVJF4", "B000NIVJFY", "B000F1IQN2", "B00HF98SPS", "B0045ZAQRS", "B00011CZRE", "B000N3T0DW", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B000MZHW40", "B004SIP6VI", "B0034G4P30", "B008JFUNKU", "B003ASLJQS", "B000E1NXJ0", "B004SIP6GI", "B00AEBB89W", "B00275EGWY", "B000IONJM4", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00003CWTI", "B00080Z53O", "B00005JNCZ", "B00114XTHA", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00112S8RS", "B001PPLJIQ", "B000MXPE7O", "B00102F5WK", "B00121QGPY", "B0016Q2D66", "B002J1RZHE", "B008220DGE", "B000O76ZQC", "B0013XZ6X4", "B00080ZG10", "B00337KM2S", "B000286RP2", "B004SIP8ZM", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005JMJG", "B00005Q4CS", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B0036TGSJE", "B001TOD92C", "B000OY8NBK", "B004XVMCKS", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B00005JLRE", "B00005JH9M", "B00004WG2F", "B00AEBB8SS", "B00005JKJA", "B00H9HZITU", "B000YENUI6", "B0041KKYDI", "B001MZ5W3M", "B000N3SU92", "B000EQHXNW", "B0041KKYEM", "B001LLH8SE", "B0007TKOAA", "B000P0J0BK", "B002S5N052", "B004SIP7S0", "B00AEBB8NI", "B002SJIO4A", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B000E33VWW", "B000M341QE", "B002VWNICC", "B001NFNFNU", "6305313687", "B00005JKTF", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B00008K7AO", "B00DL48BM6", "079073639X", "B00H83EUQW", "B000FVQLRA", "B0002TT0MI", "B00AHTYI5M", "B00H9L26AA", "B00003CWRX", "B002FHGESI"], "bought_together": ["B00005N8A9", "B0041KKYF6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000A3XY5A", "B0001CNRRU", "B0041KKYF6", "B00G4Q3KOC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 100262}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.22, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B000MCH5P4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51poif023LL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Babel"}
{"description": "Based on the WWI adventure novelBrown on Resolutionby C.S. Forester,Sailor of the Kingis an enjoyable British-made war drama buoyed by its energetic star, Jeffrey Hunter, and an exciting and suspenseful premise. The picture opens on a slow note with British Navy captain Michael Rennie ending a tryst with English girl Wendy Hiller; years later, the product of that union is British-Canadian sailor Jeffrey Hunter, whose ship is dispatched to intercept a powerful German warship by now-Admiral Rennie. The ensuing fight sinks Hunter's ship and damages the German boat, but Hunter evades capture and hunkers down on the island where the Nazi captain (Peter Van Eyck) has docked for repairs; there he wages a one-man assault against the ship using only a rifle and his own skills. Roy Boulting's direction is crisp and assured, and the cast, especially the underappreciated Hunter (in his first leading role), is uniformly fine, which should makeSailor of the Kinga worthwhile discovery for WWII action fans. The DVD includes two endings--the original British release, which adds to the Rennie-Hiller relationship, and the pat American conclusion.-- Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001FVDGE", "B000NTPG66", "B000EHSVVE", "B000EHSVVO", "B000MGBLIC", "B005HQBO9I", "B004176JJY", "B000NO1XJA", "B000H1RFQ4", "B000MGBLIW", "B00CHYSSME", "B000EMGJFE", "B004VGHF7K", "B00LG22EZA", "B00005PJ8K", "B00096S4BM", "B000EHSVUK", "B000063URX", "B000MGBLJQ", "B000MGBLJ6", "B0029778T8", "B000H1RFSM", "B004R6EFAO", "B0001NBMHQ", "B00005JN9P", "B000E5N6KW", "B004CZZZ3Q", "B004U7EIES", "B005HQBO9S", "B005MXQD4W", "B00008AOTO", "B008A1TWXC", "B00143XE0U", "B0015S2OWI", "B00096S4B2", "B00C2535TE", "B00HZOXRCC", "B000TLTCPO", "B000EHSVV4", "B004R6EF9U", "B00008AOTR", "B0000AMRUP", "B0001NBMGC", "B000066C6H", "B00005R23T", "B00008DDGW", "B0008ENHU8", "B007HCI42A", "B000MGBLIM", "B00KIZYDCI", "B005DIA0IQ", "B00KH53QY0", "B00005B1YF", "B000EHSVX2", "B00AEFXLKC", "B0009UVCQW", "B00KIZY3XW", "B00005JP3T", "B00D3XMA9A", "B004IFYMXO", "B002DNLT1Q", "B004LB5FB8", "B0001NBMI0", "B00005PJ8L", "B00441GYYC", "B005DTZXMI", "B00008R9M6", "B005OTGS4E", "B00D3XM7H0", "B003B3NV5E", "B004GSVXBW", "B000E0WJN2", "B00BY0EBK0", "B004IFYMXE", "B00KIZY8IW", "B007232B5K", "B000063URW", "B000NTPG6Q", "B00005OSJQ", "B0001WTWWE", "B000BPL2FG", "B0007ZEOQE", "B008F0QBB4", "B0005C9MQ6", "B007SVMWBE", "B00096S4DA", "B0082SIGR6", "0792841662", "B00005B1YH", "B000NO1XMC", "B0006B2A42", "B00EVIOVM0", "B00005QCVP", "B0001NBMH6", "B00CZ7ALDM", "B0007TKNDI", "B0046DBTC0", "B004X63SEM", "B00096S4BW", "B00CV1PG32"], "bought_together": ["B0001FVDGE", "B000NTPG66"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001FVDGE", "B000NTPG66", "B000EHSVVE", "B000H1RFSM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 88334}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.86, "brand": "20TH CENTURY FOX HOME ENTMNT", "asin": "B000MGBLJG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51O3UmxEgiL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sailor of the King"}
