{"description": "There's no getting around a simple, basic truth: watchingLawrence of Arabiain any home-video format represents a compromise. There's no better way to appreciate this epic biographical adventure than to see it projected in 70 millimeter onto a huge theater screen. That caveat aside, David Lean's masterful \"desert classic\" is still enjoyable on the small screen, especially if viewed in widescreen format. (If your only option is to view a \"pan & scan\" version, it's best not to bother; this is a film for which the widescreen format is utterly mandatory.) Peter O'Toole gives a star-making performance as T.E. Lawrence, the eccentric British officer who united the desert tribes of Arabia against the Turks during World War I. Lean orchestrates sweeping battle sequences and breathtaking action, but the film is really about the adventures and trials that transform Lawrence into a legendary man of the desert. Lean traces this transformation on a vast canvas of awesome physicality; no other movie has captured the expanse of the desert with such scope and grandeur. Equally important is the psychology of Lawrence, who remains an enigma even as we grasp his identification with the desert. Perhaps the greatest triumph of this landmark film is that Lean has conveyed the romance, danger, and allure of the desert with such physical and emotional power. It's a film about a man who leads one life but is irresistibly drawn to another, where his greatness and mystery are allowed to flourish in equal measure.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000040EJ", "6305123616", "0800132009", "6304151306", "6304071876", "6303168507", "0792839846", "630150528X", "6304196954", "630018224X", "B0000048ZL", "B000005PFL", "6300215539", "0792844645", "6302464889", "0780616456", "6300216721", "6300246965", "0783235593", "0792837630", "6301628454", "6302909023", "B000059HGY", "6302415853", "6301976622", "6305282927", "0790743213", "6303020089", "6300214060", "0783216084", "6305261296", "B00003CXE6", "6301662954", "B000003KHS", "0800179552", "B000056BRF", "079213690X", "630105573X", "B00000F6D1", "6300215814", "6300185095", "B00005Q4GY", "0792133153", "6301971809", "6301628667", "6303494390", "B00004TIUO", "6300214567", "6300214826", "6300181340", "6303402348", "B000EO7AIC", "B00005A1VH", "0783235607", "0790732017", "6303057225", "0800199421", "0790733927", "6304935811", "6301016289", "6303383300", "0790752395", "6302610702", "0783221347", "0790701251", "0783231482", "630018627X", "0790734079", "B000003KDG", "B00005OCPO", "0792836553", "B000062XM6", "0800125762", "0792108280", "6302800420", "B00005QATY", "6300181286", "5559477621", "6301208773", "6301888901", "B00005A7VC", "B00005LMA7", "1558807780", "B00007JME0", "B00000I1EM", "6304111398", "6300183513", "6303402070", "0792116887", "6303203337", "0790744589", "6300251012", "6302256615", "0792110463", "6300183084", "B000006GCU", "B00004RFFA", "630347327X", "6302023742", "079283853X"], "bought_together": ["B0000040EJ", "6305123616"], "also_viewed": ["6305123616", "B000054OW2", "6305363668", "B00BBND56G", "0782008348", "0792836510", "6304117752", "0783216084", "6303402070", "0792839846", "6302610702", "6304539258", "1558807780", "0792158261", "B0000040EJ", "6302909023"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 425814}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.89, "brand": "VHS", "asin": "0767812778", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CAQY4V9AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lawrence of Arabia (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}

James Spader  (TV's \"Boston Legal\") ran away with the Best Actor prize at the Cannes Film Festival for his brilliantly understated  and seductive performance as Graham, a long-lost college friend who drifts back into town and into the lives of John,a self-involved philanderer, his angelic wife Ann, and her saucy sister Cynthia. One by one, each is drawn into the very\"personal project\" Graham is working on, leaving the relationships between them forever transformed. A monumental debut effort from first-time feature director Steven Soderbergh (Ocean's Twelve, Traffic, Erin Brockovich), this comic original includes riveting performances from Peter Gallagher (American Beauty), Andie MacDowell (Michael) and Laura San Giacomo (TV's \"Just Shoot Me\").", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006IIPLM", "B000LC3I9W", "B0001VTPUE", "B00006L92O", "B00003CXND", "B0000WN1N6", "B000A2X4BK", "B0006FFRR0", "B000RF7XZ8", "B00LEW3L5Y", "B00HNGC516", "B0041KKXQG", "B00BTYJYOY", "B00DMI56CY", "B00BTYMPSQ", "B0000BXMZ3", "B003DY6ACM", "B002AS463W", "B0027BOL46", "B0000CABBQ", "B00006SFJK", "B001SMC9IU", "B001B18716", "6305922675", "B00003CWSX", "B000RO6JZE", "B000QXDCLA", "0800177029", "0783229623", "B0000844I8", "B0045O2PHS", "B000HT3P56", "B008FYZHDI", "B0002DRDY6", "B000EHSVBE", "6305594333", "0783229402", "6303236588", "B00FZ2NTOM", "B000E5N684", "B000063JDE", "B00112S8RS", "6305918880", "B001AMH7XA", "0767827902", "B000LP6KMQ", "B000CBG5PG", "1573623857", "B00AEFXESQ", "076782170X", "B00005AUJK", "0783230559", "B0043X1FM2", "0792846109", "B00AG473GE", "B00009OWJX", "B0064MT1FI", "0767802616", "B000067IZ3", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00005AUJU", "B000CCBCAS", "B009POCG0Y", "B00006RCNY", "B003O7I6SE", "B00006L91I", "B00023P4N8", "B000EQ5SRK", "B00005JL57", "B0027CSMY0", "B00005JKJA", "B00003CXQ4", "B0024EWP6W", "6304696515", "B000SFJ4HW", "B000C3L2P2", "B00151QYE4", "B002BWP4A6", "B003Y5H59C", "B000F7CEC0", "B000PMFS2I", "0783227906", "B0038Z5T4Q", "B001CW7ZT4", "B000H5TH1Q", "0571202896", "B0043X1FKO", "B0002V7O5Q", "B00005AUKD", "B004YCKKFK", "B000G0O5IM", "6305081034", "B0002KQNKE", "B00008972P", "B00008978N", "B005LS4MQE", "B005VU9LP4", "B00000K31T"], "bought_together": ["B0006IIPLM", "B000LC3I9W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0006IIPLM", "B002AS463W", "B00DL46ZN8", "B00003CXND"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 24268}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "Columbia/Tristar Studios", "asin": "0767812158", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G14AC0W9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sex, Lies, and Videotape"}

{"description": "From the sun-dappled heartland, a young man (Robert Redford, in soft lighting) emerges as maybe the best baseball player anybody's ever seen. On his way to the majors, he is cut down by an enigmatic black widow (Barbara Hershey) and vanishes for many years. When he reemerges, a silent mystery, he lands a spot with the New York team and begins tearing up the league--he's still the natural. Fans of the Bernard Malamud novel will be dismayed at the pure mythical hokum of this film, but baseball fanatics have been known to watch and rewatch this one; after all, it's constructed as a kind of shrine to the national pastime. Barry Levinson (Rain Man) directs the movie with an unabashed devotion to the game, although the film could use more of the realities of chewing tobacco and pine tar. Redford is fine, and Kim Basinger and Oscar-nominated Glenn Close are effective as the women in his life. The crowning touch is the soaring, extraordinary music by Randy Newman, the singer-songwriter turned orchestral composer.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005M20M", "0783235968", "B000068NNT", "630273973X", "6302534372", "6302415853", "6305132666", "0800121600", "6304291698", "B00004RGUU", "6305126062", "630596260X", "B0000399WO", "6301734734", "6303597874", "6302936381", "B00000I1DI", "6303014100", "076780922X", "B0000048ZL", "6300181472", "0792841786", "0790743159", "0792839846", "5559477621", "6302226899", "6302450179", "6302023742", "B0000068ZQ", "630018224X", "6300183513", "630299005X", "B00004RFFA", "B0000068EE", "630150528X", "6300246965", "B00000JGEI", "B000M5BRX2", "6300215695", "6302360978", "6302909023", "6300181154", "6300184927", "0800179552"], "bought_together": ["B00005M20M", "0783235968"], "also_viewed": ["0783235968", "B000003KMM", "B0000399WO", "6300216810"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 348212}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.79, "brand": "", "asin": "0767809262", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51816SHE4HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Natural [VHS]"}
{"description": "This excellent film is probably best described as subtle elegance. Framed in the present, the movie deals with the lives inside an English country home just prior to World War&nbsp;II. Reunited with the filmmakers fromHowards Endare Emma Thompson as Miss Kenton, the head housekeeper, and Anthony Hopkins as Stevens, the impeccable butler. The bittersweet story centers on Stevens and his dedication to his master, Lord Darlington (a suitably officious and slyly pompous James Fox). Stevens summarizes: \"I don't believe a man can consider himself fully content until he has done all he can to be of service to his employer.\" Enveloping Stevens's world are the pending war with Germany, Darlington's horribly misguided interests in said war, and, most effectively, his relationship with Miss Kenton. Stevens is the very essence of repression, but as played by Hopkins he is neither piteous nor self-righteous. Like his master, Stevens becomes misguided in his loyalties, although his is an emotional deprivation, possibly condemning him to lifelong regret. There's so much going on in this film, and yet the action is skillfully depicted through understanding and knowing glances, through emotions expressed only through eye contact. Like other Merchant-Ivory-Ruth Prawer Jhabvala collaborations, this film is sumptuous to look at, capturing the period effectively and affectingly. Jhabvala respectfully adapts from the Kazuo Ishiguro novel. Excellent in supporting roles are Christopher Reeve, Ben Chaplin, and Hugh Grant.--N.F.

{"description": "Despite rave reviews as one of the most stylish and intelligent detective pictures in a number of years, this 1995 adaptation of Walter Mosley's novel never found a mass audience. Too bad, because Carl Franklin's film is nearly perfect in every way, from its rich, shadowy look to its depiction of life in post-World War II black America (L.A.-style) to the acting of Denzel Washington, Don Cheadle, and others. Washington plays Easy Rawlins, an aircraft factory worker who is laid off only to find his true calling: as a private eye, albeit an unlicensed one. Hired to find a missing woman, he becomes entangled in a complex but satisfying case involving sex, corruption, racism, and of course money. Top-notch from top to bottom--and Cheadle is dangerously funny as Easy's best friend, a killer named Mouse.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000542CJ", "6304884400", "B0000549B2", "B00441GZ1Y", "B000244GCC", "B00BTYOYG2", "B0001VTPUO", "B0000VJG72", "B003BV8I3Q", "B0006210ZG", "B00008WJEY", "B004YCKJGU", "B000OT6V0K", "0783230532", "6304765258", "0743451791", "B00005JA9F", "B002GHHHN8", "B00005JPD0", "B000N60HAO", "B00015HVJM", "078324228X", "B00005JLRZ", "630514415X", "0792838076", "B0050MB4OO", "B00005RDAO", "0800177967", "B00125WAWS", "0800141806", "B00L2FSQ08", "B00005AUK9", "B00AEFY6TW", "B0009S4IGA", "B000P0J0CE", "B000BOH8X2", "B000B8TIKY", "B002CPMB9O", "B002LMV7R0", "B00007L4KF", "B00AEFXN9G", "B000GFLKF8", "0743451767", "B00AEFYLBU", "B005KKVAH2", "B00AFEXRME", "B0041QSZS8", "B000002B1D", "B00441GYXI", "B00005JN0W", "0783240295", "B00005JL72", "B00005OSKB", "B00007AJG1", "079074208X", "B00AEBB9N2", "6305505802", "B000244EX8", "B002VWNICC", "B002NZK5UU", "B00441GZ00", "0743451775", "B0000633QV", "B0002V7O5Q", "B005LAIGRS", "B0001XAQ96", "0767811070", "B00005JKWX", "0767818083", "B000065V3J", "B000JJSL1W", "B00124ONGA", "B002VWNIEA", "B00AEFYG3S", "B002CA68N4", "B000XJD34I", "B00005JLX8", "B00066FAQW", "0385535988", "038553597X", "B00005JD5J", "B000059TGC", "B00005U156", "B000ION79E", "B00003L9CG", "B000E40QC4", "B0000TWMQ6", "B004TTOQ4O", "B000VNMMVQ", "6305505780", "B00CP4Y5WS", "0743442547", "B000051YMP", "B002CWKU2M", "B00GOZ2LPM", "0446617903", "B0009GX1CE", "B00005JLG1", "B000GTJSD0", "B000JJSLA8"], "bought_together": ["B00441GZ1Y", "B003BV8I3Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001D7T6CM", "B00DDT0J92", "B00128GITG", "6304884400"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 59172}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 44.99, "brand": "WASHINGTON,DENZEL", "asin": "0767818075", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51lYS%2BR4XVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Devil in A Blue Dress"}
{"description": "As \"gigantic monster reptile attacks New York\" movies go, you've got to admit thatGodzilladelivers the goods, although its critical drubbing and box-office disappointment were arguably deserved. It's a shameless, uninspired crowd pleaser that's content to serve up familiar action with the advantage of really fantastic special effects, and if you expect nothing more you'll be one among millions of satisfied customers. There's really no other way to approach it--you just have to accept the fact thatIndependence Daycreators Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin are unapologetic plagiarists, incapable of anything more than mindless spectacle that can play in any cinema in the world without dubbing or subtitles. The whole movie plays out like a series of highlights stolen from previous blockbusters of the 1990s; it's little more than a rehash of theJurassic Parkmovies. The derivative script is so trivial that it's unworthy of comment, apart from a few choice laughs and the casting of Michael Lerner as New York's mayor, whose name is Ebert and who closely resembles a certain well-known movie critic. Perhaps that's a clever hint that this movie's essentially critic-proof. It's stupid but it's fun, and for most audiences that's a fitting definition of mainstream Hollywood entertainment.

{"description": "This sumptuous and moving 1994 film written and directed by Bernard Rose (Candyman) investigates the artistic and romantic passions of one of the greatest composers of all time. Featuring a superb performance by Gary Oldman (Sid and Nancy) as Ludwig van Beethoven,Immortal Belovedis full of uncommonly vivid, rich imagery as it charts the tumultuous life of the deaf child prodigy and his rise to the height of musical achievement. Along the way, he attempts to play mentor to his nephew, attend to his many passionate romances--the most stable one was with a countess (Isabella Rossellini)--and fight bouts of depression and madness that ruled his life and his art. The film is framed around a \"Rosebud\"-type letter found after the composer's death that makes up the crux of the story. Jeroen Krabb&eacute; (The Fugitive), playing Beethoven's lifelong friend, attempts to discover who Beethoven's muse really was, becoming as driven as his friend in discovering the unlikely identity of the composer's \"immortal beloved.\" Through this we gain an insight into the nature of obsession, romance, and the heights and sacrifices of artistic achievement. The film exhibits some extraordinary sound design, and the finale features a magical encapsulation of Beethoven's life and loves set to his \"Ode to Joy.\" As an exciting and passionate journey,Immortal Belovedis its own masterpiece.--Robert Lane", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 614366}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.9, "brand": "", "asin": "0767824407", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515AXXJZF6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Immortal Beloved [VHS]"}

{"description": "Akira Kurosawa's sequel toYojimbois more lighthearted and less cynical, a rousing adventure with Toshir&ocirc; Mifune reprising his role as the scruffy mercenary who becomes an unlikely big brother to a troupe of nine naive samurai. Shuffling into a secret meeting where the proud young men discuss the graft choking their clan, Mifune's Sanjuro scratches his scraggly beard and distractedly rubs his neck like some common peasant while giving them advice on appearances and truths: \"People aren't what they seem,\" he warns the dubious lads. \"Be careful.\" Naturally they aren't, and Sanjuro grudgingly adopts the well-meaning but hopelessly ill-equipped heroes, giving the starry-eyed youths a series of lessons in real-world honor and respect while saving their skins from reckless attacks and impulsive plans. It isn't the subtlest of Kurosawa's films--the repetitious lessons and speeches delivered to the thickheaded samurai are rather obvious--but it's one of his most entertaining. Mifune, gruffly at ease with the boys, is hilariously discomforted in the presence of a cultured lady, who sees through his shaggy exterior and imparts a little wisdom of her own. Mifune bounds into action in a number of impressive sword fights--wonderfully choreographed lightning-quick battles in which Mifune leaps all over the widescreen image--but an increasing sense of waste, of futility, hangs over the action scenes, culminating in a tense but meaningless duel of honor. The accompanying trailer on the DVD features brief behind-the-scenes glimpses of Kurosawa directing Mifune through an action sequence.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000G8NXYG", "B00005B1ZL", "B001BEK8E2", "B002E01MBA", "B00K5EJHGO", "B00005JLEJ", "B00180R072", "B000AQKUD6", "B000067IY6", "B0007989YS", "B00000K0DM", "B007N5YK10", "B00005JLMU", "B00687XNNK", "6305028699", "B0009WIE2A", "0780021045", "0780021061", "B000ASATM6", "B001WLMOL4", "B000BB14I0", "B000C6NP7M", "B005D0RDPM", "B00004Y7HL", "B000BR6QCI", "B000XPSC0C", "B005JJCMN0", "B0001UZZSG", "B000NOK0H6", "B004XQO8MS", "B002ZG4Q5W", "B006H3KQSK", "B000AQKUGI", "B000056NWP", "B00005QAPH", "B000PC6Z48", "B0017MO0U6", "B0001VO38S", "B00019JR5Y", "B0000B1ODS", "B000E5LEV0", "B00004W3HF", "B00000C0QO", "B00005NC66", "B001PCNZJU", "B000FS9FIK", "B00B2BYXSQ", "B00065GX0K", "B000AQKUG8", "B002BWP4A6", "0792841409", "6305257450", "B003N2CVQ8", "B002AFX53W", "B00000CQJZ", "B004KDYR7A", "B000AQKUC2", "B003KGBISY", "B003VA3JTA", "B00005JLV7", "B003WKL6XA", "B00009V7OB", "6304698798", "B0000A02TW", "B005D0RDCU", "B005152C7S", "B000AQKUH2", "B000WEH74G", "B0007GAG42", "B00AEFYSEA", "B000059TFW", "B008CJ0JS4", "B000FDECGA", "B007Y1NR1W", "B00005UQ7T", "078002205X", "0792839056", "0780020707", "B0080WPADW", "B001LMU1C8", "B00AQ6J64O", "B000025RE7", "B0002V7O0Q", "0783225903", "B001O549G6", "B007K7IAYY", "B004NWPY20", "B000BQ5J18", "B000065V38", "B001LMU1B4", "B00DHN8FXG", "B00065GX64", "B000I8OOG0", "0780022343", "B0049985XW", "B000055Y0X", "B0026VBOJC", "0780022041", "B00GBT62N8", "B00005A8TX"], "bought_together": ["B000G8NXYG", "B001BEK8E2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000K0YM0Y", "B000G8NXYG", "B00008RH1H", "B001BEK8E2"]}, "price": 24.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 185087}, "asin": "0780022491", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KN3PM18EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sanjuro (The Criterion Collection)"}

{"description": "Maverick film director Samuel Fuller was doing some of his best work in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and in the years since its release in 1963,Shock Corridorhas become a B-movie classic and a prime example of Fuller's gritty tabloid style. Never hesitant to explore the darkened corners of contemporary life, Fuller depicts the chambers of an insane asylum as a microcosm of American society, telling the story of a cynical, ambitious journalist (Peter Breck) whose obsessive quest for a Pulitzer Prize leads him into the depths of madness. To investigate a murder, the reporter goes undercover in a mental hospital, having convinced a psychiatrist that he needs treatment. Once inside the asylum, he pieces together clues to the murder, but his own mind begins to deteriorate until he's trapped in a downward spiral towards insanity. Fuller heightens the melodrama with his aggressive style of filmmaking (his next film,The Naked Kiss, proved even more effective), and his imaginative use of black-and-white cinematography (by noted cameraman Stanley Cortez) fills the movie with raw, emotional power. It's the kind of film one would expect from a rebellious director on the Hollywood fringe, and that's whyShock Corridorremains an enduring low-budget examination of the \"rat race\" and the consequences of pursuing success at any cost. The Criterion Collection DVD presents the film in its original 1.85:1 aspect ratio, and a rarely seen color dream sequence has been fully restored.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0047P5FTA", "B00012L786", "B00005AUK9", "B0024FAG6W", "B00005AUKD", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B000QXDFS0", "B001GCATWA", "B00005JKGX", "B00ICWO1LC", "B0007PALOI", "B00005V6N6", "B0002V7O0Q", "B00DZP1BUU", "B0001US78Q", "B000AQKUH2", "B001LMU1C8", "B0007GAG42", "B00DZP1C9K", "1559409002", "B004C2523M", "B005152C9G", "B0006Z2NE0", "B00005QAPH", "B0024FAG80", "B000025RE7", "B0007989Y8", "B004ALIG4M", "B00I116MVQ", "B00065GX64", "B000BB14IA", "B00005BHW6", "0780022076", "B00CUKTHES", "B0007TKNLA", "B000MTEFOQ", "B001LMU19G", "B000093NQZ", "B00H8J2NTC", "B00007L4I6", "B001BEK8C4", "B004NWPY3E", "0780023099", "B000B8384Q", "B007N5YJMA", "B003ZYU3U0", "B003ICZW7I", "B000M2E3GI", "B001CW7ZT4", "B00005BH23", "B00EL6A7XE", "B005152C7S", "B00180R072", "B0007MANYY", "B00005A8TX", "0780022270", "B00000C0QO", "B00AQ6J6H6", "B00004TJKI", "B006TTC5MM", "B000244EYW", "B000B83846", "0780022823", "B00E18QKJ2", "B004WPYO7E", "B0002JP2OS", "B00IKM5OCO", "B009RWRINE", "B00007ELDG", "B001D8W7F4", "B0009X7682", "B00005N7Z1", "0783228457", "B000067IY4", "0780021134", "B001WLMOL4", "B00000F3CD", "B001BSBBIK", "B008Y5OVZ8", "B0024FAG8A", "B007N5YK10", "078002205X", "B006ML50SS", "B00006673L", "B00000IOKV", "6305999872", "B00AQ6J64O", "B00393SG42", "B00DZP1BVO", "B00AQ6J56S", "B0009X75EC", "B000AQKUG8", "B00005QAPJ", "B0012KSUUE", "0780022041", "B00004YZFR", "B005HK13S6", "B000B8380A", "B00005JLV7", "B004NWPY7A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0024FAG6W", "B003WKL6XA", "0780022041", "078002205X"]}, "price": 24.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 248126}, "asin": "0780021096", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NZARPYHEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Shock Corridor (The Criterion Collection)"}
{"description": "Criterion's release of Carl Dreyer's landmark filmThe Passion of Joan of Arcis a definitive example of DVD restoration. Initially believed to be lost forever in a fire, this transfer was created at 24 frames per second from a negative of the rediscovered original version. For a film released in 1928,The Passion of Joan of Arclooks absolutely remarkable. As with most silent films, Dreyer'sJoanwas originally presented to audiences with different pieces of music. Criterion has chosen composer Richard Einhorn'sVoices of Lightfor this edition. Inspired by the film, Einhorn's piece, presented in 5.1 surround sound, is a wonderful compliment to Dreyer's visual presentation.   Notable extras include a history of the film's many versions and an audio interview with Renee Falconetti's daughter. However, by far the best \"extra\" is Dreyer scholar Casper Tybjerg's incredible commentary that informatively combines rich details of the film's importance and content with known historical elements of St. Joan's life, trial and death.--Rob Bracco", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000029NX", "B00005M2C7", "B00180R06I", "B00092ZLEY", "6305131104", "B00005JLV7", "6305257450", "B00005BHW6", "B000HT3QBO", "B0002DCHQA", "B000BB14IA", "B005HK13S6", "6305744114", "B00005O5CA", "B0000A02TX", "B000V7HFL4", "B0001UZWMU", "B005152C7S", "6305081034", "B00007CVS8", "B00006JMQG", "B0007989Y8", "B00HE011DE", "B001298BPY", "B001CD6HQA", "B001M9ELJY", "B00EO2I6W4", "B005HK13OK", "B000BB14I0", "B00000JS6F", "B00005UQ7T", "B001WLMOL4", "B00005QAPH", "B000E5LEV0", "B0056ANHCC", "B00005EBSF", "0780021541", "B000VUQ4HW", "0767845722", "B00065GX64", "B00GG0NABE", "B00006JMQH", "B006X96PBU", "B008CJ0JS4", "B0009WIE2U", "B0040QYROA", "B002U6DVQ2", "B000I8OOG0", "B001LMU1C8", "B00J2PQZRQ", "B000093NR0", "B004WPYO7E", "B00005NC66", "B002E01MBA", "B00004XQN5", "B000093NQZ", "B0007989ZC", "B00HVOFP08", "B00BX49B0C", "B000ZM1MIM", "B000AQKUG8", "1885983085", "B000BR6QIW", "B000EU1OXI", "B000FS9FLW", "B000N2HBIO", "B00005UQ7Q", "B0036SPDEG", "B00HE010LC", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B00J5LXMTG", "B00D9BNONW", "B00005JKPT", "B0002V7O0Q", "B00HVOFP6W", "B000PKG6O4", "B0002JP2OS", "B0026VBOJW", "B0000B1O9L", "B00005JLMU", "B001LMU19G", "B0012KHTEC", "B0001UZZS6", "0780020707", "B005152CC8", "B00393SFU2", "B004NWPY20", "B007N5YJPC", "B00005QW58", "B0035ECI0I", "B0000633SD", "B000127IF2", "B003WKL6YO", "B000305ZYS", "B00GRA7M2G", "B001MPS7GG", "B00064AEWY", "B00004Z1FM", "B000NOK0H6", "B004NWPY3E"], "bought_together": ["B0000029NX"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00000JS6F", "B0000029NX", "0767845722", "6305999872"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 49803}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 25.9, "brand": "DREYER,CARL", "asin": "0780022343", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4154H8KT15L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Passion of Joan of Arc (The Criterion Collection)"}

Scripted by rapper Ice Cube,Fridayis a no-frills tale of a typical day in the life of a pair of African American youth in South Central.

Then unknown Chris Tucker plays Smokey, a marijuana-worshipping homeboy whose love for the green stuff lands him in predicament after predicament. Sitting on the stoop of Craig's rundown home, the two hilariously confront a kaleidoscopic array of gangbangers, weed dealers, crack heads, prostitutes, scheming girlfriends, and neighborhood bullies--all of whom, it should be noted, come off as sympathetic even as they are being caricatured, a true achievement in the crass, \"booty call\" environment of '90s African American comedy.--Ethan Brown", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301217977", "B00004W9C6", "B00004YZEG", "6303000657", "6302878748", "6302298695", "B000087LIJ", "6304008082", "6305668426", "B00005QASQ"], "bought_together": ["6301217977"], "also_viewed": ["B001DJLD12", "B00004W9C6", "B004H83INW", "6300183211", "B000087LIJ", "6303953425", "0780631234"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 277095}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0780608372", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C08GCQWQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Friday [VHS]"}
{"description": "A wicked satirical fable about corporate backstabbing--and actual murder--in the movie business,The Playerbenefits from director Robert Altman's long and bitter experience working within, and without, the Hollywood studio system. Rising young executive Griffin Mill (Tim Robbins) is tormented by threats from an anonymous writer.  The pressure and paranoia build until Griffin loses control one night and semi-accidentally kills screenwriter David Kahane (Vincent D'Onofrio), who may or may not be the source of the threats. From that point, Griffin's life and career begin to fall apart. In keeping with the ironic spirit of the film itself, Altman's scathingly funny attack on the moral bankruptcy of Hollywood was embraced by many of the same people it was intended to savage, and restored the director to commercial and critical favor. Michael Tolkin adapted the screenplay from his own novel, and the movie is studded with cameos by famous faces, many of whom appear as themselves. The digital video disc includes a commentary track with Altman and Tolkin, some deleted scenes, a documentary about Altman, and a key to help identify more than 50 of the picture's big-name cameos.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001CW7ZT4", "B000063K2Q", "6305918880", "B00006HAWL", "B00000IQCA", "B000069HZU", "B0009A40EI", "B00AEFXN9G", "B0006Q9482", "B008NNY8TK", "B00005OOQ2", "B0050FXDDQ", "B00007AJF8", "B000CNESU8", "B003XTOBU0", "B004YCKKFK", "B002U6DVPS", "B00006RCNV", "B000TXNDV6", "B00079Z9VO", "B0001GH5TW", "B00005K3NV", "6305999872", "B00005JLRE", "B0006GAOJA", "B002VWNICC", "B00AEBB89C", "0792846109", "B00AQ6J64O", "B000021Y77", "B00003CWTI", "B0087ZG7R0", "B00000JGHT", "B00002E20R", "B00005JKNF", "B0002XNSZE", "B000286RP2", "0792833279", "B00GJNQ3I0", "B0087ZG7OI", "0790742454", "B0000WN0ZK", "0767821629", "0767830555", "B001B1UO7G", "B000286RNE", "B000XECFXS", "B00005JL57", "B00005AUK9", "B000069I09", "B0006HBV3C", "B005152C9G", "B00008RH3J", "B0045HCJ9E", "6305428085", "B000QXDCLK", "B003ZYU3U0", "B003BZ58RQ", "B0000VD04M", "B00005O06J", "6305922756", "6304907729", "B0007GAG42", "B007UW9W32", "B00H96KG2U", "0792833287", "B000MTFFPO", "B0009GX1CE", "B00BLN4UDS", "B005KQVE1S", "B000CNESTE", "B000929VTU", "B001EOQCMG", "B0001EFTTW", "B000C20VVE", "B00JVQ7PWU", "B0006GAOMW", "B000QXDFRG", "B0000694Z2", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B0002I83Z4", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00005S8KV", "B003O7I6SE", "B00005JKJA", "B000BX8R10", "B00005BCK9", "B0010YVCI4", "B00005AUJK", "B00020X88Y", "B0006GANN2", "B00005JKM2", "0780622251", "B001WLMOLE", "B000099T4G", "B005152C7S", "B0064NTZQ2", "B000FFJYAW", "B00AEFYVUQ"], "bought_together": ["B001CW7ZT4", "B000063K2Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007NPYP24", "B001CW7ZT4", "B00BMJ7ZKG", "B00F98FOI6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 61694}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 26.24, "brand": "NEW Line Home Video", "asin": "0780618564", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YNRE99QZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Player (Special Edition) (New Line Platinum Series)"}
{"description": "Not only was Barry Levinson's comedy shot in a relatively fast period of 29 days, the satire of politics and show business feels as if it were made yesterday. There's a fresh spin quite evident here, a nervy satire of a presidential crisis and the people who whitewash the facts. The main players are a mysterious Mr. Fix-It (Robert De Niro), veteran Hollywood producer (Dustin Hoffman), and a White House aide (Anne Heche). Can the president's molesting of a young girl be buried in the two weeks before an election? A war in Albania just might do the trick. In the good old days, the president would just invade. With modern technology, it's even cleaner. The hungry press looks for any lead, convenient misinformation is created by the latest Hollywood fakery (\"all developed by the new James Cameron film\") creating images and merchandise all instantly packaged. And it must be real, because it's on TV. David Mamet's script never questions the morals or the absolute secrecy needed to pull this thing off. He and director Barry Levinson have enough truth in the story to make you wonder what is real news and what is just promotion the next time you see CNN. Many of the supporting players impact the story with mere presence: Denis Leary as a quote man, Willie Nelson as a songwriter. The three leads are magnificent. With the similarities between history and this film,Wagwill forever linked to the Monica Lewinsky saga. This video version contains a new minidocumentary focusing on the parallels of the film with the Bill Clinton scandal, including comments from director Barry Levinson and hosted by newsman Tom Brokaw.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783227973", "6305297142", "B000H0MKOC", "B000CNESU8", "B00005OOQ2", "B0013XZ2QK", "B001MVWFAO", "B001TH92N4", "B000CEXEWA", "B001AMHNKW", "B000E1NXJ0", "B006ML50QK", "B00003CXP7", "B00000IPG4", "B0000WN0SC", "B000MXPE7O", "B000055Y0X", "6305428522", "B00003CWRX", "B00DDY45DI", "B007KAUWO2", "6305428115", "B00007G1YQ", "B00005BCK9", "B0060ZJ7DA", "B000YQT7QI", "B00AEBB9SM", "B00005J75F", "0790731460", "B004UOHNAC", "B004GJYRKK", "B00000IQC0", "6305161879", "B000BITV92", "B000CNESTE", "B00020X88Y", "B000LC5B7O", "B0007TKNF6", "B001IHJ988", "B00022XE6S", "B001GLX6UI", "B002AS464Q", "B0007R4T3U", "B000P0J0AQ", "B007UW9W5U", "B003UESJEM", "B00441GYOM", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00AZNEW5G", "B00005JMET", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B003O7I6SE", "B000F7CMRM", "B000P0J0AG", "B0001907AI", "B0000YEEGM", "B0033AI4CK", "B00005UQ9T", "B00000JGPE", "B004FQX59I", "0792833287", "B0006210ZG", "B003N9ASF2", "B003ASLJIQ", "B002NZK5UU", "B001DE29SI", "6304696507", "0780631536", "B00003CX8U", "6305781095", "0767811100", "B00AEBB8LA", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00AEFXN9G", "B000C3L2IO", "B0034G4P7G", "B00005JKBC", "B0041KKYBA", "0783219571", "B000ZM1MG4", "0790732238", "B000P0J0BK", "B00014NEZI", "B00005MEOU", "B000H5TH20", "B00AEFYR3C", "B00003CXRM", "B0001GH7VS", "B001AQO3RO", "B00AW8OZ88", "B003ASLJQ8", "B00006RCNV", "B00029LNYQ", "B0001EFV7C", "B004FQX5B6", "B000244GCW", "0792833279", "B0008ENHUI", "B002GOAGZC", "B000P0J0EW"], "bought_together": ["0783227973", "6305297142"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004GJYRKK", "0783227973", "B000H0MKOC", "B002VWNICC"]}, "price": 5.97, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18193}, "asin": "0780622561", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51arIQeW%2BlL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wag the Dog (New Line Platinum Series)"}
{"description": "Edward Norton was nominated for a 1998 Best Actor Oscar for his role as  Derek Vinyard, a thoughtful kid turned neo-Nazi after his father is slain.  Edward Furlong plays his younger brother, Danny, determined to follow in his brother's footsteps.  The easy routes the film seems prepared to take never materialize.  It continually makes Derek's transformation both in and out of his racist beliefs believable and persuasive.  Stacy Keach is given the head vampire role of the local skinhead chapter, Cameron, and he's the closest this film comes to an overt overstatement.  Norton, however, is fantastic, embodying a person who roller-coasters through hatred like he can't wait to ride again.  His diatribes are not unlike what can be heard on any given conservative radio station on any given day, but he doesn't spew them as cant or screed.  Only when his violent emotions take charge, negating any sense or stand, is the underlying fallacy and nature of his beliefs made plain. This film was undermined by the film's own director, Tony Kaye, who made such a braying ass of himself and his work that it distorted the public's view of what is an interesting social and psychological lesson in the war between ideas and ideologues, reason and racism.--Keith Simanton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303686796", "B00004W5UA", "B00000J2L7"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 321982}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.59, "brand": "", "asin": "0780625129", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516KFV9DGKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "American History X [VHS]"}

{"description": "Hoo-ah! After seven Oscar nominations for his outstanding work in films such asThe Godfather,Serpico, andDog Day Afternoon, it's ironic that Al Pacino finally won the Oscar for his grandstanding lead performance in this 1992 crowd pleaser. As the blind, blunt, and ultimately benevolent retired Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade, Pacino is both hammy and compelling, simultaneously subtle and grandly over-the-top when defending his new assistant and prep school student Charlie (Chris O'Donnell) at a disciplinary hearing. While the subplot involving Charlie's prep-school crisis plays like a sequel toDead Poets Society, Pacino's adventurous escapades in New York City provide comic relief, rich character development, and a memorable supporting role for Gabrielle Anwar as the young woman who accepts the colonel's invitation to dance the tango.Scent of a Womanis a remake of the 1972 Italian filmProfumo di donna. In addition to Pacino's award, the picture garnered Oscar nominations for director Martin Brest and for screenwriter Bo Goldman.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790734079", "630445600X", "6303402070", "6304259131", "0800125762", "B000007OY0", "B00004WIDB", "0800100832", "6303486746", "6302415853", "6301697758", "6301578805", "0783235607", "6303269834"], "bought_together": ["0790734079"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 307456}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.83, "brand": "Scent Of A Woman", "asin": "0783204914", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514CEATZ0DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Scent of a Woman [VHS]"}

(Universal Pictures' spectacularly gorgeous 1996 restoration and rerelease of this 1958 Paramount production was a tremendous success with the public, too.)

The detective and the disturbed woman fall (\"fall\" is indeed the operative word) in love and...well, to give away any more of the story would be criminal.

We're never sure if the hitcher is a figment of his imagination, making Howell a schizophrenic killer, or if he's real and Howell is the random victim of a wandering madman, which is how his potential new girlfriend (Jennifer Jason Leigh) thinks of him.

The story (ifDunecan be said to have just one story) is complex and convoluted in the epic tradition; it has something to do with political intrigue and a planet that is home to a precious spice and gigantic sand worms. Think Shakespeare'sHenry IVwith a dash ofTremors, and set in another galaxy. But despite plenty of strangely whispered voice-overs that explain the characters' thoughts (and endlessly detailed exposition), storytelling is not really among the film's strong points. There are, however, a lot of memorably fantastic/grotesque images, an extraordinary cast, and a soundtrack featuring Toto. I told you it was weird.

{"description": "The second film in Oliver Stone's Vietnam trilogy moves from the brutality of war inPlatoonto its equally traumatic aftermath. Based on the memoir of combat veteran Ron Kovic, the film stars Tom Cruise as Kovic, whose gunshot wound in Vietnam left him paralyzed from the chest down. He is deeply embittered by neglect in a veteran's hospital and by the shattering of his patriotic idealism because of the horror and futility of the Vietnam conflict. While painfully and awkwardly adjusting to his disability and a changing definition of masculinity, Kovic joins the burgeoning movement of antiwar protest, culminating in a climactic appearance at the 1976 Democratic national convention. A powerfully intimate portrait that unfolds on an epic scale,Born on the Fourth of Julyis arguably Stone's best film (if you can forgive its often strident tone), and Cruise's Oscar-nominated role is uncompromising in its depiction of one man's personal anguish and political awakening.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["079284646X", "B006TTC5HC", "B0015D20FE", "B000ELL1R6", "B000B8QG22", "B000P0J09C", "B00031V21M", "B00005V9HI", "B003ELKNH2", "B004FQX59I", "B00AEBBA36", "B00AEFXR1K", "B000GAKDAG", "B00000IQC0", "B00005JN2Z", "B0018QPPXW", "B00AEBB86U", "B000065V3G", "B000035Z5G", "1888451785", "B00005PJ8T", "B00001ZWUS", "B00005B6JZ", "B0013FCWUW", "B0000YEEGM", "B000M4RG42", "B000RTB0R6", "B00AEFY0F2", "B004U7MR1Y", "0800141741", "0783226810", "B00AEBB9LO", "B000E1NXJ0", "B00005JA9F", "B00275EGWY", "B003ASLJOU", "B001TUZG4K", "B00005JNTI", "B002OGMGV4", "B000CEXEWA", "0767830555", "B0002WZTOI", "B000EHSVS2", "B00AEFXYJA", "B00B0U2SFE", "B00004RF82", "B00080ZG10", "B00005JK8K", "B004FQX5B6", "B000059TFO", "B000065U1N", "B00008G8M4", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B0000542CI", "B000O599YO", "B000G6BLHY", "B003BV8I3Q", "B00005J760", "0800141806", "B004SIP7ZS", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B00005N5S2", "B0006GAOJA", "B000P0J09M", "B001MVWFAO", "B00AEBB95K", "B000C20VPA", "B0043X1FL8", "B000U788WU", "0767817745", "B003ASLJQI", "B004SIP7TE", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B000BRP4BM", "B000FVQLQQ", "B000CNESTE", "B00005JPKE", "B0004Z33EG", "B00000K0DQ", "B000GG4Y32", "B00005JL78", "B000059HAN", "6305428522", "B004AOECXI", "B000PAAJZ6", "B001TH92N4", "B000ZM1MGE", "B00BTYJYR6", "0783225733", "B0006GANN2", "0767836359", "B00008CMRK", "B004GJYRI2", "B003HKN52U", "0800177967", "B000FVQLRA", "B00011CZRE", "B00009W5CA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["079284646X", "B00001ZWUS", "B006TTC5HC", "B000B8QG22"]}, "price": 8.48, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 263904}, "asin": "0783226764", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510WBGNCT9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Born on the Fourth of July"}

{"description": "After building up the duo's popularity through popular recordings and several performances onSaturday Night Live,John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd--as \"legendary\" Chicago blues brothers Jake and Elwood Blues--took their act to the big screen in this action-packed hit from 1980. As Jake and Elwood struggle to reunite their old band and save the Chicago orphanage where they were raised, they wreak enough good-natured havoc to attract the entire Cook County police force. The result is a big-budget stunt-fest on a scale rarely attempted before or since, including extended car chases that result in the wanton destruction of shopping malls and more police cars than you can count. Along the way there's plenty of music to punctuate the action, including performances by Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Cab Calloway, and James Brown that are guaranteed to knock you out. As played with deadpan wit by Belushi and Aykroyd, the Blues Brothers are \"on a mission from God,\" and that gives them a kind of reckless glee that keeps the movie from losing its comedic appeal. Otherwise this might have been just a bloated marathon of mayhem that quickly wears out its welcome (which is how some critics described this film and its 1998 sequel). Keep an eye out for Steven Spielberg as the city clerk who stamps some crucial paperwork near the end of the film.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783227078", "6300182150", "B000005PFL", "0800198395", "6302877881", "6301569385", "6300989003", "630220366X", "6305576173", "B000006N70", "6304071876", "6301300394", "B00005Q4GY", "6301971809", "630281622X", "0800132009", "B0000068ZQ", "6305363668", "B00005RRG6", "6301697294", "6304196954", "0783202253", "6300181987", "6301208773", "6302032377", "0800116917", "6304107250", "6303168507", "0766202771", "0783235607", "6300246965", "B000077VT7", "6302909023", "630150528X", "6304155972", "B000005QWI", "B000007PI9", "630470786X", "6300214567", "6303057225", "0792839846", "B00000JGEK"], "bought_together": ["0783227078"], "also_viewed": ["6300182150", "B000005PFL", "B00000JKNP", "B00003CXCQ", "B00G5G7EXY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 240790}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.98, "brand": "", "asin": "0783225199", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BZ5ANGQ2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blues Brothers [VHS]"}

{"description": "Notorious Puerto Rican heroin dealer Carlito Brigante (Al Pacino) is released from jail on a technicality thanks to the manipulations of his sleazy lawyer buddy (Sean Penn). All he wants is to keep his nose clean and earn enough money to start a business in the Bahamas--and maybe rekindle romance with his old flame, played by Penelope Ann Miller. Instead he finds himself back in trouble as a result of old-world codes of honor and misguided loyalties. It all takes place in 1975 Manhattan, in and around a nightclub Carlito manages, so there's plenty of classic disco music pulsing on the soundtrack. John Leguizamo plays one of the younger generation of hoodlums out to prove something. Viggo Mortensen and Luis Guzmn star as a couple of Carlito's buddies from the old days. Brian DePalma, who directed Pacino a decade earlier in SCARFACE, makes this seem almost like that film's sequel. As expected, there's plenty of elaborate tracking shots and suspenseful set pieces, most memorably a pulse-pounding chase through Grand Central Station.

As her college valedictorian, Lelaina Pierce (Ryder) should be destined for greatness. In reality she is a lowly production assistant for an obnoxious TV morning show host (John Mahoney). In her free time, Lelaina is making a biting, often outrageous video documentary about her peers: promiscuous, '70's-crazed roommate Vickie (Janeane Garafalo), sexually repressed Sammy (Steve Zahn) and best friend Troy (Hawke), a brilliant but unmotivated rebel. Meanwhile, Lelaina meets Michael (Stiller), an ambitious video executive who wants to showcase her documentary on \"In Your Face TV.\" Suddenly, she finds herself at the center of a very odd love triangle with dependable, fast-track Michael on the one side and a sexy, brooding Troy on the other.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001B3LIO2", "6305283516", "B0053TWVQ4", "B002O3Z4VG", "B000002WPW", "B00CIOD6HK", "B00003CXGA", "B000031EG0", "B0045DO84C", "B00000F0AD", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B00AEFXE9U", "0783230486", "6305428425", "B001PJRATE", "B002JOUNE8", "B004YCKJSS", "B000BOH904", "B00000IQW4", "B0009UZFZQ", "B00447L4KA", "B00029RTAI", "B00DJYJPLO", "B002D755A8", "B0043X1FOU", "B00AG475K8", "B001AEF6BS", "B004SIP95G", "B0000640VJ", "B00002VWE0", "B004SUDQ72", "B000065V3H", "6305144168", "B00AEFYM2S", "B00003CXDJ", "B007UW9W32", "B001AEF6BI", "B000M341QE", "6304907729", "B002AFX53M", "B00003CWQR", "0800177029", "B0000542C7", "B00BMKGZVA", "B0053TWVZA", "B000087EY5", "B000E5N684", "B000PAAJZ6", "B00027JZ3E", "B001UV4XUG", "B0007PALZ2", "B0009A40ES", "B0006GANPA", "B00005JNC2", "B0045HCJGW", "B00AG473GE", "B00008G7UL", "B00005AUJU", "B004UVYQVY", "B000CNESJO", "B0018YCF50", "B00AJCOZVY", "0800177258", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00005T7I1", "B00C6F61HS", "B000K7VHLY", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B005QX8UEE", "B0007UC8Y4", "B004SIP6LS", "B00007BKVC", "B00003CY6D", "B000065V3W", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEBB9DW", "B00029RTCG", "0767835093", "B004SIPALY", "B000765IJK", "B008R65Y28", "B00079Z9VO", "B00005JKFA", "6305313687", "B00AFEY354", "0767805712", "B00001W9G0", "B000GFLKF8", "B00006ZXSL", "B0000C3I99", "B0016Q2D66", "0783229402", "B00008G7UI", "B004P7CN7W", "B00005JLFA", "B001DN0V02", "B00AEFYCL4", "B0009UZGIM", "B002VWNIDG", "B000RGSOR8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00000IQW4", "B00008438V", "B00007AJGH", "B00005N7Z1"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 185128}, "asin": "0783227922", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FXQ4N7EGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Reality Bites"}

{"description": "Proving that he may be the most fearless actor of his or any other generation, Harvey Keitel gives an amazing, no-holds-barred performance in director Abel Ferrara's uncompromising 1992 film about a New York cop on the edge of self-annihilation. The film's title is meant to be taken literally: Keitel's character has no redeeming values whatsoever, save for his desperate need for redemption. Leonard Maltin'sMovie & Video Guideis correct in calling this an \"over-the-top Catholic guilt movie,\" but it's been made with such conviction that Ferrara and Keitel transcend the sheer unpleasantness of the material to give it a kind of tragic divinity. Here's a character so vile and corrupted that he consumes or re-sells the drugs he confiscates, but when he's assigned to investigate the brutal rape of a nun who refuses to press charges, he feels that this is his opportunity to redeem his rotten soul. Deservedly rated NC-17 due to its rough content and a frontal nude scene that even Keitel's most loyal fans could do without, this film tends to divide viewers into love-it-or-hate-it categories, but few could deny its raw power and the deeply anguished humanity that Keitel brings to his role. Whatever your reaction may be, few would deny this is an unforgettable film.--Jeff Shannon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 241507}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Bad Lieutenant", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001FGBUW", "B002TVQ48K", "B000286RP2", "B00005O5AY", "6305594333", "B0001US62I", "6305505802", "0767830555", "0767802519", "B00JV0547O", "0783230443", "B00008975Z", "0792838068", "B000A2UBN4", "B0006GAOJA", "B000063JDE", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B003KGBISE", "B000P0J0D8", "B00006RCNV", "B002AF4Y9G", "B0000DI87S", "B004KDYR20", "B00008RH3L", "B00008K7AO", "0792833287", "B0064MT1FI", "B00005UQ9T", "B00005R2IS", "B00005QBZA", "B00002RAO2", "B001B1UO7G", "B0057ZAA6W", "B000PAAJZ6", "B00IKM5OCO", "B003L20IEC", "B00GOT11TA", "B00062IVM6", "B0000542CB", "0790729342", "B00005Y6XB", "B0009OUBC4", "B00AEBB95K", "B0045HCJSU", "B00000IC7G", "B0001FGBW0", "B00005V9HH", "B00LEW3L5Y", "B000059TFP", "B003TRMLQM", "B00125WATQ", "B000QXDCLK", "B001AS32QK", "B004SIP6WW", "B003ELKNH2", "B000022TS6", "B000JU7JIW", "B000C20VRS", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B00005QCVX", "B00007L4KI", "B0001EFV7C", "B00112S8RS", "B0024EWP6W", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B0009X768W", "B000UO4F7U", "B000286RPM", "B00009W5CA", "B009POCG0Y", "B001TOD92C", "B00027JYBW", "0792846435", "B000BR9S96", "B001152TL6", "B006KH6CF4", "B00HVOFP6W", "B000A7DVR2", "B000929UOQ", "B0041QSZS8", "B00699G622", "B0006HBV3C", "B00005JLJW", "B000CNESTE", "B0007P0X9G", "B00HOGBXS6", "B004YCKKFK", "B00004XPPB", "B00005JN2Z", "B00005YJMX", "B00005Q4CS", "B00005QAOZ", "B00GDDNFDW", "B00151QYSK", "6305313687", "B00049QQHI", "B000BBOUW2", "B000089770", "B00003CXZ4", "B0000AQS1H"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002TVQ48K", "B0001FGBUW", "B001V32UF8", "B002T9H2LA"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519HBKXXMTL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "0784011559"}
{"description": "From the moment that Prince Eric's ship emerged from the fog in the opening credits it was apparent that Disney had somehow, suddenly recaptured that \"magic\" that had been dormant for thirty years. In the tale of a headstrong young mermaid who yearns to \"spend a day, warm on the sand,\" Ariel trades her voice to Ursula, the Sea Witch (classically voiced by Pat Carroll), for a pair of legs.

{"description": "Stanley Kubrick dissects the nature of violence in this darkly ironic, near-future satire, adapted from Anthony Burgess's novel, complete with \"Nadsat\" slang. Classical music-loving proto-punk Alex (Malcolm McDowell) and his \"Droogs\" spend their nights getting high at the Korova Milkbar before embarking on \"a little of the old ultraviolence,\" such as terrorizing a writer, Mr. Alexander (Patrick Magee), and gang raping his wife (who later dies as a result). After Alex is jailed for bludgeoning the Cat Lady (Miriam Karlin) to death with one of her phallic sculptures, Alex submits to the Ludovico behavior modification technique to earn his freedom; he's conditioned to abhor violence through watching gory movies, and even his adored Beethoven is turned against him. Returned to the world defenseless, Alex becomes the victim of his prior victims, with Mr. Alexander using Beethoven's Ninth to inflict the greatest pain of all. When society sees what the state has done to Alex, however, the politically expedient move is made.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790734079", "0790705141", "B00004U8PA", "B00000FZCU", "6303953425", "6304484054", "0783235607", "6304039220", "630268644X", "B00006G8O1", "0790700506", "B0002G2B2W", "6305576173", "B000059HCI", "B00008X5J1", "0792837797", "B00000J2KZ", "6300267881", "6301977742", "6300216713", "6300269132", "B00000I1DI", "6302783356", "6300214826", "6305095566", "B00005JLET", "6302054982", "0800103106", "6302201845", "6302798450", "B00000J2L7", "6304994540", "6303686796", "B00005PJ8I", "6300216500", "0783228317", "6303107338", "6304935811", "B00004W5UA", "6302610702", "0783246641", "6300183211", "6302921058", "0792842111", "B00004T37H", "B00002E285", "B00003CXE6", "B000007OY0", "6301971582", "6300184064", "B00005LL26", "0790736039"], "bought_together": ["0790734079", "0790705141"], "also_viewed": ["0393312836", "0790705141", "B0013FSXT6", "B00GGAK0FS", "B008RO875Q", "B004O724M2", "B00004TLMC", "B00023NRSM", "B008M4MB8K", "6305440093", "6303953425", "6303939015", "6303148387", "6303861733", "B00003CXB4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 296220}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790701022", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EV1DQCCGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Clockwork Orange"}
{"description": "The come-from-behind winner of the 1981 Oscar for best picture,Chariots of Fireeither strikes you as either a cold exercise in mechanical manipulation or as a tale of true determination and inspiration. The heroes are an unlikely pair of young athletes who ran for Great Britain in the 1924 Paris Olympics: devout Protestant Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson), a divinity student whose running makes him feel closer to God, and Jewish Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross), a highly competitive Cambridge student who has to surmount the institutional hurdles of class prejudice and anti-Semitism. There's delicious support from Ian Holm (as Abrahams's coach) and John Gielgud and Lindsay Anderson as a couple of Cambridge fogies. Vangelis's soaring synthesized score, which seemed to be everywhere in the early 1980s, also won an Oscar.Chariots of Firewas the debut film of British television commercial director Hugh Hudson (Greystoke) and was produced by David Puttnam.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002HRKVS", "B000VNMMQG", "B000KX0IOA", "B000068MC2", "B000FEB9DS", "B001A4YNPI", "B0002C9D9U", "B00DX88ISM", "B000001F28", "0792843592", "B0001FR0JS", "B002VWNIBI", "1860248411", "1618430157", "B0001GH7W2", "B000EXZFCQ", "6304712936", "B00003CXBH", "B00005AUKE", "B000KJTGHO", "B000LPR6GA", "B000JLFNIY", "6305428352", "B00004W221", "B0007SWPV2", "B00CZNSGDS", "B0068FZ0GK", "1572931302", "B000EXDS4I", "B006FE83UE", "B0001US66Y", "B000056VP4", "B00371QQ5M", "B0001US8F8", "B002HK9IDQ", "B00005JKF6", "B000K144OM", "B004GJYRI2", "B004SIP7F8", "B000RPCK2E", "B00011D1OU", "0783225733", "B006TTC5B8", "B00BTYJYR6", "B0009S4IKQ", "B004K6FS5W", "B00AMSM9CW", "6305144168", "B000XJD34I", "B0006GAO5Y", "B0071PT92C", "B000JJ5G24", "B003LMPKSQ", "B002VECM6S", "B000BCKFSE", "B000MNOX94", "B003WLVHFQ", "B002NZK5UK", "B0002JAP5E", "0060137428", "B00B0LKT9U", "B000CEXEWA", "B007N31YH0", "B0072GPQNG", "B009NNM9OA", "B001MVYUPC", "B001GWUHNQ", "B00005JPBO", "B0045HCIXG", "B005SYZYYK", "B00HUFCKB0", "B000FTCLSA", "B0006FYOTC", "B0000JBALO", "B00006ADD5", "B000BITV92", "B00AEBB9QY", "B00003CXBU", "B00004XPPC", "B0050FXDDQ", "B00EV4EUT8", "B00005AUKB", "6304907729", "B000BMY2LK", "0618562095", "1563713942", "B00066FBQG", "B002VWNIAY", "0783240171", "0440011493", "B000URDCC6"], "bought_together": ["B000VNMMQG", "B0002HRKVS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001A4YNPI", "B00DX88ISM", "B000068MC2", "B000VNMMQG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 56263}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "Warner", "asin": "0790731010", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513WMCSN21L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Chariots of Fire"}
{"description": "From its cleverly choreographed opening sequence to its heart-stopping climax on a rampant carousel, this 1951 Hitchcock classic readily earns its reputation as one of the director's finest examples of timeless cinematic suspense. It's not just a ripping-good thriller but a film student's delight and a perversely enjoyable battle of wits between tennis pro Guy (Farley Granger) and his mysterious, sycophantic admirer, Bruno (Robert Walker), who proposes a &quot;criss-cross&quot; scheme of traded murders. Bruno agrees to kill Guy's unfaithful wife, in return for which Guy will (or so it seems) kill Bruno's spiteful father. With an emphasis on narrative and visual strategy, Hitchcock controls the escalating tension with a master's flair for cinematic design, and the plot (coscripted by Raymond Chandler) is so tightly constructed that you'll be white-knuckled even after multiple viewings.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002HOEQ2", "B000CCW2SY", "B000ECX0O2", "B0045HCJ9E", "B00871C09S", "B0087ZG7R0", "B001D8W7EK", "B00000CQJZ", "B000A9QK7I", "B00AEBB97S", "B000CCW2TS", "B001D8W7F4", "B000ECX0Q0", "B0002HOEQM", "B001D8W7EU", "B0087ZG7OI", "B00000C0QO", "B002GSXKQA", "B000CCW2U2", "B0002HOER6", "B0087ZG7PW", "B000ECX0S8", "6305999872", "B00AEBB89C", "B003ZEQMH8", "B0002HOEQW", "B00004XPPK", "B000A1INJE", "B00008LDNZ", "B0002HOEQC", "B000CCW2UW", "B000FFJYA2", "B009RWRINE", "B000CCW2UC", "B0002HOEPS", "B0050FXDDQ", "B002VWNIAY", "B005EVY8MQ", "B0006HBV3C", "B0010YSD7W", "B00K6D1QV8", "B000025RE7", "B005H8G78O", "B000MGBSDK", "B007Y1NR1W", "B000PMFRVU", "B00005LC4D", "B0009ML1Z2", "B00065GX64", "B0045HCJQW", "B00AEBBA7W", "B00003CXBZ", "B000244F2S", "B0000549B1", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B008BFSMBA", "B000ECX0QU", "B000FFJYAW", "B004NWPY3E", "B00006RCO1", "B00005AUK9", "B0045HCJ8U", "B00AEFYO5I", "B0008ENIAC", "B00005JKF6", "B000CNE088", "B00DZP1C9K", "B00005RDRL", "B000UVV25Q", "B002945DUM", "B0045HCJHG", "B00AEFXD1O", "B0002ERWZ0", "078323502X", "B000KGGJ1I", "B00003CXBU", "B006TTC5WC", "B000KIX8VK", "B00000JNVC", "B00004W229", "B004CZRE44", "B00AEBB8OC", "B00AMEZDK6", "B000FFJYAC", "B006FE83UE", "B0007US7EY", "B0010AN7Z4", "B000CNE08I", "B0014Z4OMU", "B00553K8DQ", "B000B8380A", "B000244EYW", "B0009S4IKQ", "B00074DY0M", "B00004TJKI", "B005152C9G"], "bought_together": ["B0002HOEQ2", "B0045HCJ9E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00871C09S", "B0002HOEQ2", "B000CCW2SY", "B0045HCJ9E"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 124487}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.89, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "0790731029", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J4BhbK2UL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Strangers on a Train"}
{"description": "Stanley Kubrick'sThe Shiningis less an adaptation of Stephen King's bestselling horror novel than a complete reimagining of it from the inside out. In King's book, the Overlook Hotel is a haunted place that takes possession of its off-season caretaker and provokes him to murderous rage against his wife and young son. Kubrick's movie is an existential Road Runner cartoon (his steadicam scurrying through the hotel's labyrinthine hallways), in which the cavernously empty spaces inside the Overlook mirror the emptiness in the soul of the blocked writer, who's settled in for a long winter's hibernation. As many have pointed out, King's protagonist goes mad, but Kubrick's Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is Looney Tunes from the moment we meet him--all arching eyebrows and mischievous grin. (Both Nicholson and Shelley Duvall reach new levels of hysteria in their performances, driven to extremes by the director's fanatical demands for take after take after take.)The Shiningis terrifying--but not in the way fans of the novel might expect. When it was redone as a TV miniseries (reportedly because of King's dissatisfaction with the Kubrick film), the famous topiary-animal attack (which was deemed impossible to film in 1980) was there--but the deeper horror was lost. Kubrick'sThe Shininggets under your skin and chills your bones; it stays with you, inhabits you, haunts you. And there's no place to hide...--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300267881", "0790734079", "B00005ATQA", "6302038308", "6300182770", "B0009RRUKW", "0783235607", "0783228317", "B00000J2KZ", "B00004RNAC", "0790736039", "B00023NRSM", "6304508611", "6300182878", "6302921058", "6304509154", "0783216084", "6300214087", "B00004W5UA", "6301427076", "630268644X", "B000003KHS", "B000AMW2TK", "0790700506", "6300181340", "6300214753", "6302054982", "0784011923", "6305363668", "6303686796", "6305095566", "630021639X", "6302822688", "6305576173", "0783246641", "6304994540", "6303953425", "B00004U8PA", "0792158261", "0792100085", "6300213986", "6300189015", "630533577X", "6300214826", "0792846303", "6304288433", "6300147630", "0792842111", "B000007OY0", "0790741512", "6302158176", "0792846311", "6300183416", "0800103106", "B000005PFL", "6300183211", "0790733927", "6301666569", "6301871952", "0767825411", "630339406X", "6303109950", "6300216500", "6300214192", "6300262731", "6303257674", "6304214502", "630018627X", "6300214311", "1558807381", "0792839234", "0767819187", "B00005B238", "0790731975", "6303579388", "B000059HFB", "6302798450", "B00000FZCU", "6303651461", "6303566391", "6302642175", "6301971582", "6300218058", "6301094352", "6300184064", "6300181278", "6304457383", "6300214672", "6300262855", "0800125762", "6303257305"], "bought_together": ["0790734079"], "also_viewed": ["6300147630", "6300182878", "B00005ATQA", "6300189015", "6300267881", "B00023NRSM", "6300213005", "6303953425", "0307743659", "6303148352", "0790734079", "B001AQT0Z4", "6300183211", "0784011923", "B00BBND56G", "0788806270"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 268792}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0790705141", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5106FV0S4PL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Shining [VHS]"}

He accepts one last bounty-hunter mission--to find the men who brutalized a prostitute--to help support his two motherless children. Joined by his former partner (Morgan Freeman) and a cocky greenhorn (Jaimz Woolvett), he takes on a corrupt sheriff (Oscar winner Gene Hackman) in a showdown that makes the viewer feel the full impact of violence and its corruption of the soul.

{"description": "In the fourth and reportedly final film of theLethal Weaponseries, director Richard Donner reunites with Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, who reprise their roles as Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh for one last hurrah in a film that is decidedly better than the third and first chapters. This time the pair are pitted against Jet Li, who plays the leader of a Chinese  organized crime unit. Li, a veteran of hundreds of Hong Kong action films, more than holds his own against the more established team of Gibson, Glover, Renee Russo, and Joe Pesci with his subtle yet strong portrayal of the quietly irrepressible Wah Sing Ku. As always with theLethalseries, the plot is incredibly simple to follow: someone steals something, someone gets killed, and Murtaugh is reluctantly thrown into the mix while Riggs dives into the case with gleeful aplomb. As with the previous movies, we watch for the sheer action and chemistry alone. The action sequences throughout the fourth installment are exquisite, from the opening scene involving a flamethrower, a burning building, and a half-naked Murtaugh strutting like a chicken (don't ask, just watch), to the climactic showdown that pays genuine tribute to Jet Li's masterful martial art skills. As for chemistry, the bond between these characters is so strong by now that you sometimes feel like you're watching a TV series in its sixth season, such is the warm familiarity between the audience and the personalities on the screen. The humor is more fluid than ever, aided immeasurably by the casting of comedian Chris Rock, who like Li does a great job of making his presence known in some memorable verbal tirades that would bring a smile out of the Farrelly brothers. But it's the verbal and emotional jousting between Glover and Gibson that makes this fourth episode especially appealing; both are in peak form with great physical and verbal timing. One can only hope that if this is indeed the last of theLethalfilms, that it won't be the last time we see Glover and Gibson together on screen.--Jeremy Storey", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300271331", "6302596092", "6301572688", "6301017080", "B000U1ZV8K", "6304681496", "6304007523", "6302765536", "B00004XPQ6", "6302091632", "6304932553", "080010367X"], "bought_together": ["6300271331", "6302596092"], "also_viewed": ["6301572688", "6302596092", "6300271331"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 396077}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.18, "brand": "", "asin": "0790738945", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516WCCP833L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lethal Weapon 4"}

{"description": "Some critics complained thatCity of Angelscould never compare to Wim Wenders's exquisite German filmWings of Desire, which served as the later film's primary inspiration. The better argument to make is that any such comparisons are beside the point, becauseWings of Desirewas a much more deeply poetic, artfully contemplative film, whereasCity of Angelsis an enchanting product of mainstream Hollywood. Meg Ryan stars as Dr. Maggie Rice, a heart surgeon who is grieving over a lost patient when an angel named Seth (Nicolas Cage) appears to comfort her. She can see him despite the \"rule\" that angels are invisible, and Seth's love for Maggie forces him to choose between angelic immortality and a normal human existence on earth with her. Featuring heavenly roles for TV veterans Andre Braugher and Dennis Franz, the film liberally borrows imagery fromWings of Desire, but it also creates its own charming identity. Cage and Ryan give fine performances as lovers convinced they are soul mates, and although the plot relies on a last-minute twist that doesn't quite work, this earnest love story struck a chord with audiences and proved to be one of the surprise hits of 1998.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000062VP", "B002GIBVWA", "B00007GZR5", "B005F2JRUC", "0783233477", "B004SIP9RO", "B0000AOV4I", "6305692572", "B00AEFY4CG", "B000YDBPAM", "630471193X", "B004SIP8JI", "B000XJD33O", "B002IVDLGY", "B00008G7UF", "B002XTXGCK", "B00081U7HC", "0767810856", "B002GHHHNI", "B000HEWEE4", "B0000DIXDR", "B00AEBB8JM", "B003ASLJK4", "B00AEFYC96", "B000YAA68C", "B004SIP8LG", "B001HN69C2", "B002GOAGZC", "6304765266", "B0013D8LH2", "B0000A2ZO0", "B00AEBB8NS", "B000683VI4", "B002NZK5TQ", "B0017ANB08", "B00004Z4WR", "B0021L8V3Y", "B00AKGG6JS", "B000EHRVOW", "B00AEFY0F2", "6304711891", "6304806434", "B00006RCNY", "B00000IQW5", "B00000G3PA", "B00005NRO0", "0767811100", "B0009OL7Z4", "B000XT1P34", "B002K0WBXW", "B00AEBB9WI", "B00004W46I", "B005LAIGSM", "B00005JKZH", "6305428034", "B00AEFXT1S", "076784744X", "B004SIP9VA", "B000023VTP", "6305212112", "B0017ANAZO", "B00C6F61HS", "B00003CXL7", "B00004BZIY", "0783230079", "B0041KKYHE", "B002O3Z4WK", "B000P0J0DS", "B0045HCJJ4", "B000BBOUW2", "0800141849", "B000053VB5", "B003AWRMBA", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B00005BCKF", "B00012QLB4", "0792838068", "B0001Z3TXE", "B00005JA9F", "B00005JKIS", "B00006ZXSQ", "6305718954", "B00AEFXKUI", "B001LPWGGY", "B00000JGHK", "B0002WZTOI", "B000059TG6", "B002NZK5VO", "B000BYA5G4", "B00004TJKK", "B00866JL96", "B000ARTN3I", "B003L20IHE", "B00006ZXSN", "B00009WVSL", "B002NZK5V4", "6305236569", "B0006GANOQ", "B00004WG2F"], "bought_together": ["B00007GZR5"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000NA1WDQ", "B005F2JRUC", "0783233477", "B00007GZR5"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 81839}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "0790737345", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510332ZGT1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "City of Angels"}

{"description": "Saturday Night Feveris one of those movies that comes along and seems to change the cultural temperature in a flash. After the movie's release in 1977, disco ruled the dance floors, and a blow-dried member of a TV-sitcom ensemble became the hottest star in the country. For all that, the story is conventional: a 19-year-old Italian-American from Brooklyn, Tony Manero (John Travolta), works in a humble paint store and lives with his family. After dark, he becomes the polyester-clad stallion of the local nightclub; Tony's brother, a priest, observes that when Tony hits the dance floor, the crowd parts like the Red Sea before Moses. Director John Badham captures the electric connection between music and dance, and also the desperation that lies beneath Tony's ambitions to break out of his limited world. The soundtrack, which spawned a massively successful album, is dominated by the disco classics of the Bee Gees, including \"Staying Alive\" (Travolta's theme during the strutting opening) and \"Night Fever.\" The Oscar-nominated Travolta, plucked from the cast ofWelcome Back, Kotter, for his first starring role, is incandescent and unbelievably confident, and his dancing is terrific. Oh, and the white suit rules. (Note:Saturday Night Feverwas cut from its original R-rated version after its initial release in order to obtain a PG rating. The PG version is 11 minutes shorter and is missing parts of scenes and some street talk. Both versions are available on video.)--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300213668", "6300213978", "6304437250", "6300216993", "0790705141", "0783235607", "6302120101", "0792837614", "6300263673", "B00000JKNP", "6303182577", "6301977815", "6300214184", "6304508611", "630018403X", "6300271781", "0767825985", "0782008348"], "bought_together": ["6300213668"], "also_viewed": ["6300213668", "B000P6R6VK", "B00AMSLDUG", "B00APQLJOU", "6300213978"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 145081}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.98, "brand": "", "asin": "0792100085", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N6CXGG6EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Saturday Night Fever [VHS]"}
{"description": "Tautly directed and superbly photographed, this crowd-pleasing thriller from 1997 is indebted to Steven Spielberg'sDuel, but more closely resemblesDead Calmin its strengths and weaknesses. Kurt Russell plays a stressed-out husband whose wife (Kathleen Quinlan) disappears after their car breaks down in the desert. Tracking her whereabouts leads to an interstate theft and kidnapping ring, and as Russell pursues--and is pursued by--a vicious redneck played to perfection by J.T. Walsh (in one of his final film roles), the movie succumbs to several tense, but utterly conventional action sequences. That doesn't stop the movie from being an above-average nail-biter. It is so effectively directed by co-writer Jonathan Mostow that even the more surreal situations seem plausible and altogether unsettling. Russell's performance is key to the film's success--he's smart enough to be admirable, and we can readily identify with his frustration, confusion, and torment.

{"description": "A stupendous historical saga,Braveheartwon five Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director for star Mel Gibson. He plays William Wallace, a 13th-century Scottish commoner who unites the various clans against a cruel English King, Edward the Longshanks (Patrick McGoohan). The scenes of hand-to-hand combat are brutally violent, but they never glorify the bloodshed. There is such enormous scope to this story that it works on a smaller, more personal scale as well, essaying love and loss, patriotism and passion. Extremely moving, it reveals Gibson as a multitalented performer and remarkable director with an eye for detail and an understanding of human emotion. (His first directorial effort was 1993'sMan Without a Face.) The film is nearly three hours long and includes several plot tangents, yet is never dull. This movie resonates long after you have seen it, both for its visual beauty and for its powerful story.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004XPQ6", "B00003CXE6", "6303953425", "6304935811", "B0001VL30O", "B000054OW2", "6302415853", "0790741512", "6304071876", "6301792734", "6303168507", "6303942830", "0800125762", "6300183211", "B000007OY0", "B000056BRF", "6300214540", "B000065U6Q", "B00004WIDB", "B00003CXTF", "B00007KK15", "079070546X", "B0000A36J1", "B00000K3AN", "6302482712", "6300263673", "6305169187", "0788811355", "B00003BE3X", "0800116917", "6304414099", "6303020089", "0792133153", "0790744589", "6302909023", "0800132009", "079212569X", "6300185095", "6303313345", "0767819462", "6304259131", "B00000K2SC", "0800199421", "B0001DI5W6", "B00005JLTM", "630018224X", "0790701251", "6304151306", "6303696813", "0790731274", "0792147618", "B00005RIJ3", "6301586026", "6302945089", "0783223218", "6305718792"], "bought_together": ["B00004XPQ6", "B00003CXE6"], "also_viewed": ["0792151712", "6303314015", "6301966988", "6303402348", "B00004WIDB", "0792116887", "6300213668", "0800125762", "B00004XPQ6", "0792842111", "B00003CXTF", "0788812408", "6302526574", "6303215734", "0788806270", "6300183211", "B00004U8P4", "0788802194"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 256531}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.94, "brand": "", "asin": "079213690X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5109NVE2R9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Braveheart [VHS]"}

{"description": "Martin Scorsese's brutal black-and-white biography of self-destructive boxer Jake LaMotta was chosen as the best film of the 1980s in a major critics' poll at the end of the decade, and it's a knockout piece of filmmaking. Robert De Niro plays LaMotta (famously putting on 50 pounds for the later scenes), a man tormented by demons he doesn't understand and prone to uncontrollably violent temper tantrums and fits of irrational jealousy. He marries a striking young blond (Cathy Moriarty), his sexual ideal, and then terrorizes her with never-ending accusations of infidelity. Jake is as frightening as he is pathetic, unable to control or comprehend the baser instincts that periodically, and without warning, turn him into the rampaging beast of the title. But as Roman Catholic Scorsese sees it, he works off his sins in the boxing ring, where his greatest athletic talent is his ability to withstand punishment.

{"description": "David Lynch peeks behind the picket fences of small-town America to reveal a corrupt shadow world of malevolence, sadism, and madness. From the opening shots Lynch turns the Technicolor picture postcard images of middle class homes and tree-lined lanes into a dreamy vision on the edge of nightmare. After his father collapses in a preternaturally eerie sequence, college boy Kyle MacLachlan returns home and stumbles across a severed human ear in a vacant lot. With the help of sweetly innocent high school girl (Laura Dern), he turns junior detective and uncovers a frightening yet darkly compelling world of voyeurism and sex. Drawn deeper into the brutal world of drug dealer and blackmailer Frank, played with raving mania by an obscenity-shouting Dennis Hopper in a career-reviving performance, he loses his innocence and his moral bearings when confronted with pure, unexplainable evil. Isabella Rossellini is terrifyingly desperate as Hopper's sexual slave who becomes MacLachlan's illicit lover, and Dean Stockwell purrs through his role as Hopper's oh-so-suave buddy. Lynch strips his surreally mundane sets to a ghostly austerity, which composer Angelo Badalamenti encourages with the smooth, spooky strains of a lush score.Blue Velvetis a disturbing film that delves into the darkest reaches of psycho-sexual brutality and simply isn't for everyone. But for a viewer who wants to see the cinematic world rocked off its foundations, David Lynch delivers a nightmarish masterpiece.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304510861", "6303018351", "0790705141", "6300182770", "6302185882", "6303515304", "6300147630", "6304346158", "6300214044", "6302226899", "B000067DGJ", "B00004T37H", "0792839846", "630026999X", "0792846303", "6303422969", "0783229585"], "also_viewed": ["6302185882", "6300182770"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 325598}, "asin": "0792838084", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71W22ZVC1XL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Blue Velvet [VHS]"}
{"description": "Harry Hook's adaptation is not as faithful to the William Golding novel as you'd wish (they excised theLord of the Fliesdialogue with Simon!) and because of it, the movie is less allegorical and less resonant. A group of young men from a military academy are stranded on an island. The group quickly becomes fractious with a passive section led by Ralph, trying to get rescued, and a hunter faction, led by Jack, trying to procure meat and \"have fun.\" Peter Brook's 1963 filming seemed to get closer to the Darwinist sense of this cultural disintegration. Here, the hunter faction seems more like Peter Pan's Lost Boys than the bloodthirsty murderers they are. The performances, particularly young Getty, don't quite carry the weight of the situation. It's still, however, sobering to slowly watch the school uniforms traded for war paint, and the little boys turn into little savages.--Keith Simanton", "related": {"also_viewed": ["6302891256", "B001BEK8EW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 338425}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 17.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0792840941", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YZDPH135L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lord of the Flies [VHS]"}

{"description": "In the early '60s, nomadic single mom Mrs. Flax (Cher) packs up her two daughters, Charlotte (Winona Ryder) and Kate (Christina Ricci), in a beat-up Chevy wagon and moves to small-town Massachusetts. Preteen Kate is obsessed with swimming, while 15-year-old Charlotte is searching for ways to rebel against her mom (and mom's flirty ways). The route she chooses is to become fascinated with Catholicism and all its arcane rituals, even though the family is Jewish.  Her coming of age is handled with plenty ofWonder Years-style voiceovers as she fantasizes about Christ, the saints, the Pope, the Church--all things Catholic.  Cracks in her religious armor begin to appear, though, in the form of a hunky local guy (Michael Schoeffling) who works at the convent.  Meanwhile, her mom strikes up a romance with the town shoe-store proprietor, Lou (Bob Hoskins). Though Richard Benjamin's movie is a bit slow and tends to lose its focus somewhat in the last third,Mermaidsalso has fairly credible dialogue and surprisingly believable chemistry between Cher and Hoskins.  The segments dealing with JFK's assassination are handled particularly well, and while Ricci's role is a rather small one, she's charming nonetheless.  It's all too easy for coming-of-age movies to veer toward the maudlin, but thankfully this engaging comedy-drama seldom does. Cher, by the way, reprises her 1966 Sonny and Cher look, substituting a tight skirt and pumps for her turtleneck and fur vest.--Jerry Renshaw", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304509154"], "also_viewed": ["6301888901"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 175087}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.87, "brand": "", "asin": "0792842405", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517D8QQES4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mermaids [VHS]"}
{"description": "Eliot Asinof's detailed bookEight Men Outillustrates how the system of American sports collapsed in 1919, the year the Chicago White Sox threw the World Series. Filmmaker John Sayles worked on his script years before the 1988&nbsp;film (or before he had the rights to make the film) as a labor of love. Sayles's adaptation proves one can make a historically accurate film in the day and age of artistic license. And what a story. Although many know about the \"Black Sox,\" made famous--again--in the 1989 hit filmField of Dreams, the details of the saga are far less known. The center ofDreams, Shoeless Joe Jackson (portrayed correctly by D.B.&nbsp;Sweeney as illiterate and left-handed inEight), is not the core of this film; it's ace pitcher Eddie Cicotte (Sayles favorite David Strathairn), who took the money, and third baseman Buck Weaver (John Cusack), who did not. The film fits nicely into Sayles's (Lone Star) strong suit: the ensemble drama. We are introduced to bickering owners, famous crooks, high-minded judges, lowlife gangsters, investigative reporters (played by Studs Terkel and Sayles himself), and, most of all, players who are at the breaking point when it comes to low salaries and degrading rewards. While some may feel the film is not as visceral as it should be, there is a great amount of verisimilitude when watching finely tuned athletes telling their bodies to play poorly--heartbreak on the nation's diamond. Beautifully detailed (like Sayles's previous labor-drama,Matewan),Eight Men Outgives us powerful lessons in which everyone lost: players, gamblers, and especially the fans who love the game.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005M20M", "6302534372", "0767809262"], "bought_together": ["B00005M20M"], "also_viewed": ["B000003KMM", "B0000399WO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 448268}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.67, "brand": "", "asin": "0792841786", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GD6FM6ZVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Eight Men Out [VHS]"}

From sun-drenched panoramas to bold,hard close-ups, exceptional camera work captures the beauty and cruelty of the barren landscape andthe hardened characters who stride unwaveringly through it. Forging a vibrant and yet detached style of action that had not been seen before, and has never been matched since, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly shatters the western mold in true Clint Eastwood style.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792837312", "6304429711", "0790751216", "079284100X", "6300269043", "0790731975", "6300182452", "6300214826", "6302186161", "6300216500", "6300183211", "0792107128", "0783226152", "6305576173", "6302054982", "6303109950", "6304457278", "6300182533"], "bought_together": ["0792837312", "079284100X"], "also_viewed": ["0792837312", "0792158261", "6305363668", "6304429711", "0800116917", "B00005B238", "6300182576", "6300269043", "6300215830", "0790731975", "6300182533", "B00HZN8TBC", "079284100X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 400800}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0792842499", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HYPTT6ATL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly [VHS]"}

{"description": "FutureNightmarecreator andScreamweaver Wes Craven's  film debut is a primitive little production that rises above its cut-rate  production values and hazy, grainy patina via its grimly affecting portrait  of human evil infiltrating a middle-class household. The story is adapted  from Ingmar Bergman'sThe Virgin Spring, but the film has more in  common with Sam Peckinpah'sStraw Dogsas it charts the descent of a  harmless married couple into methodical killers. A quartet of criminals--a  distorted version of the nuclear family--kidnaps a pair of teenage girls and  proceeds to ravage, rape, torture, and finally brutally murder them in the  woods, unwittingly within walking distance of their rural home. The killers  take refuge in the girls' own home, but when the parents discover just who  they are and what they've done, they plot violent retribution.Along with George Romero'sNight of the Living Deadand Tobe Hooper'sTexas Chainsaw Massacre, Craven helped redefine American horror with  this debut--all three movies portray modern society crumbling into madness  and horror. But, unlike his fellow directors, Craven gives his film an  uncomfortable verisimilitude, setting it squarely in the heartland of modern  America. While at times it's awkward and inconsistent, with distracting comic  interludes, his handling of the brutal horror scenes is unsettling, and the  death of the daughter is an unexpectedly quiet and lyrical moment.--Sean  Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792839242", "6302921058", "B00000K0DU", "6300214311", "6300182770", "B00000IQUT"], "also_viewed": ["6302921058"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 475308}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.78, "brand": "", "asin": "079284632X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512ZWA7XGZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Last House on the Left [VHS]"}

The whole enterprise is a little too routine, but the action is sharp and the battles are imaginative and crisp.

{"description": "Director David Lean's masterful 1957 realization of PierreBoulle's novel remains a benchmark for war films, and a deeply absorbing movie by any standard--like most of Lean's canon,The Bridge on the River Kwaiachieves a richness in theme, narrative, and characterization that transcends genre.The story centers on a Japanese prison camp isolated deep in the jungles of Southeast Asia, where the remorseless Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) has been charged with building a vitally important railway bridge. His clash of wills with a British prisoner, the charismatic Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness), escalates into a duel of honor, Nicholson defying his captor's demands to win concessions for his troops. How the two officers reach a compromise, and Nicholson becomes obsessed with building that bridge, provides the story's thematic spine; the parallel movement of a team of commandos dispatched to stop the project, led by a British major (Jack Hawkins) and guided by an American escapee (William Holden), supplies the story's suspense and forward momentum.Shot on location in Sri Lanka,Kwaimoves with a careful, even deliberate pace that survivors of latter-day, high-concept blockbusters might find lulling--Lean doesn't pander to attention deficit disorders with an explosion every 15 minutes. Instead, he guides us toward the intersection of the two plots, accruing remarkable character details through extraordinary performances. Hayakawa's cruel camp commander is gradually revealed as a victim of his own sense of honor, Holden's callow opportunist proves heroic without softening his nihilistic edge, and Guinness (who won a Best Actor Oscar, one of the production's seven wins) disappears as only he can into Nicholson's brittle, duty-driven, delusional psychosis. His final glimpse of self-knowledge remains an astonishing moment--story, character, and image coalescing with explosive impact.Like Lean'sLawrence of Arabia,The Bridge on the River Kwaihas been beautifully restored and released in a highly recommended widescreen version that preserves its original aspect ratio.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302909023", "6304935811", "6304071876", "0800116917", "630150528X", "6301966317", "B0000040EJ", "6303168507", "0783222955", "6300181472", "0800113055", "0783221347", "6303057225", "6301797906", "0783235593", "6300181340", "6304151306", "6304196954", "6301965760", "B00005Q4GY", "6303494390", "6301977742", "6304291698", "6300988473", "6304117752", "6302797616", "B00007JME0", "630382336X", "0790752395", "B00005A1VH", "6301115430", "6300183513", "6302529441", "B000005PFL", "B00000F13T", "6304765347", "630274721X", "0782008348", "B000059HGY", "6301662954", "6300247031", "630018224X", "6301670140", "0792838408", "6304359675", "6304039522", "6300215601", "6304366078", "6300246965", "6300215539", "6303823351", "0800100832", "6301628454", "6300216721", "630407185X", "6304233639", "6300251152", "6300268748", "0790744589", "0790734060", "B00005Q4GZ", "0792116887", "6301798066", "0790701251", "6301976983", "6301972066", "B00004RFFA", "0800125762", "079212569X", "0792133153", "0790743213", "630442972X", "6301969049", "6300214540", "0783231482", "6300270025", "B00004TYS8", "6300183211", "6301587375", "B00000K3AN", "6300182533", "6301973259", "6304397941", "6301969251", "6300271315", "6303052223", "B00004RGUU", "0783235623", "B000062XM6", "6304458975", "B00004WIDB", "6305237115", "6301965701", "6302415853", "6303029027", "B000005PE7", "B0001DI5W6", "0792837533", "6301662946"], "bought_together": ["6302909023", "6301966317"], "also_viewed": ["0790743213", "6304071876", "B00BBND56G", "B000059HH1", "6305123616", "630233683X", "0783222955", "0783221347", "6304039522", "6300183513", "B000054OW2", "1558803602", "6301662954"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 223097}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0800132009", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PF507DBSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Bridge on the River Kwai [VHS]"}

{"description": "Overview\nFormer vice president Al Gore shares his concerns on the pressing issue of global warming in this documentary. A long-time environmental activist, Gore first became aware of evidence on global warming in the 1970s, and since leaving public office he has become a passionate advocate for large- and small-scale changes in our laws and lifestyles that could help alleviate this crisis. An Inconvenient Truth records a multi-media presentation hosted by Gore in which he discusses the scientific facts behind global warming, explains how it has already begun to affect our environment, talks about the disastrous consequences if the world's governments and citizens do not act, and shares what each individual can do to help protect the Earth for this and future generations. An Inconvenient Truth was directed by Davis Guggenheim, a veteran documentary filmmaker who also has an extensive background in episodic television.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JPXA", "B0013D8LHM", "B0027BOL4G", "0670062723", "B004IN75D0", "B0042EJD8A", "B00018U8YE", "B000YKI4MM", "B00147F8WS", "B0012Q3T72", "B0002OXVBO", "B000UNYJXQ", "B003M987AG", "1594865671", "B000I5Y8FU", "B001C17EVE", "B00005JMXX", "B001MWGZ6S", "B002PLMJ74", "B00366E1AK", "B001EP8EOY", "B000BTH4K4", "B000RPCJSE", "B002RB56W2", "B001EUSYHQ", "B0019KAQB8", "B004SO26RE", "B000BI5KV0", "B005OCJJ9M", "B002RX8G5E", "B005YFGIZM", "B000PY52IG", "B0041KKYBA", "B00AZMFNX2", "B001KWB0L0", "B003FNQ0I0", "B0069UP2PI", "0812982894", "B003Q6D28W", "0674058178", "B000BJS4FS", "B003Q6D28C", "1405187360", "B005YFGIZ2", "B0019A35G6", "B000OUCEZU", "B005ZMBDJK", "1594867348", "B00FGVS0DM", "B000MQ4WX8", "B005TZFZK6", "0312428928", "B0053ZHZI2", "B0055V6EX6", "B008NNY98U", "0767805712", "B00APG8QQO", "1586481983", "B002KLALEC", "B00DPUB5LK", "B003GSLVX8", "B00AEFXPSK", "B001E0KSAM", "B008LW2520", "B0009GX1EM", "B000WLUXZE", "B003CAKXAC", "B000CPHAAG", "B00IWULQQ2", "1931930007", "B00EL6AAEU", "B00013F2S6", "B005LAIH4A", "B000B0WO4O", "B006ZAPSJW", "B000EOTEM2", "0521732557", "B0007DBJM8", "B0018PH3NI", "B00CMDPTA4", "B004JR3OKI", "B00744WZ8U", "B0025XUTKQ", "B001M0N8UQ", "B0040QYRS6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JPXA", "B0027BOL4G", "0670062723", "B004SO26RE"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 50499}, "asin": "1415724784", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51p%2Btk39UpL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "An Inconvenient Truth"}

{"description": "Some people collect stamps, cigar bands or teacups.  Jonathan saves memories of family:  photos, cards, false teeth, handfuls of dirt - all sealed in individual bags and mounted on a wall.  Now Jonathan seeks a more elusive memory  He'll journey to the Ukraine to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis in 1942.\n\nLiev Schreiber (Scream, RKO 281) makes his debut on the other side of the camera, directing and adapting (from Jonathan Safran Foer's novel) an affecting road movie.

{"description": "Fully aware of its status as the sequel to the surprise hit thriller of 1996, this lively follow-up trades freshness for familiarity, playing on our affection for returning characters while obeying--and then subverting--the \"rules\" of sequels. Once again, movie references are cleverly employed to draw us into the story, which takes place two years after the events ofScream, at a small Ohio college, where theScreamsurvivors reunite when another series of mysterious killings begins. Capitalizing on the guesswork involving a host of potential suspects, director Wes Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson have crafted a thriller that's more of aScreamclone than a genuinely inventive new story. But the shocks are just as effective, and escalating tension leads to a tautly staged climax that's simultaneously logical and giddily over the top. Background information for trivia buffs: to preserve the secrecy of plot twists, copies of the screenplay were heavily guarded during production and restricted to only the most crucial personnel. When an early draft was circulated on the Internet, screenwriter Kevin Williamson did rewrites, and subsequent drafts were printed with red ink on brown paper, eliminating the threat of photocopying. None of the cast members knew who the killer was until the final scenes were filmed!--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SIP9P6", "B004SIP9MY", "B004LWZW2O", "6305017115", "6305300801", "B004SIP9E2", "B004P7CNUY", "B004SIP9I8", "B00AEFY2WI", "B00005LC4Q", "B00AEFY2LO", "B00AEFY31S", "B00AEFY37C", "0780631684", "B00AEFY1V0", "0767824954", "B000A5045Q", "B000FA57UI", "B004P7CM9Q", "B0000VCZMK", "B004EPZ08O", "B000FA57US", "B00006FI0R", "B00AEFY2AA", "B001NPD9LS", "B001B1UO6W", "B00AEFY2E6", "B000VKL6Z2", "B004P7CN7W", "B000FOQ1KY", "B00005JLZK", "0783232039", "B004SIP9KQ", "B0000AOX09", "B001GCUO4S", "B000RIWAVW", "B00006FDBT", "B00AEFYYH6", "B002ZG971U", "B000FC2HS6", "B005CFC0N8", "0783230451", "B0053TWVDC", "B001L9EXUC", "B00BM4Q4H6", "B00105303S", "B00CAATSME", "B000FSME9W", "B003Q6D27S", "B000LC3ID8", "B0000AOX08", "B000CRR31U", "B00275EHFU", "B0000E2R6P", "B0056P6SOG", "B00006LPHA", "B00JQF7ZR6", "B00005RHGK", "B001DJLD0S", "B00018D42W", "B0000541TL", "B00005JMDZ", "B00DTPRZ10", "B000I2J736", "0780630890", "B00004W4UD", "B00J81S92S", "B00005JND2", "B000069I05", "B000KJU1KK", "B001DJLD1W", "B002XD0J80", "B002YICNE2", "0780630904", "B0000D9PNG", "0792840127", "B000Q66Q2O", "B0021L8UXA", "B008JFUNYG", "0780624890", "B0006SSOHC", "B002G1WPG8", "B000GETUDI", "B000RGN2JI", "B00001PE4D", "B000TJBN62", "B00003CWRF", "B00EZ50SGW", "B000P0J06U", "B000I2J68M", "B000099T3M", "B00005JKWJ", "B00AGKH4MG", "B000FS9FE4", "B00GDDNFDW", "B00B96TGQS", "B00000F0AD", "1573628174", "B000AM4P9K", "B0000VCZNE"], "bought_together": ["B004SIP9P6", "B004SIP9MY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005CFBYW6", "B004SIP9MY", "B004LWZW2O", "B004SIP9P6"]}, "price": 2.45, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 253003}, "asin": "1558908498", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41xjwcKMvhL.jpg", "title": "Scream 2"}
{"description": "Filming onBlood for Draculabegan on location in Italy on the same day that filming ofFlesh for Frankensteinended, and knowing this enhances one's appreciation of director Paul Morrissey's delightfully twisted--and defiantly artistic--approach to violent, campy horror. Originally titledAndy Warhol's FrankensteinandAndy Warhol's Dracula, both films are blessed by Morrissey's opulent visual style (he and his Italian cinematographer worked wonders with modest budgets), and both showcase Udo Kier and the languorous hunk Joe Dallesandro in opposing roles. Here we find Udo Kier as Count Dracula, looking even more ashen than usual and desperate for the blood of virgins to restore his waning health. He travels to Italy and stays at the fading estate of a once-wealthy family, and the presence of four lovely, sexually inexperienced daughters turns out to be a recipe for disaster. It so happens that only the youngest daughter is actually a virgin, and by process of elimination Dracula discovers that non-virgin blood makes him violently ill! Dallesandro plays the resident handyman--handy in more ways than one, as the daughters have learned--who dares to protect the remaining virgin from the Count's bloodsucking exploits, and as usual director Morrissey finds ample opportunity to combine sex and gore with outrageous sensibility and logic of plot. As in the case ofFlesh for Frankenstein, this Criterion Collection DVD restores the film to its original director's cut, presented in its original aspect ratio with a supplemental commentary by Morrissey, Kier, and critic Maurice Yacowar. Kier is particularly delightful, observing during one gruesome scene that \"vomiting looks great when you've got a tuxedo on.\"--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000A59Q4G", "B00004ZBVO", "B00005N7Z1", "B00HVOFP6W", "B0046ZYEVG", "B004ALIG1U", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B00180R06I", "B0001ZIYDO", "B00GOT15IM", "0780022629", "B004ALIG4W", "B000B9E2M2", "B00GPPXP6A", "B0009298N4", "B00IO9J5XW", "B002MZZTE8", "B003ELKNO0", "B00IA1VKVY", "B00HW3EZXQ", "6305922756", "B008HSK3PE", "B0007WFYC0", "B00004Z1FM", "B000059H7Q", "B0000AKY56", "B0019X400I", "B0002KVULG", "B000VUQ4HW", "B0000633SC", "B00FUABJJQ", "B008Y5OXDI", "B00005JKPT", "B001CW7ZSA", "B004ALIG4M", "B00005EBSB", "B00004W3HG", "B0013D8L7M", "B00FUABHVQ", "B00005QAPJ", "B004ALIG0G", "B000BZN1LO", "B00000IOKV", "B001WLMOHI", "0780023161", "B007ZFSBWW", "1559408677", "B0019X3ZZO", "B00HE010QM", "B008FL8OTK", "B00GBT62PQ", "B00AWWX8YG", "1559409053", "B0026VBOJ2", "B001WLMOOG", "B00B2BYXTK", "B00005B1ZK", "B003N2CVRC", "B00K5EJHGO", "B000R7I48G", "0780020707", "B000S0GYRU", "B001BEK8F6", "B00008RH15", "B00008H2GS", "B004NWPY1Q", "B00005NFZA", "B00BCGUJ5M", "B005D0RDNY", "B0000542CO", "B003JSSPUM", "B00008YOFG", "B000PMFRZQ", "B000HT3QBO", "B0002KPHZG", "B0002RQ3M0", "0780021541", "B00DMUFXOS", "B000HT3QBE", "B000BC8SWE", "B00F98FOI6", "B006X64S7Q", "B008MPQ0G8", "B00I3C1T1Q", "B00AEBBA9U", "B00009AV90", "B00I3C1T34", "B009D004X6", "B000E6EK60", "6305071470", "6305808163", "B0006HC00A", "B001CCY44S", "B0013LL2UC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000A59Q4G", "B00J2JISK4", "B000IJ7A5Q", "B00EO2I6OM"]}, "price": 18.09, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 209566}, "asin": "1559408944", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71EKATGKYYL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Blood for Dracula (The Criterion Collection)"}
{"description": "Robert Bresson drew inspiration from Dostoevsky'sCrime and Punishmentfor this examination of an arrogant young pickpocket who deems himself above the laws and conditions of ordinary men. Michel (Martin LaSalle), a rather bland-looking young man with a perpetually blank face, haunts the subways, city streets, and racetracks to ply his trade. He plays a game of wits with a fatherly police inspector and walls his heart off from the affections of a quiet young woman, Jeanne (Marika Green), who looks after his dying mother. Bresson's direction of his \"models\" (as he calls his nonprofessional performers) strips them of affectation and motivation, making them blank slates defined by the accumulation of precisely drilled actions and words.Pickpocketis no thriller, though Bresson offers impressive, meticulously detailed scenes of daring and intimate robberies (one sequence on a subway feels like an homage to Sam Fuller'sPickup on South Street). Rather, it is a powerful, profound search for meaning and spiritual enlightenment by a man who believes in nothing but himself, and many critics consider it Bresson's masterpiece.

Soderbergh himself stars as two people--one an ineffective dentist, the other a speechwriter for a cult movement called Eventualism, which has set out to \"question all answers\"--connected by their romances with the same woman, played by Soderbergh's real-life ex, Betsy Bramley. There isn't so much a story as a series of bits in which these characters often (though not necessarily) turn up, from press conferences on the subject of horse urination to old footage of nudists to a scene of an Eventualist exchange between husband and wife: \"Generic greeting!\" \"Generic greeting returned!\" None of this leads to a literal point, but after a while an undercurrent of disease about making sense of the modern world becomes apparent beneath the jokes. Soderbergh (sex, lies, and videotape,Out of Sight) is certainly a filmmaker who goes his own way in life, always hitting his target in one spot or another and occasionally getting a bull's-eye for his trouble.Schizopolisis no bull's-eye, and it has just as many detractors as admirers, but it's impossible not to appreciate Soderbergh's conviction that making a film out on the fringes is a worthy endeavor.--Tom Keogh", "price": 19.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 581785}, "asin": "1572521481", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RK6ZGMACL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Schizopolis [VHS]"}

{"description": "This gentle, modern-day fairy tale explores a family trying to recover from a father's death. Katie is a combative 12-year-old; her brother Simon is almost mute; their mother desperately needs time to rebuild her life. She takes the kids to visit their dad's mother in Newfoundland where Grandmother Lydia (played with grounded depth by Marsha Mason) tells Katie she understands that she has \"to stay angry or you'll forget him.\" Lydia says that \"some people have the gift of seeing,\" and Katie and Simon prove her right when they meet Charles Nungesser and Fran&ccedil;ois Coli, historical French aviation heroes who disappeared trying to beat Lindbergh across the Atlantic in 1927. These lost souls repeat their fateful crash into the swamp every time the fog comes in. Katie realizes they must finish the flight to enable their escape to heaven and begins the improbable task of raising their plane from the deep. The antagonistic relationship of the aristocratic and pompous Nungesser and his kindly navigator is portrayed with picaresque charm by the charismatic Lothaire Bluteau and the humanistic Michel Monty. Nungesser bemoans being beaten by a \"mailman,\" while Coli mourns the loss of his wife and child. ResurrectingL'Oiseau Blanchelps Katie interact positively with people and develop friendships.

For those new to the Marx Brothers, this is the perfect introduction to Groucho, Chico, and Harpo (and even Zeppo), three of the funniest men to ever grace the screen. Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho) is the dictator of the small nation Freedonia. The country is a disaster, in financial disrepair, and the wealthy Mrs. Teasdale (Margaret Dumont) is its benefactor and the object of Firefly's shrewd affection. When the leader of the neighboring Sylvania decides he's in love with Mrs. Teasdale, Firefly declares war. The movie, from 1933, is tremendously satirical, a play on politics and war. (As Firefly says to a hapless young solider, \"You're a brave man. Go and break through the lines. And remember, while you're out there risking your life and limb through shot and shell, we'll be in be in here thinking what a sucker you are.\") Full of witty lines, great sight gags, and even some snazzy song numbers (\"Freedonia's Going to War\" is the hilarious declaration of battle), this is surely one of the best--if notthebest--the Marx Brothers have to offer.--Jenny Brown", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301221494", "6300181243", "6301965965", "6300184072", "B0000040EK", "6301337999", "B004P9UWLY", "1558807780", "6301976126", "0790743213", "6301963911", "0783221347"], "bought_together": ["6301221494", "6300181243"], "also_viewed": ["B0000040EK", "B004P9UWKA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 314000}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.49, "brand": "", "asin": "6300181367", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51713HWP6QL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Duck Soup [VHS]"}
{"description": "After several years as the hottest musical director on Broadway, Bob Fosse made his film directorial debut with this movie version of his Broadway hit, which was based on Fellini'sNights of Cabiria. Shirley MacLaine is terrific as the proverbial hooker with the heart of gold, one who is convinced that she will find the right man if she just turns enough tricks. The Cy Coleman score is a solid one; the film is at its best when Fosse lets his cast of singer-dancers (which includes Chita Rivera, Paula Kelly, and Sammy Davis Jr.) unleash his leggy brand of choreography.

All the Glenn Miller classics filling the soundtrack make the film pretty easy to take, too: \"Moonlight Serenade,\" \"A String of Pearls,\" \"Chattanooga Choo-Choo.\" Miller plays the great \"In the Mood\" with his military band during a World War II air-raid warning.

{"description": "An experimental film masquerading as a standard Hollywood thriller. The plot ofRopeis simple and based on a successful stage play: two young men (John Dall and Farley Granger) commit murder, more or less as an intellectual exercise. They hide the body in their large apartment, then throw a dinner party. Will the body be discovered? Director Alfred Hitchcock, fascinated by the possibilities of the long-take style, decided to shoot this story as though it were happening in one long, uninterrupted shot. Since the camera can only hold one 10-minute reel at a time, Hitchcock had to be creative when it came time to change reels, disguising the switches as the camera passed behind someone's back or moved behind a lamp. In later years Hitchcock wrote off the approach as misguided, andRopemay not be one of Hitchcock's top movies, but it's still a nail-biter. They don't call him the Master of Suspense for nothing. James Stewart, as a suspicious professor, marks his first starring role for Hitchcock, a collaboration that would lead to the masterpiecesRear WindowandVertigo.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783221347", "6300183513", "0783236352", "6300181340", "0783235593", "6301670140", "0783235623", "1558807780", "0790743213", "6300215741", "0783235607", "0783235682", "6304039530", "6302909023", "6301798503", "6301670159", "B0002IXSVI", "6300181537", "0783235704", "0792837649", "0783236344", "0783235674", "0783235615", "1558808590", "B00000FZXC", "B00007JME0", "630150528X", "6300183912", "6300208133", "6305282927", "6302360978", "6301798732", "6304359721", "6303631851", "6305012792", "B000003KE0", "6300268594", "6302797667", "6301647734", "6300270386", "0782008348", "6302779782", "6301975987", "6301586026", "B00004R67T", "B00005LMA7", "B00003OSTO", "6303962068", "6303333079", "B0000040EO", "6305123616", "0792107683", "6302374227", "0800100832", "6300181723"], "bought_together": ["0783221347", "6300183513"], "also_viewed": ["0783235593", "0783236352", "6302360978", "0790743213", "B0009LK9E2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 355703}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6300183580", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VP74Y7BVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rope [VHS]"}
{"description": "At the time of its original release in 1984, this modestly budgeted sci-fi excursion had the distinction of offering some of the first examples of purely computer-generated animation, an apt (and frugal) special-effects solution for a movie with a plot line rooted in computer games. Both the computer-generated visuals and the arcade game now look quaint, but writer-director Nick Castle's affable, good- hearted adventure holds up nicely, thanks to a clever premise--the title game is actually a test for prospective starship pilots, planted by embattled aliens under siege from an evil invader. When a restless teenager (Lance Guest) racks up an impressive score, he finds himself spirited away to the besieged planet and thrust into the midst of an intergalactic war. Apart from Castle's skill at contrasting his extraterrestrial settings with the mundane details of his hero's earthbound life, the movie gets lift-off from two thorough pros, Robert Preston, who makes the alien recruiter, Centauri, a planet-hopping cousin toThe Music Man's Harold Hill, and Dan O'Herlihy, the alien copilot, who suggests a scaly Walter Brennan. Older fans will snicker, but kids and young teens will find this rite of passage absorbing, while their folks will savor Preston's brash charm.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302814782", "6302642256", "6300248100", "0792841778", "6300184269"], "bought_together": ["6302642256"], "also_viewed": ["6300213005", "6304718551", "B00004TWZK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 283762}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.84, "brand": "", "asin": "6300183483", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y7HZ8YX5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Last Starfighter [VHS]"}

Aided by a tenacious beauty (Caitlin Clarke) and his resurrected mentor (Ralph Richardson), Galen confronts the soaring beast in a breathtaking climax.

Good support from Judge Reinhold and John Ashton as local cops not used to doing things the Detroit way (Murphy's character hails from the Motor City). Paul Reiser has a funny, brief moment at the beginning, and Bronson Pinchot makes a hilarious impression in a great, never-to-be-duplicated scene with the star.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000003KDD", "6303248209", "6301792769", "6300271331", "6301208773", "6301888901", "6300213005", "6302765536", "630018224X", "B0002XNSYA", "0780623711", "0792133153", "0792153189", "630300394X"], "bought_together": ["B000003KDD", "6303248209"], "also_viewed": ["B000003KDD", "0792151712", "B000062XM6", "630339406X", "6301217977"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 369040}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6300213730", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NZ46CHK1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Beverly Hills Cop [VHS]"}
{"description": "This minor 1955 work by Alfred Hitchcock, one of the lighter entries of his creative peak in the 1950s, is still imbued with the master's stock themes of shared guilt and romantic ambivalence. It is also hardly lacking in Hitchcockian cinematic inventiveness, such as a famous, often-imitated sequence in which some smooching between stars Cary Grant and Grace Kelly is intercut with a fireworks show that just happens to be going on outside in a Riviera setting. Grant plays a reformed cat burglar who is suspected of reviving his trade, though he knows someone else is using his old methods. A very enjoyable experience, but don't get this confused with Hitchcock's other Cary Grant film of that decade, which was a masterpiece:North by Northwest.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790743213", "6300183513", "0783221347", "0783235593", "B0000040EO", "6304039530", "6300181529", "6302227127", "6300215717", "079284517X", "6305123616", "0782006779", "6301798503", "0792839846", "6304457383", "6300183580", "630233683X", "0782006809", "0780614097", "6302484448", "6300215628", "6301670140", "0793910323", "6301586026", "630299005X", "6302413435", "6303102441", "6301670159", "0783235607", "6300215733", "0792837649", "6300181472", "630266232X", "6304117752", "0783235615", "6300215512", "6304383827", "6300158438", "B000059HH1", "0800100832", "6300215644", "0782008348", "6300215962", "6300216500", "0792837614", "B00004TRD5", "B000056BRF", "B000055Y0Y", "B00005ALP2", "6305718792", "6301964012", "6302363268", "B0045HCJ9E", "6300214028", "6304359705", "0792107683", "0783236352", "6304259131", "6302636779", "1558807780", "B000006N70", "6301734734", "B00004RFFA", "6301978315", "6301647734", "630018157X", "B00000I1EM", "6302909023", "6300215660", "6300213676", "6303631851", "B000EO7AIC", "6303082866", "630442972X", "6300181405", "6302700949", "0792845684", "6300215814", "6303364772", "B000021Y6K", "6302800897", "B00004RV8M", "6302800420", "6300214699", "6300216721", "6301797957", "6301965701", "6305122725", "0783226152", "B000BWIZRW", "0790733935", "6305012792", "6303908306", "6302098424", "6301045750", "6302278929", "6303192254", "6303562248", "6302736951"], "bought_together": ["0790743213", "6300183513"], "also_viewed": ["6304117752"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 239511}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.98, "brand": "", "asin": "6300215741", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C7XND430L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "To Catch a Thief [VHS]"}

{"description": "Francis Ford Coppola took some of the deep background from the life of Mafia chief Vito Corleone--the patriarch of Mario Puzo's bestselling novelThe Godfather--and built around it a stunning sequel to his Oscar-winning, 1972 hit film. Robert De Niro plays Vito as a young Sicilian immigrant in turn-of-the-century New York City's Little Italy. Coppola weaves in and out of the story of Vito's transformation into a powerful crime figure, contrasting that evolution against efforts by son Michael Corleone to spread the family's business into pre-Castro Cuba. As memorable as the first film is,The Godfather IIis an amazingly intricate, symmetrical tragedy that touches upon several chapters of 20th-century history and makes a strong case that our destinies are written long before we're born. This was De Niro's first introduction to a lot of filmgoers, and he makes an enormous impression. But even with him and a number of truly brilliant actors (including maestro Lee Strasberg), this is ultimately Pacino's film and a masterful performance.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000003KHS", "6302158176", "6300183211", "B0019L21H4", "6300214826", "6303686796", "6303168507", "0782008348", "6303471501", "0790705141", "0790733927", "6303402070", "B00003CXE6", "B000056BRF", "6300267997", "6300181340", "B0001VL30O", "6301977815", "6305363668", "0800132009", "6304508611", "B00005B238", "6300182878", "0792845684", "6302226899", "B00005Q4GZ", "0800100832", "6304429274", "B0000A36J1"], "bought_together": ["B000003KHS", "6302158176"], "also_viewed": ["B000NTPDSW", "B0019L770A", "B000003KHS", "6302158176", "6302610702", "6300183211", "0792174909", "B00EN09FKO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 228315}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.9, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "630021639X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41807N7YNFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Godfather, Part II [VHS]"}

Particularly if you add in Albert Finney as Christie's delightfully persnickety sleuth, Hercule Poirot. Someone has knocked off nasty Richard Widmark on this train trip and, to Poirot's puzzlement, everyone seems to have a motive--just the setup for a terrific whodunit. Though it seems like an ensemble film, director Sidney Lumet gives each of his stars their own solo and each makes the most of it. Bergman went so far as to win an Oscar for her role.

{"description": "The wartime memories of surviving World War II bomber squadrons were still crystal clear when this acclaimed drama was released in 1949--one of the first postwar films out of Hollywood to treat the war on emotionally complex terms. Framed by a postwar prologue and epilogue and told as a flashback appreciation of wartime valor and teamwork, the film stars Gregory Peck in one of his finest performances as a callous general who assumes command of a bomber squadron based in England. At first, the new commander has little rapport with the 918th Bomber Group, whose loyalties still belong with their previous commander. As they continue to fly dangerous missions over Germany, however, the group and their new leader develop mutual respect and admiration, until the once-alienated commander feels that his men are part of a family--men whose bravery transcends the rigors of rigid discipline and by-the-book leadership. The film's now-classic climax, in which the general waits patiently for his squad to return to base--painfully aware that they may not return at all--is one of the most subtle yet emotionally intense scenes of any World War II drama. With Peck in the lead and Dean Jagger doing Oscar-winning work in a crucial supporting role, this was one of veteran director Henry King's proudest achievements, and it still packs a strong dramatic punch.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301736362", "0792838556", "6301977289", "6302224462", "B00000F13T", "B00005Q4GY", "6302226899", "6300246965", "0783226152", "6303057225", "B0007TKNGA", "B0001WTWWE", "6300181472", "0792116887", "B0001NBMH6", "B00AEFYBA6", "0792837959", "6301967593", "B00005PJ8S", "6302909023", "6301979761", "0790733390", "6301798503", "B00005A1VH", "6303562248", "6301976924", "1558807780", "B0072GPQNG", "6300208281", "630299005X", "6304196954", "6302360978", "6301662954", "0782006779", "6300268748", "0800132009", "6302862906", "6302227135", "6304457316", "6302756472", "6301798708", "6301734734", "B000006N70", "630021639X", "6301564456", "6301976622", "6304071876", "6300246868", "0800100832", "0792102320", "B000M7BEPQ", "6302413435", "6301967410", "6300185192", "6303491006", "6301978390", "6301802330", "6300269795", "6304458975", "6300216217", "6302208912", "6302308208", "B000BWIZTU", "6303120474"], "bought_together": ["6301977289", "6301736362"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 322550}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.89, "brand": "", "asin": "6300247090", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MXD828JFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Twelve O'Clock High [VHS]"}

{"description": "This harrowing but rewarding 1984 drama concerns the real-life relationship between New York Times reporter Sidney Schanberg and his Cambodian assistant Dith Pran (Haing S. Ngor), the latter left at the mercy of the Khmer Rouge after Schanberg--who chose to stay after American evacuation but was booted out--failed to get him safe passage. Filmmaker Roland Joff&eacute;, previously a documentarist, made his feature debut with this account of Dith's rocky survival in the ensuing madness of the Khmer Rouge's genocidal campaign. The script spends some time with Schanberg's feelings of guilt after the fact, but most of the movie is a shattering re-creation of hell on Earth. The late Haing S. Ngor--a real-life doctor who had never acted before and who lived through the events depicted by Joff&eacute;--is outstanding, and he won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Oscars also went to cinematographer Chris Menges and editor Jim Clark.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["0786713151", "B00004XPPC", "B000BO1MY8", "6302859204", "6301115430", "B000CS45Z6", "6301964365", "6303471587", "6303100864"]}, "price": 14.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 254616}, "asin": "6300270548", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q7XKX1CWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Killing Fields [VHS]"}
{"description": "Based upon T.H. White's beloved novel, this Disney-fied version chronicles the tutoring of the Once and Future King, Arthur, as handled by the magician Merlin.Swordwas a portent of things to come, with slapstick upbraiding storytelling, and cultural in-jokes substituting for wonder. But there's much to enjoy here as Merlin shows Newt, the young Arthur, things that will help him become the ruler of the Britons. The transformation sequences, where the boy is turned into a fish, a bird, and a squirrel are vintage Disney. The oft-repeated scene of Merlin battling it out with the mean old Madame Mim still is worth a few chuckles, but it belies the problem with most of the film--the scenes are only there for the chuckles. References by Merlin to television and other items of modern life also mar the generally innocuous landscape.

{"description": "When Roman tribune Marcellus Gallio (Richard Burton) is sent to Jerusalem, one of his assignments is the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Marcellus, a cynical and hardened man, wins the robe Jesus wore to the crucifixion while gambling with other Roman soldiers underneath the dying savior. He later becomes convinced that his hallucinations and violent outbursts are the result of a curse received from the robe, which is now in the possession of his escaped slave, Demetrius (Victor Mature), somewhere in the Middle East. He sets out to find Demetrius in order to destroy the robe and the curse and finds faith instead, converting to Christianity. This was the first movie to be filmed in CinemaScope, and won Oscars in 1953 for costume design, art direction, and set decoration. The visual aspects of the film are stunning, and it may be worth viewing for that alone; however, the script and acting leave much to be desired, and you won't find inspiration in these areas if that's what interests you. If, however, you are more interested in this film for its religious matter, the story of the conversion of the hardened Marcellus is inspiring.--James McGrath", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301976622", "6300215830", "B000056BRF", "B00004CIOV", "B00005NKW1", "6300216012", "B000056AXZ", "B000059HH1", "6303282237", "6301969251", "6302797640", "0790758474", "6301959728", "6301412796", "0783226039", "B000054OW2", "0005166004", "B00014K5V4", "6302354110", "6304140908", "B0074JOUHE", "6301628667", "6305123616", "6301412788", "6301628632", "6302643627", "6301412702", "B0006GANX2", "0792837533", "6301964306", "6303257828", "630361633X", "0782008941", "0800132009", "0800116917", "0800100832", "6300182304", "0784001804", "6302120624", "6301977815", "6302962048", "6304291698", "6302464889", "6302098424", "0783235593", "0005119359", "6300267938", "6301805615", "0792845684", "6300183890", "6304508611", "079212569X", "079284517X", "6301670140", "6300246965", "0783235607", "B00028HBL6", "6304071876", "6300247031", "6301972236", "630266232X", "630018627X", "0783215096", "6300181111", "6301578805", "630434256X", "6303396623", "B00000GVF7", "6301977149", "6302413435", "6304504012", "B000062XM6", "630467306X", "6301798759", "B00000493Q", "0790752395", "6303039693", "B000M5BRX2", "6304112262", "0792838556", "0788811355", "6302990130", "0782008348", "6301798961", "6302909023", "6302256682", "6300182908", "6301969316"], "bought_together": ["6301976622", "B000056BRF"], "also_viewed": ["B0002BO05S", "B0000040EJ", "6300215830"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 267582}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6301628454", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516XYACA3BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Robe [VHS]"}

{"description": "Ranking No. 21 on the American Film Institute's list of the 100 greatest American films, this 1940 classic is a bit dated in its noble sentimentality, but it remains a luminous example of Hollywood classicism from the peerless director of mythic Americana, John Ford. Adapted by Nunnally Johnson from John Steinbeck's classic novel, the film tells a simple story about Oklahoma farmers leaving the depression-era dustbowl for the promised land of California, but it's the story's emotional resonance and theme of human perseverance that makes the movie so richly and timelessly rewarding. It's all about the humble Joad family's cross-country trek to escape the economic devastation of their ruined farmland, beginning when Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) returns from a four-year prison term to discover that his family home is empty. He's reunited with his family just as they're setting out for the westbound journey, and thus begins an odyssey of saddening losses and strengthening hopes. As Ma Joad, Oscar-winner Jane Darwell is the embodiment of one of America's greatest social tragedies and the \"Okie\" spirit of pressing forward against all odds (as she says, \"because we're the people\"). A documentary-styled production for which Ford and cinematographer Gregg Toland demanded painstaking authenticity,The Grapes of Wrathis much more than a classy, old-fashioned history lesson. With dialogue and scenes that rank among the most moving and memorable ever filmed, it's a classic among classics--simply put, one of the finest films ever made.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783222955", "6301797957", "6301976983", "6301964268", "6301562178", "6304935811", "1558807780", "6302656125", "6305081832", "0800132009", "6302360978", "6304119038", "6302226899", "0769403468", "6302091632", "0800113055", "6300181111", "6301976398", "6301586026", "6303393985", "6304039522", "630491010X", "6302816416", "6301802012", "6304071876", "6300268799", "0783235593", "6301966465", "630266232X", "B00005NQGQ", "6302503515", "6303364772", "6300182304", "6301798708", "6301734734", "6303560040", "B000003U12", "B0000068EE", "B00004RGUU", "6304028385", "6300181472", "6300267865", "6301973232", "B000BWIZTU", "6300216039", "B00000FZCU", "6301586042", "6302952581", "6302227127", "630248443X", "6300181340", "0783221347", "6300215962", "6302909023", "6302041090", "6302526167", "0792837916", "B00000F3QZ", "6301661850", "6302130379", "0792107128", "6302700949", "B000007PI4", "6302800897", "6303383009", "0792106989", "6300267970", "6300181154", "B00000F14D", "B00004WZR1", "630280096X", "1558035745", "6300215601", "6300215741", "6300215733", "0792107683", "6303696678", "0792108280", "6305718792"], "bought_together": ["0783222955"], "also_viewed": ["0790743531", "1558807780", "6304539258", "0783216084", "6303402070", "6304429274", "6301976983", "6305123616", "0792839846"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 144842}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.36, "brand": "Studio Classic", "asin": "6301797906", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z8A6KK0BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Grapes of Wrath  [VHS]"}

Roy Scheider plays a Manhattan psychologist, Sam Rice, who is dragged into a murder investigation when one of his patients is killed. The prime suspect is played by Meryl Streep, then at the height of her stardom (the film was released within a week of Streep's triumphantSophie's Choicein 1982). Rice understandably lets his basic instincts take over and falls for this brisk, blond mystery woman, though he can't help wondering whether she will kiss him or kill him.

{"description": "The second most-watched miniseries (afterRoots) of all time,The Thorn Birdswas originally broadcast in 1983 and captivated viewers with its story of a lifelong conflict between the spirit and the flesh. Adapted from the bestselling novel by Colleen McCullough, the production stars  Richard Chamberlain as a Catholic priest named Ralph de Bricassart, whose  life in Australia between 1920 and 1962 is one long torment as he pines for his lover, Meggie Carson (Rachel Ward), while seeking advancement in his  clergyman career. The passion and the guilt make for compelling drama, but a stellar cast of supporting players adds muscle to the proceedings: Barbara  Stanwyck (who won an Emmy for her work as Meggie's tough grandmother), Jean Simmons, Richard Kiley, Christopher Plummer, Bryan Brown, and Mare  Winningham. Chamberlain, who was something of the king of the miniseries  form at the time, is very good in the lead, as is the often-underrated Ward. Their affair is indeed irresistible to watch, which proves to be true, too, of the story's thick weave of church politics, forbidden desire, social  change over decades, and family secrets.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005RYA9", "6305123616", "6300218171", "0783215126", "6302571243", "5559477621", "6302571251", "0060087447", "6302320496", "B00004WMLU", "B00E3QJ8DC", "B0007XG2PW", "6304117752", "6301810678", "6304359721", "6300215830", "B004HHX9T6", "0783222955", "B0000A2ZNX", "B000N2BKC2", "B000BITUHU", "B000005PPB", "0792110803", "B00AEBB86A", "6304331908", "0790751089", "1556589433", "6303536859", "6302423651", "6302787513", "0792837649", "B00004TX2C", "6301969316", "6300183912", "630027179X", "6304111398", "6301706587", "1558807780", "630298632X", "6301255011", "6300215644", "B00068S41I", "6301798503", "6301797957", "0800100832", "6301965957", "6300181405", "6300214222", "0792107683", "6302878535", "630279742X", "B0000048ZL", "0790734079", "6301798562", "630248443X"], "bought_together": ["B00005RYA9"], "also_viewed": ["B0056EBH70", "B00E3QJ8DC", "B004EXWGIS", "B002JVWQR8", "B0007XG2PW", "0380018179", "B0000A2ZNX", "B005E1CH8S", "B00BAXTY7G", "B000NJL4QC", "B005DEUER2", "B00BXTDVEO", "B001684L0A"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 184108}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.94, "brand": "", "asin": "6302150620", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519Z58EXCSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Thorn Birds - The Complete Miniseries [VHS]"}

Though the plot remains essentially the same--naive real-estate clerk Thomas (Gustav von Wangenheim) is sent abroad to finalize a sale with the nocturnal Count Orlock (the hideous-looking Max Schreck), who imprisons Thomas and travels to England to claim Thomas's beautiful young wife, Ellen (Greta Schroder), as his own--the visual realization creates a very different story. Schreck plays the vampire as a grotesque demon, with his claw-like hands, bald head and sharp, bat-like ears, and he rises from his coffin with an supernatural stiffness, like a tent pole pulled upright. When the eerily empty ghost ship carrying his coffin arrives in Thomas's home port, a river of rats pours out and spreads through the town like a plague. Perhaps the most noticeable changes from the novel are the absence of Van Helsing and the richer realization of Ellen, the would-be victim, whose innate sensibility and solemn spirituality give her a spooky connection with the vampire. With his stark, symbol-laden visual scheme and sacrificial conclusion, Murnau creates a more mythic tale than any subsequent adaptation of Stoker's novel.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000067JAW", "6300183084", "6303626424", "6300183092"], "also_viewed": ["630526323X", "B00HRUQ8X4"]}, "price": 24.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 311149}, "asin": "6302194296", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VWHHY3ZJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Nosferatu [VHS]"}

{"description": "Thelma & Louiseis a feminist manifesto writ large on the big screen, a smart and funny gender reversal of the standard Hollywood buddy formula, a road movie extraordinaire, with characters who became instant cultural icons. No matter how you define it, Ridley Scott's 1991 box-office hit pinched a nerve and made the cover of national news magazines for tweaking gender politics like no movie before or since. Callie Khouri's screenplay overhauls the buddy formula with its story about two best friends (Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis) who embark on a liberating adventure that turns into an interstate police chase after a traumatic incident makes both women into fugitives; they are en route to a destiny they could never have imagined. The perfect casting of Sarandon and Davis makesThelma & Louisea movie for the ages, and Brad Pitt became an overnight star after his appearance as the con-artist cowboy who gives Davis a memorable (but costly) night in a roadside motel.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301796535", "6304938756", "B0000TANUI", "6300182304", "B000C20VRS", "6302642248", "B004IFIMT4", "6302526574", "6300269728", "0790749246", "6300182533", "B00003OSTO", "0790734060", "6300214044", "6300214222", "0790737566", "B00329TVQA", "B00004RFFA", "1556587864", "6304504012", "6300214753", "6300247236", "6302023742", "B00003CXTF", "6302130379"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 239563}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.96, "brand": "", "asin": "6302250269", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YYTDEG0QL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Thelma &amp; Louise [VHS]"}

{"description": "Director Barry Sonnenfeld (Men in Black) brings his distinctly cartoonish sensibility to this feature film version of the old Charles Addams comic strip. Anjelica Huston was born to play Morticia Addams, matriarch of the ghoulish Addams clan, while the late Raul Julia is a very agreeable, lusty Gomez. But it's Christina Ricci who arguably steals the show as their stone-faced daughter, Wednesday. As is often the problem with adaptations of comics or television shows, somehow an original story has to be implemented that doesn't clutter things up. But clutter is an issue here as the script gets tangled on a lame plot concerning efforts to steal the Addams' house and fortune.

{"description": "Billy Wilder cowrote and directed this brilliant 1957 mystery based on Agatha Christie's celebrated play about an aging London barrister (Charles Laughton) who's preparing to retire when he takes the defense in the most vexing murder case of his distinguished career. In his final completed film (he died of a heart attack less than a year later), Tyrone Power plays the prime suspect in the murder of a wealthy widow, and Marlene Dietrich plays the wife of the accused, whose testimony--and true identity--holds the key to solving the case. A classic of courtroom suspense,Witness for the Prosecutionis one of those movies with enough double-crossing twists to keep the viewer guessing right up to the very end, when yet another surprise is deftly revealed. This being a Billy Wilder film, the dialogue is first-rate and the acting superb, with both Laughton and his offscreen wife Elsa Lanchester (playing the barrister's pesty nurse) winning Academy Awards for their performances. Although later films would concoct even more complicated courtroom scenarios, this remains one of the best films of its kind and a model for all those films that followed its lead.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0782006779", "6301005740", "6304039530", "6300215741", "6302801133", "6302800897", "0800100832", "6300215644", "6301798732", "B000A9QK7I", "630266232X", "630236308X", "6303364772", "B0000068ZQ", "6301797957", "B000006N70", "B000A1KF8Q", "079284517X", "6301670140", "6302909023", "6302360986", "B00AEFYO5I", "6301805615", "0783217390", "6302700949", "6300267865", "B0018PH3L0", "6302375827", "B005LAIGYQ", "B00004TX24", "6303637574", "6300208060", "B0000068EE", "6301973232", "6305012792", "6304291698", "6300183912", "6300216721", "6300215962", "630141277X", "0783235593", "6302226899", "6302360978", "1558808590", "1558807780", "6301959728", "6301976061", "0800104803", "6301976622", "6302682630", "6300246868", "6301586026", "0792837967", "6301969316", "6302415853", "B000AQOER4", "6301964012", "B00000F13T", "6302308577", "6301977815", "0792837096", "6300268594", "630396155X", "0790743213", "6301798503", "6304119097", "6303686745", "6302842263", "0783236352", "6300181472", "6301801946", "6300182479", "6304111363", "6302023742", "B000021Y6K", "6302305942", "6300181421", "B0009FJKC0", "6301578805", "6301798759", "6304056931", "6304508557", "6300269639", "080013222X", "0790743531", "6302715555", "6302952581", "6304152469", "6301978110", "6302413451", "6301965701", "6302962048", "B000003KE0", "6304359705", "B00005Q4GZ", "078200847X", "6300208133", "6300269264", "6302990084", "0792841026"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFYO5I"], "also_viewed": ["0783235593"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 122280}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6302413435", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5141M0KKZTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Witness for the Prosecution [VHS]"}
{"description": "A potboiler featuring a demented caretaker and a seemingly hapless suburban family, this isThe Nannyof the 1990s. However, it is much more predictable than that 1965 Bette Davis psychodrama, and more graphic. It works only because Rebecca De Mornay makes us intensely uncomfortable as the disturbed au pair who wants to take care of much more than her employer's well-being.Annabella Sciorra plays the perfect mother of a flawless family. Her obstetrician, however, is less than wonderful, having enjoyed her examination much more than he should have. When she files sexual harassment charges against the repugnant doctor, he loses face--literally--after shooting himself in the head. Several months later, an ideal nanny shows up at her home. You guessed it--she's the doc's widow.The movie follows a tried and true formula, with the audience in on everything. However, the story does surprise us in intense and intimate ways. The visit to the obstetrician is one of the creepiest moments in the film. You definitely hear the voice of writer Amanda Silver in a plot concerned with the vulnerabilities of a family, a newborn, a marriage.Since we know so much up front, there is an overall lack of inventiveness in the plot machinations. It may not jolt us, but De Mornay does. It's unsettling to watch someone who appears so attractive and who behaves so kindly suddenly reveal hideous psychopathic tendencies. Restraining herself from going over the top, she instead oozes such malevolence you'll want to shudder.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302096227", "6300988767", "6302088607", "6303514723", "6301961366"], "bought_together": ["6302096227"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 180977}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6302450187", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JEJR9N62L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hand That Rocks the Cradle [VHS]"}

{"description": "One of the spookiest ghost stories ever put to film,The Uninvitedis also one of the few classic haunted-house movies to treat the subject with respect and seriousness. Ray Milland and Ruth Hussey play a brother and sister who leave the city to live in a beautiful old house dramatically perched on a cliff overlooking the Cornish coast. As they discover some of the house's peculiarities--the unexplained chill that settles in certain rooms, the aroma of mimosas that wafts through the house, flowers that wilt when brought inside--they are told by local girl Gail Russell that the house is haunted, by the spirit of Russell's mother no less. The rationalist city folk first scoff at the idea but as Milland slowly falls in love with the frightened girl he investigates the legends and discovers some startling hidden truths. Donald Crisp costars as  Russell's humorless, hard-bitten grandfather who forbids her visits to the house. Handsomely shot against the beautiful Cornish countryside, director Lewis Allen wisely suggests more than he shows and the uneasy tone and quietly restrained direction looks forward to such films asThe HauntingandThe Legend of Hell House. Though Allen ultimately reveals a suitably spine-tingling apparition, some of the film's best moments are chilling in their simplicity: nocturnal moans, slamming doors, and the dog's whimpering fear of the upstairs.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005UMF5", "B0045HCJJE", "B0009X75EC", "0783116926", "B000063UR0", "B007XF0W3K", "6301708113", "6303985637", "B00005N5RQ", "B00027JYNK", "B0013D8LAE", "630197350X", "6305416222", "B008BSM1XC", "B000083C6R", "6300183912", "6300208133", "6303333079", "6300154939", "6303011403", "6302878535", "6303364772", "6301661826", "6304308418", "6301415159", "6301670140", "0783236352", "6302308585", "6302374227", "6301640667", "6302424909", "6300183084"], "bought_together": ["B0009X75EC"], "also_viewed": ["B00L3ZB27Q", "6301646088", "B000083C6R", "B0000694WH", "6305106959", "B00JAQJMJ0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 213246}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 30.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6302503493", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51S64WSVPFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Uninvited [VHS]"}

{"description": "John Ford's beautiful, heartfelt drama about a close-knit family of Welsh coal miners is one of the greatest films of Hollywood's golden age--a gentle masterpiece that beatCitizen Kanein the Best Picture race for the 1941 Academy Awards. The picture also won Oscars for Best Director (Ford), Best Supporting Actor (Donald Crisp), Best Art Direction, and Best Cinematography; all of those awards were richly deserved, even if they came at the expense ofKaneand Orson Welles. Based on the novel by Richard Llewellyn, the film focuses its eventful story on 10-year-old Huw (Roddy McDowall), youngest of seven children to Mr. and Mrs. Morgan (Donald Crisp, Sarah Allgood), a hardy couple who've seen the best and worst of times in their South Wales mining town. They're facing one of the worst times as Mr. Morgan refuses to join a miners union whose members have begun a long-term strike. Family tensions grow and Huw must learn many of life's harsher lessons under the tutelage of the local preacher (Walter Pidgeon), who has fallen in love with Huw's sister (Maureen O'Hara). As various crises are confronted and devastating losses endured,How Green Was My Valleyunfolds as a rich, moving portrait of family strength and integrity.

{"description": "EDITOR'S NOTE: According to a Warner Home Video technician involved in  the production ofThe Stanley Kubrick Collection, Kubrick authorized all aspects of theCollection, from the use of Digital Component Video (or \"D-1\") masters originally approved in 1989, to the use of minimalist screen menus, chapter stops, and (in the case of2001: A Space OdysseyandThe Shiningon DVD) supplementary materials. Full-screen presentation ofThe ShiningandFull Metal Jacketwas also approved by Kubrick, who recomposed his original framing,  reportedly believing that those films looked best on video in the full-screen format. (In fact, the original theatrical aspect ratio ofThe Shiningwas 1.66:1, meaning that a relatively small portion of the image is lost.) Kubrick also chose mono over stereo,  believing that inconsistencies in theatrical sound systems resulted in loss of control over theatrical presentation.

Any future attempt to remaster or alter them would  have to be approved by an appointee of the Kubrick estate.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790705141", "0792839846", "6303402070", "0783221347", "0790731975", "0784011923", "6300182916", "6300216047", "0792842464", "6302360978", "6300185281", "6302054982", "6302120101", "B00005ATQA", "6305237115", "0790734079", "B001BZQMFA", "6300184110", "6300183416", "B00000J2L7", "B00000FZCU", "6300216500", "B000AMW2TK", "6301564456", "6300247171", "B00000JGEK", "630442972X", "B00005B238", "0790758474", "0790733927", "6303953425", "0783217528", "0792845684", "B00004W5UA", "0767825411", "6304429274", "6300183092", "6305363668", "0790734877", "B00000JRUB", "0783235607"], "bought_together": ["0790705141"], "also_viewed": ["B001993Y1S", "B008M4MB8K", "B00337QJO8", "B00GGAK0FS", "B00108E1GU", "B006JVPK2M", "6302610702", "B008MILL8C", "6300214826", "B001AQO3QA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 369746}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6302760046", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514N60SRJ4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "2001: A Space Odyssey [VHS]"}

His career is destroyed when his superior and secondary suspect Raymond Horgan (Brian Dennehy) sets him up for the fall. Bonnie Bedelia plays Rusty's wife Barbara, who is not above suspicion herself.

Like most of director Joel Schumacher's films, it's conspicuously designed to push the right marketing and demographic buttons, and granted, there's some pretty cool stuff going on here and there. Take Kiefer Sutherland, for instance. InStand by Mehe played a memorable bully, but here he goes one step further as a memorable bullyvampirewho leads a tribe of teenage vampires on their nocturnal spree of bloodsucking havoc. Jason Patric plays the new guy in town, who quickly attracts a lovely girlfriend (Jami Gertz), only to find that she might be recruiting him into the vampire fold. The movie gets sillier as it goes along, and resorts to a routine action-movie showdown, but it's a visual knockout (featuring great cinematography by Michael Chapman) and boasts a cast that's eminently able (pardon the pun) to sink their teeth into the best parts of an uneven screenplay.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["630018403X", "B00000JPH5", "6300263673", "6300218031", "B00004U8PA", "6300183483", "6301963725", "B00000JGEK", "0784011923", "6300183211", "6300248089", "6302482712", "6300214753", "6304214502", "B000005XXG", "6302256615"], "bought_together": ["630018403X"], "also_viewed": ["6303212379", "0792151712", "6303506291", "6300214710", "B000062XM6", "6301928555"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 209903}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6302814782", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5105MSSAX2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lost Boys [VHS]"}

{"description": "In the mountainous high country above the Australian bush, wild horses  run free: Australians call them wild \"brumbies.\" Author Elyne Mitchell's book,The Silver Brumby, on which this movie is based, is about a magnificent silver stallion, Thowra. The story opens on a dark and stormy night in the high country. Elyne (Caroline Goodall), spins a tale to comfort her daughter, Indi (Ami Daemion). The beautiful mare, Bell-Bell, gives birth to Thowra, an exceptional cream-colored foal, with a mane and tail that gleam silver in the moonlight. We see Thowra grow up through several seasons. Winter has its hardships; the herds of horses find survival difficult in the snow-packed mountains. But summer may be even more dangerous, for that's when men return to the high country to try to catch the brumbies and cruelly break them of their wildness. For one man (called simply \"The Man\" in Elyne's story), capturing Thowra, now king of all the brumbies, becomes an obsession. The Man is played by Russell Crowe, whose usual fine acting is enhanced here by impressive horsemanship. The struggle between Thowra and The Man takes on mythic proportions, building to a haunting climax. Gorgeous footage of wild horses running and rearing in the mountains make this the perfect movie for horse-lovers of all ages. We come to care deeply about the fate of these splendid creatures, whose wisdom and passion are rivaled only by their beauty.--Laura Mirsky", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B000A2WAQU", "B0001BS3FW", "B000U1ZV58", "B00004RFHN", "B004DK5CW4", "B0000AGQ6U", "B008H6GHG0", "B00007GZZV"]}, "price": 49.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 154760}, "asin": "6303102557", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519TTWQSAGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Silver Stallion - King of the Wild Brumbies - (aka &quot;The Silver Brumby&quot;) [VHS]"}

And, in fact, this is the movie that should have made him a star, he's so good in it. Based on the novel by Peter Hedges (who adapted his own book) and directed by Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m (My Life as a Dog), this is the funny, moody tale of a young man named Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp) who lives at home in a small town with his 500-pound Momma (beautifully played by nonpro Darlene Cates), his mentally retarded younger brother Arnie (DiCaprio, utterly convincing), and his sisters. Not a lot happens--Arnie keeps climbing a water tower and getting stuck; Gilbert is involved with a married woman (Mary Steenburgen), then meets a nice new girl in town who's closer to his age (Juliette Lewis). And that's exactly what makes this movie so much more than your run-of-the-mill Hollywood product: it's not about some mechanical, formulaic plot; it's about these characters, and it allows you to spend some time with them and get to know them. Depp may have started out as a TV teen idol on21 Jump Street, but his feature film choices since then--in such wonderfully offbeat and diverse movies asCry-Baby,Edward Scissorhands,Benny & Joon,Donnie Brasco--have made him one of the most interesting, unpredictable, and risk-taking young actors in American movies.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301763041", "630018403X"], "bought_together": ["6301763041"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 216191}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.79, "brand": "", "asin": "6303124798", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51APPGGETRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "What's Eating Gilbert Grape [VHS]"}

While their mother is in the hospital, 10-year-old Satsuki and 4-year-old Mei move into an old-fashioned house in the country with their professor father. At the foot of an enormous camphor tree, Mei discovers the nest of King Totoro, a giant forest spirit who resembles an enormous bunny rabbit. Mei and Satsuki learn that Totoro makes the trees grow, and when he flies over the countryside or roars in his thunderous voice, the winds blow. Totoro becomes the protector of the two sisters, watching over them when they wait for their father, and carrying them over the forests on an enchanted journey. When the children worry about their mother, Totoro sends them to visit her via a Catbus, a magical, multilegged creature with a grin the Cheshire Cat might envy.Unlike many cartoon children, Satsuki and Mei are neither smart-alecky nor cloyingly saccharine. They are credible kids: bright, energetic, silly, helpful, and occasionally impatient. Filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki makes the viewer believe the two sisters love each other in a way no American feature has ever achieved.My Neighbor Totorois enormously popular in Japan, and some of the character merchandise has begun to appear in America.

Director Alfonso Arau (A Walk in the Clouds), adapting a novel by his former wife, Laura Esquivel, tells the story of a young woman (Lumi Cavazos) who learns to suppress her passions under the eye of a stern mother, but channels them into her cooking. The result is a steady stream of cuisine so delicious as to be an almost erotic experience for those lucky enough to have a bite. The film's quotient of magic realism feels a little stock, but the story line is good and Arau's affinity for the sensuality of food (and of nature) is sublime. You might want to rush off to a good Mexican restaurant afterward, but that's a good thing.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"bought_together": ["B004SIP6BI"], "also_viewed": ["038542017X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 406490}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.66, "brand": "", "asin": "6303153305", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71JXR2MXZ0L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Like Water for Chocolate [VHS]"}

{"description": "Britain's Ealing Studios was at the top of its game when this classic comedy was released in 1951--one of the all-time best crime-caper comedies and a quintessential example of the witty and subtly subversive Ealing style. Alec Guinness stars as a mild-mannered transporter of gold bullion who has spent 20 years moving gold bars to banks in an armored truck. Then one day he simply decides to help himself to a million British pounds' worth of the gold, but to pull off the heist he enlists and old friend (Stanley Holloway), who sculpts and manufactures paperweights. Once the gold is hijacked, it's molded into souvenir miniatures of the Eiffel Tower and shipped off to Paris, right under the noses of British customs officials on alert for the missing gold. Panic ensues when six of the gold miniatures are mistakenly sold to a group of English schoolgirls, and just when the amateur thieves think they've finally pulled off their heist without a hitch ... well, let's just say this classic comedy has a few climactic tricks up its sleeve. Guinness is in peak form here, and director Charles Crichton (who scored a late-career hit withA Fish Called Wandaover a quarter-century later) keeps the action moving with impeccable British efficiency. Along withThe LadykillersandThe Man in the White Suit(both starring Guinness),The Lavender Hill Mobrepresents the golden age of British comedy, and it's still delightfully entertaining.--Jeff Shannon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 458595}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.08, "brand": "", "asin": "6303209963", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FB24FPW8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lavender Hill Mob [VHS]"}
{"description": "Woody Allen combined the best parts of his earlier films in creating HANNAH AND HER SISTERS, his 1986 masterwork about the changing relationships among three sisters living in New York City. Hannah (Mia Farrow) has put her acting career aside in order to take care of her family with second husband Elliot (Michael Caine in an Oscar-winning performance). Elliot has fallen in love with Hannah's sister Lee (Barbara Hershey), who herself is feeling suffocated by her cynical, mean-spirited loner of a lover, played with great intensity by Ingmar Bergman regular Max von Sydow. Meanwhile, third sister Holly (Oscar winnner Dianne Wiest) is struggling to find her own voice, working as a caterer while she tries to get her own acting career going. And in the middle of everything is Mickey (Woody Allen at his most neurotic), a television writer who is divorced from Hannah, has dated Holly, and, when he suspects he might have a brain tumor, decides to re-evaluate his life and his faith in God. HANNAH AND HER SISTERS is Allen's most fully realized, optimistic adult comedy. He won a well-deserved Oscar for his marvelous screenplay, filled with his trademark sharp, witty dialogue, his undying passion for New York (its culture, architecture, music, romance), and some of his most well-developed characters. The cast is extraordinary, the music illuminating, the settings magnificent. Taking place over the course of a few Thanksgivings, Allen's insightful, wonderful film is a thoroughly enjoyable mature look at the trials, tribulations, and triumphs of family life.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005AUJL", "6301963911", "6301964365", "6304039166", "630146494X", "6300216365", "6301972147", "6301971922", "630228175X", "6302718910", "0800102371", "6303430546", "6303011411", "B0000068DV", "6302697042", "6300251012"]}, "price": 13.31, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 442883}, "asin": "6303232663", "imUrl": "http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-site/icons/no-img-sm._CB192198896_.gif", "title": "Hannah &amp; Her Sisters [VHS]"}

{"description": "Boaz Yakin's astounding debut feature looks at the violent world of the projects through the eyes of a 12-year-old drug runner. Sean Nelson delivers a quiet but intense performance as Michael--street name Fresh--a cynical but introspective kid grown up fast and hard on the killing streets of the projects. Samuel L. Jackson costars as Fresh's estranged father, a speed chess hustler in the city park whose dispassionate philosophy--the chess board as life--becomes the film's central metaphor, as Fresh plots a brilliant, coldly brutal plan to save himself and his junkie sister from his world of drug dealers and street violence. Yakin's assured direction delivers a vividly realized world in bold, crisp images and an austere but poetic style that captures the dispassionate point of view of a heart-hardened adolescent street survivor. The excellent score by former Police-man  Stewart Copeland, his most haunting sinceRumblefish, mixes smooth symphonic sounds with bluesy guitars and syncopated percussion, giving the soundtrack the same sad intimacy as Yakin's visuals. The world of Fresh is alive with danger that  threatens to extinguish all the wonder and joy of childhood--the film's most devastating moment observes Fresh helplessly trying to stop the bleeding of a schoolmate, a girl he has a crush on, caught by a stray bullet from a senseless playground murder.

{"description": "David Lean focused all his talent as an epic-maker on Boris Pasternak's sweeping novel about a doctor-poet in revolutionary Russia. The results may sometimes veer toward soap opera, especially with the screen frequently filled with adoring close-ups of Omar Sharif and Julie Christie, but Lean's gift for cramming the screen with spectacle is not to be denied. The streets of Moscow, the snowy steppes of Russia, the house in the country taken over by ice; these are re-created with Lean's unerring sense of grandness. The movie is so lush and so long that it becomes an irresistible wallow, even when logic suffers--likeGone with the Windbefore it andTitanicafter. Sharif, who achieved stardom in Lean's previous film,Lawrence of Arabia, mostly looks noble, but the supporting cast is spiky: Rod Steiger as a fat-cat monster, Tom Courtenay as a self-righteous revolutionary, and Klaus Kinski and Alec Guinness in smaller roles.

{"description": "Ever since this convoluted thriller dazzled audiences and critics in 1995 and won an Oscar for Christopher McQuarrie's twisting screenplay,The Usual Suspectshas continued to divide movie lovers into opposite camps. While a lot of people take great pleasure from the movie's now-famous central mystery (namely, \"Who is Keyser S&ouml;ze?\"), others aren't so easily impressed by a movie that's too enamored of its own cleverness to make much sense. After all, what are we to make of a final scene that renders the entire movie obsolete? Half the fun ofThe Usual Suspectsis the debate it provokes and the sheer pleasure of watching its dynamic cast in action, led (or should we say, mislead) by Oscar-winner Kevin Spacey as the club-footed con man who recounts the saga of enigmatic Hungarian mobster Keyser S&ouml;ze. Spacey's in a band of thieves that includes Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Pollak, and Benicio Del Toro, all gathered in a plot to steal a large shipment of cocaine. The story is told in flashback as a twisted plot being described by Spacey's character to an investigating detective (Chazz Palmintieri), andThe Usual Suspectsis enjoyable for the way it keeps the viewer guessing right up to its surprise ending. Whether that ending will enhance or extinguish the pleasure is up to each viewer to decide.

Filmed at the beach on Maui, the sessions Awakening, Centering, Creativity, Reflection, and Surrender offer movements that follow the cycle of the sun through the course of a day. Viewers are encouraged to first try the entire tape several times, and then use the sessions that correspond to their needs at any particular time. For example, if you've just trudged in the door from a hectic day, you may want to use the Reflection session, in which \"a cooling, tranquil series of forward bends and hip openers let all activities of the day seep in like watercolors setting into paper.\" There is almost no narrative accompanying the five practice sessions, and if you are a beginner you may feel lost at first viewing. Have no fear: there is a wonderful appendix of poses at the end of the tape to which you can refer for tips on technique and variations.--Jhana Bach", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302481945", "094567189X", "B00008G76W", "B00006ADH5", "B00005RV8X", "B00000G3GH"], "bought_together": ["6302481945"], "also_viewed": ["B003H8F3A4", "B001F76OKC", "B00008G76W", "B00D2YCLEO", "094567189X", "B0000A2ZQE", "0945671636"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 279395}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 1.86, "brand": "", "asin": "630394177X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21J1T4KV2HL.jpg", "title": "Yoga Practice for Energy [VHS]"}
{"description": "Ingmar Bergman'sScenes from a Marriageopens with a couple--Marianne (Liv Ullmann) and Johan (Erland Josephson)--being interviewed for a magazine. Every moment seems to teeter on the brink of some rupture; just as they start to get comfortable, the interviewer has them freeze for a photograph. After making some bland general statements, they both start admitting intimate details, confessing that they were brought together by mutual misery, then cheerfully claiming that theirs is a model marriage. The entirety ofScenes from a Marriage, which chronicles their emotional relationship even after their divorce and marriages to other people, continues to have these contradictory moments of honesty and self-deception, cruelty and kindness, concern and self-obsession--all laid bare by the skillful actors and the subtle, constantly shifting screenplay. Every scene is a small movie unto itself; in fact,Scenes from a Marriagewas originally a six-episode TV show, which was carefully edited down into a unified film. This  is one of Bergman's most immediate and accessible works, concerned more with the facts of human behavior than symbolism or abstract themes. Bergman understands how to balance what could be horrible pain and despair with the characters' earnest efforts to improve their lives. His imitators reduce everything to sheer suffering and alienation; Bergman sees the best in his characters, even when their actions are terrible. This 1973 film won numerous awards, including several acting honors for Ullmann.--Bret  Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304209584", "6302783348"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 360686}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 28.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6303968635", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VZZ3XCNSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Scenes From a Marriage [VHS]"}

Based on true events, Troisi plays a shy postman who strikes up an unlikely friendship with exiled Chilean poet Pablo Neruda (Philippe Noiret). Through Neruda's example and tutelage, the hero learns to think of his Italian fishing village in lyrical terms, as well as how to talk to women and even find the strength to take his political stands.

{"description": "This superbly acted, mordantly funny romp through 70&nbsp;years or so of Roman history is one of the best-loved miniseries ever made, and deservedly so. Derek Jacobi plays Roman Emperor Claudius, who reflects in old age on his life and his remarkable family, giving us a history lesson that's unlike anything you learned in school.The story begins in 24&nbsp;B.C. during the reign of Augustus Caesar, Rome's  first emperor, and ends in A.D.&nbsp;54 with Nero on the throne. In between,I, Claudiusdetails the scheming, murder, madness, and lust that passed for politics in the early years of the Pax Romana. The biggest worm in the Roman apple is Augustus's wife, Livia (the superb Si&acirc;n Phillips), whose single-minded pursuit of power shapes the destiny of the Empire. With a carefully planted rumor here and a poisoned fig there, she gradually maneuvers her son, Tiberius, toward the throne, creating an atmosphere of suspicion and treachery that starts Rome on its helter-skelter slide into bloody chaos. Phillips somehow makes us understand this extraordinarily wicked woman. As she ages and her carefully wrought webs begin to unravel, it becomes clear that Livia has been as thoroughly poisoned by her own ambition as her victims were by her carefully prepared meals.Further acting honors go to George Baker as Tiberius, who resists but eventually succumbs to the destiny forced upon him by his mother, and to John Hurt as a hilarious and absolutely terrifying Caligula. In one breathtakingly tense scene, the mad Emperor performs a dance in drag, then asks Claudius to critique it, perfectly capturing the horror of a world where one wrong word means death, or worse. Jacobi is the perfect Claudius, hiding his intelligence behind a crippling stammer and shuffling around the edges of events--until he finds himself pulled to the very center. His wry comments give shape to the tangled story of his family and help the audience make sense of a dauntingly complex cast of characters.I, Claudiusmight seem a little studio-bound to viewers brought up on more recent big-budget costume dramas, but the topnotch cast and the incident-filled plot are more than enough to hold the attention through almost 11&nbsp;hours of gripping, deliciously wicked Roman follies. This boxed set also includes a documentary entitled \"The Epic That Never Was,\" about Alexander Korda's failed attempt to filmI, Claudiusin 1937. The film, directed by Josef von Sternberg and starring Charles Laughton as Claudius and Merle Oberon as Messalina, was abandoned unfinished, and it remains one of Hollywood's great lost movies.--Simon Leake", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302676185", "630354231X", "6302075270"], "also_viewed": ["B006JY3OHW", "6302075270"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 306411}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.93, "brand": "", "asin": "6303980813", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AV6N7YYFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "I, Claudius [VHS]"}
{"description": "Julia Ormond faced one of the great challenges of her career when she tried to re-create Audrey Hepburn's title role in the 1995 remake of 1954'sSabrina. Happily, Ormond performed admirably, and while she may not have the same gamine charm of Hepburn, she makes the role her own. In fact, her transformation from mousy girl to sophisticated young woman is actually more dramatic in this updated version. The basic plot is the same--chauffeur's daughter falls in love with the son of the rich household, only to be wooed away by the older brother for business purposes--but it has been entertainingly modernized: The head of the Larrabee household is the strong matriarch (Nancy Marchand); Sabrina goes to Paris to work with a photographer instead of going to cooking school (although that means the wonderful \"new egg\" scene of the original had to be ditched); David's (Greg Kinnear) character has been toned down and made more sympathetic; and Humphrey Bogart's revolutionary plastic has become the flattest TV screen ever made. Lauren Holly does a fine job playing Elizabeth Tyson, David's fianc&eacute;e. If you watch this for its own worth--instead of comparing it to the original--this will prove to be a terrific lighthearted romantic comedy.--Jenny Brown", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767800451", "6304178352"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 353633}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.43, "brand": "", "asin": "6304044836", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71YBX7Z9PGL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Sabrina [VHS]"}

{"description": "Some people may sneer at this 1965 musical, but the truth is the film has earned its status as a perennially watchable romantic-drama, largely on the strength of a fun story and chemistry between stars Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer. Veteran filmmaker Robert Wise (The Day the Earth Stood Still) mostly stays out of the way of the film's appealing elements, which include a based-on-fact tale of Austria's von Trapp family, who fled their Nazi-occupied country in 1938. Andrews is delightful and even fascinating as Maria, who sheds her tomboyish ways as a novice nun to accept the mantle of adulthood, becoming matron of the motherless von Trapp clan. Plummer is matinee-idol handsome and gives a smart performance to boot, and the cast of young people and kids who make up the singing von Trapp children make a strong impression.

{"description": "Veronica Sawyer (Winona Ryder) has sacrificed everything in order to preserve her place in Westerburg High's most impenetrable social clique, the HEATHERS. As the only member of the group not named \"Heather\", Veronica has to work extra hard just to stay afloat. Going against her own morals and intelligence, Veronica succumbs to peer pressure on a daily basis, faking her delight in the humiliation of the school's less popular students. Bored of the frat parties and cow tipping so popular among her friends, Veronica's curiosity is peaked when a mysterious new guy named J.D. comes to town. The dark, brooding J.D. (Christian Slater at his best) observes Veronica among her pack in the lunchroom (where social hierarchy is most clearly displayed), concluding that Veronica is not a Heather at heart. When Veronica confides in J.D. that she hates her friends and wishes Heather #1 was dead, she never expects her words to have such dire consequences. Before she knows what's happening, J.D. is dragging Veronica on a killing spree staged as a teen suicide outbreak. But as Veronica soon learns, even death cannot stop the HEATHERS. As one Heather dies, her red scrunchee (the symbol of all power) gets passed on to the next Heather in line, and the clique that was the HEATHERS starts to feel like an inescapable social disease. How far will this war for popularity go? By far the darkest of teen comedies, HEATHERS invented a vocabulary of teen-speak all its own, asking questions like \"What's your damage?\" and introducing phrases like \"How very\". Director Michael Lehmann successfully blends the horror, comedy, and teen movie genres, creating a truly original film. Full of dark humor and deeply sardonic messages, HEATHERS takes a fresh look at the often-sugarcoated cinematic world of high school. Set in the 1980's, the film feels timeless in its relevance because of the daring nature of its themes.", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300183416", "B00005T33W", "0767819586", "B000065RCD"], "bought_together": ["6300183416"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 590283}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.94, "brand": "", "asin": "6304361009", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BZA4724XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Heathers [VHS]"}

{"description": "Audrey Hepburn's last Oscar nomination was for this adaptation of Frederick Knott's famed stage thriller about a blind woman, a con man (Alan Arkin), and a doll full of heroin. Thanks to Hepburn's husband, a photographer who does a good deal of traveling, she's unknowingly come into possession of said doll, which was given to him on a plane by a comely young drug runner who winds up dead. The murderous Arkin, aided by sympathetic henchman Richard Crenna, will let nothing stand in the way of his obtaining it, even if it comes down to assaying multiple \"personalities\" in order to visit and terrorize Hepburn; Crenna is unwillingly enlisted to help. However, the \"world's champion blind lady\" (as Hepburn sardonically states) is more than up to the task of defending herself in her basement Manhattan apartment in a heart-stopping climax that to this day still defines the way horror movies with jack-in-the-box psychos are made. Despite the obvious staginess of it all (the entire action takes place in Hepburn's apartment), it still works magnificently, thanks to Hepburn's steely will and Arkin's deadly, sadistic madman. A helpful hint: turn out all the lights when you watch it; theaters back in 1967 did so, killing the guiding lights during the film's last 15 minutes.

{"description": "Dashing Errol Flynn is the definitive Robin Hood in the most gloriously swashbuckling version of the legendary story. Warner Brothers reunited Michael Curtiz, their top-action director, with the winning team of Flynn and Olivia de Havilland (Maid Marian) and perennial villain Basil Rathbone as the aristocratic Sir Guy of Gisbourne, and pulled out all stops for the production. It became their costliest film to date, a grandly handsome, glowing Technicolor adventure set to a stirring,Oscar-winning scoreby Erich Wolfgang Korngold. The decadent Prince John (a smoothly conniving Claude Rains) takes advantage of King Richard's absence to tax the country into poverty but meets his match in the medieval guerrilla rebel Robin Hood and his Merry Men of Sherwood Forest, who rise up and, to quote a clich&eacute; coined by the film, \"steal from the rich and give to the poor.\" Stocky Alan Hale Sr. plays Robin's loyal friend Little John (a part he played in Douglas Fairbanks's silent version), Eugene Palette the portly Friar Tuck, and Melville Cooper the bumbling Sheriff of Nottingham. Flynn's confidence and cocky charm makes for a perfect Robin Hood, and his easygoing manner is a marvelous counterpoint to Rathbone's regal bearing and courtly diction. The film climaxes in their rousing battle-to-the-finish sword fight, a magnificently choreographed scene highlighted by Curtiz's inventive use of shadows cast upon the castle walls.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302120527", "6301976932", "6301977181", "6301977149", "6303212263", "6305123616", "B00004RFHL", "6301574117", "0790743159", "6300214060", "B00005A1VH", "6304178352", "0792839846", "630233683X", "6301977173", "6302961688", "630150528X", "6304935811", "B00005RRG6", "B00000JKNP", "6301973305", "6301670140", "1558800034", "0792107683", "B00004RGUU", "0782008348"], "bought_together": ["6301977149"], "also_viewed": ["B00005PJ8I"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 538065}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6304546386", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RMAFMQ02L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Adventures of Robin Hood [VHS]"}

Val Kilmer plays Simon Templar, the mercenary spy, who is hired to steal a fusion formula but falls in love with the scientist (Elisabeth Shue) who cooked it up.

{"description": "Best known for making movies about men and violence, director Walter Hill scored a misfire with this ambitious but ultimately dreary remake of Akira Kurosawa's samurai classicYojimbo. The story's essentially the same but the setting has been switched to a dusty, almost ghostly Texas town in the 1930s, where two rival Chicago gangs are locked in an uneasy truce. Bruce Willis plays the lone drifter who allies himself with both gangs to his own advantage, working both sides against each other according to his own hidden agenda. The violence escalates to a bloody climax, of course, with Christopher Walken, David Patrick Kelly, and Michael Imperioli as trigger-happy lieutenants in a lonely, desolate war. Fans of gangster movies will want to see this, and, if nothing else, Hill has brought his polished style to a vaguely mythic story. It's far from being a classic, however, and although its action is at times masterfully choreographed, the movie's humorless attitude is unexpectedly oppressive.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783226888", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00562I40K", "B002AS466O", "0767807588", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B005R08HJY", "0767821513", "B000FFL2G6", "B00000JDIQ", "0780618548", "B00005JKTP", "B000XT1P4S", "B003Q6D2B4", "B009HIKAN8", "B000RETOH4", "B000QUCRB4", "B00BLF9FOK", "B002AT8K9W", "B0058ZPNBI", "0767817710", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000056PNL", "B000095WW8", "B003AWRMCE", "B000P0J0AG", "B002ZG96ZC", "B000FKO5QK", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B00008RH3L", "B002ZG999U", "B002GHHHP6", "B002VWNICC", "0767802519", "B008E70EES", "B0045HCJG2", "B0000TANUI", "B002QEHPQU", "B00005UQ9T", "B00004Y87N", "B008JFURII", "B000O78KW4", "6305263248", "B0062P3392", "B000E5N6LG", "B0010YVCB6", "B003L20IG0", "6305767866", "B0045HCJ5S", "6304711891", "B0045HCIWW", "B003ASLJIQ", "B005LAIGRS", "6304806434", "B0068MNNS0", "B00011CZRE", "B001LRJH0U", "B000BRP4BM", "B00AEFXVOI", "B000XR9L50", "B003ASLJRC", "B00BUAEYVK", "B003ASLJS6", "B003ASLJOU", "B004ULNJIU", "B00003CY5A", "B00005JLX2", "B00AEFXT1S", "B002AT8KA6", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B002FU8IWU", "B00AEBB86A", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B0007PALZ2", "1558908846", "B001UV4XGA", "B001LMAK88", "B001R3YRG2", "B00AG51V8E", "B001N44BVQ", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B005LAIILM", "B0000DI87S", "B000NOIVT0", "B002DU39GW", "B0043X1FLI", "B004A8ZX28", "B00004STDN", "B003AWRMBA", "B002GHHHME", "B00005V4XW", "B000J4QWMC", "B004EPYZOO", "B00388PK7O", "B005S9ELVC", "B001B3LIOC", "B00AS1Q93S", "B00008K76U", "B00005JLQN", "B009MF5BXK"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFYYWQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003F18008", "B0009ETCUQ", "B002GSXKNS", "B00AEFYYWQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23129}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.52, "brand": "New Line Studios", "asin": "6304698747", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TWD0Y9QDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Last Man Standing"}

{"description": "A little-known comedy gem, this never-more-timely sendup of quiz shows  and media promotions stars a delightfully aloof Ronald Colman as Beauregard Bottomley, the \"last scholar.\" Beauregard, out of work and living with his sister (Barbara Britton), hits on the idea of making a bundle on theMasquerade for Moneyradio show, produced by Milady Soap and hosted by a good-natured dolt (yes, that's Art Linkletter).Initially, Beauregard is in it for the loot, but this soon changes as the show's apoplectic boss, Burnbridge Waters (Vincent Price), mobilizes his staff--and in-house Mata Hari (Celeste Holm)--to finish off the seemingly unflappable contestant. Now front-page news, Beauregard means higher ratings and increased soap sales. Burnbridge realizes he has created a monster.Directed by Richard Whorf from a script by Hans Jacoby and Fred Brady, with music by Dimitri Tiomkin, this sophisticated, rapid-fire lark will remind some of vintage Preston Sturges (Sullivan's Travels). It  benefits immeasurably from the casting of Colman and Price as antagonists. Colman does a shrewd parody of his erudite charmers, and Price proves that he had the makings of a top-flight comedian well before he turned to ham-and-stakes horror. The title refers to Beauregard's alcoholic parrot and its choice of beverage.--Glenn Lovell", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303391915", "6302526094"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 388469}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.44, "brand": "", "asin": "6304681003", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H1PQJFX8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Champagne for Caesar [VHS]"}
{"description": "Halloweenis as pure and undiluted as its title.  In the small town of Haddonfield, Illinois, a teenage baby sitter  tries to survive a Halloween night of relentless terror, during which  a knife-wielding maniac goes after the town's hormonally charged  youths. Director John Carpenter takes this simple situation and  orchestrates a superbly mounted symphony of horrors. It's a movie much scarier for its dark spaces and ominous camera movements  than for its explicit bloodletting (which is actually minimal). Composed  by Carpenter himself, the movie's freaky music sets the tone; and his  script (cowritten with Debra Hill) is laced with references to other  horror pictures, especiallyPsycho. The baby sitter is played  by Jamie Lee Curtis, the real-life daughter ofPsychovictim  Janet Leigh; and the obsessed policeman played by Donald Pleasence  is named Sam Loomis, after John Gavin's character inPsycho.  In the end, though,Halloweenstands on its own as an  uncannily frightening experience--it's one of those movies that had  audiences literally jumping out of their seats and shouting at the  screen. (\"No! Don't drop that knife!\") Produced on a low budget,  the picture turned a monster profit, and spawned many sequels,  none of which approached the 1978 original. Curtis returned for two  more installments: 1981's dismalHalloween II, which picked  up the story the day after the unfortunate events, and 1998's occasionally  grippingHalloween H20, which proved the former baby sitter  was still haunted after 20 years.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005LC4Q", "B000FA57UI", "B000FA57US", "B000Q66Q2O", "B005CFC0N8", "B004P7CNUY", "B0000AOX09", "B004P7CM9Q", "B000VKL6Z2", "B00006LPHA", "B002XD0J80", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B001NPD9LS", "B002YICNE2", "B000GETUDI", "B000FS9FE4", "B001DJLD1W", "B00AEFY2LO", "B00006FI0R", "B00AEFY2WI", "B005CFBYW6", "B00006FDBT", "B00AEFY31S", "B00AEFY37C", "B00005K3NR", "B00004TS0G", "B003UGLCIA", "B0087ZG7UW", "B000I2J68M", "B000V4UFZK", "B0000VCZMK", "B0033B5XCS", "B000AM6OQ2", "B0002JP572", "B002VWNIDG", "B0058S0OMS", "B000099T3M", "B00AEFY1V0", "B002ZG971U", "B00AEFYYH6", "B00003CXCF", "B004LWZW2O", "B001B1UO6W", "B00006FDCD", "B000E1ZBIG", "B004SIP9MY", "B000TSIJWY", "B000WC3864", "B004AC6PMG", "B001DJLD0S", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B004P7CMT6", "B0002CHK1S", "B000FC2GA0", "B008CYDD7I", "B0008191WO", "B0024FADD8", "B0053TWVDC", "B00018D42W", "B00AEFY2AA", "B00DTPRZ24", "B000KJU1KK", "B00AEFY2E6", "B0000CEB6Y", "B0006SGYL0", "B00004Y87O", "B0013D8LAE", "B00005JA8B", "B006ZL1P66", "B000GBEWRU", "B000IMUYJM", "B005J9ZFQG", "B001JFZ1UE", "B007STBUHI", "B000E8M0P6", "6305972001", "B00079Z9WI", "B00005A8XX", "B00009PY4G", "B000FAOC2W", "B000AA4JL6", "B0002C4JJ4", "B0002O7XW2", "B008JFUNYG", "B000HEWEGC", "B002LMSWN2", "B00BM4Q4H6", "B000HCO86I", "B008874968", "0783227434", "B0006SSOHC", "B001JFZ122", "B004LWZW24", "B000Q66Q8I", "B00001QGUM", "B000OYCMLM", "B000PMLJMQ", "B00000ILDD", "B00A1AU72A", "B004SIP9E2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00KDU8HQQ", "B00005LC4Q", "B000VKL6Z2", "B002YICNE2"]}, "price": 19.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 349265}, "asin": "6304697961", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NXT68J3CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Halloween"}
{"description": "Walt Disney studios had previously adapted Sheila Burnford's classic animal-adventure novelThe Incredible Journeyin 1963, and the story proves just as durable in this popular 1993 version, in which the heroic trio of animals are given voices provided by Don Ameche, Michael J. Fox, and Sally Field. They don't actually speak (like the clever critters inBabe), but we hear their &quot;voices&quot; as the lost household pets--Shadow the golden retriever, Chance the bulldog, and Sassy the cat--survive a harrowing series of adventures as they struggle to find their way home.  Perfect entertainment for kids, this frequently clever movie offers an abundance of wildlife and beautiful location scenery, and the vocal performances by Ameche, Fox, and Field are surprisingly effective.

{"description": "Matineeoffers one of the best matches of director and screenplay that you're ever likely to find. Raised on a steady diet of 1950s monster movies, Joe Dante later contributed to the genre with such films asGremlinsandExplorers, but it was Charlie Haas's script forMatineethat gave Dante a perfect platform for comedy, dramatic context, and nostalgic homage. Set in Florida during the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, the movie focuses on a schlock-movie promoter named Woolsey (inspired by real-life producer William Castle and played to perfection by John Goodman) who arrives in Key West with his latest Grade-Z extravaganza,Mant, about the raving half-man/half-ant product of \"science run amuck.\" (This movie-within-a-movie is a perfect tribute by Dante, who cast B-movie stalwarts in the kind of roles they'd built careers on.)Balancing youthful exuberance with the ominous threat of nuclear attack, Dante finds his alter ego in Simon Fenton, who plays a 15-year-old captivated by Woolsey's cheesy showmanship. This affectionate devotion is matched by Dante, who captures the anxiety of the missile crisis even asMatineedelivers an abundance of humor. Director John Sayles and Dante-movie veteran Dick Miller have cameos as Woolsey's show-biz accomplices, and Cathy Moriarty is brilliant as Woolsey's wisecracking mistress and Z-movie queen. All of this makesMatineea polished gem that's sweetly entertaining while staying true to the serious context of its story. It's the movie Joe Dante was born to direct.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000WN0SM", "B00K6D1R0I", "B00KUS5YGC", "B00441GYQ0", "B00E1HIWXU", "B00K6D1S7A", "B00KB614HQ", "B0000648ZQ", "B00000K3U3", "B00FUABK36", "B008LFYXDG", "B00GPPXNLC", "B00IO998U2", "B0000694WH", "B00005K3OV", "B000FWHW8Q", "B00L326LTI", "B00I099JZK", "B00DTECHWS", "B00ISSF7S6", "B00I3C1T1Q", "B000K7VHTQ", "B003THSXKU", "B0045HCJRG", "B00HRJVHKE", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B000FVQLKM", "B00GBT61YS", "1613778457", "B00008973H", "B001B9ZVVC", "B00K6J7FGC", "3901644520", "B00005LC4D", "B00BTYSIWI", "B000FFJZO2", "B00009PY45", "B0045HCJKS", "B000RXVNDI", "B00FUABHVQ", "078321958X", "B00AEFXPG2", "B00000IQC4", "B00I462XNO", "B00K6J7Q6G", "0792846060", "B00FM4S5O2", "B000FVQLKW", "B00CDEJRDC", "B000035Z38", "B0088EDONK", "B00I3C1T6G", "0991127900", "B00D9EJFZA", "B001NKWLBW", "B00BXRVQO8", "B0009X770E", "B001Q8MMCE", "B000CCW2UW", "B005STRKC4", "B00JJOY41E", "B000063UR3", "6305428514", "B002I41KNC", "B004Z1HY36", "B00IELX0C2"], "bought_together": ["B0000WN0SM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AMDA2O4", "B0000WN0SM", "B00009AOAX", "B000067FP8"]}, "price": 37.9, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 347038}, "asin": "6305080453", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61M2PDWCASL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Matinee"}

When Bianca's pining suitor Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) gets wind of this, he hires the mysterious, brooding Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger) to loosen Kat up. Of course, what starts out as a paying gig turns to true love as Patrick discovers that underneath her brittle exterior, Kat is a regular babe. The script, by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith, is sitcom-funny with peppy one-liners and lots of smart teenspeak; however, its cleverness and imagination doesn't really extend beyond its characters' Renaissance names and occasional snippets of real Shakespearean dialogue. What makes the movie energetic and winning is the formula that helped makeShe's All Thatsuch a big hit: two high-wattage stars who look great and can really act. Ledger is a hunk of promise with a quick grin and charming Aussie accent, and Stiles mines Kat's bitterness and anger to depths usually unknown in teen films; her recitation of her English class sonnet (from which the film takes its title) is funny, heartbreaking, and hopelessly romantic. The imperious Allison Janney (Primary Colors) nearly steals the film as a no-nonsense guidance counselor secretly writing a trashy romance novel.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303853102", "6302998611", "6302787068", "6301796535", "B00006RCST", "630018403X", "6300183467", "6302091632", "0800109481", "6300214753", "6302968100", "6300263673", "6304978286"], "also_viewed": ["B005HY1P94"]}, "price": 10.53, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 177740}, "asin": "6305537798", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/712HBPMSPEL._SY300_.gif", "title": "10 Things I Hate About You [VHS]"}
{"description": "Are you wondering just exactly who the Blair Witch was? What the Burkittsville, Maryland, legend was all about? Or what exactly fascinated student filmmaker Heather and what possibly took her, Mike, and Josh from this earth? Get all your background questions answered byCurse of the Blair Witch, a one-stop-shopping \"documentary\" originally produced for the Sci-Fi Channel as a tie-in marketing tool. Entirely fictionalized,Curse of the Blair Witchfocuses both on the past and the present, with copious info on the Blair Witch myth as well as on the disappearance of Heather, Josh, and Mike. As it turns out, the original witch was one Elly Kedward, who was accused in 1785 of taking blood from several children; she was subsequently banished to the harsh winter woods and left for dead. Her grisly and bloody legacy involves missing children, polluted water, disemboweled men, and a serial killer of children who claims to have been haunted by \"an old woman ghost.\" Aside from some ineffective \"newsreel\" footage of the serial killer, all this intriguing information is presented convincingly and chillingly.Cursemay in fact freak you out more than the movie, and it evokes the great, pulpyIn Search Ofseries of the '70s, one of the prime inspirations for filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez. News clips of the search for Heather, Josh, and Mike lend a v&eacute;rit&eacute; atmosphere to the proceedings, but shed little light on their mysterious disappearance or their characters. Basically, it's a tease to go see the movie. Still,The Blair Witch Projectprovided only ever-so-slight information on the legend that haunted the forest, so you'll want this cleverly constructed mock documentary to supplement your knowledge of the film.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["0743411536", "B0002IHP1C"], "also_viewed": ["B000056V6H"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 287495}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 7.87, "brand": "", "asin": "6305568901", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SAG2GJGGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]"}

{"description": "Slumming among the locals of a small New York town, Kelley Morse (Chris Klein), graduating senior at a posh prep school and all-around insufferable rich kid, engages the testosterone of one of the hicks (Josh Hartnett) when he flirts with the guy's girlfriend, Samantha (LeeLee Sobieski). A car chase ensues, resulting in Samantha's family's diner getting blown up, which in turn lands the boys in hot water with the law. The upshot is the snotty rich kid is sentenced to help the locals rebuild the diner. A romance develops between Kelley and Samantha, apparently because they like a particular Robert Frost poem. So now they're deep, see. But then their love is tested when Samantha contracts Ali MacGraw disease. You know, that's the sudden disease Ali McGraw gets inLove Story--really an excuse to emphasize the strength of the characters' love. You don't know what you got till it's gone, right? This film would be pretty bad if the performances weren't so engaging, especially LeeLee Sobieski's, who seems to be channeling Helen Hunt in this movie. Though Chris Klein never makes us believe for an instant that his arrogant character could make the changes he does, or that his and Sobieski's characters could ever really get together. The script is too thin to support any motivations, and the film falls into formula weepy territory to appeal to teen tear ducts. Lovers of weepies might overlook the film's plot weaknesses in favor of the strong performances and the prospect of a good cry.--Jim Gay", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CY5P", "6305907110", "B005Z9MFRC", "B00008G7UM", "B000P0J0DS", "B00AMEZDJW", "B004SIP9X8", "B00447L4KA", "B00003CXGJ", "B004P7CN7W", "B00004XPPD", "B000053VB2", "B004SEUJ9Q", "B000067J1O", "B00003CXTG", "B00005RYKU", "B00006ZXSL", "B00005U8EL", "B003M05KU0", "B00005QW6W", "B00000JGHK", "B0000524E5", "B00005JCCB", "B00067BBMS", "B00066FAZ8", "B00AEBB9UU", "B000A5045Q", "B00DW5IL92", "B0002WT4OE", "B002XUBDRY", "B00005JKJS", "B000053VB5", "B001LXIDWM", "B00006ZXSO", "B00006ZXSQ", "B000NVIGLQ", "B000065V3H", "B00002SSKI", "B00003CXL7", "B003NHRIVQ", "B00013WWT8", "B00AEFY99O", "B000GB775E", "B002GIBVWA", "B00005JKWM", "B00003CXK7", "B00006ZXSK", "B000EQ45CO", "078322933X", "B00HW3EZZE", "6305692572", "B000S0SYIM", "B00008K77D", "B00AEFYQE2", "B00JK31YS0", "B0026MP1CC", "B003L20IHE", "B004SEUIZG", "B00004RD1X", "B000683VI4", "B00006ZXSI", "B000765IJK", "0783235380", "B00DVD5SBE", "B00005YUPC", "B002DU39J4", "B00081U7HC", "B0001AVZ9E", "B00008977A", "B00006HAWN", "B00000F0AD", "B000J3OTSM", "B00005JG6N", "0767821769", "B0000A2ZNN", "B0045HCJJ4", "B005YFGJFG", "B000PMFRYC", "B00H9LHVHI", "B009H3LP82", "B002ZG989G", "B002GHHHKG", "B0000C3I99", "B00007E2F5", "B0000CDRVU", "6305428549", "B00AEBB8JM", "6305531293", "B00009AOBI", "0767824954", "B004SIP8LG", "B0071HPP3M", "B0014DZ2WS", "B00DMDE02Q", "B00B96TGQS", "B00009WVSL", "B00441GYVA", "6305433917", "B000089799", "B0050UEVIM"], "bought_together": ["B000P0J0DS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00447L4KA", "B00003CY5P", "078322933X", "B000P0J0DS"]}, "price": 11.55, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 122300}, "asin": "6305962979", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AFYRBKGPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Here on Earth"}
{"description": "High quality DVD manufactured in Hong Kong. Dialog in original English with optional subtitles in Chinese and English. On screen menus are in English and Chinese and are easy to use. Very clear full screen color image. The following review was written for the VHS version: It's been said that this 1948 classic has been responsible for the ballet lessons of more young girls than any other film. It's not hard to understand why: Michael Powell and Emerich Pressburger's dark fairy tale presents the ballet as an exquisite, magical work of art; but under the theatrics and glory is an all-consuming lifestyle with the power to destroy those who love it perhaps too much. Moira Shearer practically glows as Victoria \"Vicky\" Page, a young woman consumed by a will to dance who is accepted into the highly prestigious ballet company run by perfectionist Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook). Meanwhile, a gifted young composer, Julian Craster (Marius Goring), is brought on board as an orchestra coach, and later conductor and composer of the ballet that will make Vicky's name: The Red Shoes, one of the most beautiful and dramatic dances ever captured on film. Professional and personal jealousies soon pull this creative team apart, however, and Vicky is torn between her love of Julian, her responsibility to Boris, and her need to dance. Powell and Pressburger recast Hans Christian Andersen's sad story as a modern romantic melodrama, highlighted by beautiful dances and shot, not as stage ballets, but rather as expressionist cinematic dramas on impossibly grand sets awash with bold color and beautifully captured in glorious Technicolor by cinematographer Jack Cardiff. It's a brilliant melding of dance and drama as Vicky's real life mirror's the tragic story she danced in the Red Shoes ballet. --Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003ICZW7I", "B00008YOFG", "B00AQ6J64O", "B00004XQMY", "B004M66YUS", "B002TOL4E6", "B001IZNIV4", "B004NWPY3E", "B003N2CVOU", "B00007L4I6", "B00JAGF9Y2", "0780022629", "B000G5SIBM", "B000AQKUH2", "6305820767", "B00CYLZC4M", "B000FILVNM", "B000KRNGN6", "B005HK13S6", "B003ZYU3U0", "B0019X400I", "B001D8W7EU", "B001WLMOL4", "B0006GQMBY", "B00K6D1RO4", "B007N5YJPC", "B000025RE7", "B000BYA4HY", "B00005JLV7", "B00DZP1C9K", "B001LMU19G", "B000305ZYS", "B000AYEI9A", "B000BB1MGO", "B00B2BYY1W", "0780022343", "B001LMU1C8", "B005152C82", "B008CJ0JS4", "B0012Z361M", "B005CM1IOI", "B00EOBB6JA", "B00005NC66", "B005VU9LP4", "B000GDH9JQ", "B00005UQ7T", "B004WJT5G0", "B001M9ELJY", "B002LVF2H2", "B009NUHL8M", "B000NOK0HG", "B000E5LEV0", "B000BC8SWE", "B00AEFXD1O", "B0035ECHIG", "B00JAQJMJ0", "0780021134", "B000G8NXYG", "B000093NR0", "B00A01CQIS", "B00005JNIU", "B00AEBB89C", "B0007989ZC", "B0007PALVQ", "B004NWPY20", "0780021320", "B00005AUKD", "B009NYF2GQ", "B00AATV07S", "B005H8G78O", "B00DHN8FXG", "B00008AOWJ", "B00478ED2C", "B0000YEEHG", "B00005BCK0", "B0087ZG7R0", "B00HCSO9O6", "B003XMKMVE", "B000063N9O", "B00DHN8GGW", "6305416222", "B001D8W7F4", "B00K5EJHGO", "6305257450", "B001D8W7EK", "B0001V6ZJ8", "B005DI9906", "B001BEK8E2", "B00065GX64", "B00K6D1QV8", "B000TXNDV6", "B004NWPY7A", "B000QGE8JC", "B001D261ES", "B00H9HZITU", "B009NUHP24", "B003LMPKSQ", "B0001XAOPM", "B0009S4IJW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003N2CVOU", "B00007L4I6", "B001QOGYBI", "B00005QAPH"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 668756}, "asin": "7883062603", "imUrl": "http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-site/icons/no-img-sm._CB192198896_.gif", "title": "The Red Shoes directed by Michael Powell (Import)"}

{"description": "Pixar genius reigns in this funny romantic comedy, which stars a robot who says absolutely nothing for a full 25 minutes yet somehow completely transfixes and endears himself to the audience within the first few minutes of the film. As the last robot left on earth, Wall-E (voiced by Ben Burtt) is one small robot--with a big, big heart--who holds the future of earth and mankind squarely in the palm of his metal hand. He's outlasted all the \"Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class\" robots that were assigned some 700 years ago to clean up the environmental mess that man made of earth while man vacationed aboard the luxury spaceship Axiom. Wall-E has dutifully gone about his job compacting trash, the extreme solitude broken only by his pet cockroach, but he's developed some oddly human habits and ideas. When the Axiom sends its regularly scheduled robotic EVE probe (Elissa Knight) to earth, Wall-E is instantly smitten and proceeds to try to impress EVE with his collection of human memorabilia. EVE's directive compels her to bring Wall-E's newly collected plant sprout to the captain of the Axiom and Wall-E follows in hot pursuit. Suddenly, the human world is turned upside down and the Captain (Jeff Garlin) joins forces with Wall-E and a cast of other misfit robots to lead the now lethargic people back home to earth. Wall-E is a great family film with the most impressive aspect being the depth of emotion conveyed by a simple robot--a machine typically considered devoid of emotion, but made so absolutely touching by the magic of Pixar animation. Also well-worth admiring are the sweeping views from space, the creative yet disturbing vision of what strange luxuries a future space vacation might offer, and the innovative use of trash in a future cityscape. Underneath the slapstick comedy and touching love story is a poignant message about the folly of human greed and its potential effects on earth and the entire human race.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000VBJEEG", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00007LVCM", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B00AFEX83C", "0736424229", "B00005JN4W", "B00005JNQS", "B0042U94UQ", "B00E9ZATJO", "B001OMU6UM", "B00005JNS0", "B0030IIZ4M", "B0034JKZ86", "B002ZG97YM", "B002WJI2QQ", "B004HO6I4M", "B008YWY0HK", "B0012EM5D8", "B0006UEVT0", "B009SZCC9U", "B004G600A4", "B00AAXFYPI", "B00F522C7C", "B008Z1LBU4", "B00CTNYLQA", "B003H9M1Q2", "B000AAF1TU", "B008JFUQ16", "B000ROAK2W", "B000AY74OG", "B00275EHJG", "B00CWM58WY", "B00009M9BK", "B00EV1YZ96", "B001DPHDCY", "B000MV9026", "B001O5LVPI", "0783231474", "B00CQRN3QI", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00I6JOD2S", "B001HN6922", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B0087F7VSY", "B001U2MQE0", "B0030IIYYS", "B00A83075M", "B00H4Z07Q6", "B005LAIH4A", "B000DWMYQ8", "B00CHVJODE", "B0000AOX0O", "B003UESJF6", "B00JK531ES", "B00HLTD2OE", "B0001I561E", "B00BGYO7HG", "B003ZHVJGO", "B001ILFUD2", "B0002YLCOM", "B0039N74CW", "B00004U9WQ", "B00937R6QC", "B00CUDD0C0", "B004EPZ034", "B00004R99S", "B00003CXB4", "B000065V42", "B00005RDSQ", "B004ZBACOE", "B001GCUO7A", "B00AO686JC", "B000AAF1U4", "B0006JMLRK", "B00005JMQZ", "B0043X1FOK", "B00C7JGDBW", "B001JRB17Y", "B001KVZ6G6", "B00005TN8K", "B00005JMFH", "B00E9ZATKI", "B001ILFUDC", "B000V1Y44G", "B00003CX8Y", "B0011U52E2", "B00EBBGLFC", "B000YERP2S", "B00009YXAW", "B00003CXCQ", "B002NZK5SW", "B000G75AZC", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B0084IHVGG", "B00947N6D8", "B004LWZW7Y"], "bought_together": ["B001KVZ6FW", "B000VBJEEG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004HO6I4M", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00I6JOD2S", "B00005JN4W"]}, "price": 17.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 319062}, "asin": "7883706837", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51u-jDIxUZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)"}

Extrapolated from Bruno Barreto'sDona Flor and Her Two Husbands, the film stars Sally Field as a woman about to embark on her second marriage after her first husband, a charismatic Broadway director and choreographer (James Caan), has died. But as she plans her wedding to the likable but unexciting Jeff Bridges, Caan returns from the dead. Though only she can see him, it's a formula for disaster: She begins to doubt her plans and wonders whether she'd be happier with Caan's ghost than with Bridges's live body. Meanwhile, everyone else begins to doubt her sanity because she's talking to a dead man.

{"description": "Perhaps the definitive episode ofMarried... with Childrenis near the  end of the second season, when Al and Peg Bundy (Ed O'Neill and Katey  Segal), pretending to be their recently married neighbors, go on a game  show that tests how willing each newlywed is to torture their spouse. This  episode has everything: The cascade of blithe insults, the cheerful  shredding of all dignity, the outright celebration of humanity's worst  instincts-- everything that has led self-satisfied arbiters of \"culture\"  to proclaimMarried... with Childrenthe most sordid, distasteful  sitcom in the history of mankind. In short, it's sheer genius.As the petty, miserable, conniving, yet perversely vital Bundy family,  O'Neill, Segal, Christina Applegate, and David Faustino give performances  that walk a fine line between outrageous satire and painful truth. It's  the anti-Cosby; family breeds contempt. Children scoff at their  parents, parents resent their children, husbands and wives eye each other  with suspicion and disdain. Episodes hinge on neutering their oversexed  dog, fighting the phone company, and trying to humiliate a high school  nemesis in a bowling tournament, but it's all an excuse for squalid  delirium. This is not an ironic description of the show;Married... with  Childrenis both ruthless and deeply funny. (Though created by men,Married... with Childrenwas frequently produced, written, and  directed by women, which is unusual in the sitcom world. This doesn't  necessarily have anything to do with its sense of humor, but its eagerness  to skewer and roast sacred cows is shared by such women-driven shows asRoseanneandAbsolutely Fabulous.) The jokes are like blunt  instruments, yet delivered with a unique panache that got honed to razor  sharpness in the second season.

{"description": "Yet another recurring character from Saturday Night Live makes the jump to the big screen in this comedy. Leon Phelps (Tim Meadows) is the host of a radio call-in show in which he dispenses advice on the fine art of seduction, for which he seems to have quite a talent - rather surprising, seeing that he's usually broke, nearly everything he says sounds crass and obvious, and he possesses a fashion sense that would have been gauche in the mid-1970s but seems just plain freakish today. After finally going too far during a broadcast, Leon is fired, but he receives a note from one of his former flames who wants him to come back to her - and is willing to support him in high style. This sounds just fine with Leon, except she hasn't signed her name, and now Leon has to backtrack through his numerous conquests of the past and figure out who wants him to work his love magic. Meanwhile, a group of husbands who've been cuckolded by Leon, led by Barney (Lee Evans) and Lance (Will Ferrell), are hot on his trail, eager to get revenge.

{"description": "Employing shock techniques and sound design in a relentless sensory assault,Requiem for a Dreamis about nothing less than the systematic destruction of hope. Based on the novel by Hubert Selby Jr., and adapted by Selby and director Darren Aronofsky, this is undoubtedly one of the most effective films ever made about the experience of drug addiction (both euphoric and nightmarish), and few would deny that Aronofsky, in following his breakthrough filmPi, has pushed the medium to a disturbing extreme, thrusting conventional narrative into a panic zone of traumatized psyches and bodies pushed to the furthest boundaries of chemical tolerance. It's too easy to call this a cautionary tale; it's a guided tour through hell, with Aronofsky as our bold and ruthless host.The film focuses on a quartet of doomed souls, but it's Ellen Burstyn--in a raw and bravely triumphant performance--who most desperately embodies the downward spiral of drug abuse. As lonely widow Sara Goldfarb, she invests all of her dreams in an absurd self-help TV game show, jolting her bloodstream with diet pills and coffee while her son Harry (Jared Leto) shoots heroin with his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and slumming girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly). They're careening toward madness at varying speeds, and Aronofsky tracks this gloomy process by endlessly repeating the imagery of their deadly routines. Tormented by her dietary regime, Sara even imagines a carnivorous refrigerator in one of the film's most memorable scenes. And yet... does any of this have a point? Is Aronofsky telling us anything that any sane person doesn't already know?Requiem for a Dreamis a noteworthy film, but watching it twice would qualify as masochistic behavior.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JM23", "6305594333", "B0007CEXYK", "B00005YUPD", "078401213X", "1560252480", "B00H3JHGBC", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005JMJG", "B000I0QL7I", "B0009A40ES", "B00049QQHI", "B00005ATQB", "B000LAZDPG", "B00003CXZ4", "0792838068", "B0000AC8LR", "0783229526", "6305692572", "B0041KKYEM", "B000QGEB1M", "B00008977H", "B001AR60GK", "B000MGB6NM", "B0045HCJ08", "6305313687", "B001TOD92C", "B00009Y3QI", "B000NO39FG", "B000JBXXYK", "B00008975Z", "6305162026", "B00004UEDQ", "B000068MC2", "B00606OZUY", "B00003CWQR", "B000ERVK4Y", "B000A7DVR2", "B000A9QK6E", "B00EUENWIY", "B0016MJ6T2", "B00005JPAR", "B00008MTXI", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEFXESQ", "B000JMK6LW", "B00004Y6Q5", "B000FVQLQQ", "B000BYA5G4", "B00005JKJA", "B00005JKM2", "B0029LHW68", "B000BBOUUE", "B004FQX5B6", "B000PAAJZ6", "B000N3SU92", "B003YKYX9M", "B00AEBB8O2", "B00007AJF8", "B00A2H9QN8", "B0009WFEDC", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00013RC2K", "B000A7Q2DM", "B00003CXWV", "0792845803", "B001URA5Y8", "B00195I3O0", "B00006AFUR", "B000063JDE", "B00BMKGZVA", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00112S8RS", "B00177YA6U", "0767837398", "B000O76ZQC", "B0052ADP6Y", "B000J10F8C", "B000E6ESU8", "B00009OOFH", "B00005JLRE", "B0059GVBHG", "0767824954", "B00005JLWN", "B00E8G5GU6", "B000QXDCLA", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00004ZETA", "B00AEBB9CS", "B000021Y77", "B00011CZRE", "B002VECM4A", "B00003CXKS", "B006KH6CF4", "B000K7VHQE", "6305127654", "B00AFEXRME", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00020HB32"], "bought_together": ["B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JM23"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JMJG", "B000MEYKD2", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JPAR"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 222264}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.36, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXP1", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519CB9K0QML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut"}

Ray and his buddies concoct a scheme to rob a bank by digging a tunnel from a defunct pizza place next door; as a cover, Frenchy opens a cookie shop in the storefront while Ray and company dig in the back. Ray's burglary is a failure, but Frenchy's cookies are a rousing success, and within a year the store has spawned a nationwide franchise that makes the Winklers rich. However, while Ray wants to move to Miami and bask in the sun, nouveau riche Frenchy now aspires to join high society, with posh art dealer David (Hugh Grant) as her guide.

{"description": "When 12-year-old Renato, riding through his small Italian town on his new bicycle, sees the voluptuous Mal&egrave;na, little does he know he's launching on an infatuation that will carry him through the tumultuous days of World War II.Mal&egrave;nabegins as an enraptured depiction of Renato's adolescent mind--the way he stares, hypnotized, at Mal&egrave;na's garters pressing through the material of her tight skirt, or his frustrated rebellion against the indignity of wearing short pants--but soon transforms into a portrait of small-town prejudice. Mal&egrave;na's looks spark lust and envy in the townspeople; when her husband dies in combat, the gossip only intensifies, to the point that Mal&egrave;na is dragged into court to defend herself against accusations of adultery. When the women of the town refuse to sell her edible food at the market, Mal&egrave;na has little choice but to become what she's been unjustly accused of being. At the end, a twist of fate turns this tale of longing and jealousy into a heartbreaking love story. Monica Bellucci exudes the can't-help-it eroticism that makes Mal&egrave;na such a lightning rod for everyone's desires; she's like a more zaftig Isabelle Adjani. The movie seems to wander at times, but the ending has a powerful emotional impact.

{"description": "In the first season ofThe X-Files, creator Chris Carter was uncertain of the series' future, so each of the episodes is a self-contained suspense story; they do not delve deep into the ongoing X-Files mythology or turn to self-parody and humor as do episodes in later seasons. Yet, these episodes display the elements for which the show would become famous: the cinematic production values and top-notch special effects, the stark lighting of the Vancouver sets, the atmospheric halo of Mark Snow's score, and the clever plots dealing with subjects ranging from the occult, religion, and monsters to urban legends, conspiracy theories, and science fiction. Most importantly, season&nbsp;1 introduces FBI agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Fox \"Spooky\" Mulder (David Duchovny), two of the most attractive government officials around. Scully is the serious-minded medical scientist assigned to join Mulder on the X-Files, a division of the FBI dealing with the paranormal. Mulder is the intuitive thinker with a dry wit, a passionate believer in the existence of paranormal phenomena and one of the few characters on television smart enough to figure out who the bad guy is before the audience does. Their muddled relationship, a deep friendship laced with sexual tension, provides the human heart in a world where the bizarre and horrible lurk in everyday society.The materials on the bonus disc provide some interesting trivia and background, but it is the 24 episodes themselves that make this seven-disc boxed set a true find. Those unfamiliar withThe X-Filesoften view all the fuss with the same skepticism with which Scully first regards her new partner's ideas. But just as she comes to realize the uncanny accuracy of Mulder's outlandish theories, newcomers toThe X-Fileswho sample a few episodes in this boxed set will likely find themselves riveted to their television late into the night. And undoubtedly, the shadows and creaking noises in the house that evening will seem more menacing than usual.--Eugene Wei", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BOH98G", "B000BOH990", "B000CNE0SS", "B000CNE0T2", "B000CNE0TC", "B000EXDS34", "B000EXDS3E", "B000EXDS3Y", "B0007X7044", "B001G7PSZI", "B001FACH7S", "B0006UEVUE", "B001CY5N00", "B00005JA9M", "B0007ZEO7I", "B000002N3A", "B00CRVL5ZE", "B002GP7ZVY", "B00FXW9664", "B002GP7ZVO", "B000083C6V", "B00003CXIS", "B001G7PSSK", "B003V1IU3O", "B000ATQYWY", "B004X60QE2", "B000244E2O", "B0030E5PYO", "B002GP7ZV4", "B000NDEXK2", "B002ZCY872", "0792839056", "B0012CJQYG", "B0002I848K", "B000EBGFPY", "B000UX6THK", "B001C4CI8U", "B00BTYNXJG", "B00005JNOG", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B006BZ8NSE", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00465I156", "B000R7GKQE", "B0002PYS7Y", "B000F8O2Q0", "B000F8O2PQ", "B00466H3CW", "B0009X76XW", "B001T21R5U", "B00005Y1NF", "B000AQ68Z0", "B001BSBBGC", "B000063V8R", "B000BGR1B4", "B007C8RZQ0", "B002BWP2IK", "B0058JEHTS", "B002GP7ZW8", "B000667HBS", "B00DNUSFZQ", "B00CDAG0WW", "B00AEBB9AK", "B000FOPPBA", "B000056T4I", "B001FB4W0C", "B001KOFH2G", "B002JVWRAO", "B0009NZ2RE", "B004QOB8TS", "B000AJJNI6", "B0002ERWVE", "B00BM2JVAA", "0790742012", "B000VDDDY6", "B000F8O2OW", "B00HR2HTRQ", "B004YM6JI2", "B00005JNEQ", "B00003CXZ4", "B000FJH5M2", "B001MVWRNE", "0783225725", "B000EXDS7K", "B00019074O", "B000JLTRHW", "B003BNO9GO", "B001G0MFIS", "B0032JTV6A", "B000FIMG68", "B004LROMWU", "B00008972G", "B001DMVZJ4", "B0011UF79M", "B005FISBTO", "B001715A92", "B000P6YNSE", "B00009PY45", "B00BYNL8DU", "B008B4KVRE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00CRVL5ZE", "B000BOH990", "B000BOH98G", "B0007X7044"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 170142}, "asin": "B00003RQND", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G8JY0Q71L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The X-Files - The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "When Randy the video geek rattles off the rules of surviving a horror  movie in Wes Craven'sScream, he speaks for a generation of filmgoers  who are all too aware of slasher movie clich&eacute;s. Playfully scripted by  Kevin Williamson with a self-aware wink and more than a few nods to its  grandfathers (fromPsychotoHalloweento theFriday the  13thdynasty),Screamskewers teen horror conventions with loving  reverence while re-creating them in a modern, movie-savvy context. And so  goes the series, which continues the satirical spoofing by tackling (what  else?) sequels while sustaining its own self-contained mythology. Catty  reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) turns grisly murders into lurid  bestsellers, a cult of killer wannabes continues to hunt spunky  psycho-survivor Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell) for their 15 minutes of fame, and a  cheesy movie series (Stab) develops within the movie series.Screamremains the high point of the series--a fresh take on a genre  long since collapsed into routine, butScream&nbsp;2spoofs itself  with witty humor (\"Why would anyone want to do that? Sequels suck!\" opines  college film student Randy), and delights with more elaborate set pieces and  all-new rules for surviving a horror movie sequel. The endangered veterans of  the original film reunite one last time forScream&nbsp;3, which plays  out on the movie set ofStab&nbsp;3. (It's a trilogy within a  trilogy!) With Williamson gone, replacement screenwriter Ehran Kruger tries  to mine the formula one more time. It's a little tired by now, and pale  imitations (Urban Legend,I Know What You Did Last Summer) have  further drained the zeitgeist, but the film bubbles with bright humor, and  director Craven is stylistically at the top of his game. As a trilogy, it  remains both the most consistently entertaining and self-aware horror series  ever made.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004LWZW2O", "B000A5045Q", "B003PIUINS", "B000RIWAVW", "B000FSME9W", "B008MXMFVE", "B004EPZ08O", "B000FA57UI", "B005CFC0N8", "6305300801", "6305017115", "B000FA57US", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B001DJLD1W", "B00005LC4Q", "B000RJUZOA", "B004AC6PMG", "0767824954", "B000Q66Q2O", "B001B1UO6W", "B004LWZW2Y", "B00AEFYYH6", "B004P7CN7W", "B004SIP9E2", "B0033B5XCS", "B002ZG99IG", "B004P7CNUY", "B0009MWEM6", "B000FOQ1KY", "B001NPD9LS", "B000VKL6Z2", "B0002JP572", "B004TI35YC", "B001DJLD0S", "B000V4UFZK", "B004P7CM9Q", "B00DTPRZ24", "B0009X763M", "B002R3G912", "B000FC2HS6", "B00CAATSME", "B00018D42W", "B001JFZ1UE", "B00AEFY37C", "B003Q6D27S", "B002AS45YM", "B0000CEB6Y", "B0000541TL", "B00441GYVK", "B000FWHW86", "B002ZG971U", "B0006SGYL0", "B000GETUDI", "B004LWZW24", "B003UGLCIA", "B003UN0752", "B00005A8XX", "B00275EHFU", "B005GT3X68", "B000EHRVP6", "B001AV3BWM", "B00006FI0R", "B00DTPRZ10", "B0053TWVDC", "B000083C6I", "B00008WFU4", "B00BM4Q4H6", "B00006FDCD", "B002G1WPI6", "B002YICNE2", "B008JFUNYG", "B00009PY4G", "B0000VCZMK", "B004AC6PV2", "B000FS9FE4", "B00004W4UD", "B000GBEWRU", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00003CXUP", "B001GCUO4S", "B005CFBZVG", "B000O77SQS", "B00000F0AD", "B008874968", "B0021L8UPS", "B00008WFU5", "B004SIP92O", "B00000IQC4", "B002VWNIDG", "B00079Z9WI", "B000UJ48P4", "B00L89VL96", "B0020PFYHC", "B0056P6SOG", "B0006SSOHC", "B000MM0LIM", "B001AGXEAG", "B00441GYVA", "B007STBUHI", "B00006FDBT"], "bought_together": ["B004LWZW2O"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00KDU8HQQ", "B004LWZW2O", "B004SIP9MY", "B004H83IM8"]}, "price": 36.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 141897}, "asin": "B00004W20F", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/416FN80BG7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Scream Trilogy - Boxed Set"}

{"description": "Shot in London during the 2000 world tour,Brutally Liveshowcases Alice Cooper doing what he's been doing better than anyone else over  the past 25 years: turning a rock concert into a campy theatrical extravaganza. That he's old enough to be almost anyone in the audience's (grand?)father is quite beside the point. For Alice remains one of the few who knows that rock & roll should be fun, even if that means severed heads, gushing blood, and murdered babies. Even the fabled guillotine, from his heyday a quarter-century ago, makes an appearance. Alice also takes a shot at Marilyn Manson, Ozzy Osbourne, and Kiss by calling them \"my undisciplined children.\"Alice and his band rip through 105 minutes of some of his best-known songs, including \"I'm 18,\" \"No More Mr. Nice Guy,\" \"Only Women Bleed,\" and the immortal anthem \"School's Out,\" along with newer tunes like \"Brutal Planet\" and \"Gimme\" (also seen as a bonus video). The concert will surely satisfy Cooper fans, if not win him new ones; the DVD itself is a winner, with bludgeoning DTS and Dolby 5.0 Surround Sound and the choice of alternate camera angles on six of the 25 songs.--Kevin Filipski", "related": {"also_bought": ["B007JZFX42", "B000BCKXT0", "B0006A9GRM", "B000GCG6AU", "B00JPXAOW2", "B000FG65SA", "B00JPXAO5E", "B000002KEN", "B000002KBB", "B001HADE0U", "B00FKIB3XA", "B00EUEWQ2W", "1566054834", "B0043DMXGO", "1780382324", "B00IQ8TSSS", "B008645YXA", "B000002KDS", "B000006XSE", "B0012GN3AU", "B000I5XDV0", "B0099NA3HY", "B0000C7PQW", "B007EVQAFC", "0307382915", "B000MTOR76", "B001ASVAM8", "B0012GMYTG", "B00IQ8TT82", "B00004TLYI", "B003YJ8FQ0", "B00K6D1FZU", "B002WGQJFA", "B000LW7Z4G", "B0012GMUPO", "B000E0OEVW", "B000006XSB", "B000002Q7R", "B00005NQGU", "B000005S5R", "B005F6NA4W", "B00FKIB808", "B001CBW11W", "B000002PH5", "B0009X75MY", "B00001ODGR", "B0016OMGHY", "B000002SIM", "B000002KI5", "B00000G5VR", "B000006XSF", "0062114042", "B008RA3MH8", "B00J2PQXQY", "B00004TZYJ", "B0016OMGI8", "B0006A9TBK", "B000002B6Z", "B000FGG738", "B00FWSWMKQ", "B00BF2RTO2", "B0085KGGLY", "B008BO61BE", "B005MXQD0G", "B0011U52EW", "B00005QBZD", "B000006XSC", "B00HJ7IO0A", "B0007QJ1ES", "B00E5N8E6K", "B0002ZDWAS", "B00E5N8DX4", "B004QPOVF0", "B0000C23F8", "B008NR92SI", "B00430CQ3M", "B00006L923", "B00023B1A8", "B000093OU7", "B007852UTE", "B002SRQ5HU", "B0000VV472", "B0053TWVFA", "B00GC2KHJ4", "B0018M6J72", "B000EQ47TK", "B001NHZ2KM", "B008N92H2E", "B00001OH7S", "B000F0UTTM", "B00DPH7QFM", "B00000IL67", "0307382656", "B004FRVE18", "B000006XSD", "B0009PW004", "B00AFYZDL2", "B008KRI6KG", "B0082SIPXQ", "B00CG0YLGG"], "bought_together": ["B007JZFX42", "B0006A9GRM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007JZFX42", "B009DT9DIY", "B00JPXAO5E", "B0006A9GRM"]}, "price": 9.99, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Metal"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Vocal Pop"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 55081}, "asin": "B0000524E2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J3AHGV3DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Alice Cooper - Brutally Live - DTS"}

{"description": "It's a good thing Sandra Bullock knows her strengths and weaknesses, because without Bullock as star and producer,Miss Congenialitywould be an insufferable mess as opposed to being a mildly enjoyable trifle that is custom-made for Bullock's established screen persona. Only Bullock's fans could really appreciate this fluff (even then they'll wish its ripe premise had been more intelligently handled), but it's not without some highlights to accompany Bullock's reliable charms. Here she plays clumsy, nerdy FBI agent Gracie Hart, who is given the horrific pseudonym Gracie Lou Freebush (one example of the movie's juvenile tendencies) when assigned to infiltrate a beauty pageant to investigate threats of a terrorist attack.Transforming Bullock from frumpy to stunning is a piece of cake (although she gives pageant coach Michael Caine a run for his money), so the movie's premise is trivial at best. More enjoyable is her character's uncouth disdain for pageant contestants and her mistaken perception that they're all a bunch of bimbos. The movie nicely charts Gracie's realization that her own pageant makeover provides a much-needed ego boost. In addition to Caine's effortless scene-stealing, pageant host William Shatner and organizer Candice Bergen are smart choices for comedic support (Shatner's a perfect Bert Parks wannabe), but the movie desperately needs a credible foundation for its comedy to really pay off. Bullock's bureau boss (Benjamin Bratt) is an unconvincing dimwit, and none of the plotting is as smart as sayBeverly Hills Copin combining procedure with laughs. That leaves Bullock to carry the burden of a comedy that just barely works in her favor.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009KA2OA", "B00005O5CM", "B00005JM55", "6304765266", "B002K0WBXW", "B00081U7HC", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B00003CXSM", "B00006ZXSL", "B00008NRI7", "B002VECM6S", "B00007E2F5", "B0006GANOQ", "B00AEBB8NS", "B00003CXMP", "B0000524E5", "B00AEFY99O", "B00006FMUW", "B000HEWEE4", "B002NZK5V4", "B000YDBPAM", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00AEBB8R4", "B000CEV3M8", "B002O3Z50G", "B004SEUJK0", "B000J4QW7W", "B00E8RKHWW", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B00AEFYM2S", "B000209KMW", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00006ZXSK", "B0045HCJJ4", "B00447L4KA", "B00AMEZDJW", "B00008WJD6", "B0000897EG", "B000QUU4LY", "B000MQC9H4", "B00AEFXYOA", "B0000DIXDR", "B000XT1P3E", "0800177258", "0783225504", "B000NA1WE0", "6305236569", "B000023VTP", "B000FO0A9W", "B002SYAGNC", "B001ECDVK4", "B00003CXFV", "B00AEFYF2K", "B000J103OI", "B00005JG6N", "B0036TGSIK", "B00466HN7M", "B00000G3PA", "B0000AOV4I", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFY5TI", "B0015I2RT8", "B001ECDVJU", "B004SIP8JI", "B00005KAQP", "B000ELJAEM", "B0049TC88U", "B002NZK5UU", "B00006ZXSQ", "B00008G8M4", "B004SIP9RO", "6305212112", "B000A343RI", "B004SIP9X8", "0783225733", "6302077818", "B002GHHHP6", "B002GIBVWA", "B00AEBB9WI", "0800141806", "B000683VI4", "B00795C5X4", "B002NZK5RS", "B00003CXTA", "B000JYW5BE", "B00005JM9Q", "B004EPZ070", "B00AEFXZJE", "B003L20IHE", "B007L6VMDK", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00386EZKE", "B000CCBCAI", "B00007BKVC", "0783235070", "B00AEFXWXI", "B000CEV3KU", "B00005BCKF", "B00AEBB8YW", "B0006N2EZ0"], "bought_together": ["B00005O5CM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000NA1WE0", "B003PIUIJC", "6304765266", "B00005O5CM"]}, "price": 9.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 77252}, "asin": "B00005AAA9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514V9KPFJRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Miss Congeniality"}

{"description": "Antoine Fuqua (THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS, BAIT) turns up the intensity level with TRAINING DAY, a charged drama about police corruption in downtown Los Angeles. Ethan Hawke stars as Jake Hoyt, a well-intentioned young officer who thinks he's found his ticket to becoming a detective in the form of undercover officer Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Harris is a notorious figure in the streets and in the office. He also has the authority to make Jake's professional wishes come true, provided Jake is able to prove his worth on Alonzo's team. At first, Alonzo's blunt, carefree demeanor provides a shock to Jake's optimistic system, but as it becomes clear that Alonzo is dangerously out of control, Jake must decide whether or not to risk his future in the name of the law.\n\nWashington's performance as the evil, pragmatic detective is a sight to behold. He delivers his lines with a devilish ferocity that keeps the film bubbling throughout. Hawke slips into the role of the rookie everyman with ease, providing a good contrast to Washington's fiery presence. Former video director Fuqua completes the picture by casting musicians Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and Macy Gray in supporting roles.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792841778", "630268644X", "6303012140", "6300214826"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 428216}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.0, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005JKEC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/415AYTB1GNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Training Day [VHS]"}

{"description": "The key component of this Vista Series DVD is a six-part documentary about the making of the film from idea to theatrical release. M. Night Shyamalan talks at length about the film and his filmmaking technique in this exclusive one-hour feature. The approach is straightforward but at times is as self-congratulatory as a marketing puff piece. Because Shyamalan works so leanly, the five deleted scenes are excellent, including a chilling scene from the film's final act. Also included are storyboard comparisons and another glimpse of one of Shyamalan's early home movies.Signsis the first of the Vista Series to be a single disc and the extras seem light, but there are only a couple of quibbles: the director again does not provide a commentary track and there is no DTS soundtrack.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004BZIY", "B00064LJVE", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00003CXQA", "B000JLTR8Q", "B004SIP92O", "B00AEFYYH6", "B003102JDC", "B00005JNTI", "B00000G3PA", "B002GHHHKQ", "B003Y5H4SO", "B0002DB54A", "B00008G8M4", "B00AEBBA2W", "B0000648X0", "630471193X", "B002O3Z50G", "B00011CZRE", "B000PHVZNE", "B0087ZG7HK", "B002NZK5SM", "B00004XPPG", "B00005JOC9", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B0021L8UXA", "0783225733", "B0006L0LOS", "B0006SGYL0", "B000NOKFHQ", "B005LAIHXQ", "0800177029", "6305767866", "B00004TS0G", "6304711891", "B00AEFY3MC", "B002GIBVVG", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000U1ZV8K", "B00005JNY3", "B00070FX5U", "B00AEBB8NI", "B0002KVUKM", "B00008G8LY", "B000F6IOAM", "B00005JN0T", "B00AEBBA36", "B002LMV7R0", "B002NZK5UU", "B0013FDM7E", "B002O3Z4WK", "B0068FZ0GK", "B00015YVDG", "B000LC55F2", "B00001ZWUS", "B002GHHHL0", "B000BTJDGC", "B000EHRVOW", "B0087ZG7J8", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00005JN2Z", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEFXSLE", "B00019073K", "B00005LC4D", "B00005JL78", "B00IBKXSKA", "B004EPYZPS", "B00000JDIQ", "B00AEBB9WI", "B000RIWAVW", "0780618548", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00005JN0W", "B00AEFXNLY", "6305428115", "0767811100", "0800141601", "B00AEFXT1S", "0780631536", "B00000IQC4", "B004P7CNUY", "B001GCUO02", "B002AS464Q", "B00003CWS3", "B00006FDCD", "B000FS9FCG", "B00005JKZH", "B000067FP8", "B000K7VHQE", "B00BEIYG98", "B00005JNNT", "B000068NNU", "B000XT1P4S", "B0087ZG7PW", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B002I9Z8BM", "B00AEFXKUI", "B0010X73ZG", "B00003CXIP"], "bought_together": ["B00004BZIY", "B004SIP92O"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004BZIY", "B00386EZUY", "B000QUU4M8", "B0000VCZK2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 11300}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.99, "brand": "Touchstone Video", "asin": "B00005JL3T", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51c02AOAyCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Signs"}

{"description": "Delicate and hypnotic,The Hoursinterweaves three stories with remarkable skill: in the 1920s Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) grapples  with her inner demons and slowly works on her novelMrs. Dalloway;  in 1949 housewife Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) feels her own destructive impulses; and in 1999 book editor Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl  Streep)--much like the title character of Woolf's novel--prepares to throw a party, in honor of her dearest friend, a seriously ill  poet (Ed Harris). Small details reverberate from story to story  as a powerhouse cast (including Allison Janney, Toni Collette, Claire  Danes, Jeff Daniels, John C.

{"description": "Disney changes how they have been delivering their recent theatrical hits and improves the DVD experience. Gone is the creators' commentary track; instead there's a robust 45-minute feature on the making of the film that opens up the audience to older kids interested in the craft. The commentary track is for laughs with the MacKenzie Brothers-influenced moose Rutt & Tuke (SCTValumnus Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas) having a good old time; it's a treat for adults as kids. Also, the traditional still gallery has been replaced by a deft 10-minute display of the various artwork, narrated by the artists. All the deleted scenes are voiced and in various forms of animation; additionally there is a Phil Collins song that was not used in the film. Disney reaches into Pixar's bag of tricks with \"outtakes\" that kids will love, along with the two above-average set-top games.

{"description": "A choppy, unsettling meditation on sexual obsession, Nicholas Roeg'sBad Timingstars Theresa Russell and Art Garfunkel as Milena and Alex, two lovers pursuing a torrid relationship in late-1970s Vienna. The movie opens with Milena being rushed to the hospital for an apparent suicide attempt. Alex, a psychology professor, proceeds to play it cool as he's questioned by Inspector Netusil (Harvey Keitel). As Milena fights for her life on the operating table, the story of how she and Alex came together is revealed in startlingly raw passages of lust and bursts of raw emotion. Roeg throws the narrative out of joint with flashbacks and jarring editing, skillfully turning this story of a love affair into a mystery.  The scene in which Milena aggressively seduces Alex on a stairwell is a bravura, gutsy performance from Russell. What's even more startling is the odd casting of this film. After all, thatisthe bare backside of the guy who most famously provided harmonies on \"Scarborough Fair.\" Roeg, clearly enamored with casting musicians in lead roles (David Bowie inThe Man Who Fell to Earthand Mick Jagger inPerformance) also approaches the editing of the film as though it were music, with abrupt, discordant cuts and strange juxtapositions. The film--of a tradition of sexually frank films like Bertolucci'sLast Tango in Paris--is yet another reminder of how deeply filmmakers of the '70s were willing to mine human emotions, especially unpleasant ones.-- Ryan Boudinot", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000KCI92E", "B00009Y3N8", "B004S8021W", "B000069I0A", "B00L3ZB7PS", "B00L3ZB7JO", "B00JVQ7PWU", "B004S8020S", "B00KE3B6NI", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B006M3M5FM", "B00HRISNPM", "B0064SVNHG", "B00013RC66", "B00HE011DE", "B001PYD0L6", "B001TIQT6G", "B00393SG3S", "B0007GAG42", "B001CW7ZT4", "0780022823", "B000CBG5PG", "B00HVOFP6W", "B004CIIXDC", "B0000VLLHK", "B00K0MM4AM", "B00GPPXOTS", "B00004W3HG", "B0052YDMZE", "B00GPPXP6A", "B0007P0X9G", "B000QXDFRG", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B005152C78", "B00F8PTALC", "B0002KPHZG", "B00IGK6TH4", "B00005UQ7Q", "B00HT2RTU6", "B000002P6S", "B00IY1T8T6", "B00GPPXNIK", "B0007989Y8", "B0009298N4", "B001BSBBJE", "B001LMU19G", "B00005BHW6", "B003VA3JTA", "B00IO9J5XW", "B006OB3K56", "B00J2PQZRQ", "B008CB8CJK", "B000BC8SWO", "B000C8Q8ZQ", "B0009VRHLK", "B00FUABJJQ", "0783230559", "B00012L786", "B00005AUKD", "B00F98FOI6", "B00317LM9W", "B00J4LMHMK", "B00F98FOFY", "6305899681", "B000GRU8TK", "B001GCATWK", "B00H96KG2U", "B008Y5OWSO", "B00009ME9Z", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B000XQ4HQO", "B0048LPRCS", "B0012Z363A", "B003KGBISE", "B000I8OOG0", "B000C8Q900", "B001CW7ZSU", "B00DZP1BUU", "B004WPYO3I", "B004WPYO6U", "B000OPPAEM", "B003UM8T3A", "B00005V6N6", "B00007L4I8", "B000AYELEC", "B00018D40O", "B00EMAGKNU", "B0002V7O10", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B00005QAPJ", "B009RWRIMA", "B001PYD0KM", "B00005LPZW", "B00005JP4N", "B006TTC5MM", "B005ND87L8", "B00J2PQZEY", "B00HT2L7VS"], "bought_together": ["B000KCI92E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000KCI92E", "B00009Y3N8", "B00GPPXNIK", "B0016I0AKU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 60014}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.36, "brand": "Image Entertainment", "asin": "B00005JMVQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5146YWTK1SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bad Timing (The Criterion Collection)"}

{"description": "That adorable Audrey Tautou fromAm&#xE9;lieplays the central role in this deceptive story of a rather unusual romance. It would spoil the film's clever design to reveal what happens halfway throughHe Loves Me, He Loves Me Not, so let's just say that Tautou plays a winsome girl in the sunny town of Bordeaux, whose relationship with a married doctor has more layers than first it seems. Samuel LeBihan, fromBrotherhood of the Wolf, plays the doctor, but it's the casting of cutie-pie Tautou that sets up the movie's gradually sinister undertow. Director Laetitia Colombani's inventive structure plays a satisfyingly tricky game with the audience, and may have some viewers going back to the beginning to make sure they saw what they thought they saw. Just don't go in expectingAm&#xE9;liepart deux, and you should find this an ingenious little number.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001CIOCLC", "B008H1Q3QY", "B004YCKKH8", "B0007Z0NYQ", "B0000C9JFO", "B000063K0U", "B002LE8MGW", "B004SEUIXS", "B005V4X8PO", "B001THZAAI", "B0069UV0AY", "B00421IR5I", "B000UVV26A", "B000SSQ7JC", "B002AG2NTI", "B00EMAGJ68", "B000811672", "B000LW7L2M", "B007I1Q59E", "B0002S64SM", "B000GBEWP2", "B0087IT8FK", "B0001I54QQ", "B00005JPX8", "B002VKB0M4", "B000HIVIQU", "B0009P7EI2", "B001AZJKKK", "B0000A1HQP", "B004ZG5EYC", "B00007J5VT", "B004B3254Q", "B000YPUFBA", "B000B58DHQ", "B0000714E9", "B0045NXMJE", "B00000K3TS", "B009CSVQ8Q", "B000934FC2", "B00005B1WH", "B00A92MEJY", "B000UAE7MM", "B00005OSLQ", "B002YBPR4C", "B000CSUNRU", "B001CITQWC", "B004NWPY3E", "B001JV5BA8", "B000296E7W", "B0084O26SI", "B0080QOL6A", "B0019UGYAU", "B001APM44O", "B00AZNEVNE", "B0007IO6GO", "B009TT0BSE", "B000I6BJ56", "B00005N89H", "B000N3T0DW", "B000083C5F", "B004SIP6BI", "B0007A61K6", "B004ZBFRRG", "B00EV1YZKK", "B000FWHW68", "B00AIBZLHS", "B000069I02", "B00GX7WUD4", "B00003CXLD", "B001M72J68", "B00005JKG1", "B0002V7TI8", "B00008ZZ9E", "B00ATK02FO", "B004UXUUDA", "B00009V2IP", "B00D6I7FLA", "B0009XRZKQ", "B002M2T1V8", "B005E7SEK2", "B003Y7D7BU", "B0030BKNIK", "B000021Y77", "B000GH3CQG", "B003U4H0CE", "B00008976Y", "B002VECLXC", "B000YDMPAQ", "B00005NC66", "B00AZNEVJ8", "B00005JNCZ", "0780021541", "B002Z9HBPQ", "0078607183", "B000EBD9SU", "B005HK13S6", "B00005UQA2", "B0000YEENU", "B008EWNP1M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001CIOCLC", "B002LE8MGW", "B008H1Q3QY", "B004SEUIXS"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 70994}, "asin": "B00005JM48", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51UZ-uQV4fL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not"}
{"description": "Like any DVD blockbuster from producer Jerry Bruckheimer, the extras are plentiful and often a bit too self-congratulatory (worst offender here is the primary commentary track). The slickly (natch) produced making-of documentary goes through the standard routine; however, the less-flashy \"fly on the wall\" bits--just showing what happens on set without comment--is more fun, offering effortless insight on the filmmaking process. The best treasure is a nifty interactive history on pirates with plenty of background material. You can simply play the filmed segments or take a tour around a ship to discover the material (and a few surprises). There's a lot of archival material on the theme-park ride that inspired the film and several odds and ends including an enjoyable chronicle of the vintage ship's voyage from its home harbor to the movie set. The kids should really dig the DVD-ROM \"Moonlight Becomes Ye,\" in which they can turn their own mug into a ghostly pirate. There's also a bounty of extended and deleted scenes (19 in all) and a very funny blooper reel. With both DTS and Dolby 5.1, sound systems will get a workout with the excellent (and loud) sound design.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000I0RQVI", "B000U7WV1Y", "B005COPWZW", "B004A8ZWUQ", "B00005JN5E", "B0013BM63O", "B006VRRGNK", "B00005JKZV", "B00005JPH2", "B0014Z4OMU", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00003CWT6", "B004DTLK80", "B00005JKZY", "B0000A1RJI", "B004M1A21K", "B004DTLK7G", "B00003CXZ1", "B001HN694K", "B001E75QH0", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00005JKCH", "B0087ZG7HK", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B000E6EK2Y", "B000E8M0VA", "B003UYUQZW", "B00AEFYGBA", "B000W746GK", "B00005JMQW", "B0083SBMBM", "B001DHXT20", "B0002234LS", "B000W7F5SS", "B002PMV9FG", "B0002KVUKM", "B004EPYZUS", "B0053FANRC", "B00BEZTMFY", "6304806434", "B000VR0570", "0783231644", "B001OQCV6A", "B000AYELVA", "B008JFUO72", "B005G4TJUC", "B00004R99S", "B00023B1LC", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00003CXI1", "B001HQZJMU", "B00000IRE6", "B0002ZDVEU", "B008QE9XD2", "B00F84H73Q", "B00E5I2MEK", "B003Y5H5EW", "B007K3JFUQ", "B003QO8TOQ", "B000NQRR1Q", "B000YPUF9W", "B001EZE5BU", "B004A8ZWSS", "B0009MDPYM", "B00LG6YEKE", "B002ZG980U", "B002ZG994U", "B000U1ZV8K", "B001DZ8TRW", "B00005JLR2", "B000VWYJ86", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00000JQB5", "B004XKCZAG", "B000W796OM", "B001GCUO0W", "B00AQSN7HE", "B00000ILDH", "B0053FANT0", "B0000VAFO0", "B0002IQMAM", "B000HRMAPE", "B004LWZW7Y", "B008UZA8FY", "B0001HLVS2", "B00007AJGH", "B00005JNJV", "B003YAR97K", "B00CHVJODE", "B000UR9T8C", "B0049IHX2C", "B000G6BLW4", "B00177YA1K", "0783227345", "B0014Z4ON4", "B001TK80C0", "B002O5M4T4", "B00AEBBA72", "B00005JOC9"], "bought_together": ["B000I0RQVI", "B000U7WV1Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005COPWZW", "B000I0RQVI", "B0071JADFU", "B00005JPFX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6260}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.23, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JM5E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51fX40gGdXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}

{"description": "More than a few critics hailedSpider-Man 2as \"the best superhero movie ever,\" and there's no compelling reason to argue--thanks to a bigger budget, better special effects, and a dynamic, character-driven plot, it's a notch aboveSpider-Manin terms of emotional depth and rich comic-book sensibility.Ordinary PeopleOscar-winner Alvin Sargent received screenplay credit, and celebrated author and comic-book expert Michael Chabon worked on the story, but it's director Sam Raimi's affinity for the material that bringsSpidey 2to vivid life. When a fusion experiment goes terribly wrong, a brilliant physicist (Alfred Molina) is turned into Spidey's newest nemesis, the deranged, mechanically tentacled \"Doctor Octopus,\" obsessed with completing his experiment and killing Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) in the process. Even more compelling is Peter Parker's urgent dilemma: continue his burdensome, lonely life of crime-fighting as Spider-Man, or pursue love and happiness with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst)? Molina's outstanding as a tragic villain controlled by his own invention, and the action sequences are nothing less than breathtaking, but the real success ofSpider-Man 2is its sense of priorities. With all of Hollywood's biggest and best toys at his disposal, Raimi and his writers stay true to the Marvel mythology, honoringSpider-Mancreators Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, and setting the bar impressively high for the challenge ofSpider-Man 3.--Jeff ShannonDVD Features:The first commentary track is by director Sam Raimi and a self-deprecating Tobey Maguire speaking in tandem, and producer (and Marvel CEO) Avi Arad and coproducer Grant Curtis speaking in tandem. They discuss a number of topics, including Raimi's memory of his excitement over Richard Donner's Superman and how the character of Black Cat had to be dropped from the film. The second commentary is by six members of the Oscar-nominated effects team, and one of their primary focuses is how Doc Ock's arms were achieved by a combination of puppetry and CGI.The centerpiece of the second disc is a massive two-hour documentary that can be viewed all at once or in 12 separate pieces. It covers the development of the story, the visual effects, costumes, stunts, and sound and music. Three shorter featurettes cover Peter Parker's struggle between his personal and hero lives, Doc Ock, and the women in Spider-Man's life, and what's interesting is how they discuss those topics not just in relation to the movies but to the comic books as well.

{"description": "At its core,Stomp the Yardis a romantic drama disguised as a dance film. Or is it the other way around? DJ (Columbus Short) is a troubled teen from Los Angeles who gets a chance for a better life when he is admitted into Atlanta's privileged Truth University. Just when he thought he had escaped a life of gangs, DJ finds himself in the middle of a \"war\" between two upper-crust fraternities where stepping (a popular dance form) is their weapon of choice. When DJ realizes the coed he falls for is the girlfriend of the school's champion stepper, he joins the rival fraternity to try to show her--and himself--that he's as good as anyone else there.Stomp the Yardis not an original film. Add some drums and you've gotDrumline. Change some of the characters around and you've gotSave the Last Dance. What sets the movie apart is the stepping. The precision involved at this level is impressively complicated and Short--a dancer and choreographer--is beautifully expressive both as an actor and a dancer. Sure the plot is predictable and hokey at times. But Short and Meagan Good (as his crush April) have wonderful chemistry together, and the supporting cast--including Harry J. Lennix as DJ's no-nonsense uncle--are delightful to watch. --Jae-Ha KimStills fromStomp the Yard(click for larger image)BeyondStomp the Yardon Amazon.comStomp the Yardon Blu-rayCD SoundtrackDance DVDs", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003SYQ7FC", "B000XSWVEC", "B0001MMGC2", "B000J3OTSM", "B000FS9ULC", "B000LRZHR8", "B00AMEZDJW", "B0012QCZ54", "B0001CNRS4", "B000YAF4Q6", "B004529NKC", "B009ANP4F4", "B00004Y2R1", "B0001FR3HW", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00AMEZDII", "B001K2LFNI", "B000KHYN9C", "B0068FYZES", "6305505780", "B000FUTVLY", "B000BTITFI", "B000HDZKLO", "B003UEYBPI", "B004ULEF5G", "B003Y5H58S", "B000BITV9W", "B005LAIH86", "B00ANDDBBY", "B001DJLD12", "B00066FAC6", "B00004XPPD", "B00E1HIXA2", "B00AEFYAC0", "B00005JLON", "B00003CY51", "B00066FAQW", "B002DOBGWM", "B000PE0GRI", "B000WC39MM", "B00AEFXOKO", "B00EZ50RU4", "B00177YFYM", "B0034G4P1C", "B002GSXKOM", "B00000JGHV", "B000BOH8X2", "B00066FAVW", "B0014DZ2WS", "B000XT1P20", "B00000JGHO", "B00005JKE4", "0783240201", "B00003W8NT", "B00GOZ2LPM", "B0009X7BFK", "B00AMSM9AO", "B001P3SA94", "B000Q7ZNZ4", "B000LW7REE", "B003L16FCC", "B000FS9MXI", "B001K98MGE", "B00003CXMP", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00BEL4QFO", "B002CA68NO", "B0000YEE6M", "B003Y5H56K", "B00005JLQE", "0767812387", "B00005JD5J", "B00005JM10", "6305428409", "B00AEFY6TW", "B00KPYT9PS", "B00005LB86", "B0041QSZS8", "B0018RNF60", "B003QZSWU6", "B002VWNICM", "B0050OWMKW", "B0000524E5", "B004SIP93S", "B00AEFYE08", "B002E01LL6", "0780631234", "B0002B14UW", "B000NA1W3G", "B00H47IX5G", "B002VKB0LU", "B00465I1CE", "B00005JOZC", "B00005B8UA", "B001132GNY", "B0014QLEI6", "B000K4WPCC", "0783237367", "B005LAIH1S", "B00AEFYHVO"], "bought_together": ["B000J3OTSM", "B00AMEZDJW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HZMZ272", "B000J3OTSM", "B00AMEZDJW", "B000XSWVEC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 21010}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.2, "brand": "Generic", "asin": "B00005JPK8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51gZIdNnZcL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Stomp the Yard (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Nearly 20 years after riding his last Crusade, Harrison Ford makes a welcome return as archaeologist/relic hunter Indiana Jones inIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, an action-packed fourth installment that's, in a nutshell, less memorable than the first three but great nostalgia for fans of the series. Producer George Lucas and screenwriter David Koepp (War of the Worlds) set the film during the cold war, as the Soviets--replacing Nazis as Indy's villains of choice and led by a sword-wielding Cate Blanchett with black bob and sunglasses--are in pursuit of a crystal skull, which has mystical powers related to a city of gold. After escaping from them in a spectacular opening action sequence, Indy is coerced to head to Peru at the behest of a young greaser (Shia LaBeouf) whose friend--and Indy's colleague--Professor Oxley (John Hurt) has been captured for his knowledge of the skull's whereabouts. Whatever secrets the skull holds are tertiary; its reveal is the weakest part of the movie, as the CGI effects that inevitably accompany it feel jarring next to the boulder-rolling world of Indy audiences knew and loved. There's plenty of comedy, delightful stunts--ants play a deadly role here--and the return ofRaiderslove interest Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood, once shrill but now softened, giving her ex-love bemused glances and eye-rolls as he huffs his way to save the day. Which brings us to Ford: bullwhip still in hand, he's a little creakier, a lot grayer, but still twice the action hero of anyone in film today. With all the anticipation and hype leading up to the film's release, perhaps no reunion is sweeter than that of Ford with the role that fits him as snugly as that fedora hat.--Ellen A.

{"description": "\"I bought a car. Turned out to be an alien robot. Who knew?\" deadpans Sam Witwicky, hero and human heart of Michael Bay's rollicking robot-smackdown fest,Transformers. Witwicky (the sweetly nerdy Shia LaBeouf, channeling a young John Cusack) is the perfect counterpoint to the nearly nonstop exhilarating action. The plot is simple: an alien civil war (the Autobots vs. the evil Decepticons) has spilled onto Earth, and young Sam is caught in the fray by his newly purchased souped-up Camaro. Which has a mind--and identity, as a noble-warrior robot named Bumblebee--of its own. The effects, especially the mind-blowing transformations of the robots into their earthly forms and back again, are stellar.Fans of the earlier film and TV series will be thrilled at this cutting-edge incarnation, but this version should please all fans of high-adrenaline action. Director Bay gleefully salts the movie with homages to pop-culture touchstones likeRaiders of the Lost Ark,King Kong, and the early technothrillerWarGames. The actors, though clearly all supporting those kickass robots, are uniformly on-target, including the dashing Josh Duhamel as a U.S. Army sergeant fighting an enemy he never anticipated; Jon Voight, as a tough yet sympathetic Secretary of Defense in over his head; and John Turturro, whose special agent manages to be confidently unctuous, even stripped to his undies. But the film belongs to Bumblebee, Optimus Prime, and the dastardly Megatron--and the wicked stunts they collide in all over the globe. Long live Transformers! --A.T. HurleyOn the DVDThe special edition ofTransformersis packed with extras (and more than a few product placements for Hasbro). The entire second disc is devoted to featurettes on aspects of making the technical tour-de-force--and the land mines involved in tinkering with a beloved '80s franchise. Executive producer Steven Spielberg is very much a part of the proceedings, from his introductory comments (\"I think everybody likes the idea of taking something you're familiar with and turning it into something you're not so familiar with--like an 18-wheeler become Optimus Prime\") to mentions of his films that influenced this one, likeE.T.andClose Encounters of the Third Kind.Director Michael Bay is brash and entertaining as he talks about his initial reluctance to take on the project, his indoctrination at \"Transformers U\" at Hasbro, and his enthusiasm for guerrilla-style action filmmaking. Star Shia LaBoeuf says, \"He is the sickest action director\" out there, and there's plenty of evidence here to support that. Other great highlights include features on how key scenes were shot, including the heart-pounding desert battle and the shootout in the streets of downtown L.A.--adrenaline-pumping stuff, even without the Transformers CGI'd in. --A.T.

{"description": "There are loads of extras onThe Spiderwick Chronicles (Two-Disc Field Guide Edition), beginning with a charming overview of the film's supernatural species conducted by director Mark Waters. Waters leads viewers through a primer describing such magical creatures as brownies, ogres, and fairies, taking the whole matter very seriously in the event anyone watching should ever encounter their like. \"It's a Spiderwick World!\" introduces Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black, creators of theThe Spiderwick Chroniclesbook series. The authors discuss the strange inspiration for the story: a letter they received from three siblings who claimed to have gone through exactly what the characters inSpiderwickendure. \"Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide\" is a text- and illustration-based list of creatures in the film, with lots of fascinating factoids. \"Field Guild In-Movie Mode\" allows a viewer to enjoy the benefit of a pop-up guide that appears at times  during the film and lets a viewer click onto helpful information.\"Spiderwick: Meet the Clan!\" is an introduction to the film's cast, with a special emphasis on young star Freddie Highmore's precocious talent, a British child playing twin American brothers with unique speech patterns. \"Making Spiderwick!\" is a behind-the-scenes documentary on production of the film, focusing on production design, location, cinematography, and so on. Among the revelations is that everyone involved was looking for a place to film that could evoke a horror movie yet not be so scary as to turn off youngsters. \"The Magic of Spiderwick\" is a remarkable tour of the special-effects process that made this film work so well. Waters says his directing chores continued all the way through post-production, when he had to switch from directing actors to directing animators, often acting out the defining behaviors of the various mythic characters. \"A Final Word of Advice!\" brings Waters back in front of the camera, reminding us all how to deal with  hobgoblins and other spooks (keep a lot of honey, crackers and red tomato sauce around). Finally, \"Deleted Scenes\" includes some material that didn't make the feature's final cut, but which is shown in context with scenes that were on screen. The result is a more satisfying and enriching experience of deleted scenes than is usually found on DVD special features.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000OYCM5I", "B001NPD9JA", "1442487984", "B00AEFYIQ8", "B000Q66FB6", "1416986855", "B00139W3NE", "B0012IWO0I", "1416990119", "B001APZMJS", "0689859414", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B0016Q2D5M", "B00005JPH2", "B001LPWGBO", "B007R6DJP8", "B000DBHX4M", "B00443FMZM", "B000E8M0VA", "B000XUUQRE", "B004AKCME8", "B00009XUM5", "B002ZG99KO", "B002935GMS", "B004M1A21K", "1416903453", "B003RHZ6IE", "1416927573", "B00CWM58WY", "B000031EGV", "B004VMWTIO", "B003HARV3Y", "1442486929", "B0009NZ2KG", "B002OMIKHC", "0689859376", "B0012EM5D8", "B000P0J09W", "B00437IEI6", "B000YGGNMO", "0689859406", "0689859368", "B00LG6YEKE", "B008JFUNTG", "B00005JNQS", "B00128VA76", "B000065V42", "B001U3D88M", "B000M343BC", "B001LPWGFA", "0689859384", "B000V6I7M6", "0689859392", "B004SIPAFK", "B000NA28I4", "B001GCUO7A", "B00979KQFO", "B002GJTYIW", "B00AEFY9RG", "B004P7CNXQ", "B000BPL2GK", "B00G5G7EXY", "0689871333", "B004SIP75S", "B000J10FLY", "1442486945", "B0006JMLRK", "B00005JMCW", "B000C3L27U", "B003L20IJM", "B000NOKJC2", "B0000AK7AA", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B002WJI2QQ", "B0001HAISG", "0739356151", "B002ZG97YM", "B000P0J0A6", "B0018ATR2S", "B00005JLOT", "B000BITUVG", "B00003CXC3", "B00005JN5E", "B0000VCZKW", "6305123454", "B002NZK5SW", "B002UOMH00", "B00H5RYIBI", "B00AKGG5PS", "B00I6JOD2S", "B00BTYSIWI", "B005FLSZQU", "0689871325", "B00CHVJODE", "B00B04NIZO", "B00000K3D4", "B00009M9BK", "0689871317", "B0000640SC", "B003UYUQZW"], "bought_together": ["B000OYCM5I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000OYCM5I", "B00AEFYIQ8", "B00HR34TBE", "B00HR2WIRC"]}, "price": 35.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 215455}, "asin": "B00005JPXS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YZb2i09tL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Spiderwick Chronicles (2-Disc Field Guide Edition)"}
{"description": "The Dark Knightarrives with tremendous hype (best superhero movie ever? posthumous Oscar for Heath Ledger?), and incredibly, it lives up to all of it.  But calling it the best superhero movie ever seems like faint praise, since part of what makes the movie great--in addition to pitch-perfect casting, outstanding writing, and a compelling vision--is that it bypasses the normal fantasy element of the superhero genre and makes it all terrifyingly real.  Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is Gotham City's new district attorney, charged with cleaning up the crime rings that have paralyzed the city. He enters an uneasy alliance with the young police lieutenant, Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), and Batman (Christian Bale), the caped vigilante who seems to trust only Gordon--and whom only Gordon seems to trust. They make progress until a psychotic and deadly new player enters the game: the Joker (Heath Ledger), who offers the crime bosses a solution--kill the Batman. Further complicating matters is that Dent is now dating Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, after Katie Holmes turned down the chance to reprise her role), the longtime love of Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne.In his last completed role before his tragic death, Ledger is fantastic as the Joker, a volcanic, truly frightening force of evil. And he sets the tone of the movie: the world is a dark, dangerous place where there are no easy choices.  Eckhart and Oldman also shine, but as good as Bale is, his character turns out rather bland in comparison (not uncommon for heroes facing more colorful villains). Director-cowriter Christopher Nolan (Memento) follows his critically acclaimedBatman Beginswith an even better sequel that sets itself apart from notable superhero movies likeSpider-Man 2andIron Manbecause of its sheer emotional impact and striking sense of realism--there are no suspension-of-disbelief superpowers here. At 152 minutes, it's a shade too long, and it's much too intense for kids. But for most movie fans--and not just superhero fans--The Dark Knightis a film for the ages.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B000PC6A3E", "B002ZG981E", "B00G4RD4PQ", "B0039208QM", "B001GMALGY", "B00E2Y0YBK", "B00C2IGQBA", "B0039208JE", "B00H14WTLQ", "B0039208CG", "B0085D3I3K", "B0039208C6", "B000M5AJQI", "B00319ECGK", "B001FB55H6", "B00EIG5M5A", "7020070078", "B00E2Y6AUY", "B00D5FMGGS", "B001OQCV6K", "B0013FBS20", "B000Q6GX5Y", "B001GKJ2FC", "B00FPS79F6", "B001992NUQ", "B004JMSIRC", "B001RIY4WE", "B00DYEN6XC", "B008QZ5PY2", "B001F7MSG6", "B00FAHYNWE", "B00J7PRJXU", "B001AQT0Z4", "B001UV4XEW", "B0083SBJXS", "B00AEFY552", "B00C8RD79O", "B007KAJG3K", "B007L4HET8", "B004EPZ07U", "B007L4HFDI", "B00AEFXKOO", "B000PC0U1W", "B00C6B8TB8", "B00HINFI4K", "B003TT2X6I", "B001KZIRM2", "B002ZG99NG", "B00EZ4M68G", "B004SIP90G", "B003ZHR6RK", "B001GCUO16", "B003TT2X6S", "B00JNEWSLS", "B001F3FUK6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B002ZG981E", "B000PC6A3E"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPY0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pGxSkkz4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Dark Knight [Theatrical Release]"}

{"description": "Americans have never seen a TV sleuth like Brother Cadfael, the medieval  mystery-solving monk indelibly portrayed by Derek Jacobi (I, Claudius,Gladiator) in the wildly popular series of British films based on the  books by Ellis Peters. This self-containedCadfaelmystery may be a bit  of a muddle to novices not familiar with 12th-century English history, but  mystery buffs will enjoy watching Cadfael in action. The former Crusader is,  as one character describes, \"an odd kind of monk.\" St. Peter's Fair promises a  respite from the ongoing civil war between forces loyal to King Stephen and  those to Empress Maud. But the festivities are quickly marred by the murder of  a visiting merchant. When it is suggested the victim \"must\" have been murdered  by a common thief, Cadfael replies, \"We must always be wary of 'must.' Nothing  is certain.\" Indeed, why would a common thief ransack the victim's cart and wares  and leave all valuables behind? With one hot-headed villager falsely arrested, the  answer may lie with the merchant's beautiful and feisty niece Emma, whom Cadfael  takes under his wing.

{"description": "Deservedly hailed as one of the best films of 2001,Witmakes it clear why top-ranking talents seek refuge in the quality programming of HBO. Unhindered by box-office pressures, director Mike Nichols and Emma Thompson turn the most unglamorous topic--the physical and psychological ravages of cancer--into an exquisite contemplation of life, learning, and tenacious, richly expressed humanity. In adapting Margaret Edson's compassionate, Pulitzer Prize-winning play, Nichols and Thompson open up the one-room setting with a superb supporting cast. But their focus remains on the hospital experience of Vivian (Thompson), a fiercely demanding professor of English literature whose academic specialty--the metaphysical poetry of John Donne--is the armor she wears against the cruel indignities of her cancer treatment. While losing all that she held dear, she reassesses her life as an aloof intellectual, andWitilluminates her bracingly eloquent and deeply moving struggle for dignity, meaning, and peace at life's ultimate crossroads.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0571198775", "B00008L3U4", "B00664AM02", "B00067BCBI", "B00000F5MN", "B00BTYJYP8", "0061137596", "B000068MBW", "B00005RDAN", "082633038X", "B005TZFZBU", "B0001CNRAM", "0061230979", "B0007WFUGK", "1573226572", "B00005AQMJ", "B00003CXC9", "0826330371", "B0007LFPJ8", "082221704X", "032308334X", "B00000IQV7", "B00B8X4WBG", "B004YCKKIM", "0553210351", "0971907498", "B00AEBB9FA", "B000TV1ST2", "B00KMULA9I", "1468014315", "B004QL7KKC", "B0001I2BUI", "B004AE3QYE", "B0043X1FL8", "0965464911", "B004OE9P2C", "B001OQCV1K", "0679742441", "B002D755AI", "0345425979", "B00008L3SE", "B00J5LXQKQ", "B000R7HY00", "B00BTYHBX0", "B0073U2EWM", "1451624123", "B0063HO5C8", "0803617844", "B005DXCOY4", "B00K6D1SAC", "B0007QJ1W0", "B000063ING", "B0002J4X20", "B00AEBB8YM", "1605477303", "0135080908", "1451667256", "0767821432", "0763765422", "1449649009", "B001TKNWUU", "B001GF8WPI", "0132706687", "B00GPWEPZ8", "B00006L92W", "B007CK3NYG", "B0006IIPM6", "B00005JKWX", "0375757759", "B0015OKWKI", "B0000714BZ", "B000K7VHQE", "0787976385", "B0011V7PSC", "0763773840", "B00004TJKK", "B0015OKWKS", "B000F1IQNM", "B0013K2ZGI", "0095234772", "B0007P0YKY", "B0000CE684", "0470959584", "B00005YUO1", "0140422099", "B00GUO2SKA", "0801478731", "0767805712", "B000H0MKOC", "B0018YCF50", "0783227906", "0826157912", "0064430189", "B00AEFYSWM", "1594733120", "B00000JMOF", "0060775823", "1558101764", "B00003CX8U", "B00005BCK9"], "bought_together": ["0571198775"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BTYJYP8", "0571198775", "B00008L3U4", "0826330371"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12441}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005MKKV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41MQWHl-FRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wit"}

Fans accustomed to the slick appearance of the later episodes will be delighted by the rougher nature of these earlier episodes, when the characters weren't as well defined (Homer isn't quite as dumb as he is in later seasons) and the animation was still evolving. This only adds to the charm of these 13 episodes, which begin with \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire,\" the December 1989 Christmas special in which a down-and-out Simpson family adopt Santa's Little Helper. Throughout the season, familiar faces are introduced, as we catch first glimpses of Smithers, Mr. Burns, the Flanderses, and Patty and Selma. Highlights of the season include \"The Crepes of Wrath,\" in which Bart is sent to France as an exchange student (\"Don't mess up France the way you messed up your room\"); \"Bart the Genius,\" in which Bart ends up in a school for the gifted; and \"Krusty Gets Busted,\" in which Bart's lifelong animosity with Sideshow Bob begins.--Jenny Brown", "related": {"also_bought": ["B007KFZ7UQ", "B007KFZ8AK", "B007KFZ8B4", "B007KFZ8AA", "B000067DNE", "B007KFZ7YM", "B007KFZ7Q0", "B007KFZ7PG", "B007KFZ87S", "B007KFZ88M", "B001GQ3GHG", "B0024FAR52", "B001L1S1PI", "B003KZ27N0", "B005QIOJ3A", "B000WGYMD8", "B000WGYMGK", "B000BQPC42", "B009DW5YJI", "B00F4NPBI4", "B00023P49C", "B0012KSUTA", "B00009N80Z", "B000E6ES9O", "B002R8JE7S", "B000083C6V", "B009DW5X0I", "B008412UKA", "B003KZ27NA", "B005QIOJ6M", "B00L89VL96", "B000NNK4DM", "B00F4NPBAC", "B00008YGRV", "B00005JM3G", "B000B5XOWU", "B00008YGRS", "B00JDFTN60", "B0006Z2L2Y", "B0002PYS60", "B0000CABL2", "0062267752", "B007ZFR67I", "B00023P49M", "B002DKGWSE", "B000HT3P6U", "B0072BNKHA", "B0077ATSSQ", "B001E6HUXO", "B00AIANIPQ", "B001MVWRNE", "B001VFM0ZG", "B00JNB80YU", "B00HX14C7Q", "B000ADWCYY", "B0006Q93CO", "B00008EY6Q", "B008JFUO0Y", "1612185916", "B0000C2IQB", "B006W93ELK", "B005LAIHY0", "B00HN9D22Y", "B00JO5LJG6", "B001FB55HQ", "B001VLBDD0", "B009SQ9Q5M", "B00C7E3E7S", "B001AQO3QA", "B0024FAD9W", "B002N5N5SO", "B000EQHXOG", "B009LDD40U", "B001CK1D44", "B003Y5H5EW", "B0014Z4OMU", "B00I099K4U", "B003L77GDS", "B00JHH1VUU", "0785154620", "B00BUWD7Y8", "B000ELJAEM", "B005LAIIMG", "B002FOQXTQ", "B008MCKL5W", "B00IMIGWD6", "B00DQC2FPM", "B0087ZG7HK", "B00GZ0ML4C", "B00AO686MY", "B001QIVEVE", "B00005JG6M", "B0001I561E", "0385352107", "B00I0VTPWA"], "bought_together": ["B007KFZ7UQ", "B007KFZ8AK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007KFZ7UQ", "B007KFZ8AA", "B007KFZ7YM", "B00F4NPBI4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 70952}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 23.24, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B00005ML6Y", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P2P9TQYCL._SX300_.jpg", "title": "The Simpsons: The Complete First Season"}

When beautiful but reclusive goth teenager Ginger (Katharine Isabelle) is attacked by a monstrous wolf on the eve of her first period, her body starts changing in a big way, as do her suddenly lusty, feral appetites. Director John Fawcett masterfully balances the expectations of teen horror exploitation (blood, bodies, sex, smart dialogue, and good old-fashioned monster-movie scares) with clever black humor and tender sisterly solidarity. Only devoted sister Brigitte (gloomy Emily Perkins) knows the truth, and even as Ginger's abrupt transformation threatens their once unbreakable friendship, bonds of blood and love keep them together: Brigitte disposes of Ginger's victims while searching for a cure. Mimi Rogers costars as their dotty but unexpectedly sensitive mom, ready to sacrifice all to protect her daughter.

{"description": "Suffering from a bad case of writer's block, author Jack Manfred (Clive Owen) sits in his London flat, staring at an empty computer screen and trying to find the words to narrate his meandering life. Reluctantly Jack accepts a job from his absentee father (Nicholas Ball) at a second-rate casino as a dealer, or croupier, a job he once held in South Africa. His immersion back into this world is intoxicating, thanks primarily to the power he holds over his nightly clientele. Jack is a straight arrow on the floor (unlike his coworkers) but the whisper of an inside-job robbery makes his life suddenly more intriguing, as do the women who begin to drift into his life: a fellow croupier (Kate Hardie) and an alluring gambler (Alex Kingston). Suddenly, Jack finds his own life is his best book material. There's something visceral about watching the world of gambling, and director Mike Hodges (who directed the originalGet Carter) taps into this allure; Jack's simple croupier tryout--handling cards and chips with skill and grace--is as captivating as most action scenes in big popcorn films. In the end, this little film, which went on to become an art-house hit, is as unpredictable as a roll of the dice.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00BTYXNPK", "B004SEUIU6", "B0001EFV7C", "B00005B20H", "B004499LX0", "B00003CWSX", "B004O8OLO0", "B0030Y11T2", "B00IKM5OCO", "B000E5KURY", "B0008ENHTO", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B0029RVZGU", "B006MQ0ERK", "B000XUF6B0", "B0000BXMZ8", "B00IKM5NJS", "B004VK742M", "B00562D3Y2", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00CX7OWWA", "B0013D8LC2", "B00005RYKX", "B000P2A2WY", "B0009GX1CE", "B00HGBAG5K", "B005SYZZ7Q", "B00006CXGZ", "B001CC7PLM", "B00GWXI28Q", "B00005JKNF", "B00004W229", "B007UW9W5U", "B00HRJVHOU", "B00009QGA7", "B00GRZPRB4", "B00121QGPY", "B00GJNQ4B6", "B000E33W0I", "B000QXDFRG", "B00BJB2GZG", "B0043X1FNQ", "B000N6TX1I", "6305594333", "B003A6C6WG", "B000QQFKYE", "B00002E20R", "B00005K3NV", "B0057FGD0E", "B001FB5634", "B000VNMMPM", "B003ODIV10", "B00012QLB4", "B000EQ5UIC", "B00AEFY3TA", "B00BNWWVFG", "B004ALIG1U", "B004C45AZU", "B00JAQJNN0", "B00AEBB9N2", "B0011VJRVU", "0792838068", "B0024FAG6W", "B00003CWQ0", "0792839056", "B00023P4QK", "B0009298N4", "B0041KKZIM", "B000286RNE", "B00005M2CO", "B000KJTGFG", "B00366F2NU", "B00EMAGKNU", "B00008K7AO", "B00006FD9P", "B004YCKKH8", "B000XA5K4I", "B001662FIW", "B00070Q7VE", "B00005R87B", "B005NKIPUY", "B009X919UE", "0783227329", "B00009OOFG", "B003M987QK", "B004EC5ITI", "B00005LZOD", "B000XA5K48", "B0009X7BDC", "B000GFLKF8", "B00000G02H", "B00008V6Y1", "B00008R9KI", "B000WMA6R8", "B000F7CECK", "B00006IUJP", "B004U7MR1Y", "B000TGJ81M", "B00K6D1QV8", "B00BQXTCVS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000N6TX1I", "B000GFLKF8", "B0001EFV7C", "B00BTYXNPK"]}, "price": 7.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 745355}, "asin": "B00005NYFS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VHLLarzzL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Croupier [IMPORT]"}

{"description": "John Frankenheimer updates the mutant-monster films of the 1950s with a modern environmental twist in this well-meaning but clich&eacute;-ridden late-'70s horror film. Robert Foxworth is so earnest it hurts as a rabble-rousing ghetto doctor who packs up his pregnant wife (Talia Shire) and heads out to the Maine woods to investigate claims of environmental pollution. That's the least of his concerns when a gooey mutant grizzly goes on the rampage and he joins forces with Native American activist Armand Assante (wearing his humorless resolve like war paint) to get out of the woods. Frankenheimer is a good director saddled with a bad, blunt script, and like a pro he delivers the requisite gore and even racks up the tension in a terrific opening chase. But even he can't overcome the clumsiest collection of deformed woodland creatures to claw their way through a monster movie.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00KUCR3LC", "B00IYJRIKO", "B00AEFYSR2", "B000RO9PV4", "B0007R4TR6", "B000CSTKGA", "B000G296X4", "B00HRUQB8Q", "B002NN7EY2", "B00I099JO6", "1606730266", "B000JU8H56", "B0002C9DK4", "B000HT38B2", "B004CZZZEK", "B0002I838G", "B00IA1VKVY", "B000FFJZO2", "B00153ZR8G", "B005ETANC2", "B00K8EVSVI", "B005OT80W2", "6305943133", "B004TPJNAA", "B004S8UTII", "B00AEBB8VK", "B000FGFBUS", "B00005JP4N", "B00HFWETZ8", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B004GF3IJU", "B000A2XA78", "B00BTYXNQE", "B000AQKU72", "B008XTVWHK", "B00005KH30", "B008UFUL6K", "B000HXDWNM", "B001AR0D6I", "B00J81S92S", "B000TUDBFC", "B00I462XF2", "B00IQAUO2A", "0792846885", "B00005LIRD"], "bought_together": ["B00KUCR3LC", "B00AEFYSR2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BTYXNQE", "B00AEFYSR2", "B004CZZZEK", "0792846885"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 41472}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 16.75, "brand": "SHIRE/FOXWORTH/ASSANTE", "asin": "B00005RDAI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41-Bsq6Mz6L.jpg", "title": "Prophecy: The Monster Movie"}

{"description": "A veritable gold mine of rarities and little-known treats,Slapstick Encyclopedialives up to its title as a stupendous compendium of silent-era comedy. Spanning the entire spectrum of slapstick from 1909 to 1927, this definitive collection (curated by film historians David Shepard and Joe Adamson) dutifully credits Keystone Cops creator Mack Sennett as the founder of the slapstick phenomenon. But it reaches far beyond Sennett (who alienated most of his popular stars) to acknowledge nearly every major and minor slapstick star and style. The development of slapstick, which had its roots in vaudeville, is witnessed chronologically, mixing the manic pie-fight sensibility of Sennett's Keystone hits with the lesser-known, more sophisticated parlor-room comedy of Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Drew, while legendary black vaudevillian Bert Williams plies his popular trade in a Biograph short from 1916.Early appearances by Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Fatty Arbuckle, Ben Turpin, Oliver Hardy, Stan Laurel, and others demonstrate the gradual emergence of the popular personalities (like Chaplin's Little Tramp) that would dominate silent comedy at its peak, establishing timeless screen icons and forever altering Hollywood's way of doing business. But the real strength of this set is its wide scope, unearthing neglected talents ripe for rediscovery (like Charley Bowers and Larry Semon), and allowing the viewer to witness the evolution of gags from simple improvisation to the elaborately planned chase-oriented routines that emerged in the early 1920s. With print quality ranging from good to pristine, and original musical accompaniment by six of the world's leading silent-movie musicians, this 18-hour, 50-film laugh-athon is surely one of the finest DVD sets ever produced.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00097DXG2", "B002TCRQNG", "B004XEEMA8", "B00D8HNRBG", "B00AIA89ZA", "B00JRHW4GK", "B008PVQQ3G", "B002A2B348", "B00IPAORL0", "1497372755", "B001FD6MJO", "B000TJ6PHY", "B00FNRA7VW", "B00HE010LC", "B000A7DVMM", "B000B5XORA", "B004YOEGA8", "B00049QQ78", "B00J84NGBE", "B00HMCT8H0", "B00BX49BGQ", "B00BX49C3S", "B00006IUIU", "B00D9BNOKK", "B00D2CRP42", "B005DKS1W6", "B00A1AU6VM", "B005BYBZKY", "B00BY0EBDC", "B00IF0KASY", "B0041T50J2", "B003F10EOI", "B00AFQSZB0", "B001D8W77W", "B00D9BNONW", "B003H221M8", "B000WC8CLU", "B00D4C6780", "B0054602XK", "B0009S4IKG", "B00CPR3RB0", "0615916007", "B0002CHIDS", "B00HFWETIK", "630507559X", "B00GBT61YS", "B004MQ6W5K", "B000F4TMIW", "B004G9UXDK", "B000UAE7K4", "B000B5XORU", "B008BWFOSC", "B008I3Q0FK", "B003N2JKOO", "B0016A2FHO", "B001FB9L3U", "B00895CC90", "1593932685", "B0002CHIEM", "B00BF36ZXC", "B00000JMOO", "B003GOOYT0", "B00K6D1S7A", "B0002CHIEC", "B001QFFBAM", "B007DIQCXG", "B0009S4IJM", "B004RBC5HE", "B00A1AU720", "B007N5YJPC", "B00004Z4W3", "B00B2BYXQI", "B004IF4EYQ", "B000QXDFS0", "B004RBC5QU", "B00AWXI700", "B004RBC5KQ", "B0083V2W04", "B000E1EHQI", "B00HVJZ562", "B008Z0D5L8", "B00FJYXQCG", "B00JSC8BMU", "B002YNQEFG", "B0024FAG8A", "B005SDB7VK", "B008ZDC7M8", "B0083V2VZK", "B000BB14ZS", "B0057IY5EW", "B000E6ESX0", "B00AEBB9QY", "B008MIYKS0", "B003YBNNMY", "B00ARKYSWE", "B0002HOEJY", "B004RBC5M4", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B000E8JO32", "B000XA5K0M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00097DXG2", "B002TCRQNG", "B001FD6MJO", "B002A2B348"]}, "price": 14.62, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 293055}, "asin": "B00005Y6YV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51kv6qd5ihL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Slapstick Encyclopedia"}
{"description": "Gumby, the little green plasticine boy from the toy-land world of Gumbasia, first burst onto TV screens on theHowdy Doodyshow in 1956. By 1957 the landmark children's show had launched its own series of reality-bending adventures. Gumby could walk into storybooks and through mirrors, blast off to the moon and travel back to the dinosaur age, and roll himself into any shape he chose. What kid didn't want to be Gumby?! Over 40 years later the delightful mix of innocence, imagination, and surrealism for kids is just as much fun and still feels unexpectedly inventive--the spacy electronic music alone feels years ahead of its time. Rhino's seven-disc boxed set features over 100 shorts made between 1956 and 1967, remastered from creator Art Clokey's original materials. The age of the series may show in minor scratching and speckling and occasional unsteady frames, but the picture is sharp and the color and sound surprisingly good and the whimsical little shape-shifting boy is as young as ever. The bonus seventh disc features a toy box of Gumby-related goodies, notably interviews with Clokey and original Gumby voice artist Dal McKinnon (quite the ham on camera) and a collection of Clokey's early films, including the inventiveGumbypilot film (sans soundtrack, sadly), gorgeous experimental exercises in abstract art, and two very entertaining marriages of silent slapstick comedy and stop-motion magic.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B000R7HXYM", "B00BC0JFXK", "B0000AZT3Y", "B00125WAV4", "B0000A02WN", "B0009OL98Y", "B0000639HE", "B004VRK4DG", "B0006JB4KA", "B00007UHYV", "B0015DDLC0", "B007AVO1MU", "B00465I1BA", "B0009OL99S", "B000UAE7PE", "B000CIU794", "B007ATHNHC", "B000PC1PAW", "B000E8DB1S", "B0062KMDWU", "B001QU880M", "B0000AZT3X", "B000AOEMU0", "B004ITYDT8", "B008N8A3JE", "B00I2YXN5A", "B004D5D370", "B000M8N41M", "B003M9ZAC4", "B000AA4F2O", "B0000A02WO", "B0000CEB63", "B000AC7OV6", "B000GG4XWE", "B0006HK0PW", "B000GKW92Q", "B00005K22R", "B0008FPKIE", "B00GB0OWR0", "B001VEF7ZM", "0762421835", "B0017QHJNM", "630560925X", "B000MTFDDI", "B00GB0OSVU", "B00C7E3E7S", "B000EQ5PPA", "B000AOEMUA", "B00DY9528Y", "B00009PJT0", "B0037XPPAW", "B007KW5MJU", "B00HZMZ1YG", "B00BCMT4B6", "B007I1Q4MM", "B00JVQ7PWU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000R7HXYM", "B00BC0JFXK", "B0000AZT3Y", "B00125WAV4"]}, "price": 6.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 151855}, "asin": "B0000639HC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RA6SWTBWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gumby - 7 Disc Boxed Set w/Gumby figure"}
{"description": "The seventh and final season ofStar Trek: The Next Generationwill always remain a curiosity in TV sci-fi history. Despite the end being definite, despiteDeep Space Ninetaking over, despite knowing there'd be a movie six months after the series' end, and despiteBabylon 5starting that year with its predetermined story arc, there is nothing here to suggest things were coming to a close. Wesley finally gets dispatched (\"Journey's End\"), but everyone was waiting for that anyway. Some continuity was attempted: there's a sequel to season 1's \"The Battle\" (\"Bloodlines\"), Alexander follows the Klingon soap saga through (\"Firstborn\"), the Maquis and the Cardassians are mentioned several times, and there are final installments for Lwaxana Troi, Barclay, Lore, Guinan, and Ro Laren. None of this brings any form of resolution, however.The one-off story lines seem to throw out ideas that beg for development. \"Force of Nature\" suggests frequent high-warp travel is damaging the very fabric of space/time. \"Parallels\" has Worf experiencing multiple realities, including one in which the Borg won at Wolf 359. \"Lower Decks\" finally introduces some secondary crew from the more than a thousand supposedly supporting Picard and company. There are even hints at some romance at long last between Dr. Crusher and Picard as well as Worf and Troi. In the long run, even after terrific guest spots fromTrekalumni Armin Shimerman and Robin Curtis, and from Paul Sorvino and Kirsten Dunst, there's one thing for which the final year is remembered: \"All Good Things...\" is a near-perfect denouement for the show. With terrific production values and FX, not to mention standout performances from all concerned, it was an amazing surprise to have Q suggest there'd been a story arc right from the get-go. If only this final script had been fully conceived earlier on,The Next Generationmight not have been overshadowed by the glut of TV sci-fi that followed in its wake.--Paul Tonks", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00BHWG0DQ", "B000063V8T", "B000063V8S", "B000063V8R", "B000062XFG", "B00005Y1NF", "B00BHWG0G8", "B00BHWG1AI", "B00005JLF5", "B00062IDCO", "B00062IDLA", "B00008972H", "B000127LW2", "B0002WZTCA", "B000A6CLL0", "B0009I7NGW", "B000AOEMXC", "B0001NBNFW", "B00008KA57", "B00062RCC6", "B000228EBS", "B00008KA5A", "B00062IDDS", "B00008KA58", "B0002JP4GE", "B00008KGT0", "B00008KA59", "B0007TKH66", "B001DHXT6G", "B002I9Z8GM", "B001DHXT3Y", "B000AOEMXM", "B00B7VZN76", "B0095XPZBC", "B00CKYHH6O", "B000HEWEJ4", "B00ENFS0F0", "B0083TUEHY", "6305181721", "B002I9Z8GW", "0671704273", "B00000ILBK", "B0017VG69U", "B0006UEVTA", "B00404ME2E", "B00096S47G", "B00005JLRT", "B00IWTVDUW", "B0000AUHOH", "B002I9Z8I0", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B0019N95IK", "B000BOH8Y6", "B0002XVQNK", "B00AZMFJYA", "B0000UJL96", "B000VDDDY6", "B0002IQKAY", "B008IG0F7G", "B001RHGRTS", "B00CLA3Y2I", "B00CYQXHLC", "B000HWZ4E8", "1451650744", "B00IURL19Y", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B00FFEM0W2", "B000CNE0T2", "B00B5ARKC0", "1451621299", "B002BAW6FE", "B000BT96FA", "B00BAXTY8U", "B00GJT0CXG", "B00198X0YA", "B00008YGRU", "B00F6D62O4", "B006MFQ4DE", "B000A7PKGW", "B000RZIGVS", "B000EXDS34", "B002HQKRBC", "B0024FA9IM", "B002JVWRDG", "B000BOH986", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00JJRLFTU", "B000SAGGL4", "B000BOH990", "B003L77G7Y", "B002I9Z8EO", "B003CN5B7E", "B00022FWEU", "B000BOH98G", "B002GP7ZVO", "B003Y7JWZ0", "B00AGKHC3C", "B009RNK0YC", "B004GZZGVS", "B00H83EUQW"], "bought_together": ["B00BHWG0DQ", "B000063V8T"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000063V8U", "B000063V8T", "B000063V8S", "B000062XFG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 95543}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 74.25, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B000063V8V", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51dvyMs-JsL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek The Next Generation - The Complete Seventh Season"}
{"description": "The original German title, \"Faustrecht der Freiheit\", which roughly translates as \"Might Makes Right,\" describes rather bluntly the crux of this compelling drama, one of Rainer Werner Fassbinder's most acclaimed films. Fassbinder takes a rare starring role as Franz--\"Fox\" to his friends--a gay carny thrown out of work when the cops close a fairground sideshow. Introduced to a group of cultivated homosexuals by an antique and art dealer (Karlheinz B??hm of \"Peeping Tom\" fame), he becomes involved with high-class dandy Eugen (Peter Chatel), who finds the naive, uneducated innocent easy prey when he unexpectedly wins 500 thousand marks in the lottery. Eugen alternately flatters and humiliates Fox, ridiculing his working-class manners and tastes while sponging off his fast-disappearing fortune. The story is partially autobiographical, inspired by Fassbinder's own relationship with an illiterate butcher, but the director casts himself as the victim in the cinematic incarnation and turns his tormentor into a veritable vampire. Biographical considerations aside, it remains one of Fassbinder's most affecting, accomplished, and personal films, and he delivers a sweet, wounded performance as the proletariat Fox in a den of cultured, upper-class hounds. His evocation of the affluent gay community is catty and brittle, but ultimately this powerful drama is less about sexual orientation than class, power, and sexual control. \"--Sean Axmaker\"", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FVGNSM", "B000FWGYU8", "B00008L3WU", "B000065AZB", "B000093NQY", "B00006IUHE", "B0000AKY56", "B0002VEVDO", "B00I567EWS", "B00CUKTHDO", "B00008L3WC", "B00005QAPJ", "B00005JKGX", "B00AIBZLHS", "B002BWP4A6", "B0009WIE8Y", "B000QQFKYE", "B004RBC5PG", "B001152TL6", "B00000F7E6", "B00005JXY5", "B000OVLBGC", "B003D3Y64C", "B000087F79", "B00008V2UE", "B00HVOFP6W", "B0068CEGB8", "B00092ZLEY", "B000VARC2S", "B00004W229", "0780023277", "B0007989Y8", "B00871C09S", "B00009Y3OK", "B00HVOFP08", "B00007M5HB", "B00005Y8UH", "B00005BHW6", "B00009W0U4", "B00GHP8SH4", "B00CQ8HCSM", "B0000C2IV9", "B005VU9LP4", "B004RBC5JW", "B0035ECHIG", "B00062134E", "B000127IF2", "B00005B1ZK", "B00006LPCZ", "B0000C9JFR", "B00008V2UH", "B00006IUHC", "B002LEZ2NI", "B000K0YLX2", "B00006FD9X", "B00006ADES", "1572525835", "B0007OC6ZG", "B004THJ3BC", "B00005KH2D", "B00005U2FI", "B00008V2UC", "B000AQ68W8", "B000059PPP", "B0000687DE", "B000ASKKHU", "B0015I2SNS", "B0013D8LY0", "B000A59PNI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FVGNSM", "B000093NQY", "0140370072", "B000FWGYU8"]}, "price": 27.74, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 208895}, "asin": "B000065AZ9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PRANTGW8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fox and His Friends"}

{"description": "IfBirthday Girlis a far-fetched thriller, it's also a slice of  absurdist fun populated by some awfully interesting actors. Nicole Kidman  plays Sophia, a chain-smoking, mascara-smudged, wildly sexual mail-order bride  from Russia who answers an Internet plea for companionship from a lonely  British bank employee, John (Ben Chaplin). For a while, the two make a  startling and intriguing pair: she apparently speaks no English and he  naively frets over the veracity of the Web business that brought them  together. The gorgeous Kidman and sad-eyed Chaplin are briefly the engine of  their own unique movie, but then the other shoe drops. Sophia, obviously up to  something mysterious, is paid a visit on her birthday by two Russian  \"cousins\" (French filmmaker Mathieu Kassovitz and one of his own frequent  stars, Vincent Cassel, also seen inBrotherhood of the Wolf).  Suddenly, John's quest for a lover becomes a web of deceit and corruption.  Directed and cowritten (with his brother Tom) by Jez Butterworth,Birthday Girlis hampered a bit by sluggishness and insufficient character  development.

{"description": "Baz Luhrmann has coined the termred curtain cinemafor his technique of using theatrical conventions to invigorate films to dazzling and dizzying heights, as shown in the three contained in this set:Strictly Ballroom(1993),William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet(1996), andMoulin Rouge(2001). Luhrmann notes the important characteristics of this style: take a well-known myth or fable and set it in a heightened creative world that the audience can participate in. InStrictly Ballroom, it's both David and Goliath and the Ugly Duckling set in the supercharged world of ballroom-dancing competition. ForRomeo & Juliet, it's the star-crossed lovers transplanted to modern-day Verona Beach yet still peppered with Shakespeare's iambic pentameter.Moulin Rougetakes the story of Orpheus descending into the underworld in search of love then sets it in 19th-century Paris and adds modern pop songs.TheRed Curtain Trilogyincludes these three films in loaded special-edition DVDs (all available separately), with featurettes and commentary tracks by Luhrmann and production designer (and Luhrmann's wife) Catherine Martin among others, and, in the case ofMoulin Rouge, a second disc of features. Fans may opt for this trilogy rather than the separate discs because of its exclusive bonus DVD, \"Behind the Red Curtain,\" the centerpiece of which is the documentary \"Red Curtain Cinema,\" in which Luhrmann explains his theory behind this system of storytelling. It's 20 minutes if you watch it straight through, but numerous onscreen links offer two hours of older interviews, clips from other Luhrmann works, scripts, and an example of the Bollywood style. Other items include a 6-minute tour of the \"House of Iona\" (the home of the Bazmark creative team), and a grab bag of other materials such as all three scripts, DVD-ROM features, and an early example of the \"red curtain\" style, a pop interpretation of a Benjamin Britten opera excerpt called \"Now Until the Light of Day.\" No doubt Luhrmann fans will consider theRed Curtain Trilogy\"spectacular spectacular.\"--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001PPGAIA", "B00DHHWXYY", "B00005BJ2O", "B00006LPE9", "B00000634X", "B00AMEZDPG", "B004M9ZI0M", "B00005YW4Z", "B004SEUJBE", "B000QGE8IS", "B002ZG976U", "B009AJB0YM", "B004SIP9U6", "B002G1K82Q", "B0090XLDKY", "B000MZHW40"], "bought_together": ["B00DHHWXYY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000077VR3", "B004SIPAJG", "B00008G7UJ", "B00DHHWXYY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 76644}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.99, "brand": "Unknown", "asin": "B0000682UD", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JWDDZJ6CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Baz Luhrmann's Red Curtain Trilogy (Strictly Ballroom / Romeo + Juliet / Moulin Rouge)"}

{"description": "The epic sci-fi seriesBabylon 5was a unique experiment in the history of television. It was effectively a novel for television in five seasons, consisting of 110 episodes with a clear beginning, middle, and end. The first season introduces the main characters, headed this year by Commander Jeffery Sinclair (Michael O'Hare) and Security Chief Michael Garibaldi (Jerry Doyle), and familiarizes the audience with the unique environment of a five-mile-long space station in the year 2257.The first episode, \"Midnight on the Firing Line,\" plays at a breathless pace, introducing Commander Susan Ivanova (Claudia Christian) and establishing the conflict between the Narn and Centauri races as represented by their ambassadors, G'Kar (Andreas Katsulas) and Londo Mollari (Peter Jurasik). Then follow several mediocre episodes that initially give the impression thatB5is aStar Trekclone afflicted with \"silly alien of the week\" syndrome. With \"And the Sky Full of Stars,\"B5really begins to hit its stride, Sinclair being forced to relive his mysterious experiences during the Earth-Minbari war. Filler shows such as \"TKO\" are notable only for being controversially violent, while the disappointing \"Grail\" points to writer-creator J. Michael Straczynski's fascination with Arthurian mythology. \"Signs and Portents\" introduces the sinister Mr. Morden (Ed Wasser) and offers the chilling first appearance of the Shadows, an ancient alien threat.B5hits warp speed with a run of exceptional episodes building to the season finale. The two-part \"Voice in the Wilderness\" has Mars breaking into open revolt against Earth and the discovery of a \"Great Machine\" on the dead world Epsilon 3. Referencing 1950s sci-fi classicForbidden Planet, the story leads to the superb  time-travel-based \"Babylon Squared.\" Season finale \"Chrysalis\" proves more than just the usual television cliffhanger, placing Minbari ambassador Delenn in conflict with her ruling Grey Council and forcing on her a decision that laid the groundwork forBabylon 5's eventually becoming a great love story.--Gary S.

{"description": "The third season of Joss Whedon'sBuffy the Vampire Slayerwas marked by the arrival in Sunnydale of renegade slayer Faith (Eliza Dushku), a moody loner who seemed to like her demon-staking calling just a littletoomuch. While Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) was always wary of Faith, the two developed a deep friendship and appreciative rapport--that is, until the evil mayor of Sunnydale (Harry Groener) tapped into Faith's dark side and lured her into his plot to take over the world, first as a double agent spying on Buffy, then as out-and-out nemesis. And as the mayor's ascension approached--which happened to fall on Sunnydale High's graduation day--Buffy and Faith's battles got nastier and nastier, as Buffy attempted to wrestle with her dark side (literally and figuratively), save the world and her friends, and keep her lover Angel (David Boreanaz) out of Faith's evil clutches.Chock-full of exceptional episodes, this third season started out with a bang (the superb season opener \"Anne,\" in which a runaway Buffy finally returns to her Slayer calling) and never let up. Among other highlights, the season introduced former vengeance demon and soon-to-be regular Anya (Emma Caulfield), fleshed out Angel's tortured character (and readied him for his own series), and featured a hilarious doppelganger Willow (Alyson Hannigan), a vampire from a parallel universe, who in Willow's own words was \"evil and... skanky... and kinda gay!\" (Total foreshadowing there, folks.) The season's pi&#xE8;ce de r&#xE9;sistance, though, was the two-parter \"Graduation Day,\" wherein Faith tries to kill Angel, and the students of Sunnydale High prepare to do battle with a mutated mayor and his army of demons. Aside from the series' exceptional writing and acting, this compelling year ofBuffywas anchored by the consistently excellent Gellar, as well as Dushku's complicated Faith, a girl youtrulylove to hate. By the time you finish these episodes, Faith will have cast a spell on you that you'll find very hard to shake.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVM8", "B000EHSVKK", "B000EHSVMS", "B000EHSVN2", "B000I0QLQY", "B000I0QLR8", "B000I0QLRI", "B000I0QLRS", "B000I0QLS2", "B007H9CNOI", "B0006IUE16", "B000HD1482", "B0009W5J4Q", "B000B5XOW0", "B000CCBCGM", "B000ERVJM2", "B000GG4Y6O", "B000JLTRIG", "B000OIOPHC", "B003YF9Q08", "B00344EAQO", "B0000AQS0F", "1593078226", "B00466H3CW", "B005CM1IIE", "B00005JLKB", "1595821651", "B002JVWR4U", "B00JF5G8WU", "B006LG74Q0", "B0024FAR66", "B0001JXPPC", "B00J2T1856", "B00022FWEU", "B00006J3WH", "B0009JE6FC", "B00IKM5LXG", "B00001R3O1", "B000069I1I", "B000CNE0SS", "B000BNI90Y", "B001JAHRME", "1595826106", "B00AMDA2QC", "1442412097", "1595825584", "B00005Y1NF", "159307963X", "B0012Z36F8", "B000X5SPBI", "B003L77GAQ", "B000CNE0TC", "B00133QNS6", "B000EBGFPY", "B001FB4W0C", "B002U8XW9Q", "B001QE99AQ", "B000N6SE4U", "B003R4ZMN6", "0789326302", "B000BOH986", "B009LDCXNY", "B001M5UDGS", "1442412119", "B0018RKEQY", "B000NOKFH6", "B00511N79O", "B002BWP2IK", "B000MX7V66", "B000062XFG", "B00006FD9N", "B00JF5GAZA", "B00133QNSG", "B009LDCWWG", "B00133QNRW", "B000E5KQM8", "B000F3UAE8", "B000FL7CAK", "B000B8QFYG", "B003L77GWE", "B00EIL7E9C", "B00B1RB7TO", "B00191AEYQ", "B0030Y12AA", "B0011FLGZQ", "B000AJJNI6", "B001ILFUA0", "B001MVWRNE", "B000095ZGW", "B000RW3YYA", "B00K0D9760", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B000NA28I4", "B000LC4ZI0", "B000BOH98G", "B000AJJNFE", "B000O77SN6", "B00005JLYW"], "bought_together": ["B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVM8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVKK", "B0046XG48O", "B000EHSVLY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 154783}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 32.59, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B00006RCNX", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RSRJ6FCWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Third Season"}
{"description": "If you don't thinkAustin Powers: International Man of Mystery(1997) is one of the funniest movies of the 1990s, maybe you should be packed into a cryogenic time chamber and sent back to the decade whence you came. Perhaps it was the 1960s--the shagadelic decade when London hipster Austin Powers scored with gorgeous chicks as a fashion photographer by day, crime-fighting international man of mystery by night. Yeah, baby, yeah! But when Powers's arch nemesis, Dr. Evil, puts himself into a deep-freeze and travels via time machine to the late 1990s, Powers must follow him and foil Evil's nefarious scheme of global domination. Mike Myers plays dual roles as Powers and Dr. Evil, with Elizabeth Hurley as his present-day sidekick and karate-kicking paramour. A hilarious spoof of '60s spy movies, this colorful comedy actually gets funnier with successive viewings, making it a perfect home video for gloomy days and randy nights. Oh, behave!\"I put the grrr in swinger, baby!\" a deliciously randy Powers coos near the beginning ofThe Spy Who Shagged Me(1999), and if the imagination of Austin creator Mike Myers seems to have sagged a bit, his energy surely hasn't. This friendly, go-for-broke sequel finds our man Austin heading back to the '60s to keep perennial nemesis Dr. Evil (Myers again) from blowing up the world--and, more importantly, to get back his mojo, that man-juice that turns Austin into irresistible catnip for women, especially American spygirl Felicity Shagwell (a pretty but vacant Heather Graham). The plot may be irreverent and illogical, the jokes may be bad, and the scenes may run on too long, but it's all delivered sunnily and with tongue firmly in cheek. Myers teams Dr. Evil with a diminutive clone, Mini-Me (Verne J. Troyer), then pulls a hat trick by playing a third character, the obese and disgusting Scottish assassin Fat Bastard.Despite symptoms of sequelitis,Austin Powers in Goldmember(2002) is must-see lunacy for devoted fans of the shagadelic franchise. Unfortunately, the law of diminishing returns is in full effect: for every big-name cameo and raunchy double-entendre, there's an equal share of redundant shtick, juvenile scatology, and pop-cultural spoofery. All is forgiven when the hilarity level is consistently high, and Mike Myers--returning here as randy Brit spy Austin, his nemesis Dr. Evil, the bloated Scottish henchman Fat Bastard, and new Dutch disco-villain Goldmember--thrives by favoring comedic chaos over coherent plotting. Once they've tossed Austin into the disco fever of 1975 (where he's sent to rescue his father, gamely played by Michael Caine), Myers and director Jay Roach seem vaguely adrift with old and new characters, including Verne Troyer's Mini-Me and pop star Beyonc&#xE9; Knowles as Pam Grier-ish blaxpo-babe Foxxy Cleopatra. A bit tired, perhaps, but Powers hasn't lost his mojo.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB9DM", "B004H83IJQ", "B00AEBB8LK", "B00005JHVW", "B002BIULKS", "B00AEBBA2C", "B000BKJ762", "B008R65XUQ", "B008R65XTC", "B0013J30YU", "B000MGBSJE", "B002BIULL2", "B00005JMYI", "B003PIUIHO", "630529142X", "0792844890", "B0009ZE9VW", "B00003CXPS", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AJCUL1C", "B00005PJ6N", "B000ELJAEM", "0783235070", "B00000IQBW", "B00AEFXIUK", "B000J4P9P8", "B007D5E7C2", "B00000K3U4", "B001G5T6GW", "B00081912E", "B008R65XMO", "B00AEFXXMI", "B002GSXKNI", "B004H83IOQ", "B0009X761E", "B000K405CY", "B000PHX5P0", "B00AEBB9K0", "B0009HBPN0", "0800141687", "B002GHHHL0", "B00003CXO1", "B00AMSQBRQ", "B00000K3UU", "B00IMYVCGW", "B0045HCJRG", "B006VRRGNK", "B002ZG97TW", "B000ASATYY", "B000EGDBZ6", "B001DJLD1M", "B0039N74CW", "B00HFFE8HE", "B000BBOUCC", "B00AEFXJS6", "B0000C2IQW", "B003HKN52U", "B003Y5H5B0", "B00005JL0I", "B00AEFXPG2", "B005LAIH9A", "B00AJCUL2G", "B000RPCK1U", "B005COLESQ", "B0000AGQ6T", "B00287Z18Y", "B000FP2OPO", "B00AEFYPXY", "B003CRM6PA", "B000WD3XKO", "B002GSXKN8", "B001B1UO6W", "B00005JM7T", "B0002F6BRE", "B00F98FNRS", "B000E33W26", "B0002234LS", "B0009UC810", "B000G0O5I2", "B009RO9LKK", "B000P0J0EW", "B002QEHPQU", "B00AEFYS2M", "B00AEBB9SM", "B00AEFYVMO", "B00AEFXE9U", "B00005JL93", "B0006GANPA", "B001C0JCBA", "B001DPHDB0", "6305433925", "B00005JMJG", "B001AGXEAG", "B000GCFO0I", "B000W9DTG6", "B00AEFZ8OY", "B00005O06J", "B0001Z3TXE", "B00AEBBAEA"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBB9DM", "B00AEBB8LK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["6304696221", "B00001U0BN", "B006HGXGWA", "0792842502"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 145611}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 29.99, "brand": "", "asin": "B00006WUWQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51473A92YSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery/The Spy Who Shagged Me/Goldmember"}

{"description": "Only Kira Nerys would risk going to war over an earring. With the witty and wise second-season opener \"The Homecoming,\" the writers started taking chances with the direction ofDeep Space Nine--and the payoffs are immediate and far-reaching. It's the first episode in a complex trilogy involving the fate of the tenuous Bajoran Provisional Government, an extremist group called the Circle, and a legendary member of the resistance whom Sisko believes might be able to unite Bajor.Continuing its blend of action, mystery, intergalactic politics, and religion, the second season gave prominent parts to Jadzia Dax (\"Invasive Procedures,\" \"Playing God,\" \"Blood Oath\"), Kira Nerys (\"The Collaborator,\" in which Odo gives the first sign of his feelings toward her), the Cardassian Garak (\"Cardassians\"), Odo (\"The Alternate\"), Chief O'Brien (\"Whispers,\" \"Tribunal\"), Commander Sisko (\"Paradise\"), and Quark (\"Profit and Loss\"), and Dr. Bashir developed relationships with both O'Brien (\"Armageddon Game\") and Garak (\"The Wire\").Highlight episodes include the alternate-universe \"Crossover,\" which pays homage to the original series' \"Mirror, Mirror,\" and the two-part spotlight on the Maquis (first introduced inThe Next Generation), a loose-knit organization of disenfranchised Federation colonists who resort to terrorist methods to provoke a new war between the Federation and the Cardassians.  By the end of season 2, the only thingDS9lacked was a really good villain. It got three for the price of one. Turns out the Dominion (first discovered in the underappreciated Ferengi spotlight \"Rules of Acquisition\") is a trinity of evil: the Founders, the Vorta, and the Jem'Hadar, those born-and-bred bad guys whose mission in life is to serve the Founders. The season-closer \"The Jem'Hadar\" is an intelligent, powerful episode that reveals all--and nothing--about the Dominion.--Kayla Rigney", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008KA5A", "B00005JLF5", "B00008KGT0", "B00008KA59", "B00008KA58", "B00008KA57", "B0001NBNFW", "B000127LW2", "B0002JP4GE", "B00062IDLA", "B0002WZTCA", "B00062IDCO", "B000228EBS", "B0009I7NGW", "B00BHWG0DQ", "B000AOEMXC", "B0007TKH66", "B000A6CLL0", "B00BHWG0CM", "B000063V8T", "B000063V8S", "B000063V8R", "B000062XFG", "B00005Y1NF", "B00BHWG0G8", "B00K2CHWYI", "B002BAW6GS", "B00IURL19Y", "B002BAW6H2", "B002BAW6FY", "B001DHXT3Y", "B00BHWG1AI", "B002BAW6FE", "B00L4K3MLE", "B000HEWEJ4", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B0017VG69U", "B000VDDDY6", "B002BAW6GI", "B00HETWFVC", "B00AZMFJYA", "B003H9LIRK", "B002I9Z8GM", "B004EXWGHY", "B000AOEMXM", "B000F8O2OM", "B00IWTVDUW", "B00062IDDS", "B000BOH990", "B0000AUHOH", "B00243FQFA", "B00IWTVDXO", "B001DHXT6G", "B00CKYHH6O", "B000B8IA2G", "B000BOH98G", "B003L77GUG", "B00B7VZN76", "B0095XPZBC", "B0019N95IK", "B0007UDCX0", "B00I40K6RU", "B00F6WXPSQ", "B0042YZFYG", "B003ZFC9M4", "B007USE5CE", "B00ENFS0F0", "B002GP7ZVO", "B000CNE0SS", "0810991721", "B002I9Z8BM", "B000F8O2Q0", "B005X5XI4C", "B00BD6K54G", "B00FFEM0W2", "B00HT851CS", "0671501062", "B0083TUEHY", "B00HRUQAKU", "B002PQ7JQK", "B00GTZWZH6", "B000WTZ6SK", "B00IBKXP8A", "B00K7IPGS6", "B005PPMHWE", "B000CSUNLQ", "B000OONQ9Y", "B002I9Z8I0", "B00018D3RI", "B000RZIGVS", "B000F8O2P6", "B002I9Z8EO", "B00077BPF0", "0671869051", "6305761078", "B002EL4RLQ", "B000CNE0T2", "B00J11U54K", "B003H9LIU2", "B001RHGRTS"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLF5", "B00008KA5A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JLF5", "B00008KA5A", "B00008KGT0", "B00062RCC6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18565}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 34.46, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B00008972H", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51qQ0lhX5RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek Deep Space Nine - The Complete Second Season"}

He finds the perfect victims: attractive, recently divorced Carol Grayland (Meg Foster -- THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK) and her teenage son, Todd (Jonathan Brandis -- HART'S WAR). Posing as a warm and caring family therapist named Gene, he appears to be the ideal second husband and father for these two lonely people. But Carol's best friend Matty (Caroline Williams -- HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS) suspects that Gene is too good to be true. And when Carol's first husband returns to attempt reconciliation, he triggers Gene's fear of discovery, sending him off on a psychotic killing spree. Gene secretly eliminates everyone who stands in his way, until the day arrives to marry Carol, one of the most unforgettable -- and horrifying -- wedding days ever filmed.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002AMVEII", "B0021L8UYY", "B002AMVEIS", "630512003X", "1573625485", "6302499615", "B000TUDFDU", "B00JF5GAIW", "B009IV2Z3M", "B0002VYOVS", "B00005N5RM", "B0002S9QUA", "B0016MJ6P6", "B008DVJNTW", "B00A1AU74I", "157362618X", "1573624101", "B0002DB5PO", "B00005KH30", "B0081XOKH2", "B001B8XRT6", "B000JU7JIW", "B000096I9V", "B00GJ7CUFG", "B00EALTVAA", "B0000ALPFL", "B000TSIJWY", "B005OT7ZWI", "B000UDGO9S", "B008DL4LN0", "B00AGKH4MG", "B003PIUINI", "B000E1ZBIG", "B0001US7OA", "B0053TWW9K", "B00013RC7K", "B00BCMSY80", "B00DTPRZ10", "B000IJ7A5Q", "B00AEFYV9W", "B000WC389G", "B00AEBB91O", "B0021L8UZ8", "B000A6T1ZY", "B00A429Y56", "B0000AOX0F", "B00E5S2HGS", "B000FFJZO2", "B00GHH9GSC", "B00J5BCV3E", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B000QQJ3Q0", "6305137382", "B008CYDD7I", "6305245487", "B00DOZNGTK", "B000F6IOAM", "B00ARWX9NG", "B007XF0W3K", "B000MV8AC2", "B00005K3NZ", "B00BDZV8ZM", "B00347AIOO", "B0053TWV46", "B00EALTVPA", "B000V6LT08", "B000BKDNVM", "B0002IQLH6", "B003JIPN20", "B00H7BJ0C4", "B000IMUYJM", "6305213305", "B003HFUVQI", "B00AUPSR14", "B00079Z9WI", "6305622760", "B001AGNMFI", "B0055CP9TU", "B0053TWVDC", "B00BM4Q4H6", "B00006FI0R", "B00BCMT2BI", "B00005Y1UV", "B0001ZX0GK", "B0055HK79C", "B008G4T7W4", "B002I41KNC", "6305238065", "B0001AVZM6", "B001M0NJ0K", "B00H3N3UV8", "B00GOYHSTC", "B000HT38B2", "B00EL6ACBQ", "B00009WNXA", "B00009PY4C", "B00A429Y9M", "B00HHYGGBE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002AMVEII", "B0021L8UYY", "B002ZG99IG", "B0016MJ6P6"]}, "price": 15.78, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 311695}, "asin": "B000089787", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CDGBRESGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Stepfather II"}

{"description": "Only Werner Herzog could turn the factual story ofInvincibleinto a timeless allegorical fable. This is unmistakably a Herzog film--the director's first narrative feature in a decade--exposing evil in the stage show hosted by the cynical occultist Hanussen (Tim Roth), whose Berlin nightclub entertains Nazi officers on the eve of Hitler's rise to power. This arena of pre-Holocaust amusement is ill-prepared for the disruptive influence of Zishe (Jouko Ahola), a burly Polish blacksmith recruited to play a strongman in Hanussen's act. When Zishe announces his Jewishness to the crowd, thus attracting a Jewish audience to Hanussen's Aryan enclave, his simple act of bravery represents a pivotal affront to Nazi pride, with entirely unexpected results. Finnish body-builder Ahola is Herzog's daring experiment--a nonactor (and it shows) whose likable nature is starkly contrasted with Roth's manipulative malevolence. As Zishe so innocently demonstrates, resistance may be hazardous, but it's not always futile.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003JOOTW4", "B000EPFTY8", "B0001ZX0F6", "B00005YKXQ", "B000BMY2NS", "B002TVQ48K", "0571207081", "B002BWP4A6", "B002TVQ48A", "B000AQ68XC", "B000IJ7AJC", "B000WMA6R8", "B002QVOQ5G", "B000VUQ4HW", "B0014FAIZC", "B000RNUFXM", "B008FO81OK", "B00005R247", "B00860YICC", "B0009KA7D6", "B001DWNUD8", "B0002KPHTW", "B00006LPER", "B0048LPRCS", "B00005JKGX", "B00005R248", "B000059PPO", "6305972761", "B006Z7Z3L8", "B00371QQ0M", "B00006RCNV", "B0007WFYB6", "B0001US62I", "B00441GYZ6", "B000059PPT", "0922915687", "B003UESJMO", "B003XMKUBQ", "B00006LPCZ", "B0009HLBXY", "1905674171", "B0007Y8ABU"], "bought_together": ["B003JOOTW4", "B002TVQ48K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000J3OTT6", "B00A144O5W", "0922915687", "B0014FAIZC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 167716}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.4, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00008Y47R", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51D3E3C5GSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Invincible"}

But in a pinch, Angela Bettis, the star of this 2002 TV remake, fills Spacek's bloody shoes very well. Bettis--who expertly plays a similar role in the indie horror picMay--gets all the loner pathos of poor Carrie White, equally tormented by her cool classmates and her religious-fanatic mom (Patricia Clarkson). Her transformation from doormat to vengeful prom queen remains surefire wish fulfillment for anyone who ever felt a misfit in high school. Despite Bettis's intensity, it's difficult to justify remakingCarriewhenBrian De Palma's 1976 versionis enshrined as a classic of its kind (especially given the pedestrian TV-movie production values on display here).

The \"story\" proceeds to unwind in a series of single-take scenes that unfoldMemento-style, with each scene giving more context to what we have seen previously.  Each scenario depicts actions, dialogue, incident, behavior, and circumstances that the lead characters might have wished didn't happen, ranging from extreme violence through awkward social situations to mild embarrassment. The central character (and possible dreamer of this whole what-if story) emerges as Alex (Monica Bellucci), who suffers the worst in a very hard-to-watch rape sequence in an underpass. Semi-improvised, the scenes all have attack and power as themes, with later/earlier conversational sequences that suggest life isn't all sexual assaults in the dark, showing equal cinematic imagination with the horrors. Arguably, this is not a film most would subject themselves to twice, but it is something that stays in the mind for days after viewing, sparking far more ideas and emotions than most wallow-in-nastiness pictures.--Kim Newman", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005K9O8", "B001MEJY8W", "B00GGY4R3K", "B0048LPRCS", "B001B187L6", "B00125WATQ", "B00003CXXY", "B000FWHW68", "B0048LPRD2", "B002EOVXBK", "B000GI3RHY", "B0014VPFVS", "B003KGBISE", "B003VL3UR0", "B000WMEE9E", "B000WC38EQ", "B000L6S92E", "B0006JMLVQ", "B0082A3HFK", "B005ER6STG", "B00003JRAV", "B00375LBKI", "B001AZKB8K", "B00699G622", "B0040QYRT0", "B00006FDBW", "B0000CABGW", "B00GRZPRB4", "B004BLTNM0", "B000UW8596", "B0009WFEDC", "B004C00EM8", "B0007TZHWA", "B000ARFPMQ", "B005SQRYB4", "B003B2UK1S", "B006UGWDXU", "B00DMUFXOS", "B00JVQ7QTM", "6305228876", "B003L20IEM", "B0032D5ESA", "B00BSU0FQA", "B002EOVXCY", "B001JV5BIA", "B0060AAMEI", "B0000AQS1H", "B002R3CQDC", "B005IGVTM4", "B004LXBKEC", "B003KGBISO", "B00005JMIJ", "B000IMVE32", "B008G1JIQC", "B00006LPER", "B00005U14H", "B00699G6AE", "B001C5LLVE", "B0041KKYCY", "B0043X1FEU", "B00EOBB7LC", "B009OCR2U6", "B000HXDWNM", "B0002DB52M", "B001VG2MAI", "B002C8YSCE", "B0000BWVCR", "B00HW3EJ6Y", "B00AYGVCCK", "B000I8OMEY", "B00023P4I8", "B0009S2T0M", "B003Y5H5G0", "B00LLAV26O", "B00GPPXNIK", "B000X1RYEQ", "B00000IC7G", "B004XZ99FK", "B006Z7Z3VS", "B001PYD0LQ", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B004P2VQZ2", "B001FOK70S", "B00DI67YCU", "B00K0MM4AM", "B0009VRHLK", "B00006FMCS", "B000BGH29K", "B003L20IEC", "B000AC7P5Q", "B0002KPHZG", "B001AIQ14A", "B00APUAKYG", "B00AY6PK5A", "B00284BNKC", "B006OB3K56"], "bought_together": ["B001MEJY8W", "B00GGY4R3K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001MEJY8W", "B00GGY4R3K", "B0048LPRCS", "B001B187L6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 33569}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.13, "brand": "LION&#39;S GATE ENTERTAINMENT", "asin": "B00009W0U4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41GBWP82KQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Irreversible"}

While Riccardo takes on the obstructive Vatican hierarchy, Gerstein must walk a tightrope between documenting and enabling the atrocities his fellow SS officers cold-bloodedly commit.

{"description": "You'd think moviemakers would have run out of new ways of capturing the trials and joys of young love--but director David Gordon Green finds a fresh take inAll the Real Girls, a bittersweet small-town romance. By leaving out the usual humdrum exposition of a courtship story, Green cuts right to the little moments that form the high and low points of a budding relationship. It's an impressionistic style aided by the wonderfully spontaneous and unpredictable acting of Paul Schneider (who also co-scripted) and Zooey Deschanel--who look like they're improvising, even though they're not. As in Green's excellent debut featureGeorge Washington, a small town serves as an atmospheric backdrop--this place looks a couple of decades shy of the 21st century. The mosaic approach makes the film play like a collection of memories, someone's first love recalled with fondness and just a bit of regret.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001CT05JE", "B0028S10YM", "B00180OU70", "B0007R4T3K", "B000F3UA66", "B00005V8TD", "B001DN0V02", "B00HE00XE2", "B0036BDQ4W", "B00K72HVBC", "B001DWNUEM", "B000BYRCQU", "B0002DB52M", "B0012IWHQO", "B0006Z2LGU", "B00K0MM4AM", "B00GS08X2S", "B004UXUWEC", "B00CX7OW1G", "6305801142", "B000069HQ2", "B00G3DA5XA", "B004YCKJSS", "B0010X744G", "B001UV4XUG", "B009OCR2U6", "B00004Z4SD", "B00EL6ADGU", "B000O76TUY", "B003Y5H4W0", "B000CS464G", "B00G5GNZ78", "B0016MJ6I8", "B005KQVE1S", "B00EL6AD5Q", "B000F7CEC0", "B006OB3K56", "B004AE3QYE", "B0002DB4ZK", "B0006TPE4C", "B0036TGTDE", "B0000DZ3DW", "B009POCG0Y", "B00E1LO5J6", "B0000797IO", "B00005V9HI", "B00FGVRZOM", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B00AEFYJ3K", "B000QXDCLK", "B003102JDM", "B003XTOBU0", "B00I4X8KU2", "B002ZG97T2", "B004EQAVHI", "B00CX7OX6U", "B0000VLKVM", "B00FRILRW0", "B00ADRYCWC", "B00FGVRZR4", "B004P2VQXE", "B002QFYJF4", "B00005JLQW", "B004SUDQ72", "B00H3JHC4S", "B00D3LA5WG", "B001MYIXAC", "B00HVOFP6W", "B00003CXKS", "B00000G02H", "B0059XTUB8", "B00DW5IKYS", "B00HUCF420", "B0010DR4BO", "B002BWP4A6", "B006HGXGWU", "B000092T3X", "B002FP1426", "B0016MJ6HY", "B00H9L28OO", "B00BEJL4RO", "B0089XJXRQ", "B004YCKJNI", "B002ONC9NC", "B003SEWMF6", "B00004RE27", "B0036TGTDO", "B002JOUNE8", "B0010X8NF0", "B006PGL7OQ", "B006ZUMP3E", "B0082CWTSY", "B000MX7TXQ", "B00BB22FKO", "B003UESJLU", "B000YV1Q2G", "B003EYVXQO", "B008OHV5R8", "B00008WI9N", "B00HF98SY4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007R4T3K", "B000F3UA66", "B001UV4XUG", "B00005V8TD"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 150873}, "asin": "B00009ZPTY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51V0EA5K3FL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "All the Real Girls"}
{"description": "Lexx's third year had a predetermined 13 episode run, and in a new direction there's also a predetermined continual storyline. This is teasingly set-up by \"Fire and Water\"--the names of a binary planet system. TheLexxis stuck in orbit around 4,000 years after the \"End of the Universe.\" We're introduced to the mysterious Prince (Nigel Bennet) who rules the planet Fire, 790 experiences a shift of devotion, and Xev gets a new hairdo. All threads are expanded by \"May\" (Anna Kathrin Bleuler) who's found on planet Water. All too suddenly, Xev's in love with Prince and Stanley with May. The crew are torn every which way. Even more so when a fleet of new Moths land Kai in \"Gametown\", where the show's most gratuitous nudity yet reassures fans that this third year will be as dangerous and dirty as it's always been.Ralph (Withnail & I) Brown's character Duke suddenly comes to the fore in \"Boomtown.\" These towns teach us more and more about the lifestyles on the two planets, and since this one is essentially a nonstop orgy Stan decides Water is the planet for him! (If the nudity seemed gratuitous in \"Gametown\", that's nothing in comparison.) Ending on a shock appearance by Kai (no spoilers here), a balloon chase leads straight into \"Gondola.\" Lost among the schizophrenic denizens of \"K-Town,\" Stan and Xev are eventually found by the dead assassin whose biomechanical systems are malfunctioning. It takes a shock reappearance of season 2's Universe-destroying Mantrid to make sense of his groin-located repair mechanism. Subsequently split up, Kai suffers the red tape of petty bureaucracy in Hog Town while Stan and Xev descend 39,000 steps to the planet's \"Tunnels.\" Stan bumps into show writer Lex Gigeroff cameoing as insane surgeon Doctor Rainbow, and escape is determined by another death and resurrection from the enigmatic Prince.Stan has been endlessly teased by Xev. They got it together (in a manner of speaking) in \"Love Grows,\" but here at last they experience the \"ultimate in sexual satisfaction.\" Don't they? \"The Key\" metaphorically stands for a number of things in this ship-bound episode, which furthers the season's mystery considerably. And as if the sexual tension wasn't high enough already, the lifestyle offered Stan on the Water planet's \"Garden\" is all too tempting. The biggest lure is the return of beautiful plant gal Lyekka. Following straight on from that cliffhanger ending, \"Battle\" becomes a game of strategic cat and mouse aboard squadrons of hot air balloons. This season's budget helps return the look of the show to its stunning beginnings, and in this episode there are some of the best-conceived effects shots from the entire run. By now it's obvious that each community on the planet Fire is a thinly veiled satire on an aspect of modern society. A splendidly theatrical cameo from Ellen Dubin as Queen allows the viewer to question feminism, bureaucracy, and why the hell Giggerota has been reincarnated to taunt poor Stan.At last all questions are answered in what might as well be a two-part finale. \"The Beach\" would for any other series be considered the clips show: on an idyllic yet purgatorial stretch of sand, Stan is forced to account for his life by viewing events of the past. Judged by his harshest critic--himself--he then suffers all that Prince has promised and more as the true meaning of \"Heaven and Hell\" is revealed. Creator Paul Donovan clearly maintained a strong hand in every aspect of this season, but in directing his own work with these last two episodes we witness a genuinely rare example of personal vision. The narrative has been consistently surprising, but the twist left for last is literally breathtaking. TV sci-fi has never been so sexy and intelligent at the same time.--Paul Tonks", "related": {"also_bought": ["B008R52LA2", "B007AFC0W4", "B001DF681G", "B006LPHY5C", "B0009JE6FM", "B000JLTRHW", "B00F3L8P26", "B0006FO9B0", "B003H9LIU2", "B00404ME2E", "B000ELL1QC", "B001RHGRTS", "B0009JE6G6", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B00061QJSK", "B004XM38CS", "B00E688720", "B00E688AZE", "B000FJH5MC", "B000BCCAEQ", "B0009JE6FC", "B002QU1Z1K", "B0012IX35S", "B0011FLGZQ", "B002GP7ZVY", "B004EXWGHY", "B002GP7ZVO", "B001DW2BG0", "B002GP7ZW8", "B00HUPC5X8", "B002BAW6FY", "B005X4P3DC", "B001IO5C5K", "B0012IX34Y", "B000WTZ6SK", "B00KB614HQ", "B002BAW6GS", "B00E3QJ7JC", "B005GYXO30", "B000CEXFYW", "B000E5N6B6", "B000PHX8RA", "B0051GOB2G", "B002BAW6H2", "B000EDWLMS", "B003PGNBO8", "B000083C4A", "B00007L4O6", "B0081QF6Q8", "B00022FWEU", "B00GTZWZH6", "B002BAW6FE", "B002BAW6GI", "B000AQ69UE", "B004P3HA8I", "B002ZCY872", "B002GP7ZV4", "B00G5UR0SO", "B0037AGB9O", "B000F7CMPE", "B000056PGR", "B000FJH5M2", "B003Y7JWZ0", "B00018D4MM", "B002BWP2IK", "B005CFC04W", "B000BOH8Y6", "B00JK47BHM", "B00466H3A4", "B00170LCWC", "B003L77GWE", "B002USF1UO", "B000BR9SA0", "B000SMNL92", "B006MFQ4OS", "B0056GLNQI", "B00C6F61IW", "B002VA5A02", "B004EXWGJW", "B000FOPPBA", "B00DYQ1GBE", "B00IWTVDUW", "B000053VBW", "B00GX7D5G0", "B0042YZFYG", "B001F7MSH0", "B00B4804LM", "B0049H6RWK", "B002DUJ9Q6", "B00005M0JM", "B0048FUUAI", "B004HYW84G", "B004TJ1H3C", "B0000694VG", "B00005RIWW", "B00005M0JK", "B00IO998U2", "B00A3717C0", "B001CY5N00", "B00CQAQF1A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0006FO9B0", "B008R52LA2", "B00E688AZE", "B00F3L8P26"]}, "price": 0.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 332944}, "asin": "B0000AGWKE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511HGY5G5KL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lexx - The Complete Third Series"}
{"description": "Elijah Wood has one of his first post-Frodoleading roles in this mild-mannered comedy (the title of which wasTry Seventeenin its film festival showings). He's a 17-year-old college dropout who moves into a funky old apartment building and becomes intrigued by his wacky neighbors. Mandy Moore plays the self-absorbed actress across the hall, andRun Lola Rungoddess Franka Potente is a cranky photographer. The movie has a few surprises (the casting seems to suggest a teenybopper romance for Wood and Moore, but not so fast), although the energy level rarely perks up and it's pretty thin on actual narrative happenings. Wood's tendency toward fantasy is an especially tired device. A furtive sense of humor, plus the big adoring closeups of the highly photogenic leading ladies, provides the low-key interest. Trivia:  Elizabeth Perkins plays the hero's irresponsible mom; she was also Elijah Wood's mother inAvalon.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00104AYFQ", "B0000CDRVU", "B000P0J08S", "B0013527IE", "B0016MJ6WO", "B0002OXRSG", "B002DQSKMY", "B00561BNI6", "B00DPUB5EW", "B0010DM3R4", "B000FBNG1O", "B004SEUJ9Q", "B0000524E4", "B002AS463W", "B000XJD35M", "B000GPPNMY", "B00005JPQE", "B0006J28KK", "B000OCZA04", "B00BEIYGQG", "B000F7CEBG", "B0010X8NNM", "B001BN4WL8", "B000083C6R", "B000CQQIDA", "B002TZS5HE", "B003B2UJVE", "B000VS6LSG", "B0002V7SPM"], "bought_together": ["B00104AYFQ", "B0000CDRVU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00104AYFQ", "B0000CDRVU", "B000P0J08S", "B00005JPQE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 136918}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.54, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0000AKCJO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z1002KZSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "All I Want"}

{"description": "The fifth season of Joss Whedon's hit series started out in excellent form as slayer extraordinaire Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) did battle with the most famous of vampires (that Dracula guy) and then went on to spar with another nemesis, little sister Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg). Wait--Buffy has a teenage sister? Where hasshebeen the past four years? And why is everyone acting like she's always been around? Turns out that young Dawn is actually \"The Key,\" a form of pure energy that, true to its name, helps open the gates between different dimensions. To protect said key from falling into the wrong hands, a group of monks gave it human form and sent it to the fiercely protective Buffy for safekeeping, creating new memories of Dawn for everyone as if she'd existed... well, always. Why all the super secrecy? There's this very, very,verybad girl named Glory (Clare Kramer) who wants the keyverybadly, and will do anything to get it. Oh, and by the way, Glory isn't just a run-of-the-mill demon... she'swayworse.Some fans will tell you thatBuffy\"jumped the shark\" with the introduction of Dawn, when in actuality this season was the pinnacle of the show's achievement, as there was superb comedy to be had (\"Buffy Vs. Dracula,\" the double-Xander episode \"The Replacement,\" the introduction of the \"Buffybot\" in \"Intervention\") as well as some of television's best drama. The Whedon-scripted and -directed \"The Body\" remains one ofBuffy's best episodes, when the young woman who faces down supernatural death on a daily basis finds herself powerless in the wake of her mother's sudden passing. The first third or so of the season was a bit choppy, but once the evil Glory came into her own,Buffywas a television force to be reckoned with. Kramer was the show's best villain (after the evil Angel, natch), and the supporting cast was never better. But as always, it was the superb Gellar who was the powerful center of the show, sparking opposite lovelorn vampire Spike (James Marsters) and wrestling with moral dilemmas rarely seen on television. With this season, Buffy Summers became, like Tony Soprano, one of television's true greats.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EHSVMS", "B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVN2", "B000EHSVLE", "B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVKK", "B000I0QLR8", "B000I0QLQY", "B000I0QLS2", "B000I0QLRS", "B000I0QLRI", "B007H9CNOI", "B000HD1482", "B003YF9Q08", "B0006IUE16", "B0009W5J4Q", "B000CCBCGM", "B000B5XOW0", "B000GG4Y6O", "B000ERVJM2", "B000JLTRIG", "B00344EAQO", "B00466H3CW", "1593078226", "B006LG74Q0", "B002JVWR4U", "B00001R3O1", "B000O77SN6", "B00006J3WH", "B0024FAR66", "B0000AQS0F", "B000X5SPBI", "B00AMDA2QC", "1595821651", "1595826106", "B001FB4W0C", "B000O77SMW", "B001AQO43M", "B000EWBNMS", "B0002XVKMM", "B000OIOPHC", "B002JVWRAO", "B000AQN894", "B005CM1IIE", "B000SQFC1S", "B002U8XW9Q", "1595825584", "B00133QNSG", "B003L77GAQ", "B00005JLKB", "B000R7GKQE", "B00JF5G8WU", "B009LDCXNY", "B000P0I4P8", "B004YM6JI2", "B0030Y12AA", "B001MVWRMU", "B009LDCWWG", "B0017MO11O", "B000FP2OPY", "B000AJJNI6", "B000EBGFPY", "0789326302", "B009LDD5XQ", "B0000CABIJ", "B00009MEJT", "B000N6TYLW", "B000QDLSR0", "B009GNI3HY", "B00133QNS6", "B00005JM67", "B009LDD4V4", "B000W089VU", "B00133QNRW", "B0002Y0QV2", "B000CNE0SS", "160010343X", "B00EIL7E9C", "B000F8O2P6", "B00092A1J4", "B000AO9BSS", "B002N5N5MK", "B000GPIPTM", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B001AI774S", "B00BBXSPES", "B003R4ZMN6", "B00005JNOG", "B004X60QWO", "B00511N79O", "B003L77GGK", "B00AMDA2P8", "B001JAHRME", "1442412097", "B004FM2EQC", "B002JVWR4A", "B00006LPCK", "B0010YSD7M", "B0024FAD9C", "B000BOH98G"], "bought_together": ["B000EHSVMS", "B000EHSVLY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVKK", "B000EHSVMS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 130266}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 29.59, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B0000AQS18", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51UKk69E9GL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Fifth Season"}

{"description": "Though it bears little resemblance to the original 1969 thriller starring Michael Caine, the 2003 remake ofThe Italian Jobstands on its own as a caper comedy that's well above average. The title's a misnomer--this time it's actually a Los Angeles job--but the action's just as exciting as it propels a breezy tale of honor and dishonor among competing thieves. Inheriting Caine's role as ace heist-planner Charlie Croker, Mark Wahlberg plays straight-man to a well-cast team of accomplices, including Mos Def, Jason Statham, and scene-stealer Seth Green in a variation of the role originally played by Noel Coward. As the daughter of Croker's ill-fated mentor (Donald Sutherland), Charlize Theron is recruited to double-cross a double-crosser (Edward Norton in oily villain mode), and once again, speedily versatile Mini Coopers play a pivotal role in director F. Gary Gray's exhilarating car-chase climax.

{"description": "A sunny seaside location and the radiant beauty of Valeria Golino are enough to set the mood inRespiro, a fitfully effective Italian film. Hollywood never quite figured out what to do with Golino, but she blossoms in this story about a sensual wife who's either free-spirited or manic-depressive, depending on your perspective. Her fisherman husband (Vincenzo Amato) finally decides to have her sent away for professional help, which only provokes an even more impulsive act from her. Within this story is a pointed critique of male machismo--Italian style. Director Emanuele Crialese veers between the neo-realist tradition and a more Fellini-esque taste for symbolism, never quite settling on one or the other. But the whiff of classic-era Italian film is welcome, and the seasoned, sun-baked presence of La Golino makes this movie compelling even when its point seems obscure.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00598OA2C", "B0018O50VG", "B00003CXXY", "B000I0RNV6", "B004P0IRHE", "B003U4H0CE", "B0043CT9E4", "B000CR8QV6", "B000X418UY", "B002JTMNZ0", "B0002XNSYU", "B004D45NZG", "B0000DZ3BJ", "B000C1VB8M", "B0006JMLVQ", "B004SIP8W0", "B00HRJVHEK", "B000NY1EAS", "B00124SNIY", "B008A1AKK6", "B0000CE684", "6305081034", "B004ODLUIU", "B007AFBYTO", "B005GP7F5W", "B001NI6BJC", "B0019X3YT6", "B0033PQUXA", "B001BXWWOW", "B009SFR2QI", "1423207858", "B000ELJA6U", "B004XVMCLW", "6305291403", "B00782O7LG", "B002X9S6RK", "B004R4PWYY", "B001LMU1C8", "B0083TUE7E", "B006MHZ32K", "B000FUF6SQ", "B0000687FH", "B000F6II1M", "1572228288", "B005CFBZ3O", "B004JPJHKQ", "B006MHZ46A", "0486280853", "B00598O9V4", "B000FWHW68", "B003JMGKPK", "B009RNK128", "B008B9JSD2", "B0001Y4MK4", "B00005JKGO", "B006ITYMVU", "B00JAQJNN0", "0071744738", "0071603344", "B000E3L7M8", "B002U6DVQ2", "1572226269", "0071791264", "B00005QAPH", "0071476946", "B00000I6D4", "B0033AI48Y", "0071600353", "B00000F2L9", "B0046WCM7M", "B00HE010QM", "B003VA3JTK", "B003L20INS", "B000GG4Y32", "B0007Q6VXC", "B005CFC0HE", "B00062134E", "B00008PBYZ", "1423201787", "B000274THQ", "B00008ZZ9K", "B00657PLN8", "0764129546", "B000085OY1", "0471359610", "B00005JKN2", "B0001ZIVAA", "B00AIXVV9I", "B0000DGKI7", "B00A1O0G3G", "B001NH4CIA", "6305308853", "B00000JSJC", "B0012KOM6K", "B004TJ1H1E", "B00006ADG1", "B005KK2FOO", "0139536396", "B004XVMCLC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00598OA2C", "B0018O50VG", "B004SIP6E0", "B000X418UY"]}, "price": 8.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 154022}, "asin": "B0000C23T0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5137W5NY5GL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Respiro"}

{"description": "Building words is an exciting and empowering experience for young children (and frogs) who have mastered individual letters and their sounds. When young Tad wants to nominate his Dad for a \"Best Dad\" contest he asks his brother Leap and sister Lily for some help filling out the application. The three young frogs go see Professor Quigley at their Father's Talking Word Factory for a little instruction and get to watch the \"Sticky-ick-o-rama\" and the \"Word Whammer\" machines at work. Tad quickly discovers that vowels act as the glue that sticks letters together and then learns to combine individual letter sounds to make three-letter words, use common ending sounds to create rhyming words, and blend letter sounds to make even longer rhyming words.

{"description": "Opening with a Dido theme song and featuring character-driven, sweet-natured melodrama,Roswellwas a show with a surprisingly dedicated fandom, who twice won it reprieve from cancellation. One of its main strengths was, of course, the extent to which its premise--alien teenagers trying to sort out their identities while emotionally involved with their human contemporaries--was a free-floating metaphor for race and sexuality issues. Another was the strong ensemble that its cast developed: you believed in the strangeness of the alien trio and the  well-intentioned normality of their three human  friends. Jason Behr gave the alien Max a quiet authority and Majendra Delfino took the sidekick role of Maria and gave it both intensity and fine comic timing. It was also a show in which you were never sure which adults you could trust--William Sadleir trod a fine line of ambiguity as the local sheriff and Julie Benz was silkily sinister as an FBI agent. Anyone who ever loved this show will want these DVDs--and many others may want to find out what the fuss was about.Roswellis presented in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen. The special features include commentaries on six episodes by writer Jason Katims, the directors, and various cast members as well as a featurette on the making of the show and another on its adaptation from the originalRoswell Highseries of young adult novels. The commentaries are unusually insightful on the casting process, and the discs also include the auditions for the part of Tess as well as a deleted scene and a music video.--Roz Kaveney", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00133QNS6", "B00133QNSG", "B000NOKFGW", "B00005YU87", "B001ILFUB4", "B002QZDSW4", "B000O77SMW", "B0002XVKMM", "B000O77SN6", "B000FJH5M2", "B00008AOX3", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B000EHSVKK", "B000092T3Y", "B0000E5NPY", "B00177YA10", "B000AO9BSS", "B00JF5G8WU", "B0002234R2", "B0001907BC", "B000VSDNFA", "B0009A407A", "B0077PTWY6", "B003R0MF6W", "B002BWP2IK", "B00022FWEU", "B000F3UAE8", "B0001IN0T4", "B000FOPPBA", "B001CQONMC", "B0001I55S8", "B0051GOB2G", "B0077PTWHI", "B000YDOOEQ", "B00IWTVDUW", "B00GHH9IAI", "B0009JE6G6", "B000I0QLQY", "B000EAT23C", "B00HQOFAKI", "B000BOH990", "B001MVWRNO", "B002JVWR4U", "B0007V6IW6", "B000I0QLR8", "B002HMTX84", "B00HUPC5X8", "B000BNXD6O", "B00GHH9HBI", "B008X6N8KW", "B0009JE6FC", "B0002RQ3MK", "0671774654", "B001MVWRNE", "B004YPED14", "B003L77GWE", "B0024FAR66", "B0024FAD9C", "B00DPJEWD4", "B00BD6K54G", "B001MVWRMU", "B002CLKP00", "B009LDCWWG", "B000I0QLRI", "B008JFUS0U", "B00JF5GAZA", "B0006J28DW", "0671774662", "B000K7UBX4", "B00BGQ2NIO", "B00005JM39", "B004SMDJ9U", "B000BOH98G", "B0058YPGL6", "B00465I156", "B00127RAGM", "0671774646", "B00BGI086Q", "B00J11U54K", "B006LG74Q0", "B000OCXNQW", "B00GOC74I4", "B001MVWRMK", "B001AQO43M", "B005PPMHO2", "B00466H3CC", "B000EHSVMS", "B000J10KKA", "B000QDLSR0", "B000FIHN8O", "B0012IXBNC", "B00FUABG1C", "B001MVWRN4", "B00166UFTI", "B0011FLGZQ", "B000I0QLS2", "B00005JO9J", "B00ED2IBXE", "B0001JXPPC", "B00AALVINW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00133QNSG", "B000NOKFGW", "B00133QNS6", "B001ILFUB4"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 106839}, "asin": "B0000TPA6K", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TBGR80E9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Roswell - The Complete First Season"}
{"description": "TheUnderworldDVD has a powerful soundtrack that makes good use of ambient noises (e.g., bullet casings pinging on the floor) and has a clear, well-defined picture, which is especially impressive considering the film's predominant look is black leather at nighttime.  The first segment of the four-part, 54-minute documentary is mostly self-congratulation and plot summary (which is not necessarily a bad thing); more interesting are the creature effects and the actors learning how to do their own stunts.  If you were wondering if the voice of the Lycan Raze was really that deep, you can listen to him--actor/co-writer Kevin Grevioux--along with director Len Wiseman and co-writer Danny McBride on the first commentary track as they discuss breaking the rulebook for vampires and shooting in Budapest on a tiny $22 million budget.

{"description": "TheAlien Quadrilogyis a nine-disc boxed set devoted to the fourAlienfilms. Although previously available on DVD as theAlien Legacy, here they have been repackaged with vastly more extras and with upgraded sound and picture. For anyone who hasn't been in hypersleep for the last 25 years, this series needs no introduction, though for the first time each film now comes in both original and \"special edition\" form.Alien(1979) was so perfect it didn't need fixing, and Ridley Scott's 2003 director's cut is fiddling for the sake of fiddling. Watch it once, then return to the majestic, perfectly paced original. Conversely, the special edition of James Cameron'sAliens(1986) is the definitive version, though it's nice to finally have the theatrical cut on DVD for comparison. Most interesting is the alternativeAlien 3(1992). This isn't a \"director's cut\"--David Fincher refused to have any involvement with this release--but a 1991 work-print that runs 29 minutes longer than the theatrical version, and has now been restored, remastered, and finished off with (unfortunately) cheap new CGI. Still, it's truly fascinating, offering a different insight into a flawed masterpiece. The expanded opening is visually breathtaking, the central firestorm is much longer, and a subplot involving Paul McGann's character adds considerable depth to story. The ending is also subtly but significantly different.Alien: Resurrection(1997) always was a mess with a handful of brilliant scenes, and the special edition just makes it eight minutes longer.TheAlien Quadrilogyoffers the first and fourth films with DTS soundtracks, the others having still fine Dolby Digital 5.1 presentation. All four films sound fantastic, with much low-level detail revealed for the first time. Each is anamorphically enhanced at the correct original aspect ratio, and the prints and transfers are superlative. Every film offers a commentary track that lends insight into the creative process--though the Scott-only commentary and isolated music score from the firstAlienDVD release are missing here.Each movie is complemented by a separate disc packed with hours of seriously detailed documentaries (all presented in full-screen with clips letterboxed), thousands of photos, production stills, and storyboards, giving a level of inside information for the dedicated buff only surpassed by theLord of the Ringsextended DVD sets. A ninth DVD compiles miscellaneous material, including an hourlong documentary and even all the extras from the oldAlienlaserdisc. \"Exhaustive\" hardly beings to describe theAlien Quadrilogy, a set that establishes the new DVD benchmark for retrospective releases and looks unlikely to be surpassed for some time.--Gary S.

{"description": "The dark underside ofBoogie Nightsis tracked inWonderland, a sleaze-filled look at the notorious \"Wonderland Murders\" of 1981. The movie attempts to explain how the legendarily endowed porn actor John C. Holmes was involved in the killings, while deliberately suggesting the difficulty of knowing the truth of a murky case. The police procedural aspects turn out to be less intriguing than the weirdly hapless domestic life of Holmes (Val Kilmer at his most dazed), who despite his promiscuity continues to rely on his starchy, clean-cut wife (an unflattering role for Lisa Kudrow, but the most interesting character in the picture). Well-known actors--notably a near-unrecognizable Dylan McDermott--slouch through the story, which rather distracts from the aggressively realistic approach. In the end, the unclean aura makes one yearn for the stylized ingenuity ofBoogie Nights, or at least a reason to be watching this story this way.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["1605420832", "B000PAAJZ6", "B00005NB8K", "B00005JKM2", "B0000C9JE0", "B00005JM23", "B00003CXWV", "B001AK3S4O", "B00441GYZ6", "1593936745", "0792838068", "B00022XE6S", "B000P0J0D8", "B00IKM5MIA", "B00ET2ODTE", "1593936850", "B00009MEKN", "B00004XPPB", "B00049QQHI", "B000087F7Q", "B000EHRVP6", "B002AF4Y9G", "B004SEUJXM", "6301971345", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B00002RAO2", "B00008YJDK", "B00004ZBVM", "B00AEBB89W", "B0000AC8LR", "B000AXWHSA", "B000ZS8GWQ", "B0013D8LKO", "0783229526", "B0001EFV7C", "B000F5GNX8", "B00195I3O0", "B000083C6I", "B00GUO2SKA", "B0009G3B0G", "B00GMV8IVE", "B000GI3KGC", "B0045HCJG2", "B0000542C4", "6305594333", "B00005Q4CS", "B000NO39FG", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000MMMTBY", "B0009A40ES", "B005Z9MFCM", "B00D5XC8PE", "6305313687", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00005A3KS", "B000LAZDPG", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005JMBQ", "B00AFEXRME", "B006LL3W0W", "B000B74GCA", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B002GIBVVQ", "B00070Q7VE", "B002VWNIEA", "B004SIP9CO", "1909394122", "B0009YA3OA", "B0057ZAA6W", "B000A7DVR2", "1558908390", "B000R7HY0K", "0767812182", "B000JMK6LW", "B000P0J09M", "B000BBOUW2", "B00005N89M", "B000R4SMCW", "B001L28J2M", "0780619951", "B0000AM6JI", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00002E20R", "B000069HZP", "B000U1ZV76", "B00005K3NU", "B000K2UVZM", "B00092ZM7U", "B002ZG99N6", "B000FWHW86", "B000002UKO", "6304696558", "B000F1IQN2", "B00FRILRW0", "B00007KK50", "B008FYZI3M", "B0042DN4U4", "B00005QJIG"], "bought_together": ["B000PAAJZ6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005NB8K", "1605420832", "B00005JKM2", "B00HWWUQWQ"]}, "price": 24.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 164098}, "asin": "B00014K58W", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FJ1Qo421L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wonderland"}
{"description": "The epic sci-fi seriesBabylon 5was a unique experiment in the history of television. It was effectively a novel for television in five seasons, consisting of 110 episodes with a clear beginning, middle, and end. The first season introduces the main characters, headed this year by Commander Jeffery Sinclair (Michael O'Hare) and Security Chief Michael Garibaldi (Jerry Doyle), and familiarizes the audience with the unique environment of a five-mile-long space station in the year 2257. The first episode, \"Midnight on the Firing Line,\" plays at a breathless pace, introducing Commander Susan Ivanova (Claudia Christian) and establishing the conflict between the Narn and Centauri races as represented by their ambassadors, G'Kar (Andreas Katsulas) and Londo Mollari (Peter Jurasik).B5hits warp speed with a run of exceptional episodes building to the season finale. The two-part \"Voice in the Wilderness\" has Mars breaking into open revolt against Earth and the discovery of a \"Great Machine\" on the dead world Epsilon 3. Referencing 1950s sci-fi classicForbidden Planet, the story leads to the superb time-travel-based \"Babylon Squared.\" Season finale \"Chrysalis\" proves more than just the usual television cliffhanger, placing Minbari ambassador Delenn in conflict with her ruling Grey Council and forcing on her a decision that laid the groundwork forBabylon 5's eventually becoming a great love story.Delenn's future love interest, Captain John Sheridan (Bruce Boxleitner) arrived onBabylon 5in the first episode of season 2, \"Points of Departure.\" The show marked the handing over of command of B5 to Sheridan from Commander Jeffery Sinclair, actor Michael O'Hare becoming a victim of studio politicians who wanted a bigger star in the leading role. \"Revelations\" explains that Sheridan's wife, Anna, died during an archaeological survey of the world Z'ha'dum, the name being just one of many references to Tolkien'sThe Lord of the Rings(the bridge at Khazad-Dum). \"The Coming of Shadows\" proved to beBabylon 5's finest hour to date, and in \"In the Shadow of Z'ha'dum,\" Sheridan learns that Morden was on the ship on which Anna died. Three exceptional shows conclude the season. The Narn-Centauri war escalates in \"The Long, Twilight Struggle,\" Sheridan faces a most unusual ordeal in \"Comes the Inquisitor,\" and in \"The Fall of Night\" all hope of peace is shattered as a nerve-racking assassination attempt reveals a startling secret about Ambassador Kosh.\"Matters of Honor\" launchedBabylon 5's third season with the introduction of theWhite Star, a spacecraft added to enable more of the action to take place away from the station. Also introduced was Marcus Cole (Jason Carter)--in another nod toThe Lord of the Rings, a Ranger not so far removed from Tolkien's Strider. A third of the way through the season \"Messages from Earth,\" \"Point of No Return,\" and \"Severed Dreams\" prove pivotal, changing the nature of the story in a way previously unimaginable on network TV. Earth slides into dictatorship, the fascistic Nightwatch takes control of off-world security, and Sheridan take decisive action by declaringBabylon 5independent.  \"Interludes and Examinations\" presented the death of a major supporting character, while the two-part \"War Without End\" reached apocalyptic dimensions in a complex tale resolving the destiny of Sinclair and the fate ofBabylon 4, resolving a 1,000-year-old paradox and presenting a vision of a very dark future for Sheridan and Delenn. All this was trumped by the monumental \"Z'ha'dum.\" In the preceding \"Shadow Dancing\" Anna Sheridan (Melissa Gilbert, Bruce Boxleitner's real-life wife) returned from the dead, no longer entirely human. In the mythologically resonant climax Anna invited Sheridan back to the Shadow homeworld with no hope of survival. Just as inThe Lord of the RingsGandalf fell into the abyss at Khazad-Dum, so Sheridan took a comparable leap into the unknown on an alien world.Season 4 began on a high point with the Centauri Prime in the grip of the insane Emperor Cartagia (Wortham Krimmer) and a run of six shows leading to the climax of the war against the Shadows in \"Into the Fire.\" If this colossal narrative was resolved a little too easily and the ultimate aim of the Shadows turned out to be a tad disappointing, it still proved to be the most powerful slice of space opera to ever grace the small screen. In the aftermath the sheer scale dropped back a little but the pace never slowed as the rest of the season played out in one relentless cycle of conspiracy, betrayal and conflict,Babylon 5siding with the rebel Mars colony against the totalitarian Earth.  On an unstoppable wave fuelled by roller-coaster plot twists and spectacular action shows from \"No Surrender, No Retreat\"--when Sheridan avows to overthrow EarthGov--to \"Rising Star\"--when the aim is realized--Babylon 5achieved a consistent excellence rare in television.--Gary S.

{"description": "Like the movie, the DVD extras are smarter and a lot more entertaining than your average flick. The making-of feature (\"Lessons Learned\") has the usual behind-the-scenes banter but Jack Black is in fine form--that is, something special--interviewing as much as being interviewed about the making of the film. His unique pitch to Led Zeppelin to use their song is alone worth the price of the DVD. Black is more his maniacal self and a bit more grating in MTV's Diary segment, but his commentary track with director Richard Linklater is as insightful as it is funny. Ok, it's a lot more funny, but entertaining throughout. The commentary track featuring just the kid actors is less so, but any preteen would love listening to it. To top it off, the DVD-ROM has Dewey Finn's instantly famous blackboard history of rock. You can drill down to the bands mentioned and get a brief history of each.

{"description": "Somebody smart produced the director's commentary track forBig  Fish; they brought in an interviewer to keep Tim Burton on track, thus  avoiding those moments when a director gapes silently at his movie,  grasping for some fresh thought.

There's also a mildly diverting trivia quiz about Tim Burton's  earlier movies.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["1616201649", "B0000YTP02", "B00AEBBAEK", "B0000AC8LI", "B002UOMH00", "B0000VD04M", "B00AEBBA72", "B001AGXEAG", "B001ECDVKE", "B00A8KJK7G", "B000077VR3", "B00H3UKZ6E", "B001HN694K", "B008QE9XD2", "B000K7VHQE", "B0079K4WEE", "1565122178", "B000BB1MI2", "B004A8ZWV0", "B0001ADAVK", "B00005V9HH", "B002ZG980U", "B00447L4JG", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JKIS", "B00006LPGP", "B00003CXRM", "B00005JLSB", "B000P0J06U", "B004SIP7PS", "B00AEFY0F2", "B0006FYOTC", "B000E6ESL2", "B000P0J06K", "B00006JDU8", "B001CK1D44", "B0036TGSR6", "B005LAIIHG", "B00005JMJG", "B000LC55F2", "B00008G8M5", "B0010X73ZG", "B000RJO578", "B000P0J0BK", "B001J9KJ4I", "6305212112", "B00128VA76", "B004U7MR14", "B000C3L27U", "B000F8DBDK", "B00004WG2F", "B001OST0M6", "B000089778", "B00006JMSM", "B0009IOR5M", "B0000AK7AA", "B00005JKJJ", "B00003CXC3", "B003UAKE9Y", "B002VWNIEA", "B0006UEVT0", "B000NO39FG", "B00005NB8K", "B0000640VJ", "B001QOGYBI", "B000O76ZQC", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B000O76T72", "B004SIP92O", "B00008L3U1", "B005I0DV4Y", "B003L20IJM", "0767836324", "B004SEUIXS", "B001HN69AY", "B000A7DVR2", "B00003CXIP", "B000053VAZ", "B001KVZ6FW", "B000P0J0EW", "B000J4P9P8", "B001E1HCRI", "B00003CXZ4", "B0000VD02Y", "B000N6U0E2", "B00AEBB9K0", "B0001XALGY", "B00004Y87O", "B004SIP8W0", "B002GIBVV6", "B004EPYZU8", "B005LAIHYU", "B004SIP6BI", "B0010X8NF0", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000LXH0AE", "B00AEBB9SM", "B00009W5CA", "B002NZK5V4"], "bought_together": ["B0000YTP02"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000YTP02", "1616201649", "B00E8RKHWW", "B00CWM58WY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3909}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.98, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0001GOH6Q", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BHMMY1RSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Big Fish"}
{"description": "This BBC production is a companion to Peter Biskind's 1998book by the same name, an excellent dish on the 1970s American movie scene. It roughly follows the same path, tracing how maverick filmmakers revitalized Hollywood, from Dennis Hopper'sEasy Riderto the triumphant quartet of Coppola/Lucas/Spielberg/Scorsese. Any fan will want to listen in as nearly 50 actors and artists remember the day. However, the star meter is on low wattage, with today's most successful directors only talked about, and seen in often bemusingly vintage clips. The better-produced, higher-star-wattageA Decade Under the Influencecovers much of the same ground. An on-screen Biskind would have helped matters, but he is nowhere to be seen. Yet there are moments from the book that come to life, be it grainy home movies from Jennifer Salt and Margot Kidder's notorious beach house or Roman Polanski's emotional press conference after the murder of his wife Sharon Tate. The DVD boasts a second disc of extended interviews on numerous subjects, many of which were not covered in the 119-minute film.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000AKY7F", "B00009PY57", "6305941122", "0684857081", "B000UJCAKY", "B004MQ6W5K", "B008ZDC7M8", "B00I4X8KU2", "B003S6KGNY", "B00HVOFP6W", "B00K6D1R0I", "B00329PYH0", "B0009HMTEO", "B001I2EQUO", "B00HE00ZIQ", "B00K6D1S7A", "B000AQKV0I", "B0009PVZEG", "B0004Z312K", "B005KLOPTG", "B00HE011DE", "B0013MYB5Y", "B00IY1T8T6", "B000XECFXS", "B001HM2CC4", "B00HT2RTU6", "B005KLOPU0", "B00J2PQZRQ", "0684809966", "B00JGR3M26", "B00I3C1T1Q", "B00004REAG", "B00HRISNPM", "B0002KPHZG", "B00A2XQTIC", "B00J5LXMTG", "B00BJB2GUQ", "B00IMRL2AA", "B00005BHW6", "B00GMM19M8", "B009NUVVVK", "B001EKP5D2", "B00GOT15IM", "B00GMV8KGW", "B00IGK6TGU", "B000W4D94S", "B00F98FOI6", "B002Y58G7S", "B00197POY0", "B00I3C1T34", "B007NQSQT6", "B000286RR0", "B001P3SA8A", "B00BCGUJ5M", "B00GMM19KA", "B00IGK6T9W", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B0024EWP9O", "B0064NTZKI", "B0009GX1CE", "B003KGBIS4", "B00013D580", "B00GICP84W", "B005152C6Y", "B00FMGPWD2", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B001LMU19G", "B00JG88XD8", "B00IVLR9LI", "B000092T5D", "B003152YXC", "B00GBT61YS", "B00D8HNRBG", "B00GPPXNLC", "078323502X", "B0057UA4CW", "B006QS9MKE", "B00005YUO9", "B000BT96DM", "B00FOLGVXK", "B003Y5H5I8", "B007K8ILUQ", "B003D3Y64M", "0671604295", "B000XQ4HR8", "B000244EYW", "0792833287", "B003ELKNH2", "B0035G5IOE", "B00DZP1C3Q", "B000BT96DC", "B00CUKTHJ8", "B00979KQ4U", "B000286RO8", "0805097252", "B0007TKNHO", "B002945DVG", "B00EE8AJ50", "B00GPPXNEE", "B008YAPRPG"], "bought_together": ["B0000AKY7F", "B00009PY57"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0684857081", "B000022TSY", "B0000AKY7F", "B008ZDC7M8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 60944}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "SHOUT FACTORY (UNDER GENIUS)", "asin": "B0001MDQ9E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51T35NHWSTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Easy Riders, Raging Bulls"}

{"description": "The DVD extras forBarbershop 2are much like the movie itself--not  especially inspired or surprising, but raffish and likable. None of the  handful of deleted scenes seem unjustly left out, but a couple  (particularly the ones featuring Cedric the Entertainer) prove  entertaining. Of the two audio commentaries, the one by the director and  producers falls flat, full of a lot of self-congratulation; the less  self-conscious talk from the actors proves more amusing (with Cedric again  providing most of the wit). A couple of music videos (one with Mary J.  Blige and Eve, another with Sleepy Brown and Outkast) are enjoyable, but  the usual outtakes (actors laughing at their flubs) and still photos are  bland and perfunctory.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006RVJR", "B0009X7BFK", "B0002B14UW", "B000098XQ8", "B0014QLEI6", "B00066FAQW", "B001DJLD12", "B000VG66XS", "B000HDZKLO", "B00AEFYHVO", "B0034G4P1C", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B000093I8L", "B00003CY51", "6305505780", "B00005LB86", "B000FS9ULC", "B000069DOB", "0780631234", "B002CA68N4", "B000056BOW", "B00004STUL", "B00177YFYM", "1558908390", "B000YAF4Q6", "B003Y5H56K", "B005LAIH86", "B000RBA6C4", "B00AEFY6TW", "B00005JLQT", "B00004Y2R1", "B00AEFYAC0", "B002VKB0LU", "B002GSXKO2", "B0002J4YVK", "B00124ONGA", "B00HX0KIAM", "B001DJLCQS", "B002VWNICM", "B00004WLTP", "6304821832", "B000PE0GRI", "B00003W8NT", "B000BOH8X2", "B004FPE43K", "B001132GNY", "B003UEYBPI", "B00465I1CE", "B004BZ5AFA", "B0000YEE6M", "0783240201", "B0041QSZS8", "B00AEFYE08", "B001KKU9DM", "B0018RNF60", "B0006GAI5U", "B00005JPK8", "0780627822", "B0013ERFGE", "B0009W5JR8", "B00GOZ2LPM", "B008SOS7W8", "0783237367", "B002CA68MU", "B00066FAVW", "B00008977B", "B002NZK5QO", "B00005RIX5", "B004H83INW", "B002GSXKOM", "B000803BQC", "B00005JND5", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00005JLG1", "B000BITV9W", "B000F9SO0O", "B00005JLON", "B002ZG99RW", "B00066FAC6", "B00005JN4H", "B001P3SA94", "B000XT1P52", "B005LAIH1S", "0767811070", "B002CA68NO", "B00275EHHS", "B000BTITFI", "B0026JI1R2", "0767813901", "B00003GPFT", "B004WJT5E2", "B00E1LQEFE", "B0001MMGC2", "B000XSWVEC", "B000071ZZJ", "B00003CY5Y", "B00000JGHV", "B00005IBN0", "B008B9JTLI", "B0014BQR7Y"], "bought_together": ["B00006RVJR", "B0009X7BFK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00006RVJR", "B0009X7BFK", "B003UEYBPI", "B000098XQ8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 33314}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.19, "brand": "MGM", "asin": "B0001Q4BOE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514P1HEJ83L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Barbershop 2: Back in Business (Special Edition)"}

{"description": "Some crowded Parisian atmosphere and the burnished presence of Omar Sharif make this coming-of-age tale a pleasure. It's the early 1960s, and an adolescent Jewish boy (Pierre Boulanger), mostly left to his own devices by an ineffectual father, makes friends with the worldly wise Persian man (Sharif) who runs a small neighborhood grocery. The kid's fumbling experiences with sexual curiosity are the reliable stuff of many a French movie, but the unlikely friendship of young Jew and old Muslim make for an offbeat through-line. Francois Dupeyron's film shifts gears in its final section, moving from its flavorful location and into the wide-open spaces, and it goes on too long with too many pieces of advice. But overall this is a warm and winning experience, with Omar Sharif holding an instructive class in the power of understated movie-star charisma.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002AG2NTI", "B0084O26SI", "B0007A61K6", "B00IKM5OCO", "B004ZBFRRG", "B0009P7EI2", "B000811672", "B0087IT8FK", "2226126260", "B00421IR5I", "B0000C9JFO", "B000296E7W", "2806213827", "B0002C4JIK", "B001THZAAI", "B00HW3EWQQ", "B000B58DHQ", "B001AZJKKK", "B0069UV0AY", "B003Y7D7BU", "B0001IN0MQ", "B00GMV8B1G", "B0001XALGY", "B001M72J68", "B000UAE7MM", "1590510917", "B00ATK0452", "B002U4F5W2", "6305132917", "B001AMH7XA", "B00CEIOGZG", "B00HUQCA28", "B000YAA68W", "B00005JNCZ", "1609451228", "B0002J4X20", "B000HIVIQU", "B00HRJVHEK", "B00FF9SKQW", "B00GSBMNOQ", "0413775909", "B00GHP8SH4", "B000ECX0O2", "B0002S64SM", "B000NVT0RU", "B000M9BPG2", "B005CKW8BM", "B00EI2CUN6", "B0000A1HQP", "B000N3T0DW", "B002O3Z4WU", "B000YPUFBA", "B007I1Q59E", "B0087OULO6", "B008220DGE", "B00000F7E6", "B009CSVQ8Q", "B005V4X8PO", "B000T0XEGS", "B00APOH5OA", "B00005JNC2", "B0002TSZMO", "B000053VBR", "B000UVV26A", "B004SEUIXS", "B00AIBZLHS", "2070368076", "B000062XE6", "B00166UFTS", "2210754674", "B002BWP3UC", "B00CD6VY6S", "B005HFI7IU", "B000OVLBGC", "B000E1ZBFY", "B00AKGG5WG", "B00AEFYSWM", "B000FVQLRA", "B00320J6WS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001THZAAI", "B00421IR5I", "2226126260", "B0009P7EI2"]}, "price": 20.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 139917}, "asin": "B00023GG6C", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TBKZFAJ7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Monsieur Ibrahim"}

{"description": "Working miracles with only a single set and a handful of characters, Korean director Kim Ki-Duk creates a wise little gem of a movie. As the title suggests, the action takes place in five distinct episodes, but sometimes many years separate the seasons. The setting is a floating monastery in a pristine mountain lake, where an elderly monk teaches a boy the lessons of life--although when the boy grows to manhood, he inevitably must learn a few hard lessons for himself. By the time the story reaches its final sections, you realize you have witnessed the arc of existence--not one person's life, but everyone's. It's as enchanting as a Buddhist fable, but it's not precious; Kim (maker of the notoriousThe Isle) consistently surprises you with a sex scene or an explosion of black comedy; he also vividly acts in the Winter segment, when the lake around the monastery eerily freezes.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000A1OFZA", "B000LPS3A8", "B000S76VHQ", "B0001611CO", "B0000203Z5", "B0009XRZQK", "B005ZOFJNE", "B006C1S1DY", "B00BTFK014", "B00C6F61MS", "B0010SAGHS", "B0009X75HO", "B00008QS9I", "B0053TWVUU", "B000FZEQDC", "B0009ETDCI", "6305090580", "B002P7UCJK", "B0006VL1J2", "B000A5044C", "B000GBEWNY", "B002SF9YNO", "B000059TON", "B00AN5LCXQ", "B000C65YNK", "B004SEUJEG", "B00C6F60NI", "B003Y7F1IW", "B004PXIQDQ", "B003JDQJM8", "B000I8OOG0", "B008XSDTA4", "B00002RAPT", "B0000C2IW7", "B000GSYRY6", "B000V02CUU", "B0019PL2W0", "B000BRBA8S", "B000WMEB1A", "B004CGUBZW", "B000ARG2RI", "B00C7CKEP0", "B0007Q6VXC", "B003DBYCR0", "B000GBEWPC", "B00005JLV7", "B004H2CXBQ", "B000EAT23M", "B000E1EHPE", "B000RTCSIQ", "B00104AYGK", "B0012GVMIK", "6305428360", "B00005JKG1", "B00065GX0K", "B002MZCSW4", "B00004STDA", "B004JOBTRQ", "B00HRJVHEK", "B004CIIXDM", "B008ULEIKO", "B00061I29E", "B0000633R6", "B00005JM6H", "B00023P4N8", "B000065V38", "B00005QFE5", "B00C6WHPO4", "B0007XG5HW", "B003NLE5JA", "B002U4F5W2", "B005JJCMN0", "B001EAV3R4", "B008N9AASC", "B000EOTWIS", "B00003CXUM", "B0009S2T0M", "B0087OULO6", "B00005JKGK", "B0002IRYTA", "B00GX33J7E", "B00166UFA2", "B0033XUHAO", "6305257450", "B00005YRQ2", "B0086460G0", "B0009WIE2A", "B00005JLQW", "6305972761", "B000MRA592", "B008MPQ0R2", "B00HVOFP6W", "B0009VND0E", "B00C6WHSRI", "B00K0MM4AM", "B0009KA2UO", "B00000IOKV", "B00GA9F2PI", "B000AQ68Y6", "B00HE011DE"], "bought_together": ["B000A1OFZA", "B000LPS3A8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000A1OFZA", "B00008QS9I", "B000LPS3A8", "B00AN5LCOA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 92921}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 17.99, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0002J4X20", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516%2BBSVCpCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"}

{"description": "Words like \"delirious\" and \"bizarre\" simply don't suffice to describeForbidden Zone, director Richard Elfman's 1980 musical fantasy that makes its DVD debut after two decades as a cult favorite. Conceived as an extension of the avant-garde theater troupe/music group the Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo (later just Oingo Boingo, which counted Elfman, his brother Danny, and co-scripter Matthew Bright--later the director ofFreeway--among its members),Forbidden Zonetells the story of Frenchy (production designer Marie-Pascal Elfman, Richard's then-wife), who accidentally enters the phantasmagorical Sixth Dimension through a door in her basement. There, her waifish good looks catch the eye of King Fausto (Herve Villechaize), much to the consternation of Queen Doris (the indomitable Susan Tyrell). A frantic, funny, and occasionally profane blend of Fleischer Brothers cartoons, German Expressionism, Depression-era musicals, and '60s underground movies,Forbidden Zoneis definitely not for all viewers, but cult aficionados will be delighted by the sheer energy and imagination of this long-unavailable classic. Supplemental features include commentary by Elfman and Bright, interviews with Danny Elfman, Pascal, and Tyrell; deleted scenes and outtakes; clips from an aborted early attempt,The Hercules Family. (with Danny tearing up \"Minnie the Moocher\"), and Richard's video for Oingo Boingo's \"Private Life.\"--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000014RL", "B000002GC5", "B000002O2E", "B0002RQ3M0", "B00ESZZOLI", "B006UKX6GO", "B00L326LTI", "B000002GC6", "B001FOK70S", "B00ESZZOMM", "B000002L22", "B000002O8E", "B000NY1E8U", "B00HZ67OOW", "B0007WQHI0", "B000002GC7", "B005K8RJME", "B00004Z1GI", "B000002O35", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B000007QEL", "0783228457", "B00I4X8KU2", "B000TZN7KQ", "B008CYDD7I", "B0002RQ3LQ", "B004ZKKKXI", "B008DVJNTW", "B002I41KNC", "B00C7E3EH8", "B00005LIRB", "B000092Q5C", "B000934FC2", "B00005LQ0T", "B00C6QT4CQ", "B000068TPD", "B00009MEKJ", "B00A4KSJOA", "B00004Y7GR", "B00EALTWHW", "B000059H98", "B000S0GYRU", "B000065FS6", "B000784XL2", "B00BLF9FXG", "B000AOEQ4W", "B006M3M5FM", "B000059HAE", "B0006ZE7G2", "B002GHHHG0", "B000QQFKYE", "B0074B2N76", "B007ZFSBWW", "B000063JDE", "B007XF0XUW", "B0011E5M66", "B003WKL6XA", "B0001HAGU6", "B0001LQJMQ", "B000TJ6PB0", "B000FFJZO2", "B004XIWRW4", "B00EVU3S0E", "B00004Y6AT", "B000PKG8TW", "B004P2VQZ2", "B00005JKHX", "B002IT01NC", "B0009X75J2", "B0091G7BTM", "B00023P4UQ", "B005Y1B3EW", "B002RBNNS6", "B00030AZFM", "B003F249MK", "B00027JYLC", "B000A2LV4W", "B00ARWWUYA", "B005MY2J12", "B0002OXUV0", "B004BLTNL6", "B008874968", "B00168OILM", "B0002C4JJ4", "B002CGT0TW", "B0045NXMJE", "B00C7A8WZQ", "B0040QYROK", "B000ION23U", "B009R68H80", "B008DVJOQ4", "B00EOBB7LC", "B001152TL6", "B00EF0NY7W", "B001AZKB8K", "B004ZJ9VXY", "B002WJHDJI", "B00005JOJE", "B000H1RFXM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00B49GSO8", "B000002O2E", "B0001NBMIK", "B00GPPXNIK"]}, "price": 15.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 244034}, "asin": "B0002LE9QS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JQ5BNJA0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Forbidden Zone"}
{"description": "Cheers to Fox for even puttingGreg the Bunnyon the air, and jeers to Fox for yanking it after a mere season (an ignominious fate it shared withThe Ben Stiller ShowandAndy Richter Controls the Universe). Ripe for discovery, this cult-worthy 2002 series took its cue fromWho Framed Roger Rabbit, and anticipated the subversive Tony Award-winning Muppet spoofAvenue Qby imagining a world in which puppets (or, to be more PC: \"fabricated Americans\") live amongst humans. Greg, a sweet-natured bunny, lives with his best friend Jimmy (Seth Green), a slacker whose father, Gil (the inestimable Eugene Levy), is the director of the \"struggling,\" \"low-rated\" children's showSweetknuckle Junction. Greg prevails upon Jimmy to get him a job on the show, but Greg inadvertently finds himself replacing the star. the washed-up Rochester Rabbit. Jimmy signs on as the production assistant to watch over Greg, and to pursue the icy network executive, Alison (comedy siren Sarah Silverman). Rounding out the human cast is gun nut Junction Jack (Bob Gunton) and ditzy, puppet-loving (and we mean that literally) Dottie (Dina Walters).The puppet ensemble is no less impressive than the \"fleshies.\" There's Count Blah, a vampire with aSesame Streetcomplex and a penchant for punctuating his sentences with \"blah\"; Warren \"Professor Ape\" Demontague, a soused monkey with thespian pretensions (and an ongoing feud with neighbor Corey Feldman); Tardy Turtle, an appellation which, unfortunately, does not just refer to his lack of speed, and Susan, a monster who makes Janet Reno look like Salma Hayek. Profanity and crude behavior emanating from puppets is certainly good for some easy laughs (prepare for the worst when adorable laundry icon Snuggles enters a bathroom stall in the episode \"Father & Son Reunion\"). ButGreg the Bunnyplays it smart as well, with sly in-jokes and movie references (catch theKing Konghomage when an enraged Demontague jumps on Gil's shoulders in \"Blah Bawls\"). The show only got better and funnier as its lone season unfolded, making its cancellation that much more keenly felt. AFamily Guy-type resurrection seems unlikely, but what about a Count Blah spinoff? Until then, this features-stuffed two-disc set, complete with clips from Greg's humble public-access beginnings, cast and in-character commentaries, behind-the-scenes segments, and a new Tardy featurette, will really sock it to you.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000H6SY14", "B00153ZS3K", "B0000AUHQE", "B00L3PA8P8", "B0001ZWLYC", "B00008EY6Q", "B002C3GTLC", "B0002JP4DW", "B0000WN15E", "B00H3JJCW8", "B0092QU0YY", "B00ICR6SBI", "B0006UEVUE", "B00HRJVHKE", "B00FPUN57K", "B00I099JSW", "B00022FWEU", "B000FJH5MC", "B0002Q64X4", "B000QFCDAO", "B003UESAXW", "B001PKHS6I", "B004MA1K1M", "B002ZCY84U", "B000H7JCFK", "B000WC39P4", "B0056GLNQI", "B001EN5I3Q", "B000MTEFVE", "B008MIYKN0", "B0055SNHQG", "B00GOG120G", "B003FVB7DU", "B0002EXH54", "B003WJ6VC2", "B0058M0852", "B000A0GP2W", "B00008AOTD", "B008JFUO0Y", "B000FS9MVK", "B000EWBNM8", "B005X4P3DC", "B00B1MJNKE", "B000ARXF7I", "B0001MZ7K0", "B001WAKNCC", "B00GKOJ98E", "B0009JE6FC", "B0009CTV4U", "B0072BNK02", "B00B04NJE4", "B001FACH7S", "B009LDCW1M", "B007ZFR67I", "B0011FLGZQ", "B00AEBB94G", "B0011UBDS6", "B007CO5MVE", "B000ABKHZC", "B008412UQ4", "B0087MN9HO", "B00009IB1D"], "bought_together": ["B000H6SY14", "B00153ZS3K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00153ZS3K", "B000H6SY14", "B0000AUHQE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 36913}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 13.0, "brand": "20TH Century Fox", "asin": "B0002PYSB0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510K92P5S3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Greg the Bunny - The Complete Series"}
{"description": "When a movie can blend passionate social concern with good old-fashioned suspense, it must be doing something right.Maria Full of Gracescores high on both counts. Maria is a Colombian teenager who, for a large paycheck, agrees to be a mule for drug-runners:  she has to swallow dozens of thumb-sized capsules of heroin and smuggle them into New York. This debilitating process is painstakingly described, and of course not everything goes as planned when Maria and her fellow mules land in America. Director Joshua Marston is working on a low budget, which explains the film's narrow, single-minded focus--but this may be a strength, not a weakness. The trump card is the lead performance of Catalina Sandrino Moreno, who won awards at the Seattle and Newport Film Festivals. Her empathetic face carries us along on Maria's journey, and humanizes a problem that is too easily relegated to a headline.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002FHGESI", "B00005JNCZ", "B0041KKYF6", "B000N3T0DW", "B00080Z53O", "B000O76ZQC", "B00005N8A9", "B00180IPM6", "B00008AOX5", "B0036TGSJE", "B008S2NABI", "B000YIGNCC", "B0007NBJHI", "B0042EJDGM", "B000RHRGSK", "B00AZMFKXK", "B005HFI7IU", "B000LV6OC6", "B00005JL57", "B0015ET3YO", "B003A0T8BO", "B004XVMCMG", "B000WC38IC", "B002M2T1VI", "B000N3SU6K", "B001ILTUKQ", "B0052LE7C4", "B005FIXA6S", "B002E01LOI", "B00GJNQ3S0", "B0047685T6", "B00075VX2C", "B00005JLQW", "B000AM4P90", "B001UV4XC4", "B004SIP7S0", "B00006G8G3", "B004SIP6GI", "B00005LZOD", "B0011FLH14", "B004MNM1FI", "B002M2T1V8", "B0086900LG", "B002BWP3UC", "B00E5G03KM", "B000AYEIDQ", "B00134PSV8", "B001FOPOD8", "B0000AMU29", "B00003CXRG", "B0014BQR6U", "B000274TLW", "B000LXHFMW", "B0000C9JFO", "B0001CNQX0", "B00004U1FA", "B00E1S1MMM", "B007961SAE", "B000GETTJI", "B004IF4EVY", "B00F6Y3E26", "B0032AJVE6", "B003O3EKRO", "B003X3BYJM", "B0009HLC9W", "B0000714BS", "B00000F5KH", "B002VECLXC", "B0000714BQ", "B0009S4IGK", "B002FUI4CE", "B00006BS7S", "B00APUAKYG", "B000K2V7F0", "B000SLYE6M", "0764146076", "B0000A2ZTY", "B0002VEZ3U", "1444137697", "B001M5BF7Y", "B000KJU15U", "B001Q56XOA", "B001QX014A", "0070020698", "B001S400C0", "B000VXUW0E", "B00H1RMPH6", "B000QYKDFC", "B000067IZ3", "B000JBXH78", "B00IQIAL8Y", "B007L6VPXC", "B0051T46YG", "B0002DRDIW", "B002EZLPOO", "B000N3T0DM", "B0002RQ316", "B0000U0X20", "B0013HL6ES"], "bought_together": ["B000O76ZQC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00180IPM6", "B0036TGSJE", "B005HFI7IU", "B000O76ZQC"]}, "price": 4.09, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3577}, "asin": "B0002TT0MI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51o4PdGtr3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Maria Full of Grace"}
{"description": "Startling and powerful,Control Roomis a documentary about the Arab television network Al-Jazeera's coverage of the U.S.-led Iraqi war, and conflicts that arose in managed perceptions of truth between that news media outlet and the American military. Egyptian-American filmmaker Jehane Noujaim (Startup.com) catches the frantic action at Al-Jazeera headquarters as President Bush stipulates his 48-hour, get-out-of-town warning to Saddam Hussein and sons, soon followed by the network's shocking footage of Iraqi civilians terrorized and killed by invading U.S. troops. Al-Jazeera's determination to show images and report details outside the Pentagon's carefully controlled information flow draws the wrath of American officials, who accuse it of being an al-Qaida propagandist. (The killing of an Al-Jazeera reporter in what appears to be a deliberately targeted air strike is horrifying.)

{"description": "The first and only spin-off ofBabylon 5, J. Michael Straczynski's short-lived sci-fi seriesCrusadehad its roots in theB5television movieA Call to Arms, in which Earth was battling a Drakh invasion at the end of the Shadow Wars. WhenCrusadebegins, the Drakh have released a deadly virus that threatens to wipe out all 10 billion humans living on Earth unless a cure can be found in five years. To take on this monumental task, Captain Matthew Gideon (Gary Cole) is assigned command of the state-of-the-art Destroyer-class shipExcalibur. His crew includes telepath John Matheson (Daniel Dae Kim); pompous but brilliant archaeologist-linguist Max Eilerson (David Allen Brooks); Dureena, a member of the Thieves' Guild and the last surviving member of her species (Carrie Dobro); medical officer Sarah Chambers (Marjean Holden); and technomage Galen (Peter Woodward).WhileBabylon 5had five years to develop into a powerful saga,Crusadehad its plug pulled after a mere 13 episodes (which were reordered for TNT's broadcast), and the series never really got its footing. Galen often took center stage, then disappeared for several episodes. Matheson was underutilized (other than to provide fans with clues about what happened in the Psi-Wars afterB5ended), and tough-guy Gideon bounced back and forth between his desire to save the human race and his own moral code. There were some good action scenes and intriguing concepts (developed in conjunction with the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory). Special effects sometimes were impressive and sometimes showed budget constraints, and we never really saw the power and scope of the mile-and-a-half-long ship, other than the cool bullet cars used to traverse its length. But it did have its moments. IfB5was the spiritual companion toStar Trek: Deep Space Ninewith its space-station setting and long story arc,Crusadewas more like a traditionalStar Treksetting, with mostly stand-alone episodes involving first contact with various species (even if, due to the nature of theExcalibur's quest, such species were usually extinct). And there were occasional tantalizing hints of a broader conspiracy that might have allowed the series to soar. Regardless,B5fans will welcome even a brief opportunity to revisit this universe, especially when theExcaliburvisits the station in \"The Rules of the Game.\" John Sheridan's ex-wife Captain Elizabeth Lochley (Tracy Scoggins) even earned a spot in the opening credits for her appearance in a few episodes.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004EXWGHY", "B000CEXFYW", "B000PHX8RA", "B002DUJ9Q6", "B002BAW6GS", "B002BAW6H2", "B002BAW6FY", "B002BAW6GI", "B002BAW6FE", "B000JLTRHW", "B000ELL1QC", "B000BCCAEQ", "B00F3L8P26", "B0009JE6G6", "B00005NTNP", "B00404ME2E", "B003H9LIU2", "B0009JE6FM", "B006LPHY6G", "B006P2TA44", "B000FIHN8O", "B001RHGRTS", "B000FJH5M2", "B0006FO9B0", "B001DF681G", "B00KC57IWG", "B000E5N6B6", "B007AFC0W4", "B000FOPPBA", "B004HYW84G", "B001DW2BG0", "B003Y7JWZ0", "B004TJ1H3C", "B0051GOB2G", "B0048FUUAI", "B003ZFC9M4", "B003H9LIRK", "B008R52LA2", "B0042YZFYG", "B0041B77RS", "B00IWTVDUW", "B00402FGE4", "B000BOH8Y6", "B000BR9SA0", "B00BN0WQ5I", "B00GX7D5G0", "B0000V4910", "B00A3718IS", "B000HCO8KE", "B002ZCY872", "B0015LPS1Y", "B002USF1UO", "B00E688AZE", "B00466H3A4", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B003BV8I7C", "B000W4KT9G", "B002GP7ZWI", "B004LROMWU", "B00K2CHWYI", "B00465I156", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00HUPC5X8", "B003PGNBO8", "B00170LCWC", "B0057FGD3Q", "B000WLU5ZM", "B00062RCC6", "B001RTCP1U", "B00L4K3MLE", "B00023BKMC", "B004LROMS4", "B002CLKP00", "B0000AQS0F", "B00KO7NUWO", "B000WTZ6SK", "B00E0KY62O", "B003R0MEYA", "B0007CEXUY", "B00HXEWECI", "B00E688720", "B00E3QJ7JC", "B00K2CHVSK", "B000V5IP6K", "B00ECXJC28", "B002VA5A02", "0345427173", "B00A3717C0", "B002U0KHME", "B00J82PU92", "0739414852", "B00KM5F31O", "B000FJH5MC", "B001RXDM2M", "B001EN71CW", "B002HRF7AW", "B0041OOSMC", "B007XF0XVQ", "B008XJM6H0", "B00HWWUQYY"], "bought_together": ["B004EXWGHY", "B002DUJ9Q6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004EXWGHY", "B002BAW6H2", "B002DUJ9Q6", "B00F3L8P26"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6775}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 15.69, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B00061QJSK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ATW37CMGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Crusade: The Complete Series"}
{"description": "Forget about a three-hour tour--Gilligan's Islandfans can sit right back and enjoy all 32 episodes of the much-loved television comedy and even a few extras with this three-disc set.GIaficionados will probably argue which episode deserves to be called the best in the series' three-year history until the end of time, but few will disagree that its sophomore season (1965-66)  contains some of its funniest and best-remembered episodes. For starters, season 2 marks the show's debut in color, as well as the first time the Professor (Russell Johnson) and Mary Ann (Dawn Wells) were mentioned in the opening theme song (all of this occurs in the season opener, \"Gilligan's Mother-in-Law\"). But it also includes such classic episodes as \"Hi Fi Gilligan\" (Gilligan picks up radio signals in his mouth), \"Don't Bug the Mosquitos\" (faux Brit rockers land on the island), \"Mine Hero\" (a WWII mine washes up on the beach), \"Meet The Meteor\" (space debris makes the castaways age prematurely), and \"The Friendly Physician\" (a mad scientist's experiments cause the castaways to swap bodies), all of which have lost none of their laughs or pure entertainment value.

{"description": "The highly acclaimed, award-winning Turkish filmDistantis a deeply compassionate and frequently amusing study of quiet desperation, prompting many critics to favorably compare writer-director Nuri Bilge Ceylan's subtly hypnotic drama to the films of Ozu and Tarkovsky. Watch closely and you'll recognize someone you know, or even yourself, and the quietest moments are the most enjoyably revealing. Muzaffer &#xD6;zdemir and Mehmet Emin Toprak shared Best Actor honors at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival for their perfectly nuanced performances as (respectively) divorced, 40-something photographer Mahmut and his distant relative Yusef, who arrives in Istanbul looking for work, and quickly wears out his welcome. Tensions mount, revealing solitude as the natural (if not preferred) state of these lonely, melancholy men. (In the context of this film, it's tragically ironic that Toprak was killed in an auto accident, at age 28, six months before his honors at Cannes.) With understated humor, Ceylan observes Mahmut and Yusef's chronic isolation, but he never passes judgment.Distantcould've been made anywhere and it would yield the same visually seductive study of detachment.

{"description": "Geoffrey Rush is in bravura form in his shape-shifting performance as one of the cinema's great chameleons:  Peter Sellers. This higgledy-piggledy biopic races across the high and low points of Sellers's adult life, pretty much sticking to the standard explanation (endorsed by Sellers himself) that his genius for mimickry and impersonation was the result of lacking a personality of his own. Sellers's monstrous treatment of wives and colleagues is balanced by his childlike enthusiasms, all nicely captured by Rush. As for the re-creations of Sellers routines fromThe Goon ShoworDr. Strangelove, Rush gives it a game and sometimes inspired go. Other characters are as incidental as they seem to have been to Sellers himself, with Miriam Margolyes (as Peter's grasping, goading mother) and Emily Watson (patient first wife) especially good. Charlize Theron is Britt Ekland, with little more to do than adopt a Swedish accent. The events chosen to illustrate Sellers's neuroses seem random--from a drawn-out infatuation with Sophia Loren to his feud with Blake Edwards--and the film piles up until Sellers's heart finally gives out.

{"description": "The dazed, dreamlike world of director David Gordon Green remains intact, althoughUndertowhas more story than his previous gems (All the Real Girls,George Washington). In the hot, green Georgia countryside, a man (Dermot Mulroney) lives with his two sons on a farm; their existence is shattered by the arrival of the man's Faulknerian brother (Josh Lucas), a dangerous sort with an ulterior motive. The movie that follows is likeThe Night of the Hunterfiltered through aDays of Heavenlens--there's even aHeaven-like narration provided by Jamie Bell. That's what you get for having Terrence Malick produce your movie. The plot doesn't always sit comfortably with Green's uncanny style--sometimes it feels like an intrusion on a private world of childhood--and Josh Lucas is \"actory\" in a way that most Green actors are not. Green is at his best when noticing some stray detail (the younger brother likes to arrange his books according to smell), not when connecting the dots of story. Still, the images will stick in your mind, Tim Orr's cinematography is superb, and Philip Glass provides a suitably mysterioso score.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000YV1Q2G", "B0040ILVME", "B0000AZT1G", "B000VE4UHO", "B001R88C72", "B0000YTOL2", "B000BX8R1A", "B00005JN0D", "B000OVLBGM", "B000A7Q2I2", "B001FB55XA", "B003Y5H4W0", "B00009ZPTY", "B000I2J736", "B001DN0V02", "B000DBHX4M", "B00005V8TD", "B004SEUIW4", "B00177Y9ZC", "B001ER4CQQ", "B0084CAU2O", "B0034G4P6W", "B00CBFB8SU", "B00HE00XE2", "B0002235P8", "B002MD3USC", "B002UJIY2A", "B003CJXIWS", "B0041LULL2", "B006ISJR7U", "B002SF9YUM", "B00AEFYCL4", "B003PAXOL4", "B000V6LSOA", "B0083H6AQA", "B00IKM5OYW", "B002FG9N78", "B000BQ5J2C", "B00D3LA5WG", "B00BEIYKM6", "B004AE3QYE", "B004KA1DGG", "B00FRH0H3Q", "B004OUZLGK", "B00A47BT7C", "B00005Y4RY", "B00GM5GLDW", "B0034G4P30", "B00IJS2OHM", "B004O26LAI", "B00F8PTALC", "B003EYVXTG", "B00J0IN6Z4", "B00003CXIA", "B00EL6AD5Q", "B0034G4P58", "B000M341SC", "B0009X75O2", "B00GS08X2S", "B0088EDOIK", "B003498SCQ", "B00009MEJ4", "B00K0MM4AM", "B000F8O2QU", "B00FXOO1VC", "B009SFR2QI", "B0037QGS0A", "B00H0EN98Y", "B009T3AE1Y", "B000C20VVE", "B00HUCF420", "B00HUTPKA4", "B003Y5H4R0", "B00HHYF5EI", "B00005Y6XA", "B00EL6ADGU", "B001B1UO7G", "B00D3DJIG8", "B0083V2VYG", "B00CBFB8WQ", "B00000F7E6", "B00GBT62PQ", "B00HE00ZIQ", "B005Z9MFCM", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00003CXPD", "B0001DMVBC", "6305308853", "B00G5GNZ78", "B00GHP8SH4", "B002BWP4A6", "B004ZKKKW4", "B00HF98SHG", "B003Z8ZC2A", "B002ASABF4", "B0000A2ZU3", "B000EDWLLY", "B00F6Y3DFE", "B00023P4N8", "B00HVOFP6W"], "bought_together": ["B000BX8R1A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004KA1DGG", "B000BX8R1A", "B0000AZT1G", "B001R88C72"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 157735}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "Lucas", "asin": "B0007R4T3K", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515X5FZC3FL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Undertow"}

{"description": "Fans ofIce Princesswill enjoy seeing the five deleted scenes, even though like most DVD deleted scenes they wouldn't have added much to the film.  In fact, the alternate opening (an extended scene that flashes back to Casey's earlier childhood) and a later scene would have undesirably softened Joan Cusack's and Kim Cattrall's characters.  Some cut scenes involving Casey and her Snoplow classmates are fun.  The two music videos spotlight key songs from the soundtrack, Caleigh Peters's \"Reach\" and Ally & AJ's \"No One,\" but co-star Hayden Panettiere's \"I Fly\" is a curious omission.  The commentary track follows the Disney trend of featuring its young actors, in this case Michelle Trachtenberg (Casey), Panettiere (Gen), Trevor Blumas (Teddy), and Kirsten Olsen (Nikki, the \"Jumping Shrimp\").  Film aficionados won't learn that much about the crafting of the movie, but the kids have spirit and talk about the \"exploding butt shot\" and who already knew how to skate.  It can be a little tricky to figure which girl is speaking, though.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002WY65V0", "B004CYVZ4K", "B000CCBCAI", "B0007US7C6", "B00005JMCW", "B00063KGPU", "B0024NSFYO", "B00795C5X4", "B000059XTL", "B000FCW15A", "B003B1X85O", "B00005JM9Q", "B00404ME2Y", "B0006SSMWE", "B000209KMW", "B003Y5H52O", "B001B7CO0K", "6305870179", "B000F48D5A", "B004SIP75S", "B00AEFYWQY", "B006X08DZ0", "B000AM4P9A", "B000H5V8CW", "B000324Y98", "B004QIG7CW", "B0001Z3HIG", "B001725ZD2", "B001R3YRIU", "B007I8KXDQ", "B0007LXPBI", "B000B2YR92", "B00005JPO4", "B00062IVN0", "B000ICM5SU", "B0009DWL8W", "B000VAPZM2", "B003PGNBNY", "B0007LXPBS", "B006JTS6XY", "B001KX50B0", "B001NE80P4", "B002WNU0QM", "B000FVQM4W", "B002WNU0OY", "044047731X", "B001G2S3Y6", "B000Y9PC7S", "B002GOAH1U", "B001GC9VK6", "B00GOITWRE", "B0007Z9R66", "B000F2BNW2", "B000JMK6OO", "B007DBGS4G", "B00005JN0Z", "B001FCD252", "B002BIULQ2", "B004IZVMXM", "B000CDSS0Y", "B0006GAOCW", "B00005JMXO", "6305428387", "B0009HLBQQ", "B0007Z9R5W", "B00004Y7D2", "B0013ND3MK", "B00005V9I9", "B004FXQYG2", "B00FKXBECU", "B001H1I8KK", "B000LXHFNG", "B001AR012O", "B001TUZD8O", "B000065V42", "B005EJIG62", "B004FJ87EI", "B000MBUXEA", "B00ANV82HE", "B000JFY05W", "B003NHRIVQ"], "bought_together": ["B000CCBCAI", "B004CYVZ4K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001S3C0M4", "B000CCBCAI", "B00005JMCW", "B000FCW15A"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22973}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B0009JE57G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ESDWWN2SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ice Princess (Full Screen Edition)"}

But in a world where the mundane is transcendent and people seek  meaningful connections despite the risk, anything magical can happen - and well - happen.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004Z29WAI", "0743299418", "1938073010", "3791337335", "B001P3SA8K", "B0006TPE4C", "B000X418V8", "B00H9HZITU", "B00005JLRE", "B004A8ZWVA", "B00005T30L", "B005C7SXMS", "0743299396", "1936365014", "B006KH6CF4", "B00G5GNYY2", "B008220DGE", "B000FVQM2Y", "B000CS464G", "B0010X8NF0", "B00FGVRZOM", "B00007AJF8", "0767827740", "B007L6VR12", "B000M4RG7E", "B0012E2GFK", "B000OCY7JE", "B0007UC8Y4", "B00AG4760C", "B000C20VVE", "B002ONC9NC", "B004SEUIXS", "B00687XNW6", "B003Y5H4R0", "B004A8ZWV0", "B00E0KWB58", "B000JMK6LW", "B0000640VJ", "B00005JMJ4", "B001FOK70S", "B0001O3YV2", "B005KKVAHW", "B00005JL57", "B006X64S7Q", "B0089XJXRQ", "B002T921C0", "B000F6II1M", "B00606P0BM", "B0045HCJ94", "B002M2T1VI", "B00EOBB7LC", "B0002DB52M", "B000TJ6CM2", "B009OCR2U6", "B00003CWTI", "1572527005", "B0021L8UOY", "B00AX7PGQS", "6305428239", "B0036TGTDE", "B000I0RNV6", "B004SIP6GI", "B007WXUVHU", "B006KH6CI6", "B00000IC7G", "B00005JKFX", "B00005JNC2", "B004EQAVHI", "B00009MEB8", "B00005YU1O", "B008OHV49W", "B000YAA68W", "B00AEFXN9G", "B004P7CNC2", "B00003CXGA", "B00ENNA62W", "B00DJYJQ36", "B000E33VWW", "B00BPEJX12", "B00005JLFA", "B00005QW5X", "B000YABYLA", "B00I3C1T1Q", "B0045HCIZY"], "bought_together": ["B004Z29WAI", "0743299418"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0743299418", "B004Z29WAI", "B000CS464G", "3791337335"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 111859}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "", "asin": "B000AMJFYA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5116C62RZ3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Me and You and Everyone We Know"}

{"description": "They billed it as \"the film that outgrosses them all,\" but if some of the antics on display inGood To See You Again, Alice Cooper - Live 1973seem fairly mild some thirty years after the fact, that's mainly because people like Marilyn Manson and some of the more lurid punk and metal acts copped many of their moves from Cooper in the first place. This movie, which combines footage from the band'sBillion Dollar Babiesconcert tour with what might charitably be described as a storyline, had a brief theatrical run in the mid-'70s but has been mostly unseen until this DVD release, which features a high definition transfer and a new sound mix. The group (with its namesake singer joined by original members Michael Bruce and Glen Buxton on guitar, Dennis Dunaway on bass, and drummer Neal Smith) was in the midst of a nice run of hits at the time; \"No More Mr. Nice Guy,\" \"Eighteen,\" and \"School's Out\" are all ably performed here, but it's the stage show in all its Grand Guignol glory that's the prime attraction.Clockwork Orange-style violence, necrophilia, decapitation via guillotine, humping mannequins, sticking baby dolls with swords: that and more is on display here, all in the name of what Cooper, whose commentary track is the major bonus feature, describes as \"performance art.\" Well, maybe. Most of it comes off as little more than a hodgepodge of disconnected images--some vile and vulgar, some merely silly--designed to thrill the kids and piss off the parents, which it most certainly did&#x85; and ain't that what rock & roll is all about? As for the \"story\" (something about a crazed film director out for vengeance after Alice ruins his masterpiece) that's intercut with the concert numbers, the best that can be said about it is that viewers have the option of choosing the \"play concert only\" option.--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B007JZFX42", "B000GCG6AU", "B0000DI4UU", "B0006A9GRM", "1566054834", "B000002KEN", "B000002KBB", "B000002KDS", "B00JPXAOW2", "B008645YXA", "B001HADE0U", "B000FG65SA", "B0099NA3HY", "B000006XSE", "B00JPXAO5E", "B001CBW11W", "B000005S5R", "B0016OMGHY", "B005F6NA4W", "B000006XSD", "B000006XSB", "B0012GN3AU", "B0000C7PQW", "B000B5Y0KK", "B0016OMGI8", "B0012GMUPO", "B000002Q7R", "B000KJU1MS", "B00000G5VR", "1780382324", "B0018M6J72", "B0043DMXGO", "B0012GMYTG", "B0009X75MY", "B000006XSC", "B00005NQGU", "B00EUEWQ2W", "B0082SIPXQ", "B00JQHON74", "B00K6D1FZU", "B0013K1ALE", "B0055IU3GI", "0307382915", "0812992881", "B008RA3MH8", "B000002KI5", "B000002PH5", "B001DWNUF6", "B00FKIB3XA", "B001ASVAM8", "B000MTOR76", "B000006XSF", "B00008YLUX", "B00008OWZC", "B008NR92SI", "B0050JN8BE", "0783233485", "B00HRWJGD6", "B0053TWVFA", "B0007R083A", "6305076995", "B00KACU788", "B005V4X8UO", "B000002SIM", "B00IKM5MJO", "B0000DBJDM", "B004NJC0B6", "B0003035CW", "B004Y1USV2", "B0008GGN1G", "B0043E8YAC", "B000FGG738", "B007EVQAFC", "B005HS00U0", "B009KNKLZW", "B0000E6XJ9", "B00HJ7IO0A", "B00001ODGR", "B001G5T6W6", "B0002MGY5G", "B00IS6EC3E", "B001BET0SC", "B000GAKJAK", "B0085KGGLY", "B00005O6OC", "B003W5C0VM", "B00018D3ZA", "B000VI6T6U", "B0009E3234", "B00005QBZD", "B003YJ8FQ0", "B006T8KT3U", "B0053TWVAK", "B0002CTSXQ", "B000VZBCWE", "B000WUK1T8", "B00F031X62", "B0002GTX8C", "B00BTHWFBK", "0062114042"], "bought_together": ["B007JZFX42", "B000GCG6AU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007JZFX42", "B0000DI4UU", "B000GCG6AU", "B00JPXAO5E"]}, "price": 11.98, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Alternative Rock", "Hardcore & Punk", "Proto Punk"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Classic Rock", "Glam"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Metal"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Vocal Pop"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 29616}, "asin": "B000BCKXT0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QR65K0K3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Good To See You Again, Alice Cooper - Live 1973 - Billion Dollar Babies Tour"}

{"description": "A hilarious comedy about frustrated waiters, stingy tippers and dicey food, Lions Gate Films' WAITING... stars Ryan Reynolds, Anna Faris and Justin Long as young employees battling boredom at Shenanigan's, a generic chain restaurant. A waiter for four years since high school, Dean (Justin Long) has never questioned his job at Shenanigan's. But when he learns that Chett, a high school classmate, now has a lucrative career in electrical engineering, he's thrown into turmoil about his dead-end life. Dean's friend Monty (Ryan Reynolds) is in exactly the same boat, but he couldn't care less. More concerned with partying and getting laid, Monty is put in charge of training Mitch (John Francis Daley), a shy new employee.  Over the course of one chaotic shift, Mitch gets to know the rest of Shenanigan's quirky staff: Monty's tough-talking ex-girlfriend, Serena (Anna Faris), Shenanigan's over-zealous manager, Dan (David Koechner), and head cook Raddimus (Luis Guzman), who's obsessed with a senseless staff-wide competition known only as \"The Game\"...  Featuring crazy busboys, unsanitary kitchen antics, and lots of talk about sex, WAITING... is a hysterical, behind-the-scenes look at the restaurant industry, and an affectionate ode to those lost, and thoroughly unproductive, days of youth.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001MFNB58", "B000EMGJAO", "B000069CF0", "B000LC3ICE", "B000E6EHE0", "B00363WGBO", "B000JJ4DNW", "B000IZJZIU", "B000WZEZGI", "B0023TCWE8", "B000I0RNVQ", "B00AEFYS2M", "B001J9KJ4I", "B000AP04L0", "B001L9EXTS", "B000Y7U93C", "B00AEFZ3XU", "B001OD4S50", "B00AEFXVW0", "B00007AJGM", "B00005JNZU", "B0002V7TMY", "B000031WD9", "B000YW8RN6", "B00260HH1W", "B0016MJ6GA", "B0009P42WI", "B000063RQO", "B00005JKMN", "B002ZG97XI", "B0017JHQPK", "B000BKVQS4", "B004HO6I2E", "B0007DFJ0G", "B004SIP6LS", "B001G5T6GW", "B000M9CB4W", "B00000FA91", "B00005JMX6", "B00005V9HR", "0783230338", "B004SIP8ES", "B00AEFXIUK", "B00029RTAI", "B0009HBPN0", "B001O0TWYK", "B000K7VHOG", "B001KKU9DW", "6301964160", "B00860YIJU", "B000EGDBZ6", "630529142X", "B000J4P9P8", "B000WCN8QE", "B004I9SJH0", "B00005JMYI", "B00AEFY854", "B00003CXPS", "B00AEFYZCU", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B007D0FUTG", "B003Y5H5B0", "B000O77SF4", "B002FU8IWU", "B003PIUINS", "B00003CXWV", "B002IKIHEG", "B004SIP95G", "B008R65XNS", "B002T4GWWA", "B00AEFYAMA", "B0068MNO2U", "B000MCH5RM", "B000BO0L90", "B002ZGW92E", "B005LAIH9A", "B000G0O5I2", "0790729997", "B004EPZ084", "B00009W5F2", "B000N3SU92", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00008WJD6", "B004SEUJO6", "6305222908", "B00DW5IKYS", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B0026BXHQ0", "B00AEBBA2C", "B000OYC7BW", "B002ZG98B4", "B000FKO5QK", "B00029RTCG", "B000TZJBPQ", "B000031EFY", "B0016Q2D66", "B00AG4714S", "B0006HBZEW", "0800141687", "B00441GYVK"], "bought_together": ["B001MFNB58", "B000EMGJAO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00E8RKHWW", "B000AP04L0", "B004SEUIW4", "B000EMGJAO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 11312}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.21, "brand": "Vidmark/Trimark", "asin": "B000CPH9PM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TJVHXCPGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Waiting...

{"description": "Nobody does comic existential angst like Nicolas Cage, who gets a good workout inThe Weather Man, an underrated slice of quiet desperation. Cage plays David Spritz, a Chicago TV meteorologist who knows only too well the constant uncertainty of predicting the weather. Despite a possible offer from a network morning show, David's life is a mess:  he's estranged from his kids and irritated wife (Hope Davis), he's perpetually at odds with his remote father (Michael Caine), and lately people on the street have had the disconcerting habit of throwing food at him. Director Gore Verbinski (Pirates of the Caribbean) has perhaps too heavy a touch for this kind of comic melancholy, but screenwriter Steven Conrad has an interesting, almost Mamet-like ear for \"written\" dialogue--Cage has a few voiceover monologues, including an uproarious sequence involving tartar sauce and a walk to the store, that are hugely funny. It's possible that we've seen Cage in this kind of character one too many times, but he's still good at it, and his doleful face and pasted-on smile fit the mood of the picture. Unlike the heroes of most Hollywood movies, David Spritz doesn't always--or often--do the right thing, but Cage makes you want to see the poor sap make it.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00012QLB4", "B005F2JRUC", "B00005JLRE", "B000JYW5DW", "B000BBOUW2", "B001J710Z2", "B000PMFRZQ", "B000GRUMRS", "B000CNESJO", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B00E8G5HNM", "B000BYA5G4", "B000059TG6", "B004EPYZOO", "B00003CXXG", "B000IFRT5Q", "B001GCUO02", "B00BTYMPX6", "0767810856", "6304806434", "B00006LPGP", "B002TVQ48A", "B002TVQ48K", "B001MLZNLW", "B00441GZ00", "B00000G02H", "B00008L3UF", "0792838068", "B00AEBB8JM", "B00BJB2GZG", "B004XFZ4JK", "B00062IDGK", "B000OVLBF8", "B007IUEEA2", "B000B8I9Y0", "B002GHHHKG", "B00IKM5OYW", "0792844831", "B000NA1WDQ", "076780676X", "B001JIE7JC", "B00005JLSB", "B0007P0X9G", "B00007AJF8", "B00C6F61HS", "6304711891", "B00005JL7Q", "B00005JK8K", "B00005JN5E", "B00004Z4WR", "B004SIP95G", "B00003CXPV", "B00003L9CH", "B00000JGHL", "B00275EHBY", "B00003CWTI", "B0071HPOV0", "B0015OKWKS", "B002VECMAE", "B00HUCF6KK", "B0039UT3LK", "6301971345", "B000EHRVOW", "B00AEFYAC0", "B000H0MKOC", "B005DCJ2DG", "B00007J5VQ", "B002ZG99KO", "B003102JDM", "B0009R1TI6", "B002CPMB9O", "B00BB67UNW", "B000FDEVA2", "B000CBCWRG", "B000066TGP", "B0013D8LC2", "B00020HAX8", "B00005JLO8", "B00005JLFA", "B001P3SA8K", "B002ZG980U", "B0045HCJFS", "B006TTC5MM", "B000DZIGDU", "B000H6SXSI", "B00AEBB9CS", "B000EDWKXI", "B000NIVJF4", "B00062IVM6", "B00009K011", "B0015OKWKI", "B009L79YFU", "B00005JMJG", "B0002W4UDE", "B000286RNE", "B002ZG983M", "B000UJ48SQ", "B000MEYFY6", "B00008EY9G", "B00AEBB9WI"], "bought_together": ["B00012QLB4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00012QLB4", "B000JLTRIQ", "B005F2JRUC", "B000JYW5DW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 132923}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.47, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B000CSUNQQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JTWC5Y4HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Weather Man (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Hooray forHazel! Shirley Booth stars as the irrepressible housekeeper Hazel in the endearing family TV series that ran from 1961 to 1966. A brilliant character actress, Booth wisecracks her way through Hazel's life, solving the problems of her employers, the often-befuddled Baxter family, as well as of the community (busting a shoplifting ring, finding homes for stray dogs, exposing a group of financial swindlers). All this Hazel does with her cheerful working-class enthusiasm, without getting so much as a stray wrinkle in her crisply pressed maid uniform (complete with little head thingy). When she gets into her own scrapes, she shrugs them off with Brooklynese cracks like, \"Looks like I'm in the soup again!\" The show is a perfect snapshot of early 1960s America, complete with frozen-in-time d&#xE9;cor (dideveryonehave that same print of the little-girl ballet dancer framed in their living room?) and a lovely leisurely pace.Hazelcan make an entire episode out of one single premise, as when Mr. Baxter decides that an unlisted phone number might cut down on the number of crank phone calls. And who wouldn't be nostalgic for a time when middle-class households had a working dad, a mostly-stay-at-home mom, perfectly behaved kids--and live-in housekeepers? Part of the appeal of Hazel, though, is that it's clear her life is much broader than her occupation. She knows everyone in town, from the balloon guy at the local park to the most powerful judge on the bench--all of which eventually comes in handy. And did we mention she's a cham-peen league bowler? Booth won two well-deserved Emmys for her portrayal of Hazel. The boxed set includes all 35 25-minute episodes, and you won't want to miss a one. I'm talking to youse!--A.T.

The perfect bank robbery quickly spirals into an unstable and deadly game of cat-and-mouse between a criminal mastermind (Owen), a determined detective (Washington), and a power broker with a hidden agenda (Foster). As the minutes tick by and the situation becomes increasingly tense, one wrong move could mean disaster for any one of them. From acclaimed director Spike Lee comes the edge-of-your-seat, action-packed thriller that The Wall Street Journal calls \"a heist film that's right on the money.\"", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JPD0", "B0000VJG72", "B00005JN0W", "B005LAIGRS", "B002LMV7R0", "B002CPMB9O", "B000244GCC", "B002VWNIEA", "B002ZG997C", "B00005JKWX", "B002XMGGK6", "B0019EXZY4", "078324228X", "B0050MB4OO", "B003L20IG0", "0783240295", "B004A8ZX28", "B002DU39GW", "6304765258", "B0010HOZW6", "B001V7UTV6", "B0006210ZG", "B00AFEXRME", "B00AEBB86A", "6304884400", "B005LAIGLE", "B00AEBB8LA", "B003BV8I3Q", "B002AT8K9W", "B00005JN2Z", "B000BYY11Y", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B004EPYZP8", "B00JA3RVG4", "B001BP4K22", "B002ZG99TA", "B001UV4XRY", "B000P0J0AG", "B000OT6V0K", "B00005JNQA", "B000N6TX1I", "B001N44BVQ", "B00005JA9F", "B007EQR0D8", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00005V9HH", "B00102F5WK", "B000XA5K48", "B0000ACOXL", "B002ZG99N6", "B002GHHHN8", "B00096S49Y", "B00015YVDG", "B000FFL2G6", "B0045HCJFS", "B00008K7AO", "B0000B1OFL", "B00005UQ9T", "B008E70EES", "B000M341QE", "B000I2J736", "B000JYW5BE", "B000MZHW40", "0783226888", "B0012QCZ5O", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B002AT8KAG", "B004XQO90O", "B003Z94WBG", "B007C4ZJ0S", "B002ZG980U", "B000NA1WEK", "B000MXPE7O", "B000FKO5QK", "B0007W7I4W", "6305428115", "B000LC55F2", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEFXBPM", "B000R4SMCW", "B000Y7WGOW", "B000069HZP", "B002ZG999U", "B000K7VHQ4", "B00005JLWN", "B000OYAT3U", "B003ASLJIQ", "B003Q6D2B4", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B00562I40K", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B009HIKAN8", "B00005JKIP", "B00005JLX2", "B00BNH9NCU", "B00BTYOYG2", "B000FS9FCG", "B002ZG97RE", "B0037X40SA", "B00005JLSB"], "bought_together": ["B005LAIGRS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005LAIGRS", "B00005JPD0", "B002CPMB9O", "B00005JN0W"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 137419}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.99, "brand": "WASHINGTON,DENZEL", "asin": "B000GFLKEY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516AC6QFWDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Inside Man (Full Screen Edition) (2006)"}
{"description": "\"Have I got your attention, mister?\" By the time you reach this line in Takashi Miike'sImprint, the answer will be a resounding, horrified \"Yes!\" This much-rumored-about episode of Showtime'sMasters of Horrorseries became notorious as the first installment to be denied an airing. Now that the hour-long episode is out on DVD, it's not difficult to see why the network balked (although on the other hand, if you have a series calledMasters of Horrorand you hire the outrageous Takashi Miike to helm a show, nobody should really be surprised). The story follows an American (Billy Drago) on a journey to a ghostly island bordello in Japan; he's searching for a girl he lost years before. The prostitute he meets has stories to tell--and they abound in incest, abortion, murder, and one of the grisliest torture scenes ever produced for a mainstream outlet.Anybody familiar with Miike's films (Audition,Visitor Q) knows a couple of things about him:  (1) there is no affront against civilized behavior he won't put on film, and (2) he's a heckuva filmmaker.Imprintconfirms this, on both counts. The only weak spot is the English dialogue reading by the Japanese cast--and by Billy Drago, for that matter, although he does look very cool. The story may or may not make sense, but what stays with you are the pregnant, eye-filling images (cinematography by Toyomichi Kurita) and the truly shocking violence. It is really what theMasters of Horrorseries seems designed to do:  give a director complete freedom to merge style with story. Take this to heart, oh ye of low nausea thresholds:Imprintwill seriously mess you up.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00009W0U4", "B0000CABGW", "B001MEJY8W", "B000RL21N6", "B00006FDBW", "B000FS2W3A", "B000RL21NG", "B0009WFEDC", "B00GGY4R3K", "B001VG2MAI", "B000GSYRY6", "B001B187L6", "B005SQRYB4", "B003VL3UR0", "B000CRR3ME", "B0014VPFVS", "B000S1MMCK", "B00125WATQ", "B00005K9O8", "B000UR9QXK", "B000GB5M2Y", "B000E5KUME", "B000KJTFBG", "B004P2VQZ2", "B000PWQP9I", "B000ARFPMQ", "B000FA57W6", "B000NY0YJA", "B000S1MMCU", "B000WC38FU", "B000RIWAV2", "B000UYX4P4", "B000FS2W3K", "B002P7UCJK", "B000HXDWNM", "B000E5KUMO", "B005ER6STG", "B000LPS47K", "B000WC38EQ", "B002EP8FDI", "B000GB5MOW", "B000RL21OK", "B00CU00JTU", "B008NNY8XQ", "B0032D5ESA", "B0082A3HFK", "B00006AUIG", "B00CC2V792", "B000AC7P3S", "B000F3UACU", "B001AZIRYU", "B002DHACSS", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B000KJTFB6", "B000BGH2A4", "B000RL21PO", "157347049X", "B0000AQS1H", "B001I82RVS", "B009XY1X9G", "B000GB5M2O", "B0013D8L7M", "B00CS7PKN0", "B002EOVXBK", "B00699G622", "B000F3UACK", "B0010X73ZG", "B002C8YSCE", "B000OYCMO4", "B0007WQHI0", "B000GBEWNY", "B000QQFKYE", "B000FA57WG", "B00G5GNYY2", "B000FZEQWI", "B00FJX96BC", "B0002C9DK4", "B008G33PIM", "B001RTKKQW", "B000OPPAEM", "B0001ZMXKE", "B0030U1TUW", "B000S0GYRU", "B000Q7ZKWU", "B008DVJOQY", "B008G1JIQC", "B0015ET3YO", "B0091G7BTM", "B00F3OLVHY", "B0060AAMEI", "B00ELQHX5O", "B001152TL6", "B00HW3EJ6Y", "B0009KQOZQ", "B001570H5K", "B0009OUBC4", "B0009S2T0M", "B000CR76U8", "B004BLTNM0"], "bought_together": ["B00009W0U4", "B001MEJY8W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00GGY4R3K", "B000WC384Q", "B00009W0U4", "B000RIWAV2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 115095}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 8.64, "brand": "STARZ/SPHE", "asin": "B000GI3RHY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KGXJ1TZCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Masters of Horror: Imprint"}

{"description": "Lo and behold,Clerks IIdefies the odds as a sequel that even the most ardentClerksfans can be happy about. Twelve years after Kevin Smith turned the independent film world upside-down with his $27,000 black-and-white comedy, perpetual slackers Dante (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson) return for another raucous romp in suburbia, but this time there's no beloved Quick Stop mini-mart to ensure their low-level employment. Now they're aimless 33-year-olds flippin' burgers at Mooby's, a fast-food joint with a cow theme that's \"udderly delicious.\" Dante's engaged to his long-time girlfriend but has unexpectedly fallen in love with Mooby's manager Becky (and since she's played by Rosario Dawson, can you blame him?), and Randal's still holding out for life, liberty, and the pursuit of low ambition. The responsibilities of adulthood are rearing their ugly head, and with Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith) still dealing weed and generally being obnoxious, well... something's gotta give, right? The way Smith has written this long-awaited follow-up, the dilemmas of Dante, Randal, and their ongoing friendship are something that anyone can relate to, and with Dawson lighting up the screen (in a role demanded by producer Harvey Weinstein to boost box-office appeal), the movie's romantic chemistry is surprisingly delightful. Rest assured, also, that Smith (shooting mostly in color this time, on a $5 million budget) hasn't forgotten where he came from:Clerks IIis jam-packed with the same lewd, crude humor that madeClerksan indie-film phenomenon, and Smith's good-natured sincerity is still on full display, ensuring that only the most prudish viewers could possibly be offended. For everyone else, this is as enjoyable as any sequel could ever hope to be, with amusing cameos by Smith-movie veterans Ben Affleck and Jason Lee, among others.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SIP6LS", "B00000IQW4", "B004SIP8ES", "B004XVMCH6", "B007D0FUTG", "B00003CWOL", "B004U7MQW4", "B001KKU9DW", "B005FUTBWS", "B0016MJ6GA", "B00007149S", "B000CPH9PM", "B004SIP6N6", "B001CDFY4Q", "B000I0QLOQ", "B000ICL3L0", "B000EMGJAO", "1592406890", "B001OD4S50", "B000JJ4DNW", "B00068WOH8", "B0018BZEOC", "B005G5NPLA", "B0023TCWE8", "B00363WGBO", "B0002V7TMY", "B007D0FVYA", "B00003CXPS", "B000A7DVR2", "B001J9KJ4I", "0783230338", "B000BBOUCC", "B00009MGEM", "B000093FLA", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000031EFY", "B001C0JCBA", "B006WXHJLC", "B00029LO5E", "B001MFNB58", "0783227434", "B002ZG96ZC", "0800141687", "B008220BGQ", "B00007AJGM", "B0050PYNP8", "B00441GYVA", "B000M9CB4W", "1592407447", "B00BEIYH1A", "B00AEFXVW0", "B000WC3864", "B00AEFZ7F4", "B003VPX5Y4", "0767837398", "B005LAII12", "B000BYA5G4", "B009AMALGM", "B000AARKXA", "B00003CXS7", "B000GBEWGQ", "B000AXWHSA", "B004QL7K70", "0783229526", "B00005JN2Z", "B002O3Z4VG", "B00B4VSUBK", "B000WZEZGI", "B000VXWX7E", "B002ZG97XI", "B00BPEJWAE", "B008RNYMG0", "184856497X", "B00860YIJU", "B004SIP8ZM", "B004EPZ084", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00008975Z", "B00005JM23", "B000IZJZIU", "B003Y5H5C4", "B006TTC50Y", "B004SEUJFK", "B00E1HIX66", "B00005JKMN", "B00005JKHP", "B000069CF0", "B00007ELER", "B009DA743Y", "B001G5T6GW", "B00004TJMW", "B0006HBZE2", "B00005JNZU", "B00029RTAI", "B004UXUWEC", "B0018RKEQE", "6305551235", "B007WW94TW"], "bought_together": ["B004SIP6LS", "B00000IQW4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004SIP6LS", "B00000IQW4", "B0016MJ6GA", "B004SIP8ES"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14519}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.25, "brand": "Weinstein Company", "asin": "B000I0RNVQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51tIUlFx1EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Clerks II (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "If Richard Donner's 1978 feature filmSuperman: The Moviemade us believe a man could fly, Bryan Singer's 2006 follow-up,Superman Returns, lets us remember that a superhero movie can make our spirits soar. Superman (played by newcomer Brandon Routh) comes back to Earth after a futile five-year search for his destroyed home planet of Krypton. As alter ego Clark Kent, he's eager to return to his job at the Daily Planet and to see Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth). Lois, however, has moved on: she now has a fianc&#xE9; (James Marsden), a son (Tristan Leabu), and a Pulitzer Prize for her article entitled \"Why the World Doesn't Need Superman.\" On top of this emotional curveball, his old archrival Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) is plotting the biggest land grab in history.Singer, who made a strong impression among comic-book fans for his work on the X-Men franchise and directed Spacey inThe Usual Suspects, brings both a fresh eye and a sense of respect to the world's oldest superhero. He borrows John Williams's great theme music and Marlon Brando's voice as Jor-El, and the story (penned by Singer'sX-Mencollaborators Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris) is a sort-of-sequel to the first two films in the franchise (choosing to ignore that the third and fourth movies ever happened). The humorous and romantic elements give the movie a heart, Singer's art-deco Metropolis is often breathtaking, and the special effects are elegant and spectacular, particularly an early airplane-disaster set-piece. Of the cast, Routh is excellent as the dual Superman/Clark, Spacey is both droll and vicious as Luthor, and Parker Posey gets the best lines as Luthor's moll Kitty. But at 23, Bosworth seems too young for the five-years-past-grizzled Lois. It's nice to see Noel Neill, Jack Larson (both from the classicAdventures of SupermanTV series), and Eva Marie-Saint on the screen as well. Superman Returns is one of those projects that was in development for seemingly forever, but it was worth the wait -- it's the most enjoyable superhero movie sinceSpider-Man 2andThe Incredibles.--David HoriuchiMore SupermanWatch our exclusive interviews with the cast ofSuperman ReturnsOther feature filmsSuperman in high definitionSmallvilleAdventures of SupermanSee all Superman DVDs", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001DJLD2G", "B000IJ79VQ", "B000IJ79X4", "B000IJ79XE", "B000IJ79WU", "B008JFUPFI", "B000IJ79UW", "B001CDR1FG", "B000ION23U", "B002GSXKN8", "B004EPZ07K", "B0000959N0", "B00005JNTU", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001DHXT20", "B000VI70QS", "B0006L0LOS", "B0007P0Y7C", "B000UR9T8C", "B00005JNJV", "B00005JMQW", "B00005JKCH", "B000AYELVU", "B004LWZW42", "B0090SI56Y", "B001OST0LW", "B001OST0M6", "B001QB9H1U", "B000HCO83Q", "B000PE0G0A", "B001GCUO1Q", "B0002IQMAM", "B004LWZWGA", "B008JFUS0U", "B000P0J06K", "B000OVLBF8", "B00E5I2MCM", "B003YAR97K", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00080ZG2O", "B003QO8TOQ", "B001FB55HQ", "B005LAIGW8", "B000I8OM94", "B000FO0AHY", "B00IZZDWKM", "B000P0J06U", "B0007V6ITE", "B008JFUO72", "B000AYELVA", "B002NXSRVG", "B00DYEN6XC", "B00E5I2MEK", "B000BT96EG", "B001HQZJMU", "B001QTXM5Y", "B00E5I2M6I", "B002HWRYJE", "B00E5I2M9K", "B001614E68", "B000059Z8L", "B001VLBDD0", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B000EU1Q2M", "B000KJU1KK", "B00BTYMPUY", "B000H30B2C", "B001F7MSFM", "B0013BM63O", "B00F4FFO8E", "B000EGDB10", "B00008G8M5", "B00JPS7HOA", "0790738953", "B000B7QCGS", "B000HWZ4E8", "B00BBXSPES", "B000FMGTTE", "B0083SBMBM", "B003Z8ZCDO", "B005LAII44", "B000P6XQ50", "B000VI28Z6", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001RHGRT8", "B000F4RH8E", "B002ZG99B8", "B001AK3S4Y", "B00005JL78", "B0002ZMHX6", "B0007G89FU", "B006VRRGNK", "B00BBAQD6S", "B009JBWOU0", "B000BT96FA", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00BGI086Q", "B003UN2ICM", "B0000VCZMK"], "bought_together": ["B008JFUPFI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008JFUPFI", "B00F4FFO8E", "B001DJLD2G", "B000IJ79UW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 57565}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.73, "brand": "DC Comics", "asin": "B000J10EQU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ddmxk8VML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Superman Returns (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Sweet baby Jesus, we thank you for blessing Will Ferrell and Adam McKay with the talent to create a NASCAR comedy as hilarious asTalladega Nights. The so-called \"Ballad of Ricky Bobby\" is hardly flawless  in fact it's not always firing on all cylinders  but with comedy star Ferrell and director McKay still hot from the success of their previous comedy hitAnchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, most of this 108-minute spoof of oval-track racing is so knee-slappin' funny that you can't help but surrender to the stupidity.Obviously, Ferrell's the shining star, and his portrayal of lead-footed pit-crew-member-turned-#1 NASCAR champion Ricky \"I Wanna Go Fast\" Bobby (how can you not love that name?) is spot-on perfect, righteously spoofing the entirety of NASCAR culture without insulting its oft-ridiculed roots in redneck bootlegging of a bygone era. You could even argue that Talladega Nights is truer to NASCAR than Tom Cruise'sDays of Thunder, and it's certainly more entertaining, especially when you add John C. Reilly as Ricky's life-long pal, teammate, and eventual rival Cal Naughton, Jr. (together they're nicknamed \"Shake 'n Bake\"), and Sacha Baron Cohen (fromDa Ali G ShowandBorat) as gay French \"Formula Un\" driver-turned NASCAR rival Jean Girrard, to a stellar cast including Molly Shannon, Greg Germann, Amy Adams and Michael Clarke Duncan.Sure, it's mostly a showcase for Ferrell's loud, over-the-top antics and nonsensical non sequiturs (like cameo appearances by Elvis Costello and Mos Def), but with Ferrell behind the wheel,Talladega Nightsrolls into victory lane with fuel to spare, and there's one final bit of comedy (with a tip of the hat to William Faulkner) for those who sit through the credits. --Jeff ShannonStills fromTalladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby(click for larger image)More NASCAR andTalladega Nightsat Amazon.comThe CalendarOn blu-rayNASCAR on PSPOur NASCAR StoreNASCAR The Imax ExperienceSpeed, Guts, and GloryBookOther Will Ferrell FilmsAnchor ManElfThe Best of Will FerrellMore Films by Will Ferrell", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000WZEZFY", "B001G5T6H6", "B000HRMCTI", "B0007TS24U", "B0009K7RT8", "B00096S49O", "B000EJ9VDY", "B000KF0GSQ", "B000OVLBFI", "B000AM8RQM", "B000SH3XCM", "B00000G02A", "B001F76PDI", "B000ELL1P8", "B000A6QMQA", "B002EQFXZA", "B000L2125O", "B0009Z3LGQ", "B000ASBKHE", "B0009NSDCK", "B000FIS7HK", "B0007TFLLM", "B0012IWO08", "B002SD94AY", "B003L51GW2", "B0007V46JI", "B000ASDFGS", "B000IFRT5G", "B0008JFMEW", "B000GPVUMG", "B000AQ6904", "B002BSC57U", "B0009VCSXW", "B0008JFMF6", "B000R3BN4M", "B007M6W36Y", "B000BYRCHE", "B0009RCPV6", "B000E1YW04", "B002I0GZBI", "B0009X7BFA", "B000B5IP6U", "B0009KQOME", "B000A0GP5Y", "B000ENUYFE", "B0050JN84Q", "B000BGZRTC", "B003DS4Z6Q", "B001KMRN0M", "B000G8O0MU", "B000EWBKU8", "B0047ERZ7Q", "B000KKRD2S", "B00168PFFK", "B00311G2DY", "B00083G5CG", "B002BS47WG", "B0007Z2556", "B0009FU10U", "B000B8IA4E", "B0045SE9XC", "B000AAJTM0", "B0019C6KAC", "B000F2DE8S", "B0011VPYIK", "B0009350CQ", "B0009NJFPY", "B000ADWD2A", "B000FYZS6M", "B000VIUNZI", "B000AQ690Y", "B0009WPZPY", "B003ALEWKU", "B000F4PDEO", "B000A7Q1XI", "B000803BQM", "B0009K7RTI", "B000MNP2KS", "B000NIBUQW", "B000BKJ76C", "B0013KPSDA", "B007ZH9OFI", "B000059TMB", "B002TPTDFC", "B000A3XYE6", "B00151QYU8", "B000F5GJO6", "B0009VRHME", "B0009W5JAA", "B0009RCPXE", "B000BW7QV8", "B0009NSE42", "B001IZNIVE", "B000BYRCRO", "B000B5IOVQ", "B000B5IOW0", "B00083FZH2"], "bought_together": ["B000WZEZFY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001G5T6GW", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00B65JMEI", "B00AEFXJS6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 199481}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.5, "brand": "Son", "asin": "B000J3OTO6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MwbfwtGuL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Talladega Nights - The Ballad of Ricky Bobby [UMD for PSP]"}

{"description": "Twenty years' worth of country superstar Reba McEntire's engaging music videos are included onReba: Video Gold 1. The first thing that stands out is their consistent production quality. There isn't a single video from, say, the 1980s--an era that left a lot of artists with embarrassing promotional artifacts--in this collection, beginning with the 1986 \"Whoever&#x92;s In New England,\" which casts McEntire as a stay-at-home wife whose busy husband may be cheating on her during business trips. \"Sunday Kind of Love\" takes a very different approach, setting its pop ballad in a World War II ballroom while, elsewhere, a wounded husband returns home from the war. Another unexpected setting accompanies McEntire&#x92;s cover of Don Everly&#x92;s \"Cathy&#x92;s Clown,\" in which the song&#x92;s hard questions about a jilted man are transferred to the Wild West. \"Fancy\" is the biggest clich&#xE9; in this anthology, in which Reba plays a big star returning to her rustic roots, while \"Is There Life Out There\" finds her portraying a beleaguered waitress trying to go to school and be a devoted wife and mother all at once. (Huey Lewis plays her spouse.)\"Does He Love You,\" a duet with Linda Davis, is a fairly tortured story of a man in love with both of the women singing the song. It feels silly, but the whole thing is ultimately played for a laugh. (Rob Reiner, of all people, makes a little cameo appearance.) \"Why Haven't I Heard from You\" is the most fun video here, a sassy musical set in a Grecian beauty parlor; McEntire&#x92;s appealing but comically rubber face proves a lot of fun. \"If You See Him/If You See Her,\" a duet with Brooks and Dunn, is a very satisfying performance with a little story that finds Kix Brooks playing a mutual friend to both ex-lovers Ronnie Dunn and McEntire. Things take a sentimental turn toward the end with McEntire&#x92;s cover of Kenny Rogers' \"Sweet Music Man,\" as well as \"What Do You Say\" (a maudlin story of a mom dying of cancer) and \"He Gets That from Me\" (the story of a mother and son getting by after the death of the family patriarch).--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000JCEU4G", "B0031XYLP8", "B00005R872", "B00061QJ26", "B004K7M72S", "B00005UM1T", "B000HEWH4Q", "B0041U7RF6", "B00005NP1D", "B00CDXG4UC", "B001G9LVKW", "B0015RRNIY", "0553572385", "B0000TB03W", "B000NY1ECG", "B00D3UOE7O", "B003LXBTF8", "B000002PG9", "B0006SSQD4", "B000FIHNHK", "055338094X", "B000002OPT", "B0011ETNTI", "B0000TB08M", "B007FGXVCG", "B000T0C0MC", "B0027CSMYA", "B00I4F0IWI", "B000K8O27O", "B000021Y7Q", "B003XMKMZU", "B0007QS3TM", "B0000C8AQS", "B0000C0FH2", "B00008977O", "B000VT6ND8", "6303585388", "B0000C0FGY", "B00005O6OH", "B00009V7PJ", "B001GJ4U9G", "B00FEPW7OI", "B000BISBDO", "B000VI711W", "B000B9EYJS", "B00000DBTJ", "B00008AOXD", "B00016XO3S", "B00001O33W", "B001CIOCRG", "B0001Z3632", "B0000CEB60", "B0007XG32Y", "B002EZLQ0C", "B00452J596", "B009RWVLN2", "B000H7JCIW", "B004AGDJIA", "B00EIEPHBG", "B0000640TH", "B0000A02WW", "B000002PDV", "B000006L5N", "B00018WNOW", "B000A3Z9B2", "B001FSKE84", "B0028S110U", "B004O8OLNG", "B000KN7BRM", "B00DSKSZXI", "B0028S1114", "B000A6T2DK", "B000002OI1", "B00001O2GT", "B000B19EAK", "B00006FMBZ", "B0000E1WNW", "B000HT3PEM", "B009KKLQKO", "B0000SYAB2", "B00IJLHZPA", "B0016GLYKW", "B000B8384G", "B003L77G56", "B003F3NE7K", "B001VPJYZU", "B00005YUOC", "1573306983", "B000FUTUYC", "B001K2KMFA", "B000E6ESBW", "B000640WGM", "B006X08ET0", "B0000TGADW", "B000053GTF", "6302142342", "0553096079", "B0006SSQ2U", "B00004ST9Q", "B00IIT0CHG"], "bought_together": ["B000JCEU4G", "B0031XYLP8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001G9LVKW", "B0031XYLP8", "B00005QGB7", "B000BISBDO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 145161}, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Country", "Today's Country"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Vocal Pop"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 12.99, "brand": "Umgd/Mca Nashville", "asin": "B000JCEU46", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51kjBU1hp6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Reba McEntire: Video Gold, Vol. I"}

{"description": "Pile together a blue-ribbon cast, a screenplay high in quirkiness, and the Sundance stamp of approval, and youve got yourself a crossover indie hit. That formula worked for Little Miss Sunshine, a frequently hilarious study of family dysfunction. Meet the Hoovers, an Albuquerque clan riddled with depression, hostility, and the tattered remnants of the American Dream; despite their flakiness, they manage to pile into a VW van for a weekend trek to L.A. in order to get moppet daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) into the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. Much of the pleasure of this journey comes from watching some skillful comic actors doing their thing: Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette as the parents (hes hoping to become a self-help authority), Alan Arkin as a grandfather all too willing to give uproariously inappropriate advice to a sullen teenage grandson (Paul Dano), and a subdued Steve Carell as a jilted gay professor on the verge of suicide. The film is a crowd-pleaser, and if anything is a little too eager to bend itself in the direction of quirk-loving Sundance audiences; it can feel forced. But the breezy momentum and the ingenious actors help push the material over any bumps in the road. -- Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000YABYLA", "B00005JMJG", "B001UV4XGU", "B00A81MV3U", "B00DL46ZN8", "B00005JNC2", "B0007TKOAA", "B001UV4XUG", "B00005ALS0", "B00118T632", "B00AEFXESQ", "B007L6VR12", "B008220BA2", "B003L20ICE", "B0000640VJ", "B008OHV49W", "B001P9KR8U", "B000A7DVR2", "B00000F5MN", "B007L6VRBM", "B00AFEY354", "B0001GOH6Q", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00337KM2S", "B000H0MKOC", "B004UXUX4Q", "B0034G4OZE", "B00011CZRE", "B00275EGWY", "0205751989", "B000FVQLQQ", "B0010X8NF0", "B004SIP95G", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B004QL7KKC", "B00079Z9VO", "B00003CXZ4", "B0021L8UOY", "B001MM3AZM", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00606P0BM", "B00005Q4CS", "B00ADRYCWC", "B001TOD92C", "B004SEUIW4", "B000P0J0EW", "B0015OKWKI", "B000CS464G", "B0007PLLBU", "B00009W5CA", "B00005JLSB", "B004A8ZWV0", "B007RKFXUS", "B0010AN7Z4", "B00012QLB4", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B003UESJH4", "B00005JNBQ", "B007VYE4PK", "B000WZEZGI", "B00AEBB9F0", "6304907729", "B003Y5H574", "B000SFOW8I", "B00005JMJ4", "B001BL96K2", "B00006FMUW", "B002VPTJOA", "B00003CXO1", "B000J103OI", "B0038N9WKU", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00008975Z", "B003ASLJQI", "B0049985XW", "B003ASLJO0", "B001J9KJ4I", "B001FZQOW2", "B00000G02H", "1557047707", "B000BYRCQU", "B00121QGPY", "B00005JL57", "B000021Y77", "B000A3XY5A", "B000MZHW40", "B0000AC8LR", "B00AEFY0KW", "B0045HCJ9E", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B00AEBB9FA", "B00005A06N", "B000ELJAEM", "B00AEFYAMA", "B00E8RKHWW", "B00005JLRE", "B005LAIHE0", "B000M341QE", "B0039UT3LK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00118T632", "B00DL46ZN8", "B0007UC8Y4", "B001AGXEAG"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 401537}, "asin": "B000JU9OJ4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51T7A7BDBWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Little Miss Sunshine [Region 2]"}
{"description": "Equal parts documentary, children's story, and narrative drama,Cave of the Yellow Dogis a beautifully filmed adventure that the entire family will enjoy. It's unique on many levels, the most notable being that the charismatic family portrayed in the film are an actual family, and none of them are professional actors. The eldest daughter (played by adorable Nansal Batchuluun) appears to be about 6 or 7 years old. Her life is nothing like that of an American first grader. She goes away to school, returning home during the summers. Nansal cares for younger sister and brother, telling them about how homes in big cities have toilets in the house. She collects dried dung for the family's fire pit and helps her mother cook. And when her father goes to town for a few days, it is Nansal who takes over his chore of leading a herd of sheep to graze in a fuller pasture miles from her home. Nansal is mature for her age, but she is still a child who can't resist cute animals. So when she finds a small black and white pup holed up in a cave, she adopts him and names him Zochor (the Mongolian equivalent of Spot). Her father--worried that the dog may have grown up feral with a pack of wolves--forbids her to keep the puppy and the viewer is never certain whether Nansal and Zochor will be able to remain together. What setsCave of the Yellow Dogapart from films such asLassieandOld Yelleris the breathtaking buttes, vistas, and scenery showcased in the film. Watching the apple-cheeked children squeal with laughter as they play in front of their yurt--their collapsible and movable home--viewers get the sense that they wouldn't choose any other life, even though theirs seems filled with hardship for those of us accustomed to the comforts of modern-day living. The Palme d'Or winner at the Cannes Film Festival, this movie is heartwarming and pragmatic at the same time.--Jae-Ha Kim", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006FFRB6", "B000065V3Z", "B00004VVO5", "B000MGBLVE", "B000GYI3J0", "B000F1IO02", "B001139ZIS", "B00116VG3M", "B001CDLAUS", "B001N6FPRI", "1844084566", "B00005QFE5", "B000P0J00Q", "B000ASDFYK", "B002VRNJT4", "B000AYELXI", "B0012Z361M", "B000KX0IPE", "B00346UX5E", "B004KDVMRS", "B002U4F5W2", "B002W1HBM0", "B00004TJKJ", "B0010S6ERY", "B008LFYZAM", "034911580X", "B002ZG974M", "B004DMIJ0E", "B00005JLD4", "B0000C2IW7", "B000PHX4FQ", "B00006HAXY", "B002ZTQVGQ", "B0007Z9QSA", "B001RXDM36", "B0025KW1O6", "B006LLY8LY", "1600601308", "B008B9JTFO", "B00005JLEU", "B0007M1244", "B002AJQ7HE"], "bought_together": ["B0006FFRB6", "B000065V3Z"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0006FFRB6", "B000065V3Z", "B00004VVO5", "B008LFYZAM"]}, "price": 15.78, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 43292}, "asin": "B000KHX70S", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EECz%2Br2BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Cave of the Yellow Dog"}

{"description": "From Lucy-tormented Hollywood A-listers and bongo-propelled production numbers to archival goodies such as long-lost footage, there is much to love in this collection of all 13 episodes fromThe Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show(also known asThe Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour). FollowingI Love Lucy'ssixth and final season, these monthly (give or take) specials reunited America with Ricky and Lucy (and Keith Thibodeaux's adorable Little Ricky, still living the country life in Connecticut. The expanded, hour-long format allowed for celebrity guest stars and excursions to far-flung locales, such as Japan and Mexico. Not matter where they go, Lucy can always be counted on to act, in Desi's words, \"a little crazy in the head,\" which is how she winds up masquerading as Ernie Kovacs' chauffeur in \"Lucy Meets the Moustache\" (an episode making its home-video debut), dangling Milton Berle from a construction crane in \"Milton Berle Hides Out at the Ricardos,\" or sparking a uranium uproar in Las Vegas in \"Lucy Hunts Uranium.\"A highlight of this set is the first-ever home video release of the uncut version of \"Lucy Takes a Cruise to Havana,\" a flashback episode in which Lucy meets Ricky on a \"maiden voyage\" to Cuba. She also meets future best friend Ethel (Vivian Vance) and her new husband Fred (a toupeed William Frawley), and goes overboard for her first celebrity sighting, Rudy Vallee. Because these episodes do not play as often in syndication, they seem fresher than their endlessly re-run counterparts. They are full of delights for movie, TV, andLucybuffs, among them, Fred MacMurray getting \"Uranium\" fever, Maurice Chevalier singing \"Yankee Doodle Boy\" in the \"Mexico\" episode, prolific character actor Sid Melton as a bellboy in the \"Alaska\" episode, and a va-voom Vance decked out as maid and a dance hall girl, respectively, in the \"The Celebrity Next Door\" and \"Milton Berle\" episodes. Among this set's prodigious bonus features include 1951 color footage that an audience member surreptitiously filmed, rediscovered scenes that were cut from the original broadcasts, and a filmed presentation to Westinghouse, which sponsored the series.

The film is a parable, combining the realities of Russian everyday life with monastic ritual and routine.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002KQOH6", "B00280QNK6", "B000K2UEDG", "B000RTCSIQ", "B0000DGKI7", "0984284834", "6305257450", "B00006LPEK", "B00019G4TQ", "B000Z27H7M", "1887904190", "B000LV6OHQ", "B004XVMCLC", "B003CT351M", "0830840451", "B001QOZYRS", "0809123304", "B0000633SD", "B004O63TQI", "0486262448", "B004Y2SDX6", "B004XML3KC", "B001PCNZEU", "B0019T0JAW", "0881414913", "B0000714AX", "B003VWR1XI", "B008MZTKFG", "B00003CXF4", "0879079592", "1936270897", "0881411957", "B000LV6OJE", "0809115093", "0385468148", "0913836133", "B002LC8LEC", "B000NQRDZG", "0385500920", "0913836087", "B00006JO77", "B000EANSXM", "0718003594", "B0001Q23SK", "048648873X", "B0022RVO18", "0913836044", "0571191657", "B0000BWVCR", "B004GNBBVO", "0140146563", "B0002H73EM", "B000HEWENA", "0872430545", "0981731767", "B0002KM5RE", "0881410497", "B00004WL3I", "0872431738", "0674730836", "B0001LJCAW", "1936270137", "9728552343", "B000VAQY2W", "B002W1HBM0", "B006IW8E3Y", "0884650596", "B004LWZVWU", "1595553711", "0881411566", "1590302788", "B0000ALPJ2", "9606890244", "088141039X", "0571130135", "B00006IUJ1", "0913836583", "B000065V3Z", "B00019G4T6", "0892831243", "B000I8OOHE", "1887904077", "0881411809", "B000EBFLIG", "B0018LX9RG", "B001UE49BQ", "0486455971", "1887904220", "B0000714AW", "0231099312", "B006ML50YC", "9607201191", "0140444750"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000RTCSIQ", "B00280QNK6", "B000K2UEDG", "B0002KQOH6"]}, "price": 15.18, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 41567}, "asin": "B000LTTOOS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51y2ZfHiZqL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ostrov (The Island), NTSC version with English subtitles"}
{"description": "Dr. Andrew \"Andy\" Brown (Treat Williams - \"Hair,\" \"Prince of the City\") led a comfortable existence in New York City with his family and a lucrative practice as a world-renowned neurosurgeon - until fate took his loving spouse from him and changed his life forever. After his wife's death, Dr. Brown moved his young daughter and wayward teenage son to a small, out-of-the-way burg nestled deep in the Colorado mountains. It's where old-fashioned healing counts more than surgical statistics...where folks are just as quirky as they please...where a grieving heart can breathe free and mend itself. And it's the place where Dr. Brown can become the kind of doctor - and father - his wife would have wanted him to be.

{"description": "Martin Scorsese makes a welcome return to the mean streets (of Boston, in this case) withThe Departed, hailed by many as Scorsese's best film sinceCasino. Since this crackling crime thriller is essentially a Scorsese-stamped remake of the acclaimed 2002 Hong Kong thrillerInfernal Affairs, the film was intensely scrutinized by devoted critics and cinephiles, and while Scorsese's intense filmmaking and all-star cast deserve ample acclaim,The Departedis also worthy of serious re-assessment, especially with regard to what some attentive viewers described as sloppy craftsmanship (!), notably in terms of mismatched shots and jagged continuity. But no matter where you fall on the Scorsese appreciation scale, there's no denying thatThe Departedis a signature piece of work from one of America's finest directors, designed for maximum impact with a breathtaking series of twists, turns, and violent surprises. It's an intricate cat-and-mouse game, but this time the cat and mouse are both moles: Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is an ambitious cop on the rise, planted in the Boston police force by criminal kingpin Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a hot-tempered police cadet who's been artificially disgraced and then planted into Costello's crime operation as a seemingly trustworthy soldier. As the multilayered plot unfolds (courtesy of a scorching adaptation byKingdom of Heavenscreenwriter William Monahan), Costigan and Sullivan conduct a volatile search for each other (they're essentially looking for \"themselves\") while simultaneously wooing the psychiatrist (Vera Farmiga) assigned to treat their crime-driven anxieties.Such convenient coincidences might sink a lesser film, butThe Departedis so electrifying that you barely notice the plot-holes. And while Nicholson's profane swagger is too much \"Jack\" and not enough \"Costello,\" he's still a joy to watch, especially in a film that's additionally energized by memorable (and frequently hilarious) supporting roles for Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg, and a host of other big-name performers.The Departedalso makes clever and plot-dependent use of cell-phones, to the extent that it couldn't exist without them. Powered by Scorsese's trademark use of well-chosen soundtrack songs (from vintage rock to Puccini's operas),The Departedmay not be perfect, but it's one helluva ride for moviegoers, proving popular enough to become the biggest box-office hit of Scorsese's commercially rocky career.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002ZG99N6", "B000P0J09M", "B004SIP7TE", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002ZG980U", "B002VWNIEA", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEBB8NI", "B002T9H2LA", "B00005JLSB", "B000MZHW40", "B00080ZG10", "B003ASLJQS", "B000P0J0AG", "B000P0J0EW", "B000C20VPA", "B003UESJHO", "B004SIP7ZS", "B003ASLJO0", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AHTYI5M", "B00275EGWY", "B000XR9L50", "B000A3XY5A", "B0007DFJ0G", "B001N44BVQ", "B00003CXWV", "B008MILL8W", "B000286RP2", "B004SIP7VM", "B00005V9HH", "6305313687", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004FQX5B6", "B00AEFXKUI", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEBB86A", "B005LAIIJY", "B0016Q2D66", "B003ASLJQI", "B00008975Z", "B000IY04Q8", "B001P9KR8U", "B00005JNJV", "B000C20VRS", "B008R65XYC", "B005LAIGRS", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00008DP4C", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00005JN0W", "B005LAIGLE", "B000A2UBN4", "B002QEHPQU", "B000P0J0EM", "B003UESJH4", "B007D5E7C2", "6304765258", "B000P0J0D8", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00004WG2F", "0767830555", "B000LC55F2", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B004EPYZP8", "B000A7DVR2", "B00005JPD0", "B000WZEZGI", "B00049QQHI", "B000FS9FCG", "B00004XPPB", "B006OFN0SE", "B009AMAL4Y", "B004U7MR14", "B000GFLKF8", "B003AWRMCE", "B0019L770A", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B0000AM6JI", "B004SIP9Z6", "B001GZ6QC4", "0783240295", "B0010DR4BO", "B000065U1N", "B00001ZWUS", "B00BB67UNW", "B0000B1OFL", "B00AEBB9K0", "B00DHDDE32", "B00005JKWX", "B0051MKNV8", "B002ZG97RE", "0767802519", "B0034G4P94", "B00DHHWXYY", "B00005B6JZ", "B00003CXZ4", "B001TODCII"], "bought_together": ["B000P0J09M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000RETOHY", "B000P0J09M", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEBB8NI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5067}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.5, "brand": "Warner Bros", "asin": "B000M341QE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RZnzpL34L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}
