{"description": "There are no Vikings inThe Viking Queen, a low-budget adventure from Hammer studios set in the British Isles during the Roman reign of Nero. Salina (Carita), the curiously Italian-accented daughter of a dying British king, inherits his kingdom on the eve of a treaty that splits power between the native monarchy and the Roman government. American star Don Murray (ofBus StopandThe Hoodlum Priestfame), looking oddly uncomfortable in a Roman tunic, is the fair-minded Roman governor-general Justinian, whose jurisprudence and willingness to compromise infuriates his bloodthirsty second in command. Plots from within both camps threaten not just the uneasy peace between the Britons and the Romans but the hot-and-heavy love affair between Salina and Justinian (whose flirtatious chariot race leads to a little riverside nooky). This sword-and-sandal-meets-bearskin-and-clubs adventure is at its best on location in the British countryside, where the grand scenery belies its meager budget, but the battle scenes suffer from a tiny cast of soldiers and lackluster choreography. There are plenty of scantily clad maidens (who knew the ancient British climate was so temperate?), Druid ceremonies with human sacrifices, and even a kinky flogging, but ultimately director Don Chaffey's attempts to inject Hammer's lurid edge into the drama come off as both perfunctory and forced. Though often entertaining, this period adventure never reaches the smart, sexy, and showy gothic splendor of Hammer's horror classics.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 433857}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "0764005448", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514D141D5BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Viking Queen [VHS]"}

The legend of the Candyman is a potent one around the high-rise tenements of Chicago's Cabrini-Green housing complex, where the residents speak of a dark, ominous figure who appears when his victims say his name five times in front of a mirror, then mercilessly slashes them to death. Upon learning that the Candyman is rumored to live in one of the vacant tenements, a University of Illinois researcher (Virginia Madsen) investigates a recent murder at Cabrini-Green. She learns that the Candyman (played by Tony Todd) is both unreal and chillingly real--a supernatural force of evil empowered by those who believe in his legend. He is a killer made flesh by the belief of others, and the young researcher's investigation is a threat to his existence. What happens next? We wouldn't dare spoil the chills, but rest assured that writer-director Rose has tapped into a wellspring of urban angst and fear, andCandymanserves up its gruesome frights with a refreshing dose of intelligence.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005K3NZ", "6305622760", "B001B8XRT6", "B000MNOX8U", "B008874968", "B000A6T1ZY", "B004AC6PMG", "B001B1UO6W", "B00005NRN6", "B000GBEWRU", "B000V4UFZK", "B0000AOX0D", "B000I2J68M", "6305972001", "B001B1872A", "B0000AOX0E", "B00006FDCD", "B000FS9FE4", "B001DJLD1W", "B005CFBZQ6", "B000099T3M", "B000RIWAVW", "B005OT810I", "B000MV8ABS", "B000EHRVP6", "B00006IUFV", "B0000AOX0A", "B001NPD9LS", "B000IMUYJM", "B001DJLD0S", "1573628174", "B0052XU4BK", "B003UGLCIA", "B00079Z9WI", "B000PMLJMQ", "B00009PY4G", "B000A2X3U2", "B0053TWVDC", "B002HML6YI", "B00005YUNE", "B00006FDBT", "B000VKL6Z2", "B000MV8AC2", "B001AGNMFI", "B00AEFYV9W", "B00018D42W", "B0013D8LAE", "B0002IQLH6", "B002LMSWN2", "B00005UQ9W", "B000S0GYRU", "B004EI2NP4", "B00AEFYYH6", "B000WC3864", "B0000CEB6Y", "B000FWHW86", "B0053TWVIM", "B006ZL1P66", "B00AEFY2LO", "B000N4RAQU", "B000TSIJWY", "B008CYDD7I", "B000FA57UI", "B0056P6SOG", "B002JT69IW", "B00CERJI5U", "B002ZG971U", "B0001EFV7M", "B002OVO18A", "0767817664", "B00006AUIG", "B005CFBZVG", "B00005NKSC", "B0000D9PNG", "B00005RHGK", "0792839706", "B00005LC4Q", "B004P7CM9Q", "B00JF5GAIW", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B002I41KNC", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B00001QGUM", "B0024FADD8", "B00DTPRZ24", "B001JV5BIA", "B003PIUINI", "B002VWNIDG", "B0021L8UPS", "B004LWZW24", "B003PIUINS", "B000Q66Q2O", "B00005K3NR", "0783230451", "B0006SGYL0", "B00023P4SS", "B0002VYOVS", "B0087ZG7UW", "B005CFBYW6", "B00006FI0R"], "bought_together": ["B00005K3NZ", "6305622760"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001B8XRT6", "6305972001", "B00004TDTO", "B001B1UO6W"]}, "price": 17.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 183485}, "asin": "0767817656", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DGRV60NAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Candyman"}
{"description": "That's right, they didn't stop making Gozilla films in the mid-'70s like you thought, but resurrected the rubberized reptile in the mid-'80s and have continued making crazy, clear-your-Saturday-afternoon-schedule offerings to this very day.  And here in this double-feature disc are two of the craziest from the early '90s.Godzilla vs. King Ghidorainvolves some western folks in a flying saucer from the future who come back to warn Japan of its imminent demise by Godzilla.  But their real aim is to aid in that destruction, thus keeping Japan from becoming an economic powerhouse.  Along the way, some cute little creatures they've brought with them are transformed into King Ghidora, the not-so-cute nemesis of Godzilla, and the two inevitably battle it out as unwitting champions of their  times. The special effects are tops, the action is silly and pulpish, and the plot is lifted partially fromGodzilla vs. Monster Zero(1968). If you don't watch this film with a silly grin on your face, you just aren't a Godzilla fan.Godzilla and Mothra: The Battle for Earthis a variation on one of the best of the old Godzilla films,Godzilla vs. The Thing(1964).  When a meteorite hits the Earth, Godzilla is awakened, along with Mothra and his evil twin Battra, the Black Mothra!  Mothra must save the Earth from these scourges, with the help of its minions, the Cosmos, those twin miniature girls who sing the eerily beautiful Mothra theme from the earlier film.  And the special effects are even more impressive and hallucinatory than before, if that's possible.The pleasure of seeing these rarities on DVD is only slightly hampered by their truncated aspect ratios; yes, Mothra's widescreen wings have been clipped down to paltry pan and scan, and thus denuded of its native Tohoscope.--Jim Gay", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003L9CB", "B0006SGYLK", "B0000VAGXU", "B00066KWCY", "B0001AVZ9Y", "B0000VAGXK", "B009ERJY6G", "B00003CXLS", "B0088FS1DC", "B00I462X7K", "B000P24FAE", "B000BMY2L0", "B00I462Y60", "B00I462XF2", "B000OCY7IU", "B000OCY7IK", "B000MV8AJK", "B00003L9CE", "B00125WAYQ", "B00125WAYG", "B00JB08O76", "B000MV8AJU", "B000VXWK86", "B001AR0D40", "B007WETMRY", "B000E1BXFG", "B00I099JO6", "B0024FAG2G", "B0088FS27C", "0767817478", "B002HTCOCO", "B0051WTODQ", "B005ENCIWG", "B00I099JZK", "B000FA4TLQ", "B00IE41A9O", "B00KMO1210", "B0002V7OE2", "B002DQSKLU", "B004G5SOYO", "B003NHMYJM", "B00I3C1T6G", "B007I1TFNM", "B003NHMYJC", "B00066KWCO", "B00IQAUO48", "B000EXZKR6", "B003CNQPMO", "B00006FD9I", "B00I462XGG", "B00006IUGR", "B00C0VTLOS", "B00HFWETZ8", "161377933X", "B009ERK122", "B008L0YMSW", "B0039YOK8W", "B00K2CHVSK", "B00D3Y18WO", "1401250351", "B0009V9I5I", "B007QR95QU", "B00EL3W53M", "B0093QC3SY", "B0035CVB30", "B00I462XLG", "B00I462XNO", "B005VU9LO0", "B0001DMV6M", "B00JMNAYXY", "B007ZRTID6", "B001M2W0D0", "B004GGU9M8", "B00IQAUO6Q", "B006D53Q2U", "1613772238", "B007DFNFTI", "B00310PSTY", "B00IAO618S", "B008R7BVTM", "1608873447", "B000EXZKRG", "B000098ZSK", "1613777493", "B00IQAUO2A", "B00EVEMMRU", "B000R1A0L6", "B0040HYLF4", "B00HMYUYJ4", "B00ILCZEG4", "B00024W1TC", "B000FDFSYU", "B00DEU5DZ0", "1613775954", "B00J40DU54", "B000OX2CUY", "1403964742", "B005SL8XYG", "B00K2CHW48"], "bought_together": ["B00003L9CB"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000VXWK86", "B00003L9CB", "B00I462Y60", "B00I462X7K"]}, "price": 13.08, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 35983}, "asin": "0767825489", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/612ARAJREQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah / Godzilla &amp; Mothra: The Battle for Earth"}

{"description": "Something of a remake ofCitizen Kane, Orson Welles's 1955Mr.&nbsp;Arkadinis a knowing and self-reflective variation on one of Welles's pet themes: the search for a  defining secret of a powerful man. Welles plays an important financier who tries to discover his own past by hiring a man  (Robert Arden) to research it. Did the seemingly haunted Arkadin  simply forget who he is or where he's been? Or is he seeking his own Rosebud--a crucial,  lost thing from his life that can serve (if identified) as a mythic key to former happiness?  The film, a European coproduction, was made under the typically difficult and extended  conditions Welles had to navigate after leaving Hollywood, and the bumpiness shows. But  the entire project is really an act of Wellesian deconstruction--it's Welles making a film  about the kind of film Orson Welles previously made--and that approach is more  electrifying than one might imagine. The editing in this film, for instance, is not quite like in any of Welles's other works, with bursts of linear action literally disappearing between  frames, as if the fabric of reality itself was vanishing. As far as the titan Arkadin is  concerned, it might as well be.--Tom Keogh", "price": 39.86, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 706907}, "asin": "0780020634", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5113QG7W01L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Confidential Report (AKA Mr. Arkadin) [VHS]"}

{"description": "Written by Carl Foreman (who was later blacklisted during the anticommunist hearings of the '50s) and superbly directed by Fred Zinnemann, this 1952 classic stars Gary Cooper as just-married lawman Will Kane, who is about to retire as a small-town sheriff and begin a new life with his bride (Grace Kelly) when he learns that gunslinger Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) is due to arrive at high noon to settle an old score. Kane seeks assistance from deputies and townsfolk, but soon realizes he'll have to stand alone in his showdown with Miller and his henchmen. Innovative for its time, the suspenseful story unfolds in approximate real time (from 10:40 a.m. to high noon in an 84-minute film), and many interpreted Foreman's drama as an allegorical reflection of apathy and passive acceptance of Senator Joseph McCarthy's anticommunist campaign. Political underpinnings aside, this remains a milestone of its genre (often referred to as the first &quot;adult&quot; Western), and Cooper is flawless in his Oscar-winning role.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792107683", "0792106989", "630150528X", "6301977297", "6304457316", "0783221347", "6300267938", "B000006N70", "0792837371", "B001KO1BCQ", "6300184951", "0783222955", "B003MG6FJY", "630197705X", "0792110188", "079284517X", "6300215741", "B00AEFYTEY", "6300181340", "6300268470", "B000MGTQ7K", "0783235607", "6301971558", "B0049985XW", "1558807780", "6302640504", "6300183513", "6303686796", "630442972X", "6301973410", "B0013D8L8Q", "6303402070", "B000XR9L50", "0800132009", "6300273210", "B000M7BEPQ", "B000059TFW", "0790743159", "B005AMJ31U", "B0035JHYJI", "0790743213", "6301978536", "630021639X", "0800113055", "6303057225", "6302360978", "6304359721", "B00003OSTO", "6300215644", "0790743531", "6300216500", "6301802330", "B00004RFFA", "6300216195", "630018224X", "0792110269", "079284520X", "6304039522", "0783235593", "0790758474", "6301599896", "6300215660", "6302484421", "1558804226", "6304429711", "6301973259", "6300183211", "0783236352", "B00005QATY", "6304071876", "6301797957", "0800104803", "6303072747", "6304359705", "0800100832", "6303953425", "6300181421", "630248443X", "6303027016", "6301734734", "0792837096", "6300267970", "0792107128", "6300213838", "6300216012", "6300216233", "6302484405", "0792102320", "6301586026", "0792838556", "6300183580", "6302054982", "0784011923", "6304039530", "630396155X", "B000GX7MMA", "6301969294", "6302484448", "B000005PPB"], "bought_together": ["0792107683", "0792106989"], "also_viewed": ["0800116917"]}, "price": 9.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 244368}, "asin": "0782008348", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4118FFB44JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "High Noon [VHS]"}
{"description": "There's a reason why Cindy Crawford was dubbed \"Baby Gia\" when she first hit the modeling scene. Indeed, Crawford, now the world's best-known supermodel, greatly resembled model Gia Carangi, who went from high school to the cover of BritishVoguein less than two years. Carangi appeared on many more covers ofVogue(French, British, Italian, and American) andCosmopolitanbefore dying of complications from AIDS (she was an IV heroin user) in 1986. Now most people recognize Carangi's name from this powerful HBO film that stars Golden Globe-winner Angelina Jolie, who comes by her talent honestly. Jolie is the daughter of veteran actor Jon Voight, and her own training as a model serves her well--she has the moves. Throughout, she's heartbreaking--as no doubt the real Carangi was--effective, and stunning.With good source material (Stephen Fried'sA Thing of Beauty: The Tragedy of Supermodel Gia), Jolie's stunning performance, and strong directing by Michael Cristofer, the movie goes beyond the merely sensational. The script was cowritten by Cristofer and novelist Jay McInerney, whoseBright Lights, Big Citycovers similar territory. As a cautionary tale,Giaworks. But to watch Jolie in her character's tragic self-destruction is utterly compelling.--N.F.

{"description": "Dorothy Dandridge was a Hollywood trailblazer. A confident sex symbol in the 1950s, she was the first black woman ever nominated for a Best Actress Oscar, but the electrifying stage chanteuse and dancer was forbidden to even enter the nightclubs and show rooms she performed in except from the stage. As portrayed by Halle Berry, who shepherded Dandridge's story to the screen, Dandridge is a sure, insistent star who battled racist studios and Jim Crow laws to maintain her dignity in public while stumbling through a private life marked by bad relationships and abusive lovers. Berry gives her best performance to date, brimming with ambition and moxie offstage, charming audiences with the slinky, sure moves of a nightclub veteran onstage, and convincingly \"becoming\" Dandridge in dramatic re-creations fromCarmen JonesandPorgy and Bess. Brent Spiner (Star Trek: The Next Generation) is sweet and sympathetic as her supportive, lovesick manager, and Klaus Maria Brandauer is, in Dandridge's words, a \"big old bulldog\" as director Otto Preminger. Director Martha Coolidge balances private troubles with professional milestones and setbacks and pulls no punches showing the institutional racism of late 1950s Las Vegas or the brutality of a vicious alcoholic husband. Originally made for HBO, this drama lacks the big-budget spectacle of traditional Hollywood biographies but offers in its place sharp writing, intelligent direction, and strong, sensitive performances.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005AQML", "B00AEFYG3S", "B000667HHW", "B0009S4IGA", "B00007L4KF", "B000Y11B8K", "B000B5XOSY", "B00465I192", "B004FK5EDY", "6305428409", "B000AJJNMM", "B0068FZ0W4", "B00465I1CE", "B000JLTRH2", "0790739313", "B00007AJG2", "B0006IIOHC", "B000BOH8X2", "B001P3SA94", "B000XA5JWG", "B0000560W6", "B00005RDAN", "B00066FAQW", "B000BOH922", "B003BV8I3Q", "B00441GZ1Y", "B000P0J092", "B000RO9Q7W", "B00005YU1M", "B00066FAVW", "B00EJU9GQ6", "B00DW5IL2E", "B00L6AW67I", "B00006LPHJ", "B000JJSL1W", "B000BNTMAA", "B00AEFY6TW", "B0000TWMTS", "B00066FAC6", "6306496238", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00BYS0RQE", "B000P0J0CE", "B00066FAOE", "B003Y5H4ZC", "B0041QSZS8", "B0000714BT", "B00007AJG1", "B0007LPS7W", "B00AEFXTKO", "B0000WN0NW", "B00005JND5", "B000BOH91S", "6305505780", "B000051YMS", "B0016LFG4M", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B002CWKU36", "B00GOZ2LPM", "B003VEL8ZS", "0792838076", "B0079ZWUCA", "B000GW8RYI", "B000069I0E", "6305428336", "B000035P5I", "B00114XTHA", "B000R17RQM", "B00000JGHV", "B001K98MGE", "B004YCKJGU", "B000WMA73G", "B004MCGNS0", "B000TLOMPE", "B00000J2KE", "B0058KGHX6", "B000BITV9W", "1558908390", "B0000399WJ", "B000C03O8S", "B005CGI4O6", "B002CA68NO", "B00803PG44", "B00H47IX5G", "0060956755", "B00319ECI8", "B00CDWQNZ4", "B00AEFYNG8", "B0088RMEII", "B00067BCBI", "B004LLIRR2", "B00005U156", "B00004Y2R1", "B000784XBW", "0783230524", "B003JLL2QS", "B000BBOUHM", "B00125WAWS", "B00005ASOO", "B00GO4RGWQ"], "bought_together": ["B00005AQML", "B00AEFYG3S"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFYG3S", "B0009S4IGA", "B000Y11B8K", "B00007L4KF"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 152293}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 10.18, "brand": "HBO HOME VIDEO", "asin": "0783116748", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51thCNFe5gL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Introducing Dorothy Dandridge"}

{"description": "Somebody in Hollywood thought there was some fish-out-of-water potential in this teaming of wild man Woody Harrelson and slow-burning Kiefer Sutherland as a pair of New Mexico cowboys who go to New York to tame the wild, wild, uh ... East. Well, they were mistaken, because this 1994 action-comedy is little more than a tiresome reworking ofCrocodile Dundee. Woody and Kiefer head for the Big Apple to rescue the illegal-immigrant daughter of one of their rodeo buddies (who has mysteriously disappeared), and what they discover is a sweatshop operation run by a hot-tempered thug (Dylan McDermott, before his role on TV'sThe Practice). That's when the boys start using their ropin' and shootin' skills to foil the bad guys. One measure of this film's credibility is the inevitable scene of the boys riding on horseback through the gridlocked streets of Manhattan. Uh huh.  You know how it goes... you just have to go with it or marvel at the sheer stupidity of it all. Of course, forget all the sniping if you're a fan of Harrelson or Sutherland--they're both doing their best under the burden of disadvantage.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00002SSKG"], "bought_together": ["B00002SSKG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 292354}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0783211694", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5156DGQ5TPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cowboy Way [VHS]"}

Her feisty character not only gets to sing more jazzy songs (including the toe-tapping \"The Turntable Song,\" the sassy \"You Wanna Keep Your Baby Lookin' Right\" and the breezy \"Something in the Wind\") as well as opera (a powerful rendition of \"Il Miserere\" with Jan Peerce). With the always lovable Donald O'Connor (whose frenzied \"I Love a Mystery\" number is an obvious pre-cursor to his \"Make 'Em Laugh\" routine in the classic \"Singin' in the Rain\"), \"Something in the Wind\" turns out to be one of Deanna Durbin's best!", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304296983", "0783229690", "6303929958", "6303328172", "0783229704", "6304296991", "630212056X", "0783229712", "0783224443", "0783224451", "6304296975"], "bought_together": ["6304296983"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 467173}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0783224435", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F7MBJ82TL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Something in the Wind [VHS]"}

An ambitious, epic, utterly mind-boggling--and, let's admit it, all-out weird--adaptation of Frank Herbert's classic science fiction novel,Duneremains one of the most controversial films in the director's exceedingly provocative career. The story (ifDunecan be said to have just one story) is complex and convoluted in the epic tradition; it has something to do with political intrigue and a planet that is home to a precious spice and gigantic sand worms. Think Shakespeare'sHenry IVwith a dash ofTremors, and set in another galaxy. But despite plenty of strangely whispered voice-overs that explain the characters' thoughts (and endlessly detailed exposition), storytelling is not really among the film's strong points. There are, however, a lot of memorably fantastic/grotesque images, an extraordinary cast, and a soundtrack featuring Toto. I told you it was weird.

Anthony Perkins is unforgettable as Norman Bates, the mama's boy proprietor of the Bates Motel; and so is Janet Leigh as Marion Crane, who makes an impulsive decision and becomes a fugitive from the law, hiding out at Norman's roadside inn for one fateful night.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000Q66Q8I", "B0087ZG7PW", "B00000IQVC", "B00871C09S", "B0087ZG7R0", "B0009X76P0", "B0045HCJ9E", "B002VWNIDG", "B00004TS0G", "B0002HOERG", "1590203356", "B00003CXCF", "B000RIWAVW", "B00DNUSFZQ", "B003UGLCIA", "B0009X76PK", "B008BFSMBA", "B0002HOEQ2", "B0050FXDDQ", "B000V4UFZK", "B000FS9FE4", "B000ECX0O2", "B00AEBB97S", "B004FQX5B6", "B000CCW2U2", "B00009PY4G", "B007STBUHI", "B00005K3NR", "B0009NZ2MO", "B00I9KW95M", "B002VWNIAY", "B000CCW2TS", "B00ARA4SLU", "B000LP6KNU", "B001D2WU9I", "078323502X", "B000A9QK7I", "B00FERST4S", "B0010YVCI4", "B00079Z9WI", "B00AEFYYH6", "B006FE83UE", "B00003CXBU", "B00018D42W", "B000TSIJWY", "B0087ZG7OI", "B007Y1NR1W", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B0009A40ES", "B00AEBB89C", "B007Y1NNAW", "B001NPD9LS", "1593765118", "B002ZG971U", "B000CCW2UW", "B004LWZW2O", "B000ECX0Q0", "B00A1AU72A", "B00009NHC5", "B001D8W7EU", "B00006ADD5", "0767830555", "B0053TWVDC", "B000VKL6Z2", "B006TTC5WC", "B001B1UO6W", "B00001QGUM", "B0000AOX09", "B000AM6OQ2", "B0001CNRRU", "B00000IQC4", "B001D8W7EK", "B00005A06N", "B000IMUYJM", "B000055Y0X", "B00005LC4Q", "B00001U0BN", "B003ZYU3U0", "B00AEFY37C", "B001JV5BIA", "B00079Z9VO", "B00000ILDD", "B00004BZIY", "B0001611DI", "B00000CQJZ", "B001D8W7F4", "B0024FADD8", "B00011CZRE", "B00AJLHUA8", "B00005JKF6", "B000NVT0SO", "B00006FDCD", "B0013D8LA4", "B000WC3864", "B0013D8LAE", "630512003X", "B004SIP92O", "B000AA4JL6", "B000CCW2SY", "B00000C0QO"], "bought_together": ["B000Q66Q8I", "B0087ZG7PW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005EVY8MQ", "B0087ZG7R0", "B000Q66Q8I", "B0087ZG7PW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 24947}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.95, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "0783225849", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515ZHBJZdgL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Psycho (Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "Clint Eastwood's second film as a director (and his first Western) is a variation on the &quot;man with no name&quot; theme, starring Eastwood as the drifter known only as &quot;the Stranger.&quot; He rides into the desert town of Lagos and is quickly attacked by three gunmen. Recovering with the aid of a local dwarf (a memorable role for Billy Curtis), the Stranger is hired by the intimidated townsfolk to fend off a band of violent ex-convicts. After teaching the citizens self-defense and instructing them to paint the entire town red and rename it &quot;Hell,&quot; the Stranger vanishes. He reappears when the marauding criminals arrive, and delivers justice and teaches the townsfolk a harsh lesson about moral obligation. Is he a figure from their past or a kind of supernatural avenger?

{"description": "The original 1960 version ofVillage of the Damnedis regarded as a classic of science-fiction and horror, and it remains one of the creepiest movies of its kind. Directed with occasional flair by John Carpenter, this 1995 remake trades subtlety for more explicit chills and violence, but the basic premise remains effectively eerie. In the tiny, idyllic town of Midwich, a strange mist causes the entire population to fall asleep, and when everyone awakes the town physician (Christopher Reeve) discovers that 10 women--including his wife and a local teenaged virgin--have mysteriously become pregnant. Their children are all born on the same day, with matching white hair and strange, glowing eyes, growing at an accelerated rate and raising Reeve's suspicion that they're not of Earthly origin. These demonic brats can control minds and wreak havoc with the power of their thoughts--so of course, they must be destroyed! Only Reeve knows how to get the job done, and his performance (the actor's last big-screen role before his paralyzing accident in 1995) grounds this otherwise superfluous remake with enough credibility to hold the viewer's attention. But for the real chills, definitely check out the original version--it's 20 minutes shorter but twice as spooky.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00027JYMG", "B0000AOX0A", "B00EALTVPA", "B0053TWVDC", "B0052DP1TA", "6305258287", "B005CFBZVG", "B00009PY4G", "B00D7AM5XU", "B000TUDBFC", "B0000AOX0F", "B00EALTWJ0", "B00AEFYDM2", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B00HW3EJ6Y", "B0002O7XW2", "B00DBNLAZW", "B00005N5RM", "B0052XU4BK", "B00A1AU72A", "B0009X76XC", "B00K1L4NBU", "B00IYJRIKO", "B000HCO86I", "B000AM6OQ2", "B000HEWEGC", "B00009PY2T", "B00AEBB91O", "B007XF0W3K", "B000G1ALDY", "B0001FVDQ4", "B00AEFYUW0", "B001B8XRT6", "B00EF0NY7W", "B00GHH9GSC", "B00004TS0G", "B000FFJZO2", "B004P7CMHI", "0790742462", "B00004Y87O", "B0026ICAOS", "B00CPTUNUG", "B00027JYNK", "B008SGMPVU", "B00008974J", "B004P7CN7W", "B0000AOX09", "B009IV2Z3M", "B00009NHC7", "B008874968", "1573624101", "B00C7E3EFU", "B001P3SAAI", "B003JFCG82", "B004XVMCN0", "B00GHH9IIA", "B008VF0Y0M", "B000V4UFZK", "B0002IQLH6", "B00003CY6P", "B00BW4S87U", "B00IQHPS6A", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00C2CDJ34", "B00096S48U", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B0002V7OI8", "B0024FADD8", "078062856X", "B000FGFBUS", "B00D7AM698", "B001AQMBNC", "B000TSIJWY", "B00000IQC4", "0783116926", "B00DOB3N56", "B0053TWV46", "B000RXVNDI", "B00005JOJE", "B00AGKH4MG", "B00KMAVPW0", "B00006FDCD", "B00AEBB91E", "B00BCMSY80", "B00003CWRF", "B00JJOY47I", "B00A429Y56", "B00D97DMBU", "B001ECDVKE", "B00079Z9WI", "B002NZK5SM", "B00004W3HF", "B005CFBZQ6", "B00ARWX9NG", "B0000AOX0E", "B002AS45VK", "B004BLJQOK", "B00HF00RJW", "B00D7AM5U8", "B000063UR0"], "bought_together": ["B00027JYMG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00027JYMG", "B0024FADBA", "B000AM6OQ2", "B0000AOX0F"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 44546}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.5, "brand": "Universal", "asin": "0783230427", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XFND15HNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Village of the Damned"}

In a very smart first 10 minutes, new toy-company owner Denis Leary tells his crew he wants toys \"that play back.\" Hence the small soldiers land in Anytown, U.S.A., and the loner kid Alan (Gregory Smith) opens them up before they are supposed to be on the shelves. Those military-grade chips sure make them smart and give the toys plenty of pithy retorts to boot. Plenty of violence, er, action, most of it fun enough. The vocal talents, including Tommy Lee Jones, Frank Langella, and cast members ofThe Dirty Dozenare inspired characters, the humans less so. WithGremlinsdirector Joe Dante at the helm, it plays like a sequel to that '80s fantasy.

{"description": "Kevin Costner is the big name here, but the film belongs squarely to Elijah Wood, who plays his son. The film deals with the children of a Vietnam veteran in 1970 Mississippi; as their dad (Costner) tries to cope with posttraumatic stress disorder after serving in the war, the kids build a mammoth tree house in the woods--then must defend it against the local white-trash bullies. The film includes a particularly harrowing contest involving a swim across the reservoir of a decrepit water tower; still, director Jon Avnet can't avoid a certain \"can't we all just get along\" didactic message.

{"description": "Robert Cummings stars as Barry Kane, a patriotic munitions worker who is falsely accused of sabotage, in this wartime thriller from Alfred Hitchcock. Plastered across the front page of every newspaper and hated by the nation, Kane's only hope of clearing his name is to find the real villain. If this sounds a bit like Hitchcock's laterNorth by Northwest, it is. There are interesting echoes throughout, including a heart-stopping sequence on top of a national monument. But the most interesting thing aboutSaboteuris the frequency with which characters demonstrate their willingness to obstruct the police, going on nothing more than the fact that Kane seems like a stand-up guy. They do, again and again, apparently just because good people can spot other good people.Saboteurwas made during the thick of World War II, so there are a few passages of heavy-handed jingoism to get through but they're relatively painless. The script as a whole is a clever one--Algonquin wit Dorothy Parker shares a screenwriting credit, and her trademark zingers make for a terrific mix of humor and suspense.Saboteuris a pleasure whether you're a die-hard Hitchcock fan or just someone who likes a good nail-biter.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300183580", "0783235682"], "also_viewed": ["B001D8W7EA", "B000A1INJE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 450820}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.45, "brand": "", "asin": "0783236344", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5110R9HJEJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Saboteur [VHS]"}
{"description": "Great period pictures make you feel as if you've stepped into another  era, heard its language, breathed its spirit, and come away with a fresh  perspective on that time as well as your own.Ride with the Devilis one  of those special films--why wasn't it more widely embraced by reviewers and  filmgoers? Did it rely too much on our patience for slow accumulation of  unforced rhythms and meanings (as opposed toThe Patriot, which \"moved\"  audiences with cattle-prod simplicity and manipulation)?Ride with the  Devil--smart, handsome, tenderly awed by how individual lives get ambushed  by history--is ripe for rediscovery.The Civil War of battlefields and plantation houses is nowhere to be seen  here. Instead we see the war as an improvised and largely blundering but very  bloody feud among neighbors in the border state of Missouri. In this bucolic war  zone--more than a little reminiscent of the Balkans in the late 1990s--the  Taiwanese-born director Ang Lee (Sense and Sensibility) traces the  destinies of several young Southern bushwhackers (guerrilla fighters) as they  experience violence, the seasons, and different kinds of love. Skeet Ulrich  draws the aristocratic glamour role (and top billing), but he's overshadowed by  Tobey Maguire as a first-generation American, the magnificent Jeffrey Wright (a  shameful oversight at Oscar time) as a freed slave fighting beside his former  master, and singer Jewel in a very natural acting debut as the young widow who  graces all their lives. The titleThe Birth of a Nationwas already  taken, but by the end of this movie you feel it would have applied here.-- Richard T.

{"description": "Stanley Kubrick dissects the nature of violence in this darkly ironic, near-future satire, adapted from Anthony Burgess's novel, complete with \"Nadsat\" slang. Classical music-loving proto-punk Alex (Malcolm McDowell) and his \"Droogs\" spend their nights getting high at the Korova Milkbar before embarking on \"a little of the old ultraviolence,\" such as terrorizing a writer, Mr. Alexander (Patrick Magee), and gang raping his wife (who later dies as a result). After Alex is jailed for bludgeoning the Cat Lady (Miriam Karlin) to death with one of her phallic sculptures, Alex submits to the Ludovico behavior modification technique to earn his freedom; he's conditioned to abhor violence through watching gory movies, and even his adored Beethoven is turned against him. Returned to the world defenseless, Alex becomes the victim of his prior victims, with Mr. Alexander using Beethoven's Ninth to inflict the greatest pain of all. When society sees what the state has done to Alex, however, the politically expedient move is made.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790734079", "0790705141", "B00004U8PA", "B00000FZCU", "6303953425", "6304484054", "0783235607", "6304039220", "630268644X", "B00006G8O1", "0790700506", "B0002G2B2W", "6305576173", "B000059HCI", "B00008X5J1", "0792837797", "B00000J2KZ", "6300267881", "6301977742", "6300216713", "6300269132", "B00000I1DI", "6302783356", "6300214826", "6305095566", "B00005JLET", "6302054982", "0800103106", "6302201845", "6302798450", "B00000J2L7", "6304994540", "6303686796", "B00005PJ8I", "6300216500", "0783228317", "6303107338", "6304935811", "B00004W5UA", "6302610702", "0783246641", "6300183211", "6302921058", "0792842111", "B00004T37H", "B00002E285", "B00003CXE6", "B000007OY0", "6301971582", "6300184064", "B00005LL26", "0790736039"], "bought_together": ["0790734079", "0790705141"], "also_viewed": ["0393312836", "0790705141", "B0013FSXT6", "B00GGAK0FS", "B008RO875Q", "B004O724M2", "B00004TLMC", "B00023NRSM", "B008M4MB8K", "6305440093", "6303953425", "6303939015", "6303148387", "6303861733", "B00003CXB4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 296220}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790701022", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EV1DQCCGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Clockwork Orange"}
{"description": "When it was announced that Tom Cruise would play the vampire Lestat in this adaptation of Anne Rice's bestselling novel, even Rice chimed in with a highly publicized objection. The author wisely and justifiably recanted her negative opinion when she saw Cruise's excellent performance, which perceptively addresses the pain and chronic melancholy that plagues anyone cursed with immortal bloodlust. Brad Pitt and Kirsten Dunst are equally good at maintaining the dark and brooding tone of Rice's novel. And in this rare mainstream project for a major studio, director Neil Jordan compensates for a lumbering plot by honoring the literate, Romantic qualities of Rice's screenplay. Considered a disappointment while being embraced by Rice's loyal followers, the movie is too slow to be a satisfying thriller, but it is definitely one of the most lavish, intelligent horror films ever made.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000069I1I", "B000TGJ80S", "B00027JZ3E", "B00AEBBA72", "B0050MB3MM", "B0002KVUKM", "B002U4UZSQ", "6305258287", "B0009MDPYM", "B002ZG97CO", "B00004WG2F", "B001VLFE7G", "B00005JM5B", "B0085A9HU6", "B00006JDU8", "B00011CZRE", "B005CFBZWK", "0783229526", "B00AEFYMGO", "0345385403", "B004P7CMOQ", "B0009A40ES", "B002GSXKNI", "B001GCUO0W", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00005JL78", "B004BLJQOK", "B005COLESQ", "0783233477", "B003Y5H5EW", "B000BRBA9C", "B004P7CN7W", "0767811097", "0345337662", "B004P7CN5O", "B002T9H2LA", "B00004W4UD", "B004QSQMKE", "B002AF4Y9G", "0800177789", "B000035Z5G", "B000BKVQS4", "B00003CXSD", "B00001PE4D", "0800141806", "B00BHBOOIU", "B000P0J0EM", "B003M987PQ", "B006VRRGNK", "B008QE9XD2", "0792839137", "B00005JLKN", "B002O3Z4ZW", "0783225482", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00009AOBI", "6305313687", "B0002KVULG", "B001AGXEAG", "B00005JLSB", "B00018D42W", "B00AEBBAEK", "B003Y5H54W", "B00AEFY5B6", "B002VWNIDG", "B00AEFXYJA", "0800177029", "B000JLQQ94", "6305718954", "B000OCY7TY", "B000NOKFHQ", "B000P0J0D8", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00003CXWV", "B000AYELVA", "B005NKIPUY", "B0013FCWUW", "B0007WFX62", "B008R65XYC", "B0041KKYEM", "B00BZZMXMW", "B002NZK5V4", "B000P0J09M", "B00000G3R0", "B00005UQ9W", "0345443683", "B004SIP7TE", "B0001US62I", "B003PIUINS", "0307291650", "B000FKO5QK", "B0012Q7M02", "B0000AC8LI", "B001MYIXAC", "B005LAIHXQ", "B0009X76XC", "B000FFJYBG", "B002NZK5VO", "B00AEFXQ9S"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000069I1I", "B00011CZRE", "B00004WG2F", "B000P0J09M"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 82136}, "asin": "0790729687", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516RX1MMY2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Interview With the Vampire"}
{"description": "Director William Friedkin was a hot ticket in Hollywood after the success ofThe French Connection, and he turned heads (in more ways than one) when he decided to makeThe Exorcistas his follow-up film. Adapted by William Peter Blatty from hiscontroversial bestseller, this shocking 1973 thriller set an intense and often-copied milestone for screen terror with its unflinching depiction of a young girl (Linda Blair) who is possessed by an evil spirit. Jason Miller and Max von Sydow are perfectly cast as the priests who risk their sanity and their lives to administer the rites of demonic exorcism, and Ellen Burstyn plays Blair's mother, who can only stand by in horror as her daughter's body is wracked by satanic disfiguration. One of the most frightening films ever made,The Exorcistwas mysteriously plagued by troubles during production, and the years have not diminished its capacity to disturb even the most stoical viewers. The film is presented in letterbox format on digital video disc, with a soundtrack that's guaranteed to curdle your blood.

{"description": "From its cleverly choreographed opening sequence to its heart-stopping climax on a rampant carousel, this 1951 Hitchcock classic readily earns its reputation as one of the director's finest examples of timeless cinematic suspense. It's not just a ripping-good thriller but a film student's delight and a perversely enjoyable battle of wits between tennis pro Guy (Farley Granger) and his mysterious, sycophantic admirer, Bruno (Robert Walker), who proposes a &quot;criss-cross&quot; scheme of traded murders. Bruno agrees to kill Guy's unfaithful wife, in return for which Guy will (or so it seems) kill Bruno's spiteful father. With an emphasis on narrative and visual strategy, Hitchcock controls the escalating tension with a master's flair for cinematic design, and the plot (coscripted by Raymond Chandler) is so tightly constructed that you'll be white-knuckled even after multiple viewings.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002HOEQ2", "B000CCW2SY", "B000ECX0O2", "B0045HCJ9E", "B00871C09S", "B0087ZG7R0", "B001D8W7EK", "B00000CQJZ", "B000A9QK7I", "B00AEBB97S", "B000CCW2TS", "B001D8W7F4", "B000ECX0Q0", "B0002HOEQM", "B001D8W7EU", "B0087ZG7OI", "B00000C0QO", "B002GSXKQA", "B000CCW2U2", "B0002HOER6", "B0087ZG7PW", "B000ECX0S8", "6305999872", "B00AEBB89C", "B003ZEQMH8", "B0002HOEQW", "B00004XPPK", "B000A1INJE", "B00008LDNZ", "B0002HOEQC", "B000CCW2UW", "B000FFJYA2", "B009RWRINE", "B000CCW2UC", "B0002HOEPS", "B0050FXDDQ", "B002VWNIAY", "B005EVY8MQ", "B0006HBV3C", "B0010YSD7W", "B00K6D1QV8", "B000025RE7", "B005H8G78O", "B000MGBSDK", "B007Y1NR1W", "B000PMFRVU", "B00005LC4D", "B0009ML1Z2", "B00065GX64", "B0045HCJQW", "B00AEBBA7W", "B00003CXBZ", "B000244F2S", "B0000549B1", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B008BFSMBA", "B000ECX0QU", "B000FFJYAW", "B004NWPY3E", "B00006RCO1", "B00005AUK9", "B0045HCJ8U", "B00AEFYO5I", "B0008ENIAC", "B00005JKF6", "B000CNE088", "B00DZP1C9K", "B00005RDRL", "B000UVV25Q", "B002945DUM", "B0045HCJHG", "B00AEFXD1O", "B0002ERWZ0", "078323502X", "B000KGGJ1I", "B00003CXBU", "B006TTC5WC", "B000KIX8VK", "B00000JNVC", "B00004W229", "B004CZRE44", "B00AEBB8OC", "B00AMEZDK6", "B000FFJYAC", "B006FE83UE", "B0007US7EY", "B0010AN7Z4", "B000CNE08I", "B0014Z4OMU", "B00553K8DQ", "B000B8380A", "B000244EYW", "B0009S4IKQ", "B00074DY0M", "B00004TJKI", "B005152C9G"], "bought_together": ["B0002HOEQ2", "B0045HCJ9E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00871C09S", "B0002HOEQ2", "B000CCW2SY", "B0045HCJ9E"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 124487}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.89, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "0790731029", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J4BhbK2UL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Strangers on a Train"}
{"description": "Irish writer-director Neil Jordan followed up his surprise hitThe Crying Gamewith this controversial biography of IRA leader Michael Collins (Liam Neeson), one of the most important political leaders of the 20th century. The film follows Collins as he matures from guerrilla leader to national hero and statesman. Jordan's take on Collins is that he was set up by Irish president Eamon De Valera (Alan Rickman), who was jealous of Collins's legendary popularity. De Valera puts Collins in the position of negotiating a peace treaty that would never satisfy the Irish hero's hard-core followers. When the IRA leader returns with a first-step compromise, De Valera undercuts Collins's popularity by refusing to support the revised treaty. And the civil war continues for months.Michael Collinsoccasionally loses focus and momentum, but is the kind of exciting historical drama that deserves to be called &quot;sweeping.&quot; It is also one of the most beautifully photographed films in years: cinematographer Chris Menges uses color and texture to set moods and accent emotions. The movie also stars Aidan Quinn, Julia Roberts, and Stephen Rea.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000OCY7JO", "0783227906", "B00005V1WP", "B00008DDHZ", "B000005IQX", "B003498SCQ", "B004TPJN9Q", "B0009G3BCY", "B000AQKV1C", "0783227329", "B00078XGRY", "B000CBG5PQ", "B00000F3FS", "B005SH65G8", "B00000ILEC", "0312295111", "079283366X", "B009YX8MSG", "B00004TJKJ", "B00007K02D", "0767802578", "B004U7MR1Y", "B007UW9W5U", "B004XVMCQ2", "B0002V7SOS", "B003LL3FIY", "0792163087", "B000JYW5AK", "B002U2Q0EG", "B000189LE2", "0767833600", "B00018D3L4", "B005WAP2V0", "B00008DDVT", "B00BJ0OO7A", "B004IY6A0S", "0312294166", "B001ADXX1E", "B004AN0CRO", "1561310700", "B00065GX96", "B005HT404G", "B000002JBE", "0753818523", "B005LAIIRQ", "B002LYD2MG", "6305796297", "B00004W4UB", "1617430277", "B0000714BW", "B003UAKEBW", "B0001I55SI", "B002YMWPUA", "B0038N9X3Q", "B000NOIVT0", "B00DMDSC4S", "B00008PC13", "1573629723", "B000G6ORIE", "0765326930", "B0000EYUBQ", "0783226810", "B000GG4Y32", "B00008UALI", "B00005V5NU", "B0006HBLLY", "1592282822", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B00007K02C", "B0009X75OC", "0449906825", "B003498S2G", "B005WKH3AI", "0230109527", "B00013RC84", "B009YX8LO6", "B00003CXBH", "0316485063", "B000255LIY", "B00004Y87L", "B004A8ZX28", "B00DHN8G3U", "B00008CMRK", "B00005V9HK", "B001A7GODO", "B002XUL6RG", "B00BTYJYR6", "0783241909", "B00J5LXQX8", "B00B0U2SFE", "B00441GZ46", "6305558167", "1597975354", "B000CJ2E5I", "6305428395", "B000R7HY00", "B00005AUKA", "0812570804", "B00664AM02", "B00DL48BM6"], "bought_together": ["B000OCY7JO", "0783227906"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000OCY7JO", "B00005V1WP", "0783227906", "B00004TJKJ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30581}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 35.95, "brand": "NEESON,LIAM", "asin": "0790729407", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QNJ8NQKDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Michael Collins"}
{"description": "The most viscerally frightening and disturbing homicidal-maniac picture sinceThe Silence of the Lambs,Sevenis based on an idea that's both gruesome and ingenious. A serial killer forces each of his victims to die by acting out one of the seven deadly sins. The murder scene is then artfully arranged into a grotesque tableau, a graphic illustration of each mortal vice. From the jittery opening credits to the horrifying (and seemingly inescapable) concluding twist, director David Fincher immerses us in a murky urban twilight where everything seems to be rotting, rusting, or molding; the air is cold and heavy with dread. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are the detectives who skillfully track down the killer--all the while unaware that he has been closing in on them, as well. Gwyneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey are also featured, but it is director Fincher and the ominous, overwhelmingly oppressive atmosphere of doom that he creates that are the real stars of the film. It's a terrific date movie--for vampires.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005V9HH", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000M341QE", "0783240295", "B00003CXZ4", "6305313687", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000P0J0EW", "B000LP6KNU", "B000P0J09M", "B000P0J0AG", "B000069HZP", "B004SIP95G", "B0009A40ES", "B0007PALZ2", "B002NZK5RI", "B002AF4Y9G", "B00AEBB89W", "B004SIP7VM", "B00AEFXQ9S", "B00004BZIY", "B003ASLJO0", "B00003CXWV", "B00096S49Y", "B00AEFYF2K", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00008975Z", "B002T9H2LA", "B00005JLKN", "B000LC55F2", "0767802519", "B004FQX5B6", "B002VWNIEA", "B004SIP7TE", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00AEFXEGS", "0792846435", "B00003CXSP", "B002VWNICC", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000C20VPA", "B00AEFXESQ", "B000P0J0EM", "B000093FLA", "B002ZG99N6", "B002NZK5VO", "B003LR5BD0", "B002VWNIDG", "B000I2J736", "B0001FR3IQ", "B00AEFYYH6", "B000F5GNX8", "B002ZG980U", "B00005JN0W", "B00005JMJG", "B0000AC8LR", "B003ASLJQI", "B000E5N684", "B002XMGGK6", "B003HKN52U", "B00AP2DC94", "B00001ZWUS", "B000A2UBN4", "B000244GCW", "B000A7DVR2", "B002GHHHN8", "B00004WG2F", "B00AEFXKUI", "B001R3YRG2", "B002NZK5UU", "B00004XPPG", "B0034G4P7G", "B000FKO5QK", "B0009MDPYM", "B000NVT0SO", "B003ASLJQS", "B00005JPD0", "B00005JKWX", "B000YAF4MA", "B00005JKIS", "6305065551", "0783229526", "0783233477", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00005JA8B", "B00AEFXYJA", "B0000YEEGM", "B007D5E7C2", "B0002V7ON8", "B000N6U0E2", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00AEBB8LA", "6305718954", "B002AT8K9W", "B00AMSLDTM", "B000FS9FCG"], "bought_together": ["B0007DFJ0G", "6305313687"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004LWZW4M", "B00005V9HH", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000P0J0EW"]}, "price": 13.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 172718}, "asin": "0790729989", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VQ890AJML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Seven (Widescreen)"}
{"description": "When Ridley Scott's cut ofBlade Runnerwas finally released in 1993, one had to wonder why the studio hadn't done it right the first time--11 years earlier. This version is so much better, mostly because of what's been eliminated (the ludicrous and redundant voice-over narration and the phony happy ending) rather than what's been added (a bit more character development and a brief unicorn dream). Star Harrison Ford originally recorded the narration under duress at the insistence of Warner Bros. executives who thought the story needed further \"explanation\"; he later confessed that he thought if he did it badly they wouldn't use it. (Moral: Never overestimate the taste of movie executives.) The movie's spectacular futuristic vision of Los Angeles--a perpetually dark and rainy metropolis that's the nightmare antithesis of \"Sunny Southern California\"--is still its most seductive feature, an otherworldly atmosphere in which you can immerse yourself. The movie's shadowy visual style, along with its classic private-detective/murder-mystery plot line (with Ford on the trail of a murderous android, or \"replicant\"), makesBlade Runnerone of the few science fiction pictures to legitimately claim a place in the film noir tradition. And, as in the best noir, the sleuth discovers a whole lot more (about himself and the people he encounters) than he anticipates.... With Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, Daryl Hannah, Rutger Hauer, and M.

{"description": "Twisterwas a mega-million-dollar blockbuster--helmed by a director (Dutchman Jan de Bont) hot off another scorcher hit (Speed)--that flaunted state-of-the-art digital effects and featured a popular leading actress (Helen Hunt) who would win an Academy Award for her next film (As Good As It Gets). But ask anybody who's seen it and they'll tell you who the real star ofTwisteris: the cow. Not to give anything away, but the cow is one of those inspired little touches (like, say, Bronson Pinchot's career-making cameo inBeverly Hills Cop) that adds a touch of personality to a gigantic Hollywood production. The story is blown out the window after an impressive prologue in which Hunt's character, as a little girl, witnesses her daddy being sucked into a tornado. Basically, Hunt and Bill Paxton are thrill-seeking meteorologists chasing twisters in order to study them (and help warn people of them, of course) with a new technology they've developed. If you thought the Kansas tornado inThe Wizard of Ozwas every bit as scary as the Wicked Witch of the West, then this may be the movie for you.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783225547", "B00E8G5HQE", "B00008G8M4", "B0002V7OI8", "B00000G3PA", "B00005JMXX", "B000P0J0C4", "B0006GANOQ", "B002GIBVVG", "B00AEFXPSK", "6304806434", "B001OFM2TC", "B0045HCJFS", "B0057RCFQS", "0783225733", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000N4RAS8", "B000P0J09W", "6304711891", "B00004Z4WR", "B007STBUHI", "B007SPPANM", "B00E8G5HZ0", "B001OQCV2E", "B0013BM63O", "B00AEFXPMG", "B000QUCRB4", "6305236569", "B000EHSVPK", "B002GHHHKQ", "B000EGDB10", "B00026ZG10", "B000QUU4LY", "B00AEFY4CG", "0800195175", "B001LXIDW2", "0790732149", "1558908315", "B00177YA1K", "B0007PLLBU", "B00003CXFV", "B00081U7HC", "6305212112", "1603800875", "B000JYW5BE", "B0068FZ0O2", "0783235070", "B00003CXTG", "B000FO0AA6", "B000ETRA5U", "B00005JN5E", "B001LXIDVS", "B006VRRGNK", "B0068FZ0GK", "B0013FDM7E", "B00003CXSM", "B00004XPPG", "B000CEV3M8", "6304765266", "B001LXIDVI", "B000QUCQX8", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00393SG1U", "0790730979", "B00AEFXE9U", "B00AEFXXMI", "B000EHSVNW", "0767803434", "B004AOECXI", "B000GRUMPU", "B001ECDVK4", "630471193X", "B00008WFU4", "B005QW98NM", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEBB8NS", "B000SFOW8I", "B00AEFYW64", "B002NZK5V4", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B00008G6E8", "B0045HCJT4", "0783223609", "B00000IQC4", "B00005ATZT", "B00008WFU5", "B00008K76U", "B00AEFY5TI", "B0006FYOTC", "B007IUEE0C", "B00AEFY0F2", "B0002CHK1S", "0783225504", "B001CRC4DG", "B00407PO3W", "B002XUBDRY", "B0000844I8", "0800177258", "B00005JNTI"], "bought_together": ["B00008G8M4", "B00000G3PA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00634MLO0", "B00008G8M4", "B005LAIIPS", "0783225733"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 91188}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790729636", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GW5RZP9SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Twister"}
{"description": "A favorite film of some of the world's greatest filmmakers, including Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg, John Ford'sThe Searchershas earned its place in the legacy of great American films for a variety of reasons. Perhaps most notably, it's the definitive role for John Wayne as an icon of the classic Western--the hero (or antihero) who must stand alone according to the unwritten code of the West. The story takes place in Texas in 1868; Wayne plays Ethan Edwards, a Confederate veteran who visits his brother and sister-in-law at their ranch and is horrified when they are killed by marauding Comanches. Ethan's search for a surviving niece (played by young Natalie Wood) becomes an all-consuming obsession. With the help of a family friend (Jeffrey Hunter) who is himself part Cherokee, Ethan hits the trail on a five-year quest for revenge. At the peak of his masterful talent, director Ford crafts this classic tale as an embittered examination of racism and blind hatred, provoking Wayne to give one of the best performances of his career. As with many of Ford's classic Westerns,The Searchersmust contend with revisionism in its stereotypical treatment of \"savage\" Native Americans, and the film's visual beauty (the final shot is one of the great images in all of Western culture) is compromised by some uneven performances and stilted dialogue. Still, this is undeniably one of the greatest Westerns ever made.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300268470", "630197705X", "0792106989", "6301325508", "0782008348", "6303057225", "6300181588", "6300268799", "0792102320", "6301797922", "6301802330", "6303192254", "0792838556", "6301805518", "6304071876", "6301798759", "6300184951", "6300269884", "6300267830", "1555265952", "6300181715", "0792107128", "6303599052", "6300208281", "0783221347", "B00004RFFA", "6304457308", "6304457278", "079284517X", "6301977165", "6300268748", "B000051S3Z", "B001E419N8", "B000M7BEPQ", "B000GX4476", "0792110188", "6301628454", "6300988473", "0800132009", "B000059HGY", "6301805615", "B00004WZR1", "6301670159", "0792107683", "630310374X", "0783235607", "6303942830", "6302884438", "6305237115", "630150528X", "0792834879", "0790743213", "0783235593", "6304259131", "6301798503", "630018224X", "6302130379", "B000006N70", "6304935811"], "also_viewed": ["6303599052", "6303168507", "6300269884", "6301802330", "0792106989"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 293111}, "asin": "0790736918", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G79RSPRAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Searchers [VHS]"}
{"description": "Winner of the Academy Award&reg; for best picture of 1989, this gracefully moving drama, adapted from the hit play by Alfred Uhry, chronicles the 25-year friendship between a stubborn, aging Southern widow (Jessica Tandy) and her loyal chauffeur (Morgan Freeman). At first, the self-sufficient Miss Daisy is reluctant to accept the services of a chauffeur, but Hoke is quiet, wise, and tolerant, and as the years pass the unlikely friends develop a deep mutual respect and admiration. Tandy deservedly won the Oscar for her sassy and sensitive performance, and Freeman earned an Oscar nomination for bringing quiet depth and integrity to his memorable role. Ironically, director Bruce Beresford (Tender Mercies) was not nominated, but the film won Oscars for makeup and for Uhry's screenplay, in addition to a supporting actor nomination for Dan Aykroyd as Daisy's supportive son. Delicate, funny, and bittersweet,Driving Miss Daisywas a surprise hit when released, and marked the crowning achievement of Tandy's great career.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305212112", "B0000JBALO", "B00004TJKK", "076780676X", "B00005NRN8", "B003ASLJK4", "B00AEBB9FA", "0783240171", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000P0J092", "B00001W9G0", "B004A8ZWVK", "B006FE83UE", "B000765IJK", "B004SIP7F8", "B001VC99HQ", "B00DDT0JB0", "B00AEFXYOA", "B000TXP56C", "B004SEUJOQ", "B000YAF4MA", "B004FQX5A2", "B001ECDVJU", "0767836359", "B003LMPKSQ", "B00AEFXD1O", "B002M2Z3BA", "B004AOECXI", "B00AEFY4CG", "6305128952", "0800141806", "B00004XPPC", "B00005MEOU", "B002NZK5RS", "B0045HCJ76", "B00006G8GZ", "B008B9JTFO", "B000JYW5B4", "B001ECDVK4", "6305236569", "6305428352", "B00AFEYJ80", "B000XJD34I", "6305133468", "B001NLJ3NU", "B00AEFYK5M", "B002VWNICM", "B00AATV07S", "B00020HAV0", "B007SPPANM", "B00020HAWE", "B000PHVZNE", "B002VECM6S", "B000065FJC", "B002VWNIAY", "B00011D1OU", "B00006RCO2", "B004SIP6C2", "B0010AN7Z4", "B000E6ESI0", "B0045HCJJY", "B0000YTP02", "6305213283", "B000EHRVOW", "6304907729", "B00K6D1QV8", "B00404ME1A", "B000JU8H9C", "B00EV4EUT8", "B000059HAN", "B00005AUKE", "B0009S4IKQ", "B005HWAOP2", "B007N31YH0", "B00AEFY9GW", "B000QQLVPQ", "B000KJTGHO", "B00AEBBACM", "630471193X", "B000244GCW", "B002HK9IDQ", "B000YDBPAM"], "bought_together": ["6305212112", "B0000JBALO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000JBALO", "6305212112", "B00DDT0JB0", "B003ASLJK4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 77014}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790730987", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4161YA15GNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Driving Miss Daisy"}
{"description": "In the fourth and reportedly final film of theLethal Weaponseries, director Richard Donner reunites with Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, who reprise their roles as Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh for one last hurrah in a film that is decidedly better than the third and first chapters. This time the pair are pitted against Jet Li, who plays the leader of a Chinese  organized crime unit. Li, a veteran of hundreds of Hong Kong action films, more than holds his own against the more established team of Gibson, Glover, Renee Russo, and Joe Pesci with his subtle yet strong portrayal of the quietly irrepressible Wah Sing Ku. As always with theLethalseries, the plot is incredibly simple to follow: someone steals something, someone gets killed, and Murtaugh is reluctantly thrown into the mix while Riggs dives into the case with gleeful aplomb. As with the previous movies, we watch for the sheer action and chemistry alone. The action sequences throughout the fourth installment are exquisite, from the opening scene involving a flamethrower, a burning building, and a half-naked Murtaugh strutting like a chicken (don't ask, just watch), to the climactic showdown that pays genuine tribute to Jet Li's masterful martial art skills. As for chemistry, the bond between these characters is so strong by now that you sometimes feel like you're watching a TV series in its sixth season, such is the warm familiarity between the audience and the personalities on the screen. The humor is more fluid than ever, aided immeasurably by the casting of comedian Chris Rock, who like Li does a great job of making his presence known in some memorable verbal tirades that would bring a smile out of the Farrelly brothers. But it's the verbal and emotional jousting between Glover and Gibson that makes this fourth episode especially appealing; both are in peak form with great physical and verbal timing. One can only hope that if this is indeed the last of theLethalfilms, that it won't be the last time we see Glover and Gibson together on screen.--Jeremy Storey", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300271331", "6302596092", "6301572688", "6301017080", "B000U1ZV8K", "6304681496", "6304007523", "6302765536", "B00004XPQ6", "6302091632", "6304932553", "080010367X"], "bought_together": ["6300271331", "6302596092"], "also_viewed": ["6301572688", "6302596092", "6300271331"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 396077}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.18, "brand": "", "asin": "0790738945", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516WCCP833L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lethal Weapon 4"}

{"description": "Actor Griffin Dunne improves a bit on his first film as a director,Addicted to Love, with this drama-comedy about a family of witches. Nicole Kidman and Sandra Bullock play spell-casting sisters of different temperaments: the former is a high-living, free-spirited sort, while Bullock's character is a homebody who can't get around a family curse that kills the men in their lives. A widowed single mom, Bullock gets into a jam with an abusive Bulgarian (Goran Visnjic) and is helped out by her sibling, but the result brings a good-looking, warm, inquisitive cop (Aidan Quinn) into their lives. The film has a variety of tonal changes--cute, scary, glum--that Dunne can't always effectively juggle. But the female-centric, celebratory nature of the film (the fantasies, the sharing, the witchy bonds) is infectious, and supporting roles by Dianne Wiest and Stockard Channing as Kidman and Bullock's magical aunts are a lot of fun.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305428042", "B000FFJYBG", "B00004W4UD", "B002NZK5RS", "B00006ZXSQ", "0425190374", "B00000DAGF", "6304765266", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B00006ZXSK", "B000CEV3M8", "B00AEFXYOA", "B002K0WBXW", "B00004UEDQ", "B00007E2F5", "0783235380", "B0000524E5", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00008NRI7", "B00005JNY3", "B005FH1RRI", "B001AGXEAG", "0783225482", "B000NA1WDQ", "B00004TJKK", "B0007Z9R66", "B000YDBPAM", "B0000714BP", "B00081U7HC", "B007TBJUW2", "B000765IJK", "B003PIUIJC", "B0002W4UDE", "B002SYAGNC", "B002ZG976U", "B00066FB2A", "B0000AOV4I", "B0007PLLBU", "B000056T4I", "B00002SSKI", "B002NZK5VO", "B002GOAH10", "B000BNX3B4", "6305428395", "B002AS464Q", "B008F283VS", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B0047685GO", "B0038N9X3Q", "630587493X", "6305236569", "B00AEFXO8Q", "6305212112", "B00000JGHN", "B00AMEZDJW", "B00006ZXSL", "B000HEWEE4", "B00068GTK6", "B000MQC9H4", "B0007Z9R5W", "B000067J1O", "B004SIP92O", "B00465I16K", "6305433925", "6305428425", "630471193X", "0399140557", "B002O3Z50G", "B002GOAGZC", "B0000DIXDR", "B000P0J08S", "B00005JPD0", "B004GSVXCG", "B0007ZEOD2", "B001CFEBW0", "B00AEFXZJE", "B00AEBB8NS", "B000A343RI", "B001Y8DJVE", "B00441GYVK", "B00AEBBA72", "B0036TGSIK", "B004SIP8LG", "B00DCRE87O", "B000QGDY0G", "B000Y9PC7S", "B002AT8KAG", "B000NA1WE0", "B0032XNKY0", "B002GHHHNI", "B00005JLNZ", "B005F2JRUC", "B004SIP8JI", "B0045HCJGC", "B0009OL7Z4", "B000V4UFZK", "B00AEFY4CG", "B002JT69IW", "B00001PE4D", "B004499LWG"], "bought_together": ["6305428042"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003F1804E", "6305428042", "B005FH1RRI", "B002NZK5RS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 34642}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.22, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "0790740060", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/416BJPBTHBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Practical Magic (Snap Case Packaging)"}

{"description": "Otto Preminger's sprawling World War II drama packs a lot into its 165 minutes, beginning with the attack on Pearl Harbor (which Preminger re-creates in amazing detail) and ending a couple of years later with America's return to the South Pacific in force. John Wayne and Kirk Douglas star as a career naval captain and his self-pitying commander in the peacetime navy who are thrust into battle when Pearl Harbor is bombed while they are on maneuvers. Minutes into WWII, they are already scapegoated and demoted by the embarrassed military brass. Wayne romances a WAVE nurse (Patricia Neal) and attempts a reconciliation with his estranged, spoiled son (Brandon de Wilde) while Douglas sinks into the bottle after the death of his cheating wife until the American fleet rebuilds and calls upon Wayne to lead one of the initial invasion forces. Henry Fonda makes a brief but commanding appearance as the fleet admiral. Burgess Meredith is a former writer turned witty commander, Dana Andrews a showy but indecisive admiral, and Stanley Holloway a genial Australian scout working with the American invasion forces. Tom Tryon and Paula Prentiss play newlyweds torn apart by the war, and also appearing are Franchot Tone, Carroll O'Conner, Slim Pickens, George Kennedy, Bruce Cabot, and Larry Hagman, among many, many more. Loyal Griggs's handsome black-and-white photography is topped only by Saul Bass's impressive closing credits sequence, a rising cascade of crashing waves and rough surf reportedly paced to mirror the dramatic rhythm of the film.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300181472", "6300988473", "6300215733", "0792106989", "6301802330", "6300208281", "B001E419N8", "6300267938", "6303057225", "6301798090", "630197705X", "0783216084", "6301325508", "6302320496", "6301736362", "B00004RFFA", "6301718275", "6301797922", "0792110188", "6303192254", "0792108868", "6300267830", "0792839846", "6304457316", "0782008348", "6304457278", "6302923042", "6304457308", "6300268748", "B000051S3Z", "6300268799", "6303599052", "B00005Q4GZ", "0792838556", "630150528X", "B000M7BEPQ", "6301662962", "6303597874", "6300183513", "0792107683", "6300184951", "6302224462", "6300246965"], "bought_together": ["6300181472"], "also_viewed": ["6303057225", "6302365945", "6303599052", "6303231799", "6301976924"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 210560}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0792102320", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NK7XC5KEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "In Harm's Way [VHS]"}
{"description": "A stupendous historical saga,Braveheartwon five Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director for star Mel Gibson. He plays William Wallace, a 13th-century Scottish commoner who unites the various clans against a cruel English King, Edward the Longshanks (Patrick McGoohan). The scenes of hand-to-hand combat are brutally violent, but they never glorify the bloodshed. There is such enormous scope to this story that it works on a smaller, more personal scale as well, essaying love and loss, patriotism and passion. Extremely moving, it reveals Gibson as a multitalented performer and remarkable director with an eye for detail and an understanding of human emotion. (His first directorial effort was 1993'sMan Without a Face.) The film is nearly three hours long and includes several plot tangents, yet is never dull. This movie resonates long after you have seen it, both for its visual beauty and for its powerful story.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004XPQ6", "B00003CXE6", "6303953425", "6304935811", "B0001VL30O", "B000054OW2", "6302415853", "0790741512", "6304071876", "6301792734", "6303168507", "6303942830", "0800125762", "6300183211", "B000007OY0", "B000056BRF", "6300214540", "B000065U6Q", "B00004WIDB", "B00003CXTF", "B00007KK15", "079070546X", "B0000A36J1", "B00000K3AN", "6302482712", "6300263673", "6305169187", "0788811355", "B00003BE3X", "0800116917", "6304414099", "6303020089", "0792133153", "0790744589", "6302909023", "0800132009", "079212569X", "6300185095", "6303313345", "0767819462", "6304259131", "B00000K2SC", "0800199421", "B0001DI5W6", "B00005JLTM", "630018224X", "0790701251", "6304151306", "6303696813", "0790731274", "0792147618", "B00005RIJ3", "6301586026", "6302945089", "0783223218", "6305718792"], "bought_together": ["B00004XPQ6", "B00003CXE6"], "also_viewed": ["0792151712", "6303314015", "6301966988", "6303402348", "B00004WIDB", "0792116887", "6300213668", "0800125762", "B00004XPQ6", "0792842111", "B00003CXTF", "0788812408", "6302526574", "6303215734", "0788806270", "6300183211", "B00004U8P4", "0788802194"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 256531}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.94, "brand": "", "asin": "079213690X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5109NVE2R9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Braveheart [VHS]"}

{"description": "At her job, driving instructor Abbie (Madonna) has no problems getting her students to bend over backwards and tie themselves into knots for her. But in life she can't seem to find anyone to tie the knot with her. Robert (Everett), her best friend and confidant, runs a successful landscaping business but is having equally dismal luck finding his Mr. Right. When Abbie's latest relationship crumbles, she turns to Robert (who happens to be gay) for comfort and advice. They commiserate over a parade of margaritas and martinis, which results in an unexpected tryst. Abbie becomes pregnant and believing, that this may be her one shot at motherhood, decides to have the child. Robert, committed to being a good father, moves in with her, and together they create an unconventional but loving home for their precocious son, Sam (Stumpf). Robert continues to date but keeps parenting as his first priority. Abbie, on the other hand, uses her yoga skills to remain celibate but finally relents when she meets Ben (Bratt), a handsome and charming investment banker. Romance flowers between Abbie and Ben, and as they grow closer Robert feels his role as father threatened. Tensions mount, and when Abbie and Ben announce plans to be wed, the family explodes over a heart-wrenching custody battle for Sam. Everett sparkles and Madonna oozes her usual cool in this drama/comedy from the director of MIDNIGHT COWBOY.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BYA4JM", "B00007L4OE", "B0009JMKIW", "B00006L92K", "0792845773", "B0075564A8", "B0002UGVHO", "6305327041", "B002JM1VJG", "6305610444", "B00009NHAJ", "B0001IN0QW", "0800177258", "6304498977", "B000KGGLCU", "B00005T7I1", "B00606P044", "6304806418", "B00008S2VG", "B00DQVSTCG", "B00005JG6N", "B00005AUJO", "B002ZFQD04", "B00005QX8H", "B00D2UMHGA", "B0000DZ6N3", "B00443FMZM", "B001EDVNNU", "B00008G7UH", "B00FEXL3OA", "B00004GOVT", "B0059XTV4Y", "B008NNY8SQ", "B002GNOSFM", "B00756GKBA", "B0074JOU8I", "B007L6VMDK", "B00004XPPD", "B005LAIIB2", "B00AZ8RA3M", "B008BJU1XI", "B005UQQR06", "B00DQVST76", "B000002MUW", "0792843983", "0792833198", "B000002N3J", "B00004Y32O", "B00C5SE8F8", "B009IQG5LK", "B0045HCJGW", "B000B8QEZG", "B000002NJS", "B000FA57RG", "B000069HYG", "B0009RCPUW", "B001WAKFP2", "B00019GHQQ", "B00081U7HC", "B000UOGHKS", "B001P42YA4", "B0015D3Z4O", "B00000F0AD", "B0009HKH6Q", "B000Y11B7Q", "B00066FAC6", "B00005JN3W", "6305622914", "B007W2MKFM", "6305428271", "B006GGREO2", "B00CY5Y398", "6305718954", "B005C6BGVY", "0783114907", "0767821769", "B0002MHDW4", "B0006GANPA", "B00006ZXSL", "B0001Z37HM", "B004SIP9VA", "6306012419", "B0007XBM02", "B00AEBB9SM", "B000N0W9WO", "B00003CXFV", "B00AEFY5TI", "B008OHV68Q", "6305133468", "B00386EZKE", "B00049QQHI", "B00DW5IL92", "6304907729", "B000BQ5JAE", "B00AEFXZ1C", "B00070HK24", "B00026ZG10", "B007XTDWKQ", "6305428506"], "bought_together": ["B00007L4OE", "B000BYA4JM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BYA4JM", "B0075564A8", "B00009NHAJ", "B00006L92K"]}, "price": 29.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 99911}, "asin": "0792166736", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5156TNTKG2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Next Best Thing"}
{"description": "What a combo! Tobe Hooper, the director ofThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre, teamed up with family-oriented producer Steven Spielberg to makePoltergeist. The film is about a haunted suburban tract home in a development very much like the Arizona one in which Spielberg was raised. (Because it came out the same summer as Spielberg'sE.T., it was tempting to see both movies as representing Spielberg's ambivalent feelings about childhood in suburbia. One was a fantasy, the other a nightmare.)  Spielberg also cowrote the screenplay, which taps into primal, childlike fears of monsters under the bed, monsters in the closet, sinister clown faces, and all manner of things that go bump in the night. At first, some of the odd happenings in the house are kind of funny and amusing, but they grow gradually creepier until the film climaxes in a terrifying special-effects extravaganza when 5-year-old Carole Anne (Heather O'Rourke) is kidnapped by the spooks and held hostage in another dimension. Though not nearly as frightening as Hooper's magnum opus, or the originalA Nightmare on Elm Street, which came along two years later,Poltergeistis one of the smartest and most entertaining horror pictures of its time.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00009PY4G", "B00006FDCD", "B00AEFYYH6", "B007STBUHI", "B004SIP92O", "B00004BZIY", "B000VECAD0", "B00000IQC4", "B00005A8XX", "B004LWZW24", "B001B1872U", "B009XTF8KQ", "B00386EZUY", "B000HCO86I", "B00005JOJE", "B0087F7VSY", "B001D2WU9I", "B000PMLJMQ", "B000067FP8", "B000E1P2EY", "B003PIUINI", "B0009X763M", "B000WC3864", "B003UN0752", "B002I41KNC", "B0021L8UFI", "B005GT3X68", "B000P0J0A6", "B0087ZG7PW", "B00AIBZLVY", "B0045HCJJE", "B000ASATZ8", "B0000VCZK2", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00005JNTI", "B000E33W1W", "B00008LUNW", "B00AEBBA2W", "B000CCBC9O", "B0006SGYL0", "B000FAOC2W", "B00008WFU4", "B000OA8OK4", "B00005JNNT", "B001AGXEAG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004TDTO", "B00004BZIY", "B000VECAD0", "B00006FDCD"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 69740}, "asin": "0792833201", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31ZsC3YTJ5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Poltergeist"}
{"description": "When it was released during Hollywood's golden year of 1939,The Wizard of Ozdidn't start out as the perennial classic it has since become. The film did respectable business, but it wasn't until its debut on television that this family favorite saw its popularity soar. And whileOz's TV broadcasts are now controlled by media mogul Ted Turner (who owns the rights), the advent of home video has made this lively musical a mainstay in the staple diet of great American films. Young Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland), her dog, Toto, and her three companions on the Yellow Brick Road to Oz--the Tin Man (Jack Haley), the Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr), and the Scarecrow (Ray Bolger)--have become pop-culture icons and central figures in the legacy of fantasy for children. As the Wicked Witch who covets Dorothy's enchanted ruby slippers, Margaret Hamilton has had the singular honor of scaring the wits out of children for more than six decades. The film's still as fresh, frightening, and funny as it was when first released. It may take some liberal detours from the original story by L. Frank Baum, but it's loyal to the Baum legacy while charting its own course as a spectacular film. Shot in glorious Technicolor, befitting its dynamic production design (Munchkinland alone is a psychedelic explosion of color and d&eacute;cor),The Wizard of Ozmay not appeal to every taste as the years go by, but it's required viewing for kids of all ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005F96UJ6", "B0000VCZKM", "B00E9ZATKI", "0792839749", "B0087F7VSY", "B0090XLDKY", "B002M2Z3BA", "076781326X", "B00C7JGDBW", "B000P0J09W", "B000URDCC6", "B002HK9IDQ", "B0000DZ3EN", "B000RPCK2E", "B000065V42", "B001JV5BF8", "B0000AM6IY", "B00335EQ0E", "B005NFJAZS", "B003VS0CX8", "B0000VCZKW", "0062278010", "B002NZK5SW", "B0010X744G", "B00CQRN3QI", "B0009XT8ME", "B000HT3PGU", "B006VJ1AAI", "B00005RRG7", "B008H6GHEM", "B00GVFJ5QS", "B00HVBB140", "B002VWNIAY", "B000BT970O", "B002CLBJPK", "0060293233", "B00028HBES", "B00322XV8Q", "B00EV1YZ96", "B000AJJNIG", "B00AATV0WS", "B0054OGQM8", "1495421864", "0739060821", "B00AEFXMGU", "0792833759", "B00AMSQBNK", "B000TPTCP0", "B0009X75QU", "B00ITVMMOY", "B00005RRGB", "B0017Q0SJ4", "0767836324", "B004302N2Q", "084318017X", "B001GLX6UI", "B003YBW2Y4", "1402766254", "B00019GHU2", "B00003CXCQ", "B00AMSM9CW", "B00005JG6M", "B0047QLNUY", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B00447L4JG", "0767819659", "B00000JPH6", "B002BIGCXS", "B00G5G7EXY", "B0000AK7AB", "B006FE83UE", "B002VWNIBI", "B00005JL1P", "B001ILFUDC", "0800177258", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00005RDSQ", "B00JHH1ZN8", "B0006IINYQ", "B0015NORDW", "B002GHHHNS", "B0013ND30M", "0792838408", "B001AGXEAG", "B0047CG9F2", "B00006ADD5", "B0013FSL3E", "B00079Z9VO", "B00F6SHECS", "B0008JIJ2E", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00005JN4W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HVBB140", "B005F96UJ6", "B0000VCZKM", "B00I6JOD2S"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 206236}, "asin": "0792833171", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GYW80GAJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Wizard of Oz"}
{"description": "David Lynch peeks behind the picket fences of small-town America to reveal a corrupt shadow world of malevolence, sadism, and madness. From the opening shots Lynch turns the Technicolor picture postcard images of middle class homes and tree-lined lanes into a dreamy vision on the edge of nightmare. After his father collapses in a preternaturally eerie sequence, college boy Kyle MacLachlan returns home and stumbles across a severed human ear in a vacant lot. With the help of sweetly innocent high school girl (Laura Dern), he turns junior detective and uncovers a frightening yet darkly compelling world of voyeurism and sex. Drawn deeper into the brutal world of drug dealer and blackmailer Frank, played with raving mania by an obscenity-shouting Dennis Hopper in a career-reviving performance, he loses his innocence and his moral bearings when confronted with pure, unexplainable evil. Isabella Rossellini is terrifyingly desperate as Hopper's sexual slave who becomes MacLachlan's illicit lover, and Dean Stockwell purrs through his role as Hopper's oh-so-suave buddy. Lynch strips his surreally mundane sets to a ghostly austerity, which composer Angelo Badalamenti encourages with the smooth, spooky strains of a lush score.Blue Velvetis a disturbing film that delves into the darkest reaches of psycho-sexual brutality and simply isn't for everyone. But for a viewer who wants to see the cinematic world rocked off its foundations, David Lynch delivers a nightmarish masterpiece.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304510861", "6303018351", "0790705141", "6300182770", "6302185882", "6303515304", "6300147630", "6304346158", "6300214044", "6302226899", "B000067DGJ", "B00004T37H", "0792839846", "630026999X", "0792846303", "6303422969", "0783229585"], "also_viewed": ["6302185882", "6300182770"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 325598}, "asin": "0792838084", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71W22ZVC1XL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Blue Velvet [VHS]"}
{"description": "Truly ridiculous but somehow moving, this right-wing paranoid fantasy by John Milius (The Wind and the Lion) from 1984 concerns a Soviet takeover of the United States and a band of ragtag adolescents who metamorphose into freedom fighters. One can laugh at the notion of Nicaraguans, Cubans, and Russians having worked out a master plan to invade America, but Milius's account of how such a grim day affects a small Western town really does get under one's skin. The cast--most of whom were not yet stars (Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey had probably never heard of a script calledDirty Dancingat the time)--are quite persuasive as nice kids who come to recognize the tragedy of their lost innocence through fierce, uncompromising struggle. Powers Boothe is very good as a pilot who briefly comes to their aid, and Harry Dean Stanton is stirring as a solid working man and father who represents the virtues his sons are fighting for.

{"description": "Perhaps best known for its faux Springsteen soundtrack, the 1983Eddie and the Cruisersis a rock lover's fantasy run wild. The story finds a reporter (Ellen Barkin) tracking down rumors of an unreleased album by a band whose charismatic leader (Michael Par&eacute;) allegedly died years before. As she approaches surviving members--who have since gone on to other things--she gets different points of view on Eddie's life and artistic drive, and the mystery about that album deepens. The trouble with the film is simple: it's impossible to accept. Michael Par&eacute; is far from suitable to play a Jersey shore rocker with thematic pretensions toward Rimbaud that go back to the '60s, and the soundtrack by John Cafferty sounds like a hack's rendition of E Street Band magic.

{"description": "Stanley Kubrick wrote the story and produced, edited, shot, and directed his second feature like a one-man studio, and his developing cinematic intelligence turns an otherwise unremarkable story into a memorable if slight film, a hint at masterpieces to come. Jamie Smith is a washed up prizefighter who rushes to the rescue of his platinum blonde dime-a-dancer neighbor (Irene Kane) when she's attacked by her dapper hoodlum boss (Frank Silvera). Smith and Kane fall in love, but their plans to  leave gritty New York for a simpler life in Seattle are jeopardized when jealous Silvera sends his thugs to lean on Smith. Mistaken identities and an overzealous beating lead to murder, kidnapping, and a desperate confrontation between Smith and Silvera in an eerie warehouse full of mannequins. Disembodied heads, swinging hands, and the blank stares of rows of lifeless dummies become a cold counterpoint to the sweaty, almost primal fight as Silvera wields an ax and Smith counters with a pike like gladiators in an abstract arena. The gray cityscape of New York (shot on location) turns into stark black and white and the city looms over the characters as the  tension tightens. Kubrick's sophisticated use of sound and austere visual style creates a hyper-realistic atmosphere, which he would put to even better use in his follow-up film, the heist classicThe Killing.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005152C9G", "B007K8ILTW", "0792841409", "B007K8ILUQ", "B005152C78", "B000UJ48VI", "B000UJ48SQ", "B003WKL6YO", "0783226039", "B0039ZBM64", "B000UJCAKY", "B0057UA4CW", "B004O724M2", "B0013D8LKO", "B0057UA486", "B00ICWO1LC", "B001DJLCPE", "B00023P4GA", "B0013FSXT6", "B000B83846", "6305999872", "B00000K3D3", "B001FAZBLC", "B000055Y0X", "B000P0J09C", "3836527758", "B0000549B1", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B00012L786", "B00005Y70Q", "B000Q66J1M", "B0024FAG8A", "B000M2E3GI", "B004L9GMBC", "B00023P4II", "B0006Z2NDQ", "B00006RCNV", "1578062977", "B000WC39ZY", "B000B8384Q", "6305941122", "B00008978N", "B00023P4G0", "B000UJ48UO", "B00005ATQB", "B009X919UE", "B00004W229", "B000286RPM", "B00023P4FQ", "B000087F79", "0306809060", "B000Q678OO", "B00008RH3J", "B004PF0FJM", "B00003CXXP", "B002VWNIDG", "B000EXDSBQ", "B00000G02H", "B002QFYJF4", "B00AQ6J5JU", "B000CNE08I", "B0006Z2NE0", "B004C2523M", "B0024FAG80", "B000CNE088", "B005KQVE1S", "B00BGARG3C", "B00AEFXV3E", "B00B2BYXYA", "B00D6I7EGQ", "B003VMFWYI", "B001TIQT6G", "B004O724NG", "6305291470", "B000CNE08S", "B00004Y62V", "B00HZJH97Q", "B005SYZZ7Q", "B00D09AXUA", "B0087ZG7R0", "B004VA0R7Q", "B00007ELDG", "B0000CNY4M", "B000244EZ6", "B004CIIXG4", "B000PKG6OE", "B0050FXDDQ", "0253213908", "B008220DGE", "B00AEBB89C", "B002VKE1K2", "B000286RP2", "B000002LCG", "B0052SO06A", "B000FKO3VM", "B00092ZLEE", "B0089LT800", "B00CUKTGSA", "B00005AUK9", "B001P3SA8A"], "bought_together": ["B005152C9G", "B007K8ILTW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005152C9G", "0792841409", "B007K8ILTW", "B000UJ48SQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 84060}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.88, "brand": "SILVERS,FRANK", "asin": "0792841387", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71TXWF8E3NL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Killer's Kiss"}

{"description": "Rain Manis the kind of touching drama that Oscars are made for--and, sure enough, the film took Academy honors for best picture, director, screenplay, and actor (Dustin Hoffman) in 1988. Hoffman plays Raymond, an autistic savant whose late father has left him $3 million in a trust. This gets the attention of his materialistic younger brother, a hot-shot LA car dealer named Charlie (Tom Cruise) who wasn't even aware of Raymond's existence until he read his estranged father's will. Charlie picks up Raymond and takes him on a cross-country journey that becomes a voyage of discovery for Charlie, and, perhaps, for Raymond, too.Rain Manwill either captivate you or irritate you (Raymond's sputtering of repetitious phrases is enough to drive anyone crazy), but it is obviously a labor of love for those involved. Hoffman had been attached to the film for many years, as various directors and writers came and went, but his persistence eventually paid off--kind of like Raymond in Las Vegas. Look for director Barry Levinson in a cameo as a psychiatrist near the end of the film.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FVQLQQ", "B00AEFY0F2", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000066HAS", "0800141741", "B004FQX5B6", "B0043X1FL8", "0767811100", "B0018QPPXW", "B000P0J0EW", "B000065V3G", "B00AEFXYJA", "B000ZM1MG4", "B0002WZTOI", "B001680M26", "B00005B6JZ", "B002VWNIBI", "0800141806", "B000P0J0EM", "B00079Z9VO", "B00AEFYSWM", "B00AEFY4CG", "B007SPPANM", "B00005MEOU", "0792833287", "B00081U7HC", "6305144168", "B006TTC5HC", "B00AEFXR1K", "B0000DIXDR", "B00AEBB9LO", "B004U7MR1Y", "B00AEFYRP0", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00AEBB9FA", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00003CWQR", "B00006RCO1", "B000LP6KNU", "0783226810", "B004AOECXI", "B00AEFZ63M", "B000PHVZNE", "B007N31YH0", "B000GAKDAG", "B0000JBALO", "B002NZK5UU", "B00000IQV7", "B00011CZRE", "B000CNESTE", "B000035Z5G", "B00004WG2F", "B00008EY60", "B000ZM1MGE", "0780619587", "0784011710", "B00AEBB99Q", "B000G6BLHY", "079284646X", "B00008K76U", "0767836359", "B00AEFXXMI", "B0068FZ0GK", "B00026ZG10", "B00AEFXKUI", "0767803434", "B00005M2CO", "6305236569", "0783225733", "B00AEBB9UK", "0792833198", "B001AEF6BI", "B000HEWEJO", "B002M2Z3BA", "B001KRCDSO", "B00006RCO3", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00B0U2SFE", "B00AEBB9SM", "B000067IZ3", "B0006GANOQ", "6304712936", "B00001ZWUS", "B000VECAD0", "B000KX0IOA", "6304907729", "B000055Y0Y", "B0002B15ZG", "6304711891", "6305213305", "630471193X", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B00007BKVC", "B00AEBB95K", "B00003CWRX", "B0008ENHUI", "B000765IJK", "B00004TVUD", "B004FQX5A2", "B00005ATZT"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFY0F2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004SIP7ZS", "B00AEFY0F2", "B0094V8OXG", "0783226845"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 40583}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0792833260", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514MRDGQE7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rain Man"}

{"description": "Regardless of whether it was \"too early\" in 2006 to dramatize the events of September 11th, 2001, \"World Trade Center\" succeeds as a tribute to the courage and sacrifice of those who served at \"ground zero\" in the wake of terrorist attacks on the WTC's twin towers in New York City. Removed from the politics of war and terrorism (yet still, like all films, inherently political in expressing its point of view), Oliver Stone's potent drama focuses on the nightmarish ordeal, and subsequent rescue, of Port Authority policemen John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and Will Jimeno (Michael Pe?a), who were buried deeply within the rubble of the WTC after the twin towers collapsed. Granted, it's only the film's historical context that distinguishes it from any other dramatic rescue story, but in focusing on the goodness of humanity in response to the evil of terrorists who remain unnamed and off-screen, Stone and first-time screenwriter Andrea Berloff create an emotional context as powerful as anything Stone has directed since \"Platoon\". Even as he resorts to some questionable tactics typically lacking in subtlety, Stone refrains from much of the blunt-force filmmaking that has made him a critical punching bag, rising to this challenging occasion with a heartfelt and deeply American portrait of unity ' personal, familial, and national. Flaws and all, \"World Trade Center\" serves an honorable purpose, reminding us all that for those fleeting days in September 2001, America showed its best face to a sympathetic world. --\"Jeff Shannon\"", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000GH3CR0", "B000EYJHDS", "B0006L0L5C", "0783223609", "B001F5274G", "B004X7UAMO", "B004WCSMDE", "B0000B1OBZ", "B008L0YN4U", "B005KBJC0I", "B00006B1HI", "B001MVWFAO", "B00AEBB8JM", "B00827OX5Q", "B00K2CHX9C", "B00K2CHW48", "B00006BS70", "B00003CXTG", "B00005JN5E", "B000065U1N", "B005VU9KW8", "B00006409F", "B000065Q9C", "B00AEBBA36", "B00AEFYENK", "B000KF0GWW", "B00063MCHA", "B004XFZ4JK", "B0013BM63O", "B00000G3PA", "B001MVYUR0", "B005DR64OQ", "B00005JK8K", "B00102F5WK", "B00005JM0O", "B0002V7ON8", "B004EPYZOO", "B007IUEEA2", "B000ELL1R6", "B000BBOUW2", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B000OVLBF8", "B000HRMAPE", "B003BV8ICM", "B000MGB6NM", "B001J710Z2", "B00005JMXX", "B001GCUO02", "B0015D20FE", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00005PJ8T", "B0077ATSSQ", "B001N44BVQ", "B008JFUNKU", "B00BUH1QHS", "B005F2JRUC", "B0002ZSKMS", "B004FQX59I", "B000GRUMRS", "B000FWHW7C", "B00AZNEW5G", "079284646X", "B00BTYMPX6", "B000059TG6", "B00012QLB4", "B00004Z4WR", "B000FUF6QI", "B007XF0W9O", "B00260HH2G", "B00008G8M4", "B000M4RG42", "B003ASLJQS", "B001SGEUYW", "B00GSBQ2HU", "B000JYW5DW", "0783225733", "B004A2AN5G", "B000BYA5G4", "B000A3XY5A", "B00001ZWUS", "B000EGDB10", "B0007KIFGE", "B000ZS8GWQ", "B00005JLRE", "6304711891", "6304806434", "B002NZK5VO", "B000P0J0C4", "B002O3Z50G", "B005LAIGYQ", "B002NXSRVG", "B00DZP1C2W", "B00005JNEI", "B00HEPE6MM", "B001HQZJMU", "B00HW3LAF2", "0800177967", "B000P0J09C", "B00AEFXGIY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000GH3CR0", "B0006L0L5C", "B000EYJHDS", "B001F5274G"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 748872}, "asin": "1415726698", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F3dNW-7-L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "World Trade Center"}

{"description": "Perhaps only the collective brilliant minds of the Monty Python film and television troupe are up to the task of tackling a subject as weighty as the Meaning of Life. Sure, Kierkegaard, Wittgenstein, and their ilk have tried their hands at this puzzler, but only Python has attempted to do so within the commercial motion picture medium. Happily for us all,Monty Python's the Meaning of Lifetruly explains everything one conceivably needs to know about the perplexities of human existence, from the mysteries of Catholic doctrine to the miracle of reproduction to why one should avoid the salmon mousse to the critical importance of the machine that goesping!Using fish as a linking device (and what marvelous links those aquatic creatures make),The Meaning of Lifeis presented as a series of sketches: a musical production number about why seed is sacred; a look at dining in the afterlife; the quest for a missing fish (there they are again); a visit from Mr. Death; the cautionary tale of Mr. Creosote and his rather gluttonous appetite; an unflinching examination of the harsh realities of organ donation, and so on. Sadly, this was the last original Python film, but it's a beaut. You'll laugh. You'll cry (probably because you're laughing so hard). You may even learn something about the Meaning of Life.

{"description": "From a match made in heaven comes a movie spawned in hell! Young hotshot director Robert Rodriquez (El Mariachi,Desperado) teamed up withPulp Fictionauteur Quentin Tarantino (offering his services as writer and co-star) to make this outrageous, no-holds-barred hybrid of high-octane crime and gruesome horror. QT plays Richard Gecko, a borderline psychopath who breaks his career-criminal brother, Seth (George Clooney), out of prison, after which they rob a bank and leave a trail of dead and wounded in their bloody wake. Then they hijack a mobile home driven by a former Baptist minister (Harvey Keitel) who quit the church after his wife's death and hit the road with his two children (played by Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu). Heading to Mexico with their hostages, the infamous Gecko brothers arrive at the Titty Twister bar to rendezvous for a money drop, but they don't realize that they've just entered the nocturnal lair of a bloodthirsty gang of vampires! With not-so-subtle aplomb, Rodriguez and Tarantino shift into high gear with a nonstop parade of gore, gunfire, and pointy-fanged mayhem featuring Salma Hayek as a snake-charming dancer whose bite is much worse than her bark. If you're a fan of Tarantino's lyrical dialogue and pop-cultural wit, you'll have fun with the road-movie half of this supernatural horror-comedy, but if your taste runs more to exploding heads and eyeballs, sloppy entrails and morphing monsters, the second half provides a connoisseur's feast of gross-out excess.Bon app&eacute;tit!--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002AF4Y9G", "B000UAE7O0", "B000R7HY0K", "B004U7MR14", "B000P0J0D8", "6305327041", "B0000A2ZU1", "B004SIP9Z6", "B004SIP95G", "B002T9H2LA", "B00008975Z", "B007D5E7C2", "B002ZG98C8", "B0000WN140", "B007D0FVRM", "B005LAIIJY", "6305428468", "B00005JMUA", "B0045DO81U", "B00005JMEW", "630569270X", "B0009A40ES", "B001VLBDD0", "B0000A2ZTY", "B003Y8YB3C", "B0031P77RU", "B00027JZ3E", "B00070FX5U", "B000ASDFI6", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00004Y87O", "B000A2UBN4", "B000OVLBHG", "B00005O5AY", "B00011CZRE", "B000K7VHNW", "B000093FLA", "B0024FADD8", "6305258287", "B000WC3864", "B003HKN52U", "B001CDFY50", "B000AXWHSA", "B00111YM5Q", "B000EHRVP6", "B002VWNIDG", "B000P0J09M", "0767811054", "B004P7CN7W", "B00005QJHP", "B00AEFYYWQ", "0767802519", "B00GDDNFDW", "0783229526", "B008CYDD7I", "B008LC8V1Y", "B0007DFJ0G", "B001KRVLCI", "B00005JKWJ", "B000RTB0R6", "0783229402", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B00003CXWV", "B00005JLRE", "B002U4UZSQ", "B000LP6KNU", "B00AKGG828", "B002WY65VU", "B005J9ZFQG", "6305594333", "B0007KZQAM", "B000C20VRS", "B000056PMU", "6304765258", "B00005N5S5", "B00006CXGP", "B003PIUINS", "6305065551", "B00005JA8B", "B0002ABURA", "B00001QGUM", "B003AWRMCE", "0800177789", "B000022TSY", "B003TRMLQM", "B00008RH3J", "B00AEFXESQ", "B0002KVULG", "B002GSXKNI", "B002JT69IW", "B0085A9HU6", "0780618548", "B000055Y0Y", "B004P7CMOQ", "B006CXIKYC", "0792846435", "B00AEBBADG", "B00AEFY5B6", "0767817664", "B00005V9HH"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004P7CMOQ", "B000UAE7O0", "B004SIP95G", "B004SIP9Z6"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 216353}, "asin": "1558908455", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517ESWW8VSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "From Dusk Till Dawn"}

{"description": "In what may be the angriest portrait of Cuba ever made, director Leon Ichaso (Crossover Dreams) charts the journey of one young man from patriot to disillusioned dropout to angry rebel. Gustavo (Ren&eacute;  Lavan) is an idealistic young Marxist scholar who dreams of attending the University of Prague. When he falls for an earthy dancer with a more pragmatic view of her homeland, who plans to escape to Florida, his ideals are systematically chipped away in the face of poverty, repression, corruption, and police brutality until it all becomes too much for him to bear. A far cry from the more romantic work of Tom&aacute;s Guti&eacuterrez; Alea (Strawberry and Chocolate), this film speaks volumes about a generation of exiles burning with anger and hate for Castro and his regime. It's also manipulative and heavy-handed, with Gustavo less a hero than a straw figure poised for a fall, and it's far less revealing than such self-critical Cuban features asPortrait of TeresaandMemories of Underdevelopment. But its vivid and passionate feelings of betrayal can hardly be dismissed.

{"description": "Die-hardBeavis and Butt-headfans will probably enjoy this incidental \"best of\" compilation, which contains seven segments pulled from MTV, aggregated into a 50-minute presentation. But creator Mike Judge's two nerdy, sexually piqued high school delinquents pale in the shadow of that other animated wonder,South Park. In fact, Beavis and Butt-head seem a little pass&#xE9; in light of the success of rival network Comedy Central and its wunderkind, junior high school-based series created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone ofBASEketballfame. Consequently, the segments rely on the same tired jokes again and again (\"heh-heh, heh-heh, he said 'come'\") and by the time Beavis chows down on too much sugar and his alter-ego, Cornholio, appears in episode six, we're struggling with the woeful repetition and limitations of the boys' routine. The best is saved for first on the disc because the segment entitled \"No Laughing\" is at least somewhat original in spirit. It may be that we haven't yet been dumbed down by the one-trick pony parade.

{"description": "Andrei Konchalovsky's expansive television mini-series production of Homer's epic poem gets off to clumsy start as he tries to squeeze the Trojan War into a mere half hour, but once the arrogant but honorable Odysseus (strikingly played by Armand Assante) and his loyal crew begin their doomed voyage home, this film turns into a fantastical adventure. Integrating often-stunning special effects with inventive art design, Konchalovsky achieves a beautiful look on a limited budget as he follows the 10-year ordeal of Odysseus from his battles with the Cyclops and the magical Circe (Bernadette Peters) to his secret homecoming and his confrontation with the treacherous Eurymachus (Eric Roberts). Isabella Rossellini appears as his spiritual guide, the goddess Athena, with Greta Scacchi as Odysseus's faithful wife and Vanessa Williams as the seductive Calypso. The rest of the cast includes Geraldine Chaplin, Jeroen Krabb&eacute;, Christopher Lee, and Irene Papas. The production was shot on location in and around the Mediterranean, making for a lush, lovely visual experience.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001DZOCY6", "B000HWZ4AC", "B0041SI78O", "B002O3Z50Q", "B00AMEZDPG", "B00005JMH8", "B004YAEB6Q", "6300216039", "0764585991", "B000K7VHLY", "B000A6T1ZE", "B00003CXRM", "B00003E46G", "6304773528", "1576901351"], "bought_together": ["B001DZOCY6"], "also_viewed": ["B0041SI78O", "B004YAEB6Q", "B001DZOCY6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 241663}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.88, "brand": "", "asin": "1574924494", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CXVSNYW4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Odyssey [VHS]"}

{"description": "Jean-Jacques Annaud'sThe Name of the Roseis a flawed attempt to adapt Umberto Eco's highly convolutedmedieval bestsellerfor the screen, necessarily excising much of the esoterica that made the book so compelling. Still, what's left is a riveting whodunit set in a grimly and grimily realistic 14th-century Benedictine monastery populated by a parade of grotesque characters, all of whom spend their time lurking in dark places or scuttling, half-unseen, in the omnipresent gloom. A series of mysterious and gruesome deaths are somehow tied up with the unwelcome attention of the Inquisition, sent to root out suspected heretical behavior among the monastic scribes whose lives are dedicated to transcribing ancient manuscripts for their famous library, access to which is prevented by an ingenious maze-like layout.Enter Sean Connery as investigator-monk William of Baskerville (the Sherlock Holmes connection made explicit in his name) and his naive young assistant Adso (a youthful Christian Slater). The Grand Inquisitor Bernado Gui (F. Murray Abraham) suspects devilry; but William and Adso, using Holmesian forensic techniques, uncover a much more human cause: the secrets of the library are being protected at a terrible cost. A fine international cast and the splendidly evocative location compensate for a screenplay that struggles to present Eco's multifaceted story even partially intact; Annaud's idiosyncratic direction complements the sinister, unsettling aura of the tale ideally.--Mark Walker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000007PI4", "630027120X", "B00000F13M", "6304111398"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 187985}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6300146030", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21QPB3PM5GL.jpg", "title": "The Name of the Rose [VHS]"}

{"description": "Like the Greenwich Village courtyard view from its titular portal, Alfred Hitchcock's classicRear Windowis both confined and multileveled: both its story and visual perspective are dictated by its protagonist's imprisonment in his apartment, convalescing in a wheelchair, from which both he and the audience observe the lives of his neighbors. Cheerful voyeurism, as well as the behavior glimpsed among the various tenants, affords a droll comic atmosphere that gradually darkens when he sees clues to what may be a murder.Photographer L.B. \"Jeff\" Jeffries (James Stewart) is, in fact, a voyeur by trade, a professional photographer sidelined by an accident while on assignment. His immersion in the human drama (and comedy) visible from his window is a by-product of boredom, underlined by the disapproval of his girlfriend, Lisa (Grace Kelly), and a wisecracking visiting nurse (Thelma Ritter). Yet when the invalid wife of Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr) disappears, Jeff enlists the two women to help him to determine whether she's really left town, as Thorwald insists, or been murdered.Hitchcock scholar Donald Spoto convincingly argues that the crime at the center of this mystery is the MacGuffin--a mere pretext--in a film that's more interested in the implications of Jeff's sentinel perspective. We actually learn more about the lives of the other neighbors (given generic names by Jeff, even as he's drawn into their lives) he, and we, watch undetected than we do the putative murderer and his victim. Jeff's evident fear of intimacy and commitment with the elegant, adoring Lisa provides the other vital thread to the script, one woven not only into the couple's own relationship, but reflected and even commented upon through the various neighbors' lives.At minimum, Hitchcock's skill at making us accomplices to Jeff's spying, coupled with an ingenious escalation of suspense as the teasingly vague evidence coalesces into ominous proof, deliver a superb thriller spiked with droll humor, right up to its nail-biting, nightmarish climax. At deeper levels, however,Rear Windowplumbs issues of moral responsibility and emotional honesty, while offering further proof (were any needed) of the director's brilliance as a visual storyteller.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790743213", "0783221347", "6304039530", "6300181340", "0783235593", "6300183580", "6300215741", "6301798503", "0783235607", "6305123616", "0792839846", "0783222955", "B0002IXSVI", "630150528X", "6301647734", "6304429274", "B0000040EO", "6302797667", "1558807780", "0783235704", "0792837614", "0783236352", "0783235623", "6301734734", "0790743159", "6305576173", "6304359705", "0783235682", "B00005A06N", "6304119097", "630266232X", "6301964012", "6300181529", "630233683X", "6301670159", "B00000F13T", "6301977084", "6301976061", "0792837649", "6303494390", "0782008348", "6300215512", "6305282927", "B00001OWYM", "B00005N5S2", "6303215734", "6300215717", "B000005PPB", "0783235674", "6305012792", "6304196954", "0800132009", "6302241103", "0792841859", "6304071876", "6302909023", "B00AEFXD1O", "B00000F3QZ", "6301607929", "6301978110", "B0087ZG7PW", "6300267865", "0800113055", "B000006N70", "B0045HCJ9E", "0782006809", "B00007JME0", "0780614097", "6301670140", "0792110269", "B000021Y6M", "6300269477", "0783235615", "6302413435", "6301798740", "0792837096", "6303854311", "B00005Q4GY", "0792107683", "0792837630", "6302800897", "6304457316", "0792835573", "6301978552", "B00000JKNL", "6303637574", "6305222754", "6302360978", "B00000JZIH", "6301797957", "6301975987", "1558800034", "6304359675", "6300271781", "630197350X", "6303364772", "6300216365", "6301800974", "0783227264"], "bought_together": ["0783221347", "6300183580"], "also_viewed": ["B0087ZG7PW", "B0045HCJ9E", "B0002HOEQ2", "B002GSXKQA", "B000A1INJE", "B000055Y0X", "B0087ZG7UW", "B001D8W7EU", "B00KMAVPW0", "B00J2R3VZI", "B008D1Q1VU", "B0045HCJHG", "B006FE83UE", "B00AEBB89C", "B003LMPKSQ", "B0045HCJQW", "B007N5YJWK", "0792839846", "B0002HOERG", "0790743213", "B000CCW2TS", "B000LP6KNU", "B000ECX0S8", "6304119046", "B00004XPPC", "B0010YSD7W", "B00AEBB97S", "B001D8W7EK", "B000ECX0O2", "6304429274", "B00I3C1T34", "6304039530", "630266232X", "0800132009", "6304039522", "B003VS0CX8", "0783235593", "B002VWNIAY", "6300183211", "B00BWJQEC6", "B0087F7VSY", "B002VWNIDG", "B00CNW9ZI6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 203666}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.18, "brand": "", "asin": "6300183513", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518BC0WC70L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rear Window [VHS]"}

{"description": "In the tradition of such obsessively driven directors as Erich von Stroheim and Werner Herzog, Francis Ford Coppola approached the production ofApocalypse Nowas if it were his own epic mission into the heart of darkness. On location in the storm-ravaged Philippines, he quite literally went mad as the project threatened to devour him in a vortex of creative despair, but from this insanity came one of the greatest films ever made. It began as a John Milius screenplay, transposing Joseph Conrad's classic story \"Heart of Darkness\" into the horrors of the Vietnam War, following a battle-weary Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) on a secret upriver mission to find and execute the renegade Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has reverted to a state of murderous and mystical insanity. The journey is fraught with danger involving wartime action on epic and intimate scales. One measure of the film's awesome visceral impact is the number of sequences, images, and lines of dialogue that have literally burned themselves into our cinematic consciousness, from the Wagnerian strike of helicopter gunships on a Vietnamese village to the brutal murder of stowaways on a peasant sampan and the unflinching fearlessness of the surfing warrior Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who speaks lovingly of \"the smell of napalm in the morning.\" Like Herzog'sAguirre: The Wrath of God, this film is the product of genius cast into a pit of hell and emerging, phoenix-like, in triumph. Coppola's obsession (effectively detailed in the riveting documentaryHearts of Darkness, directed by Coppola's wife, Eleanor) informs every scene and every frame, and the result is a film for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301115430", "630018627X", "0790701251", "6300183211", "6303686796", "6305363668", "079284646X", "6304935811", "0784011923", "6303953425", "0792836510", "6302822688", "B000003KHS", "630021639X", "6304119046", "B00003CXE6", "6302610702", "0792158261", "B000K7VHQE", "6303036570", "6303020089", "6303651488", "0800125762", "B004LWZW9W", "B00000JGEI", "0790705141", "6302360978", "6302415853", "0783107986", "B00005ATQA", "630336568X", "0790731975", "6305095566", "6300216500", "6301662954", "6302921058", "6300246965", "6300182878", "0800100832", "B00005JKEC", "6304286961", "B000062XM6", "0784011575", "630197154X", "B00004TYS8", "B00004WIDB", "6304414099", "0800116917", "6302517036", "0800199421", "6304259131", "0783202253", "6303109950", "6303313345", "B00006C7G9", "0792837312", "6302482712", "6300213986", "6303421563", "6304039549", "B000065U6Q", "B0000A36J1", "6300182770", "B00004CNR5", "6304025831", "6303422020", "0790748169", "0800132009"], "bought_together": ["6301115430", "0790701251"], "also_viewed": ["6303953425", "6305363668", "6305750750", "B00000J2KZ", "6303506291", "6303314015"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 172447}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6300214826", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EFVS37MRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Apocalypse Now [VHS]"}

{"description": "Bruce Lee wrote and directedReturn of the Dragon, his third film, a mix of hard-edged kung fu and goofy humor. Once again he plays the country boy who travels to a foreign land, in this case Italy, where his restaurant-owning cousins face trouble from the local syndicate. Their strong-arm tactics have driven customers away and now threaten the family, but Lee refuses to buckle under their pressure and takes them on in a series of impressive confrontations. The film ends with a memorable showdown with world-champion karate artist Chuck Norris in the Roman Colosseum (though much of it is staged in a rather cheap studio set), a brutal, almost inhuman battle that revels in the intense punishment taken by the combatants. Norris is one of Lee's best opponents and a marvelous physical contrast: brawny and hairy, using power and blunt karate moves while lean, wiry Lee counters with speed, gymnastic prowess, and balletic grace. The mix of comedy and kung fu comes off as camp at times, but that's hardly the reason to see the film. When Lee gets into action, whether he's taking on a gang of knife-wielding thugs or dueling Norris to the death, he becomes the total focus. Originally titledThe Way of the Dragon, this film was renamed in the wake ofEnter the Dragonto cash in on that movie's popularity.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"bought_together": ["0790735172", "6300250172"], "also_viewed": ["B004GJYRKA", "0790735172", "6300250172", "B00005OSN6", "B0041OJPIE", "6305508534", "B0015RCUR8", "B00005B1X4", "6300250156"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 385344}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.69, "brand": "", "asin": "6300250164", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YJKTD7HBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Return of the Dragon [VHS]"}

{"description": "This Mike Todd production was a star-studded, multi-million dollar extravaganza when first released in 1956. It remains enjoyable family fare, but time has somewhat dulled its shine. Still, it compares favorably to the overly long, TV mini-series starring Pierce Brosnan and Eric Idle.Elegant David Niven plays the neurotically punctual Phileas Fogg, a British gent who is spurned on by a wager to prove he can travel around the world in 80 days. He is accompanied by his valet, played with persnickety humor by Cantinflas.Nominated for several Academy Awards, this was written by John Farrow (Mia's dad) and S.J. Perelman, based on Jules Verne's 1873 classic. The fun part is the razzle-dazzle. Todd knew what he was doing with all those exotic locales and over 40 cameo appearances, including Charles Boyer, Ronald Colman, Marlene Dietrich, Jos&eacute; Greco, Peter Lorre, Buster Keaton, Frank Sinatra, and Red Skelton. A very young Shirley MacLaine was painted and dyed to play a lively Indian Princess.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304291698", "6302098424", "B000063K2R", "B00005RRG6", "6304107250", "B00000F6D1", "6302241103", "6301734734", "630150528X", "B0000022WA", "B00008MTVX", "6305282927", "6304293941", "6302824613", "6302843308", "6301670159", "0783235593", "6301718267", "6300183513"], "bought_together": ["6304291698"], "also_viewed": ["B004D45NXI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 278315}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.45, "brand": "", "asin": "6300270130", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J85YT94VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Around the World in 80 Days [VHS]"}

{"description": "Reviled by critics and embraced by the public during its initial run (1981),Porky'sis interesting to watch after all these years. What holds up about this horny coming-of-age tale is remarkable. Writer/director Bob Clark has little more than sex and practical joking on his mind, and his high school seniors from Angel Beach, Florida, rapidly move from one to the other. Clark displays a sense of timing and, perhaps rarer still, a sense of male friendship--its brutalities and its bonds--that feels right, not artificial. Surprisingly, the showcase practical jokes are still funny: the Everglades encounter with Cherry Forever, the hole in the girls' shower, and Beulah Balbricker, the humongous gym teacher. The comedic set-ups and payoffs surprisingly still work. Clark's insistence on a subplot about anti-Semitism, however, still sticks out as A MESSAGE. Kim Cattrall really got her start here (although almost no one else did) as Ms. Honeywell, a.k.a. \"Lassie.\" Clark later distanced himself from the irritatingPorky'ssequels and went on to make the wonderfulChristmas Story, the tale of a little boy who wants a BB gun for Christmas.--Keith Simanton", "related": {"bought_together": ["630240424X"], "also_viewed": ["B000O76ZNU", "B000056BSE", "B004INAKS2", "630240424X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 396986}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.24, "brand": "", "asin": "6301697286", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41AXZEWVH2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Porky's [VHS]"}
{"description": "Ranking No. 21 on the American Film Institute's list of the 100 greatest American films, this 1940 classic is a bit dated in its noble sentimentality, but it remains a luminous example of Hollywood classicism from the peerless director of mythic Americana, John Ford. Adapted by Nunnally Johnson from John Steinbeck's classic novel, the film tells a simple story about Oklahoma farmers leaving the depression-era dustbowl for the promised land of California, but it's the story's emotional resonance and theme of human perseverance that makes the movie so richly and timelessly rewarding. It's all about the humble Joad family's cross-country trek to escape the economic devastation of their ruined farmland, beginning when Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) returns from a four-year prison term to discover that his family home is empty. He's reunited with his family just as they're setting out for the westbound journey, and thus begins an odyssey of saddening losses and strengthening hopes. As Ma Joad, Oscar-winner Jane Darwell is the embodiment of one of America's greatest social tragedies and the \"Okie\" spirit of pressing forward against all odds (as she says, \"because we're the people\"). A documentary-styled production for which Ford and cinematographer Gregg Toland demanded painstaking authenticity,The Grapes of Wrathis much more than a classy, old-fashioned history lesson. With dialogue and scenes that rank among the most moving and memorable ever filmed, it's a classic among classics--simply put, one of the finest films ever made.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783222955", "6301797957", "6301976983", "6301964268", "6301562178", "6304935811", "1558807780", "6302656125", "6305081832", "0800132009", "6302360978", "6304119038", "6302226899", "0769403468", "6302091632", "0800113055", "6300181111", "6301976398", "6301586026", "6303393985", "6304039522", "630491010X", "6302816416", "6301802012", "6304071876", "6300268799", "0783235593", "6301966465", "630266232X", "B00005NQGQ", "6302503515", "6303364772", "6300182304", "6301798708", "6301734734", "6303560040", "B000003U12", "B0000068EE", "B00004RGUU", "6304028385", "6300181472", "6300267865", "6301973232", "B000BWIZTU", "6300216039", "B00000FZCU", "6301586042", "6302952581", "6302227127", "630248443X", "6300181340", "0783221347", "6300215962", "6302909023", "6302041090", "6302526167", "0792837916", "B00000F3QZ", "6301661850", "6302130379", "0792107128", "6302700949", "B000007PI4", "6302800897", "6303383009", "0792106989", "6300267970", "6300181154", "B00000F14D", "B00004WZR1", "630280096X", "1558035745", "6300215601", "6300215741", "6300215733", "0792107683", "6303696678", "0792108280", "6305718792"], "bought_together": ["0783222955"], "also_viewed": ["0790743531", "1558807780", "6304539258", "0783216084", "6303402070", "6304429274", "6301976983", "6305123616", "0792839846"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 144842}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.36, "brand": "Studio Classic", "asin": "6301797906", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z8A6KK0BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Grapes of Wrath  [VHS]"}

Angry townspeople form a posse, find suspects, and, without waiting for a trial, summarily hang them in an expression of biblically tinged frontier justice. But the one cowboy who tried to turn the mob aside ultimately proves that they executed innocent men. Made in 1943, the film features stunning black-and-white cinematography and a solid dramatic sense about what a deadly combination ignorance and self-righteousness can be. Fonda made this film betweenThe Grapes of WrathandMy Darling Clementine, at a point when he was at the peak of his powers as a young actor.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301798759"], "bought_together": ["6301798759"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 334605}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6301798201", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51W5ECYPB2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ox Bow Incident [VHS]"}

{"description": "This low-budget crime thriller has the feel of a major blockbuster and owes its roots to the hard-edged crime movies of the 1930s. Christopher Walken stars as a drug kingpin who is released from prison and vows to use his position and influence--and criminal enterprise--for charitable means. But a core group of New York cops are all over him and his gang, determined to go to war, whatever the cost, to bring him down. Eventually his empire--headquartered at, of all places, Donald Trump's Plaza Hotel--crumbles under the weight of double-crossing and a body count of open warfare with the cops. This is one of the most stylish films of the last decade, with a strong supporting cast (including Lawrence Fishburne, Wesley Snipes, and David Caruso) and some truly enthralling set pieces, including a stunning car chase and gunfight across a rain-soaked Queensboro Bridge. The film's tongue-in-cheek, over-the-top style offsets its nihilism; and its riveting visuals will have audiences hooked from beginning to end.--Robert Lane", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 567329}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "King of New York [VHS]", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302256615", "6303486746", "B00003G1FZ", "6300182916", "6300183211"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41GJHSD113L._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "6301901266"}

(The other characters can't see William Hurt in all this, of course.) The unbelievably convoluted plot has Mr. Brooks confronted by a blackmailer (comedian Dane Cook) who has a surprising twist on things, and trailed by a cop (Demi Moore) who comes equipped with her own set of professional and marital woes. As if that weren't enough, when Brooks's daughter (Danielle Panabaker) comes home, it becomes clear that some traits run in the family.The scenes with Costner and Hurt are the best stuff in the film, even if director Bruce Evans can't figure out how to play fair visualizing their presence to others.

{"description": "Master filmmaker Bernardo Bertolucci applies his considerable talent to this haunting adaptation of the Paul Bowles novel. John Malkovich and Debra Winger play Port and Kit Moresby, characters loosely based on Bowles and his wife Jane, who flee New York for North Africa, where they hope to find mystical truths that will reignite the spark of their marriage. But instead they lose their moral bearings (with help from a friend, played by Campbell Scott, who has an affair with Kit) while traveling deeper and deeper into the Sahara. Before long, what started as a vacation at exotic lodgings has descended into a tour of hell, as they stumble farther and farther into an unknowable spiritual territory. Though long and at times slow-moving, the film features marvelously nuanced acting by Malkovich and Winger and visionary filmmaking that makes the landscape at once picturesque and threatening.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["630427081X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 365555}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.84, "brand": "", "asin": "630200053X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Q7FVS96QL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Sheltering Sky [VHS]"}
{"description": "F.W. Murnau changed the name and ghastly appearance of his villain, but this unauthorized version of Bram Stoker'sDraculacouldn't fool the Stoker estate, and it became the center of a lawsuit that almost resulted in its complete destruction. Thankfully this masterpiece survives (though in a somewhat altered form), for despite its liberties with the novel, this 1921 horror classic remains the most beautiful and resonant interpretation of Stoker. Though the plot remains essentially the same--naive real-estate clerk Thomas (Gustav von Wangenheim) is sent abroad to finalize a sale with the nocturnal Count Orlock (the hideous-looking Max Schreck), who imprisons Thomas and travels to England to claim Thomas's beautiful young wife, Ellen (Greta Schroder), as his own--the visual realization creates a very different story. Schreck plays the vampire as a grotesque demon, with his claw-like hands, bald head and sharp, bat-like ears, and he rises from his coffin with an supernatural stiffness, like a tent pole pulled upright. When the eerily empty ghost ship carrying his coffin arrives in Thomas's home port, a river of rats pours out and spreads through the town like a plague. Perhaps the most noticeable changes from the novel are the absence of Van Helsing and the richer realization of Ellen, the would-be victim, whose innate sensibility and solemn spirituality give her a spooky connection with the vampire. With his stark, symbol-laden visual scheme and sacrificial conclusion, Murnau creates a more mythic tale than any subsequent adaptation of Stoker's novel.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000067JAW", "6300183084", "6303626424", "6300183092"], "also_viewed": ["630526323X", "B00HRUQ8X4"]}, "price": 24.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 311149}, "asin": "6302194296", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VWHHY3ZJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Nosferatu [VHS]"}

{"description": "William Friedkin's classicpolicierwas propelled to box-office glory, and a fistful of Oscars, in 1972 by its pedal-to-the-metal filmmaking and fashionably cynical attitude toward law enforcement. Gene Hackman's Popeye Doyle, a brutally pushy New York City narcotics detective, is a dauntless crime fighter and Vietnam-era \"pig,\" a reckless vulgarian whose antics get innocent people killed. Loosely based upon an actual investigation that led to what was then the biggest heroin seizure in U.S. history, the picture traces the efforts of Doyle and his partner (Roy Scheider) to close the pipeline pumping Middle Eastern smack into the States through the French port of Marseilles. (The actual French Connection cops, Eddie Egan and Sonny Grosso, make cameo appearances.) It was widely recognized at the time that Friedkin had lifted a lot of his high-strung technique from the Costa-Gavras thrillersThe Sleeping Car MurdersandZ--he even imported one of Costa-Gavras's favorite thugs, Marcel Bozzuffi, to play the Euro-trash hit man plugged by Doyle in an elevated train station. There was an impressive official sequel in 1975,French Connection II, directed by John Frankenheimer, which took Popeye to the south of France and got him hooked on horse. A couple of semi-official spinoffs followed,The Seven-Ups, which elevated Scheider to the leading role, andBadge 373, with Robert Duvall stepping in as the pugnacious flatfoot.--David Chute", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000003KDG", "6300214567", "6300216500", "0790738139", "6305261296", "630442972X", "630407185X", "0790734079", "0790733897", "0790743531", "1558807780", "630321245X", "6300247384", "6301965701", "0792837916", "0800100832", "6304429274", "6300181340", "6300213900", "6302799163", "6303212263", "6302909023", "B00008R9K9", "B000007PI9", "0766202771", "B00005A1VH"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 82875}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6302238331", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K7T6QP3QL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The French Connection [VHS]"}

{"description": "Made in 1928 while he was in the middle of a painful divorce case, Charlie Chaplin'sThe Circuswas so associated with bad memories for its maker that he refused even to mention it in his 1964 autobiography. Consequently, it has enjoyed less of a reputation than such films asThe Gold Rush(1925) andCity Lights(1931). However, while it's not quite in their league,The Circusundoubtedly deserves to be rescued from relative obscurity.Here, Chaplin's Tramp is taken on as a clown at the circus, having been chased into the big tent by a policeman wrongly suspected of theft and wowing the audience with his pratfalls. He falls in love with the ill-treated ringmaster's daughter (Merna Kennedy) but is swiftly rivaled by a new addition to the circus, a handsome tightrope walker. To try to win back her affections, the Tramp himself attempts the same act, culminating in the best sequence of the film, when he is assailed by monkeys as he totters amateurishly and precariously along a rope suspended high in the tent. AlthoughThe Circusis marred by the rather hackneyed and (even in 1928) stale melodramatic device of the cruel father and imploring daughter, it scores high on its slapstick content, with routines involving a hall of mirrors and a mishap with a magician's equipment demonstrating Chaplin's dazzling ability to choreograph apparently improvised mayhem.--David Stubbs", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302561817", "6302561841", "6302561949"], "bought_together": ["6302561841"], "also_viewed": ["6302561841"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 368812}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.18, "brand": "", "asin": "6302561825", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RPZY6VRKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Circus /A Day's Pleasure [VHS]"}

{"description": "When they say they don't make 'em like they used to, they're talking  about 20th Century Fox's exhilaratingThe Mark of Zorro, starring Tyrone Power as the caped one, Linda Darnell as his love interest, and Basil Rathbone at his scurrilous best as Zorro's nemesis. More textured than the1920 originalwith Douglas Fairbanks, this 1940 version has Don Diego/Zorro (Powers) returning from Madrid to defend his father and rally the caballeros (noblemen) against Los Angeles's corrupt new governor (J. Edward Bromberg), intent on taxing the peons to death.If this all sounds like an Old California redo of the classicAdventures of Robin Hood, that's because it is. Powers has a field day as Don Diego, the \"fancy clown\" betrothed to the governor's niece, Lolita (Darnell). Don Diego the effete snob performs silly parlor tricks, peers through pince-nez, and yawns disdainfully at one and all. Power's cowardly alter ego is so believable, his transformation to masked superhero becomes all the more thrilling. Imagine Captain Pasquale's (Rathbone) shock when, in the film's brilliantly choreographed showdown, this annoying fop turns out to be a world-class swordsman.Director Rouben Mamoulian, known for great period melodramas, does a skillful job of alternating garrison intrigue with big action scenes, including a nighttime ride that climaxes with Zorro on horseback leaping off a bridge. In the romantic highlight, Lolita confides her innermost desires to a suspiciously worldly friar. The first-rate supporting cast includes Gale Sondergaard as the governor's treacherous wife and the frog-voiced Eugene Pallette (Friar Tuck inThe Adventures of Robin Hood) as a padre in cahoots with the masked one. Technically, this retelling rates an unqualified \"Wow!\" The cinematography, obviously influenced by Goya, makes full use of chiaroscuro shadows, and Alfred Newman's Latin-flavored score is irresistibly rousing and romantic.--Glenn Lovell", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303943004", "B000NTPG66", "B00407PNWO", "6300181111", "0800100832", "6302413435", "6302909023", "6303562248", "6301798503", "6303039693", "0792844564", "6302224489", "6301967410", "6301969561", "6301734734", "6301965701", "0790743213", "1558807780", "6303393985", "6303102506", "6301971426", "6300215741", "6301798708", "6300269795", "630266232X", "6300181472", "0782006779", "6303120474", "0800132009", "6305012792", "6302226899", "0800113055", "0790733935", "6300215644", "6301976207", "6301797906", "6302801133", "B00005A1VH", "6300275213", "B00004TX24", "B0000040EO", "6301977149", "6302305942", "6302800897", "630442972X", "6300267970", "6301978536", "B000007PI9", "B00004R67T", "6302415853"], "bought_together": ["B00407PNWO"], "also_viewed": ["B0012VCMSY", "B008VR7U0M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 333985}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6302700949", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KYMS6Q3QL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Mark Of Zorro [VHS]"}

The best running joke finds a concierge (Tim Curry) at the swank hotel where Culkin is staying trying and failing to prove that the boy is on his own.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302091632", "6304932553", "B0000A02WC", "0767825411", "B0000048S1", "B00000490M", "B00000JGEI", "6300214753", "0784011923", "6300269639", "6302824729", "6301570723", "630442972X", "6303344224", "6300183181", "6305814694", "B00005B6ND", "0783216084", "0790731436", "B000059XY5", "6300213668", "6300263673", "6302968143", "6303049079", "6303269966", "B00008N6NQ", "079070546X", "B00006G8LB", "6303442447", "6303506291", "B00008X5J8", "080013558X", "0788812408", "6304500831", "6300214370", "6301827732", "6303540082", "6304089767", "0790742322", "6302374189", "6301792734", "6304209266", "6303446590", "6302526574", "6304400551", "6303314015", "630018403X", "6300183467", "6303236863", "B00000JKNP", "0780607287", "0783223234", "6301666569", "B00008DZ83", "B0000BWVBD", "6304118937", "6302518393", "6302914469", "6303347657", "0783200544", "6300215814", "6300214710", "6303861733", "6301966988", "B00023BLXA", "6301392892", "B000R3KOWE", "B00004TJTQ", "6303929680", "B00005RJ3A", "6303394345", "6303675220", "B0002F6BQU", "B0009YWTHY", "6303696929", "0790741628", "B00329TVQA", "6300213730", "6304675348", "B000006FYP", "6303168957", "B00000G09Q", "6304416415", "B000059XVO", "0800196767", "6303106641", "B00000JKNL", "0783221800", "630362572X", "B000055YW4", "6305907102", "6304340699", "B000003KDD", "0790705141", "6302877881", "6302593085", "B00004RFHF", "B00000F8J1", "6303182615"], "bought_together": ["6302091632", "6304932553"], "also_viewed": ["6302091632", "6304932553", "6302581907", "B00008N6NQ", "B00003CX7L", "6303314015", "6304089767", "6302787068", "0788812408", "6303049079", "B00004SVV9", "0788805533", "B00003CXI0", "B00005JKDQ", "6304500831", "B00005JMQY", "6305229449", "B0002F6BQU", "6302320402", "B004EPZ034", "6302453356", "B001DDBD5E", "B00000I7Q3", "6303212379", "B004047XWU", "B000640WHG", "B00006CXK5", "B00005LOUS", "6300213005", "0788812807", "B00003CXI1", "B00005LOUP", "B001ELWMHI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 234332}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.94, "brand": "", "asin": "6302765536", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CVFY614VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Home Alone 2 - Lost in New York [VHS]"}

{"description": "Brian Henson directs his late father's creations in the Charles Dickens classic, the best known (and most oft-filmed) Christmas story of all time. Michael Caine plays the old miser Scrooge with Kermit as his long-suffering but ever-hopeful employee Bob Cratchit, Miss Piggy as Cratchit's wife, and a host of Muppets (including the Great Gonzo as an unlikely Charles Dickens) taking other primary roles in this bright, playful adaptation of the somber tale. Or at least it starts brightly enough--the anarchic humor soon settles into mirthful memories and a sense of melancholy as the ghosts of Christmas past, present, and future take Scrooge on a journey of his lonely, wasted life. Michael Caine makes a wonderful Scrooge, delightfully rediscovering the meaning of life as fantastic creations from Henson's Creature Shop (developed specially for this film) take the reins as the three ghosts. While the odd mix of offbeat humor and somber drama undercuts the power of Dickens's drama, this kid-friendly retelling makes an excellent family drama that adults and children alike can enjoy.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304089627", "6302642485", "6302642493", "6302787068", "6303232221", "B0000AM6I0", "6304089767", "B00000IQBQ", "6302798744", "6301390725", "6303122647", "0767815963", "6302642507", "6302794404", "6304500831", "B00000JYLP", "155890641X", "6302320402", "6300274195", "B003XURDCC", "6302973791", "6300274268", "B00005JKX3", "0788812807", "0788812408", "B002DLB15W", "6302794315", "B00003ETPU", "6302526574", "6304015127", "6302961572", "6302642574", "B00000J2JA", "6302642566", "B00000ICHA", "B000ATQYTW", "B00016JF2W", "B00000JKNP", "0788805533", "6303983812", "6303123244", "6300274608", "6304400551", "6302091632", "6303442447", "6304209266", "B0009YWTHY", "6304401132", "6302794382", "0788802194", "0788810448", "B00006953H", "6304100507", "6300215695", "1558906150", "6303215734", "B000ATQYTC", "0788806270", "B00000JS61", "6304978286", "6303921167", "B00000J2JC", "B00029LO18", "B000003KLW", "6302642248", "6304400888", "6302178924", "B005BYBZPY", "6302794358", "B000063V8N", "B00005BCJR", "B00004UGAU", "630279434X", "6302794250", "B000BD18HK", "157330574X", "6302794412", "6304293968", "6304162286", "6302581907", "0780630084", "B00000F8J1", "B00003CXJ3", "6302090873", "B00008X5J8", "B00001YX9H", "6303824358", "B0002OXUWO", "6304089449", "6303953832", "6303925235", "6302794447", "B0002SDDR2", "B0001A79G2", "6303036953", "B000035Z4W", "6303441408", "6303614493"], "bought_together": ["6304089627", "6302642485"], "also_viewed": ["6304089627", "6302642485", "6303314015", "6302642493", "B000035Z2S", "6300274195", "6303232221", "6304089767", "B0000AM6I0", "6303122647", "0788811002", "0788812408", "6304290888", "6302426200", "6303929338", "6305319138", "B00004R99N", "6302961572", "0788812807", "6304401736", "6302484359", "B00000ICHA", "B00000JYLP", "0788802194", "B00000J2JA", "6305229449", "155890641X", "6303036813", "B00005JKDQ", "6302178924", "6304500831", "0788805533", "6304400551", "B000009CTR", "6303983812", "6302320402", "0767815963", "6304400381", "6300275310", "6304209266", "6303109918", "078880720X", "6302642248", "6300276880", "B0007KTBIU", "6302787068", "B00003CX7L", "6304089201", "6302526574", "6303168957", "B00003CXHR", "B00006AULB", "B00005RRG5", "B00004REYY", "B00000F8J1", "078881172X", "0788806270", "6303534422", "6304022166"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 213182}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.94, "brand": "", "asin": "6302794331", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J8AERSFQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Muppet Christmas Carol  [VHS]"}

Lynch's thoughts seem to be everywhere, and he expects the audience to keep up with a story that seems more a collection of avant-garde whims than a coherent vision with the intuitive brilliance of hisBlue Velvet.

Director Henry Hathaway (whoseKiss of Deathstarted the trend) stages the action on the actual Chicago locations, providing a fascinating documentary record of an underfilmed metropolis (the convict's mother is a washerwoman at the Wrigley Building), and leads his cast to appropriately restrained, naturalistic performances.

What Stewart doesn't know is that Hewlitt is the girlfriend of his commanding officer, Lt. Commander Dewey Connors (Dana Andrews). After a dangerous mission is completed, Stewart asks Hewlitt to marry him, and she accepts. Further complications develop when both officers set off together on a dangerous mission to destroy a Nazi base--after Connors discovers that his subordinate has been pursuing his women.

{"description": "David Lean focused all his talent as an epic-maker on Boris Pasternak's sweeping novel about a doctor-poet in revolutionary Russia. The results may sometimes veer toward soap opera, especially with the screen frequently filled with adoring close-ups of Omar Sharif and Julie Christie, but Lean's gift for cramming the screen with spectacle is not to be denied. The streets of Moscow, the snowy steppes of Russia, the house in the country taken over by ice; these are re-created with Lean's unerring sense of grandness. The movie is so lush and so long that it becomes an irresistible wallow, even when logic suffers--likeGone with the Windbefore it andTitanicafter. Sharif, who achieved stardom in Lean's previous film,Lawrence of Arabia, mostly looks noble, but the supporting cast is spiky: Rod Steiger as a fat-cat monster, Tom Courtenay as a self-righteous revolutionary, and Klaus Kinski and Alec Guinness in smaller roles. Geraldine Chaplin, in her adult debut, plays the doctor's compliant wife. Robert Bolt's screenplay won one of the film's five Oscars&reg;, with another going to perhaps the most immediately recognizable element of the movie: Maurice Jarre's romantic music, with its hugely popular \"Lara's Theme\" weaving in and out of a swooning score.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["0800116917", "6305123616", "0800132009", "6300185095", "0792839846", "B0000048ZL", "B00000F6D1", "B0000048YM", "B000GG4Y32", "6302098424", "B0000068ZQ", "6304400551", "6303494390", "6303057225", "B00006ADD5", "6301965701", "0790743213", "6301797957", "6303854311", "B00000FZCU", "0792116887", "B00004RGUU", "6300215539", "6303562248", "6300268748", "6302360978", "6303029027", "6302415853", "6300216721", "630018224X", "6302909023", "6302842263", "6300268799", "B00005Q4GY", "6301964012", "B00004TYS8", "6300216195", "6303402348", "6300215814", "0800199421", "6300246965", "6304039522", "0783226152", "6301607929", "6302226899", "6304005989", "0783235593", "0790751089", "630442972X", "B000006N70", "6300216012", "0790752395", "6301969413", "0792841026", "6303686745", "630196733X", "6300216748", "6302424909", "0783221347", "6304214502", "B00000IO4G"], "bought_together": ["0800116917", "0800132009"], "also_viewed": ["B009L2EW98", "0792151712", "0800116917", "0790743159", "6304239149", "6301792769", "6304089767", "155890641X", "6301628454", "6301792734", "B00000K3AN"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 381443}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6303599109", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SZ5GR64CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Doctor Zhivago - 30th Anniversary Edition [VHS]"}

Never mind that this has little to do with Hawthorne's magnificent, protofeminist book, which is a million times more relevant today than this film could ever be.

{"description": "An absolutely guileless piece of anti-nuclear agitprop,Invisible Invaders' unwavering single-mindedness and artful, bargain-basement effects have contributed to its deserved reputation as a early sci-fi classic. Essentially a didactic play of ideas--closer to Shaw than Spielberg--the story line follows a reluctant nuclear scientist (played with genuine sensitivity by Philip Tonge) whose conscience forces him out of the military-industrial complex. When a race of invisible aliens declares its intention to destroy Earth, Tonge must scramble to find their weakness. Veteran B-movie hunk John Agar lends support as a courageous army major who takes charge of the experimentation, and, in the process, supplies the film with its only shred of a subplot by romancing the scientist's daughter (spunky Jean Byron). Substantial newsreel footage and seemingly unrelated canned shots add to the creepy atmosphere, and the film's one real special effect--concentric circles representing sound waves--proves quite effective in its pure minimalism. Shot, apparently, on a budget of pocket change and bounced credit- union checks,Invisible Invadersstands as an inspiration to cash-poor indie filmmakers everywhere, and to anybody who understands that the true measure of a science-fiction narrative is not the force of its explosions, but of its ideas.--Miles Bethany", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 504468}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.15, "brand": "", "asin": "6304056850", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N6G7X92AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Invisible Invaders [VHS]"}

{"description": "Vincent Price gives an atypically restrained performance as the sole survivor of a worldwide plague that revives its victims as bloodthirsty vampires. During the day, he canvasses his abandoned hometown, tracking down and stalking his former friends and neighbors, always making sure to return before nightfall, when the dead rise to assault his fortified house. Hope arrives in the form of an apparently normal young woman (Franca Bettoia), but her agenda proves to be even more sinister than that of the vampires.Based on the 1954 novel by coscripter Matheson (whose displeasure with the final product spurred the use of a pseudonym), this Italian-made production is best known for its influence on George Romero'sNight of the Living Dead. The similarities between the two films go beyond the presence of shuffling zombies and housebound heroes; both feature taboo-breaking scenes of interfamilial murder, and both end on bleak, dystopian notes. WhileThe Last Man on Earthlacks the political and darkly satirical shadings (and graphic gore) that makeNight of the Living Deada more memorable experience, the combination of Bava-esque Gothic atmosphere and bleak, documentary-style camerawork by directors Ragona and Salkow (the brother of Price's agent Lester Salkow) lend themselves to moments of pure frisson that compare laudably to Romero's film.  Matheson's novel also provided the source material for the awkward 1971 Charlton Heston vehicleThe Omega Man. A planned third version, helmed by Ridley Scott and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, was shut down in its earliest stages due to skyrocketing budget costs.--Paul Gaita", "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 751347}, "asin": "6304277385", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/7114X6M9A7L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Last Man on Earth [VHS]"}

{"description": "Disney's 1959 animated effort was the studio's most ambitious to date, a widescreen spectacle boasting a gorgeous waltz-filled score adapting Tchaikovsky. In the 14th century, the malevolent Maleficent (not dissimilar to the wicked Queen in Disney'sSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs) taunts a king that his infant Aurora will fatally prick her finger on a spinning wheel before sundown on her 16th birthday. This, of course, would deny her a happily-ever-after with her true love. Things almost but not quite turn out that way, thanks to the assistance of some bubbly, bumbling fairies named Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather. It's not really all that much about the title character--how interesting can someone in the middle of a long nap be, anyway? Instead, those fairies carry the day, as well as, of course, good Prince Phillip, whose battle with the malevolent Maleficent in the guise of a dragon has been co-opted by any number of animated films since. See it in its original glory here. And Malificent's castle, filled with warthogs and demonic imps in a macabre dance celebrating their evil ways, manages a certain creepy grandeur.--David Kronke", "related": {"also_bought": ["155890641X", "0788802194", "0788812408", "6302526574", "0788806270", "0788812807", "078881172X", "6302642248", "6302787068", "6302320402", "6304500831", "6303314015", "6300274268", "B000035Z2S", "6300274195", "0788805843", "6305229449", "0788803743", "6302961572", "6302178924", "6304290888", "6303983812", "6300275310", "6305940932", "B0000AQZYM", "6304089767", "6305319138", "0788805533", "6304400551", "6304978286", "6304100507", "6302158095", "B00005JKDQ", "6305326940", "6304089201", "6303929338", "6304501153", "6303534422", "B00003CXQX", "6303036813", "B00005T7H6", "6301390725", "B00003CX7L", "6304873441", "B0000524CZ", "B00000ICHA", "B00004R99N", "6304400225", "B00004R99I", "B0009SUS4Q", "6302426200", "6300274608", "0788812440", "6303122647", "B0000E32WB", "0788811002", "0788810634", "B00000JS61", "B00005RDVV", "6303939015", "B00016JF2W", "B00005RDWC", "0790748266", "B000JBWWRO", "6304117752", "1558906150", "B00003CXHR", "B000035Z46", "6303486894", "0788812181", "6303392350", "B003H9M1Q2", "6303148387", "6302484359", "1558901892", "B00005JL95", "B00003CXQ6", "6301948106", "6305177473", "0788809806", "B00007AJLB", "B00003CWPW", "6305942285", "B000B8I8T6", "B00335EQ0E", "6301991311", "B0002YLCHE", "630460016X", "0788810448", "B00004REYY", "B003ZHVJGO", "B000063V8N", "078880720X", "B00004R99O", "B00005JKX3", "6300276554", "1558906630", "B000009CTR", "B00005RRG3"], "bought_together": ["155890641X", "0788802194"], "also_viewed": ["155890641X", "0788802194", "6302526574", "0788806270", "078881172X", "0788812408", "6300274268", "6302787068", "6304500831", "0788812807", "6302320402", "6303314015", "0788805843", "6302642248", "6302178924", "6302961572", "6305319138", "6303983812", "6300274195", "6305229449", "B000035Z2S", "6304089767", "B0000AQZYM", "6304978286", "0788805533", "6303929338", "6304290888", "6305940932", "6304400551", "6303534422", "6300275310", "6304100507", "6304089201", "6302158095", "B00005JKDQ", "B001DXF9FE", "B00003CXCQ", "B0007KTBIU", "6305326940", "B00004R99N", "6304501153", "6304400225", "6302426200", "6303036813", "B00003CXQX", "6300274608", "B0000E32WB", "B00003CXHR", "B00000ICHA", "0788811002", "B00005JL95", "B003ZHVJGO", "B00005RDVV", "B0000022WA", "0788812440", "1558906150", "B00003CX7L", "B0000524CZ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 50797}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.49, "brand": "Walt Disney Home Video", "asin": "6304401132", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y7WQST4JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sleeping Beauty (Fully Restored Limited Edition) (Walt Disney's Masterpiece)  [VHS]"}

It solidified Ford as a major director and established Wayne as a charismatic screen presence.

{"description": "Catherine Deneuve and David Bowie are rich, beautiful, and oh-so chic as denizens of the night. Dressed in sleek outfits and stylish sunglasses, they haunt rock & roll clubs on the prowl for young blood, whom they bring home to their impossibly luxurious mansion for a late-night snack.  Being a vampire never looked more sexy, but there's a price: Bowie starts to age so fast he wrinkles up in the waiting room of a doctor's (Susan Sarandon) office. The agelessly elegant Deneuve, evoking Delphine Seyrig's Countess Bathory fromDaughters of Darkness, is perfectly cast as a millenniums-old bloodsucker who seeks a new mate in Sarandon and seduces her in a sunlight-bathed afternoon of smooth, silky sex. Tony Scott's (Ridley's brother) directorial debut, adapted from the Whitley Strieber novel, revises the vampire myth with Egyptian inflections and removes all references to garlic and crosses and wooden stakes--these bloodsuckers can even walk around in the daylight--but the ties between blood and sex are as strong as ever. Scott's background as an award-winning commercial director is evident in every richly textured frame and his densely interwoven editing, but the moody atmosphere comes at the expense of dramatic urgency. At times the film is so languid it becomes mired in its hazy, impeccably designed visual style. In its own way,The Hungeris the perfect vampire film for the '80s, all poise and attitude and surface beauty. Sarandon talks candidly about the film in the documentaryThe Celluloid Closet.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000I1GO"], "bought_together": ["B00000I1GO"], "also_viewed": ["6302491908"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 278584}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6304509103", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51793HKSJ8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hunger [VHS]"}

{"description": "Just awful enough to qualify as someone's guilty pleasure, this convoluted thriller was supposed to cash in on the supposedly sexy teaming of Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone (then hot from her ample exposure inBasic Instinct), but their naked groping in a shower provides one of the film's unintentionally funny highlights. Ray Quick (Stallone) is a former CIA bomb expert whose former colleague (James Woods) is now in cahoots with a Miami drug cartel led by kingpin Joe Leon (Rod Steiger), who chews the scenery while his son Tomas (Eric Roberts) proceeds with a greedy hidden agenda. May Munro (Stone) hires Quick to kill off Roberts.The Specialist, featuring lots of explosions and redeemed by a dandy role for James Woods, is best suited for ardent Stallone and Stone fans.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0045HCJ5S", "B00004STDN", "B0045HCJG2", "0783226934", "6304602944", "B000MEYKEG", "B0045HCJGC", "B004SIP6WW", "B000EQ5SRK", "B000E5N684", "B000056PNL", "1558908846", "B00441GYY2", "B001B3LIOC", "6305308837", "0790730979", "B000QXDCLU", "B00003CXTM", "B000QUCRB4", "B00315462E", "B0045HCJFS", "B0001FGBWK", "B00015YVDG", "B002GHHHME", "B0002J58HO", "B00H1RMWYW", "B00026ZG10", "B000E0WJLE", "6305645477", "B0006GANOQ", "B000BMY2N8", "B002GHHHH4", "0767817710", "6305133409", "B000ENC5YW", "B000FS9UKI", "0783226888", "076780970X", "0767807588", "B0000VV5BM", "B00005JKIP", "B003AWRMA6", "0790732149", "B002AT8KA6", "B00008UALG", "B000FI8MPW", "6304711891", "B000B8GT92", "0783227892", "B000R348QW", "B002AS466O", "B0002S94CK", "B00441GYXI", "B00AEFYUQQ", "0790736411", "B000CEV3M8", "B00003CY0V", "B00000JDIQ", "B00008K76V", "B00AEFXKZ8", "B001KRVLCI", "B000055Y0Y", "B0050MB5NO", "6304712898", "B00005Y1UX", "0767802519", "B00006L92K", "B000OT6V0K", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B00JU949TK", "B0015XHP2C", "B0000AZT79", "6304806434", "079073639X", "B0045HCIWW", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B00AEBB9UK", "B00BTYOYG2", "B0004Z33G4", "B000K7UBSO", "B000FO0AA6", "B00000I1JZ", "B0006GAOGS", "6305428484", "B0006IIPL2", "0767803434", "0792835727", "B0000542CD", "B00JA3RVG4", "B00AIBZMD6", "B003ASLJNQ", "B00009WVSL", "B00BLF9FOK", "B00AEFXYJA", "6305657947", "B00008K76W", "B002GHHHJC", "B00004Z1FX", "0792159659", "B0000AMJEK"], "bought_together": ["B0045HCJ5S", "B00004STDN"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000A2W4QG", "B000U1ZV62", "B0045HCJ5S", "B00004STDN"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 25941}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.59, "brand": "STALLONE,SYLVESTER", "asin": "6304779631", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JWAY6YXVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Specialist"}

{"description": "An economic crisis brings unemployed Nada (Roddy Piper) to L.A. in search of work.  What he finds instead is that the ruling elite of the world are aliens in disguise, their aim being to keep humans in a state of mindless consumerism.  His discovery comes when he dons a pair of special sunglasses made by a resistance group and sees for the first time reality unadorned.  Billboards, store signs, magazine covers--all bear subliminal messages to OBEY, to CONSUME, to have NO INDEPENDENT THOUGHT.  Money itself says THIS IS YOUR GOD. But worst of all, with these glasses you see which of us are really hideous, bug-eyed aliens.  The conceptual breakthrough is hilarious while keeping its roots in darker matters.  Although some fault the film for settling into its action plot, the ending has a great payoff. And the direction by John Carpenter is handled with superb workmanlike aplomb. One unforgettable set piece has Piper in a back-alley fistfight with a friend who won't put on the glasses that goes on and on, and just when you think it's over it goes another round. One of the most subversive films ever made in Hollywood,They Livewas released on the eve of the 1988 elections.  The first TV ads had two hideous alien politicians debating, then one accusing the other of being \"No John Kennedy!\"--Jim Gay", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004Y87O", "B0002CHK1S", "B0000AOX0A", "B000AM6OQ2", "B000QUCQX8", "B005LS4MQY", "B0016I0AJG", "B00AKGG828", "B00AEFYDM2", "B008CYDD7I", "0783227434", "B000CNESU8", "B0002DB5PO", "B00023P4SS", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B00008974J", "0783225903", "0790731932", "B000A7Q1UQ", "B00FD81VQQ", "078062856X", "B00005K3O4", "B00005N5RM", "B0024FADD8", "B0024FAG44", "B000BR9S96", "B002E2QH7W", "0783241895", "B0053TWW36", "0783228457", "B000096FVG", "B002HML6YI", "B0053TWW9K", "B003O7I6L6", "B00AEFXR8I", "0767821629", "B00441GZ14", "B0045HCJKS", "B0001Z37HM", "6304936532", "0790729342", "B00005JOJE", "B0009X768W", "B0000AOX09", "B00006FDCD", "B000LC4Z7Q", "B00009YXHN", "B0000A08LF", "B0013LL2Z2", "B007XF0W3K", "B0010X73ZG", "B00005JL78", "B000059PP6", "B002NZK5SM", "B000FS9FCG", "B005FQ2H8W", "0792838300", "B000068IEV", "B00005PJ6M", "B000JMK6LW", "B003O7I6SE", "B00JQYV0B4", "B008DVJOQ4", "B0006210ZG", "B000UAFDR0", "B000PFUAP0", "B002NN7EY2", "0955997313", "B003UGLCIA", "B00005AVS9", "B000P0J0AQ", "B001J710Y8", "B000IJ7A5Q", "B00000JSJC", "B000OVLBHG", "B00000IREA", "6305645574", "B002I41KNC", "B00005N5S5", "B00005A3KS", "B0001FVDQ4", "B00CDV4RS0", "B0091C22AY", "B000P0J0BU", "B001PYD0PC", "6305065551", "B000MDFTHE", "B000WC3864", "157362408X", "B007FQXEXW", "B0007R4TR6", "B00008MTVY", "B0052DP1RC", "B00AEBB91E", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B005CVFZ66", "0800195175", "B001ECDVKE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0024FADBA", "B00004Y87O", "B000QUCQX8", "B0002CHK1S"]}, "price": 9.74, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 133661}, "asin": "6305077754", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51242QSSA4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "They Live"}
{"description": "Jules Dassin's brooding, brutal drama about a prison wound to the  breaking point by a sadistic captain of the guards is a classic film noir as well  as one of the greatest prison films ever made. Burt Lancaster (in only his third film but already commanding the screen like a pro) is the savvy prison veteran whose clashes with Hume Cronyn (the ambitious guard with a god complex) land him first in solitary then in the claustrophobic drain pipe, a muddy, airless work detail that slowly kills every man assigned to it. With the help of his cellmate buddies and former gangland boss Charles Bickford he hatches a plan to break out, but Cronyn has his own plans for the unbreakable prisoner. Dassin's oppressive prison is thick with atmosphere: cavernous buildings and halls that echo with the footsteps of inmates and the clanking of bars, overcrowded cells that seem to close in on the men, a busy machine shop where the film's most memorable scene takes place--the ruthless assassination of a stoolie in a pounding metal press. Cinematographer William Daniels, a master of Hollywood's soft-focus glamour, creates a harsh, hard-edged look for the film, softened only by looming shadows. A sense of doom hovers over everything, culminating in an explosive finale, but the barbaric, brutish violence hangs in the air long after the film is over.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783217528", "0792837371", "6301973410"]}, "price": 23.94, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 463456}, "asin": "6305226156", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/217E31PPRKL.jpg", "title": "Brute Force [VHS]"}

{"description": "A Soviet sensation upon its heavily publicized release in 1924,Aelita, the Queen of Marsis now a curiosity of post-revolutionary Russian silent cinema, a bit laughable in its revolutionary zeal not only on Earth but on Mars as well! Despite a cool reaction from critics, the film was such a hit with the Soviet public that many Russian babies born in '24 were named Aelita, and the Cubist designs of the Martian sets--heavily influenced by the avant-garde \"constructivist\" style--would in turn influence science fiction films in the years to follow (most notably theFlash Gordonserials). With costume designs performances that are truly out of this world,Aelitawas the 1924 equivalent of a Spielberg spectacular; now it's a museum piece, unlikely to raise anyone's pulse, but it's startling to think that this film was even possible in 1924 Russia.The story is almost beside the point, revolving around a married Moscow engineer who dreams of Aelita, the Queen of Mars, and is obsessed with building a spaceship that will take him to her. An alleged murder, passionate jealousy, and a bumbling detective are all part of the film's portrait of hardscrabble post-revolutionary lifestyle, but they pale in comparison to the intermittent scenes on Mars, which peak with the engineer's ultimate arrival and the eruption of a Martian slave rebellion! It's pure propaganda, but agreeably light and remarkably revealing of its time and place. Anyone expecting a SovietMetropoliswill be disappointed, but if you're fascinated by imaginative films from the silent era,Aelitais must-see viewing.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00064AEXI", "B005MTAST2", "B0058OTM4S", "6305131104", "B00CP5VXWW", "B0040QYROA", "B000V7HFL4", "B001P3XYUE", "B0063E00HU", "B00D9BNONW", "B00006JMQG", "B00A44GNTE", "B000I8OOG0", "B00004S89X", "B00000ILF9", "B0053TWW6S", "6305301697", "B000AJJNA4", "B0013XZ6Y8", "B000056N7V", "B0006GAONG", "B004NTXH68", "B00004Z4TL", "B00007L4MH", "B001UHKPHU", "B000TUDHJ2", "B00006IUII", "B007UQ8ISI", "B0001US600", "B00478ED6S", "B00009XN8Y", "B0010WMV8Q", "B000H5U5IK", "B0018W2L0G", "B00006LPE4", "B004B9XRZ6", "B0001FVDT6", "B000HC2LOY", "B0002NRS46", "0500514143", "B001M9ELJE", "B005QAGC06", "B0000633T0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00064AEXI", "B0058OTM4S", "B0000E69HD", "B00005O5CA"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 258087}, "asin": "6305470286", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41V-wJ2brXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Aelita: Queen of Mars (1924)"}
{"description": "One of the most endearing and intelligent romantic comedies of the '90s, the Oscar-winningShakespeare in Loveis filled with such good will, sunny romance, snappy one-liners, and devilish cleverness that it's absolutely irresistible. With tongue placed firmly in cheek, at its outset the film tracks young Will Shakespeare's overwrought battle with writer's block and the efforts of theater owner Philip Henslowe (Geoffrey Rush, in rare form) to stage Will's latest comedy,Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter. Jokey comedy, though, soon takes a backseat to ravishing romance when the beautiful Viola De Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow) disguises herself as a young man to wangle herself an audition in the all-male cast, and wins both the part of Romeo and, after much misunderstanding, the playwright's heart. Soon enough, Will's pirate comedy becomes the beautiful, tragicRomeo and Juliet, reflecting the agony and ecstasy of Will and Viola's romance--he's married and she's set to marry the slimy Lord Wessex (Colin Firth) in the near future.The way that Oscar-winning screenwriters Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard enfold their story within the parameters ofRomeo and Juliet(and evenTwelfth Night) is nothing short of brilliant--it would take a Shakespearean scholar to dissect the innumerable parallels, oft-quoted lines, plot developments, and thematic borrowings. And most amazingly, Norman and Stoppard haven't forgotten to entertain their audience in addition to riding a Shakespearean roller coaster, with director John Madden (Mrs. Brown) reigning in his huge ensemble with rollicking energy. Along the way there are small gems to be found, including Judi Dench's eight-minute, Oscar-winning turn as atrulyregal Queen Elizabeth, but the key element ofShakespeare in Love's success rests on the milky-white shoulders of its two stars. Fiennes, inexplicably overlooked at Oscar time, is a dashing, heartfelt Will, and as for Best Actress winner Paltrow, well, nothing she'd done before could have prepared viewers for how amazing she is here. Breathtakingly beautiful, fiercely intelligent, strong-willed, and lovestruck--it's a performance worthy of Shakespeare in more ways than one. By the film's end, you'll be thoroughly won over--and brushing up your Shakespeare with newfound ardor.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790734060", "6304071876"], "also_viewed": ["B00006FN65"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 406033}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.72, "brand": "", "asin": "6305470448", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q5DABSM6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Shakespeare in Love [VHS]"}

Things only go downhill from there, of course, as they're mugged by an Andrew Lloyd Webber imposter, the high-tech multilingual navigation system on their rented Cadillac goes haywire, and their hotel reservations fall through. Though this movie is marred by some out-of-place slapstick and mawkish romance scenes, it's not without its funny moments. The couple stumbles into a sexual-addiction encounter group and has to try to back out gracefully (not succeeding very well, of course). John Cleese is howlingly funny as he reprises hisFawlty Towersrole of a cross-dressing hotelier, and Martin has a great drug-delirium scene, in which he's slipped a hit of LSD in jail (thinking it's aspirin).

{"description": "Let's get this straight: Drew Barrymore started a production company to develop original scripts outside of Hollywood and the first project she chose to produce was this, a romantic comedy written by USC grads Abby Kohn and Mark Silverstein about a nerdy, virginal woman who returns to high school as an undercover reporter, finally gets to be popular, and falls in love.

{"description": "\"I have a bad feeling about this,\" says the young Obi-Wan Kenobi  (played by Ewan McGregor) inStar Wars: Episode I, The Phantom  Menaceas he steps off a spaceship and into the most anticipated cinematic event... well, ever. He might as well be speaking for the  legions of fans of the original episodes in theStar Warssaga  who can't help but secretly ask themselves: Sure, this isStar  Wars, but is itmy Star Wars? The original elevated  moviegoers' expectations so high that it would have been impossible for  any subsequent film to meet them. And as with all theStar Warsmovies,The Phantom Menacefeatures inexplicable plot twists, a  fistful of loose threads, and some cheek-chewing dialogue. Han Solo's  swagger is sorely missed, as is the pervading menace of heavy-breathing  Darth Vader. There is still way too much quasi-mystical mumbo jumbo,  and some of what was fresh aboutStar Wars22 years earlier  feels formulaic. Yet there's much to admire. The special effects are  stupendous; three worlds are populated with a m&eacute;lange of creatures, flora, and horizons rendered in absolute  detail. The action and battle scenes are breathtaking in their  complexity. And one particular sequence of the film--the  adrenaline-infused pod race through the Tatooine desert--makes the chariot race inBen-Hurlook like a Sunday stroll through the park.Among the host of new characters, there are a few familiar walk-ons. We  witness the first meeting between R2-D2 and C-3PO, Jabba the Hutt looks  younger and slimmer (but not young and slim), and Yoda is as crabby as  ever. Natalie Portman's stately Queen Amidala sports hairdos that make  Princess Leia look dowdy and wields a mean laser. We never bond with  Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson), and Obi-Wan's day is yet to come. Jar Jar Binks, a cross  between a Muppet, a frog, and a hippie, provides many of the movie's lighter moments, while Sith Lord Darth  Maul is a formidable force. Baby-faced Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) looks too young  and innocent to command the powers of the Force or wield a lightsaber (much less transmute into the future Darth Vader), but his  boyish exuberance wins over skeptics.Near the end of the movie, Palpatine, the new leader of the Republic,  may be speaking for fans eagerly awaitingEpisode IIwhen he  pats young Anakin on the head and says, \"We will watch your career with  great interest.\" Indeed! --Tod Nelson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000633ZP", "6301792734", "B00005JLXH", "B00006HBUJ", "6304539258", "6304539274", "6301792769", "B000FQVX78", "6304539290", "0792158261", "B000FQJAJG", "6304117752", "0767729307", "B001GQSY5K", "6304178352", "B000FAGGWQ", "B00BBND56G", "B000FQJAIW", "B00005LL26", "B00003CXCT", "B00003CXI0", "B002I9Z8AS", "B00006AL1C", "B00CFWWDWE", "B000066HAS", "B000001ON6", "B000MUANT6", "6305587159"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLXH", "B00006HBUJ"], "also_viewed": ["B00006HBUJ", "B00005JLXH", "B00E9PMML2", "B0000633ZP", "6301792734", "B00BBND56G", "6304539258", "6301792769", "6304539274", "B00006JDUE", "0767729307", "B00E9PMMX0", "B000FQJAIW", "B000FQVX78", "B000FQJAJG", "B00000IQMT", "B000FAGGWQ", "B003ZSJ212", "0345434110", "6303148352", "6304089767", "0439834775", "6304117752", "B00BUZW14M", "6304500831", "0590010891", "0345341465", "6304434340", "B001GQSY5K", "155890641X", "B00005LL26", "6302961572", "0792151712", "B003W77SEO", "B000M4Y8JI", "0767825411", "B00003CXXI", "B00000IZ8A", "B00169IZN8", "6302787068", "B00006G8LB", "080010367X", "0800125762", "6302091632", "0792158261", "B000850IS6", "6300214826", "6303506291", "B00005V1Z8", "B000641D2Y", "0784011923", "B00008Y47S", "6300214060", "630382790X", "B00003CXI0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 79460}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.44, "brand": "Star Wars", "asin": "630575067X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41SJPKK4S4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Wars - Episode I, The Phantom Menace [VHS]"}

Colonel Breiteis, a female rocket pilot, and Major Moore, her co-pilot, are selected to orbit the Moon to survey a landing area for a future expedition, but a ruthless Russian spy-scientist aboard the ship causes it to land on the lunar surface, stranded and out of fuel. Will they live or die in these dire circumstances? Writer Heinlein gives us thrilling ideas of an orbital space station where people walk on the walls and ceilings, a rocketship that looks much like the real one that landed on the Moon in 1969, the American Space Force, commie spies and a woman President of the United States.Full Frame - B&W; - English - Mono", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000648YD", "6305869367", "6305761078", "B0002V7O2Y", "B000C20VNM", "B001BSBBJ4", "B001AD6UIC", "B000G28GHG", "6305944288", "B000FVQLKW", "B003XF1VUC", "B001AD54NE", "B00D9EJFZA", "B004CZZZQI", "B00AEBB94G", "B000063UR0", "B000EHSVJG", "B0007R4T26", "B000059H85", "B00465I1BK", "B00005Y6XR", "B00005R1O7", "B005TMY00K", "B00D3DJH7S", "B000056NWI", "B000YDOOHI", "B00358MG8S", "B004QF71ZW", "B00005R1O8", "B005TMXXX0", "B004CZZZTA", "B00D9EJFV4", "B00HFWETZ8", "B000SFJ4K4", "B007PXYVA0", "B00008973H", "6305772681", "B00009NHC0", "B004CZRE12", "B002TSAAS8", "B000OHZJNW", "B000EHSVJ6", "6305772711", "B0016B6ZJW", "B00AEBB8VK", "B00508W2Z8", "B00DOZNGC2", "B003J216K4", "B001DE29S8", "B000QGEB1W", "B000AYELJ2", "B00480OC0C", "B005HIBWBG", "B000OHZJGO", "B0044O1Q60", "B0000694WH", "B00518A70E", "B00005JKFR", "B000UAFDR0", "B00008ZL5C", "B00007JMD8", "B001BSBBIK", "B000HEWEDK", "B000SAGGL4", "B000UDGOB6", "B0001I55XI", "B000E991S4", "B0009ZBVBI", "B005ETANC2", "B000059PPL", "B0013XZ6SY", "B005E7SFDI", "B001DQH91I", "B00005B6KL", "B00FMGPWNW", "B00C7A8WZQ", "B0045HCJSA", "B0000542CN", "B004ZJ9VXY", "B0009PW3TC", "B003NHMYHO", "B000IOM1E6", "B002F3BPWW", "B000AQKU72", "B004RPQSVE", "B0066E6O7C", "B0047DKLCS", "0783240953", "B00006L90W", "B001BSBBNK", "B00ION69AK", "B000Y2Q9J0", "B007Y1NNAW", "B004VT9JLM", "B001LQQJ66", "B00004Z4VX", "B003CNQPO2", "B0049IHWT6", "B005OT7YX8", "B004QF721K"], "bought_together": ["B0000648YD", "6305761078"], "buy_after_viewing": ["6305869367", "6305761078", "B0000648YD", "B000FVQLKW"]}, "price": 9.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 24203}, "asin": "6305869359", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61B6K70ZQJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Project Moonbase"}

Enter widow Fay Anderson (Rachel Ward), with legs that could stop a truck and a half-baked scheme to kidnap the scion of a rich family, which she's dreamed up with her unctuous and untrustworthy Uncle Bud (Bruce Dern), and it's the beginning of the end for the likable Kid.After Dark, My Sweetis a film about judging people. No one is who they seem. Only by guessing their true intentions can Collins have a chance to survive.  The film also has brilliant performances by the three leads,  especially Dern, whose Uncle Bud is delightfully unhinged.  Director James Foley (Glengarry Glen Ross,The Corruptor) is subtly adept at fleshing out the characters and their ambiguities, which solves the problem inherent in adapting Thompson's sleazy tales--namely, that much of the drama is internal, and therefore unfilmable).--Wayne Karrfalt", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000GAKDP6", "B0043X1FKY", "B004YCKKFK", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B0009GX1CE", "B00HUTPKA4", "B00EL6A7XE", "B000069HZU", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B00GS08Y3Q", "B000063K2Q", "B0002T7YQW", "B00HT2L7VS", "B004F4HWMQ", "B00006L91I", "B00008L3S6", "B00013RC66", "B00002E20R", "B0007ZEOC8", "B00005R5G8", "B00006RCLT", "B00IKM5OCO", "B00I9BU3M2", "B00JVQ7PWU", "B009X919UE", "B002PJYPYG", "B005UZNC78", "B00005BCK9", "B000286RNE", "B00I9BU3L8", "0767818083", "B000GNOSDG", "B0043X1FNQ", "B00166UFA2", "B003VA3JTA", "B00008972P", "B00004REAG", "B00AEFXJF4", "B00008YJDK", "B00004ZBVF", "B00IJS2OHM", "B00E21D9ME", "B00005K3NU", "B00AEFXG2U", "B00IKM5MIA", "B002VWNICC", "B00ICWO1LC", "B000A0GOF0", "B00I9BU60Q", "B00441GZ00", "B0007R4T3K", "B00005BKZI", "B00C3ALM02", "B004XIWRW4", "B00D09AXUA", "B00HT2RTU6", "0792838947", "B00000K3TU", "B000EQ5SRK", "B000EZ9084", "B000063UR1", "B00005Y6XB", "B0000696I7", "B00018D40O", "B003U6SJY0", "B00FFFUYCO", "B00D3LA5WG", "B004499LWG", "B00F98FOFY", "B008XAT1LS", "B000UAE7J0", "B003ZJPAYY", "B006512BFU", "B00008DP4C", "B00112S8RS", "B004ALIG4M", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B000DZ7YN8", "B000HC2LHG", "B0000AMU7A", "B00GSA3K6C", "B00AEBB89W", "B00AEFXZ76", "B00CUKTHES", "B002TOL4AA", "B00AEFXEZE", "B00005AUJR", "B00006L92T", "B00E1LNDDU", "B0089LT800", "B00005JMIJ", "0792844874", "B001N44BVQ", "B00004W19C", "B000WMA6G4", "B000FVQM2Y", "B00023P4UQ", "B00006JDSJ", "6305133433"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0016K40KY", "B003LMPKSQ", "B00006RCLT", "B000GAKDP6"]}, "price": 16.03, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 445770}, "asin": "B00000ILFO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5147ET99WWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "After Dark My Sweet"}

{"description": "\"Jesus' Son\" is the story of a young man's circuitous journey from drug dependency and petty crime to a life redeemed by his startling discovery of compassion. Set in the drug subculture of the 1970's, a young man in his twenties (Billy Crudup) careens through his days getting stoned, stealing, or scamming a quick buck. He is driven by an overwhelming desire to help those around him, to save them from their often sorry fates, but he repeatedly fails. Almost by a miracle, redemption does come to the young man. It sneaks up on him almost imperceptibly, through barely observed lessons learned from a colorful parade of characters who range from a crazed, pill-popping hospital orderly (Jack Black), a down-on-his-luck-divorcee (Denis Leary), to a half-paralyzed woman (Holly Hunter) who teaches him about love. Bit by bit, the young man stumbles towards sobriety and lands a job at an assisted living facility where he discovers the depths of his own compassion for others, and the grace that comes with it.", "related": {"also_bought": ["031242874X", "6305594333", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00006RCNV", "B0007CEXYK", "B00H0EN948", "B00005Q4CS", "B00003CWTI", "B000QXDCLA", "0374280509", "0767830555", "0060988827", "B00D3LA5WG", "B00005JM23", "B0000549B1", "B0012E2GFK", "B0007NMHOC", "B0042U9B3G", "B000I0QL7I", "B000286RP2", "B00049QQHI", "B00470MG06", "B00004U03T", "0374279128", "B00005AUJK", "B00004ZBVO", "B00007ELES", "B009AMALBM", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00008DP4C", "B000QQFKYE", "B009POCG0Y", "B0082A3HFK", "B00DX88ISM", "B000092T3X", "B001152TL6", "B0000BWVCR", "B00005N8A9", "B00005YU1O", "B002VWNIDG", "B00A1O0G5E", "B003Y5H4R0", "B00003CXZ4", "1250007658", "B004C45AZU", "B009AMAL4Y", "B0006GAOJA", "B00027JYLC", "0767827902", "B00AEFXJ86", "6304907729", "B00AEFYSWM", "B0008ENICU", "B00AEFXN9G", "B001R3YRG2", "B008220DGE", "B0076YFJPE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["031242874X", "B00049QQHI", "B00004U03T", "0312427743"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 324458}, "asin": "B00003CWS6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51642HMG0SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jesus' Son"}

{"description": "Before it ever arrived in the U.S., this epic, animated 1997 fantasy had already made history as the top-grossing domestic feature ever released in Japan, where its combination of mythic themes, mystical forces, and ravishing visuals tapped deeply into cultural identity and contemporary, ecological anxieties. For international animation andanimefans,Princess Mononokerepresents an auspicious next step for its revered creator, Hayao Miyazaki (My Neighbor Totoro,Kiki's Delivery Service), an acknowledgedanimepioneer, whose painterly style, vivid character design, and stylized approach to storytelling take ambitious, evolutionary steps here.Set in medieval Japan, Miyazaki's original story envisions a struggle between nature and man. The march of technology, embodied in the dark iron forges of the ambitious Tatara clan, threatens the natural forces explicit in the benevolent Great God of the Forest and the wide-eyed, spectral spirits he protects. When Ashitaka, a young warrior from a remote, and endangered, village clan, kills a ravenous, boar-like monster, he discovers the beast is in fact an infectious \"demon god,\" transformed by human anger. Ashitaka's quest to solve the beast's fatal curse brings him into the midst of human political intrigues as well as the more crucial battle between man and nature.Miyazaki's convoluted fable is clearly not the stuff of kiddie matinees, nor is the often graphic violence depicted during the battles that ensue. If some younger viewers (or less attentive older ones) will wish for a diagram to sort out the players, Miyazaki's atmospheric world and its lush visual design are reasons enough to watch. For the English-language version, Miramax assembled an impressive vocal cast including Gillian Anderson, Billy Crudup (as Ashitaka), Claire Danes (as San), Minnie Driver (as Lady Eboshi), Billy Bob Thornton, and Jada Pinkett Smith. They bring added nuance to a very different kind of magic kingdom.

{"description": "To callPearl Harbora throwback to old-time war movies is something of an understatement. Director Michael Bay's epic take on the bombing that brought the United States into World War II hijacks every war movie situation and clich&#xE9; (some affectionate, some stale) you've ever seen and gives them a shiny, glossy spin until the whole movie practically gleams. Planes glisten, water sparkles, trees beckon--and Bay's re-creation of the bombing itself, a 30-minute sequence that's tightly choreographed and amazingly photographed, sets the action movie bar up quite a few notches. And in updating the classic war film, Bay and screenwriter Randall Wallace (Braveheart) use that old plot standby, the love triangle--this time, it's between two pilots (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) and a nurse (Kate Beckinsale) who find themselves stationed at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, during what they thought would be a nice, sunny tour of duty. Then, of course, history intervened.For the first 90 minutes of the movie, Affleck and Beckinsale find a nice, appealing chemistry that plays on his strengths as a movie star and hers as a serious actress--he gives her glamour, she gives him smarts. Their truncated romance--the beginning of which is told in flashback so we can get right to the point where he has to leave her to go to England--works, thanks to their charm. They're no Kate and Leo fromTitanic(a strategy the film strives hard toward), but they're pretty darn adorable in their own right. Hartnett, as the not entirely unwelcome third wheel, squints bravely but makes only a slight dent in the film. Everyone else inPearl Harbor--from Cuba Gooding Jr.'s brave navy seaman to Jon Voight's able impersonation of FDR--is pretty much a glorified walk-on, taking a backseat to the pyrotechnics and action sequences that keep the three-hour film in fairly constant motion. But when that action does take hold,Pearl Harboris quite a thrilling ride.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792151712", "B000059HGY", "B00000K3AN", "B00AEBBA36", "0792133153", "079212569X", "6305169187", "6301734734", "0792147618", "0792116887", "6304618344", "079213690X", "6303269834", "6304925131", "6305718792", "6304259131", "B00004WIDB", "6304935811", "6303057225", "6304143184", "6302250269"], "bought_together": ["B00000K3AN", "B00AEBBA36"], "also_viewed": ["B00000G3PA", "0792151712", "6300213668", "B00000JS61", "6303215734", "6303402348", "B00004WIDB", "079213690X", "6305750750", "B004751DFU", "B00005O893", "B00000K3AN", "6301792734", "B00E5I2MCM", "6305169187", "B00007LVCM", "B007SPPANM", "B00L4K3MLE", "B00FLML7HW", "B008QZ5PY2", "B00JBGWP3Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 234413}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.49, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXTF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HC1ZDJN6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]"}
{"description": "LikeSaving Private Ryan,Enemy at the Gatesopens with a  pivotal event of World War II--the German invasion of  Stalingrad--re-created in epic scale, as ill-trained Russian soldiers  face German attack or punitive execution if they flee from the enemy's  advance. Director Jean-Jacques Annaud captures this madness with urgent  authenticity, creating a massive context for a more intimate battle  waged amid the city's ruins. Embellished from its basis in fact, the  story shifts to an intense cat-and-mouse game between a Russian shepherd  raised to iconic fame and a German marksman whose skill is unmatched in  its lethal precision. Vassily Zaitzev (Jude Law) has been sniping Nazis  one bullet at a time, while the German Major Konig (Ed Harris) has been  assigned to kill Vassily and spare Hitler from further embarrassment.There's love in war as Vassily connects with a woman soldier (Rachel  Weisz), but she is also loved by Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), the Soviet  officer who promotes his friend Vassily as Russia's much-needed hero.  This romantic rivalry lends marginal interest to the central plot, but  it's not enough to make this a classic war film. Instead it's a taut,  well-made suspense thriller isolated within an epic battle, and although  Annaud and cowriter Alain Godard (drawing from William Craig's book and  David L. Robbins's novelThe War of the Rats) fail to connect  the parallel plots with any lasting impact, the production is never less  than impressive. Highly conventional but handled with intelligence and  superior craftsmanship, this is warfare as strategic entertainment,  without compromising warfare as a manmade hell on Earth.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFXRRO", "B004U7MQWY", "B00AEBBA36", "B00001ZWUS", "B0007KIFGE", "B000065U1N", "B0015D20FE", "B001KZOUU0", "B00005PJ8T", "079284646X", "B001TUZG4K", "B00005JPKE", "B000095WW8", "B00003CXHJ", "B009XTF8NI", "0792839730", "B000M4RG42", "B00005JK8K", "B000P0J09C", "B00275EGWY", "B00003CXTG", "B003ASLJOU", "B003ELKNH2", "B000EHSVSC", "B004C45AZU", "B00AEFXKUI", "B00004XPPG", "0142000000", "B0007TKNGA", "B00HEPE6MM", "B00B0U2SFE", "B00005N5S3", "B00005PJ8S", "B00AEFYBA6", "B00006CXSS", "B00005ASGB", "B002ZG97RE", "B0007TKNLA", "0767802470", "B00IVLR9JA", "B00A34LX2M", "B00AEFY0F2", "0767817745", "B001LMAK9M", "B0000542CK", "B005LAIGYQ", "B000EHSVS2", "B00AEBB86U", "B00D3XMA9A", "B0000714C4", "B000XR9L50", "B000H1RFSM", "B005E2YL3Q", "B004TXFFI6", "6304698747", "0792838041", "B00008AOTR", "B000ELL1R6", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B000E5N63Y", "B000YBKO6U", "B00BY0EBK0", "6305558167", "B002O3Z50Q", "B00005PJ8K", "B006TTC5HC", "B0007TKNM4", "B00AEFY4IA", "6304765258", "B00AEBB86A", "B000DZIGDU", "B000FVQLRA", "B00AEFY5B6", "6305692688", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AMSLDTM", "B0000TANUI", "B00JA3RVG4", "B004SIP6QI", "B000O599YO", "B000MZHW40", "B00004XPPC", "0792838408", "B007HCI42A", "B0009RCPUC", "B00005B6JZ", "B0002YLCG0", "B00CZB9BE8", "B002O3Z510", "B00005OSJQ", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005QAQI", "B000CNESN0", "B00008AOTO", "B005DKS1TE", "B00DL48BM6", "0792841662", "B0001NBMH6", "B0001FGC1U", "6304711891"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFXRRO", "B00AEBBA36"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFXRRO", "B00AEBBA36", "B00HEPE6MM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22765}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.69, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B00003CXRA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510oEAHvU8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Enemy at the Gates"}

{"description": "A prime example of the American film noir style that flourished during the 1940s and '50s,The Big Combois now highly regarded as a stylistic milestone for its innovative use of deep shadows and harsh, singular light sources to define its visual strategy. This look is largely credited to the rule-breaking brilliance of cinematographer John Alton, who turns a standard plot of the era into a richly atmospheric experiment in visual invention. Ignoring conventional approaches to lighting, Alton defines the screen in terms of blackness, often framing characters as silhouettes cast in ominous grays or thick, roiling fogs. Moving from clarity to abstraction with masterful grades in between, Alton's trend-setting style has been celebrated by cinematographers since the film's release in 1955.The film's plot keeps brisk pace with the visuals, focusing on the obsessive efforts of a tenacious detective (Cornel Wilde) to destroy a sadistic mobster (Richard Conte) whose vicious influence has nearly ruined the life of the woman (Jean Wallace) he keeps under his dark wing. Lee Van Cleef and Earl Holliman are nicely cast as the villain's toady henchmen, and Brian Donlevy's usual limitations serve him well as the humbled, frustrated kingpin who's been stifled by Conte's ambition. Director  Joseph&nbsp;H. Lewis previously demonstrated his raw, stylistic vigor with the  earlier cult favoriteGun Crazy, and here he's in peak form with a perfect match of subject and sensibility. The result is hard-boiled entertainment that still packs a punch.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00EL6A7XE", "B00E21D9ME", "B00023P4GA", "B009X919UE", "B0009X7678", "B00E6AVGKI", "B00C3ALM02", "B000KJTGFG", "B00D09AXUA", "B0007ZEO7S", "B0080JG2GE", "B00FPUN21O", "B001CC7PM6", "B004C2523M", "B000B8384Q", "B000B8380A", "B00BGARG3C", "B000EXDSBQ", "B00ICWO1LC", "B00I9BU60Q", "B00023P4II", "B0007ZEO8C", "B0024FAG80", "B00023P4FQ", "B00023P4G0", "B0024FAG8A", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B000B83846", "B00DO0MEOS", "B00005RDRL", "B000CNE088", "B00CN70WS8", "B00005AUK9", "B00004W19C", "B000RXVND8", "B0006UEVVS", "B000LN6UHI", "B000EXDSBG", "B00I9BU3M2", "B00007ELD1", "B0009X7682", "B00DBE97S8", "B00004XPPK", "B0006Z2NE0", "B000087F79", "B00004W229", "B00I9BU3L8", "B000CNE08I", "B00BM4Q46M", "B00KIZY3XW", "B0000CNY4Z", "B0010KHOSU", "B00BM4Q4PI", "B0089LT800", "B0089LT7ZG", "B00H8J2NTC", "B004H0M2UK", "B002YNQEFG", "B00CVB6XF2", "B00097DXY4", "B000244EWY", "B0024FAG6W", "B00DZP1BVO", "B00006II5J", "B0000EYUDY", "B000244EX8", "B000BGH2NG", "B00I116MVQ", "B00B27WRJM", "B00AB2NX4M", "B00B27WQ6G", "B001CC7PLW", "B00005AUKD", "B000FKO3VC", "B00AEBBA7W", "B00012L786", "B000FKO3VM", "B0080JG2L4", "B00004RER5", "B00FX6TYZS", "B00005Y70U", "B006X0ZN3K", "6305770328", "B00005Y70Q", "B00457ZNS8", "B00AB2NX1K", "B00DZP1C9K", "B0009X766O", "B00JX3SHIC", "B006WQUGI2", "B00KIZYDCI", "B008BSM1CI", "B000PKG7CU", "B008BSM1XC", "B0010KHOSA", "B0026ZQJT8", "B005152C9G", "B00DBE98OG", "B00D9BNONW", "B000CNE08S"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BGARG3C", "B00EL6A7XE", "B0087ZG7OI", "B00E21D9ME"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 349701}, "asin": "B00003XALW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/714FYEYPNDL._SY300_.gif", "title": "The Big Combo"}

{"description": "The second grab bag of 007 adventures features three Bonds in five films, including the legendary movie that started it all. In 1962 Sean Connery defined the cinematic James Bond as a tough, charming, and thoroughly professional cold war spy with a license to kill in the lean, hard-edgedDr. No. With Ursula Andress (as the original Bond girl Honey Ryder, who makes her entrance in a bikini), Bond battles a renegade supervillain with little more than his wits, his cunning, and his Walther PPK (this was before Q armed him with the coolest toys a superspy ever had). George Lazenby, a handsome Australian model with a self-effacing confidence, made his first and only appearance as James Bond in the underratedOn Her Majesty's Secret Service, a witty and action-packed adventure that makes 007 history when Bond marries the girl (the lovely and talented Diana Rigg, fresh from her duties as the butt-kicking spy on the TV seriesThe Avengers). Roger Moore brought a light tone and a suave assurance to the series as the third Bond, and the set features three of his seven appearances. InThe Man with the Golden Gun, he battles million-dollar assassin Christopher Lee, one of Bond's most magnetic adversaries.The Spy Who Loved Me, perhaps Moore's finest hour, is a return to the extravagant set pieces and cold war thrills of Connery's pictures and introduces Richard Kiel's steel-dentured Jaws to the series. Jaws returns as a comic figure inMoonraker, a misguided sci-fi entry that takes Bond to space for a physically impressive but dramatically lackluster adventure. More of a mixed bag than the initial seven-filmJames Bond Gift Set, this set is aimed at the Bond completist rather than the general fan. The DVD editions of the films each feature audio commentary by the director and key members of the crew, \"making of\" documentaries, and a host of stills, TV spots, and trailers.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000BYRO9", "B00006BH8G", "B001PPLIEG", "B00AQSN7HE", "B007REV4T8", "B00004WEJZ", "B00000K2SQ", "B00AZFECL8", "B001R10BN2", "B000RPCK1A", "B00000BLFI", "B000RPCK1K", "B000M53GNG", "B000NIBUR6", "B000M53GMW", "B000ICM5V2", "B00004RG62", "B00000BCPF", "B00005JL0I", "B001EDVNNU", "B000RPCK1U", "B000RPCK24", "B000M53GN6", "B000NIBURQ", "B000NDEXPM", "B000M53GM2", "B000M53GMC", "B000NDEXPC", "B000M53GLS", "B005PTYP70", "B000RPCK0Q", "B009RO9LKK", "B000NIBUS0", "B000ICM5VC", "B000NIBURG", "B001F12J0C", "B004BR7XLM", "B00G7QQ0RS", "B00DH34G9S", "B000EHSVS2", "1612185517", "B008YAPQX4", "B0087ZG7Q6", "B000QUU4LY", "B00AZMFJYA", "B002GSXKN8", "B001E75QH0", "B001HQZJMU", "B009PN18R2", "B008JFURII", "B007REV4YI", "B0011NVC98", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00008G8M4", "1618930311", "B008JFUOWM"], "bought_together": ["B0000BYRO9", "B00006BH8G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B006U1JD5G", "B007REV4T8", "B00006BH8G", "B008YAPQX4"]}, "price": 75.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 155749}, "asin": "B00004RG67", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JTH02YW9L._SX300_.jpg", "title": "The James Bond Collection, Volume 2"}
{"description": "Is your classical Greek rusty? This is just the thing--a feast of epic Greek mythology--and the classic tale of Good (Jason, Theseus, Hercules, Orpheus) versus Evil (angry gods, Poseidon, Harpies, the women of Lemnos) is a great introduction.

His judge and jury will be Pinhead (Doug Bradley) and his legion of  twisted Cenobites, but before he can be tried and condemned, Sheffer's cop will watch as those around him are killed off one by one, leaving a trail of blood (and telltale severed fingers) that leads back to the torment of his own youth.So, what you really have here is a variation onIt's a Wonderful LifeandA Christmas Carol, with all the themes reversed to hellish extremes. The plot doesn't hold together all that well, but you can't fault the film for establishing and maintaining a heavily somber tone. This is pretty dark stuff, after all, and althoughHellraiserfans will lament that Pinhead's appearance is relatively brief, he's presented here in an intriguing new light--not merely an icon of pain and suffering, but a giver of counsel and justice to those (like Sheffer's cop) who arguably deserve the eternal anguish they will receive. Does that make Pinhead a good guy? If this otherwise lugubrious sequel achieves anything, it's that it raises that question and lets the viewer decide.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004YCKJFG", "B00006ADFZ", "B004XYOQOA", "B004P7CMPK", "B0053TWVIM", "B0056P6SOG", "6305972001", "B00004Y633", "B000I2J68M", "B002HML6YI", "B0080QOKZM", "B008874968", "B000MV8AC2", "B001AGNMFI", "B000099T3M", "B004P7CM9Q", "B001NPD9LS", "B00BM4Q4H6", "B00AEFY2WI", "B009IV2Z3M", "B00AEFY31S", "B000FA57UI", "B00005LQ0Z", "B00AEFY2AA", "B00005LC4Q", "B00AEFY37C", "B004TJWDJY", "B004AC6PMG", "B00AEFY2LO", "B004P7CNF4", "B000WC3864", "B000VKL6Z2", "B000FA57US", "B0031U8OEK", "B000096I9V", "0783227434", "B0052XU4BK", "B004SUDQ0Y", "B0000ALPFL", "B009B8YNGO", "B000FS9FE4", "B00005NRN6", "B00AEFY2E6", "B0002IQMAM", "B00006IUFV", "B004P7CNUY", "0783230451", "B004SUDQ9K", "B000MV8ABS", "B00EVU3RSW", "B00006LPHA", "B0001611DI", "B001D5C1R6", "B0016MJ6P6", "B002YICNE2", "B0001US7OA", "B0000AOX08", "B00CERJINC", "B001B1UO6W", "B0000CEB6Y", "B00D7AM6M0", "B0000AOX09", "B00B4VSUW4", "B00AEFYV9W", "B001AXOFR0", "B0053TWW9K", "B002KH4KSY", "B000Q66Q8I", "B001JV5BIA", "0780630874", "B005CFBZQ6", "B00005N5RM", "B00006FDBT", "B004P7CNN6", "B0026UZHS2", "B00005JO16", "B0091G7BTM", "B000KJU1KK", "B0033B5XCS", "B000LC3ID8", "B0001LQJMQ", "B0050UEVN2", "B0058S0OMS", "B007I1Q4W2", "B000067FP8", "B0054602SU", "B005J9ZFQG", "B00AEFY1V0", "B000NVT0SO", "B000063US5", "B0009X76PK", "B00079Z9WI", "B00006FI0R", "B00105303S", "B002V3HT2G", "B005QX8UEE", "B00AEBB91E", "B0053FANPY", "B00005N5S5"], "bought_together": ["B004YCKJFG", "B004XYOQOA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0056P6SOG", "B004XYOQOA", "B004YCKJFG", "B008874968"]}, "price": 6.44, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 170962}, "asin": "B00004Y634", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511F5VDVMNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hellraiser: Inferno"}

{"description": "\"The Changeling\"After destroying 4 billion people in the Malurian star system, a 21st-century NASA probe called Nomad--carrying friendly greetings to whatever unknown, extraterrestrial race might find it--has a violent encounter with theEnterprise, nearly blowing the starship out of the skies. Hoping to sidestep another attack, Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock invite the diminutive, computer-driven, impossibly powerful spacecraft aboard to learn how its peaceful mission was supplanted by a program to destroy life. Written by John Meredyth Lucas, who was intrigued by the idea of a sentient, almost godlike machine that turns against its creator, \"The Changeling\" transcends, fortunately,Star Trek's cash-strapped special effects department (let's just say Nomad looks like a cross between the Tin Man and a 1960s beach radio) to become a compelling drama. Particularly memorable is Spock's mind-melding scene with Nomad, in which the Vulcan is shaken by the probe's chaotic memories of being captured and given destructive impulses. FrequentTrekdirector Marc Daniels was particularly proud of the way his crew made Nomad appear capable of independent movement: there was one model for hanging from a wire, a second for standing on a floor, and a third for riding on a dolly (to get a sinister, point-of-view traveling shot). If \"The Changeling\" sounds vaguely familiar, it should: the script was rewritten as the basis forStar Trek: The Motion Picture.--Tom Keogh\"The Apple\"A landing party beams down to Gamma Trianguli VI, a lush planet that's just like paradise... or is it? This isnotthe episode to be caught wearing a red shirt in: dangers abound and crew members drop like flies. Soon the party discovers a seemingly unspoiled tribe of innocents who spend their lives serving the god Vaal. Can it be that it's time to disobey the prime directive? The natives are all beautiful people with loincloths and entertaining hairdos, and of course Mr. Scott has an engineering dilemma. Another highlight is the sequence in which the natives learn a few facts of life from a particularly randy Mr. Chekov.

{"description": "The trial of Nazi war criminals following the Allied victory in Europe in World War II is dramatized in this uneven TV movie starring Alec Baldwin as Robert Jackson, a U.S. Supreme Court justice who served as the chief prosecutor for the Allies. The gravity of the controversial concept of having a war crimes trial, and the political maneuvering between Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union that made it possible, is explained fairly well in the early portions of the film, even if Baldwin at times delivers lines that seem to have been lifted from a high school history textbook. Scenes of Nazi officers being rounded up and jailed are evocative, as are scenes of a ruined Germany. But a subplot involving Baldwin's character having an extramarital affair with his secretary,  played by Jill Hennessy, seems utterly extraneous. Perhaps the intent was to show that even someone taking a moral stand on a global stage can be flawed, but Baldwin's Supreme Court justice faces no consequences from his infidelity. Baldwin dominates the courtroom scenes as the outraged prosecutor, while Hennessy has little to do beyond looking great in her 1940s wardrobe. And as the film progresses the brilliant performance of Brian Cox as Hermann Goering simply seizes all attention, as Hitler's deputy is uncannily portrayed as a brilliant manipulator to the very end.Nurembergis consistently interesting, and to its credit it does contain much serious material on the Nazi war crimes, but it is in the end a flawed production.--Robert J.

{"description": "Mostly for Poirot completists and admirers of then-trendy, all-star ensemble casts from the 1970s and early '80s,Evil Under the Sunfinds Peter Ustinov in his second outing as Agatha Christie's famous Belgian detective (three years after 1978'sDeath on the Nile). As the title promises, the action this time takes place on an Adriatic island (though Christie fans will surely balk at the switch from the novel's setting on the English coast), where a famous stage star (Diana Rigg) is murdered, and the list of likely suspects is unusually high. The parade of legendary performers--Roddy McDowall, James Mason, Sylvia Miles, Maggie Smith, Jane Birkin--plus Ustinov's energetic performance keep things hopping. But Anthony Shaffer's lazy screenplay and director Guy Hamilton's superficial approach nudge everything (action, characters, tone) toward campy, near-parody, with bitchy sniping, tacky costumes, and an obligatory soundtrack of Cole Porter tunes. It's only in the last lap that the film transcends such obviousness and finds its way back to the glories of detective fiction.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001KP2J3U", "B00AEFYO5I", "B001KP2J3K", "B000GB5M1A", "B00005QBZL", "B00005RDRO", "B002Q3MYA8", "B000GB5M1K", "B000068QOB", "B000GB5M1U", "B000CSTK38", "B00000JGHT", "B00AEFXNXW", "B000199JJI", "B0090XLDO0", "B000068UE9", "B004HHX9H8", "B00A0HT99G", "B003L80FLC", "B00005Q4D6", "0790741318", "B00005KH4B", "B00000I0DA", "B00008K772", "B0028AENVC", "B004HJ0ZLE", "B005X5XINI", "B000059LGD", "B00347AIRQ", "B008RNYMPG", "B00GWXHYPI", "B00GWXI0S8", "B00GAXASKS", "B001KP2J44", "B007CBWXD2", "B00D7AM2V0", "B000CRR36K", "B002HR456E", "B007ISJS0U", "B008N8A3O4", "B002MUAXJY", "630560097X", "B00GAXASLC", "B000CRR3EC", "B0008ENICU", "B00ICWO1LC", "B00KIZY3XW", "B00AEBB97S", "B00871C09S", "B000OHBCI8", "B002XDR5NC", "B000CC1TNI", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B0019K4YRU", "B00598OA7W", "B00DW5IKWK", "B000199JJS", "B00GHH9I62", "B00005RIX1", "B00EF0NYVI", "B00CBVWWLQ", "B00A27O5AW", "B0083HXKM2", "B00BDSRM4K", "B004Z74X0M", "B008N8A3DA", "B000GAKFIG", "B000G67M4U", "B0007Y3XRG", "B00347AIOE", "B008L0YN22", "B00598O9RI", "B005DVIPY4", "B005X5XI4C", "B00009ZPU3", "B00E8AVN9U", "B00GWXI16O", "B000IJ7AGK", "B004WMOSNM", "B0002HOEQ2", "0062073710", "B005H8G78O", "B006JY3O2M", "0783226853", "B00E44EZUE", "B003N2SUKY", "B000056HEA", "B001BGS17Q", "B00GWXI20E", "B005CFBZX4", "B00007G1WH", "B00GWXI2MC", "B00GWXI2RM", "B002TOL4EG", "B000ATQYWY", "B002GSXKQA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001KP2J44", "B001KP2J3U", "B00AEFYO5I", "B00005RDRO"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 247598}, "asin": "B000059LGF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51W8TYE3MPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Evil Under the Sun"}

{"description": "It's a good thing Sandra Bullock knows her strengths and weaknesses, because without Bullock as star and producer,Miss Congenialitywould be an insufferable mess as opposed to being a mildly enjoyable trifle that is custom-made for Bullock's established screen persona. Only Bullock's fans could really appreciate this fluff (even then they'll wish its ripe premise had been more intelligently handled), but it's not without some highlights to accompany Bullock's reliable charms. Here she plays clumsy, nerdy FBI agent Gracie Hart, who is given the horrific pseudonym Gracie Lou Freebush (one example of the movie's juvenile tendencies) when assigned to infiltrate a beauty pageant to investigate threats of a terrorist attack.Transforming Bullock from frumpy to stunning is a piece of cake (although she gives pageant coach Michael Caine a run for his money), so the movie's premise is trivial at best. More enjoyable is her character's uncouth disdain for pageant contestants and her mistaken perception that they're all a bunch of bimbos. The movie nicely charts Gracie's realization that her own pageant makeover provides a much-needed ego boost. In addition to Caine's effortless scene-stealing, pageant host William Shatner and organizer Candice Bergen are smart choices for comedic support (Shatner's a perfect Bert Parks wannabe), but the movie desperately needs a credible foundation for its comedy to really pay off. Bullock's bureau boss (Benjamin Bratt) is an unconvincing dimwit, and none of the plotting is as smart as sayBeverly Hills Copin combining procedure with laughs. That leaves Bullock to carry the burden of a comedy that just barely works in her favor.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009KA2OA", "B00005O5CM", "B00005JM55", "6304765266", "B002K0WBXW", "B00081U7HC", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B00003CXSM", "B00006ZXSL", "B00008NRI7", "B002VECM6S", "B00007E2F5", "B0006GANOQ", "B00AEBB8NS", "B00003CXMP", "B0000524E5", "B00AEFY99O", "B00006FMUW", "B000HEWEE4", "B002NZK5V4", "B000YDBPAM", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00AEBB8R4", "B000CEV3M8", "B002O3Z50G", "B004SEUJK0", "B000J4QW7W", "B00E8RKHWW", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B00AEFYM2S", "B000209KMW", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00006ZXSK", "B0045HCJJ4", "B00447L4KA", "B00AMEZDJW", "B00008WJD6", "B0000897EG", "B000QUU4LY", "B000MQC9H4", "B00AEFXYOA", "B0000DIXDR", "B000XT1P3E", "0800177258", "0783225504", "B000NA1WE0", "6305236569", "B000023VTP", "B000FO0A9W", "B002SYAGNC", "B001ECDVK4", "B00003CXFV", "B00AEFYF2K", "B000J103OI", "B00005JG6N", "B0036TGSIK", "B00466HN7M", "B00000G3PA", "B0000AOV4I", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFY5TI", "B0015I2RT8", "B001ECDVJU", "B004SIP8JI", "B00005KAQP", "B000ELJAEM", "B0049TC88U", "B002NZK5UU", "B00006ZXSQ", "B00008G8M4", "B004SIP9RO", "6305212112", "B000A343RI", "B004SIP9X8", "0783225733", "6302077818", "B002GHHHP6", "B002GIBVWA", "B00AEBB9WI", "0800141806", "B000683VI4", "B00795C5X4", "B002NZK5RS", "B00003CXTA", "B000JYW5BE", "B00005JM9Q", "B004EPZ070", "B00AEFXZJE", "B003L20IHE", "B007L6VMDK", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00386EZKE", "B000CCBCAI", "B00007BKVC", "0783235070", "B00AEFXWXI", "B000CEV3KU", "B00005BCKF", "B00AEBB8YW", "B0006N2EZ0"], "bought_together": ["B00005O5CM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000NA1WE0", "B003PIUIJC", "6304765266", "B00005O5CM"]}, "price": 9.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 77252}, "asin": "B00005AAA9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514V9KPFJRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Miss Congeniality"}

{"description": "Keanu Reeves stars in this story that might best be described asBad News Bearsin the projects. Conor O'Neill (Reeves) is a charming ne'er-do-well with a disturbing gambling addiction. His penchant for betting on the wrong teams leaves him owing several thousand dollars to very violent people, and he ends up coaching a children's baseball team to pay off his debt. The movie skimps a bit on process: the kids start out as terrible players and become better but we don't see how; Conor starts caring but we don't see why. As by-the-numbers movies go, though, it isn't a bad one. The young actors in the cast are talented and understated. Most of the kids' characters are only barely fleshed out by the script, but this keeps the movie from being hijacked by extra-cute mugging. Parents should be cautioned--this movie has some very violent scenes that will frighten young children, and swearing is depicted as precocious and adorable. Still, like a baseball game, it isn't a bad way to spend your time.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000KHYN9C", "B00004Y2R1", "B00AMEZDJW", "B00000JGHV", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B002O3Z4XY", "B00AEFXOKO", "B0000633U2", "6305505780", "B00005JPK8", "B004GJYROG", "B0012YYZDG", "B00009AOAX", "078324021X", "B00003CY51", "B00AEFYE08", "B002GIBVWA", "B00005M20J", "B00E1HIWU8", "B0006J28MI", "B005SQRYEG", "B001DJLD12", "B0007LLPXI", "630514415X", "B000068NNU", "B0000JBUHI", "B003VE9WTW", "B00AEFXHNI", "B00DW5IKW0", "B000089771", "B000BITV9W", "1558908390", "B0001MMGC2", "B000089778", "B0010YSD90", "B000056VP4", "B00066FAQW", "B00005A3KS", "B00E1HIX66", "B00005JLG1", "B00005JLRZ", "B00028HBES", "6304821832", "0788815466", "B000FS9ULC", "B00AEFXSLE", "B000069I0E", "B001BP4K22", "0783230338", "B002GSXKOM", "B0010YSD8Q", "B00ANDDBBY", "B00DNF1SSC", "B000069I1K", "630592273X", "B0006GAI5U", "B000PE0GRI", "B000EXZFCQ", "B00006SFL7", "B0060ZJ7BC", "B00006LPH6", "B004GJYRF0", "B002VWNICM", "B004499NII", "B00AEFXGWK", "B000063RQO", "B00007BK2S", "B000053VAX", "6305428271", "B000G0O5I2", "B00008979O", "B0009A40NO", "B00005NRO0", "B00DQCSWUE", "B000WD3XKO", "6305065551", "0783230524", "B004WJT5E2", "B000XSWVEC", "B0000YEE6M", "B002CA68N4", "B000MNOX9E", "B009NNM9OA", "B000089773", "B000J10F14", "B00AEBB9UU", "B0006GANOQ", "B00AEFYKWU", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00007LP8J", "B00AEFY17E", "B002NZK5U0", "B0009K7RMA", "B00595W4CI", "B00L4K3MLE", "B000HDZKLO", "B000BOH8X2", "B000FUTVLY", "B00003W8NT", "0783237367"], "bought_together": ["B00AMEZDJW", "B00004Y2R1"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AMEZDJW", "B002O3Z4XY", "B00DNF1SSC", "B005SQRYEG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10614}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.81, "brand": "Team Marketing", "asin": "B00005JKE4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R4A6RG4XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hardball"}

Night Shyamalan talks at length about the film and his filmmaking technique in this exclusive one-hour feature. The approach is straightforward but at times is as self-congratulatory as a marketing puff piece. Because Shyamalan works so leanly, the five deleted scenes are excellent, including a chilling scene from the film's final act.

{"description": "Of all the spinoff TV incarnations ofStar Trek,Deep Space Ninehad the hardest job persuading an audience to watch. By all accounts, Gene Roddenberry had concerns about the idea before his death in 1991. It took two more years to develop, and when it finally aired in 1993 reasons for that concern were evident right away. The show was dark (literally), characters argued a lot, no one went anywhere, and the neighboring natives were hardly ever friendly. Yet for all that the show went against the grain of the Great Bird's original vision of the future, it undeniably caught the mood of the time, incorporating a complex political backdrop that mirrored our own.In the casting, there was a clear intent to differentiate the show from its predecessors. Genre stalwarts Tony Todd and James Earl Jones were considered for Commander Sisko before Avery Brooks. The one letdown at the time was that Michelle Forbes did not carry Ensign Ro across fromThe Next Generation, but when the explosive Nana Visitor defiantly slapped her hand on a console in the pilot episode, viewers knew they were in for a different crew dynamic. In fact, the two-part pilot show (\"The Emissary\") is largely responsible forDS9's early success. Mysterious, spiritual, claustrophobic, funny, and feisty, it remains the most attention-grabbing series opener (apart from the original series') the franchise has had. The first year may have relied on a few too many familiar faces--like Picard, Q, and Lwaxana Troi--but these were more than outweighed by refreshingly detailed explorations of cultures old and new (Trill, Bajoran, Cardassian, Ferengi). As it turned out,Deep Space Ninewas the boldest venture into Roddenberry's galaxy that had been (or ever would be) seen.--Paul Tonks", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008972H", "B00008KA5A", "B00008KGT0", "B00008KA59", "B00008KA58", "B00008KA57", "B000127LW2", "B0001NBNFW", "B0002JP4GE", "B0007TKH66", "B00062IDCO", "B00BHWG0CM", "B00BHWG0DQ", "B000228EBS", "B0002WZTCA", "B00062IDLA", "B000063V8T", "B0009I7NGW", "B000063V8R", "B000AOEMXC", "B000063V8S", "B00005Y1NF", "B000A6CLL0", "B000062XFG", "B00BHWG1AI", "B00BHWG0G8", "B002BAW6FE", "B001DHXT3Y", "B000VDDDY6", "B0017VG69U", "B002BAW6FY", "B000HEWEJ4", "B002BAW6GI", "B002I9Z8GM", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B00L4K3MLE", "B002BAW6GS", "B00K2CHWYI", "B002BAW6H2", "B00062IDDS", "B000AOEMXM", "6305181721", "B00IURL19Y", "B0019N95IK", "B00IWTVDUW", "B0083TUEHY", "B002I9Z8I0", "B002I9Z8EO", "B00GTZWZH6", "B000B8IA2G", "B002GP7ZV4", "B00062RCC6", "B000F8O2Q0", "B003H9LIRK", "B003ZFC9M4", "B00AZMFJYA", "B000BOH98G", "B0095XPZBC", "B00IO998U2", "B00243FQFA", "B000RZIGVS", "0671501062", "145169590X", "1451650744", "B00FFEM0W2", "B0081QF6Q8", "B00B5ARKC0", "B00IWTVDXO", "B007AFC0W4", "1451650701", "B004EXWGHY", "146540337X", "B001DHXT6G", "B000BOH8Z0", "B00CYQXHLC", "B000F8O2OM", "B002GP7ZVO", "B004HYW84G", "B001RHGRTS", "B000LC4ZI0", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B000BOH8Y6", "B000BOH986", "B00BARLSVC", "B00HETWFVC", "B00402FGE4", "B000BOH990", "B000P5FH44", "B0006FO9B0", "B005DEUEV8", "B00BD6K54G", "B002I9Z8BM", "B001DF681G", "B003H9LIU2", "B004TJ1H3C", "B00CKYHH6O", "B007USE5CE", "B00JPS6A3O", "B000CNE0T2", "B004XM38CS"], "bought_together": ["B00008972H", "B00008KA5A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00062RCC6", "B00008972H", "B0007TKH66", "B00008KA5A"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 28247}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 32.99, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B00005JLF5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FY7AHCEiL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek Deep Space Nine - The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "An enormously entertaining (if somewhat shallow) affair from blockbuster   director Steven Spielberg. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Frank Abagnale,  Jr., a  dazzling young con man who spent four years impersonating an  airline pilot, a  doctor, and a lawyer--all before he turned 21. All the  while he's pursued by a  dedicated FBI agent named Carl Hanratty (Tom  Hanks), whose dogged determination  stays one step behind Abagnale's  spontaneous wits. Both DiCaprio and Hanks turn  in enjoyable  performances and the movie has a bouncy rhythm that keeps it  zipping  along. However, it never gets under the surface of Frank's drive to lose   himself in other identities, other than a simplistic desire to please  his father  (Christopher Walken, excellent as always), nor does it  explore the complex  mechanics of fraud with any depth.

{"description": "It's not that the folks at Pixar are geniuses when it comes to DVDs... well, come to think of it, their fifth DVD set shows these folks are wizards. It's not just that the two discs are packed with watchable extras that hardly reiterate the same information; it's how they are handled--funny, inventive, with a light touch--unlike many PR-driven discs. A good place to start is the filmmakers' jolly commentary track, which branches off into 31 minutes of behind-the-scene stuff, deleted scenes, and curious anecdotes (they can also be watched separately). Pixar's first making-of documentary is a most concise and interesting 25-minute examination that also sheds light on how the company works. With a digital-to-digital transfer, the film looks great and is available in widescreen or reformatted to full screen. The \"Family Fun\" disc includes another Pixar made-for-the-DVD gem, the 7-minute \"Exploring the Reef\" with Jean-Michel Cousteau (Jacques's son) being upstaged by Dori and Marlin; it's a hoot and teaches a fact or two you will remember about reefs. Both discs feature lovely menus that can be turned into virtual aquariums for your TV (by removing the text) featuring the knockout colors of the film's settings. Watch long enough for some shenanigans from the film's characters and vocal talent. Genius, pure genius.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00EV1YZ96", "B00AFEX83C", "B00007LVCM", "B00005JNS0", "B0030IIZ4M", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B003ZHVJGO", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00003CXB4", "B001KVZ6FW", "B0013FSL3E", "B004HO6I4M", "B00005JN4W", "B000MV9026", "B004G600A4", "B000AY74OG", "B000VBJEEG", "B0006UEVT0", "B008YWY0HK", "B003H9M1Q2", "B00CQRN3QI", "B0001I561E", "B0042U94UQ", "B00E9ZATJO", "B000YERP2S", "B0006JMLRK", "B000AAF1TU", "B0000AOX0O", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00F522C7C", "B0039N74CW", "B00003CXCQ", "B001ILFUDC", "B00275EHJG", "B001HN6922", "0736429220", "B000B8QG4A", "B000RMJ4F8", "B0084IHVN4", "B002ZG97YM", "B001ECQ75A", "B004ZBACOE", "B0030IIYYS", "B0084IHVGG", "B00E9ZATKI", "B00AO686JC", "B000GUJZ00", "B00004R99S", "B0012EM5D8", "B0084IHVUC", "B0013ND30M", "B0034JKZ86", "B0000VV4W2", "B00003CX8Y", "B008JFUQ16", "B001DPHDCY", "B00005TN8K", "B00CUDD0C0", "B00A83075M", "B001O5LVPI", "B001NCDFTW", "B00G7TIKMI", "B0000E32WJ", "B00CWM58WY", "B001ILFUD2", "B00009YXAW", "B00CMY3JBO", "B00335EQ0E", "B005LAIISA", "0783231474", "B0002YLCOM", "B00E00OGE2", "B000H7JCK0", "B000UVKGPI", "B00005JMQZ", "B00JK531ES", "B00004U9WQ", "B005LAIH4A", "B005LAIHW2", "B00024I2Z4", "B00I6JOD2S", "B008NNY9QW", "B0000VCZKM", "B00FE8BVF6", "6302526574", "B004EPZ034", "B000L22SG6", "B001OMU6UM", "B00E56D8FO", "B0000524D0", "B002WJI2QQ", "B0009CTT6U", "B000050MN3", "B000B8QG3G", "B0058AFS0O", "B00006FDAI", "B00EGIAQ1K", "B000A7G4TY"], "bought_together": ["B00EV1YZ96", "B00G5G7EXY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00EV1YZ96", "B00AFEX83C", "B00I6JOD2S", "B004HO6I4M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7746}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 25.5, "brand": "Disney", "asin": "B00005JM02", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-difUGanL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "There's only one deleted scene in this two-disc DVD set, but it's a doozy. The \"Sgt. Candy Scene\" is a must-see and, unfortunately, the best thing on the second disc. The rushed HBO documentary shows us far more flash than substance. Better is the Visual Effects Lab that goes more in-depth with four sequences, although you need to wade through a hokey interface for each segment. Making your \"own\" effects isn't that much fun; you can only choose a few effects that change in two scenes. Anyone looking to get the complicated backstory of the trilogy figured out should dig into the \"Sky Net Database\" and an intricate timeline. The two commentary tracks are worth a listen, with director Jonathan Mostow's solo track the better one. The director goes into great detail on how the little things (from lighting street scenes to tricks for destroying buildings) count.  The second track is pieced together from the actors recorded separately. Mostow appears with actress Claire Danes (doing her first commentary track) and their chemistry is enjoyable after a slow start. The other actors have less interesting things to say, including Schwarzenegger who is constantly--yet enthusiastically--selling the film.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5", "B001FB55HQ", "B00005JA8B", "B00070FX5U", "B00007AJG4", "B002ZG98LO", "B000T9OP7G", "B002GHHHME", "B00005JKIP", "B002QFYJFY", "B0002J58HO", "B0000AXE8I", "B001AQO43M", "B00AKGG828", "B00026ZG10", "B0001BKAEY", "B00IZZDWKM", "B001451HXO", "B0000VCZK2", "B000056PMU", "B000BPL2FQ", "B000RW3VCK", "B0004Z33F0", "B000U1ZV8K", "B0045HCJGC", "B0004Z33EQ", "B00005JNTU", "B000HRMAPE", "B00008G8M4", "B000RRS7RE", "B00005JKYX", "B0000VD12I", "B000FC2FQA", "B00000ILDG", "B00000G3PA", "B00005JMZK", "B000MGBSE4", "B0087ZG7J8", "B0004Z33EG", "B000P0J0AQ", "B00005JMEW", "B0087ZG7NO", "B00003CXTA", "B0002CHK1S", "B000RJO56E", "B00177YA1K", "B00004STDN", "B005COLETU", "B001AK3S4Y", "B000VNMMR0", "B0000959N0", "B00005JMUA", "1558908846", "6305767866", "B001RIY4WE", "B0049IHX2C", "B000VI70QS", "B000EGDB10", "B002GSXKN8", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B0045HCJ9O", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00005JNJV", "B001451HX4", "B00I9TDMRM", "B0006GANOQ", "B00003CXSP", "6305428115", "B00016MSV2", "B00005JOC9", "B000TJBN80", "B009MO57H6", "B000O77SQS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B001OST0M6", "B005LAIHXQ", "B0002J4X1Q", "B0002V7OI8", "B0015XHP2C", "6304806434", "B000QXDED6", "B00005JL3K", "B008JFUPFI", "B003PIUINS", "0783225946", "0792839056", "B00005N7Z1", "B0006GAO6I", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00005JL78", "B001HN697M", "B00IJS2OXG", "B002NXSRVG", "B00008G8M5", "B00005JN0T", "B003XURDAY", "B000O77SRM", "B006VRRGNK", "B00F4FFO8E"], "bought_together": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5", "B001FB55HQ", "B002JT6AO0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 115564}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.47, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JM0B", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5143TFPX8SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "More sex. More violence. That's what you get in the unrated director's cut ofTaking Lives, which ought to tell you where director D.J. Caruso's priorities lie. The hot scenes between Angelina Jolie and Ethan Hawke are extended (offering a bit more nudity for Jolie's lecherous fans), and the fate of Gena Rowlands's character isconsiderablymore graphic, but none of the added footage makes the movie any better or worse. That said, this cynical director's cut is the only version worth buying if you're looking to fill out your serial-killer-thriller collection (or your movies-in-which-Jolie-gets-naked collection), and you might as well enjoy the gag reel outtakes because they contain the only footage on the entire DVD in which Jolie cracks a genuine smile. The four featurettes are really just one standard-issue promo reel chopped into thematic categories with a pretentiousCSIvibe, and while they offer little of substance, seasoned film buffs will welcome the appearance of veteran British editor Anne V.

{"description": "Even though it's only a single disc, the28 Days LaterDVD includes a lot of very interesting features, including the alternate ending that was shown after the end of the film a couple months into its theatrical run.  It's much bleaker, as director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland say in their optional commentary.  Another alternate ending is almost the same as the theatrical ending but slightly less happy.  Most interesting is the \"radical\" alternate ending that takes an entirely different path midway through the film.  It wasn't filmed, however, so Boyle and Garland narrate the action over storyboards, and it's a surprisingly engrossing 11 minutes.  Boyle and Garland also did a commentary track for the film, and they talk about how they were able to get the shots of deserted London and why they used the ending they did.  There are also six very watchable deleted scenes, and Boyle and Garland's comments range from \"great sequence\" to \"a disgrace.\" Slightly less relevant is a 24-minute documentary that spends its first 10 minutes on the real-life threat of infectious diseases before recapping the film and discussing such elements as the use of digital video and the boot camp the actors had to attend. If you need any further proof that the DVD was a labor of love, even the stills galleries have commentaries.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000TJBN80", "B0002ABURA", "B0006A9FKA", "B002WY65VU", "B00111YM5Q", "B0013D8LAE", "B000IHY9TS", "B000Y7U98C", "B00005JO16", "B0021L8UXA", "B0001611DI", "B0013D8LA4", "B000RJO56O", "B002JT69IW", "B001D2WU9I", "B002VWNIDG", "B0002CHK1S", "B00D7AM6M0", "B003UGLCIA", "B00AEFYYH6", "B001MVYUR0", "B000UAE7O0", "B003EYVXYG", "B000EHRVP6", "B0028DRGDQ", "B0021L8UPS", "B001NPD9LS", "B005LAIIMG", "B000FAOC2W", "B000LP6KNU", "B0006SSOHC", "B000WC3864", "B0013FDM7E", "B00000K3TO", "B000RIWAVW", "B000GCFO0I", "B000O76ZQC", "B004LWZW24", "B000RJO578", "B002VKB0KG", "B006ISJR7U", "B00004TS0G", "B004SIP9MY", "B002VKE1K2", "B00G5GNYY2", "B000N6TX1I", "B0024FADD8", "B005QUQRBU", "B001MYIXAC", "B00D3DJIG8", "B001GUYB08", "B000TGJ80S", "B000V4UFZK", "B004SIP92O", "B00009MGEM", "B0010X73ZG", "B00005K3NR", "B002LMSWN2", "B000063RQQ", "B00000ILDD", "B004BZ5AN2", "0767802519", "B00001QGUM", "B00AJLHUA8", "B002SJIO4A", "B00005JMUA", "B00J5LXT6M", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B000AXWHSA", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00005JLWN", "B004BLJQOK", "B0015ET3YO", "B008220BLG", "B000031WD9", "B000069HZP", "B000EQ5SRK", "B0007Y08QA", "B000PMLJMQ", "B000BUNZY2", "B002ZG98UA", "B000V4UH08", "B001JNNDJM", "B003HKN52U", "B003UAKEBW", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0019X3YX2", "B00CE00ZV8", "B00003CXCF", "B0009WFEDC", "B000FS9FE4", "B00005JNJV", "B00011CZRE", "B002T9H2LA", "B000RW5BZ0", "B00005JMXX", "B000WC389G", "B007STBUHI", "B002ZG983M"], "bought_together": ["B000TJBN80", "B002WY65VU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008SAPC20", "B003J42JLC", "B000Y7U98C", "B0002ABURA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 37382}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.25, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00005JMA8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511KHM89SFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "28 Days Later (Widescreen Special Edition)"}

{"description": "Like a good dream, Sofia Coppola'sLost in Translationenvelops you with an aura of fantastic light, moody sound, head-turning love, and a feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, even though you've probably never been to this neon-fused version of Tokyo. Certainly Bob Harris has not. The 50-ish actor has signed on for big money shooting whiskey ads instead of doing something good for his career or his long-distance family. Jetlagged, helplessly lost with his Japanese-speaking director, and out of sync with the metropolis, Harris (Bill Murray, never better) befriends the married but lovelorn 25-year-old Charlotte (played with heaps of poise by 18-year-old Scarlett Johansson). Even before her photographer husband all but abandons her, she is adrift like Harris but in a total entrapment of youth. How Charlotte and Bill discover they are soul mates will be cherished for years to come. Written and directed by Coppola (The Virgin Suicides), the film is far more atmospheric than plot-driven: we whiz through Tokyo parties, karaoke bars, and odd nightlife, always ending up in the impossibly posh hotel where the two are staying. The wisps of bittersweet loneliness of Bill and Charlotte are handled smartly and romantically, but unlike modern studio films, this isn't a May-November fling film. Surely and steadily, the film ends on a much-talked-about grace note, which may burn some, yet awards film lovers who \"always had Paris\" with another cinematic destination of the heart.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305428239", "B0007UC8Y4", "B000BX8R10", "B00005JMJG", "B0000640VJ", "B0010X8NF0", "B003UESJLU", "B007L6VR12", "0767821408", "B00007AJF8", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00DW5IKYS", "B001QOGYBI", "B000M06KJ8", "B00005JLRE", "B00000G02H", "B0006TPE4C", "B0007TKOAA", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00DYVUBYM", "B00H9HZITU", "B000Z8GZYW", "B004SEUIXS", "B00AEFXN9G", "B003CRM6PA", "B00008RH3J", "B000EQHXNW", "B0001I1K32", "B0008JIJ2O", "B001DJ7PR8", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0009PVZD2", "B000CS464G", "B00337KM2S", "B003102JDM", "0790734796", "B001P3SA8K", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B0000WN0SC", "B00003CWTI", "B00003CXZ4", "B00008975Z", "B0057ZAA6W", "B000IU37SO", "B00004RJ73", "B00AEFXGIY", "B007P9HW3M", "B005MYEQ4U", "B000K7VHQE", "B00005JNC2", "B00079Z9VO", "B000063JDE", "B0001US61O", "B0000WN15O", "B00G7QPXUI", "B0041KKYEM", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00006LPGP", "B0006H32EI", "B00005JKJA", "B00AEFYCL4", "B000KX0IOK", "B002T9H2LA", "B001TOD92C", "B004XVMCKS", "B00AEBB9CS", "B008220DGE", "0767802519", "B000069HYF", "B007D5E7C2", "B000M7XRAG", "B004U7MR14", "B003O7I6SE", "B000A7DVR2", "B005LAIIJY", "B00A81MV3U", "B000055Y0X", "B00005V9HH", "B000E33VWW", "0783225903", "B00AEFXE9U", "B000N6TX1I", "B00CIOD6HK", "B0021L8UOY", "B004SIP95G", "B000PAAJZ6", "B002ZG980U", "B007UW9WOQ", "B00GKOJ98E", "B0014D5RBE", "B00011CZRE", "B001HN699A", "B000M4RG7E", "B003ELKNH2", "0767802535", "B00121QGPY", "B004FQX5B6", "6305609764", "B0009A40ES"], "bought_together": ["B0007UC8Y4", "6305428239"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00JAQJMJ0", "B007L6VR12", "B001QOGYBI", "B0010X8NF0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2901}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.77, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JMJ4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518vLN4%2B7KL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lost in Translation"}

{"description": "In the DVD world, the Criterion Collection label generally indicates that you'll be getting your money's worth on the extras, andThe Life Aquatic with Steve Zissouis no exception. These two discs contain many features that fans of the film will expect: Seu Jorge performing David Bowie songs (complete versions), many documentary scenes of writer-director Wes Anderson at work, interviews with cast members including Cate Blanchett, Bill Murray, etc. Other extras are a little more confusing. For instance, does Seymour Cassel, who plays Zissou's deceased partner, know what he's doing when he complains to a hairless cigar merchant about having to go faux bald? And what's the deal withMondo Monda? It's a cringingly awkward Italian talk show in which the host (also an actor in the film) interviews the screenwriters, throwing out references so random and esoteric that even smart guys like Anderson and Noah Baumbach are left speechless. It's all a joke, right? In the end, the bonus material accomplishes its primary goal: get those who already enjoy the film to like it just a little bit more.--Leah Weathersby", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0010X8NF0", "6305428239", "B0000640VJ", "0767821408", "B007L6VR12", "B001QOGYBI", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B007L6VR6M", "B000CS464G", "B0006TPE4C", "081099741X", "B00005JMJ4", "B000934FC2", "B0035G5IOE", "B00JAQJNN0", "B00005JMJG", "B000BRD6T4", "B0045NXMJE", "B00007AJF8", "B00H9HZITU", "B0018BD9DA", "B004SEUIXS", "1623160510", "B001P3SA8K", "B000JMK6LW", "B0018O4YT0", "B001MM3AZM", "B0006H32EI", "B002E2M5IC", "B0012E2GFK", "B000M4RG7E", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000Y7U98C", "B001NPD9PY", "B00IJXJAIS", "B000A7DVR2", "B008MIMWP8", "B004FQX5B6", "B00GKOJ98E", "0783228457", "B000K7VHOG", "B002LMV7RA", "B00008RH3J", "B0009A40ES", "B00DL46ZN8", "0957490909", "B000F5GNX8", "B00005JLRE", "B00006AUIH", "B00005V9HH", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B001JIE7JM", "B000IU37SO", "B004RQDQIQ", "B00AEBB8SS", "B00006LPGP", "B00000K3TS", "B00H9L28OO", "B007D5E7C2", "B000065AI3", "B0033WH6MW", "B008220D5K", "B0014D5RBE", "B001BPJJ9G", "B00005JL78", "B007D0FVRM", "B00AEFYOJE", "B00003CXZ4", "6304493681", "B0083V2W4U", "B000Z8GZYW", "B008R65XNS", "0783229526", "B00HGGUTPW", "B003UESJMO", "B005HK13SG", "B000P0J0EW", "B002VWNIAY", "B000P0J0D8", "B004SIP7ZS", "B001HN69AY", "B003XURDAY", "B00H7KJRVY", "B00ECR7KX2", "B001GMAVGE", "B005LAIIJY", "B000055Y0X", "B0000AC8LR", "B000K7VHQE", "B00AEFYAMA", "6305922756", "B0041T52S6", "B009YQJ322", "B003CRM6PA", "B002T9H2LA", "B000O76ZQC", "B0040QYROA", "B005MYEQ4U", "B00I6JOD2S", "B00FZ4KR4U"], "bought_together": ["B0010X8NF0", "B0000640VJ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00JAQJMJ0", "B0010X8NF0", "B007L6VR12", "B0000640VJ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 72305}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.5, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JNLQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H5Q2VBE1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (The Criterion Collection)"}
{"description": "The delightful designs of William Joyce (writer/illustrator of such popular children's books asGeorge ShrinksandBently & Egg) makeRobotsa joy to behold. The round, bouncy, and ramshackle forms of hero Rodney Copperbottom and his computer-animated friends are part of an ornate and daffyFender providing assistance.Rube-Goldberg universe of elaborate contraptions and gleaming metallic surfaces.  Rodney (voiced with a hint-of-Scottish lilt by Ewan McGregor) is a young inventor who sets off for Robot City to work for Big Weld (Mel Brooks), the supreme inventor of the mechanical world.  But upon his arrival, Rodney discovers that Big Weld has disappeared, and the slick, shiny Ratchet (Greg Kinnear,As Good As It Gets) is phasing out the spare parts that lumpen robots need to function and replacing them with \"upgrades\"--expensive and glistening new exoskeletons. Unfortunately, from this suitable beginning, the story degenerates into a series of action sequences that make very little sense, though some are kinetic and fun (though others are only there to serve the inevitableRobotsvideo game). Most kids will enjoy the sheer visual pleasure of the movie, but compared to the narrative richness of Pixar movies likeThe IncrediblesandToy Story, that pleasure is pretty short-lived. Also featuring the voices of Robin Williams, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Amanda Bynes, Jennifer Coolidge, and many, many more.--Bret FetzerDVD FeaturesJennifer Coolidge returns as the voice of Aunt Fanny in a mildly amusing new short, \"Aunt Fanny's Tour of Booty,\" which allows her to again be the butt of the joke.  Fans of the characters will enjoy both a 17-minute discussion of the robots' creation as well as profiles of 11 of the bots, including early, almost unrecognizable conceptual sketches and brief interviews with the voice cast.  The original short is fairly dull, and of the three deleted scenes, the most finished is an extended version of Rodney's initial meeting with Tim at the gate.  One other is in sketch form only but does preserve another performance by Robin Williams.  The kids' games are pretty good.  There's a dancing robot that will perform eight routines on command or in random order.  A memory game has a bit of replay value, and the build-a-bot segment takes some thought and investigation.  The Xbox demo is a nifty little diversion that transforms one element (the transport-pod race) of the full-length, single-player Xbox game into a frenetic one- to four-player free-for-all.In their commentary track, director Chris Wedge and producer-inspiration William Joyce have to remind each other to stop patting themselves on the back, but it is interesting to hear them talk about old games such as Mousetrap that played a part in developing the film.  (Wedge's frequent references to a possible \"director's cut\" might not seem like a joke to DVD buyers who have gotten tired of DVD rereleases.)  The commentary track by the Blue Sky technical team might be better, offering insights into the characters and the creation of the film without lapsing into too much techie-speak.--David HoriuchiStills fromRobots(click for larger image)The World ofRobotsThe Art of RobotsRobotssoundtrackRobotsscoreRobotsfor XboxRobotsfor PS2Robotsfor GBA", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006JMLRK", "B000M343BC", "B002WJI2QQ", "B001DPHDCY", "B0012EM5D8", "B004HO6I4M", "B00003CXJ4", "B00CWM58WY", "B000MV9026", "B0006UEVT0", "B001GCUO7A", "0783231474", "B005SDUV4E", "B000RMJ4F8", "B0000640SC", "B000ROAK2W", "B0013FSL3E", "B001LPWGFA", "B004EPZ034", "B001U3D88M", "B000ION23A", "B005LAIISA", "B0000AOX0O", "B000UFIYOO", "B001PR0YEE", "6305161887", "B00029LO0Y", "B008NNY9QW", "B000G75AZC", "B000H7JCK0", "B006JD48LO", "B000L22SG6", "B00B7EQPNE", "B001ECQ75A", "B004AKCME8", "B000AY74OG", "B000VBJEEG", "B00F522C7C", "B000DWMYQ8", "B002ZG97YM", "B008JFUQ16", "B004LWZW7Y", "B000BITUVG", "B0000VV4W2", "B005LAIH4A", "B00003CXG7", "B00005JMQZ", "B00007LVCM", "B0042U94UQ", "B00CHVJODE", "B001PR0Y7Q", "B00E9ZATJO", "B00009M9BK", "0449810798", "B0090SI1RM", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B001KVZ6FW", "1620575175", "B009AMAH3O", "B00I6JOD2S", "B000CZ0PT4", "B0013FSWT2", "B0034G4OYA", "B00AFEX83C", "B000UVKGPI", "B000065V42", "B0039N74CW", "B00JK531ES", "B00HLTD2OE", "B002ZG9904", "B00009YXAW", "6305123454", "B005FLSZQU", "B00005JM7T", "B001GCUNWQ", "B003UESJF6", "B00E00OGE2", "B001HN6918", "B000GUJZ00", "B00I0VTOMG", "B00005JNS0", "B00365F6I2", "B000EQ5UHS", "B000LPS2VI", "B00005JN4W", "B000B8QFYG", "B001NCDFTW", "B0030ZIZRC", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00G5G7EXY", "B007FF3HQM", "B00947N6D8", "B00EBBGLFC", "B005QODEEE", "B00ALMNCLQ", "B00362RUX4", "B00005JN0T", "B000GIXEWC", "B00005TN8K", "B005LAIIT4"], "bought_together": ["B00CWM58WY", "B004HO6I4M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00CWM58WY", "B004HO6I4M", "B002WJI2QQ", "B001DPHDCY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3335}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "Fox Home Entertainment", "asin": "B00005JNQS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61RM90ARRPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Robots (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "More than a few critics hailedSpider-Man 2as \"the best superhero movie ever,\" and there's no compelling reason to argue--thanks to a bigger budget, better special effects, and a dynamic, character-driven plot, it's a notch aboveSpider-Manin terms of emotional depth and rich comic-book sensibility.Ordinary PeopleOscar-winner Alvin Sargent received screenplay credit, and celebrated author and comic-book expert Michael Chabon worked on the story, but it's director Sam Raimi's affinity for the material that bringsSpidey 2to vivid life. When a fusion experiment goes terribly wrong, a brilliant physicist (Alfred Molina) is turned into Spidey's newest nemesis, the deranged, mechanically tentacled \"Doctor Octopus,\" obsessed with completing his experiment and killing Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) in the process. Even more compelling is Peter Parker's urgent dilemma: continue his burdensome, lonely life of crime-fighting as Spider-Man, or pursue love and happiness with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst)? Molina's outstanding as a tragic villain controlled by his own invention, and the action sequences are nothing less than breathtaking, but the real success ofSpider-Man 2is its sense of priorities. With all of Hollywood's biggest and best toys at his disposal, Raimi and his writers stay true to the Marvel mythology, honoringSpider-Mancreators Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, and setting the bar impressively high for the challenge ofSpider-Man 3.--Jeff ShannonDVD Features:The first commentary track is by director Sam Raimi and a self-deprecating Tobey Maguire speaking in tandem, and producer (and Marvel CEO) Avi Arad and coproducer Grant Curtis speaking in tandem. They discuss a number of topics, including Raimi's memory of his excitement over Richard Donner's Superman and how the character of Black Cat had to be dropped from the film. The second commentary is by six members of the Oscar-nominated effects team, and one of their primary focuses is how Doc Ock's arms were achieved by a combination of puppetry and CGI.The centerpiece of the second disc is a massive two-hour documentary that can be viewed all at once or in 12 separate pieces. It covers the development of the story, the visual effects, costumes, stunts, and sound and music. Three shorter featurettes cover Peter Parker's struggle between his personal and hero lives, Doc Ock, and the women in Spider-Man's life, and what's interesting is how they discuss those topics not just in relation to the movies but to the comic books as well. (For example, Betty Brant and Gwen Stacy had a much greater impact in the comics.) There's a scene in which you can toggle among three different camera angles, and a gallery of 17 paintings Alex Ross created for the opening sequence. The sound and picture are spectacular, though only theSuperbit editionhas DTS.--David HoriuchiMore Spiderman on DVDTheSpidermanToy StoreThe First FilmSpider Manon the small screenThe SoundtrackGame Boy AdvanceThe BookMore Superheroes on DVDBatmanBladeThe HulkJimmy NeutronJustice LeagueKim PossibleRobocopSpider-ManSupermanWonder WomanX-MenAlso see our Action & Adventure StoreStills fromSpider-Man 2(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000UR9T8C", "B00005JKCH", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00005JNTU", "B000VI70QS", "B001CDR1FG", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000AYELVA", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000AYELVU", "B008JFUO72", "B0083SBMBM", "B004LWZW42", "B004EPZ07K", "B00005JNJV", "B0002IQMAM", "B00E5I2MEK", "B000OVLBF8", "B00E5I2M9K", "B000HEVZ9E", "B008QZ5PY2", "B000HCO83Q", "B00JPS7HOA", "B001QB9H1U", "B00IGVJGYQ", "B0000959N0", "B0007P0Y7C", "B002GSXKN8", "B008JFUPFI", "B000J10EQU", "B0007V6ITE", "B0090SI56Y", "B001GZ6QC4", "6307397594", "B008JFUS0U", "B000IJ79VQ", "B000VR0570", "B002ZG99B8", "B00005JKWJ", "B004LWZWGA", "B005G4TJUC", "B002IPFWTE", "B00005JM5E", "B005LAIGW8", "0767817478", "B000H30B2C", "B002A5EBLW", "B0006L0LOS", "B000U7WV1Y", "B0000VCZLG", "B000P0J06K", "B002GSXKNI", "B002HWRYJE", "B0004Z33EQ", "B0009A409S", "B001DJLD2G", "B000I0RQVI", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B0007RT9MG", "B001GKJ2E8", "B0000AXE8I", "B007K3JFUQ", "B00004STUL", "B00BEZTMFY", "B000P0J06U", "B000957O82", "1402778007", "B0039N74CW", "B003UESJF6", "B00F4FFO8E", "B001HN697M", "B001OST0LW", "B0060FXDCG", "B0049IHX2C", "B000P0J0A6", "B000CEVC9M", "B000UVKGPI", "B009JBWOU0", "B00005JM5B", "B00I6JOD2S", "B001EDVNNU", "B000O77SRC", "B0000633UA", "B000P6XQ50", "B000E8M0VA", "B00008G8M4", "B000EGDB10", "B007REV4T8", "B00BPA2PEI", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B005OY6LBE", "0780624890", "B002935GMS", "0767803434", "6305428042", "B000O78KW4", "B009HIKAN8"], "bought_together": ["B000UR9T8C", "B00005JKCH"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004LWZWFQ", "B003YAR97K", "B00005JKCH", "B000UR9T8C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9593}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.0, "brand": "Marvel Kids", "asin": "B00005JMQW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51529JJX43L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Spider-Man 2 (Widescreen Special Edition)"}
{"description": "March of the Penguinsinstantly qualifies as a wildlife classic, taking its place among other extraordinary films likeMicrocosmosandWinged Migration. French filmmaker Luc Jacquet and his devoted crew endured a full year of extreme conditions in Antarctica to capture the life cycle of Emperor penguins on film, and their diligence is evident in every striking frame of this 80-minute documentary. Narrated in soothing tones by Morgan Freeman, the film focuses on a colony of hundreds of Emperors as they return, in a single-file march of 70 miles or more, to their frozen breeding ground, far inland from the oceans where they thrive. At times dramatic, suspenseful, mischievous and just plain funny, the film conveys the intensity of the penguins' breeding cycle, and their treacherous task of protecting eggs and hatchlings in temperatures as low as 128 degrees below zero. There is some brief mating-ritual violence and sad moments of loss, butMarch of the Penguinsremains family-friendly throughout, and kids especially will enjoy the Antarctic blue-ice vistas and the playful, waddling appeal of the penguins, who can be slapstick clumsy or magnificently graceful, depending on the circumstances. A marvel of wildlife cinematography, this unique film offers a front-row seat to these amazing creatures, balancing just enough scientific information with the entertaining visuals.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B000BI5KV0", "B000BI5KUQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BI5KV0", "B008MIL45M", "B000BI5KUQ", "B00HR3D56O"]}, "price": 27.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JOFZ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51W4YDJTQJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "March of the Penguins"}

{"description": "Helen Mirren reigns supreme inThe Queen, a witty and ingenious look at a moment that rocked the house of Windsor:  the week that followed the sudden death of Princess Diana in 1997. Diana's death came at just the same time that Prime Minister Tony Blair (played by the bright Michael Sheen) was settling into his new government--and trying to figure out the delicate relationship between 10 Downing Street and Queen Elizabeth II (Mirren). A large portion of the British population was trying to figure out the Windsors that week, as Elizabeth remained stiff-upper-lip and largely mum about the death of the beloved princess. In Peter Morgan's skillful script, we watch as Blair grows increasingly impatient with the Royals, who are sequestered in their Scottish estate while the public demands some show of grief. Prince Philip (James Cromwell, in good form) clumsily decides to take Diana's sons hunting, while a sympathetically-treated Prince Charles (Alex Jennings) displays some frustration with his mother's eerie calm.None of this conveys how funny the film is, or how deftly it flows from one scene to the next. Director Stephen Frears (Dirty Pretty Things) deserves great credit for that, and for the performances, and for the movie's marvelous sense of well-roundedness; you could see this movie and groan at the cluelessness of the Royals and their outmoded existence, or you might just sympathize with showing reserve in a world that values gross public displays of emotion. But either way, you'll marvel at Mirren, who makes the Queen far more alert and human than one might ever have imagined.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B003UESJH4", "B001C4AFOY", "B004M9QNVK", "B004GXKBDI", "B0059XTUVI", "B000Z8H0IC", "B000ZOXDFA", "B000RF7XYO", "B001L57ZZG", "B001TH92N4", "B000BKDNX0", "B0006Q93H4", "B000EOTELI", "B004XYOQU4", "B009TT0BSE", "B0012QE4Q2", "B001QUF3SW", "B007HW8U2Y", "B000EHQUGC", "B00342ANSA", "B004SIP9U6", "B000V02CNW", "B00005O7N8", "B00GM7STPI", "B003N9ASF2", "B002ZG99EK", "B004SIP71M", "B003Y5H4Y8", "B0001I55M4", "B001AZIRVI", "B00015HXDG", "B000E1NXJ0", "B000RF7XYY", "B00121QGPY", "B009AMANBA", "B000M06KJ8", "B000MEYJHY", "B00005JOFQ", "B007TBJUVI", "B0085A9JXG", "B003AND1SM", "B000NIVJF4", "B0010X73Z6", "B000K7VHQE", "B00005JKNF", "B000MCH5P4", "B001TR4G6W", "B004P7CNZO", "B0050PYNN0", "B000GH3CR0", "B00AEFY8MM", "B0068MNO4S", "B002RSDW80", "B001MVWFAO", "B004ZNFTDQ", "B000255LIY", "B000V6LSOA", "B00ARX2VZW", "B000G6BM0K", "B008220C38"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003UESJH4", "B004M9QNVK", "B001C4AFOY", "B004GXKBDI"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPAM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K34G0GCBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Queen"}
{"description": "This two-disc collector's edition ofPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chestis packed with over five hours of special features that delve into everything from creating the mythology-inspired Davy Jones and Kraken figures, to working and planning without a completed script, the incredible CGI techniques used in the film, the intense sword training sessions and stunt work, and the unpredictability of filming on location in the Caribbean. The audio commentary by writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio is an interesting and insightful look into the finished film, but perhaps even more revealing is the 25-minute \"Charting the Return\" preproduction diary in which everyone from producer Jerry Bruckheimer to associate director Peter Kohn and writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio give a sense of the enormity of the project of concurrently writing and filming two sequels toPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. The overwhelming logistics of planning and casting without a finished script, scouting and preparing remote locations, constructing a new Black Pearl, and functional props like the rolling water wheel, and cutting costs to stay within budget are nothing less than mind-boggling. In the hourlong \"According to Plan\" feature, director Gore Verbinski, producer Jerry Bruckheimer, and a host of others detail the enormity of the project, focusing on the stamina involved in a 200-day shooting schedule and the need for adaptability and flexibility in dealing with everything from behind schedule excavations to the logistics of shooting on moving water and even the natural fury of a full-blown hurricane.  Shorter featurettes \"Meet Davy Jones: Anatomy of a Legend\" and \"Creating the Kraken\" focus on the mythological creatures in the film and the awesome visual effects and advances in CGI technology that made them possible.  \"Mastering the Blade\" follows Orlando Bloom (Will Turner), Keira Knightley (Elizabeth Swann), and Jack Davenport (Norrington) through some intense sword-fighting training sessions and \"Fly on the Set: The Bone Cage\" offers a frightening look at what it was like to shoot the bone cage scene of the movie.  Other bonus features include bloopers, an interactive tour of Johnny Depp's special makeup effects and wardrobe details, a look at how the 1967 Disney Land Pirates of the Caribbean ride was recently \"re-imagineered\" to incorporate some of the characters and elements from the new movies, producer Jerry Bruckheimer's photo diary, and a glimpse of the glitzy June 24, 2006 red carpet premiere on Disney Land's main street.--Tami Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JM5E", "B005COPWZW", "B004A8ZWUQ", "B0013BM63O", "B00005JN5E", "B004M1A21K", "B004DTLK80", "B000VR0570", "B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY", "B00005JKCH", "B001HN694K", "B00005JPH2", "B00AEFYGBA", "B00BEZTMFY", "B001HQZJMU", "B00E5I2M6I", "B006VRRGNK", "B001BEK8HO", "B000E8M0VA", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B001E75QH0", "B008QE9XD2", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00LG6YEKE", "B00AEBBA72", "B007K3JFUQ", "B000HRMAPE", "B0090SI56Y", "B000E6EK2Y", "B0053FANRC", "B00005JMQW", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B00177YA1K", "B001TK80C0", "B000UR9T8C", "B00003CXI1", "B004EPYZUS", "B00003CXTA", "B001OQCV6A", "B0014Z4ON4", "B005G4TJUC", "B000F7CECK", "B00HFFE8HE", "B001GCUO1Q", "B0087ZG7J8", "B003YAR97K", "B008JFUNTG", "B001GCUO0W", "B000NIBURQ", "B0053FANPY", "B00023B1LC", "B003QO8TOQ", "B002VPE1BQ", "B00F84H73Q", "B003Y5H54W", "B00003CWT6", "B00007AJGH", "B00E5I2M9K", "B000W7F5SS", "B0049IHX2C", "B00000IRE6", "B001F7MSFM", "B000AYELVA", "B002ZG9904", "B000VWYJ86", "B00CFA222M", "B003UYUQZW", "B008UZ949K", "B0002KVUKM", "B000209KMW", "B000UVKGPI", "B0087ZG7HK", "B0000WN140", "B001EZE5BU", "B002PMV9FG", "B000HT386M", "B000NQRR1Q", "B00003CXZ1", "630529142X", "B0002ZDVEU", "B004A8ZWSS", "B00005JM5B", "B000BTITKS", "B00E5I2MEK", "B002HWRYJE", "B001GZ6QC4", "B000W796OM", "B00AQSN7HE", "B0046BI81W", "B001VLBDD0", "B0060FXDCG", "B0084IG8TM", "B005OCFGTO", "B000OLGCIE", "B008JFUS0U", "B00007AJG4", "B009JBWOU0", "B001B3LIOC"], "bought_together": ["B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JM5E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005COPWZW", "B00005JM5E", "B0071JADFU", "B00005JPFX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 72898}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 16.95, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JP0F", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GQE7TQ72L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "Leonardo DiCaprio puts a handsome face on an ugly industry: In parts of Africa, diamond mining fuels civil warfare, killing thousands of innocents and drafting preteen children as vicious soldiers. DiCaprio (The Departed) plays Danny Archer, a white African soldier-turned-diamond-smuggler who gets wind of a large raw jewel found by Solomon Vandy, a native fisherman (Djimon Hounsou,In America) recently escaped from enslavement by a brutal rebel leader. Archer offers a deal: He'll help Vandy find his war-scattered family if Vandy will share the diamond with him. Drawn into this web of exploitation is journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly,Little Children), who agrees to help if Archer will tell her the details of how conflict diamonds make their way into the hands of the corporations who sell them to the Western world. DiCaprio is compelling because he never flinches from Archer's utter ruthlessness; Archer ends up doing the morally justifiable thing, but only because his desperate greed has led him to it. Hounsou and Connelly, though saddled with all the moral and political speeches, rise above the cant and keep the movie's treacherously formulaic plot rooted in human characters. But in the end, the story won't stick with you as much as the dead stillness in the child soldiers' eyes; the horror of African civil strife refuses to be contained byBlood Diamond's uplifting message--and the movie is all the more potent as a result.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001N44BVQ", "B000M341QE", "B00005JLSB", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00080ZG10", "B004SIP7TE", "B006OFN0SE", "B002ZG980U", "B000NIVJF4", "B0007R4T3U", "B0016Q2D66", "B00049QQHI", "B001EZE5DI", "B00003CWM3", "B00008DP4C", "6305268827", "B000BYA5G4", "B00AEBB9F0", "B000Y7WGOW", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000065U1N", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000095WW8", "B000U7169M", "B00DHHWXYY", "B000GFLKF8", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002O3Z510", "B002VWNIEA", "B002ZG99N6", "B0007DFJ0G", "B005LAIIJY", "0792839137", "B000KP62SE", "B000P0J0EW", "B000P0J09M", "B007SPPANM", "B00004XPPG", "B000C20VPA", "B00011CZRE", "B002QEHPQU", "B00005JN2Z", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00003CXWV", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00001ZWUS", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00005JN0W", "B002T9H2LA", "B000MTEFXC", "B003L20IG0", "B00AEBB86A", "B00005JKBC", "B0013XZ2QK", "B0000ACOXL", "B005LAIGRS", "B002AT8K9W", "B0007KIFGE", "B00AZNEW5G", "B003ASLJO0", "B000T28PII", "B002DU39GW", "B002ZG97RE", "B000LC55F2", "B00003CXTG", "B00AEBBA36", "B00B0U2SFE", "B003ASLJQI", "B002CPMB9O", "B00BB67UNW", "B000MXPE7O", "0783231202", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00AEFXVCU", "B00AEFXRRO", "B000A3XY5A", "B002JCSWV6", "B00005JNQA", "B004EPYZP8", "B0050MB4OO", "B000P0J0AG", "B000C65Z1G", "B00275EGWY", "B00005B6JZ", "B0006GANPA", "B00AEBB9NM", "B002XMGGK6", "B000C20VRS", "B0007P0XBO", "B003UESJME", "B000QXDED6", "B00AHTYI5M", "B001P9KR8U", "B004A8ZX28", "B008JFUNKU", "B003ASLJQS", "B002VWNICC", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00005BCKF", "B000NOIX48"], "bought_together": ["B000M341QE", "B002ZG980U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBB8NI", "B00H9KKGTO", "B008MILL8W", "B000BYA5G4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 106777}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.96, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JPGO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61MN8-6skUL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blood Diamond (Two-Disc Special Edition)"}
{"description": "The supplemental features onTMNTare a decidedly mixed bag: Viewers are offered a great deal of extras, but all run far too short to prove particularly useful to serious Turtle fans. The deleted and extended scenes will undoubtedly be the chief feature of interest, but the alternate opening and ending, as well as several other clips are presented only in early test form (\"Roof Top Workout\" is presented in storyboard form and then in pre-visualized form). Also, one cannot view the deleted/extended scenes without hearing commentary by director Kevin Munroe (who also provides an informative if somewhat dry feature-length commentary track). Having said that, some of these scenes (most notably \"Splinter Gets Cake\") do stand on their own, and might have helped to enliven the theatrical version of the finished film. Also included is a brief featurette comprised of interviews with the voice talent cast, and \"Donny's Digital Data Files\" explores the CGI design for the characters and their environment; again, their brief running times (the info-heavy \"Donny\" clocks in at less than two minutes) will render them somewhat extraneous to hardcore Turtles devotees. The Internet Reel is a promotional collection of clips from the film, while trailers for several other kid-friendly Warner Bros. and Hanna-Barbera films and DVD collections (Fred Claus,The Last Mimzy,Birdman and The Galaxy Trio) round out the sorta-special features.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000696I1", "B0000696I0", "6304698739", "B00AEVXGFG", "B0001FVDG4", "B003Q7B742", "B00CD45J9S", "B0007NFMCG", "B00DTRR3XS", "B00H7BJ1XC", "B000EHSVG4", "B000BQ7J9I", "B0087AOYCU", "B003PIUIJ2", "B00L4K450G", "B0081DECO8", "B00DY09BE4", "630016411X", "0307980715", "B0000VV3U0", "B000G1R39Y", "B008BM2LJ2", "B00DWXV074", "0449817652", "B005335K7W", "B0030E5PYY", "B000S6LP50", "B00DHUV1US", "B008DBZBUC", "B008DBZBS4", "B002D755BW", "B0000AGWP0", "B00DO2J8CC", "B00BT289I8", "B000M2E3FO", "B008132JES", "B001U7NVZ8", "B00F4MB1OI", "0307980707", "B008O6Q7D6", "B008DBZBV6", "B000MRAZ3I", "B00GO9GXUC", "B008DBZC9W", "B008O6Q8H6", "B00DJY7MD2", "B00AEFZ06A", "B00DV5ZE2U", "B00CUB6OIE", "B008DBZC8I", "B00DM2LGVU", "B00AEFY8FO", "B001ECQ75A", "1450819729", "B008DBZC8S", "B00CBZU3M2", "B0096EG2P8", "B004DOTKDM", "B0089BSOGO", "B00ENR17TY", "B002WJI2QQ", "B00CBOU3QO", "B000065V42", "B004GJYROG", "B00BESSXPG", "B00A8HOYQQ", "B00BG34F0G", "B00DWXV1DM", "B00A88DQWI", "B008O6Q7TK", "0449818268", "B00006FDN0", "B000CEXFZG", "B00DWXV07E", "B00B5A1GPM", "B0081N08X2", "B000M4H6RE", "B00ITAQ2MS", "B00CMDPTUY", "B00CUB6TZM", "B00DWI7JVK", "B00DSB5RU6", "B00DWI8SDI", "B00I6JOD2S", "B00GD9GNEY", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B0000AYK1R", "B000FZETRU", "B00CC6URB2", "B00AEFY5TI", "B00AEFXMSS", "B00B76ZWX6", "B00CUB6TVQ", "B000BITUVG", "B008DBZC92", "0767839277", "B008DBZC88"], "bought_together": ["6304698739", "B0000696I0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003PIUIJ2", "B0000VV3U0", "6304698739", "B0001FVDG4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14368}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.84, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JPMZ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51iO8U9tnZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "TMNT"}
{"description": "One of the first things a viewer notices aboutCloverfieldis that it doesn't play by ordinary storytelling rules, making this intriguing horror film as much a novelty as an event. Told from the vertiginous point-of-view of a camcorder-wielding group of friends,Cloverfieldbegins like a primetime television soap opera about young Manhattanites coping with changes in their personal lives. Rob (Michael Stahl-David) is leaving New York to take an executive job at a company in Japan. At his goodbye party in a crowded loft, Rob&#x92;s brother Jason (Mike Vogel) hands a camcorder to best friend Hud (T.J. Miller), who proceeds to tape the proceedings over old footage of Rob&#x92;s ex-girlfriend, Beth (Odette Yustman)--images shot during happy times in that now-defunct relationship. Naturally, Beth shows up at the party with a new beau, bumming Rob out completely. Just before one's eyes glaze over from all this heartbreaking stuff (captured by Hud, who's something of a doofus, in laughably shaky camerawork), the unexpected happens: New York is suddenly under attack from a Godzilla-like monster stomping through midtown and destroying everything and everybody in sight. Rob and company hit the streets, but rather than run with other evacuees, they head toward the center of the storm so that Rob can rescue an injured Beth. There are casualties along the way, but the journey into fear is fascinating and immediate if emotionally remote--a consequence of seeing these proceedings through the singular, subjective perspective of a camcorder and of a story that intentionally leaves major questions unanswered: Who or what is this monster? Where did it come from? The lack of a backstory, and spare views of the marauding creature, are clever ways by producer J.J. Abrams and director Matt Reeves to keep an audience focused exclusively on what&#x92;s on the screen.  But it also makesCloverfieldcuriously uninvolving. Ultimately,Cloverfield, with its spectacular effects brilliantly woven into a home-video look, is a celebration of infinite possibilities in this age of accessible, digital media.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B004EPYZQ2", "B00IO9D3ZI", "B00EMMDMKM", "B002SJIO5E", "B0044ZOI32", "B001AR0D4A", "B004BZ5AMS", "B001MVYUQQ", "B003BJO8KU", "B0018AG6X6", "B005LAIGPU", "B00IO8VMB6", "B000PKG8SS", "B003Y5H5GU", "B00BPA2PGG", "B0017U7PT6", "B001YV502C", "B0013FBS20", "B008JFUR10", "B001KZVQJI", "B001CW7ZW6", "B0035WTJFW", "B000Y7U98W", "B003ABZGRI", "B000VDDWEC", "B000VDDWEM", "B002JT69IM", "B00164EAC8", "B002ZG981E", "B00AEFXORM", "B001DZOC3W", "B008SAPC20", "B003Y5H59M", "B00HERVMTK", "B00AVSFIV2", "B0032KNA4I", "B000L212HW", "B001FB55I0", "B0018O4YSQ", "B002ZG997M", "B002ZG9788", "B008G33O0G", "B000VDDWE2", "B00K2CHVSK", "B001GCUO5W", "B005J4TLQG", "B000PC6A3E", "B0027VT9ES", "B001F7MSG6", "B0051T46XM", "B00111YM60", "B001GZ6QEC", "B002HR1W1K", "B004SIPA4G", "B001OQCVII", "B001JNNDBA", "B001GKJ2FC", "B000WQWPKA", "B000OT6V00", "B0021L8UXK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004EPYZQ2", "B00IO8VMB6", "B004LWZW4W", "B005LAIHY0"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPXY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Wm5GO98oL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cloverfield [Theatrical Release]"}

{"description": "The 14-minute featurette \"Behind the Book: The Themes ofBridge to Terabithia\" discusses such topics as friendship and family as presented in both the book and the movie through interviews with the young lead actors, the book's author, Katherine Paterson, and several librarians and school teachers. Paterson and her son, producer-screenwriter David Paterson, also recall how an actual incident in David's life inspired the book. A six-minute visual-effects featurette looks at the film's creatures from sketch to computer design to screen, including how the features of the school kids helped shape the creatures. Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb, \"chaperoned\" by producer Lauren Levine, recount their experiences on one commentary track, while the second, by director Gabor Csupo, writer Jeff Stockwell, and producer Hal Lieberman, is drier but informative. Topics covered include praise for young Bailee Madison, how Zooey Deschanel wouldn't have been considered a predator back in the '70s, and the somewhat-controversial marketing campaign that focused heavily on the film's fantasy elements. Also included is Robb's music video for \"Keep Your Eyes Wide Open.\"--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB8KQ", "B00009XUM5", "B0009NZ2KG", "0060734019", "B00005JLOT", "B001NPD9JA", "B001APZMJS", "B0016Q2D5M", "B00AEFYIQ8", "B000E8M0VA", "B000Q66FB6", "B00005JPH2", "B000DBHX4M", "B0012IWO0I", "B0000VCZKW", "B00139W3NE", "B007R6DJP8", "B00005JG6M", "B000E6ES9E", "0064401847", "B003TNS3HC", "B001LPWGBO", "1557344019", "B00HR34TBE", "B004M1A21K", "B00005JMCW", "B007IU8YY4", "B00437IEI6", "B000GB5MH4", "B00ECW9U6M", "B00979KQFO", "B00BIYQPJC", "B000AM4P9A", "B0002S64VO", "B000J10FLY", "B00128VA76", "B000T9D6FS", "B003NHRIVQ", "1557344086", "B002GIBVV6", "B0050VDN76", "B000QUU7KW", "6305865612", "B000031EGV", "B0087F7VSY", "B000FFJYB6", "B000065V42", "B0009I7NGM", "B00AEBBA2M", "B002NZK5SW", "B000P0J09W", "B00AEFY8FO", "B0000633U5", "B0021L8URG", "B000AP04GK", "B000ION23A", "B002935GMS", "B004AKCME8", "B000G1R394", "1557344159", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00005TPMM", "0440414806", "B004SIP75S", "B0009JE57G", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B004NTDF5Q", "B003RHZ6IE", "B00005JNY3", "B0000YTP02", "B00005JMFH", "B003L4Y5BW", "B004A8ZX3C", "B001GC9VK6", "B00005RRG7", "B004SIPA9Q", "B000056T4I", "B001GCUO7A", "6305428042", "B008JFUS5A", "0312369816", "B001DDBD5E", "B000F2BNW2", "B000BJ7BCK", "B0001A79EO", "B001OQCV1K", "B005F96UJ6", "B0006J28MI", "0385736061", "B004QL7K16", "B0000AM6IY", "B0000AC8LI", "B0001I562I", "B003ZHR6TS", "B000NA28I4", "B00005JPO4"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBB8KQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBB8KQ", "B000E8M0VA", "0060734019", "B00005JPH2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 83708}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JPL5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VaImU5H0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bridge to Terabithia (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "You know you're going to get a different kind of superhero when you cast Robert Downey Jr. in the lead role. AndIron Manis different, in welcome ways. Cleverly updated from Marvel Comics' longstanding series,Iron Manputs billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (that's Downey) in the path of some Middle Eastern terrorists; in a brilliantly paced section, Stark invents an indestructible suit that allows him to escape. If the rest of the movie never quite hits that precise rhythm again, it nevertheless offers plenty of pleasure, as the renewed Stark swears off his past as a weapons manufacturer, develops his new Iron Man suit, and puzzles both his business partner (Jeff Bridges in great form) and executive assistant (Gwyneth Paltrow). Director Jon Favreau geeks out in fun ways with the hardware, but never lets it overpower the movie, and there's always a goofy one-liner or a slapstick pratfall around to break the tension. As for Downey, he doesn't get to jitterbug around too much in his improv way, but he brings enough of his unpredictable personality to keep the thing fresh. And listen up, hardcore Marvel mavens: even if you know the Stan Lee cameo is coming, you won't be able to guess it until it's on the screen. It all builds to a splendid final scene, with a concluding line delivery by Downey that just feels absolutely right.--Robert HortonStills fromIron Man(Click for larger image)&nbsp;", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00E5I2M6I", "B008JFUO72", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00E5I2MEK", "B0083SBMBM", "B008JFUS0U", "B001CDR1FG", "B00E5I2MAO", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001GCUO1Q", "B008JFUPFI", "B000VI70QS", "B000HEVZ9E", "B0000959N0", "B00005JKCH", "B00005JNJV", "B00005JNTU", "B0090SI56Y", "B000VR0570", "B00005JMQW", "B002HWRYJE", "B0007P0Y7C", "B004LWZW42", "B00D7OMNXS", "B001OQCV6A", "B007K3JFUQ", "B004EPZ07K", "B004LWZWGA", "B000UR9T8C", "B0083SBJXS", "B0060FXDCG", "B002IPFWTE", "B00E5I2ME0", "B00IXD2MGQ", "B000AYELVA", "B00C6B8TB8", "B008QZ5PY2", "B000OVLBF8", "B000AYELVU", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001QB9H1U", "B009JBWOU0", "B001AK3S4Y", "B001GZ6QC4", "B005G4TJUC", "B002NXSRVG", "B000HCO83Q", "B003YOZNBU", "B003Q6D2B4", "B00023B1LC", "B0002IQMAM", "B008JFURII", "B00HERGM86", "B00E5I2MDQ", "B006VRRGNK", "B002ZG99QS", "B00000JQB5", "B007REV4T8", "B00008G8M5", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B0002ZDVEU", "6305718954", "B001DTPZNY", "B005LAIGW8", "B001F7MSFM", "B001GCUNWQ", "B00A2H9P98", "B000RW3VDE", "B002O5M4T4", "B00005JA8B", "B005LAIIPS", "B005LAII44", "B00BEIYHO2", "B000GUJZ00", "B00005N5S5", "B002SJIO4A", "B000VWYJ86", "B004EPZ0BG", "B0049IHX2C", "B00AEBBAEK", "B00005JM5E", "B008JFUOWM", "B000FS9FCG", "B00005PJ6N", "B00979KQFO", "B00AEFXKUI", "B002K0WBXW", "B0042U94UQ", "B004EPYZUS", "B008JFUQZ2", "B0084IG8TM", "B001DJLD1M", "B008JFUS5A", "B00006HBUJ", "B000J103OI", "B00F84H73Q", "B0087ZG7NO", "B000U1ZV8K"], "bought_together": ["B00E5I2M6I", "B008JFUO72"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008JFUO72", "B00E5I2M6I", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2MEK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12121}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "DOWNEY,ROBERT JR.", "asin": "B00005JPS8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515wjJQt2nL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Iron Man (Ultimate 2 Disc Edition)"}

{"description": "Here's hoping James Mangold's big, raucous, and ultrabloody remake of3:10 to Yumaleads some moviegoers to check outDelmer Daves's beautifully lean, half-century-old original. That classic Western spun a tale of captured outlaw Ben Wade (Glenn Ford)--deadly but disarmingly affable--and the small-time rancher and family man, Dan Evans (Van Heflin), desperate enough to accept the job of helping escort the badman to Yuma prison. Wade, knowing that his gang will be along at any moment to spring him, works at persuading the ultimately lone deputy to accept a bribe, turn his back on \"duty,\" and go home safe and rich to his family. That the outlaw has come to admire his captor intriguingly complicates the suspense.All of the above applies in the new3:10, but it takes a lot more huffing and puffing to get Wade (Russell Crowe this time) and Evans (Christian Bale) into position for the showdown. Mostly, more is less. To Mangold's credit, his movie doesn't traffic in facile irony or postmodern detachment; it aims to be a straight-up Western and deliver the excitement and charisma the genre's fans are starved for. But recognizing that contemporary viewers might be out of touch with the bedrock simplicity and strength of the genre--not to mention its code of honor--Mangold has supplied both Evans and Wade with a plethora of backstory and \"motivations.\" At the overblown action climax, the crossfire of personal agendas is almost as frenetic as the copious gunplay. (By that point the movie has killed more people than the Lincoln County War.)Best thing about the remake is Russell Crowe's Ben Wade, a Scripture-quoting career villain with an artist's eye and a curiously principled sense of whom and when to murder. As his second-in-command, Ben Foster fairly pirouettes at every opportunity to commit mayhem, and Peter Fonda contributes a fierce portrait of an old Wade adversary turned bounty hunter for the Pinkerton detective agency.--Richard T.

{"description": "For die-hard horror fans,The Hills Have Eyes 2is a knock-off remake/sequel that delivers a few queasy thrills. While it represents a minor improvement over the 1985 sequel to Wes Craven's 1977 original (you know, the one with the notorious \"canine flashback\"), it's yet another cookie-cutter exercise in death by stupidity, focusing its Aliens-in-the-desert plot on a scrappy, ill-tempered unit of National Guard soldiers who've been sent to investigate the first remake's hellish aftermath in the bomb-tested wastelands of Nevada. (Like its far-superior 2006 predecessor, this sequel was shot on location in Morocco.) Unfortunately these bickering recruits are an embarrassment to their inauthentic-looking uniforms, and their reckless inexperience (not to mention a tired, uninspired screenplay by Craven and his son Jonathan) makes them easy targets for the ravenous, irradiated mutants who dwell within a treacherous network of tunnels and caves. As the generically good-looking cast is reduced to a few terrorized survivors (which somehow doesn't stop costars Jessica Stroup and Daniella Alonso from looking like fashion models), music-video director Martin Weisz switches to auto-pilot in his dubious feature debut, serving up a basically plotless succession of grisly makeup FX by Howard Berger and his crack team of gore-mongers. The gross-out factor is sufficiently amusing (including one soldier pulled through a hole with one leg in the totally wrong direction), but even devoted horror connoisseurs will have to admit this is pretty lame stuff. --Jeff ShannonBeyondThe Hills Have Eyes 2AllHills Have EyesMoviesThe Hills Have Eyes: The BeginningWes Craven: The Art of HorrorStills fromThe Hills Have Eyes", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FAOC2W", "B005GT3X68", "B00005JMDZ", "B008G4T7W4", "B000TJBN62", "B000KJU1KK", "B002G1WPG8", "B00018D42W", "B000UJ48P4", "B000E8M0P6", "B002G1WPI6", "B000EHRVP6", "B005OK722U", "B000AM4P9K", "B00005RHGK", "B000VKL6Z2", "B00009MGEM", "B0000E2R6P", "B002YICNE2", "B000WC389G", "B00BM4Q4H6", "B000AXWHSA", "B0031U8OEK", "B002DKGWSE", "B004EI2NP4", "B001NPD9LS", "B0041KKYCY", "B008JFUNYG", "B001D2WU9I", "B004EPZ08O", "B0021L8UXA", "B002FICQFM", "B000RGN2JI", "B000GCFO0I", "B00CERJI5U", "B004AC6PV2", "B00006FI0R", "B000N3AW6G", "B00196UTEG", "B00111YM5Q", "B000I2J68M", "B003Q6D27S", "B002ZG971U", "B00AZTUUQK", "B00005UQ9W", "B000PMLJMQ", "B000FC2HS6", "B00C2R122Y", "B00005LC4Q", "B000MM0LIM", "B000IHY9TS", "B00A2H9L2E", "B000FS9FE4", "B001GCUO4S", "B000NO3DLG", "B0021L8UFI", "B0021L8UPS", "B000TJBN80", "B00DMUFXOS", "B002ZG98KK", "B00AIBZLVY", "B001L9EXUC", "B004P7CN7W", "B00AJLHUA8", "B002JT69IW", "B000RIWAVW", "B001KEHAEO", "B000A5045Q", "B0037E8HNI", "B0000VCZMK", "B00C7C00JU", "B0020PFYHC", "B00005JMA8", "B001JNNDJM", "B000LC3ID8", "B0002C4JJ4", "B001P3SA9Y", "B000XUUQQK", "B000CNER1S", "B003YF9PX6", "B002S0OB8M", "B003PIUINS", "B001MEJY8W", "B000099T3M", "B00BEIYGT8", "B00005JLKN", "B00B96TGQS", "B001QMCJ0U", "B0000AOX09", "B004LWZW24", "0780631684", "B001U0HBQA", "B00005JO16", "B008G33PIM", "B002AS45VK", "B000AA4JL6", "B00006FDBT", "B00CAATSME", "B00275EHFU"], "bought_together": ["B000FAOC2W", "B00005JMDZ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FAOC2W", "B000E8M0P6", "B005GT3X68", "B008BM5WQG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 74238}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.88, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00005JPLQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61Jte4gSODL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Hills Have Eyes 2 (Unrated Edition)"}

Trying to match the movie's scale, the DVD even boasts recipes.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002JUFPUE", "B00005JM7T", "B0002F6BRE", "B003NFM3JK", "B000068TR1", "B000AGTPUK", "B001DPHDBA", "B000UX798I", "6305609764", "B0007A0F4E", "B00004VVP9", "B001CO42J8", "B000VBIGD6", "B002MU4NN6", "B001CW8016", "B00447L4JG", "B000HEWEJO", "B000VBIGCW", "B005LAIH4A", "B000HT3PPG", "B000TJBN6W", "B001DPHDCY", "B0057FGCJQ", "B000OLGCIE", "B00004TS0E", "B003P3PQOO", "B000ATQYT2", "B00008N6NQ", "B000641D2Y", "B00008X5J7", "B0039N74CW", "B008Y1YKE4", "B002ZG9904", "6305428042", "B008UY8FI2", "0783235070", "B00005N7Z0", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B001DDBD5E", "B00AFEX83C", "B003YCIE68", "B000YABV7W", "B00979KPXW", "B0007Z9R5W", "B00G5G7EXY", "B000C3L27U", "B00AEFZ82Q", "B002CAWNHE", "B000R7G6KY", "B00004Z1GR", "B000VAHQVU", "B000BB1MI2", "B00DZP1BKK", "0394800796", "B00003CXCQ", "B00005JLR2", "B00AEFY5TI", "B001GCUO7A", "B00081912E", "B005LAIISA", "B001CO32FI", "B0042U94UQ", "B00EV1YZ96", "B004LWZW7Y", "B00003CXG7", "B0019KAQEU", "B00008G8M4", "B000XKW2WG", "B000HT3PLK", "B0006419KA", "B00365F6I2", "B008JFUQ16", "B0000AQS5D", "B005AU4QG4", "B001CTA1UM", "B007SPPANM", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B0000C8ROV", "B005F96UJ6", "B000085EF7", "B000209KMW", "B0000640SC", "B0013ND30M", "0780623746", "B004GJYROG", "B0087F7VSY", "B0030IIZ4M", "B00CQRN3QI", "B000BKJ762", "B000I0RQVI", "B000AAF1U4", "B000KJT8IG", "B000S0PLGA", "B0000B1O9K", "B00AEFYIQ8", "B00003CXB4"], "bought_together": ["B00005JM7T", "B00G5G7EXY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002JUFPUE", "B00005JM7T", "B00004VVP9", "B001DPHDCY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5434}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.99, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005LOUP", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51E5VAMACNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Suffering from a bad case of writer's block, author Jack Manfred (Clive Owen) sits in his London flat, staring at an empty computer screen and trying to find the words to narrate his meandering life. Reluctantly Jack accepts a job from his absentee father (Nicholas Ball) at a second-rate casino as a dealer, or croupier, a job he once held in South Africa. His immersion back into this world is intoxicating, thanks primarily to the power he holds over his nightly clientele. Jack is a straight arrow on the floor (unlike his coworkers) but the whisper of an inside-job robbery makes his life suddenly more intriguing, as do the women who begin to drift into his life: a fellow croupier (Kate Hardie) and an alluring gambler (Alex Kingston). Suddenly, Jack finds his own life is his best book material. There's something visceral about watching the world of gambling, and director Mike Hodges (who directed the originalGet Carter) taps into this allure; Jack's simple croupier tryout--handling cards and chips with skill and grace--is as captivating as most action scenes in big popcorn films.

{"description": "At the start of the most recent film from Chinese director Zhang Yimou (Raise the Red Lantern,Ju Dou,Shanghai Triad), a young man returns to his native village after the death of his father, the village's schoolteacher, who died while trying to raise money for a new schoolhouse. His body is in a neighboring town; the young man's mother insists that it be brought back on foot, lest his spirit not find his way home. From this starting point, the young man recounts the tale of his parents' courtship, which involved a red banner, mushroom dumplings, a colorful barrette, and a broken bowl.The Road Homeis beautifully filmed, particularly the luminous face of Zhang Ziyi (fromCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), whose performance is a heartrending portrait of hope and yearning.

{"description": "A female detective discovers the dark side of the world of contemporary literature in this unusual thriller from Australia. Mickey (Abbie Cornish) is a brash young female poet who is gaining a potent reputation for her powerful verse about love and sex. When she suddenly disappears, private detective Jill Fitzpatrick (Susie Porter) is hired to help find her. Jill doesn't know much about poetry, so she starts her investigation by tracking down Mickey's teacher and mentor, Diana (Kelly McGillis), to learn more about Mickey and the circles in which she traveled. Jill is a lesbian, and quickly finds herself strongly attracted to Diana; though Diana is married to Nick (Marton Csokas), she finds herself equally infatuated with Jill, and the two are soon having an affair. When Mickey is found murdered, her parents ask Jill to step up the investigation, and Jill digs deeper into the facts of Mickey's life -- learning the young woman was willing to sleep with nearly anyone who could advance her career. She also discovers that the two older male poets with whom Mickey had become involved are not at all eager to answer questions about her disappearance. The Monkey's Mask is based on a mystery novel written in verse form by Dorothy Porter; the novel became an international bestseller and the biggest-selling book of poetry published in Australia since World War II . ~ Mark Deming, Rovi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AFDN5Y0", "B00FKPJ3VM", "B008XAGN46", "B0000CDLBB", "B004BJMEO6", "B00002CGGH", "B000OVLC0W", "B00GPPXNIK", "B006M3M5FM", "B00004U104", "B00006RJ97", "B002SF9YTS", "B00EMAGCHE", "B00005QW5T", "B00827OWO8", "B000F7CEBG", "B005Q4CLKW", "B004N21KIC", "B0085E44W8", "B000J4QWIG", "B006Z7Z3VS", "B000SUKPL6", "B0001HAGSI", "B007ZQAKIE", "B004AYMY92", "B004AHAEV4", "B00011Y1QC", "B0038M61IC", "B00AEK9BKQ", "B000F3UA6Q", "B000062Y1E", "B00GRZPRB4", "B000A4T804", "B00023P4M4", "B000FSMEE2", "B000TLTCQI", "B004EI2NM2", "B000AM6OVW", "B00JDOQMH4", "B00CBG9SQS", "B009POCG0Y", "B009M4KTUG", "B00005OLBC", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B00004YKR3", "B0001932ZU", "B0006IIOF4", "B0031DRZEC", "1594482306", "B0039S3872", "B0016I0AKU", "B000JGWD5K", "B0006J27WO", "B0002KQNKE", "B004SEUJEG", "B000AQOHN0", "B00EMAGKNU", "B00AEFXZ76", "B0002KPIQY", "B009OCR2U6", "B001451HVG", "B0009WDVUA", "B000FWHW68", "B001T6OPB4", "B00ELE8D2I", "B0015I2S10", "B00004Y7JN", "B000F4RHBQ", "B000193318", "B004SIP86Q", "B001E2PQGG", "B0002ZDWVM", "B004SUDQC2", "B00EMAGK1W", "B00AEBB9UK", "B00005NRNS", "B00009Y3N1", "B008N0EWTY", "B00009QUH7", "076782170X", "B00009MEB8", "B00AY6PK5A", "B003M05KUA", "B0076ANKUY", "B008YRL6LI", "B0006Q948M", "B000TXPXAU", "B00006CXI7", "B000BGH29K", "B008CJ0KBU", "B009M4KSHK", "B0015XHQXU", "B001DJ7PSC", "B00DYZ80S2", "B0014D5R9G", "B003YYVSEG", "B00375LBKI", "B000QUEQ4K", "B006GB2T0G"], "bought_together": ["B0000CDLBB"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00GPPXNIK", "B0000CDLBB", "B00AFDN5Y0", "B008XAGN46"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 194167}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.94, "brand": "", "asin": "B0000639HI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TQYTHMEAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Monkey's Mask (2002)"}
{"description": "Max Keeble's junior high career is off to an inauspicious start: one bully chucks him in a dumpster, another tormenter takes his friends' money, the ice cream truck guy is after him, and the self-serving principal is after everyone who stands in the way of his budget-draining football field plans. But his family's sudden plans to relocate give him the moxie to stand up to his foes in a big way. This kid revenge fantasy results in gags like a squirrel in the principal's pants and a cafeteria-wide food fight. Of course, Max (Alex D. Linz) doesn't move, forcing him to take responsibility for his actions, or this wouldn't be a Disney film. The broad humor is clearly meant for preteens, but crude jokes, bullying, and sexual innuendo (thus the PG rating) make it inappropriate for younger kids, leaving it for the narrow age range of about 8 to 12.--Kimberly Heinrichs", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000069HZN", "6306010513", "B00009QG6G", "B00022FWTA", "B0007US7CG", "B001GC9VK6", "B000089771", "B00005JN0D", "B00005KAQJ", "B0007LXPBS", "B000068QPM", "B00005JKZM", "B00005JM9Q", "B00E1HIX66", "B000P0J0CO", "B0009DWL8W", "B00005JKVU", "B000J10FLY", "B00005V9I9", "B000JMK6OO", "B001JJMGIU", "B000324Y98", "B000059TCD", "B0007US7C6", "B00005JM4W", "B000BJ7BCK", "B00006SFL7", "B0006J28MI", "6305870179", "B000H5V8CW", "B000N4RARO", "B0007LXPB8", "B00009XUM5", "B000QXDEG8", "B0041KKYHY", "B0007LXPBI", "B000YGGNMO", "B000089778", "B00008L3U1", "B0019ESNGO", "B000085EF5", "B002ZG99M2", "B000803BQC", "B00AKGG6X4", "B0000DZTN8", "B0017TWV0U", "B00005JN0Z", "B001L4LC88", "B000FKP3XY", "1558908404", "6304711867", "B000056T4I", "6305320950", "B00004Z1GR", "B00008979O", "B00008977A", "B000640WHG", "B004SIPADM", "B001SXZ7T2", "B00008979B", "B004SIPAFK", "B001R3YRIU", "B0000DZTNB", "B000085EF7", "B00006HBUB", "B002A5EBMQ", "B0006OBPTA", "B004GJYRF0", "B000209KMW", "B00005T7H3", "B00005JMCW", "B000F48D5A", "B000AM4P9A", "B008H6GHHY", "0783235070", "B0021L8UT4", "B000035Z48", "B000089799", "B002935GMS", "B000065V42", "B00006AW63", "0783230494", "B0013ND3MK", "B0006D3HD8", "B00006LPHB", "B00AEFY7SW", "B000XKW2WG", "6305428387", "1558908412", "B00CEAXE7U", "B0001EFTH4", "B00008L3T3", "B00005JMZA", "B006JTS6XY", "B000065U37", "B0015RRNN4", "B00386F0D0", "B0007N1A36", "B0009NZ2XS"], "bought_together": ["B000069HZN", "B00009QG6G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000069HZN", "B00022FWTA", "B00009QG6G", "6306010513"]}, "price": 10.27, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 33103}, "asin": "B0000639HQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q5E5XAPTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Max Keeble's Big Move"}

On the CD of Kanno's  eclectic score, theCarmina Burana-esque theme song from the TV series  occurs near the end as \"Dance of Curse II.\" This nicely packaged set is for  hard-coreEscaflownefans, rather than general viewers.--Charles Solomon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002KLALC4", "B00441GYS8", "B00005V4XG", "B00000JL4L", "B00005V1XW", "6304493681", "B000AMJG4Y", "B000E5LF0K", "B00GS1JRPY", "B0084DVVTE", "B00HFC90TI", "B009AVC922", "B00KZJX8HS", "B000FILUL0", "B00014X8KO", "B001W79MBS", "B000767QTA", "B00003CXBK", "B000CEV3O6", "B000055XAA", "B00AUJH32E", "B001K98MLO", "B003NE8B6A", "B00102FF7U", "B0046H0I1O", "B0043988G2", "B00ENNBZ68", "B000FS2VZO", "B003VOVW7M", "B008D1RCKY", "B000066IXV", "B005W2BWEO", "B00II4S0K2", "B00005UW7E", "B001K98M4Q", "B004XC5LPA", "B005HVWVN6", "B001AYWYEA", "B004PHSTTS", "B001F2U700", "B005DEUF1C", "B0001EFTVA", "B000PWQPAC", "B0009P42S2", "B000089UBU", "B00HXEWHM0", "B000068OJ1", "B000063K2F", "B001D265RQ", "B008YRL7JE", "B00B40N2UK", "B00J49R1Y6", "B0028X6L1Y", "B0035RWG0M", "B001EL6EAO", "B001R7IGU6", "B008D1RCS6", "B00HXEWH5W", "B00HXEWDMY", "B0052W9UO8", "B004STBFL2", "B000TGCR3I", "B007V9ECWU", "B0028X6KZQ", "B001VBM0Z0", "B007NU53E8", "B000F6ZIFQ", "B007BMIGII", "B00BQ1DDUG", "B003VQO4W0", "B0030ZOYV8", "B004DMIIVO", "B005W2BWSA", "B007NU54BU", "B0053O8B0Y", "B0010358CQ", "B00CDV4R26", "B0007OY31G", "B007BMIG5G", "B001C4ZQEI", "B004EXNHO0", "B000VWYJ68", "B008NNY9V2", "B00ANDPGI0", "B006MWA92E", "B0051SFSAS", "B00HFC547A", "B00GS19OOS", "B007V9ECV6", "B008D1RCR2", "B0071LEPDE", "B003SPDS94", "B00HFC30A8", "B0071LEH14", "B00ENNUC9Y", "B003SPDSA8", "B000068OIY", "B0056KOCDA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002KLALC4", "B00ENNBZ68", "B00ENNO1E6", "B00441GYS8"]}, "price": 18.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 246471}, "asin": "B000066IXT", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41THBWTSCML._SX300_.jpg", "title": "Escaflowne - The Movie (Ultimate Edition 3-Disc Set)"}
{"description": "Farscape: The Best of Season Onecollects six episodes selected by series creator and executive producer Rockne S. O'Bannon. \"Premiere\" introduces American astronaut John Crichton (Ben Browder), who is flung into an interstellar prison escape on the other side of the universe and must ally himself with the colorful convicts: D'Argo, a hulking warrior with a fleshy Rastafarian mane; Zhaan, a blue-skinned priest of indeterminate age; fugitive Peacekeeper Aeryn; Rygel, a greedy and troll-like exiled king; and Pilot, the giant insect-like nerve center of their living ship, Moya. The title character of \"DNA Mad Scientist\" offers them a way home in exchange for a sample of their DNA... and one of Pilot's arms. In \"A Human Reaction,\" Crichton finally gets back to Earth, but with unfortunate results for the rest of Moya's crew. Leading toward the climax of the show's first season, \"Nerve\" and \"The Hidden Memory\" make for a bold two-parter in which Crichton is reunited with his Peacekeeper Tech girlfriend, Gilina, and emotions are strained as he infiltrates a Peacekeeper base to find a cure for Aeryn's wound. But the story's most important function is to introduce the dreaded Scorpius, who uses his Aurora Chair torture device to extract what he mistakenly believes is vital knowledge from Crichton. Finally, in \"Family Ties,\" the season ends on a tense cliffhanger as Rygel plots with Scorpius, Crais intervenes unexpectedly, Moya's child turns out to be something of a handful, and Crichton and D'Argo must take a desperate gamble.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002GP7ZVO", "B002GP7ZVY", "B002GP7ZW8", "B0006FO9B0", "B001DF681G", "B002BAW6FE", "B006LPHY6G", "B007AFC0W4", "B0010YSD7M", "B000JLTRHW", "B000B8IA2G", "B008R52LA2", "B000PMFRTC", "B001RHGRTS", "B000LC4ZI0", "B002BAW6GI", "B000RW3YYA", "B002CLKP00", "B00061QJSK", "B0017MO11O", "B0017MO10U", "B000F8O2Q0", "B000HEZEY6", "6303961614", "B00243FQFA", "B000AJJNFE", "B002BAW6FY", "B0000AQS0F", "B004HYW84G", "B002BAW6H2", "6302020190", "B004EXWGHY", "B000F8O2PG", "B000F8O2PQ", "B00F3L8P26", "B00F6WXPSQ", "B000F8O2OM", "B0009JE6FM", "B002BAW6GS", "B00402FGE4", "B000BNI90Y", "B003L77GWE", "B0007TKH66", "B006LPHY5C", "B004TJ1H3C", "B000E5N6B6", "B000BCCAEQ", "B000BOH986", "B000F8O2P6", "B002BWP2IK", "B004SMDJ9U", "B000BW7QWW", "B00005JLF5", "B000F8O2OW", "B00129W6LE", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B00022FWEU", "B00007AP31", "B001A7GOCA", "B00AZMFJYA", "B004X60QE2", "B0057FGD3Q", "B00404ME2E", "B002ZCY872", "B002U0KHME", "B00062IDEW", "B005PPMHO2", "B003BV8I7C", "B007XF0XVQ", "B000A6CLL0", "B000BOH98G", "B000AOEMXC", "B000SMNL92", "B000FJH5M2", "B000127LW2", "B001C4CI8U", "B004XM38CS", "B004X60QWO", "B00B5ARKC0", "B003H9LIRK", "B005CFC04W", "B000NTMA1U", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00005JM3A", "B000QUEQ4U", "B000ELL1QC", "B0009UV7FS", "B00BD6K54G", "B00D49YFAA", "B000EHSVKK", "B0009I7NGW", "B0051GOB2G", "B0015A5JVY", "B0032JTUX4", "B00064AFBE", "B001HUWQEA", "B001MT7ZIS", "B000PHX8RA", "B000FFJYBQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00F6WXPSQ", "B00E688AZE", "B0006FO9B0", "B0000AQS0F"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 191574}, "asin": "B000067IVT", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EAH5KV8KL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Farscape - The Best of Season One"}

{"description": "The new short film \"Scrat's Missing Adventure: Gone Nutty\" showcases the well-timed animation--strongly influenced by Chuck Jones's Road Runner-Wile E. Coyote shorts--that made that frantic little character so effective as a comic foil. It's interesting to compare the Oscar&#xAE;-winning short \"Bunny\" withIce Age. The viewer can see the Blue Sky artists developing the more angular and less detailed look that's become the studio's signature. Like Sid the Sloth, the title character in \"Bunny\" suggests a slightly frayed walk-around figure from a theme park; the texture of her coat anticipates the old-chenille-bathrobe look of Manny the Mammoth's pelt. The clips in different languages, trailers, directors' commentary, and making-of features feel rather standard, but listening to John Leguizamo experiment with different voices before settling on the exaggerated lisp for Sid offers an unusual and funny insight into the development of an animated character.--Charles Solomon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000GUJZ00", "B001GCUNWQ", "B005LAIISA", "B000MV9026", "B004HO6I4M", "B000AY74OG", "B001DPHDCY", "B002WJI2QQ", "B0006JMLRK", "B0012EM5D8", "B0000AOX0O", "B00CWM58WY", "B005QODEEE", "B0039N74CW", "B00005JNQS", "B00003CXJ4", "0783231474", "B001ECQ75A", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B0000640SC", "B001NCDFTW", "B004EPZ034", "B000M343BC", "B000RMJ4F8", "B0042U94UQ", "B00007LVCM", "B00AFEX83C", "B0000VV4W2", "B000UVKGPI", "B00005JMQZ", "B0013FSWT2", "B00G5G7EXY", "B008JFUQ16", "B002ZG97YM", "6305161887", "B0030IIZ4M", "B00005JNS0", "B0013FSL3E", "B005SDUV4E", "B00CHVJODE", "B00EBBGLFC", "B00EV1YZ96", "B001GCUO7A", "B005LAIHW2", "B00E9ZATJO", "B000056H26", "B00029LO0Y", "B000VBJEEG", "B006JD48LO", "B00F522C7C", "B005LAIH4A", "B003H9M1Q2", "B004G600A4", "B00005JM7T", "B005F96UJ6", "B00365F6I2", "B008YWY0HK", "B0030IIYYS", "B00JK531ES", "B00947N6D8", "B001OMU6UM", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B001ILFUD2", "B00000JL8E", "B000L22SG6", "B001GCUNW6", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00009YXAW", "B004LWZW7Y", "B001HN6918", "B003ZHVJGO", "B000065V42", "B00HLTD2OE", "B00275EHJG", "B00E00OGE2", "B00003CXB4", "B001HN6922", "B001U3D88M", "B002ZG9904", "B000H7JCK0", "B000AAF1TU", "B00005JMFH", "B001LPWGFA", "B008NNY9QW", "B009PPO78W", "B000LPS2VI", "B003E66Y84", "B00157OICI", "B003UESJF6", "B00003CXG7", "B001O5LVPI", "B000EQ5UHS", "B00028HBES", "B0000VCZKW", "B000ROAK2W", "B00ALMNCLQ", "B00I6JOD2S", "B000YERP2S", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00H5NY7NG"], "bought_together": ["B004HO6I4M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004HO6I4M", "B005LAIISA", "B00IEXX4KS", "B000MV9026"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 126280}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.07, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B00006CXHU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5150B79E6SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ice Age (2-Disc Special Edition)"}

{"description": "This first movie from the Discovery Channel favorite opens with a plot of international intrigue over a downed satellite, but within four minutes Steve Irwin is belly flopping after a baby croc on the outback floor. Steve and his nerves-of-steel sidekick wife, Terri, are asked to relocate a cattle-chomping crocodile before it's shot by a local rancher. This same reptile happened to swallow the intelligence-gathering device that fell to earth, and so begins the goofball premise of this lark of a movie. The feds believe the Irwins are appropriating their classified info, and the Irwins think they're running from poachers. Quibblers may object to Irwin's frequent interruptions to introduce a bird-eating spider or paw through croc dung, butCrocodile Hunterfans wouldn't have it any other way. This 89-minute film is rated PG for action violence/peril and mild language. But unless you consider \"crikey\" an obscenity, it's a safe bet for family viewing.

{"description": "Anyone who fantasizes about becoming a porn star should seePorn Star:  The Legend of Ron Jeremy, a cheerful documentary that paints a sympathetic  but clear-eyed portrait of the most successful male porn star of all time.  Through remarkably frank interviews with the man himself and a variety of  friends and associates (including actresses, rival actors, and directors; porn  moguls like Larry Flynt and Al Goldstein; and, most surprisingly, Jeremy's own  family), Ron Jeremy emerges as a likeable but self-obsessed guy whose insatiable  drive for fame and success is also a struggle to overcome loneliness and a lack  of self-worth. Not that anyone's going to feel too sorry for a man who gets paid  to have sex, but Jeremy's honesty and sense of humor deserve some respect. And  despite all the flesh on display,Porn Staris more matter-of-fact than  titillating, taking in its subject with a sociological distance.--Bret  Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000777I2O", "B00005UW9L", "B00007CVSO", "B0002I84I0", "B000FBFZ2C", "B000077VR2"], "bought_together": ["B000777I2O"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0060840838", "B00007JZXT"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 236381}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.99, "brand": "NEW VIDEO GROUP", "asin": "B00007JZXS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TP1MJMH6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Porn Star - The Legend of Ron Jeremy (Uncut &amp; Unrated Edition)"}
{"description": "This off-beat TV series aired as part of the anthologyAnime  Complex(1998). The titlemechais the \"god\" of the South Sea island  of Bauou. Early one morning, it rises out of Tokyo Bay in search of the  Shimabara Sisters, whose brother married the last princess of Bauou. These first  episodes spoofGodzilla, with Neo Ranga casually trampling big chunks of  Tokyo in its search. As the story progresses, the focus shifts to the sisters  (Minami, Yuuhi, and Ushio) and their nephew Joel as they attempt to lead  something approximating a normal life in Tokyo with an 18-metermechain  their front yard. Although the 15-minute length of the episodes restricts the  development of the story and characters, this very quirky series was the most  popular show to come out ofAnime Complex.

The set-up is completely absurd, but the collision of their efforts to woo and repel creates some pretty funny scenes.

{"description": "Depending on how you liked this romantic comedy, you just might find more laughs in the delightful banter between the director and his two stars on the commentary track. Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant join writer-director Marc Lawrence for a lively 102 minutes of conversation. Not much movie magic is discussed, but the three talents will sacrifice all for a good joke. It's best to watch the commentary track with the \"Two Bleeps Notice\" viewing option: when a heart appears on-screen, you can immediately view outtakes from that stage of the film. The flubs, on-set antics, and jokes are all guaranteed to bring a laugh. Other extras include two additional scenes (the wedding finale was judicially cut) and a HBO puff-piece on the making of the film. Yet the disc is a must-have for any fan of Bullock or Grant because it offers a chance to listen in on them; they're just as charming off-screen as on.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002K0WBXW", "6304765266", "B000023VTP", "B00005JPE3", "B000YDBPAM", "B00AEBB8NS", "B000HEWEE4", "0783235380", "B00003CXSM", "B0009OL7Z4", "B0000897EG", "B00AEBB8YW", "B0007PLLBU", "B0021L8UZS", "B00006ZXSO", "B00AEFY99O", "B0000AOV4I", "B004SIP9RO", "B004SIP8JI", "B00007E2F5", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B00008G7UF", "B00006ZXSQ", "B0038N9X3Q", "B001ECDVK4", "B00006FMUW", "B00005JPSM", "B002NZK5V4", "B002ZG989G", "B000MQC9H4", "B00066FB2A", "B000CEV3M8", "B00000JGHN", "B00005JN3W", "B00005JG6N", "B00005JL7Q", "B002SYAGNC", "B00004UEDQ", "B000CCBCAS", "B00081U7HC", "B0015I2RT8", "B00068GTK6", "B000NA1WE0", "B0006GANOQ", "B002ZG988M", "B00006ZXSN", "B00AEBB9WI", "B005XB8SRS", "6305213283", "B0045HCJJ4", "B002ZG9968", "B00E8RKHWW", "B004SEUJK0", "B00006ZXSL", "B000A343RI", "B00AKGG6JS", "B0006A9FIM", "B00005O5CM", "B00AEFXWXI", "6305236569", "B00008G6E8", "B00AEFXYOA", "B004EPZ070", "B002VECM6S", "B002P413IC", "B00AEFYWQY", "B000QGDY0G", "B003B3V0N4", "B0013D8LHC", "0780625277", "B003Y5H574", "B0000VD02Y", "0767811100", "B00164X59M", "6305736685", "B001AKTZW8", "B001WAKOW6", "B00EP2SN58", "B00EIBO8T6", "B000XJD33O", "B000BNX3B4", "B00006ZXSK", "B004SIP8LG", "B00005JM55", "0767821769", "B004SIP9VA", "B00AEFYSEA", "B0009KA2OA", "B001C5LLQ4", "B00164KYV4", "B002NZK5R8", "B002NZK5VO", "B002NZK5RS", "B000683VI4", "0800141660", "B0002Y121K", "B0071HPOGK", "B00AEFXKUI", "B00006ZXSI", "B003Y5H524"], "bought_together": ["B002K0WBXW", "6304765266"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002K0WBXW", "B004SIP9RO", "6304765266", "B000023VTP"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18204}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.56, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00008NRI7", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VJyiu%2ByUL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Two Weeks Notice (Full-Screen Edition) (Snap Case)"}
{"description": "Jack Bauer is having another one of his \"very bad days\" in the second season of the groundbreaking real-time thriller24. Once again the hours are ticking by with more guaranteed cliffhangers than a convention of mountain climbers. Holed up in a Los Angeles condo and estranged from his daughter, Jack is no longer on the government payroll; unfortunately for him, this small fact doesn't seem to matter to President David Palmer and the NSA, who call him back in to the CTU and give him 24 hours to infiltrate a terrorist organization that is planning to detonate a dirty bomb in the city of angels. All Jack wants is to get his daughter out of the city, unfortunately Kim's new employer, the abusive father of the child she is nannying, has other ideas.Fans of theoriginalwon't be disappointed, as there are more than enough shock moments in the first few hours to hint at the climactic build-up to come, while newcomers can quickly get involved in the lives of Jack and his family. There are some new characters to bolster the veteran cast and, interestingly (although not surprisingly), Jack's character has taken an altogether darker, more psychopathic turn. The danger the characters find themselves in also has a much more global, not to mention topical, impetus, grounded as it is in the war against terrorism.  Although the territory is more familiar this time around, this second season is just as much a high-tension, taut, adrenalin-fuelled ride as the first, and one that will have you glued to your TV for the next 24 hours.--Kristen Bowditch", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002XVQSU", "B000NDEXK2", "B000B837XI", "B000ICLRKC", "B000NDEXKW", "B000MR8W92", "B001L5SRJE", "B002ZCY7SW", "B001DMVZOE", "B0015QWZ8S", "B002ZCY7TG", "0756632277", "B0001WHXM0", "B00G4RCXPI", "B00KPP6ZLS", "B0000DIJNU", "B000FIMG68", "B000AJJNFE", "B00005JNOG", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B001OQCVFG", "B002N5N5QQ", "B00HT850YW", "B003FSTN52", "B000Q6GUW0", "B0049P1VHS", "B00ECHBSP8", "B004UXVDJA", "B0058YPJ2W", "B00J5LXT44", "B0044E9JU0", "B001GCUER0", "B00IWTVDUW", "B002ZCY8CC", "B0058YPGSY", "B0019L21GA", "B003L77GK6", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00HEPE6MM", "B0024FAR5M", "B00KPP6R9S", "B00005JOC9", "B004EXWGHY", "B00AIBZMD6", "B009LDD1H6", "B000P6YNSE", "B000EWBNMI", "B00ITAQ2T6", "B001AI776G", "B0036EH3XE", "B0089AD8IO", "B000YABIQ6", "B00FGEO9NE", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B009LDCZ7I", "B00IKM5LXG", "B000HEVZ9E", "B003F3NDWG", "B00AB65RUG", "B00HF98SJY", "B000BF0C8E", "B000BGR1B4", "B00E8OMZGG", "B00JA3RVG4"], "bought_together": ["B000NDEXK2", "B0002XVQSU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000NDEXK2", "B000ICLRKC", "B0002XVQSU", "B000MR8W92"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 4639}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 39.69, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B00008YGRU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516918NBNNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "24: Season 2"}

{"description": "When the Great Depression struck America in the 1920s finding work was hard, but if you were poor and black it was virtually impossible.Working as a porter for the Pullman Rail Company was an option, but it meant taking home a third as much as while employees and working some days for free. You could forget about being called by your real name--all black porters were simply called \"George\" after George Pullman, the first person to employ emancipated slaves.Asa Philip Randolph, a black journalist and educated socialist trying to establish a voice for these forgotten workers agrees to fight for the Pullman porters' cause and form the first black union in America.

{"description": "A hugely popular 1974 weekly TV series that's been completely restored for this collector's edition,Little House on the Prairieis based on Laura Ingalls Wilder's bestselling books and follows the Ingalls family through the trials and tribulations of pioneer life in the 1870s. The series opens with the extremely poor family settling in Plum Creek, near the town of Walnut Grove, Minnesota, and follows them as they struggle to build a house, plow and plant their land, and become part of their small town's community. Ma (Karen Grassle) and Pa (Michael Landon) are good, honest folk with a healthy compassion for others. But it seems like every day brings a new trial for them and their children, Mary, Laura, and Carrie (Melissa Sue Anderson, Melissa Gilbert, and Sidney and Lindsay Greenbush). A freak hailstorm ruins an entire crop of wheat, their newly born son dies, a bout of the plague threatens the entire town of Walnut Grove, the family's barn catches fire, a devastating blizzard looms, but the family perseveres and they never lose their faith in God or their belief in the goodness of each other and the people around them. Despite the hardships of everyday pioneer life, Pa and his family find plenty of time to help others. They come to the aid of a local girl suffering the effects of one leg being shorter than the other, Ma fills in for an ailing schoolteacher and inspires a previously unreachable pupil, and Ma and Pa band together to protect a young boy from harm at the hands of his drunken father. This series paints a striking picture of the difficulties of American pioneer life and the courage and resilience of pioneer men, women, and children. It's also a powerful portrait of a close-knit, giving family and the life-affirming lessons they learn and share each day. Michael Landon deserves much of the credit for the show's success as he filled the triple role of star, producer, and writer. Favorite episodes in season one include \"Country Girls,\" in which Mary and Laura attend their first-ever day of school; \"The Award,\" when Mary's studiousness leads to a fire in the family barn; the two-hour \"The Lord Is My Shepherd\" episode about the birth and death of young Charles Jr. and its profound effect on Laura; and \"Survival,\" in which a Native American friend saves the Ingalls family in a blizzard.

{"description": "Sixteen CandlesMolly Ringwald established herself as the teen queen of the '80s in this fresh comedy. The movie is a day in the life of Samantha, whose 16th birthday is turning out to be anything but sweet. All the traumas of teendom come down on one long day, which sees Samantha surrounded by dithery relatives, mooning over a high school hunk, and pursued by a sawed-off Lothario.Sixteen Candlesmarked the directing debut of John Hughes, and its goofy energy displayed a promising talent with a great ear for high school lingo ... a promise neglected since Hughes became, afterHome Alone, a one-man entertainment industry. There are some pretty crass moments (Why the stereotype of the foreign-exchange student from Asia?), but Ringwald's steady appeal smoothes over the rough spots. As the pubescent, self-styled lady-killer, Anthony Michael Hall turns in a hilarious portrait of a young swinger; he and Ringwald would reteam with Hughes forThe Breakfast Club, another key teen picture of the decade.--Robert HortonThe Breakfast ClubJohn Hughes's popular 1985 teen drama finds a diverse group of high school students--a jock (Emilio Estevez), a metalhead (Judd Nelson), a weirdo (Ally Sheedy), a princess (Molly Ringwald), and a nerd (Anthony Michael Hall)--sharing a Saturday in detention at their high school for one minor infraction or another. Over the course of a day, they talk through the social barriers that ordinarily keep them apart, and new alliances are born, though not without a lot of pain first. Hughes, who wrote and directed, is heavy on dialogue but he also thoughtfully refreshes the look of the film every few minutes with different settings and original viewpoints on action. The movie deals with such fundamentals as the human tendency toward bias and hurting the weak, and because the characters are caught somewhere between childhood and adulthood, it's easy to get emotionally involved in hope for their redemption. Preteen and teenage kids love this film, incidentally.--Tom KeoghWeird ScienceYes, that is Bill Paxton as Ilan Mitchell-Smith's militaristic big brother. And that's Robert Downey Jr. as one of the in-crowd jerks who makes nerds Mitchell-Smith and Hall's lives miserable. Fortunately, this is a John Hughes comedy and our smart nerds create the perfect woman, Lisa (Kelly LeBrock), using a computer and voodoo. Lisa is a willing sex toy, has magical powers, and just wants to help the boys get even and meet nice babes. She even cleans up. The fantasy ebullience of Hughes is given full rein here and that's good and bad (mostly good).

{"description": "It was a family affair in the second season of J.J. Abrams's wonderfully inventiveAlias, as super secret agent Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) came face-to-face with the mother of all super secret agents--herownmother, Irina Derevko (Lena Olin), a former KGB agent presumed dead but alive and more dangerous than ever. After shooting poor Syd, Irina later shows up at the doorstep of the CIA, offering to turn herself in and work for the good guys. But can she be trusted?Aliasset up so much duplicity in its second season that it might have been hard to keep track of who was doing what to whom, but thanks to a great ensemble cast, fast-paced writing and direction, and some cannily cast guest stars,Aliasrode a stunning emotional roller-coaster and never broke its momentum, even when halfway through the season, the show reinvented itself. With episode 13, \"Phase One\" (which aired after the Super Bowl to the show's biggest audience), Syd's original nemesis (and employer) SD-6 changes forever, yet the kick-butt agent still finds herself going up against the malevolent leader Sloane (Ron Rifkin) and his ever-changing set of henchmen. Action fans got plenty of fighting, while romanticAliaswatchers swooned as Syd and the dashing Vaughn (Michael Vartan) finally consummated their unrequited love.The critically acclaimed show owed a debt toBuffy the Vampire Slayerfor its mix of action, romance, mystery, and moral quandaries, but in this seasonAliastruly came into its own--with a climax that came as a total shocker and prepped the show for an emotionally volatile third season. Guest stars included the phenomenal Amy Irving as Sloane's wife, Faye Dunaway as a nefarious bigwig, Christian Slater as a kidnapped scientist, and Ethan Hawke as a fellow CIA agent (or rather, two of them), but it was the dysfunctional nuclear family of Syd, Irina, and father Jack (Victor Garber) that gaveAliasits heart and its strength, whether the three perfectly cast actors (all Emmy nominated) were just bickering or undertaking deadly hand-to-hand combat. And you thought your family had problems!--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001MVWRMK", "B001MVWRNE", "B001MVWRMU", "B001MVWRN4", "B0001I55ZQ", "B004SJU51I", "B00008ZL4Q", "B0047BXR8U", "B000O77SMW", "B00GTZWUPS", "B0047BXR9E", "B000O77SN6", "B003R4ZMQI", "B0079IEPHK", "B00005JNOG", "B000FIMG68", "B00L9FKMC6", "B0006UEVTK", "B00HUPC5X8", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B0047BXR30", "B000092T3Y", "B003UD7JEE", "B00BD6KXKW", "B00079FUI6", "B0051GOB2G", "B000TGURZ8", "B0018CWEYY", "B000P6YNSE", "B00HUCF7AO", "B00H57HOSC", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B000FFJYBQ", "B00E8OMZGG", "B001L5SRJE", "B000NDEXK2", "B0036EH3XE", "B006YG9HJE", "B0077PTWY6", "B001VPJZ0E", "B00133QNS6", "B003R0MEZO", "B003R0MEXQ", "B0019LY5IM", "B00B4804LM", "B000ICLRKC", "B000TM1CL0", "B0024FAR66", "B0077PTWHI", "B002KQ6UE2", "B00A8KJN8M", "B005FISC3Y", "B009LDD4V4", "B00915G6TE", "B000NOKFGW", "B004TJ1GY2", "B002NS2HBM", "B000QDLSR0", "B0009X76ZA", "B0018CWEZI", "B0060MYLCU", "B000FL7CAK", "B00062IDEW", "B002JVWRD6", "B003YF9Q08", "B001B7CNZ6", "B0001907BC", "B00B58948U", "B0013DZNAA", "B00B5ARKC0", "B00IWTVDUW", "B00170LCWC", "B002ZCY7SW", "B004YM6JVO", "B00JF5GAZA", "B009LDD1H6", "B000BZISRQ", "B001FACH7S", "B000NA2BEU", "B000FIMG4U", "B004SJN8XA", "B000ERVJLS", "B001AQMBJQ", "B0058YPJ8G", "B00BGQ2NIO", "B000MR8W92", "B00133QNRW", "B000SMNL92", "B001992NWO", "B004XM38CS", "B000MX7V66", "B0007P0Y7C", "B0012IXBNC", "B0053O8A46", "B00KS9V6EC", "B0006IUE16", "B003L77GZQ", "B000CNE0RO", "B00008YGRU", "B00CD45JBG"], "bought_together": ["B001MVWRNE", "B001MVWRMK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001MVWRNE", "B001MVWRN4", "B001MVWRMU", "B001MVWRMK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 56784}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 21.25, "brand": "Disney", "asin": "B0000ALF8I", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51aeA43SPJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Alias - The Complete Second Season"}

{"description": "Divorce number 2 is immediately on the cards as the fifth season opens with \"The One After Ross Says Rachel.\" As of this point, Ross's character undergoes some extreme personality changes (which apparently lost David Schwimmer many female fans). His incessant whining drives all the Friends to distraction, especially in \"The One Where Ross Moves In\" with Chandler (Matthew Perry) and Joey (Matt LeBlanc). Later things get uncomfortable both at work and at home when he goes through a period of rage (\"The One with Ross's Sandwich\"). While all this downplays his failed relationship with Rachel (Jennifer Aniston), the real idea is to allow focus on the secret pairing of Chandler and Monica (Courteney Cox) after a night of passion in London. This made for a return to the show's appealingly silly atmosphere as poor Joey is caught in the middle of everyone's secrets. Building to \"The One Where Everybody Finds Out,\" the silliness pauses for some genuinely touching interplay between Perry and Cox. The previous year's semi-serious thread about Phoebe's (Lisa Kudrow) birth gets forgotten fast: to distract the viewer she's introduced to Gary (Michael Rapaport) in \"The One with the Cop.\" This leads to some hilarious parodying with Phoebe interrogated about apartment hunting, and the guys excited and then scared in \"The One with the Ride-Along.\" She's more than over him by the time of the two-part finale, \"The One in Vegas,\" though, especially since she missed out on London.

{"description": "Falling neatly into theEnchanted AprilandUnder the Tuscan Suncategory, the made-for-HBOMy House in Umbriaboasts lovely Italian vistas and comforting Englishness. But it begins with a note of violence:  on a train rolling through the sunny countryside, a terrorist bomb detonates, killing a handful of passengers. The strangers that survive recuperate at the villa of an eccentric but kindly romance novelist, also a survivor of the blast. She's played by Maggie Smith, who bustles through the role with a pleasing mix of gin and daffodils. Chris Cooper is an uptight American who comes to the villa to pick up his orphaned niece and bristles at the bohemian atmosphere. Director Richard Loncraine maintains the melancholy mood amidst the sun-dappled gardens of Umbria, but Smith really holds the film together with her authority and slightly tipsy humor.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["630560097X", "B004SIP7D0", "B000BITVAG", "B005CFBZX4", "B002TZS58I", "B00AZMFO6I", "B000085OY1", "B005S9EJ14", "B000LPS34E", "B0002DRDY6", "B005SYZYYK", "B007A2O3FO", "B000E8JNQU", "B004XYOQU4", "B00003CX8N", "B00CDV4NAM", "B00005JKNF", "B000F3UAFC", "B000ETRCN0", "B00009IB1D", "B0001I55M4", "B0080QOL10", "B0000VD02Y", "B000C8STWQ", "B0001US78G", "B00G35R9ZK", "B00BVMXCRY", "B004ALIG2O", "B000LXHK2C", "6305692696", "B003U4H0CE", "B0080QOKYS", "B0001US7Q8", "B00003CXC9", "B004JMSIQS", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B0073U2EWM", "B0013K2ZGI", "B000A8AXXG", "B0018M6J90", "B009T6CXG0", "B0080QOL1A", "B0007P0XAU", "B005CFC0HE", "B00598OA2C", "B0018O50VG", "B00005Y6XU", "B000N4SHOE", "B00005JOA0", "B00AZMFO9U", "B00GOC756A", "B0001DCYUU", "B00IK481FO", "B00003CXXY", "B004KDYQXU", "B001NI6BJC", "B000ERVJQ8", "B004SIP6BI", "B00G15MDI0", "B002I5GNZQ", "B00000F3FS", "B001KP2J3U", "B00062IZ0Y", "B00L16P1I8", "B0000C23T0", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B008KEQLZ6", "B004LVRQ5G", "0142003654", "B007E88PU8", "B003CP1T50", "B009ERK1ZO", "B002ZG988M", "B005JZBOV0", "B0013NAMLK", "B00DC5K1FO", "B007JNR54A", "B00F1BFRA6", "B00GPWEPZ8", "B000I0RNV6", "B003B3V0W0", "B000FQISV2", "6305428557", "B00003CXMY", "0788815490", "B004R4PWYY", "B004JMSIVI", "B0007P0XAA", "B005T0OY5S", "B001UV4XGU", "B005HI4LMI", "B00441GYRO", "B008UQUS26", "B00005OBAL", "B0001US61O", "B00A429YF6", "B000NY1EAS", "B009L2EW5W", "B00008G7UF", "B0002B15Y2"], "bought_together": ["630560097X", "B000BITVAG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["630560097X", "B005S9EJ14", "B00AZMFO6I", "B000BITVAG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 4939}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.01, "brand": "SMITH,MAGGIE", "asin": "B0000CE684", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QMQOqUsAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "My House in Umbria"}

{"description": "TheUnderworldDVD has a powerful soundtrack that makes good use of ambient noises (e.g., bullet casings pinging on the floor) and has a clear, well-defined picture, which is especially impressive considering the film's predominant look is black leather at nighttime.  The first segment of the four-part, 54-minute documentary is mostly self-congratulation and plot summary (which is not necessarily a bad thing); more interesting are the creature effects and the actors learning how to do their own stunts.  If you were wondering if the voice of the Lycan Raze was really that deep, you can listen to him--actor/co-writer Kevin Grevioux--along with director Len Wiseman and co-writer Danny McBride on the first commentary track as they discuss breaking the rulebook for vampires and shooting in Budapest on a tiny $22 million budget.  The accent-heavy technical commentary discusses how the visual effects and sound design add to the film--one of their goals was to make Kate Beckinsale look \"sexy, stylish, and subversive.\"--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000F6IOC0", "B001HN697M", "B003Y5H5EW", "B0002KVUKM", "B0002J4X1Q", "0767834739", "B001JV5B12", "B000YPUF9W", "B002ZG98UA", "B009MO57H6", "0780624890", "B001AK3S4Y", "B001GUYB08", "B0007V6ITE", "B001F7MSFM", "B000F6IOBG", "B001GCUO0W", "B000FGGE68", "B005LAIHSG", "B0002YLCG0", "B0009MDPYM", "B000AYELVA", "0800195175", "B000069I1I", "B00005JKWJ", "B008OR5X4O", "B0000AXE8I", "B002GSXKNI", "B00005JKYX", "B004EPZ07K", "B005LAIH2C", "B003Y5H5F6", "B0000DKDUR", "B003HKN52U", "B002KX9CPO", "B005CFBZWK", "B00008AOVL", "B00IKM5LXG", "B001VLFE7Q", "B004LWZW42", "B001VLFE7G", "B0001BKAEY", "B005LAIH54", "B001QOGYFO", "B00005JL78", "B0000844I8", "B001PR0Y8K", "B005G4TJUC", "B002NXSRVG", "B00005JM5E", "B00AEBBA72", "B001L9EXUC", "B0007WFX62", "B0013J55B6", "B002O3Z50Q", "B00000JQB5", "B002ZG977Y", "B00003CXTA", "B000GCFO0I", "B0000959N0", "B00AEFXCLU", "B0001O3YD0", "B001OQCV6A", "B0002ZDVEU", "B002ZG98N2", "B005LAIIPS", "B000IHY9TS", "B00005JM5B", "B004LWZWGA", "B000P0J0AQ", "B0053FANPY", "B00AEFY5B6", "B0085A9HU6", "B000CEV4XQ", "B00005RHGK", "B0000E2R6P", "B0006SSOHC", "B000OVLBHG", "B00AEFYGBA", "B002TMI2A2", "B0002VEUV2", "B009YQJ322", "B000EHRVP6", "B003ZKBELG", "B00005JNJV", "B002DKGWSE", "B000VWYJ86", "B005LAIHYU", "B00003CXSD", "B0015XHP2C", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00AZTUUQK", "B004EPYZT4", "B000TGJ80S", "B00027JZ3E", "B001GKJ2E8", "B001VLBDD0", "0767803434", "B004LWZWFQ", "B00195FUDC"], "bought_together": ["B003Y5H5EW", "B001HN697M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003Y5H5EW", "B007WZTG1U", "B001VLFE7G", "B001HN697M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 128315}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.94, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0000VAFNQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412NSB5PCYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Underworld (Full Screen Special Edition)"}
{"description": "Partly inspired by 1948'sThe Big Clockand its nominal 1987 remakeNo Way Out, the Denzel Washington thrillerOut of Timeis quite enjoyable if you ignore its implausible plotting. Like those earlier films, this reunion of Washington and hisDevil in a Blue Dressdirector Carl Franklin is about a man--in this case the police chief (Washington) of sleepy Banyan Key, Florida--who falls into a trap set by others, sinks into legal quicksand of his own making, and must race the clock to extricate himself from a series of incriminating setbacks. The Florida setting adds welcome character to the potboiler plot, and Washington's screen-cred makes it easy to overlook the absurdities of rookie writer David Collard's screenplay. Eva Mendes is sharp and sensible as Washington's estranged wife (do you think they'll reconcile for a happy ending?), and the talented John Billingsley--whose portrayal of \"Dr. Phlox\" on TV'sEnterpriseis vastly underrated--is a constant delight as Washington's medical examiner, beer buddy and wily co-conspirator.

{"description": "The Frontis both a comic delight and perhaps the most graceful act of show business revenge in cinema history. Written by, directed by, and starring various talents blacklisted during the McCarthy-era witch hunts of the 1950s entertainment industry, the film stars Woody Allen as Howard, a cashier and bookie approached by blacklisted television-writer Alfred (Michael Murphy) to act as a \"front,\" i.e., the alleged author of Alfred's works. The scam proves hugely successful. Soon Howard is fronting for several other banned writers, taking a cut from every sale to the networks, and basking in praise (and romantic attentions) for his prolific talent. It all unravels when congressional investigators dig into Howard's past for Communist ties and squeeze him to name others with supposed links to the Red Menace.The Frontis charming, tragic, heroic, and briskly intelligent, featuring a heartbreaking performance by Zero Mostel and directed by Martin Ritt (Hud).--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008L3SA", "B00AEFYVUQ", "0767819764", "B00020X88E", "B00008978N", "B000AM6P2U", "B0013D8LC2", "0792846125", "B00005O06N", "B00005AUJO", "B00004STRD", "B000IU37SO", "B00005AUJK", "B00005JL81", "B002LMV7RA", "B0064NTZKI", "B00005AUJH", "B00005O06I", "B00003CXGS", "B00005AUJI", "B00005AUJM", "0792846095", "B00003CY6A", "B00005O06K", "0792846060", "B00005O06L", "B001DJ7PR8", "0792846087", "B00005O06M", "B001539HQY", "0792846117", "6305162034", "B00009Q4W7", "B00005O06J", "B0007XBKP4", "B007NYZA0Q", "6304907729", "B00G7QPXUI", "B005MYEQ4U", "B00005O06O", "B00005JL0I", "B00KQTHKQC", "B000063UQP", "B008FYZHHE", "B00GJNQ470", "B00127RAHG", "B00HRISNPM", "B00005AUJE", "B002EP8FEM", "0792846052", "B00012L786", "B00005AUKD", "B006TTC5A4", "B00ICWO1LC", "B000BP86PA", "B000E5RK6I", "B00H96KG2U", "B000BMY2LU", "B004H9X4CG", "B004ULEEQG", "B00006RCNV", "B007Y1NNAW", "B000244EWY", "B002GSXKQA", "B002LMV7QG", "B000059HAN", "B0080JG2L4", "B00I4X8KU2", "B00J2PQZEY", "B00004W229", "B00GG0NABE", "B000RXVND8", "B00GPPXNLC", "B00005A0QS", "B000MQ54M6"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFYVUQ", "0767819764"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFYVUQ", "B00005O06N", "B00008L3SA", "B00005AUJK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 34348}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.27, "brand": "SONY (COLUMBIA)", "asin": "B00013D580", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51wJQITzS1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Front"}

{"description": "Kind of a dementedMonsters, Inc.meetsOliver Twist, the 1989 live-action filmLittle Monsterstakes every child's nightmare of a monster under the bed and spins it into a dark tale of a secret underworld where children and adults turn into monsters and run wild without rules or any sense of social niceties. Maurice (Howie Mandel), the monster under Brian's (Fred Savage) bed, is not an average monster, but a hyper-talking, mischievous, blue-faced boy who disappears from inside his clothes when exposed to bright light and who says he wants nothing more than to be Brian's friend. As the new kid in town with parents who are constantly fighting, Brian is in desperate need of a friend and is easily lured into the underworld of the Little Monsters. There he learns to spy on his classmates as they sleep and raise havoc around their homes and lives. At first, his escapades make him insanely happy, but soon his exploits take a toll on his performance in school, his interaction with family, and his friendships with other kids. Brian eventually discovers that all is not quite as simple and free in the monster's world as it appears and that perhaps total freedom from societal rules isn't quite as good as it sounds. The pace of pranking is frantic in this film, the images can be disturbing, and some of the jokes, antics, and language are downright crude, so it's definitely not appropriate for children who are easily scared or those under age 10.--Tami Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001I562I", "B00094ARVO", "B00079Z9Y6", "B002GOAH10", "B00AGKHBQK", "B000FVQLM0", "B002XUBDRY", "0783232047", "B001MWUWU8", "B0064SVO9I", "B00DW5IL92", "B000260NTK", "B000MRNWKG", "B00AEFXPG2", "B002GHHHOM", "6305428050", "B00094ARJ6", "B0002JP5EK", "B002NZK5SW", "B001AGXEAG", "B00008979O", "B000P0J09W", "B000065V42", "B000BPL2GK", "B0000UJDLM", "B000059H76", "B0000DZ3EN", "B000P0J0A6", "6305433925", "B002I41KNC", "B00000K3D4", "B0000897DW", "B0002V7O3I", "B0024FADAQ", "B005QX8UEE", "B0012RWQJ8", "B0003JAONG", "B00002SSKI", "B00028HBES", "B000068MC1", "B0006J28MI", "6305162018", "B0000WN0UU", "B002NZK5TG", "6305428549", "B00008979N", "B001SXZ7T2", "B004GJYRF0", "B000XKW2WG", "B0000C3I99", "B00000JPH6", "B001Q8MMCE", "B00AEFXI2I", "B00008L3T3", "B000PMFS0A", "B008Y1YKOE", "B00AGKHEQM", "B00005JG6M", "B000BYA4JM", "B0002TSZI8", "B000U1ZV5I", "B000089771", "B001BPVB5G", "B00013WWT8", "B000067FP8", "6305428042", "B000056T4I", "B004QSQMKE", "B00000IQC4", "B00AMDA2O4", "B0007TKNEW", "B004RA7YU8", "B0087F7VSY", "B00006FDCD", "B0006GANV4", "B00003CXIS", "B0000DZTNB", "B002S6L2VU", "B005OK0YVG", "B0001IN0S0", "B0080BFWAE", "B000056H26", "B000089778", "B00BTYSIWI", "B00005JD5H", "B0043X1FOK", "B0001GOH84", "B008R65XSI", "B000A0GXF6", "B00AEBB9DW", "B0015RRNN4", "B003PIUINI", "B001AEF6C2", "B00E1HIX66", "B003156II4", "B000065V43", "B001ECDVKE", "B0053TWVA0"], "bought_together": ["B0001I562I", "0783232047"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000P0J09W", "B002XUBDRY", "B0001I562I", "B00AGKHBQK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3245}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.64, "brand": "MGM", "asin": "B0001AW14C", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KAZ15JXCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Little Monsters"}
{"description": "This two-disc set certainly improves upon the fluffyReloadedDVD release. Although there's still no Wachowski brothers talking about their creation, there's a lot of good stuff here in the three main segments. We are constantly reminded how long the back-to-back filming schedule was, and it's most interesting to hear from the actors and artists as they come to the end of this long road. When a white rabbit flashes on screen, you can \"branch\" the most interesting documentary footage: how \"bullet time\" is being recalibrated and how you go about replicating so many Agent Smiths. A timeline is wonderfully put together, but cumbersome to navigate through. The extras certainly illustrate how the movie did not deserve to be passed over for a few technical Oscar nominations.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000AXE8I", "B000P0J0AQ", "B00008LDPU", "B001TK80C0", "B00005N5S5", "B001VLBDD0", "B000AYELVA", "B004LWZW42", "B004LWZWGA", "B001FB55HQ", "B001HN697M", "B000EGDB10", "B0002J4X1Q", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00005JN0T", "B00005JNJV", "B003Y5H5EW", "B001GKJ2E8", "B005LAIHXQ", "B000UR9T8C", "B000VWYJ86", "B009MO57H6", "B00005JMEW", "B00005JMUA", "B00003CWT6", "B001DHXT20", "B00005JKZV", "B00005JKCH", "B000HCO83Q", "B000U7WV1Y", "B000099635", "B0000VAFO0", "B000HRMAPE", "B001DJLD1M", "B008JFUS0U", "B000VR0570", "B005LAIGW8", "B001GZ6QC4", "B005G4TJUC", "B000QXDED6", "B000P0J06K", "B0087ZG7NO", "B00005JLXH", "B004LWZWFQ", "B00003CXTA", "B00IKM5LXG", "B00005JKWJ", "B002ZG98UA", "B0002KVUKM", "B00004STUL", "0780624890", "B00011CZRE", "B004SIP95G", "B00005JKZY", "B00005JA8B", "B00E5I2M6I", "B0090SI56Y", "B0009MDPYM", "B008JFUPFI", "B00005JNTU", "B002IPFWTE", "B000P0J06U", "B001F7MSFM", "B000AYELVU", "B007K3JFUQ", "B00005JMQW", "B0049IHX2C", "B0007P0XBO", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B0085A9HU6", "B00AEFY5B6", "B008JFUO72", "B00006HBUJ", "B001AK3S4Y", "B000P0J0EW", "B0007V6ITE", "0767834739", "B00005JLWN", "B0000VCZK2", "B00FEHCQEC", "B0014Z4ON4", "B001UV4XHY", "B002GSXKNI", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00070FX5U", "B00177YA1K", "B00005JKIP", "B003QO8TOQ", "B000U1ZV8K", "B002ZG980U", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0045HCJGC", "B00000JQB5", "B00005JL78", "B004EPYZUS", "B002ZG99QS", "B000AP04FG", "B000HEVZ9E", "B000OVLBF8"], "bought_together": ["B0000AXE8I", "B000P0J0AQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001DJLD1M", "B000P0J0AQ", "B0000AXE8I", "B001BRJZPW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 123737}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "Matrix", "asin": "B0001BKAEE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5149DT5Y2CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Matrix Revolutions (Two-Disc Full Screen Edition) [DVD]"}

One morning, they wake up to find that everybody in Los Angeles has been turned to dust by a Comet except them, a guy who looks like Erik Estrada, some zombies and the occupants of a secret underground government installation. Written by Mark Logan Two girls from the Valley wake up to find that a passing comet has eradicated their world and left behind a mysterious red-dust and a pack of cannibal mutants. With the help of a friendly truck driver, the girls save the earth from a villainous \"think tank,\" karate chop their way through flesh-eating zombies, and, of course, find time to go to the mall. Written by Jaime Kidwell\n\nTwo sisters, high school seniors in the early 1980s, awaken one morning to blood red skies and the realization that the human race has been wiped out. It becomes apparent that anyone who was not surrounded by steel when the Earth recently passed through the tail of Haley's comet has been reduced to a pile of red ash (the trace elements of human chemical makeup.) They encounter a rebellious Native American man and take over the air waves at a local radio station in an attempt to get help. Unfortunately, they attract the attention of a group of scientists who knew what the effects of the comet would be. They hid underground in a steel laboratory, but idiotically left the vents open. Now, as various survivors of the comet who were only partially surrounded by steel are decaying into flesh-hungry zombies, the scientists are attempting to come up with a vaccine made of the blood of people who were not infected by the comet. Thus the trio must fight their way past not only roving packs of the cannibalistic dead, but also outsmart a pack of scientists desperate not to become that way themselves.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003JIPN20", "B003PIUINI", "6300182355", "0792845684"], "also_viewed": ["B002KPUN0K"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 232523}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.95, "brand": "", "asin": "B0001GV4PI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41101R6Z2KL.jpg", "title": "Night of the Comet"}

{"description": "No actor works harder to open a movie than Tom Cruise. His enthusiasm is throughout the DVD extras as he mirrors his samurai character by constantly talking about \"loyalty\" and \"discipline\" while working on the film. However as a post-movie experience, the top-line extras with Cruise and director Edward Zwick are repetitive and underwhelming, with too many clips from the film we assume DVD viewers have just seen. The History Channel show is also a pre-release promotional device that misses an opportunity to really dig into this intriguing time period. Better are segments on the costumes, the production design, and how you put together an Imperial army--in New Zealand, no less. Zwick's low-key and dense commentary (plus a \"Video Journal\") is not vital, but he illustrates many of the little peculiarities it took to make the wide-ranging film come together. There are two deleted scenes; a samurai's first appearance is particularly memorable.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFY5B6", "B002O3Z50Q", "B00004XPPG", "B00AMSLDTM", "B0002YLCG0", "B0000DZTIW", "B000AARKOO", "B000QXDED6", "B003U0AHBO", "B00AEFXKUI", "B000A2WP7O", "B008MIMWOY", "B00AEBBA36", "B004AOECXI", "6305692688", "B000MGB6NM", "B0000TANUI", "079283366X", "B00005JL78", "B000W1SZBS", "B004SIP88Y", "B0034G4P58", "B001TUZG4K", "B00AS1Q93S", "B000MRA592", "B00001ZWUS", "B000E5N6LG", "B000XR9L50", "B0001HLVS2", "B00HEPDGKA", "B003ASLJO0", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000P0J0EW", "B0000A2ZNX", "B00005JNTI", "B0018QPPXW", "B000065U1N", "B000095WW8", "B0002WZTOI", "B002VWNIEA", "B004U7MQWY", "B002VWNID6", "B008JFUO36", "B00AEBB86A", "B00005JN0W", "B0007Q6VXC", "B001LRJH0U", "B000MZHW40", "B0002IQMAM", "B00004WG2F", "B003INBO3I", "B000EHRVMY", "B000NOKFHQ", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEFXVCU", "B000YENUI6", "B000M341QE", "B0000YEEGM", "B001680M26", "B008R65XYC", "B002ZG99QS", "B00008K76U", "B000HRMAPE", "B007TBKAXK", "B00000G3PA", "0767810856", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00AEFXYJA", "B002T9H2LA", "B000P0J0AG", "B00003CXZ1", "B000O599YO", "B000FS9FCG", "6304711905", "B00AEFXRRO", "B000HRMAUY", "B001ILHY1I", "B002NZK5V4", "B002VWNICC", "B000VKL6ZM", "B001UDS4BS", "B002ZG997C", "B004SIP8ZM", "0800177967", "B0001O3YD0", "B00005ATZT", "B004XFZ3UU", "B00004Z4WR", "B005LAIH2W", "B0007TKNGA", "B00000JQB5", "B0012Q732O", "B002ZG97RE", "B0002VEUV2", "0800141741", "B002ZG977Y", "B00005N5S3", "B00008G8M4", "B0000B1OFL"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFY5B6", "B00004XPPG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000QXDED6", "B00BEJL6JK", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00JU949TK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 121880}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 17.25, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001JXOUS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EdSWs9r9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Last Samurai (Full Screen Edition)"}

{"description": "The DVD extras forBarbershop 2are much like the movie itself--not  especially inspired or surprising, but raffish and likable. None of the  handful of deleted scenes seem unjustly left out, but a couple  (particularly the ones featuring Cedric the Entertainer) prove  entertaining. Of the two audio commentaries, the one by the director and  producers falls flat, full of a lot of self-congratulation; the less  self-conscious talk from the actors proves more amusing (with Cedric again  providing most of the wit). A couple of music videos (one with Mary J.  Blige and Eve, another with Sleepy Brown and Outkast) are enjoyable, but  the usual outtakes (actors laughing at their flubs) and still photos are  bland and perfunctory.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006RVJR", "B0009X7BFK", "B0002B14UW", "B000098XQ8", "B0014QLEI6", "B00066FAQW", "B001DJLD12", "B000VG66XS", "B000HDZKLO", "B00AEFYHVO", "B0034G4P1C", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B000093I8L", "B00003CY51", "6305505780", "B00005LB86", "B000FS9ULC", "B000069DOB", "0780631234", "B002CA68N4", "B000056BOW", "B00004STUL", "B00177YFYM", "1558908390", "B000YAF4Q6", "B003Y5H56K", "B005LAIH86", "B000RBA6C4", "B00AEFY6TW", "B00005JLQT", "B00004Y2R1", "B00AEFYAC0", "B002VKB0LU", "B002GSXKO2", "B0002J4YVK", "B00124ONGA", "B00HX0KIAM", "B001DJLCQS", "B002VWNICM", "B00004WLTP", "6304821832", "B000PE0GRI", "B00003W8NT", "B000BOH8X2", "B004FPE43K", "B001132GNY", "B003UEYBPI", "B00465I1CE", "B004BZ5AFA", "B0000YEE6M", "0783240201", "B0041QSZS8", "B00AEFYE08", "B001KKU9DM", "B0018RNF60", "B0006GAI5U", "B00005JPK8", "0780627822", "B0013ERFGE", "B0009W5JR8", "B00GOZ2LPM", "B008SOS7W8", "0783237367", "B002CA68MU", "B00066FAVW", "B00008977B", "B002NZK5QO", "B00005RIX5", "B004H83INW", "B002GSXKOM", "B000803BQC", "B00005JND5", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00005JLG1", "B000BITV9W", "B000F9SO0O", "B00005JLON", "B002ZG99RW", "B00066FAC6", "B00005JN4H", "B001P3SA94", "B000XT1P52", "B005LAIH1S", "0767811070", "B002CA68NO", "B00275EHHS", "B000BTITFI", "B0026JI1R2", "0767813901", "B00003GPFT", "B004WJT5E2", "B00E1LQEFE", "B0001MMGC2", "B000XSWVEC", "B000071ZZJ", "B00003CY5Y", "B00000JGHV", "B00005IBN0", "B008B9JTLI", "B0014BQR7Y"], "bought_together": ["B00006RVJR", "B0009X7BFK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00006RVJR", "B0009X7BFK", "B003UEYBPI", "B000098XQ8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 33314}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.19, "brand": "MGM", "asin": "B0001Q4BOE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514P1HEJ83L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Barbershop 2: Back in Business (Special Edition)"}

{"description": "Allowing for all the low-budget shortcomings that plague any straight-to-video production,Starship Troopers 2: Hero of the Federationserves up 92 minutes of passable sci-fi action. Parlaying his veteran status as an animator, special-effects wizard, and stalwart survivor of the CGI revolution, Phil Tippett (with returning screenwriter Ed Neumeier) makes a woefully uninspired directorial debut with this makeshift sequel to Paul Verhoeven's 1997blockbuster, retaining the jarhead militarism of Robert Heinlein's original novel while serving up more bugs, an all-new cast of attractive young stars, and all-too-familiar plot elements borrowed from a dozen better movies. \"Bigger is better\" is out of the question under such meager budgetary circumstances, so Tippett and Neumeier compensate with gruesome bugfights and gross-out effects at regular intervals, some standard-issue nudity, and escalating paranoia (echoing Carpenter'sThe Thing) when a new breed of bugs use human hosts (&agrave; laThe Hidden) to overtake a stranded platoon of Federation soldiers on a bug-infested planet. Relying on murky confinement to hide nondescript sets,Troopers 2has three engaging leads in its favor: TV regular Richard Burgi is solidly cast as the titular hero (he's the military equivalent ofPitch Black's Riddick); Colleen Porch is engaging as the most sensible Federation survivor; and screen veteran Ed Lauter makes the most of his salty role as a battle-hardened general. Unfortunately, they're adrift in a knock-off sequel (shot on high-def digital video) that could never do justice to its energetic predecessor.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0018CWWA0", "B000OVLBHG", "B0088X7YMS", "B0018CWW9Q", "B0088X7YU0", "B000UAFDP2", "B00D3LA7G0", "B005TK0MFE", "B0009I8QI6", "B001AV3BYK", "B0001XAOKC", "B009MO57H6", "B001I9XOQO", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00IKM5LXG", "B00AG51V8E", "B00D2ZF24O", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B00005OSJQ", "B00000ILDF", "B005LAIHPE", "1558908846", "B001HN697M", "B002ZG98UA", "B00AEFXCLU", "B002NXSRVG", "B00GBHNP7G", "B00005N5S5", "B00003CY6P", "B008OR5X4O", "B00BUAEYVK", "B005GYXO30", "B00JA3RVG4", "B008E70EES", "B00000IREA", "B005CHV14A", "B0006SGYL0", "B008JFUNHI", "B005LAIHXQ", "B001KMB6X2", "B000CNER1S", "B00005V1WW", "6304936532", "B0034G4ORC", "B0000AFX64", "B005LAII44", "B0029WLJHK", "B000QUCRB4", "B008JFUPFI", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B009YQJ322", "B001451HX4", "B00000ILDG", "B00003CXZ1", "B0090SI56Y", "B001CC7PLM", "0792839722", "B00AEFYGBA", "B005LAII3A", "B002U6CJCO", "B0045HCJ9O", "B005OK721G", "B005LAIIMG", "B009HIKAN8", "B00195FUDW", "B0016I0AKU", "B0087OULG4", "B00HEPDGKA", "B0047S4USO", "B004EPZ08O", "B00E8AVNAE", "B00A2H9OSK", "B009WGYXIS", "B00005R1O8", "B00003CY5D", "B007C4ZJ0S", "B001MTYRKC", "B00CFA222M", "B008JFUO36", "B00070FX5U", "B000FGGE68", "B005LAIGW8", "B000KX0HIW", "B00A34LX9A", "B0000AOX0F", "B008JFUN50", "B0001VTPWC", "B000SM6FLI", "B0073U2FB2", "B00AZMFJYA", "B000056HP6", "B00BEIYHT2", "B008JFURII", "B003Y5H5EW", "B004EPYZSK", "B00022XE6S", "B0002S94CK", "B007ZC31R0", "0767834739", "1451689012"], "bought_together": ["B0018CWWA0", "B000OVLBHG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000OVLBHG", "B0018CWW9G", "B0018CWWA0", "B0088X7YMS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 133578}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.13, "brand": "Columbia/Tristar Studios", "asin": "B0001XAOQ6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RKH5Q1C7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Starship Troopers 2 - Hero of the Federation"}
{"description": "\"In your satin tights / Fighting for your rights / And the old Red, White, and Blue!... / Wonder Woman!\" Could anyone who grew up in the '70s ever forget that super-catchy theme song? Originally packaged as the female version of theBatmanTV show (producer Stanley Ralph Ross penned 32 of the caped crusader's episodes),Wonder Womanended up redefining the campy, comic book genre. The primetime show immediately became a social and cultural phenomenon, attracting a wide audience that continued to tune in to America's favorite socially progressive superheroine.Looking back on it now, it is easy to see the attraction of this unique show that oozed '70s culture, but was set in the 1940s. While trying to stop a Nazi plane from reaching the U.S., Major Steve Trevor (Lyle Waggoner) is shot down, landing on mythical Paradise Island.  The uncharted island is the hidden home to the lost tribe of eternally young Amazon women. The Amazons take in the Major and nurse him back to health. During his recovery he attracts the sympathy and interest of Princess Diana (Lynda Carter, former Miss USA 1973) who is intrigued by the man from the mainland and his tales of the evil Nazis.  She decides she must follow the Major back to the U.S. and join the forces of good against the tyranny of evil.  So begins the saga of the beautiful Amazon Wonder Woman, armed with super strength, bulletproof bracelets, and the unbreakable, \"truth-telling,\" golden lasso. What sets season 1 apart from the two subsequent seasons is that the pilot and each of the 13 episodes take place during World War II, corresponding to the original comic stories.  In this season we see Wonder Woman battle spies, uncover Fausta the Nazi Wonder Woman, stop thieves trying to steal the secret substance of Amazonian power (Feminum), wrestle a Nazi-trained circus gorilla, and rescue an interplanetary visitor held captive by the Third Reich--all of which are priceless.Included with the pilot episode is an extremely fun commentary track by Lynda Carter and producer Douglas C. Kramer. Also added on the DVD set is the making-of featurette \"Beauty, Brawn and Bulletproof Bracelets.\"  Yes, it is very campy, cheesy, dated, and filled with double entendres and subtle innuendos.

{"description": "They called Wattstax the \"black Woodstock,\" but there are many differences between that seminal hippie event and the 1972 concert documented in this 30th-anniversary special-edition reissue. Woodstock was all about peace, love, and music. Wattstax, held three years later in Los Angeles, had those elements as well; but as this 103-minute film reminds us, it was a more socio-politically charged event, with its emphasis on black pride and the simple opportunity for African Americans to assert that, in opening speaker Jesse Jackson's words, \"I am somebody.\" There's also a good deal less music in this film than in theWoodstockmovie. As the title suggests, a host of great Stax Records artists (including Rufus and Carla Thomas, the Bar-Kays, the Staple Singers, Albert King, and show closer Isaac Hayes) performed, but much ofWattstaxdoesn't even take place inside the L.A. Coliseum, where the concert was held, but rather in the churches and shops and on the streets of Watts itself (music fans would be better off checking out theWattstaxdouble CD).Wattstax, in fact, is much less a music movie than a chronicle of black life seven years after the Watts race riots, as well as what comedian Richard Pryor (who delivers several hilarious but scathing bits) calls \"a soulful expression of the black experience.\"--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000UD2K32", "B000SNUNY2", "B002WH0ZAE", "B000UB054U", "B001F9FHFI", "B000UCWK1U", "B005NHZAHS", "B00019PD2K", "B0014JKL6Y", "B0002KP4HW", "B0030ATZIA", "B000PSJDQ4", "B001AZI26I", "B002QVTBEM", "B001N5BDKW", "B0006HBL96", "B000BC8STC", "B001NJY69S", "B001675YUW", "B0001BKAP8", "B000000ZMT", "B00008J2HC", "B00D3LA7H4", "B003KWWDJG", "B0000TWMT8", "B0000696I2", "B00JQ0IU0C", "B000KP62UM", "B00008OM72", "B00A3Z1C9A", "B00003OSU4", "B000GW8RYI", "B00005MAG5", "B005D0TERW", "B000087F5D", "B00E1LR2B4", "B004T1RAWW", "B00013F2OA", "6305310963", "B0002T2QII", "B000FL7CBE", "B000803BPS", "B00005NFZV", "B00004Z4VH", "B000FG65SA", "B000KG4BD6", "B0000AVHDC", "B0009EST8C", "B000FMH8RG", "B001N5BDLQ", "B00007ELEK", "B00D7DTSQ4", "B000053VAA", "B0025Z4Q4O", "B00H3JHH6Q", "B001NXDSLQ", "B00005NFYH", "B0006FYOX8", "B00AEFYG3S", "B002BO2RWW", "B00005UPFK", "B000BUE5FA", "1616200782", "B00D9EJFS2", "B002U4UZT0", "B000B8IANU", "B00261E0T8", "1596915773", "B0007GP6EM", "B0058KGHX6", "B00062IYXM", "B001FBSLH2", "B0084I9QIW", "B000092Q7B", "B002612S4W", "B00004Z3ZW", "B00E1LQEFE", "B00IPL286U", "B0006UEVMC", "B007KLEHUQ", "B000BI1YU6", "B000YGE18C", "B0009S4IGA", "1451647859", "B000RIWAQC", "B00003L9CG", "B001HZ4K8K", "B00ERH14HA", "B00HRHZ5BI", "B0028NSE3M", "B0052T1EBS", "B00008CMRM", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00CC7RE0I", "B000BOH91S", "B004SC8XHI", "B006JN86VW", "B002E2M5IW", "B0000AYL2M", "B002WBYDLC"], "bought_together": ["B000UD2K32"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000UD2K32", "B000UB054U", "B000SNUNY2", "B0030ATZIA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 21666}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 17.5, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000294U6E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FDAJK75WL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wattstax (30th Anniversary Special Edition)"}
{"description": "Where else but onSouth Parkwill you find irreverent comedy as scathingly hilarious as \"The Passion of the Jew\"? Premiering just one month afterThe Passion of the Christwas released in theaters, this typically outrageous episode tore into Mel Gibson's film with characteristic glee, ruthlessly condemning Gibson's courtship of controversy and depicting Gibson as a raving, greedy, egotistical lunatic (recalling the classicfirst seasonepisode \"Mecha-Streisand\") while promoting a fair-minded appreciation of Christ's teachings over the relentless violence of Gibson's film. Perfectly playing off established character conflicts, the episode pits Mel-worshipping Cartman (who embraces Gibson's alleged anti-Semitism to justify his own homespun Nazi revival) against Kyle, who is traumatized by Gibson's film into feeling guilty about his own Jewish heritage. Never ones to flinch from taboo topics or political correctness, series creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone outdid themselves with this amazingly rapid response to Gibson's film, and it's destined to rank as an all-timeSouth Parkclassic. Likewise, the bonus episodes \"Christian Rock Hard\" (from 2003) and \"Red Hot Catholic Love\" (from 2002) tackle the commercialism of Christian music (as deviously exploited by Cartman) and the news-making controversy of sexual misconduct among Catholic priests, which somehow manages to incorporate a scatological sub-plot about the marvels of \"interorectogestion,\" answering the age-old question of... well, you'll just have to watch to find out.

{"description": "Declared \"luminously beautiful\" by the New York Times, Andrey Zvyagintsev's The Return is a stunning mixture of visionary allegory, urgent suspense and road movie momentum. Zvyagintsev's equal skill with lush visuals, lucid storytelling and breathtaking realism easily netted The Return the prestigious Golden Lion and the Best First Feature Film Award at the Venice International Film Festival.  Within the emotional vacuum of a fatherless childhood, young brothers Andrei (Vladimir Garin) and Ivan (Ivan Dobronravov) have grown closer than most siblings. But when they least expect it, the father the boys have never known returns. Under the cool midnight sun of a coastal Russian summer, Andrei and Ivan eagerly hop into a car for a week long fishing trip with a complete stranger they desperately need to believe is their father. but as they travel deeper into the Russian wilderness, their journey devolves from vacation to boot camp to father-sons love triangle and ultimately to a test of wills that pushes to the brink of violence. As it dawns on the boys that the man who could be their father might be trying to abandon, exploit or kill them, The Return's Jungian landscape gives way to fervid Freudian rage, shocking loss and bittersweet redemption.  Harried as one of the most auspicious film debuts since Badlands or The 400 Blows, The Return is both a gorgeous contemporary thriller and an astute updating of vanguard Soviet filmmaking. Disturbing, tender, transcendent, The Return's skillful marriage of psychological complexity to mythic imagery effortlessly evokes the watershed films of Andrei Tarkovsky and Roman Polanski.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000K2UEDG", "B00280QNK6", "B00019G4TQ", "B000RTCSIQ", "B000LTTOOS", "B004XVMCLC", "B0000633SD", "B00008ZZ9M", "B00006LPEK", "B0022RVO18", "B008MZTKFG", "B003OXGW5M", "B0000DGKI7", "B00009MEKP", "B000LV6OHQ", "B003VWR1XI", "B00003CXF4", "B0000633SB", "B00006JO77", "B000NQRDZG", "B00005QFE6", "6305257450", "B002BWP4A6", "B000I8OOG0", "6305744114", "B0000BWVCR", "B002QP145C", "B001MPS7GG", "B001PCNZEU", "B000B58DIA", "B0087OULO6", "B003MTAZCO", "B00HVOFP6W", "B006ML50YC", "B006IW8E3Y", "B004VH65A2", "B00009NHAT", "B000WS6YAA", "B0000ALPJ2", "B001UE49BQ", "B000EANSXM", "B00GMV8B1G", "B001H30Q08", "B000OVLBGC", "B00H0EN948", "B0001LJCAW", "B00019G4RS", "B000TGCR38", "B00006LPEH", "B001QOZYRS", "B000I8OOHE", "B000OCY7JE", "B0000C2IQA", "B000K7VHQO", "B00HRJVHEK", "B000PKG6OO", "B00151QYE4", "B0036TGSJE", "B002U4F5W2", "B00GA9F2PI", "B007FEHA0C", "B00IGK6TH4", "B0016K3988", "B000V7HFL4", "B00023P4N8", "B00AXYZZ6C", "B0002DB52M", "6305131104", "B00006LPER", "B00031TYGW", "B000EHQU30", "B009XTF8NI", "B000FZEU0G", "B0000YEDM2", "B001CW7ZT4", "B009CSVQ8Q", "B006ML50S8", "B0048FQFFM", "B0019T0JAW", "B004SIP6GI", "B00GPPXNLC", "B004GNBBVO", "B00EO2I6S8", "5489003219", "B000A5044C", "B00A8QDI1Y", "B00005N8A9", "B00H91LWBY", "B0000714AW", "B00065GX0K", "6305899681", "B005LAIIIK", "B000BC8SWE", "B00000F3CD", "B002U1LGSW", "B0000DJYNI", "B000G0O5IM", "B00005JLQW", "B000BMY2NS", "B004G8QO7U"], "bought_together": ["B00280QNK6", "B000K2UEDG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000RTCSIQ", "B000K2UEDG", "B000LTTOOS", "B00280QNK6"]}, "price": 18.46, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 82114}, "asin": "B0002KQOH6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BBQQ48J2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Return"}
{"description": "With its campy combination of lightweight adventure and Spandex disco chic,Buck Rogers in the 25th Centuryis a nostalgic throwback to post-Star Warsopportunism. Series co-creator Glen A. Larson was incapable of originality, and former soap star Gil Gerard (in the title role) was a bland incarnation of the comic-strip hero, so the much-anticipated series premiered on September 20, 1979, with serious disadvantages. Although the two-hour pilot \"Awakening\" had tested successfully as a theatrical release, Gerard and the show's producers could never agree on a stable tone for the series, which presents Capt. William \"Buck\" Rogers as a jovial space cowboy who is accidentally time-warped from 1987 to 2491. Earth is engaged in interplanetary war following a global holocaust, and Buck's piloting skills make him an ideal starfighter recruit for the Earth Defense Directorate, where his closest colleagues are Dr. Huer (Tim O'Connor), squadron leader Col. Wilma Deering (former model Erin Gray, looking oh-so-foxy), the wisecracking robot Twiki (voiced by cartoon legend Mel Blanc), and a portable computer-brain named Dr. Theopolis, who's carried by Twiki like oversized bling-bling.The series struggled through an awkward first season, with routine plots elevated by decent special effects and noteworthy guest stars including Jamie Lee Curtis, ill-fatedPlayboyPlaymate Dorothy Stratten (appearing, with her voice dubbed over, less than a year before her tragic murder),Batmanalumnus Julie Newmar, Buster Crabbe (veteran of vintageBuck Rogersmovie serials), and several others in a show that favored vamps and vixens over credible science fiction. A full-scale overhaul resulted in a disastrous second season, but devoted fans still gravitate to Hawk (Thom Christopher), the charismatic alien \"birdman\" who was introduced with new characters and a new, space-faring search for lost tribes from Earth (with echoes of Larson's ownBattlestar Galactica). Behind-the-scenes squabbles continued, and by mid-season of 1981, NBC pulled the plug on a breezy, still-engaging series that suffered from uneasy chemistry and never realized its full potential. Existing somewhere betweenGalacticaandLost in Spacein the TV sci-fi food chain, thisBuck--with a dearth of DVD extras--now functions as a cheesy stroll down memory lane.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000W4KT9G", "B00GX7D5G0", "B003BGZ61S", "B000PFUAN2", "B006MFQ4OS", "B0000AFX64", "B001SGN1JM", "B00023BKMC", "B00005JOJP", "B00F3L8P26", "B000JLTRHW", "B00005B8UD", "B0009JE6FM", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B004EXWGJW", "B000067FP2", "B000HEWEJ4", "B005DGKBDC", "B004EXWGHY", "B00404ME2E", "B000BOH8Y6", "B003XMKU3Y", "B0009JE6G6", "B0001ZMWYG", "B0001I55SS", "B005GYXO8K", "B003H9LIU2", "B001DW2BG0", "B005UL4NH0", "B008H6GHII", "B0012IXBNC", "B000X07SQ6", "B0090F6SD4", "B002ZCY872", "B003CNQPNS", "B004VT9JLM", "B00E5G03I4", "B0006Z2KZ2", "B0007YMWGY", "B00466H3A4", "B00144P9RA", "B003W5C0TY", "B001RTCP1U", "B00264QI68", "B001CQONOA", "B0013LL2Z2", "B0002IQKAY", "B0006D3HE2", "B000PFUA9Q", "B00A04YHI2", "B003NH3X5Q", "B000BCCAEQ", "B000WLU5ZM", "B005LFQRTC", "B002KVSJ6O", "B000ELL1QC", "B006LPHY6G", "B002VA5A02", "B005G5NPD8", "B00CWX1HPA", "B0014BQR3I", "B005DKS1Z8", "B000SNUR34", "B001ECDVH2", "B000V5IP6K", "B005GYXN2M", "B001QE99BA", "B0000C23T1", "B008R65XN8", "B0049IHWYG", "B004M9ZI0C", "B00DYQ1GBE", "B000B8IA3U", "B000F7CMPE", "B002VA59ZS", "B000ION23U", "B001AQO43M", "B00080ZG2E", "B000N4RAQA", "B004VT9JMG", "B004UV3KS4", "B00005JNU5", "B003ES5JDI", "B0011FLGZQ", "B0038ZITIE", "B000TSTEMS", "B003XMKU0M", "B0001I55O2", "B000WTZ6SK", "B0036EH3UC", "B00BUDDMGU", "B001DHXT6G", "B0006UEVTA", "B00096S47G", "B00D9EJFZA", "B005EVY8NA", "B002OKK2AW", "B0014BQR38", "B000BR9SA0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005UL4NH0", "B0090F6SD4", "B00GX7D5G0", "B003BGZ61S"]}, "price": 12.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 31335}, "asin": "B0002MHDW4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FE0EDQARL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Buck Rogers in the 25th Century: The Complete Epic Series"}

Trouble is, Jon is clueless about how to cook a big bird; fortunately, starving Garfield has the good sense to call in Jon's spirited grandmother for a culinary rescue. Grandma shows up, too, in \"A Garfield Christmas,\" about a family get-together that covers all the nice holiday stuff and, of course, lots of bickering, pouting, and jealousy.

{"description": "A huge hit in France,Love Me if You Daretakes the traditional l'amour fou scenario and runs it through a pinball machine. From childhood, Julien and Sophie engage in an obsessive battle of one-upmanship:  if one of them hands a brightly colored candy tin to the other and makes a dare, the recipient is bound to honor it, no matter how destructive or dangerous the dare might be. When this wacky habit enters adulthood and begins wrecking their lives, they ought to change... but that's not how l'amour fou works. PartAmelie-style comedy, part dark fable, this movie has quirkiness to burn, if not always as much charm as it thinks it has. Leads Guillaume Canet and Marion Cotillard are ardent, although somewhat out-acted by their juvenile counterparts in the film's early section.

{"description": "The remarkable first season ofDeadwoodrepresents one of those periodic, wholesale reinventions of the Western that is as different from, say,Lonesome Doveas that miniseries is from Howard Hawks'sRio Bravoor the latter is from Anthony Mann'sThe Naked Spur. In many ways, HBO'sDeadwoodembraces the Western's unambiguous morality during the cinema's silent era through the 1930s while also blazing trails through a post-NYPD Blue, post-The West Wingtelevision age exalting dense and customized dialogue. On top of that,Deadwoodhas managed an original look and texture for a familiar genre: gritty, chaotic, and surging with both dark and hopeful energy. Yet the show's creator, erstwhileNYPD Bluehead writer David Milch, never ridicules or condescends to his more grasping, futile characters or overstates the virtues of his heroic ones.Set in an ungoverned stretch of South Dakota soon after the 1876 Custer massacre,Deadwoodconcerns a lawless, evolving town attracting fortune-seekers, drifters, tyrants, and burned-out adventurers searching for a card game and a place to die. Others, particularly women trapped in prostitution, sundry do-gooders, and hangers-on have nowhere else to go. Into this pool of aspiration and nightmare arrive former Montana lawman Seth Bullock (Timothy Olyphant) and his friend Sol Starr (John Hawkes), determined to open a lucrative hardware business. Over time, their paths cross with a weary but still formidable Wild Bill Hickok (Keith Carradine) and his doting companion, the coarse angel Calamity Jane (Robin Weigert); an aristocratic, drug-addicted widow (Molly Parker) trying to salvage a gold mining claim; and a despondent hooker (Paula Malcomson) who cares, briefly, for an orphaned girl. Casting a giant shadow over all is a blood-soaked king, Gem Saloon owner Al Swearengen (Ian McShane), possibly the best, most complex, and mesmerizing villain seen on TV in years.  Over 12 episodes, each of these characters, and many others, will forge alliances and feuds, cope with disasters (such as smallpox), and move--almost invisibly but inexorably--toward some semblance of order and common cause. Making it all worthwhile is Milch's masterful dialogue--often profane, sometimes courtly and civilized, never perfunctory--and the brilliant acting of the aforementioned performers plus Brad Dourif, Leon Rippy, Powers Boothe, and Kim Dickens.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EULSR0", "B000NVI2GU", "B0038M2APA", "B0075FF5QM", "B007A2Z3Y4", "B00B5J6A7W", "B004HW7JNS", "B00CG4XKNM", "B004BZ5AHI", "B00EAPC860", "B00HUCF420", "B00A2JOQMW", "B003Y5HWJU", "B008PJZDXW", "B0028RXXE8", "B00076YPUI", "B00HT850YW", "B00CDTSFF8", "B00J5LXT44", "B00BFAIH68", "B00G4RDQK4", "B002UJIY7A", "1596912391", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B00316DDUO", "B00C8CQRQ4", "B00ECGHM5O", "B000K2V7E6", "B0090XO59U", "B00EIXWW2O", "B005LAJ1H2", "B00HW3EXCE", "B00EEDNR9A", "B0012RLX88", "B00EUI4XHE", "B004QRUN96", "B00J5G1P2W", "B00003CXOP", "B00AATGDUC", "B00IARA8KM", "B009LDD54K", "B000PGTPH8", "B008CLI4N4", "B008V9HKF0", "B00ATP24V4", "6305504024", "B002N57KGM", "B005HAAZLC", "B00G0B7PTW", "B001TH8ZH8", "B000059H7K", "080328702X", "B001FA1OTU", "B0051GOB2G", "B00BVMXBDO", "B0060MYKYY", "B00911L7VA", "B00BQ42Q38", "B00GWJIDFW", "B001DJLCRC", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B0002ERXC2", "B000VWX6T4", "B008BLCP0S", "B00FEP9MYG", "B00GAHJO8G", "B00793J278", "B0002J4X2K", "B00005JL3K", "B00J4LMHMK", "B000YABIQ6", "6304711905", "B0058YPG1G", "B001FB4W0W", "B003PIUBZS", "B00DJYJRHG", "B004HW7JO2", "B001RTSPVY", "B00HEPE6MM", "B00CL151G4", "B00005NOHO", "B0024FAR5M", "B00AYNG9BC", "B0032UYFA6", "B009ERK2UI", "B000BO7DWI", "B000F1IQI2", "B00915G6WQ", "B0081QF6Q8", "B00B5J5YJM", "B00IWTVDUW", "B006MK4QKW", "B00ECHBSP8", "B009LDD1H6", "B0012CJQYQ", "B00BGI076M", "B001GCUER0", "B002FLOTPE", "B005FISBTO", "B0032JTV6A"], "bought_together": ["B000EULSR0", "B000NVI2GU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001FA1OTU", "B000EULSR0", "B0038M2APA", "B000NVI2GU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6874}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 34.99, "brand": "Warner Bros", "asin": "B0006FO5LO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61KQUt8dAdL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Deadwood: Season 1"}

{"description": "Originally broadcast asLegend of Earthseain December 2004, the Sci-Fi Channel's four-hour miniseries ofEarthsearides the coattails of theLord of the Ringstrilogy with its quest-driven story of humble blacksmith Ged (Shawn Ashmore), a wizard-to-be who is mentored by the magical Ogion (Danny Glover) as he seeks to preserve the realm of Earthsea from the evil King Tygath (Sebastian Roch&#xE9;). Ged's adventures lead him to the priestess Tenar (Kristen Kreuk, fromSmallville) and with secrets shared by High Priestess Thar (Isabella Rossellini), they gain the power to prevail over Tygath. As presented by Robert Halmi Sr. (producer ofMerlin,Gulliver's Travelsand several other fantasy miniseries), this skeletal rendering ofEarthseaboasts a wealth of digital effects and semi-lavish set design, but Ashmore's lack of charisma hampers a production already fraught with problems. It provoked the wrath of fantasy fans and a firm rejection by author Ursula K. Le Guin, who had watched helplessly (she wasn't involved or consulted) as her classic novelsA Wizard of EarthseaandThe Tombs of Atuanwere racially \"whitewashed\" (in Le Guin's words) nearly beyond recognition. As TV fantasy goes,Earthseais admirably ambitious, but best enjoyed by those with no awareness of the classic books it isveryloosely based on.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007OCG5Q", "B0039PGH9G", "B0000640T0", "B000AQOHMG", "B00B04NIZO", "B003RHZ6IE", "B0002Y4TWE", "B00260HH30", "B000MGUZCU", "B004CRR9EW", "B003Z8ZC1G", "B006JN87WK", "B0013D8L72", "B002XJDUV2", "B004WO9OUC", "B002436WFI", "B0010X744G", "B002C6VMJI", "B003BI7718", "B003C5FMNK", "B001RXDM1I", "B0010X741Y", "B0031DDG9A", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B00EQ2KVQQ", "B000E1YW2M", "B0040GMPEE", "B00AEFXT7W", "B000A6T1ZE", "B00KO7NUWO", "B00HZMZ2HM", "B0000639EV", "B001K2KM8C", "B00008RUYH", "B0000WN0SW", "B0031DDG90", "B00ATK02IG", "1574925628", "B003G715Q2", "B00BUWD7WA", "B000FJH5M2", "B006VJ1AAI", "B003JSSPSY", "B000E5N6B6", "1442459913", "B003EYVXXW", "B002GY9F9K", "B000MMMTD2", "B0056G1APW", "B00ECXJC28", "B001RXDM2M", "B00CFA222M", "B002U0KHME", "B007TBJUW2", "B005TZFZ6U", "B00HW3LAF2", "B004LROMS4", "B005TG8156", "B000056WR3", "B009DE6HW4", "B000XUUQRE", "B00IARA89S", "B005TK0MFE", "141650964X", "B001MVYUQG", "B00GM473M6", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B003PGNBO8", "B007SO31BG", "B001F0TM44", "B00DTRR43W", "B000NA28I4", "B000BCCAEQ", "B0009JE6G6", "B000ELL1QC", "B004P2VQZC", "B0057FGD2C", "B00GTZWZH6", "0547722044", "B007RMQ4MM", "B004XM38CS", "B0006FO9B0", "0689845367", "B00DBPBQ6I", "B00HGJAQ4I", "B0011FLGZQ", "B00HI9QDQ6", "B00J11U54K", "B0002J58GU", "B008JFUPPI", "B005LAIH54", "B000FIHN8O", "B003R0MEYA", "B001DW2BG0", "B00005JM39", "B008JFUNHI", "B000TXNDT8", "B000WMFZK6", "B001MEJY9G", "B00005U8QM"], "bought_together": ["B0007OCG5Q", "B00B04NIZO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00B04NIZO", "B0039PGH9G", "B003RHZ6IE", "0547773749"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 29267}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "Lions Gate Entertainment", "asin": "B00077BPA0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EXX59WJ7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Earthsea"}

{"description": "A misfit drama in the grand Southern (by way of Hollywood) tradition,A Love Song for Bobby Longtakes its cue from Carson McCullers'sThe Heart Is a Lonely Hunter. Re-establishing his indie-cred, John Travolta adds Bobby Long to his gallery of colorful characters. Hobbled by an infected toe, the 50-something Bobby is a white-haired, unshaven, vodka-soaked mess. But he&#x92;s also a former English professor, and the piles of books in his ramshackle house, and the authors he drunkenly quotes give him a wounded dignity. Just how wounded will be revealed over the course of this atmospheric tale of redemption and penance. Bobby lives with Lawson Pines (Gabriel Macht), his former teaching assistant who is writing a book about his mentor, a project deferred by drinking, sitting around with the locals, or engaging in quotation oneupsmanship. Scarlett Johansson (Lost in Translation,Ghost World) holds her own against Travolta (\"You are such a shameless ham,\" she chastises the loquacious Bobby) as Pursy, the estranged daughter of Lorraine, a recently deceased singer-songwriter in whose house Bobby and Lawson reside. A battle of wills between the two men and the headstrong young girl gives way to the formation of a tentative family unit. Pursy agrees to return to high school if Bobby and Lawson quit drinking. There will be the expected revelations, recriminations, and dramatic confrontations, but what makes thisLove Songresonate are the performances by a cast that rarely hits a false note.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000F3UAFC", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B000IU37SO", "B000EQHXNW", "1596921323", "B000VKL6T8", "B001RHGRT8", "B000QGEB1M", "B00K0MM4AM", "B001NY4WZ6", "B004H2P6II", "B00E1HIXEI", "B000K2UVZM", "B00IO03I6Q", "B00AEFYCW8", "B0006SST72", "B004MT3UBG", "B008XAT10E", "B0000AZT79", "B0001US61O", "B001DJ7PR8", "B0007VZ9D0", "B00005QW6V", "B00FRILRW0", "B00066VTVW", "B00HOGBXS6", "B0000WN15O", "B002S5N052", "B00FEDP5XK", "B00IARA8KM", "B006Z7Z3VS", "B00005JMJ4", "B00005O0SO", "B000ALM40I", "B001MUSQ80", "B000MXPE7O", "0618526412", "B008B9JTFO", "B00CUYMPLQ", "B00AEFYAC0", "B000QUCRB4", "B00AEFXZ76", "B004P7CNVS", "B00ET2ODTE", "B000JBWWQA", "B004P7CMUU", "B00CX7TOOG", "B00164KYV4", "0767821432", "630471193X", "B003UESJDI", "B0002JZT5A", "B00AEFXJ86", "B000056VZC", "B005Z9MGRG", "B001G9F9IW", "B005XB8T68", "0790734737", "B001QOGYFO", "B003Q6D200", "B00D3LA5WG", "B0020LH8WU", "B003ASLJK4", "B001CRC4DG", "B00009L1TA", "B00F8PTALC", "B009AJB0YM", "B00GNZM0D6", "B000QFCD7W", "B000OCZA04", "B002GOAGZC", "B00AMSLDWO", "B00000K31T", "B00005K3NV", "B000HIVSGU", "6305137323", "0792833279", "B0009OL7Z4", "B000065FJC", "B003Y5H4W0", "B004SEUJOQ", "B006ZGROB6", "B00ARA4SLU", "B003EYVXTG", "B000LC55F2", "B00AEBB9F0", "B000BTIU4S", "0783241909", "B0034GK78W", "B001570H5K", "6305428506", "B00005QAQD", "B0012QE4Q2", "B00CX7OWL6", "B0043X1FM2", "B0083QN87K", "B00005T30L", "B00AEFYCQO", "B0045O2PHS", "B000066C6F"], "bought_together": ["B000F3UAFC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008XAT10E", "B000EQHXNW", "1596921323", "B00FRILRW0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18275}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.37, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0007Q6VY6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G0XZWE8HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Love Song for Bobby Long"}
{"description": "Sean Penn (looking rather Rupert Pupkin-like) is Samuel Bicke, whose life, circa 1974, has become unbearable. His wife (Naomi Watts) has left him, his dead-end sales job is killing him--even his best friend (Don Cheadle) has had enough. Bicke's a loser, but at least he's an honest one. Nixon, the epitome of dishonesty, becomes the locus of his rage, so Bicke devises a plan to eliminate him. Paul Schrader claims he finished writingTaxi Driverbefore the real-life Byck attempted to assassinate the president. Maybe so, but the similarities are hard to ignore (and \"Bickle\" sounds a lot like \"Byck\"). Niels Mueller (Tadpole) doesn't disguise the fact that his debut was inspired by the guy. IfThe Assassination of Richard Nixondoesn't hitTaxi Driver's (admittedly lofty) heights, it's still a discomfiting look at a man determined to leave his mark on the world, only to become a footnote.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "From Hollywood's legendary Cocoanut Grove to the pioneering conquest of the wild blue yonder, Martin Scorsese'sThe Aviatorcelebrates old-school filmmaking at its finest. We say \"old school\" only because Scorsese's love of golden-age Hollywood is evident in his approach to his subject--Howard Hughes in his prime (played by Leonardo DiCaprio in his)--and especially in his technical mastery of the medium reflecting his love for classical filmmaking of the studio era. Even when he's using state-of-the-art digital trickery for the film's exciting flight scenes (including one of the most spectacular crashes ever filmed), Scorsese's meticulous attention to art direction and costume design suggests an impassioned pursuit of craftsmanship from a bygone era; every frame seems to glow with gilded detail. And while DiCaprio bears little physical resemblance to Hughes during the film's 20-year span (late 1920s to late '40s), he efficiently captures the eccentric millionaire's golden-boy essence, and his tragic descent into obsessive-compulsive seclusion. Bolstered by Cate Blanchett's uncannily accurate portrayal of Katharine Hepburn as Hughes' most beloved lover,The Aviatoris easily Scorsese's most accessible film, inviting mainstream popularity without compromising Scorsese's artistic reputation. As compelling crowd-pleasers go, it's a class act from start to finish.--Jeff ShannonDVD FeaturesIn his commentary track, director Martin Scorsese offers his own impressions of Howard Hughes and rattles off his memories of experiencing Hughes's films.  He mentions how he made Cate Blanchett watch every Katharine Hepburn film from the '30s on the big screen, and observes that Kate Beckinsale had \"a real sense of the stature of a Hollywood goddess.\"  But in general he doesn't talk much about the craft of making the film.  That area is covered better by editor Thelma Schoonmaker, who also appears on the commentary track, and producer Michael Mann makes a few appearances (all were recorded separately).  The picture is brilliant, but the 5.1 sound is not as aggressive in the rear speakers and subwoofer as one might expect, other than some nice surround effects in theHell's Angelsflying sequence.The second disc collects almost three hours of features.  There's one unnecessary deleted scene, and an 11-minute making-of featurette that's basically the cast and director heaping praise on each other.  More interesting are the short featurettes on visual effects (including the XF-11 scene, of course), production design, costumes, hair and makeup, and score, and Loudon Wainwright discusses his and his children's musical performances.  Historical perspective is provided by spotlights on Hughes's role in aviation and his obsessive-compulsive disorder, and a 43-minute Hughes documentary from the History Channel (part of the Modern Marvels series, it focuses on his mechanical innovations and spends less than a minute on his movies).  More unusual are DiCaprio and Scorsese's appearance on an OCD panel, and a half-hour interview segment DiCaprio did with Alan Alda.--David HoriuchiThe Personalities ofThe AviatorClick the links to explore more movies by these stars.Leonardo DiCaprioasHoward Hughes\"Sometimes I truly fear that I... am losing my mind.

{"description": "Dark Wateris Japanese horror auteur Hideo Nakata's return to the genre after hisRingcycle made you too scared to watch television ever again. WhereRingudealt with a supernatural force wreaking revenge via technology, this film is a much more traditional ghost story. After winning a custody battle for her daughter, single mother Yoshimi moves into what she thinks is the perfect apartment with her daughter Hitomi. No sooner have they unpacked than strange things begin to disturb their new life. A water leak from the supposedly abandoned apartment above gets bigger and bigger, a child's satchel reappears even though Yoshimi throws it away several times, and she is haunted by the image of a child wearing a yellow mackintosh who bears a striking resemblance to a young girl who disappeared several years before. The conventional narrative follows Yoshimi's increasingly desperate attempts to discover who or what force is haunting her daughter, but the story's execution is far from predictable. Nakata is the master of understated suspense: there's always a feeling of motiveless malignancy that runs like an undercurrent through his films--far more frightening than out and out shocks--and here he also practically drowns his audience in water imagery. The film is saturated; the relentless dripping in the apartment, the constant rain outside and the deliberately washed-out photography make any color, such as the yellow coat, seem incongruous and unsettling. Nakata also clears the film of unnecessary characters--this is an almost deserted Tokyo--preferring to concentrate the action on Yoshimi's rising hysteria as she struggles to understand what is happening and how to save her daughter. Granted, the special effects are somewhat unconvincing and the ending confused, but even so the result is a stylish and disquieting chiller that will do for bathtubs what hisRingfilms did for video recorders.--Kristen Bowditch", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000GSYRY6", "B000E0OE4O", "B00005JNJR", "B000GB5MOW", "B000LPS3B2", "B000H0M4CK", "B000E3LGMY", "B000A2XA8M", "B004O63TWW", "B00DW5IM14", "B000AWYOGE", "B000Q7ZKWU", "B000088NQR", "B0000AVHAO", "B000FS9FIA", "B003UTPL2A", "B000FVQYW2", "B000MEYKCI", "B000FZEQEQ", "B002P7UCJK", "B0000CC885", "B0009KQOZQ", "B0009WFEDC", "B000H5U5YO", "B000MM0LHS", "B0007XBM8O", "B000NO243E", "B000CSTKHE", "B0009X765K", "B0006SGYL0", "B000AAF25S", "B000MM0LH8", "B0018JKLT2", "B000GBEWNY", "B001KEGR66", "B000FZEQFK", "B0028DRGDQ", "B00BOYLIAC", "B000NA28GG", "B00136MBUW", "B0019X3YX2", "B00005LW4G", "B0002ZDW7Q", "B000CRR3ME", "B004P2VQZ2", "B0007CNY2W", "B0009YA3YA", "B000BVM240", "B00260LDSU", "B0009S2T0M", "B0002J4X20", "B002E2QH8G", "B00009MEC4", "B000FZEQVY", "B0000YAEHK", "B002U041OE", "B00HI9QDXO", "B001570H5K", "B00AEFYYH6", "B000NA21RM", "B0015ET3YO", "B0007GAG42", "B0009NCQL4", "B000F0UUMI", "B001VG2MAI", "B004H2CXBQ", "B00104AYG0", "B001MEJY8W", "B00125WAW8", "B000BGH2A4", "B000AM4PGI", "B001P3SA9Y", "B000EDWKZ6", "B0010SAGHS", "B000A2X3U2", "B0009W5KHW", "B000S0GYRU", "B00344EAM8", "B005D0RDPM", "B001221DUQ", "B0000CABGW", "B002OMIKSG", "B00BUBE2N4", "B008NNY8XQ", "B00019JR5Y", "B00AEFY2E6", "B0009XRZQK", "B006L4MWVE", "B00BOUXNNQ", "B00004W3HF", "B008G1JIQC", "B007I1Q4IG", "B000R7HY32", "B00GHH9IIA", "B0009X763M", "B00006AUIG", "B00009OWI1", "B0001EFV7M", "B000IMUYJM", "B0016MJ6KQ"], "bought_together": ["B000E0OE4O", "B000GSYRY6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000AWYOGE", "B00DW5IM14", "B000GSYRY6", "B0009WFEDC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 135749}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.99, "brand": "ADV Films", "asin": "B0009KA2UO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41KFCTBTH3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dark Water"}

{"description": "In the realm of revenge thrillers, you'd be hard pressed to find more ultra-violent vengeance and psycho thrills than in the creepy story ofOldboy. This Korean import made a pop splash at the Cannes Film Festival and during its limited theatrical run thanks to the imprimatur of Quentin Tarantino, who raved about it and its visionary director, Chan-wook Park, to anyone who would listen. It's easy to see why QT fell in love with the grindhouse attitude, fast-paced action, violent imagery, and icy-black humor, but it's a disservice to think ofOldboyas another Tarantino homage or knockoff. The darkly existential undercurrent in the themes thatOldboytraces over its life-long narrative arc is much more complex and deeply disturbing than anything of its kind. The movie's tagline is, \"15 years of imprisonment... 5 days of vengeance.\" The imprisonee is Oh Dae-Su, an ordinary Joe who is snatched off a Seoul street corner and locked away in a dank, windowless fleabag hotel room for the aforementioned 15 years. Just as abruptly he is released, and thus the five days begin. Why did this happen to Oh Dae-Su? Ah, but that would be telling, and in fact we don't know ourselves until the final wrenching scenes.Oldboybreaks into a classic three-act saga, the first of which details the hallucinatory period of imprisonment in which Oh Dae-Su wades from mild insanity to outright psychosis in the hands of unseen yet attentive captors. Act 2 is the revenge, when an entirely different tone takes over and Oh Dae-Su moves with single-minded purpose and clarity. It's this section that has gained the most notoriety, primarily for the claw-hammer dentistry scene, the one-man-army tracking shot, and the wriggling octopus that Oh Dae-Su consumes in a sushi bar (he's been dead so long he simply needs life back inside him in any way possible). In act 3, answers finally start to emerge and the sinister atmosphere grows even more profound--not without a healthy dose of extra bloodletting, of course.Oldboyis an undeniably poetic masterpiece of tension, fury, and dynamic craft. Ultimately, its epic cycle of tragedy is of the sort that mankind has been inflicting upon itself for all time. Some of the images may be gruesome, but all converge into a kind of beauty. It's in the telling of this lurid tale that these details become one and the memories of pain ultimately heal.--Ted Fry", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BGH2A4", "B000GBEWNY", "B004P2VQZ2", "B00GMV8IVE", "B002P7UCJK", "B006L4MWVE", "B003Y7F1IW", "B004H2CXBQ", "B000GSYRY6", "B0000CABGW", "B0009WFEDC", "B003JDQJM8", "B003NLE5JA", "B000GSE6H4", "B0085A9J18", "B004XQO8MS", "B00C6WHPO4", "B000CRR3ME", "B00J5LXST0", "B0009XRZQK", "B0006VL1J2", "B00HOGBXS6", "B005X7HA6C", "B00CG0YLS4", "B001I82RVS", "B006C1S1DY", "B0013D8LBI", "B001MEJY8W", "B00IKM5OCO", "B0009NZ78I", "B00JJ3EHCG", "1593075685", "B000PKG8TW", "B005B0ZF3Q", "B0036BDQBU", "B001570H5K", "B0034G4P30", "B000I0RNWU", "B00HI9QGWC", "B008OTTVC2", "B00003CXZ4", "B000N6TX1I", "B00IA1VQBS", "B00IKM5MIA", "B00GMV8IGO", "B00005JN7C", "B006L4MWTQ", "B00J5LXTUI", "B00A3TFMDI", "B00003CXUM", "B005ZMBEXU", "B00HEPC0TS", "B00G3HCG9M", "B00005JNJR", "B00E1LNDDU", "B00005K9O8", "B0064NTZQ2", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B00DPUB56U", "B000MEYKCI", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00125WATQ", "B00009W0U4", "B00EI3XAZC", "B008JFUN50", "B004SIP6GI", "B000NA28GG", "B004P2VQXO", "B0000633R6", "B00JA3RVG4", "B00008975Z", "B00H9HZITU", "B000065V38", "B00DPUB5EW", "B008G1JIQC", "B0000CC885", "B004P2VQXE", "B003KGBISE", "B005Y1B3EW", "B00005RYKV", "B0048LPRCS", "B00JJ3EH6C", "B0000AVHAO", "B00HSJ2EMI", "B00JVQ7PWU", "B00GMV8HX8", "B0055T3RSS", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B0040QYRTA", "1593075707", "B00DSQTMRA", "B00H9KKGTO", "B008220DGE", "B001FOPOD8", "B00J11U54K", "B00GPPXNIK", "B00I45844W", "B00DCRE9LY"], "bought_together": ["B000BGH2A4", "B000GBEWNY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00GMV8IVE", "B004P2VQZ2", "B00J5LXST0", "B002P7UCJK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17532}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 16.99, "brand": "", "asin": "B0009S2T0M", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5177K3F5Y0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Oldboy"}

{"description": "This first part ofEleanor and Franklin: The Early Years, the critically acclaimed 1976 television miniseries, focuses on the early lives of Eleanor and Franklin Roosevelt, concluding on their wedding day. The story is mostly told in flashback, as the first lady receives word of the death of President Roosevelt and, while making funeral preparations, reflects on her life with him. Distant relatives in the wealthy and sprawling Roosevelt family of New York, young Franklin and Eleanor met several times during their childhood, and much of the action in this installment of the drama utilizes young actors, including Mackenzie Phillips, who plays Eleanor at the age of 14. Playing the main characters as young adults, Edward Herrmann and Jane Alexander are brilliant in portraying the great American love story, as the privileged yet socially awkward Franklin finds himself completely captivated by the brainy and conscientious Eleanor. The miniseries was based on a Pulitzer Prize-winning book by historian Joseph P. Lash, and interspersed with the human drama are vignettes out of American history, such as cameo appearances by Eleanor's uncle Teddy, whose enormous personality suits his job as president of the United States.The second and concluding part of the miniseries focuses on Franklin D. Roosevelt's early career and the major role his wife played in overcoming profound difficulties in their marriage. Told mostly in flashback, the film features Edward Herrmann and Jane Alexander, whose performances in the title roles are uncanny. During World War I, the Roosevelts moved to Washington, D.C., where young Franklin, while serving in the Wilson administration, began having an affair with Lucy Mercer, his wife Eleanor's social secretary. Deeply wounded when she discovers his betrayal, Eleanor nonetheless stays with Franklin. And she would be at his side when, during a summer vacation with their five children, he was stricken with polio and paralyzed. Urged to take a more public role during his recuperation in the early 1920s, Eleanor touchingly admits, \"I'll never be any good at public speaking.\" In a scene in which Eleanor drives a roadster down a country road while rehearsing the speech she's on her way to give in rural New York State, Alexander beautifully captures Eleanor's determination to overcome her own shyness and become a champion of progressive politics.Eleanor and Franklin: The Early Yearswon 11 Emmy Awards, and its intelligent screenplay and fine acting have aged very well. It's a great love story as well as a great political story, an engaging drama made all the better by its historical resonance.--Robert J.

Kicked out of several apartments for her large brood, Keiko (Japanese pop star You) sneaks them in to a new one (two inside the suitcases) and goes over the house rules: No loud noises. They must stay hidden inside the apartment all day, every day. Only Akira, the oldest, leaves to do grocery shopping while she works. He also makes dinner while Keiko goes out on dates (implying to her children that she's looking for a rich husband so that they can all live in a big house together).One day, Keiko (not a villain, but an unsympathetic, helium-voiced child herself) announces she's going away for a few weeks to work. She soon emerges every few months, only to drop off money before taking off again, at one point, for good. Akira forgoes any normal 12-year-old's upbringing (even school) to play mother, father, even Santa Claus to his siblings. There's a trapped feeling inNobody Knows. For the younger kids, it's the inability to escape to the outside world. For Akira, it's seeing the outside world and knowing he has too many responsibilities to participate in it--when he tries, the results are disastrous. As the children grow up and resources become more scarce, the film's tenacity to show every painful detail of their existence slows the pace to almost a standstill. Still, it's a lovely, haunting tale beset with unforced performances from its young actors, particularly Yagira, who won the best actor prize at Cannes. --Ellen A.

{"description": "If there's such a thing assurreality TV, then Sacha Baron Cohen is da man, andDa Ali G Showis da bomb. Better known as his alter egos Ali G (the \"wanskta\" journalist), Borat (the clueless correspondent from Kazakhstan), and Bruno (the gay Austrian fashionista), Cohen is consistently hilarious in these six episodes (on two discs) from the 2003 season of his HBO show. With his cracked Cockney-Rasta patois (\"does you 'tink&#x85; \") and constant malapropisms (confusing \"incest\" with \"incense\" and \"bi-lingual\" with \"bi-sexual\"; calling MIT linguistics professor Noam Chomsky \"Norman\"), Ali G is the star. But so is the odd and, well, surreal assortment of folks he interviews in his relentless, \"Candid Camera\"-goes-hip-hop assault on the idiots and idiosyncrasies of American culture and politics. Some are at least partly complicit; Pat Buchanan, of all people, plays right along with the shtick, as does Immigration and Naturalization Service chief James Ziegler. Others are merely confused, like the doc who grows increasingly frustrated by Ali's inability to differentiate between \"veteran\" and \"veterinarian,\" newsman Sam Donaldson, or former LAPD chief Daryl Gates. But as absurd asDa Ali G Showgets, this isn'tJackass, and Cohen is no dummy. Along with all the goofing are some shrewd questions about abortion, teaching religion in schools, Iraq, and homeland security, to name a few (\"How come there ain't no security on trains?\" Ali G asks Ziegler, who laughs off the question&#x85; and then came the Madrid and London subway bombings). With a generous helping of extras (including Ali's commencement speech at Harvard!) along with the episodes,Da Ali G Showis a riot.

{"description": "House of Dis a bittersweet, moving story of an American expatriate's painful decision to come to terms with the childhood he fled in early 1970s New York City. David Duchovny wrote and directed this comedy-drama; he also stars as the adult version of the film's hero, Tom Warshaw, an illustrator who has spent most of his life in Paris and decides&#x97;on the occasion of his son's birthday&#x97;to finally reveal long-withheld facts about his past.The bulk of the story, told in flashback, portrays 13-year-old Tom (Anton Yelchin) as a quick-witted prince of his neighborhood, a delivery boy who knows every eccentric on his bicycle route and a Catholic school kid fond of playing pranks on his clueless French teacher and soulful principal (Frank Langella). His best friend is the school's mildly retarded, 41-year-old janitor, Pappas (Robin Williams), and his advisor on matters of the heart is Lady (Erykah Badu), a prison inmate whom the fatherless Tom (or Tommy, as he's called in 1973) can neither see nor touch. Tommy's vivacity is an asset at home, where his mother (Tea Leoni), a grieving widow with a mounting addiction to pills, is slipping away from her son's ability to help. Duchovny's screenplay sometimes borders on the precious: A number of scenes are enamored with their own boldness and originality, as if Duchovny has been squirreling away lots of colorfully expressive storytelling details for years, and unloaded them here. But that flaw all but disappears in the glow ofHouse of D's emotional resonance and honesty, not to mention several exceptional performances. Among these is Zelda Williams's work as Tommy's sage-beyond-her-years girlfriend, Melissa, whose name offers a suitable excuse to work a rather lovely Allman Brothers song into the soundtrack.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0019X3YTQ", "B0007XG4XW", "B0043X1FM2", "6305262128", "B00008L3U1", "B00005UQ9V", "B00J5JSV3A", "B000N4RAR4", "B00005V9HT", "B00175VSBC", "B00BX8PG5M", "B0002XNT1C", "B004SIP6VI", "B00007AJFD", "6304584210", "B00114XTHA", "B003EYVXOG", "6306012419", "B000085EFG", "B0019X3YUA", "B003IQBLSI", "B0000694XY", "B000BYA4IS", "B00000IQV7", "B000YV1Q2G", "B00AEFXGIY", "B004SUDQ72", "B003LR5BD0", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B0071HPOLK", "B002PI1NRO", "0788815466", "B001FACH7S", "B004ZJZQAQ", "B004SIP6C2", "B008220A62", "B00003CWS3", "B000B8QG22", "B004SIP7ZS", "B0009H97HG", "B003EYVXOQ", "B00007976U", "B005QX8U2Q", "B0013N2WFY", "B00079HZOS", "B00133KFGW", "B000FDEVA2", "B002QQ8HAG", "B00000J11D", "1558908404", "B000OYC7BW", "B00BTYRB3U", "B00AEFYMGO", "B006YTGL86", "B00003CXQ4", "B000M341SC", "B000035Z3C", "B000077VQ6", "B000286RP2", "B000LC5B7O", "B0000714C4", "B002GIBVVQ", "B000NO39FG", "B003B3O5K4", "B00CYQXCDK", "B00AEFYVZQ", "B00003CXE4", "B00003CX8N", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B000063US3", "B00DL46ZN8", "B0007X7044", "B001CIOCLC", "B0043X1FL8", "B001JIE7JC", "B009AMAL4Y", "B00CCXL9OE", "B000P5FH3K", "B00004Y62V", "B0009UZGIM", "B000957O82"], "bought_together": ["B0007XG4XW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007XG4XW", "B00BTYNXJG", "B0019X3YTQ", "B000UAE7KO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 175614}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.73, "brand": "LION&#39;S GATE ENTERTAINMENT", "asin": "B000ARFPNK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K4DAM9FWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "House of D"}
{"description": "The acknowledged inspiration forThe X-Files, and the basis for an updated 2005 network version,Kolchak: The Night Stalkerwas a short-lived 1974 series spun off from a pair of extremely popular made-for-TV movies about the supernatural adventures of dogged newspaper reporter Carl Kolchak (Darren McGavin). Though plagued by low ratings and critical brickbats, the show has cultivated a huge cult following over the past three decades, which has given rise to this three-disc set, which compiles all 20 episodes of the show. Though none of the episodic stories matches the suspense and writing strength of theNight StalkerorNight Stranglermovies, TV horror fans will appreciate the parade of interesting and inventive monsters encountered by Kolchak (including a witches' coven in \"The Trevi Collection\"; an Aztec cult in \"Legacy of Terror\"; a Hindu Demon in \"Horror in the Heights,\" which was penned by Hammer Films scribe Jimmy Sangster; and a headless biker in \"Chopper,\" an episode deemed in extreme poor taste by Stephen King and co-written by Robert Zemeckis, Bob Gale, andSopranoscreator David Chase). McGavin is of course topnotch as Kolchak, and he's well-matched by Simon Oakland as his hot-tempered boss; guest stars include Scatman Crothers, James Gregory, Phil Silvers, Eric Braeden, Tom Skerritt, and Richard Kiel as the monster in two back-to-back episodes.  Sadly, no extras accompany this fun collection of Kolchak's creepiest cases.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00026L7OU", "B000EOTV98", "B0002CX1M0", "B000FFJZO2", "B001DXS4DI", "B006TBYC76", "B0007CEXUY", "B004S8UTII", "B001HUHBBS", "B002FLOTPO", "B002QU1Z1K", "B003VJTGNE", "B004QC6HGY", "B000BOH8Z0", "B003NOGNQU", "B000EXDS2A", "B00KTZALDC", "B001CQONOA", "B000H1RFGO", "B008X8VM1W", "B005SQRYS2", "B008RJ6TTC", "B0019F02VW", "B0030E5PYO", "B0077T5SG8", "B000QUEQ4U", "B001CY5N00", "B00005JO3P", "B00023P4UQ", "B000AQKU72", "B0037AGB9O", "0783116926", "B000HEVZ94", "B00114XTHK", "B00005Q4D6", "B000E5N6B6", "B00125WAY6", "B0006UEVUE", "B0055CP9P4", "B00H7BJ0C4", "B000BOH986", "B003RHZ6CK", "B00E5G03I4", "B00CPR3RB0", "B00005JNHU", "B00023GGAI", "B000654YJW", "B007Q0JJD6", "B000CNE0SS", "B00005JN8Q", "B0002S94BQ", "B000BOH98G", "B004RBC5GK", "B004RBC5QU", "B00C25352Q", "B000BF0C8E", "B00005JOJE", "B008HSK3PE", "B006JN86V2", "B0096W46PS", "B004RBC5M4", "B00E3Q723A", "B000FJH5M2", "B00005JM3A", "B0007YMWGY", "B004RBC5KQ", "B000YENUOK", "B00023P4U6", "B001KZOVJK", "B00AK51Q8U", "B004RBC5HE", "B00EEEHLKU", "B00004WLW8", "B0088FS27C", "B0000C23T1", "B001HPOJ68", "B00013D54Y", "B001DHXT6G", "B00D9EJFZA", "B004IB04NU", "B004IF4EYQ", "0783233515", "B000N2HD6O", "B00IXPWGIS", "B00168OILM", "0767810864", "B0003JAOO0", "B000BOH990", "B000P6R9O4", "B005FQ2HBO", "B000AM6OQ2", "B00008CMR6", "0767817664", "B00005NSXY", "B001DHXT48", "B005XB8SWI", "B00009NHC0", "B004YPED14", "B005M2A4CA", "B004G9UXDK"], "bought_together": ["B00026L7OU", "B000EOTV98"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00026L7OU", "B000FFJZO2", "B000EOTV98", "B0002CX1M0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14109}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 24.95, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

{"description": "Sir Roger Bannister's historic running of the sub-four-minute mile is celebrated inFour Minutes, an inspiring and respectably authentic TV movie about breaking the most famous barrier in the history of sports. Although it was primarily filmed on locations near Toronto, Canada, this classy ESPN production effectively captures the melancholy mood of post-World War II England, which desperately needed a hero to lift the country out of its post-war depression. Stubbornly resistant to training, Bannister was a devoted Oxford medical student with only passing interest in athletics, but his surprising speed set the stage for his record-setting one-mile run (officially recorded as 3:59.4) at Oxford's modest Iffley Road track on the rainy and windy afternoon of May 6, 1954. As written by renowned sportswriter Frank Deford (based on his article \"Hillary and Bannister\") and directed by British TV veteran Charles Beeson, this handsome-looking film makes the most of its limited budget, and newcomer Jamie Maclachlan (a dead ringer for the real Bannister circa 1954) is perfectly cast, physically convincing as a world-class runner while effortlessly conveying Bannister's intelligent, congenial charm. Deford's teleplay is dryly conventional, with perfunctory parallels to Sir Edmund Hillary's 1953 conquest of Mount Everest (another inspirational British milestone), a fictional composite role for Christopher Plummer (doing fine work as Bannister's disabled coach) and a standard love interest (nicely played by Amy Rutherford, as the future Mrs. Bannister) for a touch of trackside romance. Comparisons toChariots of Fireare unavoidable, butFour Minutescan stand on its own, ensuring that Bannister's remarkable achievement will never be forgotten.On the DVDFour Minutesis accompanied by a variety of bonus features that provide a comprehensive record of Roger Bannister's historic running of the sub-four-minute mile.

{"description": "Blockbuster action director Michael Bay delivers a striking look at a strange world of the future in this sci-fi action drama. Midway through the 21st century, Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) lives in a confined indoor community after ongoing abuse of the Earth has rendered most of the planet uninhabitable. One of the only places in the outside world still capable of sustaining life is an idyllic island where citizens are chosen to live through a lottery. Or at least that's what Lincoln and his fellow citizens are taught to believe; the truth is that Lincoln, like everyone he knows, is actually a clone who is kept under wraps to provide needed organs when the person who supplied his or her DNA falls ill. When he becomes aware that his existence is a fraud, Lincoln escapes to the outside world with a fellow clone, Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson), though the powers that be are determined to see that no one gets away alive.The Islandalso stars Steve Buscemi, Djimon Hounsou, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Sean Bean.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767805712", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B0069UP2PI", "B00005JL78", "B0013PSTMC", "B004LWZW7E", "B004XQO90O", "B008JFUO36", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B00AEFXCLU", "B001GCUO02", "B0001NBNDY", "B002GIBVVG", "B00KHWSB5M", "B0018O4YT0", "B00005JLWN", "B0001CNRAM", "B002ZG98SW", "B00005JN0T", "B00K7IPFSM", "B00JPFTX5O", "B0009YA3OA", "B001CC7PLM", "B000AP04FG", "B005LAIIMG", "B005LAII8A", "B0013LL2Z2", "B002ZG980U", "B008JFUN50", "B00005JMWP", "B000EQHXNW", "B004WCTLNY", "B004EPYZOO", "B001GKJ2E8", "B007R6DJP8", "B00AEFXSLE", "B00AKGG8I2", "B000EZ908Y", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00BEIYIF0", "B0045HCJ8A", "B004LWZW4M", "B000BVM1S2", "B0067EKYAY", "B00AEBB8NI", "B001FB55HQ", "B00005JPAR", "B004LWZW42", "B001VLBDD0", "B0062P3392", "B000FS9FCG", "B008JFUPFI", "B00IKM5MIA", "B004A8ZX28", "B000056PMU", "B00005JPD0", "B005COLETU", "B003Q6D2B4", "B004EPYZSK", "B000P0J0EW", "B009AMAJPA", "B002SG7Z7A", "B00H83EUQW", "B000LC55F2", "B00DWZHTOU", "B005NKIPUY", "B005LAIHPE", "B000A2IPQY", "B00AEBB89W", "B0051MKNV8", "B005LAIIPS", "B001EAWMGA", "B00A7MSQRK", "6304711891", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B002GHHHOC", "B0021L8V0M", "B000P0I4O4", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AS1Q93S", "B00004XPPG", "B0045HCJFS", "B003UYUQZW", "B001OQCVI8", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00096S49Y", "B005LAIGRS", "B000EGDB10", "B002ZG984Q", "B000FGGE68", "B003L20IG0", "B0036TGSR6", "B0045HCJGC", "B002DU39GW", "B0002KVUKM", "B008JFUQZ2", "B000H30B2C", "0767803434", "B00AEBB8QK"], "bought_together": ["0767805712", "B0069UP2PI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004WCTLNY", "B004XQO90O", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B004SBQAN8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 95555}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.44, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B000BO0LH2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5133H8SZ04L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Island"}

{"description": "NowadaysDiff'rent Strokesis best known for producing three of the most troubled former child stars in the history of entertainment, but in its day this was a top-rated sitcom. Gary Coleman wasn't just a pair of cute chubby cheeks; he had the kind of wily comic timing that could have carried his career into adulthood--if his stardom hadn't been linked to his physique, making adult roles unacceptable to his audience.  ButThe Complete Second Seasoncaptures Coleman at his diminutive prime as Arnold Jackson, one of two brothers adopted by a wealthy New York developer named Philip Drummond (Conrad Bain,Maude). Bain and Charlotte Rae (as housekeeper Mrs. Garrett, who left mid-season to anchor the spin-offThe Facts of Life) delivered their lines and got out of Coleman's way; Dana Plato (as Drummond's daughter Kimberly) and Todd Bridges (as Arnold's brother Willis) acted their young hearts out, but Coleman was unquestionably the star.A runaway success and pop culture phenomenon, the second season ofDiff'rent Strokespulled in celebrity sports stars like Muhammad Ali, Reggie Jackson, and Meadowlark Lemon, while great character actors like Dabney Coleman (Nine to Five) and James Cromwell (Babe,Six Feet Under) appeared in memorable roles. The crossover episodes with justly forgotten McLean Stevenson sitcomHello, Larryare regrettable (though Coleman had great chemistry withHello, Larry's husky-voiced Kim Richards, formerly the star ofEscape from Witch Mountain), while the appearance of theFacts of Lifecast (including a very young Molly Ringwald, prior to her teen queen reign as star ofThe Breakfast ClubandPretty In Pink) fits right in. Social topics like racism and poverty are treated with firm liberal denouncement, but the difficulties of adolescence sometimes get slightly more subtle treatment (comparatively, at least). The only complaint aboutThe Complete Second Seasonis the complete lack of extras; but even without interviews or commentaries, these episodes--returned to their original broadcast length--will delight fans.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002JZT5U", "B007RMQ4HW", "B008VIMLRI", "B000EQ45BU", "B000HIVIOC", "B000OVLBH6", "B00465I1D8", "B001993YB8", "B003XL6EI0", "B0007OCG74", "B000C6NPHC", "B001DSNELU", "B00008R9MC", "B000CELOW2", "B0016MJ73W", "B004GJYR82", "B004NJC0IO", "B000G0O5JG", "B002JH2EHO", "B000AMJG5I", "B000068V9X", "B004ZKKL1Y", "B0001Z3I1C", "B00L89VLZU", "B00CVB6XDO", "B005XLFB32", "B0000ZMH92", "B000SQFC0O", "B00005JO2V", "B000K7UBXE", "B0002O7Y8U", "B000Y7U9AK", "B00G3BRC24", "B0089BSLKS", "B000MEYKAA", "B00BWQU0RY", "B00008EYBH", "B009X919YU", "B00JDCP0QA", "B009TTGLJ2", "B00005JNIS", "B0009X7BF0", "B001DSNEME", "B000CELOVI", "B00020X83Y", "B0006SSNKA", "B00IYJHAUC", "B006WEYOF0", "B0002RQ3MU", "B0009W5KJU", "B001NPK5BU", "B000Q6GUJS", "B000UX6TKM", "B000MGBSEY", "B0017VG690", "B0002DB5N6", "B00B58FVBY", "B00BUWD7NE", "B00DJYK1XU", "B000291Q3Y", "B001NY4X3W", "B000E3L7EQ", "B000M343AS", "B00005JOQZ", "B00D2UMHB0", "B0010IOALQ", "B000068V9Y", "B000FI8MQG", "B000NJMJHA", "B000FJAAHY", "B00LMKKY2Q", "B000VWQU88", "B00GOC75V0", "B0002I837M", "B00E96AWY0", "B0002Y4T7O", "B000M343AI", "B007JNZYPM", "B000EU1QC2", "B001GP5TMW", "B000FA57U8", "B00GC2KI2U", "B0000DFZ5O", "B000OVLBGW", "B0006VL1JM", "B0050MB5AC", "B0006BAWSI", "B000H1RFXM", "B0000AKY3Q", "B00I099K4U", "B00DXLO0BI", "B00005JO4F", "B000ASDFIQ", "B000EWBKP8", "B000286S42", "B00007KK5I", "B00CL152AY", "B0096RC57O", "1603994173", "B002ACKBTG"], "bought_together": ["B0002JZT5U", "B007RMQ4HW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002JZT5U", "B007RMQ4HW", "B008VIMLRI", "B000EQ45BU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 35845}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 10.6, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000CCBCCQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51wDyvOpuNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Diff'rent Strokes - The Complete Second Season"}

Equipped with the ability to feel human emotions but lacking the knowledge of how to handle them,3rd Rock's Dick (John Lithgow), Sally (Kristen Johnson), Harry (French Stewart), and Tommy (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), take instructions from leader, Big Giant Head, but are often left to make sense out of chaos, creating settings for optimal comic effect. Masterfully written by co-creators Bonnie and Terry Turner (That 70s Show),3rd Rock&#x92;s original combination of smart wit and slapstick comedy is still hilarious ten years after the show's inception.The third season delves into core human experiences, namely love and fear. In a two-part episode kicking off the season, Dick is assigned a wife (Rosanne Barr) by Big Giant Head, disrupting his plan to marry his true love, human and co-star, Mary Albright (Jane Curtin). During a series of rude awakenings occurring over several episodes, Dick learns in trial-by-fire fashion that human trust isn't easily won back, as Mary repeatedly rejects his apologies for not confessing his secret. Subplots about Dick's attraction to Venusians and his hookup with a human woman (Auto Erodicka) temper his heartbreak with whimsical commentary on humankind's sexual nature. Highlights include the Halloween special \"Scaredy Dick,\" in which the cast dress up, and Dick goes as a pirate to disguise his fear of getting a doctor's check-up. Also brilliant is \"Just Your Average Dick,\" featuring a cameo appearance by John Cleese, who shows the aliens that there's more to being human than simply fitting in.--Trinie Dalton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B007C8RZR4", "B0058EE6O4", "B00A2XQU7M", "B00A2XQTVY", "B0058EE6NK", "B0000ZMH8S", "B000DZ854A", "B000FBH3WW", "B000MGTQ6Q", "B00KO72WU0", "B008XJM7D8", "B000MGBLFK", "B00GOC74QG", "B00B04NJ1M", "B007C8RZL0", "B00B04NII6", "B003498RRM", "B0058JEHSO", "B001D2WUDE", "B0058JEHTS", "B000VZADPQ", "B0001Z3I0S", "B008L0YMZA", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B007C8RZQ0", "B000ERVK6W", "B009LDD1X0", "B008L0YMWS", "B00009Y3RW", "B0058EE6OO", "B001BNFR6M", "B000UX6TLG", "B005CGI4EG", "B0002I837M", "B008L0YN18", "B00IFK7ONI", "B001MVYUSO", "B000QFCDAO", "B000M343B2", "B00IFK7O5G", "B002TQKL16", "B001TKJDNA", "B000NA78SE", "B000A7Q1YC", "B00BUWD7Y8", "B002PQ7JR4", "B000G1R3A8", "B00B04NJ12", "B00GOC75Y2", "B0002I84FS", "B00008972G", "B0006N2EZK", "B009LDCVJU", "B00B04NIOU", "B000JBWWQK", "B00GO78384", "B000FTC1GW", "B002FLOTFO", "B000EBGFQI", "B00A2XQTF0", "B000A0GOQ4", "B001B9LWME", "B00IFK7OFG", "B00BUWD7E8", "B0056GLNQI", "B0009WFEEG", "B000HRMAUY", "B0002UE1WQ", "B000KX0IPO", "B000957O8C", "B0053O89WY", "B008L0YN6I", "B00005JLYW", "B000OHZKZ4", "B0000ALPJN", "B0081QF6WW", "B000YKYT1M", "B005PPMHWE", "B0058EE6NA", "B0024FAD9M", "B00DXLO086", "B000FBH3WM", "B000F6II1M", "B00HW3LG3S", "B0002NY8GW", "B000AJJNIQ", "B000Q6GUJS", "B000EXDS7K", "B0025KVNOU", "B007USE5CE", "B004H4AD1Q", "B0001907BW", "B00008YGS0", "B00FEVZ960", "B001HUHBD6", "B000RGULLA", "B0001BS3IY", "B0009YCLBS", "B00BM2JVAA", "B0001906X6"], "bought_together": ["B007C8RZR4", "B0058EE6O4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BM2JVAA", "B0058EE6NK", "B00A2XQU7M", "B0058EE6O4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 155977}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 25.9, "brand": "", "asin": "B000CEXF6A", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y9MD9ZHGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "3rd Rock from the Sun: Season 3"}

Charlize Theron (Monster) plays Josey Aimes, who goes to work at a Minnesota steel mine after splitting with her violent husband.Frances McDormand and CharlizeTheron inNorth Country.But the job proves to be almost as harrowing as her marriage; the male miners, resentful of women taking jobs, verbally abuse and play humiliating pranks on the female miners. After being physically assaulted by a coworker, Josey tries to fight against the harassment, but none of the other women will join her case for fear that things will only get worse.North Country, directed by Niki Caro (Whale Rider), makes the women's experience palpable for the audience without overdoing it. But the lawsuit is only part of the movie; the gut impact ofNorth Countrycomes from the devastating effect the lawsuit has on Josey's family, friends, and coworkers--thanks to an incredible ensemble cast that includes Sissy Spacek (In the Bedroom), Sean Bean (Lord of the Rings), Richard Jenkins (Six Feet Under), Woody Harrelson (The People vs. Larry Flynt), and the always powerful Frances McDormand (Fargo,Mississippi Burning). The courtroom histrionics don't always ring true, but the family conflict is riveting and deeply moving.

{"description": "On the surface, David Cronenberg may seem an unlikely candidate to directA History of Violence, but dig deeper and you'll see that he's the right man for the job. As an intellectual seeker of meaning and an avowed believer in Darwinian survival of the fittest, Cronenberg knows that the story of mild-mannered small-town diner proprietor Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) is in fact a multilayered examination of inbred human behavior, beginning when Tom's skillful killing of two would-be robbers draws unwanted attention to his idyllic family life in rural Indiana. He's got a loving wife (Maria Bello) and young daughter (Heidi Hayes) who are about to learn things about Tom they hadn't suspected, and a teenage son (Ashton Holmes) who has inherited his father's most prominent survival trait, manifesting itself in ways he never expected. By the time Tom has come into contact with a scarred villain (Ed Harris) and connections that lead him to a half-crazy kingpin (William Hurt, in a spectacular cameo), Cronenberg has plumbed the dark depths of human nature so skillfully thatA History of Violencestands well above the graphic novel that inspired it (indeed, Cronenberg was unaware of the source material behind Josh Olson's chilling adaptation). With hard-hitting violence that's as sudden as it is graphically authentic, this isA History of Violencethat's worthy of serious study and widespread acclaim.--Jeff ShannonOn the DVDOn a single disc and with little fanfare, this DVD makes an excellent case for the best extras of the year. Dive into the one-hour-long documentary and learn more about moviemaking than on many a double-disc. The secret lies in director David Cronenberg's (and his usual crew) folksy casualness in showing off the craft, be it makeup (green screens were used), directing (Cronenberg doesn't storyboard), or art direction (the diner set). It also is very funny to hear about \"fish Fridays\" and how Maria Bello's Uncle Pete became an influence. Even the infamous sex-on-the-staircase scene is diagnosed with candor as stars Viggo Mortensen and Bello act as if there is no backstage camera. There's only one deleted scene, but it's uncommonly deconstructed on why it was filmed and why it was cut (it's a very Cronenbergian dream sequence). A short bit on Cannes is also a delight. So much is here that Cronenberg's smart commentary track is nearly superfluous.

{"description": "For its third year, the Remington Steele Detective Agency decides to take a well-deserved rest on the French Riviera (season premiere \"Steele at It\"). Laura Holt (Stephanie Zimbalist) has a hidden agenda. She's hoping to strengthen her relationship with Steele (Pierce Brosnan), but they soon get caught up in aTo Catch a Thief-styled caper. In an attempt to help a friend, Steele briefly returns to his criminal origins and swipes a jewel-encrusted dagger (which he was intending to return), but it takes Laura to extract him--and loyal assistant Mildred Krebs (Doris Roberts)--from the chaos that ensues. After that fiasco, the private eyes decide not to mix business with pleasure--despite the obvious attraction between them. So the romance cools a bit, but the most highly-rated season heats up with more exotic locales (and a greater emphasis on humor). After France, the trio travels to Malta (\"Maltese Steele,\" \"Puzzled Steele\"), Las Vegas (\"Diced Steele\"), and Brosnan's native Ireland (\"Steele Your Heart Away\"). As with the second year, there's a new title sequence (a James Bond-type graphic replaces the movie house scenario). Naturally, some things remain the same, such as Steele's frequent film references, i.e.The Thin Man(\"Gourmet Steele\"),Arsenic and Old Lace(\"Let's Steele a Plot\"), andThe Producers(\"Springtime for Steele\").Guests during the 1984-1985 season, include Ray Wise (\"A Pocketful of Steele\"), John Larroquette (\"Breath of Steele'), Geena Davis and Jean Smart (\"Steele in the Chips,\" co-written by Zimbalist), and Zimbalist's father, Ephrem, as Steele's old pal, Daniel Chalmers (\"Blue Blooded Steele\"). Several living legends also drop by, like Yankee greats Mickey Mantle and Whitey Ford (\"Second Base Steele\") and the glittering Hollywood trio of Dorothy Lamour, Virginia Mayo, and Lloyd Nolan (fan favorite \"Cast in Steele\").--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Written, composed, and directed by Indian master Satyajit Ray (Pather Panchali),The Chess Playerspresents a stylized world in which the landed gentry lounge about, endlessly pulling on hookahs and engaging in the \"king of games.\" Outside their gilded doors, the order that allows them this luxury--let alone their marriages--is crumbling. They couldn't be more oblivious. As the narrator notes, \"Mr. Meer and Mr. Mirza are only playing at warfare. Their armies are pieces of ivory. Their battlefield: a piece of cloth.\" Set in 1856 Lucknow, the noblemen (Saeed Jaffrey and Sanjeev Kumar) are situated in one of the few Indian territories not ruled by Britain's East India Company. The British, meanwhile, are also playing a game of chess, and equally oblivious Oudh ruler Nawab Wajid Ali Shah (Amjad Khan) is the king they intend to capture. Forthright General Outram (Sir Richard Attenborough,Ghandi), assisted by the more culturally erudite Captain Weston (Tom Alter), is the man charged with the task. It shouldn&#x92;t be difficult: Like Meer and Mirza, Wajid would prefer to relax--to write poetry, to fly kites--rather than to rule. Along the way, Oudh will fall, but the chess will continue. Based on a story by Munshi Premchand,The Chess Playerswas Ray&#x92;s most elaborate production. It was also his first in Hindi (with English) and its frames are filled with music, dance, opulent pageantry, and humorous banter--even a lively animated sequence. Behind the attractive fa&#xE7;ade, however, lies a lament for lost opportunities.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Loosely based on the classic Russian playThree Sisters,The Sisterstakes Anton Chekov's tale of failed marriages, stunted yearnings, and ordinary unhappiness and injects it with drug addiction, closeted homosexuality, and incest. Three daughters of a noted academic scholar find their lives falling apart: Marcia (Maria Bello,A History of Violence) loathes her psychologist husband and falls into the arms of a visiting old friend (Tony Goldwyn,Ghost); Olga (Mary Stuart Masterson,Fried Green Tomatoes) has turned brittle and secretive, despite a successful career; and Irene (Erika Christensen,The Upside of Anger), the baby of the family, finds herself engaged to a man she doesn't love (Chris O'Donnell,Kinsey). Meanwhile, their hapless brother Andrew (Allesandro Nivolla,Junebug) has married a brassy, vulgar woman all three sisters despise (Elizabeth Banks,Heights).

{"description": "Jeannie (Barbara Eden) is even more fetching in color in the second season of one of TV's most charming and endearing fantasies.  Jeannie's navel is still not ready for prime time, and her live-in relationship with astronaut Tony Nelson (Larry Hagman), the man who freed her from that bottle, is still strictly platonic. But, like any wife, she is upset when Tony forgets their one-year anniversary in the season opener. And when Tony unwittingly frees the Blue Djinn, who originally imprisoned Jeannie, it looks like he won't survive year two.  Naturally, being stuck in a bottle for 2,000 years, the vivacious and playful Jeannie is more innocent and naive than her bewitching counterpart,Samantha Stevens. Her well-intentioned magic complicates Tony's life in such episodes as \"My Master, the Rich Tycoon,\" \"My Master, the Rainmaker\" and \"My Master, the Spy.\" She transforms Tony into an operatic virtuoso in \"My Master, the Great Caruso,\" landing him in a talent show, and leading to perhaps the most versatile lip-syncing scene since the Stooges sang the sextet fromLuciainMicro-Phonies. Jeannie blinks Tony back into the Old West in \"Fastest Gun in the East,\" on Captain Kidd's ship in \"My Master, the Pirate,\" and back to Napoleon's court in \"My Master, Napoleon's Buddy.\" No wonder that in \"There Goes the Best Genie I Ever Had,\" he considers taking advantage of Hajii Day and sending her back.Not that there aren't advantages to having a genie around the house. In one episode, she anticipates TiVo by freezing the action on a televised football game while she and Tony go out. In \"The Greatest Invention in the World,\" she fulfills Tony's best friend Roger's (Bill Daily) childhood wish to be the funniest man in the world by turning him into the one and only Groucho Marx. And when Tony is put in charge of providing entertainment for General Peterson's anniversary party, Jeannie summons \"The Greatest Entertainer in the World,\" Sammy Davis Jr. (at his konk-ch-konk best). The season's most captivating story arc begins in the two-parter \"The Girl Who Never Had a Birthday,\" as Tony and Roger resolve to determine Jeannie's birthday (the date is finally revealed in \"Caruso\"). Through it all, poor base psychiatrist Dr. Bellows (Hayden Rorke) is constantly confounded, Mrs. Kravitz-style, by the unexplained supernatural behavior to which he is witness.I Dream of Jeannieis far from PC, but in the realm of TV's guilty pleasures, it is master of its domain.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000KLQUSK", "B000E33VZ4", "B000RXZL0E", "B000TD48SI", "B000ASDFIQ", "B000E3L7FK", "B0009B16TO", "B000HIVIOM", "B000PISZ86", "B0014FAIYS", "B00280QNKG", "B001LRTT30", "B00AIA89OQ", "B0050MB5AC", "B001BN4WHW", "B000B6CODY", "B0006BAWSI", "B0072BNJ0I", "B0007V6IWQ", "B00JPQ1HXO", "B000E3L7EQ", "B001DZOCZU", "0307886948", "B000G0O5J6", "B001LRTT3A", "B000B5XOUM", "B00009VRF0", "B004K63PUW", "B0009OUBPQ", "B000M343AI", "B001LM64VK", "B00HW3L9MG", "B000BITV1A", "B000A0GORS", "B002ACKBU0", "B00DXLO086", "B001NRPQKI", "B00DXLO0D6", "B000G0O5JG", "B000EQ46HI", "B008LC8RQ8", "B000BT96OG", "B000CCBCHQ", "B0009I7NH6", "B000A6T1J0", "B00A2L1CKO", "B000MGBSH6", "B00096S480", "B000CCBCCQ", "B002WIDRLC", "B001992NXI", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B00008EY6N", "B000068V9X", "B000IHYXIK", "B001DHE9FQ", "B001UXJGII", "B003IRUFCU", "B000BOH8YQ", "B000FSME1K", "B000QUEQ6I", "B0007KIFK0", "B00005JLIC", "B000FDFSH2", "B00JAD6BYW", "B0000V4906", "B0002T7YYO", "B00JEZWRE4", "B0006TPE1U", "B0009B16TY", "B000UX6TKM", "B0006Z2L4W", "B000291Q3Y", "B0002ZMHVI", "B001OXLGK0", "B0011NVC9S", "B00IYRLUAU", "B0002JZT5U", "B000CCBCK8", "B00080ZG2E", "B001DHXT4I", "B008L36520", "B000EQ5PTQ", "B000EXDS02", "B0002NY8PI", "B0009UC7MK", "B000YKYT1M", "B0000DFZ5O", "B002LCOHPE", "B0007939QG", "B00005JNS8", "B008L3653O", "B00008EYBH", "B0041SI7B6", "B001E6JC26", "B002WIDRL2", "B001RXDM22", "B000AMJG5I"], "bought_together": ["B000E33VZ4", "B000RXZL0E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DXLO0D6", "B000E33VZ4", "B000KLQUSK", "B000RXZL0E"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 70718}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 15.63, "brand": "Columbia Tri Star", "asin": "B000FI8MQG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51zgk7YZ-6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "I Dream Of Jeannie - The Complete Second Season"}

{"description": "Helen Mirren's Elizabeth I could almost be cousin to her Jane Tennison. Like the dedicated detective chief inspector, Queen Bess is not without a heart, but work comes first and any romantic entanglements are doomed to fail. Fortunately, she has her friendships. Directed by Tom Hooper (Prime Suspect 6), this two-part HBO/Channel 4 tele-film begins in 1579. The Virgin Queen has been on the throne for 20 years, but has not married. Her closest relationship is with Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester (Jeremy Irons), whom the council will not allow her to wed. Because Robert wishes to produce an heir, he marries another, garnering Elizabeth's disfavor (and nor is he all that thrilled about her dalliance with Henry, the Duke of Anjou). In time, he'll return to her good graces. As she explains, \"Friendship outlasts love and is stronger than love.\" Then, as his health begins to fails, she'll turn to his stepson, the dashing, if duplicitous Robert Devereaux, the Earl of Essex (Hugh Dancy, the Hooper-directedDaniel Deronda). Meanwhile, Mary, Queen of Scots (Barbara Flynn) plots against her Protestant cousin. Even after Mary makes her exit, plenty of other powerful Catholics will stop at nothing to seize the crown. Marked as much by triumph as tragedy, the role of Elizabeth I has been catnip for many illustrious actresses, notably Bette Davis, Glenda Jackson, and Cate Blanchett. Mirren's multi-faceted portrayal of the queen's golden years is a worthy addition to that canon and Irons is a particularly formidable foil.--Kathleen C.

Lola (Chiwetel Ejiofor)--a drag queen also known as Simon--finds her shoe salvation in straight-laced Charlie Price (Joel Edgerton), who has inherited his father's shoe factory. Unable to pay the bills making traditional loafers and wingtips, Charlie agrees to make Lola a pair of kinky boots that turn out to be so fabulous the pair end up going into business together. They face a few obstacles, such as the bawdy union workers who aren't too keen on taking orders from a drag queen who's more of a man than they are. Then there's Charlie's posh real estate girlfriend, who wants to convert the factory into pricey condos. While the movie doesn't provide any real surprises (or even any scenes as suggestive as its title might suggest), the English film (which is loosely based on a true story) is highly entertaining that will delight fans of both comedy and shoes.--Jae-Ha Kim", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00C81AVNU", "B0000714BP", "B004VJJGFG", "0792843983", "B00005QW5X", "0792833198", "B00005JN1K", "6305622914", "B00KRFE9UK", "B0001HAGRE", "B000BZISX0", "B00DW5IJR6", "B004AR4W4O", "B0001I55M4", "B000X1Z0BU", "B00CQUNSJM", "B00003CXPD", "B0015RRN84", "B00K2CHUPY", "B00JJRLG7G", "B00004RCVM", "B001LPWGBY", "B001C5LLMI", "B0000ARD7O", "B000UYBP7S", "B0000JD29M", "B00D2UMHIS", "B00000HZFP", "B000R7G9JW", "B000I2J6YG", "B00A92MGLA", "B00008UALE", "B00IBQ5M1W", "B005S9EJ14", "B000067D0Y", "B0030Y0I1Y", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00G35R9ZK", "B00JAOW3MA", "B004MRX8D8", "B00005QCTZ", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B00J2T18EW", "B00AAIDNL0", "B009NYF2GQ", "B005S9EJ46", "B00J89SH4A", "B00DL46ZN8", "B00JAQJNN0", "B001QUF3SW", "146831002X", "B00006D295", "B007I1TFK0", "B00AZMFO6I", "B00003CXMY", "B000ZM1MG4", "B0050PYNP8", "B00KO76FSA", "B004CWLRF4", "B007FEHA34", "B00IC13UCY", "B00004U104", "B00F0JGA6E", "B001P5HI4A", "B007XTDWKQ", "B004X1M4DS", "B004ZJZPZC", "B00782O7IY", "B00CC0AWV8", "B000HT3PGU", "B00EIBO8T6", "B00JVQ7RK0", "B00BNWWYE4", "B00GWWV1XU", "B002ZG976U", "B001M5UDGS", "B00004W5VC", "B00IZ7ZC3A", "B00IXD2N1K", "B00BEIYHO2", "B00DJYJPLO", "B00AFEY354", "B00JK5C46E", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B00EIL7E9C", "B00HNTUR6S", "B0041PSQF6", "B000Z8GZYW", "B00005JOZC", "B00001PE59", "B00JM5CAHA", "B000077VR3", "B00GTO6WXU", "B00GHP8SH4", "B00DC8O6T8", "B006ZKAG3U", "B00AEBB8OC", "B0000A02TZ", "B00006ADFM"], "bought_together": ["B0000714BP", "0792833198"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000714BP", "0792833198", "B00C81AVNU", "0792843983"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 19802}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.79, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B000GFLE1S", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RX3EACH1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Kinky Boots"}
{"description": "Hamish Macbethmay technically be a British mystery series, but the quirky BBC show, set in Scotland, is moreLocal HeromeetsNorthern Exposurethan Miss Marple, as series 2 shows. The residents of tiny Lochdubh, Scotland, are an eccentric bunch, and actor Robert Carlyle, for better or worse, is the town's sole lawman/sheriff. Carlyle is in prime deadpan form in the role of Hamish Macbeth, who presides over the crimes and just plain weird happenings of the burgh. The series, based on characters created by M.C. Beaton, doesn't always even seem to feature a mystery, until the final moments of an episode, as in \"A Perfectly Simple Explanation.\" The episode features slightly manic members of a fundamentalist sect, the Church of the Stony Path, and Hamish comes under their fire-and-brimstone curses for living out of wedlock with his insecure girlfriend, Alex. Then there's the new age cult leader who conducts his conversations on a particularly sloshy waterbed. The oddball characters come and go, and somewhere, woven around their interactions, is a plot that becomes strangely satisfying by an episode's finale, but which is not at all the reason for watching. The steadfast but affectionate take on the residents' quirkiness is compulsively addictive, and Carlyle proves again what a talented, multifaceted actor he is. As the blustery minister shrieks at Macbeth about the sin and wantonness of his town, Carlyle never lets Macbeth show he's ruffled. \"If the Lord thinks so much of you,\" he says, when the reverend pauses to catch his breath, \"then why is He lettin' me dog wee on your leg?\" Visit Lochdubh and you'll likely never want to leave.--A.T.

{"description": "The love life of a woolly mammoth--handled with G-rated delicacy--drives this sequel to the first computer-animated romp in the age of prehistoric mammals. While the firstIce Agetook a delightful premise and suffocated it with a formulaic plot--in which a mammoth named Manfred (voiced by Ray Romano,Everyone Loves Raymond), a sloth named Sid (John Leguizamo,Moulin Rouge!), and a sabre-tooth tiger named Diego (Denis Leary,Rescue Me) helped an abandoned human infant return to its tribe (basically,Three Mammals and a Baby)--the sequel takes the now-familiar setting, gives it a shapeless, episodic storyline, and yet somehow becomes pretty darn entertaining. Faced with the threat of a flood from melting ice, our heroic trio are on the run to escape from their blossoming valley. On the way, they meet a female mammoth (Queen Latifah,Bringing Down the House) who thinks she's an opossum and get menaced by some freshly defrosted carnivo!  rous fish. Add into the mix a herd of lava-worshipping mini-sloths, some Busby Berkeley-style vultures, and more ingenious slapstick featuring the acorn-crazed Scrat, andIce Age: The Meltdownwill amuse even jaded adults. --Bret FetzerBeyondIce Age: The MeltdownIce Age - Super Cool EditionIce Age & Ice Age 2: The Meltdown - (DVD 2-Pack)Funtastic Adventures Collection Box Set (Ice Age / Robots / Fern Gully / Once Upon a Rainforest)Stills fromIce Age: The Meltdown(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001GCUNWQ", "B005LAIISA", "B0006UEVT0", "B005QODEEE", "B000AY74OG", "B001NCDFTW", "B004HO6I4M", "B000UVKGPI", "B000MV9026", "B00005JMQZ", "B005LAIHW2", "B00CWM58WY", "B0039N74CW", "B0006JMLRK", "B00005JNQS", "B00CHVJODE", "B002WJI2QQ", "B002ZG9904", "B000L22SG6", "B00365F6I2", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B0042U94UQ", "B008JFUQ16", "B000M343BC", "B001ECQ75A", "B001DPHDCY", "B00JK531ES", "B0013FSWT2", "B001GCUO7A", "B001FTIJS0", "B001GCUNW6", "B0012EM5D8", "B00G5G7EXY", "B009PPO78W", "B00005JNS0", "B00E00OGE2", "B00E9ZATJO", "B0030IIZ4M", "B00007LVCM", "B0030IIYYS", "B000VBJEEG", "B000FQISFS", "B00ALMNCLQ", "B004EPZ034", "0783231474", "B00003CXJ4", "B002ZG97YM", "B00AFEX83C", "B00F522C7C", "B000H7JCK0", "B0046A9RMM", "B00HLTD2OE", "B0013FSL3E", "B00947N6D8", "B001U3D88M", "B001PR0YEE", "B00275EHJG", "B001HN6918", "B00GRZPQCO", "B004EPZ0AC", "B008YWY0HK", "B0090SI1RM", "B004G600A4", "B001HN6922", "B0000AOX0O", "B00LG6YEKE", "B003TJM6I8", "B0000VV4W2", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B00005JN4W", "B00EV1YZ96", "B004LWZW7Y", "B00029LO0Y", "B004HO6HXY", "B001OMU6UM", "B002XODB66", "B000SJQQPQ", "B005LAIH4A", "B00AEFXMSS", "B000BITUVG", "B000RMJ4F8", "B005F96UJ6", "B005SDUV4E", "B003Y5H5AG", "B004EPZ048", "B001APZMJS", "B009PQCR74", "B003H9M1Q2", "B0000CABKY", "B000AAF1TU", "B00004R99F", "B00CTQWJEI", "B00EPH8SFI", "B0000AK7AA", "B003UESJF6", "B00EBBGLFC", "B0034G4OYA", "B005KG4EFG", "B00H7KJTMG"], "bought_together": ["B001GCUNWQ", "B005LAIISA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005LAIISA", "B001GCUNWQ", "B0006UEVT0", "B00CWM58WY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30729}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.4, "brand": "Fox Home Entertainment", "asin": "B000GUJYZQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518KJJQ5ZNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ice Age - The Meltdown (Full Screen Edition)"}

{"description": "Considered by many the finest screen adaptation of Shakespeare&#x92;s greatest work, Grigori Kozintsev&#x92;s HAMLET is a spare, haunting interpretation based on a translation by novelist Boris Pasternak. The malevolence afoot in the state of Denmark is magnificently captured by the foreboding black and white cinematography and the dark, dramatic score by composer Dmitri Shostakovich. In addition, acclaimed Russian actors Innokenti Smoktunovsky and Anastasia Vertinskaya offer stellar, award-winning performances. Kozintsev, a peer of Eisenstein&#x92;s who worked well into the 1960s, was a master of cinematic technique who finally achieved recognition at the end of his career for his stunning interpretations of Shakespeare. Leading film historian Richard Dyer wrote in the Boston Globe: \"Paradoxically, the two most powerful films of Shakespeare plays [HAMLET and KING LEAR] were made not in Great Britain but in the Soviet Union.\"", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000K2Q7H8", "B00005JLCI", "B0088XQDD4", "B004SIP83Y", "0780021312", "B0038RSJ0U", "B00J379KKW", "B000HWZ4AC", "B00DQN6IOK", "B00019072G", "B004Q8D1FS", "B00443FMKM", "B000777I88", "B008H6GHE2", "B00AZFECHW", "B000LTTOOS", "B002ZG4Q5W", "B00829WJ5K", "B001LPWGHS", "B00F98FOI6", "B008D1A18E", "B00005M2C7", "B00063MCJI", "B000ALAT64", "B003KGBIRA", "B002E01MBA", "B00BOTCJXC", "B000QGE8IS", "B00AJER4EM", "B005COLEOA", "B004Q87DBQ", "B000G1ALGG", "B00161HSES"], "bought_together": ["B000K2Q7H8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000S1MM66", "B0088XQDD4", "B0038RSJ0U", "B000K2Q7H8"]}, "price": 24.28, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 202223}, "asin": "B000HEWENA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511KE8NXXPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Grigori Kozintsev's Hamlet"}
{"description": "Lo and behold,Clerks IIdefies the odds as a sequel that even the most ardentClerksfans can be happy about. Twelve years after Kevin Smith turned the independent film world upside-down with his $27,000 black-and-white comedy, perpetual slackers Dante (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson) return for another raucous romp in suburbia, but this time there's no beloved Quick Stop mini-mart to ensure their low-level employment. Now they're aimless 33-year-olds flippin' burgers at Mooby's, a fast-food joint with a cow theme that's \"udderly delicious.\" Dante's engaged to his long-time girlfriend but has unexpectedly fallen in love with Mooby's manager Becky (and since she's played by Rosario Dawson, can you blame him?), and Randal's still holding out for life, liberty, and the pursuit of low ambition. The responsibilities of adulthood are rearing their ugly head, and with Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith) still dealing weed and generally being obnoxious, well... something's gotta give, right? The way Smith has written this long-awaited follow-up, the dilemmas of Dante, Randal, and their ongoing friendship are something that anyone can relate to, and with Dawson lighting up the screen (in a role demanded by producer Harvey Weinstein to boost box-office appeal), the movie's romantic chemistry is surprisingly delightful. Rest assured, also, that Smith (shooting mostly in color this time, on a $5 million budget) hasn't forgotten where he came from:Clerks IIis jam-packed with the same lewd, crude humor that madeClerksan indie-film phenomenon, and Smith's good-natured sincerity is still on full display, ensuring that only the most prudish viewers could possibly be offended.

{"description": "Sweet baby Jesus, we thank you for blessing Will Ferrell and Adam McKay with the talent to create a NASCAR comedy as hilarious asTalladega Nights. The so-called \"Ballad of Ricky Bobby\" is hardly flawless  in fact it's not always firing on all cylinders  but with comedy star Ferrell and director McKay still hot from the success of their previous comedy hitAnchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, most of this 108-minute spoof of oval-track racing is so knee-slappin' funny that you can't help but surrender to the stupidity.Obviously, Ferrell's the shining star, and his portrayal of lead-footed pit-crew-member-turned-#1 NASCAR champion Ricky \"I Wanna Go Fast\" Bobby (how can you not love that name?) is spot-on perfect, righteously spoofing the entirety of NASCAR culture without insulting its oft-ridiculed roots in redneck bootlegging of a bygone era. You could even argue that Talladega Nights is truer to NASCAR than Tom Cruise'sDays of Thunder, and it's certainly more entertaining, especially when you add John C. Reilly as Ricky's life-long pal, teammate, and eventual rival Cal Naughton, Jr. (together they're nicknamed \"Shake 'n Bake\"), and Sacha Baron Cohen (fromDa Ali G ShowandBorat) as gay French \"Formula Un\" driver-turned NASCAR rival Jean Girrard, to a stellar cast including Molly Shannon, Greg Germann, Amy Adams and Michael Clarke Duncan.Sure, it's mostly a showcase for Ferrell's loud, over-the-top antics and nonsensical non sequiturs (like cameo appearances by Elvis Costello and Mos Def), but with Ferrell behind the wheel,Talladega Nightsrolls into victory lane with fuel to spare, and there's one final bit of comedy (with a tip of the hat to William Faulkner) for those who sit through the credits. --Jeff ShannonStills fromTalladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby(click for larger image)More NASCAR andTalladega Nightsat Amazon.comThe CalendarOn blu-rayNASCAR on PSPOur NASCAR StoreNASCAR The Imax ExperienceSpeed, Guts, and GloryBookOther Will Ferrell FilmsAnchor ManElfThe Best of Will FerrellMore Films by Will Ferrell", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000WZEZFY", "B001G5T6H6", "B000HRMCTI", "B0007TS24U", "B0009K7RT8", "B00096S49O", "B000EJ9VDY", "B000KF0GSQ", "B000OVLBFI", "B000AM8RQM", "B000SH3XCM", "B00000G02A", "B001F76PDI", "B000ELL1P8", "B000A6QMQA", "B002EQFXZA", "B000L2125O", "B0009Z3LGQ", "B000ASBKHE", "B0009NSDCK", "B000FIS7HK", "B0007TFLLM", "B0012IWO08", "B002SD94AY", "B003L51GW2", "B0007V46JI", "B000ASDFGS", "B000IFRT5G", "B0008JFMEW", "B000GPVUMG", "B000AQ6904", "B002BSC57U", "B0009VCSXW", "B0008JFMF6", "B000R3BN4M", "B007M6W36Y", "B000BYRCHE", "B0009RCPV6", "B000E1YW04", "B002I0GZBI", "B0009X7BFA", "B000B5IP6U", "B0009KQOME", "B000A0GP5Y", "B000ENUYFE", "B0050JN84Q", "B000BGZRTC", "B003DS4Z6Q", "B001KMRN0M", "B000G8O0MU", "B000EWBKU8", "B0047ERZ7Q", "B000KKRD2S", "B00168PFFK", "B00311G2DY", "B00083G5CG", "B002BS47WG", "B0007Z2556", "B0009FU10U", "B000B8IA4E", "B0045SE9XC", "B000AAJTM0", "B0019C6KAC", "B000F2DE8S", "B0011VPYIK", "B0009350CQ", "B0009NJFPY", "B000ADWD2A", "B000FYZS6M", "B000VIUNZI", "B000AQ690Y", "B0009WPZPY", "B003ALEWKU", "B000F4PDEO", "B000A7Q1XI", "B000803BQM", "B0009K7RTI", "B000MNP2KS", "B000NIBUQW", "B000BKJ76C", "B0013KPSDA", "B007ZH9OFI", "B000059TMB", "B002TPTDFC", "B000A3XYE6", "B00151QYU8", "B000F5GJO6", "B0009VRHME", "B0009W5JAA", "B0009RCPXE", "B000BW7QV8", "B0009NSE42", "B001IZNIVE", "B000BYRCRO", "B000B5IOVQ", "B000B5IOW0", "B00083FZH2"], "bought_together": ["B000WZEZFY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001G5T6GW", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00B65JMEI", "B00AEFXJS6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 199481}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.5, "brand": "Son", "asin": "B000J3OTO6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MwbfwtGuL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Talladega Nights - The Ballad of Ricky Bobby [UMD for PSP]"}

{"description": "Much was written about Will Ferrell's first \"dramatic role\" as Harold Crick, an IRS auditor who begins hearing a voice narrating his life. ButStranger Than Fictionis hardly a drama. However, what Ferrell does--like Jim Carrey before him inThe Truman Show--is handle a toned-down character with genuineness and affection: you believe he is this guy. Crick leads a lonely life filled with numbers and routines. While at first he considers the voice a nuisance, Crick decides more action is needed when it speaks of \"his demise.\" Enter Professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), who takes on the absurd notion with revelry, trying to find out what kind of book Crick's life is leading. It turns out that the voice Crick is hearing belongs to Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson), a very real--and troubled--author who is writing a book in which Crick is a fictional character. As usual with these things, the stuffed shirt learns to live a better life--Crick even falls for one of his audits, a brash baker named Ana (Maggie Gyllenhaal). Marc Foster (Monster's Ball, Finding Neverland) has the right tone for the film, using great urban scenes (the unnamed city is Chicago) with interesting visualizations of Crick's world of numbers. He also directs Ferrell, Hoffman, and Gyllenhaal to their most charming performances (plus Linda Hunt and Tom Hulce pop up in two funny scenes). Ferrell succeeds in being a romantic lead you can root for; a scene where he eats Ana's freshly baked cookies is totally delightful without a hint of sarcasm. Screenwriter Zach Helm has two personal traits with his story: like Crick he followed his heart (he stopped rewriting scripts and only worked on his own) and like Eiffel, the final results are not a masterpiece, but good, and entertaining enough.

{"description": "Thematically ambitious and emotionally complex, Clint Eastwood'sFlags of Our Fathersis an intimate epic with much to say about war and the nature of heroism in America. Based on thenon-fiction bestsellerby James Bradley (with Ron Powers), and adapted byMillion Dollar Babyscreenwriter Paul Haggis (Jarheadscreenwriter William Broyles Jr. wrote an earlier draft that was abandoned when Eastwood signed on to direct), this isn't so much a conventional war movie as it is a thought-provoking meditation on our collective need for heroes, even at the expense of those we deem heroic. In telling the story of the six men (five Marines, one Navy medic) who raised the American flag of victory on the battle-ravaged Japanese island of Iwo Jima on February 23rd, 1945, Eastwood takes us deep into the horror of war (in painstakingly authentic Iwo Jima battle scenes) while emphasizing how three of the surviving flag-raisers (played by Adam Beach, Ryan Phillippe, and Jesse Bradford) became reluctant celebrities &#x96; and resentful pawns in a wartime publicity campaign &#x96; after their flag-raising was immortalized by Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal in the most famous photograph in military history.As the surviving flag-raisers reluctantly play their public roles as \"the heroes of Iwo Jima\" during an exhausting (but clearly necessary) wartime bond rally tour,Flags of Our Fathersevolves into a pointed study of battlefield valor and misplaced idolatry, incorporating subtle comment on the bogus nature of celebrity, the trauma of battle, and the true meaning of heroism in wartime. Wisely avoiding any direct parallels to contemporary history, Eastwood allows us to draw our own conclusions about the Iwo Jima flag-raisers and how their postwar histories (both noble and tragic) simultaneously illustrate the hazards of exploited celebrity and society's genuine need for admirable role models during times of national crisis.Flags of Our Fathersdefies the expectations of those seeking a more straightforward war-action drama, but it's richly satisfying, impeccably crafted film that manages to be genuinely patriotic (in celebrating the camaraderie of soldiers in battle) while dramatizing the ultimate futility of war. Eastwood's follow-up film,Letters from Iwo Jima, examines the Iwo Jima conflict from the Japanese perspective.--Jeff ShannonBeyondFlags of Our FathersOther World War II DVDsEssential DVDs by Director Clint EastwoodFlags of Our Fathersby James BradleyStills fromFlags of Our Fathers(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JPKE", "B00555ZTRY", "B000SK5Z2A", "B00AEBBA36", "B000AAF27G", "B001DSNEJM", "B00D3LA63Y", "B001IBIHQ4", "B00AEBB8QK", "B00001ZWUS", "B000F5WR4W", "B00AEBB9UU", "B00004X13T", "B00005JK8K", "B00005PJ8T", "B00C2R11Y8", "B0021L8V2A", "B004U7MQWY", "B0002WT4OE", "B000009RBL", "B00979KQD6", "B00HF98SHG", "B0015D20FE", "B000F4PDF8", "B004SIP9X8", "B00006CXSS", "B00003CXTG", "B004GJYRA0", "B003AT9D74", "0553384155", "B0071HPP3M", "B000065U1N", "B00AEFXVCU", "0553111337", "B0002V7ON8", "0792839730", "B000095WW8", "B003ASLJOU", "B001LXIDWM", "B000NTPG7A", "B0002ISG9W", "B000LAZE8C", "B000P0J09C", "B000EHSVS2", "B00005PJ8S", "B00B0U2SFE", "B008XJ0J8I", "B00275EGWY", "B000DZIGDU", "B00K2CHX9C", "B00005JKTP", "0440229200", "B00AEFXRRO", "B00AEBB86U", "B000EHSVSC", "B005LAIGYQ", "B0007TKNM4", "B0007TKNGA", "B00004XPPG", "B003ASLJO0", "B00003CXHJ", "B001TUZG4K", "B001FB55L2", "B005GYSV4M", "B00AEFXVOI", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AZNEW5G", "B00L4K450G", "B00096S4B2", "B00008K76U", "B003ELKNH2", "B003ASLJMW", "B00005JA9F", "B00004XPPC", "B00BL9MOPS", "B000FJGWBC", "B00HEPE6MM", "0767802470", "B000FVQLRA", "B002T9H2LA", "B00005N5S3", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002O3Z510", "B00005OSJQ", "B005LAIGN2", "B003AWRMA6", "B000P0J0EW", "B002O3Z4WU", "B00J11U54K", "079284646X", "B000ELL1R6", "B007S0DCUU", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B00DL48BM6", "B00096S4BM", "0792841409", "B003ASLJPE", "B0007TKNLA", "0792838408", "B00AEFYENK"], "bought_together": ["B00005JPKE", "B00AEBBA36"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00001ZWUS", "B00006CXSS", "B00005JPKE", "B000P1XITE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 11870}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.88, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B000M4RG42", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51w01CgEgRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Flags of Our Fathers (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Brilliantly conceived, superbly directed, and beautifully acted,Babelis inarguably one of the best films of 2006. Director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and his co-writer, Guillermo Arriaga (the two also collaborated onAmores Perrosand21 Grams) weave together the disparate strands of their story into a finely hewn fabric by focusing on what appear to be several equally incongruent characters: an American (Brad Pitt) touring Morocco with his wife (Cate Blanchett) become the focus of an international incident also involving a hardscrabble Moroccan farmer (Mustapha Rachidi) struggling to keep his two young sons in line and his family together. A San Diego nanny (Adriana Barraza), her employers absent, makes the disastrous decision to take their kids with her to a wedding in Mexico. And a deaf-mute Japanese teen (the extraordinary Rinko Kikuchi) deals with a relationship with her father (Koji Yakusho) and the world in general that's been upended by the death of her mother. It is perhaps not surprising, or particularly original, that a gun is the device that ties these people together. YetBabelisn't merely about violence and its tragic consequences. It's about communication, and especially the lack of it--both intercultural, raising issues like terrorism and immigration, and intracultural, as basic as husbands talking to their wives and parents understanding their children. I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's command of his medium, sound and visual alike, is extraordinary; the camera work is by turns kinetic and restrained, the music always well matched to the scenes, the editing deft but not confusing, and the film (which clocks in at a lengthy 143 minutes) is filled with indelible moments. Many of those moments are also pretty stark and grim, and no will claim that all of this leads to a \"happy\" ending, but there is a sense of reconciliation, perhaps even resolution. \"If You Want to be Understood... Listen,\" goes the tagline. And if you want a movie that will leave you thinking,Babelis it.--Sam GrahamBeyondBabelOther Interweaving Storylines on DVDOther DVDs by Director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rrituWhy We Love Cate BlanchettStills fromBabel(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001CNRRU", "B00005N8A9", "B0041KKYF6", "B000A3XY5A", "B000F7CMRM", "B000067IZ3", "B00005JL57", "B00AEFXESQ", "B001P9KR8U", "B000N6TX1I", "B001JIE7JC", "B00005JPKE", "B00AEFXQ9S", "B00005JMJ4", "B0010DR4BO", "B000NIVJF4", "B000NIVJFY", "B000F1IQN2", "B00HF98SPS", "B0045ZAQRS", "B00011CZRE", "B000N3T0DW", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B000MZHW40", "B004SIP6VI", "B0034G4P30", "B008JFUNKU", "B003ASLJQS", "B000E1NXJ0", "B004SIP6GI", "B00AEBB89W", "B00275EGWY", "B000IONJM4", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00003CWTI", "B00080Z53O", "B00005JNCZ", "B00114XTHA", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00112S8RS", "B001PPLJIQ", "B000MXPE7O", "B00102F5WK", "B00121QGPY", "B0016Q2D66", "B002J1RZHE", "B008220DGE", "B000O76ZQC", "B0013XZ6X4", "B00080ZG10", "B00337KM2S", "B000286RP2", "B004SIP8ZM", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005JMJG", "B00005Q4CS", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B0036TGSJE", "B001TOD92C", "B000OY8NBK", "B004XVMCKS", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B00005JLRE", "B00005JH9M", "B00004WG2F", "B00AEBB8SS", "B00005JKJA", "B00H9HZITU", "B000YENUI6", "B0041KKYDI", "B001MZ5W3M", "B000N3SU92", "B000EQHXNW", "B0041KKYEM", "B001LLH8SE", "B0007TKOAA", "B000P0J0BK", "B002S5N052", "B004SIP7S0", "B00AEBB8NI", "B002SJIO4A", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B000E33VWW", "B000M341QE", "B002VWNICC", "B001NFNFNU", "6305313687", "B00005JKTF", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B00008K7AO", "B00DL48BM6", "079073639X", "B00H83EUQW", "B000FVQLRA", "B0002TT0MI", "B00AHTYI5M", "B00H9L26AA", "B00003CWRX", "B002FHGESI"], "bought_together": ["B00005N8A9", "B0041KKYF6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000A3XY5A", "B0001CNRRU", "B0041KKYF6", "B00G4Q3KOC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 100262}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.22, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B000MCH5P4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51poif023LL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Babel"}
