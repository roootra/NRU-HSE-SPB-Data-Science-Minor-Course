{"description": "If anyone ever doubts whether Nicole Kidman is a good actress, they should immediately be required to watch this outrageously wicked comedy from 1995, for which Kidman deservedly won a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Leading Role. While director Gus Van Sant handles the fact-based satire with razor-sharp precision, Kidman delivers a deliciously devious performance as Suzanne Stone, a small-town New Hampshire housewife who fancies herself the next Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, Diane Sawyer, and Maria Shriver all rolled up into one meticulously coiffed package. So determined is she to have a successful career on TV that she'll stop at nothing--even the calculated murder of her husband (Matt Dillon)--to get the attention she feels entitled to. To carry out her scheme she recruits some unwitting local teenagers including one boy (Joaquin Phoenix, matching Kidman's excellence) whose infatuation with Suzanne leads to sexual escapades and predictably troublesome consequences. It's a satirical comedy in Van Sant's capable hands, but it's so close to tabloid reality that the film never seems implausible--which only gives it a funnier, more blood-chilling quality of humor. Featuring Illeanna Douglas, George Segal, andSeinfeldalumnus Wayne Knight in memorable supporting roles, this is one of the best comedies of the '90s--especially if you prefer comedies with a decidedly darker edge.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305161933", "B004AE3QYE", "B004P7CMUU", "B006YTGLE0", "B000067J3P", "B00005JNQA", "B0007P0X9G", "B0002DB52M", "B009R8Q8Y8", "6305594333", "B000NO1XG8", "B00006L91I", "B00004Y87P", "B0013D8LKO", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B0001GF2D8", "B004SUDQ0O", "B0002W4UDE", "B009B1EPQ4", "B001RJ1Y62", "B00005QJJB", "B000068QPV", "B00AEFXX9Q", "0767821009", "6305308837", "B0043X1FNQ", "B000HC2LHG", "B00441GYZ6", "B00005JMIJ", "B000E5N684", "B006YTGL3G", "B0001EFUFK", "B00827OWO8", "B0011NVC8Y", "0767812158", "B00HQLZC18", "0792845811", "B00005JKJA", "B00AEFYD2M", "B00AEFY8MM", "B0000542CB", "B00011CZRE", "B00007AJFB", "B0045HCIYA", "B00AEBB8ZG", "B000H5TH1Q", "B005DR64OQ", "B00BSN0VZW", "B004SIP92O", "B004SIP86Q", "B0021L9M2I", "B004SUDQC2", "B000HT38EO", "B00GNZM0D6", "B004SIP6QI", "6305213305", "0780627776", "B00008L3UE", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B0007R4SX6", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00AEBB9LO", "B000BOH904", "B00006472O", "B00AEBB8SS", "B00AEFXBPM", "B00E1HIWXU", "B004O26LAI", "B003AWRM9M", "B008220DGE", "B00003CWN3", "0767815718", "0784011710", "B000U1ZV76", "B000PAAJZ6", "6305428107", "B00005JLHW", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B003LR5BD0", "B00H9HZITU", "6305161895", "B000ASDFGI", "B00H83EUQW", "B0003JANWS", "B004ALIG4W", "B0010KP360", "B0050UEVNM", "B00096S49Y", "B000N3SU92", "B00007AJF8", "B00AEFXESQ", "B000068V9U", "B00AEBBA2W", "B003EYVXTG", "B004SUDQ22", "6304696515", "B00J0IN6Z4", "B00G7QPXUI", "B000JBXXYK", "B0072BNJZ8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["6305594333", "B004AE3QYE", "B006YTGLE0", "B00AEBB8P6"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 126577}, "asin": "076781777X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CH7THFMDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "To Die For"}
{"description": "As \"gigantic monster reptile attacks New York\" movies go, you've got to admit thatGodzilladelivers the goods, although its critical drubbing and box-office disappointment were arguably deserved. It's a shameless, uninspired crowd pleaser that's content to serve up familiar action with the advantage of really fantastic special effects, and if you expect nothing more you'll be one among millions of satisfied customers. There's really no other way to approach it--you just have to accept the fact thatIndependence Daycreators Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin are unapologetic plagiarists, incapable of anything more than mindless spectacle that can play in any cinema in the world without dubbing or subtitles. The whole movie plays out like a series of highlights stolen from previous blockbusters of the 1990s; it's little more than a rehash of theJurassic Parkmovies. The derivative script is so trivial that it's unworthy of comment, apart from a few choice laughs and the casting of Michael Lerner as New York's mayor, whose name is Ebert and who closely resembles a certain well-known movie critic. Perhaps that's a clever hint that this movie's essentially critic-proof. It's stupid but it's fun, and for most audiences that's a fitting definition of mainstream Hollywood entertainment. The widescreen Special Edition DVD includes a wealth of bonus materials--audio commentary by the film's special effects supervisors, a \"making of\" featurette, the Wallflowers' music video \"Heroes,\" a photo gallery, and a variety of features related to this and all the classicGodzillafilms from Japan.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CXLS", "B000P24FAE", "B000VXWK86", "B000H30B2C", "B0000VAGXU", "B00066KWCY", "B00I462X7K", "B00003L9CB", "B0001AVZ9Y", "0767825489", "B00I462Y60", "B0000VAGXK", "B0006SGYLK", "B00I099JZK", "B00I462XF2", "B000MV8AJK", "B0088FS1DC", "B009ERJY6G", "B00IE41A9O", "B00AEFYEU8", "B000BMY2L0", "B00K2CHW48", "B00003L9CE", "B00E8G5HQE", "B0002V7OI8", "B00125WAYQ", "0767802497", "B00JB08O76", "B005VU9LO0", "B00008G8M4", "B000E1BXFG", "B001AR0D40", "B000MV8AJU", "B0087ZG7J8", "B007WETMRY", "B000OCY7IU", "6305320950", "B000OCY7IK", "B00125WAYG", "B0087ZG7NO", "B000EHQTZO", "B0093QC3SY", "B001YYQ9S8", "B00B2M7DKA", "B00005A8XX", "B00I099JO6", "B00I3C1T6G", "B00006FD9K", "B007STBUHI", "B002GHHHL0", "B00008WFU4", "B00005R1O7", "B00AEFXPMG", "0783225547", "B00000G3PA", "B00003CXTA", "B00005O5B5", "B0041N72PI", "B00BG4RKL6", "B000OVLBHG", "B0002IQLH6", "B00IQAUO48", "B00IQAUO5C", "B00005JNTI", "B00005JMXX", "B00008WFU5", "B0088FS27C", "B0002B15WY", "B0087ZG7HK", "B0045HCJ0S", "B0024FAG2G", "B000ASATZ8", "B00260HH3K", "B004XVMCN0", "B000F6IOC0", "B00008G8M5", "0780622650", "B000B7MX6Q", "0783231644", "B0068FZ0O2", "B00IQAUO6Q", "B00IQAUO2A", "B00AEFYSR2", "0790738511", "B008JFUPFI", "B00AEFYXQI", "B000R1A0LG", "B000RXVNDI", "B002HTCOCO", "B000056PMU", "B009MF5BXK", "B005G4TJUC", "B0045HCJ9O", "B0006HBZYC", "B000IJ79UW", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B005VU9LKE", "B00IAO618S", "B000BYY11Y", "B000EHSVPK"], "bought_together": ["B000P24FAE", "B000VXWK86"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CXLS", "B00K2CHW48", "B0034G4ORC", "B00177YA1K"]}, "price": 6.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8109}, "asin": "0767817478", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51xvBMPeK6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Godzilla"}

{"description": "Call it \"Desperate Movie,\" because this ludicrous thriller deteriorates into unintentional comedy. For reasons that are never explained, a sociopathic killer (Michael Keaton) is the only available bone marrow donor for the cancer-stricken son of a San Francisco cop (Andy Garcia), who must capture the killer alive after a laughable escape in a labyrinthine hospital. The ensuing manhunt relies on plentiful plot holes and ridiculous shortcuts (like Keaton's use of a surgical laser to cut leg irons, or accessing hospital schematics from a prison computer). Self-consciously shot in film noir style, the cat-and-mouse routine leads to a briefly impressive car chase, but the premise (which even the movie's original press notes described as \"intriguing, if unlikely\") is based on \"moral ambiguity\" that doesn't translate from script to screen. Instead of forcing Keaton's typically \"sick genius\" to prove his ingenuity, the film pits him against a squad of cops who couldn't find a beer in a crowded pub.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00002E23C", "6305310335", "B00AEFYD9K", "B00008977C", "B00005JNNT", "B00000F5MN", "B000U1ZV76", "0767806808", "B00000IQC9", "B00008NFR3", "0767807588", "B00AEFXKZ8", "6305692572", "B0001932ZK", "B00009AOAZ", "0767810872", "0792844866", "B00007AJE1", "0783226888", "0783219571", "6305213305", "B00096S49Y", "B00029RT9E", "B000F6ZIII", "B00015YVDG", "B00008L3S6", "B000LBL3TK", "B002NZK5RI", "B003L20IG0", "B002KGVB7S", "B000N4RASS", "B004GJYRK0", "B00AEFXIIW", "B00005Y1UV", "B000C3L2PC", "B002AT8K9W", "B001KRVLCI", "B00005UQ9T", "0790736411", "0792833848", "B00JL6L4UY", "B000PISZ7W", "6305162026", "B00005QAOZ", "B0006D3HGA", "B000EU1ONS", "B000087F7R", "B002AT8KAG", "B007WZPQO6", "0783222149", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B000R4SMCW", "B00JDCP0QA", "6305308837", "B003AWRMA6", "B000NTMA0Q", "0790732149", "B003ASLJIQ", "B00004STDN", "B002LK3DZQ", "B000MEYKEG", "0767809726", "B0036TGT8Y", "B000B8GT92", "6304806434", "B00AEBB9NM", "B0045HCJFS", "6304602944", "B00005R5GA", "B004BSWC8A", "B002O3Z4WK", "B0000399WA", "B001R3YRG2", "B00003CXKA", "B00AEFYF2K", "0792844874", "B002ZG98SW", "B004SIP9CO", "B0001FGBWK", "630523650X", "B0045O2PHS", "B000P0J06K", "B001M9ELQC", "B00BGI07GC", "B000I2J736", "B001CW8016", "B00HLTD49C", "B003AWRM9M", "B000CBCWRG", "B000EQ5SRK", "6304765258", "B00008977A", "B001U0HB5Q", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B000F6ZIIS", "0783229402", "B00AEBB8O2", "B00CX7TOOG", "B000055Y0Y"], "bought_together": ["B00002E23C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0783219571", "B000PISZ7W", "B00AEFYD9K", "B0001932ZK"]}, "price": 19.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 134257}, "asin": "0767812743", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519STKWW5QL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Desperate Measures"}

{"description": "This special-edition DVD gives the modern-day viewer a taste of what  movies were like in 1961. Four curious featurettes are included, produced as publicity for the film. James Darren narrates a little ditty at his honeymoon in Malta during filming; Irene Papas narrates a giddy, old-fashioned look at \"Two Girls on the Town.\" There's even a filmed bit with producer-writer Carl Foreman that showed once at the premiere. The 20-minute retrospective made in 1999 has the expected reminiscences from Gregory Peck and Anthony Quinn. Director J.&nbsp;Lee Thompson's audio commentary is a bit frustrating; he's now in his 80s, and most of his recollections are slow in coming.

{"description": "Not only was Barry Levinson's comedy shot in a relatively fast period of 29 days, the satire of politics and show business feels as if it were made yesterday. There's a fresh spin quite evident here, a nervy satire of a presidential crisis and the people who whitewash the facts. The main players are a mysterious Mr. Fix-It (Robert De Niro), veteran Hollywood producer (Dustin Hoffman), and a White House aide (Anne Heche). Can the president's molesting of a young girl be buried in the two weeks before an election? A war in Albania just might do the trick. In the good old days, the president would just invade. With modern technology, it's even cleaner. The hungry press looks for any lead, convenient misinformation is created by the latest Hollywood fakery (\"all developed by the new James Cameron film\") creating images and merchandise all instantly packaged. And it must be real, because it's on TV. David Mamet's script never questions the morals or the absolute secrecy needed to pull this thing off. He and director Barry Levinson have enough truth in the story to make you wonder what is real news and what is just promotion the next time you see CNN. Many of the supporting players impact the story with mere presence: Denis Leary as a quote man, Willie Nelson as a songwriter. The three leads are magnificent.

{"description": "The mind-bending worlds of author H.P. Lovecraft have long interested horror directors, but the films have rarely successfully captured his nightmarish mix of madness and mythology. John Carpenter'sIn the Mouth of Madnessis not directly based on Lovecraft's work, but screenwriter Michael De Luca draws his inspiration from Lovecraft's Cthulu mythology and then adds his own ingenious twists. John Trent (Sam Neill), an insurance investigator recently fitted for a straightjacket, tells his story to a psychiatrist. Hired to track down the missing pop-horror phenomena Sutter Cane, a Stephen King-like author whose fans are literally made for his books, Trent finds the supposedly fictional Hobb's End.  He watches the town collapse into madness, murder, and monstrous transformations: the fantastic horrors of Cane's novels played out in front of his eyes. \"Reality isn't what it used to be,\" deadpans one zombielike townsperson. In fact, it is how Cane writes it--but is he Devil, dark oracle, or simply a preacher in the service of an evil that grows stronger with every soul his books convert? The script never quite gets a grip on the blurry relationship between fact and fiction, but those details fade in the face of Carpenter's demented imagery, shiver-inducing twists, and dark wit. It's more eerie mind game than straight-out horror, a portrait of a world gone mad, and Carpenter relishes every hallucinatory moment.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000AOX0A", "0792839706", "B000RPCK2O", "B000067J0M", "B0085X315U", "B003V6XDP4", "B00AEFXW8I", "B000AM6OQ2", "B00005K3OC", "B0002CHK1S", "B000BQTC98", "B00B8O4WQA", "B0024FADBA", "B005OT810I", "B008CYDD7I", "B003TRMLQM", "B0000AOX0F", "B00008974J", "B00006AUIG", "0783116926", "B00KH57THK", "B0000DC12T", "B0009298N4", "B000MV8ABS", "B006LMRMMA", "B0053TWW9K", "6304936532", "B00009YXHN", "B00JQYV0B4", "B004EI2NPO", "B001B8XRT6", "B008874968", "B0000AOX09", "B00AGKH4MG", "B00009WNXA", "B00FYV7WCY", "B0000AOX0E", "B00009PY2T", "B002I41KNC", "B00J0IN6Z4", "B00FXOO1VC", "B002HML6YI", "B0024FAG44", "B000TZJCMS", "B0009X75J2", "157362408X", "B00004Y87O", "B000MV8AC2", "B000RPCJA2", "B000S0GYRU", "B002GHHHG0", "0783228457", "B008WAM2E2", "B00DOZNGTK", "B00D7AM6M0", "B000HEWEGC", "B00BTYPW7C", "B00005O439", "B000F3UA8E", "B00005KH30", "B001AGNMFI", "B00009OWI1", "6305258287", "B0053TWW36", "B0001ZX0GK", "B0002S9QUA", "B00IA1VKVY", "B0001XAKUQ", "B009EUVXZI", "0792841328", "B0002C9DK4", "B004EI2NP4", "B000QUCQX8", "B00005NRN6", "B00009MEC4", "B00003CY6P", "B001D5C1OO", "B000MV8ZCW", "B00006CXGP", "B006QWC2ZC", "B00G5GNYY2", "B0067QPVJ6", "B0001LQJMQ", "B000IJ7A5Q", "8598310042", "B00J81S92S", "B00023P4TM", "B000WC389G", "0790742829", "B000TUDBFC", "B0007WQHI0", "B00EZ50SGW", "B001J710Y8", "B0001611DI", "B002LMSWN2", "B00DBPBOZG", "B0014VPFVS", "B0053TWVIM", "B000MDFTHE"], "bought_together": ["B0000AOX0A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000AOX0A", "B0000AOX0F", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B000AM6OQ2"]}, "price": 27.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 56503}, "asin": "078062856X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/411R7MSBQ1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "In the Mouth of Madness"}

{"description": "In one of those plot devices so dear to writers of romantic comedy (in this case, the venerable Norman Krasna, ofWife vs. SecretaryandMr. and Mrs. Smith), financier Charles Coburn goes undercover as a shoe salesman in a Manhattan department store that's a tiny part of his portfolio, hoping to discover why the employees hate him so much. He has the luck to be assigned to the counter next to Jean Arthur, rasping out one of her inimitable hard-nosed working-girl-with-a-heart-of-gold performances, who befriends Coburn and introduces him to her boyfriend (Robert Cummings)--the leader of the labor unrest. Directed by the stodgy Sam Wood (King's Row), the film flirts with '30s radicalism but settles for prudent class reconciliation: turns out that all the employees want is a little bit of gratitude and respect. Coburn got his first Academy Award nomination for his gruff but ultimately lovable coot (and won the Oscar two years later, opposite Arthur inThe More the Merrier), a part he was to play for much of the rest of his career. Some startling deep-focus effects suggest that cinematographer Harry Stradling may have been spying onCitizen Kane, shooting just down the hall at RKO. Ultimately, though, it's Arthur who gives the film its authenticity and tremulous charm.--Dave Kehr", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002HOEPS", "B0024FAG1C", "6302224357", "B000083C6R", "B00006G8EZ", "B00003L9CI", "B003ZW9H68", "B0024FAG1M", "B000E6ESWG", "B002IC1EUI", "B007HRKBM6", "6301640667", "B004P8R9F2", "B00070HK2O", "B0048NVPD6", "6302241103", "B0001ZMXC2", "6302120535", "0792845846", "B00029HOSU", "6302786924", "B0014127V4", "0783217471", "B008Y1YJO0", "6301977254", "B004R6EF9A", "6302728363"], "also_viewed": ["B00I17WJV2", "B0098NWO4U"]}, "price": 8.2, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 370465}, "asin": "0782008445", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/711SY9X0K4L._SY300_.gif", "title": "The Devil and Miss Jones [VHS]"}

But can they trap him before he kills again?", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000CR7R7U", "B0007NFLO0", "B0042DN4U4", "B00004ZBVK", "0679422765", "B000M9BPF8", "B000A2X4CO", "B000A2X3QG", "B001RPZE26", "B000RW5BYG", "B0079ZWUN4", "B003NLE5L8", "B00347AIOO", "B000A2X3MU", "0060177179", "0942637909", "B0039A9M7K", "B00AEBB89W", "B00005AQMJ", "0804111642", "B0049TC8GW", "B001BEK8CO", "B00005B6OY", "B0001AVZM6", "B00JPQ1I7O", "B0002YLD46", "B00005YUO1", "B0002IQLB2", "B001PYD0PC", "B00K1L4NBU", "B007UW9W5U", "B000M9BPFS", "B002GLG5OQ", "B002NZK5RI", "B000BYA5H8", "B003EJO8IY", "B00DZP1C2W", "B00KHA99BY", "B00003CXP7", "B00JPUUSEE", "B00GKP70L6", "B002U1LGUK", "B000A2XAPU", "B00JHH1VSW", "B002XUBDVA", "B00005U2KC", "B003T6LHWC", "B00005B8U4", "B000TLTCQI", "B008NNY8XQ", "B00D49YFAA", "B001HVZO7A", "B00441GZ00", "B002E2QH7W", "B00005K3NV", "B0051QS1P4", "B00DDY45DI", "B004OB2EYQ", "B00006JDU8", "B001KKU9CI", "B00AEFYD9K", "B006ZGROB6", "B0029Z8K74", "B000EHQU0S", "B00HT2RTU6", "B000NY0YJU", "B00G575PD4", "B00004XPPE", "B00E3H3CO2", "B000TZJCMS", "B00003CWU3", "B000784WYU", "B00GNZM03G", "B00002E22E", "B00006AUJR", "B000LP6KNU", "B00441GYYC", "B008I1G6Y2", "B000FAOC2W", "B00H7BJ0C4", "B000EWBNUU", "B000M341SC", "067101448X", "B000P0J0D8", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B0095ZIHZ6", "B008RO6PJQ", "B00BEIYMAG", "0783226853", "B001SMC9L2", "B000P0J0AG", "B00021R7CG", "B000KP62FM", "B001R10BIC", "B00GICP84W", "B000MNOXX0", "B005IQGNHK", "6305428522", "B000A6T1ZO", "6304936532"], "bought_together": ["B000CR7R7U", "B0007NFLO0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0679422765", "B000A2X3QG", "B000CR7R7U", "B0007NFLO0"]}, "price": 5.22, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 34799}, "asin": "0783116934", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513MwSkzLnL._SX300_.jpg", "title": "Citizen X"}

{"description": "In the vastly overrated 1998 bookEasy Riders, Raging Bulls, author Peter Biskind puts the blame for Hollywood's blockbuster mentality at least partially on Steven Spielberg's box-office success with this adaptation of Peter Benchley's bestselling novel. But you can't blame Spielberg for making a terrific movie, whichJawsdefinitely is. The story of a Long Island town whose summer tourist business is suddenly threatened by great-white-shark attacks on humans bypasses the potboiler trappings of Benchley's book and goes straight for the jugular with beautifully crafted, crowd-pleasing sequences of action and suspense supported by a trio of terrific performances by Roy Scheider (as the local sheriff), Richard Dreyfuss (as a shark specialist), and particularly Robert Shaw (as the old fisherman who offers to hunt the shark down). The sequences on Shaw's boat--as the three of them realize that in fact the shark is huntingthem--are what entertaining moviemaking is all about.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005B6ND", "6300183181", "0784011923", "0767825411", "6305814694", "B00000JGEI", "6303148352", "6303506291", "630018403X", "B00000490M", "6300214753", "6304932553", "630442972X", "6300269639", "B0000048S1", "B000005PFL", "6302765536", "6302091632", "6302824729", "6303344224", "6301570723", "6300247171", "B00008WFU5", "6305576173", "6300183467", "0790743213", "6304143184", "6303402348", "1558808221", "6303020089", "B000063UUL", "B00005B238", "6303212379", "B00005A8XX", "0790731436", "0783226152", "0790705141", "6300267881", "B00008WFU4", "6300181340", "630157401X", "6302921058", "6300214060", "6302968143", "1558802258", "0792102320", "6300214087", "6300268993", "B0000BWVBD", "B002GHHHL0", "6301888901", "B00005JKDQ", "6303122647", "6302800420", "6303610811", "6301827732", "6303540082", "6302374189", "0800198395", "6300214435", "6304071876", "6301208773", "B00000IO4G", "B00006G8LB", "B0087ZG7HK", "B00008DZ83", "6300214710", "6300215814", "630220366X", "6304457324", "0800116917", "B000059XY5", "6303212263", "6300216500", "6303236863", "630533577X", "6300213986", "6302415853", "6304935811", "6302820448", "B00004U8P4", "6300214311", "6301798503", "0793927501", "6300214370", "6302787564", "6304288433", "6300182878", "B000003KHS", "6301971809", "B000007OY0", "0790734079", "630336568X", "0790733927", "0790742322", "6301966988", "0764006770", "B000059XVO", "B00023BLXA"], "also_viewed": ["B00008WFU5", "6301792734", "6305814694", "B00005B6ND", "0784011923", "0767825411", "6300214060", "6300183181", "6300247171", "B00005A8XX", "6303506291", "B00006AL1C", "0792151712", "6304539258", "630018403X", "6305363668", "B00008WFU4", "B00000JGEI", "B00078XGO2", "6304117752", "6301574117", "0800116917", "B000005PPB", "B0056BE0SG", "6302091632", "080010367X", "6304143184", "6300216845", "6304539274", "6303148352", "0792158261", "B00000JS61", "0792839846", "6303212379", "0792837614", "0783222955", "0783221347", "0790700506", "6302921058", "6301797906", "6301976983", "6305123616", "6303402070", "6304429274", "1558807780", "B00005JKDQ", "6300214370", "6302936381", "B00000JGEK", "B0000AQZYM", "B00000JXVM", "B0007KTBIU", "0790734079", "6304039522", "6300214753", "B00005NCCP", "B005FHWWXQ", "B0087F7VSY", "B00KDU8HQQ"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 177995}, "asin": "0783216084", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514JQY1K3TL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jaws [VHS]"}

{"description": "On her first day of work, Sue Applegate (Ginger Rogers) has to escape the clutches of a lecherous client (Robert Benchley, whose favorite line is \"Why don't you slip out of that wet coat and into a dry martini?\"). Fed up with the big city, Sue decides to head home to Iowa with the precious $27.50&nbsp;train fare she's kept in a sealed envelope since her arrival. The fare has gone up, however, and she is forced to pose as a 12-year-old to buy a half-price ticket. On the train, she has to dodge the suspicious conductors and bursts into the compartment of Major Phillip Kirby (Ray Milland), who falls for Sue's masquerade and harbors her for the night. The situation is further complicated by the major's fianc&eacute;e (Rita Johnson) and her savvy 12-year-old sister (Diana Lynn), the only one who sees through the ruse. Add a stay at the major's academy and some escapades with young, hormone-driven cadets, and you have an enjoyable, if not quite classic, silly comedy, well paced by Billy Wilder in his first directorial effort. Rogers's real-life mother appears in a small role as Sue's mother. Rogers is only occasionally convincing as a 12-year-old, but after all she was 30 at the time.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000JKNL", "0783228074", "6302453127", "6304383193"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 264760}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 35.0, "brand": "", "asin": "078321894X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51V5EH6KC8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Major and the Minor [VHS]"}
{"description": "A remarkably ambitious and engrossing project, this 1978 television  miniseries ran 26-and-a-half hours, cost a then-enormous $25 million, and involved 4 directors, 5 cinematographers, and somewhere in the neighborhood of 100 speaking parts. Based on James Michener's panoramic bestseller about the settling of the American West--as reflected in the history of a fictional  town called Centennial, Colorado--the story begins in the late 18th century and ends with a typical 20th century conflict over land usage.Centennial, however, largely concentrates on various memorable  frontiersmen, trappers, Indians, ranchers, cowboys, and farmers from long  ago. Richard Chamberlain shines as the pioneer Alexander McKeag, Robert  Conrad does some of his best work as French-Canadian Pasquinel, and  performances by Alex Karras, Chad Everett, Sally Kellerman, Raymond Burr,  Richard Crenna, David Janssen, and Dennis Weaver effectively add to a  tapestry of adventure, tragedy, violence, and dubious Western progress.  Produced at a time when TV networks were in the throes of acknowledging  America's history of racial injustice, the program paints a starkly  villainous portrait of opportunists exploiting and destroying Indians in the name of manifest destiny. While the project's great length might make one  wary of diving in,Centennialis the sort of carefully paced drama  that makes one care about the intertwined destinies of unique characters and how they illuminate America's past.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004WMLU", "6302150620", "6302787513", "6302571251", "B00BAXTY7G", "0792110803", "6300218171", "6303536859", "6301810678"], "bought_together": ["6302150620"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 240471}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 34.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0783215126", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71QQR6T1S4L._SX300_.jpg", "title": "Centennial Vols 1-12 [VHS]"}
{"description": "Steven Spielberg's 1993 mega-hit rivalsJawsas the most intense and frightening film he'd ever made prior toSchindler's List, but it was also among his weakest stories. Based on Michael Crichton's novel about an island amusement park populated by cloned dinosaurs, the film works best as a thrill ride with none of the interesting human dynamics of Spielberg'sJaws. That lapse proves unfortunate, but there's no shortage of raw terror as a rampaging T-rex and nasty raptors try to make fast food out of the cast. The effects are still astonishing (despite the fact that the computer-generated technology has since been improved upon) and at times primeval, such as the sight of a herd of whatever-they-are scampering through a valley.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004U8P4", "B00003CXXR", "6303314015", "6301792734", "6304143184", "0783216084", "0767825411", "6304089767", "6303506291", "B00005JKDQ", "6300214060", "6301208773", "6301888901", "6302091632", "6304233639", "6302054982", "0788805533", "B00000JGEI", "6301666569", "6302453356", "6305319138", "B0000AQZYM", "6302787068", "6301744136", "B000059XXZ", "B000059XY5", "B000005QWI", "0784011923", "6304500831", "6303020089", "B000003KSM", "6302968143", "6302415853", "6300214435", "B00000490M", "6301744160", "630157401X", "6302877881", "6304007523", "6300181987", "6301661729", "6304030959", "0800198395", "0783226152", "B000062XM6", "B00005B238", "6303212263", "630596260X", "B000005PPB", "B0000048S1", "6303824382", "B000007OY0", "B000005PFL", "6300248089", "B00004RFFA", "6300213005", "6305045976", "080010367X", "6304022166", "B00006G8LB", "0790700506", "0790719029", "B00005B6ND", "0790742322", "6304196954"], "bought_together": ["B00004U8P4", "B00003CXXR"], "also_viewed": ["B00004U8P4", "B00003CXXR", "6304143184", "6301792734", "6305750750", "6304089767", "6303506291", "B0087ZG7NO", "B00005LL26", "6300214753", "6304539258", "0788806270", "0784011923", "B00005JLGL", "B0057R5XRG", "B000065U6Q", "6304400551", "0767825411", "0788805533", "6304500831", "B0002XNSYA", "6302787068", "B00000K2SC", "0780607287", "155890641X", "6304539274", "6302091632", "B00000JS61", "B0000AQZYM", "0792839129", "B00004U8KV", "B00005JKDQ", "6303313345", "0788812807", "6302526574", "6300213803", "630018403X", "6302426200", "B00005MP5C", "B000035Z2S", "080010367X", "B00023NRSM", "6301543408", "0790705141", "6304015127", "B00004R99N", "6303212379", "0783216084", "6302320402", "6304718551", "B0087ZG7J8", "B00000JGEI", "6303953425", "B005N64U52", "6303929567", "6303314015", "6302453356"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 481629}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.68, "brand": "", "asin": "0783222734", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MNFQR1V1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}
{"description": "The second film in Oliver Stone's Vietnam trilogy moves from the brutality of war inPlatoonto its equally traumatic aftermath. Based on the memoir of combat veteran Ron Kovic, the film stars Tom Cruise as Kovic, whose gunshot wound in Vietnam left him paralyzed from the chest down. He is deeply embittered by neglect in a veteran's hospital and by the shattering of his patriotic idealism because of the horror and futility of the Vietnam conflict. While painfully and awkwardly adjusting to his disability and a changing definition of masculinity, Kovic joins the burgeoning movement of antiwar protest, culminating in a climactic appearance at the 1976 Democratic national convention. A powerfully intimate portrait that unfolds on an epic scale,Born on the Fourth of Julyis arguably Stone's best film (if you can forgive its often strident tone), and Cruise's Oscar-nominated role is uncompromising in its depiction of one man's personal anguish and political awakening.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["079284646X", "B006TTC5HC", "B0015D20FE", "B000ELL1R6", "B000B8QG22", "B000P0J09C", "B00031V21M", "B00005V9HI", "B003ELKNH2", "B004FQX59I", "B00AEBBA36", "B00AEFXR1K", "B000GAKDAG", "B00000IQC0", "B00005JN2Z", "B0018QPPXW", "B00AEBB86U", "B000065V3G", "B000035Z5G", "1888451785", "B00005PJ8T", "B00001ZWUS", "B00005B6JZ", "B0013FCWUW", "B0000YEEGM", "B000M4RG42", "B000RTB0R6", "B00AEFY0F2", "B004U7MR1Y", "0800141741", "0783226810", "B00AEBB9LO", "B000E1NXJ0", "B00005JA9F", "B00275EGWY", "B003ASLJOU", "B001TUZG4K", "B00005JNTI", "B002OGMGV4", "B000CEXEWA", "0767830555", "B0002WZTOI", "B000EHSVS2", "B00AEFXYJA", "B00B0U2SFE", "B00004RF82", "B00080ZG10", "B00005JK8K", "B004FQX5B6", "B000059TFO", "B000065U1N", "B00008G8M4", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B0000542CI", "B000O599YO", "B000G6BLHY", "B003BV8I3Q", "B00005J760", "0800141806", "B004SIP7ZS", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B00005N5S2", "B0006GAOJA", "B000P0J09M", "B001MVWFAO", "B00AEBB95K", "B000C20VPA", "B0043X1FL8", "B000U788WU", "0767817745", "B003ASLJQI", "B004SIP7TE", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B000BRP4BM", "B000FVQLQQ", "B000CNESTE", "B00005JPKE", "B0004Z33EG", "B00000K0DQ", "B000GG4Y32", "B00005JL78", "B000059HAN", "6305428522", "B004AOECXI", "B000PAAJZ6", "B001TH92N4", "B000ZM1MGE", "B00BTYJYR6", "0783225733", "B0006GANN2", "0767836359", "B00008CMRK", "B004GJYRI2", "B003HKN52U", "0800177967", "B000FVQLRA", "B00011CZRE", "B00009W5CA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["079284646X", "B00001ZWUS", "B006TTC5HC", "B000B8QG22"]}, "price": 8.48, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 263904}, "asin": "0783226764", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510WBGNCT9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Born on the Fourth of July"}
{"description": "After a career slump that plagued him through most of the 1980s, Al Pacino made a stellar comeback in this taut 1989 thriller, playing a weary New York police detective who falls in love with the woman (Ellen Barkin) who is the prime suspect in the murder case he's investigating. Expertly written by Richard Price and directed by Harold Becker, the story is designed to keep its central characters (and the viewer) in a state of constant suspicion and arousal--an emotional combination that sends dangerous sparks flying between Pacino and Barkin. Their chemistry is intense, and their love scenes are some of the hottest of any movie of its decade. ButSea of Loveis not merely concerned with cheap titillation. It's a riveting whodunit with scenes of nail-biting suspense and memorable dialogue that make it as interesting to listen to as it is to watch. Barkin had made a similarly sexy impression inThe Big Easy, and here she gives one of the best performances of her underrated career, matching Pacino's excellence scene for scene. The ending's a bit of a letdown because the murder solution comes somewhat out of the blue, but it's the acting and suspense that you'll remember most--qualities that makeSea of Loveone of the best films of its kind.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305262268", "B0043X1FNQ", "B00BTYRB3U", "B000HC2LHG", "B00008L3S6", "B00441GYPG", "0783226845", "B00AEBB95K", "B00000K3TU", "B00013RC66", "6305308837", "6305310335", "B0000AM6JI", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B0045HCJIK", "B0043X1FKY", "B003LR5BD0", "B004SUDQ1S", "6305065551", "B000E5N684", "B00000JGHL", "B000A9QK6E", "B000CNESTE", "B00004XPPB", "0790730979", "B000CBCWRG", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005K3NU", "B00AEFYD9K", "B00005JLX2", "0792844874", "B00127RAGC", "B002AS463W", "B0015OKWL2", "B002AT8KAG", "B0002T7YQW", "B000C20VRS", "6305213305", "079073219X", "B0009GX1CO", "B00AEFYC96", "B000H5TH1Q", "B0045HCJ8K", "B00009Y3PV", "B00441GYOM", "B00000J11D", "B000LP6KMQ", "0767810872", "B00005U2KC", "B00009WVSL", "B000EQ5SRK", "B00AEFYD2M", "B004YCKKFK", "B00015YVDG", "B00AEFXN9G", "B00003CWRX", "B00BLF9FYA", "B00AEBB9N2", "B00005JO5L", "B00005K3NV", "B000069HZP", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00AEFXIIW", "B00AEBB9EG", "6305428484", "B001NY4WYC", "B000059TGB", "B00006RCNY", "B002VWNICC", "B00AEFXG2U", "B00006L91I", "B006GVN05O", "B000087F6M", "B000UGBOT0", "B00AEFXKZ8", "B003AWRMA6", "B001TK80D4", "B002NZK5RI", "076782170X", "B000A9QK5K", "B00005OLYF", "0767817729", "B004499LX0", "B0001US62I", "B000GNOSDG", "B0006GANN2", "B00005JLJW", "B00005JMIJ", "B00AEFXBPM", "B0006HBZBK", "B00AEFYW64", "B00007G1YQ", "B0001FGBW0", "B000FO0AA6", "B003INBNOS", "0767802616", "B000A2UBN4"], "bought_together": ["6305262268", "B000HC2LHG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00C7MW53E", "6305262268", "B000HC2LHG", "0783226845"]}, "price": 33.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 231594}, "asin": "0783226918", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G3SG0CZAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sea of Love"}
{"description": "Stanley Kubrick was only 31 years old when Kirk Douglas (star of Kubrick's classicPaths of Glory) recruited the young director to pilot this epic saga, in which the rebellious slave Spartacus (played by Douglas) leads a freedom revolt against the decadent Roman Empire. Kubrick would later disown the film because it was not a personal project--he was merely a director-for-hire--butSpartacusremains one of the best of Hollywood's grand historical epics. With an intelligent screenplay by then-blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo (from a novel by Howard Fast), its message of moral integrity and courageous conviction is still quite powerful, and the all-star cast (including Charles Laughton in full toga) is full of entertaining surprises. Fully restored in 1991 to include scenes deleted from the original 1960 release, the full-lengthSpartacusis a grand-scale cinematic marvel, offering some of the most awesome battles ever filmed and a central performance by Douglas that's as sensitively emotional as it is intensely heroic. Jean Simmons plays the slave woman who becomes Spartacus's wife, and Peter Ustinov steals the show with his frequently hilarious, Oscar-winning performance as a slave trader who shamelessly curries favor with his Roman superiors. The restored version also includes a formerly deleted bathhouse scene in which Laurence Olivier plays a bisexual Roman senator (with restored dialogue dubbed by Anthony Hopkins) who gets hot and bothered over a slave servant played by Tony Curtis. These and other restored scenes expand the film to just over three hours in length. Despite some forgivable lulls, this is a rousing and substantial drama that grabs and holds your attention. Breaking tradition with sophisticated themes and a downbeat (yet eminently noble) conclusion,Spartacusis a thinking person's epic, rising above mere spectacle with a story as impressive as its widescreen action and Oscar-winning sets.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0074JOUHE", "B001DZOCY6", "B00005JN8Z", "B000062XF2", "B000056AXZ", "B001NSLE5I", "B00AMSM9CW", "B00125WAXM", "B00005V1WY", "B00ALTQRUC", "B000WMFZMY", "B00BQ7GU1Y", "0792841409", "B00AEBBACM", "B0006GANX2", "B0001NBMDK", "B00AEFY5B6", "B000BZISSU", "B000UJ48VI", "B000UJ48SQ", "B0002BO05S", "B000CNE0M4", "B00006ADD5", "B0010YSDAE", "B00004XPPC", "B002AT8KBU", "B008FYZI6E", "B0006GANN2", "B000055Y0X", "B004H0M31I", "B0006B2A6U", "0792838408", "B000056HEA", "B004L9GMBC", "B0007TKNGA", "B00005JKU0", "B005152C9G", "B005152C78", "B000EHSVS2", "B000095WW6", "B00AEFXD1O", "B007XTDXF0", "B000KX0IOA", "B000KJU18C", "B0050FXDDQ", "B003D3Y65G", "B00005PJ6T", "B003ZEQMH8", "0792833287", "B0000DI87S", "B0049985XW", "B0010YSD7W", "B00079Z9VO", "B0010AN7Z4", "B002VWNIAY", "B007K8ILTW", "B00AMSLDTM", "B007N31YH0", "B0001US8F8", "B0045HCJSA", "B002O3Z50Q", "B000CNESN0", "B000EHSVSC", "B00007G1WH", "B00AEFXKUI", "0767810864", "B00108FMFO", "B00407PNWO", "B0018O4RT2", "B000G8NXYG", "B000063US2", "B00005JKF6", "B0010YVCI4", "B00001ZWUS", "B000XJD34I", "B0045HCJ9E", "B000P0J09C", "B000C20VRS", "B000S0KYTE", "B007Y1NR1W", "B00007JMD8", "B00871C09S", "B000FZETR0", "B00008PC13", "B000HWZ4C0", "B001LPWGGY", "B003WKL6YO", "B00AEBB89C", "B00005N5S3", "B007FQXEVY", "B00DJYKGKS", "B0047BXQZY", "B0057FGCRI", "B0001NBMEE", "B000MGTQ7U", "B000059TFW", "B00003CXBU", "B002ZD3V10", "B00014K5V4", "B00005J75F"], "bought_together": ["B0074JOUHE", "B001NSLE5I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00001ZWUS", "0792841409", "B00GGAK0FS", "B0016K40KY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18109}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.27, "brand": "DOUGLAS,KIRK", "asin": "0783226039", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FrSKZ6tSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Spartacus"}

Anthony Perkins is unforgettable as Norman Bates, the mama's boy proprietor of the Bates Motel; and so is Janet Leigh as Marion Crane, who makes an impulsive decision and becomes a fugitive from the law, hiding out at Norman's roadside inn for one fateful night.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000Q66Q8I", "B0087ZG7PW", "B00000IQVC", "B00871C09S", "B0087ZG7R0", "B0009X76P0", "B0045HCJ9E", "B002VWNIDG", "B00004TS0G", "B0002HOERG", "1590203356", "B00003CXCF", "B000RIWAVW", "B00DNUSFZQ", "B003UGLCIA", "B0009X76PK", "B008BFSMBA", "B0002HOEQ2", "B0050FXDDQ", "B000V4UFZK", "B000FS9FE4", "B000ECX0O2", "B00AEBB97S", "B004FQX5B6", "B000CCW2U2", "B00009PY4G", "B007STBUHI", "B00005K3NR", "B0009NZ2MO", "B00I9KW95M", "B002VWNIAY", "B000CCW2TS", "B00ARA4SLU", "B000LP6KNU", "B001D2WU9I", "078323502X", "B000A9QK7I", "B00FERST4S", "B0010YVCI4", "B00079Z9WI", "B00AEFYYH6", "B006FE83UE", "B00003CXBU", "B00018D42W", "B000TSIJWY", "B0087ZG7OI", "B007Y1NR1W", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B0009A40ES", "B00AEBB89C", "B007Y1NNAW", "B001NPD9LS", "1593765118", "B002ZG971U", "B000CCW2UW", "B004LWZW2O", "B000ECX0Q0", "B00A1AU72A", "B00009NHC5", "B001D8W7EU", "B00006ADD5", "0767830555", "B0053TWVDC", "B000VKL6Z2", "B006TTC5WC", "B001B1UO6W", "B00001QGUM", "B0000AOX09", "B000AM6OQ2", "B0001CNRRU", "B00000IQC4", "B001D8W7EK", "B00005A06N", "B000IMUYJM", "B000055Y0X", "B00005LC4Q", "B00001U0BN", "B003ZYU3U0", "B00AEFY37C", "B001JV5BIA", "B00079Z9VO", "B00000ILDD", "B00004BZIY", "B0001611DI", "B00000CQJZ", "B001D8W7F4", "B0024FADD8", "B00011CZRE", "B00AJLHUA8", "B00005JKF6", "B000NVT0SO", "B00006FDCD", "B0013D8LA4", "B000WC3864", "B0013D8LAE", "630512003X", "B004SIP92O", "B000AA4JL6", "B000CCW2SY", "B00000C0QO"], "bought_together": ["B000Q66Q8I", "B0087ZG7PW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005EVY8MQ", "B0087ZG7R0", "B000Q66Q8I", "B0087ZG7PW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 24947}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.95, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "0783225849", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515ZHBJZdgL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Psycho (Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "Director John Carpenter and special makeup effects master Rob Bottin teamed up for this 1982 remake of the 1951 science fiction classicThe Thing from Another World, and the result is a mixed blessing. It's got moments of highly effective terror and spine-tingling suspense, but it's mostly a showcase for some of the goriest and most horrifically grotesque makeup effects ever created for a movie. With such highlights as a dog that splits open and blossoms into something indescribably gruesome, this is the kind of movie for die-hard horror fans and anyone who slows down to stare at fatal traffic accidents. On those terms, however, it's hard not to be impressed by the movie's wild and wacky freak show. It all begins when scientists at an arctic research station discover an alien spacecraft under the thick ice, and thaw out the alien body found aboard. What they don't know is that the alien can assume any human form, and before long the scientists can't tell who's real and who's a deadly alien threat. Kurt Russell leads the battle against the terrifying intruder, and the supporting cast includes Richard Masur, Richard Dysart, Donald Moffat, and Wilford Brimley. They're all playing standard characters who are neglected by the mechanistic screenplay (based on the classic sci-fi story \"Who Goes There?\" by John W. Campbell), but Carpenter's emphasis is clearly on the gross-out effects and escalating tension. If you've got the stomach for it (and let's face it, there's a big audience for eerie gore), this is a thrill ride you won't want to miss.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0067QPVJ6", "B00004Y87O", "B00009NHC0", "B000AM6OQ2", "B00000ILDD", "B0000AOX0F", "B0009X768W", "B0024FADD8", "B000QUCQX8", "B00AEFYDM2", "B00005N5RM", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B008CYDD7I", "B005J9ZFQG", "B00005N5S5", "B000FS9FE4", "B00I9TDMRM", "B0067QPVD2", "B000RIWAVW", "B00005JA8B", "B0000AOX0A", "B00005JKFR", "B005LAIHXQ", "B003XURDAY", "B0001611DI", "B00111YM5Q", "B003UGLCIA", "B0009X76XC", "0783227434", "B00008974J", "078062856X", "B001NPD9LS", "B002VWNIDG", "B0000VCZK2", "B004L9GMBC", "B000AQKU72", "B00003CXCF", "B000YDOOHI", "B0024FAG44", "B002ZG98LO", "B000GETUDI", "B000V4UFZK", "B00AEFYXQI", "B0008191WO", "B00AEBB8VK", "B000LP6KNU", "0790729342", "B000068IEV", "0783228457", "B0024FADBA", "B000WC3864", "B0002DB5PO", "B007STBUHI", "0982332203", "B00070FX5U", "B0045HCJKS", "B00AEFY31S", "B00004TS0G", "B000IHY9TS", "B000063UR1", "B00005N7Z1", "B001VLBDD0", "B000286RNE", "B00000ILDG", "B00023P4UQ", "B00D7AM6M0", "B000096I9V", "B003YDORO0", "B00005LC4Q", "B00008G8LY", "B00005R2IS", "B00009PY4G", "B000E8M0P6", "B00AEFY2AA", "B00005JMA8", "0783241895", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005K3NR", "6305090564", "B004SIP95G", "0790729695", "B0007PALZ2", "B00AEBB91E", "B004NWPY20", "B0010X73ZG", "B001FOK70S", "B002T9H2LA", "157362408X", "B00006FDCD", "B0045HCJT4", "B003Y5H4SO", "B004SIP92O", "B00009YXHN", "B00005JMEW", "B000P0J0AQ", "B00011CZRE", "B000I2J68M", "B00AKGG828", "B00009OWI1", "B003TRMLQM"], "bought_together": ["B0067QPVJ6", "B00009NHC0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00009NHC0", "B0067QPVJ6", "B0009X768W", "B000UBMSB8"]}, "price": 12.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 131304}, "asin": "0783227507", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HQTPF200L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Thing - Collector's Edition"}

For good measure, he's castSouth Parkcreators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, as a pair of slacker pals who invent a game (blending baseball and basketball) that takes the country by storm. Intended as a satire on the raging greed of professional sports, it trades extravagantly in rudely vulgar humor; the jokes are so numerous and fly in so many directions that they're bound to offend--and amuse--everyone at some point. A key aspect of the game: defending players get to psych-out their opponents in gross and insulting ways, which is where Parker and Stone shine.

This dark, low-budget film was shot in black and white by director Darren Aronofsky. With eerie music, voice-overs, and overt symbolism enhancing the somber mood, Aronofsky has created a disturbing look at the world. Max is deeply paranoid, holed up in his apartment with his computer Euclid, obsessively studying chaos theory.  Blinding headaches and hallucinogenic visions only feed his paranoia as he attempts to remain aloof from the world, venturing out only to meet his mentor, Sol Robeson (Mark Margolis), who for some mysterious reason feels Max should take a break from his research. This movie is complex--occasionallytoocomplex--but the psychological drama and the loose sci-fi elements make this a worthwhile, albeit consuming, watch.Piwon the Director's Award at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival.--Jenny Brown", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 496232}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0784011796", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P5P0C06XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pi [VHS]"}
{"description": "Writer Ernest Thompson, who came up with the original stage play ofOn Golden Pondand adapted it for film, is lucky to have two giants of the screen give dignity and breadth to his sometimes trite dialogue. Henry Fonda, in his last role, plays a prickly English professor at the disagreeable age of 80. Visiting his summer house by a Maine lake with his wife (Katharine Hepburn), the old man forges an unlikely bond with a lonely boy, comes to terms with his daughter (Jane Fonda), and suffers disorienting effects of mild dementia. Even playing a tired old man, Fonda is an absolute lion of a movie star, and Hepburn brings her special spirit to the part of his worried bride. The onscreen relationship between Henry and Jane Fonda naturally makes one think about their much-discussed difficulties offscreen, but that's a side benefit in a movie that is really just a celebration of simple human decency. Directed by Mark Rydell (Harry and Walter Go to New York).--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002VWNIBI", "6305212112", "B00001W9G0", "B003ASLJK4", "B00DDT0JB0", "B00AEFYK5M", "B0001CNRBG", "B00005NRN8", "B00004TJKK", "B00AEBB9FA", "0767836359", "0783240171", "B0045HCJ76", "B00AEFY4CG", "B0007QJ1XE", "B000765IJK", "B00AEFY0F2", "076780676X", "B000ZM1MG4", "6305128952", "B006FE83UE", "B002GHHHGU", "B001ECDVK4", "0822208482", "B004SIP6C2", "B00AEFXD1O", "B00AEFXYOA", "B002VWNIAY", "B000TXP56C", "B003LMPKSQ", "B000YAF4MA", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B0000DIXDR", "6305236569", "B00AKGG5WG", "B002NZK5RS", "B00005MEOU", "B0000AOV4I", "B004AOECXI", "B00008CMSX", "B000JYW5B4", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00AEFYRJQ", "B00CPTUOI2", "6304698607", "B0000542C9", "0783225733", "B003BV8ICC", "B00079Z9VO", "B000FOPPC4", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B0000648ZR", "B00AEBB97S", "B004SEUJOQ", "B00004W46I", "B000YDBPAM", "B00066FAOE", "B007STBUHI", "B0007ZEOPK", "B007N31YH0", "B000BITVAG", "B00AEBBA0E", "B002M2Z3BA", "0790731886", "B00004RG62", "B0009R1TJ0", "B00070HK24", "B00009AVA5", "B009ERK1ZO", "B00004XPPC", "B00FEDP5XK", "B000Y11BBW", "B00AATV046", "B0000YTP02", "B001JNNDLU", "B0028ZDJN0", "B0013D8LH2", "B0001AVZA8", "B0006J28LO", "B000WTVZHQ", "B0057P4SAQ", "B0001I55R4", "B00005V5NS", "B00AEFYNG8", "B007XTDWKQ", "B001ECDVJU", "0783230486", "B00066FBQG"], "bought_together": ["B002VWNIBI", "6305212112"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DDT0JB0", "B00AEFYK5M", "B00004TJKK", "B003ASLJK4"]}, "price": 24.5, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 133435}, "asin": "0784011648", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JR83516RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "On Golden Pond"}

{"description": "Ever since the late '70s when the Australian New Wave was in full surge, Down  Under directors have delivered movies that often hit you like news from another planet. Offbeat characters, weird narrative twists, and a tart  mixture of laughs and catastrophe--this is the juice that fuels such flicks asProof,The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,Strictly Ballroom,Heavenly Creatures, and most certainlyMuriel's Wedding. Directed by P.J.  Hogan (who would go on to helm the Hollywood hitMy Best Friend's Wedding),  this little gem follows tradition by featuring an authentic misfit: Muriel  (Toni Collette), a great overweight horse of a girl obsessed with getting  married and the music of ABBA. Appropriately, we first meet Muriel at a  wedding, all trussed up in a leopardskin number she's boosted for the  occasion. When her snotty peers insist that she give up the bridal bouquet to  someone who might actually get hitched, when one of the guests turns out to be a clerk in the very store where Muriel ripped off her outfit--you gotta  laugh, she's such an unmitigated mess. A loser, her philandering politician father (Bill Hunter) calls her--along with his doormat wife and his other  couch-potato offspring. But this movie's no exercise in geek-bashing. As  Muriel takes up with feisty Rhonda (Rachel Griffiths) and moves from Porpoise  Spit to the big city, her good-hearted grin and zest for life draw us in  despite hilarious gaffes and mishaps. (Making out with a boy for the first  time, Muriel suddenly finds herself awash in styrofoam: the oaf has unzipped  the beanbag chair instead of her skin-tight leather pants.)Muriel's Weddingcovers territory Hollywood would banish from a comedy--Rhonda's cancer, the  suicide of Muriel's mother, a marriage of convenience to an arrogant  athlete--yet, like its heroine, it never loses its sense of humor, its will to move on to whatever good thing might happen next. Everyone in the  idiosyncratic cast is terrific, but it's Toni Collette's Dancing Queen who  makesMuriel's Weddinga cinematic celebration you won't forget.--Kathleen  Murphy", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SIPAJG", "B00001U0DW", "B001CDR1F6", "0792843983", "B0000714BP", "B004VJJGFG", "B00BXL249K", "B00005JN1K", "B000089794", "B00006FMUW", "6305428425", "B000CCBCAS", "B00005JNC5", "B00003CXPD", "0792833198", "B0001HAGRE", "B000CCW2P2", "B00EPH8SBM", "B0045HCJGW", "B008NNY8TK", "B00BTYJYR6", "B001GKJ2DY", "0767827740", "B00A33J8YS", "B00CMQIDKY", "B00005JLD4", "B00DW5IJR6", "B003EYVXQ4", "B007UW9W5U", "B000002GLW", "B000ETRCN0", "B00005ALS0", "B00BAYLS1K", "B0001L3LUO", "B00AEFYNG8", "B00006AW0I", "6305283516", "B004XVMCQ2", "6305882592", "B000001DZO", "B000EHRVOW", "B001PPGAIA", "B004U7MR4G", "B0016MJ6T2", "B000087F7Q", "B000023VTP", "B00001W9G0", "B000AYYVME", "B0000542C7", "B00005N5SA", "B008LFYZAM", "B001DB6J6Y", "B00KNALRZ4", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00003CY5G", "B00005K3NU", "B0011FDVD6", "B00006ZXSL", "B00004TWZH", "B004D45NYC", "B00005JL7Q", "B000FO0AA6", "B000J103OI", "B005EVJCOA", "B00004VVMZ", "B00DL46ZN8", "B0045HCJRG", "0783225482", "B000068V9U", "B0001WPQJ2", "B00005JKGK", "B000063ING", "B007UW9W32", "B000092T3P", "B000765IJK", "B000069HZP", "B00AEFY4TO", "B000035Z5H", "B00005JNDZ", "0857687247", "B000NA1WDQ", "B004SIP9VA", "B000ELJAEM", "B0007IO6NM", "6304696558", "B004XVMCMG", "B0021L8UOY", "B00AEFY4CG", "B002GHHHJC", "B0053TWVQ4", "B001C47ZOW", "B0043X1FOU", "B009B1EPQ4", "B0000A02Y4", "B00008R9KD", "B0064MT1FI", "B0001I55M4", "6305622914", "B00CPIXOEY"], "bought_together": ["B004SIPAJG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0792843983", "B0000714BP", "0792833198", "B00EPH8SBM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 57288}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.99, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "0788814958", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/7176GF4V61L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Muriel's Wedding"}

{"description": "Steven Spielberg, proving he's one of the few modern filmmakers who has the visual fluency to be capable of making a great silent film, took a melodramatic, D.W. Griffith-inspired approach to filming Alice Walker's novel. His tactics made the film controversial, but also a popular hit. You can argue with the appropriateness of Spielberg's decision, but his astonishing facility with images is undeniable--from the exhilarating and eye-popping opening shots of children playing in paradisiacal purple fields to the way he conveys the brutality of a rape by showing hanging leather belts banging against the head of the shaking bed. In a way it's a shame that Whoopi Goldberg, a stage monologist who made her screen debut in this movie, went on to become so famous, because it was, in part, her unfamiliarity that made her understated performance as Celie so effective. (This may be the first and last time that the adjectiveunderstatedcan be applied to Goldberg.) Nominated for 11 Academy Awards, including best picture and actress (supporting players Oprah Winfrey and Margaret Avery were also nominated), it was quite a scandal--and a crushing blow to Spielberg--when it won none.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000Y11B8K", "6305428409", "B000BOH8X2", "0788815474", "B002VWNIBI", "B00AEFYG3S", "B00007L4KF", "B003BV8I3Q", "0156028352", "B00005AQML", "B002CA68NO", "B00066FAVW", "B00465I1CE", "6305212112", "B00066FAQW", "B004FK5EDY", "B003HKN534", "B00004TJKK", "B0009S4IGA", "B001NLJ3NU", "B00AEFY4CG", "0783230524", "B001P3SA94", "B00066FAC6", "B003Y5H4ZC", "B005CGI4O6", "B000B5XOSY", "B00AMSM9AO", "B00441GZ1Y", "B00CDWQNZ4", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00BLN4V6E", "B00EV4EUT8", "B00AEFXTKO", "B0041QSZS8", "B004A8ZWVK", "0822003082", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B000765IJK", "B000P0J0CE", "6305505780", "B005LAIH1S", "0792846443", "B002M2Z3BA", "B003ASLJK4", "B0000560W6", "B0000714BT", "B00DW5IL2E", "B00003L9CK", "B00AEBB9FA", "B002NZK5VO", "B002VWNICM", "B00AEFXP8K", "B000059TFO", "B00000JGHV", "B00AEFY6TW", "B001K98MGE", "B002U4UZQI", "B000PE0GRI", "B000P0J0EW", "0783240171", "B0018RNF60", "B001JV5BF8", "B0006IIOHC", "B00005LC4D", "B00005JLQT", "B00HW3EI3I", "B00AEFYNG8", "0783231202", "B0000WN0NW", "6305236569", "B00005B8UA", "B00005KAQP", "B0009R1TJ0", "B002VECM4A", "B003LMPKSQ", "B0058KGHX6", "B00AEFXY6I", "B00BNV9WCW", "B000JLTRH2", "B001JV5BC6", "B0041H55S0", "B000P0J0EM", "B000069I0E", "B002CAWNEM", "B005ZMBEXU", "B00005RDAN", "0156031825", "1558908390", "B002CWKU36", "B003Y5H58S", "B000YIGNHW", "B000XA5JWG", "B000BQ7J8Y", "0790731533", "B0068FZ0W4", "B00081U7HC", "B00004Y2R1", "0151191549", "0792844874"], "bought_together": ["6305428409", "B000BOH8X2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0156028352", "B004A8ZWVK", "6305428409", "B000BOH8X2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 55488}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.59, "brand": "", "asin": "0790729717", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B6EPCQKZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Color Purple"}
{"description": "Director William Friedkin was a hot ticket in Hollywood after the success ofThe French Connection, and he turned heads (in more ways than one) when he decided to makeThe Exorcistas his follow-up film. Adapted by William Peter Blatty from hiscontroversial bestseller, this shocking 1973 thriller set an intense and often-copied milestone for screen terror with its unflinching depiction of a young girl (Linda Blair) who is possessed by an evil spirit. Jason Miller and Max von Sydow are perfectly cast as the priests who risk their sanity and their lives to administer the rites of demonic exorcism, and Ellen Burstyn plays Blair's mother, who can only stand by in horror as her daughter's body is wracked by satanic disfiguration. One of the most frightening films ever made,The Exorcistwas mysteriously plagued by troubles during production, and the years have not diminished its capacity to disturb even the most stoical viewers. The film is presented in letterbox format on digital video disc, with a soundtrack that's guaranteed to curdle your blood.

{"description": "From its cleverly choreographed opening sequence to its heart-stopping climax on a rampant carousel, this 1951 Hitchcock classic readily earns its reputation as one of the director's finest examples of timeless cinematic suspense. It's not just a ripping-good thriller but a film student's delight and a perversely enjoyable battle of wits between tennis pro Guy (Farley Granger) and his mysterious, sycophantic admirer, Bruno (Robert Walker), who proposes a &quot;criss-cross&quot; scheme of traded murders. Bruno agrees to kill Guy's unfaithful wife, in return for which Guy will (or so it seems) kill Bruno's spiteful father. With an emphasis on narrative and visual strategy, Hitchcock controls the escalating tension with a master's flair for cinematic design, and the plot (coscripted by Raymond Chandler) is so tightly constructed that you'll be white-knuckled even after multiple viewings.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002HOEQ2", "B000CCW2SY", "B000ECX0O2", "B0045HCJ9E", "B00871C09S", "B0087ZG7R0", "B001D8W7EK", "B00000CQJZ", "B000A9QK7I", "B00AEBB97S", "B000CCW2TS", "B001D8W7F4", "B000ECX0Q0", "B0002HOEQM", "B001D8W7EU", "B0087ZG7OI", "B00000C0QO", "B002GSXKQA", "B000CCW2U2", "B0002HOER6", "B0087ZG7PW", "B000ECX0S8", "6305999872", "B00AEBB89C", "B003ZEQMH8", "B0002HOEQW", "B00004XPPK", "B000A1INJE", "B00008LDNZ", "B0002HOEQC", "B000CCW2UW", "B000FFJYA2", "B009RWRINE", "B000CCW2UC", "B0002HOEPS", "B0050FXDDQ", "B002VWNIAY", "B005EVY8MQ", "B0006HBV3C", "B0010YSD7W", "B00K6D1QV8", "B000025RE7", "B005H8G78O", "B000MGBSDK", "B007Y1NR1W", "B000PMFRVU", "B00005LC4D", "B0009ML1Z2", "B00065GX64", "B0045HCJQW", "B00AEBBA7W", "B00003CXBZ", "B000244F2S", "B0000549B1", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B008BFSMBA", "B000ECX0QU", "B000FFJYAW", "B004NWPY3E", "B00006RCO1", "B00005AUK9", "B0045HCJ8U", "B00AEFYO5I", "B0008ENIAC", "B00005JKF6", "B000CNE088", "B00DZP1C9K", "B00005RDRL", "B000UVV25Q", "B002945DUM", "B0045HCJHG", "B00AEFXD1O", "B0002ERWZ0", "078323502X", "B000KGGJ1I", "B00003CXBU", "B006TTC5WC", "B000KIX8VK", "B00000JNVC", "B00004W229", "B004CZRE44", "B00AEBB8OC", "B00AMEZDK6", "B000FFJYAC", "B006FE83UE", "B0007US7EY", "B0010AN7Z4", "B000CNE08I", "B0014Z4OMU", "B00553K8DQ", "B000B8380A", "B000244EYW", "B0009S4IKQ", "B00074DY0M", "B00004TJKI", "B005152C9G"], "bought_together": ["B0002HOEQ2", "B0045HCJ9E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00871C09S", "B0002HOEQ2", "B000CCW2SY", "B0045HCJ9E"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 124487}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.89, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "0790731029", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J4BhbK2UL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Strangers on a Train"}
{"description": "When Tim Burton and Michael Keaton announced that they'd had enough of theBatmanfranchise, director Joel Schumacher stepped in (with Burton as coproducer) to make this action-packed extravaganza starring Val Kilmer as the caped crusader. Batman is up against two of Gotham City's most colorful criminals, the Riddler (a role tailor-made for funnyman Jim Carrey) and the diabolical Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones), who join forces to conquer Gotham's population with a brain-draining device. Nicole Kidman plays the seductive psychologist who wants to know what makes Batman tick. Boasting a redesigned Batmobile and plenty of new Bat hardware,Batman Foreveralso introduces Robin the Boy Wonder (Chris O'Donnell) whose close alliance with Batman led more than a few critics to ponder the series' homoerotic subtext. No matter how you interpret it, Schumacher's take on theBatmanlegacy is simultaneously amusing, lavishly epic, and prone to chronic sensory overload.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001OST0M6", "B000P0J06U", "B000P0J06K", "B00005JNJV", "B004LWZWGA", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00005LOUK", "B0006L0LOS", "B000IJ79X4", "B000IJ79XE", "B001CDR1FG", "B000IJ79WU", "B004YJMQDW", "B000J10EQU", "B00IZZDWKM", "B0000959N0", "B000AYELVA", "B00003CXE4", "B00005JKWJ", "B000AQOHNA", "B004LWZW42", "B00008G8M5", "B000IJ79UW", "0780624890", "B001DHXT20", "B002GSXKN8", "B0009UZG28", "B00005JNTU", "B000AYELVU", "B000A9QKLE", "B000A9QKL4", "B001GCUO1Q", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001VLBDD0", "B008JFUPFI", "B0090SI56Y", "B000068MBS", "B004EPZ07K", "B00081912E", "B005COPWZW", "0783235070", "B00BTYMPUY", "B004SIP9P6", "B000OYC7BW", "B00005JMQW", "B004SIP9O2", "B0007G89FU", "B001QB9H1U", "B000VI70QS", "B0014Z4ON4", "B000NIBURQ", "B001DJLD2G", "B000UR9T8C", "B00K7IPFSM", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000A9QKLO", "B000IJ79VQ", "B00F4FFO8E", "B00005JKCH", "B000ARXF96", "B0007V6ITE", "0790732157", "B0002IQMAM", "B00AEBB9SM", "B00005N5S5", "B000P0J06A", "B00GZ0ML2Y", "B00JL6L4UY", "B001AGXEAG", "B001ECDVKE", "B000GETUDI", "B005LAIHYU", "B008JFUS0U", "B001PPLIEG", "B000W1V5VU", "B001QTXM5Y", "B000HCO83Q", "B004SIP9MY", "6304765258", "B002GOAH1A", "B00JPS7HOA", "B00E5I2MCM", "B005LAIGW8", "B00006FI0R", "B00177YA1K", "B0007P0Y7C", "B001GCUO0W", "B0000B00KB", "B00080ZFZW", "B002GHHHN8", "B003AWRM9W", "B008JFUO72", "B00005JNTI", "B000HT38BM", "B0049IHWYG", "B00JF5GAIW", "B0009RCPY8", "B0000VCZMK", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B005J9ZFQG"], "bought_together": ["B001OST0M6", "B000P0J06U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002GSXKN8", "B000P0J06K", "B000B5XOSO", "B00005JNJV"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 161577}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.18, "brand": "Warner Bros", "asin": "0790731002", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51V0HRD00TL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Batman Forever"}
{"description": "Stanley Kubrick'sThe Shiningis less an adaptation of Stephen King's bestselling horror novel than a complete reimagining of it from the inside out. In King's book, the Overlook Hotel is a haunted place that takes possession of its off-season caretaker and provokes him to murderous rage against his wife and young son. Kubrick's movie is an existential Road Runner cartoon (his steadicam scurrying through the hotel's labyrinthine hallways), in which the cavernously empty spaces inside the Overlook mirror the emptiness in the soul of the blocked writer, who's settled in for a long winter's hibernation. As many have pointed out, King's protagonist goes mad, but Kubrick's Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is Looney Tunes from the moment we meet him--all arching eyebrows and mischievous grin. (Both Nicholson and Shelley Duvall reach new levels of hysteria in their performances, driven to extremes by the director's fanatical demands for take after take after take.)The Shiningis terrifying--but not in the way fans of the novel might expect. When it was redone as a TV miniseries (reportedly because of King's dissatisfaction with the Kubrick film), the famous topiary-animal attack (which was deemed impossible to film in 1980) was there--but the deeper horror was lost. Kubrick'sThe Shininggets under your skin and chills your bones; it stays with you, inhabits you, haunts you. And there's no place to hide...--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300267881", "0790734079", "B00005ATQA", "6302038308", "6300182770", "B0009RRUKW", "0783235607", "0783228317", "B00000J2KZ", "B00004RNAC", "0790736039", "B00023NRSM", "6304508611", "6300182878", "6302921058", "6304509154", "0783216084", "6300214087", "B00004W5UA", "6301427076", "630268644X", "B000003KHS", "B000AMW2TK", "0790700506", "6300181340", "6300214753", "6302054982", "0784011923", "6305363668", "6303686796", "6305095566", "630021639X", "6302822688", "6305576173", "0783246641", "6304994540", "6303953425", "B00004U8PA", "0792158261", "0792100085", "6300213986", "6300189015", "630533577X", "6300214826", "0792846303", "6304288433", "6300147630", "0792842111", "B000007OY0", "0790741512", "6302158176", "0792846311", "6300183416", "0800103106", "B000005PFL", "6300183211", "0790733927", "6301666569", "6301871952", "0767825411", "630339406X", "6303109950", "6300216500", "6300214192", "6300262731", "6303257674", "6304214502", "630018627X", "6300214311", "1558807381", "0792839234", "0767819187", "B00005B238", "0790731975", "6303579388", "B000059HFB", "6302798450", "B00000FZCU", "6303651461", "6303566391", "6302642175", "6301971582", "6300218058", "6301094352", "6300184064", "6300181278", "6304457383", "6300214672", "6300262855", "0800125762", "6303257305"], "bought_together": ["0790734079"], "also_viewed": ["6300147630", "6300182878", "B00005ATQA", "6300189015", "6300267881", "B00023NRSM", "6300213005", "6303953425", "0307743659", "6303148352", "0790734079", "B001AQT0Z4", "6300183211", "0784011923", "B00BBND56G", "0788806270"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 268792}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0790705141", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5106FV0S4PL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Shining [VHS]"}
{"description": "EDITOR'S NOTE: According to a Warner Home Video technician involved in  the production ofThe Stanley Kubrick Collection, Kubrick authorized all aspects of theCollection, from the use of Digital Component Video (or \"D-1\") masters originally approved in 1989, to the use of minimalist screen menus, chapter stops, and (in the case of2001: A Space OdysseyandThe Shiningon DVD) supplementary materials. Full-screen presentation ofThe ShiningandFull Metal Jacketwas also approved by Kubrick, who recomposed his original framing,  reportedly believing that those films looked best on video in the full-screen format. (In fact, the original theatrical aspect ratio ofThe Shiningwas 1.66:1, meaning that a relatively small portion of the image is lost.) Kubrick also chose mono over stereo,  believing that inconsistencies in theatrical sound systems resulted in loss of control over theatrical presentation. In every respect, the Warner spokesman  said, the films in theCollectionremain as Kubrick approved them. Any future attempt to remaster or alter them would  have to be approved by an appointee of the Kubrick estate.", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301115430", "6300214826", "630018627X", "6304935811", "6301979761", "B00006C7G9", "B00000J2L7", "0784011923", "0790748169", "630407185X", "0800132009", "6302816580", "6301208773", "B00000JGEI", "B000BT8VVK", "B00000IO4G", "630018224X", "0792133153", "6300248135", "6302054982", "630300394X", "B00000K3AN", "6303696813", "6303020089", "6302415853", "6304826133", "6303029027", "0783235607", "6304259131", "B000065JH1", "0800179552", "6301217977", "B00007CVYA", "0800116917", "B0000CDL3W", "6304214502", "6302935148", "6304414099", "6303168507", "076783819X", "6300248089", "0800125762", "630018403X", "6300213005", "6303269834", "6303109950", "6300246965", "B00006IUOZ", "6300183211", "6304925131", "0783202253", "0783107986", "079213690X", "B000005XXG", "B00000FZCU", "0800187873", "6300214540"], "bought_together": ["6301115430", "6300214826"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 348239}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0790701251", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZM1C6TC7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Full Metal Jacket [VHS]"}

Sheriff Bart teams up with deputy Jim (Gene Wilder) to foil the railroad-building scheme of the nefarious Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman).

The humor is so juvenile and crude that you just have to surrender to it; highlights abound, from the lunkheaded Alex Karras as the ox-riding Mongo to Madeline Kahn's uproarious send-up of Marlene Dietrich as saloon songstress Lili Von Shtupp. Adding to the comedic excess is the infamous campfire scene involving a bunch of hungry cowboys, heaping servings of baked beans and, well, you get the idea.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000G6BLRE", "B000G6BLWE", "B003CRM6PA", "B00AEFXDO6", "B000G6BLW4", "0792844890", "B0000A02TZ", "B00005O3VC", "B000G6BLQU", "B0009UC810", "B0009IOR5M", "B006TTC5GS", "B000M7XR9W", "B00AEFYVMO", "B00287Z18Y", "B000BMY2LU", "B00158K0QU", "B0008JIJ2O", "B000Z8GZYW", "B00AMSQBRQ", "B00441GZ2S", "B00003CXC3", "B000BYA4J2", "B000K405CY", "B00005UEQX", "B00D3LA6AW", "B000A7DVR2", "B000VE439Y", "B00AEBB99Q", "B0001ZX0O2", "B00407PO3W", "B004P9UWM8", "B00004RJ73", "B000A2UBNE", "B00AEFYPAC", "B00005V0XF", "B000G6BLYC", "B00AEFYJI0", "B000P0J0EW", "B002N57KG2", "B0000A14TA", "B007STBUHI", "B00008K76U", "B0019HQICW", "B00005JKCB", "B00BTYRB1C", "B0014Z4OMU", "6305609764", "B007P9HW3M", "B000LBL3TK", "B000E6ESJ4", "B000BKJ762", "B00AMSQBUI", "B00AEFXXMI", "0783227388", "B00005U5A8", "B000P0J09M", "B00079Z9VO", "0792833279", "B00AJCUL1C", "B000089765", "0790742012", "B003ASLJS6", "B004SIP6LS", "B003ELKNH2", "B000EQHXOG", "B000A2UBN4", "B0018Q1F72", "B00004TJQK", "B00AEBB9DM", "6305212112", "B004EPZ084", "B00AEFY3MC", "B0000CBY1C", "B002VWNIAY", "B004FQX5B6", "0783235070", "B000HEZESM", "B000W1SZBS", "0790729342", "B0045HCJKS", "0783227884", "B002VWNIEA", "B00441GZ14", "B000F6ZIII", "B0007ZEOCS", "6304711905", "B006TTC50Y", "B0038Z5SOM", "B003AWRMCE", "B004L9GMBC", "B00BMJ7ZKG", "B005F96UJ6", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEFZ8OY", "B008QE9XD2", "B00005PJ6O", "B0019L21GA", "B001AEF6C2", "B002ZG96ZC"], "bought_together": ["B000G6BLWE", "B00AEFXDO6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000E6ESIK", "B003CRM6PA", "B007NQLA9O", "0792844890"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 48893}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.98, "brand": "", "asin": "0790731487", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51V99G30KSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blazing Saddles"}

His investigation is a source of constant aggravation for Miami police lieutenant Lois Einhorn (Sean Young), who turns out to be packing more than a pistol under her skirt.Friendsfans will appreciate the presence of Courtney Cox, who remains admirably straight-faced as the Dolphins' publicist and Ace's would-be girlfriend, but of course it's Carrey who steals the show with shameless abandon.

{"description": "Winner of four Academy Awards, including best picture, director, supporting actor, and best editing, Clint Eastwood's 1992 masterpiece stands as one of the greatest and most thematically compelling Westerns ever made. &quot;The movie summarized everything I feel about the Western,&quot; said Eastwood at the time of the film's release. &quot;The moral is the concern with gunplay.&quot; To illustrate that theme, Eastwood stars as a retired, once-ruthless killer-turned-gentle-widower and hog farmer. He accepts one last bounty-hunter mission--to find the men who brutalized a prostitute--to help support his two motherless children. Joined by his former partner (Morgan Freeman) and a cocky greenhorn (Jaimz Woolvett), he takes on a corrupt sheriff (Oscar winner Gene Hackman) in a showdown that makes the viewer feel the full impact of violence and its corruption of the soul.

{"description": "Whether or not you can sympathize with its fascistic-vigilante approach to law enforcement,Dirty Harry(directed by star Clint Eastwood's longtime friend and directorial mentor, Don Siegel) is one hell of a cop thriller. The movie makes evocative use of its San Francisco locations as cop Harry Callahan (Eastwood) tracks the elusive &quot;Scorpio killer&quot; who has been terrorizing the city by the Bay. As the psychopath's trail grows hotter, Harry becomes increasingly impatient and intolerant of the frustrating obstacles (departmental red tape, individuals' civil rights) that he feels are keeping him from doing his job. A characteristically taut and tense piece of filmmaking from Siegel (Invasion of the Body Snatchers,The Shootist,Escape from Alcatraz), it also remains a fascinating slice of American pop culture. It was a big hit (followed by four sequels) that obviously reflected--or exploited--the almost obsessive or paranoid fears and frustrations many Americans felt about crime in the streets. At a time when &quot;law and order&quot; was a familiar slogan for political candidates, Harry Callahan may have represented neither, but from his point of view his job was simple: stop criminals. To him that end justified any means he deemed necessary.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790733390", "079073172X", "6300216500", "0792836510", "6300269043", "0790751216", "0792837312", "6302890721", "079284100X", "6302054982", "6304429711", "0784011923", "6302610702", "6302360978", "6300182452", "0792110188", "6300263673", "B000005PF5", "0792835077", "B0000068SI", "6303020089", "630442972X", "6300214826", "6300183211", "B000003KDG", "6301976061", "B00000J2KZ", "630118663X", "0790734079", "6303212263", "6300214060", "6301327845", "0783222955", "6300271331", "B00000K2SC", "0792842464", "B000005PJ6", "6304437315", "0792133153", "6301802330", "6304025831", "6300181405", "6302787564", "0790735423", "6303029027", "0792108868", "0790751267", "6304509154", "0790705141", "B000007OY0", "6300269639", "0800100832", "6303686796", "630281622X", "6304258984", "079284517X", "0792839234", "6303920098", "0792110285", "6305622825", "6302712009", "0790733927", "6301586026", "0800125762", "6302596092", "630018224X", "0790748169", "0792839846", "6301971809", "6303506291", "6305576173", "0783223218", "6300214540", "0783241542", "6303313345"], "bought_together": ["0790733390"], "also_viewed": ["079073172X", "B005GJTZZG", "0790737744", "0790751267", "0792836510", "630118663X", "0790733390"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 365837}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.94, "brand": "", "asin": "0790731975", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VY4VS01BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dirty Harry [VHS]"}
{"description": "Readers of John Berendt's bestselling novel were bound to be at least somewhat disappointed by this big-screen adaptation, but despite mixed reaction from critics and audiences, there's still plenty to admire about director Clint Eastwood's take on the material. Readers will surely miss the rich atmosphere and societal detail that Berendt brought to his &quot;Savannah story,&quot; and the movie can only scratch the surface of Georgian history, tradition, and wealthy decadence underlying Berendt's fact-based murder mystery. Still, Eastwood maintains an assured focus on the wonderful eccentrics of Savannah, most notably a gay Savannah antiques dealer (superbly played by Kevin Spacey), who may or may not have killed his friend and alleged lover (Jude Law). John Cusack plays theTown & Countryjournalist who arrives in Savannah to find much more than he bargained for--including the city's legendary drag queen Lady Chablis (playing &quot;herself&quot;)--and John Lee Hancock's smoothly adapted screenplay succeeds in bringing Berendt's characters vividly to life with plenty of flavorful dialogue.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_viewed": ["0679751521", "B003ZHR6RK", "B00BXUASTE", "B00H7LJ2UO", "B00GMV8LIO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 130929}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790734680", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J385SC76L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Midnight in the Garden of Good &amp; Evil [VHS]"}

{"description": "While the series pilotBabylon 5: The Gatheringestablishes the characters and introduces the conflicts that will become central to the series, it also draws upon a rich history that is continually alluded to but never fully explained.Babylon 5: In the Beginning, produced in the hiatus between the fourth and fifth seasons of the series, packs all that history--and more--into a prequel stuffed to the hatches with the epic doings of Earth, Minbar, Narn, and Centauri in the days before theBabylonstations were built. Told in almost fairy-tale fashion by Londo Molari to a pair of children, the movie explicates the ill-fated first meeting between representatives of Earth and Minbar, the devastating war, the sudden surrender, and the universe-altering secret of Jeffrey Sinclair. It also gives the early histories of characters who will become central to the series, in particular Londo and G'Kar. Ostensibly created to catch recent converts up with the series as it made its transition to a new network, the movie is infused with the epic sweep and storytelling confidence producer-writer Michael J. Straczynski and his cast and crew had developed by the fourth season. It's an elegant, compelling addition to theBabylon 5universe and a dramatic highlight of the series. As an introduction, though, it gives away the mystery that pervades the shadowy history slowly revealed through the first three seasons--it's actually better seen from the vantage point of the fifth season.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000CEXFYW", "B002BAW6GS"], "also_viewed": ["B00005NTNP"]}, "price": 9.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 555635}, "asin": "0790736691", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X1T25ZCWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Babylon 5: In the Beginning [VHS]"}

A high-wattage star vehicle as only Hollywood can make,The Bodyguardstars Houston as a pop-music diva (nowthere'sa stretch) and Kevin Costner as the stern bodyguard who is assigned to protect her after the singer receives some nasty death threats. Pop star and bodyguard don't hit it off at first, but they wear down each others' defenses, and before long Houston is baring her tonsils with a rousing rendition of the Dolly Parton chestnut &quot;I Will Always Love You.&quot; The film, written by Lawrence Kasden, was originally intended for Steve McQueen, but the script languished for years before Houston took an interest in the project. A proposed sequel would potentially have starred Costner and Princess Diana, until Diana's tragic death precluded that possibility.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFY4CG", "B000002VMD", "B000065V3J", "B00066FAVW", "B00081U7HC", "B0000DIXDR", "B002NZK5TQ", "B004AOECXI", "B002VWNID6", "B00AEBB9NM", "0792844874", "B000KF0GWW", "B00AEFYRP0", "B00009WVSL", "B00AEFY5TI", "B008Y1YJN6", "0767817729", "6305428409", "B001ECDVK4", "B00AEFXZ1C", "B000765IJK", "B009J2VR3Y", "B000P0J0EM", "B003AWRM9M", "B0045HCJJ4", "B0002WZTOI", "B00066FAC6", "6304806434", "B00004ST9Q", "1558908315", "B00005B6JZ", "B002GHHHHO", "B000683VI4", "B0068FZ0GK", "B00AEFXZJE", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEFY0F2", "6301971345", "B0068FZ0O2", "B0000TANUI", "B001ILFUBE", "B00005ATZT", "B000E6ESI0", "B003UEYBPI", "B00AEFXX9Q", "078324021X", "B003ASLJIQ", "B000P0J0EW", "B007SPPANM", "B000YAF4Q6", "B000ARXF96", "B000P0J092", "B00066FAQW", "B000AP04FG", "B00AEBB9IM", "B000YDBPAM", "B000E5N6LG", "B00004STUL", "B003ASLJQI", "6304765266", "B00B83ROIE", "B003ASLJK4", "B00AMEZDJW", "B00AEFXP8K", "0790730979", "B003Y5H4ZC", "B003Y5H58S", "6305133468", "B00AEBB8NS", "B002AT8KD8", "B0000B1OFL", "B002O3Z50G", "B0010YSD8Q", "B00AEBB8YW", "B0000524E5", "B000E5N684", "B00004WG2F", "B000065V3H", "076780676X", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000P0J0BK", "B0007PLLBU", "B00AEFYG3S", "B000BITV9W", "0767803434", "B000FI8MPW", "B0001MMGC2", "B000053VB4", "B000JYW5B4", "B00006HAWN", "B001LMAK88", "0062238396", "6304711891", "B002VWNIBI", "B004AOECTC", "B000FWHW7C", "B00AEFXTKO", "B00005JKWX", "B002NZK5VO", "0783225504"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFY4CG", "B00081U7HC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFY4CG", "B002U4UYYQ", "B004AOECXI", "B0009HLD4Q"]}, "price": 22.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 44679}, "asin": "0790729709", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BN0KS0T0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Bodyguard (Full Screen Edition)"}
{"description": "A favorite film of some of the world's greatest filmmakers, including Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg, John Ford'sThe Searchershas earned its place in the legacy of great American films for a variety of reasons. Perhaps most notably, it's the definitive role for John Wayne as an icon of the classic Western--the hero (or antihero) who must stand alone according to the unwritten code of the West. The story takes place in Texas in 1868; Wayne plays Ethan Edwards, a Confederate veteran who visits his brother and sister-in-law at their ranch and is horrified when they are killed by marauding Comanches. Ethan's search for a surviving niece (played by young Natalie Wood) becomes an all-consuming obsession. With the help of a family friend (Jeffrey Hunter) who is himself part Cherokee, Ethan hits the trail on a five-year quest for revenge. At the peak of his masterful talent, director Ford crafts this classic tale as an embittered examination of racism and blind hatred, provoking Wayne to give one of the best performances of his career. As with many of Ford's classic Westerns,The Searchersmust contend with revisionism in its stereotypical treatment of \"savage\" Native Americans, and the film's visual beauty (the final shot is one of the great images in all of Western culture) is compromised by some uneven performances and stilted dialogue. Still, this is undeniably one of the greatest Westerns ever made.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300268470", "630197705X", "0792106989", "6301325508", "0782008348", "6303057225", "6300181588", "6300268799", "0792102320", "6301797922", "6301802330", "6303192254", "0792838556", "6301805518", "6304071876", "6301798759", "6300184951", "6300269884", "6300267830", "1555265952", "6300181715", "0792107128", "6303599052", "6300208281", "0783221347", "B00004RFFA", "6304457308", "6304457278", "079284517X", "6301977165", "6300268748", "B000051S3Z", "B001E419N8", "B000M7BEPQ", "B000GX4476", "0792110188", "6301628454", "6300988473", "0800132009", "B000059HGY", "6301805615", "B00004WZR1", "6301670159", "0792107683", "630310374X", "0783235607", "6303942830", "6302884438", "6305237115", "630150528X", "0792834879", "0790743213", "0783235593", "6304259131", "6301798503", "630018224X", "6302130379", "B000006N70", "6304935811"], "also_viewed": ["6303599052", "6303168507", "6300269884", "6301802330", "0792106989"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 293111}, "asin": "0790736918", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G79RSPRAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Searchers [VHS]"}
{"description": "Philip Kaufman's intimate epic about theMercuryastronauts (based on Tom Wolfe's book) was one of the most ambitious and spectacularly exciting movies of the 1980s.  It surprised almost everybody by not becoming a smash hit. By all rights, the film should have been every bit the success thatApollo 13would later become;The Right Stuffis not only just as thrilling, but it is also a bigger and better movie. Combining history (both established and revisionist), grand mythmaking (and myth puncturing), adventure, melodrama, behind-the-scenes dish, spectacular visuals, and a down-to-earth sense of humor,The Right Stuffchronicles NASA's efforts to put a man in orbit. Such an achievement would be the first step toward President Kennedy's goal of reaching the moon, and, perhaps most important of all, would win a crucial public relations/morale victory over the Soviets, who had delivered a stunning blow to American pride by launchingSputnik, the first satellite. The movie contrasts the daring feats of the unsung test pilots--one of whom, Chuck Yeager, embodied more than anyone else the skill and spirit of Wolfe's title--against the heavily publicized (and sanitized) accomplishments of theMercuryastronauts. Through no fault of their own, the spacemen became prisoners of the heroic images the government created for them in order to capture the public's imagination. The casting is inspired; the film features Sam Shepard as the legendary Yeager, Ed Harris as John Glenn, Dennis Quaid as &quot;Gordo&quot; Cooper, Scott Glenn as Alan Shepard, Fred Ward as Gus Grissom, Scott Wilson as Scott Crossfield, and Pamela Reed and Veronica Cartwright are superb in their thankless roles as astronauts' wives.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783225733", "B0006FYOTC", "B002O3Z4QQ", "B001BEK8CY", "B002NHX1YK", "B003AWRMBA", "0312427565", "B000XJ5TPE", "B00008K76U", "B00005J760", "B000CEXEWA", "B004L9GMBC", "B002GHHHKQ", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00004XPPC", "B001O4C6K8", "B0045HCJ9O", "B00BTYOYK8", "B000FTCLR6", "B0002V7OI8", "B00005JPLE", "0792838408", "0812992520", "B00080ETMM", "B000055Y0X", "B00AEFYBA6", "B000V7O0DU", "B004AOECXI", "B0015NORDW", "B000EHSVS2", "B00371QQ2U", "0767802470", "B00066FBQG", "B00A33J8YS", "B0006B2A42", "B00080ZG10", "B00319ECI8", "B00AEFXVOI", "B00008G8M4", "B007N31YH0", "B00AEFYENK", "B003ASLJRC", "B004FQX5A2", "B0000JBALO", "B000E1NXJ0", "B00004U2MS", "B000MNOX94", "B0026IQTR2", "B00003CWU3", "B00000G3PA", "B0026VBOJC", "B008JZRMQI", "B00003CXHJ", "0553256742", "B00008G8LY", "B00005T7HZ", "0743200799", "0553050931", "B000FZETR0", "B000EHSVSC", "B0000694Z3", "0783225547", "B0002WZTOI", "B002O3Z50G", "1439148813", "6305428514", "B0068FZ0GK", "B00003CXA6", "B0001NBMH6", "B00026L9CU", "B000YAF4MA", "B002GHHHPQ", "B0087ZG7HK", "B000KX0IOA", "B0001US66Y"], "bought_together": ["0783225733", "B0006FYOTC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0783225733", "B002ZNJXP8", "B003AWRMBA", "B0002WZTOI"]}, "price": 15.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 149633}, "asin": "0790731541", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516l1sshrEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Right Stuff"}

{"description": "The first thing you need to know aboutSleepersis that it's based on a novel by Lorenzo Carcaterra that was allegedly based on a true story. The movie repeats this bogus claim, which was attacked and determined by a wide majority to be misleading. Knowing this,Sleeperscan be a problematic movie because it's too neat, too clean, too manipulative in terms of legal justice and dramatic impact to be truly convincing. And yet, with its stellar cast directed by Barry Levinson, the movie succeeds as gripping entertainment, and its tale of complex morality--despite a dubious emphasis on homophobic revenge--is sufficiently provocative. It's about four boys in New York's Hell's Kitchen district who are sent to reform school, where they must endure routine sexual assaults by the sadistic guards. Years after their release, the opportunity for revenge proves irresistible for two of the young men, who must then rely on the other pair of friends (Brad Pitt, Jason Patric), a loyal priest (Robert De Niro), and a shabby lawyer (Dustin Hoffman) to defend them in court. Despite the compelling ambiguities of the story, there's never any doubt about how we're supposed to feel, and the screenplay glosses over the story's most difficult moral dilemmas. And yet,Sleepersgrabs your attention and pulls you into its intense story of friendship and the price of loyalty under extreme conditions. The movie's New York settings are vividly authentic, and Minnie Driver makes a strong impression as a long-time friend of the loyal group of guys.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003ASLJQS", "B000HT38IK", "B00AEBB8LA", "0345404114", "B000P0J0AG", "B0000DI87S", "B002O3Z4WK", "B00011CZRE", "B000JLQQ94", "B0002DB54A", "0800177789", "B000P0J09M", "B00008DP4C", "B002NZK5VO", "0767802578", "6305313687", "B000P0J0EW", "B000M341QE", "B00004WG2F", "B002NZK5UU", "B0001GF2D8", "0792838076", "B00AEBB9NM", "B00005U14H", "B0006GAOJA", "B000C20VPA", "B00004XPPB", "B0000AMJEK", "B006TTC5HC", "0792846435", "B00005V9HH", "B000P0J0D8", "B00GUO2SKA", "0783233477", "B00049QQHI", "6305310335", "B00008OE4W", "B008R65XYC", "B003ASLJIQ", "B00003CXKA", "B00AEFYMGO", "B0010KP360", "B00003CXWV", "B002VWNICM", "B00B0U2SFE", "B0010DR4BO", "0780618548", "B00004U103", "6304779631", "B00AEBB8SS", "B00AEFXYJA", "B00562D3Y2", "B00007AJE1", "0767810872", "0767836359", "B000244GCW", "B001GD6VTE", "B00003CXIP", "B004SIP7TE", "B000A2UBN4", "B000B8GT92", "B00CCMKPO0", "0783240295", "0783226845", "B000067IZ3", "B00HOGBXS6", "6305263248", "0767830555", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00AEFXT1S", "B0001US7T0", "B0002IQIH4", "B00AEBB9F0", "B004SIP7VM", "B000R4SMCW", "B00AEBB9AK", "B00102F5WK", "B002ZG99N6", "0783222149", "B00AEBB95K", "B00000K0DQ", "B000LP6KNU", "B0051MKN68", "B003LR5BD0", "B0007PID84", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002AT8K9W", "B004EPYZP8", "B00AEBB9UK", "6305065551", "B003UESJHO", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B00AEBBA2W", "B002NZK5R8", "B0001CNRRU", "B0034G4P30", "B00006AUJR", "B00005JA9F", "B000093FLA"], "bought_together": ["B003ASLJQS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002DB54A", "0790741660", "B003ASLJQS", "B000C20VPA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 29942}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.81, "brand": "Warner", "asin": "0790729393", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YH0PHCPTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sleepers"}

There's even a small, but very noticeable, gaffe that somehow made it into the final cut of the film.", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300183513", "6300215741", "0783221347", "6300181340", "6301798503", "6301586026", "0792839846", "0783235593", "0792837096", "6304039530", "0783235607", "6304383177", "6300181472", "0783235682", "6300183580", "0783216084", "B0002IXSVI", "0783235615", "0783235704", "630150528X", "0792837614", "B00005Q4GY", "6300181529", "6302842263", "6304196873", "079284517X", "6301964012", "630233683X", "6301966317", "1558807780", "6300215717", "6304359705", "B00005A1VH", "6304119097", "6300214567", "6303402070", "630228175X", "630347327X", "0782006809", "B000BWIZRW", "6301976932", "6305123616", "6305576173", "6301797957", "6302227127", "6303562248", "6300988473", "B001E419N8", "6302952581", "0782008348", "6301640667", "6302909023", "6301734734", "B0000040EJ", "6303192254", "079283853X", "B00004TYS8", "6300268470", "6304071876", "B00004TRD5", "B0000040EO", "B00004R67T", "6304508557", "6300215865", "6301607929", "6302413435", "0783235623", "6302700949", "0800113055", "0800116917", "0800100832", "6303029027", "B000006N70", "6301800974", "0782006779", "0792107683", "6301965701", "B000005PE7", "6301670140", "6304429274", "630196733X", "0800132009", "630266232X", "6300251152", "B00007JME0", "6300181367", "6304005490", "B000021Y6K", "5559477621", "6304111363", "630442972X", "6300216721", "0783236352", "6301670159", "6301955293", "B000007NPV", "0792837630", "B00004TZS4", "6301706587", "6300268748"], "bought_together": ["6300183513", "6300215741"], "also_viewed": ["0792839846", "6300181340", "6305123616", "0800132009", "0783221347", "6300183513", "6304117752", "630233683X", "6304039522", "0783235593", "6300183580", "6304039530"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 301403}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.54, "brand": "", "asin": "0790743213", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518E4AG3GWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "North by Northwest - Special Edition [VHS]"}

{"description": "Any Given Sunday, Oliver Stone's salute-cum-expos&#xE9; of pro football, belabors some pretty obvious points for nigh onto three hours; but between the frenetic editing, the pounding rap-music beats, and several flashy performances, it's certainly never dull. Al Pacino, coach of the fictional Miami Sharks (the NFL declined involvement in this production), struggles with the most time-honored of sports movie dilemmas: what to do with the old friend who's past his prime and the young hotshot who could save the franchise but first has to learn what being a team player is all about. Comedian Jamie Foxx does a marvelous dramatic turn as the rookie quarterback whose ego and talent are equally impressive, while Pacino seems more at ease in Oliver Stone Land than any actor since regular James Woods (on hand as well as a sleazy team doctor). Prowling the sidelines, shouting spittle-flecked orders, seizing up in almost physical pain when a play goes the wrong way, Pacino is as unashamedly--and entertainingly--hyperbolic as Stone's whirling montages of boiling storm clouds, bloodthirsty fans, and players smashed into the mud. (Once again football, perhaps the most sophisticated of team sports, is viewed cinematically as a bunch of guys hitting each other in slow motion.) Unfortunately, all the self-conscious mythologizing and pumped-up macho posturing that Stone can muster doesn't conceal a clich&eacute;d, slapped-together script, whose few good ideas (mostly about race in America) jostle about with several hoary, terrible ones--including a too-literal analogy of football players as modern gladiators. (To drive the point home, Stone includes Charlton Heston--the agingBen-Hur--in one of many star-powered cameos.) All in all,Any Given Sundayis never dull, but never very enjoyable, either.--Bruce Reid", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305428492", "B00005JNEW", "B002O3Z4XY", "B00AEFYR3C", "B00AEBB9UU", "B000056VP4", "B000J3OTT6", "B00E1HIXFW", "B00005JPBO", "B00AEFXJY0", "B00004W221", "B00AEFXOKO", "B000KHYN9C", "B000EXZFCQ", "B002VWNIEA", "B000GAKDAG", "B00AEFYJI0", "B000FVR1T2", "B001LGXIA6", "630514415X", "B00005JLG1", "B000CBCWRG", "B0001Q4BOE", "B0001US66Y", "630529142X", "B0015OKWL2", "B00006RVJR", "B00003GPFT", "B0000JBUHI", "B002VECM6S", "078324021X", "6305505780", "B00009ZPUA", "B00004TJQJ", "0783226845", "B0000AC8LH", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B000C20VPA", "B00AEFYE08", "0767813901", "B000C20VRS", "B002CA68N4", "B00003CXNG", "B00005JLX2", "B00003W8NT", "B00275EGWY", "0792843592", "6305065551", "B000P0J09M", "B000MNOX94", "B00005N89M", "B00AEFYKWU", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005M20J", "6305428115", "B002NZK5VO", "B0000TG94W", "B003VA3JZY", "B00005JA9F", "B0034G4OSG", "B000CNESTE", "6305310335", "1558908390", "B000PAAJZ6", "B00000JGHV", "B0019L770A", "B004SIP7TE", "B0010YSD8Q", "B001GZ6QC4", "B000MGBSE4", "B00AEFY5B6", "6304765258", "B000F6ZIIS", "B001GKJ2E8", "B0000TWMWK", "B000JYW5BO", "B000BOH8X2", "B00005JKMQ", "B001DJLD1M", "B0041QSZS8", "B002AT8K9W", "B002O3Z50Q", "B009YQJ2Q4", "B000FOPPDI", "B001FB55NK", "B00004Z4WR", "B0045HCJG2", "B000M341QE", "B0029Z8K74", "B000A0GP0Y", "B000065U1N", "6301971345", "B0045HCIXG", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00005JN2Z", "B003PIUIIS", "155890834X", "B00066FAQW", "B000MXPE7O"], "bought_together": ["B00005JNEW", "B000056VP4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00B83N2NU", "B00000JXVK", "B00005JPBO", "B00005JNEW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 56346}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.98, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "0790749912", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5193WdbH-eL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Any Given Sunday"}
{"description": "The world domination of Pok&eacute;mon begets their first theatrical  movie. This adventure is a little more complex and dark than the popular TV series, but kids who live for the show will gobble up this film and ask for seconds. Those baffled by the show's popularity, however, will see nothing better here. Mewtwo, a new type of Pok&eacute;mon designed by scientists to be the ultimate fighter, decides he wants to rule the world and challenges all the great Pok&eacute;masters to battle. Of course, our  intrepid heroes Ash, Misty, and Brock are there to tangle with Mewtwo and spoil his devilish schemes. The film is a tad more emotional than the show (that is, there is some emotion), with Ash sacrificing himself to defend his beloved  Pikachu (but don't you worry, Ash will be just fine).Would you really expect the makers of this worldwide phenomenon to radically change its winning formula?  The feature is only 55&nbsp;minutes long, but there's also a 20-minute short, \"Pikachu's Vacation.\" For the Pok&eacute;mon novice, this escapade will truly baffle: the narrated tale  has virtually no dialogue except Pok&eacute;mon speaking their names (Bulbasaur, for instance, will only express emotion by using variations of his name: \"Bulba, Bulba-SAUR!\"). It's a real curio.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004ZES5", "B00005LKLF", "B00005OW0H", "B0014Z4OOI", "B004YCKJVA", "B0014Z4OOS", "B004AUCDOW", "B000MKXF46", "B000WW1YOM", "B000056BS7", "B000GLL1C4", "B000T28G28", "B005AU4RZY", "B001QWQJ9W", "B00DRTNFEY", "B00G47C54W", "B00007KK1F", "6305209871", "0788805843", "B00FQI1R4Y", "B00000JSI9", "6304401132", "B00000JSIA", "6303314015", "B000035Z2S", "6304089767", "B00002MZ1Y", "B000I0QLF0", "B004SUDQ0E", "B00005LKI1", "B006P0FF3Q", "B00003CXLM", "6305261539", "B000031KJM", "B00B83QHV4", "6305466874", "B004FS00CQ", "B0000BWVAB", "B000021Y6Q", "6305466858", "6304100507", "1560395737", "6304434340", "6305229449", "6305261547", "B0000BWVAC", "B00005JLET", "6305375062", "B004SUDQ2C", "6305375100", "B004P7CMSM", "155890641X", "6305745226", "B000059MQE", "B006ZL1P34", "6304500831", "078881172X", "B00003OTI3", "6305745269", "B0000A14T9", "B00007KK1E", "6302178924", "6305844666", "B000021Y6O", "B00005JKDQ", "B00004TJGW", "6303534422", "B003T2K9TI", "B0002M5U06", "0780607287", "0790732475", "0788812807", "B00AYBVB44", "B00000IYER", "B000RQ5UC0", "9628597256", "0788802194", "6303675220", "B00061QJ8K", "B00003G1FK", "B001LHSAPI", "B0000AQZYM", "B000058BCU", "B00007M5IZ", "B00AE406WO", "6302526574", "6301948106", "6304140762", "B00004STAN", "B00005MM9T", "B00BCMSZ7K", "0439154049", "B000046S41", "B004DMIISC", "B008L5FFMO", "B00006JUDM", "0788803743", "6300274268"], "bought_together": ["B00004ZES5", "B00005LKLF"], "also_viewed": ["B00004ZES5", "B006ZL1P34", "B001RPZE44", "B00003CXLM", "B00005OW0H", "6305209871", "B00005LKI1", "B00FAOCFL8", "B00005LKLF", "B000GLL1C4", "B0014Z4OOS", "6303314015", "0788812408", "B004YCKJVA", "B004AUCDOW", "B00G47C54W", "0788805843", "B00FQI1R4Y", "B001QWQJ9W", "B00DRTNFEY", "B000WW1YOM", "B0000AQZYM", "B004SUDQ2C", "B00005OW0I", "B0014Z4OOI", "B0000BWVAB", "6305261539", "B000MKXF46", "B00005JKDQ", "6304401132", "0788806270", "6302526574", "B006P0FF3Q", "B000035Z2S", "6302787068", "6305310068", "155890641X", "B00002MZ1Y", "6304089767", "6303534422", "B00B83QHV4", "B000JV3GKQ", "0788802194", "6305940932", "6301792734", "6304500831", "0439137411", "6302642248", "B00007KK1F", "6305375100", "6303036813", "B00BWW7JNQ", "B000NNK4SC", "B004SUDQ0E", "B000I0QLF0", "B005AU4RZY", "B00000JYUR"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 106095}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.6, "brand": "Warner Bros.

{"description": "Black comedy and suspenseful action inside a German POW camp during World War II--a setting that was later borrowed for the TV sitcomHogan's Heroes. The great director Billy Wilder adapted the hit stage play, applying his own wicked sense of humor to the apparently bleak subject matter. William Holden plays an antisocial grouse amid a gang of wisecracking though indomitable American prisoners. Because of his bitter cynicism, Holden is suspected by the others of being an informer to the Germans, an accusation he must deal with in his own crafty way. Holden, who had delivered a brilliant performance for Wilder inSunset Boulevard, won the 1953 Best Actor Oscar forStalag 17. Very much his equal, however, is Otto Preminger, an accomplished director himself, who plays the strict, sneering camp commandant.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["079284517X", "B00005Q4GY", "B00000F13T", "B0009QAT6U", "0783222955", "6303168507", "6302909023", "6301973240", "6302682606", "6304071876", "6300181472", "6305110859", "1558807780", "6304196954", "6301977297", "6302529484", "0790752395", "6300251012", "6302529441", "6303686745", "6300246965", "630150528X", "6300246868", "0800132009", "0800116917", "B0000048YO", "6302224489", "6302952581", "6301798732", "6304111398", "0783217528", "6301797906", "6301959728", "6300213676", "0790732017"], "bought_together": ["B00005Q4GY", "B00000F13T"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 315192}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0792108280", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71NMB5C9AZL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Stalag 17 [VHS]"}

Make that four amazing performances, because inPrimal Fearhe plays a young man named Aaron Stampler whose personality seems to be divided in two: one tough and cynical, the other shy and fearful. Richard Gere plays Martin Vail, the slick Chicago attorney who defends Aaron on charges of brutally murdering an archbishop who may have sexually molested Aaron and other boys in his parish. The courtroom suspense is nail-biting as the jaded hotshot Vail comes to care about the case and the defendant.

{"description": "Welcome to Delos, the high-tech Disneyland for adults that Michael Crichton created forWestworld, a nifty science fiction thriller from 1973 that also marked the popular novelist's feature-film directorial debut. The movie is so named because the vacationing buddies who travel to Delos (James Brolin, Richard Benjamin) choose Westworld as their destination (the other choices being Roman World and Medieval World), where they are free to indulge their movie-inspired fantasies of the Wild West.  From brothel beauties to black-hatted gunslingers (like the villain played by Yul Brynner), the place is populated by perfectly humanlike robots programmed and monitored to cater to every guest's fancy. But fun turns into abject horror when the robots--particularly Brynner's badman--begin to malfunction and Delos turns into an amusement park that's anything but amusing.Westworldhas moments of camp and the look of a low-budget backlot production, but two decades before Crichton revamped his idea to createJurassic Park, this movie made the most of its interesting and exciting premise.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300181987", "6303471552", "6300213676", "6301977742", "6300213838", "6301971582", "6300147630", "0790731975", "6302890721", "6300271781", "0784011923", "6301977815", "630442972X", "6301327845", "0790733897", "6300181537", "B000007PI4", "6301968948", "6301971426", "0792846311", "6300183084", "6300181472", "6300181464", "6302814723", "0792845684", "0790733927", "6302182522"], "bought_together": ["6303471552"], "also_viewed": ["6302969352", "6303471552"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 375477}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.98, "brand": "", "asin": "0792835077", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B90XC72EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Westworld [VHS]"}

{"description": "If you can stifle the urge to laugh at its pastel unisex costumes and futuristic shopping-mall d&eacute;cor, this extravagant science fiction film from 1976 is still visually fascinating and provocatively entertaining. Set in the year 2274, when ecological disaster has driven civilization to the protection of domed cities, the story revolves around a society that holds a ceremonial death ritual for all citizens who reach the age of 30. In a diseaseless city where free sex is encouraged and old age is virtually unknown, Logan (Michael York) is a \"sandman,\" one who enforces this radical method of population control (but he's about to turn 30 and he doesn't want to die). Escaping from the domed city via a network of underground passages, Logan is joined by another \"runner\" named Jessica (Jenny Agutter), while his former sandman partner (Richard Jordan) is determined to terminate Logan's rebellion.

{"description": "Based on Thomas Harris's novel, this terrifying film by Jonathan Demme really only contains a couple of genuinely shocking moments (one involving an autopsy, the other a prison break). The rest of the film is a splatter-free visual and psychological descent into the hell of madness, redeemed astonishingly by an unlikely connection between a monster and a haunted young woman. Anthony Hopkins is extraordinary as the cannibalistic psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter, virtually entombed in a subterranean prison for the criminally insane. At the behest of the FBI, agent-in-training Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) approaches Lecter, requesting his insights into the identity and methods of a serial killer named Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine). In exchange, Lecter demands the right to penetrate Starling's most painful memories, creating a bizarre but palpable intimacy that liberates them both under separate but equally horrific circumstances. Demme, a filmmaker with a uniquely populist vision (Melvin and Howard,Something Wild), also spent his early years making pulp for Roger Corman (Caged Heat), and he hasn't forgotten the significance of tone, atmosphere, and the unsettling nature of a crudely effective close-up. Much of the film, in fact, consists of actors staring straight into the camera (usually from Clarice's point of view), making every bridge between one set of eyes to another seem terribly dangerous.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005LKIM", "6302054982", "B00008AOS5", "B00005PJ8I", "B000007OY0", "6302800420", "0790705141", "B00003CXE6", "6301179552", "6301427076", "B000003KHS", "6300989003", "6303402348", "B0000633ZP", "B00005ATQA"], "bought_together": ["6302054982"], "also_viewed": ["6305363668", "6302415853", "0792116887", "079213690X", "0800103106", "6305750750"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 331980}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0792842111", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4117Q86BS0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Silence of the Lambs [VHS]"}
{"description": "George A. Romero monkeys with nature in this gripping and fearful tale based on the novel by Michael Stewart. Allan Mann (John Beghe) is a law student who's hit by a truck while jogging, leaving him a quadriplegic. Luckily, his scientist friend Geoffrey (John Pankow) is experimenting with capuchin monkeys, making them smarter with injections of human genetic material. Geoffrey arranges with Melanie (Kate McNeil)--who's working on an experimental program that matches monkeys with paraplegics to perform guide-dog functions--to train his prize subject, Ella (Boo), to act as Allan's helper. Allan is paralyzed from the neck down, confined to a wheelchair he moves by working a lever with his mouth. He's really vulnerable. Ella can fetch things and do errands, and a real emotional bond develops between Mann and monkey. Too strong a bond, it turns out, as Allan begins to experience dreams from the monkey's-eye view (capuchin-cam), Ella's boosted intelligence giving her the residual benefit of a telepathic ability in which the monkey begins to act out Allan's subconscious rage. Allan's nurse, former girlfriend, doctor, even his mother are terrorized by the creepy capuchin, leading to a showdown between Ella and Allan himself. With Allan trapped in a house, alone with a super-intelligent and malevolent monkey, there is plenty of suspense to make you rip holes in your upholstery. But perhaps even more tension could have been wrung out of this story if Ella had been more sympathetic (being as she was the victim of a scientific experiment gone bad), her wicked antics the acts of a kind of exterminating angel. Performances are brilliant by both Ella and Jason Beghe, who turns in one of cinema's most accurate and intelligent depictions of a high-level quadriplegic character.--Jim Gay", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305213305", "B0004Z33E6", "B007XF0W3K", "B00EU8RC1S", "B00005K3NZ", "B00JJOY47I", "B00005O5B5", "0792841328", "B002GHHHG0", "B00C7E3EIM", "B005ZHBEPI", "B0002C4JJ4", "B00D7AM71A", "6305622760", "B0053TWW9K", "B003PIUINI", "B00008WJDA", "B000067FP4", "B008CYDD7I", "B0053TWV46", "B00DOZNGTK", "B0000C3I99", "B00005Y1UV", "0767802497", "B000TUDBFM", "B00004TS0G", "B00E5S2HGS", "B00IA1VKVY", "B003JIPN20", "B00EF0NY7W", "B001992NW4", "B00005NQGM", "B00BTYRB2G", "B00JQYV0B4", "B009IV2Z3M", "B00004Z1GI", "B00013RC7K", "B00JU94ZPS", "B000RW3VCK", "B00009NHBH", "B001GCUO0W", "B00009PY2T", "B003TRMLQM", "B002AMVEII", "B000FFJZO2", "B0002KQNL8", "6304936397", "B0016MJ6P6", "B00AEBB91O", "B0009X75J2", "B004EI2NP4", "B0001611DI", "B001B1UO6W", "B00005N5RM", "B00009PY43", "B003NEQ74S", "B00008G8M5", "B005CVFZ66", "B00A429Y56", "B00EL6ADQ0", "B002I41KNC", "B0002C9DK4", "B000UR9QIK", "B000A7Q1UQ", "B00003CWU3", "B000RXVNCO", "B00GJ7CUFG", "B005ZHBDTK", "B00008WJEY", "B00000K3TO", "B00049QJBG", "B0015NORDW", "B00AKGG828", "B003ELKNH2", "B00A50PDS4", "B00DTPRZ10", "B00013RC8E", "B0043X1FNQ", "6304936532", "B001B8XRT6", "B000099T3U", "B00C7A8WZQ", "B0009X76XC", "B000068IEX", "B008DVJOQ4", "B000F3UA8E", "B000CR76U8", "B00006FDBT", "B0000AZT78", "0792846885", "B003L1YESE", "B000065OWC", "B000TUDBFW", "157347049X", "B000T28POC", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B0045HCJG2", "B0008191WO", "B0002V7O3I"], "bought_together": ["6305213305"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DFNEN0C", "B0001611DI", "B008CYDD7I", "B002GHHHG0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 124531}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 59.99, "brand": "TCFHE/MGM", "asin": "0792841336", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71YMGC6056L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Monkey Shines"}

The story of up-and-coming DJ Kenny (Guy Davis) and his relationship with jazz musician Tracy (Rae Dawn Chong) may only be a device, but it's surprisingly effective, as is the ultimately tragic tale of graffiti artist Ramon (Jon Chardiet).

{"description": "FutureNightmarecreator andScreamweaver Wes Craven's  film debut is a primitive little production that rises above its cut-rate  production values and hazy, grainy patina via its grimly affecting portrait  of human evil infiltrating a middle-class household. The story is adapted  from Ingmar Bergman'sThe Virgin Spring, but the film has more in  common with Sam Peckinpah'sStraw Dogsas it charts the descent of a  harmless married couple into methodical killers. A quartet of criminals--a  distorted version of the nuclear family--kidnaps a pair of teenage girls and  proceeds to ravage, rape, torture, and finally brutally murder them in the  woods, unwittingly within walking distance of their rural home. The killers  take refuge in the girls' own home, but when the parents discover just who  they are and what they've done, they plot violent retribution.Along with George Romero'sNight of the Living Deadand Tobe Hooper'sTexas Chainsaw Massacre, Craven helped redefine American horror with  this debut--all three movies portray modern society crumbling into madness  and horror. But, unlike his fellow directors, Craven gives his film an  uncomfortable verisimilitude, setting it squarely in the heartland of modern  America. While at times it's awkward and inconsistent, with distracting comic  interludes, his handling of the brutal horror scenes is unsettling, and the  death of the daughter is an unexpectedly quiet and lyrical moment.--Sean  Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792839242", "6302921058", "B00000K0DU", "6300214311", "6300182770", "B00000IQUT"], "also_viewed": ["6302921058"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 475308}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.78, "brand": "", "asin": "079284632X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512ZWA7XGZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Last House on the Left [VHS]"}

{"description": "Thirteen-year-old Jenna (Shana Dowdeswell) has had enough with the trials of adolescence. In addition to being saddled with a devoted-but-nerdy best friend, Matt (Sean Marquette), she falls victim to one of the dangers of playing Seven Minutes in Heaven with the coolest kids in school: being stranded without a willing make-out partner. Humiliated, Jenna buries herself in the aforementioned make-out closet, wishing she could skip the whole adolescence bit and move straight into adulthood, and miraculously wakes up just weeks away from her 30th birthday. Of course, a lot has changed since going to bed the night before, not the least of which being an impressive set of womanly curves. The new, older Jenna (Jennifer Garner) is a successful magazine editor with friends in high places and a lion's share of potential suitors -- including a hockey-playing boyfriend and a swarthy married man. The problem is that her mind hasn't matured with her body; Jenna not only finds living on her own more terrifying than cool, but is quick to dismiss any male over the age of 14 as \"gross.\" Half excited, half mortified, Jenna seeks out Matt (Mark Ruffalo), whom she learns she had spurned as a teenager in an effort to join the popular crowd.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006ZXSL", "B00AKGG6JS", "B00005O5CM", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B0015I2RT8", "B001OQCUYI", "B00005JMCW", "B001OQCUZM", "B00003CXSM", "B000J103OI", "B00AEFYM2S", "B002K0WBXW", "B00AEBB8R4", "B000EMGICS", "B004SIP9X8", "B003LSFM6U", "B0000897EG", "B000ELJAEM", "B00AEFY99O", "1401324142", "6304765266", "1416205152", "B00GO37I8Y", "0809229374", "B0001XAR1I", "B0001Z3TXE", "B00005JM55", "B00AEFYWQY", "B00007E2F5", "B0002VYOVI", "B00KS9V6EC", "B000J4QW7W", "B000YDBPAM", "B0007PLLBU", "B001TUZD8O", "B002ZG988M", "B0009OL7Z4", "B004SIP9RO", "B0000ZMGWK", "1400050138", "B0000DZ6N3", "B00AQS803A", "6302077818", "B00006ZXSK", "B00005JN0Z", "B000YAA68C", "B0007LXPBI", "B00E4Z7FQY", "B002P413IC", "B001ASQ9OM", "B006YTGL86", "B00795C5X4", "B00063KGPU", "B000BVM1S2", "B000209KMW", "B000A343RI", "B00062IVN0", "B000P0J0DS", "B00002SSKI", "6305428425", "B003TY2SWC", "B0051GLDVS", "B00008K7AM", "B0071HPOGK", "B0000AKCJK", "B000023VTP", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00006FMUW", "B002XTXG8O", "B00AMEZDJW", "B001AEF6BS", "B00447L4KA", "B000MQC9H4", "6305428042", "B002GOAH1U", "B0036TGSIK", "B002A5EBMQ", "B0000AOV4I", "B001C5LLQ4", "B000324Y98", "B00005JG6N", "6305236569", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B004EPZ070", "B003L20ICE", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00AEBBA2M", "B00005JN3W", "B0075RREYG", "B000F2BNW2", "0783235070", "B0021L8UO4", "0800177258", "B002SYAGNC", "B000HT386M", "B0007P0Y7C", "B000QUU4LY", "B00006ZXSN", "B00AEBB9WI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0013D8LFY", "B002K0WBXW", "B00AKGG6JS", "B001OQCUZM"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 461629}, "asin": "1404918051", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EO6%2BQ3jvL.jpg", "title": "13 Going on 30: Fun &amp; Flirty Edition"}

{"description": "Overview\nFormer vice president Al Gore shares his concerns on the pressing issue of global warming in this documentary. A long-time environmental activist, Gore first became aware of evidence on global warming in the 1970s, and since leaving public office he has become a passionate advocate for large- and small-scale changes in our laws and lifestyles that could help alleviate this crisis. An Inconvenient Truth records a multi-media presentation hosted by Gore in which he discusses the scientific facts behind global warming, explains how it has already begun to affect our environment, talks about the disastrous consequences if the world's governments and citizens do not act, and shares what each individual can do to help protect the Earth for this and future generations.

{"description": "On the strength of his Hitchcockian-thriller debut,Mute Witness, writer-director Anthony Waller was hired to direct this belated sequel to the 1981 horror comedyAn American Werewolf in London, but lycanthropy in the City of Light just ain't what it used to be. The movie offers plenty of gruesome makeup and special wolf-transformation effects, and there are some effectively spooky moments in the plot involving an underground population of hungry Parisian werewolves. One of them is seductively played by Julie Delpy, who is rescued from attempted suicide by an American tourist (Tom Everett Scott, fromThat Thing You Do!) but ultimately can't hide her dual identity when darkness falls and the full moon shines. The movie begins well, but gradually succumbs to nonsense and mayhem, prompting critic Roger Ebert to observe that &quot;here are people we don't care about, doing things they don't understand, in a movie without any rules.&quot; In other words, you'd have to be a die-hard horror buff to give this one the benefit of the doubt.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0024FADD8", "B002HWUU9U", "B004P7CN3G", "B000A2X3U2", "0800177029", "B003WTO5NO", "B001AR0D5Y", "B0002I84DK", "B000U1ZV7Q", "B000RW5BZ0", "B0001EFV7M", "B000P0J056", "B00AEBB91E", "B001GCUO0W", "B005CA4SEC", "6305258287", "B00023BM4S", "B000Q66Q56", "B00KM5F31O", "B004P7CN7W", "B00AEFYV9W", "B00441GYVA", "B00005LC4O", "B005CFBZWK", "B00L4K3MLE", "B00009OWI1", "B00AEBB9AA", "B000AM6OQ2", "B002DKGWUC", "0767817664", "B005TG8156", "B000OCY7TY", "B00JJOY496", "B00HRCBGRA", "B004SUDQCW", "B000000OL8", "B00005UQ9W", "0783232039", "B00AEBBA72", "B0002DB54A", "B000IJ79TS", "B008OR5X4O", "B000GI3RGK", "B00005O439", "B00008AOVO", "B0001Z37HM", "B00IKM5LXG", "B003EYVXSW", "B00005NB8U", "B003I7BXM6", "0767824954", "B00JF5GAZA", "B00K6D1HSK", "B001B1UO6W", "B00AEBBA2W", "0780619951", "B00FQPLZ08", "B00JHH1VSW", "B00006FDBT", "B00006FD9N", "B0002KVUKM", "B00070FX5U", "B0000E2R6P", "B009IV2Z3M", "6305308810", "B00IJS2OXG", "B000TGJ80S", "B0002CHK1S", "B0053TWW1I", "B00018D3UU", "B0002KQNL8", "B000A5045Q", "6305588236", "B000099T3U", "B004AC6PMG", "B00D9EJG54", "B002LMSWN2", "B000TUDBFM", "B0053TWVA0", "1573628174", "B00003CWRF", "B000MV8AC2", "B005CFBZ8O", "B000TLTCR2", "B00IYJRIKO", "B00008LUNW", "B000GBEWRU", "B00A1AU72A", "B0002S9QT6", "B00E56GB12", "B001ECDVKE", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000HC2M0C", "B008OR5X6W", "B002NZK5U0", "B000VSDNFA", "B000069HZO", "B006ZGROB6", "B000BTIU4S", "B00006CXGP"], "bought_together": ["B0024FADD8", "B00AEBB91E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0024FADD8", "B00009OWI1", "B001GCUO0W", "B000RW5BZ0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15595}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.69, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "155890848X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZTANHEYML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "An American Werewolf in Paris"}

Set at an upper-crust seaside resort, the 1971 film recounts Bathory's plot to replace her current consort (Andrea Rau) with a fresher specimen, an abused newlywed whose brutal young husband is an inconvenience waiting to be eliminated. Although both the bi-sex and the neck-biting violence are tame by today's standards, the film has a graceful, gliding sense of pace that gets under your skin; something unspeakably kinky always seems to be just about to happen.

{"description": "Alain Delon is the coolest killer to hit the screen, a film noir loner for the modern era, in Jean-Pierre Melville's austere 1967 French crime classic. Delon's impassive hit man, Jef Costello, is the ultimate professional in an alienated world of glass and metal. On his latest contract, however, he lets a witness live--a charming jazz pianist, Valerie (Cathy Rosier), who neglects to identify him in the police lineup. When Costello survives an assassination attempt by his employers, he carefully plots his next moves as cops and criminals close in and he prepares for one last job. Melville meticulously details every move by Costello and the police in fascinating wordless sequences, from Costello's preparations for his first hit to the cops' exhaustive efforts to tail Jef as he lines up his last; and his measured pace creates an otherworldly ambiance, an uneasy calm on the verge of shattering. Costello remains a cipher, a zen killer whose fa&ccedil;ade begins to crack as the world seems to be collapsing in on him, exposing the wound-up psyche hidden behind his blank face. Melville rethinks film noir in modern terms, as an existential crime drama in soft, somber color and sleek images (courtesy of cinematographer extraordinaire Henri Deca&euml;).Le Samoura&iuml;inspired two pseudo-remakes, Walter Hill'sDriverand John Woo'sKiller, but neither film comes close to the compelling austerity and meticulous detail of Melville's cult masterpiece.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302797683"]}, "price": 15.5, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 469788}, "asin": "1567301347", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AF1DKN13L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Le Samourai [VHS]"}
{"description": "Outside of devoted cult audiences, many Americans have yet to discover the extremely stylish, relentlessly terrifying Italian horror genre, or the films of its talented virtuoso, Dario Argento.Suspiria, part one of a still-uncompleted trilogy (the luminously emptyInfernowas the second), is considered his masterpiece by Argento devotees but also doubles as a perfect starting point for those unfamiliar with the director or his genre. The convoluted plot follows an American dancer (Jessica Harper) from her arrival at a European ballet school to her discovery that it's actually a witches coven; but, really, don't worry about that too much. Argento makes narrative subservient to technique, preferring instead to assault the senses and nervous system with mood, atmosphere, illusory gore, garish set production, a menacing camera, and perhaps the creepiest score ever created for a movie. It's essentially a series of effectively unsettling set pieces--a raging storm that Harper should have taken for an omen, and a blind man attacked by his own dog are just two examples--strung together on a skeleton structure.

Though the duchess is gone, the eponymous freak remains, now fully grown.  As the family moves into the castle to await its sale, internal conflicts concerning Reilly's guilt over the blinding of the daughter, and the blame from his wife, further fracture their unstable family unit.  Castle Freak escapes his shackles in search of food, and more importantly human warmth.  The Freak just doesn't know how to express his need for love in a socially acceptable way, however, and seems destined for an unsavory end at the hands of the something-to-prove Reilly, who must find some way to route to vicious creature.

{"description": "When Universal Pictures picked up the movie rights to a Broadway adaptation ofDracula, they felt secure in handing the property over to the sinister team of actor Lon Chaney and director Tod Browning. But Chaney died of cancer, and Universal hired the Hungarian who had scored a success in the stage play: B&eacute;la Lugosi. The resulting film launched both Lugosi's baroque career and the horror-movie cycle of the 1930s. It gets off to an atmospheric start, as we meet Count Dracula in his shadowy castle in Transylvania, superbly captured by the great cinematographer Karl Freund. Eventually Dracula and his blood-sucking devotee (Dwight Frye, in one of the cinema's truly mad performances) meet their match in a vampire-hunter called Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan). If the later sections of the film are undeniably stage bound and a tad creaky, Dracula nevertheless casts a spell, thanks to Lugosi's creepily lugubrious manner and the eerie silences of Browning's directing style. (After a mood-enhancing snippet ofSwan Lakeunder the opening titles, there is no music in the film.)Frankenstein, which was released a few months later, confirmed the horror craze, and Universal has been making money (and countless spin-off projects) from its twin titans of terror ever since. Certainly the role left a lasting impression on the increasingly addled and drug-addicted Lugosi, who was never quite able to distance himself from the part that made him a star. He was buried, at his request, in his black vampire cape.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300183084", "6300181286", "6300183092", "6300183629", "6302120101", "630252542X", "6302843219", "6300185443", "6302526167", "6301005783", "6301257014", "6302841771", "6302526175", "6303257801", "6302841763", "6302843227", "6300185281", "6300181820", "630284178X", "0783235607", "6302526191", "6302526140", "6302841844", "6300181340", "6301967410", "0783222955", "6302526086", "630018529X", "6304507348", "6302526051", "B00007JME0", "0783240961", "B00AEBB8VK", "630252587X", "6302526094", "6300247589", "B002VWNIAY", "6303626424", "6302843200", "6305576173", "630266232X", "6301327845", "6300215539", "6303402070", "6300182983", "6302309751", "5554306004", "6302841798", "0790705141", "630214227X", "630281474X"], "bought_together": ["6300181286", "6300183092"], "also_viewed": ["6300181286", "6300183629", "6300183092", "6300183084", "6302526175", "6300185281", "6302843219", "630252542X", "6302526140", "6302120101", "B00L8QP0VY", "6302843197", "630018529X", "6302526086", "6302841763", "630252587X", "6302841771", "6302526167", "6300185443", "B00000JMOF", "B00000K14A", "630312917X", "6302843200", "6300214087", "B0001HAGTM", "B008FL8OTK", "B000WNHTCC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 228201}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6300181278", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51588FFRK0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dracula [VHS]"}

{"description": "Widely considered the best movie in the \"classicTrek\" series of feature films,Star Trek IVreturns to one of the favorite themes of the original TV series--time travel--to bring Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty, Sulu, Uhura, and Chekov from the 23rd century to present-day San Francisco. In their own time, the Starfleet heroes encounter an alien probe emitting a mysterious message--a message delivered in the song of the now-extinct Earth species of humpback whales. Failure to respond to the probe will result in Earth's destruction, so Kirk and company time-travel to 20th-century Earth--in their captured Klingon starship--to transport a humpback whale to the future in an effort to peacefully communicate with the alien probe. The plot sounds somewhat absurd in description, but as executed by returning director Leonard Nimoy, this turned out to be a crowd-pleasing adventure, filled with humor and lively interaction among the favorite Star Trek characters. Catherine Hicks (from TV's7th Heaven) plays the 20th-century whale expert who is finally convinced of Kirk's and Spock's benevolent intentions. With ample comedy taken from the clash of future heroes with 20th-century urban realities,Star Trek IVwas a box-office smash, satisfying mainstream audiences and hardcoreTrekfans alike.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303202004", "6300213803", "6301543408", "6300216802", "6300214400", "6304415346", "B00008OSD3", "6303909949", "6305587159"], "bought_together": ["6303202004", "6300213803"], "also_viewed": ["6300214400", "6300213803", "6301543408", "6303202004", "6300216802", "6304415346", "0800103106", "B00004U8P4", "6300214540", "630273486X", "630339406X", "6302877881", "B00BAXTYIA", "B00000ILBK", "6304539274", "B00DB97LCM", "B001TH16DI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 116860}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.98, "brand": "", "asin": "630021463X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G68FMQNQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek IV - The Voyage Home [VHS]"}

The humor may be low and obvious at times, but the jokes keep coming at a rapid-fire clip and its targets--primarily the lesser lights of '70s cinema, from disco films to star-studded disaster epics--are more than worthy for send-up.

The jokes gleefully skirt the boundaries of bad taste (pilot Peter Graves to a juvenile cockpit visitor: \"Joey, have you ever seen a grown man naked?\"), with the high (low?) point being Hagerty's intimate involvement with the blow-up automatic pilot doll, but they'll have you rolling on the floor. The film launched the careers of collaborators Jim Abrahams (Big Business), David Zucker (Ruthless People), and Jerry Zucker (Ghost), as well as revitalized such B-movie actors as Lloyd Bridges, Peter Graves, Robert Stack, and Leslie Nielsen, who built a second career on films like this.

Featuring a classic torture sequence and a terrific cast that includes William Devane and Marthe Keller, this film written by William Goldman (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,All the President's Men) stands as a great entertainment and as one of the seminal films of the 1970s.--Robert Lane", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000003NDB", "6304429274", "B00005K3NV", "6300216748", "0790743159", "6305082448", "B00005ATQA"], "bought_together": ["B000003NDB"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 320462}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6300216713", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71K166ZWM1L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Marathon Man [VHS]"}
{"description": "Jerry Lewis's 1963  Jekyll and Hyde variation has always been tagged by two popular assumptions: one is that it is his best work as a comic filmmaker, and the other is that Lewis's Mr. Hyde equivalent--the slick, ultra-arrogant, good-looking womanizer Buddy Love--actually lampoons the director's former partner, Dean Martin. Well,The Nutty Professorcertainly is Lewis's best film. But all one has to do is watch it to realize the motivation behind Buddy Love is more confessional: he's really much more like Lewis's darker, narcissistic side, while the shlubby scientist (also played by Lewis) from whom Love springs is closer to the star's screen image. You can watch all this psychodrama yourself and have a lot of good laughs at the same time with this unusual film, which still surpasses Eddie Murphy's recent remake--though not necessarily by a wide gap.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000039I3", "6302287375", "630315851X", "B00004UFSO", "6304675143", "6300216233", "6304500718", "6302872669", "6302091632"], "bought_together": ["6302287375"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 299028}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6300215989", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ESQAWW3XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Nutty Professor [VHS]"}

{"description": "Back when the  firstStar Trekfeature was released in December 1979, theTrekfranchise was still relatively modest, consisting of the original TV series, an animated cartoon series from 1973-74, and a burgeoning fan network around the world. Series creator Gene Roddenberry had conceived a second TV series, but after the success ofStar Warsthe project was upgraded into this lavish feature film, which reunited the original series cast aboard a beautifully redesigned starship U.S.S.Enterprise. Under the direction of Robert Wise (best known forWest Side Story), the film proved to be a mixed blessing forTrekfans, who heatedly debated its merits; but it was, of course, a phenomenal hit. Capt. Kirk (William Shatner) leads his crew into the vast structures surrounding V'Ger, an all-powerful being that is cutting a destructive course through Starfleet space. With his new First Officer (Stephen Collins), the bald and beautiful Lieutenant Ilia (played by the late Persis Khambatta) and his returning veteran crew, Kirk must decipher the secret of V'Ger's true purpose and restore the safety of the galaxy. The story is rather overblown and derivative of plots from the original series, and avid Trekkies greeted the film's bland costumes with derisive laughter. But as a feast for the eyes, this is an adventure worthy of big-screen trekkin'. Douglas Trumbull's visual effects are astonishing, and Jerry Goldmith's score is regarded as one of the prolific composer's very best (with its main theme later used forStar Trek: The Next Generation). And, fortunately forStar Trekfans, the expanded 143-minute version (originally shown for the film's network TV premiere) is generally considered an improvement over the original theatrical release.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300214400", "6300213803", "6301543408", "6303202004", "630021463X", "6303909949", "B0000AUHOH", "B00008OSD3", "6301792734", "6305587159", "6300182304", "B0000A36J1", "B000065U6Q", "6304415346", "6305365121", "630336568X", "0671830880", "6300214060", "6304935811", "6302380588", "6303651488"], "bought_together": ["6300213803", "6300214400"], "also_viewed": ["6300213803", "6301543408", "B00DB97LRC", "6300214400", "630021463X", "B00BAXTYIA", "B00005JLRT", "6303202004", "B00DB97LCM", "B00000ILBK", "B002I9Z8DK", "B0000AUHOH", "B002I9Z8B2", "6304415346", "6304539258", "B000USUA8Y", "B002I9Z8CG", "B0095XPZBC", "B002I9Z8GW", "B001TH16DI", "B0083TUEHY", "B00HETWFVC", "630273486X", "B000HEWEJ4", "6303909949", "6300213668"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 278050}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.79, "brand": "", "asin": "6300216802", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4164CYFHC6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek - The Motion Picture [VHS]"}

{"description": "In retrospect, George Seaton's adaptation ofThe Country Girlseems like the movie that was made to prove that both Bing Crosby and Grace Kelly couldact. The tale of an alcoholic actor and singer (Crosby) and his long-suffering wife (Kelly) whose marriage is put to the test when he gets a second chance at stardom, Clifford Odets' drama is chock full of twists and turns designed to give actors a grueling workout, with its hidden secrets, tortured love story, and frank depiction of the horrors of alcohol abuse. Crosby and Kelly sank their teeth into the meaty roles with gusto (it helped that a rock-solid William Holden was there for each to spark off of), and both were showered with accolades that remained high points of their careers. Crosby was lauded with kudos for turning his charming persona inside-out, but it was Kelly who stole the show, possibly because at the time she was one of the hardest working women in show business. In 1954, the actress appeared in four films, including the Alfred Hitchcock classicsDial M for MurderandRear Window, and finally ascended to leading-lady status after her stellar supporting turns inHigh NoonandMogambo. In typical Hollywood fashion, though, it was only when Kelly shrouded her breathtaking beauty in plain clothes and a dowdy hairdo that she was taken seriously and awarded a Best Actress Oscar--one of the most highly contested ever, as she beat out comeback star Judy Garland's ferocious performance inA Star Is Born.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792837649", "B000003KE0", "0792839846", "6300215695", "6300215741", "0782008348", "0792110269", "6301586026"], "bought_together": ["0792837649"], "also_viewed": ["630197879X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 408172}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6300215660", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4120G3A9TKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Country Girl [VHS]"}

A singer who has attracted the attention of a young rodeo rider (Don Murray) whom she meets on a bus, she finds herself trapped at a bus stop in the middle of nowhere during a blizzard. The young cowboy, whose intentions are honorable, can't control his temper and can't understand why this experienced woman won't take him seriously--and why she rejects him when he begins acting jealous and possessive.

{"description": "A Disney \"classic\" that actually is a classic,Dumboshould be part of your video collection whether or not you have children. The storytelling was never as lean as inDumbo, the songs rarely as haunting (or just plain weird), the characters rarely so well defined. The film pits the \"cold, cruel, heartless\" world that can't accept abnormality against a plucky, and mute, hero. Jumbo Jr. (Dumbo is a mean-spirited nickname) is ostracized from the circus pack shortly after his delivery by the stork because of his big ears. His mother sticks up for him and is shackled. He's jeered by children (an insightful scene has one boy poking fun at Dumbo's ears, even though the youngster's ears are also ungainly), used by the circus folk, and demoted to appearing with the clowns.

{"description": "In these days when the natural wonders of the world can be so easily synthesized on film by computers, it's a little tough to look upon studio sets of mountain exteriors as anything but unsatisfactory. But that's the situation with Edward Dmytryk's 1956 dramaThe Mountain, starring Spencer Tracy as a retired mountain guide who accompanies his brash young brother (Robert Wagner) on the ascent of a rugged slope to the site of a plane crash. Essentially, Tracy goes along to keep his venal sibling from getting killed, but once at the crash location his attention shifts toward helping a Hindu survivor (Anna Kashfi) reach safety. Not so the agenda of Wagner's character, whose real mission is looting valuables from the dead. The strains and dangers of the climb up and down perfectly mirror the tense dynamics between the two men, and on this score Dmytryk (The Caine Mutiny) does a splendid job. Less compelling, however, is the action, which requires far too much suspension of disbelief even for the late '50s.--Tom Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 268474}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 17.95, "brand": "", "asin": "630110594X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KY0T41FHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Mountain [VHS]"}

{"description": "Meticulously crafted but also ponderous and predictable, James Cameron's 1989 deep-sea close-encounter epic reaffirms one of the oldest first principles of cinema: everything moves a lot more slowly underwater. Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, as formerly married petroleum engineers who still have some \"issues\" to work out, are drafted to assist a gung-ho Navy SEAL (Michael Biehn) with a top-secret recovery operation: a nuclear sub has been ambushed and sunk, under mysterious circumstances, in some of the deepest waters on earth, and the petro-techies have the only submersible craft capable of diving down that far. Every image and every performance is painstakingly sharp and detailed (and the computerized water creatures are lovely) but the movie's lumbering pace is ultimately lethal. It's the audience that ends up feeling waterlogged. For a guy who likes guns as much as Cameron (his next film after all, was the body-count masterpieceTerminator&nbsp;2: Judgment Day), it's interesting that the moral balance here is weighted heavily in favor of the can-do engineers; the military types are end-justifies-the-means amoralists, just like the weasely government bureaucrats inAliens.--David Chute", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301208773", "0767825411", "6305363668", "1558808221", "6300247171", "B00006RCSC", "6303148352", "6303257844", "B00000JGEI", "6303942830", "6305142467", "6303313345", "B000003KHS", "630407185X", "6304233639", "6304071876", "6300214826", "B000005QWI", "6303020089", "6302909023", "6301562178", "0800132009", "B00000ILE6", "B0001VL30O", "0800116917", "6303269834", "B0000CDL3W", "079073799X", "0783222955", "6301628454", "B00007CVYA", "6305718792", "B000054OW2", "6304259131"], "also_viewed": ["B00000JGEI", "6301792734", "6305363668", "6300213668", "6301208773", "6304233639", "0800125762", "6300213730", "6303402348", "6300214435", "6304117752", "0671676253", "6302814782", "0792151712", "0790740265", "6303257844", "B002GHHHKQ", "6303313345", "B001AQO3QA", "B007SPPANM", "B0087F7VSY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 435209}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.96, "brand": "", "asin": "6301562941", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/11JCR407ZAL.jpg", "title": "Abyss [VHS]"}

{"description": "Just as Roberto Benigni found himself on the receiving end of some finger-wagging for making a comedy set during the Holocaust, so the great Ernst Lubitsch caught some heat for this extraordinary 1942 satire set behind enemy lines during World War II. In his best performance on film, Jack Benny stars as Joseph Tura, the lead actor and head of a Polish theater troupe that is suddenly enlisted as a Resistance organization when an American pilot (Robert Stack) requires protection. The twist is that the pilot has been having a series of trysts with Tura's wife (Carole Lombard), the hilarious evidence being the disruptive departure of Stack's character from a theater audience each night as the hammy Tura unknowingly cues the lovers by launching into Hamlet's famous soliloquy. The remarkable script by Edwin Justus Mayer ingeniously folds the tensions of a betrayed marriage into the comic suspense surrounding Tura and company's efforts to pull off aMission: Impossible-like sting on the local Nazi command. Many unforgettable moments and lines of dialogue adorn this black comedy, and the performances--most memorably Sig Ruman's crisp volleys with Benny--are a dream. Above it all, however, is Lubitsch's unmistakable Continentalism, his accent on Old World manners especially in a dangerous situation, suggesting the Nazis' very vulgarity was a reflection of their profound evil.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302226899"], "also_viewed": ["B00CUKTGSA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 308722}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.0, "brand": "", "asin": "630170648X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ER4GRW8WL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "To Be Or Not to Be [VHS]"}

All worship Zardoz, a huge flying stone head who makes periodic visits to Earth to pick up grain consignments and issue bizarre statements involving the male anatomy through the voice of Arthur Frayn (Niall Buggy). An increasingly skeptical Zed decides to stow away inside the head, which deposits him in the Vortex, a commune of scientists and intellectuals who are ruled by the ever-youthful and asexual Eternals. They capture Zed, allowing geneticist May (Sara Kestleman) to use him as a research subject for a limited period, but he begins to arouse more than scientific curiosity in the commune's supposedly nonsexual female population.", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301801709"], "also_viewed": ["B00127IE0S"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 357031}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.11, "brand": "", "asin": "6301744128", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51M1VYRMB8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Zardoz [VHS]"}

{"description": "Victor Hugo's massive novel Les Miserables has spawned many adaptations in many forms over the years, and Twentieth Century Fox can count two respectable versions from its studio heyday. Both are included on this single-disc release. The superior version is the lavish 1935 take, for which producer Darryl F. Zanuck marshaled the studio's resources. While evocatively staged by director Richard Boleslawski and smartly condensed into punchy, vivid scenes, the movie is remembered for its indelible central performances: Fredric March as the hunted Jean Valjean and especially Charles Laughton as his letter-of-the-law pursuer, Inspector Javert. March, a sometimes stagey actor, is at his committed best, notably in the sequence where (in a single-scene second role) he plays the simpleton mistaken for the fugitive Valjean. But Laughton is completely fascinating: cruel and unforgiving, yet neurotic and weak; and Laughton brings out a tortured sexual undercurrent to Javert's pursuit. (Laughton didn't get an Oscar nomination for his performance, but he bagged one the same year for Mutiny on the Bounty; the film itself was nominated in four categories, including nods for Best Picture and Gregg Toland's cinematography.)", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00A32H1DO", "B0002235R6", "B00AQ79N82", "6304688377", "B005S9EK5Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 179944}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.57, "brand": "", "asin": "6301798570", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41TMRC696GL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Les Miserables [VHS]"}

This time, chemistry is virtually all they have in a veritable rehash of the first film. What plot there is has to do with Nolte's needing Murphy (who is just out of jail) to help him clear his own name and save his job on the police force. Director Walter Hill is back in place, but this time the script is the work of action hack Jeb Stuart and the movie barely gives Murphy room to unleash his comic riffs; when he does, we're expecting them (though he's still entertaining).--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300213749"], "bought_together": ["6300213749"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 457905}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.25, "brand": "", "asin": "6301854276", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515C737HSML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Another 48 Hours [VHS]"}

{"description": "If you've never seen an aviation movie before in your entire life, you'll be blissfully ignorant of the fact thatMemphis Belleshamelessly (and yet gloriously) incorporates just about every clich&eacute; in the flight-movie handbook. If you're a big fan of aviation movies--especially movies about World War II bomber crews--you'll be glad that the genre's clich&eacute;s have been handled with such professional flair. As it follows the crew of a B-17 bomber on its final and most dangerous mission over Germany,Memphis Bellemay be little more than a slick and highly authentic presentation of familiar thrills and characters, but it's a rousing piece of entertainment. Featuring an ensemble cast of fresh faces who've since enjoyed thriving careers (including Billy Zane, Sean Astin, Eric Stoltz, D.B. Sweeney, and Harry Connick Jr.), the movie exists as a fitting tribute to the men who fought and often died in the air over hostile territory. It's the Hollywood version of a 1944 wartime documentary made by legendary director William Wyler (whose daughter served as one of this film's producers), and as such it's a bit contrived and melodramatic. And yet, this exciting movie is almost certain to grab and hold your attention, offering an honorable reminder of the bravery and integrity that were crucial ingredients of any bomber's crew.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300181472", "6304039255", "6303109950"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 768181}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.89, "brand": "", "asin": "6301959957", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71CHSP45JQL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Memphis Belle [VHS]"}

But in doing so, she has crossed the wrong folks: the tightly knit group of nature's aberrations, who stick together like family--and who set out to avenge their little pal. Browning brought in some of the most famous sideshow attractions of the era, include Siamese twins Daisy and Violet Hilton and Johnny Eck the Legless Boy, as well as Zip and Pip, microcephalics whose appearance in this film inspired cartoonist Bill Griffith to create his comic strip, \"Zippy the Pinhead.\" So disturbing that it was banned for 30 years in Great Britain.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304359721", "B00000IQUT", "B000067JAW", "B00GH6U6J6", "0780018664"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 94847}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6301969588", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51S4FAAZPWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Freaks [VHS]"}

{"description": "Like moths to a flame, great actors gravitate to the singular genius of playwright-screenwriter David Mamet, who updated his Pulitzer Prize-winning play for this all-star screen adaptation. The material is not inherently cinematic, so the movie's greatest asset is Mamet's peerless dialogue and the assembly of a once-in-a-lifetime cast led by Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, and Alec Baldwin (the last in a role Mamet created especially for the film). Often regarded as a critique of the Reagan administration's impact on the American economy, the play and film focus on a competitive group of real estate salesmen who've gone from feast to famine in a market gone cold. When an executive \"motivator\" (Alec Baldwin) demands a sales contest among the agents in the cramped office, the stakes are critically high: any agent who fails to meet his quota of sales \"leads\" (i.e., potential buyers) will lose his job. This intense ultimatum is a boon for the office superstar (Pacino), but a once-successful salesman (Lemmon) now finds himself clinging nervously to faded glory. Political and personal rivalries erupt under pressure when the other agents (Alan Arkin, Ed Harris) suspect the office manager (Kevin Spacey) of foul play. This cauldron of anxiety, tension, and sheer desperation provides fertile soil for Mamet's scathingly rich dialogue, which is like rocket fuel for some of the greatest actors of our time. Pacino won an Oscar nomination for his volatile performance, but it's Lemmon who's the standout, doing some of the best work of his distinguished career. Director James Foley shapes Mamet's play into a stylish, intensely focused film that will stand for decades as a testament to its brilliant writer and cast.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303515223", "1558807780"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 369412}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.3, "brand": "", "asin": "6302732875", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51S2V1ZW1GL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Glengarry Glen Ross [VHS]"}
{"description": "Released in 1953,Monika, an early Ingmar Bergman-directed melodrama, did much to establish the reputation of Swedish cinema, and perhaps Swedish women in general, as leading the vanguard in sexual liberation. The film attracted the wrath of the censors and one scene of lovemaking had to be cut. While subsequent generations will look at the film and wonder whatever the fuss was about, it retains a vivid and frolicsome sensuality, before submitting to the inevitable Bergman bleakness.The film tells the story of a young couple, Harry (Lars Ekborg) and Monika (18-year-old Harriet Andersson, with whom Bergman would fall in love), stuck in lousy jobs in Stockholm. Harry is beset by parental responsibility--his mother died young and his father is ill--while Monika is fed up with her drunken, violent father. They escape in a motorboat to spend a blissful summer on an island in the archipelago. Once Monika gets pregnant and they're forced to steal food, however, the idyll concludes and they return to Stockholm, where the relationship disintegrates.

Thus the chief is put out when the clues in a murder case point to his old buddy, a dreadlocked ne'er-do-well played by a mischievous Robert Townsend. Director Carl Schenkel is much more interested in friendships and great island atmosphere than in the actual unlocking of the case, and that's just fine.

{"description": "You may be surprised to discover that the director of theLethal Weaponmovies and scary horror flickThe Omen, Richard Donner, also produced and directed this classic children's adventure (which, by the way, was written by Donner's screen-wizard friend Steven Spielberg). Then again you may not.The Goonies, like Donner's other movies, is the same story of good versus evil. It has its share of bad guys (the Fratelli brothers and their villainous mother), reluctant-hero good guys (the Walsh bothers and their gang of friends), and lots of corny one-liners. Like in an old-fashioned Hardy Boys or Nancy Drew plot, the Goonies need to solve a problem: a corrupt corporate developer has bought out their neighborhood and plans to flatten all their homes.

{"description": "Edward D. Wood Jr. was an actor writer-director-producer, occasionally in drag, who combined meager bursts of talent with an undying optimism to create some of the most bizarrely memorable \"B\" movies to ever come out of Tinseltown. Though Wood died in obscurity as an alcoholic in 1978, his films have been considered cult classics for years. He is consistently voted the worst director who ever lived. You would think this an odd subject, but director Tim Burton harnesses the undying hopefulness that made Wood such a character. Shot in black and white, just like Wood's creations, this stylized, witty production captures the poetic absurdity of Wood's films and his unconventional life. Burton's recreation of Wood's wonderfully awfulPlan 9 from Outer Spacelooks much better than the original low-budget quickie. Burton tackled an extremely strange subject matter for a biopic, but Wood is presented as naive almost to the point of delusion, so the story works. The pace sags in the middle, as the weirdness starts to wear thin, but Depp proves himself an adroit actor, even while wearing angora and a blonde wig. Wood's unconventional repertoire company is faithfully reproduced, including an Academy Award-winning Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi. Landau is pathetic, droll, and charismatic as the elderly junkie who made his last screen appearances in Wood's films.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301763041", "0800187873"], "bought_together": ["6301763041"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 314635}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.87, "brand": "", "asin": "6303407188", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F97RJE9XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ed Wood [VHS]"}

And Walter Matthau? No explanation needed.CombineI.Q.'s talent with its fresh story and it charms. Garage mechanic Ed Walters (Robbins) is captivated at first glimpse by pretty, perky Catherine (Ryan), a gifted academic who lives with her uncle, Albert Einstein (a brilliant Matthau). Catherine is engaged to pretentious James Moreland (the oh-so-appropriate English actor and writer Stephen Fry). Catherine's early 1950s world is all bookish and brainy, even though she has aspirations toward the romantic (Moreland's idea of a honeymoon is the Belgian Congo with Pygmies; she longs for Hawaii). Einstein and his professor pals, played by Lou Jacobi, Gene Saks, and Joseph Maher, conspire to match their beloved Catherine with the sincere and smart (though not intellectual) Ed.This is a sweet--but not saccharine--story about \"engineering\" the course of true love and the ironic triumph of heart over head.

And not as a historical example of blind propaganda--those (much shorter) movies are merely laughable now.

The early crowd scenes remind one of nothing so much as Beatles concert footage (if only their fans were so well behaved!).Like the fascists it monumentalizes,Triumph of the Willoverlooks its own weaknesses--at nearly two hours, the speeches tend to drone on, and the repeated visual motifs are a little over-hypnotic, especially for modern viewers.

{"description": "Carol White (Julianne Moore) is a mousy housewife living the affluent life in the San Fernando Valley when, over the span of a few months, she begins to develop debilitating sensitivities to her environment. A permanent at the hair salon makes her nose bleed and her skin go bad, exhaust from a truck causes her to cough violently, she's allergic to the new couch, goes into seizures at the dry cleaner's. No one understands or credits her condition, least of all her husband or family physician. But the symptoms worsen, and Carol eventually discovers others who suffer from similar environmental illnesses. She checks into a desert spa that caters to those in her predicament, and the staff regales her with touchy-feely,  infomercial-style affirmations. All of this could have been broad satire, but  director Todd Haynes (Velvet Goldmine) opts for a filming style that captures the empty elegance of Carol's passive lifestyle and looks on with clinical dispassion, so that you can hear the oppressive quiet surrounding her. It's positively eerie, so you know you're not watching just a worthy cause picture or movie of the week. Haynes has more ambition than that, even going so far as to insert a slight buzzing sound in the soundtrack to accentuate the unease. Fluorescent lights? Power lines? Who knows? Maybe it's safe to call it the ominous rumblings beneath the surface of Carol's life, from antiseptic affluence to septic isolation in the spa environment.

{"description": "David Mamet's 1987 directorial debut was this mesmerizing study of  control and seduction between two kinds of detached observers: a gambler who is also a con artist, and a psychotherapist who is also an emerging pop-psych guru in the book market. The latter (played by Lindsay Crouse) meets the former (Joe Mantegna) when one of her clients is driven to despair from his debts to the card shark. Mantegna's character agrees to drop the IOUs in exchange for Crouse's attention at the seedy House of Games in Seattle, a mecca for con men to talk shop and hustle unsuspecting customers. The shrink gets so caught up in the arcane rules and world view of her guide over subsequent days that she observes--with no false rapture--various stings in progress inside and outside the club. Mamet's story finally becomes a fascinating study of two people protecting and extending their respective cosmologies the way rival predators fight for the same piece of turf. The psychological challenge is compelling; so is the stylized dialogue, with its pattern of pauses and hiccups and humming meter. Mostly shooting at night, Mamet also gave Seattle a different look from previous filmmakers, turning its familiar puddles into concentrations of liquid neon and poisonous noir.--Tom Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 457760}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.23, "brand": "", "asin": "6304108877", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZYBSM6JRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "House of Games [VHS]"}
{"description": "Some people may sneer at this 1965 musical, but the truth is the film has earned its status as a perennially watchable romantic-drama, largely on the strength of a fun story and chemistry between stars Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer. Veteran filmmaker Robert Wise (The Day the Earth Stood Still) mostly stays out of the way of the film's appealing elements, which include a based-on-fact tale of Austria's von Trapp family, who fled their Nazi-occupied country in 1938. Andrews is delightful and even fascinating as Maria, who sheds her tomboyish ways as a novice nun to accept the mantle of adulthood, becoming matron of the motherless von Trapp clan. Plummer is matinee-idol handsome and gives a smart performance to boot, and the cast of young people and kids who make up the singing von Trapp children make a strong impression. Based on the Rodgers and Hammerstein stage musical, the score includes such winners as \"Maria\" and the future John Coltrane hit \"My Favorite Things.\"--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304400551", "6304178352", "6305123616", "B00000JS61", "6305282927", "B00000F6D1", "630233683X", "6304151306", "6302526574", "6303494390", "0792839846", "0792839129", "155890641X", "6303215734", "0788802194", "0788812807", "6301390725", "6303314015", "0788812408", "630150528X", "0790744759", "6303444202", "6300263673", "6302787068", "6304401132", "6302320402", "0788805533", "B00004TRD5", "6300246787", "6303854311", "B000056BRF", "0788805843", "0792151712", "B0041GWWUK", "6304500831", "6302091632", "6303168507", "630197736X", "6301586026", "6300207919", "6302642248", "6300215695", "0788806270", "B00005LL26", "B0000048YM", "6304089767", "5559477621", "6300275310", "6305229449", "6302178924", "6300277089", "6305750750", "6304331851", "6302936381", "B00000JKNP", "6300181111", "B0000AQZYM", "6300215814", "6300215830", "6300274195", "B002M2Z3BA", "6300213668", "B000035Z2S", "0788803743", "B00000491O", "B00000I1EM", "B00005RRG3", "B002HK9IDQ", "6301796535", "6305940932", "0783222955", "6303315305", "6302271991", "6301966317", "B00004RV8M", "0792840836", "6304100507", "6301972279", "0792837614", "6304546262", "B00005RRG5", "6303929338", "6302150620", "6300182304", "6305326940", "078881172X", "B0000E32WB", "6302816246", "6300215741", "6301792734", "B0000633ZP", "0800132009", "B00005RRG6", "B0002F6BQU", "B000059HH1", "6305177473", "B0000VCZKM", "6301971531", "0792839749"], "bought_together": ["6304400551"], "also_viewed": ["6304400551", "6304178352", "6303314015", "6305123616", "155890641X", "0788812408", "B00000JS61", "0788802194", "6302526574", "6302642248", "0792839129", "6305282927", "B00000F6D1", "078881172X", "6304500831", "6300274268", "6302158095", "6303215734", "B000035Z2S", "6304151306", "6304143184", "0792151712", "0788805843", "6304401132", "6302787068", "6300213668", "0788806270", "6301969707", "630233683X", "6305326940", "0792839846", "6305750750", "B00005LL26", "6302178924", "6304978286", "5559477621", "6303036813", "6303494390", "B00000JKNP", "6304539258", "6304873441", "6301792769", "6304290888", "6304718551", "B0041GWWUK", "B000003KHS", "6304089767", "6303929338", "6302091632", "6302961572", "B0007KTBIU", "6300263673", "6303675212", "6301752627", "6301792734", "B00FWMVVLS", "0783229011", "6304539274", "B00004TRD5"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 84952}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.94, "brand": "", "asin": "6304117752", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AESVTB4DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Sound of Music [VHS]"}

{"description": "A little-known chapter of American labor history is brought vividly to life in this period drama from writer-director John Sayles. It's a fictional story about labor wars among West Virginia coal miners during the 1920's, but every detail is so right that the film has the unmistakable ring of truth. The tension begins when the Stone Mountain Coal Company of Matewan, West Virginia, announces a lower pay rate for miners, who respond by calling a strike under the leadership of a United Mine Workers representative (Chris Cooper). Proving strength in numbers, the miners are joined by black and Italian miners who initially resist the strike, and a fateful battle ensues when detectives hired by the coal company attempt to evict miners from company housing. Violence erupts in a sequence of astonishing, cathartic intensity, andMatewanachieves a rare degree of moral complexity combined with gut-wrenching tragedy. The film salutes a pacifist ideal while recognizing that personal and political convictions often must be defended with violence. To illustrate this point, Sayles enlisted master cinematographer Haskell Wexler, who creates the film's authentic visual texture--a triumph of artistry over limited resources. The result is a milestone of independent filmmaking, andMatewanremains one of Sayles's finest achievements.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000N2HDG4", "6301996135"], "bought_together": ["B00005KA73"]}, "price": 39.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 319456}, "asin": "6304383657", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519GJ691F1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Matewan [VHS]"}
{"description": "A grandly entertaining, old-fashioned adventure based on the Rudyard Kipling short story,The Man Who Would Be Kingis the kind of rousing epic about which people said, even in 1975, &quot;Wow! They don't make 'em like that anymore!&quot; When director John Huston (The Maltese Falcon,The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,The African Queen) first started trying to make the film, with Gable and Bogart, the project was derailed by the latter's death. It was a few decades before Huston was able to finally realize his dream movie--and with an unimprovable cast. Sean Connery and Michael Caine are, respectively, Daniel Dravot and Peachy Carnahan, a pair of lovably roguish British soldiers who set out to make their fortunes by conning the priests of remote Kafiristan into making them kings. It's a rollicking tale, an epic satire of imperialism, and the good-natured repartee shared by Caine and Connery is pure gold. In today's screen adventures, humor is usually imposed on the material by a writer or director trying to make some kind of cleverly self-aware comment (&quot;Hey, we know it's a movie!&quot;), but that sort of jokiness can create so much ironic distance that it pushes the audience right out of the picture. Huston lets the humor emerge naturally from the characters, for whom we wind up caring more deeply than we ever expected.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["630197803X", "B000X825Z2", "6300262782", "6300146030", "0792835093", "0792835077", "B00004WZR1", "6303402070", "B000003KDG", "630407185X", "6301777476", "6300269043", "6302360978", "630238060X", "630442972X", "6302482712", "6301797906", "0766202771", "0780621956"], "bought_together": ["630197803X"], "also_viewed": ["B00IWULSTC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 382415}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6304457359", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NAD1N44BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Man Who Would Be King [VHS]"}

{"description": "Robert Towne is one of Hollywood's most celebrated screenwriters, but because his directorial efforts have been few and far between, anticipation was high when this star-powered crime story was released in 1988. Critical reaction was decidedly mixed, but there's plenty to admire in this silky, visually seductive film about a drug dealer (Mel Gibson) whose best friend from high-school (Kurt Russell) is now working for the Los Angeles sheriff's drug detail. Their personal and professional conflicts are intensified by their love for the same woman, a waitress (Michelle Pfeiffer) at the Italian restaurant they both frequent.

{"description": "It's not quite as clever as it tries to be, butThe Gamedoes a tremendous job of presenting the story of a rigid control freak trapped in circumstances that are increasingly beyond his control. Michael Douglas plays a rich, divorced, and dreadful investment banker whose 48th birthday reminds him of his father's suicide at the same age. He's locked in the cage of his own misery until his rebellious younger brother (Sean Penn) presents him with a birthday invitation to play \"The Game\" (described as \"an experiential Book of the Month Club\")--a mysterious offering from a company called Consumer Recreation Services. Before he knows the game has even begun, Douglas is caught up in a series of unexplained events designed to strip him of his tenuous security and cast him into a maelstrom of chaos. How do you play a game that hasn't any rules? That's what Douglas has to figure out, and he can't always rely on his intelligence to form logic out of what's happening to him. Seemingly cast as the fall guy in a conspiracy thriller, he encounters a waitress (Deborah Unger) who may or may not be trustworthy, and nothing can be taken at face value in a world turned upside down. Douglas is great at conveying the sheer panic of his character's dilemma, and despite some lapses in credibility and an anticlimactic ending,The Gameremains a thinking person's thriller that grabs and holds your attention.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0784011923", "B00000JGEI", "B00003CXE6", "6303447589", "6302256615", "6304078250", "6303012140", "B00000JGEK", "6301520106", "0792838211", "0792839846", "B00003JRAB", "B000006ORX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 399710}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.98, "brand": "", "asin": "6304765789", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZCZHZE36L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Game [VHS]"}

{"description": "Ole Bornedal's thriller about a young law student who takes a job as a night watchman in a creepy morgue is long on style but comes up a little short on quality of storytelling. Bornedal sets things up in high style as Martin Bells (Ewan McGregor doing an American accent) makes his rounds in the middle of the night, with only corpses and his own paranoia for company. When bodies start coming in, the prostitute victims of a grisly serial killer, the imposing detective on the case (a hulking Nick Nolte) begins to suspect that Bells is the killer, as all clues start pointing to him. Coscripted by Steven Soderbergh (Out of Sight) and adapted from Bornedal's 1994 Danish thriller,Nightwatchforsakes out-and-out thrills for a more moody approach with flickering lights, menacing shadows, and echoing footsteps down long hallways. If only there were a little more energy before the highly effective denouement, which does get scares, even after the killer is revealed. Still, McGregor is supported by a stronger than average cast: in addition to Nolte, Josh Brolin does an amusing turn as McGregor's out-of-control best friend, Patricia Arquette fares well in the standard girlfriend role, and the always creepy Brad Dourif makes the most of a sinister and funny bit part as the on-call doctor.

{"description": "There are many remarkable things about the documentary4 Little Girls. Spike Lee's striking, beautifully realized film is a cinematic lesson of what kind of material is better suited to the documentary format. In his first documentary, Lee shares an attribute of Ken Burns: the major event in his documentary is not seen on camera. Except for four quick glimpses of black-and-white autopsy photos, the picture stays clear from the bombing. Lee remains with the faces, the girls' friends, families, and the historic figures of the era. They've all grown up since the bombing but their memories haven't faded. The vital facts of the case are certainly here: the troubled history of Birmingham, the court proceedings, friends' last run-ins with the girls. What touches us deeper though are those witnesses telling us of living through the core era of segregation and bigotry: a father explaining to his child why she can't have a sandwich in a cafeteria and a woman offering up tears of past events. There's even an interview with George Wallace, the prince of segregation, that belongs in a David Lynch feature. Lee's film asserts the bombing energized the civil rights movement and when the voice of America, Walter Cronkite, echoes those sentiments, you believe he may have it right.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BBOUHM", "B00062IYXW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 363161}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.78, "brand": "", "asin": "6305080461", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/7104HSY0S9L._SY300_.gif", "title": "4 Little Girls [VHS]"}

{"description": "The definitive American television series of the '90s comes to the big screen with an anticlimactic whimper. And how could it be otherwise? Why should material so perfectly realized in one medium necessarily translate well into another? The series is crisply and thoughtfully executed in just about every detail, but the heart of its appeal lies in the elegant handling of complicated and evolving ongoing story lines, which is not something movies are especially good at. The big-screen drive for closure cramps the creative style, though it may also help nonfans get a grip on the proceedings. We do get some invigorating thrills and chills, however, and a more satisfying sense of the scale of an all-enveloping human-alien conspiracy than ever before, but there's no more plot development here than in an average two-part season-ending. FBI black sheep Mulder and Scully have been temporarily transferred from the X-Files project to an anti-terrorist unit to investigate an Oklahoma City-style bombing. They uncover a new wrinkle in the Syndicate/Cancer Man conspiracy--basically an attempt to help one bunch of (benign?) aliens fight off another bunch who want to colonize Earth. A spectacular, ice-bound finale thrillingly staged by series-veteran director Rob Bowman offers Mulder (but not a conveniently unconscious Scully) his first clear look at a You Know What, which in some quarters qualifies as an epochal event. Martin Landau offers the agents some crucial clues, and several familiar TV faces (including the Lone Gunmen and Mitch Pileggi's indispensable Assistant Director Skinner) turn up briefly to wink knowingly at faithful fans.--David Chute", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B001FACH7S", "B001G7PSZI", "B000UZDO5I", "6303402348", "080010367X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 338484}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.95, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "6305142467", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41GEJ8WNSKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The X-Files (Movie) [VHS]"}

{"description": "Halloweenis one of the great modern horror films, but as a franchise its track record has been spotty at best, painfully bad at worst.Halloween H2O: Twenty Years Later, directed by horror vet Steve Miner (Friday the 13thparts 2 and 3,House), won't displace John Carpenter's original but it might help you forget the films in between. Miner certainly has: the film begins as if sequels 3 through 6 never happened. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis, reprising her role for the first time in almost two decades) faked her death and is now a single mom and headmistress of an exclusive California private school. She's also a secret alcoholic who lives in fear of her homicidal brother-bogeyman Michael Myers. Guess who decides to show up for a family reunion? The film begins with classic horror-movie exposition (the deserted college campus, Michael's escape, Laurie's waking nightmares) accomplished with some humor and style, but it's all setup for the second half, a driving roller coaster of stalk-and-slash thrills. There's little of the self-conscious genre referencing ofScreamand at times the film is a little far-fetched--it is a slasher movie about a knife-wielding homicidal maniac who won't stay dead, after all--but Curtis transforms Laurie from a shrieking victim into an empowered, determined horror-movie heroine who's learned a thing or two from the previous films.

{"description": "Brian De Palma's 1998 thriller is largely an exercise in airing out his orchestral, oversized visual style (think of hisBlowout,Body Double, orRaising Cain) for the heck of it. The far-fetched story features Nicolas Cage as a crooked police detective attending a championship boxing match at which the Secretary of Defense is assassinated. The unfortunate Secretary's right-hand man (Gary Sinise) happens to be Cage's old friend, a fact that complicates the cop's efforts to reconstruct the crime from conflicting accounts--a directorial strategy bearing similarities to Kurosawa'sRashomon. The outrageousness of the scenario essentially gives De Palma permission to construct a baroque cathedral of spectacular camera stunts, which (he well knows) are inevitably more interesting than the hoary conspiracy plot. (The opening scene alone, which runs on for a number of minutes and consists of one, unbroken shot that moves in from the street, following Cage up and down stairs, and in and out of rooms until finally ending ringside at the match, is breathtaking.) The shifting points of view--based on the contradictory statements of witnesses--also give De Palma license to get creative with camera angles and scene rearrangements.  The script bogs down in the third act, but De Palma is just revving up for a big, operatic finish that is absolutely gratuitous but undeniably impressive. Yes, it's style over substance inSnake Eyes, but what style we're talking about.--Tom Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1083279}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6305230226", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515XQ8D9Z5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Snake Eyes [VHS]"}
{"description": "Angie Dickinson stars as a bank-robbing matriarch in this 1974  Roger Corman production, often described as a knock-off ofBonnie and Clyde. (As if that makes any difference regarding the worth of the film--which is  pretty good.) Set in Great Depression-era Texas, the story finds Dickinson's desirable and poor character driven to crime, along with her two  daughters (Susan Sennett, Robbie Lee), all of whom use sex to distract or drive  men into culpability. The film, directed by Steve Carver, is pure Corman  formula: fast-moving, violent, gritty, adorned with nudity, and yet solidly true  to its own sense of high drama and texture. Veteran Angie Dickinson brings solid acting chops (and a great bod on display) to the enterprise--and speaking ofEnterprise, William Shatner is quite memorable (as is Tom  Skerritt) as one of the gentlemen who fall under the antiheroine's sway.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0047DKLCI", "B0042FUHUW", "B006UKX6GO", "B00005K3NU", "B004AZ7ZLI", "B004IB04RG", "B006M3M5FM", "B004XIWRW4", "B004ULEENE", "B004RBC5U6", "B004ZKKKXI", "B005SQRYN2", "B00817MQBK", "B005BUA1FS", "B009R68H80", "B009R68HFI", "B004YMATCY", "B0030VANHQ", "B0058O1FES", "B0008KLVA0", "B004HHX9OQ", "B00005UM2Y", "B00ESZZOLI", "B002DQSKMY", "B005XB8T68", "B003XL6EIA", "B000E1EHPY", "B0055CP9HW", "B00ESZZOMM", "B00097DY2A", "B00FB349R6", "B0007R4T3A", "B005FQ2HEQ", "B00JDOQM38", "B00CG4XKSM", "B003VOVW0O", "B0007W6HVM", "B006OT0UUQ", "B00JDOQMH4", "B00EOYK616", "B00GRZPRB4", "B0062VL4YW", "B00049QJBG", "B00BLQBQYQ", "B002AT4JNI", "B000TZJCNM", "B00310PSVC", "B00EALTWHW", "B00HW3EJ6Y", "B0089AJDNS", "B004NJC0J8", "B005FQ2H9Q", "B0009GX1CE", "B00I5TYNZ6", "B007V6ON9A", "B00CWHWV7O", "B0010T3ULQ", "B003THSXJ6", "B000F0UUD2", "B00005RIY1", "B00HNTOVX8", "B00KFNF2T6", "B000YQUXJ8", "B0000UX5JS", "B000193318", "B000HT38EO", "B000EZ9084", "B0038SUBEG", "B00005U8EP", "B000069HZO", "B000OYCMLW", "B00CPTUO1Y", "B0038SUBF0", "B00EUEWR6W", "B00005JMU1", "B00ID8H98C", "B00K0MM4AM", "B000E3LKKM", "B003XMKU1G", "B006Z7Z3VS", "B004ZKKL3M", "B000059TOB", "6305308829", "B00310PSUI", "B002AT4JN8", "B004IB04NK", "076782170X", "B00B022GVS", "0792846877", "B004IN21VQ", "6305127654", "B001URA5Y8", "B006J6CEN0", "B000PMFRYC", "B00E8G5HXM", "B003THSXJG", "B00DDXEJE4"], "bought_together": ["B0047DKLCI", "B006M3M5FM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005K3NU", "B0047DKLCI", "B006M3M5FM", "B004HHX9OQ"]}, "price": 39.49, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 294545}, "asin": "6305261326", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/718QX8CM5VL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Big Bad Mama"}

{"description": "For years, conventional wisdom has had it that Ed Wood Jr.'sPlan 9 from Outer Spaceis the ultimate \"bad movie,\" a sort of Holy Grail of cinematic ineptitude. Often lost in the shuffle, though, isBride of the Monster(fans of Tim Burton's biopicEd Woodwill already be familiar with it and the offscreen misadventures that went along with it). Bela Lugosi plays Dr. Vornoff, a mad scientist working on a race of superbeings in his lab. His process of  clamping a metal lampshade onto the heads of his subjects and zapping them with radiation usually kills them, but the monstrous Lobo (Tor Johnson) survives and becomes Vornoff's assistant. Vornoff's plans go awry, though, when he tries to get a nosy reporter to mate with Lobo and winds up being given the atom treatment himself. Suffice it to say that there's a grappling match between Vornoff and Lobo until the evil doctor falls into a pit and wrestles a rubber octopus. Stock footage of lightning and an atomic explosion round things out for a great non sequitur of an ending. Knowing Bela Lugosi's sad state by the time that he and Ed Wood had teamed up makes it hard to watch this movie without feeling a pang of pathos for the 73-year-old actor; indeed,Bridewas his last speaking role. Still, any movie with as many obvious gaffes in direction, editing, set design, narrative (heck, take your pick) asBrideis a must for any connoisseur of bad movies.--Jerry Renshaw", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 990779}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6305389284", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VAZSWN3ML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bride of the Monster [VHS]"}
{"description": "Italy's rubber-faced funnyman Roberto Benigni accomplishes the  impossible in his World War&nbsp;II comedyLife Is Beautiful: he shapes a  simultaneously hilarious and haunting comedy out of the tragedy of the Holocaust. An international sensation and the most successful foreign language film in U.S. history, the picture also earned director-cowriter-star Benigni Oscars for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Actor. He plays the Jewish country boy Guido, a madcap romantic in Mussolini's Italy who wins the heart of his sweetheart (Benigni's real-life sweetie, Nicoletta Braschi) and raises a darling son (the adorable Giorgio Cantarini) in the shadow of fascism. When the Nazis ship the men off to a concentration camp in the waning days of the war, Guido is determined to shelter his son from the evils around them and convinces him they're in an elaborate contest to win (of all things) a tank. Guido tirelessly maintains the ruse with comic ingenuity, even as the horrors escalate and the camp's population continues to dwindle--all the more  impetus to keep his son safe, secure, and, most of all, hidden. Benigni walks a fine line mining comedy from tragedy and his efforts are pure fantasy--he accomplishes feats no man could realistically pull off--both of  which have drawn fire from a few critics. Yet for all its wacky humor and inventive gags,Life Is Beautifulis a moving and poignant tale of one father's sacrifice to save not just his young son's life but his innocence in the face of one of the most evil acts ever perpetrated by the human race.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003JLL2RW", "B00007G25J", "B00000493Q", "6300216012", "0800100832"], "bought_together": ["B003JLL2RW"], "also_viewed": ["B0033PQUXA", "B00B0U2SEA", "B004SEUJ82", "6305291403", "0784011710", "B0010YSD7W", "B00AYXEW0C", "B000HEWEJO", "B000FVQLRA", "B0002CX1NY", "6303215734", "0783233477", "B00AEFY0F2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 290895}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.96, "brand": "", "asin": "6305426651", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51W27JXJYQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Life Is Beautiful (La Vita E Bella) [VHS]"}
{"description": "The Front Page, Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur's classic 1928 newspaper play, has had three official film versions and contributed structural DNA to half the movies ever made about professional camaraderie and fierce love-hate friendships. Lewis Milestone's 1931 movie is well respected (Billy Wilder's 1974 version isn't), but this is one case where the remake towers brilliantined head and blocked shoulders above the original.Howard Hawks had the inspired notion of making Hildy Johnson--the ace newsman whom demonic editor Walter Burns is trying to keep from quitting and getting married--a she instead of a he. What's more, she's not only Walter's star reporter but also his ex-wife. When Hildy (Rosalind Russell) comes to tell Walter (Cary Grant) she's leaving the newspaper business, he bamboozles her into carrying out one last assignment--a death-row interview with a little nebbish (John Qualen) convicted of killing a policeman. It sounds like a snap, but before you can say screwball comedy, the press room of the Criminal Courts Building has become ground zero for all the lunacy a jailbreak, a shooting, an impromptu suicide, a corrupt city administration, and the most Machiavellian \"hero\" in the American cinema can supply.His Girl Fridayis one of the, oh, five greatest dialogue comedies ever made; Hawks had his cast play it at breakneck speed, and audiences hyperventilate trying to finish with one laugh so they can do justice to the four that have accumulated in the meantime. Russell, not Hawks's first choice to play Hildy, is triumphant in the part, holding her own as \"one of the guys\" and creating an enduring feminist icon. Grant is a force of nature, giving a performance of such concentrated frenzy and diamond brilliance that you owe it to yourself to devote at least one viewing of the movie to watching him alone. But then you have to go back (lucky you) and watch it again for the sake of the press-room gang--Roscoe Karns, Porter Hall, Cliff Edwards, Regis Toomey, Frank Jenks, and others--the kind of ensemble work that gets character actors onto Parnassus.--Richard T.

{"description": "Wes Anderson's follow-up to the quirkyBottle Rocketis a wonderfully unorthodox coming-of-age story that ranks withHarold and MaudeandThe Graduatein the pantheon of timeless cult classics. Jason Schwartzman (son of Talia Shire and nephew of Francis Coppola) stars as Max Fischer, a 15-year-old attending the prestigious Rushmore Academy on scholarship, where he's failing all of his classes but is the superstar of the school's extracurricular activities (head of the drama club, the beekeeper club, the fencing club...). Possessing boundless confidence and chutzpah, as well as an aura of authority he seems to have been born with, Max finds two unlikely soulmates in his permutations at Rushmore: industrial magnate and Rushmore alumnus Herman Blume (Bill Murray) and first-grade teacher Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams). His alliance with Blume and crush on Miss Cross, however, are thrown out of kilter by his expulsion from Rushmore, and a budding romance between the two adults that threatens Max's own designs on the lovely schoolteacher.Never stooping to sentimentality or schmaltz, Anderson and cowriter Owen Wilson have fashioned a wickedly intelligent and wildly funny tale of young adulthood that hits all the right notes in its mix of melancholy and optimism. As played by Schwartzman, Max is both immediately endearing and ferociously irritating: smarter than all the adults around him, with little sense of his shortcomings, he's an unstoppable dynamo who commands grudging respect despite his outlandish projects (including a school play about Vietnam). Murray, as the tycoon who determinedly wages war with Max for the affections of Miss Cross, is a revelation of middle-aged resignation. Disgusted with his family, his life, and himself, he's turned around by both Max's antagonism and Miss Cross's love. Williams is equally affecting as the teacher who still carries a torch for her dead husband, and the superb supporting cast also includes Seymour Cassel as Max's barber father, Brian Cox as the frustrated headmaster of Rushmore, and a hilarious Mason Gamble as Max's young charge.

As Capa gets closer to identifying the killer of his patient, Rose becomes an equally tantalizing mystery that he must solve -- if he can stay alive long enough to avoid a lunatic murderer who is stalking him.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003P9GN72", "B000VLCRCW", "B000EQ5SRK", "B00AEFYD2M", "B002AS463W", "0767807588", "076782170X", "B00005JMIJ", "B00008L3S6", "B00005JKI5", "B00006L92K", "B008XAT1LS", "B000TXPXAU", "B00006L91I", "B000E5N684", "B00008972P", "B000PMFS2I", "B0010SAGHS", "B00E8G5HXM", "B00023P4I8", "B00005V4XV", "6305308837", "B00000J11D", "B003XKNGNW", "B004SEUJEG", "B000HC2LHG", "B000RO9Q7W", "B0000ZMGWK", "B000193318", "B00GRZPRB4", "B000HT38EO", "1573623857", "B0043X1FNQ", "B0001GF2D8", "B006M3M5FM", "B0002KPIQY", "6305132917", "B000CBG5PG", "B00GPPXNIK", "B00008CMRK", "B0007W6HVM", "B00005K3NU", "B000BBOUUE", "B000EZ9084", "0783230559", "B00005LPZW", "B000H5TH1Q", "B0002T7YQW", "B00CPTUO1Y", "B00K0MM4AM", "B0019K4YT8", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B002AS466O", "B004GBMVTW", "B0043X1FKY", "B00004Y87P", "B0045HCIYA", "B0043X1FLI", "B0001NBLZ4", "B00005QJIG", "B0004Z32NI", "B00K31RBYY", "B000BX0VT6", "6304698747", "B0052ADPAU", "0783226888", "B000BGH29K", "B0020LH8WU", "B000BRP4BM", "B0009JMKIW", "B000GI3KGC", "B00004STDC", "6304779631", "B00ET2ODTE", "B001AZKB8K", "B0052ADPCI", "B000PKG8TM", "B009M4KTUG", "B0000633R7", "B000PMFRZ6", "0767817761", "B00HQLZC18", "B000068QPV", "B00APUAKYG", "B000PAAJZ6", "B0043X1FKO", "B0000TWNDI", "6305065551", "B00BTYOYGW", "B000008MOF", "B00A7WHL08", "B00BTYRB58", "0790730979", "B000069HZO", "B005ZVIPG0", "B000VTHYAE", "B0000D0YXV"], "bought_together": ["B003P9GN72"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008XAT1LS", "076782170X", "B002AS463W", "B000VLCRCW"]}, "price": 9.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17330}, "asin": "6305428484", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XZ8TR23SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Color of Night (Director's Cut)"}

{"description": "InThe Bat, top-billed Vincent Price brings his silky sinister elegance to the second remake of the hoary \"old dark house\" stage play, but the real star of the show is Agnes Moorehead as an eccentric mystery writer who decides to pull off the million-dollar bank heist and the steel-clawed killer known only as \"The Bat.\" Price's devious doctor is but one of a rogues gallery of suspects that include a Johnny-on-the-spot police detective, a chauffeur turned butler with a checkered past, and a housekeeper with echoes ofRebecca's Mrs. Danvers. Moorehead is a kick as the spirited author and makes the most of her expanded role, but fans of the early film productions (1926'sThe Batand 1930'sThe Bat Whispers, both directed by Roland West) will be less forgiving of other changes, especially writer-director Crane Wilbur's decision to draw the story out over a succession of nights. Wilbur loses the tension and claustrophobia of the originals with handsome but airy photography, more appropriate to an episode ofPerry Mason, and a rambling pace. Moorehead and Price bring a little spirit to the otherwise bland film, but not quite enough.William Castle's gimmick-laden comic thrillerHouse on Haunted Hillis not so much a horror movie as a fairground fun house come to life. Vincent Price stars as a deliciously silky millionaire married to a greedy gold digger (Carol Ohmart) who refuses to divorce him. When he turns his wife's idea for a haunted-house party into a contest--$10,000 to whoever can spend the night in \"the only truly haunted house in the world\"--it seems he may have found an alternative to divorce. Five strangers gather to test their stamina, Price hands each of them most delightfully twisted party favors ever imagined (loaded handguns, delivered in their own tiny coffins), and the spook show begins. Blood drips from the ceiling, zombielike apparitions float through rooms, severed heads and skeletons suddenly appear, and then a guest is found hanging in the stairwell. Full of screams and shocks and things that go bump in the night,House on Haunted Hillisn't particularly scary and often makes little sense, but, like a Halloween haunted house, the gag-laden spectacle of spook-show clich&eacute;s is quite entertaining and Price makes a sardonic master of ceremonies. The original theatrical presentations featured a typically outrageous Castle-engineered gimmick: Emergo, which was nothing more than a skeleton that appeared to fly out of the screen and over the audience on a guide wire.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001BSBBGC", "B00LMBURV8", "B00009PY4D", "B00000K3U3", "B00LMBURDG", "B00FMGPWNW", "B00H4KQN82", "B000FKO3VM", "B00009NHBC", "B000068TPF", "B00009PY4A", "B00FERT0PK", "B00FM4S68W", "B001BSBBNK", "B005AMJ3B0", "B00LBFFR2Y", "B00JHH22O4", "B00009PY45", "B00GNZM03G", "B0007R4SZY", "B001AD6UFA", "B000RXVNDI", "B00DI68EBK", "B00LC4PFVW", "B00DOZNGC2", "B005AMJ36U", "B00005AUK0", "B00LC4PBTS", "B00DE1LD6W", "B00DOZNI8Y", "B00K6D1R0I", "B00L22H2IS", "B00K6D1S7A", "B00H7BJ0C4", "B00DZP1C9K", "B00D9EJFV4", "B00005NKTH", "B00FOLGW3E", "B00KIZY2QA", "B00ITZXDDY", "B00L8QOZK6", "B00FGAKEEQ", "B00000ILEU", "B00KOW4BOU", "B000068TPE", "B00EU8RBZK", "B00D9EJFZA", "B000FWHW8Q", "B00HZVX14O", "B00IYJFB2G", "B008FYZHPG", "B00KIZYDCI", "B00GH6U6J6", "B0009X770E", "B000WNHTCC", "B00E0FW0M2", "B00005N5RQ", "B00005R1O7", "B000RXVND8", "B004NDJXNK", "B001BSBBMQ", "B00FJYXP36", "B00JJOY47I", "B00JV054A6", "B00JV054CO", "B0088XQDTS", "B00K1L4NBU", "B004LB5FAY", "B00DTECHWS", "B00IF0KAYS", "B004RPQSVE", "B00L6AW1K0", "B004CZZZ0O", "B0033PSH6S", "B00JJOY45U", "B00HRUQ8X4", "B000FWHW90", "B00CLIAACC", "B007HCI4SE", "B00000JQB7", "B0000694WH", "B000068TPG", "B004X63SCY", "B005ETAN7C", "B005E7SFDI", "B00EO2I6RO", "B000UDGOBG", "B00E3H3CO2", "B00EBDXVVW", "B00FL2F1O2", "B000RXVNCY", "B005ZVINFS", "B0034PWPHY", "B00005K3OF", "B004RPQSNM", "B00E21D8M0", "B00D80GMP6", "B003IRUFBG", "B002DY9KQG", "B00005LC4N"], "bought_together": ["B001BSBBGC", "B00000K3U3"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001AD6UFA", "B001BSBBGC", "B00000K3U3", "B002NZK5X2"]}, "price": 13.46, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 411447}, "asin": "6305436452", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71CQPQ131EL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Horror Classics, Vol. 3: The Bat/House on Haunted Hill"}

{"description": "Edward Scissorhandsachieves the nearly impossible feat of capturing the delicate flavor of a fable or fairy tale in a live-action movie. The story follows a young man named Edward (Johnny Depp), who was created by an inventor (Vincent Price, in one of his last roles) who died before he could give the poor creature a pair of human hands. Edward lives alone in a ruined Gothic castle that just happens to be perched above a pastel-colored suburb inhabited by breadwinning husbands and frustrated housewives straight out of the 1950s. One day, Peg (Dianne Wiest), the local Avon lady, comes calling. Finding Edward alone, she kindly invites him to come home with her, where she hopes to help him with his pasty complexion and those nasty nicks he's given himself with his razor-sharp fingers. Soon Edward's skill with topiary sculpture and hair design make him popular in the neighborhood--but the mood turns just as swiftly against the outsider when he starts to feel his own desires, particularly for Peg's daughter Kim (Winona Ryder). Most of director Tim Burton's movies (such asPee Wee's Big Adventure,Beetlejuice,Batman) are visual spectacles with elements of fantasy, butEdward Scissorhandsis more tender and personal than the others. Edward's wild black hair is much like Burton's, suggesting that the character represents the director's own feelings of estrangement and co-option. Johnny Depp, making his first successful leap from TV to film, captures Edward's childlike vulnerability even while his physical posture evokes horror icons like the vampire inNosferatuand the sleepwalker inThe Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.

{"description": "You don't fool with Mother Nature, spit into the wind, remakeCasablanca, or trash the land of Oz. Perhaps that is why the 1985 live-action sequel split critics and audiences alike. The 1939 classic musical is so beloved that it's almost impossible to imagine seeing Dorothy in shock therapy, a crumbled yellow brick road, the ruins of Emerald City, and the Tin Man turned into stone. But L. Frank Baum, the author of the originalOzbooks, portrayed just that with his continuing stories of Dorothy. When you get by these tough facts, the film version is solid entertainment for the over-7 set.Dorothy (a 10-year-old Fairuza Balk in her debut) is back in Kansas, where Aunt Em (Piper Laurie) is at the end of her rope: her niece is not sleeping and going on about a place called Oz. Therapy may be the answer, but luckily the scary clinic goes dark before Dorothy can be, er, cured (but the lead-up will scare the munchkins out of most kids). She wakes up in the land of Oz, now in tatters, and searches for its king, the Scarecrow. A new set of friends, including a tin soldier, a talking chicken, and a pumpkin man, help her against new villains, including Princess Mombi (Jean Marsh)--complete with a set of detachable heads--and the evil Nome King (Nicol Williamson with a great assist from Will Vinton's Claymation). The sole directorial effort of Oscar-winning editor Walter Murch is stuffed with marvelous effects that foreshadow later works by Tim Burton and the Henson non-Muppet films.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302642256", "6304978286", "B00000JPH5", "0764005685", "6303212395", "B00000JPH4", "B000JYIZAY", "6304340648", "B00005OLY5"], "also_viewed": ["B006VJ1AAI", "B00I6JOBTI"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 193659}, "asin": "B00000JMQC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71DA4FZHGZL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Return to Oz [VHS]"}

{"description": "Schizoid serial killer Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) has  been captured at last, but a neurological seizure has rendered him  comatose, and FBI agent Peter Novak (Vince Vaughan) has no way to  determine the location of Stargher's latest and still-living victim. To  probe the secrets contained in Stargher's traumatized psyche, the FBI  recruits psychologist Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez), who has  mastered a new technology that allows her to enter the mind of another person. What she finds in Stargher's head is a  theater of the grotesque, which, as envisioned by first-time director  Tarsem Singh, is a smorgasbord of the surreal that borrows liberally  from the Brothers Quay, Czech animator Jan Svankmajer, Hieronymous  Bosch, Salvador Dali, and a surplus of other cannibalized sources.This provides one of the wildest, weirdest visual feasts ever committed  to film, andThe Cellearns a place among such movie mind-trips  as2001: A Space Odyssey,Altered States,What Dreams  May Come, andUn Chien Andalou. Is this a good thing? Sure,  if all you want is freakazoid eye-candy. If you're looking for emotional depth,  substantial plot, and artistic coherence,The Cellis sure to  disappoint. The pop-psychology pablum of Mark Protosevich's screenplay  would be laughable if it weren't given such somber significance, and  Singh's exploitative use of sadomasochistic imagery is repugnant (this  movie makesSevenlook tame), so you're better off marveling at  the nightmare visions that are realized with astonishing potency.The Cellis too shallow to stay in your head for long, but while  it's there, it's one hell of a show.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0026LYLTM", "B001BPJJ9G", "B003TRMLQM", "6305238065", "B00005UQ9W", "0767805763", "0783229402", "B000OYC7BW", "B008NNY8RM", "B000BMY2MO", "B0000CERP3", "B000O76ZQC", "B0045HCJSU", "B00006SFKM", "0767821629", "B000K4X5P8", "B00AEBBA2W", "B000VUFJ0K", "B00011CZRE", "B001MVYUR0", "B00009QUH4", "B000NQRR1Q", "B000TJ6PBK", "B00006HAWN", "B00009MGEM", "B00005R5GF", "B0018O4YT0", "B0001EFTTW", "B00441GYVK", "B00005NRO0", "B00000I1KK", "0783237413", "B00003CXKA", "B000063US5", "B00005ATQB", "B00441GYXI", "B002OVB9YE", "B00BTYNXJG", "B00000JSJC", "6305718954", "B0012680CQ", "B001JNNDJM", "B000GCFO0I", "B0037XPP8Y", "B00K57K2JM", "B004EPYZU8", "B00008EY9G", "B0000AC8LR", "B00AEFXW8I", "B00003CXXP", "B004SEUJOQ", "B001R3YRG2", "B00013RC7K", "B0000AVHCD", "6305313687", "B0016BO72O", "B00DW5IKYS", "B00005JOWW", "B00006FDCD", "B00003CXPS", "B007I1Q54O", "B00005JMWP", "B0009G3B0G", "B0006GAOMW", "B0007Y08QA", "B004P7CN7W", "B00005N5RM", "B00005JLWN", "B002VRNIZO", "B0001Z52RU", "B00005Q4CS", "B000069I1I", "B008HUSFXO", "B00AJXO56I", "B00BLN4UPG", "B0009X75J2", "B00006JDU8", "B003VA3JUO", "B00005JKLZ", "B000053UIF", "B00005V1WW", "0783229526", "B002KLQ2ZO", "0780622650", "B005FUTBWS", "B0006L0LOS", "0780627849", "0783240295", "B000LP6KNU", "B000U7169M", "B000RGN2JI", "B000GI3KGC", "B00003CY6P", "0767824954", "B0009A40ES", "B0002CX22E", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00005UQ9I", "B00003CWRF", "B00005N7Z1"], "bought_together": ["B0026LYLTM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001BPJJ9G", "B003TRMLQM", "B005CFBYW6", "B000A343RI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 25555}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 10.99, "brand": "New Line Studios", "asin": "B00003CXKM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2BF5HiVvcL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Cell (New Line Platinum Series)"}

{"description": "LikeSaving Private Ryan,Enemy at the Gatesopens with a  pivotal event of World War II--the German invasion of  Stalingrad--re-created in epic scale, as ill-trained Russian soldiers  face German attack or punitive execution if they flee from the enemy's  advance. Director Jean-Jacques Annaud captures this madness with urgent  authenticity, creating a massive context for a more intimate battle  waged amid the city's ruins. Embellished from its basis in fact, the  story shifts to an intense cat-and-mouse game between a Russian shepherd  raised to iconic fame and a German marksman whose skill is unmatched in  its lethal precision. Vassily Zaitzev (Jude Law) has been sniping Nazis  one bullet at a time, while the German Major Konig (Ed Harris) has been  assigned to kill Vassily and spare Hitler from further embarrassment.There's love in war as Vassily connects with a woman soldier (Rachel  Weisz), but she is also loved by Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), the Soviet  officer who promotes his friend Vassily as Russia's much-needed hero.  This romantic rivalry lends marginal interest to the central plot, but  it's not enough to make this a classic war film. Instead it's a taut,  well-made suspense thriller isolated within an epic battle, and although  Annaud and cowriter Alain Godard (drawing from William Craig's book and  David L. Robbins's novelThe War of the Rats) fail to connect  the parallel plots with any lasting impact, the production is never less  than impressive.

{"description": "InOur Song, director Jim McKay takes the same concerns as in his debut,Girls Town--friendship, poverty, and suicide--and crafts a superior film. WhileGirls Townfelt like a somewhat privileged look at underprivileged life,Our Songfeels as if it were written by the young women themselves: Lanisha (Lift's Kerry Washington), Joy (Anna Simpson), and Maria (Melissa Martinez). In fact, the trio really was involved with Brooklyn marching band the Jackie Robinson Steppers when McKay recruited them to star in this Michael Stipe-produced effort, and the marching sequences in the film provide a rousing counterpoint to the difficulties with which the girls are grappling. When one of the 15-year-olds discovers she's pregnant, already-frayed relationships are strained to the breaking point.Our Songalways rings true and is all the more admirable--and affecting--for its refusal to conform to the conventions of most Hollywood teen movies.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "A prime example of the American film noir style that flourished during the 1940s and '50s,The Big Combois now highly regarded as a stylistic milestone for its innovative use of deep shadows and harsh, singular light sources to define its visual strategy. This look is largely credited to the rule-breaking brilliance of cinematographer John Alton, who turns a standard plot of the era into a richly atmospheric experiment in visual invention. Ignoring conventional approaches to lighting, Alton defines the screen in terms of blackness, often framing characters as silhouettes cast in ominous grays or thick, roiling fogs. Moving from clarity to abstraction with masterful grades in between, Alton's trend-setting style has been celebrated by cinematographers since the film's release in 1955.The film's plot keeps brisk pace with the visuals, focusing on the obsessive efforts of a tenacious detective (Cornel Wilde) to destroy a sadistic mobster (Richard Conte) whose vicious influence has nearly ruined the life of the woman (Jean Wallace) he keeps under his dark wing. Lee Van Cleef and Earl Holliman are nicely cast as the villain's toady henchmen, and Brian Donlevy's usual limitations serve him well as the humbled, frustrated kingpin who's been stifled by Conte's ambition. Director  Joseph&nbsp;H. Lewis previously demonstrated his raw, stylistic vigor with the  earlier cult favoriteGun Crazy, and here he's in peak form with a perfect match of subject and sensibility. The result is hard-boiled entertainment that still packs a punch.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00EL6A7XE", "B00E21D9ME", "B00023P4GA", "B009X919UE", "B0009X7678", "B00E6AVGKI", "B00C3ALM02", "B000KJTGFG", "B00D09AXUA", "B0007ZEO7S", "B0080JG2GE", "B00FPUN21O", "B001CC7PM6", "B004C2523M", "B000B8384Q", "B000B8380A", "B00BGARG3C", "B000EXDSBQ", "B00ICWO1LC", "B00I9BU60Q", "B00023P4II", "B0007ZEO8C", "B0024FAG80", "B00023P4FQ", "B00023P4G0", "B0024FAG8A", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B000B83846", "B00DO0MEOS", "B00005RDRL", "B000CNE088", "B00CN70WS8", "B00005AUK9", "B00004W19C", "B000RXVND8", "B0006UEVVS", "B000LN6UHI", "B000EXDSBG", "B00I9BU3M2", "B00007ELD1", "B0009X7682", "B00DBE97S8", "B00004XPPK", "B0006Z2NE0", "B000087F79", "B00004W229", "B00I9BU3L8", "B000CNE08I", "B00BM4Q46M", "B00KIZY3XW", "B0000CNY4Z", "B0010KHOSU", "B00BM4Q4PI", "B0089LT800", "B0089LT7ZG", "B00H8J2NTC", "B004H0M2UK", "B002YNQEFG", "B00CVB6XF2", "B00097DXY4", "B000244EWY", "B0024FAG6W", "B00DZP1BVO", "B00006II5J", "B0000EYUDY", "B000244EX8", "B000BGH2NG", "B00I116MVQ", "B00B27WRJM", "B00AB2NX4M", "B00B27WQ6G", "B001CC7PLW", "B00005AUKD", "B000FKO3VC", "B00AEBBA7W", "B00012L786", "B000FKO3VM", "B0080JG2L4", "B00004RER5", "B00FX6TYZS", "B00005Y70U", "B006X0ZN3K", "6305770328", "B00005Y70Q", "B00457ZNS8", "B00AB2NX1K", "B00DZP1C9K", "B0009X766O", "B00JX3SHIC", "B006WQUGI2", "B00KIZYDCI", "B008BSM1CI", "B000PKG7CU", "B008BSM1XC", "B0010KHOSA", "B0026ZQJT8", "B005152C9G", "B00DBE98OG", "B00D9BNONW", "B000CNE08S"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BGARG3C", "B00EL6A7XE", "B0087ZG7OI", "B00E21D9ME"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 349701}, "asin": "B00003XALW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/714FYEYPNDL._SY300_.gif", "title": "The Big Combo"}

He has his crew bail out safely, but figures it is curtains for himself. He gets on the radio, and talks to June, a young American woman working for the USAAF, and they are quite moved by each other's voices. Then he jumps, preferring this to burning up with his plane. He wakes up in the surf. It was his time to die, but there was a mixup in heaven. They couldn't find him in all that fog. By the time his \"Conductor\" catches up with him 20 hours later, Peter and June have met and fallen in love. This changes everything, and since it happened through no fault of his own, Peter figures that heaven owes him a second chance.

{"description": "Long beforePleasantville, this 1992 comedy featured a family  taking its problems out of the real world and into the loopy fictions of television  entertainment. John Ritter and Pam Dawber star as Roy and Helen Knable, a  suburban couple with a host of marital problems, most of which have to do  with Roy's couch-potato attachment to his TV's remote control. Things take a  hellish turn when the devilish Spike (Jeffrey Jones) turns up at the Knable house offering Roy a great deal on the ultimate satellite-TV system.Surprise, surprise: The contract signed by the less-than-cautious Roy  actually requires a one-time payment of his soul. He and Helen find  themselves sucked into their own television set, where they are kept on the run through such monstrous fare as \"I Love Lucifer\" and \"Northern Overexposure.\"  Eventually, their disenchanted kids (David Tom, Heather McComb) discover mom  and dad are on TV, in a whole new sense of the term, and they set about  rescuing them.A genuine novelty,Stay Tunedis powered along by a chain of  imaginative sequences, most memorably an original cartoon by Warner legend  Chuck Jones that cleverly integrates Ritter and Dawber's characters. The  script's implicit social satire about the overbearing nature of television on  underachieving lives isn't lost on the lively cast or director Peter Hyams  (Timecop), easily one of the most imaginative action filmmakers  around. The old rivalry between television and movies carries on in this  clever parody, and the feud has rarely been so much fun. With tons of  supporting players, including SCTV legend Eugene Levy,Saturday Night  Liveannouncer Don Pardo, and hip-hop performers Salt-n-Pepa.--Tom  Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007TKNEW", "B00LBHOCHS", "B000068MC4", "B00AEFXPG2", "6305433925", "B0006J28LE", "B002XUBDRY", "B0000WN0UU", "B00013WWT8", "6305162018", "B0009PVZCI", "B00008L3W3", "B0000CNY5P", "B00DJYKD0G", "B0000AUHQC", "B0000648ZQ", "B000067FP8", "B000BVM1R8", "B00005JKHX", "B002I41KNC", "B008FYZIYQ", "B00402FGB2", "B0001AW14C", "B0053TWVA0", "B00I2YXN5A", "0767804236", "B0002V7O3I", "B0012RWQJ8", "B002GOAH10", "1573624101", "B00K31RC20", "B005XB8SGO", "B003NH6FY2", "B003156II4", "B000F3UA8E", "B003PIUINI", "B00008979N", "0783225482", "B00005QCVN", "B009B8YNGO", "B000085EF5", "6305308888", "B00AEBB9E6", "B0000VV508", "B002NZK5TG", "B00HW3L9MG", "B00005V9HR", "B00005NKT5", "B0009UZG46", "B00000ILFQ", "B0071HPOHY", "B0091G7BTM", "B00IA1VKVY", "B0019ESNGO", "B0006J28MI", "B00008DDXK", "B001VNVB2G", "B00005T7I1", "B00C7A8WZQ", "B003IQ5YZE", "B005EKWZD6", "B00803PG80", "B0011367SY", "B00C3KTFVU", "B001Q8MMC4", "B000A7Q1UQ", "B000006FQS", "B0006J28LY", "B005DEUETU", "B003NNCLAS", "6305428549", "0790751445", "B0006J28LO", "B000063JDK", "B0009ML1Z2", "B000065V42", "B00079Z9Y6", "B004X63SKQ"], "bought_together": ["B0007TKNEW", "B002XUBDRY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007TKNEW", "B000068MC4", "B003NH6FY2", "B0000648ZQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 80477}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 49.99, "brand": "RITTER,JOHN", "asin": "B00004RF88", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QSWKCA4SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Stay Tuned"}

{"description": "\"I'm gonna scare the hell out of you,\" intones Stephen King in the trailer for his sole directorial effort, the much-malignedMaximum Overdrive. While the end result doesn't live up to that boast, this sci-fi/horror tale isn't as awful as it's been described. King's script (based on his short story \"Trucks\") focuses on the patrons of a North Carolina truck stop, which comes under attack by a convoy of trucks and other machines animated by Earth's passage through the tail of a \"rogue comet.\" King's fans, tired of half-baked screen adaptations likeCujoandChildren of the Corn, expected a horror home run fromMaximum Overdriveand instead got an old-fashioned drive-in movie filled with car crashes, cheapjack gore, and fart jokes. Needless to say, they stayed away in droves; the film's failure helped ruin producer Dino De Laurentiis's DEG Films and forced King to sheepishly claim that he had created a modern-dayPlan Nine from Outer Space. While the film is torpidly paced and often amateurishly acted, it's no worse than any direct-to-video thriller, and King's ear for dialogue occasionally shines through the gloom. Emilio Estevez and Pat Hingle register as a heroic cook and his black-hearted boss, respectively; the cast includes Yeardley Smith (Lisa Simpson's voice), Giancarlo Esposito, and Marla Maples (!) as a victim. Anchor Bay's letterboxed print is the R-rated theatrical version; the film was cut extensively after receiving an X rating for violence. The original trailer and a thorough biography on King are also included.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305120021", "B0002O7XW2", "B000G1R39E", "B0013527K2", "6305645574", "B00006FDCU", "B0030BOCL4", "B0001FVDQ4", "B006J8NPAE", "B00A1AU72A", "B00006FDCD", "B0002A2VK0", "B0007WFXNA", "B000053UIF", "B00005UQ9V", "6304936397", "B0000C2IQQ", "B000068IES", "B00AEBB91E", "B00BW4S87U", "B000063UR5", "1573625779", "B00JF5GAIW", "0792841328", "B000AYELI8", "B000U1ZV6W", "B00009OWI3", "B0010X73ZG", "B00AEBB91O", "1573626910", "B00005LQ0Q", "B00BTYPW7C", "0767821599", "B005CFBZVG", "B001DZOC64", "0783228686", "B0053TWVDC", "B00BW4S8AC", "B00AEFYV9W", "1573623911", "B00000F3SB", "B0052XU4BK", "0790742829", "B0053TWW9K", "B000063JDM", "B002KH4KSY", "B002NZK5SM", "B000GYI340", "B00AEFY37C", "B002WDR4AC", "B000063US5", "B0053TWV46", "B003L2M584", "B0007NFMB2", "B0002OXVG4", "B000069I05", "B00AEFXR8I", "B00AKGG828", "B00KW3A6KE", "B00005RDAI", "630523650X", "0792842960", "B008A1TUW0", "B002GHHHH4", "B0052SO0LK", "6304604572", "B0053TWVA0", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B0084MVE7E", "B000MDFTHE", "B00005K3NR", "B00008WT5J", "B00APQLJTA", "6305756430", "B00006CXGP", "6305238065", "B00AEFXPG2", "B000H4JH7Q", "B002GHHHG0", "B006BZ8NSE", "B0002V7O3I", "B004AC6PMG", "B002WJHBE0", "157362408X", "B005OK0YVG", "B0033HKCV4", "B008DL4KZY", "B00005N5RM", "B00BW4S89S", "B00006RCOC", "B003VA3JUO", "B005LS4MQY", "B00AEFY31S", "B005DL6PLY", "B00005O439", "B00JVQ7PWU", "B00GJNQ4M0", "B00009PY4C"], "bought_together": ["B0002O7XW2", "B0013527K2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002WDR4AC", "6305120021", "B0002O7XW2", "B00A1AU72A"]}, "price": 79.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 111118}, "asin": "B0000509C5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51M1301NVNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Maximum Overdrive"}
{"description": "Smart-talking American astronaut John Crichton (Ben Browder) is flung through a wormhole and comes out in the midst of an interstellar prison escape on the other side of the universe. Bad luck for Crichton: the galactic cops (called \"peacekeepers\") mark him as the new public enemy number 1. This 20th-century boy is forced to ally himself with the colorful convicts: D'Argo, a hulking warrior with a fleshy Rastafarian mane; Zhaan, a blue-skinned priest of indeterminate age (played byRoad Warrioralumnus Virginia Hey); fugitive peacekeeper Aeryn (Pitch Black's Claudia Black); Rygel, a greedy and troll-like exiled king; and Pilot, the giant insect-like nerve center of their living ship, Moya. It's an impressive-looking made-for-cable series, with imaginative production design and mix of state-of-the-art digital effects and sophisticated puppetry (or rather Muppetry, courtesy of co-creator Brian Henson), but it's the sharp writing and vivid characters that have built--and kept--the show's following.Premiereintroduces each character and the basic premise, a sci-fiFugitiveby way ofVoyagerin a world far from the Federation-friendly universe ofStar Trek. Crichton's welcome is anything but warm, and the cultural and philosophical differences of the fleeing outlaws, as well as their pure self-interest, clash under the constant threat of capture. InI, E.T., a hidden homing signal forces Moya to hide in a terrestrial bog while the crew tries to disarm the device (which has been fused to the ship's nervous system), and Crichton makes first contact with the planet's pre-space flight inhabitants. \"Spielberg was all wrong,\" he remarks while dodging military patrols and soothing the fears of a sky-watching scientist. Well-timed to fill the void left byBabylon 5, this is the promising start of a fresh sci-fi franchise.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000056VRD", "B0006FO9B0", "B00005AMQS", "B00005M91F", "B00005NVHT", "B0000639E1", "B00005UO7R", "B00005R23R", "B00005MEUR", "B00000F6RL"], "bought_together": ["B000056VRD", "B0006FO9B0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002GP7ZWI", "B002GP7ZV4", "B0006FO9B0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 366079}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "", "asin": "B0000541X6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZT8EF046L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Farscape Season 1, Vol. 1 - Premiere/I, E.T."}

Shot on location in a small town in Missouri, where he  and his crew faced bigotry first hand when the locals found out exactly what  they were actually shooting, the film went on to win rave reviews and film  festival prizes and became Corman's first film to lose money. William Shatner  delivers the most controlled performance of his career as Adam Cramer, a cool,  charismatic white supremacist who rouses the smoldering white citizens of a  small Southern town to mob violence on the eve of school integration. As the  crowd slips from his control and events escalate, Cramer's true intentions are  laid bare, and as he flails about in desperation Shatner's performance slides  into near hysteria. There are few weak performances in the smaller roles and the  film at times slips into didactic speeches, but Corman's strong direction drives  home the film in powerful scenes and striking imagery: Cramer's incendiary  speech on the courthouse steps, the deathly quiet KKK ride through the black  part of town. By the climax Corman understands that controlled silence is even  more terrifying than a mob's thundering cries.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007R4T3A", "B000059OLR", "B00465I1BK", "B000FNNHVQ", "B00H7BJ0C4", "B006QS9MKE", "B00D9EJFV4", "B00K31RBYY", "1419706691", "B000EHSVJG", "B00008W2SL", "B00317LM92", "B000E991S4", "B00HRISNPM", "B000059TOB", "B00DOZNI8Y", "B0000A0DTC", "B0034PWPHY", "B004AZ7ZLI", "B004Y2AE1A", "B000EJ2TGU", "B00009PY4A", "B000M9BSBO", "B00IP965IO", "B000GIW964", "B0039BEEWW", "6305869367", "B0009VV6RQ", "B008XTVWHK", "6305944288", "B003XKNGMS", "B000UDGOBG", "B00EFYB03S", "B008UFUL6K", "B00005AUK1", "B000EHSVJ6", "B00IVLRC6K", "B005AMJ3B0", "B002WJHBDG", "B000C20VNM", "B000051S7L", "B00997H1VQ", "B0081AWUVI", "B002NN7EY2", "B00CG4XKSM", "B0007R4T26", "B00BCMT1I2", "B00DOZNGC2", "B00HVOFP12", "B00C81AW66", "B000AC7P5Q", "B00I116MVQ", "B00B94VJYW", "B0007R4T1C", "1606730266", "B00CP6YNDM", "B00JQP111W", "B0006J2G9I", "B00D9EJFZA", "B000G8NXP0", "B000XJD34I", "B004ZKKL0A", "B00GOT15IM", "B0002RUPH4", "B0000089JE", "B00358MG8S", "B00023P4UQ", "B0024FAG80", "B005TMY00K", "B007KW5NG2", "B00ARWX9NG", "B00H7BJ1I2", "B00H7BJ0WO", "B00C7E3EDW", "B00F6D62O4", "B000NO23T4", "B00005N7Z3", "B0053TWW9K", "B0000A2ZSS", "B0009X770E", "B00BYGTN7A", "B000K0YM18", "B007ZFSBWW", "B00027JYBW", "B006ZUMNPY", "B00I3C1T7A", "B0042FUHUM", "B000096I9Q", "B00005V9HD", "B00B2M7DKA", "B00A3V2JPA", "B00B0LKVIY", "B008XB2UCE", "B004NJC0J8", "0199925674", "B0038SUBEG", "B00E0FW0M2", "B000EHSVRI", "B00BNAE1IS", "B005TMXZSI"], "bought_together": ["B0007R4T3A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FNNHVQ", "B0007WQHI0", "B000GIW964", "B000EJ2TGU"]}, "price": 14.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 184499}, "asin": "B000058TIM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MZAJNME8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Intruder (40th Anniversary Edition)"}

{"description": "By its third season,The X-Fileshad grown from a cult hit to a global phenomenon, becoming the most popular show in many countries outside the U.S. Armed with the knowledge that the show was here to stay, series creator Chris Carter expanded its mythology, and the 24 episodes in this boxed set represent arguably the strongest of all theX-Filesseasons. As usual, stand-alone episodes explored the paranormal and sometimes terrifying possibilities in mythology, pop culture, and religion. Darin Morgan helps the show to mature by expanding its use of humor, directing classic episodes such as \"Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose\" (featuring a fabulous performance from Peter Boyle) and \"Jose Chung's 'From Outer Space.'\" Meanwhile, two-part episodes continue to delve into theX-Filesown mythology, introducing the alien black oil, the implant in Scully's neck, the mysterious Agent X, and the shape-shifting Jeremiah Smith. But following the complex mythology is not crucial to enjoying the show. The strength of theX-Fileslies not in resolution but in feeding the paranoia of its rabid audience by revealing conspiracies that linger in the mind as unanswered questions. Series creator Carter realized wisely that fans did not look to theX-Filesto explain the unexplained, but to question that which they thought they understood. The third season was effective because it hinted that while the truth was out there, it was more complex, sinister, and amazing than even Mulder had imagined.Commentaries and deleted scenes are available for some of the 24 episodes, and the last disc in the set contains numerous TV spots and interviews with the creators about the filming of the third season.--Eugene Wei", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000CNE0SS", "B000BOH98G", "B000CNE0T2", "B000BOH986", "B000CNE0TC", "B000EXDS34", "B000EXDS3E", "B000EXDS3Y", "B0007X7044", "B001G7PSZI", "B001FACH7S", "B0006UEVUE", "B001CY5N00", "B003V1IU3O", "B00005JA9M", "B00465I156", "B0009X76XW", "B0081QF6Q8", "B00133QNSG", "B000CQM4YM", "B000I0QLRS", "B000I0QLR8", "B00133QNRW", "0061686174", "B00008KA59", "B00FXW9664", "B000I0QLRI", "B000O77SMW", "B004X60QE2", "B000SULWKO", "B004V2S4SS", "B0006UEVTK", "B0007UDCX0", "B00FWMVVKY", "B002ZCY872", "B0000AOX0C", "B002CLKP00", "B001A9ZRLC", "B000667HBS", "B00J5JSV1W", "B001G7PT4I", "B003BV8I7C", "B000244E2O", "B008412UKA", "B000I0QLS2", "B00133QNS6", "B003K2G0TA", "B00B5ARKC0", "B002UOMGWO", "B00JF5GAZA", "B001ASIHZG", "B00FWMVVHC", "B001S86J3K", "B001G0MFIS", "B00FWMVVI6", "B0002NY81C", "B00IYMSMTM", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B000A88EU0", "B000FOPPBA", "B00IQ8TT82", "B000W4KT9G", "B0024FAR66", "B000N2HD6O", "B002VA5A02", "B003R0MF1W", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B0012018OE", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00H4ZEJ6K", "B002AK9UPO", "B004XQO90O", "B0007CNY4K", "B002U0KHME", "B00I4581F4", "B000NOKFH6", "B00005Y1NF", "B00EIXWW2O", "B00K0MM4AM", "B0001K5GOO", "B000AJJNFE", "B007XF0XVQ", "B000NOIX66", "B0028ZDJF8", "B00CDAG0WW", "B000BUE5DC", "B0085KGGTQ", "B005FISBTO", "B001CQONKY", "B001DPHDBU", "B001F7Q4JS", "B003TNW030", "B00HUPC5X8", "B00BTYNXJG", "B000I0QLQY", "B003R0MEYA", "B000LXGXY8", "B00GT2TEPU", "B002WC89WK", "B00CRX82LM"], "bought_together": ["B000BOH98G", "B000CNE0SS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BOH98G", "B000BOH986", "B000CNE0SS", "B000CNE0T2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 165123}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 49.89, "brand": "", "asin": "B000059TQ9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513WHGPZ5ML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The X-Files - The Complete Third Season"}
{"description": "AlthoughSunshinewas made by a Hungarian, Istv&aacute;n Szab&oacute;, and deals with the history of Hungary as refracted through three generations of a Jewish-Hungarian family, you might be more inclined to give it three hours of your own life if you approach it as a David Lean movie in spirit. Itisan English-language picture, and Maurice Jarre's music recalls his score forDoctor Zhivago. Szab&oacute; emulates Lean's intimate-epic style of merging the sweep of history with the crystalline detailing of individual lives, so that the shape of destiny is glimpsed through personal moments that feel at once evanescent and eternal. His lighting cameraman, Lajos Koltai, is one of the handful of cinematographers equal to capturing these moments in lapidary images--cinematic sunshine of the highest order.\"Sunshine\" is a literal translation of Sonnenschein, the family name of the central characters. And \"destiny\" is one meaning of Sors, the name three Sonnenschein offspring choose for themselves to better assimilate as subjects of the Austro-Hungarian empire. Two are brothers, Ignatz (Ralph Fiennes) and Gustave (James Frain); their sister (by adoption) Valerie (Jennifer Ehle) is really their cousin. Both men love her, and Ignatz rocks the ultratraditional family by taking her as his wife. Nevertheless, the Sonnenscheins and the Sors enter upon the 20th century in loving solidarity, grateful to live under a liberal and tolerant regime. That's all swept away by the Great War, the rise of Nazism, and its replacement, the new fascism of Stalinist Communism. Valerie survives them all--though she's played later on by Rosemary Harris, Ehle's own mother. For his part--or parts--Ralph Fiennes goes on to embody two later generations of Sonnenschein/Sors men, the proudly patriotic Adam and his son, the rudderless Ivan, whose guilt over being a compliant prisoner at Auschwitz leads him to buy into the passionate puritanism of the Stalinist purges. Fiennes rises to the awesome challenge of creating three utterly distinct characters who all share the same congenital weaknesses and aching potential for greatness.This is a film of considerable beauty and sometimes shattering power. Even three hours is not enough to do justice to all the characters, all the wrenching turnarounds of history and political allegiance and rectitude. But the film is never less than gripping, and as an essay on \"family values,\" it's well-nigh definitive.--Richard T.

Now, as Maud and Roland embark on a wildly romantic journey in search of the truth, the mystery of the past will engulf them, as the passions of the present possess them.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SUDQ22", "B000BOH904", "0679735909", "B00AEBB8P6", "B001RJ1Y62", "B004SIP7AS", "6305692696", "B000JJ5G4W", "B00I6JODGO", "B00005JOA0", "B002AT8KAG", "B006YTGL3G", "B004XVMCMQ", "B00005JMJD", "B00HUAGZ34", "0767812115", "0800141660", "B00005ALMM", "B000ZS8GW6", "B000Z27HLS", "B002ZFEQ76", "B004499LWG", "B005T0OY5S", "B004SIP9U6", "B00005OBAL", "0788815490", "B004SIP7D0", "B000EBD9VC", "B004SEUIZG", "B00006FD9P", "B000784WNQ", "B000N4SHOE", "B000EDWLTQ", "B004P7CNZO", "B00003JRCQ", "B0080QOL10", "B004AE3QYE", "B00AF82WTO", "B004U7MQZ6", "B00G6HO368", "B00005LOKU", "B006YTGL86", "B00F1BFRA6", "B0001US61O", "B0064MT1U8", "B005CFC0HE", "B004BZ5AGY", "B004P7CMUU", "B004SIP8JI", "0790730979", "0767020308", "B0018M6J90", "B000F3UAFC", "B00005JPSM", "B000LPQ6DE", "B001C4AFOY", "B0000372I3", "B004JMSIQS", "0767847415", "B006GL8NTW", "B002WY65VA", "0767806786", "B007A2O3FO", "B00GS08Y3Q", "B0001US7Q8", "B0000AQS3P", "0767815718", "B00023BKO0", "B00062IZ0Y", "0826452485", "B000E1ZBGS", "B00B89WZG4", "B000BITVAG", "B0045O2PHS", "B00AZMFO6I", "B00CIOD6HK", "0790732947", "B0080QOL1A", "B004QDRW0S", "B00JAQJMJ0", "0679738290", "B002I5GNZQ", "B0000844LU", "B003EA45EA", "B0007NFLO0", "B009T6CXG0", "B000CEV3M8", "B000M2E32M", "B00005YUNK", "B000NOIX48", "B000085OY1", "B00004WI57", "B00003CXC9", "B00AKGG6JS", "B001L57ZZG", "B004EQAVHI", "B0001GOH7K", "0783239416", "B00G7QPXAI", "B0046ZYEUW"], "bought_together": ["B000BOH904", "B00AEBB8P6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0679735909", "B000BOH904", "B00AEBB8P6", "B004SUDQ22"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 39150}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.41, "brand": "PALTROW,GWYNETH", "asin": "B00005JKKY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51220SPRBNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Possession"}
{"description": "Heavy on atmosphere and light on everything else,From Hellis visually impressive while lacking the depth of the acclaimed graphic novel it's based upon. Making their third feature since 1993'sMenace II Society, twins Allen and Albert Hughes approach the Jack the Ripper case with physical precision, re-creating the gritty Whitechapel district of 1888 London in meticulous detail. What they've forgotten is the sheer terror that gripped Whitechapel in the wake of the Ripper's slaying of five prostitutes, investigated here by a Scotland Yard sleuth (Johnny Depp) who uses opium, laudanum, and absinthe to fuel his semiprescient visions of the slayings. Heather Graham attempts a slippery Cockney accent as a would-be victim, while Ian Holm steals the show as a has-been surgeon with devilish delusions of grandeur. Violence is obliquely suggested or briefly graphic, but no matter how you cut it,From Hellis only marginally thrilling as it treads familiar territory.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBBA72", "B000NQRR1Q", "B004P7CNC2", "B00005R87R", "B000F7CECK", "B00AEBBAEK", "B00000IRE6", "B002QEHPQU", "B0002234LS", "B008QE9XD2", "B0000VD04M", "B0009UZG0K", "0780621611", "B006ISJQ1W", "B004SIP7PS", "B0000AC8LI", "B00347AIOE", "B00003CXWV", "B003HKN52U", "B001HN69AY", "B000053VAZ", "B000TGJ80S", "B0012Q7M02", "B00AEBB9F0", "B002Q3MYA8", "B00C888MJ8", "B00004XPPB", "B000FDEV3Y", "0780628551", "0783229526", "B001HN694K", "B0000WN140", "B0009IOR6Q", "B00F84H73Q", "B00003CXRG", "B001GCUO0W", "B004A8ZWSS", "B004SIP6BI", "B00004W4UB", "B000N2HDJQ", "B000C3L27U", "B000GCFO0I", "B000BB1MI2", "B005S9EJ8W", "B0009XRZKQ", "B00AEBB89W", "B008R65Y28", "B001I04QCO", "B00008LUNW", "B00005JLKN", "B003Y5H54W", "B0012QE4Q2", "B00DZP1C2W", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00JPFTX5O", "B0000TPA0G", "B001AGXEAG", "B0041KKYEM", "B00J5JSV3A", "B000069I1I", "B002UOMH00", "B004SIP92O", "B001A50716", "B005LAIHYU", "B0002KVUKM", "B005COPWZW", "B0036BDQ7Y", "B000UJ48P4", "B004SIP7TE", "B0031U8OEK", "0783116934", "B005LAIHXQ", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B000063US5", "B00005JLQN", "B00DHD933W", "B002AF4Y9G", "B000LP6KNU", "B008JFUNYG", "B0021L8V34", "B001D2WU9I", "B007XF0W3K", "B003AWRMBU", "B00009MEKN", "B00HRCATDW", "B0020PFYHC", "B00003CXKM", "B004SUDQ4A", "B0010DR4BO", "B0097C046W", "B00IKM5LXG", "B000FAOC2W", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00K6D1RVW", "B002ZG97CO", "B00151QYXU", "B005LAIH2C", "6301971345", "6304712499", "B003H5WF3U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBBA72", "B004P7CNC2", "B00005R87R", "B000NQRR1Q"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 164982}, "asin": "B00005JKJM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/418JG1F78JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "From Hell (Two-Disc Special Edition)"}

{"description": "WithThe Return of the King, the greatest fantasy epic in film history draws to a grand and glorious conclusion. Director Peter Jackson's awe-inspiring adaptation of the Tolkien classicThe Lord of the Ringscould never fully satisfy those who remain exclusively loyal to Tolkien's expansive literature, but as a showcase for physical and technical craftsmanship it is unsurpassed in pure scale and ambition, setting milestone after cinematic milestone as the brave yet charmingly innocent Hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood) continues his mission to Mordor, where he is destined to destroy the soul-corrupting One Ring of Power in the molten lava of Mount Doom. While the heir to the kingdom of Men, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), endures the massive battle at Minas Tirith with the allegiance of the elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom), dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and the great wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), Frodo and stalwart companion Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) must survive the schizoid deceptions of Gollum, who remains utterly convincing as a hybrid of performance (by Andy Serkis) and subtly nuanced computer animation.Jackson and cowriters Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens have much ground to cover; that they do so with intense pacing and epic sweep is impressive enough, but by investing greater depth and consequence in the actions of fellow Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), they ensure thatReturn of the Kingmaintains the trilogy's emphasis on intimate fellowship. While several major characters appear only briefly, and one (Christopher Lee's evil wizard, Saruman) relegated entirely to the extended version on DVD, Jackson is to be commended for his editorial acumen; like Legolas the archer, his aim as a filmmaker is consistently true, and he remains faithful to Tolkien's overall vision. IfReturnsuffers from too many endings, as some critic suggested, it's only because the epic's conclusion is so loyally inclusive of the actors--most notably Astin--who gave it such strength to begin with. By ending theLOTRtrilogy with noble integrity and faith in the power of imaginative storytelling,The Return of the King, like its predecessors, will stand as an adventure for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B002ZG980U", "B002PMV9FG", "B008UZA8FY", "B001NGML48", "B00005JM5E", "B001GZ6QC4", "B005COPWZW", "B008M4C1EO", "B00HFFE8HE", "039548930X", "B000W7F5SS", "B000I0RQVI", "B002VWNIDG", "B000E6EK2Y", "B001BYMX4A", "B004M1A21K", "B007K3JFUQ", "B001DHXT20", "B001UV4XHY", "0345325818", "B003Y5H54W", "B00005JNJV", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000A3XY5A", "B004LWZWGA", "B000U7WV1Y", "B005LXQLRW", "B001OQCV6A", "B000E8M0VA", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000EHRVMY", "0618640150", "B003ZK99NQ", "B0013FDM7E", "B00005JPH2", "B000UNYK4E", "B009JBWOU0", "B00003CX5P", "B00008G8M5", "B00GKOJ98E", "B004LWZW42", "B000H30B2C", "B000P0J0C4", "B00CZDLGDU", "B000M341QE", "B00008G8M4", "B000FKO5QK", "B00HWWUQYY", "B007SPPANM", "B008JFUO72", "B001DJLD1M", "0345538374", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00005JKCH", "B004SIP9U6", "B000YGGNMO", "B00E5I2M9K", "0618126988", "B005OCFGTO", "B00E8S2JZ4", "6305313687", "B004AKCME8", "B0002KVUKM", "B000AARKOO", "B0006GAO5Y", "B000K7VHQ4", "B002ZG997C", "B00AHTYI5M", "B008JFUS0U", "B0042MEQVG", "B00275EGWY", "B00E9PMML2", "B008UZDXEW", "B004SIP7F8", "B00116GEJS", "B00003CXI1", "B003ZKBELG", "B003Y5H5EW", "B000V4UFZK", "B0007PLLBU", "B001DTPZNY", "B002O3Z50Q", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000LP6KNU", "B005G4TJUC", "B00AW0KHTM", "B002ZG97YM", "054792819X", "B00AEFXZJE", "B0000YEEGM", "B002IPFWTE", "B001ECQ75A", "B000065U1N", "B0051MKNV8", "B000W796OM", "B00J49R1BY"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HFFE8HE", "B00003CWT6", "B00005JKZV", "B00BEZTMFY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1589}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JKZY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HS7iSFv5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)"}
{"description": "The setup is promising: The Romano mob family know that they're being betrayed by a hidden FBI informant in their ranks, so they decide to send a family member under cover to destroy the evidence against them--but the only family member the FBI won't recognize is the family black sheep, Corky (Chris Kattan), a touchy-feely aspiring veterinarian. But once Corky goes undercover, his klutzy ways accidentally make him the star of the FBI, sparking envy from his fellow agents and arousing suspicion in the mob. Though the script ofCorky Romanodeclines as the movie goes on, Kattan actually keeps the picture going; his spastic, sniveling, childish energy is engaging, and at its best the production bubbles over with silliness. It only falls flat when Kattan has to behave in a remotely adult manner, which fortunately doesn't happen very often. Cheerful dopiness.

{"description": "South African director Jamie Uys caught lightning in a bottle withThe Gods Must Be Crazy--a Coke bottle, to be specific. This slaphappy collection of goofy pratfalls and culture-clash gags became an enormous international smash, and made a sort of star out of the Bushman selected to play the central role, the completely ingratiating N!Xau. He plays a man, unaware of white culture, who finds a Coca-Cola bottle in the Kalahari (dropped by a passing pilot) and promptly has his life turned around by this mystical object. The movie looks slipshod and even amateurish at times, yet its attitude is so bubbly it's hard to resist. Proving that physical comedy remains a true international language, millions of moviegoers around the world drank it up.The Gods Must Be Crazy II(1989) returns N!Xau to the bizarre world of the white man, this time in a slicker plot (and a with a bigger budget) that, perhaps predictably, yields fewer real belly laughs than the first time around. Director Jamie Uys sticks to his cherished notions that tribesmen are wiser than civilized people, and that fast-motion comedy is inherently funny. The storyline begins with N!Xau's innocent Bushman searching for his lost children; he then gets sidetracked by subplots. The humor is basic, but in best silent-movie tradition Uys prepares his set-pieces with elaborate care, and he understands the value of the long-delayed pay-off.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005R2SHQA", "B000089736", "B00CCF7NW4", "B005GRF3DG", "B000244F9G", "B004SUDQ3Q", "B004SG6B14", "B0000B1OEO", "0783230532", "B00ALTQRRK", "B0006B2A7E", "B00006FDAX", "0783240171", "B000063JDF", "B000G6BLWE", "B000056HEH", "B002VWNIBI", "B0009H97H6", "B0002J4X2U", "0780621611", "B00005NRN8", "B00000ING2", "B001DDBD4K", "B00K6D1QV8", "B0009RCPWK", "6305428360", "B00005N5SA", "B00DJYKD0G", "B0000AK7AB", "B00AEFY5GQ", "B0000633U5", "0783232047", "B00824FK9W", "B00AEFXD1O", "B009YX8MSG", "6304712936", "B005E7SFK6", "B00008CMSX", "B002I2PHXI", "B0006FFRB6", "B005JJCMNU", "B000Q66Q92", "B0002KPHYC", "B0016LFG24", "B002M2Z3BA", "B00005N5SB", "B007N31YH0", "B004LWZW7E", "B001IHJ988", "B004N66XZ8", "B000059H9D", "B002VWNIAY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00AEFY08O", "B00005LOL0", "B0001I55P6", "B00006LPGP", "B002LII6PU", "0783225547", "B00005Y71F", "B00C3ALLFS", "B0082SIAD6", "B004RUF9DC", "B000TXP56C", "B00407PNY2", "B00H83EUQW", "B00F84H73Q", "B00000K4ES", "B00003CXC3", "B000HT3PGU", "B0007ZEOD2", "B0009UVCR6", "B00005TN8K", "B00003CXJ4", "B008JFUS0U", "B005BYBZKY", "B00DOZNJWO", "B00AEFY3MC", "B000W1SZBS", "B00GSTHCHQ", "B008JFURII"], "bought_together": ["B005R2SHQA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00CCF7NW4", "B005R2SHQA", "B00JQHOIII", "B00005N5SA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 27296}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 79.0, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00005JKU7", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WC910BG2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Gods Must Be Crazy Series (The Gods Must Be Crazy / The Gods Must Be Crazy II)"}
{"description": "It's not that the folks at Pixar are geniuses when it comes to DVDs... well, come to think of it, their fifth DVD set shows these folks are wizards. It's not just that the two discs are packed with watchable extras that hardly reiterate the same information; it's how they are handled--funny, inventive, with a light touch--unlike many PR-driven discs. A good place to start is the filmmakers' jolly commentary track, which branches off into 31 minutes of behind-the-scene stuff, deleted scenes, and curious anecdotes (they can also be watched separately). Pixar's first making-of documentary is a most concise and interesting 25-minute examination that also sheds light on how the company works. With a digital-to-digital transfer, the film looks great and is available in widescreen or reformatted to full screen. The \"Family Fun\" disc includes another Pixar made-for-the-DVD gem, the 7-minute \"Exploring the Reef\" with Jean-Michel Cousteau (Jacques's son) being upstaged by Dori and Marlin; it's a hoot and teaches a fact or two you will remember about reefs. Both discs feature lovely menus that can be turned into virtual aquariums for your TV (by removing the text) featuring the knockout colors of the film's settings. Watch long enough for some shenanigans from the film's characters and vocal talent.

The bonus features are much more generous than the offerings on previousStar Trektheatrical films other than the two-disc special editions.  There are four featurettes (46 minutes total) discussing the casting of Shinzon, development of the story line, shooting the action scenes, and the themes of family and change that run through the film.  Director Stuart Baird contributes a commentary track that is a bit dry and sometimes silent.  He mentions how he's not aTrekinsider and that because he was working in an established setting he didn't have the freedom of creation that directors usually do.  He also discusses the mechanics of shooting and points out where certain scenes were shortened or eliminated.  Seven of the cut scenes appear on the DVD, some introduced by Baird or Patrick Stewart.

{"description": "For Baby Boomers, owning a season or two of a fondly remembered TV series on DVD is enough to satisfy any nostalgic yearnings.The Man From U.N.C.L.E., though, warrants the full-series treatment. It's a wild '60s flashback to the Espionage era that was ushered in by Ian Fleming's James Bond adventures. According to a series retrospective that's just one of this cleverly packaged set's prodigious extras, Fleming himself was recruited to create a spy series for American television. His contribution was the name \"Napoleon Solo,\" the moniker of a crime boss inGoldfinger. That movie, which would kick Bond and spy mania into overdrive, had not yet opened when viewers were introduced to Robert Vaughn's Solo and David McCallum's Illya Kuryakin, agents of the United Network Command for Law and Enforcement. This covert agency operated out of Del Floria's Tailor Shop in New York under the command of true Brit Alexander Waverly (Leo J. Carroll, playing much the same character he portrayed inNorth by Northwest).The Man from U.N.C.L.E.offered a bit of hope in Cold War America that an American and Russian could work together to stop a common enemy, THRUSH, a ruthless organization bent on world domination. The intriguing conceit ofThe Man From U.N.C.L.E.was to give audiences an empathetic surrogate who would be plucked from their humdrum lives for whirlwind adventures with Solo and Kuryakin. In the pilot episode, Patricia Crowley guest-stars as a housewife who acts as bait to foil the plans of her former college boyfriend, who is plotting the assassination of a world leader. In a series benchmark, \"The Never-Never Affair,\" a pre-Get SmartBarbara Feldon stars as an U.N.C.L.E. translator who unwittingly becomes involved in actual espionage. Seasons one and two are the series' best, with a stellar roster of guest stars (\"The Project Strigas Affair\" features the first onscreen pairing of William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy), stylish direction by directors who would go on to some renown (Michael Ritchie, Richard Donner), smart scripts, and great action (a movie theatre shoot-out in \"The Never-Never Affair\"). In its third season,The Man From U.N.C.L.E.adoptedBatman's campy and absurdist tone with shark-jumping results While this season has its share of groaners (in one episode, Sollo watusis with a gorilla), several \"Affairs\" stand out. Jack Palance and Janet Leigh as a long cool woman in a white dress are great villains in \"The Concrete Overcoat Affair.\" Harlan Ellison wrote the witty \"The Pieces of Fate Affair,\" in which he takes some sly digs at television and literary critics (a THRUSH operative is a book reviewer). Joan Collins makes like Eliza Doolittle in a dual role as a Bronx stripper and a countess in \"The Galatea Affair.\" The series went back to basics inSeason Four, but by then,The Avengerswas a bigger hit and the writing was on the wall for this once trendsetting series. This lavish box set affair contains upward of ten hours of bonus features, including the unaired series pilot, a series retrospective, an interview with a reunited Vaughn and McCallum, dossiers on each season's guest stars, one of theU.N.C.L.E.feature films edited and expanded from a two-part episode, segments about the great gadgets and cool music,U.N.C.L.E.designs and blueprints, and season-specific booklets.This definitive box set does full justice to a series that had such an impact on popular culture (as witness the bonus Tom & Jerry cartoon, \"The Mouse From H.U.N.G.E.R.\"). More than a blast from the past,The Man From U.N.C.L.E.is still a potent blend of \"cloak and swagger.\"--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001MVWMD4", "B005JJCMNU", "B009DA74CK", "B005JJCMO4", "B005DKS1Z8", "B001CQONOA", "B00E5G03I4", "B005JJCMPI", "B00CPTUNR4", "B00IU6HQ4O", "B001E0O8DA", "B005GYXN2M", "B000KLQUT4", "B001B0H7DG", "B00ESFUED6", "B00962R0H4", "B0014BQR3I", "B00EEEHL9G", "B00CPR3RB0", "B00EC9UHVM", "B001HUHBBS", "B00L1WJK2K", "B000BOH8Z0", "B008MIYKS0", "B000EXDS2A", "0312000529", "B008OIQYXM", "B00E96AY20", "B000FOQ03C", "B00L9K2EGS", "B002L9N4O2", "B00IS6WQ2S", "B00IXPWGIS", "B008X8U83K", "B001DHXT6G", "B000K7VHYG", "B000HT3PF6", "B000GUJZ0U", "B009OE2ODY", "B000FFJ87Q", "B000EQ46HI", "B007ZR9H64", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B0012Z36FI", "B00GX7D5G0", "B00C7A8WWO", "B003NOGNQU", "B000N6UF10", "B000UX6TJI", "B000V3JGIS", "B00KDP31US", "B008NNY89A", "B0050MB5AC", "B00144P9RA", "B000BT96FA", "B00D9EJFQY", "B00KUS5YGC", "B001CDLATY", "B008RJ6TTC", "B002C68WOG", "B001DZOCZU", "B00I099JKA", "B00INMLUVU", "B00HMOWA0A", "B008TMISJ6", "B00D9EJFZA", "B00C10EG7A", "B00KTZALDC", "B003W5C0TY", "B00004Y2QO", "B008H6GHII", "B000HWZ4E8", "B00FUABJMS", "B001R1HEMI", "B00JK47BHM", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B00082ZROO", "B001JFKWE4", "B001MT7ZJC", "B00IXD2MU2", "B00DXLO0BI", "B0087GKHXO", "B00B00HUC0", "B008OR5X6M", "B000FI9OEK", "B001666484", "B00HSJ2CSE", "B003QS0E54", "B009TTGKS4", "B0096W46PS", "B00AML73BG", "B006BZ8NSE", "B0030E5PYO", "B003VJTGNE", "B00FNRA0KA", "B003XMKUEI", "B00BAXTYI0", "B0090EDEQE", "B000A5046K", "B003NKU9XM"], "bought_together": ["B005JJCMNU", "B001MVWMD4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00E5G03I4", "B001CQONOA", "B005JJCMNU", "B001MVWMD4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22598}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 135.28, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005JM5Z", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HwF-jpZtL._SX300_.jpg", "title": "The Man from U.N.C.L.E.: The Complete Series"}

{"description": "In terms of alluring female nudity,Swimming Poolshows a lot, but it's what remains concealed that gives this erotic thriller a potent, voyeuristic charge. With his Hitchcockian handling of secrets and lies, prolific French director Fran&#xE7;ois Ozon reunites with hisUnder the Sandstar, Charlotte Rampling, to tell a seductive tale of murder and complicity, beginning when British mystery novelist Sarah Morton (Rampling) seeks peace and relaxation at her publisher's French villa, only to find his brash, sexually liberated daughter Julie (Ludivine Sagnier) arriving shortly thereafter to disrupt her solitary reverie. What begins as mutual annoyance turns into something more sinister and duplicitous, alternating between Julie's predatory sex with men and Sarah's observant, perhaps jealous fascination.

{"description": "In the DVD world, the Criterion Collection label generally indicates that you'll be getting your money's worth on the extras, andThe Life Aquatic with Steve Zissouis no exception. These two discs contain many features that fans of the film will expect: Seu Jorge performing David Bowie songs (complete versions), many documentary scenes of writer-director Wes Anderson at work, interviews with cast members including Cate Blanchett, Bill Murray, etc. Other extras are a little more confusing. For instance, does Seymour Cassel, who plays Zissou's deceased partner, know what he's doing when he complains to a hairless cigar merchant about having to go faux bald? And what's the deal withMondo Monda? It's a cringingly awkward Italian talk show in which the host (also an actor in the film) interviews the screenwriters, throwing out references so random and esoteric that even smart guys like Anderson and Noah Baumbach are left speechless. It's all a joke, right? In the end, the bonus material accomplishes its primary goal: get those who already enjoy the film to like it just a little bit more.--Leah Weathersby", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0010X8NF0", "6305428239", "B0000640VJ", "0767821408", "B007L6VR12", "B001QOGYBI", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B007L6VR6M", "B000CS464G", "B0006TPE4C", "081099741X", "B00005JMJ4", "B000934FC2", "B0035G5IOE", "B00JAQJNN0", "B00005JMJG", "B000BRD6T4", "B0045NXMJE", "B00007AJF8", "B00H9HZITU", "B0018BD9DA", "B004SEUIXS", "1623160510", "B001P3SA8K", "B000JMK6LW", "B0018O4YT0", "B001MM3AZM", "B0006H32EI", "B002E2M5IC", "B0012E2GFK", "B000M4RG7E", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000Y7U98C", "B001NPD9PY", "B00IJXJAIS", "B000A7DVR2", "B008MIMWP8", "B004FQX5B6", "B00GKOJ98E", "0783228457", "B000K7VHOG", "B002LMV7RA", "B00008RH3J", "B0009A40ES", "B00DL46ZN8", "0957490909", "B000F5GNX8", "B00005JLRE", "B00006AUIH", "B00005V9HH", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B001JIE7JM", "B000IU37SO", "B004RQDQIQ", "B00AEBB8SS", "B00006LPGP", "B00000K3TS", "B00H9L28OO", "B007D5E7C2", "B000065AI3", "B0033WH6MW", "B008220D5K", "B0014D5RBE", "B001BPJJ9G", "B00005JL78", "B007D0FVRM", "B00AEFYOJE", "B00003CXZ4", "6304493681", "B0083V2W4U", "B000Z8GZYW", "B008R65XNS", "0783229526", "B00HGGUTPW", "B003UESJMO", "B005HK13SG", "B000P0J0EW", "B002VWNIAY", "B000P0J0D8", "B004SIP7ZS", "B001HN69AY", "B003XURDAY", "B00H7KJRVY", "B00ECR7KX2", "B001GMAVGE", "B005LAIIJY", "B000055Y0X", "B0000AC8LR", "B000K7VHQE", "B00AEFYAMA", "6305922756", "B0041T52S6", "B009YQJ322", "B003CRM6PA", "B002T9H2LA", "B000O76ZQC", "B0040QYROA", "B005MYEQ4U", "B00I6JOD2S", "B00FZ4KR4U"], "bought_together": ["B0010X8NF0", "B0000640VJ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00JAQJMJ0", "B0010X8NF0", "B007L6VR12", "B0000640VJ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 72305}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.5, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JNLQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H5Q2VBE1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (The Criterion Collection)"}
{"description": "The second DVD ofMillion Dollar Babyoffers just under an hour of bonus material.  In the 19-minute \"Born to Fight,\" the cast discusses women boxers.  It's fairly routine, except that cast member Lucia Rijker, who played Billie the Blue Bear, is a real-life boxer some of whose experiences mirrored those of Maggie Fitzgerald in the film.  There's also 13 minutes of interviews with the film's producers, and a 24-minute roundtable in which James Lipton interviews Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank, and Morgan Freeman.  All displaying their Oscar statuettes, they discuss Eastwood's directorial style, the craft of acting, and Freeman's dance background.  For whatever reason, throughout the bonus features the central issue of the film's final act is briefly acknowledged, but not discussed.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003ASLJO0", "B003ASLJQS", "B000ARTN3I", "B003AWRMCE", "B001P9KR8U", "B000A3XY5A", "B000M341QE", "B004SIP8ZM", "B003AWRMBA", "B00275EGWY", "B003ASLJJU", "B00782O7IY", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00AEFY0F2", "B004EQAVA0", "B003AWRMC4", "B00011CZRE", "B00AHTYI5M", "B004SIP7ZS", "B003ASLJIQ", "B003UESJHO", "B003UESJH4", "B003ASLJOU", "B000P0J0EW", "B003AWRM9M", "B00AEFY5B6", "B009POCG2C", "B002VECM6S", "B00AEFXVOI", "B003ASLJS6", "B000P0J0EM", "B00388PK7O", "B003AWRMA6", "B004SIP7VM", "B003ASLJKE", "B004SIP7F8", "B003AWRM9W", "B00AEFXOKO", "B000055Y0Y", "B0001FVDJQ", "B004SIP9U6", "B0006GAO5Y", "B001FZQOW2", "B004FQX5B6", "B002JCSWV6", "B003LR5BD0", "B00AEFXESQ", "B001NFNFNU", "B004SIP7TE", "B003ASLJNQ", "B00AEBB8NI", "B004SEUJBE", "B003ASLJMW", "B002ZG99N6", "B00003CWN3", "B000P0J09M", "B00005JKWX", "B00B0U2SFE", "B00009N83V", "B004SIP95G", "B000YAF4MA", "B000N6U0E2", "B0006GAOJA", "B00005JKMQ", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0006HBV3W", "B003AWRMBU", "B002VWNIEA", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B001BL96K2", "B0000YEEGM", "B00AEFXKUI", "B0015XHQT4", "B00001ZWUS", "B000BYA4HE", "B00005JMCN", "B000683VI4", "B000MZHW40", "B00004BZIY", "B002VWNIBI", "B002Z7FWBI", "B003ASLJRC", "B000XR9L50", "B00005JLSB", "B00012FXJ0", "B00AEFYSWM", "B000KJTGHO", "B002CPMB9O", "B0009S4IKQ", "0783225725", "B00005JN0W", "B0060ZJ7BC", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00005JPBO", "6305313687", "6305212112", "B00K2CHUWW", "B00003CXCF", "0767802519", "B003ASLJK4"], "bought_together": ["B003ASLJO0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000ARTN3I", "B00003CXNY", "B009JBWOU0", "B003AWRMCE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 90739}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JNP1", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41yRyrBhN-L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Million Dollar Baby (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}

Now, you can always choose to watchMadagascarwith the informative commentary from directors Tom McGrath and Eric Darnell. But, given the option to watch the film with the one and only \"Penguin Chat\" feature length commentary, which are you going to choose-- the penguins or the filmmakers? Also included is the 10-minute animated short \"The Penguins in a Christmas Caper.\" As the penguins prepare to celebrate Christmas they notice that Private (Christopher Knights) is missing. Never to leave one behind, Skipper (Tom McGrath) and the gang are off to rescue the young penguin, and as imagined, destructive and mischievous humor ensues.  Not surprisingly, most of the extras on this DVD are geared toward kids. There is a plethora of games and activities included that are more silly and fun, then educational. But then again no one ever saidMadagascarwasMutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom.

{"description": "More than a few critics hailedSpider-Man 2as \"the best superhero movie ever,\" and there's no compelling reason to argue--thanks to a bigger budget, better special effects, and a dynamic, character-driven plot, it's a notch aboveSpider-Manin terms of emotional depth and rich comic-book sensibility.Ordinary PeopleOscar-winner Alvin Sargent received screenplay credit, and celebrated author and comic-book expert Michael Chabon worked on the story, but it's director Sam Raimi's affinity for the material that bringsSpidey 2to vivid life. When a fusion experiment goes terribly wrong, a brilliant physicist (Alfred Molina) is turned into Spidey's newest nemesis, the deranged, mechanically tentacled \"Doctor Octopus,\" obsessed with completing his experiment and killing Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) in the process. Even more compelling is Peter Parker's urgent dilemma: continue his burdensome, lonely life of crime-fighting as Spider-Man, or pursue love and happiness with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst)? Molina's outstanding as a tragic villain controlled by his own invention, and the action sequences are nothing less than breathtaking, but the real success ofSpider-Man 2is its sense of priorities. With all of Hollywood's biggest and best toys at his disposal, Raimi and his writers stay true to the Marvel mythology, honoringSpider-Mancreators Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, and setting the bar impressively high for the challenge ofSpider-Man 3.--Jeff ShannonDVD Features:The first commentary track is by director Sam Raimi and a self-deprecating Tobey Maguire speaking in tandem, and producer (and Marvel CEO) Avi Arad and coproducer Grant Curtis speaking in tandem. They discuss a number of topics, including Raimi's memory of his excitement over Richard Donner's Superman and how the character of Black Cat had to be dropped from the film. The second commentary is by six members of the Oscar-nominated effects team, and one of their primary focuses is how Doc Ock's arms were achieved by a combination of puppetry and CGI.The centerpiece of the second disc is a massive two-hour documentary that can be viewed all at once or in 12 separate pieces. It covers the development of the story, the visual effects, costumes, stunts, and sound and music. Three shorter featurettes cover Peter Parker's struggle between his personal and hero lives, Doc Ock, and the women in Spider-Man's life, and what's interesting is how they discuss those topics not just in relation to the movies but to the comic books as well. (For example, Betty Brant and Gwen Stacy had a much greater impact in the comics.) There's a scene in which you can toggle among three different camera angles, and a gallery of 17 paintings Alex Ross created for the opening sequence. The sound and picture are spectacular, though only theSuperbit editionhas DTS.--David HoriuchiMore Spiderman on DVDTheSpidermanToy StoreThe First FilmSpider Manon the small screenThe SoundtrackGame Boy AdvanceThe BookMore Superheroes on DVDBatmanBladeThe HulkJimmy NeutronJustice LeagueKim PossibleRobocopSpider-ManSupermanWonder WomanX-MenAlso see our Action & Adventure StoreStills fromSpider-Man 2(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000UR9T8C", "B00005JKCH", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00005JNTU", "B000VI70QS", "B001CDR1FG", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000AYELVA", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000AYELVU", "B008JFUO72", "B0083SBMBM", "B004LWZW42", "B004EPZ07K", "B00005JNJV", "B0002IQMAM", "B00E5I2MEK", "B000OVLBF8", "B00E5I2M9K", "B000HEVZ9E", "B008QZ5PY2", "B000HCO83Q", "B00JPS7HOA", "B001QB9H1U", "B00IGVJGYQ", "B0000959N0", "B0007P0Y7C", "B002GSXKN8", "B008JFUPFI", "B000J10EQU", "B0007V6ITE", "B0090SI56Y", "B001GZ6QC4", "6307397594", "B008JFUS0U", "B000IJ79VQ", "B000VR0570", "B002ZG99B8", "B00005JKWJ", "B004LWZWGA", "B005G4TJUC", "B002IPFWTE", "B00005JM5E", "B005LAIGW8", "0767817478", "B000H30B2C", "B002A5EBLW", "B0006L0LOS", "B000U7WV1Y", "B0000VCZLG", "B000P0J06K", "B002GSXKNI", "B002HWRYJE", "B0004Z33EQ", "B0009A409S", "B001DJLD2G", "B000I0RQVI", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B0007RT9MG", "B001GKJ2E8", "B0000AXE8I", "B007K3JFUQ", "B00004STUL", "B00BEZTMFY", "B000P0J06U", "B000957O82", "1402778007", "B0039N74CW", "B003UESJF6", "B00F4FFO8E", "B001HN697M", "B001OST0LW", "B0060FXDCG", "B0049IHX2C", "B000P0J0A6", "B000CEVC9M", "B000UVKGPI", "B009JBWOU0", "B00005JM5B", "B00I6JOD2S", "B001EDVNNU", "B000O77SRC", "B0000633UA", "B000P6XQ50", "B000E8M0VA", "B00008G8M4", "B000EGDB10", "B007REV4T8", "B00BPA2PEI", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B005OY6LBE", "0780624890", "B002935GMS", "0767803434", "6305428042", "B000O78KW4", "B009HIKAN8"], "bought_together": ["B000UR9T8C", "B00005JKCH"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004LWZWFQ", "B003YAR97K", "B00005JKCH", "B000UR9T8C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9593}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.0, "brand": "Marvel Kids", "asin": "B00005JMQW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51529JJX43L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Spider-Man 2 (Widescreen Special Edition)"}
{"description": "Country boy Larry Wilcox got first billing, but Erik Estrada was the breakaway star ofCHiPs, the popular late 1970s show about California highway patrolmen. With his blindingly white teeth, tight shirts, tighter pants, and exquisite '70s hair (which always emerged from under his helmet perfectly coifed), Estrada transformed his struggling career of playing hoodlums into becoming one of television's first Latino heroes--Frank \"Ponch\" Poncharello--and a skyrocketing sex symbol as well.CHiPsis basicallyAdam-12on motorcycles. Ponch may have been a hothead, but there's not a hint that these cops are anything but perfectly upright and earnest in their duties--a far cry fromThe ShieldorThe Wire! Ponch and Jon Baker (Wilcox) cruise all over the southern California freeway system, grappling with car thieves, clearing away overturned trucks, and pulling beautiful girls out of car accidents. Every episode has at least one high-speed chase and just about every episode features Ponch hitting on a woman with gloriously feathered hair; watching episode after episode may feel a bit repetitive, but there's no denying that the stories are efficiently laid out and crisply executed. Foiling crime and rescuing lost dogs was the show's meat and potatoes, but the dessert was preposterousness like Ponch competing with a squad of middle-aged housewives on a game show or chasing after spilled chickens.

{"description": "One of the first things a viewer notices aboutCloverfieldis that it doesn't play by ordinary storytelling rules, making this intriguing horror film as much a novelty as an event. Told from the vertiginous point-of-view of a camcorder-wielding group of friends,Cloverfieldbegins like a primetime television soap opera about young Manhattanites coping with changes in their personal lives. Rob (Michael Stahl-David) is leaving New York to take an executive job at a company in Japan. At his goodbye party in a crowded loft, Rob&#x92;s brother Jason (Mike Vogel) hands a camcorder to best friend Hud (T.J. Miller), who proceeds to tape the proceedings over old footage of Rob&#x92;s ex-girlfriend, Beth (Odette Yustman)--images shot during happy times in that now-defunct relationship. Naturally, Beth shows up at the party with a new beau, bumming Rob out completely. Just before one's eyes glaze over from all this heartbreaking stuff (captured by Hud, who's something of a doofus, in laughably shaky camerawork), the unexpected happens: New York is suddenly under attack from a Godzilla-like monster stomping through midtown and destroying everything and everybody in sight. Rob and company hit the streets, but rather than run with other evacuees, they head toward the center of the storm so that Rob can rescue an injured Beth. There are casualties along the way, but the journey into fear is fascinating and immediate if emotionally remote--a consequence of seeing these proceedings through the singular, subjective perspective of a camcorder and of a story that intentionally leaves major questions unanswered: Who or what is this monster? Where did it come from? The lack of a backstory, and spare views of the marauding creature, are clever ways by producer J.J. Abrams and director Matt Reeves to keep an audience focused exclusively on what&#x92;s on the screen.  But it also makesCloverfieldcuriously uninvolving. Ultimately,Cloverfield, with its spectacular effects brilliantly woven into a home-video look, is a celebration of infinite possibilities in this age of accessible, digital media.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B004EPYZQ2", "B00IO9D3ZI", "B00EMMDMKM", "B002SJIO5E", "B0044ZOI32", "B001AR0D4A", "B004BZ5AMS", "B001MVYUQQ", "B003BJO8KU", "B0018AG6X6", "B005LAIGPU", "B00IO8VMB6", "B000PKG8SS", "B003Y5H5GU", "B00BPA2PGG", "B0017U7PT6", "B001YV502C", "B0013FBS20", "B008JFUR10", "B001KZVQJI", "B001CW7ZW6", "B0035WTJFW", "B000Y7U98W", "B003ABZGRI", "B000VDDWEC", "B000VDDWEM", "B002JT69IM", "B00164EAC8", "B002ZG981E", "B00AEFXORM", "B001DZOC3W", "B008SAPC20", "B003Y5H59M", "B00HERVMTK", "B00AVSFIV2", "B0032KNA4I", "B000L212HW", "B001FB55I0", "B0018O4YSQ", "B002ZG997M", "B002ZG9788", "B008G33O0G", "B000VDDWE2", "B00K2CHVSK", "B001GCUO5W", "B005J4TLQG", "B000PC6A3E", "B0027VT9ES", "B001F7MSG6", "B0051T46XM", "B00111YM60", "B001GZ6QEC", "B002HR1W1K", "B004SIPA4G", "B001OQCVII", "B001JNNDBA", "B001GKJ2FC", "B000WQWPKA", "B000OT6V00", "B0021L8UXK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004EPYZQ2", "B00IO8VMB6", "B004LWZW4W", "B005LAIHY0"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPXY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Wm5GO98oL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cloverfield [Theatrical Release]"}
{"description": "The 14-minute featurette \"Behind the Book: The Themes ofBridge to Terabithia\" discusses such topics as friendship and family as presented in both the book and the movie through interviews with the young lead actors, the book's author, Katherine Paterson, and several librarians and school teachers. Paterson and her son, producer-screenwriter David Paterson, also recall how an actual incident in David's life inspired the book. A six-minute visual-effects featurette looks at the film's creatures from sketch to computer design to screen, including how the features of the school kids helped shape the creatures. Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb, \"chaperoned\" by producer Lauren Levine, recount their experiences on one commentary track, while the second, by director Gabor Csupo, writer Jeff Stockwell, and producer Hal Lieberman, is drier but informative. Topics covered include praise for young Bailee Madison, how Zooey Deschanel wouldn't have been considered a predator back in the '70s, and the somewhat-controversial marketing campaign that focused heavily on the film's fantasy elements. Also included is Robb's music video for \"Keep Your Eyes Wide Open.\"--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB8KQ", "B00009XUM5", "B0009NZ2KG", "0060734019", "B00005JLOT", "B001NPD9JA", "B001APZMJS", "B0016Q2D5M", "B00AEFYIQ8", "B000E8M0VA", "B000Q66FB6", "B00005JPH2", "B000DBHX4M", "B0012IWO0I", "B0000VCZKW", "B00139W3NE", "B007R6DJP8", "B00005JG6M", "B000E6ES9E", "0064401847", "B003TNS3HC", "B001LPWGBO", "1557344019", "B00HR34TBE", "B004M1A21K", "B00005JMCW", "B007IU8YY4", "B00437IEI6", "B000GB5MH4", "B00ECW9U6M", "B00979KQFO", "B00BIYQPJC", "B000AM4P9A", "B0002S64VO", "B000J10FLY", "B00128VA76", "B000T9D6FS", "B003NHRIVQ", "1557344086", "B002GIBVV6", "B0050VDN76", "B000QUU7KW", "6305865612", "B000031EGV", "B0087F7VSY", "B000FFJYB6", "B000065V42", "B0009I7NGM", "B00AEBBA2M", "B002NZK5SW", "B000P0J09W", "B00AEFY8FO", "B0000633U5", "B0021L8URG", "B000AP04GK", "B000ION23A", "B002935GMS", "B004AKCME8", "B000G1R394", "1557344159", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00005TPMM", "0440414806", "B004SIP75S", "B0009JE57G", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B004NTDF5Q", "B003RHZ6IE", "B00005JNY3", "B0000YTP02", "B00005JMFH", "B003L4Y5BW", "B004A8ZX3C", "B001GC9VK6", "B00005RRG7", "B004SIPA9Q", "B000056T4I", "B001GCUO7A", "6305428042", "B008JFUS5A", "0312369816", "B001DDBD5E", "B000F2BNW2", "B000BJ7BCK", "B0001A79EO", "B001OQCV1K", "B005F96UJ6", "B0006J28MI", "0385736061", "B004QL7K16", "B0000AM6IY", "B0000AC8LI", "B0001I562I", "B003ZHR6TS", "B000NA28I4", "B00005JPO4"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBB8KQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBB8KQ", "B000E8M0VA", "0060734019", "B00005JPH2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 83708}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JPL5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VaImU5H0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bridge to Terabithia (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "For anyone who thought the Oscar-winning documentaryMarch of the Penguinswas the most marvelous cinematic moment for these nomads of the south, you haven't seen nothing yet.Happy Feetis an animated wonder about a penguin named Mumble who can't sing, but can dance up a storm. George Miller, the driving force behind theBabe(andMad Max) movies, takes another creative step in family entertainment with this big, beautiful, music-fueled film that will have kids and their parents dancing in the streets. From his first moment alive, Mumble (voiced Elijah Woods) feels the beat and can't stop dancing. Unfortunately, emperor penguins are all about finding their own heart song, and the dancing youngster--as cute as he is--is a misfit. Luckily, he bumps into little blue penguins and a Spanish-infused group (led by Robin Williams) and begins a series of adventures. Miller has an exceptional variety of entertainment: Busby Berkley musical numbers, amusement-park thrills, exciting chase sequences (seals and orca lovers might like think otherwise), and even an environmental message that doesn't weigh you down. Best of all, you don't know where the movie is going in the last act, a rare occurrence these days in family entertainment.

For American horror buffs, this collection is something of a holy grail: the complete rarely seen 1980 anthology series produced by England's famed Hammer Studios, the masters of their gothic domain. Hammer aficionados will want to start with \"The Silent Scream,\" which stars studio icon Peter Cushing in a terrifying story of captivity and comeuppance.  Veteran character actor Denholm Elliott stars as an unhappily married real estate agent in the grips of a recurring nightmare in \"Rude Awakening.\" As for rising stars, that's Pierce Brosnan in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo as Last Victim in \"Carpathian Eagle,\" a story about a homicidal author who beds her victims. MoreNight GallerythanTwilight Zone, this series recalls Hammer's gory--I mean, glory--days as the premier producer of elegantly disreputable horror films that were a cross between Masterpiece Theatre and Herschell Gordon Lewis.

{"description": "Recasting history as a particularly lavish soap opera,Victoria and  Albertsets the story of the relationship between the queen and her consort against a background of family strife and political wrangling. Sticklers for accuracy might be disappointed, but the strong cast and lavish production values make for an entertaining film.Victoria is barely 18 when her uncle King William IV dies. She is introduced by the family adviser to a young German prince called Albert, and in spite of their initial indifference to one another and a great deal of political opposition, they fall in love. Marriage brings its own problems, however, and as Victoria, grows from an inexperienced young woman into a shrewd and powerful monarch  Albert struggles to find a role for himself in both the family and the nation.The relationship between Victoria and Albert was a remarkable one and this film, while occasionally erring on the side of sentiment, brings that relationship to life. The young leads are charming, but it is the supporting cast of British acting stalwarts--including Nigel Hawthorne, David Suchet, and Diana Rigg--who makeVictoria and Alberttruly worth watching.--Simon Leake", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302676185", "6303921248"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 470170}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 5.98, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005O7N7", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518D8VPDY2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Victoria &amp; Albert [VHS]"}

A quick trip back to London clarifies Poirot's memory of a similar crime that captured headlines in Britain ten years earlier. A beautiful young chanteuse - and prime suspect - captivates Hastings.

{"description": "Few things are more sure-fire creepy than huge abandoned buildings, andSession 9has one of the eeriest buildings you've ever seen. A  hazardous-materials-cleanup company has been hired to eliminate asbestos  tiles and other toxic material from a gigantic mental hospital that had  been shut down in the 1980s. But as one member of the team starts to nose  into old files in the office, he uncovers a series of tape recordings of  psychiatric sessions--nine of them--related to a notorious sexual abuse  case. Soon, toxic materials and dark spirits start to merge. LikeThe  Blair Witch Project(and most horror movies, really),Session 9is longer on atmosphere and dream logic than story--but the atmosphere is  effectively unsettling. A strong cast (including Peter Mullan, David  Caruso, and Brendan Sexton III) do an effective job of slowly cracking  under stress and evil influences.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0028DRGDQ", "0783116926", "B00125WATQ", "B002OVO18A", "B0015ET3YO", "B001KKU9CI", "B006QWC2ZC", "B008WAM2E2", "B00344EAM8", "B000274TLW", "B001MEJY8W", "B005B0QYMM", "B0052DP1RC", "B003Q6D246", "B004YCKJ9C", "B00LBFFR2Y", "B0083H6B0U", "B004W48KHK", "B0081HLME2", "B000GSYRY6", "B004SUDQDG", "B00C7T0EPS", "B00ATP23TW", "B00AN10NU8", "B007XF0W3K", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00LFN00GU", "B006Z7Z3S6", "B00IXD2MWK", "B00ARWX9NG", "B003Y5H5G0", "B0015ET3YY", "B000X1RYEQ", "B002EOVXBK", "B00DBPBOZG", "B00005NFZC", "B005SQRYB4", "B002LMSWN2", "B000RW5BZ0", "B0004Z31OS", "B00F3OLVHY", "B0009X75EC", "B00BSU0FQA", "B0019X3YX2", "B00G5GNYY2", "6305238065", "B000IMUYJM", "B0014VPFVS", "B006YTGLEU", "B0007WQHI0", "B003TRMLQM", "B002AS45VK", "B00ELQHX5O", "B005LAIGOQ", "B004LWZW24", "B00023P4UQ", "B009XTF8KQ", "B001D5C1OO", "B00FYV7WCY", "B000PMLJMQ", "B000BTJDGC", "B00EZ50SGW", "B000067J0M", "078062856X", "B00006FDBW", "B005DCJ2RW", "B000MV8ABS", "B0002C4JJ4", "B008G33PIM", "B00J5LXT6M", "B002JT69IW", "B00020HAX8", "B000WC38EQ", "B000EOTVU2", "B0007Y08QA", "B004FUPK6U", "B000GCFO0I", "B000GI3RHY", "B00009PY32", "B00HHYF56Q", "B005BYBZM2", "B004SEUJL4", "B0000CC885", "B00GS08UDU", "B001D2WU9I", "B007726J4U", "B00J5G1MU2", "B00HEM9PY4", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B00AZTUUQK", "B00009MEC4", "B006U49SC6", "B0006SGYL0", "B00009WVSQ", "B00GC2KIGG", "073873750X", "B00INC7FR8", "B00AJLHUA8", "B002FICQFM", "B00A2H9L2E"], "bought_together": ["0783116926"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002OVO18A", "B000274TLW", "B0028DRGDQ", "B000AXWHSA"]}, "price": 9.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 67210}, "asin": "B00005UQ9F", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41799DP5ZZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Session 9"}

{"description": "Rupert Everett narrates this sensitive documentary about the Nazi persecution of homosexuals during World War II. \"Paragraph 175\" refers to the old German penal code concerning homosexuality, which was used to justify the prosecution of gay men during the war (the code ignored lesbians, still considered viable baby-making vessels). As mere rumor became enough to justify imprisonment, over 100,000 were arrested and between 10,000 and 15,000 were sent to concentration camps. InParagraph 175, Klaus M&uuml;ller, a historian from the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, sets out to interview the fewer than 10 who are known to remain alive. The film covers the astonishingly quick rise of Hitler (one interviewee points out how ridiculous a figure he seemed at first) and the shock that more liberal Germans felt as it became clear that he was a force to be reckoned with. Some of the film's most touching moments come when the participants reminisce about their first loves and the \"homosexual Eden\" that was Berlin in the 1930s. This is a beautifully well made documentary that poignantly captures a piece of nearly forgotten history.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00HHYF5EI", "B00EU8RB14", "B00HUQCA28", "B0001Y4LDM", "B00996RSYM", "B00008R9KB", "B00EJUXNOM", "B00E849QSG", "B00GHP8SH4", "1555830064", "B00005YUO1", "B00FGG60XY", "B00F98FOPE", "B000067D0Y", "B004EI2NWM", "B000YHQNCI", "B001BMN35K", "B00005JO5L", "0299165043", "0156005816", "B00DYA7Y8Y", "B00005JMLR", "B000ADWCV2", "B000092T3P", "B007HC8DX0", "B002Y3GZD2", "B00FL2EWYM", "B000F6II1M", "B00B2DGYQS", "B003IG06PM", "B003BR8ME0", "B0096UG7XY", "B0007TKOS2", "B00A92MGLA", "B000MGUZFW", "6305847045", "B00B02QUOC", "B004GFGUDQ", "B00005AWR9", "B009SFR2QI", "B005FQN524", "B00AWQEK26", "0062196243", "0304329568", "0306807564", "B0016MXK9O", "B00668IE9O", "B000CNEZ1A", "B0089N7STG", "B0002TT08W", "B003BV8I86", "B000IJ7A6A", "B005AY110O", "1932134670", "B000GBEWI4"], "bought_together": ["B00008R9KB"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0299165043", "0465018483", "0805006001", "1555830064"]}, "price": 29.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 46812}, "asin": "B00005YUP1", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z0M4V12NL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Paragraph 175"}

{"description": "Denison Clift was a story writer, novelist and playwright before he entered the film industry in 1918. After writing the screenplay for William S. Hart&#x92;s Wolves of the Rail, he spent a period of time as a contract writer for Fox Studios and then got into direction himself. He made a mark with feature films like Demos (1921) and The Love of Mary, Queen of Scots (1923). PHANTOM SHIP/The Mystery of the Mary Celeste (1935) was a daunting and hugely successful undertaking starring the famous Bela Lugosi, and earned him widespread recognition. He continued to work as a freelance screenwriter, this always having been his primary passion and forte.THE PLOT: The American ship Mary Celeste&#x92; was found drifting in the middle of the Atlantic on December 5, 1872, abandoned and derelict.  In this reconstruction from the records of the Attorney General at Gibraltar, the story starts at New York Harbor in 1872, where Captain Benjamin Briggs (Arthur Margetson) is hard pressed to find a crew for the &#x91;Mary Celeste&#x92;. The ship has a reputation for being jinxed. However, he intends to sail at all costs, for he intends to marry the exquisite Sarah Briggs (Shirley Grey) on high seas. Captain Morehead (Clifford McLaglen) has already asked for her hand, and is willing to make a considerable sacrifice for her, but he loses out to the headstrong Briggs.  On the dock, the drunken, one-armed sailor Anton Lorenzen (Bela Lugosi) arrives at Simpson&#x92;s Bar, aged years beyond his time after a mishap at sea. When Capt. Briggs talks the local loan shark into shanghaiing a crew for him, he manages to lure Lorenzen into signing up with the promise of unlimited booze. But Capt. Briggs is still one man short, and approaches Morehead. Bent on revenge for being cheated out of his love, Morehead plants a saboteur on board. With an unwilling crew on board, the deck is set for disaster.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000G6L7X2", "B00DE1LD6W", "B004RPQSNM", "B000Y2Q9J0", "B000C20VNM", "B00D9EJFZA", "B00000ILEU", "B00B94VJYW", "0783233582", "B0000694WH", "B00AJXO4FA", "B00003XAMS", "B000TGJ89E", "B000087F1W", "B00004WL4P", "6305944024", "6305636419", "B00004WG6Y", "B000067IW1", "B00004W5UT", "B00006G8HR", "B000R57W9A", "B0026RB2J8", "B00004W5UV", "B001BSBBMQ", "B004TH78EG", "B008XB2U9W", "B004SEUJ5U", "B00092ZKYK", "B00003XAMP", "B001B187G6", "B00004WMKU", "B00002E20D"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00076S3YM"]}, "price": 13.49, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 316960}, "asin": "B0000648Y8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513KHF10Y9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Phantom Ship"}

Fox, in one of his first leading roles (it  was shot beforeBack to the Futurebut released in that blockbuster's  wake, and cashed in nicely). Although his werewolf makeup makes him look more  like Bigfoot than Lon Chaney, Jr., Fox manages to convey his peppy personality  even under all that hair.Teen Wolf Too, however, is not even bearable.  Here Fox is replaced by Jason Bateman, who finds that his wolfish inclination  helps him become the big dog on the college boxing team.

{"description": "Based on the book by Bill Carter and Marc Gunther, this immensely entertaining made-for-cable film tells it like it was in chronicling the golden age ofMonday Night Football, a bold experiment in prime-time programming that transformed the pop-culture landscape. Carrying the ball for the lesser-known ensemble is John Turturro's Emmy-worthy performance as Howard Cosell, who played the role of \"provocateur\" in the then-revolutionary three-man booth that included in its heyday \"Dandy\" Don Meredith (Brad Beyer) and Frank Gifford (Kevin Anderson). John Heard gives a career-best performance as ABC producer Roone Arledge, who nurtured his brainchild and brilliantly massaged the egos of his stars. His prickly, more complex relationship with Cosell is the heart of this film. Rich with incident,Monday Night Mayhemspans from Muhammad Ali's controversial anti-Vietnam War stance and the blood-soaked 1972 Munich Olympics to John Lennon's death, which Cosell announced to a shocked nation. Also comic and compelling is the behind-the-scenes in-fighting and the colorful backstage characters.

{"description": "On March 12, 2002,The Shieldburst onto the FX network like an incendiary grenade, and basic cable TV would never be the same. Creator Shawn Ryan's uncompromising police drama pushed the limits of basic-cable permissiveness, bridging the relative discretion ofNYPD Blueand the HBO liberties ofThe Wire. Without exception, these 13 episodes justify their hype, focusing on pugnacious detective Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis), whose amoral Strike Team employs dubious tactics in the crime-ridden (and fictional) Farmington district of Los Angeles. Mackey and his maverick partners are at odds with seasoned detectives and beat cops, escalating tensions with precinct Capt. Aceveda (Benito Martinez), a Latino with flexible scruples and a political agenda.The series invites viewers to form their own judgments regarding Mackey's volatile behavior, which includes killing an undercover cop in the electrifying pilot episode. While each episode stands alone as groundbreaking drama, the arc of the series incorporates Aceveda's campaign to end Mackey's career; the self-loathing of a homosexual rookie (Michael Jace) whose partner (Catherine Dent) is Mackey's occasional mistress; a straight-laced detective (Jay Karnes) yearning for respect; Mackey's compassionate attempt to rehabilitate a crack whore (Jamie Brown, giving the season's finest guest performance); the autism of Mackey's young son and the recklessness of his closest partner (Walton Goggins); and the vigilant stoicism of Det. Wyms (CCH Pounder), who's as sensibly upright as Mackey is corrupted.Teeming with gang-bangers, perverts, rapists, and killers,The Shieldis unabashedly adult; even liberal viewers may flinch at plots involving child pornography and serial murder. Chiklis deservedly won an Emmy for maintaining the series' delicate morality; Mackey's a hero squirming in his own ethical quicksand. This daring edginess makesThe Shieldunique, and generous DVD supplements explore Ryan's creative impulse. Two featurettes offer behind-the-scenes overviews, while the all-episode commentaries allow extensive insight from every member of the series' principal cast and crew. Audition tapes prove that the cast was primed for ensemble excellence, and deleted scenes further demonstrate the series' challenging ambiguity.The Shieldis excellent TV for those who can grasp its complexities; all others beware.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0012CJQYG", "B0012CJQYQ", "B0012CJQZ0", "B0012CJQZA", "B0015TX2LO", "B0020TS5EM", "B0002ERXC2", "B00DJYJRHG", "B00188XHF8", "B0038M2APA", "B00123BY6S", "B000YW8RPE", "B0025KVKDE", "B0006IUD9Y", "B000QXDJLI", "B00B5J6A7W", "B00188XHFI", "B00005Y6YJ", "B0008JIJ1A", "B000FTCLSU", "B004HW7JNS", "B007A2Z3Y4", "B000GH3CWK", "B001NXDIMK", "B009VXVMAO", "B000ENUYGI", "B000FKO3GW", "B003XMKUEI", "B001DJLCRC", "B0060MYKYY", "B000NDEXK2", "B00EEDNR9A", "B002N5N5QQ", "B0024FAR5M", "B00008YGRU", "B00008PHCZ", "B00003CXOP", "B0000Y40PW", "B00AB65RUG", "B002ZCY80O", "B0058YPG1G", "B000BZISRG", "B0032UYFA6", "B001RTSPVY", "B003L77GK6", "B0002XVQSU", "B00CT48W14", "B000EXDS0C", "B0006FO5LO", "B0001O3YLM", "B00HUCF420", "B001934SNM", "B005SEDI5M", "B000Q6GUW0", "B000GB75CO", "B0058YPGSY", "B0058YPPN0", "B00BFAIH68", "B000OIOOVE", "B000V86OKG", "B00BUEUH6C", "B00ITAQ2T6", "B0001I55ZQ", "B001QE99AQ", "B000FIMG68", "B0024F08RO", "B00000FBH2", "B000P6YNSE", "B005LAJ16I", "B0015ABRE2", "B00J5LXT44", "B003CPPY5G", "B00HT850YW", "B005LAJ1H2", "B000FFJYE8", "B00005NOHO", "B000RO6JY0", "B000BOH8YG", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B009LDCZ7I", "B000CR7RCK", "B002DQSKME", "B000FUTVLO", "B0015RRNMA", "B002N5N5M0", "B009LDD54K", "B000GTLQVW", "B00915G6WQ", "B0007YMVWO", "B001MVWRNE", "B0036TGTF2", "B00BWDFP5E", "B002WQ799U", "B000BOH986", "B000RF1QE2", "B002WQ79A4", "B00031TYBC", "B000YABIQ6", "B00CD45JBG", "B0013ZGN9I"], "bought_together": ["B0012CJQYG", "B0012CJQYQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DJYJRHG", "B0012CJQYG", "B0038M2APA", "B0012CJQYQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 125999}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 24.99, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B00006RCNW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G3B35AR4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Shield - The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "The mysteriousTime Outis a riveting film, despite (because of?) the fact that hardly anything happening in it corresponds to our notion of movie \"action.\" Vincent (Aur&#xE9;lien Recoing, a top French theater actor but cinematic newcomer) is an out-of-work family man living along the Swiss border. He's never told anyone he's lost his job with a U.N. bureau. He leaves home in the morning--when not working out of his (nonexistent) Geneva apartment--and does things like go to an all-glass office tower and hover as if he belonged. Vincent's excellent at seeming to belong; Recoing's performance is an uncanny symphony of collegial tics, benign watchfulness, and shy, tolerant shrugs. Eventually we gather that Vincent is running a swindle, the ease of which seems to quietly horrify him. However, the most unsettling thing about his fictional work posture is that we come to realize it's scarcely less genuine than, or different from, the shell game that is the real thing.--Richard T.

Perfect, that is, until they pick on the wrong wholesome but incredibly feisty young family. There's the plot, and boom--you're off.

There are a few genuinely surprising plot twists, and while many movies dull their villains' edges by cartoonishly over- or underplaying their evil,Trappedis refreshingly unafraid to make Joe realistically, skin-crawlingly vile. Even our heroes turn out to have surprising sadistic streaks.

{"description": "Notoriously, and entirely appropriately, the original outline for Doug Naylor and Rob Grant's comedy sci-fi seriesRed Dwarfwas sketched on the back of a beer mat. When it finally appeared on British television in 1988, the show had clearly stayed true to its roots, mixing jokes about excessive curry consumption with affectionate parodies of classic sci-fi. Indeed, one of the show's most endearing and enduring features is its obvious respect for genre conventions, even as it gleefully subverts them. The scenario owes something to Douglas Adams's satiricalHitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, something toThe Odd Couple, and a lot more to the slacker sci-fi of John Carpenter'sDark Star. Behind the crew's constant bickering there lurks an impending sense that life, the universe, and everything are all someone's idea of a terrible joke.Later seasons broadened the show's horizons until at last its premise was so diluted as to be unrecognizable, but in the six episodes of the first season, the comedy is witty and intimate, focusing on characters and not special effects.

{"description": "The Killers(1946)This 1946 adaptation of Ernest Hemingway's short story adds well over an hour of new material to the original tale. The reason is, while director Robert Siodmak, star Burt Lancaster, and an outstanding supporting cast are faithful to Hemingway's work, his story only takes up about 15 minutes of screen time. Burt Lancaster plays the doomed man sought by hired guns in a small town. Hemingway's bruisingly concise dialogue makes an early sequence set in a diner quite unnerving, but after the killers dispense with their prey, Siodmak turns to an insurance investigator (Edmond O'Brien) who looks into the reasons behind the murder. An exemplary film noir (complete with a fickle femme fatale played by Ava Gardner),The Killersis all mood and fatalism.The Killers(1964)The 1964 remake (of sorts) by Don Siegel builds another whole world around Hemingway's narrow, if intense, premise. The two assassins of Siegel's film (Clu Gulager, Lee Marvin) go in search of their intended victim--a teacher (John Cassavetes) at a school for the blind--and find that he not only recognizes his fate when they show up, but seems entirely resigned to it. Curiosity leads the killers to seek out the party who hired them and discover why Cassavetes's character didn't run or fight. Soon the facts tumble into place--the dead man had once been a top-drawer racer who fell for a glamorous woman (Angie Dickinson), the latter gradually pulling him into the orbit of a criminal villain (a convincingly evil Ronald Reagan)--and the film becomes increasingly dark and dangerous. Originally shot for television but rejected for its violence, Siegel's film is a blistering experience of swimming against the currents of fate for one's survival--and losing.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00023P4GA", "B0006Z2NE0", "B000MTEFOQ", "B00012L786", "B00097DY2A", "B00005AUK9", "B004C2523M", "B000M2E3GI", "B000244F2S", "B000B8384Q", "B00005RDRL", "B000087F79", "B005152C9G", "B00023P4II", "B000EXDSBQ", "B009X919UE", "B000CNE088", "B001CC7PM6", "B00004W229", "B0006Z2NDQ", "B0007ZEO8C", "B00004W19C", "B00005AUK7", "B000244EWO", "B0024FAG8A", "B0007ZEO7S", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B0087ZG7OI", "B000244EX8", "B000LN6UHI", "B0024FAG80", "B000244EYW", "B00023P4G0", "B000B83846", "B0009X7682", "B000PKG7DE", "B000AQKUG8", "B00004XPPK", "B00005AUKD", "B00008LDNZ", "B00005A8TX", "6305770328", "B000B8380A", "B00ICWO1LC", "6305999872", "B0080JG2GE", "B00347AILW", "B00CVB6XF2", "B00J2PQYY0", "B00023P4FQ", "B00005Y70U", "B000FI9OCW", "B003ZYU3U0", "B001TIQT6G", "B000244EWY", "B000H0JD88", "B0010KHOSU", "B000PKG6OE", "B000PMFRW4", "B00097DY0M", "B000BGH2NG", "B0010KHOSA", "B00007ELD1", "B00FPUN21O", "B00006II5J", "B001SMC9L2", "B00GBT62PQ", "B001CW7ZSU", "B0006UEVVS", "B001CC7PLW", "B00097DY1G", "B00097DY20", "B0006HC0I2", "B00BGARG3C", "B00IGK6T9W", "B003D3Y65G", "B000AM6OOE", "B00AEBBA7W", "B000KJTGFG", "B000PMFRVU", "B00074DY0M", "B00DBE97S8", "B0000BUZKP", "B004UOHNAC", "B00IGK6TGU", "B00E18QK9W", "B00GBT629C", "B00E18QKJ2", "B00GPPXNEE", "B003G9IT3C", "B00KIZYDCI", "B00AEFXRWO", "B0009X7678", "B00EL6A9CI", "B00I9BU3M2", "B0089LT7ZG", "B004VL1ERW", "B000EBD9TE", "B002945DUM", "B000RXVND8"], "bought_together": ["B00023P4GA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0046WM7YU", "B00023P4GA", "B00023P4II", "B005152C9G"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22937}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 35.11, "brand": "", "asin": "B00007ELDG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5186E1WJSDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Killers (The Criterion Collection)"}

{"description": "Director Luigi Cozzi's science fiction thriller, which borrows wholesale fromAlienfor its loopy plot, is a gleefully cheesy gorefest that should please horror fans with a fondness for the lowbrow. Long-suffering Eurocult Ian McCulloch (Zombie) stars as an astronaut who joins an investigation into the appearance of extraterrestrial eggs on a ghost ship in New York's harbor. Their search uncovers an Earth-based conspiracy to cultivate the eggs for world domination. Despite the abundant gore and lunk-headed script,Contaminationhas an endearingly naive tone that suggests '50s-era B science fiction (of which Cozzi is a fan); as such, one can't be too harsh on a film that displays its affections so openly. Amazingly,Contaminationhas been banned in England since being named in the \"video nasty\" debacle of the early '80s. Blue Underground's widescreen DVD is uncut (with 5.1 Dolby and DTS sound!), and should be a welcome addition to any cult collector's cache.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00LMBUR6S", "B00LBFFR2Y", "B00LT1JHLW", "B00LMBURDG", "B00LFN00GU", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B000TZJCNW", "B00KL3TT8A", "B00KTFJ50M", "B00A429Y56", "B00KNSJVEA", "B000AC7P5Q", "B00DOZNGTK", "B00BCMSY80", "B00K1L4NBU", "B000S0GYRK", "B0036R92UI", "B000HXDWNM", "B000063K1F", "B000TZJCOG", "B00L22H2IS", "B00HRUQB8Q", "B000TZJCMS", "B00CPTUNUG", "B0057O6IMS", "B000TZJCNM", "B000MV8ZCW", "B00C1PKRJ6", "B00009WNXA", "B0057O6IDW", "B008DRKJ76", "B000RPCJA2", "0783228457", "B000096I9V", "B0002C9DK4", "B001B187L6", "B003QLECZY", "B00HRUQ7WG", "B00I31COHA", "B00AJXO4FA", "B000V6LT6C", "B000TZJCNC", "B000S0GYRU", "B0012IV3SC", "B004KDYR20", "B002GPVDMG", "B0012IV3S2", "B00GHH9IIA", "B00GBJWY76", "B001D5C1R6", "B004SL04WQ", "B001HZ4KD0", "B0072GPQ8G", "B00005U12U", "B00GOT1DIE", "B0036R92US", "B008I34YOE", "B00AWWX6XY", "B004GF3IJU", "B00IA1VKVY", "B00GHH9GSC", "B00006FMC2", "B00005RDAI", "B00IQHPS6A", "B000B64TZA", "B00JHH1VSW", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B002E01MI8", "B00FUABK36", "B00B49GSQQ", "B00IPAORFG", "B00FUABJJQ", "B00018YCTQ", "B00E5S2HGS", "B00CU00JTU", "B000KN9F6W", "B00K8EVSVI", "B002E01MHY", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B0018BA72G", "B001D5C1OO", "B00CPTUNWO", "B004GYKNHQ", "B000AM6MVO", "B009IV2Z3M", "B00DPUB57Y", "B00GSTHD1G", "B0053TWW9K", "B00JJOY45U", "B00BCMT2BI", "B00JV054A6", "B007ZFSBWW", "B0000C8AUD", "B00C7A8WZQ", "B00023P4SS", "B0000694YT", "B00C7E3EDW", "B00I462XNO", "B004FUPK6U", "B002TLRGAU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00862WFK2", "B0036R92US", "B003NHMYHO", "B00005U12U"]}, "price": 12.58, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 498007}, "asin": "B00007L4MC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N4VSVKMVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Contamination"}

{"description": "A grainy, enigmatic videotape has the power to kill people seven days after they watch it. This brilliant premise fueled the 2002 Hollywood hitThe Ring, but before that it conquered Japan inRingu, Hideo Nakata's quietly unsettling study in terror. Fans of the U.S. version will find a less elaborate storyline and more primal fear in the original; the basic plot, however, still has a worried reporter (Nanako Matsushima) tracking down the meaning of the video--and, having watched it herself, she has only a week to work. The film's calm, economical style actually adds to the creeping sense of dread throughout, and the hair-curling set-pieces stand out in contrast. Like an old photograph of something evil,Ringuhas the strange-but-familiar power to unnerve. Guaranteed, its effect will linger for at least seven days.

{"description": "It's easy to identify the biggest attraction ofKilling Me Softly: two fetching actors (Heather Graham, Joseph Fiennes) and lots of nudity--especially in theunrated version. It's harder to choose the bigger liability: the dialogue howlers (as Fiennes binds Graham in ropes, she says, \"Sometimes I feel like I don't know you\") or the incredibly obvious solution to the big mystery. The story is an unofficial update of Hitchcock'sSuspicion: a new wife wonders whether her unbelievably charismatic husband might be a murderer. The Chinese filmmaker Chen Kaige (Farewell My Concubine) turns out to be exactly the wrong director for this overheated slice ofl'amour fouin London, but with the hopeless pairing of Graham and Fiennes as the passionate lovers, he didn't have much of a chance.

{"description": "TheIdentityDVD features are not quite as enticing as they sound.  Of chief interest is the extended branched version of the film (available in widescreen only), but there's only one added scene (an interesting but not critical minute-long sequence that would have been the first conference-room scene), and the differences in the alternate ending are so subtle that you'll miss them if you literally blink a few times.  There's no question it could affect audience perception, but unlike most alternate endings, it doesn't affect the actual outcome.  (Seespoilerfor more information.)  The four deleted scenes (which don't include either of the above-mentioned additions) aren't that exciting, and the optional director commentary notes that these deletions generally served to cut moments of character and comic relief in favor of moving the story along, which is one reason the film runs a brisk 90 minutes. James Mangold's director commentary on the feature is good, though, as he discusses such matters as the logistics of the perpetual downpour and a crucial bit of dialogue removed from the film's climax.  Considering that downpour and the contrasting darks and lights of the film, picture quality is good, and the thunder claps sound great in 5.1 sound so there are no complaints about the DVD's presentation of the film itself.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000TJ6PBK", "B00006AUJR", "B0009YA3OA", "B000DZ7YN8", "B00005JNY3", "B00AADAK5W", "1558908382", "B00008K77D", "B0002DB54A", "B000RGN2JI", "B00AEBB8NI", "B000P0I4O4", "B00003CXZ4", "B004ZNFTDQ", "B0015XHQVC", "B00026ZD04", "B00014NEZI", "B003LR5BD0", "B00092ZLSK", "B004SIP92O", "B00000JGHL", "B003VA3JUO", "B00BNH9NCU", "B00DZP1C2W", "B00I45844W", "B004YCKKFK", "B00011CZRE", "B0002234LS", "B001HVZOB6", "B005S9EJ8W", "B000A2UBN4", "B00HOGBXS6", "B000OYC7BW", "B0004Z31OS", "B00AEBB89W", "B00AEFXW8I", "B00009OWJY", "B002NZK5RI", "B00AEFXEGS", "B00007AJF8", "B003ASLJQ8", "B000R4SMCW", "B000069HZP", "B00003CXGA", "B00005V9HH", "B0001FR3IQ", "B00005JPT0", "B000SK5Z20", "B00008YJDK", "B0013D8LBS", "6305238065", "B0021L8UFI", "B004P7CN7W", "078322799X", "B001OQCV2E", "B0002WT4OE", "B00B6OEB18", "B00003CXKM", "B004SIP9RO", "B000RZIGUE", "B004B3PBFQ", "B004LWZW24", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00096S49Y", "B000LC55F2", "0783240295", "B00009L1TA", "B0034G4P30", "B002O3Z4WK", "B00005JLO8", "B001ILFUBE", "B00005JKIS", "B004SIP9MY", "6305718954", "B000ALM40I", "B0001Z52RU", "B0010X73ZG", "B000A5045Q", "B00005JMWP", "B00005JN2Z", "B000F5WR4W", "B0000648X0", "B0021L8UPS", "B00AEBBA2W", "6301971345", "B002UJIY7A", "B0006IIKQW", "B00B96TGQS", "B004BLJQOK", "B00AEFXKZ8", "6304806434", "B001NPD9LS", "B000U1ZV76", "B003L20IEW", "B00596WFE4", "B000GCFO0I", "B00005UQ9W", "B000053UIF", "B0000YTOL2"], "bought_together": ["B000TJ6PBK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000TJ6PBK", "B0012Q7M02", "B00006AUJR", "B00AEBBA2W"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30202}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.73, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00008EY9G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RKTbv5kkL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Identity"}

{"description": "Academy Award(R)-nominee Edward Norton (Best Actor, 1999, AMERICAN HISTORY X) heads an amazing all-star cast in the critically acclaimed Spike Lee (SUMMER OF SAM, DO THE RIGHT THING) film 25th HOUR. In 24 short hours Monty Brogan (Norton) goes to prison for seven long years.  Once a king of Manhattan, Monty is about to say good-bye to the life he knew -- a life that opened doors to New York's swankest clubs but also alienated him from the people closest to him.  In his last day on the outside, Monty tries to reconnect with his father (Brian Cox, THE BOURNE IDENTITY), and gets together with two old friends, Jacob (Philip Seymour Hoffman, ALMOST FAMOUS) and Slaughtery (Barry Pepper, THE GREEN MILE).  And then there's his girlfriend, Naturelle (Rosario Dawson, MEN IN BLACK 2), who might (or might not) have been the one who tipped off the cops. Monty's not sure of much these days, but with time running out, there are choices to be made as he struggles to redeem himself in the 25th hour.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001MZ5W3M", "B002LVVCJY", "B00008WI9N", "B0014GI6I2", "B00112S8RS", "B00005BCK9", "B0047T74CM", "B00AEBB8LA", "6305803765", "B002WNU0QW", "B00000IC7G", "B000E33VWW", "6305313687", "B0000BXMZ8", "B008220DGE", "B0013XZ2QK", "B001P3SA8K", "B004SIP71M", "B00320J6WS", "B0006GW2JU", "B00002RAO2", "B00AQBDU4Q", "B000GDH9NM", "B00AEFXE9U", "B00000G02H", "B00AEBB8SS", "B00AQTY3JO", "B00003CWTI", "B000PAAJZ6", "6305781095", "B000K7VHQ4", "B00562D3Y2", "B0001CNRRU", "0452282950", "B000NOIX48", "B00008YJDK", "B0060ZJ7DA", "630514415X", "B000GFLKF8", "B001MZ5W46", "B002QFYJF4", "B004SIP73U", "B001P3SA8A", "B0009W5IMO", "B001LLH8SO", "B00005JMW7", "B00005JLKN", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00AEFXE3Q", "B003BV8I3Q", "B00005JLRE", "B008NNY8SQ", "B001BP4K22", "B00390560M", "B0060ZJ7AI", "B0024EWP6W", "0783226845", "B00005V9HH", "B002LVVCK8", "B000J10F14", "0783230443", "B000R4SMCW", "B000YENUI6", "B00979KQ4U", "B00AEBBA4K", "B000KX0IOK", "B000HRMAPE", "B00320JAXS", "B0001907AI", "B001N44BVQ", "B00005A1TJ", "B000XJD34S", "B000ZS8GWQ", "B000286RP2", "B00003CXWV", "B000KX0IM2", "B0034G4OSG", "B00HOGBXS6", "B008220DIC", "B00006RCNV", "B003CJXIOG", "0767830555", "B000E40QC4", "B00006CXI1", "0786707720", "B000M341SC", "B0018BD9DA", "B004U7MR14", "B00H9KKKAY", "B00112S8S2", "B004SIP7VM", "B00AEFXEN6", "B00000F7E6", "B00005UQ9T", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEBBA5E", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00102F5WK", "B001O7JHSE"], "bought_together": ["B0014GI6I2", "B000E33VWW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["6305313687", "B000K7VHQ4", "B00AEBB8LA", "0452282950"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12242}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.5, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00008K7AO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G2DT6QWQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "25th Hour"}

{"description": "Conspiracies abound inChildren of Dune, Sci-Fi Channel's praiseworthy miniseries sequel toFrank Herbert's Dune, loyally adapted from the Herbert novelsDune MessiahandChildren of Duneby John Harrison, who passed directorial duties (due to a scheduling conflict) to Greg Yaitanes, a 31-year-old TV director andDuneneophyte tackling his biggest assignment to date. Uninitiated viewers face a disadvantage; it's best to readHerbert's booksand/or see the first miniseries before plunging into this remarkably coherent tangle of political intrigue, unfolding 12 years after the events ofDune.To his horror, Maud'Dib--Arrakis emperor Paul Atreides (Alec Newman, reprising hisDunerole)--has become the unintended figurehead of a violent dictatorship, and his enemies are multiplying. Vanishing into the desert, he waits as destiny shapes his twin heirs Leto II (James McAvoy) and Ghanima (Jessica Brooks), who must contend with their scheming aunt Alia (Daniela Amavia) while Princess Wensicia (Susan Sarandon), of the enemy House Corrino, plots her own attack on Maud'Dib's familial empire. Exiled Atreides matriarch Lady Jessica (Alice Krige, giving the film's finest performance) returns to Arrakis, where the enormous, desert-dwelling sandworms face an uncertain future. As always, the spice must flow, and the universe's most coveted commodity remains at the center of this richly detailed and physically impressive production. Special effects range from awesome (fly-over shots of the capital city, Arakeen) to awful (the saber-tooth tigers look likeJumanjirejects), andDunedevotees will endlessly debate the miniseries' strengths and weaknesses. Some may desire more action to punctuate the film's inherent verbosity, but consensus will surely conclude that this isDunedone right, with monumental effort and obvious devotion from everyone involved.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000639EV", "0783226063", "B00371QQ0M", "0441328008", "0441294677", "0441104029", "076535148X", "0441102670", "0765351498", "0765362619", "0425068137", "0441172695", "B00008NGHU", "B00K2CHWYI", "0553580302", "0765351501", "0765362627", "0553580337", "0441966918", "B00J5LXMTG", "B006JN87WK", "B00077BPA0", "0553580272", "1847374255", "076534078X", "B00EQ2KVQQ", "0765322749", "0441172717", "B00005JNV9", "0765340798", "B008R65XN8", "0765353709", "B00B04NIZO", "B0002Y4TWE", "B002ZG99EK", "B000056WR3", "B000ATQYXI", "B003XURDAY", "B000B8I9XQ", "B002KPINY8", "0765340771", "B000001ZD2", "B00HWWUQYY", "B00CBFB8OE", "B0039PGH9G", "B00D3DJIG8", "0765301571", "B0045HCJ9O", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B002436WFI", "B00K7IPGS6", "B004EXWGHY", "B008JFUNHI", "B000BCCAEQ", "B00005QAPI", "B0006IIPIK", "B0006FO9B0", "B0010X744G", "B000E5N6B6", "B000VSDNFA", "B00005JM39", "B008M4MB8K", "B000JLTRHW", "1574925628", "B00JBGWP3Y", "B00JLDTB2U", "B00363WGB4", "B00003CXCT", "B008R52LA2", "B002I9Z8GW", "B008JFUNJQ", "B0050MB5KM", "B0019BI1DM", "B006MFQ4OS", "B002WNU0QM", "B002QW7ALM", "B000OY9VFW", "B005LAIHXQ", "B00C8CQTJY", "B00GX7D5G0", "B00E8S2JZ4", "B00JQYUV9Q", "B0007P0Y7C", "B00366F2NU", "B0009JE6G6", "B0000VCZK2", "0783225903", "B000062XF2", "B00A04YHI2", "B00HERGM86", "B001TH16DI", "B00A2H9OZS", "B003BV8I7C", "B001KOFH2G", "B001CEE1YE", "B000WTZ6SK", "B000BW7QWW", "B00H83EV5W", "B004HZY8OS", "B0029778T8"], "bought_together": ["0783226063"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000639EV", "0783226063", "B00FP20ZCG", "0441172717"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 19117}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 89.99, "brand": "IVE", "asin": "B00008RUYH", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DQ3EJGD5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Frank Herbert's Children of Dune: Sci-Fi TV Miniseries (Two-Disc DVD Set)"}

{"description": "Jack Bauer is having another one of his \"very bad days\" in the second season of the groundbreaking real-time thriller24. Once again the hours are ticking by with more guaranteed cliffhangers than a convention of mountain climbers. Holed up in a Los Angeles condo and estranged from his daughter, Jack is no longer on the government payroll; unfortunately for him, this small fact doesn't seem to matter to President David Palmer and the NSA, who call him back in to the CTU and give him 24 hours to infiltrate a terrorist organization that is planning to detonate a dirty bomb in the city of angels. All Jack wants is to get his daughter out of the city, unfortunately Kim's new employer, the abusive father of the child she is nannying, has other ideas.Fans of theoriginalwon't be disappointed, as there are more than enough shock moments in the first few hours to hint at the climactic build-up to come, while newcomers can quickly get involved in the lives of Jack and his family. There are some new characters to bolster the veteran cast and, interestingly (although not surprisingly), Jack's character has taken an altogether darker, more psychopathic turn. The danger the characters find themselves in also has a much more global, not to mention topical, impetus, grounded as it is in the war against terrorism.  Although the territory is more familiar this time around, this second season is just as much a high-tension, taut, adrenalin-fuelled ride as the first, and one that will have you glued to your TV for the next 24 hours.--Kristen Bowditch", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002XVQSU", "B000NDEXK2", "B000B837XI", "B000ICLRKC", "B000NDEXKW", "B000MR8W92", "B001L5SRJE", "B002ZCY7SW", "B001DMVZOE", "B0015QWZ8S", "B002ZCY7TG", "0756632277", "B0001WHXM0", "B00G4RCXPI", "B00KPP6ZLS", "B0000DIJNU", "B000FIMG68", "B000AJJNFE", "B00005JNOG", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B001OQCVFG", "B002N5N5QQ", "B00HT850YW", "B003FSTN52", "B000Q6GUW0", "B0049P1VHS", "B00ECHBSP8", "B004UXVDJA", "B0058YPJ2W", "B00J5LXT44", "B0044E9JU0", "B001GCUER0", "B00IWTVDUW", "B002ZCY8CC", "B0058YPGSY", "B0019L21GA", "B003L77GK6", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00HEPE6MM", "B0024FAR5M", "B00KPP6R9S", "B00005JOC9", "B004EXWGHY", "B00AIBZMD6", "B009LDD1H6", "B000P6YNSE", "B000EWBNMI", "B00ITAQ2T6", "B001AI776G", "B0036EH3XE", "B0089AD8IO", "B000YABIQ6", "B00FGEO9NE", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B009LDCZ7I", "B00IKM5LXG", "B000HEVZ9E", "B003F3NDWG", "B00AB65RUG", "B00HF98SJY", "B000BF0C8E", "B000BGR1B4", "B00E8OMZGG", "B00JA3RVG4"], "bought_together": ["B000NDEXK2", "B0002XVQSU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000NDEXK2", "B000ICLRKC", "B0002XVQSU", "B000MR8W92"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 4639}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 39.69, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B00008YGRU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516918NBNNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "24: Season 2"}

{"description": "The miniseries treatment is suited toDoctor Zhivago, the sprawling Boris Pasternaknovelof a Russian physician-poet whose comfortable life is upended by the Revolution. And this near-four-hour British production lucidly demonstrates that Pasternak was one heck of a storyteller:  the torment of Zhivago (Hans Matheson) as he must choose between his well-bred childhood sweetheart (Alexandra Maria Lara, real comer) and the tragically beautiful Lara (Keira Knightley, fromPirates of the Caribbean) remains compelling. The TV treatment can't match the epic sweep ofDavid Lean's feature film, of course, with its cast of thousands and astonishing production design. Devotees of that 1965 version will undoubtedly yearn for Maurice Jarre's tinkly hit \"Lara's Theme,\" too; here, Ludovico Einaudi's score is serviceable by comparison. Matheson never gets untracked in the title role, but the uncannily gorgeous Knightley and a supremely decadent Sam Neill (as her dreadful seducer) keep their characters vital. The limitations of the small screen duly noted, the frosty location shooting is handsome. Given the choice, see the Lean film on the big screen every time; but this is sturdy introduction to a classic story.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003LMPKSQ", "B008220C38", "B004VHOAGS", "B00006L949", "B001TOCCRU", "B000ERVJPE", "B0077PBPJ6", "B0002XVS6U", "B00104J4IO", "B0026IQTQI", "B001L57ZZG", "B000QGE86K", "B005335K8G", "B00D7AM2QK", "0679407596", "B002PRYL9C", "B001J4E1D8", "B00ARX2VZW", "B0013XZ6X4", "B00EKFI1HA", "B0026IQTOA", "B000089QEM", "B0009PVZM8", "B00H4BHIGW", "B004EQAVHI", "B000BPK2IY", "B000NTM9ZW", "B0009G3B0G", "B008220C56", "B00006JO77", "B00IKM5OTW", "B006ISJQ26", "B00HUAH14Q", "B000M2E32M", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B009L2EW5W", "B00BMQODEU", "B00008DDRZ", "B001PU8N0I", "B009NRQTGU", "B0083HXKMC", "B0080QOL10", "B00005JOA0", "B000E0ODZE", "B009B1EPQ4", "B000A2W1X2", "B005T0OY5S", "0767812115", "0767827775", "B001PUTN3Y", "B00H540M9S", "B00HUTPKA4", "B001P807RC", "B000I2J6WI", "B000Z27HMW", "B000ERVJQ8", "B006PTL1QM", "B000I8OOHE", "B004RIACU4", "B000062XDP", "B0031RAP5O", "B007L6VRBM", "B0077PBPVE", "B0077PBPGO", "B004D45NYC", "B000056KMW", "B00D49YEHO", "B0009OL92K", "B0090XUARQ", "B003CP1T50", "B005CFBZD4", "B004VK742M", "B002CWKTUA", "B001KEHAEE", "B000BNTMKK", "B0046ZYEUW", "6305428115", "B000A8AXXG", "B009ERK0SW", "B000NJL4QC", "B00H4ZEFTQ", "B004XVMCMQ", "B004QDRW0S", "B00E1LT41K", "B004IK30KA", "B0013NAML0", "B005JZBPAK", "B00BBXSP84", "B001B1Q2UO", "B00H4BHIF8", "B00F1BFRA6", "B000EMGF2Q", "B002AMUDJY", "B00J49R1BY", "B00BOTCJXC", "B00B18FA50", "B004SUDQDQ", "B000T28Q00", "B000FQIRXQ", "5489003219"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003LMPKSQ", "B002M2Z3BA", "B008220C38", "B0016K40KY"]}, "price": 7.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 165653}, "asin": "B0000C2IQG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5173D2EBJBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Doctor Zhivago (TV Miniseries)"}

InLoyalty, a peace with France has left Hornblower decommissioned  and short on funds. Only the help of his landlady's daughter Maria  (heartbreaking Julie Sawalha,Absolutely Fabulous) keeps him from  being kicked out into the street.

After  rescuing a supposedly Swiss man and his American wife in a storm,  Hornblower finds himself caught between an old foe in France and diplomats  in England. Though the derring-do is sometimes melodramatic,Horatio  Hornblowerswiftly becomes engrossing and suspenseful.

{"description": "TheAlien Quadrilogyis a nine-disc boxed set devoted to the fourAlienfilms. Although previously available on DVD as theAlien Legacy, here they have been repackaged with vastly more extras and with upgraded sound and picture. For anyone who hasn't been in hypersleep for the last 25 years, this series needs no introduction, though for the first time each film now comes in both original and \"special edition\" form.Alien(1979) was so perfect it didn't need fixing, and Ridley Scott's 2003 director's cut is fiddling for the sake of fiddling. Watch it once, then return to the majestic, perfectly paced original. Conversely, the special edition of James Cameron'sAliens(1986) is the definitive version, though it's nice to finally have the theatrical cut on DVD for comparison. Most interesting is the alternativeAlien 3(1992). This isn't a \"director's cut\"--David Fincher refused to have any involvement with this release--but a 1991 work-print that runs 29 minutes longer than the theatrical version, and has now been restored, remastered, and finished off with (unfortunately) cheap new CGI. Still, it's truly fascinating, offering a different insight into a flawed masterpiece. The expanded opening is visually breathtaking, the central firestorm is much longer, and a subplot involving Paul McGann's character adds considerable depth to story. The ending is also subtly but significantly different.Alien: Resurrection(1997) always was a mess with a handful of brilliant scenes, and the special edition just makes it eight minutes longer.TheAlien Quadrilogyoffers the first and fourth films with DTS soundtracks, the others having still fine Dolby Digital 5.1 presentation. All four films sound fantastic, with much low-level detail revealed for the first time. Each is anamorphically enhanced at the correct original aspect ratio, and the prints and transfers are superlative. Every film offers a commentary track that lends insight into the creative process--though the Scott-only commentary and isolated music score from the firstAlienDVD release are missing here.Each movie is complemented by a separate disc packed with hours of seriously detailed documentaries (all presented in full-screen with clips letterboxed), thousands of photos, production stills, and storyboards, giving a level of inside information for the dedicated buff only surpassed by theLord of the Ringsextended DVD sets. A ninth DVD compiles miscellaneous material, including an hourlong documentary and even all the extras from the oldAlienlaserdisc. \"Exhaustive\" hardly beings to describe theAlien Quadrilogy, a set that establishes the new DVD benchmark for retrospective releases and looks unlikely to be surpassed for some time.--Gary S.

{"description": "A volatile men-in-prison soap opera, fueled by testosterone and lubricated by blood, HBO'sOzis addictive viewing. The third season of the most violent show on cable TV, set in a cage of concrete and steel and glass, opens with echoes of violence past. Miguel Alvarez (Kirk Acevedo) is in solitary confinement for brutally blinding a guard, one-time drug lord Simon Adebissi (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) mourns for his murdered father, and Tobias Beecher (Lee Tergesen) nurses bones broken by Aryan Brotherhood leader Schillinger (J.K. Simmons) and a heart broken by the betrayal of Keller (Law and Order: SVU's Christopher Meloni). Their stories of vengeance, redemption, and forgiveness anchor this season.The show races through each episode with a driving pace that only intensifies the ferocity. But for all the show's physical brutality, the most affecting violence is emotional, from the strange and savage love affair between Beecher and Keller to the escalating war of terror between Beecher and Schillinger. On a lighter note, this season marks the debut of both Miss Sally and new prison CO Sean Murphy (Robert Clohessy), whose understated strength is too often overlooked in the face of the show's more explosive personalities. Season 3 ends pitched on a powder keg, with the fuse in the hands of the show's most ferocious, unpredictable character. It's the kind of promise that will have you slavering for season 4.The three-disc set features all eight episodes along with a season 2 recap, episode recaps and previews, commentary on the episode \"Unnatural Disasters\" by writer-creator Tom Fontana and episode director Chazz Palmintieri, and 22 minutes of deleted scenes.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00031TYBC", "B00000FBH2", "B0009GV9E6", "B000G1R4TS", "B00005Y6YJ", "B00A2JP6V2", "0060521333", "B00G4EWNCO", "B000FTCLSU", "B000QXDJLI", "B00123BY6S", "B004YOEDR4", "B00316DDYA", "B0002ERXC2", "B0006IUD9Y", "B00G4EWJ1O", "B000067S1G", "B0007YMVWO", "B005NFJAWG", "B00KHA99BY", "B00008PW1F", "B0001KL5DA", "B0012CJQY6", "B004BZ5AHI", "B0012CJQYQ", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B003XWEQ8E", "B002FLOTPE", "B0012CJQYG", "B001OQCVFG", "B00005NOHO", "B005LAJ1JA", "B000BO7DWI", "B0015TX2LO", "B00EEDNR9A", "B0024FAD92", "B00B52F278", "B00EIL7E9C", "B008PJZDXW", "B000NA1VI2", "B000UX6TK2", "B00JVLGL7U", "B000XCZGXG", "B0055SNHQG", "B002N5N5QQ", "B0060MYKYY", "B007TBIUSM", "B00DJYJRHG", "B00HW3EXCE", "B0018CWEYY", "B00005JNOG", "B00F9F1K8W", "B0024FAD9C", "B0012CJQZ0", "B00C8CQRQ4", "B00DXP7L88", "B000GH3CWK", "B002N57KGM", "B002ZCY8CC", "B0002I84JO", "B00BVMXBDO", "B00008DP4C", "B003R0MF62", "B0007R4SWM", "B00004XPPB", "B0090XPH06", "B000P6YNSE", "B0028RXXE8", "B0053TWV46", "B00280LZAE", "B005SEDI5M", "B000BO0LKY", "B00FR23PDU", "B003L77GPG", "B0014FAIV6", "B0024FAR5M", "B00HOGBXS6", "B003Y5HWJU", "B00003CXOP", "B000Q6GUW0", "B000FS9MY2", "B0072OFM28", "B0024FAR4I", "B00HI9QGCC", "B0032JTV6A", "B00BGI076M", "B00ECHBSP8", "B000G1R39E", "B008B4KVRE", "B00AHQQHFE", "B0041KKZKA", "B003PIUBZS", "B0002VYOVS", "B0058YPGSY", "B001FB4W0W", "B009LDD54K", "B000TGJ8EY", "B004HW7JMO"], "bought_together": ["B00000FBH2", "B00031TYBC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00000FBH2", "B00005Y6YJ", "B00031TYBC", "B0009GV9E6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 46060}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 39.88, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B0000Y40PW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5113tlVPdhL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Oz: Season 3"}

{"description": "As upscale sitcoms go,Something's Gotta Givehas more to offer than most romantic comedies. Obviously working through some semi-autobiographical issues regarding \"women of a certain age,\" writer-director Nancy Meyers brings adequate credibility and above-average intelligence to what is essentially (but not exclusively) a fantasy premise, in which an aging lothario who's always dated younger women (Jack Nicholson, more or less playing himself) falls for a successful middle-aged playwright (Diane Keaton) who's convinced she's past the age of romance, much less sexual re-awakening. As long as old pals Nicholson and Keaton are on screen discussing their dilemma or discovering their mutual desire,Something's Gotta Giveis terrific, proving (in case anyone had forgotten) that Hollywood can and should aim for an older demographic. Myers falls short with the sitcom device of a younger lover (Keanu Reeves) who wants Keaton as much as Nicholson does; it's believable but shallow and too easily dismissed. Myers also skimps on supporting roles for Frances McDormand, Amanda Peet, and Jon Favreau, but thankfully this is one romantic comedy that doesn't pander to youth. Mature viewers, rejoice!--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0038N9WKU", "0767811100", "B000MQC9H4", "B000YAF4MA", "B000OCZA04", "B0038N9X40", "B00AEFXYOA", "B00AEBB9WI", "B0000YTP1G", "B00AEBB8YW", "B000EMGJ7C", "B000YDBPAM", "B0000VD02Y", "B000023VTP", "B000EHRVOW", "B0009OL7Z4", "B00005JLSK", "B000XJD33O", "B0000542C9", "B00AEBB8NS", "B001ECDVK4", "B00006FMUW", "6304765266", "B004SEUJK0", "B003ASLJK4", "B0000AOV4I", "6305236569", "B002VECM6S", "B002K0WBXW", "B00008G7UF", "B000J103OI", "B0042816YK", "B00081U7HC", "6305213283", "B004SIP9RO", "B003BV8ICC", "B0015I2RT8", "078322740X", "6305212112", "B008R65XWO", "6305657947", "B0017ANAZO", "B0000JBALO", "B00EIBO8T6", "B00AEFYHVO", "B00005JNDZ", "B0099114WO", "B0088X7Z6S", "B007JNR54A", "B00005JPSM", "076784744X", "B002ZG988M", "B00386EZKE", "B000683VI4", "B00AEBB9FA", "B004EPZ070", "B00003CXSM", "B00AEFY99O", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00005JG6N", "0783226772", "B000JYW5B4", "B003Y5H574", "B0038N9X3Q", "B002GHHHGU", "B000CCW2P2", "B00004TJKK", "B0017ANB08", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B000P0J0EW", "B004SIP8LG", "B000A343RI", "079073219X", "B0045HCJJ4", "B000CCBCAS", "B000HEWEE4", "0792833198", "B000765IJK", "B0002I84N0", "B001DDBCUA", "6304907729", "B003Y5H524", "B000ENC5YW", "B0007IO6NM", "B005S9EJ14", "B004FQX5B6", "B000HEWEJO", "B0001I55M4", "B00003CXFV", "B00005JLH0", "B00DDT0JB0", "B002U4UYYQ", "B00DW5ILUG", "B00005JN3W", "B00006ZXSO", "B00007E2F5", "B004SIP9VA", "B00118T632", "B004A8ZWSS"], "bought_together": ["B0038N9WKU", "B000MQC9H4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0038N9WKU", "0767811100", "B000MQC9H4", "B00AEBB9WI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2886}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.79, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0001AVZA8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q5RC1103L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Something's Gotta Give"}

{"description": "Whatever footage those omnipresent cameras caught of the medical and substance abuse travails that landed the Osbournes in the tabloids and the gossip columns must have wound up on the cutting room floor. Instead, these 10 episodes that concluded the Emmy-nominated season 2 amp the Osbournes' hysterical dysfunctions to 11. The internecine warfare between siblings Jack and Kelly goes Fallujah in \"What a Boy Wants\" and \"Fists of Fury,\" an episode that, according to one website, features 135 bleeped obscenities, which must be a series benchmark. But in time-honored, reassuring sitcom convention, family ties are reinforced by episode's end. When the dust has settled in \"Fists,\" Jack and Kelly bond in the kitchen over Easy Mac. Nothing unites the fractious Osbournes like obnoxious neighbors, but in \"Tennis Racket,\" not even Jack's drumming or Ozzy's stereo blasts can stop their incessant tennis-playing neighbors. Jack enjoys something of a breakout half season. He turns 17 and goes Medieval (Times) in \"What a Boy Wants.\" He hooks up with Kurt Cobain's sister in \"A Little Ditty About Jack and Brianne\" (which also features the surreal sight of a panty-clad Courtney Love reciting Shakespeare!).  Another snapshot for the Osbourne family album is Ozzy and Jack disrupting a fishing trip by lobbing firecrackers at birds in \"Angler Management.\" Throughout, Ozzy is his delightful, addled self. In \"Run Ozzy Run,\" his new car's voice-recognition system can't understand him (for viewers with the same problem, this DVD includes the helpful Ozzy Translator).

{"description": "No actor works harder to open a movie than Tom Cruise. His enthusiasm is throughout the DVD extras as he mirrors his samurai character by constantly talking about \"loyalty\" and \"discipline\" while working on the film. However as a post-movie experience, the top-line extras with Cruise and director Edward Zwick are repetitive and underwhelming, with too many clips from the film we assume DVD viewers have just seen. The History Channel show is also a pre-release promotional device that misses an opportunity to really dig into this intriguing time period. Better are segments on the costumes, the production design, and how you put together an Imperial army--in New Zealand, no less. Zwick's low-key and dense commentary (plus a \"Video Journal\") is not vital, but he illustrates many of the little peculiarities it took to make the wide-ranging film come together. There are two deleted scenes; a samurai's first appearance is particularly memorable.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFY5B6", "B002O3Z50Q", "B00004XPPG", "B00AMSLDTM", "B0002YLCG0", "B0000DZTIW", "B000AARKOO", "B000QXDED6", "B003U0AHBO", "B00AEFXKUI", "B000A2WP7O", "B008MIMWOY", "B00AEBBA36", "B004AOECXI", "6305692688", "B000MGB6NM", "B0000TANUI", "079283366X", "B00005JL78", "B000W1SZBS", "B004SIP88Y", "B0034G4P58", "B001TUZG4K", "B00AS1Q93S", "B000MRA592", "B00001ZWUS", "B000E5N6LG", "B000XR9L50", "B0001HLVS2", "B00HEPDGKA", "B003ASLJO0", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000P0J0EW", "B0000A2ZNX", "B00005JNTI", "B0018QPPXW", "B000065U1N", "B000095WW8", "B0002WZTOI", "B002VWNIEA", "B004U7MQWY", "B002VWNID6", "B008JFUO36", "B00AEBB86A", "B00005JN0W", "B0007Q6VXC", "B001LRJH0U", "B000MZHW40", "B0002IQMAM", "B00004WG2F", "B003INBO3I", "B000EHRVMY", "B000NOKFHQ", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEFXVCU", "B000YENUI6", "B000M341QE", "B0000YEEGM", "B001680M26", "B008R65XYC", "B002ZG99QS", "B00008K76U", "B000HRMAPE", "B007TBKAXK", "B00000G3PA", "0767810856", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00AEFXYJA", "B002T9H2LA", "B000P0J0AG", "B00003CXZ1", "B000O599YO", "B000FS9FCG", "6304711905", "B00AEFXRRO", "B000HRMAUY", "B001ILHY1I", "B002NZK5V4", "B002VWNICC", "B000VKL6ZM", "B001UDS4BS", "B002ZG997C", "B004SIP8ZM", "0800177967", "B0001O3YD0", "B00005ATZT", "B004XFZ3UU", "B00004Z4WR", "B005LAIH2W", "B0007TKNGA", "B00000JQB5", "B0012Q732O", "B002ZG97RE", "B0002VEUV2", "0800141741", "B002ZG977Y", "B00005N5S3", "B00008G8M4", "B0000B1OFL"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFY5B6", "B00004XPPG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000QXDED6", "B00BEJL6JK", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00JU949TK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 121880}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 17.25, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001JXOUS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EdSWs9r9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Last Samurai (Full Screen Edition)"}
{"description": "Thirty Helens agree:The Kids in the Hallis a funny show. (Mr. Tyzik, the bitter Head Crusher, however, may not agree.) The no-holds-barred sketch comedy is also strange, silly, profane--occasionally even profound. The five Canadian writer-comedians behind it, Dave Foley (NewsRadio), Bruce McCulloch (Superstar), Kevin McDonald (That ''70s Show), Mark McKinney (Saturday Night Live), and Scott Thompson (The Larry Sanders Show), formed the troupe in the early 1980s. Naturally, they weren't really kids, but boyish-looking men in their twenties and thirties.SNL's Lorne Michaels produced the series, which lasted for five seasons, and aired on HBO, Comedy Central, and Canada's CBC. It garnered three Emmy nominations and was followed by the theatrical cult classicThe Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy(1996) and several tours.The Toronto-based team took more inspiration from the absurdity ofMonty Python--and the craziness inherent in everyday life--than the topical humor ofSNL(on which celebrities, politicians, and pop culture are frequent targets). Each 30-minute installment features short, punchy skits (some filmed in advance, some before a live audience), men in drag, and no special guest hosts or stars (musical or otherwise). During their small-screen rein, the Kids took aim at everything from mainstream comedy and corporate culture to sexism, bigotry, and pretension. Many of their best-loved characters first appeared during the 20 episodes produced between 1989-1990. They include the 30 Helens (30 Helens standing in a field agreeing about something or other), Tyzik (McKinney), rockin' Bobby (McCulloch), bickering Fran and Gordon (Thompson and McCulloch), chatty Cathy and Kathie (McCulloch and Thompson), the \"Nobody Likes Us\" guys (Foley and MacDonald), and the acerbic Buddy Cole (Thompson).Canadian underground heroes Shadowy Men on a Shadowy Planet provided the icing on their spicy little cake with their wistful surf-rock theme \"Having an Average Weekend.\"--Kathleen C.

{"description": "The epic sci-fi seriesBabylon 5was a unique experiment in the history of television. It was effectively a novel for television in five seasons, consisting of 110 episodes with a clear beginning, middle, and end. The first season introduces the main characters, headed this year by Commander Jeffery Sinclair (Michael O'Hare) and Security Chief Michael Garibaldi (Jerry Doyle), and familiarizes the audience with the unique environment of a five-mile-long space station in the year 2257. The first episode, \"Midnight on the Firing Line,\" plays at a breathless pace, introducing Commander Susan Ivanova (Claudia Christian) and establishing the conflict between the Narn and Centauri races as represented by their ambassadors, G'Kar (Andreas Katsulas) and Londo Mollari (Peter Jurasik).B5hits warp speed with a run of exceptional episodes building to the season finale. The two-part \"Voice in the Wilderness\" has Mars breaking into open revolt against Earth and the  discovery of a \"Great Machine\" on the dead world Epsilon 3. Referencing 1950s sci-fi classicForbidden Planet, the story leads to the superb time-travel-based \"Babylon Squared.\" Season finale \"Chrysalis\" proves more than just the usual television cliffhanger, placing Minbari ambassador Delenn in conflict with her ruling Grey Council and forcing on her a decision that laid the groundwork forBabylon 5's eventually becoming a great love story.Delenn's future love interest, Captain John Sheridan (Bruce Boxleitner) arrived onBabylon 5in the first episode of season 2, \"Points of Departure.\" The show marked the handing over of command of B5 to Sheridan from Commander Jeffery Sinclair, actor Michael O'Hare becoming a victim of studio politicians who wanted a bigger star in the leading role. \"Revelations\" explains that Sheridan's wife, Anna, died during an archaeological survey of the world Z'ha'dum, the name being just one of many references to Tolkien'sThe Lord of the Rings(the bridge at Khazad-Dum). \"The Coming of Shadows\" proved to beBabylon 5's finest hour to date, and in \"In the Shadow of Z'ha'dum,\" Sheridan learns that Morden was on the ship on which Anna died. Three exceptional shows conclude the season. The Narn-Centauri war escalates in \"The Long, Twilight Struggle,\" Sheridan faces a most unusual ordeal in \"Comes the Inquisitor,\" and in \"The Fall of Night\" all hope of peace is shattered as a nerve-racking assassination attempt reveals a startling secret about Ambassador Kosh.\"Matters of Honor\" launchedBabylon 5's third season with the introduction of theWhite Star, a spacecraft added to enable more of the action to take place away from the station. Also introduced was Marcus Cole (Jason Carter)--in another nod toThe Lord of the Rings, a Ranger not so far removed from Tolkien's Strider. A third of the way through the season \"Messages from Earth,\" \"Point of No Return,\" and \"Severed Dreams\" prove pivotal, changing the nature of the story in a way previously unimaginable on network TV. Earth slides into dictatorship, the fascistic Nightwatch takes control of off-world security, and Sheridan take decisive action by declaringBabylon 5independent.  \"Interludes and Examinations\" presented the death of a major supporting character, while the two-part \"War Without End\" reached apocalyptic dimensions in a complex tale resolving the destiny of Sinclair and the fate ofBabylon 4, resolving a 1,000-year-old paradox and presenting a vision of a very dark future for Sheridan and Delenn. All this was trumped by the monumental \"Z'ha'dum.\" In the preceding \"Shadow Dancing\" Anna Sheridan (Melissa Gilbert, Bruce Boxleitner's real-life wife) returned from the dead, no longer entirely human. In the mythologically resonant climax Anna invited Sheridan back to the Shadow homeworld with no hope of survival. Just as inThe Lord of the RingsGandalf fell into the abyss at Khazad-Dum, so Sheridan took a comparable leap into the unknown on an alien world.Season 4 began on a high point with the Centauri Prime in the grip of the insane Emperor Cartagia (Wortham Krimmer) and a run of six shows leading to the climax of the war against the Shadows in \"Into the Fire.\" If this colossal narrative was resolved a little too easily and the ultimate aim of the Shadows turned out to be a tad disappointing, it still proved to be the most powerful slice of space opera to ever grace the small screen. In the aftermath the sheer scale dropped back a little but the pace never slowed as the rest of the season played out in one relentless cycle of conspiracy, betrayal and conflict,Babylon 5siding with the rebel Mars colony against the totalitarian Earth.  On an unstoppable wave fuelled by roller-coaster plot twists and spectacular action shows from \"No Surrender, No Retreat\"--when Sheridan avows to overthrow EarthGov--to \"Rising Star\"--when the aim is realized--Babylon 5achieved a consistent excellence rare in television.The final season found Claudia Christian departed and Ivanova replaced by Captain Elizabeth Lochley (Tracy Scoggins), who in a soap-opera twist turned out to be Sheridan's first wife. Sheridan was promoted to President of the Interstellar Alliance and the action moved to a group of telepaths seeking sanctuary from the PSI-Corp onB5. Meanwhile the aftermath of the Shadow War was explored, and as usual the season picked up toward the end, with a string of fine political episodes. The final episode, \"Sleeping in Light,\" was directed by J. Michael Straczynski and made an epilogue to the series. Set 20 years later, after all the sound and fury this quiet, elegiac tale is the apotheosis of the love story that proved the balance to the tragedy of the preceding darkness. A personal story resolved against a background of the epic, at once transcendent, deeply human, and profoundly optimistic, \"Sleeping in Light\" is as moving as any hour in the history of television drama and a thoroughly satisfying conclusion to one of the greatest series ever made.--Gary S.

{"description": "Greatest movie star ever? How can you argue against Cary Grant, the graceful clown, the ironic romantic? Equally at home in an Alfred Hitchcock suspense piece or a Howard Hawks screwball comedy, the superb Mr. Grant (born Archie Leach) could handle just about anything. And it's a testament to his appeal that this boxed set, which contains not a single great movie, is nevertheless an entertaining catalog of Grant's splendid run during the 1940s.The earliest picture, and a sheer delight, is 1940'sMy Favorite Wife, one of Grant's blissful pairings with the wonderful Irene Dunne. He's about to remarry when his first wife washes up again after having been lost on a desert island (with he-man Randolph Scott) for seven years.Destination Tokyois a WWII submarine picture, with Grant as the stalwart skipper--slightly odd casting, but he brings it off with admirable professionalism. (The film's propagandistic jabs at demonizing the Japanese enemy have not aged well.)Night and Dayis one of those composer biographies that veers rather radically from reality, with Grant playing Cole Porter. A ton of great songs and the canny casting of Cary as the champagne-sophisticate Porter make it passably de-lovely, despite the whitewash of the composer's real-life story.The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxerputs Grant in deliciously antic mode, mooned over by teenager Shirley Temple but preferring the company of her older sister, Myrna Loy. He re-teams with Loy inMr. Blandings Builds His Dream House, an artless but regularly hilarious tale of Manhattanites whose Connecticut fixer-upper becomes a money pit.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000CEV3L4", "B000HA4WS4", "B000F7CMRC", "B0007OY2PS", "B000A8AX6I", "B0002Y4TJM", "B00B4NLCEU", "B00AEBB97S", "B000HWZ4EI", "B000FZETSY", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B000MTEFV4", "B001KXZGNW", "B0009HLD3C", "B000FFJYAW", "B0009S4IJM", "B00008ZZ7B", "B00C3ALLFS", "B004GJYR7I", "B0045HCJ9E", "B000FTCLRQ", "B000085EFE", "B000UJCAK4", "B0045HCJHG", "B002C4N9BE", "B002BZX0JK", "B00114XLTQ", "B0007TKNKQ", "B001D8W7EK", "B000059ZTM", "B0016MOWPU", "B000GIXLVQ", "B0000DD780", "B0000DD77V", "B0002Y4TNI", "B000GIXLUW", "B002GSXKQA", "B0007939PW", "B000ION7A8", "B000M2E31I", "B000WMA6HS", "B0008ENID4", "B000NTPG70", "B001ASQ9OC", "B00023P4RY", "B00CZ7AL32", "B001FBNQYA", "B004K4FUT8", "B000ION7AI", "B0024FAG7Q", "B008CZDVA6", "B00AATV046", "B00004VVMZ", "B006TTC5WC", "B00347AIMG", "B00KIZYDCI", "B000054OT4", "B000244F2S", "B000XNZ7NO", "B00114XLUU", "B000083C8K", "B0045HCJQW", "B003G9IT3C", "B0024FAG8A", "B00FC1ZC9Q", "B001QFFBAM", "B000KNL2DQ", "B00114XLUA", "B00008MTYC", "B002GSXKPQ", "B00COHGPNS", "B000FTCLSK", "B008D1Q1VU", "B006E8ZXZ4", "B0002HOEPS", "B0011FDVEK", "B000P2A22O", "B001GUYAZY", "B000A0GOEQ", "B0041T50J2", "B000FKO3V2", "B0090XK9FO", "B00157OICS", "B00005JO4D", "B0047O2FPI", "B0071U3MRA", "B00BTYU3ZS", "B000F0UUHS", "B0037RBVLU", "B006H37P2K", "B0090XPGUM", "B00BY8DAAE", "B000WTVZHQ", "B0013LL2XE", "B000JJSJPK", "B00CZ7AKHY", "B0012Q3T5O", "B001IHJ97O", "B00007GZR1", "B0047BXQZY"], "bought_together": ["B000CEV3L4", "B000HA4WS4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008D1Q1VU", "B0045HCJHG", "B000CEV3L4", "B00C3ALLFS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 97901}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 31.7, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001WTWYW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VoJtI-q0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Cary Grant Signature Collection (Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House / Destination Tokyo / The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer / My Favorite Wife / Night and Day)"}

{"description": "Dallas: The Complete First and Second Seasonsis an American equivalent to those British miniseries about historical chapters in that country's royal monarchy. Full of family in-fighting, political intrigue crossed with personal triumph or disappointment, and plenty of sensational infidelities and betrayals,Dallasis a captivating story of a wealthy oil family's power and travails. It is also uniquely fun and daringly absurd, albeit with a straight face; this hugely successful, primetime soap opera began in the late 1970s and ran 14 seasons in all, built on a handful of primary relationships that stretch credulity but never descend into self-parody.Not unexpectedly,Dallasbegins with a Romeo and Juliet tale that instantly exposes an old feud between two families and strips the civilized veneer from several major characters. Bobby Ewing (Patrick Duffy), youngest of three sons of independent oilman Jock Ewing (Jim Davis), arrives at the Ewing clan's Southfork ranch just outside Dallas, Texas, with a new wife, Pam Barnes Ewing (Victoria Principal). Pam is the daughter of Digger Barnes (David Wayne), an old business rival of Jock's and one-time suitor of the Ewing matriarch, Eleanor (or \"Miss Ellie,\" played by Barbara Bel Geddes). Pam's also the sister of a state senator, Cliff Barnes (Ken Kercheval), whose vendetta against the Ewings is played out in the legislature, imposing costly regulations on their business and holding committee investigations into questionable practices of company president J.R. Ewing (Larry Hagman). Pam's status as the newest Ewing causes an uproar in the family (besides being a Barnes, she also dated the Ewings' genial but lonely foreman, Ray Krebbs, played by Steve Kanaly) and promptsDallas' charming villain, J.R., to make many Iago-like attempts, over the first two seasons, to drive her from Bobby's arms. Pam has a different set of problems with the other, jealous Ewing women, including J.R.'s possibly barren and alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), and teenage Lucy (Charlene Tilton), daughter of exiled Ewing son Gary (Ted Shackleford). With new and old resentments flying and everyone deeply suspicious of everyone else's motives (even the ailing Jock doesn't trust J.R.), there's plenty of drama to chew on.

As the title suggests, the action takes place in five distinct episodes, but sometimes many years separate the seasons. The setting is a floating monastery in a pristine mountain lake, where an elderly monk teaches a boy the lessons of life--although when the boy grows to manhood, he inevitably must learn a few hard lessons for himself. By the time the story reaches its final sections, you realize you have witnessed the arc of existence--not one person's life, but everyone's. It's as enchanting as a Buddhist fable, but it's not precious; Kim (maker of the notoriousThe Isle) consistently surprises you with a sex scene or an explosion of black comedy; he also vividly acts in the Winter segment, when the lake around the monastery eerily freezes.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000A1OFZA", "B000LPS3A8", "B000S76VHQ", "B0001611CO", "B0000203Z5", "B0009XRZQK", "B005ZOFJNE", "B006C1S1DY", "B00BTFK014", "B00C6F61MS", "B0010SAGHS", "B0009X75HO", "B00008QS9I", "B0053TWVUU", "B000FZEQDC", "B0009ETDCI", "6305090580", "B002P7UCJK", "B0006VL1J2", "B000A5044C", "B000GBEWNY", "B002SF9YNO", "B000059TON", "B00AN5LCXQ", "B000C65YNK", "B004SEUJEG", "B00C6F60NI", "B003Y7F1IW", "B004PXIQDQ", "B003JDQJM8", "B000I8OOG0", "B008XSDTA4", "B00002RAPT", "B0000C2IW7", "B000GSYRY6", "B000V02CUU", "B0019PL2W0", "B000BRBA8S", "B000WMEB1A", "B004CGUBZW", "B000ARG2RI", "B00C7CKEP0", "B0007Q6VXC", "B003DBYCR0", "B000GBEWPC", "B00005JLV7", "B004H2CXBQ", "B000EAT23M", "B000E1EHPE", "B000RTCSIQ", "B00104AYGK", "B0012GVMIK", "6305428360", "B00005JKG1", "B00065GX0K", "B002MZCSW4", "B00004STDA", "B004JOBTRQ", "B00HRJVHEK", "B004CIIXDM", "B008ULEIKO", "B00061I29E", "B0000633R6", "B00005JM6H", "B00023P4N8", "B000065V38", "B00005QFE5", "B00C6WHPO4", "B0007XG5HW", "B003NLE5JA", "B002U4F5W2", "B005JJCMN0", "B001EAV3R4", "B008N9AASC", "B000EOTWIS", "B00003CXUM", "B0009S2T0M", "B0087OULO6", "B00005JKGK", "B0002IRYTA", "B00GX33J7E", "B00166UFA2", "B0033XUHAO", "6305257450", "B00005YRQ2", "B0086460G0", "B0009WIE2A", "B00005JLQW", "6305972761", "B000MRA592", "B008MPQ0R2", "B00HVOFP6W", "B0009VND0E", "B00C6WHSRI", "B00K0MM4AM", "B0009KA2UO", "B00000IOKV", "B00GA9F2PI", "B000AQ68Y6", "B00HE011DE"], "bought_together": ["B000A1OFZA", "B000LPS3A8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000A1OFZA", "B00008QS9I", "B000LPS3A8", "B00AN5LCOA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 92921}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 17.99, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0002J4X20", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516%2BBSVCpCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"}
{"description": "Guest stars and more guest stars seem to be the theme ofSanford and Son's very funny fifth season (1975-1976). The 25 episodes feature a parade of celebrities supporting stars Redd Foxx and Demond Wilson in guest and recurring roles, including John Larroquette and Robert Guillaume inSteinberg and Son, a TV sitcom based on Fred and Lamont's life; Marlene Clark as Lamont's girlfriend June; Nancy (The Beverly Hillbillies) as Officer Hoppy's overprotective mom; and George Foreman, Merv Griffin, Steve Lawrence, and Eydie Gorme as themselves. The other addition to the series comes with the introduction of the Sanford Arms, a apartment built on former neighbor Julio's place, and which comes complete with a host of eccentric guests (the hotel, along withSanfordstars LaWanda Page and Don Bexley, would be the focus of its own short-lived sitcom followingSanford and Son's cancellation in 1977).Otherwise, it's business as usual at Fred and Lamont's junkyard, with the pair getting involved in bank robberies, earthquakes, and escort services, while still finding time to go camping (in the season finale, written by Garry Shandling). The sheer amount of laughs offered by season 5 was a strong reminder of why the show had remained so popular for four seasons; unfortunately, time slot changes and the disinterest of both leads would spell the show's demise only one season later.

The frankness of the director's approach to sex does not prepare one for the shock of the truly bleak final reels. ThisLast TangoinZabrieskie Pointhas a lulling, creepy power before it reaches those shocks, although actors David Wissak and Katia Golubeva are perhaps not as compelling as Dumont wants them to be.

You've got the final two films in the \"It's Alive\" trilogy of terror, filmmaker Larry Cohen's cautionary cult-fave shockers that suggest that humankind's environmental meddling might lead to monstrous, mutated, born-to-kill offspring. What began as a lone little hellion in \"It's Alive\" grows more numerous when \"It Lives Again.\" Frederic Forrest and Kathleen Lloyd play parents who realize that perhaps the only way to stop the mutants' deadly spree is to become the bait for their own monster/child. In \"It's Alive III: Island of the Alive,\" the now global terrors are rounded up and relocated to a far-flung island - but not for long.

{"description": "The rough-edged vitality of contemporary Irish filmmaking is readily apparent inIntermission, a deliriously ambitious black comedy in which 54 characters and 11 plotlines compete for consistently impressive screen-time. In a dazzling display of audacity, screenwriter Mark O'Rowe and first-time director John Crowley jump from one plot to another, tangling their characters in an infectious series of intersecting events, shifting from scenes of brutal violence, poignant compassion, and richly dark humor, and somehow managing to make it all fit together in a miraculously coherent tapestry of romance, crime, and authentic Dublin atmosphere. Colin Farrell andStar Trek: Deep Space Ninealumnus Colm Meaney are the familiar stars here, and they're in peak form on native soil, but the entire cast shines in equal measure, all of them playing malcontents striving for something better in a world that's simultaneously harsh and hilarious.

Dushku plays Tru Davies, a young morgue attendant who discovers, much to her dismay, that she can hear the voices of the dead, as well as reverse their fates; with the help of her brother (Shawn Reaves) and boss (Zack Galifianakis), Tru relives the last day of these people's lives in order to prevent their untimely deaths.Episodic highlights include \"Valentine,\" which pits Tru against a serial killer; \"Closure,\" in which a young war hero attempts to reunite with his girlfriend after his death; \"Murder in the Morgue,\" which revolves around the killing of a bride on her wedding day; and \"Daddy's Girl,\" which reveals some disturbing news regarding Tru's past and introduces Jason Priestley as the sinister-seeming Jack Harper, a man with powers similar to hers, but with very different intentions regarding the recently deceased. The six-disc set includes all 20 episodes of the first season (including the two-part finale), several featuring commentary by Dushku, Reaves, and the producers; deleted scenes, an Easter Egg featuring Zach Galifianakis' audition (accessible from the featurette \"Finding The Calling: The Pilot\"), and a music video for Full Blown Rose's theme song, \"Can Somebody Help Me,\" round out the extras.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000AO9BSS", "B0024FAR66", "B000O77SMW", "B000O77SN6", "B002JVWR4U", "B00133QNRW", "B0013DZNAA", "B000SMNL92", "B00133QNS6", "B0012IX35S", "B000I0QLQY", "B000I0QLR8", "B0051GOB2G", "B001MVWRNE", "B00133QNSG", "B0011UBDS6", "B000T9OP7G", "B00170LCWC", "B000EHSVM8", "B0000V4910", "B000EHSVMS", "B000GG4Y28", "B000N3T0EG", "B000EHSVKK", "B003UD7J26", "B0081QF6Q8", "B000QUEQ4U", "B0019F02XK", "B000I0QLRI", "B003LXM1PK", "B000EHSVLE", "B000EHSVN2", "B004YPED14", "B0037AGB9O", "B001G0MFLU", "B00AMDA2QC", "B0006IUE16", "B0038MUZ3E", "B001MVWRNO", "B000FUTVPA", "B000EHSVLY", "B006LG74Q0", "B00022FWEU", "B001AQO43M", "B0016MOWQ4", "B0002S94BQ", "B000AJJNFE", "B002U0KHME", "B000EHSVL4", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B00J49R0JW", "B0001907BC", "B000QDLSR0", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B000JLTRIG", "B000G6BL88", "B001B7CNZ6", "B00008EYBH", "B000OIOPHC", "B002QU1Z1K", "B00HUPC5X8", "B001G0MFE2", "B000GG4Y6O", "B000I0QLRS", "B000FS9MY2", "B000NOKFGW", "B003UD7JEE", "B000FKO3GW", "B002QZDSW4", "B000RO6JZY", "B0018CWEZI", "B0009JE6FC", "B00CD45JBG", "B002BWP2IK", "B001ILFUA0", "B008CJ0KBU", "B001QOGY54", "B0009JE6FM", "B00BVMXBDO", "B00005JLEY", "B000MX7V66", "B001DF681G", "B002CLKP00", "B001OQCVCE", "B000CCBCGM", "B000SO7LQO", "B000P12LWY", "B000FJH5M2", "B0001906X6", "B00CKJJ1G8", "B000B8IA08", "B001MVWRN4", "B0009QTRVI", "B002N5N5MK", "B00062IDEW", "B001FB4VYE", "B000KLQUMG", "B000EWBNMS", "B000YAA2SQ", "B001MVWRMU"], "bought_together": ["B000AO9BSS", "B0024FAR66"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00191AEYQ", "B0024FAR66", "B000O77SN6", "B000O77SMW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 51194}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 43.86, "brand": "Tru", "asin": "B0002XVKMM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51A0J1EQK9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tru Calling: Season 1"}

{"description": "The bonus material is comprised of nine 4-6 minutes featurettes on various aspects of the production, giving insight on how the selection of director Paul Greengrass--with his documentary, impromptu methods--led to the film's much-talked-about style. The most interesting are about how they blow up things (without a computer) and a look at the Go Mobile, a new rig to capture a car chase on film.

{"description": "The first and only spin-off ofBabylon 5, J. Michael Straczynski's short-lived sci-fi seriesCrusadehad its roots in theB5television movieA Call to Arms, in which Earth was battling a Drakh invasion at the end of the Shadow Wars. WhenCrusadebegins, the Drakh have released a deadly virus that threatens to wipe out all 10 billion humans living on Earth unless a cure can be found in five years. To take on this monumental task, Captain Matthew Gideon (Gary Cole) is assigned command of the state-of-the-art Destroyer-class shipExcalibur. His crew includes telepath John Matheson (Daniel Dae Kim); pompous but brilliant archaeologist-linguist Max Eilerson (David Allen Brooks); Dureena, a member of the Thieves' Guild and the last surviving member of her species (Carrie Dobro); medical officer Sarah Chambers (Marjean Holden); and technomage Galen (Peter Woodward).WhileBabylon 5had five years to develop into a powerful saga,Crusadehad its plug pulled after a mere 13 episodes (which were reordered for TNT's broadcast), and the series never really got its footing. Galen often took center stage, then disappeared for several episodes. Matheson was underutilized (other than to provide fans with clues about what happened in the Psi-Wars afterB5ended), and tough-guy Gideon bounced back and forth between his desire to save the human race and his own moral code. There were some good action scenes and intriguing concepts (developed in conjunction with the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory). Special effects sometimes were impressive and sometimes showed budget constraints, and we never really saw the power and scope of the mile-and-a-half-long ship, other than the cool bullet cars used to traverse its length. But it did have its moments. IfB5was the spiritual companion toStar Trek: Deep Space Ninewith its space-station setting and long story arc,Crusadewas more like a traditionalStar Treksetting, with mostly stand-alone episodes involving first contact with various species (even if, due to the nature of theExcalibur's quest, such species were usually extinct). And there were occasional tantalizing hints of a broader conspiracy that might have allowed the series to soar. Regardless,B5fans will welcome even a brief opportunity to revisit this universe, especially when theExcaliburvisits the station in \"The Rules of the Game.\" John Sheridan's ex-wife Captain Elizabeth Lochley (Tracy Scoggins) even earned a spot in the opening credits for her appearance in a few episodes.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004EXWGHY", "B000CEXFYW", "B000PHX8RA", "B002DUJ9Q6", "B002BAW6GS", "B002BAW6H2", "B002BAW6FY", "B002BAW6GI", "B002BAW6FE", "B000JLTRHW", "B000ELL1QC", "B000BCCAEQ", "B00F3L8P26", "B0009JE6G6", "B00005NTNP", "B00404ME2E", "B003H9LIU2", "B0009JE6FM", "B006LPHY6G", "B006P2TA44", "B000FIHN8O", "B001RHGRTS", "B000FJH5M2", "B0006FO9B0", "B001DF681G", "B00KC57IWG", "B000E5N6B6", "B007AFC0W4", "B000FOPPBA", "B004HYW84G", "B001DW2BG0", "B003Y7JWZ0", "B004TJ1H3C", "B0051GOB2G", "B0048FUUAI", "B003ZFC9M4", "B003H9LIRK", "B008R52LA2", "B0042YZFYG", "B0041B77RS", "B00IWTVDUW", "B00402FGE4", "B000BOH8Y6", "B000BR9SA0", "B00BN0WQ5I", "B00GX7D5G0", "B0000V4910", "B00A3718IS", "B000HCO8KE", "B002ZCY872", "B0015LPS1Y", "B002USF1UO", "B00E688AZE", "B00466H3A4", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B003BV8I7C", "B000W4KT9G", "B002GP7ZWI", "B004LROMWU", "B00K2CHWYI", "B00465I156", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00HUPC5X8", "B003PGNBO8", "B00170LCWC", "B0057FGD3Q", "B000WLU5ZM", "B00062RCC6", "B001RTCP1U", "B00L4K3MLE", "B00023BKMC", "B004LROMS4", "B002CLKP00", "B0000AQS0F", "B00KO7NUWO", "B000WTZ6SK", "B00E0KY62O", "B003R0MEYA", "B0007CEXUY", "B00HXEWECI", "B00E688720", "B00E3QJ7JC", "B00K2CHVSK", "B000V5IP6K", "B00ECXJC28", "B002VA5A02", "0345427173", "B00A3717C0", "B002U0KHME", "B00J82PU92", "0739414852", "B00KM5F31O", "B000FJH5MC", "B001RXDM2M", "B001EN71CW", "B002HRF7AW", "B0041OOSMC", "B007XF0XVQ", "B008XJM6H0", "B00HWWUQYY"], "bought_together": ["B004EXWGHY", "B002DUJ9Q6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004EXWGHY", "B002BAW6H2", "B002DUJ9Q6", "B00F3L8P26"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6775}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 15.69, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B00061QJSK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ATW37CMGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Crusade: The Complete Series"}

Indeed, this miniseries (originally broadcast over two nights on the Sci-Fi Channel) will likely appeal primarily to theFarscapefaithful, as the somewhat convoluted storyline may prove baffling to the uninitiated.A brief bit of backstory explains how John Crichton, an astronaut from Earth, went through a wormhole and ended up on Moya, a living spaceship, with a motley group of aliens, including D'Argo (Anthony Simcoe), Chiana (Gigi Edgley), various puppet characters (designed by the Jim Henson Company), and Aeryn (Claudia Black), Crichton's love interest, who's expecting their first child. AsThe Peacekeeper Warsbegins, our heroes find themselves in the middle of a war-to-end-all-wars between the lizard-like, implacably evil Scarrans and their rivals, the Peacekeepers. Crichton is the lynchpin in all of this, as his knowledge of \"wormhole technology\" is coveted by all, including his old nemesis Scorpius (Wayne Pygram), who captured and tortured Crichton back in season 1 and with whom Crichton must now form an uneasy alliance against the Scarrans.Over the course of the three-hour miniseries, we get lots of weird- and cool-looking aliens, some nice sets and special effects, plenty of battles, and lots of portentous talk about the fate of the universe--nothing especially original, but all presented with outstanding production values. There's drama and action, love and betrayal, tragedy and triumph, war and, ultimately, peace, with a suitably spectacular ending (and a nod to Stanley Kubrick's2001: A Space Odyssey). With a 30-minute \"making of\" documentary among the DVD special features,The Peacekeeper Warsis a fitting way to end theFarscapesaga.--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00E688AZE", "B00E688720", "B002GP7ZWI", "B00GHH9GPU", "B00G5UR0SO", "B008R52LA2", "B002GP7ZW8", "B00GOT13FM", "B00GOT11EK", "B006LPHY6G", "B002GP7ZVY", "B0000AQS0F", "B00F6WXPSQ", "B004EXWGHY", "B000CEXFYW", "B000BW7QWW", "B001EN71CW", "B0009JE6G6", "B000JLTRHW", "B00F3L8P26", "B001KOFH2G", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B00GHH9HQ8", "B005CXOG8M", "B002GP7ZV4", "B00402FGE4", "B000PHX8RA", "1608865800", "B00GOT13M0", "B000F8O2OM", "B00061QJSK", "B001C4CI8U", "B0036EH3U2", "B0036EH3UC", "B007PZ6SYK", "B000O77SMW", "B000F8O2OW", "B000O77SN6", "B0017MO10U", "B002DUJ9Q6", "B000BCCAEQ", "B0010YSD7M", "B000F8O2Q0", "B00466H3A4", "B002EL4RLQ", "1781161682", "B001M5UDGS", "B000QUEQ4U", "B00GTZWZH6", "6303961614", "B000F8O2P6", "B00E3QJ7X8", "B004TJ1H3C", "B00AUJH32E", "B00F77MAC2", "B00IUA5FC0", "B00EAT5YCQ", "B0083SF0FG", "B00IO998U2", "B008YRL7JE", "B00471JSRE", "B0035JJJ9Q", "B004LROMWU", "B00IWTVDXO", "B00IWTVDUW", "B00HXEWECI", "B002OKWHVO", "B00FAVRHBE", "B00FF9SKSK", "B00CTSDDVO", "B009NH6AOQ", "0765327740", "B00EIXWMII", "B00DJYJWVW", "B00CDTSFF8"], "bought_together": ["B00E688720"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00E688AZE", "B0000AQS0F", "B000BW7QWW", "B00GHH9GPU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1251}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 8.49, "brand": "Vidmark/Trimark", "asin": "B0006FO9B0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YCNB24E5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars"}

{"description": "Neve Campbell is an arresting enigma inWhen Will I Be Loved, one of writer-director James Toback's most mysterious and successful minimalist dramas about sex, deception, and mutable identities in New York City. Campbell plays twentysomething beauty Vera, whose nude shower scene during the film's opening credits looks more like mythic preparation for a soon-to-be-fateful day than brazen exploitation. Ensconced in a fantastic loft paid for by her parents (Barry Primus, Karen Allen), the unemployed Vera embarks on an odyssey that begins with a mutually deceitful job interview with a college professor (Toback), leads to misadventures in questionable perception in Central Park, and climaxes with Vera's successful manipulation of two powerful men, one a craven lover (Fred Weller) and the other an Italian billionaire (Dominic Chianese) trying to get her in bed for a lot of money.

There's also a grizzled director (the great Jean-Louis Trintignant) looking to castRomeo and Juliet. Techine wrote this sexually explosive movie with Olivier Assayas (Late August, Early September), which might help explain its fluid, dreamy forward motion; nothing happens according to realistic logic, but it seems to make sense as it hurtles along.

{"description": "In addition to inspiring a college drinking game that's never gone out of style,The Bob Newhart Showgave one of America's greatest stand-up comedians a perfect sitcom showcase. This wasn't Newhart's first TV show (following the success of his comedy albums, he hosted a short-lived variety show in 1961-62), but it was the first to transfer his wry, inimitable wit to an effective alter ego, and as mild-mannered psychologist Bob Hartley, 43-year-old Newhart found a sublime character conduit for stone-faced sarcasm that was biting but never malicious.Watch our exclusive interviewwith Bob Newhart:high bandwidthorlow bandwidthLiving in a Chicago high-rise with Emily, his wife of three years and a third-grade schoolteacher (played with underrated smartness by Suzanne Pleshette), 40-year-old Bob divides his time equally between happy (but not too happy) domesticity and time at the office, where he employs a feisty and frequently lovelorn receptionist Carol (Marcia Wallace, who later enjoyed a thriving career providing voices forThe Simpsonsand other animated shows) who also works for Jerry (Peter Bonerz, who became a respected TV director), a bachelor dentist and Bob's best friend.The first season (of six, on CBS until August 1978) offered the same high quality asThe Mary Tyler Moore Show(also produced by Moore's MTM Enterprises) and established many of the memorable characters who contributed to the show's enduring greatness. Bill Daily (late ofI Dream of Jeannie) would thrive as the Hartley's divorced neighbor Howard (his uninvited \"Hi Bob!\" intrusions inspired that infamous drinking game), while married neighbor Margaret (Patricia Smith) would disappear by season's end. Among Bob's hilarious group-therapy patients, the miserable misanthrope Mr. Carlin (Jack Riley) was a comedic goldmine as the series progressed, but it's Newhart's own comic genius--including his perfected phone-call routines and deadpan reactions to everyday dilemmas--that remained the show's greatest asset. These 24 first-season episodes are remarkably consistent under the direction (mostly) of sitcom veterans Jay Sandrich and Alan Rafkin, and guest stars include Penny Marshall, Louise Lasser, Allen Garfield, Chuck McCann, and a host of other '70s TV stalwarts, all meshing nicely with one of TV's funniest ensemble casts. --Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00GHH9HW2", "B00HNGC56G", "B000A9QKSM", "B000E6ES9Y", "B00JHH1VUU", "B000G6BL7O", "B00005JLIC", "B006VC3LDO", "B00HRUQB5O", "B00096S480", "B000Z27H8Q", "B000NTMA1U", "B000G6BLDI", "B000F8O2MO", "B0002NY8R6", "B004ES6TBS", "B00GOC74QG", "B000MXPE6U", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B000BOH8YQ", "B002WN8IR0", "B00IFK7ONI", "B000MGBSH6", "B00KO72X4K", "B003VTKZ84", "B00H8KC1N4", "B00005JOXR", "B000291Q3O", "B0006N2EZA", "B00KYCA4QY", "B00005JOEB", "B0006N2EZK", "B00GOC74I4", "B0006TPE1U", "B000M343AS", "B000BGR1B4", "B000068V9X", "B00008EY6N", "B002PQ7JR4", "B000EXDS02", "B000A0GOP0", "B000FTC1GW", "B00096S45S", "B001OXLGK0", "B000LXGXY8", "B0030U1TCK", "B0002NY8PI", "B000FSMEB0", "B0011N19HI", "B0025KVNOU", "B00009VRF0", "B001Q9E9KG", "B00D2UMHB0", "B0001NBNJ8", "B001NPK5BU", "B000A0GOQ4", "B00E96AWY0", "B00GLT2SOA", "B00IFK7OFG", "B0000V4906", "B003RHZ6CK", "B00005JMHI", "B0000BV1XX", "B00JDCP0QA", "B002E58FT2", "B000N2HD6O", "B00BHWG0N6", "B001JFKWE4", "B000T22PVG", "B005DCJ0Q0", "B000EQ5PTQ", "B000EXZFS0", "B000YGGNGK", "B000E3L7EQ", "B000BF0C8E", "B0007WFY4S", "B0002W4SWW", "B0001DMXEC", "B0085Z6ZD8", "B00HW3LG3S", "B00008EYBH", "B0012EM5E2", "B0012EM5DS", "B000CCBCCG", "B0001Z3I1C", "B00I458456", "B002XKKX8E", "B001O4KBNM", "B0002NY81C", "B00008NV4G", "B0007OCG74", "B0085Z6YYI", "B00A2XQTF0", "B00FM4S7P4", "B0011FLGYM", "B002ACKBTG", "B001D5C1EY", "B00KTFJ7UA", "B0089BSLKS", "B00DICPAMU"], "bought_together": ["B00GHH9HW2", "B00HNGC56G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00GHH9HW2", "B00HNGC56G", "B00HRUQB5O", "B00JHH1VUU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23588}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 17.97, "brand": "NEWHART,BOB", "asin": "B0007IO6PA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JFG6YMC7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Bob Newhart Show - The Complete First Season"}
{"description": "Two young sisters recovering from an unnamed trauma must face a mysterious past in this excellent South Korean shocker. A worldwide hit upon its release and based on an old Korean fairy tale; two sisters (wonderfully played by Su-jeong Lim and Geun-yeong Mun) come to live with their cold and distant father and turn-on-a-dime stepmother in a house where nothing is as it seems.   A wonderfully haunting score, starkly beautiful imagery, and a labyrinthine plot that twists and turns at every dark corner all set the stage for a riveting and often terrifying guessing game of a movie.

With the 2005 series, however, the BBC have really outdone themselves. Their updated Doctor Who is a revelation: a cult science fiction series that has real mass appeal, and works for both children and their parents. Christopher Eccleston is an inspired and charismatic Doctor--he leaps around the sets with an unrestrained glee, like he's a child running amok in a toy shop. His enthusiasm in downright infectious. His sidekick Rose (Billie Piper) adds a real human touch, particularly as she gradually and believably matures from in-over-her-head city kid to tough-minded interplanetary hero. Much of the credit must go to writer Russell Davies, who has a much-practiced knack for finding popular appeal without dumbing-down his ideas, and who appears to have let his imagination run riot. Even the special effects, whilst not of a big-budget cinematic quality, still manage to strike a balance between cheesiness and realism. Thrilling, funny and thoroughly entertaining, this Doctor Who is a hero for the new millennium. --Robert Burrow", "related": {"also_bought": ["B008KHIKWK", "B00ANDR1HO", "B00ANDDBBE", "B00K6DEQ92", "B00B1LKXZ4", "B008KHRODG", "B005M2A4D4", "B000UVV2GA", "B00C6ACVD6", "B005M2A4DE", "B00IYJHAWK", "B003EV6DBW", "B00FAVRFXE", "B00HVBB16I", "B002ZHKZEC", "B00HCK7THS", "B00J9BP9YS", "B004FUYSV8", "B00CENXWA6", "B00C6ACVLI", "B006MVKMTU", "B004QOB8R0", "B00BXTH49M", "B00FAVRHBE", "B004QOB8QG", "B00J3QG6Y6", "B002DYKBZA", "B0094GSRYW", "B0050UEVJ6", "B00HCK7ZMM", "B002ZHKZDS", "B00ANDGYRM", "B0049S1NYG", "B000VWE5OY", "B00CENWUZE", "B002BSH9L2", "B00K6DIZM6", "B002BVYBJW", "B0013GS3WW", "B002ZHKZFG", "B007AFS118", "B001AGXEBK", "B00E3UN44W", "B0009PVZFK", "B0017XOFGE", "B000KGGIRI", "B00C6QXFIU", "B005SH65GI", "B00DNQKF2G", "B008FTX6PO", "B000067FPC", "B001K2KM9Q", "B004QOB8SO", "B00KYNR1HI", "B00272NJ7K", "B007AAEZY0", "B000B7QCJ0", "B000GRUQM4", "B001QCWQ62", "B004132HZS", "B0002OXVF0", "B00114XLZK", "B000NJXG8G", "B002PHVHK8", "B005SH63H4", "B001QCWQ5S", "B0050UEVFU", "B00EZQH11G", "B00IT3KQMC", "B000Z7G87W", "B001Q9ECNA", "B001C71IGA", "B002N1AEX2", "B00272NJ66", "B001QCWQ58", "B00KB614HQ", "B008RO876U", "B00GTZWZH6", "B005SH62X4", "B005SH63I8", "0563486481", "B0007TKH66", "B0002F6BSS", "1465402675", "B005SH664E", "B00C6ACUF0", "B00IO998U2", "B001Q9ECM6", "B00K1EKVD6", "B00BHBO3LI", "B0007VY47C", "B00BD6K54G", "B00BXTFDK4", "B001AGXEBU", "B007P4Y7Y4", "B005NHZBAO", "B007FQXESM", "B0013XZ6T8", "B004FUYSUO", "B000Z7G87C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00C6ACVD6", "B00FAVRFXE", "B00HCK7THS", "B00DYAE2IY"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 341146}, "asin": "B0009AK57Y", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z%2BSUiwxgL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Doctor Who - The Complete First Series [Region 2]"}

With jaw-dropping fight sequences by Yuen Wo Ping (famed action choreographer of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and The Matrix), KUNG FU HUSTLE will blow you away!

{"description": "A sitcom behemoth of the last 10 years,Friendsshot out of the gate in 1994 with snappy writing and an attractive cast. The exploits of sensitive paleontologist Ross Geller (David Schwimmer), his obsessive-compulsive sister Monica Geller (Courteney Cox); Monica's roommate Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston), a spoiled rich girl trying to live on her own; earthy aromatherapist/masseuse Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow); and Monica's neighbors across the hall-- sarcastic Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry) and his dim-bulb roommate Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc) became a nationwide obsession, a pop-culture icon (remember \"The Rachel\" haircut?)  and a top Nielsen hit for its entire run.See the10 or more seasons club.The first two seasons were mostly centered on the on-off saga of Ross and Rachel, and while their relationship remained a strong presence through romantic rivals and even a baby,View clips andvote for your favoriteFriendsmoment.the other characters eventually moved from sideshow players into a shared comedic lead. ButFriendswas not without its heart. Most of the cast had dysfunctional relationships with their parents and went through loss, divorce, marriage, parenthood, and love triangles. The emotional pregnancies of Rachel (by Ross) and Phoebe (surrogate to her half-brother's triplets) won the actresses Emmy Awards, and Joey's tender feelings for Rachel in Season 8 won LeBlanc, the most improved actor in the series, a nomination.Most sitcoms run out of ideas by the fifth season, butFriendsgave itself a refreshing jolt the minute Monica and Chandler wound up in bed together. Their budding romance was not only the one of the funniest arcs of the series, but one of the most sentimental, as they planned a wedding, struggled to have a child and eventually turned to adoption. By seasons seven and on, the characters had each \"grown up\" from young singletons to thirtysomethings finding permanence in their careers and love lives but never losing the laughs.Just friends? See our guide towho kissed whomonFriends.Friendsfeatured a parade of celebrity guests, but unlikeWill & Grace, it actually utilized most of the stars as more than cameos: The sextet's parents were all brilliantly cast, particularly Kathleen Turner as Chandler's drag-queen father and Teri Garr as Phoebe's dizzy mom. Everyone from George Clooney to Sean Penn to Julia Roberts to Bruce Willis has appeared on the sitcom, and Tom Selleck certainly enjoyed a career resuscitation after his recurring role as Monica's older man.But no star power ever penetrated the bond between the six stars, and their unmatchable chemistry worked for 10 seasons. Even if the show is on reruns daily, this boxed set ofFriendsremains watchable over and over again--even if that theme song grates on your nerves.Standout episodes include The One With All The Poker (Season 1), The One With The Birth (1), The One With the Prom Video (2), The One With the Flashback (3), The One Where Monica and Richard are Just Friends (3), The One Where Ross and Rachel Take a Break (3), The One With the Embryos (4), The One With All the Wedding Dresses (4), The One With the Thanksgiving Flashbacks (5), The One Where Everybody Finds Out (5), The One Where Ross Got High (6), The One With the Videotape (8), The One With the Rumor (8), The One With the Male Nanny (9), The One With Rachel's Other Sister (9), The One With Ross' Tan (10), and The One Where the Stripper Cries (10).--Ellen A.

{"description": "The Adventures of Spin and Martypremiered onThe Mickey Mouse Clubin 1955 and scored an instant hit. Like many of Disney's most successful creations,Spin and Martywas a simple story. Rich, coddled Martin Markham (David Stollery) arrives at the Triple R in his grandmother's limousine and dismisses the dude ranch for boys as \"a dirty old farm.\" His comment angers everyone, especially Spin Evans (Tim Considine), the most popular boy on the ranch. Over the course of the summer, Marty learns to relax and make friends; he and Spin become best buddies. Humor and wisdom are dispensed by wrangler Ollie (Leonard P. Greer), \"Well I'll be a blue-nosed gopher!\"; Marty's fussy butler, Perkins (J. Pat O'Malley); avuncular foreman Bill Burnett (Harry Carey, Jr.); and George (Sammee Tong), the Chinese cook, who regales the boys with Western songs in Cantonese. The characters proved so popular Disney brought them back inThe Further Adventures of Spin and Marty(1957) andThe New Adventures of Spin and Marty(1957).For Baby Boomers,Spin and Martypacks the kind of nostalgic wallop the \"Andy Hardy\" movies andThe Wizard of Ozhad for earlier generations. During the '50s, millions of kids dreamed of spending the summer at the Triple R. InMore Tales of the City, Armistead Maupin suggests that whether you identify with Spin or Marty constitutes a key division in American society, comparable to who your favorite Beatle was. In the extras, a dismayingly old Considine and Stollery revisit the ranch in Newhall, CA, where the series was filmed. This set is a sure-fire gift choice for aging Boomers.

{"description": "Disney Raritieslives up to its title: It's been impossible to see many of these shorts for decades. Walt Disney bankrupted his fledgling Laugh-O-Gram studio making \"Alice's Wonderland,\" but the short earned Disney his first national distribution contract. Films featuring animated characters in live-action settings were common during the silent era; Disney reversed the situation, placing a live actress (Virginia Davis) in a cartoon world. The \"Alice\" series ran from 1923-1926, and several girls played the title role. These silent films have been handsomely restored and given upbeat musical tracks by Alex Rannie.The Oscar-winners \"Ferdinand the Bull\" (1938) and \"Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom\" (1953) rank as genuine classics, and have been unavailable for far too long. The wartime cautionary tale \"Chicken Little\" (1943) displays more imagination than the 2005 feature adaptation of the same story. \"The Truth About Mother Goose\" (1957) reflects the influence ofSleeping Beauty(1959), which was in production then; the elephants in \"Goliath II\" (1960) anticipate the ones inThe Jungle Book(1967).\"Noah's Ark\" (1959), Disney's first stop-motion film, features cleverly designed animals made from pencils, erasers, corks, pipecleaners, and other found objects, but the obstrusive '50s songs quickly cloy. Many of the films from the '50s and early '60s (\"Pigs Is Pigs,\" \"A Cowboy Needs a Horse,\" \"Paul Bunyan\" ) reflect the look of the UPA Studio. The characters are flatter, simpler, and more angular; the backgrounds, more stylized. Although Disney had dominated the cartoon short during the '30s, the studio largely shifted to feature and television production during the '40s and '50s.Disney Raritiesis a set fans and students of animation will want to own.

{"description": "Fantasy Adventure. Acclaimed director Tim Burton brings his vividly imaginative style to the beloved Roald Dahl classic Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, about eccentric chocolatier Willy Wonka (Depp) and Charlie, a good-hearted boy from a poor family who lives in the shadow of Wonka's extraordinary factory.

{"description": "With Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson as a pair of brazen wedding crashers, this buddy/romantic comedy milks a few big laughs from its foolproof premise. Under the direction of David Dobkin (who previously worked with Wilson onShanghai Knights), the movie ranges from bawdy romp to mushy romance, and that tonal identity crisis curtails the overall hilarity. But when the well-teamed costars are firing on all pistons with fast-paced dialogue and manic situations, belly laughs are delivered at a steady clip. Things get complicated when the guys infiltrate the family of the Treasury Secretary (Christopher Walken), resulting in a romantic pair-off between Vaughn and the congressman's oversexed daughter Gloria (Isla Fisher) while Wilson sincerely woos another daughter, Claire (Rachel McAdams), who's unhappily engaged to an Ivy League cheater (Bradley Cooper). Walken is more or less wasted in his role, but Jane Seymour and Henry Gibson make amusing appearances, and a surprise guest arrives late in the game for some over-the-top scene-stealing. It's all a bit uneven, but McAdams (considered by some to be \"the next Julia Roberts\") is a pure delight, and with enough laughs to make it easily recommended,Wedding Crasherswill likely find its place on DVD shelves alongside other flawed but enjoyable R-rated comedies that embrace a naughtier, nastier brand of humor with no need for apologies.--Jeff ShannonVince Vaughn's MoviesWhy We Love Rachel McAdamsOwen Wilson's MoviesThe SoundtrackThe Return of Crass ComedyThe 40-Year-Old Virgin", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFYS2M", "B000ELJAEM", "B00466HN7M", "B008R65XNS", "B00005JNZU", "B00006FMUW", "B000J4P9P8", "B002ZGW92E", "B001G5T6GW", "B000WZEZGI", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B00003CXSM", "B001TUZD8O", "B000HCPS94", "B001C0JCBA", "B0009HBPN0", "B001OD4S50", "B00005JMYI", "B00005JG6N", "B004EPZ084", "B0015I2RT8", "B00AEFYAMA", "B00AEBB8NS", "B00AEFXJS6", "B000069CF0", "B000TZJBPQ", "B00003CXO1", "B001C5LLQ4", "B0009OL7Z4", "B0007RT9M6", "B00005JMW7", "B001J9KJ4I", "B0006GANPA", "B003Y5H574", "B000BKJ762", "B000E6EHE0", "B003Y5H524", "B000ICM5X0", "B00AEFY7I2", "B002K0WBXW", "B00AEBB9K0", "B000VXWX7E", "B0013D8LHC", "B004HO6I2E", "B001DPHDB0", "B0016MOV92", "B00AEFYM2S", "B004EPZ070", "B000JJ4DNW", "B003CRM6PA", "B00BEIYMZ6", "B008R65XMO", "B00005JMX6", "B00AEBBA2C", "B004EPZ06G", "B004EPYZS0", "B003Y5H5B0", "B00024JC4E", "B0000AKCKI", "B000957O82", "B00AEFYQE2", "B00DV2MVWO", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B001L9EXTS", "B0041KKYGU", "B00AEFZ3XU", "B002U4UYZA", "B000CPH9PM", "B000EMGJAO", "B000M341QE", "B008R65XUQ", "B00005JMCT", "B001AKTZW8", "B00008WJD6", "B00AEFYSL8", "B002P413IC", "B00AEFXVW0", "B002ZG99H2", "B0000A02TZ", "B005LAII12", "B001SN78JO", "B008JFUORW", "B000LC3ICE", "B002T9H2LA", "B0051MKNRC", "B003HKN52U", "B000CCBCAS", "B00AEFYZCU", "B002ZG980U", "B00AEFY99O", "B002VWNIEA", "B0000524E5", "B004AV5GX6", "B000A343RI", "B000EMGJ7C", "B004LWZW5G", "B00AEFXDO6", "B00000K3UU", "B004SIP95G", "B0009RCPUW"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFYS2M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00466HN7M", "B001G5T6GW", "B003Y5H5B0", "B000J4P9P8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 92528}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.95, "brand": "New Line Home Video", "asin": "B000BKVQRU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z2E7093FL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wedding Crashers (R-Rated Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "On the surface, David Cronenberg may seem an unlikely candidate to directA History of Violence, but dig deeper and you'll see that he's the right man for the job. As an intellectual seeker of meaning and an avowed believer in Darwinian survival of the fittest, Cronenberg knows that the story of mild-mannered small-town diner proprietor Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) is in fact a multilayered examination of inbred human behavior, beginning when Tom's skillful killing of two would-be robbers draws unwanted attention to his idyllic family life in rural Indiana. He's got a loving wife (Maria Bello) and young daughter (Heidi Hayes) who are about to learn things about Tom they hadn't suspected, and a teenage son (Ashton Holmes) who has inherited his father's most prominent survival trait, manifesting itself in ways he never expected. By the time Tom has come into contact with a scarred villain (Ed Harris) and connections that lead him to a half-crazy kingpin (William Hurt, in a spectacular cameo), Cronenberg has plumbed the dark depths of human nature so skillfully thatA History of Violencestands well above the graphic novel that inspired it (indeed, Cronenberg was unaware of the source material behind Josh Olson's chilling adaptation). With hard-hitting violence that's as sudden as it is graphically authentic, this isA History of Violencethat's worthy of serious study and widespread acclaim.--Jeff ShannonOn the DVDOn a single disc and with little fanfare, this DVD makes an excellent case for the best extras of the year. Dive into the one-hour-long documentary and learn more about moviemaking than on many a double-disc. The secret lies in director David Cronenberg's (and his usual crew) folksy casualness in showing off the craft, be it makeup (green screens were used), directing (Cronenberg doesn't storyboard), or art direction (the diner set). It also is very funny to hear about \"fish Fridays\" and how Maria Bello's Uncle Pete became an influence. Even the infamous sex-on-the-staircase scene is diagnosed with candor as stars Viggo Mortensen and Bello act as if there is no backstage camera. There's only one deleted scene, but it's uncommonly deconstructed on why it was filmed and why it was cut (it's a very Cronenbergian dream sequence). A short bit on Cannes is also a delight.

{"description": "The latest entry in theHarry Pottersaga could be retitledFast Times at Hogwarts, where finding a date to the winter ball is nearly as terrifying as worrying about Lord Voldemort's return. Thus, the young wizards' entry into puberty (and discovery of the opposite sex) opens up a rich mining field to balance out the dark content in the fourth movie (and the stories are only going to get darker). Mike Newell (Four Weddings and a Funeral) handily takes the directing reins and eases his young cast through awkward growth spurts into true young actors. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe, more sure of himself) has his first girl crush on fellow student Cho Chang (Katie Leung), and has his first big fight with best bud Ron (Rupert Grint). Meanwhile, Ron's underlying romantic tension with Hermione (Emma Watson) comes to a head over the winter ball, and when she makes one of those girl-into-woman Cinderella entrances, the boys' reactions indicate they've all crossed a threshold.But don't worry, there's plenty of wizardry and action inGoblet of Fire. When the deadly Triwizard Tournament is hosted by Hogwarts, Harry finds his name mysteriously submitted (and chosen) to compete against wizards from two neighboring academies, as well as another Hogwarts student. The competition scenes are magnificently shot, with much-improved CGI effects (particularly the underwater challenge). And the climactic confrontation with Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes, in a brilliant bit of casting) is the most thrilling yet.Goblet, the first installment to get a PG-13 rating, contains some violence as well as disturbing images for kids and some barely shrouded references at sexual awakening (Harry's bath scene in particular). The 2 1/2-hour film, lean considering it came from a 734-page book, trims out subplots about house-elves (they're not missed) and gives little screen time to the standard crew of the otherPotterfilms, but adds in more of Britain's finest actors to the cast, such as Brendan Gleeson as Mad-Eye Moody and Miranda Richardson as Rita Skeeter. Michael Gambon, in his second round as Professor Dumbledore, still hasn't brought audiences around to his interpretation of the role he took over after Richard Harris died, but it's a small smudge in an otherwise spotless adaptation.--Ellen A.

{"description": "Deep Blueis a compelling BBC documentary that introduces viewers to some of earth's most mysterious ocean creatures.  Three years in the filming, the breathtaking cinematography ofDeep Blue(all of which originally appeared in the BBC seriesThe Blue Planet - Seas of Life), combined with an excellent musical score and the sparse narration of Pierce Brosnan, is both awe inspiring and moving.  Intimate and unique footage of sea life includes an innovative under-the-ice view of penguins propelling themselves out of the water as captured by a newly invented pole camera.  Cutting-edge submarine technology allows the exploration of the deepest reaches of the sea where alien looking, jelly-like creatures flourish in a world of immense pressure and constant darkness.  Perhaps the most peculiar setting is the Marianas Trench where deep mid-ocean ridges regularly erupt and spew hot water and poisonous gasses into the water while sea life inexplicably flourishes on the underwater chimneys.  Rare footage of a polar bear hunting beluga whales and orca whales ravaging a sea lion and attacking a gray whale cub is graphic and disturbing, but lends a sense of a eons-old natural hierarchy.  While the scarcity of narration in the main film sometimes leaves the viewer hungry for information, the 50-minute \"making of\" feature is packed with logistical and technical details.  The segment also conveys the entire crew's firm commitment to creating a complete ocean portrait with the goal of engaging people with the creatures of the ocean.

{"description": "TV Westerns once ruled the primetime range, inspiring Jonathan Winters to joke at the time, \"I like Westerns, I just don't like 15 of them in a row.\"The Big Valleycame along near the end of the trail. Premiering in 1965, it ran for four seasons and earned an Emmy for \"Miss Barbara Stanwyck,\" who stars as widowed matriarch Victoria Barkley. Her brood is a breed apart: Jarrod (Richard Long), the eldest son, who returns to the sprawling Barkley home in the San Joaquin Valley to practice law; excitable Nick (Peter Breck), who is in charge of the family enterprises, youngest son Eugene (Charles Briles), an inconsequential character who would ride off into the sunset by season two; and \"shameful\" and \"spoiled\" daughter Audra (Linda Evans), who, in the first episode, is a real kitten with a whip. As a family saga,The Big Valleyis moreBonanzathanDallaswith one groundbreaking, soap opera twist: the arrival of Heath (Lee Majors), the self-proclaimed \"bastard son\" of deceased community pillar Tom Barkley. This first season's most compelling dramatic arc is Heath's struggle to be accepted by his brothers (particularly the hot-headed Nick) and determination to stake his claim to \"a name, heritage... what's mine.\"The Big Valleyrounded up a stable of great character actors, several at the beginnings of their careers. The episode \"By Force and Violence\" alone offers Bruce Dern as an escaped convict whom Victoria compels at gunpoint to help rescue Heath, who is trapped under a disabled wagon, and L.Q. Jones and Harry (Dean) Stanton as the bounty hunters on his trail. Several of the episodes cover some of the same ground: an old family friend is revealed to be less than trustworthy; Audra falls for the wrong guy; someone's got a grudge against the Barkleys. One of the season's most memorable episodes is a tale of redemption, \"The Guilt of Matt Bentell,\" in which the man the Barkleys have hired to oversee their logging operations is the former warden of an apparently Abu Ghraib-like Civil War prison where Heath was incarcerated.

{"description": "Made for Showtime, theMasters of Horrorseries features films by renowned horror film directors, such asHomecomingby Joe Dante (The Howling,Gremlins). This satire about Bush's War On Terrorism is a one-liner, in which soldiers killed in Iraq rise from the dead to vote the president out of office as their last effort to end the war. Zombies fight for peace as the politicians concoct deadly schemes in this comedic film about the idiocy of our current government. Political consultants Jane Cleaver (Thea Gill) and David Murch (Jon Tenney) meet during a talk show panel, then watch in horror as the news begins to air footage of soldier zombies wandering the streets towards their local voting booths. Top political officials, unable to slay the undead, discover that the zombies die on their own after dropping their voting cards into the boxes. Zombies spark a small revolution by denouncing WMDs on television, urging citizens to follow suit. Though weak compared to Romero's great sarcastic zombie film,Dawn of the Dead,Homecomingfeatures enough body parts squirting green blood to entertain. Over-the-top humor throughout recallsRe-Animator, yet the political message goes deeper.

{"description": "Blink while watchingDallas: The Complete Fifth Season, and one might miss some of the fastest moving nastiness ever seen on the granddaddy of primetime soaps. Hovering over everything is the tragic loss of grizzled patriarch Jock Ewing (Jim Davis, who died prior to season 5), off on business in South America but dead before he returns to Southfork Ranch and the arms of Miss Ellie (Barbara Bel Geddes). While the widow grieves for her loss, charming scoundrel J.R. (Larry Hagman) finds new lows to reach as he conspires to woo estranged wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) back to Southfork and blackmail younger brother Bobby (Patrick Duffy) into abandoning his shares in Ewing Oil, thus giving J.R. control. Even J.R.'s schemes mask deeper ploys: getting back Sue Ellen means getting back their toddler son, John Ross, which means adding John Ross's ten shares to J.R.'s arsenal. Sheesh.There's also more collateral damage than ever from J.R.'s machinations, notably the complete destruction of chronic loser Cliff Barnes (Ken Kercheval), whose romantic overtures toward Sue Ellen stand in J.R.'s way. Not only does poor Cliff lose Sue Ellen's affections, he falls hook, line, and sinker for a fake deal dangled by a J.R. confederate, costing him the respect and support of his family and threatening his health. But there's also the infant son of Sue Ellen's late sister to think about: Bobby and baby-starved Pam (Victoria Principal) want to adopt him, but J.R. claims to be the father and threatens to take the boy away. (How do most of these people manage to live under the same Southfork roof?) Meanwhile, young Lucy (Charlene Tilton) deals with divorce and the emotional aftermath of being held hostage, and Jock's son Ray (Steve Kanaly) threatens his marital stability with impulsive investments in real estate. Everything comes to a head with a new eruption in the old Ewing-Barnes family feud, and an internal fight for control of the Ewing empire. Down and dirty, and completely irresistible. A nice special feature provides a tour of the real-life Southfork ranch.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000JLTRFE", "B000BVM1TG", "B000PAAK0A", "B0009IW894", "B000YGGNIS", "B0016I0AGY", "B001C9S0F0", "B001JAHPWQ", "B001JAHPX0", "B00028G7LG", "B001JAHPXA", "B001JAHPXK", "B004H83IHI", "B00E7XS4EA", "B009GYS70Q", "B000CS45AG", "B000PGUT8C", "B00CD45J5W", "B0015I2S7E", "B001BN4WLS", "B004X1M47O", "B004X1M3DE", "B002VJ05EE", "B00005JOA4", "B001QU9RRK", "1581824726", "B007R915RE", "B00H5NY6F0", "B0002Y4T7O", "B0007IO6V4", "B002VJ05EO", "B00450S800", "B000QUEQ68", "B00AQ6ROHK", "B00274SIVA", "B008IG0F7G", "B0045HCJJ4", "B005DGKBDC", "B003BGZ61S", "B0007WQHFS", "B0007WFY4S", "B0007WFXL2", "B001NRPQKI", "B001SMC9IU", "B001VB8UCW", "B00D4ABT8K", "B002XKKX8E", "B001D2WUDE", "B0007TKNDS", "B001LRL4WY", "B0077PTWX2", "B00GOC75V0", "B00K8HALVI", "B007V4ETS2", "B000O77SNG", "B009AYNOYQ", "B0007R4SWC", "B0001O3YHQ", "B000FA57U8", "B004D2GMVM", "B00005JNIS", "B000092T3Y", "B000C6NPHC", "B003F9LS90", "B00003CXOP", "B00EFYAZAM", "B001UHOWYM", "B000ASDFIG", "B009A9EMYM", "B000BB1MJ6", "B001GLFPWK", "B008OR5X6M", "B002O3Z4WK", "B00JEZWRE4", "B00CVB6XDO", "B00008PW1F", "B00AA8Q0JM", "B008H6GHII", "B00BUWD7E8", "B000068V9X", "B00GLPYVQC", "B002VWNIBI", "B000FOPPBA", "B000BF0C7A", "B000XJD3JS", "B000DZ95IU", "B00DXLO0D6", "B0009UC80Q", "B00EAPC860", "B00GLT2TR6", "B000FUH38C", "B00IN69P0E", "B00HW3LG3S", "B00EIXWW2O", "B000EXDSCA", "B00CWIMVDW", "B000E5KQMI", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B00DII0MGI", "B001VPJYZK"], "bought_together": ["B000JLTRFE", "B000BVM1TG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BVM1TG", "B0009IW894", "B000JLTRFE", "B00028G7LG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22415}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 17.69, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000FI9OD6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P5AQPWQBL._SX300_.jpg", "title": "Dallas: Season 5"}

{"description": "Even devoted fans can&#x92;t deny thatRiptidewas grade-A cheese--and we're talking Velveeta, not Gruy&#xE8;re That said, a little TV-style cheese never hurt anyone. In the first episode, Cody (Perry King,Class of 1984) notes that he and fellow ex-Army MP Nick (Joe Penny,Jake and the Fatman) have been friends for 10 years, detectives for two weeks. Of course, an action-adventure series needs sidekicks and gimmicks. So, computer genius and fellow vet Murray \"Boz\" Bozinsky (Thom Bray) becomes the brains to their brawn, while toys include a houseboat (\"The Riptide\"), a pink helicopter (\"The Screaming Mimi\"), and a robot (\"Roboz\"). As withMiami Vice, which premiered the same year, much of the action takes place by the water, while the playful banter between the Southern California-based duo is reminiscent ofSimon & Simon, one of the era's other popular buddy shows Created by Stephen J. Cannell (Hunter,21 Jump Street),Riptidealso gave the gals something to ogle--in the two-part pilot (\"Riptide, AKA Pier 56\"), King and Penny play an entire scene wearing nothing but tighty-whiteys. And in most episodes, shirts are sure to come off. Courtesy of the scenic location, the series boasts a bevy of bikini-clad babes, as well.Guests stars include Kelly Preston (\"The Hard Case\"), Dennis Franz (\"Double Your Pleasure\"), and Geena Davis and Lance Henriksen (\"Raiders of the Lost Sub\"). Marsha Warfield (Night Court) and Anne Francis (Honey West) also drop by on occasion. The former is Max, hostess at their favorite nightspot; the latter is Mama Jo, skipper of the all-female charter craft docked in the next slip.Riptidebegan life on NBC as a midseason replacement, paired with Cannell&#x92;sThe A-Team, and was renewed for two more seasons. Entertaining adventures aside, this three-disc set is devoid of extras.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Filter aTwilight Zonevibe through Stephen King's brain and you getNightmares & Dreamscapes, an uneven but generally entertaining collection of eight tales that originally (2006) aired on TNT. There is no unifying theme here; although King's short stories provided the source material, there are six directors and seven screenwriters represented, so the episodes offer a variety of looks and styles, with content ranging from monsters to mind games, from pure fantasy to pulp fiction, from genuinely scary to merely unsettling. Still, a certain ineffably \"King-ian\" sensibility, combining elements of horror, terror, suspense, and whimsy, is always in evidence, as are the popular writer's own preoccupations (with authors who may or not be stand-ins for King himself, rock 'n' roll, and guys who won't ask for directions while their wives complain, inevitably leading them into very nasty situations).Among the highlights: In \"Battleground,\" a merciless hit man (William Hurt) offs a toy manufacturer and then finds himself attacked in his own apartment by a battalion of indefatigable toy soldiers; directed by Brian Henson, the episode has no dialogue and some terrific effects work. In \"Umney's Last Case,\" William H. Macy is amusing as a crime writer who cruelly toys with his literary alter ego, an arch, fedora-wearing gumshoe (also Macy); it's an actingtour de forceand a story that takes some deft and intriguing turns. \"The Road Virus Heads North,\" with Tom Berenger as a horror novelist who finds himself pursued by&#x85; well, by a painting (guess you had to be there), is perhaps the scariest of the lot; it's also the best shot, with a cool jazz soundtrack and a nifty ending. Less successful is \"Crouch End,\" set in a sinister part of London where \"thin spots\" in the earth lead to creepy new dimensions (nice premise, but it's overwritten and fails to sustain itsTwilight Zoneweirdness), while \"You Know They Got a Hell of Band\" is only fitfully effective in its depiction of Rock & Roll Heaven, Oregon, a town where Elvis is mayor and the rest of the living dead range from Hendrix and Joplin to Duane Allman and Buddy Holly. The three-disc set's decent if unexceptional special features include \"inside looks\" at the making of several episodes, actor interviews, and more.--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B006J8NPAE", "B000G1R39E", "B000U1ZV6W", "B00000F3SB", "B0000C2IQQ", "B00009OWI3", "B000063US5", "1573625779", "B002EP8FDI", "B008QE9Z8A", "B000053UIF", "B00BW4S8AC", "B00005UQ9V", "B0002OXVG4", "B000RIWAV2", "B00AEBB91E", "B00BW4S87U", "B00APQLJTA", "0792841328", "B0010X73ZG", "B00006FDCD", "B0007WFXNA", "B000H4JH7Q", "6305645574", "B0001FVDQ4", "B0002O7XW2", "B000077VRT", "B000TJ6PBK", "B00AEBB91O", "B002NZK5SM", "B000RZIGUE", "B003L2M584", "0767821599", "B00005LQ0Q", "B0007NFMB2", "B000068IES", "B00BW4S89S", "B00AEFYV9W", "B000GBEWRU", "B00005O439", "B0084MVE7E", "B0007CEXUY", "630523650X", "6305120021", "B00AEFXR8I", "0790742829", "B00BTYPW7C", "1573626910", "1439102562", "B00006FDCU", "B00A1AU72A", "B003VJTGNE", "B0033HKCV4", "B0053TWVDC", "B0053TWV46", "6304936397", "0792846443", "B00KW3A6KE", "B00C2CDJ34", "B000069I05", "B0024FADBA", "B002GHHHG0", "B000WC384Q", "B00005JOJE", "B00DII0MGI", "B002AS45VK", "B00005K3NR", "B0002J4ZX2", "B0004Z31OS", "B000SULWKO", "1476770387", "B008HSK3PE", "B002VWNIDG", "6304604572", "B001KKU9CI", "B003JIPN20", "0786890436", "B000UVV22O", "B000UYX4PO", "B00IYJRIKO", "B00C7T0EPS", "B000E5N6B6", "1476754454", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AKGG828", "B000FFJZO2", "B0002A2VK0", "B0002S94BQ", "B006BZ8NSE", "B000F3UAE8", "B0077PTWLO", "B0001907BC", "B006ZL1P66", "0783116926", "B00AN10NU8", "B002BE7JEI", "B005CFBZVG", "0670813028", "B000P0J0BU"], "bought_together": ["B006J8NPAE", "B000G1R39E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00006FDCD", "B000063US5", "B00BW4S8AC", "B00AEBB91E"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14405}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 8.13, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000GYI340", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41697YkAkVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes - From the Stories of Stephen King"}

{"description": "Accept no substitutes. The 1966 television adaptation of Dr. Seuss' timeless bookHow the Grinch Stole Christmas!--about an anti-Santa who tries to heist the holiday only to learn a powerful lesson--is a classic in its own right, and looking better than ever in its 50th Birthday Deluxe Edition. (For those doing the math, the 50 years is counting from the book's 1957 publishing date rather than the show's broadcast date.) The most significant improvement is in the digital transfer, cleaning up fuzz and specks and restoring the proper colors to the program. While the awful earlier DVDs showed the Grinch in a mustard-yellow color, this edition restores his proper green gleam.  Special features are mostly ported over from the previous DVD--theHorton Hears a Whoprogram, a featurette on the songs, Phil Hartman's special edition version, pencil tests, etc. minus the commentary track--but there is a new 15-minute featurette, \"Dr. Seuss and the Grinch: From Whoville to Hollywood.\" While it starts out as a fluff piece aimed at the younger set (interviews with kids, some rapping), it does provide some interesting information, including interviews with the widows of Theodore Geisel and Chuck Jones and clips of Geisel and Jones'Private Snafu.

{"description": "Joyeux Noelcaptures a rare moment of grace from one of the worst wars in the history of mankind, World War I. On Christmas Eve, 1914, as German, French, and Scottish regiments face each other from their respective trenches, a musical call-and-response turns into an impromptu cease-fire, trading chocolates and champagne, playing soccer, and comparing pictures of their wives. But when Christmas ends, the war returns...Joyeux Noelhas been justly accused of sentimentality, but if any subject warrants such an earnest and hopeful treatment, it's the horrors of trench warfare. The largely unknown cast--the more familiar faces include Diane Kruger (Troy), Daniel Bruhl (Good Bye Lenin!), Benno Furmann (The Princess and the Warrior), and Gary Lewis (Billy Elliot)--deliver low-key but effective performances as the movie dwells on the everyday elements of life in the face of war.

{"description": "This clever, funny big-screen adaptation of Lauren Weisberger's best-seller takes some of the snarky bite out of the chick lit book, but smoothes out the characters' boxy edges to make a more satisfying movie. There's no doubtThe Devil Wears Prada belongs to Meryl Streep, who turns in an Oscar&#65533;-worthy (seriously!) strut as the monster editor-in-chief ofRunway, an elite fashion magazine full of size-0, impossibly well-dressed plebes. This makes new second-assistant Andrea (Anne Hathaway), who's smart but an unacceptable size 6, stick out like a sore thumb. Streep has a ball sending her new slave on any whimsical errand, whether it's finding the seventh (unpublished) Harry Potter book or knowing what type she means when she wants \"skirts.\" Though Andrea thumbs her nose at the shallow world of fashion (she's only doing the job to open doors to a position atThe New Yorker someday), she finds herself dually disgusted yet seduced by the perks of the fast life. The film sends a basic message: Make work your priority, and you'll be rich and powerful... and lonely. Any other actress would have turned Miranda into a scenery-chewing Cruella, but Streep's underplayed, brilliant comic timing make her a fascinating, unapologetic character. Adding frills to the movie's fun are Stanley Tucci as Streep's second-in-command, Emily Blunt (My Summer of Love) as the overworked first assistant, Simon Baker as a sexy writer, and breathtaking couture designs any reader ofVogue would salivate over. --Ellen A.

{"description": "The fourth season ofBaywatchmarks the first appearance of another of the series' iconic, er, figures: Yasmine Bleeth, whose Caroline Holden character (the sister of Alexandra Paul's Stephanie Holden character) became one ofBaywatch's most famous babes.

Parker), Nicole Eggert (Summer Quinn), Susan Anton (Summer's mother, Jackie), and Wendie Malick (Gayle Buchannon, the ex-wife of team leader Mitch, played by star David Hasselhoff).  Combining the usual water rescues and crime-fighting, plus a fair amount of personal melodrama, the fourth season included a romantic triangle among Summer, Matt (David Charvet), and surfer Jimmy Slade (Kelly Slater), a haunted hotel, the Special Olympics (guest-starring Olympic gymnast Mary Lou Retton), and a proposal to turn the team's adventures into a network series calledRescue Bay.Yep, we said \"fourth season.\"  The set is entitled \"season 3,\" but its count begins with the series' first season in syndication--season 2--so this \"season 3\" is actually the fourth season, broadcast in 1993-94.  Included as a bonus, however, are two more episodes from the first season on NBC, \"Second Wave\" and \"Message in a Bottle.\"  The idea is that by the time seasons 2-11 ofBaywatchare on DVD, the bonus episodes will form a completed season 1.

{"description": "First screened in Europe and scheduled for limited release in the U.S.,The Illusionistoffers welcome proof that \"arthouse\" quality needn't be limited to the arthouses. Set in turn-of-the-century Vienna, this stately, elegant period film benefited from a crossover release in mainstream cinemas, and showed considerable box-office staying power--granted, teenage mallrats and lusty males may have been drawn to the allure ofSeventh Heavenalumna Jessica Biel, who rises to the occasion with a fine performance. But there's equal appeal in the casting of Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti, who bring their formidable talents to bear on the intriguing tale of a celebrated magician named Eisenheim (Norton) whose stage performance offends the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), a vindictive lout who aims to marry Duchess Sophie (Biel), Eisenheim's childhood friend and now, 15 years later, his would-be lover. This romantic rivalry and Eisenheim's increasingly enigmatic craft of illusion are investigated by Chief Inspector Uhl (Giamatti), who's under Leopold's command and is therefore not to be trusted as Eisenheim and Sophie draw closer to their inevitable reunion. Cleverly adapted by director Neil Burger from Steven Millhauser's short story \"Eisenheim the Illusionist,\" and boasting exquisite production values and a fine score by Philip Glass,The Illusionistis the kind of class act that fully deserved its unusually wide and appreciative audience. --Jeff ShannonBeyondThe Illusionist\"Eisenheim the Illusionist\" and Other StoriesPaul Giamatti in a More Loveable RoleMagic Kits & AccessoriesStills fromThe Illusionist", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000LC55F2", "B000NOIX48", "B002ZG980U", "B002WNU0QW", "B00DWZHTOU", "B001MZ5W3M", "B00011CZRE", "B000H0MKI8", "B00008K7AO", "B000L212HC", "B00AEBB8NI", "B000GFLKF8", "B000O76ZO4", "B00003CXZ4", "B00005JLSB", "B000FKO5QK", "B000M341QE", "B00AEFXGIY", "B00005V9HH", "B00AEBB8LA", "B00005JMOW", "B00096S49Y", "0767847415", "6305313687", "B004SIP9Z6", "B0047T74CM", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000R4SMCW", "B0002YLCG0", "B000P0J0EW", "B000HEWEE4", "B0041KKYHE", "B00BBI7EZY", "B00AEBBA2W", "B000CQLZ0Q", "0783235070", "0767802519", "B002ZG997C", "B00003CXHG", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000069HZP", "B004SIP7PS", "B003ASLJQI", "B00177Y9ZC", "B00005JLKN", "B003ZW9H68", "B001N44BVQ", "B002O3Z50Q", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005JN2Z", "B00AEBB86A", "B00000F4ZY", "B000MZHW40", "0671686402", "B00BB67UNW", "B005HP2J0M", "B000QXDED6", "B000NIVJF4", "B001F12J0C", "B000N6TX1I", "B000LAZE8C", "B00080ZG10", "B005LAIGRS", "B0009MDPYM", "0792159659", "B000OYC7BW", "B001UV4XGU", "B004AOECXI", "0767818105", "B000XR9L50", "B0018O4YT0", "B00015YVDG", "B004SIP8JI", "B00004XPPG", "B00006ZXSK", "B001DHXT20", "B0000AC8LR", "B009B8YMB0", "0783229402", "B0006210ZG", "B001PPGAIA", "B00004BZIY", "B008JFURII", "B00005JPAR", "B00006ADFM", "B004SIP7TE", "B000F5GNX8", "B000FS9FCG", "B006P0FIGU", "B00005JMCN", "B002VWNID6", "B004XQO90O", "B004EPZ084", "B00AEBB9M8", "B000P5FH3K", "B00005JNY3", "B000063US3", "B003L20IG0"], "bought_together": ["B000LC55F2", "B002ZG980U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000LC55F2", "B005LAIHXQ", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00DV2MVWO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 60145}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B000K7VHPU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nYghoS63L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Illusionist (Full Screen Edition)"}
{"description": "Zhang Yimou's heartfelt feature about cultural displacement, grief, and reconciliation is a lovely and somewhat unexpected work from the director ofRaise the Red LanternandHouse of Flying Daggers. Japanese actor Ken Takakura stars as Gou-ichi Takata, a laconic man who lives in a fishing village and is estranged from his son. When word reaches him that his son is ill with cancer, Takata travels to Tokyo but is turned away. Takata learns that his son has a passion for rural Chinese folk opera, and he flies to mainland China to locate Li Jiamin (playing himself), an opera star who happens to be in jail at the moment. Takata's story reminds Li of his own sad disconnection from his young son, and Takata sets out to restore their relationship as a prelude to helping his own with Li's help. Zhang himself is unusually operatic here, with intense emotions flying around, prettified visions of nature, and characters--including prison guards and peasants--who seem idealized, both as folklore and even old, Maoist notions of cooperation. Zhang's longtime admirers will appreciate and understand this change of pace from a filmmaker whose relationship with Chinese officials has often been strained over content. But film fans less familiar with his body of work will enjoyRiding Aloneas well. --Tom KeoghStills fromRiding Alone for Thousands of Miles(click for larger image)MoreRiding Alone for Thousands of Mileson Amazon.comMore Films by Yimou ZhangMore Films Starring Ken TakakuraMore Films from China", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000C2IW7", "B000F1IO02", "B00005QFE5", "0767853512", "B00006RCL3", "B000AYELXI", "B000GDH9J6", "B000067IX5", "B000EAT23M", "B00005N5RN", "B001BHTNAY", "B00005JM6H", "B005B0QYSQ", "B0060KGSGO", "6305460183", "B00007JZVS", "B001CCY42U", "B000PMFS6O", "B0019Z3P5W", "B0007Q6VXC", "B0006FFRB6", "B000W0H5GA", "B00HQFA1VA", "B004SIP88Y", "B006MWA91A", "B005KG4CUS", "B004DMIJ0E", "B00104AYGK", "B000C8ST80", "B00004VVO5", "B00AIBZLHS", "B00008HCCI", "B00AN5LCXQ", "B000KHX70S", "B009DAYI8S", "B00003CXR4", "B002U4F5W2", "B00003CXUM", "B004WJT5G0", "B000GIXE86", "B0087OULO6", "B002SF9YNO", "B000EZ7ZYK", "B00005KCB5", "B006H3KQSK", "B006IW8E3Y", "B0002V7S34", "B0007WQHO4", "B000ARXF96", "B00BC1UPRO", "B000GBEWPC", "B00116VG3M", "B00065GX0K", "B004CGUBZW", "B007SLF9ZA", "B0009XRZQK", "B000LXHK0E", "B00005JKG1", "B001CD6GL6", "0393328597", "B000059TON", "B00005YRQ2", "6305428557", "B000025RE7", "B00ET2ODYY", "B000811672", "0385722206", "B004M9ZI0M", "B0009P7EI2", "B000EHRVMY", "B00005UM27", "B002QMV13U", "630342063X", "B000BJG1NU", "B000ASDFYK", "B001H5ZQHY", "B004Y5R0E6", "B003N4XCTQ"], "bought_together": ["B0000C2IW7", "B000F1IO02"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000F1IO02", "B00005QFE5", "B0000C2IW7", "0767853512"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 177782}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.5, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000KX0IPE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51qvVHSTQLL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Riding Alone For Thousands of Miles"}
{"description": "From Lucy-tormented Hollywood A-listers and bongo-propelled production numbers to archival goodies such as long-lost footage, there is much to love in this collection of all 13 episodes fromThe Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show(also known asThe Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour). FollowingI Love Lucy'ssixth and final season, these monthly (give or take) specials reunited America with Ricky and Lucy (and Keith Thibodeaux's adorable Little Ricky, still living the country life in Connecticut. The expanded, hour-long format allowed for celebrity guest stars and excursions to far-flung locales, such as Japan and Mexico. Not matter where they go, Lucy can always be counted on to act, in Desi's words, \"a little crazy in the head,\" which is how she winds up masquerading as Ernie Kovacs' chauffeur in \"Lucy Meets the Moustache\" (an episode making its home-video debut), dangling Milton Berle from a construction crane in \"Milton Berle Hides Out at the Ricardos,\" or sparking a uranium uproar in Las Vegas in \"Lucy Hunts Uranium.\"A highlight of this set is the first-ever home video release of the uncut version of \"Lucy Takes a Cruise to Havana,\" a flashback episode in which Lucy meets Ricky on a \"maiden voyage\" to Cuba. She also meets future best friend Ethel (Vivian Vance) and her new husband Fred (a toupeed William Frawley), and goes overboard for her first celebrity sighting, Rudy Vallee. Because these episodes do not play as often in syndication, they seem fresher than their endlessly re-run counterparts. They are full of delights for movie, TV, andLucybuffs, among them, Fred MacMurray getting \"Uranium\" fever, Maurice Chevalier singing \"Yankee Doodle Boy\" in the \"Mexico\" episode, prolific character actor Sid Melton as a bellboy in the \"Alaska\" episode, and a va-voom Vance decked out as maid and a dance hall girl, respectively, in the \"The Celebrity Next Door\" and \"Milton Berle\" episodes. Among this set's prodigious bonus features include 1951 color footage that an audience member surreptitiously filmed, rediscovered scenes that were cut from the original broadcasts, and a filmed presentation to Westinghouse, which sponsored the series.

{"description": "Anyone who seeks out a Steven Seagal movie has certain expectations:  Bone-crunchingly brutal martial arts action; spiritual or ecological wisdom uttered in Seagal's hoarse monotone; and one long relentless scowl.Flight of Furyfails to deliver on all counts. Seagal plays an ex-military guy who's the only man who can retrieve a stolen stealth fighter. So he goes to Afghanistan, where he teams up with a sexy agent of some kind (Ciera Payton, making her cinematic debut) to shoot a bunch of Afghan mercenaries and fly away. The only plausible explanation for this movie's existence is that Seagal and his producers bought some stock footage of jet fighters and decided to build a story around it. The action scenes are murky, brief, and edited to compensate for Seagal's increasing bulk. The rote dialogue--co-written by Seagal--is recycled from a dozen other action movies. And Seagal can't even muster the energy to frown, let alone scowl.
