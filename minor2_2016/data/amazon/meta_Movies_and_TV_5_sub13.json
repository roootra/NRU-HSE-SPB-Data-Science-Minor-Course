{"description": "Before Robert Rodriguez'sEl Mariachi, Mexicans in North American action films were typically maids, drug dealers, or prison inmates. Even if the Cisco Kidwasa friend of yours, you handled a dust cloth or a Mac-10 if you lasted in Hollywood longer than a New Yorkminuto. But whenEl Mariachicrossed the border in 1992, things changed. Granted, it still involved a drug lord in a shoot-em-up, bang-bang, but this time the good guy was aMexican. Austin-based Rodriguez madeEl Mariachifor a fistful of pesos and a little help from his friends. He wrote, directed, coproduced, edited,andoperated the camera. Plus, he assembled a cast that had never acted before to workpor nada. All for a paltry $7,000, a milagro without a beanfield war.Desperadocontinues the outrageous action adventure. Working with a much bigger budget, Rodriguez returns the nameless mariachi to nonstop action. Again thrust into a world he never made, the hero takes his guitar-case arsenal deep into the criminal labyrinth of Bucho (Joaquim de Almeida),el gran chingonof the Mexican drug lords. With an amigo (Steve Buscemi) and a beautiful bookstore owner (Salma Hayek),el mariachiconfronts an outrageous cast along the way, including a bartender (Cheech Marin), a drug deal pick-up guy (Quentin Tarantino), and the original mariachi (coproducer Carlos Gallardo) as a new-found compa'. Antonio Banderas has the lead this time, and if he's not quite up to the challenge, it's probably because he'sSpanish, not Mexican, a distinction not lost by anyone raised on what the popular media now calls \"ethnic food.\" That said,Desperadois not to be missed. Using intelligence, romance, and humor--as well as plenty of explosive, surreal violence--Rodriguez again showcases the timeless struggle between the forces of darkness and light. And, in the process, he's recasting the mold for the contemporary action hero--kids now argue about who gets to play theMexican.--Stephan Magcosta", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000WN140", "B004P7CN5O", "B004P7CMOQ", "B0000A2ZU1", "B002ZG98C8", "0452271878", "B006LOBZSA", "B004U7MR14", "B004P7CN7W", "B0045HCJ5S", "B000UAE7O0", "6305692688", "0767802519", "B00E8G5HXM", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B00008975Z", "B004SIP9Z6", "6305327041", "B0002TT0MI", "B00000JDIQ", "B00GDDNFDW", "B000ARXF96", "B000H5TH1Q", "B000R7HY0K", "B00004Y87O", "B007D5E7C2", "B00005AUKC", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B000P0J0D8", "B0002RQ3M0", "B00AEFYV9W", "B00008RH3L", "B0007PALZ2", "B000E5KURY", "B004SIP7S0", "B005J9ZFQG", "B00CAATSME", "B003B3NV8G", "B0095ZIHZ6", "B00H9KKGTO", "B004SIP95G", "B000ASATYY", "B004CJQVO4", "B000286RP2", "B00AEBB86A", "B000CEXGAU", "B002ZG98LO", "B0045HCJTO", "B000K7VHNW", "B005F9TQ1K", "B000O76ZQC", "0446674621", "B00AEFXJ86", "B00004XPPB", "B00AEBB89W", "B000E5N684", "B001152TL6", "B00AEFYKWU", "B00AEFYDM2", "B002VWNICC", "B002OVO18A", "B0007OCG5G", "B000SULWKO", "B00G5GNYY2", "B005TK0MFE", "B000AYELVU", "B002FU8IWU", "B000GGSMC6", "B0062P3392", "B000U1ZV8K", "B0009ZE9VW", "B0045HCIYA", "B00049QJ9I", "B0009MDPYM", "B00005JM5B", "B00005JKYX", "0790732149", "B00008AOVL", "B00000ILDD", "B0030A6ICG", "B001EAWMGA", "B0067QPVJ6", "6305258287", "B00003CWM3", "B001CDFY50", "B004SIP8WU", "B0002KVUKM", "0783229402", "B001FB55HQ", "B0085A9HU6", "B000RETOH4", "B001OST0M6", "B004P7CNC2", "B000MGB6NM", "B0015TX2LO", "B000FA57US", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B001HN69AY", "B00005JN2Z"], "bought_together": ["B0000WN140"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000ASDFI6", "B0000A2ZTY", "B0000A2ZU1", "B0000WN140"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 141275}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.95, "brand": "Columbia/Tristar Studios", "asin": "0767811054", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BY9S5KF7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "El Mariachi / Desperado"}
{"description": "Film buffs and critics can argue until their faces turn blue about whether this lavish Dickensian musical deserved the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1968, but the movie speaks for itself on grandly entertaining terms. Adapted from Dickens's classic novel, it's one of the most dramatically involving and artistically impressive musicals of the 1960s, directed by Carol Reed with a delightful enthusiasm that would surely have impressed Dickens himself. Mark Lester plays the waifish orphan Oliver Twist, who is befriended by the pickpocketing Artful Dodger (Jack Wild) and recruited into the gang of boy thieves led by Fagin (played to perfection by Ron Moody). The villainous Bill Sikes (Oliver Reed) casts his long shadow over Oliver and his friends, but the young orphan is still able to find loving care in the most desperate of circumstances. Full of memorable melodies and splendid lyrics,Oliver!is a timeless film, prompting even hard-to-please critic Pauline Kael to call it \"a superb demonstration of intelligent craftsmanship,\" and to further observe that \"it's as if the movie set out to be a tribute to Dickens and his melodramatic art as well as to tell the story of Oliver Twist.\"--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B0000VCZKM", "B000RPCK2E", "B005NFJAZS", "B00G9EOQ8I", "B0001I55TC", "B00000F17A", "B000026FAZ", "B001J4E1CY", "B000002W8R", "B002HK9IDQ", "B000BITV92", "B0000AM6IY", "0780021312", "B000HT3PGU", "B0001WTUJE", "B0045HCJJY", "B00D3K357O", "B0006HBV3W", "B00005JL1P", "B00012FXJ0", "B007P7UF0G", "B00004TVUD", "B00AATV0WS", "B000BYA4HE", "B001PO550A", "B000002SLN", "0792839749", "B0090XLDKY", "6305320802", "B00005AUKE", "B003BZXIA0", "B00AEFY6DI", "B000KJTGHO", "0767827651", "B0007Z0O9U", "B0001US8F8", "B009Z59782", "B00011D1OK", "B00005MEOU", "B0045HCJQM", "B0007939PW", "B000HT3PGK", "B000AP04OM", "B0000549B1", "B001PO54V0", "B001GLX6TY", "B000VKL6RK", "B00004XMTJ", "B000025BD5", "B0009S4IKQ", "B000BT970O", "B000LPR6GA", "B00006RCO3", "B000XJD34I", "B000TPTCP0", "B009NYF2GQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000VCZKM", "B00E9ZATKI", "B000RPCK2E", "B005NFJAZS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 371247}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0767812417", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517WF2e1VhL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "OLIVER! 30th Tribute Edition"}

{"description": "This smart, tautly directed thriller from Wolfgang Petersen is about the cat-and-mouse games between a Secret Service agent named Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) and the brilliant, psychopathic assassin (John Malkovich) who's itching to get the President in his cross hairs. The back-story--Horrigan is haunted by his inability to prevent John Kennedy's assassination (Eastwood is computer-generated into archival footage)--is more than a little hokey, but the plotting itself is smartly, even ingeniously, constructed. Petersen manages a viselike grip on the tension and Eastwood even gets to deliver an ever-more-timely lecture on the diminished nature of the office of President. Eastwood's as gruff and as infuriating to the by-the-book Powers That Be as ever, and Malkovich oozes delightful menace. Renee Russo capably costars as a colleague with whom Horrigan gets friendly.--David Kronke", "related": {"also_bought": ["0800125762", "6303020089", "6303257844", "0790751305", "6304259131", "6304458975", "630118663X", "079073172X", "6305718792", "6303269834", "0783222955", "0792116887", "0790731274", "6302935148", "0790748169", "079212569X", "0790751267", "0800199421", "6303313345", "B000003KHS", "6300214540", "6303383300", "6301208773", "B000065U6Q", "6300214060", "6300184013"], "bought_together": ["0800125762"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 618072}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.75, "brand": "", "asin": "0767821920", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DPHTZZJYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "In the Line of Fire [VHS]"}
{"description": "As long as there is a need for adolescent male sexual fantasy, there  will be an audience forHeavy Metal. Released in 1981 and based on stories from the graphic magazine of the same name (possibly the greatest publication to simultaneously provoke imagination and masturbation), the film has since become the most popular single title in Columbia/TriStar's entire film library. That's an amazing fact considering just how silly and senseless the movie really is--an aimless, juvenile amalgam of disjointed stories and clashing visual styles, employing hundreds of animators from around the world with a near-total absence of creative cohesion. It remains, for better and worse, a midnight-movie favorite for the stoner crowd--a movie best enjoyed by randy adolescents or near-adults in an altered state of consciousness.With a framing story about a glowing green orb claiming to be the embodiment of all evil, the film shuttles through eight episodic tales of sci-fi adventure, each fueled by some of the most wretched rock music to emerge from the 1980s. The most consistent trademark is an abundance of blood-splattering violence and wet-dream sex, the latter involving a succession of huge-breasted babes who shed their clothes at the drop of a G-string. It's all quite fun in its rampantly brainless desire to fuel the young male libido, and for all its incoherenceHeavy Metalremains impressive for the ambitious artistry of its individual segments. Courtesy of producer Ivan Reitman (who'd just scored a hit withStripes), voice talents include several Canadian veterans of Second City comedy, including John Candy, Harold Ramis, Eugene Levy, and Joe Flaherty.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004WG2D", "B0001NBMIK", "B00441GYP6", "B000002H4C", "B000A2LV4W", "B0006ZE7G2", "B000TZN7KQ", "B005K8RJME", "B000B8I9XQ", "B002A00J0O", "B009V8EG7U", "B0007YMV92", "B0045HCJKS", "0792846818", "B00BWQTUTS", "B00AEBBADG", "B009AVC922", "B00005PJ6S", "B0000AUHQC", "0790729342", "B006WNMI0Y", "0783226063", "B008ETVXQY", "B0033090D2", "B00000IXPN", "B0015Y9B0K", "B00000I1KK", "B0045HCJT4", "6305840083", "B001JV5BIA", "B00CHMBQM0", "B00005V1XW", "B00AEFXDO6", "B0016I0AJG", "B006W93ELK", "B001D8X72G", "B0001Z4OXS", "B001G0MFFG", "B00007AJGH", "B0038ZITIE", "B000E6ESEO", "B00005UEQX", "B000NJMJGG", "B0050PYNP8", "B00004Y87O", "B00000IREA", "B001AEF6C2", "B004MLEYTG", "B000BR9S96", "B000VXWK86", "B000KLQUMQ", "B00005BIU7", "B00009W5F2", "B0083V2W6I", "B002GHHHHO", "B00005R2IS", "B000G6BLRE", "B00E8G5HZ0", "B000HT3Q2I", "B00005ATQB", "B00AG4714S", "B000055Y0X", "B001O0TWXG", "0783231032", "B001GD6VTE", "B00000JRUQ", "6305594333", "0783241895", "B00004TX5G", "B008M4MB8K", "B00009VTYE", "B000JMK6LW", "B001DTPZNY", "B0002NY8XA", "B00005N7Z1", "B00006D295", "B0013D8LAE", "B009SQ9Q5M", "B0091G7BTM", "B0019UGYK0", "B000GBEWGQ", "B0018O5WUU", "B00003CXB1", "B00005O3VC", "B00K6D1FZU", "B00023P49M", "B00006FDCD", "B000096IAC", "0790731533", "B00BQ7GU1Y", "B00005AB62", "B0046XG48O", "B004XFZ4JK", "B00018D3ZA", "B00BMKGZVA", "B001O3M36Q", "0783228457", "B005IX3C4U", "B002O3Z50Q"], "bought_together": ["B00004WG2D", "B0001NBMIK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00542MH8W", "B0009RCPY8", "B005VU9LO0", "B00441GYP6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15593}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 16.29, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "0767836316", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515xekZ6ovL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Heavy Metal (Collector's Edition)"}

{"description": "Unanimously hailed as one of the greatest masterpieces in the history of the motion picture,Seven Samuraihas inspired countless films modeled after its basic premise. But Akira Kurosawa's classic 1954 action drama has never been surpassed in terms of sheer power of emotion, kinetic energy, and dynamic character development. The story is set in the 1600s, when the residents of a small Japanese village are seeking protection against repeated attacks by a band of marauding thieves. Offering mere handfuls of rice as payment, they hire seven unemployed \"ronin\" (masterless samurai), including a boastful swordsman (Toshiro Mifune) who is actually a farmer's son desperately seeking glory and acceptance. The samurai get acquainted with but remain distant from the villagers, knowing that their assignment may prove to be fatal. The climactic battle with the raiding thieves remains one of the most breathtaking sequences ever filmed. It's poetry in hyperactive motion and one of Kurosawa's crowning cinematic achievements. This is not a film that can be well served by any synopsis; it must be seen to be appreciated (accept nothing less than its complete 203-minute version) and belongs on the short list of any definitive home-video library.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000K0YM0Y", "B001BEK8E2", "B000K0YLZ0", "B00005B1ZL", "B007N5YK10", "B002E01MBA", "B00K5EJHGO", "B00005JLEJ", "B00687XNNK", "B0009WIE2A", "B004XQO8MS", "B001WLMOL4", "B000059TFW", "B000AQKUD6", "B00180R072", "B00005JLMU", "B000067IY6", "B00005UQ7T", "B000E5LEV0", "B000ASATM6", "B000BR6QCI", "B0001UZZSG", "B00005QAPH", "6305081034", "B0007989YS", "B00065GX0K", "B006H3KQSK", "B001PCNZJU", "B00005JLV7", "B005JJCMN0", "B000WEH74G", "B00065GX64", "6305028699", "B00AEFYSEA", "B000V7HFL4", "0792841409", "0780021061", "B000AQKUH2", "B005HK13S6", "B0017MO0U6", "B00B2BYXSQ", "B001LMU1B4", "B0040QYROA", "B0050FXDDQ", "0783225903", "B0045HCJTO", "0780021045", "B0012SY0E6", "B000055Y0X", "B00EO2I6W4", "B001LMU1C8", "B00158K0RO", "B00004W3HF", "B000MM0LEG", "B004S801ZO", "B008VF0Y02", "0780020707", "B000XPSC0C", "B00003CXBU", "B000025RE7", "B00006ADD5", "0780022343", "0783226039", "B000056NWP", "B00005NC66", "6305257450", "B002ZG4Q5W", "B007Y1NR1W", "6304698798", "B000FDECGA", "B002IVDLH8", "B004M66YUS", "B00004Y7HL", "B002VRNJDA", "0767830555", "B0010YSD7W", "B004L9GMBC", "B001O549G6", "B003ZEQMH8", "B002VWNIAY", "B000VARC3C", "B003152Z4U", "B002U6DVPS", "B0000B1ODQ", "B00AEBB89C", "B008Y5OVZ8", "B0045HCJ9E", "B0087ZG7R0", "B005VU9LO0", "B0006GANN2", "B00AEFYL6K", "B00004TJKI", "B00DHN8FXG", "B0006GAOJA", "B003AWRMCE", "B000PKG6O4", "B00003CXR4", "B00HE01030", "B00ENNBZ68", "B006LLY8LY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005VU9LO0", "B001BEK8E2", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00008RH1H"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 158968}, "asin": "0780020685", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51175A95QSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Seven Samurai (Criterion Collection Spine #2)"}

{"description": "This 1986 fantasy/action thriller has since spawned two sequels, a popular syndicated TV series, numerous comic-book spinoffs, and a loyal (if somewhat oddly obsessive) following of fans. Directed by music video veteran Russell Mulcahy (which explains the dizzying camera work), the original theatrical release made hash of an intriguing story about an &quot;Immortal&quot; from 16th-century Scotland (Christopher Lambert) who time-leaps to modern-day America with his archenemy (Clancy Brown) in hot pursuit. It becomes a battle to the death (yes, Immortals can die), and Lambert seeks survival training from an Immortal mentor played by Sean Connery. Dazzling, energetic, and altogether confusing in its original form, the film has since been released on video, laserdisc, and DVD in this revised widescreen &quot;director's cut,&quot; with additional footage, director and producers' commentary, a photo and artwork archive, the original trailer, and an official time line of the film's evolution from script to screen.

{"description": "Something's wrong in the town of Santa Mira, California. At first, Dr. Miles Bennell (Kevin McCarthy) is unconcerned when the townsfolk accuse their loved ones of acting like emotionless imposters. But soon the evidence is overwhelming--Santa Mira has been invaded by alien &quot;pods&quot; that are capable of replicating humans and taking possession of their identities. It's up to McCarthy to spread the word of warning, battling the alien invasion at the risk of his own life. Considered one of the best science fiction films of the 1950s and '60s, this classic paranoid thriller was widely interpreted as a criticism of the McCarthy era (that's Senator Joseph, not actor Kevin), which was characterized by anticommunist witch-hunts and fear of the dreaded blacklist. Some hailed it as an attack on the oppressive power of government as Big Brother. However viewers interpret it, this original 1956 version ofInvaders of the Body Snatchers(based on Jack Finney's serialized novelThe Body Snatchers) remains a milestone movie in its genre, directed by Don Siegel with an inventive intensity that continues to pack an entertaining wallop. Look closely and you'll find future director Sam Peckinpah (an uncredited cowriter of this film) making a cameo appearance as a meter reader!--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000AQKU72", "B00009NHC0", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B00AEBB8VK", "B00005JKFR", "B000063UR0", "B00518A70E", "B000FVQLKW", "B000FOPPEC", "0783240953", "B00AEBB94G", "B000HEWEDK", "6305761078", "B0045HCJSA", "B002TSAAS8", "B000YDOOHI", "B000RXVNDI", "B00005R1O7", "B000EHQTZO", "6305869367", "B0007R4T26", "B000AYELJ2", "B00008438U", "B00D9EJFZA", "B00005JPUN", "0783240961", "B00027JYMG", "B0000648YD", "6305944288", "B000C20VNM", "B005ETANC2", "B000OHZJGO", "B0013XZ6SY", "B006TTC5J0", "0790742462", "B000QGEB1W", "B00000JQB7", "B001BSBBNK", "B0000694WH", "B00000K3U3", "B00D9EJFV4", "B0002V7O2Y", "B00000JMOF", "B000035Z3K", "B00005N5RM", "B0087ZG7PW", "B000EHSVJG", "B00DOZNGC2", "B003J216K4", "B00358MG8S", "B0045HCJKS", "B00007JMD8", "B00000IBTR", "B00009NHBC", "B0013D8LAE", "B000O78KWE", "B000UAFDR0", "B000Y2Q9J0", "B005HIBWBG", "B00HFWETZ8", "B000A0GOF0", "B00000ILEU", "B002945DUW", "B005OT7YX8", "B00AY586X4", "B00005JKU0", "B00026L8US", "B0019NB9A2", "B0009X770E", "B000P0J0BU", "B00158K1EQ", "B004QF71ZW", "B001DB6J50", "B00480OC0C", "B0087ZG7UW", "B004L9GMBC", "B0040QYROA", "B00005AUK9", "B000056NWI", "B00CUKTHES", "B000BMY2KG", "B00001TZ6Q", "B000SFJ4K4", "B0045HCJJE", "B005TMY00K", "B00003CXCF", "B00B94VJYW", "B005VU9LO0", "B003WTO5YI", "B000VX9WB4", "B00465I1BK", "B00009PY4A", "B0044O1Q60", "B00DZP1C9K", "B005AMJ3B0", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B003ZEQMH8", "B007Y1NR1W", "6305999872", "B005D0RDKM"], "bought_together": ["B00009NHC0", "B00AEBB8VK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000QQJ3Q0", "B00005JKFR", "B000HEWEDK", "B000AQKU72"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 112174}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 28.99, "brand": "Lions Gate Home Ent.", "asin": "0782009980", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5184JYCKAEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Invasion of the Body Snatchers"}

The IMAX edition that played in theaters in 2002 isshorterthan the original cut, so there is no new footage. The first major Hollywood film to be reprocessed for viewing on these massive screens,Apollo 13was shortened by 24 minutes so it could be loaded onto the gigantic reels in the IMAX theaters. The new cut delivers a mostly space-centered film; much of the domestic scenes (featuring Kathleen Quinlan's Oscar-nominated performance) are gone, which may help young space cadets get into the film. The IMAX print is also less wide than the theatrical version (1.66:1 versus 2.35:1) and delivers a DTS soundtrack not found on the theatrical version. Both prints are remastered and look grand. The main features from the initial DVD are intact (the making-of feature and two commentary tracks).

{"description": "After a career slump that plagued him through most of the 1980s, Al Pacino made a stellar comeback in this taut 1989 thriller, playing a weary New York police detective who falls in love with the woman (Ellen Barkin) who is the prime suspect in the murder case he's investigating. Expertly written by Richard Price and directed by Harold Becker, the story is designed to keep its central characters (and the viewer) in a state of constant suspicion and arousal--an emotional combination that sends dangerous sparks flying between Pacino and Barkin. Their chemistry is intense, and their love scenes are some of the hottest of any movie of its decade. ButSea of Loveis not merely concerned with cheap titillation. It's a riveting whodunit with scenes of nail-biting suspense and memorable dialogue that make it as interesting to listen to as it is to watch. Barkin had made a similarly sexy impression inThe Big Easy, and here she gives one of the best performances of her underrated career, matching Pacino's excellence scene for scene. The ending's a bit of a letdown because the murder solution comes somewhat out of the blue, but it's the acting and suspense that you'll remember most--qualities that makeSea of Loveone of the best films of its kind.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305262268", "B0043X1FNQ", "B00BTYRB3U", "B000HC2LHG", "B00008L3S6", "B00441GYPG", "0783226845", "B00AEBB95K", "B00000K3TU", "B00013RC66", "6305308837", "6305310335", "B0000AM6JI", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B0045HCJIK", "B0043X1FKY", "B003LR5BD0", "B004SUDQ1S", "6305065551", "B000E5N684", "B00000JGHL", "B000A9QK6E", "B000CNESTE", "B00004XPPB", "0790730979", "B000CBCWRG", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005K3NU", "B00AEFYD9K", "B00005JLX2", "0792844874", "B00127RAGC", "B002AS463W", "B0015OKWL2", "B002AT8KAG", "B0002T7YQW", "B000C20VRS", "6305213305", "079073219X", "B0009GX1CO", "B00AEFYC96", "B000H5TH1Q", "B0045HCJ8K", "B00009Y3PV", "B00441GYOM", "B00000J11D", "B000LP6KMQ", "0767810872", "B00005U2KC", "B00009WVSL", "B000EQ5SRK", "B00AEFYD2M", "B004YCKKFK", "B00015YVDG", "B00AEFXN9G", "B00003CWRX", "B00BLF9FYA", "B00AEBB9N2", "B00005JO5L", "B00005K3NV", "B000069HZP", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00AEFXIIW", "B00AEBB9EG", "6305428484", "B001NY4WYC", "B000059TGB", "B00006RCNY", "B002VWNICC", "B00AEFXG2U", "B00006L91I", "B006GVN05O", "B000087F6M", "B000UGBOT0", "B00AEFXKZ8", "B003AWRMA6", "B001TK80D4", "B002NZK5RI", "076782170X", "B000A9QK5K", "B00005OLYF", "0767817729", "B004499LX0", "B0001US62I", "B000GNOSDG", "B0006GANN2", "B00005JLJW", "B00005JMIJ", "B00AEFXBPM", "B0006HBZBK", "B00AEFYW64", "B00007G1YQ", "B0001FGBW0", "B000FO0AA6", "B003INBNOS", "0767802616", "B000A2UBN4"], "bought_together": ["6305262268", "B000HC2LHG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00C7MW53E", "6305262268", "B000HC2LHG", "0783226845"]}, "price": 33.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 231594}, "asin": "0783226918", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G3SG0CZAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sea of Love"}

{"description": "Meet Joe Blackseemed almost fated to fail when it was released in 1998, but this romantic fantasy--a remake of 1934'sDeath Takes a Holiday--deserves a chance at life after box-office death. Although many moviegoers were turned off by director Martin Brest's overindulgent three-hour running time, those who gear into its deliberate pace will find thatMeet Joe Blackoffers ample reward for your attention.Brad Pitt plays Death with a capital D, enjoying some time on Earth by inhabiting the body of a young man who'd been killed in a shockingly sudden pedestrian-auto impact. Before long, Death has ingratiated himself with a wealthy industrialist (Anthony Hopkins) and pursues romance with the man's beautiful daughter (newcomer Claire Forlani), whom he'd briefly encountered while still an earthbound human. Under the assumed identity of \"Joe Black,\" he samples all the pleasures that corporeal life has to offer--power, romance, sex, and such enticing pleasures as peanut butter by the spoonful.But Death has a job to do, andMeet Joe Blackaddresses the heart-wrenching dilemma that arises when either father or daughter (the plot keeps us guessing) must confront his or her inevitable demise. The film takes its own sweet time to establish this emotional crisis and the love that binds Hopkins's semidysfunctional family so closely together.

{"description": "A movie that only true horror buffs could love,Army of Darknessis officially part 3 in the wild and wacky Evil Dead trilogy masterminded by the perversely inventive director Sam Raimi, who would later serve as executive producer of the popular syndicated TV seriesHercules: The Legendary Journeys.Raimi's favorite actor, Bruce Campbell, returns as Ash (hero of the first two Evil Dead flicks), a hardware-store clerk who is magically transported--along with his beat-up Oldsmobile and a chainsaw attachment for his severed left forearm--to the brutal battlefields of the 14th century. He quickly assumes power (who else in the Middle Ages packs a shotgun and a chainsaw?), and unites his band of medieval knights against the dreaded Army of the Dead. Raimi gleefully subverts almost every horror-movie clich&eacute; as he serves up a nonstop parade of blood, gore, and vicious sword-bearing skeletons--an affectionate homage to animator Ray Harryhausen's classicJason and the Argonauts. The frantic action is fun while it lasts, but even at 80 minutesArmy of Darknessnearly wears out its welcome. You know that Raimi can maintain the mayhem for only so long before it grows tiresome, and fortunately this madcap movie quits while it's ahead.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005J9ZFQG", "B000WC3864", "B008JFUNYG", "B001KEGR5M", "B0001LQJMQ", "B003S6S7TY", "B004GGU9K0", "B000QUCQX8", "B008CYDD7I", "B005J9ZE5I", "B00C6F61IW", "B004GGU9JQ", "B00004Y87O", "B000WC38FA", "B000AQ69QS", "B0006A9FKA", "B00IF8Q0YE", "B0013D8LAE", "B000RIWAVW", "B0002C9DK4", "B000F7CMPE", "B0001611DI", "B0000AOX0F", "B002LMSWN2", "B000FS9FE4", "B0002CHK1S", "157362408X", "B000IJ7A5Q", "B002GHHHG0", "B00D7AM6M0", "B000I2J68M", "B00009MGEM", "B001NPD9LS", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B000VKL6Z2", "B004SIP6LS", "B00007AJG4", "B002JT69IW", "0790729342", "B0009OUBC4", "B00005JA8B", "B001D5C1OO", "B000V4UFZK", "B00005LC4Q", "B0056P6SOG", "B004P7CMOQ", "B000UAE7O0", "B000WC389G", "B0016MJ6P6", "B000I0RNVQ", "B008WAM2E2", "B0001US7OA", "B00005N5RM", "B00AEFY2WI", "B000FJH5MC", "B000099T3M", "B004EI2NP4", "B00005JO16", "B008G33PIM", "B001DJLD1W", "B000TSIJWY", "B001DJLD0S", "B000AXWHSA", "B000FA57UI", "B00AEFXW8I", "B00018D42W", "B000068IEV", "B000S0GYRU", "B000FA57US", "6304712499", "B001B8XRT6", "B002VWNIDG", "B002OVO18A", "B0002ABURA", "B00006FDCD", "B00AEFYDM2", "B0028DRGDQ", "B008874968", "B0000AOX09", "B001KEGR5W", "B0000VCZNE", "0312291450", "B0087ZG7UW", "B0024FAG44", "B0053TWV46", "B0058I9DZM", "B003VMFWXO", "B003WTO5NO", "B0015U0QWG", "B004XVMCH6", "B004LWZW24", "B001B1UO6W", "B005HI4LMS", "B000LP6KNU", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00317LM8S", "B0031U8OEK", "B0024FADBA", "B000C20VRS"], "bought_together": ["B005J9ZFQG", "B000WC3864"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005J9ZFQG", "B00005R24K", "B008JFUNYG", "B009JBWOU0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22777}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.74, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "0783227434", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DQ0H428VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Army of Darkness"}
{"description": "It's hard to ignore the sad and conspicuous absence of the late John Belushi, but this long-delayed sequel to 1980'sThe Blues Brothersstill has Dan Aykroyd--as Chicago bad boy and blues rocker Elwood Blues--to keep the music alive. Once again, Elwood's trying to reunite the original Blues Brothers Band, and this time he's got a strip-joint bartender (John Goodman) and a 10-year-old orphan named Buster (J. Evan Bonifant) joining him at center stage. Believing that Elwood has kidnapped the kid, the cops are hot on his trail as the reunited band hits the road for the Battle of the Bands in Louisiana and the All-Star Blues Jam that ends the movie in a rockin' blaze of glory. It's a shameless clone of the first film, and nobody--especially not Aykroyd or director John Landis--seems to care that the story's not nearly as fun as the music that's used to stretch it out. Of course there's a seemingly endless parade of stunts, including a nonstop pileup of police cars that's hilariously absurd, but what really matters here--indeed, the movie's only saving grace--is the great lineup of legendary blues musicians. Aretha Franklin, James Brown, Junior Wells, Eric Clapton, B.B. King, Jonny Lang, Eddie Floyd, and Blues Traveler are among the many special guests assembled for the film, and their stellar presence makes you wonder if the revived Blues Brothers shouldn't remain an obscure opening act.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783231482"], "bought_together": ["0783231482"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 258505}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.49, "brand": "", "asin": "0783227078", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DGQ2RVTPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blues Brothers 2000 [VHS]"}
{"description": "Director John Carpenter and special makeup effects master Rob Bottin teamed up for this 1982 remake of the 1951 science fiction classicThe Thing from Another World, and the result is a mixed blessing. It's got moments of highly effective terror and spine-tingling suspense, but it's mostly a showcase for some of the goriest and most horrifically grotesque makeup effects ever created for a movie. With such highlights as a dog that splits open and blossoms into something indescribably gruesome, this is the kind of movie for die-hard horror fans and anyone who slows down to stare at fatal traffic accidents. On those terms, however, it's hard not to be impressed by the movie's wild and wacky freak show. It all begins when scientists at an arctic research station discover an alien spacecraft under the thick ice, and thaw out the alien body found aboard. What they don't know is that the alien can assume any human form, and before long the scientists can't tell who's real and who's a deadly alien threat. Kurt Russell leads the battle against the terrifying intruder, and the supporting cast includes Richard Masur, Richard Dysart, Donald Moffat, and Wilford Brimley. They're all playing standard characters who are neglected by the mechanistic screenplay (based on the classic sci-fi story \"Who Goes There?\" by John W. Campbell), but Carpenter's emphasis is clearly on the gross-out effects and escalating tension. If you've got the stomach for it (and let's face it, there's a big audience for eerie gore), this is a thrill ride you won't want to miss.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0067QPVJ6", "B00004Y87O", "B00009NHC0", "B000AM6OQ2", "B00000ILDD", "B0000AOX0F", "B0009X768W", "B0024FADD8", "B000QUCQX8", "B00AEFYDM2", "B00005N5RM", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B008CYDD7I", "B005J9ZFQG", "B00005N5S5", "B000FS9FE4", "B00I9TDMRM", "B0067QPVD2", "B000RIWAVW", "B00005JA8B", "B0000AOX0A", "B00005JKFR", "B005LAIHXQ", "B003XURDAY", "B0001611DI", "B00111YM5Q", "B003UGLCIA", "B0009X76XC", "0783227434", "B00008974J", "078062856X", "B001NPD9LS", "B002VWNIDG", "B0000VCZK2", "B004L9GMBC", "B000AQKU72", "B00003CXCF", "B000YDOOHI", "B0024FAG44", "B002ZG98LO", "B000GETUDI", "B000V4UFZK", "B00AEFYXQI", "B0008191WO", "B00AEBB8VK", "B000LP6KNU", "0790729342", "B000068IEV", "0783228457", "B0024FADBA", "B000WC3864", "B0002DB5PO", "B007STBUHI", "0982332203", "B00070FX5U", "B0045HCJKS", "B00AEFY31S", "B00004TS0G", "B000IHY9TS", "B000063UR1", "B00005N7Z1", "B001VLBDD0", "B000286RNE", "B00000ILDG", "B00023P4UQ", "B00D7AM6M0", "B000096I9V", "B003YDORO0", "B00005LC4Q", "B00008G8LY", "B00005R2IS", "B00009PY4G", "B000E8M0P6", "B00AEFY2AA", "B00005JMA8", "0783241895", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005K3NR", "6305090564", "B004SIP95G", "0790729695", "B0007PALZ2", "B00AEBB91E", "B004NWPY20", "B0010X73ZG", "B001FOK70S", "B002T9H2LA", "157362408X", "B00006FDCD", "B0045HCJT4", "B003Y5H4SO", "B004SIP92O", "B00009YXHN", "B00005JMEW", "B000P0J0AQ", "B00011CZRE", "B000I2J68M", "B00AKGG828", "B00009OWI1", "B003TRMLQM"], "bought_together": ["B0067QPVJ6", "B00009NHC0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00009NHC0", "B0067QPVJ6", "B0009X768W", "B000UBMSB8"]}, "price": 12.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 131304}, "asin": "0783227507", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HQTPF200L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Thing - Collector's Edition"}
{"description": "Ray Peterson (Tom Hanks) would like nothing better than to spend a quiet week's vacation in his suburban home, drinking beer and watching TV. But, spurred on by his two friends' spinning of boyish paranoid fantasies about their reclusive neighbors, the Klopeks, the usually down-to-earth Ray begins to suspect his idyllic neighborhood has been invaded by an evil force, to the point where he and his friends become psychotically nosey. You see where this is going, and you see it from a mile off.  Only the general surface-thin plot is somewhat offset by director Joe Dante's fine sense of the absurd, and a host of engagingly played neighbor-types, namely Rick Ducommun as Ray's best friend who's always proposing bad ideas, and Bruce Dern as a sometimes wild-eyed ex-vet who'd love some action.  Dante and crew seem to have a knack for keeping these broad characterizations light enough that you don't mind their superficiality. But the best jokes in this unprepossessing film come from composer Jerry Goldsmith's score; Bruce Dern's presence, for instance, is announced by the theme fromPatton, and the boys' first approach to the Klopeks' for a meet-and-greet is buttressed by classic strains from Sergio Leone spaghetti Westerns.  Kudos to the Klopeks, for their evil ways are ably embodied by Henry Gibson, Courtney Gains, and Brother Theodore.  In particular, any suburb that finds it's inhabited by the likes of Brother Theodore is in dire need of new zoning laws.  But Carrie Fisher's role as Ray's amiably long-suffering wife is thankless, and she deserves better.--Jim Gay", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005T7HZ", "B00005Y71F", "6305162018", "B00007GZQZ", "0783227884", "B00004RJ73", "B0002B15X8", "0790740044", "B00AEBB9E6", "B000065V3P", "0783227388", "B005QX8UEE", "B000P0J09W", "B0000648ZQ", "B001AEF6C2", "B00008G8LM", "B00441GYQ0", "6305236569", "B000ATQYWY", "6304698607", "B000YGDNPO", "B005LL817W", "B002O3Z4YI", "B0033PSHBI", "B008R65XKQ", "B0009ML1Z2", "B00005JKFA", "B000VBIGD6", "B0001AW14C", "B000BUE5E6", "B0088EDONK", "0767821467", "B0009RCPY8", "0790732157", "B000FO0AA6", "B00000IQC4", "0783232047", "B0087ZG7PW", "B00028HBES", "B0001I55UQ", "0783231644", "B00287Z18Y", "B00005QT9P", "B0000C3I99", "B000FO0A9W", "B000QUCQX8", "B00E1HIX66", "B0001I562I", "B00158K0QU", "B00005A8XX", "B0024FADAQ", "0783225733", "B00AEBB9DW", "0783225482", "B00D2UMHVK", "B000PMFS0A", "B0001ZX0O2", "B0087ZG7HK", "B00AENNHOE", "B00005T7I1", "B007STBUHI", "B00004TJQK", "B00GOT15IM", "B00D3LA6RK", "6305428042", "B00005JOJE", "B00008977A", "B002XUBDRY", "B00FAI3JE6", "B00AEFXPG2", "B0001EFTSS", "B000NJMJGG", "B0045HCJRG", "B00009VU01", "B00015YVD6", "B00C0E9LMW", "B000YDBPAM", "B0055CMM0O", "B000E6ESI0", "B005XB8SLE", "B000P0J0A6", "6305428050", "B0045HCJ7G", "B00008WFU4"], "bought_together": ["B00005T7HZ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000K7VHTQ", "B001O3M36Q", "B000P0J09W", "B00004RJ73"]}, "price": 10.28, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3520}, "asin": "0783233515", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G8BRQVWYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The 'Burbs"}

{"description": "Director Rob Reiner'sWhen Harry Met Sally...was about a relationship beginning;The Story of Usis about a relationship possibly coming to an end. Bruce Willis plays a comedy writer who chafes at what he sees as his wife's lack of spontaneity; Michelle Pfeiffer, who creates crossword puzzles, stews over what she sees as her husband's irresponsibility. The arc of their separation is interspliced with glimpses and scenes from their marriage--a combination of high points (the proposal, the births of their two children), low points (screaming fights), and the in-between (sessions with marriage counselors, moments in bed staring at the TV). Reiner indicates the passage of time by Willis and Pfeiffer's various hairstyles, and they occasionally let their hair act for them, but at other points their performances are sincere and deeply felt. The sheer power of the themes--the inevitability of conflict in a relationship, the necessity and difficulty of growth--give the movie a degree of emotional force, and there's no doubt that everyone who's gone through a difficult period in their marriage (which is just about every married couple) will find something to connect with. However, there isn't a lot of chemistry between the two leads. In one sequence Willis and Pfeiffer go to Venice to rekindle their old spark and find themselves hounded by another couple, the Kirbys from Cleveland, who are loud, crass, boring, and oblivious. Nonetheless, the Kirbys have a buoyancy that the glossy and elegant stars never quite manage; ifThe Story of Ushad been the story of them, it might have been a better story to watch.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00000F5MN", "B004GSVXCG", "B00319ECB0", "6305428034", "6305692572", "B00AEBBA2W", "B0099114WO", "B00006ZXSN", "B003BV8ICC", "6305428271", "B00005JCCB", "B0019PL2QQ", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B002K0WBXM", "B0043X1FLI", "B003C27X44", "B00005JKTP", "B0058ZPNBI", "B0009ETCUQ", "B00003CXQA", "B00AEBB9WI", "0767821718", "0767821513", "1558908331", "0767817761", "B000095WW8", "0790742446", "B0045HCJIK", "B000B2YR92", "B005F2JRUC", "B00006ZXSO", "B00AEFYXJ0", "6305428484", "B003YKYX9M", "B000U1ZV80", "B000BRP4BM", "B000087F7E", "B00002Z88B", "B00AEBB8NS", "B000NO39FG", "B00006ZXSI", "B009HIKAN8", "B002FU8IWU", "B002AS466O", "B00AEFYF2K", "B004499LWG", "B00000IQV7", "6301971345", "B000RO9Q7W", "0783226888", "B00096S49Y", "0767807588", "6304698747", "B002NZK5TQ", "B00008CMRK", "B000LP6KMQ", "B0001AVZA8", "B00AG51V8E", "0767815122"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00000F5MN", "B004GSVXCG", "B00319ECB0", "B000YDBPAM"]}, "price": 6.66, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 690149}, "asin": "0783240031", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41RPKQX44DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Story of Us"}
{"description": "Australian director Scott Hicks's follow-up to his widely belovedShinecomes as a small shock. Based on David Guterson'sbestselling novel,Snow Falling on Cedarsis far removed from the  character-driven, pure storytelling ofShineand a comparative plunge  into moody atmospherics. Action insinuates itself  through the director's determined eye for watercolor composition  and free-floating perspective, like random shoots of new growth in an  overwhelming rain forest. It's impossible to be complacent as a viewer  because Hicks's meditative style paradoxically forces one to locate and make  the story happen internally.The approach makes good aesthetic sense in that Guterson's story couches  courtroom drama in dreamy textures, and Hicks is determined to reflect that even if it means turning an audience's idea of narrative on its head. He also  gets a lot of help from the weather in the Pacific Northwest: the setting is  one of Washington State's San Juan Islands, where rain embraces earth and sky in a singular, introverted  personality. There, a Japanese American war hero (Rick Yune) stands  accused of murdering a white fisherman in the years following World  War&nbsp;II. His wife (Youki Kudoh) is the former childhood sweetheart and lover  of a  local newspaperman (Ethan Hawke) whose bitterness over the loss--as well as his helplessness during the internment of  Japanese Americans, and the crusading legacy of his journalist father (Sam  Shepard)--prevents him from coming to the defense of the accused man.Layered emotions, layered sensations, layered clouds. This is historical  fiction of a sort that works best as an experience of time's relativity:  flowing, stopping, trickling. Ironically, the film's most commercial element,  the trial, is the least interesting aspect, though old pro Max Von Sydow  makes those scenes great fun as a wily defense counsel.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EXDSCK", "B000NTPG7A", "067976402X", "B0051HCURS", "B004SIP6C2", "B00005MEVY", "B0009298P2", "B00005JKGK", "B005DCJ1J6", "B004SIP6QI", "0151001006", "B000038IDY", "B005KG4CUS", "B00197POZO", "1586634909", "B001KEHAEE", "B0012OX7EO", "B004SIP83Y", "B000CQLZ8S", "B00083FZFE", "B00FPUN21O", "B004SIP7F8", "0743457579", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B00G15MDI0", "B007RL2R9M", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B003EYVXRS", "B00166UFTS", "B002ZG99EK", "B0013XZ6X4", "B0045HCJRQ", "B000EHRVMY", "B00GUO2SKA", "B000RF7XYO", "B003ASLJQ8", "B000DN5W1G", "B001FB55L2", "B000P5FH3K", "B004UXUUDA", "B000HC2LHG", "B000056KMW", "B00H7LJ2UO", "B004UXUX4Q", "B004AE3QYE", "B009IQG5M4", "B002AT4PA0", "B00H9L26AA", "B008PJZDX2", "B0007OP1XA", "630523650X", "B00G7QPXUI", "B00BTYU3SK", "B00011Y1PI", "B00HLTD49C", "B004VHOAGS", "B00AEFY8MM", "B000BYRCQU", "6305428522", "B000QGEB1M", "B0006TPE4C", "B002OVB9YE", "B00007G1WH", "B004SIP71M", "B0064MT1LM", "0780619587", "B004SUDQ8G", "B000ZOXDFA", "B001CITQWM", "1477513981", "B00AEFXGIY", "0767811100", "B0071HPP3M", "B00GJT2OWS", "B0007QJ210", "B000BOH904", "B00JBGWP3Y", "B004SIP9U6", "B000R4SMCW", "B0007Z0NYQ", "B006FE83UE", "B000KX0IOA", "B004SIP8W0", "B004SEUJ82", "B0002O7XVI", "B001P9KR8U", "B00B4ZN3XQ", "B00028G7IO", "B0009W5IMO", "B004SEUJOQ", "B0001V6ZK2", "B000NOIX48", "B000P0J092", "6305428352", "6304883773", "B00GST8U4U", "B000I0RNV6", "B0064MT1FI", "B00005PJ6V", "B000P0J0AG"], "bought_together": ["067976402X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["067976402X", "B000NTPG7A", "B000EXDSCK", "B00005JKGK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 24564}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.49, "brand": "Universal", "asin": "0783240325", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513NKVN69ML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Snow Falling on Cedars"}

{"description": "Peter Sellers's third go-around as the prideful but bumbling Inspector Jacques Clouseau is funny enough, but this 1975 Blake Edwards revival of the Sellers-Clouseau connection is a little weak in comparison to predecessors \"The Pink Panther\" and \"A Shot in the Dark\" (both made in 1964). Costar Christopher Plummer actually gets some of the most interesting screen time as a retired cat burglar whom Clouseau accuses of getting back into the business. (If it sounds like there might be a \"To Catch a Thief\" vibe mixed in here, you're right.) Herbert Lom is hilarious as Clouseau's psychologically eroding boss, and Clouseau's ritualistic collisions with valet Cato (Burt Kwouk) are great examples of Edwards's delicious comic timing. \"--Tom Keogh\"", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001AG01M", "B000CEXFC4", "B0009S4J3C", "6305308748", "B0009S4J3M", "B0009S4J32", "B001HUWQGS", "B0009S4J4G", "B000CCBCDK", "B00260HH1M", "B001IHJ988", "B000VIMHPM", "B000FBH3V8", "B000055Y0X", "B00009MEKJ", "B00005RDRO", "B001LXIDUY", "B004FPXMG0", "B00005JKH9", "B00LC4PFVW", "B0009S4J2I", "B003NTUOGU", "B00005JL0I", "B000CEXFBK", "B0001Y9YJ8", "B0000CBY1C", "B001EZE5FG", "B001KEHAHQ", "B000CNFC4E", "B001KMB7DG", "B001IHJ974", "B0007R4SX6", "B00AEFXDO6", "B000NDEXPM", "B00132D7XQ", "B0045HCJ9E", "B000G6BLWE", "B00014NEX0", "B00D3LA6AW", "B000FZETR0", "B00009YXEW", "B003L2BZ0I", "B00AEFYRJQ", "B000063K2R", "B00005O3VC", "B0000AUHPB", "B0045HCJHG", "B001NPD9R2", "B0045HCJ7G", "B00008MTW6", "B000NDEXPC", "B000C20VNM", "B008YAPQX4", "B0009S4J28", "B004EPZ00C", "B0024FADAQ", "0783225903", "B0065N6K9Q", "B00077BPF0", "B0018KGVA4", "B000O599NK", "B00AEFYT1W", "B00004RG62", "B001D7T6AO", "B000M53GLS", "B00K6J7Q6G", "B000WTVZHQ", "B000ATQYT2", "B000NIBUS0", "B000E6ESI0", "B00066FBQG", "B000FFJYAM", "B001LMAK6A", "B001PO550A", "B00151QYYE", "B00009IB1F", "B001AXOFR0", "B00005JXY3"], "bought_together": ["B0001AG01M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001AG01M", "B0009S4J3C", "6305308748", "B000CEXFC4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 184019}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.84, "brand": "", "asin": "0784012644", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QP9KH894L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Return of the Pink Panther"}

{"description": "It always comes up when people are comparing their most traumatic movie experiences: \"the death of Bambi's mother,\" a recollection that can bring a shudder to even the most jaded filmgoer. That primal separation (which is no less stunning for happening off-screen) is the centerpiece ofBambi, Walt Disney's 1942 animated classic, but it is by no means the only bold stroke in the film. In its swift but somehow leisurely 69 minutes,Bambicovers a year in the life of a young deer. But in a bigger way, it measures the life cycle itself, from birth to adulthood, from childhood's freedom to grown-up responsibility. All of this is rendered in cheeky, fleet-footed style--the movie doesn't lecture, or make you feel you're being fed something that's good for you. The animation is miraculous, a lush forest in which nature is a constantly unfolding miracle (even in a spectacular fire, or those dark moments when \"man was in the forest\"). There are probably easier animals to draw than a young deer, and the Disney animators set themselves a challenge with Bambi's wobbly glide across an ice-covered lake, his spindly legs akimbo; but the sequence is effortless and charming. If Bambi himself is just a bit dull--such is the fate of an Everydeer--his rabbit sidekick Thumper and a skunk named Flower more than make up for it. Many of the early Disney features have their share of lyrical moments and universal truths, butBambiis so simple, so pure, it's almost transparent. You might borrow a phrase from Thumper and say it's downright twitterpated.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["155890641X", "0788812807", "6302642248", "0788802194", "6302320402", "6304401132", "078881172X", "6304500831", "6303314015", "6300274195", "0788812408", "6302526574", "6302787068", "6302961572", "6300274268", "6305229449", "6303983812", "0788803743", "6304089767", "B0000AQZYM", "B000035Z2S", "6305319138", "6300275310", "0788805843", "0788805533", "6303929338", "6302158095", "6302178924", "6304100507", "B00005JKDQ", "6304400551", "6305326940", "6304290888", "6304978286", "6304400225", "6305940932", "B00004R99N", "6303036813", "6301390725", "B00003CX7L", "B0000E32WB", "6304089201", "B00000ICHA", "B000B8QG3G", "B0000524CZ", "6302426200", "6304501153", "B00003CXQX", "B00005T7H6", "1558906150", "6300274608", "B00000JS61", "6303534422", "B0009SUS4Q", "6304400381", "B00004R99I", "B000009CTR", "6302484359", "6301991311", "B00005RDVV", "B0007A2GSM", "B00003CXHR", "0788811002", "B000035Z46", "B00005RRG3", "6300276554", "6303122647", "6303123244", "6304401736", "0788812181", "B00006IUM9", "1558901892", "6301948106", "6305942285", "6300277003", "B00003CWPW", "6304015127", "B00007AJLB", "B00005JL95", "0788810634", "6304873441", "6303295614", "6303939015", "0783236689", "6304117752", "B00016JF2W", "B000BAVLYS", "0788812440", "B0002YLCHE", "6302481805", "6304155972", "6303991408", "B00008Y47S", "B00003CXXI", "B000B8QG4A", "6302961661", "B00003CXQ6", "B0001I55VK", "B00004YNUH"], "bought_together": ["155890641X", "0788802194"], "also_viewed": ["155890641X", "0788802194", "6303314015", "0788812408", "6304500831", "6302526574", "6302320402", "078881172X", "6302642248", "6302787068", "0788812807", "6300274195", "6304401132", "6302961572", "6304089767", "6300274268", "0788805843", "B000035Z2S", "6304290888", "0788805533", "6305319138", "6303983812", "6305229449", "6303929338", "6300275310", "6302178924", "6304400551", "B0000AQZYM", "6302158095", "6303534422", "B00005JKDQ", "B0007KTBIU", "6305326940", "B00003CXQX", "6304501153", "6303036813", "B000B8QG3G", "6304100507", "B00004R99N", "6305940932", "B00003CXHR", "6304978286", "B000035Z46", "B00005JL95", "B00005RDVV", "B005JQFQ5Y", "B00003CX7L", "6304873441", "6304089201", "6304400225", "6302426200", "6301991311", "6304401736", "0788811002", "B0000524CZ", "6300274608", "6301390725", "B00016JF2W", "B00004REYY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 63167}, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Children's Music", "Disney"], ["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.94, "brand": "Disney", "asin": "0788806270", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DVF3SBVRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bambi (Walt Disney's Masterpiece) [VHS]"}
{"description": "Robin Williams won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, and actors Matt Damon and Ben Affleck nabbed one for Best Original Screenplay, but the feel-good hitGood Will Huntingtriumphs because of its gifted director, Gus Van Sant. The unconventional director (My Own Private Idaho,Drugstore Cowboy) saves a script marred by vanity and clunky character development by yanking soulful, touching performances out of his entire cast (amazingly, even one by Williams that's relatively schtick-free). Van Sant pulls off the equivalent of what George Cukor accomplished for women's melodrama in the '30s and '40s: He's crafted an intelligent, unabashedly emotional male weepie about men trying to find inner-wisdom.Matt Damon stars as Will Hunting, a closet math genius who ignores his gift in favor of nightly boozing and fighting with South Boston buddies (co-writer Ben Affleck among them). While working as a university janitor, he solves an impossible calculus problem scribbled on a hallway blackboard and reluctantly becomes the prodigy of an arrogant MIT professor (Stellan Skarsg&#229;rd). Damon only avoids prison by agreeing to see psychiatrists, all of whom he mocks or psychologically destroys until he meets his match in the professor's former childhood friend, played by Williams. Both doctor and patient are haunted by the past, and as mutual respect develops, the healing process begins. The film's beauty lies not with grand climaxes, but with small, quiet moments. Scenes such as Affleck's clumsy pep talk to Damon while they drink beer after work, or any number of therapy session between Williams and Damon offer poignant looks at the awkward ways men show affection and feeling for one another.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FVQLQQ", "B000P0J0EW", "6305144168", "B0043X1FL8", "B00000IQV7", "B00AEFY0F2", "B0000YEEGM", "B00JPQ1INI", "B004FQX5B6", "0800141741", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00562D3Y2", "B00125WAWS", "0783226845", "B003ASLJQS", "B00005JLRZ", "B000M341QE", "B0034G4P7G", "B002ZG99N6", "B000N4RAR4", "0767811100", "6305428352", "B000P0J0EM", "B00009W5CA", "B002NZK5UK", "B003ASLJO0", "B00003CWQR", "B004SIP7VM", "B000B8QG22", "B00005V9HH", "B001F34HRS", "B004AOECXI", "B000N6U0E2", "B00AEFXYJA", "079284646X", "B0043X1FM2", "B00AEFY17E", "B000066HAS", "B000PHVZNE", "B003AWRMC4", "B00000G3PA", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00005JKWX", "B000MZHW40", "B000Z8GZYW", "B0018CWW5K", "B000P0J0C4", "B000P0J09M", "B00004BZIY", "B00B0U2SFE", "B003AWRMCE", "B00001ZWUS", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005B6JZ", "B00005JLSB", "B0002ZDVEU", "6305428271", "B000FKO5QK", "B00AEBB9SM", "B00007GZR5", "B001SN78JO", "B000QQLVPQ", "630587493X", "B0001ADAVK", "B004WCTLNY", "0792843592", "B00AEBBA36", "B000FVQLRA", "B00AEFXXMI", "B000XJD33O", "B0002WZTOI", "B00004XPPG", "B00008G8M4", "B00AEBB9LO", "B000056VP4", "B006VRRGNK", "6305313687", "B0006FYOTC", "B001QERPAC", "B002O3Z4WK", "B001680M26", "B00AEFY4CG", "B000YDBPAM", "B0068FZ0GK", "0767836359", "B00005JN2Z", "B000765IJK", "B00008NFR4", "630471193X", "B002NZK5VO", "B000EGDB10", "B000068MBX", "B00000J122", "B00AMSLDTM", "B000MNOX94", "B000R4SMCW", "B00009AOBI", "B000XR9L50", "B00005JOC9"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000P0J0EW", "B000M341QE", "0783226845", "B002ZG99N6"]}, "price": 8.67, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 107799}, "asin": "0788814664", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EQNMPT51L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Good Will Hunting"}
{"description": "Disney's adaptation of the beloved fairy tale became a classic in its  own right, thanks to some memorabletunes(including \"A Dream Is a Wish  Your Heart Makes,\" \"Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo,\" and the title song) and some endearingly cute comic relief. We all know the story--the wicked stepmother and stepsisters simply won't have it, this uppity Cinderella thinking she's going to a ball designed to find the handsome prince an appropriate sweetheart, but perseverance, animal buddies, and a well-timed entrance by a fairy godmother make sure things turn out all right. There are a few striking sequences of pure  animation--for example, Cinderella is reflected in bubbles drifting through the air--and the design is rich and evocative throughout. It's a simple story padded here agreeably with comic business, particularly Cinderella's rodent pals (dressed up conspicuously like the dwarf sidekicks of another famous Disney heroine) and their misadventures with a wretched cat named Lucifer. There's also much harrumphing and exposition spouting by the King and the Grand Duke. It's a much simpler and more graceful work than the more frenetically paced animated films of today, which makes it simultaneously quaint and highly gratifying.--David Kronke", "related": {"also_bought": ["155890641X", "6304401132", "0788812408", "6302526574", "0788806270", "0788812807", "6303314015", "6302642248", "6302787068", "078881172X", "6302320402", "6304500831", "6305229449", "6300274268", "6300274195", "B000035Z2S", "0788803743", "6303983812", "6304089767", "0788805843", "6302961572", "6303929338", "6300275310", "6304290888", "6305319138", "B0000AQZYM", "6302178924", "6304400551", "B00005JKDQ", "0788805533", "6305940932", "6302158095", "B00003CX7L", "B00005T7H6", "6304978286", "6305326940", "6304501153", "6304089201", "B00003CXQX", "6304100507", "B00000JS61", "B0009SUS4Q", "6303534422", "B00005RDVV", "B00000ICHA", "6304400225", "B000JBWWRO", "B00004R99N", "6300274608", "B00005JL95", "6303036813", "6304873441", "B00005JKX3", "6304117752", "0788811002", "1558901892", "B00003CXHR", "6301390725", "6303122647", "6303939015", "0788812440", "6305942285", "1558906150", "B0000524CZ", "6300276554", "6301991311", "0792839129", "0788810634", "B00004R99I", "B0000E32WB", "6302426200", "B00003CWPW", "6304492960", "6304400381", "6301948106", "6301750667", "6304492952", "0788809806", "6302642493", "6303439357", "6303123244", "B000035Z46", "B00016JF2W", "6304401736", "B00003CXXI", "B00004REYY", "B00005RDWC", "6304155972", "078880720X", "6302484359", "B00003CXG6", "080013558X", "6302409780", "B00005K9OA", "B00005RRG3", "6305177473", "6300276864", "B00006IUM9", "B00000G3AV"], "bought_together": ["155890641X", "6304401132"], "also_viewed": ["155890641X", "0788806270", "0788812408", "6303314015", "6304401132", "6302526574", "078881172X", "6302320402", "6302642248", "0788812807", "6304500831", "6300274268", "6302787068", "6304089767", "B000035Z2S", "6303983812", "0788805843", "6305229449", "6300274195", "6302961572", "B0000AQZYM", "6304400551", "6305940932", "0788805533", "6303929338", "6302178924", "6300275310", "B00005JKDQ", "6304290888", "6304100507", "6303534422", "6304978286", "6305319138", "6305326940", "6302158095", "B00003CX7L", "B0007KTBIU", "B00003CXQX", "B00005JL95", "B00005RDVV", "6304400225", "B00004R99N", "6304501153", "B00003CXHR", "B00005T7H6", "6303036813", "6304737491", "6304089201", "B00004R99I", "6302426200", "6301991311", "B000JBWWRO", "B000035Z46", "0788812440", "B00003CXCQ", "B00006CXK5", "B0000E32WB", "6304401736"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 49761}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.99, "brand": "The Walt Disney Company.", "asin": "0788802194", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JRS7PR6VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cinderella (Walt Disney's Masterpiece) [VHS]"}

Ariel can only succeed if she receives true love's kiss in a few day's time and she needs all the help she can from a singing crab named Sebastian, a loudmouth seagull, and a flounder.

Offbeat characters, weird narrative twists, and a tart  mixture of laughs and catastrophe--this is the juice that fuels such flicks asProof,The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,Strictly Ballroom,Heavenly Creatures, and most certainlyMuriel's Wedding. Directed by P.J.  Hogan (who would go on to helm the Hollywood hitMy Best Friend's Wedding),  this little gem follows tradition by featuring an authentic misfit: Muriel  (Toni Collette), a great overweight horse of a girl obsessed with getting  married and the music of ABBA. Appropriately, we first meet Muriel at a  wedding, all trussed up in a leopardskin number she's boosted for the  occasion. When her snotty peers insist that she give up the bridal bouquet to  someone who might actually get hitched, when one of the guests turns out to be a clerk in the very store where Muriel ripped off her outfit--you gotta  laugh, she's such an unmitigated mess. A loser, her philandering politician father (Bill Hunter) calls her--along with his doormat wife and his other  couch-potato offspring. But this movie's no exercise in geek-bashing. As  Muriel takes up with feisty Rhonda (Rachel Griffiths) and moves from Porpoise  Spit to the big city, her good-hearted grin and zest for life draw us in  despite hilarious gaffes and mishaps. (Making out with a boy for the first  time, Muriel suddenly finds herself awash in styrofoam: the oaf has unzipped  the beanbag chair instead of her skin-tight leather pants.)Muriel's Weddingcovers territory Hollywood would banish from a comedy--Rhonda's cancer, the  suicide of Muriel's mother, a marriage of convenience to an arrogant  athlete--yet, like its heroine, it never loses its sense of humor, its will to move on to whatever good thing might happen next. Everyone in the  idiosyncratic cast is terrific, but it's Toni Collette's Dancing Queen who  makesMuriel's Weddinga cinematic celebration you won't forget.--Kathleen  Murphy", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SIPAJG", "B00001U0DW", "B001CDR1F6", "0792843983", "B0000714BP", "B004VJJGFG", "B00BXL249K", "B00005JN1K", "B000089794", "B00006FMUW", "6305428425", "B000CCBCAS", "B00005JNC5", "B00003CXPD", "0792833198", "B0001HAGRE", "B000CCW2P2", "B00EPH8SBM", "B0045HCJGW", "B008NNY8TK", "B00BTYJYR6", "B001GKJ2DY", "0767827740", "B00A33J8YS", "B00CMQIDKY", "B00005JLD4", "B00DW5IJR6", "B003EYVXQ4", "B007UW9W5U", "B000002GLW", "B000ETRCN0", "B00005ALS0", "B00BAYLS1K", "B0001L3LUO", "B00AEFYNG8", "B00006AW0I", "6305283516", "B004XVMCQ2", "6305882592", "B000001DZO", "B000EHRVOW", "B001PPGAIA", "B004U7MR4G", "B0016MJ6T2", "B000087F7Q", "B000023VTP", "B00001W9G0", "B000AYYVME", "B0000542C7", "B00005N5SA", "B008LFYZAM", "B001DB6J6Y", "B00KNALRZ4", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00003CY5G", "B00005K3NU", "B0011FDVD6", "B00006ZXSL", "B00004TWZH", "B004D45NYC", "B00005JL7Q", "B000FO0AA6", "B000J103OI", "B005EVJCOA", "B00004VVMZ", "B00DL46ZN8", "B0045HCJRG", "0783225482", "B000068V9U", "B0001WPQJ2", "B00005JKGK", "B000063ING", "B007UW9W32", "B000092T3P", "B000765IJK", "B000069HZP", "B00AEFY4TO", "B000035Z5H", "B00005JNDZ", "0857687247", "B000NA1WDQ", "B004SIP9VA", "B000ELJAEM", "B0007IO6NM", "6304696558", "B004XVMCMG", "B0021L8UOY", "B00AEFY4CG", "B002GHHHJC", "B0053TWVQ4", "B001C47ZOW", "B0043X1FOU", "B009B1EPQ4", "B0000A02Y4", "B00008R9KD", "B0064MT1FI", "B0001I55M4", "6305622914", "B00CPIXOEY"], "bought_together": ["B004SIPAJG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0792843983", "B0000714BP", "0792833198", "B00EPH8SBM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 57288}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.99, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "0788814958", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/7176GF4V61L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Muriel's Wedding"}

{"description": "Martin Scorsese's 1990 masterpieceGoodFellasimmortalizes the hilarious, horrifying life of actual gangster Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), from his teen years on the streets of New York to his anonymous exile under the Witness Protection Program. The director's kinetic style is perfect for recounting Hill's ruthless rise to power in the 1950s as well as his drugged-out fall in the late 1970s; in fact, no one has ever rendered the mental dislocation of cocaine better than Scorsese. Scorsese uses period music perfectly, not just to summon a particular time but to set a precise mood.GoodFellasis at least as good asThe Godfatherwithout being in the least derivative of it. Joe Pesci's psycho improvisation of Mobster Tommy DeVito ignited Pesci as a star, Lorraine Bracco scores the performance of her life as the love of Hill's life, and every supporting role, from Paul Sorvino to Robert De Niro, is a miracle.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000C20VPA", "B000C20VRS", "B008R65XYC", "B000M341QE", "B0018CMJSU", "B0019L770A", "B0019L21GA", "B00004XPPB", "B000P0J0AG", "B0000DI87S", "B000P0J0EW", "B00003CXWV", "B00CCMKPO0", "B00G1C2URC", "B00004U103", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004SIP95G", "B002CPMB9O", "B0019L21H4", "B007TBIUSM", "B000286RP2", "B00011CZRE", "B004SIP8ZM", "B0006GAOJA", "B002T9H2LA", "B006TTC5HC", "B002VWNIEA", "0767830555", "B0000AMJEK", "B0000AM6JI", "B00005V9HH", "B004FQX5B6", "B000SFOW8I", "B00008975Z", "B002CA68N4", "6305313687", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00013RC2U", "0792174909", "B007D0FVRM", "B000A7DVR2", "B004G7XCRQ", "B002QEHPQU", "B003ASLJO0", "B000LP6KNU", "B000H5TH20", "B000P0J09C", "6305263248", "0783229526", "B00009W5CA", "B001C0I61M", "B000EHSVRI", "B00IEK9U0E", "B002ZG980U", "B004SIP7TE", "B004SIP7ZS", "B0006GAO5Y", "B00B0U2SFE", "B000ERVKBC", "B000A2UBN4", "B002AF4Y9G", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B0000714BS", "B000E5KQHI", "B00005JA8B", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B003AWRMCE", "B000P0J0EM", "1558908390", "B00080ZG10", "0767802519", "B003ELKNH2", "B003BV8I3Q", "B000035Z5G", "B00AEFXDO6", "B000E8NRBC", "B00000JGHV", "B00004RJ71", "B00AEBB9CS", "B004SIP93S", "B00AEFYSEA", "B004SIP6WW", "B003ASLJQS", "B0001Z4OXS", "B002VWNIDG", "0783225946", "B00AEBB9ZK", "B00AEFXXMI", "B0000A02TZ", "B000MZHW40", "B004SIP6GI", "B002ZG99N6", "B00AEBB95K", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00BB67UNW", "B00029RTAI", "B000P0J0D8", "B003ASLJOU", "B000Z8GZYW", "B003ASLJS6"], "bought_together": ["B000C20VPA", "B000C20VRS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000M341QE", "B0018CMJSU", "B000P0J0EW", "B00BCB1JJW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 120285}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.49, "brand": "WARNER STUDIOS", "asin": "0790729725", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YHNBJW24L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "GoodFellas"}

{"description": "Stanley Kubrick'sThe Shiningis less an adaptation of Stephen King's bestselling horror novel than a complete reimagining of it from the inside out. In King's book, the Overlook Hotel is a haunted place that takes possession of its off-season caretaker and provokes him to murderous rage against his wife and young son. Kubrick's movie is an existential Road Runner cartoon (his steadicam scurrying through the hotel's labyrinthine hallways), in which the cavernously empty spaces inside the Overlook mirror the emptiness in the soul of the blocked writer, who's settled in for a long winter's hibernation. As many have pointed out, King's protagonist goes mad, but Kubrick's Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is Looney Tunes from the moment we meet him--all arching eyebrows and mischievous grin. (Both Nicholson and Shelley Duvall reach new levels of hysteria in their performances, driven to extremes by the director's fanatical demands for take after take after take.)The Shiningis terrifying--but not in the way fans of the novel might expect. When it was redone as a TV miniseries (reportedly because of King's dissatisfaction with the Kubrick film), the famous topiary-animal attack (which was deemed impossible to film in 1980) was there--but the deeper horror was lost. Kubrick'sThe Shininggets under your skin and chills your bones; it stays with you, inhabits you, haunts you. And there's no place to hide...--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300267881", "0790734079", "B00005ATQA", "6302038308", "6300182770", "B0009RRUKW", "0783235607", "0783228317", "B00000J2KZ", "B00004RNAC", "0790736039", "B00023NRSM", "6304508611", "6300182878", "6302921058", "6304509154", "0783216084", "6300214087", "B00004W5UA", "6301427076", "630268644X", "B000003KHS", "B000AMW2TK", "0790700506", "6300181340", "6300214753", "6302054982", "0784011923", "6305363668", "6303686796", "6305095566", "630021639X", "6302822688", "6305576173", "0783246641", "6304994540", "6303953425", "B00004U8PA", "0792158261", "0792100085", "6300213986", "6300189015", "630533577X", "6300214826", "0792846303", "6304288433", "6300147630", "0792842111", "B000007OY0", "0790741512", "6302158176", "0792846311", "6300183416", "0800103106", "B000005PFL", "6300183211", "0790733927", "6301666569", "6301871952", "0767825411", "630339406X", "6303109950", "6300216500", "6300214192", "6300262731", "6303257674", "6304214502", "630018627X", "6300214311", "1558807381", "0792839234", "0767819187", "B00005B238", "0790731975", "6303579388", "B000059HFB", "6302798450", "B00000FZCU", "6303651461", "6303566391", "6302642175", "6301971582", "6300218058", "6301094352", "6300184064", "6300181278", "6304457383", "6300214672", "6300262855", "0800125762", "6303257305"], "bought_together": ["0790734079"], "also_viewed": ["6300147630", "6300182878", "B00005ATQA", "6300189015", "6300267881", "B00023NRSM", "6300213005", "6303953425", "0307743659", "6303148352", "0790734079", "B001AQT0Z4", "6300183211", "0784011923", "B00BBND56G", "0788806270"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 268792}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0790705141", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5106FV0S4PL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Shining [VHS]"}
{"description": "Terry George, the cowriter ofIn the Name of the Father, wrote and directed this 1996 drama based on actual events from 1981, when Irish Republican Army prisoners in Belfast's Maze Prison staged a hunger strike to protest against British prime minister Margaret Thatcher's political policies. Led by IRA prisoner Bobby Sands, the hunger strike eventually lead to the deaths of 10 prisoners, who had refused to wear prison uniforms to emphasize their identity as political (and not criminal) prisoners. But this fictionalized account is not about the hunger strikers as much as the moral dilemma faced by two of the strikers' mothers, played by Helen Mirren and Fionnula Flanagan in an emotional drama that gets right to the heart of the \"Troubles\" in Northern Ireland. While Annie (Flanagan) understands her son's political motivations and supports his readiness to die, Kathleen (Mirren) is a pacifist who cannot comprehend how any mother could sacrifice her own son to a political principle. The women become friends despite their opposing views, and desperately hope for a compromise in Irish-British negotiations while the hunger strikers continue to wither away. By keeping the Northern Irish conflict on such a purely personal level,Some Mother's Sonboth clarifies and complicates the difficult issues involved, making clear arguments for both mothers' actions in the context of a milestone event in Northern Ireland's history. The film doesn't pretend to hide its anti-British position, but the cause of death on both sides is deeply acknowledged. Through Helen Mirren's richly layered performance,Some Mother's Sonasks if any belief is truly worth dying for, and poses the question on powerfully personal terms.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_viewed": ["6303954294", "B007UW9W5U"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 356188}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.05, "brand": "", "asin": "0790731142", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DYZPS4C6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Some Mother's Son [VHS]"}
{"description": "The satirical sensibilities of writer Peter Shaffer and director Milos Forman (One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest) were ideally matched in this Oscar-winning movie adaptation of Shaffer's hit play about the rivalry between two composers in the court of Austrian Emperor Joseph II--official royal composer Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), and the younger but superior prodigy Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce). The conceit is absolutely delicious: Salieri secretly loathes Mozart's crude and bratty personality, but is astounded by the beauty of his music. That's the heart of Salieri's torment--although he's in a unique position to recognize and cultivate both Mozart's talent and career, he's also consumed with envy and insecurity in the face of such genius. That such magnificent music should come from such a vulgar little creature strikes Salieri as one of God's cruelest jokes, and it drives him insane.Amadeuscreates peculiar and delightful contrasts between the impeccably re-created details of its lavish period setting and the jarring (but humorously refreshing and unstuffy) modern tone of its dialogue and performances--all of which serve to remind us that these were people before they became enshrined in historical and artistic legend. Jeffrey Jones, best-known as Ferris Bueller's principal, is particularly wonderful as the bumbling emperor (with the voice of a modern midlevel businessman). The film's eight Oscars include statuettes for Best Director Forman, Best Actor Abraham (Hulce was also nominated), Best Screenplay, and Best Picture.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305261296", "B00000K3AN", "6305470448", "6302250269", "0800132009", "0790743213", "B000067JAU", "6304071876"], "bought_together": ["6305261296"], "also_viewed": ["6303168507"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 287790}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.88, "brand": "", "asin": "0790734060", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512Y1EHFXCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Amadeus [VHS]"}
{"description": "What is it about director Richard Donner that Mel Gibson enjoys so much that he's appeared in five of Donner's films? Is it the on-set pranks? Could it be the big-budget perks and $20-million paychecks? Or is it just a well-stocked catering table? Whatever the case, theLethal Weaponstar and director teamed up again, along with fellow superstar Julia Roberts, for this typically glossy, entertaining but ultimately hokey thriller. Gibson plays New York cab driver Jerry Fletcher, whose wacky belief in conspiracies finally hits on a coincidental truth involving an evil figure named Jonas (Patrick Stewart) and a secret program of government-funded mind control. Roberts plays the Justice Department attorney who finally believes in Jerry's paranoid ramblings. With a plot (fromLA.

{"description": "Writer and director Whit Stillman (Metropolitan,The Last Days  of Disco) offers up this poignant and cutting romantic 1990 comedy set in the magical southern Spanish metropolis, a city in the midst of cultural and political upheaval. Taylor Nichols (Metropolitan) plays an American living in the Catalonian capital working for a stateside company. He is visited by his unctuous cousin (Chris Eigeman), a naval attach&#xE9; who's in Barcelona to spin a little public relations for the impending arrival of the U.S. fleet amid some virulent left-wing, anti-American attitude. The two cousins are constantly at odds, arguing about everything from politics to women to their true feelings for one another and their constant self-examination. Largely the two men spend their time in search of romance abroad, as they humorously overanalyze the women they meet and what they want from a relationship, until fate takes a shocking turn and both men are forced to reevaluate who they are and what they want out of life.Barcelonafeatures a turn from Mira Sorvino (Mighty Aphrodite) as a Spanish national working as a hostess, free with her sexuality and smitten with Eigeman. Stillman's writing is as crisp and observant as his striking visual take on the city and its people, both natives and expatriates. Barcelona is a terrific comedy of attitudes and culture clashes that manages to be offbeat, sardonic, and unexpectedly wise.--Robert Lane", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305128960", "6303995713"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 437104}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.24, "brand": "", "asin": "0790731150", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EFY1ZANVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Barcelona [VHS]"}

It's 2013 and L.A. is now an island maximum security prison off the coast of California. Snake has 10 hours to find a doomsday weapon that's fallen into the hands of revolutionaries before he dies of a virus with which he's been injected. But the action is clumsy and unimaginative: lots of shootouts and very little suspense. Even the bad guys aren't particularly inventive; only Pam Grier, as a transsexual gang leader, strikes any sparks.

{"description": "What a combo! Tobe Hooper, the director ofThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre, teamed up with family-oriented producer Steven Spielberg to makePoltergeist. The film is about a haunted suburban tract home in a development very much like the Arizona one in which Spielberg was raised. (Because it came out the same summer as Spielberg'sE.T., it was tempting to see both movies as representing Spielberg's ambivalent feelings about childhood in suburbia. One was a fantasy, the other a nightmare.)  Spielberg also cowrote the screenplay, which taps into primal, childlike fears of monsters under the bed, monsters in the closet, sinister clown faces, and all manner of things that go bump in the night. At first, some of the odd happenings in the house are kind of funny and amusing, but they grow gradually creepier until the film climaxes in a terrifying special-effects extravaganza when 5-year-old Carole Anne (Heather O'Rourke) is kidnapped by the spooks and held hostage in another dimension. Though not nearly as frightening as Hooper's magnum opus, or the originalA Nightmare on Elm Street, which came along two years later,Poltergeistis one of the smartest and most entertaining horror pictures of its time.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00009PY4G", "B00006FDCD", "B00AEFYYH6", "B007STBUHI", "B004SIP92O", "B00004BZIY", "B000VECAD0", "B00000IQC4", "B00005A8XX", "B004LWZW24", "B001B1872U", "B009XTF8KQ", "B00386EZUY", "B000HCO86I", "B00005JOJE", "B0087F7VSY", "B001D2WU9I", "B000PMLJMQ", "B000067FP8", "B000E1P2EY", "B003PIUINI", "B0009X763M", "B000WC3864", "B003UN0752", "B002I41KNC", "B0021L8UFI", "B005GT3X68", "B000P0J0A6", "B0087ZG7PW", "B00AIBZLVY", "B0045HCJJE", "B000ASATZ8", "B0000VCZK2", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00005JNTI", "B000E33W1W", "B00008LUNW", "B00AEBBA2W", "B000CCBC9O", "B0006SGYL0", "B000FAOC2W", "B00008WFU4", "B000OA8OK4", "B00005JNNT", "B001AGXEAG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004TDTO", "B00004BZIY", "B000VECAD0", "B00006FDCD"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 69740}, "asin": "0792833201", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31ZsC3YTJ5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Poltergeist"}
{"description": "When it was released during Hollywood's golden year of 1939,The Wizard of Ozdidn't start out as the perennial classic it has since become. The film did respectable business, but it wasn't until its debut on television that this family favorite saw its popularity soar. And whileOz's TV broadcasts are now controlled by media mogul Ted Turner (who owns the rights), the advent of home video has made this lively musical a mainstay in the staple diet of great American films. Young Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland), her dog, Toto, and her three companions on the Yellow Brick Road to Oz--the Tin Man (Jack Haley), the Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr), and the Scarecrow (Ray Bolger)--have become pop-culture icons and central figures in the legacy of fantasy for children. As the Wicked Witch who covets Dorothy's enchanted ruby slippers, Margaret Hamilton has had the singular honor of scaring the wits out of children for more than six decades. The film's still as fresh, frightening, and funny as it was when first released. It may take some liberal detours from the original story by L. Frank Baum, but it's loyal to the Baum legacy while charting its own course as a spectacular film. Shot in glorious Technicolor, befitting its dynamic production design (Munchkinland alone is a psychedelic explosion of color and d&eacute;cor),The Wizard of Ozmay not appeal to every taste as the years go by, but it's required viewing for kids of all ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005F96UJ6", "B0000VCZKM", "B00E9ZATKI", "0792839749", "B0087F7VSY", "B0090XLDKY", "B002M2Z3BA", "076781326X", "B00C7JGDBW", "B000P0J09W", "B000URDCC6", "B002HK9IDQ", "B0000DZ3EN", "B000RPCK2E", "B000065V42", "B001JV5BF8", "B0000AM6IY", "B00335EQ0E", "B005NFJAZS", "B003VS0CX8", "B0000VCZKW", "0062278010", "B002NZK5SW", "B0010X744G", "B00CQRN3QI", "B0009XT8ME", "B000HT3PGU", "B006VJ1AAI", "B00005RRG7", "B008H6GHEM", "B00GVFJ5QS", "B00HVBB140", "B002VWNIAY", "B000BT970O", "B002CLBJPK", "0060293233", "B00028HBES", "B00322XV8Q", "B00EV1YZ96", "B000AJJNIG", "B00AATV0WS", "B0054OGQM8", "1495421864", "0739060821", "B00AEFXMGU", "0792833759", "B00AMSQBNK", "B000TPTCP0", "B0009X75QU", "B00ITVMMOY", "B00005RRGB", "B0017Q0SJ4", "0767836324", "B004302N2Q", "084318017X", "B001GLX6UI", "B003YBW2Y4", "1402766254", "B00019GHU2", "B00003CXCQ", "B00AMSM9CW", "B00005JG6M", "B0047QLNUY", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B00447L4JG", "0767819659", "B00000JPH6", "B002BIGCXS", "B00G5G7EXY", "B0000AK7AB", "B006FE83UE", "B002VWNIBI", "B00005JL1P", "B001ILFUDC", "0800177258", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00005RDSQ", "B00JHH1ZN8", "B0006IINYQ", "B0015NORDW", "B002GHHHNS", "B0013ND30M", "0792838408", "B001AGXEAG", "B0047CG9F2", "B00006ADD5", "B0013FSL3E", "B00079Z9VO", "B00F6SHECS", "B0008JIJ2E", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00005JN4W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HVBB140", "B005F96UJ6", "B0000VCZKM", "B00I6JOD2S"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 206236}, "asin": "0792833171", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GYW80GAJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Wizard of Oz"}

{"description": "A movie's lasting value can often be measured by its influence in the  years and  decades following its original release, and on that basisRun Silent, Run Deepis certainly a classic of sorts. It remains one of the seminal World War&nbsp;II submarine  pictures, and its intelligent script and tautly executed action are clearly echoed in such  later submarine dramas asDas Bootand especiallyCrimson Tide,  which borrows liberally from this 1958 film.In one of his best and final roles (he appeared in only four films after this), Clark Gable plays a submarine captain without a command, having been saddled  with a desk job after his previous ship was destroyed due to his overzealous pursuit  of the enemy in dangerous Japanese waters. He finally gets another boat--this time  with a vigilant first officer (Burt Lancaster), who stands poised to assume command if  Gable puts his crew in unnecessary danger. The tension and mutual respect between  these two principled men is superbly written and directed (Robert Wise was just two  years away from his triumph withWest Side Story), and the crucial inclusion  of a strong supporting cast (including Jack Warden and Don Rickles) enhances the  movie's compelling authenticity. Based on a novel by former submarine commander  Edward&nbsp;L. Beach,Run Silent, Run Deepis rousing entertainment with the  added benefit of paying honorable tribute to the men who navigated through the most  frightening and claustrophobic channels of the Pacific theater.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001NBMH6", "B0001WTWWE", "B00005JN9P", "B0001NBMGC", "B000E5N6KW", "B00008AOTR", "B000NTPG6Q", "B000NO1XJA", "B0001FGC1U", "B00005N5S3", "B00AEFYBA6", "B004VGHF7K", "B000O599Z8", "B000O78L0U", "B00096S4B2", "B00096S4BM", "B0000AMRUP", "B00005PJ8K", "B004R6EF9U", "B005HQBO9I", "0767802470", "B00008AOTO", "0792841662", "B00AEFXLKC", "B0007TKNGA", "B0009XRZI8", "B0001NBMHQ", "B00003CXHJ", "B000EHSVSC", "B0015S2OWI", "B000NTPG5W", "B000EMGJFE", "B00005B1YF", "B00005B1YH", "B0038EG20W", "B000062XEX", "B00005OSJQ", "B000O599VC", "B00AEFYENK", "B000FZETR0", "B00005ASGB", "B004TPJN3C", "B00005PJ8L", "B0001FVDIC", "B0001NBMI0", "B00K6J7Q1Q", "B00005PJ8S", "B00008DDGW", "B004GSVXBW", "B00008V6Y1", "B004176JJY", "B003AWRMCO", "B00004XPPC", "B0002TSZHY", "B0006B2A42", "B000MGTQ7K", "B00008MTY1", "6304765258", "0782010040", "B00008R9M6", "0792839730", "B000A2WJBQ", "B000H1RFSM", "B000MGTQ7U", "B00008K76U", "B0005C9MQ6", "B000U1ZV6M", "B0007TKNLU", "B000NTPG5M", "B00IJZW3QW", "B00008R9M5", "B00CHYSSME", "B000EHSVS2", "B000CNESN0", "B00BFWKE62", "B000MGBLIC", "B00143XE0U", "0792838408", "B00005N5S2", "B00008AOTM", "B0029778T8", "B000O599N0", "B0001FVDH8", "B004QSQMPE", "B00E8G5HZ0", "B000E0WJN2", "B004U7EIES", "B00BX8PG4S", "B003B3NV5E", "B0002S94G6", "0792843576", "B000EHSVV4", "B000F7CMQ8", "B005DTZXPA", "B000O78L00", "B0009ML2JC", "0792844017", "B004IFYMXE", "B0014CCPP6", "B002GHHHPQ"], "bought_together": ["B0001NBMH6", "B0001WTWWE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0045HCJSA", "B00005N90X", "B0012YYZTK", "B00097DY2A"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 25761}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 25.0, "brand": "GABLE/LANCASTER", "asin": "0792841670", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71FX265SKNL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Run Silent, Run Deep"}

The guy they finally choose doesn't last long--they find him dead from a drug overdose along with a suitcase full of money that he no longer needs. They decide to keep the money; this of course requires that they discreetly dispose of the body, which proves to be a gruesome, traumatic business. They begin to suspect each other of betrayal and become increasingly deranged.

{"description": "Far too many film versions of theThe Four Feathershave been made over the years, which is especially surprising considering that this 1939 Korda brothers production is surely definitive. The film simultaneously celebrates and pokes fun at British imperialism, showing the kind of dogged stiff-upper-lippery that forged an Empire, but also the blinkered attitudes and crass snobbishness of the ruling classes (and those accents--did people ever really talk like that?). Whatever political subtext may or may not be read into it, though, the film is best celebrated for its magnificent vistas: partially made on location in the Sudan, as well as at the famous Denham Studios, this is British cinema from the days when it thought to rival Hollywood for sheer spectacle. Vincent Korda's production design and the glorious early color cinematography are helped greatly by fellow Hungarian &#xE9;migr&#xE9; Miklos Rozsa's epic score.John Clements is the notional hero, the man who determines to show the world that he is not a coward after resigning his commission (even though it would surely have saved everyone a lot of bother if he had just stuck with it) but the film is stolen by Ralph Richardson, magnificent as an officer struck blind and led to safety by Clements' Harry Faversham. The later scenes when Richardson's Capt. Durrance realizes the truth and its implications are the most poignant and emotionally truthful in the film. C. Aubrey Smith is delightful as the old buffer who relives his battles on the dinner table; to a modern audience, however, the \"blackface\" casting of John Laurie as the Khalifa strikes a discordant note. But adjusting some expectations for its vintage, this is a triumph of derring-do and far and away the most gripping version of this oft-told story on film.--Mark Walker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00049QQJQ", "6304457316", "B00005JLO2", "B00006ADD5", "B002VWNIAY", "1558807780", "6301969049", "6303020089"], "also_viewed": ["B00006BSDL"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 392072}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.88, "brand": "", "asin": "0792844602", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RHY100E9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Four Feathers [VHS]"}

{"description": "Winner of five Academy Awards including Best Picture, Actor, and Screenplay,Kramer vs. Kramerremains as powerfully moving today as it was when released in 1979, simply because its drama will remain relevant for couples of any generation. Adapted by director Robert Benton from the novel by Avery Corman, this is perhaps the finest, most evenly balanced film ever made about the failure of marriage and the tumultuous shift of parental roles. It begins when Joanna Kramer (Meryl Streep) bluntly informs her husband Ted (Dustin Hoffman) that she's leaving him, just as his advertising career is advancing and demanding most of his waking hours. Self-involvement is just one of the film's underlying themes, along with the search for identity that prompts Joanna to leave Ted with their first-grade son (Justin Henry), who now finds himself living with a workaholic parent he barely knows. Juggling his domestic challenge with professional deadlines, Ted is further pressured when his wife files for custody of their son. This legal battle forms the dramatic spine of the film, but its power is derived from Benton's flawlessly observant script and the superlative performances of his entire cast. Because Benton refuses to assign blame and deals fairly with both sides of a devastating dilemma, the film arrives at equal levels of pain, growth, and integrity under emotionally stressful circumstances. That gives virtually every scene the unmistakable ring of truth--a quality of dramatic honestly that makesKramer vs. Kramernot merely a classic tearjerker, but one of the finest American dramas of its decade.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["630273973X", "0783240171", "B00005NQGQ", "B00AEBB95K", "6301627091", "6300182304", "0792835018", "B004IFIMT4", "6301247485", "6304935811"], "bought_together": ["630273973X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 256640}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0800106032", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J3PVCJM3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Kramer vs. Kramer [VHS]"}

{"description": "Arguably the greatest black comedy ever made, Stanley Kubrick's cold-war classic is the ultimate satire of the nuclear age.Dr. Strangeloveis a perfect spoof of political and military insanity, beginning when General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden), a maniacal warrior obsessed with &quot;the purity of precious bodily fluids,&quot; mounts his singular campaign against Communism by ordering a squadron of B-52 bombers to attack the Soviet Union. The Soviets counter the threat with a so- called &quot;Doomsday Device,&quot; and the world hangs in the balance while the U.S. president (Peter Sellers) engages in hilarious hot-line negotiations with his Soviet counterpart. Sellers also plays a British military attach&eacute; and the mad bomb-maker Dr. Strangelove; George C. Scott is outrageously frantic as General Buck Turgidson, whose presidential advice consists mainly of panic and statistics about &quot;acceptable losses.&quot; With dialogue (&quot;You can't fight here! This is the war room!&quot;) and images (Slim Pickens's character riding the bomb to oblivion) that have become a part of our cultural vocabulary, Kubrick's film regularly appears on critics' lists of the all-time best.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004XPPE", "B001IHJ988", "B004L9GMBC", "B00009MEKJ", "0792841409", "B000UJ48SQ", "B000UJ48VI", "B0009S4J3C", "B0009S4J3M", "B0000AMRUP", "B000NTPG7K", "B0045HCJ9O", "B000M53GMC", "B00020X88Y", "B001LXIDUY", "B00005J760", "B000CEXEWA", "B00004RF83", "B00006ADD5", "B000Q66J1M", "B00871C09S", "B0009IW8OE", "B003NTUOGU", "B002VWNIAY", "B0010YSD7W", "0783226039", "B00005JKH9", "B0050FXDDQ", "B005152C9G", "B004UOHNAC", "B000EHSVS2", "B00005AUKE", "B00005A06N", "B009GXTFNK", "B000CEXFC4", "B0049985XW", "B004GJYRI2", "B000G6BLWE", "B001GLX6UI", "B0013FSXT6", "B0001AG01M", "B0045HCJ9E", "B00079Z9VO", "B000C20VNM", "B0087ZG7OI", "B000KX0IOA", "B000MGTQ7K", "B008RO875Q", "B00824FK9W", "B0000DJZ8R", "B00003CXB5", "B00005O3VC", "6305882592", "0780022343", "B0000AUHPB", "B00021R7CG", "B00AEFXDO6", "B00005JNZU", "B00AEBB89C", "B000V7HFL4", "B00005JL0I", "B000E1NXJ0", "B0087ZG7R0", "B00006LPGP", "B007Y1NR1W", "B00005QAPH", "B001BSBBNK", "B00007G1WH"], "bought_together": ["B00004XPPE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004L9GMBC", "B001DJLCPE", "B000UJ48SQ", "B00GGAK0FS"]}, "price": 15.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 44560}, "asin": "0800141709", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FXW5TZZ8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dr. Strangelove: Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"}
{"description": "IfBuffy the Vampire Slayerrepresents the lighter side of high school as a macabre experience, here's a movie that asks the burning question, &quot;What happens when angst-ridden teenagers develop supernatural powers?&quot; More to the point, how do four outcast teenaged witches handle their ability to cast wicked spells on the taunting classmates who've nicknamed them &quot;The Bitches of Eastwick&quot;? The answer, of course, is &quot;don't get mad, get even.&quot; That's about all there is to this terminally silly movie, which makes up for its ludicrous plot by letting its young female cast have a field day as they indulge their dark fantasies. Fairuza Balk is enjoyable as the most wicked of the witches, and is therefore the focus of the film's most dazzling special effects. But it's Neve Campbell from television'sParty of Fivewho made this film a modest box-office hit, just before she became her generation's fright-movie favorite inScreamand its popular sequel.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002NZK5V4", "B00441GYVK", "B000FFJYBG", "B000K4WPCC", "6305428042", "078322933X", "B00001PE4D", "B0053TWVQ4", "B002O3Z4VG", "1567184464", "6305428425", "B004P7CN7W", "B004SIP9MY", "B002GOAH10", "B000A5045Q", "B003HKN52U", "B00447L4KA", "B0012GN2XI", "B00094ARJ6", "0783225482", "B000056T5E", "B00003CXMP", "B002XUBDRY", "B00002SSKI", "B00DW5IKYS", "B000BYA5HS", "6305821216", "B001AGXEAG", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B00005J761", "B004LWZW2O", "B005CFBYW6", "B00005JKJS", "B0000524E5", "B00003CWQR", "B000083C6I", "B00AJCUL2G", "B000069I1I", "B000A2X3U2", "B00A2H9L2E", "B0000714BP", "B0009MWEM6", "B00000IQW4", "B004SUDQ1I", "B00027JZ3E", "0767824954", "B000HD1482", "B00005JNY3", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00013RC2K", "1558908315", "B00JPQ1HX4", "B00005RHGK", "B00009WVSL", "B000GCFO0I", "B0016MJ6T2", "B00AEFYM2S", "B00001QGUM", "B00004RF85", "0792840127", "B0021L8UPS", "B00004Z4WR", "B00005JLH0", "0767808673", "B00005K3NR", "B00BSU0FQA", "B0001GF2D8", "B00000F0AD", "0767837398", "B00003CXPS", "B000021Y7E", "B000V4UFZK", "B000BX0VT6", "B002USF1WC", "B004SIP9O2", "6305428271", "B000AM4P9K", "6305065551", "B003VA3JUO", "B0036TGSIK", "B00441GYVA", "B000GYI3B8", "B0041KKYEM", "B00DMDE02Q", "B004SEUJ9Q", "B0000AC8LI", "B000RIWAVW", "B000HC2M0C", "B0001EFV7M", "B00000G3PA", "B007I6JZVE", "B00013RC7K", "B002VWNIDG", "B00AEFXPG2", "B000K7VHLY", "B000FGGE68", "B000H5TH0W", "B00AMEZDJW", "B009AMAGQM", "B0085A9HU6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002NZK5V4", "6305428425", "B00441GYVK", "B00447L4KA"]}, "price": 4.85, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 244555}, "asin": "0800141644", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HC5C2JHDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Craft"}

{"description": "WithMo' Better Blues, the story of a young trumpeter's rise to jazz-world stardom, Spike Lee set out to counter Clint Eastwood's clich&eacute;-ridden biopic of Charlie Parker inBird. But the final product, a slick, glossy drama (with hip-hop jazz provided by Gangstarr no less), is just as superficial as the numerous Alger-esque stories of music stardom to which movie audiences are accustomed.Denzel Washington gives a typically charismatic performance as the trumpeter in question, as does Wesley Snipes as his sax-playing rival. And as with most Spike Lee films, there are numerous solid performers in small roles such as Bill Nunn, Latin-music star Rub&eacute;n Blades, and comedian Robin Harris. One character, however, attracted unwanted attention: John Turturro's role as an unscrupulous music-industry exec. Critics called the Turturro character, who is at once money hungry, swarthy, and perpetually shrouded in darkness, a classic anti-Semitic caricature. But the charge seems almost irrelevant in Spike Lee's cartoonish, overstylized world of impossibly hunky jazzmen, curvaceous hangers-on, and incessant bebop.--Ethan Brown", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 512696}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "", "asin": "1558801871", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51121XWTH5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mo Better Blues [VHS]"}

{"description": "Perhaps only the collective brilliant minds of the Monty Python film and television troupe are up to the task of tackling a subject as weighty as the Meaning of Life. Sure, Kierkegaard, Wittgenstein, and their ilk have tried their hands at this puzzler, but only Python has attempted to do so within the commercial motion picture medium. Happily for us all,Monty Python's the Meaning of Lifetruly explains everything one conceivably needs to know about the perplexities of human existence, from the mysteries of Catholic doctrine to the miracle of reproduction to why one should avoid the salmon mousse to the critical importance of the machine that goesping!Using fish as a linking device (and what marvelous links those aquatic creatures make),The Meaning of Lifeis presented as a series of sketches: a musical production number about why seed is sacred; a look at dining in the afterlife; the quest for a missing fish (there they are again); a visit from Mr. Death; the cautionary tale of Mr. Creosote and his rather gluttonous appetite; an unflinching examination of the harsh realities of organ donation, and so on. Sadly, this was the last original Python film, but it's a beaut. You'll laugh. You'll cry (probably because you're laughing so hard). You may even learn something about the Meaning of Life. Or at least about how fish fit into the grand scheme of things.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302293553", "6304626495"], "bought_together": ["6302293553", "6304626495"], "also_viewed": ["B000VE439Y", "B0009XRZ92"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 412653}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "", "asin": "1558806768", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5150E8ZRS1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Monty Python's The Meaning of Life [VHS]"}
{"description": "From a match made in heaven comes a movie spawned in hell! Young hotshot director Robert Rodriquez (El Mariachi,Desperado) teamed up withPulp Fictionauteur Quentin Tarantino (offering his services as writer and co-star) to make this outrageous, no-holds-barred hybrid of high-octane crime and gruesome horror. QT plays Richard Gecko, a borderline psychopath who breaks his career-criminal brother, Seth (George Clooney), out of prison, after which they rob a bank and leave a trail of dead and wounded in their bloody wake. Then they hijack a mobile home driven by a former Baptist minister (Harvey Keitel) who quit the church after his wife's death and hit the road with his two children (played by Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu). Heading to Mexico with their hostages, the infamous Gecko brothers arrive at the Titty Twister bar to rendezvous for a money drop, but they don't realize that they've just entered the nocturnal lair of a bloodthirsty gang of vampires! With not-so-subtle aplomb, Rodriguez and Tarantino shift into high gear with a nonstop parade of gore, gunfire, and pointy-fanged mayhem featuring Salma Hayek as a snake-charming dancer whose bite is much worse than her bark. If you're a fan of Tarantino's lyrical dialogue and pop-cultural wit, you'll have fun with the road-movie half of this supernatural horror-comedy, but if your taste runs more to exploding heads and eyeballs, sloppy entrails and morphing monsters, the second half provides a connoisseur's feast of gross-out excess.Bon app&eacute;tit!--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002AF4Y9G", "B000UAE7O0", "B000R7HY0K", "B004U7MR14", "B000P0J0D8", "6305327041", "B0000A2ZU1", "B004SIP9Z6", "B004SIP95G", "B002T9H2LA", "B00008975Z", "B007D5E7C2", "B002ZG98C8", "B0000WN140", "B007D0FVRM", "B005LAIIJY", "6305428468", "B00005JMUA", "B0045DO81U", "B00005JMEW", "630569270X", "B0009A40ES", "B001VLBDD0", "B0000A2ZTY", "B003Y8YB3C", "B0031P77RU", "B00027JZ3E", "B00070FX5U", "B000ASDFI6", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00004Y87O", "B000A2UBN4", "B000OVLBHG", "B00005O5AY", "B00011CZRE", "B000K7VHNW", "B000093FLA", "B0024FADD8", "6305258287", "B000WC3864", "B003HKN52U", "B001CDFY50", "B000AXWHSA", "B00111YM5Q", "B000EHRVP6", "B002VWNIDG", "B000P0J09M", "0767811054", "B004P7CN7W", "B00005QJHP", "B00AEFYYWQ", "0767802519", "B00GDDNFDW", "0783229526", "B008CYDD7I", "B008LC8V1Y", "B0007DFJ0G", "B001KRVLCI", "B00005JKWJ", "B000RTB0R6", "0783229402", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B00003CXWV", "B00005JLRE", "B002U4UZSQ", "B000LP6KNU", "B00AKGG828", "B002WY65VU", "B005J9ZFQG", "6305594333", "B0007KZQAM", "B000C20VRS", "B000056PMU", "6304765258", "B00005N5S5", "B00006CXGP", "B003PIUINS", "6305065551", "B00005JA8B", "B0002ABURA", "B00001QGUM", "B003AWRMCE", "0800177789", "B000022TSY", "B003TRMLQM", "B00008RH3J", "B00AEFXESQ", "B0002KVULG", "B002GSXKNI", "B002JT69IW", "B0085A9HU6", "0780618548", "B000055Y0Y", "B004P7CMOQ", "B006CXIKYC", "0792846435", "B00AEBBADG", "B00AEFY5B6", "0767817664", "B00005V9HH"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004P7CMOQ", "B000UAE7O0", "B004SIP95G", "B004SIP9Z6"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 216353}, "asin": "1558908455", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517ESWW8VSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "From Dusk Till Dawn"}
{"description": "Hit man Martin Q. Blank (John Cusack) is in an awkward situation. Several of them, actually. He's attending his high school reunion on an assignment; he's got a rival hit man (Dan Aykroyd) on his tail; and he's going to have to explain to his old girlfriend (Minnie Driver) why he stood her up on prom night. This amiable black comedy, cowritten by Cusack and directed by Jonathan Demme prot&eacute;g&eacute; George Armitage (Miami Blues), has the feel of Demme'sSomething WildandMarried to the Mob--which is to say its humor is dark and brightly colored at the same time. Cusack and Driver are utterly charming--as is the leading man's sister, Joan, who plays his secretary. (Ms. Cusack received an Oscar nomination for her next role, inIn & Out.)

{"description": "Robert Bresson drew inspiration from Dostoevsky'sCrime and Punishmentfor this examination of an arrogant young pickpocket who deems himself above the laws and conditions of ordinary men. Michel (Martin LaSalle), a rather bland-looking young man with a perpetually blank face, haunts the subways, city streets, and racetracks to ply his trade. He plays a game of wits with a fatherly police inspector and walls his heart off from the affections of a quiet young woman, Jeanne (Marika Green), who looks after his dying mother. Bresson's direction of his \"models\" (as he calls his nonprofessional performers) strips them of affectation and motivation, making them blank slates defined by the accumulation of precisely drilled actions and words.Pickpocketis no thriller, though Bresson offers impressive, meticulously detailed scenes of daring and intimate robberies (one sequence on a subway feels like an homage to Sam Fuller'sPickup on South Street). Rather, it is a powerful, profound search for meaning and spiritual enlightenment by a man who believes in nothing but himself, and many critics consider it Bresson's masterpiece. Paul Schrader, whose bookTranscendental Cinemaoffers a detailed analysis of Bresson's work, has quoted the famous, emotionally restrained yet spiritually moving conclusion in two of his own films:American GigoloandLight Sleeper.--Sean Axmaker", "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 597369}, "asin": "1567301290", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21WTVB3RD3L.jpg", "title": "Pickpocket [VHS]"}
{"description": "\"I'm investigating when a man died of natural causes,\" states aristocratic sleuth Lord Peter Wimsey, \"but it's beginning to look more interesting everyday.\" So it is in this impeccably mounted 1972 BBC miniseries, which would make Dorothy L. Sayers's peerless literary creation proud.Ian Carmichael stars in his signature role as the stylish, cultured, and erudite Wimsey, whose investigation into the death of General Fentiman is as irresistible as \"poking sticks into a peaceful and mysterious-looking pond to see what was on the bottom.\" Fentiman died in his favorite chair at the staid Bellona Club. Oddly enough, his sister died the same day. Wimsey agrees to try and determine when Fentiman died (\"I shall enjoy it,\" he exults). In a nutshell, as one character states (which is always helpful in increasingly complicated cases like this), dispersion of the inheritance will become \"uncommonly awkward\" depending on who died first.The \"whendunit\" becomes a whodunit when it is revealed that the general was poisoned. The unflappable Wimsey has a colorful gallery of suspects to consider, including the increasingly unhinged George, one of the general's grandsons (why is he smashing a bottle of digitalis?), and Ann Dorland, who stands to benefit most if the general died first (what's the deal with the books on chemistry and poisons she has recently purchased?). Other memorable characters further enliven the proceedings, among them the Munns, George's bickering (and at one point blackmailing) landlords.As the very British title suggests, this is not a crime thriller to set the pulse racing (the discovery of Fentiman's body is referred to as \"something rather unpleasant\"). But as the mystery unfolds over the course of 180 minutes (and 4 volumes), it is as captivating as a good late-night read.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000INCJ", "B00005NFYK", "B000056C0J", "B00004W201", "630340488X"], "bought_together": ["B00000INCJ", "B000056C0J"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 422053}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 6.09, "brand": "", "asin": "1569383529", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WAK9V11TL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lord Peter Wimsey: The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club [VHS]"}
{"description": "As critic Roger Ebert observed in his original review ofRan, this epic tragedy might have been attempted by a younger director, but only the Japanese master Akira Kurosawa, who made the film at age 75, could bring the requisite experience and maturity to this stunning interpretation of Shakespeare'sKing Lear. It's a film for the ages--one of the few genuine screen masterpieces--and arguably serves as an artistic summation of the great director's career. In this version of the Shakespeare tragedy, the king is a 16th-century warlord (Tatsuya Nakadai as Lord Hidetora) who decides to retire and divide his kingdom evenly among his three sons. When one son defiantly objects out of loyalty to his father and warns of inevitable sibling rivalry, he is banished and the kingdom is awarded to his compliant siblings. The loyal son's fears are valid: a duplicitous power struggle ensues and the aging warlord witnesses a maelstrom of horrifying death and destruction. Although the film is slow to establish its story, it's clear that Kurosawa, who planned and painstakingly designed the production for 10 years before filming began, was charting a meticulous and tightly formalized dramatic strategy. As familial tensions rise and betrayal sends Lord Hidetora into the throes of escalating madness,Ran(the title is the Japanese character for \"chaos\" or \"rebellion\") reaches a fever pitch through epic battles and a fortress assault that is simply one of the most amazing sequences on film.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301661737", "6303202055", "6303386717", "6303073107", "630296931X", "6301955293", "B000001A5E", "0780018702", "0783217528"], "bought_together": ["6301661737"], "also_viewed": ["6303202055", "6302919649", "6302891272", "6301942647", "6302969697", "6303073107"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 368153}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.87, "brand": "", "asin": "1572522089", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514XW5P94GL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ran [VHS]"}

{"description": "If you're not a connoisseur of graphic horror and gruesome gore, you'd better steer clear of this wicked 1992 horror-comedy from the demented mind and delirious camera of New Zealand-born writer-director Peter Jackson. However, if nonstop mayhem and extreme violence are your idea of great entertainment, you're sure to appreciate Jackson's gleefully inventive approach to a story that can judiciously be described as sick, twisted, and totally outrageous. The movie's central character is a poor schmuck named Lionel who's practically enslaved to his domineering mother. But when ol' Mum gets bitten by a rare and poisonous rat monkey from Skull Island and is turned into a flesh-eating zombie, Lionel has the unfortunate task of keeping Mama happy while fending off all the other zombies that result from her voracious feeding frenzies. If you've read this far, you'll either be crying out for censorship or eagerly awaiting your first viewing (or second, or third...) of this wildly clever and audaciously uninhibited movie. And while director Jackson would later achieve critical success with his fact-based dramaHeavenly Creatures, his talent is readily evident in this earlier effort.

{"description": "By May 1945, the war in Europe was over and the German military was in ruins. The war in the Pacific, however, was far from done and the determination of the Japanese promised that the ultimate cost of victory would be very high.  With the death of Franklin Roosevelt, the responsibilities of the presidency fell on Harry Truman.  Truman had been kept out of the decision-making loop through much of his term as vice president, and had to rely on his gut instinct and on-the-job training to handle his new position.  The U.S. Army had been working feverishly on the Manhattan Project (the \"gadget\"), and the Army's top brass urged Truman to use the awesome power of the bomb to end the war with the Japanese.Hiroshimauses a unique structure to convey the story of that fateful decision, mixing newsreels with new sepia-toned footage, color dramatizations, and interviews with Hiroshima survivors and U.S.&nbsp;military personnel. At times, the transitions between the segments can be a bit jarring, butHiroshimais an extraordinary look at the human element of the decision to use nuclear weapons.  Its painstaking attention to period detail makes it a historical drama that plays nearly like a documentary. Kenneth Welsh, in particular, is an uncanny Harry Truman, having obviously studied the president's clipped Midwestern twang and ramrod-straight bearing at great length.  Unlike many other films on the subject,Hiroshimaalso shows the Japanese side of the equation, with a diplomatic corps ready to sue for peace while the fanatics in the military would never hear of it.  Its unswervingly objective, balanced tone, and sober direction makeHiroshimaa thoughtful and informative look at the decision that changed the course of history forever.--Jerry Renshaw", "price": 29.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 603197}, "asin": "1574920855", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/310E2FDZ01L.gif", "title": "Hiroshima [VHS]"}

Nicholas Rowe plays  Holmes as a schoolboy at a boarding academy for young men.

Levinson makes handsome  and crisp work of this Steven Spielberg production, without a trace of the  treacle that often found its way into other Spielbergian projects at the time  (The Goonies). Rowe is wonderfully  convincing as a teen incarnation of the Great Detective, and while Cox mostly  maintains Hollywood's traditionally unflattering idea of Watson, he does  bring warmth and comedy to the role.

{"description": "The movie that made \"No wire hangers!\" a household phrase,Mommie Dearestis the very model of a modern \"camp classic,\" so crazily outlandish that it's fascinating. Based on the scathing and scandalous tell-all bestseller by Christina Crawford, the adopted daughter of histrionic Hollywood movie queen Joan Crawford,Mommie Dearestwas billed in advance as a serious dramatic motion-picture biography. But it turned out to be something much, much weirder--a genuine Hollywood oddity that serves up a bizarre mixture of melodramatic trash and outrageous tragi-comedy. Joan Crawford won an Oscar for playing the role of the self-sacrificing mother, the woman who would do anything for her daughter, inMildred Pierce. As depicted by Faye Dunaway (playing the hell out of the role as if she's determined to win another Oscar of her own, damn it!), her role as offscreen parent puts her in a league with big-time scary screen mommies such as Mrs. Bates inPsycho, and Angela Lansbury's &uuml;ber-mom inThe Manchurian Candidate. Dunaway's Crawford torments and terrorizes her adopted children in myriad ways--making them give away their own birthday gifts and rousting them from their beds for frantic after-midnight bathroom-scrubbing attacks. And when, after the death of her Pepsico chairman husband, Crawford tells the board of directors, \"Don't f--- with me, fellas!\" one is very much inclined to heed her warning.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301706587", "6301977963", "B004LWZW4M", "B000005XPV", "6304359721", "6301973410", "B000003KE0", "B00005RERY"], "bought_together": ["6301977963"], "also_viewed": ["0767903579"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 304567}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.67, "brand": "", "asin": "6300213919", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N957ZKB0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mommie Dearest [VHS]"}

{"description": "In the tradition of such obsessively driven directors as Erich von Stroheim and Werner Herzog, Francis Ford Coppola approached the production ofApocalypse Nowas if it were his own epic mission into the heart of darkness. On location in the storm-ravaged Philippines, he quite literally went mad as the project threatened to devour him in a vortex of creative despair, but from this insanity came one of the greatest films ever made. It began as a John Milius screenplay, transposing Joseph Conrad's classic story \"Heart of Darkness\" into the horrors of the Vietnam War, following a battle-weary Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) on a secret upriver mission to find and execute the renegade Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has reverted to a state of murderous and mystical insanity. The journey is fraught with danger involving wartime action on epic and intimate scales. One measure of the film's awesome visceral impact is the number of sequences, images, and lines of dialogue that have literally burned themselves into our cinematic consciousness, from the Wagnerian strike of helicopter gunships on a Vietnamese village to the brutal murder of stowaways on a peasant sampan and the unflinching fearlessness of the surfing warrior Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who speaks lovingly of \"the smell of napalm in the morning.\" Like Herzog'sAguirre: The Wrath of God, this film is the product of genius cast into a pit of hell and emerging, phoenix-like, in triumph. Coppola's obsession (effectively detailed in the riveting documentaryHearts of Darkness, directed by Coppola's wife, Eleanor) informs every scene and every frame, and the result is a film for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301115430", "630018627X", "0790701251", "6300183211", "6303686796", "6305363668", "079284646X", "6304935811", "0784011923", "6303953425", "0792836510", "6302822688", "B000003KHS", "630021639X", "6304119046", "B00003CXE6", "6302610702", "0792158261", "B000K7VHQE", "6303036570", "6303020089", "6303651488", "0800125762", "B004LWZW9W", "B00000JGEI", "0790705141", "6302360978", "6302415853", "0783107986", "B00005ATQA", "630336568X", "0790731975", "6305095566", "6300216500", "6301662954", "6302921058", "6300246965", "6300182878", "0800100832", "B00005JKEC", "6304286961", "B000062XM6", "0784011575", "630197154X", "B00004TYS8", "B00004WIDB", "6304414099", "0800116917", "6302517036", "0800199421", "6304259131", "0783202253", "6303109950", "6303313345", "B00006C7G9", "0792837312", "6302482712", "6300213986", "6303421563", "6304039549", "B000065U6Q", "B0000A36J1", "6300182770", "B00004CNR5", "6304025831", "6303422020", "0790748169", "0800132009"], "bought_together": ["6301115430", "0790701251"], "also_viewed": ["6303953425", "6305363668", "6305750750", "B00000J2KZ", "6303506291", "6303314015"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 172447}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6300214826", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EFVS37MRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Apocalypse Now [VHS]"}

{"description": "AfterThe Exorcistsparked a lengthy trend of supernatural thrillers, this 1976 horror film scored a hit with critics and audiences for mixing gothic horror and mystery into its plot about a young boy suspected of being the personification of the anti-Christ. (No doubt it's a favorite of shock-rocker  Marilyn Manson.) Directed by Richard Donner (best known for hisSupermanandLethal Weaponfilms),The Omengained a lot of credibility from the casting of Gregory Peck and Lee Remick as a distinguished American couple living in England, whose young son Damien bears \"the mark of the beast.\" Mysterious deaths and unexplained incidents draw the attention of a photographer (David Warner), whose investigation leads to the young boy--and also to the photographer's shocking decapitation (in a scene that has since been inducted into the horror hall of fame). At a time when graphic gore had yet to dominate the horror genre, this film used its violence discreetly and to great effect, and the mood of dread and potential death is masterfully maintained. It's all a bit hokey, with a lot of biblical portent and sensational fury, but few would deny it's highly entertaining.

{"description": "The off-Broadway comedy-horror-musical hit that ran for years makes a successful transfer to film with a bevy of big-name cameos and two perfectly cast leads. Rick Moranis is the nebbish Seymour, who pines for flower-girl Audrey (Ellen Greene) while living in the basement of florist Mr. Mushnik (Vincent Gardenia). Things start turning around for Seymour, though, after he buys a little plant during a solar eclipse, christens it Audrey II, and discovers that it likes to drink blood. Soon enough, though, Seymour finds out that Audrey II, now grown to epic proportions, is in actuality a \"mean green mother from outer space\" that is hell-bent on world domination. Based on the 1960 Roger Corman cheapie that featured a young Jack Nicholson,Little Shopboasts a hilarious, amazing score by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken, who would go on to revitalize Disney's animation arm withThe Little MermaidandBeauty and the Beast. Greene, the lone holdover from the original cast, is a ravishing, goofy Audrey, whose awkward demeanor belies a voice that could knock Ethel Merman off her feet. She's ably matched by Moranis, whose lack of a singing voice is perfectly in sync with Seymour's nerdiness. And Levi Stubbs Jr. of the Four Tops provides the lowdown, nasty-minded voice of Audrey II; his rendition of the Oscar-nominated \"Mean Green Mother from Outer Space\" is a showstopper. As for those celebrity cameos, Steve Martin's sadistic dentist is a masterful creation, as is Bill Murray's masochistic patient; John Candy, James Belushi, and Christopher Guest also pop up. And there was never a lovelier and funkier Greek chorus than the three Motown-fueled girls (Tichina Arnold, Michelle Weeks, and Tisha Campbell) who appear throughout the film.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301871952", "B00000JGEI", "6303212379"], "also_viewed": ["B006ZUMNPY", "6302890926", "B00005BGO9"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 66547}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6300271285", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NA5EZ89NL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Little Shop of Horrors [VHS]"}

{"description": "From Wikipedia: The Count of Monte Cristo is a 1934 film adaptation of Alexandre Dumas, pre's novel, The Count of Monte Cristo. Directed by Rowland V. Lee and starred Robert Donat, Elissa Landi, and Louis Calhern.\n\nPlot: In 1815, a French merchant ship stops at the island of Elba. A letter from the exiled Napoleon is given to the ship's captain to deliver to a man in Marseille. Before he dies of a sickness, the captain entrusts the task to his first officer, Edmond Dantes (Donat). However, the city magistrate, Raymond de Villefort Jr. (Louis Calhern), is tipped off by an informer, the second officer, and has both men arrested after the exchange. Dantes' \"friend\" Fernand (Sidney Blackmer) accompanies him to the jail. However, he, Danglers, and de Villefort all stand to gain from keeping Dantes imprisoned. The unfortunate young man is sent without trial to prison, on the false testimony of Danglers. When Napoleon returns to France, de Villefort signs a false statement that Dantes was killed trying to escape, which Mondego shows to Mercedes. Deceived, she gives in and marries Mondego. 8 years of solitary confinement follow for Dantes. Then one day, the aged Abb Faria, a fellow prisoner, breaks into his cell through a tunnel he has been digging. The two join forces; Faria calculates it will take five more years to finish. In the meantime, he starts educating Dantes.\n\nAs they near their goal, a cave-in fatally injures the old man. Before he dies, he bequeaths a vast hidden treasure to his proteg. The body is sewn into a shroud, but while the undertaker is away, Dantes substitutes himself for the corpse. He is cast into the sea, frees himself and is picked up by a smuggling ship. Dantes later finds the treasure on the uninhabited island of Monte Cristo. With his new fortune, he sets in motion his plans for revenge. At last, with all of his enemies destroyed, Dantes is reunited with Mercedes.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006AUG6", "B006W95BTS", "6304383169", "6301708768", "6301325508", "6300181421", "6301412796", "6301773586", "0784001804"], "bought_together": ["B00006AUG6"], "also_viewed": ["B000U34PM6", "B000BFJM26"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 324505}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.5, "brand": "", "asin": "630170875X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51k82BWBYPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Count of Monte Cristo [VHS]"}

{"description": "Lane Myer (John Cusack) is stuck in a personal hell. A compulsive, adolescent Everyman growing up in Suburbia, USA, not only does he fail to make the prestigious high school ski team (again), but his beloved sweetheart, Beth, also leaves him for Roy, the team's popular, arrogant captain. If this isn't bad enough, he's stuck with a mother who frighteningly experiments--rather than cooks--with food, a brother who builds rockets out of models, and a best friend so desperate for drugs that he settles for snorting powdered snow. Faced with these prospects, Lane opts to end it all ... until he comes up with a ridiculous plan to gain acceptance and win Beth back. Director Savage Steve Holland warps this simple, clich&eacute;d premise, letting his wacky imagination twist it into a fairly original, slightly dark, and completely hilarious '80s teen comedy. Not as serious a \"suicide-attempt\" movie as, say,Harold and Maudebut just as funny, the film's more a collection of screwball sketches than a narrative. Holland livens the high jinks with surrealistic fantasy touches, including Jell-O that crawls, a hamburger that sings Van Halen, drawings that mock its creator, Japanese race-car drivers who only speak Howard Cosell, and a psychotic paperboy seeking blood over a missing $2. Cusack puts the whole thing on his shoulders and carries the insanity with another one of his touching, obsessively romantic performances, which, along withSay Anything,The Sure Thing, andOne Crazy Summer, made him the quintessential (and appealing) personification of lovestruck adolescence and suffering.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790740222", "6301412761", "6302862787", "6300214753"], "bought_together": ["0790740222"], "also_viewed": ["B00G4RD5H8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 342429}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6301802322", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516EFJKGRQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Better Off Dead [VHS]"}

{"description": "Director Bob Clark's charming, touching, and very funny adaptation of humorist Jean Shepherd's nostalgic, autobiographical Yuletide novel,In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash, remains essential holiday family viewing. Narrated by a man (Shepherd) recalling his childhood, the film looks back at the compulsive efforts of 7-year-old Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) as he tries every means possible to acquire his dream Christmas gift--a Daisy-brand Red Ryder repeating BB carbine with a compass mounted in the stock. Problem is, he lives in a Norman Rockwell-esque Midwestern town in the 1940s, where his parents, teachers, and even Santa Claus all warn Ralphie that \"he'll shoot his eye out.\" Episodic in nature and seen entirely through the eyes of a child, the film offers a wonderful look at the day-to-day eccentricities that grew out of this conservative period. More interestingly, it cleverly captures childhood urgency, where even the most trivial fantasies or objects become immediate life-or-death necessities. While countless family Christmas movies serve up clich&eacute;d situations suffocating with preachy sermons, Clark's acute eye for detail and odd mixture of warmth, satire, and quirky humor are the reasons why so many viewers have rediscovered this after it initially bombed in the theaters. Sentimental without being syrupy, it's a true rarity: a holiday movie that adults and children can enjoy equally, for completely different reasons and regardless of the season.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["079070546X", "6301969707", "6303215734", "B00005LOUS", "6302091632", "B001E4TDR2", "B00000JS61", "5559477621", "6304209266", "B0002F6BQU", "6304117752", "6304400551", "6303442447", "6302526574", "6304089767", "6302794331", "6301390725", "6305123616", "0788812807", "6302765536", "6303314015", "B00005LL26", "0307142450", "6301404440", "6300215695", "6303122647", "B000YABV7W", "0793941520", "0783215517", "6302503795", "B00004UGAU", "B000003KLW", "0375810331", "B00004VVP8", "6301912810", "6301578805", "B00004RFHF", "6301300394", "6302090873", "B0000D14JV", "6300157601", "B00000JGEK", "B00008X5J8", "6301928458", "B00000JKNL", "6301627768", "0800139151", "B00001IVED", "B00001YX9H", "6304140738", "6301798503", "6303675212", "6300989003", "B00005A1VG", "6302581907", "0767825985", "6300216993", "6301670140", "6301977742"], "bought_together": ["079070546X"], "also_viewed": ["6301969707", "B00001IVED", "B00005LOUS", "6303215734", "B00006HBUC", "6304117752", "6302914469", "6304500831", "6303212379", "6304400225", "6300274268", "6302787068", "155890641X", "B00000JS61", "6302178924", "6304434340", "B00004VVP8", "6304089767", "6302642248", "B0007KTBIU", "B00005LL26", "0788812408", "6304400551", "B0000AQZYM", "6303314015", "6302961572", "B00005JKDQ", "6304718551", "B0002F6BQU", "0783231482", "0792839846", "B000028U3S", "B00006FDMY", "6303123244", "B00003CX7L", "6305123616", "B00003CX8I", "6302320402", "0790719029", "6300213668", "6304143184", "1560395966", "B00005O5ML", "6302503795", "B00000K4ZI", "0788805843", "0790742578", "6303212395", "1560395737", "6303338690", "6302091632", "6304290888", "0790700506", "0790742322", "B00000490M", "B00004TX1W", "6304539274", "B00004RFHF", "6304151306"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 318159}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6301966554", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512TVV2E0DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Christmas Story [VHS]"}
{"description": "Lust for Lifeis appropriately titled, for merepassionseems inadequate when describing this superb fictionalized biography (based on Irving Stone's popular novel) of Vincent Van Gogh. In a deservedly Oscar&reg;- nominated performance, Kirk Douglas is physically and emotionally perfect as the tormented Dutch painter, whose life is chronicled from his ill-fated stint as a preacher to Belgian miners in 1878, to his Impressionist-inspired artistic awakening and psychological descent to suicide in 1890. Having triumphed with 1952'sThe Bad and the Beautiful, Douglas, producer John Houseman, and director Vincente Minnelli brought vigor and vitality to this blessed project, which centers on Van Gogh's stormy friendship with fellow artist Gaugin (Oscar-winner Anthony Quinn). Minnelli used an outmoded color film process and innovative camera techniques to vividly recreate Van Gogh's paintings, and he filmed on the actual Dutch and French locations where Van Gogh's mastery flourished. The artist's lust for life also fed his madness, and this film deeply understands the fine line in between.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0452262496", "6301628667", "6301628616", "B000056BRF", "6303037380", "630266232X"], "bought_together": ["0452262496"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 216652}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6301971191", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YCP9MZK5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lust for Life [VHS]"}
{"description": "Kevin Costner as a warped serial killer, a pillar of the community whose dark side is embodied by an on-screen William Hurt? You have to admit, it sounds intriguing, right?Mr. Brooksis the vehicle for this unsavory story, and it turns out to be a lot less kicky than it sounds. Mr. Brooks is a Portland, Oregon tycoon and philanthropist whose \"addiction\" to murder is suddenly re-surfacing--with plenty of help from his sneering alter ego, who generally sits in the back of the car, goading Mr. Brooks on. (The other characters can't see William Hurt in all this, of course.) The unbelievably convoluted plot has Mr. Brooks confronted by a blackmailer (comedian Dane Cook) who has a surprising twist on things, and trailed by a cop (Demi Moore) who comes equipped with her own set of professional and marital woes. As if that weren't enough, when Brooks's daughter (Danielle Panabaker) comes home, it becomes clear that some traits run in the family.The scenes with Costner and Hurt are the best stuff in the film, even if director Bruce Evans can't figure out how to play fair visualizing their presence to others. But the script, which among other whoppers make Demi Moore's character a millionaire, is just too unbelievable to stomach. If William Hurt's character provided a running commentary for this movie, there wouldn't be anything left after he got through mocking it.--Robert HortonThe Cast ofMr. BrooksKevin CostnerWilliam HurtDemi MooreDane CookMarg HelgenbergerDanielle PanabakerBeyondMr. BrooksMr. Brookson Blu-RayMr. Brooks: Music From The Motion PictureMore from MGMStills fromMr. Brooks", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767817729", "B0038RSJB4", "B003AWRM9M", "B000R4SMCW", "B002U4UYYQ", "B002NZK5Q4", "B000KF0GWW", "B001ILFUBE", "B00005JKZH", "B00B83ROIE", "0792844874", "B0068FZ0O2", "B002NZK5TQ", "B00JA3RVG4", "B0000TANUI", "B004EPYZP8", "078324021X", "B003UESJEM", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B003L20IG0", "B00005JNP4", "B002AT8KAG", "B00AEFXSLE", "B000FKO5QK", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEBB9NM", "B002GHHHHO", "B002QW7AMG", "B000WMA6R8", "0783233507", "B000OYC7BW", "B0007NFLO0", "B00005J760", "B00006AUJR", "B0006N2EZ0", "B00005Y1UV", "B000F5WR4W", "B0010YSD8Q", "B000GFLKF8", "B002NZK5RI", "B002DU39GW", "B0019EXZY4", "B003ASLJJU", "B002AF4Y9G", "B00HLSW6II", "B004FQX59I", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00005V9HH", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00005JMWP", "B004SIP8ZM", "B004A8ZX28", "B004AOECXI", "B000FFL2G6", "B002QEHPQU", "B00AEBB86A", "B00005JLZN", "B002VWNID6", "B003PIUIIS", "B009HIKAN8", "B000YENUI6", "B0009YA3OA", "B000E5N6LG", "B005NKIPUY", "B000RGN2JI", "B00005JN2Z", "B0006HBZXS", "B00005JLKN", "B004ULNJIU", "B0001FR3IQ", "B003U6SJY0", "B002CPMB9O", "B003Y5H5HO", "B00366BBTO", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B000P0J0EW", "B003ASLJQI", "B000E5KURY", "B00006RCNY", "B00005JPD0", "B002NZK5VO", "B000LP6KNU", "B00AEBB8LA", "6305313687", "B002AT8KD8", "B004BZ5AMI", "B007FQXEXW", "B000EMGICS", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEFXVOI", "B0006J28NC", "B000UGBOT0", "B008E70EES", "B00DU22OI6", "B002ZG99N6", "B000P0J0EM", "B005LAIGLE", "B0000JCFMW", "B002XMGGK6", "B00008CMRK"], "bought_together": ["B000R4SMCW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0767817729", "B00JA3RVG4", "0792844874", "B000KF0GWW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10765}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.83, "brand": "Mgm/Ua Studios", "asin": "6301971345", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WP046mMoL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mr. Brooks"}
{"description": "Though this film is a relatively minor one in the massive canon of Peter Sellers, it has moments of absolute hilarity. Written and directed by Blake Edwards, one of Sellers's most fertile collaborators, the film stars Sellers as a would-be actor from India (let them try to get away with that today) who is a walking disaster area. After ruining a day's shooting as an extra on a film, he finds himself unintentionally invited to a big Hollywood party. That's pretty much it as far as plot goes, but Edwards and Sellers know how to milk a simple idea for an unending string of slapstick gags. The result is a film that is episodic and sketchy, but also frequently loony in an inspired way.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001Y9YJ8", "630026906X", "0800132009"], "also_viewed": ["B0001Y9YJ8", "B001LXIDUY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 269263}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6301972066", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517K9AV2DSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Party [VHS]"}
{"description": "Sidney Lumet's directorial debut remains a tense, atmospheric (though slightly manipulative and stagy) courtroom thriller, in which the viewer never sees a trial and the only action is verbal. As he does in his later corruption commentaries such asSerpicoorQ & A, Lumet focuses on the lonely one-man battles of a protagonist whose ethics alienate him from the rest of jaded society. As the film opens, the seemingly open-and-shut trial of a young Puerto Rican accused of murdering his father with a knife has just concluded and the 12-man jury retires to their microscopic, sweltering quarters to decide the verdict. When the votes are counted, 11 men rule guilty, while one--played by Henry Fonda, again typecast as another liberal, truth-seeking hero--doubts the obvious. Stressing the idea of \"reasonable doubt,\" Fonda slowly chips away at the jury, who represent a microcosm of white, male society--exposing the prejudices and preconceptions that directly influence the other jurors' snap judgments. The tight script by Reginald Rose (based on his own teleplay) presents each juror vividly using detailed soliloquies, all which are expertly performed by the film's flawless cast. Still, it's Lumet's claustrophobic direction--all sweaty close-ups and cramped compositions within a one-room setting--that really transforms this contrived story into an explosive and compelling nail-biter.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783222955", "6300181987", "6304071876", "6300183513", "6304039530", "6304119046", "0790731975", "6300987485", "6304429274", "1558807780", "6301977149", "6303282237", "6302413435", "B00000K3C7", "6302226899", "B000BWIZRW", "B000006GCU", "6304111231", "0790743531", "6304111363", "6302935148", "6304383169", "6300181529", "6301797957", "630347327X", "0800125762", "B00008FECE", "6303402348", "6303506291", "630522269X", "6305613516", "0783221347", "6304151306", "6301973305"], "also_viewed": ["B00004YRHZ", "B002VRNJTE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 259403}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.87, "brand": "", "asin": "6301976061", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5188HQ5P25L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "12 Angry Men [VHS]"}

{"description": "Two of the juiciest roles in the American theater fall at the feet of Spencer Tracy and Fredric March, and both men make a meal of it.Inherit the Wind, based on the play by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee, is a slightly fictionalized account of the Scopes Monkey Trial, that galvanizing legal drama of the 1920s. When a young Tennessee teacher is prosecuted for teaching the theory of evolution in a public school, he receives unwanted public attention as well as the legal advice of a giant. Tracy plays the role based on Clarence Darrow, the eloquent defense attorney, and March storms his way through a part based on Williams Jennings Bryan, the failed presidential candidate (and famed orator) who prosecuted the case. Gene Kelly plays a character based on the acid-penned H.L. Mencken, reporting on the trial and caustically commenting on the absurdity of the human animal. Stanley (Judgment at Nuremberg) Kramer's direction is not especially subtle, but the verbal fireworks unleashed during the trial sequences are still stirring. Even the different styles of the actors are intriguing: March is all mannerism and false padding around the belly, while Tracy does his patented naturalistic grumbling. It would be nice if this story were a quaint period piece, but its issues and arguments keep reemerging in the headlines with each new generation.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792837967", "B0000EYUCK", "B0010YSD7W", "B002NZK5VO", "0800100832", "B004FQX5B6", "6301628454", "6303402070", "630438100X", "6302353785", "6300215962", "0792838556", "B003MG6FJY", "630197803X", "630396155X", "1555265952", "6303057225", "B000A1KF8Q", "6301412796", "6302098424", "B000EO7AIC", "6301647734", "630197638X"], "bought_together": ["0792837967"], "also_viewed": ["B003B3NV6I"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 260813}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6302120624", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51D8EEZ5TZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Inherit the Wind [VHS]"}

Roger Moore, in his second outing as James Bond, meets Christopher Lee's Scaramanga, one of the most magnetic villains in the entire series, in this entertaining but rather wan entry in the 007 sweepstakes. Bond's globetrotting search takes him to Hong Kong, Bangkok, and finally China, where Scaramanga turns his island retreat into a twisted theme park for a deadly game of wits between the gunmen, moderated by Scaramanga's diminutive man Friday Nick Nack (Fantasy Island's Herv&eacute; Villechaize). Britt Ekland does her best as the most embarrassingly inept Bond girl in 007 history, a clumsy, dim agent named Mary Goodnight who looks fetching in a bikini, while Maud Adams is Scaramanga's tough but haunted lover and assistant (she returns to the series as the title character inOctopussy). Clifton James, the redneck sheriff fromLive and Let Die, makes an embarrassing and ill-advised appearance as a racist tourist who briefly teams up with 007 in what is otherwise the film's highlight, a high-energy chase through the crowded streets of Bangkok that climaxes with a breathtaking midair corkscrew jump. Bond and company are let down by a lazy script, but Moore balances the overplayed humor with a steely performance and Lee's charm and enthusiasm makes Scaramanga a cool, deadly, and thoroughly enchanting adversary.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302510023", "6302510031", "630251018X", "630251004X", "6302510007", "6302380596", "6304047843", "6302510198", "630238060X", "6302380294", "B0000068SI", "B00008V2VP", "6304032579", "6302380588", "B000006FNX", "B00004TYS8", "6303651461", "6303651488", "6305784906", "B00004RWUH", "6302824613", "6303212263", "630596260X"], "bought_together": ["6302510023", "6302510031"], "also_viewed": ["6302380588", "6302510031", "6302510007", "6302510023", "B00004TYS8", "6302380294", "6304047843", "630251018X", "630251004X", "6303651488", "630238060X", "6303651461", "6302380596", "6302510198", "B00008V2VP", "6304032579"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 170742}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.58, "brand": "", "asin": "6302510015", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510E8WWVDZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Man With the Golden Gun [VHS]"}

{"description": "Like moths to a flame, great actors gravitate to the singular genius of playwright-screenwriter David Mamet, who updated his Pulitzer Prize-winning play for this all-star screen adaptation. The material is not inherently cinematic, so the movie's greatest asset is Mamet's peerless dialogue and the assembly of a once-in-a-lifetime cast led by Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, and Alec Baldwin (the last in a role Mamet created especially for the film). Often regarded as a critique of the Reagan administration's impact on the American economy, the play and film focus on a competitive group of real estate salesmen who've gone from feast to famine in a market gone cold. When an executive \"motivator\" (Alec Baldwin) demands a sales contest among the agents in the cramped office, the stakes are critically high: any agent who fails to meet his quota of sales \"leads\" (i.e., potential buyers) will lose his job. This intense ultimatum is a boon for the office superstar (Pacino), but a once-successful salesman (Lemmon) now finds himself clinging nervously to faded glory. Political and personal rivalries erupt under pressure when the other agents (Alan Arkin, Ed Harris) suspect the office manager (Kevin Spacey) of foul play. This cauldron of anxiety, tension, and sheer desperation provides fertile soil for Mamet's scathingly rich dialogue, which is like rocket fuel for some of the greatest actors of our time. Pacino won an Oscar nomination for his volatile performance, but it's Lemmon who's the standout, doing some of the best work of his distinguished career. Director James Foley shapes Mamet's play into a stylish, intensely focused film that will stand for decades as a testament to its brilliant writer and cast.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303515223", "1558807780"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 369412}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.3, "brand": "", "asin": "6302732875", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51S2V1ZW1GL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Glengarry Glen Ross [VHS]"}

Or at least it starts brightly enough--the anarchic humor soon settles into mirthful memories and a sense of melancholy as the ghosts of Christmas past, present, and future take Scrooge on a journey of his lonely, wasted life. Michael Caine makes a wonderful Scrooge, delightfully rediscovering the meaning of life as fantastic creations from Henson's Creature Shop (developed specially for this film) take the reins as the three ghosts.

{"description": "Certain to remain one of the greatest haunted-house movies ever made, Robert Wise'sThe Haunting(1963) is antithetical to all the gory horror films of subsequent decades, because its considerable frights remain implicitly rooted in the viewer's sensitivity to abject fear. A classic spook-fest based on Shirley Jackson's novelThe Haunting of Hill House(which also inspired the 1999 remake directed by Jan de Bont), the film begins with a prologue that concisely establishes the dark history of Hill House, a massive New England mansion (actually filmed in England) that will play host to four daring guests determined to investigate--and hopefully debunk--the legacy of death and ghostly possession that has given the mansion its terrifying reputation.Consumed by guilt and grief over her mother's recent death and driven to adventure by her belief in the supernatural, Eleanor Vance (Julie Harris) is the most unstable--and therefore the most vulnerable--visitor to Hill House. She's invited there by anthropologist Dr. Markway (Richard Johnson), along with the bohemian lesbian Theodora (Claire Bloom), who has acute extra-sensory abilities, and glib playboy Luke Sanderson (Russ Tamblyn, from Wise'sWest Side Story), who will gladly inherit Hill House if it proves to be hospitable. Of course, the shadowy mansion is anything but welcoming to its unwanted intruders. Strange noises, from muffled wails to deafening pounding, set the stage for even scarier occurrences, including a door that appears tobreathe(with a slowly turning doorknob that's almost unbearably suspenseful), unexplained writing on walls, and a delicate spiral staircase that seems to have a life of its own.The genius ofThe Hauntinglies in the restraint of Wise and screenwriter Nelson Gidding, who elicit almost all of the film's mounting terror from the psychology of its characters--particularly Eleanor, whose grip on sanity grows increasingly tenuous. The presence of lurking spirits relies heavily on the power of suggestion (likewise the cautious handling of Theodora's attraction to Eleanor) and the film's use of sound is more terrifying than anything Wise could have shown with his camera.

{"description": "Carl Reiner tried to give the Mel Brooks treatment to theFatal Attraction/Basic Instinctgenre of films about vicious, conniving women and the not-so-bright men who get involved with them. In this case, it's Armand Assante, an actor not particularly known for his comedic chops. He plays a guy who is both a police detective and a defense attorney, so he can defend the people he arrests. He becomes the target of a female stalker (Sean Young, in a bit of typecasting), as well as the dupe in a murder plot involving his wife (Kate Nelligan). Reiner takes a scattershot approach to comedy, hoping to play in the same ballpark as the Zucker brothers or Brooks.

{"description": "This huge 1993 hit for Robin Williams and director Chris Columbus (Home Alone), based on a novel calledAlias Madame Doubtfireby Anne Fine, stars Williams as a loving but flaky father estranged from his frustrated wife (Sally Field). Devastated by a court order limiting his time with the children, Williams's character disguises himself as a warm, old British nanny who becomes the kids' best friend. As with Dustin Hoffman's performance inTootsie, Williams's drag act--buried under layers of latex and padding--is the show, and everything and everyone else on screen serves his sometimes frantic role. Since that's the case, it's fortunate that Williams is Williams, and his performance is terribly funny at times and exceptionally believable in those scenes where his character misses his children. Playing Williams's brother, a professional makeup artist, Harvey Fierstein has a good support role in a bright sequence where he tries a number of feminine looks on Williams before settling on Mrs. Doubtfire's visage.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302091632", "6302800420", "6303257844", "6302765536", "630339406X", "B00329TVQA", "6302581907", "6303140157", "6300247236", "6304416415", "B00004XPQQ", "B000005PFL", "0800196767", "B000008IPR", "0783230893", "B000007OY0", "6304500718", "6302089654", "6303409997", "6300213668", "630273973X", "6304311834", "6302426200"], "bought_together": ["6302800420"], "also_viewed": ["0792151712", "6302961572", "6303314015", "6304233639", "0788806270", "0788812408", "B00005JKDQ", "6304290888", "6303983812", "0788812807", "6302765536", "155890641X", "6305229449", "0788805843", "0788811002", "B00003CXXI", "B00003CXQX", "6301966988", "6304089767", "0790727382", "6303402348", "6304500831", "B0000DCGT1", "6305326940", "5554458521", "6302091632", "6304401132", "B00007J88X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 106101}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.95, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "6303049079", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51lvoybRsfL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mrs Doubtfire [VHS]"}

Unfortunately, the lady happens to be the target of her mobster ex-husband (Michael Parks), who has a tight grip on New York's garment district. Disfigured and finally murdered by her former spouse, Olivia is avenged in very creative ways by Paul, who resorts to such esoterica as using a remote-controlled soccer ball to deliver an explosive punishment. Bronson largely phones it in for this potboiler, though even in the winter of his life he can look quite compelling in his stoic way.

But a murderous gang called the Cowboys has burst on the scene, and Earp can't keep his gun belt off any longer.

Escapes are rare: a drink at the company bar or a carnival. An outsider provokes talk of a strike, something the failing owners want as well. When the workers revolt, it becomes a monster.

Mikhalkov treats all this as a matter of personal and political intrigue dropping like rotting fruit in the middle of a sunny and loving period for the Kotov clan. The director ingeniously understates the mounting threat until one begins to realize that the Kotovs are only geographically distant from the long, bloody reach of Stalin.

The two similar films feature a handsome, duplicitous Hudson duping--then falling for--an earnest Day. InLover Come Back, the two play Jerry Webster and Carol Templeton, rival advertising agents, vying for the same clients--until Jerry makes up a product, Vip, to get out of a scrape. As Madison Avenue catches Vip fever, Jerry falls deeper into the fa&ccedil;ade-and into love with Carol, who schemes to steal the nonexistent account away from him. Tony Randall plays Peter Ramsay, Webster's hapless boss. While Day and Hudson are as adorable as ever (and would continue to be in 1964'sSend Me No Flowers), a standout is fellowPillow TalkandSend Me No Flowerscostar Randall. He's an effective foil--both comically and physically (as he stands next to the much taller Hudson).

{"description": "One of the first Hollywood films to deal openly with white racism toward Japanese Americans during World War II, this drama directed by 1950s action maestro John Sturges (The Great Escape) stars Spencer Tracy as a one-armed stranger named MacReedy, who arrives in the tiny town of Black Rock on a hot day in 1945. Seeking a hotel room and the whereabouts of an ethnic Japanese farmer named Komoko, MacReedy runs smack into a wall of hostility that escalates into serious threats. In time it becomes apparent that Komoko has been murdered by a local, racist chieftain, Reno Smith (Robert Ryan), who also plans on dispensing with MacReedy. Tracy's hero is forced to fight his way past Smith's goons (among them Ernest Borgnine and Lee Marvin) and sundry allies (Anne Francis) to keep alive, setting the stage for memorable suspense crisply orchestrated by Sturges. Casting is the film's principal strength, however: Tracy, the indispensable icon of integrity, and Ryan, the indispensable noir image of spiritual blight, are as creatively unlikely a pairing as Sturges's shotgun marriage of Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen inThe Magnificent Seven.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301586034", "6302360978", "6300988473", "0792837339"], "bought_together": ["6301586034"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 233275}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6304111347", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5159TXTQMZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bad Day at Black Rock [VHS]"}
{"description": "One of the most memorably offbeat romantic comedies of the 1990s begins when a talk-radio veterinarian named Abby (Janeane Garofalo) takes a call from Brian (Ben Chaplin), the owner of a roller-skating Great Dane. Brian is intrigued by Abby's voice and asks if she'll agree to meet him. Insecure about her looks and her nonexistent love life, Abby agrees, but describes herself as a tall blonde, then begs her attractive neighbor Noelle (played by Uma Thurman) to meet with Brian in her place. The ensuing case of switched identity is complicated when Noelle takes a liking to Brian who, of course, thinks she is Abby. This confusion gains comedic momentum when Abby safely plays herself on the radio and in a long, hilariously seductive phone call with Brian, but by now the situation has grown hopelessly complex, and Abby has to find a way to reveal herself without disappointing Brian. Many viewers rightly complained that the movie relies on the assumption that Abby is unattractive, even though Garofalo is more attractive and appealing here than she'd been in several movies before and since. Still, this contemporary variation onCyrano de Bergeracis a lightweight, good-natured surprise that values the quirks and foibles that make lovelorn romantics (including their pets) uniquely appealing.--Jeff Shannon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 500978}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.46, "brand": "", "asin": "6304142137", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51T2XARMTML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Truth About Cats &amp; Dogs [VHS]"}

This time out, Wallace & Gromit have teamed up to provide a window-washing service, and that's how Wallace meets the lovely Wendolene Ramsbottom, a wool-shop owner whose malevolent dog Preston turns out to be the mastermind of a sheep-napping scheme! Of course, no Wallace & Gromit adventure can be without a grandiose gadget, so Wallace's latest invention is the Knit-O-Matic, a yarn-making machine capable of shearing a whole flock of sheep just a bit too efficiently! When the villainous Preston gains control of the mechanical knitting marvel, Gromit must race to the rescue, andA Close Shavereaches new heights of clay-animation mastery. Every shot is a testament to Nick Park's patience, his clever ingenuity, and his filmmaking flair.

{"description": "Dick Powell will forever be known as a 1930s crooner in archetypal musical comedies, but this career-changing role shows Powell at his best and remains perhaps the most faithful cinematic representation of Raymond Chandler's hard-boiled hero, Philip Marlowe, ever put on screen. In this adaptation ofFarewell, My Lovely, Powell's cynical, smart-talking private eye is hired by a dim ex-con (pug-nosed Mike Mazurki) to find his girl Velma, and by the prissy stooge of a blackmail victim to babysit him during a handoff. The meeting ends with the stooge's death, and Marlowe is immediately engaged by the owner of some jewels, the wily Mrs. Grayle (Claire Trevor), to recover them. As Marlowe navigates the dark, dangerous world of wartime L.A., splitting his search between high-society haunts and the cheap, smoky bars and flophouses of the inner city, he turns up one too many stones, winds up on the wrong end of a fist, and wakes up to a drug-induced nightmare that director Edward Dmytryk delivers with a mixture of surreal symbolism and sinister expressionism. Powell delivers screenwriter John Paxton's snappy lines and droll asides with hard-boiled cynicism, like someone not quite as tough as he talks; but it's Powell's innate vulnerability that makes this reluctant saint of the city so compelling. Dmytryk's shadowy style creates a visual equivalent to the web of intrigue Marlowe navigates, an almost perpetual world of night.

This time, we follow the fortunes of four people who lock themselves inside a shopping mall to get away from the marauding dead and who then immerse themselves in unabashed consumerism, taking what they want from an array of clothing and jewelry shops, making gourmet meals, etc. It is Romero's take on Louis XVI in the modern world: keep the starving masses at bay and crank up the insulated indulgence.

{"description": "Writer, producer, and director Kenneth Johnson has completely reworked the story of Dr. Banner and his mean, green alter ego, but this new rendition works quite well in its TV format. After failing to save his wife from a burning car wreck, David Banner obsessively delves into research exploring rare adrenaline surges that give people superhuman strength in extraordinary situations. Discovering that the secret lies in the surge of gamma rays from sunspots, Banner purposely absorbs a massive dose of gamma radiation in his lab to try to improve his strength. The unanticipated result? You know--when he gets mad, he transforms into the giant green dude known as the Hulk. Unlike the subsequent TV series, this original film focuses on Banner's anger and despair over losing his wife rather than his being an unlikely hero on the run. It provides for many compelling moments as he seeks to comprehend his confusing metamorphosis, and as the Hulk becomes a threat to the unspoken romance between him and his supportive colleague and confidant, Dr. Elaina Marks. The late Bill Bixby delivers a warm, sympathetic performance as the tortured Dr. Banner, Susan Sullivan is believable as the brave, level-headed Dr. Marks, and Jack Colvin provides the sleaze factor as pesky tabloid reporter Jack McGee. Forgiving its '70s look and vibe,The Incredible Hulkis a smart comic-book adaptation that lets its protagonist do some soul-searching rather than provide a one-dimensional caricature. Kudos to Joseph Harnell's score, which strongly enhances the film's emotional content.--Bryan Reesman", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B001ECDVH2", "B00009ATIM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 573413}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6304288514", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/714HSD0B4QL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Incredible Hulk [VHS]"}
{"description": "Veronica Sawyer (Winona Ryder) has sacrificed everything in order to preserve her place in Westerburg High's most impenetrable social clique, the HEATHERS. As the only member of the group not named \"Heather\", Veronica has to work extra hard just to stay afloat. Going against her own morals and intelligence, Veronica succumbs to peer pressure on a daily basis, faking her delight in the humiliation of the school's less popular students. Bored of the frat parties and cow tipping so popular among her friends, Veronica's curiosity is peaked when a mysterious new guy named J.D. comes to town. The dark, brooding J.D. (Christian Slater at his best) observes Veronica among her pack in the lunchroom (where social hierarchy is most clearly displayed), concluding that Veronica is not a Heather at heart. When Veronica confides in J.D. that she hates her friends and wishes Heather #1 was dead, she never expects her words to have such dire consequences. Before she knows what's happening, J.D. is dragging Veronica on a killing spree staged as a teen suicide outbreak. But as Veronica soon learns, even death cannot stop the HEATHERS. As one Heather dies, her red scrunchee (the symbol of all power) gets passed on to the next Heather in line, and the clique that was the HEATHERS starts to feel like an inescapable social disease. How far will this war for popularity go? By far the darkest of teen comedies, HEATHERS invented a vocabulary of teen-speak all its own, asking questions like \"What's your damage?\" and introducing phrases like \"How very\". Director Michael Lehmann successfully blends the horror, comedy, and teen movie genres, creating a truly original film. Full of dark humor and deeply sardonic messages, HEATHERS takes a fresh look at the often-sugarcoated cinematic world of high school. Set in the 1980's, the film feels timeless in its relevance because of the daring nature of its themes.", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300183416", "B00005T33W", "0767819586", "B000065RCD"], "bought_together": ["6300183416"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 590283}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.94, "brand": "", "asin": "6304361009", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BZA4724XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Heathers [VHS]"}
{"description": "Ira Levin's scary novel about forced conformity in a small Connecticut town made for this compelling 1975 thriller. Katharine Ross stars as a city woman who moves with her husband to Stepford and is startled by how perpetually happy many of the local women seem to be. Her search for an answer reveals a plot to replace troublesome real wives with more accommodating fake ones (not unlike the alien takeover inInvasion of the Body Snatchers). The closer she gets to the truth, the more danger she faces--not to mention the likelihood that the men in town intend to replace her as well.

{"description": "Billy Bob Thornton wrote, directed, and starred in this mesmerizing drama with haunting overtones ofTo Kill a Mockingbird. Thornton plays a mentally retarded man who has spent 20 years in a psychiatric hospital for killing his mother and her lover. Released into the community from which he came, he befriends and protects a lonely boy regularly harassed and abused by his mom's boyfriend (a terrific performance by Dwight Yoakam). The story is ultimately about sacrifice, but Thornton certainly doesn't get twinkly about it. Some of the best material concerns the hero's no-big-deal efforts to integrate into a \"normal\" life: working, eating fast food, earning admiration for his handyman skills, and attaining a semblance of community among other damaged souls. John Ritter has a great part as a gay shopkeeper who tries to assuage his own loneliness by spilling his guts out to Thornton's uncomprehending character.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004WIDB", "0783204914", "B00005QATY", "6302226899", "6300185095"], "bought_together": ["B00004WIDB"], "also_viewed": ["B00005UO7F"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 245128}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.83, "brand": "", "asin": "630445600X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XZ6KFJ0CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sling Blade [VHS]"}

{"description": "Plot is a meaningless term when trying to describeLost Highway. Here, more or less, is what happens:  A noise-jazz saxophonist (Bill Pullman) suspects his wife (Patricia Arquette) of infidelity. Meanwhile, someone is breaking into their house and videotaping them while they sleep. The wife is murdered and Pullman is convicted of the crime. Then, in prison, he transmogrifies into a young mechanic (Balthazar Getty) who is subsequently released, since, after all, he's not the guy they convicted. Getty goes back to his life and meets a local gangster's moll, who happens to be played by Patricia Arquette... but none of this has much to do with what the movie is really about. Dreams are what intrigues director David Lynch. Not friendly, happy dreams; his dreams whisper that what we think is real is just something we made up, something to keep ourselves from falling into chaos. Characters are fragments. Events happen not because they make sense, but because deep down wewantthese things to happen. Of course, in Lynch's dreams, as in our waking lives, getting what we want is not always pleasant. In the movie's best moments, you really have no idea what you're seeing. The screen is a big rectangle of color and shadow, but what it represents, well, it could be anything. And yet, in those moments, you've been given just enough hints of place, character, and story that these elusive images elicit a genuine dread, a sense that you might not want to see this, yet you can't look away; a sense that we are living on borrowed time, that something is fiercely askew in our psyches. As a whole,Lost Highwayis a failure: much of it is padded, gratuitous, and indulgent and pointless cameos bog down an already sluggish narrative. Yet within that failure are moments worth more than the entirety of most successful movies.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009RRUKW", "B000067DGJ", "6303018351", "6303515304", "6300214044"], "bought_together": ["B0009RRUKW", "6303018351"], "also_viewed": ["B007NYDVV6"]}, "price": 29.87, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 372956}, "asin": "6304510861", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/717FGE5YK8L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Lost Highway [VHS]"}

{"description": "At his best, director John Woo turns action movies into ballets of blood and bullets grounded in character drama.Face/Offmarks Woo's first American film to reach the pitched level of his best Hong Kong work (Hard-Boiled). He takes a patently absurd premise--hero and villain exchange identities by literally swapping faces in science-fiction plastic surgery--and creates a double-barreled revenge film driven by the split psyches of its newly redefined characters. FBI agent Sean Archer (John Travolta) must play the villain to move through the underworld while psychotic terrorist Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) becomes a perversely paternal family man while using every tool at his disposal to destroy his nemesis. Travolta vamps Cage's tics and flamboyant excess with the grace of a dancer after his transformation from cop to criminal, while Cage plays the sullen, bottled-up agent excruciatingly trapped behind the face of the man who killed his son. His attempts to live up to the terrorist's reputation become cathartic explosions of violence that both thrill and terrify him. This is merely icing on the cake for action fans, the dramatic backbone for some of the most visceral action thrills ever. Woo fills the screen with one show-stopping set piece after another, bringing a poetic grace to the action freakout with sweeping camerawork and sophisticated editing. This marriage of melodrama and mayhem ups the ante from cops-and-robbers clich&eacute;s to a conflict of near-mythic levels.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792116887", "0792133153", "0800125762", "B00006IUNT", "6304259131", "6304681496", "B00004WIDB", "079212569X", "6302816629", "6304258984", "B00005PJ8I", "B00003CXTF", "B000007OY0"], "bought_together": ["0792116887"], "also_viewed": ["6304259158"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 280197}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.39, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "6304618344", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71PMMMZ3CYL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Face/Off [VHS]"}
{"description": "Halloweenis as pure and undiluted as its title.  In the small town of Haddonfield, Illinois, a teenage baby sitter  tries to survive a Halloween night of relentless terror, during which  a knife-wielding maniac goes after the town's hormonally charged  youths. Director John Carpenter takes this simple situation and  orchestrates a superbly mounted symphony of horrors. It's a movie much scarier for its dark spaces and ominous camera movements  than for its explicit bloodletting (which is actually minimal). Composed  by Carpenter himself, the movie's freaky music sets the tone; and his  script (cowritten with Debra Hill) is laced with references to other  horror pictures, especiallyPsycho. The baby sitter is played  by Jamie Lee Curtis, the real-life daughter ofPsychovictim  Janet Leigh; and the obsessed policeman played by Donald Pleasence  is named Sam Loomis, after John Gavin's character inPsycho.  In the end, though,Halloweenstands on its own as an  uncannily frightening experience--it's one of those movies that had  audiences literally jumping out of their seats and shouting at the  screen. (\"No! Don't drop that knife!\") Produced on a low budget,  the picture turned a monster profit, and spawned many sequels,  none of which approached the 1978 original. Curtis returned for two  more installments: 1981's dismalHalloween II, which picked  up the story the day after the unfortunate events, and 1998's occasionally  grippingHalloween H20, which proved the former baby sitter  was still haunted after 20 years.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005LC4Q", "B000FA57UI", "B000FA57US", "B000Q66Q2O", "B005CFC0N8", "B004P7CNUY", "B0000AOX09", "B004P7CM9Q", "B000VKL6Z2", "B00006LPHA", "B002XD0J80", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B001NPD9LS", "B002YICNE2", "B000GETUDI", "B000FS9FE4", "B001DJLD1W", "B00AEFY2LO", "B00006FI0R", "B00AEFY2WI", "B005CFBYW6", "B00006FDBT", "B00AEFY31S", "B00AEFY37C", "B00005K3NR", "B00004TS0G", "B003UGLCIA", "B0087ZG7UW", "B000I2J68M", "B000V4UFZK", "B0000VCZMK", "B0033B5XCS", "B000AM6OQ2", "B0002JP572", "B002VWNIDG", "B0058S0OMS", "B000099T3M", "B00AEFY1V0", "B002ZG971U", "B00AEFYYH6", "B00003CXCF", "B004LWZW2O", "B001B1UO6W", "B00006FDCD", "B000E1ZBIG", "B004SIP9MY", "B000TSIJWY", "B000WC3864", "B004AC6PMG", "B001DJLD0S", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B004P7CMT6", "B0002CHK1S", "B000FC2GA0", "B008CYDD7I", "B0008191WO", "B0024FADD8", "B0053TWVDC", "B00018D42W", "B00AEFY2AA", "B00DTPRZ24", "B000KJU1KK", "B00AEFY2E6", "B0000CEB6Y", "B0006SGYL0", "B00004Y87O", "B0013D8LAE", "B00005JA8B", "B006ZL1P66", "B000GBEWRU", "B000IMUYJM", "B005J9ZFQG", "B001JFZ1UE", "B007STBUHI", "B000E8M0P6", "6305972001", "B00079Z9WI", "B00005A8XX", "B00009PY4G", "B000FAOC2W", "B000AA4JL6", "B0002C4JJ4", "B0002O7XW2", "B008JFUNYG", "B000HEWEGC", "B002LMSWN2", "B00BM4Q4H6", "B000HCO86I", "B008874968", "0783227434", "B0006SSOHC", "B001JFZ122", "B004LWZW24", "B000Q66Q8I", "B00001QGUM", "B000OYCMLM", "B000PMLJMQ", "B00000ILDD", "B00A1AU72A", "B004SIP9E2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00KDU8HQQ", "B00005LC4Q", "B000VKL6Z2", "B002YICNE2"]}, "price": 19.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 349265}, "asin": "6304697961", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NXT68J3CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Halloween"}

{"description": "One of the greatest screen biographies ever produced, this monumental film runs nearly three hours, won seven Academy Awards, and gave George C. Scott the greatest role of his career. It was released in 1970 when protest against the Vietnam War still raged at home and abroad, and many critics and moviegoers struggled to reconcile current events with the movie's glorification of Gen. George S. Patton as a crazy-brave genius of World War II.How could a movie so huge in scope and so fascinated by its subject be considered an anti-war film? The simple truth is that it's not--Patton is less about World War II than about the rise and fall of a man whose life was literally defined by war, and who felt lost and lonely without the grand-scale pursuit of an enemy. George C. Scott embodies his role so fully, so convincingly, that we can't help but be drawn to and fascinated by Patton as a man who is simultaneously bound for hell and glory. The film's opening monologue alone is a masterful display of acting and character analysis, and everything that follows is sheer brilliance on the part of Scott and director Franklin J. Schaffner.Filmed on an epic scale at literally dozens of European locations, Patton does not embrace war as a noble pursuit, nor does it deny the reality of war as a breeding ground for heroes. Through the awesome achievement of Scott's performance and the film's grand ambition, Patton shows all the complexities of a man who accepted his role in life and (like Scott) played it to the hilt.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303057225", "0800132009", "B0007TKNGA", "6304071876", "6302909023", "6301966317", "6300181472", "B000059HGY", "6300214826", "6300268748", "079213690X", "630407185X", "B00000K3AN", "6301797906", "6301115430", "079284646X", "0790701251", "0790752395", "6302529441", "0783221347", "B00000F13T", "6300216543", "B00006C7G9", "6304151306", "B00005LL26", "630018224X", "6301971809", "6301965817", "6300181340", "630442972X", "6300988473", "630105573X", "0783216084", "6301777867", "B00003CXTF", "B000003KDG", "6303020089", "6301969251", "B000003KHS", "B00004CNR5", "6301662954", "0784011923", "B00000FZCU", "6300215962", "0800100832", "1569942072", "B00003CXE6", "6300271846", "6300181154", "630274721X", "0790734079", "0764004638", "0800125762", "6302415853", "6301976622", "630018627X", "B00005A1VG", "B000007OY0", "B000068TSI", "B00005ATQA", "0800116917", "6300216802", "6303696813", "6300267830", "0790758474", "0792116887", "0783235607", "630197154X", "B00005Q4GY", "B0000048YO", "6302224330", "0800106032", "6303824358", "B000056BRF", "6304457278", "6300267938", "6300182304"], "bought_together": ["6303057225"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 219212}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.74, "brand": "", "asin": "6304935811", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/418V1BMMHEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Patton [VHS]"}

{"description": "At first glance, this 1991 comedy looks like another formulaic fluff-piece with a standard fish-out-of-water scenario--in this case a hotshot young doctor (Michael J. Fox) whose cross-country drive to become a Beverly Hills cosmetic surgeon is interrupted when he crashes in the rural hamlet of Grady, South Carolina. But as Fox's character is urged by the folksy locals to stay--an offer made tempting by his romance with a law student (Julie Warner)--this unassuming little movie just gets better and better thanks to a sharp script and a splendid supporting cast. Well, okay ... maybe Woody Harrelson and Bridget Fonda aren't used to the fullest of their abilities, but for the most part this is a charming and surprisingly intelligent comedy that's good enough to compare favorably toMy Cousin Vinny, a film with which it shares much in common. Fox has all the right moves to make his character both bullish and ultimately agreeable, and Julie Warner's performance may leave you wondering why this fine actress didn't immediately rise to stardom.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783229364", "B000N60H9U", "B001ECDVK4", "B00009AOBH", "6305213283", "B001ECDVJU", "6305236569", "B0007IO6NM", "0783226896", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00AEBB9UK", "B000FO0AA6", "6304765266", "B000JYW5B4", "B00AEFYXJ0", "0783230354", "B002GHHHNI", "076780421X", "B000F6ZIII", "076780676X", "B00AEFY4CG", "B0000542C9", "B00319ECII", "B00015YVD6", "B00DDT0JB0", "6305428506", "B000Y11B7Q", "B00008G7UF", "B002O3Z4YI", "B000FO0A9W", "B000068MC0", "0767810856", "B00803PFXG", "B00158K0QU", "B000YDBPAM", "B000SFOW8I", "B00005NVDE", "B00AEBB9WI", "B0000AOV4I", "B002NZK5UU", "B0045HCJRG", "B00AEBB9DW", "B000023VTP", "B000068TPB", "B00005N5SA", "B00005T7HZ", "0767827813", "B00081U7HC", "B00AEBB99Q", "B004IZYLP8", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000EHRVOW", "B000065V3P", "B00E8G5HZ0", "B00441GYQ0", "B00AEFYW64", "B000CEV3M8", "0792844866", "B00005N5SB", "B0002B15X8", "B002VWNIBI", "B00008DDXA", "B00005ATZT", "B002GHHHP6", "B00AEFXSVE", "078322740X", "B00386EZKE", "B0045HCJ8K", "B00005LOL0", "B000CCBCAI", "B00AEBB8NS", "B0000897EG", "0790732149", "B00005JKBC", "B00005JPQE", "6305428549", "078322799X", "B00AEBB9E6", "B0045HCJJ4", "B0000JBALO", "B005XB8SLE", "B001LXIDVI", "B000056PMU", "B00096S49Y", "B000ANVPPQ", "0790740044", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B00007E2F5", "B000FZETR0", "B00008K76U", "B00006FMUW", "B0009UZG46", "B00009AOAZ", "B00AEFXYOA", "0783227388", "B00AEFXYJA", "B00008MTW5", "B002OGMGV4", "B00008MTW6", "B00008G8LM"], "bought_together": ["0783229364"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0783229364", "B000KG4BCM", "B000FO0AA6", "B000K7VHTQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 4638}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.78, "brand": "WARNER STUDIOS", "asin": "6305133468", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51UZBmCD9rL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Doc Hollywood"}

{"description": "What can two little mice possibly do to save an orphan girl who's  fallen into evil hands? With a little cooperation and faith in oneself,  anything is possible! As members of the mouse-run International Rescue  Aid Society, Bernard and Miss Bianca respond to orphan Penny's call for  help. The two mice search for clues and, with the help of an old cat named  Rufus, track Penny to the clutches of the evil Madame Medusa in a  dilapidated ship in Devil's Bayou. It turns out that Medusa is using Penny  to locate and retrieve the Devil's Eye Diamond--a stone she'll stop at  nothing to possess. With a cunning plan, courageous acts, cooperation from  local animal life, and lots of faith, Bernard and Miss Bianca help  Penny find the diamond and escape from Medusa. The result of their  adventure is that Bernard and Miss Bianca become close friends and Penny  gets adopted. This somewhat dark, classic 1977 animated Disney film is based on Margery  Sharp'sThe RescuersandMiss Bianca, and features the Academy Award-nominated song \"Someone's Waiting for You.\" Voice talents include  Eva Gabor as Miss Bianca, Bob Newhart as Bernard, Geraldine Page as Madame  Medusa, and Jim Jordan (radio's Fibber McGee) as Orville Albatross. Followed  by the sequelThe Rescuers Down Under.

{"description": "Peter Berg's dark comedy about a bachelor party gone horribly awry is highly ambitious in its attempts to satirize suburbia, male bonding, and self-help philosophy, and for the most part it does succeed in hitting its targets with a malicious, misanthropic glee. When five buddies arrive in Las Vegas for some pre-wedding shenanigans, things quickly spiral out of control when the requisite prostitute falls victim to a grisly accident, igniting a spark in an already unstable powder keg of personalities. Following the lead of real estate agent and self-help guy Robert (Christian Slater), the men warily agree on a cover-up and covert desert burial. A couple hours and another corpse later, however, they're already at each other's throats, and their escalating breakdowns threaten to disrupt the highly prized wedding of hard-as-nails bride Laura (a stunning Cameron Diaz). Berg, like most actor-turned-directors (this isThe Last Seductionstar's filmmaking debut) helms the film with a wildly sliding tone and tends to weigh its strengths heavily on its performers. Slater's psycho turn is by far his most inventive yet (he's more in control than ever before), Diaz effectively mixes sunshine with poison, and Jon Favreau is effective and understated as the hapless bridegroom; the rest of the cast, however, tends to play up the histrionics. Be warned, though: Those expecting a sunny-styleThere's Something About Marygross-out comedy will probably be shocked by Berg's take-no-prisoners agenda; this is comedy at its absolute blackest, and no one is spared.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005QAOZ", "B00KPYT9PS", "B000P0J0D8", "B00007AJFB", "B004SIPALY", "B00AEBBA4K", "0780627849", "B00005Q4CT", "B0000VV55I", "B0006GANPA", "B00KNALRZ4", "B00009AOBM", "B000HT38IK", "6305499144", "B000ALM40I", "B00007AJF8", "B00007ELEQ", "B00009W5CA", "B00JQF7ZR6", "6304806434", "B00000IQC9", "0767805763", "B00IKM5OCO", "B00AEBB9LO", "0767835093", "B00J0IN6Z4", "B00AEFXKZ8", "B00007CVRS", "B0000AMJEK", "B00008RH3L", "B00011CZRE", "6305327041", "B00HNTOVX8", "B002AF4Y9G", "B00IKM5MIA", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B00K0MM4AM", "B00005V9HH", "B00000IQW4", "B00GMV8IVE", "B000U1ZV76", "B00FRILRL6", "B001C5LLQ4", "B000YDBP3O", "B000C65YRQ", "B00005V4XW", "B00AEFYD2M", "B004U7MR14", "B0013527L6", "B006QVRVJK", "B004SIP9CO", "B005LAII94", "B0000714E8", "B000053VB5", "B00008975Z", "B00005AVS9", "B00007LB4C", "B000069HYG", "6305594333", "B0001EFV7C", "B0053TWVQ4", "B004UFEJT4", "B000O77SF4", "B000NVIGL6", "B00BTYJYOY", "6305428484", "0792838068", "B00005JMW7", "B0001FGBUW", "B00008O38F", "B00005RYLX", "B002GIBVWA", "B009VCE806", "B001MFNB4O", "0767802519", "B001QE99BA", "B000069HZP", "B00FRILRW0", "B0000E2R6P", "B001R3YRG2", "B0009A40ES", "B001B1UO7G", "B00028Y286", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005UQ9T", "B00FQPLZ08", "B0009PVZD2", "B00004WG2D", "B004SIP95G", "B00008EY9G", "B000M341QE", "B0053TWVSW", "B000E5KURY", "B00AEFYC96", "B002QEHPQU", "B00553K9OO", "B0001XAQA0", "0800177789", "B002AF4Y96"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004GSVX7Q", "B000P0J0D8", "B0013527L6", "B00005QAOZ"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 227213}, "asin": "6305353549", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71670ZG242L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Very Bad Things"}
{"description": "This 1997 film from Norway and neophyte director Erik Skjoldbj&aelig;rg  delivers the goods with unsettling effectiveness. It's an intense, smart,  and taut thriller if only because what it eerily implies is creepier than the  film's reality. Opening with a churning, chilling murder of a young woman,Insomniainvites the viewer--as well as its protagonist, celebrated Oslo  homicide cop Jonas Engstr&ouml;m (Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd)--into the mind and  thoughts of a killer by making Engstr&ouml;m fatally flawed himself. While in pursuit of  the murderer, Engstr&ouml;m makes a mistake; he accidentally shoots his partner and  friend and covers up his deed in a panic. But he overlooks a minor detail:  the real killer has seen him commit the crime. What ensues is a layered,  complex, and unnerving descent into chaos, brought on by the inability to  sleep in this land of the midnight sun. Engstr&ouml;m suffers from insomnia,  which  warps his logic and resolve, and before long he's totally unraveled and  unsure of his every move. But not before a twisty transference and  countertransference occurs between cop and killer. The two play a game of  high-stakes one-upmanship that surprises in the end.Insomniais fresh and  psychologically bent, full of Scandinavian despair and dark humor, and it  boasts a film noir pulse beneath its blinding light.--Paula  Nechak", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005NFZC", "B00006FMCS", "B003LR5BD0", "B00JH4SZWK", "B00JPUUSEE", "B0081HLM2E", "B00000F3CD", "B00GBT62PQ", "B000BB14IA", "B004XVMCH6", "B00HE010QM", "B004N1JGI4", "B001CW7ZSA", "0780022343", "B004ALIG4M", "B005J47Q90", "B00JAQJNN0", "B00K6D1R0I", "B00004W3HG", "B00HT2RTU6", "B003KGBISE", "B004NWPY3E", "B00180R06I", "B00005BHW6", "B001CW7ZSU", "B00000CQJZ", "B00HVOFP6W", "B00005EBSF", "B00000C0QO", "B00005JL57", "B001EOQCJE", "B00HRJVHOU", "B00GPPXNEE", "B00HE01030", "B0000A02TX", "B004ALIG1U", "B0009298N4", "B002IVDLH8", "B00GPPXP6A", "0783228457", "B004WPYO7E", "B00J81S92S", "B000BR6QIW", "B00005A8TX", "B000093NQZ", "B001PYD0KM", "B00000F7E6", "0792838947", "B005152C9G", "B00FXOO2A2", "B001WLMOL4", "B003ELMR9E", "0780021541", "B00B2BYXSG", "B00AQ6J536", "B0002KPHZG", "B003TTBA0S", "B0007GAG42", "B004P2VQZ2", "B0009OUBC4", "6305228876", "B00005QAPH", "B000087EY5", "B00B2BYXTK", "B00005B1ZL", "B001BEK8E2", "B007N5YJWK", "B00005NC66", "B000I8OOG0", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B005KQVE1S", "B001BSBBJE", "B00HE011DE", "B001MYIXAC", "B004NWPY20", "B00005JMVQ", "B00004W3HF", "0780023099", "B000H5U5RG", "B00DZP1C9K", "B0057GYODG", "B00HVOFP9O", "B0009X75EC", "B002BWP4A6", "0780023277", "B00CUKTHES", "B00JQYV0B4", "B000KRNGOA", "B00F98FOFY", "B000305ZYS", "078062856X", "B000OPPAF6", "B001PYD0M0", "B00KE3B7BE", "B0047P5FU4", "B002E01MBA", "B00E18QKJ2", "B00JBGSHSQ", "B00005QAPI", "B006TTC5MM"], "bought_together": ["B00005NFZC", "B00006FMCS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005K3NY", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B00J2PQYYK", "B00J5JSV3A"]}, "price": 22.32, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 40121}, "asin": "6305389519", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/310DKGT5SAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Insomnia (The Criterion Collection)"}

{"description": "Rising to the challenge of Dogma 95's self-imposed restrictions on aesthetic freedom, Thomas Vinterberg'sThe Celebrationis a remarkable  example of the way limits can give rise to creative opportunity. (Dogma 95 is a  Danish filmmakers collective that also includes Lars von Trier, director ofBreaking the Waves. The group crafted a manifesto in which its members  vow to eschew special lighting, optical effects, props, and the visible imprint  of a director's personality in order to attain higher truths yielded by  characters.)The Celebration, shot with a small video camera and  transferred to 35mm film, concerns a black-tie birthday gathering for a  family patriarch, Helge (Henning Moritzen), which erodes into a battle after long-suppressed secrets are revealed and the chance to settle old scores  presents itself. Among the grievances are an accusation of incest and the  responsibility for the death of a child--gruesome stuff, but Vinterberg  doesn't characterize the partying crowd's reaction in quite the way one might have expected. In fact, the whole ofThe Celebrationis about  unexpected perspectives and vantage points emerging from out of nowhere, largely  due to Vinterberg's free hand at editing the film in such a way as to yank  truth from every corner. This is a strong work that belies skepticism over  Dogma 95's bare-bones trendiness, and is perhaps a harbinger of great work to  come from Vinterberg.--Tom Keogh", "price": 13.48, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 384694}, "asin": "6305495777", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RZGN5J8ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Celebration [VHS]"}
{"description": "One of the most endearing and intelligent romantic comedies of the '90s, the Oscar-winningShakespeare in Loveis filled with such good will, sunny romance, snappy one-liners, and devilish cleverness that it's absolutely irresistible. With tongue placed firmly in cheek, at its outset the film tracks young Will Shakespeare's overwrought battle with writer's block and the efforts of theater owner Philip Henslowe (Geoffrey Rush, in rare form) to stage Will's latest comedy,Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter. Jokey comedy, though, soon takes a backseat to ravishing romance when the beautiful Viola De Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow) disguises herself as a young man to wangle herself an audition in the all-male cast, and wins both the part of Romeo and, after much misunderstanding, the playwright's heart. Soon enough, Will's pirate comedy becomes the beautiful, tragicRomeo and Juliet, reflecting the agony and ecstasy of Will and Viola's romance--he's married and she's set to marry the slimy Lord Wessex (Colin Firth) in the near future.The way that Oscar-winning screenwriters Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard enfold their story within the parameters ofRomeo and Juliet(and evenTwelfth Night) is nothing short of brilliant--it would take a Shakespearean scholar to dissect the innumerable parallels, oft-quoted lines, plot developments, and thematic borrowings. And most amazingly, Norman and Stoppard haven't forgotten to entertain their audience in addition to riding a Shakespearean roller coaster, with director John Madden (Mrs. Brown) reigning in his huge ensemble with rollicking energy. Along the way there are small gems to be found, including Judi Dench's eight-minute, Oscar-winning turn as atrulyregal Queen Elizabeth, but the key element ofShakespeare in Love's success rests on the milky-white shoulders of its two stars. Fiennes, inexplicably overlooked at Oscar time, is a dashing, heartfelt Will, and as for Best Actress winner Paltrow, well, nothing she'd done before could have prepared viewers for how amazing she is here. Breathtakingly beautiful, fiercely intelligent, strong-willed, and lovestruck--it's a performance worthy of Shakespeare in more ways than one. By the film's end, you'll be thoroughly won over--and brushing up your Shakespeare with newfound ardor.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790734060", "6304071876"], "also_viewed": ["B00006FN65"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 406033}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.72, "brand": "", "asin": "6305470448", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q5DABSM6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Shakespeare in Love [VHS]"}
{"description": "Ever spend eight hours in a \"Productivity Bin\"? Ever had worries about layoffs? Ever had the urge to demolish a temperamental printer or fax machine? Ever had to endure a smarmy, condescending boss? ThenOffice Spaceshould hit pretty close to home for you. Peter (Ron Livingston) spends the day doing stupefyingly dull computer work in a cubicle. He goes home to an apartment sparsely furnished by IKEA and Target, then starts for a maddening commute to work again in the morning. His coworkers in the cube farm are an annoying lot, his boss is a snide, patronizing jerk, and his days are consumed with tedium. In desperation, he turns to career hypnotherapy, but when his hypno-induced relaxation takes hold, there's no shutting it off. Layoffs are in the air at his corporation, and with two coworkers (both of whom are slated for the chute) he devises a scheme to skim funds from company accounts. The scheme soon snowballs, however, throwing the three into a panic until the unexpected happens and saves the day. Director Mike Judge has come up with a spot-on look at work in corporate America circa 1999. With well-drawn characters and situations instantly familiar to the white-collar milieu, he captures the joylessness of many a cube denizen's work life to aT. Jennifer Aniston plays Peter's love interest, a waitress at Chotchkie's, a generic beer-and-burger joint &agrave; la Chili's, and Diedrich Bader (The Drew Carey Show) has a minor but hilarious turn as Peter's mustached, long-haired, drywall-installin' neighbor.--Jerry Renshaw", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008X5J3", "6304994540"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 339504}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.97, "brand": "", "asin": "6305499365", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/718J2JXRD9L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Office Space [VHS]"}
{"description": "Matthew Broderick makes up for years of wet-noodle performances with his low-key but unsparing characterization of Jim McAllister, a high school teacher at George Washington Carver High School in Omaha, Nebraska. Driven by a strange mixture of loathing and lust for pathologically overachieving student Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon), McAllister encourages a dim but popular athlete, Paul (Chris Klein fromAmerican Pie), to run against her in the election for student-council president. Director-cowriter Alexander Payne (Citizen Ruth) turns this deceptively simple premise into a complex and scathing comedy of ambition, corruption, and desire, all at its most naked and petty. Every scene contains some painfully funny nuance that will make you wince in a mixture of astonishment and empathy. Witherspoon flips effortlessly back and forth from adolescent vulnerability to steely-eyed strength; she's becoming a contemporary Carole Lombard. The movie itself feels like a magnificent throwback to the richly layered comedies of the '30s, which drew their humor from sharply drawn characters and twisting plots instead of explosions of bodily fluids.

{"description": "Bob Clampett'sBeany and Cecil(ABC, 1962-67) ranks among the most beloved cartoon shows of the baby-boom era, and adults and kids will enjoy  the 12 shorts in this collection. The animation is extremely limited and the plots are often thin, but neither matter. People watch these cartoons for the strings of wincingly terrible puns, the lively vocal characterizations, and the comic villainy of (nya-ha-ha) Dishonest John. In these selections, Beany, Cecil, and Captain Huffenpuff encounter beatnik artist Go Man Van Go, So What and the Seven Whatnots, and the Singing \"Dinasor\" (who inhabits the No Bikini Atoll).The animatedBeanywas based on Clampett's puppet series \"Time for Beany,\" which began in 1949. The episodes and clips here suggest this program has aged less gracefully. Although it was both a critical and popular success in its day, black-and-white footage of hand puppets is unlikely to hold modern viewers' attention. Much of the disc (over three-and-a-half hours) is devoted to Clampett's long and  distinguished film career, including intriguing tests for an animated version  of Edgar Rice Burroughs'sMarsnovels and several never-realized programs,  plus home movies, still photos, and an oral history.

{"description": "\"I have a bad feeling about this,\" says the young Obi-Wan Kenobi  (played by Ewan McGregor) inStar Wars: Episode I, The Phantom  Menaceas he steps off a spaceship and into the most anticipated cinematic event... well, ever. He might as well be speaking for the  legions of fans of the original episodes in theStar Warssaga  who can't help but secretly ask themselves: Sure, this isStar  Wars, but is itmy Star Wars? The original elevated  moviegoers' expectations so high that it would have been impossible for  any subsequent film to meet them. And as with all theStar Warsmovies,The Phantom Menacefeatures inexplicable plot twists, a  fistful of loose threads, and some cheek-chewing dialogue. Han Solo's  swagger is sorely missed, as is the pervading menace of heavy-breathing  Darth Vader. There is still way too much quasi-mystical mumbo jumbo,  and some of what was fresh aboutStar Wars22 years earlier  feels formulaic. Yet there's much to admire. The special effects are  stupendous; three worlds are populated with a m&eacute;lange of creatures, flora, and horizons rendered in absolute  detail. The action and battle scenes are breathtaking in their  complexity. And one particular sequence of the film--the  adrenaline-infused pod race through the Tatooine desert--makes the chariot race inBen-Hurlook like a Sunday stroll through the park.Among the host of new characters, there are a few familiar walk-ons. We  witness the first meeting between R2-D2 and C-3PO, Jabba the Hutt looks  younger and slimmer (but not young and slim), and Yoda is as crabby as  ever. Natalie Portman's stately Queen Amidala sports hairdos that make  Princess Leia look dowdy and wields a mean laser. We never bond with  Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson), and Obi-Wan's day is yet to come. Jar Jar Binks, a cross  between a Muppet, a frog, and a hippie, provides many of the movie's lighter moments, while Sith Lord Darth  Maul is a formidable force. Baby-faced Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) looks too young  and innocent to command the powers of the Force or wield a lightsaber (much less transmute into the future Darth Vader), but his  boyish exuberance wins over skeptics.Near the end of the movie, Palpatine, the new leader of the Republic,  may be speaking for fans eagerly awaitingEpisode IIwhen he  pats young Anakin on the head and says, \"We will watch your career with  great interest.\" Indeed! --Tod Nelson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000633ZP", "6301792734", "B00005JLXH", "B00006HBUJ", "6304539258", "6304539274", "6301792769", "B000FQVX78", "6304539290", "0792158261", "B000FQJAJG", "6304117752", "0767729307", "B001GQSY5K", "6304178352", "B000FAGGWQ", "B00BBND56G", "B000FQJAIW", "B00005LL26", "B00003CXCT", "B00003CXI0", "B002I9Z8AS", "B00006AL1C", "B00CFWWDWE", "B000066HAS", "B000001ON6", "B000MUANT6", "6305587159"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLXH", "B00006HBUJ"], "also_viewed": ["B00006HBUJ", "B00005JLXH", "B00E9PMML2", "B0000633ZP", "6301792734", "B00BBND56G", "6304539258", "6301792769", "6304539274", "B00006JDUE", "0767729307", "B00E9PMMX0", "B000FQJAIW", "B000FQVX78", "B000FQJAJG", "B00000IQMT", "B000FAGGWQ", "B003ZSJ212", "0345434110", "6303148352", "6304089767", "0439834775", "6304117752", "B00BUZW14M", "6304500831", "0590010891", "0345341465", "6304434340", "B001GQSY5K", "155890641X", "B00005LL26", "6302961572", "0792151712", "B003W77SEO", "B000M4Y8JI", "0767825411", "B00003CXXI", "B00000IZ8A", "B00169IZN8", "6302787068", "B00006G8LB", "080010367X", "0800125762", "6302091632", "0792158261", "B000850IS6", "6300214826", "6303506291", "B00005V1Z8", "B000641D2Y", "0784011923", "B00008Y47S", "6300214060", "630382790X", "B00003CXI0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 79460}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.44, "brand": "Star Wars", "asin": "630575067X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41SJPKK4S4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Wars - Episode I, The Phantom Menace [VHS]"}

{"description": "Fritz Lang wrote the script to this exotic epic adventure with the intention of directing it himself, but when producer Joe May (a pioneer of German silent cinema himself) read it, he nabbed it, and did the work proud. Conrad Veidt (the stalking somnambulist ofThe Cabinet of Dr. Caligari) stars as a vengeful maharajah with a diabolical plot against his unfaithful wife and her haughty British lover. His plan involves a monumental tomb dedicated to his lost love, a spell-casting yogi (revived from his underground tomb in a riveting prologue), and a world-famous architect (Olaf Fonss), who is secretly whisked away to Bengal. Close behind is his fianc&eacute;e Irene (Mia May, the director's wife and frequent star), who follows him to the maharajah's grand palace. With his piercing eyes and gaunt, hawklike face, Veidt cuts a majestic figure and makes a fascinating villain, his menace tempered with a haunted sense of sadness.Working with magnificent sets and simple but graceful special effects, May creates a sense of wonder and grandeur in the first half of the film, and then kicks it into high gear for a swiftly paced second half of deadly tiger pits, crocodile-infested moats, cliffhanger escapes, and mountaintop chases, straddling both high adventure and dramatic melancholy. The 3.5-hour production doesn't drag for a second.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005OCKN", "B00005OCKO", "B008I3Q0FK", "B000FS9FLC", "B00007K00R", "B0063E00HU", "B00005QW59", "B00917IQ1I", "B001AD8FR6", "B000H5U5IK", "B0007NMKSU", "B00064AEXI", "B000QRIKR2", "B00004Z4VE", "B0000CEB6L", "B000A7DVMM", "B007HS8WI0", "B0006GAOOA", "B00006JMQI", "B00005O5CD", "B00064AEWY", "B000FS9FLW", "B007MCPN88", "B007HRKBM6", "B002MZZUGK", "B001M9ELK8", "B0000WN1JA", "B008CJ0JPW", "B00007CVSA", "B0024R1CF4", "B00917IPOQ", "B001M9ELJE", "B0000E68WC", "B00005UQ8G"], "bought_together": ["B0063E00HU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00CV1PG32", "B00005OCKO", "B001AD8FR6", "B001AD54AC"]}, "price": 33.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 315771}, "asin": "6305908516", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K6BFB3H6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Indian Tomb"}

{"description": "Pixar genius reigns in this funny romantic comedy, which stars a robot who says absolutely nothing for a full 25 minutes yet somehow completely transfixes and endears himself to the audience within the first few minutes of the film. As the last robot left on earth, Wall-E (voiced by Ben Burtt) is one small robot--with a big, big heart--who holds the future of earth and mankind squarely in the palm of his metal hand. He's outlasted all the \"Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class\" robots that were assigned some 700 years ago to clean up the environmental mess that man made of earth while man vacationed aboard the luxury spaceship Axiom. Wall-E has dutifully gone about his job compacting trash, the extreme solitude broken only by his pet cockroach, but he's developed some oddly human habits and ideas. When the Axiom sends its regularly scheduled robotic EVE probe (Elissa Knight) to earth, Wall-E is instantly smitten and proceeds to try to impress EVE with his collection of human memorabilia. EVE's directive compels her to bring Wall-E's newly collected plant sprout to the captain of the Axiom and Wall-E follows in hot pursuit. Suddenly, the human world is turned upside down and the Captain (Jeff Garlin) joins forces with Wall-E and a cast of other misfit robots to lead the now lethargic people back home to earth. Wall-E is a great family film with the most impressive aspect being the depth of emotion conveyed by a simple robot--a machine typically considered devoid of emotion, but made so absolutely touching by the magic of Pixar animation. Also well-worth admiring are the sweeping views from space, the creative yet disturbing vision of what strange luxuries a future space vacation might offer, and the innovative use of trash in a future cityscape. Underneath the slapstick comedy and touching love story is a poignant message about the folly of human greed and its potential effects on earth and the entire human race.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000VBJEEG", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00007LVCM", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B00AFEX83C", "0736424229", "B00005JN4W", "B00005JNQS", "B0042U94UQ", "B00E9ZATJO", "B001OMU6UM", "B00005JNS0", "B0030IIZ4M", "B0034JKZ86", "B002ZG97YM", "B002WJI2QQ", "B004HO6I4M", "B008YWY0HK", "B0012EM5D8", "B0006UEVT0", "B009SZCC9U", "B004G600A4", "B00AAXFYPI", "B00F522C7C", "B008Z1LBU4", "B00CTNYLQA", "B003H9M1Q2", "B000AAF1TU", "B008JFUQ16", "B000ROAK2W", "B000AY74OG", "B00275EHJG", "B00CWM58WY", "B00009M9BK", "B00EV1YZ96", "B001DPHDCY", "B000MV9026", "B001O5LVPI", "0783231474", "B00CQRN3QI", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00I6JOD2S", "B001HN6922", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B0087F7VSY", "B001U2MQE0", "B0030IIYYS", "B00A83075M", "B00H4Z07Q6", "B005LAIH4A", "B000DWMYQ8", "B00CHVJODE", "B0000AOX0O", "B003UESJF6", "B00JK531ES", "B00HLTD2OE", "B0001I561E", "B00BGYO7HG", "B003ZHVJGO", "B001ILFUD2", "B0002YLCOM", "B0039N74CW", "B00004U9WQ", "B00937R6QC", "B00CUDD0C0", "B004EPZ034", "B00004R99S", "B00003CXB4", "B000065V42", "B00005RDSQ", "B004ZBACOE", "B001GCUO7A", "B00AO686JC", "B000AAF1U4", "B0006JMLRK", "B00005JMQZ", "B0043X1FOK", "B00C7JGDBW", "B001JRB17Y", "B001KVZ6G6", "B00005TN8K", "B00005JMFH", "B00E9ZATKI", "B001ILFUDC", "B000V1Y44G", "B00003CX8Y", "B0011U52E2", "B00EBBGLFC", "B000YERP2S", "B00009YXAW", "B00003CXCQ", "B002NZK5SW", "B000G75AZC", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B0084IHVGG", "B00947N6D8", "B004LWZW7Y"], "bought_together": ["B001KVZ6FW", "B000VBJEEG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004HO6I4M", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00I6JOD2S", "B00005JN4W"]}, "price": 17.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 319062}, "asin": "7883706837", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51u-jDIxUZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)"}

{"description": "Edward Scissorhandsachieves the nearly impossible feat of capturing the delicate flavor of a fable or fairy tale in a live-action movie. The story follows a young man named Edward (Johnny Depp), who was created by an inventor (Vincent Price, in one of his last roles) who died before he could give the poor creature a pair of human hands. Edward lives alone in a ruined Gothic castle that just happens to be perched above a pastel-colored suburb inhabited by breadwinning husbands and frustrated housewives straight out of the 1950s. One day, Peg (Dianne Wiest), the local Avon lady, comes calling. Finding Edward alone, she kindly invites him to come home with her, where she hopes to help him with his pasty complexion and those nasty nicks he's given himself with his razor-sharp fingers. Soon Edward's skill with topiary sculpture and hair design make him popular in the neighborhood--but the mood turns just as swiftly against the outsider when he starts to feel his own desires, particularly for Peg's daughter Kim (Winona Ryder). Most of director Tim Burton's movies (such asPee Wee's Big Adventure,Beetlejuice,Batman) are visual spectacles with elements of fantasy, butEdward Scissorhandsis more tender and personal than the others. Edward's wild black hair is much like Burton's, suggesting that the character represents the director's own feelings of estrangement and co-option. Johnny Depp, making his first successful leap from TV to film, captures Edward's childlike vulnerability even while his physical posture evokes horror icons like the vampire inNosferatuand the sleepwalker inThe Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. Classic horror films, at their heart, feel a deep sympathy for the monsters they portray; simply and affectingly,Edward Scissorhandslays that heart bare.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B001AGXEA6", "B008MU8ZM0", "B00AEBBA1I", "B00AEBB9V4", "B008UZBHYU", "B000I5XOWI", "B003UMW68Y", "B0065AO94W", "B001EZE5BU", "B008BSM1GO", "B008QE9VJI", "B0043EV774", "B00GR76W1Q", "B005LAIIA8", "B000M9BPEY", "B005DZ35RC", "B007NPKPN2", "B002UOMGZQ", "B00288KNJU", "B003M8NG94", "B004P29LEU", "B008U0XRD4", "B005DZ35TU", "B000JSI7B2", "B001O8DB1W", "B000NA22C6", "B002S6L6XY", "B000002OFD", "B004VLZUI6", "B0088EDMMS", "B005HARX4Y", "B004SIP7QC", "B001AQR3E4", "B00AJCUL2G", "B003L4Y5B2", "B0039208JE", "B0054QHHHE", "B002QEHPR4", "B0027VTMAE", "B001CO42MU", "B001AR4K8K", "B003UESJLK", "B001IKKMCW", "B000WUMLU0", "B006MOYH0M", "B00993FEUK", "B003ZHR6PW", "B00C888MJ8", "B001AQT0UY", "B00AEFXXFU", "B0039208QM", "B00164GDA0", "B005KQVDH8", "B001HN69B8", "B001D8W7CW", "B000WSLAUO", "B00005R87R", "B00FAI3JE6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001AGXEA6", "B008MU8ZM0", "B00AEBBA1I", "B008FD36IC"]}, "price": 8.5, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 449136}, "asin": "B000005QLO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511ADGQ59YL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Edward Scissorhands"}
{"description": "It's New Year's Eve and a serial killer stalks the streets of New York, looking for his next victim.  Under pressure from the public and the press,  Police Commissioner Frank Starkey (Harvey Keitel) and the mayor (Rod Steiger) reinstate Starkey's brother Nick (Kevin Kline) in the force to track down the murderer.  Nick was pressured to resign some years back and bad blood remains between him and his brother; almost immediately he rubs his superior (Danny Aiello) the wrong way when he turns his office into a sort of beatnik den.  Flanked by his eccentric buddy (Alan Rickman) and the mayor's daughter (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), Starkey goes about running the killer down his own way. This film is a confused muddle--not funny enough to be a comedy, not suspenseful enough to be a taut cop thriller, and without enough chemistry to be a romantic drama.  The excellent cast is adrift in a screenplay that throws in everything but the kitchen sink; Keitel, Steiger, and Aiello go completely apoplectic every time they're onscreen together (which should please fans of over-the-top acting). The first screenplay by John Patrick Shanley after his Oscar win forMoonstruckis hardly cut of the same cloth.--Jerry Renshaw", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 661098}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.08, "brand": "", "asin": "B00000693Y", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q56KQFP0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "January Man [VHS]"}

{"description": "There's no rule against rock anthems from the 1970s in the soundtrack for a movie about a medieval jousting champion, but if you're going to attempt such jarring anachronisms, you'd better establish acceptable ground rules. Writer-director Brian Helgeland does precisely that inA Knight's Taleand pulls off this trick with such giddy aplomb that you can't help but play along. (Upon witnessing a crowd of peasants at a jousting match, singing and clapping to the beat of Queen's \"We Will Rock You,\" you're either going to love this movie or dismiss it altogether.) Other vintage rock hits will follow, but Helgeland--the Oscar&#xAE;-winning cowriter ofL.A. Confidential--handles this ploy with judicious goodwill, in what is an otherwise honest period piece about a peasant named William (Heath Ledger) who rises by grit and determination to the hallowed status of knighthood.As if the soundtrack weren't audacious enough, Helgeland (recovering from the sour experience of his directorial debut,Payback) casts none other than Geoffrey Chaucer (wonderfully played by Paul Bettany) as William's cohort and match announcer, along with William's pals Roland (Mark Addy) and Wat (Alan Tudyk), and feisty blacksmith Kate (Laura Fraser). Of course there must be a fair maiden, and she is Jocelyn (newcomer Shannyn Sossamon), with whom William falls in love while battling the nefarious Count Adhemar (Rufus Sewell) on the European jousting circuit. Add to this an inspiring father-son reunion, Ledger's undeniable charisma, a perfect supporting cast, and enough joyful energy to rejuvenate the film's formulaic plot, andA Knight's Talebecomes that most pleasant of movie surprises--an unlikely winner that rises up, like its hero, to exceed all expectations.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EDWKXI", "0800141601", "B00447L4KA", "B00006ZXSK", "B004SEUIWY", "B002VWNID6", "B00004XPPG", "B00003CXC3", "B00005EBIL", "B000ARXF96", "B00AEFXKUI", "B004SUDQ40", "B001HN69AY", "B004SIP9U6", "0792839137", "B0002YLCG0", "B003UYUQZW", "B003FCKIGQ", "B000056VP4", "B002NZK5V4", "B00005JLO2", "B002O3Z50Q", "B002O3Z4XY", "B00AEFY5B6", "B000GGSMO4", "6305428077", "B00003CXG7", "B00004WG2F", "B00005JN0T", "B0010V4VJY", "B005ORVN00", "B00000JQB5", "6305428042", "6305123454", "0783225814", "B00AEBB9UU", "6305692688", "B0000WN0SW", "B000MGUZCU", "B00006ADFM", "B00005JKCH", "B00AMEZDJW", "B0000TPA0G", "B0000844I8", "B002GHHHHO", "0783240295", "B000K7VHQ4", "B00000K3UU", "B00005JKMN", "B000EPFCPE", "B0006GAI5U", "B0007IO6NM", "B002K0WBXW", "0767821513", "B00005QJJG", "B00008EYA5", "B00004Z4WR", "B00005JKNV", "B00005LOL0", "B004SIP6BI", "B00003CXHJ", "B002NXSRVG", "B002ZG999U", "B004SEUJ9Q", "0783233477", "B000T5O47Q", "B00F84H73Q", "B003U0AHBO", "B00004W4UD", "B00AEFXYOA", "B000AARKOO", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B00005JM5B", "B0001HLVS2", "6305428387", "B002GHHHME", "B000LC55F2", "B00AEBB8R4", "B007SPPANM", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00BLN4V46", "B000EGDB10", "0800195175", "B000FKO5QK", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00BTYSIWI", "B0038N9X3Q", "6305609764", "B000K4WPCC", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00011CZRE", "B00005JMOW", "0800141741", "B00005JPD0", "B001DDBD4K", "B00008G7UF", "B000209KMW", "1558908382", "B004LWZWGA", "B0009RCPUW"], "bought_together": ["B00447L4KA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0800141601", "B00447L4KA", "B00003CXC3"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7604}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "Columbia Telecommunications", "asin": "B00000F4ZY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51rNtZ4oMwL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Knight's Tale (Special Edition)"}
{"description": "Hidden throughoutCach&#xE9;is the sense that you should be watching every moment in this film closely, just as the protagonists are themselves being watched by someone unknown. Georges and Anne Laurent&#x92;s (Daniel Auteuil and Juliette Binoche) enviable lives are terrorized by the sudden arrival on their doorstep of a videotaped recording of their Parisian townhouse. It&#x92;s nothing but a long, unedited shot of the fa&#xE7;ade of their house, but it&#x92;s disturbing nonetheless. Soon another arrives, this time of the farmhouse Georges grew up in, and then another of a car driving down a suburban street, and a walk down a hallway to a low-rent apartment. Again the videos are benign but unsettling. Then the mystery becomes more threatening when they receive gruesome postcards depicting child-like drawings of bloody, dead stick figures. Georges believes he knows who the culprit is, but for reasons all his own  refuses to let his wife in on the secret. Clearly more is hidden here than just the identity of their stalker. InCach&#xE9;, writer and director Michael Haneke skillfully, methodically pulls back multiple layers of deception, like new skin being pulled off an old wound. he masterfully fuses elements of his predecessors to create a film that is haunting and memorable. There is Bergman's fascination with the complexity of relationships, the suspense and lurking danger of Hitchcock, and the unique cinematic sensibility of Antonioni. In fact, the provocative final shot is practically a tribute toThe Passenger--a lot of people will want to rewatch it many times to see what they can find in it (if, after watching it, you are still unsatisfied with the resolution, then watch the interview with Haneke in the DVD's special features for his insights). It's a film of great effect and intrigue. There are no easy resolutions, and the answers given in this mystery will only lead to more questions.--Daniel Vancini", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002BWP4A6", "B00006LPER", "B000SIWHAK", "B00386OWUC", "B00187FPC2", "B00062134E", "B000068MAL", "6305228876", "B0002DB52M", "B00AIBZLHS", "B002BWP3UC", "B000OVLBGC", "B000B9EYFW", "B002AG2NTI", "B0057GYODG", "B00005N89H", "B0036TGSJE", "B000G0O5IM", "B000MTEFP0", "B00092ZLEY", "B0012QE4PI", "B0019UGYAU", "B00005N8A9", "B00023P4N8", "B0007Z0NYQ", "B0001EFUFK", "B000EHQU3A", "B002VKB0M4", "B00151QYE4", "B00005JKJA", "B000N4SHOO", "B00HVOFP6W", "B00AIBZLR8", "B005KQVE1S", "B00K0MM4AM", "B004WPYO7E", "B00HE011DE", "B006KH6CF4", "B000N3T0DW", "B00008976W", "B0007OCG5G", "B000059HA5", "B000083C5F", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B00018D40O", "B002VECLXC", "B00AX7PGQS", "B003VA3JTA", "B00005QAPJ", "B00005OSLQ", "B003Y5H4R0", "B00HT2RTU6", "6305744114", "B00005K9O8", "B00429MM1K", "B002P7UCJK", "080215056X", "B000E5LEV0", "B00009W0U4", "B000EHQU30", "B000BRBA8S", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B00IGK6TH4", "B00005JLQW", "B0007GAG42", "B00000K3TS", "B00K72HVBC", "B00005NFZC", "B000HIVIQU", "B000N6TX1I", "B000OCY7JE", "B007A9EGG8", "B001CIOCLC", "B00AEBB89W", "B000N2HBIO", "B00CQ8HCSM", "B000EQ5V2C", "B000E6EGT6", "B000934FC2", "B0087IT8FK", "B002BWP3UM", "B0006Z2NCM", "B00GRA7M2G", "B00ATK015K", "6305999872", "B001AZJKKK", "B000GBEWNY", "B000GBEWPC", "B00F6SHGF8", "B00008976Y", "B000FVQM2Y", "B00H4IR3JC", "B004ODLUIU", "B0006IUE9I", "B004YCKKH8", "B00455JE58", "B002ZG4Q66", "B0081HLM2E", "B00AEFXN9G", "B0024FAG2Q"], "bought_together": ["B002BWP4A6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002BWP4A6", "B00187FPC2", "B0036TGSJE", "B00006LPER"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17815}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.28, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00000F7E6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41CS99VVAKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cache (Hidden)"}

At 178  minutes, it's long enough to establish the myriad inhabitants of Middle-earth,  the legendary Rings of Power, and the fellowship of hobbits, elves, dwarves, and  humans--led by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the brave hobbit Frodo  (Elijah Wood)--who must battle terrifying forces of evil on their perilous  journey to destroy the One Ring in the land of Mordor. Superbly paced, the film  is both epic and intimate, offering astonishing special effects and production  design while emphasizing the emotional intensity of Frodo's adventure. Ending on  a perfect note of heroic loyalty and rich anticipation, this wondrous fantasy  continues inThe Two Towers(2002).--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B005COPWZW", "B00005JM5E", "B002ZG980U", "B002PMV9FG", "B001GZ6QC4", "B007K3JFUQ", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JNJV", "B001OQCV6A", "B004M1A21K", "B008UZ7MYY", "B00HFFE8HE", "B000A9QKLO", "B000E8M0VA", "B000W7F5SS", "B0014C2FX8", "0618640150", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00003CX5P", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00005QZWI", "B0019L770A", "B000I0RQVI", "B002IPFWTE", "B001CDR1FG", "B0006UEVT0", "B003TT2X6S", "B001OQCV2E", "B009JBWOU0", "B00005JL78", "B00005JNOG", "B001UV4XHY", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B00GKOJ98E", "0345325818", "B0014Z4ON4", "B000H30B2C", "B005LXQLRW", "B001UV4XIS", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00CZDLGDU", "0345538374", "B004LWZW42", "B007REV4T8", "B000W746GK", "B00005JPH2", "B003TT2X72", "B004LWZWGA", "B0087ZG7J8", "B005G4TJUC", "B003ZK99NQ", "B00006HBUJ", "B008UZA8FY", "B0090SI56Y", "B000VI70QS", "B00005JNC2", "B004WCTLNY", "B0014Z4OMU", "6305313687", "B004AKCME8", "B000E6EK2Y", "0547928211", "B000LC55F2", "B0002KVUKM", "B000FQJAIW", "B008JFUO72", "B000FIMG68", "B005LAIHSG", "B005LAIIT4", "B004AOECXI", "B00029RTCG", "B000P0J0EM", "B002HWRYJE", "B0060FXDCG", "B001ECQ75A", "0792839749", "B00AEFXZJE", "B005LAII0I", "B0042U94UQ", "B001HN6918", "B00008G8M5", "B008JFURII", "B003ZKBELG", "B000P0J09W", "B003XURDAY", "B00335EQ0E", "B00008G8M4", "0547928203", "B000W796OM", "B00006ADD5", "B00J49R1BY", "B00B04NIZO", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00001ZWUS"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HFFE8HE", "B00005JKZY", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00005JKZV"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3641}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.49, "brand": "NEW Line Home Video", "asin": "B00003CWT6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Dj%2BQ1hLBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)"}

{"description": "Brendan Fraser plays the best-looking cartoonist you'll ever see inMonkeybone. Stu (Fraser) has created an animated character named Monkeybone, who sprang from his repressed sexual anxieties. He's just sold his animated series to a cable channel, and is being bombarded with proposals for toys and other marketing extravaganzas, when he and his girlfriend Julie (Bridget Fonda) get into a car wreck and Stu falls into a coma. But comas are much more complicated than you might expect: Stu finds himself in Down Town, where lives a mixture of other people in comas and figments of these people's imaginations. Naturally, Monkeybone himself is there, and he and Stu quickly start fighting like cats and dogs. When Stu realizes that his sister, due to a pact they once made, is preparing to pull the plug on him, Stu makes a deal with Hypnos, the god of sleep, to help him steal a golden ticket from Death himself (or herself, as Death is played by Whoopi Goldberg). Sound complicated? Well, from there it only gets more ornate.Monkeyboneis a bit of a mess, but it's never boring, and every now and then it roars to amazingly dynamic life. Fraser is excellent, and the strong supporting cast includes Giancarlo Esposito (Do the Right Thing), Rose McGowan (Scream), Dave Foley (Brain Candy), andSaturday Night Live's Chris Kattan as a gymnast with a broken neck who... well, it's a bit complicated to explain.

{"description": "Five comely and well-to-do female friends receive dire threats inside anonymous valentines. When two of them meet violent ends, the remaining trio suspect that the killer may be a nebbishy former classmate whom they spurned years before at a school dance. Their solution: Throw a lavish Valentine's Day party, all the better to distract them from the hulking, cherub-masked killer...As the above suggests,Valentineis the absolute nadir of the post-Screamslasher film. Australian director Jamie Blanks (whose previous effort was the equally dismalUrban Legend, 1998) obviously had lofty goals for his film, given his bald-faced homages to John Carpenter and Dario Argento. But he hasn't a clue as to how to generate suspense, and his frequent reliance on well-worn shock effects (hands dropping on shoulders, etc.) suggests more contempt for the genre than affection. No less than four writers (including two writer-producers forRoswell, which explains the appearance of series star Katherine Heigl) contributed to the screenplay, which fails to generate the twentysomething drama and hip, cutting dialogue required for this brand of horror. As the five friends, actresses Marley Shelton, Denise Richards, Jessica Capshaw, Jessica Caufield, and Heigl have little to do other than alternately look attractive or afraid; Richards, in particular, looks weary of playing the man-eater. As Shelton's dipsomaniac boyfriend, David Boreanaz (Angel) lumbers through each scene with an embarrassed scowl.Warner Bros.' DVD includes commentary by Blanks, as well as cast and crew interviews and a video for Orgy's contribution to the noisy, new-metal soundtrack.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767824954", "B00275EHDM", "B0020PFYHC", "B00003CXLD", "B0000541TL", "B000AM4P9K", "B00005JOWW", "6305300801", "B000A5045Q", "B0002VYOVS", "B00005J761", "B002ZG99IG", "B000MM0LIM", "B000TSIJWY", "B001AV3BWM", "B000BTIU4S", "B001JFZ122", "6305017115", "B0053TWVQE", "B000F6IOAM", "B0021L8UPS", "B004LWZW2O", "B0009MWELW", "B004P7CN7W", "B001NPD9LS", "B00441GYVK", "B001QMCJ0U", "B005CFBYW6", "B002FICQFM", "B004P7CNUY", "B0002IQLH6", "B00005JMDZ", "0792840127", "B000RGN2JI", "B00005UQ9W", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B0001GF2D8", "B00003CXWM", "B00AEJM61I", "B009IV2Z3M", "B00005RYKU", "B00008LUNW", "B00G5GNYY2", "B004SUDQ1I", "B001G9CNI6", "B0000ALPFL", "B00A2H9L2E", "B000069I05", "B001MFNB8U", "B002GHHHL0", "B00003CWRF", "B00JJOY45U", "078322933X", "B000MX7V3O", "B00GHH9IIA", "B000A6T1ZY", "B000FSME9W", "B00JWXDD6O", "B0002WT4OE", "B00275EHDW", "B00006FI0R", "B00BM4Q4H6", "B000FS2W3A", "B00AJLHUA8", "B000096I9V", "B005GT3X68", "B009IV2Z7S", "B001B8XRT6", "B00006LPHA", "B000WC389G", "B00008DDVY", "B00EU8RC1S", "B000067IXO", "B000ARFPMQ", "B00HW3EJ6Y", "B005ZHBEPI", "B000A6T20S", "B000IMUYJM", "B00AZTUUQK", "B000PMLJMQ", "B000NO3DLG", "B0001ZX0GK", "B008G4T7W4", "B003M05KU0", "B0053TWV46", "B002USF1WC", "B001GCUO4S", "B0052DP1RC", "B00HRUQ7WG", "B00013RC7K", "B0013LL2YS", "B000HT38EO", "B00023P4SS", "B00001PE4D", "B002G1WPI6", "B0054602MG", "B000CCBC9O", "B000UUX2Z0", "6305238065", "B000FA57US"], "bought_together": ["0767824954"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0767824954", "B001UE7D6O", "B00275EHDM", "B005CFBYW6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23437}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 34.99, "brand": "RICHARDS,DENISE", "asin": "B00003CXUP", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JFFE1942L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Valentine"}

{"description": "In the 1930's, Emmet Ray ruled as the second greatest jazz guitarist in the world. But offstage, and particularly in regards to his relationships with women, he was the undisputed king. Academy Award(r)-nominee Sean Penn stars in this richly textured comedic portrait. Emmet's reputation as a renownedmusician is eclipsed by his eccentric career moves, hilarious clashes with gangsters and stormy love affairs with two very different women: Hattie (a breakout performance By Academy Award(r) and GoldenGlobe-nominee Samantha Morton), a mute laundress who loves Emmet unconditionally, and Blanche (Uma Thurman), an eccentric heiress he impulsively marries. SWEET AND LOWDOWN has been acclaimed as \"a loving and comic tribute to a musical era! A standout performance by Sean Penn! Samantha Morton's Hattie is a very sweet virtuoso performance!\" (Kenneth Turan, Los Angeles Times)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000AM6P2U", "B00000JGOI", "B0013D8LC2", "B00008L3SA", "B000062XE6", "6305428085", "B00005JMON", "6305291470", "0780622243", "6305327068", "B003UESJCY", "B00005JL81", "B000IU37SO", "B00003CY6A", "B00003CXGS", "0767819764", "B002LMV7RA", "B00AEFYVUQ", "B00008978N", "B00020X88E", "B000EQHXNW", "B00013D580", "B00005AUJH", "0792846125", "B00005AUJO", "B00A1O0G3G", "B001DJ7PR8", "B00005AUJI", "B00005AUJM", "B00005AUJK", "0792846087", "B00005O06K", "B00005O06I", "B00005O06N", "B00005O06M", "B0064NTZKI", "B00005O06L", "B0054WPX56", "B000034D03", "B001539HQY", "B00005O06J", "B005MYEQ4U", "B00004WI55", "B00A1O0G5E", "B00G7QPXUI", "0792846079", "B00005AUJE", "B007NYZA0Q", "0792846117", "6304907729", "B0007XBKP4", "0792846109", "0792846060", "B002LMV7QG", "B00JLDTBCU", "B003UESJD8", "B00009Q4W7", "B001G9F9IW", "0792846095", "B007NPMQAC", "B0016OM3TU", "B000005H2Y", "B007NPMRXI", "B006FSRSTC", "B00005JL0I", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00005O06O", "B006P7RA1O", "B00GMV8L1Q", "0786670606", "B009UTX4M8", "B00006JCMO", "B00IBIIQTU", "B007NPMSXC", "B00ATP24WS", "B00G7QPYX4", "B005MYEPXC", "B0000UX4V2", "B00J2PQYYK", "B000WC39ZY", "B00004S5WA", "B00023P4JW", "B007NPMMIS", "B0024FAG2Q", "0802142036", "B0001CNRRU", "B003ASLJJK", "B00079Z9VO", "B001DA9VJC", "B000NY0YJU", "B0011U3OA6", "0792846052", "B00003CXGA", "B0000640VJ", "B00143XE1O", "B00HRISNPM", "B000244EWY", "B007NPMOO0", "B000063K2Q"], "bought_together": ["6305327068", "6305428085"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003UESJCY", "6305327068", "6305428085", "0767819764"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12040}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.99, "brand": "iNetVideo", "asin": "B00004STRD", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XC2TPRA8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sweet and Lowdown (Fullscreen)"}

{"description": "While the first season ofThe X-Filesintroduced us to Scully and Mulder, the second season finds the show confidently hitting its stride. Building on its earlier success, the show evolves, and in these 25 episodes, a glimpse is shown of a longer-running story line (which will continue through subsequent seasons) that is woven into the usual stand-alone episodes of the paranormal. These so-called mythology episodes hint at a global conspiracy involving sinister government agents, UFOs, alien abductions, genetic engineering, the ever-lurking Cigarette Smoking Man, and Fox Mulder's father. Season 2 fleshes out Mulder's family history, including the childhood abduction of his sister Samantha, an event that would shape him for life. Actress Gillian Anderson (Scully) became unexpectedly pregnant during season 2, but series creator Chris Carter managed to dance nimbly around her absence and even integrate it into the show. As in season 1, Mulder and Scully are surrounded by a strong supporting cast, which adds a suspicious new agent named Alex Krycek, an informant named X, and a seemingly indestructible alien bounty hunter.Among the standout episodes are \"The Host,\" \"Duane Barry/Ascension,\" \"Humbug,\" \"Dod Kalm,\" \"Colony/End Game,\" and \"Anasazi.\" These episodes are a powerful reminder thatThe X-Files, like no other show on television, can span horror, suspense, mystery, romance, drama, and comedy, sometimes all in the same episode, and always with the production values of a major feature film.--Eugene Wei", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BOH986", "B000BOH990", "B000CNE0SS", "B000CNE0T2", "B000CNE0TC", "B000EXDS34", "B000EXDS3E", "B000EXDS3Y", "B0007X7044", "B001G7PSZI", "B001FACH7S", "B0006UEVUE", "B003V1IU3O", "B001CY5N00", "B000EBGFPY", "B00133QNSG", "B000667HBS", "B00133QNRW", "B000SULWKO", "B000E1MXWS", "B00GTZWZH6", "B0009X76XW", "B000083C6V", "B00005JM39", "B000FOPPBA", "B0070B9RVU", "B00465I156", "B001F7Q4JS", "B000HT3P6U", "B008412UKA", "B00B4804LM", "B001T21R5U", "B00344EAQO", "B00FXUXZCM", "B000AQ68Z0", "B000002N3A", "B00466H3CW", "B00C2U6I3Y", "B000I0QLS2", "B000AJJNI6", "B0007CEXUY", "B004X60QE2", "B00133QNS6", "B000RO6JZO", "B00005JNEQ", "B0019LY5IM", "B00JF5GAZA", "B00003CXZ4", "B003BNO9GO", "B006LG74Q0", "B003BV8I7C", "B0000AOX0A", "B00GX7D5G0", "B000F8O2OM", "B000NDEXK2", "B0012018OE", "B003PGNBO8", "B002GP7ZVY", "B000T9OP7G", "B00HUPC5X8", "B004LROMWU", "B000BNI90Y", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B000244E2O", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B0081QF6Q8", "B002WC89WK", "B00005JLF3", "B008LCRAFC", "B00005Y1NF", "B0050PYNP8", "B00BTYNXJG", "B00009PY45", "B000P6YNSE", "B000I0QLRS", "B000GPIPTM", "B002SAMMEC", "B001ASIHZG", "B00139YA4O", "B00GOC74QG", "B00BD6K54G", "B0094GSRYW", "B000ATQYWY", "B003L77GWE", "B00B5ARKC0", "B00IWTVDUW", "B000FP2OPY", "B0002COTDA", "B000UVV2GA", "B00DNUSFZQ", "B001OLP2TI", "B00008YGRV", "B00IQ8TT82", "B005FISBTO", "B002BWP2IK", "B000I0QLQY", "B00BGI086Q", "B002GP7ZW8", "B00AEFXVOI", "B00003CXKM"], "bought_together": ["B000BOH986", "B000BOH990"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BOH986", "B000BOH990", "B000CNE0SS", "B000CNE0TC"]}, "price": 49.49, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 210082}, "asin": "B00004TS0N", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HA55FHE2L._SX300_.jpg", "title": "The X-Files - The Complete Second Season"}
{"description": "Majid Majidi, whose delightfulChildren of Heavenbecame the  first Iranian film ever nominated for an Oscar, returns to the subject of children for this lush and lovely--if contrived--melodrama. A spirited blind boy with a passion for learning and life arrives home for a three-month break. He's loved by his giggly little sisters and adored by his gentle granny, but his widowed, self-pitying father sees him as a burden and is determined to foist him off on someone else before he remarries--specifically, a kindly blind carpenter who welcomes the boy with all his heart. Majidi is at his best exploring the texture of the boy's world--little hands feeling their way through a garden, the sounds of metal pencils punching out Braille pages, the shuffle of fingers on paper--and his imagery is delicate and lush. The story descends into scripted tragedy and a contrived, action-packed climax (unusual for a cinema known for its restraint), and the emotional tenor turns sentimental and cloying, but Majidi turns it all around with an astounding, heartbreakingly powerful final image. If there is one thing many Iranian films have in common, it's an unerring sense of how to end a film. This is one of the most affecting ever: beautiful, moving, simple, a glowing moment that crystallizes the entire movie.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000065V3Z", "B002VRNJT4", "B002U4F5W2", "B001BOCCPA", "B00116VG3M", "B0087OULO6", "B0006FFRB6", "B000KHX70S", "B002W1HBM0", "B002M36R50", "B006IW8E3Y", "B0009WIE9I", "B000EHQ7JC", "B000A7LR82", "B0009PW3RO", "B00GMV8B1G", "B000P0J00Q", "B001N6FPRI", "B001AZJKKK", "B000B58DHQ", "B0001IXTDG", "B00005QFE5", "0767853512", "B0013B34X0", "B002SF9YNO", "6305362688", "B001JH7F42", "B0000C2IW7", "B001J697BC", "B00ATK0452", "B0016MLIK2", "6305835357", "B000089RTN", "B000GIXE86", "B00031TYGW", "B0012OX7EO", "B0009PW3RE", "B002T921C0", "B004GSVX9Y", "B004XVMCLC", "B0002F6BFG", "B0014N005C", "B000YAA68W", "B005LAIIIK", "B004Y2SDX6", "B00772HQTC", "B00080Z53O", "B0002S64SM", "B0013HL6ES", "B004YCKKIM", "B006F6815E", "B009NI2XUK", "B00006ADES", "B000AYELXI", "B00EO2I6QK", "B00DJYJOPG", "B001BNFR76", "B000KX0IPE", "B000F1IO02", "B000127YXI", "B00065GVIY", "6305081034", "B004NTXH7C", "B0087L40DC", "B0084O26SI", "B00H0EN948", "B00114XLZ0", "B0000UX4V2", "B00D7AM2YW", "B000PHX4FQ", "B000LV6OC6", "B00005JLD4", "B00005JLR8", "B000811672", "B0009P7EI2", "B004P0IRHE", "B000BKVROC", "B0042EJDGM", "B00AZMFM3I", "B008CJ0JS4", "B000H5V8H2", "B000TJ6PA6", "B005HFI7IU", "0783240325"], "bought_together": ["B000065V3Z", "B002VRNJT4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000065V3Z", "B0087OULO6", "B002VRNJT4", "B002U4F5W2"]}, "price": 17.86, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23263}, "asin": "B00004VVO5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51mtblNwsNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Color of Paradise"}

Mona also finds an unexpected supporter in her own, long-neglected daughter, Vanessa (Hallie Kate Eisenberg), who, as the pageant looms closer, finally makes Mona realize where love and acceptance can truly be found.", "related": {"also_bought": ["6306012419", "6305428425", "B00JPJC8RK", "6305870179", "B00005JKJS", "B001GC9VK6", "6305907110", "B00008G7UM", "B0007PLLBU", "B00AEFXPG2", "0783231210", "B00005J761", "B00005JKWM", "B00003CY41", "B00G3DA5XA", "076782153X", "B000J4QW7W", "B005Z9MFRC", "B00447L4KA", "B002XUBDRY", "B002JUFPUY", "B00003CY5P", "0767821769", "B00AMEZDJW", "B000089771", "B00002SSKI", "B000T988I8", "B00000IQW2", "0790739313", "B00005JMXO", "B00009AVA2", "B00005JN3W", "B00AEBBA2W", "B0045HCIYA", "6305803781", "B0006SSMWE", "B00005U8QN", "6305531293", "B00006AW63", "B00006HAWN", "B0002OXRSG", "B0007LXPBI", "0780628306", "B000051S54", "B00015YVI6", "B005XB8T68", "B0019OP0GU", "B00008G7UG", "0783227396", "6305428271", "B00DX88J4K", "B00003CXMP", "B00000JDIQ", "B004SIP9X8", "0800177991", "6304711867", "B002O3Z4VG", "B00004XPPD", "630587493X", "B00007AJG2", "B00AEFYWQY", "B0006GANOQ", "B0026JI1R2", "B0045HCJJ4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0780628306", "6306012419", "6305428425", "B000059XV6"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 74539}, "asin": "B0000541TK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P1C3SVKML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Beautiful"}

{"description": "It's a good thing Sandra Bullock knows her strengths and weaknesses, because without Bullock as star and producer,Miss Congenialitywould be an insufferable mess as opposed to being a mildly enjoyable trifle that is custom-made for Bullock's established screen persona. Only Bullock's fans could really appreciate this fluff (even then they'll wish its ripe premise had been more intelligently handled), but it's not without some highlights to accompany Bullock's reliable charms. Here she plays clumsy, nerdy FBI agent Gracie Hart, who is given the horrific pseudonym Gracie Lou Freebush (one example of the movie's juvenile tendencies) when assigned to infiltrate a beauty pageant to investigate threats of a terrorist attack.Transforming Bullock from frumpy to stunning is a piece of cake (although she gives pageant coach Michael Caine a run for his money), so the movie's premise is trivial at best. More enjoyable is her character's uncouth disdain for pageant contestants and her mistaken perception that they're all a bunch of bimbos. The movie nicely charts Gracie's realization that her own pageant makeover provides a much-needed ego boost. In addition to Caine's effortless scene-stealing, pageant host William Shatner and organizer Candice Bergen are smart choices for comedic support (Shatner's a perfect Bert Parks wannabe), but the movie desperately needs a credible foundation for its comedy to really pay off. Bullock's bureau boss (Benjamin Bratt) is an unconvincing dimwit, and none of the plotting is as smart as sayBeverly Hills Copin combining procedure with laughs. That leaves Bullock to carry the burden of a comedy that just barely works in her favor.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009KA2OA", "B00005O5CM", "B00005JM55", "6304765266", "B002K0WBXW", "B00081U7HC", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B00003CXSM", "B00006ZXSL", "B00008NRI7", "B002VECM6S", "B00007E2F5", "B0006GANOQ", "B00AEBB8NS", "B00003CXMP", "B0000524E5", "B00AEFY99O", "B00006FMUW", "B000HEWEE4", "B002NZK5V4", "B000YDBPAM", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00AEBB8R4", "B000CEV3M8", "B002O3Z50G", "B004SEUJK0", "B000J4QW7W", "B00E8RKHWW", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B00AEFYM2S", "B000209KMW", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00006ZXSK", "B0045HCJJ4", "B00447L4KA", "B00AMEZDJW", "B00008WJD6", "B0000897EG", "B000QUU4LY", "B000MQC9H4", "B00AEFXYOA", "B0000DIXDR", "B000XT1P3E", "0800177258", "0783225504", "B000NA1WE0", "6305236569", "B000023VTP", "B000FO0A9W", "B002SYAGNC", "B001ECDVK4", "B00003CXFV", "B00AEFYF2K", "B000J103OI", "B00005JG6N", "B0036TGSIK", "B00466HN7M", "B00000G3PA", "B0000AOV4I", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFY5TI", "B0015I2RT8", "B001ECDVJU", "B004SIP8JI", "B00005KAQP", "B000ELJAEM", "B0049TC88U", "B002NZK5UU", "B00006ZXSQ", "B00008G8M4", "B004SIP9RO", "6305212112", "B000A343RI", "B004SIP9X8", "0783225733", "6302077818", "B002GHHHP6", "B002GIBVWA", "B00AEBB9WI", "0800141806", "B000683VI4", "B00795C5X4", "B002NZK5RS", "B00003CXTA", "B000JYW5BE", "B00005JM9Q", "B004EPZ070", "B00AEFXZJE", "B003L20IHE", "B007L6VMDK", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00386EZKE", "B000CCBCAI", "B00007BKVC", "0783235070", "B00AEFXWXI", "B000CEV3KU", "B00005BCKF", "B00AEBB8YW", "B0006N2EZ0"], "bought_together": ["B00005O5CM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000NA1WE0", "B003PIUIJC", "6304765266", "B00005O5CM"]}, "price": 9.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 77252}, "asin": "B00005AAA9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514V9KPFJRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Miss Congeniality"}
{"description": "\"Only the gods see everything,\" cautions one scientist as Dr. James Xavier (Ray Milland) experiments with a formula that will allow the human eye to see beyond the wavelength of visible light. \"I am closing in on the gods,\" he responds with the hubris that is doomed to destroy his overreaching ambition. A mix of Greek tragedy and sci-fi potboiler, Roger Corman'sX: The Man with the X-Ray Eyes(simply identified asXin the eerie, odd opening credits) is a familiar tale of a scientist who risks everything to explore the unknown and is finally driven mad by, literally, seeing too much. Peeping through the clothes of comely women is all good adolescent fun until the gift becomes a nightmare as his sight rages out of control. The possibilities suggested in the hints of addiction and inconsistent bouts of megalomania remain tantalizingly unexplored in the unfocused script, and Corman's cut-rate special effects are often more hokey than haunting (the \"city dissolved in an acid of light\" that Xavier poetically describes becomes fuzzy photography through a series of color filters). Don Rickles offers a venal turn as a scheming carnival barker turned blackmailing con man, and Diana Van der Vlis is understanding as a sympathetic scientist who tries to rescue Xavier from his spiral into tortured madness, but in the tradition of Greek tragedy, he is doomed to be destroyed by the very gifts he desires.MGM's widescreen disc also features commentary by director-producer Corman.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305772142", "B00005AUK2", "B00D9EJFZA", "B001BSBBNK", "B00005R1O7", "B00465I1BK", "B0007R4T26", "B00518A70E", "B00D9EJFV4", "6305944288", "B0007R4T1C", "B00009PY4A", "B0000549B1", "B004QF71ZW", "6305869367", "B000063UR0", "B00D3DJH7S", "B0002V7O2Y", "B00009PY45", "B000UDGOBG", "6305761078", "B00DOZNGC2", "B000G28GHG", "B000EHSVJG", "B000FVQLKW", "B000OHZJGO", "B00DOZNI8Y", "B000059PPL", "B00023P4FQ", "B000AQKU72", "B001DQH91I", "B0007R4T3A", "B007Y1NNAW", "B00AEBB94G", "B0000542CN", "B000UAFDR0", "B000056NWI", "B00009PY4D", "B00DZP1C9K", "B0007R4SZY", "B003J216K4", "B00005O071", "B0002IQL8K", "B00027JYMG", "B00AEBB8VK", "B00AQ6J5YA", "0792846885", "B0009X770O", "B000AYELJ2", "B00JEZWRE4", "B00358MG8S", "B0016B6ZJW", "B000RXVNDI", "B0000648YD", "B005ETANC2", "B00000K3U3", "B0009X770E", "B0013XZ6SY", "B0000558NJ", "B00B2M7DKA", "B004QF71YS", "B000GRUQJW", "B00005K3OF", "B00005LC4K", "B00008973H", "B000RXVND8", "B00ITZXDDY", "B00CUKTHES", "B000T5O46C", "B00FGAKEEQ", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B005HIBWBG", "B0034PWPHY", "B000RXVNCY", "B003XF1VUC", "B00005LC4J", "B00J2PQYY0", "B005TMXXX0", "6305772711", "B0024FAG80", "B000O78KWE", "B001DB6J50", "B001BSBBIA", "6305869359", "B0007R4TR6", "B0024FAG2G", "B000EHSVJ6", "B00005NSXY", "B0007R4T08", "B000068TPE", "B002TSAAS8", "B0000694WH", "B00005K3O5", "B00CLIAACC", "B00AQ6J4XM", "B001AD54NE", "B00AEFXRWO", "B0045HCJ94", "B000B7MX7A", "B001B1Q3LM"], "bought_together": ["B00005AUK2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0016J5E5K", "6305772142", "B00D9EJFZA", "B00518A70E"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 114855}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.88, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005AUK1", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DR4WYBRPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "X - The Man With The X-Ray Eyes"}

{"description": "The premise ofLove Potion #9--that a magic potion makes the user irresistible to the opposite sex--could be the setup for the crassest sex farce imaginable. Instead, this film is a surprisingly subtle romantic comedy. Nebbishy scientist Paul (Tate Donovan) goes to a Gypsy fortuneteller (Anne Bancroft), who tells him she sees no women in his entire life. To make up for this depressing news, she gives him a few drops of a love potion--number 8. Paul, a biochemist, scoffs; but when his pet cat accidentally gets a taste and attracts every female cat in the neighborhood, he enlists fellow dweeby scientist Diane (Sandra Bullock) to analyze it. After experimenting on monkeys, they decide to test it on themselves; soon Diane is being pursued by handsome Italians in the street and comes close to marrying the Prince of England, while Paul gets a little revenge on a woman who previously rejected him, then embarks on his own love spree. Shortly they discover that they really want each other; but before they can get married, an old boyfriend of Diane returns with his own dose of love potion number 8. Paul's only hope is to get something even more powerful.Love Potion #9is genuinely clever and sweet, and both Donovan and Bullock work well with the low-key but effective humor of the movie's well-written script. It's a tribute to her talent and her girl-next-door looks that Bullock, unlike most pretty stars dressing down, is effective as both a lovelorn loser and the confident glamour-girl she becomes. Altogether, a charming and enjoyable film.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783235380", "6305736685", "B000CEV3M8", "B00465I16K", "B00068GTK6", "B00000JGHN", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B002SYAGNC", "6305874867", "6304765266", "B002NZK5V4", "B00006ZXSQ", "B0000640RY", "B00008G6E8", "B00004UEDQ", "B003PIUIJC", "B00008NRI7", "B0002IQLHQ", "B005FH1RRI", "B002K0WBXW", "B000M341SC", "B0077ATSSQ", "B0006GANOQ", "B000QGDY0G", "B002NZK5VO", "B000CCBCHG", "B000HEWEE4", "B00FQRZ6EM", "B002NZK5RS", "0783225482", "B0045HCJGC", "B000NA1WE0", "B000GB5M3S", "B000058TLQ", "B00E8RKHWW", "B0032XNKY0", "B00006ZXSL", "B0001GF24M", "6305236569", "B00HLSW6II", "B000HLDFK4", "B0047685GO", "B00008G7UF", "B000A3XY5A", "B00DMDE02Q", "B001M5M6XG", "B002ZG989G", "B0002B15X8", "B0007PLLBU", "B006GL8MQQ", "6305213283", "B0000A2ZO0", "6305133468", "B00015YVD6", "B002SYAGN2", "B0045HCJRG", "6305428395", "B0002I84N0", "B002NZK5UU", "B00AEBB8NS", "B000EXDRLW", "B002XUBDRY", "078322740X", "B00006ZXSO", "B0012RWQJ8", "B00AEFXYOA", "B00AEBB9WI", "B000ICLRHK", "B000N60H9U", "B004LWZW9C", "B00AEBB8YW", "B0000AYGBF", "B002P413IC", "B002ZG9968", "B000067J1O", "B0009KA2OA", "B00GSTHC7G", "B00008G7UM", "B0077ATSZE", "B004SIP9RO", "B005HWAOP2", "B0021L8UZS", "B00000JMOD", "B00H83EUQW", "B009INAK8C", "B000065V3E", "B004XQO8VO", "B0000714BW", "B0009OL7Z4", "B002AS464Q", "B001AEF6C2", "B0001IN0S0", "B002VECM6S", "B00005R5GA", "B00008G7UI", "B000KJU13C", "B0007IO6NM", "B00013WWT8", "0792844866", "B000QGDYZQ"], "bought_together": ["B000CEV3M8", "6304765266"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000G6BLJW", "6304765266", "B000CEV3M8", "B002SYAGNC"]}, "price": 29.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 141339}, "asin": "B00005B209", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J69QEGSSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Love Potion #9"}
{"description": "Islam: Empire of Faithis the epic PBS documentary that charts the history of Islam from its beginnings in Mecca and Medina in the seventh century to the glory of the Ottoman Empire 1,000 years later.The demonization of Islam by the West has a long history, stretching back to the First Crusade at the end of the 11th century. This documentary redresses the balance by showing the riches of Islamic culture and the vital role played by Islam in preserving and building upon ancient wisdom from East and West at a time when most of Europe was stumbling through the Dark Ages. Muslim physicians, mathematicians, and astronomers stretched the boundaries of human knowledge, and Muslim architects created some of the most beautiful buildings in the world.Islamalso offers fascinating insights into key personalities, from Muhammad himself--a simple merchant whose vision of a single deity forged warring tribes into a nation--to great conquerors such as Mehmed and Suleyman, who presided over an empire that stretched from Spain to India. The faith itself is clearly explained, and interviews with historians and religious scholars bring home both its simplicity and the way that it survived huge cultural changes (like the Mongol invasions of the 13th century) to emerge stronger than ever. Islam has often been misunderstood in the West, but this splendid documentary helps to set the record straight.--Simon Leake< />", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 404172}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 16.0, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005I9P1", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TNZ6S3WFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Islam - Empire Of Faith [VHS]"}

{"description": "Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) is a super (and super sexy) spy, fighting nefarious villains and working for the good guys--or so she thinks. Recruited as a college freshman for espionage work, Sydney found her true calling with SD-6, a secret division of the CIA. When her hunky doctor-boyfriend proposes to her, she decides to let him in on the truth she's not supposed to tell anyone: she's not a grad student with a demanding job for an international bank, but a secret agent who constantly puts her life on the line for the free world. But when SD-6 discovers her security breach, her fianc&#xE9; is brutally assassinated, and Sydney suddenly finds herself face-to-face with the truth: she's been working for the bad guys. Deciding to become a double agent for the CIA and bring down the evildoers, Sydney gets one more surprise--her estranged father (Victor Garber) is also working for SD-6, and the CIA as well. Welcome to the family, Syd!Confusing? This is all just in the first episode ofAlias, the brainchild ofFelicitycreator J.J. Abrams that plays like a cross betweenBuffy the Vampire SlayerandJames Bond. With its double-edged tension (how long can Syd play double agent?) and one heck of a MacGuffin (the dreaded Rambaldi device, the mythic creation of a Renaissance genius), the show leads its viewers from episode to episode with visceral, compelling action, not to mention the nascent romance between Syd and her CIA handler, Vaughn (Michael Vartan), and her clashes with her heretofore distant father. Sharp, smart, and always suspenseful,Alias' center was held by the gorgeous Garner, a stellar action heroine and an even better actress who could pull off Sydney's exotic undercover missions and conflicted emotions with equal dexterity. By the end of this first season, which concludes with a breathtaking cliffhanger, you'll be seduced intoAlias' world with, happily, no desire to escape.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001MVWRNO", "B001MVWRMK", "B001MVWRMU", "B001MVWRN4", "B0001I55ZQ", "B004SJU51I", "B00008ZL4Q", "B0047BXR8U", "B000O77SMW", "B000O77SN6", "B0006UEVTK", "B003R4ZMQI", "B0047BXR9E", "B00GTZWUPS", "B0047BXR30", "B003UD7JEE", "B00005JNOG", "B000FFJYBQ", "B000TGURZ8", "B005FISC3Y", "B000FIMG68", "B0079IEPHK", "B000NDEXK2", "B00A8KJN8M", "B00HUPC5X8", "B006YG9HJE", "B00C57OVUQ", "B00H57HOSC", "B0009X76ZA", "B0007P0Y7C", "B0018CWEYY", "B000P6YNSE", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B0015RRNMA", "B000092T3Y", "B009LDD4V4", "B002DQSKME", "B00JF5GAZA", "B00079FUI6", "B003R0MEXQ", "B0051GOB2G", "B00BD6KXKW", "B0012CJQYG", "B0077PTWHI", "B007PKSO2Y", "B00133QNS6", "B003R0MEZO", "B000R7HRRA", "B00062IDEW", "B000MR8W92", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B00E8OMZGG", "B0018CWEZI", "B00170LCWC", "B000QFCDAO", "B009LDD1H6", "B0036EH3XE", "B001L5SRJE", "B000BZISRQ", "B000EXDS3E", "B0030VANIU", "B002KQ6UE2", "B0018CWEVW", "B000TM1CL0", "B00IWTVDUW", "B0060MYLCU", "B0077PTWY6", "B00080ZG2O", "0553375970", "B0058JEHTS", "B0053O8A46", "B00B5ARKC0", "B00BGQ2NIO", "B0002DRE72", "B000FL7CAK", "B00008972G", "B001QE99BA", "B001VPJZ0E", "B001C8W7EQ", "B000ICLRKC", "B0024FAR66", "B00008YGRU", "B001B7CNZ6", "B001AQMBKA", "B002JVWRD6", "B001VPJYZU", "B000EXDS34", "B003L77G2Y", "B0019LY5IM", "B00B58948U", "B00915G6TE", "B000FIMG4U", "B00EIXWMII", "B0001907BC", "B0058YPJ8G", "B000EXDS3Y", "B003F3NE7K", "B002JVWR4U", "B000AQ68SC", "B000SQFC2C"], "bought_together": ["B001MVWRNO", "B001MVWRMK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001MVWRN4", "B001MVWRNO", "B001MVWRMU", "B002NS2HBM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 139345}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 24.25, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JLF1", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CTQ5VQ5AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Alias - The Complete First Season"}
{"description": "A Beautiful Mindmanages to twist enough pathos out of John Nash's incredible life story to redeem an at-times goofy portrayal of schizophrenia. Russell Crowe tackles the role with characteristic fervor, playing the Nobel prize-winning mathematician from his days at Princeton, where he developed a groundbreaking economic theory, to his meteoric rise to the cover ofForbesmagazine and an MIT professorship, and on through to his eventual dismissal due to schizophrenic delusions. Of course, it is the delusions that fascinate director Ron Howard and, predictably, go astray. Nash's other world, populated as it is by a maniacal Department of Defense agent (Ed Harris), an imagined college roommate who seems straight out ofDead Poets Society, and an orphaned girl, is so fluid and scriptlike as to make the viewer wonder if schizophrenia is really as slick as depicted. Crowe's physical intensity drags us along as he works admirably to carry the film on his considerable shoulders. No doubt the story of Nash's amazing will to recover his life without the aid of medication is a worthy one, his eventual triumph heartening. Unfortunately, Howard's flashy style is unable to convey much of it.--Fionn Meade", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SIP7ZS", "B0043X1FL8", "B004FQX5B6", "B00AEFZ63M", "B0000YEEGM", "B00003CWQR", "B000ARTN3I", "B000EHQU0S", "6305144168", "0767811100", "B000066HAS", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEFYSWM", "B0002B15ZG", "1451628420", "B00000IQV7", "B000021Y7L", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFY5B6", "B003ASLJQI", "B000XJD3JI", "B004SUDQ22", "B004U7MR1Y", "B00A81MV3U", "B0043X1FM2", "B00B0U2SFE", "B002NZK5UK", "B000N6U0E2", "B003B3NGS6", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00004RJ73", "B00003CWRX", "B00125WAWS", "B00005JLSB", "6305428352", "B00008EY60", "0800141806", "B00001ZWUS", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEBB9CS", "6304712936", "0780619587", "B00007GZR5", "B000YAF4MA", "B000KX0IOA", "B004SIP8W0", "B00080ZG10", "B00B9LNPA6", "0783225733", "B003U0AHBO", "B00004BZIY", "B00005JND5", "B000E33VWW", "B003NF97NK", "B0038M2AZA", "B002CPMB9O", "B000P0J0EM", "B000A3XY5A", "B00AFEXRME", "B00005Q4CS", "B000LC55F2", "B00AEBB9SM", "B0006FYOTC", "B000056VP4", "B002WNU0QW", "B000RTB0R6", "0684819066", "B00003CXZ4", "B00AEFY17E", "B000EGDB10", "B002VECM6S", "B002ZG980U", "B001P9KR8U", "B001N44BVQ", "B000LP6KNU", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0002V7ON8", "B0018CWW5K", "B00JPQ1INI", "B0030Y12FU", "B003ELKNH2", "B000K2UGZM", "B00121QGPY", "B0001CNRAM", "B00003CXFV", "0783223609", "B007N31YH0", "B002HK9IDQ", "B005BYBZEK", "B000JJ5F8O", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B003UESJHO", "B00A7MSQSO", "B004SIP9U6", "B00005JL78", "B00012QLB4", "B003UESJH4", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000K7VHQE"], "bought_together": ["B004SIP7ZS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00C7MW5EI", "B004SIP7ZS", "B001F34HRS", "B00001ZWUS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3605}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.99, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

{"description": "With its disturbing images and a few good shocks,The Ringis the kind of frightfest you'll watch to set a chilling mood or spook your susceptible friends, but when you try to sort it out, this well-mounted American remake (of the 1998 Japanese hitRingu, based on Koji Suzuki's popular novel) becomes a batch of incoherent parts. The negligible plot follows a Seattle reporter (Naomi Watts) as she investigates the death of her niece, the victim of a mysterious videotape that, according to urban legend, causes the viewer's death seven days later.

Will Lightman (Grant) is a good-looking, smooth-talking bachelor whose primary goal in life is avoiding any kind of responsibility. But when he invents an imaginary son in order to meet attractive single moms, Will gets a hilarious lesson about life from a bright, but hopelessly geeky 12-year-old named Marcus. Now, as Will struggles to teach Marcus the art of being cool, Marcus teaches Will that you're never too old to grow up.

{"description": "Even though it's only a single disc, the28 Days LaterDVD includes a lot of very interesting features, including the alternate ending that was shown after the end of the film a couple months into its theatrical run.  It's much bleaker, as director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland say in their optional commentary.  Another alternate ending is almost the same as the theatrical ending but slightly less happy.  Most interesting is the \"radical\" alternate ending that takes an entirely different path midway through the film.  It wasn't filmed, however, so Boyle and Garland narrate the action over storyboards, and it's a surprisingly engrossing 11 minutes.  Boyle and Garland also did a commentary track for the film, and they talk about how they were able to get the shots of deserted London and why they used the ending they did.  There are also six very watchable deleted scenes, and Boyle and Garland's comments range from \"great sequence\" to \"a disgrace.\" Slightly less relevant is a 24-minute documentary that spends its first 10 minutes on the real-life threat of infectious diseases before recapping the film and discussing such elements as the use of digital video and the boot camp the actors had to attend. If you need any further proof that the DVD was a labor of love, even the stills galleries have commentaries.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000TJBN80", "B0002ABURA", "B0006A9FKA", "B002WY65VU", "B00111YM5Q", "B0013D8LAE", "B000IHY9TS", "B000Y7U98C", "B00005JO16", "B0021L8UXA", "B0001611DI", "B0013D8LA4", "B000RJO56O", "B002JT69IW", "B001D2WU9I", "B002VWNIDG", "B0002CHK1S", "B00D7AM6M0", "B003UGLCIA", "B00AEFYYH6", "B001MVYUR0", "B000UAE7O0", "B003EYVXYG", "B000EHRVP6", "B0028DRGDQ", "B0021L8UPS", "B001NPD9LS", "B005LAIIMG", "B000FAOC2W", "B000LP6KNU", "B0006SSOHC", "B000WC3864", "B0013FDM7E", "B00000K3TO", "B000RIWAVW", "B000GCFO0I", "B000O76ZQC", "B004LWZW24", "B000RJO578", "B002VKB0KG", "B006ISJR7U", "B00004TS0G", "B004SIP9MY", "B002VKE1K2", "B00G5GNYY2", "B000N6TX1I", "B0024FADD8", "B005QUQRBU", "B001MYIXAC", "B00D3DJIG8", "B001GUYB08", "B000TGJ80S", "B000V4UFZK", "B004SIP92O", "B00009MGEM", "B0010X73ZG", "B00005K3NR", "B002LMSWN2", "B000063RQQ", "B00000ILDD", "B004BZ5AN2", "0767802519", "B00001QGUM", "B00AJLHUA8", "B002SJIO4A", "B00005JMUA", "B00J5LXT6M", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B000AXWHSA", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00005JLWN", "B004BLJQOK", "B0015ET3YO", "B008220BLG", "B000031WD9", "B000069HZP", "B000EQ5SRK", "B0007Y08QA", "B000PMLJMQ", "B000BUNZY2", "B002ZG98UA", "B000V4UH08", "B001JNNDJM", "B003HKN52U", "B003UAKEBW", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0019X3YX2", "B00CE00ZV8", "B00003CXCF", "B0009WFEDC", "B000FS9FE4", "B00005JNJV", "B00011CZRE", "B002T9H2LA", "B000RW5BZ0", "B00005JMXX", "B000WC389G", "B007STBUHI", "B002ZG983M"], "bought_together": ["B000TJBN80", "B002WY65VU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008SAPC20", "B003J42JLC", "B000Y7U98C", "B0002ABURA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 37382}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.25, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00005JMA8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511KHM89SFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "28 Days Later (Widescreen Special Edition)"}

{"description": "WithInfernal Affairs, Hong Kong filmmakers Wai Keung Lau and Siu Fai Mak have successfully taken a smart script and a great cast, added some stylistic cinematography, and dual-fistedly given a new twist to a formulaic genre.  Lau Kin Ming (Andy Lau), a young, loyal gangster, is ordered by his Triad boss Sam (Eric Tsang) to join the police force. While on the inside the young mole can keep a close eye on police activity, ensuring the gang's activities will not be interrupted. Police Superintendent Wong (Anthony Wong Chau-Sang) has a similar plan. He takes a bright, ambitious police cadet Yan (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) and makes him an undercover cop with plans to get him inside the Triads.  Years pass and both are now deep into their assigned roles. Undercover cop Yan, more or less living the life of a gangster, is now a member of Boss Sam's group, and \"Officer\" Lau has all the appearance of a good cop trying to bust up the Triads' drug ring. During a bust that could finally bring down Boss Sam, the moles inadvertently become aware of each other's existence, and each is left wondering who is on the inside. What follows is a unique and exciting twist on the classic cat and mouse chase in which each man is not fighting for his life, but for his anonymity. In addition to its plot twists, what liftsInfernal Affairsabove the standard cop story is its subtle exploration of the relative nature of good and evil. Part action, part psychological examination,Infernal Affairsis a sharp and fresh take on the classic crime story, and the inspiration for a 2006 Martin Scorsese remake (The Departed). Not to be missed.--Rob Bracco", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000KX0IMC", "B000KX0IMM", "B000N4SHNK", "B0004Z302Q", "B0036BDQBU", "B00B6OEE7O", "B004H2CXBQ", "6305972532", "B000R7HXZQ", "B0009S2T0M", "B005ZMBEXU", "B00HSJ2EMI", "B000065V38", "B00C6WHPO4", "B000HC2M3Y", "B005HG8VE4", "B000GFLKDU", "B00J5LXST0", "B004SIP88Y", "B0018PH3NS", "B0010X7432", "B008XEZXES", "B0007Q6VXC", "B000R7HY2I", "B00003CXUM", "B004SIP6GI", "B003EVAG4C", "B000M341QE", "B000UAE7M2", "B001MYIXAC", "B00J5LXQKQ", "B0030A6ICG", "B00ET2ODYY", "B002C6VMIY", "B00AN5LCV8", "B00008R9LX", "B001F0TM3A", "B005FQ1OOK", "B000WGZGOC", "B000KX0IMW", "B006C1S1DY", "B000BRBA8S", "B000NVT0RK", "B00005JKG1", "B003INBNXO", "B000I0RNWU", "B000GSYRY6", "B0013D8LCM", "B005F96UGO", "B001O7SWHG", "B0010X741O", "B000MM0LEG", "B0085A9J18", "B00DSQTMRA", "B0056OZI0W", "B00C3ALL9O", "B000MM0LF0", "B00004W457", "B008WAM36O", "B00H47IXJW", "B0036TGSJE", "B00CG0YLS4", "B004I1AGTC", "B006L4MWVE", "B00003CXR4", "B0019PL2W0", "B00AN5LCOA", "B00006ADES", "B0010SAGHS", "B0010X740K", "B0009XRZQK", "B00002RAPT", "B000EE3FUY", "B009VL2AZM", "B003G715IK", "B00G3HOJZ6", "B009VL2A5M", "B0087OULO6", "B005F96UHI", "B000006A17", "B008U1ANCG", "B002ZPIBRC", "B00ENTX7JU", "B001BEK8E2", "B0076XTIWU", "B008IG0B0C", "B000Q7ZKWK", "B0056OZI0M", "B00AWHDEIQ", "B00BTFK014", "B00005YUNV", "B000E0OE44", "B003DVB7F0", "B002P7UCJK", "B005ZMBEXA", "B005M9VSMI", "6305081034", "B0040QYRTA", "B00772HQTC", "B0058M0848"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000N4SHNK", "B0036BDQBU", "B0085A9J18", "B004H2CXBQ"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 112979}, "asin": "B00005JN7C", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YGGXV9AJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Infernal Affairs (Wu jian dao)"}

{"description": "Batman Beginsdiscards the previous four films in the series and recasts the Caped Crusader as a fearsome avenging angel. That's good news, because the series, which had gotten off to a rousing start under Tim Burton, had gradually dissolved into self-parody by 1997'sBatman & Robin. As the title implies,Batman Beginstells the story anew, when Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) flees Western civilization following the murder of his parents. He is taken in by a mysterious instructor named Ducard (Liam Neeson in another mentor role) and urged to become a ninja in the League of Shadows, but he instead returns to his native Gotham City resolved to end the mob rule that is strangling it. But are there forces even more sinister at hand?Cowritten by the team of David S. Goyer (a veteran comic book writer) and director Christopher Nolan (Memento),Batman Beginsis a welcome return to the grim and gritty version of the Dark Knight, owing a great debt to the graphic novels that preceded it. It doesn't have the razzle dazzle, or the mass appeal, ofSpider-Man 2(though the Batmobile is cool), and retelling the origin means it starts slowly, like most \"first\" superhero movies. But it's certainly the best Bat-film since Burton's original, and one of the best superhero movies of its time. Bale cuts a good figure as Batman, intense and dangerous but with some of the lightheartedness Michael Keaton brought to the character. Michael Caine provides much of the film's humor as the family butler, Alfred, and as the love interest, Katie Holmes (Dawson's Creek) is surprisingly believable in her first adult role. Also featuring Gary Oldman as the young police officer Jim Gordon, Morgan Freeman as a Q-like gadgets expert, and Cillian Murphy as the vile Jonathan Crane.--David HoriuchiBatmanat Amazon.comAllBatmanDVDsBatman Begins101: A Comic Book PrimerWhere Have I Seen Christian Bale?AllBatmanComics and Graphic NovelsBatmanToysBatman BeginsSoundtrackStills fromBatman Begins(click for larger images)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA", "B002GSXKN8", "B000P0J06U", "B001OST0LW", "B000P0J06K", "B004EPZ07K", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00005JKCH", "B001GCUO1Q", "B002ZG980U", "B001OST0M6", "B008JFUPFI", "B004LWZWFQ", "B00005JMQW", "B004LWZW42", "B000VI70QS", "B001DHXT20", "B000M341QE", "B0000959N0", "B000UR9T8C", "B00005JNTU", "B000AYELVA", "B00E5I2M6I", "B002IPFWTE", "B000HEVZ9E", "B0090SI56Y", "B002HWRYJE", "B0006L0LOS", "B000OVLBF8", "B00003CWT6", "B000VR0570", "B00E5I2MEK", "B000HCO83Q", "B0007P0Y7C", "B008JFUO72", "B00F4FFO8E", "B001CDR1FG", "B000P0J0EW", "B002T9H2LA", "B0002KVUKM", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00005N5S5", "B0083SBMBM", "B0001BKAEY", "B00AQSN7HE", "B000J10EQU", "B00005JKZY", "B002NXSRVG", "B000AYELVU", "B001OQCV6A", "B004LWZW4M", "B001VLBDD0", "B001GZ6QEC", "B004GJYRA0", "B007REV4T8", "B001TK80C0", "B000HRJLII", "B001QTXM5Y", "B005G4TJUC", "B00005JKZV", "B0053FANT0", "B00005JA8B", "B003YAR97K", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00001ZWUS", "B004EPYZQC", "B001N44BVQ", "B006VRRGNK", "B001AEF6HM", "B00000JQB5", "B00011CZRE", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00AEFY0F2", "B007K3JFUQ", "B0002IQMAM", "B00005JN0T", "B002SJIO4A", "B000VWYJ86", "B0013FDM7E", "B00005JNTI", "B00407PNY2", "B00DTPRZ24", "B008JFUS0U", "B00004Z4WR", "B000FS9FCG", "B000QXDED6", "B0085A9HU6", "0780624890", "B00005LOUK", "B000065U1N", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005JN5T", "B001QB9H1U", "B00005JMUA", "0792844890", "B0007DFJ0G", "B004EPYZSK", "B008JFUOWM", "B00AEFY5B6"], "bought_together": ["B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009JBWOU0", "B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA", "B002ZG980U"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7806}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.99, "brand": "DC Comics", "asin": "B00005JNJV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518zjc4XtzL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Batman Begins (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "As paranoid cop Del Spooner, Will Smith (Independence Day,Men in Black) displays both his trademark quips and some impressive pectoral muscles inI, Robot. Only Spooner suspects that the robots that provide the near future with menial labor are going to turn on mankind--he's just not sure how. When a leading roboticist dies suspiciously, Spooner pursues a trail that may prove his suspicions. Don't expect much of a connection to Isaac Asimov's classic science fiction stories;I, Robot, the action movie, isn't prepared for any ruminations on the significance of artificial intelligence. This likable, efficient movie won't break any new ground, but it does have an idea or two to accompany its jolts and thrills, which puts it ahead of most recent action flicks. Also featuring Bridget Moynahan (The Sum of All Fears), Bruce Greenwood (The Sweet Hereafter), and James Cromwell (Babe,LA Confidential).--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0013FDM7E", "B0013J55B6", "B005LAIGPA", "B00005JL78", "B00008G8M4", "B005LAIHXQ", "B00003CXXP", "B004AOECXI", "B00005JMXX", "B005LAIHYU", "6305428115", "B0049IHX2C", "B004LWZW9W", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B0067EKYAY", "B005LAIIHG", "B00177YA1K", "B001QERPAC", "B002ZG980U", "630587493X", "B000VG66XS", "B000N6U0E2", "B00005JKWX", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B000957O82", "B004LWZW4M", "B004UXUX4Q", "B00DV2MVWO", "B005LAIGRS", "B0000844I8", "B004LWZW8I", "B002ZG997C", "B00AEFXPSK", "B000AP04FG", "B008MIMWQW", "B006TTC5PY", "B00070FX5U", "B00081912E", "B0009MDPYM", "B00005JNTU", "0553294385", "B004XQO90O", "B00CWM58WY", "B001L57ZYM", "B00E8RKHWW", "B00005JPD0", "B00AEBB86A", "B007REV4T8", "B000FFL2G6", "B00005JL3K", "B001TODCII", "B00AEFXCLU", "B003UYUQZW", "B00000G3PA", "B0001NBNDY", "6305767866", "B0002V7OI8", "B000GFLKF8", "B003Q6D2B4", "B00005JKMQ", "B0000B1OFL", "B00AAQHP66", "055338256X", "B0000ACOXL", "B0090SI56Y", "0783225733", "B00AEFZ2DG", "B00003CWU3", "B00BB67UNW", "B00005JN0W", "B00005JNQS", "B00AEFYCW8", "B001GZ6QC4", "B0002KVUKM", "B00561BNI6", "B002GOAH1A", "B000GBEWHK", "B0000959N0", "B002I9Z8EO", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B00005JMZK", "B001OQCV2E", "B00004Z4WR", "B002O3Z510", "B000JYW5BE", "B000FS9FCG", "B00005JNTI", "B00BTYOYG2", "B002SG7Z7A", "B00A7MSQRK", "B000AYELVA", "B002ZG98LO", "B000ENC5YW", "0783240295", "B002GHHHME", "B005LAII3A", "B0045HCJ9O", "B00LG6YEKE", "B002NXSRVG", "B00004BZIY"], "bought_together": ["B004AOECXI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AZMFJYA", "B002SG7Z7A", "B00005JA8B", "B0087ZG7HK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8757}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00005JN0T", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513MNJSY0FL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "I, Robot (Widescreen Edition)"}

Thank goodness it didn't make the final cut! Pollack makes a passionate plea for keeping the widescreen aspect for home video.

{"description": "Opposites are forced to attract inAlong Came Polly, a dose of featherweight fluff that could've been better and could've been worse--surely no pairing of Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston can be a complete waste of time, right? Faint praise indeed, but fans of these mainstream funny-folk will enjoy this movie as a lazy-weekend distraction. Ben's a newlywed insurance risk-assessment analyst whose wife (Debra Messing, in a throwaway role) betrays him on their honeymoon. His uptight, play-it-safe lifestyle (which includes acute aversion to germs and irritable bowel syndrome) makes him seemingly incompatible with the spontaneous, free-spirited Polly (Aniston), but writer-director John Hamburg (whose writing credits include the previous Stiller hitsMeet the ParentsandZoolander) is determined to give them at least theappearanceof romantic potential. No such luck.

{"description": "In the DVD world, the Criterion Collection label generally indicates that you'll be getting your money's worth on the extras, andThe Life Aquatic with Steve Zissouis no exception. These two discs contain many features that fans of the film will expect: Seu Jorge performing David Bowie songs (complete versions), many documentary scenes of writer-director Wes Anderson at work, interviews with cast members including Cate Blanchett, Bill Murray, etc. Other extras are a little more confusing. For instance, does Seymour Cassel, who plays Zissou's deceased partner, know what he's doing when he complains to a hairless cigar merchant about having to go faux bald? And what's the deal withMondo Monda? It's a cringingly awkward Italian talk show in which the host (also an actor in the film) interviews the screenwriters, throwing out references so random and esoteric that even smart guys like Anderson and Noah Baumbach are left speechless. It's all a joke, right? In the end, the bonus material accomplishes its primary goal: get those who already enjoy the film to like it just a little bit more.--Leah Weathersby", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0010X8NF0", "6305428239", "B0000640VJ", "0767821408", "B007L6VR12", "B001QOGYBI", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B007L6VR6M", "B000CS464G", "B0006TPE4C", "081099741X", "B00005JMJ4", "B000934FC2", "B0035G5IOE", "B00JAQJNN0", "B00005JMJG", "B000BRD6T4", "B0045NXMJE", "B00007AJF8", "B00H9HZITU", "B0018BD9DA", "B004SEUIXS", "1623160510", "B001P3SA8K", "B000JMK6LW", "B0018O4YT0", "B001MM3AZM", "B0006H32EI", "B002E2M5IC", "B0012E2GFK", "B000M4RG7E", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000Y7U98C", "B001NPD9PY", "B00IJXJAIS", "B000A7DVR2", "B008MIMWP8", "B004FQX5B6", "B00GKOJ98E", "0783228457", "B000K7VHOG", "B002LMV7RA", "B00008RH3J", "B0009A40ES", "B00DL46ZN8", "0957490909", "B000F5GNX8", "B00005JLRE", "B00006AUIH", "B00005V9HH", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B001JIE7JM", "B000IU37SO", "B004RQDQIQ", "B00AEBB8SS", "B00006LPGP", "B00000K3TS", "B00H9L28OO", "B007D5E7C2", "B000065AI3", "B0033WH6MW", "B008220D5K", "B0014D5RBE", "B001BPJJ9G", "B00005JL78", "B007D0FVRM", "B00AEFYOJE", "B00003CXZ4", "6304493681", "B0083V2W4U", "B000Z8GZYW", "B008R65XNS", "0783229526", "B00HGGUTPW", "B003UESJMO", "B005HK13SG", "B000P0J0EW", "B002VWNIAY", "B000P0J0D8", "B004SIP7ZS", "B001HN69AY", "B003XURDAY", "B00H7KJRVY", "B00ECR7KX2", "B001GMAVGE", "B005LAIIJY", "B000055Y0X", "B0000AC8LR", "B000K7VHQE", "B00AEFYAMA", "6305922756", "B0041T52S6", "B009YQJ322", "B003CRM6PA", "B002T9H2LA", "B000O76ZQC", "B0040QYROA", "B005MYEQ4U", "B00I6JOD2S", "B00FZ4KR4U"], "bought_together": ["B0010X8NF0", "B0000640VJ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00JAQJMJ0", "B0010X8NF0", "B007L6VR12", "B0000640VJ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 72305}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.5, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JNLQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H5Q2VBE1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (The Criterion Collection)"}

{"description": "Movies don't come any bigger than Peter Jackson'sKing Kong, a three-hour remake of the 1933 classic that marries breathtaking visual prowess with a surprising emotional depth. Expanding on the original story of the blonde beauty and the beast who falls for her, Jackson creates a movie spectacle that matches hisLord of the Ringsfilms and even at times evokes their fantasy world while celebrating the glory of '30s Hollywood. Naomi Watts stars as Ann Darrow, a vaudeville actress down on her luck in Depression-era New York until manic filmmaker Carl Denham (a game but miscast Jack Black) entices her with a lead role. Dazzled by the genius of screenwriter Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody), Ann boards the tramp steamer S.S.Venture, which she--and most of the wary crew--believes is headed for Singapore. Denham, however, is in search of the mythic Skull Island, hoping to capture its wonders on film and make a fortune. What he didn't count on were some scary natives who find that the comely Darrow looks like prime sacrifice material for a mysterious giant creature....There's no point in rehashing the entire plot, as every movie aficionado is more than familiar with the trajectory ofKing Kong; the challenge facing Jackson, his screenwriters, and the phenomenal visual-effects team was to breathe new life into an old, familiar story. To that degree, they achieve what could be best called a qualified success. Though they've assembled a crackerjack supporting cast, including Thomas Kretschmann as theVenture's hard-bitten captain and young Jamie Bell as a plucky crewman, the first third of the movie is rather labored, with too much minute detail given over to sumptuous re-creations of '30s New York and the unexciting initial leg of theVenture's sea voyage. However, once the film finds its way to Skull Island (which bears more than a passing resemblance toLOTR's Mordor),Kongturns into a dazzling movie triumph, by turns terrifying and awe-inspiring. The choreography and execution of the action set pieces--including one involving Kong and a trio of Tyrannosaurus Rexes, as well as another that could be charitably described as a bug-phobic's nightmare--is nothing short of landmark filmmaking, and a certain Mr. Spielberg should watch his back, asKongtrumps most anything that has come before it.Despite the visual challenges ofKing Kong, the movie's most difficult hurdle is the budding romance between Ann and her simian soulmate. Happily, this is where Jackson unqualifiedly triumphs, as this unorthodox love story is tenderly and humorously drawn, by turns sympathetic and wondrous. Watts, whose accessibility balances out her almost otherworldly loveliness, works wonders with mere glances, and Andy Serkis, who digitally embodies Kong here much as he did Gollum in theLOTRfilms, breathes vibrant life into the giant star of the film without ever overplaying any emotions. The final, tragic act of the film, set mostly atop the Empire State Building, is whereKongearns its place in movie history as a work that celebrates both the technical and emotional heights that film can reach.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"bought_together": ["B000EHQTZO", "B00AEFYEU8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EHQTZO", "B00AEFYEU8", "B0087ZG7HK", "0767817478"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 32487}, "categories": [["Movies & TV"]], "price": 8.94, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JO20", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513Y54TGdwL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "King Kong (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Critics and controversy aside,The Da Vinci Codeis a verifiable blockbuster. Combine the film's huge worldwide box-office take with over 100 million copies of Dan Brown's book sold, andThe Da Vinci Codehas clearly made the leap from pop-culture hit to a certifiable franchise. The leap for any story making the move from book to big screen, however, is always more perilous. In the case ofThe Da Vinci Code, the plot is concocted of such a preposterous formula of elements that you wouldn&#x92;t envy screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, the man tasked with making this story filmable. The script followsDan Brown&#x92;s bookas closely as possible while incorporating a few needed changes, including a better ending. And if you&#x92;re like most of the world, by now you&#x92;ve read the book and know how it goes: while lecturing in Paris, noted Harvard Professor of Symbology Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is summoned to the Louvre by French police to help decipher a bizarre series of clues left at the scene of the murder of the chief curator. Enter Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), gifted cryptologist. Neveu and Langdon team up to solve the mystery, and from there the story is propelled across Europe, ballooning into a modern-day mini-quest for the Holy Grail, where secret societies are discovered, codes are broken, and murderous albino monks are thwarted&#x85; oh, and alternative theories about the life of Christ and the beginnings of Christianity are presented too, of course. It&#x92;s not the typical formula for a stock Hollywood thriller. In fact, taken solely as a mystery, the movie almost works--despite some gaping holes--mostly just because it keeps moving. Brown&#x92;s greatest trick was  to have the entire story take place in one day, so the action is forced to keep moving, despite some necessary pauses for exposition. As a screen couple, Hanks and Tautou are just fine together but not exactly memorable; meanwhile Sir Ian McKellen&#x92;s scenery-chewing as pivotal character Sir Leigh Teabing is just what the film needed to keep it from taking itself too seriously. The whole thing is like a good roller-coaster ride: try not to think too much about it--just sit back and enjoy the trip.--Daniel VanciniVisit The Da Vinci Code StoreOn The DVDThe DVD extras on a film as popular asThe Da Vinci Codeshould be plentiful, and this version doesn&#x92;t skimp. With over 90 minutes of special features, including ten behind-the-scenes featurettes, there&#x92;s a lot here to explore beyond the film itself. The question is, is there anything new here that we haven&#x92;t heard before, in all the hype, pseudo-documentaries, and controversy surrounding the movie, to make it worthwhile?  For most viewers, the answer will be \"yes.\" Essentially, if you like the movie, if you enjoyed the book, you will get a lot out of them.Just as the movie is intended to make the book come to life, the DVD extras should make the film come to life by pointing the audience into the world of the filmmakers, connecting the dots between print and film, and for the most part they do just that. The extras here range from the typical look behind-the-scenes to more in-depth features on the supporting characters, the locations, and theMona Lisaherself.  \"First Day on the Set with Ron Howard\" features the director gushing about the opportunity to film in the Louvre and work with Tom Hanks again (the two worked together before onSplashandApollo 13). It&#x92;s a short piece that doesn&#x92;t reveal much beyond making an attempt to share Howard&#x92;s excitement (with the \"Gee, I really loved working with him/her on this project\" that you hear in every such featurette), but viewers might enjoy seeing how the stage was set up in the famous museum, down to the spike tape on the floor showing actors where to hit their marks.The Filmmaking Experience, Parts 1 and 2further explores the creative and technical aspects of the filmmaking process.A Conversation with Dan Brownstarts out feeling like a puff-piece (the man who wrote this book got started at age 5 with a story calledThe Giraffe, The Pig, and the Pants on Fire. \"It was a thriller,\" he says.) and unfortunately it doesn&#x92;t go very deep into much of anything of interest. But on the other hand, this isn&#x92;t60 Minuteshere; it&#x92;s intended to give viewers a better sense of the man behind the franchise, which it does.  Much of the footage from this interview is sprinkled throughout some of the other featurettes. Meanwhile, the character behind the franchise, Robert Langdon, is examined in his own featurette, as is Sophie Neveu. The cool thing here is getting under the skin of the actors to see how they approached the characters, knowing that most of the movie-going public already has formed their own ideas about the characters from the book.The most interesting extras are the featurettes that focus on the history behind the mystery.

{"description": "Critically hailed as an instant classic, Clint Eastwood'sLetters from Iwo Jimais a masterwork of uncommon humanity and a harrowing, unforgettable indictment of the horrors of war. In an unprecedented demonstration of worldly citizenship, Eastwood (from a spare, tightly focused screenplay by first-time screenwriter Iris Yamashita) has crafted a truly Japanese film, with Japanese dialogue (with subtitles) and filmed in a contemplative Japanese style, serving as both complement and counterpoint to Eastwood's previously released companion filmFlags of Our Fathers. Where the earlier film employed a complex non-linear structure and epic-scale production values to dramatize one of the bloodiest battles of World War II and its traumatic impact on American soldiers,Lettersreveals the battle of Iwo Jima from the tunnel- and cave-dwelling perspective of the Japanese, hopelessly outnumbered, deprived of reinforcements, and doomed to die in inevitable defeat. While maintaining many of the traditions of the conventional war drama, Eastwood extends his sympathetic touch to humanize \"the enemy,\" revealing the internal and external conflicts of soldiers and officers alike, forced by circumstance to sacrifice themselves or defend their honor against insurmountable odds. From the weary reluctance of a young recruit named Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya) to the dignified yet desperately anguished strategy of Japanese commander Tadamichi Kuribayashi (played by Oscar-nominatedThe Last Samuraicostar Ken Watanabe), whose letters home inspired the film's title and present-day framing device,Letters from Iwo Jima(which conveys the bleakness of battle through a near-total absence of color) steadfastly avoids the glorification of war while paying honorable tribute to ill-fated men who can only dream of the comforts of home.--Jeff ShannonOn the DVDsLike the film itself, the two-disc special edition ofLetters from Iwo Jimais predominantly Japanese in content, and that's as it should be. Disc 1 presents the film in a  flawless widescreen transfer, with a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround soundtrack that perfectly captures the film's wide dynamic range. The optional subtitles can be turned off for those wishing to immerse themselves in a completely Japanese viewing experience. Disc 2 opens with \"Red Sun, Black Sand: The Making ofLetters from Iwo Jima,\" a 20-minute behind-the-scenes documentary that concisely covers all aspects of production, from director Clint Eastwood's initial decision to create a companion piece toFlags of Our Fathers, to interview comments from principal cast and crew, the latter includingFlagsscreenwriters Paul Haggis andLettersscreenwriter Iris Yamashita, costume designer Deborah Hopper, editor Joel Cox, cinematographer Tom Stern, production designer James Murakami (taking over for the ailing Henry Bumstead), and coproducer Rob Lorenz. \"The Faces of Combat\" is an 18-minute featurette about selecting the Japanese (and Japanese-American) cast ofLetters, and how they were chosen through the international collaboration of Eastwood's long-time casting director Phyllis Huffman (who turned over some of her duties to her son while struggling with terminal illness) and Japanese casting associate Yumi Takada, who filled important roles with Japanese celebrities (like pop star Kazunari Ninomiya, who plays \"Saigo\") and unknown actors alike.\"Images from the Frontlines\" is a 3.5-minute montage of images from the film and behind-the-scenes, set to the sparse piano theme of Eastwood's original score. The remaining bonus features chronicle the world premiere ofLettersin Tokyo on November 15, 2006. The premiere itself is covered in a 16-minute featurette taped at the famous Budokan arena, where we see the red-carpet procession, a full-capacity audience despite cold November weather, and introductory comments from the film's primary cast and crew, many of them quite moving with regard to the satisfaction of working on a film that helps Japanese viewers come to terms with a painful chapter of their history. The following day's press conference (at the Grand Hyatt Tokyo hotel) is a 24-minute Q&A; session covering much of the same territory, with additional testimony from principal cast & crew. Throughout this two-day event, it's clear that Eastwood (referring to himself as \"a Japanese director who doesn't speak the Japanese language\") was warmly embraced by the Japanese, and thatLetters from Iwo Jimahad served its intended purpose, reminding us of the horrors of war while uniting both Japanese and Americans in somber reflection, 61 years after the battle of Iwo Jima.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000M4RG42", "B00005PJ8T", "B00001ZWUS", "B00AEBBA36", "B001IBIHQ4", "B0015D20FE", "B00005JK8K", "B004U7MQWY", "0767802470", "B00AEFXVCU", "B00006CXSS", "B00275EGWY", "B000NTPG7A", "B00AEFXRRO", "B000065U1N", "B00003CXTG", "0792839730", "0792841409", "B007S0DCUU", "B000FVQLRA", "079284646X", "B00005PJ8S", "B0009RCPUC", "B003ASLJO0", "B00AEBB86U", "B00AEFXGIY", "B000EHSVS2", "B000P0J09C", "B003ASLJOU", "B002T9H2LA", "B000EHSVSC", "B00B0U2SFE", "B000AQ69QI", "B002O3Z4WU", "B006OFN0SE", "B003AWRMCO", "B0000BWVCR", "B00AEFYBA6", "B002O3Z510", "B00008K76U", "B00AEFYENK", "B0007TKNLA", "B003ASLJQS", "B003ASLJPE", "B00003CXHJ", "B003ASLJQI", "B00003CXA6", "B0007TKNGA", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00096S4B2", "B008XJM7T2", "0782010040", "B00004XPPC", "B001TUZG4K", "B003AWRMCE", "B009XTF8NI", "B002GHHHPQ", "B00CZB9BE8", "B00004XPPG", "B00AEFXN9G", "B0002V7ON8", "B00AEFXVOI", "B000H5V8H2", "B003ASLJKE", "B005GYSV4M", "B00005N5S3", "B0041H55H6", "B0076XTIWU", "B003AWRMC4", "B00AEFY5B6", "0800177967", "B00009OOFA", "B003ASLJMW", "0792838408", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B006TTC5HC", "B004DY1VIO", "B000NQQ4OM", "B000E5N6KW", "B003AWRMCY", "B00AEFY0F2", "B003UESJHO", "B00DL48BM6", "B003XMKU16", "B00AZNEW5G", "B003ELKNH2", "B0007P0YKY", "B000095WW8", "B002CPMB9O", "B000ELL1R6", "B000A2WJBQ", "B002ID09BM", "B0051HCVEU", "B002ZG97RE", "B0006VL1J2", "B0001GF2GU", "0792841662", "0792843576", "6304765258", "B000MGTQ7U"], "bought_together": ["B000M4RG42", "B00001ZWUS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000M4RG42", "B000P1XITE", "B00AEBBA36", "B00001ZWUS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 20999}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.44, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JPKE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51iZss0%2BzhL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Letters from Iwo Jima (Two-Disc Special Edition)"}
{"description": "While much was made of the fact thatMarie Antoinetteelicited boos at Cannes, the many favorable reviews attracted less attention. Inspired by Antonia Fraser's biography, Sofia Coppola fashions a portrait that's just as dreamy asThe Virgin Suicides, her first literary adaptation, and the Oscar-winningLost in Translation. Set to a soundtrack of post-punk (a conceit that adds more interest than resonance), the teenaged Marie (Kirsten Dunst, quite good) may be shallow, but she's rarely unsympathetic. The story begins in the late-18th century as the Austrian Archduchess agrees to marry Louis-Auguste (Jason Schwartzman). After bidding adieu to her mother, Maria Theresa (Marianne Faithfull), she travels to France, where King Louis XV (Rip Torn) sets the rules--and the list is endless (Judy Davis' Comtesse de Noailles is the primary enforcer). As for the Dauphin, he's just a boy, really, with more interest in his key collection than their marriage bed. Should Marie produce an heir, it might be enough to sustain her--since life is nothing but an endless shopping spree--but clouds gather on the horizon as an impoverished populace rises up against their extravagant leaders. Coppola merely suggests what happens next, although history paints a darker picture. Filmed in and around the Chateau of Versailles,Marie Antoinetteis a riot of rustling gowns, sparkling jewels, and Manolo Blahnik-designed shoes. To say that style trumps substance does its maker a disservice, but the look of the thing does leave the deepest impression.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "One of the first things a viewer notices aboutCloverfieldis that it doesn't play by ordinary storytelling rules, making this intriguing horror film as much a novelty as an event. Told from the vertiginous point-of-view of a camcorder-wielding group of friends,Cloverfieldbegins like a primetime television soap opera about young Manhattanites coping with changes in their personal lives. Rob (Michael Stahl-David) is leaving New York to take an executive job at a company in Japan. At his goodbye party in a crowded loft, Rob&#x92;s brother Jason (Mike Vogel) hands a camcorder to best friend Hud (T.J. Miller), who proceeds to tape the proceedings over old footage of Rob&#x92;s ex-girlfriend, Beth (Odette Yustman)--images shot during happy times in that now-defunct relationship. Naturally, Beth shows up at the party with a new beau, bumming Rob out completely. Just before one's eyes glaze over from all this heartbreaking stuff (captured by Hud, who's something of a doofus, in laughably shaky camerawork), the unexpected happens: New York is suddenly under attack from a Godzilla-like monster stomping through midtown and destroying everything and everybody in sight. Rob and company hit the streets, but rather than run with other evacuees, they head toward the center of the storm so that Rob can rescue an injured Beth. There are casualties along the way, but the journey into fear is fascinating and immediate if emotionally remote--a consequence of seeing these proceedings through the singular, subjective perspective of a camcorder and of a story that intentionally leaves major questions unanswered: Who or what is this monster? Where did it come from? The lack of a backstory, and spare views of the marauding creature, are clever ways by producer J.J. Abrams and director Matt Reeves to keep an audience focused exclusively on what&#x92;s on the screen.  But it also makesCloverfieldcuriously uninvolving. Ultimately,Cloverfield, with its spectacular effects brilliantly woven into a home-video look, is a celebration of infinite possibilities in this age of accessible, digital media.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B004EPYZQ2", "B00IO9D3ZI", "B00EMMDMKM", "B002SJIO5E", "B0044ZOI32", "B001AR0D4A", "B004BZ5AMS", "B001MVYUQQ", "B003BJO8KU", "B0018AG6X6", "B005LAIGPU", "B00IO8VMB6", "B000PKG8SS", "B003Y5H5GU", "B00BPA2PGG", "B0017U7PT6", "B001YV502C", "B0013FBS20", "B008JFUR10", "B001KZVQJI", "B001CW7ZW6", "B0035WTJFW", "B000Y7U98W", "B003ABZGRI", "B000VDDWEC", "B000VDDWEM", "B002JT69IM", "B00164EAC8", "B002ZG981E", "B00AEFXORM", "B001DZOC3W", "B008SAPC20", "B003Y5H59M", "B00HERVMTK", "B00AVSFIV2", "B0032KNA4I", "B000L212HW", "B001FB55I0", "B0018O4YSQ", "B002ZG997M", "B002ZG9788", "B008G33O0G", "B000VDDWE2", "B00K2CHVSK", "B001GCUO5W", "B005J4TLQG", "B000PC6A3E", "B0027VT9ES", "B001F7MSG6", "B0051T46XM", "B00111YM60", "B001GZ6QEC", "B002HR1W1K", "B004SIPA4G", "B001OQCVII", "B001JNNDBA", "B001GKJ2FC", "B000WQWPKA", "B000OT6V00", "B0021L8UXK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004EPYZQ2", "B00IO8VMB6", "B004LWZW4W", "B005LAIHY0"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPXY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Wm5GO98oL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cloverfield [Theatrical Release]"}

{"description": "The Dark Knightarrives with tremendous hype (best superhero movie ever? posthumous Oscar for Heath Ledger?), and incredibly, it lives up to all of it.  But calling it the best superhero movie ever seems like faint praise, since part of what makes the movie great--in addition to pitch-perfect casting, outstanding writing, and a compelling vision--is that it bypasses the normal fantasy element of the superhero genre and makes it all terrifyingly real.  Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is Gotham City's new district attorney, charged with cleaning up the crime rings that have paralyzed the city. He enters an uneasy alliance with the young police lieutenant, Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), and Batman (Christian Bale), the caped vigilante who seems to trust only Gordon--and whom only Gordon seems to trust. They make progress until a psychotic and deadly new player enters the game: the Joker (Heath Ledger), who offers the crime bosses a solution--kill the Batman. Further complicating matters is that Dent is now dating Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, after Katie Holmes turned down the chance to reprise her role), the longtime love of Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne.In his last completed role before his tragic death, Ledger is fantastic as the Joker, a volcanic, truly frightening force of evil. And he sets the tone of the movie: the world is a dark, dangerous place where there are no easy choices.  Eckhart and Oldman also shine, but as good as Bale is, his character turns out rather bland in comparison (not uncommon for heroes facing more colorful villains). Director-cowriter Christopher Nolan (Memento) follows his critically acclaimedBatman Beginswith an even better sequel that sets itself apart from notable superhero movies likeSpider-Man 2andIron Manbecause of its sheer emotional impact and striking sense of realism--there are no suspension-of-disbelief superpowers here. At 152 minutes, it's a shade too long, and it's much too intense for kids. But for most movie fans--and not just superhero fans--The Dark Knightis a film for the ages.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B000PC6A3E", "B002ZG981E", "B00G4RD4PQ", "B0039208QM", "B001GMALGY", "B00E2Y0YBK", "B00C2IGQBA", "B0039208JE", "B00H14WTLQ", "B0039208CG", "B0085D3I3K", "B0039208C6", "B000M5AJQI", "B00319ECGK", "B001FB55H6", "B00EIG5M5A", "7020070078", "B00E2Y6AUY", "B00D5FMGGS", "B001OQCV6K", "B0013FBS20", "B000Q6GX5Y", "B001GKJ2FC", "B00FPS79F6", "B001992NUQ", "B004JMSIRC", "B001RIY4WE", "B00DYEN6XC", "B008QZ5PY2", "B001F7MSG6", "B00FAHYNWE", "B00J7PRJXU", "B001AQT0Z4", "B001UV4XEW", "B0083SBJXS", "B00AEFY552", "B00C8RD79O", "B007KAJG3K", "B007L4HET8", "B004EPZ07U", "B007L4HFDI", "B00AEFXKOO", "B000PC0U1W", "B00C6B8TB8", "B00HINFI4K", "B003TT2X6I", "B001KZIRM2", "B002ZG99NG", "B00EZ4M68G", "B004SIP90G", "B003ZHR6RK", "B001GCUO16", "B003TT2X6S", "B00JNEWSLS", "B001F3FUK6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B002ZG981E", "B000PC6A3E"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPY0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pGxSkkz4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Dark Knight [Theatrical Release]"}

{"description": "Saya, the last true vampire, battles the bloodthirsty demons attacking an American base in Japan during the Vietnam War. Much of the story takes place during the late afternoon and evening, and the artists use shadows, reflections, and light with exceptional skill: the look of the film is more interesting than the underdeveloped story. Saya wields a deadly sword and pursues her foes with chilling ferocity, but she's silent and sullen and fails to develop as a character: the viewer has no idea how she views her deadly occupation. Albeit a visually striking film, this dark, violent work fails to live up to its billing as \"Japan's first fully digital animated feature film\": the three-dimensional objects and effects are digital, but the two-dimensional characters are hand-drawn. Nor is the film really \"from the creators ofGhost in the Shell.\"Bloodcame out of a group thatGhostdirector Mamoru Oshii organized to encourage young talent, but he didn't direct it. And at 48 minutes, it's very short for a feature, although this edition includes a rambling 21-minute making-of film and a 3-minute trailer. It seems unlikely thatBlood\"will transform Japanese animation,\" but other artists may use its visual style to tell more compelling stories with better-developed characters.

{"description": "Another of those cut-and-paste comedies from Adam Sandler's production company starring one of Sandler's erstwhileSaturday Night Livecolleagues,The Adventures of Joe Dirtfinds the magnificently caustic David Spade emasculated by a sentimental script and shapeless, haphazard cutting. Spade plays the title character, a white-trash orphan in search of the parents who abandoned him at the Grand Canyon. The humor is supposed to come from Joe's misadventures, his redneck gullibility, and his encounters with such figures as a serial killer, a wacked-out janitor (Christopher Walken), and a lovable gal (Jamie Pressly) who may, unfortunately, turn out to be his sister. But the squishier requirements of the story, requiring the audience to feel deeply for the pain of Spade's caricature, are an irritant and force Spade to veer from the nastier stuff he does so well.

{"description": "Friendshas matured into one of the few sitcoms that can truly be judged \"must-see.\" The ensemble cast--Courteney Cox Arquette, Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Kudrow, Matthew Perry, David Schwimmer, and Matt LeBlanc--provide a master class in chemistry in this four-tape set. The first volume includes some of the best of the Ross-Rachel episodes, including \"Pilot\" (the one that started their star-crossed relationship), in which runaway bride Rachel moves in with Monica. Other episodes include \"The One Where Ross Finds Out\" and \"The One with the Prom Video,\" which finally bring Ross and Rachel together. Highlights of the second volume are the two-part \"The One with Ross's Wedding,\" in which Ross famously blurts the wrong name at the altar, launching Monica and Chandler's secret affair, and two fifth-season gems, \"The One with All the Thanksgivings\" and \"The One Where Everybody Finds Out\" (about Monica and Chandler). Volume 3 includes another hilarious Chandler-Janice hookup in \"The One with the Candy Hearts,\" the Thanksgiving grudge match for the precious Geller Cup in \"The One with the Football,\" and a roads-not-taken episode called \"The One That Could Have Been.\" Finally, the fourth volume contains two great Thanksgiving episodes, \"The One with Chandler in a Box\" and \"The One Where Ross Got High.\" Relive other series milestones, including \"The Hundredth Episode,\" in which Phoebe gives birth to triplets; \"The One with All the Resolutions,\" in which Rachel finds out about secret couple Monica and Chandler; and \"The One with the Proposal,\" in which Chandler's plans to propose to Monica are complicated by the reappearance of her lost love Richard (Tom Selleck).--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00005YU82", "B00KHA88PC", "B0000541SA"]}, "price": 10.29, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 469468}, "asin": "B00005NTO2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FHF3ZV2VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Best of Friends Collection (Vol. 1-4) [VHS]"}

{"description": "French humor, which isn't exactly subtle, is delivered via an especially broad premise inThe Closet. A nebbish (Daniel Auteuil) who works at a condom manufacturer learns he's about to be fired; with the help of his neighbor, he pretends to be gay so his boss can't fire him without seeming prejudiced. Then a bigoted coworker (Gerard Depardieu) tries to worm his way into the nebbish's good graces becausehe'safraid of being fired. In the wrong hands,The Closetcould be ham-fisted slapstick. What makes this movie truly delightful is the superb understatement with which every gag is handled; even the sight of Auteuil wearing a giant condom tip on his head has an impeccable deadpan grace. All the performances are excellent; Depardieu's smarm is particularly delicious.

{"description": "Sure, Johnny Cash is a country superstar and a founding father of rock & roll--but why, exactly?Johnny Cash: The Anthologyis an efficient and highly enjoyable effort to answer that question through a rare historical perspective. Comprised of a 54-minute documentary and a supplementary film entitledHalf Mile a Day,The Anthologyplaces Cash dead center at the junction of gospel and blues traditions: between the isolation of hard living in America, delusional guilt from too much sin, and the fragile redemption of love. Drawing upon archival footage of Cash performing his earliest crossover hits (\"Five Feet High and Risin',\" \"I Walk the Line\") and including comments by admiring peers (Rodney Crowell, Porter Wagoner),The Anthologymakes a compelling case for Cash as a master of knife-edged economy and a populist oracle from a younger, perhaps scarier, America.

Wimsey, deftly played by Edward Petherbridge, is still proposing marriage at frequent intervals. Harriet (Harriet Walter), though unable to say yes, is also unable to send Lord Peter entirely away. But enough with the romance. As Wimsey heads off for some foreign service work, Harriet visits her alma mater and lands smack in the middle of a poison-pen scandal. Harriet's status as a mystery writer, naturally, means she's the one who should investigate. Sayers clearly had fun writing this one, using Harriet to gently tweak her own profession, at the same time both parodying and defending the cloistered life at a women's college.

{"description": "The 1985 seriesTatakae Cho Robot Seimetai Transformers(\"Fight Super Living Robots Transformers\") was a U.S.-Japanese coproduction, written in America and animated in Japan. Based on a line of robot toys from Takara--licensed to Hasbro in America--that could be reconfigured into cars, trucks, planes, etc., it spawned numerous sequels and a feature. Civil war rages on the planet Cybertron between the virtuous Autobots and the evil Decepticons. Both sides launch crews into space to find new energy sources, but the ships crash on Earth and are buried in lava. When the robots awaken four million years later, the Decepticons, led by the dictatorial Megatron, want to drain the planet of its resources, enslaving or destroying mankind. The Autobots ally with humanity and befriend oil-rig worker Spike Witwicky. The Saturday morning-style cheat of cutting to a logo, rather than animating transitions, and the frequent pauses for commercial breaks make for very choppy storytelling. The designs of the robots are interesting but lack the graphic sophistication of Yoshiyuki Tomino'sGundamMobile Suits. The animation is very limited, and the choreography of the battle sequences lacks the panache of Tomino and other more talented directors. LikeRobotech,Transformerswill appeal most strongly to adults who watched the show as kids: it's remained popular through Web sites, role-playing games, fan fiction, and a lively trade in the original toys. Serious students of anime will find this early series of historic interest. Unrated; suitable for age 6 and up: Robot vs. robot violence.--Charles Solomon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006L9PL", "B00008RH31", "B0000C89IP", "B0001GOH8E", "B0031L5CJE", "B0029PUUSQ", "B000H6SY5K", "B00014NECG", "B0000AGQ3M", "B000SM7R2O", "B00028HBNO", "B005BUA1H6", "B001N6FPQY", "B00HRUQAKU", "B000EHSVM8", "B000EHSVKK", "B002NN7EX8", "B007C8RZL0", "B00AQ590IC", "B0056GLNQI", "B000HC2LRG", "B000A88EU0", "B000NQRV80", "B0055UA1KO", "B001BN25VW", "B000AJJNI6", "B000EHSVLY", "B0058JEHSO", "B002TMI2A2", "B0000AKY3Q", "B0002LE9FE", "B0007RT9MG", "B000I0QLR8", "B000GPIPTM", "B000I0QLS2", "B005335K7W", "B0087AOYCU", "B002DH20Q0", "B00005JN0T", "B00005NG69", "B00005MEUW", "B007KFZ85K", "B000J3FBUM", "B00005BJEF", "B001OMZYHC", "B00001U0DX", "B0023S4A26", "B000063K16", "B00007KK2K", "B001EJQ2DA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001SLNPTI", "B004NJC0JI", "B00008RH31", "B002NN7EX8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 159116}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 74.95, "brand": "Transformers", "asin": "B000063K17", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/419VS60KYBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Transformers: Season 1 (Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "Grab your favorite munchies, kids. Red and Meth, that dope-addled dynamic duo, are going to Harvard! And while it's not an episode ofMasterpiece Theatre,How Highis destined to become a guilty pleasure of the cannabis crowd. The plot's a familiar one--take the basic selling points of any Cheech & Chong movie (a pair of shambolic protagonists who smoke lots of weed while slinging slang and driving funky, '70s-style cars), graft them onto a generic \"raising hell on campus\" teen movie scenario, and shake vigorously. The result is a prosaic effort that does contain some all-too-brief moments of genuine humor. Red and Meth, a.k.a. Redman and Method Man, may look like the world's oldest freshmen, but both offer genial performances, especially Method Man, who imbues the character of Silas with a dog-eared gentleness that raises him above the film's leaden script and plasticine directing.--Rebecca Levine", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006HBZE2", "B00006HAYO", "B004P7CMZ0", "B000069DOB", "B001DJLD12", "B000EMGJAO", "6304821832", "B00003CY51", "B0000YEE6M", "0780631234", "B007VYEE0A", "6305505780", "B004H83INW", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B004SIP93S", "B001J9KJ4I", "B0002J4YVK", "B000BITV9W", "B00AEFYE08", "1558908390", "B002CA68MU", "B000UNYJWM", "0767813901", "B002CA68NO", "B00003GPFT", "B00ANDDBBY", "B000FS9ULC", "B00007ELEO", "B00005JLQT", "B00000JGHV", "B0000AGQ6T", "B002GSXKO2", "B00005JLG1", "B002CA68N4", "B0000714BU", "B0041QSZ9M", "B00004Y2R1", "0767811070", "0767821955", "B00AEFYAC0", "B00AG4714S", "B0000AC8LH", "B000CPH9PM", "B000JRYOPG", "0783237367", "B000071ZZJ", "B000EQ45CE", "B0000JBUHI", "B00007BK2S", "B000IZJZIU", "B00003CXS7", "0780627822", "B00AMSM9AO", "B00003CXPS", "B000060MWA", "B000WZEZGI", "B001AEF6HM", "B0000TWMTS", "B004QL7K70", "B001TUZGPO", "B00E1HIXA2", "B000089729", "B005SHBO1Y", "B000RETOHO", "B00E1HIX66", "B0000TWMWK", "B00068WOH8", "B0019X3YZA", "B00003CXWV", "B000VG66XS", "B0034G4P1C", "B000C20VRS", "B00009W5F2", "B002GSXKOM", "B003NH6FY2", "B00005JLQE", "B000SM6FLI", "B00005JD5J", "B00AEFYQWO", "B00029RTAI", "B008DL4KZY", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00066FAQW", "B00DW5IL2E", "B0041QSZS8", "B00AEBB9AA", "B00BLN4V46", "B00007BK2T", "B004499NII", "B002VWNIEA", "630529142X", "B00005JKMN", "B00AEFXPG2", "B00AMEZDJW", "B0023TCWE8", "B002FOFX9M", "B00441GYVA", "B000HDZKLO", "B002CA68MK", "B00AEFYZCU"], "bought_together": ["B0006HBZE2", "B000EMGJAO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0006HBZE2", "B001DJLD12", "B004H83INW", "B000EMGJAO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10968}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.68, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

{"description": "The James Bond Collection, Vol. 1collects the same feature-packed DVDs that appeared inprevious Bond boxes, but in a new combination of titles, one with a decidedly golden gleam. In 1962 Sean Connery defined the cinematic James Bond as a tough, charming, and thoroughly professional cold war spy with a license to kill in the lean, hard-edgedDr. No. With Ursula Andress (as the original Bond girl Honeychile Ryder, who makes her entrance in a bikini), Bond battles a renegade supervillain with little more than his wits, his cunning, and his Walther PPK. InGoldfinger(1964) Connery's steely presence helped forge the formula of tongue-in-cheek wit, wondrous secret agent toys created by Q, and megalomaniac supervillains bent on world destruction.Roger Moore brought a light tone and a suave assurance to the series, and inThe Man with the Golden Gun(1974), he battles million-dollar assassin Christopher Lee, one of Bond's most magnetic adversaries.The Spy Who Loved Me(1977), perhaps Moore's finest hour, is a return to the extravagant set pieces and cold war thrills of Connery's pictures and introduces Richard Kiel's steel-dentured Jaws to the series. Timothy Dalton made his second and final appearance as Bond inLicence to Kill(1989), the toughest of the Bond films since Connery's early efforts. Though not a fan favorite, it's a sleek, solid adventure with an edge missing from the Moore pictures.Pierce Brosnan is the latest to take on the 007 mantle, combining the best of Connery's cool and Moore's humor.GoldenEye(1995) is a grand globetrotting adventure with lovely Bond girls and a tough new M (Judy Dench).Tomorrow Never Dies(1997) doesn't recapture that magic mix of action, gadgetry, and romance, but does feature the first Bond girl to match 007 blow for blow: Hong Kong action superstar Michelle Yeoh. The DVD editions of the films each feature audio commentary tracks by the director and key members of the crew, making-of documentaries, and a host of stills, TV spots, and trailers.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000BYRO7", "B0000BYRO9", "B001PPLIEG", "B00AQSN7HE", "B007REV4T8", "B00004WEJZ", "B00AZFECL8", "B000ICM5V2", "B000NIBUR6", "B000RPCK1K", "B001R10BN2", "B00000BCPF", "B000M53GNG", "B00000BLFI", "B000RPCK24", "B000RPCK1A", "B000NIBURG", "B000ICM5VC", "B000NDEXPM", "B0045HCJFS", "B00005JL0I", "B000RPCK1U", "B000M53GLS", "B000NIBURQ", "B000M53GN6", "B009PN18R2", "B008YAPQX4", "B000NDEXPC", "B000E6ESEY", "B00EYA6VD2", "B000RPCK0Q", "B00AZMFJYA", "B009PN3OD8", "B009A87ZQU", "B007REV4YI", "B002GHHHME", "B0050FXDDQ", "B00004RG62", "B00DH34G9S", "B001EDVNNU", "B00388PK7O", "B00003CXQA", "B00JA3RVG4", "B002I9Z8I0", "6304711891", "B001F12J0C", "B00G7QQ0RS", "B005PTYP70", "B000M53GMW", "B000NIBUS0", "1618930311", "B00005JKBC", "B004SIP95G"], "bought_together": ["B0000BYRO7", "B0000BYRO9"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B006U1JD5G", "B007REV4T8", "B008YAPQX4", "B0000BYRO9"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 46258}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 56.99, "brand": "", "asin": "B00006BH8G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X7K7WRN3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The James Bond Collection, Vol. 1 (Special Edition)"}

So everyone worries: what will become of Toula? Then one day she sees the ultimate unattainable guy and realizes the only way her life will get better is if he gets away from her big, fat Greek family. Toula escapes from the family restaurant. She exchanges her seating hostess jacket for a college diploma, convinces her aunt to give her a new job, and trades in her coke-bottle glasses for contact lenses, just in time for \"him\" to walk back into her life. Ian Miller is tall, handsome but defnitely not Greek. Their courtship is an Olympian culture clash. Can Ian handle Toula, her parents, her aunts, uncles, cousins and several centuries of Greek heritage? Will Toula discover the love she's been missing right in the heart of her big, fat family? One thing is for sure, for better or worse, for richer or poorer, with Ian's proposal Toula is headed for her big, fat Greek wedding.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0021L8UO4", "B000EHRVOW", "B00386EZKE", "B000ELJAEM", "B0013D8LHC", "B00003CXSM", "B00AEBB8NS", "6304765266", "B0000CGNEF", "B00466HN7M", "B00005JG6N", "B000BKVQS4", "B0007RT9M6", "B0009OL7Z4", "B0038N9X3Q", "6305236569", "B002ZG988M", "B001AKTZW8", "B00006ZXSL", "B000YDBPAM", "B0015I2RT8", "B001TUZD8O", "B0000AOV4I", "B00AEBB8YW", "B000MQC9H4", "B00007E2F5", "B002ZG989G", "B0001AVZA8", "B0000897EG", "B00AEFXYOA", "B004SIP9RO", "B0007PLLBU", "B000OCZA04", "B00008NRI7", "B001GKJ2DY", "B002K0WBXW", "B00008G7UF", "B008R65XMO", "B000A343RI", "B001ECDVK4", "B0000VD02Y", "B000023VTP", "B001Y8DJVE", "B002ZG9968", "B003BV8ICC", "B0001XALGY", "B003B3V0N4", "B00006ZXSO", "B00006ZXSK", "B002U4UYZA", "B002U1LGTQ", "B00005JN3W", "B003Y5H524", "B000GETTIE", "B000J103OI", "B00DW5IJR6", "B00003CXC3", "B00AEFY99O", "B00AEBBA2M", "B001LMAK9W", "B0042816YK", "B006VRRGQ2", "B000JU8H9C", "B004IK30PA", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B005LAIGXW", "B0000B1OFL", "B00158K0QU", "B004SIP9VA", "B00006ZXSQ", "6305428352", "B005Z9MFRC", "B000K7VHTQ", "B000Z8GZYW", "B00AEFY5TI", "0767810856", "B0001I55M4", "B004SIP8LG", "B000FOPPC4", "B000E6EHE0", "B00005JPSM", "0800177258", "6305428387", "6305803781", "B004EPZ070", "0800141849"], "bought_together": ["B00386EZKE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00386EZKE", "B00466HN7M", "B0021L8UO4", "B0009OL7Z4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2192}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00006FMUW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EhfedTTUL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "My Big Fat Greek Wedding"}

{"description": "To the ranks of shows too brilliant and outrageous for prime time (The Ben Stiller Show,Andy Richter Controls the Universe), add Seth McFarlane'sFamily Guy. This animated series, which debuted after the 1999 Super Bowl, simply sparked too much controversy and offended too many sensibilities to survive (Entertainment Weeklydubbed it \"the Awful Show They Just Keep Putting on the Air\"). That the Fox network also played hackysack with its schedule, ensuring viewers would not be able to find it, sealed its fate (it was cancelled in 2002). This boxed set containing all 28 episodes from the first two seasons is payback for the show's devoted cult following, who may be moved to echo the words of infant Stewie Griffin, the megalomaniacal 1-year-old bent on matricide and world domination: \"Victory is mine!\"The dysfunctional Griffins of Quahog, Rhode Island, invite comparisons toThe Simpsons. The testicular-chinned father, Peter Griffin, is a clueless oaf in the Homer mold. \"Peter, what did you promise me last night?\" asks his long-suffering wife Lois in one episode. \"That I wouldn't drink at the stag party,\" he replies. \"And what did you do?\" she asks. \"Drank at the stag part--oh ho ho, I almost walked into that one,\" he cackles. Other family members include teenage daughter Meg, a desperate high school social pariah; 13-year-old son Chris, a chip off his father's blockhead; and Brian, the family's sarcastic talking dog. But this series' true inspiration is football-pated Stewie (voiced by McFarlane, who earned an Emmy), who was born to be a Bond villain once he escaped his mother's \"ovarian bastille.\"Family Guyrecklessly ventured whereThe Simpsonsfeared to tread. In one episode, Meg's one and only friend turns out to be the member of a suicidal cult. In another, Death (voiced by Norm McDonald) becomes an unwanted houseguest. Each episode plays fast and furious with surreal flashes (in one episode, Peter turns his house into a puppet) and pop-culture references and TV, movie, and commercial parodies that invite repeated viewings. Freed from its own family-hour bastille and the whims of dim network executives,Family Guycan be appreciated at last on its own profane, sacrilegious, and irreverent terms. Welcome to the DVD family, Griffins.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008YGRV", "B000AQ68Z0", "B000HT3P6U", "B000RO6JZO", "B0012018OE", "B001VFM0ZG", "B003DZX46G", "B003L77G9W", "B0058YPMHO", "B00E0FW054", "B000E6ES9O", "B000A3DFV8", "B00FR81Z40", "B003V3FVQ6", "B000NNK4DM", "B0006B41GM", "B0040JHX0W", "B0012KSUTA", "B001N9VW5Y", "B001RIZ7OI", "B003X4KHRG", "B002LARYTW", "B002JVWQYG", "B00023P49C", "B003CN5B7E", "B000YOX3HE", "B008412UKA", "B0053O8A32", "B0058RN7KA", "B003L77G7Y", "B00023P49M", "B007KFZ85K", "B000E0OE3K", "B00008YGRS", "B0000CABL2", "B00LFW6BA0", "B00BYNL8DU", "B0001ZWLVU", "B008412UQ4", "B004696M94", "B007KFZ7UQ", "B005QIOJUI", "B0044E9JTG", "B007KFZ88M", "B000RW3VDE", "B009SQ9Q5M", "B00A2JFNSS", "B0018RKEQE", "B007KFZ7PG", "B000067DNE", "B007KFZ7YM", "B007KFZ8AK", "B001L1S1PS", "B0001MZ7KA", "B000CNESM6", "B002LASCJ8", "B007KFZ87S", "B007KFZ7Q0", "B0002WZRSG", "B004MLEYTG", "B0006Z2L2Y", "B007KFZ8AA", "B00005JM3G", "B008OTH56Q", "B000ADWCYY", "B007ZFR67I", "B000B5XOR0", "B000FSME2Y", "B0044E9JSW", "B000FEBWTE", "B000B5XOWU", "B0000C2IQB", "B008AITJ7O", "B00000F5W8", "B007KFZ8B4", "B00005JOHC", "B005CGI4EG", "B0086UVMEE", "B000W91RUG", "B0024FAR6Q", "B000ERVJNG", "B003L77G6U", "B0060OKO2O", "B00BUWD7Y8", "B006W93ELK", "B001O0TWXG", "B003KZ27N0", "B00775R45A", "B000GPIPTM", "B002N5N4FS", "B0030Y11UG", "B000GETTKM", "B00HDU9UOW", "B002C11LCG", "B0000AQS81", "B00AIANIPQ", "B000KLQUMQ", "B000TM1CKQ", "B004XVMCH6", "B004MLEYUK"], "bought_together": ["B00008YGRV", "B000AQ68Z0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00008YGRV", "B00E0FW054", "B000HT3P6U", "B003L77G9W"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 28363}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 11.89, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B000083C6V", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N2CR5F9CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Family Guy, Volume One"}

{"description": "There is at least one certifiable masterpiece in Rainer Werner Fassbinder'sBRD Trilogy, and one could argue that  all three films qualify for that honor. Conceived as a series of sociopolitical melodramas set during West Germany's \"economic miracle\" of post-war recovery (roughly 1947-60), these exquisitely crafted films found the prolific Fassbinder (1945-82) near the end of his astounding career and at the height of his creative powers, depicting post-war Germany as a land of repressed memory and surging capitalism, repressively avoiding any connection to the horrors of its Nazi past. Women were Fassbinder's conduit to analyzing the BDR (Bundesrepublik Deutchland) and its effect on the German character, resulting in three of the most remarkable female characters ever committed to film.As noted in an affectionate commentary track by Fassbinder's friend and fellow director Wim Wenders,The Marriage of Maria Braun(1979) is Fassbinder's undisputed masterwork, a critical and box-office triumph that fulfilled Fassbinder's goal of creating a \"German Hollywood melodrama\" in the tradition of his director-hero, Douglas Sirk. Beautifully shot by Michael Ballhaus (who advanced to brilliant collaborations with Martin Scorsese), it stars Hanna Schygulla in her signature role as a newlywed whose missing husband returns in the mid-'50s, just as she's reinventing herself through opportunism, seduction, and blind ambition--a woman, like Germany, determined to forget her miserable past, with explosively tragic results. \"BRD 2\" is the wickedly satiricalVeronika Voss(1982), filmed in black and white (a stylistic nod to German'y's post-war thrillers) and starring Rosel Zech as a faded film star-turned-morphine addict making futile attempts to revive her career. Set in 1957,Lola(\"BRD 3,\" 1981) is Fassbinder's homage to Josef von Sternberg'sThe Blue Angel, and stars Barbara Sukowa as a cabaret singer and prostitute who, like Maria Braun, is for sale to the highest bidder--in this case a straight-laced official (Armin Mueller-Stahl) who discovers the high cost of ignorance.Taken together, these films form an impressively coherent vision, compassionate and yet brutally honest, unsentimental, and provocatively critical of post-war Germany. In the established tradition of the Criterion Collection, extensive supplements explore the depth of Fassbinder's achievement. Three commentaries, each with their own uniquely personal and/or critical perspective, are among the finest Criterion has ever recorded. Interviews with Schygulla, Zech, Sukowa, and many of Fassbinder's closest collaborators pay latter-day tribute to Fassbinder and his extended family of on- and off-screen talent, while the 96-minute German TV documentaryI Don't Just Want You to Love Meexplores Fassbinder's tragically curtailed life and work through abundant film clips and interviews. A filmed 1978 interview with Fassbinder himself--at 49 minutes, the longest ever recorded--offers further insight into the psychology and chain-smoking intensity of a man who burned out from drugs and exhaustion at the age of 37. Along with the collectedAdventures of Antoine Doinel, theBRD Trilogyis one of the most impressive DVD sets ever released, and a sparkling jewel in Criterion's crown.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000VARC2S", "B00HVOFP6W", "B0007WFYC0", "B000FVGNSM", "B00005QAPJ", "B000FWGYU8", "B00HE010QM", "B000PKG6O4", "B0001ZIYDO", "B00004Z1FM", "B00CUKTHDO", "B00009Y3OK", "B002U6DVQ2", "B000065AZ9", "B00HVOFP08", "B000093NQY", "B0046ZYEVG", "B000QXDFRQ", "B002BWP4A6", "B003ULW74S", "B00005B1ZK", "B004ALIG4W", "B00005A8TU", "B0002JP2OS", "B0019X3ZZO", "B000059H7Q", "B00K5EJHGO", "B000093NR0", "B00HE011DE", "B001CW7ZSA", "B00GPPXNEE", "B00005JKGX", "B0081GLD0G", "B00GA9F2PI", "B002EBRFCY", "B00180R06I", "B000OVLBGC", "B00JGR3M26", "B001WLMOHI", "B00GBT62PQ", "B000BC8SWE", "B00005JKPT", "0780020707", "1559408944", "B00IGK6TGU", "0780022629", "B004WPYO7E", "B000TXNDVG", "B001PYD0KW", "B001EP8EL2", "B00F98FOI6", "B004ALIG4M", "B00092ZLEY", "B00005A8TV", "B002IVDLGY", "B001O549FM", "B00I4X8KU2", "B000065AZB", "B004JOBATI", "B0000C2IV9", "B004WPYO6U", "B0009WIE8Y", "B003N2CVRC", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B0002VEVDO", "B00004W457", "B00GPPXNIK", "B000HT3QBE", "0780021541", "B0047P5FSQ", "B000XQ4HQO", "B001TIQT7A", "B004CIIXFA", "B00004ZBVO", "B0000633SC", "B004KVXC64", "B00A8QDHYW", "B0011U3OA6", "B00000F7E6", "B001LMU1C8", "B00I116MZ2", "B0068CEGFY", "B005HK13OK", "B0019X400I", "B00AIBZLHS", "B000C8Q900", "0780023161", "B00F98FNNM", "B000NOK0HG", "B000OPPADS", "B005HK13T0", "B002IVDLH8", "B004TJ1H1E", "B001CW7ZT4", "B00DZP1BUU", "B00GPPXP6A", "B000I8OOG0", "B001BEK8BU", "B009RWRIMA", "B00006LPER"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000VARC2S", "B000GRU8TK", "B000HOJF5U", "B000FVGNSM"]}, "price": 97.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 184933}, "asin": "B0000AKY56", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/418TEE3E0XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The BRD Trilogy (The Marriage of Maria Braun / Veronika Voss / Lola) (The Criterion Collection)"}
{"description": "Harrison Ford lends his solid, perpetually disgruntled presence toHollywood Homicide, an action comedy in which he's paired with the squinty eyes and peaches-and-cream complexion of Josh Hartnett (Black Hawk Down,O). Radical French filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard would appreciate this complete deconstruction of the buddy-cop flick genre; basic cinematic elements (mismatched partners, a hard-ass superior riding them, arguments about who's going to drive, arguments about intuition vs. diligent detective work, the bad cop who killed Hartnett's father, etc.) have been scrambled and slapped together with no concern for coherence, making clear their innately artificial nature. Sex scenes and car chases come out of nowhere and disappear without consequence, providing arbitrary visual stimulus. During shootouts, it's impossible to tell who got killed or why, underscoring a basic doubt about the purpose of making movies likeHollywood Homicide. It's rare for a mainstream movie to be so daringly (if perhaps accidentally) avant-garde.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000F8DV1M", "B001DJLD08", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B001UDS4BS", "B00AEFYENK", "6305213283", "B00AEBB9UK", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00441GYZQ", "B00096S4DK", "B00005LB88", "6305133476", "0792844017", "0767803434", "B00AEFYW64", "B002ZG98FU", "B000K2UVZM", "B0045HCJ8K", "B0045HCJFS", "B000FKO5QK", "0767821513", "B00067BBMS", "B00AEBB9NM", "B002ZG97J2", "B00008EYA5", "B00005JLX2", "B000085EF5", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00008EY9G", "B004SEUJ9Q", "B004P7CN7W", "B000BYA4J2", "B0015OKWL2", "B004EPYZSK", "B002AT8K9W", "B0007IO6NM", "0767802578", "B001NY4WYC", "6304698747", "0790732149", "B00008K76V", "B00009MEKO", "B00005UQ9T", "B004EPYZT4", "0767818024", "B003LR5BD0", "B003A12WBQ", "0790731460", "6305263248", "B00004WG2F", "B000P0J06U", "B0087DFIYA", "B00008OE4W", "B000MGBLTQ", "B0034G4ORC", "B0019EXZY4", "6305133468", "B0000AZT79", "B0000B1OFL", "B002ZG96ZC", "B001OST0LW", "B000OYAT3U", "B00005R5GM", "B000LC3ICE", "B00E1HIWXU", "B00260HH2G", "B00BTYOYG2", "B001UV4XGA", "B0000A9GHD", "B003AWRM9W", "B004P7CMVE", "B000EHSVOG", "B00005N5S5", "B000XT1P4S", "B000069DOB", "B001BGS17Q", "B003Q6D2B4", "B001GMAVGE", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B00AEFXT1S", "B001VLBDD0", "B004A8ZWSS", "B000YDMPC4", "0792844874", "B001GKJ2E8", "B00AEBB9UU", "B000JYW5BE", "B000XJD34I", "B008CRB1HY", "B008JFURII", "B002AS464Q", "B0001Z37HM", "B000BFH2C8", "B00008K76W", "B000P0J08S", "0783229364", "B001SN78JO", "B00AEBB95K", "B00BUAEYVK", "B0045HCJ8A"], "bought_together": ["6305213283"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AU740H2", "B001UDS4BS", "B001DJLD08", "B00005LB88"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 45508}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.0, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0000B00KB", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XVMJ3CPGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hollywood Homicide"}

{"description": "The sixth season ofBuffy the Vampire Slayerfollowed the logic of plot and character development into some gloomy places. The year begins with Buffy being raised from the dead by the friends who miss her, but who fail to understand that a sacrifice taken back is a sacrifice negated. Dragged out of what she believes to have been heavenly bliss, she finds herself \"going through the motions\" and entering into a relationship with the evil, besotted vampire Spike just to force her emotions.  Willow becomes ever more caught up in the temptations of magic; Xander and Anya move towards marriage without ever discussing their reservations; Giles feels he is standing in the way of Buffy's adult independence; Dawn feels neglected. What none of them need is a menace that is, at this point, simply annoying--three high school contemporaries who have turned their hand to magical and high-tech villainy. Added to this is a hungry ghost, an invisibility ray, an amnesia spell and a song-and-dance demon (who acts as rationale for the incomparable musical episode \"Once More, with Feeling\").This is a year in which chickens come home to roost: everything from the villainy of the three geeks to Xander's doubts about marriage come to a head, often--as in the case of the impressive wedding episode--through wildly dark humor. The estrangement of the characters from each other--a well-observed portrait of what happens to college pals in their early 20s--comes to a shocking head with the death of a major character and that death's apocalyptic consequences. The series ends on a consoling note which it has, by that point and in spite of imperfections, entirely earned.--Roz Kaveney", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EHSVN2", "B000EHSVM8", "B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVLE", "B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVKK", "B000I0QLRI", "B000I0QLRS", "B000I0QLS2", "B000I0QLQY", "B000I0QLR8", "B007H9CNOI", "B000HD1482", "B003YF9Q08", "1593078226", "B00006J3WH", "B0006IUE16", "B0009W5J4Q", "B002JVWR4U", "B000ERVJM2", "B000GG4Y6O", "B000JLTRIG", "B000CCBCGM", "1595825584", "1595826106", "B000B5XOW0", "B00001R3O1", "B0024FAR66", "B001FB4W0C", "B00AMDA2QC", "1595821651", "B005CM1IIE", "B000OIOPHC", "B006LG74Q0", "B00JF5G8WU", "159307963X", "B00344EAQO", "B0000AQS0F", "B00466H3CW", "B002U8XW9Q", "B000X5SPBI", "1595824154", "B000BOH990", "B000BOH98G", "1595823425", "B00133QNSG", "B003R4ZMN6", "B00511N79O", "B000O77SN6", "B008EVT42W", "B000BOH986", "B000CNE0SS", "B009LDCXNY", "B0002XVKMM", "B000RO6JYK", "B00076ONT6", "B009LDCWWG", "B00IWTVDUW", "B000FP2OPY", "B006LG74RE", "B000R7GKQE", "B0010YSD7M", "B00243FQFA", "B000O77SMW", "1442412097", "B003R0MF7G", "B002JVWRAO", "B009LDD4V4", "B001MVWRNO", "B001AQO43M", "0789326302", "B000JW1TYU", "B000AO9BSS", "1595823107", "B004YM6JLO", "B0000C9JFQ", "B0006J28E6", "B001RXDM2C", "B000EXDS3E", "B005PPMHO2", "B00466H3CC", "B0058YPGL6", "B00133QNS6", "B00006FD9N", "B001992NWO", "B0001O3YLM", "1595829229", "B00A8KJN8M", "B003L77GAQ", "B00133QNRW", "B00005JNOG", "B001MVWRNE", "B00AMDA2P8", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B000G1R4TS", "B0077PTWHI", "B001QE99AQ", "B000EXDS34", "B00344EAKA", "B001M5UDGS"], "bought_together": ["B000EHSVN2", "B000EHSVM8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EHSVM8", "B000EHSVLY", "B0046XG48O", "B000EHSVLE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 112363}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 34.59, "brand": "", "asin": "B0000DANYD", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417707V8Z5L._SX300_.jpg", "title": "Buffy The Vampire Slayer - The Complete Sixth Season"}

And that's truer than ever when they receive an expenses-paid holiday tour of the South Pacific and end up shipwrecked on a remote island.

{"description": "TheCatalog of CooldescribesGreen Acresthis way:To be truly cool, one must genuinely understand the uselessness of logic and reason in a world gone mad.... Eddie Albert (ostensibly sane) spent six seasons appealing to the whacked out citizens of Hooterville to behave in a rational and orderly manner. Naturally, he got just what he deserved--the gradual erosion of his own mental stability. Aficionados of this show like to call it surreal. I call it real life.All one can add to that, to paraphrase the classic title song, is that DVD is the place forGreen Acresto be. Hooterville may have been condemned by critics as a vast wasteland, but as the first season demonstrates, it provides fertile ground for bizarre behavior for a gallery of classic characters who rival the residents ofTwin Peaks.  \"Oliver Buys a Farm,\" the series pilot, is a comparatively tame episode that gives little hint of the weirdness to come. Lawyer Oliver Wendell Douglas (Albert), weary of life in New York (\"It's a rat race, and the rats are winning!\" he declares), buys the Haney place to the horror of his socialite wife Lisa (Eva Gabor), whose ditziness has yet to be established. Look for appearances byPetticoat Junctiondenizens Uncle Joe (Edgar Buchannan), Sam Drucker (Frank Cady), Hooterville Cannonball engineer Floyd Smoot (Rufe Davis), and everyone's favorite wonder pig, Arnold Ziffel.Among the season's other episodes, in \"The Day of Decision,\" all of Hooterville wonders whether \"she will\" or \"she won't\" as Lisa chooses between life on the farm or returning to New York. In \"Never Look a Gift Tractor in the Mouth,\" Hooterville is beginning to look like Peyton Place when Doris Ziffel (Barbara Pepper) becomes convinced that her husband Fred (Hank Patterson) and Lisa are having an affair. \"Lisa Bakes a Cake,\" in which Lisa lists Oliver in the phone book as an attorney, is about as flat and heavy as one of Lisa's infamous creations.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006TPE1U", "B000BITV1A", "B001E6JC30", "B008K1PX7Q", "B0025X4PBA", "B001BN4WHW", "B001NRPQKI", "B0009OUBPQ", "B001LM64VK", "B00FJO95TE", "B00DICPAMU", "B000HWZ4J8", "B00DXLO0D6", "B002AMVEHY", "B0009B16TO", "B000E33VZ4", "B00DXLO086", "B00HJQMFF6", "B000BT96OG", "B000EQ46HI", "B0050MB5AC", "B00A2L1CKO", "B001DHXT4I", "B002WIDRL2", "B0063FGERO", "B001MBTSTU", "B0002NY8PI", "B001DZOCZU", "B000B7HZUK", "B00005JNS8", "B0007KIFK0", "B000FSMEB0", "B000ASDFIQ", "B00000F61N", "B001N26GSE", "B00DXLO0BI", "B0018TN73Y", "B0077T5SBS", "B0009SCVBY", "B000EGDANO", "B001992NXI", "B000A6T1J0", "B000HEZEYG", "B0038SUBBO", "B005SQRYOG", "B00FFARI7I", "B000PISZ86", "B00HYXZ1PU", "B000NOK0J4", "B000YKYT1M", "B000V3JGIS", "B000NA21YA", "B000N6UF10", "B005SQRYRS", "B002AL2TQK", "B007R5S0YY", "B002OOWL16", "B000291Q3Y", "B0006BAWSI", "B0030BS1E8", "B008KZX7W0", "B0007Y08P6", "B00005JLIC", "B00H8KC1N4", "B001SLNPSO", "B0001DMXEC", "B003K1NGXE", "B000EXZFS0", "B00096S480", "B0000BV1XX", "B000E3L7EQ", "B006UI5ARY", "B0057IY5EW", "B000TJBNF8", "B000NVIGDY", "B005UFUU6E", "B00005JOEB", "B0006Z2L4W", "B00650RX90", "B0009NZMYC", "B0014FAIYS", "B00HJQM9ZM", "B00AADAEHQ", "B005BUA1F8", "B000H1RFF0", "B008D19WQ6", "B0096RC57O", "B000MGBSQC", "B002DPH91I", "B00280QNKG", "B0030U1TCK", "B001GMH8WE", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B001LRTT30", "B000E3L7FK", "B00008EY6N", "B00IS6WQ2S", "B00G5N6C8U", "B000AOEMU0", "B00GHH9HW2"], "bought_together": ["B0006TPE1U", "B000BITV1A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0006TPE1U", "B000BITV1A", "B00DXLO086", "B00144NHV0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14201}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 18.99, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0000V4906", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51254BVYJZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Green Acres: The Complete First Season"}
{"description": "TheUnderworldDVD has a powerful soundtrack that makes good use of ambient noises (e.g., bullet casings pinging on the floor) and has a clear, well-defined picture, which is especially impressive considering the film's predominant look is black leather at nighttime.  The first segment of the four-part, 54-minute documentary is mostly self-congratulation and plot summary (which is not necessarily a bad thing); more interesting are the creature effects and the actors learning how to do their own stunts.  If you were wondering if the voice of the Lycan Raze was really that deep, you can listen to him--actor/co-writer Kevin Grevioux--along with director Len Wiseman and co-writer Danny McBride on the first commentary track as they discuss breaking the rulebook for vampires and shooting in Budapest on a tiny $22 million budget.  The accent-heavy technical commentary discusses how the visual effects and sound design add to the film--one of their goals was to make Kate Beckinsale look \"sexy, stylish, and subversive.\"--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000F6IOC0", "B001HN697M", "B003Y5H5EW", "B0002KVUKM", "B0002J4X1Q", "0767834739", "B001JV5B12", "B000YPUF9W", "B002ZG98UA", "B009MO57H6", "0780624890", "B001AK3S4Y", "B001GUYB08", "B0007V6ITE", "B001F7MSFM", "B000F6IOBG", "B001GCUO0W", "B000FGGE68", "B005LAIHSG", "B0002YLCG0", "B0009MDPYM", "B000AYELVA", "0800195175", "B000069I1I", "B00005JKWJ", "B008OR5X4O", "B0000AXE8I", "B002GSXKNI", "B00005JKYX", "B004EPZ07K", "B005LAIH2C", "B003Y5H5F6", "B0000DKDUR", "B003HKN52U", "B002KX9CPO", "B005CFBZWK", "B00008AOVL", "B00IKM5LXG", "B001VLFE7Q", "B004LWZW42", "B001VLFE7G", "B0001BKAEY", "B005LAIH54", "B001QOGYFO", "B00005JL78", "B0000844I8", "B001PR0Y8K", "B005G4TJUC", "B002NXSRVG", "B00005JM5E", "B00AEBBA72", "B001L9EXUC", "B0007WFX62", "B0013J55B6", "B002O3Z50Q", "B00000JQB5", "B002ZG977Y", "B00003CXTA", "B000GCFO0I", "B0000959N0", "B00AEFXCLU", "B0001O3YD0", "B001OQCV6A", "B0002ZDVEU", "B002ZG98N2", "B005LAIIPS", "B000IHY9TS", "B00005JM5B", "B004LWZWGA", "B000P0J0AQ", "B0053FANPY", "B00AEFY5B6", "B0085A9HU6", "B000CEV4XQ", "B00005RHGK", "B0000E2R6P", "B0006SSOHC", "B000OVLBHG", "B00AEFYGBA", "B002TMI2A2", "B0002VEUV2", "B009YQJ322", "B000EHRVP6", "B003ZKBELG", "B00005JNJV", "B002DKGWSE", "B000VWYJ86", "B005LAIHYU", "B00003CXSD", "B0015XHP2C", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00AZTUUQK", "B004EPYZT4", "B000TGJ80S", "B00027JZ3E", "B001GKJ2E8", "B001VLBDD0", "0767803434", "B004LWZWFQ", "B00195FUDC"], "bought_together": ["B003Y5H5EW", "B001HN697M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003Y5H5EW", "B007WZTG1U", "B001VLFE7G", "B001HN697M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 128315}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.94, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0000VAFNQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412NSB5PCYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Underworld (Full Screen Special Edition)"}

{"description": "Somebody smart produced the director's commentary track forBig  Fish; they brought in an interviewer to keep Tim Burton on track, thus  avoiding those moments when a director gapes silently at his movie,  grasping for some fresh thought.

{"description": "Having scored a critical triumph withMean Streets, Martin Scorsese acceptedAlice Doesn't Live Here Anymoreas his first big-studio assignment, proving his versatility and further advancing his promising career. Hot offThe Exorcistwith her choice of projects at Warner Brothers, Ellen Burstyn sought a hot young talent (Scorsese was recommended by Francis Coppola) to direct Robert Getchell's fine, sensitive screenplay about Alice Wyatt, a newly-widowed 35-year-old lounge singer with a bratty 12-year-old son (Alfred Lutter) and a very uncertain future. Her pursuit of broken dreams lands her a waitressing job in an Arizona diner, where she befriends foul-mouthed Flo (Diane Ladd) and meets and falls in love with a divorced farmer (Kris Kristofferson).  With absolute authenticity of emotion and incident,Alice--which earned Burstyn a well-deserved Oscar&#xAE; and features supporting roles for futureTaxi Drivercostars Jodie Foster and Harvey Keitel--conveys a then-timely sense of strength and endurance from a single mother in desperate times. There have been several similar dramas made since 1974, butAlice(which inspired the popular TV sitcomsAliceandFlo) is still the best. Trivia buffs: Look closely for Ladd's daughter--a very young Laura Dern--and Scorsese as background extras in the diner scenes.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0033PSHDG", "B000WC39ZY", "B00006RCNV", "B004499LWG", "6305090580", "B00005U2K5", "B00BTYU3SK", "B0001CNRBG", "B001EKP5D2", "B004VJJF34", "B003O7I6SE", "B009TTGLJ2", "B00G3BRC24", "B0045HCJ76", "B00BWQU0RY", "6305941122", "B00GC2KI2U", "B0089BSLKS", "B00441GYRE", "B0012TIWTY", "B00KJFZZLU", "B0009WIE16", "B008FYZHHE", "B0007ZEOPK", "B00005JKGX", "B001KP2J6W", "B000059HAN", "6305882592", "B00441GYRO", "B000FDFFTS", "B008Y5OWSO", "B00HRISNPM", "6305999872", "6304907729", "B0000JBALO", "B0001US78G", "B000ZM1MG4", "B00005Q4CS", "B00CPTUOI2", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B0007XG4ZK", "B003VA3JTA", "B00HQI811Y", "B000OY8NFG", "B003V4JU1W", "B001VC99HQ", "B00DW5IKW0", "B00I4X8KU2", "B000G6BLY2", "B00000JZBX"], "bought_together": ["B0033PSHDG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0033PSHDG", "B00006RCNV", "6305882592", "B000WC39ZY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 53037}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.0, "brand": "Alice", "asin": "B000286RO8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JRZQAKWXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"}

{"description": "Cheers to Fox for even puttingGreg the Bunnyon the air, and jeers to Fox for yanking it after a mere season (an ignominious fate it shared withThe Ben Stiller ShowandAndy Richter Controls the Universe). Ripe for discovery, this cult-worthy 2002 series took its cue fromWho Framed Roger Rabbit, and anticipated the subversive Tony Award-winning Muppet spoofAvenue Qby imagining a world in which puppets (or, to be more PC: \"fabricated Americans\") live amongst humans. Greg, a sweet-natured bunny, lives with his best friend Jimmy (Seth Green), a slacker whose father, Gil (the inestimable Eugene Levy), is the director of the \"struggling,\" \"low-rated\" children's showSweetknuckle Junction. Greg prevails upon Jimmy to get him a job on the show, but Greg inadvertently finds himself replacing the star. the washed-up Rochester Rabbit. Jimmy signs on as the production assistant to watch over Greg, and to pursue the icy network executive, Alison (comedy siren Sarah Silverman). Rounding out the human cast is gun nut Junction Jack (Bob Gunton) and ditzy, puppet-loving (and we mean that literally) Dottie (Dina Walters).The puppet ensemble is no less impressive than the \"fleshies.\" There's Count Blah, a vampire with aSesame Streetcomplex and a penchant for punctuating his sentences with \"blah\"; Warren \"Professor Ape\" Demontague, a soused monkey with thespian pretensions (and an ongoing feud with neighbor Corey Feldman); Tardy Turtle, an appellation which, unfortunately, does not just refer to his lack of speed, and Susan, a monster who makes Janet Reno look like Salma Hayek. Profanity and crude behavior emanating from puppets is certainly good for some easy laughs (prepare for the worst when adorable laundry icon Snuggles enters a bathroom stall in the episode \"Father & Son Reunion\"). ButGreg the Bunnyplays it smart as well, with sly in-jokes and movie references (catch theKing Konghomage when an enraged Demontague jumps on Gil's shoulders in \"Blah Bawls\").

{"description": "The first and only spin-off ofBabylon 5, J. Michael Straczynski's short-lived sci-fi seriesCrusadehad its roots in theB5television movieA Call to Arms, in which Earth was battling a Drakh invasion at the end of the Shadow Wars. WhenCrusadebegins, the Drakh have released a deadly virus that threatens to wipe out all 10 billion humans living on Earth unless a cure can be found in five years. To take on this monumental task, Captain Matthew Gideon (Gary Cole) is assigned command of the state-of-the-art Destroyer-class shipExcalibur. His crew includes telepath John Matheson (Daniel Dae Kim); pompous but brilliant archaeologist-linguist Max Eilerson (David Allen Brooks); Dureena, a member of the Thieves' Guild and the last surviving member of her species (Carrie Dobro); medical officer Sarah Chambers (Marjean Holden); and technomage Galen (Peter Woodward).WhileBabylon 5had five years to develop into a powerful saga,Crusadehad its plug pulled after a mere 13 episodes (which were reordered for TNT's broadcast), and the series never really got its footing. Galen often took center stage, then disappeared for several episodes. Matheson was underutilized (other than to provide fans with clues about what happened in the Psi-Wars afterB5ended), and tough-guy Gideon bounced back and forth between his desire to save the human race and his own moral code. There were some good action scenes and intriguing concepts (developed in conjunction with the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory). Special effects sometimes were impressive and sometimes showed budget constraints, and we never really saw the power and scope of the mile-and-a-half-long ship, other than the cool bullet cars used to traverse its length. But it did have its moments. IfB5was the spiritual companion toStar Trek: Deep Space Ninewith its space-station setting and long story arc,Crusadewas more like a traditionalStar Treksetting, with mostly stand-alone episodes involving first contact with various species (even if, due to the nature of theExcalibur's quest, such species were usually extinct). And there were occasional tantalizing hints of a broader conspiracy that might have allowed the series to soar. Regardless,B5fans will welcome even a brief opportunity to revisit this universe, especially when theExcaliburvisits the station in \"The Rules of the Game.\" John Sheridan's ex-wife Captain Elizabeth Lochley (Tracy Scoggins) even earned a spot in the opening credits for her appearance in a few episodes.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004EXWGHY", "B000CEXFYW", "B000PHX8RA", "B002DUJ9Q6", "B002BAW6GS", "B002BAW6H2", "B002BAW6FY", "B002BAW6GI", "B002BAW6FE", "B000JLTRHW", "B000ELL1QC", "B000BCCAEQ", "B00F3L8P26", "B0009JE6G6", "B00005NTNP", "B00404ME2E", "B003H9LIU2", "B0009JE6FM", "B006LPHY6G", "B006P2TA44", "B000FIHN8O", "B001RHGRTS", "B000FJH5M2", "B0006FO9B0", "B001DF681G", "B00KC57IWG", "B000E5N6B6", "B007AFC0W4", "B000FOPPBA", "B004HYW84G", "B001DW2BG0", "B003Y7JWZ0", "B004TJ1H3C", "B0051GOB2G", "B0048FUUAI", "B003ZFC9M4", "B003H9LIRK", "B008R52LA2", "B0042YZFYG", "B0041B77RS", "B00IWTVDUW", "B00402FGE4", "B000BOH8Y6", "B000BR9SA0", "B00BN0WQ5I", "B00GX7D5G0", "B0000V4910", "B00A3718IS", "B000HCO8KE", "B002ZCY872", "B0015LPS1Y", "B002USF1UO", "B00E688AZE", "B00466H3A4", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B003BV8I7C", "B000W4KT9G", "B002GP7ZWI", "B004LROMWU", "B00K2CHWYI", "B00465I156", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00HUPC5X8", "B003PGNBO8", "B00170LCWC", "B0057FGD3Q", "B000WLU5ZM", "B00062RCC6", "B001RTCP1U", "B00L4K3MLE", "B00023BKMC", "B004LROMS4", "B002CLKP00", "B0000AQS0F", "B00KO7NUWO", "B000WTZ6SK", "B00E0KY62O", "B003R0MEYA", "B0007CEXUY", "B00HXEWECI", "B00E688720", "B00E3QJ7JC", "B00K2CHVSK", "B000V5IP6K", "B00ECXJC28", "B002VA5A02", "0345427173", "B00A3717C0", "B002U0KHME", "B00J82PU92", "0739414852", "B00KM5F31O", "B000FJH5MC", "B001RXDM2M", "B001EN71CW", "B002HRF7AW", "B0041OOSMC", "B007XF0XVQ", "B008XJM6H0", "B00HWWUQYY"], "bought_together": ["B004EXWGHY", "B002DUJ9Q6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004EXWGHY", "B002BAW6H2", "B002DUJ9Q6", "B00F3L8P26"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6775}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 15.69, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B00061QJSK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ATW37CMGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Crusade: The Complete Series"}

{"description": "Unrequited homosexual yearning explodes in a coastal hospital just after the Spanish Civil War.  Parental advisory: graphic violence and sex. Set against the backdrop of the Spanish Civil War and its aftermath, El Mar tells the story of three young friends, Tur, Ramallo, and Francisca, who witness a brutal killing when a classmate avenges his father's assassination upon another schoolmate, and then kills himself shortly thereafter.  This secret will haunt Tur, Ramallo, and Francisca for the rest of their lives.  Years later, the muscled, womanizing Ramallo reunites with his childhood friends when all three find themselves quarantined in a tuberculosis sanatorium.  Ramallo, hiding a secret rent-boy past, bristles against the mandatory isolation.  Tur, now thin and pale, leans on religious fanaticism to avoid acting on his sexual urges towards Ramallo.  Francisca, now one of the nuns, helps ease the pain of the dying.  Together again in this lonely outpost by the sea, they revisit their dark childhood and quickly become tormented by death, religion, and sex.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00GHP8SH4", "B0099PW0D2", "B00FPVGWY2", "B00005QAPW", "B0008ENHXA", "B004L03B3S", "B00AWQEK26", "B005OTQIK8", "B000CR7R7K", "1572522178", "B0000DC150", "B008N25X7M", "B0009MAPKO", "B0001KNHAO", "B004FSXRMQ", "B000VFIDP8", "B000056B0E", "B000EGEKRO", "B000EGDBHY", "B000YMDJ02", "B0000584ZI", "B001OSC4BK", "B00064AFFA", "B001AOC9K4", "B00ADU287U", "B000WC3ARG", "B00005KCB2", "B00008AOTW", "B000RW5CCC", "B00014NEFI", "B001OSC4BA", "B00GNTK85O", "B00BJRYJ1O", "B0000DD75N", "B00004UEDZ", "B0038M61J6", "B000O76TPY", "B003BV8HVE", "B003ZTDZVY", "B000FDE5DA", "B001UDPAAG", "B000067J4I", "B000HC2M16", "B004XVMCM6", "B002HP4LH4", "B0007LBM2M", "B00JVX8194", "B0036FLDQG", "B000NHHFEE", "B00008YLU4", "B00006SFL5", "B000MGBM2C", "B001PNTU0M", "B001CT05N0", "B00006SFL3", "B00007M5KD", "B0009NCPZ6", "B00AFQSYCK", "B0002TT09G", "B000PE0EXE", "B0085OVDW2", "B00191AEZK", "B000JSI7F8", "B003XRH9Z6", "B009PJ1S5S", "B004PQBYVE", "B0007XG01S", "B005GM38JW", "B00005MALV", "B000088UZ4", "B00BSHYZGY", "B001ANQY92", "B000EMG93Q", "B002PCVLX6", "B000B5Y0D2", "B00013WVI0", "B0089N7STG", "B004MUHOSU", "B0000541AE", "B000I8OMBM", "B0044LYRFK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004L03B3S", "B00005UF80"]}, "price": 16.18, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 297402}, "asin": "B00066FC4W", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5122W77B7QL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "El Mar"}

{"description": "From its charming and angst-ridden first season to the darker, apocalyptic final one, Buffy the Vampire Slayer succeeds on many levels, and in a fresher and more authentic way than the shows that came before or after it. How lucky, then, that with the release of its boxed set of seasons 1-7, you can have the estimable pleasure of watching a near-decade of Buffy in any order you choose. (And we have some ideas about how that should be done.)\n\nFirst: rest assured that there's no shame in coming to Buffy late, even if you initially turned your nose up at the winsome Sarah Michelle Gellar kicking the hell out of vampires (in Buffy-lingo, vamps), demons, and other evil-doers. Perhaps you did so because, well, it looked sort of science-fiction-like with all that monster latex. Start with season 3 and see that Buffy offers something for everyone, and the sooner you succumb to it, the quicker you'll appreciate how textured and riveting a drama it is.\n\nWhy season 3? Because it offers you a winning cast of characters who have fallen from innocence: their hearts have been broken, their egos trampled in typically vicious high-school style, and as a result, they've begun to realize how fallible they are. As much as they try, there are always more monsters, or a bigger evil. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, the core crew remains something of a unit--there's the smart girl, Willow (Alyson Hannigan) who dreams of saving the day by downloading the plans to City Hall's sewer tunnels and mapping a route to safety.

{"description": "Set in San Francisco, family-friendly sitcomFull Housecenters around the adventures of a widowed father, his three children, and his two best friends. Danny (Bob Saget ofAmerica's Funniest Home Videos) is a straight-laced sportscaster, Joey (David Coulier) is a fun-loving stand-up comedian, and brother-in-law Jesse (John Stamos) is an Elvis-obsessed rocker. Danny's children include 11-year-old D.J. (Candace Cameron), five-year-old Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin), and baby Michelle (big-eyed future superstars Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen). Created by Jeff Franklin (Laverne and Shirley), the show ran on ABC for eight seasons.In the pilot, \"Our Very First Show,\" Joey and Jesse, who are both looking for a place to live, move into Danny's townhouse after the death of his wife (who was killed by a drunk driver). The deal is that they'll have to help look after the kids. It's a task for which both men are ill equipped. The fun comes from the trouble the girls get into each week and the many messes Joey and Jesse create in their attempts to set things right--particularly when it comes to cooking, cleaning, and diaper-changing--but also from the cheesy 1980s styles on display, like Jesse's big hair, spandex pants, and string ties.The Complete First Seasonincludes all 22 episodes plus the original un-aired pilot with John Posey as Danny. (In Franklin's commentary on \"Our Very First Show,\" he notes that Paul Reiser was also considered for the role.) Noteworthy guest stars include Phyllis Diller (\"But Seriously Folks\"), Stacy Q (\"D.J. Tanner's Day Off'), and Candace's brother Kirk \"Growing Pains\" Cameron (\"Just One of the Guys\"). WhileFull Housewas never a magnet for major awards, the program developed a large following during its long run (while the house got fuller yet), followed by an even longer after-life in syndication.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM is one fo Shakespeare's earliest comedies yet still resounds with the brilliance and charm of his later works.  Directed by Peter Hall using THE ROYAL SHAKESPEARE ACADEMY's cast of actors, this 1968 version is one of the wittiest and wildest of all versions to be produced.  Hermia (Helen Mirren) is in love with Lysander (David Warner) but are forbidden to marry.  Together they set off into the enchanted wood to live together in happiness.  Unknown to them, the couple is followed by Demetrius (Michael Jayston) who loves Hermia.  Demtrius in turn is followed by Helena (Diana Rig) for she is in love with him.  Their collective adventures are further compounded by the inhabitants of the wood the Faeries.  Oberon (Ian Richardson) and Titania (Judi Dench), the King and Queen of the Faeries, helped by Oberon's servant Puck (Ian Holm), cast the lovers into turmoil through their magic and their own jealousies.  With its cast of great performers, this film version of  A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM is a hilarious and tremendous production of one of the Bard's greatest work. A must have for all fans of Shakespeare.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000QGE8JC", "6305622876", "B0051HCUMS", "B0052SO010", "B004M9ZI0M", "B008H6GHE2", "B001TR4G6W", "B0000714BZ", "B00CDV4JNS", "B00000JL7T", "B00005JLCI", "B0013D8LWC", "B0007WRT4Q", "B00443FMKM", "B007RP4CAA", "B0002TVWYW", "B00DQN6IOK", "B00A7OBIGO", "B00B6OEEKQ", "B000QGE8IS", "B00005S872", "B00ECR7KX2", "0780021312", "1932219242", "0769712231", "B00AJER4EM", "B00019072G", "B0038RSJ0U", "B007RP4BZ6", "0780021320", "B00B2BYY1W", "B000063JZQ", "B00AMEZDPG", "1586638483", "079284615X", "B000HWZ4AC", "B00006G8HO", "B00B1E6EAY", "B0059XTUR2", "B0012EM5CE", "B001LPWGHS", "B007CJL17S", "B005COLEOA", "B000E6ESKS", "B008D1A18E", "B0073U2EWM", "B00HHYF55C", "B004SIP83Y", "1907127283", "B00004Z4WW", "B00063MC1Q", "B007I1Q50S", "B00GWXI20E", "0792844041", "B000K7VHLY", "B000BP86VE", "B003H0ZGWW", "B00ECR7L0Y", "B004P29LDG", "B007H7OQW2", "B0002235QM", "B00005Q313", "B000OY9VFW", "B002E01MBA", "B0001BKAMQ", "B005SYZYYK", "B001O7R75O", "0743288505", "B004SIP9U6", "0743482816", "B003TRS8XM", "B00E5G03I4", "B0000APNTV", "B002SF9YUC", "B002L5NYMS", "B00JAQJMJ0", "0743484908", "B00BJC90D6", "B00AZFECHW", "0385722141", "0743288491", "B00BBXRKHQ", "B004AUCCZ2", "1903436605", "B000001GM6", "B004H0M31I", "B000ETRCN0", "B0000640VK", "0743288513", "B0007XG52C", "B006JDD80Q", "B00A27O5AW", "B000XUF6BU", "0140291172", "0812035844", "B00AZMFO6I", "B004UOHNAC", "B001QV6KL0", "B003RHZ6DY", "B004Q8D1FS"], "bought_together": ["B000QGE8JC", "6305622876"], "buy_after_viewing": ["6305622876", "B000QGE8JC", "B0052SO010", "B0051HCUMS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 126802}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 20.23, "brand": "", "asin": "B0007CNXV4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61B42R4W6SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Midsummer Night's Dream"}

It is the story of a 12-year-old boy, David, who escapes a Communist concentration camp with little more than a compass, a sealed letter, a loaf of bread, and instructions to carry the letter to Copenhagen, Denmark. David is thrust into the free world for the first time in his young life as he travels across Europe. It is a spiritual voyage of discovery, where David slowly loses his instinctual mistrust of humanity and begins to smile, share, trust and ultimately, love. I Am David addresses the cruelties, politics, and suffering of warfare while celebrating the resilience of youth and the unbreakable spirit of a child.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0152051600", "B00DCRE87O", "B000A50442", "B000HC2LZS", "B000BKDO6Q", "B00006ADFM", "B002U0KHNS", "B00004YA66", "B001EAWMGA", "B00005PJ8T", "B00006HAZH", "B00062IVOY", "B0007939YI", "0812469666", "B00079HZOS", "1404104968", "B004SEUJ82", "B000NVI0DU", "B002TZS58I", "B0014BQR6U", "B0054PSY5O", "006440577X", "B004SIP8W0", "B0000633QW", "B0000DZTIS", "0152575537", "B00GHU35HM", "B00G15MDI0", "B003JLL2RW", "B001FES0JI", "1440436185", "B003YKYX7Y", "B002NZK5UK", "B00006IUFW", "B00003CXBH", "B000KB48NE", "B0083TUE7E", "B004KL0OVU", "0152164278", "B009LDD1H6", "B000EDG2DW", "B007A2O3FO", "B0000CE684", "006440174X", "B00008J2PG", "B000NVT0SO", "B00860YICC", "B000EQ5T1K", "0440407591", "B001NSLE5I", "B000E1ZBFY", "B000VNMMQG", "B000811672", "B006VRRGRG", "B00116GEFM", "B00308BAXK", "B000MTEKGO", "B000QUU7KC", "B000N4SHOE", "B000BITUVG", "B00009QUH4", "6305428395", "B00HW3EJQE", "B0007SWPV2", "B000FDFSYA", "B00005JLD4", "B00AKIPAG6", "B000G6BLYM", "B00H83EUQW", "B0006Q93H4", "B0054DPLUC", "B00HUFCKB0", "1586178350", "0764210696", "B002LDCZCU", "B005OZVXCU", "B0009WFF68", "B00005JN8Z", "B000PFUA7S", "B0006GANX2", "B000BB1520", "B000BITVAG", "B0046WCM7M", "B00020HAXS", "B0011FDVGI", "B002O3Z4WU"], "bought_together": ["0152051600"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0152051600", "B00006ADFM", "B00004YA66", "B000A50442"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12493}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.92, "brand": "LION&#39;S GATE ENTERTAINMENT", "asin": "B0007N19X2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AF6ZJA70L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "I Am David"}

{"description": "Geoffrey Rush is in bravura form in his shape-shifting performance as one of the cinema's great chameleons:  Peter Sellers. This higgledy-piggledy biopic races across the high and low points of Sellers's adult life, pretty much sticking to the standard explanation (endorsed by Sellers himself) that his genius for mimickry and impersonation was the result of lacking a personality of his own. Sellers's monstrous treatment of wives and colleagues is balanced by his childlike enthusiasms, all nicely captured by Rush. As for the re-creations of Sellers routines fromThe Goon ShoworDr. Strangelove, Rush gives it a game and sometimes inspired go. Other characters are as incidental as they seem to have been to Sellers himself, with Miriam Margolyes (as Peter's grasping, goading mother) and Emily Watson (patient first wife) especially good. Charlize Theron is Britt Ekland, with little more to do than adopt a Swedish accent. The events chosen to illustrate Sellers's neuroses seem random--from a drawn-out infatuation with Sophia Loren to his feud with Blake Edwards--and the film piles up until Sellers's heart finally gives out. This middling life story could have made, and deserves, a great documentary.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001IHJ988", "B001IHJ974", "B001LXIDUY", "B000055Y0X", "B00003CXPV", "B00AEBB8ZG", "B0016LFG5Q", "B00007AJE1", "B000CQLZ8S", "B0009IW8OE", "0786885815", "B002S5N052", "B00BTYJYOY", "B0045O2PHS", "B000LAZDPG", "B004SIP6C2", "B0015OKWK8", "B0009S4J3C", "B0001AG01M", "B0006J27WO", "B0000AUHPB", "B003NTUOGU", "0780620887", "0780628551", "B0009S4J3M", "B0057UA4CW", "B00009MEKJ", "B004SUDQAE", "B001US0P7E", "6305781095", "B0015OKWKI", "B00FF9SKQW", "B00003CY6A", "B004P7CMVE", "B00000JGOI", "B004YCKKFK", "B004SIP9CO", "B008XAT0TQ", "0860516342", "B0008ENFWI", "B0002CHIKG", "6305065551", "B0016Q2D66", "B00AEFXCLU", "B000F7CMRM", "B0006TPE4C", "B003NTVW7U", "B000MQ54M6", "B0001Y9YJ8", "B008FYZIEQ", "B00006RCNV", "B00J2PQZEY", "B0007P0YKY", "B00005JKH9", "B0054WPX56", "B0011V7PSC", "B00006L91I", "B0007XBKP4", "B0000BXMZ2", "B000BX8R10", "B0001XAOBG", "0786866640", "6305291470", "B004SIP7VM", "B0000VD04M", "155783248X", "0783116764", "B0060ZJ7DA", "B00000IC7G", "B000KWZ7JC", "B00000IQC0", "B000C3L2PC", "B00004XPPE", "6305594333", "1557833575", "B000093NR0", "B0013D8L7C", "B00DM3TKNU", "B0036VHJ5Y", "B000M341SC", "B0083QN87K", "B00C1AIMXE", "B0039UU3EQ", "B00005RDRO", "B00H9L28OO", "B00004STRD", "B00004XPPK", "B003WKL6YO", "B0010AN7Z4", "B00094ARN2", "B002GIBVWA", "B0013D8LKO", "B00020X88Y", "B00H9KKKAY", "B002ZG980U", "B004499LX0", "B00003CXBZ", "B00D2CYU2W", "0792833287", "B00006ADD5"], "bought_together": ["B001IHJ988", "B000055Y0X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0089J27VY", "B001IHJ988", "155783248X", "B0001AG01M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 120642}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.45, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0007R4SX6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51cVHGYUFzL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Life and Death of Peter Sellers"}

His wife (Naomi Watts) has left him, his dead-end sales job is killing him--even his best friend (Don Cheadle) has had enough. Bicke's a loser, but at least he's an honest one. Nixon, the epitome of dishonesty, becomes the locus of his rage, so Bicke devises a plan to eliminate him. Paul Schrader claims he finished writingTaxi Driverbefore the real-life Byck attempted to assassinate the president. Maybe so, but the similarities are hard to ignore (and \"Bickle\" sounds a lot like \"Byck\"). Niels Mueller (Tadpole) doesn't disguise the fact that his debut was inspired by the guy.

{"description": "Glamorous Maddie Hayes (Cybill Shepherd) is an ex-model with a problem--her accountant just ran off with her money. Granted, he did leave her with a few broken-down businesses. One happens to be a detective agency run by charming loudmouth David Addison (Bruce Willis). Her attempt to shutter the agency fails when they stumble across a crime and David convinces Maddie to help him solve it. And with that, one of television's most popular partnerships was born.Moonlightingmade a star out of newcomer Willis and turned Shepherd (Taxi Driver), who had already found fame through fashion and film, into a bona fide TV star.Created for ABC by Glenn Gordon Caron (Remington Steele), the romantic comedy/detective drama was a mid-season replacement that quickly became a hit. There were only six episodes in the first season, including the two-part pilot, but 18 were produced for the second. Rhyming receptionist Agnes DiPesto (Allyce Beasley) was a regular from the start, while Herbert Viola (Ray&#x92;s Curtis Armstrong) wouldn&#x92;t hit the scene until the third season (as with Paul Sorvino and Mark Harmon). The first two seasons attracted an eclectic array of guest stars, including Tim Robbins (\"Gunfight at the So-So Corral\"), Beasley's husband Vincent Schiavelli (\"Next Stop Murder\"), Dana Delany (\"Knowing Her\"), Richard Belzer (\"Twas the Episode Before Christmas\"), and Whoopi Goldberg (\"Camille\"), who earned an Emmy nomination for her performance. The most notable guest was surely Orson Welles, who introduces the black and white noir spoof \"The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice.\" It would be his final TV appearance.Moonlightingran for three more years. While the Emmy-winning Willis would abandon TV for the big screen, Shepherd found subsequent small screen success withCybill. Caron, meanwhile, would launch another mid-season replacement series which became a surprise hit: NBC'sMediumwith Patricia Arquette.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Au hazard Balthazarcan have a profoundly moving effect on those who are sensitive to its power. Like any film by Robert Bresson, it provokes widely different responses: Many critics have hailed it as a masterpiece, while others (as Pauline Kael observed) \"may find it painstakingly tedious and offensively holy.\" It all depends on what the viewer brings to Bresson's seemingly simple tale of a donkey named Balthazar, who experiences kindness and cruelty as he is passed from owner to owner. Populated by a variety of sinners and saints alike, the film can be seen as a simple animal fable, as Balthazar suffers nobly at the hands of his handlers. Dig deeper into Bresson's art, however, and you're likely to find a very Catholic story with strong parallels to the life of Christ and his unbearable burden of the sins of mankind.No matter how you approach the film, only the most cold-hearted viewer will be immune to Balthazar's fate. And if you're not sure what to make of it all, this superb Criterion DVD offers two essential bonus features to guide you toward a greater understanding of Bresson's approach to cinema: Film scholar and devoted \"Bressonian\" Donald Richie offers his astute observations in a 2004 video interview, and in an in-depth French TV appearance from 1966, Bresson talks at length aboutAu hazard Balthazaralong with fellow directors Louis Malle and Jean-Luc Godard, and members of the film's cast and crew. This is a remarkable document from a bygone era, when \"art film\" was at its peak, and directors (especially French ones) were eager to discuss the intellectual significance of their work. Kudos to Criterion for including this archival gem of film appreciation.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BB14IA", "B000K0YLX2", "B00AQ6J6H6", "B001LMU19G", "0780022343", "B000087EY6", "6305257450", "6305744114", "B008DL4K8Q", "B00005M2C7", "B005152C7S", "B000127IF2", "B00AQ6J3AG", "B000C8Q900", "B00005JLV7", "B00EO2I6W4", "B009VO9XSG", "B001TIQT7A", "B00HE011DE", "B0007989Y8", "B000I8OOG0", "B0007OC6ZG", "B00005BHW6", "B001UF5KOU", "B0000A02TX", "B001TIQT6G", "B00GA9F2PI", "B00CUKTHJ8", "B009RWRIMA", "B0016AKSOG", "B000BB14I0", "B000N2HBIO", "B006X96PBU", "B00005UQ7T", "B000093NR0", "B00HVOFP6W", "B00005EBSF", "B00009ME9Z", "B005HK13S6", "B000BR6QIW", "B00BX49B0C", "B000AQKUG8", "B00180R06I", "B00KE3B6NI", "B001BEK8C4", "B004WPYO7E", "B00DHN8GQ2", "B00KE3B6LA", "B001LMU1C8", "B000E5LEV0", "B005152CC8", "6305131104", "B0001GH5RY", "B001ILTUKG", "B0016B6ZEC", "B002BWP4A6", "B001298BPY", "B000C8Q8ZQ", "B002U6DVQ2", "B007A9EGB8", "B00005NC66", "B004NWPY20", "B00000F7E6", "B001BEK8CE", "B00GBT629C", "B00DZP1C3Q", "B000PKG6O4", "B00A8QDHYW", "6305081034", "B002AFX53C", "B001LMU1B4", "B00HVOFP08", "B00004Z1FM", "B000EOTWIS", "B005HK13OK", "B00DZP1BUU", "B0035G5IOE", "B000M2E3GS", "B004CGUC10", "B00005QAPH", "B00005QAPJ", "B007A9EGC2", "B001WLMOL4", "B000IHYXH6", "B0000633SD", "B000HKH0WY", "B000FUF7CQ", "B000XQ4HQO", "B00JGR3M26", "B004NWPY34", "B00L3ZB7PS", "B00023P4N8", "B008CJ0JS4", "B00003CXUM", "B00GG0NABE", "B0007989ZC", "B001IZNIV4", "B005VU9LP4", "B000093NQY", "0292776241"], "bought_together": ["B000BB14IA", "B000K0YLX2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001EOQCJE", "6305428239", "B001QOGYBI", "B0000640VJ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 88549}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 20.17, "brand": "WIAZEMSKY,ANNE", "asin": "B00092ZLEY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41MLI-OZspL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Au Hasard Balthazar (The Criterion Collection)"}
{"description": "Startling in its blunt portrait of a man who fears he will lose his humanity by assuming control of a family business--and who then goes on to lose precisely that--The Inheritancewon six Danish Academy Awards, including one for writer-director Per Fly. The second in an ambitious trilogy about class struggles planned by Fly,The Inheritancestars Ulrich Thomsen as Christoffer, a successful restaurateur living happily with a beautiful actress, Maria (Lisa Werlinder). Having fled responsibility for helping run his family's steel business--a miserable time for Christoffer that cost him his health and self-respect--the happy hero finds himself squeezed by his manipulative mother (Ghita Norby) into becoming CEO following his father's suicide. In short order, Christoffer finds himself doing everything he considers despicable: firing loyal employees, jockeying for greater power, forcing out other family members. Fly's somber, low-key storytelling doesn't have to drive home the slow drama of Christoffer's moral and ethical deconstruction. It's a compelling if painful thing to behold, and Thomsen's performance as a man who gets away from himself is something to see.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007IO74U", "B002TZS5GK", "B000X4ZGSE", "B000ADWDF2", "B001T46TBK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002I83T0", "1892649357", "B00062IZ0Y", "B001T46TBK"]}, "price": 14.89, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 243064}, "asin": "B00097DXSA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515g2eJz4LL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Inheritance"}

{"description": "Gate of Flesh(Nikutai no mon) is another wonderful example of why Seijun Suzuki will go down in history as one of Japan's craftiest and most ingenious B-movie directors. As exhibited inBranded to KillandTokyo DrifterSuzuki has the uncanny ability to take shoestring budgets, predictable boilerplate scripts, tight schedules, and studio-contracted actors and spin these elements to create extremely deep and layered films.Gate of Fleshis no exception.  In post-World War II Japan, life on the Tokyo streets has become desperate. Amidst the ruins, a tough, well-worn group of prostitutes bands together for survival and companionship. When an ex-soldier enters into the circle, flames of jealousy, anger, and lust are fueled, ending with disastrous results.  On the surface, the story is a simple pulp tale of decadence thrown together by Nikkatsu Studios to make a quick buck. But, in the hands of Suzuki-san,Gate of Fleshturns into a hallucinatory, surreal, critical post-modern essay on the decline of loyalty and morality in modern society.--Rob Bracco", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009HLCW4", "B0006HC0FU", "B0006HC0F0", "B00KSPST6Y", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B00092ZLG2", "B00B2BYXYA", "B005ND87L8", "B000GI430E", "B000NOK0GW", "B001TIQT7A", "B00393SFQG", "B00GBT62PQ", "078002205X", "B001U3TPPC", "B002AFX53W", "B00J2PQZRQ", "B001CW7ZTE", "B000PKG6O4", "B00GPPXNEE", "B000AQKUC2", "B00HVOFP6W", "B000OONPKO", "B00009MEA0", "B0007WFYC0", "B000BR6QCI", "B004GFGUEK", "B00HVOFP9O", "B00687XO1G", "B00HE01030", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B0001A79BW", "B0000560QE", "B00EO2I6OM", "B00GOT15IM", "B007N5YK10", "B004NWPY4I", "B00GPPXNLC", "B001O549GG", "B0006Z2NB8", "B00HI9QDXO", "B0001UZZSG", "B008XEZXV6", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B00B2BYXWM", "B005ND87Y0", "B0001A79C6", "B000A88ERS", "B000M2E3FY", "B00F98FOFY", "B004S8021M", "B0026VBOJM", "B00FB349R6", "B000S0GYRK", "B000AQKUG8", "B000M2E3FE", "B004NWPY6Q", "B00HE010LC", "B00008RH14", "B000AQKUD6", "B003U6SJY0", "B005ND87RM", "B00026L7MC", "B00687XNNK", "B00152VXU8", "B0009VRHLK", "B000BC8SWO", "B0007989YS", "B005D0RDPM", "B0006Z2NAO", "B008Y5OXDI", "B001570H5K", "B000KRNGNQ", "B003N2CVQ8", "B00A8QDHYW", "B007N5YJZM", "B00DPUB56U", "B00004W3HF", "B0016AKSOQ", "B000MTEFPA", "B0035ECI12", "B000PKG6OY", "B005152CAA", "B001BEK8F6", "B00CUKTHD4", "B0009S2T0M", "B001LMU19G", "B004NWPXZS", "B000JVSUNE", "B0007TZHWA", "B001BEK8CE", "B00AQ6J536", "B0007WFYBG", "B005D0RDCU", "B00199PPE2", "B00006673L", "B00AY6PK5A", "B001PYD0LQ", "B00GPPXNIK", "B001LMU1C8"], "bought_together": ["B0009HLCW4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00092ZLG2", "078002205X", "B0009HLCW4", "B000065V38"]}, "price": 24.86, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 220211}, "asin": "B0009HLCUQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515WXXX9FRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gate of Flesh (The Criterion Collection)"}

In due time, however, they come to an understanding and embark on a tentative affair, despite Anna's faith in the hearings and Langston's doubts.

It's non-stop action as Ting infiltrates Bangkok's seedy underworld and takes on a series of lowlifes and criminals in his quest to obtain the sacred head.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002XTXGA2", "B004BZ5ADW", "B000I0RNWU", "B003INBNXO", "B001L67A4G", "B004I1AGTC", "B002DHACS8", "B000K2UW06", "B00JVQ7RCS", "B005ZMBEXU", "B003EVAG4C", "B004U7MR1O", "B004U7MR0K", "B004P8R9O8", "B003DVB7F0", "B0085A9J18", "B003FXXNH6", "B004GJYRKA", "B0016MJ6JC", "B000GPPPTK", "B004SIP88Y", "B00J5LXST0", "B000K7UC2Y", "B0054EKDEU", "B002XTXFTE", "B00005YUNV", "B004H2CXBQ", "B000GFLKDU", "B00369ERCY", "B00008EY6M", "B00B6OEE7O", "B000QGEB12", "B002C6VMIY", "B00284G2BC", "B001MEJY9G", "B000MM0LEG", "B000HC2M3Y", "B000EE3FUY", "B0055CP9EK", "B006C1S1DY", "B004XQO8MS", "B0019F02U8", "B004326EV0", "0780619331", "B00ATXIJOC", "B0030A6ICG", "B005E7SEZW", "B0031L5CTO", "B00005B1X4", "B00ET2ODYY", "B003M9ZABU", "B002FU8JTW", "B00EI3Y1QO", "B000A2IPQY", "B00003CXR4", "B000ICLU7C", "B005F96UGO", "B001BEK8HO", "B0018PH3NS", "B0046H0I0K", "B004XVMCPI", "B001EI5C5U", "B005NQ5LQ4", "B000N4SHNK", "B006LOC01G", "B005KK2FWG", "B004BZ5AM8", "B00AKB8OZC", "B003YOZNFQ", "B001MEJY9Q", "B009VL2A5M", "B003LN0NXC", "B004I7F862", "B00HSJ2EMI", "B0056OZI0W", "B0007Q6VXC", "B004VW4V9E", "B00003CY5A", "B004SUDQAY", "B00C3ALL9O", "B0019PL2W0", "B005F96UHI", "B003G715IK", "B0010X740K", "B000V6I7N0", "B008IG0B0C", "B008XEZXES", "B005FQ1OOK", "B00005AWRA", "B0056OZI0M", "B00GXFZOYI", "B0035V35P8", "B002XTBE5Q", "B0000DD76R", "B000I2KOB0", "B000MRA592", "B0010X741O", "B006L4MWVE", "B0056NEK1G"], "bought_together": ["B002XTXGA2", "B004BZ5ADW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000I0RNWU", "B0085A9J18", "B002XTXGA2", "B004BZ5ADW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 40082}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 20.0, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B0009VBTQY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J0YJPHB2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ong-Bak - The Thai Warrior"}
{"description": "Whoever persuaded MGM to make a movie about giant, bloodthirsty bunnies must have been some kind of mad genius.Night of the Lepusfeatures Stuart Whitman (star of such classics asOmega CopandDemonoid, Messenger of Death) and Janet Leigh (whose career had taken a downturn fromPsycho) as a pair of scientists who say things like \"I wish I knew what the effects of this serum would be--let's hope it works\" as they inject test rabbits with hormones that turn them into slavering, carnivorous giant bunnies. That's the plot; the rest of the movie is scenes of giant bunnies attacking horses, giant bunnies jumping through windows to attack people, giant bunnies running in herds down the freeway...lots and lots of giant bunnies, sometimes with blood smeared across their ferocious jaws as they rear up to attack. The special effects are breathtakingly cheap; the bloody corpses are actors with red syrup splashed over them. But what makesNight of the Lepuseven more astonishing is that the dvd features dubbing in French, presumably for European viewers bored with their usual diet of Truffaut and Rohmer. In fact, the movie makes more sense in French (assuming you don't actually speak the language); you can pretend it was created by an inspired Surrealist, and that Janet Leigh says things like \"My bicycle has wheels of cheese\" or \"Beauty kisses my savage earlobe,\" instead of \"Rabbits aren't exactly Roy's bag.\" Also starring Rory Calhoun (Roller Blade Warriors: Taken by Force) and DeForest Kelley (Dr. McCoy on the originalStar Trek), who wears several colorful turtlenecks.

{"description": "Movie studios, by and large, avoid controversial subjects like race the way you might avoid a hive of angry bees. So it's remarkable thatCrasheven got made; that it's a rich, intelligent, and moving exploration of the interlocking lives of a dozen Los Angeles residents--black, white, latino, Asian, and Persian--is downright amazing. A politically nervous district attorney (Brendan Fraser) and his high-strung wife (Sandra Bullock, biting into a welcome change of pace fromMiss Congeniality) get car-jacked by an oddly sociological pair of young black men (Larenz Tate and Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges); a rich black T.V. director (Terrence Howard) and his wife (Thandie Newton) get pulled over by a white racist cop (Matt Dillon) and his reluctant partner (Ryan Phillipe); a detective (Don Cheadle) and his Latina partner and lover (Jennifer Esposito) investigate a white cop who shot a black cop--these are only three of the interlocking stories that reach up and down class lines. Writer/director Paul Haggis (who wrote the screenplay forMillion Dollar Baby) spins every character in unpredictable directions, refusing to let anyone sink into a stereotype. The cast--ranging from the famous names above to lesser-known but just as capable actors like Michael Pena (Buffalo Soldiers) and Loretta Devine (Woman Thou Art Loosed)--meets the strong script head-on, delivering galvanizing performances in short vignettes, brief glimpses that build with gut-wrenching force.

{"description": "Huge muscular men bashing each other senseless with their feet, fists, knees, and elbows--if this is your catnip,The Ultimate Fighter -Season 1is for you! This reality show, presented by the Ultimate Fighting Championship, puts 16 slabs of beef (all of them versed in boxing, wrestling, and every martial art imaginable) into a house as they undergo even more rigorous training and periodic elimination bouts in the Octogon.  The show swiftly makes it clear that physical skill is only part of the picture; drive and sheer will to dominate matter just as much as muscle power (if not more). Under the guiding hand of UFC stars Randy Couture and Chuck Liddell, the aspiring champions train and compete in group challenges, all the while partying and bickering back at the house. The camera gets a good look at the fighters' emotional lives. Though generally stone-faced, over thirteen episodes (including the final bouts, which were originally broadcast live) the competitors prove to be an interesting mix of loudmouths, good guys, and underdogs, some of whom are unexpectedly vulnerable. But the soap opera is just a bonus. This show is about men facing each other in the ring, and it delivers.

{"description": "It was the greatest flood of the past two million years, and it posed a giant scientific riddle. A maverick geologist became convinced that thousand-foot-deep floodwaters had scoured out vast areas of the American northwest near the end of the last ice age. Mainstream scientists scorned his theory while he searched patiently for answers to what could have triggered such an inconceivably violent event. Finally, an ingenious solution silenced the skeptics: traces of an enormous ice dam half a mile high, which had blocked a valley in present-day Montana and created an enormous lake behind it. With the help of stunningly realistic animation, NOVA takes viewers back to the Ice Age to reveal what happened when the dam broke, unleashing a titanic flood that swept herds of woolly mammoth and everything else into oblivion.Special DVD features include: materials and activities for educators; a link to the NOVA Web site; scene selections; closed captions; and described video for the visually impaired.

{"description": "The first half ofBattlestar Galactica's second season left no doubts about the continuing excellence of the best science fiction TV series of 2005. Beginning with the Colonial Fleet separated, Col. Tigh (Michael Hogan) botching his temporary command, and Capt. Adama (Edward James Olmos) near death after a Cylon assassination attempt, series producer/developer Ronald D. Moore and his gifted writing staff packed more into these 10 episodes than most series manage in a full season. Maintaining its reputation as an adult drama, the series is compellingly anchored by the gravitas of Olmos and Mary McDonnell, whose role as Fleet President Laura Roslin grows more complex as she reveals her diagnosis of breast cancer and defies Adama, playing the \"religious card\" with her conviction that prophetic visions will lead the embattled fleet toward its legendary home planet Earth. As Adama's son Apollo (Jamie Bamber) wrestles with his role in Roslin's mutinous agenda, paranoia runs high as Cylon copies (or \"avatars\") of Boomer (Grace Park) complicate matters aboard Galactica and on Kobol, where a lost Raptor crew struggles to survive and Dr. Baltar (James Callis) endures the increasingly haunting and manipulative intrusions into his tormented psyche by Number Six (Tricia Helfer), the seductive Cylon who holds the secret to the Cylon master plan to destroy humankind.Further action takes place on Cylon-occupied Caprica, where Starbuck (Katee Sackhoff) and Helo (Tamoh Penikett) discover a group of human resistance fighters who survived the Cylons' nuclear attack in season 1. As all of these plot threads are expertly interwoven, the high-stakes conflict ofBG 2.0culminates in a suspenseful mid-season cliffhanger. Through all of this,Battlestar Galacticamaintains consistently high standards of intelligent drama and well-justified, story-based use of spectacular special effects, while developing rich relationships across a broad spectrum of interesting supporting characters. The series' large and likable cast is well-used throughout (even smaller roles are given adequate dimension), and Moore's \"podcast\" commentaries provide a smart, thorough analysis of the show's writing process and conceptual evolution. Yes, it's undeniably true that this half-season DVD set is a blatantly commercial ploy to lure more and more viewers into the ongoing season (which resumed in January 2006), but you can hardly blame Universal for capitalizing on a high-quality series.

{"description": "Blockbuster action director Michael Bay delivers a striking look at a strange world of the future in this sci-fi action drama. Midway through the 21st century, Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) lives in a confined indoor community after ongoing abuse of the Earth has rendered most of the planet uninhabitable. One of the only places in the outside world still capable of sustaining life is an idyllic island where citizens are chosen to live through a lottery. Or at least that's what Lincoln and his fellow citizens are taught to believe; the truth is that Lincoln, like everyone he knows, is actually a clone who is kept under wraps to provide needed organs when the person who supplied his or her DNA falls ill. When he becomes aware that his existence is a fraud, Lincoln escapes to the outside world with a fellow clone, Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson), though the powers that be are determined to see that no one gets away alive.The Islandalso stars Steve Buscemi, Djimon Hounsou, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Sean Bean.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767805712", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B0069UP2PI", "B00005JL78", "B0013PSTMC", "B004LWZW7E", "B004XQO90O", "B008JFUO36", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B00AEFXCLU", "B001GCUO02", "B0001NBNDY", "B002GIBVVG", "B00KHWSB5M", "B0018O4YT0", "B00005JLWN", "B0001CNRAM", "B002ZG98SW", "B00005JN0T", "B00K7IPFSM", "B00JPFTX5O", "B0009YA3OA", "B001CC7PLM", "B000AP04FG", "B005LAIIMG", "B005LAII8A", "B0013LL2Z2", "B002ZG980U", "B008JFUN50", "B00005JMWP", "B000EQHXNW", "B004WCTLNY", "B004EPYZOO", "B001GKJ2E8", "B007R6DJP8", "B00AEFXSLE", "B00AKGG8I2", "B000EZ908Y", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00BEIYIF0", "B0045HCJ8A", "B004LWZW4M", "B000BVM1S2", "B0067EKYAY", "B00AEBB8NI", "B001FB55HQ", "B00005JPAR", "B004LWZW42", "B001VLBDD0", "B0062P3392", "B000FS9FCG", "B008JFUPFI", "B00IKM5MIA", "B004A8ZX28", "B000056PMU", "B00005JPD0", "B005COLETU", "B003Q6D2B4", "B004EPYZSK", "B000P0J0EW", "B009AMAJPA", "B002SG7Z7A", "B00H83EUQW", "B000LC55F2", "B00DWZHTOU", "B005NKIPUY", "B005LAIHPE", "B000A2IPQY", "B00AEBB89W", "B0051MKNV8", "B005LAIIPS", "B001EAWMGA", "B00A7MSQRK", "6304711891", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B002GHHHOC", "B0021L8V0M", "B000P0I4O4", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AS1Q93S", "B00004XPPG", "B0045HCJFS", "B003UYUQZW", "B001OQCVI8", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00096S49Y", "B005LAIGRS", "B000EGDB10", "B002ZG984Q", "B000FGGE68", "B003L20IG0", "B0036TGSR6", "B0045HCJGC", "B002DU39GW", "B0002KVUKM", "B008JFUQZ2", "B000H30B2C", "0767803434", "B00AEBB8QK"], "bought_together": ["0767805712", "B0069UP2PI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004WCTLNY", "B004XQO90O", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B004SBQAN8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 95555}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.44, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B000BO0LH2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5133H8SZ04L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Island"}

{"description": "You know you're back in Bergman country when a character begins speaking to the camera right from the start. In the prologue toSaraband, which was made for Swedish television, Marianne (Liv Ullmann) recounts the changes that have taken place sinceScenes From a Marriage, the miniseries-turned-feature that introduced the central couple. Johan (Erland Josephson) has retired from academia, while she continues to practice family law. Since splitting up for good, they haven't seen each other in over 30 years. Marianne decides it's time to reconnect and makes plans to visit Johan at his remote cottage. While they catch up, she gets to know his estranged son, Henrik (B&#xF6;rje Ahlstedt), and beloved granddaughter, Karin (Julia Dufvenius), who are staying in the guest house. Both are still reeling from the death of Henrik's wife, Anna, two years ago. Although she never appears--she's represented by a portrait of Bergman's late wife, Ingrid, to whom the film is dedicated--Anna's ghost haunts them all (even Marianne, who never knew her). Divided into 10 parts plus the prologue and epilogue,Sarabandlooks more like a play than a film, which is not necessarily a drawback (it's in keeping with the \"scenes\" of the original series). The focus is on the characters and their words. They could be anywhere at any time; their problems are personal yet universal. For two hours, the outside world does not exist. In the complete universe Bergman has created for them, it doesn't need to.

{"description": "Three world-class directors put their auteurist stamps on this anthology of films dealing with sex, desire, and obsession. First, and best, is \"The Hand,\" Wong Kar-Wai's ravishing drama set in 1960s Hong Kong. Chang Chen stars as an apprentice tailor who becomes enthrall to an imperious, tragically downwardly mobile courtesan (Gong Li). During their first meeting, she takes a hands-on interest in his sexual initiation, explaining that the memory will inspire him to make beautiful clothes for her. Steven Soderbergh lightens the mood with \"Equilibrium,\" starring Robert Downey Jr. as a very anxious 1950s adman relating a curious dream to a very distracted psychiatrist (the always wonderful Alan Arkin). Last, and sadly, least, is Michelangeolo Antonioni's \"The Dangerous Thread of Things\" about an estranged couple, a tryst, and dancing nude on the beach. A world away from such towering masterworks asL'Aventura, it's elusive and pretentious, almost like anSCTVparody of 1960s foreign films. But here, for the more prurient viewers, is the earthy, gratuitious nudity and frolicking sex for which one might desire in a movie titledEros.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00LT1JHLW", "B000BRBA8S", "B0010SAGHS", "B000E33W0I", "B008MPQ0R2", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B0002X7GWU", "B004YCKJNI", "B000A1OFZA", "B001O7SWHG", "B000EU1ONS", "B0016MJ6HY", "B000NO1XG8", "B000GBEWPC", "B00HVOFP6W", "B00061I29E", "B00K0MM4AM", "B00003CXUM", "B00003JRAV", "B004KVXC64", "B00GPPXNLC", "B004SEUJEG", "B00005M1ZQ", "B00BNWWUDY", "B00064AFK0", "B00AOO5PXO", "B005BJ7XL4", "B008220DIC", "B00005BHW6", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B00ET2ODX0", "B004H0M2WI", "B004SUDQC2", "B00006LPER", "B00BJSLNN0", "B001BPB5YI", "B0000694XY", "B00IKM5OYW", "B00GB0OVV2", "B0027BOL46", "B00HE011DE", "B00HGBAG5K", "B0071HPP1Y", "B001DE29SS", "B003C9VEVK", "B000QXDCLA", "B000092T3H", "B000YV1Q30", "B00IGK6TH4", "B00GPPXP6A", "B0009GX1XI", "B0000A1HR4", "B0041LULL2", "B00JPQ1I7O", "B005D0RDWK", "B001TK80CA", "B00E1HIWXU", "B000NVT0SO", "B000065V3B", "B002P7UCJK", "B00DZP1C3Q", "B000JGWD50", "B00ATK015K", "B00F98FOFY", "B001PYD0KW", "B006GVNHUM", "B00004W21Z", "B000FZEU0G", "B000F3UA6Q", "B00023P4I8", "B00BSN0VZ2", "B001EKGQX0", "B00005JMIJ", "B000C3L2P2", "B00003CXDJ", "B000PKG8TM", "B000E1NXJ0", "B00022S7EC", "B003ZJ9572", "B00004W229", "6304884370", "B00000F7E6", "B006MGWBWQ", "B00GBT62PQ", "B0031REQAO", "B001CW7ZT4", "6305460183", "B00005JL57", "B00B2BYXSG", "B00782O7LG", "B001O2UTRC", "B000OY8NBK", "B002ZG9940", "B009AVC936", "B00005Y6XB", "B002P7UCBI", "B00097DY2A", "B002M9WW5I", "B0000687DE", "B0064MT1NU"], "bought_together": ["B000BRBA8S", "B0010SAGHS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000NO1XG8", "B000E33W0I", "B00AOO5PXO", "B001O7SWHG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 202745}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.07, "brand": "Warner Bros", "asin": "B000C3L26Q", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VXWFV7YCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Eros"}

After a calamitous falling out, the two sisters travel a bumpy road toward true appreciation for one another--aided along the way by the discovery of the maternal grandmother they thought was dead.

{"description": "Like a dream,Howl's Moving Castlecarries audiences to vistas beyond their imaginations where they experience excitement, adventure, terror, humor, and romance. With domestic box office receipts of over $210 million,Howlpassed Miyazaki'sPrincess Mononoketo become the #3 film in Japanese history, behind hisSpirited Awayand James Cameron'sTitanic. Based on a juvenile novel by Diana Wynne Jones,Howl's Moving Castlemarks the first time Miyazaki has adapted another writer's work sinceKiki's Delivery Service(1989). Sophie, a 19-year-old girl who believes she is plain, has resigned herself to a drab life in her family's hat shop--until the Witch of the Waste transforms her into a 90-year-old woman. In her aged guise, Sophie searches for a way to break the Witch's spell and finds unexpected adventures. Like Chihiro, the heroine ofSpirited Away, Sophie discovers her hidden potential in a magical environment--the castle of the title. Using CG, Miyazaki creates a ramshackle structure that looks like it might disintegrate at any moment. Sophie's honesty and determination win her some valuable new friends: Markl, Howl's young apprentice; a jaunty scarecrow; Calcifer, a temperamental fire demon; and Heen, a hilarious, wheezing dog. She wins the heart of the dashing, irresponsible wizard Howl, and brings an end an unnecessary and destructive war. The film overflows with eclipsing visuals that range from frightening aerial battles to serene landscapes, and few recent features--animated or live action--offer as much magic asHowl's Moving Castle.--Charles SolomonThe Many Worlds of Hayao MiyazakiThe works of MiyazakiThe BookThe Art of Howls' Moving Castle(book)Stills fromHowl's Moving Castle(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JLEU", "B00003CXBK", "B002ZTQV8Y", "B002ZTQVHK", "B002ZTQVLG", "B0001XAPZ6", "B002ZTQVGQ", "B005LAIGX2", "B0006J28BO", "B00CSYR432", "B006LLY8LY", "B000CDGVOO", "B0001XAPY2", "0061478784", "B004CRR9EW", "B00ENNO1E6", "B004CRR9G0", "B0009MAO3W", "B00CSYRHG6", "B00B1RB942", "B002ZTQVBQ", "B005LAIGXM", "B00ENNUC9Y", "B00CJ7Y0US", "B007JNTPSO", "B001XUTVLK", "0061477974", "B0009P42S2", "B0023S49YU", "B008XEZXYI", "B008XEZXRA", "6304493681", "B004KL0OW4", "B004916TPG", "B002APNJC4", "B00BEYYEJ4", "B007D5R4GI", "B001QU9RSY", "B007JNTOBC", "B001VBM0Z0", "1421541181", "B002PTBSE6", "B001AXU1DC", "B0054JELWU", "1421566028", "B007V973TO", "B0001IN0MQ", "0316369020", "1569317771", "B00F8PTBLQ", "B009LDCUP0", "B000UPMZ1C", "B000M2E33G", "B00GSPKRN6", "B00005NB94", "1421500493", "B008YRL7JE", "B000FZETRU", "0061478776", "B00CEJIT0S", "B007BMIFL6", "B005NQ5LLY", "B00005RDSQ", "B005W2BWQW", "B0034G4OZE", "B003VQO4W0", "B003SPDSA8", "B0036TGSW6", "B004EC5IUW", "B004EC5IV6", "B0030ZOYHC", "B00576U9EO", "B0055HK792", "B00BQ1DDUG", "B00CU6WC94", "B002ZG97YM", "B007BMIGQ0", "B00CU6WBOU", "B000AAF1U4", "B00005JLR2", "B00JYKNVBW", "B000CEXFZG", "B0018RKEGY", "B001AI7766", "B000OLGCFW", "B001C4ZQEI", "B000LSAIZ8", "B005NQ5LOQ", "B00005JKZV", "B005HVWW6C", "B000FZETI4", "B0049TC8C6", "B008YRL7JO", "B004W75BQU", "B00005JN4W", "B00GWWADDY"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLEU", "B00003CXBK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CXBK", "B002ZTQV8Y", "B00005JLEU", "B002ZTQVHK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1870}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 22.99, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B000CDGVOE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ROjdVz1uL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Howl's Moving Castle"}

{"description": "Nobody does comic existential angst like Nicolas Cage, who gets a good workout inThe Weather Man, an underrated slice of quiet desperation. Cage plays David Spritz, a Chicago TV meteorologist who knows only too well the constant uncertainty of predicting the weather. Despite a possible offer from a network morning show, David's life is a mess:  he's estranged from his kids and irritated wife (Hope Davis), he's perpetually at odds with his remote father (Michael Caine), and lately people on the street have had the disconcerting habit of throwing food at him. Director Gore Verbinski (Pirates of the Caribbean) has perhaps too heavy a touch for this kind of comic melancholy, but screenwriter Steven Conrad has an interesting, almost Mamet-like ear for \"written\" dialogue--Cage has a few voiceover monologues, including an uproarious sequence involving tartar sauce and a walk to the store, that are hugely funny. It's possible that we've seen Cage in this kind of character one too many times, but he's still good at it, and his doleful face and pasted-on smile fit the mood of the picture. Unlike the heroes of most Hollywood movies, David Spritz doesn't always--or often--do the right thing, but Cage makes you want to see the poor sap make it.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00012QLB4", "B005F2JRUC", "B00005JLRE", "B000JYW5DW", "B000BBOUW2", "B001J710Z2", "B000PMFRZQ", "B000GRUMRS", "B000CNESJO", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B00E8G5HNM", "B000BYA5G4", "B000059TG6", "B004EPYZOO", "B00003CXXG", "B000IFRT5Q", "B001GCUO02", "B00BTYMPX6", "0767810856", "6304806434", "B00006LPGP", "B002TVQ48A", "B002TVQ48K", "B001MLZNLW", "B00441GZ00", "B00000G02H", "B00008L3UF", "0792838068", "B00AEBB8JM", "B00BJB2GZG", "B004XFZ4JK", "B00062IDGK", "B000OVLBF8", "B007IUEEA2", "B000B8I9Y0", "B002GHHHKG", "B00IKM5OYW", "0792844831", "B000NA1WDQ", "076780676X", "B001JIE7JC", "B00005JLSB", "B0007P0X9G", "B00007AJF8", "B00C6F61HS", "6304711891", "B00005JL7Q", "B00005JK8K", "B00005JN5E", "B00004Z4WR", "B004SIP95G", "B00003CXPV", "B00003L9CH", "B00000JGHL", "B00275EHBY", "B00003CWTI", "B0071HPOV0", "B0015OKWKS", "B002VECMAE", "B00HUCF6KK", "B0039UT3LK", "6301971345", "B000EHRVOW", "B00AEFYAC0", "B000H0MKOC", "B005DCJ2DG", "B00007J5VQ", "B002ZG99KO", "B003102JDM", "B0009R1TI6", "B002CPMB9O", "B00BB67UNW", "B000FDEVA2", "B000CBCWRG", "B000066TGP", "B0013D8LC2", "B00020HAX8", "B00005JLO8", "B00005JLFA", "B001P3SA8K", "B002ZG980U", "B0045HCJFS", "B006TTC5MM", "B000DZIGDU", "B000H6SXSI", "B00AEBB9CS", "B000EDWKXI", "B000NIVJF4", "B00062IVM6", "B00009K011", "B0015OKWKI", "B009L79YFU", "B00005JMJG", "B0002W4UDE", "B000286RNE", "B002ZG983M", "B000UJ48SQ", "B000MEYFY6", "B00008EY9G", "B00AEBB9WI"], "bought_together": ["B00012QLB4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00012QLB4", "B000JLTRIQ", "B005F2JRUC", "B000JYW5DW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 132923}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.47, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B000CSUNQQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JTWC5Y4HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Weather Man (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "A decade after their last hilarious short, the Oscar-winningA Close Shave, Claymation wonders Wallace and Gromit return for a full-length adventure. Daffy scientist Wallace (voiced by Peter Sallis) and his heroic dog Gromit are doing well with their business, Anti-Pesto, a varmint-hunting outfit designed to keep their English town safe from rabbits chomping on prized vegetables. Wallace meets Lady Tottington (Helena Bonham Carter), who appreciates Wallace's humane way of dealing with rabbits (courtesy of the Bun-Vac 6000), and sets up a rivalry with the gun-toting Victor Quartermaine (Ralph Fiennes, enjoying himself more than ever). Creator Nick Park, with co-director/writer Steve Box, delivers a story worthy of the 85-minute running time, although it stretches the act a bit; the formula plays better shorter, but the literally hand-crafted film is a joy to watch. Taking a chapter from classic horror films, a giant were-rabbit is soon on the prowl, and the town is up in arms, what with the annual vegetable contest close at hand. (Anyone who's seen the previous three shorts knows who saves the day.) Never content to do something simply when the extravagant will do, W&G;'s lives are filled with whimsical Rude Goldberg-style devices, and the opening number showcasing their alarm system is pure Aardman Animation at its finest. Even though there's a new twist here--a few mild sight gags aimed at adults--this G-rated film will delight young and old alike as Park, like team Pixar, seems incapable of making anything but an outstanding film.--Doug ThomasSee more clay animation and Wallace &amp; Gromit titles...Director Nick Park on DVDStop-Motion &amp; Clay Animation TitlesWallace &amp; GromitStuff Galore", "related": {"also_bought": ["B006W4KVI4", "B002DPVI0Q", "B001LXIDTK", "B00003CXJ4", "B001LXIDTA", "B001LXIDT0", "B002DR2GJQ", "B000M343BC", "B000W089WO", "B001OC6RZA", "B001F0TT8I", "B004AGN9MG", "B000AA4JNE", "B002ZG4QDE", "B000A2UBOI", "B003BJODIC", "B004KV93AI", "B00005JNQS", "B000H7JCK0", "B0072GOJ48", "B006W4KRRY", "B002WJI2QQ", "B0012EM5D8", "B002D755B2", "B0006JMLRK", "B0000640SC", "B004ZQJ5FQ", "B001DPHDCY", "0783231474", "6305161887", "B000MV9026", "B0034G4P26", "B001ECQ75A", "B0045I3EQA", "B000BITUVG", "B005FNLUFQ", "B000ION23A", "B007Z2DO0E", "B003XEKXWK", "B004HO6I4M", "B001GCUO7A", "B003TJM60G", "B000AY74OG", "B003E66Y84", "B00000JL8E", "B00005JMQZ", "B00009M9BK", "B000DWMYQ8", "B00003CXG7", "B0000AK7AB", "B00029LO0Y", "B0001906W2", "B0006UEVT0", "B00CWM58WY", "B000RMJ4F8", "B002ZG97YM", "B0019BI11E", "B0052MXJ3Q", "B0034G4P1W", "B000MNOX9E", "B004EPZ034", "B00DBVHHDS", "B00I6JOD2S", "B005LAIHW2", "B000IFRT2O", "B005F96UJ6", "1782760326", "B0039N74CW", "B0045ZAQS2", "B000BB1MI2", "B000UVKGPI", "B0030ZIZRC", "B000C3L27U", "B001PR0YEE", "B003UAKE9Y", "B005SDUV4E", "B001HN6918", "B003RHZ6IE", "B001FTIJS0", "B0013FSL3E", "B00CO9N6CY", "B000VBJEEG", "B00009YXAW", "B0015XWUAY", "B00AEFYXD6", "B00007LVCM", "B0034GK74G", "B0042U94UQ", "B00CHVJODE", "B00008G8LM", "B00A8KJK7G", "B000G75AZC", "B00005JN4W", "B000ROAK2W", "B005LAII62", "B00E00OGE2", "B007J3ISKK", "6305123454"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXJ4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0044RFTBA", "B002DPVI0Q", "B00I0VTOMG", "B001LXIDTA"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5628}, "asin": "B000CZ0PT4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61MzjQMqG%2BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Rent, the show that in 1996 gave voice to a Broadway generation, has finally become an energetic, passionate, and touching movie musical. Based loosely on Puccini'sLa Boh&#xE8;me, it focuses on the year in the life of a group of friends in New York's East Village--\"bohemians\" who live carefree lives of art, music, sex, and drugs. Well, carefree until Mark, an aspiring filmmaker (Anthony Rapp), and Roger, an aspiring songwriter (Adam Pascal), find out they owe a year's rent to Benny (Taye Diggs), a former friend who had promised them free residence when he married the landlord's daughter. Roger has also attracted the attention of his downstairs neighbor, Mimi (Rosario Dawson), while Mark's former girlfriend, Maureen (Idina Menzel), has found a new romance in a lawyer named Joanne (Tracie Thoms). Philosophy professor Tom (Jesse L. Martin) finds his soul mate in drag queen Angel (Wilson Jermaine Heredia). But because this is the late-'80s, the threat of AIDS is always present.The remarkable thing aboutRentthe movie is that nearly 10 years after the show debuted onBroadway, six of the eight principals return in the roles they originated. They're a bit older than would be ideal for their characters, but they do have the advantage of having learned the show directly from creator Jonathan Larson (who died of an aortic aneurysm while the show was in previews), plus they started young--we're not exactly talking Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford here.  Alongside a polished performance like Rapp's--sometimes observer-commentator, sometimes participant in two of the score's showstoppers, \"The Tango Maureen\" and \"La Vie Boheme\"--the two new additions (Thoms in place of Fredi Walker, Dawson in place of the edgier Daphne Rubin-Vega) slip comfortably into the ensemble; the pivotal Dawson makes a seductive case as Mimi when she tempts Roger in the mesmerizing \"Light My Candle\" or burns up the stage of the Catscratch Club in \"Out Tonight.\"  Moviegoers who have an aversion to people who break into song while walking down the street probably won't have their minds changed byRent(even if they are singingrocksongs), and the gritty subject matter and lack of big-name stars make it unlikely to cross over to general audiences the wayChicagodid.  But fans of musicals should find \"Seasons of Love\" as stirring as ever, and the show's passionate admirers--the \"Rentheads\"--probably couldn't have wished for a more sympathetic director thanRentfan Chris Columbus, or a more faithful representation of the show they love.--David HoriuchiOn the DVDThree powerful musical numbers cut from the final film are the highlight of the two-disc DVD.  In the aftermath of the funeral scene, Anthony Rapp sings \"Halloween,\" and he, Adam Pascal, and Rosario Dawson share \"Goodbye Love\" (both songs were in the stage version). Then in an alternate ending, the cast finishes \"No Day But Today\" on the bare stage on which the film began.  There are worthwhile arguments for why these scenes were cut or replaced, so it's fortunate that the DVD lets us see these at all.  Those musical numbers have optional commentary by director Chris Columbus, Rapp, and Pascal (two other cut scenes have no commentary), including one funny moment in which Rapp explains in great detail the technical challenge of shooting \"Halloween\" only to have Columbus say, \"Yeah, but I don't know if that's the take we used.\"  The three also provide commentary on the film itself, with Columbus discussing various decisions, criticizing the critics, and marveling \"I still don't know how we got the PG-13,\" and Rapp and Pascal occasionally recalling differences in the stage version.The other whopper of a feature isNo Day But Today, a nearly two-hour documentary that uses video clips, still photographs, and interviews with family and friends to celebrate the short life of Jonathan Larson and his creation.  Topics include his early interest in musical theater (\"I want to write theHairfor the '90s.\"), the support of Stephen Sondheim, the impact of the AIDS epidemic, the long and difficult road ofRent(casting the show, Larson learning to collaborate, the transfer to a Broadway stage, and the Rentheads), and Larson's tragic death. The last 20 minutes covers the making of the film, director Chris Columbus, the decision to rely on most of the original cast (the only two principals who didn't appear in the movie, Daphne Rubin-Vega and Fredi Walker-Browne, are interviewed in earlier segments, but only mentioned in passing here), recording sessions, and location shooting.  If the movie ofRentwas a tribute to Jonathan Larson, the DVD is all that and more, a moving and incredibly detailed look at an extraordinary talent whom the world lost far too soon.--David HoriuchiMoreRentMovie soundtrackOriginal Broadway cast recordingAnthony Rapp'sWithout You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical \"Rent\"", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001LMAKAG", "B000AYEI4U", "B006ZZQMXS", "B000005ALT", "B004SEUJBE", "B0007TKNII", "B000077VR3", "B002D0L0R2", "0688154379", "B00AEBBAEK", "B000Z8R2VW", "B002G1K82Q", "B00GM7ZFAA", "B00JAOW3MA", "B00006D295", "B005S9EK5Y", "B0028SVXVM", "B00004XMTJ", "B001MT7ZEW", "B001GKJ2DY", "B006Z21ZFG", "6304806418", "0743269772", "B0000AM6IY", "B0000TB01Y", "B00070HK24", "B002NZK5TG", "B002ZG976U", "B00AEFY5TI", "B000EWBKMG", "B00008973A", "1423406265", "B00AEFXTKO", "B0013Z7RUC", "B00004W5VC", "B00GTO6WXU", "B000I2J6YG", "B000RPCK2E", "0800141806", "0743269764", "B00028HBIO", "0783240287", "B0007WFXZI", "0792841638", "B005QIOKBQ", "1938438175", "B005SFR7YE", "B003L77GAQ", "B001FB55OE", "B000E3LHSM", "B00001PE59", "0767827929", "B000J3OTSM", "B000UAE7NG", "B005LAIHR2", "B009NYF2GQ", "B00005JOFQ", "B002ZG99IG", "B0000VCZKM", "B00005O3VD", "B001HN69AY", "B000FIHN5M", "B0011U52E2", "B0000524E5", "B003H6Z0PO", "B006WZIB1C", "B004D9FLJE", "0061350966", "B0053O8A5K", "B001CTA1UM", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00133KFGW", "B000URDCC6", "B001LMAKAQ", "B0009JE57G", "B009LDD5E0", "B00003CYJ4", "B00001PE4D", "B005PTMPYA", "B00005OCMS", "B004VJJFDE", "B00003CXHG", "B00447L4KA", "B0002E5O9G", "B0009IOR6Q", "B001FAFO3W", "B005BUA1HQ", "B00C81AVNU", "B00004RF9K", "B00166UFSY", "B002D0L0QS", "B00AMEZDJW", "B00006RIO7", "B00FGEO7OK", "B000683VI4", "B001JV5BF8", "B00005UQ9W", "B00GB0ORJ8"], "bought_together": ["B001LMAKAG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001LMAKAG", "B000077VR3", "B004SEUIWO", "B005SFR7YE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7679}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.86, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000E1YVZU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61ZTKXS4AGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rent (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)"}

{"description": "There was a time when the defense attorney was a heroic everyman, not the butt of bad jokes; think Atticus Finch inTo Kill a Mockingbird, and, of course, Raymond Burr's incomparable Perry Mason. The first season ofPerry Mason, which launched in 1957 on CBS, shows just how dramatic a \"law and order\" show could be. Shot in lush black and white, on film, the episodes have been lovingly restored (including lost minutes hacked from reruns to accommodate commercials). The story arcs and atmosphere feel more like film noir (Perry Mason + Philip Marlowe = separated at birth?) than early TV. The cast was stellar, including Burr's Emmy-winning Perry Mason, the indefatigable lawyer who takes tough cases no one else will touch. Burr's chemistry crackles from episode 1 with his costars, including Barbara Hale as secretary Della, William Hopper as private detective Paul Drake, and William Talman as Hamilton Burger, the well-meaning but overmatched district attorney. While it's true that the last-minute witness-stand confessions strain some credulity, the case-cracking, character development, and dialogue set a high bar for the legal shows that followed. \"The Case of the Negligent Nymph,\" for instance, involves a comely young woman--and murder suspect--fished out of the Pacific; Mason deadpans to Drake, \"Call off the search, Paul; we've landed our mermaid.\" The shows unfold at a leisurely pace, and yet don't rely on the overly expositive dialogue that, say,Law & Orderdoes; the viewer learns a lot about each case simply as it happens. The set contains the first 19 episodes of the first season and will hook you, even if you're not a procedural buff.--A.T.

{"description": "A movie that exudes affection and goodwill,The World's Fastest Indianis an unabashed mash note to a lovely character from New Zealand's recent past. Burt Munro, played by Anthony Hopkins, is a cantankerous Kiwi with an obsession:  he's been tinkering with his 1920s-era Indian brand motorcycle for years, pushing it to ever-faster speeds. It's the 1960s, and Burt has the utterly mad idea of taking the bike to the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, site of world records for speed racing. The movie takes a while to get to the journey--and then the journey takes a while--but the genial atmosphere prevails. (People of a certain age, for whom the word \"Bonneville\" evokes pleasant associations with hotrods and world-speed records, will not be disappointed in the film's location shooting, or its sense of awe.) Hopkins is not quite on-the-money casting for the jovial, happy-go-lucky Munro, and his accent wavers, but he nails the emotional scenes and the fascination with speed. Smaller bits are well-filled by Diane Ladd and Christopher Lawford (son of Peter), who looks uncannily of the era. New Zealand director Roger Donaldson doesn't take any chances here, but the story clearly means something to him, and that sense of commitment carries the film through its sleepier moments.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B007SUW27E", "B0000YTP02", "B00004Y62V", "B00000JXVK", "B009R68HIA", "B000S88JT8", "B000022TSY", "B00GHYIQ18", "B0039UU3KA", "B007XF0X52", "B001CDFY50", "B000C3L2PC", "B000QFCD7W", "B0006HBZXS", "B0006FYOTC", "B004GSVX9O", "B001LM64S8", "B00005ONLF", "B0009XT8C4", "B00407PNY2", "B00BEIYP1W", "B00E3ZDTWO", "B0000542CH", "B0001GOH6Q", "B007TBJUVI", "B00I3HFB7E", "B0024FAG6M", "6305989435", "B00000IQW5", "B000OHZJIM", "B000CNFC76", "B001VC99HQ", "B000YAF4MA", "B0001NBLX6", "B00I3HFAIE", "B0003JAO5Y", "B0008ENHUI", "B0002HRKVS", "B000085EFG", "B001KXZGO6", "B00066FBQG", "B00AEFXN9G", "B00AEFY7NM", "B003VRJ89S", "B00002SSKG", "B000LPS34E", "B004SIP7ZS", "B003ASLJO0", "B005LAIGRS", "B003UESJME", "B005CMSDLE", "B008JFURII", "B00GNZLWD0", "B002VWNIBI", "B00D3LA5WG", "B004GJYRI2", "B00AEFYVMO", "B0009NSCS0", "B00AEBBA36", "B0042JIL2E", "B004QBWU02", "B00003CXMY", "B00AZNEW5G", "B00C6QYMJG", "B00AHTYI5M", "6305213283", "B00936A0RU", "B0000B1OFL", "B005EVY8MQ", "6305133468", "B002NZK5UK", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00HZMZ218", "B000A7DVR2", "B00AEFY4IA", "B002M2Z3BA", "B002AS464Q", "B00AG4714S", "B00AEBB932", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00006ADD5", "B00006FDCT", "B000MQC9H4", "B00AEBB86A", "B00AKGG6S4", "B000096IAC", "B00IF0KAYS", "B00005JMCN", "B00DDT0JB0", "B000P0J0EW", "B0018PH3L0", "B00AEBB8YW", "B004DK5CW4", "630560097X", "B00005LOL0", "B00E8G5HZ0", "B003L20IG0", "B000G6BLWE", "B000AP04L0"], "bought_together": ["B0000YTP02"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000YTP02", "B00004Y62V"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5731}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.2, "brand": "MAGNOLIA HOME ENTERTAINMENT", "asin": "B000F8DBDK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QVB6EB2PL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The World's Fastest Indian"}

{"description": "In need of some good old-fashioned gore? You'll find it by the bucketload in the low-budget monsterfestFeast, which arrives on DVD in an even bloodier unrated edition. The winning entry in the third season of Ben Affleck and Matt Damon's reality series/talent contestProject Greenlight(Wes Craven is also on board as an advisor/producer),Feastis a wall-to-wall splatterthon that operates on an agreeably simple premise: A crew of motley characters is trapped in a remote location (in this case, a desert bar) by ravenous, flesh-eating monsters (here, a quartet of toothy and astoundingly fecund humanoids). The result? Lots of gruesome deaths and plenty of manic action, delivered with kinetic style by first-time feature director John Gulager. Not everything aboutFeastworks--Gulager's drive is thwarted by the unfocused script, which favors smarmy dialogue over substance--but the effects are impressive, given the film's price tag, and the cast is incredibly game for the gory goings-on, with Krista Allen (Entourage), Judah Friedlander (30 Rock), Balthazar Getty (Alias), and Gulager's father, veteran actor Clu Gulager, among the stand-outs. The DVD includes a smattering of outtakes and deleted scenes (including an alternate ending); commentary by Gulager, the screenwriters, and two of the film's numerous producers; and a making-of featurette, whichProject Greenlightviewers should find interesting solely for producers Chris Moore and Michael Leahy's attitudes towards Gulager (both were a hair's breath away from firing him throughout the production, but here, amusingly suggest unconditional support).-- Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001CDFY64", "B001KKU9CS", "B001J4E19C", "B0004Z31OS", "B000ARFPMQ", "B001T46TAQ", "B000GYI3B8", "B000RW5BZ0", "B00CERJI5U", "B002LMSWN2", "B000NVT0TI", "B000TJ6PB0", "B0002VYOVS", "B008CYDD7I", "B001MFNB4O", "B001MEJY8W", "B002ZG97CO", "B001221DUQ", "B005B0QYMM", "B0028DRGDQ", "B000GI3KGC", "B000MM0LIM", "B000WC38EQ", "B000OYCMLM", "B008G33PIM", "B000UAE7O0", "B00006AUIG", "B000WC389G", "B000069I05", "B0010X73ZG", "B000I0RNZ2", "B00I9TDMRM", "B000G1ALDY", "B004USUP58", "B00DMUFXOS", "B0013D8LLS", "B000068IEV", "B0014VPFVS", "B001D5C1OO", "B0002C9DK4", "B0009X75J2", "B00111YM5Q", "B004BLTNM0", "B00G5GNYY2", "B00C2R122Y", "B000IHY9TS", "B004EI2NP4", "B0006HBZYC", "B000R7HY0K", "B008WAM2E2", "B00005JMA8", "B00009OWI1", "B00003CWRF", "B0037E8HNI", "B0067QPVJ6", "B002QW7ALM", "B0031U8OEK", "B002EOVXBK", "B000AXWHSA", "B000Q66Q56", "B002ZG98N2", "B003L20IEW", "B0000VCZNE", "B0007WQHI0", "6305090564", "B004P7CN3G", "B000IMUYJM", "B00B04NJI0", "B00005JMDZ", "B0000E2R6P", "B000PMLJMQ", "B004EPYZOO", "B00005RHGK", "B008DVJOQ4", "B002YI9304", "B003T6LHWC", "0783227434", "B001MVYUR0", "B005GT3X68", "B000E8M0P6", "B001D2WU9I", "B00A1AU74I", "B00009MEC4", "B000099T3M", "B00DPUB5EW", "B008JFUNYG", "B00IJS2OR2", "B00125WATQ", "B002FICQFM", "B005QUQRBU", "B002JT69IW", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B00009W0U4", "B00196UTEG", "B000BUNZY2", "B00000K3TO", "B001QB9H1U", "B00DRQETEW", "B000K7UBSO", "B008OR5X4O"], "bought_together": ["B001CDFY64", "B001KKU9CS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003VMFWXO", "B001J4E19C", "B004AC6PV2", "B000GYI3B8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 97129}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.85, "brand": "Weinstein Company", "asin": "B000GLL1U6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J881B54AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Feast (Unrated Edition)"}
{"description": "William H. Macy, a longtime collaborator of David Mamet, takes on one of Mamet's biggest, ugliest creations in the title role ofEdmond. Edmond drops out of his ordinary life after a chance encounter with a fortune-teller, and cruises through a New York inferno that leads to murder. It also leads to a great deal of the clipped, counter-punching dialogue that Mamet is famous for, although at times the film plays like a monologue interrupted by peripheral blips on Edmond's skewed radar. Mamet's subject is the frenzied reaction of the modern male to the narrowing of his domain, a crisis that drives Edmond to the familiar touchstones of bar, peep show, and whorehouse, none of which provide the solace he thinks they should. The 2005 film is based on Mamet's 1982 play, and somehow the picture might have had more pop if it had been filmed closer to that time, when panicked masculinity was a fresher subject. And the text is a kind of dark, horrific fable that probably worked better in the stylized realm of the stage than on film. Stuart Gordon directs with a blunt forward motion that foregrounds the most unsavory aspects of the material (fans of hisRe-Animatorshould note the presence of Jeffrey Combs as a snotty hotel clerk). Except for Macy, cast members come and go in the episodic flow, some of them (Joe Mantegna and Rebecca Pidgeon) identified with Mamet's work. Julia Stiles plays the unfortunate waitress who falls into Edmond's path, and Bai Ling, Denise Richards, and Mena Suvari are women of the night who want to charge Edmond too much money.

{"description": "This Jack Black vehicle seems, on the surface, like a perfect fit for the actor: an opportunity to showcase Black's unique style with the extreme facial gestures and exuberant physicality that have become his forte. Black plays Ignacio, a lowly cook in a monastery in central Mexico who feeds orphans by day, and wrestles in the town square at night. Ignacio teams up with Esqueleto (Hector Jimenez), a street urchin who tormented him, to form a tag-team duo that goes up against the strangest wrestlers Mexico has to offer. Besides doing it for money to feed the orphans, Ignacio is also fighting to win the forbidden affections of Sister Encarnacion (Ana de la Reguera) with predictable difficulty. While the movie has likeable characters and the plot is enjoyable enough, it can&#x92;t overcome its plodding pace and formulaic structure enough to keep the movie interesting throughout. Jack Black is a very strong comedic actor, and the wrestling scenes offer plenty of chances for slapstick, physical comedy, but watching him run around in red briefs and blue tights amounts to half the laughs in the movie, and there&#x92;s just not enough here for him to really work with. When he plays a more well-formed character, as inSchool of RockandHigh Fidelity, his strengths really show. But inNacho Librehe&#x92;s saddled with a caricature. Weighed down by too much low-brow humor and a script that goes nowhere,Nacho Librejust can&#x92;t make full enough use of Black&#x92;s talents to overcome the obstacles.--Daniel Vancini", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00H47IXTC", "B003498RCW", "B00AEFYP3E", "B00AEBB87O", "B00AEFY7YQ", "B001IKKMCW", "B001GPOSYC", "B00AEFYYA8", "B00BG4R476", "B00AEBB9C8", "B004IK30S2", "B000WQWPJQ", "B004SJ0EBE", "B005ERX1UU", "B0018O4YSQ", "B005DZ35TU", "B00AEFXXFU", "B00CXYCBNA", "B00AEFYRVO", "B002KLAL8S", "B00193F304", "B00E9E4F68", "B0062VL4XS", "B00AEFXIQE", "B00E3QJ7FG", "B00CXY9WIM", "B00H7KJTCG", "B004ZJZQ1A", "B00DYEN6XC", "B00HWWUQYY", "B007Q1GJA6", "B000MEYFXW", "B00AEBBAEA", "B00AEFXJNQ", "B001G5T6GC", "B00JL6L4WC", "B00H83EV5W", "B00COHGPQA", "B008V5UQZK", "B003IWZ750", "B008JFUR10", "B008MIMWOO", "B00AEBBAF4", "B004TJ1H0A", "B004047XWU", "B006WZIETG", "B005KQVDH8", "B002ZG97WO", "B0014DFCMS", "B00267QOEQ", "B0021L9ME6", "B001O7JHW0", "B001IKKMD6", "B00AEFXDGE", "B0090SI582", "B004RQDPBE", "B0014BQQZM", "B001KZVQJI", "B0082JRF7C", "B001KEHAHQ", "B000J4P9PI", "B0029XFN8A", "B00CTSDDVO", "B001CW7ZUS", "B00COHGORU", "B00HERGM86", "B0093LE2OC", "B0047685I2", "B00BLN4UDI", "B004RQDYXI", "B00DHHWY9I"], "bought_together": ["B00H47IXTC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001JNNDE2", "B0082JRF7C", "B0054OGQOQ", "B005ERX1UU"]}, "price": 19.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 149245}, "asin": "B000HDZK1Y", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51sDOKT8e4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Nacho Libre [Blu-ray]"}

Mary (Jessica Biel) gets her driver's license, Lucy (Beverley Mitchell) gets a boyfriend, Simon (David Gallagher) gets a girlfriend, and Ruthie (Mackenzie Rosman) remains the most precocious member of the Camden household.Since7th Heavenis an issue-oriented show and since the Camden brood are basically good, it's up to their friends and neighbors to generate the bulk of the trouble.

Granted, the Camden kids aren't perfect--Mary does skiponeclass and Matt handles an ex-girlfriend's engagement poorly--but they make most others look like hooligans in comparison.

{"description": "Lo and behold,Clerks IIdefies the odds as a sequel that even the most ardentClerksfans can be happy about. Twelve years after Kevin Smith turned the independent film world upside-down with his $27,000 black-and-white comedy, perpetual slackers Dante (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson) return for another raucous romp in suburbia, but this time there's no beloved Quick Stop mini-mart to ensure their low-level employment. Now they're aimless 33-year-olds flippin' burgers at Mooby's, a fast-food joint with a cow theme that's \"udderly delicious.\" Dante's engaged to his long-time girlfriend but has unexpectedly fallen in love with Mooby's manager Becky (and since she's played by Rosario Dawson, can you blame him?), and Randal's still holding out for life, liberty, and the pursuit of low ambition. The responsibilities of adulthood are rearing their ugly head, and with Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith) still dealing weed and generally being obnoxious, well... something's gotta give, right? The way Smith has written this long-awaited follow-up, the dilemmas of Dante, Randal, and their ongoing friendship are something that anyone can relate to, and with Dawson lighting up the screen (in a role demanded by producer Harvey Weinstein to boost box-office appeal), the movie's romantic chemistry is surprisingly delightful. Rest assured, also, that Smith (shooting mostly in color this time, on a $5 million budget) hasn't forgotten where he came from:Clerks IIis jam-packed with the same lewd, crude humor that madeClerksan indie-film phenomenon, and Smith's good-natured sincerity is still on full display, ensuring that only the most prudish viewers could possibly be offended. For everyone else, this is as enjoyable as any sequel could ever hope to be, with amusing cameos by Smith-movie veterans Ben Affleck and Jason Lee, among others.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SIP6LS", "B00000IQW4", "B004SIP8ES", "B004XVMCH6", "B007D0FUTG", "B00003CWOL", "B004U7MQW4", "B001KKU9DW", "B005FUTBWS", "B0016MJ6GA", "B00007149S", "B000CPH9PM", "B004SIP6N6", "B001CDFY4Q", "B000I0QLOQ", "B000ICL3L0", "B000EMGJAO", "1592406890", "B001OD4S50", "B000JJ4DNW", "B00068WOH8", "B0018BZEOC", "B005G5NPLA", "B0023TCWE8", "B00363WGBO", "B0002V7TMY", "B007D0FVYA", "B00003CXPS", "B000A7DVR2", "B001J9KJ4I", "0783230338", "B000BBOUCC", "B00009MGEM", "B000093FLA", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000031EFY", "B001C0JCBA", "B006WXHJLC", "B00029LO5E", "B001MFNB58", "0783227434", "B002ZG96ZC", "0800141687", "B008220BGQ", "B00007AJGM", "B0050PYNP8", "B00441GYVA", "B000M9CB4W", "1592407447", "B00BEIYH1A", "B00AEFXVW0", "B000WC3864", "B00AEFZ7F4", "B003VPX5Y4", "0767837398", "B005LAII12", "B000BYA5G4", "B009AMALGM", "B000AARKXA", "B00003CXS7", "B000GBEWGQ", "B000AXWHSA", "B004QL7K70", "0783229526", "B00005JN2Z", "B002O3Z4VG", "B00B4VSUBK", "B000WZEZGI", "B000VXWX7E", "B002ZG97XI", "B00BPEJWAE", "B008RNYMG0", "184856497X", "B00860YIJU", "B004SIP8ZM", "B004EPZ084", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00008975Z", "B00005JM23", "B000IZJZIU", "B003Y5H5C4", "B006TTC50Y", "B004SEUJFK", "B00E1HIX66", "B00005JKMN", "B00005JKHP", "B000069CF0", "B00007ELER", "B009DA743Y", "B001G5T6GW", "B00004TJMW", "B0006HBZE2", "B00005JNZU", "B00029RTAI", "B004UXUWEC", "B0018RKEQE", "6305551235", "B007WW94TW"], "bought_together": ["B004SIP6LS", "B00000IQW4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004SIP6LS", "B00000IQW4", "B0016MJ6GA", "B004SIP8ES"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14519}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.25, "brand": "Weinstein Company", "asin": "B000I0RNVQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51tIUlFx1EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Clerks II (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "This clever, funny big-screen adaptation of Lauren Weisberger's best-seller takes some of the snarky bite out of the chick lit book, but smoothes out the characters' boxy edges to make a more satisfying movie. There's no doubtThe Devil Wears Prada belongs to Meryl Streep, who turns in an Oscar&#65533;-worthy (seriously!) strut as the monster editor-in-chief ofRunway, an elite fashion magazine full of size-0, impossibly well-dressed plebes. This makes new second-assistant Andrea (Anne Hathaway), who's smart but an unacceptable size 6, stick out like a sore thumb. Streep has a ball sending her new slave on any whimsical errand, whether it's finding the seventh (unpublished) Harry Potter book or knowing what type she means when she wants \"skirts.\" Though Andrea thumbs her nose at the shallow world of fashion (she's only doing the job to open doors to a position atThe New Yorker someday), she finds herself dually disgusted yet seduced by the perks of the fast life. The film sends a basic message: Make work your priority, and you'll be rich and powerful... and lonely. Any other actress would have turned Miranda into a scenery-chewing Cruella, but Streep's underplayed, brilliant comic timing make her a fascinating, unapologetic character. Adding frills to the movie's fun are Stanley Tucci as Streep's second-in-command, Emily Blunt (My Summer of Love) as the overworked first assistant, Simon Baker as a sexy writer, and breathtaking couture designs any reader ofVogue would salivate over. --Ellen A.

Through interviews with two U.S. Congressmen, former IRS Commissioner and former IRS and FBI agents, tax attorneys and authors, Russo connects the dots between money creation, federal income tax, and the national identity card, which becomes law in May 2008 and will use Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology.

The sixth feature film by Perry chronicles the inner workings of two families&mdash;one upper-crust and the other working class&mdash;that become inextricably linked by scandal.    Wealthy socialite Charlotte Cartwright (Kathy Bates) and her dear friend Alice Pratt (Alfre Woodard), a working class woman of high ideals, have enjoyed a lasting friendship throughout many years.  Suddenly, their lives become mired in turmoil as their adult children&rsquo;s extramarital affairs, unethical business practices and a dark paternity secret threaten to derail family fortunes and unravel the lives of all involved. Alice&rsquo;s self-centered newlywed daughter Andrea (Sanaa Lathan) is betraying her trusting husband Chris (Rockmond Dunbar) by engaging in a torrid affair with her boss and mother&rsquo;s best friend&rsquo;s son William (Cole Hauser).  While cheating on his wife Jillian (KaDee Strickland) with a string of ongoing dalliances with his mistress Andrea, William&rsquo;s true focus is to replace the COO of his mother&rsquo;s lucrative construction corporation.  Meanwhile, Alice&rsquo;s other daughter Pam (Taraji P. Henson), a kind but no nonsense woman married to a hard working construction worker (Tyler Perry), tries to steer the family in a more positive direction.    While paternity secrets, marital infidelity, greed and unsavory business dealings threaten to derail both families, Charlotte and Alice decide to take a breather from it all by making a cross-country road trip in which they rediscover themselves and possibly find a way to save their families from ruin inTyler Perry's The Family That Preys.BeyondTyler Perry's The Family That Preyson DVDTyler Perry's Meet the Brownson DVDTyler Perry's Why Did I Get Marriedon DVDTyler Perry's Daddy's Little Girlson DVD", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001132GNY", "B000PE0GRI", "B0018RNF60", "B003Y5H56K", "B002ZG99RW", "B005LAIH1S", "B00097DXFS", "B002VKB0LU", "B000F9SO0O", "B0026JI1R2", "B008SOS7W8", "B003Y5H4ZC", "B00BEL4QFO", "B001QUF7DS", "B003Y5H58S", "B0055OTDCM", "B008FCX2D2", "B0009A40NE", "B00AZMFJ90", "B0009A40NY", "B003UEYBPI", "B000YAF4Q6", "B002VECM4A", "B001JV5BC6", "B0088RMEII", "B003L16FCC", "B00066FAQW", "B005LAIH86", "B00AJLHVES", "B008SOSB0G", "B001DJLCQS", "B000BQ7J8Y", "0783240201", "B000FA57JE", "B0009A40NO", "B00HW3EI3I", "B005KR6NNG", "B000XT1P52", "B0009A40O8", "B00CWBPQ22", "B0010YVCAW", "B000FA57IU", "B00JPFTW1E", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B0041H55SK", "B0041H55S0", "B00004Y2R1", "B007P9HVJC", "B00GOZ2LPM", "B0041H55RQ", "B002CA68NO", "B00BNV9WCW", "B002CAWNEM", "B00H47IX5G", "6305505780", "B00007L4KF", "B006IVNIS6", "B000A6T2KS", "B000F3UA5M", "B00066FAVW", "B0018RNF74", "B00AEFYHVO", "B00EJU9GQ6", "B000HDZKLO", "B00005JLG1", "B00AMEZDJW", "B008SOSCHS", "B005OK721G", "B001KKU9DM", "B00BYS0RQE", "B00000JGHV", "B00AEFXTKO", "B005DCJ3LM", "6305428409", "B0053YT3II", "B00066FAC6", "B00005ASOO", "B00003CY51", "B00AEFXY6I", "B000FUH35U", "B007SS7MAS", "B000VZADPG", "B002NZK5VO", "B00AEFYQWO", "B0034G4P1C", "B0018W2L1A", "B003VEL8ZS", "B000P0J092", "B000JLTRH2", "B0072GOJ98", "B007Q2GR9I", "B000BITV9W", "B00005ALM8", "1558908390", "B005KR6NQS", "B00005LB86", "B00005JPK8", "B00465I1CE", "B000XSWVEC", "B00005JNRM"], "bought_together": ["B001132GNY", "B003Y5H56K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003Y5H56K", "B000F9SO0O", "B00097DXFS", "B0018RNF60"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5943}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.89, "brand": "Lionsgate", "asin": "B000LW7REE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TziuSehYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Family That Preys (Full Screen Edition)"}
