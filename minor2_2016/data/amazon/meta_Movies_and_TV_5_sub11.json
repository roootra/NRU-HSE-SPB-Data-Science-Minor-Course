{"description": "Woody Allen's feature-film debut,Take the Money and Run, a mockumentary that combines sight gags, sketchlike scenes, and standup jokes at rat-a-tat speed, looks positively primitive compared to his mature work. Primitive, but awfully funny. Allen plays Virgil Starkwell, a music-loving nebbish who turns to a life of crime at an early age and, undaunted by his utter and complete failure to pull off a single successful robbery, continues his unbroken spree of bungled heists and prison breaks even after he marries and raises a family. Narrator Jackson Beck, whose stentorian voice of authority makes a perfect foil for Starkwell's absurd exploits, lobs one droll quip after another with deadpan seriousness. Though spotty, Allen tosses so many jokes into the mix that it hardly matters and when they hit they are often hilarious: the chain gang posing as cousins to their old-woman hostage (\"We're very close,\" Virgil explains to a dim cop), arguing with a dotty movie director who is supposed to be their cover for a bank robbery, Virgil's escape attempt with a bar of soap. Allen spoofs decades of crime films, everything fromI Am a Fugitive from a Chain GangtoBonnie and Clyde, but you don't have to know the movies to enjoy this goofy, sometimes clumsy, but quite clever comedy.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000068DV", "6303011411", "0792846117", "6300216365", "B00003CXGR", "6304785801"], "also_viewed": ["6302697042"]}, "price": 19.9, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 382476}, "asin": "0764003828", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TBXJ3E20L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Take the Money and Run [VHS]"}

{"description": "This is the restored, 209-minute director's cut of Wolfgang Petersen's harrowing and claustrophobic U-boat thriller, which was theatrically rereleased in 1997. Originally made as a five-hour miniseries, this version devotes more time to getting to know the crew before they and their stoic captain (J&uuml;rgen Prochnow) get aboard their U-boat and find themselves stranded at the bottom of the sea.Das Bootputs you inside that submerged vessel and explores the physical and emotional tensions of the situation with a vivid, terrifying realism that few movies can match. As Petersen tightens the screws and the submerged ship blows bolts, the pressure builds to such unbearable levels that you may be tempted to escape for a nice walk on solid land in the great outdoors--only you wouldn't dream of looking away from the screen.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CXHJ", "B0009RCPUC", "B009XTF8NI", "B0001NBMH6", "B00008K76U", "B00AEFYENK", "0304352314", "B00IJZW3QW", "B0001FGC1U", "B000021Y77", "0792841670", "6304765258", "B00005YUO1", "B00004XPPC", "B000274THQ", "B000EHSVS2", "B000EHSVSC", "B00005N5S3", "B00005JPKE", "B000E5N6KW", "B000NO1XJA", "B000OVLBGC", "0792839730", "B004VGHF7K", "B0007TKNGA", "B0000AMRUP", "B000O78L0U", "B0001NBMGC", "B00096S4B2", "B000H1RFQ4", "B00ID8H8EW", "B0001HLVS2", "B00005PJ8T", "B005HP2IYE", "B000MGTQ7K", "B00001ZWUS", "B00008AOTR", "B0009XRZI8", "B00079ZACC", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B00005AVZU", "B003ELKNH2", "B005HQBO9I", "B00005PJ8S", "B00005QCVP", "B005DTZXL4", "B00005JN9P", "B00AEFXVCU", "B0001WTWWE", "0790742047", "B00008PC0Y", "B00KHWSB5M", "B004ZJZQFG", "B0015D20FE", "B001TUZG4K", "B002KECJZ8", "079284646X", "B000MGTQ7U", "B00006ADD5", "B0000A02TY", "B0009A40EI", "B004R6EF9U", "B00008AOTO", "B000E5N63Y", "B00AEFYBA6", "B000M4RG42", "B000H5V8H2", "B00AEBBA36", "B00IVLR9JA", "B00009MEC4", "B00BTYNXL4", "B002QP145C", "B00BTYJYR6", "0792841409", "B004GJYRI2", "0792838408", "B000YKT4BW", "B002ID09BM", "B0051HCVEU", "B0037A4ILC", "B000TGCR38", "B00008AOTN", "B00005JKF6", "B000O599Z8", "B00008PC13", "B00B0U2SFE", "B003AWRMCO", "B000H1RFSM", "B0006B2A42", "B0012QE4PI", "B0006GANN2", "B006TTC5HC", "B0002XVS7Y", "B000I6BJ56", "B004QSQMPE", "B00005U8EN", "B008XJM7T2", "B000FZETR0"], "bought_together": ["B0001NBMH6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00IJZW3QW", "B00003CXHJ", "B009XTF8NI", "B0009RCPUC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 11970}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 16.47, "brand": "Columbia/Tristar Studios", "asin": "0767802470", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PPEJHCV3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Das Boot - The Director's Cut"}

{"description": "This thoroughly unpleasant thriller from the hands of Joel Schumacher (Batman and Robin) offers very little in its lurid tour of snuff films and the seedy pornographic underworld. A wooden Nicolas Cage stars as a private detective hired by a tycoon's widow, who discovers in her dead husband's safe some 8mm footage of a young girl being sexually abused and slaughtered. Cage's job is to determine the veracity of the film and to find out the girl's identity, whether she be alive or dead. What could have been a taut, nerve-jangling thriller is instead a lumbering, overwrought but underwritten tale of vigilante justice. Screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker also penned the imaginative and compellingSeven, but you wouldn't know it from this tired and monotonous script. Schumacher tries for echoes of bothThe Silence of the Lambsand Paul Schrader'sHardcore(which stars George C. Scott as a father trying to find his daughter in the seedy porn industry), but despite some slick camerawork, the film fails to draw the audience into either the mystery of the missing girl or Cage's supposed internal conflicts. It's not so much the unsavory subject matter as it is the sloppy and unimaginative filmmaking that makes the movie unbearable. Of the entire cast only Joaquin Phoenix, as a charismatic goth boy who works at an adult book store, comes away with a memorable performance.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003JRAB", "0783223218", "6303486746", "630470786X", "6302479487", "6304826133", "6301966899"], "also_viewed": ["B00012F6A6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 474128}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "", "asin": "076781956X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5136N2XDYBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "8mm [VHS]"}

{"description": "Robert Crumb is known for his disturbing, yet compelling, underground cartoons: his most famous works made countercultural icons out of Mr. Natural (\"Keep on Truckin'...\") and Fritz the Cat. Terry Zwigoff delves into the odd world of the cartoonist in his documentary filmCrumb, and the picture that emerges is not always pretty--at moments, it's almost repellent--but it's a fascinating glimpse into a very strange mind. Interviewing immediate family--Crumb has one suicidal brother, one semi-psychopathic brother, two sisters who declined to be interviewed, and a tyrannical mother--Crumb begins to look a bit saner. Given his surroundings, it's remarkable that he has survived so well. His hostilities toward women may turn some viewers off, but his wife, Aline, seems to be a grounding point, and she provides a solid counterbalance to the man.  No one shies away from discussing incredibly intimate things (namely, sex!), which explains much of R. Crumb's cartoons.

{"description": "This special-edition DVD gives the modern-day viewer a taste of what  movies were like in 1961. Four curious featurettes are included, produced as publicity for the film. James Darren narrates a little ditty at his honeymoon in Malta during filming; Irene Papas narrates a giddy, old-fashioned look at \"Two Girls on the Town.\" There's even a filmed bit with producer-writer Carl Foreman that showed once at the premiere. The 20-minute retrospective made in 1999 has the expected reminiscences from Gregory Peck and Anthony Quinn. Director J.&nbsp;Lee Thompson's audio commentary is a bit frustrating; he's now in his 80s, and most of his recollections are slow in coming.

Still, some background footage on the building of the Silverado town set and the weapons expert who trained the actors is good stuff for any fan of the film.

{"description": "In the vastly overrated 1998 bookEasy Riders, Raging Bulls, author Peter Biskind puts the blame for Hollywood's blockbuster mentality at least partially on Steven Spielberg's box-office success with this adaptation of Peter Benchley's bestselling novel. But you can't blame Spielberg for making a terrific movie, whichJawsdefinitely is. The story of a Long Island town whose summer tourist business is suddenly threatened by great-white-shark attacks on humans bypasses the potboiler trappings of Benchley's book and goes straight for the jugular with beautifully crafted, crowd-pleasing sequences of action and suspense supported by a trio of terrific performances by Roy Scheider (as the local sheriff), Richard Dreyfuss (as a shark specialist), and particularly Robert Shaw (as the old fisherman who offers to hunt the shark down). The sequences on Shaw's boat--as the three of them realize that in fact the shark is huntingthem--are what entertaining moviemaking is all about.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005B6ND", "6300183181", "0784011923", "0767825411", "6305814694", "B00000JGEI", "6303148352", "6303506291", "630018403X", "B00000490M", "6300214753", "6304932553", "630442972X", "6300269639", "B0000048S1", "B000005PFL", "6302765536", "6302091632", "6302824729", "6303344224", "6301570723", "6300247171", "B00008WFU5", "6305576173", "6300183467", "0790743213", "6304143184", "6303402348", "1558808221", "6303020089", "B000063UUL", "B00005B238", "6303212379", "B00005A8XX", "0790731436", "0783226152", "0790705141", "6300267881", "B00008WFU4", "6300181340", "630157401X", "6302921058", "6300214060", "6302968143", "1558802258", "0792102320", "6300214087", "6300268993", "B0000BWVBD", "B002GHHHL0", "6301888901", "B00005JKDQ", "6303122647", "6302800420", "6303610811", "6301827732", "6303540082", "6302374189", "0800198395", "6300214435", "6304071876", "6301208773", "B00000IO4G", "B00006G8LB", "B0087ZG7HK", "B00008DZ83", "6300214710", "6300215814", "630220366X", "6304457324", "0800116917", "B000059XY5", "6303212263", "6300216500", "6303236863", "630533577X", "6300213986", "6302415853", "6304935811", "6302820448", "B00004U8P4", "6300214311", "6301798503", "0793927501", "6300214370", "6302787564", "6304288433", "6300182878", "B000003KHS", "6301971809", "B000007OY0", "0790734079", "630336568X", "0790733927", "0790742322", "6301966988", "0764006770", "B000059XVO", "B00023BLXA"], "also_viewed": ["B00008WFU5", "6301792734", "6305814694", "B00005B6ND", "0784011923", "0767825411", "6300214060", "6300183181", "6300247171", "B00005A8XX", "6303506291", "B00006AL1C", "0792151712", "6304539258", "630018403X", "6305363668", "B00008WFU4", "B00000JGEI", "B00078XGO2", "6304117752", "6301574117", "0800116917", "B000005PPB", "B0056BE0SG", "6302091632", "080010367X", "6304143184", "6300216845", "6304539274", "6303148352", "0792158261", "B00000JS61", "0792839846", "6303212379", "0792837614", "0783222955", "0783221347", "0790700506", "6302921058", "6301797906", "6301976983", "6305123616", "6303402070", "6304429274", "1558807780", "B00005JKDQ", "6300214370", "6302936381", "B00000JGEK", "B0000AQZYM", "B00000JXVM", "B0007KTBIU", "0790734079", "6304039522", "6300214753", "B00005NCCP", "B005FHWWXQ", "B0087F7VSY", "B00KDU8HQQ"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 177995}, "asin": "0783216084", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514JQY1K3TL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jaws [VHS]"}

{"description": "Meet Joe Blackseemed almost fated to fail when it was released in 1998, but this romantic fantasy--a remake of 1934'sDeath Takes a Holiday--deserves a chance at life after box-office death. Although many moviegoers were turned off by director Martin Brest's overindulgent three-hour running time, those who gear into its deliberate pace will find thatMeet Joe Blackoffers ample reward for your attention.Brad Pitt plays Death with a capital D, enjoying some time on Earth by inhabiting the body of a young man who'd been killed in a shockingly sudden pedestrian-auto impact. Before long, Death has ingratiated himself with a wealthy industrialist (Anthony Hopkins) and pursues romance with the man's beautiful daughter (newcomer Claire Forlani), whom he'd briefly encountered while still an earthbound human. Under the assumed identity of \"Joe Black,\" he samples all the pleasures that corporeal life has to offer--power, romance, sex, and such enticing pleasures as peanut butter by the spoonful.But Death has a job to do, andMeet Joe Blackaddresses the heart-wrenching dilemma that arises when either father or daughter (the plot keeps us guessing) must confront his or her inevitable demise. The film takes its own sweet time to establish this emotional crisis and the love that binds Hopkins's semidysfunctional family so closely together. But if you've stuck with the story this far, you may find yourself surprisingly affected.

{"description": "Conan the Barbarian, the movie that turned Arnold Schwarzenegger into a global superstar, is a prime example of a match made in heaven. It's the movie that macho maverick writer-director John Milius was born to make, and Arnold was genetically engineered for his role as the muscle-bound, angst-ridden hero created in Robert E. Howard's pulp novels. Oliver Stone contributed to Milius's screenplay, and the production design by comic artist Ron Cobb represents a perfect cinematic realization of Howard's fantasy world. To avenge the murder of his parents, Conan tracks down the evil Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones) with the help of Queen Valeria (played by buff B-movie vixen Sandahl Bergman) and Subotai the Mongol (Gerry Lopez). Aptly described by critic Roger Ebert as &quot;the perfect fantasy for the alienated pre-adolescent,&quot; this blockbuster is just as enjoyable for adults who haven't lost their youthful imagination.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783225946", "B0001Z37HM", "B0000VD12I", "B004EPYZT4", "B00070FX5U", "B000RW3VCK", "B00AKGG828", "B00005JA8B", "B001W72VPW", "B00005N5S5", "0783225741", "B00AEFXT7W", "B00004XMSC", "B00004Y87O", "0790729342", "6305558167", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B00005JKIP", "B00ADW4I9O", "B001VLBDD0", "B0002J58HO", "B001JFZ118", "0985452331", "B000056WR3", "B00000ILDD", "B002ZD3V10", "0783226063", "B002GHHHME", "B000E8M0P6", "B00005N7Z1", "B0004Z33EG", "B0000014T1", "0790731932", "B0000AOX0F", "B00026ZG10", "B003XURDAY", "B000A2LV4W", "B002GHHHOM", "B0002CHK1S", "0783225504", "B0045HCJG2", "B0045HCJGC", "B000QUCQX8", "B000FC2FQA", "B0024FADD8", "079284646X", "B000BPL2FQ", "B0038ZITIE", "6305767866", "B0000C3I6U", "B00509KXVC", "B00006RCOC", "1558908846", "0783227434", "0790729695", "B007STBUHI", "B000056PMU", "B00009OWI1", "B004QSQMKE", "B003ELKNH2", "6304698798", "B00AEBBADG", "B00AEFXKUI", "B0009X768W", "0783226926", "0767810864", "B00004STDN", "B00008974J", "B00H1RMWYW", "B0006J28MS", "B00AEFY5B6", "0792846877", "B001DB6J50", "B003ASLJRC", "B00I9TDMRM", "B008CYDD7I", "B0045HCJKS", "B000GETUDI", "B000TJBN6W", "B00005LKHN", "B0019UGYK0", "B0045HCJ8A", "B000P0J0AG", "B000LC3IB0", "0783230370", "B00AEBB9NM", "B002AS466O", "B001AK3S4Y", "B0041KT3P8", "B000067FP6", "B000NQRR1Q", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00005A3KS", "B004XFZ4JK", "B000REQQGQ", "B00IZZDWKM", "0767847431", "6305692688", "B002NZK5SW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000VD12I", "B004EPYZT4", "B001JFZ118", "B0001Z37HM"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 220008}, "asin": "0783225768", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512P73YCSNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Conan the Barbarian"}
{"description": "The original 1960 version ofVillage of the Damnedis regarded as a classic of science-fiction and horror, and it remains one of the creepiest movies of its kind. Directed with occasional flair by John Carpenter, this 1995 remake trades subtlety for more explicit chills and violence, but the basic premise remains effectively eerie. In the tiny, idyllic town of Midwich, a strange mist causes the entire population to fall asleep, and when everyone awakes the town physician (Christopher Reeve) discovers that 10 women--including his wife and a local teenaged virgin--have mysteriously become pregnant. Their children are all born on the same day, with matching white hair and strange, glowing eyes, growing at an accelerated rate and raising Reeve's suspicion that they're not of Earthly origin. These demonic brats can control minds and wreak havoc with the power of their thoughts--so of course, they must be destroyed! Only Reeve knows how to get the job done, and his performance (the actor's last big-screen role before his paralyzing accident in 1995) grounds this otherwise superfluous remake with enough credibility to hold the viewer's attention. But for the real chills, definitely check out the original version--it's 20 minutes shorter but twice as spooky.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00027JYMG", "B0000AOX0A", "B00EALTVPA", "B0053TWVDC", "B0052DP1TA", "6305258287", "B005CFBZVG", "B00009PY4G", "B00D7AM5XU", "B000TUDBFC", "B0000AOX0F", "B00EALTWJ0", "B00AEFYDM2", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B00HW3EJ6Y", "B0002O7XW2", "B00DBNLAZW", "B00005N5RM", "B0052XU4BK", "B00A1AU72A", "B0009X76XC", "B00K1L4NBU", "B00IYJRIKO", "B000HCO86I", "B000AM6OQ2", "B000HEWEGC", "B00009PY2T", "B00AEBB91O", "B007XF0W3K", "B000G1ALDY", "B0001FVDQ4", "B00AEFYUW0", "B001B8XRT6", "B00EF0NY7W", "B00GHH9GSC", "B00004TS0G", "B000FFJZO2", "B004P7CMHI", "0790742462", "B00004Y87O", "B0026ICAOS", "B00CPTUNUG", "B00027JYNK", "B008SGMPVU", "B00008974J", "B004P7CN7W", "B0000AOX09", "B009IV2Z3M", "B00009NHC7", "B008874968", "1573624101", "B00C7E3EFU", "B001P3SAAI", "B003JFCG82", "B004XVMCN0", "B00GHH9IIA", "B008VF0Y0M", "B000V4UFZK", "B0002IQLH6", "B00003CY6P", "B00BW4S87U", "B00IQHPS6A", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00C2CDJ34", "B00096S48U", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B0002V7OI8", "B0024FADD8", "078062856X", "B000FGFBUS", "B00D7AM698", "B001AQMBNC", "B000TSIJWY", "B00000IQC4", "0783116926", "B00DOB3N56", "B0053TWV46", "B000RXVNDI", "B00005JOJE", "B00AGKH4MG", "B00KMAVPW0", "B00006FDCD", "B00AEBB91E", "B00BCMSY80", "B00003CWRF", "B00JJOY47I", "B00A429Y56", "B00D97DMBU", "B001ECDVKE", "B00079Z9WI", "B002NZK5SM", "B00004W3HF", "B005CFBZQ6", "B00ARWX9NG", "B0000AOX0E", "B002AS45VK", "B004BLJQOK", "B00HF00RJW", "B00D7AM5U8", "B000063UR0"], "bought_together": ["B00027JYMG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00027JYMG", "B0024FADBA", "B000AM6OQ2", "B0000AOX0F"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 44546}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.5, "brand": "Universal", "asin": "0783230427", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XFND15HNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Village of the Damned"}

{"description": "Following the successful 1998 video release ofCatscomes another Andrew Lloyd Webber blockbuster musical,Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, and it's a savvy choice. It hasn't been represented on film before, it's short enough (78 minutes) to present without cuts, and it has the star power of former teen icon Donny Osmond, who played over 1,800 performances across North America. Rather than record a live performance,Catsdirector David Mallet conceivedJosephas a film, though one that is based strongly on codirector Steven Pimlott's 1991 London revival and relies more on camerawork than venturing beyond its stagelike sets.Lloyd Webber's first project with lyricist Tim Rice was originally written in 1968 as a school cantata; accordingly, this film uses a framing sequence of a school recital, with an audience of clapping, singing kids and members of the faculty playing the roles. The Old Testament tale of Joseph and his coat of many colors gets a splashy, vigorous treatment with an energetic cast, Las Vegas-style glitz, and catchy, eclecticsongs, including \"Any Dream Will Do,\" \"Close Every Door,\" the peppy \"Go, Go, Go Joseph,\" and various bits of country, calypso, and Elvis. Osmond is perfect in the title role, with a strong voice and winning persona, while London stage veteran Maria Friedman performs well in the central role of the narrator. Richard Attenborough appears (and sings a little) as Jacob, and Joan Collins makes a brief, nonsinging cameo.Josephcertainly isn't revolutionary musical theater, but if you view it as a kids' show, it's a silly good time (though there are poignant moments too). Parents should note, however, that this production might warrant a little discretion due to one suggestive scene and some risqu&eacute; costumes.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000001E0A", "B00028HBIO", "B00004XMTJ", "0767827929", "B000BSM28O", "6304806418", "B000003JAN", "B00005NGAE", "B000RPCK2E", "B000001E34", "B00001PE59", "B0007TKNII", "B001LMAKAG", "B000056NX5", "B0013Z7RUC", "B000I2J6YG", "B00004W5VC", "B000ATQYVK", "B005SFR7YE", "B0000VCZKM", "B000VKL6RK", "B00008973A", "B0000AM6IY", "B0090XLDKY", "B00004Z4SE", "B002HK9IDQ", "B00004YNUM", "B005NFJAZS", "B000AABKWC", "B000HT3PGU", "B00BX8PG3Y", "B005S9EK5Y", "0793508398", "B000GDH9JQ", "B00005JL1P", "B002D0L0R2", "B000BZ9TKG", "B00DM3TKNU", "B00004WI56", "B00005OCMS", "B001LMAKAQ", "B003E66Y70", "B006GHA9QQ", "0792841638", "B001PO550A", "630530209X", "076781326X", "B009M1HJ3O", "B00003CXPD", "B000E1YVZU", "B000067D1R", "0767827651", "B008E8XBZG", "B00070HK24", "B002YICN6U", "B0044RFTCY", "B00AEFYTEY", "B004SEUJBE", "B000077VR3", "B004SIP9U6", "B00004YTY2", "B00005JM6A", "B004I2K4DY", "B00006D295", "B00J2T18EW", "B00AATV0WS", "B007P7UF0G", "B002NZK5TG", "B0000TB01Y", "B0045HCJ80", "B007XTDWKQ", "B00005JLIU", "B0047CG9F2", "B00AEFY5TI", "B0000VV4W2", "B00E9ZATKI", "B0045HCJJY", "B000HT3PGK", "B005GZ2CWS", "B00F0JGA6E", "B00JAOW3MA", "B008H6GHJM", "B00AEFXYOA", "B00004R99S", "B008CRC506", "B00AMSM9CW", "B00003CXC3", "B00C7JGDBW", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B00JDCORSC", "B00000JGOQ", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00AEFY6ZQ", "B0084IHVUC", "B00HWMP0OU", "B008YWY0HK", "B00005RRGB", "B00GOC75YW", "B00J89SH4A"], "bought_together": ["B00028HBIO", "B00004XMTJ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000001E0A", "B00004XMTJ", "B00028HBIO", "B000003JAN"]}, "price": 10.49, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1835}, "asin": "0783240287", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EFTGFT94L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat"}

{"description": "Alfred Hitchcock considered this 1943 thriller to be his personal favorite among his own films, and although it's not as popular as some of Hitchcock's later work, it's certainly worthy of the master's admiration. Scripted by playwright Thornton Wilder and inspired by the actual case of a 1920's serial killer known as \"The Merry Widow Murderer,\" the movie sets a tone of menace and fear by introducing a psychotic killer into the small-town comforts of Santa Rosa, California. That's where young Charlie (Teresa Wright) lives with her parents and two younger siblings, and where murder is little more than a topic of morbid conversation for their mystery-buff neighbor (Hume Cronyn). Charlie was named after her favorite uncle, who has just arrived for an extended visit, and at first Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotten) gets along famously with his admiring niece. But the film's chilling prologue has already revealed Uncle Charlie's true identity as the notorious Merry Widow Murderer, and the suspense grows almost unbearable when young Charlie's trust gives way to gradual dread and suspicion. Through narrow escapes and a climactic scene aboard a speeding train, this witty thriller strips away the fa&ccedil;ade of small-town tranquility to reveal evil where it's least expected. And, of course, it's all done in pure Hitchcockian style.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300183580", "6304039530", "1558807780", "6301670140", "0783221347", "0783235593", "6301798503", "0783235623", "6304039506", "6301975987", "630197350X", "6304429274", "6304359705", "6304457316", "6304119046", "6300183513", "6301798732", "6300215644", "6302909023", "B0000040EO", "630150528X", "0783222955", "6305123616", "0783217390", "0783235607", "6302278929", "6301797957", "6301798260", "B003MG6FJY", "0783235674", "6300158438", "6300215741", "6301564456", "0783235704", "6301327845", "6301586042", "6301800974", "B000003KE0", "0790733897", "6303020089", "0782008348", "6301977149", "6301969316", "6300183912", "6303364772", "6303957013", "1558804226", "6301973410", "B00004TX24", "6300988791", "630266232X", "6301973259", "6301670159", "0800100832", "0790743213", "6301640667", "6301969049", "B00004TYS8", "630196912X", "6302878535", "6302120101", "6300269264", "B00007JME0", "6302299497", "6302360978", "6300181421", "630160086X", "6302484421", "6302413435", "6300181340", "6302779782", "6302305942", "B0002IXSVI", "6301586026", "B00003OSTO", "0783235615", "6301964012", "079284517X", "0792837096", "B00000FZXC", "6302226899", "0783235682", "6300208133", "6301972171", "6302884705", "6302503493", "6302801133", "6303039693", "6304308418", "630196571X", "6301967682", "1558808590", "6303560067", "6305012792", "6300181723", "B000GX7MMA", "6303333079", "6301955625", "6301977815"], "bought_together": ["6300183580", "6301670140"], "also_viewed": ["6300183580", "6301670140"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 168467}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.5, "brand": "", "asin": "0783236352", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K145Q7XJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Shadow of a Doubt [VHS]"}

He's chilling as the futuristic cyborg who kills without fear, without love, without mercy. James Cameron's story and direction are pared to the bone and all the more creepy. But don't overlook the contributions of Linda Hamilton, who more than holds her own as the Terminator's would-be victim, Sarah Connor--thus creating, along with Sigourney Weaver inAlien, a new generation of rugged, clear-thinking female action stars.

{"description": "B-movie mavens turned A-list genre fiends Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino teamed up in 1996 to take vampire gothic south of the border into spaghetti Western territory for the gory cult filmFrom Dusk Till Dawn. The high-concept mix of southwestern criminals versus supernatural nasties proved too irresistible for either of the video-hound creators to allow it to remain dead (or undead, as the case may be), so they plotted and produced a pair of direct-to-video sequels. Tarantino takes a story credit on the first, a heist film coscripted and directed by Scott Speigel. A Mexican bank robbery helmed by drawling criminal Robert Patrick (Terminator 2) turns into a literal bloodbath when his crew are turned into hungry bloodsuckers. Speigel, a buddy of Sam Raimi, tops both Tarantino and Rodriguez for sheer cinematic acrobatics, putting his camera in the most absurd places (even from inside the mouth of a vampire chomping down on a victim) and driving the film with adrenaline-charged overkill, but despite some clever scenes and a hilariousPsychospoof, it turns into another aggressively trashy latex-mask and rubber-bat gorefest as cops and robbers team up against the fanged gang. Bo Hopkins costars as the police detective dogging Patrick's trail. Bruce Campbell and Tiffani-Amber Thiessen make cameos in the jokey opening sequence and Speigel and fellow director Kevin Smith briefly appear as vampire bait. Bartender Danny Trejo is the only returning cast member.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 618931}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0788817000", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71F7SMB0MCL._SY300_.gif", "title": "From Dusk Till Dawn 2 - Texas Blood Money [VHS]"}

{"description": "Stanley Kubrick dissects the nature of violence in this darkly ironic, near-future satire, adapted from Anthony Burgess's novel, complete with \"Nadsat\" slang. Classical music-loving proto-punk Alex (Malcolm McDowell) and his \"Droogs\" spend their nights getting high at the Korova Milkbar before embarking on \"a little of the old ultraviolence,\" such as terrorizing a writer, Mr. Alexander (Patrick Magee), and gang raping his wife (who later dies as a result). After Alex is jailed for bludgeoning the Cat Lady (Miriam Karlin) to death with one of her phallic sculptures, Alex submits to the Ludovico behavior modification technique to earn his freedom; he's conditioned to abhor violence through watching gory movies, and even his adored Beethoven is turned against him. Returned to the world defenseless, Alex becomes the victim of his prior victims, with Mr. Alexander using Beethoven's Ninth to inflict the greatest pain of all. When society sees what the state has done to Alex, however, the politically expedient move is made.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790734079", "0790705141", "B00004U8PA", "B00000FZCU", "6303953425", "6304484054", "0783235607", "6304039220", "630268644X", "B00006G8O1", "0790700506", "B0002G2B2W", "6305576173", "B000059HCI", "B00008X5J1", "0792837797", "B00000J2KZ", "6300267881", "6301977742", "6300216713", "6300269132", "B00000I1DI", "6302783356", "6300214826", "6305095566", "B00005JLET", "6302054982", "0800103106", "6302201845", "6302798450", "B00000J2L7", "6304994540", "6303686796", "B00005PJ8I", "6300216500", "0783228317", "6303107338", "6304935811", "B00004W5UA", "6302610702", "0783246641", "6300183211", "6302921058", "0792842111", "B00004T37H", "B00002E285", "B00003CXE6", "B000007OY0", "6301971582", "6300184064", "B00005LL26", "0790736039"], "bought_together": ["0790734079", "0790705141"], "also_viewed": ["0393312836", "0790705141", "B0013FSXT6", "B00GGAK0FS", "B008RO875Q", "B004O724M2", "B00004TLMC", "B00023NRSM", "B008M4MB8K", "6305440093", "6303953425", "6303939015", "6303148387", "6303861733", "B00003CXB4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 296220}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790701022", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EV1DQCCGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Clockwork Orange"}

{"description": "The come-from-behind winner of the 1981 Oscar for best picture,Chariots of Fireeither strikes you as either a cold exercise in mechanical manipulation or as a tale of true determination and inspiration. The heroes are an unlikely pair of young athletes who ran for Great Britain in the 1924 Paris Olympics: devout Protestant Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson), a divinity student whose running makes him feel closer to God, and Jewish Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross), a highly competitive Cambridge student who has to surmount the institutional hurdles of class prejudice and anti-Semitism. There's delicious support from Ian Holm (as Abrahams's coach) and John Gielgud and Lindsay Anderson as a couple of Cambridge fogies. Vangelis's soaring synthesized score, which seemed to be everywhere in the early 1980s, also won an Oscar.Chariots of Firewas the debut film of British television commercial director Hugh Hudson (Greystoke) and was produced by David Puttnam.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002HRKVS", "B000VNMMQG", "B000KX0IOA", "B000068MC2", "B000FEB9DS", "B001A4YNPI", "B0002C9D9U", "B00DX88ISM", "B000001F28", "0792843592", "B0001FR0JS", "B002VWNIBI", "1860248411", "1618430157", "B0001GH7W2", "B000EXZFCQ", "6304712936", "B00003CXBH", "B00005AUKE", "B000KJTGHO", "B000LPR6GA", "B000JLFNIY", "6305428352", "B00004W221", "B0007SWPV2", "B00CZNSGDS", "B0068FZ0GK", "1572931302", "B000EXDS4I", "B006FE83UE", "B0001US66Y", "B000056VP4", "B00371QQ5M", "B0001US8F8", "B002HK9IDQ", "B00005JKF6", "B000K144OM", "B004GJYRI2", "B004SIP7F8", "B000RPCK2E", "B00011D1OU", "0783225733", "B006TTC5B8", "B00BTYJYR6", "B0009S4IKQ", "B004K6FS5W", "B00AMSM9CW", "6305144168", "B000XJD34I", "B0006GAO5Y", "B0071PT92C", "B000JJ5G24", "B003LMPKSQ", "B002VECM6S", "B000BCKFSE", "B000MNOX94", "B003WLVHFQ", "B002NZK5UK", "B0002JAP5E", "0060137428", "B00B0LKT9U", "B000CEXEWA", "B007N31YH0", "B0072GPQNG", "B009NNM9OA", "B001MVYUPC", "B001GWUHNQ", "B00005JPBO", "B0045HCIXG", "B005SYZYYK", "B00HUFCKB0", "B000FTCLSA", "B0006FYOTC", "B0000JBALO", "B00006ADD5", "B000BITV92", "B00AEBB9QY", "B00003CXBU", "B00004XPPC", "B0050FXDDQ", "B00EV4EUT8", "B00005AUKB", "6304907729", "B000BMY2LK", "0618562095", "1563713942", "B00066FBQG", "B002VWNIAY", "0783240171", "0440011493", "B000URDCC6"], "bought_together": ["B000VNMMQG", "B0002HRKVS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001A4YNPI", "B00DX88ISM", "B000068MC2", "B000VNMMQG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 56263}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "Warner", "asin": "0790731010", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513WMCSN21L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Chariots of Fire"}
{"description": "When Tim Burton and Michael Keaton announced that they'd had enough of theBatmanfranchise, director Joel Schumacher stepped in (with Burton as coproducer) to make this action-packed extravaganza starring Val Kilmer as the caped crusader. Batman is up against two of Gotham City's most colorful criminals, the Riddler (a role tailor-made for funnyman Jim Carrey) and the diabolical Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones), who join forces to conquer Gotham's population with a brain-draining device. Nicole Kidman plays the seductive psychologist who wants to know what makes Batman tick. Boasting a redesigned Batmobile and plenty of new Bat hardware,Batman Foreveralso introduces Robin the Boy Wonder (Chris O'Donnell) whose close alliance with Batman led more than a few critics to ponder the series' homoerotic subtext. No matter how you interpret it, Schumacher's take on theBatmanlegacy is simultaneously amusing, lavishly epic, and prone to chronic sensory overload.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001OST0M6", "B000P0J06U", "B000P0J06K", "B00005JNJV", "B004LWZWGA", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00005LOUK", "B0006L0LOS", "B000IJ79X4", "B000IJ79XE", "B001CDR1FG", "B000IJ79WU", "B004YJMQDW", "B000J10EQU", "B00IZZDWKM", "B0000959N0", "B000AYELVA", "B00003CXE4", "B00005JKWJ", "B000AQOHNA", "B004LWZW42", "B00008G8M5", "B000IJ79UW", "0780624890", "B001DHXT20", "B002GSXKN8", "B0009UZG28", "B00005JNTU", "B000AYELVU", "B000A9QKLE", "B000A9QKL4", "B001GCUO1Q", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001VLBDD0", "B008JFUPFI", "B0090SI56Y", "B000068MBS", "B004EPZ07K", "B00081912E", "B005COPWZW", "0783235070", "B00BTYMPUY", "B004SIP9P6", "B000OYC7BW", "B00005JMQW", "B004SIP9O2", "B0007G89FU", "B001QB9H1U", "B000VI70QS", "B0014Z4ON4", "B000NIBURQ", "B001DJLD2G", "B000UR9T8C", "B00K7IPFSM", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000A9QKLO", "B000IJ79VQ", "B00F4FFO8E", "B00005JKCH", "B000ARXF96", "B0007V6ITE", "0790732157", "B0002IQMAM", "B00AEBB9SM", "B00005N5S5", "B000P0J06A", "B00GZ0ML2Y", "B00JL6L4UY", "B001AGXEAG", "B001ECDVKE", "B000GETUDI", "B005LAIHYU", "B008JFUS0U", "B001PPLIEG", "B000W1V5VU", "B001QTXM5Y", "B000HCO83Q", "B004SIP9MY", "6304765258", "B002GOAH1A", "B00JPS7HOA", "B00E5I2MCM", "B005LAIGW8", "B00006FI0R", "B00177YA1K", "B0007P0Y7C", "B001GCUO0W", "B0000B00KB", "B00080ZFZW", "B002GHHHN8", "B003AWRM9W", "B008JFUO72", "B00005JNTI", "B000HT38BM", "B0049IHWYG", "B00JF5GAIW", "B0009RCPY8", "B0000VCZMK", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B005J9ZFQG"], "bought_together": ["B001OST0M6", "B000P0J06U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002GSXKN8", "B000P0J06K", "B000B5XOSO", "B00005JNJV"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 161577}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.18, "brand": "Warner Bros", "asin": "0790731002", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51V0HRD00TL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Batman Forever"}
{"description": "When Prince's dazzling and dynamicPurple Rain(movie and soundtrack album) and the hypnotic hit single &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; exploded onto the pop-culture scene in 1984, it seemed there was nothing the purple one couldn't do. The film is basically a feature-length music video, but no musician has ever had a better big-screen showcase for his many talents.  The plot is really just a theme (about the son of an abusive father struggling not to continue the pattern) upon which to hang some of Prince's most dazzling songs (including &quot;Let's Go Crazy&quot; and the title tune), and some sizzling live-concert numbers.  Apollonia Kotero is ravishing as the romantic interest, and Morris Day and the Time provide some terrific musical competition.Purple Rainis an essential artifact of the mid-'80s pop Zeitgeist.

{"description": "When Ridley Scott's cut ofBlade Runnerwas finally released in 1993, one had to wonder why the studio hadn't done it right the first time--11 years earlier. This version is so much better, mostly because of what's been eliminated (the ludicrous and redundant voice-over narration and the phony happy ending) rather than what's been added (a bit more character development and a brief unicorn dream). Star Harrison Ford originally recorded the narration under duress at the insistence of Warner Bros. executives who thought the story needed further \"explanation\"; he later confessed that he thought if he did it badly they wouldn't use it. (Moral: Never overestimate the taste of movie executives.) The movie's spectacular futuristic vision of Los Angeles--a perpetually dark and rainy metropolis that's the nightmare antithesis of \"Sunny Southern California\"--is still its most seductive feature, an otherworldly atmosphere in which you can immerse yourself. The movie's shadowy visual style, along with its classic private-detective/murder-mystery plot line (with Ford on the trail of a murderous android, or \"replicant\"), makesBlade Runnerone of the few science fiction pictures to legitimately claim a place in the film noir tradition. And, as in the best noir, the sleuth discovers a whole lot more (about himself and the people he encounters) than he anticipates.... With Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, Daryl Hannah, Rutger Hauer, and M. Emmet Walsh.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783225903", "B004L9GMBC", "0783226063", "B00000ILDD", "0800195175", "B0018O4YT0", "B0007PALZ2", "B00004Y87O", "B003ELKNH2", "B00AEFYDM2", "B0002CHIKG", "B00005ATQB", "B00005JL78", "0790729342", "B0045HCJKS", "0767830555", "B0002CHK1S", "B00005N5S5", "B000063JDE", "B000P0J0AQ", "B00005R2IS", "B0013LL2Z2", "B00I9TDMRM", "B0045HCJ9O", "B008MIMWP8", "B0045HCJ0S", "B00005JLWN", "B00005N7Z1", "B000YBKO6U", "B0006GAOJA", "B0007DFJ0G", "B001WLMOL4", "B00003CXXP", "6304698798", "B00000JSJC", "B000286RP2", "B003AWRMCE", "B0040QYROA", "0783228457", "B004SIP9Z6", "B002ZG980U", "079284646X", "B00079Z9VO", "B002VWNIAY", "B00005J75F", "B005LAIHXQ", "B000VECAD0", "B0000VCZK2", "B00005PJ8T", "0345404475", "B001DJLD1M", "0792839056", "B0045HCJ9E", "B0050FXDDQ", "B0045HCJGC", "B004SIP95G", "B007STBUHI", "B00006ADD5", "B00GHJ1YUI", "B003ZXDP0Q", "B000A7DVR2", "0790731932", "B000NA1WGS", "B00AMSLDTM", "B008JFUN50", "B0068FZ0O2", "B000QUCQX8", "B000E6ESEO", "B00AEFXN9G", "B004FQX5B6", "B0002KVUKM", "B0016I0AJG", "B007FQXEWI", "B000N6TX1I", "B002VWNIDG", "B00ENNBZ68", "B00K5EJHGO", "B001VLBDD0", "078401213X", "0780022343", "B0018CMJSU", "B005LAII3A", "B000OVLBHG", "B006TTC5HC", "B0049985XW", "B0000844I8", "B00005JKFR", "B00AEFY3MC", "B000BZISSU", "0783226837", "6305133476", "B000022TSY", "B000FS9FCG", "B00070FX5U", "B008MIMWQW", "B00AEBBADG", "B004GJYRKA", "B002Z7FWBI", "B000BR9S96", "B00000K3TS"], "bought_together": ["B004L9GMBC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005LAIHXQ", "B009JBWOU0", "B00HUCF7AO", "B0018O4YT0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 68358}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.21, "brand": "WARNER BROTHERS", "asin": "0790729628", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ST8TQP63L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)"}
{"description": "EDITOR'S NOTE: According to a Warner Home Video technician involved in  the production ofThe Stanley Kubrick Collection, Kubrick authorized all aspects of theCollection, from the use of Digital Component Video (or \"D-1\") masters originally approved in 1989, to the use of minimalist screen menus, chapter stops, and (in the case of2001: A Space OdysseyandThe Shiningon DVD) supplementary materials. Full-screen presentation ofThe ShiningandFull Metal Jacketwas also approved by Kubrick, who recomposed his original framing,  reportedly believing that those films looked best on video in the full-screen format. (In fact, the original theatrical aspect ratio ofThe Shiningwas 1.66:1, meaning that a relatively small portion of the image is lost.) Kubrick also chose mono over stereo,  believing that inconsistencies in theatrical sound systems resulted in loss of control over theatrical presentation. In every respect, the Warner spokesman  said, the films in theCollectionremain as Kubrick approved them. Any future attempt to remaster or alter them would  have to be approved by an appointee of the Kubrick estate.", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301115430", "6300214826", "630018627X", "6304935811", "6301979761", "B00006C7G9", "B00000J2L7", "0784011923", "0790748169", "630407185X", "0800132009", "6302816580", "6301208773", "B00000JGEI", "B000BT8VVK", "B00000IO4G", "630018224X", "0792133153", "6300248135", "6302054982", "630300394X", "B00000K3AN", "6303696813", "6303020089", "6302415853", "6304826133", "6303029027", "0783235607", "6304259131", "B000065JH1", "0800179552", "6301217977", "B00007CVYA", "0800116917", "B0000CDL3W", "6304214502", "6302935148", "6304414099", "6303168507", "076783819X", "6300248089", "0800125762", "630018403X", "6300213005", "6303269834", "6303109950", "6300246965", "B00006IUOZ", "6300183211", "6304925131", "0783202253", "0783107986", "079213690X", "B000005XXG", "B00000FZCU", "0800187873", "6300214540"], "bought_together": ["6301115430", "6300214826"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 348239}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0790701251", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZM1C6TC7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Full Metal Jacket [VHS]"}

{"description": "While the series pilotBabylon 5: The Gatheringestablishes the characters and introduces the conflicts that will become central to the series, it also draws upon a rich history that is continually alluded to but never fully explained.Babylon 5: In the Beginning, produced in the hiatus between the fourth and fifth seasons of the series, packs all that history--and more--into a prequel stuffed to the hatches with the epic doings of Earth, Minbar, Narn, and Centauri in the days before theBabylonstations were built. Told in almost fairy-tale fashion by Londo Molari to a pair of children, the movie explicates the ill-fated first meeting between representatives of Earth and Minbar, the devastating war, the sudden surrender, and the universe-altering secret of Jeffrey Sinclair. It also gives the early histories of characters who will become central to the series, in particular Londo and G'Kar. Ostensibly created to catch recent converts up with the series as it made its transition to a new network, the movie is infused with the epic sweep and storytelling confidence producer-writer Michael J. Straczynski and his cast and crew had developed by the fourth season. It's an elegant, compelling addition to theBabylon 5universe and a dramatic highlight of the series. As an introduction, though, it gives away the mystery that pervades the shadowy history slowly revealed through the first three seasons--it's actually better seen from the vantage point of the fifth season.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000CEXFYW", "B002BAW6GS"], "also_viewed": ["B00005NTNP"]}, "price": 9.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 555635}, "asin": "0790736691", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X1T25ZCWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Babylon 5: In the Beginning [VHS]"}
{"description": "In the early spring of 1993, a year before the series was launched, the two-hour movie and series pilotBabylon 5: The Gatheringappeared. This proto-Babylonstaked out the initial territory for the series (some of which would change by the first episode), introducing primary characters and sketching out the alliances and rifts in interplanetary diplomacy. Some of the primary characters bowed out after their initial appearances (Tamlyn Tomita's Lt. Commander Laurel Takashima and Johnny Seka's Dr. Benjamin Kyle never returned; Patricia Tallman's telepath Lyta Alexander made periodic revisits beginning in the second season, eventually rejoining the cast permanently). Set on the first anniversary of theBabylon 5(none of the first four stations survived even a month), the central story involves the attempted assassination of the newly arrived Vorlon, the mysterious Ambassador Kosh, at the hands of (perhaps) Commander Jeffrey Sinclair (Michael O'Hare). Security Chief Michael Garibaldi (Jerry Doyle, a smart-aleck tough guy in the Bruce Willis vein) investigates and uncovers a web of conspirators, a portent of things to come. When TNT picked up the series for the fifth season Straczynski reedited the pilot, weaving back in a dropped subplot while cutting the rest of the film more tightly, tweaking special effects, and commissioning a new score from Christopher Franke. This is the cut released on video, a stronger, more engaging film, but still a broad first stab at characters that would redefine themselves through the course of the show's run.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00005NTNP"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 531868}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 4.83, "brand": "", "asin": "0790736683", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JM3XYQ4CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Babylon 5 - The Gathering (Series Pilot Film) [VHS]"}
{"description": "Director Oliver Stone added 17 minutes of previously unseen footage for the &quot;director's cut&quot; edition of his hypnotic courtroom epic about the investigation into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in November 1963. That fateful day in Dallas set in motion a sequence of events that would only intensify the mystery behind Kennedy's death, causing New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) to begin an investigation that would gradually become a personal obsession. Bravura filmmaking combined with controversial treatment of historical facts and audacious speculation, this breathtaking revision of history presents a mesmerizing parade of shady figures and conspiracy theories, unfolding like a classic mystery based on history's greatest unsolved crime. A technical triumph boasting Oscar-winning cinematography and editing, Stone's film is guaranteed to grab the viewer's attention with its daring take on the JFK controversy. The stellar supporting cast includes Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Jack Lemmon, Donald Sutherland, Sissy Spacek, Kevin Bacon, and Gary Oldman as Lee Harvey Oswald.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005J760", "B00000IQC0", "B00EO10IEE", "B00005JMA5", "B000CEXEWA", "1620872994", "B001TH92N4", "B002PTVMWO", "B00AMHFPK6", "B0002V7ON8", "B001MVWFAO", "B0032LV4MM", "1439193886", "B000BITUKC", "B006OFN0SE", "1616082917", "B00GM7SIWC", "B00GYG8BKK", "B00AEBB9NM", "B001KGDNAW", "B0019PL2JI", "079284646X", "0465031803", "B00ECXJBTM", "B000E1NXJ0", "B00013RC2U", "B00008W2OX", "B0045HCJHQ", "B003BV8I3Q", "B004YDSNMQ", "193806710X", "B000059TFO", "B00GJ0KQAE", "B000BT96PK", "B00005JXI7", "B004GJYRI2", "B00AEFY0F2", "0783225733", "B009AMANBA", "B002Q79WMM", "B000E5N6LG", "0792844874", "B000WMA73G", "B003AWRMCE", "B002PTVMX8", "1616082844", "B00441GYOM", "B0000A7W19", "B00AEBB89W", "B0001US6CI", "B00001ZWUS", "B000055Y0Y", "094178102X", "1616087080", "B000RTB0R6", "B00AMSTXSU", "078324021X", "B0068FZ0GK", "1897244673", "B0000542CJ", "B003AWRMC4", "B000P0J09M", "B00005NB8K", "0025718703", "B003A12WBQ", "0783240295", "B00F12IRSO", "B004SIP95G", "B000UX6TH0", "6304711891", "B00CPTUOI2", "B000G6BLHY", "0977795306", "B00A144O20", "B004SIP7TE", "B00000K3TX", "B0001CNRRU", "B00IXQV34U", "1937584747", "B00AZNEW5G", "B007RL2R9M", "B00ENP2QZA", "0312080743", "B000PAAJZ6", "1626361398", "B00005OLYF", "B0013XZ2QK", "B003ASLJQS", "B00005B6JZ", "B000P0J09C", "B00003CXTG", "0743269195", "B000CNESU8", "B008220DGE", "B00CLH08KC", "B000H5TH20", "B002NZK5VO", "0792159659", "B002M2Z3BA", "B000C20VPA"], "bought_together": ["B00005J760", "B000CEXEWA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007TBICMG", "B00005J760", "B00000IQC0", "B00E5QTWLI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 227128}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 17.89, "brand": "", "asin": "0790729733", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZR4S80ZFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "JFK - Special Edition Director's Cut"}

{"description": "Some critics complained thatCity of Angelscould never compare to Wim Wenders's exquisite German filmWings of Desire, which served as the later film's primary inspiration. The better argument to make is that any such comparisons are beside the point, becauseWings of Desirewas a much more deeply poetic, artfully contemplative film, whereasCity of Angelsis an enchanting product of mainstream Hollywood. Meg Ryan stars as Dr. Maggie Rice, a heart surgeon who is grieving over a lost patient when an angel named Seth (Nicolas Cage) appears to comfort her. She can see him despite the \"rule\" that angels are invisible, and Seth's love for Maggie forces him to choose between angelic immortality and a normal human existence on earth with her. Featuring heavenly roles for TV veterans Andre Braugher and Dennis Franz, the film liberally borrows imagery fromWings of Desire, but it also creates its own charming identity. Cage and Ryan give fine performances as lovers convinced they are soul mates, and although the plot relies on a last-minute twist that doesn't quite work, this earnest love story struck a chord with audiences and proved to be one of the surprise hits of 1998.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000062VP", "B002GIBVWA", "B00007GZR5", "B005F2JRUC", "0783233477", "B004SIP9RO", "B0000AOV4I", "6305692572", "B00AEFY4CG", "B000YDBPAM", "630471193X", "B004SIP8JI", "B000XJD33O", "B002IVDLGY", "B00008G7UF", "B002XTXGCK", "B00081U7HC", "0767810856", "B002GHHHNI", "B000HEWEE4", "B0000DIXDR", "B00AEBB8JM", "B003ASLJK4", "B00AEFYC96", "B000YAA68C", "B004SIP8LG", "B001HN69C2", "B002GOAGZC", "6304765266", "B0013D8LH2", "B0000A2ZO0", "B00AEBB8NS", "B000683VI4", "B002NZK5TQ", "B0017ANB08", "B00004Z4WR", "B0021L8V3Y", "B00AKGG6JS", "B000EHRVOW", "B00AEFY0F2", "6304711891", "6304806434", "B00006RCNY", "B00000IQW5", "B00000G3PA", "B00005NRO0", "0767811100", "B0009OL7Z4", "B000XT1P34", "B002K0WBXW", "B00AEBB9WI", "B00004W46I", "B005LAIGSM", "B00005JKZH", "6305428034", "B00AEFXT1S", "076784744X", "B004SIP9VA", "B000023VTP", "6305212112", "B0017ANAZO", "B00C6F61HS", "B00003CXL7", "B00004BZIY", "0783230079", "B0041KKYHE", "B002O3Z4WK", "B000P0J0DS", "B0045HCJJ4", "B000BBOUW2", "0800141849", "B000053VB5", "B003AWRMBA", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B00005BCKF", "B00012QLB4", "0792838068", "B0001Z3TXE", "B00005JA9F", "B00005JKIS", "B00006ZXSQ", "6305718954", "B00AEFXKUI", "B001LPWGGY", "B00000JGHK", "B0002WZTOI", "B000059TG6", "B002NZK5VO", "B000BYA5G4", "B00004TJKK", "B00866JL96", "B000ARTN3I", "B003L20IHE", "B00006ZXSN", "B00009WVSL", "B002NZK5V4", "6305236569", "B0006GANOQ", "B00004WG2F"], "bought_together": ["B00007GZR5"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000NA1WDQ", "B005F2JRUC", "0783233477", "B00007GZR5"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 81839}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "0790737345", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510332ZGT1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "City of Angels"}

{"description": "Black comedy and suspenseful action inside a German POW camp during World War II--a setting that was later borrowed for the TV sitcomHogan's Heroes. The great director Billy Wilder adapted the hit stage play, applying his own wicked sense of humor to the apparently bleak subject matter. William Holden plays an antisocial grouse amid a gang of wisecracking though indomitable American prisoners. Because of his bitter cynicism, Holden is suspected by the others of being an informer to the Germans, an accusation he must deal with in his own crafty way. Holden, who had delivered a brilliant performance for Wilder inSunset Boulevard, won the 1953 Best Actor Oscar forStalag 17. Very much his equal, however, is Otto Preminger, an accomplished director himself, who plays the strict, sneering camp commandant.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["079284517X", "B00005Q4GY", "B00000F13T", "B0009QAT6U", "0783222955", "6303168507", "6302909023", "6301973240", "6302682606", "6304071876", "6300181472", "6305110859", "1558807780", "6304196954", "6301977297", "6302529484", "0790752395", "6300251012", "6302529441", "6303686745", "6300246965", "630150528X", "6300246868", "0800132009", "0800116917", "B0000048YO", "6302224489", "6302952581", "6301798732", "6304111398", "0783217528", "6301797906", "6301959728", "6300213676", "0790732017"], "bought_together": ["B00005Q4GY", "B00000F13T"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 315192}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0792108280", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71NMB5C9AZL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Stalag 17 [VHS]"}
{"description": "Novelist Leon Uris wrote the script for this Western directed by John Sturges (The Magnificent Seven) and based on the life and times of Wyatt Earp (Burt Lancaster) and his sickly companion, Doc Holliday (Kirk Douglas). The action inevitably leads to the legendary battle between the two heroes and the villainous Clanton gang, but the film is also very much about the conflicts each man faces with women, with one another, and with their own destinies. Lancaster is terrific as the downbeat Earp, and Douglas has one of his best roles as the consumptive Holliday. The thoughtfulness of the tale is matched by Sturges's captivating way with the dramatic duel. All in all, the film appeals both as a solid action piece and as a fascinating, two-character study.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305237115", "6301395395", "6301977297", "B000A9QK8M", "B0007MAO0C", "6301801733", "B00005JLUH", "6303393985", "6303257801", "6301798759", "6304111363", "0800100832", "0792107683", "6304429711", "079283853X", "0792110188", "6302718961", "0792837371", "B000056BRF", "0783222955", "B000BWIZRW", "0792106989", "079284517X", "0792838548", "6303269826", "0792110463", "6300215830", "6304457316", "B00005RRG6", "0783227221", "1558807780", "0792839846", "B00000FZCU", "6300269043", "6301805615", "6301805518", "B00000F6D1", "630152859X", "6300269639", "0784001294", "6304291698", "B00000F13T", "6301798600", "6300268799", "B00004RFFA", "6301628454", "6302503515", "B00004WZR1", "6301972341", "0767809262", "6303282237"], "bought_together": ["6301395395"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 358567}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.97, "brand": "", "asin": "079210952X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51A721QDFTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gunfight at the O.K.

{"description": "Legendary silent film director Cecil B. DeMille didn't much alter the way he made movies after sound came in, and this 1956 biblical drama is proof of that. While graced with such 1950s niceties as VistaVision and Technicolor,The Ten Commandments(DeMille had already filmed an earlier version in 1923) has an anachronistic, impassioned style that finds lead actors Charlton Heston and Yul Brynner expressively posing while hundreds of extras writhe either in the presence of God's power or from orgiastic heat. DeMille, as always, plays both sides of the fence as far as sin goes, surrounding Heston's Moses with worshipful music and heavenly special effects while also making the sexy action around the cult of the Golden Calf look like fun.

{"description": "When the theatrical release of James Cameron'sTitanicwas delayed from July to December of 1997, media pundits speculated that Cameron's $200&nbsp;million disaster epic would cause the director's downfall, signal the end of the blockbuster era, and sink Paramount Studios as quickly as the ill-fated luxury liner had sunk on that fateful night of April&nbsp;14, 1912. Some studio executives were confident, others horrified, but the clarity of hindsight turned Cameron into an Oscar-winning genius, a shrewd businessman, and one of the most successful directors in the history of motion pictures.Titanicwould surpass the $1&nbsp;billion mark in global box-office receipts (largely due to multiple viewings, the majority by teenage girls), win 11&nbsp;Academy Awards including best picture and director, produce the best-selling movie soundtrack of all time, and make a global superstar of Leonardo DiCaprio. A bona fide pop-cultural phenomenon, the film has all the ingredients of a blockbuster (romance, passion, luxury, grand scale, a snidely villain, and an epic, life-threatening crisis), but Cameron's alchemy of these ingredients proved more popular than anyone could have predicted. His stroke of genius was to combine absolute authenticity with a pair of fictional lovers whose tragic fate would draw viewers into the heart-wrenching reality of theTitanicdisaster. As starving artist Jack Dawson and soon-to-be-married socialite Rose DeWitt Bukater, DiCaprio and Kate Winslet won the hearts of viewers around the world, and their brief but never-forgotten love affair provides the humanity that Cameron needed to turnTitanicinto an emotional experience. Present-day framing scenes (featuring Gloria Stuart as the 101-year-old Rose) add additional resonance to the story, and although some viewers proved vehemently immune to Cameron's manipulations, few can deny the production's impressive achievements. Although some of the computer-generated visual effects look artificial, others--such as the sunset silhouette ofTitanicduring its first evening at sea, or the climactic splitting of the ship's sinking hull--are state-of-the-art marvels. In terms of sets and costumes alone, the film is never less than astounding. More than anything else, however, the film's overwhelming popularity speaks for itself.Titanicis an event film and a monument to Cameron's risk-taking audacity, blending the tragic irony of theTitanicdisaster with just enough narrative invention to give the historical event its fullest and most timeless dramatic impact.Titanicis an epic love story on par withGone with the Wind, and like that earlier box-office phenomenon, it's a film for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305123616", "6304117752", "6301792734", "6303215734", "B00000JS61", "6304178352", "6303396623", "6303314015", "B00003CXTF", "0769403468", "6301734734", "6302936381", "6303300480", "6305368139", "B00005RRG3", "6302610702", "0792839846", "6300207919", "B000P0J0C4", "6304546262", "B000056BRF", "6304400551", "6303101267", "630150528X", "6303637574", "B000P0J0EW", "6305126062", "6302935148", "0800199421", "6304681496", "0792116887", "6301963911", "B0000DCGT1", "B00001IVED", "6305169187", "B00006RCST", "6300216721", "630197879X", "0800113055", "076780922X", "080010367X", "0800141326", "0800184319", "6304039522", "B000066AXC"], "bought_together": ["6305123616"], "also_viewed": ["B009VQHDSQ", "6303314015", "B0074JODXU", "B00003CXTF", "B003JQZXWW", "6302787068", "6301796535", "0788812807", "0788806270", "B00005JKDQ", "6304500831", "6305229449", "6304117752", "6300213668", "6304089767", "B0000AQZYM", "079213690X", "6303049079", "6305123616", "6303402348", "6301792734", "0788812408", "B00079HZSE", "B000035Z2S", "B00000K3AN", "0788805843", "6302526574", "B0000029YC", "6303534422", "6303215734", "B0070285YE", "B00008LDO9", "0783216084", "6304434340", "B00BBND56G", "0788805533", "6300183211", "6302320402", "6305750750", "B0002CHI3S", "0790748266", "6304143184", "B0000040CM", "B005X7H9SQ", "B00004RFHF", "B00005V1Z7", "6302814782", "6301572688", "B00000JS61", "B008SLUWZG", "6303257844", "B00078XGO2", "0790736039", "B0000040EJ", "B000065U6Q", "B00003CX7L", "B00000ADKZ", "6300263673", "6302178924"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 65950}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.47, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "0792151712", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21BAWEVBJ1L.jpg", "title": "Titanic [VHS]"}
{"description": "Jack Finney's classic science fiction novel has been the basis of three big-screen adaptations, beginning with the 1956 chillerInvasion of the Body Snatchersand most recently as 1994's underratedBody Snatchers. This acclaimed 1978 version from director Philip Kaufman (The Right Stuff) is every bit as creepy as the '56 original, and it fits perfectly into the cycle of paranoid thrillers that thrived in American movies of the 1970s. Kaufman stylishly directs from an intelligent screenplay by W.D. Richter, while Donald Sutherland and Brooke Adams lead a distinguished cast (including Jeff Goldblum, Leonard Nimoy, and Veronica Cartwright) and must fight for survival as the population of San Francisco is systematically cloned by alien &quot;pods&quot; from a distant, dying planet. The atmosphere of dread and paranoia grows increasingly intense as the complexity of the alien invasion is gradually revealed, until nobody can be trusted to be who they appear. Finely tuned performances enhance the film's eerie atmosphere, highlighted by moments that will lurk in your memory long after the movie's over. MGM's DVD release includes a full-length audio commentary by Kaufman, a &quot;pod culture&quot; retrospective,Body Snatcherstrivia, production notes, and the original theatrical trailer.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B007Y1NNAW", "B00005JPUN", "B0045HCJ8A", "B000AQKU72", "B0045HCJKS", "B00009NHC0", "B00AEBB8VK", "B00005JKFR", "B00518A70E", "B000063UR0", "B000FVQLKW", "B0013D8LAE", "B0045HCJSA", "B0087ZG7PW", "B00026L8US", "B00008438U", "B00000IQC4", "B000V4UFZK", "B0013LL2Z2", "B000EHQTZO", "B000VECAD0", "B000QGEB1W", "B001GCUO0W", "B006TTC5J0", "B000RXVNDI", "B0016I0AJG", "B00AEBB94G", "B00001TZ6Q", "B000P0J0BU", "B001D5C1OO", "B004L9GMBC", "B0045HCJJE", "B001BGS17Q", "B000FFJZO2", "B000O78KWE", "6304723113", "B000FOPPEC", "B00009NHBC", "0783225903", "B000E6ESEY", "B00006G8K0", "B00158K1EQ", "B00153ZR8G", "B000EHSVNW", "B002NZK5U0", "B00005LC4L", "B0006B2A42", "B00007JMD8", "0783240953", "B000HEWEDK", "B004LB5FAO", "B000063UR1"], "bought_together": ["B007Y1NNAW", "B000AQKU72"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007Y1NNAW", "B00005JKFR", "B0045HCJSA", "B00009NHC0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 106455}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.45, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "0792838416", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41y7q27x8nL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Invasion of the Body Snatchers"}
{"description": "The first feature film to be photographed and projected in the panoramic three-camera Cinerama process, this epic Western is almost as expansive as the West itself, chronicling a pioneering family's triumphs and tragedies in numerous episodes spanning three generations and a half century of westward movement. Divided into five segments directed by veteran Hollywood filmmakers Henry Hathaway, George Marshall, and the legendary John Ford (and including uncredited sequences directed by Richard Thorpe), the film was one of the most ambitious ever made by the venerable MGM studio. Its stellar cast reads like a virtual who's who of Hollywood's biggest stars. Debbie Reynolds plays a sturdy survivor of many pioneering dangers, and the eventual widow of a gambler (Gregory Peck), who is later reunited with her nephew (George Peppard), a Civil War veteran and cavalryman who heads for San Francisco as the transcontinental railroad is being built. Many more characters and stories are woven throughout this epic film, which is dramatically uneven but totally engrossing with its stunning vistas and countless outdoor locations in Illinois, Kentucky, South Dakota, Monument Valley in Arizona, California, Colorado, and elsewhere.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008CMT3", "B000056H2H", "B00E3QJ8DC", "B006VRRGOO", "B00AEFXUL2", "6304696612", "B00009AVA5", "B000O599Y4", "B00BXTDVEO", "B000O59A0C", "B00AEFYL6K", "B000O599ZS", "B0082LUFA4", "0783228031", "B000O77LY2", "B000O599NK", "078322592X", "B00393SG0G", "B0045HCJSK", "B000ANVPP6", "B000OT6V0U", "B00BGQ2P9G", "B00008CMR6", "B000FTCLQC", "B000O599YE", "B00008MTW5", "B0009ML2KQ", "B00AEFYPHA", "B00AEBB8YM", "B00AEBB932", "B000O599YY", "B005GZ2CWS", "B00008MTW6", "B000ANVPPQ", "B009YX8MSG", "B000G6N0HI", "B007Y1NR1W", "B000BT96DW", "B00J9BZ4KC", "B00BAXTY7G", "B00004TJQK", "B00004ZBVE", "B00AMDA2OY", "B00004XMV9", "B000O599NA", "B00E4DJK78", "B00BFWKE62", "B0007US7FI", "B000O599WQ", "0783230478", "B000O599VM", "B000059TFU", "B000NQRR34", "B00AEFYBA6", "B0009ML2JC", "B00008MTW7", "B00AEFY6ZQ", "B00C3ALLPS", "B000056H2E", "B000QRI1GW", "B000031EGW", "B000O599ZI", "B00IU6HPIQ", "B000N3T0GY", "B000O599YO", "B003ASLJRC", "B003NF97MQ", "B00FNR9YY8", "B00005PJ8S", "0792838408", "B0001Z3I0I", "B00A92MCNW", "B0007PALM0", "B00AEFXSVE", "B005AMJ38S", "B000BPL2FG", "B009INAI02", "B0014BJ1A4", "B00CFHEE08", "B00005ASGH", "B0007MANZI", "B001B187NO", "B00132D7Y0", "B004GSVX8A", "B0007MANYY", "B004DY1VIO", "B0009X75WE", "B001D7T6BI"], "bought_together": ["B00008CMT3", "B000056H2H"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BXTDVEO", "B00J9BZ4KC", "B000056H2H", "B00IU6HPIQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 315351}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 30.49, "brand": "", "asin": "0792839072", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61HH9Y5XTJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "How the West Was Won"}
{"description": "InThe Bad and the Beautiful, Kirk Douglas plays a tyrannical, manipulative producer fallen on hard times. To get back on his feet, he asks for help from three Hollywood giants whose careers he helped launch--a director (Barry Sullivan), an actress (Lana Turner), and a writer (Dick Powell). Unfortunately, they all hate him. Flashbacks explain why. Douglas had been close to all three at different points in his career: He and the director started out together making B-movies, he gave the wayward actress her first starring role, he turned the novelist into a successful screenwriter.  Then in one way or another he stabbed each of them in the back, though not always deliberately. The script has a lot of backstage  clich&eacute;s, but Vincente Minnelli's sharp, energetic direction, the gorgeous black-and-white  cinematography, and the topnotch performances--particularly Douglas and Gloria Grahame, who won an Oscar for her sweet role as the writer's cheerful Southern wife--flesh out the clich&eacute;s with cutting details and convincing bile. Caustic, starry-eyed, and slyly funny,The Bad and the Beautifulis a strange and skillful blend of \"If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere\" pluck and poisonous cynicism, one of the great movies about making movies.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303391931", "078200847X", "6304628188", "6301491920", "6302000661", "6302227135", "6300183890", "0783215096", "6300183874", "6301968891", "6303364772", "0792839846", "6304508557", "6301969316", "630266232X", "6301564456", "0790743531", "0792845951", "6302375827", "6302278929", "B00000493Q", "0783215517", "630197350X", "0792844564", "6301967410", "079284517X", "6300273202", "6300216012", "6304308418"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 448211}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.93, "brand": "", "asin": "0792840038", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C42P8QFDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Bad and the Beautiful [VHS]"}

Forging a vibrant and yet detached style of action that had not been seen before, and has never been matched since, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly shatters the western mold in true Clint Eastwood style.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792837312", "6304429711", "0790751216", "079284100X", "6300269043", "0790731975", "6300182452", "6300214826", "6302186161", "6300216500", "6300183211", "0792107128", "0783226152", "6305576173", "6302054982", "6303109950", "6304457278", "6300182533"], "bought_together": ["0792837312", "079284100X"], "also_viewed": ["0792837312", "0792158261", "6305363668", "6304429711", "0800116917", "B00005B238", "6300182576", "6300269043", "6300215830", "0790731975", "6300182533", "B00HZN8TBC", "079284100X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 400800}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0792842499", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HYPTT6ATL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly [VHS]"}

{"description": "One of the more upbeat and accessible films by acclaimed Swedish director Ingmar Bergman. Written by Bergman, this autobiographical story follows the lives of two children during one tumultuous year. After the death of the children's beloved father, a local theater owner, their mother marries a strict clergyman. Their new life is cold and ascetic, especially when compared to the unfettered and impassioned life they knew with their father. Most of the story is seen through the eyes of the little boy and is often told in dreamlike sequences. Colorful, insightful, and optimistic, this is far less grim than most of Bergman's work. It was awarded four of the six Oscars for which it was nominated, including Best Foreign Language Film. Though this was announced as his last film, Bergman continued to work into the late 1990s, though mostly for Swedish television.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304209584", "6303107338", "6302641888"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 463606}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.11, "brand": "", "asin": "0792840240", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4162EFCVM8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fanny and Alexander [VHS]"}

Director Rob Reiner poses important questions about the rights of the powerful and the responsibilities of those just following orders in this classic courtroom drama.", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304259131", "B000007OY0", "6302935148", "0792116887", "B00004WIDB", "6302816629", "6300214222", "6300214567", "6303269834", "6302989787", "0790748169", "0792133153", "B00000K3AN", "6304618344", "080018789X", "6303257844", "0783222955", "6302820448", "6300214540", "6301247485", "6302415853", "6303402348", "630179513X", "6301666569", "6303168507", "6300214826", "6305718792", "B00003CXE6", "6303212379", "B00003JRAB", "079213690X", "B001TODCII", "6301578805", "6304458975", "0800142039", "6300183211", "6300267970", "B00003G1FZ", "630419949X", "6300263673", "6300269043", "B0002GTWOM", "B00329TVQA", "6303908306", "6303020089", "0800132009", "0792841778", "B00008KDHM", "0790751089", "B000006N70", "6301627768", "B00000IO4G", "079212569X", "0783202253", "6303696813", "B00003CXFU", "6304258984", "6302881005", "0800179552", "0792147618", "0783223218", "6304935811", "6303313345", "0800199421", "B0001E7LQG", "6302909023", "0790735423", "0783204914", "630407185X", "0800125789", "6305622825", "0790731274", "6301976061", "6302945089", "6301976983", "6304155972", "0790701251", "0800116917", "6302779278", "0790734516", "6302822688", "0790705141", "0790731975"], "bought_together": ["6304259131", "6302935148"], "also_viewed": ["6304233639", "6300213668", "6305750750", "080010367X", "0792116887", "B000062XM6", "6302935148", "079213690X", "6302415853", "6303824382", "6303402348", "B000005QWI", "B001680M26", "6305169187", "630382790X", "0783225733", "080018789X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 84448}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0800125762", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41S81CR5D4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Few Good Men [VHS]"}
{"description": "Just what the world needs, another riff on that post-Psychohorror clich&eacute;: the slasher movie. In this version, which considerably dumbs down the Lois Duncan book, the bad guy chases naughty teenagers with a hook, all the while dressed as a dark version of the Gorton's fisherman. They seem to have killed someone in a car accident while out partying, and a price must be paid. Nothing new is added to the genre, though it would be unfair not to note that this does have some scary moments. That is about all it has, because as much as this wanted to be anotherScream, it hasn't the heart or the script. It does, however, have the requisite cast of small-screen stars (includingParty of Five's Jennifer Love Hewitt and Buffy herself, Sarah Michelle Gellar) to have snagged box-office success, spawning a sequel.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767826728", "0792151712"], "bought_together": ["0767826728"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 332658}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.8, "brand": "", "asin": "0800184319", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/7107W97AXAL._SY300_.gif", "title": "I Know What You Did Last Summer [VHS]"}
{"description": "One of the best romantic comedies of the 1990s, this box-office hit cemented writer-director Cameron Crowe's reputation as &quot;the voice of a generation.&quot; Crowe could probably do without that label, but he's definitely in sync with the times with this savvy story about a sports agent (Tom Cruise) whose fall from grace motivates his quest for professional recovery, and the slow-dawning realization that he needs the love and respect of the single mom (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger in her breakthrough role) who has supported him through the worst of times. This is one of Cruise's best, most underrated performances, and in an Oscar-winning role, Cuba Gooding Jr. plays the football star who remains Jerry Maguire's only loyal client on a hard road to redemption and personal growth. If that sounds touchy-feely, it is only because Crowe has combined sharp entertainment with a depth of character that is rarely found in mainstream comedy.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000065V3G", "B0000YEEGM", "B000GAKDAG", "0767811100", "B0018QPPXW", "B0002WZTOI", "B00005B6JZ", "B00AEFXR1K", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00AEBB9WI", "0783226810", "B00081U7HC", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFXYJA", "B000XJD33O", "B00AEBB9LO", "B000G6BLHY", "B0068FZ0GK", "B000023VTP", "B004SEUJK0", "B00158K0QU", "B000MNOX94", "B00AEFXESQ", "B001ECDVK4", "B000957O82", "B0000DIXDR", "0780631536", "0783225733", "B00004W221", "B000EGDB10", "B0010YSD8Q", "B000056VP4", "630471193X", "B00005JG6N", "B000P0J0EW", "B00005JL78", "0800141806", "B00005JKG9", "0790730979", "B002VECM6S", "B0000AOV4I", "B000CCBCAS", "B000HRMAPE", "B0006GANPA", "6305236569", "B00005O5CM", "B00011CZRE", "B0038Z5T4Q", "B000053VB4", "B003ASLJQS", "B0000524E4", "B00AEFXE9U", "B00006ZXSL", "078324021X", "B000765IJK", "B00AEFY99O", "B00AEBB8NS", "B0002V7ON8", "B00015YVDG", "B002AT8KD8", "B007SPPANM", "0783233477", "B000035Z5G", "B007STBUHI", "B004SIP9U6", "B000E5N684", "B00AEFXYOA", "B001LGXIA6", "B002GOAGZC", "B000FI8MPW", "B002O3Z510", "B000N6U0E2", "B000069HZP", "B00AEFY5B6", "B000068NNU", "B00001ZWUS", "B004AOECXI", "B00AEFXN9G", "B000YDBPAM", "B002ZG9864", "B003QO8TOQ", "0792843592", "B0013FCWUW", "B000P0J0EM", "B000QQLVPQ", "B000HEWEE4", "B0001AVZA8", "B00000G3PA", "B000XT1P3E", "B0006N2EZ0", "B00008G8LM", "B00005JNTI", "6304765266", "B00AEFXT1S", "B003UESJHO", "B00004WG2F", "B00005T7HW", "B004L3AR0K", "6305128952"], "bought_together": ["B0002WZTOI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001680M26", "B0002WZTOI", "0792838467", "B000065V3G"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8726}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.0, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "0800141741", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KBVJ813VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jerry Maguire"}

{"description": "Like many other films by Canadian director David Cronenberg (especiallyCrash),Dead Ringerspresents the cinematic and psychological equivalent of an automobile accident--you dare not look, but you can't turn away. The film marked a directorial breakthrough for Cronenberg, who was able to continue some of the themes explored in his earlier horror films while graduating to a higher, more critically \"respectable\" level of artistic sophistication. The film is loosely based, amazingly enough, on a true story about twin gynecologists who routinely traded each others' identities, lives and even lovers. Utilizing innovative split-screen technology (years before computer manipulation made such trickery much easier), the film stars Jeremy Irons in flawless dual roles as the identical brothers Beverly and Elliot Mantle. Their ability to instantly switch identities leads them to a shared relationship with a well-known actress (Genevieve Bujold) and, ultimately, a physical and psychological tailspin that sends them both to the brink of madness and death. The scenario suggests that both men are halves of a whole, and that one cannot exist without the other. But when Beverly pursues a kinky, drug-addicted affair with the actress, his more self-controlled brother is helpless to prevent their mutual decline. In this wayDead Ringersbecomes a fascinating and stylistically clinical study of duality, and Cronenberg doesn't shy away from the dark and unpleasant aspects of the story.

{"description": "Director Marty DiBergi (Rob Reiner) solemnly alerts us to the glory that was Spinal Tap in his introduction to this \"rockumentary\" about the legendary British heavy-metal group, featuring lead guitarist Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest), lead singer David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean), bassist Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer), and a succession of drummers whose careers were cut short by spontaneously combusting on their stool, drowning in somebody else's vomit, or otherwise perishing in untimely fashion. Under DiBergi's studious interrogation, the band and their familiars retrace the band's evolution from head-bopping Mersey Beat poseurs to head-banging metal poseurs, each change in musical direction or tonsorial chic having little effect on the surviving trio's sublime idiocy. For, as St. Hubbins (he's the \"deep\" one, relatively speaking) sagely observes, \"It's such a fine line between stupid and clever.\"Happily for us, director Reiner, who developed the underlying story line with Guest and former Credibility Gap pranksters McKean and Shearer, stays squarely on the right side of the line, even as his writer-actors remain hilariously trapped on the other side. In lieu of a formal shooting script, the quartet created an extensive and detailed band history ripe with the sort of dead-pan detail that hard-core rock historians and screwball aficionados will savor on countless replays; with the three Tap members also musicians themselves, the \"band\" developed its stage act under the unsuspecting noses of L.A. club denizens, who accepted them as just as loud, flashy, sexist, and obvious as any other mullet-tressed, leather-garbed brigade of guitar slingers, circa 1984. The resulting footage thus manages to lob its punch lines and build its characters (including some thinly veiled character assassinations of various industry folks) with a loose, tossed-away verve rooted in the improvisational approach.This Is Spinal Tapremains the funniest, and most truthful, look at rock culture ever filmed and a personal best for all involved.--Sam Sutherland", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 99031}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "This Is Spinal Tap (The Criterion Collection)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000ALFVD", "B00005ALS0", "B00005LC5D", "B000M341Q4", "B00005O3VC", "B000A7DVR2", "B00006HAWL", "B000VE439Y", "B00AEFXDO6", "B0000A02TZ", "B002RVZV9K", "B003CRM6PA", "B00004WGVQ", "B0009298N4", "B000A2UBNE", "B0009UC810", "B000LP6KNU", "B00006LPGP", "B00029RTCG", "B000055Y0X", "B0006GANPA", "B00003CXZ4", "B000MMMT9G", "B002DLB1IO", "B00006D295", "B00AEFYVMO", "B00007AJF8", "B00000ILDD", "B00003CXC3", "B00005A06N", "B0009IOR5M", "B0001Z4OXS", "B0000640VJ", "B004ALIG4M", "B000PAAJZ6", "B00005O06J", "B004L9GMBC", "B002HMHSJ0", "1559408677", "B0010YSD8Q", "B00AEFYR3C", "0780618564", "0767833988", "B004P9UWM8", "B003ELKNH2", "B000ROALGW", "B000HT3QBO", "B00000F3CD", "B0008JIJ2O", "B00005K3NU", "B000Z8GZYW", "B0024EWP6W", "B00008J2HC", "0780020707", "B001ECDVKE", "B000XJD33O", "B000CNESU8", "B000RJO578", "B000EGEJIY", "B000ZM1MG4", "0780622561", "B00BQTLVWK", "B00004ZBVO", "B00005B6JZ", "B000G6BLWE", "B0013K1ALE", "B0007UC8Y4", "B003XURDAY", "B0006GAOJA", "B00278FSXM", "0767827724", "B001IHJ988", "0783229526", "B000OHZKJA", "B001WLMOL4", "B000AP04L0", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00003CXGA", "B003YDORO0", "B00004YZFR", "B003O7I6SE", "6305161879", "B00AEBB9DM", "0783241895", "B00009OWJY", "B00005V0XF", "B000A2UBN4", "B002WJHBEU", "6304907729", "0783230338", "B0019UGYK0", "B000H7JCFK", "B000E33W1W", "B000069HZU", "B00H3JHH6Q", "B00AEFXJS6", "B00005JNZU", "B000067IZ3", "B00AEFXE9U", "B0009ZE9VW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005ALS0", "B0000ALFVD", "B000M341Q4", "B0018CMJSU"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71HEEMJV31L._SY300_.gif", "asin": "1559408758"}

{"description": "Director Richard Lester strikes the perfect balance between slapstick and swashbuckling swordplay in this whimsical adaptation of Alexandre Dumas's grand adventure. Michael York, all innocence and wide-eyed chivalry as young D'Artagnan, makes quite an impression on his first day in Paris: he challenges all three of the legendary Musketeers to a duel, then joins them in arms against the cardinal's soldiers. The worldly rascals, led by Athos (Oliver Reed), who hides his brooding past behind a sarcastic wit, adopt the young hero. Soon D'Artagnan is stealing hearts and stealing food with equal aplomb as he joins their campaign to defend the queen (Geraldine Chaplin) against a plot devised by the scheming cardinal (Charlton Heston) and his cold-hearted accomplice Milady de Winter (Faye Dunaway). Richard Chamberlain's Aramis, the trio's Don Juan and resident man of God, and Frank Finlay's fun-loving hedonist Porthos round out the Musketeers, while Christopher Lee's sneering Rochefort executes the cardinal's wishes as commander of the church's soldiers. Other members of this talented cast include Raquel Welch as the beautiful but disaster-prone seamstress to the queen, Spike Milligan as the beauty's jealous husband, Roy Kinnear as D'Artagnan's bumbling servant, Planchet, and Jean-Pierre Cassel as the clueless king. George MacDonald Fraser's rollicking screenplay combines boisterous adventure and roguish humor with marvelous characters, and Lester's dynamic direction turns it into one of the greatest comic swashbucklers of all time.

{"description": "The debut film of director Joel Coen and his brother-producer Ethan Coen, 1983'sBlood Simpleis grisly comic noir that marries the feverish toughness of pulp thrillers with the ghoulishness of even pulpier horror.

Emmett Walsh) to follow his cheating wife (Frances McDormand in her first film appearance), and then kill her and her lover (John Getz). The gumshoe turns the tables on his client, and suddenly a bad situation gets much, much worse, with some violent goings-on that are as elemental as they are shocking. (A scene in which a character who has been buried alive suddenly emerges from his own grave instantly becomes an archetypal nightmare.) Shot by Barry Sonnenfeld before he became an A-list director in Hollywood,Blood Simpleestablished the hyperreal look and feel of the Coens' productions (undoubtedly inspired a bit by filmmaker Sam Raimi, whoseThe Evil Deadhad just been coedited by Joel). Sections of the film have proved to be an endurance test for art-house movie fans, particularly an extended climax that involves one shock after another but ends with a laugh at the absurdity of criminal ambition.

{"description": "This minor 1955 work by Alfred Hitchcock, one of the lighter entries of his creative peak in the 1950s, is still imbued with the master's stock themes of shared guilt and romantic ambivalence. It is also hardly lacking in Hitchcockian cinematic inventiveness, such as a famous, often-imitated sequence in which some smooching between stars Cary Grant and Grace Kelly is intercut with a fireworks show that just happens to be going on outside in a Riviera setting. Grant plays a reformed cat burglar who is suspected of reviving his trade, though he knows someone else is using his old methods. A very enjoyable experience, but don't get this confused with Hitchcock's other Cary Grant film of that decade, which was a masterpiece:North by Northwest.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790743213", "6300183513", "0783221347", "0783235593", "B0000040EO", "6304039530", "6300181529", "6302227127", "6300215717", "079284517X", "6305123616", "0782006779", "6301798503", "0792839846", "6304457383", "6300183580", "630233683X", "0782006809", "0780614097", "6302484448", "6300215628", "6301670140", "0793910323", "6301586026", "630299005X", "6302413435", "6303102441", "6301670159", "0783235607", "6300215733", "0792837649", "6300181472", "630266232X", "6304117752", "0783235615", "6300215512", "6304383827", "6300158438", "B000059HH1", "0800100832", "6300215644", "0782008348", "6300215962", "6300216500", "0792837614", "B00004TRD5", "B000056BRF", "B000055Y0Y", "B00005ALP2", "6305718792", "6301964012", "6302363268", "B0045HCJ9E", "6300214028", "6304359705", "0792107683", "0783236352", "6304259131", "6302636779", "1558807780", "B000006N70", "6301734734", "B00004RFFA", "6301978315", "6301647734", "630018157X", "B00000I1EM", "6302909023", "6300215660", "6300213676", "6303631851", "B000EO7AIC", "6303082866", "630442972X", "6300181405", "6302700949", "0792845684", "6300215814", "6303364772", "B000021Y6K", "6302800897", "B00004RV8M", "6302800420", "6300214699", "6300216721", "6301797957", "6301965701", "6305122725", "0783226152", "B000BWIZRW", "0790733935", "6305012792", "6303908306", "6302098424", "6301045750", "6302278929", "6303192254", "6303562248", "6302736951"], "bought_together": ["0790743213", "6300183513"], "also_viewed": ["6304117752"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 239511}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.98, "brand": "", "asin": "6300215741", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C7XND430L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "To Catch a Thief [VHS]"}

{"description": "Francis Ford Coppola took some of the deep background from the life of Mafia chief Vito Corleone--the patriarch of Mario Puzo's bestselling novelThe Godfather--and built around it a stunning sequel to his Oscar-winning, 1972 hit film. Robert De Niro plays Vito as a young Sicilian immigrant in turn-of-the-century New York City's Little Italy. Coppola weaves in and out of the story of Vito's transformation into a powerful crime figure, contrasting that evolution against efforts by son Michael Corleone to spread the family's business into pre-Castro Cuba. As memorable as the first film is,The Godfather IIis an amazingly intricate, symmetrical tragedy that touches upon several chapters of 20th-century history and makes a strong case that our destinies are written long before we're born. This was De Niro's first introduction to a lot of filmgoers, and he makes an enormous impression. But even with him and a number of truly brilliant actors (including maestro Lee Strasberg), this is ultimately Pacino's film and a masterful performance.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000003KHS", "6302158176", "6300183211", "B0019L21H4", "6300214826", "6303686796", "6303168507", "0782008348", "6303471501", "0790705141", "0790733927", "6303402070", "B00003CXE6", "B000056BRF", "6300267997", "6300181340", "B0001VL30O", "6301977815", "6305363668", "0800132009", "6304508611", "B00005B238", "6300182878", "0792845684", "6302226899", "B00005Q4GZ", "0800100832", "6304429274", "B0000A36J1"], "bought_together": ["B000003KHS", "6302158176"], "also_viewed": ["B000NTPDSW", "B0019L770A", "B000003KHS", "6302158176", "6302610702", "6300183211", "0792174909", "B00EN09FKO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 228315}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.9, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "630021639X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41807N7YNFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Godfather, Part II [VHS]"}

{"description": "Bruce Lee wrote and directedReturn of the Dragon, his third film, a mix of hard-edged kung fu and goofy humor. Once again he plays the country boy who travels to a foreign land, in this case Italy, where his restaurant-owning cousins face trouble from the local syndicate. Their strong-arm tactics have driven customers away and now threaten the family, but Lee refuses to buckle under their pressure and takes them on in a series of impressive confrontations. The film ends with a memorable showdown with world-champion karate artist Chuck Norris in the Roman Colosseum (though much of it is staged in a rather cheap studio set), a brutal, almost inhuman battle that revels in the intense punishment taken by the combatants. Norris is one of Lee's best opponents and a marvelous physical contrast: brawny and hairy, using power and blunt karate moves while lean, wiry Lee counters with speed, gymnastic prowess, and balletic grace. The mix of comedy and kung fu comes off as camp at times, but that's hardly the reason to see the film. When Lee gets into action, whether he's taking on a gang of knife-wielding thugs or dueling Norris to the death, he becomes the total focus. Originally titledThe Way of the Dragon, this film was renamed in the wake ofEnter the Dragonto cash in on that movie's popularity.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"bought_together": ["0790735172", "6300250172"], "also_viewed": ["B004GJYRKA", "0790735172", "6300250172", "B00005OSN6", "B0041OJPIE", "6305508534", "B0015RCUR8", "B00005B1X4", "6300250156"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 385344}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.69, "brand": "", "asin": "6300250164", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YJKTD7HBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Return of the Dragon [VHS]"}

Having discovered that his presumed-dead mother (Oscar&reg;winner Jo Van Fleet) is a brothel owner in nearby Salinas, Cal convinces her to finance an investment that will restore his father's lost fortune, but neither money nor the tenderness of his brother's fianc&eacute;e (Julie Harris) can assuage Cal's anguished need for paternal acceptance that comes nearly too late.

{"description": "America's pastime gets a Faustian twist in this 1958 studio musical, which recounts the ballpark bargain struck by an aging Washington Senators fan obsessed with helping his team trump the Yanks. With echoes of the real-life 1919 Shoeless Joe Jackson scandal, and tart observations on the tradeoffs between youth and experience,Damn Yankeesfuses a classic dramatic dilemma with musical comedy to often charming effect.In transferring George Abbott's Broadway hit to the screen, codirectors Abbott and Stanley Donen are smart enough to retain Richard Adler and Jerry Ross's clever songs, Bob Fosse's sizzling choreography (with Fosse himself on camera for the sultry mambo number), and stars Ray Walston and Gwen Verdon, reprising their devilish turns as the Horned One himself, Mr. Applegate, and his temptress, Lola. Where the team strikes out, unfortunately, is in their concession to marquee politics, handing the pivotal role of Joe Hardy to handsome, vapid, celluloid heartthrob Tab Hunter, whose thin voice and unsteady screen presence argue that he should have stayed in the dugout.Walston is reliably spry and acerbic as the canny archangel, and Verdon, in one of her rare starring screen turns, confirms the comedic timing and sexy, muscular grace that made her a deserved draw in subsequent stage hits including another Fosse triumph,Sweet Charity. With her combination of feline grace and alternately steely, flirtatious femininity, Verdon makes you believe her when she sings, \"Whatever Lola wants, Lola gets.\"--Sam Sutherland", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 84201}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Damn Yankees [VHS]", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001MBTSTA", "B00007J5VN", "B00AATV0WS", "0790741091", "B001GUYAZY", "B0000024WT"], "also_viewed": ["B001PO550A", "B001MBTSTA", "B000LW7Z4G", "B004VWXUD2", "B00007J5VN", "B000002W65"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21SHB9Z55SL.jpg", "asin": "6301609638"}

{"description": "Part mystery, part wartime polemic,Lifeboatfinds director Alfred Hitchcock tackling a cinematic challenge that foreshadows the self-imposed handicaps ofRopeandRear Window. As with those subsequent features, Hitchcock confines his action and characters to a single set, in this instance the lone surviving lifeboat from an Allied freighter sunk by a German U-boat in the North Atlantic. A less confident, ingenious filmmaker might have opened up John Steinbeck's dialogue-driven character study beyond the battered boat and its cargo of survivors, but Hitchcock instead revels in his predicament to exploit the enforced intimacy between his characters.Indeed, we never actually see the doomed freighter--the smoking ship's funnel beneath the credits simply sinks beneath the waves, and we're plunged into the escalating tensions between those who gradually find their way to the boat, a band of eight English and American passengers and crew, plus a German sailor (Walter Slezak) rescued from the U-boat, itself destroyed by the freighter's deck gun. Heading the cast and inevitably commanding their and our attention is the cello-voiced Tallulah Bankhead as Connie Porter, a cynical, sophisticated writer whose priorities seem to be hanging onto her mink and keeping her lipstick fresh. Gradually, the others find Porter and her lifeboat, forming a temporary community that inevitably suggests a careful cross section of archetypes, from wealthy industrialist (Henry Hull) to ship's boiler men (John Hodiak and William Bendix).Hitchcock juggles the interpersonal skirmishes between the boat's occupants with the mystery of their German prisoner, which itself becomes a meditation on the fine line between nationalism and morality, a line that Slezak walks delicately until his identity is resolved. Visually, Hitchcock transforms his back-lot set and its rear-projected cloudbanks into a desolate stretch of ocean, while capturing the horror of an amputation through an economical set of images culminating in an empty boot.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0045HCJ9E", "6302413435", "0783236352", "B002GSXKQA", "0790743159", "1558807780", "6301800974", "0783235623", "0769403468", "6301640667", "6301975987", "6301973232", "1558808590", "630150528X", "0800100832", "6301564456", "6302226899", "6301959728", "B000EVD38G", "B00004R67T", "6302909023", "B00005Q4GY", "6304457316", "0790743213", "6300246965", "6301798503", "6302360978", "0783221347", "6301797957", "6301973410", "6300183580", "6304196954", "6301798708", "B000056BRF", "6302842263", "6304359705", "0792108280", "079074886X"], "also_viewed": ["B001D8W7F4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 319371}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6301798732", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AC1NXHYzL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lifeboat (The Hitchcock Collection) [VHS]"}

No collection of silent films is complete without this landmark, awe-inspiring epic, which really does boast a cast of thousands (the most memorable of which is Constance Talmadge as the spunky Mountain Girl). The fall of Babylon ranks with one of the great action set pieces, complete with racing chariots, a nifty decapitation (at the hands of Elmo Lincoln, the man who would be Tarzan), and falls from what appear to be incredible heights. The edge-of-your-seat climax to the modern story, a race against time to save an innocent young man from the electric chair, is another bravura sequence.--Donald Liebenson", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 491209}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Intolerance [VHS]", "related": {"also_viewed": ["6304383177", "B00008EY9D", "0312174918", "B007H7OQW2", "6301937112", "630197350X", "B00005J75F"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21W4KJXAYRL.jpg", "asin": "6301826558"}

{"description": "In the entire history of American movies,The Night of the Hunterstands out as the rarest and most exotic of specimens. It is, to say the least, a masterpiece--and not just because it was the only movie directed by flamboyant actor Charles Laughton or the only produced solo screenplay by the legendary critic James Agee (who also cowroteThe African Queen). The truth is, nobody has ever made anything approaching its phantasmagoric, overheated style in which German expressionism, religious hysteria, fairy-tale fantasy (of the Grimm-est variety), and stalker movie are brought together in a furious boil. Like a nightmarish premonition of stalker movies to come,Night of the Huntertells the suspenseful tale of a demented preacher (Robert Mitchum, in a performance that prefigures his memorable villain inCape Fear), who torments a boy and his little sister--even marries their mixed-up mother (Shelley Winters)--because he's certain the kids know where their late bank-robber father hid a stash of stolen money. So dramatic, primal, and unforgettable are its images--the preacher's shadow looming over the children in their bedroom, the magical boat ride down a river whose banks teem with fantastic wildlife, those tattoos of LOVE and HATE on the unholy man's knuckles, the golden locks of a drowned woman waving in the current along with the indigenous plant life in her watery grave--that they're still haunting audiences (and filmmakers) today.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["1558808590", "6301976126", "0784011451", "0792101448", "6304212151", "1558807780", "B000003NDA", "6301966430", "6301491920", "B00000F6MH", "6304366035", "6302226899", "0790743159", "6302413435", "6301586026", "0790741431", "6300208133", "6304429274", "0783217528", "6301797906", "6301798732", "0800100832", "B000GX7MMA", "B000054OW2", "6301977815", "B000056BRF", "B0000048YO", "B001E419N8", "630266232X", "6301978110", "6302968100", "6305237115", "6301564456", "0782008348", "0792115449", "6302353785", "6301964012", "630150528X"], "bought_together": ["1558808590"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 201324}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6301973232", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/717SP3TYNML._SY300_.gif", "title": "Night of the Hunter [VHS]"}

{"description": "Sidney Lumet's directorial debut remains a tense, atmospheric (though slightly manipulative and stagy) courtroom thriller, in which the viewer never sees a trial and the only action is verbal. As he does in his later corruption commentaries such asSerpicoorQ & A, Lumet focuses on the lonely one-man battles of a protagonist whose ethics alienate him from the rest of jaded society. As the film opens, the seemingly open-and-shut trial of a young Puerto Rican accused of murdering his father with a knife has just concluded and the 12-man jury retires to their microscopic, sweltering quarters to decide the verdict. When the votes are counted, 11 men rule guilty, while one--played by Henry Fonda, again typecast as another liberal, truth-seeking hero--doubts the obvious.

{"description": "The Russian answer to2001, and very nearly as memorable a movie. The legendary Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky made this extremely deliberate science-fiction epic, an adaptation of a novel by Stanislaw Lem. The story follows a cosmonaut (Donatas Banionis) on an eerie trip to a planet where haunting memories can take physical form. Its bare outline makes it sound like a routine space-flight picture, an elongatedTwilight Zoneepisode; but the further into its mysteries we travel, the less familiar anything seems. Even though Tarkovsky's meanings and methods are sometimes mystifying,Solarishas a way of crawling inside your head, especially given the slow pace and general lack of forward momentum. By the time the final images cross the screen, Tarkovsky has gone way beyond SF conventions into a moving, unsettling vision of memory and home. Well worthy of cult status,Solarisis both challenging art-house fare and a whacked-out head trip.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302719666", "630154028X", "6300184064"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 416101}, "asin": "630212042X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519BV1ZP83L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Solaris [VHS]"}

{"description": "Like moths to a flame, great actors gravitate to the singular genius of playwright-screenwriter David Mamet, who updated his Pulitzer Prize-winning play for this all-star screen adaptation. The material is not inherently cinematic, so the movie's greatest asset is Mamet's peerless dialogue and the assembly of a once-in-a-lifetime cast led by Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, and Alec Baldwin (the last in a role Mamet created especially for the film). Often regarded as a critique of the Reagan administration's impact on the American economy, the play and film focus on a competitive group of real estate salesmen who've gone from feast to famine in a market gone cold. When an executive \"motivator\" (Alec Baldwin) demands a sales contest among the agents in the cramped office, the stakes are critically high: any agent who fails to meet his quota of sales \"leads\" (i.e., potential buyers) will lose his job. This intense ultimatum is a boon for the office superstar (Pacino), but a once-successful salesman (Lemmon) now finds himself clinging nervously to faded glory. Political and personal rivalries erupt under pressure when the other agents (Alan Arkin, Ed Harris) suspect the office manager (Kevin Spacey) of foul play. This cauldron of anxiety, tension, and sheer desperation provides fertile soil for Mamet's scathingly rich dialogue, which is like rocket fuel for some of the greatest actors of our time. Pacino won an Oscar nomination for his volatile performance, but it's Lemmon who's the standout, doing some of the best work of his distinguished career. Director James Foley shapes Mamet's play into a stylish, intensely focused film that will stand for decades as a testament to its brilliant writer and cast.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303515223", "1558807780"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 369412}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.3, "brand": "", "asin": "6302732875", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51S2V1ZW1GL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Glengarry Glen Ross [VHS]"}

{"description": "An elderly college professor sets out in his car to receive an honorary degree--and takes a trip instead through his own past and subconscious--in this bittersweet but ultimately tender and understanding 1957 film by Swedish master Ingmar Bergman. Casting Swedish star Victor Sj&ouml;str&ouml;m in the lead, Bergman, then at the height of his powers as an international filmmaker, uses flashbacks and bright, lyrical storytelling to capture the full arc of one man's life: the successes that seem fleeting, the disappointments that linger in the memory, the regrets that never seem to let go. In some ways, it can be seen as a forerunner of Woody Allen'sDeconstructing Harry, except that Bergman's sense of irony is always more profound.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303107338", "6303107346", "6300150151", "6304209584", "6302798248", "B00000J2L7", "6302783348", "6303261418", "630526323X", "B000007NTY", "6302641888", "630264187X", "6302919509", "B00005ATQA", "6303107354"], "bought_together": ["6303107346", "6303107338"], "also_viewed": ["6303107346", "6303107338", "6303107354"]}, "price": 15.57, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 390240}, "asin": "6302783356", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F5X2EAK1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wild Strawberries [VHS]"}

{"description": "Seven decades before Michael Crichton borrowed the title of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic adventure tale,The Lost Worldwas the movie sensation of 1925. (The film is not to be confused with Steven Spielberg's sequel toJurassic Park.) Just as Spielberg's dinosaur thrillers would advance the technology of computer-generated spectacle, Doyle's classic story provided a perfect opportunity to exploit the illusions made possible by stop-motion animation. Eight years before he stunned audiences with the amazing special effects ofKing Kong, pioneering stop-motion animator Willis O'Brien created the dinosaur stars of this classic silent-film fantasy. Following Doyle's plot, the film plays like a dress rehearsal forKing Kongand establishes a now-familiar scenario: Wallace Beery plays a visionary scientist who returns to the remote South African plateau where he'd earlier discovered a jungle haven of prehistoric creatures.  Determined to introduce this discovery to the world, he returns to London with a captive brontosaurus, which later escapes and goes on a destructive rampage through the city.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["630497342X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 617027}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6303038786", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/214HP8TDKRL.jpg", "title": "Lost World [VHS]"}
{"description": "This 1970 Billy Wilder comedy-drama about a major defeat in the career of Sherlock Holmes may have little to do with the legacy of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, but in its uncut form it happens to be one of the finest films of the decade. Robert Stephens makes a perfectly splendid Holmes, brilliant, sophisticated, and deeply flawed, while Colin Blakely plays Dr. Watson as a drinker and ladies' man with more personality and intelligence than is often granted him by filmmakers. The case (which has some echoes of Doyle's story \"The Bruce-Partington Plans\") begins with Holmes aiding the distressed Madame Valladon (Genevi&egrave;ve Page), who is searching for her missing husband. The inquiry shifts to Scotland, and despite a stern warning from the hero's brother, Mycroft Holmes (Christopher Lee), Sherlock pursues events that reveal a top-secret government plan. Lush, energetic, funny, gorgeous to look at, and ultimately tragic, the film is layered with Wilder's familiar collision of cynicism and yearning, hope and betrayal, grace and isolation.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302989590"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 450050}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.55, "brand": "", "asin": "6303091989", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514P4M6PP7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Private Life of Sherlock Holmes [VHS]"}
{"description": "You may be surprised to discover that the director of theLethal Weaponmovies and scary horror flickThe Omen, Richard Donner, also produced and directed this classic children's adventure (which, by the way, was written by Donner's screen-wizard friend Steven Spielberg). Then again you may not.The Goonies, like Donner's other movies, is the same story of good versus evil. It has its share of bad guys (the Fratelli brothers and their villainous mother), reluctant-hero good guys (the Walsh bothers and their gang of friends), and lots of corny one-liners. Like in an old-fashioned Hardy Boys or Nancy Drew plot, the Goonies need to solve a problem: a corrupt corporate developer has bought out their neighborhood and plans to flatten all their homes. Luckily, the beloved gang stumbles on a treasure map. In the hopes of finding the treasure to buy back their houses, the Goonies embark on their quest through underground passages, aboard pirate ships, and behind waterfalls. This swashbuckling and rollicking ride was also a great breeding ground for a couple of child actors who went on to enjoy numerous successes in adulthood: Sean Astin (Rudy,Encino Man) and Martha Plimpton (Pecker,200 Cigarettes).--Samantha Allen Storey", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790700506", "6303506291", "6303212395", "6300263681", "0790742322", "0767825411", "6301871952", "B00005B238", "6301792734", "B00005PJ8I", "6303257844", "630157401X", "B00000JGEK", "6304143184", "6300214060", "6302945127", "6301179552", "B00004TWZK", "B00000JGEI", "6304718551", "0783216084", "B00000JPH5", "630339406X", "6301163796", "6302968143", "B00006AL1C", "6304466498", "0788802194", "0783229011", "6304978286", "6302798450", "B00016JF2W", "B002NZK5SW", "6302642256", "6300248089", "0800125762", "0790724960", "6304509154", "6301666569", "6302705517", "6301569385", "6301578805", "6300989003", "B00008DDXB", "6302815673", "B00000JPH4", "630596260X", "6302961661", "B000AQE9WY", "6303486754", "6301744136", "6305576173", "0800196767", "6300183467", "0800125789", "B0002TT0NM", "B0000048S1", "0790732580", "6303212263", "0784011923", "6300184269", "6300271285", "6304169558", "B00005LIRF", "6300214710", "B00004U8P4", "6300182878", "B0007A2GSM", "630309239X", "6302877881", "6304340648", "B00008X5J8", "0767821912", "6303140157", "6303442447", "6303454089", "6302409365", "B00003CXI0", "B000035Z46", "B00005JLR1", "6303929583"], "bought_together": ["0790700506", "0790742322"], "also_viewed": ["0790742322", "6303506291", "0767825411", "155890641X", "6303212395", "6302091632", "0790700506", "6300183211", "6302814782", "B00005LL26", "B00004TWZK", "B00028HBES", "6304718551", "0790731436", "B00000JKNP", "6300214710", "B000005PFL", "6300270033", "6305428050", "6303224407", "630339406X", "B000035Z2S", "6304117752", "B00003CXIP", "B00003CXQX", "6303148352", "0783216084", "B00005JNQS", "6305326940", "6300263673", "6301792734", "B00080ZFZC", "6304400551", "0790748266", "B00004TJTQ", "0790719029", "6304434340", "B00003CXI0", "6303241123", "6303314015", "B000067FP8", "B00005JKDQ", "B006VRRGNK", "B000C3L27U", "B00000JPH5", "6303953425", "6302765536", "B004Z7AHZC", "B009Z5975A", "B00081912E", "1560395737", "B00001IVED", "6304089767", "B003KV3E3G", "B0052OPJ1E", "B00447L4JG", "B0007KTBIU", "6302914469", "B001BA9FIG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 66611}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.93, "brand": "", "asin": "6303212379", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512FAC93Y7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]"}
{"description": "Alec Guinness, best known for the serious dramatic roles and authoritative presence of his later films, made his mark early as a versatile character actor and a gifted comic performer. These talents are shown to their best in this bewitchingly black-hearted 1949 comedy of a poor cousin murdering his way up the inheritance ladder of a titled, old-money family. Guinness, in only his third film, becomes practically the entire family tree, starring in no less than eight hilarious roles. Handsome Dennis Price is the scheming relative, the progeny of an unfortunate marriage that turned his mother into a family pariah. Determined to earn the title he believes is rightfully his, he ingratiates himself back into the family and plots his ascension through a succession of Guinness-created social dinosaurs, joyfully killing off his kin in a series of inventive assassinations. It's class warfare in action, and Price is winning the war. The delectable Joan Greenwood costars as the married object of Price's affections, whose own venomous nature becomes apparent when Price falls for Valerie Hobson, the cultured widow of one of his victims. Robert Hamer directs with a light touch and dry wit, marrying the understated Ealing Studios comic style with the dark, satirical edge of John Dighton's sharp screenplay.

{"description": "Before Kevin Smith became a Hollywood darling withChasing Amy, a film he wrote and directed, he made this $27,000 comedy about real-life experiences working for chump change at a New Jersey convenience store. A rude, foul-mouthed collection of anecdotes about the responsibilities that go with being on the wrong side of the till, the film is also a relationship story that takes some hilarious turns once the lovers start revealing their sexual histories to one another. In the best tradition of first-time, ultra-low budget independent films, Smith usesClerksas an audition piece, demonstrating that he not only can handle two-character comedy but also has an eye for action--as proven in a smoothly handled rooftop hockey scene. Smith himself appears as a silent figure who hangs out on the fringes of the store's property.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303964745", "B00005UQEY", "6305812330", "B0002I83YU", "6305958181"], "bought_together": ["B00005UQEY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 314053}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.13, "brand": "", "asin": "6303430570", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71XBDZMG33L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Clerks [VHS]"}

{"description": "James Bond's fourth adventure takes him to the Bahamas, where a NATO warplane with a nuclear payload has disappeared into the sea. Bond (Sean Connery) travels from a tony health spa (where he tangles with a mechanized masseuse run amuck) to the casinos of Nassau and soon picks up the trail of SPECTRE's number-two man, Emilio Largo (Adolfo Celi), and his beautiful mistress, Domino (Claudine Auger), whom Bond soon seduces to his side. Equipped with more gadgets than ever, courtesy of the resourceful \"Q\" (Desmond Llewelyn), agent 007 escapes an ambush with a personal-size jet pack and takes to the water as he searches for the undersea plane, battles Largo's pet sharks, and finally leads the battle against Largo's scuba-equipped henchmen in a spectacular underwater climax. This thrilling Bond entry became Connery's most successful outing in the series and was remade in 1983 asNever Say Never Again, with Connery returning to the role after a 12-year hiatus.

{"description": "Russian filmmaker Nikita Mikhalkov is also the star of this tragic 1994 drama about the last happy season in the life of a Bolshevik hero's family. The year is 1936, and Stalin's purges are in full swing. Despite his reputation and revolutionary record, Sergei Kotov (Mikhalkov) seems to be on the dictator's hit list, as indicated by the insulting arrival of his wife's former lover, an agent of government police. Mikhalkov treats all this as a matter of personal and political intrigue dropping like rotting fruit in the middle of a sunny and loving period for the Kotov clan. The director ingeniously understates the mounting threat until one begins to realize that the Kotovs are only geographically distant from the long, bloody reach of Stalin. By the time we do realize it, the shock of change is almost unbearable. A very fine movie all around, though Mikhalkov's touches of magic realism (particularly the presence of a golden orb that keeps popping into the action) are distracting and a subject of controversy among viewers.--Tom Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 392506}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.89, "brand": "", "asin": "630386905X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H17JCXFCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Burnt By the Sun [VHS]"}
{"description": "Ever since this convoluted thriller dazzled audiences and critics in 1995 and won an Oscar for Christopher McQuarrie's twisting screenplay,The Usual Suspectshas continued to divide movie lovers into opposite camps. While a lot of people take great pleasure from the movie's now-famous central mystery (namely, \"Who is Keyser S&ouml;ze?\"), others aren't so easily impressed by a movie that's too enamored of its own cleverness to make much sense. After all, what are we to make of a final scene that renders the entire movie obsolete? Half the fun ofThe Usual Suspectsis the debate it provokes and the sheer pleasure of watching its dynamic cast in action, led (or should we say, mislead) by Oscar-winner Kevin Spacey as the club-footed con man who recounts the saga of enigmatic Hungarian mobster Keyser S&ouml;ze. Spacey's in a band of thieves that includes Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Pollak, and Benicio Del Toro, all gathered in a plot to steal a large shipment of cocaine. The story is told in flashback as a twisted plot being described by Spacey's character to an investigating detective (Chazz Palmintieri), andThe Usual Suspectsis enjoyable for the way it keeps the viewer guessing right up to its surprise ending. Whether that ending will enhance or extinguish the pleasure is up to each viewer to decide. Even if it ultimately makes little or no sense at all, this is a funny and fiendish thriller, guaranteed to entertain even its vocal detractors.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0800125762", "0800125789", "6302935148", "0783222955", "B00005QATY", "B00003CWL5", "6304259131", "6300215741"], "also_viewed": ["6304140851"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 469637}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6303908306", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z2K7HPEJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Usual Suspects, Letterbox Edition  [VHS]"}
{"description": "Ingmar Bergman'sScenes from a Marriageopens with a couple--Marianne (Liv Ullmann) and Johan (Erland Josephson)--being interviewed for a magazine. Every moment seems to teeter on the brink of some rupture; just as they start to get comfortable, the interviewer has them freeze for a photograph. After making some bland general statements, they both start admitting intimate details, confessing that they were brought together by mutual misery, then cheerfully claiming that theirs is a model marriage. The entirety ofScenes from a Marriage, which chronicles their emotional relationship even after their divorce and marriages to other people, continues to have these contradictory moments of honesty and self-deception, cruelty and kindness, concern and self-obsession--all laid bare by the skillful actors and the subtle, constantly shifting screenplay. Every scene is a small movie unto itself; in fact,Scenes from a Marriagewas originally a six-episode TV show, which was carefully edited down into a unified film. This  is one of Bergman's most immediate and accessible works, concerned more with the facts of human behavior than symbolism or abstract themes. Bergman understands how to balance what could be horrible pain and despair with the characters' earnest efforts to improve their lives. His imitators reduce everything to sheer suffering and alienation; Bergman sees the best in his characters, even when their actions are terrible. This 1973 film won numerous awards, including several acting honors for Ullmann.--Bret  Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304209584", "6302783348"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 360686}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 28.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6303968635", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VZZ3XCNSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Scenes From a Marriage [VHS]"}
{"description": "This superbly acted, mordantly funny romp through 70&nbsp;years or so of Roman history is one of the best-loved miniseries ever made, and deservedly so. Derek Jacobi plays Roman Emperor Claudius, who reflects in old age on his life and his remarkable family, giving us a history lesson that's unlike anything you learned in school.The story begins in 24&nbsp;B.C. during the reign of Augustus Caesar, Rome's  first emperor, and ends in A.D.&nbsp;54 with Nero on the throne. In between,I, Claudiusdetails the scheming, murder, madness, and lust that passed for politics in the early years of the Pax Romana. The biggest worm in the Roman apple is Augustus's wife, Livia (the superb Si&acirc;n Phillips), whose single-minded pursuit of power shapes the destiny of the Empire. With a carefully planted rumor here and a poisoned fig there, she gradually maneuvers her son, Tiberius, toward the throne, creating an atmosphere of suspicion and treachery that starts Rome on its helter-skelter slide into bloody chaos. Phillips somehow makes us understand this extraordinarily wicked woman. As she ages and her carefully wrought webs begin to unravel, it becomes clear that Livia has been as thoroughly poisoned by her own ambition as her victims were by her carefully prepared meals.Further acting honors go to George Baker as Tiberius, who resists but eventually succumbs to the destiny forced upon him by his mother, and to John Hurt as a hilarious and absolutely terrifying Caligula. In one breathtakingly tense scene, the mad Emperor performs a dance in drag, then asks Claudius to critique it, perfectly capturing the horror of a world where one wrong word means death, or worse. Jacobi is the perfect Claudius, hiding his intelligence behind a crippling stammer and shuffling around the edges of events--until he finds himself pulled to the very center. His wry comments give shape to the tangled story of his family and help the audience make sense of a dauntingly complex cast of characters.I, Claudiusmight seem a little studio-bound to viewers brought up on more recent big-budget costume dramas, but the topnotch cast and the incident-filled plot are more than enough to hold the attention through almost 11&nbsp;hours of gripping, deliciously wicked Roman follies. This boxed set also includes a documentary entitled \"The Epic That Never Was,\" about Alexander Korda's failed attempt to filmI, Claudiusin 1937. The film, directed by Josef von Sternberg and starring Charles Laughton as Claudius and Merle Oberon as Messalina, was abandoned unfinished, and it remains one of Hollywood's great lost movies.--Simon Leake", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302676185", "630354231X", "6302075270"], "also_viewed": ["B006JY3OHW", "6302075270"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 306411}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.93, "brand": "", "asin": "6303980813", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AV6N7YYFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "I, Claudius [VHS]"}

{"description": "Baste the turkeysaurus and head over to Bloomingshale's for some last-minute shopping; it's Christmastime in Bedrock. Fred and the gang have more than the usual festive preparations up their prehistoric sleeves, however, as they are staging a production of \"The Christmas Carol\" with Fred in the role of Scrooge. Things take a frightening turn when--in the classic tradition of method acting--Fred takes his role to heart and becomes a bit humbuggish himself. So preoccupied with his role is he, that he forgets to pick up Pebbles from day care, leaves Christmas shopping off his list of things to do, and belittles the parts played by his friends (such as Barney as Bob Cratchit). When the Bedrock bug (a flu virus) begins to fell cast members, it provides the ideal opportunity for costume maker and stage manager Wilma to take on understudy duties and scare some sense into her self-absorbed husband. And just in time for Christmas Eve. God bless them, every one.

{"description": "&quot;Do your parentsknowyou're Ramones?&quot; With those withering words, Miss Togar (Mary Woronov), the uptight neofascist principal of Vince Lombardi High School, addresses the four mop-haired, leather-jacketed members of America's first and most famous punk band. And you know it won't be long before the Ramones's jackhammer riffs are blaring through the public address system at maximum volume, the kids are running--not walking--wild in the hallways (without passes!), and Miss Togar's gulag is re-christened &quot;Rock 'n' Roll High School.&quot; Then, in keeping with the outrageously nihilistic animus of punk, the high school students and the Ramones just blow the place to smithereens. It's a crowd- pleasing, fantasy-fulfillment climax that combines the apocalyptic finale of Michelangelo Antonioni'sZabriskie Pointwith the explosive conclusion of Alice Cooper's &quot;School's Out.&quot;Rock 'n' Roll High Schoolis a blast, a goofy and liberating salute to the rebel spirit behind the teen rock & roll movies of the 1950s, which always pitted the kids' insatiable appetite for fun against the adults' fear-based authoritarianism. The film is emblematic of the disarmingly silly, tongue-in-cheek humor of the youth-oriented B-pictures cranked out in the '50s and '60s by renowned low-budget exploitation mogul Roger Corman (who gave many a hungry young filmmaker, including the creators of this film, their start in the biz), and of the noisy, anarchic energy of '70s punk rock, as personified by the inimitable Ramones.

{"description": "George Romero's 1978 follow-up to his classicNight of the Living Deadis quite terrifying and gory (those zombies do like the taste of living flesh). But in its own way, it is just as comically satiric as the first film in its take on contemporary values. This time, we follow the fortunes of four people who lock themselves inside a shopping mall to get away from the marauding dead and who then immerse themselves in unabashed consumerism, taking what they want from an array of clothing and jewelry shops, making gourmet meals, etc. It is Romero's take on Louis XVI in the modern world: keep the starving masses at bay and crank up the insulated indulgence. Still, this is a horror film when all is said and done, and even some of Romero's best visual jokes (a Hare Krishna turned blue-skinned zombie) can make you sweat.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304983794", "6305095566", "B00000JXVM", "B000068IEV", "6302517036", "6302921058", "6301969782", "0792839234", "B004HHX9OQ", "B0087ZG7UW", "6304819927", "B00023NRSM", "0792845684", "1564427803", "6300182878", "6300262855", "0783235607", "B00008EYBD", "B0000066X4", "630428845X", "6302968100", "6302088607", "0780627032", "6302036852"], "also_viewed": ["B002KAIW4E", "B00D7AM71A", "6304983794", "B001CW7ZW6", "B00000G1XV", "B00000JXVM", "B00000K3TO", "B00023NRSM", "B000FS9FE4", "6304819927", "B0025VLEMK", "B001CDLARQ", "630428845X", "B000AQ69UO", "B000RJO56O", "B000RIWAVW", "B005CM1IES", "6301969782", "B001CW7ZWG", "0780627032", "6303257879", "B00KTFJ50M", "6301961404", "B001YZU32A", "B0089N4G50", "B0009A40ES", "B00JHH1W9K", "B005J9ZE5I", "6300158411", "6304288433", "B0002ABUT8", "B00DEQQK8S", "0792836634", "630130053X", "6303265693", "6300214087", "6300189015", "B00005K3O4", "B002VWNIDG", "6302120101", "B001CW7ZVC", "B00AZ7V0W0", "B0040YFR1Y", "B000009NQY", "6302921058", "6305095566", "B000LPS4BG", "B00IF8Q0YE", "6300214192", "B00E5S2HGS", "B00KDU8HQQ"]}, "price": 34.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 326849}, "asin": "6304240554", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518MTSB8ACL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dawn of the Dead [VHS]"}

{"description": "Disney's 1959 animated effort was the studio's most ambitious to date, a widescreen spectacle boasting a gorgeous waltz-filled score adapting Tchaikovsky. In the 14th century, the malevolent Maleficent (not dissimilar to the wicked Queen in Disney'sSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs) taunts a king that his infant Aurora will fatally prick her finger on a spinning wheel before sundown on her 16th birthday. This, of course, would deny her a happily-ever-after with her true love. Things almost but not quite turn out that way, thanks to the assistance of some bubbly, bumbling fairies named Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather. It's not really all that much about the title character--how interesting can someone in the middle of a long nap be, anyway? Instead, those fairies carry the day, as well as, of course, good Prince Phillip, whose battle with the malevolent Maleficent in the guise of a dragon has been co-opted by any number of animated films since. See it in its original glory here. And Malificent's castle, filled with warthogs and demonic imps in a macabre dance celebrating their evil ways, manages a certain creepy grandeur.--David Kronke", "related": {"also_bought": ["155890641X", "0788802194", "0788812408", "6302526574", "0788806270", "0788812807", "078881172X", "6302642248", "6302787068", "6302320402", "6304500831", "6303314015", "6300274268", "B000035Z2S", "6300274195", "0788805843", "6305229449", "0788803743", "6302961572", "6302178924", "6304290888", "6303983812", "6300275310", "6305940932", "B0000AQZYM", "6304089767", "6305319138", "0788805533", "6304400551", "6304978286", "6304100507", "6302158095", "B00005JKDQ", "6305326940", "6304089201", "6303929338", "6304501153", "6303534422", "B00003CXQX", "6303036813", "B00005T7H6", "6301390725", "B00003CX7L", "6304873441", "B0000524CZ", "B00000ICHA", "B00004R99N", "6304400225", "B00004R99I", "B0009SUS4Q", "6302426200", "6300274608", "0788812440", "6303122647", "B0000E32WB", "0788811002", "0788810634", "B00000JS61", "B00005RDVV", "6303939015", "B00016JF2W", "B00005RDWC", "0790748266", "B000JBWWRO", "6304117752", "1558906150", "B00003CXHR", "B000035Z46", "6303486894", "0788812181", "6303392350", "B003H9M1Q2", "6303148387", "6302484359", "1558901892", "B00005JL95", "B00003CXQ6", "6301948106", "6305177473", "0788809806", "B00007AJLB", "B00003CWPW", "6305942285", "B000B8I8T6", "B00335EQ0E", "6301991311", "B0002YLCHE", "630460016X", "0788810448", "B00004REYY", "B003ZHVJGO", "B000063V8N", "078880720X", "B00004R99O", "B00005JKX3", "6300276554", "1558906630", "B000009CTR", "B00005RRG3"], "bought_together": ["155890641X", "0788802194"], "also_viewed": ["155890641X", "0788802194", "6302526574", "0788806270", "078881172X", "0788812408", "6300274268", "6302787068", "6304500831", "0788812807", "6302320402", "6303314015", "0788805843", "6302642248", "6302178924", "6302961572", "6305319138", "6303983812", "6300274195", "6305229449", "B000035Z2S", "6304089767", "B0000AQZYM", "6304978286", "0788805533", "6303929338", "6304290888", "6305940932", "6304400551", "6303534422", "6300275310", "6304100507", "6304089201", "6302158095", "B00005JKDQ", "B001DXF9FE", "B00003CXCQ", "B0007KTBIU", "6305326940", "B00004R99N", "6304501153", "6304400225", "6302426200", "6303036813", "B00003CXQX", "6300274608", "B0000E32WB", "B00003CXHR", "B00000ICHA", "0788811002", "B00005JL95", "B003ZHVJGO", "B00005RDVV", "B0000022WA", "0788812440", "1558906150", "B00003CX7L", "B0000524CZ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 50797}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.49, "brand": "Walt Disney Home Video", "asin": "6304401132", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y7WQST4JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sleeping Beauty (Fully Restored Limited Edition) (Walt Disney's Masterpiece)  [VHS]"}

{"description": "This science fiction blockbuster from 1990 began its production life as a very different movie than the one that was released. An adaptation of the Philip K. Dick short story &quot;We Can Remember It for You Wholesale,&quot;Total Recallwas originally conceived of with Richard Dreyfuss starring as a Walter Mitty-like character who experiences a variety of artificially induced fantasies. The movie we know is a mega-budget action epic set on Mars.  Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a normal working man who discovers that his entire reality has been invented to conceal a plot of planetary domination. Oscar-winning special effects and violent action propel the twisting plot, in which Arnold manipulates his manipulators in a world of dazzling high technology. Director Paul Verhoeven (Robocop) indulges his usual penchant for gratuitous bloodshed, but the movie has enough cleverness to rise above its excesses.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AKGG828", "B000RW3VCK", "B00005N5S5", "B000056PMU", "B000BPL2FQ", "B00026ZG10", "1558908846", "B0002J58HO", "B00005JA8B", "B001VLBDD0", "B002GHHHME", "B005LAII3A", "B0045HCJGC", "B0000VD12I", "6305767866", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B000FC2FQA", "B000RJO56E", "B001TK80C0", "0783225504", "B0001Z37HM", "B00004Y87O", "B00005N7Z1", "B00005JKIP", "B005COLETU", "0783241895", "B00013RC8E", "B00007AJG4", "0783226926", "B00AEFYDM2", "B001FB55HQ", "0800195175", "B003XURDAY", "B00004XMSC", "B000OVLBHG", "B00IZZDWKM", "B0045HCJ5S", "B000U1ZV8K", "B009YQJ322", "B0002CHK1S", "6304602944", "B00004STDN", "B002ZG98LO", "0783225946", "B0006GANOQ", "B0045HCJT4", "B00005JL78", "B000QUCQX8", "B00008G8LY", "B00005JMZK", "B001B3LIOC", "B0004Z33EG", "B00I9TDMRM", "B0002S94CK", "B000U1ZV62", "B00005JN0T", "B0045HCJG2", "B0000542CD", "B000U1ZV4Y", "B000E5N684", "B0000VCZK2", "B0000844I8", "B00008G8M4", "B004P7CN5O", "B0004Z33EQ", "B00006RCOC", "B000O77SRC", "6304806434", "B000RRS7RE", "B002ZG999U", "B00000G3PA", "B004P3HA8I", "B000QUCRB4", "B00003CWU3", "B00BLF9FOK", "B002VWNIDG", "B005LAIHXQ", "B00005JKFR", "B0009X768W", "B000GUJYQ0", "B000FI8MPW", "B0045HCJFS", "B001OST0M6", "B00AEBB99Q", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B000P0J0AQ", "6305258287", "B000NTMA0Q", "B00005JNTI", "B002VWNID6", "B00005JM5B", "B008JFUO36", "6304711891", "B000O77SRM", "B000QXDCLU", "B00008G8M5", "B00000ILDD", "B0000AOX0F", "0780622650", "B0007PALZ2"], "bought_together": ["B00026ZG10"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005LAII3A", "B00005JA8B", "B001JFZ118", "B001VLBDD0"]}, "price": 19.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 88004}, "asin": "6304490135", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51D88Q82WTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Total Recall"}

{"description": "At his best, director John Woo turns action movies into ballets of blood and bullets grounded in character drama.Face/Offmarks Woo's first American film to reach the pitched level of his best Hong Kong work (Hard-Boiled). He takes a patently absurd premise--hero and villain exchange identities by literally swapping faces in science-fiction plastic surgery--and creates a double-barreled revenge film driven by the split psyches of its newly redefined characters. FBI agent Sean Archer (John Travolta) must play the villain to move through the underworld while psychotic terrorist Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) becomes a perversely paternal family man while using every tool at his disposal to destroy his nemesis. Travolta vamps Cage's tics and flamboyant excess with the grace of a dancer after his transformation from cop to criminal, while Cage plays the sullen, bottled-up agent excruciatingly trapped behind the face of the man who killed his son. His attempts to live up to the terrorist's reputation become cathartic explosions of violence that both thrill and terrify him. This is merely icing on the cake for action fans, the dramatic backbone for some of the most visceral action thrills ever. Woo fills the screen with one show-stopping set piece after another, bringing a poetic grace to the action freakout with sweeping camerawork and sophisticated editing. This marriage of melodrama and mayhem ups the ante from cops-and-robbers clich&eacute;s to a conflict of near-mythic levels.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792116887", "0792133153", "0800125762", "B00006IUNT", "6304259131", "6304681496", "B00004WIDB", "079212569X", "6302816629", "6304258984", "B00005PJ8I", "B00003CXTF", "B000007OY0"], "bought_together": ["0792116887"], "also_viewed": ["6304259158"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 280197}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.39, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "6304618344", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71PMMMZ3CYL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Face/Off [VHS]"}

{"description": "Basil Fawlty, as created and performed by John Cleese, is the rudest, most boorish, most hilariously obnoxious man on the face of the planet. What a natural for a TV sitcom! His screen wife, Sybil (Prunella Scales), put it best in the episode \"The Psychiatrist\": \"You're either crawling all over them, licking their boots, or spitting poison at them like some Benzedrine puff adder.\" He mockingly replies, \"Just trying to enjoy myself, dear.\" With his gangly frame and contortionist abilities, Cleese brilliantly punctuates Basil's outrageous faux pas with absurd gymnastics and turns Three Stooges-style pokes and kicks into a slapstick ballet. Scales's Sybil is the genial but obliviously chatty voice of reason and Andrew Sachs mangles the English language as the Spanish bellhop Manuel, whose struggles with simple directions results in comic lunacy reminiscent of Robert Benigni. After a six-episode run in 1975, Cleese and cowriter and costar Connie Booth (who plays Polly, the maid all too often pulled into Basil's ridiculous plans) reunited the cast in 1979 for another six episodes without missing a punch line. The four-volume collection contains all 12 shows, interspersed with interview segments featuring Cleese discussing the genesis of the series and anecdotes about the individual episodes. Remember to watch the opening credits of each show to spot the creative misspellings on the hotel sign (my favorite: \"Fatty Owls\").--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303631991", "6302293553", "B00004TJRU", "6304626495", "B000035P9O"], "bought_together": ["6303631991"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 434629}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 21.97, "brand": "", "asin": "6305076464", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5153HAF049L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fawlty Towers - The Complete Collection [VHS]"}

In a role that catapulted her to international stardom, Nicole Kidman plays a young wife who's joined her husband (Sam Neill) on a yachting trip to recover from the tragic death of their son. Far out to sea, they encounter a sinking ship with one survivor (Billy Zane, ten years beforeTitanic), but inviting him aboard turns out to be a very bad mistake. While Neill attempts to salvage the sinking boat, Kidman is fighting for her life against the psychotic Zane--a villain so creepy that you eagerly look forward to his demise. By the time that moment arrives director Phillip Noyce has resorted to a typical slasher-movie climax (proving that no boat should be without a flare gun), but until thenDead Calmis a nail-biting thriller that's guaranteed to keep you in a state of nail-biting suspense.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0045O2PHS", "B00000IQC2", "B00004Y87P", "B000067J3P", "B000A2UBN4", "B000085EFG", "B001HN6968", "B0043X1FNQ", "B000065V3P", "B00AEFXKZ8", "6305213305", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B00002E23C", "0767802616", "B002AT8KAG", "B00B4HM6XW", "B004P7CMUU", "B00009WVSL", "B00JF5GAIW", "B00005JPUN", "0767810872", "B0013D8LKO", "B000068QPV", "B002NZK5RI", "B0007P0X9G", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B00013RC66", "0792844874", "6305308837", "B00004U2K1", "B000LC3IE2", "B0043X1FLS", "B006YTGLE0", "B00004Y87L", "6305310335", "B00151QYXU", "B00015YVDG", "B00AEBBA2W", "B0013F5L0K", "B0002DB52M", "B00004RF85", "B00005K3NU", "B0002DB54A", "B0006HBZXS", "B00008CMRK", "B00064AE0G", "6305133476", "B00AEFXBPM", "B0000VJG72", "B00H83EUQW", "B000NO1XG8", "0792846443", "B000EZ9084", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000069HZP", "6304765258", "B00005Y1UX", "0783222149", "B00005JNQA", "B00005OBBD", "0783226810", "B00GST8U4U", "B00005R5GD", "B000NO3DLG", "0790730979", "B0009X76XC", "B000P0J0C4", "B00007AJE1", "6305213283", "B004AE3QYE", "B00AEFYD9K", "0767817729", "B00IKM5MIA", "B0001US62I", "B002GHHHN8", "B0045HCJFS", "B00013RC84", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B000PHVZNE", "B00IBKXSKA", "B009R8Q8Y8", "B000EHSVNW", "B00005JN0W", "B00005BCKF", "B000I2J736", "0767809726", "0783110871", "B00005Y1UV", "B00006L91I", "B0018QPPXW", "B000CNESTE", "B00005U14H", "B00006RCNY", "B0000C3I96", "B00005JLQN", "B00006L92K", "B004SIP92O", "B0000AZT79", "0783229402"], "bought_together": ["B00000IQC2", "B000065V3P"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000085EFG", "B00000IQC2", "B0045O2PHS", "B00004Y87P"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 86274}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 27.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "6305161933", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/7184H9PXBXL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Dead Calm"}
{"description": "Based on Terry McMillan'sbest-selling novel,How Stella  Got Her Groove Backstars Angela Bassett as a 40-year-old, Manhattan stock trader and single mom whose static life gets a jolt during a vacation with her pal (Whoopi Goldberg) in Jamaica. Sparks fly when Bassett meets a 20-year-old stud (Taye Diggs) who has an ambivalent career path but a great body and lots of sexual energy to burn. After some prodding by Goldberg's warm-funny secondary character, Bassett gets it on with the fellow--and proceeds to worry about what she's doing with a man half her age. The film is most enjoyable in its sunny, exotic early scenes and becomes more formulaic once the unlikely couple transports their will-we-stay-together-or-won't-we tensions back to the Big Apple. But director Kevin Rodney Sullivan goes out of his way to make a movie unabashedly thick with fantasy and wish-fulfillment for female audiences (it's Diggs who reveals a lot more flesh than the regal Bassett).

{"description": "Francis Ford Coppola was working as an assistant to Roger Corman when he made this, his feature debut.  The story goes that Corman let Coppola make the film so long as he could work around the shooting schedule of the film they were working on together, and the results are impressive given the budget constraints. Or maybebecauseof the budget constraints.  The story concerns the family at Castle Haloran, the secrets surrounding the death of young Kathleen, and an axe murderer who seems to be picking away at all present.  Coppola's deft direction keeps this from being a routine ghost story, using light and dark in his compositions to create tension and suspense.  The film has an interesting way of spanning the traditional ghost story and the more modern gore-fests that we're used to.  I have one bone to pick with the manufacturer of this disc: the transfer to DVD was made from tape.  This is evident from the way the frames roll repeatedly during the last 15 minutes of the film, and the tape bunches a few times leaving video artifacts. DVD consumers want all the benefits of this medium, and not to have the degraded quality of tape preserved on it.  If this is the only way you can get this film, at least the price is reasonable. It's also packaged as aFright Night Horror Classicalong withNight of the Living DeadandRevolt of the Zombies.--Jim Gay", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0013D8LAE", "B000054OU5", "B000IMUYJM", "B007XF0W3K", "B00DZP1C9K", "B00009NHBC", "B005AMJ36U", "B0045HCJKS", "1559409002", "B00G5GNYY2", "B00003CXCF", "B00E5S2HGS", "0783116926", "B000C20VNM", "B0049CIURA", "B00008438U", "6305268800", "B00000ILEU", "B007UQ8IT2", "B000FFJZO2", "B00005AUK0", "B00000K3U3", "B00B2M7DKA", "B0007R4SZY", "B008BWFOXM", "B003XURDAY", "B000E991DE", "B002DU0RFS", "B00003XAMT", "B003Y7F1L4", "B00006ADD8"], "bought_together": ["B0013D8LAE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005BGRH", "B0002B55FC", "B00027JYNK", "B00C6F61HS"]}, "price": 8.03, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 566242}, "asin": "6305248125", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J95QEMBML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fright Night 2: Dementia 13"}

Parker stars as an innocent Mormon kid who gets sucked into the world of pornographic filmmaking and becomes an international sensation as the porno superhero Orgazmo, all the while hiding his secret life from his milk-fed fianc&eacute;e. It's practically a one-man show for Parker, who directs, writes, stars, and even performs the self-penned theme song as frontman for his rock band, and perhaps he should have spread the responsibilities a little.

But the film is only fitfully funny, with vulgar jokes that are often more disgusting than humorous and clumsy comic timing sabotaging promising scenes. Only rarely does it reach the heights of his hilarious cutout cartoon series, but when he delivers he does so with the carefully cultivated tasteless excess his fans have come to know and love.

{"description": "Wes Anderson's follow-up to the quirkyBottle Rocketis a wonderfully unorthodox coming-of-age story that ranks withHarold and MaudeandThe Graduatein the pantheon of timeless cult classics. Jason Schwartzman (son of Talia Shire and nephew of Francis Coppola) stars as Max Fischer, a 15-year-old attending the prestigious Rushmore Academy on scholarship, where he's failing all of his classes but is the superstar of the school's extracurricular activities (head of the drama club, the beekeeper club, the fencing club...). Possessing boundless confidence and chutzpah, as well as an aura of authority he seems to have been born with, Max finds two unlikely soulmates in his permutations at Rushmore: industrial magnate and Rushmore alumnus Herman Blume (Bill Murray) and first-grade teacher Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams). His alliance with Blume and crush on Miss Cross, however, are thrown out of kilter by his expulsion from Rushmore, and a budding romance between the two adults that threatens Max's own designs on the lovely schoolteacher.Never stooping to sentimentality or schmaltz, Anderson and cowriter Owen Wilson have fashioned a wickedly intelligent and wildly funny tale of young adulthood that hits all the right notes in its mix of melancholy and optimism. As played by Schwartzman, Max is both immediately endearing and ferociously irritating: smarter than all the adults around him, with little sense of his shortcomings, he's an unstoppable dynamo who commands grudging respect despite his outlandish projects (including a school play about Vietnam). Murray, as the tycoon who determinedly wages war with Max for the affections of Miss Cross, is a revelation of middle-aged resignation. Disgusted with his family, his life, and himself, he's turned around by both Max's antagonism and Miss Cross's love. Williams is equally affecting as the teacher who still carries a torch for her dead husband, and the superb supporting cast also includes Seymour Cassel as Max's barber father, Brian Cox as the frustrated headmaster of Rushmore, and a hilarious Mason Gamble as Max's young charge. Put this one on your shelf of modern masterpieces.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767821408", "B0000640VJ", "B0007UC8Y4", "B0010X8NF0", "B007L6VR12", "B001QOGYBI", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B000CS464G", "B007L6VR6M", "081099741X", "B0006TPE4C", "B00005JMJ4", "B0035G5IOE", "B00005JLRE", "B00005JMJG", "B00JAQJNN0", "B00007AJF8", "B00003CWTI", "B00H9HZITU", "B00441GZ1E", "B00000G02H", "B0083V2W4U", "B000A7DVR2", "B005C7SXMS", "B0006H32EI", "B000K0YLZ0", "B002O3Z4Z2", "1623160510", "B000934FC2", "B001CW7ZT4", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B001AQO400", "B001P3SA8K", "0783228457", "B00AEFXQ9S", "0571200125", "B00000ING2", "6304907729", "B00003CXGA", "B0000VD04M", "B001EOQCL2", "B003UESJHO", "B000LP6KNU", "B000Y7U98C", "B001UV4XUG", "0792846109", "B0045HCIZY", "B002VWNIAY", "B00AEFXUXU", "B007D5E7C2", "B007N5YJMA", "B003KGBIS4", "B0045NXMJE", "B00008RH3J", "B00AEFYVUQ", "B006TTC5MM", "B001MM3AZM", "B004XVMCN0", "1558908382", "B00IGK6TLA", "B0041T52S6", "B00029RTAI", "0783229526", "B00IJXJAIS", "B00004RJ73", "B003CRM6PA", "B004U7MR14", "B00005ALS0", "B004FQX5B6", "B00005QAPH", "B003ELKNH2", "B000025RE7", "B00005JNC2", "B006TTC5A4", "B00006CXGZ", "6305327068", "B00005Q4CS", "B004SEUIXS", "0792838068", "B002LMV7RA", "B00003CWOL", "B007D0FVRM", "B00A81MV3U", "B00005ATQB", "B00005V9HH", "B000IU37SO", "0783225903", "B00006LPGP", "B000M341QY", "B004SIP8ES", "B000Z8GZYW", "B00005JLSK", "B000063JDE", "B0014D5RBE", "B0018BD9DA", "B00005JPAR", "B00AFEY354", "B00079Z9VO", "B002DU39GW", "B00005O06J"], "bought_together": ["B0007UC8Y4", "B0000640VJ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00JAQJMJ0", "B0007UC8Y4", "B007L6VR12", "B0010X8NF0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2630}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.11, "brand": "DISNEY", "asin": "6305428239", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51149RFCCPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rushmore"}
{"description": "Rising to the challenge of Dogma 95's self-imposed restrictions on aesthetic freedom, Thomas Vinterberg'sThe Celebrationis a remarkable  example of the way limits can give rise to creative opportunity. (Dogma 95 is a  Danish filmmakers collective that also includes Lars von Trier, director ofBreaking the Waves. The group crafted a manifesto in which its members  vow to eschew special lighting, optical effects, props, and the visible imprint  of a director's personality in order to attain higher truths yielded by  characters.)The Celebration, shot with a small video camera and  transferred to 35mm film, concerns a black-tie birthday gathering for a  family patriarch, Helge (Henning Moritzen), which erodes into a battle after long-suppressed secrets are revealed and the chance to settle old scores  presents itself. Among the grievances are an accusation of incest and the  responsibility for the death of a child--gruesome stuff, but Vinterberg  doesn't characterize the partying crowd's reaction in quite the way one might have expected. In fact, the whole ofThe Celebrationis about  unexpected perspectives and vantage points emerging from out of nowhere, largely  due to Vinterberg's free hand at editing the film in such a way as to yank  truth from every corner. This is a strong work that belies skepticism over  Dogma 95's bare-bones trendiness, and is perhaps a harbinger of great work to  come from Vinterberg.--Tom Keogh", "price": 13.48, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 384694}, "asin": "6305495777", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RZGN5J8ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Celebration [VHS]"}

{"description": "Are you wondering just exactly who the Blair Witch was? What the Burkittsville, Maryland, legend was all about? Or what exactly fascinated student filmmaker Heather and what possibly took her, Mike, and Josh from this earth? Get all your background questions answered byCurse of the Blair Witch, a one-stop-shopping \"documentary\" originally produced for the Sci-Fi Channel as a tie-in marketing tool. Entirely fictionalized,Curse of the Blair Witchfocuses both on the past and the present, with copious info on the Blair Witch myth as well as on the disappearance of Heather, Josh, and Mike. As it turns out, the original witch was one Elly Kedward, who was accused in 1785 of taking blood from several children; she was subsequently banished to the harsh winter woods and left for dead. Her grisly and bloody legacy involves missing children, polluted water, disemboweled men, and a serial killer of children who claims to have been haunted by \"an old woman ghost.\" Aside from some ineffective \"newsreel\" footage of the serial killer, all this intriguing information is presented convincingly and chillingly.Cursemay in fact freak you out more than the movie, and it evokes the great, pulpyIn Search Ofseries of the '70s, one of the prime inspirations for filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez. News clips of the search for Heather, Josh, and Mike lend a v&eacute;rit&eacute; atmosphere to the proceedings, but shed little light on their mysterious disappearance or their characters. Basically, it's a tease to go see the movie. Still,The Blair Witch Projectprovided only ever-so-slight information on the legend that haunted the forest, so you'll want this cleverly constructed mock documentary to supplement your knowledge of the film.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["0743411536", "B0002IHP1C"], "also_viewed": ["B000056V6H"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 287495}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 7.87, "brand": "", "asin": "6305568901", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SAG2GJGGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]"}
{"description": "It might be possible to know thisLa Boh&#xE8;meand not love it, but  I have never met anyone who felt that way. \"Oh yes,\" said a friend, \"that's the  good one where everybody is the right age.\" The youth and freshness of the  singers are, in fact, major assets in this production. Youthful high spirits and  vulnerability are delicately portrayed, with sharp contrasts between the  Parisian bohemians' abject poverty and their carefree lifestyle. On DVD,La  Boh&#xE8;meis the work where the competition is strongest. Solid arguments can  be made for the staging of theMetropolitan Opera productionor the vocal quality of theSan Francisco production, but the Australian Opera offers the closest identification of  performers with the characters they represent. The effect is usually touching,  sometimes downright electrifying.For this production, the story is moved up to Paris in the 1950s. A veneer of  existentialism, a sense of the absurd, can be detected in the young men's  lifestyle, but the implicit message is that, even with electricity (e.g., a  massive neon sign celebrating \"L'Amour\"), bohemian life in the 1950s was  essentially unchanged from the 1830s. There are good performances throughout,  particularly by David Hobson (Rodolfo) and Cheryl Barker (Mimi), and the  direction of Baz Luhrmann (Strictly Ballroom,Moulin Rouge) is  outstanding.--Joe McLellan", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002Q9MZF6", "B003ELZL0Q", "B008K7RGA2", "B000094HMU", "B0015NR2F2", "B00579EKW8", "B0054YIQLW", "B000T0XEGS", "B006ZRAF0C", "B000059QY3", "B00006LLQ1", "B000050X2Z", "B0007P0LO8", "B0000041TD", "B003ZWTGKU", "B0000682UD", "B000ETRA3M", "B002LL13BQ", "B00000IBVC", "B007CYKHIW", "B000EQHHJW", "B000G1ALH0", "B001DHE9KG", "B00C70FH8G", "B00GOI2ZTG", "B007R5KKJW", "B002MEW7YY", "B00012AST0", "B0013V33DG", "B00DPMFE6U", "B00A32H1B6", "B004QQDUZ6", "B00005UVDM", "B00EWT17M0", "B00DORVS1G", "B004XJ5Y9G", "B003G0E2QY", "B0007P0LNE", "B00005A1SZ", "B00008DDRN", "B000NIWI9K", "B008FYZHZ6", "B00579EK50", "0486246078", "B009DTI3FS", "B003IKNCXQ", "B00BT70J7M", "B00508W3FW", "B009FB3YE4", "B001BWQVW2", "B0002S6428", "0780023080", "B000002ORP", "B000050X31", "B00005BI90", "B000UPSKO8", "B000UVLJJA", "B007Q1IT1I", "B00005NGAB", "6304493703", "B0002TXT2U", "B003G0E3UO", "B0007P0LPC", "B001ARDBZS", "B0007Q6PBK", "B0079IJ0R0", "630530209X", "B000BAQ8A0", "B0000DI86O", "B0001Z65R6", "B000FTJEBM", "B00007CVRJ", "B00361DR4Q", "B00AEQYM6S", "B00004Y2QP", "B008H2IIMU", "B00004R99B", "B008SBXFUU", "B002391RUS", "B001AMCFL4", "B000CIWXTQ", "B0000C7PRD", "B002S9USTE", "B0002YZWAW", "B0001VLUV6", "B001716J38"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000G1ALH0", "B002LL13BQ", "B002Q9MZF6", "B001DHE9KG"]}, "price": 26.0, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Opera & Classical Vocal"], ["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 375040}, "asin": "6305639426", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Q91685S6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Puccini - La Boh&egrave;me / Baz Luhrmann, The Australian Opera"}
{"description": "It looks like writer-director Rick Famuyiwa started a popular trend with his marriage-jitters comedy about three friends who reminisce about their lives together as one prepares to leave the group when he gets married. Everyone who rushed to seeThe Best Manshould catch this sleeper which also stars Taye Diggs (as Roland, the reluctant groom), as well as Omar Epps and Richard T. Jones, who together provide charming, cheerful performances full of warmth and humor. This buddy story is told through flashbacks to 1986, when the three met at public school. The young men gain our affection in their competition to win the most girls, which enhances the bond of loyalty we see in them as men on the eve of Roland's wedding. The casting of the boy actors is almost spooky in its perfection, especially Sean Nelson (who had already proven his acting acumen inAmerican Buffalo) as the younger version of Epps. Although the cast is African American, there's no color bar to the themes or entertainment the movie offers, providing a salient lesson to network TV producers under attack by the NAACP for their inability to include characters of color in TV shows.

But those movies have strength and an acute sense of loss along with  the sweetness and light, while--despite a death or two and the teasing  prospect of adultery--My Life So Fardoesn't really engage anything that  would disrupt its rosy childhood memoir.First-person narrator Fraser Pettigrew (Robert Norman) is age 10 in 1920, a  moment when it seems that the charmed life of Kiloran, the rambling Scottish  estate he shares with several generations of his relentlessly quaint family,  will go on forever.  Even a stray shellshock casualty from the Great War--a sub-Dickensian bogeyman who haunts the grounds--is treated as a picturesque bit of local color.  The family is what counts: would-be inventor Colin  Firth, eccentric paterfamilias and sphagnum moss farmer; his wife Mary  Elizabeth Mastrantonio, who traded an opera career for multiple maternity;  crusty uncle Malcolm McDowell, who hopes to inherit Kiloran from matriarch  Rosemary Harris and evict everybody; and Ir&egrave;ne Jacob, the beauteous young  Frenchwoman to whom the uncle is engaged and over whom everyone else goes  gaga.

{"description": "\"I have a bad feeling about this,\" says the young Obi-Wan Kenobi  (played by Ewan McGregor) inStar Wars: Episode I, The Phantom  Menaceas he steps off a spaceship and into the most anticipated cinematic event... well, ever. He might as well be speaking for the  legions of fans of the original episodes in theStar Warssaga  who can't help but secretly ask themselves: Sure, this isStar  Wars, but is itmy Star Wars? The original elevated  moviegoers' expectations so high that it would have been impossible for  any subsequent film to meet them. And as with all theStar Warsmovies,The Phantom Menacefeatures inexplicable plot twists, a  fistful of loose threads, and some cheek-chewing dialogue. Han Solo's  swagger is sorely missed, as is the pervading menace of heavy-breathing  Darth Vader. There is still way too much quasi-mystical mumbo jumbo,  and some of what was fresh aboutStar Wars22 years earlier  feels formulaic. Yet there's much to admire. The special effects are  stupendous; three worlds are populated with a m&eacute;lange of creatures, flora, and horizons rendered in absolute  detail. The action and battle scenes are breathtaking in their  complexity. And one particular sequence of the film--the  adrenaline-infused pod race through the Tatooine desert--makes the chariot race inBen-Hurlook like a Sunday stroll through the park.Among the host of new characters, there are a few familiar walk-ons. We  witness the first meeting between R2-D2 and C-3PO, Jabba the Hutt looks  younger and slimmer (but not young and slim), and Yoda is as crabby as  ever. Natalie Portman's stately Queen Amidala sports hairdos that make  Princess Leia look dowdy and wields a mean laser. We never bond with  Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson), and Obi-Wan's day is yet to come. Jar Jar Binks, a cross  between a Muppet, a frog, and a hippie, provides many of the movie's lighter moments, while Sith Lord Darth  Maul is a formidable force. Baby-faced Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) looks too young  and innocent to command the powers of the Force or wield a lightsaber (much less transmute into the future Darth Vader), but his  boyish exuberance wins over skeptics.Near the end of the movie, Palpatine, the new leader of the Republic,  may be speaking for fans eagerly awaitingEpisode IIwhen he  pats young Anakin on the head and says, \"We will watch your career with  great interest.\" Indeed! --Tod Nelson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000633ZP", "6301792734", "B00005JLXH", "B00006HBUJ", "6304539258", "6304539274", "6301792769", "B000FQVX78", "6304539290", "0792158261", "B000FQJAJG", "6304117752", "0767729307", "B001GQSY5K", "6304178352", "B000FAGGWQ", "B00BBND56G", "B000FQJAIW", "B00005LL26", "B00003CXCT", "B00003CXI0", "B002I9Z8AS", "B00006AL1C", "B00CFWWDWE", "B000066HAS", "B000001ON6", "B000MUANT6", "6305587159"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLXH", "B00006HBUJ"], "also_viewed": ["B00006HBUJ", "B00005JLXH", "B00E9PMML2", "B0000633ZP", "6301792734", "B00BBND56G", "6304539258", "6301792769", "6304539274", "B00006JDUE", "0767729307", "B00E9PMMX0", "B000FQJAIW", "B000FQVX78", "B000FQJAJG", "B00000IQMT", "B000FAGGWQ", "B003ZSJ212", "0345434110", "6303148352", "6304089767", "0439834775", "6304117752", "B00BUZW14M", "6304500831", "0590010891", "0345341465", "6304434340", "B001GQSY5K", "155890641X", "B00005LL26", "6302961572", "0792151712", "B003W77SEO", "B000M4Y8JI", "0767825411", "B00003CXXI", "B00000IZ8A", "B00169IZN8", "6302787068", "B00006G8LB", "080010367X", "0800125762", "6302091632", "0792158261", "B000850IS6", "6300214826", "6303506291", "B00005V1Z8", "B000641D2Y", "0784011923", "B00008Y47S", "6300214060", "630382790X", "B00003CXI0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 79460}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.44, "brand": "Star Wars", "asin": "630575067X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41SJPKK4S4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Wars - Episode I, The Phantom Menace [VHS]"}

{"description": "After years of dominating the midnight circuit with the likes ofNight of the Living Dead,Martin, andDawn of the Dead,  George&nbsp;A. Romero took a departure from bona fide horror films to make this naturalistic tale of a traveling troupe of motorcycle-riding jousters. (ThinkHell's Angels on Wheelsgoes to the Renaissance Faire.) While this may sound ludicrous on the surface, the film emerges as a powerful character study. When the success of their jousting tournaments--in which armor-clad bikers go at each other with real lances for the entertainment of county fair crowds--attracts the attention of bigtime promoters, creeping commercialism threatens to spoil their delicately constructed Camelot. The troupe is a mirror of King Arthur's court, complete with its King (Ed Harris), Merlin (Brother Blue), and Morgan le&nbsp;Fay (Tom Savini). Only they ride motorcycles, and try to knock each other off with maces. Ed Harris turns in a topnotch performance as Billy, the focus of the film, who goes progressively nuts as it becomes apparent he's losing his grip on the troupe (unconsciously playing out the final days of Camelot).Knightridersis thoroughly engrossing during the jousting tournaments and whenever Ed Harris is onscreen, but is less successful in-between, when toeing the line of the Arthurian Legend makes the film too mannered. And at 145&nbsp;minutes, the film could have been trimmed a bit. But why cavil when presented with the spectacle of Ed Harris spinning slowly out of control? Watch for a cameo by Stephen King himself, playing a spectator debunking the jousting tournaments as \"all fake,\" through ample mouthfuls of his hoagie.--Jim&nbsp;Gay", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000K3TO", "B001NVXMGY", "B00GNAO70K", "B0004Z33E6", "B00BCMT2BI", "B00008WJDA", "B0002KQNL8", "B008NA3I1W", "B008D9NIK4", "B004ZKKKXI", "B0045HCJKS", "B000AM6MVO", "B009R68H80", "B00005LC4Q", "B005CVFZ66", "0790742829", "B0002C9DJU", "B0006HBZXS", "B000PAAJZ6", "B0013D8LAE", "B008VF0Y0M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000MDFTHE", "B00GHH9IIA", "6304936532", "B008JFUPFI"]}, "price": 3.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 223450}, "asin": "6305808082", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513WQNHFXHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Knightriders"}

Director John Hough follows Matheson's lead with a moody but sober approach, balancing the physical threats of objects lethally leaping to life with the slow, subtle possession of the characters by a truly evil spirit.

A stark but good-looking film shot around some impressive sets, Lean's immortal adaptation is perhaps best known for Alec Guinness's remarkable (and slightly controversial) performance as Fagin, the old mentor to the gang of boy thieves.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000F17E", "B000GRUQK6", "B000C20VU0", "B000GRUQL0", "B001LMU1A0", "076781326X", "B00163JF5Q", "B0001WTUJE", "B000FQIRXQ", "B00006L918", "B00DVPMYWI", "B00AATUZQA", "B003ICZW7I", "B00K6D1QV8", "B0035ECHIG", "B001J4E1CY", "B000PKG6OY", "B00DZP1C9K", "B000025RE7", "0780021320", "B000BYA4HO", "B00005A8TV", "B00004Z1FM", "B00CEIOGZG", "B00ICWO1LC", "B00CVB6XF2", "B00CUKTHES", "B00JX3SHIC", "B00000C0QO", "B0045HCJS0", "6305094934", "0780022343", "B000063N9O", "B00065GX64", "B000HT3QBE", "B009VO9XSG", "B00EOBB866", "B006MORNW6", "B007XTDXY6", "B00012L786", "B00005A8TU", "B000W089XI", "B00005QAPJ", "B000E5LEVU", "B00HRISNPM", "B0002JP2OS", "B001CW7ZSU", "B000FILVNM", "B00007CVS3", "B00J2PQZSK", "B000FQIRYA", "B000MGBLI2", "B00004XQMY", "B0009PVZL4", "B005D0RDKM", "B000056KMW", "B001D8W7EU", "B0001I55TC", "B00000IOKV", "B004M66YUS", "B001PU8O5W", "B002U6DVQ2", "B00005BH23", "B000F7CEC0", "B00CUKTGSA", "B00092ZLEE", "B00005AUKA", "B0000B1A58", "B00007ELDG", "B000ZM1MIM", "6305257450", "B008UY8FI2", "B00005JLV7", "B003VA3JW2", "B000056HED", "B000KRNGNQ", "B00092ZLFS", "B0009PVZIW", "0780021312", "B0006Z2NAY", "B00DHN8GGW", "B00005B1ZK", "B004WPYO7E", "B00005UQ7T", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B002E01MBA", "B00004W3HG", "B00GPPXP6A", "B00005UQ7Q", "B000BYA4II", "B003MT2EK0", "B000EHQTZO", "B001BEK8C4", "B00AR30JE2", "B0009HMTDU", "0780022823", "0486424537", "B009RNK10K", "B0002V7O0Q", "B0000DJZ8R"], "bought_together": ["B00000F17E", "B000GRUQK6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["076781326X", "B000C20VU0", "B00000F17E", "B003NUH6ZQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 54411}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 26.22, "brand": "Image Entertainment", "asin": "B00000F17A", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51mN0SgGh2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Oliver Twist (The Criterion Collection)"}

{"description": "It's difficult to create a film that's fast paced, exciting, and aesthetically appealing without diluting its dialogue.Run Lola Run, directed and written by Tom Tykwer, is an enchanting balance of pace and narrative, creating a universal parable that leaps over cultural barriers. This is the story of young Lola (Franka Potente) and her boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu). In the space of 20&nbsp;minutes, they must come up with 100,000&nbsp;deutsche marks to pay back a seedy gangster, who will be less than forgiving when he finds out that Manni incompetently lost his cash to an opportunistic vagrant. Lola, confronted with one obstacle after another, rides an emotional roller coaster in her high-speed efforts to help the hapless Manni--attempting to extract the cash first from her double-dealing father (appropriately a bank manager), and then by any means necessary. From this point nothing goes right for either protagonist, but just when you think you've figured out the movie, the director introduces a series of brilliant existential twists that boggle the mind. Tykwer uses rapid camera movements and innovative pauses to explore the theme of cause and effect. Accompanied by a pulse-poundingsoundtrack, we follow Lola through every turn and every heartbreak as she and Manni rush forward on a collision course with fate. There were a variety of original and intelligent films released in 1999, but perhaps none were as witty and clever as this little gem--one of the best foreign films of the year.--Jeremy Storey", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 496767}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.74, "brand": "", "asin": "B000021Y74", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KYAD2YAVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Run Lola Run [VHS]"}

{"description": "Cooley Highhas frequently been compared toAmerican Graffiti, and for good reason. Like that classic,Cooley Highhas a loose, multicharacter structure, autobiographical origins, and the rich texture of its time. Set in Chicago in 1964, the movie follows aspiring writer Preach (Glynn Turman) and local basketball star Cochise (Lawrence-Hilton Jacobs, who went on to star inWelcome Back, Kotter) as they wander their neighborhood, drifting in and out of their classes at Cooley Vocational High School. The two friends pull pranks, crash parties, commit petty crimes, and generally try to enjoy their lives in an impoverished urban environment. Preach falls in love with a smart girl named Brenda (Cynthia Davis), whom he wins over by reciting poetry--leading to one of the silliest and sweetest love scenes you'll ever see. When Preach and Cochise go on a joy ride with a pair of young hoods, they end up arrested. Their history teacher, Mr. Mason (a superb Garrett Morris), gets them off, but the hoods think the boys sold them out and come seeking revenge.Cooley Highdepicts the rough life of African Americans in the 1960s with honesty and humor, offering no easy solutions or pat lessons. It's a roughly made movie, but Turman and Jacobs are both excellent, and there's an attention to reality that makes it engaging, refreshing, and ultimately moving. The soundtrack is a great compilation of 1960s soul, including the Supremes, Martha and the Vandellas,  Stevie Wonder, the Four Tops, and Smokey Robinson.

{"description": "As revisionist history, Michael Mann's intelligent docudramaThe Insideris a simmering brew of altered facts and dramatic license. In a broader perspective, however, the film (cowritten withForrest GumpOscar-winner Eric Roth) is effectively accurate as an engrossing study of ethics in the corruptible industries of tobacco and broadcast journalism. On one side, there is Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe), the former tobacco scientist who violated contractual agreements to expose Brown & Williamson's inclusion of addictive ingredients in cigarettes, casting himself into a vortex of moral dilemma. On the other side is60&nbsp;Minutesproducer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), whose struggle to report Wigand's story puts him at odds with veteran correspondent Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer) and senior executives at CBS News.As the urgency of the story increases, so does the film's palpable sense of paranoia, inviting favorable comparison toAll the President's Men. While Pacino downplays the theatrical excess that plagued him in previous roles, Crow is superb as a man who retains his tortured integrity at great personal cost.The Insideris two movies--a cover-up thriller and a drama about journalistic ethics--that combine to embrace the noble values personified by Wigand and Bergman. Even if the details aren't always precise (as Mike Wallace and others protested prior to the film's release), the film adheres to a higher truth that was so blatantly violated by tobacco executives seen in an oft-repeated video clip, lying under oath in the service of greed.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002DU39GW", "B00005BCKF", "0470499052", "0314277447", "B0002XNT12", "0314904573", "B0038Z5T4Q", "074945332X", "B00337KM2S", "B003L20IG0", "630542828X", "0205667503", "B001N44BVQ", "B000H0MKOC", "B000CNESTE", "B00121QGPY", "B00441GYPG", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00004YA78", "B0001HLVS2", "B00BTYOYG2", "B000CEXEWA", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005JKG9", "B00AEFXYJA", "B000085OXZ", "B00BB67UNW", "B0035JHYGQ", "B00003CXFV", "B00004Y7Y4", "B00005JLX2", "B00AEBB95K", "B000XR9L50", "B000LXHK2C", "B000CNESU8", "B00441GYOM", "B00003CWUX", "B00A2H9VKG", "B002VWNICC", "B001AS32QK", "B000059TFO", "0780622561", "B002CPMB9O", "B0000296JH", "007337959X", "B000ARTN3I", "B002O3Z4WU", "B004SIP6C2", "B0000AM6JI", "B000OYAT3U", "B005FITIGO", "B00005JKMQ", "B0034G4P7G", "0792838947", "B00008CMRK", "B00003CXP7", "B000CQLZ8S", "B00004Z1FL", "B0001907AI", "B004SUDQ1S", "B00CLH0848", "0767817710", "B00007G1YQ", "B00008R9KG", "B000C3L2IO", "B0031OCY2E", "B00127RAGC", "B003U0AHBO", "B00JBGSHSQ", "B004IFYMWK", "B00004XPPB", "B0009OUBC4", "B004U7MR1Y", "B00008BNTD", "B001EJW0SG", "0783226845", "B003LR5BD0", "6304696507", "B0001I56FA", "B00DDY45DI", "B00GUO2SKA", "B0000YEEGM", "B000HT38IK", "B00006RCNV", "B000UGBOT0", "B000A9QK5K", "B000A9QK6E", "B00IJS2OHM", "B006DHATE6", "B0002J4X2K", "B000MXPE7O", "B004SIP7TE", "6305428115", "B00BLF9FYA", "B00AEBB9EG", "B0036TGSR6", "0783229402", "B00005BCK9", "B00004RE27"], "bought_together": ["B002DU39GW", "B003L20IG0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002DU39GW", "B000Y11B8U", "B003L20IG0", "B00005JN2Z"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17334}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.75, "brand": "Disney", "asin": "B00003CWRX", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y28RGA5AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Insider"}

{"description": "As the triumphant start of a trilogy,The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ringleaves you begging for more. By necessity, Peter  Jackson's ambitious epic compresses J.R.R. Tolkien's classicThe Lord of the Rings,  but this robust adaptation maintains reverent allegiance to Tolkien's creation,  instantly qualifying as one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. At 178  minutes, it's long enough to establish the myriad inhabitants of Middle-earth,  the legendary Rings of Power, and the fellowship of hobbits, elves, dwarves, and  humans--led by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the brave hobbit Frodo  (Elijah Wood)--who must battle terrifying forces of evil on their perilous  journey to destroy the One Ring in the land of Mordor. Superbly paced, the film  is both epic and intimate, offering astonishing special effects and production  design while emphasizing the emotional intensity of Frodo's adventure. Ending on  a perfect note of heroic loyalty and rich anticipation, this wondrous fantasy  continues inThe Two Towers(2002).--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B005COPWZW", "B00005JM5E", "B002ZG980U", "B002PMV9FG", "B001GZ6QC4", "B007K3JFUQ", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JNJV", "B001OQCV6A", "B004M1A21K", "B008UZ7MYY", "B00HFFE8HE", "B000A9QKLO", "B000E8M0VA", "B000W7F5SS", "B0014C2FX8", "0618640150", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00003CX5P", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00005QZWI", "B0019L770A", "B000I0RQVI", "B002IPFWTE", "B001CDR1FG", "B0006UEVT0", "B003TT2X6S", "B001OQCV2E", "B009JBWOU0", "B00005JL78", "B00005JNOG", "B001UV4XHY", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B00GKOJ98E", "0345325818", "B0014Z4ON4", "B000H30B2C", "B005LXQLRW", "B001UV4XIS", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00CZDLGDU", "0345538374", "B004LWZW42", "B007REV4T8", "B000W746GK", "B00005JPH2", "B003TT2X72", "B004LWZWGA", "B0087ZG7J8", "B005G4TJUC", "B003ZK99NQ", "B00006HBUJ", "B008UZA8FY", "B0090SI56Y", "B000VI70QS", "B00005JNC2", "B004WCTLNY", "B0014Z4OMU", "6305313687", "B004AKCME8", "B000E6EK2Y", "0547928211", "B000LC55F2", "B0002KVUKM", "B000FQJAIW", "B008JFUO72", "B000FIMG68", "B005LAIHSG", "B005LAIIT4", "B004AOECXI", "B00029RTCG", "B000P0J0EM", "B002HWRYJE", "B0060FXDCG", "B001ECQ75A", "0792839749", "B00AEFXZJE", "B005LAII0I", "B0042U94UQ", "B001HN6918", "B00008G8M5", "B008JFURII", "B003ZKBELG", "B000P0J09W", "B003XURDAY", "B00335EQ0E", "B00008G8M4", "0547928203", "B000W796OM", "B00006ADD5", "B00J49R1BY", "B00B04NIZO", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00001ZWUS"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HFFE8HE", "B00005JKZY", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00005JKZV"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3641}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.49, "brand": "NEW Line Home Video", "asin": "B00003CWT6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Dj%2BQ1hLBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)"}

{"description": "James Spader stars as Joel Campbell, a former detective traumatized by the death of his lover at the hands of a serial killer he'd been hunting--a psychopath who has taken their combative relationship a little too personally, and has now tracked the retired Campbell down in Chicago. The killer, who methodically studies his victims before killing them, starts sending Campbell photographs of prospective victims and gives him a day to find them before they're killed. Campbell rises to the challenge, returns to his role as detective, and launches a comprehensive manhunt for the killer and the women in the photographs.The Watcheris surprisingly watchable--though it does suffer from an excessive use of arty cinematography. But while the psychological interpretation of the killer's behavior is a little too schematic to be convincing, the portrayal of Campbell is quite strong, particularly due to Spader's performance. A much-underrated actor, Spader is lean and efficient in his portrayal, rarely given to flashy histrionics, but compelling and emotionally complex. Unfortunately, the killer is played by Keanu Reeves; and though Reeves isn't as terrible an actor as some critics may say, he's out of his depth here. Still, Spader carries most of the movie, and the sequences in which the police are trying to track down the victims are nicely suspenseful--in fact, the movie is overall more interested in suspense than gore, making it a pleasant change from most contemporary thrillers. Also starring Marisa Tomei as Campbell's psychiatrist and budding romantic interest.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006FFRR0", "B0006IIPLM", "B000A2X4BK", "B00006L92O", "0767812158", "B000LC3I9W", "B0000WN1N6", "B000RF7XZ8", "6305922675", "B00BTYJYOY", "B0041KKXQG", "B00BTYMPSQ", "B001BP4K22", "B00HNGC516", "B0001VTPUE", "B000NTMA0Q", "B0000CABBQ", "B0002DRDY6", "B0000BXMZ3", "B003Y5H59C", "B00DMI56CY", "B00FEHCQEC", "B00553KAHA", "B002YMWQ9U", "B000EHSVBE", "0780627849", "B00LEW3L5Y", "B001B18716", "B001SGEUYW", "B00005JH9M", "B0009MDPYM", "B005LS4MQE", "B001SMC9IU", "B002GIBVWA", "B000RO6JZE", "B0000844I8", "B000HT3P56", "B001Q8MMBK", "0800177029", "B00JA3RVG4", "B000QXDCLA", "B002D755A8", "B0006GANOQ", "B003DY6ACM", "B000053VAX", "0767802454", "B00FZ2NTOM", "B008FYZHDI", "6305065551", "B00BLSD5MK", "B0034G4P30", "B00005A3KS", "B004SIP9CO", "0783240295", "B00006SFJK", "B000G5SILC", "B00004UE5U", "6305767866", "6301094409", "B00005JKE4", "B002O3Z4XY", "B00015HX6S", "6301971345", "B0027CSMY0", "B00I208ZHA", "B00029RT9E", "B0058ZPNBI", "B00GNAO70K", "6305428115", "B00009OWJX", "B000MEYKEG", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00AEBB8O2", "B00005PJ6M", "B00JU949TK", "B002NZK5RI", "B000FFJ826", "B00IARA8KM", "B005R08HJY", "B002XMGGK6", "B000FFL2G6", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B0000714C1", "B00FEVZH8K", "B00AEBB89W", "B00H91LWDC", "B000JMK6LW", "B0040J1RX6", "B000BUNZY2", "B005LAIILM", "B009HIKAN8", "B00HHYF570", "B00008EY9G", "B0009YA3OA", "0800177789", "6305428360", "B000R4SMCW", "0767810872", "B00J0IN6Z4"], "bought_together": ["B0006IIPLM", "B000LC3I9W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0006IIPLM", "0767812158", "B000NTMA0Q", "B0006FFRR0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 16810}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.93, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

Populated with strange characters, including a blind prophet, sexy sirens, and a one-eyed Bible salesman (John Goodman, COYOTE UGLY), it's an odyssey filled with chases, close calls, near misses, and betrayal that will leave you laughing at every outrageous and surprising twist and turn.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004XQ83", "B00006LPGP", "B00005NVHA", "B00009W5CA", "B00029LNYQ", "B004U7MR3M", "B000A7DVR2", "B000P0J0EW", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000M7XRAG", "B003UESJME", "B00008RH3J", "B003102JDM", "B00008RH3L", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00007ELF1", "B00006CXGZ", "B0000YTP02", "B001JIE7JC", "B0041SI78O", "B002VECMAE", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B00000GQ3T", "B00A144O70", "6305212112", "B001B1UO7G", "B003AWRMCE", "0792843568", "B004SIP95G", "B002T9H2LA", "B001VC99HQ", "B000XR9L50", "B004SEUJO6", "B004AOECXI", "B002VWNICC", "6304711905", "B007L6VR12", "B007N31YH0", "B0000TANUI", "B0007PALZ2", "B000E8QVWY", "B0000033GO", "B0002V7ON8", "B00AEFXNLY", "B00AEFYMGO", "B001HN69AY", "B002VWNIAY", "B00AEBB9SM", "B0001GOH6Q", "B002VWNIBI", "B0009IOR5M", "B000RTB0R6", "0767818105", "B000GFRI4K", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B004SIP90G", "B0001Z4OXS", "B001KXZGO6", "B0001NBMTE", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B00AEBB8NS", "B00000G3PA", "B005LAIIJY", "B0002A2WDQ", "078322592X", "B0019L770A", "B00003CXC5", "B00H7KJRVY", "B00005JNBQ", "B00177YA1K", "B001DZOCY6", "B002VECM6S", "B0000JBALO", "B00EIBO8T6", "B00005PJ6O", "0767836359", "B000056VP4", "B0000CBY1C", "B00287Z18Y", "0783237367", "B00003CXIP", "B00AEFXJ86", "B00AEBB8NI", "B007STBUHI", "6305236569", "B00AEFXDO6", "0783230494", "B002NZK5TG", "0783229526", "B00553K8FY", "B00005JNY3", "B000A2UBN4", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00005V9HH", "B0000AC8LR", "B00AEBB9FA", "0767802519", "B00AEBB9F0", "B0012IWNZY"], "bought_together": ["B00004XQ83"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004XQ83", "B00G4DTSUK", "B00003CXC3", "B00006LPGP"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2194}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.19, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00003CXRM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5107M4P37AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "O Brother, Where Art Thou?"}

{"description": "Five comely and well-to-do female friends receive dire threats inside anonymous valentines. When two of them meet violent ends, the remaining trio suspect that the killer may be a nebbishy former classmate whom they spurned years before at a school dance. Their solution: Throw a lavish Valentine's Day party, all the better to distract them from the hulking, cherub-masked killer...As the above suggests,Valentineis the absolute nadir of the post-Screamslasher film. Australian director Jamie Blanks (whose previous effort was the equally dismalUrban Legend, 1998) obviously had lofty goals for his film, given his bald-faced homages to John Carpenter and Dario Argento. But he hasn't a clue as to how to generate suspense, and his frequent reliance on well-worn shock effects (hands dropping on shoulders, etc.) suggests more contempt for the genre than affection. No less than four writers (including two writer-producers forRoswell, which explains the appearance of series star Katherine Heigl) contributed to the screenplay, which fails to generate the twentysomething drama and hip, cutting dialogue required for this brand of horror. As the five friends, actresses Marley Shelton, Denise Richards, Jessica Capshaw, Jessica Caufield, and Heigl have little to do other than alternately look attractive or afraid; Richards, in particular, looks weary of playing the man-eater. As Shelton's dipsomaniac boyfriend, David Boreanaz (Angel) lumbers through each scene with an embarrassed scowl.Warner Bros.'

{"description": "Not only will the dog in \"My Dog Skip\"-an adorable Jack Russell Terrier-make you ooh and aah, but the story will melt your heart. It's sweet and well-told, good entertainment for a Saturday night with the family.The time: the 1940's, during World War II. Nine-year-old Willie Morris, played by Malcolm In the Middle's Frankie Muniz, is not exactly the tough neighborhood kid. When his only friend, his next-door neighbor and town high school jock named Dink, goes off to war, Willie's left alone-until his parents get him a dog.  He and his dog Skip forge a strong and lasting bond, the kind the words \"a boy and his dog\" have always meant in the deepest sense.Based on a true story, the tale follows Willie Morris' own childhood memories, poignantly illustrating the struggles of growing up. If you don't own a dog, you'll wish you had one, especially if you have an only child. If you do own a dog, you'll snuggle up with him after the movie is over.Muniz does a great job of making us laugh and get teary-eyed. Diane Lane is perfect as his mom, and Kevin Bacon is excellent as Willie's stern but loving father. Luke Wilson charms everyone as Willie's changed-by-war neighbor, Dink. Funny and heartwarming, you can enjoy this one with the whole family-again and again.

While theSeaview, the world's most advanced experimental submarine,  maneuvers under the North Pole, the Van Allen radiation belt catches fire,  giving the concept \"global warming\" an entirely new dimension. As the Earth  broils in temperatures approaching 170 degrees&nbsp;F, Walter Pidgeon's  maniacally driven Admiral Nelson hijacks theSeaviewand plays tag with  the world's combined naval forces on a race to the South Pacific, where he plans  to extinguish the interstellar fire with a well-placed nuclear missile. But  first he has to fight a mutinous crew, an alarmingly effective saboteur, not one  but two giant squid attacks, and a host of design flaws that nearly cripple the  mission (note to Nelson: think backup generators). Barbara Eden shimmies to  Frankie Avalon's trumpet solos in the most formfitting naval uniform you've ever  seen, fish-loving Peter Lorre plays in the shark tank, gloomy religious fanatic  Michael Ansara preaches Armageddon, and Joan Fontaine looks very uncomfortable  playing an armchair psychoanalyst. It's all pretty absurd, but Allen pumps it up  with larger-than-life spectacle and lovely miniature work.--Sean  AxmakerFantastic Voyage2001: A Space Odysseytook the world on  a mind-bending trip to outer space, butFantastic Voyageis the original  psychedelic inner-space adventure. When a brilliant scientist falls into a coma  with an inoperable blood clot in the brain, a surgical team embarks on a  top-secret journey to the center of the mind in a high-tech military submarine  shrunk to microbial dimensions. Stephen Boyd stars as a colorless commander sent  to keep an eye on things (though his eyes stay mostly on shapely medical  assistant Raquel Welch), while Donald Pleasance is suitably twitchy as the  claustrophobic medical consultant. The science is shaky at best, but the  imaginative spectacle is marvelous: scuba-diving surgeons battle white blood  cells, tap the lungs to replenish the oxygen supply, and shoot the aorta like  daredevil surfers. The film took home a well-deserved Oscar for Best Visual  Effects. Director Richard Fleischer, who turned Disney's 195420,000 Leagues  Under the Seainto one of the most riveting submarine adventures of all  time, creates a picture so taut with cold-war tensions and cloak-and-dagger  secrecy that niggling scientific contradictions (such as, how do miniaturized  humans breathe full-sized air molecules?) seem moot.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00007JMD8", "B000SAGGL4", "B00006JDRG", "B00005JKU0", "B00008438U", "B0045HCJSA", "B00018D3ZA", "B0007R4T1W", "B0001I55XI", "B00AEBB8VK", "B000AQKU72", "B000BZISS0", "B0007R4T26", "B0001I55SS", "B00005JKFR", "B002945DU2", "B000063UR0", "6305761078", "B000FFJ87Q", "B000HEWEDK", "6305869367", "B00AEBB94G", "B00HFWETIK", "B000067J17", "B001DB6J50", "B0044XV7AQ", "0767810864", "B00005Y6XR", "B000RXVNDI", "B00347AIN0", "B0007R4SZY", "B00B2M7DKA", "B000GUJZ0U", "B00000IREA", "B0045HCJKS", "B000BMY2KG", "B000E1BXFG", "B000063UR1", "B001MT7ZJC", "B00009NHBC", "B0001CNRLQ", "B001AR0D40", "B000BOH8Z0", "B003J216K4", "B00480OC0C", "B000FVQLKW", "6305944288", "B0002NRRRY", "B0001US8F8", "B0002NRRQU", "B0024LIBDQ", "B000062XE5", "B000TLTCTK", "B00005NSXY", "B0066E6O7C", "B00D9EJFZA", "B00AFEYS9A", "B00005R1O7", "B000I8OM94", "B00001TZ6Q", "B002VA5A02", "0767847431", "B000FOPPEC", "0783240961", "B000056NWI", "B000AYELJ2", "B002TSAAS8", "B0044O1Q60", "B0013LL2Z2", "B000A2WJBQ", "B0006B2A42", "B000QGEB1W", "B0001CNRNE", "B000O599YY", "B00014NEX0", "B0016LFG2O", "B000EHQTZO", "B00J0IN6Z4", "B000P0J0BU", "B007Y1NNAW", "B0000648ZQ", "B002CWKU18", "B008M4C1DU", "B004S8UTII", "B00023BKMC", "B002NZK5WS", "B001BN4WI6", "B001PO55LE", "B000O78KWE", "B0002XVQNK", "B00AMSM9CW", "B00B2M7ENG", "B000035Z3K", "B0001CNRLG", "630542845X", "B00E5G03I4", "B0002IQKAY", "0767812166"], "bought_together": ["B00007JMD8", "B0045HCJSA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000O78KWE", "B000O78KY2", "B00005JKU0", "B00007JMD8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 93508}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 17.75, "brand": "", "asin": "B00004VVOH", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51W14M5006L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea / Fantastic Voyage"}
{"description": "As the millennium turns, the crazed trend to produce direct-to-video sequels swells. Very few of these sequels are inspired, although most do not harm their origins. One might understandably pick up something labeled \"from the makers ofThe Prince of Egyptwith trepidation. Happily, the makers leave Moses alone and tell the tale of another Bible star, Joseph, known for his coat of many colors and a fantastic destiny. Joseph (voiced by Ben Affleck), his father's favorite son, is sold into slavery by his jealous half-brothers. After years of struggle, Joseph rises to be the Pharaoh's trusted adviser when his gift for interpreting dreams pays dividends.

{"description": "Perhaps the least important thing about this latest film version of Shakespeare's masterpiece is its setting in modern-day New York. Yes, such locales as the Guggenheim Museum are used wittily; answering machines and faxes are logically worked into the plot; and it was both inspired and entirely appropriate to make the prince of Denmark a moody, introspective filmmaker whose avant-garde collages provide the context for some of his famous monologues. All of which would be so much pleasantly humorous eye-candy if it didn't come hand in hand with a sympathy for and understanding of this remarkable cast of characters. For that, ultimately, is what makes Michael Almereyda'sHamletsuch a delight to watch. Forget that the immortal rumination on suicide is placed in a Blockbuster Video aisle and notice instead how Ethan Hawke's own youthful, callow arrogance makes Hamlet's vacillations believable.  And how the comical but infantilizing way Bill Murray's Polonius dotes upon his daughter Ophelia (Julia Stiles)--and her mute acceptance of his attentions--lead her to thoughts of a watery grave even before her bout of madness. And also notice how much Claudius truly does love Gertrude (when gazing at her, Kyle MacLachlan's face relaxes from its usual plasticity) and how Sam Shepard's ghost is less vengeful or tortured than stiffened by remorse. These are the shining moments of invention in Almereyda's bold updating of the play, and they are why this will be a film to watch and enjoy long after its setting has made it as much a period piece as Olivier's adaptation, with its broodingly lit castle, or Branagh's, with its gleaming 19th-century court.--Bruce Reid", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00019072G", "B00005JLCI", "B0038RSJ0U", "0780021312", "B00443FMKM", "B005COLEOA", "B000777I88", "B004M9ZI0M", "B000E6ESKS", "B0059XTUR2", "B000SIWH0U", "0792844041", "B00B6OEEKQ", "B00005U8EL", "B00CDV4JNS", "6305622876", "B00ECR7KX2", "B000QGE8IS", "B0007WRT4Q", "B00000JL7T", "B0002TVWYW", "B008H6GHE2", "B00B1E6EAY", "B001TR4G6W", "B000063JZQ", "B00AZFECHW", "B0088XQDD4", "B000K7VHLY", "B00J379KKW", "B0000714BZ", "0743288491", "B00080ZGHO", "B00005RDRT", "B00AMEZDPG", "B0051HCUMS", "1932219080", "B000HWZ4AC", "B00008US5Q", "B000260R64", "0982153317", "B0012EM5CE", "B00005S872", "B00DQN6IOK", "B008D1A18E", "B0038RSIGA", "B004H0M31I", "B003H0ZGWW", "B004SIP9U6", "B007RP4CAA", "B000QGE8JC", "B000HEWENA", "B004AV5GXG", "B007I1Q4YU", "B00063MC1Q", "B007JVSRKS", "B00H4BHIGW", "B000E6ESK8", "B002E01MBA", "079284615X", "B00006674E", "B000K2Q7H8", "1561374180", "B00019JRFY", "B00A7OBIGO", "B000ALAT64", "B000BP86VE", "B00DHHWXYY", "B00447L4KA", "B0002235QM", "B00007KQA2", "B00AGKHF1G", "0393315053", "B00IAD18FK", "B0002T2Q6U", "1411498739", "B0009PVZD2", "0780021320", "B00B2BYY1W", "B00DEYJSF2", "B007I1Q50S", "B001AQT0ZO", "B00005UJY8", "B000OY9VFW", "0316540838", "0783240325", "B001O7R75O", "B0002T2QAQ", "B00HQFA1VA", "B000QGE8J2", "1586638440", "B007I1Q4UY", "B007RP4BZ6", "B007H7OQW2", "B004P29LDG", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B0059XTUT0", "B002SF9YMU", "B00A44GNTE", "B0013D8LWC", "B003Y5H5JM"], "bought_together": ["B00019072G", "B00005JLCI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00019072G", "B0038RSJ0U", "B00005JLCI", "B00443FMKM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 196854}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.65, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00004Z4RP", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NK8M7QHJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hamlet"}
{"description": "If you've seenScreamandI Know What You Did Last Summer, then you know the entire plot ofScary Movie. That's okay, though, because this is a parody, and it helps to know the story in order to be able to get the jokes. No, the biggest surprise here is not the  story as much as the amount of full-frontal male nudity. Really, in addition to all the dick jokes (and the ass jokes and fart jokes), there's a couple of shots of the male member, one of which is erect and used as a weapon.Scary Moviesomehow ended up with an R rating, which in a sense is groundbreaking; perhaps our ratings board is loosening up after all.But is it funny? That's the most important question, and the answer to that is yes. In the vein ofAirplane!, with a dash of the Farrelly brothers,Scary Moviekeeps throwing jokes at you one after another. The law of averages says some of them have to hit, and enough of them do to keep the movie entertaining. Unlike the makers ofAirplane!, however, the Wayans brothers aren't making this movie out of a love of the genre, and unlike the Farrelly brothers, they don't make fun of retarded people with any sort of respect, so the humor throughout feels a lot uglier. Still, there are enough funny scenes inScary Movieto make the viewing experience worthwhile. Special credit must go to Lochlyn Munro as Greg, the over-the-top jock, who steals the movie up until the time he's gotta die.--Andy Spletzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SIP9I8", "B004SIP9KQ", "B000FOQ1KY", "B00CAATSME", "B0009P42WI", "B001J710YI", "B004SIP9O2", "B00AZMFINM", "B004SIP9MY", "B0016MJ6J2", "B004SIP9P6", "B000F9RLL2", "B004LWZW2O", "B005CFBYW6", "B004P7CMZ0", "6305017115", "B005DCJ218", "B0000VCZMK", "B00177YA06", "0780631684", "B000055WFZ", "B00008K7AM", "B002IT5GDC", "B000O76ZOO", "B0002VYOVI", "B00AEFXQLQ", "B000RIWAVW", "B001NPD9LS", "B000069CF0", "B004SIP8ES", "B00441GYVA", "630529142X", "B000FA57UI", "B000AM4P9K", "B009XTF8KQ", "B002A5EBMQ", "0767811070", "B00AEFYPXY", "B00005LC4Q", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B000K405CY", "B000IFRT4W", "B0021L8UXA", "B003Q6D27S", "B000FC2HS6", "B00081912E", "B00003CY5Y", "0783235070", "B00AEFYYH6", "B00H0EN98E", "B004EPZ084", "B000FA57US", "B001P3SA9Y", "B0031U8OEK", "B00003CXPS", "B003PIUINS", "B000VKL6Z2", "B001L9EXUC", "B000WZEZGI", "B003UESJBU", "B005DEUEXQ", "B00003CXS7", "B00009PY4G", "B00BEIYGT8", "B002GHHHG0", "B006W4KVH0", "B000GBEWHK", "B00AJLHUA8", "B002ZG971U", "B000WGYMTC", "B00J5JSV3A", "B00005K3NR", "B000J4QW7W", "B001J9KJ4I", "B00003CXZ1", "B004EPZ06G", "B000V4UFZK", "B0006SSOHC", "B00001QGUM", "B000022TSW", "B00AEFYE08", "0767824954", "B000031WD9", "B00004STUL", "B00005JNZU", "B004SEUJO6", "B008R65XTC", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B00AEFY37C", "B002ZG97TW", "B00005N7Z1", "B004P7CN7W", "B00003CY6D", "B00E8RKHWW", "B00BEIYMZ6", "B008G33PIM", "B000P0J09M", "B00006FDCD", "B00AEFYQWO"], "bought_together": ["B004SIP9I8", "B004SIP9KQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FOQ1KY", "B004SIP9KQ", "B004SIP9I8", "B008MXMFVE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 150447}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.99, "brand": "Dimension", "asin": "B00004Z4WQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5123WET5P4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Scary Movie"}
{"description": "As a producer, Jerry Bruckheimer makes movies for guys, mostly action  films likeTop GunandGone in 60 Seconds. The ones he makes that feature women, such asFlashdanceand nowCoyote Ugly, broaden their appeal with a fondness for \"strong women.\" For Bruckheimer, that means self-determined, attractive women who don't need men to get what they want. Is there anything sexier than that? InCoyote Ugly, the charming young waif Piper Perabo stars as Violet, a New Jersey waitress who moves to New York to make it big as a songwriter. She has absolutely no idea how the music business works, relying instead on her faith in her own abilities. In order to make ends meet, she gets a job in a bar called Coyote Ugly, where the bartenders are scantily clad women who dance on the bar and order around their mostly male clientele. Really, they are strippers who don't have to take off their clothes. In fact, the owner (Maria Bello) orders them to enact the first rule of strip clubs: \"Appear available but never be available.\" Bruckheimer is smart enough to focus on the naive girl instead of the seamier side of the story, following her as  she realizes her dream and picks up a disposable but nice man along the way. Further \"empowering\" the female figures in the film, Zoe (Tyra Banks), the  bartender whom Violet is replacing, leaves in order to go to law school. See?  They're as smart as they are sexy! Then there's John Goodman, who turns in an absolutely charming performance as Violet's concerned father. This is a sweet and inoffensive film as long as you don't think too much about it.--Andy Spletzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AMEZDJW", "B002ZG976U", "B00004W1OR", "B005Z9MFRC", "B004SIP9X8", "B00447L4KA", "B00003CXMP", "B00007E2F5", "B00006ZXSL", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B0000DIXDR", "B00004Z4WR", "B00081U7HC", "B00004XPPD", "B000J3OTSM", "B00AMEZDII", "B00AEFXZJE", "B0001CNRS4", "B000J4QW7W", "B00AEFY99O", "B00006ZXSK", "B002ZG989G", "B00DMDE02Q", "B000ELJAEM", "B00AEFY4CG", "B0007PLLBU", "B0036TGSIK", "B00001PE4D", "B002NZK5V4", "B000083MCT", "6305428425", "B004529NKC", "B00AEBB8R4", "B00004Y2R1", "B00005JCCB", "B00000F0AD", "B00AEFY5TI", "B0012QCZ54", "B00000G3PA", "B00AEFXZVM", "B004EPZ0BG", "B000065V3G", "B000NA1WE0", "B00AEFXZ1C", "B0002WZTOI", "B009ANP4F4", "B003NHRIVQ", "B008WCP2PG", "B003Y5H524", "B002ZG988M", "B00002SSKI", "B00005JM23", "B000P0J0CY", "0767810856", "B00005JKWM", "B001K2LFNI", "B0009OL7Z4", "B00441GYVK", "6305236569", "B000077VR3", "B002K0WBXW", "B008JFUUIA", "B003Y5H574", "B00005JMW7", "B000GB775E", "B000YAA68C", "B00003CY5P", "B002P413IC", "B00AEFXYOA", "B00AMSS3TA", "B003QZSWU6", "B00005TNER", "B00003CXTG", "B008R65XWO", "B00AEFYM2S", "B00AEFYQE2", "B00005JLH0", "B000IZJZIU", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00164KYV4", "B00005JLQE", "B00005JPK8", "B00005JOZC", "6304696558", "B00866JL96", "B000QUU4LY", "B00AEBB9ZK", "B00008G7UM", "B003B3V0N4", "B002ZG98RS", "B0000VD02Y", "B00AEBB8NS", "B00AG473GE", "B000P0J0C4", "B000083C6I", "6305428549", "B00008G7UI", "B0006N2EZ0", "B000FI8MPW", "B002DKGWSE"], "bought_together": ["B00AMEZDJW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00447L4KA", "B002ZG976U", "B00AMEZDJW", "B0036TGSIK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 4602}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.97, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B0000524E5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51T1B7BF7YL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Coyote Ugly"}

{"description": "They get drunk on sour milk. They have two hearts and bald,  spotted heads. They're highly intelligent, but if you drop them in  seawater they'll melt into a puddle of goop. They're \"Newcomers,\" and  they arrived as refugees in a massive alien slave-ship, quarantined for  three years and then reluctantly accepted as citizens of Earth. To some  humans--including seasoned Los Angeles cop Matt Sykes (James Caan)--the  Newcomers are unwelcome \"slags.\" Sykes's own virulent \"speciesism\"  intensifies when Newcomer thugs kill his partner, but he sees logic in  teaming up with Sam Francisco (Mandy Patinkin), the first Newcomer  detective in the LAPD. Francisco's Newcomer knowledge is vital to their  investigation of an alien drug ring, and a friendship grows from  life-or-death circumstances.A routine cop thriller with a comedic sci-fi twist,Alien  Nation>has two things working in its favor: Caan and Patinkin form  a memorable duo, and the basic premise--as conceived by Rockne S.  O'Bannon (who later developed the film as a TV series)--intelligently  accounts for the sociological impact of an alien population. The subtle  point is made that humans are extraordinary beings who squander their  potential, and the evil of drugs--as dealt by a social-climbing  Newcomer played by Terence Stamp--leads to a crisis that threatens to  generate global intolerance. These points are well presented in a  context of overly familiar plotting and standard-issue sarcasm. It's  entertaining for a brisk 90 minutes, but in its attempt to be widely  appealing,Alien Nationglosses over issues that might have made  it more uniquely provocative.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BOH8Y6", "B000WLU5ZM", "B000QXDCJ2", "0780628586", "B000067FP2", "B00005B8UD", "B00023BKMC", "B0019BI1DM", "B00F3L8P26", "B001RHGRTS", "6305869103", "0792839684", "B0002MHDW4", "B00JL6L4UY", "B0009JE6G6", "B00453QOC6", "B00005O5B5", "B000W4KT9G", "B0045HCJKS", "0767812166", "B001BGS17Q", "B00K7IPFSM", "B00AEBB8VK", "B000ELL1QC", "B000092Q4V", "B003H9LIU2", "B00004Y87O", "B0045HCJSA", "B00BTYPW7C", "B003R0MEYA", "B0011367SY", "B00IWTVDUW", "B0045HCJT4", "B002U0KHME", "B0009S4IF6", "B00404ME2E", "0792838947", "B00HFWETZ8", "B000JLTRHW", "B0000DZTIL", "6305258287", "B003Y7JWZ0", "B001A7GOCA", "B000CEXFYW", "B00008L3UQ", "B0039A9MES", "0792838300", "B0041B77RS", "B00005JOJE", "B002GHHHOM", "B003YCL0Y6", "B000PHX8RA", "B002SJIO4A", "B0013LL2Z2", "B00HRUQB8Q", "B0007CEXUY", "B00H3N3UV8", "B00HT2RTU6", "B00CPTUNZG", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B0000AOX0F", "1558908846", "B00ARWX9NG", "B005FQ2H8W", "B000KGGIV4", "B0045HCJSU", "B00004STDN", "B00AEBB91E", "B001AQMBNC", "B00GX7D5G0", "B002BAW6H2", "B0009X768W", "B0001Z37HM", "B001JFZ118", "B00008G8LY", "B00061QJSK", "B0072GPQ8G", "B009INADRA", "B0001I562I", "B004KPLVV8", "B002BAW6GI", "B00JJOY45U", "B00AEFXIIW", "B0003JAOO0", "B00GJ7CUFG", "B006MFQ4OS", "B00JGR3M80", "B00J4LMHMK", "B0045HCJGC", "B000068MC3", "B00A50PDS4", "B00AZMFJYA", "B002BAW6FY", "B00HXH00YE", "B008L0YMVE", "B0045HCJG2", "B004EXWGHY", "0783229399", "0783232047", "B00003CWU3"], "bought_together": ["B000BOH8Y6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BOH8Y6", "B000KGGIV4", "B000WLU5ZM", "B000QXDCJ2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 249993}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 25.98, "brand": "", "asin": "B000059HAD", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5162DB53QTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Alien Nation"}
{"description": "Father Tedis one of those rare sitcoms that defies categorization--it owes as much to Flann O'Brien and Samuel Beckett as it does to Monty Python--and its blend of satire, character comedy, and anarchic surrealism has made it a cult favorite around the world.Exiled to remote Craggy Island, Father Ted Crilley shares a house with the breathtakingly stupid Father Dougal and the constantly inebriated Father Jack, who has a small vocabulary and a taste for furniture polish. Their housekeeper, Mrs. Doyle, takes care of them with a never-ending supply of tea and sandwiches: \"Go on now, Father, won't you try one? They're diagonal.\" Together they fight boredom by dressing up as Elvis, startling ducks at the fair, and provoking nuns.This DVD contains the entire first season ofFather Ted--six episodes of inspired lunacy including a visit from the excruciatingly dull Father Stone, Mrs. Doyle's solemn recitation of all the bad language in Ted's favorite novel, and the death and resurrection of Father Jack. Packed with great lines and hilarious characters,Father Tedgets better with every viewing.--Simon Leake", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005U8PZ", "B0000796CV", "B0000ALPJL", "B0000DZSYC", "B000EOTUTE", "B002LFPAUC", "B0009FVS8Y", "B002BIULNA", "B0000DZSYB", "B001R3YRGC", "B00BQXTCVS", "B0013XZ6TI", "B000NHG7G6", "B0000ALPJN", "B00D7AM2WO", "B0000A02YG", "B001V7UXG2", "B000BVM1SW", "B00078XGRY", "B002BIULNK", "B0000ALPJM", "B003TY2STU", "B00005V1WP", "B000F7CMSG", "B0006FO5MI", "B0009UZG78", "B000EHQU12", "B0000DZSYD", "B0035JHYQG", "B0009NSCTY", "B001JV5BBC", "B000YIGNKY", "B0002F6BT2", "B0002HOERQ", "B004AV5H3U", "B000068UE9", "B000HC2LXU", "B00HYZ10RQ", "B0000TG49C", "B000GH3PNQ", "B00GAHJO8G", "B000TSTEPK", "B000U1ZV9E", "B000N8UXYC", "B000ION2H6", "B000BPL2EW", "B000AOEMVE", "B0000A02Y9", "B000H5U5MQ", "B004ZJHSYS", "B0000A02Y8", "B00007AP31", "B0001JXP8E", "B0007QS28E", "B00003CX8N", "B002BAW6FE", "B000SINSX0", "B000O7860A", "B00006AUL2"], "bought_together": ["B002LFPAUC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000YIGNKY", "B00005U8PZ", "B0000TWMXY", "B00GD7UO4G"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 35099}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 70.0, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005A1SY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51715RBCBKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Father Ted - Complete Series 1"}
{"description": "It's a good thing Sandra Bullock knows her strengths and weaknesses, because without Bullock as star and producer,Miss Congenialitywould be an insufferable mess as opposed to being a mildly enjoyable trifle that is custom-made for Bullock's established screen persona. Only Bullock's fans could really appreciate this fluff (even then they'll wish its ripe premise had been more intelligently handled), but it's not without some highlights to accompany Bullock's reliable charms. Here she plays clumsy, nerdy FBI agent Gracie Hart, who is given the horrific pseudonym Gracie Lou Freebush (one example of the movie's juvenile tendencies) when assigned to infiltrate a beauty pageant to investigate threats of a terrorist attack.Transforming Bullock from frumpy to stunning is a piece of cake (although she gives pageant coach Michael Caine a run for his money), so the movie's premise is trivial at best. More enjoyable is her character's uncouth disdain for pageant contestants and her mistaken perception that they're all a bunch of bimbos. The movie nicely charts Gracie's realization that her own pageant makeover provides a much-needed ego boost. In addition to Caine's effortless scene-stealing, pageant host William Shatner and organizer Candice Bergen are smart choices for comedic support (Shatner's a perfect Bert Parks wannabe), but the movie desperately needs a credible foundation for its comedy to really pay off. Bullock's bureau boss (Benjamin Bratt) is an unconvincing dimwit, and none of the plotting is as smart as sayBeverly Hills Copin combining procedure with laughs. That leaves Bullock to carry the burden of a comedy that just barely works in her favor.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009KA2OA", "B00005O5CM", "B00005JM55", "6304765266", "B002K0WBXW", "B00081U7HC", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B00003CXSM", "B00006ZXSL", "B00008NRI7", "B002VECM6S", "B00007E2F5", "B0006GANOQ", "B00AEBB8NS", "B00003CXMP", "B0000524E5", "B00AEFY99O", "B00006FMUW", "B000HEWEE4", "B002NZK5V4", "B000YDBPAM", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00AEBB8R4", "B000CEV3M8", "B002O3Z50G", "B004SEUJK0", "B000J4QW7W", "B00E8RKHWW", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B00AEFYM2S", "B000209KMW", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00006ZXSK", "B0045HCJJ4", "B00447L4KA", "B00AMEZDJW", "B00008WJD6", "B0000897EG", "B000QUU4LY", "B000MQC9H4", "B00AEFXYOA", "B0000DIXDR", "B000XT1P3E", "0800177258", "0783225504", "B000NA1WE0", "6305236569", "B000023VTP", "B000FO0A9W", "B002SYAGNC", "B001ECDVK4", "B00003CXFV", "B00AEFYF2K", "B000J103OI", "B00005JG6N", "B0036TGSIK", "B00466HN7M", "B00000G3PA", "B0000AOV4I", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFY5TI", "B0015I2RT8", "B001ECDVJU", "B004SIP8JI", "B00005KAQP", "B000ELJAEM", "B0049TC88U", "B002NZK5UU", "B00006ZXSQ", "B00008G8M4", "B004SIP9RO", "6305212112", "B000A343RI", "B004SIP9X8", "0783225733", "6302077818", "B002GHHHP6", "B002GIBVWA", "B00AEBB9WI", "0800141806", "B000683VI4", "B00795C5X4", "B002NZK5RS", "B00003CXTA", "B000JYW5BE", "B00005JM9Q", "B004EPZ070", "B00AEFXZJE", "B003L20IHE", "B007L6VMDK", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00386EZKE", "B000CCBCAI", "B00007BKVC", "0783235070", "B00AEFXWXI", "B000CEV3KU", "B00005BCKF", "B00AEBB8YW", "B0006N2EZ0"], "bought_together": ["B00005O5CM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000NA1WE0", "B003PIUIJC", "6304765266", "B00005O5CM"]}, "price": 9.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 77252}, "asin": "B00005AAA9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514V9KPFJRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Miss Congeniality"}
{"description": "One of the most influential silent films of all time, F.W. Murnau's  street-drama tragedy (of an aging hotel porter who loses his job to a younger,  more dashing man and suffers the humiliation of being demoted to washroom  attendant) is a compendium of silent film techniques handled with a new  sophistication. When the hearty, rather pompous Emil Jannings loses the  dignified uniform of his station, he transforms into a scared little man  scurrying through the shadows to hide his demotion from friends and family.  Murnau captures the humiliation and calamitous fallout from the demotion (he  loses not just his self-respect, but the esteem of his neighbors and even his  apartment) in haunting, expressionistic images that magnify the petty events  into tragic melodrama. The story seems a little extreme even for the genre but  it's never less than a harrowing, subjective experience, even with the rather  fanciful happy ending tacked on the end of it. Most famously, Murnau throws the  camera into motion--one of his most famous shots takes the viewers up an  elevator, through the grand hotel lobby, and out the revolving glass door in a  single smooth shot--and it hasn't stopped moving since.Kino's DVD features a wonderful score by Timothy Brock and the Olympia Chamber Orchestra as well as the credits montage sequence from the German release. Production stills are also included among the supplements.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001M9ELJY", "B00006JMQG", "0780022343", "B0083Q4JXM", "B0040QYROA", "B00005QW59", "B000HT3QBO", "B00006JMQH", "B000VUQ4HW", "B003N2CVRC", "B00EO2I6RO", "6305131104", "B00007CVS8", "B000V7HFL4", "B00GG0NABE", "B000FS9FLW", "B00064AEWY", "B000093NQY", "B0009S4IKG", "B00180R06I", "B00005BHW6", "B00005QW58", "B000FS9FLM", "B00D9BNONW", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B0000B1A1J", "B0036SPDEG", "B00EO2I6W4", "B00917IPOQ", "B00006JMQI", "630521123X", "B0012KHTEC", "B00HE010LC", "B0002DCHQA", "B00005O5CA", "B00D9BNOKK", "B003ZYU3TG", "B0000B1O9L", "B00008WJBZ", "6305186774", "B00393SG0G", "6305744114", "B000FS9FLC", "B000MNOXZ8", "B00000IOKV", "B009RWRINE", "B002NTDX6O", "B00065GX64", "B0001UZZS6", "B003TTZTC8", "B00027JYLC", "B0012KOM6K", "B00004W229", "B005HK13OK", "B0082LUEFA", "B005J7K9CI", "B00D8HNRBG", "B000056N7V", "B00JGR3M26", "B000TEUSI6", "B000025RE7", "B002U6DVQ2", "6305999872", "B00005JKGO", "B00005RF2C", "B000N2HBIO", "B000094J73", "B005KQVE1S", "B000BB14I0", "B00393SFWU", "B00005QAPH", "B0013D8LY0", "B00005JKSC", "B00AEFZDNA", "B00005ABVH", "B000V3IX82", "B00005JKGX", "6305081034", "B00000ILEU", "B000063K2Q", "B001E18222", "B00005M2C7", "B00005UQ7Q", "B00000J11G", "B0007989Y8", "B00HE011DE", "B004NWPY7A", "B0009S4IH4", "B0056ANHCC", "B00917IPSW", "B004WPYO7E", "B007N5YJPC", "B00009ME9Z", "B0035ECHIG", "B00092ZLEY", "B000W9TTSS", "B0063E00HU", "B0047P5FTK", "B00005JNGA", "B005ARYF1S"], "bought_together": ["B001M9ELJY", "B00006JMQG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0012KHTEC", "B0040QYROA", "B001M9ELK8", "B00D9BNONW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 321592}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 17.96, "brand": "Kino International", "asin": "B00005ASOR", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513SAHNT4AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Last Laugh"}
{"description": "Robert Lee King directs this wacky, campy fusion of teenaged surfer flicks and slasher sagas. Impossibly perky Florence (Lauren Ambrose) doesn't quite fit in at her thoroughly square high school in her seaside Southern California town -- that is, until she happens upon a band of ultra-hip surfer dudes. Renaming herself \"Chicklet,\" she tries her gosh-darnedest to be the sole girl riding the waves with the group led by suave Kanaka (Thomas Gibson). While adopting her surfer alter ego, Florence soon discovers that other less pleasant personalities emerge when confronted with the sight of polka dots. One called Anne Bowman is a tough, \"experienced\" older lady, while the other, Tylene, is a stereotypical sassy black woman. Blacking out whenever these other personalities take over, Florence becomes increasingly worried that she is responsible for a series of grizzly murders. Of course, she is far from the only suspicious character in her oceanside community -- there's B-movie star Bettina Barnes (Kimberly Davies), Swedish exchange student Lars (Matt Keeslar), and Florence's own unnervingly-perfect mom (Beth Broderick). This film was adapted from a popular off-Broadway play written by Charles Busch. ~ Jonathan Crow, Rovi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007VF22S", "B00019GHQQ", "B000GG4XYW", "B00009MEB8", "0802137857", "B00JVLGL7U", "B00K1L4NBU", "B000VFIDPI", "B00I4CWIVU", "B00004X0Q7", "B00KCTG4PO", "B00DJYKEQ4", "B001UV4XGU", "B000QUEQ4K", "B00IA7MFEO", "B00DOZNGTK", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B006M3M5FM", "B002I41KNW", "B0018M6J90", "B00000I6D4", "B00ET2ODTE", "0780629167", "B00FQPLYYK", "0780628306", "B00GB0ORJ8", "B004HHX9OQ", "B0024FAG44", "B0052SO0J2", "B00CBFB8SU", "B007V6ON9A", "B000929UOQ", "B00JM5CAHA", "B0000560PU", "B00004XPPI", "B0001HAGRE", "B00005QW5X", "B00GHP8SH4", "B0000C3I8I", "B001Y7CVXC", "B0013527L6", "B0042L0OFE", "B0000DD75N", "B005S2F8LQ", "B00FPM1BME", "076784257X", "B00GJ7CUFG", "B000F6II1M", "B005XB8T68", "B00FYL08RK", "B00JJRLG7G", "B005KBP07W", "B00HRJVHKE", "B00276L4TG", "B00EL6ACBQ", "B003THSXJ6", "B00199PPP6", "B00005JLD1", "B000BYRCQU", "0767827740", "B0006Z2LJC", "B00344EAMS", "B00009YXHG", "B0000714BP", "B0042FUHUM", "006198583X", "B00007ELF9", "B00HW3L9MG", "B00IXD2N1K", "B00FB349R6", "B00D2UMHIS", "B00GSMZ3I8", "B00ESZZOOK", "B00008UALE", "B008YAPR7E", "B00005LQ0T", "B002AT4JNI", "B00CERJJ68", "B0080BFWE0", "B00IBQ5M1W", "B00I3C1T6G", "6305847045", "B000ICL3L0", "B0053TWVZA", "B002DQSKMY", "B004OBQDCK", "B001D5C1OO", "B00G3MXSW6", "B00EMAGKNU", "B00005COWD", "B000CS45NS", "0062196243", "B003THSXJG", "B00I04SVV8", "B00005NGAF", "B00CBFB8WQ", "B001QYY4JM", "B000TEUSMC"], "bought_together": ["B0007VF22S", "B00019GHQQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007VF22S", "B00019GHQQ", "B001UV4XGU", "B008FYZHPG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 35295}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 16.17, "brand": "Strand Releasing", "asin": "B00005ASPE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HWNABM37L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Psycho Beach Party"}

{"description": "Raymond De Felitta's Sundance 2000 Audience Winner is a sweet little romantic drama set in the insular Italian and Irish neighborhoods of 1956 Staten Island. Narrated with the conversational ease of a bar story, it stars Michael Rispoli as Buddy, blue-collar Italian American with big dreams, a golden voice, and a history of failed business schemes. His latest scheme involves turning a two-story firetrap into a bar with an upstairs apartment, but first he has to evict the squatters he inherited with the house: an abandoned young Irish mother (Kelly Macdonald) and her half-black child. Guilty over his hardhearted decision, he sets them up in an apartment and essentially adopts them. An unlikely friendship begins in clashes and verbal fireworks and turns into a gentle romance while Buddy confronts his own prejudice and smothering cultural values.De Felitta is uncharacteristically generous to both his clannish working-class chorus and Buddy's wife Estelle (Kathrine Narducci, fromThe Sopranos), who undermines her spouse's efforts and ridicules his ambition out of sheer conformism. Rispoli, by contrast, is accepting and warm as a guy hungry for his piece of the American dream, and Macdonald's scrappy single mom is full of Irish dander that melts into a romantic sparkle and loving support.Two Family Houseis inspired by the true story of writer-director De Felitta's uncle, and there's an engaging modesty and loving understanding in this portrait of one man's rebellion against the stifling values and judgmental intolerance of his community.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 286849}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Two Family House", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0036TGT8Y", "6305803765", "B007K7IBTI", "B000YRY8BG", "B000A59PL0", "B00606P0BM", "B0002V7SOS", "B007NE08JO", "B00006SFKM", "1573624055", "B00004YRGT", "B000UX6TKM", "B00004STRF", "B000FDFSGI", "B001E6JC26", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B000CEV3P0", "B00606OZWM", "B007K7IBVQ", "B00441GYZ6", "B00003CXQ4", "B0007IO740", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B0009PBLU4", "B005D82VM4", "B00H9L26AA", "B000A2W1X2", "B002KGVB7S", "B008JFUNKU", "B0003JAO7C", "B0006FO8PC", "B000FIMG7C", "B0000A2ZO0", "B000IFQLG4", "B001NPD9RM", "B0017YWUS8", "B00005KCB1", "B00AEBB8SS", "B00G15MDI0", "B0064MT1FI", "B00003L9CK", "B00DZP1BVO", "630542828X", "B00AEFZ3XU", "0790742071", "B00EV4EUT8", "B001P3SA94", "B000069I1W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0036TGT8Y", "6305803765", "B005LAIIPS"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DSE4ZSVPL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "B00005B6KZ"}

{"description": "\"Lose weight and tone your body in just six weeks!\" Despite the claims on the back cover ofEmergency Workout, you shouldn't expect to look like gorgeous Minna Lessig, former Ms. Fitness USA and National Fitness Champion, in that time, but you should expect to have fun getting into shape with these two well-designed, high-energy, 30-minute workouts.Remember the pre-hip-hop era of aerobic dance when we were doing cha-cha, salsa, mambo, grapevines, and other hip-swinging, feel-good moves that kept our heart rates and moods up without taxing our minds terribly much? That's what Lessig gives us in the aerobic segment. The dance moves are just challenging enough to be fun and to give us a sense of accomplishment without being a major learning endeavor. Lessig teaches the routines smoothly and expertly, one move at a time. Her two female assistants, their faces animated, seem to be having a great time, too.The second workout is a nonstop weight segment using dumbbells. Lessig's routine is an interesting mix of combination moves, such as biceps curls with lunges, or leg extensions with lateral raises, sometimes involving balance. The only problem is that you have no time to change weights between muscle groups, so you have to go light. Each workout has its own warm-up and cool-down, so you can alternate them on different days, or blitz yourself by doing the whole hour. A sample low-calorie diet menu is included.--Joan Price", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 487852}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 4.69, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005BIG5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BM9KAGS1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Minna - Emergency Workout [VHS]"}

SANDRA BULLOCK (\"Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood,\" \"Miss Congeniality\"), stars as Cassie Mayweather, the seasoned homicide detective and crime scene specialist assigned to the case along with her new partner San Kennedy (BEN CHAPLIN - \"Lost Souls,\" \"The Thin Red Line\"). The two dectectives make their way through microscopic hints of evidence, which seem to indicate a random act of violence, but Cassie has a gut feeling that there is more to this murder than meets the eye.

{"description": "The key component of this Vista Series DVD is a six-part documentary about the making of the film from idea to theatrical release. M. Night Shyamalan talks at length about the film and his filmmaking technique in this exclusive one-hour feature. The approach is straightforward but at times is as self-congratulatory as a marketing puff piece. Because Shyamalan works so leanly, the five deleted scenes are excellent, including a chilling scene from the film's final act. Also included are storyboard comparisons and another glimpse of one of Shyamalan's early home movies.Signsis the first of the Vista Series to be a single disc and the extras seem light, but there are only a couple of quibbles: the director again does not provide a commentary track and there is no DTS soundtrack.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004BZIY", "B00064LJVE", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00003CXQA", "B000JLTR8Q", "B004SIP92O", "B00AEFYYH6", "B003102JDC", "B00005JNTI", "B00000G3PA", "B002GHHHKQ", "B003Y5H4SO", "B0002DB54A", "B00008G8M4", "B00AEBBA2W", "B0000648X0", "630471193X", "B002O3Z50G", "B00011CZRE", "B000PHVZNE", "B0087ZG7HK", "B002NZK5SM", "B00004XPPG", "B00005JOC9", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B0021L8UXA", "0783225733", "B0006L0LOS", "B0006SGYL0", "B000NOKFHQ", "B005LAIHXQ", "0800177029", "6305767866", "B00004TS0G", "6304711891", "B00AEFY3MC", "B002GIBVVG", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000U1ZV8K", "B00005JNY3", "B00070FX5U", "B00AEBB8NI", "B0002KVUKM", "B00008G8LY", "B000F6IOAM", "B00005JN0T", "B00AEBBA36", "B002LMV7R0", "B002NZK5UU", "B0013FDM7E", "B002O3Z4WK", "B0068FZ0GK", "B00015YVDG", "B000LC55F2", "B00001ZWUS", "B002GHHHL0", "B000BTJDGC", "B000EHRVOW", "B0087ZG7J8", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00005JN2Z", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEFXSLE", "B00019073K", "B00005LC4D", "B00005JL78", "B00IBKXSKA", "B004EPYZPS", "B00000JDIQ", "B00AEBB9WI", "B000RIWAVW", "0780618548", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00005JN0W", "B00AEFXNLY", "6305428115", "0767811100", "0800141601", "B00AEFXT1S", "0780631536", "B00000IQC4", "B004P7CNUY", "B001GCUO02", "B002AS464Q", "B00003CWS3", "B00006FDCD", "B000FS9FCG", "B00005JKZH", "B000067FP8", "B000K7VHQE", "B00BEIYG98", "B00005JNNT", "B000068NNU", "B000XT1P4S", "B0087ZG7PW", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B002I9Z8BM", "B00AEFXKUI", "B0010X73ZG", "B00003CXIP"], "bought_together": ["B00004BZIY", "B004SIP92O"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004BZIY", "B00386EZUY", "B000QUU4M8", "B0000VCZK2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 11300}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.99, "brand": "Touchstone Video", "asin": "B00005JL3T", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51c02AOAyCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Signs"}

{"description": "The plethora of extras on this two-disc set are worth your time. There are several well-produced segments on the physical aspects of the film highlighted by a tour of the vast Cinecitt&#xE0; Studio sets with director Martin Scorsese and production designer Dante Ferretti (with a 360-degree-view feature to boot). Historian Luc Sante introduces you to the Five Corners area in New York circa the mid-19th century, and there's a vintage vocabulary guide (from the 1859 edition ofThe Rogue's Lexicon). Even though it was made as a \"puff piece\" for the movie, the Discovery Channel show \"Uncovering the Real Gangs of New York\" is an informative half-hour on the film's historical background. There's another espresso double-shot from a Scorsese commentary track. Not recorded traditionally as he watches the movie, the track pieces together thoughts from the director including some recorded in an NPR interview. This allows Scorsese to be even more focused, dealing with the history of the time and his own 30-year struggle to make the film. One serious demerit for stretching the feature film over both discs, which most likely had to be done with having both Dolby 5.1 and DTS tracks along with the commentary on the long film.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000M341QE", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00080ZG10", "B00AEBB8NI", "B006OFN0SE", "B00005JLSB", "B000C20VPA", "B000MZHW40", "B001N44BVQ", "B002ZG980U", "B000P0J09M", "B00049QQHI", "B004SIP8ZM", "0767830555", "6305313687", "B0006GAOJA", "B00008975Z", "B0016Q2D66", "B0000DI87S", "B00008DP4C", "B00011CZRE", "B000P0J0EW", "B00004XPPB", "B008R65XYC", "B005LAIIJY", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000C20VRS", "B004SIP95G", "B000286RP2", "B002CPMB9O", "B002T9H2LA", "0307388980", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000A7DVR2", "B00AEFXKUI", "B008MILL8W", "B00AEBB9F0", "B001EZE5DI", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004FQX5B6", "B002QEHPQU", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00H9KKGTO", "B004SIP6GI", "B002VWNIEA", "B0001FGBUW", "B000A2UBN4", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00003CWM3", "B008D1Q1VA", "B00005V9HH", "B003ASLJQI", "B003ASLJQS", "B007SPPANM", "B000093FLA", "B00003CXZ4", "B00004XPPG", "B00001ZWUS", "B000H5TH20", "B000FKO5QK", "B002ZG99N6", "6304711905", "B0018CMJSU", "0767817710", "B009AMANBA", "079284646X", "B000FS9FCG", "B000065U1N", "B00AEBB89W", "B000P0J0AG", "B004SIP6QI", "B001QTXM5Y", "B004499LWG", "0783227906", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000J4P9P8", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00AEBB95K", "B000NOKFHQ", "B002VWNICC", "B00009W5CA", "B004U7MR14", "B004AOECXI", "B00003CXRM", "0783231202", "B000069HZP", "0783229526", "B001JIE7JC", "B00005221M", "B000N6TX1I", "B00005JMJG", "B000N3SRO0", "B00003CXWV", "B00005JMYI", "B003HKN52U", "0790732238", "B00004U103", "B003UESJHO", "B000P0J09C"], "bought_together": ["B000M341QE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002ZG980U", "B000P0J09M", "B0013FXWU6", "B00H9KKGTO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 46244}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.89, "brand": "Miramax", "asin": "B00005JKN9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516W0haa4aL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gangs of New York (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "WithThe Return of the King, the greatest fantasy epic in film history draws to a grand and glorious conclusion. Director Peter Jackson's awe-inspiring adaptation of the Tolkien classicThe Lord of the Ringscould never fully satisfy those who remain exclusively loyal to Tolkien's expansive literature, but as a showcase for physical and technical craftsmanship it is unsurpassed in pure scale and ambition, setting milestone after cinematic milestone as the brave yet charmingly innocent Hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood) continues his mission to Mordor, where he is destined to destroy the soul-corrupting One Ring of Power in the molten lava of Mount Doom. While the heir to the kingdom of Men, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), endures the massive battle at Minas Tirith with the allegiance of the elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom), dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and the great wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), Frodo and stalwart companion Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) must survive the schizoid deceptions of Gollum, who remains utterly convincing as a hybrid of performance (by Andy Serkis) and subtly nuanced computer animation.Jackson and cowriters Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens have much ground to cover; that they do so with intense pacing and epic sweep is impressive enough, but by investing greater depth and consequence in the actions of fellow Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), they ensure thatReturn of the Kingmaintains the trilogy's emphasis on intimate fellowship. While several major characters appear only briefly, and one (Christopher Lee's evil wizard, Saruman) relegated entirely to the extended version on DVD, Jackson is to be commended for his editorial acumen; like Legolas the archer, his aim as a filmmaker is consistently true, and he remains faithful to Tolkien's overall vision. IfReturnsuffers from too many endings, as some critic suggested, it's only because the epic's conclusion is so loyally inclusive of the actors--most notably Astin--who gave it such strength to begin with. By ending theLOTRtrilogy with noble integrity and faith in the power of imaginative storytelling,The Return of the King, like its predecessors, will stand as an adventure for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B002ZG980U", "B002PMV9FG", "B008UZA8FY", "B001NGML48", "B00005JM5E", "B001GZ6QC4", "B005COPWZW", "B008M4C1EO", "B00HFFE8HE", "039548930X", "B000W7F5SS", "B000I0RQVI", "B002VWNIDG", "B000E6EK2Y", "B001BYMX4A", "B004M1A21K", "B007K3JFUQ", "B001DHXT20", "B001UV4XHY", "0345325818", "B003Y5H54W", "B00005JNJV", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000A3XY5A", "B004LWZWGA", "B000U7WV1Y", "B005LXQLRW", "B001OQCV6A", "B000E8M0VA", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000EHRVMY", "0618640150", "B003ZK99NQ", "B0013FDM7E", "B00005JPH2", "B000UNYK4E", "B009JBWOU0", "B00003CX5P", "B00008G8M5", "B00GKOJ98E", "B004LWZW42", "B000H30B2C", "B000P0J0C4", "B00CZDLGDU", "B000M341QE", "B00008G8M4", "B000FKO5QK", "B00HWWUQYY", "B007SPPANM", "B008JFUO72", "B001DJLD1M", "0345538374", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00005JKCH", "B004SIP9U6", "B000YGGNMO", "B00E5I2M9K", "0618126988", "B005OCFGTO", "B00E8S2JZ4", "6305313687", "B004AKCME8", "B0002KVUKM", "B000AARKOO", "B0006GAO5Y", "B000K7VHQ4", "B002ZG997C", "B00AHTYI5M", "B008JFUS0U", "B0042MEQVG", "B00275EGWY", "B00E9PMML2", "B008UZDXEW", "B004SIP7F8", "B00116GEJS", "B00003CXI1", "B003ZKBELG", "B003Y5H5EW", "B000V4UFZK", "B0007PLLBU", "B001DTPZNY", "B002O3Z50Q", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000LP6KNU", "B005G4TJUC", "B00AW0KHTM", "B002ZG97YM", "054792819X", "B00AEFXZJE", "B0000YEEGM", "B002IPFWTE", "B001ECQ75A", "B000065U1N", "B0051MKNV8", "B000W796OM", "B00J49R1BY"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HFFE8HE", "B00003CWT6", "B00005JKZV", "B00BEZTMFY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1589}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JKZY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HS7iSFv5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)"}

{"description": "As the second season aired, the decline in TV ratings and the tepid  sales ofKelly Osbourne's albumindicated that the Osbourne family's 15 minutes were just about up. But this  two-disc set is an indispensable time-capsule keepsake of that brief and shining  moment when Ozzy and his family put their indelible stamp on pop culture as the  stars of the first reality sitcom. For addledheavy-metal pioneer  Ozzy, his fiercely devoted wife and manager Sharon, and two (of three) of  their children--petulant misfit Jack and the more flamboyant pink-haired  Kelly--it was a very good year. They were MTV's top-rated series ever. They graced  magazine covers. They were championed by no less a moral arbiter than Dan  Quayle. Even President George W. Bush got into the act, toasting Ozzy at the  annual Washington Press Club soiree: \"Ozzy, mom loves your stuff.\"The  Osbournesis the kind of series for which the phrase \"instantly addictive\"  was coined. The idea seemed positively batty: Chronicle the lives of the  Osbournes as they settle in to their new Beverly Hills home. They ain't the  Clampetts, as the crates marked \"Dead Things\" indicates. Persistent use of theFword and other obscenities (not bleeped on the uncensored DVD) aside,  the Osbournes at heart are a close-knit, loving family. Or, as Ozzy so tenderly  puts it, \"I love you more than life itself, but you're all f------ mad.\" Episode  4 bears him out, as Sharon and Jack declare war on their noisy next-door  neighbors with airborne foodstuffs. These 10 endlessly repeatable episodes are  enhanced by this features-heavy DVD; among its most inspired extras is an \"Ozzy  translator.\" The first season ofThe Osbourneswas a lightning-in-a- bottle phenomenon whose success has yet to be duplicated, not by the shameless  Anna Nicole, not by clueless Liza, not even by the Osbournes themselves.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000A2ZSN", "B0001I55LU", "B0000CBXZ7", "B000X7HFA8", "B005DJ62NM", "B00013RC34", "B000H5U5U8", "B00062IDZQ", "B0002PYS5Q", "B0002V7OJC", "B0008KLV8M", "B000CNE0RY", "144021400X", "B000BDH6AI", "B000NNK4DW", "B000FKO3HQ", "B000ICLRL6", "B000VWQTVG", "B0085KGGLY", "B0016QNSBU", "B000WTVZIK", "B000068TOX", "B0013D8M0I", "B00AF3OEJ0", "B000BITUY8", "B00561BN1S", "B00561BNAE", "B000HT3862", "B00769RH0O", "B000OHZKYU", "B000A88F22", "B00004YRI4", "B000063DFS", "B0007KIFXW", "0446569909", "0446569895", "B0002V7OJM", "B000GG4Y0U", "B00006F89V", "B000GG4Y1O", "B000KJU1MS", "B000S2XD36", "B0040LAH80", "B003JMJ5T8", "B000002B3Q", "B000002KET", "B00008NV4M", "B009M4KT8I", "B005ZEM91Y", "B005DJ62NC", "1906002371", "B000JMKKFY", "B000AA304S", "B00BTHWFBK", "B0035G5IQM", "B000002KB8", "B000FEBWTE", "B00FKIB3XA", "B001CY5N1E", "B0071BY2CS", "B002MJV7JA", "0743466209", "B0082JR26Q", "B005FIXA90", "B000SQFBZ0", "B0001XAODE", "B00005JLZN", "B000002KDO", "B000B5XOWU", "B000KLQUMQ", "B000I0RNVQ", "B000002KGG", "B00004W4UD", "B000AM4P9K", "B000FSME2Y", "B00BUWD7E8", "B000SULWKO", "B007CO5E30", "B003NKU9XM"], "bought_together": ["B0000A2ZSN", "B0001I55LU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0077LRGKW", "B0001I55LU", "B0000A2ZSN", "B000CNE0RY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 142228}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 28.99, "brand": "Lions Gate", "asin": "B00005JLBW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Qym1VF47L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Osbournes: Season 1 (Uncensored)"}

{"description": "James Bond DVDs have in general been pretty loaded, butDie Another Dayraises the bar with a two-disc set featuring dynamic DTS 6.1 ES and Dolby Digital 5.1 EX sound that makes good use of the rear speakers. The first commentary track is by Pierce Brosnan and Rosamund Pike (who plays villain Miranda Frost). They weren't together at the time, so their comments are spliced into one track. Brosnan has a good time watching and is proud of the film but also doesn't take himself too seriously (\"They don't teach you this stuff at drama school: 'OK, now you're going to be electrocuted by the bad guy.'\"). Self-proclaimed \"Bond novice\" Pike also is proud of the film and says she's annoyed by people who question whether there's still a need for Bond. On the second commentary track, director Lee Tamahori and producer Michael G. Wilson chat about topics as diverse as casting, Bond lore, and product placements. For more Bond lore, don't overlook the trivia track, which offers pop-up tidbits about the filming and tips on the inside jokes.The centerpiece of the second disc is the 80-minute \"InsideDie Another Day\" documentary, which is a set of featurettes strung together. Topics include the opening surfing sequence; the scenes set in North Korea and Cuba (including Halle Berry's bikini tribute to Ursula Andress); the ice palace; post-production elements such as computer graphics, editing, and music; the car battle (finding strong ice was the key safety issue); and the passing of the \"Q\" torch from Desmond Llewellyn to John Cleese.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000NIBURQ", "B000M53GM2", "B000RPCK1U", "B000NDEXPM", "B000M53GMW", "B000RPCK1K", "B000RPCK24", "B000NIBURG", "B000M53GLS", "B000RPCK1A", "B000NIBUR6", "B000M53GN6", "B001PPLIEG", "B001R10BN2", "B00AQSN7HE", "B000RPCK0Q", "B000M53GNG", "B000NIBUS0", "B000NDEXPC", "B00004RG62", "B000M53GMC", "B007REV4T8", "B00004WEJZ", "B00005JL0I", "B009PN18R2", "B008YAPQX4", "B004BR7XLM", "B009PN3OD8", "B003QO8TOQ", "B000HRMAPE", "B000VNMMR0", "B0000BYRO7", "B00AZFECL8", "B000EGDB10", "B004EPYZUS", "B0004Z33EQ", "B00AIBZMD6", "B009A87Z6U", "B009RO9LKK", "B000SK5Z70", "B00003CXMV", "6305657947", "B00005JLYW", "B00005JN2Z", "B00023B1LC", "B005PTYP70", "B00008G8M4", "B00005JNJV", "B00000G3PA", "B000P0J06K", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B002ZG9864", "0792844068", "B00005JKIP", "0792166736", "0790732238", "B00AS1Q93S", "B003Q6D2B4", "B0002I84N0", "B000U1ZV8K", "B008JFURII", "B00JA3RVG4", "B000MZHW40", "B00026ZG10", "0790732149", "B000FKO3HG", "B000AP04FG", "B008JFUS0U", "B0001FGC1U", "B00005JMQW", "B009L6UDUG", "B00AVWIQZS", "B0013BM63O", "B00005JLRT", "B00E5I2M6I", "B001TK80C0", "B00AZMFJYA", "B0007KZQAM", "B002ZG999U", "B00BUAEYVK", "B009A87ZQU", "B000P0J06U", "B008JFUO72", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00003CY0V", "B00E5I2MCM", "B0036TGSR6", "B003AWRMBU", "B0000BYRO9", "B008JFUNHI", "B00177YA1K", "6304696221", "B0021L8V0M", "B00006G8FD", "B000UR9T8C", "B002GNOSFM", "B003UESJFQ", "B0006L0LOS", "B000AYELVU"], "bought_together": ["B000NIBURQ", "B000M53GM2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000M53GM2", "B000RPCK1U", "B000M53GN6", "B000RPCK0Q"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 38500}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "MGM", "asin": "B00005JLBE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51kgPWMuVFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Die Another Day (Widescreen Special Edition)"}

{"description": "Disney changes how they have been delivering their recent theatrical hits and improves the DVD experience. Gone is the creators' commentary track; instead there's a robust 45-minute feature on the making of the film that opens up the audience to older kids interested in the craft. The commentary track is for laughs with the MacKenzie Brothers-influenced moose Rutt & Tuke (SCTValumnus Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas) having a good old time; it's a treat for adults as kids. Also, the traditional still gallery has been replaced by a deft 10-minute display of the various artwork, narrated by the artists. All the deleted scenes are voiced and in various forms of animation; additionally there is a Phil Collins song that was not used in the film. Disney reaches into Pixar's bag of tricks with \"outtakes\" that kids will love, along with the two above-average set-top games. Connoisseurs should appreciate the options: both 2.35 and 1.77 widescreen formats are offered as well as 5.1 Dolby and DTS sound.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FQISFS", "B00029LO0Y", "B00005RDSQ", "B00005JLR2", "B000AAF1TU", "B001O5LVPI", "B001ILFUD2", "B00005TN8K", "B000DWMYQ8", "B0084IHVUC", "B000AAF1U4", "B0084IHVGG", "B003E66Y3E", "B0034GK74G", "B00003CXG7", "B00CTNYLQA", "B004ZBACOE", "B00AO686JC", "B000G75AZC", "B0000AOX0O", "B000L22SG6", "B00007LVCM", "B0084IHVN4", "B00004R99S", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B0007PIDBQ", "B000089G5O", "B000GW8U1I", "B000ROAK2W", "B000B8QG4A", "B000056H26", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B003H9M1Q2", "B003RACGZM", "B0002YLCOM", "B000YERP2S", "B00CUDD0C0", "B0000E32WJ", "B00CQRN3QI", "B0007KTBIU", "B000B8QG3G", "B0000VV4W2", "B000BITUVG", "B0001I561E", "B000HWZ4Q6", "B00024I2Z4", "B00009YXAW", "B00003CXB4", "B001FAFO3W", "B00EV1YZ96", "B0007Z9R0M", "B0006JMLRK", "B003E66Y84", "B000063V8M", "B0000524D0", "B001OMU6UM", "B00003CXCQ", "B001ILFUDC", "B000VBJEEG", "B00006LPHB", "B0034JKZ86", "B00005T7H3", "B003ZHVJGO", "B00004R99F", "B000050MN3", "B000096IAI", "B00000JGOQ", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00005T7H7", "B0013ND30M", "B00335EQ0E", "B0001I55VA", "B008YWY0HK", "6305161887", "B000H7JCK0", "B000F48D5U", "B00AFEX83C", "B004G600A4", "B00004R99Y", "B0012EM5D8", "B00004R99H", "B001FTIJS0", "B004A8ZX0K", "B0006UEVT0", "B004HO6I4M", "B000B8QFYG", "B00CHVJODE", "B007MDB6L0", "B00E9ZATJO", "B000035Z48", "B0024NSFYY", "B00005JNQS", "B0052OPJ1E", "B002ZG97YM", "B001NCDFTW", "B0001I55W4", "B0039N74CW", "B0000764FF", "B000LRJD64", "B00005JNS0"], "bought_together": ["B000FQISFS", "B000AAF1TU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00CTNYLQA", "B000OLGCI4", "B00CWM58WY", "B001O5LVPI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6077}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.96, "brand": "Disney", "asin": "B00005JMFH", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61LoOHu0mzL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Brother Bear (Two-Disc Special Edition)"}

Dr. Tess Coleman (the hilarious Jamie Lee Curtis) and her teenage daughter Anna (rockin' Lindsay Lohan) have one thing in common -- they don't relate to each other on anything. Not clothes or men or Anna's passion to be in a rock band. Nothing. Then one night a little mystic mayhem changes their lives and they wake up to the biggest freak-out ever. Tess and Anna are trapped inside each other's body! But Tess's wedding is Saturday and the two must find a way to switch back -- fast! Literally forced to walk in each other's shoes, will they gain respect and understanding for the other's point of view?

{"description": "Writer/director Neil LaBute (Possession, Your Friends & Neighbors) has created another boldly original movie that is as fascinating as it is unsettling. When nerdy Adam (Paul Rudd) meets Evelyn (Rachel Weisz), a sexy and confrontational art student, his predictable life seems to change overnight. But when Adam's brash best friend, Phil (Fred Weller), and his fiancee, Jenny (Gretchen Mol), meet Evelyn, the sparks begin to fly. Phil doesn't like the new Adam, while Jenny seems a little too interested in Adam's new look. Soon everyone is caught in a circle of passion, temptation and betrayal that is oddly funny and totally unexpected.", "related": {"also_bought": ["088145222X", "0767806786", "B00005NGAG", "B0000AMU7A", "B000GRUMSM", "B000NY0YKE", "B000A3XYIM", "B0001ME5GC", "B00109KN0M", "B00008G7UH", "B00005JMIJ", "B0000A9GHI", "B000EDWKX8", "B0000TG95G", "B0016MJ6HY", "B009GIGY3E", "B000092OME", "B0006FO8E8", "B0014GI6I2", "B00CX7OW1G", "B0015U0QVW", "B0002XNT1C", "B008K1PYIE", "B003EYVXXW", "B00006AUIH", "B00D3DJIG8", "B000LPS4L6", "057121150X", "B000I2J736", "B001RJ1Y62", "B00FRILRW0", "B00005QCVN", "1557830991", "B004SUDQ22", "B00005JMON", "B00003CXQ4", "B0023TCWE8", "B006DHATF0", "B00005ASOO", "B00005JL57", "B00AEFYC96", "B00CFHEFKM", "B004SUDQC2", "B00C7BZZ32", "B00000JGOI", "1559362413", "B0002JZT5A", "B003KGBISO", "B000I2JDEO", "B003O7I6SE", "B00AQSN67A", "0802145655", "B00005JNZU", "B002GHHHN8", "B0000ZMGWK", "B0002B15ZG", "6305801142", "B000CQLZ0Q", "0767835093", "B001E95ZNS", "B004499LX0", "B0081FSMQU", "B00007ELES", "B0000A2ZU3", "B00005JMWP", "B0028S10XS", "B00004Y87P", "B000MMMTBY", "0822223945", "6304698747", "B000286RNE", "B0016Q2D66", "B004UXUWEC", "B00005JKJA", "B0002KQNKE", "B00ARX2VZW", "B000S0GYRU", "B00DL46ZN8", "6305327068", "B000069HZP", "B00562D3Y2", "6305504024", "B00A3A3V0I", "B000EPFCPE", "B001GKJ2E8", "B009POCG0Y", "B00ADRYCWC"], "bought_together": ["088145222X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["088145222X", "0767806786", "B00008G7UH", "B00109KN0M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 52011}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.99, "brand": "WEISZ,RACHEL", "asin": "B00005JMBQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZZZVT6BWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Shape of Things"}

In addition to the various goofy outtakes (in which  Cate Blanchett curses adorably as her rifle misfires), the DVD includes  three different versions of the movie's ending, which offer an educational  glimpse into the decision-making process that shapes a movie's emotional  impact.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000F8O2QU", "B00009RDG9", "B001NFNFIK", "B0011V7PSC", "B0000TANUI", "B00005JH9M", "B000189LE2", "B00A92MF6Q", "0767817672", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000F48D3M", "B001LRJH0U", "B000GFRI4K", "B000NIVJFY", "B004SIP6QI", "0792835727", "B000NOIVT0", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00J5G1P2W", "B000059H7K", "6305504024", "B000E6ESU8", "B000EHSVUU", "B007FQXEXW", "B0006HBZXS", "B005FQ2HDC", "0767812182", "6304711905", "B00HOGBXS6", "B003AWRMCE", "B0008ENHUS", "B00116GEJS", "B00000K3D5", "B00005JKN2", "B00AEFYPHA", "B004AOECXI", "B00F3TDA6O", "B004XWGZK0", "B00IJS2OHM", "B000EHSVW8", "B000031EGW", "B0007OY2OO", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B009INAI02", "B002NZK5R8", "B003NF97MQ", "B00096S4DK", "B00083FZFY", "B00JU949TK", "B0018PH3L0", "B0007MAO0C", "B00AEFY4IA", "B00JA3RVG4", "B004SEUJOQ", "B0038EGD3I", "B00KHA99BY", "B00005UQ9T", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B000XR9L50", "B00028G7IO", "B0001Z3I0I", "0767817710", "B000BITVBA", "B000ANVPP6", "B000W1SZBS", "B00005JKTF", "B002O3Z4WK", "B00003CXGV", "6304698747", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00AEFXFW6", "B0000694Y3", "B00AEFYSEA", "B003L20IG0", "B00GMV8JVI", "6305310335", "B0000C2IR4", "B000NQRR34", "B005NGKMOU", "B00A92MD8G", "B00AEBB8W4", "B000059XTH", "B0007TKHGG", "B00007AJE1", "B0045HCJTO", "B000BRP4BM", "B0016OLXN2", "0790736411", "B00IKM5MIA", "B0045HCJ8K", "B00096S49Y", "B000QRI1GW", "B00368PSKK", "B007PXYWNQ", "B000A2UBN4", "B00005LOL0", "B00004WG2F", "B00H9L26AA", "B00AEFXKUI", "B00AEBB9UK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001AZW73M", "B000F8O2QU", "B001NFNFIK", "B00009RDG9"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 141357}, "asin": "B00005JMPT", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K1WVQMH7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Missing (Widescreen Special Edition)"}

{"description": "Even though it's only a single disc, the28 Days LaterDVD includes a lot of very interesting features, including the alternate ending that was shown after the end of the film a couple months into its theatrical run.  It's much bleaker, as director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland say in their optional commentary.  Another alternate ending is almost the same as the theatrical ending but slightly less happy.  Most interesting is the \"radical\" alternate ending that takes an entirely different path midway through the film.  It wasn't filmed, however, so Boyle and Garland narrate the action over storyboards, and it's a surprisingly engrossing 11 minutes.  Boyle and Garland also did a commentary track for the film, and they talk about how they were able to get the shots of deserted London and why they used the ending they did.  There are also six very watchable deleted scenes, and Boyle and Garland's comments range from \"great sequence\" to \"a disgrace.\" Slightly less relevant is a 24-minute documentary that spends its first 10 minutes on the real-life threat of infectious diseases before recapping the film and discussing such elements as the use of digital video and the boot camp the actors had to attend. If you need any further proof that the DVD was a labor of love, even the stills galleries have commentaries.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000TJBN80", "B0002ABURA", "B0006A9FKA", "B002WY65VU", "B00111YM5Q", "B0013D8LAE", "B000IHY9TS", "B000Y7U98C", "B00005JO16", "B0021L8UXA", "B0001611DI", "B0013D8LA4", "B000RJO56O", "B002JT69IW", "B001D2WU9I", "B002VWNIDG", "B0002CHK1S", "B00D7AM6M0", "B003UGLCIA", "B00AEFYYH6", "B001MVYUR0", "B000UAE7O0", "B003EYVXYG", "B000EHRVP6", "B0028DRGDQ", "B0021L8UPS", "B001NPD9LS", "B005LAIIMG", "B000FAOC2W", "B000LP6KNU", "B0006SSOHC", "B000WC3864", "B0013FDM7E", "B00000K3TO", "B000RIWAVW", "B000GCFO0I", "B000O76ZQC", "B004LWZW24", "B000RJO578", "B002VKB0KG", "B006ISJR7U", "B00004TS0G", "B004SIP9MY", "B002VKE1K2", "B00G5GNYY2", "B000N6TX1I", "B0024FADD8", "B005QUQRBU", "B001MYIXAC", "B00D3DJIG8", "B001GUYB08", "B000TGJ80S", "B000V4UFZK", "B004SIP92O", "B00009MGEM", "B0010X73ZG", "B00005K3NR", "B002LMSWN2", "B000063RQQ", "B00000ILDD", "B004BZ5AN2", "0767802519", "B00001QGUM", "B00AJLHUA8", "B002SJIO4A", "B00005JMUA", "B00J5LXT6M", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B000AXWHSA", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00005JLWN", "B004BLJQOK", "B0015ET3YO", "B008220BLG", "B000031WD9", "B000069HZP", "B000EQ5SRK", "B0007Y08QA", "B000PMLJMQ", "B000BUNZY2", "B002ZG98UA", "B000V4UH08", "B001JNNDJM", "B003HKN52U", "B003UAKEBW", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0019X3YX2", "B00CE00ZV8", "B00003CXCF", "B0009WFEDC", "B000FS9FE4", "B00005JNJV", "B00011CZRE", "B002T9H2LA", "B000RW5BZ0", "B00005JMXX", "B000WC389G", "B007STBUHI", "B002ZG983M"], "bought_together": ["B000TJBN80", "B002WY65VU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008SAPC20", "B003J42JLC", "B000Y7U98C", "B0002ABURA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 37382}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.25, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00005JMA8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511KHM89SFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "28 Days Later (Widescreen Special Edition)"}
{"description": "Like any DVD blockbuster from producer Jerry Bruckheimer, the extras are plentiful and often a bit too self-congratulatory (worst offender here is the primary commentary track). The slickly (natch) produced making-of documentary goes through the standard routine; however, the less-flashy \"fly on the wall\" bits--just showing what happens on set without comment--is more fun, offering effortless insight on the filmmaking process. The best treasure is a nifty interactive history on pirates with plenty of background material. You can simply play the filmed segments or take a tour around a ship to discover the material (and a few surprises). There's a lot of archival material on the theme-park ride that inspired the film and several odds and ends including an enjoyable chronicle of the vintage ship's voyage from its home harbor to the movie set. The kids should really dig the DVD-ROM \"Moonlight Becomes Ye,\" in which they can turn their own mug into a ghostly pirate. There's also a bounty of extended and deleted scenes (19 in all) and a very funny blooper reel. With both DTS and Dolby 5.1, sound systems will get a workout with the excellent (and loud) sound design.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000I0RQVI", "B000U7WV1Y", "B005COPWZW", "B004A8ZWUQ", "B00005JN5E", "B0013BM63O", "B006VRRGNK", "B00005JKZV", "B00005JPH2", "B0014Z4OMU", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00003CWT6", "B004DTLK80", "B00005JKZY", "B0000A1RJI", "B004M1A21K", "B004DTLK7G", "B00003CXZ1", "B001HN694K", "B001E75QH0", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00005JKCH", "B0087ZG7HK", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B000E6EK2Y", "B000E8M0VA", "B003UYUQZW", "B00AEFYGBA", "B000W746GK", "B00005JMQW", "B0083SBMBM", "B001DHXT20", "B0002234LS", "B000W7F5SS", "B002PMV9FG", "B0002KVUKM", "B004EPYZUS", "B0053FANRC", "B00BEZTMFY", "6304806434", "B000VR0570", "0783231644", "B001OQCV6A", "B000AYELVA", "B008JFUO72", "B005G4TJUC", "B00004R99S", "B00023B1LC", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00003CXI1", "B001HQZJMU", "B00000IRE6", "B0002ZDVEU", "B008QE9XD2", "B00F84H73Q", "B00E5I2MEK", "B003Y5H5EW", "B007K3JFUQ", "B003QO8TOQ", "B000NQRR1Q", "B000YPUF9W", "B001EZE5BU", "B004A8ZWSS", "B0009MDPYM", "B00LG6YEKE", "B002ZG980U", "B002ZG994U", "B000U1ZV8K", "B001DZ8TRW", "B00005JLR2", "B000VWYJ86", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00000JQB5", "B004XKCZAG", "B000W796OM", "B001GCUO0W", "B00AQSN7HE", "B00000ILDH", "B0053FANT0", "B0000VAFO0", "B0002IQMAM", "B000HRMAPE", "B004LWZW7Y", "B008UZA8FY", "B0001HLVS2", "B00007AJGH", "B00005JNJV", "B003YAR97K", "B00CHVJODE", "B000UR9T8C", "B0049IHX2C", "B000G6BLW4", "B00177YA1K", "0783227345", "B0014Z4ON4", "B001TK80C0", "B002O5M4T4", "B00AEBBA72", "B00005JOC9"], "bought_together": ["B000I0RQVI", "B000U7WV1Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005COPWZW", "B000I0RQVI", "B0071JADFU", "B00005JPFX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6260}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.23, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JM5E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51fX40gGdXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}

{"description": "The supplemental features ofFahrenheit 9/11offer almost an hour and a half of further manna for Michael Moore's supporters and ammunition for his critics, including appearances by two of the most memorable figures in the film, Michigan mother Lila Lipscomb and Marine corporal Abdul Henderson.  \"The Release ofFahrenheit 9/11\" (11 minutes) collects reactions to the film from celebrities, political leaders, and Quentin Tarantino and Tilda Swinton of the 2004 Cannes Film Festival jury (but no film critics).  Lipscomb gives a moving speech at the film's Washington, D.C. premiere (4 minutes), and in an 18-minute sequence, an embedded Swedish journalist recounts his experiences, accompanied by footage of U.S. soldiers raiding an Iraqi home.  This provides the context for the scene in the main film in which a soldier gets his picture taken with a bound and hooded Iraqi, which is chillingly similar to the infamous pictures from Abu Ghraib prison.  The second part of the DVD features consists of seven new or extended scenes (about 50 minutes total), including more footage of Iraq before the invasion; protesters outside Abu Ghraib and former prisoners showing their injuries; more thoughts from Cpl. Abdul Henderson; National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice trying to squirm off the hook in front of the 9/11 Commission; and President Bush going through the motions of a press appearance after he appeared before the same commission.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000UNYJXQ", "B0030Y11XS", "B00008DDVV", "B00009YXAS", "B00008K76O", "B0030Y11O2", "B0002RQ2Q2", "B001G43C1S", "B00008L3TE", "B0041KKYBA", "B00068VAOG", "B000T28C5Y", "B000ICL3KG", "B000BTH4K4", "B002FOQY7M", "B0002OXVBO", "B001NMT8R0", "B001MFNB5I", "B001MVWFAO", "0743272927", "B000FBH3W2", "B0007DBJM8", "B000UYX4N6", "B0027BOL4G", "B000U6YJMO", "B00G0PXU2Y", "B00005JPXA", "B000GYHRHO", "B002EP8TQG", "B000C3L2IO", "B000JVSUSE", "B004EPYZDA", "B0016N52IK", "B001BEK8FQ", "B0041KKYBK", "B00KY6YAO2", "B00F12IRSO", "B00DYC648S", "B001F5274G", "B0001L3LUE", "B000HWXOT0", "B005FITIGO", "B003CJXJ8Q", "B0013D8LHM", "B00DPUB5LK", "044653224X", "B005KBJC0I", "B004FQX59I", "B00KUS5YGC", "B007KAUWO2", "B00GYG8BKK", "B000093NQZ", "B001P9G3HE", "B00483VQTE", "B003Q6D28C", "B001B7CNW4", "B000BBOUHM", "B00744WZ8U", "B00066VTBW", "B001KWB0L0", "B00443YDWK", "B000059TG8", "B000JLTRIQ", "B003JUINFM", "0060392452", "B000I5Y8FU", "B000BITURA", "B003XKNGLY", "B004EPYZDK", "B003M987AG", "B000PY52IG", "B006ML50QK", "B000QGE89W", "B00EK52XQK", "B00DENQEE6", "B000GH3CR0", "B0047UJBP4", "B00005J75F", "0446693790", "B0006N2DSI", "B001AEF6HM", "B00005JLYW", "B001J66JQI", "B000O0YV7O", "B002NPCJRC", "B00AZMFG48", "B0042KZJIC", "B00827OX5Q", "B0002HDXTQ", "B001E5FYS8", "B00AEBB89C", "B003H23KSM", "B000CEXEWA", "0615602223", "B006JN86VW", "B00914YLAG", "B0001IXT36", "B008PUI1GM", "B004SIP7ZS"], "bought_together": ["B000UNYJXQ", "B0030Y11XS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000UNYJXQ", "B0030Y11XS", "B00008DDVV", "B0002OXVBO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 44430}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.0, "brand": "From HIBISCUS EXPRESS, http://www.amazon.com/shops/AXD9LOVGJXES3", "asin": "B00005JNEI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KDRVF1JGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fahrenheit 9/11"}
{"description": "As paranoid cop Del Spooner, Will Smith (Independence Day,Men in Black) displays both his trademark quips and some impressive pectoral muscles inI, Robot. Only Spooner suspects that the robots that provide the near future with menial labor are going to turn on mankind--he's just not sure how. When a leading roboticist dies suspiciously, Spooner pursues a trail that may prove his suspicions. Don't expect much of a connection to Isaac Asimov's classic science fiction stories;I, Robot, the action movie, isn't prepared for any ruminations on the significance of artificial intelligence. This likable, efficient movie won't break any new ground, but it does have an idea or two to accompany its jolts and thrills, which puts it ahead of most recent action flicks.

{"description": "Opposites are forced to attract inAlong Came Polly, a dose of featherweight fluff that could've been better and could've been worse--surely no pairing of Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston can be a complete waste of time, right? Faint praise indeed, but fans of these mainstream funny-folk will enjoy this movie as a lazy-weekend distraction. Ben's a newlywed insurance risk-assessment analyst whose wife (Debra Messing, in a throwaway role) betrays him on their honeymoon. His uptight, play-it-safe lifestyle (which includes acute aversion to germs and irritable bowel syndrome) makes him seemingly incompatible with the spontaneous, free-spirited Polly (Aniston), but writer-director John Hamburg (whose writing credits include the previous Stiller hitsMeet the ParentsandZoolander) is determined to give them at least theappearanceof romantic potential.

{"description": "Without force-feeding its timely message,Good Night, and Good Luckilluminates history to enlighten our present, when the need for a free and independent press is more important than ever. In 90 breathtaking minutes of efficient and intricate storytelling, writer-director George Clooney and cowriter Grant Heslov pay honorable tribute to the journalistic integrity of legendary CBS newscaster Edward R. Murrow,Director George Clooneywho confronted the virulent and overzealous anti-Communist witch-hunting of Wisconsin Sen. Joseph McCarthy in 1953-54, and emerged as a triumphant truth-seeker against the abuses of corporate and governmental power.David Strathairn as Edward R. MurrowAs played by David Strathairn, Murrow is a dogged realist, keenly aware of the smear tactics that will be employed against him; Clooney provides crucial backup as Murrow's \"See It Now\" producer and closest confidante Fred Friendly, forming a fierce but not entirely fearless triumvirate of broadcasting  bravery with CBS chief William Paley (Frank Langella), who anxiously champions Murrow's cause under constant threat of reprisals. While using crisp black-and-white cinematography (by Robert Elswit) to vividly recreate the electrifying atmosphere of the CBS newsroom and the early years of television, Clooney (son of long-time Cincinnati newsman Nick Clooney) proves his directorial skill by juggling big themes and an esteemed ensemble cast, never stooping to simplification of ethically complex material.Good Night, and Good Luckis an instant classic, destined for all the accolades it so richly deserves.--Jeff ShannonLearn More About Edward R.

{"description": "InCry_Wolf, a group of students at a snooty prep school conjure a serial killer when someone takes a hoax a little too seriously. Owen (Julian Morris,Whirlygirl), who's just transferred to Westlake Academy, quickly becomes enamored of Dodger (Lindy Booth,Wrong Turn), a smart and sultry redhead who masterminds a game based on lying and manipulating the other players. After a murder in the nearby woods, Owen escalates the game by concocting a hoax about a serial killer called the Wolf--a hoax that swiftly turns into reality when the not-so-imaginary Wolf sends threatening e-mails to Owen.Cry_Wolfmixes your standard slasher movie with your standard secret-twist movie to no particularly effect. The Wolf--who wears an orange ski-mask and wields a hunting knife--is a generic boogeyman; text messages just aren't scary; and all the characters combined couldn't muster up an engaging personality. This movie was obviously made to fit a market niche, not because a writer or director had any genuine inspiration or had to exorcise a personal fear--but even for a b-movie this is meager stuff.

{"description": "Helen Mirren reigns supreme inThe Queen, a witty and ingenious look at a moment that rocked the house of Windsor:  the week that followed the sudden death of Princess Diana in 1997. Diana's death came at just the same time that Prime Minister Tony Blair (played by the bright Michael Sheen) was settling into his new government--and trying to figure out the delicate relationship between 10 Downing Street and Queen Elizabeth II (Mirren). A large portion of the British population was trying to figure out the Windsors that week, as Elizabeth remained stiff-upper-lip and largely mum about the death of the beloved princess. In Peter Morgan's skillful script, we watch as Blair grows increasingly impatient with the Royals, who are sequestered in their Scottish estate while the public demands some show of grief. Prince Philip (James Cromwell, in good form) clumsily decides to take Diana's sons hunting, while a sympathetically-treated Prince Charles (Alex Jennings) displays some frustration with his mother's eerie calm.None of this conveys how funny the film is, or how deftly it flows from one scene to the next. Director Stephen Frears (Dirty Pretty Things) deserves great credit for that, and for the performances, and for the movie's marvelous sense of well-roundedness; you could see this movie and groan at the cluelessness of the Royals and their outmoded existence, or you might just sympathize with showing reserve in a world that values gross public displays of emotion. But either way, you'll marvel at Mirren, who makes the Queen far more alert and human than one might ever have imagined.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B003UESJH4", "B001C4AFOY", "B004M9QNVK", "B004GXKBDI", "B0059XTUVI", "B000Z8H0IC", "B000ZOXDFA", "B000RF7XYO", "B001L57ZZG", "B001TH92N4", "B000BKDNX0", "B0006Q93H4", "B000EOTELI", "B004XYOQU4", "B009TT0BSE", "B0012QE4Q2", "B001QUF3SW", "B007HW8U2Y", "B000EHQUGC", "B00342ANSA", "B004SIP9U6", "B000V02CNW", "B00005O7N8", "B00GM7STPI", "B003N9ASF2", "B002ZG99EK", "B004SIP71M", "B003Y5H4Y8", "B0001I55M4", "B001AZIRVI", "B00015HXDG", "B000E1NXJ0", "B000RF7XYY", "B00121QGPY", "B009AMANBA", "B000M06KJ8", "B000MEYJHY", "B00005JOFQ", "B007TBJUVI", "B0085A9JXG", "B003AND1SM", "B000NIVJF4", "B0010X73Z6", "B000K7VHQE", "B00005JKNF", "B000MCH5P4", "B001TR4G6W", "B004P7CNZO", "B0050PYNN0", "B000GH3CR0", "B00AEFY8MM", "B0068MNO4S", "B002RSDW80", "B001MVWFAO", "B004ZNFTDQ", "B000255LIY", "B000V6LSOA", "B00ARX2VZW", "B000G6BM0K", "B008220C38"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003UESJH4", "B004M9QNVK", "B001C4AFOY", "B004GXKBDI"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPAM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K34G0GCBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Queen"}

{"description": "This two-disc collector's edition ofPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chestis packed with over five hours of special features that delve into everything from creating the mythology-inspired Davy Jones and Kraken figures, to working and planning without a completed script, the incredible CGI techniques used in the film, the intense sword training sessions and stunt work, and the unpredictability of filming on location in the Caribbean. The audio commentary by writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio is an interesting and insightful look into the finished film, but perhaps even more revealing is the 25-minute \"Charting the Return\" preproduction diary in which everyone from producer Jerry Bruckheimer to associate director Peter Kohn and writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio give a sense of the enormity of the project of concurrently writing and filming two sequels toPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. The overwhelming logistics of planning and casting without a finished script, scouting and preparing remote locations, constructing a new Black Pearl, and functional props like the rolling water wheel, and cutting costs to stay within budget are nothing less than mind-boggling. In the hourlong \"According to Plan\" feature, director Gore Verbinski, producer Jerry Bruckheimer, and a host of others detail the enormity of the project, focusing on the stamina involved in a 200-day shooting schedule and the need for adaptability and flexibility in dealing with everything from behind schedule excavations to the logistics of shooting on moving water and even the natural fury of a full-blown hurricane.  Shorter featurettes \"Meet Davy Jones: Anatomy of a Legend\" and \"Creating the Kraken\" focus on the mythological creatures in the film and the awesome visual effects and advances in CGI technology that made them possible.  \"Mastering the Blade\" follows Orlando Bloom (Will Turner), Keira Knightley (Elizabeth Swann), and Jack Davenport (Norrington) through some intense sword-fighting training sessions and \"Fly on the Set: The Bone Cage\" offers a frightening look at what it was like to shoot the bone cage scene of the movie.  Other bonus features include bloopers, an interactive tour of Johnny Depp's special makeup effects and wardrobe details, a look at how the 1967 Disney Land Pirates of the Caribbean ride was recently \"re-imagineered\" to incorporate some of the characters and elements from the new movies, producer Jerry Bruckheimer's photo diary, and a glimpse of the glitzy June 24, 2006 red carpet premiere on Disney Land's main street.--Tami Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JM5E", "B005COPWZW", "B004A8ZWUQ", "B0013BM63O", "B00005JN5E", "B004M1A21K", "B004DTLK80", "B000VR0570", "B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY", "B00005JKCH", "B001HN694K", "B00005JPH2", "B00AEFYGBA", "B00BEZTMFY", "B001HQZJMU", "B00E5I2M6I", "B006VRRGNK", "B001BEK8HO", "B000E8M0VA", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B001E75QH0", "B008QE9XD2", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00LG6YEKE", "B00AEBBA72", "B007K3JFUQ", "B000HRMAPE", "B0090SI56Y", "B000E6EK2Y", "B0053FANRC", "B00005JMQW", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B00177YA1K", "B001TK80C0", "B000UR9T8C", "B00003CXI1", "B004EPYZUS", "B00003CXTA", "B001OQCV6A", "B0014Z4ON4", "B005G4TJUC", "B000F7CECK", "B00HFFE8HE", "B001GCUO1Q", "B0087ZG7J8", "B003YAR97K", "B008JFUNTG", "B001GCUO0W", "B000NIBURQ", "B0053FANPY", "B00023B1LC", "B003QO8TOQ", "B002VPE1BQ", "B00F84H73Q", "B003Y5H54W", "B00003CWT6", "B00007AJGH", "B00E5I2M9K", "B000W7F5SS", "B0049IHX2C", "B00000IRE6", "B001F7MSFM", "B000AYELVA", "B002ZG9904", "B000VWYJ86", "B00CFA222M", "B003UYUQZW", "B008UZ949K", "B0002KVUKM", "B000209KMW", "B000UVKGPI", "B0087ZG7HK", "B0000WN140", "B001EZE5BU", "B002PMV9FG", "B000HT386M", "B000NQRR1Q", "B00003CXZ1", "630529142X", "B0002ZDVEU", "B004A8ZWSS", "B00005JM5B", "B000BTITKS", "B00E5I2MEK", "B002HWRYJE", "B001GZ6QC4", "B000W796OM", "B00AQSN7HE", "B0046BI81W", "B001VLBDD0", "B0060FXDCG", "B0084IG8TM", "B005OCFGTO", "B000OLGCIE", "B008JFUS0U", "B00007AJG4", "B009JBWOU0", "B001B3LIOC"], "bought_together": ["B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JM5E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005COPWZW", "B00005JM5E", "B0071JADFU", "B00005JPFX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 72898}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 16.95, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JP0F", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GQE7TQ72L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "Leonardo DiCaprio puts a handsome face on an ugly industry: In parts of Africa, diamond mining fuels civil warfare, killing thousands of innocents and drafting preteen children as vicious soldiers. DiCaprio (The Departed) plays Danny Archer, a white African soldier-turned-diamond-smuggler who gets wind of a large raw jewel found by Solomon Vandy, a native fisherman (Djimon Hounsou,In America) recently escaped from enslavement by a brutal rebel leader. Archer offers a deal: He'll help Vandy find his war-scattered family if Vandy will share the diamond with him. Drawn into this web of exploitation is journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly,Little Children), who agrees to help if Archer will tell her the details of how conflict diamonds make their way into the hands of the corporations who sell them to the Western world. DiCaprio is compelling because he never flinches from Archer's utter ruthlessness; Archer ends up doing the morally justifiable thing, but only because his desperate greed has led him to it. Hounsou and Connelly, though saddled with all the moral and political speeches, rise above the cant and keep the movie's treacherously formulaic plot rooted in human characters. But in the end, the story won't stick with you as much as the dead stillness in the child soldiers' eyes; the horror of African civil strife refuses to be contained byBlood Diamond's uplifting message--and the movie is all the more potent as a result.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001N44BVQ", "B000M341QE", "B00005JLSB", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00080ZG10", "B004SIP7TE", "B006OFN0SE", "B002ZG980U", "B000NIVJF4", "B0007R4T3U", "B0016Q2D66", "B00049QQHI", "B001EZE5DI", "B00003CWM3", "B00008DP4C", "6305268827", "B000BYA5G4", "B00AEBB9F0", "B000Y7WGOW", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000065U1N", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000095WW8", "B000U7169M", "B00DHHWXYY", "B000GFLKF8", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002O3Z510", "B002VWNIEA", "B002ZG99N6", "B0007DFJ0G", "B005LAIIJY", "0792839137", "B000KP62SE", "B000P0J0EW", "B000P0J09M", "B007SPPANM", "B00004XPPG", "B000C20VPA", "B00011CZRE", "B002QEHPQU", "B00005JN2Z", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00003CXWV", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00001ZWUS", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00005JN0W", "B002T9H2LA", "B000MTEFXC", "B003L20IG0", "B00AEBB86A", "B00005JKBC", "B0013XZ2QK", "B0000ACOXL", "B005LAIGRS", "B002AT8K9W", "B0007KIFGE", "B00AZNEW5G", "B003ASLJO0", "B000T28PII", "B002DU39GW", "B002ZG97RE", "B000LC55F2", "B00003CXTG", "B00AEBBA36", "B00B0U2SFE", "B003ASLJQI", "B002CPMB9O", "B00BB67UNW", "B000MXPE7O", "0783231202", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00AEFXVCU", "B00AEFXRRO", "B000A3XY5A", "B002JCSWV6", "B00005JNQA", "B004EPYZP8", "B0050MB4OO", "B000P0J0AG", "B000C65Z1G", "B00275EGWY", "B00005B6JZ", "B0006GANPA", "B00AEBB9NM", "B002XMGGK6", "B000C20VRS", "B0007P0XBO", "B003UESJME", "B000QXDED6", "B00AHTYI5M", "B001P9KR8U", "B004A8ZX28", "B008JFUNKU", "B003ASLJQS", "B002VWNICC", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00005BCKF", "B000NOIX48"], "bought_together": ["B000M341QE", "B002ZG980U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBB8NI", "B00H9KKGTO", "B008MILL8W", "B000BYA5G4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 106777}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.96, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JPGO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61MN8-6skUL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blood Diamond (Two-Disc Special Edition)"}
{"description": "The fact-based mystery ofHollywoodlandtakes place in 1959, when the death ofAdventures of SupermanTV star George Reeves cast a pall over the waning days of golden-age Hollywood. As written by Paul Bernbaum, this intriguing whodunit effectively evokes the tainted atmosphere that surrounded Reeves' death (officially ruled a suicide but never conclusively solved), and speculates on circumstances to suggest that Reeves may have been murdered. In combining the melancholy course of Reeves' career with the investigation of a down-and-out private detective into the possible causes of Reeves' death, the film evolves into an engrossing study of parallels between lives on either side of the Hollywood dream. Building upon a distinguished career in TV including episodes of HBO'sThe Sopranos,RomeandSix Feet Under, director Allen Coulter finds a satisfying balance between the tragic overtones of the Reeves case and the time-honored elements of the gumshoe genre, with Adrien Brody doing fine work as private eye Louis Simo, a fictional composite character who is our conduit to the desperate yearnings of Reeves' final months.In a critically acclaimed performance, Ben Affleck plays Reeves in moody flashbacks, caught betweenSupermanstardom and financial dependence on his lover Toni Mannix (Diane Lane), the somewhat predatory wife of Hollywood \"fixer\" and MGM honcho Eddie Mannix (Bob Hoskins), whose mob connections suggest foul play as Simo's investigation progresses. Reeves' subsequent lover (played by Robin Tunney) may also be culpable, and as Simo's own personal life unravels, his empathy for Reeves takes on added significance. In presenting its mystery as a set of plausible scenarios,Hollywoodlandholds interest as a mystery that's refreshingly compassionate toward the fate of its characters. Warts and all, they're likable dreamers in a town where dreams don't always come true.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000K2UVZM", "B002VWNICC", "B003P3PQL2", "B000A5046K", "B000BT96FA", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B000HWZ4E8", "B000IU37SO", "B00005JL5F", "B00015HWX2", "B0009G3B0G", "B00AEBB89W", "B000087F7Q", "B000QGEB1M", "B000LC3IDS", "B00003CWSR", "B003UESJEW", "B000EQHXNW", "B004SEUIZG", "0783235380", "B0001WTVIE", "B001NFNFNU", "1618933949", "B0002V7O5Q", "B000AM6P2U", "B000I8OM94", "B00J2PQYYK", "B00ICWO1LC", "B00006RCNY", "B00000K31T", "B0016Q2D66", "B00002RAO2", "B003UESJCY", "B000092T3P", "B000OYAT3U", "6305428522", "B003VEL9EI", "B00HZVX14O", "B004SIP7VM", "0790732149", "B001U0HB5Q", "B004XVMCH6", "B000HT3PBU", "B00AEFXRWO", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00006RCNV", "B004XVMCKS", "B0000959N0", "B00I116MVQ", "B000Q8QH0I", "B00AEFYC96", "B00ARA4SLU", "B00HGBAG5K", "B00006CXGZ", "B004LYWPZE", "B004ALIG1U", "B0016MOWOQ", "B000IJ79XE", "B00DC5JVE6", "B000M341SC", "B00029LO5E", "B00CHMBQRA", "B000F7CMRM", "B000FO0AHY", "B00E18QKJ2", "B0045O2PHS", "B004SIP7PS", "B0001NBNDY", "B00J5LXT44", "B003VE9WU6", "B000C65Z1G", "B00AEFYIDG", "B00005JMON", "B00005JL8F", "B00009MEKN", "B00HT2RTU6", "B000EHSVSC", "B0006IIKQW", "B00AEFXBPM", "B00HOGBXTU", "B003LR5BD0", "B0018O4YT0", "B0000694ZI", "B00005NKSK", "B002J1RZHE", "B000286RNE", "B0030BOCMS", "B00H91LVOM", "B000YV1Q2G", "B002DU39GW", "B003UESJEM", "B00F6SHG5S", "B000MXPE7O", "B001N44BVQ", "B0089XJXRQ", "B003EYVXSW", "B001DJ7PR8", "B0000C2IVA", "B000U1ZV76", "B0002O7XUO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000K2UVZM", "0596101996", "B002VWNICC", "0596805527"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 921340}, "asin": "B00005JP90", "imUrl": "http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-site/icons/no-img-sm._CB192198896_.gif", "title": "Hollywoodland"}
{"description": "Here's hoping James Mangold's big, raucous, and ultrabloody remake of3:10 to Yumaleads some moviegoers to check outDelmer Daves's beautifully lean, half-century-old original. That classic Western spun a tale of captured outlaw Ben Wade (Glenn Ford)--deadly but disarmingly affable--and the small-time rancher and family man, Dan Evans (Van Heflin), desperate enough to accept the job of helping escort the badman to Yuma prison. Wade, knowing that his gang will be along at any moment to spring him, works at persuading the ultimately lone deputy to accept a bribe, turn his back on \"duty,\" and go home safe and rich to his family. That the outlaw has come to admire his captor intriguingly complicates the suspense.All of the above applies in the new3:10, but it takes a lot more huffing and puffing to get Wade (Russell Crowe this time) and Evans (Christian Bale) into position for the showdown. Mostly, more is less. To Mangold's credit, his movie doesn't traffic in facile irony or postmodern detachment; it aims to be a straight-up Western and deliver the excitement and charisma the genre's fans are starved for. But recognizing that contemporary viewers might be out of touch with the bedrock simplicity and strength of the genre--not to mention its code of honor--Mangold has supplied both Evans and Wade with a plethora of backstory and \"motivations.\" At the overblown action climax, the crossfire of personal agendas is almost as frenetic as the copious gunplay. (By that point the movie has killed more people than the Lincoln County War.)Best thing about the remake is Russell Crowe's Ben Wade, a Scripture-quoting career villain with an artist's eye and a curiously principled sense of whom and when to murder. As his second-in-command, Ben Foster fairly pirouettes at every opportunity to commit mayhem, and Peter Fonda contributes a fierce portrait of an old Wade adversary turned bounty hunter for the Pinkerton detective agency.--Richard T.

{"description": "Son of FrankensteinBasil Rathbone comes to Transylvania to inherit his father's estate in this second sequel toFrankenstein. The townspeople are suspicious, but young Frankenstein has no interest in reviving his father's work--until he discovers the monster hidden away in the castle, inert but very much intact and watched over by Ygor (Bela Lugosi), a sinister, snaggletoothed peasant with a broken neck. Convinced to revive the creature and vindicate his father's name, Frankenstein toils away in the lab not realizing that Ygor plans to use the monster to revenge himself on the jury that sentenced him to hang. Boris Karloff makes his final appearance as the Monster, now little more than a mute, lumbering robot under the hypnotic control of Ygor. Rathbone is a dignified, suave scientist and a marvelous match to Lugosi's mad Ygor, a richly malevolent performance that dominates the film. Lionel Atwill makes a marvelous addition to the Frankenstein gallery as the wooden-armed constable, a legacy of the monster's rampage 25 years before. (Mel Brooks's loving lampoonYoung Frankenstein, a veritable remake of this film, features the constable and his lumber limb in a major role.) Universal abandoned horror films in 1936, but the success of this sequel single-handedly revived the genre. Though lacking the gothic splendor and macabre humor of James Whale's originals, Rowland V. Lee's handsome production remains an intelligent, well-made classic of the genre and Universal's last great horror film. Lugosi returns as Ygor inThe Ghost of Frankenstein.The Ghost of FrankensteinThe monster lives! Again! Picking up whereSon of Frankensteinleft off, Bela Lugosi's gnarled Ygor survives yet another rampage by angry, torch-carrying villagers and frees the monster (The Wolf Manhimself, Lon Chaney Jr., taking over from Boris Karloff) from his sulfur grave. The latest cinematic Frankenstein scion, brain surgeon Ludwig (Cedric Hardwicke), wants to dissect the creature, but the ghost of his father convinces him to save it by giving it a new, \"good\" brain. Ygor has his own devious plan and enlists Ludwig's shady assistant (Lionel Atwill) in a brain-switching scheme.Ably directed by the pedestrian Erle C. Kenton,The Ghost of Frankensteingives up the gothic mood and moral quandaries of the original films for the busy, action-packed plots that defined Universal horror films of the 1940s. The human characters are all rather dull (except for Lugosi's animated, eye-rolling performance), and Chaney has none of Karloff's pathos or subtlety under the make-up, but the film opens with a spectacular bang as the villagers dynamite the castle, and skips from one inspired scene to another. The monster rejuvenates himself during an electrical storm with a jolt of lightning, mutely undergoes a courtroom cross-examination (by a ridiculously intent Ralph Bellamy), and finally goes on a blind rampage in the fiery climax. Frankenstein's monster returns (this time with Lugosi as the creature) inFrankenstein Meets the Wolf Man.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005LC4K", "B00005LC4J", "B00005LC4N", "B00005LC4M", "078323502X", "B00005LC4O", "B006TTC5J0", "B00000JMOF", "B0000694WM", "B00001TZ6Q", "B00000JQB7", "B00000F62P", "0783233582", "B00005NSXY", "B003M8NGG2", "B000035Z3K", "B0016586Q8", "B000WNHTCC", "B0009X770E", "0783240961", "B0001CNRLG", "B000FWHW8Q", "B000U1ZV7G", "B0007R4T26", "B00B94VJYW", "B00000ILEU", "B000FWHW90", "B001B9ZVVC", "B005D0RDKM", "0783240953", "B000EHQTZO", "B0009X770O", "B002945DUW", "B000FVQLKW", "B00005KHJP", "B000063UR0", "B00D9EJFZA", "B0000694WH", "B000A0GOEQ", "B00LC4PFOY", "B00005R1O7", "B00009NHC0", "B000A0GOFA", "B000UAFDR0", "B008FL8OTK", "B00D9EJFV4", "B0013XZ6SY", "B0002NRRQU", "B000EHSVJG", "B000A1INIA", "B005AMJ3B0", "B000062XEY", "B000UDGOBG", "B0001HAGTM", "B00009NHBC", "B000FOPPEC", "B0000AUHOK", "B005FQ2H0A", "B000GRUQJW", "B00HFWETZ8", "B0034PWPHY", "B00000K3U3", "B00009PY4D", "B00KTFJ50M", "B007Y1NNAW", "B00006G8K0", "B000VX9WB4", "B00AEBB8VK", "B005ETANC2", "B00DOZNGC2", "B00LC4PBTS", "B00HRUQ8X4", "B0001CNRNE", "B009KG7F30", "B00006G8JZ", "B0000AUHOO", "B00K1L4NBU", "B000095J42", "B000068TPF", "B00KTZALDC", "B000AQKU72", "B00009PY38", "B009AGEY98", "B0001CNRLQ", "B0007R4SZY", "B002TSAAS8", "B002DY9KQG", "B000RXVNDI", "B000QGEB1W", "B0002NRRRY", "B0016LFUVQ", "B00HRUQ7WG", "B0087ZG7RK", "B00DNUSFUG", "B0045HCJS0", "B002VEWMGS", "B005ETAN7C", "B00IE41A9O", "B000A0GOFK", "6305944288"], "bought_together": ["B00005LC4K", "B006TTC5J0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B006TTC5J0", "B00005LC4K", "B00005LC4N", "0783233582"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 19304}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.2, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

{"description": "Revered as the author of the Declaration of Independence, the most sacred document in American history, yet condemned as a lifelong owner of slaves, Thomas Jefferson remains the enigma that is America. Part One: A young Thomas Jefferson from the Virginia wilderness is transformed by the fire of the Enlightenment into his country's most articulate voice for human liberty. Torn between serene family life at Monticello and his passion for politics, Jefferson suffers heartrending personal loss, even as he gives voice to a new era of democratic government. He then journeys to Paris as U.S. Minister to France for George Washington and supports the rising French Revolution. Part Two: Returning from France, Jefferson strives to preserve the new, fragile American government and helps create the first political party through his bitter struggles with the Federalists.

{"description": "Fans of Freddie Prinze Jr. will no doubt enjoySummer Catch, which features Freddie running through sprinklers on a baseball diamond wearing nothing but an orange thong. Freddie plays Ryan, an aspiring pitcher at baseball camp. Ryan grew up in the New England town that hosts the camp, mowing lawns with his landscaping father, so he's torn between his local friends and his new baseball buddies. Meanwhile, he's being pursued by a rich and beautiful local girl with the odd name of Tenley (Jessica Biel), whose father doesn't approve of her cavorting with the lawn boy. Ryan's an incredibly talented pitcher--everyone agrees, especially his bartending brother who also wanted to play ball but lacked the gift--but he's haunted by fear of failure and the recent loss of his mother.

{"description": "Third time is not quite the charm for Eddie Murphy's Axel Foley when he heads for L.A. once again to avenge a friend's murder. This time he's off to the Disneyesque WonderWorld, apparently the most hazardous theme park in America despite an army of shady security agents. John Landis directed Murphy in his first film hit,Trading Places, and would seem a good match for this mix of action and comedy, but his sense of fun only emerges in a few scenes (chubby mechanics do a gymnastic Blues Brothers number to a Diana Ross tune) and his action direction is sloppy and shockingly violent. It seems wrong for the comic tone, and Murphy should have his foul mouth washed out with soap. On the plus side, Bronson Pinchot returns as Serge and all but upstages Murphy in two brief but hilarious scenes.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005U5A8", "B00005JKCB", "B00000I1JZ", "B000MGBSE4", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00AEFXBG6", "B00AEBB99Q", "B00BTYRB2G", "6304806450", "B004QXJZYO", "B000U1ZV8K", "B00005N5SA", "0790738953", "B000O78KW4", "B00004STUL", "B00005N5SB", "6305428441", "B00AEFY6TW", "B001TK80C0", "B00AEBB9AA", "B000FO0A9W", "B000069I1H", "B009WGYXIS", "B000CEV3M8", "B0006J28MI", "B00003CY5Y", "B001VLBDD0", "B00006FDBT", "B0001VTPW2", "B00029NMRM", "0790732149", "B0001VTPWC", "0790731924", "0790742012", "B000WGYMTC", "0767803434", "1558908404", "B000O77SRM", "0783227396", "B00005JL72", "B00005IBN0", "B0000639EX", "0783222149", "6305213283", "6305213305", "B001FB55HQ", "B004WJT5E2", "B00005QT9P", "B000FO0AA6", "B000YGDNPO", "B000065V3E", "B001AV3BYK", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000FI8MPW", "B001B3LIOC", "6304712987", "B002AS466O", "B000063UR3", "B002GHHHL0", "B000055Y0Y", "B0009X760U", "B000BBOUW2", "B00008977B", "B00005N5S5", "0783225539", "0780624890", "1558908846", "B0045HCIYA", "B004SIP9P6", "B00005JNTI", "B008G4T7W4", "B001NPD9LS", "B00004Z4WR", "B00AEFYDM2", "B004XQO8JG", "B00003GPFT", "B00AEFXPYY", "6304806434", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B002GHHHME", "B00AEFXPG2", "0790736411", "B00006HAWN", "B0006D3HGA", "B000VNMMR0", "B00008G8M4", "B005GT3X68", "B002O3Z50G", "B00000IQW2", "B0045HCJFS", "B00026ZG10", "B003AWRMCE", "B00008WFU4", "B00HW3L9MG", "0790732238", "B000WTVZGC", "B00BTYSIWI", "B00008DDXA", "B002ZG98LO", "B0000696HX"], "bought_together": ["B00005U5A8", "B00005JKCB"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JKCB", "B00005U5A8", "B000MGBLSC", "B00AEBB99Q"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 79172}, "asin": "B00005U5A9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ARS42GDAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Beverly Hills Cop III"}

Rick (Jason London fromDazed and Confused), who hopes to run Bull Mountain, can't forget about Anna, the French girl he romanced while vacationing in Mexico. When a ruthless developer (Lee Majors, star ofThe Six Million Dollar Man) wants to turn the rough-and-tumble site into a sleek, tourist-friendly resort named Snownook, Rick discovers that Anna is the developer's daughter. Will he be seduced to the dark side by love and ambition? Alongside scenes \"borrowed\" fromCasablanca, there's an abundance of high jinks with Rick's slacker snow buddies, cute girls (includingPlaymate of the YearVictoria Silvstedt), and some pretty amazing snowboarding sequences. Dumb but good-natured fun, and Majors clearly enjoys himself as the bad guy.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EMGJAO", "B000JJ4DNW", "B0000WN1PO", "0783230338", "B0002V7TMY", "B0062MDNEK", "B00363WGBO", "B00AEFZ7F4", "B002ZG97XI", "B000IZJZIU", "B00AEFYSL8", "B00AEFXVW0", "B00005JKMN", "B00005KA6V", "B000CPH9PM", "B00009OWJU", "B0023TCWE8", "B00AEFYS2M", "0790751445", "B000M9CB4W", "B00008L3W3", "B001OD4S50", "B000PMGS6S", "6305433925", "B00AEFY854", "B00AEFYZCU", "B00AEFZ3XU", "B00BLN4V0A", "B000LC3ICE", "B00005JMX6", "B00005V9HR", "B000089778", "B00260HH1W", "B00860YIJU", "B000069CF0", "B00008L3T3", "B00003CWUX", "B00AEBB9UU", "B000BKJ758", "B000RGX0DQ", "B0051MKNRC", "B000063RQO", "B00029RTAI", "B004I9SJH0", "B00AEBB8GA", "B0016MJ6GA", "B000VXWX7E", "B008R65XTC", "B00003GPFT", "6305428387", "6305428549", "B0026BXHQ0", "B0012IWNZY", "B00441GYVA", "B001J9KJ4I", "B000031EFY", "6305161860", "B0010VDYLK", "B007P9HW3M", "B000BO0LOU", "6305428492", "B00E1HIXFW", "B002M36R1Y", "B00AEFYPXY", "B00006AUHQ", "B004ZJZQ6U", "B001G5T6GW", "0783229526", "B003SLEDG0", "B00003CXPS", "B000065K5H", "B00000F0AD", "B00193F30E", "1573625574", "B000FBNG1O", "B001FU793A", "B000Y7U94G", "B0054WPWNY", "B000I0RNVQ", "B004GTVU6O", "B000J4P9P8", "B00AEFY7YQ", "B00006HAYO", "B00AEFXESQ", "B002NZK5Q4", "B00389JERU", "B000A7DVR2", "B008R65XUQ", "B00005RIKM", "B001NPD9PY", "B004FOPFGG", "B0001WTVHA", "B00AEFXJS6", "B004SIP8ES", "B00FOHHMWI", "B0068FZ0O2", "B002O3Z4XY", "B0071HPOJW", "079284646X", "B00005U8QN"], "bought_together": ["B000EMGJAO", "B000JJ4DNW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002ZG97XI", "B000EMGJAO", "B000JJ4DNW", "B00363WGBO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 111542}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 40.0, "brand": "", "asin": "B0000633TZ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514KDFZMXWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Out Cold"}

{"description": "From the director of Arlington Road comes a spine-tingling, super-natural thriller based on actual events that will rattle your nerves and shake your beliefs. Distraught by the sudden, tragic death of his wife (Debra Messing), John Klein (Richard Gere), a journalist for The Washington Post, finds himself mysteriously drawn to a small West Virginia town when his car inexplicably strands him. Rescued by the sympathetic but skeptical local police sergeant (Laura Linney), he soon learns that many of the town's residents have been beset by bizarre events, including sightings of an eerie \"moth-like\" entity, similar to the one seen by his late wife. Investigating further and having his own terrifying encounters with the creature, he becomes obsessed with the idea that this supernatural being canpredict impending calamities and is trying to warn the town of one. Is this a psychic delusion brought on by his grief or can he convince the police sergeant that there's a tragedy that must be averted", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKZH", "B004BVS2C2", "0765334984", "B00AEBBA2W", "B003102JDC", "B00005JNNT", "B005FUTBSC", "B0002DB54A", "0765341972", "B004SIP92O", "B00ECW9UJY", "B00005JNY3", "B00AEFYC96", "B00L9K2EGS", "B00LBFFR2Y", "B00AEFYYH6", "B0013D8LCC", "6305310335", "B00005JL3T", "0966724674", "6305308837", "B00K2CHW48", "B003DQIPVO", "079074208X", "B000YNFXZA", "B009NZXH5S", "B0001Z52RU", "B00004BZIY", "B00006RCNY", "B00LG6XHDY", "B004B3PBFQ", "B000WMFZN8", "B0006IIKQW", "B0058ZPNUE", "B000TJ6PBK", "B00K2CHWYI", "B000068IEX", "1938398033", "0783240295", "0783116926", "B00BEIYMAG", "B000056T5E", "B00005RHGK", "B00064LJVE", "B005NKIPUY", "B0006HBZXS", "B00K2CHVSK", "B00008EY9G", "B001BRZ5J2", "B00006AUJR", "B000LP6KNU", "B002VWNICC", "6305213305", "6304883773", "B00AEFXW8I", "B0006SGYL0", "B004SIP6WW", "B000V4UFZK", "B000BTJDGC", "B003LR5BD0", "B00151QYOO", "B002AT8KAG", "B0007NFLO0", "0792835727", "B002GHHHN8", "0767817737", "0800177789", "B002O5M4T4", "B00BTYIHS8", "B0045HCJRQ", "B00000JGHL", "B00DZP1C2W", "B00015YVDG", "0792844807", "B00005O5AX", "6305657947", "630542845X", "B002LMSWN2", "B00005UWLB", "B00003L9CQ", "193839819X", "B004LWZW24", "6305718954", "B00BNAE14W", "B00B96TGQS", "0783226888", "B00008L3S6", "6304765258", "B00AEFY4IA", "B003UGLCIA", "B009XTF8KQ", "B004RA7Y9E", "B00AJLHUA8", "B001KMB6X2", "B000KWZ7JC", "B00111YM5Q", "B0050QNO7K", "B000U7169M", "B00AEFYXJ0"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKZH", "B00AEBBA2W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JKZH", "0765341972", "0765334984", "B004SIP92O"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 21120}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.0, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0000648X0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41l8S4jyEIL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Mothman Prophecies"}

{"description": "From the studio that brought you REMEMBER THE TITANS comes an inspirational film based on a true story. Jim Morris (Dennis Quaid), father, teacher, and high school coach, thought his dream was over. He'd had his shot playing baseball, blew out his shoulder, and retired without ever making it to the big leagues. Then, in 1999, Coach Morris made a fateful bet with his perpetually losing team. If they won the district championship, Morris -- who threw a 98 mph fastball -- would try out for the majors. The team went from worst to first, and Jim, living up to his end of the bargain, threw caution to the wind and was on the road to becoming the oldest rookie in the major leagues.

Poirot's own health is soon the last thing on his mind as he becomes convinced that murder is afoot. Lucky for us, he's right. A glamorous actress, a brooding priest, and an assortment of helpful busybodies mix in one of Christie's most famous plots. As is usual in the A&E;Poirotseries, loving attention to period detail, a careful respect for the original novel, and a gentle wink at the quaintness of it all are apparent. Suchet is, as always, a masterful Poirot, full of infuriating quirks and playful genius, and Fraser handles the difficult job of playing the bland-but-not-too-bland Hastings with aplomb. Special DVD features include an index of all the Hercule Poirot stories, as well as biographies of Agatha Christie and David Suchet.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005KH4B", "B001KZOVJK", "0767028627", "B000CRR3EC", "B005X5XINI", "B0002TVWZ6", "B0028AENVC", "B000HHE8F4", "B001KP2J3U", "B004WMOSNM", "B007ISJS0U", "1569383618", "B00GWXI16O", "B006JY3O2M", "B001V7YZAM", "B0006212JK", "B005X5XI4C", "B00GWXI0S8", "B00AEFYO5I", "B00GWXI2RM", "B00D7AM2V0", "B00005QBZL", "B00JJRLFTU", "B0083HXKM2", "B000068UE9", "B00C888LOO", "B006Z4LP9K", "B00005RDRO", "B00DW5IKWK", "B001KP2J3K", "B00005RIX1", "B00GHH9I62", "B00005MM5G", "B001KP2J44", "B00EF0NYVI", "B00A0HT99G", "B00005MM5H", "B00008G8C1", "B000GB5M1U", "B004HJ0ZLE", "B00GAXASKS", "B009DS3VQA", "B00C12ZISE", "B003L80FLC", "B00GWXI1F0", "B0028LOT7O", "B00DW5IL7O", "B000AAAGJK", "B008N8A3DA", "B000GB5M1A", "B009DS6YGO", "B001V7YZAC", "B001V7YZA2", "B000MGTQ7K", "B00A27O5AW", "B0087ZG7OI", "B000068QJU", "B009DS5OEM", "B00DZP1C9K", "B000RPCJB6", "B00005RIWY", "B00005JKNF", "B00008J2PG", "B009D4RW96", "B003N2SUKY", "B000056C0O", "B0000549B0", "1569383626", "B000A1IJS4", "B002OSS8TG", "B001A640YU", "B000069HRS", "B000TVS5XY", "B00007AJDT"], "bought_together": ["B00005KH4B"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001KZOVJK", "B000068QOE", "B00005KH4B", "B001KP2J3U"]}, "price": 15.68, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 71673}, "asin": "B000068QOB", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BJF6EJ4tL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Poirot - Evil Under the Sun"}

{"description": "The DVD set of theBack to the Futuretrilogy is as classy and  professional as the series. Both new and original materials are included in the  plethora of extras, starting with two sets of making-of documentaries. Each disc  has material on that particular film, and some features look at the trilogy as a  whole. Producer-writer Bob Gale is the star of the extra features, candidly  presenting the original ideas and many deleted scenes (a few with doses of crude  humor). Much of the inside stuff is repeated in the various pieces, but that's  to be expected with such exhaustive materials. Michael J. Fox chimes in with a  video commentary presented in a picture-in-picture format (which would have  worked better as a straight interview) and the producers tackle the main  commentary track, but the highlight audio commentary is a free-flowing Q&A; with  Gale and director Robert Zemeckis in front of a USC film-school audience. Long  or short, the materials are uniformly enjoyable and deft, including segments on  advertising, special effects tests, on-screen anecdotes, outtakes, production  designs, and more.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001E75QH0", "B0009RCPY8", "B0057RCFQS", "B000P0J09W", "B001CCSI2W", "B00003CXC5", "B0087F7VSY", "B00003CXC3", "B001AGXEAG", "B00DQC2FPM", "B000FO0AA6", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B000065V42", "B006VRRGNK", "B000E33W26", "B000FO0A9W", "B00008G8LM", "B00IZZDWKM", "B001AEF6C2", "B00003CXCT", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B0006OBPTA", "B00007AJGH", "6305428050", "B0001I562I", "B008X905AK", "B000FS9UKI", "B0008JIJ2E", "B000YGDNPO", "0800141601", "B00AEFY0F2", "0792844890", "B00003CX5P", "B00HFFE8HE", "B0084IHVUC", "B0002WZTOI", "B00ALTQRRK", "0783225547", "B000MGBLTQ", "B0087ZG7HK", "B001DJLD2G", "B001QB9H10", "B0015NORDW", "B000P0J06U", "B009JBWOU0", "B00028HBES", "B000OVLBF8", "B002I9Z8I0", "B003UESJF6", "B00AEFXDO6", "0783231644", "B0000VCZKM", "B0000VCZK2", "B0014Z4OMU", "B00005T7HZ", "B000274T94", "B00006HBUJ", "B0060FXDCG", "B00005JNTU", "B00005JLXH", "B008H6GHEM", "B000QQLVPQ", "B006U1JD5G", "B0001Z3TXE", "B000ASATYY", "B000JYW5BE", "B00000JPH6", "B00005TN8K", "B00005PJ6N", "B000Y11B7Q", "B00008G8M5", "B007SPPANM", "B0012RWQJ8", "B0019HQICW", "B000BPL2GK", "B00005JPD0", "B00AGKHBQK", "B00006ZXSL", "0800177991", "B0067EKYAY"], "bought_together": ["B001E75QH0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001LXIDVI", "B008JFUPFI", "B009JBWOU0", "B0057RCFQS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 65851}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 34.5, "brand": "MCA", "asin": "B00006AL1D", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CRSVV0WEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)"}

{"description": "Fernanda (Ingrid de Souza) is a transgendered youth who was born and raised in a small town in Brazil; though born a male, Fernanda chooses to live life as a woman, and has pulled up stakes to move to Italy and obtain sexual reassignment surgery. Fernanda discovers that Milan is one of the world's centers for transvestite prostitutes, and despite the religious scruples she was born with, Fernanda is soon nudged into a career as a sex worker. Fernanda is befriended by Charlo (Biba Lerhue), an old friend from Brazil who is now hooked on drugs and sells her body to support her habit. Charlo introduces Fernanda to Karin (Lulu Pecorari), a transvestite madame who, sensing Fernanda is an innocent at heart, treats her with care and introduces her to some of her better clients. One night, Fernanda is hired by Gianni (Cesare Bocci), who doesn't realize at first that Fernanda is biologically male; while Gianni is upset at first, he also finds himself attracted to Fernanda, and in time begins to pursue a romantic relationship with her when she's not working. Charlo and Karin tell Fernanda that Gianni is merely a gay man in deep denial, but she has fallen in love with him, and in time Gianni offers to pay for her sex change operation -- and pledges to leave his wife for her. Gianni and Fernanda move in together, but soon both are developing cold feet; Fernanda becomes nervous with the onset of her surgery, and when Gianni's wife Lidia (Alessandra Acciai) confronts him and announces she's pregnant, he wonders if he may have made the wrong decision.

{"description": "Notoriously, and entirely appropriately, the original outline for Doug Naylor and Rob Grant's comedy sci-fi seriesRed Dwarfwas sketched on the back of a beer mat. When it finally appeared on British television in 1988, the show had clearly stayed true to its roots, mixing jokes about excessive curry consumption with affectionate parodies of classic sci-fi. Indeed, one of the show's most endearing and enduring features is its obvious respect for genre conventions, even as it gleefully subverts them. The scenario owes something to Douglas Adams's satiricalHitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, something toThe Odd Couple, and a lot more to the slacker sci-fi of John Carpenter'sDark Star. Behind the crew's constant bickering there lurks an impending sense that life, the universe, and everything are all someone's idea of a terrible joke.Later seasons broadened the show's horizons until at last its premise was so diluted as to be unrecognizable, but in the six episodes of the first season, the comedy is witty and intimate, focusing on characters and not special effects. Slob Dave Lister (Craig Charles) is the last human alive after a radiation leak wipes out the crew of the vast mining vesselRed Dwarf(Episode 1, \"The End\"). He bums around the spaceship with the perpetually uptight and annoyed hologram of his dead bunkmate, Arnold Rimmer (Chris Barrie, the show's greatest comedy asset), and a creature evolved from a cat (dapper Danny John Jules). They are guided rather haphazardly by Holly, the worryingly thick main computer (lugubrious Norman Lovett).--Mark Walker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00007AP32", "B0000WN0ZA", "B0000WN0ZU", "B0006Z2L0G", "B0006Z2L0Q", "B000EU1Q4U", "B000BVM1TQ", "B0026P3HPW", "B009Z59778", "B000BHHVNQ", "B002FQJT0Y", "B001DF681G", "B009Z5BPYG", "B002GP7ZV4", "B007AFC0W4", "B002BAW6FE", "B006LPHY6G", "0140174664", "B001NOMOS8", "B001YYQA0K", "B00006LPCK", "B002EOVX9W", "B00443FN1A", "B002GP7ZVO", "B002LFQIMQ", "B006LPHY5C", "B002LFPAUM", "B00FAVRFXE", "B002BAW6GI", "B0007G89FU", "0140143882", "B002LFQIMG", "B00004Z4TO", "B008R52LA2", "B0000DZSYB", "B00272NJ7K", "B000GI3RZ6", "B002LFQIN0", "B002BAW6H2", "B002BAW6FY", "B002D1XKB0", "B0000UJL96", "B000FIHN8O", "B001T46TCE", "0451452011", "B00HCK7THS", "B001AGXEBU", "B00008KA57", "B003L77GWE", "B001D2WUGG", "B002BIULNA", "B001QCWQ62", "B00BD6K54G", "B00GOC74QG", "B001Q9ECNA", "B000BP86Y6", "B001QCWQ5S", "B005PPMHO2", "B00064AME4", "B00AZMFJYA", "0140171509", "B0009X75J2", "B000Z7G87C", "B00005A1SY", "B00009MEJT", "B000HWZ4HU", "B004EXWGHY", "B004QOB8TS", "B000AYELJ2", "B000067FPC", "B001HUWQEA", "B000AJJNFE", "B000127LW2", "B00022FWEU", "B000RO9PTQ", "B00ECXJC28", "B002I9Z8BM", "B001QCWQ58", "B00D3ZJFBO", "B0000AQS0F", "B005SH65GI", "B001C71IGA", "B002I9Z8AS", "B000777I88", "B001O4C6NA", "B000LC4ZI0", "B00129W6LE", "B000QRI1GW", "B0089AD8IO", "B000KGGIRI", "B000FJH5MC", "B004QOB8SO"], "bought_together": ["B00007AP32", "B0000WN0ZA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000GI3RZ6", "B009Z59778", "B0006Z2L0G", "B0026P3HPW"]}, "price": 13.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 90398}, "asin": "B00007AP31", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F8ZQYDF9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Red Dwarf: Series I"}
{"description": "Trouble in Paradiseis the supreme example of \"the Lubitsch touch,\" that mastery of comic timing, diamond-cutter precision, and Continental sophistication that made Ernst Lubitsch a household name and the real star of every movie he directed. A pair of prodigiously talented, utterly charming scoundrels (Herbert Marshall, Miriam Hopkins) become personal assistants to an aristocratic Parisian widow (Kay Francis). Their target is her fortune, but she's such an elegant lady, and so agreeably smitten with her new right-hand man, that he's tempted to pursue a secondary objective. Marshall, Hopkins, and Francis aren't remembered as major stars, but in this enchanted moment they are sublime. Likewise the peerlessly pixilated Edward Everett Horton and Charlie Ruggles as the widow's stuffed-shirt suitors.Trouble in Paradiseis one of the best comedies ever made.

{"description": "A.M. Yoga for Beginners\"The morning is a precious time,\" says the narrator ofA.M. Yoga for Beginners. \"Just as the sun rises and falls, so do our natural rhythms. The morning is perfect time to open our bodies and center our minds.\" This 20-minute yoga practice with supple instructor Rodney Yee is the perfect way to start your day by energizing your body and calming your mind. Filmed on the beach at Maui at sunrise, the video starts with a 4-minute Conscious Relaxation focusing on breathing, then glides into a 14-minute series of yoga poses that are simultaneously relaxing and energizing. It ends with a 2-minute seated Guided Meditation to center your body and mind. Yee's instruction is detailed and gentle. The video is beautifully filmed: you watch the waves roll in as Yee demonstrates yoga poses on a sandy beach. The yoga practice awakens and stretches your muscles gently, leaving you balanced and focused. \"Yoga is the foundation of my day,\" says Yee. \"A few minutes in the morning will help give meaning to your day.\"--Joan PriceP.M. Yoga for Beginners\"The evening is the perfect time to calmly transition between being active and being quiet,\" says Patricia Walden, instructor ofP.M. Yoga for Beginners. \"One of the greatest gifts yoga has to offer is deep relaxation.\" This 20-minute program is designed to balance, calm, and revitalize you at the end of the day. It starts with centering poses: gentle stretches bringing awareness and quiet to your senses. Next are standing poses to release tension, increase circulation, expand the lungs, and help you breathe more deeply. Next, forward bends cool the body and bring quiet to the nervous system. The final restorative poses are so relaxing that you may fall asleep. Walden tells you not only how to do the poses, but what you should feel, and how to quiet your body and your mind. Instruction is soothing and explicit. Although this video is aimed at beginners, seldom are modifications given for the less flexible novice, so if any pose causes discomfort or seems impossible, don't push beyond your personal comfort level. The video was filmed on the windswept sands of Death Valley.--Joan Price", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000YV1L4E", "B001F76OKC", "B0044CM7YC", "B00062DKO0", "B0050W0UTO", "B00029QOTA", "B00D2YCLEO", "B000YV1L0S", "B0011Z5NLE", "B005S0STQE", "B000094J6K", "B00018WNHE", "B00008G76V", "B0000A2ZQE", "B000YV1L44", "B000067D1C", "B00F2H6R3K", "B00008G76O", "B000069HPZ", "B00008G76W", "B003H8F3A4", "B000ICLRKW", "B000A4T80O", "B00062DKNQ", "B00B0C409Y", "B00008G76Y", "B00002EPXL", "B001AYWY68", "B00ENAZ6RK", "B00A3Q46LA", "B000UUX2P0", "B002IVLWCE", "B00B0C23SE", "B000HZE7IY", "B0000A2ZR7", "B00DYZ80WI", "B00GST8P9A", "B0011Z5NL4", "B000H8RVSO", "B003ZZ7TLA", "B009B82D2A", "0875969216", "B00007GZS0", "B008SDJNPY", "B008DL4HWU", "094567189X", "B001GP5TLI", "B00006RCNF", "B00B0C5Q4M", "B00AJFOEFS", "B00004XOX2", "B005QUQRDS", "B00DH2VCJ6", "B007NU62R0", "1591791847", "B0093URN9Y", "B00ADO9C9I", "B00429C1VQ", "B000RE94M4", "B0031XYLWG", "B001AYWY6I", "B0062YQN4U", "B000B5871I", "B0012KK6QK", "B000BRM992", "B001HAO8NM", "B0014CSNDY", "B0001WTWYC", "B0062NTKVE", "B00019U4QA", "B00FLID5EO", "1492855235", "B0002444ZQ", "B000BYW6Z2", "B001DHC7TG", "B00525X9A6", "B00004TKIC", "B000WOSAUQ", "B00EANPFMQ", "B000XQ02R2", "B00ADO9CHA", "B000067D1D", "1572241268", "B000RXZL18", "B003U2KEM4", "B001FPKJNM", "B005VT6IYC", "B0099115XW", "B00A3Q32J2", "B0047WMPVO", "B00FMIYSTO", "B00005M1XE", "B00007D00L", "B000LSBXGQ", "B0067WLHB6", "B004CRR9IS", "1930485298", "B009AVCAGC", "1450400248", "B00GUODUAM"], "bought_together": ["B001F76OKC", "B000YV1L4E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000YV1L4E", "B001F76OKC", "B0044CM7YC", "B005S0STQE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5905}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 13.5, "brand": "Gaiam", "asin": "B00007JME6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51zpBleyKjL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A.M. and P.M.

{"description": "TheIdentityDVD features are not quite as enticing as they sound.  Of chief interest is the extended branched version of the film (available in widescreen only), but there's only one added scene (an interesting but not critical minute-long sequence that would have been the first conference-room scene), and the differences in the alternate ending are so subtle that you'll miss them if you literally blink a few times.  There's no question it could affect audience perception, but unlike most alternate endings, it doesn't affect the actual outcome.  (Seespoilerfor more information.)  The four deleted scenes (which don't include either of the above-mentioned additions) aren't that exciting, and the optional director commentary notes that these deletions generally served to cut moments of character and comic relief in favor of moving the story along, which is one reason the film runs a brisk 90 minutes. James Mangold's director commentary on the feature is good, though, as he discusses such matters as the logistics of the perpetual downpour and a crucial bit of dialogue removed from the film's climax.  Considering that downpour and the contrasting darks and lights of the film, picture quality is good, and the thunder claps sound great in 5.1 sound so there are no complaints about the DVD's presentation of the film itself.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000TJ6PBK", "B00006AUJR", "B0009YA3OA", "B000DZ7YN8", "B00005JNY3", "B00AADAK5W", "1558908382", "B00008K77D", "B0002DB54A", "B000RGN2JI", "B00AEBB8NI", "B000P0I4O4", "B00003CXZ4", "B004ZNFTDQ", "B0015XHQVC", "B00026ZD04", "B00014NEZI", "B003LR5BD0", "B00092ZLSK", "B004SIP92O", "B00000JGHL", "B003VA3JUO", "B00BNH9NCU", "B00DZP1C2W", "B00I45844W", "B004YCKKFK", "B00011CZRE", "B0002234LS", "B001HVZOB6", "B005S9EJ8W", "B000A2UBN4", "B00HOGBXS6", "B000OYC7BW", "B0004Z31OS", "B00AEBB89W", "B00AEFXW8I", "B00009OWJY", "B002NZK5RI", "B00AEFXEGS", "B00007AJF8", "B003ASLJQ8", "B000R4SMCW", "B000069HZP", "B00003CXGA", "B00005V9HH", "B0001FR3IQ", "B00005JPT0", "B000SK5Z20", "B00008YJDK", "B0013D8LBS", "6305238065", "B0021L8UFI", "B004P7CN7W", "078322799X", "B001OQCV2E", "B0002WT4OE", "B00B6OEB18", "B00003CXKM", "B004SIP9RO", "B000RZIGUE", "B004B3PBFQ", "B004LWZW24", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00096S49Y", "B000LC55F2", "0783240295", "B00009L1TA", "B0034G4P30", "B002O3Z4WK", "B00005JLO8", "B001ILFUBE", "B00005JKIS", "B004SIP9MY", "6305718954", "B000ALM40I", "B0001Z52RU", "B0010X73ZG", "B000A5045Q", "B00005JMWP", "B00005JN2Z", "B000F5WR4W", "B0000648X0", "B0021L8UPS", "B00AEBBA2W", "6301971345", "B002UJIY7A", "B0006IIKQW", "B00B96TGQS", "B004BLJQOK", "B00AEFXKZ8", "6304806434", "B001NPD9LS", "B000U1ZV76", "B003L20IEW", "B00596WFE4", "B000GCFO0I", "B00005UQ9W", "B000053UIF", "B0000YTOL2"], "bought_together": ["B000TJ6PBK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000TJ6PBK", "B0012Q7M02", "B00006AUJR", "B00AEBBA2W"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30202}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.73, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00008EY9G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RKTbv5kkL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Identity"}

{"description": "Kate Hudson twinkles as the heroine of How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days. She's a magazine writer assigned to date a guy, make all the mistakes girls make that drive guys away (being clingy, talking in baby-talk and so on) and records the process like a sociological experiment. However, the guy she picks-- Matthew McConaughey--is an advertising executive who's just bet that he can make a woman fall in love with him in 10 days; if he succeeds, he'll win a huge account that will make his career. The set-up is completely absurd, but the collision of their efforts to woo and repel creates some pretty funny scenes. McConaughey's easy charm and Hudson's lightweight impishness play well together and the plot, though strictly Hollywood formula, chugs along efficiently. At moments Hudson seems to channel her mother, Goldie Hawn, to slightly unnerving effect. --Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00007E2F5", "B00003CXSM", "B00AEFXWXI", "B0012KJ0DK", "B002K0WBXW", "B0015I2RT8", "B00164KYV4", "B004EPZ070", "B0000897EG", "B00447L4KA", "B002P413IC", "B00005JN3W", "B002ZG988M", "B000MQC9H4", "B002ZG989G", "B00AEBB8NS", "B000A343RI", "B001TUZD8O", "B00006ZXSL", "B00005O5CM", "B001OQCUZM", "B004EPZ0BG", "B00081U7HC", "B004SIP9X8", "B003Y5H574", "B001Y8DJVE", "6304765266", "B00008NRI7", "B000YDBPAM", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00AEBB8R4", "B00AEFYQE2", "B000683VI4", "B0000524E5", "B00AEBB9WI", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B00AEFYM2S", "B000YAA68C", "B00AMEZDJW", "B0007PLLBU", "B00006ZXSK", "B002ZG984Q", "B0009OL7Z4", "B002ZG9968", "B0036TGSIK", "B000023VTP", "B003BV8ICC", "B00AEFYWQY", "B00AEBB8YW", "B000J4QW7W", "B003B3V0N4", "B00005JG6N", "B0000DIXDR", "B004SEUJK0", "B005LAIGSM", "B000ELJAEM", "B0001Z3TXE", "B000957O82", "B001OQCUYI", "B004SIP9RO", "B004SIP8LG", "B003NHRIVQ", "B0013D8LHC", "B00AKGG6JS", "B00008WJD6", "B003Y5H524", "B000J103OI", "B0050MB584", "B00006ZXSO", "B00006FMUW", "B000HEWEE4", "6305236569", "B000XJD33O", "B002ZG99UE", "B0035Q637K", "B00466HN7M", "B001L9EXTS", "B00386EZKE", "B001C5LLQ4", "076780421X", "B000J3OTSM", "B000E6EHE0", "B004LWZW9C", "B00005JM55", "B000EMGICS", "B000CEV3KU", "B008JFUUIA", "B00003CXMP", "B000P0J0DS", "B000TZJBPQ", "B0000AOV4I", "B005Z9MFRC", "B0000D8L1K", "B000HCPS94", "B00E8RKHWW", "B00AEFY4CG", "B004SIP8JI", "B0001AVZA8", "B005LAIGXW", "B000Y7U93C"], "bought_together": ["B00007E2F5", "B002K0WBXW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002K0WBXW", "B002ZG989G", "B00007E2F5", "B00447L4KA"]}, "price": 14.16, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 346003}, "asin": "B00008KDGZ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512083xZEbL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"}

{"description": "Jack Bauer is having another one of his \"very bad days\" in the second season of the groundbreaking real-time thriller24. Once again the hours are ticking by with more guaranteed cliffhangers than a convention of mountain climbers. Holed up in a Los Angeles condo and estranged from his daughter, Jack is no longer on the government payroll; unfortunately for him, this small fact doesn't seem to matter to President David Palmer and the NSA, who call him back in to the CTU and give him 24 hours to infiltrate a terrorist organization that is planning to detonate a dirty bomb in the city of angels. All Jack wants is to get his daughter out of the city, unfortunately Kim's new employer, the abusive father of the child she is nannying, has other ideas.Fans of theoriginalwon't be disappointed, as there are more than enough shock moments in the first few hours to hint at the climactic build-up to come, while newcomers can quickly get involved in the lives of Jack and his family. There are some new characters to bolster the veteran cast and, interestingly (although not surprisingly), Jack's character has taken an altogether darker, more psychopathic turn. The danger the characters find themselves in also has a much more global, not to mention topical, impetus, grounded as it is in the war against terrorism.  Although the territory is more familiar this time around, this second season is just as much a high-tension, taut, adrenalin-fuelled ride as the first, and one that will have you glued to your TV for the next 24 hours.--Kristen Bowditch", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002XVQSU", "B000NDEXK2", "B000B837XI", "B000ICLRKC", "B000NDEXKW", "B000MR8W92", "B001L5SRJE", "B002ZCY7SW", "B001DMVZOE", "B0015QWZ8S", "B002ZCY7TG", "0756632277", "B0001WHXM0", "B00G4RCXPI", "B00KPP6ZLS", "B0000DIJNU", "B000FIMG68", "B000AJJNFE", "B00005JNOG", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B001OQCVFG", "B002N5N5QQ", "B00HT850YW", "B003FSTN52", "B000Q6GUW0", "B0049P1VHS", "B00ECHBSP8", "B004UXVDJA", "B0058YPJ2W", "B00J5LXT44", "B0044E9JU0", "B001GCUER0", "B00IWTVDUW", "B002ZCY8CC", "B0058YPGSY", "B0019L21GA", "B003L77GK6", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00HEPE6MM", "B0024FAR5M", "B00KPP6R9S", "B00005JOC9", "B004EXWGHY", "B00AIBZMD6", "B009LDD1H6", "B000P6YNSE", "B000EWBNMI", "B00ITAQ2T6", "B001AI776G", "B0036EH3XE", "B0089AD8IO", "B000YABIQ6", "B00FGEO9NE", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B009LDCZ7I", "B00IKM5LXG", "B000HEVZ9E", "B003F3NDWG", "B00AB65RUG", "B00HF98SJY", "B000BF0C8E", "B000BGR1B4", "B00E8OMZGG", "B00JA3RVG4"], "bought_together": ["B000NDEXK2", "B0002XVQSU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000NDEXK2", "B000ICLRKC", "B0002XVQSU", "B000MR8W92"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 4639}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 39.69, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B00008YGRU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516918NBNNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "24: Season 2"}

{"description": "When newly-commissioned SS Lieutenant Kurt Gerstein (Ulrich Tukur) witnesses the chemical disinfectant he's helped perfect being used to systematically murder interred Jews, he has no choice but to act. The only sympathetic ear Gerstein is able to find is that of a young Father Riccardo (Amelie's Mathieu Kassovitz), a priest with deep ties to the Vatican. While Riccardo takes on the obstructive Vatican hierarchy, Gerstein must walk a tightrope between documenting and enabling the atrocities his fellow SS officers cold-bloodedly commit. As the two unlikely allies fight to reveal the truth to the Church and the world, they discover that the fates of a man of conscience committing treason for the sake of humanity and a man of God committing heresy to thwart genocide are ultimately the same.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000087EYX", "B002IVDLH8", "B000PMGS7C", "B00005QAQI", "B00008RV0G", "B00005BJWC", "B00005YUO1", "B0070KCJLQ", "B0001DMW9S", "B00IKM5OTW", "B00JPJC8RK", "B00D3XM7H0", "B00049QJ9I", "B00IS6WPXS", "B00FL2EWYM", "B004EI2NWM", "B001UFE8PM", "B00ID8H8EW", "B004KL0OVU", "B000H5V8H2", "B00J0IN6Z4", "B00JEEZSUA", "B0000BWVCR", "B000KB48NE", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B00D3XMA9A", "B00007KQ9X", "B0047UJBJA", "B0002CX1NY", "B000FDFSYA", "B00HV2BG44", "B007UI0CIA", "B0012QE4PI", "B000YKT4BW", "B00EO2I6XS", "B0030ZIZTK", "B00H96KFV2", "B009XTF8NI", "B00JJRLFTU", "B00DPUB5LK", "B000TGCR38", "B002KECJZ8", "B00JVQ7PWU", "B00018D4PO", "B00DL48BM6", "B0036TGSV2", "B00JJRLFVS", "B00007ELEV", "B00C2535TE", "B00I116MZ2", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B003JLL2RW", "B000FVQLRA", "B00097DY66", "B00BC1UPRO", "B002WBYDR6", "B00005AUJR", "B005OTGS4E", "B00IVLR9JA", "B000093NQZ", "B00INB7UO2", "B00J5LXMTG", "B00IAR2CFG", "B00J2PQZBC", "B000AQ69R2", "B00H0EN948", "B004H9ZQ4K", "B00ID8HATK", "B00KDK64DY", "B00BWH6DK6", "B0055UBGEO", "B00006IUHK", "B003PMWF62", "B000OVLBGC", "B005HQBO9I", "B009XTF8MY", "B003K1H14E", "B0007R4SYU", "B00005JMLR", "B000TLTCPO", "B00G15MDI0", "B0049TC8CQ", "B002QP145C", "B0007ZEOPK", "B002Q5O6Y8", "B00AEFXRRO", "B000NA6CQ8", "B003YKYX7Y", "0375414347", "B005DKS1TE", "B00ENMZK1A", "B0041KKZIM", "B000HC2PLS", "B00IVLR9LI", "B002TQKL66", "B0002CR04A", "B002BWP4A6", "B002ID09BM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AIBZMD6", "B00JEEZSUA", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B003AWRMBU"]}, "price": 19.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 200647}, "asin": "B00009W0W4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51924YKWW5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Amen"}
{"description": "UFOwas Gerry Anderson's first live-action TV series after a decade of producing such children's animated classics asStingray(1963) andThunderbirds(1964). The premise ofUFO, which ran for a single season of 26 episodes in 1970, was like a more serious version of Anderson'sCaptain Scarlet(1967): in the near future of 1980, a high-tech secret organization, SHADO, waged covert war against mysterious alien attackers. Ed Bishop played the American head of SHADO--he had been previously featured inCaptain Scarletand Anderson'sDoppelganger(1969)--though in all other respects this was a thoroughly British production. As with all Anderson series,UFOevidenced remarkable technological inventiveness and groundbreaking production values, coupled with startling lapses in fundamental logic too numerous to list.Much more adult in story and content than earlier Anderson productions, and surprisingly dark with its pragmatic view of human nature and downbeat endings, the show now seems like a forerunner ofThe X-Filesand the equally short-livedDark Skies(1996). Barry Gray's memorable theme and atmospheric music greatly enhanced the overall impact. Stylishly made, though terribly sexist by current standards and featuring eye-catching costumes more fitted for a campy dress party than the front line of a futuristic war, this cult classic eventually evolved intoSpace: 1999(1975).TheUFODVDs have been beautifully designed and produced. The mono sound is exceptionally strong, and the restored and remastered picture is almost unbelievably good for a 1970 TV show. With barely a flaw anywhere, the episodes look so clear, colorful, and detailed that they could have been filmed last week. This eight-disc megaset features all 26 episodes.--Gary S.

{"description": "Though it bears little resemblance to the original 1969 thriller starring Michael Caine, the 2003 remake ofThe Italian Jobstands on its own as a caper comedy that's well above average. The title's a misnomer--this time it's actually a Los Angeles job--but the action's just as exciting as it propels a breezy tale of honor and dishonor among competing thieves. Inheriting Caine's role as ace heist-planner Charlie Croker, Mark Wahlberg plays straight-man to a well-cast team of accomplices, including Mos Def, Jason Statham, and scene-stealer Seth Green in a variation of the role originally played by Noel Coward. As the daughter of Croker's ill-fated mentor (Donald Sutherland), Charlize Theron is recruited to double-cross a double-crosser (Edward Norton in oily villain mode), and once again, speedily versatile Mini Coopers play a pivotal role in director F. Gary Gray's exhilarating car-chase climax. It's perhaps the greatest product placement in movie history, and just as fun the second time around.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB86A", "B00AEFY0XE", "B0000AUHPB", "B0019EXZY4", "B00004Z4WR", "B005LAIGLE", "B001MTYRKC", "B000ZS8GWQ", "B000J3OTT6", "B00AEBB8LA", "B000P0J0BK", "B00BB67UNW", "B004HO6HWA", "B004P7CMVE", "0767818024", "B004ULNJIU", "B003Q6D2B4", "B001F12J0C", "B001QB9H10", "B004EPYZP8", "B008E70EES", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B0062P3392", "B001TODCII", "B002GSXKP6", "B000BTITKS", "B0010YVCB6", "B000K7UBSO", "078322933X", "B001ILHY1I", "B0007P0XBO", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B003UESJHO", "B000AP04FG", "B0002ZDVEU", "B000JYW5BE", "B000W1V5VU", "B00008AOVL", "B00005JLIF", "B000093FLA", "6305657947", "6304711891", "B003L20IG0", "B00DU22OI6", "B005LAIGRS", "B008JFURII", "B002XMGGK6", "B002DU39GW", "B00HEPC0TS", "B005LAIILM", "B000P0J0C4", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000W9DTG6", "B000M341QE", "B002NZK5UU", "B000X1Z0C4", "B00AEFZ2DG", "B000FKO5QK", "B001UV4XGA", "B00023B1LC", "B000GFLKF8", "B00005JLSB", "B000ENC5YW", "B00AEFY5B6", "B001J710Z2", "B002ZG99H2", "B000VWYJ86", "B00005JN0T", "B002ZG999U", "6305428115", "B00000JGNP", "B00140PK82", "B002ZG9864", "B002GIBVVQ", "B004H83IFK", "B00BEIYLO8", "B00005UQ9T", "6304806434", "0783240295", "B005LAIGXW", "B00003CY0V", "B000KF0GWW", "B000P0J0EW", "B00005JLX2", "B002VECM6S", "B002ZG97RE", "B002O3Z4XY", "B000E5N684", "B002ZG980U", "B00005B6JZ", "B001N44BVQ", "B000FKO3WG", "B00005JKBC", "B007REV4T8", "B00E8RKHWW", "B001DZOC6Y", "B0012KJ0DK", "B002GHHHP6", "B00005JN0W", "B00AQSN7HE"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBB86A", "B00AEFY0XE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000AUHPB", "B00AEBB86A", "B00004Z4WR", "B005LAIIHG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8732}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B0000B1OFL", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X762iDLcL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Italian Job"}
{"description": "This 2DVD set is an incredible value -- it has over 5 1/2 hours of great footage for around 15 bucks.  Whoever put this documentary together did a tremendous job of coming up with basically all of the actual footage of key plays and moments in the history of the World Series that you could ask for (even all the way back to the beginning), and tracked down interview footage from the key participants. I rated the 2DVD Yankee history set as also being essential -- basically, this makes an excellent companion.  The World Series set might appeal to baseball fans in general a bit more, because even though it has tons of Yankee footage (obviously), there is of footage of most of the guys you'd want to see (Mays, Aaron, Bonds, Williams, Brooklyn Dodgers/NY Giants, etc.)  Very compelling viewing, whether you're a novice fan or someone who has seen decades worth of baseball - it brought back a ton of great memories and makes you realize how often there are really great, historic moments in virtually every Series.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003S1UNZU", "B00005Y6YH", "B000FBFYXC", "B005ENCIUI", "B008LW25CK", "B005HQ5SLI", "B004JWY3U8", "B001ILFUSM", "B00008G697", "B008I5OI0W", "B000FQIRZE", "157912576X", "B000RZS5VE", "B001SLNPSY"], "bought_together": ["B00005Y6YH"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008LW25CK", "B002AS45SS", "B003S1UNZU", "1402747705"]}, "price": 28.5, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 229084}, "asin": "B0000C8261", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511V0BGRFEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Major League Baseball - 100 Years of the World Series (Collector's Edition)"}

{"description": "Like its fellow HBO seriesSex and the City, this half-hour comedy broke some TV rules and went from critics' darling to an award-winning series in three years.Curb Your Enthusiasmis the brainchild of star-creator Larry David who co-createdSeinfeldand was the basis for the easily rattled George Costanza (who was played by Jason Alexander). Like George, David has a tendency to speak too much, blow things out of proportion, and, most often, fail in the end (and often liking it that way). David's new show is also like its predecessor: it's about \"nothing\" except following the day-to-day ramblings of a sometime writer and comic (this time in L.A.). Eternal questions stemming from universal daily dilemmas are honed to perfect comedic absurdity. A notable exception is the show is only scripted by plot; much of the action is improvised. The first season starts with a one-hour mockumentary following David's return to stand-up for the first time in years; the other 10 episodes follow a more traditional sit-com setup.David plays \"himself\" (as does his friend, Richard Lewis) although his manager and wife are played by comedians Jeff Garlin and Cheryl Hines. Although this first season is a comedic gem, one can't take more than an episode or two at a time--it's acidic, biting comedy. The episodes are often built like a house of cards, which the irritable David will surely collapse by the end. Like another caustic TV character, Dabney Colman's Buffalo Bill (1983-84), Larry David is not for everybody.--Doug ThomasStills fromCurb Your Enthusiasm- The Complete First Season(Click for larger image)&nbsp;&nbsp;", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001US8EE", "B00067BCB8", "B0009WIE34", "B000FL7CAU", "B000VXK6Z0", "B002OOWKSA", "B003L77GMO", "B00EHJC7I8", "B00005JLEX", "B002LMV7RA", "B0002UE1WQ", "B000RW3VDE", "B008BLCP0S", "B008LCRAFC", "B008LCRABQ", "B008LCRA98", "B008LCRA7K", "B00AS86VFM", "B002LMV7QG", "B0002PYS7Y", "B0007YXRCW", "B00G4RIOOW", "B0018RKEQE", "B00020X852", "B00G4RIPE6", "B0013FSL0C", "B00EIJTLK4", "B001IBIDLI", "B0002ERXC2", "B008LCRAC0", "B005SEDI5M", "B00EHJC9AE", "B003L77GJM", "1929132360", "B00BGI07NK", "B000GGSMC6", "B0008KLV96", "B000A88ESW", "B00000G02H", "B0090XPH06", "B0007QS324", "B00J5LXT44", "B003R4ZMOA", "B000CQQID0", "B0058EE6NK", "B00ICR6SBI", "B009LDCVJU", "B00EEDNR9A", "B007WGDC7I", "B003Y5HWJU", "B00EPH8S58", "B001L1S1PS", "1592402305", "B000GETTKM", "B001DJLCRC", "B00608CD3I", "B00HUCF420", "B00JAQJNN0", "B005S97V82", "B0041KKZKA", "B000A9QKRI", "B008FRJDVC", "B000EXDS7K", "B001OQCVFG", "B006CR2OOA", "B000HRMAPE", "B00BUYWJEA", "B0006FO5LO", "1592408265", "B000P0J0D8", "B000B5XOR0", "B000RBA6CO", "B00C0UO1EY", "B0033WH6MW", "B00BI7ZAM2", "B0060MYKYY", "B0009A40ES", "B00019PDNY", "B003L77G06", "B002JVWQSW", "B002OOWKSU", "B000YABIQ6", "B009DA74D4", "B005LAJ16I", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B009LDD54K", "B0092QH902", "B003ES5JH4", "B0049AF6UG", "B00FOHHMWI", "B002AMUDK8", "B0019N8P2W", "B00GV8AZRI", "B005D0OHA6", "B001RTSPVY", "B0058YPG1G", "B008CFZQQS", "B0000640VJ", "B009LDD4BO"], "bought_together": ["B0001US8EE", "B00067BCB8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00067BCB8", "B0001US8EE", "B003L77GMO", "B0009WIE34"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14356}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 20.99, "brand": "EMI", "asin": "B0000E2PVR", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZUW6F78XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Curb Your Enthusiasm: Season 1"}

{"description": "Based on the bestseller by John Grisham,Runaway Juryis a slick thriller that's exciting enough to overcome the gaps in its plot. The ultimate target has been changed: Grisham's legal assault on the tobacco industry was switched to the hot-button issue of gun control (no doubt to avoid comparison toThe Insider) in a riveting expos&#xE9; of jury-tampering. Gene Hackman plays the ultra-cynical, utterly unscrupulous pawn of the gun-makers, using an expert staff and advanced electronics to hand-pick a New Orleans jury that will return a favorable verdict; Dustin Hoffman (making his first screen appearance with real-life former roommate Hackman) defends the grieving widow of a gun-shooting victim with idealistic zeal, while maverick juror John Cusack and accomplice Rachel Weisz play both ends against the middle in a personal quest to hold gun-makers accountable. It's riveting stuff, even when it's obvious that Grisham and director Gary Fleder have glossed over any details that would unravel the plot's intricate design.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783226942", "B000P5FH3K", "B002NZK5R8", "B00AEFXYJA", "B002NZK5UU", "0767810872", "B002NZK5VO", "B0000694XY", "630542828X", "B00AEFXT1S", "B0006HBZBA", "B0045HCJ8K", "B0000C3I8M", "B004EPYZP8", "B0010YSD7W", "B00096S49Y", "B000063US3", "B000R4SMCW", "1558908382", "B001NY4WYC", "B003ASLJIQ", "6305428115", "B00005B6JZ", "B00005JL8F", "B00005UQ9T", "B00008EY9G", "B00008K77D", "0800141806", "B00005JPT0", "B00003CXFV", "B000P0I4O4", "B000CEV3M8", "B00441GYPG", "0790732149", "B000SFOW8I", "B000TJ6PBK", "0783240295", "B001I2EQUY", "B000055Y0Y", "B000NTMA0Q", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B002AT8KAG", "0790730979", "B00003CY5G", "B0038Z5T4Q", "B004SIP9RO", "B004YCKKFK", "B002AS464Q", "B00AMSM9DG", "0783226888", "B00AADAK5W", "B0031OCY2E", "B002DU39GW", "B00000K3TU", "B002LMV7R0", "B0013D8LBS", "B000GFLKF8", "B000CEXEWA", "B00008L3S6", "B00005ATZT", "B00AEBB9UK", "6304806434", "B002AT8K9W", "B00AEFXEGS", "B003ASLJQ8", "B0043X1FNQ", "B000BNX3B4", "B001CC7PLM", "B002QW7AMG", "B000JYW5BE", "B000Y11B8U", "B001HVZOB6", "B00BLN4UKQ", "B005NKIPUY", "B00015YVDG", "B00H91LWDC", "0792844874", "6305657947", "B003L20IG0", "0780618548", "B00DWZHTOU", "B003Q6D2B4", "B000ENC5YW", "B00GUO2SKA", "B0010YVCB6", "B00009WVSL", "B000G5SILC", "B000F8DV1M", "B00FQRZ6EM", "B000OYAT3U", "B00AEFXIIW", "B008JFURII", "B00005JNQA", "B002O3Z4XY", "B000059XTK", "B00005JN5E", "B001ECDVK4", "B000K7VHQ4", "B00000JGHL"], "bought_together": ["B000P5FH3K", "0783226942"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001I2EQUY", "B000P5FH3K", "B00AEFXYJA", "B002NZK5VO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 38867}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.67, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00014NEZI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X52Z0CBSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Runaway Jury (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Britney Spears: In the Zoneis a busy batch of Britney-mania, much of it featuring Spears in crisp dance numbers supplemented by behind-the-scenes glimpses and chatter. The heart of this DVD is an ABC television special featuring toned-down but still sexy performances of \"Toxic,\" \"Breathe on Me,\" and \"I'm a Slave 4 U.\" A fun highlight is Spears's hip-hop collaboration with the Ying Yang Twins on \"(I Got That) Boom Boom,\" one of the few numbers in the star's stage repertoire with a little room for spontaneity. Between songs one finds Spears gushing over her grandfather, praising her entourage, describing the emotional toll of being in the public eye, and, most interestingly, talking a little about writing songs. Also included here is footage from Spears's Times Square performance on MTV, a couple of videos and related featurettes, and a CD including alternative mixes of \"Toxic\" and \"Me Against the Music.\"--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005UKKF", "B00064AM62", "B00005RDAF", "B001T46TUG", "B000YZ7UEU", "B00002ZMNO", "B000A88F22", "B0000DD7LB", "B002R68U7A", "B00000G1IL", "B000WQ9UA8", "B00004SCX6", "B00G3Q6VPS", "B005TQAI6G", "B001GO09MI", "B00005OM4N", "B005LY3VRO", "B0006FO8RA", "B00005JKWM", "B00FAY6IP2", "B000051S4N", "B004KSQN7C", "B00EIEPQPI", "B003O5MOBG", "B0085BHHOS", "B00006AMW2", "B005TQACLC", "B00BD4K4NK", "097245750X", "B002P75AAG", "B00D6CPTMS", "0609807013", "B00756GKBA", "B007SBHKNE", "B00IP78OCG", "B006B9F6CQ", "B000G759LW", "B00K57K2JM", "B00I0O9SLA", "B009AVFSFC", "B002HNA95E", "B0000TWMMA", "B0014BEDBG", "B00000JY9M", "0451409701", "B00006CXXU", "B00005IA82", "B000ALJ0BE", "B000BKDOCA", "B00EW9GQR6", "B009B4ZEKM", "B003I64748", "B000GCFO0S", "B0017ZB8M6", "B0015D3Z4O", "B000KGGLCU", "B003K025V4", "B0031SBOKI", "B0042RUMH8", "B000BRD6MG", "B002R68U7K", "B00000JOWI", "B0000542LF", "B00013RC34", "B000EHQ8B4", "B00DW5IKJI", "B000QEIO2Q", "1595551565", "B00302R47W", "B00026L8YE", "B0001B0VL6", "B000L96B58", "B000002NJS", "B003IPC5SO", "B00008AY3N", "B00004WJDG", "B00E3D7WGU", "B000WTVZIK", "B003IMV8IK", "B000002LGQ", "B008SLAXGO", "B0002PYS5Q", "B000ICLRL6", "B000CNE0RY", "B00005JN0Z", "B002ZFQCZU", "B000065B4R", "B002JM1VJG", "B00428ZRFE", "B0041OOJNU", "B009P5S11G", "B007V4QKPC", "B000N8ND12", "B0000DJZ83", "B000002MUW", "B000B8QEZG", "B00009RDFZ", "B000VI70X6", "B002QGUFWE"], "bought_together": ["B00005UKKF", "B00064AM62"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000DD7LB", "B00005UKKF", "B00064AM62", "B000WQ9UA8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 41432}, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Adult Contemporary"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Dance Pop"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Vocal Pop"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 10.03, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0001BXYUG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518PRQmnnFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "In the Zone (+ Bonus CD)"}

{"description": "In this extraordinary production, storyteller Alan Bleasdale broadens the scope of Charles Dickens' classic tale of an orphan in 19th century England&#x97;and the characters who influence his destiny.Oliver's mother, Agnes, struggles against the tragic circumstances that ultimately leave Oliver a penniless orphan. At the Parish Workhouse, he is forced by other boys to ask for more food, and as a result, is sold as an apprentice to a miserly undertaker. He runs away and is taken in by master thief Fagin, who is in league with a murderous pair determined to see that Oliver never inherits the fortune he deserves.

{"description": "TheBabylon 5pilot movieThe Gatheringwas originally broadcast in 1993 a full year ahead of the regular show. A somewhat dull tale of an attempt to assassinate Koch, the Vorlon ambassador toB5, the feature served to introduce Commander Jeffery Sinclair (Michael O'Hare) and Security Chief Michael Garibaldi (Jerry Doyle) as well as familiarize the audience with the unique environment of a five-mile-long space station in the year 2257. Missing many of the main cast, and suffering from a leaden pace and mediocre music score, series creator J Michael Straczynski later improvedThe Gatheringby tightening the cut for a special edition (the version released on DVD), adding some deleted character moments and commissioning a new score from series composer Christopher Franke.Four new TV movies were part of the deal to syndicateBabylon 5.In the Beginningis a prelude set 10 years beforeBabylon 5, telling the story of the Earth-Minbari war. Told retrospectively, many of the mysteries revealed gradually in the main series are recounted, making the show a collection of spoilers for newcomers while adding little for established fans. It is effective to see events only previously talked about, and enjoyable to have most of the main cast playing younger versions of themselves.River of Soulsis a self-contained adventure featuring a return of the Soul Hunters from Season One, whileThirdspaceoffers a spectacular Lovecraftian space opera which slots into the saga after the end of the Shadow War.A Call to Armsis the most important of the TV films, laying the ground for the future TV seriesCrusade. Set five years after the Shadow War, it tells the story of a Drahk revenge attack on Earth.

{"description": "As the fourth season ofAngelstarts, everything is still as we left it: Angel has been sunk to the bottom of the sea in an iron box by his inexplicable and vindictive son Connor and Cordelia has been summoned to higher realms to await orders. Gunn and Fred are left in the Hyperion Hotel, unsure about what has happened to their friends, and Lilah is working hard to seduce Wesley to the dark side. In the first few episodes, some of this is resolved but it's almost immediately replaced by far worse crises: prophesies of doom accumulate more rapidly even than usual in this wonderfully gloomy show and a horned rock-like beast rains fire on Los Angeles. This last year isAngel's most tightly dramatic season yet--with a story arc of surprising intensity punctuated by the show's usual wit and sexiness.Season 4 is presented on DVD in Dolby 2.0 Surround Sound and anamorphic widescreen. It comes with insightful, and often hilarious, commentaries on seven of the 22 episodes as well as featurettes--a series overview, profiles of the characters of Jasmine and the Beast, a farewell to the Hyperion Hotel (the characters' base for three seasons), and a discussion of the apocalypse that Angel has to deal with from episode 7 onwards).--Roz Kaveney", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000I0QLS2", "B000I0QLRI", "B000I0QLR8", "B000I0QLQY", "B000EHSVN2", "B000EHSVMS", "B000EHSVM8", "B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVLE", "B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVKK", "B0006IUE16", "B0009W5J4Q", "B007H9CNOI", "B000CCBCGM", "B0024FAR66", "B000B5XOW0", "B0046XG48O", "B000OIOPHC", "B000JLTRIG", "B000RO6JYK", "B001992NWO", "B000ERVJM2", "B00AMDA2QC", "B00006J3WH", "B001L1S1OY", "B002JVWR4A", "1593078226", "B000HT3P60", "B0053O89IS", "B002JVWR4U", "B000GG4Y6O", "B009LDCXNY", "B00HUPC5X8", "B0000AQS0F", "B000BOH990", "B00JF5GAZA", "B009LDD4V4", "B000FP2OPY", "B000X5SPBI", "B000HD1482", "B002CLKP00", "B003L77G8I", "B00133QNSG", "B002JVWRAO", "B000N6SE4U", "B000G1R4SO", "159307784X", "B000T9OP7G", "B0011FLGZQ", "B000QDLSR0", "B003L77GGK", "B00008KA57", "B006LG74Q0", "B000FIMG68", "B00001R3O1", "B0009JE6FC", "B001MVWRMU", "1569717516", "B001FB4W0C", "B009LDCWWG", "B002N5N5MK", "B001B7CNZ6", "1595826106", "B000NOKFGW", "B000F8O2PG", "B0001JXPPC", "B000O77SMW", "B00020H9NO", "B000R7GKQE", "B005X4P3DC", "B0085KGG96", "B003BV8I7C", "B004YM6JI2", "B00006FD9N", "B000BOH98G", "0785168370", "B000PMFRTC", "B001M5UDGS", "B000CNE0SS", "1613770596", "1593078269", "B00133QNS6", "B00IWTVDUW", "B001MVWRN4", "B00243FQFA", "B000A5045Q", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B001MVWRMK", "B0008FPJ7Q", "B00BBXSPES", "B001AQO43M", "B0024FAD9C", "B000BOH986", "159307963X", "B00133QNRW", "B003L77GH4", "B000GG4Y28", "B002XD0J80", "B00008KGT0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000I0QLRI", "B000I0QLR8", "B000I0QLQY", "B000I0QLS2"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 165905}, "asin": "B0002HS74C", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PP1E7PZZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Angel - Season Four"}

Fitzgerald (The Believer's Ryan Gosling) is the killer. But why did he kill? Now that the deed is done, Leland is staying in a detention center. Everybody, but especially new teacher Pearl Madison (Don Cheadle), wants to know why he killed the mentally challenged brother of girlfriend Becky (Jena Malone). After all, Leland seemed to genuinely like the kid. Leland is just as confused (and can't remember committing the act), but he reveals more and more clues as he gradually opens up to Pearl. His estranged novelist father Albert (Kevin Spacey), meanwhile, just wants to spin another bestseller out of his son's story.

{"description": "Will & Gracestrode into its third season with the kind of  cultural cache TV executives would kill for. These 22 episodes are  littered with hip celebrity guest stars, from Ellen DeGeneres to Sandra  Bernhard to Cher, and the performances of the core quartet--Debra Messing,  Eric McCormack, Karen Mullally, and Sean Hayes--became more comically  exaggerated as they risked pushing their characters (already riddled with  neuroses and snippiness) into the realm of caricatures. But due to clever  writing and confident, full-throttle performances, it doesn't matter. Even  when Jack and Karen's high-handed behavior go beyond anything recognizably  human, audiences love them all the more; no matter how high-strung Will  and Grace become, their well-honed rapport keeps them engaging and  lovable.Wisely, the writers swiftly returned the pair to roommate status  and got Grace out of her ongoing relationship with Will's former boss  (Gregory Hines), bringing the show's focus back on how the pair sublimate  their love lives with the cozy intimacy of friendship--one particularly  strong episode flashes back to how they first met in college, replete with  godawful 80s fashion. But, as ever, it's Jack and Karen who up the comic  ante; Mullally and Hayes are shamelessly self-absorbed and shallow,  exploiting and abusing everyone around them. Jack forces Will to play  Cyrano, feeding him pick-up lines over his salesperson headset; Karen,  worried that some experimental plastic surgery might turn out badly,  manipulates another socialite into getting it first. Not all plotlines  fly--Grace gets into a relationship with an obnoxious neighbor (Woody  Harrelson) that never becomes more than stunt-casting--but the racy wit  flies fast and furious, the slapstick is topnotch, and Karen's hairdo  towers magnificently.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009WFEEG", "B0001907BW", "B00009Y3RW", "B000G1R3A8", "B000NA78SE", "B000VZADPQ", "B001BNFR6M", "B000EWBKM6", "B000EXDRZI", "B000EBGFQI", "B00005JLEX", "B0001AW066", "B000I2J6VE", "B00005JLIB", "B005Z28M58", "B007C8RZJW", "B003TNW03K", "B003R4ZMSQ", "B000P6YNSO", "B0000844MI", "B0030ATZH6", "B000GPIPTM", "B00008J2EB", "B0000DFZ5O", "B000KGGIL4", "B003TNW03A", "B005UQQRBA", "B0018CWEYO", "B005BUA1GC", "B0002SPNQG", "B0044RFTA6", "B000BXJ1Y2", "B0001NBNJ8", "B0006ZM8M2", "B00000F5W8", "B000P6YNTI", "B0007R4SWC", "B004D2GMVM", "B008L0YMZA", "B00020HAXI", "B007C8RZQ0", "B007C8RZL0", "B000TGJ82G", "B000EBGFPY", "B008LCRA98", "B00382S9T6", "B002JVWR7M", "B000FIMG4U", "B000B5XOVQ", "B0009JQN6M", "B001VFM0ZG", "B00GLT2SOA", "B000T81FHU", "B00IFK7ONI", "B000UX6TL6", "B00BUWD7Y8", "1932273409", "B0002UE1WQ", "B0001O3YLM", "B004A8ZWWO", "B000FVQLIO", "0307931900", "B000C1VBAA", "B001BL6QDW", "B000Q6GUKW", "B00A2XQTVY", "B000FIMG5Y", "B008LCRA7K", "B0009IW88K", "B00005JO9J", "B00I458456", "B0053O89WY", "B00382S9UA", "B00127RAGM", "B0009KQP96", "B000UAE7QI", "B007C8RZYC", "B000TSIJWY", "B0006N2F0E", "B00A2XQU7M", "B000FUTVLO", "B000AJJNJK", "B003Y5HWGI", "B00005PJ6O", "B000RO6JZO", "B007C8RZXS", "B00005KAQJ", "B004STBF2G", "B002OOWKYE", "B003F3NE1Q", "B005MQ58OU", "1558533834", "B000YABIQ6", "B000T988I8", "B000VQYDJM", "B009LDD1X0", "B005IA9JVI", "B0002W4SX6", "B0071HPOHY"], "bought_together": ["B0009WFEEG", "B000G1R3A8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001907BW", "B002YBUX0K", "B0009WFEEG", "B000G1R3A8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14360}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 9.79, "brand": "Lionsgate", "asin": "B0002I84FS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51sL283qBvL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Will &amp; Grace - Season Three"}

{"description": "Hail,Taxi. It's great to finally have one of the defining sitcoms of the 1970s available on DVD to take out for a spin. This character-driven humane comedy from the creators ofThe Mary Tyler Moore Showrolled out of the garage with a full tank of gas: a lightning-in-a-bottle ensemble, smart, witty, and compassionate writing, and extraordinary characters. The Sunshine Cab Company was a much grittier workplace than the sunny WJM newsroom. Its down, but never out employees--single mother Elaine (Marilu Henner), aspiring actor Bobby (Jeff Conaway), hapless boxer Tony (Tony Danza), reptilian dispatcher Louis (Danny DeVito), naive rube John (Randall Carver), and indeterminately foreign mechanic Latka (comic iconoclast Andy Kaufman)--struggled to keep rolling along. Judd Hirsch's salt-of-the-earth cabbie Alex Rieger solved everyone's problems but his own. Half hours don't get more moving than the Humanitas Prize-winning episode, \"Blind Date,\" in which Alex tries to befriend an embittered overweight woman, or funnier than \"High School Reunion,\" in which Bobby impersonates Louie at Louie's reunion to impress his mean former classmates.Along for the ride in this Emmy-winning first season are a pre-MagnumTom Selleck and Mandy Patinkin (\"Memories of Cab 804\") and life force Ruth Gordon, who was honored with an Emmy for her performance as one of Alex's most memorable fares (\"Sugar Mama\"). The poignant episode \"Paper Marriage\" features Christopher Lloyd as burn-out Reverend Jim, who would join the ensemble in season 2. Regrettably, this three-disc set is a stripped down model, with no commentary or interviews. But there is nothing hack aboutTaxiitself. This is \"must-own\" television fare.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006Q93BU", "B000A0GOP0", "B002FLOTFO", "B002PQ7JQU", "B00008EY6N", "B00008NV4G", "B000MGBSH6", "B0006N2EZK", "B000NJMJHA", "B000MXPE6U", "B00005JLIC", "B000YGGNGK", "B002E58FT2", "B001OXLGK0", "B000YKYT1M", "B000FTC1GW", "B0000E32X2", "B00FM4S7P4", "B0000DFZ5O", "B000A0GXGK", "B00361XWEQ", "B000291Q3O", "B001DMVZJ4", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B000QUEQ6I", "B000068V9X", "B002E58FTW", "B0001NBNIY", "B000BOH8YG", "B00096S480", "B000291Q3Y", "B0006N2EZA", "B000A9QKSM", "B000068V9Y", "B0025KVNOU", "B0001Z3I1C", "B0001O3YHQ", "B0000BV1XX", "B00006J6XH", "B00GOC74QG", "B0030U1TCK", "B00361XWF0", "B00HRUQ8YS", "B000EQ46HI", "B0000ZMH92", "B000EHSVC8", "B005ZVIMUE", "B00008EYBH", "B00KYCA4QY", "B001DMVZJO", "B0006IUDYY", "B00009VRF0", "B000BGR1B4", "B000F8O2MO", "B000M343AI", "B001D2WUDE", "B000E1MXWI", "B000K7UBXE", "B002E58FU6", "B00188XHF8", "B00GOC74I4", "B000BOH8YQ", "B0007WFXL2", "B0012EM5EC", "B0002Y4T7O", "B00005JNS8", "B001N26GSE", "B0000CGNEC", "B002E58FUG", "B000Q6GUJS", "B001O4KBN2", "B0019F02W6", "B0002W4SWW", "B001HUHBAY", "B000A0GOQ4", "B000EXDS02", "B00465I1D8", "B0025KVTLW", "B0002I837M", "B002AMVEHY", "B000SQFC0O", "B0050MB5AC", "B00005JLEY", "B00GHH9HW2", "B001E6JC30", "B000MGTQ6G", "B0009UC80Q", "B003PK28FM", "B00005JOXR", "B0025VKX04", "B00005JO3P", "B000CNE0SS", "B0016MJ73M", "B001F7Q4JS", "B002E58FTC", "B0007Y08JW", "B00HNGC56G", "B0000ZMH8S", "B000WQWPSW"], "bought_together": ["B0006Q93BU", "B000A0GOP0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002PQ7JR4", "B0006Q93BU", "B000A0GOP0", "B0000DFZ5O"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 51725}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 15.47, "brand": "HIRSCH,JUDD", "asin": "B0002NY8R6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TwoLoB%2B1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Taxi - The Complete First Season"}
{"description": "If you have even a passing interest in Stevie Ray Vaughan's peerless mastery of urban blues guitar, youmustownLive at Montreux 1982 & 1985. Spaced almost exactly three years apart, these concerts (60 and 93 minutes, respectively) represent the Texan blues god at his fiery best, with Double Trouble (drummer Chris Layton and bassist Tommy Shannon) laying the solid foundation upon which SRV built a Fender-driven sound as fierce as it was perfectly refined. The '82 show was truly \"success in disguise,\" because despite booing from a festival audience lulled by a day of acoustic blues, and the stunned dejection that SRV felt after persevering through a uncompromising set, this was the turning point in SRV's career, leading to post-show encounters with Jackson Browne and David Bowie, who proved instrumental in bringing Stevie's music to an appreciative global audience.When Stevie, Chris, and Tommy returned to Switzerland three years later, with organist Reese Wynans adding rich new dimension to the Double Trouble sound, the Montreux crowd was primed for a rip-snorting set, and SRV's jubilant response is a joyous thing to witness. One of SRV's favorite bluesmen, Johnny Copeland, appears for a three-song triumph in a set that's uniformly superior and ecstatically energized. Basic three-camera coverage is all you need, although guitar students--for whom this DVD is a godsend--will surely wish for more emphasis on SRV's picking and fretwork. Recording quality is superb in the Montreux tradition, with 5.1-channel remixes that surpass the original masters. A splendid 23-minute documentary features retrospective interviews with Layton, Shannon, Browne, and John Mayer, and the accompanying booklet includes a heartfelt reminiscence from Bowie. Stevie Ray may be gone, butLive at Montreuxensures that his gold-standard legacy will endure.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["157330056X", "6305019681", "B000OHZKJA", "B003KUSUE0", "157330087X", "B00377V6J2", "B000BI1YT2", "B0055IU3GI", "B004JR3ONA", "B00IPL286U", "B00005RGPY", "B0054YH7RQ", "B0018M6J72", "B000VI6T6U", "B00AANGHXQ", "0316160695", "B000VR824S", "B00008G90N", "B00428CPUY", "B000VT56XQ", "B0060ANVAU", "B00FLDG52I", "B000PC8AFU", "B003XMKMTQ", "B00CFK5JKY", "B0060ANUWY", "B000051XZF", "B00000ICN9", "B0060ANVE6", "B000BM7U82", "B004FRVE18", "B00008G90M", "B004NCOQVA", "B00752H9V4", "6305610460", "B00006SFLX", "B00FLDG5BE", "B000OPP7LS", "1617740225", "1617130303", "B003MX5OOY", "B002L5GQGY", "B0073SI9E6", "142348598X", "B00006L3J4", "B00008PX8P", "B0054YH7YO", "B000050IKX", "B00005U122", "B00000ICN8", "B0000DJZ81", "B00E0HJDV6", "B003VB5E2E", "0316160687", "B0002KP54E", "B0000E2FLC", "B0012GMWLQ", "B000KHX7AS", "630463949X", "B00000268O", "B00069YDWQ", "B001NP8PQM", "B000002BYA", "B00066VURU", "B00092ZMDY", "B000654YR4", "B000N3SOSY", "B0013K1ALE", "B0024EWOYA", "B00F031WB8", "B00004XMSE", "B0085KGHI6", "B00EL6NWB8", "B0012IWNYU", "B0009E3234", "B004EZIKHM", "B00DNJ99F2", "B00FKIB3XA", "B00008H2I9", "B0080QOK70", "6305076995", "B0060ANKQA", "B007OCD1MQ", "B0009RS088", "1458405494", "B000I5YDAU", "B000UD08HW", "B00BF2RV22", "B0000DZEE3", "0738900370", "B00I5NKPWC", "B00EL6NWT0", "B001DZN602", "B0074JODC6", "B00ILAWJLO", "B0007QS2ES", "B003C1SPX8", "B000IFQLSW", "B0000TB03W", "B0003035CW"], "bought_together": ["6305019681", "157330056X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["6305019681", "157330056X", "B00005RGPY", "B00377V6J2"]}, "price": 13.98, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Blues", "Electric Blues"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Blues", "Modern Blues"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Blues", "Regional Blues", "Texas Blues"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Classic Rock", "Album-Oriented Rock (AOR)"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock", "Blues Rock"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 41034}, "asin": "B0002SPPSC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TZ59APPAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble - Live at Montreux 1982 &amp; 1985"}

{"description": "Reading through all these people bashing these movies has me shaking my head. Really what can you expect out of television movies about Ewoks? To criticize these movies as being too childish is like criticizing the smurfs for being blue. \\r\\nThese movies were made for kids and not the people like me who saw the original STAR WARS movies in the theater as a kid but are now in their 30s.  Really though to be able to get two movies on DVD for about half the price of a tank of gas to me sounds like an okay deal. People really should lighten up and take into account the audience these TV movies were made for.\\r\\nOne bright spot in these movies are some quite ambitious special effects (for TV at least).", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002YCUQ6", "B0002YCUPC", "B000NJMJGG", "B000Y5JFNE", "B0002FEJ0K", "B003OSUGXQ", "B000BCE8Q4", "B0006Z2LMO", "B000FQJAIW", "B000FQJAJG", "B000FQVX78", "B001W72VPW", "B00003CXCT", "B0016BWACI", "B000FAGGWQ", "B004QSQMKE", "1595824340", "1616551747", "B0001I562I", "B00006HBUJ", "0783232047", "B001GZJTIW", "B000LXGY0Q", "B003R3ABL0", "B002VA5A0C", "6301966805", "B000056WR3", "B0089A9VJE", "6305090564", "B0000AUHQC", "B00BTYMPUY", "B005QX8U2Q", "B00003CX5P", "B002I41KNC", "B00004W193", "B00546PXNY", "B00005T5YC", "B001MWUWU8", "B0024FADAQ", "B00JL6L4WC", "B001D7T6EU", "B000A6J6HC", "B000BPL2GK", "B00000JPH6", "B001EN71DQ", "B00E9PMMX0", "B000WQWPKA", "B0016BPWNM", "B00005JLXH", "B003ZSJ212", "B007V4QLXI", "B00000ILFQ", "B0018CWW9G", "B0011367SY", "B00078ZCUS", "B00094ARVO", "B000068QPU", "B002GHHHOM", "B000260NTK", "B001UDPA9M", "B008ETVXQY", "B00595W4CI", "B0064SVO9I", "B004OBQDFM", "B00GJNQ4M0", "0792845773", "B002NZK5SW", "B0000DZ3EN", "B002Z7FM68", "B000AM6ONU", "B002U4UZQI", "B000068MC4", "B009B8YNGO", "B007G8SEF2", "B0002PYS74", "B0002A2VLY", "B0001AW14C", "B0006J28MI", "B00000K3D4", "B0000VCZK2", "B00E9PMML2", "B000PMFRYW", "B004K4FUVQ", "B0000WN0SW", "0783225547", "B00J4BW14O", "B003Q7B7A6", "B00HWWUQYY", "B0000639EX", "B00AGKHBQK", "B006942FGS", "B003UESJLK", "B000RXVNDI", "B002CLBJPK", "B00HERGM86", "B0002JP5EK", "B003DZX44I", "B008K4PGX4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CXCT", "B0002YCUPC", "6301966732", "6301966805"]}, "price": 53.59, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 19250}, "asin": "B0002YCUR0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JSXJMQSBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Wars Ewok Adventures - Caravan of Courage / The Battle for Endor"}
{"description": "The bonus material is comprised of nine 4-6 minutes featurettes on various aspects of the production, giving insight on how the selection of director Paul Greengrass--with his documentary, impromptu methods--led to the film's much-talked-about style. The most interesting are about how they blow up things (without a computer) and a look at the Go Mobile, a new rig to capture a car chase on film. Even though it's not listed on the packaging, there is a commentary track with the director (uninteresting as it is). Something that is listed on the package, \"Explosive Deleted Scenes,\" is really about 7 minutes of ho-hum expository scenes.

{"description": "The connection and interdependence between yoga and belly dance are explored inTribal Fusion, a reasonably comprehensive and intense program drawing on both disciplines and demonstrated by the remarkable Rachel Brice. Practices of three different lengths (15, 30, and about 40 minutes) are offered; elements in the shorter practices are repeated and expanded on in the longer ones. The yoga portions include some basic sun salutations, lunges, backbends (specifically the locust pose), and such; the more extensive belly dancing exercises and undulations focus on the hips, the chest, and shoulders. Brice's instructions are efficient, if sometimes a bit on the brisk side (it's one thing to exhort students to practice ujjayi pranayama, the deep, audible nostril breathing style used in yoga; it's quite another to do so without even saying what it is, let alone showing how it's done). Whether or not any of the female users for which this DVD is intended will be able to replicate Brice's belly dancing moves is open to question, as her technique and amazingly toned body make things look easy when, in fact, mere mortals may find them baffling, to say the least. Moreover, although Carolena Nericcio, one of Brice's mentors and the \"hostess\" of this program, stresses that \"the main attraction (of belly dancing) is delight,\" Brice doesn't seem to be having much fun, never so much as cracking a smile. Little matter.

{"description": "Something the Lord Maderecounts the relationship between Dr. Alfred Blalock (Alan Rickman) and Vivian Thomas (Mos Def). It begins in 1930s Nashville when imperious cardiac surgeon Blalock hires Thomas, an African American carpenter, as his janitor. When the latter reveals a passion for medicine and facility with surgical instruments, Blalock promotes him to lab tech. Thomas isn't given a raise, works side jobs to make ends meet, and is expected to be grateful. Along the way, he follows Blalock from Vanderbilt to Johns Hopkins, where they save thousands of lives through their pioneering work, but will Thomas ever get any credit? The film provides a satisfying answer to that question. Joseph Sargent (A Lesson Before Dying) directs with subtlety and intelligence, while Rickman and Mos Def are in top form, often underplaying where most actors would do otherwise.Something the Lord Madewon the 2004 Emmy for outstanding made-for-TV movie.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Never tell Brother Cadfael, the medieval mystery-solving monk, your theory of how a crime \"must\" have been committed. \"We must always be wary of 'must,'\" he states. \"Nothing is certain.\" And so attest these divine mysteries based on thebooks by Ellis Petersand originally broadcast in the U.S. on the PBS seriesMystery!Each of the 13 feature-length episodes inThe Cadfael Collectionis self-contained but plays against the backdrop of England's civil war between forces loyal to King Stephen and those to Empress Maud. Derek Jacobi (I, Claudius,Gladiator) stars as Cadfael, who at one point is aptly described as \"an odd kind of monk.\" The former \"soldier, sailor, sinner, and Crusader\" has his faith tested by crimes of royal intrigue and baffling murders that seem to plague the neutral ground of 12th-century Shrewsbury. \"The Virgin in the Ice\" is a good introduction forCadfaelinitiates. This story of \"violence and cruelty\" involves the near-fatal beating of a young monk, the murder of a nun, and the disappearance of two children. Local undersheriff Hugh Beringar (played over the course of the series by Sean Pertwee, Eoin McCarthy, and Anthony Green) relies on Cadfael when murder subverts his efforts to keep the peace. A tense standoff between these two friends heightens the climax of \"St. Peter's Fair.\" Americans have never seen a sleuth such as Cadfael, a fascinating character who is at once a man of God, of science, and even of action.

With his new human partner, Togusa, Batou investigates a series of bloody murders involvinggynoids, robots with sexual functions. The case leads them to the headquarters of the Locus Solus company, where Batou uncovers the evil secret behind the creation of thegynoids.Innocenceincludes some staggeringly beautiful CG images, especially a parade depicting characters from Chinese mythology.

{"description": "The DVD release ofMurphy Brownis particularly newsworthy. There had never been anyone on primetime quite like Murphy, the star investigative reporter for the Washington, D.C.-based television news magazineF.Y.I.As created by Diane English and embodied by Candice Bergen, Murphy was, in English's words, \"Mike Wallace in a dress.\" On camera, she was tough, smart, and relentless. Off camera she was intriguingly flawed. In the pilot episode, her character returns to work following a stay at the Betty Ford Clinic. Over the course of the season, her sobriety is supremely tested by the chaotic goings-on inside the funniest newsroom since WJM onThe Mary Tyler Moore Show. Murphy must contend with an unending parade of ill-suited, stressed-out secretaries (a running joke throughout the series' 10 years), new 25-year-old producer Miles Silverberg (Grant Shaud) whom she rudely dismisses (\"While I was being maced at the Democratic Convention in '68, you were wondering if you'd ever meet Adam West\"), and new co-anchor Corky Sherwood (Faith Ford), a former Miss America (\"by default\") with no journalistic background. Murphy is over 40 and prickly, with a penchant for vindictive practical jokes against her colleagues. In short, in the words of a lampooning cartoonist in the episode \"Funnies Girl,\" dynamic, \"pain-in-the-butt,\" Motown-loving Murphy is \"a veritable fountain of material.\"With its smart and sophisticated writing and seamless ensemble,Murphy Browninstantly established itself as one of television's gold standard series, earning four Emmy Awards for this inaugural season, including Outstanding Lead Actress for Bergen and Outstanding Writing for English. Colleen Dewhurst was also honored for her guest appearance as Murphy's equally intimidating mother in the episode, \"Mama Said.\" A cast and crew retrospective and commentaries by Bergen and English for, respectively, the pilot and classic flashback episode \"The Summer of '77\" earn this set R*E*S*P*E*C*T.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001O4KBNM", "B00005JOXR", "B0006N2EZK", "B007GMKX5W", "B00005JLIB", "B0028S110A", "B000YKYT1M", "B000F8O2MO", "B005M5OSBU", "B00005JLIC", "B0030ATZH6", "B002OOWKYE", "B00008J2EB", "B006UKX628", "B0025KVNOU", "B007RMQ4CW", "B000EGDAO8", "B00A2XQTF0", "B000FTC1GW", "B0002NY8R6", "B000MGBSH6", "B000K7VHJ6", "B00GHH9HW2", "B00GOC74I4", "B00GHH9HUE", "B000NTMA1U", "B001LRL4WY", "B00008EY6N", "B000MGBLFK", "B000MXPE6U", "B000TD4N9W", "B0030U1TCK", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B000EHSVBE", "B00GOC74QG", "B000YGGNGK", "B003XL6EHQ", "B000E1MXW8", "B000Z27H8Q", "B000A0GOP0", "B00168OIJY", "B00008EYBH", "B000EOTVAM", "B000A9QKSM", "B00361XWEQ", "B000Q6GUJS", "B000HT3P56", "B00GC2KI2U", "B000E6ES9Y", "B001D2WUDE", "B0007XBMA2", "B00GLPYVQC", "B001P9N9B2", "B006WK4Y8Q", "B00005JNIS", "B0025KVTLW", "B000EXDRZI", "B000A0GOQY", "B00096S480", "B006WK4Y6I", "B0006Q93BU", "B008BLCP0S", "B005ZVIMUE", "B001OXLGK0", "B00009Y3RW", "B00005JNHS", "B000ASDFIG", "B000TZ7FTK", "B002WN8IR0", "B000RGULLA", "B000O77SOK", "B00HRUQA6O", "B000QUEQ6I", "B0025VKX04", "B000GPPNO2", "B00HNGC56G", "B0007Y08RY", "B0027CSMY0", "B000TGURZ8", "B00008NV4G", "B00274SIVA", "B000KX0IPO", "B00000K32N", "B00HW3LG3S", "B00HNGC516", "B0006H32DY", "B00HV0TJM2", "B002PQ7JQU", "B000C6NPHC", "B002FLOTFO", "B003UH3RIC", "B00DXLO086", "B00D2UMHD8", "B000A7Q1YC", "B009I23DAA", "B002E58FT2", "B001D2WUCA", "B007PK8686", "B002PQ7JR4"], "bought_together": ["B001O4KBNM", "B0028S110A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0030ATZH6", "B001O4KBNM", "B0028S110A", "B002OOWKYE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23034}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 11.25, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0006N2EZA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51vc4MO6QQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Murphy Brown: Season 1"}
{"description": "A serial killer dispassionately discusses the nuts and bolts of his grisly avocation, as well as the youthful traumas which helped to mold him into a psychopath, in this disturbing independent drama from Germany, based on a true story. Young Jurgen Bartsch (Sebastian Urzendowsky) was raised in a family where his father (Walter Gontermann) barely acknowledged his existence and his mother (Ulrike Bliefert) displayed an inappropriate degree of affection toward him. When he reached puberty, Bartsch (played as a teenager by Tobias Schenke) was a young man confused and bitter about his growing sexual maturity, and possessing a deep hatred of those around him. Bartsch was a 15-year-old apprentice butcher when he kidnapped and murdered a young boy; he would kill three more boys in a similar fashion before he was captured by police in 1966. After he was found guilty, Bartsch carefully documented his childhood and his crimes in a series of letters and essays, and Ein Leben lang kurze Hosen tragen is drawn from his own words as it dramatizes his life and his crimes. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B009SFR2QI", "B001F114IA", "B000OH1DAK", "6305777837", "B0083TUE7E", "B000FDE5CQ", "B0001ZMXKE", "B000P7V5MA", "B000A59Q5A", "B00657PLN8", "B000QBW7KE", "B004EBT81I", "B0046WCM7M", "B000P6R9NU", "B00IKM5OCO", "B003YMR9IC", "B001AZKB8K", "1590213289", "1424196965", "B0000687FH", "B001EHDMW6", "B000NA21RM", "B00004YKRO", "B000WOYRXK", "B000067J4I", "B00GHP8SH4", "B00366BJAK", "B000QQCWJA", "B0002Y4TE2", "B000089732", "B000063K0V", "B000I5X7Z2", "B000F6II1M", "B000JD6L3S", "B00008UALE", "B008JFX04G", "B002X9S6RK", "B000O76TPY", "B00004YKRN", "B000FFJYDY", "B0009ZE9F8", "1908341696", "B00005QAPW", "B00BC0JIW8", "B009RNK128", "B001JIG5BK", "B0006U0RQ6", "B000RW5CBS", "B000RW5CCM", "B003N2CVQI", "B009VL2A4I", "B004XVMCKI", "B00AWQEK26", "0349113009", "B00005U14H", "B00001QGJ6", "B0000UHG0M", "1413768776", "B004FSXRMQ", "B00782O7LG", "B001P42YC2", "B000OVLMM0", "B000VZC4WQ", "B000EGEKRO", "B00488YCOA", "B000GTLQU8", "B004B3AH8W", "B002394Z6Q", "B0099PW0D2", "B00CVHRCTM", "B00DYA7Y8Y", "B00007G1Z6", "B00006BSC8", "B0001Y4MK4", "B000H1RFEG", "B0000DIJON", "B00CBVWX2O", "B00023P4I8", "B007L6JQ3S", "B002MRVP7G", "B00DUJH8V2", "B00996RSYM", "B00020HAXS", "B005OTQIK8", "B004ODLUIU", "B007R3A30U", "B002HP4LH4", "B004SIP6GI"], "bought_together": ["B0001ZMXKE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005DKS220", "B001P42YC2", "B003YMR9IC", "B000P7V5MA"]}, "price": 22.49, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 93103}, "asin": "B0006Q9428", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51M3NNRYXBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Child I Never Was"}

Jib hurries along the colorful path to the Kingdom, meeting new friends Mr. Mint and Jolly along the way, while the sneaky Licorice Bites steal Princess Lolly's scepter to further Lord Licorice's evil plan to turn Candy Land into Licorice Land.  A chance meeting between Jib and Princess Lolly leads the two to join forces against Lord Licorice, but can they possibly recover the scepter and make it to the Candy Castle in time for the celebration?  Five original songs add musical fun to a fanciful adventure that offers a cute story to accompany a whole new generation's journey to Candy Land. (Ages 3 to 7)--Tami Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006VXMJ4", "B000ISFKNQ", "B000A0GOOQ", "B00CFY1Z08", "B000TXPXCI", "B00AZE1H3U", "B0007V6362", "B0007Q1IV2", "B0001NBNIE", "B002H3EUE0", "B004ZENT78", "B002FOFX6U", "B001LM64TW", "B008R2TEWI", "B00ALTQRLQ", "B003P3PQMQ", "B00G5G7EXY", "B004DS9UF6", "B00000DMF5"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000ISFKNQ", "B00000DMF5", "B0007V6362", "B00CFY1Z08"]}, "price": 12.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 52737}, "asin": "B00078XGOM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515JAY5G1BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Candy Land - The Great Lollipop Adventure"}

{"description": "In addition to inspiring a college drinking game that's never gone out of style,The Bob Newhart Showgave one of America's greatest stand-up comedians a perfect sitcom showcase. This wasn't Newhart's first TV show (following the success of his comedy albums, he hosted a short-lived variety show in 1961-62), but it was the first to transfer his wry, inimitable wit to an effective alter ego, and as mild-mannered psychologist Bob Hartley, 43-year-old Newhart found a sublime character conduit for stone-faced sarcasm that was biting but never malicious.Watch our exclusive interviewwith Bob Newhart:high bandwidthorlow bandwidthLiving in a Chicago high-rise with Emily, his wife of three years and a third-grade schoolteacher (played with underrated smartness by Suzanne Pleshette), 40-year-old Bob divides his time equally between happy (but not too happy) domesticity and time at the office, where he employs a feisty and frequently lovelorn receptionist Carol (Marcia Wallace, who later enjoyed a thriving career providing voices forThe Simpsonsand other animated shows) who also works for Jerry (Peter Bonerz, who became a respected TV director), a bachelor dentist and Bob's best friend.The first season (of six, on CBS until August 1978) offered the same high quality asThe Mary Tyler Moore Show(also produced by Moore's MTM Enterprises) and established many of the memorable characters who contributed to the show's enduring greatness. Bill Daily (late ofI Dream of Jeannie) would thrive as the Hartley's divorced neighbor Howard (his uninvited \"Hi Bob!\" intrusions inspired that infamous drinking game), while married neighbor Margaret (Patricia Smith) would disappear by season's end. Among Bob's hilarious group-therapy patients, the miserable misanthrope Mr. Carlin (Jack Riley) was a comedic goldmine as the series progressed, but it's Newhart's own comic genius--including his perfected phone-call routines and deadpan reactions to everyday dilemmas--that remained the show's greatest asset. These 24 first-season episodes are remarkably consistent under the direction (mostly) of sitcom veterans Jay Sandrich and Alan Rafkin, and guest stars include Penny Marshall, Louise Lasser, Allen Garfield, Chuck McCann, and a host of other '70s TV stalwarts, all meshing nicely with one of TV's funniest ensemble casts. --Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00GHH9HW2", "B00HNGC56G", "B000A9QKSM", "B000E6ES9Y", "B00JHH1VUU", "B000G6BL7O", "B00005JLIC", "B006VC3LDO", "B00HRUQB5O", "B00096S480", "B000Z27H8Q", "B000NTMA1U", "B000G6BLDI", "B000F8O2MO", "B0002NY8R6", "B004ES6TBS", "B00GOC74QG", "B000MXPE6U", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B000BOH8YQ", "B002WN8IR0", "B00IFK7ONI", "B000MGBSH6", "B00KO72X4K", "B003VTKZ84", "B00H8KC1N4", "B00005JOXR", "B000291Q3O", "B0006N2EZA", "B00KYCA4QY", "B00005JOEB", "B0006N2EZK", "B00GOC74I4", "B0006TPE1U", "B000M343AS", "B000BGR1B4", "B000068V9X", "B00008EY6N", "B002PQ7JR4", "B000EXDS02", "B000A0GOP0", "B000FTC1GW", "B00096S45S", "B001OXLGK0", "B000LXGXY8", "B0030U1TCK", "B0002NY8PI", "B000FSMEB0", "B0011N19HI", "B0025KVNOU", "B00009VRF0", "B001Q9E9KG", "B00D2UMHB0", "B0001NBNJ8", "B001NPK5BU", "B000A0GOQ4", "B00E96AWY0", "B00GLT2SOA", "B00IFK7OFG", "B0000V4906", "B003RHZ6CK", "B00005JMHI", "B0000BV1XX", "B00JDCP0QA", "B002E58FT2", "B000N2HD6O", "B00BHWG0N6", "B001JFKWE4", "B000T22PVG", "B005DCJ0Q0", "B000EQ5PTQ", "B000EXZFS0", "B000YGGNGK", "B000E3L7EQ", "B000BF0C8E", "B0007WFY4S", "B0002W4SWW", "B0001DMXEC", "B0085Z6ZD8", "B00HW3LG3S", "B00008EYBH", "B0012EM5E2", "B0012EM5DS", "B000CCBCCG", "B0001Z3I1C", "B00I458456", "B002XKKX8E", "B001O4KBNM", "B0002NY81C", "B00008NV4G", "B0007OCG74", "B0085Z6YYI", "B00A2XQTF0", "B00FM4S7P4", "B0011FLGYM", "B002ACKBTG", "B001D5C1EY", "B00KTFJ7UA", "B0089BSLKS", "B00DICPAMU"], "bought_together": ["B00GHH9HW2", "B00HNGC56G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00GHH9HW2", "B00HNGC56G", "B00HRUQB5O", "B00JHH1VUU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23588}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 17.97, "brand": "NEWHART,BOB", "asin": "B0007IO6PA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JFG6YMC7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Bob Newhart Show - The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "If your sense of humor is even moderately twisted, you'll savorTheatre of Blood, a tasty course of well-cooked ham. Directed with delectable British wit by Douglas Hickox, the comedy is decidedly dark when Vincent Price--as effete has-been thespian Richard Lionheart--wreaks poetic justice upon the snobby critics who panned his performances and drove him to a failed attempt at suicide. Reciting his poor reviews and staging murders inspired by Shakespearean tragedies, the actor and his Dickensian coterie of accomplices (including Diane Rigg, sexy as ever) dispatch their victims with shocking ingenuity, and by the time Lionheart reenactsTitus Andronicusby gorging one dog-loving critic (the hilariously poofy Robert Morley) on toy-poodle stew,Theatre of Bloodreaches giddy heights of outrageous vengeance. It's all in good fun, of course, and the film's esteemed British cast plays it to the hilt, none better than Price in one of his most entertaining roles.--Jeff ShannonMadhousedoesn't skimp on the horror-movie trimmings:  Vincent Price in his campy post-Poe era, a crazy woman kept in the basement, the murder of an ex-porn star, and&#x85; Peter Cushing. All of which turns out to be barely tolerable as drive-in fodder, for this is the least of Price's run of revenge movies in the early Seventies. He plays an actor identified with his horror-movie roles (famed for playing \"Dr. Death\"), who attempts a comeback after a long layoff. Alas, his instability affects the production--or something does, not that you'll likely care about the explanation. Cushing has a collection of Price's old AIP movies to sit around and watch, and Adrienne Corri is the lady in the basement. Ham-handedly directed and confusingly plotted, this one's for diehard Price fans only. And their reward comes at the end, when the actor can be heard crooning \"When Day Is Done\" over the end credits.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00009PY45", "B00009PY4A", "B00009PY4D", "B000068TPF", "B0007R4SZY", "B0007R4T12", "B00ITZXDDY", "B000068TPE", "B00008973G", "B000787YRM", "B004B32532", "B000RO9PUU", "B00CLIAACC", "B007ZFSBWW", "B000068TPG", "B00005KHJP", "B00DOZNI8Y", "B00FM4S68W", "B00AWWX8YG", "B000UDGOBG", "B008FYZHPG", "B000095J42", "B000RXVNDI", "B0000A9GHP", "B00G3DA63Y", "B00005AUK0", "B0000694WH", "B00FGAKEEQ", "B00000K3U3", "B0002DB5PO", "B00D80GMP6", "B0000542CN", "B00D9EJFZA", "B00005K3OD", "B002WJHBE0", "B00GNZM03G", "B000068TPD", "B001BSBBGC", "B00000F62P", "B0001Z37HM", "B0009X770E", "B0009X770O", "B00005R1O7", "B00005K3OG", "B000RXVNCY", "B004LB5FAY", "B009CSVQMC", "B00CKWQNIO", "B000RXVND8", "B00006G8JZ", "B000TUDBGG", "B00FMVV416", "B000A0GOFK", "B000RXVNCE", "B000TGJ89E", "B000FWHW8Q", "B000S0GYBG", "B0000AUHOO", "B00009NHBC", "B000KG4BD6", "B004X63SCY", "B009H3LOX8", "B00009PY41", "B004I3Z6G8", "B000K7VL56", "B000FFJZO2", "B000787YRW", "B008QE9VJI", "B00BPX7K5Y", "B000LPS2UY", "B008FL8OTK", "B000FC2GEQ", "B00B49GSO8", "B006NOC0QO", "B0007R4T08", "B000UDGOAM", "B00005UW7R", "B000096I9U", "B00005KHJQ", "B00009NHAB", "B0002V7SRU", "B0000AGWMC", "B000096I9S", "B00005OSJV", "6305650632", "B0000W5H7Y", "B00B2MLM34", "B000059H87", "B0000W5H74", "B0000W5H88", "B0058CLCNY", "B00008DDIH", "B002PCVLTA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008FYZJ1S", "B0007R4SZY", "B00005K3OD", "B000068TPF"]}, "price": 6.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 116780}, "asin": "B0007R4T2Q", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51241A1BBKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Theater Of Blood/MadHouse (Midnite Movies Double Feature)"}

{"description": "It's hard to believe, but for the first three seasons nobody really knew thatSeinfeldwas about, well, you know. It wasn't until season 4--unleashed here in a four-disc set that's equal in scope, quality, and quantity of bonus material to its predecessors--that the show really became something. In a series which can claim every installment as classic, the two-parter on disc 1 titled \"The Pitch/The Ticket\" truly stands out as a defining episode and, in retrospect, markedSeinfeld4 as the breakthrough season. It's the one where (fake) NBC executives express their interest in working with Jerry Seinfeld on a TV show, then moves to the who's-on-first shtick of George successfully pitching Jerry on creating \"a show about nothing.\" Scattered throughout the discs in commentaries by cast and creators and in numerous \"Inside Look\" documentaries, nearly everyone expresses some anxiety about the season having a story \"arc\" depicting Jerry and his \"real\" life becoming a sitcom. The show had been only marginally successful up to that point anyway, and with the edict, \"no hugging, no learning,\" still in place, maybe messing with nothing was a bad idea. What makes the arc so arch is the self-reflexive way it details the reality of Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David coming up with the concept and pitching it to (real) NBC executives as a show that really was about, well, you know. In one of the many informally informative interview segments, Jerry remembers hitting a stride during this time when a lot of crazy ideas started to make sense. \"Everything was just a wild guess,\" he says, \"and it takes a while to get confident that you're guessing pretty good. I think sometime in season 4 we realized we were guessing pretty good.\" Oh, that we could all be so good at nothing.Season 4 also gave us the episodes \"The Bubble Boy\" (\"He lives in a bubble!\"), \"The Pick\" (\"There was no pick!\"), and, perhaps most memorably, \"The Contest.\" Recalling how nervous he thought NBC might be about a show based on how long a person can remain--ahem--master of his domain, Larry David says that he kept the idea hidden for a long time. He may have had NBC sweating, but the episode goes by without anyone uttering the word that it's really about. The curmudgeonly David also observes that another famous season 4 episode, \"The Outing,\" only made it on the air due to a network \"note\" about making sure it wouldn't be offensive to homosexuals. Hence we have the addition of another standard to theSeinfeldlexicon of American pop culture: \"Not that there's anything wrong with that!\" Not only wasn't there anything wrong with it, the episode won a GLAAD Media Award. Season 4 also broughtSeinfeldits first Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series. Stay tuned for season 5 (and a move to the coveted Thursday-at-9 slot) when the volcano we now know was always brewing really blew its comedic top.--Ted Fry", "related": {"also_bought": ["B008LCRAFC", "B0002UE1WQ", "B008LCRA7K", "B008LCRA98", "B00005JLEX", "B008LCRABQ", "B008LCRAC0", "B0002UE1X0", "B0006IUDYY", "B004D2GMVM", "B000957O8C", "B0001BS3IY", "B000BBOUF4", "B006MFQ4DE", "B000BNTM46", "B000T22PVG", "B000FBH3WC", "B000RBA6CO", "B000002VGR", "B000A0GOQ4", "B0001ZMWXW", "B000TGJ82G", "B00CJ7Y1CK", "B000067DNE", "B000SQFC0O", "B001MVWRNE", "B00070HK4C", "B00000JWVS", "B0058JEI06", "B000BYA4JW", "B007KFZ8B4", "B0002WZTLQ", "B0024FAD9M", "B0058J3S16", "B0019D151K", "B0007R4SWC", "B001B9LWME", "B003YLM79E", "B0007Y08JW", "B000M341S2", "B0007US79Y", "B00BUWD7Y8", "B0001NBNJ8", "B003CJXJ8Q", "B00BXTH474", "B00IFK7ONI", "B002E58FT2", "B00K8HAJN8", "B00067BCB8", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B003L77G9W", "B0001NBNIY", "B00008NV4G", "B009LDD1X0", "B000TZJBPQ", "B000VDDE18", "B000U1ZV76", "B001DMVZKI", "B003YLM78U", "B000B5XOUC", "B000068CNX", "B001GQ3GHG", "630529142X", "B007KFZ8AK", "B000ERVJMW", "B009LDD4BO", "B0053O89WY", "B005D0OHA6", "B002ZG971U", "B001AEF6AY", "B007KFZ8AA", "B0020TS5EM", "B007KFZ7Q0", "B008G33PIM", "B000BYCAJE", "B00DJYJRHG", "0310335280", "B003TFAJ18", "B0052C5EHK", "B003UD7JAI", "B00BT1XCOU", "B000BGR1B4", "B0000027RL", "B0089BSNVK", "B003R0MEZ4", "B0045HCJRG"], "bought_together": ["B008LCRAFC", "B008LCRA7K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002UE1WQ", "B008LCRAFC", "B008LCRA98", "B00EIJTLK4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 4086}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 11.98, "brand": "Columbia Tri Star", "asin": "B0007YXRCW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512590Q1ZAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Seinfeld: Season 4"}

{"description": "Hideo Nakata follows up on the phenomenal success of Ringu -- the highest grossing Japanese film up to that point -- with this effort. In the previous film, Reiko (Nanako Matsushima) was a television reporter doing a piece on a videotape that seemed to kill those who watched it. Not long after learning that the cause of the killing was a vengeful spirit named Sadako who inhabited the video, Reiko's researcher ex-husband (Hiroyuki Sanada) died a painful death, and the fate of Reiko's son, Yoichi (Rikiya Otaka) -- who watched the tape -- was in doubt. Ring 2 opens with an autopsy of Sadako, whose supernatural rage was sparked when she was dumped in a well. Sadako's powers affect Yoichi, who survived the video and has become a medium of sorts for the wraith. Also affected is Reiko's dead husband's mistress, Mai Takano (played by pop star Miki Nakatani), whose life has become a living nightmare. Also under Sadako's power is Masami Kurahashi (Hitomi Sato), who was a schoolmate of one of Sadako's first victims. Though many try to get to the bottom of the problem -- including a psychologist (Fumiyo Kohinata) and a police detective (Kenjiro Ishimaru) -- the bodies start piling up. ~ Jonathan Crow, Rovi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000088NQR", "B000RZIGTU", "B000H0M4CK", "B00005JNJR", "B00E1HIXD4", "B00DW5IM14", "B000F67IA4", "B000E0OE4O", "B0009KA2UO", "B0009X763M", "B00IQAUO2A", "B0000AVHAO", "B000LPS3B2", "159582071X", "B003UTPL2A", "B0006SGYL0", "B00AEFYYH6", "B004O63TWW", "B001P3SA9Y", "B0009WFEDC", "B000GB5MOW", "B0002ZDW7Q", "B0000UX5YI", "B000C8STDK", "B00136MBUW", "B0009YA3YA", "B0007CNY2W", "B000MM0LHS", "B0009A40PC", "B000EHQ7ZQ", "B000FZEQVY", "B000O76TOU", "B00125WAW8", "B000BC8T3C"], "bought_together": ["B000088NQR", "B00005JNJR"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DW5IM14", "B00DW5IK3Y", "B0006SGYL0", "B000H0M4CK"]}, "price": 3.06, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 295285}, "asin": "B0009X765A", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K20JSYRSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ringu 2"}

{"description": "Movie studios, by and large, avoid controversial subjects like race the way you might avoid a hive of angry bees. So it's remarkable thatCrasheven got made; that it's a rich, intelligent, and moving exploration of the interlocking lives of a dozen Los Angeles residents--black, white, latino, Asian, and Persian--is downright amazing. A politically nervous district attorney (Brendan Fraser) and his high-strung wife (Sandra Bullock, biting into a welcome change of pace fromMiss Congeniality) get car-jacked by an oddly sociological pair of young black men (Larenz Tate and Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges); a rich black T.V. director (Terrence Howard) and his wife (Thandie Newton) get pulled over by a white racist cop (Matt Dillon) and his reluctant partner (Ryan Phillipe); a detective (Don Cheadle) and his Latina partner and lover (Jennifer Esposito) investigate a white cop who shot a black cop--these are only three of the interlocking stories that reach up and down class lines. Writer/director Paul Haggis (who wrote the screenplay forMillion Dollar Baby) spins every character in unpredictable directions, refusing to let anyone sink into a stereotype. The cast--ranging from the famous names above to lesser-known but just as capable actors like Michael Pena (Buffalo Soldiers) and Loretta Devine (Woman Thou Art Loosed)--meets the strong script head-on, delivering galvanizing performances in short vignettes, brief glimpses that build with gut-wrenching force. This sort of multi-character mosaic is hard to pull off; Crash rivals such classics asNashvilleandShort Cuts.

{"description": "Here are 18 more eye-popping episodes from HBO's shiver-shudder-and-shriek anthology series, adapted from the pages of E.C. Comics' legendary horror comics. Season 2 ofTales from the Cryptdoesn't back down from the promise made by its debut season: some of the biggest names in Hollywood do their best in front of and behind the camera to deliver the gory goods, with a healthy dash ofTales' signature coal-black humor. There's Demi Moore as a classic E.C. femme fatale in Howard Deutch's \"Dead Right\";Desperate Housewives' Teri Hatcher co-stars with a reanimated corpse in \"The Thing from the Grave\"; Iggy Pop and the voice of Sam Kinison are featured in a sinister story of music and murder in \"For Cryin' Out Loud\"; and Arnold Schwarzenegger makes his directorial debut with the macabre \"The Switch.\" Series co-producers Walter Hill and Richard Donner also contribute creepfests, as do horror vets Jack Sholder, Tom Holland, and special effects designer Chris Walas; other performers facing fearsome fates include Patricia Arquette, Don Rickles, Bobcat Goldthwait, Lance Henriksen, and Harry Anderson. The three-disc set definitely delivers a triple treat of terror, but unfortunately, the supplemental features are a little (ahem) anemic, especially in comparison to the solid extras in thefirst-season set.

{"description": "When it premiered on CBS on October 2, 1955,Alfred Hitchcock Presentswas an instant hit destined for long-term popularity. The series' original half-hour anthology format provided a perfect showcase for stories of mystery, suspense, and the macabre that reflected Hitchcock's established persona. Every Sunday at 9:30 p.m., the series began with the familiar theme of Gounod's \"Funeral March of a Marionette\" (which would thereafter be inextricably linked with Hitchcock), and as Hitchcock's trademark profile sketch was overshadowed by the familiar silhouette of Hitchcock himself, the weekly \"play\" opened and closed with the series' most popular feature: As a good-natured host whose inimitable presence made him a global celebrity, Hitchcock delivered droll, dryly sardonic introductions and epilogues to each week's episode, flawlessly written by James Allardyce and frequently taking polite pot-shots at CBS sponsors, or skirting around broadcast standards (which demanded that no crime could go unpunished) by humorously explaining how the show's killers and criminals were always brought to justice... though always with a nod and a wink to the viewer.This knowing complicity was Hitchcock's pact with his audience, and the secret to his (and the series') long-term success. It's also what attracted a stable of talented writers whose teleplays, both original and adapted, maintained a high standard of excellence. Hitchcock directed four of the first season's 39 episodes, including the premiere episode \"Revenge\" (a fan favorite, with futurePsychocostar Vera Miles) and the season highlight \"Breakdown,\" with Joseph Cotten as a car-accident victim, paralyzed and motionless, who's nearly left for dead; it's a perfect example of visual and narrative economy, executed with a master's touch. (The fourth episode, \"Don't Come Back Alive,\" is also a popular favorite, with the kind of sinister twist that became a series trademark.) Robert Stevenson directed the majority of the remaining episodes with similar skill, serving tightly plotted tales (selected by associate producers Joan Harrison and Norman Lloyd) by such literary greats as Ray Bradbury, Robert Bloch, Cornell Woolrich, Dorothy L. Sayers, and John Collier. Adding to the series' prestige was a weekly roster of new and seasoned stars, with first-season appearances by Cloris Leachman, Darren McGavin, Everett Sloane, Peter Lawford, Charles Bronson, Barry Fitzgerald, John Cassavetes, Joanne Woodward, Thelma Ritter, and a host of Hollywood's best-known character players. With such stellar talent on weekly display,Alfred Hitchcock Presentspaved the way forThriller,The Twilight Zone, and other series that maximized the anthology format's storytelling potential.Packed onto three double-sided DVDs, these 39 episodes hold up remarkably well, and while some prints show the wear and tear of syndication, they look and sound surprisingly good (although audio compression will cause many viewers to turn up the volume). The 15-minute bonus featurette, \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents: A Look Back\" is perfunctory at best, but it's nice to see new anecdotal interviews with Norman Lloyd, assistant director Hilton Green, and Hitchcock's daughter Pat (a frequent performer on these episodes), who survived to see their popular series benefit from the archival convenience of DVD.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000HDR814", "B000TXPXD2", "B002NPY7GS", "B005UL4NF2", "B00FEOYY8G", "B003NOGNQU", "B0002CX1M0", "B00BI3XZA0", "B0007CEXUY", "B001DXS4DI", "B002GSXKQA", "B000UVV25Q", "B000H5U5EE", "B006TBYC76", "B00KTZALDC", "B000A9QK7I", "B001HNDR4A", "B003VJTGNE", "B00BQK4YDC", "B005EVY8MQ", "B0002HOEPS", "B000A1INJE", "B0002NRRRE", "B00C6F61S2", "B000TJBNF8", "B00EEEHLKU", "B00JKTFQJM", "B000BC8T1E", "B001D8W7F4", "B00009VRF0", "B00IU6HQ4O", "B000MGBSDK", "B00CPTUN8S", "B00KBES386", "B007I8KXQ8", "B004CQZFL2", "B00JEZWRE4", "B0002J4ZX2", "B002DMJM7K", "B00016XN48", "B00068NVLQ", "B008OIQYXM", "B009OE2O0C", "B000F48D0U", "B00KE3B9US", "B00005JO3P", "B005D7E7Y0", "B00308B170", "B0030BS1E8", "B004IB04S0", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B0016MOWNM", "B00F6D62O4", "B009OE2NZI", "B00005JN8Q", "B000BQ5IXW", "B0008ENID4", "B001D8W7EK", "B00DZP1C18", "B0012KSUUO", "B00AQMGQVY", "B009OE2ODY", "B00BDZV4OW", "B00005JLIC", "B00E5G03I4", "B000QTCY7M", "B0044A5BPQ", "B005NHZAXM", "B008I34Y3K", "B001992NXI", "B001CQONOA", "B000IHYXJO", "B0002COTDA", "B00096S480", "B002ACKBU0", "B000LE16VC", "B005BUA1F8", "B000BF0C7A", "B009OE2NS0", "B008DCAG9M", "B005LVIP1E", "B001BN4WHW", "B000BGR1B4", "B009GGWW3W", "B00ARA4SLU", "B00BAXTYI0", "B000PHX5KU", "B001SLNPSO", "B001JAHPMG", "B000OPOAKW", "B00000JNUZ", "B001E6HUWK", "B00G5N6C8U", "B00000C0QO", "B00009Y3RE", "B000LXGXY8", "B008MIYKS0", "B000MGBSQM", "B000ECX0O2", "B00GSMZ3I8"], "bought_together": ["B000HDR814", "B000TXPXD2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005UL4NF2", "B000TXPXD2", "B002NPY7GS", "B00FEOYY8G"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30917}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 21.25, "brand": "HITCHCOCK,ALFRED", "asin": "B000AL733G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41nEauPqQpL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Alfred Hitchcock Presents - Season One"}

{"description": "The question facing any viewer of the Japanese CG featureFinal Fantasy VII: Advent Childrenis: do you have to know the games on which it&#x92;s based in order to understand the film? And the answer is: it certainly helps. But even complete novices (i.e., most parents) in theFinal Fantasyworld will find some entertainment in its wealth of fantasy-based action, and the animation never fails to astonish. Picking up two years after an epic battle between the forces of good (represented by brooding soldier Cloud) and evil (Cloud&#x92;s former general, Sephiroth),FFVIIopens in the devastated city of Midgard, whose youthful occupants suffer from a ghastly disease known as Geostigma. A trio of brothers arrives with what appears to be a cure for the plague, but their gesture conceals a more sinister purpose: to revive Sephiroth and bring about the end of the world. Cloud and his companions must once again rise to the occasion to stop the siblings and the revived Sephiroth from unleashing total destruction. Complex and self-referential to the point of occasional incomprehension,Final Fantasy VIIwill definitely be most appreciated by fans of the game series, but if others can look past the numbing dialogue and frenetic action (which is a bit too intense for very young children), the film offers a carefree and action-packed viewing experience. The two-disc set contains the original Japanese language version of the film as well as an English-dubbed edition (Rachel Leigh Cook and Christy Carlson Romano, among others, provide the vocal talent) and a version edited for the Venice Film Festival. A 30-minute featurette that recaps theFinal Fantasystory up toVII, as well as a making-of documentary, deleted scenes, and promotions for futureFinal Fantasy VIIgames and products round out the extras.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CY5D", "B000FDOTIQ", "B0007OY31G", "B00000JRSB", "B0014X7SQ6", "B008H6GHL0", "B001I9XOQO", "B0010358CQ", "B000QXDFQM", "B00005V1XW", "B00005TNI6", "B001TD6SN0", "B000XYBIKO", "B009AVC922", "B000LOAQNQ", "B001JTADR6", "074401543X", "1566867142", "B0000296O5", "B00ENNBZ68", "B00008URUA", "B001CMIUYS", "B002I0GXWO", "B008H6GH8I", "0744010241", "B00005LOXE", "0804162867", "B003IFVKM6", "6304493681", "B000KF0P1Y", "B000FQ2DTA", "B00002R28C", "B000FS2VZO", "B00008RUYZ", "B004JPJHMY", "B002U6CJO2", "B0009A4EVM", "B000AO8CH4", "B0012Z5UM0", "B0047WMHGC", "B0001O3YA8", "B00003CXBK", "B005H0OEJ6", "B000GABOTU", "B004DMIISM", "162692032X", "B00005NG6U", "B00AO075UY", "B000Y53HH4", "B005NQ5LLE", "B00EZ227X2", "B001GXI4LM", "B002I0GZ5Y", "B004L6Y0T6", "B001G3B0HC", "B00005V4XG", "B00KN16YHO", "B001OQCVI8", "0767802454", "B002MIK0TE", "B000R37S00", "B00BY0G0YU", "B00009WAUH", "0307468372", "B005I65NBW", "B00GHJX8W0", "B008SBZD5U", "B000F6ZIFQ", "0316401196", "B001C4ZQEI", "B000CDGVOO", "B002FVPFUC", "B00004TC6E", "B004COLCK2", "B00005JNJV", "B000NDRNMM", "B00GOT13BQ", "B00004Y57G", "B0045U4U52", "B001TD6SK8", "B0002A2S26", "B002S4DOA4", "B0036BDQ88", "B0013FID78", "B007NU542O", "B000NPTOTK", "B0071LEH14", "1421500493", "B0010YOQIW", "B002O3Z50Q", "B003F3NEAC", "B00829H3E2", "B000BKSJ52", "B00356GVRW", "0744000416", "B000CDGVOE"], "bought_together": ["B00003CY5D", "B0007OY31G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00C3MKCF6", "B0029XFQF0", "B004LWZW4M", "B004DMIIVO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 25738}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.64, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000AMJG4Y", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J3SJW6H0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Final Fantasy VII - Advent Children (Two-Disc Special Edition)"}

{"description": "Home to some of the world's best food and fashion, the French also have the wonderful habit of producing some of the world's best movies. WithHigh Tension, French director Alexandre Aja offers up a bloody buffet of terror; a violent concoction of style over substance, with a bloody French twist.       Two college girlfriends, Maria and Alex, take a weekend to study at the secluded country home of Alex's parents.   Shortly after their arrival, a mysterious killer appears, and things take a shockingly terrible turn for the worse. As the horror and body count rises, Maria and Alex find themselves fighting for their lives, and it's revealed that things are not exactly as they seem.     Essentially a one-act cat-and-mouse affair,High Tensionis an explosive bloody thrill ride that rarely lets up.   Oozing style in every color-saturated frame and boasting some intense performances, Aja mainly succeeds in sustaining an intense momentum throughout the film.  The plot occasionally suffers from a thin, flimsy storyline, and the abundant graphic scenes of violence will either thrill and delight, or simply disgust.   Nonetheless, this adrenalin-fueled addition to the genre gives the American slasher flick a real run for its money.High Tensionis high-art horror, and comes highly recommended.--Matt Wold", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001MEJY8W", "B0014VPFVS", "B00125WATQ", "B000EOTVU2", "B000GI3KGC", "B0009WFEDC", "B002EOVXBK", "B00GGY4R3K", "B001G9CNI6", "B00005K9O8", "B000WC38EQ", "B00009W0U4", "B000X1RYEQ", "B0041KKYCY", "B004AC6PV2", "B000EHRVP6", "B0028DRGDQ", "B000N3AW6G", "B005SQRYB4", "B001MFNB4O", "B000GSYRY6", "B000IHY9TS", "B000S0GYRU", "B00009MEC4", "B00187FPC2", "B001D2WU9I", "B0000CABGW", "B001B187L6", "B00G5GNYY2", "B008G1JIQC", "B001JV5BIA", "B002LMSWN2", "B000WC389G", "B0082A3HFK", "B002OVO18A", "B004P2VQZ2", "B00699G622", "B0009OUBC4", "B008JFUNYG", "B000FS9FE4", "B004EI2NP4", "B0013D8L7M", "B008NNY8XQ", "B000GI3RHY", "B00J81S92S", "B001D5C1OO", "B0031U8OEK", "B00196UTEG", "B006QWC2ZC", "B008WAM2E2", "B0015ET3YO", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000MM0LIM", "B00BSU0FQA", "B008BM5WQG", "B00AJLHUA8", "B000GLL1U6", "B003Q6D246", "B0083H6B0U", "B00006FDBW", "B001MVYUR0", "B000IMUYJM", "B00DMUFXOS", "B0021L8UPS", "B000099T3M", "B00CU00JTU", "B003L20IEC", "B0051CSIKQ", "B000NVT0TI", "B00DPUB5EW", "B001D5C1R6", "B00C7C00JU", "B000VKL6Z2", "B006U49SC6", "B0052DP1RC", "B00AZTUUQK", "B002DKGWSE", "B000FZEQWI", "B000RW5BZ0", "B0001611DI", "B0057O6IMS", "B00111YM5Q", "B00177YA6U", "B000UW8596", "B005ER6STG", "B0007WQHI0", "B00079HZY8", "B0009S2T0M", "B00005Q4CS", "B000PKG8TW", "B00006AUIG", "B000AXWHSA", "B001RTKKQW", "B003KGBISE", "B008G33PIM", "B004KDYR20", "6305228876", "B000PMLJMQ", "B002YICNE2", "B0060AAMEI"], "bought_together": ["B001MEJY8W", "B0014VPFVS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001MEJY8W", "B0014VPFVS", "B00GGY4R3K", "B000GI3KGC"]}, "price": 8.37, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23934}, "asin": "B000ARFPMQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K3uQHsEXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "High Tension (Unrated Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "A decade after their last hilarious short, the Oscar-winning A Close Shave, Claymation wonders Wallace and Gromit return for a full-length adventure. Daffy scientist Wallace (voiced by Peter Sallis) and his heroic dog Gromit are doing well with their business, Anti-Pesto, a varmint-hunting outfit designed to keep their English town safe from rabbits chomping on prized vegetables. Wallace meets Lady Tottington (Helena Bonham Carter), who appreciates Wallace's humane way of dealing with rabbits (courtesy of the Bun-Vac 6000), and sets up a rivalry with the gun-toting Victor Quartermaine (Ralph Fiennes, enjoying himself more than ever). Creator Nick Park, with co-director/writer Steve Box, delivers a story worthy of the 85-minute running time, although it stretches the act a bit; the formula plays better shorter, but the literally hand-crafted film is a joy to watch. Taking a chapter from classic horror films, a giant were-rabbit is soon on the prowl, and the town is up in arms, what with the annual vegetable contest close at hand. (Anyone who's seen the previous three shorts knows who saves the day.) Never content to do something simply when the extravagant will do, W&G;'s lives are filled with whimsical Rude Goldberg-style devices, and the opening number showcasing their alarm system is pure Aardman Animation at its finest. Even though there's a new twist here--a few mild sight gags aimed at adults--this G-rated film will delight young and old alike as Park, like team Pixar, seems incapable of making anything but an outstanding film. --Doug Thomas, Amazon.com", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B000CZ0PT4", "B002DPVI0Q", "B00003CXJ4", "B000RMJ4F8", "B000CZ0PW6", "B006W4KVI4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000CZ0PT4", "B0044RFTBA", "B001LXIDTK", "B002DPVI0Q"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 486418}, "asin": "B000B83YWM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51a1pwP5qoL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wallace &amp; Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"}
{"description": "Perennially one of the WB's highest-rated series,Gilmore Girlshit its creative high point to date with its stellar fifth season, which started out with young Rory (Alexis Bledel) feeling the fallout of doing something terribly non-Rory-like: sleeping with Dean (Jared Padalecki), her married ex-boyfriend. Rory's indulgence in adultery put, for the first time, a serious, sharp wedge in her relationship with her mother, Lorelai (Lauren Graham), who was both shocked by her daughter's behavior and worried Rory would repeat the mistakes Lorelai made at her age. But while Rory jetted off to Europe with her grandmother (Kelly Bishop) for the summer, Lorelai finally got her relationship with diner owner Luke (Scott Patterson) into a serious groove, starting with an official (and incredibly sweet) first date and others that involved, if you can believe it, a SwedishPippi Longstockingmovie. And as Lorelai navigated romantic terrain in Stars Hollow (terrain that of course did not run smooth), Rory found life more complex in her second year at Yale, as her relationship with Dean became increasingly strained. Not only that, she found her attention turned towards preppy Logan (Matt Czurchy), a spoiled rich kid who represented everything Rory couldn't stand--and was of course immediately attracted to. Little did Rory know that Logan's entrance into her life, and her interaction with his family, would be the catalyst for one of the most momentous decisions she would ever make.With this season ofGilmore Girls, creative forces Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino finally found a way to make the Stars Hollow-Yale dichotomy work perfectly, as each location still stood alone but had decided repercussions on the other. Gone were freshman-year anxieties for Rory and in their place were more adult romantic concerns as well as a class consciousness that, for the first serious time, found Rory on the side of the haves and not the have-nots. While the Rory-Dean drama played itself out nicely and succinctly, it was the devilish Logan who lit a fire underneath this Gilmore girl; the episode \"You Jump, I Jump, Jack\" was a lovely twist on the '30s romantic comedies that found rich folk at play with words and deeds. Bledel started to fully blossom as Rory grew from ing&#xE9;nue to leading lady, and she was matched peerlessly by Graham, whose passion, anger, stubbornness, and ravishing beauty all came to a head in \"Wedding Bell Blues,\" which featured her two greatest nemeses: her mother and Rory's dad, Christopher (David Sutcliffe). The show's trademark eccentricities were all in place--including aPulp Fictionparty and an elementary school production ofFiddler on the Roof, among other things--but it mined the best drama of its run with the season's last four episodes, which found Rory's confidence shaken to the core.

{"description": "From the premiere of its first hour-long episode on September 13, 1974,The Rockford Fileswas a critical and commercial success that gained a large and loyal following. Like other private-eye shows of the 1970s (such asColumboand David Janssen'sHarry O), the series offered smart mystery plots in the hardboiled-sleuth traditions of Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, and Rex Stout, given a sunlit spin in contemporary California. But ex-convict turned private investigator Jim Rockford (who served time for a crime he didn't commit) was anything but a conventional gumshoe; for one thing, he rarely carried a gun, and resorted to violence only when he'd exhausted his options. As played to perfection by James Garner (in what would become his signature role, surpassing his previous success asMaverick), Rockford preferred wisecracks over violence, and his going rate (\"$200 a day, plus expenses\") was typically applied to cold cases, missing persons, and family disputes, frequently leading to entanglements with organized crime and L.A.P.D. Sergeant Dennis Becker (Joe Santos), whose friendship with Rockford lent the series one of its pivotal character relationships. As Rockford pursued the truth from his rusty trailer-home on the Pacific Coast Highway, his inherent warmth and compassionate sleuthing were further enhanced by engaging interplay with his retired ex-trucker father \"Rocky\" (Noah Beery, Jr.), his lawyer and on-and-off girlfriend Beth Davenport (Gretchen Corbett), and his weasely former cell-mate \"Angel\" Martin (Stuart Margolin), a trio of supporting players as memorably appealing as any in '70s television. As a loose-knit ensemble, they followed Garner's capable lead with intelligent dialogue (the best of it written by series cocreator Stephen J. Cannell and frequent contributor Juanita Bartlett) and occasionally burst of stunt-laden action, typically involving Rockford's expert driving of a versatile Pontiac Firebird. (As Garner fondly recalls in the disc 1 bonus interview, \"That car could do anything.\")With a catchy Mike Post theme song,The Rockford Filesbegan each week with a new message on Rockford's telephone answering machine, usually a humorous indication that Rockford's life was always in some kind of financial disarray. Garner played this angle to the hilt, portraying Rockford as a nice guy who knew all the scams and wasn't above using them if it aided his case. His portrayal, and the show's excellent writing, attracted a wide variety of new and established guest stars, and these 23 episodes (24 if you count the two-part \"This Case Is Closed,\" originally broadcast as one 90-minute episode) feature appearances by Joseph Cotten, James Woods, Sharon Gless, Lindsay Wagner, James Cromwell, Suzanne Somers, Ned Beatty, and others, along with lesser-known but familiar TV regulars like Sian Barbara Allen and Mills Watson, all adding flavor to a series that was routinely hailed by mystery writers as one of the best private-eye shows in TV history. Speaking of mysteries, one can only wonder why Universal failed to include the series' 90-minute pilot (originally aired in March 1974), and while this reviewer experienced no playback problems with these three double-sided DVDs (four episodes per side), many consumers have reported DVD freeze-ups likely resulting from lower-quality players less capable of handling high-compression DVDs. These caveats aside, season 1 ofThe Rockford Filesis a bona fide treat, setting the tone for even better episodes that followed in subsequent seasons.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BF0C8E", "B000LXGXY8", "B000N2HD6O", "B000XJD3K2", "B001JFKWE4", "B002LFQIL2", "B007AAF3FK", "B00B00HUC0", "B00005JMHI", "B00005JO3P", "145164261X", "B0013D8M4E", "B00JZYJ7F6", "B00DDT0JB0", "B004ZRFQCG", "B00ELMZ60M", "B00DYQ1G78", "B00FNRA0KA", "B0003JAOCC", "B002GHHHP6", "B00005JN9P", "B001DDBD4K", "B00007GZR1", "B00005JNHT", "B0007LXP86", "B00IMRL4BC", "0792838408", "B000ASDFIG", "B000BUE5DC", "B000JJSJPK", "B00507O3II", "B00008G7QH", "B00CMB8DP4", "B00006SFKE", "B00KLEYXZS", "B0007TKNGU", "B007XTDWKQ", "B008RJ6TTC", "B000LE16VC", "B00005JNHS", "B004CTG6TO", "B000GW8UAE", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B00936A1ZG", "B00ALTQRNO", "B0029B31HM", "B000HWZ4HU", "B00AMU8K8C", "B0007CNY4K", "B000BUE5CI", "B00CLH0848", "B00018D3RI", "B0002COTDA", "B00368PSKK", "0790731460", "B002XDR5NM", "B00H3L86F0", "B000056H2F", "B000EQ46H8", "B000YKYT1M", "B0029778T8", "B004DSCPRQ", "B001J0FVYK", "B000N6UF10", "B000QUU7KC", "B005TFVM0I", "B0007KIFK0", "B00KTZALDC", "B000FFJYCU", "B000F7CMPE", "B00GOC74QG", "B00005AUKC", "B00LT1JHLW", "B003AWRMBA", "B00JHH1VUU", "B00E3QJ7ZG", "B000YENUOK", "B000MGBSIK", "B004SEUJOQ", "B00BMJ7ZKG", "B004EXWGHY", "039916930X", "B00DXLO0D6", "B00DXLO086", "B004EPYZV2", "B00BMKGZVA", "B00BN3DZZA", "B00DYQ1GBE", "B00KTFJ6J2", "B00DJYJRHG", "B00JEZWRE4", "630560097X", "B00ITAQ2T6", "B00HGE90Z4", "B00915G6MG", "B00K6D1S7A", "B000683VI4", "B00GTZWXYQ", "B00FEP9MYG", "B009EAAL60"], "bought_together": ["B000BF0C8E", "B000LXGXY8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000N2HD6O", "B000XJD3K2", "B002LFQIL2", "B007AAF3FK"]}, "price": 12.49, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 258}, "asin": "B000BGR1B4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K9RTBGV8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Rockford Files - Season One"}

Ariton (Mitko Apostolovski), the camp's headmaster, is a strong taskmaster, but he displays a genuine compassion for his charges; Olivera (Verica Nedeska), his second in command, takes a more stern approach, and is willing to dole out physical punishment to any child who does not absorb her Stalinist teachings. One day, a new boy enters the camp, Isak (Maja Stankovska), who displays a calm but resilient nature that's different from the fearful attitudes of the other children. After initial resistance, Lem becomes close friends with Isak, and their friendship helps Lem confront the horrors of camp life in a new way.", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 202790}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "The Great Water", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EGDMOG", "B00005RRJH", "B0000687FH", "B009SFR2QI", "B0001Y4MK4", "B00DL46ZN8", "B002X9S6RK", "B005LAIHPE", "B00008ZZ9N", "B00195FU82", "B00006LPHE", "B00020HAXS", "B003N2CVQI", "B0000UHG0M", "B00004YKRO", "B000MR9C46", "6305777837", "B00004YKRN", "B001JIG5BK", "B001F114IA", "1424196965", "B00006BSC8", "B00008YJDE", "B000EZ9066", "B000QQCWJA", "B000FFJYL6", "B001BMN35K", "0349113009", "B0009NCQDM", "B000BKVR9W", "B0002Y4TE2", "B00004TJRE", "B000EOU4OY", "B00008YLUN", "1572522739", "B000053V5O", "B0016AKSO6", "B00180R04K", "B000NA21RM", "B000P7V5MA", "B000A7DW8A", "B0006U0RQ6", "B000WOYRZS", "B0006Q9428", "B000BGPH4C", "B000QGES92", "B000I40W4C", "B000QBW7KE", "1908341696", "B000A59Q5A", "B000I2JDDU", "B000RW5CCM", "1590213289", "B00124SNIY", "B00007G1Z6", "B000P6R9NU", "B000E1A4SS", "B000JD6L3S", "B004B3AHC8", "B001P42YC2", "B005J47Q90"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XRS9QN8RL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "B000BJS4DU"}
{"description": "The teaming of Johnny Knoxville (Jackass: The Movie) and Seann William Scott (Dude, Where's My Car?) as well as the presence of the '70s-flavored car chases that were a specialty of the TV series guarantees thatThe Dukes of Hazzardwill be even more lowbrow than the CBS TV series (1979-85) that inspired it. However, this brain-damaging comedy is more \"rehash\" than \"remake,\" as good ol' Georgia boys Luke Duke (Knoxville) and his cousin Bo (Scott) are frequently upstaged by the General Lee, the Confederate-flagged '69 Charger that they drive, jump, race, and fly in as they smuggle moonshine for their Uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson). Meanwhile, cousin Daisy Duke (Jessica Simpson) is reliably available to model her short-shorts (aka \"Daisy Dukes\") and awesome figure (and let's face it, Simpson's talents pretty much begin and end right there), while corrupt honcho Boss Hogg (Burt Reynolds, who should know better) recruits a local NASCAR star to advance his wily scheme of converting Hazzard County into a strip mine. Director Jay Chandrasekhar (Super Troopers) manages to mine some good-natured humor from the movie's oval-track detour and a few colorful supporting players (notably Kevin Hefferman as the Duke's pal Sheev). Otherwise, consider yourself warned:The Dukes of Hazzardis shameless Hollywood product at its most forgettable, trafficking in shameless white, rural Southern stereotypes.

{"description": "With Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson as a pair of brazen wedding crashers, this buddy/romantic comedy milks a few big laughs from its foolproof premise. Under the direction of David Dobkin (who previously worked with Wilson onShanghai Knights), the movie ranges from bawdy romp to mushy romance, and that tonal identity crisis curtails the overall hilarity. But when the well-teamed costars are firing on all pistons with fast-paced dialogue and manic situations, belly laughs are delivered at a steady clip. Things get complicated when the guys infiltrate the family of the Treasury Secretary (Christopher Walken), resulting in a romantic pair-off between Vaughn and the congressman's oversexed daughter Gloria (Isla Fisher) while Wilson sincerely woos another daughter, Claire (Rachel McAdams), who's unhappily engaged to an Ivy League cheater (Bradley Cooper). Walken is more or less wasted in his role, but Jane Seymour and Henry Gibson make amusing appearances, and a surprise guest arrives late in the game for some over-the-top scene-stealing.

In an Academy Award-winning Best Actor performance, burly Wallace Beery - he of the fog-cutter voice and gruff warmth - plays the washed-up prizefighter making a ring comeback to provide for his son. Nine-year-old Our Gang comedy star Jackie Cooper is Dink, as devoted a son as ever stood in any man's corner. Laugh. Cry. Cheer. Cry some more. Even as The Champ breaks your heart, it heals the spirit.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002EAYDQ6", "B002EAYEFQ", "B002PAP6HU", "B0007TKNJ2", "B000GRUQLA", "B000BYA4II", "B000G6ORIE", "B0000648ZW", "B00D3K357O", "B008D1Q1TM", "B000GRUQK6", "B0006HBV3W", "B0051WTN50", "B0006TPDSO", "B000YRY7VC", "B0009S4IKQ", "B000F7CMXQ", "B0009NZ2NS", "B0007PALPW", "B00APQGPAS", "B00KE3B9US", "B0079R1KVA", "B00012FXJ0", "B008D19ZPY", "B003VA3JW2", "B00KTZALDC", "B003SZUJT6", "B004H0M322", "B00D9BNONW", "B000ZM1MJG", "6305081832", "B000BYA4HE", "B00EOBB866", "B0011WN03K", "B00AEBBA7W", "B000244EZ6", "B006QS9M1S", "B0045HCJS0", "B0033PSH7M", "B00EKGX2P0", "B001QFFBAC", "B000E8JO32", "B000B5XOYS", "B00008ZZ7B", "B001709LD4", "B0002XNT08", "B00000F17E", "B00ICWO1LC", "B00K6D1S7A", "B00003L9CI", "B00006RCO3", "B0082SICCU", "0780021312", "B000F7CMQI", "B00K6D1RO4", "B00011D1OK", "B0012GVMI0", "B007FQXEQO", "B002945DUW", "B007FQXEVY", "B001GUYAZY", "B00D23GOVG", "B000ND91WW", "B0009X75O2", "B00A01CQIS", "B00EOBB636", "B006H37P2K", "B002GSXKQA", "B0058KEVBQ", "B000BITV92", "B0024FAG1M", "B000AP04M4", "B00007CVSA", "B00005U2KC", "B0024FAG1C", "B00005U2K5", "B008BFSMBA", "B000QGE8J2", "B00074DY0W", "B000E6ESX0", "B00GPPXNLC", "B00AEFY7NM", "B00005AUKB", "B000HWZ4C0", "B0006H32DY", "B00G9W7N6W", "B00005JP4J", "B0047BXR1C", "B00553K8DQ", "B000056HEE", "B003UN2I4K", "B000A9QK7I", "B000YQT7QI", "B0017I79BW", "B00AEFY6DI", "B003ZEQMH8", "B006FE83T0", "B00005PJ6T", "B009RNK10K", "B0012GVMIK"], "bought_together": ["B002EAYEFQ", "B002EAYDQ6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000648ZW", "B002EAYDQ6", "B00004TJQJ", "B000GRUQLA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 49328}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.94, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000BYA4H4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MYYYEbccL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Champ"}
{"description": "Three world-class directors put their auteurist stamps on this anthology of films dealing with sex, desire, and obsession. First, and best, is \"The Hand,\" Wong Kar-Wai's ravishing drama set in 1960s Hong Kong. Chang Chen stars as an apprentice tailor who becomes enthrall to an imperious, tragically downwardly mobile courtesan (Gong Li). During their first meeting, she takes a hands-on interest in his sexual initiation, explaining that the memory will inspire him to make beautiful clothes for her. Steven Soderbergh lightens the mood with \"Equilibrium,\" starring Robert Downey Jr. as a very anxious 1950s adman relating a curious dream to a very distracted psychiatrist (the always wonderful Alan Arkin). Last, and sadly, least, is Michelangeolo Antonioni's \"The Dangerous Thread of Things\" about an estranged couple, a tryst, and dancing nude on the beach. A world away from such towering masterworks asL'Aventura, it's elusive and pretentious, almost like anSCTVparody of 1960s foreign films. But here, for the more prurient viewers, is the earthy, gratuitious nudity and frolicking sex for which one might desire in a movie titledEros.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00LT1JHLW", "B000BRBA8S", "B0010SAGHS", "B000E33W0I", "B008MPQ0R2", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B0002X7GWU", "B004YCKJNI", "B000A1OFZA", "B001O7SWHG", "B000EU1ONS", "B0016MJ6HY", "B000NO1XG8", "B000GBEWPC", "B00HVOFP6W", "B00061I29E", "B00K0MM4AM", "B00003CXUM", "B00003JRAV", "B004KVXC64", "B00GPPXNLC", "B004SEUJEG", "B00005M1ZQ", "B00BNWWUDY", "B00064AFK0", "B00AOO5PXO", "B005BJ7XL4", "B008220DIC", "B00005BHW6", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B00ET2ODX0", "B004H0M2WI", "B004SUDQC2", "B00006LPER", "B00BJSLNN0", "B001BPB5YI", "B0000694XY", "B00IKM5OYW", "B00GB0OVV2", "B0027BOL46", "B00HE011DE", "B00HGBAG5K", "B0071HPP1Y", "B001DE29SS", "B003C9VEVK", "B000QXDCLA", "B000092T3H", "B000YV1Q30", "B00IGK6TH4", "B00GPPXP6A", "B0009GX1XI", "B0000A1HR4", "B0041LULL2", "B00JPQ1I7O", "B005D0RDWK", "B001TK80CA", "B00E1HIWXU", "B000NVT0SO", "B000065V3B", "B002P7UCJK", "B00DZP1C3Q", "B000JGWD50", "B00ATK015K", "B00F98FOFY", "B001PYD0KW", "B006GVNHUM", "B00004W21Z", "B000FZEU0G", "B000F3UA6Q", "B00023P4I8", "B00BSN0VZ2", "B001EKGQX0", "B00005JMIJ", "B000C3L2P2", "B00003CXDJ", "B000PKG8TM", "B000E1NXJ0", "B00022S7EC", "B003ZJ9572", "B00004W229", "6304884370", "B00000F7E6", "B006MGWBWQ", "B00GBT62PQ", "B0031REQAO", "B001CW7ZT4", "6305460183", "B00005JL57", "B00B2BYXSG", "B00782O7LG", "B001O2UTRC", "B000OY8NBK", "B002ZG9940", "B009AVC936", "B00005Y6XB", "B002P7UCBI", "B00097DY2A", "B002M9WW5I", "B0000687DE", "B0064MT1NU"], "bought_together": ["B000BRBA8S", "B0010SAGHS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000NO1XG8", "B000E33W0I", "B00AOO5PXO", "B001O7SWHG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 202745}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.07, "brand": "Warner Bros", "asin": "B000C3L26Q", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VXWFV7YCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Eros"}
{"description": "On the surface, David Cronenberg may seem an unlikely candidate to directA History of Violence, but dig deeper and you'll see that he's the right man for the job. As an intellectual seeker of meaning and an avowed believer in Darwinian survival of the fittest, Cronenberg knows that the story of mild-mannered small-town diner proprietor Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) is in fact a multilayered examination of inbred human behavior, beginning when Tom's skillful killing of two would-be robbers draws unwanted attention to his idyllic family life in rural Indiana. He's got a loving wife (Maria Bello) and young daughter (Heidi Hayes) who are about to learn things about Tom they hadn't suspected, and a teenage son (Ashton Holmes) who has inherited his father's most prominent survival trait, manifesting itself in ways he never expected. By the time Tom has come into contact with a scarred villain (Ed Harris) and connections that lead him to a half-crazy kingpin (William Hurt, in a spectacular cameo), Cronenberg has plumbed the dark depths of human nature so skillfully thatA History of Violencestands well above the graphic novel that inspired it (indeed, Cronenberg was unaware of the source material behind Josh Olson's chilling adaptation). With hard-hitting violence that's as sudden as it is graphically authentic, this isA History of Violencethat's worthy of serious study and widespread acclaim.--Jeff ShannonOn the DVDOn a single disc and with little fanfare, this DVD makes an excellent case for the best extras of the year. Dive into the one-hour-long documentary and learn more about moviemaking than on many a double-disc. The secret lies in director David Cronenberg's (and his usual crew) folksy casualness in showing off the craft, be it makeup (green screens were used), directing (Cronenberg doesn't storyboard), or art direction (the diner set). It also is very funny to hear about \"fish Fridays\" and how Maria Bello's Uncle Pete became an influence. Even the infamous sex-on-the-staircase scene is diagnosed with candor as stars Viggo Mortensen and Bello act as if there is no backstage camera. There's only one deleted scene, but it's uncommonly deconstructed on why it was filmed and why it was cut (it's a very Cronenbergian dream sequence). A short bit on Cannes is also a delight. So much is here that Cronenberg's smart commentary track is nearly superfluous. Isn't that a nice surprise?--Doug ThomasMore to ExploreThe Graphic NovelOther Graphic Novels that Inspired MoviesDavid Cronenberg EssentialsWhy We Love Maria BelloThe work of Viggo MortensenThe work of William HurtStills fromA History of ViolenceViggo Mortensoe as Tom StallAshton Holmes as Jack Stall and Kyle Schmid as Bobby JordanWilliam Hurt as Richie CusackEd Harris as Carl Fogarty and Viggo Mortensen as Tom StallMaria Bello as Edie StallDirector David Cronenberg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000YENUI6", "B001LRJH0U", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B008R65XP6", "B004SIP8ZM", "B001FB5634", "B0001EFV7C", "B00004W18Z", "B001EIOOWC", "6301971345", "B000M341QE", "B00000K31T", "B000GFLKF8", "B000P0J0D8", "0767802519", "B004SUDQ72", "B003ASLJQS", "B002PJYPYG", "6304698747", "B000F5WR4W", "B003Y5H4R0", "B0018O4YT0", "B00AEBB9CS", "B0028OH568", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00000JDIQ", "B000FUTVLY", "B002AT8KAG", "B000XR9L50", "6305313687", "0783228457", "B002QEHPQU", "B001FB55L2", "B000Y7WGOW", "B002VWNIEA", "B00022XE6S", "B006PTL1QM", "B000P0J0AG", "B004499LX0", "B00005JMOW", "B002T9H2LA", "B001TOD92C", "B005OK721G", "B000FKO5QK", "B0019EXZY4", "B002ZG99N6", "B0007DFJ0G", "B003LR5BD0", "B003RHZ6F2", "B00AEFY5B6", "B000N6TX1I", "0792833279", "B005LAIIJY", "B000FVQM2Y", "B000FC2FX8", "B001BNFRB2", "B00005JN0W", "B002XMGGK6", "B00007E8UI", "B0064NTZQ2", "B00D3DJIG8", "B0010DR4BO", "B0013XZ6X4", "B00AEFXE9U", "B007D5E7C2", "B000ALM40I", "B00001ZWUS", "B00005V9HH", "B00008RH3L", "0783229402", "B000QXDCLK", "B000P0J0EW", "B000BBOUUE", "B000A7DVR2", "B000K7VHQ4", "B00000F4MA", "B000XA5K48", "B00004XPPB", "B0002IQMAM", "B00029LNYQ", "B00003CXWV", "B004XQO90O", "B000GIW9I2", "B004U7MR14", "B002DKGWSE", "B0064MT1FI", "B0000TANUI", "B009T3AE1Y", "B0000VLKVM", "B00006LPGP", "B00005JLRE", "B000F7CMRM", "B00AEFXESQ", "B001DZOC64", "1558908315", "B0036TGTDE", "B000NOKFHQ", "B008220DGE", "B00007AJE1", "B000BVM1S2"], "bought_together": ["B000YENUI6", "B001LRJH0U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000YENUI6", "B008MILL78", "B009T3AE1Y", "B000M341QE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 45602}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.36, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B000CQLZ0Q", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51g0dghsrYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A History of Violence (New Line Platinum Series) [DVD]"}

{"description": "A decade after their last hilarious short, the Oscar-winningA Close Shave, Claymation wonders Wallace and Gromit return for a full-length adventure. Daffy scientist Wallace (voiced by Peter Sallis) and his heroic dog Gromit are doing well with their business, Anti-Pesto, a varmint-hunting outfit designed to keep their English town safe from rabbits chomping on prized vegetables. Wallace meets Lady Tottington (Helena Bonham Carter), who appreciates Wallace's humane way of dealing with rabbits (courtesy of the Bun-Vac 6000), and sets up a rivalry with the gun-toting Victor Quartermaine (Ralph Fiennes, enjoying himself more than ever). Creator Nick Park, with co-director/writer Steve Box, delivers a story worthy of the 85-minute running time, although it stretches the act a bit; the formula plays better shorter, but the literally hand-crafted film is a joy to watch. Taking a chapter from classic horror films, a giant were-rabbit is soon on the prowl, and the town is up in arms, what with the annual vegetable contest close at hand. (Anyone who's seen the previous three shorts knows who saves the day.) Never content to do something simply when the extravagant will do, W&G;'s lives are filled with whimsical Rude Goldberg-style devices, and the opening number showcasing their alarm system is pure Aardman Animation at its finest. Even though there's a new twist here--a few mild sight gags aimed at adults--this G-rated film will delight young and old alike as Park, like team Pixar, seems incapable of making anything but an outstanding film.--Doug ThomasSee more clay animation and Wallace &amp; Gromit titles...Director Nick Park on DVDStop-Motion &amp; Clay Animation TitlesWallace &amp; GromitStuff Galore", "related": {"also_bought": ["B006W4KVI4", "B002DPVI0Q", "B001LXIDTK", "B00003CXJ4", "B001LXIDTA", "B001LXIDT0", "B002DR2GJQ", "B000M343BC", "B000W089WO", "B001OC6RZA", "B001F0TT8I", "B004AGN9MG", "B000AA4JNE", "B002ZG4QDE", "B000A2UBOI", "B003BJODIC", "B004KV93AI", "B00005JNQS", "B000H7JCK0", "B0072GOJ48", "B006W4KRRY", "B002WJI2QQ", "B0012EM5D8", "B002D755B2", "B0006JMLRK", "B0000640SC", "B004ZQJ5FQ", "B001DPHDCY", "0783231474", "6305161887", "B000MV9026", "B0034G4P26", "B001ECQ75A", "B0045I3EQA", "B000BITUVG", "B005FNLUFQ", "B000ION23A", "B007Z2DO0E", "B003XEKXWK", "B004HO6I4M", "B001GCUO7A", "B003TJM60G", "B000AY74OG", "B003E66Y84", "B00000JL8E", "B00005JMQZ", "B00009M9BK", "B000DWMYQ8", "B00003CXG7", "B0000AK7AB", "B00029LO0Y", "B0001906W2", "B0006UEVT0", "B00CWM58WY", "B000RMJ4F8", "B002ZG97YM", "B0019BI11E", "B0052MXJ3Q", "B0034G4P1W", "B000MNOX9E", "B004EPZ034", "B00DBVHHDS", "B00I6JOD2S", "B005LAIHW2", "B000IFRT2O", "B005F96UJ6", "1782760326", "B0039N74CW", "B0045ZAQS2", "B000BB1MI2", "B000UVKGPI", "B0030ZIZRC", "B000C3L27U", "B001PR0YEE", "B003UAKE9Y", "B005SDUV4E", "B001HN6918", "B003RHZ6IE", "B001FTIJS0", "B0013FSL3E", "B00CO9N6CY", "B000VBJEEG", "B00009YXAW", "B0015XWUAY", "B00AEFYXD6", "B00007LVCM", "B0034GK74G", "B0042U94UQ", "B00CHVJODE", "B00008G8LM", "B00A8KJK7G", "B000G75AZC", "B00005JN4W", "B000ROAK2W", "B005LAII62", "B00E00OGE2", "B007J3ISKK", "6305123454"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXJ4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0044RFTBA", "B002DPVI0Q", "B00I0VTOMG", "B001LXIDTA"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5628}, "asin": "B000CZ0PT4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61MzjQMqG%2BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (Widescreen Edition)"}

In the year 2055, a technology has been invented that enables people to go back in time to hunt dinosaurs. When one such expedition to the Prehistoric past unwittingly makes a fatal mistake it dramatically impacts the course of evolution, setting off waves of destruction that ripple toward the modern world and unleashing an army of fearsome creatures that never should have existed. Two scientists race against time to fix the catastrophic error while their world collapses around them and every minute brings the human race closer to extinction.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001BSBBJE", "B002Y2BDEE", "B00005JKLZ", "0060785691", "B0007CEXUY", "6305090564", "B000087F6L", "B00IKM5LXG", "B00AEFYXQI", "B00D9EJFZA", "B004RBC5S8", "B001A7GOCA", "B000E5N6B6", "B00AEBB8QK", "B002DLB17K", "B0031U8OE0", "B005H3AZ50", "B000EHQ7Y2", "B0041SI78O", "B00368PSN2", "B0002CR03Q", "B005FQ2H8W", "B00AGKHF1G", "B002GHHHL0", "B000RW5BZ0", "B00D9EJFV4", "B00358MG8S", "B00BNAE14W", "B001EAWMGA", "B002TZS5GU", "B0001Z52RU", "B00IYRLUAU", "B004XQO90O", "B00FQPLZ08", "B0073U2FB2", "B0077PTWCI", "B000U1ZV7Q", "6305761078", "B00IWTVDUW", "B000JBXHQY", "B00GSTHC7G", "B007N3202S", "B00153ZR8G", "B0045HCJSA", "B001BGS17Q", "B00AIBZMM2", "B00AEFYCW8", "B00003CWRF", "B001GM6C44", "B00AEBB94G", "B00BTYNXJG", "B00006JDVV", "6305869367", "B003CLANAG", "B0007R4T26", "B00H83EUQW", "B0007N1JC8", "B000OCZ9WS", "B001KO1BCG", "B002VA59ZS", "B008JFUQZ2", "B000QGEB1W", "B0041SI78Y", "B001NFNFFS", "B0077PTWLO", "B008JFUO4U", "0783225520", "B0045HCJ0S", "B000IHY9TS", "B000063UR0", "B00003CWU3", "B007X4ECMI", "B00008G8M4", "B008JFUNHI", "B00JL6L4WC", "B00BJB2FCU", "B000BUNZY2", "B007WYPRAU", "B000FVQLKW", "B00AMEZDPG", "B00AEFXPSK", "B00004YA66", "B000096IAC", "B00005JLWN", "B008CAVVDU", "B00005JL78", "B002QW7ALM", "B0006Z2LJC", "B008JFUO36", "B00BOXZAJ8", "B00CTSDDVO", "B00005JPD0", "B000031EG1", "B00151QYOO", "B00DSAUJ32", "B005LAIHXQ", "B00BLF9FOK", "B008JFUN50", "B000JYW5DW", "B003Y5H5FG"], "bought_together": ["B001BSBBJE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JKLZ", "0060785691", "B0007CEXUY", "B0041SI78O"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 60439}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.49, "brand": "Gaiam", "asin": "B000CZ0PNK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519559Z964L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Sound of Thunder (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "The Leopard Man (1943, 66 min.)- Adapted from the Cornell Woolrich novel Black Alibi, The Leopard Man is a lesser but still fascinating psychological-horror effort from producer Val Lewton. Someone has been killing off the citizens of a small New Mexico town, and the most likely suspect is a huge leopard, purchased for a local nightclub act by press agent Jerry Manning (Dennis O'Keefe). Neither Manning nor his star Clo-Clo (Margo) are totally convinced that the big cat is responsible, and as it turns out they're right. The haunting finale takes place during the annual \"Dance of the Dead\" festivities, during which the genuine predator is revealed. The opening sequence of Leopard Man, atmospherically detailing the last few moments of murder victim Teresa Delgado (Margaret Landry), is so powerful that the rest of the film seems anticlimactic. Long available only in its 59-minute reissue form, the film was restored to its original 65-minute running time in the mid-1980s.\n\nThe Ghost Ship (1943, 69 min.)- RKO horror producer Val Lewton dished up seven reels of brooding psychological terror with The Ghost Ship. Richard Dix stars as the ship's captain, a tortured soul who teeters on the verge of madness. Seaman Russell Wade notices the captain's deterioration, but his warnings are dismissed by the crew. Captain Dix completely goes over the edge, sadistically playing a game of cat and mouse with the luckless Wade--and endangering the lives of everyone on board. While the viewer may notice that Ghost Ship closely resembles the Jack London tale The Sea Wolf, playwrights Samuel R. Golding and Norbert Faulkner felt that the film was too close for comfort to an unproduced play of their own. The writers sued RKO, forcing the studio to withdraw Ghost Ship from theatres and prohibiting future TV showings.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000DZBNKS", "B000A0GOF0", "B0024FADCE", "B000A0GOFA", "B000A0GOFK", "B0000UX4X0", "B000N3T0H8", "B004P9UWLY", "B00005BH23", "B00000G02H", "B00DOZNGC2", "B00407PNWO", "B0000694WH", "B00D9EJFZA", "B00HFWETZ8", "B000WNHTCC", "B00DZP1C9K", "B003N2CVRC", "B000FWHW90", "B00D9EJFV4", "B00000K3U3", "0783240961", "B001B9ZVVC", "B000W4D94S", "B000UAFDR0", "B000FWHW8Q", "B000VX9WB4", "B000EHSVJG", "B00005LC4N", "B00009PY4D", "B0009X75EC", "B001ARDBXU", "B00027JYMG", "B00005LC4L", "B00005LC4J", "B000RXVNDI", "0292716281", "B000HEVZ7G", "B002945DUW", "B00009PY45", "B000EHQTZO", "B000FFJ83U", "B001BSBBGC", "B00FJYXP36", "B0000694WM", "B0087ZG7OI", "B0009X770E", "B0007R4T26", "6305761078", "B00FERT0PK", "B000G6BLYM", "B00I9BU3M2", "B000UDGOB6", "B00005LC4O", "B00FQPLZ08", "B000FVQLKW", "B00005R1O7", "B00005AUK1", "B000068TPG", "B000EXDSBQ", "B00DE1LD6W", "B00005JKGX", "B000FKO3VM", "B0024FAG8A", "B00H7BJ0C4", "B000RXVND8", "B003ICZW7I", "B000B83846", "B009AGEY98", "B00EL6A7XE", "B000B8380A", "B00009NHC0", "B001HNDR4A", "B000AQKU72", "B00DSAUJ32", "B00000C0QO", "B000CNE088", "B00CUKTHES", "B0028DRGDQ", "B0089LT800", "B000063UR0", "B00005O5CA", "6305869367", "0783240953", "B00AY586X4", "B00AEBBA7W", "B00158K1AA", "B00508W2Z8", "B00275EHDM", "B00480OBXA", "B005D0RDKM", "B0013XZ6SY", "B000AP04M4", "B005ETANC2", "B000UDGOBG", "B005ETAL9C", "B000RXVNCY", "B000BYA5I2", "B00DZP1BVO", "B004H0M32M"], "bought_together": ["B000DZBNKS", "B000A0GOF0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000A0GOEQ", "B000A0GOF0", "B0024FADCE", "B000A0GOFK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 140735}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.57, "brand": "WB", "asin": "B000DZD9SM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZSRMG2GJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Leopard Man (1943)/The Ghost Ship"}

{"description": "The legend of Pocahontas and John Smith receives a luminous and essential retelling by maverick filmmaker Terrence Malick. The facts of Virginia's first white settlers, circa 1607, have been told for eons and fortified by Disney's animated films: explorer Smith (Colin Farrell) and the Native American princess (newcomer Q'orianka Kilcher) bond when the two cultures meet, a flashpoint of curiosity and war lapping interchangeably at the shores of the new continent. Malick, who took a twenty year break between his second and third films (Days of Heaven and The Thin Red Line), is a master of film poetry; the film washes over you, with minimal dialogue (you see characters speak on camera for less than a quarter of the film). The rest of the words are a stream-of-consciousness narration--a technique Malick has used before but never to such degree, creating a movie you feel more than watch. The film's beauty (shot in Virginia by Emmanuel Lubezki) and production design (by Jack Fisk) seems very organic, and in fact, organic is a great label for the movie as a whole, from the dreadful conditions of early Jamestown (it makes you wonder why Englishman would want to live there) to the luminescent love story. Malick is blessed with a cast that includes Wes Studi, August Schellenberg, Christopher Plummer, and Christian Bale (who, curiously, was also in the Disney production). Fourteen-year-old Kilcher, the soul of the film, is an amazing find, and Farrell, so often tagged as the next big thing, delivers his first exceptional performance since his stunning debut in Tigerland. James Horner provides a fine score, but is overshadowed by a Mozart concerto and a recurring prelude from Wagner's Das Rheingold, a scrumptious weaving of horns fit to fuel the gentle intoxication of this film. Note: the film was initially 150 minutes, and then trimmed to 135 by Malick before the regular theatrical run. It was also the first film shot in 65mm since Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet. --Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000NOKFHQ", "B000VMIILU", "B000TXNDV6", "B00005PJ8T", "1573623903", "B000UVV24M", "B005LLX582", "B000MGB6NM", "B005KQVE1S", "B000FIHN5M", "B00CX7OW1G", "B003M987QK", "B0012Q732O", "B00003CXBH", "B0009PW4EQ", "B0002Y4PPK", "B005HV6Y5W", "B003LL3FIY", "B00J11U54K", "B004UOHNIY", "B000VKL6ZM", "B00KHWSB5M", "B0001I55YW", "B002O3Z50Q", "B00005QW6V", "0783231202", "B00004XPPG", "B00003CXAF", "B000ARXF8W", "B001MZ5W3M", "B003EYVXRS", "B00406UK7S", "B000A2WP7O", "B00I6JODGO", "B004AOECXI", "B000AARKOO", "B000J4QWMC", "B002GHHHHO", "B0018BD9DA", "B004C45AZU", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B0013D8LC2", "B003EYVXXW", "B0007UDC80", "B000R9U3B0", "B007PXYWNQ", "B0032LV4LS", "B003Y5H5FG", "B00019330O", "B0000TANUI", "B000UJ48SQ", "B00007GZYC", "B000F7CMRM", "B00005JKTP", "B0002YLCG0", "B004P2VQZC", "B002O3Z510", "B006ISJQ26", "B009AMAJPA", "B00009MEKN", "B007WZTMCI", "B003L20IG0", "B000CEV3P0", "B0002DRDBY", "B000ZOXDFA", "B000ASDFF4", "B00AEBB89W", "B00AEFXVCU", "B008220C38", "B00005JLX2", "B007REV4LQ", "B009INAI02", "B000XR9L50", "B005LAII3A", "B00005OSJN", "B002DHACT2", "B00BB67UNW", "B008JFUNKU", "B00005R23V", "B00140PK82", "B00005221M", "B000087F0X", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B004EPYZT4", "B003UYUQZW", "B00AEFY5B6", "B004CQZFH6", "B002ZG977Y", "0800177967", "B001L57ZZG", "B00DL48BM6", "B001JIE7JC", "B003Y7F1OG", "B000N3SU92", "B000NIVJF4", "B001KO1BCQ", "B005J7K9BO", "B000LC55F2", "B0045HCJ9O"], "bought_together": ["B000NOKFHQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000NOKFHQ", "B00005PJ8T", "B005LLX582", "B000VMIILU"]}, "price": 10.08, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 386879}, "asin": "B000EOTTTU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519FGGE3C5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The New World"}

{"description": "Battle In Heaven, Carlos Reygadas&#x92; follow-up toJap&#xF3;n, opens with a controversial oral sex scene involving beauty, Ana (Anapola Mushkadiz), and the beast, Marcos (Marcos Hern&#xE1;ndez). Marcos is Ana&#x92;s chauffeur, who has kidnapped and accidentally killed a baby. Ana, a general&#x92;s daughter by day and a prostitute by night, confides in Marcos and performs sexual favors for him in order to persuade him to turn himself in. She is too young, however, to understand Marcos&#x92;s confused mental state, and her sensitive position with him puts her in peril. Set in Mexico City, this tragic drama is as much about failed intimacy as it is about Mexican class structure, as Ana and Marcos attempt to bridge the class gap. A few explicit sex scenes show Marcos in bed with Ana or his wife (Bertha Ruiz), thus garnering it reviews that compare it toThe Brown Bunny. In fact, the slow pacing and artsy, self-consciously composed shots do remind one ofThe Brown Bunny, in that both films are initially interesting but grow dull as their plots take forever to unfold. An intriguing plot is buried under seemingly eternal panoramic shots of the city, painfully slow conversation between characters, and constant close-ups of Marcos&#x92; face that are meant to capture his angst but only deter narrative. Nevertheless, this film&#x92;s merit is based in its experimental energy, and any director who follows up a graphic sex scene with a cut to the waving of the country&#x92;s flag (in this case Mexico&#x92;s) has my respect.--Trinie Dalton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002C8YSDI", "B000FZEQB4", "B00CQ8HCUK", "B0076ANKUY", "B00C8CQ5SO", "B00INUK5WM", "B001AZKB8K", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B000BGH29K", "B00003JRAV", "B0015FHDWM", "B000L6S92E", "B003XKNGNW", "B004GBMVTW", "B00APUAKYG", "B003B2UK1S", "B006Z7Z3VS", "B000FZEQCS", "B0009VRHLK", "B00GPPXNIK", "B002R3CQDC", "B00GRZPRB4", "B00K0MM4AM", "B003W2XOTW", "B0007TZHWA", "B00JDOQM38", "B00023P4I8", "B00FZA2YAE", "B00CQ8HCSM", "B002N7SX8E", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B00009W0U4", "B005DU58QS", "B00AYGVCCK", "B003KGBISE", "B00B0LKUKI", "B00DRJ9G4M", "B000F0UUD2", "B000OYNVOO", "B0002DB52M", "B0026LYMAU", "B0001KL58U", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B0002KQNPO", "B001NY43KA", "B00005K9O8", "B00JDOQMH4", "B00IA1VQBS", "B003ODKZTQ", "B002JCYSL4", "B000059XTM", "B000LAZDQA", "B001AIQ14A", "B002T4GY4Q", "B0004Z32NI", "B0009XRZQK", "B00DPUB56U", "B0048FQFFM", "B00A7WHL08", "B00BLQBQYQ", "B003R9IET0", "B005HWAOLQ", "B00005U14H", "B003D3367U", "B00GS08Y3Q", "B007PZ6STK", "B000DZ95MG", "B001TR4G7G", "B000Q7ZKX4", "B00CFK5J9U", "B00368PSNC", "B000RJEI84", "B001CIOCNK", "B00H0EN948", "B004SEUJEG", "B00AKLLSNC", "B002DQSKMY", "B00FHZDDH0", "B001M9ELV2", "B0000714E8", "B00GA9F2PI", "B00HE010QM", "B00B0LL0E8", "B00DDXEJDA", "B00003CXXY", "B00GU05MXE", "B00GBT6332", "B001PYD0KW", "B000TXPXAU", "B000LV6OAS", "B0040J1RX6", "B00005JMIJ", "B00B022GVS"], "bought_together": ["B00CQ8HCUK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00GPPXNIK", "B002C8YSDI", "B003B2UK1S", "B00005JMIJ"]}, "price": 17.78, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 57073}, "asin": "B000EZ8ZRG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5100EE4ZKZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Battle In Heaven"}
{"description": "The premise sounds like the most crass 1980s teen sex comedy imaginable: A teenage boy dying of cancer makes a last wish to spend a weekend alone with a supermodel. YetOne Last Thing...is neither crass nor a sex comedy, but rather a surprisingly touching exploration of taking chances, mortality, spirituality, and the price of love. Dylan (Michael Angarano,Sky High) has been granted a conventional dying wish by a foundation, but at the televised press conference he changes his mind and asks for a weekend with blond sex symbol Nikki Sinclair (Sunny Mabrey,Snakes on a Plane). The consequences unfold realistically: The supermodel (who has her own problems) and her agent (Gina Gershon,Bound) show up for a brief photo opportunity, then split--but Dylan, with the help of his friends, goes to New York to follow up on her promise to go out with him if he visits. The core ofOne Last Thing...is Dylan's relationship with his mother (Cynthia Nixon,Sex and the City), one of the most real and affecting mother-son relationships on film. The actors--including an uncredited Ethan Hawke (Before Sunset)--are uniformly excellent, giving this potentially absurd set-up a remarkable emotional integrity.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B0002KPIQY", "B00003CWQR", "B000C3L2PC", "B00CPTUO1Y", "B00005JPAR", "B0007Q6VXC", "B000AP04L0", "B000CNET0C", "B000PKG8TW", "B001OSC4G0", "B001VPCINK", "B000NY0YKE", "B000OU0826", "B004XQO8LY", "0783226012", "B000K6TOK6", "B00H9HZITU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0006J28MI", "B0002KPIQY", "B001CRC4DG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 269781}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.91, "brand": "MAGNOLIA HOME ENTERTAINMENT", "asin": "B000F4RHAM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5131XJDYSYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "One Last Thing..."}

During the peak of the Third Reich, Sophie Scholl (Julia Jentsch,The Edukators), along with her brother Hans and other students in Munich, formed a resistance group called the White Rose and distributed anti-Nazi leaflets.Sophie Schollbegins on a crisp winter day, with Sophie and Hans distributing leaflets around the empty halls of a university before class is let out.  The tension only increases as they are arrested, interrogated, and swiftly convicted in a brutal show trial. The heart of the film are the scenes between Sophie and her interrogator, Robert Mohr (Gerald Alexander Held), a loyal Nazi who nonetheless respected and perhaps even admired Sophie.  Their arguments, distilled down from hours of historical record, crackle with emotion and resonate throughout history, from Communist totalitarianism to the Bush administration condemning critics of the Iraq war as traitors. Jentsch's restrained performance only grows more and more moving over the movie's course.

{"description": "AfterWelcome to SarajevoandIn This World,The Road to Guant&#xE1;namois Michael Winterbottom's most important film. Along withUnited 93, it's one of the most important films released byanyonein 2006. In the docudrama, which was produced for British television, Winterbottom and Mat Whitecross recount the travails of the Tipton Three, a trio of Britons detained for two years at Guant&#xE1;namo Bay. How did these apolitical Muslims end up as suspected terrorists? The directors attempt to answer that question by inter-cutting interviews and news footage with recreations of their Kafka-esque journey. It starts with a trip to Pakistan for the wedding of Asif (Afran Usman). In short order, he's joined by Ruhel (Farhad Harun), Shafiq (Riz Ahmed), and Monir (Waqar Siddiqui). On a whim, they decide to visit Afghanistan: \"One, for experience, and two, to help.\" It proves to be their undoing. First, they're caught in a bombing raid; then the Northern Alliance rounds them up as members of al-Qaeda. In the m&#xEA;l&#xE9;e, Monir goes missing. The remaining three are shipped to Cuba, where US officials stop at nothing to coerce confessions.

{"description": "It's inevitable thatThe Groomsmenwould invite comparisons toWedding Crashers, but it's actually closer in spirit toDiner. Or Fellini's semi-autobiographicalI Vitelloni, which writer/director Edward Burns has claimed as an influence. Sure, the film has its comedic moments, but it isn't a comedy. Sure, Burns and his on-screen pals can be louts, but that's where the similarities to the Owen Wilson/Vince Vaughn vehicle end. There's only one wedding in the picture and Paulie (Burns) doesn't need to crash it--he's the one getting married. His fianc&#xE9;e, Sue (Brittany Murphy, who worked with Burns onSidewalks of New York), is pregnant, so the time has come. Paulie, a Long Island reporter, isn't sure he's ready for the responsibility of marriage and fatherhood. His best buddies, Dez (Mathew Lillard), T.C. (John Leguizamo), cousin Mike (Jay Mohr), and brother Jimbo (Donal Logue), aren't exactly helping to prepare him for the big day. That's because they've got problems of their own and because they're more concerned about getting the band together one last time (a humorous, if overly familiar plot device). Since 1995 breakout hitThe Brothers McMullen, originality hasn't been Burns's strong suit andThe Groomsmenis no exception, although the believable camaraderie between characters serves to distract from the clich&#xE9;s.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "The Promisecame to American shores with endless hype about its visual splendor--and for once, the hype is deserved. Lush and luminous, almost every shot will make you want to weep from its sheer loveliness. A starving young orphan girl named Qingcheng is offered a deal by a capricious goddess: The girl will be staggeringly beautiful and have all the wealth, delicious food, and fabulous clothing she could ask for--but every man she ever loves will die. Thus begins a twisty tale in which a fleet-footed slave (Korean actor Dong-Kun Jang) and a mighty general (Japanese actor Hiroyuki Sanada,The White Countess) compete for the love of the adult Qingcheng (Hong Kong beauty Cecilia Cheung), while a vengeful usurper (Hong Kong star Nicholas Tse,Time and Tide) seeks to destroy them all. Like many of the classics of Hong Kong fantasy--such asA Chinese Ghost Story,Swordsman II, andGreen Snake--The Promisecombines the epic storylines of Chinese mythology with the headlong momentum and energetic editing of kung-fu action movies. The result can sometimes seem absurd to American audiences--though these same audiences will happily swallow the absurdities of American science fiction, simply because they're familiar with the conventions of the genre. Viewers who embrace the conventions of Hong Kong fantasy will findThe Promiseengaging and emotionally rich...and there's just no denying the gorgeousness. Compared with the sterile spectacle of the laterStar Warsmovies or the clumsy, laboredMatrixsequels,The Promisebursts with human warmth, dynamic storytelling, and elegant design. More Western audiences should open themselves to its pleasures.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B008XEZXES", "B0019PL2W0", "B00G3HOJZ6", "B00151QYEO", "B00065GX0K", "B000MRA592", "B00B1CGFD2", "B006C1S1DY", "B000ICLU7C", "B00AN5LCXQ", "B004XFZ3UU", "B009VL2AZM", "B00BEJL6JK", "B000E1EHPE", "B0007Q6VXC", "B0051SFTGQ", "B00104AYGK", "B00ENTX7JU", "B008IG0B0C", "B006MWA91A", "B009VL2A5M", "B0089BSO8C", "B0018PH3NS", "B00HEPDGKA", "B000QGEB12", "B005FQ1OOK", "B000Y7U98C", "B002C6VMIY", "B008OTTRE4", "B000P6R9N0", "B00B4MMVVY", "B00HSJ2EMI", "B000HXDWOG", "B00576U9HQ", "B00H47IXJW", "B00ET2ODYY", "B00GXFZOYI", "B0056OZI16", "B00EI3Y1QO", "B008645YLM", "B001MEJY9G", "B008FIPRGG", "B00003CXR4", "B00J11U54K", "B0034GK75K", "7885142833", "B007S0DCUU", "B00BTFK014", "B004TFTE9A", "B001L67A4G", "B008XEZXZC", "B006H3KQSK", "B00B6OEE7O", "B0010X741O", "B0035JHYHA", "B0033HKDXG", "B004VW4V9E", "B00009RXI6", "B0002CR086", "B000MGUZBQ", "B005M9VSMI", "B0058M0848", "7885142515", "B004SIP88Y", "B000JMK6LW", "B003WVJ65E", "B0090SI3ZW", "B000ERVJQ8", "B00AKIPBBK", "B001C0JCNS", "B000K2UW06", "B0043988KS", "B00AN5LCOA", "B0098461B6", "B005ZMBEXU", "B000006A17", "B002BWD7DM", "B00CKW3KV2", "B0030A6ICG", "B006UTDH6O", "B005T0OXWM", "B00C3ALL9O", "B001R10BDW", "B00ATXIIGG", "B000UNYK3U", "B001AZIRWW", "B005ZMBEXA", "B00DJ5IORY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B002E2QH2W", "B00393SFTS", "B008WAM36O", "B001O7SWHG", "B00687XNNK", "B000FELD8Y", "B004H2IMSO", "B0086460CY", "B002ZPIBRC", "B000X76ZGI", "B00CDSILB2"], "bought_together": ["B000MRA592", "B0007Q6VXC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0006IINIC", "B00065GX0K", "B002C6VMIY", "B006C1S1DY"]}, "price": 29.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 127708}, "asin": "B000JVSUXO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518qqF0U-EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Promise"}
{"description": "Moody dialogue, drab lighting, and characters who aren't quite who they say they are pepper the indie filmA Little Trip To Heaven. Starring Forest Whitaker as Holt (an insurance investigator looking into a man's suspicious death), and Julia Stiles as Isolde (the frightened and sketchy sister of the deceased),A Little Trip's destination actually is closer to hell than heaven. Unevenly portrayed and not well-fleshed out, not one of the characters is sympathetic. Isolde's brute of a husband is the prime suspect, but Holt--who in a different film would be the story's hero--isn't exactly a saint either. There's a particularly creepy scene where he's little more than a peeping Tom, justifying his perversion as doing what's necessary to get his job done. As shown in films such asHalf NelsonandSherrybaby, imperfect characters can make for compelling filmmaking.
