{"description": "This feature version of Rod Serling's memorable teleplay, theatrically released in 1962, was previously produced in 1956 for  live television. The grim tale stars Anthony Quinn as a brain-damaged fighter suffering from too many years in the ring yet pushed into another and yet another punishing round by his corrupt manager (Jackie Gleason). Yearning for a life of his own, Quinn's burned-out hitter falls for a shy social worker (Julie Harris), while Gleason's small-timer tries fending off the pressures of truly bad guys who want the money he owes them. Directed by Ralph Nelson (who also made the TV version), thisRequiemopens up into a powerful piece of social realism with the undercurrent of a cautionary fable. The characters are almost archetypal, the story never stops moving, the acting is superb (Mickey Rooney is very good as Quinn's reluctant trainer), and the ending is nightmarishly apt.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B002VRNJ08", "B001E1HCQY", "B000005YSI"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 292233}, "asin": "0767807693", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512XSXYK8DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Requiem for a Heavyweight [VHS]"}
{"description": "Lou Diamond Phillips leaves a haunting impression as the late 1950s pop idol Ritchie Valens, who made the Latino influence in rock &amp; roll conspicuous through his hit songs. Filmmaker Luis Valdez (Zoot Suit) creates a nimble, exciting, and sympathetic portrait of the boy driven to rise above obstacles of race and family legacy, and Esai Morales is equally fine as Ritchie's envious, searching brother. Great support from Elizabeth Pe&ntilde;a and Danielle von Zerneck as Valens's sister and mother, respectively, and Joe Pantoliano is solid as the singer's straight-talking manager. Valdez brightens up the third act with a rock &amp; roll show featuring, among others, Brian Setzer as Eddie Cochrane. Marshall Crenshaw turns up as Buddy Holly getting on that plane with Valens, and Los Lobos (who actually performs Valens's music on the soundtrack) has a nifty cameo as a Tijuana band that gives Valens a piece of crucial inspiration.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000P0J0CY", "B0001CNQX0", "B00000K3TX", "B00004RJ71", "B0002DRDIW", "B0000714BS", "B0000714BQ", "B000002LC8", "B003NF97NK", "0783114907", "B00180IPM6", "B00007J5VO", "B005HFI7IU", "B003E1QDAI", "B00004ZESY", "B000K2UGZM", "B000AM4P90", "B00AEBB9IM", "B0009R1TJ0", "B00005N89M", "B002WJHBCC", "B00AEFY5TI", "B000KJU15U", "B000063JDI", "B00465I1CE", "B000RHRGSK", "B002XUBDRY", "B00AEBB9ZK", "B003VA3JZY", "B00EE8AIW4", "6305428409", "B000GJ0LLI", "B0042837D8", "B0009IOR6Q", "B00AEFXZJE", "B0000DIXDR", "B004AOECXI", "B000K2Q7CI", "B0009HLC9W", "B00004Y2R1", "B00CAYH200", "6305428271", "B000065V3H", "B001GD6VTE", "B00441GYZG", "B001AEF6BS", "B0042EJDGM", "B000B74GCA", "0767821769", "B001D0T4JY", "0767812387", "B000P0J0C4", "B00009AOBI", "0800141806", "B000E8QVWY", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00005V9IA", "B0002VGTBQ", "0783228686", "B00006FDCD", "6305428050", "B00006RCOC", "B000N3T0HI", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00E1HIX66", "6305744793", "B00009AOAX", "B00008L3U1", "B00AMSS3TA", "B000E8QVBU", "B00005JND5", "B000ERVK3A", "B00081U7HC", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00AEFY5B6", "B0002VEZ3U", "B000FOPPC4", "B008IG0F4Y", "B001DJLD12", "B00003CXPS", "B000068TPB", "B00069FL7C", "B004IKZQPW", "B00158K0R4", "B000H5TH20", "B00AEFXPG2", "B00AEBBADG", "B001BGS16W", "B00003CXTG", "B0002TT0MI", "B0087F7VSY", "B0000AQS5F", "076780421X", "0767812182", "B002BIULKS", "6305213305", "B00004TJKK", "B00027JZ3E", "B00075VX2C", "B00006RZ9Y"], "bought_together": ["B000P0J0CY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004RJ71", "B000P0J0CY", "B000A50460", "B0001CNQX0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8913}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "Philips", "asin": "0767821637", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R7P26XWQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "La Bamba"}

{"description": "An extraordinary and deeply moving film that retains much of its power since its original release in 1959, Alain Resnais'sHiroshima, Mon Amouris the story of a French woman (Emmanuelle Riva) and a Japanese man (Eiji Okada) who become lovers in the city of Hiroshima, where  the U.S. dropped a nuclear bomb to end World War&nbsp;II in the Pacific. Written by Marguerite Duras and juggled, as if by wandering thoughts, in chronology and setting by Resnais, the film reveals the miserable and mortifying experiences of each character during the war and suggests the obvious healing properties of their relationship in the present. An emotional allusion or two can certainly be made with the more recentThe English Patient, but nothing can quite prepare one for Resnais's extreme yet intuitively accessible experiments in fusing the past, present, and future into great sweeps of subjectively experienced memory. Yet audiences have never had trouble relating to this bold milestone of the French New Wave, largely because at its heart is a genuinely affecting, soulful love story.--Tom Keogh", "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 464556}, "asin": "0780020200", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YQVWRWN0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hiroshima Mon Amour [VHS]"}

{"description": "The plotline may sound familiar: Two mismatched cops are assigned as reluctant partners to solve a crime. Culturally they are complete opposites, and they quickly realize they can't stand each other. One (Jackie Chan) believes in doing things by the book. He is a man with integrity and nerves of steel. The other (Chris Tucker) is an amiable rebel who can't stand authority figures. He's a man who has to do everything on his own, much to the displeasure of his superior officer, who in turn thinks this cop is a loose cannon but tolerates him because he gets the job done. Directed by Brett Ratner,Rush Hourdoesn't break any new ground in terms of story, stunts, or direction. It rehashes just about every \"buddy\" movie ever made--in fact, it makes films such asTango and Cashseem utterly original and clever by comparison. So, why did this uninspired movie make over $120 million at the box office? Was the whole world suffering from temporary insanity? Hardly. The explanation for the success ofRush Houris quite simple: chemistry. The casting of veteran action maestro Jackie Chan with the charming and often hilarious Chris Tucker was a serendipitous stroke of genius. Fans of Jackie Chan may be slightly disappointed by the lack of action set pieces that emphasize his kung-fu craft. On the other hand, those who know the history of this seasoned Hong Kong actor will be able to appreciate thatRush Hourwas the mainstream breakthrough that Chan had deserved for years. Coupled with the charismatic scene-stealer Tucker, Chan gets to flex his comic muscles to great effect. From their first scenes together to the trademark Chan outtakes during the end credits, their ability to play off of one another is a joy to behold, and this mischievous interaction is what saves the film from slipping into the depths of pitiful mediocrity.--Jeremy Storey", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CY5X", "B000059XYJ", "B00005JL8Y", "6302091632", "B00006G8LB", "B00000JGEK", "6300213730"], "bought_together": ["B00003CY5X"], "also_viewed": ["B00003CY5X", "B00005JL8Y", "B000WGYMTC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 400219}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0780623711", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514DYRWFBKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rush Hour [VHS]"}

{"description": "In the vastly overrated 1998 bookEasy Riders, Raging Bulls, author Peter Biskind puts the blame for Hollywood's blockbuster mentality at least partially on Steven Spielberg's box-office success with this adaptation of Peter Benchley's bestselling novel. But you can't blame Spielberg for making a terrific movie, whichJawsdefinitely is. The story of a Long Island town whose summer tourist business is suddenly threatened by great-white-shark attacks on humans bypasses the potboiler trappings of Benchley's book and goes straight for the jugular with beautifully crafted, crowd-pleasing sequences of action and suspense supported by a trio of terrific performances by Roy Scheider (as the local sheriff), Richard Dreyfuss (as a shark specialist), and particularly Robert Shaw (as the old fisherman who offers to hunt the shark down). The sequences on Shaw's boat--as the three of them realize that in fact the shark is huntingthem--are what entertaining moviemaking is all about.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005B6ND", "6300183181", "0784011923", "0767825411", "6305814694", "B00000JGEI", "6303148352", "6303506291", "630018403X", "B00000490M", "6300214753", "6304932553", "630442972X", "6300269639", "B0000048S1", "B000005PFL", "6302765536", "6302091632", "6302824729", "6303344224", "6301570723", "6300247171", "B00008WFU5", "6305576173", "6300183467", "0790743213", "6304143184", "6303402348", "1558808221", "6303020089", "B000063UUL", "B00005B238", "6303212379", "B00005A8XX", "0790731436", "0783226152", "0790705141", "6300267881", "B00008WFU4", "6300181340", "630157401X", "6302921058", "6300214060", "6302968143", "1558802258", "0792102320", "6300214087", "6300268993", "B0000BWVBD", "B002GHHHL0", "6301888901", "B00005JKDQ", "6303122647", "6302800420", "6303610811", "6301827732", "6303540082", "6302374189", "0800198395", "6300214435", "6304071876", "6301208773", "B00000IO4G", "B00006G8LB", "B0087ZG7HK", "B00008DZ83", "6300214710", "6300215814", "630220366X", "6304457324", "0800116917", "B000059XY5", "6303212263", "6300216500", "6303236863", "630533577X", "6300213986", "6302415853", "6304935811", "6302820448", "B00004U8P4", "6300214311", "6301798503", "0793927501", "6300214370", "6302787564", "6304288433", "6300182878", "B000003KHS", "6301971809", "B000007OY0", "0790734079", "630336568X", "0790733927", "0790742322", "6301966988", "0764006770", "B000059XVO", "B00023BLXA"], "also_viewed": ["B00008WFU5", "6301792734", "6305814694", "B00005B6ND", "0784011923", "0767825411", "6300214060", "6300183181", "6300247171", "B00005A8XX", "6303506291", "B00006AL1C", "0792151712", "6304539258", "630018403X", "6305363668", "B00008WFU4", "B00000JGEI", "B00078XGO2", "6304117752", "6301574117", "0800116917", "B000005PPB", "B0056BE0SG", "6302091632", "080010367X", "6304143184", "6300216845", "6304539274", "6303148352", "0792158261", "B00000JS61", "0792839846", "6303212379", "0792837614", "0783222955", "0783221347", "0790700506", "6302921058", "6301797906", "6301976983", "6305123616", "6303402070", "6304429274", "1558807780", "B00005JKDQ", "6300214370", "6302936381", "B00000JGEK", "B0000AQZYM", "B00000JXVM", "B0007KTBIU", "0790734079", "6304039522", "6300214753", "B00005NCCP", "B005FHWWXQ", "B0087F7VSY", "B00KDU8HQQ"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 177995}, "asin": "0783216084", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514JQY1K3TL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jaws [VHS]"}
{"description": "Although it wasn't a box-office success when originally released in 1958,Vertigohas since taken its deserved place as Alfred Hitchcock's greatest, most spellbinding, most deeply personal achievement. In fact, it consistently ranks among the top 10 movies ever made in the once-a-decadeSight & Soundinternational critics poll, placing at number 4 in the 1992 survey. (Universal Pictures' spectacularly gorgeous 1996 restoration and rerelease of this 1958 Paramount production was a tremendous success with the public, too.) James Stewart plays a retired police detective who is hired by an old friend to follow his wife (a superb Kim Novak, in what becomes a double role), whom he suspects of being possessed by the spirit of a dead madwoman. The detective and the disturbed woman fall (\"fall\" is indeed the operative word) in love and...well, to give away any more of the story would be criminal. Shot around San Francisco (the Golden Gate Bridge and the Palace of the Legion of Honor are significant locations) and elsewhere in Northern California (the redwoods, Mission San Juan Batista) in rapturous Technicolor,Vertigois as lovely as it is haunting.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300183513", "0783235593", "0790743213", "6300183580", "6300181340", "6300215741", "0783235607", "6304039530", "6305123616", "0783236352", "6301798503", "0792839846", "6302909023", "B0002IXSVI", "0782008348", "0800132009", "1558807780", "0783222955", "0800100832", "6304359705", "0790744589", "B0007939NO", "6305576173", "6301670159", "6301564456", "0800113055", "630150528X", "6301670140", "6301647734", "0783235623", "0792837614", "6304151306", "B00871C09S", "B000003KIU", "0792837649", "B00000J2KZ", "6301586042", "6300267938", "B000059HGY", "630281622X", "6302241103", "6303854311", "6304935811", "6300215512", "0792837630", "B0045HCJ9E", "0792107683", "0783235704", "6302641888", "0783235674", "630236325X", "B00000J2L7", "0783235615", "B00000K3AN", "B00005LMA7", "6300184919", "6301797973", "6300181367", "B00000FZXC", "6301798732", "0782006809", "B000005QWI", "0780614097", "630266232X", "B0000040EO", "630251018X", "6300208133", "6302278929", "B00000I1DI", "6301797906", "1558804226", "6300268594", "6305363668", "6300270386", "6303430546", "0800116917", "6304383177", "6302510007", "B000M7BEPQ", "B00003OSTO", "6301797957", "6301973410", "630442972X", "6301025083", "6304457316", "6304383169", "0792837096", "6304071876", "6302510031", "6300182304", "6302413435", "6302797667", "6302281849", "6301986059", "6301975987", "6304196954", "6300251152", "6300246965"], "bought_together": ["6300183513", "6300183580"], "also_viewed": ["0792839846", "6304429274", "6304117752", "0783222955", "6304539258", "0790743213", "6304457383", "6303215734", "0783216084", "B00BWJQEC6", "0800100832", "B00000K3AN", "0800132009", "6301792769", "6305123616", "6304039530", "6304151306"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 271884}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.43, "brand": "", "asin": "0783221088", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JF1C6DF5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Vertigo (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}
{"description": "Director Martin Scorsese reunites with members of hisGoodFellasgang (writer Nicholas Pileggi; actors Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Frank Vincent) for a three-hour epic about the rise and fall of mobster Sam &quot;Ace&quot; Rothstein (De Niro), a character based on real-life gangster Frank &quot;Lefty&quot; Rosenthal. (It's modeled after onWiseguyandGoodFellasand Pileggi's true crime bookCasino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas.)  Through Rothstein, the picture tells the story of how the Mafia seized, and finally lost control of, Las Vegas gambling. The first hour plays like a fascinating documentary, intricately detailing the inner workings of Vegas casinos. Sharon Stone is the stand out among the actors; she nabbed an Oscar nomination for her role as the voracious Ginger, the glitzy call girl who becomes Rothstein's wife. The film is not as fast paced or gripping as Scorsese's earlier gangster pictures (Mean StreetsandGoodFellas), but it's still absorbing.

Before ridding the showboat of the villains, Abbott and Costello perform several of their most famous bits, including the complete rendition of their hysterical \"Who's on First?\" routine, which has become one of the most popular comedy moments ever captured on film.", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303103804", "B0001FGBZM", "6302526078", "630214227X", "0783240546", "B000HWZ4CK", "B00004RFB1", "B004VULIWY", "6302526108", "6302142288", "6300181820", "630288473X", "6301977149", "0783240570", "630018191X", "6303158579", "0783240538", "6300182983", "6303103790", "6301374274", "6302884748", "6302884713", "6302526124", "6302884756", "6303103774", "6302884772", "0783240767", "6302526183", "6302641799"], "bought_together": ["6303103804"], "also_viewed": ["B0001FGBZM", "B001EXE2Y2", "6302142288", "0783240538", "6302884772"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 485657}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0783240554", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TPH0FFVPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Abbott &amp; Costello: Naughty Nineties [VHS]"}
{"description": "This is one of the best parodies of the '40s hardboiled detective genre,  with a very clever conceit: weaving the plot and production design around memorable movie clips (The Killers,The Big Sleep,Double  Indemnity,The Lost Weekend,White Heat,This Gun for Hire,Sorry, Wrong  Number,Notorious). Steve Martin plays the cool Rigby Reardon, who tries solving an incomprehensible mystery with the assistance of Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney, Burt Lancaster, Fred MacMurray, Ingrid Bergman, and Ray Milland, among others. It's all silly hokum with Rachel Ward as the pretty moll and director-cowriter Carl Reiner as the nefarious villain. Miklos Rozsa takes us back to yesteryear with his lush score, and, fittingly, Edith Head handles the period costumes in her final production.--Bill Desowitz", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005RDRO", "B003BZ58RQ", "B00005Q4D6", "B002T51X4Q", "B0002B15X8", "B00013WVL2", "B00005PJ6O", "B000LBL3TK", "B00347AILW", "0790742071", "B000G6BLWE", "B000035Z3C", "B0019HQICW", "B00004XPPK", "B00BTYFWEA", "B00AEFYO5I", "B000244F2S", "B0087ZG7OI", "B002Q3MYA8", "B00023P4II", "B00AEFY0KW", "B00012L786", "B000FFJYAW", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B000244EX8", "0767818105", "B00004W229", "B00D3LA6AW", "B00AEFYVUQ", "B00023P4GA", "B009X919UE", "B001TNGOY8", "B00005AUK9", "B00BGARG14", "B003ZEQMH8", "B00I9BU60Q", "B00005KH2F", "B0089BSMWA", "B00005V5NS", "B000B8384Q", "B00AEFXNXW", "6305428263", "B000H0JD88", "B0006Z2NE0", "B000FVQLKM", "B000H7JCFK", "B001Q8MMC4", "B00287Z18Y", "078322740X", "B0080JG2GE", "B004C2523M", "B000FFJYA2", "B000J9YKNU", "B002O3Z4YI", "B000A9QK7I", "B0049985XW", "B0028ZDJN0", "B00DBE97S8", "B00ICWO1LC", "B00AEFXDO6", "B000CNE088", "B0000D1FFU", "B0009ZE9N0", "B0001ZX0O2", "B0024FAG80", "B000BGH2NG", "B00005PJ6M", "B006QS9M1S", "B005ERX1UU", "B004ALIG0G", "0792844890", "B0053TWVLY", "B00I9BU49Y", "B000MQ54M6", "B00DL48BM6", "B000G6BLQU", "B00E18QKJ2", "B000PKG7CU", "B00008CMR1", "B00DOF9N42", "B0000648ZQ", "B000EXDSBQ", "B00005QBZL"], "bought_together": ["B00005RDRO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005RDRO", "B00005PJ6O", "B000BPL2GA", "B0089BSMWA"]}, "price": 7.86, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 41822}, "asin": "0783232063", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41T9KWAH8KL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid"}
{"description": "You have to hand it to the walking dead. What they lack in speed and agility, they more than make up for in sheer single-minded determination. Im-Ho-Tep is a case in point. He's an ancient Egyptian priest, cursed for his terrible crimes against the gods. A team of British archaeologists digs up his sarcophagus, along with a box inscribed with a warning that opening it will unleash death and destruction. You'll never guess what they do. Once freed, Im-Ho-Tep takes on the appropriately evil alias Ardath Bey and gets to the task of resurrecting his ancient lover--which will, of course, require a living human surrogate. While the premise may sound formulaic,The Mummyin fact turns out to be bracingly weird, relying on atmospheric creepiness rather than on jump-out-and-scare-you effects. Boris Karloff gives a terrific performance as Im-Ho-Tep. He has all the malevolence the film requires, but also manages subtler touches; the expression in his eyes as he is wrapped in preparation for being buried alive is absolutely chilling. Instead of forcing him to do all the tedious shambling around that so many mummies resort to, the filmmakers have wisely given Im-Ho-Tep/Ardath Bey a nearly living appearance once he's cleaned up and has a few psychic powers to boot, making him a potent adversary. Stock up on ace bandages and prepare for a good spooky evening.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300181278", "6300183092", "6300181286", "6302120101", "6300183629", "630252542X", "6300185281", "6302843219", "6300185443", "6301005783", "6302841771", "6302526175", "6303626424", "6302526167", "6302526086", "630018529X", "6302841763", "630252587X", "6302526140", "6302526051", "6302843227", "6301257014", "6302841844", "6302843200", "6302526191", "630284178X", "6300181820", "6302526094", "6303129153", "0783235607", "0790736055", "6301327845", "6303129188", "6301967410", "6302194296", "630312917X", "6303129145", "5554306004", "6303129161", "6304507348", "6302841798", "0792835077", "6300247589", "6302120527", "B00007JME0", "B000HDNPM0", "6300182983", "6302491975", "6302503493", "6302814669", "0800116917"], "bought_together": ["6300181278", "6300183092"], "also_viewed": ["6300183629", "6300181286", "6300181278", "6300183092", "6300185281", "6300181820", "630018529X", "6302841763", "6302526140", "6302841771", "630252542X", "6300185443", "6302843219", "6302526094", "6302120101", "6301005783", "630252587X", "6303129188", "6302526051"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 363783}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.47, "brand": "", "asin": "0783234287", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YBJJ5PEBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Mummy [VHS]"}

{"description": "Thanks in large part to its meticulous re-creation of the late-1960s and early-'70s rock scene and the uncannily authentic performance by Val Kilmer as legendary Doors frontman Jim Morrison, Oliver Stone's hypnotic film biography is standing the test of time. Capturing the carefree mood of the Age of Aquarius, the film charts the meteoric rise of the Doors on the California club circuit (including a memorable scene showing the creation of the hit &quot;Light My Fire&quot;), and chronicles the band's exploits with hallucinogenics and Morrison's battles against charges of public indecency on stage. Kilmer's performance is hauntingly perfect, and performances by Meg Ryan, Kathleen Quinlan, and Kyle MacLachlan are similarly impressive. The movie doesn't fully probe the depths of Morrison's character, but as a portrait of excess it is vividly true to the spirit of the self-destructive poet known to his fans as &quot;The Lizard King.&quot;--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003H5WF3U", "0783233485", "B0090O07S2", "B000LPS4L6", "B0006ZE7G2", "B0002CTSXQ", "B005DJ62MS", "B000UCEJDC", "B00FWSWIIM", "B00003CXWV", "0385304471", "0679734627", "0671210440", "B0074JODC6", "0446697338", "B000002HJD", "0783229526", "B003VC6F44", "B002SRHC5Y", "B002AF4Y9G", "0679726225", "B0015UKX74", "B0069GRIHW", "0425170454", "B00029RTAI", "B00004ZBVO", "B00069FKX2", "B004SIP95G", "B0013K1ALE", "B00005JM23", "079284646X", "B000MCIBE8", "B00005JND5", "B00AEFXE9U", "1932855742", "B000002H92", "B000P0J0D8", "B001NXDSLQ", "B000MCIBAW", "0792846435", "B00AEBB9IM", "B0044R7VCK", "B002GIBVVQ", "B000PAAJZ6", "B00005V9HB", "0688119158", "B00006L929", "B000ZM1MGE", "B000002HRA", "B006TTC5HC", "B002XTXGCK", "6305127646", "B0011U8NZ2", "0767805763", "0991252527", "0767812182", "B00029RTCG", "B004SIP9Z6", "B0002V7ON8", "B000NO39FG", "B0009E3234", "B000MCIBB6", "B003ELKNH2", "B00AEFYCL4", "6304711905", "1556525893", "B001MFNB58", "B0085A9HU6", "B0038Z5T4Q", "B004MC98VY", "B00000K3TX", "B004FQX5B6", "B000065U1Q", "B000AXWHSA", "0446602280", "B007NYZ9S4", "B004FQX59I", "B0052FG750", "B004P7CN5O", "B000E8QVWY", "B000CNESTE", "B0000VV508", "B0010DJ174", "B00000IQW4", "B00005JKM2", "0760706182", "B00AEFYW64", "B004SIP9MY", "B00005Q4CS", "B00004XPPB", "B002G1K82Q", "B000F5GNX8", "B000031EFY", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00KCWV6KO", "B00008975Z", "B0034G4P6W", "B00INLE5K4", "B003HKN52U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0090O07S2", "B003H5WF3U", "B000UCEJDC", "B00FWSWIIM"]}, "price": 7.36, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 118937}, "asin": "0784010528", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71RG0C6WQWL._SY300_.gif", "title": "The Doors"}

{"description": "Here's another gritty independent film that tries to invade Tarantino territory by casting Christopher Walken--that most reliable of indie-film actors--as a Mobster who gets chummy with a group of preppie-like young men and becomes the victim of a kidnapping scheme. One of the kidnappers (Henry Thomas) has a sister who's been abducted by another group of kidnappers, and they've bagged Walken for his Mob connections and negotiating power. What follows is a game of psychological strategy in which the desperate group of guys slowly lose their advantage to the smarter, more experienced gangster--even though they've got Walken tied to a chair. The situation turns volatile when the young men start to doubt the wisdom of their strategy and suspect betrayal within the group, andSuicide Kingsturns into a talky, repetitious thriller only partially redeemed by Denis Leary's cagey role as Walken's Mob lieutenant. The movie's a showcase for its cast of rising talent (including Jay Mohr, Jeremy Sisto, Johnny Galecki, and Sean Patrick Flanery), but not even Walken can hold it all together. What's best about the film is Leary's sinister presence in a peripheral role and Walken's trademark villainy, here toned down to a steady, simmering menace.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001FGBUW", "B00000IQC9", "B002NO4ISG", "B00004ZBVF", "B0002I84EE", "B00007ELER", "B00008977D", "B0006Q94A0", "B000P0J0D8", "B007REV4LQ", "B002TZS57E", "B000Q66QG0", "B00382S9MS", "B004UVYQYQ", "B000UO4F7U", "B00005QJHP", "B0000A2ZTZ", "B005JJCMOO", "B000N8UXU6", "B00AEFXR8I", "B00005V9HQ", "B00005Q4CT", "B002665I8K", "B00062IESC", "B00011CZRE", "B000AGTPTG", "B0006N2DS8", "B00BLF9FYA", "B00008R9M3", "B000UNYK44", "B000GGSMC6", "B00682LSNM", "B00008RH3L", "B000CEXF5Q", "6305327041", "B000IY04Q8", "B00007E8UI", "B00004ZETA", "B004LS6CN6", "B000093FLA", "B00J5G1P2W", "6305313687", "B004U7MR14", "B002AF4Y9G", "B000CNESTE", "B0000AMJEK", "B0029EW7BA", "B009Z3PX0U", "B0012IX35I", "B006TTC5HC", "B004SIP95G", "B000F5GNX8", "B0009A40EI", "B00FGVS0D2", "B005YCEI9S", "B000063K1A", "B006TTC5DQ", "B0006BGXP4", "B00008975Z", "1594742596", "B000067J1O", "0767802519", "0783117140", "B000XPU66U", "B00000IRE6", "B00GS08Y3Q", "B00004YA67", "B00AEBBA4K", "B004CWLRF4", "B00000JNBX", "0792845811", "B004FQX5B6", "B00C2CDJ34", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000UR9QXK", "B0001US7CC", "B008M6MG42", "B000FIMG7C", "0780631536", "B0009U7LOO", "B00005V9HH", "630542845X", "B00003CY1G", "B0012EM5CY", "B00C3JUJJS", "B002ZG99H2", "B0007WFXLW", "B00D9EJGAY", "B002ZG99N6", "B000P0J09M", "B0000DBJ2D", "B000069I1H", "0767818024", "076785344X", "B000W4TGIQ", "B0057ZAA6W", "B000VDDDVE", "B00CX7TOOG", "B00007LB4C", "B000GI3KGC"], "bought_together": ["B0001FGBUW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001FGBUW", "B007REV4LQ", "B000P0J0AG", "B0006Q94A0"]}, "price": 9.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 211655}, "asin": "0784011516", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DP0899DFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Suicide Kings"}

{"description": "The three-day Woodstock music festival in 1969 was the pivotalevent of the 1960s peace movement, and this landmark concert film is the definitive record of that milestone of rock & roll history.  It's more than a chronicle of the hippie movement, however; this is a film of genuine historical and social importance, capturing the spirit of America in transition, when the Vietnam War was at its peak and antiwar protest was fully expressed through the liberating music of the time. With a brilliant crew at his disposal (including a young editor named Martin Scorsese), director Michael Wadleigh worked with over 300 hours of footage to create his original 225-minute director's cut, which was cut by 40 minutes for the film's release in 1970. Eight previously edited segments were restored in 1994, and the original director's cut of Woodstock is now the version most commonly available on videotape and DVD.The film deservedly won the Academy Award for Best Documentary, and it's still a stunning achievement.  Abundant footage taken among the massive crowd (\"half a million strong\") expresses the human heart of the event, from skinny-dipping hippies to accidental overdoses, to unpredictable weather, midconcert childbirth, and the thoughtful (or just plain rambling) reflections of the festive participants. Then, of course, there is the music--a nonstop parade of rock & roll from the greatest performers of the period, including Crosby, Stills, and Nash, Canned Heat, The Who, Richie Havens, Joan Baez, Ten Years After, Sly & The Family Stone, Santana, and many more. Watching this ambitious film, as the saying goes, is the next best thing to being there--it's a time-travel journey to that once-in-a-lifetime event.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00274SHKM", "B00006JU7P", "B001TLWR46", "B00004YZFR", "B002SQ364Q", "B000E5LEWE", "B00003CXB1", "B0013K1ALE", "B00274SHKC", "B0009PBLZE", "B003NOGNX8", "B00DSS7B0S", "B002IZ1RMU", "0783233485", "1573306932", "B003VRV9FY", "B0084NZEWO", "B000AM6N9U", "B0002234XQ", "B000B8IANU", "B000OCY668", "B000AYQJ3I", "B0000CEB4V", "B0014DZ2XC", "B00L47E6IA", "B008PALH1I", "B001FWRZ14", "630463949X", "B000621484", "B002E01M9C", "B005IT63GI", "B001XJEKGC", "B000KJU1HI", "B001V7P2MM", "B00F031WB8", "B0090O07S2", "B0002WZTJI", "B00HQI823Q", "B00KF1CWF0", "B0028LN3AS", "B0019Y1I4S", "B00007LTIL", "B000A0GP4K", "B000654YR4", "B00005NB8K", "B000BTC5LW", "B00H3JHH6Q", "B000305ZDO", "B00003OSU4", "B0006ZE7G2", "B000VI6T6U", "B0002Z9HT8", "B0085KGHI6", "B00000K3TV", "B000MWKCFO", "B003DC8D7Y", "B001NHZ2KM", "B000BM7U82", "B0030ATZIA", "B009186JYI", "0060755229", "B00IPL286U", "B00008PX8P", "B000022TSY", "B0052Y0FJ0", "B005HI4LLO", "B0000DJZ81", "B00008J2HC", "B00008GKEG", "B00ARX2W9C", "B001FWRZ0U", "B0000062FJ", "B00092ZMDY", "B0009E3234", "B0002GTX8C", "B000021Y7X", "B002IR3PSC", "B0002V7ON8", "B000SQD13E", "B003152Z4K", "6305076995", "B00AU15GLC", "B000001DUP", "6305747172", "B0007Z0VVQ", "B00AKRQJOO", "B00004W50T", "6305019681", "B00JZO33VK", "6305610460", "B00KCUGSTA", "B0000584ZV", "B00B08FLVO", "B003ELKNH2", "B003H5WF3U", "B00004XMSE", "0811848248", "B0007GADZE", "B0000DBJDM"], "bought_together": ["B00274SHKM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00274SHKM", "B001V7P2MC", "B00DSS7B0S", "B00274SHKC"]}, "price": 47.85, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 129421}, "asin": "0790729350", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61CHJRGEDWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Woodstock - 3 Days of Peace &amp; Music (The Director's Cut)"}
{"description": "Stanley Kubrick'sThe Shiningis less an adaptation of Stephen King's bestselling horror novel than a complete reimagining of it from the inside out. In King's book, the Overlook Hotel is a haunted place that takes possession of its off-season caretaker and provokes him to murderous rage against his wife and young son. Kubrick's movie is an existential Road Runner cartoon (his steadicam scurrying through the hotel's labyrinthine hallways), in which the cavernously empty spaces inside the Overlook mirror the emptiness in the soul of the blocked writer, who's settled in for a long winter's hibernation. As many have pointed out, King's protagonist goes mad, but Kubrick's Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is Looney Tunes from the moment we meet him--all arching eyebrows and mischievous grin. (Both Nicholson and Shelley Duvall reach new levels of hysteria in their performances, driven to extremes by the director's fanatical demands for take after take after take.)The Shiningis terrifying--but not in the way fans of the novel might expect. When it was redone as a TV miniseries (reportedly because of King's dissatisfaction with the Kubrick film), the famous topiary-animal attack (which was deemed impossible to film in 1980) was there--but the deeper horror was lost. Kubrick'sThe Shininggets under your skin and chills your bones; it stays with you, inhabits you, haunts you. And there's no place to hide...--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300267881", "0790734079", "B00005ATQA", "6302038308", "6300182770", "B0009RRUKW", "0783235607", "0783228317", "B00000J2KZ", "B00004RNAC", "0790736039", "B00023NRSM", "6304508611", "6300182878", "6302921058", "6304509154", "0783216084", "6300214087", "B00004W5UA", "6301427076", "630268644X", "B000003KHS", "B000AMW2TK", "0790700506", "6300181340", "6300214753", "6302054982", "0784011923", "6305363668", "6303686796", "6305095566", "630021639X", "6302822688", "6305576173", "0783246641", "6304994540", "6303953425", "B00004U8PA", "0792158261", "0792100085", "6300213986", "6300189015", "630533577X", "6300214826", "0792846303", "6304288433", "6300147630", "0792842111", "B000007OY0", "0790741512", "6302158176", "0792846311", "6300183416", "0800103106", "B000005PFL", "6300183211", "0790733927", "6301666569", "6301871952", "0767825411", "630339406X", "6303109950", "6300216500", "6300214192", "6300262731", "6303257674", "6304214502", "630018627X", "6300214311", "1558807381", "0792839234", "0767819187", "B00005B238", "0790731975", "6303579388", "B000059HFB", "6302798450", "B00000FZCU", "6303651461", "6303566391", "6302642175", "6301971582", "6300218058", "6301094352", "6300184064", "6300181278", "6304457383", "6300214672", "6300262855", "0800125762", "6303257305"], "bought_together": ["0790734079"], "also_viewed": ["6300147630", "6300182878", "B00005ATQA", "6300189015", "6300267881", "B00023NRSM", "6300213005", "6303953425", "0307743659", "6303148352", "0790734079", "B001AQT0Z4", "6300183211", "0784011923", "B00BBND56G", "0788806270"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 268792}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0790705141", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5106FV0S4PL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Shining [VHS]"}
{"description": "The most viscerally frightening and disturbing homicidal-maniac picture sinceThe Silence of the Lambs,Sevenis based on an idea that's both gruesome and ingenious. A serial killer forces each of his victims to die by acting out one of the seven deadly sins. The murder scene is then artfully arranged into a grotesque tableau, a graphic illustration of each mortal vice. From the jittery opening credits to the horrifying (and seemingly inescapable) concluding twist, director David Fincher immerses us in a murky urban twilight where everything seems to be rotting, rusting, or molding; the air is cold and heavy with dread. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are the detectives who skillfully track down the killer--all the while unaware that he has been closing in on them, as well. Gwyneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey are also featured, but it is director Fincher and the ominous, overwhelmingly oppressive atmosphere of doom that he creates that are the real stars of the film. It's a terrific date movie--for vampires.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005V9HH", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000M341QE", "0783240295", "B00003CXZ4", "6305313687", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000P0J0EW", "B000LP6KNU", "B000P0J09M", "B000P0J0AG", "B000069HZP", "B004SIP95G", "B0009A40ES", "B0007PALZ2", "B002NZK5RI", "B002AF4Y9G", "B00AEBB89W", "B004SIP7VM", "B00AEFXQ9S", "B00004BZIY", "B003ASLJO0", "B00003CXWV", "B00096S49Y", "B00AEFYF2K", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00008975Z", "B002T9H2LA", "B00005JLKN", "B000LC55F2", "0767802519", "B004FQX5B6", "B002VWNIEA", "B004SIP7TE", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00AEFXEGS", "0792846435", "B00003CXSP", "B002VWNICC", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000C20VPA", "B00AEFXESQ", "B000P0J0EM", "B000093FLA", "B002ZG99N6", "B002NZK5VO", "B003LR5BD0", "B002VWNIDG", "B000I2J736", "B0001FR3IQ", "B00AEFYYH6", "B000F5GNX8", "B002ZG980U", "B00005JN0W", "B00005JMJG", "B0000AC8LR", "B003ASLJQI", "B000E5N684", "B002XMGGK6", "B003HKN52U", "B00AP2DC94", "B00001ZWUS", "B000A2UBN4", "B000244GCW", "B000A7DVR2", "B002GHHHN8", "B00004WG2F", "B00AEFXKUI", "B001R3YRG2", "B002NZK5UU", "B00004XPPG", "B0034G4P7G", "B000FKO5QK", "B0009MDPYM", "B000NVT0SO", "B003ASLJQS", "B00005JPD0", "B00005JKWX", "B000YAF4MA", "B00005JKIS", "6305065551", "0783229526", "0783233477", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00005JA8B", "B00AEFXYJA", "B0000YEEGM", "B007D5E7C2", "B0002V7ON8", "B000N6U0E2", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00AEBB8LA", "6305718954", "B002AT8K9W", "B00AMSLDTM", "B000FS9FCG"], "bought_together": ["B0007DFJ0G", "6305313687"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004LWZW4M", "B00005V9HH", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000P0J0EW"]}, "price": 13.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 172718}, "asin": "0790729989", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VQ890AJML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Seven (Widescreen)"}
{"description": "One of the key movies of the 1970s, when exciting, groundbreaking, personal films were still being made in Hollywood, Milos Forman'sOne Flew over the Cuckoo's Nestemphasized the humanistic story at the heart of Ken Kesey's more hallucinogenic novel. Jack Nicholson was born to play the part of Randle Patrick McMurphy, the rebellious inmate of a psychiatric hospital who fights back against the authorities' cold attitudes of institutional superiority, as personified by Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). It's the classic antiestablishment tale of one man asserting his individuality in the face of a repressive, conformist system--and it works on every level. Forman populates his film with memorably eccentric faces, and gets such freshly detailed and spontaneous work from his ensemble that the picture sometimes feels like a documentary. Unlike a lot of films pitched at the &quot;youth culture&quot; of the 1970s,One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nestreally hasn't dated a bit, because the qualities of human nature that Forman captures--playfulness, courage, inspiration, pride, stubbornness--are universal and timeless. The film swept the Academy Awards for 1976, winning in all the major categories (picture, director, actor, actress, screenplay) for the first time since Frank Capra'sIt Happened One Nightin 1931.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002VWNIDG", "B000RTB0R6", "B006TTC5HC", "B000FVQLQQ", "B000P0J0EW", "0767830555", "B0043X1FL8", "B00003CWQR", "B004SIP7ZS", "B003ELKNH2", "B0006GAOJA", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFXN9G", "0767811100", "0792833287", "B004SIP95G", "B0000YEEGM", "B00079Z9VO", "0451163966", "B00AEFYSWM", "B000P0J09M", "B008MIMWP8", "B000EHQU0S", "B006FE83UE", "B000M341QE", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00002VWE0", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002VWNIAY", "B00009W5CA", "0764586629", "B000ZM1MGE", "B00011CZRE", "B000P0J09C", "B0008ENHUI", "B00005V9HH", "B0019L770A", "B0019L21GA", "B00AEBB9CS", "B0050FXDDQ", "B000CNESTE", "B0006GANN2", "B000LP6KNU", "B000P0J0EM", "B00000IQV7", "B000055Y0X", "B00001ZWUS", "079073219X", "B0019UGYK0", "079284646X", "B00AEBB9F0", "B003ASLJO0", "B000A7DVR2", "B00AEBB9FA", "B0002B15ZG", "B004U7MR3M", "B000YAF4MA", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00066FBQG", "B00005JKIS", "6305144168", "B004SIP7TE", "B002ZG980U", "B00005ATQB", "B0045HCJ94", "0783229526", "B000A3XY5A", "B000093FLA", "B00026ZD04", "B004L9GMBC", "B0000DI87S", "B00006RCO1", "B0007PALZ2", "B0000JBALO", "B004IFYMYI", "B007N31YH0", "B000P0J0D8", "B000H4JH7Q", "B00B0U2SFE", "0792846443", "B007D0FVRM", "B000022TSY", "B0087ZG7UW", "B0002234LS", "B0045HCJ9E", "B0000A02TZ", "B001GD6VTE", "B00AEFYRP0", "0784011710", "B00009AOAZ", "B00005JLSB", "B000Q678OO", "0792838408", "6305882592", "B003LMPKSQ", "B00005MEOU", "B00AEFYSL8", "B0057ZAA6W", "B001AEF6BI", "B000HC2LHG"], "bought_together": ["B002VWNIDG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000P0J0EW", "0451163966", "B006TTC5HC", "B00AEFY0F2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 40218}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.24, "brand": "WARNER STUDIOS", "asin": "0790732181", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pJoIlXFbL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"}

{"description": "In a time when it seems that every other movie makes some claim to being a film noir,L.A. Confidentialis the real thing--a gritty, sordid tale of sex, scandal, betrayal, and corruption of all sorts (police, political, press--and, of course, very personal) in 1940s Hollywood. The Oscar-winning screenplay is actually based on several titles in James Ellroy's series of chronological thriller novels (including the title volume,The Big Nowhere, andWhite Jazz)--a compelling blend of L.A. history and pulp fiction that has earned it comparisons to the greatest of all Technicolor noir films,Chinatown. Kim Basinger richly deserved her Supporting Actress Oscar for her portrayal of a conflicted femme fatale; unfortunately, her male costars are so uniformly fine that they may have canceled each other out with the Academy voters: Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kevin Spacey, and James Cromwell play LAPD officers of varying stripes. Pearce's character is a particularly intriguing study in Hollywood amorality and ambition, a strait-laced &quot;hero&quot; (and son of a departmental legend) whose career goals outweigh all other moral, ethical, and legal considerations.

Morpheus awakens Neo to the real world, a ravaged wasteland where most of humanity have been captured by a race of machines that live off of the humans' body heat and electrochemical energy and who imprison their minds within an artificial reality known as the Matrix.

{"description": "The first, and only, X-rated film to win a best picture Academy Award, John Schlesinger'sMidnight Cowboyseems a lot less daring today (and has been reclassified as an R), but remains a fascinating time capsule of late-1960s sexual decadence in mainstream American cinema. In a career-making performance, Jon Voight plays Joe Buck, a naive Texas dishwasher who goes to the big city (New York) to make his fortune as a sexual hustler. Although enthusiastic about selling himself to rich ladies for stud services, he quickly finds it hard to make a living and eventually crashes in a seedy dump with a crippled petty thief named Ratzo Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman, doing one of his more effective &quot;stupid acting tricks,&quot; with a limp and a high-pitch rasp of a voice). Schlesinger's quick-cut, semi-psychedelic style has dated severely, as has his ruthlessly cynical approach to almost everybody but the lead characters. But at its heart the movie is a sad tale of friendship between a couple of losers lost in the big city, and with an ending no studio would approve today. It's a bit like an urbanOf Mice and Men, but where both guys are Lenny.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00079Z9VO", "0767830555", "B0006GANN2", "B000XJD34I", "B000022TSY", "B000RTB0R6", "B006TTC5HC", "B0010AN7Z4", "B0006GAOJA", "B004FQX5B6", "B00003CXBU", "6304907729", "B00005MEOU", "B00005M2CO", "B00AEFXN9G", "B0000549B1", "B0008ENHUI", "B0009S4IKQ", "B00005JKF6", "B003ELKNH2", "B000CNESTE", "B000ZM1MG4", "B00005AUKE", "B000BYA4HE", "B00006RCO2", "B00004XPPC", "B0006HBV3W", "B00011D1OK", "B00066FBQG", "B0002KPHZG", "B000BITV92", "B0010YVCI4", "B00AEFYSWM", "B000CEXEWA", "B000LPR6GA", "B0000YEEGM", "B00003CXB5", "B0001US8F8", "B000ZM1MGE", "0780021312", "B000CNESU8", "B0050FXDDQ", "B001EOQCMG", "B00006RCO1", "B00AATV07S", "B00782O7IY", "B00004TVUD", "B002VWNIBI", "0767827902", "076781326X", "B0049985XW", "0783240171", "B00012FXJ0", "B0087ZG7OI", "B0019L21GA", "B001GUYAZY", "6305918880", "B000EHSVS2", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B00000DQWS", "B00011D1OU", "B00002VWE0", "B00006RCO3", "B004SIP7F8", "B00AEFY6DI", "6304712936", "B003INBNOS", "B00AEBB95K", "B004L9GMBC", "079284646X", "B00AEBB9FA", "B003ZEQMH8", "B00AEBB89C", "B000LP6KNU", "B0019UGYK0", "B001D8W7EU", "B006FE83UE", "B000KJTGHO", "0792846109", "B0088XQBXQ", "B0087ZG7R0", "B007N31YH0", "B003O7I6SE", "B00AEFZDNA", "B000055Y0X", "B0019L770A", "B003LMPKSQ", "B000UJ48SQ", "B009NYF2GQ", "B000KX0IOA", "B004SIP9U6", "B00006ADD5", "B0045HCJTO", "0792838408", "B0045HCJ94", "B0045HCJ8U", "B000P0J09M", "B002VWNIAY", "B00008RH3J", "B005KQVE1S"], "bought_together": ["B00079Z9VO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004FQX5B6", "B006TTC5HC", "B0006GANN2", "B0000YEEGM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 4113}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "MGM", "asin": "0792833287", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C3ME80X6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Midnight Cowboy"}

{"description": "The 18th James Bond adventure was a runaway box-office success when released in 1995, thanks to the arrival of Pierce Brosnan as the fifth actor (following the departure of Timothy Dalton) to play the suave, danger-loving Agent 007. This James Bond is a bit more vulnerable and psychologically complex--and just a shade more politically correct--but he's still a formally attired playboy at heart, with a lovely Russian beauty (Izabella Scorupco) as his sexy ally against a cadre of renegade Russians bent on--what else?--global domination. There's also a seductive villainous with the suggestive name of Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen), and the great actress Judi Dench makes her first appearance as Bond's superior, M, who wisecracks about 007's &quot;dinosaur&quot; status as a globetrotting sexist. All in all, this action-packed Bond adventure provided a much-needed boost the long-running movie series, revitalizing the 007 franchise for the turn of the millennium.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000RPCK1U", "B000NIBURQ", "B001EDVNNU", "B000NDEXPM", "B000M53GMW", "B000RPCK24", "B000RPCK1K", "B000RPCK1A", "B001R10BN2", "B000NIBURG", "B000NIBUR6", "B000M53GN6", "B000M53GLS", "B000NIBUS0", "B000M53GNG", "B000RPCK0Q", "B000NDEXPC", "B000M53GMC", "B00AQSN7HE", "B001PPLIEG", "B00004RG62", "B00004WEJZ", "B007REV4T8", "B00005JL0I", "B008YAPQX4", "B009PN18R2", "B009PN3OD8", "B004BR7XLM", "B00AZFECL8", "0767803434", "6305657947", "B0014Z4ON4", "B004P7CN3G", "B0000BYRO9", "B000SK5Z70", "B000EGDB10", "B00005N5S5", "B000ENC5YW", "B002GHHHME", "B00008K76U", "B00000JQB5", "B000RW3VCK", "B00AEFXKUI", "B0002S94CK", "B0014C2FX8", "B000JYW5BE", "B004LWZW6K", "B0015XHQT4", "B008YAPRBU", "B000ARXF96", "B0014Z4OMU", "6305133476", "B000N3SSBW", "B00026ZG10", "B0000VD12I", "B003XURDAY", "B0046MOVE4", "B00005A3KS", "B0002I84N0", "B000WP07F6", "B0007KZQAM", "0783225547", "B00000BLFI", "B00AEFYBA6", "B00005PJ8S", "B00AVWIQZS", "B00003CXC5", "B00011CZRE", "B00008G8M4", "B004EPYZUS", "B004IK30MI", "079284646X", "B00595W3QK", "B00AEBB8VK", "B00000G3PA", "B000FO0AA6", "B00AEFYDM2", "B008JFUS0U", "B006TTC5WC", "B00008K76W", "B0000BYRO7", "B001FB55HQ", "B000EHSVSC", "B0036TGSR6", "B00EALTW3G", "B002I9Z8BM", "B002GOAH1A", "B00096S4BM", "6304765258", "6304698801", "B000AP04FG", "B00407PNWO", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00005JN2Z", "0790729997", "B00GHH9GXC", "B002ZG98LO", "B000HRMAPE", "0783226012"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000M53GN6", "B000RPCK0Q", "B00I9TDMCM", "B001R10BN2"]}, "price": 12.49, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 255435}, "asin": "079283318X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DZYMD2RDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "GoldenEye (Special Edition)"}
{"description": "Maybe \"nobody's perfect,\" as one character in this masterpiece suggests. But some movies are perfect, andSome Like It Hotis one of them. In Chicago, during the Prohibition era, two skirt-chasing musicians, Joe and Jerry (Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon), inadvertently witness the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. In order to escape the wrath of gangland chief Spats Colombo (George Raft), the boys, in drag, join an all-woman band headed for Florida. They vie for the attention of the lead singer, Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe), a much-disappointed songbird who warbles \"I'm Through with Love\" but remains vulnerable to yet another unreliable saxophone player. (When Curtis courts her without his dress, he adopts the voice of Cary Grant--a spot-on impersonation.) The script by director Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond is beautifully measured; everything works, like a flawless clock. Aspiring screenwriters would be well advised to throw away the how-to books and simply study this film. The bulk of the slapstick is handled by an unhinged Lemmon and the razor-sharp Joe E. Brown, who plays a horny retiree smitten by Jerry's feminine charms. For all the gags, the film is also wonderfully romantic, as Wilder indulges in just the right amounts of moonlight and the lilting melody of \"Park Avenue Fantasy.\"Some Like It Hotis so delightfully fizzy, it's hard to believe the shooting of the film was a headache, with an unhappy Monroe on her worst behavior. The results, however, are sublime.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302484383", "0790743213", "6302484405", "0792839846", "6303402070", "6302484391", "1558807780", "6301586026", "630233683X", "6303444202", "6304039506", "6300267865", "B000059GEE", "6302484421", "0790744759", "6300215814", "B00000F13T", "6304151306", "0792837630", "630150528X", "6301734734", "B0000068ZQ", "6301964012", "630197736X", "6302413435", "B000PYKZYC", "630018627X", "B00004RV8M", "0800100832", "6300183513", "6300181340", "6301963911", "6300246868", "0792840836", "6301798503", "6300251012", "B00000F6O0", "6301967410", "6301965701", "6300215717", "0783221347", "6300269256", "6301978110", "6300216233", "6304056877", "6302909023", "630347327X", "B00005OLY5", "630248443X", "6301797957", "6302305950", "0782008348", "0783235607", "6300215598", "0792840844", "630197705X", "0783235593", "6302801133", "0783236352", "B00005A1VH", "6300181820"], "bought_together": ["0790743213"], "also_viewed": ["6301792769", "B000E39M20", "1558807780", "6303402070", "6305123616", "630233683X", "6302484383", "0783222955"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 258664}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0792837096", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51M3WF4F9JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Some Like It Hot [VHS]"}
{"description": "Bernardo Bertolucci's controversial 1973 film stars Marlon Brando as an expatriate American in Paris reeling from his wife's suicide and entering into a nihilistic sexual relationship with a young woman (Maria Schneider). The film is still shocking, not simply because of its (sometime unconventional) sexual sequences, but because Brando's protagonist needs his liaison with Schneider's character to remain anonymous, an experience not to be shared but indulged on either end. Bertolucci is also operating on subtext here: in a way, Brando's nonengaging engagement is a metaphor for a certain attitude toward directing movies.

{"description": "The first feature film to be photographed and projected in the panoramic three-camera Cinerama process, this epic Western is almost as expansive as the West itself, chronicling a pioneering family's triumphs and tragedies in numerous episodes spanning three generations and a half century of westward movement. Divided into five segments directed by veteran Hollywood filmmakers Henry Hathaway, George Marshall, and the legendary John Ford (and including uncredited sequences directed by Richard Thorpe), the film was one of the most ambitious ever made by the venerable MGM studio. Its stellar cast reads like a virtual who's who of Hollywood's biggest stars. Debbie Reynolds plays a sturdy survivor of many pioneering dangers, and the eventual widow of a gambler (Gregory Peck), who is later reunited with her nephew (George Peppard), a Civil War veteran and cavalryman who heads for San Francisco as the transcontinental railroad is being built. Many more characters and stories are woven throughout this epic film, which is dramatically uneven but totally engrossing with its stunning vistas and countless outdoor locations in Illinois, Kentucky, South Dakota, Monument Valley in Arizona, California, Colorado, and elsewhere.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008CMT3", "B000056H2H", "B00E3QJ8DC", "B006VRRGOO", "B00AEFXUL2", "6304696612", "B00009AVA5", "B000O599Y4", "B00BXTDVEO", "B000O59A0C", "B00AEFYL6K", "B000O599ZS", "B0082LUFA4", "0783228031", "B000O77LY2", "B000O599NK", "078322592X", "B00393SG0G", "B0045HCJSK", "B000ANVPP6", "B000OT6V0U", "B00BGQ2P9G", "B00008CMR6", "B000FTCLQC", "B000O599YE", "B00008MTW5", "B0009ML2KQ", "B00AEFYPHA", "B00AEBB8YM", "B00AEBB932", "B000O599YY", "B005GZ2CWS", "B00008MTW6", "B000ANVPPQ", "B009YX8MSG", "B000G6N0HI", "B007Y1NR1W", "B000BT96DW", "B00J9BZ4KC", "B00BAXTY7G", "B00004TJQK", "B00004ZBVE", "B00AMDA2OY", "B00004XMV9", "B000O599NA", "B00E4DJK78", "B00BFWKE62", "B0007US7FI", "B000O599WQ", "0783230478", "B000O599VM", "B000059TFU", "B000NQRR34", "B00AEFYBA6", "B0009ML2JC", "B00008MTW7", "B00AEFY6ZQ", "B00C3ALLPS", "B000056H2E", "B000QRI1GW", "B000031EGW", "B000O599ZI", "B00IU6HPIQ", "B000N3T0GY", "B000O599YO", "B003ASLJRC", "B003NF97MQ", "B00FNR9YY8", "B00005PJ8S", "0792838408", "B0001Z3I0I", "B00A92MCNW", "B0007PALM0", "B00AEFXSVE", "B005AMJ38S", "B000BPL2FG", "B009INAI02", "B0014BJ1A4", "B00CFHEE08", "B00005ASGH", "B0007MANZI", "B001B187NO", "B00132D7Y0", "B004GSVX8A", "B0007MANYY", "B004DY1VIO", "B0009X75WE", "B001D7T6BI"], "bought_together": ["B00008CMT3", "B000056H2H"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BXTDVEO", "B00J9BZ4KC", "B000056H2H", "B00IU6HPIQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 315351}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 30.49, "brand": "", "asin": "0792839072", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61HH9Y5XTJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "How the West Was Won"}
{"description": "After the cultish success ofRepo Man, maverick director Alex Cox made the film that remains his masterpiece--a loud, brash, abrasive, painful, funny, and utterly brilliant screen biography of British punk rocker Sid Vicious and his American girlfriend Nancy Spungen. As played to perfection by Gary Oldman and Chloe Webb, Sid and Nancy are made for each other, serving their mutual strengths and weaknesses and rising with the punk-rock fame of Sid's group, the Sex Pistols, while falling into the ultimately lethal pit of drug abuse. Cox doesn't pull any punches or compromise the unsavory aspects of this passionate love story, so the film presents a harsh mix of emotional and physical anguish tempered by the very poignant and genuine love shared by its tormented central characters. Through it all, the film emerges as an intimate and yet oddly epic chronicle of punk's glory days of anarchic sex, drugs and rock & roll. It's as dynamic and confidently directed as any screen biography before or since, no less fascinating for its unpleasant aspects as for the touching emotions at its very human core.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000065RCD"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 434106}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.09, "brand": "", "asin": "0792839641", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y5PCBCMSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sid &amp; Nancy [VHS]"}

{"description": "InThe Bad and the Beautiful, Kirk Douglas plays a tyrannical, manipulative producer fallen on hard times. To get back on his feet, he asks for help from three Hollywood giants whose careers he helped launch--a director (Barry Sullivan), an actress (Lana Turner), and a writer (Dick Powell). Unfortunately, they all hate him. Flashbacks explain why. Douglas had been close to all three at different points in his career: He and the director started out together making B-movies, he gave the wayward actress her first starring role, he turned the novelist into a successful screenwriter.  Then in one way or another he stabbed each of them in the back, though not always deliberately.

Boasting breathtaking performances, unforgettable imagery and two Oscar&#xC2;(r) nominations*, this astounding wartime spectacle is  mesmerizing...it will rivet you and shock you  (Jeffrey Lyons, 'sneak Previews ).  In 1930s Britain, a savage, civil war between two royal families has just concluded. But even as the newly installed King Edward (John Wood) takes the reins of power, his ruthless, younger brother Richard (Ian McKellen) sets in motion a monstrous scheme to claim the crown for himself. Enlisting the aid of equally duplicitous allies in the court, Richard embarks on a merciless, single-minded campaign of betrayal, seduction and cold-blooded murder to achieve the goal that has obsessed him all of his tortured life: to beking...at any price.  *1995: Costume Design, Art Direction", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00B2BYY1W", "B0059XTUR2", "B00443FMKM", "B000E6ESKS", "B001TR4G6W", "B004M9ZI0M", "079284615X", "B00005JLCI", "B0007WRT4Q", "B0002TVWYW", "B004SIP83Y", "B0000714BZ", "B00B6OEEKQ", "B00CDV4JNS", "B00J379KKW", "6305622876", "B00005S872", "B0006OR0YY", "B00DQN6IOK", "B000063JZQ", "B00063MC1Q", "B008H6GHE2", "1411401026", "B00000JL7T", "B00A7OBIGO", "B0038RSJ0U", "B000QGE8IS", "B000HWZ4AC", "B00019072G", "B007RP4CAA", "B00ECR7KX2", "B000FILVO6", "B00B2BYY30", "B000BP86VE", "B001LPWGHS", "B002SF9YMU", "B007RP4BZ6", "B008D1A18E", "0769712231", "B00AMEZDPG", "B000K7VHLY", "B0002CHIVK", "B000A9QK50", "B00IBKXSB4", "B003H0ZGWW", "B003TRS8XM", "0393929590", "B000Q7ZNDG", "0780021312", "B00AJER4EM", "B0013D8LWC", "B00AZFECHW", "B00005JH9F", "B007JVSRKS", "B000ALAT64", "B0012EM5CE", "B007I1Q50S", "B00G4TWDJ2", "B0002235QM", "B00B1E6EAY", "B007CJL17S", "B0059XTUT0", "B001O7R75O", "0780021320", "B00J379KHA", "B001G79Q60", "0743482840", "B005COLEOA", "B003Y5H5JM", "B00004Z4WW", "B001RUALEC", "B00080ZGHO", "1903436893", "B004H0M31I", "B007H7OQW2", "B000777I88", "B0000APNTV", "B007LNBSU0", "B000QGE8JC", "B0041ONFCQ", "B000092T3P", "B004P29LDG", "0822000717", "B000B8QF0U", "B002E01MBA", "B0079K4YL0", "B00HC224SU", "B000929ARI", "B004SIP9U6", "B00006FXDE", "1439172250", "B0088XQDD4", "0385722141", "0226300412", "B000PEKX62", "B00IBIIQTU", "B00AGKHF1G", "B00005U8EL", "B0001UZZM2"], "bought_together": ["B00443FMKM", "B004M9ZI0M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00B2BYY1W", "B00443FMKM", "B000E6ESKS", "B00DQN6IOK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 19182}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 64.53, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "0792844041", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X9GHH7Y8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Richard III"}

Robin and Little John (a very funny Nicol Williamson) return to find that the sheriff of Nottingham (Robert Shaw) is up to his old nasty tricks--and that Maid Marian (Audrey Hepburn) is now a nun. Lester brings the same touch to this period film that he did toThe Three MusketeersandThe Four Musketeers, blending authenticity with a knowing wink at the conventions of period films. But the heart of this film is the very palpable emotion between Hepburn and Connery (and between Connery and Williamson).

After Mitchum makes clear his plans to harm Peck's family, a fascinating game of crisscrossing ethics and morality takes place. Where the more recent version seemed trapped in its explicitness, Thompson's film accomplishes a lot with a more economical and telling use of violence.

{"description": "Tackling the story of Jesus for film is bound to incur controversy. Yet, in a bold move, CBS produced the television miniseriesJesus, which not only retells the biblical story, but takes a look at the more human side of the man. Jeremy Sisto stars, and although it takes a little while for him to gather enough momentum to have us believing him in this role, overall he is surprisingly convincing. While the movie does stray from strict scripture--Jesus is shown feeling conflicted over his feelings for Lazarus's sister Mary; Satan, portrayed by Jeroen Krabb&eacute;, works hard at convincing Jesus to stray from his path--most of the plot will be familiar to viewers. Beginning with an adult Jesus, who works with his father as a carpenter, the program traces his life and death through resurrection. The strong supporting cast, including Jacqueline Bisset as Mary, Gary Oldman as Pontius Pilate, and Debra Messing as Mary Magdalene, lends to the credibility of the miniseries. This is a satisfying retelling of the life of Jesus and will please those who want new ways to explore biblical stories, asJesusnot only reinforces the ideals of the New Testament but shows Jesus as a complex individual.--Jenny Brown", "related": {"also_bought": ["1401931944"], "bought_together": ["1401931944"], "also_viewed": ["B002BBLXHU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 357697}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 2.5, "brand": "", "asin": "1573629219", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EAH1ZZMWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jesus [VHS]"}
{"description": "Clint Eastwood (making his very assured directorial debut) is a poetry-spouting stud-muffin DJ stalked by a maniacally amorous fan after a misguided one-night stand in this enjoyably schlocky, undeniably effective film about good intentions gone murderously wacky. Although many of thevery'70s trappings presented here may ultimately be too dated to be taken seriously (including a very self-indulgent jazz number and a hilariously gooey seduction number between Eastwood and Donna Mills), the core premise of infatuation taken out of bounds remains uncomfortably plausible--and was influential enough to be appropriated by one of the biggest hits of the '80s.

{"description": "A mysterious, pilotless plane carries scientist Rex Reason to a colony of America's best and brightest minds. They've been kidnapped by a dying alien race, the Metalunians, to repair their defense shield before their enemies destroy their world completely, toiling under their spying eyes and futuristic security cameras (two-way TVs that dominate every room). Jeff Morrow, under a raised forehead, bronze tan, and snow-white hair, philosophizes as Exeter, the thoughtful Metalunian torn between his duty and his morals as he forces the plucky humans to labor in his race's defense. The moody mystery of the first half turns to pure pulp adventure when the humans are transported across the galaxy to the battle-scarred world of Metaluna, under the threatening watch of a monstrous bug-eyed monster with a giant brain for a head and massive claws for hands. There's a genuine sense of wonder to Joseph Newman's intergalactic adventure, one of the most ambitious science fiction films of the 1950s. The story is simple space opera, but the futuristic designs of glass and metal, the marvelous alien makeup, and grandstanding special effects invest the film with a Technicolor splendor. Faith Domergue co-stars as a nuclear physicist andGilligan's Island's Russell Johnson makes his first professorial appearance as a scientist.

From the future emperor's first strategic victory, a schoolyard snowball fight, to the climactic invasion of Italy,Napoleontruly rules! This is no static, antiquated relic. Among Gance's innovations was to free the camera (for one battle scene, he had it mounted on horseback!). The film's justly celebrated climax features a triptych of synchronized images that anticipates by more than 30 years Cinerama and widescreen. But more than a triumph of filmmaking,Napoleonis a triumph of film restoration and was a boon to the vital cause of film preservation. Gance's movie was long thought lost. But historian Kevin Brownlow, with the cooperation of film archives from around the world, spent more than a decade painstakingly reassembling it. Francis Ford Coppola's name (not to mention a reported quarter of a million of his dollars) helped findNapoleonthe audience this film so richly deserves.

She has a gold mine that no one knows about and she wants him to help her get the gold before anyone else finds out. But, of course, his old gang--who gave him up to the law in the first place--finds out about the mine and wants a piece of it. This was filmed in the late 1970s, when drug use was rampant (and not particularly frowned upon) in Hollywood; keep that in mind when you listen to Nicholson's stuffy-nose delivery.

{"description": "The movie that made \"No wire hangers!\" a household phrase,Mommie Dearestis the very model of a modern \"camp classic,\" so crazily outlandish that it's fascinating. Based on the scathing and scandalous tell-all bestseller by Christina Crawford, the adopted daughter of histrionic Hollywood movie queen Joan Crawford,Mommie Dearestwas billed in advance as a serious dramatic motion-picture biography. But it turned out to be something much, much weirder--a genuine Hollywood oddity that serves up a bizarre mixture of melodramatic trash and outrageous tragi-comedy. Joan Crawford won an Oscar for playing the role of the self-sacrificing mother, the woman who would do anything for her daughter, inMildred Pierce. As depicted by Faye Dunaway (playing the hell out of the role as if she's determined to win another Oscar of her own, damn it!), her role as offscreen parent puts her in a league with big-time scary screen mommies such as Mrs. Bates inPsycho, and Angela Lansbury's &uuml;ber-mom inThe Manchurian Candidate. Dunaway's Crawford torments and terrorizes her adopted children in myriad ways--making them give away their own birthday gifts and rousting them from their beds for frantic after-midnight bathroom-scrubbing attacks. And when, after the death of her Pepsico chairman husband, Crawford tells the board of directors, \"Don't f--- with me, fellas!\" one is very much inclined to heed her warning.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301706587", "6301977963", "B004LWZW4M", "B000005XPV", "6304359721", "6301973410", "B000003KE0", "B00005RERY"], "bought_together": ["6301977963"], "also_viewed": ["0767903579"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 304567}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.67, "brand": "", "asin": "6300213919", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N957ZKB0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mommie Dearest [VHS]"}

{"description": "When Samuel (Lukas Haas), a young Amish boy traveling with his mother Rachel (Kelly McGillis), witnesses the murder of a police officer in a public restroom, he and his mother become the temporary wards of John Book (Harrison Ford), a detective who's been assigned to solve the crime.

Once Book realizes that the police chief is in on it, too, he whisks Samuel and Rachel back home to Amish country, where he himself goes into hiding as a plain Amish man. The juxtaposition between the life of the Amish and the violence of inner-city police corruption work surprisingly well for the story, and Kelly McGillis as the falling in love widow gives an almost perfect performance. Directed by Peter Weir, the film is extremely successful in drawing the viewer into its world and, accordingly, is immensely entertaining. The only thing that mars its polish is the one-dimensional, almost cartoonish handling of the upper-echelon police corruption--a subtler, more realistic treatment of this aspect of the story would have rendered the film near perfect.--James McGrath", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792116887", "B000007OY0", "6304259131", "0800125762", "6302816629", "6302238331", "6302935148", "0792133153", "6303269834", "B00000JS61", "080018789X", "630442972X", "B000003KDG", "0790743213", "6302415853", "6304071876", "079284517X", "B00005PJ8I", "6303402348", "0790748169", "6303057225", "6303637574", "6301599896", "6303942830", "B0000068ZQ", "6303020089", "6300181340", "0783235607", "6303402070", "B00007E2F6", "0790734079", "6300182479", "B00000J2L7", "6301734734", "079212569X", "6301736362", "6302909023", "0800116917", "6305126062", "6302226899", "6303696813", "6300247112", "0783226152", "B00000F5PI", "6305426678", "B000006N70", "0800132009", "6303058981", "6305012792", "B003MG6FJY", "6301976924", "5559477621", "B00005A1VH", "0783231482", "6303451462", "B000063UUP", "0792107683", "0800123506", "6304458975", "6303109950", "0790733935", "6304214502", "0792838556"], "bought_together": ["0792116887", "6302816629"], "also_viewed": ["6302380588"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 257292}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6300214567", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JAT9P45FL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Witness [VHS]"}
{"description": "AlthoughStar Trek: The Motion Picturehad been a box-office hit, it was by no means a unanimous success withStar Trekfans, who responded much more favorably to the \"classicTrek\" scenario ofStar Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. Inspired by the \"Space Seed\" episode of the original TV series, the film reunites newly promoted Admiral Kirk with his nemesis from the earlier episode--the genetically superior Khan (Ricardo Montalban)--who is now seeking revenge upon Kirk for having been imprisoned on a desolated planet. Their battle ensues over control of the Genesis device, a top-secret Starfleet project enabling entire planets to be transformed into life-supporting worlds, pioneered by the mother (Bibi Besch) of Kirk's estranged and now-adult son. While Mr. Spock mentors the young Vulcan Lt. Saavik (then-newcomer Kirstie Alley), Kirk must battle Khan to the bitter end, through a climactic starship chase and an unexpected crisis that will cost the life of Kirk's closest friend.

Grant was still at his best, Loren was bewitching Hollywood as an exotic new ingnue, and offscreen they had had a torrid affair a couple of years earlier, during the shooting of The Pride and the Passion. The two tanned stars are the main attraction in this romantic comedy, which installs single dad Cary and his three children on a dilapidated houseboat on the Potomac River. Sophia is the maid, except she's not really a maid but the cultured daughter of a famous musician. Yes, this is one of those situation comedies in which every problem could be cleared up if only one character told the truth about the situation. If that sort of thing drives you crazy, best skip this one. It's no classic, but those two icons are awfully appealing. --Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["630299005X", "0782006779", "0782006809", "0780614097", "6301964012", "6302227127", "6304383177", "B0000040EO", "6300215741", "6301586026", "0792837630", "630233683X", "6305123616", "0783235593", "6302760097", "630150528X", "6302054095", "6304546270", "6300215598", "6301586034", "6303102441", "6302990076", "B00004RFFA", "B00004WZR1", "080013222X", "6302952581", "6302241103", "6300182118", "B00005RRG6", "6301973186"], "bought_together": ["0782006809", "0782006779"], "also_viewed": ["0780614097", "6301964012"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 212995}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.08, "brand": "", "asin": "6300215628", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PJPXDP3AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Houseboat [VHS]"}

{"description": "The prestigious filmmaking trio of producer Ismail Merchant, director James Ivory, and screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala had made other critically acclaimed films beforeA Room with a Viewwas released in 1985, but it was this popular film that made them art-house superstars. Splendidly adapted from the novel by E.M. Forster, it's a comedy of the heart, a passionate romance and a study of repression within the British class system of manners and mores. It's that system of rigid behavior that prevents young Lucy Honeychurch (Helena Bonham Carter) from accepting the loving advances of a free-spirited suitor (Julian Sands), who fears that she will follow through with her engagement to a priggish intellectual (Daniel Day-Lewis) whose capacity for passion is virtually nonexistent. During and after a trip to Italy with her protective companion (Maggie Smith), Lucy gradually gets in touch with her true emotions. The fun of watchingA Room with a Viewcomes from seeing how Lucy's thoughts and feelings finally arrive at the same romantic conclusion. Through an abundance of humor both subtle and overt, this crowd-pleasing \"art movie\" rose to an unexpected level of popular appeal. The Merchant-Ivory team received eight Academy Award nominations for their efforts, and won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay, Art Direction, and Costume Design.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000048PO", "B00003CXC9", "6302728657", "6303052223", "6301965817"], "bought_together": ["B0000048PO", "B00003CXC9"], "also_viewed": ["B004SIP7D0", "B0015LPRSI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 195581}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 23.98, "brand": "", "asin": "6300250512", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417J0G7GBCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Room With a View [VHS]"}

{"description": "Based upon T.H. White's beloved novel, this Disney-fied version chronicles the tutoring of the Once and Future King, Arthur, as handled by the magician Merlin.Swordwas a portent of things to come, with slapstick upbraiding storytelling, and cultural in-jokes substituting for wonder. But there's much to enjoy here as Merlin shows Newt, the young Arthur, things that will help him become the ruler of the Britons. The transformation sequences, where the boy is turned into a fish, a bird, and a squirrel are vintage Disney. The oft-repeated scene of Merlin battling it out with the mean old Madame Mim still is worth a few chuckles, but it belies the problem with most of the film--the scenes are only there for the chuckles. References by Merlin to television and other items of modern life also mar the generally innocuous landscape.

{"description": "This adaptation of the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel, scripted by Francis Ford Coppola, puts costume design and art direction above the intricacies of character. It's certainly a handsome try, and perhaps no movie could captureThe Great Gatsbyin its entirety. Robert Redford is an interesting casting choice as Gatsby, the millionaire isolated in his mansion, still dreaming of the woman he lost. And Sam Waterston is perfect as the narrator, Nick, who brings the dream girl Daisy Buchanan back to Gatsby. No, the problem seems to be that director Jack Clayton fell in love with the flapper dresses and the party scenes and the Jazz Age tunes, ending up with a Classics Illustrated version of a great book rather than a fresh, organic take on the text. While Redford grows more quietly intriguing in the film, Mia Farrow's pallid performance as Daisy leaves you wondering why Gatsby, or anyone else, should care so much about his grand passion. The effective supporting cast includes Bruce Dern as Daisy's husband, and Scott Wilson and Karen Black as the low-rent couple whose destinies cross the sun-drenched protagonists. (That's future star Patsy Kensit as Daisy's little daughter.) The film won two Oscars--not surprisingly, for costumes and musical score.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["0800125762", "6302816629", "6300182215", "6305718792", "6300215814", "B0001E7LQG", "6304925158", "6302415853", "6302281415", "6300216500", "6300262782", "6303052223", "0790744759", "0800124693", "0792839846", "6304039522", "0800106032", "6302936381", "6303823351", "630382336X", "0792110803"], "bought_together": ["0743273567"], "also_viewed": ["B00DHHWXYY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 232595}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.65, "brand": "", "asin": "6301247485", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XW0FSNT7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Great Gatsby [VHS]"}

{"description": "Melanie Griffith had a fling with stardom in this Mike Nichols comedy about an executive secretary (Griffith) who can't get her deserved shot at upward mobility in the brokerage industry. Hardly taken seriously by male bosses, things aren't really any better for her once she starts working for a female exec (Sigourney Weaver, never more delightful), a narcissist with a boy-toy banker (Harrison Ford) and a tendency to steal the best ideas from her underlings. When Weaver's character is laid up with a broken leg, Griffith poses as a replacement wheeler-dealer, flirting with Ford and working on a new client who doesn't suspect the deception. Nichols brings a lot of snap and sass to Kevin Wade's smart script about chafing against class restrictions and perceptions. Sundry scenes are played quite charmingly, especially those of Griffith and Ford's mutual pickup in a bar and Joan Cusack's championing of Griffith's crusade.

Real-life husband Robert Stephens plays Jean's married lover, Celia Johnson excels as the hostile headmistress, and Pamela Franklin is the deadpan whistle-blower within Miss Brodie's coven.

{"description": "Robin Williams stars as an English teacher who doesn't fit into the conservative prep school where he teaches, but whose charisma and love of poetry inspires several boys to revive a secret society with a bohemian bent. The script is well meaning but a little trite, though director Peter Weir (The Truman Show) adds layers of emotional depth in scenes of conflict between the kids and adults. (A subplot involving one father's terrible pressure on his son--played by Robert Sean Leonard--to drop his interest in theater reaches heartbreaking proportions.) Williams is given plenty of latitude to work in his brand of improvisational humor, though it is all well-woven into his character's style of instruction.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304938756", "6305576173", "6300214753", "B0043X1FL8", "B00000IQV7", "6301569385", "079070546X", "0800125762", "630018403X", "0792837894", "6304994540", "6300270971", "B00000JKNP", "6304466498", "B00005PJ8I"], "bought_together": ["6304938756"], "also_viewed": ["B001D7T6A4", "B00007ELF1", "B001VC99HQ", "B004FQX5A2", "B00008CMSU", "1880521008", "B0000633U4", "B000JJSJO6", "B000KLQUS0", "0788816454", "B000FIHNA2", "B00000K0DQ", "B002AT8KBU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 247066}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.74, "brand": "", "asin": "6301627768", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/714M31SCE5L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Dead Poets Society [VHS]"}

{"description": "This blistering little black comedy was well ahead of its time when released in 1947. Originally, Orson Welles had wanted Chaplin to star in his drama about a French mass murderer named Landru, but Chaplin was hesitant to act for another director, and used the idea himself. He plays a dapper gent named Henri Verdoux (who assumes a number of identities), a civilized monster who marries wealthy women, then murders them (as we meet him, he's gathering roses as an incinerator ominously bellows smoke in the background) and collects their money to support his real family. The Little Tramp is now a distant memory, though this was the first film not to feature Chaplin's beloved creation.Verdouxis largely viciously clever until it gets too heavy-handed, as evidenced when a woman he spares returns years later as the mistress of a munitions manufacturer. Ultimately, Chaplin breaks character (much as he did inThe Great Dictator) to preach to the masses, declaring that against the machines of war that grip the planet, humble killer Verdoux is \"an amateur by comparison.\"--David Kronke", "related": {"also_bought": ["630256185X", "6302561965"], "also_viewed": ["6301798384"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 488884}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "", "asin": "630181214X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BYY3QETFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Charlie Chaplin: Monsieur Verdoux [VHS]"}

{"description": "The National Lampoon brand has always had very little to do with the movies it has graced. Even the not-so-bad Chevy Chase Vacation entries didn't really need the imprimatur of the famous satire magazine that had its heyday about 30 years ago: They pretty much became a brand in and of themselves. The same goes for theVan Wildermovies, which we probably haven't seen the last of. Even though Ryan Reynolds, who originated the title character in 2002 doesn't appear, his lowbrow, good-natured goofball spirit remains. The star this time is the eminently likeable Kal Penn, who made a big splash in 2004'sHarold & Kumar Go to White Castleand was Van Wilder's dorky sidekick Taj Mahal Badalandabad in the first movie. Here he displays more of his mentor's glib confidence, maturing into a sex-crazed, fun-loving grad student roaming the hallowed halls of England's (fake) Camford University. The comic situations he encounters there are simply a pretext for the typical sex, flatulence, beer-drinking, and class-division jokes you'd expect. Most of them come off well, thanks to Penn's comic aplomb, rubbery versatility and the rivalry he induces between the geeky misfit gang he ends up leading, and the snooty, upper-class Fox and Hound fraternity that clearly has to be given its lowbrow do. The battle for the pretty girl (Lauren Cohan, in truly good sport mode) who happens to be the property of super-twit Pipp Everett, the Earl of Grey, ends in predictable fashion, as does the rise of Taj's minions as bearers of the torch for the nextVan Wilder, whether Van Wilder appears in it or not. --Ted FryBeyondVan Wilder 2: The Rise of TajMore National Lampoon MoviesMore from Kal PennVan Wilder's Guide to Graduating College in 8 Years or More: Everything You Need to Know About Books, Beer and BabesStills fromVan Wilder 2: The Rise of Taj", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000069CF0", "B001O0TWYK", "B000RGX0DQ", "B000GB5M4C", "B000CPH9PM", "B00026WTZQ", "B0023TCWE8", "B00068WOH8", "B0026BXHQ0", "B001MFNB58", "B00260HH1W", "B000Y7U93C", "B000IZJZIU", "B002UJIY0C", "B006OFN052", "B002CLKV54", "B004DTLKCG", "B004GTVU6O", "B001AEF6HM", "B006WXHJLC", "B000LC3ICE", "B000JJ4DNW", "B000WC39KO", "B005LAIH9A", "B000069HQ2", "B000JJSJPU", "B000M7FOO8", "B000EMGJAO", "B000I8OMEO", "B00005JKYX", "B00005JMX6", "B000M7XRGU", "B0009ZE9VW", "B0014VPFV8", "B000QQML14", "B003TY2SPO", "B001L9EXTS", "B0013K2ZG8", "B001UV4X4W", "B000PMGS6S", "B0057FGCWS", "B0002V7TMY", "B004SIP8ES", "B00GRZPRB4", "B00005U8QN", "0783230338", "B000OVLBHG", "B00005JL8Z", "B0009P42WI", "B000BKVQS4", "B0007GP700", "B0001MMGUO", "B000085EFK", "B00GDDNFDW", "B00AEFXVW0", "B002ZG99B8", "B000VI70QS", "B000274T94", "B00003CXK7", "B0002IQMAM", "B000XA5K48", "B00005JN9P", "B000K7UBSO", "B00007AJGM", "B006OFN0ES", "B00005V9HR", "B001BEK8HE", "B000C20VS2", "B00015HX5O", "B001MEWBVO", "B000O76ZOO", "B00AEFY7I2", "B000BKJ758", "B0001XAQ9Q", "B001NPD9LS", "B001OD4S50", "B0045HCJGC", "B008M4C1EO", "B00003CXPS", "B000BBOUUE", "B000HRLWWQ", "B00005JM5B", "B000I0RNVQ", "B0012RLX88", "B005JZBPR8", "B00008L3W3", "B000H5TVKI", "B000M341R8", "B000E6EHE0", "B001BTYBN6", "B000EQ5V8G", "B004EPZ084", "B00CPTUO1Y", "B000G0O5I2", "B003Y5H5EW", "B002GSXKPG", "B000Y11BC6", "B00AEFYZCU", "B004EPYZS0", "B000TJBNEO"], "bought_together": ["B001O0TWYK", "B000069CF0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000069CF0", "B001O0TWYK", "B005LAIH9A", "B000CPH9PM"]}, "price": 12.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 42700}, "asin": "6301964160", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51vd9xGPJ0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "National Lampoon's Van Wilder: The Rise of Taj (Unrated Edition)"}

{"description": "James Mason plays Professor Oliver Lindenbrook, a scientist hoping to find the world's core in this 1959 adaptation of the Jules Verne novel. He leads his unusual party on an expedition to the center of the earth, by way of a volcano in Iceland. On the way, they encounter enormous mushrooms and giant prehistoric monsters. Produced by Michael Todd with then-spectacular special effects, the story was modernized to 1950s sensibilities. Mason gives this class, while Arlene Dahl and Diane Baker are the romantic interests. And Pat Boone is more palatable than you might expect as a secondary lead.

The show shocked and seduced, arousing its audience as it continually reflected society in ways unprecedented and still unequaled.Norman Lear, the show's creator, hosts this 20th anniversary best of the Bunkers, offering scenes from the finest and funniest episodes: Archie slinging ethnic slurs, Meathead Mike ranting on Richard Nixon, Edith and Archie confronting his impotency, and Edith learning of the lump in her breast. These and many more highlights remind how the show scandalously addressed topics taboo at the time, yet undeniably present in everyday life.As the warning screen indicated when the show made its debut:The program you are about to see seeks to throw a humorous spotlight on our frailties, prejudices, and concerns. By making them a source of laughter, we hope to show--in a mature fashion--just how absurd they are.Indeed.--Stephan Magcosta", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767813189", "0767813227", "0767826000", "0767818407", "B000CCBCCG"], "bought_together": ["0767813189", "0767813227"], "also_viewed": ["B008HUSFTS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 358913}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 2.41, "brand": "", "asin": "6302240840", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G13X8DXEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "All in the Family 20th Anniversary [VHS]"}

{"description": "The short life and passionate music of romantic composer Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Chopin provide the foundations for this 1945 drama, which proved influential in its gaudy, undeniably watchable formula of historical exaggeration and shrewdly simplified motives for its principals.  In an Oscar-nominated performance, Cornel Wilde presents the Polish native as a passionate nationalist driven by his love of his native country and his hatred of its czarist regime, a thematic focus that can be forgiven in light of the political backdrop at the time of the production.  Already a prodigy in his native land, where he's mentored by a shamelessly scenery-chewing Paul Muni as Professor Elsner, Chopin flees to Paris where his flashing eyes, dark nimbus of curls, and florid technique earn him stardom, while his involvement with the writer George Sand (a beautiful Merle Oberon, even when draped in then-provocatively masculine garb) introduces a romantic crescendo.  Still, the tortured pianist-composer pines for his homeland, frets about its political fate, and begins to wither under the rigors of his new career as ur-superstar; in a typically over-the-top but riveting image, we see drops of blood spatter across the keyboard as he thunders through a recital, gallantly ignoring his failing health to spread his music and, by extension, awareness of Poland's fate.

{"description": "This belated and semi-inspired sequel to 1933'sThe Invisible Manfinds the earlier film's Claude Rains replaced in the title role by Vincent Price, appearing in his first starring role just two years after making his Hollywood debut in the now-forgotten 1938 comedyService De Luxe. Rather than repeat the scenario of the Invisible Man going mad from the effects of his own invisibility serum, this engaging mystery begins when a murderer (Cedric Hardwicke) plots to frame his brother (Price), who then uses the invisibility serum to escape from jail and clear his name. Price is a fine replacement for Rains, since both men were blessed with a mellifluous voice that would become the focus of their performances. Once again, John P. Fulton provided the groundbreaking (and still impressive) special effects, and the film contains a few eerily clever surprises that distract from the obvious symptoms of that most persistent of Hollywood maladies: sequelitis.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300185281", "6303129013", "6302526175", "6302843219", "6302843197", "6302843200", "6302526167", "6302841844", "6302841771", "6302841798", "630252542X", "6302841763", "6302843227", "6302120101", "6300183084", "6302841879", "630252587X", "6303129153", "6300185443", "6302526140", "6300183629", "630312917X", "630284178X", "B0029Z8K7O", "B0000694WM", "6301257014", "6302526086", "6301005783", "6303129161", "6302526191", "6300183092", "6303129188", "6300181278", "6300181286", "6304681003"], "bought_together": ["6300185281"], "also_viewed": ["6300185281", "6303129013", "6301005783", "6302841763", "6302526140", "6300183084", "6300181286", "6302843200"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 372872}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 16.87, "brand": "", "asin": "6302526094", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VGSRCPBZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Invisible Man Returns [VHS]"}

{"description": "From the moment the young Kunta Kinte (LeVar Burton) is stolen from his life and ancestral home in 18th-century Africa and brought under inhumane conditions to be auctioned as a slave in America, a line is begun that leads from this most shameful chapter in U.S. history to the 20th-century author Alex Haley, a Kinte descendant. The late Haley's acclaimed bookRootswas adapted into this six-volume television miniseries, which was a widely watched phenomenon in 1977. The programs cover several generations in the antebellum South and end with the story of \"Chicken\" George, a freed slave played by Ben Vereen whose family feels the agony of entrenched racism and learns to fight it. Between the lives of Kunta and George, we meet a number of memorable characters, black and white, and learn much about the emotional and physical torments of slavery, from beatings and rapes to the forced separation of spouses and families. Nothing like this had ever confronted so many mainstream Americans when the series was originally broadcast, and the extent to which the country was nudged a degree or two toward enlightenment was instantly obvious.Rootsstill has that ability to open one's eyes, and engage an audience in a sweeping, memorable drama at the same time.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302571243", "6304331908", "B00000IC9T", "B000N2BKC2", "6302150620", "0783215126", "B0000560W6", "6301810678", "B000XA5JWG", "B004EXWGIS", "630306020X", "6300215830", "6300270971", "B000E8M0VA", "6302457254", "B000003U12"], "also_viewed": ["B00005JL2W", "B000T22Q9W", "1593154496", "B0058KGHX6"]}, "price": 17.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 240730}, "asin": "6302571251", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61HJFSV6Y7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Roots 6 Video Box Set [VHS]"}

As she battles the prison authorities (and is aided by the prisoners) in trying to kill the alien, she must also cope with a distinctly shortened lifespan that awaits her.

{"description": "This silky smooth film noir pits gruff police detective Dana Andrews, stiff and blunt in his street-bred manners, against a cultured columnist and acidic wit (Clifton Webb at his prissiest) in a battle of wits during a murder investigation. The cop is a romantic hiding under a hard-boiled exterior who falls in love with the beautiful victim through the portrait that hangs in her apartment. Gene Tierney, whose heart-shaped face mixes the exotic with the girl next door, brings the poise and calm of a model to her role as the object of every man's gaze and the target of a killer.Laura, handsomely shot in dreamy black and white, is the first and best of Otto Preminger's cool, controlled murder mysteries. In the gritty world of film noir it remains the most refined and elegant example of the genre, but under the tasteful decor and high-society fashions lies a world seething in jealousy, passion, blackmail, and murder.

(In fact, the original theatrical aspect ratio ofThe Shiningwas 1.66:1, meaning that a relatively small portion of the image is lost.) Kubrick also chose mono over stereo,  believing that inconsistencies in theatrical sound systems resulted in loss of control over theatrical presentation.

{"description": "An elderly college professor sets out in his car to receive an honorary degree--and takes a trip instead through his own past and subconscious--in this bittersweet but ultimately tender and understanding 1957 film by Swedish master Ingmar Bergman. Casting Swedish star Victor Sj&ouml;str&ouml;m in the lead, Bergman, then at the height of his powers as an international filmmaker, uses flashbacks and bright, lyrical storytelling to capture the full arc of one man's life: the successes that seem fleeting, the disappointments that linger in the memory, the regrets that never seem to let go. In some ways, it can be seen as a forerunner of Woody Allen'sDeconstructing Harry, except that Bergman's sense of irony is always more profound.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303107338", "6303107346", "6300150151", "6304209584", "6302798248", "B00000J2L7", "6302783348", "6303261418", "630526323X", "B000007NTY", "6302641888", "630264187X", "6302919509", "B00005ATQA", "6303107354"], "bought_together": ["6303107346", "6303107338"], "also_viewed": ["6303107346", "6303107338", "6303107354"]}, "price": 15.57, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 390240}, "asin": "6302783356", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F5X2EAK1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wild Strawberries [VHS]"}

{"description": "Britain's Hammer Studios had been making films for decades before they suddenly redefined themselves with this lurid remake of the Universal Studios horror classic. Prohibited by Universal from copying their blocky makeup (and their script, for that matter), Hammer returned to Mary Shelley's novel for inspiration, and then went in its own direction. Peter Cushing plays Dr.&nbsp;Frankenstein as the rational scientist turned cold-blooded criminal in his campaign to discover the secret of life, committing murder to further his ends, or to remove an inconvenient mistress. Christopher Lee is the pitiable creature, a terrified behemoth more innocent newborn than malevolent monster. His pale, pallid, grotesquely scarred face was so thickly applied that he emotes almost exclusively with his eyes and his awkward, stumbling gestures. The not-so-good Dr.&nbsp;Frankenstein is the true monster, a ruthless scientist whose rejection of superstition extends to all moral considerations. Shot in blood-red color by Hammer stalwart Terence Fisher, the stylish, often salacious film became Hammer's biggest success to date, made horror stars out of the classically trained Cushing and Lee, and transformed the B studio into the Hammer we know and love today: the house that dripped blood.The Horror of Draculaimmediately followed, reuniting the winning team of Cushing and Lee, and Cushing returned in four of six Frankenstein sequels.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302491975", "6302814707", "6303637469", "6304361025", "630252542X", "6302843227", "6302843219", "630018529X", "6300183084"], "bought_together": ["6302814707"], "also_viewed": ["6303637469"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 413382}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 29.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6302814669", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AQX51CJ4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Curse of Frankenstein [VHS]"}

Genuinely haunting and truly sorrowful, this series was many people's first introduction to the impact that Hitler's Final Solution had on everyday Germans.

{"description": "Choreographer-turned-director Bob Fosse (Cabaret,Lenny) turns the camera on himself in this nervy, sometimes unnerving 1979 feature, a nakedly autobiographical piece that veers from gritty drama to razzle-dazzle musical, allegory to satire. It's an indication of his bravura, and possibly his self-absorption, that Fosse (who also cowrote the script) literally opens alter ego Joe Gideon's heart in a key scene--an unflinching glimpse of cardiac surgery, shot during an actual open-heart procedure.Roy Scheider makes a brave and largely successful leap out of his usual romantic lead roles to step into Gideon's dancing pumps, and supplies a plausible sketch of an extravagant, self-destructive, self-loathing creative dynamo, while Jessica Lange serves as a largely allegorical Muse, one of the various women that the philandering Gideon pursues (and usually abandons). Gideon's other romantic partners include Fosse's own prot&eacute;g&eacute; (and a major keeper of his choreographic style since his  death), Ann Reinking, whose leggy grace is seductive both \"onstage\" and off.Fosse/Gideon's collision course with mortality, as well as his priapic obsession with the opposite sex, may offer clues into the libidinal core of the choreographer's dynamic, sexualized style of dance, but musical aficionados will be forgiven for fast-forwarding to cut out the self-analysis and focus on the music, period. At its best--as in the knockout opening, scored to George Benson's strutting version of \"On Broadway,\" which fuses music, dance, and dazzling camera work into a paean to Fosse's hoofer nation--All That Jazzoffers a sequence of classic Fosse numbers, hard-edged, caustic, and joyously physical.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302281415", "6300147983"], "bought_together": ["6302281415"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 400975}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.01, "brand": "", "asin": "6303394000", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51841M2TZHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "All That Jazz [VHS]"}

{"description": "Have Rocket, Will Travelis the first Three Stooges feature film after the team became television icons and Joe DeRita was called in to replace Joe Besser (who had replaced Shemp, who had replaced Curly). Aimed at a younger audience, it included a good deal of the physical violence theirSnow Whitefilm tried to avoid. Curly Joe was given the old Curly shtick  of being struck by a tool, exclaiming a painful \"Oooo\" and then giving a  surprised reaction when the tool appears bent from the contact with his cement- like head. He is also prone to a weaker version of his role model's \"Woowoowoo.\"The plot revolves around the team's accidental launch into space and their adventures on a Venus that looks identical to Earth, including breathable air but housing a giant tarantula that breathes fire and a unicorn that speaks slightly archaic English. There is also an unconvincing robot that is lonesome enough to create three fellow robots in the form of the three Earthlings. This leads merely to a routine already familiar to viewers of old-time comedies: a chase down a corridor lined with doors through which the six are exiting and reentering in a physically impossible way.The final sequence in which the returning \"heroes\" wreck a social event is overly familiar from the earlier films, especially the old \"sofa spring stuck  the rear\" routine; and indeed it all seems tacked on to stretch the film to its  76 minutes. Light-comedy veteran Jerome Cowan does his best in a role that would have been handled by Jimmy Finlayson in a Laurel & Hardy film.

{"description": "Death has never stopped anyone from crafting a sequel to a successful film, but Terence Fisher and screenwriter Jimmy Sangster rather ingeniously twist the climactic execution ofThe Curse of Frankensteininto the opening ofThe Revenge of Frankenstein. With a cold-blooded flourish that would become his trademark, Frankenstein plots his escape and sends an innocent (a priest, no less) to take his place on the guillotine, leaving himself free to continue his experiments. As the new head of a hospital for the poor, he builds a body for his crippled assistant from parts amputated from his patients, but body battles mind for supremacy and turns the newly ambulatory man into a bloodthirsty cannibal. Once again Fisher makes the most of a constricted budget, turning his poorhouse hospital into a cramped, dank hole and splurging on another colorful laboratory of buzzing devices and a centerpiece tank for his suspended creature. There are few innocents in the Frankenstein films and this is no different: high-society dandies are hypocrites, poorhouse patients thieves and opportunists, and of course the driven doctor is willing to sacrifice anything and anyone to achieve his goal. The clever conclusion, which lays the groundwork for the next sequel, was curiously ignored when the third installment finally arrived six years later inThe Evil of Frankenstein.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302814669"], "also_viewed": ["6302814669"]}, "price": 2.83, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 564061}, "asin": "6303637469", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ASCZNFTRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Revenge of Frankenstein [VHS]"}
{"description": "Ever since this convoluted thriller dazzled audiences and critics in 1995 and won an Oscar for Christopher McQuarrie's twisting screenplay,The Usual Suspectshas continued to divide movie lovers into opposite camps. While a lot of people take great pleasure from the movie's now-famous central mystery (namely, \"Who is Keyser S&ouml;ze?\"), others aren't so easily impressed by a movie that's too enamored of its own cleverness to make much sense. After all, what are we to make of a final scene that renders the entire movie obsolete? Half the fun ofThe Usual Suspectsis the debate it provokes and the sheer pleasure of watching its dynamic cast in action, led (or should we say, mislead) by Oscar-winner Kevin Spacey as the club-footed con man who recounts the saga of enigmatic Hungarian mobster Keyser S&ouml;ze. Spacey's in a band of thieves that includes Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Pollak, and Benicio Del Toro, all gathered in a plot to steal a large shipment of cocaine. The story is told in flashback as a twisted plot being described by Spacey's character to an investigating detective (Chazz Palmintieri), andThe Usual Suspectsis enjoyable for the way it keeps the viewer guessing right up to its surprise ending. Whether that ending will enhance or extinguish the pleasure is up to each viewer to decide.

{"description": "This stylish combination of expressionistic horror and deadpan black comedy centers on the activities of a beautiful female vampire on the streets of New York City. Playing fast and loose with the Dracula legend, the film examines the legendary count's children, particularly the alluring and mysterious Nadja (Elina Lowensohn). At the film's beginning, Nadja is celebrating her father's demise and hoping to begin a new life. She hopes that this life will include Lucy (Galaxy Craze), a spunky young woman that she seduces after an encounter in a New York bar. Unfortunately, Lucy is already married, to the nephew of eccentric vampire hunter Van Helsing (Peter Fonda), who disposed of Nadja's father and has now set his sights on capturing the daughter. Matters are further complicated when Nadja's brother Edgar (Jared Harris), a vampire who wishes to give up his blood-sucking nature, also becomes involved. Gorgeously shot by cinematographer Jim Denault in a mixture of 35mm black-and-white and low-budget Pixelvision video, the film resembles a combination of the surrealist visions of co-producer David Lynch and the quirky humor and stylized sensibility of Hal Hartley. The convoluted narrative sometimes fails to gel, and the self-conscious, arty approach will not appeal to audiences looking for conventional thrills, but those with a taste for the unusual may find the film an appealing contemporary spin on a familiar legend.", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 595306}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6303924832", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/410QN5FKZKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Nadja [VHS]"}

Setting a milestone for screen violence that paved the way for Sam Peckinpah'sThe Wild Bunch, this exercise in mythologized biography should not be labeled as a bloodbath; as critic Pauline Kael wrote in her rave review, &quot;it's the absence of sadism that throws the audience off balance.&quot; The film is more of a poetic ode to the Great Depression, starring the dream team of Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway as the titular antiheroes, who barrel across the South and Midwest robbing banks with Clyde's brother Buck (Gene Hackman), Buck's frantic wife Blanche (Estelle Parsons), and their faithful accomplice C.W.

{"description": "It's a pity this oceangoing adventure wasn't fully appreciated during its theatrical release in 1996, if only because its climactic storm sequence (hence the movie's title) was awesome on the big screen and inevitably less impressive on video. Mixed reviews also curtailed its box-office potential, but as you might expect from Ridley Scott--the director ofBlade RunnerandThelma & Louise--this is a beautifully photographed movie that will thrill anyone who is drawn to the romance and danger of the open sea. The story is a rite-of-passage adventure for a group of high school boys who spend their senior year as the crew-in-training on theAlbatross, a sailing vessel skippered by an experienced sailor and schoolmaster (Jeff Bridges) who teaches hard lessons of teamwork and individual responsibility. As they sail to the tip of South America and back, the young men face many challenges that will shape their character, in addition to the carnal pleasures of shore leave in exotic ports of call. It's a traditional story, and Scott doesn't bring anything particularly new to this sailboat variation ofDead Poets SocietyandScent of a Woman.

{"description": "Critics were decidedly mixed about this 1996 drama from Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci, and the movie enjoyed only a brief theatrical release. Now it's best known for its early appearance by Liv Tyler as a 19-year-old beauty named Lucy who summers at a villa in Tuscany with a variety of artistic types who immediately respond to her inspirational innocence. An amateur poet who has decided it's time to lose her virginity, Lucy has come to Italy after the death of her mother, who visited this artist's refuge 20 years earlier. Several young Italian men find Lucy quite heavenly (she is, after all, Liv Tyler), and she's not immune to their attentions, but she'd rather spend time with a playwright (Jeremy Irons) who is dying of AIDS and therefore has something other than sex on his mind. The movie's plot is about as substantial as Tyler's character (she's sexy, all right, but hardly an intellectual muse), butStealing Beautycreates a serene mood that's so soothing you'll want to book a flight to Tuscany immediately, just to soak up the setting's idyllic atmosphere. If you're in the right frame of mind, this movie is like a balm for the soul, and Tyler and Bertolucci can share the credit for making this two-hour vacation so charmingly relaxing.--Jeff Shannon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 417423}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6304195281", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q2KZSS3CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Stealing Beauty [VHS]"}

That same president, late in the film, personally flies a jet fighter to deliver a payload of missiles against an attack by extraterrestrials.Independence Dayis the kind of movie so giddy with its own outrageousness that one doesn't even blink at such howlers in the plot. Directed by Roland Emmerich,Independence Dayis a pastiche of conventions from flying-saucer movies from the 1940s and 1950s, replete with icky monsters and bizarre coincidences that create convenient shortcuts in the story. (Such as the way the girlfriend of one of the film's heroes--played by Will Smith--just happens to run across the president's injured wife, who are then both rescued by Smith's character who somehow runs across them in alien-ravaged Los Angeles County.)

This time, we follow the fortunes of four people who lock themselves inside a shopping mall to get away from the marauding dead and who then immerse themselves in unabashed consumerism, taking what they want from an array of clothing and jewelry shops, making gourmet meals, etc. It is Romero's take on Louis XVI in the modern world: keep the starving masses at bay and crank up the insulated indulgence.

{"description": "Salted pork shanks as leitmotiv in a dark comedy about an absurd love triangle: this is what post-Francocineis all about (food and sex). Spanishtortillas(i.e., potato omelets) are also big in this one. Director Jos&eacute; Juan Bigas Luna'sJam&oacute;n Jam&oacute;nis intelligent, wry, and--despite the formulaic narrative that melodrama must essentially contain--unpredictable. At times his film exudes a certain Almod&oacute;var flavor, but there is an edge, perhaps a heavy-handedness, to the dark humor that is either Luna's success or his downfall. The film garnered the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival, after all. Try to follow: sexy Penelope Cruz (Belle Epoque) is growing up with her mother outside town on the highway, on the wrong side of the highway. Together they run a truck stop where cars and life literally race past. Cruz is in love with Jord&iacute; Molla, by whom she is pregnant. Molla's bourgeois mother, played by Anna Galiena (Being Human), thinks he can and should do better. (Of course, neither Cruz nor his mother knows of the erotic, hmm, avian interludes Molla enjoys on the side.) To save her son from the lower classes, Galiena hires Javier Bardem, a muscular, pretty man (whose regular consumption of the pork he distributes for a living has enhanced his sexual appeal) to pursue Cruz. The dark comedy finds a proper ending to the triangle in a grotesque but comedic landscape of death. This is not a cookie-cutter movie but rather one that will resonate with both your light and dark sides. After each surprise, you'll chuckle, feel guilty, and chuckle again.--Erik Macki", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000N3T0DW", "B002VECLXC", "B00005LZOD", "B00005421W", "B00008G8MG", "B00A8PPR5K", "B0000TWNDI"], "also_viewed": ["B000I1EF16", "B00J6V1RBK", "B000N3T0DW"]}, "price": 10.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 288097}, "asin": "6304326297", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512B0TK90YL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jamon Jamon [VHS]"}

{"description": "After Martin Scorsese went to Hollywood in 1972 to direct the low-budgetBoxcar Berthafor B-movie mogul Roger Corman, the young director showed the film to maverick director John Cassavetes and got an instant earful of urgent advice. \"It's crap,\" said Cassavetes in no uncertain terms, \"now go out and make something that comes from your heart.\" Scorsese took the advice and focused his energy onMean Streets, a riveting contemporary film about low-life gangsters in New York's Little Italy that critic Pauline Kael would later call \"a true original, and a triumph of personal filmmaking.\" Starring Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel in roles that announced their talent to the world, it set the stage for Scorsese's emergence as one of the greatest American filmmakers. Introducing themes and character types that Scorsese would return to inTaxi Driver,GoodFellas,Casino, and other films, the loosely structured story is drawn directly from Scorsese's background in the Italian neighborhoods of New York, and it seethes with the raw vitality of a filmmaker who has found his creative groove. As the irresponsible and reckless Johnny Boy, De Niro offers striking contrast to Keitel's Charlie, who struggles to reconcile gang life with Catholic guilt. More of an episodic portrait than a plot-driven crime story,Mean Streetsremains one of Scorsese's most direct and fascinating films--a masterful calling card for a director whose greatness was clearly apparent from that point forward.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790733927", "6302842263", "630026887X", "B000005PPB", "6302816629", "6301564456"], "also_viewed": ["6302066891", "6303534368"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 426972}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6304457375", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CA63GNNXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mean Streets [VHS]"}

It excitingly recreates the early life of a little girl who dreamed big, hit the road in the band bus named Big Bertha and whose concerts became electrifying events.

{"description": "It may not be a disaster movie, per se, but this terminally silly thriller is certainly disastrous, and would be pointless without the novelty of its setting in a flooding Midwestern town during a torrential rainfall. Physically impressive but idiotic in every other respect, the movie pits an armored truck courier (Christian Slater) against a smart leader of thieves (Morgan Freeman) and a corruptible town sheriff (Randy Quaid) who are vying for possession of $3 million in cash. A waterlogged game of cat and mouse, the plot is so contrived that even the most impressive action sequences--such as a jet-ski chase through flooded high-school corridors--are robbed of their already tenuous credibility. Before long you'll be yawning as incompetent accomplices are systematically dispatched by their own stupidity, in the kind of movie where the use of power boats inevitably leads to at least one death by outboard motor. What's impressive here is the physical production itself--the effect of flooding was created by building a huge replica of downtown Huntington, Indiana, in a huge, watertight aircraft hangar in Palmdale, California!--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300183211", "B00003CXE6", "6303486746", "6301888901", "6304078250", "6301643410", "6302945135"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 434625}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6305017271", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5186Z7DBGQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hard Rain [VHS]"}

{"description": "It's no secret thatBuffycreator Joss Whedon was unhappy with the hilariously campy and  charming 1992 film about his vampire-slaying heroine. When the opportunity for the Warner Brothers series came  along, he set out to presenthiscomplete vision of the teen dream. This set is a nice introduction to Buffy (petite and pretty Sarah Michelle Gellar); her watcher Rupert Giles (Anthony Stewart Head); her best friend, the computer whiz Willow (winning Alyson Hannigan); their devoted but slightly goofy friend Xander (Nicholas Brendon), and the self-involved beauty Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter). Also featured is Buffy's angst-ridden, 240-year-old beau-to-be, Angel (David Boreanaz). Sunnydale, where former Los Angelean Buffy now resides, just happens to be at a Hellmouth opening, allowing for the presence of not only vampires, but all kinds of beasties and demons. This keeps Buffy and her posse very busy.The two-part opener, \"Welcome to Hellmouth\" and \"Harvest,\" introduces Buffy and audiences to  her new high school, her friends, and her enemies. Most importantly, the episodes introduce a demon who'll plague her through the series' first season: the Master. She also meets Angel, the most beleaguered vampire this side of Lestat's Louis. Together, the newfound friends and the watcher  battle--and win (for now)--against the Master's minions. \"The Witch\" is an early example of the demons Buffy faces--it's not just about staking vamps.  Here Buffy meets Amy (a recurring character), whose mother is a cheerleader-obsessed--you guessed it--witch. \"Never Kill a Boy on the First Date\" explores a recurring theme: Buffy's thwarted attempts for normalcy in her life. As viewers come to expect, demons get in the way. Here, the Anointed One (a kiddie vamp) is crowned. Buffy learns the true identity of the mysterious and handsome Angel, who's spent the last 80 years without a kill. The couple agree not to pursue a relationship (yeah, right). Another episode that explores the demonic is \"The Puppet Show,\" which borrows from the familiar theme of the possessed ventriloquist's dummy. Some episodes are quite graphic (\"The Puppet Show,\" for example, features a potential brain removal), but there's always the inevitable triumph of good over evil. This justifiably popular phenomenon serves up healthy messages of loyalty and friendship, complete with hip, dead-on funny dialogue and great clothes. It's also a celebration of the quirky and the odd(balls).--N.F.

Upon her return to New York, Sabrina is transformed into a sophisticated woman, and David is entranced by her. However, his older brother Linus (Humphrey Bogart) has arranged David's marriage to Elizabeth Tyson in order to seal a business merger and thus must steer David away from Sabrina. To do this, Linus takes on the task of wooing her for himself. Full of great dialogue (\"A woman happy in love, she burns the souffl&eacute;; a woman unhappy in love, she forgets to turn on the oven\") and wonderful performances, this film is a romantic masterpiece. Also enjoyable is the 1995 remake, starring Julia Ormond and Harrison Ford.--Jenny Brown", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00BTYU3ZS", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00AMEZDK6", "B002HK9IDQ", "B00005ALMH", "B00AEFXLBQ", "B004IK30KA", "B006TTC5WC", "B008CZDVUQ", "B0087ZG7OI", "B0002B15YM", "B000RZGIPY", "B00AEBB97S", "B000WTVZHQ", "B00EL6ABL2", "B00006JU7S", "B000E1MXSW", "B000AP04MO", "B002TSAAME", "B0002B15Y2", "B00009NHC5", "B00AEBB89C", "6305999872", "B00871C09S", "B00EL6A8ZG", "B00EL6A7XE", "B0009SC790", "B000JF5TXO", "B0045HCJQW", "B00GY71GJC", "B000CNESN0", "B00HVOFPD0", "B0002ERWZ0", "B00EL6A8IS", "B002VWNIAY", "B0041KXMO6", "B00I5E95PY", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B0045HCJJY", "B0013LPRTE", "B0045HCJ9E", "B00H0EN9CK", "B00AEFXD1O", "B00005A06N", "B001D8W7EK", "B00003Q433", "B0010AN7Z4", "B0008ENICU", "B002LVF2H2", "B0017I3S30", "B00ALTQRUC", "B000PKG6OE", "B00HW3EZXQ", "B003ZEQMH8", "B0090XLDKY", "B00CZ7AL32", "B004GJYR7I", "B000MGTQ7K", "B00AEFXUL2", "B00HYRYNH8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BTYU3ZS", "B00AEBB8YW", "B002HK9IDQ", "B00AEFXLBQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 422488}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6305110859", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4146E7JT7RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sabrina"}
{"description": "Showdown in Little Tokyois a 1991 martial arts action-comedy that, in pitting Dolph Lundgren and Brandon Lee as L.A. cops against Japanese drug dealers, plays like a B-movieTango and CashorLethal Weapon 2(both released just two years before). Between career highs inRocky IV(1985) andUniversal Soldier(1992), Lundgren looked as if he might make it big at the box office, and clearly wanting to be the new Schwarzenegger he is here directed by Mark L Lester, who had earlier helmed Ah-nold'sCommando(1985). In the event both actor and director headed for straight-to-video territory, while Lee (Bruce's son) went on toThe Crow. The 75-minute running time suggests the studio lost confidence and seriously cut the movie though, as the space between the action is filled with nothing but cringe-inducing dialogue, thriller clich&#xE9;s, and Lundgren \"romancing\" Tia Carrere, it still makes sense. Basing its title on John Carpenter's 1986 fantasy-comedyBig Trouble in Little Chinaand anticipatingRush Hour(1998),Showdown in Little Tokyoalternates between crude tongue-in-cheek moments and action so ludicrous it's unintentionally hilarious .

{"description": "Solid entertainment from a new group of Disney animators. The story  source is a Chinese fable about a young girl who disguises herself as a man to help her family and her country. When the Huns attack China, a call to arms goes out to every village, and Mulan's father, being the only man in the family, accepts the call. Mulan (voiced by Ming-Na Wen, sung by Lea Salonga) has just made a disastrous appearance at the Matchmaker and decides to challenge society's expectations (being a bride). She steals her father's conscription notice, cuts her hair, and impersonates a man to join the army. She goes to boot camp, learning to fit in with the other soldiers with some help from her sidekick, Mushu, a wise-cracking dragon (voiced by Eddie Murphy). She trains, and soon faces the Huns eye-to-eye to protect her Emperor.The film is gorgeous to look at, with a superior blend of classic and computer-generated animation. Directors Tony Bancroft and Barry Cook make the best of it: a battle in the snowy mountains is as thrilling as the best Hollywood action films. The menacing Huns are not cute but simple and bad. The wickedness is subtle, not disturbing. The film is not a full-fledged musical, as it has only five songs (the best, \"Be a Man,\" is sung during boot camp). Eddie Murphy is an inspired choice for the comic-relief dragon, but his lines are not as clever as Robin Williams's inAladdin. These are minor quibbles, though. The story is strong, and Mulan goes right to the top of Disney animated heroines; she has the right stuff.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["0788805843", "6302787068", "B000035Z2S", "0788812408", "6303314015", "6302526574", "0788803743", "0788802194", "6304401132", "078881172X", "6304290888", "155890641X", "0788806270", "6302320402", "B00005JKDQ", "0788812807", "6304500831", "6300274268", "6302642248", "0788805533", "6304089767", "B0000AQZYM", "6303983812", "B00003CXQX", "6305326940", "6302178924", "6305319138", "6304100507", "6300274195", "B00005JL95", "6300275310", "6302961572", "B00003CX7L", "6305940932", "6304400551", "6304089201", "6304501153", "0788811002", "B00005RDVV", "6303534422", "6302158095", "6303929338", "6301390725", "B0002YLCHE", "6303036813", "B0002YLCH4", "6304978286", "B0000E32WB", "6304873441", "B00004R99I", "B00004R99N", "B00003CXHR", "B00016JF2W", "6304400225", "B00000ICHA", "B0000524CZ", "B00005JKX3", "0788812440", "B00005T7H6", "1558906150", "B00003CXXI", "6301991311", "6302426200", "B00006IUM9", "B00009L4S1", "B000035Z46", "B00007AJLB", "B00003CWPW", "6303122647", "6300274608", "B00000J2JA", "B0009SUS4Q", "B00003CXG6", "0788812181", "B00006CXK5", "0783228503", "B00005JLR1", "6305177473", "B0001I55VK", "0788810634", "0788809806", "6301404440", "B000063V8N", "6305942285", "6304401736", "6304117752", "B00008Y47S", "B000028U3S", "0790748266", "6303392350", "078880720X", "B000009CTR", "6302484359", "B0007A2GSM", "6303939015", "B00003CXQ6", "B00000JS61", "0783236689", "B00006L97W"], "bought_together": ["0788805843", "6302787068"], "also_viewed": ["0788812408", "6303314015", "6302787068", "0788805843", "B000035Z2S", "0788802194", "155890641X", "6302320402", "6302526574", "B0000AQZYM", "6302642248", "6304401132", "6304290888", "6304089767", "B0007KTBIU", "6304500831", "0788805533", "B00005JKDQ", "0788806270", "0788812807", "078881172X", "6305319138", "6302961572", "6300274195", "6303929338", "6300274268", "6305940932", "6302178924", "B00004R99N", "B00005JL95", "6305326940", "6304100507", "6304089201", "6303983812", "B00003CX7L", "B00005RDVV", "6304400551", "6303534422", "6304501153", "B00003CXQX", "6300275310", "B00016JF2W", "B00AO686JC", "6304978286", "6303036813", "6304401736", "B00003CXHR", "0788812440", "6302158095", "B0000E32WB", "B00003CXXI", "B0002YLCHE", "0788811002", "B000035Z46", "B00004R99I", "B00000ICHA", "6303122647", "6302426200", "B00006CXK5"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 75871}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.98, "brand": "", "asin": "6305229449", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513PCT8QM5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mulan [VHS]"}
{"description": "Saturday Night Feverit's not--call it more likeSunday  Morning Leftovers. This portrait of the legendary Manhattan disco and its colorful cofounder, Steve Rubell, plays like the outtakes of a much more interesting film--where's the sex, the drugs, the classic disco music? (It shouldn't surprise viewers that Miramax and writer-director Mark Christopher had a falling-out over the final cut of the film; Miramax prevailed.) Considering that the essence of Studio&nbsp;54 was about the rich and beautiful, it seems a bit unwise to focus on the poor and  only-somewhat-beautiful, namely Shane (Ryan Phillippe), a Jersey boy who gets taken in by the razzle-dazzle of the disco era. Crossing the river, Shane finds another, more exciting life at Studio&nbsp;54 as a shirtless bartender, and soon finds himself partying with the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me--and  smitten with comely soap star Julie (Neve Campbell). The permutations of the story are familiar; if you've never seen VH1'sBehind the Musicdocumentary take on Studio&nbsp;54 you'll find this film enjoyable, but unlike that exhaustive portrait, too many elements are missing. Most of Phillippe's performance seems to have ended up on the cutting-room floor (although his chiseled torso gets maximum exposure), Campbell's role is basically a glorified cameo, and Breckin Meyer and Salma Hayek, as Phillippe's only true pals, are wasted. The one true gem of the film, though, is Mike Myers's take on the late Steve Rubell, an inspired high-wire performance that balances humor and tragedy without ever giving in to camp or pathos. Had this been a more well-received movie, he'd be remembered come Oscar time--his drunken proposition of Philippe is a minor treasure. The soundtrack does feature some unknown chestnuts and a few new remixes, including an inspired disco version of--believe it or not--Gordon Lightfoot's \"If You Could Read My Mind.\"--Mark Englehart", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 272112}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6305210144", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71Z4BW48N8L._SY300_.gif", "title": "54 [VHS]"}

{"description": "A high-profile action/exploitation thriller set in the present,The Siegeis really a fantasy that extrapolates from major terrorist attacks. Denzel Washington is FBI special agent Hubbard, \"Hub\" to his friends, whose anti-terrorist task force must track down the terrorist cells responsible for a spate of bombings in New York.  His partner is an FBI agent of Arabian extraction (played convincingly by Tony Shalhoub), proving not all Arabs are bad guys--a point the film should be lauded for making again and again. Thrown into the mix is a CIA spy (played almost kittenish at times by Annette Bening), whose ties to the terrorists appear to be at the center of the conflicts.  When the bombings escalate out of control, the President institutes martial law, sending in General Devereaux (played with impenetrable countenance by Bruce Willis) with tanks and troops to ferret out the terrorists. Echoes of Japanese-Americans in internment camps ring out as Arabs, including the son of the Arab-American FBI agent, are herded into a stadium.  Periodic audio-montages of \"man in the street\" sentiments anchor the material in the present and show how serious and relevant the material is.  But finally what we have is a taut and entertaining popcorn movie, giving itself the humanistic nod when it can.--Jim Gay", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000244GCC", "B00005JA9F", "6304765258", "6304884400", "B0006210ZG", "B0000VJG72", "B00BTYOYG2", "B002GHHHN8", "0783240295", "6305428115", "B00005JPD0", "B002LMV7R0", "B002AT8K9W", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B000GFLKF8", "0790732149", "0790736411", "B005LAIGRS", "B0000542CJ", "0767818075", "078324228X", "B00015YVDG", "B00096S49Y", "B00003CXGV", "B002NZK5UU", "B0001VTPUO", "B00441GZ1Y", "B000Y7WGOW", "B000B8GT92", "0783226888", "B002CPMB9O", "B00003CXHJ", "B00005JN0W", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B003BV8I3Q", "0800141806", "B00005JKWX", "B002ZG99TA", "B00AFEXRME", "B002AT8KA6", "B00HLTD3ZW", "0767807588", "B000NTMA0Q", "B0050MB4OO", "B00005JKBC", "0800177967", "B000095WW8", "B002VWNIEA", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00JA3RVG4", "B00IARA8KM", "B003L20IG0", "B00HEPC0TS", "B00005JL8F", "6304711891", "B003ASLJIQ", "B000G5SILC", "B00009L1TA", "B00BEIYHO2", "B00125WAWS", "B002NZK5VO", "B00AEFYF2K", "0790732238", "B00005JLRZ", "B009HIKAN8", "0790730979", "B00A2H9P98", "B00015HVJM", "B008JFUNKU", "B00AEFYENK", "B0000549B2", "B0045HCJFS", "630514415X", "B00J2MPZQG", "B0002V7OI8", "B000XT1P4S", "B002O3Z4WK", "B00000JDIQ", "0792159659", "6305310335", "6304779631", "B00011CZRE", "B0007KIFGE", "0767817745", "B000N60HAO", "B001N44BVQ", "0783230532", "B000056VP4", "B00CHMBQRA", "B000ENC5YW", "B00008K76U", "B002AS464Q", "B00AIBZMD6", "B001B3LIOC", "6304698747", "B00JU949TK", "0767836286", "0767802578", "B00562I40K", "B00005JN2Z"], "bought_together": ["6304765258", "B00005JA9F"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JKWX", "B00005JPD0", "0783240295", "B000GFLKF8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 115396}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 17.63, "brand": "", "asin": "6305364206", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512E39F1JAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Siege"}

And Barrymore decided, as producer, that the perfect actress to play this virtuous, clean-cut, and downright annoying geek would be... Drew Barrymore?

{"description": "Patrice Chereau, the acclaimed French director of opera and theater, follows his grand period dramaQueen Margotwith this gorgeous but jagged portrait of dysfunctional adults and broken relationships in contemporary Paris. A group of old acquaintances whose friendships have become strained over the years reunite for the funeral of their mentor. Chereau drops us in the midst of things from the opening moments, leaving us to sort out the layered editing and rich soundtrack while catching up with a story that keeps leaping forward. The widescreen film is shot with a handheld camera, and the jittery, nervous energy and abrupt editing wind up the already tense atmosphere. But even as Chereau eases up from the uncomfortably in-your-face intimacy of the claustrophobic opening scenes on the train, emotions ooze like open wounds and unresolved conflicts bubble over. Former French idol Jean-Louis Trintignant, who has aged into an awesomely understated performer and a fascinating screen presence, leads a cast of edgy young actors, includingQueen Margotstars Vincent Perez (as a depressed transsexual) and Pascal Greggory (as the group's tentative spokesman). It's a sharp, intelligent, restless film that recalls such recent French dramas asLate August, Early SeptemberandMy Sex Life (or How I Got into an Argument). It doesn't offer any clear story or easy resolution, just a messy but potent portrait of the crossed lives of adults still looking for themselves.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000267776", "B000ICL3NS", "B00009V2IP", "B0000BWVD9", "B00HRISNPM", "B00GHP8SH4", "B00HHYF5EI", "B0007R4TMG", "B004AYMY92", "B00DJYJTG0", "B0001A79A8", "B00125WASM", "B00B81NPGQ", "B000CNER3Q", "B000E6ESQW", "B000GLL1XS", "B0040Y5K8O", "B00BSHYZGY", "B00002SWE3", "B008KJVKPW", "B0009PW45K", "B0002VYOYK", "B000053V5P", "B004THJ3BC", "B0000DJYNI", "B0047UJBNQ"], "bought_together": ["B000267776"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004AYMY92", "B004N21KIC", "B000SUKPL6", "B000OVLC0W"]}, "price": 16.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 272120}, "asin": "6305811555", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512P9EYNYYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Those Who Love Me Can Take the Train"}

{"description": "Generally acknowledged as a bona fide classic, this Francis Ford Coppola film is one of those rare experiences that feels perfectly right from beginning to end--almost as if everyone involved had been born to participate in it. Based on Mario Puzo's bestselling novel about a Mafia dynasty, Coppola'sGodfatherextracted and enhanced the most universal themes of immigrant experience in America: the plotting-out of hopes and dreams for one's successors, the raising of children to carry on the good work, etc. In the midst of generational strife during the Vietnam years, the film somehow struck a chord with a nation fascinated by the metamorphosis of a rebellious son (Al Pacino) into the keeper of his father's dream. Marlon Brando played against Puzo's own conception of patriarch Vito Corleone, and time has certainly proven the actor correct. The rest of the cast, particularly James Caan, John Cazale, and Robert Duvall as the rest of Vito's male brood--all coping with how to take the mantle of responsibility from their father--is seamless and wonderful.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["630021639X", "6302158176", "6300183211", "6304214502", "6300214826", "0790705141", "6303168507", "0790733927", "B00003CXE6", "630470786X", "6300267997", "0790741512", "6303471501", "6300271331", "6302054982", "6303686796", "B00005PJ8I", "B00004COR2", "0792842111", "6304258984", "6304509146", "0783216084", "6300215644", "6300216500", "B000062XM6", "0800199421", "B0002F6BQU", "0800116917", "630336568X", "6304508611", "B00000F13T", "6304935811", "6305363668", "B000005PFL", "6300182878", "0792116887", "6300182452", "B00005B238", "0792845684", "6300247171", "0792839846", "6302482712", "6302989787", "0790732017", "0800100832", "630442972X", "6304196954", "B000065U6Q", "6301208773", "B00000K2SC", "6302842263", "6304429274", "6303313345", "B0000A36J1", "B000059XY5", "079212569X"], "bought_together": ["630021639X", "6302158176"], "also_viewed": ["6302610702", "630021639X", "6301792734", "6303402348", "6300215830", "6304117752", "6300183211", "6302158176", "B00COYZF5A", "6300214060", "B000NTPDSW", "6305095566", "0792151712", "6305169187", "6303953425", "080010367X", "6302054982", "6301208773", "B000KX0ISG", "630310696X", "6302415853", "6304214502", "B00005B238", "6303168507", "B00E9PMMX0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 270877}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.98, "brand": "", "asin": "B000003KHS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/11KQ3QC757L.jpg", "title": "The Godfather [VHS]"}

{"description": "Set in the Little Italy neighborhood of Montreal,Mambo Italianois  a fresh and enjoyable take on gay relationships. After reconnecting with  an estranged childhood friend, Angelo (Luke Kirby) discovers that he and  Nino (Peter Miller) have more in common than just their Italian heritage  and suffocating families. After they move in together, Angelo finds that  he can't stand being in the closet any longer--but Nino, who's a cop and  much more attached to passing as straight, resists. After Angelo tells his  parents (Ginette Reno and Paul Sorvino), their lives explode and Angelo  discovers that coming out may cost him everything he held dear. The  emphasis on ethnic humor threatens to turnMambo ItalianointoMy Big Gay Italian Wedding, but the clever writing, sprightly  performances, and inventive direction keep the movie consistently  unpredictable and funny. Also featuring Claudia Ferri as Angelo's neurotic  sister.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006GVJEY", "B0000639HT", "B0001HAGRE", "B0000560PU", "B0042KZJFA", "B0002I84JO", "B00008UALE", "B004XKUFY4", "B0013D8LCW", "B00005QAQD", "B00996RSYM", "B0080JX4Y2", "B0062QHZJU", "0780629167", "B00CMQIDKY", "B000BZISX0", "B00GWWV1XU", "B001Y7CVXC", "B00E849QSG", "B00F98FOPE", "B000WDVNMO", "B00HUQCA28", "1573624381", "B002PCVLWW", "B004L03B3S", "B00FGG60XY", "B0096UG7XY", "B0084BM7NK", "B00GSA3K6C", "B00EU8RB14", "B00GHP8SH4", "B006FYYWQS", "B00FPVGWY2", "B007OXB1GI", "B0000DD75N", "B00HHYF5EI", "B008JFX04G", "B000HWXPXK", "B0083V2VYG", "B00118S6CY", "B00E99FYOK", "B0042L0OFE", "B00004UEDZ", "B009J212G6", "B000NVT0UM", "B000FTJ74Q", "B00CC2V7AQ", "B005OTQIK8", "B008N25X7M", "B003IG06PM", "B000HLDFMM", "B008BKQZNW", "6305744777", "B00008R9KD", "B002SSNFUO", "B005TIK4SQ", "B000VKJ6UE", "B00DUJH94S", "B005GM38MO", "B0001V6ZK2", "B000SQJ28C", "B00HUTPKA4", "B0010X740U", "B000UNYJOK", "B001AOC9K4", "B00G3MXSW6", "B00005JOFQ", "B006GGREO2", "B002ZG9800", "B005C6BGVY", "B00005JN1K", "B000CR7R7K", "B007L6JQ3S", "B00GB0ORJ8", "B009SFR2QI", "B000HC2M16", "B00IA7MFEO", "B006VJI6IM", "B00B2DGYQS", "B004KA1DGG", "B00HQKREFG", "B00F878KAC", "B0000714BP", "B0000541AI", "B002VECLVO", "B000092T3P", "B00564HZYY", "B00006FDBN", "B001NGNLEW", "0792833198", "B005GM38NI", "B00JESQSY6", "B00DUJH8V2", "B00JJRLG7G", "B00006ADD6", "B0000JD29M", "B0099PW0D2", "0889224943"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000639HT", "B0006GVJEY", "B00FGG60XY", "B00E99FYOK"]}, "price": 7.88, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 34927}, "asin": "B00000F5B5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515itlC6YoL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mambo Italiano"}

{"description": "Rondo Hatton had appeared briefly in such Hollywood classics asThe Hunchback of Notre DameandThe Ox-Bow Incident, but his later status as a cult icon is kept alive by his roles in low-budget B&nbsp;thrillers. His massive, misshapen head, gigantic hands, and towering presence were the result of acromegaly, a disease that causes bones to be enlarged and misproportioned.The Brute Manwas Hatton's last film and only headlining role--he died soon after filming. He stars as the Creeper, a mysterious killer taking his revenge on those he holds responsible for the accident that disfigured him, but whose heart is softened by a blind girl who befriends him--kind of a twisted take onBeauty and the Beast. The slapdash production suffers from an underwritten script and lackluster performances, but director Jean Yarbrough manages to inject some mood and a little style into the production, and even pulls a few surprises out of the otherwise mundane script. Tom Neal, who appears as the Creeper's next target, made his cult reputation withDetour. Hatton was never much of an actor, but he makes a startling presence shuffling through fog-shrouded streets and ducking around corners, and even elicits a little sympathy for a character so filled with hate that he becomes the monster he resembles.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003ZS2WXW", "B000FWHW90", "B000WNHTCC", "B00FERT0PK", "B003ZK7HK8", "B000TLTCT0", "B000FWHW8Q", "B00D9EJFV4", "B000E991DE", "B000E8JO32", "B0000694WM", "B00005LC4O", "B00000ILEU", "B0000APVC5", "B00D9EJFZA", "B00005LC4N", "B003ZJYYPA", "B0047O2FOO", "B0013XZ6SY", "B000BYA5IC", "B001BSBBMQ", "B001EXE2Y2", "B00358MG8S", "B00008J2EM", "B0046D4EI6", "B00005B6KK", "B0052SO06U", "B000067IW1", "B00007G1TI", "B0000A2ZU4", "B005OT829S", "6305907595", "B005OK0YQG", "B00004Y7HP", "B00006L90W", "B00008G96N", "0786429747", "B000087F20", "B002C1EFZ6", "B00APNJ8IC", "B000787YRW", "6305808198", "B000005LBW", "6305636435", "B000AM6OEY", "B000BKVS7I", "B008B8AOIQ", "B000AV2GT2", "B001U91AY0", "B001UIFQWI", "B000QTD5XE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000WNHTCC", "B003ZJYYPA", "B003ZS2WXW", "B003ZK7HK8"]}, "price": 14.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 296403}, "asin": "B00000IYR2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DC76BGS6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Brute Man"}
{"description": "EDITOR'S NOTE: According to a Warner Home Video technician involved in  the production ofThe Stanley Kubrick Collection, Kubrick authorized all aspects of theCollection, from the use of Digital Component Video (or \"D-1\") masters originally approved in 1989, to the use of minimalist screen menus, chapter stops, and (in the case of2001: A Space OdysseyandThe Shiningon DVD) supplementary materials. Full-screen presentation ofThe ShiningandFull Metal Jacketwas also approved by Kubrick, who recomposed his original framing,  reportedly believing that those films looked best on video in the full-screen format. (In fact, the original theatrical aspect ratio ofThe Shiningwas 1.66:1, meaning that a relatively small portion of the image is lost.) Kubrick also chose mono over stereo,  believing that inconsistencies in theatrical sound systems resulted in loss of control over theatrical presentation. In every respect, the Warner spokesman  said, the films in theCollectionremain as Kubrick approved them. Any future attempt to remaster or alter them would  have to be approved by an appointee of the Kubrick estate.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00366F2NU", "B000UJ48SQ", "0792841409", "B005152C9G", "B000055Y0X", "B0013D8LKO", "0783226039", "B004L9GMBC", "B00005ATQB", "0792841387", "B007K8ILTW", "B000P0J09C", "B0000AUHQ6", "B000063JDE", "B002VWNIDG", "B001IHJ988", "B000EBD9TE", "B000EBD9SU", "B000UJCAKY", "B001FOK70S", "0679727299", "B00005JKJA", "B00004TWZH", "B00006RCNV", "B001LXIDUY", "0679723161", "6305999872", "B0087ZG7OI", "B00DW5IKYS", "B008RO875Q", "B0045HCJ94", "B0013FSXT6", "B00005JKGX", "B00AEBB89C", "B0087ZG7UW", "0767830555", "B0020LH8WU", "B0050FXDDQ", "B0057UA486", "B0045HCJ8U", "B000UJCAKO", "B0009S4J3M", "B0041KKYEM", "B001152TL6", "B00009W5CA", "B00C3ALLDA", "B00AEFXN9G", "B001FZQOW2", "B00000IREA", "B0000DJZ8Q", "B00005U2KC", "B0087ZG7R0", "B0010AN7Z4", "B007Y1NR1W", "B005Z9MGRG", "B00005QAPH", "B008BFSMBA", "B004NWPY20", "B00003CXBU", "B00AEFXESQ", "B007Y1NNAW", "B00079Z9VO", "B00K8HAIAW", "B003ELKNH2", "B0082CWTSY", "B001TIQT70", "B00062IVM6", "B005KQVE1S", "0783230559", "B0000549B1", "B000CNESU8", "B00004XPPK", "B00008RH3J", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B000QQFKYE", "B000EXDSCA", "B00AEFYSEA", "B00009MEKJ", "B000VLCRCW", "B002VWNICC", "B003VA3JTK", "B0045HCJ9O", "B00003CXCF", "078323502X", "B0010YVCI4", "B00BTYU3SK", "B00006ADD5", "B002LYD2MG", "B006TTC5HC", "B0009A40ES", "B00026L8US", "B008MIMWP8", "B0000DI87S", "B003O7I6SE", "B009POCG0Y", "B00000CQJZ", "B000G8NXYG", "B001PYD0LG", "6304907729"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00366F2NU", "B000UJ48SQ", "B0013D8LKO", "B000UJ48T0"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 158378}, "asin": "B00000J2KV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/714ZK0VSVBL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Lolita"}

{"description": "In the opening minutes ofCoffy, Pam Grier's star-making role,  she blasts the skull of a sleazy drug pusher into pulp like a watermelon and  shoots his junkie assistant with an overdose of heroin. Jack Hill knows how to  open a movie, and he never lets up on the down-and-dirty action. Coffy is an  emergency room nurse by day and vigilante by night, targeting the dealers who  made her sister a comatose junkie. She works her way up to the Italian mobsters  muscling into the ghetto drug trade while she's romanced by glib, smooth-talking  politician Booker Bradshaw and wooed by nice-guy cop William Elliot, whose  refusal to sell out to the corrupt force earns him a crippling  beating.There's plenty of sex, a catty girl-fight that leaves the losers  topless, and car chases and shootouts galore, but what makesCoffya  blaxploitation classic is Grier's Amazonian presence and fiery charisma, and the  gritty, low-budget action scenes marked by visceral, wincing violence. Mob  strong-arm Sid Haig (Spider Baby) cackles while dragging his victim (a  strutting peacock pimp played byNashville's Robert DoQui) behind a  speeding car in a sadistic lynching, and Grier runs down one bad guy with a  speeding car and takes care of another with a shotgun to the groin. Hill had  previously directed Grier inThe Big Doll HouseandThe Big Bird  Cage. Their next and last picture together,Foxy Brown, was  originally written as the sequel toCoffy.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300269825", "0792841972", "0792841980"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 656549}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.95, "brand": "", "asin": "B000035P6Z", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5141VRHWMCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Coffy [VHS]"}

{"description": "Road Tripis a mostly agreeable, by-the-numbers teen flick with a  handful of inspired sequences, most of them involving MTV's resident disturbed  soul, Tom Green. It concerns a sleepy University of Ithaca student named Josh  (Breckin Meyer) who accidentally mails a video of his sexual encounter with an  infatuation (Amy Smart) to his longtime girlfriend (Rachel Blanchard), who's  seemingly avoiding him while at school in Austin, Texas. Naturally, he recruits  some buddies--Seann William Scott as the lech, D.J. Qualls as the hopeless nerd,  and Paulo Costanzo as the doper genius--to hit the open highway and intercept  the package. Even more naturally, mayhem ensues: A car explodes, a bus is  stolen, a nerd is deflowered, French toast is horribly violated, and an elderly  man bogarts both pot and Viagra.The film's humor is more democratic than politically correct, as everyone--women  and minority characters, not just the hipster white guys--have a hand in the  high jinks. Green plays Barry Manilow (no, not that one), a professional student  (eight years and counting)--he relates the film's story to skeptical prospective  students while leading them on a tour of the college--and thrill-seeking dork  extraordinaire. In particular, in an already justly famous sequence of scenes,  he sadistically anticipates and endeavors to accelerate a mouse's demise at the  jaws of a python. It's very much in the vein ofAmerican Pie, perhaps a  smidgen tamer, but at least its characters don't really learn any dopey lessons  in the end. Director and coscreenwriter Todd Phillips, who earlier made the  much-questioned documentaryFrat House, again proves he's more adept at  staging fictional comic sequences than real ones.--David Kronke", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFXVW0", "B00AEFYS2M", "B0023TCWE8", "B000069CF0", "B0009ZE9VW", "B00005JMX6", "B00003CXS7", "B000069HQ2", "B000JJ4DNW", "B0009P42WI", "B000IZJZIU", "B003TY2SPO", "B000EMGJAO", "B000BKVQS4", "B001OD4S50", "B00AEFZ3XU", "B002CLKV54", "B00005NTOH", "B005LAIH9A", "B000031WD9", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B000CPH9PM", "B00003CY6D", "B00024JC4E", "B00260HH1W", "B006WXHJLC", "B004SIP8ES", "B00005KA6V", "B0006GANPA", "B000LC3ICE", "B00IMYVCGW", "B003VPX5Y4", "B00AEFYSL8", "B00005JMCT", "B001G5T6GW", "B00003CXE4", "B001J9KJ4I", "B0009HBPN0", "B000WZEZGI", "B00068WOH8", "B00AEBBA2C", "B00005JKMN", "B00000F0AD", "0800141687", "B001L9EXTS", "B00AEFYAMA", "B0026BXHQ0", "B004I9SJH0", "B002FU8IWU", "B0051MKNRC", "B008220BGQ", "B001C0JCBA", "B000BKJ762", "B0000A02TZ", "B004EPYZS0", "B00007AJGM", "B000E6EHE0", "630529142X", "B000RJO56O", "B001DPHDB0", "B00005JL93", "B008R65XUQ", "B0002V7TMY", "B004LWZW5G", "B000BKJ758", "6305310254", "B00005JNZU", "B004EPZ06G", "B004EPZ084", "B0041KKYGU", "0783235070", "B000ELJAEM", "B000FP2OPO", "B00003CXO1", "B004SIP9CO", "B00441GZ1E", "B00003CXPS", "B000FS9UKI", "B000F9RLL2", "B002AS466O", "B00005JMDZ", "6305428549", "B00003CY5A", "6305433925", "B0001XAQ9Q", "B000063RQO", "B00049QJBG", "B003Y5H5B0", "B00081912E", "B002ZG99H2", "B00BTYNXJG", "B0006HBZE2", "B00441GYVA", "B00005JLQE", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00KNALRZ4", "0790730979", "B008R65XNS", "B008JFUORW", "B001KKU9DW"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFXVW0", "B000JJ4DNW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFXVW0", "B00AEFYS2M", "B000CPH9PM", "B004GTVU6O"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 59003}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.69, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00003CXIY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5142ge7XncL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Road Trip (Unrated Edition)"}

{"description": "Men of Honorpresents a great role model for younger viewers, yet it's rated R due to abundant use of theFword. With appropriate discretion, parents should allow their preteen and teenaged children to see this rousing if altogether conventional biopic inspired by the life of Carl Brashear. Played with gravity and gumption by Cuba Gooding Jr., Brashear was the first African American to become a master diver in the U.S. Navy, despite the lingering effects of segregation, opposition from Navy brass, and the amputation of his left leg following a tragic on-duty accident. Robert De Niro adds marquee value and salty bluster as Billy Sunday, the drunken, redneck (and fictionalized) Master Chief who watches, with gradual admiration, as Brashear attains his ultimate goal through sheer force of will.This is all quite uplifting on its surface, but in attempting to hit the requisite highlights of an inspiring biography, director George Tillman Jr. (Soul Food) reduces Brashear's achievement to a succession of clich&eacute;s, forcing Gooding and De Niro to battle sentiment with their noteworthy performances. As Sunday's neglected wife, Charlize Theron is completely extraneous; Hal Holbrook's diving-school commander is a ranting caricature; and newcomer Aunjanue Ellis barely registers as Brashear's wife (in part because their obligatory romance is handled with an utter lack of finesse). There's no question that Brashear's efforts are heroic and worthy of recognition, soMen of Honorserves its basic purpose. Still, one can't help but wonder if Brashear's story would be even more impressive with a more authentic treatment.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000KF0GWW", "B00005B6JZ", "B000F6IODE", "B00005JLRZ", "B00003CXGV", "6304765258", "1558908315", "B0007KIFGE", "B00319ECI8", "B00005JA9F", "B00125WAWS", "B0006L0L5C", "B000P0J0C4", "B000056VP4", "0790736411", "B000065U1N", "B005LAIGN2", "B00AEFYRP0", "B002NZK5VO", "B003ASLJOU", "B0002WZTOI", "B00005JPBO", "0790732238", "6305432317", "B00003CXHJ", "B00005N5S3", "B002VWNICM", "B002AT8K9W", "B002VECM6S", "B00067BCBI", "B00008EY60", "B00000G3PA", "B005LAIGYQ", "B00005JKTP", "B002D755AI", "B000095WW8", "B00AEFY5B6", "B0045HCJHQ", "B00AEFXOKO", "B00AEBB9NM", "B00003CXTG", "B000P0J0EM", "B00008K76U", "B00AEBBA36", "B00005JK8K", "B000KGGIZK", "0800177967", "B00026ZD04", "B000EXZFCQ", "B00003CXFV", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00004XPPG", "B004SIP7ZS", "0792159659", "B000E8QVWY", "B00005PJ8L", "B00AEFYENK", "B00005JLSB", "B00008L3S6", "B000P0J0CE", "B00001ZWUS", "B000P0J09C", "B0006GAOJA", "0451409744", "6304711891", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B00E8G5HZ0", "B002GHHHPQ", "B00441GZ1Y", "B000JYW5BE", "B00005Y1UX", "B001FB55L2", "0790730979", "0783226845", "0783240295", "B00004W221", "0783225733", "B00005JKWX", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B0045HCJ8K", "B00HLTD3ZW", "6305213305", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000SFOW8I", "B000EHSVSC", "B0006IIOHC", "B001QERPAC", "B000P0J0EW", "B004AOECXI", "0780631684", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B00096S49Y", "B0000542CK", "B000066HAS", "B000A2UBN4", "B0043X1FL8", "B00005JNQA", "B000059TFO", "B00003CXTM"], "bought_together": ["B000KF0GWW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CXRP", "B005LAIHXQ", "B00DV2MVWO", "B000KF0GWW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 125288}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.99, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B00003CXPP", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516WESMCF3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Men of Honor"}

{"description": "To callPearl Harbora throwback to old-time war movies is something of an understatement. Director Michael Bay's epic take on the bombing that brought the United States into World War II hijacks every war movie situation and clich&#xE9; (some affectionate, some stale) you've ever seen and gives them a shiny, glossy spin until the whole movie practically gleams. Planes glisten, water sparkles, trees beckon--and Bay's re-creation of the bombing itself, a 30-minute sequence that's tightly choreographed and amazingly photographed, sets the action movie bar up quite a few notches. And in updating the classic war film, Bay and screenwriter Randall Wallace (Braveheart) use that old plot standby, the love triangle--this time, it's between two pilots (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) and a nurse (Kate Beckinsale) who find themselves stationed at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, during what they thought would be a nice, sunny tour of duty. Then, of course, history intervened.For the first 90 minutes of the movie, Affleck and Beckinsale find a nice, appealing chemistry that plays on his strengths as a movie star and hers as a serious actress--he gives her glamour, she gives him smarts. Their truncated romance--the beginning of which is told in flashback so we can get right to the point where he has to leave her to go to England--works, thanks to their charm. They're no Kate and Leo fromTitanic(a strategy the film strives hard toward), but they're pretty darn adorable in their own right. Hartnett, as the not entirely unwelcome third wheel, squints bravely but makes only a slight dent in the film. Everyone else inPearl Harbor--from Cuba Gooding Jr.'s brave navy seaman to Jon Voight's able impersonation of FDR--is pretty much a glorified walk-on, taking a backseat to the pyrotechnics and action sequences that keep the three-hour film in fairly constant motion. But when that action does take hold,Pearl Harboris quite a thrilling ride.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792151712", "B000059HGY", "B00000K3AN", "B00AEBBA36", "0792133153", "079212569X", "6305169187", "6301734734", "0792147618", "0792116887", "6304618344", "079213690X", "6303269834", "6304925131", "6305718792", "6304259131", "B00004WIDB", "6304935811", "6303057225", "6304143184", "6302250269"], "bought_together": ["B00000K3AN", "B00AEBBA36"], "also_viewed": ["B00000G3PA", "0792151712", "6300213668", "B00000JS61", "6303215734", "6303402348", "B00004WIDB", "079213690X", "6305750750", "B004751DFU", "B00005O893", "B00000K3AN", "6301792734", "B00E5I2MCM", "6305169187", "B00007LVCM", "B007SPPANM", "B00L4K3MLE", "B00FLML7HW", "B008QZ5PY2", "B00JBGWP3Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 234413}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.49, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXTF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HC1ZDJN6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "Shot in the rough, 16-millimeter style of a low-budget documentary,Tigerlandmarked director Joel Schumacher's welcomed return to simplicity after a slew of bloated blockbusters likeBatman & Robin. In revitalizing Schumacher's directorial talent,Tigerland--partially inspired by the Danish Dogme 95 movement of no-frills filmmaking--suggested that one solution to Hollywood's moribund \"product\" was to abandon excess, focus on essentials, and assemble a fine cast of unknown actors to make it all worthwhile. To that end,Tigerlandalso marked the deserving arrival of Irish actor Colin Farrell as Hollywood's hottest new discovery.Its story never leaves U.S. soil, soTigerlanddiffers from such in-country Vietnam films asPlatoonandFull Metal Jacket. Instead, it's about the anxieties and moral dilemmas that arise from theanticipationof death and killing. These roiling emotions are focused on the character of Private Bozz (Farrell), whose insubordination betrays a singular knack for leadership during infantry training at Fort Polk, Louisiana, in 1971. Part R.P. McMurphy and part Cool Hand Luke, Bozz is a defiant maverick, barely tolerated by his superiors, challenged or revered by his fellow grunts, and ultimately honed into a soldier of remarkable promise. An intense final week in the live-ammo training ground nicknamed \"Tigerland\" galvanizes the platoon and Bozz's place in it, and although the film (partially based on cowriter Ross Klavan's own experience) lacks the emotional impact ofPlatoon, it deals quite potently with the internal conflicts that must be waged before external warfare can be endured.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003M987QK", "B000FIHN5M", "B0002Y4PPK", "B00005JLX2", "B00005JKTP", "B00005JLQN", "B001MZ5W3M", "B004C45AZU", "B006ISJQ26", "B0015D20FE", "B000MGB6NM", "B003LL3FIY", "B0013D8LC2", "B0018BD9DA", "B000J4QWMC", "B0002V7SOS", "B00005QW6V", "B00AEBBA36", "B000P0J09C", "B00008EYA5", "B000ELL1R6", "B003Y5H5FG", "B00005PJ8L", "B003ELKNH2", "079284646X", "B00AEBB86U", "B000DZIGDU", "B00005PJ8T", "B00005JK8K", "B00AEFY4IA", "1558908315", "B000N3SRO0", "B004SUDQCM", "B001BNFRB2", "B00I6JODGO", "B00CLH09UQ", "B00096S4BM", "B00003CXHJ", "B00005JKQS", "B00001ZWUS", "B000MRA542", "B00JA3RVG4", "B00009RDG9", "B00005PJ8K", "B0001NBMGC", "B00AEFXVCU", "B006TTC5HC", "B003M987AQ", "B00000F2UF", "B00096S4BW", "B00004WG2F", "B00005JA9F", "B00HOGBXS6", "B000R9U3B0", "B0001NBMHQ", "B004P7CMVE", "B002ZG97RE", "B00275EGWY", "B0045HCJ0S", "B00005BJWC", "B007REV4LQ", "6304711905", "B0007TKNLA", "B00001U0DU", "B000095WW8", "B000R4SMCW", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00AMSQBTY", "B00005JL78", "B00004ZBVG", "B000BRP4BM", "B00AEFYENK", "B004TPJN3C", "B000065U1N", "B00005BCKG", "B008JFUN50", "B00IKM5OCO", "B00J11U54K", "0792841662", "B00H1RMWYW", "B00096S4DA", "B000XR9L50", "B001ULAUF8", "B00004RF82", "B00005QBZA", "6304765258", "B005LAIIRQ", "B0001FVDIC", "B001AZW73M", "B000WMA6R8", "0792844017", "B003BV8ID6", "B00005BCKF", "B007S0DCUU", "B0008ENHTY", "B00004STDN", "B00003CXQG", "6304806434", "B004ZJZQGA", "B004P7CMOQ"], "bought_together": ["B003M987QK", "B000FIHN5M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0006HBZXS", "B004U7MQWY", "B00005JKTP", "0783222149"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 39744}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.66, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00003CXOY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41K9ZC8W0ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tigerland"}

{"description": "In the first season ofThe X-Files, creator Chris Carter was uncertain of the series' future, so each of the episodes is a self-contained suspense story; they do not delve deep into the ongoing X-Files mythology or turn to self-parody and humor as do episodes in later seasons. Yet, these episodes display the elements for which the show would become famous: the cinematic production values and top-notch special effects, the stark lighting of the Vancouver sets, the atmospheric halo of Mark Snow's score, and the clever plots dealing with subjects ranging from the occult, religion, and monsters to urban legends, conspiracy theories, and science fiction. Most importantly, season&nbsp;1 introduces FBI agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Fox \"Spooky\" Mulder (David Duchovny), two of the most attractive government officials around. Scully is the serious-minded medical scientist assigned to join Mulder on the X-Files, a division of the FBI dealing with the paranormal. Mulder is the intuitive thinker with a dry wit, a passionate believer in the existence of paranormal phenomena and one of the few characters on television smart enough to figure out who the bad guy is before the audience does. Their muddled relationship, a deep friendship laced with sexual tension, provides the human heart in a world where the bizarre and horrible lurk in everyday society.The materials on the bonus disc provide some interesting trivia and background, but it is the 24 episodes themselves that make this seven-disc boxed set a true find. Those unfamiliar withThe X-Filesoften view all the fuss with the same skepticism with which Scully first regards her new partner's ideas. But just as she comes to realize the uncanny accuracy of Mulder's outlandish theories, newcomers toThe X-Fileswho sample a few episodes in this boxed set will likely find themselves riveted to their television late into the night. And undoubtedly, the shadows and creaking noises in the house that evening will seem more menacing than usual.--Eugene Wei", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BOH98G", "B000BOH990", "B000CNE0SS", "B000CNE0T2", "B000CNE0TC", "B000EXDS34", "B000EXDS3E", "B000EXDS3Y", "B0007X7044", "B001G7PSZI", "B001FACH7S", "B0006UEVUE", "B001CY5N00", "B00005JA9M", "B0007ZEO7I", "B000002N3A", "B00CRVL5ZE", "B002GP7ZVY", "B00FXW9664", "B002GP7ZVO", "B000083C6V", "B00003CXIS", "B001G7PSSK", "B003V1IU3O", "B000ATQYWY", "B004X60QE2", "B000244E2O", "B0030E5PYO", "B002GP7ZV4", "B000NDEXK2", "B002ZCY872", "0792839056", "B0012CJQYG", "B0002I848K", "B000EBGFPY", "B000UX6THK", "B001C4CI8U", "B00BTYNXJG", "B00005JNOG", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B006BZ8NSE", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00465I156", "B000R7GKQE", "B0002PYS7Y", "B000F8O2Q0", "B000F8O2PQ", "B00466H3CW", "B0009X76XW", "B001T21R5U", "B00005Y1NF", "B000AQ68Z0", "B001BSBBGC", "B000063V8R", "B000BGR1B4", "B007C8RZQ0", "B002BWP2IK", "B0058JEHTS", "B002GP7ZW8", "B000667HBS", "B00DNUSFZQ", "B00CDAG0WW", "B00AEBB9AK", "B000FOPPBA", "B000056T4I", "B001FB4W0C", "B001KOFH2G", "B002JVWRAO", "B0009NZ2RE", "B004QOB8TS", "B000AJJNI6", "B0002ERWVE", "B00BM2JVAA", "0790742012", "B000VDDDY6", "B000F8O2OW", "B00HR2HTRQ", "B004YM6JI2", "B00005JNEQ", "B00003CXZ4", "B000FJH5M2", "B001MVWRNE", "0783225725", "B000EXDS7K", "B00019074O", "B000JLTRHW", "B003BNO9GO", "B001G0MFIS", "B0032JTV6A", "B000FIMG68", "B004LROMWU", "B00008972G", "B001DMVZJ4", "B0011UF79M", "B005FISBTO", "B001715A92", "B000P6YNSE", "B00009PY45", "B00BYNL8DU", "B008B4KVRE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00CRVL5ZE", "B000BOH990", "B000BOH98G", "B0007X7044"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 170142}, "asin": "B00003RQND", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G8JY0Q71L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The X-Files - The Complete First Season"}
{"description": "The first Brother Cadfael mystery to be released on DVD,The Virgin in the Icecaptures all of the elements that  make these adaptations of Ellis Peters's novels a perennial PBS favorite. The performances and sets bring 12th-century England to vivid life (although the series was actually filmed in Hungary). Derek Jacobi portrays Cadfael with a quiet authority and just the right edge of world-weariness one would expect from a Crusader turned monk. His search for two missing children and for the band of outlaws who brutally beat one of his fellow monks turns up intrigues and surprise twists that make this episode a captivating human drama as well as an expertly crafted mystery. From frictions within Shrewsbury Abbey to the ongoing war between Queen Maud and King Stephen,The Virgin in the Iceplunges viewers fully into Cadfael's world and all of its unexpected joys and perils.The DVD includes several minutes of audio comments by Derek Jacobi about taking on the role and the appeal of Cadfael.

{"description": "How bad were the 1980s in music? Not even jazz great Miles Davis could  escape the black hole. The decade that saw synthesizers and slick approaches  ruin pop music somehow caught the master trumpet player's ear and resulted in  one of Davis's poorest periods. Of course, Davis was lucky to even be alive  during the '80s, surviving sickness and drug abuse, and this hour-long  performance, shot during the 1985 Montreal Jazz Festival, shows a performer  looking happy just to be playing. Appearing thin and sickly, Davis and his six-piece fusion outfit run through six tunes, none coming close to the trumpet  player's past experimental achievements. Songs like \"One Phone Call\" are long,  metallic funk jams that nonetheless give Davis plenty of room to maneuver in  spirited solos, when the rhythm section and keyboards aren't drowning him out.  Davis also reinvents pop hits of the era--ballads like Michael Jackson's \"Human  Nature\" (fromThriller)  and Cyndi Lauper's \"Time After Time,\" but they come across more like soulless  \"smooth jazz.\" Still, on all of the numbers, if you can block out everything  else and simply focus in on Davis's trumpet, the aging great possessed the  ability to mesmerize, even in his down years. Despite the lack of terrific music  material, this DVD is wonderfully packaged. The Milestones Biographical Time  Line is a great source to introduce beginners to Davis's legacy, while the  extensive liner notes on each individual song performed in Montreal are equally  impressive.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00HSCDX70", "B001GBZEDA", "B00006ADE3", "B0014I7JZQ", "B00BF2RU46", "B004Z0P68W", "B001GBZEDU", "B00000FC7S", "B00069FKN2", "B00004YVGJ", "B00005MEWH", "B001VFM5X8", "B000024XGM", "B002TCHY4M", "B0020MST7W"], "bought_together": ["B0014I7JZQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00006ADE3", "B004Z0P68W", "B001GBZEDA", "B00007CVRL"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 349863}, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Jazz", "Jazz Fusion"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 29.75, "brand": "", "asin": "B00004UEEI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/413YN6S684L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Miles Davis - Live from the Montreal Jazz Festival"}

Hope produced the film and penned the original story.  The screenwriting duty went to long-time collaborator Edmund Beloin (My Favorite Brunette Road To Rio and The Lemon Drop Kid) and Dean Riesner (Dirty Harry and Play Misty For Me).  Behind the camera was Gerd Oswald who directed A Kiss Before Dying (1956) and the cult film Screaming Mimi co-starring Miss Ekberg.

{"description": "The hungry, haunted eyes of the voluptuous Daliah Lavi dominate  Mario Bava's kinky little ghost story. Set in a cavernous castle on a  lonely coast, it looks like something out of Roger Corman's Edgar Allen  Poe thrillers, at least at first. Christopher Lee is the bad sheep prodigal son who returns to the family manor. A sexual sadist whose proclivities  brought about the death of a young girl and sent him into exile, he  immediately lures his brother's wife (Lavi) into his sadistic games upon  his return. There's no shortage of suspects when he's found dead, a dagger  plunged into his neck (the same one his former lover killed herself with),  but when he returns as a gray-faced ghost Bava pushes the gothic  conventions and repressed sexual desires into delirious territory. It's one of the most psychologically compelling scripts in Bava's filmography, wracked  with mad passions and haunted with guilt, and he pushes the emotional  hysteria to the limits with lush style, surreal color, and gorgeous, often  perverse imagery. The film was drastically cut and renamedWhat!for its U.S. release.

{"description": "\"Only the gods see everything,\" cautions one scientist as Dr. James Xavier (Ray Milland) experiments with a formula that will allow the human eye to see beyond the wavelength of visible light. \"I am closing in on the gods,\" he responds with the hubris that is doomed to destroy his overreaching ambition. A mix of Greek tragedy and sci-fi potboiler, Roger Corman'sX: The Man with the X-Ray Eyes(simply identified asXin the eerie, odd opening credits) is a familiar tale of a scientist who risks everything to explore the unknown and is finally driven mad by, literally, seeing too much. Peeping through the clothes of comely women is all good adolescent fun until the gift becomes a nightmare as his sight rages out of control. The possibilities suggested in the hints of addiction and inconsistent bouts of megalomania remain tantalizingly unexplored in the unfocused script, and Corman's cut-rate special effects are often more hokey than haunting (the \"city dissolved in an acid of light\" that Xavier poetically describes becomes fuzzy photography through a series of color filters). Don Rickles offers a venal turn as a scheming carnival barker turned blackmailing con man, and Diana Van der Vlis is understanding as a sympathetic scientist who tries to rescue Xavier from his spiral into tortured madness, but in the tradition of Greek tragedy, he is doomed to be destroyed by the very gifts he desires.MGM's widescreen disc also features commentary by director-producer Corman.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305772142", "B00005AUK2", "B00D9EJFZA", "B001BSBBNK", "B00005R1O7", "B00465I1BK", "B0007R4T26", "B00518A70E", "B00D9EJFV4", "6305944288", "B0007R4T1C", "B00009PY4A", "B0000549B1", "B004QF71ZW", "6305869367", "B000063UR0", "B00D3DJH7S", "B0002V7O2Y", "B00009PY45", "B000UDGOBG", "6305761078", "B00DOZNGC2", "B000G28GHG", "B000EHSVJG", "B000FVQLKW", "B000OHZJGO", "B00DOZNI8Y", "B000059PPL", "B00023P4FQ", "B000AQKU72", "B001DQH91I", "B0007R4T3A", "B007Y1NNAW", "B00AEBB94G", "B0000542CN", "B000UAFDR0", "B000056NWI", "B00009PY4D", "B00DZP1C9K", "B0007R4SZY", "B003J216K4", "B00005O071", "B0002IQL8K", "B00027JYMG", "B00AEBB8VK", "B00AQ6J5YA", "0792846885", "B0009X770O", "B000AYELJ2", "B00JEZWRE4", "B00358MG8S", "B0016B6ZJW", "B000RXVNDI", "B0000648YD", "B005ETANC2", "B00000K3U3", "B0009X770E", "B0013XZ6SY", "B0000558NJ", "B00B2M7DKA", "B004QF71YS", "B000GRUQJW", "B00005K3OF", "B00005LC4K", "B00008973H", "B000RXVND8", "B00ITZXDDY", "B00CUKTHES", "B000T5O46C", "B00FGAKEEQ", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B005HIBWBG", "B0034PWPHY", "B000RXVNCY", "B003XF1VUC", "B00005LC4J", "B00J2PQYY0", "B005TMXXX0", "6305772711", "B0024FAG80", "B000O78KWE", "B001DB6J50", "B001BSBBIA", "6305869359", "B0007R4TR6", "B0024FAG2G", "B000EHSVJ6", "B00005NSXY", "B0007R4T08", "B000068TPE", "B002TSAAS8", "B0000694WH", "B00005K3O5", "B00CLIAACC", "B00AQ6J4XM", "B001AD54NE", "B00AEFXRWO", "B0045HCJ94", "B000B7MX7A", "B001B1Q3LM"], "bought_together": ["B00005AUK2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0016J5E5K", "6305772142", "B00D9EJFZA", "B00518A70E"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 114855}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.88, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005AUK1", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DR4WYBRPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "X - The Man With The X-Ray Eyes"}
{"description": "Antoine Fuqua (THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS, BAIT) turns up the intensity level with TRAINING DAY, a charged drama about police corruption in downtown Los Angeles. Ethan Hawke stars as Jake Hoyt, a well-intentioned young officer who thinks he's found his ticket to becoming a detective in the form of undercover officer Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Harris is a notorious figure in the streets and in the office. He also has the authority to make Jake's professional wishes come true, provided Jake is able to prove his worth on Alonzo's team. At first, Alonzo's blunt, carefree demeanor provides a shock to Jake's optimistic system, but as it becomes clear that Alonzo is dangerously out of control, Jake must decide whether or not to risk his future in the name of the law.\n\nWashington's performance as the evil, pragmatic detective is a sight to behold. He delivers his lines with a devilish ferocity that keeps the film bubbling throughout. Hawke slips into the role of the rookie everyman with ease, providing a good contrast to Washington's fiery presence. Former video director Fuqua completes the picture by casting musicians Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and Macy Gray in supporting roles.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792841778", "630268644X", "6303012140", "6300214826"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 428216}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.0, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005JKEC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/415AYTB1GNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Training Day [VHS]"}

His penchant for betting on the wrong teams leaves him owing several thousand dollars to very violent people, and he ends up coaching a children's baseball team to pay off his debt. The movie skimps a bit on process: the kids start out as terrible players and become better but we don't see how; Conor starts caring but we don't see why. As by-the-numbers movies go, though, it isn't a bad one. The young actors in the cast are talented and understated. Most of the kids' characters are only barely fleshed out by the script, but this keeps the movie from being hijacked by extra-cute mugging. Parents should be cautioned--this movie has some very violent scenes that will frighten young children, and swearing is depicted as precocious and adorable. Still, like a baseball game, it isn't a bad way to spend your time.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000KHYN9C", "B00004Y2R1", "B00AMEZDJW", "B00000JGHV", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B002O3Z4XY", "B00AEFXOKO", "B0000633U2", "6305505780", "B00005JPK8", "B004GJYROG", "B0012YYZDG", "B00009AOAX", "078324021X", "B00003CY51", "B00AEFYE08", "B002GIBVWA", "B00005M20J", "B00E1HIWU8", "B0006J28MI", "B005SQRYEG", "B001DJLD12", "B0007LLPXI", "630514415X", "B000068NNU", "B0000JBUHI", "B003VE9WTW", "B00AEFXHNI", "B00DW5IKW0", "B000089771", "B000BITV9W", "1558908390", "B0001MMGC2", "B000089778", "B0010YSD90", "B000056VP4", "B00066FAQW", "B00005A3KS", "B00E1HIX66", "B00005JLG1", "B00005JLRZ", "B00028HBES", "6304821832", "0788815466", "B000FS9ULC", "B00AEFXSLE", "B000069I0E", "B001BP4K22", "0783230338", "B002GSXKOM", "B0010YSD8Q", "B00ANDDBBY", "B00DNF1SSC", "B000069I1K", "630592273X", "B0006GAI5U", "B000PE0GRI", "B000EXZFCQ", "B00006SFL7", "B0060ZJ7BC", "B00006LPH6", "B004GJYRF0", "B002VWNICM", "B004499NII", "B00AEFXGWK", "B000063RQO", "B00007BK2S", "B000053VAX", "6305428271", "B000G0O5I2", "B00008979O", "B0009A40NO", "B00005NRO0", "B00DQCSWUE", "B000WD3XKO", "6305065551", "0783230524", "B004WJT5E2", "B000XSWVEC", "B0000YEE6M", "B002CA68N4", "B000MNOX9E", "B009NNM9OA", "B000089773", "B000J10F14", "B00AEBB9UU", "B0006GANOQ", "B00AEFYKWU", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00007LP8J", "B00AEFY17E", "B002NZK5U0", "B0009K7RMA", "B00595W4CI", "B00L4K3MLE", "B000HDZKLO", "B000BOH8X2", "B000FUTVLY", "B00003W8NT", "0783237367"], "bought_together": ["B00AMEZDJW", "B00004Y2R1"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AMEZDJW", "B002O3Z4XY", "B00DNF1SSC", "B005SQRYEG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10614}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.81, "brand": "Team Marketing", "asin": "B00005JKE4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R4A6RG4XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hardball"}
{"description": "The key component of this Vista Series DVD is a six-part documentary about the making of the film from idea to theatrical release. M. Night Shyamalan talks at length about the film and his filmmaking technique in this exclusive one-hour feature. The approach is straightforward but at times is as self-congratulatory as a marketing puff piece. Because Shyamalan works so leanly, the five deleted scenes are excellent, including a chilling scene from the film's final act. Also included are storyboard comparisons and another glimpse of one of Shyamalan's early home movies.Signsis the first of the Vista Series to be a single disc and the extras seem light, but there are only a couple of quibbles: the director again does not provide a commentary track and there is no DTS soundtrack.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004BZIY", "B00064LJVE", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00003CXQA", "B000JLTR8Q", "B004SIP92O", "B00AEFYYH6", "B003102JDC", "B00005JNTI", "B00000G3PA", "B002GHHHKQ", "B003Y5H4SO", "B0002DB54A", "B00008G8M4", "B00AEBBA2W", "B0000648X0", "630471193X", "B002O3Z50G", "B00011CZRE", "B000PHVZNE", "B0087ZG7HK", "B002NZK5SM", "B00004XPPG", "B00005JOC9", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B0021L8UXA", "0783225733", "B0006L0LOS", "B0006SGYL0", "B000NOKFHQ", "B005LAIHXQ", "0800177029", "6305767866", "B00004TS0G", "6304711891", "B00AEFY3MC", "B002GIBVVG", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000U1ZV8K", "B00005JNY3", "B00070FX5U", "B00AEBB8NI", "B0002KVUKM", "B00008G8LY", "B000F6IOAM", "B00005JN0T", "B00AEBBA36", "B002LMV7R0", "B002NZK5UU", "B0013FDM7E", "B002O3Z4WK", "B0068FZ0GK", "B00015YVDG", "B000LC55F2", "B00001ZWUS", "B002GHHHL0", "B000BTJDGC", "B000EHRVOW", "B0087ZG7J8", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00005JN2Z", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEFXSLE", "B00019073K", "B00005LC4D", "B00005JL78", "B00IBKXSKA", "B004EPYZPS", "B00000JDIQ", "B00AEBB9WI", "B000RIWAVW", "0780618548", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00005JN0W", "B00AEFXNLY", "6305428115", "0767811100", "0800141601", "B00AEFXT1S", "0780631536", "B00000IQC4", "B004P7CNUY", "B001GCUO02", "B002AS464Q", "B00003CWS3", "B00006FDCD", "B000FS9FCG", "B00005JKZH", "B000067FP8", "B000K7VHQE", "B00BEIYG98", "B00005JNNT", "B000068NNU", "B000XT1P4S", "B0087ZG7PW", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B002I9Z8BM", "B00AEFXKUI", "B0010X73ZG", "B00003CXIP"], "bought_together": ["B00004BZIY", "B004SIP92O"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004BZIY", "B00386EZUY", "B000QUU4M8", "B0000VCZK2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 11300}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.99, "brand": "Touchstone Video", "asin": "B00005JL3T", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51c02AOAyCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Signs"}

{"description": "WithThe Return of the King, the greatest fantasy epic in film history draws to a grand and glorious conclusion. Director Peter Jackson's awe-inspiring adaptation of the Tolkien classicThe Lord of the Ringscould never fully satisfy those who remain exclusively loyal to Tolkien's expansive literature, but as a showcase for physical and technical craftsmanship it is unsurpassed in pure scale and ambition, setting milestone after cinematic milestone as the brave yet charmingly innocent Hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood) continues his mission to Mordor, where he is destined to destroy the soul-corrupting One Ring of Power in the molten lava of Mount Doom. While the heir to the kingdom of Men, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), endures the massive battle at Minas Tirith with the allegiance of the elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom), dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and the great wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), Frodo and stalwart companion Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) must survive the schizoid deceptions of Gollum, who remains utterly convincing as a hybrid of performance (by Andy Serkis) and subtly nuanced computer animation.Jackson and cowriters Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens have much ground to cover; that they do so with intense pacing and epic sweep is impressive enough, but by investing greater depth and consequence in the actions of fellow Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), they ensure thatReturn of the Kingmaintains the trilogy's emphasis on intimate fellowship. While several major characters appear only briefly, and one (Christopher Lee's evil wizard, Saruman) relegated entirely to the extended version on DVD, Jackson is to be commended for his editorial acumen; like Legolas the archer, his aim as a filmmaker is consistently true, and he remains faithful to Tolkien's overall vision. IfReturnsuffers from too many endings, as some critic suggested, it's only because the epic's conclusion is so loyally inclusive of the actors--most notably Astin--who gave it such strength to begin with. By ending theLOTRtrilogy with noble integrity and faith in the power of imaginative storytelling,The Return of the King, like its predecessors, will stand as an adventure for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B002ZG980U", "B002PMV9FG", "B008UZA8FY", "B001NGML48", "B00005JM5E", "B001GZ6QC4", "B005COPWZW", "B008M4C1EO", "B00HFFE8HE", "039548930X", "B000W7F5SS", "B000I0RQVI", "B002VWNIDG", "B000E6EK2Y", "B001BYMX4A", "B004M1A21K", "B007K3JFUQ", "B001DHXT20", "B001UV4XHY", "0345325818", "B003Y5H54W", "B00005JNJV", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000A3XY5A", "B004LWZWGA", "B000U7WV1Y", "B005LXQLRW", "B001OQCV6A", "B000E8M0VA", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000EHRVMY", "0618640150", "B003ZK99NQ", "B0013FDM7E", "B00005JPH2", "B000UNYK4E", "B009JBWOU0", "B00003CX5P", "B00008G8M5", "B00GKOJ98E", "B004LWZW42", "B000H30B2C", "B000P0J0C4", "B00CZDLGDU", "B000M341QE", "B00008G8M4", "B000FKO5QK", "B00HWWUQYY", "B007SPPANM", "B008JFUO72", "B001DJLD1M", "0345538374", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00005JKCH", "B004SIP9U6", "B000YGGNMO", "B00E5I2M9K", "0618126988", "B005OCFGTO", "B00E8S2JZ4", "6305313687", "B004AKCME8", "B0002KVUKM", "B000AARKOO", "B0006GAO5Y", "B000K7VHQ4", "B002ZG997C", "B00AHTYI5M", "B008JFUS0U", "B0042MEQVG", "B00275EGWY", "B00E9PMML2", "B008UZDXEW", "B004SIP7F8", "B00116GEJS", "B00003CXI1", "B003ZKBELG", "B003Y5H5EW", "B000V4UFZK", "B0007PLLBU", "B001DTPZNY", "B002O3Z50Q", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000LP6KNU", "B005G4TJUC", "B00AW0KHTM", "B002ZG97YM", "054792819X", "B00AEFXZJE", "B0000YEEGM", "B002IPFWTE", "B001ECQ75A", "B000065U1N", "B0051MKNV8", "B000W796OM", "B00J49R1BY"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HFFE8HE", "B00003CWT6", "B00005JKZV", "B00BEZTMFY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1589}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JKZY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HS7iSFv5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)"}

{"description": "A Beautiful Mindmanages to twist enough pathos out of John Nash's incredible life story to redeem an at-times goofy portrayal of schizophrenia. Russell Crowe tackles the role with characteristic fervor, playing the Nobel prize-winning mathematician from his days at Princeton, where he developed a groundbreaking economic theory, to his meteoric rise to the cover ofForbesmagazine and an MIT professorship, and on through to his eventual dismissal due to schizophrenic delusions. Of course, it is the delusions that fascinate director Ron Howard and, predictably, go astray. Nash's other world, populated as it is by a maniacal Department of Defense agent (Ed Harris), an imagined college roommate who seems straight out ofDead Poets Society, and an orphaned girl, is so fluid and scriptlike as to make the viewer wonder if schizophrenia is really as slick as depicted. Crowe's physical intensity drags us along as he works admirably to carry the film on his considerable shoulders. No doubt the story of Nash's amazing will to recover his life without the aid of medication is a worthy one, his eventual triumph heartening. Unfortunately, Howard's flashy style is unable to convey much of it.--Fionn Meade", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SIP7ZS", "B0043X1FL8", "B004FQX5B6", "B00AEFZ63M", "B0000YEEGM", "B00003CWQR", "B000ARTN3I", "B000EHQU0S", "6305144168", "0767811100", "B000066HAS", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEFYSWM", "B0002B15ZG", "1451628420", "B00000IQV7", "B000021Y7L", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFY5B6", "B003ASLJQI", "B000XJD3JI", "B004SUDQ22", "B004U7MR1Y", "B00A81MV3U", "B0043X1FM2", "B00B0U2SFE", "B002NZK5UK", "B000N6U0E2", "B003B3NGS6", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00004RJ73", "B00003CWRX", "B00125WAWS", "B00005JLSB", "6305428352", "B00008EY60", "0800141806", "B00001ZWUS", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEBB9CS", "6304712936", "0780619587", "B00007GZR5", "B000YAF4MA", "B000KX0IOA", "B004SIP8W0", "B00080ZG10", "B00B9LNPA6", "0783225733", "B003U0AHBO", "B00004BZIY", "B00005JND5", "B000E33VWW", "B003NF97NK", "B0038M2AZA", "B002CPMB9O", "B000P0J0EM", "B000A3XY5A", "B00AFEXRME", "B00005Q4CS", "B000LC55F2", "B00AEBB9SM", "B0006FYOTC", "B000056VP4", "B002WNU0QW", "B000RTB0R6", "0684819066", "B00003CXZ4", "B00AEFY17E", "B000EGDB10", "B002VECM6S", "B002ZG980U", "B001P9KR8U", "B001N44BVQ", "B000LP6KNU", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0002V7ON8", "B0018CWW5K", "B00JPQ1INI", "B0030Y12FU", "B003ELKNH2", "B000K2UGZM", "B00121QGPY", "B0001CNRAM", "B00003CXFV", "0783223609", "B007N31YH0", "B002HK9IDQ", "B005BYBZEK", "B000JJ5F8O", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B003UESJHO", "B00A7MSQSO", "B004SIP9U6", "B00005JL78", "B00012QLB4", "B003UESJH4", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000K7VHQE"], "bought_together": ["B004SIP7ZS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00C7MW5EI", "B004SIP7ZS", "B001F34HRS", "B00001ZWUS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3605}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.99, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

The story finds Earth's post-World War III humankind in a state of severe emotional repression: If no one feels anything, no one will be inspired by dark passions to attack their neighbors. Writer-director Kurt Wimmer's monochromatic,Metropolis-influenced cityscape provides an excellent backdrop to the heavy-handed mission of John Preston (Christian Bale), a top cop who busts \"sense offenders\" and crushes sentimental, sensual, and artistic relics from a bygone era. Predictably, Preston becomes intrigued by his victims and that which they die to cherish; he stops taking his mandatory, mood-flattening drug and is even aroused by a doomed prisoner (Emily Watson). Wimmer's wrongheaded martial arts/dueling guns motif is sheer silliness (a battle over a puppy doesn't help), butEquilibriumshould be seen for Bale's moving performance as a man shocked back to human feeling.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006JDVV", "B000LC55F2", "B000FS9FCG", "B0009A40ES", "B000KX0IM2", "B0007Y08QA", "B00AEFYCW8", "0767805712", "B00005JL78", "B0018O4YT0", "B001FB55HQ", "B00003CXZ4", "B00AEFXCLU", "B000FGGE68", "B000WMA6R8", "B002ZG980U", "B003XURDAY", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00005JPAR", "B000GFLKF8", "B00K2CHX9C", "B00AEFXW8I", "B000XR9L50", "B004XQO90O", "B000N6TX1I", "B000FKO5QK", "B004SIP9Z6", "B007WZTMCI", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000093FLA", "B0073U2FB2", "0783225814", "B000K7VHQ4", "B001OQCVI8", "B00011CZRE", "B000P0J0AQ", "B00000JSJC", "B0000AXE8I", "B008JFUQZ2", "B007X4ECMI", "B002ZG97CO", "B00AZMFJYA", "B008JFUO36", "B004P2VQZC", "B0000AC8LR", "B0045HCJT4", "B00J5LXT6M", "B00AEFY5B6", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00177Y9ZC", "B003UESJHO", "B000XA5K48", "B001DJLD1M", "B008JFUN50", "B005LAIHXQ", "B00K7IPFSM", "B0006IIPIK", "B005LAII8A", "B0013PSTMC", "B008JFUNHI", "B001L57ZYM", "B002QEHPQU", "B0034G4ORC", "B004SIP95G", "0767802519", "B001TOD92C", "B008JFUS0U", "B000087F6L", "B0051MKNV8", "B007WXUVHU", "B005LAIH2C", "B000R9U3B0", "B004LWZW7E", "B000MZHW40", "B00005JNJV", "B00005JPD0", "B000GGSMC6", "B0000ACOXL", "B0085A9HU6", "B009YQJ322", "B003Y5H5GK", "B009MO57H6", "B004LWZW4M", "0800195175", "B002QW7ALM", "B00005JMA8", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B001EAWMGA", "B002O3Z4WU", "B000BW7QWW", "B001GUYB08", "B00005V9HH", "B001UV4XWY", "B00A8MGIZG", "B002GSXKNI", "B00IARA8KM", "B004LWZWGA", "B00005JA8B", "B001QTXM5Y"], "bought_together": ["B000LC55F2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007Y08QA", "B006ZL1PGG", "B000LC55F2", "B004P7CMJG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 61424}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.34, "brand": "Dimension", "asin": "B00005JLWN", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K2WVH130L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Equilibrium"}

{"description": "Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen play good girl/bad girl sisters who suddenly find themselves on a high-speed chase escaping crooks, attracting hunks, and wreaking havoc in this lightweight comedy set in the Big Apple. Ashley plays high school scholar Jane Ryan, an overachiever with her sights set on winning a college scholarship competition. Mary-Kate plays her sister, Roxy, a rebellious teen truant who would rather be a rock star than a student. Since their mother's death, the sisters' relationship has been strained. Now their worlds collide when a day in Manhattan forces Jane and Roxy to join forces, overcoming their differences to battle an international smuggling ring while trying to make it in time for Jane's competition. While the script is predictably bland, viewers will enjoy the comedic strengths of Eugene Levy (Serendipity,American Pie) as Roxy's ubiquitous truant officer. Though the twins manage some decent slapstick, their sensuality, sexual innuendo, and suggestive disrobing is disappointing. DVD bonus features include some hilarious bloopers and alternate endings.

{"description": "Like a good dream, Sofia Coppola'sLost in Translationenvelops you with an aura of fantastic light, moody sound, head-turning love, and a feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, even though you've probably never been to this neon-fused version of Tokyo. Certainly Bob Harris has not. The 50-ish actor has signed on for big money shooting whiskey ads instead of doing something good for his career or his long-distance family. Jetlagged, helplessly lost with his Japanese-speaking director, and out of sync with the metropolis, Harris (Bill Murray, never better) befriends the married but lovelorn 25-year-old Charlotte (played with heaps of poise by 18-year-old Scarlett Johansson). Even before her photographer husband all but abandons her, she is adrift like Harris but in a total entrapment of youth. How Charlotte and Bill discover they are soul mates will be cherished for years to come. Written and directed by Coppola (The Virgin Suicides), the film is far more atmospheric than plot-driven: we whiz through Tokyo parties, karaoke bars, and odd nightlife, always ending up in the impossibly posh hotel where the two are staying. The wisps of bittersweet loneliness of Bill and Charlotte are handled smartly and romantically, but unlike modern studio films, this isn't a May-November fling film. Surely and steadily, the film ends on a much-talked-about grace note, which may burn some, yet awards film lovers who \"always had Paris\" with another cinematic destination of the heart.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305428239", "B0007UC8Y4", "B000BX8R10", "B00005JMJG", "B0000640VJ", "B0010X8NF0", "B003UESJLU", "B007L6VR12", "0767821408", "B00007AJF8", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00DW5IKYS", "B001QOGYBI", "B000M06KJ8", "B00005JLRE", "B00000G02H", "B0006TPE4C", "B0007TKOAA", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00DYVUBYM", "B00H9HZITU", "B000Z8GZYW", "B004SEUIXS", "B00AEFXN9G", "B003CRM6PA", "B00008RH3J", "B000EQHXNW", "B0001I1K32", "B0008JIJ2O", "B001DJ7PR8", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0009PVZD2", "B000CS464G", "B00337KM2S", "B003102JDM", "0790734796", "B001P3SA8K", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B0000WN0SC", "B00003CWTI", "B00003CXZ4", "B00008975Z", "B0057ZAA6W", "B000IU37SO", "B00004RJ73", "B00AEFXGIY", "B007P9HW3M", "B005MYEQ4U", "B000K7VHQE", "B00005JNC2", "B00079Z9VO", "B000063JDE", "B0001US61O", "B0000WN15O", "B00G7QPXUI", "B0041KKYEM", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00006LPGP", "B0006H32EI", "B00005JKJA", "B00AEFYCL4", "B000KX0IOK", "B002T9H2LA", "B001TOD92C", "B004XVMCKS", "B00AEBB9CS", "B008220DGE", "0767802519", "B000069HYF", "B007D5E7C2", "B000M7XRAG", "B004U7MR14", "B003O7I6SE", "B000A7DVR2", "B005LAIIJY", "B00A81MV3U", "B000055Y0X", "B00005V9HH", "B000E33VWW", "0783225903", "B00AEFXE9U", "B000N6TX1I", "B00CIOD6HK", "B0021L8UOY", "B004SIP95G", "B000PAAJZ6", "B002ZG980U", "B007UW9WOQ", "B00GKOJ98E", "B0014D5RBE", "B00011CZRE", "B001HN699A", "B000M4RG7E", "B003ELKNH2", "0767802535", "B00121QGPY", "B004FQX5B6", "6305609764", "B0009A40ES"], "bought_together": ["B0007UC8Y4", "6305428239"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00JAQJMJ0", "B007L6VR12", "B001QOGYBI", "B0010X8NF0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2901}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.77, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JMJ4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518vLN4%2B7KL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lost in Translation"}

{"description": "Batman Beginsdiscards the previous four films in the series and recasts the Caped Crusader as a fearsome avenging angel. That's good news, because the series, which had gotten off to a rousing start under Tim Burton, had gradually dissolved into self-parody by 1997'sBatman & Robin. As the title implies,Batman Beginstells the story anew, when Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) flees Western civilization following the murder of his parents. He is taken in by a mysterious instructor named Ducard (Liam Neeson in another mentor role) and urged to become a ninja in the League of Shadows, but he instead returns to his native Gotham City resolved to end the mob rule that is strangling it. But are there forces even more sinister at hand?Cowritten by the team of David S. Goyer (a veteran comic book writer) and director Christopher Nolan (Memento),Batman Beginsis a welcome return to the grim and gritty version of the Dark Knight, owing a great debt to the graphic novels that preceded it. It doesn't have the razzle dazzle, or the mass appeal, ofSpider-Man 2(though the Batmobile is cool), and retelling the origin means it starts slowly, like most \"first\" superhero movies. But it's certainly the best Bat-film since Burton's original, and one of the best superhero movies of its time. Bale cuts a good figure as Batman, intense and dangerous but with some of the lightheartedness Michael Keaton brought to the character. Michael Caine provides much of the film's humor as the family butler, Alfred, and as the love interest, Katie Holmes (Dawson's Creek) is surprisingly believable in her first adult role. Also featuring Gary Oldman as the young police officer Jim Gordon, Morgan Freeman as a Q-like gadgets expert, and Cillian Murphy as the vile Jonathan Crane.--David HoriuchiBatmanat Amazon.comAllBatmanDVDsBatman Begins101: A Comic Book PrimerWhere Have I Seen Christian Bale?AllBatmanComics and Graphic NovelsBatmanToysBatman BeginsSoundtrackStills fromBatman Begins(click for larger images)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA", "B002GSXKN8", "B000P0J06U", "B001OST0LW", "B000P0J06K", "B004EPZ07K", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00005JKCH", "B001GCUO1Q", "B002ZG980U", "B001OST0M6", "B008JFUPFI", "B004LWZWFQ", "B00005JMQW", "B004LWZW42", "B000VI70QS", "B001DHXT20", "B000M341QE", "B0000959N0", "B000UR9T8C", "B00005JNTU", "B000AYELVA", "B00E5I2M6I", "B002IPFWTE", "B000HEVZ9E", "B0090SI56Y", "B002HWRYJE", "B0006L0LOS", "B000OVLBF8", "B00003CWT6", "B000VR0570", "B00E5I2MEK", "B000HCO83Q", "B0007P0Y7C", "B008JFUO72", "B00F4FFO8E", "B001CDR1FG", "B000P0J0EW", "B002T9H2LA", "B0002KVUKM", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00005N5S5", "B0083SBMBM", "B0001BKAEY", "B00AQSN7HE", "B000J10EQU", "B00005JKZY", "B002NXSRVG", "B000AYELVU", "B001OQCV6A", "B004LWZW4M", "B001VLBDD0", "B001GZ6QEC", "B004GJYRA0", "B007REV4T8", "B001TK80C0", "B000HRJLII", "B001QTXM5Y", "B005G4TJUC", "B00005JKZV", "B0053FANT0", "B00005JA8B", "B003YAR97K", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00001ZWUS", "B004EPYZQC", "B001N44BVQ", "B006VRRGNK", "B001AEF6HM", "B00000JQB5", "B00011CZRE", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00AEFY0F2", "B007K3JFUQ", "B0002IQMAM", "B00005JN0T", "B002SJIO4A", "B000VWYJ86", "B0013FDM7E", "B00005JNTI", "B00407PNY2", "B00DTPRZ24", "B008JFUS0U", "B00004Z4WR", "B000FS9FCG", "B000QXDED6", "B0085A9HU6", "0780624890", "B00005LOUK", "B000065U1N", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005JN5T", "B001QB9H1U", "B00005JMUA", "0792844890", "B0007DFJ0G", "B004EPYZSK", "B008JFUOWM", "B00AEFY5B6"], "bought_together": ["B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009JBWOU0", "B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA", "B002ZG980U"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7806}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.99, "brand": "DC Comics", "asin": "B00005JNJV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518zjc4XtzL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Batman Begins (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Max Headroomis the stuff that cult followings are made of. Max, indelible '80s icon, began his stuttering, glitchy computer-generated existence as the host of a British music video showcase. He went on to shill for New Coke, and then got his own fleshed-out back-story in a British TV movie. Credit ABC for taking the bold leap to give Max his own prime-time series in 1987. \"What kind of show is this anyway?\" Max asks early on. What, indeed? It'sBlade RunnermeetsNetwork, a bleak comedy and cyber satire that, even decades later, one can't watch without marveling how something so off-center ever get on the air. Max Headroom's pop culture cachet (featured on the cover ofNewsweek, parodied in the comic stripDoonesbury) did not translate into ratings. The show was cancelled after 14 episodes (an unaired episode is included in this set). Decades later, society has caught up to the show that was ahead of its time. The series is set \"20 minutes into the future\" in a dystopian landscape where instead of a chicken in every pot there is a TV in every homeless tent. Evil and corrupt television executives, in consort with advertising agencies, will literally kill for ratings. In the pilot episode, intrepid investigative reporter Edison Carter (Matt Frewer) discovers his own network is behind blipverts, a potentially lethal brand of advertising that compresses a 30-second commercial into three seconds, causing more-vulnerable viewers to explode. Carter survives an attempt on his life by network goons, but not before Bryce (Chris Young), the network's resident boy genius, downloads Carter's memory into a computer to see what he knows of the scheme. A star is born: Max Headroom (Frewer again), who escapes into the system and pops up at will onscreen to offer wisecracks (\"You know how you can tell our network president is lying? His lips move.\") and Mork-like societal observations. In one episode, he confuses Missile Mike, a gun-toting character in an ultra-violent children's show, for an actual rampaging killer. \"Who introduced [kids] to this?\" Max asks. Meanwhile, Carter, with invaluable assistance from his newsroom controller Theora (Amanda Pays reprising her role from the British movie) and incorruptible producer (Jeffrey Tambor), uncovers venal conspiracies such as an attempt to legalize a vicious sport that exploits children so it can be broadcast. It's frightening at times how prescient this show was. This set's bonus features are exhaustive but are missing some keyMax-abilia. The British pilot that started it all is absent, as is Frewer from a cast reunion. But talking heads segments with the show's creators, writers, and designers offer a thorough, inside retrospective look at the series. Welcome back, Max. Boy, do we need you now.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00LCT48JC", "B000F7CMPE", "6301651677", "B005NKIPUO", "B00F3L8P26", "B00005JOJP", "B003Y7TJXA", "B00404ME2E", "B00IT3KQMC", "0553343521", "B00J5LXMTG", "B00KB614HQ", "B0002MHDW4", "B003BGZ61S", "B00KCTG4PO", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B00L326LTI", "B0009JE6FM", "B001DW2BG0", "B006LPHY6G", "B004EXWGJW", "B000B8I9XQ", "B0000AZKJ8", "B0006UEVUE", "B008R52LA2", "B000ELL1QC", "B0009JE6G6", "B00JK47BHM", "B000FOQ03C", "B000BCCAEQ", "B000FJH5MC", "B00GTZWZH6", "B002VA5A02", "B00466X70Y", "B00ISSF7S6", "B000H6SY2I", "B004VT9JMG", "B0053TRRNG", "B000JLTRHW", "B002WJHDJI", "B005OTGS6C", "B00HW3L2R8", "B000063UR1", "B000W4KT9G", "B000R7I3YG", "B0006GAO18", "B00465I156", "B003H9LIU2", "B00DDNMQGC", "B00IYJFB2G", "B000BHHVNQ", "B000SINSXU", "B004EXWGHY", "B00HWWUQYY", "B00005JKEX", "B0006FO9B0", "B00I462XGG", "B000RZIGVS", "B00170LCWC", "B000PHX8RA", "B00347AIM6", "B0003JAOO0", "B00E688AZE", "B00E5G03I4", "B004P3HA8I", "B00LCT48HE", "B000NTMA0G", "B000UX6THK", "B006MFQ4OS", "B001CQONOA", "B00447G2X4", "B000BOH8Y6", "1607069644", "0783225903", "B00272NJ7U", "B0015NORDM", "B0012IX35S", "B00A04YHI2", "1937163083", "B00A2H9OZS", "B00061QJSK", "B00AEFYDM2", "B002Y26UR4", "B00GX7D5G0", "B001AQO3XS", "B006WK4Y8Q", "B00HCK7THS", "B00JAQJNN0", "1607068524", "B002BAW6FE", "B0028M9LNA", "B00029NKS8", "B009P3J69O", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B0000542CA", "B00C7A8WWO", "B005BUA1JY", "B006WK4Y6I", "B00CQAQF1A", "B00E3UN44W"], "bought_together": ["B000F7CMPE", "B00005JOJP"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000F7CMPE", "B005NKIPUO", "B00F3L8P26", "B000FJH5MC"]}, "price": 33.8, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 29042}, "asin": "B00005JNU5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510rwHSRzzL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Max Headroom: The Complete Series"}
{"description": "Critics and controversy aside,The Da Vinci Codeis a verifiable blockbuster. Combine the film's huge worldwide box-office take with over 100 million copies of Dan Brown's book sold, andThe Da Vinci Codehas clearly made the leap from pop-culture hit to a certifiable franchise. The leap for any story making the move from book to big screen, however, is always more perilous. In the case ofThe Da Vinci Code, the plot is concocted of such a preposterous formula of elements that you wouldn&#x92;t envy screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, the man tasked with making this story filmable. The script followsDan Brown&#x92;s bookas closely as possible while incorporating a few needed changes, including a better ending. And if you&#x92;re like most of the world, by now you&#x92;ve read the book and know how it goes: while lecturing in Paris, noted Harvard Professor of Symbology Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is summoned to the Louvre by French police to help decipher a bizarre series of clues left at the scene of the murder of the chief curator. Enter Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), gifted cryptologist. Neveu and Langdon team up to solve the mystery, and from there the story is propelled across Europe, ballooning into a modern-day mini-quest for the Holy Grail, where secret societies are discovered, codes are broken, and murderous albino monks are thwarted&#x85; oh, and alternative theories about the life of Christ and the beginnings of Christianity are presented too, of course. It&#x92;s not the typical formula for a stock Hollywood thriller. In fact, taken solely as a mystery, the movie almost works--despite some gaping holes--mostly just because it keeps moving. Brown&#x92;s greatest trick was  to have the entire story take place in one day, so the action is forced to keep moving, despite some necessary pauses for exposition. As a screen couple, Hanks and Tautou are just fine together but not exactly memorable; meanwhile Sir Ian McKellen&#x92;s scenery-chewing as pivotal character Sir Leigh Teabing is just what the film needed to keep it from taking itself too seriously. The whole thing is like a good roller-coaster ride: try not to think too much about it--just sit back and enjoy the trip.--Daniel VanciniVisit The Da Vinci Code StoreOn The DVDThe DVD extras on a film as popular asThe Da Vinci Codeshould be plentiful, and this version doesn&#x92;t skimp. With over 90 minutes of special features, including ten behind-the-scenes featurettes, there&#x92;s a lot here to explore beyond the film itself. The question is, is there anything new here that we haven&#x92;t heard before, in all the hype, pseudo-documentaries, and controversy surrounding the movie, to make it worthwhile?  For most viewers, the answer will be \"yes.\" Essentially, if you like the movie, if you enjoyed the book, you will get a lot out of them.Just as the movie is intended to make the book come to life, the DVD extras should make the film come to life by pointing the audience into the world of the filmmakers, connecting the dots between print and film, and for the most part they do just that. The extras here range from the typical look behind-the-scenes to more in-depth features on the supporting characters, the locations, and theMona Lisaherself.  \"First Day on the Set with Ron Howard\" features the director gushing about the opportunity to film in the Louvre and work with Tom Hanks again (the two worked together before onSplashandApollo 13). It&#x92;s a short piece that doesn&#x92;t reveal much beyond making an attempt to share Howard&#x92;s excitement (with the \"Gee, I really loved working with him/her on this project\" that you hear in every such featurette), but viewers might enjoy seeing how the stage was set up in the famous museum, down to the spike tape on the floor showing actors where to hit their marks.The Filmmaking Experience, Parts 1 and 2further explores the creative and technical aspects of the filmmaking process.A Conversation with Dan Brownstarts out feeling like a puff-piece (the man who wrote this book got started at age 5 with a story calledThe Giraffe, The Pig, and the Pants on Fire. \"It was a thriller,\" he says.) and unfortunately it doesn&#x92;t go very deep into much of anything of interest. But on the other hand, this isn&#x92;t60 Minuteshere; it&#x92;s intended to give viewers a better sense of the man behind the franchise, which it does.  Much of the footage from this interview is sprinkled throughout some of the other featurettes. Meanwhile, the character behind the franchise, Robert Langdon, is examined in his own featurette, as is Sophie Neveu. The cool thing here is getting under the skin of the actors to see how they approached the characters, knowing that most of the movie-going public already has formed their own ideas about the characters from the book.The most interesting extras are the featurettes that focus on the history behind the mystery. Or is it the mystery behind the history?  Either way, the first one on theMona Lisa, and the second featurette on the many codes and symbols that are hidden throughout the movie balance out the remainder of the extras nicely by demonstrating the sense of intrigue, mystery, and game-playing adventure that madeThe Da Vinci Codeso popular in the first place.--Daniel VanciniBeyondThe Da Vinci CodeThe Films of Tom HanksThe Films of Ron HowardThe Da Vinci DVDs: Decoding \"The Da Vinci Code\"More About The ArtistStills fromThe Da Vinci Code(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00005JN5E", "B0013BM63O", "B002ZTQVKM", "B0007XG02W", "B001OLP2TI", "B002C68WNW", "0307474275", "B002O5M4SU", "B00005JLSB", "B000PHVZNE", "B0077ATSSQ", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000EPR7NE", "0743486226", "B001LMAK9W", "B000P0J0EW", "0385504209", "B005HWAOP2", "B001OQCV2E", "B0013XZ2QK", "B001EZE5D8", "B00005JL3T", "B000EOTW0Q", "6304711891", "B000YDBPAM", "0307950689", "B000HT386M", "B00008G8M4", "B000P0J0EM", "B002ZG99KO", "0800141806", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00001ZWUS", "B0002V7OI8", "B002O3Z50Q", "B0006GANOQ", "B002NZK5UU", "B000NQRR1Q", "0385504225", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00005Y71F", "B000OYC7BW", "B00DL48BM6", "B00026ZG10", "B0018CWW5K", "B00004BZIY", "B0000B1OFL", "B00023B1LC", "B000N6U0E2", "B00A8MGIZG", "B00005JM5E", "B002LMV7R0", "B00004Z4WR", "B000K2UGXO", "B00005JMYC", "B001MVYUQG", "B00005JLWN", "B000056PMU", "B0000AOV4I", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00441GYXS", "B001F12J0C", "B00ES28X3C", "B002ZG980U", "B001VLBDD0", "B00008K76U", "B001TK80C0", "B008JFURII", "B000VWYJ86", "0792159659", "B00AEFYGBA", "B0009MDPYM", "B00177YA1K", "B00005N5S5", "B0043X1FM2", "B0002J58HO", "B00005JM5B", "B00AZMFJYA", "B003AWRMBA", "074349346X", "B003VA3JUO", "0783240295", "6305767866", "B0000844I8", "B000065U1N", "B002GHHHKQ", "B000K7VHQE", "B0000AXE8I", "0800177258", "B000ASDFGI", "B003Q6D2B4", "B000HRMAPE", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JMOW", "B00GPWEPZ8", "0312944926", "B000VI70QS", "B000KF0GWW"], "bought_together": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00005JN5E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00I563DSC", "B0013BM63O", "1400079152"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7555}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.5, "brand": "DaVinci", "asin": "B00005JOC9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SLBDLMtIL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Da Vinci Code (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)"}

{"description": "Helen Mirren reigns supreme inThe Queen, a witty and ingenious look at a moment that rocked the house of Windsor:  the week that followed the sudden death of Princess Diana in 1997. Diana's death came at just the same time that Prime Minister Tony Blair (played by the bright Michael Sheen) was settling into his new government--and trying to figure out the delicate relationship between 10 Downing Street and Queen Elizabeth II (Mirren). A large portion of the British population was trying to figure out the Windsors that week, as Elizabeth remained stiff-upper-lip and largely mum about the death of the beloved princess. In Peter Morgan's skillful script, we watch as Blair grows increasingly impatient with the Royals, who are sequestered in their Scottish estate while the public demands some show of grief. Prince Philip (James Cromwell, in good form) clumsily decides to take Diana's sons hunting, while a sympathetically-treated Prince Charles (Alex Jennings) displays some frustration with his mother's eerie calm.None of this conveys how funny the film is, or how deftly it flows from one scene to the next. Director Stephen Frears (Dirty Pretty Things) deserves great credit for that, and for the performances, and for the movie's marvelous sense of well-roundedness; you could see this movie and groan at the cluelessness of the Royals and their outmoded existence, or you might just sympathize with showing reserve in a world that values gross public displays of emotion. But either way, you'll marvel at Mirren, who makes the Queen far more alert and human than one might ever have imagined.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B003UESJH4", "B001C4AFOY", "B004M9QNVK", "B004GXKBDI", "B0059XTUVI", "B000Z8H0IC", "B000ZOXDFA", "B000RF7XYO", "B001L57ZZG", "B001TH92N4", "B000BKDNX0", "B0006Q93H4", "B000EOTELI", "B004XYOQU4", "B009TT0BSE", "B0012QE4Q2", "B001QUF3SW", "B007HW8U2Y", "B000EHQUGC", "B00342ANSA", "B004SIP9U6", "B000V02CNW", "B00005O7N8", "B00GM7STPI", "B003N9ASF2", "B002ZG99EK", "B004SIP71M", "B003Y5H4Y8", "B0001I55M4", "B001AZIRVI", "B00015HXDG", "B000E1NXJ0", "B000RF7XYY", "B00121QGPY", "B009AMANBA", "B000M06KJ8", "B000MEYJHY", "B00005JOFQ", "B007TBJUVI", "B0085A9JXG", "B003AND1SM", "B000NIVJF4", "B0010X73Z6", "B000K7VHQE", "B00005JKNF", "B000MCH5P4", "B001TR4G6W", "B004P7CNZO", "B0050PYNN0", "B000GH3CR0", "B00AEFY8MM", "B0068MNO4S", "B002RSDW80", "B001MVWFAO", "B004ZNFTDQ", "B000255LIY", "B000V6LSOA", "B00ARX2VZW", "B000G6BM0K", "B008220C38"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003UESJH4", "B004M9QNVK", "B001C4AFOY", "B004GXKBDI"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPAM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K34G0GCBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Queen"}
{"description": "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's Endis a rollicking voyage in the same spirit of the two earlierPiratesfilms, yet far darker in spots (and nearly three hours to boot). The action, largely revolving around a pirate alliance against the ruthless East India Trading Company, doesn't disappoint, though the violence is probably too harsh for young children. Through it all, the plucky cast (Keira Knightley, Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush) are buffeted by battle, maelstroms, betrayal, treachery, a ferocious Caribbean weather goddess, and that gnarly voyage back from the world's end--but with their wit intact. As always, Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow tosses off great lines ; he chastises \"a woman scorned, like which hell hath no fury than!\" He insults an opponent with a string of epithets, ending in \"yeasty codpiece.\"!In the previousThe Curse of the Black Pearl, Sparrow was killed--sent to Davy Jones' Locker. In the opening scenes, the viewer sees that death has  not been kind to Sparrow--but that's not to say he hasn't found endless ways to amuse himself, cavorting with dozens of hallucinated versions of himself on the deck of the Black Pearl. But Sparrow is needed in this world, so a daring rescue brings him back. Keith Richards' much ballyhooed appearance as Jack's dad is little more than a cameo, though he does play a wistful guitar. But the action, as always, is more than satisfying, held together by Depp, who, outsmarting the far-better-armed British yet again, causes a bewigged commander to muse: \"Do you think he plans it all out, or just makes it up as he goes along?\" As far as fans are concerned, it matters not.--A.T. HurleyOn the DVDHere's something you can't say about just any DVD extras: There appears to bemoreof Keith Richards in the outtakes, interviews, and other special features on theAt World's Enddisc than in the actual film. For those scenes alone, this special edition is well worth the price. Richards looks as woozy and gamey as all the rumors suggested, and answers questions he's not asked, with Johnny Depp sitting next to him, almost acting as a translator. Richards offers pithy comments like, \"Everything I do is original, you better believe,\" and smiles when other cast members call him \"Two-Take Richards\" for supposedly nailing his scenes.The packed second disc also includes a terrific mini-doc on how the filmmakers created the famous maelstrom, in an enormous hanger in Palmdale, California, with the ships floating 30 feet off the ground. \"Just moving theBlack Pearlwas an enormous undertaking,\" says producer Jerry Bruckheimer with serious understatement. Other cool extras include \"Tale of the Many Jacks,\" deleted scenes with great commentary, \"The World of Chow Yun-Fat,\" a bio of composer Hans Zimmer, features on the set designers, a look at the impressive Brethren Court, and some hilarious bloopers. \"You can't curse in a Disney film,\" deadpans Depp when a costar blurts out something blue. \"See?

{"description": "One of the first things a viewer notices aboutCloverfieldis that it doesn't play by ordinary storytelling rules, making this intriguing horror film as much a novelty as an event. Told from the vertiginous point-of-view of a camcorder-wielding group of friends,Cloverfieldbegins like a primetime television soap opera about young Manhattanites coping with changes in their personal lives. Rob (Michael Stahl-David) is leaving New York to take an executive job at a company in Japan. At his goodbye party in a crowded loft, Rob&#x92;s brother Jason (Mike Vogel) hands a camcorder to best friend Hud (T.J. Miller), who proceeds to tape the proceedings over old footage of Rob&#x92;s ex-girlfriend, Beth (Odette Yustman)--images shot during happy times in that now-defunct relationship. Naturally, Beth shows up at the party with a new beau, bumming Rob out completely. Just before one's eyes glaze over from all this heartbreaking stuff (captured by Hud, who's something of a doofus, in laughably shaky camerawork), the unexpected happens: New York is suddenly under attack from a Godzilla-like monster stomping through midtown and destroying everything and everybody in sight. Rob and company hit the streets, but rather than run with other evacuees, they head toward the center of the storm so that Rob can rescue an injured Beth. There are casualties along the way, but the journey into fear is fascinating and immediate if emotionally remote--a consequence of seeing these proceedings through the singular, subjective perspective of a camcorder and of a story that intentionally leaves major questions unanswered: Who or what is this monster? Where did it come from? The lack of a backstory, and spare views of the marauding creature, are clever ways by producer J.J. Abrams and director Matt Reeves to keep an audience focused exclusively on what&#x92;s on the screen.  But it also makesCloverfieldcuriously uninvolving. Ultimately,Cloverfield, with its spectacular effects brilliantly woven into a home-video look, is a celebration of infinite possibilities in this age of accessible, digital media.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B004EPYZQ2", "B00IO9D3ZI", "B00EMMDMKM", "B002SJIO5E", "B0044ZOI32", "B001AR0D4A", "B004BZ5AMS", "B001MVYUQQ", "B003BJO8KU", "B0018AG6X6", "B005LAIGPU", "B00IO8VMB6", "B000PKG8SS", "B003Y5H5GU", "B00BPA2PGG", "B0017U7PT6", "B001YV502C", "B0013FBS20", "B008JFUR10", "B001KZVQJI", "B001CW7ZW6", "B0035WTJFW", "B000Y7U98W", "B003ABZGRI", "B000VDDWEC", "B000VDDWEM", "B002JT69IM", "B00164EAC8", "B002ZG981E", "B00AEFXORM", "B001DZOC3W", "B008SAPC20", "B003Y5H59M", "B00HERVMTK", "B00AVSFIV2", "B0032KNA4I", "B000L212HW", "B001FB55I0", "B0018O4YSQ", "B002ZG997M", "B002ZG9788", "B008G33O0G", "B000VDDWE2", "B00K2CHVSK", "B001GCUO5W", "B005J4TLQG", "B000PC6A3E", "B0027VT9ES", "B001F7MSG6", "B0051T46XM", "B00111YM60", "B001GZ6QEC", "B002HR1W1K", "B004SIPA4G", "B001OQCVII", "B001JNNDBA", "B001GKJ2FC", "B000WQWPKA", "B000OT6V00", "B0021L8UXK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004EPYZQ2", "B00IO8VMB6", "B004LWZW4W", "B005LAIHY0"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPXY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Wm5GO98oL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cloverfield [Theatrical Release]"}
{"description": "The fact-based mystery ofHollywoodlandtakes place in 1959, when the death ofAdventures of SupermanTV star George Reeves cast a pall over the waning days of golden-age Hollywood. As written by Paul Bernbaum, this intriguing whodunit effectively evokes the tainted atmosphere that surrounded Reeves' death (officially ruled a suicide but never conclusively solved), and speculates on circumstances to suggest that Reeves may have been murdered. In combining the melancholy course of Reeves' career with the investigation of a down-and-out private detective into the possible causes of Reeves' death, the film evolves into an engrossing study of parallels between lives on either side of the Hollywood dream. Building upon a distinguished career in TV including episodes of HBO'sThe Sopranos,RomeandSix Feet Under, director Allen Coulter finds a satisfying balance between the tragic overtones of the Reeves case and the time-honored elements of the gumshoe genre, with Adrien Brody doing fine work as private eye Louis Simo, a fictional composite character who is our conduit to the desperate yearnings of Reeves' final months.In a critically acclaimed performance, Ben Affleck plays Reeves in moody flashbacks, caught betweenSupermanstardom and financial dependence on his lover Toni Mannix (Diane Lane), the somewhat predatory wife of Hollywood \"fixer\" and MGM honcho Eddie Mannix (Bob Hoskins), whose mob connections suggest foul play as Simo's investigation progresses. Reeves' subsequent lover (played by Robin Tunney) may also be culpable, and as Simo's own personal life unravels, his empathy for Reeves takes on added significance. In presenting its mystery as a set of plausible scenarios,Hollywoodlandholds interest as a mystery that's refreshingly compassionate toward the fate of its characters. Warts and all, they're likable dreamers in a town where dreams don't always come true.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000K2UVZM", "B002VWNICC", "B003P3PQL2", "B000A5046K", "B000BT96FA", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B000HWZ4E8", "B000IU37SO", "B00005JL5F", "B00015HWX2", "B0009G3B0G", "B00AEBB89W", "B000087F7Q", "B000QGEB1M", "B000LC3IDS", "B00003CWSR", "B003UESJEW", "B000EQHXNW", "B004SEUIZG", "0783235380", "B0001WTVIE", "B001NFNFNU", "1618933949", "B0002V7O5Q", "B000AM6P2U", "B000I8OM94", "B00J2PQYYK", "B00ICWO1LC", "B00006RCNY", "B00000K31T", "B0016Q2D66", "B00002RAO2", "B003UESJCY", "B000092T3P", "B000OYAT3U", "6305428522", "B003VEL9EI", "B00HZVX14O", "B004SIP7VM", "0790732149", "B001U0HB5Q", "B004XVMCH6", "B000HT3PBU", "B00AEFXRWO", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00006RCNV", "B004XVMCKS", "B0000959N0", "B00I116MVQ", "B000Q8QH0I", "B00AEFYC96", "B00ARA4SLU", "B00HGBAG5K", "B00006CXGZ", "B004LYWPZE", "B004ALIG1U", "B0016MOWOQ", "B000IJ79XE", "B00DC5JVE6", "B000M341SC", "B00029LO5E", "B00CHMBQRA", "B000F7CMRM", "B000FO0AHY", "B00E18QKJ2", "B0045O2PHS", "B004SIP7PS", "B0001NBNDY", "B00J5LXT44", "B003VE9WU6", "B000C65Z1G", "B00AEFYIDG", "B00005JMON", "B00005JL8F", "B00009MEKN", "B00HT2RTU6", "B000EHSVSC", "B0006IIKQW", "B00AEFXBPM", "B00HOGBXTU", "B003LR5BD0", "B0018O4YT0", "B0000694ZI", "B00005NKSK", "B002J1RZHE", "B000286RNE", "B0030BOCMS", "B00H91LVOM", "B000YV1Q2G", "B002DU39GW", "B003UESJEM", "B00F6SHG5S", "B000MXPE7O", "B001N44BVQ", "B0089XJXRQ", "B003EYVXSW", "B001DJ7PR8", "B0000C2IVA", "B000U1ZV76", "B0002O7XUO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000K2UVZM", "0596101996", "B002VWNICC", "0596805527"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 921340}, "asin": "B00005JP90", "imUrl": "http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-site/icons/no-img-sm._CB192198896_.gif", "title": "Hollywoodland"}
{"description": "The Dark Knightarrives with tremendous hype (best superhero movie ever? posthumous Oscar for Heath Ledger?), and incredibly, it lives up to all of it.  But calling it the best superhero movie ever seems like faint praise, since part of what makes the movie great--in addition to pitch-perfect casting, outstanding writing, and a compelling vision--is that it bypasses the normal fantasy element of the superhero genre and makes it all terrifyingly real.  Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is Gotham City's new district attorney, charged with cleaning up the crime rings that have paralyzed the city. He enters an uneasy alliance with the young police lieutenant, Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), and Batman (Christian Bale), the caped vigilante who seems to trust only Gordon--and whom only Gordon seems to trust. They make progress until a psychotic and deadly new player enters the game: the Joker (Heath Ledger), who offers the crime bosses a solution--kill the Batman. Further complicating matters is that Dent is now dating Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, after Katie Holmes turned down the chance to reprise her role), the longtime love of Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne.In his last completed role before his tragic death, Ledger is fantastic as the Joker, a volcanic, truly frightening force of evil. And he sets the tone of the movie: the world is a dark, dangerous place where there are no easy choices.  Eckhart and Oldman also shine, but as good as Bale is, his character turns out rather bland in comparison (not uncommon for heroes facing more colorful villains). Director-cowriter Christopher Nolan (Memento) follows his critically acclaimedBatman Beginswith an even better sequel that sets itself apart from notable superhero movies likeSpider-Man 2andIron Manbecause of its sheer emotional impact and striking sense of realism--there are no suspension-of-disbelief superpowers here. At 152 minutes, it's a shade too long, and it's much too intense for kids. But for most movie fans--and not just superhero fans--The Dark Knightis a film for the ages.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B000PC6A3E", "B002ZG981E", "B00G4RD4PQ", "B0039208QM", "B001GMALGY", "B00E2Y0YBK", "B00C2IGQBA", "B0039208JE", "B00H14WTLQ", "B0039208CG", "B0085D3I3K", "B0039208C6", "B000M5AJQI", "B00319ECGK", "B001FB55H6", "B00EIG5M5A", "7020070078", "B00E2Y6AUY", "B00D5FMGGS", "B001OQCV6K", "B0013FBS20", "B000Q6GX5Y", "B001GKJ2FC", "B00FPS79F6", "B001992NUQ", "B004JMSIRC", "B001RIY4WE", "B00DYEN6XC", "B008QZ5PY2", "B001F7MSG6", "B00FAHYNWE", "B00J7PRJXU", "B001AQT0Z4", "B001UV4XEW", "B0083SBJXS", "B00AEFY552", "B00C8RD79O", "B007KAJG3K", "B007L4HET8", "B004EPZ07U", "B007L4HFDI", "B00AEFXKOO", "B000PC0U1W", "B00C6B8TB8", "B00HINFI4K", "B003TT2X6I", "B001KZIRM2", "B002ZG99NG", "B00EZ4M68G", "B004SIP90G", "B003ZHR6RK", "B001GCUO16", "B003TT2X6S", "B00JNEWSLS", "B001F3FUK6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B002ZG981E", "B000PC6A3E"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPY0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pGxSkkz4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Dark Knight [Theatrical Release]"}
{"description": "Italian horror master Mario Bava brought his considerable skills to bear on this hypnotic genre hybrid, creating one of the most eerily atmospheric science fiction films ever made. A spaceship is lured to a mysterious planet, where members of its crew are slaughtered, and their bodies possessed by a near-extinct alien race--a minimalist plot, to be sure, but in the hands of Bava and cinematographer Antonio Rinaldi,Planet of the Vampires(the best-known of this film's many titles) is a near-masterpiece of style over substance. The simplest sets and backdrops are composed with a perfect eye for perspective and color, with sensible spaceship design and memorable costumes that look like they sprang from the futuristic fantasies of an S&M; biker gang. Performances are secondary but effectively low-key, serving to enhance Bava's painterly use of matte work and miniatures. With a surprise twist ending,POTVis an essential addition to anyone's sci-fi collection.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004RPQSVE", "B00FGAKEU0", "B00480OC0C", "B0007R4T26", "B0002V7O2Y", "B000MV8ABI", "B000BB1926", "B00465I1BK", "B00D9EJFZA", "B000EHSVJG", "6305869367", "B0000648YD", "6305944288", "B0000A2ZSS", "B00005K3O6", "B008BWFOXM", "B000UVV23S", "B00008973H", "B000228EJA", "B000KN9F6W", "B0009X770O", "B0024FAG2G", "B00FGAKEEQ", "B00005R1O7", "B008FYZHPG", "B00B94VJYW", "B003J216K4", "B000FVQLKW", "B000E991S4", "B00005O071", "B000787YRW", "B003CNQPO2", "B005HIBWBG", "B0000542CN", "B0000694WH", "B00004Z1FN", "B000C20VNM", "B000RXVNDI", "B0049IHWT6", "B000K0YM18", "B00D9EJFV4", "B000063UR0", "B000RXVNCE", "B000UDGOB6", "B000068TPF", "B001D5C1OO", "B001B9ZVVC", "B000UDGOBG", "B00005NKTH", "B0001I55SS", "B001BSBBNK", "B000UAFDR0", "B00006JDRG", "6305761078", "B001AD54NE", "B00005NSXY", "B0036R92US", "B000S0GYRU", "B00FMVV416", "B00005IAQD", "B004QF71ZW", "B00IQAUO5C", "B003CNQPOC", "B000K7VL56", "B00FERT0PK", "B0000542CO", "B00023P4UQ", "6305772681", "B000067DCX", "B000AYELJ2", "B002E01MI8", "B00009PY4D", "B0007R4T1M", "B00IYJFB2G", "B0047P5FUY", "B000TUDBGG", "B0000A9GHP", "B00AEBB94G", "B00K8EVSVI", "B00000K3U3", "B0057O6IMS", "B0002C9DK4", "B00HT2RTU6", "B00005O06Y", "B00D7AM6M0", "B00076ON28", "B000YDOOHI", "B007UQ8IQU", "B000FFJZO2", "B00008438U", "B00EFYB03S", "B000QGEB1W", "B000HT3PBU", "6305772711", "B000SFJ4K4", "B00508W2Z8", "B004FUPK6U", "B0002C9DJU", "B001HPOJ68", "B000IMUYJM"], "bought_together": ["B00FGAKEU0", "B000BB1926"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004Z1G1", "B004QF721K", "B004RPQSVE", "B00005JKFR"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 35722}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 29.49, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005K3OF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YNW8M5PCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Planet of the Vampires"}

{"description": "Revered as the author of the Declaration of Independence, the most sacred document in American history, yet condemned as a lifelong owner of slaves, Thomas Jefferson remains the enigma that is America. Part One: A young Thomas Jefferson from the Virginia wilderness is transformed by the fire of the Enlightenment into his country's most articulate voice for human liberty. Torn between serene family life at Monticello and his passion for politics, Jefferson suffers heartrending personal loss, even as he gives voice to a new era of democratic government. He then journeys to Paris as U.S. Minister to France for George Washington and supports the rising French Revolution. Part Two: Returning from France, Jefferson strives to preserve the new, fragile American government and helps create the first political party through his bitter struggles with the Federalists. As third President of the United States, he doubles the size of the county with the Louisiana Purchase, but faces controversy and scandal, finally retiring to his beloved Monticello. His last years are spent founding the University of Virginia and re-establishing his friendship with John Adams. By the end of his remarkable life, he had advanced the cause of religious, political, and intellectual freedom everywhere and had changed the course of human events.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BNX4N6", "B000NA21WM", "B000BITUHU", "B000BITUI4", "B000WGWQG8", "B0006Z2L9W", "B000BITU3E", "B00115Q6N8", "B009OE2O70", "B004IY1AUS", "B0013NAML0", "B005QW98AK", "B000BYRCFQ", "B005DJ7B2I", "B0042EJDOO", "B00007GZYC", "B007VYEF04", "B000LLULI4", "B000BITUWK", "B004NJC0R0", "B000BITUIY", "B000XNZ7KM", "B000BITUFC", "B004AR4WSA", "B004MCGNVM", "B00006AUK1", "B000742G6U", "B000E1MXZ0", "B006QVRWD0", "B000G1R402", "B000BITUG6", "B000BITUIO", "B002Q5O6Y8", "B00A2XTHYU", "B000BITUH0", "B0000687BM", "B0007LPS7W", "B004RV711Y", "B000JU7JE6", "B000BYRCDI", "B000IB0DD0", "B000067D1R", "B001684L0A", "B006J6CED0", "B000BMSU9K", "B0047H7Q54", "B0006Z2L6U", "B000BITUHA", "1882886186", "B00B4TAXXK", "B0009IXRIU", "B000R7NBMK", "B00AJER44M", "B00008G72P", "B000BYRCG0", "B0002ZDWS0", "B005TZFZI8", "B000AQKV3K", "B000BITUFW", "B0052YDO3O", "B00DUX292G", "B007TSV4IS", "B00008DDS1", "B000GG4Y5A", "B004M9QNQK", "B000VWZ0L6", "B002BO2R4K", "B000BITUWA", "B000BITUGQ", "B001NY4X1E", "B0007KIFW8", "B009AMANBA", "094045016X", "B0007GP836", "B003C27X44", "B007VYEB44", "B000H0M41Q", "B0021SGO6S", "B00026L8KS", "B0081NAUOO", "B008XAT0YQ", "B001RUEDK0", "B000BITURU", "B00337DRGQ", "B0032LV4LS", "B00EE8AIUQ", "B00LG7VVPO", "0393337766", "B00022Z06K", "B002KLPAZM", "B005ORVN00", "B00A3THVGE", "B000BITUJ8", "B0049TC8CQ", "B00000JYWU", "B00007CVRF", "B0007WFUNI", "0679764410", "B000ANVQ6Y", "B00GMM19ZA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000WGWQG8", "B000BNX4N6", "B000BITUHU", "B009OE2O70"]}, "price": 12.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 163852}, "asin": "B00005MEPP", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BRV830PFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Thomas Jefferson"}

{"description": "Retelling a story that has made it onto the silver screen more than most, this latest adaptation of The Count of Monte Cristo makes yet another swashbuckling attempt to win over a new generation of cinema goers. A dashing James Caviezel takes the role of the Count, who is driven by a desire for revenge after being betrayed by his best friend Fernand (played by a dishevelled Guy Pearce) and landed with 16 years of solitary confinement in Chateau D'If, a damp cavernous prison. Thus the scene is set for a good old-fashioned romp. The trouble with this \"re-imagining\" (to borrow a phrase from Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes) is that it's never quite sure whether to take itself seriously or not. Alexandre Dumas's original story is a traditionally melodramatic tale of deceit and double-crossing, with clear-cut bad guys and a moral lesson to be learned at the end. Here, director Kevin Reynolds appears unsure about whether to stick with tradition or bring the story up to date and turn it into a post-modern play on the old Victorian values and style. When the Count and his heavy-breathing loved one are reunited, their kiss is actually framed as a cameo. Both lead actors are also prone to heavy bouts of overacting, garnishing their performances with exaggerated baroque gestures. Clearly this is a film in which the actors could over-indulge themselves and (almost) get away with it, were it not for the fact that--bar Richard Harris as the \"Priest\"--none of them seem to have the faintest idea about how to conduct themselves in a period drama. This Count of Monte Cristo will leave the audience a little confused as to whether they should cry along with the story or laugh along with the actors. --Nikki Disney On the DVD: The Count of Monte Cristo on disc offers no escape from the dry drawl of director Kevin Reynolds, who features in almost every element of the extensive extras package. With a shy studio disclaimer before his commentary, he's got a refreshingly frank attitude to", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792839137", "6305428077", "B001EAWMGA", "B000U34PM6", "B000CEXGAU", "B00DCRE87O", "B000ARXF96", "B00004YA66", "B0002HOEPI", "B000BFJM26", "B002U0KHNS", "B00BC0JGUW", "B00005NRO0", "B0064MT1L2", "B000A50442", "B000HC2LZS", "1411469488", "B002AK9URM", "076781505X", "0140449264", "B0007N19X2", "B002VWNID6", "0800141601", "B00062IVOY", "0822003260", "B0002235R6", "B000ENC5YW", "B000P0J0EW", "B00006ZXSO", "B000056PMU", "9626340398", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B000056VP4", "B00CHMBQM0", "B005S9EK5Y", "B001ECDVJU", "B000NVT0SO", "B0001NBMEE", "B00006L949", "B00AEFYO5I", "B0002TSZI8", "B00005LOL0", "B0002YLCG0", "B004SIP75S", "B00081U7HC", "B00004TJJV", "0553213504", "B004SIP9RO", "6304765266", "6304711905", "B00096S4DK", "B0006N2EZ0", "B002K0WBXW", "B000093FLA", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00AEFZ2DG", "B00006ZXSK", "B006P0FIGU", "B002GHHHJC", "0783222149", "B00005JM5B", "B000YGDNPO", "B004IK30MI", "B00096S49Y", "B00860YICC", "6304711891", "B00006ZXSI", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00005JMOW", "B00866JL96", "B000LP6KNU", "B00005PJ8T", "B00004WG2F", "B00000G3PA", "6305428115", "6305692688", "B000E1ZBGS", "B001ECDVK4", "B00000F4ZY", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00028HBKM", "B0041SI78O", "B000BITVBA", "B00003CXFV", "B004SIP7ZS", "B001E75QH0", "6305213283", "6305416222", "B00066FB52", "B0034G4P94", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000P0J0DS", "B00DHHWXYY", "6305127646", "6305236569", "B009LDD1H6", "6305128952", "B00005ATZT", "B0074JOUHE", "6304698798"], "bought_together": ["0792839137", "6305428077"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0792839137", "0140449264", "B000CEXGAU", "B000U34PM6"]}, "price": 12.5, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 231677}, "asin": "B000063W1R", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51LYMHVq8EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Count of Monte Cristo [Region 2]"}

{"description": "Brutality and hope intertwine in this quiet coming-of-age story. Set in a Glasgow, Scotland, slum during a 1973 trash collectors' strike, the film follows young James, shaken after accidentally causing the death of a friend, who dreams of moving into newly built council flats. The loosely plotted slice-of-life piece moves between James's family and his friendship with Kenny, a slightly off animal fancier, and the older Margaret Anne. Though the setting is grim, the movie is far from bleak. Even as the trash bags pile up, James takes comfort in something as simple as being combed for head lice. The cast is excellent, and writer-director Lynne Ramsay coaxes astonishingly good performances out of her child actors. Complex and haunting,Ratcatcherholds a silent wish at its center. The DVD includes an interview with Ramsay, and three of her short films.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00020HB32", "B0000DJYNI", "B00HVOFP6W", "B007C3TVEY", "B00005BHW6", "B000F6IOAM", "B00GPPXNLC", "B007N5YJMA", "B000069DOB", "B00GPPXP6A", "B00005V8TD", "B00004W3HG", "B00HE011DE", "B00G6Q4TTA", "B00007CVS3", "B0002JP2OS", "B00BC75H5S", "B0013D8LMC", "B0026VBOJW", "B009YQMN1U", "B009RWRIMA", "B0007989Y8", "B0002KPHZG", "B00GRA7M2G", "B003D3Y64M", "B00005QAPI", "B008Y5OWKW", "B004JPJHKQ", "B00008H2GR", "B0000633SD", "B000K0YLX2", "B004EBT81I", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B00G47C4OI", "B00DPUB59W", "B00005O3V8", "B00005V6N6", "B000BC8SWE", "B004ALIG4M", "B002YMWPUA", "B000A88ERS", "B00009OOFG", "B001TIQT6Q", "B004S801YA", "B007C3TVNA", "B00000IOKV", "B004CIIXC8", "B00007AJF4", "B000E5LEVA", "B00687XNZS", "B00HE010QM", "B000067IY4", "B0007P0X9G", "B000069HZM", "B003152YXC", "B00005JKPT", "B0000AUHQ6", "B000067IY7", "B00IGK6TGU", "B006X96P6U", "B004ODLUIU", "B000NY1E9E", "B00J2PQZBC", "6305428239", "B00000F17A", "B001D8W7F4", "B00F6Y3FT8", "B00BJB2GUQ", "B00000GHZI", "6305257450", "B00009MEKP", "B000I8OOG0", "B00005UQ7R", "B0000633SB", "B00BJB2GSS", "B00DS79HKG", "B0001EFUFK", "B000E6ESTO", "B0007M2234", "B008MPQ0R2", "B009AGEY98", "B00006673L", "0780022343", "B00000F5KH", "B002XUL6RG", "B000G0O5IM", "B00005UQ7Q", "B00005B1ZK", "B000QXDFR6", "B001WLMOHI", "B00005QAPJ", "6305744114", "B000A88EV4", "B001BEK8E2", "B000069HZP", "B00EO2I6W4", "B00B22049W", "B007FDT0LU", "B00CU00J7C", "0780023307"], "bought_together": ["B00020HB32"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007C3TVNA", "6305428239", "B0010X8NF0", "B0000DJYNI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 97250}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.99, "brand": "RAMASY,LYNNE", "asin": "B000069CF9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41WX5VT19XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ratcatcher (The Criterion Collection)"}
{"description": "Before there wasQuincyandThe Practice, there wasRumpole.Rumpole of the Baileyis, quite simply, one of the finest television series, and it has served as a model for all law dramas that followed it. Edgy and satirical,Rumpoleis based on John Mortimer's books of the same name. Esteemed actor Leo McKern portrays the antihero Rumpole, a determined and committed criminal defense barrister whose clients have included three generations of the Timson family, among others, at the Old Bailey (criminal court). As champion of the downtrodden, the self-righteous Rumpole loves to get in trouble with his wife, his peers, the head of chambers, and judges, to name but a few. A connoisseur of Wordsworth, cigars, and cheap liquor, McKern's usually disheveled Rumpole belies the character's dry sense of humor and astute skill as a barrister. His wife, the upwardly mobile Hilda, is played by Peggy Thorpe-Bates, known for her Miss Toliver inAlcatraz Island, and Justice Sir Guthrie Fetherston is played by Peter Bowles, known for his Richard DeVere in TV'sTo the Manor Born.This four-disc set includes all 12 episodes from the first two seasons in their original sequence of stories, plusRumpole's Return, the 1982 two-hour special that started off the third season. Typical of British drama, production values are low, while the caliber of scriptwriting and acting is unsurpassed. A rare example of a television serial that is as appealing and engaging on its 10th viewing as it is on its first.--Erik Macki", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00061QJH6", "B0009S4IEW", "B0000V4712", "B00IK481FO", "B00A8KJLPM", "B005X5XI4C", "B005X5XINI", "B00GWXHYPI", "B00JJRLFTU", "B00DW5IKWK", "B006JY3O2M", "B00IT3KP96", "B003DUBAWQ", "B00GHH9I62", "B00HHYF55C", "B00EV1YZD2", "B00EF0NYVI", "B00A0HT99G", "B00BDSRM4K", "B009D4SFEC", "B00GD7UO6E", "B00D7AM2V0", "B003X2P9B2", "B00016MSSU", "B0083HXKM2", "B00009RDHH", "B00GWXI1F0", "B00GWXI0S8", "B00GWXI2RM", "B005GP7EVC", "B006Z4LP9K", "B00AO1RKFS", "B009DS3VQA", "B009DS5OEM", "B007ISJS0U", "B004AV5H3U", "B009DS6YGO", "B00D7AM2WO", "B000VWX6T4", "B000EMGF3U", "B0028LOT7O", "B00C888LOO", "B00BCXW106", "B001V7UXG2", "B0009S4IN8", "B003YCI1UC", "B0083HXKAY", "B000EDWLTG", "014006768X", "B00JRWDF6I", "B000053VA5", "B009D4RW96", "B005JX89WY", "B000WQWPSM", "B0000ALPJL", "B0028AENSK", "B000PGTPC8", "B0079ILHRG", "B008645ZXY", "B003AND1S2", "0143036114", "B004SI5VUY", "B0009H97IA", "B004MLEYV4", "B00D49YBTA", "B003KSO3R0", "B000060MVK", "B002CJI4WS", "B00ANGICPG", "B00FPPQYXM", "B001O4C6NA", "B00BVMXARG", "B007S0DEB2", "B00096S45S", "B006MK6Y8Y", "B005A1GRSI", "B0002COTDA", "B004D2GMQC", "B00CEBJCF2", "B00CLB7CFM", "B00471JT0K", "B002MUAXIA", "B008RO6PJQ", "B000GIXLWU", "B00GAXASK8", "B008CYDE7C", "B000NDEXO8", "B00GAHG7PE", "B00A27O5AW", "B001JXPC64", "B000AL733G", "B006JY3OBI", "B001S86IYK", "B009YX8MKO", "B0039ZF8MS", "B0000E6XDU", "B001O4C6MQ", "B0050MB3RM", "B000S2B21G", "B001DHXT7U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003X2P9B2", "B00061QJH6", "B0009S4IEW", "B00F1BFRA6"]}, "price": 19.31, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 315084}, "asin": "B000069HPT", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RC9K191YL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rumpole of the Bailey: Complete 1st and 2nd Seasons"}

{"description": "Like the dashing desperado in an old Hollywood Western, rhinestone-in-the-rough Gene Starwind is a self-proclaimed outlaw who lives by a personal code of ethics. His sphere of action is limited to the two-bit planet where he lives with his friend and business partner Jim Hawking, until rebel pirate \"Hot Ice\" Hilda arrives. She gives Jim and Gene the super-ship, theOutlaw Star, and tells them about a fabulous treasure hidden at the Galactic Leyline. The duo sets off, accompanied by beautiful assassin Suzuka, Malfina, an android who bonds with the ship's fussy computer, and, later, the abrasive alien Aisha Clanclan of the Ctarl-Ctarl Empire. They face some nasty enemies: the Kei Pirates, the MacDougall brothers (Harry, a psychotic cyborg, and Ron, a sadistic human), and Lord Hazanko of the 108 Stars pirate gang. The expedition to the enigmatic planet Galactic Leyline becomes a four-way race that pits Gene and his crew against Hazanko, the MacDougals, and a Ctarl-Ctarl battle cruiser. At the Leyline, Gene, Malfina, and Suzuka confront the pasts that shaped their identities. Katsuhiko Chiba's screenplay sometimes staggers, like Gene the morning after a heavy night. But the characters remain true to their natures: they don't turn into smarmy good guys, andOutlaw Stardelivers an engaging, if rather dark brand of comedy-adventure. The cleanup artists on the series do very sloppy work: Gene's features change noticeably from scene to scene.

{"description": "Beneath the living, beyond the dead, they rose from the depths of hell's ocean! In the dark days of World War II, the Nazi High Command ordered its scientists to create the Death Corps, a top secret race of indestructible zombie storm troopers--un-living, unfeeling, unstoppable monstrosities able to kill with their bare hands. No member of this horrific SS unit was ever captured by the Allied forces--and somewhere off the coast of Florida, they have survived. Peter Cushing (The Curse of Frankenstein), Brooke Adams (The Dead Zone), and John Carradine (The Howling) star in this suspenseful and genuinely creepy shocker co-written and directed by Ken Wiederhorn (Return of the Living Dead 2). One of the great horror \"sleepers\" of the '70s, \"Shock Waves\" has now been transferred from the director's own vault print and digitally restored for this premiere DVD release!", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003L1YESE", "B00026PA70", "B00LT1JHLW", "B00KTFJ5F2", "B000TUDBGG", "B000AM6MVO", "B00LNBQ8SI", "B000GIXCLA", "B00LMBURDG", "B0000A9GHP", "B000063K1F", "B00ITZXDDY", "B0036R92US", "B001D5C1R6", "B00LMCDHMS", "B000TGJ89E", "B00LNBQ8UG", "B000TZJCMS", "B000TZJCNW", "B000YKI4U4", "B005ZHBDTK", "B000RXVNCO", "B000FFJZO2", "B0002C9DK4", "B005CVFZ4I", "B00LFN00GU", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B008HSK3PE", "B00HRUQB8Q", "B0009X770O", "B002GPVDMG", "B005CVFZ66", "B0007WQHI0", "B002E01MHY", "B00B94VJYW", "B0016LFUVQ", "B00IA1VKVY", "B000JU7JIW", "B000HXDWNM", "B00L6AW1K0", "B00FUABJJQ", "B002VKB0KG", "B0057O6IMS", "B00FUABK36", "B00DOZNGC2", "B004WMOSKA", "B00H7BJ0C4", "B000068TPF", "B00D9EJFZA", "B0092U7JSU", "B002UR4GDI", "B000FC2GFK", "B00I462XGG", "B00930LHJQ", "B001M0NJ0K", "B002NN7EY2", "B008H1Q3JG", "B000UAFDR0", "B00K6D1R0I", "B00AIANJ3M", "B000RPCJ9I", "B00000F62P"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003L1YESE", "B000RXVNCO", "B000063K1F", "B000AM6MVO"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 432085}, "asin": "B00006FMCB", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CF248XPGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Shock Waves"}

However, silly plot developments and childish splatter effects undo whatever interest is generated by the premise. This time around, the Djinn is summoned by a woman whose boyfriend was crippled in an accident. He assumes the form of her lawyer and offers her the standard three wishes, two of which bring her a healthy settlement and a boost to her sex life. However, the Djinn&#xB9;s generosity comes with a price: when he grants the third wish, more Djinn will be released from Hell to bring destruction to Earth. But in order to do this, he must make the woman love his true form (a horned demon).

{"description": "The prologue to everyPowerpuff Girlsshow explains how the perky threesome were created in Professor Utonium's lab--by a combination of sugar, spice, and everything nice, along with an accidental dash of Chemical X--but how is it that they started fighting crime? Why didn't they just take their superpowers to the playground and use them for fun? And what's behind evil monkey MoJo JoJo's never-ending quest for Powerpuff vengeance? All questions are answered inThe Powerpuff Girls Movie, which details the creation of Blossom (the commander and leader), Bubbles (the joy and laughter), and Buttercup (the toughest fighter) in more depth than ever before, and the result is a speedy, fun joy ride through the girls' early days. At first, the girls are happy-go-lucky, fitting in nicely at Pokey Oaks kindergarten, until a game of tag gets riotously out of hand (destroying the city of Townsville in the process) and they're shunned by the town populace. Alone, they find their only ally in MoJo, a monkey with a peculiarly large brain and a sympathetic nature, but is MoJo really on their side? The 87-minute length doesn't offer the breakneck momentum that regular episodes do, but it's still riotously funny and filled with tons of Powerpuff fighting. Fans may miss the other super villains featured in the show (MoJo's the only bad guy in town, for now), but with the jokes and action coming fast, you'll be pleasantly enraptured by the perky threesome.

{"description": "This delightfully entertaining romantic comedy stars Reese Witherspoon (LEGALLY BLONDE) as sophisticated Melanie Carmichael, a rising New York clothing designer who suddenly finds herself engaged to the city's most eligible bachelor.

The usualBeach Partytrademarks are in place, including real surfing footage (much improved from the first film), Candy Johnson's shimmy dancing, and Annette's modified bikini with mesh-covered cleavage. Music is provided by Dick Dale and a rockin' Little Stevie Wonder, with most of the songs penned by a triumvirate of surf-music royalty: Brian Wilson, Roger Christian, and Gary Usher. As Frankie says, \"Now you swing with me on that, or you don't swing at all.\" We swing.Ski Partytransfers theBeach Partyvibe to snow, with aSome Like it Hotripoff thrown in. Frankie Avalon and Dwayne Hickman go in drag to discover what girls really want, but Deborah Walley and Yvonne Craig put them in the deep freeze.

{"description": "Breaking the mold of previous \"Walking with\" offerings, the BBC'sWalking with Cavemensees Professor Robert Winston follow in the footsteps of ancient man in a series that traces the history of humanity from bipedal ape-men (Australopithecus Aphaeresis) to the awakening of the human mind's potential with Homo Erectus. Over four fascinating half-hour installments, Wilson presents an accessible and populist, but still suitably anthropological study on how apes became human and the traits that we inherited from our earliest ancestors.UnlikeDinosaursandPrehistoric Beasts,Cavemencombines CGI with actors to portray the characters in the story of man. Initially this seems to make it far less technically impressive than the earlier programs--memories of Stanley Kubrick's2001are inevitable--but fortunately the acting is superb and the viewer soon forgets that these are people in monkey suits. The series also makes use of a special effect called \"deep time-lapse\", which shows in a matter of dramatic seconds the thousands of years of geological changes that sped up our ancestors' evolution. Wilson himself takes part in the action as if he is a modern-day naturalist following lions across the Serengeti rather than creatures long extinct. This approach makes for a more immediate as well as poignant interpretation of history: the result is an enlightening and moving tribute to the human journey.--Kristen Bowditch", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005U2KN", "B000BNI9EU", "B0016KHAH4", "B0016OKR2U", "B00AK51Q8U", "B002TCRQ6I", "B000B7HZQY", "B005HIU9G0", "B0000AYL48", "B0035JHYMK", "B00AYV9U8I", "B00FQI1S1G", "B00017LVSM", "B001CIOCP8", "B00120TJFE", "B0083VP2KQ", "B000GIXLU2", "B002AS461Y", "B00003Q43D", "B000UPMZ44", "B0036K9CJ6", "B004QSQMMW", "B003H8F43K", "B0014VPFIG", "B00008AOWU", "B00316DDU4", "B000NO2416", "B000VD5I1C", "B00003CXAF", "B00B1LN8YC", "B000VD5I0S", "B002NN7ETC", "B004K4FUKW", "B000BKVLA2", "B0007MAO0W", "B004QSQMJ0", "B0000YEDYU", "B000OIOPPE", "B004LGGXGE", "B000JBXHKU", "B00BQI43E4", "B006ENHGLS", "B00153ZQY6", "B00126808K", "B000VD5I12", "B002C39T2I", "B0055HK6X4", "0792271343", "B000WVPXAE", "B00331RHEU", "B001PS1ISY", "B00005MKL5", "0789497751", "B009LA1QZS", "B005HP2J66", "B001OLP2TI", "B0030BS1F2", "B00308BAOO", "B004DURSNA", "B008I34ZMA", "B000XCK0MS", "B001BOIWJA", "B0015XHR5W", "B000EOTEM2", "B004FN26HI", "B00018D3ZA", "B003X2P976", "B000CSTK7O", "B001HB1K32", "B005DJ7B00", "B0039ZBM14", "B001IBCS3M", "B00005ICEC", "B0009E3234", "6305558167", "B00005RG6J", "B006QVRWD0", "B000BB1520", "B0028ERBSA", "B00BCV3IN2", "B0047HXMMU", "B000BITU3E", "B00005AB62", "B005OCJIRK", "B005OCJHXU"], "bought_together": ["B00005U2KN", "B000BNI9EU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00153ZQY6", "B00005U2KN", "B000BNI9EU", "B00AK51Q8U"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 124056}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.07, "brand": "", "asin": "B00008AOWQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51wY95DvN9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Walking With Cavemen"}

{"description": "Deep Space Nine's fifth season was a turning point from which there was no going back. Character and information overload took over, and the complicated twists and turns in the build up to war either hooked viewers securely, or sent them away with a headache. The Klingon faction instigated by Worf's arrival was occasionally played for laughs, but mostly their hardheaded personalities made all efforts at diplomacy moot. In the opening episode a chilling possibility is proposed as to what might be: have the Changelings infiltrated already and replaced key personnel? Some fans saw this as a flawedX-Files-style development. Nevertheless it sowed a seed of insidious suspicion, affecting all the principal casts' relationships with one another, even allowing Odo and Quark an opportunity to confess a degree of friendship. Expanding on the new theme of duplication, the crew also made numerous trips to their mirror-universe counterparts.As well as new uniforms and the milestone 100th episode, Nana Visitor and Alexander Siddig got to comically disguise the arrival of their child during filming. More laughs came from the fan favorite \"Trials and Tribble-ations,\" with CG allowing Sisko and crew to interact with Kirk and a cameo from Leonard Nimoy. Avery Brooks began taking a backseat, partly a result of the now-overcrowded cast. Although Sisko's destiny would be foreshadowed by his first vision and the introduction of the Pah-wraiths, the Captain was in an increasingly sulky mood. Brooks only directed one episode, allowing room for regulars LeVar Burton and Rene Auberjonois to do more behind the camera. Joining them were Alexander Siddig, Michael Dorn and even Andrew Robinson.

{"description": "Cole Porter's masterworkKiss Me, Katewas revived in a splashy production that played on Broadway in 1999 then in London, where this version was filmed in front of a live audience in 2002.  Broadway veterans Brent Barrett and Rachel York play pompous Fred Graham and feisty Lilli Vanessi, respectively, the couple whose roles in Shakespeare'sThe Taming of the Shrewmirror their offstage feud. The play-within-a-play format is reflected in a score that has both contemporary '50s songs (\"Too Darn Hot\") and Bard-inspired stage songs (\"I've Come to Wive It Wealthily in Padua\").  Other songs such as \"Wunderbar,\" \"So in Love,\" \"Why Can't You Behave?,\" \"Always True to You (In My Fashion),\" and \"Brush Up Your Shakespeare\" are among Porter's best-loved melodies and wittiest lyrics.  Nancy Anderson and Michael Berresse (the lone principal still remaining from theBroadway revival cast) sing and dance up a storm as the secondary couple Lois and Bill, and Teddy Kempner and Jack Chissick steal scenes as the gangsters.  Recommended for fans of musicals, though it's not the most family-friendly choice due to gender conflicts and stereotyping.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004H83IKU", "B00003OP0U", "B00008AOWI", "B0000C23HY", "B00J2T18EW", "B00000JL7T", "B00004W5VC", "B00IBQ5M1W", "B00JM5CAHA", "B00001PE59", "B00GXD6UMK", "B008SBXFUU", "B0013Z7RUC", "B001PO550A", "B004H0M2X2", "B0001FR55C", "B00JAOW3MA", "B00BX8PG3Y", "B000093NR3", "B00GXD6UNO", "B0028SVXVM", "B000FIHNHK", "B00004RFEZ", "B000NTM9ZM", "630530209X", "B0060QSGJ0", "B00CQUNSJM", "1557830665", "B00006G8HO", "B000XULO5C", "B00004XMTJ", "B00BDSRB2S", "1451684568", "B000ATQYVK", "B00000JMKN", "B00005LIN0", "B00BG4R8SG", "B002M2Z3RE", "B000VKL6RK", "0802122388", "B000BITUNE", "B001B51B9M", "B009M1HJ3O", "0881885770", "B000008HD3", "B007RTO59E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00008AOWI", "B001PO550A", "B004H83IKU", "B00000JL7T"]}, "price": 52.97, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 203758}, "asin": "B00008NFR6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CvLTwUbxL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Kiss Me, Kate"}
{"description": "The second season ofAngelsaw the cult vampire show finally stand on its own fromBuffy the Vampire Slayer, assembling all the members of the show's core cast, transferring the action to a fashionably run-down L.A. hotel, and bringing in a fewBuffycharacters from Angel's history to further establish the moody vampire's own mythology. Moving their Angel Investigations to posher digs, Angel (David Boreanaz), Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter), and Wesley (Alexis Denisof) were soon joined by street fighter (J. August Richards)&#x96;-and by street fighter, of course we mean demon street fighter. But just as this group was solidifying, up popped Angel's old love, Darla (the fantastic Julie Benz), freshly arrived in L.A. from a hell dimension&#x85; just in time to be turned into a vampire again by her old cohort, Drusilla (Juliet Landau), and lure Angel into abandoning his newly formed team. It was the best and worst of times forAngelin its second year, for while the basis was being set for the show's stellar third and fourth seasons, dramatic tension was diluted by Angel's going solo and the necessary (but plot-debilitating) flashbacks to various points in Angel's history. However, just when it seemed everything was about to fly out the window,Angel's creative team threw its characters for a loop--literally--by transporting them to the demon dimension of Pylea, a medieval-style fantasyland populated by monsters and humans alike. It shouldn't have worked, as hokey as it was... but it did, thanks to crack storytelling, sharp dialogue, and the sheer joy the actors unleashed, especially the gifted and fiendishly funny Carpenter. The second half of the season also saw the addition of two ofAngel's best characters: the horned Lorne (Andy Hallett), a green demon with a penchant for karaoke, and Fred (Amy Acker), a physicist trapped in Pylea who helped the gang engineer their escape. With these two in tow,Angelbegan to soar. --Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000I0QLRI", "B000I0QLQY", "B000I0QLRS", "B000I0QLS2", "B000EHSVM8", "B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVMS", "B000EHSVN2", "B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVLE", "B000EHSVKK", "B0006IUE16", "B0009W5J4Q", "B0046XG48O", "B007H9CNOI", "B000B5XOW0", "B000CCBCGM", "B0024FAR66", "B000HD1482", "B000OIOPHC", "B00133QNSG", "B000JLTRIG", "B00006J3WH", "B000ERVJM2", "B0002XVKMM", "B000GG4Y6O", "B00133QNS6", "B000BOH990", "B000RO6JYK", "B00AMDA2QC", "B00IWTVDUW", "B000O77SMW", "B001B7CNZ6", "B000O77SN6", "B000HT3P60", "B00344EAQO", "B001992NWO", "B000GG4Y28", "B0000AQS0F", "1593078226", "B00466H3CW", "B000QDLSR0", "B009LDD4V4", "B002JVWR4U", "B009LDCXNY", "B0053O89IS", "B000BOH986", "B000GIW9GO", "B001L1S1OY", "B000BOH98G", "B00133QNRW", "B000CNE0SS", "B0013DZNAA", "B002N5N5MK", "B000FP2OPY", "B000X5SPBI", "B001MVWRNE", "B0024FAD9C", "1595826106", "B000T9OP7G", "B00129W6LE", "B000FIMG68", "B001FB4W0C", "B000NOKFGW", "B0041ONFJE", "B0009X76XW", "B003L77G8I", "B001MVWRNO", "B00008KA57", "B000F8O2Q0", "B000FL7CAK", "B00HUPC5X8", "B004R35DLW", "B000R7GKQE", "B002JVWRAO", "B000G75ARU", "B004YM6JI2", "B009LDCWWG", "B001QE99AQ", "B002JVWR4A", "B003L77GH4", "B003L77GGK", "B004X60QWO", "B001OQCVCY", "B0001JXPPC", "B003PGNBO8", "B00005JNOG", "B0085KGG96", "B00008KA5A", "B002CLKP00", "B006LG74Q0", "B002BWP2JO", "B0009ZE9Y4", "B00JF5GAZA", "B000AQN894", "B000R7I44K", "B002DLB1H0", "B0032JTV6A", "B002BWP2IK", "B004SMDJ9U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000I0QLQY", "B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVM8", "B000I0QLRI"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 143420}, "asin": "B00008YGRT", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41D8962TGZL._SX300_.jpg", "title": "Angel - Season Two"}
{"description": "Tough but not swaggering, serious but not solemn,S.W.A.T.won over its 1970s television audience with several unexpectedly interesting elements: A degree of storytelling sophistication; visually exciting, guerrilla-like street violence; and a subtle but determined fascination with the psyches of the show's five principal characters. To a non-viewer,S.W.A.T.looked like a fatuously reassuring, law-and-order shill in the aftermath of the Vietnam war and Watergate. In reality, creator-producer Robert Hammer (a Peabody Award winner for the 1979 POW TV drama,When Hell Was in Session) managed to make an ideal, mid-'70s Aaron Spelling cop show with an extra emphasis on the human factor in peacekeeping.Spun off from an earlier Spelling series,The Rookies,S.W.A.T.was the story of Special Weapons and Tactics, an elite branch of the Los Angeles Police Department assigned the most critical cases of urban violence in an American era of cult terrorism, snipers, assassinations, traumatized war veterans, and organized crime. Considering what the S.W.A.T. team is up against in every episode--shooters with sophisticated weaponry, psychotic revolutionaries, vulnerable takeover targets (nuclear reactors, etc.)--one might have expected the show to be swallowed up in gadgetry and fancy police protocol for extreme emergencies. But from the pilot (technically, a two-hourRookiesepisode not included in this set) on,S.W.A.T.was clearly much more interested in the way team leader Lieutenant Dan \"Hondo\" Harrelson (Steve Forrest), Sergeant David \"Deacon\" Kay (Rod Perry), and officers Street (Robert Urich), Luca (Mark Shera), and McCabe (James Coleman) tried to understand the modern world even while keeping its meanest tendencies in check.Inventive stories with occasional twists and appealing guest stars (James Keach, Cameron Mitchell, Annette O'Toole) keep one glued to the 13 episodes contained here. Among the best: \"A Coven of Killers,\" starring Sal Mineo as a Charles Manson-like monster; \"Jungle War,\" featuring Mitchell as a career cop and war vet facing an emotional breakdown; and \"The Bravo Enigma,\" an apocalyptic tale of a curiously likable hit man (Christopher George) unknowingly spreading a plague through L.A.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0077T5SOA", "B000PMGS5E", "B00803LRK6", "B00HZMZ286", "B00018D3RI", "B0009UC80G", "B00023GGAI", "B00KTZALDC", "B000HEVZ7Q", "B000CELOV8", "B0009UC80Q", "B007KW5M6I", "B000LC4C60", "B0007A0F4Y", "B001B187C0", "B00000F6RL", "B00005JNHU", "B001J2XROY", "B00266PDZ8", "B00006J6XH", "B002OOWKVM", "B0028S1100", "B003QS0E54", "B003IRUFB6", "B00IXPWGIS", "B005LFQRTC", "B0034BAKL6", "B003W5C0TY", "B001JAHQ0M", "B000LV6VZQ", "B00005JNHT", "B000XJD3JS", "B00DYQ1GBE", "B000VS6R30", "B004M9ZI0C", "B005SQRYQY", "B00005JO3P", "B006UKX63W", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B0062VL4YW", "B000E1EHPY", "B00AA8Q0JM", "B00I87U9H6", "B0014VPFKY", "B002WQ79A4", "B001675ZJM", "B000RZIGSQ", "B000UX6TJI", "B008JEJV2W", "B0083TUE6A", "B000SMNK16", "B00I87U8UE", "B00308B170", "B000ASDFIG", "B003XMKUEI", "B0014FAIXE", "B000HWZ4HU", "B00GC2KI2U", "B00IU6HPIQ", "B00JEZWRE4", "B003K1NGXE", "B002XKKX8E", "B00005JNHS", "B00ESFUED6", "B005DLN1LG", "B00005JO4F", "B008H6GHII", "B00008WJEZ", "B005FQ2HBO", "B008OR5X6M", "B000A0GXGK", "B001S86IZE", "B003XMKU3Y", "B0041SI7A2", "B001FT4PEW", "B005EVY8NA", "B001E6HUW0", "B00553K9NA", "B000GNOSHW", "B000O77SNG", "B0030VANJO", "B005GYZR3U", "B009911708", "B000AQ68SW", "B00008EYA5", "B00E96AYYS", "B004IB04S0", "B000GW8UAE", "B0089BSLKS", "B0096W46PS", "B00005JNJ1", "B008X8U83K", "B000NOIX66", "B006CR2OWM", "B008IG0G7K", "B003CNQPMY", "B000WQWPSM", "B0007YMWGY", "B001D68NFO", "B0014FAIVG"], "bought_together": ["B0077T5SOA", "B000PMGS5E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00008EYA5", "B0077T5SOA", "B00HZMZ286", "B000PMGS5E"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 76276}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 16.24, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00008YLVB", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q4YE439SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "S.W.A.T. - The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "A hugely popular 1974 weekly TV series that's been completely restored for this collector's edition,Little House on the Prairieis based on Laura Ingalls Wilder's bestselling books and follows the Ingalls family through the trials and tribulations of pioneer life in the 1870s. The series opens with the extremely poor family settling in Plum Creek, near the town of Walnut Grove, Minnesota, and follows them as they struggle to build a house, plow and plant their land, and become part of their small town's community. Ma (Karen Grassle) and Pa (Michael Landon) are good, honest folk with a healthy compassion for others. But it seems like every day brings a new trial for them and their children, Mary, Laura, and Carrie (Melissa Sue Anderson, Melissa Gilbert, and Sidney and Lindsay Greenbush). A freak hailstorm ruins an entire crop of wheat, their newly born son dies, a bout of the plague threatens the entire town of Walnut Grove, the family's barn catches fire, a devastating blizzard looms, but the family perseveres and they never lose their faith in God or their belief in the goodness of each other and the people around them. Despite the hardships of everyday pioneer life, Pa and his family find plenty of time to help others. They come to the aid of a local girl suffering the effects of one leg being shorter than the other, Ma fills in for an ailing schoolteacher and inspires a previously unreachable pupil, and Ma and Pa band together to protect a young boy from harm at the hands of his drunken father. This series paints a striking picture of the difficulties of American pioneer life and the courage and resilience of pioneer men, women, and children. It's also a powerful portrait of a close-knit, giving family and the life-affirming lessons they learn and share each day. Michael Landon deserves much of the credit for the show's success as he filled the triple role of star, producer, and writer. Favorite episodes in season one include \"Country Girls,\" in which Mary and Laura attend their first-ever day of school; \"The Award,\" when Mary's studiousness leads to a fire in the family barn; the two-hour \"The Lord Is My Shepherd\" episode about the birth and death of young Charles Jr. and its profound effect on Laura; and \"Survival,\" in which a Native American friend saves the Ingalls family in a blizzard.

{"description": "Elijah Wood has one of his first post-Frodoleading roles in this mild-mannered comedy (the title of which wasTry Seventeenin its film festival showings). He's a 17-year-old college dropout who moves into a funky old apartment building and becomes intrigued by his wacky neighbors. Mandy Moore plays the self-absorbed actress across the hall, andRun Lola Rungoddess Franka Potente is a cranky photographer. The movie has a few surprises (the casting seems to suggest a teenybopper romance for Wood and Moore, but not so fast), although the energy level rarely perks up and it's pretty thin on actual narrative happenings. Wood's tendency toward fantasy is an especially tired device. A furtive sense of humor, plus the big adoring closeups of the highly photogenic leading ladies, provides the low-key interest.

{"description": "Scarface(1983)This sprawling epic of bloodshed and excess, Brian De Palma's update of the classic 1932 crime drama by Howard Hawks, sparked controversy over its outrageous violence when released in 1983.Scarfaceis a wretched, fascinating car wreck of a movie, starring Al Pacino as a Cuban refugee who rises to the top of Miami's cocaine-driven underworld, only to fall hard into his own deadly trap of addiction and inevitable assassination. Scripted by Oliver Stone and running nearly three hours, it's the kind of film that can simultaneously disgust and amaze you (critic Pauline Kael wrote \"this may be the only action picture that turns into an allegory of impotence\"), with vivid supporting roles for Steven Bauer, Michelle Pfeiffer, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, and Robert Loggia.--Jeff ShannonScarface(1932)Howard Hawks'sScarfacewas one of the first \"talkies\" to reclaim the fluidity of the late-silent masterpieces, while also tapping into a feral new energy that came with talking smart and moving smarter on the motion picture screen. Outgunning such contemporaries asLittle CaesarandThe Public Enemy--in terms of both its ferocious death-dealing and dynamic style--the movie was interfered with by censors and kept out of circulation for decades thanks to its eccentric producer, Howard Hughes. It remains the gold standard among classic gangster pictures. Paul Muni's portrayal of Al Capone surrogate Tony Camonte etched a screen original: a merciless assassin who's not only reflexively criminal but pre-civilized, almost pre-evolutionary, a simian shadow ready to rub out the world if he can't have it for his own. This is still one of the greatest, darkest, most deeply exciting films American cinema has produced. Those demonically ubiquitous X's--starting with that titular scar gouged into Tony's cheek--rival \"Rosebud\" for resonance.--Richard T.

{"description": "Here are four strong entries (each beautifully restored by the UCLA Film and Television Archive) from the peak of Basil Rathbone's prolific, seven-year run as a definitive Sherlock Holmes for the big screen. Three of these films were released in 1944 alone, beginning with the grippingPearl of Death, a then-contemporary update (set in the World War II years, as with most of the Rathbone-Holmes features) of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's \"The Six Napoleons.\"A reluctant Holmes agrees to help a London museum recover a stolen, rare pearl. But the investigation takes a strange turn when the great detective and his sidekick, Dr. Watson (Nigel Bruce), find their mystery linked to a series of odd murders involving the destruction of porcelain china. Typically, \"Pearl of Death\" has its share of inside jokes for true Sherlockians, including Holmes's declaration, \"If I'm wrong, I'll move to Sussex and raise bees.\" Of course, that's exactly what Doyle's most famous character did upon retirement.The Scarlet Clawis an original screenplay with elements loosely inspired by Doyle's \"The Adventure of the Dancing Men.\" A skeptical Holmes and Watson attend a meeting of the Royal Canadian Occult Society in Canada, but are soon looking into a killing spree attributed to a fanciful marsh monster. Fantastic events are soon supplanted by an even stranger horror concerning a master actor bent on revenge.The Spider Womanemploys details of Holmes's apparent death and resurrection between \"The Final Problem\" and its follow-up, \"The Adventure of the Empty House.\" But the movie takes a different direction when a bizarre series of late-night \"pajama suicides\" finds Holmes probing the involvement of a femme fatale. Of the quartet of features in this set (all produced and directed by the energetic Roy William Neill)Spider Womanhas the most vivacity and familiar textures from Doyle's canon.Finally, \"The House of Fear,\" adapted from \"The Five Orange Pips,\" is a chamber mystery concerning successive murders of the members of an elite club, the Good Comrades. On film, the tale seems a bit ludicrous, but its conclusion is among the most startling in the Rathbone films. There's also a fair amount of comedy between Watson and Inspector Lestrade's bumbling ways.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000EMYKY", "B0000AOV8O", "B0001DCYB4", "B0001DCYBE", "B002EOVXAQ", "B002IJA66E", "B000YDMPCO", "B001ARDBXK", "B000EXZFRQ", "B00383XZP8", "B0000APVBL", "B0000APVBR", "B000EXDSAW", "B002EOVXAG", "B000GY728I", "B0000APVBM", "B000QGDJG0", "B00009WVO2", "B003UAKECG", "B002OQZE6S", "B001TE6P78", "B00005LC4K", "B00598O9RI", "B0000AUHPC", "B0001FGBZW", "B00598OA7W", "B0000EMYKN", "B007JWKLMO", "B00009NHC0", "B00K6D1RVW", "B0000WN0PA"], "bought_together": ["B0000AOV8O", "B0000EMYKY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EXZFRQ", "B002EOVXAQ", "B002EOVXAG", "B002OQZE6I"]}, "price": 51.08, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 190829}, "asin": "B0000APVBY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5120C41DQ9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Sherlock Holmes Collection, Vol. 2 (The House of Fear/The Spider Woman/Pearl of Death/The Scarlet Claw)"}

{"description": "Fans of comedian Dave Attell's charmingly seedy TV seriesInsomniacwill be pleased by this two-disc set, which features twice the episodes included in the previous set as well as some amusing extras. This time around, the ever-garrulous Attell visits nine U.S. cities for lowbrow fun after dark, as well as Amsterdam to commit each of the Seven Deadly Sins in a single evening. In addition to the usual bar-hopping, he also attends Miami's debauched FantasyFest, cruises with strippers in Las Vegas and deals with perpetual daylight in Alaska, all of which feature the nudity and strong language missing from the broadcast versions. However, the show's highlights remain Attell's repartee with people on the street, where his quick and salty wit takes center stage. Comedy Central's DVD set includes audio commentary by Attell and his producers on several episodes, a handful of inconsequential deleted scenes, and clips from some of the network's other programs, includingCrank Yankers.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000087F5T", "B000CSUNKW", "B000WPE8P6", "B000089CT7", "B0085A9K12", "B002L9N4Z6", "B0019F030C", "B004GIIHYI", "B00022LIMA", "B001FRNB94", "B002N1AEFA", "B00CFK5HS8", "B000C3L2NE", "B001J66JZ4", "B000I2IRIM", "B00008PHCU", "B00008EY6Q", "B00BF0CGT2", "1455526304", "B004B93RC4", "B001GQ3GHG"], "bought_together": ["B000087F5T", "B000WPE8P6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000087F5T", "B000CSUNKW", "B000089CT7"]}, "price": 17.96, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Comedy & Spoken Word"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 135495}, "asin": "B0000D8L4N", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519MG3SVCCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Best of Insomniac Uncensored (Vol. 2)"}

An answer to the violent and militant blaxploitation films of the period, these films, each directed by Poitier, were theBarbershopof their day.

{"description": "Partly inspired by 1948'sThe Big Clockand its nominal 1987 remakeNo Way Out, the Denzel Washington thrillerOut of Timeis quite enjoyable if you ignore its implausible plotting. Like those earlier films, this reunion of Washington and hisDevil in a Blue Dressdirector Carl Franklin is about a man--in this case the police chief (Washington) of sleepy Banyan Key, Florida--who falls into a trap set by others, sinks into legal quicksand of his own making, and must race the clock to extricate himself from a series of incriminating setbacks. The Florida setting adds welcome character to the potboiler plot, and Washington's screen-cred makes it easy to overlook the absurdities of rookie writer David Collard's screenplay. Eva Mendes is sharp and sensible as Washington's estranged wife (do you think they'll reconcile for a happy ending?), and the talented John Billingsley--whose portrayal of \"Dr. Phlox\" on TV'sEnterpriseis vastly underrated--is a constant delight as Washington's medical examiner, beer buddy and wily co-conspirator. It's hardly a classic, butOut of Timegoes well with a big tub of popcorn.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JPD0", "B000GFLKF8", "B00005JN0W", "B000244GCC", "B002LMV7R0", "6304884400", "B002VWNIEA", "B00005JKWX", "B000OT6V0K", "B005LAIGRS", "0783240295", "B0050MB4OO", "6304765258", "B00BTYOYG2", "B002ZG99TA", "B00005JA9F", "B0006210ZG", "B0000542CJ", "078324228X", "0767818075", "B002CPMB9O", "B002ZG997C", "B00AFEXRME", "B00441GZ1Y", "B002GHHHN8", "B00096S49Y", "B000N60HAO", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B005LAIGLE", "B002AT8K9W", "B00005JLRZ", "B00125WAWS", "B003BV8I3Q", "B0001VTPUO", "B008E70EES", "B0013J55B6", "B0007KZQAM", "B001JV5AZE", "B002O3Z4WK", "0800141806", "B000F8DV1M", "B002NZK5UU", "B00AEFXT1S", "B002AT8KAG", "B00BB67UNW", "B00J5G1P2W", "B002DU39GW", "B000G5SILC", "B00441GYXI", "0767810872", "B000ZS8GWQ", "B008FCX2D2", "B00AEBB86A", "B00008EYA5", "B00DZP1C2W", "B001UV4XRY", "0790730979", "6305428115", "0790736411", "6305161933", "B0006GAI5U", "B00BEIYHO2", "B008B9JTLI", "0783229402", "B001KRVLCI", "B003L20IG0", "B008JFUNKU", "B00AEBB8LA", "B00JA3RVG4", "B000VG66XS", "B0006GANOQ", "B00009L1TA", "B000R4SMCW", "B005OK721G", "B000EGDB10", "B00HEPC0TS", "B001L57ZYM", "B000069HZP", "B000P0J0EM", "B00007AJG1", "B00015YVDG", "6305505802", "B00005JMWP", "B004EPYZP8", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B000RO9Q7W", "B000244GCW", "B007EQR0D8", "B00J2MPZQG", "B00005JN0T", "B000QXDCLU", "B000P0I4O4", "B00005JNQA", "B005FUTBWS", "B00005JKQS", "0790742004", "B005YFGJFG", "B0002J4X2K", "B000N3SRO0", "B00013RC66"], "bought_together": ["B00005JPD0", "B00005JN0W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JN0W", "B00005JKWX", "B00005JPD0", "B000GFLKF8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 29468}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.98, "brand": "Mgm/Ua Studios", "asin": "B0000VJG72", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51bhUc7kE0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Out of Time"}

Koji Yakusho, the happy-foot husband inShall We Dance, plays a weary detective on a baffling murder case, which paradoxically becomes even more puzzling as the solution begins to emerge. Kurosawa's use of empty spaces, and his uncanny command of the soundtrack (the eerie collection of hums and drones would win David Lynch's approval) makes for a shivery experience... though not one interested in resolving itself in a conventional manner. And why should it? At some terrible point in this movie you realize that catching the bad guy isn't going to make Kurosawa's poisoned world any cleaner or safer.

Otherwise, it's at the level of every other slasher movie, video game or no video game, in which stupid people do stupid things to keep themselves in harm's way.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000E5N69S", "B000T5O49O", "B0002KQNL8", "B000EQ5V8G", "B002IW8V2C", "B0002ABURA", "B00005JOWW", "B00AIZ2FPK", "B00116GEHU", "B000068IEV", "B000WC389G", "B001221DUQ", "B00GHH9IIA", "B00CERJI5U", "B000M9BPFI", "B00006FI0R", "B007XF0XUW", "B0000E2R6P", "B00D7AM6M0", "B0092U7JSU", "B00441GYVA", "B000AM6OQ2", "B00GOYHSBU", "B00009MGEM", "B008G4T7W4", "B000TUDIL4", "B001AR0D5Y", "B000A2X3U2", "B008DL4LQ2", "B003VE9WP6", "B004AC6PV2", "B00FUABJJQ", "B002AS45VK", "B0013D8LAE", "B00005RHGK", "B004P7CM9Q", "B00005LQ0Z", "B000AXWHSA", "B004P7CN7W", "B002XJDUV2", "B00AZTUUQK", "B00006LPHA", "B00000K3TO", "B00079Z9WI", "B0001611DI", "B000OYCMLM", "B001GCUO0W", "B004WOAGG8", "B001QMCJ0U", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B001D262LA", "B00317LM8S", "B004P7CN3G", "B000SAGGSC", "B00AEFY2LO", "B0002C9DK4", "B004EI2NP4", "B003THSXJ6", "B0036R92US", "B001UDS4BS", "B00AEFY37C", "B00AEFY31S", "B000AWYOGE", "0783227434", "B003ZZ7TPG", "B000KJU1KK", "B0002J4X3O", "B003VMFWXO", "B000BBOUUE", "B0021L8UXA", "B00008LUNW", "B0053TWVA0", "B002EOVXBK", "B00AAQ7JZI", "6305258287", "B000GCFO0I", "B008B089RM", "B00007JZUQ", "B000ZS8GWQ", "B0053TWV46", "B002G1WPG8", "B001M9ELOY", "B0001CNRLG", "B000A6T1ZY", "B005GT3X68", "6305943133", "B00IA1VKVY", "B00AEFYV9W", "B0013D8LA4", "B000G1ALDY", "6305127654", "6305090564", "B001L2ZSJO", "B00EMAGKNU", "B00GBHNP7G", "B0031U8OEK", "B00CHMBQCU", "B00AEFYXQI", "B00AEFY2WI", "6302020867"], "bought_together": ["B000E5N69S"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002OVO18A", "B002ZG98LO", "B000FFJZO2", "B000WCQWR6"]}, "price": 4.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 46008}, "asin": "B0000YEE6C", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41368N2BMEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "House of the Dead"}
{"description": "You don't have to be a New England Patriots fan to enjoy this 3-hour DVD from NFL Films, but it sure helps. The highlight is found in the extras--every play from Super Bowl XXXVIII (the best ever, dare we say?), in which the Patriots prevailed 32-29 over the Carolina Panthers. Using the TV feed for visuals with the radio feed with Dick Stockton, you can view every play in just over an hour with a great deal of the excitement still intact. On-screen graphics and a few replays keep you in the action, and only purists will resist the chance to relive the exciting game in this condensed format. Other extras include in-depth game analysis, highlights from \"media day,\" and post-game interviews (some right on the field). Unlike previous highlight packages, there are no performances from the pre-game or notorious halftime show. The main hour-long program recaps the Patriots 17-win season with NFL Films' winning mix of excellent photography, invigorating music, tightly edited player interviews, and the poetic mastery of narrator Harry Kalas.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006Q94BY", "B00005T7G1", "B000RW3Z0I", "B001CW8020", "B0015XHR5M", "B000UUX2QY", "B000679N6E", "B0009MW5PC", "B0002V7U2S", "B0049S1NX2", "B00EYMNSX6", "B000WMA74U", "B000KWZ1PW", "B00DBPBQAE", "B0012IX3CQ", "B0040ZN9LS", "B002VXEBYA", "B005COLF9Y", "B001D7T45G", "B00186DF5W", "B0013LCO6S", "B000E5N6MK", "B000WOSAZQ", "B000X3UIYW", "B0009IXRLW", "B005TZFZ8S", "B006JN86XU", "B00337OPTO", "B0009NSCT4", "B00GVFJ5PE", "B005X7H9Y0", "B00GSTHD48", "B00KGA8DCQ", "B0029ZUQ8A", "B001OQ17SI", "B0009NSCSA", "B005N4DQ8Q", "B00186DF5C", "B00EYMNV4M", "B0013XZ6TS", "1600786367", "B000GYI34K", "B004TPJN1O", "B0015NQEMY", "B001GP5TOK", "B000RPD0IC", "B000R3VBDA", "B0089BSNCO", "B008924FKM", "B00EYMNUR0", "B00287Z1DO", "B000MS42ZY", "B000WMA75E", "B001BSBC0W", "B0010V4VKI", "B00AP2DDT8", "B001UNSZW6", "B00H83OGZM", "B0029ZUQ80", "B00065GIK0", "B00I39BQK8", "B001BRXEA4", "B00127OVPU", "B00DBPBP8C", "B00EQ02HNI", "B000HLDF9A", "B00020W0X8", "B007PF5U8A", "B0002DRDE6", "B000PAAK00", "B0009GX1E2", "B003DC8838", "B000FTCLTO", "B001BRZRI6", "B00GVFJ4SW", "B0000C8AO2", "B000YZENPO", "B008WAM36E", "B0002V7U28", "B001UNSZWG", "B001Y7CW1I", "B00D3MXYKU", "B002BIULOO", "B001EZE5JM", "B003M8NGPS", "B000S2XD8G", "B001BGS176", "B00DBPBPXW", "B000H6SXNI", "B005Y1C3TQ", "B000BZWN7C", "B0001WTWYM", "B0049985Q4", "B0001Z37IQ", "B0030E5PXU", "B0002DRDIC", "B0002V7TZG"], "bought_together": ["B0006Q94BY", "B000RW3Z0I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0006Q94BY", "B000RW3Z0I", "B0002V7U2S", "B001CW8020"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 136898}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.49, "brand": "Unknown", "asin": "B00011D1GS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J5P308RCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "NFL Films - Super Bowl XXXVIII - New England Patriots Championship Video"}

Obviously working through some semi-autobiographical issues regarding \"women of a certain age,\" writer-director Nancy Meyers brings adequate credibility and above-average intelligence to what is essentially (but not exclusively) a fantasy premise, in which an aging lothario who's always dated younger women (Jack Nicholson, more or less playing himself) falls for a successful middle-aged playwright (Diane Keaton) who's convinced she's past the age of romance, much less sexual re-awakening. As long as old pals Nicholson and Keaton are on screen discussing their dilemma or discovering their mutual desire,Something's Gotta Giveis terrific, proving (in case anyone had forgotten) that Hollywood can and should aim for an older demographic. Myers falls short with the sitcom device of a younger lover (Keanu Reeves) who wants Keaton as much as Nicholson does; it's believable but shallow and too easily dismissed. Myers also skimps on supporting roles for Frances McDormand, Amanda Peet, and Jon Favreau, but thankfully this is one romantic comedy that doesn't pander to youth. Mature viewers, rejoice!--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0038N9WKU", "0767811100", "B000MQC9H4", "B000YAF4MA", "B000OCZA04", "B0038N9X40", "B00AEFXYOA", "B00AEBB9WI", "B0000YTP1G", "B00AEBB8YW", "B000EMGJ7C", "B000YDBPAM", "B0000VD02Y", "B000023VTP", "B000EHRVOW", "B0009OL7Z4", "B00005JLSK", "B000XJD33O", "B0000542C9", "B00AEBB8NS", "B001ECDVK4", "B00006FMUW", "6304765266", "B004SEUJK0", "B003ASLJK4", "B0000AOV4I", "6305236569", "B002VECM6S", "B002K0WBXW", "B00008G7UF", "B000J103OI", "B0042816YK", "B00081U7HC", "6305213283", "B004SIP9RO", "B003BV8ICC", "B0015I2RT8", "078322740X", "6305212112", "B008R65XWO", "6305657947", "B0017ANAZO", "B0000JBALO", "B00EIBO8T6", "B00AEFYHVO", "B00005JNDZ", "B0099114WO", "B0088X7Z6S", "B007JNR54A", "B00005JPSM", "076784744X", "B002ZG988M", "B00386EZKE", "B000683VI4", "B00AEBB9FA", "B004EPZ070", "B00003CXSM", "B00AEFY99O", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00005JG6N", "0783226772", "B000JYW5B4", "B003Y5H574", "B0038N9X3Q", "B002GHHHGU", "B000CCW2P2", "B00004TJKK", "B0017ANB08", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B000P0J0EW", "B004SIP8LG", "B000A343RI", "079073219X", "B0045HCJJ4", "B000CCBCAS", "B000HEWEE4", "0792833198", "B000765IJK", "B0002I84N0", "B001DDBCUA", "6304907729", "B003Y5H524", "B000ENC5YW", "B0007IO6NM", "B005S9EJ14", "B004FQX5B6", "B000HEWEJO", "B0001I55M4", "B00003CXFV", "B00005JLH0", "B00DDT0JB0", "B002U4UYYQ", "B00DW5ILUG", "B00005JN3W", "B00006ZXSO", "B00007E2F5", "B004SIP9VA", "B00118T632", "B004A8ZWSS"], "bought_together": ["B0038N9WKU", "B000MQC9H4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0038N9WKU", "0767811100", "B000MQC9H4", "B00AEBB9WI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2886}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.79, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0001AVZA8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q5RC1103L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Something's Gotta Give"}
{"description": "In the episodes contained in this volume,Farscape's fourth season finally kicks into gear and does some of the most surprising things a television show has ever done. The first three episodes are allFarscapeclassics, which take our expectations and jump up and down on them. \"Unrealized Realities\" takes John Crichton (Ben Browder) through a wormhole to be interrogated by a creature who regards the Ancients (who put the knowledge of wormhole technology in his brain) as annoying bumblers and who tells him a lot about time and about alternate universes. This gives the cast a chance to play each other again--Claudia Black's performance as Chiana is particularly disorientating. In \"Kansas\" John finds himself finally back on Earth, during his own adolescence, with the task of ensuring that his father does not die in theChallengerexplosion and alter his personal history. The visit to his long-missed home continues in \"Terra Firma,\" when the crew of Moya have to cope with Bush's America and John discovers the hard way--politics, family, old girlfriends, alien assassins--that you cannot go home again. Lastly in the moderately weaker \"Twice Shy,\" Chiana (Gigi Edgeley) and the others learn that no good deed goes unpunished, as a slave they rescue turns out to be one of the more deadly individual menaces they have ever faced.--Roz Kaveney", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001US5TM", "B00029NMJ0", "B00011ZBUM", "B0000V8FBU"], "bought_together": ["B0001US5TM", "B0000V8FBU"]}, "price": 8.29, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 403648}, "asin": "B0001DCXQK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517ZH5805KL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Farscape - Season 4, Collection 3"}

Their tenuous existence  becomes more chaotic when they set out to find the parents of an abandoned baby on  Christmas Eve. They scream insults as they confront the lies they've told  each other--and themselves--about the past. Yet they remain curiously endearing  and even noble.

{"description": "Tony Kushner's prize-winningplayAngels in Americabecame the  defining theatrical event of the 1990s, an astonishing mix of philosophy,  politics, and vibrant gay soap opera that summed up the Reagan era for an  entire generation of theater-goers. Post-9/11 would  seem to be too late for a film version--philosophy and politics don't  always age well--but this 2003 HBO adaptation, ably directed by Mike Nichols  (The Graduate), provides a time capsule of the '80s and reveals the  deep emotional subcurrents that will give the play lasting power.The story centers around Prior Walter  (Justin Kirk) and Louis Ironson (Ben Shenkman), a gay couple that falls  apart when Prior grows ill as a result of AIDS. But cancer is not the only  thing invading Prior's life: He begins to have religious visions of an  angel (Emma Thompson,Sense and Sensibility) announcing that he is  a prophet. Louis, who doesn't cope well with disease and suggestions of  mortality, leaves and starts a relationship with Joe Pitt (Patrick  Wilson), a closeted Mormon who works for Roy Cohn (Al Pacino,Dog Day  Afternoon)--the real-life right-wing lawyer, notorious for his  ruthless behind-the-scenes machinations. Add in Joe's depressed and  hallucinating wife Harper (Mary Louise Parker,Fried Green  Tomatoes), his determined but open-minded mother Hannah (Meryl Streep,Adaptation), a fierce drag queen/nurse named Belize (Jeffrey  Wright,Basquiat, reprising his celebrated performance from the  Broadway production), and you've still only begun to discover the wealth  of characters and storylines in Kushner's ambitious work.The  powerhouse cast (also featuring James Cromwell, Michael Gambon, and Simon  Callow) is uniformly superb. The script has its weaknesses--some of the  fantastic elements, including Prior's journey to Heaven towards the end,  fall flat--but even what doesn't work is bristling with ideas and a  ferocious desire to capture human existence in this time and place.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["1559362316", "B00005AQMJ", "B000067D0Y", "B00A92MGLA", "0800141806", "B00KMULA9I", "B000053VAW", "1559360739", "B003VZNAU8", "B004AR4W4O", "B0000560PU", "B00005B8U4", "B000BZISX0", "B00D2UMHIS", "B006QVRVW2", "B0001HAGRE", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00018D3YQ", "B00996RSYM", "B003IG06PM", "B001CQONPE", "1559360615", "B00AEFY8MM", "B00005AWR9", "B00005JO5L", "B00005MKKV", "B00EU8RB14", "B00005QW5X", "B0000AYJV8", "B0045HCJ94", "B0000TAZB0", "B00EJGMF22", "B00008UALE", "B0030BOCFU", "0802136923", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B008SAPCAM", "B0007ZEOPK", "B001QUF3SW", "B00I4CWIVU", "B005ETAMFK", "B000PAAK5U", "B00005JOFQ", "B00GHP8SH4", "B0009W5IMO", "B00114XLZA", "B00F98FOPE", "B001Y7CVXC", "B007C95S9K", "B00G7QPXUI", "B000A9QK5K", "B00AXGX4DQ", "B0045HCJ8U", "B006QVRVJK", "B00H7LJ2UO", "B002VECLVO", "B00127RAGC", "B00008R9KD", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00005JKIS", "B00005JKJA", "B005S9EIGU", "B004SIP71M", "B000NIVJFY", "B002SSNFUO", "B000228EGS", "B00003L9CK", "B004SUDQ1S", "B007V4QKYI", "1559363606", "B004LB5FCW", "B00005N89S", "B009XJ5ED2", "B0083V2VYG", "B000UPMZ30", "0767821009", "B002IVDLH8", "B00005V5NU", "B00GUO3C3W", "B00C1LIZMQ", "B000GG4Y32", "B009D004TA", "0802122388", "B00007L4MV", "155936078X", "B000WDVNMO", "B000068MBW", "1559363959", "B00004TJH0", "0571169341", "B00000F3FS", "B00FGVS0DM", "B000H5V8H2", "B0006GVJEY", "B0001HAGRY", "B000065V3L", "B0042L0OG8", "B00HUTPKA4", "B000YHQNCI", "B0030BOCMS"], "bought_together": ["1559362316"], "buy_after_viewing": ["1559362316", "B00005AQMJ", "B00AQKU1QC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23141}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 15.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001I2BUI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512MTZBBPML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Angels in America"}

{"description": "No actor works harder to open a movie than Tom Cruise. His enthusiasm is throughout the DVD extras as he mirrors his samurai character by constantly talking about \"loyalty\" and \"discipline\" while working on the film. However as a post-movie experience, the top-line extras with Cruise and director Edward Zwick are repetitive and underwhelming, with too many clips from the film we assume DVD viewers have just seen. The History Channel show is also a pre-release promotional device that misses an opportunity to really dig into this intriguing time period. Better are segments on the costumes, the production design, and how you put together an Imperial army--in New Zealand, no less. Zwick's low-key and dense commentary (plus a \"Video Journal\") is not vital, but he illustrates many of the little peculiarities it took to make the wide-ranging film come together. There are two deleted scenes; a samurai's first appearance is particularly memorable.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFY5B6", "B002O3Z50Q", "B00004XPPG", "B00AMSLDTM", "B0002YLCG0", "B0000DZTIW", "B000AARKOO", "B000QXDED6", "B003U0AHBO", "B00AEFXKUI", "B000A2WP7O", "B008MIMWOY", "B00AEBBA36", "B004AOECXI", "6305692688", "B000MGB6NM", "B0000TANUI", "079283366X", "B00005JL78", "B000W1SZBS", "B004SIP88Y", "B0034G4P58", "B001TUZG4K", "B00AS1Q93S", "B000MRA592", "B00001ZWUS", "B000E5N6LG", "B000XR9L50", "B0001HLVS2", "B00HEPDGKA", "B003ASLJO0", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000P0J0EW", "B0000A2ZNX", "B00005JNTI", "B0018QPPXW", "B000065U1N", "B000095WW8", "B0002WZTOI", "B002VWNIEA", "B004U7MQWY", "B002VWNID6", "B008JFUO36", "B00AEBB86A", "B00005JN0W", "B0007Q6VXC", "B001LRJH0U", "B000MZHW40", "B0002IQMAM", "B00004WG2F", "B003INBO3I", "B000EHRVMY", "B000NOKFHQ", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEFXVCU", "B000YENUI6", "B000M341QE", "B0000YEEGM", "B001680M26", "B008R65XYC", "B002ZG99QS", "B00008K76U", "B000HRMAPE", "B007TBKAXK", "B00000G3PA", "0767810856", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00AEFXYJA", "B002T9H2LA", "B000P0J0AG", "B00003CXZ1", "B000O599YO", "B000FS9FCG", "6304711905", "B00AEFXRRO", "B000HRMAUY", "B001ILHY1I", "B002NZK5V4", "B002VWNICC", "B000VKL6ZM", "B001UDS4BS", "B002ZG997C", "B004SIP8ZM", "0800177967", "B0001O3YD0", "B00005ATZT", "B004XFZ3UU", "B00004Z4WR", "B005LAIH2W", "B0007TKNGA", "B00000JQB5", "B0012Q732O", "B002ZG97RE", "B0002VEUV2", "0800141741", "B002ZG977Y", "B00005N5S3", "B00008G8M4", "B0000B1OFL"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFY5B6", "B00004XPPG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000QXDED6", "B00BEJL6JK", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00JU949TK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 121880}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 17.25, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001JXOUS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EdSWs9r9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Last Samurai (Full Screen Edition)"}

Forced to name an Albanian citizen as their company&#x92;s acting \"chairman,\" Gino and Fiore turn to Spiro&#x96;a prisoner of war for over fifty years, Spiro emerges as the perfect pawn. However, when Spiro suddenly disappears, Gino finds himself on a journey that will ultimately reshape the integrity of his soul.

{"description": "DVD #1 On DVD #1 of the Little Rascals Collection is 1923's Dogs of War, in which the Little Rascals meet the one and only Harold Lloyd after a vegetable-throwing war between rival kid gangs leads the rascals to a nearby movie studio. Not only do the Rascals tear up the studios but that loveable gang tears up the laughs.From the same year comes another silent-era Our Gang comedy- Derby Day, in which the Little Rascals, after watching a real horse race, decide to try it for themselves and stage their own race using tricycles and neighborhood pets.DVD #2 When Our Gang is forced to put on a play at the local school in Stage Fright, mishaps and shenanigans arise when the rascals destroy not only their lines but the stage. From fireworks tied to a cow's tail to feuding lead actors, Stage Fright is one of the funniest Our Gang short films to date.In 1924, the Little Rascals starred in The Sundown Limited. This little gem was one of Our Gang's more elaborate films, in which Mickey and Joe, after causing all sorts of mischief on a real train, build their own railroad, the way only Our Gang can.In The Pirates, Our Gang attempts to set sail on the high seas in a pirate ship built from spare parts. But when the ship sinks on its maiden voyage, the gang accidentally find themselves on a real boat headed for a run-in with a Navy battleship in this comedic gem from 1923.DVD #3 This disc holds some of the funniest Little Rascal shorts ever made. In Mary Queen of Tots, another from the silent-era Our Gang shorts, little, rich girl Mary loses her $4 to the evil governess, and it's up to the gang to help her get it back.In The Fourth Alarm, the kids from Our Gang save the day by putting out a small kitchen fire, but when they decide to start their own Fire Department the pressure turns out to be more than they can handle when a four-alarm fire threatens the town.And from 1930 is School's Out. When Ms. Crabtree's brother comes into town, little Jackie Cooper and the gang, thinking he's come to ask their favorite teacher to get married, try to get rid of him at all costs, in what turns out to be a hilarious turn of events.DVD #4  When the gang decides to become Bear Shooters, they pack their bags and go camping in the one spot that they shouldn't have. But it's not a bear that causes the problems but criminals, when the Little Rascals stumble across their hideout in this comedy gem from 1930.The gang is putting on a show with Alfalfa billed as \"King of the Crooners.\" But Alfalfa abandons the stage, saying his crooning days are over, and that opera is his true calling. But after taking a nap and dreaming of a successful future in popular music, he changes his mind and joins the rest of the gang for the closing number in Our Gang Follies of 1938.In Waldo's Last Stand, the gang decides to help Waldo when his lemonade stand gets into financial trouble. The Little Rascal's approach is to put on a show and sell the lemonade to its customers, but when their only patron is Froggy, who is not only broke but not thirsty, the gang has to come up with idea after idea to make some money.DVD #5 On DVD #5, see the Little Rascals as you've never seen them before- as adults! Twenty-five years after they tore up the silver screen, Our Gang returns to the small screen for a reunion on the 1950's television program 'You Asked For It.' They're all grown up and they're all here: Farina, Little Johnny, Jackie Condon, Fatty, and the rest of the Our Gang players in the Our Gang Reunion.Kid Stuff: Inside Hollywood's Child Stars is an affectionate and revealing look at some of the greatest child stars of the large and small screen. We'll hear about some of the dizzying highs and tragic lows of being a kid in Hollywood from former child stars such as Ron Howard (\"The Andy Griffith Show\"), Roddy McDowall (\"How Green Was My Valley\"), Margaret O'Brien (\"Meet Me In St. Louis\"), Tommy \"Butch\" Bond (\"Our Gang\"), and Johnny Whitaker (\"Family Affair\").", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002OGHGSW", "B005OASMLU", "B006WN5W5M", "B005BYBZKY", "B0073WQBC4", "B00F77MAC2", "B001EXE2Y2", "B00CRVL5WC", "B000V6LSO0", "B00IYRLUEG", "0517583259", "B006363QHE", "B000TGJ8B2", "B0019UGYDC", "B007RMQ56M", "B00J4BW0SQ", "B001CQONOA", "B004G9UXDK", "B00LG7VWIA", "B0000BV1XX", "B00K1EKVD6", "B007AVO1MU", "B00K2CHVSK", "B00LBHOCHS", "B00I03D8ZS", "B00JK47BHM", "B00CA4S024", "B000A5046K", "B0038SUBDC", "B008MCKLAM", "B0050UEVFU", "B00961ENYI", "B002PQ7JQK", "B00K2CHWYI", "B004BR83KC", "B00KSPST6Y", "B0030CIG74", "B00JMXWPU4", "B00F9D00SU", "B00BN3DZZA", "B004IF4EYQ", "B00HZN8TBC", "B00DXLO086", "B004RBC5HE", "B000BT96FA", "B000NA21YA", "B005DDN51A", "B000I8OM94", "B0027CSMY0", "B009DA74BG", "B00005B1WX", "B00062IYXM", "B00K7IPGS6", "B003WVJ65Y", "B005FHWWXQ", "0783219806", "B008MCKL5W", "B0001EQHXO", "B00IF0KAYS", "B00KUS5YGC", "B00K6DEQ92", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B000HWZ4E8", "B00062IYW8", "B00ADRYGSC", "B001BSBBO4", "B008MIYKS0", "B008SKQ17A", "B00FJYXQCG", "B00K6D1S7A", "B001CO42CK", "B00GD7UO4G", "B000FI9OEK", "B0044LYRL4", "B00L4K3MLE", "B002PQ7JR4", "B00JQF7ZTE", "B00BMKGZVA", "B008DCAG9M", "B000784XBW", "B00465I1BA", "B00C7A8WWO", "B0013XZ6SY", "B00IGVJH0E", "B0050UEVJ6", "B0002KE2FW", "B00IYJFB2G", "B00ELKDDWM", "B00062IYYQ", "B005BUA1JY", "B000H5U5EE", "B004Z7FV4O", "B0015XHP3Q", "B00005R1O7", "B000E0ODKY", "B00JDCP0QA", "B007L4HEXE", "B00DXLO0D6", "B00E5G03I4", "B0001NBLYA"], "bought_together": ["B006WN5W5M", "B005OASMLU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005OASMLU", "B004G9UXDK", "B004IF4EYQ", "B004RBC5KQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 143313}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 49.99, "brand": "PBS", "asin": "B0001ZZ4PA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZB0AH96EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Little Rascals Collection"}
{"description": "Some boxed sets claim to be definitive, but are haphazardly selected. Not this one. Four of the five titles here can legitimately lay claim to being essentials in the film noir canon, and the fifth,The Set-Up, is a terrific boxing picture with a strong noir atmosphere. If you're a fan of noir--or have no idea what it's all about--this collection is a treat.Of course, none of these movies were made as \"film noir.\" The term was coined later by French critics to describe the moody, anxious feel of postwar American movies, especially the genre that highlighted duplicitous dames and susceptible men lost in the criminal jungle. Indeed, the titleThe Asphalt Jungleconveys the edgy urban arena of these pictures. That film is John Huston's masterly 1950 account of a heist, with Sterling Hayden the disenchanted, noirish hero. Joseph H. Lewis'sGun Crazy(1949) is one of the most supercharged (and sexually perverse) of noir films, with John Dall and Peggy Cummins as young criminals in love.Murder, My Sweet(1944) is a straight adaptation of Raymond Chandler's novelFarewell, My Lovely. Amid the film's shadowy chiaroscuro, former musical comedy star Dick Powell makes a career-changing transition as Chandler's private dick, Philip Marlowe.Out of the Pastputs Robert Mitchum (perhaps the quintessential noir actor) in trouble with gangster Kirk Douglas, complicated by classic femme fatale Jane Greer. Jacques Tourneur provides the evocative direction. AndThe Set-Upplays out an ingenious boxing tale in \"real time,\" superbly enacted by (former boxer) Robert Ryan.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FI9OCW", "B003G9IT3C", "B0024FAG80", "B000PKG7DE", "B0024FAG8A", "B00097DY20", "B000B8384Q", "B00005RDRL", "B0007TKNKQ", "B002YNQEFG", "B00023P4GA", "B00005AUK9", "B0007ZEO8C", "B0087ZG7OI", "B002YNQEF6", "B000CNE088", "B000BQ5IXW", "B00023P4II", "B0007ZEO7S", "B003B3V0RA", "B00114XLTQ", "B00004XPPK", "B001CC7PM6", "B00007ELDG", "B00114XLUA", "B00004W229", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B000EXDSBQ", "6305999872", "B000087F79", "B000RXVND8", "B000PKG7CU", "B004C2523M", "B000LN6UHI", "B00012L786", "B000EXDSBG", "B002945DUM", "B0024FAG6W", "B0006Z2NS6", "B000B83846", "B000I2JDF8", "B001ASQ9OC", "B000GRUQJW", "B009X919UE", "B00004W19C", "B001QFFBAM", "B00008LDNZ", "B0009X7678", "B000BGH2NG", "B00I3C1T34", "B00D09AXUA", "B00457ZNS8", "B000FMGTQC", "B001CC7PLW", "B001OSC4G0", "B005152C9G", "B00023P4FQ", "B000KJTGFG", "B000YRY7VC", "B00006II5J", "B000B8380A", "B00114XLUU", "B008BSM1CI", "B000FFJYA2", "B00K6D1S7A", "B000A0GOEQ", "B00CVB6XF2", "B00ICWO1LC", "B000M2E3GI", "B00DBE97S8", "B0006HBV3C", "B000FKO3VM", "B0010KHOSA", "B0011FDVEK", "B00AEBBA7W", "B0006Z2NE0", "B0006UEVVS", "B000GIXLUW", "B0010KHOSU", "B0007TKNHY", "B0009X7682", "B000JLTRGI", "B006GVNHMA", "B000CNE08I", "0312180764", "1590201442", "B00AEFXN9G", "B0026ZQJP2", "B00AF4OTM6", "B00097DY0M", "B0000694WH", "0879101970", "B00C3ALM02", "B00EL6A7XE", "B008K1PXIK", "B000UJCAK4", "B00005AUKD", "B005H8G78O", "B00KIZY3XW"], "bought_together": ["B000FI9OCW", "B003G9IT3C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000244EYW", "B0024FAG80", "B000244EX8", "B000244EWO"]}, "price": 34.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15607}, "asin": "B000244F2S", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51LSoFvy1uL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Film Noir Classic Collection, Vol. 1 (The Asphalt Jungle / Gun Crazy / Murder My Sweet / Out of the Past / The Set-Up)"}
{"description": "Say this forHarum Scarum:  At least it has the virtue of boasting one of the strangest settings of any Elvis Presley vehicle. Elvis plays an action-movie star on a goodwill tour of the Middle East who's kidnapped in a remote country that has turned its back on modernity. Vilified as an \"American unbeliever,\" he is enlisted by the Lord of the Assassins in a plot to kill a monarch (they've mistaken his filmic kung fu fighting skills for the real thing). And this is an Elvis picture? The soundtrack has a particularly mad selection of faux-\"Kismet\" numbers relating to the setting, with lyrics such as \"I'm gonna go where the desert sun is/I'm gonna go where I know the fun is.\" Hints that the whole thing is a Rudolph Valentino spoof help the early going, but it gets pretty draggy.

{"description": "In the annals of acting, 2004 will be remembered as a banner year for Jamie Foxx. Before his acclaimed turns inCollateral, alongside Tom Cruise, andRay, the Ray Charles biopic, he produced and starred in this made-for-cable movie about former gangbanger Stan \"Tookie\" Williams. Directed by actor-turned-filmmaker Vondie Curtis Hall (Gridlock'd),Redemptiontracks Tookie's rise as co-founder of L.A.&#x92;s notorious Crips, fall to death-row inmate, and rise again to Nobel Prize Nominee. Tookie&#x92;s reminiscences to journalist Barbara Becnel (Lynn Whitfield), while he is on death row, frame the story. Virtually unrecognizable from his days onIn Living Color, a buffed-up, dreadlocked Foxx gives an effectively low-key performance, while Whitfield also shines in a less rewarding role.Redemptionmay not have the grandeur ofMalcolm XorThe Hurricane--and Tookie's transformation from man of violence to man of peace happens too quickly--but his story is just as inspirational.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "American sitcoms usually have a bland, likable central character who has to cope with obnoxious acquaintances--who usually provide most of the actual comedy. The British smartly put the comic personalities front and center, andKeeping Up Appearanceshas one of the best: The petty, pretentious, tyrannical Hyacinth Bucket (played by the impressive Patricia Routledge), a dowdy middle-class social climber with a piercing voice and an unshakable faith in herself. Upon learning that her mailman has seven children, she declares disapprovingly, \"Quite an achievement when you have to be up so early.\" Whether she's scheming to invite a minor local celebrity to a garden party or scowling at an enormous dog left in her driveway, Hyacinth terrorizes all around her, particularly her long-suffering husband Richard (Clive Swift), who takes a small delight in subverting her efforts from time to time; her trembling neighbors Elizabeth and Emmett (Josephine Tewson and David Griffin), who scarcely leave their house lest they be invited in to coffee; and her sexually frustrated lower-class sisters Daisy and Rose (Judy Cornwell and Mary Millar) and Daisy's layabout husband Onslow (Geoffrey Hughes), who longs to be left in peace to eat chips and watch the races. Though Americans aren't as class-conscious as the Brits, snobbery is universal, and Keeping Up Appearances has developed an appreciative cult following on this side of the Atlantic.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002I9TZHA", "B0002F6BT2", "B0009S2SOY", "B002LFPAUC", "B001JV5BBC", "B0035JHYIY", "B000SINSX0", "B00007JZUC", "B000CDSS22", "B00007JZUF", "B0016RNLZW", "B001B3LIQU", "B008FTWT70", "B002BIULNA", "B00JJRLG7G", "B00AQJANI4", "B000784WKO", "B00007ELCZ", "B001B3LIPG", "B009A68ESA", "B00C2IJJGY", "B00FPPQYXM", "B001T21R6Y", "0563369752", "B002LFPAUM", "B00197YZ7C", "B001TKK3KC", "B009VYAVYG", "B00EF4U7AK", "B00KYCA4QY", "B000ERVK6W", "B00BCXVYOK", "B000A0GOIM", "B005DVIPY4", "B0035JHYJ8", "B0093I4Y3Y", "B000YIGNKY", "B005SH65FO", "B00BVMX9O0", "B00008DP4B", "B00C12ZISE", "B00008L3PB", "B00009XN37", "B004SGWYYM", "B00007JZUE", "B00A0HT99G", "B00JK47BHM", "B00F1BFRA6", "B00GD7UO4G", "B00A27O0N4", "B009DS6YGO", "B00B89X0CW", "0563371072", "B0001JXP8E", "B00AO1RKFS", "B005GP7EVC", "B004HHX9H8", "B004K4FULQ", "B000EMG91S", "B00HUAH14Q", "B0009UZG78", "B004H0ZHD4", "B0007QS28E", "B003PIUIOM", "B0010V4VK8", "B00447G2SY", "B000VDDE18", "B001V7UXG2", "B00HRUQB5O", "B0000ALPJL", "B0009NSCTY", "B008UQUS26", "B008HUSFTS", "B00EH4KOWE", "B0000E6XDU", "B004EYT8BA", "B00004Z4TO", "B00BW4S87A", "B0009S2SQ2", "B0000ALPJN", "B00IXPWGIS", "B000TGJ8B2", "B00CL0MCN0", "B00C7A8WWO", "B008B4LRMC", "B00E5G03I4", "B0028AEO0M", "B000FOQ04Q", "B006JY3OH2", "B000EOTUTE", "B000BITVAG", "B0000ALPJM", "B0000TG8UW", "B004AV5H3U", "B0006Z2L06", "B0090XLDO0", "B004EYT8EC", "B004KVXCB4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00EF4U7AK", "B002I9TZHA", "B002LFPAUC", "B000079DND"]}, "price": 89.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 56496}, "asin": "B0002F6BTC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61NCR0WQXHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Keeping Up Appearances: The Full Bouquet"}
{"description": "You've never seen a sex comedy quite likeThe Decline of the American Empire. That's because there's no sex in this comedy--just a lot of entertaining talk about it (and a few discreet flashbacks). The speakers are eight Montreal academics. For most of the film, the men--R&#xE9;my (R&#xE9;my Girard), Claude (Yves Jacques), Pierre (Pierre Curzi), and Alain (Daniel Bri&#xE8;re)--fix dinner while talking about sex. The women--Dominique (Dominique Michel), Louise (Doroth&#xE9;e Berryman), Diane (Louise Portal), and Danielle (Genevi&#xE8;ve Rioux)--work out while talking about sex. That evening, they all gather for dinner... and talk about sex.The Decline of the American Empiremade the reputation of writer-director Denys Arcand, but his greatest success would arrive 17 years later withThe Barbarian Invasions. In that 2003 Oscar-winner, Arcand revisits the lovably loquacious characters from the first film, all of whom are older, wiser--and just as obsessed with sex.--Kathleen C.

Larry Starczek (Tom Selleck), the detective on the case, also happens to be involved with prosecuting attorney Muriel Wynn (Monica Potter). Seven years later, he's still single, she's married, and her old colleague, attorney Arthur Raven (William H. Macy), is assigned to Gandolph's final appeal. Former judge Gillian Sullivan (Felicity Huffman), who presided over Gandolph's trial (and has since done time for bribery) becomes his unlikely ally.

{"description": "It feels both inaccurate and inadequate to describeThe Officeas a comedy. On a superficial level, it disdains all the conventions of television sitcoms: there are no punch lines, no jokes, no laugh tracks, and no cute happy endings. More profoundly, it's not what we're used to thinking of as funny. Most of the fervently devoted fan base watched with a discomfortingly thrilling combination of identification and mortification. The paradox is that its best moments are almost physically unwatchable. Set in the offices of a fictional British paper merchant,The Officeis filmed in the style of a reality television show. The writing is subtle and deft, the acting wonderful, and the characters beautifully drawn: the cadaverous team leader Gareth (Mackenzie Crook); the monstrous sales rep, Chris Finch (Ralph Ineson); and the decent but long-suffering everyman Tim (Martin Freeman), whose ambition and imagination have been crushed out of him by the banality of ! the life he dreams uselessly of escaping. The show is stolen, as it was intended to be, by insufferable office manager David Brent, played by codirector-cowriter Ricky Gervais. Brent will become a name as emblematic for a particular kind of British grotesque asBasil Fawlty, but he is a deeper character. Fawlty is an exaggeration of reality, and therefore a safely comic figure. Brent is as appalling as only reality can be.--Andrew MuellerThe second series exceeded even the sky-high standards of the first. Indeed, it ventured beyond caricature and satire, touching on the very edge of darkness.  Ricky Gervais is once again excruciatingly superb as David Brent, but in this series, Brent's to-the-camera assertions concerning his management qualities and executive capabilities are seriously challenged when the Slough and Swindon branches are merged and his former Swindon equivalent Neil (Patrick Baladi) takes over as area manager. To compensate, Brent cultivates his pathologically mistaken image of himself as an entertainer-motivator-comedian whose stage happens to be the workplace. Meanwhile, Tim, who can only maintain his sanity by teasing the priggish Gareth, continues to wrestle with his yearning for receptionist Dawn Tinsley (Lucy Davis), a sympathetic character persisting in a relationship with a man about whom she still maintains unspoken reservations. As ever, it's the awkward, reality TV-style pauses and silences, the furtive, meaningful and unmet glances across the emotional gulf of the open-plan office, that say it all here. As for Brent, his own breakdown is prefaced by a moment of hideous hilarity--an impromptu office dance, a mixture of \"Flashdanceand MC Hammer\" as Brent describes it, but in reality bad beyond description. Then, when his fate is sealed, he at last reveals himself in a memorable finale to perhaps the greatest British sitcom, besidesFawlty Towers, ever made.--David StubbsThe brilliant and devastating comedy ofThe Officeis brought to a satisfying conclusion inThe Office Special, originally a two-part Christmas special on the BBC, set three years after the end of the faux-documentary's second season.

{"description": "LikeGattacadid before it,Code 46extrapolates from the present to posit a chilling, dystopian look at our genetically regimented future. In the corporate-controlled, near-future scenario presented by prolific director Michael Winterbottom and his regular screenwriter Frank Cottrell Boyce, nations and languages have merged to form a polyglot society in which genetic imperfections are avoided by the strict enforcement of Code 46, which prohibits sex between people who share 100%, 50%, or even 25% matching DNA. As an insurance-fraud investigator in Shanghai to investigate the issuance of forged passports (a major offense in an overcrowded world), Tim Robbins meets his prime suspect (Samantha Morton, echoing her role inMinority Report), and their violation of Code 46 has tragic and ultimately dehumanizing repercussions. Fascinating as a \"what-if\" scenario, Winterbottom's film is more successful as a melancholy mood-piece than a science-fiction tale. While the plot and characters suffer from occasionally vague definition,Code 46offers a fascinating study of human longing in an age of oppressive globalization.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00K0MM4AM", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B004SUDQ72", "B0018O4YT0", "B0002CHIKG", "0783225903", "0767805712", "B000I8OOG0", "B00000K3TS", "B000HOL67U", "B0001Z37IG", "078401213X", "B000056N2Z", "B003TRMLM6", "B00000JSJC", "B000JMK6LW", "B000C20VVE", "B009POCG0Y", "B00JAQJNN0", "0767821629", "B00J4LMJ3W", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B004EQAVHI", "B008B9JTDQ", "B0000AOX0F", "B000UYX4Q8", "B0013LL2Z2", "B000ADWDFC", "B00000F4MA", "B000BGH29K", "B00003CXZ4", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B003U6SJY0", "B004EQAVFU", "B00005UQ9T", "B0045HCJ8K", "B00009ATIX", "B003XURDAY", "B001FOPOD8", "0780021541", "B00005JL6M", "B008220DGE", "B00005JL78", "B000087F6L", "B000QXDCJ2", "B0036TGSR6", "B00005R87B", "B009ERK35W", "B00H3JHGBC", "B00005QCVN", "B00CHMBQRA", "155890834X", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B007REV4LQ", "B002FUI4CE", "B003O7I6SE", "B004U7MQWY", "B000A2T2VG", "B00B2BYXSG", "B000O7667K", "B00067BBMS", "B003TRMLQM", "B00018D3V4", "B004FQX59S", "B0069UP2PI", "B00C7A8WZQ", "B00003CXGA", "B00005JKJA", "B000NJL4QC", "B004WCTLNY", "6305428115", "B000HEWEJ4", "B00BC75H5S", "B000CNESU8", "B005LAII3A", "B004LWZW7E", "B001LMAK88", "0767821408", "B00004TA8X", "B002CA68GQ"], "bought_together": ["0783225903"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0018O4YT0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 171201}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.99, "brand": "TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX HOME ENT", "asin": "B00067BBMI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510M83ND4ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Code 46"}
{"description": "The remarkable first season ofDeadwoodrepresents one of those periodic, wholesale reinventions of the Western that is as different from, say,Lonesome Doveas that miniseries is from Howard Hawks'sRio Bravoor the latter is from Anthony Mann'sThe Naked Spur. In many ways, HBO'sDeadwoodembraces the Western's unambiguous morality during the cinema's silent era through the 1930s while also blazing trails through a post-NYPD Blue, post-The West Wingtelevision age exalting dense and customized dialogue. On top of that,Deadwoodhas managed an original look and texture for a familiar genre: gritty, chaotic, and surging with both dark and hopeful energy. Yet the show's creator, erstwhileNYPD Bluehead writer David Milch, never ridicules or condescends to his more grasping, futile characters or overstates the virtues of his heroic ones.Set in an ungoverned stretch of South Dakota soon after the 1876 Custer massacre,Deadwoodconcerns a lawless, evolving town attracting fortune-seekers, drifters, tyrants, and burned-out adventurers searching for a card game and a place to die. Others, particularly women trapped in prostitution, sundry do-gooders, and hangers-on have nowhere else to go. Into this pool of aspiration and nightmare arrive former Montana lawman Seth Bullock (Timothy Olyphant) and his friend Sol Starr (John Hawkes), determined to open a lucrative hardware business. Over time, their paths cross with a weary but still formidable Wild Bill Hickok (Keith Carradine) and his doting companion, the coarse angel Calamity Jane (Robin Weigert); an aristocratic, drug-addicted widow (Molly Parker) trying to salvage a gold mining claim; and a despondent hooker (Paula Malcomson) who cares, briefly, for an orphaned girl. Casting a giant shadow over all is a blood-soaked king, Gem Saloon owner Al Swearengen (Ian McShane), possibly the best, most complex, and mesmerizing villain seen on TV in years.  Over 12 episodes, each of these characters, and many others, will forge alliances and feuds, cope with disasters (such as smallpox), and move--almost invisibly but inexorably--toward some semblance of order and common cause. Making it all worthwhile is Milch's masterful dialogue--often profane, sometimes courtly and civilized, never perfunctory--and the brilliant acting of the aforementioned performers plus Brad Dourif, Leon Rippy, Powers Boothe, and Kim Dickens.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EULSR0", "B000NVI2GU", "B0038M2APA", "B0075FF5QM", "B007A2Z3Y4", "B00B5J6A7W", "B004HW7JNS", "B00CG4XKNM", "B004BZ5AHI", "B00EAPC860", "B00HUCF420", "B00A2JOQMW", "B003Y5HWJU", "B008PJZDXW", "B0028RXXE8", "B00076YPUI", "B00HT850YW", "B00CDTSFF8", "B00J5LXT44", "B00BFAIH68", "B00G4RDQK4", "B002UJIY7A", "1596912391", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B00316DDUO", "B00C8CQRQ4", "B00ECGHM5O", "B000K2V7E6", "B0090XO59U", "B00EIXWW2O", "B005LAJ1H2", "B00HW3EXCE", "B00EEDNR9A", "B0012RLX88", "B00EUI4XHE", "B004QRUN96", "B00J5G1P2W", "B00003CXOP", "B00AATGDUC", "B00IARA8KM", "B009LDD54K", "B000PGTPH8", "B008CLI4N4", "B008V9HKF0", "B00ATP24V4", "6305504024", "B002N57KGM", "B005HAAZLC", "B00G0B7PTW", "B001TH8ZH8", "B000059H7K", "080328702X", "B001FA1OTU", "B0051GOB2G", "B00BVMXBDO", "B0060MYKYY", "B00911L7VA", "B00BQ42Q38", "B00GWJIDFW", "B001DJLCRC", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B0002ERXC2", "B000VWX6T4", "B008BLCP0S", "B00FEP9MYG", "B00GAHJO8G", "B00793J278", "B0002J4X2K", "B00005JL3K", "B00J4LMHMK", "B000YABIQ6", "6304711905", "B0058YPG1G", "B001FB4W0W", "B003PIUBZS", "B00DJYJRHG", "B004HW7JO2", "B001RTSPVY", "B00HEPE6MM", "B00CL151G4", "B00005NOHO", "B0024FAR5M", "B00AYNG9BC", "B0032UYFA6", "B009ERK2UI", "B000BO7DWI", "B000F1IQI2", "B00915G6WQ", "B0081QF6Q8", "B00B5J5YJM", "B00IWTVDUW", "B006MK4QKW", "B00ECHBSP8", "B009LDD1H6", "B0012CJQYQ", "B00BGI076M", "B001GCUER0", "B002FLOTPE", "B005FISBTO", "B0032JTV6A"], "bought_together": ["B000EULSR0", "B000NVI2GU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001FA1OTU", "B000EULSR0", "B0038M2APA", "B000NVI2GU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6874}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 34.99, "brand": "Warner Bros", "asin": "B0006FO5LO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61KQUt8dAdL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Deadwood: Season 1"}

{"description": "Originally broadcast asLegend of Earthseain December 2004, the Sci-Fi Channel's four-hour miniseries ofEarthsearides the coattails of theLord of the Ringstrilogy with its quest-driven story of humble blacksmith Ged (Shawn Ashmore), a wizard-to-be who is mentored by the magical Ogion (Danny Glover) as he seeks to preserve the realm of Earthsea from the evil King Tygath (Sebastian Roch&#xE9;). Ged's adventures lead him to the priestess Tenar (Kristen Kreuk, fromSmallville) and with secrets shared by High Priestess Thar (Isabella Rossellini), they gain the power to prevail over Tygath. As presented by Robert Halmi Sr. (producer ofMerlin,Gulliver's Travelsand several other fantasy miniseries), this skeletal rendering ofEarthseaboasts a wealth of digital effects and semi-lavish set design, but Ashmore's lack of charisma hampers a production already fraught with problems. It provoked the wrath of fantasy fans and a firm rejection by author Ursula K. Le Guin, who had watched helplessly (she wasn't involved or consulted) as her classic novelsA Wizard of EarthseaandThe Tombs of Atuanwere racially \"whitewashed\" (in Le Guin's words) nearly beyond recognition. As TV fantasy goes,Earthseais admirably ambitious, but best enjoyed by those with no awareness of the classic books it isveryloosely based on.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007OCG5Q", "B0039PGH9G", "B0000640T0", "B000AQOHMG", "B00B04NIZO", "B003RHZ6IE", "B0002Y4TWE", "B00260HH30", "B000MGUZCU", "B004CRR9EW", "B003Z8ZC1G", "B006JN87WK", "B0013D8L72", "B002XJDUV2", "B004WO9OUC", "B002436WFI", "B0010X744G", "B002C6VMJI", "B003BI7718", "B003C5FMNK", "B001RXDM1I", "B0010X741Y", "B0031DDG9A", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B00EQ2KVQQ", "B000E1YW2M", "B0040GMPEE", "B00AEFXT7W", "B000A6T1ZE", "B00KO7NUWO", "B00HZMZ2HM", "B0000639EV", "B001K2KM8C", "B00008RUYH", "B0000WN0SW", "B0031DDG90", "B00ATK02IG", "1574925628", "B003G715Q2", "B00BUWD7WA", "B000FJH5M2", "B006VJ1AAI", "B003JSSPSY", "B000E5N6B6", "1442459913", "B003EYVXXW", "B002GY9F9K", "B000MMMTD2", "B0056G1APW", "B00ECXJC28", "B001RXDM2M", "B00CFA222M", "B002U0KHME", "B007TBJUW2", "B005TZFZ6U", "B00HW3LAF2", "B004LROMS4", "B005TG8156", "B000056WR3", "B009DE6HW4", "B000XUUQRE", "B00IARA89S", "B005TK0MFE", "141650964X", "B001MVYUQG", "B00GM473M6", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B003PGNBO8", "B007SO31BG", "B001F0TM44", "B00DTRR43W", "B000NA28I4", "B000BCCAEQ", "B0009JE6G6", "B000ELL1QC", "B004P2VQZC", "B0057FGD2C", "B00GTZWZH6", "0547722044", "B007RMQ4MM", "B004XM38CS", "B0006FO9B0", "0689845367", "B00DBPBQ6I", "B00HGJAQ4I", "B0011FLGZQ", "B00HI9QDQ6", "B00J11U54K", "B0002J58GU", "B008JFUPPI", "B005LAIH54", "B000FIHN8O", "B003R0MEYA", "B001DW2BG0", "B00005JM39", "B008JFUNHI", "B000TXNDT8", "B000WMFZK6", "B001MEJY9G", "B00005U8QM"], "bought_together": ["B0007OCG5Q", "B00B04NIZO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00B04NIZO", "B0039PGH9G", "B003RHZ6IE", "0547773749"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 29267}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "Lions Gate Entertainment", "asin": "B00077BPA0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EXX59WJ7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Earthsea"}

{"description": "The highly acclaimed, award-winning Turkish filmDistantis a deeply compassionate and frequently amusing study of quiet desperation, prompting many critics to favorably compare writer-director Nuri Bilge Ceylan's subtly hypnotic drama to the films of Ozu and Tarkovsky. Watch closely and you'll recognize someone you know, or even yourself, and the quietest moments are the most enjoyably revealing. Muzaffer &#xD6;zdemir and Mehmet Emin Toprak shared Best Actor honors at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival for their perfectly nuanced performances as (respectively) divorced, 40-something photographer Mahmut and his distant relative Yusef, who arrives in Istanbul looking for work, and quickly wears out his welcome. Tensions mount, revealing solitude as the natural (if not preferred) state of these lonely, melancholy men. (In the context of this film, it's tragically ironic that Toprak was killed in an auto accident, at age 28, six months before his honors at Cannes.) With understated humor, Ceylan observes Mahmut and Yusef's chronic isolation, but he never passes judgment.Distantcould've been made anywhere and it would yield the same visually seductive study of detachment.

With plenty of sharply fanged villains, bosomy victims and an eerie castle just minutes from the closest freeway exit, this bone-chilling horror story is one you can really sink your teeth into.Two lovers, Paul and Erica make a grave mistake.

It tells the story of this young woman's relentless, moving and sometimes comic search for her fiancC)e, who has disappeared. He is one of five French soldiers believed to have been court-martialed under mysterious circumstances and pushed out of an allied trench into an almost-certain death in no-man's land.

{"description": "Joan Crawford bashes her way through this melodrama inspired by the Bugsy Siegel-Virginia Hill story. Our girl walks out of tacky poverty at the beginning and re-shapes herself into a fur-lined mobster's moll, her will of steel out-pointing the men at every stop. David Brian (recently herFlamingo Roadco-star) is the looming blond monster who runs the organization, Steve Cochran is the Bugsy guy building his own network in Nevada, and Kent Smith is the meek accountant Joan bullies into becoming a syndicate player. It's all from that mid-career post-Mildred Pierceperiod that served Crawford so well, with the full-on film noir look (Ted McCord photographed) and the strong whiff of American sleaze.Joan Crawford's face had assumed its masklike quality at this point, and at times she seems more of a business manager than an actress:  organizing each scene, pushing the story along to its next stop. In its own over-the-top way, it works:  there isn't a moment when she doesn't seem capable of devouring anybody that stands in her way. Everything is writ large in this movie, which makes it a fitting target for a Carol Burnett send-up... and which also makes it a great deal of fun.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0008ENICA", "B0008ENI98", "B0010KHOSK", "B0008ENIAC", "B006X0ZN3K", "B00000IPHP", "B00AG6NO7O", "B0007PALUM", "B00DSAUKKY", "B00AEBBA7W", "B00C3ALM02", "B000EXDSBG", "B000RXVND8", "B000EXDSBQ", "B0012OX7DA", "B0087ZG7OI", "B0008ENIDE", "B00KIZYDCI", "B0008ENIDO", "B00027JYLM", "B00C3ALKWM", "B00005RDRP", "B00023P4GA", "B00I9BU3M2", "B002EAYE9W", "B00EKGX2P0", "B009X919UE", "B001CQONHW", "B00I9BU60Q", "B00276T2KO", "B004LB5FEA", "B001D5DQHK", "B000055XM8", "B00023P4G0", "B00004RER5", "B00FPUN21O", "B008BSM1CI", "B00004XPPK", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B0010KHOSA", "B004RA5AU4", "B0089LT7ZG", "B002ID094Y", "B002YNQEFG", "B002YNQEF6", "B001CC7PM6", "B00466JALY", "B00AEFXRWO", "B00266UX6W", "B000068TPG", "B00KIZY2QA", "B005152C9G", "B0007ZEO8C", "B00EL6A7XE", "B004H83IFU", "B001D8W7EK", "B00CVB6XF2", "B0082LUEFA", "B000JF5T5W", "B006TXDNEW", "B0041URXZK", "B0024FAG80", "B000XNZ7NO", "B0000549B1", "B00I04SVV8", "6305999872", "B00J2PQYG8", "B001QFFBAM", "B0009OL8IK", "B00EL6A9CI", "B000EU1Q2C", "B000E8JO32", "B000E6ESWG", "B0000AZKO7", "B000KGGJ1I", "B000B8384Q", "B00AB2NX1K", "B0008ENICU", "B0026ZQJP2", "B0026RCJHM", "B00004W19C", "B000LN6UHI", "B00DZP1C9K", "B000EU1Q22", "B003B3V0X4", "B00074DY0W", "B000KJTGFG", "B0026ZQJT8", "B0009S4IKQ", "B000244EZ6", "B000B83846", "B0047BXR1C", "B000N3T0H8", "B00AB2NX4M", "B0006UEVVI", "B0012KSUV8", "B002TOL4B4", "B000PKG6OE", "B001CC7PLW", "B000KHI2FS"], "bought_together": ["B0008ENICA", "B0008ENI98"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0008ENID4", "0877973067", "B0008ENIAC", "B0008ENI98"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 31248}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.91, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0008ENI84", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512HMdtuA4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Damned Don't Cry"}

{"description": "Off the Mapavoids conventional drama (hardly any event leads to an outcome you could expect) but the lean, sharp dialogue and superb performances make this movie a rich, human comedy. A young girl named Bo, living in the New Mexico desert, rebels against her bohemian parents by reading Forbes magazine and applying for credit cards.  Her father Charley (Sam Elliott,Tombstone) has sunk deep into a paralyzing depression; her resilient, industrious mother Arlene (Joan Allen,The Upside of Anger) alternates between gently supporting Charley and railing against his zombie-like state. Into this off-balance family comes a tax auditor (Jim True-Frost,Singles), who--after being stung by a bee and lapsing into a sudden fever--becomes an accidental catalyst for change.  In her movie debut as Bo, Valentina de Angelis gives a wonderful performance, head and shoulders above most actors her age. Campbell Scott's direction, as with his first filmBig Night, is warm but not sappy; he has a gift for letting a story wander without it ever getting lost.

{"description": "The question facing any viewer of the Japanese CG featureFinal Fantasy VII: Advent Childrenis: do you have to know the games on which it&#x92;s based in order to understand the film? And the answer is: it certainly helps. But even complete novices (i.e., most parents) in theFinal Fantasyworld will find some entertainment in its wealth of fantasy-based action, and the animation never fails to astonish. Picking up two years after an epic battle between the forces of good (represented by brooding soldier Cloud) and evil (Cloud&#x92;s former general, Sephiroth),FFVIIopens in the devastated city of Midgard, whose youthful occupants suffer from a ghastly disease known as Geostigma. A trio of brothers arrives with what appears to be a cure for the plague, but their gesture conceals a more sinister purpose: to revive Sephiroth and bring about the end of the world. Cloud and his companions must once again rise to the occasion to stop the siblings and the revived Sephiroth from unleashing total destruction. Complex and self-referential to the point of occasional incomprehension,Final Fantasy VIIwill definitely be most appreciated by fans of the game series, but if others can look past the numbing dialogue and frenetic action (which is a bit too intense for very young children), the film offers a carefree and action-packed viewing experience. The two-disc set contains the original Japanese language version of the film as well as an English-dubbed edition (Rachel Leigh Cook and Christy Carlson Romano, among others, provide the vocal talent) and a version edited for the Venice Film Festival. A 30-minute featurette that recaps theFinal Fantasystory up toVII, as well as a making-of documentary, deleted scenes, and promotions for futureFinal Fantasy VIIgames and products round out the extras.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CY5D", "B000FDOTIQ", "B0007OY31G", "B00000JRSB", "B0014X7SQ6", "B008H6GHL0", "B001I9XOQO", "B0010358CQ", "B000QXDFQM", "B00005V1XW", "B00005TNI6", "B001TD6SN0", "B000XYBIKO", "B009AVC922", "B000LOAQNQ", "B001JTADR6", "074401543X", "1566867142", "B0000296O5", "B00ENNBZ68", "B00008URUA", "B001CMIUYS", "B002I0GXWO", "B008H6GH8I", "0744010241", "B00005LOXE", "0804162867", "B003IFVKM6", "6304493681", "B000KF0P1Y", "B000FQ2DTA", "B00002R28C", "B000FS2VZO", "B00008RUYZ", "B004JPJHMY", "B002U6CJO2", "B0009A4EVM", "B000AO8CH4", "B0012Z5UM0", "B0047WMHGC", "B0001O3YA8", "B00003CXBK", "B005H0OEJ6", "B000GABOTU", "B004DMIISM", "162692032X", "B00005NG6U", "B00AO075UY", "B000Y53HH4", "B005NQ5LLE", "B00EZ227X2", "B001GXI4LM", "B002I0GZ5Y", "B004L6Y0T6", "B001G3B0HC", "B00005V4XG", "B00KN16YHO", "B001OQCVI8", "0767802454", "B002MIK0TE", "B000R37S00", "B00BY0G0YU", "B00009WAUH", "0307468372", "B005I65NBW", "B00GHJX8W0", "B008SBZD5U", "B000F6ZIFQ", "0316401196", "B001C4ZQEI", "B000CDGVOO", "B002FVPFUC", "B00004TC6E", "B004COLCK2", "B00005JNJV", "B000NDRNMM", "B00GOT13BQ", "B00004Y57G", "B0045U4U52", "B001TD6SK8", "B0002A2S26", "B002S4DOA4", "B0036BDQ88", "B0013FID78", "B007NU542O", "B000NPTOTK", "B0071LEH14", "1421500493", "B0010YOQIW", "B002O3Z50Q", "B003F3NEAC", "B00829H3E2", "B000BKSJ52", "B00356GVRW", "0744000416", "B000CDGVOE"], "bought_together": ["B00003CY5D", "B0007OY31G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00C3MKCF6", "B0029XFQF0", "B004LWZW4M", "B004DMIIVO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 25738}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.64, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000AMJG4Y", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J3SJW6H0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Final Fantasy VII - Advent Children (Two-Disc Special Edition)"}

{"description": "Reba: Season 2stays the course set in the first season, with sitcom star (and country music legend) Reba McEntire playing a divorced mom (named Reba Hart) trying to get her bearings after her dentist husband, Brock (Christopher Hart), leaves her to take up with his simple but sweet-natured hygenist, Barbra Jean (Melissa Peterman). That's still only part of the heroine's troubles. Her 17-year-old daughter, Cheyenne (Joanna Garcia), and the latter's teenage husband, Van (Steve Howey), are living in Reba's house with their infant, while Reba's younger daughter Kyra (Scarlett Pomers) is maturing at an unnerving clip and son Jake (Mitch Holleman) frequently loses out when it comes to mom's attention. None of that is as crazy-making, however, as Barbra Jean's naive overtures to Reba for sisterly friendship--when the new Mrs. Hart and Brock move into a house near Reba's, Barbra Jean can't wait to visit Brock's ex-wife often. Very often.With these new and reconfigured relationships fixed in place, the dust is settling in season 2. Now comes the really hard part: pinching pennies while trying to teach the profligate, clueless Cheyenne and Van that they don't have the scratch to get an apartment or spend money on non-essentials. Or interviewing for jobs for which Reba clearly has no experience. Or trying to hold onto Kyra's loyalty when what the girl wants is more of dad. The seriousness of these running issues speaks for itself, forming a strong foundation for a show whose humor is understandably biting without being off-putting. McEntire and the rest of the cast are consistently strong and funny, while Peterman continues to stand out in her somewhat broader performance. (Peterman's comic assuredness sometimes reminds one of Lucille Ball.) Lots of life lessons in this show, but a lot of disciplined if gentle comedy as well.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000E6ESBW", "B000640WGM", "B000HT3PEM", "B001FSKE84", "B0024F08TW", "B000QFCDAO", "B00GLT2SOA", "B00CDXG4UC", "B00LBHOCHS", "B008L0YMWS", "B001TKJDNA", "B005MQ58OU", "B0001ZMWXW", "B000M343AI", "B004B93RHY", "B003R4ZMSQ", "B000KGGIL4", "B000GRUMQY", "B00HW3L9MG", "B00IYJHAUC", "B000BNTM46", "B0006Q93BA", "B005DCJ0Q0", "B0007R4SWC", "B000I2J6VE", "B00B04NII6", "B000AJJNJK", "B005BUA1GC", "B003SNJY1C", "B008L0YN6I", "B00BUWD7E8", "B006MFQ4DE", "B00I099K4U", "B0007KTBJO", "B000TGJ82G", "B0002W4SX6", "B00ARWX2SI", "B00I458456", "B004D2GMVM", "B000NA1W3Q", "B00CJ7Y1CK", "B0006N2F0E", "B004MWLXTY", "B005D0OHA6", "B000EBGFQI", "B000A7PKGW", "B00CPEI0A6", "B00JDCP0QA", "B0044LYRFA", "B000UX6TKM", "B000E1MXVO", "B00008972G", "B00GOC75YW", "B000Y7U9AK", "B002AMVEEM", "B0007US79Y", "B000LV6VZ6", "B007S9XXAA", "B000UAE7QI", "B000IJ79VG", "B000291Q3Y", "B0000AKY3Q", "B003XJABZO", "B0018RKEQY", "B000U1ZV4E", "B000MGBSHQ", "B0001906X6", "B007C8RZJW", "B001DZOCVO", "B000VDDE0E", "B000MGBLEQ", "B000AJJNIQ", "B008L0YMUK", "B001BN4WHW", "B002VJ05E4", "B009LDD4V4", "B003FSTN8E", "B000A7DW7Q", "B0009I7NH6", "B00B04NJ1M", "B000SO7PCO", "B005M5OSBU", "B000KGH00W", "B001JAHSO6", "B000EXDRZI", "B000JCEU46", "B002YBUX0K", "B000LW7REE", "B005HIU9HE", "B0009UC80Q", "B0007OCG74", "B002VKB0LU", "B0041U7RF6", "B001JAHSOG", "B00F4CIPRE", "B0002W4SWW", "B000FQIRWC", "B000LV6O12", "055338094X"], "bought_together": ["B000640WGM", "B000E6ESBW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000640WGM", "B0027CSMYA", "B000HT3PEM", "B001FSKE84"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 28253}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 17.59, "brand": "MCENTIRE,REBA", "asin": "B000B8384G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511AM9HHCXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Reba - Season 2"}

{"description": "Filmed like an art-house project,I Love Your Workoffers thoughtful insight to fame from both the celebrity's and the fan's points of view. When you're a celebrity, every fan is a potential stalker. Or at least that's how movie star Gray Evans (Giovanni Ribisi) sees it.  An A-list actor married to a sex symbol, Gray wants to see things clearly in black and white. But his world is a cloudy haze of gray.  Are his flashbacks of a comely girlfriend (Christina Ricci) hallucinations or memories of a simpler, happier time? Are his encounters with a stoic fan (Jason Lee) the prelude to his demise, or the manifestation of his paranoia? Director Adam Goldberg doesn't make this clear, but that's also clearly his intent. The drama offers a charismatic performance by Franka Potente (Run Lola Run,The Bourne Identity) as Gray's frustrated wife. But Ribisi--at his twitchiest--is an unconvincing movie star, appearing more like a run-down wannabe than a full-fledged insider.I Love Your Work?

{"description": "The second season ofLeave It to Beaverfinds the Cleaver family happy and wholesome as ever, with most episodes involving the Beaver getting into a scrape, or hearing the from-the-mountaintop advice from Mom or Dad afterwards. Despite the formula, the episodes hold up well, because of the earnestness of the actors and the delivery of their lines, which is, well, swell. Mom June (Barbara Billingsley) is the matriarch who makes it all look easy in her well-pressed frocks and pearls (pay close attention to those necklaces--there are actually several; some plain strands and some with pendants), and Dad Ward (Hugh Beaumont) is thoughtful and a little monolithic. But it's the adventures of boys, older brother Wally (Tony Dow) and the Beav (Jerry Mathers), that make the show so fun. One episode involves Beav and pal Larry (Rusty Stevens) playing hooky (they're late to school anyway, and they figure they may as well get \"killed\" later as opposed to today), and then winding up on live TV, on a show which June just happens to be watching. Moral? Golly gee, there's more than one, and they're delivered by both parentsandBeav's teacher--and echoed earnestly by Beaver himself. The  chuckles come in a ready stream, even if sometimes inadvertently. Sample exchange: Wally: \"Mom, can I get tattooed?\" June: \"Tattooed!? Absolutely not!\" Wally: \"Oh, OK. Bye.\" No wonder people are so nostalgic for the '50s--teenagers never gave anyone any lip. This season, 1957-58, contains 39 remastered episodes on three double-sided discs, and is a treasure box of nostalgia, in the absolute best sense.--A.T.

{"description": "Michael Winterbottom is no stranger to literary adaptation. BothJudeandThe Claimwere drawn from works by Thomas Hardy. Nor is the versatile filmmaker a stranger to the post-modern romp, like24 Hour Party People. In that paean to Manchester&#x92;s music scene, Steve Coogan was Factory honcho Tony Wilson. In Winterbottom's take on Laurence Sterne's digressiveThe Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman, the prolific helmer combines literature with lunacy and brings Coogan back as the titular character--and then some. Coogan doesn&#x92;t just portray the 18th century squire, but his father Walter and insecure actor \"Steve Coogan.\" It's a film about the making of a film, effortlessly shifting between Tristram&#x92;s tumultuous birth and his frustrated adulthood--bogged down in the writing of his life story--and between fiction and (what appears to be) fact. There are no end to the worries on and off the set: Coogan worries his heels aren't high enough, Rob Brydon worries his teeth are too yellow, and Coogan's girlfriend (Kelly Macdonald) worries she isn't seeing enough of him. It may sound like Spike Jonze&#x92;sAdaptation, but in spirit, it more closely resembles Tony Richardson&#x92;sTom Jones. Coogan and his co-stars, particularly Naomie Harris as the ultimate film nut, Gillian Anderson as the American brought in to boost the project's profile, and Brydon as Tristram&#x92;s Uncle Toby are as game for the challenge as their fearless leader. Consequently,Tristram Shandyisn&#x92;t just one of Winterbottom&#x92;s best films--it's one of theyear&#x92;s best.--Kathleen C.

She impulsively travels to Jindabyne, a snowy ski resort town, because she once met a man from there who said she should call him if she was ever in town. When that connection doesn't materialize, Heidi is forced to fend for herself with little money. Her first night in town, she goes to a bar, drinks, meets a boy, and goes home with him. She doesn't even notice Joe (Sam Worthington) watching her. The next morning, Heidi is dismayed to find that the guy she slept with has a girlfriend, and is on his way back to Sydney. Desperate and broke, she goes looking for work. Despite her good looks and charm, she's a bit too aggressive in trying to win friends and influence people. That night, she hooks up with Joe, and senses a connection between them. Instead of taking her home, he takes her to a motel. He seems reluctant to get involved with her, but she is persistent. The next morning, he hurriedly leaves for work. Joe works for his father, a wealthy farmer.

{"description": "The fourth season may fall a little short of the three that preceded it, butThe Dead Zoneremains one of the smartest, most intriguing series on television. As its adherents well know by now, the show, based on Stephen King's 1979 novel of the same name, was adapted for TV by Michael and Shawn Piller, with actor Anthony Michael Hall (who's also one of the producers) starring as Johnny Smith, who recovered from a horrific car accident and resulting six-year coma to find that his fiancee (Nicole deBoer) is now married to the town sheriff (Chris Bruno), who's helping raise her and Johnny's son. What's more, Johnny is now possessed of some remarkable and unsettling powers: simply by touching another person, or objects touched by others, Smith experiences visions that illuminate events that have happened, will happen, or are simultaneously taking place elsewhere. It must be handy to know which elevator button to push when you're looking for someone who's in trouble, or to realize that it's okay to jump off a hundred-foot bridge because you've seen yourself surviving the fall, but Smith's visions are rarely comforting and not always reliable, leading to moments of genuine suspense and intrigue.With eleven episodes (plus a \"bonus episode\" from December, 2005) spread out over three discs,The Dead Zoneis at its best when dealing with the series' one ongoing storyline: i.e., the machinations of Congressman Greg Stillson (Sean Patrick Flanery), the dumb, arrogant puppet of sinister forces who aim to put him in the White House, where, by accident or design, he may preside over Armageddon, according to Smith's visions. Unfortunately, only three Season Four episodes address that story, and they fail to advance it much further; indeed, Episode 11, \"Saved,\" serves mainly as a cliffhanger for subsequent seasons. The remaining stories, in which Johnny helps the cops pursue various psychopaths, perverts, missing persons (including a Lennon-esque rock star presumed dead many years before), and such, are good but considerably more pedestrian. Still, while other shows may have cooler special effects, more action, and larger doses of tension-relieving humor,The Dead Zonestands out for its overall smarts and classy production values. Bonus features include deleted scenes, audio commentary on a few episodes, and a featurette focusing on production design.--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000OCXNQW", "B0009A407A", "B00166UFTI", "B0001907BC", "B000092T3Y", "B00LDCGBNE", "B000NOKFGW", "B00006JU81", "B0037AGB9O", "B0081QF6Q8", "B0056GLNQI", "B000MX7V66", "B00JDCP0QA", "B000N3T0EG", "B000ERVJLS", "B0012Z36F8", "B0077PTWY6", "B00133QNSG", "B00AEFXR8I", "B0077PTWHI", "B000FOPPBA", "B00GOC74QG", "B00062IDEW", "B00133QNS6", "B00KTZALDC", "B0030VANIU", "B00CKJJ1IG", "B0051GOB2G", "B000TGURZ8", "B0011FLH00", "B001QE99BA", "B000FS9MY2", "B001CQONMC", "B0013DZNAA", "B003PGNBO8", "B00JK47BHM", "B002KQ6UE2", "B003LXM1B4", "B000JLTRHW", "B007PKSNEI", "B00369ERC4", "B00E96AYYS", "B002BWP2IK", "B001RHGRU2", "B001RXDM2M", "B000E3L7F0", "B000E5N6B6", "B0038MUZ3E", "B000FJH5M2", "B00133QNRW", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B002QZDSW4", "B00022FWEU", "B004SMDJ9U", "B00HUPC5X8", "B0012IXBNC", "B001A7GOCA", "B0016OOM6W", "B003L77GWE", "B001AQR3J4", "B0058EE6OO", "B00B4804LM", "B00DPJEWD4", "B000ELL1QC", "B000FIHN8O", "B00CKJJ1G8", "B000GYI340", "B00KTFJ6J2", "B003LXM1PK", "B005PPMHO2", "B0009JE6FC", "B0012IX35S", "B0000DZSYD", "B00ESK1PES", "B0055SNHQG", "B00IWTVDUW", "B004WO9OMA", "B008H1Q61G", "B003R0MEYA", "B002U0KHME", "B00JF5GAIW", "B0006UEVTK", "B00GOC752E", "B0002J4ZX2", "B00020H9NO", "B0077PTWH8", "B0002S94BQ", "B001ILFUB4", "B00168HARG", "B00GOC75V0", "B0009X76ZA", "B002TQKL7A", "B0009X76XW", "B0000DZSYC", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B000FUTVPA", "B0077PTX0E", "B00IS6WQ2S"], "bought_together": ["B000OCXNQW", "B0009A407A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001907BC", "B000092T3Y", "B0009A407A", "B00166UFTI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 37827}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 4.99, "brand": "LIONSGATE FILMS", "asin": "B000F3UAE8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GN36BQKWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Dead Zone: Season 4"}

{"description": "The Andy Griffith Show's seventh season (1966-67) was the beginning of the end for the venerable family comedy (Griffith brought it to a close with the next season), but the gentle humor and likable characters that helped make it one of the most popular series on television are still in fine form.  Chief among the season's plusses is a two-episode return visit from Don Knotts as Barney Fife--in \"A Visit to Barney Fife,\" Andy helps his former deputy find his footing at his new precinct in Raleigh, North Carolina, while in \"Barney Comes to Mayberry,\" Barney reunites with his old flame, Irene Flogg, now a glamorous movie star. The latter episode, among the most popular of the series, won Knotts his fifth Emmy for portraying Barney. Otherwise, it's business as usual in Mayberry, with series regulars Frances Bavier (Aunt Bee), George Lindsey (Goober), Hal Smith (Otis), and a very grown-up Ron Howard (Opie) delivering their usual warm and funny performances. The show's new face, Jack Dodson (later Mickey Malph onHappy Days) fares considerably better as a Barney substitute than the ill-fated Jack Burns; as mother-dominated town clerk Howard Sprague, Dodson gets some very funny moments, especially in \"Howard the Comedian,\" where he embarrasses the citizens of Mayberry with his TV standup debut. Also on hand: Aneta Corsaut as Helen Crump, Denver Pyle and the Dillards as the hillbilly collective known as the Darling Family, and an ailing Howard McNear as Floyd the barber; McNear had suffered a stroke and lost much of his mobility, but Griffith made arrangements that allowed him to continue on the show in a more relaxed capacity. Though perhaps not up to par with its earlier, black-and-white episodes, the seventh season ofThe Andy Griffith Showstill has plenty of what made the show an enduring classic: low-key charm and homespun humor. The five-disc set has no supplemental features.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000HWZ4IY", "B000EBGE82", "B000BYRCF6", "B000B8I9ZY", "B0009UC7MK", "B0007Y08P6", "B0002NY8PI", "B003SLEDJC", "B00H8KC1N4", "B00LT1JKN2", "B001DHXT4I", "B0018E03CW", "B001JAHQQ6", "B00007IG1K", "B0041SI7B6", "B00JEZWRE4", "B001992NZG", "B00GWJIDB6", "B0001AVZDU", "B0013LRKV2", "B001DHXT66", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B001E549KC", "B00KW02JW0", "B008VNI9EW", "B000E6ES9Y", "B001BN4WHW", "B000VDDE1I", "B008VNI9TC", "B00280QNKG", "B00FM4S8IU", "B001LM64VK", "B0030Y12BO", "B00198X0YK", "B00127IU4S", "B0096RC57O", "B000G6BL7O", "B000YKYT1M", "B00JAD6BYW", "B00KBES386", "B004DCM5RC", "B006UKX63W", "B000EXZFS0", "B0038SUBDC", "B008VNIBTK", "B00004TGYD", "B0009S4IM4", "B00IS6WQ2S", "B002JIOOAS", "B0077T5SBS", "B000EGDANO", "B000CCBCHQ", "B000PISZ86", "B00K3KI4T6", "B00308B170", "B001E6JC26", "B00DXLO086", "B00HQQ7CWA", "B000FSMEB0", "B00IP965IO", "B008L3650M", "B000A9QKSM", "B001LRTT30", "B000O59A1G", "B000HIVIOM", "B0012EM5EW", "B00114XTHK", "B000E3L7EQ", "B000N6UF10", "B000005KXI", "B005SQRYQY", "B000M343AI", "B00I87U8UE", "B0008JIJ1K", "B0002KE2FW", "B00G5N6C8U", "B000GW8U9U", "B000IHYXIK", "B0030BS1E8", "B0063FGERO", "B000HLDF9U", "B004MLEYV4", "B009L4DSV4", "B003IRUFB6", "B000B5XOUM", "B008D9NI54", "B00HMOWA0A", "B00HAT8G8M", "B0018O5WTQ", "B006IRQUIA", "B00FFARI7I", "B000M343B2", "B000FSME1K", "B00I458456", "B001SLNPSO", "B000ERVJMM", "B000BUE5CI", "B001GMH8WO", "B001B187C0", "B0012Q3SZ0"], "bought_together": ["B000HWZ4IY", "B000EBGE82"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BYRCF6", "B0007Y08P6", "B000EBGE82", "B0009UC7MK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 20457}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.73, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B000FSME10", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/613PSDMF4KL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Andy Griffith Show - The Complete Seventh Season"}
{"description": "The teaming of James Stewart and Henry Fonda was a natural:  not only were the two men veteran stars of their generation, but they'd actually been friends and even roommates since early in their careers. These two Westerns offer the stars in their relaxed end-of-career mode, with Stewart in the hero roles and Fonda as either villain or burr-under-the-saddle sidekick.Firecreekis a grim 1968 Western that carries a strong residual aroma ofHigh Noon. Stewart plays a farmer who happens to be the nominal (but rarely needed) sheriff of Firecreek, which means he must go into service when Fonda and his scurvy bunch of desperados (among them Gary Lockwood and Jack Elam) come to town looking for trouble. This slow, stripped-down picture has a philosophical undertone, with Fonda's weary, wounded outlaw trading bitter wisdom with local girl Inger Stevens. It goes on too long and Stewart is in the phase of coasting on his familiar persona, but overall it's a decent little Western fable.The Cheyenne Social Club, from 1970, gets off to a marvelous start, with a sequence of saddle tramps Stewart and Fonda riding across half the West as Fonda maintains a fractured monologue throughout. Screenwriter James Lee Barrett was a veteran who worked frequently with Stewart (Shenandoah) and John Wayne, and some of the Western flavor is fine, but... things turn crass as soon as the pals realize Stewart has inherited a bordello in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Everybody except Fonda overacts mercilessly, and director Gene Kelly--yes, that Gene Kelly--indulges a leering style that undercuts some of the authentic laughs. Shirley Jones is around to provide comfort at the club; some predictable gunplay is mixed in with the jokes. However middling these two films might be in the filmographies of their formidable stars, it must be said that the widescreen transfer of both films to DVD is very good.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B006VRRGOO", "B00008CMT3", "B00AEFYTEY", "B003552QX6", "B004RPQSS2", "B00BTYU3UI", "B00004TJQK", "B000FTCLQW", "B001DDBD4K", "B00018D404", "B00008CMT1", "B000OT6V0U", "B00005JLV5", "B000031EGW", "B00AEFYPHA", "B00009AVA5", "B000063UQO", "B000G6N0HI", "B00AEBB8W4", "B000UPMZ1W", "B000FZETR0", "B000QRI1GW", "B0017CW5H6", "B000056H2H", "B008D1R52E", "B00008CMSY", "B0014BQR1A", "B00AEFXSVE", "B005HIBWT8", "B0018O4RT2", "B00195I3P4", "B0009X75WE", "B00008CMRO", "B0007PALJS", "B000EHSVW8", "B00AMDA2OY", "B0007ZEOCS", "B00004XMV9", "B004GJYRBY", "B0007MANYY", "B0000549B0", "B004GSVX8A", "B00008CMRL", "B00AEFXUL2", "B0007M21Z8", "B00AEBB932", "B00008CMT0", "B0007QS24S", "B00C3ALLFS", "B009AGEZKQ", "B0001Z3I0I", "B005AMJ31U", "078322592X", "B00008CMT4", "B000ANVPP6", "B000O599YE", "B003552QXG", "B00008MTW6", "0783228031", "B000056H2E", "B000O599NK", "B0018QAIY8", "B00AEFY6ZQ", "B00195I3OK", "B000ANVPPQ", "B0045HCJSK", "B0007MAO0C", "B00023P4RY", "B00008CMR4", "B0082LUFA4", "B000NQRR34", "B00BPFPNCE", "B008L3650W", "B000FTCLR6", "B0001FVDW8", "B00008DDGW", "B000BITVBA", "B000056H2I", "B000EHSVWS", "B000063INF", "B00AEFYL6K", "B000O599LW", "B00005LOL0", "B00AEBBA0E", "B00008MTW5", "B00008CMR6", "B00BCMSYDU", "B007Y1NR1W", "B000BDH6DU", "B00AEBB8YM", "B00575GYUI", "B003RHZ666", "B0007PALKC", "B00195I3PE"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFYTEY", "B00004TJQK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B006VRRGOO", "B00AEFYTEY", "B003552QX6", "B001DDBD4K"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9582}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000FTCLQC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51bfHW34glL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Cheyenne Social Club / Firecreek"}
{"description": "Based on the 1868 classic British detective novelThe Moonstoneby Wilkie Collins, this 1972 BBC drama is a 221-minute, five-part period piece that seems almost theatrical thanks to its thespian delivery, scarcity of background music, and intent focus on character development.  While the pace is leisurely and the dialogue sometimes difficult to discern, the story is most intriguing: A stolen Indian jewel makes its way to England and its curse threatens to destroy Rachel Verinder and her entire family even after it is stolen from the Verinder home.  The best detectives fail to resolve the case and the repercussions ripple for many years as the plot twists and turns, love ebbs and flows, anger and deceit roil, and mysticism and science vie for supremacy.  Featured talents are Robin Ellis, John Welsh, Basil Dignam, Vivien Heilbron and Peter Sallis and DVD extras include a Wilkie Collins biography and cast filmographies.--Tami Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009OL92K", "B005T0OY5S", "B000A8AXXG", "B00005JOA0", "B0000AQS3P", "B007A2O3FO", "B001MDI9S4", "B00006HAZH", "B00HUAGYF8", "B000BNTMKK", "B000PFUA7S", "B00HUAGZ34", "B000EBD9VC", "B00GD7UO4G", "B004JMSIQS", "B0074FUSFG", "B0001WTUJO", "B009L2EW5W", "B0080QOL10", "B00B89WZG4", "B000E0ODZE", "B000BKDNX0", "B003CP1T50", "B001B4VXWS", "B008UQUS26", "B001P807RC", "B004JMSIVI", "B0077PBPVE", "B00GWXI20E", "B000FQIRXQ", "B00GWXI16O", "B00B83OIVA", "B001PU8N0I", "B00HYZ0ZLS", "B0013NAMLK", "B00008DDRZ", "B00GD7UO6E", "B00DW5ILF6", "B0001WTUK8", "B0011VJRVU", "B00A8KJLPM", "B00062IZ0Y", "B0009PVZM8", "B000GIXLUC", "B002XTBEDS", "B00HHYF548", "B005X5XIMO", "B00GWXI1F0", "B0090XLDO0", "B000Z27HLS", "B00BMQODEU", "6305106959", "B00GHH9I62", "B0009PVZIW", "B00005YUNK", "B009T6CXG0", "B000WVPXAO", "B00018WENM", "B00BQXTDIU", "B0000A5A3A", "B0030Y11T2", "B00GAHJO8G", "B00GO4RHD4", "B0009PVZL4", "B009DS3VQA", "B000LPS34E", "B008RO6PJQ", "B005N8KP3Q", "B0080QOL1A", "B000M2E32M", "B00JJRLFVS", "B00D2UMHPG", "0767020308", "B002DY9KR0", "B0007Y3XRG", "B0000CE684", "B000ECX0O2", "B004SI5VUO", "B001GJ4U5A", "B00HGE90Z4", "B0007LFPJ8", "B00E3UN66I", "B00A27OJ94", "B00D49YDR0", "B0009S4INI", "B0083HXKAY", "0486424510", "B00B62R9XM", "B00F1BFRA6", "B000062XDX", "B0047CTO90", "B004N66XYE", "B009YX8MKO", "B00BDSRM4K", "B005DVIOIG", "B00FPPQYXM", "B00140PK6O", "B009DS6YGO", "B00IBKXP8A", "B00D49YDDY"], "bought_together": ["B000A8AXXG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001MDI9S4", "B0009OL92K", "B0080QOL10", "B000A8AXXG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 181103}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 35.71, "brand": "ELLIS,ROBIN", "asin": "B000GAKFI6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G18T80MWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Moonstone"}

An aspiring novelist, his greatest achievement is a co-credit on an over-the-top TV soap, and his romantic life is equally disappointing.

{"description": "Beginning its six-year run in 1982,St. Elsewherewas neither television's first ensemble medical drama nor, heaven knows, its last. Yet this four-disc set of all 22 episodes from the first season is a reminder that this was, and still is, one of the very best. Even now, when \"reality\" programming blights the landscape like some biblical plague, doc, cop, and lawyer shows remain staples of the medium, and while the likes ofC.S.I.,E.R., andGrey's Anatomyhave it all overSt. Elsewherein the sizzle department--the production values are much flashier, the content sexier, more graphic, and faster-moving, the technology both in front of and behind the camera light years more sophisticated--the older show, despite its somewhat cheesy '70s vibe, is the hands-down winner when it comes to the actual steak. That's because it does it the old-fashioned way: by relying on good writing, vividly-drawn, identifiable characters, and excellent performances by an eye-opening group of actors.Co-creators Joshua Brand and John Falsey's pilot episode, which establishes the scene at Boston's St. Eligius Hospital (mocked as \"St. Elsewhere\" due to its rundown facilities and reputation as a \"dumping ground\" for the poor and disenfranchised), isn't especially promising. While we can see right away that the show sports a lighter, more humorous tone than others of its genre, the direction is static, the acting and dialogue are often stiff, and what passes for \"chaos\" is pretty tame. But it hits its stride almost immediately thereafter, as the characters (including Howie Mandel's wisecracking Dr. Fiscus, David Morse's driven, committed Dr. Morrison, William Daniels' egotistical, pompous Dr. Craig, and Ed Begley, Jr.'s nerdy Dr. Ehrlich) are more fully realized. The cast, in fact, may be the most impressive ever assembled for a TV program: in the first season alone, the list of actors with regular, recurring, and one-shot appearances includes future movie stars Denzel Washington (a regular, but his role is minor), Tim Robbins, Ally Sheedy, Christopher Guest, Laraine Newman, Ray Liotta, Tom Hulce, Michael Madsen, and Rae Dawn Chong. Sure, some of the multiple storylines are dated: the handling of issues like gun control, immigration, and terrorism seems almost quaint by today's standards, and a running gag concerning ladies man Dr. Samuels' (David Birney) having to inform his many lovers that he has gonorrhea comes off as tasteless and unfunny, notwithstanding that era's low awareness of AIDS and other STDs. But on the whole, thisSt. Elsewhereset (extras include audio commentary for \"Cora and Arnie,\" plus four featurettes) is a reminder of episodic TV at its best.--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BOH8YG", "B000EHSVC8", "B000K7VHJ6", "B00005JLFT", "B00188XHF8", "B00GHH9HUE", "B00D2UMHVA", "B00GSTHCHQ", "B00HRUQA6O", "B001U9BS2O", "B004STBF2G", "B00188XHFI", "B00GLT2TR6", "B005DLN1LG", "B00144K5LK", "B004STBF5S", "B00KWP6JMG", "B00KYCA4QY", "B00005JO3P", "B00I4581F4", "B00KTFJ7UA", "B0001XAQ96", "B006WK4Y6I", "B0000EMYGP", "B000EXDS0C", "B000BX0VU0", "B000SMNK16", "B002NN7EXS", "B000BZISRG", "B00005JNJ1", "B00KTFJ6J2", "B004STBFPS", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B001AQT158", "B00GHH9HW2", "B00FM4S8H6", "B000TGURZ8", "B00IRIMGTA", "B00I3RHUX2", "B00JHH1VUU", "B0015XHR5C", "B00JBBRKSE", "B001FSKE8E", "B00008PHCZ", "B004STBFI0", "B00ITAQ2T6", "630276646X", "B00FWMVVK4", "B001JAHQ1G", "B006WK4Y8Q", "B001JAHQ1Q", "B00HZMZ286", "B000HT3P56", "B004STBEXQ", "B000NDEXO8", "B00005JLF3", "B000EHSVBE", "B005FQ2HBO", "B000JJSLA8", "B00HW3EXCE", "B003L77FY8", "B00HRUQB5O", "B000YKYT1M", "B00008NV4G", "B000WMA74A", "B000HWZ4HU", "B00GOC74QG", "B000MTEFUK", "B00EIXWMII", "0783230532", "B005KK2FTO", "B000CS45AG", "B0007XBMA2", "B00005JO9J", "B00008WJEY", "B000IMV3XS", "B004MLEYV4", "B000EGDAF2", "B00ECHBSP8", "B000F8O2MO", "B000GW8UAE", "B001L1S1OO", "B000BGR1B4", "B0009UC80Q", "B00369ERC4", "B00018D3RI", "B0006N2EZA", "B00005JNEQ", "B00005JO4F", "B0001HAGQK", "B0035CVB2Q", "B0000633QV", "B00HNGC56G", "B00005JOXR", "B000B8IA3U", "B002XKKX8E", "B00FWMVVI6", "B0002NY8R6", "B00J5LXT44"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLFT"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00GSTHCHQ", "B000BOH8YG", "B00005JLFT", "B00D2UMHVA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 24316}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 18.2, "brand": "20TH Century Fox", "asin": "B000GPPNO2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PSPQFYRQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "St. Elsewhere - Season 1"}

{"description": "\"Size of package does not indicate quality within,\" Honolulu's finest, Charlie Chan sagely observes inCharlie Chan at the Circus, and while this boxed set contains only four films, it does this venerable franchise justice, with some of Chan's most arresting cinematic outings. All four films star Swedish-born Warner Oland, who is to Charlie Chan what Sean Connery is to James Bond. The high note of this set isCharlie Chan at the Opera, in which the curtain comes down on two opera singers during a performance. Boris Karloff (whose frightening presence accounts for a very funny reference toFrankenstein) costars as an amnesiac who escapes from a sanitarium to haunt the theatre like some phantom of the... well, you know. William Demarest steals his scenes as a cop in dire need of sensitivity training. He refers to Chan as \"Chop Suey\" and \"Egg Fu Young,\" and when No. 1 son (Keye Luke) gives his dad a note, he asks if it's a laundry ticket. InCharlie Chan at the Circus, a Chan family excursion (with all 12 children!) to the Big Top is interrupted when the nasty circus owner is murdered.Charlie Chan at the Olympicsis another gold-medal outing that finds Chan embroiled in international espionage when an experimental automatic pilot device is stolen. His investigation leads him to the Berlin Olympics (via the Hindenburg), where his son is on the track team. Newsreel footage of the games integrated into the film features Jesse Owens running the 400-meter relay. Less of a sure bet but still an efficient mystery isCharlie Chan at the Race Track. Each restored film looks great, and each is enhanced with featurettes that illuminate interesting aspects of the series. One profiles prolificChandirector H. Bruce \"Lucky\" Humberstone (who, we learn, fortified his star with drink), and another Keye Luke. \"Charlie Chan at the Movies\" examines these films' places in theChancanon.

{"description": "Lo and behold,Clerks IIdefies the odds as a sequel that even the most ardentClerksfans can be happy about. Twelve years after Kevin Smith turned the independent film world upside-down with his $27,000 black-and-white comedy, perpetual slackers Dante (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson) return for another raucous romp in suburbia, but this time there's no beloved Quick Stop mini-mart to ensure their low-level employment. Now they're aimless 33-year-olds flippin' burgers at Mooby's, a fast-food joint with a cow theme that's \"udderly delicious.\" Dante's engaged to his long-time girlfriend but has unexpectedly fallen in love with Mooby's manager Becky (and since she's played by Rosario Dawson, can you blame him?), and Randal's still holding out for life, liberty, and the pursuit of low ambition. The responsibilities of adulthood are rearing their ugly head, and with Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith) still dealing weed and generally being obnoxious, well... something's gotta give, right? The way Smith has written this long-awaited follow-up, the dilemmas of Dante, Randal, and their ongoing friendship are something that anyone can relate to, and with Dawson lighting up the screen (in a role demanded by producer Harvey Weinstein to boost box-office appeal), the movie's romantic chemistry is surprisingly delightful. Rest assured, also, that Smith (shooting mostly in color this time, on a $5 million budget) hasn't forgotten where he came from:Clerks IIis jam-packed with the same lewd, crude humor that madeClerksan indie-film phenomenon, and Smith's good-natured sincerity is still on full display, ensuring that only the most prudish viewers could possibly be offended. For everyone else, this is as enjoyable as any sequel could ever hope to be, with amusing cameos by Smith-movie veterans Ben Affleck and Jason Lee, among others.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SIP6LS", "B00000IQW4", "B004SIP8ES", "B004XVMCH6", "B007D0FUTG", "B00003CWOL", "B004U7MQW4", "B001KKU9DW", "B005FUTBWS", "B0016MJ6GA", "B00007149S", "B000CPH9PM", "B004SIP6N6", "B001CDFY4Q", "B000I0QLOQ", "B000ICL3L0", "B000EMGJAO", "1592406890", "B001OD4S50", "B000JJ4DNW", "B00068WOH8", "B0018BZEOC", "B005G5NPLA", "B0023TCWE8", "B00363WGBO", "B0002V7TMY", "B007D0FVYA", "B00003CXPS", "B000A7DVR2", "B001J9KJ4I", "0783230338", "B000BBOUCC", "B00009MGEM", "B000093FLA", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000031EFY", "B001C0JCBA", "B006WXHJLC", "B00029LO5E", "B001MFNB58", "0783227434", "B002ZG96ZC", "0800141687", "B008220BGQ", "B00007AJGM", "B0050PYNP8", "B00441GYVA", "B000M9CB4W", "1592407447", "B00BEIYH1A", "B00AEFXVW0", "B000WC3864", "B00AEFZ7F4", "B003VPX5Y4", "0767837398", "B005LAII12", "B000BYA5G4", "B009AMALGM", "B000AARKXA", "B00003CXS7", "B000GBEWGQ", "B000AXWHSA", "B004QL7K70", "0783229526", "B00005JN2Z", "B002O3Z4VG", "B00B4VSUBK", "B000WZEZGI", "B000VXWX7E", "B002ZG97XI", "B00BPEJWAE", "B008RNYMG0", "184856497X", "B00860YIJU", "B004SIP8ZM", "B004EPZ084", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00008975Z", "B00005JM23", "B000IZJZIU", "B003Y5H5C4", "B006TTC50Y", "B004SEUJFK", "B00E1HIX66", "B00005JKMN", "B00005JKHP", "B000069CF0", "B00007ELER", "B009DA743Y", "B001G5T6GW", "B00004TJMW", "B0006HBZE2", "B00005JNZU", "B00029RTAI", "B004UXUWEC", "B0018RKEQE", "6305551235", "B007WW94TW"], "bought_together": ["B004SIP6LS", "B00000IQW4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004SIP6LS", "B00000IQW4", "B0016MJ6GA", "B004SIP8ES"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14519}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.25, "brand": "Weinstein Company", "asin": "B000I0RNVQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51tIUlFx1EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Clerks II (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Pile together a blue-ribbon cast, a screenplay high in quirkiness, and the Sundance stamp of approval, and youve got yourself a crossover indie hit. That formula worked for Little Miss Sunshine, a frequently hilarious study of family dysfunction. Meet the Hoovers, an Albuquerque clan riddled with depression, hostility, and the tattered remnants of the American Dream; despite their flakiness, they manage to pile into a VW van for a weekend trek to L.A. in order to get moppet daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) into the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. Much of the pleasure of this journey comes from watching some skillful comic actors doing their thing: Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette as the parents (hes hoping to become a self-help authority), Alan Arkin as a grandfather all too willing to give uproariously inappropriate advice to a sullen teenage grandson (Paul Dano), and a subdued Steve Carell as a jilted gay professor on the verge of suicide. The film is a crowd-pleaser, and if anything is a little too eager to bend itself in the direction of quirk-loving Sundance audiences; it can feel forced. But the breezy momentum and the ingenious actors help push the material over any bumps in the road. -- Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000YABYLA", "B00005JMJG", "B001UV4XGU", "B00A81MV3U", "B00DL46ZN8", "B00005JNC2", "B0007TKOAA", "B001UV4XUG", "B00005ALS0", "B00118T632", "B00AEFXESQ", "B007L6VR12", "B008220BA2", "B003L20ICE", "B0000640VJ", "B008OHV49W", "B001P9KR8U", "B000A7DVR2", "B00000F5MN", "B007L6VRBM", "B00AFEY354", "B0001GOH6Q", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00337KM2S", "B000H0MKOC", "B004UXUX4Q", "B0034G4OZE", "B00011CZRE", "B00275EGWY", "0205751989", "B000FVQLQQ", "B0010X8NF0", "B004SIP95G", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B004QL7KKC", "B00079Z9VO", "B00003CXZ4", "B0021L8UOY", "B001MM3AZM", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00606P0BM", "B00005Q4CS", "B00ADRYCWC", "B001TOD92C", "B004SEUIW4", "B000P0J0EW", "B0015OKWKI", "B000CS464G", "B0007PLLBU", "B00009W5CA", "B00005JLSB", "B004A8ZWV0", "B007RKFXUS", "B0010AN7Z4", "B00012QLB4", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B003UESJH4", "B00005JNBQ", "B007VYE4PK", "B000WZEZGI", "B00AEBB9F0", "6304907729", "B003Y5H574", "B000SFOW8I", "B00005JMJ4", "B001BL96K2", "B00006FMUW", "B002VPTJOA", "B00003CXO1", "B000J103OI", "B0038N9WKU", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00008975Z", "B003ASLJQI", "B0049985XW", "B003ASLJO0", "B001J9KJ4I", "B001FZQOW2", "B00000G02H", "1557047707", "B000BYRCQU", "B00121QGPY", "B00005JL57", "B000021Y77", "B000A3XY5A", "B000MZHW40", "B0000AC8LR", "B00AEFY0KW", "B0045HCJ9E", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B00AEBB9FA", "B00005A06N", "B000ELJAEM", "B00AEFYAMA", "B00E8RKHWW", "B00005JLRE", "B005LAIHE0", "B000M341QE", "B0039UT3LK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00118T632", "B00DL46ZN8", "B0007UC8Y4", "B001AGXEAG"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 401537}, "asin": "B000JU9OJ4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51T7A7BDBWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Little Miss Sunshine [Region 2]"}

{"description": "Jump roping that's worlds away from anything seen on the local playground bursts from the screen in this Disney Original Movie about the clash between two athletes and their respective sports.  Boxer Izzy Daniels (Corbin Bleu) has a hard time taking neighbor Mary's (Keke Palmer) devotion to jump roping seriously, but as Izzy trains relentlessly to maintain his undefeated status and win the Golden Glove, Mary's team practices just as intensely for the city Double Dutch finals.  Izzy gains a reluctant respect for Mary's sport when he accompanies his sister Karin (Kylee Russell) to a competition, but it takes some serious convincing to persuade him to fill in for a teammate who's abandon the team on the cusp of city finals.  Izzy quickly discovers that Double Dutch is more demanding and rewarding than he'd ever imagined, but when the entire school finds out about his newest sporting exploit, he's taunted into quitting.  As Izzy tries to regain his boxing focus, he suddenly realizes that winning the Golden Glove is more his father's (David Reivers) dream than his own.  After some serious soul-searching, Izzy decides that he can't let what others think keep him from doing what makes him happy.  This action-packed Disney Channel Original Movie takes a unique look at the varied world of sports and features some great catchy new music from Corbin Bleu and Jordan Pruitt, but the game-winner is its focus on the importance of following one's heart.

{"description": "Not your typical star-studded or star-spangled war film, cult-fave director Samuel Fuller'sFixed Bayonetsis a viscerally thrilling  Korean War drama of one platoon's trial, and one corporal's baptism, under fire. Morale is high but the ammo is low for an American division hunkered down in the mountains of Korea. Certain massacre awaits if they retreat. To give \"15,000 men a break,\" 48 \"of our toughest combat men\" are selected to stay behind and trick the \"commies\" into thinking the entire division is in place while the others escape safely across a river.Fixed Bayonetsis raw and brutal in the best Fuller tradition. The backgrounds are obvious fakes, and the platoon members sport the usual war movie nicknames like Whitey, Rock, Jonesy, and \"Mr. Belvedere\" (he's the resident know-it-all). But all else has the authentic ring of reportage, as in a powerful scene when the men cluster together to rub their feet to ward off frostbite. Richard Basehart stars as Denno, who can \"take an order, but can't give one\" until his three superiors are knocked off one by one, leaving him in command. This rueful exchange--\"They told me this was going to be a police action.\" \"Why didn't they send the cops?\"--is as close as Fuller gets to geopolitics. For war-movie buffs, he does deliver pounding and tense action sequences. In one harrowing scene, a medic must navigate a minefield to try and rescue a wounded sergeant and retrieve the only map to the field.. But he is resolutely unsentimental and more interested in the ravaged, human face of war. These are faces you will not soon forget (one of them, reportedly, belongs to James Dean, but this film is so gripping, one is hard-pressed to make the effort to try to spot him).--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00CHYSSME", "0792841662", "B000NO1XJA", "B0015S2OWI", "B000NTPG66", "B000EHSVVO", "B000EHSVVE", "B00005PJ8K", "B00143XE0U", "B00096S4BM", "B0001NBMHQ", "B00H8J2NW4", "B00096S4B2", "B00005ASGB", "B0029778T8", "B00005OSJQ", "B000MGBLJG", "B005DIA0IQ", "B000QXDFS0", "B00HZOXRCC", "B00AEFXLKC", "B0007TKNLU", "B005HQBO9I", "B00C2535TE", "B007HCI42A", "B00005JN9P", "B000MGBLJ6", "B000EMGJFE", "B0007TKNDI", "B00008R9M6", "B000063URX", "B004VGHF7K", "B0001NBMGC", "B00008AOTO", "B000NTPG6Q", "B000E5N6KW", "B000H1RFSM", "B0008ENHU8", "B00005PJ8L", "B0085A9K62", "B00005B1YH", "B000EHSVV4", "B000MGBLIW", "B00KIZYDCI", "B000MRA542", "B0007TKNLA", "B00D3XMA9A", "B00005R23T", "B0002V8OAK", "B00BY0EBK0", "B0001FVDGE", "B000066C6H", "B005OTGS4E", "B00005B1YF", "B0001WTWWE", "B00008MTY1", "B003EYEEI8", "B0001NBMH6", "B002DNLT1Q", "B000063URW", "B000EHSVUK", "B0076XTIWU", "B005HQBO9S", "B000O78L0U", "B004R6EFAO", "B000A2WJBQ", "B004U7EIES", "B0001NBMI0", "B000062XEX", "B005DTZXMI", "B004GSVXBW", "B00008AOTR", "B00CZ7ALDM", "B00JX3SHIC", "B000E0WJN2", "B0005C9MQ6", "B00008PC0Z", "B004R6EF9U", "B003B3NV5E", "B0001FVDIC", "B004SJVQ4I", "B000NTPG5W", "B003GW94EM", "B008F0QBB4", "B0000AMRUP", "B00CHYSPJ0", "B004IFYMXO", "B00B27WRNI", "B005DKS1TE", "B00D3XM7H0", "0792841670", "B005H6RF8M", "B00KIZY3XW", "B00005N5S3", "B001PO55LE", "B004176JJY", "B00096S4DA", "B005MXQD4W", "B000EHSVSC", "B005L399BW"], "bought_together": ["B00CHYSSME"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00CHYSSME", "B007HCI42A", "B00C2535TE", "B0015S2OWI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 79174}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.44, "brand": "BASEHART,RICHARD", "asin": "B000MGBLIC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51s-tZY105L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fixed Bayonets"}
