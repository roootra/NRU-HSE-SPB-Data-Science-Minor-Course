{"description": "Campbell Scott plays a green young technocrat who invents a secret and highly successful high-tech process that, it appears, most of the free world would like to get their hands on. His own company may not be dealing with him fairly, and competitors are lurking around every street corner and kiddie carousel in New York (not to mention Caribbean hideaways) hoping to steal, cajole, or trick him out of the formula. The plot is as full of switchbacks as a mountain highway, and the delights are in watching it unfold around Scott, who is not so much of a naif that he doesn't catch on that not only his formula, but his life, are in dire danger.

{"description": "Based on Jon Krakauer'sbestselling book,Into Thin Airre-creates an ill-fated 1996 expedition to Everest that claimed at least five lives, including those of two world-class climbers. Only 90 minutes in length, the film jumps right into the action at Everest base camp and compresses the two-month trek into just a few days of exhilarating adventure. Periodic voice-overs by Krakauer (Christopher McDonald) provide essential background information and guide us through the invisible, intensifying effects of altitude and stress. Krakauer joined the trip to write an article on the commercialization of Everest, but as conditions on the mountain deteriorate he is forced to focus all his energy on survival.Unfortunately the film fails to really develop any of its characters before thrusting them onto the harrowing face of Everest. As a result, it's difficult to understand the relationships that play out as the group struggles to the summit and back. While the trio of leading actors is solid, only Nat Parker (who plays guide Rob Hall) has enough screen time to develop an interesting, complex character. Peter Horton's portrayal of unconventional guide Scott Fischer is almost hyperbolic and McDonald's Krakauer is stiff and difficult to read.While the film succeeds in creating a palpable sense of agony and suspense, those in search of a more thoughtful, detailed account of the expedition will be better served by reading the book.--Claire Campbell", "price": 17.5, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 480944}, "asin": "0767814908", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519T0CC8CHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Into Thin Air: Death on Everest [VHS]"}
{"description": "Bugsyrepresents an almost miraculous combination of director, writer, and star on a project that represents a career highlight for everyone involved. It's one of the best American gangster movies ever made--as good in its own way as any of theGodfatherfilms--and it's impossible to imagine anyone better than Beatty in the movie's flashy title role. As notorious mobster and Las Vegas visionary \"Bugsy\" Siegel, Beatty is perfectly cast as a man whose dreams are greater than his ability to realize them--or at least, greater than his ability to stay alive while making those dreams come true. With a glamorous Hollywood mistress (Annette Bening) who shares Bugsy's dream while pursuing her own upwardly mobile agenda, Bugsy seems oblivious to threats when he begins to spend too much of the mob's money on the creation of the Flamingo casino. Meyer Lansky (Ben Kingsley) and Mickey Cohen (Harvey Keitel) will support Bugsy's wild ambition to a point, after which all bets are off, and Bugsy's life hangs in the balance. From the obvious chemistry of Beatty and Bening (who met and later married off-screen) to the sumptuous reproduction of 1940s Hollywood, every detail in this movie feels impeccably right. Beatty is simply mesmerizing as the man who invented Las Vegas but never saw it thrive, moving from infectious idealism to brutal violence in the blink of an eye. Director Barry Levinson is also in peak form here, guiding the stylish story with a subtle balance of admiration and horror; we can catch Bugsy's Vegas fever and root for the gangster's success, but we know he'll get what he deserves. We might wish that Bugsy had lived to see his dream turn into a booming oasis, but the movie doesn't suggest that we should shed any tears.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004U103", "B00013RC2U", "B004G7XCRQ", "B0000AMJEK", "B002954A4Q", "B007TBIUSM", "B00000JGHJ", "B000068QPV", "B0000DI87S", "B000E5KQHI", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000EHSVRI", "B000C20VPA", "B0010YVCI4", "B00008RH3L", "B001C0I61M", "B00004XPPB", "B000E8NRBC", "B00CMDPT3Q", "B000P0J09M", "0792838076", "6305297142", "0792846877", "B000GG4Y32", "B0019CUG02", "B000286RP2", "B002EAYDN4", "B004YCKKFK", "B008XTVWMU", "B002QEHPQU", "B004JKS996", "6305428522", "B000C1VAFG", "B0001EFV7C", "B00AEFY7NM", "B0007G89FK", "B00007G1YP", "B00080ZG10", "B001EKP5D2", "B00005JP93", "B008R65XYC", "B00005AA9C", "B00009Y3PV", "B00005T7I1", "B0000AM6JI", "B000N3T0H8", "B004FQX59I", "B00005V9HH", "B00005IA7Y", "B000C20VRS", "0792838068", "B002CPMB9O", "B00CCMKPO0", "B000063K2Q", "B008YAPRQK", "B000ERVKBC", "B002VWNICC", "B000P0J0AG", "B0006OEXTE", "B000NQPZCO", "B0018CMJSU", "B00AEFYTMQ", "B007NE08LM", "B00H9KKGTO", "B0006HBV3C", "B0002V7O5Q", "B00AEBB95K", "B001EIOOV8", "B0006GAOJA", "B00AEFXN9G", "0767830555", "B005S9ELVC", "B004SIP7TE", "B0006GANN2", "B0019UGYK0", "B00441GYPG", "B0009HMTGC", "B0064MT1FI", "B003HE4FAC", "B0003JANSW", "1451635672", "B00E96AZBK", "B000CNESTE", "B000M341QE", "B0006HBLUK", "B00007M57P", "B00005LC4D", "B0001FGBUW", "1467907898", "B007N31YH0", "B007UW9W5U", "B00BMJ7ZKG", "B00FRILRL6", "B00008975Z", "0792844831", "B0000542CB", "1607105829", "B001DW2BJW", "B000AQ69SG", "B00AEFXVOI"], "bought_together": ["B00004U103", "B0000AMJEK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002V7T0G", "B00004U103", "B00013RC2U", "B000EHSVRI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 217388}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.74, "brand": "", "asin": "0767818059", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XE61M6B7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bugsy"}

{"description": "For better or worse, David Mamet's hit playSexual Perversity in Chicagois watered down into this romantic comedy about a couple (played by Rob Lowe and Demi Moore) who get together and then fall apart due to Lowe's character's inability to commit. Jim Belushi is on hand as the gratuitously swinish best friend who looks at women as meat, and Elizabeth Perkins is entertainingly arch as Moore's gal pal and Belushi's nemesis. There's nothing about this 1986 film by Edward Zwick (cocreator of TV'sthirtysomethingand director ofGloryandCourage Under Fire) that is at all reminiscent of Mamet, but that doesn't make it bad or dull. While one can feel the script straining to fill in gaps where chunks of the original play have disappeared, Zwick often successfully tells the story without words at all, relying on the actors to convey pure emotion. Lowe is good, and the then-willowy Moore's understated performance reminds one of the actress she might have been before she became a spectacle.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0043X1FOU", "B000002UC1", "B00GM5LL28", "B002EAYE92", "B000PMFRYC", "B0018QPPXW", "B000GAKDAG", "B00AG475K8", "B000065V3H", "B000059TGG", "B00J11U57C", "B000QXDCLA", "B008FYZHDI", "B002JOUNE8", "B00013WWT8", "B00004Y87M", "B00AG473GE", "B00AEFY4CG", "B001AEF6BS", "B00KNALRZ4", "B000053VB4", "B000065V3G", "B00IVLRA62", "B001AEF6BI", "B0002WZTOI", "B0045HCIYA", "B00AMEZDN8", "B00000K3D1", "B004YCKJSS", "B00AEFYRP0", "B00005Y1UX", "B001Q8MMBK", "B000053VB5", "6305310335", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B00IGBI052", "B00005JLFA", "B000XJD33O", "B0009R1TJ0", "B001BGS16W", "B00000G3I2", "B00D2UMHVK", "B00AEFXR1K", "B00009OWJY", "B00081U7HC", "B00AEFXZ1C", "B006TTC50Y", "B002AS463W", "B0080JG2PK", "B00KQTGWPC", "B005FQ2HEQ", "B00GOZ2LPM", "B0001CNRBG", "B0001AVZ9O", "B00005V5NS", "B000B5XOSY", "B0007W6HVM", "B00008978P", "B003Y5H58S", "B0007QJ1XE", "B008XTVWMU", "0767812158", "B003EYVXOQ", "B0000DIXDR", "B00JPFTW1E", "B0001EFTSS", "B002L7VFR2", "B00005TNER", "B0045HCJJ4", "B00I9CSXGO", "6305428484", "B00AEFXZJE", "B00EMAGKNU", "B0000V492E", "B00IXD2LI0", "B00006472Q", "B0043X1FKY", "B00AEBB9IM", "B00009WVSL", "0783240201", "B002GOAGZC", "B00000K0DR", "0800141741", "B00009AOAY", "B00018YC3M", "B005QX8UEE", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B005FHHD80", "B003ASXMTA", "B00GUO2SKA", "B000MGB6NM", "B00005V4XV", "B00AEFY5TI", "B00001W9G0", "B00BTYIHWO", "6305236569", "B00JJ3EH6C", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B00H47IX5G", "B000193318"], "bought_together": ["B0043X1FOU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0045O2PF0", "B00J11U57C", "B00DRQETCY", "B0043X1FOU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 36256}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.59, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "0767818016", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514pCNkuX0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "About Last Night"}

{"description": "As the French New Wave was reaching its maturity and filmgoing had evolved as a favorite pastime of intellectuals and urban sophisticates, along came Jean-Luc Godard to shake up every convention and send highfalutin critics scrambling to their typewriters. 1965'sAlphavilleis a perfect example of Godard's willingness to disrupt expectation, combine genres, and comment on movies while making sociopolitical statements that inspired doctoral theses and left a majority of viewers mystified. Part science fiction and part hard-boiled detective yarn,Alphavillepresents a futuristic scenario using the most modern and impersonal architecture that Godard could find in mid-'60s Paris. A haggard private eye (Eddie Constantine) is sent to an ultramodern city run by a master computer, where his mission is to locate and rescue a scientist who is trapped there. As the story unfolds on Godard's strictly low-budget terms, the movie tackles a variety of topics such as the dehumanizing effect of technology, willful suppression of personality, saturation of commercial products, and, of course, the constant recollection of previous films through Godard's carefully chosen images. For most peopleAlphaville, like many of the director's films, will prove utterly baffling.

{"description": "Now you can achieve multiple viewings of the bestSexon TV.  Winner of Golden Globes for Best TV Series and Best Actress,Sex and the Cityis based on Candace Bushnell's provocativebestselling book. Sarah Jessica  Parker stars as Carrie Bradshaw, a self-described \"sexual anthropologist,\" who writes \"Sex and the City,\" a newspaper column that chronicles the state of sexual affairs of Manhattanites in this \"age of un-innocence.\" Her \"posse,\" including nice girl Charlotte (Kristin Davis), hard-edged Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), and party girl  Samantha (Kim Cattrall)--not to mention her own tumultuous love life--gives Carrie plenty of column fodder. Over the course of the first season's 12&nbsp;episodes, the most prominent dramatic arc concerns Carrie, who goes from turning the tables on \"toxic bachelors\" by having \"sex like a man\" to wanting to join the ranks of \"the monogamists\" with the elusive Mr.&nbsp;Big (Chris Noth). Meanwhile, Miranda, Cynthia, and Samantha have their own dating woes, few of which can be described on a family Web site.Seinfeldhas nothing onSex and the Citywhen it comes to shallow, self-absorbed characters or coining catch phrases. Episode&nbsp;2, for example, introduces the term \"modelizer\": a guy who is obsessed with and will only date models. Some may accuse this series of male bashing. But women, after years of enduring shows with \"men behaving badly,\" will relish the equal time. Some may blanch at the ladies' graphic language and ribald humor, or dismiss some of the situations as unrealistic (Carrie doesn't bat an eye when she discovers that an artist friend surreptitiously videotapes his sexual conquests). Still others will viewSex and the Cityas documentary. Regardless of your view, this groundbreaking series will have you longing for more.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005AVCB", "B000063TQT", "B00008MTVM", "B0000DC151", "B00382S9T6", "B00382S9SW", "B00382S9TQ", "B00005AVCA", "B0002SDY1W", "B0000DBJ2E", "B00005YU82", "B000068CNY", "B000CNGCAW", "B000CNGCAM"], "bought_together": ["B00005AVCB", "B000063TQT"], "also_viewed": ["B00005AVCB", "B000063TQT", "B001DDBCUA", "B002ZG98Z0", "B0011UBDTK", "B003Z8ZCG6", "B006WZIB1C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 169044}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 4.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0783117388", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SJ6990M8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sex and the City - The Complete First Season [VHS]"}
{"description": "The best way to enjoy this 1997 thriller is to forget the much better film that inspired it (1973'sThe Day of the Jackal) and get whatever kicks you can from this heavy-metal remake. It's not bad as hokey thrillers go, but all of the original film's suspenseful finesse has been traded in (not traded up) for bigger, bolder action and nonsensical plotting. It's as if Hollywood had forgotten to create excitement without resorting to overblown action and heavy hardware, but there's ample compensation in the casting of Bruce Willis and Richard Gere. Willis is the elusive assassin known only as the Jackal, whose latest target (he uses a cannon-sized gun that's anything but inconspicuous) may be the first lady of the United States. Gere plays a former IRA terrorist who is recruited by the deputy head of the FBI (Sidney Poitier) to trace the Jackal's maneuvers, and Diane Venora offers some gutsy support as a Russian-born agent who assists Gere on his mission. The movie has fun turning Willis into a master of disguise, and Gere adds much-needed gravity to counter the plot's escalating absurdity, but this is the kind of film that falls apart if you think about it too much.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000IO4G", "6304258984", "0792147618", "0783202253", "B00003CXUX", "0792133153", "6303696813", "B00003G1FZ", "6301697758", "B00004WIDB", "6301208773", "0792116887", "076781956X", "B00003JRAB", "6302945089", "B0002GTWOM", "B00007CVYA", "6305718792", "B000059XYK", "6303313345", "6300183211", "0800125762", "6302842476", "0800199421", "078322530X", "079212569X", "6304214502", "6305622825", "6303269834", "0800178394", "B00003BE3X", "B00004RVRP", "630300394X", "6303486746", "6304826133", "6304259131", "B00003CXN3", "0790748169", "6305171750", "6303447589", "630470786X", "0793927501", "630348431X", "0783222955", "B00003OSSM", "6301071379", "079213690X", "0790731274", "0790731975", "B000006FNX", "6303383300", "6303953425", "B00005A7VC", "079073799X", "0790733927", "B00005JKIO", "6305368139"], "bought_together": ["B00000IO4G"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 435268}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.25, "brand": "", "asin": "0783223218", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515MWW5PDEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Jackal  [VHS]"}

{"description": "How long will truck tires last on top of molten lava? A surprising amount of time, apparently, according to this wild and wildly improbable disaster movie. Pierce Brosnan stars as a government geologist who shows up in a small Washington town to check out an active volcano, and in doing so gets in the way of the local-development agenda of the mayor (Linda Hamilton). Mother Nature soon levels the playing field, however, quite literally, as the pair and sundry kids and others try to keep ahead of the volcano's many spin-off problems. Roger Donaldson (The Bounty) directed, and if the film is remembered for nothing else, its special effects are unnervingly realistic, no doubt drawn in part from research into the Mount St. Helens disaster.

{"description": "The second film in Oliver Stone's Vietnam trilogy moves from the brutality of war inPlatoonto its equally traumatic aftermath. Based on the memoir of combat veteran Ron Kovic, the film stars Tom Cruise as Kovic, whose gunshot wound in Vietnam left him paralyzed from the chest down. He is deeply embittered by neglect in a veteran's hospital and by the shattering of his patriotic idealism because of the horror and futility of the Vietnam conflict. While painfully and awkwardly adjusting to his disability and a changing definition of masculinity, Kovic joins the burgeoning movement of antiwar protest, culminating in a climactic appearance at the 1976 Democratic national convention. A powerfully intimate portrait that unfolds on an epic scale,Born on the Fourth of Julyis arguably Stone's best film (if you can forgive its often strident tone), and Cruise's Oscar-nominated role is uncompromising in its depiction of one man's personal anguish and political awakening.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["079284646X", "B006TTC5HC", "B0015D20FE", "B000ELL1R6", "B000B8QG22", "B000P0J09C", "B00031V21M", "B00005V9HI", "B003ELKNH2", "B004FQX59I", "B00AEBBA36", "B00AEFXR1K", "B000GAKDAG", "B00000IQC0", "B00005JN2Z", "B0018QPPXW", "B00AEBB86U", "B000065V3G", "B000035Z5G", "1888451785", "B00005PJ8T", "B00001ZWUS", "B00005B6JZ", "B0013FCWUW", "B0000YEEGM", "B000M4RG42", "B000RTB0R6", "B00AEFY0F2", "B004U7MR1Y", "0800141741", "0783226810", "B00AEBB9LO", "B000E1NXJ0", "B00005JA9F", "B00275EGWY", "B003ASLJOU", "B001TUZG4K", "B00005JNTI", "B002OGMGV4", "B000CEXEWA", "0767830555", "B0002WZTOI", "B000EHSVS2", "B00AEFXYJA", "B00B0U2SFE", "B00004RF82", "B00080ZG10", "B00005JK8K", "B004FQX5B6", "B000059TFO", "B000065U1N", "B00008G8M4", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B0000542CI", "B000O599YO", "B000G6BLHY", "B003BV8I3Q", "B00005J760", "0800141806", "B004SIP7ZS", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B00005N5S2", "B0006GAOJA", "B000P0J09M", "B001MVWFAO", "B00AEBB95K", "B000C20VPA", "B0043X1FL8", "B000U788WU", "0767817745", "B003ASLJQI", "B004SIP7TE", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B000BRP4BM", "B000FVQLQQ", "B000CNESTE", "B00005JPKE", "B0004Z33EG", "B00000K0DQ", "B000GG4Y32", "B00005JL78", "B000059HAN", "6305428522", "B004AOECXI", "B000PAAJZ6", "B001TH92N4", "B000ZM1MGE", "B00BTYJYR6", "0783225733", "B0006GANN2", "0767836359", "B00008CMRK", "B004GJYRI2", "B003HKN52U", "0800177967", "B000FVQLRA", "B00011CZRE", "B00009W5CA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["079284646X", "B00001ZWUS", "B006TTC5HC", "B000B8QG22"]}, "price": 8.48, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 263904}, "asin": "0783226764", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510WBGNCT9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Born on the Fourth of July"}
{"description": "A movie that only true horror buffs could love,Army of Darknessis officially part 3 in the wild and wacky Evil Dead trilogy masterminded by the perversely inventive director Sam Raimi, who would later serve as executive producer of the popular syndicated TV seriesHercules: The Legendary Journeys.Raimi's favorite actor, Bruce Campbell, returns as Ash (hero of the first two Evil Dead flicks), a hardware-store clerk who is magically transported--along with his beat-up Oldsmobile and a chainsaw attachment for his severed left forearm--to the brutal battlefields of the 14th century. He quickly assumes power (who else in the Middle Ages packs a shotgun and a chainsaw?), and unites his band of medieval knights against the dreaded Army of the Dead. Raimi gleefully subverts almost every horror-movie clich&eacute; as he serves up a nonstop parade of blood, gore, and vicious sword-bearing skeletons--an affectionate homage to animator Ray Harryhausen's classicJason and the Argonauts. The frantic action is fun while it lasts, but even at 80 minutesArmy of Darknessnearly wears out its welcome. You know that Raimi can maintain the mayhem for only so long before it grows tiresome, and fortunately this madcap movie quits while it's ahead.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005J9ZFQG", "B000WC3864", "B008JFUNYG", "B001KEGR5M", "B0001LQJMQ", "B003S6S7TY", "B004GGU9K0", "B000QUCQX8", "B008CYDD7I", "B005J9ZE5I", "B00C6F61IW", "B004GGU9JQ", "B00004Y87O", "B000WC38FA", "B000AQ69QS", "B0006A9FKA", "B00IF8Q0YE", "B0013D8LAE", "B000RIWAVW", "B0002C9DK4", "B000F7CMPE", "B0001611DI", "B0000AOX0F", "B002LMSWN2", "B000FS9FE4", "B0002CHK1S", "157362408X", "B000IJ7A5Q", "B002GHHHG0", "B00D7AM6M0", "B000I2J68M", "B00009MGEM", "B001NPD9LS", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B000VKL6Z2", "B004SIP6LS", "B00007AJG4", "B002JT69IW", "0790729342", "B0009OUBC4", "B00005JA8B", "B001D5C1OO", "B000V4UFZK", "B00005LC4Q", "B0056P6SOG", "B004P7CMOQ", "B000UAE7O0", "B000WC389G", "B0016MJ6P6", "B000I0RNVQ", "B008WAM2E2", "B0001US7OA", "B00005N5RM", "B00AEFY2WI", "B000FJH5MC", "B000099T3M", "B004EI2NP4", "B00005JO16", "B008G33PIM", "B001DJLD1W", "B000TSIJWY", "B001DJLD0S", "B000AXWHSA", "B000FA57UI", "B00AEFXW8I", "B00018D42W", "B000068IEV", "B000S0GYRU", "B000FA57US", "6304712499", "B001B8XRT6", "B002VWNIDG", "B002OVO18A", "B0002ABURA", "B00006FDCD", "B00AEFYDM2", "B0028DRGDQ", "B008874968", "B0000AOX09", "B001KEGR5W", "B0000VCZNE", "0312291450", "B0087ZG7UW", "B0024FAG44", "B0053TWV46", "B0058I9DZM", "B003VMFWXO", "B003WTO5NO", "B0015U0QWG", "B004XVMCH6", "B004LWZW24", "B001B1UO6W", "B005HI4LMS", "B000LP6KNU", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00317LM8S", "B0031U8OEK", "B0024FADBA", "B000C20VRS"], "bought_together": ["B005J9ZFQG", "B000WC3864"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005J9ZFQG", "B00005R24K", "B008JFUNYG", "B009JBWOU0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22777}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.74, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "0783227434", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DQ0H428VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Army of Darkness"}

{"description": "Derivative fluff from 1987, made tolerable by its bawdy exuberance and an appealing performance by Michael J. Fox, who was still enjoying TV stardom and the career momentum he earned by travelingBack to the Future. Here he plays a Kansas farm boy who dreams of scoring big in New York City, but reality turns out to be brutal to his ambition. When his uncle (Richard Jordan) gives him a mail-room job in the high-rise headquarters of a major corporation, Fox occupies an empty office and poses as a young executive, winning the attention of a lovely young colleague (Helen Slater) and having an affair with his boss's wife (Margaret Whitton). Sporadically amusing as a yuppie comedy and rather off-putting as a wannabe sex farce, the movie's still recommendable for its lively cast and a breezy style that almost succeeds in updating the conventions of vintage screwball comedy. Whitton is a standout performer here, so you may wonder why her comedic talent has been underrated, apart from a good role in the first twoMajor Leaguemovies. This may be little more than a big-screen sitcom, but it's not without its charms.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305133468", "B00009AOBH", "B0007IO6NM", "0783230354", "B0012RWQJ8", "B00013WWT8", "B000065V3H", "B0000A14TA", "B00AEBB9DW", "6305213283", "B000065U1Q", "B00015YVD6", "6305428050", "B0001IN0S0", "B00005R5G9", "B005QX8UEE", "B002O3Z4YI", "B00D2UMHVK", "6305236569", "B000063UR3", "B0015RRN9S", "B001ECDVK4", "B00441GYQ0", "B00005T7I0", "B000F6ZIIS", "0783230060", "B001AEF6C2", "B000E6ESI0", "B000FO0A9W", "B00AEBB99Q", "0783226896", "B002XUBDRY", "B000FO0AA6", "B001Q8MMD8", "B00009PY3X", "B000068TPB", "6305428395", "B0043X1FLI", "B00AEFYW64", "B00ALTQRRK", "B001ECDVJU", "B00AEBB9E6", "B000035Z5H", "B000068MC0", "0792844866", "0783225504", "B000Y11B7Q", "B00009AOBM", "B00081U7HC", "B0002B15X8", "B0000A98ZO", "B00009AOBK", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00E1HIXFW", "B000F6ZIII", "B000059TGG", "B0000542C9", "B000065V3L", "B0001GOH84", "B0045HCJRG", "B00DJYKD0G", "B002GHHHP6", "B0001EFTSS", "B00AG475K8", "B0000648ZQ", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B00005U5A8", "B00020HB4Q", "B0053TWVR8", "B005FQ2H8W", "B00005V5NS", "B00441GYZG", "B000065V3E", "B000CEV3M8", "B003IQ5YZE", "078322740X", "B0038Z5T4Q", "B000PMFRYC", "B00008G8M4", "B002GHHHNI", "B001LXIDVI", "B0006GANOQ", "B0001GOH7U", "B001Q8MMCE", "B000N60H9U", "B001LXIDW2", "B00AEFXXMI", "B0015NORDW", "B00005N5SB", "B0043X1FOU", "B005OK0YVG", "B0045HCIYU", "6304711891", "B00070FX5U", "B00K31RBYY", "B00803PFXG", "B00AEBB9WI", "B000SFOW8I", "B00AEFXYJA", "B00026ZG10"], "bought_together": ["6305133468"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000N60H9U", "6305133468", "B00319ECII", "6305236569"]}, "price": 6.66, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 11839}, "asin": "0783229364", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515B421EWKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Secret of My Success"}
{"description": "Ray Peterson (Tom Hanks) would like nothing better than to spend a quiet week's vacation in his suburban home, drinking beer and watching TV. But, spurred on by his two friends' spinning of boyish paranoid fantasies about their reclusive neighbors, the Klopeks, the usually down-to-earth Ray begins to suspect his idyllic neighborhood has been invaded by an evil force, to the point where he and his friends become psychotically nosey. You see where this is going, and you see it from a mile off.  Only the general surface-thin plot is somewhat offset by director Joe Dante's fine sense of the absurd, and a host of engagingly played neighbor-types, namely Rick Ducommun as Ray's best friend who's always proposing bad ideas, and Bruce Dern as a sometimes wild-eyed ex-vet who'd love some action.  Dante and crew seem to have a knack for keeping these broad characterizations light enough that you don't mind their superficiality. But the best jokes in this unprepossessing film come from composer Jerry Goldsmith's score; Bruce Dern's presence, for instance, is announced by the theme fromPatton, and the boys' first approach to the Klopeks' for a meet-and-greet is buttressed by classic strains from Sergio Leone spaghetti Westerns.  Kudos to the Klopeks, for their evil ways are ably embodied by Henry Gibson, Courtney Gains, and Brother Theodore.  In particular, any suburb that finds it's inhabited by the likes of Brother Theodore is in dire need of new zoning laws.  But Carrie Fisher's role as Ray's amiably long-suffering wife is thankless, and she deserves better.--Jim Gay", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005T7HZ", "B00005Y71F", "6305162018", "B00007GZQZ", "0783227884", "B00004RJ73", "B0002B15X8", "0790740044", "B00AEBB9E6", "B000065V3P", "0783227388", "B005QX8UEE", "B000P0J09W", "B0000648ZQ", "B001AEF6C2", "B00008G8LM", "B00441GYQ0", "6305236569", "B000ATQYWY", "6304698607", "B000YGDNPO", "B005LL817W", "B002O3Z4YI", "B0033PSHBI", "B008R65XKQ", "B0009ML1Z2", "B00005JKFA", "B000VBIGD6", "B0001AW14C", "B000BUE5E6", "B0088EDONK", "0767821467", "B0009RCPY8", "0790732157", "B000FO0AA6", "B00000IQC4", "0783232047", "B0087ZG7PW", "B00028HBES", "B0001I55UQ", "0783231644", "B00287Z18Y", "B00005QT9P", "B0000C3I99", "B000FO0A9W", "B000QUCQX8", "B00E1HIX66", "B0001I562I", "B00158K0QU", "B00005A8XX", "B0024FADAQ", "0783225733", "B00AEBB9DW", "0783225482", "B00D2UMHVK", "B000PMFS0A", "B0001ZX0O2", "B0087ZG7HK", "B00AENNHOE", "B00005T7I1", "B007STBUHI", "B00004TJQK", "B00GOT15IM", "B00D3LA6RK", "6305428042", "B00005JOJE", "B00008977A", "B002XUBDRY", "B00FAI3JE6", "B00AEFXPG2", "B0001EFTSS", "B000NJMJGG", "B0045HCJRG", "B00009VU01", "B00015YVD6", "B00C0E9LMW", "B000YDBPAM", "B0055CMM0O", "B000E6ESI0", "B005XB8SLE", "B000P0J0A6", "6305428050", "B0045HCJ7G", "B00008WFU4"], "bought_together": ["B00005T7HZ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000K7VHTQ", "B001O3M36Q", "B000P0J09W", "B00004RJ73"]}, "price": 10.28, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3520}, "asin": "0783233515", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G8BRQVWYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The 'Burbs"}
{"description": "The original 1960 version ofVillage of the Damnedis regarded as a classic of science-fiction and horror, and it remains one of the creepiest movies of its kind. Directed with occasional flair by John Carpenter, this 1995 remake trades subtlety for more explicit chills and violence, but the basic premise remains effectively eerie. In the tiny, idyllic town of Midwich, a strange mist causes the entire population to fall asleep, and when everyone awakes the town physician (Christopher Reeve) discovers that 10 women--including his wife and a local teenaged virgin--have mysteriously become pregnant. Their children are all born on the same day, with matching white hair and strange, glowing eyes, growing at an accelerated rate and raising Reeve's suspicion that they're not of Earthly origin. These demonic brats can control minds and wreak havoc with the power of their thoughts--so of course, they must be destroyed! Only Reeve knows how to get the job done, and his performance (the actor's last big-screen role before his paralyzing accident in 1995) grounds this otherwise superfluous remake with enough credibility to hold the viewer's attention. But for the real chills, definitely check out the original version--it's 20 minutes shorter but twice as spooky.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00027JYMG", "B0000AOX0A", "B00EALTVPA", "B0053TWVDC", "B0052DP1TA", "6305258287", "B005CFBZVG", "B00009PY4G", "B00D7AM5XU", "B000TUDBFC", "B0000AOX0F", "B00EALTWJ0", "B00AEFYDM2", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B00HW3EJ6Y", "B0002O7XW2", "B00DBNLAZW", "B00005N5RM", "B0052XU4BK", "B00A1AU72A", "B0009X76XC", "B00K1L4NBU", "B00IYJRIKO", "B000HCO86I", "B000AM6OQ2", "B000HEWEGC", "B00009PY2T", "B00AEBB91O", "B007XF0W3K", "B000G1ALDY", "B0001FVDQ4", "B00AEFYUW0", "B001B8XRT6", "B00EF0NY7W", "B00GHH9GSC", "B00004TS0G", "B000FFJZO2", "B004P7CMHI", "0790742462", "B00004Y87O", "B0026ICAOS", "B00CPTUNUG", "B00027JYNK", "B008SGMPVU", "B00008974J", "B004P7CN7W", "B0000AOX09", "B009IV2Z3M", "B00009NHC7", "B008874968", "1573624101", "B00C7E3EFU", "B001P3SAAI", "B003JFCG82", "B004XVMCN0", "B00GHH9IIA", "B008VF0Y0M", "B000V4UFZK", "B0002IQLH6", "B00003CY6P", "B00BW4S87U", "B00IQHPS6A", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00C2CDJ34", "B00096S48U", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B0002V7OI8", "B0024FADD8", "078062856X", "B000FGFBUS", "B00D7AM698", "B001AQMBNC", "B000TSIJWY", "B00000IQC4", "0783116926", "B00DOB3N56", "B0053TWV46", "B000RXVNDI", "B00005JOJE", "B00AGKH4MG", "B00KMAVPW0", "B00006FDCD", "B00AEBB91E", "B00BCMSY80", "B00003CWRF", "B00JJOY47I", "B00A429Y56", "B00D97DMBU", "B001ECDVKE", "B00079Z9WI", "B002NZK5SM", "B00004W3HF", "B005CFBZQ6", "B00ARWX9NG", "B0000AOX0E", "B002AS45VK", "B004BLJQOK", "B00HF00RJW", "B00D7AM5U8", "B000063UR0"], "bought_together": ["B00027JYMG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00027JYMG", "B0024FADBA", "B000AM6OQ2", "B0000AOX0F"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 44546}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.5, "brand": "Universal", "asin": "0783230427", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XFND15HNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Village of the Damned"}

{"description": "Unlike most \"message\" films which date themselves almost immediately, Lewis Milestone's low-key unpolished and deeply-felt screen adaptation of the Erich Maria Remarque anti-war novel has lost little of its original impact. Years after its release it was still being banned in countries mobilizing for war. The plot follows a group of young German recruits in World War I through their passage from idealism to disillusionment. As the central character Paul Baumer (Lew Ayres) declares, \"We live in the trenches and we fight. We try not to be killed - that's all\". All Quiet is an anthology of now famous scenes: Ayres trapped in a shell crater with a man he has killed; the first meeting of the recruits and the veterans; infantrymen being mowed down to machine-gun visual rhythms; a moonlight swim with French farmgirls; Ayres' pacifist speech to his astonished schoolmates; and the final shot of the soldier's hand reaching for a fatal butterfly.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792841409", "B00AEFZDNA", "B000BYA4HE", "B00BTYJYR6", "B0009S4IKQ", "B00004TVUD", "B0006HBV3W", "B0000639EU", "B00005U8F4", "B00012FXJ0", "B00D9BNONW", "B00006RCO2", "B00011D1OK", "B0011FDVGI", "B00AATV07S", "B004HHX9XC", "B0000549B1", "B004SJVQ4I", "0780020707", "B00D3K357O", "B00004XPPC", "B00006RCO3", "B000BITV92", "0449213943", "B0002MHE1O", "B000HWZ4CA", "B0006GANN2", "B001GUYAZY", "B00011D1OU", "B00AEFY6DI", "B001DW2BIS", "B0046YK4KW", "B00006RCO1", "B000EHSVS2", "0792833287", "B000I6BJ56", "079284646X", "0767802470", "B000KX0IOA", "B001GLX6TY", "B0087ZG7OI", "B00AEBB9QY", "B000KJTGHO", "B00005J75F", "0764586718", "0780021312", "B00006ADD5", "B002VWNIAY", "B006TTC5HC", "B0009KNR42", "0792839730", "B00005PJ8S", "B00005JKF6", "6305918880", "B004VK74A4", "B0042FDCR2", "B005SQ3AO4", "B000LPR6GA", "B00049QQJQ", "B000XJD34I", "B00005AUKB", "B0000DJZ8R", "B00003CXBU", "B00008AOTN", "B00005PJ8T", "B0010AN7Z4", "B003ZEQMH8", "B0045HCJQM", "B0049985XW", "B0002V7ON8", "6304907729", "B00005AUKE", "B000M2E30O", "0143039040", "B000055Y0X", "B000LAZE8C", "B0050FXDDQ", "B001EOQCMG", "B0024FADBU", "B0001US8F8", "B0045HCJ8U", "B000FVQLRA", "B000BYA4II", "B001BEK8E2", "0792841662", "6305999872", "B0007OY2OY", "B00005N5S3", "B0040QYROA", "B001E18222", "B000O78L0U", "B00782O7IY", "B0000BWVCR", "B000MTEFWS", "B00B7U2GCC", "B00BY0EBK0", "B0010YSD7W", "B0045HCJJY", "B000O599NA", "B000EOTUSA"], "bought_together": ["0792841409", "B00BTYJYR6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000639EU", "B00D9BNONW", "0792841409", "0449213943"]}, "price": 15.94, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 210011}, "asin": "0783230435", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41XEDT59ZJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "All Quiet on the Western Front"}
{"description": "Wes Craven's horror pictures always have a few wild ideas knocking  around inside them, and this 1989 slashfest is no exception. The electrocution of a mass murderer turns into a kind of cosmic jump-start:  evil Horace Pinker is reborn as an elusive electronic phantom, capable of leaping from one body to another. (This trick is also used to good effect inThe HiddenandFallen.) Pinker's a stinker, and Craven was clearly trying to set up another franchise villain in the vein of hisNightmare on Elm Streetchamp, Freddy Krueger--perhaps a bit too baldly. However, amidst the mayhem, the film's real subject is the poisonous presence of mass media, as Pinker (played byThe X-Files' Mitch Pileggi)  insinuates himself as a free-floating spirit run amok in television itself. In its own pulp way,Shockergets at the heart of media-culture inanity quicker than a ten-week college class on the subject, and although Craven occasionally lapses into generic bloodletting, he always snaps right back with some crazy angle on the TV nation. The hero is played by a young Peter Berg, theChicago Hopestar who would go on to direct his own shocker,Very Bad Things.Shockerfailed to catch on with audiences (somewhere there's a warehouse full of unsold Horace Pinker action figures), but it's definitely worth a look for horror fans.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005N5RM", "B000008KNW", "B003THSXJ6", "B0016MJ6P6", "B000TUDFDU", "B0002VYOVS", "B000099T3M", "B00009PY4C", "B000TUDBFM", "B00K1L4NBU", "B00E5S2HGS", "B00BTYPW7C", "B000096FVG", "B000IJ7A5Q", "0767817664", "B0053TWW9K", "B0000CEB6Y", "B00A429Y56", "B00CERJI5U", "B00JU94ZPS", "B0085Z3ADQ", "B005FRWU5Q", "B000TUDBFW", "B00AEFYXQI", "B001B8XRT6", "B0001US7OA", "B00D97DMBU", "B00BCMSY80", "B000I2J68M", "B00005O5B5", "B005OT810I", "B0053TWW36", "B0053TWVA0", "B0002DB5PO", "B009IV2Z3M", "B00D7AM5XU", "B0000AOX0D", "B00IA1VKVY", "B0000AOX0A", "B00ETHN9L2", "B00AEFY2WI", "B005S2F8LQ", "B0002S9QUA", "B008DVJOQ4", "B008R9GVHM", "B00DOZNGTK", "B00HRUQ8X4", "B00CPTUNVA", "B00CPTUNZG", "B00005JP3R", "B003PIUINI", "B00AEBB91E", "B00HRUQ9W4", "B00018D42W", "B00EF0NY7W", "0792839706", "B00HRUQB8Q", "B000MV8AC2", "B0002T7YNA", "B00AEFYDGI", "B00006FDCD", "B00JHH1VSW", "B002HML6YI", "B0001ZX0GK", "6305841985", "B008VF0Y0M", "B00AEFY2LO", "B0002KQNL8", "B00DBNLAZW", "630512003X", "B000092T4C", "B00JQYV0B4", "B00EVIOWUG", "B000069I05", "B00317LM9W", "B0091G7BTM", "B000A7Q1UQ", "B00K31RC20", "B00GSTHD1G", "B00EVU3RSW", "B002I41KNC", "B00EALTVPA", "B004AC6PMG", "B005LS4MQY", "B00GSMZ3I8", "B0000ALPFL", "6304604572", "B00A429Y9M", "6305976422", "B000S0GYRU", "B00AEFY31S", "B007NPUWDA", "B00GJ7CUFG", "B005CFBZWK", "B00AEFY37C", "B00GHH9GSC", "B001QMCJ00", "B001B1UO6W", "B00CERJIH8"], "bought_together": ["B003THSXJ6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000N4RAQU", "B0024FADB0", "B000008KNW", "B00EALTVAA"]}, "price": 9.26, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 59173}, "asin": "0783232101", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515ZNK3KNJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Shocker"}

{"description": "First, a few facts.  Dolph Lundgren expresses emotions ranging from  stoic to, well, really stoic.  There are holes in the story large enough to pilot theExxon Valdezthrough without spilling a drop.  And the film is littered with action movie clich&eacute;s.  But none of this matters.The Punishersucceeds because it stays true to its origins, the Marvel comic of the same name.  Studio-engineered films such asBatmannever quite capture the mixture of loyalty and betrayal, justice and revenge, moral ambiguity and emotional truth that are the hallmarks of the graphic novel. Films such asDarkmando.  So doesThe Punisher.  Lundgren plays Frank Castle, a dedicated policeman whose family was wiped out in a mob hit. He went underground (literally) and, as the Punisher, has been exacting his revenge, killing 125 mobsters in the past five years.  But when the yakuza (Japanese Mafia) moves in on the mob's territory and kidnaps their children, it's up to the Punisher to rescue the kids.  The action blazes, Lundgren (a former full-contact karate champ) moves with feral grace, the production design is a pleasure to watch, and director Mark Goldblatt (whose credits as editor include such big films asStarship TroopersandTrue Lies) has a clean, efficient style.--Geof Miller", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001QB9H1U", "B0002IQMAM", "B0009A409S", "B00BCMT49I", "B005G5NPD8", "B001QB9H2E", "B003VQO4WU", "B002GHHHOM", "B004O0TZ6M", "B000EWBKKS", "B005HIBWUW", "B0002S94CK", "B005E7SF7E", "6305161992", "B000YPUFB0", "B001MWUWU8", "B000LC4Z7Q", "B0007P0Y7C", "B00CPTUNZG", "B004P7CMIM", "B0000959N0", "B0006L0LOS", "B00BTYMPUY", "B000PFUAP0", "B00A4TMLNG", "B003G5K7RW", "B00005PJ8Q", "B0085Z3ABI", "B00005OKQH", "B005LAIGW8", "B001CDR1FG", "B003Q7B7BU", "1558908846", "B000ION23U", "B0011367SY", "6305428018", "B000OVLBF8", "B001CC7PKS", "B00EJRZ5X2", "B0038Z5T32", "B00A34LX9A", "B004EXWGJW", "B001RHGRT8", "B002IRYYPU", "B00JU94ZPS", "B007PZ6T80", "B00388PK88", "B000CQ98FA", "B00067AVSS", "B00006RJ59", "B001RKTMN8", "B0000203YZ", "B001GZJTIW", "B000OVLBIU", "B003YOZNBU", "B00009ATIM", "B000065U1G", "B005LAIGWS", "B001M9ELQC", "6304712499", "B002U6CJCO", "B00005U14J", "B0001Z37HM", "B0045HCJG2", "B00006RCOC", "B00IZZDWKM", "B0002A2VLY", "B002GSXKNI", "B00005N89J", "B00DN3U72W", "B00JL6L4WC", "B00595W3Q0", "B009YQJ322", "B00J5LXTUI", "B004CQZFEE", "B00AEFYDM2", "B007ZXW3NC", "6304779631", "B004CJQVP8", "B000HT38HQ", "0783228465", "B00003ETM8", "B00HMOW9YM", "B00JJOY45U", "B00AEFYDGI", "B001AK3S4Y", "B0029WGIDK", "B003O7I6L6", "B0089A9VJE", "B0018BDDFE", "B0007V6ITE", "B003SLEDL0", "B0038Z5SEM", "B000Q66PX4", "B000AYEL38", "B00J6245M2", "B000VI70QS", "B002Q9MZGU", "B004EPZ07K", "B0090SI582"], "bought_together": ["B0002IQMAM", "B001QB9H1U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000I2KRZI", "B001QB9H1U", "B00005JLXE", "B0007P0Y7C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22818}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.42, "brand": "Artisan Entertainment", "asin": "078401132X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PT0F2CW8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Punisher"}

{"description": "Peter Panhas a special place in the realm of classic animated  Disney films: it instills an element of childlike wonder. The 1953 version of James M. Barrie's story is colorfully told and keeps on the straight and narrow of the book. Barrie's wondrous focus on child's play is the key to its longevity: kids who don't grow up, shadows that run away from their owners, pirates, a fairy, and the magic ability to fly. In short, you can't help wishing the adventure would happen to you. Fueled by a few memorable songs (the stunner being \"You Can Fly\") and the strong impression of the pixie fairy Tinkerbell and the goofy Captain Hook, Disney's version of this story neither supplants nor lessens the Broadway version with Mary Martin that was produced for television the same decade.

Arnold plays an &quot;eraser&quot; from the Federal Witness Protection Program, so named because he can virtually erase the existence of anyone he's been assigned to protect. His latest beneficiary is an FBI employee (Vanessa Williams) who stumbled across a secret government group involved in the sale and export of an advanced weapon capable of shooting rounds at nearly the speed of light.

{"description": "When Prince's dazzling and dynamicPurple Rain(movie and soundtrack album) and the hypnotic hit single &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; exploded onto the pop-culture scene in 1984, it seemed there was nothing the purple one couldn't do. The film is basically a feature-length music video, but no musician has ever had a better big-screen showcase for his many talents.  The plot is really just a theme (about the son of an abusive father struggling not to continue the pattern) upon which to hang some of Prince's most dazzling songs (including &quot;Let's Go Crazy&quot; and the title tune), and some sizzling live-concert numbers.  Apollonia Kotero is ravishing as the romantic interest, and Morris Day and the Time provide some terrific musical competition.Purple Rainis an essential artifact of the mid-'80s pop Zeitgeist.

{"description": "EDITOR'S NOTE: According to a Warner Home Video technician involved in  the production ofThe Stanley Kubrick Collection, Kubrick authorized all aspects of theCollection, from the use of Digital Component Video (or \"D-1\") masters originally approved in 1989, to the use of minimalist screen menus, chapter stops, and (in the case of2001: A Space OdysseyandThe Shiningon DVD) supplementary materials. Full-screen presentation ofThe ShiningandFull Metal Jacketwas also approved by Kubrick, who recomposed his original framing,  reportedly believing that those films looked best on video in the full-screen format. (In fact, the original theatrical aspect ratio ofThe Shiningwas 1.66:1, meaning that a relatively small portion of the image is lost.) Kubrick also chose mono over stereo,  believing that inconsistencies in theatrical sound systems resulted in loss of control over theatrical presentation. In every respect, the Warner spokesman  said, the films in theCollectionremain as Kubrick approved them. Any future attempt to remaster or alter them would  have to be approved by an appointee of the Kubrick estate.", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301115430", "6300214826", "630018627X", "6304935811", "6301979761", "B00006C7G9", "B00000J2L7", "0784011923", "0790748169", "630407185X", "0800132009", "6302816580", "6301208773", "B00000JGEI", "B000BT8VVK", "B00000IO4G", "630018224X", "0792133153", "6300248135", "6302054982", "630300394X", "B00000K3AN", "6303696813", "6303020089", "6302415853", "6304826133", "6303029027", "0783235607", "6304259131", "B000065JH1", "0800179552", "6301217977", "B00007CVYA", "0800116917", "B0000CDL3W", "6304214502", "6302935148", "6304414099", "6303168507", "076783819X", "6300248089", "0800125762", "630018403X", "6300213005", "6303269834", "6303109950", "6300246965", "B00006IUOZ", "6300183211", "6304925131", "0783202253", "0783107986", "079213690X", "B000005XXG", "B00000FZCU", "0800187873", "6300214540"], "bought_together": ["6301115430", "6300214826"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 348239}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0790701251", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZM1C6TC7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Full Metal Jacket [VHS]"}

{"description": "Mel Gibson's Oscar-winning 1995Braveheartis an impassioned epic about William Wallace, the 13th-century Scottish leader of a popular revolt against England's tyrannical Edward I (Patrick McGoohan). Gibson cannily plays Wallace as a man trying to stay out of history's way until events force his hand, an attribute that instantly resonates with several of the actor's best-known roles, especiallyMad Max. The subsequent camaraderie and courage Wallace shares in the field with fellow warriors is pure enough and inspiring enough to bring envy to a viewer, and even as things go wrong for Wallace in the second half, the film does not easily cave in to a somber tone. One of the most impressive elements is the originality with which Gibson films battle scenes, featuring hundreds of extras wielding medieval weapons. After Eisenstein'sAlexander Nevsky, Orson Welles'sChimes at Midnight, and even Kenneth Branagh'sHenry V, you might think there is little new that could be done in creating scenes of ancient combat; yet Gibson does it.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004XPQ6", "B00003CXE6", "6303953425", "6304935811", "B0001VL30O", "B000054OW2", "6302415853", "0790741512", "6304071876", "6301792734", "6303168507", "6303942830", "0800125762", "6300183211", "B000007OY0", "B000056BRF", "6300214540", "B000065U6Q", "B00004WIDB", "B00003CXTF", "B00007KK15", "079070546X", "B0000A36J1", "B00000K3AN", "6302482712", "6300263673", "6305169187", "0788811355", "B00003BE3X", "0800116917", "6304414099", "6303020089", "0792133153", "0790744589", "6302909023", "0800132009", "079212569X", "6300185095", "6303313345", "0767819462", "6304259131", "B00000K2SC", "0800199421", "B0001DI5W6", "B00005JLTM", "630018224X", "0790701251", "6304151306", "6303696813", "0790731274", "0792147618", "B00005RIJ3", "6301586026", "6302945089", "0783223218", "6305718792"], "bought_together": ["B00004XPQ6", "B00003CXE6"], "also_viewed": ["0792151712", "6303314015", "6301966988", "6303402348", "B00004WIDB", "0792116887", "6300213668", "0800125762", "B00004XPQ6", "0792842111", "B00003CXTF", "0788812408", "6302526574", "6303215734", "0788806270", "6300183211", "B00004U8P4", "0788802194"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 521725}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.5, "brand": "", "asin": "0792139771", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PF2QYK62L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Braveheart (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "The only remaining evidence that Sylvester Stallone might have had a respectable career, this 1976 Oscar winner (for Best Picture, Director, and Editing) is still the quintessential ode to an underdog and one of the best boxing movies ever made. After writing the script about a two-bit boxer who gets a &quot;million-to-one shot&quot; against the world heavyweight champion, Stallone insisted that he star in the title role, and his equally unknown status helped to catapult him (and this rousing film) to overnight success. The story is familiar, but it has been handled with such vitality and emotional honesty that you can't help but leap and cheer for Rocky Balboa, the chump turned champ (despite his valiant defeat in the ring) who stuns the boxing world with the support of his timid girlfriend, Adrian (Talia Shire), and grizzled trainer, Gus (Burgess Meredith).

{"description": "A man calling himself Henry Faber is actually \"the Needle,\" a German spy in England bearing critical information on Allied invasion plans that he must deliver personally to the Fhrer. He's so named because of his preferred method of assassination, the stiletto. He is a coldly calculating sociopath, emotionlessly focused on the task at hand, whether the task is to signal a U-boat or to gut a witness to avoid exposure.\n\nOn his way back to Germany, a fierce storm strands him on Storm Island, occupied only by a woman named Lucy (Kate Nelligan), her disabled husband, their son, and their shepherd, Tom. A romance develops between the woman and the spy, due to an estrangement of affections between Lucy and her husband, whose accident has rendered him emotionally crippled as well.\n\nThe love affair suggests there's a sympathetic personality buried somewhere inside the Nazi spy, though he remains enigmatic. Early on, we discover that he may not enjoy the hand life has dealt him. When a courier asks him about the way he lives, and \"What else can one do?\" the Needle answers, \"One can just stop.\"\n\nLucy realizes that her lover has been lying after she discovers her husband's dead body. \"The Needle\" must get to Tom's radio in time to report to his superiors the exact location of the D-Day invasion. Lucy is the Allies' last chance. He is reluctant to harm her, but she has no such qualms and shoots him as he tries to escape in a boat. Additional footage tells of Faber's activities four years before and of David's accident, while another ending finds Lucy receiving help from British Intelligence.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005QCVP", "6303057225", "B0000040EJ", "0783240171", "6302529441", "6302700949", "6302909023", "6302238331", "6302413435", "0790743213", "0800132009", "0792837096", "6300181340", "0790733463", "6301971809", "630150528X", "6300215741", "6300185168", "6302717736", "6302529484", "6302779782", "6300216748", "630280051X", "6303451535", "6303168507", "0783221347", "079074886X", "B00024I2TK", "079284517X", "6303082866", "0783235623", "B00008R9K9"], "bought_together": ["B00005QCVP"], "also_viewed": ["B0039A9M7K", "B004CQZF8U", "0451204530", "0451215710", "0062020889", "0525953094"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 312020}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.91, "brand": "", "asin": "0792835050", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516X8HB6Y7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Eye of the Needle [VHS]"}

Former infantryman Bennet Marco (Sinatra) is haunted by nightmares about his platoon having been captured and brainwashed in Korea. The indecipherable dreams seem to center on Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey), a decorated war hero but a cold fish of a man whose own mother (Angela Lansbury, in one of the all-time great dragon-lady roles) describes him as looking like his head is &quot;always about to come to a point.&quot; Mrs. Bates has nothing on Lansbury's character, the manipulative queen behind her second husband, Senator John Iselin (James Gregory), a notoriously McCarthyesque demagogue.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006210ZG", "B000055Y0X", "B00004XPPE", "B004UOHNAC", "B000CEXEWA", "B00004RF83", "B003O7I6SE", "B00143XE00", "B0050FXDDQ", "B0007TKNGK", "B00F4GGAVI", "B0010YSD7W", "B00CUKTHES", "B000CNESU8", "B00441GYYC", "B00AEFXN9G", "B0087ZG7OI", "B00871C09S", "B00K6D1QV8", "B000BITV92", "B002VWNIAY", "B003ZEQMH8", "B0045HCJ9E", "B003B3O5FY", "B00824FK9W", "0783226853", "B000PKG6OE", "B0000AMRUP", "B000OHBCI8", "B00005M2CO", "B001TITGCA", "6305999872", "B001GLX6UI", "B00005JKF6", "B00005J760", "B00AEBB89C", "B00079Z9VO", "B003ELKNH2", "B007Y1NNAW", "B0006GANN2", "B001EOQCJE", "B00005K3NV", "B000OT6V0K", "B00178T122", "6304696507", "B00004XPPC", "B0049985XW", "B001PYD0PC", "B00065GX64", "B00003CXBZ", "B006FE83UE", "B0087ZG7R0", "B0010AN7Z4", "B00005JKGX", "B0002HOEQ2", "B00004TJKI", "6305416222", "B00005A8TX", "B00005V9HH", "B0001XAOBG", "0792841409", "0780622561", "B000022TSY", "B001LXIDUO", "B00008OM23", "B005H8G78O", "B000056HED", "B00AEBB9EG", "B0007TKNM4", "B000EHSVNW", "B00AEFYL6K", "B001D8W7EU", "B000CCW2SY", "0767830555", "0792843649", "B000CNESN0", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B00006RCO1", "B00003CXBU", "B00004RG62", "B001D8W7EK", "0792838408", "B000PMFRVU", "B002GSXKQA", "B0006B2A42", "0783227973", "B00008K76U", "B006TTC5HC", "B00004TX2E", "B000ECX0QU", "B00009YXHG", "B000E1NXJ0", "B00AATV07S", "B001FZQOW2", "B00004TS0G", "B000025RE7", "B00005AUK9", "B00004W229", "B009AMANBA", "B0000DI87S"], "bought_together": ["B0006210ZG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0006210ZG", "B002M9WW4Y", "B00004XPPE", "B00KSQ0N44"]}, "price": 27.49, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 143593}, "asin": "0792838289", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514GE8H825L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Manchurian Candidate"}

That's not really a compliment, sinceLifeforceisn't much of a movie when all the sound and fury is over. But you've got to admit there's something crazily admirable about a movie that starts out as a science fiction adventure about a mission to explore Halley's comet, turns into an alien-invasion thriller featuring a beautiful naked woman (Mathilda May) who's a vampire from space, and escalates into an end-of-the-world disaster flick! It's got everything you could want from a horror movie--from zombies running amok in London to rotting corpses and energy bolts to signal the apocalypse to come!

{"description": "One of the most critically acclaimed films of 1995, this wrenchingly sad but extraordinarily moving drama provides an authentic, superbly acted portrait of two people whose lives intersect just as they've reached their lowest depths of despair. Ben (Nicolas Cage, in an Oscar-winning performance) is a former movie executive who's lost his wife and family in a sea of alcoholic self-destruction. He's come to Las Vegas literally to drink himself to death, and that's when he meets Sera (Elisabeth Shue), a prostitute who falls in love with him--and he with her--despite their mutual dead-end existence. They accept each other as they are, with no attempts by one to change the other, and this unconditional love turnsLeaving Las Vegasinto a somber yet quietly beautiful love story. Earning Oscar nominations for Best Director (Mike Figgis), Best Adapted Screenplay (Figgis, from John O'Brien's novel) and Best Actress (Shue), the film may strike some as relentlessly bleak and glacially paced, but attentive viewers will readily discover the richness of these tragic characters and the exceptional performances that bring them to life. (In a sad echo of his own fiction, novelist John O'Brien committed suicide while this film was in production.)

{"description": "MGM's bold idea to remake George Cukor's Oscar-winning upperclass romantic farce,The Philadelphia Story, into a star-studded, Technicolor musical with Cole Porter tunes somehow works splendidly and remains an underrated gem. Even the plot and character names--and some bits of dialogue--all remain the same as the original. Crooning Bing Crosby replaces Cary Grant as the wealthy ex-husband trying to win back his soon-to-be-remarried ex-wife, spoiled ice queen Tracy Lord (Grace Kelly, stunning and aloof in her last film role, originated in the earlier comedy by Katherine Hepburn). Unlike Grant, however, Crosby has jazz great Louis Armstrong, playing himself, in his corner for quixotic persuasion. Frank Sinatra (cocky in James Stewart's former role) and Celeste Holm add support as the nosy reporters covering, and subsequently complicating, the upcoming wedding. Sure,High Societylacks the original's witty satire, sarcasm, and character complexity; but it's assuredly paced and wonderfully acted, and contains enough romantic chemistry to keep the plot engaging. And then there's the music. Unlike the grandiose production numbers of many '40s and '50s musicals,High Society's musical sequences are considerably low-key and intimate, focusing on Porter's lyrical content, and the style in which it's delivered by the charismatic performers. Armstrong kicks the film off in telling style: he sings the title track, a calypso tune outlining the plot like a Greek chorus, not as an elaborately choreographed song-and-dance number, but instead stuffed claustrophobically in the back of a limousine with his jazz band. Other musical standouts include Sinatra and Crosby playfully tossing barbs during \"Well, Did You Evah?\"; Crosby and Armstrong teaming up for an energetic clash of styles in \"Now You Has Jazz\"; the two soaring, archetypal ballads by the leads--Crosby's \"I Love You, Samantha\" and Sinatra's superior \"You're Sensational\"; and, finally, the satirical Sinatra/Holm duet, \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?,\" the closestHigh Societyever comes to social or class commentary.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302363292", "0792840836", "0792840844", "0792837630", "6300215660", "6303494390", "B00004RV8M", "6300183513", "6300215741", "6303444202", "630197736X", "6300183580", "6305282927", "B0000040EO", "0783221347", "630150528X", "155880997X", "0782006809", "6301586026", "B00000F6D1", "B00004TRD5", "630233683X", "0782006779", "6302227127", "0790744759", "0792839846", "6301670140", "6302484391", "6300215695", "6303209890", "0792840860", "6300181529", "B00005LMA7", "6303394019", "B000056BRF", "6301278410", "B000EW1RBA", "0800100832", "6300251152", "6301964012", "0782008348", "630266232X", "1558807780", "0783235593", "6303333079", "630290899X", "B00003OSTO"], "bought_together": ["6302363292", "0792840844"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 285126}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0792837649", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DXMQJX2DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "High Society [VHS]"}
{"description": "This terrific Walter Hill Western follows the careers of the James and Younger brothers--and uses the nifty idea of casting actual clans of acting siblings in the roles. Thus, the James brothers are played by James and Stacy Keach; the Youngers by David, Keith, and Robert Carradine; the Millers by Randy and Dennis Quaid; and the Fords by Christopher and Nicholas Guest. Hill, working with an evocative Ry Cooder score, creates a film that is at once breathtakingly exciting and elegiac in its treatment of these post-Civil War outlaws. The Keaches in particular bring a surprising dignity to the roles of Frank and Jesse James, while David Carradine is a hoot as Cole Younger--and the Quaids mimic real life (as it was for them then) in their battles as the Miller brothers. Bloody, to be sure, but also bloody good.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303314015"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 438356}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.94, "brand": "", "asin": "079283920X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RPKGWZSDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Long Riders [VHS]"}
{"description": "Safe in their picturesque chateau behind the front lines, the French general staff passes down a direct order to Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas): take the Ant Hill at any cost. A blatant suicide mission, the attack is doomed to failure. Covering up their fatal blunder, the generals order the arrest of three innocent soldiers, charging them with cowardice and mutiny. Dax, a lawyer in civilian life, rises to the men's defense but soon realizes that, unless he can prove that the generals were to blame,nothing less than a miracle will save his clients from the firing squad.  A compelling masterpiece from world-class director/writer Stanley Kubrick and screenwriters Calder Willingham and JimThompson, Paths of Glory is a blistering indictment of military politics and \"an unforgettable movie experience\" (Newsweek).", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000KGGJ0Y", "B005152C9G", "B000UJ48SQ", "B00BTYJYR6", "B000UJ48VI", "B000055Y0X", "0783226039", "0792841387", "B007K8ILTW", "B004L9GMBC", "B00004XPPC", "B0013D8LKO", "B000P0J09C", "B00005U8F4", "0143106112", "B00005PJ8T", "6305999872", "B004O724M2", "B0042FDCR2", "B00005AUKD", "B00005ATQB", "B0011FDVGI", "B00006ADD5", "B0049985XW", "0767802470", "0780020707", "B001WLMOL4", "B000O78L0U", "B000UJCAKY", "B0087ZG7OI", "B000HWZ4CA", "B0010YSD7W", "B0046YK4KW", "B00005JPKE", "B00AQ6J64O", "B00D9BNONW", "0792839730", "B004SJVQ4I", "B00005UQ7T", "B00003CXBU", "079284646X", "B003ELKNH2", "B00AEBB89C", "B000G8NXYG", "B000EHSVS2", "B004HHX9XC", "B0002MHE1O", "B00008AOTN", "B005KQVE1S", "B0007TKNLA", "0767830555", "B0000639EU", "B000CNESN0", "B000K0YLZ0", "B005SQ3AO4", "B003ZEQMH8", "B00065GX64", "0792841662", "B00008PC13", "B0006GAOJA", "B002VWNIDG", "B0007Z0NYQ", "B000025RE7", "B002VWNIAY", "B00AEFYSEA", "B000M2E30O", "B00006RCNV", "B002E01MBA", "B000MTEFWS", "B000O599VC", "B00AEFXN9G", "B00DHN8G3U", "B0050FXDDQ", "B000O599ZS", "B000AQKUH2", "6305132917", "B003O7I6SE", "B0000AMRUP", "B006TTC5HC", "B0045HCJTO", "B00008LDO3", "B001DW2BIS", "B007Y1NR1W", "B0007TKNGA", "B00097DY2A", "B000MV90B2", "B0007PALZ2", "B0045HCJ8U", "B000TXNDV6", "B001KXZGO6", "B004NWPY3E", "B0006HBV3C", "0783225903", "B00AEFXG2U", "B00004XPPE", "0783228457", "0792841670", "B003AND1GY", "B008MIMWP8", "B000A2WJBQ"], "bought_together": ["B000KGGJ0Y", "B00BTYJYR6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005152C9G", "B000UJ48SQ", "B000KGGJ0Y", "0783226039"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 21200}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "DOUGLAS,KIRK", "asin": "0792841409", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TDZ1EGVPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Paths of Glory"}
{"description": "The first feature from director Danny Boyle, producer Andrew MacDonald, and screenwriter John Hodge (who went on to make the enormously popularTrainspotting, the not-so-well-receivedA Life Less Ordinary, andThe Beach),Shallow Gravebegins with three obnoxious roommates mockingly interrogating applicants who want to share their spacious flat. The guy they finally choose doesn't last long--they find him dead from a drug overdose along with a suitcase full of money that he no longer needs. They decide to keep the money; this of course requires that they discreetly dispose of the body, which proves to be a gruesome, traumatic business. They begin to suspect each other of betrayal and become increasingly deranged.

He enlists his frustrated photographer  girlfriend Michelle Forbes, who desperately wants to leave the East Coast  for L.A., to illustrate the tome, and they advertise for riding partners.  Luckily for them, they wind up with a veteran killer, the greasy trailer-park  ex-con Brad Pitt, who decides to skip parole with his cowering child-woman  girlfriend Juliette Lewis. Duchovny is enamored by gun-toting Pitt's  recklessness and lawless disregard for, well, everything; he's simultaneously  terrified and thrilled by Pitt's brutal beating of a barfly.

Pitt brings a ferocious magnetism to his part, but  it's still hard to buy genial Duchovny's odd attraction; Juliette Lewis conveys a  terrifying sense of victimization with her poor dumb creature.

They find themselves teamed up against a giant Kodiak bear, and their own inner demons, when lost together in the Alaskan wilderness. There is a lot going on in this picture, as the subject matter includes male rivalry, the isolationism of extreme wealth, and, most conspicuously, the survival of the fittest. Mamet's script, which sounds a little too arch in spots, is well served by New Zealand director Lee Tamahori, who knows how to capture beauty and brutality in one frame. Although the themes are enormous in scope, they are well balanced. One rarely overpowers the other, nor does the achingly beautiful scenery overshadow the acting. Even if you do not like the intellectualism of the dialogue, there are some great scenes with the bear.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783216084", "6300182304", "6300182452", "0783222955", "B00003BE3X", "B00003CXFU", "0783223218", "6302945089", "6301888901", "6301208773", "6303020089", "6302787564", "6304258984", "0800132009"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 312341}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.94, "brand": "", "asin": "0793927501", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518EXVXQ1VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Edge [VHS]"}

{"description": "This 1993 film by David Anspaugh (Hoosiers) is slowly building a reputation as a minor highlight of '90s movies. Based on a true story,Rudystars Sean Astin as Rudy Ruettiger, a blue-collar kid whose father (Ned Beatty) worships Notre Dame football but who would never dare to dream that any of his sons could be a part of the team. The film is entirely about Ruettiger's ceaseless if sometimes wavering commitment toward that goal, despite tremendous obstacles in physical stature, education requirements, the dismissiveness of coaches, poverty, his father's envy, and endless delays of one kind or another. This is the sort of film that looks back on a life and says the battle was its own reward, not the glory. Astin is very moving as a boy who becomes a man and watches his world change, often in unexpected ways, through painful determination. Great support from Beatty, Lili Taylor as a hometown girl, and Robert Prosky and Charles S. Dutton as two valuable mentors.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000056VP3", "B0000399WQ"], "bought_together": ["B0000399WQ", "B000056VP3"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 293760}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.54, "brand": "", "asin": "0800128052", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AGFRMRG5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rudy [VHS]"}

A long-time environmental activist, Gore first became aware of evidence on global warming in the 1970s, and since leaving public office he has become a passionate advocate for large- and small-scale changes in our laws and lifestyles that could help alleviate this crisis. An Inconvenient Truth records a multi-media presentation hosted by Gore in which he discusses the scientific facts behind global warming, explains how it has already begun to affect our environment, talks about the disastrous consequences if the world's governments and citizens do not act, and shares what each individual can do to help protect the Earth for this and future generations.

{"description": "Fully aware of its status as the sequel to the surprise hit thriller of 1996, this lively follow-up trades freshness for familiarity, playing on our affection for returning characters while obeying--and then subverting--the \"rules\" of sequels. Once again, movie references are cleverly employed to draw us into the story, which takes place two years after the events ofScream, at a small Ohio college, where theScreamsurvivors reunite when another series of mysterious killings begins. Capitalizing on the guesswork involving a host of potential suspects, director Wes Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson have crafted a thriller that's more of aScreamclone than a genuinely inventive new story. But the shocks are just as effective, and escalating tension leads to a tautly staged climax that's simultaneously logical and giddily over the top. Background information for trivia buffs: to preserve the secrecy of plot twists, copies of the screenplay were heavily guarded during production and restricted to only the most crucial personnel. When an early draft was circulated on the Internet, screenwriter Kevin Williamson did rewrites, and subsequent drafts were printed with red ink on brown paper, eliminating the threat of photocopying. None of the cast members knew who the killer was until the final scenes were filmed!--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SIP9P6", "B004SIP9MY", "B004LWZW2O", "6305017115", "6305300801", "B004SIP9E2", "B004P7CNUY", "B004SIP9I8", "B00AEFY2WI", "B00005LC4Q", "B00AEFY2LO", "B00AEFY31S", "B00AEFY37C", "0780631684", "B00AEFY1V0", "0767824954", "B000A5045Q", "B000FA57UI", "B004P7CM9Q", "B0000VCZMK", "B004EPZ08O", "B000FA57US", "B00006FI0R", "B00AEFY2AA", "B001NPD9LS", "B001B1UO6W", "B00AEFY2E6", "B000VKL6Z2", "B004P7CN7W", "B000FOQ1KY", "B00005JLZK", "0783232039", "B004SIP9KQ", "B0000AOX09", "B001GCUO4S", "B000RIWAVW", "B00006FDBT", "B00AEFYYH6", "B002ZG971U", "B000FC2HS6", "B005CFC0N8", "0783230451", "B0053TWVDC", "B001L9EXUC", "B00BM4Q4H6", "B00105303S", "B00CAATSME", "B000FSME9W", "B003Q6D27S", "B000LC3ID8", "B0000AOX08", "B000CRR31U", "B00275EHFU", "B0000E2R6P", "B0056P6SOG", "B00006LPHA", "B00JQF7ZR6", "B00005RHGK", "B001DJLD0S", "B00018D42W", "B0000541TL", "B00005JMDZ", "B00DTPRZ10", "B000I2J736", "0780630890", "B00004W4UD", "B00J81S92S", "B00005JND2", "B000069I05", "B000KJU1KK", "B001DJLD1W", "B002XD0J80", "B002YICNE2", "0780630904", "B0000D9PNG", "0792840127", "B000Q66Q2O", "B0021L8UXA", "B008JFUNYG", "0780624890", "B0006SSOHC", "B002G1WPG8", "B000GETUDI", "B000RGN2JI", "B00001PE4D", "B000TJBN62", "B00003CWRF", "B00EZ50SGW", "B000P0J06U", "B000I2J68M", "B000099T3M", "B00005JKWJ", "B00AGKH4MG", "B000FS9FE4", "B00GDDNFDW", "B00B96TGQS", "B00000F0AD", "1573628174", "B000AM4P9K", "B0000VCZNE"], "bought_together": ["B004SIP9P6", "B004SIP9MY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005CFBYW6", "B004SIP9MY", "B004LWZW2O", "B004SIP9P6"]}, "price": 2.45, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 253003}, "asin": "1558908498", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41xjwcKMvhL.jpg", "title": "Scream 2"}
{"description": "Hit man Martin Q. Blank (John Cusack) is in an awkward situation. Several of them, actually. He's attending his high school reunion on an assignment; he's got a rival hit man (Dan Aykroyd) on his tail; and he's going to have to explain to his old girlfriend (Minnie Driver) why he stood her up on prom night. This amiable black comedy, cowritten by Cusack and directed by Jonathan Demme prot&eacute;g&eacute; George Armitage (Miami Blues), has the feel of Demme'sSomething WildandMarried to the Mob--which is to say its humor is dark and brightly colored at the same time. Cusack and Driver are utterly charming--as is the leading man's sister, Joan, who plays his secretary. (Ms. Cusack received an Oscar nomination for her next role, inIn & Out.) Alan Arkin is also very funny as Martin's psychiatrist.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CXGA", "B00009OWJY", "B0015XHQVC", "B004SIP9RO", "B00005JKFA", "B002JOUNE8", "B004YCKKFK", "B000065U1Q", "B00005JPT0", "B000BNX3B4", "B00000IQBW", "B000001FJL", "B00005U5AG", "B00BNH9NCU", "B00008K77D", "B001HVZOB6", "B0013D8LBS", "B000P0I4O4", "B003ASLJQ8", "B000DZ7YN8", "B00AADAK5W", "B004SIP7ZS", "0780618548", "B00003CY5G", "B00014NEZI", "B00008DDXK", "B00AEFXE9U", "B000TJ6PBK", "B002ZG97XI", "B00007AJF8", "0767802519", "B00008EY9G", "6305428239", "6305236569", "B0009X7BDC", "B002FU8IWU", "B007P9HW3M", "B000GGSMC6", "B000065V3H", "B00GHJ1YUI", "B004ZNFTDQ", "B000ELL1SA", "6305428034", "B000093FLA", "B0045HCJFS", "B0015XHQUI", "6304698747", "6305428050", "0783229364", "B00006JDVV", "B000274T94", "B000065V3E", "B00008OE4W", "B000053VB4", "B00016MSV2", "B00005V9I0", "B00005JKBC", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B003ASLJPE", "B009YQJ322", "0767812182", "B0000B1OFL", "B004SIP8LG", "B00008975Z", "B00003CY41", "B0029XFN9Y", "B0049IHX2C", "B00005V4XW", "B00AEFXO8Q", "6305263248", "B00BTYJYOY", "B002AS466O", "0767821513", "6304806434", "B002NZK5R8", "B00AEBB9DW", "B002O3Z4VG", "B0000A02TZ", "B00BTYFWEA", "0792846435", "B004CQZFIU", "B00004XPPB", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00026ZG10", "B00AG475K8", "B0000A9GHD", "B004WCTLNY", "B002ZG96ZC", "B00DW5IJR6", "B00009Y3PV", "B002WEEYIQ", "B0012KJ0DK", "B0000524E5", "0767817729", "076782153X", "B000PAAJZ6", "B0007IO6NM", "B00AEFXWXI", "B00AG473GE", "B0010YSD8Q"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXGA", "B00005JKFA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CXGA", "B000QUU4MI", "B002JOUNE8", "B00005JKFA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8109}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "Buena Vista", "asin": "1558908382", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51gX6Vb2znL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Grosse Pointe Blank"}

{"description": "An ultra-cheap B-horror movie, filmed in Lawrence, Kansas, in 1962, with a  really creepyTwilight Zone-style premise and some great shoestring atmosphere.  Wandering into a small town after an auto accident, to begin her new job as a church  organist, young Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) begins to pick up strange vibes: none of  the normal people in town seem to be able to see her, and she keeps being accosted by  freakish pasty-faced types who seem to be dead on their feet. The nightmarish finale  benefits from its one-of-a-kind \"found\" setting, an empty amusement park rising like a  ghostly castle from the prairie landscape. This is much less aggressive and violent film  than George Romero's originalNight of the Living Dead, but for sheer skin- crawling spookiness, it's in the same class.--David Chute --This text refers to an out  of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001BSBBGC", "B0002V7O0Q", "B0013D8LAE", "B00005NKTH", "B001BSBBNK", "B0009X75EC", "B00004Z1FN", "B00027JYLC", "B00DZP1C9K", "B00ITZXDDY", "B00DBNLBAQ", "B0045HCJJE", "B0007GAG42", "B00DOZNGC2", "B00180R06I", "B004X63SCY", "B000C65YHG", "B000RPCJ9I", "B0026VBOJ2", "B009KG7ESG", "B004NWPY3E", "B000S0GYRU", "B003WKL6XA", "B005FQ2H0A", "B000F6IHTA", "B00DZP1C8Q", "B001BSBBMQ", "0780021134", "B00005O5CA", "B000A0GOEQ", "B005D0RDKM", "B00005LC4J", "B001M9ELJY", "B008BWFOXM", "B001BSBBGM", "B0000694WH", "B00006JMQG", "B000A0GOF0", "B001D5C1OO", "B00FERT0PK", "B0000A9GHP", "B000IMUYJM", "B00000ILEU", "0780022629", "B00027JYMG", "B00AGKH714", "B000VUQ4HW", "B004KDYR20", "B00DZP1C4A", "B00005NSXY", "B001BSBBIK", "B009KG7F30", "B004NWPY1Q", "B00EFYB03S", "B0047P5FU4", "B001SGEUFQ", "0783116926", "B00HRUQ7WG", "B001J710Y8", "B008MPQ0G8", "B000FFJZO2", "B00KIZY2QA", "B0009X770O", "B001BSBBDU", "B0000694WM", "B0001611DI", "B000063K1F", "B00J2PQYYK", "B000GRUQJW", "B004RPQSVE", "6305999872", "B00DBNLAZW", "B00HRUQ8X4", "B00E3WKWCC", "B00A429Y56", "B00005NFZC", "B000035Z3K", "B00E0FW0M2", "B00FJYXP36", "B00DI68EBK", "B0000AUHOK", "B00004W3HG", "B00009PY4A", "B00009NHBC", "B00HRJVHOU", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B000093NQZ", "B001BSBBJE", "B000068TPF", "B00AWWX8YG", "6305760403", "B00A429Y9M", "B000AQKU72", "B00508W2Z8", "B00005JKPT", "B0083Q4JXM", "B00005R1O7", "B00CUKTHES", "B00BCMT2BI", "B00B2M7ENG"], "bought_together": ["B0013D8LAE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00027JYLC", "B00DZP1C9K", "B0045HCJJE", "B0026VBOK6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 109002}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.79, "brand": "Image Entertainment", "asin": "1559409002", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61A7HYVRS0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Carnival of Souls (The Criterion Collection)"}

{"description": "The Best of Chris Farleyblasts through 68 minutes of the wildly hilarious characters the comic actor created while withSaturday Night Livein the early 1990s. Farley was a comedic gem--not only because he created such bizarre, repulsively funny characters, such as Matt Foley, Motivational Speaker, or Lori Davis, cosmetics infomercial queen, but because he lived completely inside the character, delivering lines with whatever fury, stupidity, hypertension, insecurity, or femininity the situation demanded. Clearly, Farley loved making people laugh and he wasn't afraid to use his big bulk to do it, whether it entailed stripping as a Chippendale's dancer, belly flopping on coffee tables, rolling around on a couch as Tom Arnold, or punching his forehead in dismay on the \"Chris Farley Show.\" What's great about this collection is all of those characters appear; what's disappointing is that some don't linger long enough, while others appear a bit too long. The cafeteria-lady number could've been cut short in lieu of a longer Tom Arnold segment, or Herlihy Boy could've been removed altogether in favor of complete \"Chris Farley Show\" segments. Still, if you forgot how side-splitting Farley's portrayal of Dom DeLuise or the French-fry-stuffing Gap girl was, this video will happily jog your memory.--Karen Karleski", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002I84FI", "B004CJB0CC"], "bought_together": ["B0002I84FI"], "also_viewed": ["B0000C2IQW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 483702}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 4.98, "brand": "", "asin": "1573626163", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RHZWZA8YL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Saturday Night Live - The Best of Chris Farley [VHS]"}
{"description": "If you're not a connoisseur of graphic horror and gruesome gore, you'd better steer clear of this wicked 1992 horror-comedy from the demented mind and delirious camera of New Zealand-born writer-director Peter Jackson. However, if nonstop mayhem and extreme violence are your idea of great entertainment, you're sure to appreciate Jackson's gleefully inventive approach to a story that can judiciously be described as sick, twisted, and totally outrageous. The movie's central character is a poor schmuck named Lionel who's practically enslaved to his domineering mother. But when ol' Mum gets bitten by a rare and poisonous rat monkey from Skull Island and is turned into a flesh-eating zombie, Lionel has the unfortunate task of keeping Mama happy while fending off all the other zombies that result from her voracious feeding frenzies. If you've read this far, you'll either be crying out for censorship or eagerly awaiting your first viewing (or second, or third...) of this wildly clever and audaciously uninhibited movie. And while director Jackson would later achieve critical success with his fact-based dramaHeavenly Creatures, his talent is readily evident in this earlier effort. If you find this kind of thing even remotely appealing, considerDead Alivea must-see movie.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004Z1GI", "B008CYDD7I", "B0002C9DK4", "B00005KH30", "B0001611DI", "B000065FS6", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000F3UA8E", "B000068IEV", "B0024FAG44", "0783227434", "B000WC3864", "B000RPCK2O", "0783228457", "B001D5C1OO", "B00009YXHN", "B000JU7JIW", "B000GIXCL0", "B002VKB0KG", "B00004TJM8", "B000S0GYRU", "B000094J72", "B0002VYOVS", "B0000DC12T", "B0036R92US", "B000T28POC", "B001B187L6", "B00JQYV0B4", "B00000K3TO", "B001BP14MG", "B000068TPD", "B000I2J68M", "B001D5C1R6", "B000096I9V", "B000HXDWRS", "B000FS9FE4", "B0001LQJMQ", "B0002KQNL8", "078322799X", "B00D7AM6M0", "078062856X", "B00125WATQ", "B0001ZX0GK", "B0007WQHI0", "B0000AOX0F", "B002GHHHG0", "B000E1P2EY", "B00JF5GAIW", "B0053TWV46", "B0053TWW9K", "B0013D8LAE", "B000CR76U8", "B001MEJY8W", "B008874968", "B0057O6IMS", "B00005N5RM", "B0053TWW36", "B0009WFEDC", "B002E01MHY", "B000TJ6PB0", "B0009OUBC4", "B000HXDWNM", "6304852444", "B00005K3O4", "B00IF8Q0YE", "B000WC389G", "B00DWG5GIA", "B0002DB5PO", "B003Q6D246", "B000TSIJWY", "B00GGY4R3K", "B00DI012O2", "B000S0GYRK", "B001J710Y8", "B00GHH9IIA", "B005J9ZE5I", "B002EOVXBK", "B0002CHK1S", "B004KDYR20", "B0000A9D19", "B001D262LA", "B000V4UH08", "B000HT38B2", "B0024FADD8", "B000TZJCMS", "B001FOK70S", "B000MV8AC2", "B005OT810I", "B000KRNG54", "B004EI2NP4", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B005CM1IES", "B0000CEB6Y", "B000TZJCN2", "B000RIWAV2", "B002OVO18A", "B001I82RVS", "B002HML6YI", "B001CW7ZWG", "B00005JO16"], "bought_together": ["B00004Z1GI", "B008CYDD7I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005R24K", "B008CYDD7I", "B0024FADDI", "B000068IEV"]}, "price": 59.9, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15538}, "asin": "157362408X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZD8DCJAWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dead Alive"}

{"description": "Even a man who is pure in heart,And says his prayers by night,May become a wolf when the wolfbane bloomsAnd the autumn moon is bright.If you haven't heard this piece of horror-movie doggerel before, you'll never forget it after seeingThe Wolf Manfor two reasons: it's a spooky piece of rhyme and nearly everybody in the picture recites it at one time or another. Set in a fog-bound studio-built Wales,The Wolf Mantells the doom-laden tale of Lawrence Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.), who returns to the estate of his wealthy father (Claude Rains). (Yes, Chaney's American, but the movie explains this, awkwardly.) Bitten by a werewolf, Talbot suffers the classic fate of the victims of lycanthropy: at the full moon, he turns into a werewolf, a transformation ingeniously devised by makeup maestro Jack Pierce. Pierce was the man who turned Boris Karloff into the Frankenstein monster, and his werewolf makeup became equally famous, with its canine snout and bushy hairdo--and, of course, seriously sharp dental work.The Wolf Manwas a smash hit, giving Universal Pictures a new monster for their already crowded stable, and Chaney found himself following in the footsteps (or paw prints) of his father, who had essayed a monster or two in the silent era. This is a classy horror outing, with strong atmosphere and a thoughtful script by Curt Siodmak--well, except for the stiff romantic bits between Chaney and Evelyn Ankers. It's also got Bela Lugosi (briefly) and Maria Ouspenskaya, the prunelike Russian actress who foretells doom like nobody's business.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300183084", "6302120101", "6300181278", "6300181286", "6300183629", "6300185281", "6300185443", "630252542X", "6302843219", "6300181820", "6302526167", "6301257014", "630018529X", "6302841763", "6301005783", "6302526175", "630284178X", "6303626424", "6301967410", "6302841771", "6302884713", "6302843227", "0790736055", "6302841798", "6302841844", "6302814707", "6302526140", "6302182530", "6302526191", "6302526094", "6302194296", "630281474X", "6300247589", "6304507348", "6300208508", "630210176X", "6302526183", "B000HDNPM0", "6303128645", "6300182983", "630214227X", "6302101743", "0790736071", "6303158579", "B00005A1VH", "0783235593", "B00000J2KZ", "1564427099", "630197350X"], "bought_together": ["6300183084", "6302120101"], "also_viewed": ["6300181278", "6302120101", "6300181286", "6300183084", "630018529X", "6300185281", "6300183629", "6302843219", "630252542X", "B00000K14A", "6302843197", "6300185443", "6302526086", "6302526175", "6300181820", "6302841771", "6302841763", "6303129013", "6303129161", "B008FL8OTK", "6302841879", "6302843200", "630312917X", "630252587X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 211621}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.29, "brand": "", "asin": "6300183092", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VRRBHJATL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wolf Man [VHS]"}
{"description": "This is the TV movie that put Steven Spielberg on the map, shortly before he madeThe Sugarland Express. Working from a script by Richard Matheson, the film stars Dennis Weaver as a mild-mannered traveling salesman who unintentionally angers the driver of a semi truck. Suddenly, the truck is not only riding his tail but trying to run him off the road. No matter what he does (pulling over, stopping at a diner, calling the cops), he can't get rid of it. Spielberg makes the wise decision of never showing the driver, even as he cranks the voltage on the film's suspense elements. As a result, the truck itself takes on an air of satanic menace--even a personality of sorts--as it seems to hunt its human prey. Spielberg made a lot out of a little, suggesting just how skilled a storyteller he would become.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["0764006770", "B0013527K2", "630197705X", "0792835077", "630180550X", "6301976061", "0792846443", "B00AEFXX9Q", "6305123616", "6300214060", "B004IB04NK", "6300213838", "6303471552", "6302890721", "6303148352", "B0000068EE", "6301969413", "6304071876", "6302038308", "0790733897", "0790734079", "6302516919", "6300213900", "6300181340", "0783231482", "6300181286", "0783235607", "6304005512"], "bought_together": ["B0013527K2"], "also_viewed": ["B0013527K2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 250761}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6300181987", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FN746KT0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Duel [VHS]"}
{"description": "Wake Island, a sandbar rising 21 feet out of the South Pacific, was  among the first U.S. outposts to be hit by the Japanese, virtually  simultaneously with Pearl Harbor.Wake Islandthe movie was among  Hollywood's earliest responses to America's being attacked and drawn into WWII.  The Marine Corps defenders of Wake became instant war heroes, akin to the martyrs of the Alamo. Nothing could be done to rescue or even to reinforce and resupply them, and they fought on through air attacks and naval bombardment for two weeks until, finally overrun, they were wiped out.That searing historical context had a lot to do with the movie's impact in 1942, and the sight of the dark forms of enemy planes coming over the horizon for the first time still carries a shock.Wake Island's a decent film, and it doesn't dishonor its subject with sham heroics and grandstanding. But the New York Film Critics voted John Farrow best director of 1942, and that's a reach. The first half hour sets up the allegory of America as melting pot (there's even a corporal named Goebbels), establishes horseplay as the coin of democratic discourse (especially for gyrenes Robert Preston and the Oscar-nominated William Bendix), and fosters familiar friction between new commander Brian Donlevy and civilian construction supervisor Albert Dekker. Then shortly after a beaming Japanese peace envoy has stopped by for dinner, things get rough.  The scenes of warfare are more than adequate, but they'd soon be outdone,  sometimes in films much less worthy thanWake Island.--Richard T.

Eventually the two men team up to teach the nasty old manipulators a lesson, cornering the market in frozen orange juice futures in the process.

{"description": "This semi-remake ofHoliday Inn(the first movie in which Irving Berlin's perennial, Oscar-winning holiday anthem was featured) doesn't have much of a story, but what it does have is choice: Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney, an all-Irving Berlin song score, classy direction by Hollywood vet Michael Curtiz (Casablanca,The Adventures of Robin Hood), VistaVision (the very first feature ever shot in that widescreen format), and ultrafestive Technicolor! Crosby and Kaye are song-and-dance men who hook up, romantically and professionally, with a \"sister\" act (Clooney and Vera-Ellen) to put on a Big Show to benefit the struggling ski-resort lodge run by the beloved old retired general (Dean Jagger) of their WWII Army outfit. Crosby is cool, Clooney is warm, Kaye is goofy, and Vera-Ellen is leggy. Songs include: \"Sisters\" (Crosby and Kaye do their own drag version, too), \"Snow,\" \"We'll Follow the Old Man,\" \"Mandy,\" \"Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep,\" and more.

{"description": "Back when the  firstStar Trekfeature was released in December 1979, theTrekfranchise was still relatively modest, consisting of the original TV series, an animated cartoon series from 1973-74, and a burgeoning fan network around the world. Series creator Gene Roddenberry had conceived a second TV series, but after the success ofStar Warsthe project was upgraded into this lavish feature film, which reunited the original series cast aboard a beautifully redesigned starship U.S.S.Enterprise. Under the direction of Robert Wise (best known forWest Side Story), the film proved to be a mixed blessing forTrekfans, who heatedly debated its merits; but it was, of course, a phenomenal hit. Capt. Kirk (William Shatner) leads his crew into the vast structures surrounding V'Ger, an all-powerful being that is cutting a destructive course through Starfleet space. With his new First Officer (Stephen Collins), the bald and beautiful Lieutenant Ilia (played by the late Persis Khambatta) and his returning veteran crew, Kirk must decipher the secret of V'Ger's true purpose and restore the safety of the galaxy. The story is rather overblown and derivative of plots from the original series, and avid Trekkies greeted the film's bland costumes with derisive laughter. But as a feast for the eyes, this is an adventure worthy of big-screen trekkin'. Douglas Trumbull's visual effects are astonishing, and Jerry Goldmith's score is regarded as one of the prolific composer's very best (with its main theme later used forStar Trek: The Next Generation). And, fortunately forStar Trekfans, the expanded 143-minute version (originally shown for the film's network TV premiere) is generally considered an improvement over the original theatrical release.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300214400", "6300213803", "6301543408", "6303202004", "630021463X", "6303909949", "B0000AUHOH", "B00008OSD3", "6301792734", "6305587159", "6300182304", "B0000A36J1", "B000065U6Q", "6304415346", "6305365121", "630336568X", "0671830880", "6300214060", "6304935811", "6302380588", "6303651488"], "bought_together": ["6300213803", "6300214400"], "also_viewed": ["6300213803", "6301543408", "B00DB97LRC", "6300214400", "630021463X", "B00BAXTYIA", "B00005JLRT", "6303202004", "B00DB97LCM", "B00000ILBK", "B002I9Z8DK", "B0000AUHOH", "B002I9Z8B2", "6304415346", "6304539258", "B000USUA8Y", "B002I9Z8CG", "B0095XPZBC", "B002I9Z8GW", "B001TH16DI", "B0083TUEHY", "B00HETWFVC", "630273486X", "B000HEWEJ4", "6303909949", "6300213668"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 278050}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.79, "brand": "", "asin": "6300216802", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4164CYFHC6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek - The Motion Picture [VHS]"}
{"description": "This 1986 comedy out of Australia is so old-fashioned in its romantic charm that one can't help but wonder what it would have looked like with Clark Gable and Carole Lombard in the leads. On the other hand, it's hard to imagine anyone besides Paul Hogan as the title character, a laid-back Aussie tracker who shows an American reporter (Linda Kozlowski) around bush country, then accompanies her to New York City. Sure, Hollywood has done the fish-out-of-water scenario to death in the last 20 years, and while this film has sufficient sport with the gimmick, it is largely driven by the principal characters and their developing love affair. Hogan cowrote the script and director Peter Faiman evokes the goofy, enchanted air of screwball comedies. The climactic scene, set in a subway station with scores of bystanders witnessing a conversation about relationship commitment, feels like vintage Capra.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301217985", "0767825411", "B00005N5VA", "6300182185", "0792133153", "6300183041", "630150528X"], "bought_together": ["6301217985", "B00005N5VA"], "also_viewed": ["6301217985", "B00HW3L2R8", "B00005N5SB"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 209313}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.42, "brand": "", "asin": "6300218066", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EMKQ4HE7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Crocodile Dundee [VHS]"}

{"description": "Based upon T.H. White's beloved novel, this Disney-fied version chronicles the tutoring of the Once and Future King, Arthur, as handled by the magician Merlin.Swordwas a portent of things to come, with slapstick upbraiding storytelling, and cultural in-jokes substituting for wonder. But there's much to enjoy here as Merlin shows Newt, the young Arthur, things that will help him become the ruler of the Britons. The transformation sequences, where the boy is turned into a fish, a bird, and a squirrel are vintage Disney. The oft-repeated scene of Merlin battling it out with the mean old Madame Mim still is worth a few chuckles, but it belies the problem with most of the film--the scenes are only there for the chuckles. References by Merlin to television and other items of modern life also mar the generally innocuous landscape. Children will like it, but they won't cherish it.--Keith Simanton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302178924", "6304500831", "6305319138", "6300274268", "0788812408", "6304401132", "0788812807", "0788802194", "6302320402", "6302642248", "0788806270", "6304978286", "6302526574", "078881172X", "6300274195", "155890641X", "6303983812", "6304400551", "6303314015", "6302961572", "6304290888", "0788805843", "6302787068", "6301390725", "6305229449", "B00003CXQX", "B00004R99N", "6302426200", "6304100507", "6300274608", "B000035Z2S", "6304089767", "6304400225", "6303929338", "6302158095", "B00000ICHA", "0788805533", "B00005JKDQ", "6301991311", "0788803743", "B0000AQZYM", "6305940932", "B00005RDVV", "6303036813", "0788812440", "6305326940", "B00003CX7L", "6304501153", "1558906150", "1558901892", "B00004R996", "6303534422", "B00003CXHR", "B00005T7H6", "6301948106", "0788811002", "B0000524CZ", "B00016JF2W", "B00005JKX3", "B00003CWPW", "6304089201", "B00005JLR1", "6302484359", "B0009SUS4Q", "6304873441", "B00004R99A", "B00003CXG6", "B0000E32WB", "6303486894", "6303939015", "B00004R99I", "6303315305", "0788812181", "B00335EQ0E", "B00005JL95", "6304117752", "B00CTNYLQA", "6303122647", "B00000J2JA", "6304400381", "B00000JS61", "6301752686", "6303206204", "B0002YLCHE", "B00000I7Q3", "6300276554", "630197736X", "B000035Z46", "B00008Y47S", "6304492960", "6304155972", "B00007AJLB", "6303295614", "6303392350", "6300277003", "6304401736", "6303394345", "0790744759", "6303991408"], "bought_together": ["6302178924", "6304500831"], "also_viewed": ["6302178924", "6304500831", "6302642248", "078881172X", "0788812408", "6305319138", "6302320402", "6304400551", "0788802194", "6303983812", "6302787068", "0788812807", "6300274268", "0788805843", "0788806270", "6303314015", "155890641X", "6304978286", "6302426200", "B00004R99N", "6304401132", "6304290888", "B000035Z2S", "6303929338", "6302158095", "6303036813", "6300274195", "6302961572", "6302526574", "B00005JL95", "6304100507", "0788805533", "6304089767", "6305326940", "B0007KTBIU", "B00005RDVV", "6303534422", "6305229449", "6304400225", "6301390725", "B0000AQZYM", "6301991311", "B00003CXQX", "B00003CX7L", "B00003CXHR", "6300274608", "B00005JKDQ", "6305940932", "6304089201", "B00CTNYLQA", "6304873441", "B0000524CZ", "6304501153", "0788812440", "B000035Z46", "6305942285", "6301948106", "B00000ICHA", "B0034GK74G"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 166738}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.28, "brand": "", "asin": "6300275310", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VHD7VWN3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Sword in the Stone (Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection) [VHS]"}
{"description": "The off-Broadway comedy-horror-musical hit that ran for years makes a successful transfer to film with a bevy of big-name cameos and two perfectly cast leads. Rick Moranis is the nebbish Seymour, who pines for flower-girl Audrey (Ellen Greene) while living in the basement of florist Mr. Mushnik (Vincent Gardenia). Things start turning around for Seymour, though, after he buys a little plant during a solar eclipse, christens it Audrey II, and discovers that it likes to drink blood. Soon enough, though, Seymour finds out that Audrey II, now grown to epic proportions, is in actuality a \"mean green mother from outer space\" that is hell-bent on world domination. Based on the 1960 Roger Corman cheapie that featured a young Jack Nicholson,Little Shopboasts a hilarious, amazing score by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken, who would go on to revitalize Disney's animation arm withThe Little MermaidandBeauty and the Beast. Greene, the lone holdover from the original cast, is a ravishing, goofy Audrey, whose awkward demeanor belies a voice that could knock Ethel Merman off her feet. She's ably matched by Moranis, whose lack of a singing voice is perfectly in sync with Seymour's nerdiness. And Levi Stubbs Jr. of the Four Tops provides the lowdown, nasty-minded voice of Audrey II; his rendition of the Oscar-nominated \"Mean Green Mother from Outer Space\" is a showstopper. As for those celebrity cameos, Steve Martin's sadistic dentist is a masterful creation, as is Bill Murray's masochistic patient; John Candy, James Belushi, and Christopher Guest also pop up. And there was never a lovelier and funkier Greek chorus than the three Motown-fueled girls (Tichina Arnold, Michelle Weeks, and Tisha Campbell) who appear throughout the film.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301871952", "B00000JGEI", "6303212379"], "also_viewed": ["B006ZUMNPY", "6302890926", "B00005BGO9"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 66547}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6300271285", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NA5EZ89NL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Little Shop of Horrors [VHS]"}

They decide to test whether this is the real thing by agreeing to split up, then meet in six months atop the Empire State Building. Is there anyone who can resist that setup or the tragic romantic mishap that nearly splits them up? Can you keep dry eyes during the famous finale?

{"description": "Joseph Mankiewicz's moody classic is less ghost story than romantic fantasy, a handsome 1947 drama of impossible love set on the picturesque turn-of-the-century New England coast. Independent young widow Lucy Muir (the luminous Gene Tierney), desperate to escape her uptight in-laws, falls in love with a grand seaside house and moves in, only to discover the cantankerous ghost of the hot-tempered Captain Gregg (a histrionically flamboyant performance by Rex Harrison). Lucy refuses to let the bombastic captain frighten her away, earning his respect, his friendship, and later his love. They team up to turn the captain's salty memoirs into a bestseller, but as his affection grows he fades away, leaving Lucy free to undertake a more worldly suitor, notably a charismatic children's author (George Sanders at his smarmy smoothest) with his own guarded secret. Charles Lang's melancholy black-and-white photography and Bernard Herrmann's haunting score set the tone for this sublime adult drama, and Tierney delivers one of her most understated performances as the resolute Mrs. Muir. Mankiewicz turns this ghost story into a refreshingly mature and down-to-earth romance.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["630266232X", "6302320496", "6302227127", "630150528X", "0767825616", "630197350X", "0792151712", "B00005A1VH", "6303402070", "B00003OSTO", "6303057225", "6300988791", "B00000JKNL", "6301773586", "0783235593", "6301977688", "0783221347", "6301586050", "6301964012", "0780614097", "6300183912", "6305126062", "6301670140", "6301978536", "6301972171", "6303120474", "6301969049", "6303364772", "B0000068Z8", "6301797906", "1558807780", "0783236352", "B000GX4476", "6302130379", "B00000IBME", "B003MG6FJY", "6301628616", "6303209890", "0790743159", "6300181340", "B000CQD1ZS", "B000006FR5", "B00000F13X", "6301797957", "6301986040", "6302464889", "5559477621", "6300267970", "6302800897"], "bought_together": ["6302320496"], "also_viewed": ["6304005490", "0783235593"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 113812}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6301586042", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HEY8NM3EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ghost &amp; Mrs Muir [VHS]"}

{"description": "This 1963 extravaganza, directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, is certainly an epic historical drama with all the elements: elaborate sets, intricate costuming, name actors, a factual basis, and an overlong script (just over four hours). But the acting is well performed and the backdrops are lush, making this a film worth seeing. Elizabeth Taylor is Cleopatra, the Egyptian queen who seduces Julius Caesar (Rex Harrison) in a political move to hold onto her empire. When Caesar is killed in the Roman Senate, Cleopatra looks to Marc Antony (Richard Burton) for his support, practically enslaving him with her wiles. Taylor is dramatic in her role, at times overly serious, but stunning nonetheless as the woman described as \"well versed in the natural sciences and mathematics. She speaks seven languages proficiently. Were she not a woman one would consider her to be an intellectual.\" While the film does seem to drag at moments, it deserves the four Oscars it won for cinematography, art direction-set direction, costumes, and special effects. Don't confuse thisCleopatrawith the 1934 version directed by Cecil B. DeMille and starring Claudette Colbert.--Jenny Brown", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301628454", "6304239149", "B000056BRF", "1569942072", "6302797616", "6301976622", "6300216012", "6303282237", "B000056AXZ", "6305123616", "6302655897", "B00BQ7GU1Y", "6301412702", "B00004TX2D", "6300251012", "B002M2Z3BA", "6300215830", "0792845870", "6301964306", "6301976932", "B000006FKX", "6300215644", "6301959728", "6302023769", "6301412796", "B000054OW2", "6300215717", "630361633X", "B004FQX5B6", "0005119359", "6300215741", "0792844645", "6302354110", "B008QE9XD2", "B00004CIOV", "B00000I1DI", "6305237115", "B00000F3QZ", "6301628632", "6301590449", "1563712962", "6301599225", "6303257828", "0790733935", "6304039506", "630344394X", "B00005NKW1", "0792837576", "6301670140", "6300198731", "6302098424", "6305496048", "6303050050", "0005166004", "1555265952", "6301802330", "6300182304", "6304457316", "0792110188", "6301986024", "6301978633", "6301586026", "6301662962", "6304006063"], "bought_together": ["6301628454", "B000056BRF"], "also_viewed": ["B001AQO3SS", "B002M2Z3BA", "6301976622", "6302797616", "0800132009"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 297190}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.47, "brand": "", "asin": "6301717570", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TWXPBP4RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cleopatra [VHS]"}

She'd done it effectively, two years prior, in 1935'sThe Little Colonelwith grandfather Lionel Barrymore. Now inHeidishe turns her reclusive grumpy grandfather, Adolf (Jean Hersholt), into the loving sort she knows he really is. Heidi is an orphan, dumped into the Swiss Alps by self-centered Aunt Dete (Mady Christians) onto a grandfather she's never known, but they soon learn to love each other. Heidi's mercenary aunt returns and sells (!) Heidi to a cruel woman, appropriately named Fraulein Rottenmeier (Mary Nash). Adolf sets out on a quest to find his granddaughter. Meanwhile, Heidi charms Klara Sesemann (Marcia Mae Jones), the wealthy handicapped girl in Fraulein Rottenmeier's care. Look for a delightful Arthur Treacher as the Sesemann butler. There's a cute fantasy production number, \"In Our Little Wooden Shoes,\" featuring Temple in various period costumes. ThroughoutHeidi, Temple is, as always, wonderfully joyful.

{"description": "2001: A Space Odysseytook the world on a mind-bending trip to  outer space, butFantastic Voyageis the original psychedelic inner-space  adventure. When a brilliant scientist falls into a coma with an inoperable blood  clot in the brain, a surgical team embarks on a top-secret journey to the center  of the mind in a high-tech military submarine shrunk to microbial dimensions.  Stephen Boyd stars as a colorless commander sent to keep an eye on things  (though his eyes stay mostly on shapely medical assistant Raquel Welch), while  Donald Pleasance is suitably twitchy as the claustrophobic medical consultant.  The science is shaky at best, but the imaginative spectacle is marvelous:  scuba-diving surgeons battle white blood cells, tap the lungs to replenish the oxygen  supply, and shoot the aorta like daredevil surfers. The film took home a  well-deserved Oscar for Best Visual Effects. Director Richard Fleischer, who turned  Disney's 195420,000 Leagues Under the Seainto one of the most riveting  submarine adventures of all time, creates a picture so taut with cold-war  tensions and cloak-and-dagger secrecy that niggling scientific contradictions  (such as, how do miniaturized humans breathe full-sized air molecules?) seem  moot.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302098424", "6300215539", "B00007JMD8", "B00005JKFR", "6303148352", "6301977742", "6304291698", "6300181537", "6304143184", "0767825411", "B007HO39HI"], "bought_together": ["6302098424", "6304291698"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 306694}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.97, "brand": "", "asin": "6301744160", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HPSKKX8DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fantastic Voyage [VHS]"}

{"description": "Kevin Costner as a warped serial killer, a pillar of the community whose dark side is embodied by an on-screen William Hurt? You have to admit, it sounds intriguing, right?Mr. Brooksis the vehicle for this unsavory story, and it turns out to be a lot less kicky than it sounds. Mr. Brooks is a Portland, Oregon tycoon and philanthropist whose \"addiction\" to murder is suddenly re-surfacing--with plenty of help from his sneering alter ego, who generally sits in the back of the car, goading Mr. Brooks on. (The other characters can't see William Hurt in all this, of course.) The unbelievably convoluted plot has Mr. Brooks confronted by a blackmailer (comedian Dane Cook) who has a surprising twist on things, and trailed by a cop (Demi Moore) who comes equipped with her own set of professional and marital woes. As if that weren't enough, when Brooks's daughter (Danielle Panabaker) comes home, it becomes clear that some traits run in the family.The scenes with Costner and Hurt are the best stuff in the film, even if director Bruce Evans can't figure out how to play fair visualizing their presence to others.

Howard Hawks makes a rousing, heroic film out of the tale, and Cooper gives one of his best performances (for which he won an Oscar). The 1941 feature seems as much a valentine to wartime America (and a not-so-subtle piece of propaganda) as anything, with Hawks capturing splendidly shot scenes of life in York's home state of Tennessee, which in turn provide a striking contrast to the battlefield.

{"description": "Sidney Lumet's directorial debut remains a tense, atmospheric (though slightly manipulative and stagy) courtroom thriller, in which the viewer never sees a trial and the only action is verbal. As he does in his later corruption commentaries such asSerpicoorQ & A, Lumet focuses on the lonely one-man battles of a protagonist whose ethics alienate him from the rest of jaded society. As the film opens, the seemingly open-and-shut trial of a young Puerto Rican accused of murdering his father with a knife has just concluded and the 12-man jury retires to their microscopic, sweltering quarters to decide the verdict. When the votes are counted, 11 men rule guilty, while one--played by Henry Fonda, again typecast as another liberal, truth-seeking hero--doubts the obvious. Stressing the idea of \"reasonable doubt,\" Fonda slowly chips away at the jury, who represent a microcosm of white, male society--exposing the prejudices and preconceptions that directly influence the other jurors' snap judgments. The tight script by Reginald Rose (based on his own teleplay) presents each juror vividly using detailed soliloquies, all which are expertly performed by the film's flawless cast. Still, it's Lumet's claustrophobic direction--all sweaty close-ups and cramped compositions within a one-room setting--that really transforms this contrived story into an explosive and compelling nail-biter.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783222955", "6300181987", "6304071876", "6300183513", "6304039530", "6304119046", "0790731975", "6300987485", "6304429274", "1558807780", "6301977149", "6303282237", "6302413435", "B00000K3C7", "6302226899", "B000BWIZRW", "B000006GCU", "6304111231", "0790743531", "6304111363", "6302935148", "6304383169", "6300181529", "6301797957", "630347327X", "0800125762", "B00008FECE", "6303402348", "6303506291", "630522269X", "6305613516", "0783221347", "6304151306", "6301973305"], "also_viewed": ["B00004YRHZ", "B002VRNJTE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 259403}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.87, "brand": "", "asin": "6301976061", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5188HQ5P25L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "12 Angry Men [VHS]"}

{"description": "If three people light cigarettes from the same match, one will die soon, or at least that's how the old superstition had it. Three childhood friends (Joan Blondell, Bette Davis, Ann Dvorak) laugh it off as they all light up from the same match. Vivian (Dvorak) is married to a wealthy attorney (played by Warren William, in a sympathetic role for once). Bored and stifled in her life, she decides on a walk on the wild side; absconding with their 4-year-old son, she falls in with gangsters and takes a nosedive. Soon she's living the life of a slattern, hooked on cocaine and bootleg liquor, neglecting her son like he's so much excess baggage. Meanwhile her husband and friends are frantic to get the little boy back and set things right again. In this movie's 64-minute running time, director Mervyn LeRoy managed to include Depression-era social commentary, drugs, crime, sex, violence, and some surprisingly well-fleshed-out characterizations. The young Bette Davis is beautiful (even playing one scene in her lingerie), and Blondell and Dvorak are both great in their roles. Even more remarkable, though, is the number of future stars that can be spotted inThree on a Match: Lyle Talbot, a young Anne Shirley, Edward Arnold, and Humphrey Bogart in a great role as a menacing hood.

{"description": "Director Barry Sonnenfeld (Men in Black) brings his distinctly cartoonish sensibility to this feature film version of the old Charles Addams comic strip. Anjelica Huston was born to play Morticia Addams, matriarch of the ghoulish Addams clan, while the late Raul Julia is a very agreeable, lusty Gomez. But it's Christina Ricci who arguably steals the show as their stone-faced daughter, Wednesday. As is often the problem with adaptations of comics or television shows, somehow an original story has to be implemented that doesn't clutter things up. But clutter is an issue here as the script gets tangled on a lame plot concerning efforts to steal the Addams' house and fortune. Still, it's fun to see an ideal cast reanimate an old favorite.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303057942", "0790742322", "0790736969", "6303506291", "B00000F8J1", "6303122647", "6300214753", "6302968143", "0790700506", "6304416415", "6302091632", "B00003CXI0", "B00005LL26", "B00003CXXI", "6303212379", "6302481805", "B000005PFL", "B0000AKCKK", "6303494080"], "bought_together": ["0790742322", "0790700506"], "also_viewed": ["6303057942", "B00AJCUL2G", "0790742322", "B000641D2Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 329238}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6302409365", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DZGADFDNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Addams Family [VHS]"}
{"description": "Star Trek Vleft us nowhere to go but up, and with the return ofStar Trek IIdirector Nicholas Meyer,Star Trek VIrestored the movie series to its classic blend of space opera, intelligent plotting, and engaging interaction of stalwart heroes and menacing villains. Borrowing its subtitle (and several lines of dialogue) from Shakespeare, the movie finds Admiral Kirk (William Shatner) and his fellowEnterprisecrew members on a diplomatic mission to negotiate peace with the revered Klingon Chancellor Gorkon (David Warner). When the high-ranking Klingon and several officers are ruthlessly murdered, blame is placed on Kirk, whose subsequent investigation uncovers an assassination plot masterminded by the nefarious Klingon General Chang (Christopher Plummer) in an effort to disrupt a historic peace summit. As this political plot unfolds,Star Trek VItakes on a sharp-edged tone, with Kirk and Spock confronting their opposing views of diplomacy, and testing their bonds of loyalty when a Vulcan officer is revealed to be a traitor. With a dramatic depth befitting what was to be the final movie mission of the originalStar Trekcrew, this film took the veteran cast out in respectably high style. With the torch being passed to the crew ofStar Trek: The Next Generation, only Kirk, Scotty, and Chekov would return, however briefly, inStar Trek: Generations.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301543408", "630021463X", "6300213803", "6304415346", "6300216802", "6300214400", "6305587159", "6303909949", "B00008OSD3", "B000003K8T", "B000ECVAVW", "B000AA4FII", "6303944736", "B0001DI5W6", "6302424216", "6302510031", "B00005JLTM", "6304047843", "6302510023", "6302380294", "B0000068SI", "B0001VL30O", "B00000K2SC", "6301966988", "6305363668", "6302380596", "B00004TYS8", "0792839846", "B0002TT0NM", "B0000A36J1", "B000005QWI", "B00000JGEK", "630281622X"], "bought_together": ["6301543408", "6300213803"], "also_viewed": ["6301543408", "6300213803", "630021463X", "6300214400", "6300216802", "630273486X", "B00471JSRE", "6304415346", "B00BAXTYIA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 158198}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.99, "brand": "", "asin": "630242335X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XTS50JFQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek VI - The Undiscovered Country [VHS]"}
{"description": "Billy Wilder cowrote and directed this brilliant 1957 mystery based on Agatha Christie's celebrated play about an aging London barrister (Charles Laughton) who's preparing to retire when he takes the defense in the most vexing murder case of his distinguished career. In his final completed film (he died of a heart attack less than a year later), Tyrone Power plays the prime suspect in the murder of a wealthy widow, and Marlene Dietrich plays the wife of the accused, whose testimony--and true identity--holds the key to solving the case. A classic of courtroom suspense,Witness for the Prosecutionis one of those movies with enough double-crossing twists to keep the viewer guessing right up to the very end, when yet another surprise is deftly revealed. This being a Billy Wilder film, the dialogue is first-rate and the acting superb, with both Laughton and his offscreen wife Elsa Lanchester (playing the barrister's pesty nurse) winning Academy Awards for their performances. Although later films would concoct even more complicated courtroom scenarios, this remains one of the best films of its kind and a model for all those films that followed its lead.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0782006779", "6301005740", "6304039530", "6300215741", "6302801133", "6302800897", "0800100832", "6300215644", "6301798732", "B000A9QK7I", "630266232X", "630236308X", "6303364772", "B0000068ZQ", "6301797957", "B000006N70", "B000A1KF8Q", "079284517X", "6301670140", "6302909023", "6302360986", "B00AEFYO5I", "6301805615", "0783217390", "6302700949", "6300267865", "B0018PH3L0", "6302375827", "B005LAIGYQ", "B00004TX24", "6303637574", "6300208060", "B0000068EE", "6301973232", "6305012792", "6304291698", "6300183912", "6300216721", "6300215962", "630141277X", "0783235593", "6302226899", "6302360978", "1558808590", "1558807780", "6301959728", "6301976061", "0800104803", "6301976622", "6302682630", "6300246868", "6301586026", "0792837967", "6301969316", "6302415853", "B000AQOER4", "6301964012", "B00000F13T", "6302308577", "6301977815", "0792837096", "6300268594", "630396155X", "0790743213", "6301798503", "6304119097", "6303686745", "6302842263", "0783236352", "6300181472", "6301801946", "6300182479", "6304111363", "6302023742", "B000021Y6K", "6302305942", "6300181421", "B0009FJKC0", "6301578805", "6301798759", "6304056931", "6304508557", "6300269639", "080013222X", "0790743531", "6302715555", "6302952581", "6304152469", "6301978110", "6302413451", "6301965701", "6302962048", "B000003KE0", "6304359705", "B00005Q4GZ", "078200847X", "6300208133", "6300269264", "6302990084", "0792841026"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFYO5I"], "also_viewed": ["0783235593"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 122280}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6302413435", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5141M0KKZTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Witness for the Prosecution [VHS]"}

{"description": "Throughout his long, wandering, often distinguished career Francis Ford Coppola has made many films that are good and fine, many more that are flawed but undeniably interesting, and a handful of duds that are worth viewing if only because his personality is so flagrantly absent. Yet he is and always shall be known as the man who directed theGodfatherfilms, a series that has dominated and defined their creator in a way perhaps no other director can understand. Coppola has never been able to leave them alone, whether returning after 15 years to make a trilogy of the diptych, or re-editing the first two films into chronological order for a separate video release asThe Godfather Saga. The films are our very own Shakespearean cycle: they tell a tale of a vicious mobster and his extended personal and professional families (once the stuff of righteous moral comeuppance), and they dared to present themselves with an epic sweep and an unapologetically tragic tone. Murder, it turned out, was a serious business. The first film remains a towering achievement, brilliantly cast and conceived. The entry of Michael Corleone into the family business, the transition of power from his father, the ruthless dispatch of his enemies--all this is told with an assurance that is breathtaking to behold. And it turned out to be merely prologue; two years laterThe Godfather, Part IIbalanced Michael's ever-greater acquisition of power and influence during the fall of Cuba with the story of his father's own youthful rise from immigrant slums.

Unbeknownst to them, the kids are working on a weapons system that the prof plans on selling to the government. The star student, and chief rabble-rouser, is played by Kilmer, in good early form as a cocky genius who hasn't lost touch with his goofy side.

{"description": "This absolutely charming, wholly engaging romantic comedy is the hidden gem of the four collaborations of Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant. Most everyone's seenThe Philadelphia Story, but few know of this unorthodox, hilarious comedy of life among the rich and privileged, though both were Broadway hits by playwright Philip Barry. Grant plays the happy-go-lucky Johnny Case, a self-made man with a dream in his heart of making just enough money to retire on and then traveling around the world. Johnny proposes to the lovely Julia (Doris Nolan) in Lake Placid, but it isn't until he comes to pay her a visit in New York that he discovers she's the daughter of a wealthy industrialist. Although his nonconformity ruffles the feathers of Julia's stuffy father, he's soon won over the whole family--most notably, Julia's rebellious sister Linda (Hepburn), who in becoming Johnny's greatest advocate finds herself irresistibly drawn to him. There's more going on here than a spiffy, surface romance, with Johnny's free-spirit determination going up against rock-hard establishment values, and director George Cukor plays up the social politics of the story just as well as the wonderful, exquisite romance. Hepburn and Grant, as always, are perfectly paired, and given able support by Lew Ayres as the black sheep of Hepburn's family, and Edward Everett Horton and Jean Dixon as Grant's longtime pals. Filmed previously in 1930; Hepburn understudied the role of Linda on Broadway and used a scene from the play in her first screen test.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000040EO", "6302990076", "630150528X", "0792839846", "6302227127", "6304383177", "0782006779", "6302305950", "630310245X", "6302208920", "6303102441", "6301278437", "6304525125", "6302798434", "6301328531", "B000PYKZYC", "6304056958", "6303333079", "6302725542", "0792840836", "B0000049FG", "6302484448", "6301973267", "0790744759", "6301987845", "1559838450", "B006P0UQ2G", "630266232X", "630299005X", "6301964012", "6303364772", "0783215096", "6301670140", "B00005LMA7", "6304111398", "6302011035", "6301798503", "0792837630", "6301967410", "0792837649"], "also_viewed": ["B008D1Q1VU", "B000A8AX6I"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 332020}, "asin": "630290899X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510FZJEFSHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Holiday [VHS]"}

{"description": "This step workout is broken into three segments for different levels of stamina and complexity. You can do just level 1 (12 minutes) or continue through level 2, for 22 minutes, or through level 3, for 32 minutes. Within each segment, Keli Roberts's assistants demonstrate different intensities, so you can work at your own pace as you build endurance. Roberts instructs well, with plenty of safety and alignment tips, and she repeats the combinations enough for you to get them. But the camera has an annoying habit of changing angles when she first introduces a new pattern, which is just when you want to keep watching her feet. Advanced exercisers will add some propulsion moves, such as jumping onto the step. After the step workout and stretch, you get 8 minutes of killer abdominals, and finally a calming, guided relaxation. Roberts is a celebrity trainer, and you can see why from the professional way she instructs this video--and from the to-die-for body that must motivate her clients!--Joan Price", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 198394}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "title": "Keli Roberts - Ultimate Step Workout [VHS]", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302208661", "6302967953", "B0009GV9RI", "6302561760", "B004X167PO", "6302431832", "B000A3DGG2", "B006RH3QQ0", "1573309850"], "also_viewed": ["B0009GV9RI", "6302208661", "B006RH3QQ0", "B000I5X4SM", "B000LC3IOC", "6302967953", "B004W060ZS", "B00FICSCGE", "6302561760", "B000FS9FMQ", "B00GPL0LBG", "6303284302", "B0009WIY48", "1573309966", "B004X167PO", "B000NO2D3A", "B000ASDG12", "B005XMICHI", "B006RH3QPQ", "B000IVQALO", "B000B5SCAO", "B005MVUHSW", "B00FICVD60"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21QPWF0051L.jpg", "asin": "6302967945"}

{"description": "A perfect marriage of novel but incisive writing, acting, and direction,Bigis the story of a 12-year-old boy who wishes he were older, and wakes up one morning as a 30-year-old man (Tom Hanks). The script by Gary Ross (Dave) and Anne Spielberg finds some unexpected ways of attacking obvious issues of sex, work, and childhood friendships, and in all of these things the accent is on classy humor and great sensitivity. Hanks is remarkable in the lead, at times hilarious (reacting to caviar just as a 12-year-old would) and at others deeply tender. Penny Marshall became a first-rate filmmaker with this 1988 work.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301578805", "6300214753", "6302936381", "6301569385", "6303049079", "B00000JS61", "6301666569", "6301179552", "630179513X", "6304718551", "6300989003", "6303212379", "B00006G8LB", "6302824729", "6300213668", "B00004TWZK", "6302581907", "6300184269", "0792839129", "6302453356", "B00007E2F6", "6300182916", "630596260X", "0790742322", "6303148387", "B00006AL1C", "6300214370", "B0000YTP0C", "6301157141", "6301763041", "0792837207", "6305177473", "6303236863", "6301404440", "0783219458", "0788809806", "B00005LL26", "6302091632", "6301963911", "6304501668", "B00000490M", "0788812424", "6303409997", "0790705141", "B0002F6BQU", "6304737491", "6302481805", "078880782X", "6302968143", "6304039174"], "bought_together": ["6301578805", "6301569385"], "also_viewed": ["6301796535", "0790742322", "6301792734", "6302877881", "6304718551", "6302516986", "0767825411", "6301697308", "6303212395", "6303212379", "6301157141", "6301398912", "6304233639", "B00000490M", "6302091632", "6300214753", "6300214400", "6300213730", "6302518393", "630021463X", "6300214540", "6300214710", "6303257844", "B0000633ZP", "0783219733", "B00JVLGL2A", "6300275213", "B0006OBPTA", "B000P0J0A6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 254313}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.99, "brand": "BIG TOM HANKS", "asin": "630339406X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VR9PX6SYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Big [VHS]"}
{"description": "\"Supernatural\" is still available as a videotape because it stars Carole Lombard, but you will appreciate it more if you focus more on director Victor Halperin, whose previous film had been \"White Zombie.\" We begin with the slimy Paul Bavian (Alan Dinehart), a fake spirtualist who wants to get his hands on the Courtney family fortune. Towards that end he tells young Roma Courtney (Lombard) that he is in communication with her dead brother, John (Lyman Williams). Bavian arranges a seance using his landlay, Madame Gourjan (Beryle Mercer) and uses a mask of John's face to convince Roma that her brother, reaching out from beyond the grave and tries to convince her that John was murdered by Robert Hammond (William Farnum), Roma's legal guardian. Of course, Roma is upset by this news and does not know what to do. Meanwhile, in another part of town, we meet Dr. Houston (H. B. Warner), a psychologist who believes that the spirits of dead criminals can enter the bodies of the living and continue to commit crimes. To prove his theory, the doctor has made arrangements with Ruth Rogen, the \"Greenwich Village love-murderess\" who is about to be executed for the murder of three of her lovers, to perform experiments on her body when she is dead. Ruth has agreed because she wants to take revenge from beyond the grave on Bavian, who is the one who betrayed her to the police.", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 310297}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Supernatural [VHS]", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B000E6ESWG", "B001O2SH1W", "B000QTD6QA", "B000N3T0FK", "B000I2JDF8", "B002IREXI8", "B0047T7KI0", "B00B5LDTPQ", "B000TGKWPS"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F0ZX2AFSL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "6303560121"}

{"description": "Death has never stopped anyone from crafting a sequel to a successful film, but Terence Fisher and screenwriter Jimmy Sangster rather ingeniously twist the climactic execution ofThe Curse of Frankensteininto the opening ofThe Revenge of Frankenstein. With a cold-blooded flourish that would become his trademark, Frankenstein plots his escape and sends an innocent (a priest, no less) to take his place on the guillotine, leaving himself free to continue his experiments. As the new head of a hospital for the poor, he builds a body for his crippled assistant from parts amputated from his patients, but body battles mind for supremacy and turns the newly ambulatory man into a bloodthirsty cannibal. Once again Fisher makes the most of a constricted budget, turning his poorhouse hospital into a cramped, dank hole and splurging on another colorful laboratory of buzzing devices and a centerpiece tank for his suspended creature. There are few innocents in the Frankenstein films and this is no different: high-society dandies are hypocrites, poorhouse patients thieves and opportunists, and of course the driven doctor is willing to sacrifice anything and anyone to achieve his goal. The clever conclusion, which lays the groundwork for the next sequel, was curiously ignored when the third installment finally arrived six years later inThe Evil of Frankenstein.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302814669"], "also_viewed": ["6302814669"]}, "price": 2.83, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 564061}, "asin": "6303637469", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ASCZNFTRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Revenge of Frankenstein [VHS]"}
{"description": "A young Paris housewife, S&eacute;verine, grows bored with her stable husband. When she learns of the presence of a high-class brothel in her neighborhood, she quietly goes to work there--but only during the day, until five o'clock in the afternoon. This sublime 1967 film is one of the latter-day masterpieces of the Spanish-born director Luis Bu&ntilde;uel, whose career forms one of the greatest and boldest arcs in cinema. By the time ofBelle de jour, Bu&ntilde;uel had become almost completely deadpan in his style, which not only leaves the motivation of S&eacute;verine a mystery (despite a few flashbacks to degradations of her youth), but also casts the entire plot in doubt. An old surrealist from the 1920s (when his first classic,Un chien andalou, was made in collaboration with Salvador Dali), Bu&ntilde;uel suggests that what we see may be real, or simply S&eacute;verine's imagination. Because he was the least pretentious of directors, Bu&ntilde;uel keeps his material playful, wicked, yet cutting. As S&eacute;verine, the impossibly lovely Catherine Deneuve uses her cool demeanor to great effect--she never breaks her deadpan, either. In 1995, after having been out of official circulation for years,Belle de Jourwas re-released in America and became an unexpected art-house hit.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301442768", "6305372594", "6300208591", "6301966015"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 355577}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6303855490", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JX1GRW6RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Belle De Jour [VHS]"}
{"description": "This stylish combination of expressionistic horror and deadpan black comedy centers on the activities of a beautiful female vampire on the streets of New York City. Playing fast and loose with the Dracula legend, the film examines the legendary count's children, particularly the alluring and mysterious Nadja (Elina Lowensohn). At the film's beginning, Nadja is celebrating her father's demise and hoping to begin a new life. She hopes that this life will include Lucy (Galaxy Craze), a spunky young woman that she seduces after an encounter in a New York bar. Unfortunately, Lucy is already married, to the nephew of eccentric vampire hunter Van Helsing (Peter Fonda), who disposed of Nadja's father and has now set his sights on capturing the daughter. Matters are further complicated when Nadja's brother Edgar (Jared Harris), a vampire who wishes to give up his blood-sucking nature, also becomes involved. Gorgeously shot by cinematographer Jim Denault in a mixture of 35mm black-and-white and low-budget Pixelvision video, the film resembles a combination of the surrealist visions of co-producer David Lynch and the quirky humor and stylized sensibility of Hal Hartley. The convoluted narrative sometimes fails to gel, and the self-conscious, arty approach will not appeal to audiences looking for conventional thrills, but those with a taste for the unusual may find the film an appealing contemporary spin on a familiar legend.", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 595306}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6303924832", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/410QN5FKZKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Nadja [VHS]"}

This time Bond gets mad after a close friend (David Hedison) from the intelligence sector is assassinated on his wedding day, and 007 goes undercover to link the murder to an international drug cartel. Robert Davi makes an interesting adversary, but as with most of the Bond films in the '70s, '80s, and '90s--and especially since the end of the cold war--one has to wonder why we should still care about these lesser villains and their unimaginative crimes.

At that point, while riding the middling success of her TV series, it probably seemed like a good career move to make this increasingly desperate film. She plays Martha, a TV producer in her 30s who is under pressure from both her parents and friends to find the right guy. Then, by accident, she stumbles across Whitman (Bill Pullman), who seems like the ultimate dreamboat: handsome, sensitive, and thoughtful. But his flaws become quickly apparent, and when she tries to break it off, he becomes a stalker. DeGeneres has some funny material early on, then must settle for reacting to Pullman's bizarre behavior. Pullman often is funnier than his costar but neither of them is particularly well served by the cobbled-together script and the generic direction of Nick Castle.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303354939"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 389668}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6304106025", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZWHEVC0VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mr Wrong [VHS]"}

{"description": "Having developed his skill as a master of contemporary crime drama, writer-director Michael Mann displayed every aspect of that mastery in this intelligent, character-driven thriller from 1995, which also marked the first onscreen pairing of Robert De&nbsp;Niro and Al Pacino. The two great actors had played father and son in the separate time periods ofThe Godfather, Part&nbsp;II, but this was the first film in which the pair appeared together, and although their only scene together is brief, it's the riveting fulcrum of this high-tech cops-and-robbers scenario. De&nbsp;Niro plays a master thief with highly skilled partners (Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore) whose latest heist draws the attention of Pacino, playing a seasoned Los Angeles detective whose investigation reveals that cop and criminal lead similar lives. Both are so devoted to their professions that their personal lives are a disaster. Pacino's with a wife (Diane Venora) who cheats to avoid the reality of their desolate marriage; De&nbsp;Niro pays the price for a life with no outside connections; and Kilmer's wife (Ashley Judd) has all but given up hope that her husband will quit his criminal career. These are men obsessed, and as De&nbsp;Niro and Pacino know, they'll both do whatever's necessary to bring the other down. Mann's brilliant screenplay explores these personal obsessions and sacrifices with absorbing insight, and the tension mounts with some of the most riveting action sequences ever filmed--most notably a daylight siege that turns downtown Los Angeles into a virtual war zone of automatic gunfire. At nearly three hours, the film qualifies as a kind of intimate epic, certain to leave some viewers impatiently waiting for more action, but it's all part of Mann's compelling strategy.Heatis a true rarity: a crime thriller with equal measures of intense excitement and dramatic depth, giving De&nbsp;Niro and Pacino a prime showcase for their finely matched talents.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000003KHS", "6300183211", "B00000IO4G", "630018627X", "6303421563", "B00000JGEI", "6302415853", "630018403X", "0800199421", "6304258984", "0784011923", "6304259131", "6302482712", "6303953425", "B00007CVYA", "0783223218", "6300214540", "6302054982", "0790731274", "B00000ILE6", "0792147618", "079073799X", "6301208773", "6301888901", "0790701251", "0792133153", "6302378648", "6302282535", "6305718792", "6304414099", "6303696813", "0790748169", "B0002ZDVFE", "B000077VT7", "6303269834", "6302516919", "630428649X", "B00008R9K9", "6303036570", "6302814782", "0792116887", "0792158261", "0790705141", "6304508611", "6301071379", "B00005Q4GY", "076783819X", "6300214567", "6303020089", "6303383300", "6302945089", "B0002GTWOM", "B00003CXE6", "0792841778", "6301797930", "0800116917", "0800179552", "B0000040EJ", "B00005A7VC", "6300182878"], "also_viewed": ["B000003KHS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 286071}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.98, "brand": "", "asin": "6304214502", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4160ZFH45VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Heat [VHS]"}
{"description": "They call itGiantbecause everything in this picture is big, from the generous running time (more than 200 minutes) to the sprawling ranch location (a horizon-to-horizon plain with a lonely, modest mansion dropped in the middle) to the high-powered stars. Stocky Rock Hudson stars as the confident, stubborn young ranch baron Bick Benedict, who woos and wins the hand of Southern belle Elizabeth Taylor, a seemingly demure young beauty who proves to be Hudson's match after she settles into the family homestead. For many the film is chiefly remembered for James Dean's final performance, as poor former ranch hand Jett Rink, who strikes oil and transforms himself into a flamboyant millionaire playboy. Director George Stevens won his second Oscar for this ambitious, grandly realized (if sometimes slow moving) epic of the changing socioeconomic (and physical) landscape of modern Texas, based on Edna Ferber's bestselling novel. The talented supporting cast includes Mercedes McCambridge as Bick's frustrated sister, put out by the new \"woman of the house\"; Chill Wills as the Benedicts' garrulous rancher neighbor; Carroll Baker and Dennis Hopper as the Benedicts' rebellious children; and Earl Holliman and Sal Mineo as dedicated ranch hands.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000059HH1", "6302797616", "6305123616", "1569942072", "B000005PPB", "6300182371", "6300215830", "B000006FKX", "6301045750", "B00068S41I", "0792107683", "6300183890", "B000A1KF8Q", "6301599225", "B000054OW2", "6300215644", "B00004TX2D", "6302655897", "0767825616", "6301976622", "0792839129", "B00005A1VH"], "bought_together": ["6302797616", "B000059HH1"], "also_viewed": ["B004XKVP7K", "B0007TKNK6", "B0000040EJ", "B0000068ZQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 221648}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.98, "brand": "", "asin": "6304239149", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MN3CNVQYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Giant (Special Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "The burning intensity of Russell Crowe (L.A. Confidential) first  lit up screens as a hate-filled,Mein Kampf-spouting skinhead in this brutal Australian drama. Crowe glowers from under his deep-set eyes as Hando, the creepy but charismatic leader of a racist gang who declares war on the Asian immigrants pouring into Melbourne. His rage erupts in violent attacks on the local Vietnamese community, but when his victims fight back his gang breaks up, and Hando flees the city with his best buddy Davey (Daniel Pollock) and redheaded hellion Gabe (Jacqueline McKenzie), a rich girl runaway who turns the dynamic duo into a splintered love triangle. Writer-director Geoffrey Wright's matter-of-fact treatment of this subculture eschews social commentary for visceral immediacy. His portrait of white supremacist punks living like squatters on the fringes of Australian society is powered by coiled anger and simmering frustration, which finds its outlet in brutal fights and murderous rampages (the intense violence earned the film an NC-17 rating). The lack of moral position may bother some people, especially in light of Wright's sympathetic treatment of particular members of Hando's racist army, and the cold, hate-driven violence is sometimes hard to watch, but his vivid characters and richly drawn world create a compelling drama for adventurous filmgoers.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 551223}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6304431848", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510RV14D60L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Romper Stomper [VHS]"}

{"description": "John Frankenheimer's follow-up toThe Manchurian Candidateis as intimate and subdued as its predecessor is flamboyant and energetic. Burt Lancaster is calm and calculating as the steely-eyed military hawk General Scott, who opposes the president's (Fredric March) plan to end the cold war with a bold nuclear disarmament plan. Lancaster's longtime friend and frequent costar Kirk Douglas is his smiling, joking right-hand man, Colonel \"Jiggs\" Casey, whose easygoing manner is jolted by evidence of a possible plot to overthrow the American government. Scripted by Rod Serling from the novel by Fletcher Knebel and Charles W. Bailey, the film plays much like a classic live TV drama (the medium that spawned both Frankenheimer and Serling), with the drama arising from conversations and confrontations and the action largely limited to scenes within the Pentagon and the White House. An ominous undercurrent of danger seeps through the realistic (and often real) settings of the film, conveyed chiefly through the intensity of the excellent ensemble performances. Notable among the supporting cast are Ava Gardner as a lonely Washington socialite who was once the general's mistress, Edmond O'Brien as an amiable alcoholic senator, Martin Balsam as the president's shrewd but skeptical secretary, and underrated character actor George Macready as the wily presidential advisor.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000408I", "B00005JMA5", "6304111398", "B00004XPPE", "B0001NBMH6", "B000055Y0X", "6300268047", "6303686745", "6300181405", "0792133153", "6302990076", "630396155X"], "bought_together": ["B00000408I"], "also_viewed": ["B00005JMA5"]}, "price": 29.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 333013}, "asin": "6304457391", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B1EQE5ZKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Seven Days in May [VHS]"}

One of the most intelligently paranoid science fiction films ever produced, this pessimistic masterpiece functions as a dark flip side to the relatively optimistic alien-induced evolution theory presented in the later2001: A Space Odyssey. Nigel Kneale's brilliant script (which posits a surprisingly plausible, otherworldly rationale for the existence of the supernatural) was later appropriated by acknowledged fan John Carpenter for his underratedPrince of Darkness. In addition to boasting a flawless widescreen print, this marvelous tape also features a hilariously overdone original U.S. trailer (\"Women will be defiled by the invaders from outer space!\" it erroneously shrieks).

{"description": "After the tight plotting and quirky intensity ofFargo, this casually amusing follow-up from the prolifically inventive Coen (Ethan and Joel) brothers seems like a bit of a lark, and the result was a box-office disappointment. The good news is,The Big Lebowskiis every bit a Coen movie, and its lazy plot is part of its laidback charm. After all, how many movies can claim as their hero a pot-bellied, pot-smoking loser named Jeff \"The Dude\" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) who spends most of his time bowling and getting stoned? And where else could you find a hairnetted Latino bowler named Jesus (John Turturro) who sports dazzling purple footgear, or an erotic artist (Julianne Moore) whose creativity consists of covering her naked body in paint, flying through the air in a leather harness, and splatting herself against a giant canvas? Who else but the Coens would think of showing you a camera view from inside the holes of a bowling ball, or an elaborate Busby Berkely-styled musical dream sequence involving a Viking goddess and giant bowling pins? The plot--which finds Lebowski involved in a kidnapping scheme after he's mistaken for a rich guy with the same name--is almost beside the point. What counts here is a steady cascade of hilarious dialogue, great work from Coen regulars John Goodman and Steve Buscemi, and the kind of cinematic ingenuity that puts the Coens in a class all their own. Be sure to watch with snacks in hand, becauseThe Big Lebowskimight give you a giddy case of the munchies.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783228317", "0792845684", "B000056V73", "B000059HCI", "B0002G2B2W", "6305123616", "0792839846", "6304078145", "6302610702", "6304340648", "6301666569", "6302516986", "0790705141", "6303953425", "6300214753", "6305499365", "B00005ATQA", "630268644X", "6301578805", "6301627768", "6300184064", "0790734079", "6303454089", "6302941318", "6302054982", "1558807381"], "also_viewed": ["B0002G2B2W", "0783228317", "6304297912"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 212775}, "asin": "6304994540", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WB1EBQW6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Big Lebowski [VHS]"}
{"description": "The curiosity of Quentin Tarantino'sJackie Brownis Robert Forster's worldly wise bail bondsman Max Cherry, the most alive character in this adaptation of Elmore Leonard'sRum Punch. The Academy Awards saw it the same way, giving Forster the film's only nomination. The film is more \"rum\" than \"punch\" and will certainly disappoint those who are looking for Tarantino's trademark style. This movie is a slow, decaffeinated story of six characters glued to a half million dollars brought illegally into the country. The money belongs to Ordell (Samuel&nbsp;L. Jackson), a gunrunner just bright enough to control his universe and do his own dirty work. His just-paroled friend--a loose term with Ordell--Louis (Robert De Niro) is just taking up space and could be interested in the money. However, his loyalties are in question between his old partner and Ordell's doped-up girl (Bridget Fonda). Certainly Fed Ray Nicolette (Michael Keaton) wants to arrest Ordell with the illegal money. The key is the title character, a late-40s-ish flight attendant (Pam Grier) who can pull her own weight and soon has both sides believing she's working for them. The end result is rarely in doubt, and what is left is two hours of Tarantino's expert dialogue as he moves his characters around town.Tarantino changed the race of Jackie and Ordell, a move that means little except that it allows Tarantino to heap on black culture and language, something he has a gift and passion for. He said this film is for an older audience although the language and drug use may put them off. The film is not a salute to Grier's blaxploitation films beyond the musical score. Unexpectedly the most fascinating scenes are between Grier and Forster: two neo-stars glowing in the limelight of their first major Hollywood film after decades of work.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000X81ZI", "6303953425", "B00006G8O1", "B000286RJI", "6304106017", "B000067DGJ", "6305095566", "B0000633ZP", "6302968100", "6302816580", "B000056V73", "630504077X", "630300394X"], "bought_together": ["B0000X81ZI"], "also_viewed": ["B009B0OG1O", "630268644X", "6300183211"]}, "price": 9.85, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 236793}, "asin": "6305006598", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71GXP626B7L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Jackie Brown [VHS]"}
{"description": "Matineeoffers one of the best matches of director and screenplay that you're ever likely to find. Raised on a steady diet of 1950s monster movies, Joe Dante later contributed to the genre with such films asGremlinsandExplorers, but it was Charlie Haas's script forMatineethat gave Dante a perfect platform for comedy, dramatic context, and nostalgic homage. Set in Florida during the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, the movie focuses on a schlock-movie promoter named Woolsey (inspired by real-life producer William Castle and played to perfection by John Goodman) who arrives in Key West with his latest Grade-Z extravaganza,Mant, about the raving half-man/half-ant product of \"science run amuck.\" (This movie-within-a-movie is a perfect tribute by Dante, who cast B-movie stalwarts in the kind of roles they'd built careers on.)Balancing youthful exuberance with the ominous threat of nuclear attack, Dante finds his alter ego in Simon Fenton, who plays a 15-year-old captivated by Woolsey's cheesy showmanship. This affectionate devotion is matched by Dante, who captures the anxiety of the missile crisis even asMatineedelivers an abundance of humor. Director John Sayles and Dante-movie veteran Dick Miller have cameos as Woolsey's show-biz accomplices, and Cathy Moriarty is brilliant as Woolsey's wisecracking mistress and Z-movie queen. All of this makesMatineea polished gem that's sweetly entertaining while staying true to the serious context of its story. It's the movie Joe Dante was born to direct.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000WN0SM", "B00K6D1R0I", "B00KUS5YGC", "B00441GYQ0", "B00E1HIWXU", "B00K6D1S7A", "B00KB614HQ", "B0000648ZQ", "B00000K3U3", "B00FUABK36", "B008LFYXDG", "B00GPPXNLC", "B00IO998U2", "B0000694WH", "B00005K3OV", "B000FWHW8Q", "B00L326LTI", "B00I099JZK", "B00DTECHWS", "B00ISSF7S6", "B00I3C1T1Q", "B000K7VHTQ", "B003THSXKU", "B0045HCJRG", "B00HRJVHKE", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B000FVQLKM", "B00GBT61YS", "1613778457", "B00008973H", "B001B9ZVVC", "B00K6J7FGC", "3901644520", "B00005LC4D", "B00BTYSIWI", "B000FFJZO2", "B00009PY45", "B0045HCJKS", "B000RXVNDI", "B00FUABHVQ", "078321958X", "B00AEFXPG2", "B00000IQC4", "B00I462XNO", "B00K6J7Q6G", "0792846060", "B00FM4S5O2", "B000FVQLKW", "B00CDEJRDC", "B000035Z38", "B0088EDONK", "B00I3C1T6G", "0991127900", "B00D9EJFZA", "B001NKWLBW", "B00BXRVQO8", "B0009X770E", "B001Q8MMCE", "B000CCW2UW", "B005STRKC4", "B00JJOY41E", "B000063UR3", "6305428514", "B002I41KNC", "B004Z1HY36", "B00IELX0C2"], "bought_together": ["B0000WN0SM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AMDA2O4", "B0000WN0SM", "B00009AOAX", "B000067FP8"]}, "price": 37.9, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 347038}, "asin": "6305080453", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61M2PDWCASL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Matinee"}
{"description": "David O. Selznick wantedGone with the Windto be somehow more than a movie, a film that would broaden the very idea of what a film could be and do and look like. In many respects he got what he worked so hard to achieve in this 1939 epic (and all-time box-office champ in terms of tickets sold), and in some respects he fell far short of the goal. While the first half of this Civil War drama is taut and suspenseful and nostalgic, the second is ramshackle and arbitrary. But there's no question that the film is an enormous achievement in terms of its every resource--art direction, color, sound, cinematography--being pushed to new limits for the greater glory of telling an American story as fully as possible. Vivien Leigh is still magnificently narcissistic, Olivia de Havilland angelic and lovely, Leslie Howard reckless and aristocratic. As for Clark Gable: we're talking one of the most vital, masculine performances ever committed to film.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304117752", "0792839846", "6304178352", "630150528X", "6303215734", "B00000JS61", "0792151712", "0783222955", "0800116917", "6304151306", "630233683X", "6300183513", "0783221347", "6303494390", "B0000040EJ", "6302150620", "6300215814", "6301586026", "B00000F6D1", "6304274742", "6300215741", "0783235593", "B000056BRF", "6300215830", "6304400551", "6304239149", "6300185095", "6305282927", "0788806270", "6300207919", "6300213668", "6300181340", "6302610702", "5559477621", "6303854311", "B000059HH1", "6304039530", "0800100832", "B00004TYS8", "B00000JKNP", "B0000040EO", "6302936381", "6302227127", "6300215695", "6304039506", "6304994540", "6300277089", "6305576173", "630428635X", "6303020089", "B00005RRG3", "6301975987", "0783235607", "6301628454", "6300270971", "6303637574", "6300215628", "6304359705", "6304119046", "0792837207", "1558807780", "6300181987", "0783236352", "630251018X", "6302413435", "6303057225", "6301650514", "6304457316", "6300215512", "6301976061", "0800124693", "B000M7BEPQ", "B000005PPB", "630197350X", "6301976924", "0792837576", "B003UPPO2G", "6300267857", "B00005A1VG", "6301976983", "0790733897", "B00004RV8M", "6303651488", "6301969294", "6302241189", "6300246868", "B00000I1EM", "B0001E7LQG", "B00000F3QZ", "6303364772", "6303562248", "6304196954", "B00000FZCU", "6302640504", "6302360978", "0790733935", "6300181421", "6302484405", "6305718792"], "bought_together": ["6304117752", "6304178352"], "also_viewed": ["1451635621", "6304117752", "0792839846", "6304178352", "0800116917", "0792151712", "6304274742", "6304151306", "6303215734", "630233683X", "6304119046", "B00000JS61", "155890641X", "6305363668", "6304539258", "630018403X", "B002YZFBXA", "6302526574", "6300215598", "6300213668", "6301976983", "B0046ZE3LC", "6300215830", "0790743213", "6300182207", "6300181529", "B00000JGEI", "1558807780", "0792839129", "6304500831", "6304429274", "0784011923", "630150528X", "6304400225", "B00001IVED", "6300215717", "0788812408", "B00B7K0JZS", "0767825411", "B0000040EK", "B0000040EO", "0792158261", "B00008EYA5", "630141277X", "0800124693", "6302054982", "6303506291", "0783222955", "6300183211", "6300215814", "0790742322", "B00000JKNP", "B0000AM6IY", "B0000AQZYM", "0783216084", "6303402070", "6301797906", "630281622X", "6302961572"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 168297}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6305123616", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZGXJP009L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gone With the Wind [VHS]"}
{"description": "There was a time beforeLawrence of ArabiaandDoctor Zhivagowhen David Lean made smaller, more effortlessly picturesque movies, and this splendid Venetian travelogue and love story is one of them--the last, actually, before the epic onslaught started with the Oscar-winningThe Bridge on the River Kwaiin 1957. \"Sometimes I think a schedule in Venice is just, well, all wrong,\" observes a bewitched tourist to Katharine Hepburn's vacationing spinster near the beginning ofSummertime, which is based on Arthur Laurents's playThe Time of the Cuckoo. Before the end, however, Jane will have thrown her idealized romantic notions into the canals and embarked on a passionate affair with a married art dealer (Rossano Brazzi). More blissful than Lean's adulterous fableBrief Encounter10 years prior, but not entirely guilt- or pain-free, this deceptively simple romance is an often-fascinating glimpse at a time when sexual revolution for Americans--and especially middle-aged women--was confined to fanciful European trysts. Plus, with all the architecture, art, Italian conversation, music, and fine cuisine around you (all richly photographed on location by Jack Hildyard), who's to pish-posh a furtive all-nighter between one repressive country and a free-loving one? The two leads are graceful and even musical in their movements and line deliveries. Hepburn's initial outrage at the idea that illicit love is part of her impossibly beautiful surroundings may at first seem outdated, but the Academy Award-winning actress is too good not to suggest as well the poignant, deep fear her character has of opening up emotionally to anybody. Ultimately,Summertimeis the movie equivalent of a deep, satisfying sigh.--Robert Abele", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002B15Y2", "B005SYZZ9E", "B001QYOY3S", "B00AMEZDK6", "B003VA3JTK", "B00AJCUL0I", "B004K4FUT8", "B0035ECHIG", "B001HSNTKW", "B000ION7AI", "0788815490", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B00AEFXD1O", "B000085OY1", "B004SIP7D0", "B006H37P2K", "B004IK30KA", "B0001DCYUU", "B00004TWZH", "B000056HEA", "B004A8ZWSS", "B000069I0A", "B0042ZEEI8", "B00JX3SHIC", "B004CIIXDC", "B000JU8HBA", "B00871C09S", "B000G6L0EI", "B00KMULA9I", "B00007L4MV", "B004K4FUMK", "B00K6I8QZ2", "B000NJXG68", "B0002T2Q6U", "B008FYZIEQ", "B002XDR5P0", "B00003Q433", "630560097X", "B008SAPCAM", "B00005JKF6", "B0008ENIKM", "B00005Y6XU", "B00IO8UO74", "B00005AUK7", "B00KE3B6NI", "B000KGGJ1I", "B0009S4IH4", "B000I0RNV6", "B001GUYAZY", "B00007CVS4", "B000055XM8", "B002TSAAME", "B009NUHP24", "B00AEBB8SS", "B00005BH23", "B00005JH9B", "B000EDWKXI", "B000244ENS", "B00JPUUSEE", "B00J2TE3DU", "B000MGBLHS", "B001BSBBDK", "B005CFBZX4", "B00000F17A", "B001KXZGNW", "B006TTC5WC", "B0012GVMIA", "B00005JKGO", "B001LMU1A0", "B00005JKGX", "B00AEBB97S", "B001LMU19G", "B005SYZYYA", "B000068QJP", "B00K8CQ1Q2", "B005DI9906", "B003VA3JW2", "B00049QQJQ", "B00J2TCHP6", "B001D8W7EK", "B001PO54V0", "B000QJMDH8", "B001LPWGGY", "B00011D1OU", "B00005ALMH", "B00003CX8N", "B000056KMW", "B0007M222A", "B0006FO8M0", "B001HSNTGQ", "B004K4FUK2", "B0087ZG7R0", "B00005BCK0", "B000B8384Q", "B002IC1ETY", "B00JK32362", "B00008ZZ9J", "B00000IOKV", "B00KGLS050", "B007N5YK10"], "bought_together": ["B0002B15Y2", "B00AMEZDK6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002B15Y2", "B00AMEZDK6", "B004K4FUT8", "630560097X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 49302}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 20.34, "brand": "", "asin": "6305094934", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZCCAFM71L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Summertime (The Criterion Collection)"}
{"description": "A little drunk on its own arcane exotica as a gambling movie,Roundersis a film that takes us inside a world of high-stakes card players but falls short on such essentials as character development, relationships, that sort of thing. Still, it is a real curiosity, written by a couple of guys (David Levien and Brian Koppelman) who appear to know something about the dark underbelly of card hustling for fun and profit. Matt Damon stars as a reluctant law student who can't put aside his subterranean career of playing poker and blackjack for big money. After he loses his post-grad nest egg to a weird Russian kingpin (John Malkovich)--and also loses his disgusted girlfriend (Gretchen Mol) in the process--Damon's character turns to an unreliable old buddy (Edward Norton) for a dangerous game of sharking wherever there happens to be a game underway: frat boys, cops, bad dudes, you name it. Norton appears to be living out every young actor's fantasy of re-creating Robert De Niro's prototypical head case in Martin Scorsese'sMean Streets, and while his performance is burdened by obvious quotation marks, his estimable talent still shines through. Damon's charm and intelligence bring some oomph to the curiously flat proceedings, and while his hushed, soul-bearing scenes with Martin Landau (as a law professor who takes a shine to the kid) seem gratuitous, they're still nice to watch. Behind all this is director John Dahl (Red Rock West), who is not exactly at the top of his game here but who brings his distinctive toughness to the crime-noir tone.--Tom Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 343634}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.18, "brand": "", "asin": "6305240655", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51565J9D9ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rounders [VHS]"}
{"description": "Kevin Costner's 1990 epic won a bundle of Oscars for a moving, engrossing story of a white soldier (Costner) who singlehandedly mans a post in the 1870 Dakotas, and becomes a part of the Lakota Sioux community who live nearby. The film may not be a masterpiece, but it is far more than the sum of good intentions. The characters are strong, the development of relationships is both ambitious and careful, the love story between Costner and Mary McDonnell's character is captivating. Only the third-act portrait of white intruders as morons feels overbearing, but even that leads to a terribly moving conclusion. Costner's direction is assured, the balance of action and intimacy is perfect--what more could anyone want outside of an unqualified masterpiece?--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005LAIIHG", "B004LWZW9W", "B0000TANUI", "B000E5N6LG", "B00005JN0T", "B0067EKYAY", "B004UXUX4Q", "B00AEFY0F2", "B0018PH3L0", "B005LAIHYU", "B00CWM58WY", "B005LAIGPA", "B00E8RKHWW", "B002VWNID6", "B00DV2MVWO", "B00004WG2F", "B005LAIHXQ", "B004HO6I4M", "B004EPZ034", "B004LWZW4M", "0767836359", "B00AEFXKUI", "6304711905", "B000A2WP7O", "B00A7MSQRK", "B000W1SZBS", "B005LAIIT4", "B00DL46ZN8", "B007REV4T8", "B0068FZ0O2", "B000P0J0EW", "B00004XPPG", "B00005221M", "0783225733", "B00AMSLDTM", "B003ASLJRC", "B005LAIGXW", "B00B83ROIE", "B005LAII2Q", "B0068FZ0GK", "B004LWZW8I", "B00005LOL0", "B00AEFY4CG", "B002GHHHHO", "B004LWZW5G", "B0000ACOXL", "B00BB67UNW", "6305128952", "6305212112", "B00AEFY5B6", "0783226810", "B000P0J0EM", "B00GICP7UW", "B0006N2EZ0", "B00003CXB5", "B00AAQHP66", "B007SPPANM", "B000GFRI4K", "B000A2WAQU", "B002O3Z4XE", "B002NZK5TQ", "B0010YSD8Q", "B00008IHAW", "B0000DIXDR", "B002U4UYYQ", "B004UOHNIY", "B003AWRMCE", "B000OV3CFA", "078324021X", "B00001ZWUS", "B004SIP7ZS", "B0000JBALO", "B00066FBQG", "0767817729", "B00AEBB9NM", "B00CWM5MDY", "B00B0U2SFE", "0800141601", "B002DHACT2", "6304698801", "B000XR9L50", "B00FFT19XS", "B0002WZTOI", "B000AQ6A9E", "B002VWNIBI", "B002O3Z510", "B0081FSMPG", "B001ECDVK4", "B00008G8M4", "6305428506", "B00AEBBA36", "0767803434", "B00158K0QU", "0792844874", "B00008G8LY", "B000MNOX94", "B0001HLVS2", "B00AEBB9IM", "B002NZK5UU", "B0001CCY7E"], "bought_together": ["B0000TANUI", "B0018PH3L0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFY0F2", "B00003CXRP", "B000W1SZBS", "B00003CX95"]}, "price": 27.85, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 319852}, "asin": "6305304750", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510K1SDVT9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dances with Wolves - DTS"}

{"description": "Special agent Cleopatra Jones (Tamara Dobson), six feet two inches of sinewy fighting fury clad in layers of runway chic fashions in bright rainbow colors, strolls up a sand dune and orders the destruction of a Turkish poppy field. Thousands of miles away, an L.A. drug lord named Mommy (Shelley Winters hamming it up with garish wigs and lecherous leers) screeches as her life blood burns away and lures Cleopatra stateside to plot her demise. A product of the \"blaxploitation\" explosion of low-budget thrillers featuring black heroes in the 1970s,Cleopatra Jonesmay not be  the best of the batch but revels in the most outrageous fashion sense. Cleo looks great in furs, pantsuits, ponchos, turbans--a new outfit every scene--and drives a sleek black Corvette with a personalized license plate: \"CLEO.\" It's a shame that the producers dropped the exotic potential of a globetrotting super-agent for an L.A.-bound gangster film, which is entertaining in a comic-book way but rarely reaches the energetic levels of the gritty Pam Grier action picturesCoffyandFoxy Brown. Bernie Casey is a role model of dignity and action as a neighborhood activist, and a garishly overdressed Antonio Fargas delivers a suitably flamboyant performance as Mommy's pusher Doodlebug.

{"description": "Billy Crystal plays Mickey, a basketball referee who has to accompany  his estranged father's body to France, where the old man requested to be buried with the other members of his D-Day platoon. Unfortunately for Mickey, the airline loses his body. Fortunately for Mickey, this leads him to meet Ellen (Debra Winger), an airline executive who takes personal charge of the case and even joins him at the funeral. A whirlwind Paris romance leads to marriage, but that's when the complications begin... The story of Mickey and Ellen's marriage is recounted by their friends (played by Joe Mantegna, Cynthia Stevenson, Julie Kavner, Richard Masur, John Spencer, and Cathy Moriarty) as they wait for Mickey and Ellen to arrive at a dinner party. And of course these friends have their own stories, which are played out in witty shorthand as they bicker about who's going to tell the next part of the Mickey/Ellen saga.Forget Parisis uneven (unsurprisingly, Winger is stronger in the dramatic sections and Crystal in the comic parts, a schism that takes its toll on their chemistry), but its best parts hold up, even if the whole is shaky. Plus, the movie's theme (that romantic memories aren't what makes a marriage work, you have to live in the present) is explored with conviction and tenderness.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008G7UF", "B000XJD33O", "B000063JDN", "B00008972Y", "6304584210", "B00158K0QU", "B000002HJL", "B001DB6J6Y", "B00005N89R", "0790742071", "B009SH5JS4", "B005MYEQ4U", "B0000A2ZO0", "B00009Y3PV", "6304907729", "B00006ZXSO", "B0062VL500", "B0045HCJ76", "B004SIP9RO", "B0000542C9", "B000YDBPAM", "6304765266", "B00008DDXA", "0792842162", "B0000AOV4I", "0790742454", "B000H5TH1Q", "B00BEIYGK2", "B000JYW5B4", "B00006ZXSN", "B00AEFYD2M", "B0045HCJGW", "B00441GYRO", "B000MRNWK6", "B000BNX3B4", "B00005JG6N", "B00009AOAZ", "B0045HCIYU", "6305692572", "0767811100", "0790732149", "B002U4UYZA", "B00441GYZQ", "B000ZM1MG4", "B00003CXP7", "B000EHRVOW", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00AYRIUOC", "B00005JNQA", "B000228EGS", "B002NZK5RI", "B0021L8UZS", "B000EOTW0Q", "B00008979P", "B00006ZXSL", "B00008AOWI", "0767802535", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00G15MDI0", "B00441GYPG", "B00AEFXIIW", "B0018BZEOC", "B000LXHK2C", "B000085OY1", "B000055Y0Y", "B00AEFXYOA", "B00003CXHG", "B003BZ58RQ", "B00005JL6I", "B00386EZKE", "B00020HAXI", "0792838068", "B00AZMFO6I", "B00AEBB97S", "B000RETOGU", "B00BN3DUVE", "B001ECDVK4", "B002ZG98FU", "B0038N9WKU", "B00709GTGS", "B002AT8K9W", "B00AEFXXMI", "B0016P8OAG", "B00005Y1UV", "0767810856", "B0068FZ0GK", "B0002US528", "B00441GYOM", "0783226772", "B000765IJK", "B000CCW2P2", "B00AEFY66U", "B0007OCG56", "B002LE8MGW", "B004SUDQ2W", "6305213283", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00000JGHK", "B00006FMUW", "B0033PSHDG"], "bought_together": ["B00008G7UF"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000U1ZV80", "B000HT389Y", "B000XJD33O", "B00008G7UF"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 47737}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 23.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00002ND79", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41R009YANBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Forget Paris"}

{"description": "Men of Honorpresents a great role model for younger viewers, yet it's rated R due to abundant use of theFword. With appropriate discretion, parents should allow their preteen and teenaged children to see this rousing if altogether conventional biopic inspired by the life of Carl Brashear. Played with gravity and gumption by Cuba Gooding Jr., Brashear was the first African American to become a master diver in the U.S. Navy, despite the lingering effects of segregation, opposition from Navy brass, and the amputation of his left leg following a tragic on-duty accident. Robert De Niro adds marquee value and salty bluster as Billy Sunday, the drunken, redneck (and fictionalized) Master Chief who watches, with gradual admiration, as Brashear attains his ultimate goal through sheer force of will.This is all quite uplifting on its surface, but in attempting to hit the requisite highlights of an inspiring biography, director George Tillman Jr. (Soul Food) reduces Brashear's achievement to a succession of clich&eacute;s, forcing Gooding and De Niro to battle sentiment with their noteworthy performances. As Sunday's neglected wife, Charlize Theron is completely extraneous; Hal Holbrook's diving-school commander is a ranting caricature; and newcomer Aunjanue Ellis barely registers as Brashear's wife (in part because their obligatory romance is handled with an utter lack of finesse). There's no question that Brashear's efforts are heroic and worthy of recognition, soMen of Honorserves its basic purpose. Still, one can't help but wonder if Brashear's story would be even more impressive with a more authentic treatment.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000KF0GWW", "B00005B6JZ", "B000F6IODE", "B00005JLRZ", "B00003CXGV", "6304765258", "1558908315", "B0007KIFGE", "B00319ECI8", "B00005JA9F", "B00125WAWS", "B0006L0L5C", "B000P0J0C4", "B000056VP4", "0790736411", "B000065U1N", "B005LAIGN2", "B00AEFYRP0", "B002NZK5VO", "B003ASLJOU", "B0002WZTOI", "B00005JPBO", "0790732238", "6305432317", "B00003CXHJ", "B00005N5S3", "B002VWNICM", "B002AT8K9W", "B002VECM6S", "B00067BCBI", "B00008EY60", "B00000G3PA", "B005LAIGYQ", "B00005JKTP", "B002D755AI", "B000095WW8", "B00AEFY5B6", "B0045HCJHQ", "B00AEFXOKO", "B00AEBB9NM", "B00003CXTG", "B000P0J0EM", "B00008K76U", "B00AEBBA36", "B00005JK8K", "B000KGGIZK", "0800177967", "B00026ZD04", "B000EXZFCQ", "B00003CXFV", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00004XPPG", "B004SIP7ZS", "0792159659", "B000E8QVWY", "B00005PJ8L", "B00AEFYENK", "B00005JLSB", "B00008L3S6", "B000P0J0CE", "B00001ZWUS", "B000P0J09C", "B0006GAOJA", "0451409744", "6304711891", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B00E8G5HZ0", "B002GHHHPQ", "B00441GZ1Y", "B000JYW5BE", "B00005Y1UX", "B001FB55L2", "0790730979", "0783226845", "0783240295", "B00004W221", "0783225733", "B00005JKWX", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B0045HCJ8K", "B00HLTD3ZW", "6305213305", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000SFOW8I", "B000EHSVSC", "B0006IIOHC", "B001QERPAC", "B000P0J0EW", "B004AOECXI", "0780631684", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B00096S49Y", "B0000542CK", "B000066HAS", "B000A2UBN4", "B0043X1FL8", "B00005JNQA", "B000059TFO", "B00003CXTM"], "bought_together": ["B000KF0GWW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CXRP", "B005LAIHXQ", "B00DV2MVWO", "B000KF0GWW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 125288}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.99, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B00003CXPP", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516WESMCF3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Men of Honor"}

{"description": "To callPearl Harbora throwback to old-time war movies is something of an understatement. Director Michael Bay's epic take on the bombing that brought the United States into World War II hijacks every war movie situation and clich&#xE9; (some affectionate, some stale) you've ever seen and gives them a shiny, glossy spin until the whole movie practically gleams. Planes glisten, water sparkles, trees beckon--and Bay's re-creation of the bombing itself, a 30-minute sequence that's tightly choreographed and amazingly photographed, sets the action movie bar up quite a few notches. And in updating the classic war film, Bay and screenwriter Randall Wallace (Braveheart) use that old plot standby, the love triangle--this time, it's between two pilots (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) and a nurse (Kate Beckinsale) who find themselves stationed at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, during what they thought would be a nice, sunny tour of duty. Then, of course, history intervened.For the first 90 minutes of the movie, Affleck and Beckinsale find a nice, appealing chemistry that plays on his strengths as a movie star and hers as a serious actress--he gives her glamour, she gives him smarts. Their truncated romance--the beginning of which is told in flashback so we can get right to the point where he has to leave her to go to England--works, thanks to their charm. They're no Kate and Leo fromTitanic(a strategy the film strives hard toward), but they're pretty darn adorable in their own right. Hartnett, as the not entirely unwelcome third wheel, squints bravely but makes only a slight dent in the film. Everyone else inPearl Harbor--from Cuba Gooding Jr.'s brave navy seaman to Jon Voight's able impersonation of FDR--is pretty much a glorified walk-on, taking a backseat to the pyrotechnics and action sequences that keep the three-hour film in fairly constant motion.

{"description": "Opposites attract in this love story for the younger set. Carlos is a straight-laced poor boy working his way toward a better life. Nicole is a rich girl with a wild streak who can't seem to stay out of trouble. Can it be that they're meant for each other? Yes, of course it can.Crazy/Beautifulfollows a familiar pattern--the two young lovers come from different worlds, and no one else understands them--but has a few intelligent wrinkles to the standard star-crossed plot. Nicole's dad, for example, actually likes Carlos and worries that Nicole will corrupt him. Kirsten Dunst and Jay Hernandez give assured performances as the young lovers, and the movie's message of tolerance comes across without being preachy. As teen love stories go, you could do far worse. Adults may be left cold byCrazy/Beautiful, but teens--especially those with a dramatic streak--will enjoy this well-intentioned romance.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00013RC2K", "B00AMEZDJW", "B000087F7E", "B00DW5IKYS", "B00008G7UG", "B00447L4KA", "B00441GYVK", "B0000524E5", "B00005JKJS", "B005Z9MFRC", "B004SIP9X8", "B000083C6I", "078322933X", "B00DMDE02Q", "B00003CXGJ", "B000P0J0DS", "B00004Y2R1", "B00003CXMP", "B0071HPP3M", "B000J3OTSM", "B00000F0AD", "B00002SSKI", "B00319ECG0", "6305907110", "B00006ZXSL", "B00003CWQR", "B00005JM23", "B00003CXLD", "B000PHX5MS", "B0002DRDIW", "B00066FAZ8", "6305428425", "B00003CWN3", "B00005JKWM", "B003NHRIVQ", "B00081U7HC", "B00001PE4D", "B00DW5IL2E", "6305433917", "B00006HAWN", "B00866JL96", "B000053VB2", "B00005U8EL", "B000P0J0CY", "B00000I1KK", "B00004XPPD", "B000683VI4", "B002XUBDRY", "B005QX8UEE", "B00009AOBI", "B000021Y7E", "B002S8AGZG", "B00AEFYMGO", "0767821637", "B002CA68NO", "B000K2Q7CI", "B004SIP8LG", "B000065K5H", "B00005K3OS", "B002GIBVWA", "B00005LNGX", "B003Y5H574", "B001AK3S4O", "B00004RJ71", "B000S0SYIM", "B000H7JADY", "B0036TGSIK", "B004EPZ070", "B000BBOUUE", "B0000542C7", "B0000714BS", "B0045HCJGW", "B000XT1P52", "B001K98MG4", "B00164KYV4", "B002ZG989G", "B0000DIXDR", "6305433925", "B0034G4OZE", "B002NZK5V4", "B0000797IO", "B00AEBB9F0", "B002TZS5QU", "B00008K7AM", "B00132D7VS", "B000GB775E", "B00005N89M", "B001132GNY", "B00005JCCB", "B0010X5X4O", "B000ERVJHW", "B005LAIGSM", "B00005TNER", "B0007QJ210", "B004EPZ084", "B004499LX0", "B0029Z8K74", "B001B1UO6W", "B00AEBB9UU", "B009AJB0YM"], "bought_together": ["B00AMEZDJW", "B00447L4KA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00013RC2K", "B000087F7E", "B00005JKJS", "6305428425"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 16425}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.95, "brand": "Touchstone Video", "asin": "B00003CY5P", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y6266C4TL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Crazy/ Beautiful"}

{"description": "The second grab bag of 007 adventures features three Bonds in five films, including the legendary movie that started it all. In 1962 Sean Connery defined the cinematic James Bond as a tough, charming, and thoroughly professional cold war spy with a license to kill in the lean, hard-edgedDr. No. With Ursula Andress (as the original Bond girl Honey Ryder, who makes her entrance in a bikini), Bond battles a renegade supervillain with little more than his wits, his cunning, and his Walther PPK (this was before Q armed him with the coolest toys a superspy ever had). George Lazenby, a handsome Australian model with a self-effacing confidence, made his first and only appearance as James Bond in the underratedOn Her Majesty's Secret Service, a witty and action-packed adventure that makes 007 history when Bond marries the girl (the lovely and talented Diana Rigg, fresh from her duties as the butt-kicking spy on the TV seriesThe Avengers). Roger Moore brought a light tone and a suave assurance to the series as the third Bond, and the set features three of his seven appearances. InThe Man with the Golden Gun, he battles million-dollar assassin Christopher Lee, one of Bond's most magnetic adversaries.The Spy Who Loved Me, perhaps Moore's finest hour, is a return to the extravagant set pieces and cold war thrills of Connery's pictures and introduces Richard Kiel's steel-dentured Jaws to the series. Jaws returns as a comic figure inMoonraker, a misguided sci-fi entry that takes Bond to space for a physically impressive but dramatically lackluster adventure. More of a mixed bag than the initial seven-filmJames Bond Gift Set, this set is aimed at the Bond completist rather than the general fan. The DVD editions of the films each feature audio commentary by the director and key members of the crew, \"making of\" documentaries, and a host of stills, TV spots, and trailers.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000BYRO9", "B00006BH8G", "B001PPLIEG", "B00AQSN7HE", "B007REV4T8", "B00004WEJZ", "B00000K2SQ", "B00AZFECL8", "B001R10BN2", "B000RPCK1A", "B00000BLFI", "B000RPCK1K", "B000M53GNG", "B000NIBUR6", "B000M53GMW", "B000ICM5V2", "B00004RG62", "B00000BCPF", "B00005JL0I", "B001EDVNNU", "B000RPCK1U", "B000RPCK24", "B000M53GN6", "B000NIBURQ", "B000NDEXPM", "B000M53GM2", "B000M53GMC", "B000NDEXPC", "B000M53GLS", "B005PTYP70", "B000RPCK0Q", "B009RO9LKK", "B000NIBUS0", "B000ICM5VC", "B000NIBURG", "B001F12J0C", "B004BR7XLM", "B00G7QQ0RS", "B00DH34G9S", "B000EHSVS2", "1612185517", "B008YAPQX4", "B0087ZG7Q6", "B000QUU4LY", "B00AZMFJYA", "B002GSXKN8", "B001E75QH0", "B001HQZJMU", "B009PN18R2", "B008JFURII", "B007REV4YI", "B0011NVC98", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00008G8M4", "1618930311", "B008JFUOWM"], "bought_together": ["B0000BYRO9", "B00006BH8G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B006U1JD5G", "B007REV4T8", "B00006BH8G", "B008YAPQX4"]}, "price": 75.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 155749}, "asin": "B00004RG67", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JTH02YW9L._SX300_.jpg", "title": "The James Bond Collection, Volume 2"}

{"description": "Doris Wishman's film noir masterpiece? It's a stretch, but there's a certain grungy edge to the slapdash, shot-on-the-streets aesthetic ofBad Girls Go to Hell. This brilliant title belongs to the bizarre tale of a giddy young newlywed (Gigi Darlene) who changes her name and flees for New York after killing her building superintendent, a sleazy rapist with bad teeth. She seeks refuge with a sadistic drunk who lashes her with his belt, a predatory lesbian, and a pleasant landlady with a sex maniac husband. The feature was shot silent with sound dubbed in, and the odd, alienating quality actually makes her torrid ordeal more nightmarish, and it's got a doozy of an ending.Another Day, Another Man, the story of another newlywed who becomes a hooker to pay for her husband's sudden medical bills, is less lurid but has moments of sheer weirdness. Her pimp dreams of seducing twins and a fresh-faced farm girl into his fold (\"My day at the bus terminal had really paid off!\"), and the film climaxes with a strange, shocking ending. Known in the trade as \"roughies,\" these films lean to the violent side of Wishman but are more suggestive than literal (especially when she forgets to dub in the sound effects) and feature very little actual nudity. There is, however, plenty of lounging around in underwear and even some headstands. The prints are in nice condition and the DVD also features trailers, stills, and ad art for Doris Wishman films, and kitschy drive-in intermission shorts.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002IQB8U", "B000056NW6", "B0000YEDTA", "B00022PYRU", "B0000A0DX9", "B000KGGZW6", "B00008H2HK", "B000AYEI8Q", "B00004Y7GM", "B00HLTYRUM", "B000JJSKUY", "B00005NG04", "B00JDOQMH4", "B000MRA56A", "B0000YEDOK", "B000BZN1N2", "B0002NRRQ0", "B00005ALLZ", "B00029RSUO", "B00008RH0E", "B0000CG8H0", "B000V6LTCQ", "B000BZN1MI", "B00009Q4W2", "B00FB349R6", "B00016R10K", "B0002NRRT2", "B00005B6KQ", "B00022PYRK", "B00ESZZOLI", "B00A4KSJOA", "B000PC6YPS", "B000NO23TY", "B000FUF6YA", "B00005ABVI", "B00J2PQZEY", "B00GXG5668", "B0000687DF", "B00BRPCE9W", "B00006LPDO", "B00005M1ZX", "B00007ELDR", "B00006673Z", "B0000AKY4Z", "B000BZN1LY", "B0007R4T3A", "B000066740", "B000BC8T2S", "B00004Y7GK", "B000093NTB", "B000BZN1MS", "B000056NW7", "B00GXHO046", "B00B022GVS", "B00B94VJYW", "B0074B2N76", "B00006FMBN", "B00D9EJFV4", "B00005KH2P", "B000KGH034", "B0002EJ7JE", "B00125WAYQ", "B0001BKAFS", "B0041H3RO4", "B00BLQBQYQ", "B00029RSWC", "630587073X", "B0074B2N94", "B00BB0YYP0", "B00310PSUI", "B0053TWVWI", "B0000AKY51", "B000CCD256", "B00006IUIO", "B003VOVW4A", "B003ZW9ZRY", "B00004KDET", "6305944261", "B00005ALM0", "B00004Y7HK", "B0002V7SUW", "B000X9NOA6", "B00005B31H", "B0000C23H9", "B000AYEI6I", "B000HCPS8K", "6305944334", "B00068S3VY", "B000AYELMY", "B00004RE86", "B000A59Q7I", "B00008975J", "B00004W1A4", "B00008RH0U", "B000IOM1FK", "B000059H8L", "B00004Z4VJ"], "bought_together": ["B0002IQB8U", "B000056NW6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000056NW6", "B0000YEDTA", "B00022PYRU", "B00004Y7GM"]}, "price": 13.48, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 232327}, "asin": "B00004W190", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51q87HCnSFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bad Girls Go To Hell / Another Day Another Man"}

The subject of great controversy and scandal upon its initial release, THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI shocked 1948 audiences by presenting Hayworth with her flaming red hair cut short and dyed champagne blonde. Fifty years later, THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI is considered vintage Welles, his famous hall of mirrors climax hailed as one of the greatest scenes in cinematic history.", "related": {"bought_together": ["6305999872", "B00005JKGX"], "buy_after_viewing": ["6305999872", "B00004XPPK", "B0087ZG7OI", "B00005JKGX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 20855}, "categories": [["Movies & TV"]], "price": 15.94, "brand": "HAYWORTH,RITA", "asin": "B00004W229", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SZ2XP9A1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lady from Shanghai"}
{"description": "A promising comedy that goes awry all too early,But I'm a Cheerleaderconcerns a misunderstood high school kid (Natasha Lyonne) whose parents send her to a harsh, homosexual-rehabilitation camp despite a lack of evidence that she's gay. Ruled with an iron fist by a fascist counselor (Cathy Moriarty), the clinic only drives Lyonne's character toward an attraction to a rebellious tomboy (Clea DuVall), though screenwriter Brian Wayne Peterson and director Jamie Babbit are curiously intent on keeping the two apart and depriving the audience of other comic possibilities. Meanwhile, hoary clich&eacute;s abound: prancing boys, butch gays, lipstick lesbians. Despite a fine cast full of young talent, and cameo appearances by Julie Delpy and RuPaul Charles, this attempt to skewer a present-day trend in \"curing\" homosexuals of their sexual preferences is flattened by stereotypes and unimaginative thinking.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00002CGGH", "B0001HAGSI", "B000F7CEBG", "B00005QW5T", "B0009298MU", "B00004U104", "B00000I6D4", "B000J4QWIG", "B00023P4M4", "B00006RJ97", "B002SF9YTS", "B00003CYJ4", "B001AJIWQE", "B000AQOHN0", "B00827OWO8", "B008XAGN46", "B00GPPXNIK", "B00AFDN5Y0", "B000062Y1E", "B00011Y1QC", "B000A4T804", "B004BJMEO6", "B000SUKPL6", "B000OVLC0W", "B00004YKR3", "B00441GYVK", "B00003CWN3", "B004N21KIC", "B005Q4CLKW", "B00FKPJ3VM", "B00004STHG", "B000F3UA6Q", "B003YYVSEG", "B00DW5IKYS", "B00CLH0APA", "B0038M61IC", "B000GTJSO4", "0780628306", "B00441GYVA", "B00003CWQR", "B007PXYWBI", "B0002OXRSG", "B005OTQIK8", "B000067D0Y", "B005S9EIGU", "B004EI2NM2", "B0000714BP", "B00005ASPE", "B004AHAEV4", "B00JVLGL7U", "B001Y7CVXC", "B007OXB1H2", "B008XAT0VE", "B004SIP86Q", "B0009QTRVI", "B0002KPIQY", "B004AYMY92", "B000O76ZO4", "B00CBG9SQS", "0316009857", "B003M05KUA", "B00C1LIZEE", "B0085E44W8", "B00005J761", "B00009MEC4", "B004CWLRF4", "B00BDTSLEO", "B00005UJYC", "B0000560PU", "B00435KP44", "B003L20ICE", "B00125WAWI", "0374400113", "6305821216", "B0053TWVQ4", "B00005NRNS", "B005JZBPHS", "B00HW3EXCE", "B000BZISX0", "1575423634", "B000F3UA70", "B00005JKJS", "055327886X", "6305428425", "B007C95S9K", "B00H3RT7M0", "B0037QGS0A", "0792843983", "B000AM6OVW", "B000ETRCMQ", "B0002MPQRS", "B000FDEE86", "B00EMAGCHE", "0062020579", "B00ANGIC4W", "B00AG474YU", "B00005OLBC", "B00CMQIDKY", "0767837398", "B001EHDSPM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00GPPXNIK", "B000F7CEBG", "B00002CGGH", "B00827OWO8"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 189241}, "asin": "B00004X13Q", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DTW1ATQYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "But I'm A Cheerleader"}
{"description": "The Maltese FalconStill the tightest, sharpest, and most cynical of Hollywood's official deathless classics, bracingly tough even by post-Tarantino standards. Humphrey Bogart is Dashiell Hammett's definitive private eye, Sam Spade, struggling to keep his hard-boiled cool as the double-crosses pile up around his ankles. The plot, which dances all around the stolen Middle Eastern statuette of the title, is too baroque to try to follow, and it doesn't make a bit of difference. The dialogue, much of it lifted straight from Hammett, is delivered with whip-crack speed and sneering ferocity, as Bogie faces off against Peter Lorre and Sidney Greenstreet, fends off the duplicitous advances of Mary Astor, and roughs up a cringing \"gunsel\" played by Elisha Cook Jr. It's an action movie of sorts, at least by implication: the characters always seem keyed up, right on the verge of erupting into violence. This is a turning-point picture in several respects: John Huston (The African Queen) made his directorial debut here in 1941, and Bogart, who had mostly played bad guys, was a last-minute substitution for George Raft, who must have been kicking himself for years afterward. This is the role that made Bogart a star and established his trendsetting (and still influential) antihero persona.--David ChuteCasablancaA truly perfect movie,Casablanca(1942) still wows viewers today, and for good reason. Its unique story of a love triangle set against terribly high stakes in the war against a monster is sophisticated instead of outlandish, intriguing instead of garish. Humphrey Bogart plays the allegedly apolitical club owner in unoccupied French territory that is nevertheless crawling with Nazis; Ingrid Bergman is the lover who mysteriously deserted him in Paris; and Paul Heinreid is her heroic, slightly bewildered husband. Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, and Conrad Veidt are among what may be the best supporting cast in the history of Hollywood films. This is certainly among the most spirited and ennobling movies ever made.--Tom KeoghThe Big SleepHumphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall made screen history together more than once, but they were never more popular than in this 1946 adaptation of Raymond Chandler's novel, directed by Howard Hawks (To Have and Have Not). Bogart plays private eye Philip Marlowe, who is hired by a wealthy socialite (Bacall) to look into troubles stirred up by her wild, young sister (Martha Vickers). Legendarily complicated (so much so that even Chandler had trouble following the plot), the film is nonetheless hugely entertaining and atmospheric, an electrifying plunge into the exotica of detective fiction. William Faulkner wrote the screenplay.--Tom KeoghKey LargoJohn Huston directed this smart 1948 thriller about a gangster (Edward G. Robinson) who holds a number of people hostage in a hotel in the Florida Keys during a tropical storm. Humphrey Bogart is the returning war veteran who takes on the villains, and Lauren Bacall is on hand as one of the people on the wrong end of Robinson's gun. Somewhat similar in tone to Howard Hawks'sTo Have and Have Not(which also featured Bogart and Bacall), this moody movie captures a certain despair offset by the bond between individuals united by common purpose. Claire Trevor won an Academy Award for her part as Robinson's alcoholic girlfriend.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FFJYAW", "B0049985XW", "B00AEFXD1O", "078322592X", "B0087ZG7OI", "B00AEFYO5I", "B00AEBB89C", "B009T6CXG0", "B00005Q4D6", "B0047BXQZY", "B00AEFXNXW", "B00AEBBA0E", "B000G6BLWE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002VWNIAY", "B003ZEQMH8", "B000FFJYAW", "B003UGLCIK"]}, "price": 14.19, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 109271}, "asin": "B00004XMRW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518NNQHZA6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Humphrey Bogart Collection (The Big Sleep/The Maltese Falcon/Casablanca/Key Largo)"}
{"description": "Douglas Cheek's grotty urban horror fableC.H.U.D.deserves to be seen in its natural habitat--a Times Square grind-house theater--but horror enthusiasts will have to enjoy this widescreen version from the comforts of their own homes. John Heard stars as a former fashion photographer now pursuing a \"real\" career in photojournalism. While working on a piece about the homeless, he discovers that toxic waste, stashed in New York's sewer system, is turning tunnel squatters into the title acronym (Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dwellers). Teaming up with frazzled soup kitchen capo (and fellowHome Alonealumnus) Daniel Stern, Heard uncovers a government conspiracy behind the mutations; horror fans will know exactly how the government handles its uncovered wrongdoings. While Gary Sherman'sRaw Meat(1973) remains the final word in homeless horror films,C.H.U.D.has a threadbare charm, thanks to Cheek's poker-faced direction, the endearingly slap-dash effects (courtesy John Caglione Jr. and Ed French), and game performances by a surprisingly A-list cast, including appearances by John Goodman, Jay Thomas, Patricia Richardson, and Jon Polito.Anchor Bay's DVD is uncut and retains all of the cutting-room footage added by New World Pictures to beef up the butchered TV version; furthermore, it features a rollicking commentary by Cheek, Heard, Stern, cast mate Christopher Curry, and writer Shephard Abbott, which is worth the purchase price alone.

{"description": "Sidney Poitier is seldom praised as a pioneer of blaxploitation, but that's what he is inThey Call Me Mister Tibbs. This sequel's title is cribbed from its groundbreaking predecessor,In the Heat of the Night, but similarities end there, since this engaging murder mystery owes more to \"blaxpo\" and the urban police procedurals that dominated film and TV in the early 1970s. Poitier's got plenty of proto-funk charisma (and a Quincy Jones groove) as San Francisco detective Virgil Tibbs, dominating his Caucasian colleagues with quiet fortitude and sure-fire instincts. His latest case is rife with likely suspects, including a Bible-thumping reformer (Martin Landau) and a sleazy landlord (Anthony Zerbe). It's a routine plot by latter-day standards, but director Gordon Douglas enlivens it with solid character details: Poitier's scenes with his defiant young son (George Spell) are genuinely moving, and performances are uniformly superb.

{"description": "This thoroughly second-rate follow-up to the groundbreaking (and highly profitable) horror flickThe Blair Witch Project--produced byBlair Witchdirectors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez--plays with the notions of reality and fantasy that surrounded the hype of the original movie, and attempts to throw in some scares along the way. A year after the release of the original film, a group of five Blair Witch aficionados--four out-of-towners led by one seriously unhinged \"tour guide\"--venture into the woods outside Burkittsville, Maryland, on a tour of the sites made famous by missing documentarians Heather, Mike, and Josh. After a drunken night of camping out in hopes of communing with the spirit of the Blair Witch, the five wake up to find that their seemingly innocent sleep may have been disturbed somehow. But what exactly happened? If you're expecting suspense of the first degree and a horrifying payoff similar to the one that climaxed the first film, you'll be sorely disappointed. After retreating to an old, run-down broom factory (get it? Broom factory? Blair Witch? Oh well...), the five go over their videotapes of the night in question to get some answers, and basically wind up screaming at each other for the remainder of the film, and shedding some blood along the way. Documentary filmmaker Joe Berlinger (of the highly acclaimedParadise LostandBrother's Keeper) proves that he should definitely stick to nonfiction filmmaking, and the entire cast is grating and unpleasant, aside from a scene-stealing turn by Kim Director as a goth chick with attitude to burn and a no-nonsense approach to this Blair Witch stuff. Strictly for hard-coreBlair Witchfans only, and even then this sequel may prove to disappoint.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00001QGUM", "B00LLAV26O", "B00LMBUR6S", "B002AS45VK", "B00LBFFR2Y", "B0009X763M", "B003Y5H59M", "B00L6AW1K0", "B00AEFYYH6", "B00L9K2EGS", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B000I2J68M", "B00KTFJ5F2", "B00HRCATDW", "B003VE9WP6", "B000A6T1ZY", "B00L3OAS5Y", "B001NPD9LS", "B000099T3M", "B00IQHPS6A", "B001UGGVDI", "B00KUS5YGC", "B002LMSWN2", "B00AEFY31S", "B000MEYJHO", "B00IKM5LFY", "B0006SGYL0", "B00KTFJ50M", "B00006FDBT", "B003L20IEW", "B00006FI0R", "B000FS9FE4", "6305622760", "B000KJU1KK", "B0051GLDQS", "B0000CEB6Y", "B003VA3JUO", "B00HRCBGRA", "B0000AOX09", "B008874968", "B000BTIU4S", "B002VKE1K2", "B00AEFY37C", "B00L22H2IS", "B000BTJDGC", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00005N5RM", "B001B8XRT6", "B00004W4UD", "B002YI9304", "B009AMALGM", "B00GJ7CUFG", "B00AEFYV9W", "B004W48KHK", "B00GNAO70K", "B00000I1KK", "B00K2CHVSK", "B00J81S92S", "B0021L8UFI", "B001P3SA9Y", "B004P7CM9Q", "B00009MGEM", "B005CFBZQ6", "B0056P6SOG", "B00JF5GAIW", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00CERJI5U", "B003Q6D25K", "B00B96TGQS", "B000S0GYRU", "B00BM4Q4H6", "B00005LQ0Z", "B00005JOWW", "B009DA743Y", "B005B0QYMM", "B000A2X3U2", "B00003CWRF", "B000AM6OQ2", "B00AEFY2WI", "B0031U8OEK", "B001MVYUR0", "B000V4UFZK", "B0002C4JJ4", "B000GCFO0I", "B00HRUQ7WG", "B00IXD2MWK", "B0000VCZNE", "B009O07N9I", "B0002KQNL8", "B00AGKH4MG", "B001CT876C", "B001KKU9CI", "B00AEFY2LO", "B00I31COHA", "B000FSME9W", "B000WC3864", "B006P0FD4W", "B000A5045Q", "B008JFUNYG"], "bought_together": ["B00001QGUM", "B00AEFYYH6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00001QGUM", "B000FA57UI", "B00AEFYYH6", "B00BEIYMAG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 91036}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.99, "brand": "", "asin": "B000056T5E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51674ASQWCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Book of Shadows - Blair Witch 2 (DVD + CD)"}

{"description": "Director Hideaki Anno explores the pasts of his characters in these episodes, revealing the events that molded their personalities. In a flashback, Misato, who has just been promoted to major, recalls how her father rescued her from the destruction caused by the Second Impact. Her resentment of his single-minded devotion to his work at the expense of his family mirrors Shinji's troubled relationship with his father, Commander Ikari. Misato's experiences, which left her physically and psychologically scarred, caused her to dedicate her life to fighting the Angels. Shinji, the reluctant warrior, is dumbfounded when his aloof father praises his performance in battle but realizes he became an Eva pilot to hear those words. Ritsuko reveals her difficult relationship with her mother, who helped to create the powerful trio of computers known as the Magi. A colony of microscopic Angels invade the Magi, threatening NERV and Tokyo 3, but are defeated at the last possible moment. After two hard-hitting episodes, Anno changes pace in \"Seele.\" Commander Ikari recaps the Angel attacks and assures his superiors that everything is unfolding according to a plan revealed in the Dead Sea Scrolls--setting the stage for the next adventures.

{"description": "Lean, lanky Lee Horsley (TV'sMatt Houston) is hardly the iconic  image of a medieval warrior, but in this cheesyConan the Barbarianknockoff he makes his swaggering, mercenary Talon a genial smart aleck of a  barbarian hero. The plot is pure pulp clich&eacute;: evil Cromwell (Richard Lynch)  raises a demon to conquer a peaceful kingdom, kill the rulers, and imprison the  royal heirs, and the son of a murdered patriot returns to take his righteous vengeance  with a projectile-loaded, three-bladed sword. First-time director Albert Pyun apprenticed  under Akira Kurosawa and brings with him an eye for handsome images and a fluid sense  of action that helps overcome B-movie dialogue (\"Unlock this door, wench, and leave  that to us!\"), scenery-chewing performances, and bargain-basement budget. In one fight  sequence a guard punches a rock wall--and dents it! Kathleen Beller (the dark-eyed  beauty ofThe Betsy) is the rebel princess who enlists Talon to the cause,Route 66's charming wanderer George Maharis is a conniving traitor under an  unflattering mop of greasy hair, and Richard Moll dons a latex monster mask to play  the double-crossed demon. It's utterly silly and often awkward, but it does have  energy to spare. The sequel promised at the end of the film was never produced and  Pyun went on to direct some of the best straight-to-video action films of the 1990s,  includingNemesis.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001W72VPW", "B004ZKKKXI", "B00006G8H4", "B00AEFXT7W", "B000056WR3", "B00CQ8U6A8", "B0006J28MS", "B0062KMDPM", "B0002C9DJU", "B0001Z37HM", "B008D9NIK4", "B000068MAV", "B004VT9JLM", "B00HRUQB8Q", "B00004TJJV", "B00466X70Y", "630469654X", "B0000VD12I", "B00ESZZOCM", "B00GRZPRB4", "0783225741", "B002A00J0O", "B000Q66JXA", "B00K0MM4AM", "B00509KXYO", "B004ALIG0G", "B001AII4RM", "B00GV8AZRI", "B00CDV4RS0", "B00ISZNB6O", "B00AEFYEU8", "B00CPTUOAK", "B00JQHOKTA", "0792839706", "B006ZGROB6", "B007HMCQ6A", "B0001FGBWK", "B005HIBWBG", "B00I099JO6", "6305558167", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B00D97DMBU", "B0001NBMEE", "B00094ARU0", "0767810864", "B0030BOCL4", "B005IX3C5E", "B000A7Q1UQ", "B00CHMBQM0", "B00C7A8WZQ", "B00004WI53", "B0011E5M66", "B00049QJBG", "B000096I9X", "B00IIO9G28", "B004LV3VQE", "0792839684", "B003IMMEKG", "B0001I55U6", "B0002B15WY", "B00CPTUNZG", "B00441GYP6", "B00005JP4N", "B004EPYZT4", "B00ESZZOMM", "B001AR0D40", "B001JFZ118", "B003CS28UC", "B001AZKB8K", "B00GSMZ3I8", "B000Y5JFNE", "B0016LFG5G", "B003O7I6L6", "B001DJLD0S", "B00DOZNGTK", "B001ARDC16", "B000092Q5C", "B00DB97LRC", "B00ESZZOLI", "B003NOGNR4", "B00509KXVC", "B0009UVCQW", "B000FS9FE4", "B005K8RJME", "B00DOZNJWO", "B00GJNQ4M0", "B0033090D2", "0783225814", "B00DELKA66", "B00005UW7S", "155890848X", "B0053TWVA0", "0790742829", "B004VT9JMG", "B006WNMI0Y", "B00007JZUQ", "B00009PY4G", "B008ETVXQY", "B0088FS27C"], "bought_together": ["B001W72VPW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001W72VPW", "B004ZKKKXI", "B00AEFXT7W", "B0001Z37HM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 34596}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 99.98, "brand": "THE SWORD AND THE SORCERER", "asin": "B000059PP2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JW533FZKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Sword and the Sorcerer"}

{"description": "Not surprisingly, deleted scenes and outtakes are the hands-down  highlights ofGoldmember's abundant Infinifilm features. Mike Myers's  throwaway gags are funnier than Pauly Shore's entire career, revealing how a  relaxed set encourages a flood of inspired improvisation. The Infinifilm feature  is a handy, alternative method of seeing (and hearing) all of the bonus  materials in logical sequence, mostly comprising behind-the-scenes featurettes  devoted to costumes, special effects, all-star cameos, make-up, and various  \"social and historical\" aspects of the Austin Powers franchise. The Myers/Jay  Roach commentary track is worth a listening for Myers's casual jocularity (and  his decent willingness to give credit to others), but their Hollywood  compliments, while obviously sincere, eventually grow tiresome. More enjoyable  are the pop-up subtitles in the DVD's \"Fact Track\" feature, adding lighthearted  factoids to enhance an already very funny movie.

{"description": "Fill a bowl with alpine strawberries, break out the Ch&acirc;teau Lafite (1899, of course), and bask in this benchmark 1981 British miniseries based on Evelyn Waugh's classic novel. Adapted for the screen by John Mortimer (Rumpole of the Bailey), this impeccable, nearly 11-hour production mesmerized American viewers during the course of its PBS run in 1982. In his breakthrough role, Jeremy Irons stars as Charles Ryder, a disillusioned Army captain who is moved to reflect on his \"languid days\" in the \"enchanted castle\" that was Brideshead, home of the aristocratic Marchmain family, whose acquaintance Charles made in the company of an Oxford classmate, the charming wild child Sebastian. Anthony Andrews costars as the doomed Sebastian, whose beauty is \"arresting\" and \"whose eccentricities and behavior seemed to know no bounds.\" The \"entitled and enchanted\" Sebastian takes Charles under his wing (\"Charles, what a lot you have to learn\"), but vows early on that he is \"not going to let [Charles] get mixed up with [his] family.\" But mixed up Charles gets. He becomes a friend and confidante, not to mention a lover, to Sebastian's sister Julia (Diana Quick). Meanwhile, the self-destructive Sebastian's life spirals out of control.Brideshead Revisitedboasts a distinguished ensemble, including Laurence Olivier in his Emmy Award-winning role as the exiled Lord Marchmain, Claire Bloom as Lady Marchmain, and the magnificent John Gielgud as Charles's estranged father. Grand locations and a haunting musical score make this a memorable revisit of an irretrievable bygone era. For those who scheduled their weeks around the original Monday-night broadcasts or those visitingBridesheadfor the first time, this boxed set release will be, as Charles rhapsodizes at one point while strolling the castle grounds, \"very near to heaven.\"--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001AXL67W", "B006JY3OHW", "B004H0ZHD4", "B00DW5ILF6", "B005GRF2ZU", "B00007149J", "B0083HXKMC", "B008UQUS26", "B009L2EW5W", "0316216453", "B00065GX96", "B00F1BFRA6", "B000056KMW", "B000GYI3D6", "B00EF0NVGQ", "B0054DPLHK", "B0080QOL10", "B00BQXTDIU", "B004JMSIQS", "B0028AEO0M", "0316216445", "B00HUAH14Q", "B0013NAMLK", "B00003CXC9", "B003WEAVZK", "B005X5XIMO", "B00005JOA0", "B004499LWG", "B001B1Q2UO", "0060881305", "B00005V5NU", "B000FQIRXQ", "B004SI5VUO", "B002XTBECY", "B003YCI1UC", "B008KEQLW4", "B0001DCYUU", "B0009PVZIW", "B0007LFPJ8", "B0009PVZL4", "B000E0ODZE", "B007701RFS", "B00BGARGR8", "B000EDWLTQ", "B009Z59ZNE", "B00BOTCJXC", "0060881313", "B00FPPQYXM", "B0074FUSFG", "B001V7UXG2", "B001PU8N0I", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00HUAGZ34", "B003X2P9B2", "B00B62R9XM", "B0006Z2NAY", "B000784WNQ", "B00023BKO0", "B000M2E32M", "B004JMSIVI", "B004N66XYE", "B000A8AXXG", "B00ANGICCO", "B008PDAENC", "B003WEAW18", "B0007WRT4Q", "B00JLDTBCU", "B0002S648C", "B0009PVZM8", "B001P807RC", "B0012IV3Q4", "B008BF7TBY", "B00D3PYQT0", "B00JKEM36Q", "B000006UQ9", "B0038M2SAW", "B000I2J6WI", "B00D2UMHPG", "B00D2UMHIS", "B00005JKNF", "B004H0ZH20", "B00DUX28XQ", "B00EBBGKTE", "B00005R5GB", "B00003JRCQ", "B002TY78PU", "B0001WTUK8", "B009T6CXG0", "B00DQN6IOK", "B001B3LIPG", "B000S2B23E", "B005DJ7AYC", "B00E320W8Q", "B0011VJRVU", "B00A27O0N4", "B00HGE90Z4", "0316926051", "B000UJ48SQ", "B0099Y2MYK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005GRF2ZU", "0316216453", "B006JY3OHW", "B004H0ZHD4"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 213297}, "asin": "B00005JLG2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51T8PA0H0KL._SX300_.jpg", "title": "Brideshead Revisited"}
{"description": "Such a simple idea--yet so fiendishly complex in the execution.24, as surely everyone knows by now, is a thriller that takes places over 24 hours, midnight to midnight, in 24 one-hour episodes (well, 45-minute episodes if you subtract the commercials). Everything takes place in real time, which means no flashbacks, no flash-forwards, no handy time-dissolves. Every strand of the plot has to be dovetailed and interlocked so things happen just when they should, in the right amount of time. Not that easy.Creator Robert Cochran and his team of writers and directors have done an impressive job of putting the jigsaw together and keeping the tension ratcheted up high, as federal agent Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) runs around L.A. trying to stall an assassination attempt on an African American presidential candidate and rescue his wife and daughter from the clutches of the Balkan baddies. Twists, turns, revelations, and cliffhangers are tossed at us with satisfying regularity. It's not perfect: we get some hokey plot devices (instant amnesia, anybody?); the final twist makes no sense whatsoever; there are altogether too many huggy family moments; and as for Dennis Hopper's \"Serbian\" accent....Even so, this is undeniably mold-breaking TV. Sutherland, rescuing his career from the doldrums in one heroic leap, fully deserves his Golden Globe.

{"description": "Outstanding picture and sound plus tons of features makeCharlie's Angels: Full Throttlea fully loaded DVD.  Don't expect more T&A; in the unrated edition, however.  The only difference is glimpses of more intense violence in a few of the fight scenes.  For example, in the theatrical version you'll see an angel flying through the air, but in the unrated version you'll then see her lying expressionless on the ground.  Also, blood flies out of Drew Barrymore's mouth in one scene.  On his commentary track, director McG discusses inside jokes, visual effects, and shots that didn't quite work for him.  Like a TV sportscaster, he uses a telestrator, but only to occasionally circle items of interest or draw arrows.  There's also an amusing commentary track by the three writers, who chuckle over inside jokes and discuss how the film was changed from the original script.  They preface their comments with: \"I guess they asked us to do this just to prove that writers worked on this movie.\"  \"Who are we kidding?  Who's listening to this right now?\"If you want still more info, there's a trivia track with pop-up factoids with occasional links to more featurettes, a jukebox that offers clips of 11 songs and explanations of why they were picked, a cameo-graphy that offers clips of 13 personalities and why we should know them, and eight 4- to 18-minute featurettes exploring such topics as stunts, vehicles, costumes, and the Pussycat Dolls dance troupe.  And in the next evolution of product placement, the DVD-ROM \"Shop the Scene\" feature allows you to search for a character's outfit or gadget then buy it online.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002A5EBMQ", "B00164EAGY", "B00003CXZ1", "B00AEFYGBA", "B000069HYG", "B0000SX9N2", "B00005JL8Z", "B00004ZDO9", "B008H6GHII", "B000UDGOC0", "B007AFC0RY", "B0006L0LOS", "B000085EFK", "B0007P0Y7C", "B00003CXMP", "B00024JC4E", "B00016MSV2", "B0007PLLBU", "B001C5LLQ4", "B00005MEVO", "B000BKJ758", "B000MX7V70", "B000035Z3G", "B002GHHHL0", "B000LC3ICE", "B000FDFSH2", "B0006GANPA", "B000Y11BC6", "B000AP04FG", "B00026ZG10", "B0041KKYGU", "B00005JMUA", "0767819640", "B0018PH3KQ", "B00008G7UI", "B00BLN4V0A", "B002GOAH1A", "B00006HAWN", "B0001BS3IE", "B0009RCPUW", "B002ZG984Q", "B001EDVNNU", "B000VI70QS", "B004LWZW2O", "B000A343RI", "B0006FO8E8", "B000EGDB10", "B000RW3VCU", "B00005JN4H", "B00BTYMPUY", "B00005J761", "B000CEXGAU", "B005TK0MFE", "B0041ONFOE", "B000VG66XS", "B00ID8H98C", "B00007AJF5", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B0009W5JR8", "B008JFURII", "B00001PE4D", "B000M7FOO8", "B004P7CN7W", "B0000DZ6N3", "B00005JM5B", "B00007GZRP", "B000ARXF96", "B0018CNNV2", "B000CCW2P2", "B0009KA2OA", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B00006G8JD", "B0008FXT1Y", "B0000524E5", "B002GSXKOW", "B00005JM55", "B003Q6D2B4", "B005CFBYW6", "B00008WJD6", "B000ENC5YW", "B003FCKI3O", "B005Z9MFRC", "B00004STVN", "B00005JG6N", "B00E1HIXEI", "B0007OCG56", "B00005JMEW", "B000BTIU4S", "B00008WJEZ", "B000NIBURQ", "B000EQ5V8G", "B0001Z37HM", "B003PIUINS", "B00005JMW7", "B00196UTEG", "B000A2IPQY", "B004SIP6VI", "B00005JLZW", "B00005JNTU", "B00AEFXCLU"], "bought_together": ["B002A5EBMQ", "B00AEFYGBA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002A5EBMQ", "B0000CABE5", "B000069HYG", "B008JFUUIA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 26650}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.9, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00005JLYW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51L5TYVcBmL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle (Unrated Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "There's only one deleted scene in this two-disc DVD set, but it's a doozy. The \"Sgt. Candy Scene\" is a must-see and, unfortunately, the best thing on the second disc. The rushed HBO documentary shows us far more flash than substance. Better is the Visual Effects Lab that goes more in-depth with four sequences, although you need to wade through a hokey interface for each segment. Making your \"own\" effects isn't that much fun; you can only choose a few effects that change in two scenes. Anyone looking to get the complicated backstory of the trilogy figured out should dig into the \"Sky Net Database\" and an intricate timeline. The two commentary tracks are worth a listen, with director Jonathan Mostow's solo track the better one. The director goes into great detail on how the little things (from lighting street scenes to tricks for destroying buildings) count.  The second track is pieced together from the actors recorded separately. Mostow appears with actress Claire Danes (doing her first commentary track) and their chemistry is enjoyable after a slow start. The other actors have less interesting things to say, including Schwarzenegger who is constantly--yet enthusiastically--selling the film.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5", "B001FB55HQ", "B00005JA8B", "B00070FX5U", "B00007AJG4", "B002ZG98LO", "B000T9OP7G", "B002GHHHME", "B00005JKIP", "B002QFYJFY", "B0002J58HO", "B0000AXE8I", "B001AQO43M", "B00AKGG828", "B00026ZG10", "B0001BKAEY", "B00IZZDWKM", "B001451HXO", "B0000VCZK2", "B000056PMU", "B000BPL2FQ", "B000RW3VCK", "B0004Z33F0", "B000U1ZV8K", "B0045HCJGC", "B0004Z33EQ", "B00005JNTU", "B000HRMAPE", "B00008G8M4", "B000RRS7RE", "B00005JKYX", "B0000VD12I", "B000FC2FQA", "B00000ILDG", "B00000G3PA", "B00005JMZK", "B000MGBSE4", "B0087ZG7J8", "B0004Z33EG", "B000P0J0AQ", "B00005JMEW", "B0087ZG7NO", "B00003CXTA", "B0002CHK1S", "B000RJO56E", "B00177YA1K", "B00004STDN", "B005COLETU", "B001AK3S4Y", "B000VNMMR0", "B0000959N0", "B00005JMUA", "1558908846", "6305767866", "B001RIY4WE", "B0049IHX2C", "B000VI70QS", "B000EGDB10", "B002GSXKN8", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B0045HCJ9O", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00005JNJV", "B001451HX4", "B00I9TDMRM", "B0006GANOQ", "B00003CXSP", "6305428115", "B00016MSV2", "B00005JOC9", "B000TJBN80", "B009MO57H6", "B000O77SQS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B001OST0M6", "B005LAIHXQ", "B0002J4X1Q", "B0002V7OI8", "B0015XHP2C", "6304806434", "B000QXDED6", "B00005JL3K", "B008JFUPFI", "B003PIUINS", "0783225946", "0792839056", "B00005N7Z1", "B0006GAO6I", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00005JL78", "B001HN697M", "B00IJS2OXG", "B002NXSRVG", "B00008G8M5", "B00005JN0T", "B003XURDAY", "B000O77SRM", "B006VRRGNK", "B00F4FFO8E"], "bought_together": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5", "B001FB55HQ", "B002JT6AO0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 115564}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.47, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JM0B", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5143TFPX8SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "In terms of alluring female nudity,Swimming Poolshows a lot, but it's what remains concealed that gives this erotic thriller a potent, voyeuristic charge. With his Hitchcockian handling of secrets and lies, prolific French director Fran&#xE7;ois Ozon reunites with hisUnder the Sandstar, Charlotte Rampling, to tell a seductive tale of murder and complicity, beginning when British mystery novelist Sarah Morton (Rampling) seeks peace and relaxation at her publisher's French villa, only to find his brash, sexually liberated daughter Julie (Ludivine Sagnier) arriving shortly thereafter to disrupt her solitary reverie. What begins as mutual annoyance turns into something more sinister and duplicitous, alternating between Julie's predatory sex with men and Sarah's observant, perhaps jealous fascination. These two women, generations apart, share in Ozon's delicate dance of trust, curiosity, and gradual understanding, until a twist ending that forces you to reevaluate everything you've seen. Only then will the mysteries ofSwimming Poolbe fully and tantalizingly revealed. (Note: The unrated version contains full-frontal nudity that's been edited from the rated version.

{"description": "Like a good dream, Sofia Coppola'sLost in Translationenvelops you with an aura of fantastic light, moody sound, head-turning love, and a feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, even though you've probably never been to this neon-fused version of Tokyo. Certainly Bob Harris has not. The 50-ish actor has signed on for big money shooting whiskey ads instead of doing something good for his career or his long-distance family. Jetlagged, helplessly lost with his Japanese-speaking director, and out of sync with the metropolis, Harris (Bill Murray, never better) befriends the married but lovelorn 25-year-old Charlotte (played with heaps of poise by 18-year-old Scarlett Johansson). Even before her photographer husband all but abandons her, she is adrift like Harris but in a total entrapment of youth. How Charlotte and Bill discover they are soul mates will be cherished for years to come. Written and directed by Coppola (The Virgin Suicides), the film is far more atmospheric than plot-driven: we whiz through Tokyo parties, karaoke bars, and odd nightlife, always ending up in the impossibly posh hotel where the two are staying. The wisps of bittersweet loneliness of Bill and Charlotte are handled smartly and romantically, but unlike modern studio films, this isn't a May-November fling film. Surely and steadily, the film ends on a much-talked-about grace note, which may burn some, yet awards film lovers who \"always had Paris\" with another cinematic destination of the heart.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305428239", "B0007UC8Y4", "B000BX8R10", "B00005JMJG", "B0000640VJ", "B0010X8NF0", "B003UESJLU", "B007L6VR12", "0767821408", "B00007AJF8", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00DW5IKYS", "B001QOGYBI", "B000M06KJ8", "B00005JLRE", "B00000G02H", "B0006TPE4C", "B0007TKOAA", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00DYVUBYM", "B00H9HZITU", "B000Z8GZYW", "B004SEUIXS", "B00AEFXN9G", "B003CRM6PA", "B00008RH3J", "B000EQHXNW", "B0001I1K32", "B0008JIJ2O", "B001DJ7PR8", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0009PVZD2", "B000CS464G", "B00337KM2S", "B003102JDM", "0790734796", "B001P3SA8K", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B0000WN0SC", "B00003CWTI", "B00003CXZ4", "B00008975Z", "B0057ZAA6W", "B000IU37SO", "B00004RJ73", "B00AEFXGIY", "B007P9HW3M", "B005MYEQ4U", "B000K7VHQE", "B00005JNC2", "B00079Z9VO", "B000063JDE", "B0001US61O", "B0000WN15O", "B00G7QPXUI", "B0041KKYEM", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00006LPGP", "B0006H32EI", "B00005JKJA", "B00AEFYCL4", "B000KX0IOK", "B002T9H2LA", "B001TOD92C", "B004XVMCKS", "B00AEBB9CS", "B008220DGE", "0767802519", "B000069HYF", "B007D5E7C2", "B000M7XRAG", "B004U7MR14", "B003O7I6SE", "B000A7DVR2", "B005LAIIJY", "B00A81MV3U", "B000055Y0X", "B00005V9HH", "B000E33VWW", "0783225903", "B00AEFXE9U", "B000N6TX1I", "B00CIOD6HK", "B0021L8UOY", "B004SIP95G", "B000PAAJZ6", "B002ZG980U", "B007UW9WOQ", "B00GKOJ98E", "B0014D5RBE", "B00011CZRE", "B001HN699A", "B000M4RG7E", "B003ELKNH2", "0767802535", "B00121QGPY", "B004FQX5B6", "6305609764", "B0009A40ES"], "bought_together": ["B0007UC8Y4", "6305428239"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00JAQJMJ0", "B007L6VR12", "B001QOGYBI", "B0010X8NF0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2901}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.77, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JMJ4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518vLN4%2B7KL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lost in Translation"}

{"description": "A ratings hit for eight seasons on CBS, the action-mystery seriesMagnum, P.I.makes its DVD boxed set debut in an impressive five-disc package that offers not only the entire first season, but some rarely seen episodes. Positioned in the oldHawaii Five-Otime slot (Thursdays at 9) in December of 1980,Magnumquickly became a hit, thanks to the combination of smart and witty scripting, gorgeous locations, and the considerable charm of lead Tom Selleck as former Naval Intelligence officer Thomas Magnum, who gives up his position to become a private investigator on Oahu with the help of fellow Vietnam vets T.C. (Roger E. Mosley) and Rick (Larry Manetti). Magnum also provided security for the lavish estate of wealthy (and never-seen) mystery writer Robin Masters, which gave him access to the author's expensive vehicles (including a prized Ferrari), much to the disapproval of Masters's manservant Higgins (Jonathan Hillerman).A rare series that skillfully blended action, humor, drama, and suspense,Magnum, P.I.'s first season gets the boxed set treatment its fans have been hoping for, with all 18 first-season episodes (including the two-part pilot, \"Don't Eat the Snow in Hawaii\") included on four discs. The fifth disc contains four rarely shown bonus episodes, including season 3's \"Ki'ls Don't Lie,\" which featured a crossover plot withSimon and Simon, as well as its conclusion (\"Emeralds Are Not a Girl's Best Friend\"), which kicked offS&S;'s second season; the latter episode has never been aired as part ofMagnum's syndicated package, which is another reason for fans to pick up and enjoy this long-awaited set.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007LXP86", "B000BUE5DC", "B000E5KQMI", "B000HXDWG4", "B000M9BPGC", "B00113ALL8", "B000BGR1B4", "B000TZX5XK", "B000GW8UAE", "B000LE16VC", "B000BF0C8E", "B000LXGXY8", "B001JTRKHW", "B00005JLEY", "B000N2HD6O", "B00005JO3P", "B002WQ79A4", "B000BKVKSA", "B000PGTPC8", "B00FWMVVJ0", "B000ASDFIG", "B001DHXT7U", "B0024FAD7Y", "B000XJD3K2", "B004UV3KSE", "B001JFKWE4", "B000HWZ4HU", "B00E8AVN9A", "B00005JN8S", "B000BUE5D2", "B000WQWPSM", "B000MLWQ6I", "B000OVLMKC", "B007AAF3FK", "B0030Y12AK", "B0007LXP7W", "B001S86IYK", "B00008NV4G", "B0009FU0ZQ", "B001675ZJM", "B000GRU09I", "B0014FAIXE", "B00H4ZEJAG", "B005LFQRTC", "B00HZMZ286", "B00KTZALDC", "B0007CNY4K", "B0002NY81C", "B00DYQ1G78", "B001J0FVYK", "B000O77SNG", "B0007Y08SS", "B003BGZ60Y", "B0006IUDXA", "B000MLWQ6S", "B004MLEYV4", "B0009UC80G", "B00BUWD7NE", "B00009VRF0", "B00H4ZEJCO", "B00116GEK2", "B0002COTDA", "B00HUPC5QU", "B002XKKX8E", "B001E6HUXO", "B000TXPXCS", "B00HV0TJM2", "B001DMVZJ4", "B0009NZ36O", "B003XMKU3Y", "B001B187NO", "B0012EM5EW", "B000YKYT1M", "B000NJISJ8", "B00005JOJP", "B003ES5JJ2", "B000E5KQM8", "B002ZTLVXY", "B008H6GHII", "B002LFQIL2", "B000BOH8YG", "B0006N2EZK", "B000GNOSHW", "B0025X4PAQ", "B003R4ZMNQ", "B000E5KQLY", "B000B8IA3U", "B000F9T70K", "B000K7UBXE", "B00008972G", "B004DCM5RC", "B00005JM3A", "B003W5C0TY", "B005TFVM0I", "B00471JT0K", "B0028S110K", "B00008EY6N", "B0030VANJO", "B00H4ZEJ6K", "B000Q6GUSE"], "bought_together": ["B0007LXP86", "B000BUE5DC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DYQ1G78", "B000BF0C8E", "B000E5KQMI", "B000BGR1B4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14692}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.46, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

On the surface, there's nothing out of the ordinary here with the exception of a few minutes of rehearsal footage, but everything is just so darn interesting to watch. Mann and his stars dish about the making of the film, including the creation of Cruise's assassin. The nighttime shooting (shot digitally and transferred sublimely) is examined along with a single deleted scene (with a clear explanation on why it was cut). Think the climatic finale aboard a train was shot on a subway for convenience? No, Mann just wanted to control the backgrounds!

Jenkins and composer BT discuss the score in the other featurette, including how \"the score was conceived from the ground up in 5.1\" (the DVD's sound is all-enveloping) as well as the use of the hurdy-gurdy and the contribution of Journey's Steve Perry (even this featurette is in DTS).

{"description": "Based on the perennial nonfiction bestseller by H.G. Bissinger,Friday Night Lightslooks at high school football in the harsh light of reality, finding heart and hardness while stirring our emotions. Actor-director Peter Berg (Very Bad Things, The Rundown) is Bissinger's cousin; he knows the material well, and understands how an obsession with winning turns high school kids into somber, over-pressured gladiators--expendable soldiers in a community war against shame and obscurity. The fact-based story focuses on the 1988 football season of Odessa-Permian high school in West Texas, and as a fast-paced sports movie, Berg delivers the goods with a rousing, frenetically styled crowd-pleaser. But there's darkness in this tale of weary underdogs, including an abusive father (well-played by country music star Tim McGraw), threatening townsfolk, an injured star running back (Derek Luke), a tormented quarterback (Lucas Black), and the melancholy coach (Billy Bob Thornton) who takes his team to the finals. Berg's film could use less flashy cutting and more drama to support its gridiron intensity, butFriday Night Lightsoffers a refreshing alternative to the conventional sports movie, and makes a perfect triple-feature with the equally exciting documentariesGo Tigers!andThe Last Game.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JPBO", "B00AEBB9UU", "B000056VP4", "B005CA4SOM", "B002NZK5QO", "B000J3OTT6", "B000EXZFCQ", "B00004W221", "6305428492", "B000KHYN9C", "0306809907", "B00AEFXOKO", "B002VECM6S", "B0001US66Y", "B001LGXIA6", "B00E1HIXFW", "B0032UYFAQ", "B004BFTFBU", "B003L77GCE", "0792843592", "B001RXDM2C", "B00B83N2NU", "B0014DO5XU", "B000RF1QE2", "B002O3Z4XY", "B000068NNU", "B00AEFYJI0", "B009YQJ2Q4", "B000A0GP0Y", "B000649YAM", "B00008EY60", "B000MNOX94", "1935618563", "B000FVR1T2", "B000GAKDAG", "B00AEFXJY0", "B009NNM9OA", "B001FB55NK", "B000ARTN3I", "630529142X", "B00002SSKG", "B00AEBB9AA", "630514415X", "0201196778", "B0060ZJ7BC", "B00553K9IA", "B00000G3PA", "B00004Z4WR", "6305313687", "B003UESJHO", "B00AEFYKWU", "0800141741", "B00028HBES", "B0002S94CK", "B0000AC8LH", "B00004RE45", "B000TZJBPQ", "B00009OWJV", "B000274T94", "B00005JLRZ", "B001G5T6GW", "B00AEBBA36", "B00004Y2R1", "B000035Z59", "B0068FZ0GK", "B000Y7WGOW", "B004KPLVX6", "B004GJYROG", "B00004TJQJ", "B003UESJ9M", "B000M4RG42", "B00AEBB86A", "B005OZVXCU", "B006X08ET0", "B00005JM10", "B00005JLG1", "B002GIBVVQ", "B00003CXTG", "B002ZG99N6", "B001FB55L2", "B00AEBBA2M", "0800177258", "B00003CXNY", "6304765258", "B000VG66XS", "B002YMWQ2M", "B000WZEZGI", "B0002J4YVK", "B0007LLPXI", "B004GJYRF0", "B000F4RH84", "B000F6ZIIS", "B000068QPY", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B002T4GWWA", "B0034G4P94", "B000NO39FG", "B000ADWDE8", "B00003GPFT", "B0000633U2"], "bought_together": ["B000056VP4", "B00005JPBO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004GXKBF6", "0306809907", "B000056VP4", "B005CA4SOM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7523}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.89, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JNEW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X7RX6KY3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Friday Night Lights (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "There's a pretty good gimmick with these DVD extras aimed squarely at the pre-teen/early teen audience that ate up this film. Each of the extras (a standard making-of featurette, an alternate ending, and an interesting deleted scene) is followed by a clue afterwards. Decipher the clues and unlock the next set of extras: a nice bit on real treasure hunters, an awful piece on the Knights Templar, and one gem for kids: \"Riley Poole's Decode this!\" Actor Justin Bartha reprises his role (Nic Cage's techno-sidekick) and lectures a bit on the cooler side of language history and code-breaking with a few simple interactive games. If you get through it all, you unlock a hidden feature, a trivia track. Thankfully, those who do not want to go on the treasure hunt can access these features by reading the printed insert.

{"description": "Relying on the tried-but-true odd-couple set up,Perfect Strangersfocuses on the comical lives of Larry Appleton (Mark Linn-Baker) and Balki Bartokomous (Bronson Pinchot). Larry is an uptight American who has moved away from his family's Wisconsin home for his own apartment in Chicago. His life is changed forever when his childlike cousin Balki--a sheepherder from the fictional island of Mypos--shows up on his doorstep with the goal of becoming a U.S. citizen. A hit sitcom for ABC that ran from 1986 to 1993,Perfect Strangersoffers some heartwarming storylines, a few laughs, and some genuine chemistry between the two leads. The first few years of the comedy are among the show's best, as Larry and Balki get accustomed to each other's ways. Linn-Baker plays the straight man who sets Pinchot up to deliver the best lines. While Pinchot definitely has the showier \"fish out of water\" part--and \"Don't be ridiculous!\" tag line that became a catchphrase for a year or two--Linn-Baker creates the more relatable character. He's working in a small shop, but his dream is to become a photojournalist. The show actually does a nice job of making sure Larry never loses sight of his goals, even as Balki is dragging him from one adventure to another. The four-disc DVD set includes all six episodes from the first mini season, as well as 22 episodes from the show's second full season. Other than a \"Dance of Joy\" extra--which includes a montage of dance clips from the first two seasons--there are no special featurettes. Fans of high definition may be disappointed by the video transfer, which clearly dates the series. At its worst,Perfect Strangersis an outdated show that isn't as funny as it thinks it is. But at its best, it projects giddy innocence and is easy viewing. Flash-forward to 2005 when Pinchot is throwing himself at Janice Dickinson on the reality seriesThe Surreal Life: Nowthat'snot easy to watch.--Jae-Ha Kim", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001NPK5BU", "B000R7I3YG", "B000EU1QC2", "B001GP5TMW", "B001LRL4WY", "B000VWQU88", "B000CELOVI", "B00465I1D8", "B000OVLBH6", "B000EQ45BU", "B00005JO2V", "B000CELOW2", "B000C6NPHC", "B004GJYR82", "B002ACKBTG", "B0001Z3I1C", "B00005JOQZ", "B005XLFB32", "B00CVB6XDO", "B008VIMLRI", "B000HIVIOC", "B001P9N9B2", "B0002JZT5U", "B0000DFZ5O", "B0002I837M", "B009X919YU", "B007JNZYPM", "B00008EYBH", "B0089BSLKS", "B000QUEQ5O", "B007RMQ4HW", "B00I099K4U", "1603994173", "B000EGDAO8", "B000291Q3O", "B0002DB5N6", "B00GOC75YW", "B0007WQHFS", "B0001O3YHQ", "B0006N2EZK", "B001D2WUDE", "B000ORDM7C", "B00I2YXN5A", "B00GOC74QG", "B000NJMJHA", "B000CCBCCQ", "B00BM2JVAA", "B004DOTKCS", "1603993428", "B000M343B2", "B000FA57U8", "B0007WFXL2", "B004NJC0IO", "B00BWQU0RY", "B00151QYT4", "B003BGZ61S", "B0028SVY3Y", "B000MGBLFK", "B000B8IA3U", "B00480OCXO", "B00020X83Y", "B000DZ95IU", "B003XL6EI0", "B000H1RFXM", "B009TTGLJ2", "B00GLT2SOA", "B003XL6EHQ", "B000RGULLA", "B001993YB8", "B0002Y4T7O", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B000F7CMPE", "B000Q6GUJS", "B004ZJ9W2Y", "B007RMQ56M", "B00961EO24", "B000FTC1GW", "B000UX6TL6", "B00I458456", "B00005JLIB", "B0012EM5E2", "B001TKJDNA", "B000EWBKP8", "B008L0YMWS", "B00GSEGOYI", "B0006N2EZA", "B001992NXI", "B00JAD6BYW", "B00HZMZ286", "B000M343AS", "B000FJAAHY", "B00KS9V6EC", "B000MXPE6U", "B000FGFBR6", "B0025KVNOU", "B00EC9UI0C", "B000EYK4H6", "B000QFCDAO", "B000AJJNIQ", "B000YKYT1M"], "bought_together": ["B000R7I3YG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JO2V", "B000R7I3YG", "B001GP5TMW", "B0000DFZ5O"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22707}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 10.59, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JNIS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51332lsy0rL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Perfect Strangers: The Complete First and Second Seasons"}
{"description": "Movies don't come any bigger than Peter Jackson'sKing Kong, a three-hour remake of the 1933 classic that marries breathtaking visual prowess with a surprising emotional depth. Expanding on the original story of the blonde beauty and the beast who falls for her, Jackson creates a movie spectacle that matches hisLord of the Ringsfilms and even at times evokes their fantasy world while celebrating the glory of '30s Hollywood. Naomi Watts stars as Ann Darrow, a vaudeville actress down on her luck in Depression-era New York until manic filmmaker Carl Denham (a game but miscast Jack Black) entices her with a lead role. Dazzled by the genius of screenwriter Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody), Ann boards the tramp steamer S.S.Venture, which she--and most of the wary crew--believes is headed for Singapore. Denham, however, is in search of the mythic Skull Island, hoping to capture its wonders on film and make a fortune. What he didn't count on were some scary natives who find that the comely Darrow looks like prime sacrifice material for a mysterious giant creature....There's no point in rehashing the entire plot, as every movie aficionado is more than familiar with the trajectory ofKing Kong; the challenge facing Jackson, his screenwriters, and the phenomenal visual-effects team was to breathe new life into an old, familiar story. To that degree, they achieve what could be best called a qualified success. Though they've assembled a crackerjack supporting cast, including Thomas Kretschmann as theVenture's hard-bitten captain and young Jamie Bell as a plucky crewman, the first third of the movie is rather labored, with too much minute detail given over to sumptuous re-creations of '30s New York and the unexciting initial leg of theVenture's sea voyage. However, once the film finds its way to Skull Island (which bears more than a passing resemblance toLOTR's Mordor),Kongturns into a dazzling movie triumph, by turns terrifying and awe-inspiring. The choreography and execution of the action set pieces--including one involving Kong and a trio of Tyrannosaurus Rexes, as well as another that could be charitably described as a bug-phobic's nightmare--is nothing short of landmark filmmaking, and a certain Mr. Spielberg should watch his back, asKongtrumps most anything that has come before it.Despite the visual challenges ofKing Kong, the movie's most difficult hurdle is the budding romance between Ann and her simian soulmate. Happily, this is where Jackson unqualifiedly triumphs, as this unorthodox love story is tenderly and humorously drawn, by turns sympathetic and wondrous. Watts, whose accessibility balances out her almost otherworldly loveliness, works wonders with mere glances, and Andy Serkis, who digitally embodies Kong here much as he did Gollum in theLOTRfilms, breathes vibrant life into the giant star of the film without ever overplaying any emotions. The final, tragic act of the film, set mostly atop the Empire State Building, is whereKongearns its place in movie history as a work that celebrates both the technical and emotional heights that film can reach.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"bought_together": ["B000EHQTZO", "B00AEFYEU8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EHQTZO", "B00AEFYEU8", "B0087ZG7HK", "0767817478"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 32487}, "categories": [["Movies & TV"]], "price": 8.94, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JO20", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513Y54TGdwL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "King Kong (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Critics and controversy aside,The Da Vinci Codeis a verifiable blockbuster. Combine the film's huge worldwide box-office take with over 100 million copies of Dan Brown's book sold, andThe Da Vinci Codehas clearly made the leap from pop-culture hit to a certifiable franchise. The leap for any story making the move from book to big screen, however, is always more perilous. In the case ofThe Da Vinci Code, the plot is concocted of such a preposterous formula of elements that you wouldn&#x92;t envy screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, the man tasked with making this story filmable. The script followsDan Brown&#x92;s bookas closely as possible while incorporating a few needed changes, including a better ending. And if you&#x92;re like most of the world, by now you&#x92;ve read the book and know how it goes: while lecturing in Paris, noted Harvard Professor of Symbology Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is summoned to the Louvre by French police to help decipher a bizarre series of clues left at the scene of the murder of the chief curator. Enter Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), gifted cryptologist. Neveu and Langdon team up to solve the mystery, and from there the story is propelled across Europe, ballooning into a modern-day mini-quest for the Holy Grail, where secret societies are discovered, codes are broken, and murderous albino monks are thwarted&#x85; oh, and alternative theories about the life of Christ and the beginnings of Christianity are presented too, of course. It&#x92;s not the typical formula for a stock Hollywood thriller. In fact, taken solely as a mystery, the movie almost works--despite some gaping holes--mostly just because it keeps moving. Brown&#x92;s greatest trick was  to have the entire story take place in one day, so the action is forced to keep moving, despite some necessary pauses for exposition. As a screen couple, Hanks and Tautou are just fine together but not exactly memorable; meanwhile Sir Ian McKellen&#x92;s scenery-chewing as pivotal character Sir Leigh Teabing is just what the film needed to keep it from taking itself too seriously. The whole thing is like a good roller-coaster ride: try not to think too much about it--just sit back and enjoy the trip.--Daniel VanciniVisit The Da Vinci Code StoreOn The DVDThe DVD extras on a film as popular asThe Da Vinci Codeshould be plentiful, and this version doesn&#x92;t skimp. With over 90 minutes of special features, including ten behind-the-scenes featurettes, there&#x92;s a lot here to explore beyond the film itself. The question is, is there anything new here that we haven&#x92;t heard before, in all the hype, pseudo-documentaries, and controversy surrounding the movie, to make it worthwhile?  For most viewers, the answer will be \"yes.\" Essentially, if you like the movie, if you enjoyed the book, you will get a lot out of them.Just as the movie is intended to make the book come to life, the DVD extras should make the film come to life by pointing the audience into the world of the filmmakers, connecting the dots between print and film, and for the most part they do just that. The extras here range from the typical look behind-the-scenes to more in-depth features on the supporting characters, the locations, and theMona Lisaherself.  \"First Day on the Set with Ron Howard\" features the director gushing about the opportunity to film in the Louvre and work with Tom Hanks again (the two worked together before onSplashandApollo 13). It&#x92;s a short piece that doesn&#x92;t reveal much beyond making an attempt to share Howard&#x92;s excitement (with the \"Gee, I really loved working with him/her on this project\" that you hear in every such featurette), but viewers might enjoy seeing how the stage was set up in the famous museum, down to the spike tape on the floor showing actors where to hit their marks.The Filmmaking Experience, Parts 1 and 2further explores the creative and technical aspects of the filmmaking process.A Conversation with Dan Brownstarts out feeling like a puff-piece (the man who wrote this book got started at age 5 with a story calledThe Giraffe, The Pig, and the Pants on Fire. \"It was a thriller,\" he says.) and unfortunately it doesn&#x92;t go very deep into much of anything of interest. But on the other hand, this isn&#x92;t60 Minuteshere; it&#x92;s intended to give viewers a better sense of the man behind the franchise, which it does.  Much of the footage from this interview is sprinkled throughout some of the other featurettes. Meanwhile, the character behind the franchise, Robert Langdon, is examined in his own featurette, as is Sophie Neveu. The cool thing here is getting under the skin of the actors to see how they approached the characters, knowing that most of the movie-going public already has formed their own ideas about the characters from the book.The most interesting extras are the featurettes that focus on the history behind the mystery. Or is it the mystery behind the history?  Either way, the first one on theMona Lisa, and the second featurette on the many codes and symbols that are hidden throughout the movie balance out the remainder of the extras nicely by demonstrating the sense of intrigue, mystery, and game-playing adventure that madeThe Da Vinci Codeso popular in the first place.--Daniel VanciniBeyondThe Da Vinci CodeThe Films of Tom HanksThe Films of Ron HowardThe Da Vinci DVDs: Decoding \"The Da Vinci Code\"More About The ArtistStills fromThe Da Vinci Code(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00005JN5E", "B0013BM63O", "B002ZTQVKM", "B0007XG02W", "B001OLP2TI", "B002C68WNW", "0307474275", "B002O5M4SU", "B00005JLSB", "B000PHVZNE", "B0077ATSSQ", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000EPR7NE", "0743486226", "B001LMAK9W", "B000P0J0EW", "0385504209", "B005HWAOP2", "B001OQCV2E", "B0013XZ2QK", "B001EZE5D8", "B00005JL3T", "B000EOTW0Q", "6304711891", "B000YDBPAM", "0307950689", "B000HT386M", "B00008G8M4", "B000P0J0EM", "B002ZG99KO", "0800141806", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00001ZWUS", "B0002V7OI8", "B002O3Z50Q", "B0006GANOQ", "B002NZK5UU", "B000NQRR1Q", "0385504225", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00005Y71F", "B000OYC7BW", "B00DL48BM6", "B00026ZG10", "B0018CWW5K", "B00004BZIY", "B0000B1OFL", "B00023B1LC", "B000N6U0E2", "B00A8MGIZG", "B00005JM5E", "B002LMV7R0", "B00004Z4WR", "B000K2UGXO", "B00005JMYC", "B001MVYUQG", "B00005JLWN", "B000056PMU", "B0000AOV4I", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00441GYXS", "B001F12J0C", "B00ES28X3C", "B002ZG980U", "B001VLBDD0", "B00008K76U", "B001TK80C0", "B008JFURII", "B000VWYJ86", "0792159659", "B00AEFYGBA", "B0009MDPYM", "B00177YA1K", "B00005N5S5", "B0043X1FM2", "B0002J58HO", "B00005JM5B", "B00AZMFJYA", "B003AWRMBA", "074349346X", "B003VA3JUO", "0783240295", "6305767866", "B0000844I8", "B000065U1N", "B002GHHHKQ", "B000K7VHQE", "B0000AXE8I", "0800177258", "B000ASDFGI", "B003Q6D2B4", "B000HRMAPE", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JMOW", "B00GPWEPZ8", "0312944926", "B000VI70QS", "B000KF0GWW"], "bought_together": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00005JN5E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00I563DSC", "B0013BM63O", "1400079152"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7555}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.5, "brand": "DaVinci", "asin": "B00005JOC9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SLBDLMtIL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Da Vinci Code (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)"}

But just like that, they're once again transported to a fantastical land, but one with a long-abandoned castle. It turns out that they are in Narnia again--and they themselves lived in that castle, but hundreds of years ago in Narnia time. They've been summoned back to help Prince Caspian (Stardust's Ben Barnes, resembling a young, cultured Keanu Reeves), the rightful heir to the throne who's become the target of his power-hungry uncle, King Mraz (Sergio Castellitto). And he's not the only one threatened: Mraz's people, the Telmarines, have pushed all the Narnians--the talking animals, the centaurs and other beasts, the walking trees--to the brink of extinction. Despite some alpha-male bickering, Peter and Caspian agree to fight Mraz alongside the remaining Narnians, including the dwarf Trumpkin (Peter Dinklage) and the swashbuckling mouse Reepicheep (voiced by Eddie Izzard). (Also appearing is Warwick Davis, who was in Willow and the 1989 BBC Prince Caspian.) But of course they most of all miss the noble lion, Aslan, who would have never let this happen to Narnia if he hadn't disappeared. Prince Caspian is epic, evoking memories of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films. (Some of the battle elements may seem too familiar, but they were in Lewis's book.) And it's appropriate for kids (Reepicheep could have come out of a Shrek movie), though the tone is dark and there is a lot of death, albeit bloodless. After two successful films, Disney and Walden Media's franchise has proved successful enough that many of the characters are scheduled to return in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. --David HoriuchiStills fromThe Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian(Click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004M1A21K", "B000E8M0VA", "B0047H7Q22", "B000LPS4J8", "B000OYCM5I", "B003ZHR6TS", "B00AEBB8KQ", "0061992887", "B00139W3NE", "B001NPD9JA", "B0016Q2D5M", "B00005JM5E", "0060598247", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00HFFE8HE", "B004OBQDFM", "B002ZG99PY", "B000I0RQVI", "B001APZMJS", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00BEZTMFY", "B002ZG9904", "B005COPWZW", "B0011U52E2", "B00J0BTEZM", "B00AEFY9RG", "B008D1RDL2", "B0001HAISG", "B006VRRGNK", "B0013BM63O", "B00AEFYIQ8", "B00JBV4R3U", "B005LAIISA", "B001DHXT20", "B008JFUNTG", "B001HN694K", "B001QB5SS6", "B000AAF1TU", "B000GUJZ00", "B0013FSL3E", "B0012IWO0I", "B002ZG97YM", "B0000959N0", "B004AKCME8", "B000VNMMQG", "B0006GANV4", "B000Q66FB6", "B000HEWEE4", "B003HARV3Y", "B00CWM58WY", "B003L20IJM", "B002IPFWTE", "B00005JKZY", "1416995978", "B00005JG6M", "B000VBJEEG", "B001LPWGBO", "B008JFUO72", "B00128VA76", "B0009NZ2KG", "B00028HBES", "B0000640SC", "B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6", "B00I6JOD2S", "B00JK531ES", "B004EPYZUS", "B001LXIDVS", "B004SIP75S", "B00005JN5E", "B004A8ZWUQ", "B004A8ZWW4", "B006P0FIGU", "B001NE80P4", "B00E5I2M6I", "B003ZHVJGO", "B000VWYJ86", "B002BWP49C", "B00275EHJG", "B00003CXC3", "B002ZG99KO", "B0030IIYYS", "B0006FYOTC", "B00EV1YZ96", "B00005JN4W", "B005LAIIMG", "B008JFUQ16", "B005LAIIPS", "B000BB1MI2", "B0030ZIZRC", "B0000DZ3EN", "B000W746GK", "B000UR9T8C", "B002PMV9FG", "B000BJ7BCK", "B00006ZXSK", "B001KVZ6FW", "B007R6DJP8"], "bought_together": ["B000E8M0VA", "B004M1A21K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004M1A21K", "B000E8M0VA", "B003ZHR6TS", "0061992887"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3310}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.68, "brand": "Walt Disney Video", "asin": "B00005JPH2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/618uTYKkadL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian"}

{"description": "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's Endis a rollicking voyage in the same spirit of the two earlierPiratesfilms, yet far darker in spots (and nearly three hours to boot). The action, largely revolving around a pirate alliance against the ruthless East India Trading Company, doesn't disappoint, though the violence is probably too harsh for young children. Through it all, the plucky cast (Keira Knightley, Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush) are buffeted by battle, maelstroms, betrayal, treachery, a ferocious Caribbean weather goddess, and that gnarly voyage back from the world's end--but with their wit intact. As always, Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow tosses off great lines ; he chastises \"a woman scorned, like which hell hath no fury than!\" He insults an opponent with a string of epithets, ending in \"yeasty codpiece.\"!In the previousThe Curse of the Black Pearl, Sparrow was killed--sent to Davy Jones' Locker. In the opening scenes, the viewer sees that death has  not been kind to Sparrow--but that's not to say he hasn't found endless ways to amuse himself, cavorting with dozens of hallucinated versions of himself on the deck of the Black Pearl. But Sparrow is needed in this world, so a daring rescue brings him back. Keith Richards' much ballyhooed appearance as Jack's dad is little more than a cameo, though he does play a wistful guitar. But the action, as always, is more than satisfying, held together by Depp, who, outsmarting the far-better-armed British yet again, causes a bewigged commander to muse: \"Do you think he plans it all out, or just makes it up as he goes along?\" As far as fans are concerned, it matters not.--A.T. HurleyOn the DVDHere's something you can't say about just any DVD extras: There appears to bemoreof Keith Richards in the outtakes, interviews, and other special features on theAt World's Enddisc than in the actual film. For those scenes alone, this special edition is well worth the price. Richards looks as woozy and gamey as all the rumors suggested, and answers questions he's not asked, with Johnny Depp sitting next to him, almost acting as a translator. Richards offers pithy comments like, \"Everything I do is original, you better believe,\" and smiles when other cast members call him \"Two-Take Richards\" for supposedly nailing his scenes.The packed second disc also includes a terrific mini-doc on how the filmmakers created the famous maelstrom, in an enormous hanger in Palmdale, California, with the ships floating 30 feet off the ground. \"Just moving theBlack Pearlwas an enormous undertaking,\" says producer Jerry Bruckheimer with serious understatement. Other cool extras include \"Tale of the Many Jacks,\" deleted scenes with great commentary, \"The World of Chow Yun-Fat,\" a bio of composer Hans Zimmer, features on the set designers, a look at the impressive Brethren Court, and some hilarious bloopers. \"You can't curse in a Disney film,\" deadpans Depp when a costar blurts out something blue. \"See? I told him.\" The extras are truly as much of a rollicking adventure as the film.--A.T.

{"description": "You know you're going to get a different kind of superhero when you cast Robert Downey Jr. in the lead role. AndIron Manis different, in welcome ways. Cleverly updated from Marvel Comics' longstanding series,Iron Manputs billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (that's Downey) in the path of some Middle Eastern terrorists; in a brilliantly paced section, Stark invents an indestructible suit that allows him to escape. If the rest of the movie never quite hits that precise rhythm again, it nevertheless offers plenty of pleasure, as the renewed Stark swears off his past as a weapons manufacturer, develops his new Iron Man suit, and puzzles both his business partner (Jeff Bridges in great form) and executive assistant (Gwyneth Paltrow). Director Jon Favreau geeks out in fun ways with the hardware, but never lets it overpower the movie, and there's always a goofy one-liner or a slapstick pratfall around to break the tension. As for Downey, he doesn't get to jitterbug around too much in his improv way, but he brings enough of his unpredictable personality to keep the thing fresh. And listen up, hardcore Marvel mavens: even if you know the Stan Lee cameo is coming, you won't be able to guess it until it's on the screen. It all builds to a splendid final scene, with a concluding line delivery by Downey that just feels absolutely right.--Robert HortonStills fromIron Man(Click for larger image)&nbsp;", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00E5I2M6I", "B008JFUO72", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00E5I2MEK", "B0083SBMBM", "B008JFUS0U", "B001CDR1FG", "B00E5I2MAO", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001GCUO1Q", "B008JFUPFI", "B000VI70QS", "B000HEVZ9E", "B0000959N0", "B00005JKCH", "B00005JNJV", "B00005JNTU", "B0090SI56Y", "B000VR0570", "B00005JMQW", "B002HWRYJE", "B0007P0Y7C", "B004LWZW42", "B00D7OMNXS", "B001OQCV6A", "B007K3JFUQ", "B004EPZ07K", "B004LWZWGA", "B000UR9T8C", "B0083SBJXS", "B0060FXDCG", "B002IPFWTE", "B00E5I2ME0", "B00IXD2MGQ", "B000AYELVA", "B00C6B8TB8", "B008QZ5PY2", "B000OVLBF8", "B000AYELVU", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001QB9H1U", "B009JBWOU0", "B001AK3S4Y", "B001GZ6QC4", "B005G4TJUC", "B002NXSRVG", "B000HCO83Q", "B003YOZNBU", "B003Q6D2B4", "B00023B1LC", "B0002IQMAM", "B008JFURII", "B00HERGM86", "B00E5I2MDQ", "B006VRRGNK", "B002ZG99QS", "B00000JQB5", "B007REV4T8", "B00008G8M5", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B0002ZDVEU", "6305718954", "B001DTPZNY", "B005LAIGW8", "B001F7MSFM", "B001GCUNWQ", "B00A2H9P98", "B000RW3VDE", "B002O5M4T4", "B00005JA8B", "B005LAIIPS", "B005LAII44", "B00BEIYHO2", "B000GUJZ00", "B00005N5S5", "B002SJIO4A", "B000VWYJ86", "B004EPZ0BG", "B0049IHX2C", "B00AEBBAEK", "B00005JM5E", "B008JFUOWM", "B000FS9FCG", "B00005PJ6N", "B00979KQFO", "B00AEFXKUI", "B002K0WBXW", "B0042U94UQ", "B004EPYZUS", "B008JFUQZ2", "B0084IG8TM", "B001DJLD1M", "B008JFUS5A", "B00006HBUJ", "B000J103OI", "B00F84H73Q", "B0087ZG7NO", "B000U1ZV8K"], "bought_together": ["B00E5I2M6I", "B008JFUO72"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008JFUO72", "B00E5I2M6I", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2MEK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12121}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "DOWNEY,ROBERT JR.", "asin": "B00005JPS8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515wjJQt2nL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Iron Man (Ultimate 2 Disc Edition)"}
{"description": "Here's hoping James Mangold's big, raucous, and ultrabloody remake of3:10 to Yumaleads some moviegoers to check outDelmer Daves's beautifully lean, half-century-old original. That classic Western spun a tale of captured outlaw Ben Wade (Glenn Ford)--deadly but disarmingly affable--and the small-time rancher and family man, Dan Evans (Van Heflin), desperate enough to accept the job of helping escort the badman to Yuma prison. Wade, knowing that his gang will be along at any moment to spring him, works at persuading the ultimately lone deputy to accept a bribe, turn his back on \"duty,\" and go home safe and rich to his family. That the outlaw has come to admire his captor intriguingly complicates the suspense.All of the above applies in the new3:10, but it takes a lot more huffing and puffing to get Wade (Russell Crowe this time) and Evans (Christian Bale) into position for the showdown. Mostly, more is less. To Mangold's credit, his movie doesn't traffic in facile irony or postmodern detachment; it aims to be a straight-up Western and deliver the excitement and charisma the genre's fans are starved for. But recognizing that contemporary viewers might be out of touch with the bedrock simplicity and strength of the genre--not to mention its code of honor--Mangold has supplied both Evans and Wade with a plethora of backstory and \"motivations.\" At the overblown action climax, the crossfire of personal agendas is almost as frenetic as the copious gunplay. (By that point the movie has killed more people than the Lincoln County War.)Best thing about the remake is Russell Crowe's Ben Wade, a Scripture-quoting career villain with an artist's eye and a curiously principled sense of whom and when to murder. As his second-in-command, Ben Foster fairly pirouettes at every opportunity to commit mayhem, and Peter Fonda contributes a fierce portrait of an old Wade adversary turned bounty hunter for the Pinkerton detective agency.--Richard T.

{"description": "In this inspirational costume drama, Michael Apted (49 Up) recounts a period in British history sure to be unfamiliar to most Americans. In fact, his eye-opening biography of 18th century abolitionist William Wilberforce (Ioan Gruffudd) is likely to come as a revelation to many Britons, as well. After all, despite the presence of his wife, Barbara (Romola Garai), this isn't a particularly \"sexy\" story, but itisa powerful one. The title comes from John Newton's hymn \"Amazing Grace\" (\"I once was lost but now am found\"). Newton (Albert Finney) was a former slaveholder, who became a clergyman and spent his days repenting. While America had John Brown, England had Wilberforce, and Newton is one of many who helped the MP to abolish slavery in the UK. The story begins towards the end of Wilberforce's mission when he's sick with colitis and addicted to laudanum. Apted continues to alternate between 1797 and 1789, when Wilberforce was fitter and more idealistic, and ends in 1807 as his efforts come to fruition. Apted and writer Steven Knight (Dirty Pretty Things) do right by their hero. UnlikeAmistad, however, slaves are largely off-screen, with the exception of author Equiano (Senegalese vocalist Youssou N'Dour).Amazing Gracereserves its focus for the politicians who risked their reps for the greater good, like Wilberforce and Prime Minister Pitt (an excellent Benedict Cumberbatch), and those more concerned with the income slavery provided their constituents, like Lord Tarleton (Ciar&#xE1;n Hinds) and the Duke of Clarence (Toby Jones).--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Son of FrankensteinBasil Rathbone comes to Transylvania to inherit his father's estate in this second sequel toFrankenstein. The townspeople are suspicious, but young Frankenstein has no interest in reviving his father's work--until he discovers the monster hidden away in the castle, inert but very much intact and watched over by Ygor (Bela Lugosi), a sinister, snaggletoothed peasant with a broken neck. Convinced to revive the creature and vindicate his father's name, Frankenstein toils away in the lab not realizing that Ygor plans to use the monster to revenge himself on the jury that sentenced him to hang. Boris Karloff makes his final appearance as the Monster, now little more than a mute, lumbering robot under the hypnotic control of Ygor. Rathbone is a dignified, suave scientist and a marvelous match to Lugosi's mad Ygor, a richly malevolent performance that dominates the film. Lionel Atwill makes a marvelous addition to the Frankenstein gallery as the wooden-armed constable, a legacy of the monster's rampage 25 years before. (Mel Brooks's loving lampoonYoung Frankenstein, a veritable remake of this film, features the constable and his lumber limb in a major role.) Universal abandoned horror films in 1936, but the success of this sequel single-handedly revived the genre. Though lacking the gothic splendor and macabre humor of James Whale's originals, Rowland V. Lee's handsome production remains an intelligent, well-made classic of the genre and Universal's last great horror film. Lugosi returns as Ygor inThe Ghost of Frankenstein.The Ghost of FrankensteinThe monster lives! Again! Picking up whereSon of Frankensteinleft off, Bela Lugosi's gnarled Ygor survives yet another rampage by angry, torch-carrying villagers and frees the monster (The Wolf Manhimself, Lon Chaney Jr., taking over from Boris Karloff) from his sulfur grave. The latest cinematic Frankenstein scion, brain surgeon Ludwig (Cedric Hardwicke), wants to dissect the creature, but the ghost of his father convinces him to save it by giving it a new, \"good\" brain. Ygor has his own devious plan and enlists Ludwig's shady assistant (Lionel Atwill) in a brain-switching scheme.Ably directed by the pedestrian Erle C. Kenton,The Ghost of Frankensteingives up the gothic mood and moral quandaries of the original films for the busy, action-packed plots that defined Universal horror films of the 1940s. The human characters are all rather dull (except for Lugosi's animated, eye-rolling performance), and Chaney has none of Karloff's pathos or subtlety under the make-up, but the film opens with a spectacular bang as the villagers dynamite the castle, and skips from one inspired scene to another. The monster rejuvenates himself during an electrical storm with a jolt of lightning, mutely undergoes a courtroom cross-examination (by a ridiculously intent Ralph Bellamy), and finally goes on a blind rampage in the fiery climax. Frankenstein's monster returns (this time with Lugosi as the creature) inFrankenstein Meets the Wolf Man.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005LC4K", "B00005LC4J", "B00005LC4N", "B00005LC4M", "078323502X", "B00005LC4O", "B006TTC5J0", "B00000JMOF", "B0000694WM", "B00001TZ6Q", "B00000JQB7", "B00000F62P", "0783233582", "B00005NSXY", "B003M8NGG2", "B000035Z3K", "B0016586Q8", "B000WNHTCC", "B0009X770E", "0783240961", "B0001CNRLG", "B000FWHW8Q", "B000U1ZV7G", "B0007R4T26", "B00B94VJYW", "B00000ILEU", "B000FWHW90", "B001B9ZVVC", "B005D0RDKM", "0783240953", "B000EHQTZO", "B0009X770O", "B002945DUW", "B000FVQLKW", "B00005KHJP", "B000063UR0", "B00D9EJFZA", "B0000694WH", "B000A0GOEQ", "B00LC4PFOY", "B00005R1O7", "B00009NHC0", "B000A0GOFA", "B000UAFDR0", "B008FL8OTK", "B00D9EJFV4", "B0013XZ6SY", "B0002NRRQU", "B000EHSVJG", "B000A1INIA", "B005AMJ3B0", "B000062XEY", "B000UDGOBG", "B0001HAGTM", "B00009NHBC", "B000FOPPEC", "B0000AUHOK", "B005FQ2H0A", "B000GRUQJW", "B00HFWETZ8", "B0034PWPHY", "B00000K3U3", "B00009PY4D", "B00KTFJ50M", "B007Y1NNAW", "B00006G8K0", "B000VX9WB4", "B00AEBB8VK", "B005ETANC2", "B00DOZNGC2", "B00LC4PBTS", "B00HRUQ8X4", "B0001CNRNE", "B009KG7F30", "B00006G8JZ", "B0000AUHOO", "B00K1L4NBU", "B000095J42", "B000068TPF", "B00KTZALDC", "B000AQKU72", "B00009PY38", "B009AGEY98", "B0001CNRLQ", "B0007R4SZY", "B002TSAAS8", "B002DY9KQG", "B000RXVNDI", "B000QGEB1W", "B0002NRRRY", "B0016LFUVQ", "B00HRUQ7WG", "B0087ZG7RK", "B00DNUSFUG", "B0045HCJS0", "B002VEWMGS", "B005ETAN7C", "B00IE41A9O", "B000A0GOFK", "6305944288"], "bought_together": ["B00005LC4K", "B006TTC5J0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B006TTC5J0", "B00005LC4K", "B00005LC4N", "0783233582"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 19304}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.2, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

{"description": "America's first family of dysfunction, the Simpsons, appear in all their depraved glory in this wonderful DVD compilation of their show's premiere season. Fans accustomed to the slick appearance of the later episodes will be delighted by the rougher nature of these earlier episodes, when the characters weren't as well defined (Homer isn't quite as dumb as he is in later seasons) and the animation was still evolving.

Throughout the season, familiar faces are introduced, as we catch first glimpses of Smithers, Mr. Burns, the Flanderses, and Patty and Selma. Highlights of the season include \"The Crepes of Wrath,\" in which Bart is sent to France as an exchange student (\"Don't mess up France the way you messed up your room\"); \"Bart the Genius,\" in which Bart ends up in a school for the gifted; and \"Krusty Gets Busted,\" in which Bart's lifelong animosity with Sideshow Bob begins.--Jenny Brown", "related": {"also_bought": ["B007KFZ7UQ", "B007KFZ8AK", "B007KFZ8B4", "B007KFZ8AA", "B000067DNE", "B007KFZ7YM", "B007KFZ7Q0", "B007KFZ7PG", "B007KFZ87S", "B007KFZ88M", "B001GQ3GHG", "B0024FAR52", "B001L1S1PI", "B003KZ27N0", "B005QIOJ3A", "B000WGYMD8", "B000WGYMGK", "B000BQPC42", "B009DW5YJI", "B00F4NPBI4", "B00023P49C", "B0012KSUTA", "B00009N80Z", "B000E6ES9O", "B002R8JE7S", "B000083C6V", "B009DW5X0I", "B008412UKA", "B003KZ27NA", "B005QIOJ6M", "B00L89VL96", "B000NNK4DM", "B00F4NPBAC", "B00008YGRV", "B00005JM3G", "B000B5XOWU", "B00008YGRS", "B00JDFTN60", "B0006Z2L2Y", "B0002PYS60", "B0000CABL2", "0062267752", "B007ZFR67I", "B00023P49M", "B002DKGWSE", "B000HT3P6U", "B0072BNKHA", "B0077ATSSQ", "B001E6HUXO", "B00AIANIPQ", "B001MVWRNE", "B001VFM0ZG", "B00JNB80YU", "B00HX14C7Q", "B000ADWCYY", "B0006Q93CO", "B00008EY6Q", "B008JFUO0Y", "1612185916", "B0000C2IQB", "B006W93ELK", "B005LAIHY0", "B00HN9D22Y", "B00JO5LJG6", "B001FB55HQ", "B001VLBDD0", "B009SQ9Q5M", "B00C7E3E7S", "B001AQO3QA", "B0024FAD9W", "B002N5N5SO", "B000EQHXOG", "B009LDD40U", "B001CK1D44", "B003Y5H5EW", "B0014Z4OMU", "B00I099K4U", "B003L77GDS", "B00JHH1VUU", "0785154620", "B00BUWD7Y8", "B000ELJAEM", "B005LAIIMG", "B002FOQXTQ", "B008MCKL5W", "B00IMIGWD6", "B00DQC2FPM", "B0087ZG7HK", "B00GZ0ML4C", "B00AO686MY", "B001QIVEVE", "B00005JG6M", "B0001I561E", "0385352107", "B00I0VTPWA"], "bought_together": ["B007KFZ7UQ", "B007KFZ8AK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007KFZ7UQ", "B007KFZ8AA", "B007KFZ7YM", "B00F4NPBI4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 70952}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 23.24, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B00005ML6Y", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P2P9TQYCL._SX300_.jpg", "title": "The Simpsons: The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "It takes nearly an hour for anything unusual to happen inWith a Friend Like Harry, but that first hour is oddly unsettling. German filmmaker Dominik Moll reveals the trouble with Harry (Sergi L&oacute;pez) with low-key precision, his thriller sensibility channeled from Hitchcock through Claude Chabrol, while emphasizing casual conversation in the style of Eric Rohmer. Harry's found Michel (Laurent Lucas) in a public restroom, identifying himself as an old schoolmate who remembers far too much about Michel, even though Michel has no recollection of Harry at all. But Harry's an ingratiating type, and nice enough on the surface, so Michel invites Harry and his girlfriend, Plum (Sophie Guillemin), to the summer cottage he's renovating with his wife, Claire (Mathilde Seigner), and their three young daughters. The Spanish actor L&oacute;pez (fromAn Affair of Love) modulates his performance so carefully that Harry's psychosis--never explained, but strangely compelling--reverberates well beyond the film's shocking conclusion. It turns out Harry's been a helpful friend after all, but that's cold comfort in a film that warns us against the kindness of strangers.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CXCF", "B004NWPY3E", "B000055YV3", "B00CUKTHES", "B00003CXZ4", "B00006L91I", "B000296E7W", "B00003CXBZ", "B0000C9JFO", "B000K2V7F0", "B000E33W0I", "B0000A1HQP", "B009B8YMB0", "B004YCKKH8", "B00D954ACC", "B001CIOCLC", "B0087IT8FK", "B00005JLRE", "B00006G8G3", "B001FOPOD8", "B0064NTZQ2", "B00006RZ2W", "B00421IR5I", "6304907729", "0792846443", "B000BC8SWO", "B00B9LNQ0U", "B003ZYU3U0", "B0009GX1CE", "B000069HZP", "B004SEUIXS", "B000FGGNA0", "B007TMYL3O", "B000LPS4FC", "B0001EFV9A", "B0009IWFCY", "B0009PW45A", "B008XAT1A4", "B001SJ5X2M", "B00006IUHF", "B0001GH5S8", "B005UNI2XY"], "bought_together": ["B000296E7W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0031RAOVY"]}, "price": 19.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 120900}, "asin": "B00005NTN4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517Wa%2BWP5WL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "With A Friend Like Harry"}

{"description": "Warping into syndication in 1987,Star Trek: The Next Generationsuccessfully launched its seven-season \"continuing mission\" of the starshipEnterprise, and this classy DVD boxed set gathers the show's inaugural  season in crisp picture clarity and dazzling 5.1-channel sound. A ratings leader  with a sharp ensemble cast, this revampedTrekhonored series creator  Gene Roddenberry's originalTrekconcept, nurtured by returning veterans  like producer Robert H. Justman and writers D.C. Fontana and David Gerrold.  Several first-season episodes have original-series counterparts, and while the  season was awkwardly inconsistent for all involved (including Roddenberry's heir  apparent, producer Rick Berman), in retrospect the series began on remarkably  solid footing.Patrick Stewart was perfect asEnterpriseCaptain Jean-Luc Picard, while  Marina Sirtis struggled with a wretched hair bun and an ill-defined character,  eventually blessing Counselor Troi with delicate nuance. Denise Crosby made a  strong but underutilized impression as Security Chief Tasha Yar, and left the  series before season's end, allowing writers to develop Klingon Lieutenant Worf  (Michael Dorn) into a fan favorite. Brent Spiner transcended Spock comparisons  with his triumphant portrayal of the android Lieutenant Commander Data; and  while Jonathan Frakes was accepted as First Officer Will Riker, fans ultimately  rejected Wil Wheaton as ensign Wesley Crusher, the teenaged son of the ship's  doctor (Gates McFadden). Still, these 25 episodes laid a firm foundation for  subsequent seasons, and highlights include the Raymond Chandleresque \"holo- novel\" of \"The Big Goodbye,\" Data's backstory in \"Datalore,\" the Klingon rituals  of \"Heart of Glory,\" and a Romulan encounter in \"The Neutral Zone.\" The DVD  supplements (all on the seventh disc) are good enough to make anyone wish for  more: four featurettes recall myriad first-season challenges, filled with  insider perspective and enoughNextGentrivia to satiate all but the most  obsessive Trekkers back on Earth.

{"description": "HBO's violent men-behind-bars drama is an addictive, testosterone-driven soap opera for guys. The eight episodes of the first season set the style for the show: a massive cast of a vivid characters on both sides of the bars, four or five stories unleashed at a breakneck pace and framed by angry, oddball introductions, and a soaring casualty rate. Created byHomicideproducer Tom Fontana, this drama quickly earned its rightful reputation as the most brutal show on TV. It's simple chemistry: combine volatile ingredients in a confined space, shut tight, and shake.The yellow brick road of the Oswald Correctional Facility (affectionately known as \"Oz\" among the inmates) leads to \"Emerald City,\" an antiseptic cellblock of cement and glass overseen by prison-reform advocate Tim McManus (Terry Kinney). The first episode introduces its two most compelling inmates: meek lawyer Beecher (Lee Terguson), who transforms from a vulnerable lamb to a fearless, drug-addicted wildcat, and Muslim activist Kareem Said (Eamonn Walker), a fiercely non-violent leader whose campaign for reform explodes in a season-climaxing riot. The stunning first-season cast also features Ernie Hudson (the warden), Rita Moreno (a worldly drug-counseling nun), and Edie Falco (who jumped from her role as a single-mother prison guard to mob wife inThe Sopranos). It carries no rating, but the drug use, nudity, and brutal violence make this highly inappropriate for young viewers and unsuited to the squeamish.Ozpulls no punches in its portrayal of prison violence and predatory abuse.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000FBH2", "B0000Y40PW", "B00031TYBC", "B0009GV9E6", "B000G1R4TS", "B0002ERXC2", "0060521333", "B0006IUD9Y", "B00A2JP6V2", "B00123BY6S", "B004YOEDR4", "B000FTCLSU", "B00316DDYA", "B000QXDJLI", "B00003CXOP", "B005SEDI5M", "B0001KL5DA", "B0012CJQY6", "B000NA1VI2", "B00DJYJRHG", "B005NFJAWG", "B0007R4SWM", "B00005NOHO", "B00G4EWJ1O", "B008PJZDXW", "B001OQCVFG", "B0007YMVWO", "B000067S1G", "B000Q6GUW0", "B00008PW1F", "B002ZCY8CC", "B0015TX2LO", "B000BO7DWI", "B002N57KGM", "B0020TS5EM", "B0009NZ2W4", "B000LC3ID8", "B00C8CQRQ4", "B00HW3EXCE", "B002FLOTPE", "B00EEDNR9A", "1484177010", "B0024FAD92", "B004BZ5AHI", "B0009IW88K", "B00B52F278", "B0002I84JO", "B00005RIY5", "B003XWEQ8E", "B0028RXXE8", "B000FKO3GW", "B0012CJQYG", "B003PIUBZS", "B00ADQPB50", "B00188XHF8", "B0034G4OSG", "B009TE9HAW", "B00004XPPB", "B000CRR31U", "B0012CJQZ0", "B008H6GHF6", "B001FB4W0W", "B00CWIMVDW", "B000CR7RCK", "B0024FAD9C", "B000E6EK42", "B00EIL7E9C", "B004HW7JMO", "B0012CJQYQ", "B0024FAR5M", "B000EULSR0", "B002N5N5M0", "B001AQMBF0", "B000GH3CWK", "B000XCZGXG", "B0019NJW0G", "B00DXP7L88", "B0060MYKYY", "B009LDD54K", "B0014FAIV6", "B000Q6GUKW", "B000GTLQVW", "B00CG4XKNM", "B000V86OKG", "B00JF5GAZA", "B0055SNHQG", "B00B5J6A7W", "B002N5N5QQ", "B006OB3K56", "B0041KKZKA", "B0072OFM28", "B000NVI2GU", "B00004U103", "B00BGI076M", "B009PNHSYY", "B00ECHBSP8", "B007TBIUSM", "B00A4Y61NM", "B002N5N5MK", "B00382S9T6"], "bought_together": ["B00000FBH2", "B0000Y40PW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000G6BL42", "B0000Y40PW", "B00000FBH2", "B0009GV9E6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10670}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 27.99, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B00005Y6YJ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51UjJ5OPyNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Oz: Season 1"}

{"description": "Three Dorothy L. Sayers mysteries involving amateur sleuth extraordinaire Lord Peter Wimsey and the lovely Harriet Vane are realized to perfection in these 1987 BBC adaptations. InStrong Poison, Harriet (Harriet Walter) is on trial for murder. Lord Peter (Edward Petherbridge) becomes enchanted by her and decides she cannot possibly be guilty. What follows are the twin stories of Lord Peter's search to find the real killer and his romantic pursuit of Harriet. Both are charming. As always, Sayers has plotted her story brilliantly, with a satisfying mystery and a sly comic touch (a gentle poke at the spiritualist movement is particularly fun). The period atmosphere is pulled off naturally and with close attention to detail, and the adaptation has a careful reverence for Sayers'snovel. The performances are all remarkably strong. Petherbridge is perfect as Wimsey, revealing his brilliance and allowing him to be hopelessly in love without ever damaging his dignity. Walter plays Harriet with rich nuance, saying as much with her silences as she does with her lines, and Richard Morant is quietly fantastic as the remarkable Bunting.Harriet, fresh from the trial, tries to get away from it all and ends up stumbling over a recently killed body inHave His Carcass. Unable to resist a crime (or, for that matter, Harriet), Lord Peter is soon on the case. InGaudy Night, Lord Peter is still proposing at frequent intervals, and Harriet, though unable to say yes, is also unable to send Lord Peter entirely away. But enough with the romance. As Wimsey heads off for some foreign service work, Harriet visits her Oxford alma mater and lands smack in the middle of a poison-pen scandal. Harriet's status as a mystery writer, naturally, means she's the one who should investigate. Sayers clearly had fun writing this one, using Harriet to gently tweak her own profession, at the same time both parodying and defending the cloistered life at a women's college.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00BDSRM4K", "B00008DDXE", "B00A0HT99G", "B0001DMUF4", "B00A8KJLPM", "B0038M2SBQ", "B002TY78PU", "0062275488", "B00BVMXARG", "B00JJRLFTU", "B00GAXASKS", "B00GWXI20E", "B004HHX9H8", "B001HZ4K80", "B000068UE9", "B00GAXASLC", "B00A27O5AW", "B00GHH9I62", "B00GWXI2RM", "B00IBKXP8A", "B00KCA32XK", "B005DVIPY4", "B003YCI1UC", "B00199PPCO", "B00GWXI1F0", "1250017440", "B00HHYF55C", "B00HYZ0ZLS", "B00GWXI16O", "B001V7UXG2", "B00H4ZEFTQ", "B004ZEDJLE", "B004AV5H2G", "B00GWXI2MC", "B00EV1YZD2", "1250002591", "B00008K772", "B009DS3VQA", "B00J3M54AW", "B003X2P9B2", "B005GP7EVC", "B00GWXHYPI", "B008OTTTP6", "1250017432", "B009DS5OEM", "B00IK481FO", "B002MUAXJY", "B00BCXW106", "006219657X", "B001D7T6N6", "B00KL3TSC2", "1250032792", "B00HUAGYF8", "B00009WNVN", "B00HHYF548", "B00BEZEDNU", "B00A27OJ94", "B0011VJRVU", "B000F4RHBG", "B00HGE90Z4", "B009DS6YGO", "B00JPJC8RK", "B00C888LOO", "B00IT3KP96", "B0002HOERQ", "B008CYDE7C", "B0050N0US4", "B001FBPSW8", "B000199JJS", "B0006Q93EW", "B009D4RW96", "B00K6DQGC2", "B00E44EZUE", "B00A8KJMP6", "B00KL3TS8G", "B00GAXASK8", "B00A0HT9HI", "0312674546", "B0028AEO0M", "B00B89X0CW", "B000CRR36K", "B001ROVUTI", "B009D4SFEC", "B009DS31ZG", "B0001WTUK8", "B000KF0DVQ", "B008RO6PJQ", "B0023Y543Y", "B00GWXI28Q", "B005A1GRSI", "B001UWOLQG", "B00BQXTCVS", "B000AOEMUU", "B004ZEDJLY", "B00FPPQYXM", "0062311913", "B00ANGICPG", "B003AND1TG", "B002XTBEE2"], "bought_together": ["B00BDSRM4K", "B00A8KJLPM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BDSRM4K", "B00A8KJLPM", "B00A0HT99G", "0062275488"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9980}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 42.56, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000062XDX", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51s4vzkWPHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dorothy L.

{"description": "Retelling a story that has made it onto the silver screen more than most, this latest adaptation of The Count of Monte Cristo makes yet another swashbuckling attempt to win over a new generation of cinema goers. A dashing James Caviezel takes the role of the Count, who is driven by a desire for revenge after being betrayed by his best friend Fernand (played by a dishevelled Guy Pearce) and landed with 16 years of solitary confinement in Chateau D'If, a damp cavernous prison. Thus the scene is set for a good old-fashioned romp. The trouble with this \"re-imagining\" (to borrow a phrase from Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes) is that it's never quite sure whether to take itself seriously or not. Alexandre Dumas's original story is a traditionally melodramatic tale of deceit and double-crossing, with clear-cut bad guys and a moral lesson to be learned at the end. Here, director Kevin Reynolds appears unsure about whether to stick with tradition or bring the story up to date and turn it into a post-modern play on the old Victorian values and style. When the Count and his heavy-breathing loved one are reunited, their kiss is actually framed as a cameo. Both lead actors are also prone to heavy bouts of overacting, garnishing their performances with exaggerated baroque gestures. Clearly this is a film in which the actors could over-indulge themselves and (almost) get away with it, were it not for the fact that--bar Richard Harris as the \"Priest\"--none of them seem to have the faintest idea about how to conduct themselves in a period drama. This Count of Monte Cristo will leave the audience a little confused as to whether they should cry along with the story or laugh along with the actors. --Nikki Disney On the DVD: The Count of Monte Cristo on disc offers no escape from the dry drawl of director Kevin Reynolds, who features in almost every element of the extensive extras package.

Left adrift when her willful daughter (Moira Kelly) leaves home, the polite, poised widow dotes over the darling 6-year-old son (Jake Lloyd ofThe Phantom Menace) of her foul-mouthed, working-class neighbor (Marisa Tomei). The girls form an unlikely friendship, and the easy way these opposites find a comfortable space is one of the film's pleasures, as is Rowlands's grandmotherly way with the boy and G&#xE9;rard Depardieu's shy romancing of Rowlands. Cassavetes focuses on the rhythms and relationships of these people, and they make good company, sometimes at the expense of a meandering story, but ultimately the film belongs to Rowlands's middle-aged survivor, who learns to stop wrapping her life around others and start living for herself.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00014NEBW", "B000LSAIYE", "B004B93RGU", "B000N4SHOE", "B008B9JTFO", "B003EA45EU", "B0000C2IR0", "B004QB8TGG", "B000AGTQ18"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007PXYVMI", "B0000C2IR0", "B000089731", "B00112S8RS"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 84072}, "asin": "B000069I1W", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51REKFEMXRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Unhook the Stars"}

At 77 minutes it overstays its welcome, yet its goofy preposterousness is so sweet-natured that you'll probably develop a grudging fondness for it. Gibson Frazier, with his crackerjack musical-comedy moves and long, sharp-edged, comic-strip face, plays an aggressively chipper newspaperman named Johnny Twennies--a cross between the go-getters Harold Lloyd played in silent comedies and the motor-mouth hipsters perfected by Lee Tracy and Jimmy Cagney in the early talkies. Johnny wears '20s duds, writes on a vintage typewriter, sends telegrams instead of e-mail--yet he's living in modern-day New York City. He doesn't register anything that wouldn't have fit into the world of those movies from which he appears to have sprung: for instance, that his girlfriend (Susan Egan) is horny as a bedbug, or that his photographer sidekick (Anthony Rapp) is gay. None of these comic ideas comes to much, but Frazier (who cowrote with director Adam Abraham) can really dish out the snappy patter, and the black-and-white camerawork is the bee's knees.--Richard T.

{"description": "South Parkexploded on the pop culture landscape like a dirty  bomb in 1997, and the 13 episodes that comprise the groundbreaking first season  have lost none of their subversive impact.

Like an After School Special gone quite mad,  profanity-spewing third-graders Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and the ill-fated Kenny navigate  childhood in their mountain town. Nothing inSouth Parkis sacred, and  each episode has something to offend, from \"Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride\"  (featuring George Clooney as the voice of Sparky, the homosexual dog), to the  Halloween episode \"Pink Eye,\" in which Cartman dresses up as Adolph Hitler. Best  not to even get started on Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Pooh, or the season finale  cliffhanger, \"Cartman's Mom Is a Dirty Slut.\"Each episode is preceded by a faux introduction by creators Trey Parker and Matt  Stone, who proclaim every episode to be their favorite. Their incarnations as  Rootin'-Tootin' Trey Parker and Pistol-Slingin' Matt Stone indicate that afterSouth Parkruns its course, they'd be great hosts of their own children's  show, which--and this cannot be stressed strongly enough--South Parkisnot. Other extras include theSouth Parkboys' appearance on the  CableAce awards and \"A South Park Thanksgiving,\" featuring Jay Leno, which aired  exclusively onThe Tonight Show.

{"description": "Stephen King's The Shiningis a new adaptation from the author himself, made for television, that bears very little resemblance to the 1980 Stanley Kubrick version. That's not surprising since Kubrick threw out most of King's novel and presented his own version of the story. Here King redresses the balance in a miniseries that follows his original almost to the letter, and manages to be effectively creepy despite the budget and censorship limitations of the TV format.Stephen Weber takes over the role of Jack Torrance, the caretaker who slowly descends into madness in the haunted Overlook Hotel. His performance is as far from Jack Nicholson as you could get, with his insanity building slowly and menacingly rather than being virtually mad from the get-go. Rebecca De Mornay is superb as Wendy Torrance, struggling to hold her fragile family together amid the spooky goings-on. Young Courtland Mead plays Danny, whose unique gifts give the story its title, as one of those infuriating TV brats who overacts left, right, and center. Fortunately, there are enough creepy moments and a number of frights to hold the whole thing together, the woman-in-the-bathtub scene being a standout shocker. Sure, there is nothing quite like Nicholson's \"Here's Johnny!\" moment, but this is the story King wanted to tell and it still shines brighter than most of the other recent screen adaptations of his work.--Jonathan Weir", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002VWNIDG", "B00BW4S8AC", "B0002OXVG4", "B000063US5", "B00006FDCD", "B0000C2IQQ", "B000G1R39E", "B00000F3SB", "1573625779", "B000GYI340", "B000UJ48WC", "B006J8NPAE", "0307743659", "B00BW4S87U", "B00AMXSFRK", "B00AEBB91E", "0790742829", "B000U1ZV6W", "B000053UIF", "B00AEFYV9W", "B0001FVDQ4", "6305120021", "B00009OWI3", "B0002O7XW2", "B0007WFXNA", "B002NZK5SM", "0385121679", "B000GBEWRU", "B00A1AU72A", "B0010X73ZG", "B000TJ6PBK", "B00IYJRIKO", "1451698852", "B00AEFXR8I", "B002BE7JEI", "B00AEFYYH6", "B000H4JH7Q", "B00005JOJE", "B0007NFMB2", "143919260X", "B000RIWAVW", "0792846443", "B008RO875Q", "B002ZG971U", "B00BEIYGFC", "0767821599", "B00D6I7EGQ", "B00005K3NR", "B001KKU9CI", "B00CLA3Y2I", "B000068IES", "B007XF0W9E", "B001U0HBQA", "B001AR0D4A", "B00BEIYMIS", "B004LWZW24", "1476754454", "B00BEIYG98", "0307743640", "B000S0GYRU", "B001GD6VTE", "B00029RTCG", "B00GNAO70K", "B003UGLCIA", "B005LAIGOQ", "B00005LC4Q", "B0012KJ0DK", "1476727651", "B0009UZG46", "B0009X75EC", "B00BEIYMAG", "0783225547", "B0045HCJJE", "B0002CHK1S", "B0030IIZ56", "1476770387", "630523650X", "B003VS0CWO", "B0089J2818", "B00DII0MGI", "B00HRUQA6O", "B000LP6KNU", "B00AEBB8NI", "B004LWZWGA", "B0087ZG7UW", "B004A8ZWVU", "B0000JBALO", "0451167538", "1451627297", "B000EHSVOG", "B004QBWU02", "0451169514", "B000CMHWKW", "B00AO686MY", "B00004W46I", "B00E3QJ7FG", "B00HWWUQYY", "B00HHYF570"], "bought_together": ["B002VWNIDG", "B00006FDCD"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002VWNIDG", "B008QE9Z8A", "B00006FDCD", "B000063US5"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8457}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B000077VRT", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MMf-6xyeL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Stephen King's The Shining  (Two Disc Special Edition)"}

Ian Carmichael returns in his signature role as Dorothy L. Sayers's aristocratic sleuth in this characteristically impeccable 1973 BBC miniseries. The chaotic advertising agency is a ripe setting for intrigue (Sayers herself worked in a prominent London ad agency in the 1920s). Wimsey has a high time masquerading incognito as the firm's new copywriter, as well as the mysterious costumed Harlequin, a ruse he adopts to obtain information from the notorious socialite Dian de Momerie (Bridget Armstrong), whose lovers (Dean, among them) all come to bad ends, and whose den of iniquity is fronted by Major Milligan (Peter Bowles, ofTo the Manor Born), a drug dealer who corrupts bright young things.Among the pleasures of a Wimsey mystery is his panache with the niceties of our English tongue.

{"description": "Dirk Bogarde risked his career to make this 1962 film about a lawyer who risks his career to stand up to blackmailers. Part crime thriller and part plea for tolerance,Victimuses the terror of a blackmailing ring to point out the injustice of Britain's antisodomy laws. Bogarde plays Melville Farr, a married lawyer who learns of a blackmail scheme when one of its victims, an old friend, commits suicide rather than tell the police. As Farr conducts an investigation, he must confront his own past.Victimwas ahead of its time--it was the first English-language movie to use the word \"homosexual\"--and as such it seems quaint and stilted at times. Straw-man clich&#xE9;s about homosexuality must be knocked down, and, like in all first-wave issue movies, occasionally characters need to have rather stilted debates. Still, the crime plot stands on its own, the performances are excellent, and the film is brave enough to make some very good points.

{"description": "This Sundance Festival sensation has attracted attention because of its jarring images of Amish kids immersed in debauchery: plain-dressed girls in white bonnets slugging back beers and flicking ashes from their cigarettes, boys passing out in the back of pickups after all-night parties, even Amish teens in bed together. But like a good drama, it's the characters themselves and their heartbreaking dilemma that linger in the mind. In the Amish vernacular, \"Devil's Playground\" refers to the \"English\" or outside world. The protected teens are suddenly thrust into this world upon their 16th birthday as they begin \"Rumspringa,\" a period during which they decide whether to join the church as adults. Crystallizing this predicament is the 73-minute documentary's most compelling figure, 18-year-old Faron, a preacher's son fighting drug addiction. His earnest intent to return to the church and astonishing articulateness makes his misadventures in the drug underworld and penal system undeniably poignant.--Kimberly Heinrichs", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00652U6JM", "B00GMM19QE", "B003V3FSO6", "B00C4BDG7M", "B00584A7MY", "B003E697N8", "B000EOTEKY", "B0000DHFZY", "B000KLQUV2", "B000YVB2NO", "B0000SXK0Y", "B000HWXVSY", "B000WTVZG2", "B0024EWP6W", "1421408910", "B004NJC0NY", "B001O7R74K", "B000A2XCBC", "B0002JNREU", "B0006ZYPIW", "B0006UG09O", "B004C6YGRG", "B003VWC4BW", "B006GRWCF2", "B008220DGE", "B00AEBB9UK", "B008NNY98U", "0978731646", "6305692572", "B002MZZT8E", "6303297811"], "bought_together": ["B00652U6JM", "B00584A7MY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003V3FSO6", "B001IZID8W", "B005BYBZR2", "B00584A7MY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 155754}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 62.99, "brand": "", "asin": "B00007GVM0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J5J3HVMQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Devil's Playground"}
{"description": "In 1966-67, with 100,000 meters of black-and-white film and freedom to shoot without a script, director Vilgot Sj&#xF6;man created a motion picture so rangy and multilayered that it became two separate, overlapping movies released a year apart:I Am Curious YellowandI Am Curious Blue.  Those are the colors of the Swedish flag, and   Sj&#xF6;man's film tapped into the political, social, and psychosexual condition of his nation on the eve of worldwide cultural revolution.It also became a envelope-pushing event in the history of sex in the cinema.  A feisty, rather zaftig actress-activist named Lena Nyman played a radical activist named Lena Nyman who, in between interviewing her fellow Swedes about everything from gender inequities to the morality of vacationing in Franco's Spain, spent lots of raunchy time in bed (and elsewhere).  The copious frontal nudity and a glimpse of oral-genital contact ensured an epic court battle in America, andI Am Curious Yellowbecame a must-see conversation piece.Decades later, it all seems not only fresher than it did then but oddly tender, even sweet.  Sj&#xF6;man, 42 years old to Nyman's 22, cast himself as her lover (which he was) as well as her director, and the film is occasionally \"interrupted\" by its own filming.  Sj&#xF6;man/\"Sj&#xF6;man\" has to watch Lena/\"Lena\" doing some very intimate things with costar B&#xF6;rje Ahlstedt.  B&#xF6;rje is playing a car salesman, but also playing \"himself\" as an actor sometimes intriguing against his director with \"Lena\"--not \"Lena the activist\" but \"Lena the actress,\" both of whom Lena the actress-for-real is playing.  The Pirandellianism is witty, raw, and lingeringly ambiguous.

{"description": "Don't let the title fool you:The Sleeping Dictionaryis the most seductive argument for foreign-language education a boy ever had. Hugh Dancy is a young and idealistic colonial official posted to Britain's deep-jungle Sarawak outpost in 1939, and Jessica Alba (Dark Angel) is the \"sleeping dictionary,\" a sexy tutor who proves that the fastest way to learn a language is through lovemaking. Guy Jenkin trades in old clich&#xE9;s for new ones in his revision of the exotic old melodramas of forbidden love between handsome colonial men and gorgeous, guileless native girls. Alba's accent slips and slides but she's a sweet, sexy, and beguiling presence, while Bob Hoskins and Brenda Blethyn uphold the all-important appearance of British morality. If you can overlook the contrivances, it makes for a lush romantic fantasy about the triumph of love over the hypocrisy of so-called civilized society.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00561BNJK", "B00LHVZIT4", "B003U6SJY0", "B0030Y12FU", "B000092OPT", "B008220A62", "B000Y7U93C", "B000V6LSOA", "B0009KQP32", "B003CRM6RI", "B000RW3VDO", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B0001CNRS4", "B00GRZPRB4", "B000ZS8GW6", "B0010X740A", "B000Z8H0IC", "0767812115", "B000O77SMW", "B000O77SN6", "B000M2E32M", "B00006JU8B", "B004SIP9Z6", "B0002JZT5A", "B000OCY7TY", "B00000K31T", "B00441GYVA", "B0000D0YXV", "B00IKM5LXG", "B0007W6HVM", "B00174RCHW", "B0037QGS0A", "B009H3LP82", "B0015XHQVW", "B00979KQD6", "B006Z7Z3VS", "B006OV7RQ4", "B001F0TM4Y", "B000F3UAFC", "B00ET2ODU8", "B00005JPXC", "B00EVU3T26", "B00EI3YG0K", "B002DQSKMY", "B000FJGWBC", "B00E1LT41K", "B005FLSZQU", "B000A2W1X2", "B004MCT2BA", "B006M3M5FM", "B0000639G5", "B00A47BT7C", "B00ET2ODTE", "B0039PGHAK", "B00D3DJI3Q", "B009L79YRI", "B000GI3KGC", "0788815490", "B001Y8DJVE", "B00EMAGKNU", "B00C8CQ5SO", "B00005JNTU", "B00008AOVI", "B001AR0D5Y", "B0002YLCG0", "B000FS9UKI", "B001GLFPWK", "B001C5LLVE", "B00DPUB56U", "B000QUEQ4K", "B007IJKQRS", "B00005R87R", "B00003CXPV", "B0040J1RX6", "B00AEBB86U", "B00004WZ0B", "B00CRFQUDW", "B00CPTUO1Y", "B005Z9MGRG", "B0086FKSWQ", "B001U0HBQA", "B000HT38EO", "B000A2X3U2", "B0045HCJIK", "B001AZKB8K", "B00C3JUKHE", "B0006D3HCY", "B0000ZMGWK", "B00FRILRW0", "B00E8G5H8W", "B004EPYZNK", "B0007939VG", "B00DVD5SBE", "B000BBOUUE", "B0016I0AKU", "B002UJIY98", "B0000AUHQ6", "B0009WDVUK"], "bought_together": ["B00561BNJK", "B003U6SJY0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003U6SJY0", "B00561BNJK", "B0030Y12FU", "B008220A62"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 132150}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 21.67, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00007LB4B", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515RS9C42QL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Sleeping Dictionary"}

{"description": "Hey, troops, let's put on a show! Befuddled, uptight John Cleese reluctantly commands the Song and Dance Unit South East Asia, a motley troupe of barnstorming performers who dress in drag to entertain the commie-fighting British jungle troops in 1948 Malaysia. Based on the satirical stage revue by Peter Nichols (Georgy Girl), the oddball mix ofCarry Onfarce, military buffoonery, and backstage shenanigans makes an awkward transition to the screen. Behind the double entendres and broad gay caricatures (especially Dennis Quilley, who embraces his flamboyance with gusto as the unit's musical director and star performer) rumbles a murky political satire of the British Empire in decline. The idea is better than the execution, but even as a curiosity it has its moments.

{"description": "The hypocrisy of the U.S. government is powerfully scrutinized inDistorted Morality, a scathing thesis presented by renowned scholar Noam Chomsky. Speaking before an intimate audience at Harvard University on February 6, 2002, Chomsky sets fair and logical parameters to his thesis (namely, we areallhypocrites and, for the purposes of debate, the U.S. government shouldalwaysbe given benefit of the doubt) before outlining, with academic precision and citation ofrealhistory (as opposed to biasedwrittenhistory), the reasons why America's post-9/11 war on terror is a logical impossibility.This, according to Chomsky's carefully supported analysis, is because the U.S. government has been, and continues to be, a major supporter of state-supported terrorism, favoring retaliatory or preemptive aggression over mediation in the world court, and avoiding accountability by excluding itself from the globally accepted definition of terrorism. (To underscore his point, Chomsky repeatedly volunteers his sources, inviting scrutiny at every turn.) With an additional hour-long Q&A; session (in some ways more compelling, since it offers Chomsky's response to opposing viewpoints),Distorted Moralitydeserves the widest possible audience. In the short period between Chomsky's Harvard speech and the start of America's war against Iraq in March 2003, Chomsky's thesis has attained the chilling status of prophesy.

{"description": "One of the first \"Japanimation\" series to air in the U.S.,Speed Racer(Mach Go Go Go) debuted in syndication in September 1967.  Eighteen-year-old Speed Racer wants to become a race car driver, but his  father, automotive engineer \"Pops\" Racer, \"blows a gasket\" at the idea. Pops,  who designed the amazing Mach 5, relents when Speed demonstrates his  extraordinary driving skills. He embarks on a series of fantastic adventures  that pit him and his friends against Skull Duggery, Snake Oiler, Mr. Wiley,  and the Alpha Gang. With their wide chins, large mouths, and small eyes, theSpeed Racercharacters reflect the influence of contemporary  Hanna-Barbara series, rather than the indigenous style the Japanese animation  industry would later develop. Members of Gen-X who grew up watching the  original show will enjoy this \"collector's edition\" that offers the first 11  episodes, a theme song sing-along, a villains' gallery, and an interactive  demonstration of controls of the Mach 5.

{"description": "The fourth series ofDeep Space Ninecan be summed up in one word: Klingons! The show's producers apparently felt beset from all sides.Babylon 5was a huge hit, as wasStar Trek: Voyager, the flagship of new channel UPN. Stepping upDS9's action quotient seemed to be the answer. Time would tell, however, whether doing so viaTrek's tried-and-tested former bad guys was the best solution. Opening with a special two-hour extravaganza, the new year was immediately unfamiliar. Dennis McCarthy's original theme--despite winning an Emmy--had been deemed too subdued. As its upbeat new rendition kicked off, the station was seen in battle and swarming with activity. Moments later, we met old/new crewmember Worf, whose sudden appearance was the result of a brewing invasive strategy by the Klingons. This initiated the first of many loyalty shifts, as the Cardassians became the victims. With plenty of re-appearances by Gowron, Kor, and Kurn, it was clear that an ongoing space opera was being crafted. Dukat revealed a tragedy-ridden daughter; Odo's relationship with his people (and Kira) became increasingly melancholy; and even the Jem'Hadar foot soldiers were given a sympathetic angle by their drug addiction.Adding to the layers of ambiguity about Earth's (read: the producers') position over being at war, was the \"outing\" of two recurring characters as rebel activists. Lest we forget the homely/spiritual side of the Captain, time was spent with a future version of Jake, with his father (Brock Peters), and on the nature of his role as \"the Emissary.\" Avery Brooks worked behind the camera a couple of times, but this year the surprise was LeVar Burton directing five shows. There was still time for comedy: the Ferengi warped back to Roswell in 1947 and Bashir played James Bond. But the year will be remembered predominately for its violence. One of the episodes Burton directed had its fight scenes drastically cut, while the series as a whole won an Emmy for its space battle effects.--Paul Tonks", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008KA59", "B00008KA5A", "B00008KA58", "B00008KA57", "B00008972H", "B00005JLF5", "B0002JP4GE", "B0002WZTCA", "B000228EBS", "B00062IDCO", "B00062IDLA", "B0001NBNFW", "B000127LW2", "B000A6CLL0", "B0009I7NGW", "B000AOEMXC", "B0007TKH66", "B00BHWG0DQ", "B00BHWG0CM", "B000063V8T", "B000063V8S", "B000063V8R", "B000062XFG", "B00005Y1NF", "B00062IDDS", "B00K2CHWYI", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B004EXWGHY", "B002BAW6H2", "B002BAW6FE", "B00L4K3MLE", "B002BAW6FY", "B002BAW6GS", "B001DHXT3Y", "B00IURL19Y", "B000VDDDY6", "B00IWTVDUW", "0671501062", "B002BAW6GI", "B0017VG69U", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00HETWFVC", "B00BHWG0G8", "B003Y7JWZ0", "B001RHGRTS", "B00IUR3YI0", "B0041B77RS", "B000BOH990", "B00BHWG1AI", "B000HEWEJ4", "B000CNE0SS", "B001EHF3RS", "B000B8IA2G", "B002I9Z8GM", "B00ENFS0F0", "B00CKYHH6O", "B000AOEMXM", "B00453QOC6", "B002GP7ZW8", "B000BT96EG", "B000BNI90Y", "B002I9Z8I0", "B00077BPF0", "6305761078", "B00B7VZN76", "B00GX7D5G0", "B00BD6K54G", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00HRUQAKU", "B000LC4ZI0", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B000CNE0T2", "B000W4KT9G", "B000SNUR34", "B0042YZFYG", "B00009VTZX", "B000BOH98G", "B000UX6TKC", "B006LPHY6G", "B0095XPZBC", "B000I0QLRI", "B008D1Q1XI", "B001DF681G", "B00CDEJRDC", "B008R52LA2", "B002I9Z8GW", "B000I0QLS2", "B0024FAD7Y", "B007AFC0W4", "B0000CABIJ", "B002GP7ZVO", "B000I0QLRS", "B000EXDS34", "B001TH16DS", "6303961614", "B002HRF68A", "B00466H3A4", "B000RZIGVS", "B001C71IGU"], "bought_together": ["B00008KA59", "B00008KA5A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00008KA59", "B00008KA5A", "B00008972H", "B00005JLF5"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 27750}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 34.4, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B00008KGT0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51D4ZZXYN9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek Deep Space Nine - The Complete Fourth Season"}

Will the army of Yokai be  enough to help vanquish the dreaded Daimon, or will the villagers fall prey to an  unspeakable fate?", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000093NPD", "B00LNBQ8SI", "B00LMCDHMS", "B000F2CAJ2", "B0000AINJX", "B00I099JWI", "B00I3C1T7A", "B00I462XGG", "B00IQAUO48", "B008L0YMSW", "B00004YS8H", "0991459903", "B002DQSKLU", "B0024FAG2G", "B00IQAUO2A", "B00KDU8HQQ", "1452135398", "B00310PSTY", "B00HRUQB8Q", "B0088FS1DC", "B00I099JY6", "B00I099JO6", "B00HRUQ7WG", "B00076ON28", "B00IQAUO5C", "B00I462XNO", "B005OT7YX8", "B00I462XLG", "B00CPTUNNI", "B005ENCIWG", "B000UDGOAW", "B00IA1VKVY", "B00I099JZK", "B008Y5OXDI", "B001AR0D40", "B00JQYUZSS", "B00I462Y60", "B00022PZ2O", "B00IQAUO6Q", "B00HT2RTU6", "B000H5U5GM", "B00B2M78PU", "B007UQ8IQU", "B00J2PQZBC", "B00JQYUXY4", "B003WKL6XA", "B00JB08O76", "B0035CVB30", "480531219X", "B009ERJY6G", "B000MV8AJU", "B00C7E3EDW", "B002WBYDMQ", "B0000VAGXK", "0767847431", "B00004TJJV", "B000E1BXFG", "B00003L9CE", "B007NYZ9YI", "B004TPJNAA", "B0096W46VW", "B00A429Y56", "B00480OC0C", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B000VNMS6K", "B004G5SOYO", "B00CPTUNWO", "B0021BSOFY", "B00009NHC0", "B00AWHDFLC", "B0001AVZ9Y", "B000A2XC3U", "B00AJXO4FA", "B003NHMYJM", "B001IOQW4A", "B000P24FAE", "B003NHMYJC", "B000OCY7IU", "B006WZIETG", "B00I462X7K", "B006WNMI0Y", "B00003CXLS", "B0009YA3SQ", "4805312149", "B00003L9CB", "B009ERK122", "B000TZN7KQ", "B003CNQPMO", "B00BNAE2AU", "B000LPQ6DO", "B00B04NJCG", "B00960EHRC", "B0016KCCCC", "B006JN87CU", "B00012L77W", "B009IV2Z3M", "B000W7Y6FQ", "B004HHX9OQ", "B0006IIPSA", "B00125WAW8"], "bought_together": ["B000093NPD", "B000F2CAJ2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000093NPD", "B000F2CAJ2", "B003NX4GRY", "480531219X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 206414}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.24, "brand": "", "asin": "B00008OTTK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NC136BWXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Yokai Monsters: Spook Warfare"}
{"description": "It was a short but sweet fifth season forSex and the City, as HBO's resident comediennes found themselves affected by forces beyond their control--the pregnancies of both Sarah Jessica Parker (Carrie) and Cynthia Nixon (Miranda). A truncated shooting schedule to accommodate the actresses forced this season to be reduced to a mere eight episodes, and indeed, you can tell both actresses are expecting. (Carrie's wardrobe became more outlandish and more concealing than usual.) Still, the actresses and creators forged ahead, creating a handful of episodes that if short in content were long on emotion and laughs. Whereas the fourth season found all four grappling with various relationships, the fifth season focused on the perils of being single, with a new intensity lacking in the previous sexcapades. Carrie and Miranda wrestled with their solitary lifestyles, albeit with new attachments--Miranda had new baby Brady and single motherhood, while Carrie found herself in the world of publishing as the author of a real-life book of her columns. Charlotte (Kristin Davis) wondered if she'd ever find another man, while Samantha (Kim Cattrall) finally got rid of the one that had been vexing her far too much, hotelier Richard (James Remar). If the season as a whole felt less than the sum of its parts, those parts were some of the best comedy in the show's history, from Samantha's anointment as the \"Michiko Kakutani of vibrators\" to Carrie's stressful, one-degree-from-fiasco book launch party. (And fear not, Chris Noth's Mr. Big does pop up now and again.) The season's climactic episode, \"I Love a Charade,\" found all four at the straight wedding of a seemingly gay pal (Nathan Lane) and contemplating their future with a wry, bemused tone. It was one of the series' best episodes ever, equally touching and funny, and grounded the show in an emotional maturity that announced that after all their wild travails, these women had truly grown up.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00382S9U0", "B00382S9UA", "B00382S9T6", "B00382S9SW", "B00382S9SM", "B00AYVDUPW", "B00004RFCM", "B00005AVCA", "B001DDBCUA", "B002ZG98Z0", "B006WZIB1C", "B00AQ5RRJQ", "B001675YWK", "B0002SDY1W", "B005IFIUEU", "B00AS870P2", "B0013FSL16", "B00IKX4LEK", "B001PQZYQI", "B002ZG98ZA", "0743457307", "B00079FUI6", "0446617687", "B001DDBCV4", "B002PJ4HNK", "B001675YW0", "B000P6YNTI", "B000FIMG4U", "B0018CWEYO", "B001VPJYZK", "B001VPJZ0O", "B0001CCXZW", "B003F3NE1Q", "B003CN5SAY", "B00D8H3LR6", "B002BJGYTO", "B00DRSGQ7I", "B002BJGYU8", "B004EPYZRG", "B002BJGYV2", "B005IA9JRM", "B003L77GFG", "B0077PTWHI", "B000069HYG", "B0000844MI", "B004SEUJK0", "B000G1R3A8", "B00BUWD7Y8", "B0018CWEXK", "B002YBUX0K", "B005IA9JQI", "B000EMGJ7C", "B0006SGYM4", "B002VWNIBI", "B00005JMYI", "B00I458456", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00466HN7M", "B00A81MV3U", "B005LAIIHG", "B0000DIXDR", "B002K0WBXW"], "bought_together": ["B00382S9U0", "B00382S9UA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00382S9SM", "B00004RFCM", "B00382S9SW", "B00382S9T6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 53385}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 17.89, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00008PW2D", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ps3SLLDZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sex and the City: Season 5"}

So advises African American comedian and driving-school instructor Buddha Sack (voiced by Chris Rock) in the episode \"Traffic Jam,\" and in its second season,King of the Hillmines this fertile territory for some of the funniest and sharpest comedy writing on television. But it's the pitch-perfect ensemble, led by series co-creator Mike Judge as forthright Hank Hill and Kathy Najimy as the formidable Peggy Hill--that also givesKing of the Hilla heart as big as Texas itself. Hank struggles to be the voice of reason in a world that often just \"ain't right.\"In \"Hilloween,\" Hank rallies the town after a lawsuit by a fundamentalist (voiced with hellfire by Sally Field) shutters the local haunted house and abolishes trick or treating. In \"Hank's Dirty Laundry,\" the tenacious Hank is forced to immerse himself in adult video after a video store computer's false claim that he rented and did not return \"Cuffs & Collars\" sullies his credit rating. Hank may he hard-headed, but, unlike Homer Simpson, he is never a buffoon. His literal nature provides some of these episodes' biggest laughs, as witness his attempt to one-up put-down artist Buddha Sack in \"Traffic Jam\": \"Your mother's hair is short, it looks like she's not a woman at all, but more like a man.\" In season 2, Hank continues to look for common ground with his misfit son (\"How To Fire a Rifle Without Rally Trying\"), and romance begins to blossom between Bobby and neighbor Connie (\"The Son That Got Away\"). But it is the throwaway moments that provide some of the series' giddiest delights.

The movie is a day in the life of Samantha, whose 16th birthday is turning out to be anything but sweet. All the traumas of teendom come down on one long day, which sees Samantha surrounded by dithery relatives, mooning over a high school hunk, and pursued by a sawed-off Lothario.Sixteen Candlesmarked the directing debut of John Hughes, and its goofy energy displayed a promising talent with a great ear for high school lingo ... a promise neglected since Hughes became, afterHome Alone, a one-man entertainment industry. There are some pretty crass moments (Why the stereotype of the foreign-exchange student from Asia?), but Ringwald's steady appeal smoothes over the rough spots. As the pubescent, self-styled lady-killer, Anthony Michael Hall turns in a hilarious portrait of a young swinger; he and Ringwald would reteam with Hughes forThe Breakfast Club, another key teen picture of the decade.--Robert HortonThe Breakfast ClubJohn Hughes's popular 1985 teen drama finds a diverse group of high school students--a jock (Emilio Estevez), a metalhead (Judd Nelson), a weirdo (Ally Sheedy), a princess (Molly Ringwald), and a nerd (Anthony Michael Hall)--sharing a Saturday in detention at their high school for one minor infraction or another. Over the course of a day, they talk through the social barriers that ordinarily keep them apart, and new alliances are born, though not without a lot of pain first. Hughes, who wrote and directed, is heavy on dialogue but he also thoughtfully refreshes the look of the film every few minutes with different settings and original viewpoints on action. The movie deals with such fundamentals as the human tendency toward bias and hurting the weak, and because the characters are caught somewhere between childhood and adulthood, it's easy to get emotionally involved in hope for their redemption. Preteen and teenage kids love this film, incidentally.--Tom KeoghWeird ScienceYes, that is Bill Paxton as Ilan Mitchell-Smith's militaristic big brother. And that's Robert Downey Jr. as one of the in-crowd jerks who makes nerds Mitchell-Smith and Hall's lives miserable. Fortunately, this is a John Hughes comedy and our smart nerds create the perfect woman, Lisa (Kelly LeBrock), using a computer and voodoo. Lisa is a willing sex toy, has magical powers, and just wants to help the boys get even and meet nice babes. She even cleans up. The fantasy ebullience of Hughes is given full rein here and that's good and bad (mostly good). It's all aimed at a certain kind of hormone-addled, 16-year-old sensibility; but who doesn't have a little bit of that in them?--Keith Simanton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000GG4Y4Q", "B00AG473GE", "B00AEFXXMI", "B002JOUNE8", "B0043X1FOU", "B000065V3H", "B0045O2PF0", "B000065U1Q", "B00005JKFA", "B00008DDXK", "B00AG475K8", "6305428050", "B0018QPPXW", "B005QX8UEE", "B001BGS16W", "B00005JLFA", "B00013WWT8", "B006N9OEEK", "B000P0J09W", "B00AEFXZJE", "B000PHX5NM", "B0001IN0S0", "B00029RTCG", "B0012RWQJ8", "B0053TWVQ4", "0783227388", "B00AEFYVMO", "B0002WZTOI", "0307716600", "B00402FGAS", "B0000DD76U", "B0053TWVR8", "B002XUBDRY", "B0000DIXDR", "B000068TPB", "B001HUWQJK", "B001TK80C0", "B000RJO564", "B00009OWJY", "B003J7HO5U", "B001AGXEAG", "B000ELJAEM", "0783227884", "B00027JZ3E", "B00AEFY5TI", "B003CRM6PA", "B005OK0YVG", "B0009IOR5M", "B00BTYIHWO", "B00004TJKK", "B00009PY3X", "B00441GYVA", "B00068WOH8", "B00AMEZDN8", "1933318783", "B001CK1D44", "B0054OGQM8", "B0000A02TZ", "B005CFC0N8", "B00005YU1M", "B00C6F60HE", "B003PIUIHO", "B005TMXZ0Q", "6305212112", "B000QXDCJ2", "0792844890", "B00015YVD6", "B000F5GNX8", "B001LXIDVI", "B005F96UJ6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B006TTC50Y", "B001AEF6BI", "B00AG473GE", "B001AEF6BS"]}, "price": 7.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 72193}, "asin": "B0000A98ZQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514W6AVV7ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "High School Reunion Collection (The Breakfast Club / Sixteen Candles / Weird Science)"}
{"description": "An action film rich with politics, espionage, and complicated characters,Traitoris an engrossing film in which the lines between right and wrong are anything but clear and the threats of terrorism and conspiracy across the globe seem startlingly real. Sadim Horn (Don Cheadle) is a devout Muslim, once trained and employed in engineering and explosives by American Special Forces, who has chosen to settle in Afghanistan. FBI agents Clayton (Guy Pearce) and Archer (Neal McDonough) begin investigating an uncooperative Sadim in an Afghanistan prison because of his connections with terrorist Omar (Sa&#1111;d Taghmaoui) and, as events unfold, uncover ties between Sadim and several international bombing incidents. As agents Clayton and Archer follow Sadim around the world, Sadim's dedication to his faith becomes abundantly clear, as does his involvement in an international bombing conspiracy.  What's less than clear in all the contradictory evidence is the nature of Sadim's role in the conspiracy--specifically, which side he's really fighting for.Traitoris an action-packed, suspenseful film with strong acting talent and a disturbingly real message. Bonus features include audio commentary by director Jeffrey Nachmanoff and Cheadle, an \"Action!\" featurette about the film's stunts and special effects, and a look at the production's exotic filming locations.--Tami HoriuchiStills fromTraitor(Click for larger image)BeyondTraitorTraitor + Digital Copy [Blu-ray]More from Don Cheadle -Reign Over Me (Widescreen Edition)More from Anchor Bay -Righteous Kill", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001N44BVQ", "B000Y7WGOW", "B002DU39GW", "B0015OKWL2", "B002ZG97RE", "B000OYAT3U", "B001V7UTV6", "B00102F5WK", "B0034G4OSG", "B00005JLX2", "B001MZ5W3M", "B000F7CMRM", "B003L20IG0", "B003HTSJAY", "B005LAIGRS", "B000GFLKF8", "B000F8DV1M", "B0001NBNDY", "B0010YVCB6", "B00005JKBC", "B000MZHW40", "B001BP4K22", "B000MXPE7O", "B002AT8K9W", "B0067EKYAY", "B000BYA5G4", "B004EPYZP8", "B00005JPD0", "B003JLL2R2", "B001GCUO02", "B004LWZW4M", "B004XQO90O", "B00005JN0T", "B000G5SILC", "B004IFYMWK", "B008B9JTLI", "B007QD0UQS", "B000YENUI6", "B004A8ZX28", "B00DV2MVWO", "B0062P3392", "B0019EXZY4", "B002CPMB9O", "B00HOGBXS6", "6305263248", "B002ZG97O2", "B008JFUNKU", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B00AEBB86A", "B000DZIGDU", "B001GKJ2E8", "B001TODCII", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B00005JN2Z", "B002XMGGK6", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B001FACH7S", "B00005JNQA", "B005R08HJY", "B000KLQUV2", "B001J710Z2", "B00BB67UNW", "B001UV4XGA", "B00AEBB8LA", "B001C5LLLY", "B00AEFXRRO", "B002LMV7R0", "B00KHA99BY", "B003Q6D2B4", "B001L57ZYM", "B0012QCZ5O", "B004AOECXI", "B00JA3RVG4", "B001QB9H1U", "B007REV4T8", "B00A7MSQRK", "B008E70EES", "B000VNMMVQ", "B0021L8V0M", "B003ASLJQI", "B00121QGPY", "B002ZG993Q", "B00AKGG8I2", "B007C4ZJ0S", "B00275EGWY", "B003XMKU16", "B000P0J0AG", "B000X1Z0C4", "0783226888", "B00AIBZMD6", "B000M341QE", "B0018O4YT0", "B000R4SMCW", "B00029RT9E", "B000OT6V0K", "B000BYY11Y", "B001UV4XRY", "B00E8RKHWW", "B000J4QWMC", "B00HX0KIAM"], "bought_together": ["B001N44BVQ", "B002DU39GW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007REV4T8", "B005LAIGRS", "B000Y7WGOW", "B004HO6I4M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 47173}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.99, "brand": "ANCHOR BAY HOME ENTERTAINMENT", "asin": "B0000ACOXL", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YHel2S8qL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Traitor"}

{"description": "Exceptionally moving but not the least bit sentimental,Concert for Georgeis a splendid tribute to the late George Harrison, whose contributions to the Beatles were so often hidden in the long shadows of John Lennon and Paul McCartney. A year to the day after Harrison's November 29, 2001 death, Eric Clapton assembled some musicians--people who had played with Harrison and known him intimately, including McCartney, Ringo Starr, and Tom Petty--to perform his music at London's Royal Albert Hall. They take on not just the predictable (\"My Sweet Lord\" and \"Something,\" beautifully sung by Billy Preston and Sir Paul, respectively), but also lesser-known fare like \"Old Brown Shoe\" and \"Beware of Darkness,\" all to superbly empathetic effect. But the tune most likely to make you misty-eyed is \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\" which brings together three of the five musicians who played on the original recording: Ringo on drums, Clapton replicating his own classic solo, and McCartney playing piano and harmonizing with Clapton's lead vocal.Concert for Georgeenjoyed a brief theatrical release, but even those who caught it on the big screen will delight in this two-disc DVD edition. Disc 1 features the complete concert (sansinterview and rehearsal footage, but with a few additional songs and in the original running order), while disc 2 contains the theatrical version and some additional backstage and photo material.

{"description": "Season 4 began on a high point with the Centauri Prime in the grip of the insane Emperor Cartagia (Wortham Krimmer) and a run of six shows leading to the climax of the war against the Shadows in \"Into the Fire.\" If this colossal narrative was resolved a little too easily and the ultimate aim of the Shadows turned out to be a tad disappointing, it still proved to be the most powerful slice of space opera to ever grace the small screen. In the aftermath the sheer scale dropped back a little but the pace never slowed as the rest of the season played out in one relentless cycle of conspiracy, betrayal and conflict,Babylon 5siding with the rebel Mars colony against the totalitarian Earth.Meanwhile Delenn came increasingly into conflict with her own people and, paralleling her relationship with Sheridan, Garibaldi became involved with his ex-fianc&#xE9;e Lise Hampton (Denise Gentile), while an intense platonic love grew between Ivanova and Marcus Cole. On an unstoppable wave fuelled by roller-coaster plot twists and spectacular action shows from \"No Surrender, No Retreat\"--when Sheridan avows to overthrow EarthGov--to \"Rising Star\"--when the aim is realized--Babylon 5achieved a consistent excellence rare in television. Yet within that run \"Intersections in Real Time\" stood out as a bold experiment; essentially a two-hand drama taking place entirely within one dimly lit room. Beyond this a major character died and Sheridan and Delenn married before the season finale again broke with expectation. In \"The Deconstruction of Falling Stars,\" a future descendant of humanity one million years hence reviews excerpts from the history ofBabylon 5. In one sequence set in 2762, a Brother is devoted to the preserving of history some time after the \"Big Burn.\" A homage to Walter M. Miller's classicA Canticle for Leibowitz, Sheridan and Delenn have themselves become the stuff of legend.--Gary S.

{"description": "Released almost exactly 11 years after Clint Eastwood'sUnforgiven, Kevin Costner'sOpen Rangeproved yet again that the Western istheclassic American genre. While it lacks the thematic impact of Eastwood's masterpiece, Costner's first film since 1997's ill-fatedThe Postmanreturns the actor/director ofDances With Wolvesto the open prairies of America--in this case the free-range frontier of 1882--where legal \"free-grazing\" cattle drives were falling prey to empire-building land-owners. In the wake of territorial murder, free-grazing cowboys Boss (Robert Duvall) and Charley (Costner) seek vengeful justice against the ruthless rancher (Michael Gambon) who threatens their law-abiding survival. A feisty ally (the late Michael Jeter, in his next-to-final film role) and a doctor's sister (Annette Bening) offer support during climactic shootouts, masterfully staged with the shock and suddenness of real-life gunfire. Rich in character development and thick-hided humor, this handsome production redeemed Costner's directorial career with a well-told story (by Craig Storper, based on Lauran Paine's novelThe Open Range Men), flawless performances, and stunning Canadian locations.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000GFRI4K", "B0018PH3L0", "B000E5N6LG", "6304711905", "B001LRJH0U", "B004AOECXI", "B00116GEJS", "B0038EGD3I", "B00DZUV0M4", "B000XR9L50", "B003AWRMCE", "B00368PSKK", "B001LMAK88", "6305504024", "B00368PSKU", "B003NF97MQ", "B00005LOL0", "B003ASLJRC", "B00007G78A", "B002LII6PU", "B00AEBBA0E", "B001VC99HQ", "B003ASLJS6", "B003AWRM9M", "B003UESJME", "B002O3Z4XE", "B000BITVBA", "0767817710", "B000056H2J", "B00008IHAW", "B000059H7K", "B00005JMOW", "B0081FSMPG", "B0000YTP02", "B0045HCJTO", "B000EOTUSK", "B000W1SZBS", "B00CQ9VEDK", "B00008CMR4", "B001R0AY9Y", "B0007OY2OO", "078324021X", "0783228007", "B00AEFYSEA", "B0016OLXN2", "B00004WG2F", "B001KO1BCQ", "B00B83ROIE", "B00AEFYPHA", "B0018RWMNM", "B00A92MF6Q", "B004AOECTC", "B00002SSKG", "B00006AUHQ", "B00AEBBA36", "B00AEBB932", "B0035JHYJI", "B00004XPPG", "B009INAI02", "B002U4UYYQ", "0792839056", "B000KF0GWW", "0783229631", "B00001ZWUS", "B00007ELF1", "B00AMDA2OY", "B0006HBZXS", "B000NOIVT0", "B0007TKNM4", "B000A2WP7O", "B000A2WAQU", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00000K0DM", "B000O599Y4", "B001PO55AA", "B00005JNP4", "B000O599YE", "B00005JLV5", "B004KDYQYY", "B003Q7B6ZC", "B000P0J0EM", "B000ANVPP6", "B000O599WQ", "B001B187MU", "B007Y1NR1W", "B000059TFW", "B002O3Z510", "B00005JKZH", "B000P0J0EW", "6304698747", "B0045HCJSK", "B00AEBB8YM", "B00005JN0W", "B00IO03I6Q", "0792844874", "B000GIW9I2", "B0068FZ0O2", "078322592X", "B0006N2EZ0", "0783225725"], "bought_together": ["B000GFRI4K", "B0018PH3L0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0018PH3L0", "6304711905", "B004AOECXI", "B001LMAK88"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3051}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "Touchstone Video", "asin": "B0000TANUI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5166e3Ia3aL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Open Range"}

{"description": "As upscale sitcoms go,Something's Gotta Givehas more to offer than most romantic comedies. Obviously working through some semi-autobiographical issues regarding \"women of a certain age,\" writer-director Nancy Meyers brings adequate credibility and above-average intelligence to what is essentially (but not exclusively) a fantasy premise, in which an aging lothario who's always dated younger women (Jack Nicholson, more or less playing himself) falls for a successful middle-aged playwright (Diane Keaton) who's convinced she's past the age of romance, much less sexual re-awakening. As long as old pals Nicholson and Keaton are on screen discussing their dilemma or discovering their mutual desire,Something's Gotta Giveis terrific, proving (in case anyone had forgotten) that Hollywood can and should aim for an older demographic. Myers falls short with the sitcom device of a younger lover (Keanu Reeves) who wants Keaton as much as Nicholson does; it's believable but shallow and too easily dismissed. Myers also skimps on supporting roles for Frances McDormand, Amanda Peet, and Jon Favreau, but thankfully this is one romantic comedy that doesn't pander to youth. Mature viewers, rejoice!--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0038N9WKU", "0767811100", "B000MQC9H4", "B000YAF4MA", "B000OCZA04", "B0038N9X40", "B00AEFXYOA", "B00AEBB9WI", "B0000YTP1G", "B00AEBB8YW", "B000EMGJ7C", "B000YDBPAM", "B0000VD02Y", "B000023VTP", "B000EHRVOW", "B0009OL7Z4", "B00005JLSK", "B000XJD33O", "B0000542C9", "B00AEBB8NS", "B001ECDVK4", "B00006FMUW", "6304765266", "B004SEUJK0", "B003ASLJK4", "B0000AOV4I", "6305236569", "B002VECM6S", "B002K0WBXW", "B00008G7UF", "B000J103OI", "B0042816YK", "B00081U7HC", "6305213283", "B004SIP9RO", "B003BV8ICC", "B0015I2RT8", "078322740X", "6305212112", "B008R65XWO", "6305657947", "B0017ANAZO", "B0000JBALO", "B00EIBO8T6", "B00AEFYHVO", "B00005JNDZ", "B0099114WO", "B0088X7Z6S", "B007JNR54A", "B00005JPSM", "076784744X", "B002ZG988M", "B00386EZKE", "B000683VI4", "B00AEBB9FA", "B004EPZ070", "B00003CXSM", "B00AEFY99O", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00005JG6N", "0783226772", "B000JYW5B4", "B003Y5H574", "B0038N9X3Q", "B002GHHHGU", "B000CCW2P2", "B00004TJKK", "B0017ANB08", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B000P0J0EW", "B004SIP8LG", "B000A343RI", "079073219X", "B0045HCJJ4", "B000CCBCAS", "B000HEWEE4", "0792833198", "B000765IJK", "B0002I84N0", "B001DDBCUA", "6304907729", "B003Y5H524", "B000ENC5YW", "B0007IO6NM", "B005S9EJ14", "B004FQX5B6", "B000HEWEJO", "B0001I55M4", "B00003CXFV", "B00005JLH0", "B00DDT0JB0", "B002U4UYYQ", "B00DW5ILUG", "B00005JN3W", "B00006ZXSO", "B00007E2F5", "B004SIP9VA", "B00118T632", "B004A8ZWSS"], "bought_together": ["B0038N9WKU", "B000MQC9H4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0038N9WKU", "0767811100", "B000MQC9H4", "B00AEBB9WI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2886}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.79, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0001AVZA8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q5RC1103L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Something's Gotta Give"}

{"description": "The ranks of fictional genius gumshoes were joined by former San Francisco detective Adrian Monk (Tony Shalhoub) in the summer of 2002, and he is indeed a welcome addition. Cable channel USA Network introducedMonk, a bright comedy-drama series about an obsessive-compulsive sleuth drummed out of police work following the murder of his wife and a subsequent spike in his overwhelming neuroses. Once a rising star in the homicide department, the twitchy savant is still valuable to Captain Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine), who reluctantly calls on Monk to solve difficult, high-profile murders of judges, billionaires, police informants, and famous attorneys. Monk's talent for finding clues and seeing the big picture in criminal investigations makes him a force to reckon with, but his many phobias (germs, heights, asymmetry, and much, much else) aggravate Stottlemeyer and make Monk completely dependent on a long-suffering assistant, Sharona (Bitty Schram), a single mom who functions as Dr. Watson to Monk's Sherlock Holmes.Each of the 12 episodes included inMonk: The Complete First Seasonis a delightful mix of clever whodunit puzzler, neurotic schtick, and deepening relationships. Among the latter, the bond between Monk and Sharona is most touching, as the platonic friends, sometimes aghast at how involved they are in each other's lives, surprise themselves with the breadth of their trust and commitment. In \"Mr. Monk Goes to the Asylum,\" Monk is forced into a stay at a mental hospital, where a murderer has convinced him he's crazy; it's Sharona who makes her boss realize he's not. In \"Mr. Monk and the Earthquake,\" it's Monk who rushes to Sharona's aid when he deduces that a lying friend is about to kill her. In almost every episode, Monk is confronted with a phobic limitation he must overcome in order to save the day. The question is whether he will heal enough, one day, to re-join his old squad. For the sake ofMonk's winning formula and fans, one has to hope such good news never comes to pass.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003YLM79E", "B003YLM794", "B000F0UUTG", "B000OHZKZ4", "B0081QF6WW", "B0081QF6QS", "B0081QF6LS", "B00005JLN6", "B002NTDXS2", "B000P0I4P8", "B004FM2EQC", "B004FM2EMQ", "B0052C5EHK", "B0052C5EI4", "B003L77H1E", "B00GTZWXYQ", "B0002COTDA", "B0025X4PAQ", "B003WVJ65Y", "B000FVQLIO", "B005PPMI00", "B001QE99AQ", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B00H4ZEJCO", "B000092T3Y", "B00BD6KETC", "B0024FAD8S", "B00DZP1C0O", "B0015RRNMA", "B00ESGGAYM", "B002N5N4NA", "B001C8W7EQ", "B000A0GY0K", "B000HT3P60", "B00FMR66J0", "B003F3NDWG", "B003L77FYS", "B0019Z3P84", "B00H4ZEJAG", "B00005JLEX", "B000BF0C8E", "B000056H2F", "B0001K5GOO", "B0081QF6Q8", "B00GOC74QG", "0451220994", "0451226984", "B0037XPPAM", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B0002CX21K", "B00GOYHPR2", "B00BUWD7NE", "B000ION72Q", "B000BOH8YG", "B000GG4Y28", "B00HV0TJM2", "B00005ATZT", "B001XRLWPQ", "B00I099K4U", "B00A2XQTVY", "0739472593", "B00005JLFT", "B0012EM5EW", "B000RO6JYK", "B000RBA6CO", "B000244FDW", "B004DCM5RC", "B003INBNV6", "B0007YXRCW", "B001D2WUDE", "B000LXGXY8", "B00GOC75YW", "B005TTEG5W", "B000BGR1B4", "B0000DFZ5O", "B0002XVQSU", "B001L1S1OY", "B003R0MF1W", "B0053O89KG", "B00005JNOG", "B00H57HOSC", "B00DCG3696", "B00004RBDU", "B001JFKWE4", "B00404ME2Y", "B000FVQLQQ", "B000R7GKQE", "B000N2HD6O", "B000NDEXK2", "B000CEPE5A", "B001DMVZLW", "B001992NWO", "B009RX7IX8", "B000CQM4YM", "B0045HCJRG", "B00BGI086Q", "B00EEDNR9A", "B00IWTVDUW", "B000ICLRKC", "B004HHX9H8"], "bought_together": ["B003YLM79E", "B003YLM794"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003YLM79E", "B003WVJ65Y", "B000F0UUTG", "B003YLM794"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 57400}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 12.82, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B0001KL5IU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519P5BM473L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Monk - Season One"}

His voyeuristic scrutiny of the windows in the building next door spawns a romantic fascination with Magda, a beautiful and promiscuous older woman.

Face to face with the woman he adores, Tomek confronts his own doubt and the impenetrable mantle of cynicism and disappointment that keeps Magda unreachable from any distance.

{"description": "A complete delight for fans of psychotronic cinema and the Saturday-afternoon creature feature. Writer-director Larry Blamire has distilled every clich&#xE9; of the drive-in movie era of low-budget horror and put it intoThe Lost Skeleton of Cadavra, 90 minutes of pitch-perfect spoofing. The dialogue is marvelously insipid, and the music (taken from a stock music library) cuts in and out of the action with breathtaking suddenness. It was even shot in Bronson Canyon, location of many a cheap B-picture (one knock: the black-and-white image, shot on video, wears the eye out after a while). Aliens from Mars crash-land, setting loose a mutant, while a mad scientist re-awakens a talking skeleton that could hold the key to world domination. And don't forget Animala, a half-woman, half-animal beatnik! Rowwwr! Blamire allows it all to run on too long, yet hardcore fans of this movie world will be hard-pressed to complain.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003IRUFCA", "B003IRUFBG", "B004N5UTUO", "B000A2X3RK", "B0015LPS2I", "B00465I1BK", "B00005R1O7", "B000C20VNM", "B0000AGWK2", "B001XW7ICW", "B002TCRQRC", "B00JGR3MIK", "B005HIBWBG", "B0007R4T26", "B001PPGAN0", "B00FQPLZ08", "B00FMVV416", "B008UFUL6K", "B005TMY00K", "B001TH16HO", "6305760403", "B00C7A8WZQ", "B006YKW8WI", "B000UAFDR0", "B003WKL6XA", "B00004Y7GR", "B004RPQSNM", "B005HI4LMS", "B000TJ6PB0", "B00D9EJFZA", "B0085X315U", "B00GSTHBTK", "B001HPOJ68", "B003CNQPO2", "B000FKO3EY", "B00FERT0PK", "B003CNQPOC", "6305944288", "B000FFJZO2", "B0002W4TNA", "B009XY1X9G", "B0000648YD", "6305869367", "6305772681", "B00EMAGIKU", "B006LMRMMA", "6305772711", "6305297223", "B0052G4P26", "B0000694WH", "B00005ASPE", "B00C7E3E6E", "B0034PWPHY", "B00B0LKVIY", "B00358MG8S", "B004CZZZQI", "B00023P4UQ", "B000VJE1NW", "B0000A02TY", "B00480OC0C", "B005M5OS74", "B00DOZNGC2", "B001BSBBGC", "B00AJXO42S", "B0055CP9HW", "B000RPCJ9I", "B004KDYR20", "B004RPQSVE", "B0085A9IWS", "B000G0O5FA", "B005OT80W2", "B00BPEJWAE", "B001MEJYDW", "B00005JKEX", "B00D3DJH7S", "B00BFNJHCI", "B000E991S4", "B00508W2Z8", "B0002IQL8K", "B005VU9LO0", "B003J216K4", "B007Y1NPSM", "B000A2XC3A", "B00023P4V0", "B00317LM9W", "B0029W2V9U", "B00006II55", "B004X63SCY", "B0002V7O2Y", "B00347AIN0", "B000AM6OOY", "B008BJTZ62", "B000TGKWTO", "B007PA93YW", "B00EALTWRC", "B004TFTE86", "B0025KW29U", "B0006IIPIK", "B00005NC66"], "bought_together": ["B003IRUFCA", "B003IRUFBG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003IRUFCA", "B003IRUFBG", "B004N5UTUO", "B0000AGWK2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 52237}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 56.97, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00020HAY2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GPM1GTTWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra (Special Edition)"}

{"description": "This Emmy Award-winning powerful adaptation of John Jakes' best-seller tells the story of the turbulent events and emotions that ignited the Civil War. In the tradition of \"Gone With The Wind,\" this glorious epic focuses on the lives of two families who are geographically and ideologically placed on opposite sides of the war - The North and The South. The saga follows the families through their changing fortunes at home and the harsh realities of the battlefields until the South surrenders and the families are reunited in friendship. In the final installment, the story of the two families continues through Post-Civil War Reconstruction into pioneer Indian territories.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005OSJP", "B00E3QJ8DC", "B005CGI4O6", "B0050MB3I6", "B0001NBNGQ", "B002JVWQR8", "B001CDLATY", "B0009P42U0", "B00BAXTY7G", "B0056EBH70", "B0012E2F60", "B000XA5JWG", "B001JXPC7S", "B004HHX9T6", "B007TSV4IS", "B003MRD9KQ", "B00362GK6C", "B0000A2ZNX", "B005DEUER2", "B00005JL2W", "B00005JMLR", "B00003CXA6", "B0046ZE3LC", "B004FGA2MQ", "0800177967", "B000LC4ZBC", "B0018PH3L0", "B002M2Z3BA", "B00DW5ILF6", "B0086IMN80", "B00DZUV0M4", "B000NOK1HK", "B00116GEJS", "B003F9LS90", "0451200837", "0451200829", "B004BV7MQY", "B000T22Q9W", "B0001BRSRG", "B006VRRGOO", "B001HCWGUW", "B0038EGD3I", "B00B6OEC5S", "B00CDWQNZ4", "B00BQ7GU1Y", "B000AQ6A9E", "0451200810", "B00005JP4J", "B000GW8OA0", "B0007US7FI", "B003Q7B6ZC", "B00004XPPG", "B00001ZWUS", "B00007BKVC", "B00J3LXLNA", "B000LC4ZCG", "B0055SNHQG", "B009ERK2UI", "B00ET6LPRI", "B0000DIXDR", "B00005N5S3", "B00G6HO368", "0783230478", "B00003CXGA", "B000EOTUSK", "B00BN3DZZA", "B005XB8T68", "B002C6A6N6", "B0074JOUHE", "B003LMPKSQ", "B000S0KYTE", "B00IU6HPIQ", "B000FOPPBA", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B002NALPEK", "B00BXTDVEO", "B0051GOB2G", "B0018CMJSU", "B004AOECXI", "B000E5N6LG", "B0018O4RT2", "B001IBIHQ4", "B00KVS6YZQ", "B00009OOFA", "B00BY0EBK0", "B000AYEL6U", "B00DL48BM6", "B00ENO3RXG", "B002NZK5VO", "6304765258", "B00IVFCM2U", "B004XVMCMQ", "B00005JKU0", "B000CEXEWA", "B003AWRMCE", "B00008CMT3", "B004GSVXBW", "B0085Z6ZHE", "B0007VY404", "B00AEFY4CG"], "bought_together": ["B00E3QJ8DC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005OSJP", "B0050MB3I6", "B00E3QJ8DC", "B000AYEL6U"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 24357}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 23.98, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B0002MFGDC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RFKCaP5IL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "North and South: The Complete Collection (Books 1-3)"}
{"description": "Four years after Showtime made gay men the focus of its original seriesQueer as Folk, it was time for a little turnabout withThe L&#xA0;Word(bad title, great show). Centering around a tight-knit group of lesbians in Los Angeles, this drama was far removed from its working-class male counterpart in both style and content. While the men ofQAFenjoyed a fabulous if melodramatic life on the middle-class streets of Pittsburgh, the women ofThe L&#xA0;Wordlived it up in sunny California, with gorgeous houses, glamorous careers, and sexy wardrobes. Ironically, though,The L&#xA0;Wordadhered more to the everyday drama of ensemble shows likethirtysomethingthan the soap opera antics ofQAF, and the results were surprisingly heartfelt and effective, appropriately stylish but never over the top. There was plenty of room for titillation, but creator Ilene Chaiken fashioned from the start a show centered on characters and not just sex, aiming for the heart rather than... well, other places.The L&#xA0;Wordfocused primarily on committed couple Bette (Jennifer Beals) and Tina (Laurel Holloman), a former power-career duo who've decided to have a baby; however, artificial insemination and the changing dynamics of their relationship throw their previously happy existence off-kilter. Within their orbit are spunky journalist Alice (Leisha Hailey), sultry hairdresser Shane (Katherine Moenning), closeted pro tennis player Dana (Erin Daniels), and espresso bar owner Marina (Karina Lombard) who, in the show's most polarizing storyline, bedded the seemingly straight Jenny (Mia Kirschner) and shook up her heterosexual world. Jenny's am-I-straight-or-not? kvetching frustrated both her fianc&#xE9; (Eric Mabius) and many viewers, who were alternately irritated and intrigued by her inability to decide one way or the other. But Jenny's weakness was part ofThe L&#xA0;Word's strength: in exploring many sides of many issues, both domestic and political, it never came up with an easy answer for any of them, making the show all that more fascinating--and compulsively watchable.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009QTRVI", "B000GTJSO4", "B000TGJ8D0", "B001BN4WMC", "B001G0MFOM", "B00002CGGH", "B003YJFALI", "B00005RIY5", "B00HW3EXCE", "B000J4QWIG", "B003L77GTC", "B00166UFSY", "B005FLSZHY", "B001AQBGM4", "B005JZBPHS", "B004YM6JSW", "B004BJMEO6", "B009TE9GNK", "B008XAGN46", "B0000798EY", "B00827OWO8", "B000Q6GUKW", "B002AMVED8", "B001G0MFD8", "B000FFJYE8", "0743291336", "B00264H48E", "B003FSTN8O", "B00AFDN5Y0", "B00079FUI6", "B003L77GEM", "B00J49R0ZQ", "B00008AOX3", "B001GCUBS2", "B004EI2NM2", "B001EHDSPW", "B004N21KIC", "1573441996", "B000NA1PUG", "B003FSTN4S", "B006HAJBHA", "B00005JO9J", "0316009857", "B0001O3YLM", "B001AQR39O", "B005HMHPE0", "B001EHDSPM", "B0007DBJG4", "B000P6YNTI", "B0018CWEVW", "B003LXM1PK", "B00BI9VRYK", "B000F3UA6Q", "B0013ZGN9I", "B00FRTAZEA", "B00175G7CW", "B000QUTTPG", "B001OQCVFG", "B001QE99AQ", "B00HUCF7AO", "B002BAW6I6", "B000051XVX", "B008YRL6LI", "B000FUTVLO", "B000Q6GUW0", "B0012BS5XU", "B000FIMG5Y", "B00070EBS0", "B0002234R2", "B000E3L7F0", "B005SEDI5M", "B006CR2PAI", "B001EWDXT8", "B001VPJZ0E", "B000E5N684", "B00DYZ80S2", "B00008ZL4Q", "B000R7HRRA"], "bought_together": ["B0009QTRVI", "B000GTJSO4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005JZBPHS", "B0009QTRVI", "B000GTJSO4", "B001G0MFOM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 35696}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 17.96, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B0002MPQRS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516HWGKX5VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The L Word: Season 1"}

{"description": "Solid performances are the high point of this 2004 adaptation of L.A. prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi's book about Charles Manson's Family, the Tate-La Bianca murders, and the subsequent trial that caught the world's attention in 1969. While the1976 TV moviefocused mainly on Bugliosi (here played by Bruno Kirby), writer-director John Gray turns his film's attention to cult member Linda Kasabian (a typically fine Clea DuVall), who eventually testified against Manson (a mannered Jeremy Davies) and his followers after they were arrested for several brutal murders, including actress Sharon Tate. Gray gets chilling turns from Allison Smith, Marguerite Moreau, and Mary Lynn Rajskub as \"Manson Girls\" Patricia Krenwinkle, Susan Atkins, and Squeaky Fromme, respectively, and the production is atmospherically photographed, but the dialogue is often ham-fisted, and rushes to an all-too-early conclusion (midway through the trial). The DVD offers the 180-minute film in a 1:78:1 anamorphic transfer, and includes a brace of deleted scenes (including some violent moments cut for TV broadcast), commentary by Gray and executive producer Mark L.

Nicholi, in which the backgrounds of Freud and Lewis (born a generation apart) are compared and contrasted for formative experiences that drove one man toward a science-based atheism (Freud's conclusion that belief in God stems from childhood fear and helplessness) and the other away from atheism toward Christianity (Lewis's assertion that one can reject religion and find a personal path toward God). Through dramatized scenes featuring actors playing Lewis and Freud, the show simulates a kind of give-and-take between these deeply influential men. Somewhat less interesting are interspersed excerpts from a roundtable discussion, moderated by Nicholi, among various people (writers, filmmakers, etc.) who talk about their own experiences of faith.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["074324785X", "0822224933", "B001GLLLFU", "B0002US528", "0743202376", "0783113315", "B000E6ES7Q", "B00GPOYX76", "0470651717", "0060825782", "B001GOEY9M", "0800626834", "1583310584", "B0036BDPP2", "B000R3X3FO", "B002M3SHTO", "B00028G6LC", "B00003CXC9", "B001C19HNM", "B006PTL1QM", "0830838457", "B000BITUBG", "0830838503", "B003WKQ45U", "B0047H7Q22", "1107639271", "B00078XGP6", "0060652969", "0300105967", "B002XAZ87K", "0898704529", "B005LLX582", "B000G1ALMA", "B000VHY8DW", "B002UJIY8O", "B0028YW3B0", "0525952454", "1624052185", "B000BITUFM", "B0012M1KWC", "0060652926", "B0002HRKVS", "B006JY3OHW", "B00078XGPQ", "1107604702", "0849942969", "0891075615", "0745953719", "1589973240", "B005GP7ELW", "0470453761", "015676248X", "0446579807", "1414339356", "0800626796", "B0041ETK2A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["074324785X", "0822224933", "B0002US528", "B001GLLLFU"]}, "price": 16.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 221013}, "asin": "B0002Y4SXO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z29XMR4HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Question of God - Sigmund Freud &amp; C.S.

{"description": "Love was in the air at the beginning of the second season ofGilmore Girls, as both Gilmores found themselves in the midst of perfect, giddy relationships--or so they thought. Lorelai (Lauren Graham) had accepted the proposal of English teacher Max (Scott Cohen) and was excitedly planning her first wedding; Rory (Alexis Bledel) was back on happy footing with townie hunk Dean (Jared Padalecki) after a dust-up near the end of season one that prompted a mini-break for the teen twosome. However, series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino had anything but smooth sailing on the horizon for her heroines, giving Lorelai a severe case of cold feet and Rory a major distraction in the form of Jess (Milo Ventimiglia), the bad boy newly arrived in town. Soon, Rory found herself extremely attracted to Jess, while Lorelai rekindled the flame of passion that once burned long ago with Rory's father, Christopher (David Sutcliffe), who made his way back into her life despite a girlfriend in the wings.After the minor romantic speed bumps of thefirst season, the introduction of actual conflict into the second season ofGilmore Girlshelped give the happy-goofy atmosphere of Stars Hollow a decided tension, as Rory tangled with her emotions over Jess and began the first tiny steps away from her good-girl persona. The episode \"A-Tisket, A-Tasket,\" centered around the annual town auction of picnic baskets, was a wonderful portrait of Rory's conflicting adolescent feelings for both Dean and Jess. However, it was Lorelai's simmering chemistry with former flame Christopher, only hinted at in the first season, that gave the show its energy as well as its heartbreak, culminating in the stellar season finale \"I Can't Get Started.\" But lest you thinkGilmore Girlswas centered only on romance, the second season also gave the expansive ensemble cast many hilarious moments, ranging from the hallway politics of Rory's private school to the town antics that shaped the Gilmores' daily lives. Through it all, the appealing Bledel and the radiant Graham exuded wit, charm, and a way with snappy patter not seen since the golden days of '30s screwball comedy.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002BJGYTY", "B0001CCXZW", "B002BJGYTO", "B002BJGYV2", "B000G1R4SY", "B000N6TYLW", "B00B1LKXV8", "B00006JIBS", "B003F3NDOE", "B00B5AAW52", "B005IA9JSG", "B005IA9JQI", "B003TY2SWC", "B0044LYRFA", "B005IA9JQ8", "B003SNJXMC", "B006363QHE", "B002BAW6I6", "B004STBFPS", "B00BGI05Y6", "B00684J49U", "B000XS3EFW", "B001L1S1OO", "B001JAHQ1Q", "B004MPRNAE", "B00CO9JPOC", "B0007US79Y", "B005IA9JVI", "B0077PTWY6", "B00382S9TQ", "B0050MB5P2", "B001VPJZ0O", "B0006SSMWE", "0060557818", "B001JAHQ1G", "B000NA1PUG", "B000068CNX", "B003SNJO5S", "B005IA9JRM", "B008FTX6MM", "B004132HZS", "B009LDCXNY", "B004LWZW4M", "B00A8KJN8M", "0804170703", "014242417X"], "bought_together": ["B0001CCXZW", "B002BJGYTY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001CCXZW", "B00B5AAW52", "B002BJGYTY", "B002BJGYTO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 94845}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.2, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0002Y4TOM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KRySO6O8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gilmore Girls: Season 2 (Digipack Packaging)"}

{"description": "Sex and the Cityis based on Candace Bushnell's provocative bestselling book. Sarah Jessica Parker stars as Carrie Bradshaw, a self-described \"sexual anthropologist,\" who writes \"Sex and the City,\" a newspaper column that chronicles the state of sexual affairs of Manhattanites in this \"age of un-innocence.\" Her \"posse,\" including nice girl Charlotte (Kristin Davis), hard-edged Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), and party girl Samantha (Kim Cattrall)--not to mention her own tumultuous love life--gives Carrie plenty of column fodder. Over the course of the first season's 12 episodes, the most prominent dramatic arc concerns Carrie, who goes from turning the tables on \"toxic bachelors\" by having \"sex like a man\" to wanting to join the ranks of \"the monogamists\" with the elusive Mr. Big (Chris Noth). Meanwhile, Miranda, Cynthia, and Samantha have their own dating woes.The second season builds on the foundation of the first season with plot arcs that are both hilarious and heartfelt, taking the show from breakout hit to true pop-culture phenomenon. Relationship epiphanies coexist happily alongside farcical plots and zingy one-liners, resulting in emotionally satisfying episodes that feature the sharp kind of character-defining dialogue that seems to have disappeared from the rest of TV long ago. When last we left the NYC gals, Carrie had just broken up with a commitment-phobic Mr. Big (Chris Noth), but fans of Noth's seductive-yet-distant rake didn't have to wait long until he was back in the picture, as he and Carrie tried to make another go of it. Their relationship evolution, from reunion to second breakup, provides the core of the second season. Among other adventures, Charlotte puzzles over whether one of her beaus was \"gay-straight\" or \"straight-gay\"; Miranda tries to date a guy who insists on having sex only in places where they might get caught; and Samantha copes with dates who range from, um, not big enough tofartoo big--with numerous stops in between.The third season was the charm, as the series earned its first Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series to go along with its Golden Globes for Best Comedy Series and Best Actress (Parker). One of this season's two principal story arcs concerned hapless-in-love Charlotte and her pursuit of a husband; enter (if only...) Kyle McLachlan as the unfortunately impotent Trey. Meanwhile, Carrie has a brief but memorable fling with a politician who's golden, but not in the way she anticipated. She then sabotages her too-good-to-be-true relationship with furniture designer Aidan (John Corbett) by having an affair with Mr. Big (Chris Noth), who himself has gotten married. LikeI Love Lucy, the series benefited from a brief change of scenery with a three-episode jaunt to Los Angeles, where Carrie and company encountered, among others, Matthew McConaughey, Vince Vaughn, Hugh Hefner, and Sarah Michelle Gellar.The fourth season is just as smart and sexy as ever, mixing caustic adult wit and sharply observed situation comedy on the mean streets of Manhattan, though this time the quartet of singleton city girls must endure even tougher combat in the unending war of love, sex, and shopping. Carrie finally seems to have found her ideal life partner when she is reunited with handsome craftsman Aidan. But can their relationship survive trial by cohabitation? Meanwhile Charlotte seems to have both her dream Park Avenue apartment and a solution to her marital problems with Trey. But when the subject of babies comes up, everything starts to unravel for her, too. It's not just Charlotte who has baby issues either: after what seems like an eternity of enforced sexual abstinence Miranda is horrified to discover she's pregnant. And as for the sultry Samantha, she's on a quest for monogamy, first with an exotic lesbian artist, then with a philandering businessman, with whom to her utter dismay she just might have fallen in love.It was a short but sweet fifth season, as HBO's resident comediennes found themselves affected by forces beyond their control--the pregnancies of both Sarah Jessica Parker and Cynthia Nixon. A truncated shooting schedule to accommodate the actresses forced this season to be reduced to a mere eight episodes, but they and creators forged ahead, creating a handful of episodes that if short in content were long on emotion and laughs. Carrie and Miranda wrestled with their solitary lifestyles, albeit with new attachments--Miranda had new baby Brady and single motherhood, while Carrie found herself in the world of publishing as the author of a real-life book of her columns. Charlotte wondered if she'd ever find another man, while Samantha finally got rid of the one that had been vexing her far too much. If the season as a whole felt less than the sum of its parts, those parts were some of the best comedy in the show's history. The season's climactic episode, \"I Love a Charade,\" was one of the series' best episodes ever, equally touching and funny, and grounded the show in an emotional maturity that announced that after all their wild travails, these women had truly grown up.After a long wait--like the entire fifth season--Carrie is dating again. The sixth season starts with Carrie and her sparkly new potential, Berger (Ron Livingston), trying to leave past relationships and hit it off, with mixed results. Meanwhile Carrie's friends seem to be settling down, relatively speaking. Miranda decides that her affair with TiVo cannot compete when Mr. Perfect (Blair Underwood, at his most charming) moves into her building. Charlotte's feelings for her \"opposites attract\" boyfriend (Evan Handler) deepen, but they still have a few things to iron out. Most surprising is Samantha's hot relationship with waiter-actor-stud Smith Jerrod (Jason Lewis) taking on something resembling love, despite Samantha's best intentions. Before the sixth season started in the summer of 2003, a bombshell hit: it was announced that this would be the finale. But it would be a long season, and these 12 episodes plant the seeds for the final 8 airing the following winter. These dozen episodes illustrate the maturity of the show: there's not a bad one in the bunch, and the show is still flat-out funny. The comedy blends serious points of how we perceive singles, couples, and parents (and the gifts we lavish on the latter two). Carrie's method of celebrating her singlehood is just another gem in this treasure of a series.With the last eight episodes of the sixth season, HBO's grand sitcom concluded, leaving untold numbers of women--and many men--feeling deprived. The six-year series certainly did not outlast its welcome; the final season is some of the best TV had to offer in 2004. In many ways, the eight episodes served as a single finale, with all four characters approaching a kind of destiny and happiness, the theme of this last half-season (which aired weeks after the first half). Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) continues her romance with Russian artist (Mikhail Baryshnikov), a flippantly arrogant man who's been around the block, but able to supply Carrie's needed desire for magic. Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) has settled down with Steve (David Eigenberg), but there is more that will change with her, including her address. Charlotte (Kristin Davis) continues to make baby plans now that the husband slot is filled quite nicely (Evan Handler). Going down the final stretch--and Samantha's (Kim Cattrall) cancer--gives the series a more serious tone, but there's always a jab to tickle the funny bone: Miranda's awkwardness with happiness, Charlotte's latest passion, Carrie typing someplace new, and Samantha getting into Paris Hilton territory. Like any series winding down, there is a wedding, a baby, old faces popping up, and some star-ladened new ones. In the final two-part episode, \"An American in Paris,\" Carrie faces her romantic destiny, but also solidifies herself as a fashion icon, an Audrey Hepburn for 21st-century television. In the penultimate episode, she asks her friends an emotional question: \"What if I never met you?\" Certainly fans can ask of themselves the same question and reminisce how much better TV became since they first tuned in these four women of the City.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B006WZIB1C", "B001DDBCUA", "B002ZG98Z0", "B00AIQAS76", "B001DDBCV4", "B002ZG98ZA", "B00B5AAW52", "B002YBUX0K", "0446617687", "B003Z8ZCG6", "B00B1LN8WY", "B004EPZ070", "B0046XG48O", "0316284955", "B00004RFCM", "B00FPUN57K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003Z8ZCG6", "B00004RFCM", "B00382S9UA", "B00382S9SM"]}, "price": 129.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 231120}, "asin": "B000646MNE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QPTYCPH6L._SX300_.jpg", "title": "Sex and the City - The Complete Series: Seasons 1-6"}

{"description": "Director Irwin Winkler weighs in on two commentary tracks, one with Kevin Kline and one with writer Jay Cocks.  Both tracks are thoughtful and filled with details about Cole Porter's life, how the pop singers joined the film, and how their numbers were conceived. As might be expected, a lot of stories are repeated, but they're good stories, such as how \"Be a Clown\" was ripped off forSingin' in the Rain's \"Make 'Em Laugh.\" There's a very good 25-minute making-of featurette, plus a 15-minute music featurette that mixes clips and performances from the film with brief comments by the pop artists performing them (the Broadway re-creations are only mentioned in passing).  Two other featurettes go behind the scenes of two numbers, and the eight deleted scenes include Kevin Kline's short performance of \"You Do Something to Me.\"  Because the musical numbers have the most replay value, it's convenient that they're listed on the scene-selection menu.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000294SIE", "B00023GGHQ", "B0001WTWXS", "B000294QX6", "B0012GMVH6", "B00094ARN2", "0679727922", "B0000047BH", "B006AC9H92", "6305127670", "B004H0M2X2", "B00005B15A", "B00005IA7Y", "B001DE29SS", "B005MYEQ4U", "B000EBD9SA", "B00GPWEPZ8", "6305161879", "B00008G7UF", "B00000DRCN", "B0000ARD7O", "B00003CX8N", "B000PAAK5A", "B008FYZHZ6", "B0088X7Z6S", "0394582357", "B00008NFR4", "B00005YUPC", "B00FZRP8FU", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B000EWBKMG", "B000F7CEC0", "B0007939MK", "B0000C23T2", "B000056HEA", "0739069640", "B00083FZFE", "B00DL48BM6", "B00AMSQBSU", "B0012OX7DA", "B0059XTUB8", "B003UESJH4", "B004YCKJNI", "B004SEUJBE", "B00005NGAE", "B0008ENIKM", "B001KZOVJK", "B000KWZ7JC", "B003GOP0D4", "B001ECDVJU", "B007XTDWKQ", "B00031TXC2", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B00BTYSIV4", "B00D2CYU2W", "0783240171", "B000HT3PGU", "B00G7QPXUI", "B00008L3U6", "B000RPCK2E", "B00E849QSG", "B000055WFW", "B00441GYV0", "B00E1HIWXU", "B00GUO2SKA", "B005S9EJ14", "B00508W3FW", "B00CFHEF48", "B0045HCJ80", "B0017I79BW", "B001DJ7PR8", "B004ZJHSAM", "B0006SGYM4", "B0007QJ1ZW", "B000ND91YU", "B004SIP9VA", "B007P7UF0G", "B005VH4HCE", "B00000G3I2", "B001D8W7EU", "B003WKQ46E", "B0000CE684", "B0036TGT8Y", "B00005JKNF", "B0001FR54I", "B0090XLDKY", "B00HHYF5EI", "B000FC2FX8", "B003O2H7MA", "B0007ZEOPK", "B00GWWV1XU", "B00H83EUQW", "B004G7XCRQ", "B00003CXC9", "B00GHP8SH4", "B00008DDRU", "B000KNFP6G", "6305803765", "B0001CNRBG"], "bought_together": ["B000294SIE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001WTWXS", "B00023GGHQ", "B000294SIE", "B00094ARN2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10160}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.48, "brand": "Generic", "asin": "B00067BBLY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51E8VXPWJML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "De-Lovely: The Cole Porter Story (Special Edition)"}
{"description": "Augustusis equal parts history lesson and soap opera, and thoroughly engaging at all levels. Peter O'Toole plays Octavius/Augustus, heir to his doomed uncle Julius Caesar's command of the far-flung Roman empire. Surviving an assassination attempt and struck by news of the death of his old friend and ally, Agrippa (Ken Duken), in the same day, Octavius waxes nostalgic about his youthful exploits in Caesar's army (Benjamin Sadler plays the young Augustus in flashbacks) and his unprepared immersion in the deadly politics of the Mark Antony (Massimo Ghini) era. More immediate are Octavius' problems trying to stave off conspiracies by his wife Livia (Charlotte Rampling) to set up the emperor's stepson, Tiberius (Michele Bevilacqua), as heir, and talk his dutiful daughter Julia (Vittoria Belvedere) into a marriage she doesn't want. Roger Young (Jesus) directs this highly watchable costume drama, and O'Toole's golden presence makes the ancient intrigues tragically human.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000AJJNLI", "B000A1OFZ0", "B0006OBPZY", "B00007AJF4", "B0002S93TO", "B003EYVXXW", "B00406UK7S", "B0002PYTB4", "B00005R23V", "B004H0M31I", "B000S0KYTE", "B004X1Z14C", "B00005JMH8", "B000VKL6ZM", "B00125WAXM", "B0034G4P58", "B006JY3OHW", "B00000JYWU", "B002NN7ETC", "B009GNI3HY", "B00004U12X", "B007K7IB9I", "B001DZOCY6", "B003VE9WOC", "B004IFYMXO", "B00005JN8Z", "B000A6T1ZE", "B0007XG4ZK", "B000MGB6NM", "B00GJT2OWS", "B000HWZ4AC", "B0007OCG5Q", "B0028RXXE8", "B000AARKOO", "B0009UVCR6", "B00CHMBQM0", "B000034DE2", "B00007G1WH", "B00GMV8GL6", "B000EHQUGC", "B0002VEU4O", "B00005V1WY", "B003A6X166", "B001FZQOOU", "B000BB1520", "0767827775", "B0000524FG", "B000OIOPPE", "B00000JS6F", "B0002YLCG0", "B004P2VQZC", "0783226039", "B0000B1A58", "B003X2P97G", "B000ML8XMO", "B000RF7XYO", "B00078XGP6", "B004XC5LQE", "B004JMSIWM", "B000GIXEIG", "B000GG4Y5A", "B00BYEWLIU", "B002Z2X7GK", "B004FGA2HQ", "0812970586", "B009XTF8NI", "B002AT8KBU", "B00005U8QM", "B001F34HT6", "B002O3Z50Q", "B000R9U3B0", "B000TGCR38", "B0001NBMEE", "1416592814", "B001DWNUCO", "B0023BZ64Y", "B00FFT19XS", "B001F0TT6A", "B004K6FS5W", "B0060MYK7G", "B00ALTQRUC", "B001GH3CL0", "B000056AXZ", "B00008AOTO", "B0041KT3P8", "B000LSAIYE", "B00007G1YP", "B0086IMN80", "B0009WFFHM", "B003WEAVZU", "B0002B15YM", "B00015HXEA", "B004FHCH8C", "B002DY9KQ6", "B004H4AD2U", "B00BTYJYR6", "B001NSLE5I", "B002DU39GW"], "bought_together": ["B000AJJNLI", "B0006OBPZY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000AJJNLI", "B0006OBPZY", "B00406UK7S", "B000S0KYTE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 158254}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 17.49, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0006D3HDI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R4GXFJZML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Augustus"}

{"description": "\"The love impulse in man,\" says a psychiatrist inBringing Up Baby, \"frequently reveals itself in terms of conflict.\" That's for sure. For a primer on the rules and regulations of the classic screwball comedy, which throws love and conflict into close proximity, look no further. A straight-laced paleontologist (Cary Grant) loses a dinosaur bone to a dog belonging to free-spirited heiress Katharine Hepburn. In trying to retrieve said bone, Grant is drawn into the vortex surrounding the delicious Hepburn, which becomes a flirtatious pas de deux that will transform both of them. Director Howard Hawks plays the complications as a breathless escalation of their \"love impulse,\" yet the movie is nonetheless romantic for all its speed. (Hawks'sHis Girl Friday, also with Grant, goes even faster.) Grant and Hepburn are a match made in movie heaven, in sync with each other throughout. Not a great box-office success when first released,Bringing Up Babyhas since taken its place as a high-water mark of the screwball form, and it was used as a model for Peter Bogdanovich'sWhat's Up, Doc?Re-creating the role she originated in Philip Barry's wickedly witty Broadway play, Katharine Hepburn stars as the spoiled and snobby socialite Tracy Lord inThe Philadelphia Story, one of the great romantic comedies from the golden age of MGM studios. Applying her impossibly high ideals to everyone but herself, Tracy is about to marry a stuffy executive when her congenial ex-husband (Cary Grant), arrives to protect his former father-in-law from a potentially scandalous tabloid expos&#xE9;. In an Oscar-winning role, James Stewart is the scandal reporter who falls for Tracy as her wedding day arrives, throwing her into a dizzying state of premarital jitters. Who will join Tracy at the altar? Snappy dialogue flows like sparkling wine under the sophisticated direction of George Cukor in this film that turned the tide of Hepburn's career from \"box-office poison\" to glamorous Hollywood star.MGM originally promotedDinner at Eightby touting the \"all-star cast,\" but this is no run-of-the-mill omnibus picture. On the contrary, rather than cramming as many big names as possible into a lumbering vehicle, the movie's impeccably crafted script (by Edna Ferber and Herman J. Mankiewicz) and direction (by George Cukor) gave some immortal screen luminaries a chance to shine. For sheer bravery, John Barrymore's achingly poignant performance as Larry Renault, a washed-up matinee idol who has \"outlived everything but his vanity,\" is unmatched. Barrymore's brother, Lionel, is equally touching as shipping magnate Oliver Jordan. Oliver vainly tries to save his family's century-old firm, at the same time hiding his financial and health troubles from his wife, Millicent, played to hysterical perfection by Billie Burke. The Great Depression is presented in microcosm as Millicent frets about throwing the ultimate society dinner, oblivious to the world tumbling down around her. She is forced to invite to her precious party such undesirables as crass financier Dan Packard (\"HesmellsOklahoma!\"). Even worse in Millicent's eyes than Packard (Wallace Beery, doing an impressive steamroller imitation) is his social-climbing wife, Kitty (Jean Harlow, never funnier). Be sure to watch for Harlow's brief encounter with Marie Dressler, who brings an extraordinary winking wisdom to the role of aging star Carlotta Vance. As the two enter the dining room in the film's final scene, Harlow makes an offhand remark that elicits from Dressler one of the great screen double takes of all time. Like so much ofDinner at Eight, the moment is priceless.Newspaper comedy doesn't seem like an MGM genre--ink-stained wretches don't go with Adrian gowns and white deco furniture--but Jack Conway, the designated bull in the Metro china shop (Boom Town,Too Hot to Handle) does what he can to bring some dash and flair toLibeled Lady's wildly complicated script. Spencer Tracy is the tough city editor who goes to some spectacular extremes when socialite Myrna Loy files a $5 million libel suit against his paper for calling her a notorious home-wrecker; he hires celebrated ladies' man William Powell to seduce Loy and asks his long-suffering fianc&#xE9;e, Jean Harlow, to marry Powell temporarily so she can play the wronged wife when Loy and Powell are discovered together. The couples crisscross, with frenetic and not entirely unpredictable results, but much of the pleasure here lies in seeing these iconic stars being so thoroughly themselves. The dialogue strains for champagne wit, but the movie's most memorable moment is pure, rotgut slapstick--Powell's bout with an unruly fly-fishing rod.This one's all about the ladies. InStage Door, an absolutely terrific 1937 gem, a Manhattan boardinghouse for aspiring actresses houses an amazing roster of golden-era performers--some of whom, like their characters, were just breaking in. It's hard to say who's in best form here: Katharine Hepburn in blueblood mode, Ginger Rogers streetwise, Andrea Leeds suffering, Lucille Ball and Ann Miller impossibly young, and Eve Arden being, well, splendidly Eve Ardenish. The sassy comedy and sober life lessons are wonderfully mixed by the underrated director Gregory La Cava (My Man Godfrey), who captures the brashness of '30s female chatter in a much pleasanter way than the more famousThe Women. Hepburn's sublime attempts to wrestle with the line about calla lilies being in bloom will make you smile long after the movie's over.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009S4IJM", "B000ION7A8", "B000E6ESWG", "B006TTC5JK", "B000GRUQL0", "B008D1Q1VU", "B000N3T0GY", "B0006Z2KYI", "B000ION7AI", "B000E8JO32", "B0024FAG7Q", "B003ZKBELG", "B001D8W7EA", "B000GRUQLK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004GJYR7I", "B001KXZGNW", "B0045HCJQW", "B008D1Q1VU"]}, "price": 7.48, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 176809}, "asin": "B0006Z2KXY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516HqvPiwPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Classic Comedies Collection (Bringing Up Baby / The Philadelphia Story Two-Disc Special Edition / Dinner at Eight / Libeled Lady / Stage Door / To Be or Not to Be)"}

{"description": "The premiere season of Michael Landon'sHighway to Heavenis consolidated into this collector&#x92;s edition box set of seven discs containing 24 episodes of faith and love. The television series (1984-1989) has a loyal following because of its compelling storylines and uplifting messages characteristic of Landon, an icon of family-friendly entertainment since the early days ofLittle House on the PrairieandBonanza. An angel on assignment from God is disguised as \"everyman\" Jonathan Smith in order to comfort--and sometimes miraculously guide--the lost and suffering through various dilemmas. Smith and his earthly cohort, ex-cop Mark Gordon (Victor French), journey across country to work as horse trainers, bellhops, baby-sitters--whatever the task requires. The collection leads with the two-part pilot episode that establishes Smith and Gordon's friendship.

{"description": "Franco Zeffirelli was and is clearly in love with Maria Callas, but unlike the average Callas fan, as a movie director, he was able to do something about it. This superbly made film, about the last few months of the great soprano's life in 1977, moves easily between fact and fantasy to express that love and to give her a more upbeat ending than the one that fate actually dealt her. It is made with the attention to small details that is a hallmark of Zeffirelli's work.In reality, Callas became a recluse in her luxurious Paris apartment, mourning the loss of her voice, the breakup of her relationship to Aristotle Onassis and the disintegration of her career. Her final days were a nightmare. But Zeffirelli uses his imagination to rewrite  that unhappy ending. He invents a rock producer, Tom Kelly (Jeremy Irons) who clearly is a Zeffirelli figure (the names rhyme). Kelly used to be her manager and has a scheme to revive her career in movies: he will film her greatest roles, using her recordings as soundtracks; she will go through the motions and lip-synch the words. It might have worked; experiments withCarmen, which she recorded but never sang onstage, were certainly promising. But Callas turned down the plan, on grounds of artistic integrity.But in fact, Zeffirelli does make it work in this movie. Fanny Ardant does a marvelous job as Callas,  not only shaping the words of her various arias (digitized and sounding better than ever) but also using facial expressions that speak as eloquently as words. Here is Callas reborn, with all her temperament, anguish and pride. Raw emotions are unleashed, particularly in a production ofTosca,when she stabs the villainous Scarpia (Justino Diaz) shouting savagely \"muori dannato, muori, muori, muori\" (\"die , damn you, die, die die\") She is avenging all the insults and disappointments of her life; Ardant becomes Callas in such moments.--Joe McLellan", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000S84NMA", "B00006BSGZ", "B000641D42", "B0030T120A", "B0007ORE1C", "B000N0W9JW", "B000DZ95PI", "B00005LIN2", "B0000W5JAY", "6305614385", "B005MTHRAA", "B000002RT6", "B00031TXC2", "B000AL72R8", "B00000K3TN", "0671255835", "B004P0IRHE", "B00AQBDU4Q", "B001451HWA", "B00009YXEN", "B00579EKW8", "B0000UJLF0", "B00AZMFO6I", "B0001US61O", "3829603142", "B001IQDAMK", "0312429967", "B00003CXBH", "157467059X", "0394563670", "B0009S2K8S", "0684859858", "6305614377", "1555531792", "B00006C2CD", "093134090X", "B000069V7N", "B000002AVU", "B000FIGXGM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000S84NMA", "B000TSE7XE", "6305614385", "B000641D42"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 182041}, "asin": "B00092ZKZ4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AJ2Z3NN2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Callas Forever"}
{"description": "Au hazard Balthazarcan have a profoundly moving effect on those who are sensitive to its power. Like any film by Robert Bresson, it provokes widely different responses: Many critics have hailed it as a masterpiece, while others (as Pauline Kael observed) \"may find it painstakingly tedious and offensively holy.\" It all depends on what the viewer brings to Bresson's seemingly simple tale of a donkey named Balthazar, who experiences kindness and cruelty as he is passed from owner to owner. Populated by a variety of sinners and saints alike, the film can be seen as a simple animal fable, as Balthazar suffers nobly at the hands of his handlers. Dig deeper into Bresson's art, however, and you're likely to find a very Catholic story with strong parallels to the life of Christ and his unbearable burden of the sins of mankind.No matter how you approach the film, only the most cold-hearted viewer will be immune to Balthazar's fate. And if you're not sure what to make of it all, this superb Criterion DVD offers two essential bonus features to guide you toward a greater understanding of Bresson's approach to cinema: Film scholar and devoted \"Bressonian\" Donald Richie offers his astute observations in a 2004 video interview, and in an in-depth French TV appearance from 1966, Bresson talks at length aboutAu hazard Balthazaralong with fellow directors Louis Malle and Jean-Luc Godard, and members of the film's cast and crew. This is a remarkable document from a bygone era, when \"art film\" was at its peak, and directors (especially French ones) were eager to discuss the intellectual significance of their work. Kudos to Criterion for including this archival gem of film appreciation.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BB14IA", "B000K0YLX2", "B00AQ6J6H6", "B001LMU19G", "0780022343", "B000087EY6", "6305257450", "6305744114", "B008DL4K8Q", "B00005M2C7", "B005152C7S", "B000127IF2", "B00AQ6J3AG", "B000C8Q900", "B00005JLV7", "B00EO2I6W4", "B009VO9XSG", "B001TIQT7A", "B00HE011DE", "B0007989Y8", "B000I8OOG0", "B0007OC6ZG", "B00005BHW6", "B001UF5KOU", "B0000A02TX", "B001TIQT6G", "B00GA9F2PI", "B00CUKTHJ8", "B009RWRIMA", "B0016AKSOG", "B000BB14I0", "B000N2HBIO", "B006X96PBU", "B00005UQ7T", "B000093NR0", "B00HVOFP6W", "B00005EBSF", "B00009ME9Z", "B005HK13S6", "B000BR6QIW", "B00BX49B0C", "B000AQKUG8", "B00180R06I", "B00KE3B6NI", "B001BEK8C4", "B004WPYO7E", "B00DHN8GQ2", "B00KE3B6LA", "B001LMU1C8", "B000E5LEV0", "B005152CC8", "6305131104", "B0001GH5RY", "B001ILTUKG", "B0016B6ZEC", "B002BWP4A6", "B001298BPY", "B000C8Q8ZQ", "B002U6DVQ2", "B007A9EGB8", "B00005NC66", "B004NWPY20", "B00000F7E6", "B001BEK8CE", "B00GBT629C", "B00DZP1C3Q", "B000PKG6O4", "B00A8QDHYW", "6305081034", "B002AFX53C", "B001LMU1B4", "B00HVOFP08", "B00004Z1FM", "B000EOTWIS", "B005HK13OK", "B00DZP1BUU", "B0035G5IOE", "B000M2E3GS", "B004CGUC10", "B00005QAPH", "B00005QAPJ", "B007A9EGC2", "B001WLMOL4", "B000IHYXH6", "B0000633SD", "B000HKH0WY", "B000FUF7CQ", "B000XQ4HQO", "B00JGR3M26", "B004NWPY34", "B00L3ZB7PS", "B00023P4N8", "B008CJ0JS4", "B00003CXUM", "B00GG0NABE", "B0007989ZC", "B001IZNIV4", "B005VU9LP4", "B000093NQY", "0292776241"], "bought_together": ["B000BB14IA", "B000K0YLX2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001EOQCJE", "6305428239", "B001QOGYBI", "B0000640VJ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 88549}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 20.17, "brand": "WIAZEMSKY,ANNE", "asin": "B00092ZLEY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41MLI-OZspL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Au Hasard Balthazar (The Criterion Collection)"}
{"description": "Will Smith's easygoing charm makesHitchthe kind of pleasant, uplifting romantic comedy that you could recommend to almost anyone--especially if there's romance in the air. As suave Manhattan dating consultant Alex \"Hitch\" Hitchens, Smith plays up the smoother, sophisticated side of his established screen persona as he mentors a pudgy accountant (Kevin James) on the lessons of love. The joke, of course, is that Hitch's own love life is a mess, and as he coaches James toward romance with a rich, powerful, and seemingly inaccessible beauty named Allegra (Amber Valetta), he's trying too hard to impress a savvy gossip columnist (Eva Mendes) with whom he's fallen in love. Through mistaken identities and mismatched couples, director Andy Tennant brings the same light touch that made Drew Barrymore'sEver Afterso effortlessly engaging. As romantic comedies go,Hitchdoesn't offer any big surprises, but as a date movie it gets the job done with amiable ease and style.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009RCPUW", "B001QERPAC", "B0013J55B6", "B000N6U0E2", "B0001Z3TXE", "B00005JN0T", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AEFY99O", "B003Y5H4ZW", "B000VXWX7E", "B002K0WBXW", "B000803BQC", "B000BKVQS4", "B000HT386M", "B003Y5H574", "0800141741", "6305428115", "B00007E2F5", "B00005JMW7", "B00AEBB9WI", "B00008G8M4", "B002VECM6S", "B000LC3ICE", "B000ELJAEM", "B00003CXSM", "B004EPZ0BG", "B00AEBB8NS", "076780421X", "B00164KYV4", "B00AEFY0F2", "B003Y5H524", "B000VG66XS", "B00008WJD6", "B00AEFXWXI", "B002ZG998G", "B002ZG989G", "B000YDBPAM", "B000CEV3KU", "B00005JPE3", "B000AP04FG", "B00005JLQN", "B001C5LLQ4", "B00003CXO1", "B002P413IC", "B0001AVZA8", "B0012KJ0DK", "B0015I2RT8", "B000E6EHE0", "B001NPD9RM", "B00008VFCA", "B00006ZXSL", "B000FGGWGK", "B000098XQ8", "B001OQCUZM", "B000MQC9H4", "B00005JN3W", "B00005IBN0", "B003BV8ICC", "B00006FMUW", "B001SN78JO", "B000RBA6C4", "B0009UZGIM", "B001GKJ2E8", "B00005JNTU", "B000ZBEOEC", "B00AEFY4CG", "B0000B1OFL", "B008RNYMG0", "B0038N9WKU", "B0021L8UYY", "B000683VI4", "6304765266", "B000TZJBPQ", "B00005JLSB", "B0007PLLBU", "B000059TG6", "B002ZG9968", "B003EYVXXC", "B0000897EG", "B00005JM4Q", "B004IK30MI", "B00081U7HC", "B002ZG97B0", "B000P0J0EW", "B00005O5CM", "B005F2JRUC", "B000ASDFGI", "B00005JKCH", "B0006GAI5U", "B0000AKCKI", "B001UV4XRY", "B00005JMQW", "B0010X5X4O", "B000M341QE", "B001AKTZW8", "B00024JC4E", "B00AEBB8R4", "B00005JKMQ", "B00CLSBNNM", "B005LAII2Q"], "bought_together": ["B000N6U0E2", "B001QERPAC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000N6U0E2", "B002ZG97TW", "B002VECM6S", "B000AP04FG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 105544}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.94, "brand": "SMITH,WILL", "asin": "B000957O7S", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41jGu0AHCAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hitch (Fullscreen Edition)"}

{"description": "The axe of cancellation dangled perilously overArrested Developmentduring its second season, but the award-winning comedy fought against fate to deliver a hilarious if scattershot 18 episodes (reduced from the original show order of 22), and stayed alive for the  beginning of a third season. Most likely, the creators and actors knew the clock was ticking down, so they didn't hesitate to throw their all into these manic, hilarious episodes, which have only the thinnest of plot arcs but an electrifying energy that makes them hard to resist. Some of the story antics were more of the same: good son Michael (Jason Bateman) tries to keep his company afloat, but is often foiled by older brother Gob (Will Arnett); the precarious marriage of Lindsay (Portia de Rossi) and Tobias (David Cross) undergoes a trial separation; and young George-Michael (Michael Cera) fights his attraction to his cousin Maeby (Alia Shawkat). Other show developments, though, were new and stunningly, uproariously bizarre: Buster (Tony Hale) joins the army, but later finds his hand bitten off by a seal (yes, a real seal), and Oscar (Jeffrey Tambor), the hippie brother of jailed George Sr. (also Tambor), rekindles an affair with sister-in-law Lucille (Jessica Walter), which may have resulted in Buster's conception years ago.Jokes flew fast and furious, as did guest stars--Ben Stiller, Julia Louis-Dreyfuss, Christine Taylor, Thomas Jane, Ed Begley Jr., Ione Skye, and Zach Braff among them--making it hard to keep straight who was doing what and why. No matter, as each of the episodes was in and of itself was a perfect gem of comedy, strung together by sharp writing and fantastic performances. In addition to the regular cast, both Liza Minnelli, reprising her role as \"Lucille Two,\" and Martin Short, as an, um, eccentric family friend, deserve special mention, with the episode both appeared in, \"Ready, Aim, Marry Me,\" a frenetic exercise in slapstick farce. Typical examples of the show's offbeat humor were found in \"Afternoon Delight,\" in which various members of the Bluth family discover the true meaning of the '70s ballad, \"Meet the Veals,\" wherein the Bluths encounter the conservative parents of George Michael's girlfriend, and \"Motherboy XXX,\" surrounding an unsettling mother-son traditional dance. The entire cast cohered perfectly through this season, and their give and take provided a perfect balance among the actors, all of whom were even better than the previous year. However, it's Bateman who should be singled out as the show's anchor, mixing dry sarcasm with impeccable comic timing. Despite plummeting ratings,Arrested Developmentdidn't just keep its head above water, it swam with grace and hilarity.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EXDS7K", "B0002PYS7Y", "B000RBA6CO", "B00ICR6SBI", "B000RW3VDE", "B001B9LWME", "B002DPPH6W", "B0024FAD9M", "B0018RKEQE", "B002N5N5KW", "B003L77GE2", "B0002W4P98", "B001L1S1PS", "B0053O8ACS", "B002N5N5NE", "B009LDD40U", "B000SINT4S", "B000AJJNI6", "B002N5N5SO", "B000GPIPTM", "B0024FAD9W", "B00005JNEQ", "B0009VBTP0", "B000FFJYE8", "B002N5N5PM", "B001VPJYZ0", "B0058JEHTS", "B003L77GJM", "B001DPHDBU", "B003R4ZMOA", "B003L77GDS", "B000U1ZV1W", "B001DJLCRC", "B003UD7JDA", "B003L77GBU", "B000EBGFPY", "B000GETTKM", "B001AEF6AY", "B000NOKFH6", "B008L0YMZA", "B000WZEZGI", "B000TGURZ8", "B0058JEHSO", "B007QU37LG", "B00BT1XCOU", "B00005JNOG", "B000083C6V", "B000NNK4DM", "B001RTSPVY", "B00166UFSY", "B009LDCVJU", "B003DZX46G", "B0032UYFA6", "B0012CJQY6", "B0033WH6MW", "B00443FN1A", "B00005ALS0", "B000Q6GUKW", "B00AB65SVE", "B000BNI90Y", "B00008PHCU", "B007CO5MVE", "B003L77GTC", "B005OZIV20", "B001YYQA0K", "B002EOVX9W", "B0014WAAE4", "B002LITRJ4", "B002AMVED8", "B002JVWQSW", "B0007PALZ2", "B0058YPG1G", "B000G6BL88", "B000HT3P6U", "B007KFZ7UQ", "B000XA5K48", "B004SUDPXW", "B0001I9Y8U", "B003ES5JH4", "B009LDD4BO", "B001NOMOS8", "B0053O8A78", "B0000797E5", "B00008YGRS", "B007C8RZL0", "B0000E2PVR", "B0012EBVAG", "B001OQCVFG", "B00120LPP6", "B002N5N5LG", "B00123BY6S", "B0060MYKYY", "B00475B0G2", "B004P9UWM8", "B00EEDNR9A", "B00009KNU5", "B003L77G06", "B000P12LWY", "B002OOWKSU", "B007C8RZQ0"], "bought_together": ["B000EXDS7K", "B0002PYS7Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002PYS7Y", "B000EXDS7K", "B00EPH8S58", "B0009VBTP0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17018}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 12.96, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B000A9QKRI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51iIxr%2BTyvL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Arrested Development: Season 2"}

{"description": "The quiet little mountain town of South Park, Colorado enters its sixth season as America&#x92;s weirdest and most dysfunctional town, and if you thought that title was already claimed by Springfield, I have one word for you: Lemmiwinks. If you thought it couldn&#x92;t get any weirder, this season will prove you wrong. But the good news is thatSouth Parkhas always been able to maintain a mathematical-like balance of proportionality so impressive it could be charted on a graph: asSouth Parkgets weirder, so it gets funnier (usually). Which makes sense because one ofSouth Park&#x92;s greatest strengths has always been to reflect the strangest elements of society, which, let&#x92;s face it, are pretty strange. Targets this season include exploitive daytime TV shows (\"Freak Strike\"), celebrities gone wild (Russell Crowe fightin&#x92; round the world), the Catholic priest sexual-abuse scandals (\"Red Hot Catholic Love\"), and the meat industry (\"Fun With Veal\"). Creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker even parody the reality of competing withThe Simpsons&#x92;s longevity in \"The Simpsons Already Did It,\" where Butters, gone out of his mind and in his Professor Chaos persona, can&#x92;t even come up with an original evil scheme to unleash on the citizens of South Park. Fortunately for fans, the quality of the writing is as strong this season as it has been at any point in the show&#x92;s run, and it&#x92;s not like the show&#x92;s going to back off from its trademark gross-out factor at this point. Proof of that can be found in \"The Death Camp of Tolerance.\" In an extreme satire of sex education class, Mr. Slave and Lemmiwinks, the heroic and intensely unfortunate gerbil, make their, umm, debuts. In South Park, this is what qualifies as a normal school day. Taken as a whole, Season Six is one of the show's strongest punches yet to the face of a society that had it coming.--Daniel Vancini", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006Z2L2Y", "B000CNESM6", "B000FSME2Y", "B0001ZWLVU", "B000KLQUMQ", "B0000CABL2", "B000R7I3XC", "B00023P49M", "B0018O5WUU", "B00023P49C", "B001O0TWXG", "B0030Y11UG", "B004MLEYTG", "B006W93ELK", "B009SQ9Q5M", "B0030Y11NS", "B001O0TWXQ", "B000ZT0S9O", "B000USUA8E", "B004MLEYT6", "B006W93EM4", "B000022TSW", "B00105308I", "B00AEBB8TM", "B009SQ9Y7M", "B000LW7OKQ", "B003VJTGKW", "B003DZX46G", "6305301700", "B000RO6JZO", "B000HT3P6U", "B00G4RCF60", "B000E6ES9O", "B0012018OE", "B000AQ68Z0", "B001VFM0ZG", "B00K8HAJN8", "B001CQONKO", "B006IOAHTQ", "B00FR81Z40", "B00LFW6BA0", "B00E0FW054", "B0053O8A32", "B008412UQ4", "B000NNK4DM", "B00008YGRV", "0762435704", "030789682X", "B00CJEK6KY", "B00G4RCB14", "B0006HBZEW", "B000UAE7UE", "B00AEFZ8OY", "B000FEBWTE", "B003L77G9W", "B000B5XOWU", "B00CJEKA2I", "B0013LRKUI", "0762435615", "B000083C6V", "B006CR2OD6", "B003V3FVQ6", "B007KFZ88M", "B00CJEK7GW", "B00008YGRS", "B000A6T27G", "B000RZIGX6", "B008412UKA", "B00363WGB4", "B007KFZ7YM", "B00BYNL8DU", "B000RPD0DC", "B0012KSUTA", "B00J5LXPPM", "B007KFZ8AA", "B00BTRKMNI", "B0058YPMHO", "B00F77MAO0", "B007KFZ7PG", "B000E0OE3K", "0783230338", "B004696M94", "B00000J8BV", "B008AITJ7O", "B00GSSD73K", "B001MT7ZI8", "B008FRJDVC", "B000F9T700", "B007KFZ8B4", "B00K7IPGS6", "B009WSJHD2", "B00F4NPBI4", "B006IOAHPK", "B007KFZ7UQ", "B001RIZ7OI", "B00330WP6Q"], "bought_together": ["B0006Z2L2Y", "B0001ZWLVU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000CABL2", "B0001ZWLVU", "B00023P49C", "B00023P49M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10680}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 16.99, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B000ADWCYY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WktY4zzdL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "South Park: Season 6"}
{"description": "The question facing any viewer of the Japanese CG featureFinal Fantasy VII: Advent Childrenis: do you have to know the games on which it&#x92;s based in order to understand the film? And the answer is: it certainly helps. But even complete novices (i.e., most parents) in theFinal Fantasyworld will find some entertainment in its wealth of fantasy-based action, and the animation never fails to astonish. Picking up two years after an epic battle between the forces of good (represented by brooding soldier Cloud) and evil (Cloud&#x92;s former general, Sephiroth),FFVIIopens in the devastated city of Midgard, whose youthful occupants suffer from a ghastly disease known as Geostigma. A trio of brothers arrives with what appears to be a cure for the plague, but their gesture conceals a more sinister purpose: to revive Sephiroth and bring about the end of the world. Cloud and his companions must once again rise to the occasion to stop the siblings and the revived Sephiroth from unleashing total destruction. Complex and self-referential to the point of occasional incomprehension,Final Fantasy VIIwill definitely be most appreciated by fans of the game series, but if others can look past the numbing dialogue and frenetic action (which is a bit too intense for very young children), the film offers a carefree and action-packed viewing experience. The two-disc set contains the original Japanese language version of the film as well as an English-dubbed edition (Rachel Leigh Cook and Christy Carlson Romano, among others, provide the vocal talent) and a version edited for the Venice Film Festival. A 30-minute featurette that recaps theFinal Fantasystory up toVII, as well as a making-of documentary, deleted scenes, and promotions for futureFinal Fantasy VIIgames and products round out the extras.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CY5D", "B000FDOTIQ", "B0007OY31G", "B00000JRSB", "B0014X7SQ6", "B008H6GHL0", "B001I9XOQO", "B0010358CQ", "B000QXDFQM", "B00005V1XW", "B00005TNI6", "B001TD6SN0", "B000XYBIKO", "B009AVC922", "B000LOAQNQ", "B001JTADR6", "074401543X", "1566867142", "B0000296O5", "B00ENNBZ68", "B00008URUA", "B001CMIUYS", "B002I0GXWO", "B008H6GH8I", "0744010241", "B00005LOXE", "0804162867", "B003IFVKM6", "6304493681", "B000KF0P1Y", "B000FQ2DTA", "B00002R28C", "B000FS2VZO", "B00008RUYZ", "B004JPJHMY", "B002U6CJO2", "B0009A4EVM", "B000AO8CH4", "B0012Z5UM0", "B0047WMHGC", "B0001O3YA8", "B00003CXBK", "B005H0OEJ6", "B000GABOTU", "B004DMIISM", "162692032X", "B00005NG6U", "B00AO075UY", "B000Y53HH4", "B005NQ5LLE", "B00EZ227X2", "B001GXI4LM", "B002I0GZ5Y", "B004L6Y0T6", "B001G3B0HC", "B00005V4XG", "B00KN16YHO", "B001OQCVI8", "0767802454", "B002MIK0TE", "B000R37S00", "B00BY0G0YU", "B00009WAUH", "0307468372", "B005I65NBW", "B00GHJX8W0", "B008SBZD5U", "B000F6ZIFQ", "0316401196", "B001C4ZQEI", "B000CDGVOO", "B002FVPFUC", "B00004TC6E", "B004COLCK2", "B00005JNJV", "B000NDRNMM", "B00GOT13BQ", "B00004Y57G", "B0045U4U52", "B001TD6SK8", "B0002A2S26", "B002S4DOA4", "B0036BDQ88", "B0013FID78", "B007NU542O", "B000NPTOTK", "B0071LEH14", "1421500493", "B0010YOQIW", "B002O3Z50Q", "B003F3NEAC", "B00829H3E2", "B000BKSJ52", "B00356GVRW", "0744000416", "B000CDGVOE"], "bought_together": ["B00003CY5D", "B0007OY31G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00C3MKCF6", "B0029XFQF0", "B004LWZW4M", "B004DMIIVO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 25738}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.64, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000AMJG4Y", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J3SJW6H0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Final Fantasy VII - Advent Children (Two-Disc Special Edition)"}
{"description": "Despite the near-certainty of cancellation, ratings in the cellar and nothing left to lose, the fourth and final season ofStar Trek: Enterprisewas unanimously hailed as the best. After endingseason 3with a mind-boggling cliffhanger, series creators Rick Berman and Brannon Braga handed show-runner duties to executive producer Manny Coto, who rejuvenated the flagging franchise by bridging the gap betweenEnterpriseand the future developments ofStar Trek: The Original Series. By recruiting lifelongTrekexperts Mike Sussman and the husband-and-wife team of Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens to his writing staff, Coto ensured that political events in theEnterprisetimeline would lead to a \"coalition of planets,\" thus forming the Federation cornerstone ofStar Trek's future. But first, Coto had to find a way to extract Capt. Archer (Scott Bakula) and his battle-worn crew from an alternate timeline--the result of the continuing Temporal Cold War--in which the Nazis have invaded U.S. soil in 1944. In the normalEnterprisetimeline, political upheavals have left relations between Vulcans, Andorians, Tellarites, and Humans in a state of near-disastrous chaos.Into this blazing cauldron of action-adventure, Coto and staff introduced story arcs that connected toStar Trek's future, including a three-episode arc (\"Borderland,\" \"Cold Station 12,\" and \"The Augments\") in which Dr. Arik Soong (played byNext Generationalumnus Brent Spiner) and his superhuman \"Augments\" chart a tragic course that would lead, in future generations, to the creation of Spiner's cyberneticNextGencharacter, Data. \"The Forge,\" \"Awakening,\" and \"Kir'Shara\" returned T'Pol (Jolene Blalock) to her native Vulcan, where encounters with the legendary philosopher Surak, and zealous sect called the Syrannites, lead to pivotal history with the Vulcan High Command. In subsequent episodes, Phlox (John Billingsley) would discover the reason why some Klingons lack \"cranial ridges\" (thus solving a vexingStar Trekmystery), and \"In a Mirror, Darkly\" marked and eventful return to the \"Mirror Universe\" from the original series episode \"Mirror, Mirror,\" for what Coto aptly describes (in the bonus featurette) as a two-part \"romp,\" complete with a \"Mirror Universe\" title sequence, the reappearance of theU.S.S. Defiantfrom the original series episode \"The Tholian Web,\" and a glorious recreation of a \"Constitution Class\" starship bridge that gave long-time Trekkies a breathtaking rush of nostalgia.In the closing episodes, the formation of the Federation is threatened by a radical xenophobe (Peter Weller) whose isolationist tactics lead Trip (Connor Trinneer) and T'Pol to a future of interspecies parenthood, and while the series-ending \"These Are The Voyages...\" is considered a disappointment by some, it provided a suitableNext Generationtribute toStar Trek's past, present, and future. Considering the daunting challenge of tying up loose ends while looking forward in a way that demanding fans could appreciate, it's fair to say thatEnterprisereached a satisfying conclusion that its cast and crew can be proud of.DVD featuresIt's only fitting that Season 4's bonus features have a bittersweet quality, celebrating theStar Trekfranchise while acknowledging its uncertain future. For the first time on anyStar Trekseries, closure was imposed prematurely, and \"That's a Wrap\" (a video from theEnterprisewrap party at the Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood) has the privileged feel of an emotional family reunion. (Unfortunately, Jolene Blalock and Connor Trinneer were unable to attend.) \"Inside the 'Mirror' Episodes\" offers a closer look at those enjoyably nostalgic episodes (\"we put the 'Ho' back in Hoshi\" jokes Mike Sussman about Linda Park's \"empress\" persona), and in \"Links to the Legacy,\" Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens explain how they broughtEnterprisecloser to its originalStar Trekheritage. \"Visual Effects Magic\" charts the astonishing advancements in digital effects since the comparatively crude effects ofNext Generation, and \"Enterprise Secrets\" reveals an affectionate assembly of behind-the-scenes personnel on the final day of shooting.  There's one final Easter egg (NX-01 File #10) about the ultimately futile \"SaveEnterprise\" fan protest against series cancellation (with appreciative comments by Scott Bakula and Connor Trinneer), and as always, the informative audio and text commentaries are fan-essential features loaded with detailed trivia and anecdotal history.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000A6CLL0", "B0009I7NGW", "B0007TKH66", "B00062IDCO", "B00062IDLA", "B0002WZTCA", "B0002JP4GE", "B00008KA57", "B000228EBS", "B0001NBNFW", "B00008KA59", "B00008KA5A", "B00005JLF5", "B00008972H", "B00008KGT0", "B00008KA58", "B000127LW2", "B00BHWG0CM", "B00BHWG0DQ", "B000063V8T", "B000063V8S", "B00062RCC6", "B00062IDDS", "B000063V8R", "B00005Y1NF", "B001DHXT3Y", "B000062XFG", "B000VDDDY6", "B0017VG69U", "B000RZIGVS", "B000HEWEJ4", "B0048FUUAI", "B00005JM3A", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B00K2CHUPY", "B0019N95IK", "B00IWTVDUW", "B00HT851LO", "B0011FLGZQ", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00BHWG1AI", "B007USBGSA", "B001DHXT6G", "B00K2CHWYI", "B004TJ1H3C", "B00BHWG0G8", "B000CQM4YM", "B004HYW84G", "B00HUPC5X8", "B00CYQXHLC", "B0007UDCX0", "B000HT3Q2I", "B00GTZWZH6", "1476706743", "B002EL4RLQ", "B00HCK7THS", "B000BNI90Y", "B000CCBCIA", "B00GX7D5G0", "B004EXWGHY", "B0017MO10U", "B001DW2BG0", "B00HNTOVX8", "B007USE5CE", "B000BR9SA0", "B003H9LIRK", "B0002NY81C", "B00BD6K54G", "B002I9Z8GM", "B003L77GUG", "B00402FGE4", "B00BUDDMGU", "B007XF0XVQ", "B005X4P3DC", "B003ZFC9M4", "B001RHGRTS", "B00061QJSK", "B000WTZ6SK", "B00F3L8P26", "B00CTSDDVO", "B000AJJNFE", "B0010YSD7M", "B00E3QJ7JC", "B002GP7ZVO", "B002VA5A02", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B0009JE6G6", "B005PPMHWE", "B002I9Z89Y", "B00466H3A4", "B0006FO9B0", "B00000ILBK", "B00GHH9HQ8", "B00DYQ1GBE", "B0000658PQ", "B002VA59ZS", "B004LWZW6K", "B0042YZFYG", "B00FFEM0W2", "B000F8O2PQ"], "bought_together": ["B000A6CLL0", "B0009I7NGW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000063V8U", "B000A6CLL0", "B0009I7NGW", "B0007TKH66"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22610}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 40.79, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B000AOEMXC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FZA50YDNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek Enterprise - The Complete Fourth Season"}

{"description": "Perennially one of the WB's highest-rated series,Gilmore Girlshit its creative high point to date with its stellar fifth season, which started out with young Rory (Alexis Bledel) feeling the fallout of doing something terribly non-Rory-like: sleeping with Dean (Jared Padalecki), her married ex-boyfriend. Rory's indulgence in adultery put, for the first time, a serious, sharp wedge in her relationship with her mother, Lorelai (Lauren Graham), who was both shocked by her daughter's behavior and worried Rory would repeat the mistakes Lorelai made at her age. But while Rory jetted off to Europe with her grandmother (Kelly Bishop) for the summer, Lorelai finally got her relationship with diner owner Luke (Scott Patterson) into a serious groove, starting with an official (and incredibly sweet) first date and others that involved, if you can believe it, a SwedishPippi Longstockingmovie. And as Lorelai navigated romantic terrain in Stars Hollow (terrain that of course did not run smooth), Rory found life more complex in her second year at Yale, as her relationship with Dean became increasingly strained. Not only that, she found her attention turned towards preppy Logan (Matt Czurchy), a spoiled rich kid who represented everything Rory couldn't stand--and was of course immediately attracted to. Little did Rory know that Logan's entrance into her life, and her interaction with his family, would be the catalyst for one of the most momentous decisions she would ever make.With this season ofGilmore Girls, creative forces Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino finally found a way to make the Stars Hollow-Yale dichotomy work perfectly, as each location still stood alone but had decided repercussions on the other. Gone were freshman-year anxieties for Rory and in their place were more adult romantic concerns as well as a class consciousness that, for the first serious time, found Rory on the side of the haves and not the have-nots. While the Rory-Dean drama played itself out nicely and succinctly, it was the devilish Logan who lit a fire underneath this Gilmore girl; the episode \"You Jump, I Jump, Jack\" was a lovely twist on the '30s romantic comedies that found rich folk at play with words and deeds. Bledel started to fully blossom as Rory grew from ing&#xE9;nue to leading lady, and she was matched peerlessly by Graham, whose passion, anger, stubbornness, and ravishing beauty all came to a head in \"Wedding Bell Blues,\" which featured her two greatest nemeses: her mother and Rory's dad, Christopher (David Sutcliffe). The show's trademark eccentricities were all in place--including aPulp Fictionparty and an elementary school production ofFiddler on the Roof, among other things--but it mined the best drama of its run with the season's last four episodes, which found Rory's confidence shaken to the core. To give any of the proceedings away would spoil the drama, but suffice it to say you will be glued to the TV for this season's final four hours; it'sGilmore Girlsat its phenomenal best.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000G1R4SY", "B000N6TYLW", "B002BJGYTO", "B002BJGYTY", "B002BJGYU8", "B00B1LKXV8", "B0001CCXZW", "B006WZIAHM", "B009MA9ZW8", "B00006JIBS", "B003TY2SWC", "B00DCODLES", "B003QZSWRY", "B0077PTWHI", "B0018CWEXA", "B002ZG98Z0", "B00IXMF2K0", "B00GUOJJUW", "B0077PTWY6", "B000H7JCG4", "B003R4ZMJU", "B00EJ1IY4K", "B000NA1PUG", "B004HW7JI8", "B00BGQ2NDO", "B00BGI05Y6", "0345532767", "1416990682", "B00KS9V6EC", "B00BIR381W", "B004STBF2G", "B006WK4Y6I", "B005IA9JQ8", "B002ZG988M", "B00447L4KA", "B00A8KJN8M", "B002C6A6N6", "B00BB8ZIRK", "B009RX85N0", "B002ZG976U", "B005VPVW3I", "B00GQQ75QO"], "bought_together": ["B000G1R4SY", "B000N6TYLW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002BJGYTO", "B0001CCXZW", "B000G1R4SY", "B002BJGYTY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30042}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 18.35, "brand": "", "asin": "B000BB1MIC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51dTX8296aL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gilmore Girls: Season 5 (Digipack)"}

{"description": "This visually stunning film is the product of a collaboration of award-winning graphic novelist Neil Gaiman (creator of the much-laudedSandmanseries), his frequent collaborator Dave McKean (Cages), and The Jim Henson Company, themselves no strangers to elaborate fantasies such asThe Dark Crystal. andLabyrinth. As with the latter film,MirrorMaskfocuses on a young woman unhappy with her daily existence; here, the artistically inclined Helena (Stephanie Leonides), is at odds with her circus performer parents. When a careless insult appears to send her mother (Gina McKee) into a coma, Helena withdraws into the dark and elaborate world of her drawings, in which a scenario very similar to her predicament in the real world is unfolding. Gaiman and director McKean create arresting images to populate Helena's world, and the Henson Company brings them vividly to life with CGI; though the story is occasionally murky, the fantasy elements are imaginative enough to enthrall what will undoubtedly be the film's toughest customers--younger viewers.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005G1729K", "B002LFPBLU", "B001HN69AY", "B00000JPH6", "B00000K3D4", "B002VRNIZO", "B000934FC2", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B000EU1Q5E", "B003UAKE9Y", "B004QSQMKE", "B002UOMH00", "B000BPL2GK", "B004ALIG0G", "0060821094", "B003RHZ6IE", "B002436WFI", "B0018O4YT0", "B0011E5M66", "B0011NVC98", "B00005JPAR", "B000A283AW", "0060596384", "B002TZS5G0", "B000KJU128", "B00AEFXCLU", "0783225903", "B0031DDG9A", "B0012E2GFK", "B000C3L27U", "B008R52L8E", "B002NZK5SW", "B002FUI4CE", "B0068FZ0O2", "B00DAABKQK", "B000NJMJGG", "1616552107", "B004EPYZU8", "B00005AB62", "B002GOAH10", "B0041T52S6", "B00447L4JG", "B000YAA2SQ", "1401237541", "B00HUCF7AO", "0783225490", "0060798750", "B00003CXBK", "1593077521", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B008QE9XD2", "B003DBLDIQ", "B008JFUPPI", "B0030BS1CU", "B00077BPA0", "B0002V7O3I", "B0001Z37HM", "B002J1RZHE", "B000Q66FB6", "B002NZK5V4", "B004B93RDS", "B00006JDVV", "B0016BWACI", "B000AQOHMG", "B000E1YW2M", "B001HN694K", "B001AGXEAG", "B0010X741Y", "B006VJ1AAI", "B00C888MJ8", "B00005JLEU", "B002LFPBOM", "B0048LPRCS", "006228214X", "0061450162"], "bought_together": ["B005G1729K", "B002LFPBLU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00000JPH6", "B00000K3D4", "B00004Y7ET", "B002NZK5SW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30032}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.99, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000BT97AO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512BS13XW3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "MirrorMask"}

{"description": "Knots Landingwas aDallasspinoff that spent its first season in marked contrast to the latter series' tales of power-grabbing, greed, corruption, conspiracies, and fraternal rivalries. WhereDallasconcerned travails of an ultra-rich and influential Texas family, and its many enemies0--all great fantasy stuff--Knots Landinginitially evolved as a drama set among Southern California's suburban middle class. Built around the character Gary Ewing (Ted Shackelford), a recovering alcoholic and brother ofDallas' scheming J.R. Ewing (Larry Hagman),Knots Landingis set on a cul-de-sac in a seemingly peaceful neighborhood of modest houses. Gary, one might recall from several episodes ofDallas, is the black sheep of the Ewing clan. His marriage to the mousy Val (Joan Van Ark) was sabotaged by J.R., and their troubled teenage daughter came to live with J.R. and his parents on their expansive ranch.Knots Landingbegins with Gary and Val making a fresh start on the West Coast. If their second try at marriage works, they reckon, their daughter can come live with them in a stable environment. Gary, who wants nothing to do with the Ewing oil business, takes a job selling classic cars for his new neighbor, Sid Fairgate (Don Murray). But he reluctantly becomes embroiled, along with Val, in several local issues, the most complicated being J.R.'s plans to drill for oil just off the shore of Gary's adopted community. (Hagman, as a guest star, brings a lot of fun to that episode with his affable villainy.) It doesn't take long, however, for other major characters inKnots Landingto emerge as fascinating people in their own right, with no relationship to Ewing history except friendship with Gary and Val. In fact, Sid and his wife Karen (Michele Lee) are, arguably, the strongest characters in the first season, a couple with such strong underpinnings that their arguments inevitably result in a tighter union. Lee's performance, overall, is the best on the show, and several episodes (that look nothing like a primetime soap opera) are clearly written to spotlight her talent.Gary's other neighbors include self-centered attorney Richard Avery (John Pleshette) and his beleaguered spouse, Laura (Constance McCashin); plus the youthful if little-seen Kenny (James Houghton) and Ginger (Kim Lankford) Ward. The stories inKnots Landing: The Complete First Seasongenerally concern ordinary and familiar things: fear of crime, unexpected pregnancies, raising kids, dating, education, marital discord. Sure, many of the same conflicts occur onDallas, but the fun in watching that show is recognizing that the super-wealthy and powerful struggle with the same problems the rest of us do. InKnots Landing, conflicts are more earthbound. That won't always be the case on this show: over subsequent seasons and with the addition of more characters and the loss of others, the drama will tilt in another direction.The Complete First Seasonestablishes a solid foundation, however, and there's a lot of merit to it.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000PGUT8C", "B00005JOA4", "B00028G7LG", "B0009IW894", "B000BVM1TG", "B000QUEQ68", "B000FI9OD6", "B000JLTRFE", "B000PAAK0A", "B0016I0AGY", "B00CD45J5W", "B004H83IHI", "B000YGGNIS", "B001C9S0F0", "B0015I2S7E", "B001JAHPXA", "B001JAHPXK", "B001BN4WLS", "B0007IO6V4", "B004X1M3DE", "B001JAHPX0", "B004X1M47O", "B001JAHPWQ", "B007R915RE", "B001QU9RRK", "B00450S800", "B002VJ05EE", "B00D4ABT8K", "B009GYS70Q", "B00274SIVA", "B00E7XS4EA", "B00008EYBH", "B000H7JCGE", "B00005JO4F", "B00H5NY6F0", "B000B8IA3U", "B00074DY16", "B00008WJEZ", "B00HZMZ286", "B00CD45J52", "B00CD45JGG", "B002VJ05EO", "B002WQ79A4", "B00EFYAZAM", "B001O4KBNC", "B000GW8UAE", "B007R915U6", "B000FSMEB0", "B00JEZWRE4", "B00GM1X2RO", "1581824726", "B0030ATZH6", "B001O4KBNM", "B00FR23PDU", "B007R915QK", "B000MGBSI0", "B000OVLBH6", "B005DCJ0Q0", "B0042FDCO0", "B000ASDFIG", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B000GPPNO2", "B002OOWKYE", "B000UAE7UY", "B00A92MDU4", "B002XKKX8E", "B00GHH9HUE", "B00144K5LK", "B0001BS3IE", "B004MWLXTY", "B00A92MG1A", "B004SGWYVK", "B0028S110A", "B002JVWQR8", "B000HIVIOC", "B00GLPYVQC", "B001XW7ID6", "B000F8O2MO", "B000VDDE0E", "B005M5OSBU", "B005EVY8NA", "B003THSXJQ", "B007RMQ4CW", "B00AIA884W", "B000GFRI68", "B0018O5WTQ", "B00HXH5WNI", "B003RHZ6CK", "B0001Z3I1C", "B004WO9OMA", "B003W5C0TY", "B002AMVEEM", "B000IONJI8", "B003BGZ60Y", "B00I87U9H6", "B00HRUQA6O", "B000MGBSHQ", "B00005JO3P", "B00I87U8UE", "B000EU1QC2"], "bought_together": ["B000PGUT8C", "B00005JOA4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001VB8UCW", "B0009IW894", "B000BVM1TG", "B000PGUT8C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 27208}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 11.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000CS45AG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Rg2eJBf5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Knots Landing: The Complete First  Season"}
{"description": "Nobody does comic existential angst like Nicolas Cage, who gets a good workout inThe Weather Man, an underrated slice of quiet desperation. Cage plays David Spritz, a Chicago TV meteorologist who knows only too well the constant uncertainty of predicting the weather. Despite a possible offer from a network morning show, David's life is a mess:  he's estranged from his kids and irritated wife (Hope Davis), he's perpetually at odds with his remote father (Michael Caine), and lately people on the street have had the disconcerting habit of throwing food at him. Director Gore Verbinski (Pirates of the Caribbean) has perhaps too heavy a touch for this kind of comic melancholy, but screenwriter Steven Conrad has an interesting, almost Mamet-like ear for \"written\" dialogue--Cage has a few voiceover monologues, including an uproarious sequence involving tartar sauce and a walk to the store, that are hugely funny. It's possible that we've seen Cage in this kind of character one too many times, but he's still good at it, and his doleful face and pasted-on smile fit the mood of the picture. Unlike the heroes of most Hollywood movies, David Spritz doesn't always--or often--do the right thing, but Cage makes you want to see the poor sap make it.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00012QLB4", "B005F2JRUC", "B00005JLRE", "B000JYW5DW", "B000BBOUW2", "B001J710Z2", "B000PMFRZQ", "B000GRUMRS", "B000CNESJO", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B00E8G5HNM", "B000BYA5G4", "B000059TG6", "B004EPYZOO", "B00003CXXG", "B000IFRT5Q", "B001GCUO02", "B00BTYMPX6", "0767810856", "6304806434", "B00006LPGP", "B002TVQ48A", "B002TVQ48K", "B001MLZNLW", "B00441GZ00", "B00000G02H", "B00008L3UF", "0792838068", "B00AEBB8JM", "B00BJB2GZG", "B004XFZ4JK", "B00062IDGK", "B000OVLBF8", "B007IUEEA2", "B000B8I9Y0", "B002GHHHKG", "B00IKM5OYW", "0792844831", "B000NA1WDQ", "076780676X", "B001JIE7JC", "B00005JLSB", "B0007P0X9G", "B00007AJF8", "B00C6F61HS", "6304711891", "B00005JL7Q", "B00005JK8K", "B00005JN5E", "B00004Z4WR", "B004SIP95G", "B00003CXPV", "B00003L9CH", "B00000JGHL", "B00275EHBY", "B00003CWTI", "B0071HPOV0", "B0015OKWKS", "B002VECMAE", "B00HUCF6KK", "B0039UT3LK", "6301971345", "B000EHRVOW", "B00AEFYAC0", "B000H0MKOC", "B005DCJ2DG", "B00007J5VQ", "B002ZG99KO", "B003102JDM", "B0009R1TI6", "B002CPMB9O", "B00BB67UNW", "B000FDEVA2", "B000CBCWRG", "B000066TGP", "B0013D8LC2", "B00020HAX8", "B00005JLO8", "B00005JLFA", "B001P3SA8K", "B002ZG980U", "B0045HCJFS", "B006TTC5MM", "B000DZIGDU", "B000H6SXSI", "B00AEBB9CS", "B000EDWKXI", "B000NIVJF4", "B00062IVM6", "B00009K011", "B0015OKWKI", "B009L79YFU", "B00005JMJG", "B0002W4UDE", "B000286RNE", "B002ZG983M", "B000UJ48SQ", "B000MEYFY6", "B00008EY9G", "B00AEBB9WI"], "bought_together": ["B00012QLB4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00012QLB4", "B000JLTRIQ", "B005F2JRUC", "B000JYW5DW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 132923}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.47, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B000CSUNQQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JTWC5Y4HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Weather Man (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Any fan of Steve Martin's2000 novellawill enjoy this pitch-perfect adaptation, which glowingly captures the bittersweet tones of a May-December romance. Martin wrote the screenplay and stars as Ray Porter, a button-down 50-something executive who reaches out to a much younger woman as a Los Angeles playmate. The book and movie, though, are both primarily about Mirabelle (Claire Danes), a 20-something with a pile of promises, debt, and depression, as she fades away into a slow corner of Saks selling unneeded formal gloves. She's a wisp of a person, with a cat who doesn&#x92;t love her, and when she finds a suitor, it's Jeremy (Jason Schwartzman), a scruffy artist who babbles on about speakers. When the gentlemanly Porter calls, his appearance in her life begins to make her whole. It also immediately sets her up for sadness--Ray thinks of Mirabella as a precious outlet for sex, while Mirabelle, very mistakenly, sees Ray as a potential lifelong mate. Martin deftly turns the novella's prose into dialogue, allowing the movie to feel full-bodied, and the film also works as a comedy, as we witness Jeremy's growth on the road with a rock band. Schwartzman would walk away with film if not for the perfectly cast leads: Martin does another smart turn away from his wild-and-crazy moniker, Danes has never been better in an Oscar-worthy performance, and Bridgette Wilson-Sampras aces her role as a hot-to-trot co-worker of Mirabelle's. Whoever's decision to have Martin be the omnipresent narrator, though, should be penalized, as it&#x92;s confusing to have him in two roles, and the information is pretty useless, even robbing the film of a final grace note.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000F5FNPC", "B000F6IODE", "B000BYY11Y", "B00079HZUM", "B00008979G", "B000V6LSOA", "B003BZ58RQ", "B005Z9MH7U", "B0012BR8DI", "B0000797IO", "B000VY1EYG", "0786891076", "B000062WWZ", "B00081U7HC", "B00005JMJ4", "B004499LX0", "B00B9ZD73M", "B0016MJ6HY", "B0064MT1FI", "B000EQHXNW", "0767818105", "B00005JMWP", "B000BX8R10", "B0038N9WKU", "B000056BSJ", "1419897543", "B00ADRYCWC", "B004L3AR0K", "B002ONC9NC", "0783227353", "B000NIVJFY", "B00IKM5OCO", "B005Z9MGRG", "6305428239", "B0002KPIQY", "B000CNESJO", "B000035Z3C", "B000EDWKXI", "B0010X8NF0", "078322740X", "B000053VB5", "B00AEFY8MM", "B00007JXWX", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B000BBOUUE", "B001UV4XGU", "0786866586", "B000IU37SO", "0783229402", "B0071HPP3M", "B00IXD2LJY", "B000ADWDFC", "B000GFRI54", "B0000640VJ", "6305308802", "B000067J1O", "B004XVMCKS", "B002T51X4Q", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B0001Z4P2I", "B004XVMCK8", "B000B8QG22", "B003Z8ZC2A", "B001KP2J2G", "B004D45NYC", "B00005JMBQ", "B00AEBB8P6", "B00005JL7Q", "B00007AJE1", "B00BMKGZVA", "B00BEIYGK2", "B000CS45TW", "B00005JMJD", "B00005KHJJ", "B00319ECBK", "B0068MNO2U", "B004LWZWBU", "B0013D8LCC", "B004GJYRA0", "B000LXHK2C", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B001P3SA8K", "B003Y5H574", "B000T988I8", "B002ZFEQ76", "B001URA5Y8", "B002ZG99UE", "B00G3DA5XA", "0767815122", "B001UV4XUG", "B00AEBB9G4", "B00FWSWIUU", "B0001O3YV2", "B00AADAEBW", "B00008972P", "B001MM3AZM", "B00AEFXJ86", "B00A18CG76", "B004H83IG4", "B00803PFWM"], "bought_together": ["B000F6IODE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0786866586", "B00079HZUM", "B007HW18CS", "B002WY65VA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30533}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.45, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B000EDWKX8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51vVNaGhmPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Shopgirl"}
{"description": "A masterpiece of postwar Japanese cinema, Yasujiro Ozu'sLate Springserves as an elegant primer for many of the themes that would define Ozu's later career. As with other Ozu classics, this is a calm, meditative drama about the dynamics of family, in this case the inevitable separation of 56-year-old father and widower Shukichi (Chishu Ryu) and his adult daughter Noriko (Setsuko Hara), who is content to care for her father and remain unmarried, despite the urging of friends and relatives to find a suitable husband. There are some viable candidates, and several attempts at matchmaking, but the likeliest match is a man who's already engaged. Noriko simply wishes for things to remain as they are, but when she does eventually marry a handsome chemist who \"looks like Gary Cooper,\" Ozu's drama remains intimately focused on the subtle emotions at play; there's not a scene or sequence that feels out of place, andLate Springserves a secondary function as a light and lively portrait of post-war Japan, as hints of Western influence (like a Coca-Cola sign in one of the film's most memorable scenes) that signal Japan's transition toward a modern commercial economy. Most of all, however,Late Springis a carefully observed and quietly heartbreaking story of a parent who yearns to set things right for his daughter who must balance her father's love with her own prospects for a fulfilling future. And while Ozu would go on to examine familial issues in later, equally noteworthy films,Late Springrepresents a milestone that would ensure Ozu his rightful place among the greatest of all Japanese directors.--Jeff ShannonOn the DVDsCriterion's release ofLate Springcontains a few minor flaws in terms of image quality (such as occasional emulsion scratches), but viewers can rest assured that this DVD was mastered from the finest available materials, and the film looks very good considering the conditions of post-war Japan that were typically harsh on films of that period. The \"windowbox\" framing format accurately preserves the film's original 1.33:1 aspect ratio. There's a new and improved English subtitle translation, and the audio commentary by Richard Pe&#xF1;a (an Ozu expert and program director of New York's Film Society of Lincoln Center) emphasizes the literary traditions that inform Ozu's films, in addition to the director's signature fixed-camera, low-angle style. Disc 2 includesTokyo-ga, the 1985 feature by German director (and avid Ozu admirer) Wim Wenders. It's a tribute to Ozu's Japan, in which Wenders wanders the city searching for remnants of Tokyo as seen in Ozu's films, including interviews withLate Springactor Chishu Ryu and Ozu's long-time cameraman Yuharu Atsuta. In keeping with Criterion tradition, a 21-page booklet is also included, containing informative essays by critic Michael Atkinson and renowned Japanese-film historian Donald Richie.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JLV7", "B00026L7MC", "B000OPPAF6", "B001BEK8CE", "B0001GH5RY", "B003ICZW7S", "B000NOK0H6", "B0012Z3630", "B00EO2I6W4", "B000BB14I0", "B00CEIOHPU", "B00005JLMU", "0780023307", "6305744114", "B001BEK8E2", "B00092ZLEY", "B000KRNGNQ", "B004S801ZO", "6305257450", "B005D0RDPM", "B005152C7S", "B00005QAPH", "0520032772", "0780022343", "B00005B1ZL", "B0019X400S", "B00005AUK9", "B00B2BYXSQ", "B00005JLEJ", "B00A8QDI3M", "6305131104", "B0000YEEHG", "B002U6DVQ2", "B000AQKUD6", "B005HK13S6", "B000PKG6O4", "B0009WIE2A", "B001TIQT7A", "B00005M2C7", "B00180R072", "B00000IOKV", "B000G8NXYG", "B00003CXUM", "B008CJ0JS4", "B000BR6QCI", "B005KQVE1S", "B0002J4X20", "7885729117", "B0001UZZSG", "B00K5EJHGO", "B00005BHW6", "B00AQ6J6H6", "B005MXQD74", "B0035ECI0S", "B000XPSC0C", "B009RWRINE", "B000A5044C", "B000083C5F", "B00012L786", "B000I8OOG0", "B001298BPY", "B001CW7ZTE", "B0001UZZSQ", "B0007989Y8", "B00005A8TX", "B000305ZYS", "B003D63G5E", "B000093NR0", "B00005UQ7T", "B00004W3HF", "B00005NC66", "B000BB14IA", "B0012SY0E6", "B00B2BYXYA", "B004WPYO7E", "B00019JR5Y", "B001WLMOL4", "B000E5LEV0", "B00HRJVHEK", "B0002DB4YQ", "B003TY2SNG", "B00DHN8GGW", "B0000633SD", "B00180R06I", "B000N2HBIO", "B0002DCHQA", "B00CUKTH34", "B00CUKTGQM", "B002XUL6SA", "B004M66YUS", "B00393SG0G", "B002U6DVPS", "B00006CXGZ", "B004WPYO7Y", "B000ZM1MIM", "B006X96P6U", "B007N5YJPC", "B00005QAPJ", "B003ICZW7I"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLV7", "B00026L7MC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00EO2I6W4", "B000NOK0H6", "B000OPPAF6", "B00008RH1H"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 155494}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 26.99, "brand": "Image Entertainment", "asin": "B000EOTWIS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51vG5GCICzL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Late Spring (The Criterion Collection)"}

{"description": "What was in the Hatch? The cliffhanger from season one of Lost was answered in its opening sequences, only to launch into more questions as the season progressed. That's right: Just when you say \"Ohhhhh,\" there comes another \"What?\" Thankfully, the show's producers sprinkle answers like tasty morsels throughout the season, ending with a whopper: What caused Oceanic Air Flight 815 to crash in the first place? As the show digs into more revelations about its inhabitant's pasts, it also devotes a good chunk to new characters (Hey, it's an island; you never know who you're going to run into.) First, there are the \"Tailies,\" passengers from the back end of the plane who crashed on the other side of the island. Among them are the wise, God-fearing ex-drug lord Mr. Eko (standout Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje); devoted husband Bernard (Sam Anderson); psychiatrist Libby (Cynthia Watros, whose character has more than one hidden link to the other islanders); and ex-cop Ana Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez), by far the most infuriating character on the show, despite how much the writers tried to incur sympathy with her flashback. Then there are the Others, first introduced when they kidnapped Walt (Malcolm David Kelley) at the end of season one. Brutal and calculating, their agenda only became more complex when one of them (played creepily by Michael Emerson) was held hostage in the hatch and, quite handily, plays mind games on everyone's already frayed nerves. The original cast continues to battle their own skeletons, most notably Locke (Terry O'Quinn), Sun (Yunjin Kim) and Michael (Harold Perrineau), whose obsession with finding Walt takes a dangerous turn. The love triangle between Jack (Matthew Fox), Kate (Evangeline Lilly) and Sawyer (Josh Holloway), which had stalled with Sawyer's departure, heats up again in the second half. Despite the bloating cast size (knocked down by a few by season's end) Lost still does what it does best: explores the psyche of people, about whom \"my life is an open book\" never applies, and cracks into the social dynamics of strangers thrust into Lord of the Flies-esque situations. Is it all a science experiment? A dream? A supernatural pocket in the universe? Likely, any theory will wind up on shaky ground by the season's conclusion. But hey, that's the fun of it. This show was made for DVD, and you can pause and slow-frame to your heart's content. Just try and keep that head-spinning to a minimum.On the DVDCommentaries by various cast members and producers reveal little other than the occasional easter egg (the Dharma logo on the shark fin, Walt's mumbling translating to \"Don't push the button; the button is bad\" backwards). But disc seven opens with an eerie Hanso Foundation instructional video, leading you to eight hours of bonus features, including cast members' own theories, deleted scenes, and featurettes on specific episodes. It's all well and good for Lost fanatics, but if you want the cream of the crop, check out: \"Lost Connections,\" an interactive feature that reveals how all the islanders are actually linked (for instance, one of the officers who captured Sayid during the Gulf War is Kate's father); a Channel UK promo for the show directed by David LaChappelle in which cast members suck in their cheeks and, dressed in evening wear, tango in slow motion as if in a Calvin Klein ad (it has to be a joke, right?); and \"The World According to Sawyer,\" which strings together each of the un-PC nicknames and pop culture references spewed by Holloway's character. Favorites include \"Chewie\" for Jin and \"Ponce de Leon\" for Ana Lucia. It's by far the cherry on top of a sweet dessert. --Ellen A.

{"description": "Wes Craven served as executive producer on this direct-to-video chiller about a group of friends who discover that the remote island they've chosen as a vacation spot is home to a wild pack of attack dogs. After dispatching a sailboater and his bikini-clad girlfriend, the canines (which look more cuddly than ferocious) pick off the interloping friends with all-too-human cunning; the survivors have just enough time to discover that the mutts are the product of military genetic experiments to create unstoppable attack dogs. Director Nick Mastrandrea (a longtime production associate of both Craven and George Romero) lends a professional look to his debut feature, and gets decent performances from his cast (which includesLost's Michelle Rodriguez, Taryn Manning, and Oliver Hudson), but the script is tired almost from page one, and the resulting action and gore do little to help this indie picture stand out from the rest of the horror crowd. Dog lovers with soft hearts should be forewarned that the CGI stand-ins for the animal actors endure some gruesome abuse in the course of the picture.&#x96;-Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000JJRYDS", "B00000FZL2", "B00003CXNY", "B00005V9I6", "B001O5LVVC", "B00BNAE14W", "B000WTVZGC", "B00005QAPB", "B000RW5BZ0", "B000EQ5V8G", "B000NVT0TI", "B001AR0D5Y", "6305943133", "B003ZZ7TPG", "B000099T3U", "B00AIZ2FPK", "B004USUP58", "B000WC389G", "B00BMUL8QC", "B003W2M6LE", "B003954IV0", "B0034G4OVS", "B00008YOLV", "B0006HBZYC", "B002ZG98KK", "B002GHHHL0", "B003VE9WP6", "B000P0I4O4", "B000SAGGSC", "B00AZTUUQK", "B00JF5GAIW", "B007QD0USG", "B0009X76XC", "B001J4E19C", "B000OVLBGM", "B00DRQETEW", "B0000D0YVO", "B000GIW9I2", "B000RGN2JI", "B00111YM56", "B003O7I6S4", "B002ZG98C8", "B009IV2Z7S", "B001QMCJ0U", "B003ZXDP24", "B00064X5L6", "B000VSDNFA", "B0009KQP7S", "B004FHCHAU", "B004P7CN3G", "B003L20IEW", "B00E8AVNAE", "B002ZG99IG", "B008DL4LQ2", "B004BLTNM0", "B0002J4X1Q", "B001YYQ9S8", "B00D3LA6M0", "B0068RHSCW", "B000E8M0P6", "B00196UTEG", "B001221DUQ", "B0021L8UPS", "B002TZS5GU", "B000GYI3B8", "B00008EYA5", "B000GLL1U6", "1573628174", "B001DSNEK6", "0767802497", "B003UN0752", "B001RXDM18", "B000BNX3BE", "B00B96TGQS", "B000OCZ9WS", "B000JBXHQY", "B00CPN933U", "B00005JMDZ", "B00A1AU72A", "B000096I9O", "B004LWZW6K", "B008NNY8RM", "B00AEBB91E", "B0021L8UXA", "B00CNIDHM0", "B00I099JO6", "B004P7CN7W", "B0010AN7PY", "B00A6YR6DY", "B000OCY7TY", "B00125WAS2", "B00AEFYV9W", "B005GT3X68", "B000FII30Q", "B007XF0XUW", "B0002WT4OE", "B007VYEDHO", "B0037E8HNI", "B009MO57H6", "B008JFUNYG"], "bought_together": ["B000JJRYDS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000JJRYDS", "B000OCZ9WS", "B00005QAPB", "B000NVT0TI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 71629}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.88, "brand": "First Look Pictures", "asin": "B000G1ALDY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ez6Q-dHvL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Breed"}
{"description": "Forget any off-screen impressions you may have of Mel Gibson, and experience Apocalypto as the mad, bloody runaway train that it is. The story is set in the pre-Columbian Maya population: one village is brutally overrun, its residents either slaughtered or abducted, by a ruling tribe that needs slaves and human sacrifices. We focus on the capable warrior Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), although Gibson skillfully sketches a whole population of characters--many of whom don't survive the early reels. Most of the film is set in the dense jungle, but the middle section, in a grand Mayan city, is a dazzling triumph of design, costuming, and sheer decadent terror. The movie itself is a triumph of brutality, as Gibson lets loose his well-established fascination with bodily mortification in a litany of assaults including impalement, evisceration, snakebite, and bee stings. It's a dark, disgusted vision, but Gibson doesn't forget to apply some very canny moviemaking instincts to the violence--including the creation of a tremendous pair of villains (strikingly played by Raoul Trujillo and Rodolfo Palacias). The film is in a Maya dialect, subtitled in English, and shot on digital video (which occasionally betrays itself in some blurry quick pans). Amidst all the mayhem, nothing in the film is more devastating than a final wordless exchange of looks between captured villager Blunted (Jonathan Brewer) and his wife's mother (Maria Isabel Diaz), a superb change in tone from their early relationship. Yes, this is an obsessive, crazed movie, but Gibson knows what he's doing. --Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000UVV24M", "B0012Q732O", "B00003CXAF", "B001BNFRB2", "B000VMIILU", "1573623903", "B002O3Z50Q", "B00004XPPG", "6305692688", "B00028HBKM", "B00004RJ71", "B00AEFXKUI", "B002ZG999U", "B0002YLCG0", "B000VKL6ZM", "B002T9H2LA", "B0000542C6", "B0001CNQX0", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00006ADD5", "B00406UK7S", "B004AOECXI", "B004SIP8W0", "B000R9U3B0", "B00008G8LY", "B00001ZWUS", "B000MGB6NM", "B003EYVXXW", "6304711905", "B004HO6HWA", "B000QXDED6", "B0034G4P58", "B0000714BS", "B000XR9L50", "B00005JLQT", "0783230389", "B002VWNIEA", "B00AZNEW5G", "B008MIMWQW", "B003VA3JZY", "B0002DRDIW", "B000AARKOO", "B00BEJL6JK", "B004SIP7TE", "079283366X", "B00005V9HH", "B000M341QE", "B003HKN52U", "B005IUIXCE", "B00275EGWY", "B003UYUQZW", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002O3Z510", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B002WY65VU", "B000I0RNWU", "B00003CXWV", "B002XMGGK6", "B003NF97NK", "B000QXDCJ2", "B001FB5634", "B001DZOC6Y", "B007STBUHI", "B0000VCZMK", "B0013FDM7E", "B00015YVDG", "B003IY498Y", "6305433925", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005K3NR", "B000O76ZQC", "B003ELKNH2", "B00018D3ZA", "6304821832", "B00AEBBA36", "B009YQJ322", "B00005JL3T", "079284646X", "B002CA68MU", "B00BTYJYR6", "B00AEFYE08", "B000P0J09C", "B005LAIHPE", "B00441GZ1Y", "B001OQCV2E", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000BITV9W", "B004LWZW4M", "B005LAIIRQ", "B00003CXBH", "B000A2WP7O", "B001GCUO0W", "B00005JPD0", "B00AMSLDTM", "B000RTB0R6", "B00005JA8B", "B00009PY4G", "0783226039", "B000B8QG22", "B000069I1I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001BNFRB2", "B00028HBKM", "B00001ZWUS", "B00004XPPG"]}, "price": 10.55, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 53938}, "asin": "B000GNOKQG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41yXQu76-NL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Apocalypto (2006) (2007) Rudy Youngblood; Raoul Trujillo; Mel Gibson"}

{"description": "Before returning to the television fold in the '80s with a string of successful TV movies, Peter Falk's Lt. Columbo concluded his network sleuthing with eight episodes that aired between 1976-1978; these final two seasons of the originalColumboseries are packaged in this no-frills boxed set that should be a welcome addition to any armchair detective's collection. Quality-wise, the performances, writing, and direction in these eight episodes are as top notch as any that preceded it, with a host of terrific guest stars doing their best to match wits with the lieutenant in a string of complex mysteries. William Shatner gives a typically juicy turn as a demanding TV actor facing blackmail in the sixth season opener \"Fade in to Murder\"; Theodore Bikel and Sorrell Booke (The Dukes of Hazzard) are friends, business partners, and bitter rivals in \"The Bye-Bye Sky High IQ Murder Case\" (and watch for Jamie Lee Curtis in a bit role as a waitress); the great Ruth Gordon (Harold and Maude) shines as a wily mystery writer in the seventh season's \"Try and Catch Me,\" while a host of fine character actors (including the late Mako, Richard Dysart and Michael V. Gazzo) have reasons for wanting food critic Louis Jourdan dead in \"Murder Under Glass,\" and a very young Kim Cattrall helps Columbo unravel a mystery involving mind control and trained dogs in \"How to Dial a Murder.\" The talent behind the camera in these episodes is equally impressive: Jonathan Demme helms \"Murder Under Glass,\" while Leo Penn takes the final episode, \"The Conspirators.\" As with all of the originalColumboshows (and many of the subsequent TV movies), the episodes presented here are smartly written, crisply acted by a quality cast, and anchored with sly charm and deceptive strength by Falk's Emmy-winning performance. PreviousColumbobox sets have included an episode of the spin-off seriesMrs. Columboas an extra, but no such supplement is included here.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BF0C7A", "B00DZP1C18", "B0009NZ36O", "B000MV9OMM", "B0007CNY4K", "B0049GYXBS", "B005TFVM0I", "B001JNNDRY", "B0002COTDA", "B00DZP1C0O", "B00005JO3P", "B001S86IYK", "B00H4ZEJCO", "B000WQWPSM", "B001JFKWE4", "B000TXPXCS", "B000XJD3K2", "B001DHXT7U", "B003QTDH8E", "B000KGH00C", "B00ALTQRNO", "B000BGR1B4", "B000BF0C8E", "B000MQCUJ6", "B00H4ZEJ6K", "B004VK759Y", "B0011UF79M", "B000UX6TJI", "B002ZTLVXY", "B003IB0FTE", "B002JIOOAS", "B005D7E7ZY", "B004XH9X4U", "B00363WGJG", "B004HHX9PK", "B001E6HUWK", "B000N2HD6O", "B000PGTPC8", "B00005JN8S", "B003ZJ0POO", "B00AJXO48W", "B0019F030M", "B000LXGXY8", "B005UL4NF2", "B000GRU09I", "B006IRQUIA", "B000B5XSVM", "B000NOIX66", "B0025X4PAQ", "B0021FP3PO", "B00005JNHT", "B0030Y12BO", "B001V7UX4O", "B001UDPA9C", "B0042RJWTW", "B002OID512", "B0014FAIXE", "B001675ZJM", "B001KZVQJS", "B003RHZ6CK", "0786719397", "B0096W46PS", "B000IHYXJO", "B004VK74EA", "B00CD45JCU", "B00GOC74QG", "B0012Z36FI", "B001GMH8WO", "B005JZBPJ6", "B000F48D0U", "B00BW4S87A", "B000UAE7VS", "B0007LXP86", "0786717955", "B0012EM5EW", "B002LP2DNY", "B0006TPE1U", "B00005JNHS", "B00005JNHU", "B0087GKIQU", "B00C7A8WNS", "B0007Y3XRG", "B008I34Y3K", "B000TXPXD2", "B00H3L86F0", "B000BUE5DC", "B00HV0TJM2", "B00J2G4ZAY", "B000HWZ4HU", "B00GHH9HW2", "B001NABGKE", "B00E8AVN9A", "B00GM1X2RO", "B00JEZWRE4", "B009R5H6OM", "B0095FJHXC", "B0002NY81C", "B000AL733G", "B000TZX5XK", "B00ESK1PES"], "bought_together": ["B000BF0C7A", "B0009NZ36O"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BF0C7A", "B000MV9OMM", "B001JNNDRY", "B005TFVM0I"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 16669}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 13.99, "brand": "Uni", "asin": "B000HT3Q1Y", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F5B59EKFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Columbo - The Complete Sixth and Seventh Seasons"}

{"description": "Sweet baby Jesus, we thank you for blessing Will Ferrell and Adam McKay with the talent to create a NASCAR comedy as hilarious asTalladega Nights. The so-called \"Ballad of Ricky Bobby\" is hardly flawless  in fact it's not always firing on all cylinders  but with comedy star Ferrell and director McKay still hot from the success of their previous comedy hitAnchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, most of this 108-minute spoof of oval-track racing is so knee-slappin' funny that you can't help but surrender to the stupidity.Obviously, Ferrell's the shining star, and his portrayal of lead-footed pit-crew-member-turned-#1 NASCAR champion Ricky \"I Wanna Go Fast\" Bobby (how can you not love that name?) is spot-on perfect, righteously spoofing the entirety of NASCAR culture without insulting its oft-ridiculed roots in redneck bootlegging of a bygone era. You could even argue that Talladega Nights is truer to NASCAR than Tom Cruise'sDays of Thunder, and it's certainly more entertaining, especially when you add John C. Reilly as Ricky's life-long pal, teammate, and eventual rival Cal Naughton, Jr. (together they're nicknamed \"Shake 'n Bake\"), and Sacha Baron Cohen (fromDa Ali G ShowandBorat) as gay French \"Formula Un\" driver-turned NASCAR rival Jean Girrard, to a stellar cast including Molly Shannon, Greg Germann, Amy Adams and Michael Clarke Duncan.Sure, it's mostly a showcase for Ferrell's loud, over-the-top antics and nonsensical non sequiturs (like cameo appearances by Elvis Costello and Mos Def), but with Ferrell behind the wheel,Talladega Nightsrolls into victory lane with fuel to spare, and there's one final bit of comedy (with a tip of the hat to William Faulkner) for those who sit through the credits. --Jeff ShannonStills fromTalladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby(click for larger image)More NASCAR andTalladega Nightsat Amazon.comThe CalendarOn blu-rayNASCAR on PSPOur NASCAR StoreNASCAR The Imax ExperienceSpeed, Guts, and GloryBookOther Will Ferrell FilmsAnchor ManElfThe Best of Will FerrellMore Films by Will Ferrell", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000WZEZFY", "B001G5T6H6", "B000HRMCTI", "B0007TS24U", "B0009K7RT8", "B00096S49O", "B000EJ9VDY", "B000KF0GSQ", "B000OVLBFI", "B000AM8RQM", "B000SH3XCM", "B00000G02A", "B001F76PDI", "B000ELL1P8", "B000A6QMQA", "B002EQFXZA", "B000L2125O", "B0009Z3LGQ", "B000ASBKHE", "B0009NSDCK", "B000FIS7HK", "B0007TFLLM", "B0012IWO08", "B002SD94AY", "B003L51GW2", "B0007V46JI", "B000ASDFGS", "B000IFRT5G", "B0008JFMEW", "B000GPVUMG", "B000AQ6904", "B002BSC57U", "B0009VCSXW", "B0008JFMF6", "B000R3BN4M", "B007M6W36Y", "B000BYRCHE", "B0009RCPV6", "B000E1YW04", "B002I0GZBI", "B0009X7BFA", "B000B5IP6U", "B0009KQOME", "B000A0GP5Y", "B000ENUYFE", "B0050JN84Q", "B000BGZRTC", "B003DS4Z6Q", "B001KMRN0M", "B000G8O0MU", "B000EWBKU8", "B0047ERZ7Q", "B000KKRD2S", "B00168PFFK", "B00311G2DY", "B00083G5CG", "B002BS47WG", "B0007Z2556", "B0009FU10U", "B000B8IA4E", "B0045SE9XC", "B000AAJTM0", "B0019C6KAC", "B000F2DE8S", "B0011VPYIK", "B0009350CQ", "B0009NJFPY", "B000ADWD2A", "B000FYZS6M", "B000VIUNZI", "B000AQ690Y", "B0009WPZPY", "B003ALEWKU", "B000F4PDEO", "B000A7Q1XI", "B000803BQM", "B0009K7RTI", "B000MNP2KS", "B000NIBUQW", "B000BKJ76C", "B0013KPSDA", "B007ZH9OFI", "B000059TMB", "B002TPTDFC", "B000A3XYE6", "B00151QYU8", "B000F5GJO6", "B0009VRHME", "B0009W5JAA", "B0009RCPXE", "B000BW7QV8", "B0009NSE42", "B001IZNIVE", "B000BYRCRO", "B000B5IOVQ", "B000B5IOW0", "B00083FZH2"], "bought_together": ["B000WZEZFY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001G5T6GW", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00B65JMEI", "B00AEFXJS6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 199481}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.5, "brand": "Son", "asin": "B000J3OTO6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MwbfwtGuL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Talladega Nights - The Ballad of Ricky Bobby [UMD for PSP]"}

{"description": "A remake of the Italian filmL'Ultimo Bacio,The Last Kisswas largely ignored in theaters despite its Gen-X themes and appeal of star Zach Braff (Scrubs), who last made a splash in theaters with his similar twentysomething angst filmGarden State. A drama about midlife crises (mostly for people approaching 30, that is), director Tony Goldwyn (A Walk on the Moon) has assembled a top-notch cast, but there's not enough likeability in the characters to care. Architect Michael (Zach Braff) is a commitmentphobe who wanders into a flirtation with coed Kim (Rachel Bilson) because he's gun-shy about settling down with his perfect girlfriend Jenna (Jacinda Barrett), who's expecting his child. His fellow pals face their own romantic crossroads; one (Michael Weston) desires to settle down with a woman who doesn't love him back; another (Eric Christian Olsen) can't find someone who just wants a meaningless fling like him; and the third (Casey Affleck), ponders leaving his weary wife who's constantly berating his shortcomings as a father. Most depressing is Jenna's mother (Blythe Danner), who's tired of feeling neglected by her stoic husband (Tom Wilkinson). Danner and Wilkinson are compelling as longtime marrieds who've lost their spark, but Braff's character is wholly unlikeable, even aside from his indiscretions. The bright spot is Bilson, in her first movie role, utterly adorable as the sexy college student who's got more parts vulnerability and sass than any stuck in the Other Woman role. There's some fine acting inThe Last Kiss, but not enough character development to care about anything they're going through.The DVD includes a commentary featuring cast members Braff, Barrett, Olsen, Bilson, and director Goldwyn, who all mainly hoot during Olsen's sex scenes and ogle Bilson's seductive dancing. Braff and Goldwyn also imitate Bilson's high-pitched speedchatter throughout, while Barrett educates the cast on the similarities between \"the dingo ate my baby\" and the O.J. Simpson case (don't ask).

{"description": "Pile together a blue-ribbon cast, a screenplay high in quirkiness, and the Sundance stamp of approval, and youve got yourself a crossover indie hit. That formula worked for Little Miss Sunshine, a frequently hilarious study of family dysfunction. Meet the Hoovers, an Albuquerque clan riddled with depression, hostility, and the tattered remnants of the American Dream; despite their flakiness, they manage to pile into a VW van for a weekend trek to L.A. in order to get moppet daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) into the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. Much of the pleasure of this journey comes from watching some skillful comic actors doing their thing: Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette as the parents (hes hoping to become a self-help authority), Alan Arkin as a grandfather all too willing to give uproariously inappropriate advice to a sullen teenage grandson (Paul Dano), and a subdued Steve Carell as a jilted gay professor on the verge of suicide. The film is a crowd-pleaser, and if anything is a little too eager to bend itself in the direction of quirk-loving Sundance audiences; it can feel forced. But the breezy momentum and the ingenious actors help push the material over any bumps in the road. -- Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000YABYLA", "B00005JMJG", "B001UV4XGU", "B00A81MV3U", "B00DL46ZN8", "B00005JNC2", "B0007TKOAA", "B001UV4XUG", "B00005ALS0", "B00118T632", "B00AEFXESQ", "B007L6VR12", "B008220BA2", "B003L20ICE", "B0000640VJ", "B008OHV49W", "B001P9KR8U", "B000A7DVR2", "B00000F5MN", "B007L6VRBM", "B00AFEY354", "B0001GOH6Q", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00337KM2S", "B000H0MKOC", "B004UXUX4Q", "B0034G4OZE", "B00011CZRE", "B00275EGWY", "0205751989", "B000FVQLQQ", "B0010X8NF0", "B004SIP95G", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B004QL7KKC", "B00079Z9VO", "B00003CXZ4", "B0021L8UOY", "B001MM3AZM", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00606P0BM", "B00005Q4CS", "B00ADRYCWC", "B001TOD92C", "B004SEUIW4", "B000P0J0EW", "B0015OKWKI", "B000CS464G", "B0007PLLBU", "B00009W5CA", "B00005JLSB", "B004A8ZWV0", "B007RKFXUS", "B0010AN7Z4", "B00012QLB4", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B003UESJH4", "B00005JNBQ", "B007VYE4PK", "B000WZEZGI", "B00AEBB9F0", "6304907729", "B003Y5H574", "B000SFOW8I", "B00005JMJ4", "B001BL96K2", "B00006FMUW", "B002VPTJOA", "B00003CXO1", "B000J103OI", "B0038N9WKU", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00008975Z", "B003ASLJQI", "B0049985XW", "B003ASLJO0", "B001J9KJ4I", "B001FZQOW2", "B00000G02H", "1557047707", "B000BYRCQU", "B00121QGPY", "B00005JL57", "B000021Y77", "B000A3XY5A", "B000MZHW40", "B0000AC8LR", "B00AEFY0KW", "B0045HCJ9E", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B00AEBB9FA", "B00005A06N", "B000ELJAEM", "B00AEFYAMA", "B00E8RKHWW", "B00005JLRE", "B005LAIHE0", "B000M341QE", "B0039UT3LK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00118T632", "B00DL46ZN8", "B0007UC8Y4", "B001AGXEAG"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 401537}, "asin": "B000JU9OJ4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51T7A7BDBWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Little Miss Sunshine [Region 2]"}

Through interviews with two U.S. Congressmen, former IRS Commissioner and former IRS and FBI agents, tax attorneys and authors, Russo connects the dots between money creation, federal income tax, and the national identity card, which becomes law in May 2008 and will use Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology.

{"description": "Out patrolling a California highway, police officer Edward Malus (Nicolas Cage) stops a station wagon to return a little girl's lost doll. Moments later, a runaway truck slams into the station wagon, igniting it into a fiery wreck with the mother and child trapped inside. Edward fails to save them before the car explodes...and then spends months of his life choking down pills to get the image of their faces out of his head. But Edward is about to get a second chance. A desperate letter from his former girlfriend, Willow (Kate Beahan), arrives at his home with no postmark. Willow came into his life and left just as unexpectedly years before. But now, her daughter Rowan has gone missing, and Edward is theonly person she trusts to help locate her. She asks him to come to her home on a private island - Summersisle - a place with its own traditions where people observe a forgotten way of life. Edward seizes the opportunity to make his life right again, and soon finds himself on a seaplane bound for the islands of the Pacific Northwest. But nothing is what it seems on isolated Summersisle, where a culture, dominated by its matriarch Sister Summersisle (Ellen Burstyn), is bound together by arcane traditions and a pagan festival called \"the Day of Death and Rebirth.\" The secretive people of Summersisle only ridicule his investigation, insisting that a child named Rowan never existed there... or if she ever did was no longer alive. But what Edward doesn't know is that Willow's plea for help has invited more into his life than a chance for redemption. In unraveling Summersisle's closely held secrets, Edward is drawn into a web of ancient traditions and murderous deceit, and each step he takes closer to the lost child brings him one step closer to the unspeakable. And one step closer to the Wicker Man.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001J710Y8", "B000PMFRZQ", "B002TVQ48K", "B000GRUMRS", "B0073U2ETK", "B001J710Z2", "B004EPYZOO", "B00012QLB4", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B001KRVLCI", "B000CSUNQQ", "B001GCUO02", "B00AEBB8JM", "B000CFYAMC", "6304806434", "B004XFZ4JK", "B000OVLBF8", "B000BBOUW2", "B000BYA5G4", "B000059TG6", "B004EI2NMM", "B00BFNJHCI", "B00004Z4WR", "B001KKU9CI", "0792838068", "6304711891", "B003ZD9DSO", "B00BJB2GZG", "B00003CXIV", "6305760403", "B00BTYMPX6", "B000U7169M", "B00IKM5LXG", "B001DZOC6Y", "B007IUEEA2", "B00062IDGK", "B00003CXXG", "B003YF9PX6", "B00092ZLSK", "B00005JLRE", "B000TJ6PBK", "B00441GZ00", "B005F2JRUC", "0792844831", "B000FI8MPW", "B0000AGWMF", "B00005JN5E", "0767810856", "B000YNFXZA", "B000OVLBGM", "B00006LPGP", "B00020HAX8", "B0010YVCB6", "B0009X763M", "B00005JP3R", "B000RZGHSM", "B000EHRVP6", "B00008L3UF", "B000286S1U", "B00DNJ95S8", "B009L79YFU", "B00KCTG4PO", "B005DR64OQ", "B0019X3YX2", "B000RZGHSW", "B00406UK7S", "B000JLTRIQ", "B003UMW63O", "B0047T74CM", "B000ALM40I", "B008XAT0TQ", "B002GHHHKG", "B009XTF8KQ", "B001OST0M6", "B009IV2Z3M", "B002ZG99KO", "B00E8G5HNM", "B0002DB5PO", "B00HOGBXS6", "B008DVJOQ4", "B004SIP92O", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00I9H3VTS", "B0011NVC98", "B001JNNDJM", "B000W1SZA4", "B00FEHCQEC", "B00AEFYYH6", "B005LAIGW8", "B00005JNNT", "B004CQZFH6", "B000U1ZV62", "B000RGN2JI", "B003L20IEW", "B00006FDBT", "B00004Y87O", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00803PFZO", "B00GOYC3I8"], "bought_together": ["B001J710Y8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001J710Y8", "B00004Z4WR", "B002TVQ48K", "B000PMFRZQ"]}, "price": 9.33, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 75218}, "asin": "B000JYW5DM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TT3AM10VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Wicker Man (Full Screen Unrated/Rated Edition)"}
{"description": "A moving and inspiring story of redemption and personal triumph in the face of great odds,Jet Li's Fearlessis the based-on-facts story of Chinese folk hero Huo Yuanjia (Jet Li). The son of a martial-arts master whose greatest strength was his restraint, Huo grows into an unbeatable fighter whose pride and thoughtlessness lead to a chain of tragic losses. After a classic wanderer-in-the-wilderness penance, Huo reinvents himself as a mature instructor of Wushu, a martial arts system that embraces all forms of fighting without preference or pre-judgement. He also becomes a populist symbol, at the dawn of the 20th century, of China's refusal to entirely capitulate to the boot of Western colonialists. Taking on whatever European, American, or Japanese fighter the outsiders bring in to demoralize the natives, Huo becomes a legend that, in real life, is still revered. Thrillingly directed by Ronny Yu (Warriors of Virtue),Jet Li&#x92;s Fearlessis a dazzling action movie that transcends its breathless fight sequences with Huo's sportsmanship virtues, i.e., knowing when you've won by example, rather than by the fist.

{"description": "Marvel Comics' armor-clad superheroIron Mangets another update in this animated feature, which incorporates much of his mythology in its energetic storyline. Here, millionaire Tony Stark (voiced by Marc Worden, who performed similar duties for Marvel'sUltimate Avengersand its sequel) is inspired to create his iconic suit after being injured at an archaeological dig in China. His heroic alter ego isn't the only thing to arise from the dig; the ancient city harbors a quartet of elemental spirits, who seek to resurrect the Mandarin and continue his reign of evil. Hardcore Marvel fans may decry some of the deviations from the originalIron Mantext (Stark's father Howard is alive and well in the feature, and the suits are already in development by the time Stark is injured), but the prevalence of numerous figures from the source material (in addition to the Mandarin, there's James Rhodes, a.k.a. War Machine, Pepper Potts, the agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Wong Chu, and glimpses of several incarnations of the Iron Man suit) and the overall vigor of the story and the quality of the 2-D and 3-D animation should please most viewers, and makes for an enjoyable alternative to the impressive 2008 live-action film. Extras include a making-of featurette which discusses Stark's 1960s origins in the comic book and the direction taken in the movie, as well as a terrific gallery of Shellhead's various suits worn throughout his storied career. A glimpse at Marvel's next animated feature--Doctor Strange--is also included. Note for parents:The Invincible Iron Mancontains some intense violence and implied nudity, so discretion should be taken before screening for very young viewers.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000CEVC9M", "B001KP2J2Q", "B000FP2YYA", "B000R5OFOA", "B002WNUVK2", "B001B1878E", "B0074JOVIW", "B004PHE9FQ", "B007549WKI", "B0036EH3XO", "B004QOB8PW", "B00280LZBI", "B00BACT1I4", "B001614E68", "B001LK8SQ6", "B000PFSYO4", "B002FGUHBE", "B003XL6EJY", "B0007US7CQ", "B003XTUAHS", "B004MYYHG8", "B000PE0G0A", "B003UN2ICM", "B00DYV1ROK", "B004MYYHGI", "B0055CP9HC", "B005SH63HO", "B003ITZBVS", "B002YOKVUY", "B003Z8ZCDO", "B004EE2ZY2", "B00HXH00YE", "B0001I55N8", "B00F6W6PY2", "B000NY0YJK", "B000A9QKLO", "B00A8GBVOK", "B0009UZG28", "B00HXH0102", "B00368PSIM", "B004I1KZTI", "B005BXY1PG", "B00GJ6HQDI", "B00D97DLYS", "B000A59PLU", "B008FYZHLK", "B0000VCZLG", "B005CSYQ2S", "B007IKKSNY", "B00AWHDFHQ", "B000KJTFEI", "B00BBAQD6S", "B00465I19C", "B00CENSU1W", "B00B9LNPUQ", "B00157OI9Q", "B000F4RH8O", "B004EPZ07K", "B00HMOWA0A", "B00GZ0ML2Y", "B005BXY1RE", "B00E5I2MCM", "B007MCUAD6", "B004NJC0IE", "B0002MFGE6", "B003YOZNBU", "B00FM4S7KO", "B000LE17A2", "B00JPS7HOA", "B007549XLG", "B00E4Q6UVY", "B002FOFX7O", "B0000633UA", "B004RBC5LA", "B0036EH3XY", "B003NHMYJ2", "B0001Z4P3M", "B00F4FFO8E", "B00HRUQ8S4", "B006UKX5V0", "B002DYKPF6", "B00D9LWJHE", "B0081BEZXS", "B000A9QKL4", "B000OPODNG", "B00023E88U", "B004LWZWFQ", "B0002MFG0K", "1608872750", "B008JFUO72", "B007ILZAA4", "B0018BDDFE", "B00GZ0ML4C", "B008JFUS0U", "B00HMOW9YM", "B000LC4ZB2", "B000RPOCIY", "B002XJDUVM", "B002DYKPFQ", "B00FA97P2W"], "bought_together": ["B000CEVC9M", "B000FP2YYA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001KP2J2Q", "B000CEVC9M", "B002WNUVK2", "B0074JOVIW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 63478}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "Lionsgate", "asin": "B000K7UBTI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51yZwfOCzpL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Invincible Iron Man"}
{"description": "What Agatha Christie did for genteel spinsters with her intrepid crime-solver Miss Marple, G.K. Chesterton did with the splendid Father Brown, a bumbling yet wily cleric in 1920s England, bumping into and then solving the most outlandish crimes. This boxed set includes seven full-length episodes ofFather Brown(shown in the U.S. on PBS) in all his twinkly, slightly clueless glory.The Curse of the Golden Crossis a particular gem, ambitious in its story of an American archeologist who receives eerie death threats from a hidden competitor (or is it a ghost?) upon his discovery of an important ancient cross. As the archeologist returns to England to view what is reportedly a second, heretofore unknown cross, dug up at a country church, an upper crust entourage gathers 'round him--and Father Brown, of course--as he makes his way to the site. \"A curse! How splendid!\" says one aging flapper upon learning that the newest find may have crossed the gods in an irrevocable way. Despite the varying production values (the show switches from film for outdoor shots to video for indoors), the intricate plots (mistaken identities, hidden adultery, faked suicides) make for a very satisfying armchair detective experience. Spot on, this.--A.T.

{"description": "A comedy with serious intentions,Man of the Yearattempts to challenge the audience's notions of what is and isn't real when it comes to politics. Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams) is a popular political talk show host. As a lark, he runs for president and wins. The thing is, he's not any more unqualified than the other candidates, so his victory doesn't seem quite so outrageous.  But when it turns out that the computer ballot firm responsible for tallying all the votes may have had a glitch--and that a recount would negate his win--mayhem ensues and the film segues from comedy, to drama, and back to comedy (sort of) again. Directed by Barry Levinson (Diner,Wag the Dog), the film doesn't take advantage of Williams' natural humor or charm. He at times appears to be chomping at the bit to unleash a comedic tirade or two, only to be held back by stiff lines. Williams only truly appears to be enjoying himself when trading lines with Laura Linney, who portrays the hapless do-gooder at the ballot firm who's being set up to appear unreliable. With some fine performances by a supporting cast that includes Jeff Goldblum, Lewis Black, and the inimitable Christopher Walken,Man of the Yearoccasionally hints at greatness. But at best, it's a lukewarm comedy with a diluted message.--Jae-Ha Kim", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00079HZOS", "B001ILFUBE", "B0036VHJ5Y", "B002PI1NRO", "0780622561", "B00000IQV7", "B00005JPQE", "B004GJYRKK", "6305297142", "0790731460", "B00007976U", "630587493X", "B0043X1FL8", "6305428441", "B001ECDVJU", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000FDEVA2", "0783227973", "B000B8QG22", "B003LR5BD0", "B00008L3U1", "B000MXPE7O", "B00005JKBC", "B00133KFGW", "B001TH92N4", "B004SUDQB8", "B000077VQ6", "B002AS464Q", "B000CEV3M8", "B000N4RAR4", "B002NZK5UU", "B00005V9HT", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00AEBB9SM", "B005XB8SHI", "B00006ADFN", "6305144168", "B00AEFY74G", "B00008979G", "B000W1V5VU", "B000059TG6", "B008XAT0VO", "B0013XZ2QK", "B003ASLJQI", "B000FKP3XY", "B0001FGBUW", "B000CEXEWA", "B00020HAXI", "B00007GZR5", "B000BYA4IS", "0783227396", "B000RJO56E", "B000RETOGU", "B0000633R5", "B00275EGWY", "B000031EGV", "B00005JLSB", "B00015YVDG", "B000FVQLLQ", "B00AEBB9WI", "B00008MTVY", "B000P0J0BK", "B000067J1Y", "B000ARFPNK", "B000BITVA6", "B00097DY0M", "B001GCUO02", "B000N3SRO0", "B00005JM20", "B00BEIYKX0", "B001AZIRYA", "B001BL96JI", "B007L6VRHG", "B00008DDXA", "B002NZK5QO", "B000XJD33O", "B00005JND5", "B00004XPPB", "B000SFOW8I", "B0043X1FM2", "076780676X", "B001ECDVK4", "B001QE99AQ", "B000TZX5XK", "B001NFNFNU", "6305213283", "B000YAF4MA", "B00803PFXG", "B001TUZD8O", "B000M9CB4W", "B00005V4XW", "B00005JKIS", "B000H0MKOC", "B003Q6D2B4", "B000RETOH4", "B002ZG998G", "B004SUDQ2W", "B0002I837M", "B003AWRM9W", "B00096S4DK"], "bought_together": ["B00000IQV7"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0043X1FL8", "B0036VHJ5Y", "B0034GK78W", "0780622561"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 103853}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.97, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B000LC5B7O", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y5NvZAJqL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Man of the Year (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "If the first five years were about raising a family,Full House's sixth was about learning to let go. In season opener \"Come Fly with Me,\" 15-year-old D.J. (Candace Cameron) introduces her first boyfriend, Steve (new cast member Scott Weinger), to the rest of the gang (the two got together during a summer program in Spain). Danny (Bob Saget) doesn't think she's ready for a relationship, but maybe he's just jealous since his long-distance love, Vicky (Gail Edwards), remains in Colorado. Meanwhile, Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen) bids goodbye to her best friend, Teddy (Tahj Mowry), when his family moves from California to Texas. While there are no marriages or births this time around, other changes are afoot. While Jesse (John Stamos), frontman for the Rippers, still struggles for recognition in the States, he becomes a star in Japan (\"Road to Tokyo\"). Closer to home, he joins forces with Joey (Dave Coulier). This time, instead of advertising, they collaborate on a radio show (\"Radio Days\"). As for Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin), she helps a classmate out of a jam (\"Silence Is Not Golden\"). Meanwhile, toddling twins Nicky and Alex (Blake and Dylan Tuomy-Wilhoit) continue to provide the cuteness factor Michelle monopolized in the early days.Also in year six,Full Housefinally casts off those overused catch phrases, like \"You got it, dude!\" and \"How rude!\" (Though Jesse still exclaims \"Have mercy!\" on occasion.) Guest stars include Mark Linn-Baker (Perfect Strangers) as Becky's cousin (\"Trouble in Twin Town\") and MTV VJ Martha Quinn as Jesse and Joey's boss (\"Designing Mothers\" and \"The Dating Game\"). The season ends with a Tannerino trip to Disney World in fan favorite \"The House Meets the Mouse.\"--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Flushed Awayis a rip-roaring nautical adventure with a twist: The heroes are a pair of rodents braving the sewers underneath London. Roddy (voiced by Hugh Jackman) is an upper-crust house-mouse who finds himself flushed into the subterranean sewers. Eager to return to his posh home, he enlists the help of a boat-captain rat named Rita (Kate Winslet), who has troubles of her own; namely the kingpin of the underworld, the Toad (Ian McKellen), and his henchmen including the French mercenary Le Frog (Jean Reno).While technicallyFlushed Awaycould be considered part of the wave of celebrity-voiced, anthropomorphic-animal movies that hit in 2005-2006 (Madagascar,Over the Hedge,The Wild, etc.), it doesn't inspire the same sense of d&#xE9;j&#xE0; vu. For one thing, its voice actors are less recognizable than the likes of Bruce Willis and Chris Rock. For another, its look is very distinctive. Like Nick Park'sChicken RunandWallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, it's a joint production of DreamWorks Animation and Aardman Features, and although Park isn't involved, it retains his trademark blocky look of clay animation. But animating the movie by computer rather than by hand allows for some eye-popping tableaux, such as floodwaters rushing through the sewers and an entire town of little animated characters. It's a crazy thrill ride loaded with inside jokes and enough crude humor to earn a PG rating, and the band of singing slugs is also a hoot.--David HoriuchiOn the DVDIt's no surprise that the singing slugs are the stars of the DVD's bonus features. They're featured in two music videos (less than a minute total), and in a 13-minute segment an Aardman animator builds a slug out of plasticine.  (In contrast, the lesson on drawing Roddy is a mere two minutes.) A song jukebox jumps to 10 musical points in the film, though the non-slug background music isn't really worth the jump. On the human side, there are eight-minute featurettes on the music and the voices, a set-top game that is easier to control than most such featurettes (and easier to beat too), and a commentary track by directors David Bowers and Sam Fell in which they have a grand old time remembering their inside jokes and showering love on the Spike and Whitey characters. The DVD-ROM has access to 21 more online games.--David HoriuchiFun Facts fromFlushed AwayIn Tabitha's room, there are a variety of dolls from previous DreamWorks Animation films, including a Gromit and several bunnies fromWallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,an Alex the Lion fromMadagascar,and a Dragon fromShrek.Many characters from past films make cameos inFlushed Away.For example, aChicken Runchicken is on the second page of the Toad&#x92;s scrapbook, Gromit&#x92;s head is a pencil top in the Jammy Dodger, the penguin fromWallace and Gromit: The Wrong Trousersis on a stamp on the Jammy Dodger, and a poster ofWallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbitis on the side of a bus in Kensington.There are officially 60 million rats in the UK.  That&#x92;s one rat for every person.The various boats in the film are made up of flotsam and jetsam that rats could conceivably find in the sewer.For the double decker bus:Ice chest, retro flipping numbers alarm clock, bike lamp, buckle, oil drum, soup can, license plate, rope, plastic suitcase, jerry can.For the mini cooper: Soda can, battery,  sardine can, butter knife, old lights.Simulating the toilet water and making it look realistic proved to be a challenge.  After much consideration, it was finally discovered that what was missing was caustics, or the use of light reflection off the bottom of the bowl.  This was added and everyone was happy because they could finally get their mind out of the toilet.Stills fromFlushed Away(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0012EM5D8", "B0006JMLRK", "B00003CXJ4", "B00005JNQS", "B002WJI2QQ", "B001DPHDCY", "B001U3D88M", "B0000640SC", "B000H7JCK0", "B00CWM58WY", "B004HO6I4M", "B005SDUV4E", "0783231474", "B001PR0YEE", "B004EPZ034", "B001GCUO7A", "B000RMJ4F8", "B0006UEVT0", "B001LPWGFA", "B000CZ0PT4", "B00029LO0Y", "B000BITUVG", "B000MV9026", "B000ION23A", "B000L22SG6", "B000UVKGPI", "B004AKCME8", "B000DWMYQ8", "B000065V42", "B000MNOX9E", "B000EQ5UHS", "6305161887", "B003UESJF6", "B001ECQ75A", "B000UFIYOO", "B005LAIISA", "B00B7EQPNE", "B00CHVJODE", "B001FTIJS0", "B0000AOX0O", "B002ZG97YM", "B007FF3HQM", "B00003CXG7", "B00E00OGE2", "B004SIPAFK", "B001LXIDTA", "B006JD48LO", "B00E9ZATJO", "B005LAIIT4", "B009AMAH3O", "B00000JL8E", "B00000JGOQ", "B0000VV4W2", "B003E66Y84", "B00EBBGLFC", "B004LWZW7Y", "B001OMU6UM", "B00005JM7T", "B002UOMH00", "B008JFUQ16", "0783219806", "B000IFRT2O", "B005QODEEE", "B001HN6918", "B00007LVCM", "B000GUJZ00", "B00HLTD2OE", "B00005JMFH", "B001NCDFTW", "B001GCUNWQ", "B000G75AZC", "B00JK531ES", "B005LAIIHG", "B0046A9RMM", "B000AY74OG", "B008R65XPQ", "B001NLJ3RG", "B00009YXAW", "B00GRZPQCO", "B001RXDM36", "B0034G4P26", "B004OWQTZ0", "B0052XI5J8", "B0034G4OYA", "B0044RFTCO", "B006VUYJ00", "B001LXIDTK", "B008NNY9QW", "B00LG6YEKE", "B00028HBES", "B000P0J09W", "B000VBJEEG", "B00I6JOD2S", "B0039N74CW", "B00ALMNCLQ", "B001SXZ7T2", "B00CWM5MDY", "B000ROAK2W", "B00AEBB8KQ"], "bought_together": ["B004HO6I4M", "B00CWM58WY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002WJI2QQ", "B004HO6I4M", "B00CWM58WY", "B00003CXJ4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5311}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.85, "brand": "Dreamworks", "asin": "B000M343BC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PGB5ZeCfL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Flushed Away (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Brilliantly conceived, superbly directed, and beautifully acted,Babelis inarguably one of the best films of 2006. Director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and his co-writer, Guillermo Arriaga (the two also collaborated onAmores Perrosand21 Grams) weave together the disparate strands of their story into a finely hewn fabric by focusing on what appear to be several equally incongruent characters: an American (Brad Pitt) touring Morocco with his wife (Cate Blanchett) become the focus of an international incident also involving a hardscrabble Moroccan farmer (Mustapha Rachidi) struggling to keep his two young sons in line and his family together. A San Diego nanny (Adriana Barraza), her employers absent, makes the disastrous decision to take their kids with her to a wedding in Mexico. And a deaf-mute Japanese teen (the extraordinary Rinko Kikuchi) deals with a relationship with her father (Koji Yakusho) and the world in general that's been upended by the death of her mother. It is perhaps not surprising, or particularly original, that a gun is the device that ties these people together. YetBabelisn't merely about violence and its tragic consequences. It's about communication, and especially the lack of it--both intercultural, raising issues like terrorism and immigration, and intracultural, as basic as husbands talking to their wives and parents understanding their children. I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's command of his medium, sound and visual alike, is extraordinary; the camera work is by turns kinetic and restrained, the music always well matched to the scenes, the editing deft but not confusing, and the film (which clocks in at a lengthy 143 minutes) is filled with indelible moments. Many of those moments are also pretty stark and grim, and no will claim that all of this leads to a \"happy\" ending, but there is a sense of reconciliation, perhaps even resolution. \"If You Want to be Understood... Listen,\" goes the tagline. And if you want a movie that will leave you thinking,Babelis it.--Sam GrahamBeyondBabelOther Interweaving Storylines on DVDOther DVDs by Director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rrituWhy We Love Cate BlanchettStills fromBabel(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001CNRRU", "B00005N8A9", "B0041KKYF6", "B000A3XY5A", "B000F7CMRM", "B000067IZ3", "B00005JL57", "B00AEFXESQ", "B001P9KR8U", "B000N6TX1I", "B001JIE7JC", "B00005JPKE", "B00AEFXQ9S", "B00005JMJ4", "B0010DR4BO", "B000NIVJF4", "B000NIVJFY", "B000F1IQN2", "B00HF98SPS", "B0045ZAQRS", "B00011CZRE", "B000N3T0DW", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B000MZHW40", "B004SIP6VI", "B0034G4P30", "B008JFUNKU", "B003ASLJQS", "B000E1NXJ0", "B004SIP6GI", "B00AEBB89W", "B00275EGWY", "B000IONJM4", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00003CWTI", "B00080Z53O", "B00005JNCZ", "B00114XTHA", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00112S8RS", "B001PPLJIQ", "B000MXPE7O", "B00102F5WK", "B00121QGPY", "B0016Q2D66", "B002J1RZHE", "B008220DGE", "B000O76ZQC", "B0013XZ6X4", "B00080ZG10", "B00337KM2S", "B000286RP2", "B004SIP8ZM", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005JMJG", "B00005Q4CS", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B0036TGSJE", "B001TOD92C", "B000OY8NBK", "B004XVMCKS", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B00005JLRE", "B00005JH9M", "B00004WG2F", "B00AEBB8SS", "B00005JKJA", "B00H9HZITU", "B000YENUI6", "B0041KKYDI", "B001MZ5W3M", "B000N3SU92", "B000EQHXNW", "B0041KKYEM", "B001LLH8SE", "B0007TKOAA", "B000P0J0BK", "B002S5N052", "B004SIP7S0", "B00AEBB8NI", "B002SJIO4A", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B000E33VWW", "B000M341QE", "B002VWNICC", "B001NFNFNU", "6305313687", "B00005JKTF", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B00008K7AO", "B00DL48BM6", "079073639X", "B00H83EUQW", "B000FVQLRA", "B0002TT0MI", "B00AHTYI5M", "B00H9L26AA", "B00003CWRX", "B002FHGESI"], "bought_together": ["B00005N8A9", "B0041KKYF6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000A3XY5A", "B0001CNRRU", "B0041KKYF6", "B00G4Q3KOC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 100262}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.22, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B000MCH5P4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51poif023LL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Babel"}

{"description": "It takes a certain kind of comic genius to create a character who is, to quote the classic Sondheim lyric, appealing and appalling. But be forewarned:Boratis not \"something for everyone.\" It arrives as advertised as one of the most outrageous, most offensive, and funniest films in years. Kazakhstan journalist Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen reprising the popular character from hisDa Ali G Show), leaves his humble village to come to \"U.S. and A\" to film a documentary. After catching an episode ofBaywatchin his New York hotel room, he impulsively scuttles his plans and, accompanied by his fat,hirsute producer (Hardy to his Laurel), proceeds to California to pursue the object of his obsession, Pamela Anderson.Boratis not about how he finds America; it's about how America finds him in a series of increasingly cringe-worthy scenes. Borat, with his '70s mustache, well-worn grey suit, and outrageously backwards attitudes (especially where Jews are concerned) interacts with a cross-section of the populace, catching them, a la Alan Funt onCandid Camera, in the act of being themselves. Early on, an unwitting humor coach advises Borat about various types of jokes. Borat asks if his brother's retardation is a ripe subject for comedy. The coach patiently replies, \"That would not be funny in America.\" NOT! Borat is subversively, bracingly funny. When it comes to exploring uncharted territory of what is and is not appropriate or politically correct, Borat knows no boundaries, as when he brings a fancy dinner with the southern gentry to a halt after returning from the bathroom with a bag of his feces (\"The cultural differences are vast,\" his hostess graciously/patronizingly offers), or turns cheers to boos at a rodeo when he calls for bloodlust against the Iraqis and mangles \"The Star Spangled Banner.\"Success, John F. Kennedy once said, has a thousand fathers. A paternity test onBoratmight reveal traces of Bill Dana's Jose Jimenez, Andy Kaufman, Michael Moore,The Jamie Kennedy Xperiment, andJackass. Some scenes seem to have been staged (a game Anderson, whom Borat confronts at a book signing, was reportedly in on the setup), but others, as the growing litany of lawsuits attests, were not. All too real is Borat's encounter with loutish Southern frat boys who reveal their sexism and racism, and the disturbing moment when he asks a gun store owner what gun he would recommend to \"kill a Jew\" (a Glock automatic is the matter-of-fact reply). Comedy is not pretty, and inBoratit can get downright ugly, as when Borat and his producer get jiggly with it during a nude fight that spills out from their hotel room into the hallway, elevator, lobby and finally, a mortgage brokers association banquet. High-five! --Donald LiebensonOn the DVD\"Global Visitings\" capturesBorat-mania in all its hype and glory, as Sacha Baron Cohen, never breaking character, promotes his film around the world. On the itinerary isLate Night with Conan O'Brienand the Toronto Film Festival, a now-legendary screening aborted after a projector malfunction. A mixed bag of deleted scenes finds Borat trying to bait more unsuspecting citizens, including an animal-control worker who refuses Borat a dog after he asks, \"How do you recommend I cook this?\" and a doctor who is nonplussed by Borat's obscene medical history. A supermarket visit offers the most maddening fromage-inspired looniness since Monty Python's \"Cheese Shop\" sketch. Also good for a few chuckles are a faux soundtrack commercial and aBaywatchparody (\"Sexydangerwatch\").--Donald LiebensonBeyondBoratAll things Sacha Baron CohenBoratApparelBoratSoundtrackStills fromBorat(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002P7UCJ0", "B005LAIHGI", "B0002ZMITY", "B002OID4WM", "B00020X852", "B000A88ESW", "B000WZEZGI", "B001G5T6GW", "B005LAIHHC", "B00AEFZ8OY", "B002P7UCJA", "B00005JNZU", "B001DPHDB0", "B001J9KJ4I", "B00G2P79BU", "B000J4QW8Q", "B00AEFYS2M", "B00005JMYI", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B0006GANPA", "B001OD4S50", "6305922756", "B003XJABTK", "B00AEBBA2C", "B008R65XNS", "B000BKVQS4", "B00AEBB9K0", "B003CRM6PA", "B000A7DVR2", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B0016MOV92", "B000BKJ762", "B00009W5CA", "B000AP04L0", "B008220BGQ", "B002T9H2LA", "B00068WOH8", "0385523467", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00008975Z", "B004SIP95G", "B00003CXZ1", "0783229526", "B002ZG99N6", "B003VPX5Y4", "B002SJIO4A", "B00005JLQN", "B00AEFY854", "B00005O3VC", "B004XVMCH6", "B000K7VHQE", "B0006HBZEW", "B00005JMUA", "B000VE439Y", "B00AEFXDO6", "B000EMGJAO", "B0000A02TZ", "B00005JNBQ", "B003Y5H5B0", "B00BEIYMZ6", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000MCH5RM", "B000K7VHOG", "B00005ALS0", "B001UV4X8S", "B00009MGEM", "B0001Z4OXS", "B000C20VPA", "B0012IWNZY", "B00CE00ZV8", "B00005QCVX", "B000I0RNVQ", "B000022TSW", "B001TOD92C", "B000P0J09M", "B00005JL78", "B00AEFYAMA", "B00AEFXGIY", "B000J4P9P8", "B000055Y0X", "B004EPZ084", "B001VLBDD0", "B00AEFY5B6", "B006XZWAWM", "B00005JKMN", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000XFVIOO", "B002GSXKOW", "B00006G8HR", "B000HT386M", "B000MQCUJG", "B00007AJF7", "B00005KA6V", "B004SIP9MY", "B00AEBBA72", "B00018D42W", "B000TZJBPQ", "B0009HBPN0", "B004P9UWM8"], "bought_together": ["B005LAIHGI", "B002P7UCJ0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005LAIHGI", "B000WZEZGI", "B002OID4WM", "B000TZJBPQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15271}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.29, "brand": "COHEN,SACHA BARON", "asin": "B000MMMT9G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51uGbGa68JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"}
