{"description": "Anybody who has written him off because of his string of stinkers--or anybody who's too young to rememberThe Goodbye Girl--may be shocked at the accomplishment and nuance of Richard Dreyfuss's performance inClose Encounters of the Third Kind. Here, he plays a man possessed; contacted by aliens, he (along with other members of the \"chosen\") is drawn toward the site of the incipient landing: Devil's Tower, in rural Wyoming. As in many Spielberg films, there are no personalized enemies; the struggle is between those who have been called and a scientific establishment that seeks to protect them by keeping them away from the arriving spacecraft. The ship, and the special effects in general, are every bit as jaw-dropping on the small screen as they were in the theater (well, almost). Released in 1977 as a cerebral alternative to the swashbuckling science fiction epics then in vogue,Close Encountersnow seems almost wholesome in its representation of alien contact and interested less in philosophizing about extraterrestrials than it is in examining the nature of the inner \"call.\" Ultimately a motion picture about the obsession of the driven artist or determined visionary,Close Encounterscomes complete with the stock Spielberg wives and girlfriends who seek to tether the dreamy, possessed protagonists to the more mundane concerns of the everyday. So a spectacular, seminal motion picture indeed, but one with gender politics that are all too terrestrial.--Miles Bethany", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304143184", "0783231482", "6300182355", "6303506291", "6303212263", "B00005B238", "6300214060", "0790736233", "0783216084", "6303148352", "B00006AL1C", "6300268993", "6304508611", "0767825411", "6300183971", "6304509154", "6301300556", "6301670124", "6305363668", "B0000A36J1", "B000059HFB", "6300181286", "6300247236", "B00004RV8M", "B0000048TX", "B00000JQSV", "B00000JXVM", "B00000JGEK"], "bought_together": ["6304143184"], "also_viewed": ["B0087F7VSY", "6304143184", "6301792734", "B00000ILE6", "0783226152", "6301966732", "B00BBND56G"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 557907}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "", "asin": "076780192X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511NY005RKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Close Encounters of the Third Kind (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}
{"description": "For all of its conventional plotting about an obsessive-compulsive curmudgeon (Jack Nicholson) who improves his personality at the urging of his gay neighbor (Greg Kinnear) and a waitress (Helen Hunt) who inspires his best behavior, this is one of the sharpest Hollywood comedies of the 1990s. Nicholson could play his role in his sleep (the Oscar he won should have gone to Robert Duvall forThe Apostle), but his mischievous persona is precisely necessary to give heart to his seemingly heartless character, who is of all things a successful romance novelist. As a single mom with a chronically asthmatic young son, Hunt gives the film its conscience and integrity (along with plenty of wry humor), and she also won an Oscar for her wonderful performance. Greg Kinnear had to settle for an Oscar nomination (while cowriter-director James L. Brooks was inexplicably snubbed by Oscar that year), but his work was also singled out in the film's near-unanimous chorus of critical praise. It's questionable whether a romance between Hunt and the much older Nicholson is entirely believable, but this movie's smart enough--and charmingly funny enough--to make it seem endearingly possible.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001AVZA8", "B000YAF4MA", "0800141741", "B004FQX5B6", "B0000YEEGM", "B0038N9WKU", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00AEBB9WI", "B00005JLSK", "0783226845", "B0000AOV4I", "B000YDBPAM", "B000XJD33O", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00081U7HC", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00003CXFV", "B001ECDVK4", "6305212112", "B000EHRVOW", "B00009Y3PV", "6304765266", "B00004RJ73", "B005F2JRUC", "0783225733", "B00AEFXYOA", "6305236569", "B000OCZA04", "B000FFJYBG", "B003ASLJK4", "0792833198", "B000JYW5B4", "B00012QLB4", "B00BTYRB3U", "B0043X1FL8", "B000055Y0Y", "B00005B6JZ", "B000EHQU0S", "B00AEBB9UK", "B00008G7UF", "B0002B15ZG", "B00005JG6N", "B001MBTTNA", "B001ECDVJU", "B00003CWQR", "B00AEFY4CG", "630471193X", "B002GHHHP6", "B00AEBB9NM", "B0000A02TZ", "0767821769", "B00569I5BQ", "B00AEFYSWM", "B00AEFXYJA", "B000XT1P3E", "B002GHHHGU", "B00026ZG10", "6305128952", "B00005OLYF", "B001LMAK9W", "B000N6U0E2", "B000EMGJ7C", "B000023VTP", "B00CPTUOI2", "B004SIP9U6", "B00001ZWUS", "B003BV8ICC", "B0043X1FM2", "B0013XZ2QK", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00AEBB9FA", "B007SPPANM", "B00005JM4Q", "B007N31YH0", "B000VECAD0", "B00003CXO1", "B00009WVSL", "B00003CXSM", "B000NA1WDQ", "B00004BZIY", "B002AS464Q", "B000J103OI", "B000021Y7L", "B000ENC5YW", "B0002V7ON8", "B00009W5CA", "B00015YVDG", "B0009X75O2", "B0000JBALO", "0767803434", "6305065551", "B000MQC9H4", "6305692572", "B00013RC2U", "6305144168", "B00008979G", "B000CCBCAS", "0792846443", "B000M341QE"], "bought_together": ["B0001AVZA8", "B000YAF4MA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001AVZA8", "B0038N9WKU", "B000YAF4MA", "B00013WWT8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5469}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.96, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "0767811100", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KRRMHSAJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "As Good As It Gets"}
{"description": "Nominated for seven Academy Awards&#xAE; in 1954, including Best Picture and Best Actor, THE CAINE MUTINY is a classic film about the unstable Captain Queeg (Humphrey Bogart) and his tumultuous command of an old minesweeper and her weary crew. On the high seas during the dramatic battles of World War II, Queeg&#x2019;s by-the-book approach pushes his crew and his popular second-in-command, Lt. Maryk (Van Johnson), to the breaking point. After a series of questionable orders, Maryk confronts Queeg when he orders the ship directly into the path of a deadly typhoon. Maryk invokes naval code and relieves Queeg of his command, forcing the crew to mutiny. Once safely back in port, Maryk is court-martialed for treason, setting off a tense trial that exposes the true state of Queeg&#x2019;s mind.

{"description": "From the sun-dappled heartland, a young man (Robert Redford, in soft lighting) emerges as maybe the best baseball player anybody's ever seen. On his way to the majors, he is cut down by an enigmatic black widow (Barbara Hershey) and vanishes for many years. When he reemerges, a silent mystery, he lands a spot with the New York team and begins tearing up the league--he's still the natural. Fans of the Bernard Malamud novel will be dismayed at the pure mythical hokum of this film, but baseball fanatics have been known to watch and rewatch this one; after all, it's constructed as a kind of shrine to the national pastime. Barry Levinson (Rain Man) directs the movie with an unabashed devotion to the game, although the film could use more of the realities of chewing tobacco and pine tar. Redford is fine, and Kim Basinger and Oscar-nominated Glenn Close are effective as the women in his life. The crowning touch is the soaring, extraordinary music by Randy Newman, the singer-songwriter turned orchestral composer.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005M20M", "0783235968", "B000068NNT", "630273973X", "6302534372", "6302415853", "6305132666", "0800121600", "6304291698", "B00004RGUU", "6305126062", "630596260X", "B0000399WO", "6301734734", "6303597874", "6302936381", "B00000I1DI", "6303014100", "076780922X", "B0000048ZL", "6300181472", "0792841786", "0790743159", "0792839846", "5559477621", "6302226899", "6302450179", "6302023742", "B0000068ZQ", "630018224X", "6300183513", "630299005X", "B00004RFFA", "B0000068EE", "630150528X", "6300246965", "B00000JGEI", "B000M5BRX2", "6300215695", "6302360978", "6302909023", "6300181154", "6300184927", "0800179552"], "bought_together": ["B00005M20M", "0783235968"], "also_viewed": ["0783235968", "B000003KMM", "B0000399WO", "6300216810"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 348212}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.79, "brand": "", "asin": "0767809262", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51816SHE4HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Natural [VHS]"}
{"description": "Spencer Tracy's last performance was in this well-meaning, handsome film by Stanley Kramer about a pair of white parents (Tracy and Katharine Hepburn) trying to make sense of their daughter's impending marriage to an African American doctor (Sidney Poitier). The film has been knocked over the years for padding conflict and stoking easy liberalism by making Poitier's character in every socioeconomic sense a good catch: But what if Kramer had made this stranger a factory worker? Would the audience still find it as easy to accept a mixed-race relationship? But there's no denying the drawing power of this movie, which gets most of its integrity from the stirring performances of Tracy and Hepburn.

{"description": "Call it \"Desperate Movie,\" because this ludicrous thriller deteriorates into unintentional comedy. For reasons that are never explained, a sociopathic killer (Michael Keaton) is the only available bone marrow donor for the cancer-stricken son of a San Francisco cop (Andy Garcia), who must capture the killer alive after a laughable escape in a labyrinthine hospital. The ensuing manhunt relies on plentiful plot holes and ridiculous shortcuts (like Keaton's use of a surgical laser to cut leg irons, or accessing hospital schematics from a prison computer). Self-consciously shot in film noir style, the cat-and-mouse routine leads to a briefly impressive car chase, but the premise (which even the movie's original press notes described as \"intriguing, if unlikely\") is based on \"moral ambiguity\" that doesn't translate from script to screen. Instead of forcing Keaton's typically \"sick genius\" to prove his ingenuity, the film pits him against a squad of cops who couldn't find a beer in a crowded pub.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00002E23C", "6305310335", "B00AEFYD9K", "B00008977C", "B00005JNNT", "B00000F5MN", "B000U1ZV76", "0767806808", "B00000IQC9", "B00008NFR3", "0767807588", "B00AEFXKZ8", "6305692572", "B0001932ZK", "B00009AOAZ", "0767810872", "0792844866", "B00007AJE1", "0783226888", "0783219571", "6305213305", "B00096S49Y", "B00029RT9E", "B000F6ZIII", "B00015YVDG", "B00008L3S6", "B000LBL3TK", "B002NZK5RI", "B003L20IG0", "B002KGVB7S", "B000N4RASS", "B004GJYRK0", "B00AEFXIIW", "B00005Y1UV", "B000C3L2PC", "B002AT8K9W", "B001KRVLCI", "B00005UQ9T", "0790736411", "0792833848", "B00JL6L4UY", "B000PISZ7W", "6305162026", "B00005QAOZ", "B0006D3HGA", "B000EU1ONS", "B000087F7R", "B002AT8KAG", "B007WZPQO6", "0783222149", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B000R4SMCW", "B00JDCP0QA", "6305308837", "B003AWRMA6", "B000NTMA0Q", "0790732149", "B003ASLJIQ", "B00004STDN", "B002LK3DZQ", "B000MEYKEG", "0767809726", "B0036TGT8Y", "B000B8GT92", "6304806434", "B00AEBB9NM", "B0045HCJFS", "6304602944", "B00005R5GA", "B004BSWC8A", "B002O3Z4WK", "B0000399WA", "B001R3YRG2", "B00003CXKA", "B00AEFYF2K", "0792844874", "B002ZG98SW", "B004SIP9CO", "B0001FGBWK", "630523650X", "B0045O2PHS", "B000P0J06K", "B001M9ELQC", "B00BGI07GC", "B000I2J736", "B001CW8016", "B00HLTD49C", "B003AWRM9M", "B000CBCWRG", "B000EQ5SRK", "6304765258", "B00008977A", "B001U0HB5Q", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B000F6ZIIS", "0783229402", "B00AEBB8O2", "B00CX7TOOG", "B000055Y0Y"], "bought_together": ["B00002E23C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0783219571", "B000PISZ7W", "B00AEFYD9K", "B0001932ZK"]}, "price": 19.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 134257}, "asin": "0767812743", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519STKWW5QL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Desperate Measures"}

{"description": "ComparingGodspellto its near-contemporariesJesus Christ  SuperstarandHairis unavoidable, butGodspellhas developed its own unique following. With their thrift-store-meets-circus-performer garb, the characters in David Greene's adaptation of the popular off-Broadway production may look more like the hippies inHairthan the biblical personages ofSuperstar. ButGodspellisn't really about the \"Age of Aquarius,\" nor does it adopt a dark or operatic tone towards its subject matter, the Gospel according to Matthew. The mood is, instead, upbeat and uplifting (at least until the crucifixion sequence).The film opens with youthful city dwellers from various walks of life dropping their activities to follow John the Baptist (David Haskell from the original New York production). They sing (\"Prepare Ye the Way of the Lord\") as he leads them into a fountain where they are (metaphorically) baptized. There they meet Jesus (Victor Garber). Frizzy hair and mime makeup aside, the handsome young Garber (Titanic,Annie) is convincing in his film debut. Once baptized, they follow him around various scenic New York locations, singing and acting out passages from the Scriptures.The largely unknown cast is talented and charismatic, but the film is only fitfully engaging on an emotional level because only Jesus, John, and Judas (Haskell again) emerge as distinct characters. Stephen Schwartz's pleasingpop-rock score, however, helps to smooth over the rough spots, and Robin Lamont's hit version of \"Day by Day\" remains a highlight.--Kathleen C.

(That plot point alone should warn you thatPoison Ivy 2bears, at best, a distant resemblance to the original, and more's the pity.) Inspired by Ivy's \"philosophy\" of pushing all boundaries, Lily decides to explore the dark side of herself, which basically boils down to her chasing after a petulant, self-absorbed sculptor (Johnathon Schaech) and in turn being chased by her leacherous, self-absorbed art teacher. The point of movies likeIvy 2is to have some fun, a few thrills, and we're done, thank you very much. But the filmmakers felt obliged to lard this thing up with ponderous pretension and Artistic Angst. The result is sort of a cross betweenBikini Med SchoolandLa Notte, with a happy ending tacked on. Bleh.

{"description": "First broadcast on HBO in June of 1998--shortly before the theatrical release of Steven Spielberg'sSaving Private Ryan--this World War II drama offers an equally intimate and devastating study of combat and its tragic aftermath. Set in Germany during the closing days of the war, the film uses a little-known episode of U.S. military history--the bloody battle of the Hurtigen Forest--as the backdrop for the story of a battle-weary private (Ron Eldard) who is the only surviving member of his platoon. Despite his request for dismissal on the grounds of mental disability and shell-shock, he is considered a promising soldier by his superiors, promoted to sergeant, and assigned to command a fresh platoon of young, inexperienced soldiers. The cycle of war continues, and the film ends as it began--with one soldier carrying a mortally wounded comrade from a scene of devastating loss. A veteran of several war films, director John Irvin emphasizes the gritty, physically exhausting realities of combat with keen attention to detail on location in Hungary. This film is decidedly downbeat (don't look for any Spielbergian uplift here), but its depiction of warfare is undeniably powerful, earning praise for Irvin and HBO for tackling such an uncompromising project.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["1564080242", "6302224330"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 446559}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0783112750", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N4DD2MXAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "When Trumpets Fade [VHS]"}

{"description": "Meryl Streep tried her hand at action films with this Curtis Hanson film and proved herself quite credible, bringing emotion as well as the willingness to kick butt. She plays a suburban mom and former white-water rafting guide who is taking her family on a raft trip for summer vacation.

{"description": "The best way to enjoy this 1997 thriller is to forget the much better film that inspired it (1973'sThe Day of the Jackal) and get whatever kicks you can from this heavy-metal remake. It's not bad as hokey thrillers go, but all of the original film's suspenseful finesse has been traded in (not traded up) for bigger, bolder action and nonsensical plotting. It's as if Hollywood had forgotten to create excitement without resorting to overblown action and heavy hardware, but there's ample compensation in the casting of Bruce Willis and Richard Gere. Willis is the elusive assassin known only as the Jackal, whose latest target (he uses a cannon-sized gun that's anything but inconspicuous) may be the first lady of the United States. Gere plays a former IRA terrorist who is recruited by the deputy head of the FBI (Sidney Poitier) to trace the Jackal's maneuvers, and Diane Venora offers some gutsy support as a Russian-born agent who assists Gere on his mission. The movie has fun turning Willis into a master of disguise, and Gere adds much-needed gravity to counter the plot's escalating absurdity, but this is the kind of film that falls apart if you think about it too much.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000IO4G", "6304258984", "0792147618", "0783202253", "B00003CXUX", "0792133153", "6303696813", "B00003G1FZ", "6301697758", "B00004WIDB", "6301208773", "0792116887", "076781956X", "B00003JRAB", "6302945089", "B0002GTWOM", "B00007CVYA", "6305718792", "B000059XYK", "6303313345", "6300183211", "0800125762", "6302842476", "0800199421", "078322530X", "079212569X", "6304214502", "6305622825", "6303269834", "0800178394", "B00003BE3X", "B00004RVRP", "630300394X", "6303486746", "6304826133", "6304259131", "B00003CXN3", "0790748169", "6305171750", "6303447589", "630470786X", "0793927501", "630348431X", "0783222955", "B00003OSSM", "6301071379", "079213690X", "0790731274", "0790731975", "B000006FNX", "6303383300", "6303953425", "B00005A7VC", "079073799X", "0790733927", "B00005JKIO", "6305368139"], "bought_together": ["B00000IO4G"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 435268}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.25, "brand": "", "asin": "0783223218", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515MWW5PDEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Jackal  [VHS]"}
{"description": "It seems that thrillers these days--even good ones--are all about scene-chewing bad guys, cute retorts fit for the Dennis Miller show, and one big special effect to end the movie. Well, something likeThe Peacemaker, the first feature film from DreamWorks, puts the record straight. Here is an expertly paced thriller with a sensible villain, smart instead of cute dialogue, and a focus on action instead of special effects. It's not original, just solid. It's the second of these energetic and effective thrillers that writer Michael Schiffer (Crimson Tide) has penned. The White House Nuclear Smuggling Group tracks down 10 stolen nuclear bombs after a suspicious train wreck in Russia. The acting head of the department (Nicole Kidman) and her military field officer (George Clooney) are off to Europe to track down the bombs. Instead of a Gary Oldman-Bruce Dern madman,The Peacemaker's heavy is an unknown Romanian actor (Marcul Iures) playing a Bosnian rebel who works passionately and quietly. This may be a popcorn movie, but it uses the ripe emotions of the Bosnian War to create tension. This is the best film vehicle yet for the overwhelming charisma of George Clooney as a quick witted, generally warm Oliver North type who will seek deadly vengeance without pause. He's matched very well by the professional polish of Nicole Kidman who is showing great flexibility in dividing her roles between serious and fun fare.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792133153", "6303696813", "0783227264", "079212569X", "0783223218", "0792116887"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 489054}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.92, "brand": "", "asin": "0783224079", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MXMH3PZ1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Peacemaker [VHS]"}

Francis Sullivan played Jaggers, a role so meant for him that he played it again in the 1947 version of the film.

Sharon Stone is the stand out among the actors; she nabbed an Oscar nomination for her role as the voracious Ginger, the glitzy call girl who becomes Rothstein's wife.

{"description": "It's hard to ignore the sad and conspicuous absence of the late John Belushi, but this long-delayed sequel to 1980'sThe Blues Brothersstill has Dan Aykroyd--as Chicago bad boy and blues rocker Elwood Blues--to keep the music alive. Once again, Elwood's trying to reunite the original Blues Brothers Band, and this time he's got a strip-joint bartender (John Goodman) and a 10-year-old orphan named Buster (J. Evan Bonifant) joining him at center stage. Believing that Elwood has kidnapped the kid, the cops are hot on his trail as the reunited band hits the road for the Battle of the Bands in Louisiana and the All-Star Blues Jam that ends the movie in a rockin' blaze of glory. It's a shameless clone of the first film, and nobody--especially not Aykroyd or director John Landis--seems to care that the story's not nearly as fun as the music that's used to stretch it out. Of course there's a seemingly endless parade of stunts, including a nonstop pileup of police cars that's hilariously absurd, but what really matters here--indeed, the movie's only saving grace--is the great lineup of legendary blues musicians. Aretha Franklin, James Brown, Junior Wells, Eric Clapton, B.B. King, Jonny Lang, Eddie Floyd, and Blues Traveler are among the many special guests assembled for the film, and their stellar presence makes you wonder if the revived Blues Brothers shouldn't remain an obscure opening act.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783231482"], "bought_together": ["0783231482"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 258505}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.49, "brand": "", "asin": "0783227078", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DGQ2RVTPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blues Brothers 2000 [VHS]"}

{"description": "The original cowriter and director ofFear and Loathing in Las Vegaswas Alex Cox, whose earlier filmSid and Nancysuggests that Cox could have been a perfect match in filming  Hunter&nbsp;S. Thompson's psychotropic masterpiece of \"gonzo\" journalism. Unfortunately Cox departed due to the usual \"creative differences,\" and this ill-fated adaptation was thrust upon Terry Gilliam, whose formidable gifts as a visionary filmmaker were squandered on the seemingly unfilmable elements of Thompson's ether-fogged narrative. The result is a one-joke movie without the joke--an endless series of repetitive scenes involving rampant substance abuse and the hallucinogenic fallout of a road trip that's run crazily out of control. Johnny Depp plays Thompson's alter ego, \"gonzo\" journalist Raoul Duke, and Benicio Del Toro is his sidekick and so-called lawyer Dr. Gonzo. During the course of a trip to Las Vegas to cover a motorcycle race, they ingest a veritable chemistry set of drugs, and Gilliam does his best to show us the hallucinatory state of their zonked-out minds. This allows for some dazzling imagery and the rampant humor of stumbling buffoons, and the mumbling performances of Depp and Del Toro wholeheartedly embrace the tripped-out, paranoid lunacy of Thompson's celebrated book. But over two hours of this insanity tends to grate on the nerves--like being the only sober guest at a party full of drunken idiots. So while Gilliam's film may achieve some modest cult status over the years, it's only becauseFear and Loathingis best enjoyed by those who are just as stoned as the characters in the movie.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006H32EI", "B006ISJQ1W", "B00003CXWV", "0767837398", "B002AF4Y9G", "B000A7DVR2", "B001EDFSIQ", "0679785892", "B0057ZAA6W", "6305313687", "B00029RTAI", "B0007DFJ0G", "B002QEHPQU", "B00008975Z", "B001HN69AY", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00005JM23", "B000F7CECK", "B000JMK6LW", "B000093FLA", "B000P0J09M", "B003HKN52U", "0783225903", "B00005R87R", "B004SIP95G", "B00000IRE6", "B000031EFY", "B00005ATQB", "B005Y4I6VW", "B0006HBZE2", "B00005Q4CS", "B004FQX5B6", "B009NNXQJW", "B0000VD04M", "B00006JDU8", "B00005V9HH", "B00011CZRE", "B002T9H2LA", "B000C20VPA", "B002CPMB9O", "B000AXWHSA", "B000ASDFI6", "B000P0J0D8", "0792838068", "B003W88QVC", "B00029RTCG", "B0011E5M66", "B0007PALZ2", "B00005JMJG", "B007D0FVRM", "B001J9KJ4I", "B006ISJQBM", "B000EMGJAO", "B0000CDUT5", "B000KB4898", "B0000AC8LR", "B004P7CNC2", "B004SIP7TE", "B00AEFXE9U", "B004SIP8ES", "B00AEFYS2M", "B000C20VRS", "B0000AC8LI", "B00ALU48M0", "B0009A40ES", "B000LP6KNU", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00AEBB8NI", "B0000640VJ", "B004SIP6LS", "B000286RP2", "B000GGSMC6", "0780621611", "B001HN694K", "B00009W5CA", "B004XVMCH6", "B001GCUO0W", "B000GBEWGQ", "B0006GAOJA", "B008R65XYC", "B000IY04Q8", "B000006NN1", "B000S6M1Y4", "B0012E2GFK", "B0007UC8Y4", "B0043X1FM2", "B0001CNRRU", "B00ALU46VI", "0767835093", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005NTOH", "B000MMMT9G", "B005LAIIJY", "B00AG4714S", "B00000K3TS", "B000053VAZ", "B00009MGEM", "B001M4YZ90", "B002ZG980U", "1451659717"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXWV"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0679785892", "B00029RTAI", "0783225903", "B000A7DVR2"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3274}, "asin": "0783229526", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51LL2U2I2AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"}

{"description": "Directed by Sidney Lumet (Serpico) and penned by Joel Schumacher (Batman and Robin), this lavish 1978 adaptation of the Broadway hitThe Wizwas the biggest production filmed in New York City up to that point, utilizing the newly revamped Astoria Studios and locations around the city. Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, Nipsey Russell, and Ted Ross (reprising his Tony-winning role as the Lion) star in this Academy Award-nominated musical for the whole family.The Wizis probably the grandest take on L.&nbsp;Frank Baum's classic  taleThe Wizard of Oz.  The  production team created sets with a sense of urban magic and spectacle: a New York subway station literally comes to life, and the massive plaza between the World Trade Center towers is transformed into the Emerald City, featuring nearly 400 dancers with three costume changes. Like all good musicals, theQuincy Jones arrangementsare highly hummable long after viewing (especially the funky \"Ease On Down the Road\" and the inspirational \"Brand New Day\"). In an era before MTV, the camera stays nearly stationary as Ross and Lena Horne vocally soar through their numbers. Their stage-like performances successfully make the leap to film, makingThe Wiza testament to their singing talents and star presence. The then-thirtysomething Ross raised some eyebrows playing the traditionally teenaged Dorothy, but she and her supporting cast (including Richard Pryor as the Wiz) carry the tunes with an infectious verve that will appeal to folks of all ages.--Shannon Gee", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000B5XOSY", "B00004Z4SE", "B000002I8P", "B000002P75", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B00007AJG2", "B0084NZEE2", "B0033TJATW", "B00005A1T0", "B000JLTRH2", "B002CWKU36", "B0000VCZKM", "B00005TQ44", "B00008CMRM", "B0000DZ3EN", "B007OAAK0O", "B000BUE5FA", "B00465I1CE", "B002TYZKIM", "B00005RIIY", "0573680914", "B00441GZ1Y", "B002LFJXL4", "B00C7JGDBW", "B0000TWMQ6", "B000BNTMAA", "B000BOH922", "B00005JO4H", "B005F96UJ6", "B000Y11B8K", "B0000AM6IY", "B002LFJXKU", "B0002HCWQQ", "B003YCL0SM", "B000065V3J", "B00000J2KE", "B0000W5J4A", "B000A2RRF4", "B00066FAOE", "B00014X83G", "B000667HHW", "B00JDB4PEY", "B0030A0ZD4", "B00005RDAN", "B002D0L0R2", "1476705968", "1849382611", "B00465I192", "B0009A40NO", "B000056WR6", "B00BYS0RQE", "B000GDI27E", "076781326X", "B001DJLD12", "B003NH42HE", "B00003L9CK", "B004498KPU", "B00006RJAA", "B00004XMTJ", "B00E1HIX66", "B0084I9QIW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004Z4SE", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B0033TJATW", "B00JDB4PEY"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 64202}, "asin": "0783233493", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/610WYFVWY5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Wiz"}
{"description": "Released in late 1999,The Bone Collectorwas originally promoted as a thriller in the tradition ofThe Silence of the LambsandSeven, suggesting that it would earn a place among those earlier, better films. Nice try, but no cigar.The Bone Collectorsettles instead for mere competence and the modest rewards of a well-handled formula. With a terrific cast at his service, director Phillip Noyce (Dead Calm,Patriot Games) turns the pulpy indulgence of Jeffery Deaver's novel into a slick potboiler that is grisly fun only if you don't pick it apart.Noyce expertly builds palpable tension around a series of gruesome murders that lead us into the darkest nooks of New York City. Now a bedridden quadriplegic prone to life-threatening seizures and suicidal depression, forensics detective Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) gets a new lease on life with a sharp young beat cop (Angelina Jolie) who's a wizard at analyzing crime scenes. She does field work while he deciphers clues from his high-tech Manhattan loft, and as they narrow the search their lives are increasingly endangered. As this formulaic plot grows moldy, Noyce resorts to narrative shortcuts, using perfunctory scenes to manipulate the viewer and taking morbid pleasure in his revelation of the murder scenes. And yet it all works, to a point, and the cast (including Queen Latifah and Luiz Guzm&aacute;n) is much better than the material. If you're looking for a few good thrills,The Bone Collectoris a pretty safe bet.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFXT1S", "B00AEFYF2K", "B00096S49Y", "B00AP2DC94", "B00011CZRE", "B002NZK5RI", "B00005JMWP", "B00AEFXEGS", "B00005JPD0", "B002GHHHN8", "B002AT8K9W", "B00015YVDG", "B002NZK5UU", "B00029RT9E", "6304884400", "6304765258", "B002NZK5VO", "0792159659", "B00009WVSL", "B000244GCC", "B002O3Z4ZW", "0790732149", "B00DHD933W", "B000GFLKF8", "B0050MB4OO", "B000OT6V0K", "B00AEBBA2W", "B0000VJG72", "B000JYW5BE", "B002NZK5R8", "B002AS464Q", "0790736411", "B00005JKWX", "B000QUCRB4", "B00006HAWN", "B001GKJ2E8", "B000CEV3M8", "6304711891", "B003ASLJIQ", "0767810872", "B00BTYOYG2", "6305428115", "B002AT8KAG", "0790730979", "B002LMV7R0", "B002O3Z4WK", "B00005JN0W", "B00006G8JD", "B00026ZD04", "B00004Z4WR", "B0043X1FNQ", "B005LAIGRS", "B00AEFYGBA", "B00005JLKN", "B004EPYZP8", "0800141806", "B0006HBZXS", "B0006GANOQ", "B000055Y0Y", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B000069HZP", "B00AEBB8LA", "B00005ATZT", "B002ZG997C", "B00005JA9F", "B00BTYU3W6", "0767803434", "B0021L8V0M", "B000244GCW", "B000ENC5YW", "B000R4SMCW", "B001KRVLCI", "B0045HCJFS", "B000P0J0C4", "B00000G3PA", "0783225547", "B00441GYXI", "B00AEFY4CG", "6304806434", "B00009L1TA", "B002GIBVVG", "B00AEFXYJA", "B002ZG99TA", "B0002V7OI8", "B00003CXGV", "B0050UEVNM", "0743491564", "B0045HCJ8K", "B003LR5BD0", "B00125WAWS", "B00000IQC4", "B0001FR3IQ", "6305718954", "B004A8ZX28", "B000G2YCVA", "B00005V4XV", "B001B3LIOC", "B00004BZIY", "6305767866"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFXT1S", "B00096S49Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFXT1S", "B00096S49Y", "B00AP2DC94", "B00005JPD0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15287}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.55, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "0783240295", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H5Y1NXVWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Bone Collector"}
{"description": "Suffering from the extreme bad luck of being released at the same time as the low-budgetThe Blair Witch Project, this adaptation ofThe Haunting of Hill Houseattempts to update Shirley Jackson's psychologically terrifying ghost story to the era of big-budget, computerized special effects. Does it work? Well, let's just say that showing isn't exactly the same as telling. A prime example of bloated studio filmmaking,The Hauntingtelegraphs all its frights so blatantly that it forsakes any of Jackson's subtle horrors for the remedial scares of a clunky carnival ride. The story remains basically the same, with four people called to an old mansion for experiments in the supernatural, but instead of getting inside the heads of its main characters (as the 1963 adaptation by Robert Wise did so well), Jan DeBont's film deserts character development for the huge, glorious set design provided by Eugenio Zanetti (Restoration). Thus, instead of a well-drawn story you get... a well-drawn house, one that four very talented and underutilized actors--Lili Taylor, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Liam Neeson, and Owen Wilson--wander around in endlessly (as Zeta-Jones puts it, the house is \"sort of Charles Foster Kane meets the Munsters\"). Taylor, as the hypersensitive Nell, is the unknowing lynchpin in the battle between good and bad ghosts and gets saddled with most of the expository dialogue of the mansion's gothic backstory. Zeta-Jones (showing some spark) and Neeson (showing none) are sadly reduced to providing reactionary shots of the film's disastrous climax, which mixes hapless new-age affirmations with computer-generated effects of ghosts and exploding windows, walls, doors, etc. For this haunted-house story, take a quick tour of the breathtaking rooms, but definitelydon'tstay the night.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CWRF", "B00005UQ9W", "B0045HCJJE", "B000063US5", "B003VA3JUO", "B002AS45VK", "B00AEBBA2W", "B0000C2IQQ", "B00005LIRD", "B002GHHHL0", "B00AEBBA72", "B00K2CHY1Y", "078322799X", "B004SIP92O", "B000V4UFZK", "B00AEFYXQI", "B00BEIYMAG", "B000CCBC9O", "B001BSBBGC", "B00E32PJ02", "B0000AOX0D", "B000UUX2Z0", "B000HC2LFI", "B0021L8UFI", "B00009PY4G", "0767824954", "B0010X73ZG", "B00AEBB91E", "0800177029", "B00AEFYYH6", "B0008191WO", "B00000IQVQ", "B00008LUNW", "B00003CXKM", "6305718954", "B00005JNY3", "B0002DB54A", "B004LWZW24", "B002VWNIDG", "B00DBNLBAQ", "0783116926", "B000GBEWRU", "0783225482", "B00AIBZLVY", "B004AC6PV2", "B0001FR3IQ", "B000GCFO0I", "B000NOIVT0", "B001B1872U", "B004P7CNUY", "B00004BZIY", "B00005JNBN", "B0009X763M", "B000NQRR1Q", "B00006FDCD", "B000AM6OQ2", "B00005O5B5", "0792839684", "B0000694XX", "B00000JQB5", "0780622650", "6305017115", "B003498SCQ", "1573625779", "B001B8XRT6", "B00000IQC4", "B00AEFXPMG", "6305300801", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00006AUIG", "B000TJ6PBK", "B0006SGYL0", "B004SIP9MY", "B001P3SA9Y", "B00023P4TM", "6305090564", "B000AM4P9K", "B00JPS7HOA", "B00B96TGQS", "B003UGLCIA", "B005LAIGOQ", "B004SIP9O2", "B00DZP1C9K", "B000ARXF96", "B004LWZW2O", "6305767866", "B002945DUW", "B000RIWAVW", "B000FFJYBG", "B00005JOWW", "B005TK23PQ", "B004XVMCN0", "B009XTF8KQ", "B001CFEC2Y", "B00006IUFV", "B00317LM8S", "B0021L8UPS", "B008874968", "6305428042", "B008JFUS0U"], "bought_together": ["B000063US5"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BTYXNRI", "B0045HCJJE", "B000ASATYO", "0783116926"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18281}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.84, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "0783237413", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51aYQx70GGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Haunting"}

{"description": "Apocalyptic visions can take many forms, from atomic to cosmic disaster, from cautionary tale to sardonic despair, comets, asteroids, plague. But when it comes to the end of the world, one expects fire or ice, bang or whimper. Rarely does this genre focus on the area between those two extremes, as it does brilliantly in Don McKellar'sLast Night, a wry tale exploring the effects of the world's imminent demise on a group of characters in Toronto. No panic ensues, no looting, no gnashing of teeth or elaborate schemes to forestall disaster. Well, that may be happening somewhere, but certainly not in Toronto. Here the radio counts down the top 500 hits ofall time. The clock ticks by the evening hours while daylight fails to wane. Everywhere, people prepare for the end in ways that range from the mundane to the winsome. The principal action throws together Patrick (McKellar), a dejected young man who plans on spending the end alone listening to music, with Sandra (Sandra Oh), whose plans to spend the end with her husband (David Cronenberg) are thwarted by lack of transportation. Meanwhile, Patrick's friend Craig (Callum Keith Rennie) is  fulfilling every sexual fantasy he's ever had.Love the one you're withis the message here. The real star is the tone of the picture, which is distanced and ironic and masterfully maintained throughout. Sarah Polley and Genevi&egrave;ve Bujold appear in supporting roles. It's the directorial debut  of actor McKellar (Exotica,eXistenZ), who also scriptedThe Red Violin.--Jim Gay", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 405896}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Last Night", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008R9KL", "B00A92MFQG", "B006KH6CF4", "B000H5VACA", "B0001WTVUW", "B0007TZV3K", "B000EZ908Y", "B0000C89HH", "B00021R7CG", "B003WTO5YI", "B00HW3EWQQ", "B007L6VRBM", "B000MRAAIS", "B00HT2RTU6", "B00H3JHHSE", "B001BSBBIK", "B000NTPG7K", "B00AEFYTMQ", "B00000IXPN", "B00ESZZOLI", "B002TZS5G0", "B0009X770O", "B0009298N4", "B00005QAPI", "B00005B20D", "B001FB563E", "B00H9L26AA", "B00824FK9W", "B0007A5XIM", "B00IVLR9JA", "B00004XPPE", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B003M8NG94", "B000068QP0", "B003102JDM", "B000N6TX1I", "B00AEFYPLG", "B009H3LOX8", "B006KH6CI6", "B00008438U", "B00JBBRLYW", "B0045HCJTO", "B002LFPBLU", "B00664AM5C", "B000286RNE", "B009B8YZ76", "B000YRY8BG", "B000067J0M", "B008I34YEE", "B005J4TLN4", "B004BZ5AMS", "B0007TKNLA", "B00DZP1BZ0", "B0009S2T0M", "B0013LL2Z2", "B00004Z4SD", "B00062IXHO", "B00ECGHVHI", "B000FVQLKW", "B00AEBB89W", "B00GSTHBTK", "B00DBNLAZW", "B005FQ2H8W", "B00GGY4R3K", "B008RO6PJQ", "B0006GAO5Y", "B002AF4Y9G", "B0007CEXUY", "B0002IQMAM", "B00BPEJX12", "B000JLQPYK", "0783231032", "B001MEJY8W", "B001BGS17Q", "B0000EYUCK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00008R9KL", "B005335K8G", "B000EZ908Y", "B000GI3KGC"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517O2HkQtVL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "0783240228"}

{"description": "Stanley Kubrick'sThe Shiningis less an adaptation of Stephen King's bestselling horror novel than a complete reimagining of it from the inside out. In King's book, the Overlook Hotel is a haunted place that takes possession of its off-season caretaker and provokes him to murderous rage against his wife and young son. Kubrick's movie is an existential Road Runner cartoon (his steadicam scurrying through the hotel's labyrinthine hallways), in which the cavernously empty spaces inside the Overlook mirror the emptiness in the soul of the blocked writer, who's settled in for a long winter's hibernation. As many have pointed out, King's protagonist goes mad, but Kubrick's Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is Looney Tunes from the moment we meet him--all arching eyebrows and mischievous grin. (Both Nicholson and Shelley Duvall reach new levels of hysteria in their performances, driven to extremes by the director's fanatical demands for take after take after take.)The Shiningis terrifying--but not in the way fans of the novel might expect. When it was redone as a TV miniseries (reportedly because of King's dissatisfaction with the Kubrick film), the famous topiary-animal attack (which was deemed impossible to film in 1980) was there--but the deeper horror was lost. Kubrick'sThe Shininggets under your skin and chills your bones; it stays with you, inhabits you, haunts you. And there's no place to hide...--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300267881", "0790734079", "B00005ATQA", "6302038308", "6300182770", "B0009RRUKW", "0783235607", "0783228317", "B00000J2KZ", "B00004RNAC", "0790736039", "B00023NRSM", "6304508611", "6300182878", "6302921058", "6304509154", "0783216084", "6300214087", "B00004W5UA", "6301427076", "630268644X", "B000003KHS", "B000AMW2TK", "0790700506", "6300181340", "6300214753", "6302054982", "0784011923", "6305363668", "6303686796", "6305095566", "630021639X", "6302822688", "6305576173", "0783246641", "6304994540", "6303953425", "B00004U8PA", "0792158261", "0792100085", "6300213986", "6300189015", "630533577X", "6300214826", "0792846303", "6304288433", "6300147630", "0792842111", "B000007OY0", "0790741512", "6302158176", "0792846311", "6300183416", "0800103106", "B000005PFL", "6300183211", "0790733927", "6301666569", "6301871952", "0767825411", "630339406X", "6303109950", "6300216500", "6300214192", "6300262731", "6303257674", "6304214502", "630018627X", "6300214311", "1558807381", "0792839234", "0767819187", "B00005B238", "0790731975", "6303579388", "B000059HFB", "6302798450", "B00000FZCU", "6303651461", "6303566391", "6302642175", "6301971582", "6300218058", "6301094352", "6300184064", "6300181278", "6304457383", "6300214672", "6300262855", "0800125762", "6303257305"], "bought_together": ["0790734079"], "also_viewed": ["6300147630", "6300182878", "B00005ATQA", "6300189015", "6300267881", "B00023NRSM", "6300213005", "6303953425", "0307743659", "6303148352", "0790734079", "B001AQT0Z4", "6300183211", "0784011923", "B00BBND56G", "0788806270"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 268792}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0790705141", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5106FV0S4PL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Shining [VHS]"}
{"description": "EDITOR'S NOTE: According to a Warner Home Video technician involved in  the production ofThe Stanley Kubrick Collection, Kubrick authorized all aspects of theCollection, from the use of Digital Component Video (or \"D-1\") masters originally approved in 1989, to the use of minimalist screen menus, chapter stops, and (in the case of2001: A Space OdysseyandThe Shiningon DVD) supplementary materials. Full-screen presentation ofThe ShiningandFull Metal Jacketwas also approved by Kubrick, who recomposed his original framing,  reportedly believing that those films looked best on video in the full-screen format. (In fact, the original theatrical aspect ratio ofThe Shiningwas 1.66:1, meaning that a relatively small portion of the image is lost.) Kubrick also chose mono over stereo,  believing that inconsistencies in theatrical sound systems resulted in loss of control over theatrical presentation. In every respect, the Warner spokesman  said, the films in theCollectionremain as Kubrick approved them. Any future attempt to remaster or alter them would  have to be approved by an appointee of the Kubrick estate.", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301115430", "6300214826", "630018627X", "6304935811", "6301979761", "B00006C7G9", "B00000J2L7", "0784011923", "0790748169", "630407185X", "0800132009", "6302816580", "6301208773", "B00000JGEI", "B000BT8VVK", "B00000IO4G", "630018224X", "0792133153", "6300248135", "6302054982", "630300394X", "B00000K3AN", "6303696813", "6303020089", "6302415853", "6304826133", "6303029027", "0783235607", "6304259131", "B000065JH1", "0800179552", "6301217977", "B00007CVYA", "0800116917", "B0000CDL3W", "6304214502", "6302935148", "6304414099", "6303168507", "076783819X", "6300248089", "0800125762", "630018403X", "6300213005", "6303269834", "6303109950", "6300246965", "B00006IUOZ", "6300183211", "6304925131", "0783202253", "0783107986", "079213690X", "B000005XXG", "B00000FZCU", "0800187873", "6300214540"], "bought_together": ["6301115430", "6300214826"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 348239}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0790701251", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZM1C6TC7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Full Metal Jacket [VHS]"}

{"description": "It's enlightening to view Tim Burton'sMars Attacks!as his twisted satire of the blockbuster filmIndependence Day, which was released earlier the same year, although the movies were in production simultaneously. Burton's eye-popping, schlock tribute to 1950s UFO movies actually plays better on video than it did in theaters. The idea of invading aliens ray gunning the big-name movie stars in the cast is a cleverly subversive one, and the bulb-headed, funny-sounding animated Martians are pretty nifty, but it all seemed to be spread thin on the big screen. On video, however, the movie's kooky humor seems a bit more concentrated. The Earth actors (most of whom get zapped or kidnapped for alien science experiments) include Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Annette Bening, Pierce Brosnan, Danny DeVito, Martin Short, Sarah Jessica Parker, Rod Steiger, Michael&nbsp;J.

{"description": "In the early spring of 1993, a year before the series was launched, the two-hour movie and series pilotBabylon 5: The Gatheringappeared. This proto-Babylonstaked out the initial territory for the series (some of which would change by the first episode), introducing primary characters and sketching out the alliances and rifts in interplanetary diplomacy. Some of the primary characters bowed out after their initial appearances (Tamlyn Tomita's Lt. Commander Laurel Takashima and Johnny Seka's Dr. Benjamin Kyle never returned; Patricia Tallman's telepath Lyta Alexander made periodic revisits beginning in the second season, eventually rejoining the cast permanently). Set on the first anniversary of theBabylon 5(none of the first four stations survived even a month), the central story involves the attempted assassination of the newly arrived Vorlon, the mysterious Ambassador Kosh, at the hands of (perhaps) Commander Jeffrey Sinclair (Michael O'Hare). Security Chief Michael Garibaldi (Jerry Doyle, a smart-aleck tough guy in the Bruce Willis vein) investigates and uncovers a web of conspirators, a portent of things to come. When TNT picked up the series for the fifth season Straczynski reedited the pilot, weaving back in a dropped subplot while cutting the rest of the film more tightly, tweaking special effects, and commissioning a new score from Christopher Franke. This is the cut released on video, a stronger, more engaging film, but still a broad first stab at characters that would redefine themselves through the course of the show's run.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00005NTNP"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 531868}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 4.83, "brand": "", "asin": "0790736683", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JM3XYQ4CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Babylon 5 - The Gathering (Series Pilot Film) [VHS]"}
{"description": "Steven Seagal has always been an awkward action hero. Initially, he had  a certain amount of credibility thanks to his nebulous association with secret government agencies and mastery of aikido, which helped to excuse his bad acting. But as a self-righteous action hero in the vein of Schwarzenegger and Stallone (which helps to explain his bad acting), Seagal fell into unintentional self-parody faster and more dramatically than either of his two predecessors. InOut for Justice, Seagal plays Gino Felino, a Brooklyn-born cop known and respected by everyone--both good and bad--in his neighborhood. The worst of the neighborhood baddies is Richie Madano (William Forsythe), a crack-smoking killer who murders his partner and terrorizes the neighborhood. Technically, Felino is a terrible cop--touching evidence at murder scenes, stealing evidence, intimidating witnesses--but only by breaking those rules can he bring in this horrible criminal.

Julianna Margulies (ER) has a small but thankless role as Richie's hooker girlfriend, and Gina Gershon (Face/Off,Bound) has an equally thankless role  as Richie's foul-mouthed, bar-owning sister.

{"description": "Black comedy and suspenseful action inside a German POW camp during World War II--a setting that was later borrowed for the TV sitcomHogan's Heroes. The great director Billy Wilder adapted the hit stage play, applying his own wicked sense of humor to the apparently bleak subject matter. William Holden plays an antisocial grouse amid a gang of wisecracking though indomitable American prisoners.

Frank Marshall (Arachnophobia) demonstrates no control over story, actors, effects, or general presentation in this adaptation of a Michael Crichton novel about an expedition into deep, dark Africa that runs into an unknown race of killer apes.

{"description": "After the Oscar-winning The English Patient, writer/director Anthony Minghella attempted another tricky literary adaptation with The Talented Mr. Ripley, which features heartthrob Matt Damon cast against type as a psychopathic bisexual murderer. Tom Ripley (Damon) is a bright and charismatic sociopath who makes his way in mid-'50s New York City as a men's room attendant and sometimes pianist, though his real skill is in impersonating other people, forging handwriting, and running second-rate scams. After being mistaken for a Princeton student, Tom meets the shipping tycoon father of Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law), who has traveled to the coast of Italy, where he's living a carefree life with his father's money and his beautiful girlfriend, Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow). Dickie's father will pay Ripley 1,000 dollars plus his expenses if he can persuade Dickie to return to America. As Ripley and Dickie become friends, Tom finds himself both attracted to Dickie and envious of his life of pleasure. In time, he decides that he would rather be Dickie Greenleaf than Tom Ripley, so rather than go back to his life of poverty, Ripley impulsively murders Dickie and assumes his identity. The Talented Mr. Ripley was based on the first of a series of novels featuring Tom Ripley written by Patricia Highsmith; the story was previously filmed in 1960 as Purple Noon, with Alain Delon as Ripley.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000E33VWW", "B004SIP71M", "B0014GI6I2", "B00112S8RS", "B0013XZ2QK", "B008220DGE", "B002LVVCJY", "B00008WI9N", "B001P3SA8K", "B0060ZJ7DA", "B00018D40O", "B00AQBDU4Q", "B00003CWTI", "6305803765", "B0000BXMZ8", "B000PAAJZ6", "B00005BCK9", "B009D004TA", "B00008K7AO", "B00320J6WS", "B00000IC7G", "B002AT8KAG", "B00AEFXE9U", "B0006GW2JU", "B00GUO2SKA", "0393332144", "B00AQTY3JO", "6305781095", "B00005JMW7", "0783226845", "B00000G02H", "B00G7QPXUI", "B000M341SC", "B0060ZJ7BC", "B0009W5IMO", "B00H9KKGTO", "B000P5FH3K", "B00077BOFG", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B000HRMAPE", "B000BOH904", "B0036TGSR6", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00H9L26AA", "B004SIP7F8", "0788815490", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B004SUDQ22", "B0000VD02Y", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00562D3Y2", "B000A7DVR2", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B004SIP8W0", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00AMEZDK6", "B00005LIRC", "B000QGEB1M", "B000059XTI", "B004SIP6QI", "B000189LE2", "6305213305", "B0000640VK", "B000EQHXNW", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B001MSYH7Q", "B00D2CYU2W", "B000NIVJFY", "B00005JKN2", "B002ZG9800", "B00079Z9VO", "B00005R87R", "B000034CZA", "B00AEFYC96", "B008220DIC", "0792844807", "B004SIP73U", "B000MZHW40", "B0007UC8Y4", "B0016Q2D66", "6305065551", "B0045HCJ8K", "B00006RCNY", "B0010X8NF0", "B0001DCYUU", "6305781052", "B00005V5NU", "B0012OX7EO", "B000P0J0D8", "B00008G7UL", "6305428239", "0792846443", "B0045O2PHS", "6304696515", "B000F1IQN2", "B00GM7STPI", "B00AEFY8MM", "B00003CWRX"], "bought_together": ["B000E33VWW", "B004SIP71M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00JAQJMJ0", "0783225903", "B002ZG97RE", "B009D004TA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 52816}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.79, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "0792165020", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516X8NQJ30L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Talented Mr. Ripley"}

{"description": "Martin Scorsese's brutal black-and-white biography of self-destructive boxer Jake LaMotta was chosen as the best film of the 1980s in a major critics' poll at the end of the decade, and it's a knockout piece of filmmaking. Robert De Niro plays LaMotta (famously putting on 50 pounds for the later scenes), a man tormented by demons he doesn't understand and prone to uncontrollably violent temper tantrums and fits of irrational jealousy. He marries a striking young blond (Cathy Moriarty), his sexual ideal, and then terrorizes her with never-ending accusations of infidelity. Jake is as frightening as he is pathetic, unable to control or comprehend the baser instincts that periodically, and without warning, turn him into the rampaging beast of the title. But as Roman Catholic Scorsese sees it, he works off his sins in the boxing ring, where his greatest athletic talent is his ability to withstand punishment. The fight scenes are astounding; they're like barbaric ritual dance numbers. Images smash into one another--a flashbulb, a spray of sweat, a fist, a geyser of blood--untilyoufeel dazed from the pummeling. Nominated for a handful of Academy Awards (including best picture and director),Raging Bullwon only two, for De Niro and for editor Thelma Schoonmacher.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767830555", "B000286RP2", "B006TTC5HC", "B000C20VPA", "B000P0J09M", "B0000DI87S", "B000A2UBN4", "B000CNESTE", "B004FQX5B6", "B00004XPPB", "B00AEFXN9G", "0792833287", "B00006RCNV", "B003ELKNH2", "B0050FXDDQ", "B0006GANN2", "B00003CXBU", "B0019L770A", "B00079Z9VO", "B000C20VRS", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000M341QE", "B004SIP7TE", "B000P0J0AG", "B00008975Z", "B0019L21GA", "B000WC39ZY", "079284646X", "B00AEBB95K", "B004SIP95G", "B0018CMJSU", "B002VWNIAY", "B00009W5CA", "6304907729", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000ARTN3I", "B00008RH3L", "B0000AM6JI", "B00005ATQB", "B000RTB0R6", "B003AWRMCE", "B00AEBB9CS", "B000286RR0", "B004L9GMBC", "6305263248", "B000LP6KNU", "B000P0J09C", "B0045HCJ8U", "B000P0J0EW", "B00080ZG10", "B00006ADD5", "B00004XPPC", "B00005V9HH", "B00003CWTI", "B002VWNIDG", "B003UESJHO", "B0006GAO5Y", "0792846109", "B00AEBB89C", "B002VWNICC", "B000063JDE", "B00005JKMQ", "B008R65XYC", "0767827902", "B000022TSY", "B002CPMB9O", "B00066FBQG", "B007STBUHI", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0001US62I", "B004U7MR14", "B00008O38F", "B000A7DVR2", "B001WLMOL4", "B000055Y0X", "B0087ZG7R0", "078324228X", "B0049985XW", "B003XURDAY", "B00GMT69C6", "B000063US2", "B00003CXWV", "B0045HCJTO", "B003ASLJQI", "B000CNESU8", "B000PAAJZ6", "B006FE83UE", "B00AEBB8NI", "B006TTC5MM", "0783225725", "0780618564", "B0019UGYK0", "B00001ZWUS", "6304698798", "6305941122", "B007Y1NR1W", "B003ZEQMH8", "6305918880", "B007TBIUSM", "B0087ZG7UW"], "bought_together": ["0767830555", "B006TTC5HC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00H9KKGTO", "B00008975Z", "B0018CMJSU", "B000C20VPA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 225981}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.7, "brand": "", "asin": "0792833236", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518QQEM9XPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Raging Bull"}

{"description": "David Lynch peeks behind the picket fences of small-town America to reveal a corrupt shadow world of malevolence, sadism, and madness. From the opening shots Lynch turns the Technicolor picture postcard images of middle class homes and tree-lined lanes into a dreamy vision on the edge of nightmare. After his father collapses in a preternaturally eerie sequence, college boy Kyle MacLachlan returns home and stumbles across a severed human ear in a vacant lot. With the help of sweetly innocent high school girl (Laura Dern), he turns junior detective and uncovers a frightening yet darkly compelling world of voyeurism and sex. Drawn deeper into the brutal world of drug dealer and blackmailer Frank, played with raving mania by an obscenity-shouting Dennis Hopper in a career-reviving performance, he loses his innocence and his moral bearings when confronted with pure, unexplainable evil. Isabella Rossellini is terrifyingly desperate as Hopper's sexual slave who becomes MacLachlan's illicit lover, and Dean Stockwell purrs through his role as Hopper's oh-so-suave buddy. Lynch strips his surreally mundane sets to a ghostly austerity, which composer Angelo Badalamenti encourages with the smooth, spooky strains of a lush score.Blue Velvetis a disturbing film that delves into the darkest reaches of psycho-sexual brutality and simply isn't for everyone. But for a viewer who wants to see the cinematic world rocked off its foundations, David Lynch delivers a nightmarish masterpiece.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304510861", "6303018351", "0790705141", "6300182770", "6302185882", "6303515304", "6300147630", "6304346158", "6300214044", "6302226899", "B000067DGJ", "B00004T37H", "0792839846", "630026999X", "0792846303", "6303422969", "0783229585"], "also_viewed": ["6302185882", "6300182770"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 325598}, "asin": "0792838084", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71W22ZVC1XL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Blue Velvet [VHS]"}

{"description": "Mary Harron's feature--which picked up a Special Jury Award at the 1996 Sundance Film Festival for lead actress and independent film mainstay Lili Taylor--is a highly suspect mishmash of golly-gee counterculture reconstruction and inflammatory agitprop. Harron re-creates the ultimately violent relationship of motor-mouth street freak writer-prostitute-lesbian-gun-wielding assailant Valerie Solanas (Taylor) and pop artist Andy Warhol (Jared Harris) in the late 1960s, which ended in Solanas's assault on Warhol for his charmingly noncommittal responses to her search for a patron. It's a great idea for a film, butI Shot Andy Warholis truly at odds with itself. Harron's modular construction of the story--part naive reenactment of the instant-celebrity life at Warhol's studio, part celebration of Solanas's subversive ramblings, part investigation into the roots of her hyper-victimization at, apparently, the hands of all men--is ultimately a shell game that allows the writer-director to avoid taking a clear stand on Solanas's bizarro politics.

{"description": "A rare example of a sequel topping the original,F/X 2gives us more of the adventures of special-effects whiz Rollie Tyler (Bryan Brown).  Rollie is recruited by his wife's ex-husband into developing one of his devices for a police sting, but when it goes terribly wrong, Rollie's on the run and in need of help from ex-cop friend Leo McCarthy (Brian Dennehy).  Most of the fun, of course, comes from seeing Rollie in action, whether he's using toys developed in his lab (such as a remote-controlled clown suit) or improvising gimmicks on the run, such as in an exciting supermarket showdown.  Rachel Ticotin appears as Rollie's wife, and two actresses who have appeared on Broadway, Josie de Guzman (Guys and Dolls, 1992) and Joanna Gleason (Tony winner forInto the Woods, 1987), play Leo's old flames, police computer whiz Velez and assistant D.A.

{"description": "Cliffhangerwas a 1994 comeback of sorts for action hero Sylvester Stallone, this time thanks to director Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2andNightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master) and some spectacularly rugged and vertigo-inducing high- mountain terrain. The opening sequence alone delivers what the title promises, and there's a doozy of an airplane stunt that was later reprised, with modifications, inAir Force One. Stallone, looking as tough and craggy as the mountains themselves, is a rescue climber who finds himself going after a gang of crooks (headed by John Lithgow in his bad-guy mode) who've hijacked a U.S. Treasury plane and crash landed in the Rockies (played by the Italian Dolomites) with millions of bucks. Outrageous action-packed, snow-packed, and scenery-packed chase sequences (featuring whirring helicopters, whooshing skis, popping gunfire, and clanging pitons that earned the movie Oscar nominations for sound and sound editing) take full advantage of the digital video disc's Dolby Digital 5.1 sound.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0045HCJG2", "B0045HCJ5S", "B000U1ZV62", "0783226934", "B0045HCJGC", "1558908846", "6304779631", "B000QUCRB4", "B00003CXQG", "B0045HCJFS", "B001B3LIOC", "B0004Z33G4", "6304602944", "B0001FGBWK", "B000MEYKEG", "B000056PNL", "B0006GANOQ", "B002GHHHH4", "6304806434", "B00003CXTM", "B002AT8KA6", "B004SIP6WW", "B000U1ZV8K", "B0000VV5BM", "B002GHHHME", "B00015YVDG", "B0015XHP2C", "B0006HBZXS", "6304711891", "B000QXDCLU", "B000N4RAS8", "B00315462E", "0783225547", "B00E8G5HQE", "B00441GYY2", "0767803434", "B008NP4ZUU", "B000JYW5BE", "B0002S94CK", "B000U1ZV4Y", "B001M9ELQC", "B00026ZG10", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B000CEV3M8", "B00000G3PA", "B001KRVLCI", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B0004Z33EG", "B0050MB5NO", "B000BMY2N8", "B00070FX5U", "B00AEFXKZ8", "B00005ATZT", "B000FI8MPW", "B00005N5S5", "6304765258", "0790732149", "B000B8GT92", "B00441GYXI", "B00158K0QU", "B0045HCIWW", "B000BPL2FQ", "B00AEBB9UK", "B000055Y0Y", "B002GHHHL0", "0790736411", "B00008L3UQ", "0767802497", "B0015XHP4A", "B000YCPUWW", "B002GHHHP6", "B007AFBYYY", "0783225504", "B00005JKIP", "0767810872", "B003ASLJMW", "B000E0WJLE", "B00005T7HZ", "B001ECDVK4", "B003ASLJOU", "0767807588", "B002AS464Q", "1558908315", "B000EHSVPK", "B002NZK5UU", "B00009WVSL", "0783225733", "0792835727", "B000EGDB10", "0783230346", "B0006IIPL2", "B003KV3E2M", "B00004Z4WR", "B003AWRMCE", "B000U1ZV6C", "0767804252", "B0001Z37HM", "B0041QSZLA", "B0002V7OI8", "B002NZK5R8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0045HCJGC", "B0045HCJG2", "B002GHHHH4", "6304602944"]}, "price": 7.47, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1056590}, "asin": "0800127803", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/312HH0TBH9L.jpg", "title": "Cliffhanger"}
{"description": "Bill Murray does warmth in his most consistently effective post-Stripescomedy, a romantic fantasy about a wacky weatherman forced to relive one strange day over and over again, until he gets it right. Snowed in during a road-trip expedition to watch the famous groundhog encounter his shadow, Murray falls into a time warp that is never explained but pays off so richly that it doesn't need to be. The elaborate loop-the-loop plot structure cooked up by screenwriter Danny Rubin is crystal-clear every step of the way, but it's Murray's world-class reactive timing that makes the jokes explode, and we end up looking forward to each new variation. He squeezes all the available juice out of every scene. Without forcing the issue, he makes us understand why this fly-away personality responds so intensely to the radiant sanity of the TV producer played by Andie MacDowell.

As the story opens, Guinevere's lands are under attack by the evil knight Malagant (Ben Cross), and she must choose between marriage to Arthur and the security of Camelot, or encouraging the affections of Lancelot, who has heroically rescued her from a potentially lethal attack. Anyone looking for meticulous medieval authenticity won't find it here, but director Jerry Zucker (Ghost) keeps the action moving with exuberant spirit and glorious production values.

{"description": "An ultracreepy blend of horror and fantasy (think of it asBeauty and the Bugs) from Mexican director Guillermo del Toro (Cronos) about giant cockroaches in the subway tunnels beneath Manhattan. Like its DNA-altered spawn (the title refers to the way some insects evolve to resemble their predators),Mimicis not your everyday bug picture, but a more poetic (though quite gruesome) sort of film, literally crawling with bizarre, striking images. In this case, the mutant bugs are not the result of evil atomic experiments (as inThem!), but are the unexpected side effect of work done by an entomologist (Mira Sorvino) and her Center for Disease Control officer husband (Jeremy Northam), who, in a last-ditch effort to control a roach-carried disease epidemic that was killing children, released a genetically altered form of sterile cockroaches beneath the city. They stopped the virus, but... Also starring Charles Dutton, Giancarlo Giannini, F.

{"description": "The surprising truth about Disney's 1982 computer-game fantasy is that it's still visually impressive (though technologically quaint by later high-definition standards) and a lot of fun. It's about a computer wizard named Flynn (Jeff Bridges) who is digitally broken down into a data stream by a villainous software pirate (David Warner) and reconstituted into the internal, 3-D graphical world of computers. It is there, in the blazingly colorful, geometrically intense landscapes of cyberspace, that Flynn joins forces with Tron (Bruce Boxleitner) to outmaneuver the Master Control program that holds them captive in the equivalent of a gigantic, infinitely challenging computer game. Disney's wizards used a variety of cinematic techniques and early-'80s state-of-the-art computer-generated graphics to accomplish their dynamic visual goals, and the result was a milestone in cyberentertainment, catering to technogeeks while providing a dazzling adventure for hackers and nonhackers alike. Appearing just in time to celebrate the nascent cyberpunk movement in science fiction,Tronreceived a decidedly mixed reaction when originally released, but has since become a high-tech favorite and a landmark in special effects, with a loyal following of fans.

{"description": "John Reilly (Jeffrey Combs) has come to Italy with wife and blind daughter in tow to arrange for the sale of his newly inherited castle. Unbeknownst to these folks, the duchess who willed the castle to Reilly kept her kid shackled in the dungeon, lambasting him regularly with a wicked cat-o'-nine-tails.  Though the duchess is gone, the eponymous freak remains, now fully grown.  As the family moves into the castle to await its sale, internal conflicts concerning Reilly's guilt over the blinding of the daughter, and the blame from his wife, further fracture their unstable family unit.  Castle Freak escapes his shackles in search of food, and more importantly human warmth.  The Freak just doesn't know how to express his need for love in a socially acceptable way, however, and seems destined for an unsavory end at the hands of the something-to-prove Reilly, who must find some way to route to vicious creature.  But there's more than one way to skin a cat (though they only use one of those ways in this picture).

{"description": "When Universal Pictures picked up the movie rights to a Broadway adaptation ofDracula, they felt secure in handing the property over to the sinister team of actor Lon Chaney and director Tod Browning. But Chaney died of cancer, and Universal hired the Hungarian who had scored a success in the stage play: B&eacute;la Lugosi. The resulting film launched both Lugosi's baroque career and the horror-movie cycle of the 1930s. It gets off to an atmospheric start, as we meet Count Dracula in his shadowy castle in Transylvania, superbly captured by the great cinematographer Karl Freund. Eventually Dracula and his blood-sucking devotee (Dwight Frye, in one of the cinema's truly mad performances) meet their match in a vampire-hunter called Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan). If the later sections of the film are undeniably stage bound and a tad creaky, Dracula nevertheless casts a spell, thanks to Lugosi's creepily lugubrious manner and the eerie silences of Browning's directing style. (After a mood-enhancing snippet ofSwan Lakeunder the opening titles, there is no music in the film.)Frankenstein, which was released a few months later, confirmed the horror craze, and Universal has been making money (and countless spin-off projects) from its twin titans of terror ever since. Certainly the role left a lasting impression on the increasingly addled and drug-addicted Lugosi, who was never quite able to distance himself from the part that made him a star. He was buried, at his request, in his black vampire cape.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300183084", "6300181286", "6300183092", "6300183629", "6302120101", "630252542X", "6302843219", "6300185443", "6302526167", "6301005783", "6301257014", "6302841771", "6302526175", "6303257801", "6302841763", "6302843227", "6300185281", "6300181820", "630284178X", "0783235607", "6302526191", "6302526140", "6302841844", "6300181340", "6301967410", "0783222955", "6302526086", "630018529X", "6304507348", "6302526051", "B00007JME0", "0783240961", "B00AEBB8VK", "630252587X", "6302526094", "6300247589", "B002VWNIAY", "6303626424", "6302843200", "6305576173", "630266232X", "6301327845", "6300215539", "6303402070", "6300182983", "6302309751", "5554306004", "6302841798", "0790705141", "630214227X", "630281474X"], "bought_together": ["6300181286", "6300183092"], "also_viewed": ["6300181286", "6300183629", "6300183092", "6300183084", "6302526175", "6300185281", "6302843219", "630252542X", "6302526140", "6302120101", "B00L8QP0VY", "6302843197", "630018529X", "6302526086", "6302841763", "630252587X", "6302841771", "6302526167", "6300185443", "B00000JMOF", "B00000K14A", "630312917X", "6302843200", "6300214087", "B0001HAGTM", "B008FL8OTK", "B000WNHTCC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 228201}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6300181278", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51588FFRK0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dracula [VHS]"}

{"description": "Rodgers and Hammerstein made BIG musicals--sweeping song and dance numbers, elaborate  stagings, sweet heroines, and love struck but confused heroes.Flower Drum  Songhas all these elements, so why is it so little known? Perhaps because  it had the misfortune to be released the same year (1961) asWest Side  Story, or maybe because at 133 minutes it's overlong, or did the audience  have trouble accepting an all-Asian cast in an Asian-themed musical? Whatever  the reasons, it's time to recognizeFlower Drum Songfor the gem it  is.Picture bride Mei Li (Miyoshi Umeki) and her father arrive in San Francisco,  having smuggled themselves into the country so Mei Li can marry nightclub owner  Sammy Fong (whose mother arranged the whole deal). Mei Li is fascinated by the  city and immediately charms its denizens with a delicate rendition of \"One  Hundred Million Miracles.\" Fong (Jack Soo), who is having an affair with his  star singer, the sexy and scheming Linda Low (Nancy Kwan), pawns Mei Li off on  the Wang family, whose eldest son, Ta (James Shigeta), needs a wife (at least  that's what his father has decided). Old Chinese culture and new American ideals  clash at every turn, with the elders struggling to understand their Americanized  children and the children struggling to accept and honor their heritage. Though  the movie is dated in some respects, the theme of assimilation vs. separation  holds up remarkably well and rings true. \"The Other Generation\" beautifully  illustrates the generation gap.As this is a romantic musical, you know from the beginning which couples will  end up together. The most famous song is \"I Enjoy Being a Girl,\" sung by Linda  Low as she dresses to seduce Wang Ta.

{"description": "The classic science fiction novel by Ray Bradbury was a curious choice for one of the leading directors of the French New Wave, Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut. But from the opening credits onward (spoken, not written on screen), Truffaut takes Bradbury's fascinating premise and makes it his own. The futuristic society depicted inFahrenheit 451is a culture without books. Firemen still race around in red trucks and wear helmets, but their job is to start fires: they ferret out forbidden stashes of books, douse them with gasoline, and make public bonfires. Oskar Werner, the star of Truffaut'sJules and Jim, plays a fireman named Montag, whose exposure toDavid Copperfieldwakens an instinct toward reading and individual thought. (That's why books are banned--they give people too many ideas.) In an intriguing casting flourish, Julie Christie plays two roles: Montag's bored, drugged-up wife and the woman who helps kindle the spark of rebellion. The great Bernard Herrmann wrote the hard-driving music; Nicolas Roeg provided the cinematography.Fahrenheit 451received a cool critical reception and has never quite been accepted by Truffaut fans or sci-fi buffs. Its deliberately listless manner has always been a problem, although that is part of its point; the lack of reading has made people dry and empty. If the movie is a bit stiff (Truffaut did not speak English well and never tried another project in English), it nevertheless is full of intriguing touches, and the ending is lyrical and haunting.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792839846"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 113753}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.74, "brand": "MCA Universal", "asin": "6300184250", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5122B7MF89L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fahrenheit 451 [VHS]"}
{"description": "Besides being a terrific movie in its own right--and the second entry in a remarkable eight-film series teaming director Anthony Mann and star James Stewart--Bend of the Riveris also fascinating as a variation on one of the greatest Westerns. With or without anyone else's knowledge, screenwriter Borden Chase reworked scenes, character configurations, and much of the structure ofRed River, the screenplay of which he had cowritten (from his own novel) for director Howard Hawks six years earlier. Seeing what Hawks and Mann did with some of the same scenes--a spooky night skirmish with Indians, for instance--makes for a compelling lesson in the transformative power of directorial style.Instead of Texas and the Chisholm Trail,Bend of the Riveris set in the Oregon river country, with a wagon train substituting for an epic cattle drive. Wagonmaster Stewart, a man with a secret past he's determined to redeem, rescues another, not-so-ex-renegade (Arthur Kennedy) from a lynching. Stewart finds Kennedy a powerful ally in a fight but ultimately has to face him as a mortal enemy--and to revert to his old savage ways in order to save his adopted community. Along the trail, they are variously companioned and/or menaced by the likes of slick gambler Rock Hudson (compare the Cherry Valance part inRed River) and hard cases Harry (then Henry) Morgan, Royal Dano, and Jack Lambert. There's knockout scenery, as usual with Mann, and fight-to-the-death action as bracing as a plunge into an icy river.--Richard T.

The film concentrates on that threshold-of-adulthood period familiar to past and present 16-year-olds, folding together common experiences of youth (love, hassles with mom, a desire to travel) with the special burdens endured by the hero. Stoltz, absolutely unrecognizable under lots and lots of prosthetic makeup, is quite good, as are Cher (as Rocky's mother) and Sam Elliott (Rocky's father figure).

{"description": "You could only see his eyes behind the layers of makeup, but those expressive orbs earned John Hurt a well-deserved Oscar nomination for his moving portrayal of John Merrick, the grotesquely deformed Victorian-era man better known as The Elephant Man. Inarticulate and abused, Merrick is the virtual slave of a carnival barker (Freddie Jones) until dedicated London doctor Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins in a powerfully understated performance) rescues him from the life and offers him an existence with dignity. Anne Bancroft costars as the actress whose visit to Merrick makes him a social curiosity, with John Gielgud and Wendy Hiller as dubious hospital staffers won over by Merrick. David Lynch earned his only Oscar nominations as director and cowriter of this somber drama, which he shot in a rich black-and-white palette, a sometimes stark, sometimes dreamy visual style that at times recalls the offbeat expressionism of his first film,Eraserhead. It remains a perfect marriage between traditional Hollywood historical drama and Lynch's unique cinematic eye, a compassionate human tale delivered in a gothic vein.

{"description": "You didn't think Mr. Spock wasreallydead, did you? When Spock's casket landed on the surface of the Genesis planet at the end ofStar Trek II, we had already been told that Genesis had the power to bring \"life from lifelessness.\" So it's no surprise that this energetic but somewhat hokey sequel gives Spock a new lease on life, beginning with his rebirth and rapid growth as the Genesis planet literally shakes itself apart in a series of tumultuous geological spasms. As Kirk is getting to know his estranged son (Merritt Butrick), he must also do battle with the fiendish Klingon Kruge (Christopher Lloyd), who is determined to seize the power of Genesis from the Federation. Meanwhile, the regenerated Spock returns to his home planet, andStar Trek IIIgains considerable interest by exploring the ceremonial (and, of course, highly logical) traditions of Vulcan society. The movie's a minor disappointment compared toStar Trek II, but it's a--well, logical--sequel that successfully restores Spock (and first-time film director Leonard Nimoy) to the phenomenalTrekfranchise...as if he were ever really gone.

{"description": "Widely considered the best movie in the \"classicTrek\" series of feature films,Star Trek IVreturns to one of the favorite themes of the original TV series--time travel--to bring Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty, Sulu, Uhura, and Chekov from the 23rd century to present-day San Francisco. In their own time, the Starfleet heroes encounter an alien probe emitting a mysterious message--a message delivered in the song of the now-extinct Earth species of humpback whales. Failure to respond to the probe will result in Earth's destruction, so Kirk and company time-travel to 20th-century Earth--in their captured Klingon starship--to transport a humpback whale to the future in an effort to peacefully communicate with the alien probe. The plot sounds somewhat absurd in description, but as executed by returning director Leonard Nimoy, this turned out to be a crowd-pleasing adventure, filled with humor and lively interaction among the favorite Star Trek characters. Catherine Hicks (from TV's7th Heaven) plays the 20th-century whale expert who is finally convinced of Kirk's and Spock's benevolent intentions. With ample comedy taken from the clash of future heroes with 20th-century urban realities,Star Trek IVwas a box-office smash, satisfying mainstream audiences and hardcoreTrekfans alike.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303202004", "6300213803", "6301543408", "6300216802", "6300214400", "6304415346", "B00008OSD3", "6303909949", "6305587159"], "bought_together": ["6303202004", "6300213803"], "also_viewed": ["6300214400", "6300213803", "6301543408", "6303202004", "6300216802", "6304415346", "0800103106", "B00004U8P4", "6300214540", "630273486X", "630339406X", "6302877881", "B00BAXTYIA", "B00000ILBK", "6304539274", "B00DB97LCM", "B001TH16DI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 116860}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.98, "brand": "", "asin": "630021463X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G68FMQNQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek IV - The Voyage Home [VHS]"}
{"description": "When Samuel (Lukas Haas), a young Amish boy traveling with his mother Rachel (Kelly McGillis), witnesses the murder of a police officer in a public restroom, he and his mother become the temporary wards of John Book (Harrison Ford), a detective who's been assigned to solve the crime. After suspect lineups and mug-shot books yield nothing, Samuel, in the most memorable scene of the film, recognizes the murderer as a narcotics agent whose picture he sees in the precinct. Once Book realizes that the police chief is in on it, too, he whisks Samuel and Rachel back home to Amish country, where he himself goes into hiding as a plain Amish man. The juxtaposition between the life of the Amish and the violence of inner-city police corruption work surprisingly well for the story, and Kelly McGillis as the falling in love widow gives an almost perfect performance. Directed by Peter Weir, the film is extremely successful in drawing the viewer into its world and, accordingly, is immensely entertaining. The only thing that mars its polish is the one-dimensional, almost cartoonish handling of the upper-echelon police corruption--a subtler, more realistic treatment of this aspect of the story would have rendered the film near perfect.--James McGrath", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792116887", "B000007OY0", "6304259131", "0800125762", "6302816629", "6302238331", "6302935148", "0792133153", "6303269834", "B00000JS61", "080018789X", "630442972X", "B000003KDG", "0790743213", "6302415853", "6304071876", "079284517X", "B00005PJ8I", "6303402348", "0790748169", "6303057225", "6303637574", "6301599896", "6303942830", "B0000068ZQ", "6303020089", "6300181340", "0783235607", "6303402070", "B00007E2F6", "0790734079", "6300182479", "B00000J2L7", "6301734734", "079212569X", "6301736362", "6302909023", "0800116917", "6305126062", "6302226899", "6303696813", "6300247112", "0783226152", "B00000F5PI", "6305426678", "B000006N70", "0800132009", "6303058981", "6305012792", "B003MG6FJY", "6301976924", "5559477621", "B00005A1VH", "0783231482", "6303451462", "B000063UUP", "0792107683", "0800123506", "6304458975", "6303109950", "0790733935", "6304214502", "0792838556"], "bought_together": ["0792116887", "6302816629"], "also_viewed": ["6302380588"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 257292}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6300214567", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JAT9P45FL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Witness [VHS]"}

Watts will even go so far as to chauffeur a date for Keith and Amanda, if only to prove--after a lot of patient, emotional anguish--that she's better for Keith than Amanda could ever be. The movie's drama comes from Keith's gradual realization that there's more to love than surface attraction, and Hughes gets extra mileage out of the romantic confusion by allowing Thompson's character to be more than a shallow campus cutie. All three of the leads are good fits in their roles, and this was one of the few teen films of the '80s to add genuine depth to its mainstream appeal. It's one of the few John Hughes movies to stand the test of time.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301008960", "630018403X", "6300214370", "6300263673", "6302814782", "6302862787", "6300214753", "6300184269", "6300268993"], "bought_together": ["6301008960", "6300214370"], "also_viewed": ["B00004TWZK", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00E3QJ7FG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 315546}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.47, "brand": "", "asin": "6300218031", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HHAMC0EML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Some Kind of Wonderful [VHS]"}

{"description": "In the tradition of such obsessively driven directors as Erich von Stroheim and Werner Herzog, Francis Ford Coppola approached the production ofApocalypse Nowas if it were his own epic mission into the heart of darkness. On location in the storm-ravaged Philippines, he quite literally went mad as the project threatened to devour him in a vortex of creative despair, but from this insanity came one of the greatest films ever made. It began as a John Milius screenplay, transposing Joseph Conrad's classic story \"Heart of Darkness\" into the horrors of the Vietnam War, following a battle-weary Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) on a secret upriver mission to find and execute the renegade Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has reverted to a state of murderous and mystical insanity. The journey is fraught with danger involving wartime action on epic and intimate scales. One measure of the film's awesome visceral impact is the number of sequences, images, and lines of dialogue that have literally burned themselves into our cinematic consciousness, from the Wagnerian strike of helicopter gunships on a Vietnamese village to the brutal murder of stowaways on a peasant sampan and the unflinching fearlessness of the surfing warrior Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who speaks lovingly of \"the smell of napalm in the morning.\" Like Herzog'sAguirre: The Wrath of God, this film is the product of genius cast into a pit of hell and emerging, phoenix-like, in triumph. Coppola's obsession (effectively detailed in the riveting documentaryHearts of Darkness, directed by Coppola's wife, Eleanor) informs every scene and every frame, and the result is a film for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301115430", "630018627X", "0790701251", "6300183211", "6303686796", "6305363668", "079284646X", "6304935811", "0784011923", "6303953425", "0792836510", "6302822688", "B000003KHS", "630021639X", "6304119046", "B00003CXE6", "6302610702", "0792158261", "B000K7VHQE", "6303036570", "6303020089", "6303651488", "0800125762", "B004LWZW9W", "B00000JGEI", "0790705141", "6302360978", "6302415853", "0783107986", "B00005ATQA", "630336568X", "0790731975", "6305095566", "6300216500", "6301662954", "6302921058", "6300246965", "6300182878", "0800100832", "B00005JKEC", "6304286961", "B000062XM6", "0784011575", "630197154X", "B00004TYS8", "B00004WIDB", "6304414099", "0800116917", "6302517036", "0800199421", "6304259131", "0783202253", "6303109950", "6303313345", "B00006C7G9", "0792837312", "6302482712", "6300213986", "6303421563", "6304039549", "B000065U6Q", "B0000A36J1", "6300182770", "B00004CNR5", "6304025831", "6303422020", "0790748169", "0800132009"], "bought_together": ["6301115430", "0790701251"], "also_viewed": ["6303953425", "6305363668", "6305750750", "B00000J2KZ", "6303506291", "6303314015"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 172447}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6300214826", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EFVS37MRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Apocalypse Now [VHS]"}
{"description": "In retrospect, George Seaton's adaptation ofThe Country Girlseems like the movie that was made to prove that both Bing Crosby and Grace Kelly couldact. The tale of an alcoholic actor and singer (Crosby) and his long-suffering wife (Kelly) whose marriage is put to the test when he gets a second chance at stardom, Clifford Odets' drama is chock full of twists and turns designed to give actors a grueling workout, with its hidden secrets, tortured love story, and frank depiction of the horrors of alcohol abuse. Crosby and Kelly sank their teeth into the meaty roles with gusto (it helped that a rock-solid William Holden was there for each to spark off of), and both were showered with accolades that remained high points of their careers. Crosby was lauded with kudos for turning his charming persona inside-out, but it was Kelly who stole the show, possibly because at the time she was one of the hardest working women in show business. In 1954, the actress appeared in four films, including the Alfred Hitchcock classicsDial M for MurderandRear Window, and finally ascended to leading-lady status after her stellar supporting turns inHigh NoonandMogambo. In typical Hollywood fashion, though, it was only when Kelly shrouded her breathtaking beauty in plain clothes and a dowdy hairdo that she was taken seriously and awarded a Best Actress Oscar--one of the most highly contested ever, as she beat out comeback star Judy Garland's ferocious performance inA Star Is Born.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792837649", "B000003KE0", "0792839846", "6300215695", "6300215741", "0782008348", "0792110269", "6301586026"], "bought_together": ["0792837649"], "also_viewed": ["630197879X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 408172}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6300215660", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4120G3A9TKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Country Girl [VHS]"}

{"description": "The second--and most horrifying--of the fivePlanet of the Apesmovies, this film goes where few end-of-the-world movies ever dare tread. It's the far future. The mass of humanity has descended into speechless savagery, kept as captive animals by the talking apes who have inherited the world. Two astronauts from our time have landed here, retracing the path of their lost comrade, Captain Taylor (Charlton Heston). Unfortunately, they've landed in the middle of a grim situation. Warlike gorillas are preparing to eliminate the last shards of shattered human civilization, a degenerate, subterranean cult worshipping the greatest of all human achievements--the cobalt bomb. As well as rescuing Taylor, the two men have to stop the gorillas from wiping out humanity ... and stop humanity from fulfilling their self-appointed, self-destructive destiny. This is both thrill-a-minute science fiction and a surprisingly deep reflection on the human condition.

{"description": "A flawed but stylish adaptation of the Chester Gould comic strip by director Warren Beatty, who also stars in the title role. The minimalist plot involves a battalion of baddies who confront the intrepid detective in a series of strung-together vignettes. Al Pacino is a comedic if overblown standout as Big Boy Caprice, and Madonna simply smolders as aggressive blonde bombshell Breathless Mahoney. It matters not that the plot is Spartan, as this dazzling eye candy is much enhanced by Stephen Sondheim's songs, including the Academy Award-winning ditty, \"Sooner or Later (I Always Get My Man).\" Beatty took his cue from the source material and concentrated on the relationships between these people, whether strained, romantic, or hateful. The performances are subtle and more amusing than you would expect from such a visually bold picture. Shot in bright, primary colors, this also won Oscars for Best Art/Set Direction and Makeup (for those inventively hideous criminals).

{"description": "The ultimate tearjerker, this 1942 romance classic directed by Mervyn LeRoy (based on a novel by James Hilton) stars Ronald Colman as a British army officer suffering from amnesia after World War I. After falling in love with and marrying a dance-hall singer (Greer Garson), Colman's happy character begins a career as a writer and doesn't seem to mind that he doesn't remember who he is.

Henry Gordon). Flynn and Olivia de Havilland bring real tenderness to two-thirds of a romantic triangle (the other corner is the hero's brother, Patric Knowles). There's the fearsome siege of Chukoti, an unspeakable atrocity, and finally the foolhardy, inspired Charge at Balaklava. The camerawork and editing of that grand sequence never cease to astonish.

{"description": "Two of the juiciest roles in the American theater fall at the feet of Spencer Tracy and Fredric March, and both men make a meal of it.Inherit the Wind, based on the play by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee, is a slightly fictionalized account of the Scopes Monkey Trial, that galvanizing legal drama of the 1920s. When a young Tennessee teacher is prosecuted for teaching the theory of evolution in a public school, he receives unwanted public attention as well as the legal advice of a giant. Tracy plays the role based on Clarence Darrow, the eloquent defense attorney, and March storms his way through a part based on Williams Jennings Bryan, the failed presidential candidate (and famed orator) who prosecuted the case. Gene Kelly plays a character based on the acid-penned H.L. Mencken, reporting on the trial and caustically commenting on the absurdity of the human animal. Stanley (Judgment at Nuremberg) Kramer's direction is not especially subtle, but the verbal fireworks unleashed during the trial sequences are still stirring. Even the different styles of the actors are intriguing: March is all mannerism and false padding around the belly, while Tracy does his patented naturalistic grumbling. It would be nice if this story were a quaint period piece, but its issues and arguments keep reemerging in the headlines with each new generation.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792837967", "B0000EYUCK", "B0010YSD7W", "B002NZK5VO", "0800100832", "B004FQX5B6", "6301628454", "6303402070", "630438100X", "6302353785", "6300215962", "0792838556", "B003MG6FJY", "630197803X", "630396155X", "1555265952", "6303057225", "B000A1KF8Q", "6301412796", "6302098424", "B000EO7AIC", "6301647734", "630197638X"], "bought_together": ["0792837967"], "also_viewed": ["B003B3NV6I"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 260813}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6302120624", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51D8EEZ5TZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Inherit the Wind [VHS]"}

{"description": "F.W. Murnau changed the name and ghastly appearance of his villain, but this unauthorized version of Bram Stoker'sDraculacouldn't fool the Stoker estate, and it became the center of a lawsuit that almost resulted in its complete destruction. Thankfully this masterpiece survives (though in a somewhat altered form), for despite its liberties with the novel, this 1921 horror classic remains the most beautiful and resonant interpretation of Stoker. Though the plot remains essentially the same--naive real-estate clerk Thomas (Gustav von Wangenheim) is sent abroad to finalize a sale with the nocturnal Count Orlock (the hideous-looking Max Schreck), who imprisons Thomas and travels to England to claim Thomas's beautiful young wife, Ellen (Greta Schroder), as his own--the visual realization creates a very different story. Schreck plays the vampire as a grotesque demon, with his claw-like hands, bald head and sharp, bat-like ears, and he rises from his coffin with an supernatural stiffness, like a tent pole pulled upright. When the eerily empty ghost ship carrying his coffin arrives in Thomas's home port, a river of rats pours out and spreads through the town like a plague. Perhaps the most noticeable changes from the novel are the absence of Van Helsing and the richer realization of Ellen, the would-be victim, whose innate sensibility and solemn spirituality give her a spooky connection with the vampire. With his stark, symbol-laden visual scheme and sacrificial conclusion, Murnau creates a more mythic tale than any subsequent adaptation of Stoker's novel.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000067JAW", "6300183084", "6303626424", "6300183092"], "also_viewed": ["630526323X", "B00HRUQ8X4"]}, "price": 24.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 311149}, "asin": "6302194296", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VWHHY3ZJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Nosferatu [VHS]"}

{"description": "A potboiler featuring a demented caretaker and a seemingly hapless suburban family, this isThe Nannyof the 1990s. However, it is much more predictable than that 1965 Bette Davis psychodrama, and more graphic. It works only because Rebecca De Mornay makes us intensely uncomfortable as the disturbed au pair who wants to take care of much more than her employer's well-being.Annabella Sciorra plays the perfect mother of a flawless family. Her obstetrician, however, is less than wonderful, having enjoyed her examination much more than he should have. When she files sexual harassment charges against the repugnant doctor, he loses face--literally--after shooting himself in the head. Several months later, an ideal nanny shows up at her home. You guessed it--she's the doc's widow.The movie follows a tried and true formula, with the audience in on everything. However, the story does surprise us in intense and intimate ways. The visit to the obstetrician is one of the creepiest moments in the film. You definitely hear the voice of writer Amanda Silver in a plot concerned with the vulnerabilities of a family, a newborn, a marriage.Since we know so much up front, there is an overall lack of inventiveness in the plot machinations. It may not jolt us, but De Mornay does. It's unsettling to watch someone who appears so attractive and who behaves so kindly suddenly reveal hideous psychopathic tendencies. Restraining herself from going over the top, she instead oozes such malevolence you'll want to shudder.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302096227", "6300988767", "6302088607", "6303514723", "6301961366"], "bought_together": ["6302096227"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 180977}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6302450187", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JEJR9N62L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hand That Rocks the Cradle [VHS]"}
{"description": "Roger Moore was introduced as James Bond in this 1973 action movie featuring secret agent 007. More self-consciously suave and formal than predecessor Sean Connery, he immediately reestablished Bond as an uncomplicated and wooden fellow for the feel-good '70s. This film also marks a deviation from the more character-driven stories of the Connery years, a deliberate shift to plastic action (multiple chases, bravura stunts) that made the franchise more of a comic book or machine. If that's not depressing enough, there's even a good British director on board, Guy Hamilton (Force 10 from Navarone).

In 1899, the pint-sized newsboys delivering the New York papers go on strike against the unfair practices of news magnates Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst. The production is heavy on kiddie humor, although Christian Bale (the child star of Spielberg'sEmpire of the Sun) is charismatic as one of the older leaders of the revolt. The adult stars don't fare as well, with Robert Duvall doddering around as Pulitzer and Ann-Margret and Bill Pullman doing decorative duty.

{"description": "Charlie Chaplin is in glorious form in this legendary satire of the mechanized world. As a factory worker driven bonkers by the soulless momentum of work, Chaplin executes a series of slapstick routines around machines, including a memorable encounter with an automatic feeding apparatus. The pantomime is triumphant, but Chaplin also draws a lively relationship between the Tramp and a street gamine. She's played by Paulette Goddard, then Chaplin's wife and probably his best leading lady (here and inThe Great Dictator). The film's theme gave the increasingly ambitious writer-director a chance to speak out about social issues, as well as indulging in the bittersweet quality of pathos that critics were already calling \"Chaplinesque.\" In 1936, Chaplin was still holding out against spoken dialogue in films, but he did use a synchronized soundtrack of sound effects and his own music, a score that includes one of his most famous melodies, \"Smile.\" And late in the film, Chaplin actually does speak--albeit in a garbled gibberish song, a rebuke to modern times in talking pictures.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["630256185X", "6302561817", "6302561825", "6302561949", "6302561833", "6302561957", "B00004TX2C", "6302561965"], "bought_together": ["630256185X"], "also_viewed": ["6302561825"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 301935}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6302561841", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71W9ZSV0YWL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Modern Times [VHS]"}

The absurdly long film is filled out with some fairly crude humor, such as the sight of Geoffrey Holder taking a whiff of Grace Jones's underwear. Yet Hudlin and Murphy also strain for a veneer of elegance and sophistication. Wanting to play it both ways, they end up with nothing.

{"description": "Throughout his long, wandering, often distinguished career Francis Ford Coppola has made many films that are good and fine, many more that are flawed but undeniably interesting, and a handful of duds that are worth viewing if only because his personality is so flagrantly absent. Yet he is and always shall be known as the man who directed theGodfatherfilms, a series that has dominated and defined their creator in a way perhaps no other director can understand. Coppola has never been able to leave them alone, whether returning after 15 years to make a trilogy of the diptych, or re-editing the first two films into chronological order for a separate video release asThe Godfather Saga. The films are our very own Shakespearean cycle: they tell a tale of a vicious mobster and his extended personal and professional families (once the stuff of righteous moral comeuppance), and they dared to present themselves with an epic sweep and an unapologetically tragic tone. Murder, it turned out, was a serious business. The first film remains a towering achievement, brilliantly cast and conceived. The entry of Michael Corleone into the family business, the transition of power from his father, the ruthless dispatch of his enemies--all this is told with an assurance that is breathtaking to behold. And it turned out to be merely prologue; two years laterThe Godfather, Part IIbalanced Michael's ever-greater acquisition of power and influence during the fall of Cuba with the story of his father's own youthful rise from immigrant slums. The stakes were higher, the story's construction more elaborate, and the isolated despair at the end wholly earned. (Has there ever been a cinematic performance greater than Al Pacino's Michael, so smart and ambitious, marching through the years into what he knows is his own doom with eyes open and hungry?)The Godfather, Part IIIwas mostly written off as an attempted cash-in, but it is a wholly worthy conclusion, less slow than autumnally patient and almost merciless in the way it brings Michael's past sins crashing down around him even as he tries to redeem himself.--Bruce Reid", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302054982", "6304025831", "6301792734", "6305123616", "6302383455", "B000059HFB", "6300271617", "B0000DI87S", "6304233639", "0792151712", "B00005PJ6V", "6303029027", "6300183211", "B000C20VRS", "6301574117", "0792158261", "6300214826", "B0000A36J1", "0790731975", "0783222149", "6304994540", "630354231X", "6304508611", "B00011CZRE", "6301977742", "B00003CXOO", "B00005NOHP", "B00000K3AN", "6301963911", "B000059HGY", "B000005QWI", "B00005NKW1", "6301628454", "6302822688", "6304285116", "B00000K2SO", "B000054OW2", "6302909023", "6302305934", "B00000FZCU", "0792845684", "6304071876", "B00005ATQA", "6305169187", "630268644X", "B00004W9C7", "B00004CIOV", "0800116917", "B00000K2SC", "B000067IXQ"], "also_viewed": ["6302383455", "B0019L770A", "B000003KHS", "0792174909", "B00EN09FKO", "630021639X", "B000059HFB", "6304467567", "0792152808", "B00BBND56G", "B002J40X0C", "6301792734", "0800116917", "B00000J2KZ", "0793558107", "B0000DI87S", "B0019L21GA", "0792158261", "6305363668", "6300183211", "0684836475", "6304443064", "6302158176", "B000930DLO", "B00006AL1C", "0792151712", "B000028U3S", "B00AEBB9DM", "B0018U250O", "B00AQJ8MLY", "6305123616", "B006TTC5DQ", "B00000F3SE", "B007STBUIW", "B002M2Z3BA", "B00J2R3VZI", "B00ITAQ2MS", "B0071JADFU", "B001UCJVJI", "B000LPS4BG", "B001FB55H6", "B002VWNIAY", "B008Y1YK0I", "B005FDXT32", "B005LAIIJY", "B000K6TOK6", "B00E9PMMX0", "B00KCTG4PO", "B00H9KKKAY"]}, "price": 30.59, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 105101}, "asin": "6302610702", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41yBN5Ti01L._SX300_.jpg", "title": "The Godfather Collection [VHS]"}

{"description": "This subtle, existential character study of an emotionally distant outcast (Nicholson) forced to confront his past failures remains an intimate cornerstone of American '70s cinema. Written and directed with remarkable restraint by Bob Rafelson, the film is the result of a short-lived partnership between the filmmaker and Nicholson--the first was the zany formalist exercise,Head,while the equally impressiveKing of Marvin GardensfollowedFive Easy Pieces.Quiet and full of long, controlled takes, this film draws its strength from the acutely detailed, nonjudgmental observations of its complex protagonist, Robert Dupea--an extremely crass and frustrated oil worker, and failed child pianist hiding from his past in Texas. Dupea spends his life drinking beer and sleeping with (and cheating on) his annoying but adoring Tammy Wynette-wannabe girlfriend, but when he learns that his father is dying in Washington State, he leaves. After the film transforms into a spirited road movie, and arrives at the eccentric upper-class Dupea family mansion, it becomes apparent that leaving is what Dupea does best--from his problems, fears, and those who love him. Nicholson gives a difficult yet masterful performance in an unlikable role, one that's full of ambiguity and requires violent shifts in acting style. Several sequences--such as his stopping traffic to play piano, or his famous verbal duels with a cranky waitress over a chicken-salad sandwich--are Nicholson landmarks. Yet, it's the quieter moments, when Dupea tries miserably to communicate and reconcile with his dying father, where the actor shows his real talent--and by extension, shows us the wounded little boy that lurks in the shell of the man Dupea has become.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302752329", "6302752337", "1558808590", "6300216500", "6303111874", "6300267865", "6301955293", "0800124693", "6301798759", "6303430910", "6304698305", "6300147355", "6304508557", "6301734734", "630018627X", "630442972X", "6305012792", "0783217528", "6303364772", "6302816416", "6302308208"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 152600}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.73, "brand": "", "asin": "6302757096", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HFH4VBEML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Five Easy Pieces [VHS]"}
{"description": "A second look reveals some exit-wound-size holes in the plot, but there's nothing second-rate about the performances or the pacing of this serial-killer whodunit written and directed by Bruce Robinson (Withnail and I,The Killing Fields). Andy Garcia plays a cop whose failed marriage and recent spell with the bottle has brought him upstate from L.A  to live near his half-sister (Kathy Baker) and one-time partner (Lance Henriksen). But he has barely unpacked his bags when a routine homicide call takes him to a spectacular local dump. There, amid heaps of detective-movie typewriters and colorful bags of garbage, he kicks up a severed hand. This leads him to reopen an unsolved psycho-killer file--codename \"Jennifer\"--that in turn reopens some old sores in the department. In the noir tradition, Garcia falls hard for his key witness, who happens to be blind (Uma Thurman, playing against the lusterPulp Fictionwould Monroe-ize two years later) and in one stroke puts her life, and his career, in exquisite jeopardy. The plot weaves in and out of logic, but the dialogue track keeps you leaning in for the details.

{"description": "A heartwarming story of mistaken identity and idealism, director Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters) takes on the political establishment in this fresh, funny comedy. Kevin Kline (Sophie's Choice,A Fish Called Wanda) plays Dave Kovic, a sweet man with a big heart running an employment agency. Dave happens to be a dead ringer for the current president of the United States, and he hires himself out as an impersonator for parties and mall openings. When the real president has a stroke while in bed with an aide, his ambitious chief of staff (Frank Langella) decides to hold onto the White House by appealing to Dave's sense of patriotism and having him pose as the president. Soon, however, Dave is running the country in a way contrary to what the chief of staff would like, even as he finds himself falling in love with the unsuspecting first lady (Sigourney Weaver). The movie's unbridled optimism is its best asset, and it makes this a pleasant comedy worth seeing.--Robert Lane", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305132666"], "bought_together": ["6305132666"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 306692}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6302928540", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51642DN0CHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dave [VHS]"}
{"description": "R&eacute;gis Wargnier's 1992 Oscar winner for Best Foreign Film is a bit like watching paint dry, despite its exotic locale and lead performance by the legendary Catherine Deneuve (Belle de Jour,The Umbrellas of Cherbourg). Deneuve plays a wealthy French landowner, born and raised in Indochina, from 1930 until 1955, the year of a Communist takeover.

{"description": "Tina Turner, that dynamic diva of pop/soul/R&B; from the '60s to the '90s, sings like a woman whose life story is every bit as rough and tough as her voice. AndWhat's Love Got to Do With It, based on her autobiographical account (inI, Tina, written with Kurt Loder) of her years under the iron fist of her abusive husband and musical partner/Svengali Ike, is further proof of what we've always known about Tina: She's what you call a survivor. The movie is sort of the Disney version of Tina Turner's story--a glossy but thoroughly enjoyable, old-fashioned showbiz biopic with laughs, tears, great music, and outrageous (but faithful) period decor, costumes, makeup, and hairstyles. Our Heroine triumphs not only over the rigorous demands of her career in the music business, but finally manages to bust out of her troubled, violent marriage as well and become her own person.

The running gag that holds this string of episodic misadventures together is Peppermint Patty's futile attempts at explaining how to make Easter eggs to Marcy. Highlights of this rather surreal Peanuts outing include Snoopy's dancing with little bunny rabbits inside a kaleidoscope, Sally heading to the mall to purchase a pair of platform shoes (this video was made in 1974), and Woodstock's lavishly equipped bachelor-pad birdhouse.

{"description": "Seven decades before Michael Crichton borrowed the title of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic adventure tale,The Lost Worldwas the movie sensation of 1925. (The film is not to be confused with Steven Spielberg's sequel toJurassic Park.) Just as Spielberg's dinosaur thrillers would advance the technology of computer-generated spectacle, Doyle's classic story provided a perfect opportunity to exploit the illusions made possible by stop-motion animation. Eight years before he stunned audiences with the amazing special effects ofKing Kong, pioneering stop-motion animator Willis O'Brien created the dinosaur stars of this classic silent-film fantasy. Following Doyle's plot, the film plays like a dress rehearsal forKing Kongand establishes a now-familiar scenario: Wallace Beery plays a visionary scientist who returns to the remote South African plateau where he'd earlier discovered a jungle haven of prehistoric creatures.  Determined to introduce this discovery to the world, he returns to London with a captive brontosaurus, which later escapes and goes on a destructive rampage through the city.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["630497342X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 617027}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6303038786", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/214HP8TDKRL.jpg", "title": "Lost World [VHS]"}
{"description": "llicit, in 1931, gave Barbara Stanwyck her first starring role. She plays a young woman, Anne Vincent, who doesn't want to marry her boyfriend. She wants to keep living in sin, because that's what they've been doing and she's been thoroughly enjoying it, and because she believes marriage kills romance, and also because she doesn't want to become a man's property. As events unfold, and she finds herself pressured into marriage, it becomes obvious that most of her fears were justified. This is very much the kind of movie that the tightening up of the Hollywood Production Code in 1934 was intended to stop, with its guilt-free attitude towards sex and its very independent heroine. Stanwyck is delightful - funny and feisty and sweet and likeable at the same time. James Rennie is OK as her boyfriend, who turns out to be rather conventional. Ricardo Cortez is suave and slightly sinister as one of Anne's ex-boyfriends who is still intermittently pursuing her. Joan Blondell, as so often, plays the heroine's best friends and, as always, she lights the screen. Charles Butterworth plays an amusing perpetually drunken friend, the kind of role that is often annoying in these early sound pictures but Butterworth is quite wonderful, with a superb very dry wit and an air of dazed benevolence. Illicit is always entertaining and provides a nice mix of humour and romance. It's also nice to see a movie which doesn't make judgments on any of its characters. Even the \"other woman\" isn't demonised.", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302041090", "B004DK5E8G", "6302208866", "6302682568", "B004DK9J7S"], "bought_together": ["6302041090"], "also_viewed": ["B00478ED18", "B001QFFBAM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 515031}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 30.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6303050166", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GGC7XP18L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Illicit [VHS]"}

{"description": "Few actresses have captivated the camera as powerfully as Dorothy  Dandridge inCarmen Jones. Her polished beauty plays in irresistible contrast to her title character's leonine sexuality and fluid emotions; a man can't decide from moment to moment if he wants to save her from doom, build her a castle, or never let her out of bed. Of course, that's the problem with the boys in this semi-experimental adaptation of Bizet's opera,Carmen. Straight-arrow Joe (a strapping Harry Belafonte), an obedient corporal on a Southern military base during World War&nbsp;II, is all set to go to flight school and marry his hometown sweetie, Cindy Lou (Olga James), when his troublemaking sergeant orders him to accompany Carmen to a civilian court. In short order, Joe is swept up in Carmen's carnal anarchy and her craving for  release from lousy options in life. An impulsive act of violence ensures that Joe's future is gone forever, putting Carmen in the difficult position of destroying their relationship to save him. Oscar Hammerstein II took  Bizet's music in 1943 and rewrote the book and lyrics. The result is largely a smashing success with a few missteps (the bullfighter in Bizet's piece becomes a heavyweight boxer here, which breaks up a certain grace in the  story) and a couple of perfect stretches (the long prelude to Carmen and Joe's first embrace, set on Carmen's home turf). Despite the fact that both Dandridge and Belafonte were singers, their vocal performances were  dubbed by LeVern Hutcherson and Marilyn Horne. (Yes, it is a little disconcerting to hear another voice come out of the more familiar Belafonte's mouth.) Otto Preminger directed with his usual eye on economy of action and production, as the numerous musical numbers tend to be shot in lengthy, single,  carefully choreographed takes. The result can be a little visually static at times, but the passion behind the singing pulls everything through.--Tom  Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 467747}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.65, "brand": "", "asin": "6303102425", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TGP1S6K4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Carmen Jones [VHS]"}

In the hopes of finding the treasure to buy back their houses, the Goonies embark on their quest through underground passages, aboard pirate ships, and behind waterfalls.

Sister Frances rebels against a sanctimonious  bishop, Rosemary defies edicts against sex, and others leave the convent for love and to  confront the changing times.  Starring Academy Award  winner Brenda Fricker (My Left  Foot), BRIDES OF CHRIST captures the restless desperation of a reclusive society and  their encounters with the outside world.", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 339063}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 37.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6303215440", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CJKMYHM6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Brides of Christ [VHS]"}

The first-time teacher leads the uniformed men and women to an appreciation of Shakespeare, but he still has to grapple with his own problems with commitment and responsibility.

{"description": "Often mentioned as a contender for the title of Worst Movie Ever Made,Glen or Glenda?(a.k.a.I Changed My Sex, a.k.a.I Led Two Lives, a.k.a.He or She) remains Ed Wood's weirdest film--and, for the director ofPlan 9 from Outer Space, that's saying something. YetGlen or Glenda?goes way beyond camp, into some unique zone of demented personal expression, an essay/collage/autobiography that is no less fascinating just because it comes from a second-rate mind. Wood himself, under the pseudonym Daniel Davis, plays a transvestite struggling to reveal his tendencies to his wife (the toneless Dolores Fuller, Wood's missus in real life). Mixed in with this exploitation story is a ton of irrelevant stock footage, as well as disconnected glimpses of B&eacute;la Lugosi bellowing at the audience; Lugosi's dialogue is a tapestry of non sequiturs and portentous warnings. The behind-the-scenes creation ofGlen or Glenda?forms part of the action ofEd Wood, Tim Burton's affectionate tribute to the B-movie master. Wood himself was a transvestite, which accounts for the cracked sincerity ofGlen or Glenda?; the passion for angora sweaters is real, not a fluffy plot device.

{"description": "Jim Jarmusch's 1991 ensemble comedy turns a gimmick into a revelation. The story begins in Los Angeles one evening at 7:07 p.m. A talent agent (Gena Rowlands) gets into the back of a taxi driven by a sullen, chain-smoking young woman (Winona Ryder), and over the course of their bumpy conversation, Rowlands's character becomes convinced that the cabby would be perfect for a particular part in a movie. Meanwhile, at that very moment, taxi drivers in New York, Paris, Rome, and Helsinki are all having unique encounters with a variety of fares, breaking through that invisible social barrier between the front and back seats of their cars, often to absurd or touching effect. Among them are cabby Roberto Benigni's ranting confessions to a priest, Armin Mueller-Stahl's relinquishing of the wheel to a stunned Giancarlo Esposito, and Isaach De Bankol&eacute;'s relentless discussion of sight and sex with an angry, blind woman (Beatrice Dalle). What emerges is a chain of brief intimacies (not always welcomed by the characters), like a number of matches lit simultaneously across the globe, flickering brightly for a few short moments.

Fantasy and drama combine in the story of a teenager known as Powder for his snow-white skin. Powder is introduced into a tiny Texas community after spending his entire life in his grandparents' basement. He's a wise genius, but an outcast, alienated by those who misunderstand and fear him. When a schoolmaster (Mary Steenburgen) and science teacher (Jeff Goldblum) discover that Powder has a capacity for empathic insight and possesses the power to control electricity, the unusual boy becomes a tragic Christ-like figure--peaceful, prophetic, and perhaps too good to survive in the real world. In telling this heartfelt story,Powderstruggles to be all things to all viewers--equal partsE.T.andThe Elephant Man--which compromises its overall impact.

{"description": "John Frankenheimer scored his first success with this, his third theatrical feature and his second collaboration with producer-star Burt Lancaster (they would make five films together all told). Lancaster delivers an angry, brooding performance as real-life criminal Robert Stroud, a violent killer who, while in solitary confinement, became an internationally recognized authority on birds and their diseases. Based on the book by Thomas E. Gaddis, Frankenheimer creates a portrait of a withdrawn, antisocial prisoner who discovers his own potential after reluctantly rescuing a wounded sparrow from a storm and nursing it back to health. Lancaster's quiet portrayal comes from his eyes and restrained body language, earning him his second Oscar nomination. Costars Telly Savalas (as the talkative \"neighbor\" from the cell next door) and Thelma Ritter (as his controlling mother) were also nominated, but Frankenheimer's sensitive direction draws equally fine performances from Neville Brand, playing against type as the prison guard who slowly befriends Stroud, and Karl Malden as the tough warden whose ideas of confinement and punishment prompted Stroud to follow-up his studies of birds with a treatise on prison reform. This somber, subdued tale offers no truly happy ending, but it does present a powerful portrait of one man's efforts to earn back his dignity and respect in the worst of conditions.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301973259", "1558807780", "0790743531", "B000M5BRX2", "6302909023", "6301797957", "6301967410", "0790743213", "6301973410", "6302413435", "630196733X", "6301976061", "6302226899", "0783222955", "6301976932", "6301798503", "6304039530", "6301975987", "0790733935", "6304196911", "B000005XPV"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 391087}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.97, "brand": "", "asin": "6304111363", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EM12HWZ5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Birdman of Alcatraz [VHS]"}

That's the impossible mission accomplished by director Brian De Palma, star-coproducer Tom Cruise, and the crack team ofMission: Impossible.

But nothing is what it seems. The nail-biting set piece--always a signature of director De Palma (Carrie,The Untouchables)--in which Cruise is lowered from the ceiling to retrieve information from a computer in a high-security vault--is an instant classic. But perhaps even more impressive, at least in retrospect, is a flashback sequence in which two characters attempt to reconstruct a series of events from multiple points of view.

Please control that gag reflex for this does work remarkably well, and though entirely unnecessary and certainly not a complement to the original, it doesn't tarnish its good name.--Keith Simanton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302526574", "0788812408", "0788810634", "0788802194", "6305229449", "6303314015", "6304401132", "0788805533", "155890641X", "6304290888", "6302787068", "6302961572", "6305940932", "0788806270", "0788812807", "6303983812", "6304089767", "078881172X", "6304089201", "6302320402", "6300275310", "6304400551", "6300274268", "0788811002", "B0000524CZ", "6302158095", "0788803743", "6305326940", "6303036813", "B00004R99N", "B00003CX7L", "0788805843", "6304500831", "B00003CXQX", "6305319138", "B00005T7H6", "B000035Z2S", "6303929338", "6302642248", "B000JBWWRO", "6304978286", "6303534422", "B00005K9OA", "6300274195", "6304401736", "6300274608", "0788812440", "B00005RRG3", "0788812181", "B00007LVCT", "B00005RDVV", "B00000ICHA", "0788809806", "6300276554", "B000063V8N", "B00003CXHR", "6302426200", "6303122647", "6304100507", "B00005JKX3", "B00005JL95", "6302178924", "B00001YX9H", "B0009SUS4Q", "B00008X5J6", "B0000E32WB", "6304155972", "6303442447", "1558906150", "6305942285", "B000001M2I", "B00005LOUS", "B0000AQZYM", "6304873441", "6304492952", "B000028U3S", "6304400225", "B00003CWPW", "B00004REYY", "B00000J2JB", "B003XQRYYS", "B00000J2JA", "6303392350", "6302481805", "B0002YLCHE", "B00006953H", "B00007AJLF", "B00005T7H1", "6303439357", "B00008Y47S", "B0000CABJ2", "B00016JF2W", "B0001I55VK", "6304400381", "6302642302", "B000001M31", "1558901892", "6303224407", "B000009CTR"], "bought_together": ["6302526574", "0788812408"], "also_viewed": ["6302526574", "6303314015", "6305940932", "0788810634", "0788806270", "6302787068", "6304400551", "0788812408", "6304401132", "6303036813", "6302320402", "0788802194", "6302642248", "078881172X", "6305229449", "155890641X", "6304500831", "6300274195", "0788805533", "6304089201", "B00007LVCT", "6303983812", "0788812807", "B00003CX7L", "6304290888", "6303929338", "6304978286", "B00004R99N", "6302961572", "B0007KTBIU", "6305326940", "0788805843", "B0000AQZYM", "B0000524CZ", "B000035Z2S", "6300274268", "6304089767", "6302178924", "0788811002", "6302426200", "6300275310", "B0000E32WB", "B00005T7H6", "B00005JL95", "6303534422", "6304400225", "B000063V8N", "B00005JKX3", "0788812440", "6304873441", "B00003CXQX", "B00005JKDQ", "6304401736", "B00005RDVV", "B0002YLCH4", "6303315305", "B000BAVLYS", "0788810448", "6304100507"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 103465}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.35, "brand": "", "asin": "6304501153", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512QNVMW6JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Disney's Beauty and the Beast - The Enchanted Christmas [VHS]"}
{"description": "Plot is a meaningless term when trying to describeLost Highway. Here, more or less, is what happens:  A noise-jazz saxophonist (Bill Pullman) suspects his wife (Patricia Arquette) of infidelity. Meanwhile, someone is breaking into their house and videotaping them while they sleep. The wife is murdered and Pullman is convicted of the crime. Then, in prison, he transmogrifies into a young mechanic (Balthazar Getty) who is subsequently released, since, after all, he's not the guy they convicted. Getty goes back to his life and meets a local gangster's moll, who happens to be played by Patricia Arquette... but none of this has much to do with what the movie is really about. Dreams are what intrigues director David Lynch. Not friendly, happy dreams; his dreams whisper that what we think is real is just something we made up, something to keep ourselves from falling into chaos. Characters are fragments. Events happen not because they make sense, but because deep down wewantthese things to happen. Of course, in Lynch's dreams, as in our waking lives, getting what we want is not always pleasant. In the movie's best moments, you really have no idea what you're seeing. The screen is a big rectangle of color and shadow, but what it represents, well, it could be anything. And yet, in those moments, you've been given just enough hints of place, character, and story that these elusive images elicit a genuine dread, a sense that you might not want to see this, yet you can't look away; a sense that we are living on borrowed time, that something is fiercely askew in our psyches. As a whole,Lost Highwayis a failure: much of it is padded, gratuitous, and indulgent and pointless cameos bog down an already sluggish narrative. Yet within that failure are moments worth more than the entirety of most successful movies.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009RRUKW", "B000067DGJ", "6303018351", "6303515304", "6300214044"], "bought_together": ["B0009RRUKW", "6303018351"], "also_viewed": ["B007NYDVV6"]}, "price": 29.87, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 372956}, "asin": "6304510861", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/717FGE5YK8L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Lost Highway [VHS]"}
{"description": "Catherine Deneuve and David Bowie are rich, beautiful, and oh-so chic as denizens of the night. Dressed in sleek outfits and stylish sunglasses, they haunt rock & roll clubs on the prowl for young blood, whom they bring home to their impossibly luxurious mansion for a late-night snack.  Being a vampire never looked more sexy, but there's a price: Bowie starts to age so fast he wrinkles up in the waiting room of a doctor's (Susan Sarandon) office. The agelessly elegant Deneuve, evoking Delphine Seyrig's Countess Bathory fromDaughters of Darkness, is perfectly cast as a millenniums-old bloodsucker who seeks a new mate in Sarandon and seduces her in a sunlight-bathed afternoon of smooth, silky sex. Tony Scott's (Ridley's brother) directorial debut, adapted from the Whitley Strieber novel, revises the vampire myth with Egyptian inflections and removes all references to garlic and crosses and wooden stakes--these bloodsuckers can even walk around in the daylight--but the ties between blood and sex are as strong as ever. Scott's background as an award-winning commercial director is evident in every richly textured frame and his densely interwoven editing, but the moody atmosphere comes at the expense of dramatic urgency. At times the film is so languid it becomes mired in its hazy, impeccably designed visual style. In its own way,The Hungeris the perfect vampire film for the '80s, all poise and attitude and surface beauty. Sarandon talks candidly about the film in the documentaryThe Celluloid Closet.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000I1GO"], "bought_together": ["B00000I1GO"], "also_viewed": ["6302491908"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 278584}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6304509103", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51793HKSJ8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hunger [VHS]"}
{"description": "You have a classic tale full of drama, passion, and adventure. A tale of universal archetypes that speak to everyone. A tale that has remained unfailingly popular for thousands of years. Why not spice it up with a wacky mechanical owl? Such was the thinking behindClash of the Titans. Maggie Smith, Laurence Olivier, and Harry Hamlin (one of these things is not like the others...) star in a toga-ripper about a valiant hero, capricious immortals, and lots and lots of giant stop-action monsters. Perseus (Hamlin) is the favored son of the god Zeus (Olivier), but he has unwittingly ticked off the sea goddess Thetis (Smith). Just to make things worse, Perseus falls in love with the lovely Princess Andromeda, who used to be engaged to Thetis's son. Soon Perseus is off on one quest after another, with Zeus helping, Thetis hindering, and lots of innocent bystanders getting stabbed, drowned, and squished. Of course, the whole thing is just an excuse to show as much of Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion animation as possible, and good thing too. It's an old technique, but it still looks pretty darn cool, and it means the cast can just relax and do a bunch of reaction shots. Don't use this one to study for that big classical mythology exam, but if you just turn your brain off and enjoy the Kraken, it's pretty good fun.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001DB6J50", "6302182522", "0767847431", "6303257674", "6300216500", "6302360978", "6304071876", "6302098424", "6300146383", "6301976061", "0792839846", "B00023NRSM", "6301163796", "1572524421", "0790743159"], "also_viewed": ["6302182522"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 314532}, "asin": "6304546335", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5183JBADM8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Clash of the Titans [VHS]"}

Garofalo plays Marcy, aide to dim Massachusetts senator McGlory (Jay O. Sanders). Denis Leary is  appropriately slimy as a fellow aide. The senator and Nick dispatch Marcy to the remote (and fictitious)  Irish town of Ballinagra, where she's supposed to unearth relatives to use in the senator's PR campaign. Along the way, Marcy not only encounters the eccentric locals, but finds herself in the maelstrom  of the town's annual matchmaking festival. The single Marcy inadvertently catches the eye of the movie's  eponymous matchmaker Dermot (a captivating Milo O'Shea). Dermot senses sparks between Marcy and  the equally cynical, recently returned local boy, Sean (David O'Hara), once a successful journalist who's  returned home to work on a book. The intimacies of the small town, the relationships between the locals, and the dialogue are credible and engaging. Look for beautiful cinematography and music, too. Also notable is the movie's ability to convey the feel of a foreign film while injecting humor that's both sarcastically American and yet Irish in trademark.--N.F.

It was released in 1970 when protest against the Vietnam War still raged at home and abroad, and many critics and moviegoers struggled to reconcile current events with the movie's glorification of Gen. George S. Patton as a crazy-brave genius of World War II.How could a movie so huge in scope and so fascinated by its subject be considered an anti-war film? The simple truth is that it's not--Patton is less about World War II than about the rise and fall of a man whose life was literally defined by war, and who felt lost and lonely without the grand-scale pursuit of an enemy. George C. Scott embodies his role so fully, so convincingly, that we can't help but be drawn to and fascinated by Patton as a man who is simultaneously bound for hell and glory. The film's opening monologue alone is a masterful display of acting and character analysis, and everything that follows is sheer brilliance on the part of Scott and director Franklin J. Schaffner.Filmed on an epic scale at literally dozens of European locations, Patton does not embrace war as a noble pursuit, nor does it deny the reality of war as a breeding ground for heroes. Through the awesome achievement of Scott's performance and the film's grand ambition, Patton shows all the complexities of a man who accepted his role in life and (like Scott) played it to the hilt.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303057225", "0800132009", "B0007TKNGA", "6304071876", "6302909023", "6301966317", "6300181472", "B000059HGY", "6300214826", "6300268748", "079213690X", "630407185X", "B00000K3AN", "6301797906", "6301115430", "079284646X", "0790701251", "0790752395", "6302529441", "0783221347", "B00000F13T", "6300216543", "B00006C7G9", "6304151306", "B00005LL26", "630018224X", "6301971809", "6301965817", "6300181340", "630442972X", "6300988473", "630105573X", "0783216084", "6301777867", "B00003CXTF", "B000003KDG", "6303020089", "6301969251", "B000003KHS", "B00004CNR5", "6301662954", "0784011923", "B00000FZCU", "6300215962", "0800100832", "1569942072", "B00003CXE6", "6300271846", "6300181154", "630274721X", "0790734079", "0764004638", "0800125762", "6302415853", "6301976622", "630018627X", "B00005A1VG", "B000007OY0", "B000068TSI", "B00005ATQA", "0800116917", "6300216802", "6303696813", "6300267830", "0790758474", "0792116887", "0783235607", "630197154X", "B00005Q4GY", "B0000048YO", "6302224330", "0800106032", "6303824358", "B000056BRF", "6304457278", "6300267938", "6300182304"], "bought_together": ["6303057225"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 219212}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.74, "brand": "", "asin": "6304935811", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/418V1BMMHEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Patton [VHS]"}
{"description": "Nothing that British filmmaker Michael Winterbottom made beforeWelcome to Sarajevo(includingButterfly KissandJude) suggested the clarifying rage of this 1997 film, which is based on the experiences of British journalist Michael Nicholson while on assignment in Bosnia. Made emotionally numb by the savagery and insanity of Serbian aggression on Sarajevo and surrounding towns and countryside, reporter Michael Henderson (Stephen Dillane in a remarkable performance) awakens to the plight of one orphanage and particularly to that of a girl whom he promises to rescue. Henderson's efforts lead to a harrowing bus journey to (temporary) protection for some of the kids (others, quite shockingly, are carried off en route by Serb marauders), and then a second, even more dangerous good deed to finish what he started. The film's dimensions go well beyond that story line, however, as Winterbottom re-creates the gallows-humor culture of international correspondents in a blighted region, as well as the nightmare of the Sarajevo siege. Most savage of all, however, is the director's use of news clips in a pointed attack on the West's refusal to deal with the slaughter and outrages in Bosnia at their peak. The supporting cast might look like a bunch of famous names (Kerry Fox, Marisa Tomei) used decorously to attract attention to the film, but in fact everyone is very good, especially Woody Harrelson as an American journalist whose entrance in the story is one of the most memorable in recent history.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_viewed": ["1572523026", "6304520182", "1573629065"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 438482}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6304938225", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51S46F5ACML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Welcome to Sarajevo [VHS]"}
{"description": "During the 10 years betweenNight of the Living DeadandDawn of the Dead, director George Romero had a string of box-office flops--some of which were actually quite good. For example,there'sThe Crazies, in which a military plane carrying biological-warfare agents crashes near Evans City, Pennsylvania. The virus gets into the town's water supply and has two effects on the infected: death or irreversible insanity. The military moves in to contain the situation, but the local populace regards the army as a menacing force and things rapidly spin out of control. Soon the highly contagious virus infects the whole town and the soldiers as well, while a government scientist races to find an antidote.The Craziesfeatures some great set pieces as the virus spreads: a little old lady smiles sweetly and stabs a soldier to death with a knitting needle; a young woman placidly sweeps with a broom while soldiers and locals have a bloody firefight around her; a soldier swings his rifle wildly at his comrades until they shoot him.Made in the shadow of both Vietnam and Watergate,The Craziescontains plenty of allegory: an invasion by military force, government cover-up and duplicity, madness and eventually genocide (all set, of course, in Romero's beloved Pennsylvania). The President only appears on television, and then only the back of his head is shown as he speaks in detached, almost bored tones. LikeNight of the Living Dead, this film offers no hope, no comfort, and sure as hell no happy ending.

{"description": "Mix two partsApocalypse Nowwith equal partsRaiders of the Lost Arkand any feminist studies text and you'll come up withCannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death.  Shannon Tweed (of Playboy Playmate of the Year fame) and Bill Maher (Politically Incorrect) travel deep into the Uncharted Avocado Jungle of southern California on a mission for the U.S. government to find the ancient Piranha Women.  See, the government wants to avert an avocado shortage precipitated by the Piranha Women's occupation of the jungle; that and the Piranha Women have this little peccadillo of eating their men, thus posing a threat to our phallocentric way of life.  Tweed is supposed to convince them to move to Malibu condos, where they can continue eating men if they like, so long as we can get in there and get those avocados.  Accompanying the duo on their mission, for contrast, is a Home Ec major named Bunny whose secret fantasy is to be tied up with red licorice whip, and who wants to join the Piranha Women so she can get one of those cute outfits.  The previous envoy for the Military, one Dr. Kurtz (Adrienne Barbeau), an anthropologist and feminist, never came back, instead becoming the leader of the threatening Piranha Women.  Yet she's really interested in writing an expos&#xE9; about her time in the jungle (\"a kiss-sacrifice-and-tell book\") so she can get back on the talk show circuit.  \"You don't know what it's like trying to face David Letterman with a book on male insensitivity....

{"description": "Robert Bolt's successful play was not considered a hot commercial property by Columbia Pictures--a period piece about a moral issue without a star, without even a love story. Perhaps that's why Columbia left director Fred Zinnemann alone to makeA Man for All Seasons, as long as he stuck to a relatively small budget. The results took everyone by surprise, as the talky morality play became a box-office hit and collected the top Oscars for 1966. At the play's heart is the standoff between King Henry VIII (Robert Shaw, in young lion form) and Sir Thomas More (Paul Scofield, in an Oscar-winning performance). Henry wants More's official approval of divorce, but More's strict ethical and religious code will not let him waffle. More's rectitude is a source of exasperation to Cardinal Wolsey (Orson Welles in a cameo), who chides, \"If you could just see facts flat on without that horrible moral squint.\" Zinnemann's approach is all simplicity, and indeed the somewhat prosaic staging doesn't create a great deal of cinematic excitement. But the language is worth savoring, and the ethical politics are debated with all the calm and majesty of an absorbing chess game.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000056HEA", "B0057FGCRI", "B0000B1A58", "B001D5F2LI", "B0006GANX2", "B00008J2PG", "B00005AUKE", "B000BITV92", "B0006HBV3W", "B000BYA4HE", "B00AEFY6DI", "B00008LDO7", "076781326X", "B000XJD34I", "B00012FXJ0", "B00004TVUD", "0780021312", "0385496931", "B0018LX9RG", "B004FQX5A2", "B003WEAW04", "B002QXOYQK", "0679728228", "B00003CXBH", "B000FFJ83K", "B001NSLE5I", "B0000549B1", "B00005JKF6", "B000KX0IOA", "B000255LIY", "B00006ADD5", "B00005AUKB", "B000KJTGHO", "B00003CXBU", "B001GLX6TY", "B00004XPPC", "B00AEBB9FA", "B000WMFZMY", "B00005JN8Z", "B00011D1OK", "0898706254", "B00125WAXM", "B0001US8F8", "B0000633QW", "B00006RCO2", "6304907729", "B001D8W7EU", "B00GHU35HM", "B000E1MXTG", "B00AMSM9CW", "0767827775", "B00096S412", "B001GUYAZY", "B0051WTN50", "B00005MEOU", "6305257450", "B002HK9IDQ", "B000E1MXT6", "B000FL7C9G", "B0009S4IKQ", "B000MTEGSG", "B0045HCJQM", "B002VWNIBI", "B000E1ZBFY", "B00011D1OU", "B000LXWAI6", "B00005V1WY", "B00D3K357O", "B006FE83UE", "B0045HCJJY", "B0006GANY6", "B0002BO05S", "B00006RCO3", "B00GA8Z0B0", "B0010AN7Z4", "B00F6SHECS", "B001MVYUQ6", "0783240171", "B00BYCOIU6", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B004XYOQU4"], "bought_together": ["B000056HEA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000056HEA", "0679728228", "B0057FGCRI", "B000255LIY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 125062}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.37, "brand": "", "asin": "6305252564", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-2r8McJlL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Man for All Seasons"}

The story of a girl for whom a bad stroke of luck is no match for her internal strength and purity of heart.

One of three daughters of a man (Jeroen Krabb&eacute;) who dies and leaves her fate in the hands of a conniving stepmother (Anjelica Huston), Danielle is cast into the lowly role of a servant.

Directed by Andy Tennant (who directed Barrymore in TV'sThe Amy Fisher Story),Ever Afterhas that rare ability to win the heart and mind of a viewer simply by being committed to its own innocence, particularly where Barrymore's luminous performance is concerned. A contemporary take on an old, virtually forgotten Hollywood convention--the costume adventure with middling artistic ambition but real audience appeal--Ever Afteris a surprisingly delightful film.--Tom Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 312567}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.58, "brand": "", "asin": "6305265488", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XH5A8YFWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ever After - A Cinderella Story [VHS]"}

{"description": "It seems almost inconceivable that a film as great asLost  Horizonwould be nearly lost to the ravages of age and studio neglect.  Fortunately,  Columbia has compensated for past misdeeds with this superlative DVD release, which restores Capra's classic to near-complete form and provides a thorough--and thoroughly fascinating--account of the film's production and eventual restoration. Of particular interest to film buffs will be the engaging photo essay and accompanying narration by film historian Kendall Miller, whose affectionate (and infectious) obsession withLost Horizonis expressed here for the benefit of posterity. Equally engrossing is the full-length restoration commentary by UCLA film preservation expert Robert Gitt, whose efforts to restore this film were nothing less than heroic. Unfortunately, Gitt is teamed in the commentary with retiredLos Angeles Timesfilm critic Charles Champlin, whose contribution is amiable but superfluous. That quibble aside, this edition ofLost Horizonis one of the most rewarding DVDs of any classic Hollywood film. Although several of Frank Capra's other films have achieved a higher profile,Lost Horizonjust gets better as the years go by, and with its wealth of supplemental features, this DVD is a definitive archival tribute.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005KR6O1C", "B000GRUQL0", "8087888057", "B0006B2AA6", "B008D19ZPY", "B000KJU13C", "B0007PALVQ", "B00EOBB866", "B000083C8K", "B001GLX6US", "0895773619", "B0000714AT", "B000002ZBR", "B00049QQJQ", "B000BYA4HO", "B000083C6R", "B0043GAT5I", "B00KIZY3XW", "B001BSBBDK", "B000OHBCI8", "B00AATUZQA", "B00011D1OU", "B004P8R9OS", "B000ION7A8", "B00BGGITZU", "B00005JKFR", "B0049985XW", "B003NN9ZCK", "B001BSBBIA", "B0002B15RE", "B00006RCO3", "B0011WN03K", "B0006B2A7E", "B000FVQLLQ", "B000A9QK8M", "B0087ZG7OI", "B0039R18WU", "0783229488", "B000KX0IOU", "B000BITV92", "B00008LDNZ", "B000E6ESXK", "B00AEBB8VK", "B000CEV3L4", "B000F7CMQI", "B000085EFE", "B003MJZ07E", "B000HT3PGK", "B00KIZY0EE", "B00000CQJZ", "B001D8W7EU", "B006TTC5A4", "B0007TKNJ2", "B001GLX6UI", "8087830865", "B001GLX6TY", "B0035ECHIG", "B000FVQLKW", "B000BYA4II", "B001BSBBIK", "B000EU1Q1S", "B00005JMR7", "B000E1MXSW", "B000CNESN0", "B0007TKNH4", "B005E7SFAQ", "B00006RCO2", "B006FE83UE", "B00DZP1C9K", "B0000549B0", "B0033PSH7M", "B003YY2886", "B000244EYW", "B00A33J8U2", "B001SMC9L2", "B004DK9DQ0", "B000OFOJ30", "B00004RFHN", "B000A0GOF0", "B000KGGJ1I", "B0045HCJHG", "B0009S4IH4", "B00AEBB97S", "B0045HCJ9E", "B002GSXKQA", "B0045HCJQW", "B005OT7YX8", "B001GUYAZY", "B00AJCUL0I", "B000KJU13M", "B005ZVIN30", "B000NJXG68", "B00AEFXD1O", "B00000F17E", "B000069HYF", "B0002B15Y2", "B00008LDO1", "B000LC4ZD0", "B000B7MX6Q", "B0047BXR1C"], "bought_together": ["B005KR6O1C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005KR6O1C", "B0006B2AA6", "B000GRUQL0", "8087888057"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9024}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.05, "brand": "Unknown", "asin": "6305416222", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51esGDjolTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lost Horizon"}

{"description": "It earned Oscar nods, yet this cinematic look at a genius--that of  English cellist Jacqueline du Pr&eacute;, who enraptured audiences with her  bold,  emblazoned, and wholly unconventional playing style, and who died at  age&nbsp;42--was criticized for its \"lapses\" in truth by people who purportedly  knew du Pr&eacute;. Some of the controversy revolved around the other main character  in Anand Tucker's gorgeous,  involving movie--du Pr&eacute;'s sister, Hilary,  whose book,A Genius in the  Family(cowritten with brother  Piers), dished some dirt on Jackie's sleeping with Hilary's husband. But don't  let that deter you from this ebullient movie experience. The film is a  bisected story (each sister's tale is told in the same amount of screen  time) teeming with heartfelt drama that belies the cheap shots  it received from its detractors. It's stirring, reckless, loving, involving, and rife with  unconventional passion; passion for music, life, art, and the delicate  relationship between these two synchronous, extraordinary sisters  as played by brilliant actors Emily Watson and Rachel Griffiths (both of whom  earned Oscar  nods). Though Watson got the juicy, showy role as Jackie, it's Griffiths who provides the heart, soul, and spine of the film. And director Tucker has that  gift of being able to explain through the visual medium what is happening  inside of his character's heads. He's helped by a fine screenplay by Frank  Boyce Cottrell. No matter what the truth of Hilary and Jackie might really be, this is an  exceptional, rare film that is defined and graced by fine acting and writing.--Paula Nechak", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000SG7Z1I", "B000BDGWF8", "0345432711", "B007GP1CC2", "B0002ISGRO", "0306809761", "0780619587", "B00000K4F9", "B00166UFTS", "B00005AUJK", "0792163087", "B000CCW2O8", "B004U7MR1Y", "B000YRY8BG", "B000N4SHOE", "B0010X73Z6", "B0064MT1FI", "B00005JMJD", "B000055ZF3", "B004XVMCKS", "B0007P0YKY", "B000002S1F", "B000CBG5PG", "B0002XNT1C", "B00003CXDJ", "B00000K3TN", "B00005JL78", "B0009S4IJM", "B0015HOKKS", "B004NBHVNQ", "B004ALIG4W", "B00000FYID", "B00005JLWN", "B00003CXQ4", "B005LAIGF0", "B000BZISSU", "0415997445", "B00003CXZ4", "B00000IQC5", "B004499LWG", "B00005JN0T", "B0000C23D5", "B000092T3P", "B00008RH3L", "B00005JLQW", "B0011VJRVU", "B00E8G5GU6", "B0007ZEOD2", "B00AQBDU4Q", "B004ALIG4M", "B00005KHJJ", "B0073U2EWM", "B0018YCF50", "6305899681", "1590516125", "0784011710", "0792838068", "B00AEBB9FA", "B00003CXKS", "B00005JLSB", "B004SIP8WU", "B000062XE6", "6304712936", "B007GP1AXI", "B008220C38", "B00031TXC2", "B002ONC9NC", "B00AZMFO6I", "B004SIP71M", "B000GG4Y32", "B0014GI6I2", "B0030IIZ2O", "B004XVMCRG", "B000ETRCN0", "B00439GWRE", "B002VECLVO", "0788815490", "B000FS9UKI", "B00011D1OK", "B0008ENID4", "6305428522", "B0045HCJGW", "B000CCW2P2", "B001PPLJIQ", "B00AEFXW8I", "B007UW9W5U", "B007T40GMW", "B000EU1Q1S", "B000F9RB8K", "B0002II6LK", "0783113315", "B00DPUB56U", "B00AEBB9EG", "B004SIP98S", "B000CBG5PQ", "B00005JPX8", "B00003CXPD", "B000085OY1", "B00466H3A4", "B000EBD9T4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000SG7Z1I", "B007GP1CC2", "0345432711", "6304712936"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 251924}, "asin": "6305447233", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SK01F1NZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hilary &amp; Jackie"}
{"description": "For truly clever dialogue and a smartly structured plot, you can't go wrong with Oscar Wilde. Wilde's playAn Ideal Husbandis not his best known, but this film adaptation has all the wit you could ask for and a cast with the chops to deliver it: Cate Blanchett (Elizabeth,Oscar and Lucinda), Julianne Moore (Short Cuts,Boogie Nights), Minnie Driver (Grosse Pointe Blank,Big Night), Jeremy Northam (The Winslow Boy,Emma), and especially Rupert Everett (My Best Friend's Wedding,A Midsummer Night's Dream), who tosses off perfect epigrams with unflappable aplomb. The plot hinges on Northam, a member of Parliament (the British governing body, not the funk band) with a skeleton in his closet who is blackmailed into a shady business deal by a lady of mystery (Moore), who turns out to be a loathed school chum of the parliamentarian's wife (Blanchett). Everything is resolved happily, but not until after some devious twists of fate, several mistaken identities, lots of comic banter, and much social skewering. Wilde, who came to ruin when his homosexuality was brought to light, has a sharp eye for hypocrisy and the artificial poses demanded by society--but political commentary never gets in the way of a smart laugh.

{"description": "\"I have a bad feeling about this,\" says the young Obi-Wan Kenobi  (played by Ewan McGregor) inStar Wars: Episode I, The Phantom  Menaceas he steps off a spaceship and into the most anticipated cinematic event... well, ever. He might as well be speaking for the  legions of fans of the original episodes in theStar Warssaga  who can't help but secretly ask themselves: Sure, this isStar  Wars, but is itmy Star Wars? The original elevated  moviegoers' expectations so high that it would have been impossible for  any subsequent film to meet them. And as with all theStar Warsmovies,The Phantom Menacefeatures inexplicable plot twists, a  fistful of loose threads, and some cheek-chewing dialogue. Han Solo's  swagger is sorely missed, as is the pervading menace of heavy-breathing  Darth Vader. There is still way too much quasi-mystical mumbo jumbo,  and some of what was fresh aboutStar Wars22 years earlier  feels formulaic. Yet there's much to admire. The special effects are  stupendous; three worlds are populated with a m&eacute;lange of creatures, flora, and horizons rendered in absolute  detail. The action and battle scenes are breathtaking in their  complexity. And one particular sequence of the film--the  adrenaline-infused pod race through the Tatooine desert--makes the chariot race inBen-Hurlook like a Sunday stroll through the park.Among the host of new characters, there are a few familiar walk-ons. We  witness the first meeting between R2-D2 and C-3PO, Jabba the Hutt looks  younger and slimmer (but not young and slim), and Yoda is as crabby as  ever. Natalie Portman's stately Queen Amidala sports hairdos that make  Princess Leia look dowdy and wields a mean laser. We never bond with  Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson), and Obi-Wan's day is yet to come. Jar Jar Binks, a cross  between a Muppet, a frog, and a hippie, provides many of the movie's lighter moments, while Sith Lord Darth  Maul is a formidable force. Baby-faced Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) looks too young  and innocent to command the powers of the Force or wield a lightsaber (much less transmute into the future Darth Vader), but his  boyish exuberance wins over skeptics.Near the end of the movie, Palpatine, the new leader of the Republic,  may be speaking for fans eagerly awaitingEpisode IIwhen he  pats young Anakin on the head and says, \"We will watch your career with  great interest.\" Indeed! --Tod Nelson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000633ZP", "6301792734", "B00005JLXH", "B00006HBUJ", "6304539258", "6304539274", "6301792769", "B000FQVX78", "6304539290", "0792158261", "B000FQJAJG", "6304117752", "0767729307", "B001GQSY5K", "6304178352", "B000FAGGWQ", "B00BBND56G", "B000FQJAIW", "B00005LL26", "B00003CXCT", "B00003CXI0", "B002I9Z8AS", "B00006AL1C", "B00CFWWDWE", "B000066HAS", "B000001ON6", "B000MUANT6", "6305587159"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLXH", "B00006HBUJ"], "also_viewed": ["B00006HBUJ", "B00005JLXH", "B00E9PMML2", "B0000633ZP", "6301792734", "B00BBND56G", "6304539258", "6301792769", "6304539274", "B00006JDUE", "0767729307", "B00E9PMMX0", "B000FQJAIW", "B000FQVX78", "B000FQJAJG", "B00000IQMT", "B000FAGGWQ", "B003ZSJ212", "0345434110", "6303148352", "6304089767", "0439834775", "6304117752", "B00BUZW14M", "6304500831", "0590010891", "0345341465", "6304434340", "B001GQSY5K", "155890641X", "B00005LL26", "6302961572", "0792151712", "B003W77SEO", "B000M4Y8JI", "0767825411", "B00003CXXI", "B00000IZ8A", "B00169IZN8", "6302787068", "B00006G8LB", "080010367X", "0800125762", "6302091632", "0792158261", "B000850IS6", "6300214826", "6303506291", "B00005V1Z8", "B000641D2Y", "0784011923", "B00008Y47S", "6300214060", "630382790X", "B00003CXI0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 79460}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.44, "brand": "Star Wars", "asin": "630575067X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41SJPKK4S4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Wars - Episode I, The Phantom Menace [VHS]"}

{"description": "Gun Shyhad the misfortune to come along after several other \"killer pursues therapy\" movies/TV shows (Grosse Pointe Blank,Analyze This,The Sopranos); in this case, it's a DEA agent and not a Mafioso, but that wasn't enough to keep it from getting swept aside. Liam Neeson (Schindler's List,Rob Roy) plays Charlie, a government undercover agent whose last mission got botched, resulting in his partner's death. But the DEA isn't willing to let him get out early; clinging to his fantasy of a seaside retirement home, Charlie agrees to one more mission, even though he's convinced that the New York City gangster he's investigating will kill him. On his flight to the city, he meets a psychiatrist who encourages him to join a group therapy session. Meanwhile, it turns out that the gangster Fulvio, played by busy character actor Oliver Platt (Funny Bones,Bulworth), is equally miserable with his career. Curiously, Neeson and Platt both seem initially miscast--Neeson exudes a solid imperturbability, and Platt comes off as too soft to be really threatening--but over the course of the movie, their performances become increasingly compelling, perhaps because they are cast against type. Their neuroses, which initially seem like weak gags, start feeling genuine and sad.Gun Shyis marketed as a comedy, but its strength is in the truth of its characters. Sandra Bullock (who also produced the film) has a small role as a gastroenterologist with whom Charlie falls in love.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305736685", "B000M341SC", "B00066FB2A", "B00465I16K", "B0002IQLHQ", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B0000640RY", "B00000JGHN", "B000CEV3M8", "0783235380", "B00068GTK6", "B002SYAGNC", "B000058TLQ", "B000GB5M3S", "B0077ATSSQ", "B0045HCJGC", "B000CCBCHG", "B003498SCQ", "B00008G6E8", "B00FQRZ6EM", "B003M785HS", "B003IY498Y", "B002NZK5VO", "B00IARA8KM", "B00004UEDQ", "B0006GANOQ", "B0001GF24M", "B004A8ZX28", "B003L20IG0", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B00JA3RVG4", "B000EXDRLW", "B0000AYGBF", "B000A3XY5A", "B00441GZ46", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B002NZK5RS", "B00030WW4Y", "B002NZK5V4", "B00JL6L4UY", "B00AIBZMD6", "B005FH1RRI", "B00KM9LY3Q", "B00JU949TK", "B0002235QW", "B000QGDY0G", "B002NTDXQ4", "B00J5G1P2W", "079283366X", "6304765266", "B005LAIGRS", "B0007PALGG", "B000P6R5RK", "B002OVED88", "B00008L3UM", "B002ZG994U", "B00HF98SPS", "B00066FB52", "B000HEWEE4", "B00E8RKHWW", "B00HWWUR02", "B00J5JSV3A", "B000065K2V", "B008JFURII", "B00HEPE6MM", "B00008NRI7", "B008E70EES", "B00006ZXSQ", "B000BVM1S2", "B0037QGS0A", "B005NKIPUY", "0783237413", "B00CX7TOOG", "B002DU39GW", "B000046PUQ", "0767810872", "B004OB2EYQ", "B00015YVDG", "B002K0WBXW", "6305133409", "B003PIUIJC", "1558908382", "B000N4SHOO", "B00E44EZUE", "B00FFT1AZK", "B005LAIIRQ", "B00H1RMWYW", "B00DX88IKK", "B008JFUPPI", "6305822581", "B007C4ZJ0S", "B00HEPDGKA", "B0077ATSZE", "B000F7CMRM", "B0068MNO2U", "B00002E23C", "B002AS464Q", "B002ZG984Q", "B001KO1BCQ", "B004D9ADD8"], "bought_together": ["B000M341SC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AQ5905U", "B000M341SC", "B000CEV3M8", "6305736685"]}, "price": 7.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 94754}, "asin": "6305874867", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ADTC6E1BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gun Shy"}

{"description": "Pixar genius reigns in this funny romantic comedy, which stars a robot who says absolutely nothing for a full 25 minutes yet somehow completely transfixes and endears himself to the audience within the first few minutes of the film. As the last robot left on earth, Wall-E (voiced by Ben Burtt) is one small robot--with a big, big heart--who holds the future of earth and mankind squarely in the palm of his metal hand. He's outlasted all the \"Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class\" robots that were assigned some 700 years ago to clean up the environmental mess that man made of earth while man vacationed aboard the luxury spaceship Axiom. Wall-E has dutifully gone about his job compacting trash, the extreme solitude broken only by his pet cockroach, but he's developed some oddly human habits and ideas. When the Axiom sends its regularly scheduled robotic EVE probe (Elissa Knight) to earth, Wall-E is instantly smitten and proceeds to try to impress EVE with his collection of human memorabilia. EVE's directive compels her to bring Wall-E's newly collected plant sprout to the captain of the Axiom and Wall-E follows in hot pursuit. Suddenly, the human world is turned upside down and the Captain (Jeff Garlin) joins forces with Wall-E and a cast of other misfit robots to lead the now lethargic people back home to earth. Wall-E is a great family film with the most impressive aspect being the depth of emotion conveyed by a simple robot--a machine typically considered devoid of emotion, but made so absolutely touching by the magic of Pixar animation. Also well-worth admiring are the sweeping views from space, the creative yet disturbing vision of what strange luxuries a future space vacation might offer, and the innovative use of trash in a future cityscape. Underneath the slapstick comedy and touching love story is a poignant message about the folly of human greed and its potential effects on earth and the entire human race.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000VBJEEG", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00007LVCM", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B00AFEX83C", "0736424229", "B00005JN4W", "B00005JNQS", "B0042U94UQ", "B00E9ZATJO", "B001OMU6UM", "B00005JNS0", "B0030IIZ4M", "B0034JKZ86", "B002ZG97YM", "B002WJI2QQ", "B004HO6I4M", "B008YWY0HK", "B0012EM5D8", "B0006UEVT0", "B009SZCC9U", "B004G600A4", "B00AAXFYPI", "B00F522C7C", "B008Z1LBU4", "B00CTNYLQA", "B003H9M1Q2", "B000AAF1TU", "B008JFUQ16", "B000ROAK2W", "B000AY74OG", "B00275EHJG", "B00CWM58WY", "B00009M9BK", "B00EV1YZ96", "B001DPHDCY", "B000MV9026", "B001O5LVPI", "0783231474", "B00CQRN3QI", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00I6JOD2S", "B001HN6922", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B0087F7VSY", "B001U2MQE0", "B0030IIYYS", "B00A83075M", "B00H4Z07Q6", "B005LAIH4A", "B000DWMYQ8", "B00CHVJODE", "B0000AOX0O", "B003UESJF6", "B00JK531ES", "B00HLTD2OE", "B0001I561E", "B00BGYO7HG", "B003ZHVJGO", "B001ILFUD2", "B0002YLCOM", "B0039N74CW", "B00004U9WQ", "B00937R6QC", "B00CUDD0C0", "B004EPZ034", "B00004R99S", "B00003CXB4", "B000065V42", "B00005RDSQ", "B004ZBACOE", "B001GCUO7A", "B00AO686JC", "B000AAF1U4", "B0006JMLRK", "B00005JMQZ", "B0043X1FOK", "B00C7JGDBW", "B001JRB17Y", "B001KVZ6G6", "B00005TN8K", "B00005JMFH", "B00E9ZATKI", "B001ILFUDC", "B000V1Y44G", "B00003CX8Y", "B0011U52E2", "B00EBBGLFC", "B000YERP2S", "B00009YXAW", "B00003CXCQ", "B002NZK5SW", "B000G75AZC", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B0084IHVGG", "B00947N6D8", "B004LWZW7Y"], "bought_together": ["B001KVZ6FW", "B000VBJEEG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004HO6I4M", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00I6JOD2S", "B00005JN4W"]}, "price": 17.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 319062}, "asin": "7883706837", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51u-jDIxUZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)"}

{"description": "Considered by many to represent a low point in Steven Spielberg's  career,  1990'sAlwaysdid suggest something of a temporary drift in the  director's sensibility. A remake of the  classic Spencer Tracy filmA Guy Named Joe,Alwaysstars  Richard Dreyfuss as a Forest Service pilot who takes great risks with his own  life to douse wildfires from a plane. After promising his frightened fianc&eacute;e  (Holly Hunter) to keep his feet on the ground and go into teaching,  Dreyfuss's character is killed during one last flight. But his spirit wanders  restlessly, hopelessly attached to and possessive of Hunter, who can't see or  hear him. Then the real conflict begins: a trainee pilot (Brad Johnson), a  likable doofus, begins wooing a not-unappreciative Hunter--and it becomes  Dreyfuss's heavenly mandate to accept, and even assist in, their budding  romance. The trouble with the film is a certain airlessness, a  hyper-inventiveness in every scene and sequence that screams of Spielberg's self-education in Hollywood classicism.

{"description": "Imagine if an actor's director like Eric Rohmer--whose films consist almost entirely of conversation between pairs or small groups of people--made a film that incorporated elements from movies likeDark City,eXistenZ,The Thirteenth Floor,The Truman Show, andTotal Recall. The result might resemble Alejandro Amenabar's remarkable second feature,Open Your Eyes, which favors ideas over effects and offers twist upon twist with mind-warping agility. This film rewards multiple viewings, pushing the viewer toward one perception of reality, then switching to another until reality itself is called into question. Melodrama, love story, and psychological thriller combine with a dash of science fiction, forming a plot that is both disorienting and deceptively precise.Set in Madrid, the story defies description, but this much can be revealed: young, handsome Cesar (Eduardo Noriega) is vain, rich, charming, and--following a botched suicide-murder scheme by a jilted lover--horribly disfigured. He'd fallen in love with Sofia (Pen&eacute;lope Cruz) but is now an embittered husk of his former self, stuck in a \"psychiatric penitentiary\" on a murder charge and hiding behind an expressionless mask. His reality has crumbled, but as the film's agenda is gradually revealed, we realize that there are other factors in play. Exposing that agenda would be a criminal offense against those who haven't seen the film; suffice it to say thatOpen Your Eyestakes you into the twilight zone and beyond, and does so cleverly enough to prompt Tom Cruise to produce and star in an English-language remake,Vanilla Sky. The 2001 remake, directed by Cameron Crowe, costars Cameron Diaz and Pen&eacute;lope Cruz, who reprises her original role.--Jeff Shannon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 580019}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.98, "brand": "", "asin": "B00000JMOI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41R2BBJY96L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Open Your Eyes [VHS]"}
{"description": "Watching a Nick Broomfield documentary (Aileen Wuornos: The Selling of a Serial Killer,Heidi Fleiss: Hollywood Madam) makes one not just want to shower, but to scrub oneself raw like Meryl Streep did inSilkwood. Going where even the tabloids fear to tread, the controversialKurt & Courtneycould also be calledCourtney and Me. Investigating the apparent suicide of grunge icon Cobain, Broomfield runs into a formidable obstacle, namely Cobain's widow, Courtney Love. She blocked permission for him to use any of Cobain's music and ultimately got the film yanked from the Sundance Film Festival. Can't really blame her, as Broomfield follows the lead of a motley crew of conspiracy theorists, grudge-carrying former boyfriends, and estranged parents who suggest that Cobain was actually murdered at Love's behest. For those who watched bemused as Love reinvented herself as a Hollywood glamour girl, this is luridly entertaining stuff--albeit suspect. How much stock to put in S&M; rocker El Duce (where does Bloomfield find these people?), who claims to have been offered money by Love to kill Cobain, and then offers to tell more if Broomfield will buy him a beer? Broomfield paints a much more sympathetic portrait of Cobain. In the film's most touching moment, an aunt plays a tape of a 2-year-old Cobain singing. \"He's a prettly loud little guy,\" she says. These scenes will be nirvana for Cobain fans.--Donald Liebenson", "price": 24.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 553789}, "asin": "B00000JRWS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NCYFH6ENL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Kurt &amp; Courtney [VHS]"}

{"description": "Hong Kongwuxiafilms, or martial arts fantasies, traditionally squeeze poor acting, slapstick humor, and silly story lines between elaborate fight scenes in which characters can literally fly.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragonhas no shortage of breathtaking battles, but it also has the dramatic soul of a Greek tragedy and the sweep of an epic romance. This is the work of director Ang Lee, who fell in love with movies while watchingwuxiafilms as a youngster and madeCrouching Tigeras a tribute to the form. To elevate the genre above its B-movie roots and broaden its appeal, Lee did two important things. First, he assembled an all-star lineup of talent, joining the famous Asian actors Chow Yun-fat and Michelle Yeoh with the striking, charismatic newcomer Zhang Ziyi. Behind the scenes, Lee called upon cinematographer Peter Pau (The Killer,The Bride with White Hair) and legendary fight choreographer Yuen Wo-ping, best known outside Asia for his work onThe Matrix. Second, in adapting the story from a Chinese pulp-fiction novel written by Wang Du Lu, Lee focused not on the pursuit of a legendary sword known as \"The Green Destiny,\" but instead on the struggles of his female leads against social obligation. In his hands, the requisite fight scenes become another means of expressing the individual spirits of his characters and their conflicts with society and each other.The filming required an immense effort from all involved. Chow and Yeoh had to learn to speak Mandarin, which Lee insisted on using instead of Cantonese to achieve a more classic, lyrical feel. The astonishing battles between Jen (Zhang) and Yu Shu Lien (Yeoh) on the rooftops and Jen and Li Mu Bai (Chow) atop the branches of bamboo trees required weeks of excruciating wire and harness work (which in turn required meticulous \"digital wire removal\"). But the result is a seamless blend of action, romance, and social commentary in a populist film that, like its young star Zhang, soars with balletic grace and dignity.--Eugene Wei", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007QS27K"], "also_viewed": ["B0007Q6VXC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 367958}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.95, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXR3", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G39T50SDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]"}

{"description": "Employing shock techniques and sound design in a relentless sensory assault,Requiem for a Dreamis about nothing less than the systematic destruction of hope. Based on the novel by Hubert Selby Jr., and adapted by Selby and director Darren Aronofsky, this is undoubtedly one of the most effective films ever made about the experience of drug addiction (both euphoric and nightmarish), and few would deny that Aronofsky, in following his breakthrough filmPi, has pushed the medium to a disturbing extreme, thrusting conventional narrative into a panic zone of traumatized psyches and bodies pushed to the furthest boundaries of chemical tolerance. It's too easy to call this a cautionary tale; it's a guided tour through hell, with Aronofsky as our bold and ruthless host.The film focuses on a quartet of doomed souls, but it's Ellen Burstyn--in a raw and bravely triumphant performance--who most desperately embodies the downward spiral of drug abuse. As lonely widow Sara Goldfarb, she invests all of her dreams in an absurd self-help TV game show, jolting her bloodstream with diet pills and coffee while her son Harry (Jared Leto) shoots heroin with his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and slumming girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly). They're careening toward madness at varying speeds, and Aronofsky tracks this gloomy process by endlessly repeating the imagery of their deadly routines. Tormented by her dietary regime, Sara even imagines a carnivorous refrigerator in one of the film's most memorable scenes. And yet... does any of this have a point? Is Aronofsky telling us anything that any sane person doesn't already know?Requiem for a Dreamis a noteworthy film, but watching it twice would qualify as masochistic behavior.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JM23", "6305594333", "B0007CEXYK", "B00005YUPD", "078401213X", "1560252480", "B00H3JHGBC", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005JMJG", "B000I0QL7I", "B0009A40ES", "B00049QQHI", "B00005ATQB", "B000LAZDPG", "B00003CXZ4", "0792838068", "B0000AC8LR", "0783229526", "6305692572", "B0041KKYEM", "B000QGEB1M", "B00008977H", "B001AR60GK", "B000MGB6NM", "B0045HCJ08", "6305313687", "B001TOD92C", "B00009Y3QI", "B000NO39FG", "B000JBXXYK", "B00008975Z", "6305162026", "B00004UEDQ", "B000068MC2", "B00606OZUY", "B00003CWQR", "B000ERVK4Y", "B000A7DVR2", "B000A9QK6E", "B00EUENWIY", "B0016MJ6T2", "B00005JPAR", "B00008MTXI", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEFXESQ", "B000JMK6LW", "B00004Y6Q5", "B000FVQLQQ", "B000BYA5G4", "B00005JKJA", "B00005JKM2", "B0029LHW68", "B000BBOUUE", "B004FQX5B6", "B000PAAJZ6", "B000N3SU92", "B003YKYX9M", "B00AEBB8O2", "B00007AJF8", "B00A2H9QN8", "B0009WFEDC", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00013RC2K", "B000A7Q2DM", "B00003CXWV", "0792845803", "B001URA5Y8", "B00195I3O0", "B00006AFUR", "B000063JDE", "B00BMKGZVA", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00112S8RS", "B00177YA6U", "0767837398", "B000O76ZQC", "B0052ADP6Y", "B000J10F8C", "B000E6ESU8", "B00009OOFH", "B00005JLRE", "B0059GVBHG", "0767824954", "B00005JLWN", "B00E8G5GU6", "B000QXDCLA", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00004ZETA", "B00AEBB9CS", "B000021Y77", "B00011CZRE", "B002VECM4A", "B00003CXKS", "B006KH6CF4", "B000K7VHQE", "6305127654", "B00AFEXRME", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00020HB32"], "bought_together": ["B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JM23"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JMJG", "B000MEYKD2", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JPAR"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 222264}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.36, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXP1", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519CB9K0QML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut"}

{"description": "Shot in the rough, 16-millimeter style of a low-budget documentary,Tigerlandmarked director Joel Schumacher's welcomed return to simplicity after a slew of bloated blockbusters likeBatman & Robin. In revitalizing Schumacher's directorial talent,Tigerland--partially inspired by the Danish Dogme 95 movement of no-frills filmmaking--suggested that one solution to Hollywood's moribund \"product\" was to abandon excess, focus on essentials, and assemble a fine cast of unknown actors to make it all worthwhile. To that end,Tigerlandalso marked the deserving arrival of Irish actor Colin Farrell as Hollywood's hottest new discovery.Its story never leaves U.S. soil, soTigerlanddiffers from such in-country Vietnam films asPlatoonandFull Metal Jacket. Instead, it's about the anxieties and moral dilemmas that arise from theanticipationof death and killing. These roiling emotions are focused on the character of Private Bozz (Farrell), whose insubordination betrays a singular knack for leadership during infantry training at Fort Polk, Louisiana, in 1971. Part R.P. McMurphy and part Cool Hand Luke, Bozz is a defiant maverick, barely tolerated by his superiors, challenged or revered by his fellow grunts, and ultimately honed into a soldier of remarkable promise. An intense final week in the live-ammo training ground nicknamed \"Tigerland\" galvanizes the platoon and Bozz's place in it, and although the film (partially based on cowriter Ross Klavan's own experience) lacks the emotional impact ofPlatoon, it deals quite potently with the internal conflicts that must be waged before external warfare can be endured.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003M987QK", "B000FIHN5M", "B0002Y4PPK", "B00005JLX2", "B00005JKTP", "B00005JLQN", "B001MZ5W3M", "B004C45AZU", "B006ISJQ26", "B0015D20FE", "B000MGB6NM", "B003LL3FIY", "B0013D8LC2", "B0018BD9DA", "B000J4QWMC", "B0002V7SOS", "B00005QW6V", "B00AEBBA36", "B000P0J09C", "B00008EYA5", "B000ELL1R6", "B003Y5H5FG", "B00005PJ8L", "B003ELKNH2", "079284646X", "B00AEBB86U", "B000DZIGDU", "B00005PJ8T", "B00005JK8K", "B00AEFY4IA", "1558908315", "B000N3SRO0", "B004SUDQCM", "B001BNFRB2", "B00I6JODGO", "B00CLH09UQ", "B00096S4BM", "B00003CXHJ", "B00005JKQS", "B00001ZWUS", "B000MRA542", "B00JA3RVG4", "B00009RDG9", "B00005PJ8K", "B0001NBMGC", "B00AEFXVCU", "B006TTC5HC", "B003M987AQ", "B00000F2UF", "B00096S4BW", "B00004WG2F", "B00005JA9F", "B00HOGBXS6", "B000R9U3B0", "B0001NBMHQ", "B004P7CMVE", "B002ZG97RE", "B00275EGWY", "B0045HCJ0S", "B00005BJWC", "B007REV4LQ", "6304711905", "B0007TKNLA", "B00001U0DU", "B000095WW8", "B000R4SMCW", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00AMSQBTY", "B00005JL78", "B00004ZBVG", "B000BRP4BM", "B00AEFYENK", "B004TPJN3C", "B000065U1N", "B00005BCKG", "B008JFUN50", "B00IKM5OCO", "B00J11U54K", "0792841662", "B00H1RMWYW", "B00096S4DA", "B000XR9L50", "B001ULAUF8", "B00004RF82", "B00005QBZA", "6304765258", "B005LAIIRQ", "B0001FVDIC", "B001AZW73M", "B000WMA6R8", "0792844017", "B003BV8ID6", "B00005BCKF", "B007S0DCUU", "B0008ENHTY", "B00004STDN", "B00003CXQG", "6304806434", "B004ZJZQGA", "B004P7CMOQ"], "bought_together": ["B003M987QK", "B000FIHN5M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0006HBZXS", "B004U7MQWY", "B00005JKTP", "0783222149"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 39744}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.66, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00003CXOY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41K9ZC8W0ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tigerland"}

When she borrows her sister's (Elizabeth Perkins) wedding limo and plows it into someone's front porch, the wild life she shares with her boyfriend, Jasper (Dominic West), comes to a screeching halt. She earns herself a DUI and a 28-day stretch in rehab. There, she faces an unthinkable set of rules (no cell phones!) and some strange rituals, like chanting and (gulp!) sharing her feelings.

{"description": "The Maltese FalconStill the tightest, sharpest, and most cynical of Hollywood's official deathless classics, bracingly tough even by post-Tarantino standards. Humphrey Bogart is Dashiell Hammett's definitive private eye, Sam Spade, struggling to keep his hard-boiled cool as the double-crosses pile up around his ankles. The plot, which dances all around the stolen Middle Eastern statuette of the title, is too baroque to try to follow, and it doesn't make a bit of difference. The dialogue, much of it lifted straight from Hammett, is delivered with whip-crack speed and sneering ferocity, as Bogie faces off against Peter Lorre and Sidney Greenstreet, fends off the duplicitous advances of Mary Astor, and roughs up a cringing \"gunsel\" played by Elisha Cook Jr. It's an action movie of sorts, at least by implication: the characters always seem keyed up, right on the verge of erupting into violence. This is a turning-point picture in several respects: John Huston (The African Queen) made his directorial debut here in 1941, and Bogart, who had mostly played bad guys, was a last-minute substitution for George Raft, who must have been kicking himself for years afterward. This is the role that made Bogart a star and established his trendsetting (and still influential) antihero persona.--David ChuteCasablancaA truly perfect movie,Casablanca(1942) still wows viewers today, and for good reason. Its unique story of a love triangle set against terribly high stakes in the war against a monster is sophisticated instead of outlandish, intriguing instead of garish. Humphrey Bogart plays the allegedly apolitical club owner in unoccupied French territory that is nevertheless crawling with Nazis; Ingrid Bergman is the lover who mysteriously deserted him in Paris; and Paul Heinreid is her heroic, slightly bewildered husband. Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, and Conrad Veidt are among what may be the best supporting cast in the history of Hollywood films. This is certainly among the most spirited and ennobling movies ever made.--Tom KeoghThe Big SleepHumphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall made screen history together more than once, but they were never more popular than in this 1946 adaptation of Raymond Chandler's novel, directed by Howard Hawks (To Have and Have Not). Bogart plays private eye Philip Marlowe, who is hired by a wealthy socialite (Bacall) to look into troubles stirred up by her wild, young sister (Martha Vickers). Legendarily complicated (so much so that even Chandler had trouble following the plot), the film is nonetheless hugely entertaining and atmospheric, an electrifying plunge into the exotica of detective fiction. William Faulkner wrote the screenplay.--Tom KeoghKey LargoJohn Huston directed this smart 1948 thriller about a gangster (Edward G. Robinson) who holds a number of people hostage in a hotel in the Florida Keys during a tropical storm. Humphrey Bogart is the returning war veteran who takes on the villains, and Lauren Bacall is on hand as one of the people on the wrong end of Robinson's gun. Somewhat similar in tone to Howard Hawks'sTo Have and Have Not(which also featured Bogart and Bacall), this moody movie captures a certain despair offset by the bond between individuals united by common purpose. Claire Trevor won an Academy Award for her part as Robinson's alcoholic girlfriend.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FFJYAW", "B0049985XW", "B00AEFXD1O", "078322592X", "B0087ZG7OI", "B00AEFYO5I", "B00AEBB89C", "B009T6CXG0", "B00005Q4D6", "B0047BXQZY", "B00AEFXNXW", "B00AEBBA0E", "B000G6BLWE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002VWNIAY", "B003ZEQMH8", "B000FFJYAW", "B003UGLCIK"]}, "price": 14.19, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 109271}, "asin": "B00004XMRW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518NNQHZA6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Humphrey Bogart Collection (The Big Sleep/The Maltese Falcon/Casablanca/Key Largo)"}
{"description": "Having taken Shakespeare at his word onHamlet(i.e., not cutting  a single syllable out of a very long play), Kenneth Branagh selects a more radical approach withLove's Labour's Lost. Here the prolific director-star weeds out much of the play's dialogue and adds songs and dances of a decidedly modern bent. The King of Navarre (Alessandro Nivola, Nicolas Cage's wacko brother inFace/Off) and his three comrades (Branagh, Matthew Lillard, Adrian Lester) take a vow:  no womanly distractions while they pursue their studies. Ah, but at that very moment, floating down a magical studio-built river, is the queen of France (Alicia Silverstone), accompanied by three ladies-in-waiting. You do the math. Branagh has set the tale on the eve of the Second World War, which allows for the inclusion of vintage pop songs, including \"Cheek to Cheek,\" \"The Way You Look Tonight,\" and a rousing chorus of \"There's No Business Like Show Business,\" led by--who else?--Nathan Lane. The fact that most of the cast members are not accomplished song-and-dance folk is clearly meant to charm, but the results are spotty at best. Perhaps the most dynamic performer is Natascha McElhone (memorable fromRonin), whose aristocratic bearing and bottomless eyes lend a gravity to the material that is otherwise absent from Branagh's twinkly staging. The play contains some of Shakespeare's loveliest paeans to the language of love, yet Branagh seems to be in a hurry to juice everything up lest the audience lose interest. The labor shows.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00CDV4JNS", "B0000714BZ", "079284615X", "B004M9ZI0M", "B00005S872", "B00005JLCI", "6305622876", "B00000JL7T", "B000HWZ4AC", "B00A7OBIGO", "B004H0M31I", "B001TR4G6W", "B0002TVWYW", "B003TRS8XM", "B0013D8LWC", "B00019072G", "B00443FMKM", "B00DQN6IOK", "B007RP4CAA", "B007H7OQW2", "B00ECR7KX2", "B000BP86VE", "B00AMEZDPG", "B00004TB8E", "B004P29LDG", "B000QGE8JC", "B000QGE8IS", "B00006G8HO", "B000777I88", "B007CJL17S", "B0007CNXV4", "B0009ZE9EY", "B007I1Q50S", "B003TRS8VY", "B00AJER4EM", "B000Q7ZNDG", "B00B2BYY1W", "1904271103", "B004SIP83Y", "B00B1E6EAY", "B00ECR7L0Y", "B0038RSJ0U", "B00005JKGX", "B0079K4YL0", "B003X82D1K", "B0007LFPJ8", "0769712231", "B00009MEJ4", "B001LPWGHS", "B007RP4BZ6", "B00ANQHR7U", "B00AZFECHW", "B0002235QM", "B000OY9VFW", "B004U7MQZ6", "B00AEFYO08", "B000056HEA", "B008SBXFUU", "0784001332", "B004Q8D1FS", "0983502714", "B003NEQ0X6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000714BZ", "B00CDV4JNS", "6305622876", "B00ECR7KX2"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 91030}, "asin": "B00004Z4WW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51E9F76ZR4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Love's Labour's Lost"}

{"description": "This black and white horror movie, filmed in California but with dialogue in Esperanto, is unlike anything you've ever seen.Incubusinverts the usual moral battle of a good person tempted by evil. When a headstrong, blond, young succubus named Kia (Allyson Ames) becomes bored with luring the corrupt and sinful to their ultimate demise, she decides she's going to tackle a truly good man (in the form of a very young William Shatner, of all people). An older, wiser succubus warns Kia that the good have an uncanny power called love, but Kia recklessly dives in, confident in her seductive powers--until she finds herself spiritually defiled by goodness and must summon an incubus (Milos Milos) to enact revenge. The pacing is slow but eerily effective, as are the stark cinematography and low-budget effects. Shatner's intonations are just as distinctive in Esperanto as in English, but that only adds to the movie's overall stylization.Incubusshares a kinship withCarnival of Souls, another low-budget black and white horror film that has more going on than buckets of gore. ThoughIncubuswould seem to be heavily influenced by Ingmar Bergman, director Leslie Stevens has said he was more affected by Japanese samurai films.

{"description": "The classic science fiction novel by H.G. Wells becomes this big-budget adventure directed by the author's great-grandson Simon Wells. Guy Pearce stars as Alexander Hartdegen, a scientist, professor, and inventor in 1895 New York City who believes that time travel is possible. The sudden and unexpected death of his fianc&#x82;e spurs Alexander to build a time machine, which he hopes to use in an effort to change the past. When he is unable to change the past, Alexander hurls himself more than 800,000 years into the future, seeking answers about the nature of time, but instead encountering a dystopian world where humanity has divided up into two races, the peaceful Eloi and the subterranean Morlocks. Befriending the beautiful Eloi woman Mara (pop singer Samantha Mumba), Alexander must set out to save her from the underground world of the Morlocks when she is captured by them. Along the way, he is aided by Vox (Orlando Jones), a bio-mechanical being from the 21st century. Ultimately, Alexander makes a shocking discovery about the true nature of the Eloi and Morlocks and decides that the only way to change the future is to alter the present. Due to exhaustion, director Wells was briefly replaced during the last few weeks of production by Gore Verbinski, director of The Mexican (2001). The Time Machine co-stars Jeremy Irons and Mark Addy.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0045HCJSA", "B001BGS17Q", "B000CZ0PNK", "B00LNBQ8SI", "B00LMCDHMS", "B00LNBQ8UG", "B00ANDFL3A", "B00IYJFB2G", "0780619951", "B0000639BZ", "B00003CXXP", "B00003CWU3", "630587493X", "B00K2CHVSK", "B00007JMD8", "B00005JNTI", "B00L4K3MLE", "B00005JKU0", "B00AEBB8VK", "B000FVQLKW", "B00K2CHWYI", "B00LCAD24S", "B00005JKFR", "B001SGEUYW", "0780622650", "B005FQ2H8W", "B0019ESNGY", "B002945DU2", "B00AEBB8QK", "B00020HAWE", "B00000G3PA", "B00009NHC0", "0790750201", "B000HEWEDK", "B001P9N94E", "B00IKM5N1G", "B00008G8M5", "B00005JL78", "B000O78KWE", "B0000844I8", "B0050MB5KM", "B00007G1YQ", "B008JFUO36", "B00D9EJFZA", "B0000AUHOH", "B00133KHBK", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B00IKM5LXG", "B000096IAC", "B00003CXKM", "B0016I0AJG", "B00008G8M4", "B000YDOOHI", "B00K7IPGS6", "B003NH3X5Q", "B008JFUNHI", "B00005N5S5", "0767812166", "B001EAWMGA", "B0045HCJ0S", "B002NZK5SM", "B00ECW9UJY", "B004B93RDS", "B001AR0D4A", "B00HWWUQYY", "B0009X75J2", "B000K7VHQ4", "B00004W46I", "B00009ATIX", "B000SFJ4K4", "B000HC2LZS", "B000KGGIV4", "B003BJO8KU", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00008438U", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B001BSBBNK", "6305090564", "B000BUNZY2", "B006VRRGNK", "079073639X", "B0074JOUHE", "B00AEBBA72", "B00J5LXMTG", "B000C20VNM", "B001A4VH3Y", "B00JL6L4UY", "B000063UR0", "B00079HZS4", "B00AEFXT7W", "B002BFBB4Q", "0783226063", "B000MX7V70", "0783231032", "B00005Y6XR", "B00BTYPW7C", "B00006JDRG", "0783240961", "1558908846", "B0013LL2Z2"], "bought_together": ["B0045HCJSA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0045HCJSA", "B001BGS17Q", "B00AIBZMD6", "B0090SI56Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14168}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.26, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JKLZ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RZF2PBJAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Time Machine"}
{"description": "The key component of this Vista Series DVD is a six-part documentary about the making of the film from idea to theatrical release. M. Night Shyamalan talks at length about the film and his filmmaking technique in this exclusive one-hour feature.

Because Shyamalan works so leanly, the five deleted scenes are excellent, including a chilling scene from the film's final act. Also included are storyboard comparisons and another glimpse of one of Shyamalan's early home movies.Signsis the first of the Vista Series to be a single disc and the extras seem light, but there are only a couple of quibbles: the director again does not provide a commentary track and there is no DTS soundtrack.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004BZIY", "B00064LJVE", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00003CXQA", "B000JLTR8Q", "B004SIP92O", "B00AEFYYH6", "B003102JDC", "B00005JNTI", "B00000G3PA", "B002GHHHKQ", "B003Y5H4SO", "B0002DB54A", "B00008G8M4", "B00AEBBA2W", "B0000648X0", "630471193X", "B002O3Z50G", "B00011CZRE", "B000PHVZNE", "B0087ZG7HK", "B002NZK5SM", "B00004XPPG", "B00005JOC9", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B0021L8UXA", "0783225733", "B0006L0LOS", "B0006SGYL0", "B000NOKFHQ", "B005LAIHXQ", "0800177029", "6305767866", "B00004TS0G", "6304711891", "B00AEFY3MC", "B002GIBVVG", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000U1ZV8K", "B00005JNY3", "B00070FX5U", "B00AEBB8NI", "B0002KVUKM", "B00008G8LY", "B000F6IOAM", "B00005JN0T", "B00AEBBA36", "B002LMV7R0", "B002NZK5UU", "B0013FDM7E", "B002O3Z4WK", "B0068FZ0GK", "B00015YVDG", "B000LC55F2", "B00001ZWUS", "B002GHHHL0", "B000BTJDGC", "B000EHRVOW", "B0087ZG7J8", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00005JN2Z", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEFXSLE", "B00019073K", "B00005LC4D", "B00005JL78", "B00IBKXSKA", "B004EPYZPS", "B00000JDIQ", "B00AEBB9WI", "B000RIWAVW", "0780618548", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00005JN0W", "B00AEFXNLY", "6305428115", "0767811100", "0800141601", "B00AEFXT1S", "0780631536", "B00000IQC4", "B004P7CNUY", "B001GCUO02", "B002AS464Q", "B00003CWS3", "B00006FDCD", "B000FS9FCG", "B00005JKZH", "B000067FP8", "B000K7VHQE", "B00BEIYG98", "B00005JNNT", "B000068NNU", "B000XT1P4S", "B0087ZG7PW", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B002I9Z8BM", "B00AEFXKUI", "B0010X73ZG", "B00003CXIP"], "bought_together": ["B00004BZIY", "B004SIP92O"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004BZIY", "B00386EZUY", "B000QUU4M8", "B0000VCZK2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 11300}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.99, "brand": "Touchstone Video", "asin": "B00005JL3T", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51c02AOAyCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Signs"}

{"description": "WithThe Return of the King, the greatest fantasy epic in film history draws to a grand and glorious conclusion. Director Peter Jackson's awe-inspiring adaptation of the Tolkien classicThe Lord of the Ringscould never fully satisfy those who remain exclusively loyal to Tolkien's expansive literature, but as a showcase for physical and technical craftsmanship it is unsurpassed in pure scale and ambition, setting milestone after cinematic milestone as the brave yet charmingly innocent Hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood) continues his mission to Mordor, where he is destined to destroy the soul-corrupting One Ring of Power in the molten lava of Mount Doom. While the heir to the kingdom of Men, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), endures the massive battle at Minas Tirith with the allegiance of the elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom), dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and the great wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), Frodo and stalwart companion Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) must survive the schizoid deceptions of Gollum, who remains utterly convincing as a hybrid of performance (by Andy Serkis) and subtly nuanced computer animation.Jackson and cowriters Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens have much ground to cover; that they do so with intense pacing and epic sweep is impressive enough, but by investing greater depth and consequence in the actions of fellow Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), they ensure thatReturn of the Kingmaintains the trilogy's emphasis on intimate fellowship. While several major characters appear only briefly, and one (Christopher Lee's evil wizard, Saruman) relegated entirely to the extended version on DVD, Jackson is to be commended for his editorial acumen; like Legolas the archer, his aim as a filmmaker is consistently true, and he remains faithful to Tolkien's overall vision. IfReturnsuffers from too many endings, as some critic suggested, it's only because the epic's conclusion is so loyally inclusive of the actors--most notably Astin--who gave it such strength to begin with. By ending theLOTRtrilogy with noble integrity and faith in the power of imaginative storytelling,The Return of the King, like its predecessors, will stand as an adventure for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B002ZG980U", "B002PMV9FG", "B008UZA8FY", "B001NGML48", "B00005JM5E", "B001GZ6QC4", "B005COPWZW", "B008M4C1EO", "B00HFFE8HE", "039548930X", "B000W7F5SS", "B000I0RQVI", "B002VWNIDG", "B000E6EK2Y", "B001BYMX4A", "B004M1A21K", "B007K3JFUQ", "B001DHXT20", "B001UV4XHY", "0345325818", "B003Y5H54W", "B00005JNJV", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000A3XY5A", "B004LWZWGA", "B000U7WV1Y", "B005LXQLRW", "B001OQCV6A", "B000E8M0VA", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000EHRVMY", "0618640150", "B003ZK99NQ", "B0013FDM7E", "B00005JPH2", "B000UNYK4E", "B009JBWOU0", "B00003CX5P", "B00008G8M5", "B00GKOJ98E", "B004LWZW42", "B000H30B2C", "B000P0J0C4", "B00CZDLGDU", "B000M341QE", "B00008G8M4", "B000FKO5QK", "B00HWWUQYY", "B007SPPANM", "B008JFUO72", "B001DJLD1M", "0345538374", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00005JKCH", "B004SIP9U6", "B000YGGNMO", "B00E5I2M9K", "0618126988", "B005OCFGTO", "B00E8S2JZ4", "6305313687", "B004AKCME8", "B0002KVUKM", "B000AARKOO", "B0006GAO5Y", "B000K7VHQ4", "B002ZG997C", "B00AHTYI5M", "B008JFUS0U", "B0042MEQVG", "B00275EGWY", "B00E9PMML2", "B008UZDXEW", "B004SIP7F8", "B00116GEJS", "B00003CXI1", "B003ZKBELG", "B003Y5H5EW", "B000V4UFZK", "B0007PLLBU", "B001DTPZNY", "B002O3Z50Q", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000LP6KNU", "B005G4TJUC", "B00AW0KHTM", "B002ZG97YM", "054792819X", "B00AEFXZJE", "B0000YEEGM", "B002IPFWTE", "B001ECQ75A", "B000065U1N", "B0051MKNV8", "B000W796OM", "B00J49R1BY"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HFFE8HE", "B00003CWT6", "B00005JKZV", "B00BEZTMFY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1589}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JKZY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HS7iSFv5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)"}

Jimmy Tong (Jackie Chan) is a well-meaning but clumsy New York City cab driver who is tapped by Steena (Debi Mazar), associate to multi-millionaire Clark Devlin (Jason Isaacs), for a new job as Devlin's personal limo driver. After a mysterious accident lands Devlin in the hospital, Tong learns that his new boss has a secret - when he's not wheeling and dealing in high finance, Devlin is also a secret agent for the CSA, a top-level security agency. The secret to Devlin's success as a spy is his trademark tuxedo, a suit which is loaded with special gadgets which turns him into a high-tech fighting machine. After Tong dons the tuxedo and is transformed into a martial arts master, he takes over for Devlin and discovers that the agent's injuries didn't happen by accident. As Tong tries to chase down a handful of international super-villains bent on world conquest, he has to deal with Devlin's new partner, Del Blaine (Jennifer Love Hewitt), a CSA rookie who is just as baffled by her new assignment as Tong. The Tuxedo marked the feature-film debut for director Kevin Donovan, who had previously won international acclaim for his work in television commercials.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000SX9N2", "B002ZG99M2", "B0002S64TQ", "B005CFBZFW", "B000Y11BC6", "0767819640", "0780619331", "B000006A17", "B000I2KOB0", "B00HVFA37C", "0767851161", "B006LOC01G", "B001BEK8HO", "B00005JLRQ", "B000VUDSH6", "B004U7MR1O", "B000EWBKIK", "B0051SFTGQ", "B000UNYK3U", "B00H4KQMX8", "B00003CXJ1", "078062260X", "B000BXJ1X8", "B00005YUNV", "B004SUDQAY", "B004V2S4V0", "B00003CXWM", "B004H83IOQ", "B0000A9GHD", "B000WGYMTC", "B002ZG99MC", "B002GSXKO2", "B004SUDQ4K", "0780622677", "B004TP55XY", "B005ZMBEXA", "B000EQ45CO", "B000UXOM88", "B004TJWDNA", "B00BNADY8Q", "B000AC7OY8", "B00005JLYW", "B004SUDPZU", "B00003CY5Y", "B00BLN4V46", "B004QDW2DA", "B003JJGBXY", "B00016MSV2", "B001BEK8GA", "B0000U0X1Q", "B002GOAH1A", "B005FQ1OOK", "B000OT6V64", "B000RJO56E", "B002A5EBMQ", "B000085EFK", "B000BVM1QO", "B00AWHDEIQ", "B003Y5HWIQ", "B0000TPA2E", "B0009DWL8W", "B000VSDN2I", "B000Q7ZKWK", "B004CJQVO4", "B00004STRE", "B000O76ZOO", "B00D9EJG5E", "B000NA21SG", "B00000F2MG", "B002GHHHL0", "B00AHQQHFE", "B0002VEUV2", "B000071ZZJ", "B00005V1WW", "B008NP4ZUU", "B000AYEL3I", "B000RBA6C4", "B000803BQC", "B0000A2ZU1", "B004SIP8TS", "0790736411", "B00IXMF2K0", "B00008IHUC", "B0056NEK1G", "B00GDDNFDW", "B000274T94", "B00008WJE4", "B0080QOL0Q", "B000XPU66U", "B000069CF0", "B004U7MR0K", "B001CC7PLM", "B00K7IPGS6", "B00FLCYIAA", "B00441GYY2", "B005KK2FWG", "B009Z4AAK2", "B00005V5NQ", "B00BUC4TJ0"], "bought_together": ["B0000SX9N2", "B002ZG99M2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002ZG99M2", "B0002S64TQ", "B000Y11BC6", "B004H83IOQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 93079}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.74, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JL8Z", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519587FWPGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Tuxedo (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Conventional wisdom prior to season one ofThe West Wingwas that the only successful television shows were half hour sitcoms and hour long police, legal, or medical dramas. Building on surplus ideas from his filmThe American Presidentand the walk-and-talk style of comedy and drama from his critically acclaimed television showSports Night, Aaron Sorkin bucked the trend and created his masterpiece, one of the most memorable American political depictions to reach the big or small screen. Season one introduces viewers to a Nobel Prize-winning economist and unabashed intellectual president Jed Bartlet (Martin Sheen) and his key staff members, a newly elected Democratic administration trying to find its footing amidst the corridors of the White House's west wing. To the credit of its cast and their brilliant ensemble acting,The West Wingmanages to immediately conjure nearly a dozen distinct and memorable characters. Perhaps the greatest star of all is Sorkin's rapid-fire dialogue, especially as delivered by Press Secretary C.J. Craig (Alison Janney), Deputy Chief of Staff Josh Lyman (Bradley Whitford), Deputy Communications Director Sam Seaborn (Rob Lowe), and Chief of Staff Leo McGarry (John Spencer). They carry on conversations while stalking purposefully and unhaltingly down corridors, around corners, and through doorways, and all of it unfurls with the choreographic precision of a classical ballet and the pace of an Olympic ping-pong rally.What emerges is more than a collective liberal dream of an impassioned administration battling back ultra-conservative bogeymen ranging from the religious right to bigots to gun-toting militants. Wonderful episodes like \"The Pilot\" and \"In Excelsis Deo\" portray a government led by heroic, intelligent, and decent men and women. Whether or not one regards that as a political fantasy, it's a remarkably refreshing and appealing vision of politics and its practitioners, one that the public embraced with consistently strong television ratings. In a country whose citizens are used to viewing their elected leaders with mistrust and cynicism, that might beThe West Wing's greatest accomplishment.--Eugene Wei", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001HAGQK", "B0002WZN9Y", "B0007OY2N0", "B000BB1MIM", "B000EGEJI4", "B000HC2LHQ", "B00G4DOLQ6", "B00AZRDGGI", "B001KGDNAW", "B00G4DOJHM", "B000YABIQ6", "B00005JPI6", "B00005JLFT", "B00G4DOMK6", "B000HC2LI0", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B000EHSVBE", "B0092QH902", "B000HT3P56", "B0018CWEZI", "B00J5LXT44", "B000FTCF9A", "B000RF1QE2", "B00005JO9J", "B003L77G10", "B003FSTN52", "B005SEDI5M", "B00188XHF8", "B00GHH9HUE", "B000GPPNO2", "0783227973", "B002BWQ4C8", "B0053O89YM", "B001VPJZ0E", "B00KHA99BY", "B001MVWRNE", "B001ECDVK4", "B000CNE0RO", "B00ITAQ2T6", "B000A9QKSM", "B00A8KJN8M", "B00ECGHM5O", "B0013DZNAA", "B001B187BQ", "B000YW8RPE", "B00BTYJYR6", "B003UD7JC6", "B000NA1PUG", "B00369ERC4", "B000FTCLSU", "B000BOH98G", "B003F3NE1Q", "B001O4KBO6", "B001D2WUDE", "B000BITUKC", "B000YGGNGK", "B00005JNJ1", "B000067S1G", "B00876PLNK", "B001GLX6UI", "B000TGURZ8", "B003L77G42", "B001VPJZ0O", "B000BO7DWI", "B005PYL4VU", "B000CNE0T2", "B001DJLCRC", "B000FIMG5Y", "B00B5J6A7W", "B001MVWRMU", "B000BOH8YQ", "B00HNGC516", "B009M7PR5A", "B000YKYT1M", "B000BOH986", "B00000K0DQ", "B005DDC4XK", "B002N5N4NA", "B0093I913W", "B003R0MEW2", "B001ECDVJU", "B00005JLIC", "B00005JNOG", "B00684J49U", "B0092QHXZS", "B0002ERXC2", "B001F7Q4JS", "B004QOB8O8", "B0073U2EWM", "B000MCH5AO", "B00GPWEPZ8", "B000CEXEWA", "B008BLCP0S", "B00FM4S8H6", "B00BVMXBDO", "B0018CWEXK", "B007MDB6Y2", "B0038M2APA", "B002AMUDK8"], "bought_together": ["B0001HAGQK", "B0002WZN9Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000HC2LI0", "B0002WZN9Y", "B0001HAGQK", "B0007OY2N0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7957}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 18.59, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JLF3", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510LCVOPLpL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The West Wing: Season 1"}
{"description": "With its disturbing images and a few good shocks,The Ringis the kind of frightfest you'll watch to set a chilling mood or spook your susceptible friends, but when you try to sort it out, this well-mounted American remake (of the 1998 Japanese hitRingu, based on Koji Suzuki's popular novel) becomes a batch of incoherent parts. The negligible plot follows a Seattle reporter (Naomi Watts) as she investigates the death of her niece, the victim of a mysterious videotape that, according to urban legend, causes the viewer's death seven days later. (Fear Dot Comborrowed the same idea while avoiding this film's lofty pretensions.) The countdown structure follows the reporter, her son, and her estranged boyfriend into deepening layers of terror--all quite effective until the movie attempts to explain itself. At that you're better off shutting down your brain and letting the creepy visuals take over.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009X763M", "B0006SGYL0", "B004SIP92O", "B00001QGUM", "B00151QYOO", "B001P3SA9Y", "B009XTF8KQ", "B004LWZW24", "B00004BZIY", "B0021L8UFI", "B001JNNDJM", "B000V4UFZK", "B000PMLJMQ", "B0021L8UPS", "B000TJ6PBK", "B0019X3YX2", "B00005RHGK", "B00BEIYMAG", "B0026LQM2Q", "B00005JNJR", "B003UGLCIA", "B000IHY9TS", "B002VWNIDG", "B00AIBZLVY", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00006FDCD", "B008JFUNYG", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00B96TGQS", "B00005JL3T", "B000BTJDGC", "B00AJLHUA8", "B000OVLBGM", "B000RIWAVW", "B003VA3JUO", "B00DW5IM14", "B00005JNY3", "B0021L8UXA", "B00008LUNW", "B000F6IOAM", "B001D2WU9I", "B002JT69IW", "B000AA4JL6", "B00174RCHW", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B00386EZUY", "B0000VCZMK", "B00018D42W", "B0000E2R6P", "B0006SSOHC", "B001U0HBQA", "B00004TS0G", "B003L20IEW", "B008F283VS", "B001DJLD1W", "B0053TWVDC", "B00007G1ZB", "B0015ET3YO", "B00011CZRE", "B004LWZW2O", "B002ZG971U", "B000088NQR", "B002LMSWN2", "B00AEFXSLE", "B0000648X0", "B00005JOWW", "B00005JNNT", "B0031U8OEK", "B006CXIKYC", "B001MVYUR0", "B004SIP9P6", "B003UN0752", "B001NPD9LS", "B008WAM2E2", "B001B1UO6W", "B000GBEWRU", "B00AZTUUQK", "B0002DB54A", "B004SIP9O2", "0780631684", "B003LR5BD0", "B000GCFO0I", "B000VKL6Z2", "B005CFBYW6", "B008G33PIM", "B000GSYRY6", "B0010X73ZG", "B000AM4P9K", "B000A5045Q", "B000056T5E", "B005TK23PQ", "B004BLJQOK", "0783116926", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00BEIYG98", "B005LAIGOQ", "B0097C046W", "B0013FDM7E", "B00BEIYGT8", "B0001FR3IQ"], "bought_together": ["B0009X763M", "B0006SGYL0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004LWZW24", "B000V4UFZK", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00005JNY3"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 99771}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.79, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JLTK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MKWPKHSTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Ring (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "All on a single disc,The League of Extraordinary Gentlemenoffers two commentary tracks, 12 deleted and extended scenes, and a 54-minute documentary. The track by the two producers and three of the actors is informative, but surprisingly interesting is the track by the film's technicians, particularly costume designer Jacqueline West, whose passion for her craft is infectious.  Unfortunately, the film's two biggest selling points--thegraphic novelthat inspired it and the marquee star, Sean Connery--don't get sufficient attention.  The documentary acknowledges the graphic novel but doesn't really discuss it, concentrating on examinations of the costumes and special effects (e.g., Mr. Hyde was done without CGI).  Connery's involvement consists of a few sound bites at the beginning of some of the documentary chapters.  He and producer Don Murphy explain that he turned downThe Lord of the RingsandThe Matrixbecause he didn't understand them, but even though he wasn't sure he understoodLXG, he wasn't going to turn it down.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002KVUKM", "B0009MDPYM", "B001AK3S4Y", "B001F7MSFM", "B00AEFXCLU", "B002GOAH1A", "B0006IIPIK", "B0000959N0", "6304711891", "B0007P0Y7C", "B003HKN52U", "B000FGGE68", "B003M987PQ", "B006VRRGNK", "B004EPZ07K", "1558908846", "B0002J4X1Q", "B001DHXT20", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B007K3JFUQ", "B008JFUS0U", "B002GHHHL0", "B000OVLBF8", "B00AEFYGBA", "B00005JNTU", "B001OQCV6A", "B000069I1I", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000ENC5YW", "B0006L0LOS", "B000VI70QS", "B00IKM5LXG", "B003Y5H5EW", "0800195175", "B0090SI56Y", "B00005JLQN", "B00070FX5U", "B005LAIH54", "B002A5EBMQ", "B000B8GT92", "B000MX7V70", "B0045HCJGC", "B000ASATYY", "B001CDR1FG", "B001GCUO0W", "B004LWZW42", "B001VLFE7G", "B004SEUIWY", "B003Q6D2B4", "B00004Z4WR", "B009MF5BXK", "B00151QYXU", "B00003CXSD", "B002GSXKNI", "B005LAIGW8", "B002ZG99KO", "B000035Z38", "0767834739", "B00005JN0T", "B002ZG999U", "B00E5I2MEK", "B00E5I2M9K", "B0013FDM7E", "B002ZG97CO", "B0002IQMAM", "B00BTYOYG2", "B008JFURII", "B008JFUO72", "B0013J55B6", "B001HQZJMU", "B000EQHXN2", "B000OVLBHG", "B009MO57H6", "B000AP04FG", "B00008K76U", "B000WC39LI", "6304712499", "B005LAIHYU", "B008JFUPPI", "B0016Q2D5M", "B00006JDVV", "B00111YM5G", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B000I0RQVI", "B000CEXGAU", "B000056PMU", "B001QTXM5Y", "B0000VJG72", "B005LAIH2C", "B00I9TDMRM", "B00005JM5E", "B00008EYA5", "B002ZG99G8", "B00007AJE1", "B000H30B2C", "B002NXSRVG", "B00195FUDC", "B001QB9H1U", "B0006GANOQ", "B001DJLD1M"], "bought_together": ["B0002KVUKM", "B0009MDPYM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002KVUKM", "B00005JLXE", "B001F7MSFM", "B002ZG98LO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12054}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.68, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00005JM5B", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KDD84NPVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Like any DVD blockbuster from producer Jerry Bruckheimer, the extras are plentiful and often a bit too self-congratulatory (worst offender here is the primary commentary track). The slickly (natch) produced making-of documentary goes through the standard routine; however, the less-flashy \"fly on the wall\" bits--just showing what happens on set without comment--is more fun, offering effortless insight on the filmmaking process. The best treasure is a nifty interactive history on pirates with plenty of background material. You can simply play the filmed segments or take a tour around a ship to discover the material (and a few surprises). There's a lot of archival material on the theme-park ride that inspired the film and several odds and ends including an enjoyable chronicle of the vintage ship's voyage from its home harbor to the movie set. The kids should really dig the DVD-ROM \"Moonlight Becomes Ye,\" in which they can turn their own mug into a ghostly pirate. There's also a bounty of extended and deleted scenes (19 in all) and a very funny blooper reel. With both DTS and Dolby 5.1, sound systems will get a workout with the excellent (and loud) sound design.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000I0RQVI", "B000U7WV1Y", "B005COPWZW", "B004A8ZWUQ", "B00005JN5E", "B0013BM63O", "B006VRRGNK", "B00005JKZV", "B00005JPH2", "B0014Z4OMU", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00003CWT6", "B004DTLK80", "B00005JKZY", "B0000A1RJI", "B004M1A21K", "B004DTLK7G", "B00003CXZ1", "B001HN694K", "B001E75QH0", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00005JKCH", "B0087ZG7HK", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B000E6EK2Y", "B000E8M0VA", "B003UYUQZW", "B00AEFYGBA", "B000W746GK", "B00005JMQW", "B0083SBMBM", "B001DHXT20", "B0002234LS", "B000W7F5SS", "B002PMV9FG", "B0002KVUKM", "B004EPYZUS", "B0053FANRC", "B00BEZTMFY", "6304806434", "B000VR0570", "0783231644", "B001OQCV6A", "B000AYELVA", "B008JFUO72", "B005G4TJUC", "B00004R99S", "B00023B1LC", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00003CXI1", "B001HQZJMU", "B00000IRE6", "B0002ZDVEU", "B008QE9XD2", "B00F84H73Q", "B00E5I2MEK", "B003Y5H5EW", "B007K3JFUQ", "B003QO8TOQ", "B000NQRR1Q", "B000YPUF9W", "B001EZE5BU", "B004A8ZWSS", "B0009MDPYM", "B00LG6YEKE", "B002ZG980U", "B002ZG994U", "B000U1ZV8K", "B001DZ8TRW", "B00005JLR2", "B000VWYJ86", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00000JQB5", "B004XKCZAG", "B000W796OM", "B001GCUO0W", "B00AQSN7HE", "B00000ILDH", "B0053FANT0", "B0000VAFO0", "B0002IQMAM", "B000HRMAPE", "B004LWZW7Y", "B008UZA8FY", "B0001HLVS2", "B00007AJGH", "B00005JNJV", "B003YAR97K", "B00CHVJODE", "B000UR9T8C", "B0049IHX2C", "B000G6BLW4", "B00177YA1K", "0783227345", "B0014Z4ON4", "B001TK80C0", "B002O5M4T4", "B00AEBBA72", "B00005JOC9"], "bought_together": ["B000I0RQVI", "B000U7WV1Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005COPWZW", "B000I0RQVI", "B0071JADFU", "B00005JPFX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6260}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.23, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JM5E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51fX40gGdXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "Based on the perennial nonfiction bestseller by H.G. Bissinger,Friday Night Lightslooks at high school football in the harsh light of reality, finding heart and hardness while stirring our emotions. Actor-director Peter Berg (Very Bad Things, The Rundown) is Bissinger's cousin; he knows the material well, and understands how an obsession with winning turns high school kids into somber, over-pressured gladiators--expendable soldiers in a community war against shame and obscurity. The fact-based story focuses on the 1988 football season of Odessa-Permian high school in West Texas, and as a fast-paced sports movie, Berg delivers the goods with a rousing, frenetically styled crowd-pleaser. But there's darkness in this tale of weary underdogs, including an abusive father (well-played by country music star Tim McGraw), threatening townsfolk, an injured star running back (Derek Luke), a tormented quarterback (Lucas Black), and the melancholy coach (Billy Bob Thornton) who takes his team to the finals. Berg's film could use less flashy cutting and more drama to support its gridiron intensity, butFriday Night Lightsoffers a refreshing alternative to the conventional sports movie, and makes a perfect triple-feature with the equally exciting documentariesGo Tigers!andThe Last Game.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JPBO", "B00AEBB9UU", "B000056VP4", "B005CA4SOM", "B002NZK5QO", "B000J3OTT6", "B000EXZFCQ", "B00004W221", "6305428492", "B000KHYN9C", "0306809907", "B00AEFXOKO", "B002VECM6S", "B0001US66Y", "B001LGXIA6", "B00E1HIXFW", "B0032UYFAQ", "B004BFTFBU", "B003L77GCE", "0792843592", "B001RXDM2C", "B00B83N2NU", "B0014DO5XU", "B000RF1QE2", "B002O3Z4XY", "B000068NNU", "B00AEFYJI0", "B009YQJ2Q4", "B000A0GP0Y", "B000649YAM", "B00008EY60", "B000MNOX94", "1935618563", "B000FVR1T2", "B000GAKDAG", "B00AEFXJY0", "B009NNM9OA", "B001FB55NK", "B000ARTN3I", "630529142X", "B00002SSKG", "B00AEBB9AA", "630514415X", "0201196778", "B0060ZJ7BC", "B00553K9IA", "B00000G3PA", "B00004Z4WR", "6305313687", "B003UESJHO", "B00AEFYKWU", "0800141741", "B00028HBES", "B0002S94CK", "B0000AC8LH", "B00004RE45", "B000TZJBPQ", "B00009OWJV", "B000274T94", "B00005JLRZ", "B001G5T6GW", "B00AEBBA36", "B00004Y2R1", "B000035Z59", "B0068FZ0GK", "B000Y7WGOW", "B004KPLVX6", "B004GJYROG", "B00004TJQJ", "B003UESJ9M", "B000M4RG42", "B00AEBB86A", "B005OZVXCU", "B006X08ET0", "B00005JM10", "B00005JLG1", "B002GIBVVQ", "B00003CXTG", "B002ZG99N6", "B001FB55L2", "B00AEBBA2M", "0800177258", "B00003CXNY", "6304765258", "B000VG66XS", "B002YMWQ2M", "B000WZEZGI", "B0002J4YVK", "B0007LLPXI", "B004GJYRF0", "B000F4RH84", "B000F6ZIIS", "B000068QPY", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B002T4GWWA", "B0034G4P94", "B000NO39FG", "B000ADWDE8", "B00003GPFT", "B0000633U2"], "bought_together": ["B000056VP4", "B00005JPBO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004GXKBF6", "0306809907", "B000056VP4", "B005CA4SOM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7523}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.89, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JNEW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X7RX6KY3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Friday Night Lights (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Jamie Foxx's uncannily accurate performance isn't the only good thing aboutRay. Riding high on a wave of Oscar buzz, Foxx proved himself worthy of all the hype by portraying blind R&B; legend Ray Charles in a warts-and-all performance that Charles approved shortly before his death in June 2004. Despite a few dramatic embellishments of actual incidents (such as the suggestion that the accidental drowning of Charles's younger brother caused all the inner demons that Charles would battle into adulthood), the film does a remarkable job of summarizing Charles's strengths as a musical innovator and his weaknesses as a philandering heroin addict who recorded some of his best songs while flying high as a kite. Foxx seems to be channeling Charles himself, and as he did with the life of Ritchie Valens in La Bamba, director Taylor Hackford gets most of the period details absolutely right as he chronicles Ray's rise from \"chitlin circuit\" performer in the early '50s to his much-deserved elevation to legendary status as one of the all-time great musicians. Foxx expertly lip-syncs to Ray Charles' classic recordings, but you could swear he's the real deal in a film that honors Ray Charles without sanitizing his once-messy life.--Jeff ShannonMore on Ray CharlesModern Sounds in Country and Western Music(CD)The Genius of Ray Charles(CD)Ray Charles and Betty Carter--Dedicated to You(CD)Genius & Soul--The 50th Anniversary Collection(CD)Ray: A Tribute to the Movie, the Music, and the Man(book)More Albums by Ray Charles", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000E8QVWY", "B001P3SA94", "B00465I1CE", "B00005JKMQ", "6305428409", "B003BV8I3Q", "B00AEFXTKO", "B0002LE9HC", "B000BOH8X2", "B00AEFYG3S", "0790739313", "B000JJSL1W", "B000A50460", "B00005TQ44", "0783230524", "B0009R1TJ0", "0780627822", "B00AEFZ63M", "B000P0J092", "B002VWNICM", "B00EV4EUT8", "B000JLTRH2", "B000N6U0E2", "B0041QSZS8", "0783237367", "078324228X", "B00AEFY6TW", "B003HKN534", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00007AJG1", "B00007L4KF", "B00ANDDBBY", "B000BITV9W", "0783114907", "B00007AJG2", "1558908390", "B00005JLRZ", "B000FVQLQQ", "6305692572", "0767821637", "B002CA68NO", "B00AFEXRME", "B002CPMB9O", "B004SIP93S", "B000063JDI", "B00005NB8K", "B00125WAWS", "6305505780", "B000IFRT4W", "B001TUZGPO", "B009NNM9OA", "B000RB6XG2", "B000P0J0CY", "B0001FR3IQ", "B000FVQLRA", "B00066FAVW", "B002XMGGK6", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00DW5IL2E", "B00005JPK8", "0767811070", "B000I0QL7I", "B000069I0E", "B00080ZG10", "0306814315", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00049QQHI", "B00000JGHV", "B0007CEXYK", "B0001Q4BOE", "B0000YEE6M", "B000NIVJF4", "B008Y1YJN6", "B00066VTU8", "B001132GNY", "B0006QAIG4", "B0034G4OSG", "B000C20VRS", "0800141741", "B00A2H9QN8", "B000Y11B8K", "B00005LB86", "B000056VP4", "B00005JL72", "B000095J01", "B000Q7ZNZ4", "B002CAWNEM", "B003UESJHO", "B00066FAQW", "0783230389", "B0013FDM7E", "B00007ELEO", "B00AMEZDJW", "B000P0J0CE", "B003Y5H4ZC", "0767821955", "B00003GPFT", "B0021L8V2A"], "bought_together": ["B000E8QVWY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002LE9HC", "B000E8QVWY", "B000BOH8X2", "B00AZMFJYA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17277}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.89, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JND5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41RQ8ETK19L._SX300_.jpg", "title": "Ray (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Despite super effects, a huge budget, and the cinematic pedigree of alien-happy Steven Spielberg, this take on H.G. Wells's novel is basically a horror film packaged as a sci-fi thrill ride. Instead of a mad slasher, however, Spielberg (along with writers Josh Friedman & David Koepp) utilizes aliens hell-bent on quickly destroying humanity, and the terrifying results that prey upon adult fears, especially in the post-9/11 world. The realistic results could be a new genre, the grim popcorn thriller; often you feel like you're watching Schindler's List more than Spielberg's other thrill-machine movies (Jaws,Jurassic Park). The film centers on Ray Ferrier, a divorced father (Tom Cruise, oh so comfortable) who witnesses one giant craft destroy his New Jersey town and soon is on the road with his teen son (Justin Chatwin) and preteen daughter (Dakota Fanning) in tow, trying to keep ahead of the invasion. The film is, of course, impeccably designed and produced by Spielberg's usual crew of A-class talent. The aliens are genuinely scary, even when the film--like the novel--spends a good chunk of time in a basement. Readers of the book (or viewers of the deft 1953 adaptation) will note the variation of whom and how the aliens come to Earth, which poses some logistical problems. The film opens and closes with narration from the novel read by Morgan Freeman, but Spielberg could have adapted Orson Welles's words from the famous Halloween Eve 1938 radio broadcast: \"We couldn't soap all your windows and steal all your garden gates by tomorrow night, so we did the best next thing: we annihilated the world.\"--Doug ThomasWar of the Worldsat Amazon.comThe SoundtrackThe War of the Worlds(1953)War of the Worlds - The Complete First Season(TV series)Classic Sci-Fi Movies and Their RemakesAliens Invade on DVDThe Prog-rock Opera (no kidding)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B00005JL78", "B001SGEUYW", "B00008G8M4", "B00005JL3T", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AEFXNLY", "B00005JMXX", "B001OQCV2E", "B000VECAD0", "B002O3Z510", "B0002V7OI8", "B000H30B2C", "B000EGDB10", "B00005JN2Z", "B005LAIIMG", "B005PTYP70", "B002O3Z50G", "B0002V7ON8", "B00005JN0T", "B00K2CHW48", "B002SJIO4A", "0783225547", "B008JFUO36", "B00005JKLZ", "B00AS1Q93S", "1936594056", "B004EPYZUS", "B001TUZG4K", "B00AEFXR1K", "B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFXYJA", "0767817478", "B0034G4ORC", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00070FX5U", "B0045HCJSA", "B00000G3PA", "B005LAIHPE", "B003Y5H5GK", "B00AEBBA72", "B00003CWU3", "B00I9TDMRM", "B001ECDVKE", "B00003CXXP", "B000V4UFZK", "B0010X73ZG", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00005JKFR", "B000XT1P4S", "B003HKN52U", "B0009PW4D2", "B000HRMAPE", "B004EPYZPS", "B0018QPPXW", "B0002WZTOI", "B00AEBB9LO", "B004LWZW4M", "B003ABZHAO", "B003YJFALS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B000OT6V64", "B004P7CN7W", "B000CCBC9O", "B00000ILDD", "0767803434", "B001L57ZYM", "B000065V3G", "B007STBUHI", "B002ZG980U", "B008JFUQZ2", "B00005B6JZ", "B0006GANOQ", "B000F1IQN2", "1494343576", "B001GCUO02", "B00004Y87O", "0783226810", "B004EPYZSK", "B000P0J0BU", "B005LAIHXQ", "B001680M26", "B000EQHXN2", "B0045HCJFS", "B00004BZIY", "B00008G8M5", "B00003CXQA", "B008JFUS0U", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00EIN6KJ0", "B0000DZ6N3", "B000MV8A9A", "B00005JKYX", "B0000YEEGM", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B0013FCWUW", "B002ZG9864", "B00003CWTI", "B008MIMWQW", "B00IKM5OCO"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBB8VK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B004LWZW4M", "B00005JL78", "B004EPYZSK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18739}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JNTI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51upxzPRnXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "War of the Worlds"}

{"description": "Marvel Comics' first family of superherodom, the Fantastic Four, hits the big screen in a light-hearted and funny adventure.  It begins when down-on-his-luck genius Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd,Horatio Hornblower) has to enlist the financial and intellectual help from former schoolmate and rival Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon,Nip/Tuck) in order to pursue outer-space research into human DNA.  Also on the trip are Reed's best friend, Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis,The Shield); his former lover, Sue Storm (Jessica Alba,Dark Angel,Sin City), who's now Doom's employee and love interest; and her hotshot-pilot brother, Johnny Storm (Chris Evans,Cellular).  Things don't go as planned, of course, and the quartet becomes blessed--or is it cursed?--with superhuman powers: flexibility, brute strength, invisibility and projecting force fields, and bursting into flame.  Meanwhile, Doom himself is undergoing a transformation.Among the many entries in the comic-book-movie frenzy,Fantastic Fouris refreshing because it doesn't take itself too seriously. Characterization isn't too deep, and the action is a bit sparse until the final reel (like most \"first\" superhero movies, it has to go through the \"how did we get these powers and what we will do with them\" churn). But it's a good-looking cast, and original comic-book cocreator Stan Lee makes his most significant Marvel-movie cameo yet, in a speaking role as the FF's steadfast postal carrier, Willie Lumpkin. Newcomers to superhero movies might find the idea of a family with flexibility, strength, invisibility, and force fields a retread ofThe Incredibles, but Pixar's animated film was very much a tribute to the FF and other heroes of the last 40 years. The irony is that whileFantastic Fouris an enjoyable B-grade movie, it's the tribute,The Incredibles, that turned out to be a film for the ages.--David HoriuchiOn the DVDThe principal extra on the DVD is a spirited commentary track by Jessica Alba, Michael Chiklis, and Ioan Gruffud.  Self-avowed FF fan Chiklis explains why the Thing doesn't have a craggy brow, Alba recalls which things were \"cool,\" and they talk about looking forward to the sequel. There are three short deleted scenes (including a goofy Wolverine reference), 20 minutes of barely watchable hand-held video footage from the press tour, music videos, and some short featurettes including an appearance by FF creator Stan Lee.--David HoriuchiThe Fantastic Four at Amazon.comComics and Graphic NovelsDisney animated seriesThe classic comic bookMovie tie-in graphic novelThe Xbox gameFantastic FourSoundtrackThe Fantastic CastJessica Albaas Sue StormMichael Chiklisas The ThingIoan Gruffuddas Reed RichardsChris Evansas Johnny StormStills fromFantastic Four(click for larger images)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000VI70QS", "B0000959N0", "B001DHXT20", "B0007P0Y7C", "B004EPZ07K", "B001CDR1FG", "B00E5I2MEK", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00E5I2MCM", "B000OVLBF8", "B00005JMQW", "B008JFUO72", "B004LWZW42", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000UR9T8C", "B0090SI56Y", "B000HEVZ9E", "B000HCO83Q", "B00005JKCH", "B005OY6LBE", "B001OQCVI8", "B008JFUS0U", "B004LWZWFQ", "B000AYELVU", "B0002IQMAM", "B003YAR97K", "B0083SBMBM", "B001QB9H1U", "B001AK3S4Y", "B005LAIGW8", "B000AYELVA", "B001F7MSFM", "B0006L0LOS", "B003H8F3AY", "B008JFUPFI", "B006DHAT5K", "B002GSXKN8", "B002ZG99G8", "B00005JNJV", "B002IPFWTE", "B002NXSRVG", "B000VR0570", "B0006D3HGA", "B004LWZWGA", "B005LAII44", "B000YV1Q2G", "B00F4FFO8E", "B005G4TJUC", "B00005JN0T", "B0007US7CQ", "B00E1HIXEI", "B000J10EQU", "B0002KVUKM", "B000VKL6T8", "B001TK80C0", "B002ZG99B8", "B000Y7U98C", "B002GSXKNI", "B00005JM5B", "B001GZ6QC4", "B000PFUAP0", "B00005JKWJ", "B0009P42WI", "B00174RCHW", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00005JKYX", "B005TK0MFE", "B000VNMMPW", "B001QTXM5Y", "B000EU1Q7M", "B00008G8M4", "B000P6XQ50", "B00005JN5E", "B0007V6ITE", "B001VLBDD0", "B005LAIH54", "B001FB55HQ", "B000IJ79WU", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B00561BNJK", "B001VLFE7G", "B000CNER1S", "B00K7IPFSM", "B001BP4K22", "B00005JL78", "B0001CNRS4", "B00979KQD6", "B00157OI9Q", "B004EPYZUS", "B002HWRYJE", "B009YQJ322", "B003Y5H5EW", "0780624890", "B001RHGRT8", "B0013J55B6", "B0013BM63O", "B0053FANPY", "B009MO57H6", "078401132X"], "bought_together": ["B000VI70QS", "B001DHXT20"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000VI28Z6", "B000VI70QS", "B008JFUS0U", "B0090SI56Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12162}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.98, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00005JNTU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AM4R5J04L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fantastic Four (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "The delightful designs of William Joyce (writer/illustrator of such popular children's books asGeorge ShrinksandBently & Egg) makeRobotsa joy to behold. The round, bouncy, and ramshackle forms of hero Rodney Copperbottom and his computer-animated friends are part of an ornate and daffyFender providing assistance.Rube-Goldberg universe of elaborate contraptions and gleaming metallic surfaces.  Rodney (voiced with a hint-of-Scottish lilt by Ewan McGregor) is a young inventor who sets off for Robot City to work for Big Weld (Mel Brooks), the supreme inventor of the mechanical world.  But upon his arrival, Rodney discovers that Big Weld has disappeared, and the slick, shiny Ratchet (Greg Kinnear,As Good As It Gets) is phasing out the spare parts that lumpen robots need to function and replacing them with \"upgrades\"--expensive and glistening new exoskeletons. Unfortunately, from this suitable beginning, the story degenerates into a series of action sequences that make very little sense, though some are kinetic and fun (though others are only there to serve the inevitableRobotsvideo game). Most kids will enjoy the sheer visual pleasure of the movie, but compared to the narrative richness of Pixar movies likeThe IncrediblesandToy Story, that pleasure is pretty short-lived. Also featuring the voices of Robin Williams, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Amanda Bynes, Jennifer Coolidge, and many, many more.--Bret FetzerDVD FeaturesJennifer Coolidge returns as the voice of Aunt Fanny in a mildly amusing new short, \"Aunt Fanny's Tour of Booty,\" which allows her to again be the butt of the joke.  Fans of the characters will enjoy both a 17-minute discussion of the robots' creation as well as profiles of 11 of the bots, including early, almost unrecognizable conceptual sketches and brief interviews with the voice cast.  The original short is fairly dull, and of the three deleted scenes, the most finished is an extended version of Rodney's initial meeting with Tim at the gate.  One other is in sketch form only but does preserve another performance by Robin Williams.  The kids' games are pretty good.  There's a dancing robot that will perform eight routines on command or in random order.  A memory game has a bit of replay value, and the build-a-bot segment takes some thought and investigation.  The Xbox demo is a nifty little diversion that transforms one element (the transport-pod race) of the full-length, single-player Xbox game into a frenetic one- to four-player free-for-all.In their commentary track, director Chris Wedge and producer-inspiration William Joyce have to remind each other to stop patting themselves on the back, but it is interesting to hear them talk about old games such as Mousetrap that played a part in developing the film.  (Wedge's frequent references to a possible \"director's cut\" might not seem like a joke to DVD buyers who have gotten tired of DVD rereleases.)  The commentary track by the Blue Sky technical team might be better, offering insights into the characters and the creation of the film without lapsing into too much techie-speak.--David HoriuchiStills fromRobots(click for larger image)The World ofRobotsThe Art of RobotsRobotssoundtrackRobotsscoreRobotsfor XboxRobotsfor PS2Robotsfor GBA", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006JMLRK", "B000M343BC", "B002WJI2QQ", "B001DPHDCY", "B0012EM5D8", "B004HO6I4M", "B00003CXJ4", "B00CWM58WY", "B000MV9026", "B0006UEVT0", "B001GCUO7A", "0783231474", "B005SDUV4E", "B000RMJ4F8", "B0000640SC", "B000ROAK2W", "B0013FSL3E", "B001LPWGFA", "B004EPZ034", "B001U3D88M", "B000ION23A", "B005LAIISA", "B0000AOX0O", "B000UFIYOO", "B001PR0YEE", "6305161887", "B00029LO0Y", "B008NNY9QW", "B000G75AZC", "B000H7JCK0", "B006JD48LO", "B000L22SG6", "B00B7EQPNE", "B001ECQ75A", "B004AKCME8", "B000AY74OG", "B000VBJEEG", "B00F522C7C", "B000DWMYQ8", "B002ZG97YM", "B008JFUQ16", "B004LWZW7Y", "B000BITUVG", "B0000VV4W2", "B005LAIH4A", "B00003CXG7", "B00005JMQZ", "B00007LVCM", "B0042U94UQ", "B00CHVJODE", "B001PR0Y7Q", "B00E9ZATJO", "B00009M9BK", "0449810798", "B0090SI1RM", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B001KVZ6FW", "1620575175", "B009AMAH3O", "B00I6JOD2S", "B000CZ0PT4", "B0013FSWT2", "B0034G4OYA", "B00AFEX83C", "B000UVKGPI", "B000065V42", "B0039N74CW", "B00JK531ES", "B00HLTD2OE", "B002ZG9904", "B00009YXAW", "6305123454", "B005FLSZQU", "B00005JM7T", "B001GCUNWQ", "B003UESJF6", "B00E00OGE2", "B001HN6918", "B000GUJZ00", "B00I0VTOMG", "B00005JNS0", "B00365F6I2", "B000EQ5UHS", "B000LPS2VI", "B00005JN4W", "B000B8QFYG", "B001NCDFTW", "B0030ZIZRC", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00G5G7EXY", "B007FF3HQM", "B00947N6D8", "B00EBBGLFC", "B005QODEEE", "B00ALMNCLQ", "B00362RUX4", "B00005JN0T", "B000GIXEWC", "B00005TN8K", "B005LAIIT4"], "bought_together": ["B00CWM58WY", "B004HO6I4M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00CWM58WY", "B004HO6I4M", "B002WJI2QQ", "B001DPHDCY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3335}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "Fox Home Entertainment", "asin": "B00005JNQS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61RM90ARRPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Robots (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Movies don't come any bigger than Peter Jackson'sKing Kong, a three-hour remake of the 1933 classic that marries breathtaking visual prowess with a surprising emotional depth. Expanding on the original story of the blonde beauty and the beast who falls for her, Jackson creates a movie spectacle that matches hisLord of the Ringsfilms and even at times evokes their fantasy world while celebrating the glory of '30s Hollywood. Naomi Watts stars as Ann Darrow, a vaudeville actress down on her luck in Depression-era New York until manic filmmaker Carl Denham (a game but miscast Jack Black) entices her with a lead role. Dazzled by the genius of screenwriter Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody), Ann boards the tramp steamer S.S.Venture, which she--and most of the wary crew--believes is headed for Singapore. Denham, however, is in search of the mythic Skull Island, hoping to capture its wonders on film and make a fortune. What he didn't count on were some scary natives who find that the comely Darrow looks like prime sacrifice material for a mysterious giant creature....There's no point in rehashing the entire plot, as every movie aficionado is more than familiar with the trajectory ofKing Kong; the challenge facing Jackson, his screenwriters, and the phenomenal visual-effects team was to breathe new life into an old, familiar story. To that degree, they achieve what could be best called a qualified success. Though they've assembled a crackerjack supporting cast, including Thomas Kretschmann as theVenture's hard-bitten captain and young Jamie Bell as a plucky crewman, the first third of the movie is rather labored, with too much minute detail given over to sumptuous re-creations of '30s New York and the unexciting initial leg of theVenture's sea voyage. However, once the film finds its way to Skull Island (which bears more than a passing resemblance toLOTR's Mordor),Kongturns into a dazzling movie triumph, by turns terrifying and awe-inspiring. The choreography and execution of the action set pieces--including one involving Kong and a trio of Tyrannosaurus Rexes, as well as another that could be charitably described as a bug-phobic's nightmare--is nothing short of landmark filmmaking, and a certain Mr. Spielberg should watch his back, asKongtrumps most anything that has come before it.Despite the visual challenges ofKing Kong, the movie's most difficult hurdle is the budding romance between Ann and her simian soulmate. Happily, this is where Jackson unqualifiedly triumphs, as this unorthodox love story is tenderly and humorously drawn, by turns sympathetic and wondrous. Watts, whose accessibility balances out her almost otherworldly loveliness, works wonders with mere glances, and Andy Serkis, who digitally embodies Kong here much as he did Gollum in theLOTRfilms, breathes vibrant life into the giant star of the film without ever overplaying any emotions. The final, tragic act of the film, set mostly atop the Empire State Building, is whereKongearns its place in movie history as a work that celebrates both the technical and emotional heights that film can reach.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"bought_together": ["B000EHQTZO", "B00AEFYEU8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EHQTZO", "B00AEFYEU8", "B0087ZG7HK", "0767817478"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 32487}, "categories": [["Movies & TV"]], "price": 8.94, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JO20", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513Y54TGdwL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "King Kong (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Based on the popular Colombian telenovelaYo Soy Betty La Fea,Ugly Bettyis a biting comedy with plenty of heart. There are several ongoing plots, including murder, illegal immigration, infidelity, a vendetta, and death. And yes, this really is a comedy. Golden Globe winner America Ferrera (The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,Real Women Have Curves) stars as Betty, a whip-smart assistant at a women's magazine who is clueless when it comes to fashion. While her size 0 colleagues parade around in haute couture and stiletto heels, Betty shows up for work in her mismatched outfits, complete with thick glasses and awkward braces. The series, which made its debut during the 2006-2007 season on ABC, could've relied on physical humor for laughs. But the sharp writing and likeable cast bring the show to life. There's a lot going on in the first year. Besides setting Betty up asModemagazine's ugly duckling overachiever, the first few episodes introduce viewers to a superb supporting cast that includes Betty's frenemies Amanda (Becki Newton) and Marc (Michael Urie), the hysterical duo that aligns themselves to whoever can best advance their careers. As for Betty's womanizing boss, Daniel (Eric Mabius), he's not the brightest bulb in the package. Recalling childhood outings with their mother, he says, \"She used to like taking us to clothing museums.\" To which his sibling says, \"Those were stores! She just called them museums to get us out of school.\" Salma Hayek--one of the show's producers--guest stars in an arc as a powerful editor who beds Daniel to prove a point. But it's her unexpected turn as an actress on Ignacio's favorite soap opera that is the real treat.About halfway through the 23-episode series, it appears that the writers switched gears with one of their main plots revolving around a possibly undead fashion editor. But in a typical over-the-topUgly Bettyway, they make the plot switch work. The heart of the show is when Betty returns home from work. She still lives with her father, Ignacio (Tony Plana), older sister Hilda (Ana Ortiz), and nephew Justin (Mark Indelicato). Justin is one of TV's best kid characters. Not only is he equally adorable and wise, but he is most probably--or will grow up to be--gay. The way his family accepts him for who he is--rather than who they wish he was--is incredibly loving and thoughtful. Betty also is navigating a love life that she makes more complicated than it has to be. Instead of dumping a boyfriend who cheated on her, she allows her sister to manipulate her into staying with him. When she finally realizes she has strong feelings for Henry (Christopher Gorham), the adorable accountant at work who has a huge crush on her, it may be too late. The season finale will leaves viewers with several cliffhangers revolving around Ignacio, Justin's father, and (of course) Betty. For most fans, season 2 can't come fast enough.--Jae-Ha KimMoreUgly BettyUgly Betty: The Complete First Season (Spanish Version)Ugly BettyWall CalendarStills fromUgly Betty(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0018CWEXA", "B001L1S1SK", "B003F3NDOE", "B00079FUI6", "B000FIMG4U", "B00K8HAKAK", "B0018CWF02", "B0077PTX0E", "B000P6YNTI", "B0077PTWX2", "B0077PTWH8", "B0018CWEYO", "B000R7HRRA", "B003F3NDP8", "B000FUTVPA", "B0077PTWHI", "B001VPJYZK", "B003R0MEXQ", "B001RHGRU2", "B003F3NE7K", "B0016OOM6W", "B0077PTWY6", "B00GOC74QG", "B0001O3YLM", "B00005JNOG", "B000FIMG68", "B003L77G56", "B00005JO9J", "B003F3NDW6", "B0037XPPAM", "B0018CWEVW", "B00HW3EWDO", "B0050MB5P2", "B000ERVJKE", "B0011UBDS6", "B001VPJZ0E", "B001VPJYZU", "B003L77H1Y", "B001B7CNZ6", "B001ILFUB4", "B000W6ZUUC", "B00BGQ2NIO", "B001BNFR6W", "B007K7IAGM", "B000RBA6CO", "B000NOKFGW", "B007MDB6RO", "B003R0MF6W", "B001MVWRNE", "B000FIMG5Y", "B003L77GAQ", "B00BNV9WEA", "B0007G89FK", "B001FB4VZ8", "B000QDLSR0", "B001GP5TMW", "B003Y5HWGI", "B00369ERC4", "B00GOC75YW", "B0051GOB2G", "B0000AKY3Q", "B0018CWEZI", "B000P6YNSE", "B00CPEK3OM", "B0006J28DW", "B00007IG1M", "B00005JNEQ", "B00I099K4U", "B000E3L7F0", "B0089XJXRQ", "B000Q6GUKW", "B00JF5G8WU", "B0056GLNQI", "1401322727", "B0006FFRBG", "B004UFEJVM", "B0044RFTA6", "B0001Z3I1C", "B00GOC74I4", "B00009Y3RW", "B00ECGIB6I", "B001ILFUAA", "B0001IN0T4", "B00FGG60XY", "B0006IUE16", "B002CLKP00", "B000GPIPTM", "B000YAA2SQ", "B001JAHPZ8", "B002QZDSW4", "B000TGURZ8", "B00HUQCA28", "B000FFJYE8", "B003QZSWRY", "B00BGQ2NDO", "B00540G3GG", "B00B04NIOU", "B009LDD4V4", "B001OQCVFG", "B009LDD5E0"], "bought_together": ["B0018CWEXA", "B001L1S1SK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003F3NDOE", "B0018CWEXA", "B001L1S1SK", "B00079FUI6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 27730}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 6.97, "brand": "Buena Vista", "asin": "B00005JPII", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51LHo-j8kfL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ugly Betty: Season 1"}
{"description": "This two-disc collector's edition ofPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chestis packed with over five hours of special features that delve into everything from creating the mythology-inspired Davy Jones and Kraken figures, to working and planning without a completed script, the incredible CGI techniques used in the film, the intense sword training sessions and stunt work, and the unpredictability of filming on location in the Caribbean. The audio commentary by writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio is an interesting and insightful look into the finished film, but perhaps even more revealing is the 25-minute \"Charting the Return\" preproduction diary in which everyone from producer Jerry Bruckheimer to associate director Peter Kohn and writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio give a sense of the enormity of the project of concurrently writing and filming two sequels toPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. The overwhelming logistics of planning and casting without a finished script, scouting and preparing remote locations, constructing a new Black Pearl, and functional props like the rolling water wheel, and cutting costs to stay within budget are nothing less than mind-boggling. In the hourlong \"According to Plan\" feature, director Gore Verbinski, producer Jerry Bruckheimer, and a host of others detail the enormity of the project, focusing on the stamina involved in a 200-day shooting schedule and the need for adaptability and flexibility in dealing with everything from behind schedule excavations to the logistics of shooting on moving water and even the natural fury of a full-blown hurricane.  Shorter featurettes \"Meet Davy Jones: Anatomy of a Legend\" and \"Creating the Kraken\" focus on the mythological creatures in the film and the awesome visual effects and advances in CGI technology that made them possible.  \"Mastering the Blade\" follows Orlando Bloom (Will Turner), Keira Knightley (Elizabeth Swann), and Jack Davenport (Norrington) through some intense sword-fighting training sessions and \"Fly on the Set: The Bone Cage\" offers a frightening look at what it was like to shoot the bone cage scene of the movie.  Other bonus features include bloopers, an interactive tour of Johnny Depp's special makeup effects and wardrobe details, a look at how the 1967 Disney Land Pirates of the Caribbean ride was recently \"re-imagineered\" to incorporate some of the characters and elements from the new movies, producer Jerry Bruckheimer's photo diary, and a glimpse of the glitzy June 24, 2006 red carpet premiere on Disney Land's main street.--Tami Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JM5E", "B005COPWZW", "B004A8ZWUQ", "B0013BM63O", "B00005JN5E", "B004M1A21K", "B004DTLK80", "B000VR0570", "B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY", "B00005JKCH", "B001HN694K", "B00005JPH2", "B00AEFYGBA", "B00BEZTMFY", "B001HQZJMU", "B00E5I2M6I", "B006VRRGNK", "B001BEK8HO", "B000E8M0VA", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B001E75QH0", "B008QE9XD2", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00LG6YEKE", "B00AEBBA72", "B007K3JFUQ", "B000HRMAPE", "B0090SI56Y", "B000E6EK2Y", "B0053FANRC", "B00005JMQW", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B00177YA1K", "B001TK80C0", "B000UR9T8C", "B00003CXI1", "B004EPYZUS", "B00003CXTA", "B001OQCV6A", "B0014Z4ON4", "B005G4TJUC", "B000F7CECK", "B00HFFE8HE", "B001GCUO1Q", "B0087ZG7J8", "B003YAR97K", "B008JFUNTG", "B001GCUO0W", "B000NIBURQ", "B0053FANPY", "B00023B1LC", "B003QO8TOQ", "B002VPE1BQ", "B00F84H73Q", "B003Y5H54W", "B00003CWT6", "B00007AJGH", "B00E5I2M9K", "B000W7F5SS", "B0049IHX2C", "B00000IRE6", "B001F7MSFM", "B000AYELVA", "B002ZG9904", "B000VWYJ86", "B00CFA222M", "B003UYUQZW", "B008UZ949K", "B0002KVUKM", "B000209KMW", "B000UVKGPI", "B0087ZG7HK", "B0000WN140", "B001EZE5BU", "B002PMV9FG", "B000HT386M", "B000NQRR1Q", "B00003CXZ1", "630529142X", "B0002ZDVEU", "B004A8ZWSS", "B00005JM5B", "B000BTITKS", "B00E5I2MEK", "B002HWRYJE", "B001GZ6QC4", "B000W796OM", "B00AQSN7HE", "B0046BI81W", "B001VLBDD0", "B0060FXDCG", "B0084IG8TM", "B005OCFGTO", "B000OLGCIE", "B008JFUS0U", "B00007AJG4", "B009JBWOU0", "B001B3LIOC"], "bought_together": ["B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JM5E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005COPWZW", "B00005JM5E", "B0071JADFU", "B00005JPFX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 72898}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 16.95, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JP0F", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GQE7TQ72L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "Critically hailed as an instant classic, Clint Eastwood'sLetters from Iwo Jimais a masterwork of uncommon humanity and a harrowing, unforgettable indictment of the horrors of war. In an unprecedented demonstration of worldly citizenship, Eastwood (from a spare, tightly focused screenplay by first-time screenwriter Iris Yamashita) has crafted a truly Japanese film, with Japanese dialogue (with subtitles) and filmed in a contemplative Japanese style, serving as both complement and counterpoint to Eastwood's previously released companion filmFlags of Our Fathers. Where the earlier film employed a complex non-linear structure and epic-scale production values to dramatize one of the bloodiest battles of World War II and its traumatic impact on American soldiers,Lettersreveals the battle of Iwo Jima from the tunnel- and cave-dwelling perspective of the Japanese, hopelessly outnumbered, deprived of reinforcements, and doomed to die in inevitable defeat. While maintaining many of the traditions of the conventional war drama, Eastwood extends his sympathetic touch to humanize \"the enemy,\" revealing the internal and external conflicts of soldiers and officers alike, forced by circumstance to sacrifice themselves or defend their honor against insurmountable odds. From the weary reluctance of a young recruit named Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya) to the dignified yet desperately anguished strategy of Japanese commander Tadamichi Kuribayashi (played by Oscar-nominatedThe Last Samuraicostar Ken Watanabe), whose letters home inspired the film's title and present-day framing device,Letters from Iwo Jima(which conveys the bleakness of battle through a near-total absence of color) steadfastly avoids the glorification of war while paying honorable tribute to ill-fated men who can only dream of the comforts of home.--Jeff ShannonOn the DVDsLike the film itself, the two-disc special edition ofLetters from Iwo Jimais predominantly Japanese in content, and that's as it should be. Disc 1 presents the film in a  flawless widescreen transfer, with a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround soundtrack that perfectly captures the film's wide dynamic range. The optional subtitles can be turned off for those wishing to immerse themselves in a completely Japanese viewing experience. Disc 2 opens with \"Red Sun, Black Sand: The Making ofLetters from Iwo Jima,\" a 20-minute behind-the-scenes documentary that concisely covers all aspects of production, from director Clint Eastwood's initial decision to create a companion piece toFlags of Our Fathers, to interview comments from principal cast and crew, the latter includingFlagsscreenwriters Paul Haggis andLettersscreenwriter Iris Yamashita, costume designer Deborah Hopper, editor Joel Cox, cinematographer Tom Stern, production designer James Murakami (taking over for the ailing Henry Bumstead), and coproducer Rob Lorenz. \"The Faces of Combat\" is an 18-minute featurette about selecting the Japanese (and Japanese-American) cast ofLetters, and how they were chosen through the international collaboration of Eastwood's long-time casting director Phyllis Huffman (who turned over some of her duties to her son while struggling with terminal illness) and Japanese casting associate Yumi Takada, who filled important roles with Japanese celebrities (like pop star Kazunari Ninomiya, who plays \"Saigo\") and unknown actors alike.\"Images from the Frontlines\" is a 3.5-minute montage of images from the film and behind-the-scenes, set to the sparse piano theme of Eastwood's original score. The remaining bonus features chronicle the world premiere ofLettersin Tokyo on November 15, 2006. The premiere itself is covered in a 16-minute featurette taped at the famous Budokan arena, where we see the red-carpet procession, a full-capacity audience despite cold November weather, and introductory comments from the film's primary cast and crew, many of them quite moving with regard to the satisfaction of working on a film that helps Japanese viewers come to terms with a painful chapter of their history. The following day's press conference (at the Grand Hyatt Tokyo hotel) is a 24-minute Q&A; session covering much of the same territory, with additional testimony from principal cast & crew. Throughout this two-day event, it's clear that Eastwood (referring to himself as \"a Japanese director who doesn't speak the Japanese language\") was warmly embraced by the Japanese, and thatLetters from Iwo Jimahad served its intended purpose, reminding us of the horrors of war while uniting both Japanese and Americans in somber reflection, 61 years after the battle of Iwo Jima.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000M4RG42", "B00005PJ8T", "B00001ZWUS", "B00AEBBA36", "B001IBIHQ4", "B0015D20FE", "B00005JK8K", "B004U7MQWY", "0767802470", "B00AEFXVCU", "B00006CXSS", "B00275EGWY", "B000NTPG7A", "B00AEFXRRO", "B000065U1N", "B00003CXTG", "0792839730", "0792841409", "B007S0DCUU", "B000FVQLRA", "079284646X", "B00005PJ8S", "B0009RCPUC", "B003ASLJO0", "B00AEBB86U", "B00AEFXGIY", "B000EHSVS2", "B000P0J09C", "B003ASLJOU", "B002T9H2LA", "B000EHSVSC", "B00B0U2SFE", "B000AQ69QI", "B002O3Z4WU", "B006OFN0SE", "B003AWRMCO", "B0000BWVCR", "B00AEFYBA6", "B002O3Z510", "B00008K76U", "B00AEFYENK", "B0007TKNLA", "B003ASLJQS", "B003ASLJPE", "B00003CXHJ", "B003ASLJQI", "B00003CXA6", "B0007TKNGA", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00096S4B2", "B008XJM7T2", "0782010040", "B00004XPPC", "B001TUZG4K", "B003AWRMCE", "B009XTF8NI", "B002GHHHPQ", "B00CZB9BE8", "B00004XPPG", "B00AEFXN9G", "B0002V7ON8", "B00AEFXVOI", "B000H5V8H2", "B003ASLJKE", "B005GYSV4M", "B00005N5S3", "B0041H55H6", "B0076XTIWU", "B003AWRMC4", "B00AEFY5B6", "0800177967", "B00009OOFA", "B003ASLJMW", "0792838408", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B006TTC5HC", "B004DY1VIO", "B000NQQ4OM", "B000E5N6KW", "B003AWRMCY", "B00AEFY0F2", "B003UESJHO", "B00DL48BM6", "B003XMKU16", "B00AZNEW5G", "B003ELKNH2", "B0007P0YKY", "B000095WW8", "B002CPMB9O", "B000ELL1R6", "B000A2WJBQ", "B002ID09BM", "B0051HCVEU", "B002ZG97RE", "B0006VL1J2", "B0001GF2GU", "0792841662", "0792843576", "6304765258", "B000MGTQ7U"], "bought_together": ["B000M4RG42", "B00001ZWUS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000M4RG42", "B000P1XITE", "B00AEBBA36", "B00001ZWUS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 20999}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.44, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JPKE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51iZss0%2BzhL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Letters from Iwo Jima (Two-Disc Special Edition)"}
{"description": "\"I bought a car. Turned out to be an alien robot. Who knew?\" deadpans Sam Witwicky, hero and human heart of Michael Bay's rollicking robot-smackdown fest,Transformers. Witwicky (the sweetly nerdy Shia LaBeouf, channeling a young John Cusack) is the perfect counterpoint to the nearly nonstop exhilarating action. The plot is simple: an alien civil war (the Autobots vs. the evil Decepticons) has spilled onto Earth, and young Sam is caught in the fray by his newly purchased souped-up Camaro. Which has a mind--and identity, as a noble-warrior robot named Bumblebee--of its own. The effects, especially the mind-blowing transformations of the robots into their earthly forms and back again, are stellar.Fans of the earlier film and TV series will be thrilled at this cutting-edge incarnation, but this version should please all fans of high-adrenaline action. Director Bay gleefully salts the movie with homages to pop-culture touchstones likeRaiders of the Lost Ark,King Kong, and the early technothrillerWarGames. The actors, though clearly all supporting those kickass robots, are uniformly on-target, including the dashing Josh Duhamel as a U.S. Army sergeant fighting an enemy he never anticipated; Jon Voight, as a tough yet sympathetic Secretary of Defense in over his head; and John Turturro, whose special agent manages to be confidently unctuous, even stripped to his undies. But the film belongs to Bumblebee, Optimus Prime, and the dastardly Megatron--and the wicked stunts they collide in all over the globe. Long live Transformers! --A.T. HurleyOn the DVDThe special edition ofTransformersis packed with extras (and more than a few product placements for Hasbro). The entire second disc is devoted to featurettes on aspects of making the technical tour-de-force--and the land mines involved in tinkering with a beloved '80s franchise. Executive producer Steven Spielberg is very much a part of the proceedings, from his introductory comments (\"I think everybody likes the idea of taking something you're familiar with and turning it into something you're not so familiar with--like an 18-wheeler become Optimus Prime\") to mentions of his films that influenced this one, likeE.T.andClose Encounters of the Third Kind.Director Michael Bay is brash and entertaining as he talks about his initial reluctance to take on the project, his indoctrination at \"Transformers U\" at Hasbro, and his enthusiasm for guerrilla-style action filmmaking. Star Shia LaBoeuf says, \"He is the sickest action director\" out there, and there's plenty of evidence here to support that. Other great highlights include features on how key scenes were shot, including the heart-pounding desert battle and the shootout in the streets of downtown L.A.--adrenaline-pumping stuff, even without the Transformers CGI'd in. --A.T.

{"description": "Alas! The fifthHarry Potterfilm has arrived. The time is long past that this can be considered a simple \"children's\" series--though children and adults alike will enjoy it immensely. Starting off from the dark and tragic ending of the fourth film,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenixbegins in a somber and angst-filled tone that carries through the entire 138 minutes (the shortest of anyHPmovie despite being adapted from the longest book). Hopes of winning the Quidditch Cup have been replaced by woes like government corruption, distorted media spin, and the casualties of war. As the themes have matured, so have the primary characters' acting abilities. Ron (Rupert Grint), Hermione (Emma Watson), and especially Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) are more convincing than ever--in roles that are more demanding.Harry is deeply traumatized from having witnessed Cedric Diggory's murder, but he will soon find that this was just another chapter in the continuing loss he will endure. Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) has returned and, in an attempt to conceal this catastrophe from the wizarding public, the Ministry of Magic has teamed up with the wizard newspaperThe Daily Prophetto smear young Potter and wise Dumbledore (Michael Gambon)--seemingly the only two people in the public eye who believe the Dark Lord has returned. With no one else to stand against the wicked Death Eaters, the Hogwarts headmaster is forced to revive his secret anti-Voldemort society, the Order of the Phoenix. This welcomes back characters like Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson), kind Remus Lupin (David Thewlis), fatherly Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), and insidious Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), and introduces a short list of intriguing new faces. In the meantime, a semi-psychotic bureaucrat from the Ministry (brilliantly portrayed by Imelda Staunton) has seized power at Hogwarts, and Harry is forced to form a secret society of his own--lest the other young wizards at his school be left ill-equipped to defend themselves in the looming war between good and evil. In addition, Harry is filled with an inexplicable rage that only his Godfather Sirius seems to be able to understand.This film, though not as frightening as its predecessor, earns its PG-13 rating mostly because of the ever-darkening tone.  As always, the loyal fans of J.K. Rowling's books will suffer huge cuts from the original plot and character developments, but make no mistake: this is agoodmovie.--Jordan ThompsonOn the DVDThe second disc ofThe Order of the Phoenixfeatures \"The Hidden Secrets of Harry Potter,\" a retrospective on the series so far, with \"Potter experts\" (i.e., people who run fan sites) weighing in on what's to come. This must have been filmed during production, because all their speculation about the conclusion of the saga is clearly dated and therefore superfluous (sinceOrderreleased theatrically at the same time as the seventh book, one would've expected a more current analysis). Many of the deleted scenes are mostly extensions, with the exception of one hilarious take of Professor Trelawney (Emma Thompson) trying--unsuccessfully--to eat gracefully during Dolores Umbridge's introduction at Hogwarts. The chatty actress Natalia Tena, who plays Tonks, gives a tour of the set in \"Trailing Tonks,\" even playing a Christmas song she wrote on her guitar, and director David Yates and editor Mark Day demonstrate editing 101 with a feature that lets you edit your own scene from the movie. Watch the feature but skip the self-editing part; the controls are too complicated to navigate and too frustrating to work properly (plus, hit the wrong button and you've gone all the way back to the beginning). A digital copy of the movie is also included on the bonus disc.--Ellen A.

If your idea of a good time is watching a mangy dog urinate into the vacant eye socket of a corpse, this is just the movie for you! In an attempt to create a new horror icon like Freddy Krueger or Jason Voorhees, former porno director Gregory Dark and less-than-stellar screenwriter Dan Madigan have dreamed up a routine plot that's hardly original, but deviously addictive to anyone who digs this kind of stuff: Eight troubled and not-very-bright teens, fresh out of a detention center, are given a second chance when they're taken to the decrepit, filthy Blackwell Hotel and told to clean the place up so it can be turned into a homeless shelter. What they don't know is that the hotel hides a secret, axe-wielding resident named Jacob Goodnight (played by WWE superstar Glen \"Kane\" Jacobs) who's got a knack for plucking the eyeballs from his hapless and ill-fated victims. He's basically an evil kid in the hulking body of a wrestler (call it type-casting, if you will), andSee No Evilis more sick than scary as Jacob does his handiwork, which includes the rather hilarious and grimly ironic dispatch of an animal rights activist, to name just one item in the movie's smorgasbord of splatter.

{"description": "The Dark Knightarrives with tremendous hype (best superhero movie ever? posthumous Oscar for Heath Ledger?), and incredibly, it lives up to all of it.  But calling it the best superhero movie ever seems like faint praise, since part of what makes the movie great--in addition to pitch-perfect casting, outstanding writing, and a compelling vision--is that it bypasses the normal fantasy element of the superhero genre and makes it all terrifyingly real.  Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is Gotham City's new district attorney, charged with cleaning up the crime rings that have paralyzed the city. He enters an uneasy alliance with the young police lieutenant, Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), and Batman (Christian Bale), the caped vigilante who seems to trust only Gordon--and whom only Gordon seems to trust. They make progress until a psychotic and deadly new player enters the game: the Joker (Heath Ledger), who offers the crime bosses a solution--kill the Batman. Further complicating matters is that Dent is now dating Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, after Katie Holmes turned down the chance to reprise her role), the longtime love of Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne.In his last completed role before his tragic death, Ledger is fantastic as the Joker, a volcanic, truly frightening force of evil. And he sets the tone of the movie: the world is a dark, dangerous place where there are no easy choices.  Eckhart and Oldman also shine, but as good as Bale is, his character turns out rather bland in comparison (not uncommon for heroes facing more colorful villains). Director-cowriter Christopher Nolan (Memento) follows his critically acclaimedBatman Beginswith an even better sequel that sets itself apart from notable superhero movies likeSpider-Man 2andIron Manbecause of its sheer emotional impact and striking sense of realism--there are no suspension-of-disbelief superpowers here. At 152 minutes, it's a shade too long, and it's much too intense for kids. But for most movie fans--and not just superhero fans--The Dark Knightis a film for the ages.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B000PC6A3E", "B002ZG981E", "B00G4RD4PQ", "B0039208QM", "B001GMALGY", "B00E2Y0YBK", "B00C2IGQBA", "B0039208JE", "B00H14WTLQ", "B0039208CG", "B0085D3I3K", "B0039208C6", "B000M5AJQI", "B00319ECGK", "B001FB55H6", "B00EIG5M5A", "7020070078", "B00E2Y6AUY", "B00D5FMGGS", "B001OQCV6K", "B0013FBS20", "B000Q6GX5Y", "B001GKJ2FC", "B00FPS79F6", "B001992NUQ", "B004JMSIRC", "B001RIY4WE", "B00DYEN6XC", "B008QZ5PY2", "B001F7MSG6", "B00FAHYNWE", "B00J7PRJXU", "B001AQT0Z4", "B001UV4XEW", "B0083SBJXS", "B00AEFY552", "B00C8RD79O", "B007KAJG3K", "B007L4HET8", "B004EPZ07U", "B007L4HFDI", "B00AEFXKOO", "B000PC0U1W", "B00C6B8TB8", "B00HINFI4K", "B003TT2X6I", "B001KZIRM2", "B002ZG99NG", "B00EZ4M68G", "B004SIP90G", "B003ZHR6RK", "B001GCUO16", "B003TT2X6S", "B00JNEWSLS", "B001F3FUK6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B002ZG981E", "B000PC6A3E"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPY0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pGxSkkz4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Dark Knight [Theatrical Release]"}

When beautiful but reclusive goth teenager Ginger (Katharine Isabelle) is attacked by a monstrous wolf on the eve of her first period, her body starts changing in a big way, as do her suddenly lusty, feral appetites. Director John Fawcett masterfully balances the expectations of teen horror exploitation (blood, bodies, sex, smart dialogue, and good old-fashioned monster-movie scares) with clever black humor and tender sisterly solidarity. Only devoted sister Brigitte (gloomy Emily Perkins) knows the truth, and even as Ginger's abrupt transformation threatens their once unbreakable friendship, bonds of blood and love keep them together: Brigitte disposes of Ginger's victims while searching for a cure. Mimi Rogers costars as their dotty but unexpectedly sensitive mom, ready to sacrifice all to protect her daughter.

But there are others who look at the series' glacial pace, loopy costumes and makeup, cheesy sets, primitive special effects, stilted dialogue, and self-serious tone and wonder what planet those rabid fans are from.Set 6 of the digitally remastered series, containing six episodes (numbers 31 to 36) on two discs, offers plenty of evidence to support both arguments. On the one hand, there are some intriguing ideas, weighty themes, and good writing here, as in \"New Adam, New Eve\" (episode 34), in which Koenig (Landau) and company confront the very existence of God himself, or \"The Rules of Luton\" (episode 31), in which Koenig and Maya (Catherine Schell) find themselves in deep trouble on a planet where plants are the dominant life form. But too often those virtues are hamstrung by poor execution, as in \"Luton,\" where our heroes must battle three absurd-looking and -acting aliens. Smart sensibility, silly look and feel: this is theSpace: 1999paradox. And the truth is that nowadays, when advanced film technology is making even the earlyStar Warsfilms look dated, many of these episodes seem positively quaint.DVD bonus features include a three-minute \"making of\" featurette (on the first disc), a gallery of production stills (on both discs), and interactive menus. Some material that was not seen in the original U.S. broadcasts has been restored.--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000067IVQ", "B00005UW77", "B000067IVR", "B00005KH49", "B00005KH48", "B0000524FE", "B0000524FF", "B00BUDDMGU", "B00B94VJYW", "B000U1ZV7G", "B002VA5A02", "B00004TJJV", "B0002MHDW4", "B00D9EJFZA", "B0000AZKJ8", "B000O78KWE", "B006TBYC76", "B00F3L8P26", "B0045HCJKS", "B000E6ESEY", "B002BAW6GI", "B002BAW6FY", "B002BAW6FE"], "bought_together": ["B00005KH49"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BUDDMGU", "B00005KH49", "B0000524FF", "B0000524FE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 153855}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 17.87, "brand": "LIONSGATE FILMS", "asin": "B00005UW78", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51W5T22K7DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Space 1999, Set 6"}

{"description": "A dazzling action movie from South Korea,Shirifollows two South Korean government agents, Ryu and Lee, as they pursue a female super-assassin from North Korea. Meanwhile, an elite paramilitary squad from North Korea has stolen a shipment of CTX, an undetectable liquid explosive of enormous power, which they've planted all over the city of Seoul. As their investigations are successively foiled, Ryu and Lee begin to suspect that there is a mole within the ranks of the agency--and it may be one of them. Both hyperstylish and hyperrealistic,Shiririps along as a smooth fusion of Hong Kong and American action movies. Ryu's troubled romance with his alcoholic fianc&#xE9;e adds a striking emotional counterpoint to the blazing gunfights and high-speed chases; the ending is unexpectedly moving. It's not surprising that this film beatTitanic's box-office records in Korea.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000U0X1Q", "B0006VL1J2", "B006C1S1DY", "B0009NZ78I", "B000GBEWNY", "B00AN5LCOA", "B00C6WHPO4", "B00A3TFMDI", "B003Y7F1IW", "B00FJX96BC", "B007S0DCUU", "B00H4IR3JC", "B0009S2T0M", "B004H2CXBQ", "B0013D8LD6", "B00006JDVZ", "B0002J4X20", "B00HSJ2EMI", "B005FQ1OOK", "B002P7UCJK", "B0009X75HO", "B008645YLM", "B008NNY9OY", "B007XIO8BY", "B0009VBTOG", "B00EI3XAZC", "B0009XRZQK", "B000GSYRY6", "B000FZEQDC", "B0076XTIWU", "B0076YFJGS", "B000E1EHPE", "0767851161", "B00HRYH52I", "B0019PL2W0", "B004P2VQZ2", "B0007Q6VXC", "B00HSJ2BEE", "B000A1OFZA", "B003P0TX8C", "B00AN5LD2Q", "B00HRYH6NQ", "B00FLD7CR0", "B0001GF2AQ", "B005T0OXWM", "B00HSJ2AMW", "B0001Z3ILM", "B000BGH2A4", "B000006A17", "B00CG0YLS4", "B007S0DB56", "B00008QS9I", "B005HWAOLQ", "B002XTBE6A", "B00005QFE5", "B008OTTRE4", "B0001611CO", "B00HNTOVX8", "B00HXEWGWQ", "B0013D8LBI", "B005M9VSLE", "B00AN5LCXQ", "B005NQSA4O", "B00008WJE2", "B008XEZXES", "B0018PH3NS", "B00005JN7C", "B000C65YNK", "B004XIWRW4", "B000EE3FUY", "B00GXFZOYI", "B0002S65KY", "B000R7HXZQ", "B0035JHYHA", "B006LOC01G", "B00FLCYIAA", "1607069628", "B001F0TM3A", "B0010X7432", "B000UDGOC0", "B003OXGW5M", "B0085A9J18", "B0013D8LCM", "B0099SI178", "B00005JKG1", "B00C6WHSRI", "B008XEZXA2", "B00ENTX7JU", "B004SEUJEG", "B000P6R9N0", "B003JDQJM8", "B00AN5LCRC", "B0006NKC0Y", "B000KX0IMC", "B001I82RVS", "B00B4MMVVY", "B00002CGGH", "B001SC5YP0", "B006L4MWVE"], "bought_together": ["B0000U0X1Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000U0X1Q", "B0006VL1J2", "B004H2CXBQ", "B006C1S1DY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 137530}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 41.95, "brand": "HAN,SUK-KYU", "asin": "B0000633R6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41H4CEVPBNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Shiri"}

{"description": "At the heart of the first years of Joss Whedon'sBuffy the Vampire Slayerwas the romance between Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar), slayer of all things evil, and hunky Angel (David Boreanaz), the tortured vampire destined to walk the earth with a soul. The second season ofBuffytook the Buffy-Angelpas de deuxfrom ecstasy to agony in a now-classic plot arc that catapulted the show from WB teen drama to true TV greatness. You see, if the cursed Angel ever experiences true happiness for a moment, he'll revert to being an evil vampire again. And guess what happens after Buffy and Angel finally declare their love for one another and consummate their relationship...Buffyfound its true momentum during the second season, as geeky Xander (Nicholas Brendon) fell in love with popular girl Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter), Willow (Alyson Hannigan) gave up her crush on Xander in favor of werewolf boy Oz (Seth Green), and watcher Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) began a sweetly tentative relationship with computer teacher (and witch) Jenny Calendar (Robia LaMorte). Mayhem came to Sunnydale, though, in the form of evil vampires Drusilla (Juliet Landau) and Spike (drolly wicked James Marsters), who were more than ready to aid and abet Angel as he turned bad. It all sounds like horror-action mayhem (and there are great fight scenes), butBuffytook on its plotlines with amazing depth, intelligence, and humor. And oh, man, the love story! Buffy and Angel's tragic relationship is one of the most heartbreaking you'll ever find. Buffy's final dilemma finds her having to save the world at Angel's expense, and Gellar (who deserves a passel of Emmys for her work) is phenomenal at telegraphing Buffy's swirling conflicts between love and duty. This is some of the best TV ever made, period.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EHSVKK", "B000EHSVLE", "B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVM8", "B000EHSVMS", "B000EHSVN2", "B000I0QLQY", "B000I0QLR8", "B000I0QLRS", "B000I0QLRI", "B000I0QLS2", "B003YF9Q08", "B0009W5J4Q", "B0006IUE16", "B000HD1482", "B000B5XOW0", "B007H9CNOI", "B00466H3CW", "B000ERVJM2", "B000CCBCGM", "B00344EAQO", "B005CM1IIE", "B000GG4Y6O", "1593078226", "B00006J3WH", "1595821651", "B006LG74Q0", "B000JLTRIG", "B00JF5G8WU", "B000OIOPHC", "B0000AQS0F", "B00133QNS6", "1442412097", "B000GG4Y28", "067103541X", "159307963X", "B00001R3O1", "B000BOH986", "B0024FAD8I", "B00133QNSG", "B002U8XW9Q", "0789326302", "B00AMDA2QC", "B00022FWEU", "B003L77GAQ", "B000FL7CAK", "B000QDLSR0", "B00005JLKB", "B00009MEJT", "B009LDCXNY", "1595826106", "B00BBXSPES", "B00006LPCK", "B005GP7ELM", "B000NOKFH6", "1595825584", "B000CNE0SS", "B000KLQUMG", "B0001JXPPC", "B000R9YLKY", "B003L77GWE", "B000BOH98G", "B000F8O2OM", "B0024FAR66", "B000EXDS3E", "B000EXDS3Y", "B000E5KQM8", "B000CNE0TC", "B00006FD9N", "B0017MO11O", "B000667HBS", "B000AJJNFE", "B0000CABIJ", "B00GNAO70K", "B002JVWR4U", "B009LDCWWG", "B00005V6BG", "B0092Q82LC", "B002U0KHME", "B00EIL7E9C", "B003R4ZMN6", "B00242KD1S", "B000LV6VYW", "B00018D42W", "B0048FUUAI", "B000095ZGW", "B00A8KJN8M", "B000V6LSNQ", "B00K0D9760", "B001ILFUA0", "B0024FAD9C", "1593078854", "B000FIMG4U", "B000EBGFPY", "B00079FUI6", "B000062XFG", "B00511N79O", "B0002KVUKM", "B00IKM5LXG", "B002GP7ZVY"], "bought_together": ["B000EHSVKK", "B000EHSVLE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EHSVKK", "B0046XG48O", "B000EHSVN2", "B000EHSVMS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 155101}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 38.99, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B000063IOT", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511DHF4ZPGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Second Season"}

Their careers in sorry decline, Jack Palance, Carol Lynley, Barry Morse (late of TV'sSpace: 1999), and John Ireland look embarrassed as they wrestle with a wearisome post-apocalyptic plot that pitches Morse, a pair of Ken-and-Barbie heroes, and their quirky robot (of course) against megalomaniac emperor Palance, who controls a drug needed for survival of moon-based colonists. Prior to directing this laughable mess, George McCowan had helmed episodes of several prominent TV action series of the '70s, but here he devolves into moribund hackwork.

The making-of featurette gives plenty of exposure and credit to the real-life S.W.A.T. officers who helped with the film, and a featurette on the original TV series is interesting, even though it's basically an advertisement for theDVD set.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004H2P6II", "B00005JLX2", "B0015LPRZQ", "B0025KVKDO", "B00005JLQN", "B0001XAQ9Q", "B00005JL3K", "B000J4QWMC", "B000A2X3MU", "B002ZG99N6", "B00275EGWY", "B000FJGR76", "B002AT8K9W", "B000KX0HFK", "B00AEBB86A", "B004LGGXG4", "B001MZ5W3M", "B000G5SILC", "B001BP4K22", "B00004Z1FX", "B000QUCRB4", "B000HC2M2K", "6304806434", "B00003CXNY", "B000TJBN80", "B000KLQUSU", "0790736411", "B00HLTD3ZW", "1558908315", "B000VG66XS", "B00016MSV2", "B002ZG994U", "B004V8W52S", "B008E70EES", "B000065U1N", "B000X1Z0C4", "B0000VJG72", "B00004Z4WR", "B0007W7I4W", "0767803434", "B0010YVCB6", "B00005JKTP", "B0034G4OUO", "B00005QW6V", "6304698747", "B000K7UBSO", "B000FFL2G6", "B000F8DV1M", "B004EPYZUS", "B000274T94", "B00004STUL", "B002VWNIEA", "B000095WW8", "B00000FZL2", "B00ECXJBN8", "B0000B1OFL", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00562I40K", "0792835727", "B0009KA7XG", "B000BTITKS", "B000KGGIZK", "B00009ZPUA", "B0002IQMAM", "B0058ZPNBI", "B005LAIIPS", "B001QB9H10", "B001O5LVVC", "B001UV4XGA", "B004HO6HWA", "B00BUC4TJ0", "B00BEIYHO2", "B004P3ENLA", "B0006GANOQ", "B0019EXZY4", "B00000G3PA", "B0013J55B6", "B002GHHHL0", "B00004STDN", "B0009DWL8W", "6304711891", "B0034G4ORC", "B003Y5H5FG", "B00BB67UNW", "B001ILHY1I", "B004EPYZQC", "B002AT8KA6", "0790732149", "B00260HH2G", "B000CQLZ8S", "B005LAIH2C", "B002ZG97RE", "B003M987QK", "B000A0GP0Y", "B000KX0HIW", "B00009L1TA", "B00005V9I6", "0783240295", "B000P0J0BK", "B0000542CK"], "bought_together": ["B004H2P6II"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00008YLVB", "B000M341QE", "B005CFBYW6", "B003Q6D2B4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 24979}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.98, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00008EYA5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BEAR8WT7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "S.W.A.T.

{"description": "From the Terraceis one of Paul Newman's lesser-known films, but it's a worthy showcase for the actor's developing screen persona. LikeButterfield 8, this is a slick, prestigious adaptation of a John O'Hara novel, about loose morals and forbidden love among the wealthy elite. Director Mark Robson lacks the mastery of melodrama that Douglas Sirk would've brought to this material, but he's still on target with O'Hara's tale of a prodigal son (Newman) who rejects his late father's steel mill in favor of big-business conquest, only to find his trophy wife (superbly played by Newman's off-screen wife, Joanne Woodward) straying into the arms of her former fianc&#xE9;, while he falls in love with a socialite (Ina Balin) with whom he's much more compatible. A well-tuned drama of marital discord and unchecked ambition,From the Terracewas sharply adapted by Ernest Lehman between the triumphs ofNorth by NorthwestandWest Side Story, and Newman's brooding performance gave him a solid boost to his iconic role in the 1961 classicThe Hustler.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008MTW2", "B0006FO8PC", "B000EBD9T4", "B000EBD9U8", "B000L917X4", "B000HWZ4D4", "B00441GYOM", "B00AEFY9GW", "B004SUDQ8G", "B0052YDMZE", "B007TYI7YQ", "B0052YHHFA", "B000063US3", "B000NQRR34", "B0000DJZ8Q", "B000JU8HBA", "B000KNL2DQ", "B001KP2J6W", "B0007US7FI", "B00005BCK0", "B000XT1P48", "B00003CXBZ", "B0007PALUM", "B000CCW2UC", "B000063US2", "B00003Q433", "B00BTYRB58", "B0000DZTLW", "B00074DY16", "B00004TX2E", "B000EXDSCA", "B001SV3LL0", "B0009NZ2OW", "B000035Z5G", "B00K6D1SAC", "B00005BH23", "B001HSNTKW", "B001LPWGGY", "078323211X", "B004XKVP7K", "B00004TWZH", "B00006FDAU", "B000JLTR9A", "B0009W5IMO", "B0002B15ZG", "B000KGGJ1I", "B0019UGYK0", "B004I1K05W", "B003M3A86I", "B009WHDEQO", "B0008ENIDE", "B00319ECCY", "B00005JKF6", "B001ILTUL0", "B003XMKMVE", "B00005LC4D", "0767827791", "B0052SO0ZG", "B00KIZYDCI", "B001GS7Z0I", "B000056H2H", "B00083FZFE", "B00BQ44ERE", "B00AATV07S", "B000UJCAL8", "B003O2H7MA", "0786706821", "B001KO1BCG", "B0045HCJ9E", "B00466JALY", "B003V4JU1W", "B001QYOSEI", "B0006B2AA6", "B0007PALVQ", "B000CCW2U2", "B00AEBB97S", "B000EU1Q1I", "B004I1K05M", "B000OFOJ30", "B00KIZY3XW", "B000UPMZ30", "B00008LDO9", "B003WH765U", "B000WTVZHQ", "B00K6D1S7A", "B0039R18WU", "B0045HCJHQ", "B007N31YH0", "B000W089XS", "B001QYVW0Q", "B0000AUHQA", "B0008ENIAC", "B00005AUKD", "B00AEFYBA6", "6300269280", "B00AEFY9YY", "B000L91FZE", "B000EHSVOG", "B00008CMRO", "B00006RCO2"], "bought_together": ["B00008MTW2", "B000EBD9T4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0006FO8PC", "B00008MTW2", "B000KNL2DQ", "B00441GYOM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 47184}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.36, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B00008MTW0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NBZPMJ9QL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "From the Terrace"}

He leads a challenging, constantly progressing series of poses, one flowing into the next, integrating breath, movement, tension, and relaxation. The poses include Sun Salutation, standing poses, forward bends, back bends, twists, and arm balances. The first poses are fairly easy, and with each repetition of the series, Yee adds on more difficult movements, extending the series without pausing. You're encouraged to do as much of the series that fits your level, up to the entire 65-minute workout if you're an experienced yoga practitioner. Although you can begin at any level, some familiarity with yoga is recommended. The Hawaiian setting is gorgeous and inspiring.

{"description": "A hugely popular 1974 weekly TV series that's been completely restored for this collector's edition,Little House on the Prairieis based on Laura Ingalls Wilder's bestselling books and follows the Ingalls family through the trials and tribulations of pioneer life in the 1870s. The series opens with the extremely poor family settling in Plum Creek, near the town of Walnut Grove, Minnesota, and follows them as they struggle to build a house, plow and plant their land, and become part of their small town's community. Ma (Karen Grassle) and Pa (Michael Landon) are good, honest folk with a healthy compassion for others. But it seems like every day brings a new trial for them and their children, Mary, Laura, and Carrie (Melissa Sue Anderson, Melissa Gilbert, and Sidney and Lindsay Greenbush). A freak hailstorm ruins an entire crop of wheat, their newly born son dies, a bout of the plague threatens the entire town of Walnut Grove, the family's barn catches fire, a devastating blizzard looms, but the family perseveres and they never lose their faith in God or their belief in the goodness of each other and the people around them. Despite the hardships of everyday pioneer life, Pa and his family find plenty of time to help others. They come to the aid of a local girl suffering the effects of one leg being shorter than the other, Ma fills in for an ailing schoolteacher and inspires a previously unreachable pupil, and Ma and Pa band together to protect a young boy from harm at the hands of his drunken father. This series paints a striking picture of the difficulties of American pioneer life and the courage and resilience of pioneer men, women, and children. It's also a powerful portrait of a close-knit, giving family and the life-affirming lessons they learn and share each day. Michael Landon deserves much of the credit for the show's success as he filled the triple role of star, producer, and writer. Favorite episodes in season one include \"Country Girls,\" in which Mary and Laura attend their first-ever day of school; \"The Award,\" when Mary's studiousness leads to a fire in the family barn; the two-hour \"The Lord Is My Shepherd\" episode about the birth and death of young Charles Jr. and its profound effect on Laura; and \"Survival,\" in which a Native American friend saves the Ingalls family in a blizzard.

Enthralled by the scenic majesty and heaving power of nature, an alluring dancer (Riefenstahl) seeks the man of her dreams in a small mountain village. There she encounters a reclusive climber (Louis Trenker) and a young skier (Ernst Peterson), who are each pursuing their own elusive ideals amid the intoxicating beauty and treacherous dangers of the Alps. Riefenstahl, who would later direct the controversial Triumph of the Will and Olympia, no doubt acquired her fascination with the Ubermensch while working on this lofty morality tale, and developed an eye for the striking compositions for which she would later become famous.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000HD1MW0", "B000ION53C", "B000FQJA2S", "B000B837WY", "B00319T63Y", "B00000INUB", "B009KDVHMS", "B005ARYF1S", "B000B837WE", "0375404007", "031209843X", "B0040QYROA", "B0037A4ILC", "B00005ASOT", "B00D9BNONW", "B00BZHPM0K", "B00004TJKJ", "B000JLIYRQ", "B000FS9FLW", "0691115192", "B002L9N6TA", "B007R830N2", "B0000E69GR", "B000FS9FLM", "B000094J79", "B004GFGUEK", "B001M9ELJE", "B000094J75", "B000EQHXIW", "B0018W2L0G", "B000BP3ATW", "B000H5U5IK"], "bought_together": ["B000HD1MW0", "B000ION53C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000HD1MW0", "B000NY1E94", "B000B837WY", "B00000INUB"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 174764}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.95, "brand": "Kino International", "asin": "B00009XN90", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512BRJDC95L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Holy Mountain"}
{"description": "One of Jim Henson's finest hours was theStorytellerseries that first aired on HBO in 1987. As with his other non-Muppet creations (Labyrinth), Henson fills the screen with wonderful creatures that have a wisp of a J.R.R. Tolkien fantasy. This collection of nine stories (it does not contain the Greek myths arc) were adapted by Anthony Minghella, who became an Oscar-winning filmmaker a decade later withThe English Patient. Minghella weaves the narration of the storyteller (played with aplomb by John Hurt) with dialogue from the stories to beguiling effect; the storyteller doesn't simply introduce the tales.A few of the stories have been available before on video, but this collection starts with the debut, the Emmy-winning \"Hans My Hedgehog,\" the title role being a young disformed man who helps a lost king in the woods. Other highlights include \"The Luck Child\" about a king bent on destroying a commoner boy, known as the luck child (\"the seventh son born of a seventh son on a week with two Fridays\"). After a wizard declares the boy will grow up to be king. The fate of the king is one of those hooks that should have the kids smiling for days. Henson himself directs \"Death and the Soldier,\" a brilliant example of how these episodes were so wonderfully complex. A penniless solider (Bob Peck) is given a magical sack and he uses it to full effect, capturing gremlins and greater evils on his way to be king. \"Sapsorrow\" is a curious variation on the Cinderella legend. \"A Story Short\" is the storyteller's own adventure. He makes a deal with a king to tell a story every day of the year. Yet on the last day, the storyteller's mind is a blank and his fate may lead him to a boiling vat of oil. Henson's work is true family entertainment and at only 22 minutes per episode, it's the perfect companion for some fine entertainment around the TV.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001AZIRV8", "B0002J4X2U", "B002CLKOYM", "B000BT97AO", "B00000JPH6", "B00000K3D4", "1936393980", "1936393247", "039458256X", "B0016BWACI", "B001DJLCPO", "B003DBLDIQ", "B00005JN8Q", "0810945797", "B001O5LVQ2", "B000JBXHOG", "B000BPL2GK", "B001JQHT26", "0345526112", "B002WJHDJI", "1936393093", "B0013527I4", "B005G1729K", "B00BCMT4B6", "0028620089", "B00ISZNB6O", "B002M3JJEG", "B002NZK5SW", "0767810864", "B007QD0VOE", "B000Q6774K", "B002LYD2LW", "B000N4SA8M", "0679412034", "B007HM3100", "B003RHZ6I4", "B0000640T0", "0439517885", "B0009ULBGS", "B0043YI5LA", "B00HZMZ2HM", "B00B04NIZO", "1606310593", "006219481X", "B00005JMH8", "B000NJMJGG", "B000B8I9XQ", "1574925628", "B006U49SC6", "B000E8NRVC", "B004B93RDS", "1465417486", "B0035Q638Y", "B0016BPWNM", "B0002PYS74", "B002LYD2LM", "B00EDUCO3O", "B004QSQMKE", "B002Z7FM68", "B006W4KVI4", "B003RACGZM", "B00004R99S", "140122427X", "B00003CXBK", "B003X2P976", "B00DNF1S0K", "B00CUDD0KW", "B00005JNU5", "B00B1CGEK6", "B002LII67S", "B001GD6VTE", "B008JFUN50"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001AZIRV8", "B00000JPH6", "B00000K3D4", "B0002J4X2U"]}, "price": 32.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 59761}, "asin": "B0000A2ZU6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514BM6RM78L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jim Henson's The Storyteller ~ The Complete Collection"}
{"description": "Lexx's third year had a predetermined 13 episode run, and in a new direction there's also a predetermined continual storyline. This is teasingly set-up by \"Fire and Water\"--the names of a binary planet system. TheLexxis stuck in orbit around 4,000 years after the \"End of the Universe.\" We're introduced to the mysterious Prince (Nigel Bennet) who rules the planet Fire, 790 experiences a shift of devotion, and Xev gets a new hairdo. All threads are expanded by \"May\" (Anna Kathrin Bleuler) who's found on planet Water. All too suddenly, Xev's in love with Prince and Stanley with May. The crew are torn every which way. Even more so when a fleet of new Moths land Kai in \"Gametown\", where the show's most gratuitous nudity yet reassures fans that this third year will be as dangerous and dirty as it's always been.Ralph (Withnail & I) Brown's character Duke suddenly comes to the fore in \"Boomtown.\" These towns teach us more and more about the lifestyles on the two planets, and since this one is essentially a nonstop orgy Stan decides Water is the planet for him! (If the nudity seemed gratuitous in \"Gametown\", that's nothing in comparison.) Ending on a shock appearance by Kai (no spoilers here), a balloon chase leads straight into \"Gondola.\" Lost among the schizophrenic denizens of \"K-Town,\" Stan and Xev are eventually found by the dead assassin whose biomechanical systems are malfunctioning. It takes a shock reappearance of season 2's Universe-destroying Mantrid to make sense of his groin-located repair mechanism. Subsequently split up, Kai suffers the red tape of petty bureaucracy in Hog Town while Stan and Xev descend 39,000 steps to the planet's \"Tunnels.\" Stan bumps into show writer Lex Gigeroff cameoing as insane surgeon Doctor Rainbow, and escape is determined by another death and resurrection from the enigmatic Prince.Stan has been endlessly teased by Xev. They got it together (in a manner of speaking) in \"Love Grows,\" but here at last they experience the \"ultimate in sexual satisfaction.\" Don't they? \"The Key\" metaphorically stands for a number of things in this ship-bound episode, which furthers the season's mystery considerably. And as if the sexual tension wasn't high enough already, the lifestyle offered Stan on the Water planet's \"Garden\" is all too tempting. The biggest lure is the return of beautiful plant gal Lyekka. Following straight on from that cliffhanger ending, \"Battle\" becomes a game of strategic cat and mouse aboard squadrons of hot air balloons. This season's budget helps return the look of the show to its stunning beginnings, and in this episode there are some of the best-conceived effects shots from the entire run. By now it's obvious that each community on the planet Fire is a thinly veiled satire on an aspect of modern society. A splendidly theatrical cameo from Ellen Dubin as Queen allows the viewer to question feminism, bureaucracy, and why the hell Giggerota has been reincarnated to taunt poor Stan.At last all questions are answered in what might as well be a two-part finale. \"The Beach\" would for any other series be considered the clips show: on an idyllic yet purgatorial stretch of sand, Stan is forced to account for his life by viewing events of the past. Judged by his harshest critic--himself--he then suffers all that Prince has promised and more as the true meaning of \"Heaven and Hell\" is revealed. Creator Paul Donovan clearly maintained a strong hand in every aspect of this season, but in directing his own work with these last two episodes we witness a genuinely rare example of personal vision. The narrative has been consistently surprising, but the twist left for last is literally breathtaking. TV sci-fi has never been so sexy and intelligent at the same time.--Paul Tonks", "related": {"also_bought": ["B008R52LA2", "B007AFC0W4", "B001DF681G", "B006LPHY5C", "B0009JE6FM", "B000JLTRHW", "B00F3L8P26", "B0006FO9B0", "B003H9LIU2", "B00404ME2E", "B000ELL1QC", "B001RHGRTS", "B0009JE6G6", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B00061QJSK", "B004XM38CS", "B00E688720", "B00E688AZE", "B000FJH5MC", "B000BCCAEQ", "B0009JE6FC", "B002QU1Z1K", "B0012IX35S", "B0011FLGZQ", "B002GP7ZVY", "B004EXWGHY", "B002GP7ZVO", "B001DW2BG0", "B002GP7ZW8", "B00HUPC5X8", "B002BAW6FY", "B005X4P3DC", "B001IO5C5K", "B0012IX34Y", "B000WTZ6SK", "B00KB614HQ", "B002BAW6GS", "B00E3QJ7JC", "B005GYXO30", "B000CEXFYW", "B000E5N6B6", "B000PHX8RA", "B0051GOB2G", "B002BAW6H2", "B000EDWLMS", "B003PGNBO8", "B000083C4A", "B00007L4O6", "B0081QF6Q8", "B00022FWEU", "B00GTZWZH6", "B002BAW6FE", "B002BAW6GI", "B000AQ69UE", "B004P3HA8I", "B002ZCY872", "B002GP7ZV4", "B00G5UR0SO", "B0037AGB9O", "B000F7CMPE", "B000056PGR", "B000FJH5M2", "B003Y7JWZ0", "B00018D4MM", "B002BWP2IK", "B005CFC04W", "B000BOH8Y6", "B00JK47BHM", "B00466H3A4", "B00170LCWC", "B003L77GWE", "B002USF1UO", "B000BR9SA0", "B000SMNL92", "B006MFQ4OS", "B0056GLNQI", "B00C6F61IW", "B002VA5A02", "B004EXWGJW", "B000FOPPBA", "B00DYQ1GBE", "B00IWTVDUW", "B000053VBW", "B00GX7D5G0", "B0042YZFYG", "B001F7MSH0", "B00B4804LM", "B0049H6RWK", "B002DUJ9Q6", "B00005M0JM", "B0048FUUAI", "B004HYW84G", "B004TJ1H3C", "B0000694VG", "B00005RIWW", "B00005M0JK", "B00IO998U2", "B00A3717C0", "B001CY5N00", "B00CQAQF1A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0006FO9B0", "B008R52LA2", "B00E688AZE", "B00F3L8P26"]}, "price": 0.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 332944}, "asin": "B0000AGWKE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511HGY5G5KL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lexx - The Complete Third Series"}

{"description": "Another cracked animated series from the Cartoon Network's \"Adult Swim\" programming block,Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Volume One's blend of superhero action and skewed humor should provide plenty of nourishment to fans of offbeat animation. The Aqua Teen Hunger Force are a squabbling trio of fast-food items (milkshake, fries, and a ball of hamburger meat) that have joined together to fight a host of monsters, aliens, and mad scientists in their native New Jersey.  Fans of traditional cartoons may find the surreal plotlines and low-fi animation unmanageable, but viewers who enjoy other Adult Swim programming likeSpace Ghost Coast to Coast(series creators Chris Willis and Matt Maiellaro are veterans from that show) will find the Force's adventures side-splitting. The two-disc set, which features 16 episodes from the series' first two seasons, is supplemented by commentary by Willis and Maiellaro on three episodes, including an early version of \"Rabbot.\" Disc 2 has a pair of Easter eggs that feature deleted scenes.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001MZ7KA", "B0002WZRSG", "B000B5XOR0", "B000VWX6SA", "B001EOQVA4", "B00330WP6Q", "B00005JPP2", "B0056EBHEI", "B0001MZ7K0", "B000S76LKI", "B0000AQS89", "B00069L0Z4", "B0007CILMA", "B002VWNIDQ", "B000E0OE3K", "B00097DY2U", "B000RPD0DC", "B000GIXLWA", "B0069R250G", "B000FO0AG0", "B000P2A6CA", "B001P7YD7S", "B000PAAJZG", "B0002WZRTU", "B00069L0YU", "B003BV8I9K", "B0007CILMK", "B004QLX0TM", "B000E6ES9O", "B000ABKHZC", "B000EMGIDC", "B001DZOD7C", "B00C6QT4CQ", "B001BGS17G", "B000KWZ1PC", "B001G7Q640", "B00023P49C", "B00116GEKW", "B000M7XRC4", "B000NNK4DM", "B003W5TO70", "B002N1AEWS", "B0012KSUTA", "B00023P49M", "B000AQ68Z0", "B0000CABL2", "B001NOMO2Y", "B0081QCZGC", "B00JSR5BJ6", "B008KHJJ9I", "B005CHTXWC", "B003NF97NU", "B0001ZWLVU", "B000ARXF7I", "B0017RFXJI", "B001RIZ7OI", "B00BYNL8DU", "B000FO0AFQ", "B000B5XOWU", "B0002YCVY2", "B000RO6JZO", "B001J4E1C4", "B00008YGRS", "B004L9GLM2", "B00008YGRV", "B000ERVJNG", "B00K8HAJN8", "B00GSSD73K", "B00113YHXG", "B0012018OE", "B000083C6V", "B000CNESM6", "B002JVWQYG", "B007ZFR67I", "B002GSXKRO", "B000RZPVYS", "B00267N3EU", "B008412UKA", "B000RW3VDE", "B003CN5B7E", "B005BUA1JE", "B0006Z2L2Y", "B003VVBZ7W", "B000USUA8E", "B00CO8WWS4", "B000R7I3XC", "B0002NY8XA", "B00158K0V0", "B000KLQUMQ", "B000F8O2QK", "B008412UQ4", "B000M341RS", "B003L77G7Y", "B00466HOR6", "B001O0TWXG", "B00BI5YEWG", "B000GETU2E", "B00466HORQ", "B00HDU9UOW"], "bought_together": ["B0001MZ7KA", "B0002WZRSG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000B5XOR0", "B0002WZRSG", "B00005JPP2", "B0001MZ7KA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 25003}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.59, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0000AQS81", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514M9DDJCXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Aqua Teen Hunger Force - Volume One"}
{"description": "The fifth season of Joss Whedon's hit series started out in excellent form as slayer extraordinaire Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) did battle with the most famous of vampires (that Dracula guy) and then went on to spar with another nemesis, little sister Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg). Wait--Buffy has a teenage sister? Where hasshebeen the past four years? And why is everyone acting like she's always been around? Turns out that young Dawn is actually \"The Key,\" a form of pure energy that, true to its name, helps open the gates between different dimensions. To protect said key from falling into the wrong hands, a group of monks gave it human form and sent it to the fiercely protective Buffy for safekeeping, creating new memories of Dawn for everyone as if she'd existed... well, always. Why all the super secrecy? There's this very, very,verybad girl named Glory (Clare Kramer) who wants the keyverybadly, and will do anything to get it. Oh, and by the way, Glory isn't just a run-of-the-mill demon... she'swayworse.Some fans will tell you thatBuffy\"jumped the shark\" with the introduction of Dawn, when in actuality this season was the pinnacle of the show's achievement, as there was superb comedy to be had (\"Buffy Vs. Dracula,\" the double-Xander episode \"The Replacement,\" the introduction of the \"Buffybot\" in \"Intervention\") as well as some of television's best drama. The Whedon-scripted and -directed \"The Body\" remains one ofBuffy's best episodes, when the young woman who faces down supernatural death on a daily basis finds herself powerless in the wake of her mother's sudden passing. The first third or so of the season was a bit choppy, but once the evil Glory came into her own,Buffywas a television force to be reckoned with. Kramer was the show's best villain (after the evil Angel, natch), and the supporting cast was never better. But as always, it was the superb Gellar who was the powerful center of the show, sparking opposite lovelorn vampire Spike (James Marsters) and wrestling with moral dilemmas rarely seen on television. With this season, Buffy Summers became, like Tony Soprano, one of television's true greats.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EHSVMS", "B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVN2", "B000EHSVLE", "B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVKK", "B000I0QLR8", "B000I0QLQY", "B000I0QLS2", "B000I0QLRS", "B000I0QLRI", "B007H9CNOI", "B000HD1482", "B003YF9Q08", "B0006IUE16", "B0009W5J4Q", "B000CCBCGM", "B000B5XOW0", "B000GG4Y6O", "B000ERVJM2", "B000JLTRIG", "B00344EAQO", "B00466H3CW", "1593078226", "B006LG74Q0", "B002JVWR4U", "B00001R3O1", "B000O77SN6", "B00006J3WH", "B0024FAR66", "B0000AQS0F", "B000X5SPBI", "B00AMDA2QC", "1595821651", "1595826106", "B001FB4W0C", "B000O77SMW", "B001AQO43M", "B000EWBNMS", "B0002XVKMM", "B000OIOPHC", "B002JVWRAO", "B000AQN894", "B005CM1IIE", "B000SQFC1S", "B002U8XW9Q", "1595825584", "B00133QNSG", "B003L77GAQ", "B00005JLKB", "B000R7GKQE", "B00JF5G8WU", "B009LDCXNY", "B000P0I4P8", "B004YM6JI2", "B0030Y12AA", "B001MVWRMU", "B009LDCWWG", "B0017MO11O", "B000FP2OPY", "B000AJJNI6", "B000EBGFPY", "0789326302", "B009LDD5XQ", "B0000CABIJ", "B00009MEJT", "B000N6TYLW", "B000QDLSR0", "B009GNI3HY", "B00133QNS6", "B00005JM67", "B009LDD4V4", "B000W089VU", "B00133QNRW", "B0002Y0QV2", "B000CNE0SS", "160010343X", "B00EIL7E9C", "B000F8O2P6", "B00092A1J4", "B000AO9BSS", "B002N5N5MK", "B000GPIPTM", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B001AI774S", "B00BBXSPES", "B003R4ZMN6", "B00005JNOG", "B004X60QWO", "B00511N79O", "B003L77GGK", "B00AMDA2P8", "B001JAHRME", "1442412097", "B004FM2EQC", "B002JVWR4A", "B00006LPCK", "B0010YSD7M", "B0024FAD9C", "B000BOH98G"], "bought_together": ["B000EHSVMS", "B000EHSVLY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVKK", "B000EHSVMS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 130266}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 29.59, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B0000AQS18", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51UKk69E9GL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Fifth Season"}
{"description": "UFOwas Gerry Anderson's first live-action TV series after a decade of producing such children's animated classics asStingray(1963) andThunderbirds(1964). The premise ofUFO, which ran for a single season of 26 episodes in 1970, was like a more serious version of Anderson'sCaptain Scarlet(1967): in the near future of 1980, a high-tech secret organization, SHADO, waged covert war against mysterious alien attackers. Ed Bishop played the American head of SHADO--he had been previously featured inCaptain Scarletand Anderson'sDoppelganger(1969)--though in all other respects this was a thoroughly British production. As with all Anderson series,UFOevidenced remarkable technological inventiveness and groundbreaking production values, coupled with startling lapses in fundamental logic too numerous to list.Much more adult in story and content than earlier Anderson productions, and surprisingly dark with its pragmatic view of human nature and downbeat endings, the show now seems like a forerunner ofThe X-Filesand the equally short-livedDark Skies(1996). Barry Gray's memorable theme and atmospheric music greatly enhanced the overall impact. Stylishly made, though terribly sexist by current standards and featuring eye-catching costumes more fitted for a campy dress party than the front line of a futuristic war, this cult classic eventually evolved intoSpace: 1999(1975).TheUFODVDs have been beautifully designed and produced. The mono sound is exceptionally strong, and the restored and remastered picture is almost unbelievably good for a 1970 TV show. With barely a flaw anywhere, the episodes look so clear, colorful, and detailed that they could have been filmed last week. This eight-disc megaset features all 26 episodes.--Gary S.

{"description": "A northern Spanish coastal town suffers from its own isolationism as shipyards close down, leaving the labor force scouring the streets for temp jobs with only their stubborn pride to show for it. Among the disillusioned is Santa (Javier Bardem), a cocksure, angry rebel who refuses to admit his own failures. Santa is the ring leader of a group of rapidly aging friends whose unemployed status causes them mounting grief. They drown their sorrows in an otherwise empty bar owned by Rico (Joaquin Climent), one of their coworkers from what now seems another life. While Santa tries to clumsily seduce women and pay for a lamp post he vandalized in anger, his companions battle serious alcoholism, loan denials, and marriage troubles, as they all face their own insignificance.Javier Bardem perfectly embodies the defiant loser that is Santa. Letting himself go and carrying a hefty gut, Bardem manages to exude the false charm of a bitter sad sack who has remained a lady's man. Captured in gritty detail, director Fernando Leon de Aranoa offers a shattered image of the proud work force of northern Spain in a picture that won five Goya Awards, Spain's equivalent to the Oscars.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0011FLH14", "B00003CXRG", "B00080Z53O", "B00116GEJ8", "B0041KKYF6", "B0000AGQ5V", "B00005JNCZ", "B001DJ7PR8", "B004MOJW0E", "B000088UZ4", "B00005N8A9", "B00HOGBXS6", "B002VECLXC", "B000LXHFMW", "B0002TT0MI", "B00005JLQW", "B008S2NABI", "B00FRILRW0", "B00005JL57", "B002M2T1V8", "B0000C9JFO", "B0041KKYFG", "B000Y54UUC", "B000N3T0DW", "B00HRJVHEK", "B001S400C0", "B002BWP3UC", "B0042816YK", "B001OXLGJQ", "B009GIGY3E", "B004XVMCMG", "B006C1S1DY", "B00006G8G3", "B00H9HZITU", "B00AZMFKXK", "B0036TGSJE", "B0019K4YT8", "B00FXWAZX2", "B002M2T1VI", "B00005421W", "B006HAJAGM", "B000O76ZQC", "6305132917", "B0007OCG5G", "B00005LZOD", "B00000F7E6", "B00009MEJ6", "B00023P4N8", "B002AK7SB2", "B000Q7ZLRY", "B000E1YVZK", "B00ATK02FO", "B0006GANN2", "B000083C5F", "B008LC8V1Y", "B0019UGYAU", "B000OVLBGC", "B008220DGE", "B00005AAF5", "B0041KXT26", "B00195FUFA", "B000N2HDH8"], "bought_together": ["B0011FLH14"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CXRG", "B0000AGQ5V", "B0011FLH14", "B00116GEJ8"]}, "price": 9.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 335212}, "asin": "B0000CBXZ3", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511PG5GYMBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mondays in the Sun"}

{"description": "Even under the heavy censorship of 1946 Hollywood, Lana Turner and John Garfield's libidinous desires burn up the screen in Tay Garnett's adaptation of James M. Cain's torrid crime melodrama. Platinum blond Turner is Cora, a restless sexpot stuck in a roadside diner married to mundane middle-aged fry cook Nick Smith (Cecil Kellaway) when handsome drifter Frank (Garfield) blows her way. It's lust at first sight, a rapacious desire that neither can break off, and before long they're plotting his demise--but in the wicked world of Cain nothing is that easy. Garnett's visual approach is subdued compared to the more expressionistic film noir of the period, but he's at no loss when he films the luminous Turner in her milky-white wardrobe. She radiates repressed sexuality and uncontrollable passion while Garfield's smart-talking loner Frank mixes street-smart swagger and scrappy toughness with vulnerability and sincere intensity. Costar Hume Cronyn cuts a cold, calculating figure as their conniving lawyer, a chilly character that only increases our feelings for the murderous couple, victims of an all consumingamour fouthat drives their passions to extremes.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001KXZGNW", "B001KXZGOG", "B002GSXKPQ", "B0087ZG7OI", "B002GSXKQA", "B007FQXEVY", "B001KXZGO6", "079073219X", "B003UN2IAY", "B008D1Q1VU", "B008D1R52Y", "B005F265CU", "B005EVY8MQ", "B007FQXEQO", "B008D1R52E", "B00004XPPK", "B000FFJYAW", "B002VWNIAY", "B001D8W7EK", "B003UN2I4K", "B0047BXQZY", "B0045HCJ9E", "B0008ENIAC", "B0049985XW", "B00871C09S", "B004H83IFU", "B00406UJZG", "B00AEBB97S", "B006H37PXY", "B0080JG2GE", "B00023P4GA", "B00AEFXD1O", "B000BQ5IXW", "B00AEBBA7W", "B0001HAGTW", "B008D1Q1TM", "B000FFJYAC", "B000244EYW", "B00007ELD1", "B0045HCJHG", "B001D8W7EU", "B00AEBB89C", "B00AEFXRWO", "B004UOHNCA", "B00005A0QS", "B00DNQM7N6", "B00023P4II", "B000CC1TNI", "B000FFJYAM", "B002945DUW", "B000ECX0O2", "B0087ZG7R0", "B005H8G78O", "B003B3V0RA", "B000087F79", "B0086IMNRQ", "B001PO54V0", "B004XKVP7K", "B000244EWO", "B000B8384Q", "B0024FAG80", "B00006RCO1", "B000025RE7", "B006H37P2K", "B0007ZEO8C", "B00466JALY", "B000FFJYA2", "B00004W229", "B00DBE97S8", "B0050FXDDQ", "B00005RDRL", "B00027JYLM", "B00AMSQBNK", "B008BSM1XC", "B00008LDNZ", "B000CNE088", "B004UOHNAC", "B0006HBV3C", "B00553K8DQ", "B00005JKF6", "B00AEFXN9G", "B0008ENID4", "B00023P4FQ", "B0035Q636Q", "B000PKG7CU", "B0000549B0", "B00003CXBU", "B0047BXR1C", "B00012L786", "B006FE83UE", "B00006RCO2", "B00BQ412GU", "B001PO550A", "B000244F2S", "B000EXDSBQ", "B000PMFRVU", "B00AATGDW0", "B0006HBV28", "B003ZEQMH8", "B0006Z2NE0"], "bought_together": ["B001KXZGNW", "B001KXZGOG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001KXZGNW", "B003ZEQMH8", "B008D1Q1VU", "B005F265CU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 36043}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0000EYUCU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CHTNvd9UL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Postman Always Rings Twice"}

In the wake of territorial murder, free-grazing cowboys Boss (Robert Duvall) and Charley (Costner) seek vengeful justice against the ruthless rancher (Michael Gambon) who threatens their law-abiding survival. A feisty ally (the late Michael Jeter, in his next-to-final film role) and a doctor's sister (Annette Bening) offer support during climactic shootouts, masterfully staged with the shock and suddenness of real-life gunfire.

{"description": "A disappointment after the superb two previous seasons, the final run ofBabylon 5found Claudia Christian departed and Ivanova replaced by Captain Elizabeth Lochley (Tracy Scoggins), who in a soap-opera twist turned out to be Sheridan's first wife. Sheridan was promoted to President of the Interstellar Alliance and the action moved to a group of telepaths seeking sanctuary from the PSI-Corp onB5. Giving a prominent role to Patricia Tallman's Lyta Alexander, a love story for her was woven with the leader of the telepaths, Byron (Robin Atkin Downs). Meanwhile the aftermath of the Shadow War was explored as the origin of human telepaths became clear in \"Secrets of the Soul,\" and the appearance of PSI-Corp's Bester (Walter Koenig) brought the plight of the refugees to a powerful close in \"A Tragedy of Telepaths\" and \"Phoenix Rising.\"This was immediately followed by a rare episode not written by J. Michael Straczynski. Much was expected of \"Day of the Dead,\" penned by Neil Gaiman, the British creator of DC's landmarkSandmancomic and graphic novel series. Yet despite a change of tone including a guest appearance by Penn & Teller as 23rd-century comedy favorites Rebo & Zooty, the story proved an incongruous side trip into an unexplained twilight zone of fantasy. As usual the season picked up toward the end, with a string of fine political episodes leading to \"The Fall of Centauri Prime\" and the haunting \"Objects at Rest,\" in which Sheridan and Delenn leaveBabylon 5for new quarters on Minbar.The final episode, \"Sleeping in Light,\" was directed by J. Michael Straczynski and made an epilogue to the series. Set 20 years later, after all the sound and fury this quiet, elegiac tale is the apotheosis of the love story that proved the balance to the tragedy of the preceding darkness.

{"description": "Two pretty high school girls (one a cheerleader!) don't like their mother or her new boyfriend (\"Daddy would have gotten us Uzis!\"). One morning, they wake up to find that everybody in Los Angeles has been turned to dust by a Comet except them, a guy who looks like Erik Estrada, some zombies and the occupants of a secret underground government installation. Written by Mark Logan Two girls from the Valley wake up to find that a passing comet has eradicated their world and left behind a mysterious red-dust and a pack of cannibal mutants. With the help of a friendly truck driver, the girls save the earth from a villainous \"think tank,\" karate chop their way through flesh-eating zombies, and, of course, find time to go to the mall. Written by Jaime Kidwell\n\nTwo sisters, high school seniors in the early 1980s, awaken one morning to blood red skies and the realization that the human race has been wiped out. It becomes apparent that anyone who was not surrounded by steel when the Earth recently passed through the tail of Haley's comet has been reduced to a pile of red ash (the trace elements of human chemical makeup.) They encounter a rebellious Native American man and take over the air waves at a local radio station in an attempt to get help. Unfortunately, they attract the attention of a group of scientists who knew what the effects of the comet would be. They hid underground in a steel laboratory, but idiotically left the vents open. Now, as various survivors of the comet who were only partially surrounded by steel are decaying into flesh-hungry zombies, the scientists are attempting to come up with a vaccine made of the blood of people who were not infected by the comet. Thus the trio must fight their way past not only roving packs of the cannibalistic dead, but also outsmart a pack of scientists desperate not to become that way themselves.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003JIPN20", "B003PIUINI", "6300182355", "0792845684"], "also_viewed": ["B002KPUN0K"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 232523}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.95, "brand": "", "asin": "B0001GV4PI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41101R6Z2KL.jpg", "title": "Night of the Comet"}

Vignettes on flying, casting, computer effects, characters, or simple behind-the-scenes footage are just some of various segments contained in five \"worlds.\" Be sure to \"Visit the Darling House\" to find a deleted scene and an alternate ending (which has the original book's ending of Pan returning). \"Board the Pirate Ship\" to see Jason Isaacs's (Capt. Hook) cute \"home movies\" from the set and a cut pirate song. The longest segment (12 minutes) is a puffy promotional piece hosted by Sarah Ferguson that goes over everything lightly, including the history of the tale. Note: this film would be a perfect candidate to have both a pan-and-scan and widescreen presentation on the same disc. The widescreen 2.40:1 ratio is pretty extreme for those who don't like seeing black bars on their set, but the film is so gorgeous you'll miss a lot on the full-screen edition.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B006JN87WK", "0767836324", "B004SIP7PS", "B00CTQWJEI", "B00CQRN3QI", "B000VKL6RK", "B003RHZ6IE", "B001HN694K", "0147508657", "B00011D190", "1495266699", "B00B4FZ8U2", "B00005JM9Q", "B00005JN2B", "B00736PCDO", "6305428042", "B000GB775E", "B00001YXE2", "B0011U52E2", "B00AEBB8KQ", "B00CTQWJPW", "B00139W3NE", "B0009XRZS8", "B000E8M0VA", "B00C1LIYZY", "B00005JPH2", "B004IMPRLS", "1407599461", "1468149822", "B000WE79MQ", "B00005JM7T", "B00H5RYIBI", "B000056T4I", "B00J0TSY1E", "B000OYCM5I", "B00009XUM5", "B0000524D0", "B002GOAH10", "B006X08DZ0", "1423160290", "B00E5RYCGM", "0736402381", "B0000VCZKM", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B00CTNYLQA", "B002GIBVV6", "B000077VR3", "0141329815", "B0006J28MI", "B000BB1MI2", "B005F96UJ6", "B000C3L27U", "B003Y5H52O", "B00A0MJA1I", "B000065V42", "B001CTDH4Y", "B0007LXPBI", "B001GCUO7A", "B000GW8U1I", "0783226810", "B000053VAZ", "B0013ND30M", "B00C888MJ8", "B000QQLVPQ", "6304711867", "B000065V44", "B002GJTYIW", "6305870179", "B004SIP75S", "B0087F7VSY", "B003ZHVJGO", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B0058YPL66", "B000324Y98", "B003NHRIVQ", "B00G5G7EXY", "B005LAIHSG", "B00009YXAW", "B000AAF1U4", "B006VRRGNK", "B000Q66FB6", "B005COPWZW", "B001NPD9JA", "B005IA9JZO", "B001R3YRIU", "B002GOAH1A", "B00AEFY9RG", "B005LAII0I", "B003L4Y5BW", "B008YWY0HK", "B002VPE1BQ", "B00005JLR2", "B001O5LVPI", "B0007KTBIU", "0767851013", "1558908404", "B002ZG99CC"], "bought_together": ["0767836324"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00CQRN3QI", "0767836324", "B00CTQWJEI", "B004SIP7PS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6592}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.89, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B0001HAISG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ANKSAE62L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Peter Pan (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "With this third season,Frasierscored an impressive hat trick, winning its third successive Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series. You don't need too much analysis to get to the bottom of this unprecedented success. The series was a primetime oasis of wit and sophistication, with welcome forays into farce that pricked Frasier's bubble of pomposity. His priceless reactions to the assaults on his dignity are worthy of Jack Benny. Frasier (Kelsey Grammer) can be infuriating, as in \"The Focus Group,\" in which he is obsessed with knowing why a lone focus group participant (guest star Tony Shalhoub) doesn't like him. But he is also endearing in his delusional view of himself as, in the words of one mocking bystander, a \"man of the people.\" Frasier meets his match in new station owner Kate Costas (Oscar-winner Mercedes Ruehl). Their combative relationship turns to lust over the course of the first 10 episodes.But the season's most pivotal story arc is the separation of  Niles (David Hyde Pierce) and Maris. \"Moon Dance,\" which marked Grammer's directorial debut, is a series benchmark, as a crestfallen Niles tangos with his unrequited love, Daphne (Jane Leeves), at a high society ball. Not that the Crane family still doesn't have issues to work out. Frasier cannot abide being beaten at chess by Martin (John Mahoney) in \"Chess Pains.\" Frasier and Niles ill-advisedly go into joint practice in \"Shrink Rap,\" and find themselves on the opposite sides of a sanity hearing in \"Crane vs. Crane.\" Lilith is sorely missed, but in this season's blast-from-the-past episode, Shelley Long returns in \"The Show Where Diane Comes Back.\" It is a joy to seeCheersresurrected, if only in Diane's self-absorbed new play, which Frasier agrees to back. And any episode with Frasier's amoral agent Bebe (Harriet Sansom Harris) is must-see television.Frasier's humor was character-based, rather than topical, giving it a longer shelf life. For those who lament the end of one of television's gold standard series, this boxed set will be excellent therapy.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006Q93AQ", "B0007Y08RY", "B000A0GOQY", "B000B5XOUC", "B000ERVJMW", "B000MX7V5W", "B0002WZTLQ", "B000VDDE0Y", "B006OKOWUY", "B0001NBNIY", "B0006IUDYY", "B0000E32X2", "B00008NV4G", "B000A0GOQ4", "B0007Y08JW", "B001HUHBAY", "B0012EM5EC", "B0019F02W6", "B000ERVJMM", "B000YKYT1M", "B000B5XOTS", "B000BNTM46", "B0007R4SWC", "B0002UE1WQ", "B0007YXRCW", "B00GHH9HW2", "B000AJJNJK", "B00HNGC56G", "B008LCRAFC", "B004D2GMVM", "B0002W4SWW", "B000A7PKGW", "B0051T47ZE", "B000C1VBAA", "B0007US79Y", "B00070HK4C", "B000GRUMQY", "B0000CGNEC", "B000B8I9ZY", "B0006Q93BU", "B008LCRAC0", "B0002W4SX6", "B00005JLEX", "B0009UC7MK", "B008LCRA7K", "B0019D151K", "B0007KTBJO", "B008LCRABQ", "B0007Y08P6", "B0012EM5EW", "B0001907BW", "B008LCRA98", "B008L0YMZA", "B001QE99AQ", "B001BN4WI6", "B000VDDE18", "B0002I84FS", "B000AJJNIQ", "B0001Z3I1C", "B000I2J6VE", "B000Z27H8Q", "B000EBGFQI", "B006MFQ4DE", "B00I458456", "B007C8RZYC", "B00005JLIC", "B000G6BL7O", "B000291Q3O", "B000NTMA1U", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B000HT3P60", "B00008979F", "B0089BSNQA", "B000QUEQ6I", "B000068V9X", "B000A9QKSM", "B009LDD1X0", "B0058JEI06", "B0002NY8PI", "B0001ZMWXW", "B0002NY8R6", "B004ES6TBS", "B001FSKE84", "B00BCMT3TO", "B00EYA6VF0", "B000FVQLIO", "B00BTFK01Y", "B00B04NII6", "B0007UDCX0", "B0009WFEEG", "0671003682", "B001FB4VXU", "B002TQKL16", "B005IA9JRM", "B00BUWD7E8", "B000W91RUG", "B00009Y3RW", "B001993YB8"], "bought_together": ["B0006Q93AQ", "B0007Y08RY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0006Q93AQ", "B000VDDE18", "B0007Y08RY", "B000B5XOUC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7631}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 15.47, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B0001NBNJ8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515wj4cZLtL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Frasier: Season 3"}
{"description": "The DVD extras forBarbershop 2are much like the movie itself--not  especially inspired or surprising, but raffish and likable. None of the  handful of deleted scenes seem unjustly left out, but a couple  (particularly the ones featuring Cedric the Entertainer) prove  entertaining. Of the two audio commentaries, the one by the director and  producers falls flat, full of a lot of self-congratulation; the less  self-conscious talk from the actors proves more amusing (with Cedric again  providing most of the wit). A couple of music videos (one with Mary J.  Blige and Eve, another with Sleepy Brown and Outkast) are enjoyable, but  the usual outtakes (actors laughing at their flubs) and still photos are  bland and perfunctory.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006RVJR", "B0009X7BFK", "B0002B14UW", "B000098XQ8", "B0014QLEI6", "B00066FAQW", "B001DJLD12", "B000VG66XS", "B000HDZKLO", "B00AEFYHVO", "B0034G4P1C", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B000093I8L", "B00003CY51", "6305505780", "B00005LB86", "B000FS9ULC", "B000069DOB", "0780631234", "B002CA68N4", "B000056BOW", "B00004STUL", "B00177YFYM", "1558908390", "B000YAF4Q6", "B003Y5H56K", "B005LAIH86", "B000RBA6C4", "B00AEFY6TW", "B00005JLQT", "B00004Y2R1", "B00AEFYAC0", "B002VKB0LU", "B002GSXKO2", "B0002J4YVK", "B00124ONGA", "B00HX0KIAM", "B001DJLCQS", "B002VWNICM", "B00004WLTP", "6304821832", "B000PE0GRI", "B00003W8NT", "B000BOH8X2", "B004FPE43K", "B001132GNY", "B003UEYBPI", "B00465I1CE", "B004BZ5AFA", "B0000YEE6M", "0783240201", "B0041QSZS8", "B00AEFYE08", "B001KKU9DM", "B0018RNF60", "B0006GAI5U", "B00005JPK8", "0780627822", "B0013ERFGE", "B0009W5JR8", "B00GOZ2LPM", "B008SOS7W8", "0783237367", "B002CA68MU", "B00066FAVW", "B00008977B", "B002NZK5QO", "B00005RIX5", "B004H83INW", "B002GSXKOM", "B000803BQC", "B00005JND5", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00005JLG1", "B000BITV9W", "B000F9SO0O", "B00005JLON", "B002ZG99RW", "B00066FAC6", "B00005JN4H", "B001P3SA94", "B000XT1P52", "B005LAIH1S", "0767811070", "B002CA68NO", "B00275EHHS", "B000BTITFI", "B0026JI1R2", "0767813901", "B00003GPFT", "B004WJT5E2", "B00E1LQEFE", "B0001MMGC2", "B000XSWVEC", "B000071ZZJ", "B00003CY5Y", "B00000JGHV", "B00005IBN0", "B008B9JTLI", "B0014BQR7Y"], "bought_together": ["B00006RVJR", "B0009X7BFK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00006RVJR", "B0009X7BFK", "B003UEYBPI", "B000098XQ8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 33314}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.19, "brand": "MGM", "asin": "B0001Q4BOE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514P1HEJ83L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Barbershop 2: Back in Business (Special Edition)"}
{"description": "\"Hi, I'm Ray and I live here in Long Island with my wife, Debra.\" Thus Ray (Ray Romano) introduces himself in the opening to each episode of his Emmy-winning comedy series. He proceeds to mention their children (Ally, Michael, and Geoffrey), then notes as an aside, \"It's not really about the kids.\" He's right--it isn't. They don't even appear in each episode.Everybody Loves Raymondlooks like any other family sitcom, but isn't. Everything is just a little bit better. Sure, it isn't as clever asSeinfeld(on which Romano and Brad Garrett appeared in their early days) or as sophisticated asFrasier; nor is it trying to be. The real subject of the show is Ray's relationship with Debra (Patricia Heaton), parents Frank and Marie (Doris Roberts and Peter Boyle), and brother Robert (Garrett).Everybody Loves Raymondtrains a microscope on the day-to-day ephemera of Ray's life. And since he's a sportswriter, a number of sports stars made guest appearances during the first season, including Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (\"Frank, the Writer\") and Terry Bradshaw (\"Debra's Sick\"), but this will happen less often in the years to come.On the surface, Ray has an ideal life, but he's always trying to please everyone; and someone inevitably feels left out. Sometimes it's Debra, sometimes Frank and Marie, sometimes Robert, and sometimes his buddies (includingKing of Queensstar Kevin James). Then there are his in-laws (Katherine Helmond and Robert Culp). If this were a different kind of show, Ray would have a breakdown at the end of each episode, but instead he finds a solution to each problem--and it usually comes from Debra. In short order,Everybody Loves Raymondbecame a top-rated program, with several cast members winning Emmys--numerous times in the case of small-screen scene-stealer Doris Roberts.-- Kathleen C.

{"description": "Some students aren't exactly what they seem to be in DECOYS, a sci-fi/horror adventure starring KimPoirier (Dawn of the Dead), Richard Burgi (Starship Troopers 2), Corey Sevier (TV's  North Shore ) and Nicole Eggert (TV's  Baywatch ). If college coeds Lily and Constance look like two out-of-this-world blonde beauties, that's because they're actually intergalactic space invaders with a mission: to breed with humans before taking over the Earth. And even though the girls  mating skills have proven fatal to their victims, they keep on trying.

{"description": "There will be a debate of which 2004 DVD collection of Marx Brothers films was better. This Universal release of the better known Paramount-produced films are the only ones starring all four brothers: Groucho, Chico, Harpo, and Zeppo. TheWarner collectioncontains less-vital films, but is loaded with extras and commentaries. The Universal collection contains only 20 minutes of interviews from NBC'sToday Show--interesting but short--with Harpo, Groucho, and Harpo's son Bill from the '60s and '70s. All of the films in this collection were released on DVD by Image Entertainment in 2000 and the prints look the same, which isn't necessarily bad; one just wishes a major restoration had been undertaken.The films--packaged handsomely with a booklet--are essential Marx Brothers, their first five films made from 1929 to 1933. The least timeless is their first,The Cocoanuts, based on their Broadway hit. The film--one of the first full talkies--takes place in a hotel with owner Groucho out to grab every dollar.Animal Crackersis the brothers' first classic, a lickety-split comedy about an art theft being investigated by Groucho's alter-image, Captain Spaulding. For introducing youngsters to the work of Marx,Monkey Businessis the best way. The shenanigans start right at the start as the brothers stowaway on a luxury liner. It's their first film that wasn't based on a play, as they endeavored to find new material.Horse Feathersgave them more fertile ground plus a sure-fire Hollywood director at the helm (Norman McLeoad). Their fantasia of college life includes the riotous football-game finale. Music, always a key part of their plays and films is given more weight here and includes Groucho's theme, \"I'm Against It.\" Music is again key as the musicals of the era are spoofed in the brothers' undisputed masterpiece,Duck Soup. From a land called Fredonia, Groucho plays a slapdash ruler who rewrites the rules of governing, leading to a most memorable war with Sylvania (so war gets lampooned. too).Duck Soupalso boasts the most famous Marx brothers sketch: Groucho trying to fool his mirror.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001HAIP4", "B00BY0EBDC", "B002TSAAAG", "B0001HAINQ", "B002ID099O", "B000LC4C0Q", "B0002KGXZO", "0879100362", "B000E6ESX0", "B00ILGPI9I", "B004P9UWM8", "B0000WN0PA", "B006WN5W5M", "B004P9UWL4", "B00006SFJ7", "0306806665", "B00JRHW4GK", "B000SSQ7JW", "B00406UJZG", "B0001FGBZW", "B00008ZZ7B", "B001FD6MJO", "B0002HS738", "B0001HAIMW", "B00KIZY3XW", "B005BYBZKY", "B00BX49C3S", "0517515466", "B00143XDYM", "0783228457", "B004P9UWLY", "B005DDN51A", "B0001JXP2A", "B003ZYU3T6", "1416536035", "B008FYZHHE", "B0024FAG1C", "B00005UMFC", "B005F265CU", "B004NWPXZS", "B00406UJWE", "B00000ILEU", "B0045HCJHG", "B0000648YD", "B000TXP56M", "B008M4C1BC", "B0081NAVGG", "B00CHMBQCU", "B001AXL67W", "B00005RDRL", "B005F265IE", "B000B5XORU", "B00A04YHI2", "B0007939MK", "B001EXE2Y2", "B0009W5J6E", "0783225903", "B00ESZZOLI", "B00006RCNV", "B0000BV1XX", "B007N31YH0", "B00023P4O2", "B002VWNIAY", "B000N3T0H8", "B002GSXKPQ", "B00AEFYR9G", "B00EO2I6RO", "B001B23ED6", "B00518A70E", "B007FQXEVY", "B0072BNJZ8", "B000E33W26", "B00J2PQZEY", "B0007ZEO8C", "B004UOHNH0", "B004GJYR7I", "B00IF0KASY", "B00CVB6XF2", "B00008RH3L", "B00005JKF6", "B0002AHW3G", "B00AMDA2OY", "B005EVY8MQ", "B00D9EJFZA", "B001E18222", "B0036FJ6OM", "B000E8JO32", "B000HT3PF6", "B0090XLDKY", "B000WGYMB0", "B00E44EZUE", "B000A1INJE", "B00005QEO0", "B00BY8DAAE", "B001IHJ988", "B001KXZGNW", "B00151QYYE", "B0009S4J3M", "B007REV4LQ", "B00004R99Y"], "bought_together": ["B0001HAIP4", "B00BY0EBDC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001HAIP4", "B004P9UWM8", "B002TSAAAG", "B0001HAINQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 36968}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 37.78, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

{"description": "There's not one cougar to be found in24's dynamic third season, and that's good news for everyone. After Jack Bauer's daughter Kim (Elisha Cuthbert) survived hokey hazards inseason 2, she's now a full-time staffer at CTU, the L.A.-based intelligence beehive that's abuzz once again--three years after the events of \"Day Two\"--when a vengeful terrorist threatens to release a lethal virus that could wipe out much of the country's population. Jack (Kiefer Sutherland) attempts to broker a deal for the virus involving drug kingpin Ramon Salazar (Joaquim de Almeida), whose operation Jack successfully infiltrated at high personal cost: to maintain his cover, he got hooked on heroin. That potentially deadly triangle--drug lords, addiction, and bioterrorism on a massive scale--sets the 24-hour clock ticking in a tight, action-packed plot involving a potential traitor in CTU's midst; the return of TV's greatest villainesses in Nina Meyers (Sarah Clarke) and former First Lady Sherry Palmer (Penny Johnson Jerald); a troubled romance between Kim and Jack's new partner Chase (James Badge Dale); and a scandalized reelection campaign by president David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert), who monitors CTU as they struggle to (literally) save the day.The intricately woven subplots that are24's greatest strength are masterfully developed here, and character arcs are equally strong, especially among CTU staffers Tony (Carlos Bernard) and his wife Michelle (Reiko Aylesworth); CTU director Ryan Chappelle (Paul Schulze), who is season 3's tragic bargaining chip; and the annoying but well-intentioned Chloe O'Brian (Mary Lynn Rajskub), who makes pivotal contributions with by-the-book efficiency. It's24's superior casting that overcomes the series' occasional lapses in credibility, and season 3's twists make marathon viewing a nerve-wracking delight. By the time it's all over,24once again leaves you gratefully exhausted. As always, Sutherland anchors the series in the role he was born to play. When Jack takes a private moment to release 24 hours' worth of near-fatal tension and psychological anguish, Sutherland proves that24's dramatic priorities are as important as its thriller momentum. DVD extras include behind-the-scenes featurettes (about the prison break sequence, climactic F-18 Hornet air-strike, and real-life bio-weaponry) that pay welcome tribute to the series' hard-working crew, who create Emmy-worthy television under pressures as intense as24itself.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008YGRU", "B000B837XI", "B000ICLRKC", "B000NDEXKW", "B000NDEXK2", "B000MR8W92", "B001L5SRJE", "B002ZCY7SW", "B001DMVZOE", "B0015QWZ8S", "B002ZCY7TG", "B00G4RCXPI", "0756632277", "B003PGNBO8", "B00AIBZMD6", "B003FSTN52", "B00J5LXT44", "B000YABIQ6", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B00HEPE6MM", "B003L77GK6", "B00005JOC9", "B002N5N5QQ", "B0024FAR5M", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B00HT850YW", "B001F12J0C", "B00BFAIH68", "B00JJRLFVS", "B005PPMHO2", "B00HUCF420", "B0049P1VHS", "B00ECHBSP8", "B00H57HOSC", "B00HGE90Z4", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00IKM5LXG", "B00AB65RUG", "B0058YPG1G", "B00J49R0ZQ", "B00JA3RVG4", "B00E8OMZGG", "B00EIXWMII", "B008JFUNTG", "B0058YPL66", "B00JF5GAZA"], "bought_together": ["B00008YGRU", "B000B837XI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00008YGRU", "B000NDEXK2", "B000ICLRKC", "B000NDEXKW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 4783}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 24.55, "brand": "20TH Century Fox", "asin": "B0002XVQSU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FD9X234WL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "24: Season 3"}
{"description": "With less drama and more slapstick than its predecessor, Disney'sMulan IIcontinues the animated saga of the young Chinese heroine, Fa Mulan (voiced by Ming-Na Wen, sung by Lea Salonga). The story picks up one month after Mulan has saved her country through bravery and determination. Revered by all, she now returns to her village and becomes engaged to General Li Shang. Wedding plans must wait, however, when the Emperor assigns the couple to a secret mission to escort his three princess daughters across China where their arranged marriages to waiting princes will secure an alliance with a rival kingdom and save China from invasion. Meanwhile, Mulan's wise-cracking guardian dragon, Mushu (voiced by Mark Moseley), realizes that if Mulan's marriage takes place, he is out of a job and so he undertakes his \"18-phase master plan\" of relationship sabotage to breakup the happy couple. Most of the film's jokes come from Moseley's Mushu (as quick-witted as Eddie Murphy's earlier performance), while a trio of prankish soldiers provide additional comic relief. While the film's overall effort is not as sensational as the original, it offers solid family entertainment, healthy female role models, and a handful of catchy songs.

{"description": "Mamoru Oshii's landmarkGhost in the Shell(1995) largely defined the cyberpunk genre  and influenced theMatrixfilms in the U.S. The long-awaited sequel continues the adventures of Batou, Major Kusanagi's former assistant, who was left behind when she disappeared into the cyber-realm of the Net. With his new human partner, Togusa, Batou investigates a series of bloody murders involvinggynoids, robots with sexual functions. The case leads them to the headquarters of the Locus Solus company, where Batou uncovers the evil secret behind the creation of thegynoids.Innocenceincludes some staggeringly beautiful CG images, especially a parade depicting characters from Chinese mythology. Oshii contrasts this glittering beauty with aBlade Runner-esque dystopia.

{"description": "Such a simple idea--yet so fiendishly complex in the execution.24, as surely everyone knows by now, is a thriller that takes places over 24 hours, midnight to midnight, in 24 one-hour episodes (well, 45-minute episodes if you subtract the commercials). Everything takes place in real time, which means no flashbacks, no flash-forwards, no handy time-dissolves. Every strand of the plot has to be dovetailed and interlocked so things happen just when they should, in the right amount of time. Not that easy. Creator Robert Cochran and his team of writers and directors have done an impressive job of putting the jigsaw together and keeping the tension ratcheted up high, as federal agent Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) runs around L.A. trying to stall an assassination attempt on an African American presidential candidate and rescue his wife and daughter from the clutches of the Balkan bad guys.In the second season, Jack is no longer on the government payroll; unfortunately for him, this small fact doesn't seem to matter to the president and the NSA, who call him back in to the CTU and give him 24 hours to infiltrate a terrorist organization that is planning to detonate a dirty bomb in the city of angels. Fans of the original won't be disappointed, as there are more than enough shock moments in the first few hours to hint at the climactic build-up to come, while newcomers can quickly get involved in the lives of Jack and his family.In the third season--three years after the events of \"Day Two\"--a vengeful terrorist threatens to release a lethal virus that could wipe out much of the country's population. Jack attempts to broker a deal for the virus involving a drug kingpin, setting the 24-hour clock ticking in a tight, action-packed plot involving a potential traitor in CTU's midst. The intricately woven subplots that are24's greatest strength are masterfully developed here, and character arcs are equally strong. It's24's superior casting that overcomes the series' occasional lapses in credibility, and season 3's twists make marathon viewing a nerve-wracking delight. As always, Sutherland anchors the series in the role he was born to play.", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B000NDEXK2", "B0002XVQSU", "B00008YGRU", "B0044E9JU0", "B002ZCY7SW", "B0027CSMWM", "B000XBPAOM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000NDEXK2", "B0002XVQSU", "B00008YGRU"]}, "price": 13.94, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 266159}, "asin": "B0006IO77I", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZFCXYZN9L._SX300_.jpg", "title": "24: Seasons 1-3"}

In the mid-1970's, the French government relaxed its immigration policy to allow the families of Algerian men to join them. Inch'Allah Dimanche provides us with a deeply moving memoir of the sense of isolation and vulnerability that the immigrant family experienced upon their arrival at a time when racial integration was virtually non-existent.Zouina (Fejria Deliba in a richly emotional performance) is a woman who is torn from her home in Algeria. With her three children and her abrupt mother-in-law, Aicha (Rabia Modedem), she rejoins her husband in a foreign and unaccommodating land. She finds herself feeling imprisoned between a distant husband who scorns her, a hostile mother-in-law and a neighbor (a comedic France Darry) who is afraid of Fejria's otherness. But Zouina's finally begins to feel a sense of acceptance when she meets a cosmetics factory worker who sparks in Zouina an interest in French culture and her new world. This curiosity, and her longing for freedom and experience, drives Zouina to take secret excursions with her children on Sundays, the one day that her husband and mother-in-law are out of the house. Through these little adventures, she comes to terms with the difficulties of immigration, change, and adaptation to a new culture.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002AG2NTI", "B00007J5VT", "B001THZAAI", "B000B58DHQ", "B0002TSZMO", "B00421IR5I", "B0009P7EI2", "B000I6BJ56", "B0084O26SI", "B0031SU2Y2", "B0069UV0AY", "B00005N89H", "B000811672", "1585102687", "B0087IT8FK", "B000YAA68W", "B000EMHWVE", "B000YPUFBA", "B002LE8MGW", "1585106364", "B000296E7W", "B00005JPX8", "B0000A1HQP", "B001EAWMEC", "B000UVV26A", "B00008979K", "B004XVMCOO", "B00023GG6C", "B0089MUDM6", "B001AZJKKK", "B0000C9JFO", "B00005J75R", "B0000YEENU", "158510373X", "1438072597", "B004SEUIXS", "B0002S64SM", "B001O549EI", "B005V4X8PO", "1585102695", "B00CEIOGZG", "B002L5NYMS", "B000NVT0RU", "B00001W9FZ", "B0007LI3JC", "B001CIOCLC", "B003V5EH6E", "158510258X", "B000UAE7MM", "B00ENMZK1A", "B00GMV8B1G", "B0031REQKE", "0738610607", "B0009NSAF0", "B000MTEFP0", "B0009WFFWC", "B000YNFXRS", "B00020BW64", "B0009S4J1E", "B002O0LJWC", "B0001IN0MQ", "B000F6IHR2", "B0006U0RQ6", "B0006Z2NKO", "B00005JM48", "0780030044", "B00CXI8HMK", "1585104043", "158510275X", "B00EV1YZKK", "2253113751", "B0002C4JIK", "1438074042", "B0002EJ7LM", "B004GFGUAE", "B0036TGSJE", "1585103942", "B00FGVS07S", "B000SSQ7JC", "B000KBB1IY", "B000E5LEV0", "B000093NR0", "B007USWCXS", "B000053VBN", "B0007TZHWA", "B00005Y727", "B003Y7D7BU", "B001M72J68", "2070368076", "B00ABW5Q3I", "B000WC38IC", "220300102X", "B00075XYDS", "B005E7SEK2", "B0041ONFLM", "B003H0ZHGM", "B002LC3M32", "B006IW8E3Y", "B003ICZW8W"], "bought_together": ["B002AG2NTI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002TSZMO", "B002AG2NTI", "B000B58DHQ", "B0000C9JFO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 75510}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.74, "brand": "", "asin": "B0007A61K6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516E7J6HBXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Inch'Allah Dimanche"}

{"description": "Like a groovy Family von Trapp,The Partridge Familyarrived in 1970 with matching velvet outfits and wholesomeness bursting from every pore. Watching it now, you expect little more than kitsch--but the show, though certainly a sitcom representation of the world, is curiously fresh and appealing. This sheer likeability comes partly from the cast--Shirley Jones (The Music Man) looks foxy in miniskirts while still being the cool mom everyone wishes they had; teen idol David Cassidy is unexpectedly engaging as an actor (his charisma is all the more apparent when another teen idol, Bobby Sherman, makes a wooden appearance); and Danny Bonaduce's child-star rise sprang not from cuteness but his genuine comic timing. It doesn't hurt that many of the troubles the characters faced--swelled heads, rivalry, groupies (!)--were undoubtedly problems the actors were facing  as their show became a hit.Sure, there are utterly ridiculous episodes, such as when Danny is tutoring a mob boss's girlfriend about the stock market and the gangster, not knowing Danny is only 10 years old, gets jealous--but most episodes feature ordinary show business conflicts or straightforward family issues, like how the kids cope when their mother starts dating or how teenager Laurie (Susan Dey, who later went on toL.A. Law) feels ugly when she gets braces. This simplicity, combined with some classic vaudeville-style humor, proves surprisingly durable. Plus, the list of guest stars ranges from Ray Bolger (best known as the Scarecrow inThe Wizard of Oz) to a young Richard Pryor, as well as other soon-to-be-famous folk likeCharlie's Angels' Farrah Fawcett and Jaclyn Smith and a pre-Star WarsMark Hamill. The first season collection includes a bonus CD with four of the Partridge Family's actual radio hits; their sound, a fusion of the Monkees and the Mamas and the Papas, is pure pop sugar (created by a host of Brill Building songwriters like Neil Sedaka). If the Mondrian-inspired paint job on the Partridge Family bus gives you childhood flashbacks, you'll happily regress when you watch this box set.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000B6CODY", "B001LRTT3A", "B001DHE9FQ", "B0006Z2L4W", "B00701QR86", "B0009I7NH6", "B000A0GORS", "B000B5XOUM", "B000CCBCHQ", "B0012GMXPQ", "B0009B16TO", "B000E33VZ4", "B000TV4QWS", "B0012GMZAO", "B005FLD3KS", "B000EXZFS0", "B000E3L7EQ", "B00004OCRR", "B000291Q3Y", "B000MGBSEY", "B00005JO4F", "B0050MB5AC", "B00DXLO0BI", "B00003TFNR", "B000HIVIOM", "B00005JOEB", "B000EQ45BU", "B00008WJEZ", "B000HEZEYG", "B0007CNY54", "B000E3L7FK", "B000FI8MQG", "B0014FAIYS", "B000291Q3O", "B000P6R9O4", "0446395315", "B000PISZ86", "B000002OND", "B000ASDFIQ", "B0012GN19S", "B0012GMWQG", "B0002JZT5U", "B005R2SHX8", "B00280QNKG", "B000002VGR", "B005FLD3EE", "B000095J74", "B000Z6GT18", "B000B8IA3U", "0755315804", "0060950757", "B0009B16TY", "B000FSMEB0", "B00DXLO0D6", "B0012GN0YO", "B00JAD6BYW", "B0000V4906", "B001LRTT30", "B00008EYBH", "B00A2L1CKO", "B00ERH175Y", "B000H1RFF0", "B0009UC80G", "B00AEFXKIK", "B0001DMXEC", "B00005JLIC", "B008H6GHII", "B0000DFZ5O", "B000KLQUSK", "B00HZMZ286", "B000C6NPHC", "B00HVFA36I", "0755315790", "B0002NY8PI", "B003W5C0TY", "B000TD48SI", "B000FDFSH2", "B0006BAWSI", "B00GOC74RU", "B00BUWD7NE", "B001LRL4Y2", "B00DXLO086", "B00018D3RI", "B00007KK5I", "B000VS6R30", "B000G0O5J6", "B001E6JC30", "B001NRPQKI", "B000LE16VC", "B00465I17Y", "B0019BI114", "B00G5N6C8U", "B005LFQRTC", "B000EQ5PTQ", "B00A4Y62JU", "B000NQRV8U", "B000MGBSQM", "B00IF0KAYS", "B000CELOV8", "B00BO9PJAM"], "bought_together": ["B000B6CODY", "B001DHE9FQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DXLO0BI", "B0009I7NH6", "B00DXLO0D6", "B000B5XOUM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 39867}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 8.8, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0007V6IWQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51v03PoYtKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Partridge Family - The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "This high-voltage concert film shot in New Orleans, features the sensational Richard Pryor in his prime. Doing some of his most innovative material, Pryor takes charge on stage with an electrifying style and an unequaled comedic genius, in an incredibly funny performance guaranteed to rock you withside-splitting laughter!    If Richard Pryor were accused of being the funniest man in America, this film of his incredible stage act would be Exhibit A. It is proof beyond the shadow of a doubt! Shot live at the Hollywood Palladium, the film captures all the excitement, lunacy and electric force of a Pryor performance. And though he's the only star of this hilarious show, he's never alone on stage. With him is his amazing array of characterizations as he talks about his trip to Africa in search of his roots, his early days playing one-night gigs in Mafia-owned clubs and strip joints, and numerous other outrageous topics. Finally, he talks about Pryor on Fire - a recounting of the accident which nearly took his life -an episode he relates with wit and a touch of poignancy.

{"description": "American detectives are usually played by tough guys and busty babes, but the British have more esoteric tastes: The sleuths ofRosemary & Thymeare a pair of middle-aged ladies with a horticulture business.  Rosemary Boxer (Felicity Kendal, star of the classic BritcomGood Neighbors), a former academic, teamed up with new divorcee (and former policewoman) Laura Thyme (Pam Ferris,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban) over a murder case involving poisonous weeds and oozing red sap--plants and murder have been intertwined ever since. A dying lawn leads to a pretty Polish blonde pushed from a roof; while Rosemary tosses off tidbits about Victorian gardening techniques and the Latin name for the early spider orchid, the bones of a buried racehorse reveal other secrets. In one clever episode, flowers are the murder weapon themselves (though to say how would spoil the fun). Some mystery aficionados may findRosemary & Thymea bit abrupt; the hour-long format doesn't allow for the elegant unfolding and deft misdirection of an Agatha Christie adaptation. But the interplay between rambunctious Rosemary and pragmatic Laura is addictive, and the suggestion--spoken aloud in one episode, but underlying the entire series--that English flora respond to the evil deeds of humankind lends an almost metaphysical air to the pair's dual pursuits.

{"description": "Available only as a fragment for decades, Siren of the Tropics is Josephine Baker's feature film debut. Made in 1927, around the time Josephine was making a Paris splash as a Folies Berg+&#xA8;re star, Siren establishes the rags to riches, fairy tale template from which her subsequent films would be cut.  Josephine plays Papitou, a free-spirited, animal-loving native girl who falls in love with Andre, a sophisticated young man who has been sent to the Parisian Antilles as a prospector. She is unaware that he is betrothed to another, or that his work assignment is actually a perilous ruse concocted by his scheming boss, the Marquis Severo. As the truth becomes known, Papitou finds herself pursuing Andre back to Paris, where fate intervenes. Will Papitou's new job as a music hall performer (a natural role for La Baker) bring the romantic resolution she so desperately desires?  Though silent,  Siren Of The Tropics abounds with musical energy, aided in no small part by Josephine Baker's innate screen magnetism. The film contains perhaps her greatest dance work on celluloid, the frenetic \"Charleston.\" Among the crew was a very young Luis Bu+&#xDD;uel!", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000OQDX3Q", "B0009CTTZG", "B0009CTTYM", "B004S801XG", "B000V3IX82", "B00014NF66", "B00000JMOO", "B000KRNGOA", "B00005M1ZO", "B001QEIHQ8"], "bought_together": ["B000OQDX3Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005AQML", "B000OQDX3Q", "B0009CTTYM", "B0009CTTZG"]}, "price": 17.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 367010}, "asin": "B0009CTTX8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NSNTMTYTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Siren of the Tropics"}

{"description": "Dark Wateris Japanese horror auteur Hideo Nakata's return to the genre after hisRingcycle made you too scared to watch television ever again. WhereRingudealt with a supernatural force wreaking revenge via technology, this film is a much more traditional ghost story. After winning a custody battle for her daughter, single mother Yoshimi moves into what she thinks is the perfect apartment with her daughter Hitomi. No sooner have they unpacked than strange things begin to disturb their new life. A water leak from the supposedly abandoned apartment above gets bigger and bigger, a child's satchel reappears even though Yoshimi throws it away several times, and she is haunted by the image of a child wearing a yellow mackintosh who bears a striking resemblance to a young girl who disappeared several years before. The conventional narrative follows Yoshimi's increasingly desperate attempts to discover who or what force is haunting her daughter, but the story's execution is far from predictable. Nakata is the master of understated suspense: there's always a feeling of motiveless malignancy that runs like an undercurrent through his films--far more frightening than out and out shocks--and here he also practically drowns his audience in water imagery. The film is saturated; the relentless dripping in the apartment, the constant rain outside and the deliberately washed-out photography make any color, such as the yellow coat, seem incongruous and unsettling. Nakata also clears the film of unnecessary characters--this is an almost deserted Tokyo--preferring to concentrate the action on Yoshimi's rising hysteria as she struggles to understand what is happening and how to save her daughter. Granted, the special effects are somewhat unconvincing and the ending confused, but even so the result is a stylish and disquieting chiller that will do for bathtubs what hisRingfilms did for video recorders.--Kristen Bowditch", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000GSYRY6", "B000E0OE4O", "B00005JNJR", "B000GB5MOW", "B000LPS3B2", "B000H0M4CK", "B000E3LGMY", "B000A2XA8M", "B004O63TWW", "B00DW5IM14", "B000AWYOGE", "B000Q7ZKWU", "B000088NQR", "B0000AVHAO", "B000FS9FIA", "B003UTPL2A", "B000FVQYW2", "B000MEYKCI", "B000FZEQEQ", "B002P7UCJK", "B0000CC885", "B0009KQOZQ", "B0009WFEDC", "B000H5U5YO", "B000MM0LHS", "B0007XBM8O", "B000NO243E", "B000CSTKHE", "B0009X765K", "B0006SGYL0", "B000AAF25S", "B000MM0LH8", "B0018JKLT2", "B000GBEWNY", "B001KEGR66", "B000FZEQFK", "B0028DRGDQ", "B00BOYLIAC", "B000NA28GG", "B00136MBUW", "B0019X3YX2", "B00005LW4G", "B0002ZDW7Q", "B000CRR3ME", "B004P2VQZ2", "B0007CNY2W", "B0009YA3YA", "B000BVM240", "B00260LDSU", "B0009S2T0M", "B0002J4X20", "B002E2QH8G", "B00009MEC4", "B000FZEQVY", "B0000YAEHK", "B002U041OE", "B00HI9QDXO", "B001570H5K", "B00AEFYYH6", "B000NA21RM", "B0015ET3YO", "B0007GAG42", "B0009NCQL4", "B000F0UUMI", "B001VG2MAI", "B004H2CXBQ", "B00104AYG0", "B001MEJY8W", "B00125WAW8", "B000BGH2A4", "B000AM4PGI", "B001P3SA9Y", "B000EDWKZ6", "B0010SAGHS", "B000A2X3U2", "B0009W5KHW", "B000S0GYRU", "B00344EAM8", "B005D0RDPM", "B001221DUQ", "B0000CABGW", "B002OMIKSG", "B00BUBE2N4", "B008NNY8XQ", "B00019JR5Y", "B00AEFY2E6", "B0009XRZQK", "B006L4MWVE", "B00BOUXNNQ", "B00004W3HF", "B008G1JIQC", "B007I1Q4IG", "B000R7HY32", "B00GHH9IIA", "B0009X763M", "B00006AUIG", "B00009OWI1", "B0001EFV7M", "B000IMUYJM", "B0016MJ6KQ"], "bought_together": ["B000E0OE4O", "B000GSYRY6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000AWYOGE", "B00DW5IM14", "B000GSYRY6", "B0009WFEDC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 135749}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.99, "brand": "ADV Films", "asin": "B0009KA2UO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41KFCTBTH3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dark Water"}
{"description": "Broadcast to record ratings on the TNT cable network, thisRaiders-esque adventure does not go by the book, staring with its atypical action hero and his decidedly uncool profession. Flynn Carsen (Noah Wylie fromE.R.) is a thirtysomething perpetual student who still lives with his mother (Olympia Dukakis). When his exasperated professor finally ejects him into the real world, Carsen's Holmesian deductive acumen lands him a job as the librarian at the Metropolitan Library. This is not an ordinary library. It houses history's most mythic artifacts, including the Ark of the Covenant, Pandora's Box, and the sword Excalibur. The fate of the world is in Carsen's hands (\"That's so sad,\" he observes) when the dread Serpent Brotherhood steals the library's Spear of Destiny, and Carsen must retrieve it. His reluctant, and antagonistic, partner is Nicole (Sonya Walger), who is as skilled in martial arts as Carsen is schooled in the Dewey Decimal System. Bob Newhart and Jane Curtin add welcome comic relief, with Newhart, of all people, getting into the action by film's end. The humble hero (who would rather be known as \"Flynn, the rather pleasant at parties\"), somewhat cheesy special effects, and corny comedy makeThe Librariana fun guilty pleasure. As Carsen proclaims, \"Being a librarian is actually a cool job.\" This looks like the beginning of a beautiful franchise.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000IJ7A24", "B001MVYUQG", "B001RXDM1I", "B0002J58GU", "B003KW7CQ0", "B003QJC208", "B001L2ZSFS", "B003XEKUBY", "B003MX91H0", "B004I1K2FK", "B0013BM63O", "B00K2CHW48", "B00005JN5E", "B00GOHZLDO", "B002ZG99KO", "B001GF8WP8", "B00BUELRXO", "B0009PBLU4", "B0000YEEPS", "B00FR23QNE", "B008L0YMVE", "B00K2CHWYI", "B00F3L8P26", "B00FE5MX74", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00IWTVDUW", "6305428514", "B004LROMWU", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B00GTZWXYQ", "B00AEBB8QK", "0792839137", "B000BW7QWW", "B00005JM5B", "B0016Q2D5M", "B00KS9V6EC", "B00HJAB094", "B004UXVDOA", "B003UYUQZW", "B0006GAOCW", "B004LROMS4", "B00ECW9UJY", "B00F84H73Q", "B003L77FYS", "B009RX7IX8", "B009AMAKWM", "B001XRLWPQ", "B002NZK5RI", "B0011FLGZQ", "B003F3NDWG", "B00LG6XHDY", "B000MMMTD2", "B00K2CHX9C", "B000Y11BC6", "B00IYRLUAU", "B000KJU18C", "B005TTEG5W", "B000ASATYY", "B00EIXWMII", "B0014C2FX8", "B00E5I2M6I", "B008JFUNTG", "B00GSTHC7G", "B0041PSQF6", "B0090SI56Y", "B003R4ZMPE", "B00DL48BM6", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B00E5I2M9K", "B007R6DJP8", "B00BEIYH1A", "B004LWZW4M", "B005G4TJUC", "B002NZK5WS", "B00B9UEOPC", "B00AEFY3MC", "B00D6I7GHS", "B00J11U54K", "6305236569", "B00AIBZMD6", "B006WK4Y8Q", "B0056GLNQI", "B0053O89KG", "B00GTZWUPS", "B00HF98SHG", "B000FO0AA6", "B008JFUO72", "B00GZP0M2K", "B007CF6S1Q", "006219481X", "0783232047", "B0006GANOQ", "B00FEVZ960", "B005SZED64", "B004TJ1H3C", "B006WK4Y6I", "B00KQTHKQC", "B00BN0WQ5I", "B00AIBZMM2"], "bought_together": ["B000IJ7A24", "B001MVYUQG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005GELLQC", "B001MVYUQG", "B000IJ7A24", "B001RXDM1I"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 4677}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0009NSCRQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ark9kN2IL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Librarian - Quest for the Spear"}
{"description": "The sci-fi-themed teen dramaRoswellbegins its third and final season with Max (Jason Behr) and Liz (Shiri Appleby) back together and taking a desperate chance to find Max's son.  After the many cosmic concepts of the previous season, the series dialed back the mythology to focus on the more--excuse the expression--humanaspects of the characters.Roswellwas often described asDawson's CreekmeetsThe X-Files, and accordingly Isabel (Katherine Heigl) finds romance with a lawyer (Adam Rodriguez), but struggles both with her mixed feelings about revealing her alien identity and with the aftermath of the tragedy in season 2.  (The romance is later spoofed in aBewitched-style episode.) At the same time, Max and Michael (Brendan Fehr) travel to Los Angeles in search of an alien bounty hunter that might be able to help them find Max's son.  (They also findRoswellexecutive producer Jonathan Frakes making a guest appearance as himself.)  Michael takes a night job that at first is played for laughs (in \"Michael, the Gang, and the Great Snapple Caper\"), then takes on threatening implications in a rousing two-parter that eventually leaves all parties not too much different from how they started.  Michael also struggles in his relationship with Maria (Majandra Delfino), first when he makes new friends and later when she meets a figure from her past (Clayne Crawford) who revives a longtime music dream that might lead to bigger things.  All the while, the alien trio faces the constant struggle of keeping their identities secret, even as the net seems to be tightening around them.  When a key character returns in the series' penultimate episode, both the aliens and the humans they love face a critical decision.TheDawson's Creekcomparison is also valid in an undesirable way: many of the background songs that characterized the series have been replaced for DVD due to licensing expenses.  Newcomers to the series, of course, probably won't notice.  Four episodes have commentary tracks, two by Frakes, who has some interesting information but leaves dead air and introduces characters we already know.  Better are the tracks by executive producer/writer Ronald D. Moore on theBewitchedspoof and by creator Jason Katims on the series finale.  Other features are a 13-minute summary of the season and Shiri Appleby's appearance on Japanese TV to publicize the DVD release of the first season in 2004.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00133QNS6", "B00133QNRW", "B000NOKFGW", "B00005YU87", "B002QZDSW4", "B001ILFUB4", "B0009A407A", "B000F3UAE8", "B000FJH5M2", "B000OCXNQW", "B0001907BC", "B000O77SN6", "B0009JE6FC", "B0011FLGZQ", "B00177YA10", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B00166UFTI", "B000092T3Y", "B0006J28DW", "B003R0MF6W", "B000O77SMW", "B000I0QLR8", "B00IWTVDUW", "B0077PTWHI", "B0051GOB2G", "B0001I55S8", "B0002234R2", "B00022FWEU", "B00JF5G8WU", "B0009JE6G6", "B000BOH990", "B0002XVKMM", "B002HMTX84", "B000AO9BSS", "B002ETTGD2", "B000I0QLRI", "B00008AOX3", "B000EXDS3E", "B000VSDNFA", "B0077PTWY6", "B0024FAR66", "B000CNE0T2", "B000I0QLQY", "B000BNXD6O", "B000QDLSR0", "B00HQOFAKI", "B0037AGB9O", "B005DCJ0Q0", "B000EXDS3Y", "B000EXDS34", "B000FOPPBA", "B00127RAGM", "B001CQONMC", "B0007V6IW6", "B004SMDJ9U", "B000EHSVMS", "B000BOH98G", "B000CNE0SS", "B0001IN0T4", "B002JVWR4U", "B000EHSVM8", "B0024FAD9C", "B0000E5NPY", "B001MVWRN4", "B00HUPC5X8", "B00GHH9HBI", "B0002RQ3MK", "B00GHH9IAI", "B00005JM39", "B001MVWRMU", "0671035649", "B004WO9OMA", "B000EAT23C", "B00B5ARKC0", "B001MVWRMK", "B000EHSVLE", "B009LDCWWG", "0671035614", "B003L77GWE", "B000I0QLS2", "B001MVWRNE", "B000EHSVKK", "B000YDOOEQ", "B000CNE0TC", "B008X6N8KW", "B0006UEVUE", "B0085KGG96", "B00CRVL5ZE", "B00BD6K54G", "B005X4P3DC", "B007AFC0W4", "B001MVWRNO", "B001B7CNZ6", "B001DF681G", "B000I0QLRS", "B00DPJEWD4", "B004YPED14", "B002N5N5MK", "B000SULWKO", "B004TJ1H3C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00133QNS6", "B00133QNRW", "B000NOKFGW", "B000JJ6K0Q"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 133486}, "asin": "B0009NZ2RY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5183MTPXA7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Roswell - The Complete Third Season (The Final Chapter)"}
{"description": "Based on the classic fairytale by Charles Perrault, this 1988 Cannon Group production ofPuss in Bootsis a musical movie-tale that spurns self-imposed limitations and proposes that anything is possible with a little imagination and a firm belief in oneself.  The story opens with a dying miller bequeathing his cat Puss to his youngest son Corin (Jason Connery).  Corin sets out with his paltry inheritance to make a new life for himself, but is quickly besieged by strange visions of his cat Puss (Academy Award-winner Christopher Walken) taking on human form.  Puss promises that all will be well if Corin will just buy him a pair of boots and, despite many misgivings, Corin buys Puss the boots and finds that they somehow enable Puss to maintain human form.  The clever Puss in Boots devises a plan to ensure his master's lasting happiness, gaining access to the King (Yossi Graber) where he fancifully describes Corin as the wealthy and noble Marquis of Carabas.  When the King summons the Marquis of Carabas, Corin falls in love with the Princess Vera (Carmela Marner) and struggles to somehow live up to his new title in order to win her hand in marriage. While a relatively low-budget production, the songs and dances make this version of the classicPuss in Bootsfun for the entire family.

{"description": "He pops pills, watches soaps, and always, always says what's on his mind. He's Dr. Gregory House (Emmy nominee Hugh Laurie,Blackadder). Producers David Shore, Bryan Singer, Katie Jacobs, and Paul Attanasio haven't rewritten the hospital drama--at heart, it's a cross betweenSt. Elsewhere,ER, andC.S.I.--but they've infused a moribund genre with new life and created one of TV's most compelling characters. More than any previous medical procedural, it resembles Attanasio&#x92;s underratedGideon's Crossing, butHouseis lighter on its feet. As fascinating as he is, the show wouldn't work as well if it were all House all the time (that would be like Sherlock Holmes without Watson or Moriarty). Fortunately, he's joined by an intriguing cast of characters, portrayed by a combination of experienced vets (Omar Epps, Lisa Edelstein, Tony winner Robert Sean Leonard) and new faces (Jennifer Morrison, Jesse Spencer). Aside from the complicated cases they tackle each week, the sparks really fly when House's brilliant, if na&#xEF;ve charges are put to the test--and as the head of a teaching hospital, it's his job to test them (although his tough love approach is constantly landing him in hot water with Edelstein's administrator). From the first episode,Houseattracted a talented array of guests, including Robin Tunney (\"Pilot\"), Joe Morton (\"Role Model\"), and Patrick Bauchau (\"Cursed\") as Spencer&#x92;s father. In addition, Chi McBride and Sela Ward appear frequently (with Ward returning for the second season). Viewers who first watched these 22 episodes on Fox will be gratified to note that the music has survived the transition to disc, such as the Rolling Stones' \"You Can't Always Get What You Want,\" as featured in both the pilot and season finale (\"Honeymoon\"). The only apparent omission is the credit theme (Massive Attack's \"Teardrop\") from the pilot.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Movie studios, by and large, avoid controversial subjects like race the way you might avoid a hive of angry bees. So it's remarkable thatCrasheven got made; that it's a rich, intelligent, and moving exploration of the interlocking lives of a dozen Los Angeles residents--black, white, latino, Asian, and Persian--is downright amazing. A politically nervous district attorney (Brendan Fraser) and his high-strung wife (Sandra Bullock, biting into a welcome change of pace fromMiss Congeniality) get car-jacked by an oddly sociological pair of young black men (Larenz Tate and Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges); a rich black T.V. director (Terrence Howard) and his wife (Thandie Newton) get pulled over by a white racist cop (Matt Dillon) and his reluctant partner (Ryan Phillipe); a detective (Don Cheadle) and his Latina partner and lover (Jennifer Esposito) investigate a white cop who shot a black cop--these are only three of the interlocking stories that reach up and down class lines. Writer/director Paul Haggis (who wrote the screenplay forMillion Dollar Baby) spins every character in unpredictable directions, refusing to let anyone sink into a stereotype. The cast--ranging from the famous names above to lesser-known but just as capable actors like Michael Pena (Buffalo Soldiers) and Loretta Devine (Woman Thou Art Loosed)--meets the strong script head-on, delivering galvanizing performances in short vignettes, brief glimpses that build with gut-wrenching force.

Add to this confluence of oddities a subplot involving clones of Danes, a murder plot hatched by her brother, and Penn as Phoenix's eccentric sibling who periodically weighs in from a plane, and you've got an occasionally impenetrable (and not particularly romantic) picture that may baffle fans of the stars' Hollywood efforts.

{"description": "In this third season, Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore), she of the \"bright smile and infectious vivacity,\" got to display some of that celebrated \"spunk\" of hers. In the season&#x96;opener, \"The Good-Time News,\" she demands to be paid the same amount of money as her predecessor. In \"The Georgette Story,\" she defies her boss, Lou Grant (Ed Asner), and vainglorious anchorperson Ted Baxter (Ted Knight) by counseling Ted's new girlfriend, whom he takes for granted. And in \"Romeo and Mary,\" she finally stands up to an overzealous suitor (guest star Stuart Margolin), which hilariously backfires on her.The Mary Tyler Moore Showendures because its timeless comedy is drawn from the wellspring of its fully drawn characters, who were allowed to grow beyond one-note caricatures. Mary's best friend, Rhoda (Valerie Harper), who was in danger of becoming this series' Sally Rogers, really blossomed this season. In \"Rhoda the Beautiful,\" the slimmed-down Rhoda is empowered to enter a beauty contest, and in \"My Brother's Keeper,\" she catches the eye of Phyllis' (Cloris Leachman in an Emmy-nominated performance) brother, which devastates Phyllis, setting the stage for yet another disastrous Mary Richards party (and a d&#xE9;nouement that must have been daring in 1973). Wise-cracking Murray (Gavin McLeod) reveals new depths in \"Murray Faces Life,\" in  which he sinks into depression after hearing that a former college classmate has won the Pulitzer Prize. Even Ted manages to surprise. In \"Operation: Lou,\" a hospitalized Lou Grant finds a new appreciation for Ted, who graciously and uncharacteristically, presents him with an expensive bottle of scotch. Moore, Harper, and Knight were each honored with Emmys this season. Joining this august core ensemble is Georgia Engel as Georgette, who makes a delightful first impression in \"Rhoda Morgenstern: Minneapolis to New York.\" Even hard-boiled Lou softens in her presence. \"You're a real cutie, you know that?\" he tells her in \"The Georgette Story.\" Despite Lou's insistence to the contrary in \"The Good-Time News,\"The Mary Tyler Moore's job was to make people laugh. But it could also be surprisingly moving, as in the laugh-free dramatic climax of \"Remembrance of Things Past,\" in which Mary is reunited with an ex-boyfriend (Joseph Campanella), who has broken her heart in the past. This three-disc set contains no extras, but any of these episodes can take a nothing day and suddenly... well, you know the rest.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EXDS02", "B00096S480", "B0011N19HI", "B00005JLIC", "B002WN8IR0", "B003VTKZ84", "B000E6ES9Y", "B001O4KBN2", "B000G6BL7O", "B000A9QKSM", "B003CNQPME", "B002C8YSBU", "B000YKYT1M", "B00144K5M4", "B0000AZKKP", "B0001IN0BC", "B004083REE", "1451659202", "B00009VRF0", "B001OXLGK0", "B0006Q93BU", "B00HRUQB5O", "B00GOC74QG", "B00GHH9HW2", "B000EQ5PTQ", "B00274SIVK", "B000A0GOP0", "B00016XN48", "B000YGGNGK", "B00KTZALDC", "B0006IUDYY", "B000TD0PHG", "B00023B1WQ", "B004ES6TBS", "B005E7SEOI", "B00HNGC56G", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B000UX6TKM", "B00FM4S7P4", "B000MGTQ6G", "B0000AUXVS", "B008MIYKB2", "B000Z27H8Q", "B0002Y4T7O", "B005BUA1JY", "B006VC3L9S", "B000E3L7EQ", "B002E58FTC", "B0028SVY3E", "B000RXZL0E", "B001DZOCVO", "B0007TKG76", "B005DCJ0Q0", "B000NTMA1U", "B002E58FTW", "B00CL152AY", "B001LRTT30", "B000G0O5J6", "B002E58FU6", "B000QUEQ6I", "B0007WFY4S", "B00GLPYVT4", "B000C1VBAA", "B000AJJNJK", "B002E58FUG", "B00IFK7ONI", "B000G0O5JG", "B000PISZ86", "B000F8O2MO", "B00DXLO086", "B0002NY8R6", "B00008EYBH", "B008VNI9TC", "B000G6BLDI", "1451659229", "B00HXH5WNI", "B001IXXYCE", "B003JHXS5A", "B00G5N6C8U", "B002FLOTFO", "B00GOC74RU", "B00JHH1VUU", "B00BHWG0N6", "B004WO9OMA", "B002E58FT2", "B0030ATZH6", "B000MQ4WMY", "B00008EY6N", "B006VC3L48", "B000VDDE1I", "B002E58FTM", "B0031XYLR6", "B0001NBNIY", "B00280QNKG", "B0089BSLKS", "B002OOWKVM", "B0095FJHWI", "B0011FLGYM", "B00IF0KAYS", "B002ACKBTG"], "bought_together": ["B00096S480", "B000EXDS02"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JLIC", "B00096S480", "B002WN8IR0", "B000EXDS02"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 19038}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.03, "brand": "20TH CENTURY FOX HOME ENTMNT", "asin": "B000BOH8YQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41CMP7NGC6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Mary Tyler Moore Show: The Complete Third Season"}
{"description": "Following in the tradition of such great World War II films as \"Saving Private Ryan\" and \"Patton\", \"The Great Raid\" tells the true story of an American rescue mission that took place over five days in January, 1945. Cabanatuan prison was located some thirty miles behind Japanese lines. Inside its walls were over 500 American prisoners. Many were survivors of the Bataan death march. These men had been improsoned for over three years. Many began to feel that their country had left them behind.\n\nBy late 1944, the Americans had returned to the Philippines. After learning about the existance of Cabanatuan, the Americans devised a plan to send an elite group of Army Rangers in to resue the POWs. Lt. Col. Henry Mucci (Benjamin Bratt), commander of the 6th Ranger Batallion, was given the assignment of developing the mission. Captain Robert Prince (James Franco) was placed in charge of planning and actually carrying out the raid. The Rangers would have to travel thirty miles into enemy-held territory, much of the time in broad daylight with very little cover. Fortunately, they received a great deal of help from the Filipino resistance.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFXRRO", "B00AEFXVCU", "B00AEBBA36", "B0015D20FE", "B000M4RG42", "B00005PJ8T", "B000065U1N", "B000095WW8", "B001IBIHQ4", "B00006CXSS", "B00AEBB86U", "B00005JPKE", "B00001ZWUS", "B00005N5S3", "B00005JK8K", "0471037427", "038549565X", "0792839730", "B001KZOUU0", "B00C2535TE", "B0007TKNGA", "B00HEPE6MM", "079284646X", "B007HCI42A", "B000EHSVSC", "B000MGTQ7U", "B003ASLJOU", "B004C45AZU", "B000WMA6R8", "B00772M1D8", "B000E0WJN2", "B000ELL1R6", "B00BTYNXL4", "B005LAIGYQ", "B000MRA542", "B00005AVZU", "B003ELKNH2", "B000E5N6KW", "B00003CXHJ", "0792844017", "B00005PJ8K", "B000O599YO", "B00AEFYBA6", "B00003CXTG", "B0007KIFGE", "B00004XPPG", "B003AWRMCO", "B005DKS1TE", "B007WXUVHU", "B000R9U3B0", "B005OTGS4E", "B000066C6J", "B000EHSVS2", "B00005PJ8S", "B00005U8F4", "B00BY0EBK0", "B00005R87B", "B00096S4B2", "B00AEFYENK", "B00005JKTP", "B008JFUNKU", "B000P0J09C", "B00004XPPC", "B002EAYE0Q", "B00275EGWY", "B00008AOTR", "B002OGMGV4", "B001PO55LE", "B002O3Z510", "B00AEBB86A", "B00D3XMA9A", "B00DL48BM6", "0792838408", "B00AEFXKUI", "B005LAIGRS", "B000EHSVVE", "B00005N5S2", "B00K2CHY1Y", "B000NVT0RU", "B00008R9M6", "B00008J2PG", "B00003CXA6", "B001CU9D2I", "B002ZG97RE", "B005HQBO9I", "B00005OSJQ", "B00008AOTO", "B00JA3RVG4", "B000O599VC", "B004SJVQ4I", "B004P7CMVE", "B0001NBMH6", "B00080ETYA", "B00005R23T", "0385495641", "B00004ZBVG", "B00021R7BM", "B00CLH09UQ", "B004GSVXBW", "B00911L7VA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFXVCU", "B00AEFXRRO", "B00AEBBA36", "B00001ZWUS"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 239439}, "asin": "B000BOH8UA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WY802K3GL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Great Raid (Widescreen Director's Cut)"}

{"description": "Andrew Davies isn't much of household name in the U.S., but he's the king of the BBC mini-series. His skillfully adapted scripts forPride & Prejudice(the beloved Colin Firth version) and many, many more are peerless examples of classic novels done right--cunningly edited and shaped to let all the rich emotion and sharp intelligence spill over with zip and vigor.Bleak Houseis no exception; it's one of the best Dickens adaptations to date. The mini-series form allows Dickens' panoramic view, brimming with eccentric characters and complex turns of plot, to sprawl out without losing an iota of suspense or momentum. Two innocent young  orphans (Patrick Kennedy and Carey Mulligan) are the potential heirs to a fortune, but their fates are snarled in a monumental legal battle known as Jarndyce and Jarndyce. But the heart of the story is another orphan, Esther Summerson (Anna Maxwell Martin), whose mysterious parentage proves to be intertwined with the fate of the Jarndyce wards and the aloof Lady Dedlock (Gillian Anderson,The X-Files). Dickens' story twines through an excoriating vision of the legal system to heartbreaking domestic drama to a murder investigation to near-Gothic horror, all broken into utterly delicious half-hour segments (after the hour-long opening episode). Martin is utterly beguiling, homely at one moment and luminous the next; Anderson's grippingly eerie and brittle performance will delight her fans. But to single out anyone seems absurd, because every character--from the vicious lawyer Tulkinghorn (Charles Dance,White Mischief) to the foppish parasite Skimpole (Nathaniel Parker,The Inspector Lynley Mysteries) to the simpering clerk Guppy (Burn Gorman)--is intricately drawn, all hitting a mesmerizing balance between caricature and stark emotional honesty.Bleak Housedemonstrates that humor, pathos, and social criticism can all be contained in one wonderfully entertaining package.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001PU8N0I", "B0009PVZM8", "B002XTBECY", "B0009PVZIW", "B0031RAP5O", "B000M2E32M", "B000784WNQ", "B0077PBPGO", "B000GIXLUC", "B0009PVZL4", "B000FQIRXQ", "B00005YUNK", "B000AYEL6U", "B00065GVIO", "B0012OVCE6", "B00065GX96", "B00005JOA0", "B000EBD9VC", "B0077PBPVE", "B00140PK6O", "B0000AQS3P", "B004JMSIQS", "B001PU8O5W", "0141439726", "B000Z27HLS", "B00BCXW106", "B003WEAW18", "B00003CXSA", "B00F1BFRA6", "B00009MEJ4", "B00E3UN44W", "B000E0ODZE", "B004XVMCMQ", "B000FQIRY0", "B00003JRCQ", "B004K4FUUC", "B004QOB8SO", "B0083HXKMC", "B005T0OY5S", "B004132HZS", "B00H4ZEFTQ", "B002XTBE6K", "B007A2O3FO", "B000BNTMKK", "B00E3UN66I", "B001PU8MZO", "B000V1OUPE", "B000Z27HMW", "B00062IZ0Y", "B00141188M", "B00DW5IKN4", "B000LPQ6DE", "B00HUAGZ34", "B00BOTCJXC", "B009NRQTGU", "B0031RAP5Y", "0141439963", "B00BIR2A3E", "B003TY2STA", "B00C888LOO", "B0074FUSFG", "B002EWD0I6", "B0093I913W", "B000A8AXXG", "B000089QEM", "B002XTBEDI", "B000FQIRYA", "B000M2E32C", "B0013NAMLK", "B00AATGDUC", "B00B62R9XM", "B00HGE90Z4", "B00G6HO368", "B001GJ4U5A", "B009L2EW5W", "B0080QOL10", "B00J3M54AW", "B00AF82WTO", "B00IKM5OTW", "B000NJL4QC", "B002VWOMZ4", "B003CP1T50", "B00B83OIVA", "B00JJRLFVS", "B00CDZBS7O", "B000E8JNQU", "B001VLBDB2", "B001PU8O4I", "B00DW5ILF6", "B004N66XYE", "B0009PVZK0", "B00FRQ0L2O", "B001H9JBW6", "B00CLB7CFM", "B008UQUS26", "B00GAXASK8", "B00005JKNF", "B004JMSIVI", "B004H0ZHD4", "B00D49YFAA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0031RAP5Y", "B0009PVZIW", "B001PU8N0I", "B0031RAP5O"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 141194}, "asin": "B000CEXG0U", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515XGD7NEZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bleak House"}

{"description": "InGet Rich or Die Tryin', rapper Curtis \"50 Cent\" Jackson presents himself as a rap superhero, encased in muscular flesh like armor, his face impassive as a mask, reaching out to destroy his enemies with his unique talent. The plot, though based on Jackson's life, is standard--a gangster breaks from his youthful life of crime to triumph as a rapper--but there's vitality in the details: Jackson's girlfriend helps him pull free the wires holding his jaw shut when he's recovered from being shot in the face; a startling, brutal fight by naked men in a prison shower. Jackson even has his comic-book moment of transformation when a razor blade is thrown into his cell, encouraging him to kill himself; instead, he uses it to carve his rhymes into the walls. Unfortunately, as an actor Jackson only has two sides, gangster hard or oddly childlike and vulnerable. This second aspect falls away from the movie as Jackson assumes power, leaving only the cold, impassive face of a tough guy. That's the fate of superheroes too--they become the mask they present to the world, which is both their dream and their fate. Terrence Howard (Crash,Hustle & Flow) livens things up as a volatile prison friend. Also featuring Bill Duke (Predator) as a raspy ganglord and Joy Bryant (Honey) as Jackson's girlfriend. Capably directed by Jim Sheridan (My Left Foot,In America).--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001TUZGPO", "B00005JLQE", "B00AEFYAC0", "B000HDZKLO", "B000FS9ULC", "B00003CY51", "B00AEFYE08", "B001TUZI20", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00005JLG1", "B002CA68N4", "B00000JGHV", "B0068FZ0XI", "0767811070", "B004SIP93S", "B0000YEE6M", "B000084T18", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B000063RQO", "B0041QSZS8", "B0019X3YZA", "6305505780", "B00003W8NT", "B0000JBUHI", "B002CA68NO", "B00007ELEN", "B000BITV9W", "B001IX4CKC", "1558908390", "B0007NFL18", "B0002J4YVK", "B0001FR3HW", "B000BEZQ1S", "B00006HAYO", "B002VWNIEA", "B00005JPK8", "B00004Y2R1", "B0001MMGC2", "B000060MWA", "B000C20VRS", "B000A2XAQ4", "B000LRZHR8", "B000035P5I", "B003INBNQQ", "B0041QSZ9M", "0780631234", "B00005U156", "B001DJLD12", "B0000TAZS8", "B00AEFXOKO", "B00AEFYA66", "B00005B8UA", "6305505802", "0767821955", "6304821832", "B000JRYOPG", "B00005UQ9I", "6305428409", "B0002B14UW", "B003VA3JZY", "B00005JND5", "B000XT1P20", "B00008MTYF", "B002CPMB9O", "B00007AJG1", "B00008977B", "B00005JLQT", "B00007ELEO", "B00004RJ71", "B00005JKMQ", "B000069DOB", "B000QUCPUC", "B000KHYN9C", "B000089729", "B00177YFYM", "B00023P4IS", "B003Y5H4ZC", "B00007L4KF", "B0034G4P1C", "B00005ASOO", "B00AEFXTKO", "B0046JLTMY", "B000056BOW", "B00ANDDBBY", "630592273X", "0792838076", "B000WM84Y0", "B001132GNY", "B00AMEZDJW", "B0006H32DO", "B004499NII", "B004P7CMZ0", "B0089BSLYO", "B00E1HIX66", "B00005RIX5", "B000K7UC2Y", "B002VWNICM", "B001AK3S4O", "B00066FAC6", "B0002B14UC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JLQE", "B001TUZGPO", "B00AEFYAC0", "B0068FZ0XI"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 331614}, "asin": "B000E0LLKO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SV3RRD66L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Get Rich Or Die Tryin' [DVD]"}

Having risen from obscurity to make his fortune, Summer pines for just one thing: Sky (Chenoa Maxwell), the woman who dumped him back in college to marry the brutal, philandering Chip (Blair Underwood). Sky's feckless cousin, Tre (Andre Royer), a pop journalist, sets her up in an assignation with Summer, leading to predictable conflicts but with unexpected consequences. Co-written and directed by Christopher Scott Cherot,G.is also an interesting portrait of American wealth, particularly the collision of old and new money in the form of a biracial aristocracy coming to terms with a hip-hop elite.

{"description": "The radiant glow of Keeley Hawes--an English rose if ever there was one--anchorsUnder the Greenwood Tree, a light romance from the normally gloomy pen of Thomas Hardy (The Mayor of Casterbridge,Tess of the d'Urbervilles). When a young educated woman with the preposterous name of Fancy Day (Hawes,Tipping the Velvet) returns to a small village to care for her father, she finds herself pursued by three very different men: The poor but handsome Dick Dewy (James Murray,Sons and Lovers), the crude but wealthy Mr. Shiner (Steve Pemberton,The League of Gentlemen), and the erudite but pompous Parson Maybold (Ben Miles,Coupling). The story is slender but enjoyable, with hints of class conflict and the changes due to come from the impending Industrial Revolution. Hawes lends her considerable intelligence and charm to the put-upon Miss Day; she makes you feel the eroticism of washing your hands in the same basin with an attractive man.

While Lieutenant Fancy continues as precinct commander, Detective Andy Sipowicz, although still a bit rough around the edges, has mellowed with the birth of his son.   Detective Bobby Simone and Detective Diane Russell take the next step in their relationship, James Martinez becomes the Squad Delegate, and Greg Meadavoy considers becoming a surrogate father. But one thing that hasn't changed is the squad's determination to make sure the bad guys get their day in court and to also attempt to maintain a touch of normalcy in their personal lives even as they investigate cases that often put them directly in the line of fire.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BZISRG", "B00188XHFI", "B00FM4S8H6", "B00188XHF8", "B00ITAQ2T6", "B00KTFJ6J2", "B000EHSVC8", "B000BOH8YG", "B00GSTHCHQ", "B00K6LWNQW", "B00IRIMGTA", "B00008PHCZ", "B00080Z5FM", "B00GHH9HUE", "B001F7Q4JS", "B00CYQXE10", "B0001K5GOO", "B00EJGMH7U", "B00HRUQA6O", "B000MCH5AO", "B0024FADA6", "B002BWQ4C8", "B000GPPNO2", "B00018YCJ6", "B00I87U9H6", "B0037XPP8Y", "B009CSVRNU", "B0006GAO36", "B002UOMGWO", "B001JAHQP2", "B00AJXO56I", "B00I87U8UE", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B008HUSFXO", "B0012CJQZA", "B0002DRE72", "B0007XG4GE", "B007I1Q54O", "B0055SNHQG", "B0012CJQY6", "B00GTZWU7G", "B00AB55C1Q", "B00915G6Q2", "B001JAHQ1Q", "B0024FAD92", "B0002CX22E", "B00CYQXGAY", "B0002NY830", "B000BGR1AK", "B00F4CIPRE", "B00466H37M", "B001JAHQ16", "B000AQ68U0", "B0012CJQZ0", "B001JAHQ1G", "B0015TX2LO", "B00HNGC516", "B0020TS5EM", "B000BF0C8E", "B00020H9NO", "B000IONJP6", "B008Y1YK9E", "B000LE178Y", "B001JAHQ0W", "B00J5LXT44", "B001UXTIZE", "B00I86MQF0", "B001JFKWE4", "B002N5N5OI", "B00KTFJ7UA", "B002BLNGTS", "B000N2HD6O", "B000BGR1B4", "B0002CX21K", "B00GM1X2RO", "B00ESK1PES", "B0094UOI64", "B0012CJQYG", "B000B8I9ZO", "B001L1S1OO", "B00GM1X2JM", "B000LXGXY8", "B00CYQXATG", "B000XJD3K2", "B00064VQXA", "B001LXIDWC", "B0015XHR5C", "B0000AVHCD", "B00061QJYE", "B0000C5RPV", "B003R0MF62", "B009VXVMAO", "B00915G6OE", "B000A7DW7Q", "B003R0MF08", "B00466H37W", "B000E8JO2S", "B005FQ2HBO", "B003UD7JC6"], "bought_together": ["B000BZISRG", "B00FM4S8H6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00FM4S8H6", "B00ITAQ2T6", "B00144K5LK", "B00GSTHCHQ"]}, "price": 20.44, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 33858}, "asin": "B000EXDS0C", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61BCSDPGKSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "NYPD Blue - The Complete Fourth Season"}

{"description": "Forget any off-screen impressions you may have of Mel Gibson, and experience Apocalypto as the mad, bloody runaway train that it is. The story is set in the pre-Columbian Maya population: one village is brutally overrun, its residents either slaughtered or abducted, by a ruling tribe that needs slaves and human sacrifices. We focus on the capable warrior Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), although Gibson skillfully sketches a whole population of characters--many of whom don't survive the early reels. Most of the film is set in the dense jungle, but the middle section, in a grand Mayan city, is a dazzling triumph of design, costuming, and sheer decadent terror. The movie itself is a triumph of brutality, as Gibson lets loose his well-established fascination with bodily mortification in a litany of assaults including impalement, evisceration, snakebite, and bee stings. It's a dark, disgusted vision, but Gibson doesn't forget to apply some very canny moviemaking instincts to the violence--including the creation of a tremendous pair of villains (strikingly played by Raoul Trujillo and Rodolfo Palacias). The film is in a Maya dialect, subtitled in English, and shot on digital video (which occasionally betrays itself in some blurry quick pans). Amidst all the mayhem, nothing in the film is more devastating than a final wordless exchange of looks between captured villager Blunted (Jonathan Brewer) and his wife's mother (Maria Isabel Diaz), a superb change in tone from their early relationship. Yes, this is an obsessive, crazed movie, but Gibson knows what he's doing. --Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000UVV24M", "B0012Q732O", "B00003CXAF", "B001BNFRB2", "B000VMIILU", "1573623903", "B002O3Z50Q", "B00004XPPG", "6305692688", "B00028HBKM", "B00004RJ71", "B00AEFXKUI", "B002ZG999U", "B0002YLCG0", "B000VKL6ZM", "B002T9H2LA", "B0000542C6", "B0001CNQX0", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00006ADD5", "B00406UK7S", "B004AOECXI", "B004SIP8W0", "B000R9U3B0", "B00008G8LY", "B00001ZWUS", "B000MGB6NM", "B003EYVXXW", "6304711905", "B004HO6HWA", "B000QXDED6", "B0034G4P58", "B0000714BS", "B000XR9L50", "B00005JLQT", "0783230389", "B002VWNIEA", "B00AZNEW5G", "B008MIMWQW", "B003VA3JZY", "B0002DRDIW", "B000AARKOO", "B00BEJL6JK", "B004SIP7TE", "079283366X", "B00005V9HH", "B000M341QE", "B003HKN52U", "B005IUIXCE", "B00275EGWY", "B003UYUQZW", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002O3Z510", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B002WY65VU", "B000I0RNWU", "B00003CXWV", "B002XMGGK6", "B003NF97NK", "B000QXDCJ2", "B001FB5634", "B001DZOC6Y", "B007STBUHI", "B0000VCZMK", "B0013FDM7E", "B00015YVDG", "B003IY498Y", "6305433925", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005K3NR", "B000O76ZQC", "B003ELKNH2", "B00018D3ZA", "6304821832", "B00AEBBA36", "B009YQJ322", "B00005JL3T", "079284646X", "B002CA68MU", "B00BTYJYR6", "B00AEFYE08", "B000P0J09C", "B005LAIHPE", "B00441GZ1Y", "B001OQCV2E", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000BITV9W", "B004LWZW4M", "B005LAIIRQ", "B00003CXBH", "B000A2WP7O", "B001GCUO0W", "B00005JPD0", "B00AMSLDTM", "B000RTB0R6", "B00005JA8B", "B00009PY4G", "0783226039", "B000B8QG22", "B000069I1I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001BNFRB2", "B00028HBKM", "B00001ZWUS", "B00004XPPG"]}, "price": 10.55, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 53938}, "asin": "B000GNOKQG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41yXQu76-NL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Apocalypto (2006) (2007) Rudy Youngblood; Raoul Trujillo; Mel Gibson"}

{"description": "The envelope-pushing cartoons created by Robert Smigel for \"Saturday TV Funhouse\" onSaturday Night Liveare tasteless, crass, borderline offensive, and almost universally hilarious. This disc collects two dozen of the best, and viewing them together makes for a deliciously warped vision of Smigel and a relentlessly silly prism through which to view American pop culture. Case in point: The action-adventure heroes Ace and Gary, \"The Ambiguously Gay Duo\" (voiced, with deadpan earnestness, by Steve Carell and Stephen Colbert), are actually pretty unambiguous, but the joke is played just straight enough--while fighting to save the earth, they always allocate time to accessorize--and to pat one another on the bum for a job well done. In \"Bambi 2002,\" Disney is roasted for its policy of pulling choice children's titles from the marketplace and releasing instead direct-to-video sequels that may not be up to the level of the original. In the \"sequel,\" Bambi's mom is OK (\"it was just a head wound, son\"), and Bambi and his forest posse are hip-hop kids fighting terrorists in their spare time. \"Remember, kids,\" the TV announcer intones, \"it's all the Bambi you'll get for 10 years.\" Other highlights include the cartoon beauty contest \"Are You Hot?\" (in which Strawberry Shortcake beats out Betty Boop for sex appeal), and the black-and-white industrial training film \"Sexual Harassment and You,\" which advises employees on the three rules for trysting with a co-worker while avoiding a sexual harassment lawsuit: 1. Be Handsome. 2. Be Attractive. and 3. Don't be unattractive. Elsewhere, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush are skewered by their own words, and Michael Jackson reappears as a Hanna-Barbera creation--and still manages to be creepy. Extras include commentaries by Smigel, Carell, Colbert, Al Franken, James Carville, and others, as well as extra cartoon snippets and original art and storyboards.--A.T.

{"description": "Accept no substitutes. The 1966 television adaptation of Dr. Seuss' timeless bookHow the Grinch Stole Christmas!--about an anti-Santa who tries to heist the holiday only to learn a powerful lesson--is a classic in its own right, and looking better than ever in its 50th Birthday Deluxe Edition. (For those doing the math, the 50 years is counting from the book's 1957 publishing date rather than the show's broadcast date.) The most significant improvement is in the digital transfer, cleaning up fuzz and specks and restoring the proper colors to the program. While the awful earlier DVDs showed the Grinch in a mustard-yellow color, this edition restores his proper green gleam.  Special features are mostly ported over from the previous DVD--theHorton Hears a Whoprogram, a featurette on the songs, Phil Hartman's special edition version, pencil tests, etc. minus the commentary track--but there is a new 15-minute featurette, \"Dr. Seuss and the Grinch: From Whoville to Hollywood.\" While it starts out as a fluff piece aimed at the younger set (interviews with kids, some rapping), it does provide some interesting information, including interviews with the widows of Theodore Geisel and Chuck Jones and clips of Geisel and Jones'Private Snafu. (No mention of Jim Carrey, however.)--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001CO42J8", "B0057FGCJQ", "B003P3PQOO", "B000S0PLGA", "B003P3PQMQ", "B000HT3PPG", "B000HEWEJO", "B000VBIGCW", "B001CO32FI", "B00005LOUP", "B000R7G6KO", "B000ATQYT2", "B002MU4NN6", "B000AGTPUK", "0394800796", "B000068TR1", "B000VBIGD6", "B000VAHQVU", "B003U0AHG4", "B0002F6BRE", "B0006419KA", "B001CO32FS", "B00008N6NQ", "B008UY8FI2", "B00004TS0E", "B000R7G6JU", "B000I0QL82", "B005QODEEE", "B003NFM3JK", "B000R7G6KY", "B00005N7Z0", "B00DGWZK0Y", "6305609764", "B001CW8016", "6305950547", "B001CO42IO", "B000R7G6JA", "B002LMV7TS", "B005BYBZPY", "B001NPDO90", "B00AATV046", "B000641D2Y", "B008Y1YKE4", "B001DPHDBA", "0780623746", "B0000AQS5D", "B001DDBD5E", "B000B5XOZC", "B000B5XOZ2", "B000HT3PLK", "B000TJBN6W", "B00008X5J7", "B002WZUNX0", "B0007A0F4E", "B002K2KMMW", "B001CTA1UM", "B008JFUQ16", "0395389496", "B0002M5U7E", "B00009WHRM", "B0019KAQEU", "B000YABV7W", "B001CW7ZZ8", "B004047XWU", "B002GSXKQU", "B00DS79HCE", "B00006JU8F", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B005BXY1QK", "B001E5CH0G", "B008JFUQ3O", "B000UX798I", "B0042U94UQ", "B00DNF1S0K", "B00E9ZATJO", "B00447L4JG", "B00G5G7K7O", "B0029ZUQB2", "B00006RJAK", "B00F6SHECS", "B000S6LP5A", "B002VA5A0M", "B000OLGCIE", "B002WJI2QQ", "B00F522C7C", "B000MQC9H4", "B00EV1YZ96", "B0002M5U6A", "B005AU4SBC", "B0010DM4EG", "B000Q7ZO8U", "B00006JZI2", "B0002I82Z0", "B005G3VCYY", "B000001EHA", "B00E0JNMJS", "B003YCIE68", "B00DS79H9C", "B005F96UJ6"], "bought_together": ["B001CO42J8", "B0057FGCJQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005LOUP", "B00004VVP9", "B001CO32FI", "B0057FGCJQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 145807}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.98, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000HA4WDY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519EInwSYiL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas!

{"description": "Thai-born martial artist Tony Jaa, whose gravity-defying stunts wowed American audiences inOng-Bak: The Thai Warrior, returns in an equally eye-popping stunt fest that should thrill all but the most jaded action fans. The very simple plot has the soft-spoken, mild-mannered Jaa as a young man from a rural community dispatched to Australia to recover a pair of sacred elephants. Once there, he discovered that a female crime boss (played by transgendered actor Jing Xing) is behind the missing pachyderms, and Jaa pulls out all the stops to recover the animals for his village. As inOng-Bak, the appeal ofThe Protectoris watching Jaa unleash his muay thai skills on a host of villainous types, and he gets several astonishing showcases in this film, most notably a nearly-unbroken take in which he dispatches some 50 goons as he makes his way up a four-story structure. Those looking for the depth of story or character found in the best of Hong Kong action cinema won't find it inThe Protector, but the rewards for action fans are plentiful and thoroughly entertaining. The two-disc Collector's Edition ofThe Protectorincludes a wealth of extras, most notably the original Thai version of the film (titledTom Yum Goong), which runs approximately 30 minutes longer than the American version. Commentary by martial arts writer and fan Bey Logan is featured on the American edit, along with a deleted scene, a featurette about Jaa with Logan and rapper/producer The RZA (who scored the American version and, for some reason, is described as a major force in bringing Asian entertainment to the States), making-of featurettes on both the English and Thai versions of the film (the latter features a subtitled Thai-language commentary track with Jaa, director Prachya Pinkaew, and stunt coordinator/mentor Panna Rittikrai), and three fair short films that were produced for a promotional tie-in contest.-- Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009VBTQY", "B002XTXGA2", "B004BZ5ADW", "B00JVQ7RCS", "B002DHACS8", "B005ZMBEXU", "B001L67A4G", "B003INBNXO", "B004326EV0", "B0085A9J18", "B004I1AGTC", "B000GFLKDU", "B003FXXNH6", "B003EVAG4C", "B000K7UC2Y", "B004U7MR0K", "B000ICLU7C", "B004H2CXBQ", "B004P8R9O8", "B00ATXIJOC", "B000K2UW06", "B003LN0NXC", "B001MEJY9G", "B0035V35P8", "B0016MJ6JC", "B000N4SHNK", "B005F96UGO", "B00HSJ2EMI", "B00GXFZOYI", "B004XQO8MS", "B004SIP88Y", "B002C6VMIY", "B00J5LXST0", "B003DVB7F0", "B000A2IPQY", "B00B6OEE7O", "B006C1S1DY", "B002FU8JTW", "B0018PH3NS", "B00284G2BC", "B004U7MR1O", "B000MM0LEG", "B000V6I7N0", "B005E7SEZW", "B004GJYRKA", "B00FLCYIAA", "B001EI5C5U", "B009VL2A5M", "B001U0HB5Q", "B0054EKDEU", "B000HC2M3Y", "B00AWHDEIQ", "B0030A6ICG", "B00ET2ODYY", "B001MEJY9Q", "B00JVQ7PS4", "B000UVV2AG", "B004VW4V9E", "B00005YUNV", "B00ENTX7JU", "B00008EY6M", "B00J5LXTUI", "B0056OZI0M", "B005F96UHI", "B004SIPAP0", "B0085A9HXS", "B00C3ALL9O", "B006JD48GY", "B0019F02U8", "B00369ERCY", "B000K2V7DW", "B000EE3FUY", "B005KK2FWG", "B004TFTE9A", "B00003CXR4", "B00G3HOJZ6", "B002XTBE5Q", "B0009S2T0M", "B003YOZNFQ", "B003M9ZABU", "B000FKO5QK", "B0010X740K", "B00EI3Y1QO", "B0051SFTGQ", "B001QB9H1U", "B00FEHCQEC", "B00005OOQ1", "B000MM0LE6", "B000P6R9N0", "B008XEZXES", "B001BEK8HO", "B00003CY5A", "B000QGEB12", "0767819640", "B00HI9QGWC", "B0013D8LCM", "B0010X741O", "B0019PL2W0"], "bought_together": ["B002XTXGA2", "B0009VBTQY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0085A9J18", "B00J5LXST0", "3918810143", "B004I1AGTC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15313}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.1, "brand": "Weinstein Company", "asin": "B000I0RNWU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YIZWM7HuL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Protector (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "The wisecracks, hugs, and late-night servings of cheesecake continue in the sixth season ofThe Golden Girls. At the end of the sitcom's previous year, Blanche's daughter, Becky (Debra Engle), announced her pregnancy. In the sixth, Blanche (Rue McClanahan) becomes a grandmother (\"Blanche Delivers\"). Other developments: Dorothy (Beatrice Arthur) starts seeing ex-husband Stan (Herb Edelman), Sophia (Estelle Getty) dons a habit, and Rose (Betty White) discovers the true identity of Miles (Harold Gould). AsThe Golden Girlsmoves on into the 1990s, the earrings--and Dorothy's shoulder pads--remain as out-sized as ever, but the show takes on more contemporary issues, like cross-dressing (\"Ebbtide's Revenge\") and sexual orientation (\"Sisters of the Bride\"). Despite the bevy of put-downs, the message is one of tolerance--for anyone who exists outside the norm. There are also a few surprises, such as the appearance of Rose's birth father (\"Once, in St. Olaf\"), Dorothy's engagement (\"There Goes the Bride\"), and the secret relationship between Blanche's nanny (Ruby Dee) and her late father, Big Daddy (\"Wham, Bam, Thank You, Mammy\").As before, everyone wanted to drop by NBC's Saturday staple, like Martin Mull (\"Snap Out of It\"), Sonny Bono (\"Mrs. George Devereaux\"), Cesar Romero (\"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun... Before They Die\"), Debbie Reynolds (\"There Goes the Bride\"), Alan King (\"Melodrama\"), and Hal Linden (\"What a Difference a Date Makes\"). The behind-the-scenes talent shines just as brightly in co-executive producer Tom Whedon (father ofBuffy the Vampire Slayer's Joss Whedon) and story editors Marc Cherry (Desperate Housewives) and Mitchell Hurwitz (Arrested Development). Although there are no commentaries this time around, the set includes an insightful chat with McClanahan, White, Cherry, Hurwitz, and others from a Museum of Television and Radio tribute. One of the more notable insights: \"To this day... 70% of our mail comes from people under 25 years old.\"--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Cunningly fusing father-son sentiment and more blows to the groin per minute than any other movie you'll see this (and possibly any other) year,Little Manaims to win the heart of any man who's ever wished his son was actually a foul-mouthed, jewel-thieving midget. The rubbery face of Marlon Wayans (White Chicks) is digitally transposed onto the body of an actual midget so that Marlon can play Calvin, a bad-tempered thief who's trying to retrieve a humongous diamond from the purse of Vanessa (Kerry Washington,Ray), the buppie wife of Darryl (Shawn Wayans,Scary Movie 2). Darryl doesn't care about his wife's new promotion, he just wants to have a child--and he gets one when Calvin arrives on his doorstep dressed in baby clothes. At which point, the kicks, head-butts, and blunt object trauma to the groin begin. It's beside the point to argue whether or not this is definitively funny; blows to the groin either make you laugh or they don't, and if they do, you know who you are and you should seek this movie out. It will give you all you could possibly ask for, including numerous jokes about bodily functions and breasts. Also featuring John Witherspoon (Friday), Tracy Morgan (Saturday Night Live), Chazz Palminteri (Bullets Over Broadway), and cameos by Molly Shannon (Superstar) and Rob Schneider (Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo). --Bret FetzerStills fromLittle Man(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFYQWO", "B0002VYOVI", "B0002B14UW", "B0014QLEI6", "B004FPE43K", "B000RBA6C4", "B00177YFYM", "B000803BQC", "B0034G4P1C", "B00008K7AM", "B00BLN4V46", "B004P7CMZ0", "B0007N1A36", "B004WJT5E2", "B00124ONGA", "6305505780", "B000ZBEOEC", "B00003CY51", "B00005JM4W", "B000YAF4Q6", "6304821832", "B000R5OFNG", "B00JPFTW1E", "B002GSXKOM", "B000FOQ1KY", "B00AEFXY6I", "B004SIP8YI", "B00AZMFINM", "B00003CXPS", "B00006LPH6", "B002AT4JOM", "B001DJLD12", "B000BFH2C8", "B002GSXKO2", "B00007BK2S", "B000BTITFI", "B001JV5AZE", "B00005JND5", "B000FS9ULC", "B004BZ5AJG", "B004SIP9E2", "B00008WI9O", "B00CAATSME", "B001QUF7DS", "B002CAWNEM", "B00005B8UA", "B000095J01", "B0009RCPUW", "B00005JN4H", "B000VXWX7E", "B00000JGHV", "0767813901", "B00HX0KIAM", "1558908390", "B00005IBN0", "B000069DOB", "B00AG472HY", "B003Y5H56K", "B0000AGQ6T", "B003Y5H58S", "B000MTFFO0", "B001690X6A", "B0014BQR7Y", "B0009DWL8W", "B001KKU9DM", "B00005JLQT", "B00HW3EI3I", "B00003CXNG", "B000BUE5E6", "B000HT386M", "B0006QAIG4", "B0050OWMKW", "B000PE0GRI", "B0001MMGC2", "B001GKJ2E8", "6305428409", "0783237367", "B00000K3UU", "B00003CY1Y", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B0000TWMTS", "B0002J4YVK", "B00008977B", "B0006GAI5U", "0780627822", "B000228EHM", "B00006JDVT", "B0001FR3HW", "B0021L8UYY", "B0000ZMH1A", "B008PENF1O", "B004SIP9I8", "B000060MWA", "B00066FAQW", "B008Y1YJN6", "B002CA68NO", "B000063RQO", "B00005UQ9A", "B00E1HIXA2"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFYQWO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFYQWO", "B0009RCPUW", "B0002VYOVI", "B0007N1A36"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 38060}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.19, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000IFRT4W", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QiGsadF6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Little Man (Widescreen)"}

{"description": "A moving and inspiring story of redemption and personal triumph in the face of great odds,Jet Li's Fearlessis the based-on-facts story of Chinese folk hero Huo Yuanjia (Jet Li). The son of a martial-arts master whose greatest strength was his restraint, Huo grows into an unbeatable fighter whose pride and thoughtlessness lead to a chain of tragic losses. After a classic wanderer-in-the-wilderness penance, Huo reinvents himself as a mature instructor of Wushu, a martial arts system that embraces all forms of fighting without preference or pre-judgement. He also becomes a populist symbol, at the dawn of the 20th century, of China's refusal to entirely capitulate to the boot of Western colonialists. Taking on whatever European, American, or Japanese fighter the outsiders bring in to demoralize the natives, Huo becomes a legend that, in real life, is still revered. Thrillingly directed by Ronny Yu (Warriors of Virtue),Jet Li&#x92;s Fearlessis a dazzling action movie that transcends its breathless fight sequences with Huo's sportsmanship virtues, i.e., knowing when you've won by example, rather than by the fist. Jet Li is superb in the role.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SIP88Y", "B000A2IPQY", "B003EVAG4C", "B0016MJ6JC", "B004U7MR0K", "B003INBNXO", "B0007Q6VXC", "B00003CXR4", "B001MEJY9Q", "B00008EY6M", "B001BEK8HO", "B00003CY5A", "B004I1AGTC", "B0009VBTQY", "B00005V1WW", "B005KK2FWG", "B004U7MR1O", "B000X1Z0C4", "B005FQ1OOK", "B000MRA592", "B000I0RNWU", "B005ZMBEXU", "B003DVB7F0", "B004P8R9O8", "B002XTXGA2", "B000JYW5BO", "B0030A6ICG", "B004GJYRKA", "B00005OOQ1", "B000MM0LEG", "B00HSJ2EMI", "B0051SFTGQ", "B002C6VMIY", "B008IG0B0C", "B000QGEB12", "B00005YUNV", "B001MEJY9G", "B000EE3FUY", "B00K2LC44M", "B004VW4V9E", "B004BZ5ADW", "B004XQO8MS", "B000GFLKDU", "B000ICLU7C", "B009VL2AZM", "B006C1S1DY", "B001L67A4G", "B00B6OEE7O", "B00284G2BC", "B00ET2ODYY", "B005E7SEZW", "B00104AYGK", "B00518HBAI", "B0055CP9EK", "B000W95QDK", "B00C3ALL9O", "0780619331", "B00FLCYIAA", "B009VL2A5M", "B006LOC01G", "B00518HB94", "B0000694WE", "B0015RCUR8", "B00EI3Y1QO", "B004I7F862", "B003E1QCYK", "B005NQ5LQ4", "B006MWA91A", "B001H5X6PI", "B000683VH0", "0783226985", "B00GXFZOYI", "B0056OZI0W", "B000050B7J", "B0035V35P8", "B0019PL2W0", "B00003CXGG", "B000HC2M3Y", "B008XEZXES", "B00441GYWO", "B0002O7XUE", "B000I2KOB0", "B0015RCUQO", "B0085A9J18", "B004SUDQAY", "B00005JMEW", "B005F96UGO", "B0010X741O", "B004H2CXBQ", "B00005JMUA", "B003LN0NXC", "B0060KGSGO", "B0018PH3NS", "B0056OZI0M", "B008WAM36O", "B005M9VSMI", "B00B1CGFD2", "B000FELD8Y", "B00005BJX9"], "bought_together": ["B004SIP88Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004GXKBGK", "B003INBNXO", "B004SIP88Y", "B001BEK8HO"]}, "price": 10.28, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 107058}, "asin": "B000K2UW06", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51qxHWcGBlL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jet Li's Fearless (Unrated Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "What Agatha Christie did for genteel spinsters with her intrepid crime-solver Miss Marple, G.K. Chesterton did with the splendid Father Brown, a bumbling yet wily cleric in 1920s England, bumping into and then solving the most outlandish crimes. This boxed set includes seven full-length episodes ofFather Brown(shown in the U.S. on PBS) in all his twinkly, slightly clueless glory.The Curse of the Golden Crossis a particular gem, ambitious in its story of an American archeologist who receives eerie death threats from a hidden competitor (or is it a ghost?) upon his discovery of an important ancient cross. As the archeologist returns to England to view what is reportedly a second, heretofore unknown cross, dug up at a country church, an upper crust entourage gathers 'round him--and Father Brown, of course--as he makes his way to the site. \"A curse! How splendid!\" says one aging flapper upon learning that the newest find may have crossed the gods in an irrevocable way. Despite the varying production values (the show switches from film for outdoor shots to video for indoors), the intricate plots (mistaken identities, hidden adultery, faked suicides) make for a very satisfying armchair detective experience.

{"description": "Eugene Barkley, we hardly knew ye. The youngest of the Barkley sons (quick--who portrayed him? That's right; Charles Briles) is nowhere to be found inThe Big Valley's sophomore season. But lawyer Jarrod (Richard Long), hot-headed Nick (Peter Breck), soulful \"bastard son\" Heath (Lee Majors), and coltish daughter Audra (Linda Evans) get into all the trouble and two-fisted action they can handle. And there's nothing the close-knit Barkleys, headed by matriarch Victoria (regally billed as \"Miss Barbara Stanwyck\") can't handle, whether it's defending the family name against the false accusations of an unscrupulous, grudge-bearing politician, rescuing Heath from a Mexican prison, or being abandoned in the desert. The drama of Heath's heritage, a focus of season 1, is settled once and for all in the season opener, \"The Lost Treasure,\" in which a con man claims to be Heath's father. By episode's end, even Nick is calling Heath \"brother.\"Season 2 boasts an impressive roster of character actors, several at the beginning of their careers. Buddy Hackett, sporting a Lucky Charms leprechaun brogue, is the con man in \"The Lost Treasure,\" with Bruce Dern as one of his marks, and Dub Taylor tending a ghost town bar. Colleen Dewhurst guest stars in the episode \"A Day of Terror, as outlaw Annie Morton, who holds Victoria and Audra hostage while her injured son recuperates in a church. James Whitmore is the mud-slinging candidate in \"Target.\" Warren Oates heads a band of bumbling brothers trying to open a stubborn railroad station safe in \"The Great Safe Robbery.\" And that's the future Jan Brady, Eve Plumb as a little girl trapped in a well in \"Hide the Children,\" an excellent episode that deals with intolerance as gypsy-hating Nick gets a change of attitude when he accompanies a gypsy bride and her family to her wedding.The Big Valleywas never a ratings rival to the venerableGunsmokeorBonanza, which still ruled the prime time roost in 1966. But Western buffs will feel right at home with this sprawling family saga and its larger than life characters. Buyers, though, will be paying a higher premium for the Barkley property this time around.  Priced the same as the season 1 set, this collection contains only the first 15 episodes of season 2 and no extra features.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EHSVB4", "B00JEZWRE4", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B0002W4TVM", "B001JAHPMG", "B006ZL1P84", "B005D7E7Y0", "B000PHX5KU", "B007V973KI", "B00KB01N4G", "B000EOR0BY", "B004HHX9T6", "B001NRPQK8", "B00IP965IO", "B008BT98LO", "B008KZX766", "B00A73ANHA", "B00A92MBIS", "B00CD45JDE", "B00KB01OG8", "B000NOIX7U", "B00C81AWAM", "B0064CT90U", "B000NY1EAI", "B000H7JCHI", "B006OS1BCI", "B007AAF3FK", "B000F9T70K", "B005LVIOYM", "B00E1HIX2A", "B00CL151ZU", "B000EQ46H8", "B004L5GY82", "B00CL151P0", "B00KTZALDC", "B0013LRKVM", "B00A4F5A60", "B000W8OM68", "B001E6JC1W", "B005LVIP1E", "B00B00HUC0", "B001TWT0CW", "B002OID4T0", "B007MMIMSQ", "B000VS6R3A", "B00IS6WQ2S", "B003XEKXYI", "B00668IFWA", "B003VKVTL0", "B00AWWX7X8", "B0044RFTDI", "B005D7E7PY", "B000TQZBNQ", "B00A6SZRT0", "B005PTYPK2", "B009DA74DY", "B001E6HUXO", "B0007MANZS", "B000BITUYI", "B002FG9N4Q", "B0046S8MRU", "B00BAXTY9O", "B008OIQZ36", "B0083TUEDS", "B0038P1D5K", "B00H7BJ1I2", "B00H7BJ0WO", "B00KW02JW0", "B009OE2NZI", "B009OE2NS0", "B00BAXTYGW", "B002C07AU4", "B008F283Y0", "B0057IY55Q", "B00E96AWY0", "B000BITUZC", "B006OS1B0A", "B003RHZ666", "B00BLN4V2I", "B00I1GUS0C", "B004T0XYLE", "B0025Y3SZS", "B00J9BZ4KC", "B005UFUU6E", "B0026NC61A", "B0013LRKY4", "B00DOZNIVG", "B0001NBND4", "B005LFQRTC", "B00IU6HPIQ", "B00BXTDVEO", "B00BLN4UVU", "B006W95BWA", "B00F6D62O4", "B00AX5B0RY", "B005HMHPHC", "B00E96AY20", "B00AA8Q0JM", "B0007PALOI", "B009ERK2UI"], "bought_together": ["B000EHSVB4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HQLZCIQ", "B000EHSVB4", "B00JEZWRE4", "B00GHH9HW2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 70732}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 11.2, "brand": "20TH Century Fox", "asin": "B000K7VHOQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51bxInX2tGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Big Valley - Season 2, Volume 1"}

{"description": "Martin Scorsese makes a welcome return to the mean streets (of Boston, in this case) withThe Departed, hailed by many as Scorsese's best film sinceCasino. Since this crackling crime thriller is essentially a Scorsese-stamped remake of the acclaimed 2002 Hong Kong thrillerInfernal Affairs, the film was intensely scrutinized by devoted critics and cinephiles, and while Scorsese's intense filmmaking and all-star cast deserve ample acclaim,The Departedis also worthy of serious re-assessment, especially with regard to what some attentive viewers described as sloppy craftsmanship (!), notably in terms of mismatched shots and jagged continuity. But no matter where you fall on the Scorsese appreciation scale, there's no denying thatThe Departedis a signature piece of work from one of America's finest directors, designed for maximum impact with a breathtaking series of twists, turns, and violent surprises. It's an intricate cat-and-mouse game, but this time the cat and mouse are both moles: Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is an ambitious cop on the rise, planted in the Boston police force by criminal kingpin Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a hot-tempered police cadet who's been artificially disgraced and then planted into Costello's crime operation as a seemingly trustworthy soldier. As the multilayered plot unfolds (courtesy of a scorching adaptation byKingdom of Heavenscreenwriter William Monahan), Costigan and Sullivan conduct a volatile search for each other (they're essentially looking for \"themselves\") while simultaneously wooing the psychiatrist (Vera Farmiga) assigned to treat their crime-driven anxieties.Such convenient coincidences might sink a lesser film, butThe Departedis so electrifying that you barely notice the plot-holes. And while Nicholson's profane swagger is too much \"Jack\" and not enough \"Costello,\" he's still a joy to watch, especially in a film that's additionally energized by memorable (and frequently hilarious) supporting roles for Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg, and a host of other big-name performers.The Departedalso makes clever and plot-dependent use of cell-phones, to the extent that it couldn't exist without them. Powered by Scorsese's trademark use of well-chosen soundtrack songs (from vintage rock to Puccini's operas),The Departedmay not be perfect, but it's one helluva ride for moviegoers, proving popular enough to become the biggest box-office hit of Scorsese's commercially rocky career.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002ZG99N6", "B000P0J09M", "B004SIP7TE", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002ZG980U", "B002VWNIEA", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEBB8NI", "B002T9H2LA", "B00005JLSB", "B000MZHW40", "B00080ZG10", "B003ASLJQS", "B000P0J0AG", "B000P0J0EW", "B000C20VPA", "B003UESJHO", "B004SIP7ZS", "B003ASLJO0", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AHTYI5M", "B00275EGWY", "B000XR9L50", "B000A3XY5A", "B0007DFJ0G", "B001N44BVQ", "B00003CXWV", "B008MILL8W", "B000286RP2", "B004SIP7VM", "B00005V9HH", "6305313687", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004FQX5B6", "B00AEFXKUI", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEBB86A", "B005LAIIJY", "B0016Q2D66", "B003ASLJQI", "B00008975Z", "B000IY04Q8", "B001P9KR8U", "B00005JNJV", "B000C20VRS", "B008R65XYC", "B005LAIGRS", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00008DP4C", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00005JN0W", "B005LAIGLE", "B000A2UBN4", "B002QEHPQU", "B000P0J0EM", "B003UESJH4", "B007D5E7C2", "6304765258", "B000P0J0D8", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00004WG2F", "0767830555", "B000LC55F2", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B004EPYZP8", "B000A7DVR2", "B00005JPD0", "B000WZEZGI", "B00049QQHI", "B000FS9FCG", "B00004XPPB", "B006OFN0SE", "B009AMAL4Y", "B004U7MR14", "B000GFLKF8", "B003AWRMCE", "B0019L770A", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B0000AM6JI", "B004SIP9Z6", "B001GZ6QC4", "0783240295", "B0010DR4BO", "B000065U1N", "B00001ZWUS", "B00BB67UNW", "B0000B1OFL", "B00AEBB9K0", "B00DHDDE32", "B00005JKWX", "B0051MKNV8", "B002ZG97RE", "0767802519", "B0034G4P94", "B00DHHWXYY", "B00005B6JZ", "B00003CXZ4", "B001TODCII"], "bought_together": ["B000P0J09M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000RETOHY", "B000P0J09M", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEBB8NI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5067}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.5, "brand": "Warner Bros", "asin": "B000M341QE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RZnzpL34L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Annette Bening is the stand-out highlight in this dysfunctional \"family\" comedy based on the bestselling memoir by Augusten Burroughs. Although fans of the book may be slightly disappointed with the film's uneven and somewhat campy rendition of Burroughs' twisted adolescence in the 1970s, there's plenty of pleasure to be found in the work of an excellent cast led by Bening, who gives a subtle dare-to-hate-me performance as Burroughs' mother Diedre, a would-be poet who's so aloof about her teenage son Augusten (played by fresh-faced newcomer Joseph Cross, fromFlags of Our Fathers) that she allows him to be legally adopted into the eccentric family of her psychiatrist, Dr. Finch (Brian Cox). As the half-crazed Finch overmedicates Diedre into a haze of semi-conscious madness, he also turns Augusten's life upside down while his wife (Jill Clayburgh) and daughters (Gwyneth Paltrow, Evan Rachel Wood) indulge their own eccentricities and Augusten enters into an intimate relationship with one of Finch's adopted patients (played by Joseph Fiennes).As adapted and directed by Nip/Tuck creator Ryan Murphy,Running with Scissorslacks the singular voice of Burroughs' dryly comedic first-person narrative, but even as the film struggles to find a consistent tone, it's so full of wacky behavior that you can't help laughing. It's a messy, patchwork quilt of a movie, blessed by authentically garish '70s production design and a soundtrack of familiar '70s hits. In rendering Burroughs' indelible portrait of weak, irresponsible adults and the people they victimize, Murphy and his well-chosen cast (which also includes Alec Baldwin as Diedre's ex-husband) find moments of touching pathos amidst the madness. For her part, Bening delivers an acclaimed performance that gives the film a dramatic weight it otherwise lacks. The rest is for anyone who enjoys a laugh at the freak-show expense of damaged and damaging characters. --Jeff ShannonStills fromRunning with Scissors(click for larger image)MoreRunning with Scissorson Amazon.comThe BookMore Films staring Annette BeningMore Films about Eccentric Families", "related": {"also_bought": ["031242227X", "125003440X", "031242681X", "0312428278", "0312422288", "0312315953", "0312341911", "0312272057", "B00003CWQR", "0312563558", "B0034G4OZE", "B001TK2BMK", "1250032105", "B000CS464G", "B006G7YSP4", "B000087F7E", "0312315945", "B000JBWWQA", "B000KX0IOK", "B00AEFXESQ", "140006869X", "B00007JXWX", "B00AFEY354", "B00013RC2K", "B0000640VJ", "B00005JMJG", "0312283709", "1427200718", "B00175VSBC", "B0000AC8LR", "B0016MJ6T2", "B00AEFYSWM", "B000EHQU0S", "0307395987", "B00049QQHI", "0312315961", "B002VECLVO", "B004SEUIZG", "6305784817", "B00005Q4CS", "B0007PALGG", "B0006TPE4C", "B00008DP4C", "B00005JLSB", "B00001PE4D", "B00005JLHW", "B000FVQLQQ", "B003L20ICE", "B000N3SU92", "B00004UEDQ", "B0007G89FK", "B000MEYKD2", "B001JIE7JC", "B004FQX5B6", "B0014D5RBE", "B00070EBOY", "B00003CWTI", "B007HRKBI0", "0307396185", "B0057ZAA6W", "B005PTMPYA", "B0041KKYEM", "B00ADRYCWC", "0312938853", "B000F6II1M", "B0001DMVBC", "B0053XZ8O2", "B00008972P", "B0001EFUFK", "B0014GI6I2", "B00DW5IKYS", "B000E33VWW", "B0058ZPNOK", "B006QVRVJK", "B0036TGT8Y", "B00FXWAZW8", "B000QGDY0G", "B004H83IG4", "B005C7SXMS", "B000A7DVR2", "B0016LFG4C", "0800177789", "B002LMV7RA", "B00004TWZH", "B00CC2V7AQ", "B005DI8X3K", "B00EYPJHDI", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00AEFY8MM", "B000H9I1OG", "0316777730", "B00005JLQH", "B000092T3P", "B0043X1FL8", "B0010X8NF0", "B004499LX0", "B00AEFXUXU", "B008N25X7M", "B002DP0J24", "B0007UC8Y4"], "bought_together": ["031242227X", "125003440X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002HJ3KD6", "125003440X", "1250032105", "B000GQLCQY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 56416}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.5, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000M5B98A", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51xHRfPC6cL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Running With Scissors"}
