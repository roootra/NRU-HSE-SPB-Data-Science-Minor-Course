{"description": "Grab an econo-pack of tissues, gather your loved ones around a cozy  television, and bring on the hot cocoa--it's time for a dose of Christmas  spirit. The tender and charming Mary Steenburgen (Parenthood) dons a sour disposition in her role as Ginny Grainger, a woman who finds little joy in life  lately--let alone in the impending holiday season. Money is tight, her  husband (beautifully downplayed by nice-guy Gary Basaraba) lost his job,  and the family must move out of their house. Ginny cannot even bring  herself to say, \"Merry Christmas,\" despite her family's enthusiasm about  the big day. With help from Ginny's brave and loving daughter (sweetly  performed by Elisabeth Harnois) and a Christmas angel named Gideon (Harry Dean  Stanton), Ginny undergoes a life-altering experience &agrave; laIt's a Wonderful Life. The result? Happy endings, hugs and  kisses, pass the tissues.Not a light holiday entertainer by any means, the plot verges on  depressing at times, as the family struggles through money issues and the  tedium of daily suburban survival. While handled fairly subtly, some of  the bridging story--including a shooting, a kidnapping, and a  drowning--might prove disturbing to children under 6 years old. And  really: if the somber Harry Dean Stanton (Paris, Texas) repeatedly  appeared in your neighborhood, cloaked in a cowboy hat and overcoat,  would you allow your kids outside? Still, a well-made favorite to  cherish.--Liane Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301752627"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 392357}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.77, "brand": "", "asin": "0764007211", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CE6WPRT4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "One Magic Christmas [VHS]"}
{"description": "Arguably the most intelligently written film to feature the masterful stop-motion animation of Ray Harryhausen,Jason and the Argonautsis a colorful adventure that takes full advantage of Harryhausen's \"Dynarama\" process. Inspired by the Greek myth, the story begins when the fearless explorer Jason (Todd Armstrong) returns to the kingdom of Thessaly to make his rightful claim to the throne, but the gods proclaim that he must first find the magical Golden Fleece. Consulting Hera, the queen of gods, Jason recruits the brave Argonauts to crew his ship, and they embark on their eventful journey. Along the way they encounter a variety of mythic creatures, including the 100-foot bronze god Talos, the batlike Harpies, the seven-headed reptilian Hydra, and an army of skeletons wielding sword and shield. This last sequence remains one of the finest that Harryhausen ever created, and it's still as thrilling as anything from the age of digital special effects. Harryhausen was the true auteur of his fantasy films, and his brilliant animation evokes a timeless sense of wonder.Jason and the Argonautsis a prime showcase for Harryhausen's talent--a wondrous product of pure imagination and filmmaking ingenuity.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001DB6J50", "0767847431", "B00004TJJV", "B002ZD3V10", "B00006JDRG", "B000062XE5", "B001DZOCY6", "B000QGEB1W", "B00007JMD8", "B00018D3ZA", "B00005LKHN", "B0045HCJSA", "B003DVNUUK", "B00005Y6XR", "B000SAGGL4", "B00005JKU0", "B000095WW6", "B00006AUGK", "B008XTVWHK", "B004B93RDS", "B0037JO0X4", "B000SFJ4K4", "B000FOPPEC", "B00AEBB8VK", "B0001BKBFC", "B000BMY2KG", "B0007R4T1W", "B00005JKFR", "B000VULA94", "B000AQKU72", "B0024FADBK", "B000O78KWE", "B0044O1Q60", "B000062XF2", "B0001NBMDK", "B000B7MX7A", "B000063UR0", "B00ALTQRUC", "B000HEWEDK", "B001BGS17Q", "B005OT7YX8", "B00004TJK0", "B005E7SFDI", "B000056AXZ", "B00007ELD2", "0783240961", "B000EHQTZO", "B00152VXUS", "B00005R1O8", "0783240953", "B000YDOOHI", "B00A33J8R0", "B00009NHC0", "B0024LIBDQ", "B00518A70E", "B0007R4T26", "B000A6T1ZE", "B0074JOUHE", "B0001I55XI", "B00D9EJFZA", "B002945DU2", "B000O78KY2", "B000Y2Q9J0", "B00AEBB94G", "B00005RRG7", "B0006B2A7E", "B00005JMH8", "B0045HCJKS", "6305869367", "B000FVQLKW", "B0006GANX2", "B000MGTQ7U", "6305761078", "B000056NWI", "B000AYELJ2", "B001AR0D40", "B005R2SHIS", "B00094ARW8", "B00A33J90G", "B000A9QK7I", "B00BQ7GU1Y", "B006TTC5J0", "B004FZWDPG", "B0002KPHW4", "0790742829", "B00B2M7DKA", "B004QF71ZW", "B0024FAG2G", "B00005JN8Z", "B00000F17E", "B003L7DK60", "B00006JMQG"], "bought_together": ["B001DB6J50", "0767847431"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001DB6J50", "0767847431", "B00004TJJV", "B002ZD3V10"]}, "price": 29.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12182}, "asin": "0767810864", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WNMTYA9qL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jason and the Argonauts"}

{"description": "From the sun-dappled heartland, a young man (Robert Redford, in soft lighting) emerges as maybe the best baseball player anybody's ever seen. On his way to the majors, he is cut down by an enigmatic black widow (Barbara Hershey) and vanishes for many years. When he reemerges, a silent mystery, he lands a spot with the New York team and begins tearing up the league--he's still the natural. Fans of the Bernard Malamud novel will be dismayed at the pure mythical hokum of this film, but baseball fanatics have been known to watch and rewatch this one; after all, it's constructed as a kind of shrine to the national pastime. Barry Levinson (Rain Man) directs the movie with an unabashed devotion to the game, although the film could use more of the realities of chewing tobacco and pine tar. Redford is fine, and Kim Basinger and Oscar-nominated Glenn Close are effective as the women in his life. The crowning touch is the soaring, extraordinary music by Randy Newman, the singer-songwriter turned orchestral composer.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005M20M", "0783235968", "B000068NNT", "630273973X", "6302534372", "6302415853", "6305132666", "0800121600", "6304291698", "B00004RGUU", "6305126062", "630596260X", "B0000399WO", "6301734734", "6303597874", "6302936381", "B00000I1DI", "6303014100", "076780922X", "B0000048ZL", "6300181472", "0792841786", "0790743159", "0792839846", "5559477621", "6302226899", "6302450179", "6302023742", "B0000068ZQ", "630018224X", "6300183513", "630299005X", "B00004RFFA", "B0000068EE", "630150528X", "6300246965", "B00000JGEI", "B000M5BRX2", "6300215695", "6302360978", "6302909023", "6300181154", "6300184927", "0800179552"], "bought_together": ["B00005M20M", "0783235968"], "also_viewed": ["0783235968", "B000003KMM", "B0000399WO", "6300216810"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 348212}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.79, "brand": "", "asin": "0767809262", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51816SHE4HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Natural [VHS]"}
{"description": "Forever embroiled in controversy,Midnight Expressdivides viewers into opposing camps: those who think it's one of the most intense real-life dramas ever made, and those who abhor its manipulative tactics and alteration of facts for the exploitative purpose of achieving a desired effect. That effect is powerfully achieved, regardless of how you may feel about director Alan Parker and Oscar&reg;-winning screenwriter Oliver Stone's interpretation of the story of Billy Hayes. It was the American Hayes--played by the late Brad Davis in an unforgettable performance--who was caught smuggling two kilograms of hashish while attempting to board a flight from Istanbul, Turkey, in 1970. He was sentenced to four years in a hellish Turkish prison on a drug possession charge, but his sentence was later extended (though not by 30 years, as the film suggests), and Hayes endured unthinkable brutality and torture before his escape in 1975.Unquestionably, this is a superbly crafted film, provoking a visceral response that's powerful enough to boil your blood. By the time Hayes erupts in an explosion of self-defensive violence, Parker and Stone have proven the power--and danger--of their skill. Their film is deeply manipulative, extremely xenophobic, and embellishes reality to heighten its calculated impact. Is that a crime? Not necessarily, and there's no doubt thatMidnight Expressis expertly directed and blessed with exceptional supporting performances (especially from John Hurt as a long-term prisoner). Still, it's obvious that strings are being pulled, and Parker, while applying his talent to a nefarious purpose, is a masterful puppeteer.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0008ENHUI", "0988981440", "0792833287", "B006TTC5HC", "B00007ELEY", "B004FQX5B6", "B000RTB0R6", "B000CNESTE", "B000001FBZ", "B0071HPP3M", "B00AEFXVOI", "B00AEBB95K", "B0019UGYK0", "B003ELKNH2", "0767830555", "B000059TFO", "B00079Z9VO", "B00013RC2U", "B0006GANN2", "B00005MEOU", "B00AEFXN9G", "079284646X", "B000C20VPA", "B000P0J0AG", "B0006GAOJA", "B00008O38F", "B00AEBB9UK", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B007N31YH0", "B000067IZ3", "0792846443", "6305132917", "B000A2UBN4", "B002AT8KAG", "B00AEFXV3E", "B000C20VRS", "0792838408", "B000286RP2", "B0038Z5T4Q", "B00066FBQG", "B000P0J0EW", "B00049QJ9I", "B001PYD0PC", "0800141806", "B00AEFYRP0", "B0000YEEGM", "B0000DI87S", "B0002V7ON8", "B00407PNY2", "B001R3YRG2", "B003O7I6SE", "B00AEFXEZE", "6304765258", "B000EHSVS2", "B00005U2KC", "B003TRMLQM", "B00005M2CO", "B000063US2", "B0045HCJFS", "B00AEFXBPM", "B0001US62I", "B000E5N684", "B003LMPKSQ", "B001G1FL3S", "B00009W5CA", "B000022TSY", "B00005LC4D", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00011CZRE", "B000ZM1MG4", "B00005JXY5", "B00005NB8K", "B00006ADD5", "B000P0J09M", "B000PAAJZ6", "B004SIP8ZM", "B0013XZ2QK", "B007UW9W5U", "B00B0U2SFE", "B000059HAN", "B0010YVCI4", "B00004ZBVF", "B0009UZG3C", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00AEFXD1O", "B000XJD34I", "B00IA7MFEO", "B00002VWE0", "B000M341QE", "B0007KIFGE", "B00007BKVC", "B003ASLJJK", "B00AEBBADG", "B007TBIUSM", "B00AEFXG2U", "B000LP6KNU", "B00005JLRE", "B003INBNOS"], "bought_together": ["B0008ENHUI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0988981440", "078322947X", "B003ELKNH2", "B00005PJ8T"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 132494}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.28, "brand": "", "asin": "0767817486", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/714SYCVAS8L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Midnight Express"}

{"description": "In this day of movies in which one can't tell whether the action was manufactured by computer generation or by a cookie cutter,The Mask of Zorrois a grand throwback. It recalls and celebrates the fantasy workshop that Hollywood was and can be at its best. It's an audience pleaser in the best sense of the word, combining great-looking performers with gorgeous vistas and production design, a story that is familiar yet never insults the viewer's intelligence, and plenty of eye-popping action.Anthony Hopkins stars as the original Zorro, a masked vigilante protecting his people from official corruption in Mexico and what will become California (from Hannibal Lecter to Merchant-Ivory to action hero--is there nothing this man cannot do?). He's imprisoned for his troubles, and upon his release, mentors an impetuous pupil (Antonio Banderas, more suave than ever) in the fine arts of swordplay and triumphing over evil. Catherine Zeta-Jones capably portrays the beauty linked to both men--Zorro I's daughter, Zorro II's object of desire.The plotting contains few surprises, but the interplay between the three leads is always winning, and the winks to the swashbuckling genre are playful without ever being heavy-handed or campy.--David Kronke", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00006ADFM", "B000CEXGAU", "0792839137", "6305428077", "B002PQKNRC", "B000A9QK8M", "B00641MFCK", "B0041KKBFE", "B000ENC5YW", "B008VR7TWG", "B0000A2ZU1", "B002GHHHP6", "B002VWNID6", "B0000WN140", "0800141601", "B0055CMM0O", "6305692688", "B000007T5P", "B003BJODK0", "B00000JQB5", "B0029R81BC", "B00005N5SB", "B00004XPPG", "B00005JKE1", "B000FO0AA6", "B000OT6V64", "B00005N5SA", "B00005ATZT", "0767803434", "0783233477", "B00000G3PA", "B00003CXQG", "B00003CXTA", "B00158K0QU", "0767836324", "B001LMAK88", "B00177YA1K", "B00D9EJFTQ", "B000JYW5BE", "B0049IHX2C", "B00005JN5E", "B0000B1OFL", "B000FUTVLY", "B000OLR8VY", "6304711905", "B003HKN52U", "B00008K76U", "B000U34PM6", "B00008G8M4", "0767817710", "B00006ZXSK", "B000AP04FG", "0800195175", "B00AEFZ2DG", "B00003CY0V", "B004P7CN5O", "B00005LOL0", "B0013BM63O"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00006ADFM", "B000CEXGAU", "0792839137", "6305428077"]}, "price": 15.21, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1124295}, "asin": "0767823729", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EQXJWFHRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "One Fine Morning"}
{"description": "An obvious attempt to cash in on the success ofJaws, this 1977 thriller was also based on a bestseller by Peter Benchley, and it features a memorable performance by Robert Shaw (the doomed shark hunter inJaws) in one of the last roles of his career. Looking very tanned and healthy, Nick Nolte and Jacqueline Bisset play a young couple enjoying a tropical vacation who discover a glass ampoule while scuba diving off the coast of Bermuda. It takes a seasoned treasure hunter (Shaw) to identify the ampoule as part of a valuable shipment of World War II morphine lost at sea, coincidentally, atop the even greater treasure of a sunken Spanish galleon. Thus begins a race for drugs and treasure pitting Nolte, Bisset, and Shaw against a ruthless drug lord (Louis Gossett Jr.) who'll do anything--even resort to Haitian voodoo--to get what he wants. It's all rather contrived and exploitative (after all, the movie's best known for Bisset's wet T-shirt scuba-dive), but as escapist entertainment goes it's got some exciting highlights including a moray eel that attacks on cue and... well, uh, Jacqueline Bisset in a wet T-shirt.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004YMATCY", "B007STBUHI", "B00008G8LY", "B0012KJ0DK", "B00005NKSZ", "0792844017", "B00005A8XX", "B00979KQD6", "B00008WFU4", "0783230516", "B0062KMDGG", "B00AEFYSR2", "0553140531", "B00407PNY2", "B0030VANHQ", "B00153ZR8G", "B00018D3ZA", "B00005LQ0I", "B00AEFYEU8", "B000KGGIVY", "B00BGQ2P9G", "B000M53GNG", "B0045HCJKS", "B000P0J0BU", "B000E5N684", "B00J2G4ZAY", "B00005JKU0", "B003ASLJRC", "B0001FGC1U", "B001RP974M", "B00005N5S3", "B00008WFU5", "B000EHSVNW", "B00005QCVP", "B000M69SJG", "B005ETALYW", "0767802497", "0790731932", "B00AEFYBA6", "B00LC4PCVU", "079073639X", "B000NQRR1G", "0767802470", "B0045HCJ8A", "B003ASLJPE", "B000MGTQ7U", "B006XMK11W", "6305213283", "B0008ENHTY", "0792838408", "B00008K76U", "B00CPTUOI2", "B0079ZWUCA", "B0007O38ZS", "B0013LL2Z2"], "bought_together": ["B007STBUHI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004TDTO", "B00005A8XX", "B00153ZR8G", "B000BYRCGU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 80595}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.75, "brand": "BISSET,JACQUELINE", "asin": "0767818067", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51D-CGOvhTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Deep"}

{"description": "Unanimously hailed as one of the greatest masterpieces in the history of the motion picture,Seven Samuraihas inspired countless films modeled after its basic premise. But Akira Kurosawa's classic 1954 action drama has never been surpassed in terms of sheer power of emotion, kinetic energy, and dynamic character development. The story is set in the 1600s, when the residents of a small Japanese village are seeking protection against repeated attacks by a band of marauding thieves. Offering mere handfuls of rice as payment, they hire seven unemployed \"ronin\" (masterless samurai), including a boastful swordsman (Toshiro Mifune) who is actually a farmer's son desperately seeking glory and acceptance. The samurai get acquainted with but remain distant from the villagers, knowing that their assignment may prove to be fatal. The climactic battle with the raiding thieves remains one of the most breathtaking sequences ever filmed. It's poetry in hyperactive motion and one of Kurosawa's crowning cinematic achievements. This is not a film that can be well served by any synopsis; it must be seen to be appreciated (accept nothing less than its complete 203-minute version) and belongs on the short list of any definitive home-video library.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000K0YM0Y", "B001BEK8E2", "B000K0YLZ0", "B00005B1ZL", "B007N5YK10", "B002E01MBA", "B00K5EJHGO", "B00005JLEJ", "B00687XNNK", "B0009WIE2A", "B004XQO8MS", "B001WLMOL4", "B000059TFW", "B000AQKUD6", "B00180R072", "B00005JLMU", "B000067IY6", "B00005UQ7T", "B000E5LEV0", "B000ASATM6", "B000BR6QCI", "B0001UZZSG", "B00005QAPH", "6305081034", "B0007989YS", "B00065GX0K", "B006H3KQSK", "B001PCNZJU", "B00005JLV7", "B005JJCMN0", "B000WEH74G", "B00065GX64", "6305028699", "B00AEFYSEA", "B000V7HFL4", "0792841409", "0780021061", "B000AQKUH2", "B005HK13S6", "B0017MO0U6", "B00B2BYXSQ", "B001LMU1B4", "B0040QYROA", "B0050FXDDQ", "0783225903", "B0045HCJTO", "0780021045", "B0012SY0E6", "B000055Y0X", "B00EO2I6W4", "B001LMU1C8", "B00158K0RO", "B00004W3HF", "B000MM0LEG", "B004S801ZO", "B008VF0Y02", "0780020707", "B000XPSC0C", "B00003CXBU", "B000025RE7", "B00006ADD5", "0780022343", "0783226039", "B000056NWP", "B00005NC66", "6305257450", "B002ZG4Q5W", "B007Y1NR1W", "6304698798", "B000FDECGA", "B002IVDLH8", "B004M66YUS", "B00004Y7HL", "B002VRNJDA", "0767830555", "B0010YSD7W", "B004L9GMBC", "B001O549G6", "B003ZEQMH8", "B002VWNIAY", "B000VARC3C", "B003152Z4U", "B002U6DVPS", "B0000B1ODQ", "B00AEBB89C", "B008Y5OVZ8", "B0045HCJ9E", "B0087ZG7R0", "B005VU9LO0", "B0006GANN2", "B00AEFYL6K", "B00004TJKI", "B00DHN8FXG", "B0006GAOJA", "B003AWRMCE", "B000PKG6O4", "B00003CXR4", "B00HE01030", "B00ENNBZ68", "B006LLY8LY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005VU9LO0", "B001BEK8E2", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00008RH1H"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 158968}, "asin": "0780020685", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51175A95QSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Seven Samurai (Criterion Collection Spine #2)"}

{"description": "If you only had one Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers film to watch,this classic musical from 1936 would be your best bet. It was the dance duo's sixth film together, and director George Stevens handled the material with as much flair behind the camera as Fred and Ginger displayed in front of it. This time out, Fred plays a gambling hoofer who's engaged to marry a young socialite (Betty Furness), but when he's late for the wedding his prospective father-in-law sends him away, demanding that he earn $25,000 before he can earn his daughter's hand in marriage. When Fred meets Ginger in a local dance studio (where he pretends to be a klutz so she can be his instructor), he's instantly smitten and the $25,000 deal becomes a moot point. Featuring six songs by Jerome Kern and Dorothy Fields (including a splendid rendition of \"The Way You Look Tonight\") and some of the most elegant dance sequences ever filmed, this lightweight fluff epitomizes the jazz-age style of 1930s musicals, virtually defining the genre with graceful joie de vivre.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EQ3R6Y", "0780625765", "6301327853", "0780625773", "B00000F6D1"], "bought_together": ["B000EQ3R6Y", "0780625765"], "also_viewed": ["B000EQ3R6Y", "B0009NSCR6", "B00406UJZG", "6301327853"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 194508}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.98, "brand": "", "asin": "078062579X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H4N1HYKKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Swing Time [VHS]"}
{"description": "Fantastical writer Gary Ross (Big,Dave) makes an  auspicious directorial debut with this inspired and oddly touching comedy about two '90s kids (Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon) thrust into the black-and-white TV world ofPleasantville, aLeave It to Beaver-style sitcom complete with picket fences, corner malt shop, and warm chocolate chip cookies. When a somewhat unusual remote control (provided by repairman Don Knotts) transports them from the jaded real world to G-rated TV land, Maguire and Witherspoon are forced to play along as Bud and Mary Sue, the obedient children of George and Betty Parker (William&nbsp;H. Macy and Joan Allen). Maguire, an obsessivePleasantvilledevotee, understands the need for not toppling the natural balance of things; Witherspoon, on the other hand, starts shaking the town up, most notably when she takes basketball stud Skip (Paul Walker) up to Lover's Lane for some modern-day fun and games. Soon enough, Pleasantville's teens are discovering sex along with--gasp!--rock & roll, free thinking, and soul-changing Technicolor. Filled with delightful and shrewd details about sitcom life (no toilets, no double beds, only two streets in the town),Pleasantvilleis a joy to watch, not only for its comedy but for the groundbreaking visual effects and astonishing production design as the town gradually transforms from crisp black and white to glorious color. Ross does tip his hand a bit about halfway through the film, obscuring the movie's basic message of the unpredictability of life with overloaded and obvious symbolism, as the black-and-white denizens of the town gang up on the \"coloreds\" and impose rules of conduct to keep their strait-laced town laced up. Still, the characterizations from the phenomenal cast--especially repressed housewife Allen and soda-shop owner Jeff Daniels, doing some of their best work ever--will keep you emotionally invested in the film's outcome, and waiting to see Pleasantville in all its final Technicolor glory.--Mark Englehart", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 436957}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.82, "brand": "", "asin": "0780627024", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C118QWETL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pleasantville [VHS]"}

{"description": "From the mind of comic-book maestro Todd MacFarlane comes the second season of episodes of the animatedSpawn. Highly stylized animation and provocative story lines makeSpawna sophisticated cartoon sometimes more appropriate for older audiences. Murder victim Al Simmons has returned from hell to earth as a \"hellspawn,\" a soldier for the army of darkness sent to collect more souls for hell. The injustice of his death and his former life as a dedicated husband throws a wrench into hell's plan--Spawn remembers his human life and fights the inclination to do evil. Still, he is vengeful and he walks the line between killing for justice and just plain killing.In these episodes, Spawn meets the man who assassinated him and becomes suspect of the organization that ordered him killed. Jason Wynn, the leader of the group, has plans to sell weapons of mass destruction stolen from the military. Spawn's former wife Wanda has since remarried Terry Fitzgerald, with whom Spawn must reconcile. Terry is hot on the trail of the missing arms, and Wynn and his assassins, including the highly trained Merrick, set out to kill Terry, Wanda, and their daughter Cyan. Spawn foils the plot while realizing the hard truth that Wanda has a new life.Spawn 2is the slick and darkly realized animated adaptation of the popular comic book of the same name. It features the voice talents of Keith David (Spawn), who appeared inDead Presidents, Denise Poirier (Merrick), and John Rafter Lee (Wynn), who also is the voice of Aeon Flux and Trevor Goodchild in the popular animated seriesAeon Flux.--Shannon Gee", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000Q66PX4", "078311494X", "6304698763", "6304712499", "B007NRWLZ0", "B002WJHDJI", "160706071X", "B000B8I9XQ", "B002XJDUZI", "B000PFUAP0", "1607064898", "B00IQ8TT82", "B000NY0YJK", "B007ILZAA4", "B00000F0AD", "B009AVC922", "B0036EH3XY", "B001F7MSFM", "B00004WG2D", "B002DYKPFQ", "B00HFWETQW", "B0002MFG0K", "B000U34SS2", "B003B2C92G", "B00465I19C", "B00AQ590IC", "B000OT6V00", "B00I40K6RU", "1607061198", "B00ENNBZ68", "B0000VCZMK", "B00C7C00JU", "B00005V1XW", "B00GZ0ML4C", "B001QIVEVE", "B0062P3392", "B00FM4S7KO", "B004P7CMOQ", "B001451HX4", "1582400199", "B002WNUVK2", "B0010TDRP0", "B00007AJG4", "B001AK3S4Y", "B00009MGEM", "B006UKX5V0", "078401132X", "B004E8AARM", "B006WDWBK6", "B0077T5SN6", "B000FO0AG0", "B00004YZGB", "B0001O3YA8", "B001LK8SQ6", "B002CGT0TW", "B000AXWHSA", "B00D97DLYS", "B002XJDUVM", "B001ECDVKE", "B00097DY2U", "B001QB9H1U", "B000EZ7ZZO", "B00A2LFXVI", "6305047456", "B001614E68", "B00CERJIH8", "B00BBAQD6S", "B00E688U9K", "B003NH6FY2", "B0001MZ7K0", "B00JL6L4WC", "B000FGGE68", "B000063US5", "B000FS9MVK", "B000KJTFEI", "B0002IQMAM", "B008RV5K4U", "B00BGI07GC", "078321958X", "B00009XS6J", "B000PFSYO4", "1563891441", "B0000AQS81", "B00069L0Z4", "B0007P0Y7C", "6304493681", "B002QEHPR4", "B00441GYS8", "B002ZG98LO", "B000OVLBF8", "B008C0C1Y8", "B002GSXKNI", "B000K7UC2Y", "B000QXDED6", "B00005JL93", "B007QWF26C", "0767824555", "B0002KPIQY", "B0085A9HU6"], "bought_together": ["B000Q66PX4", "6304712499"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000Q66PX4", "6304712499", "B002WJHDJI", "160706071X"]}, "price": 9.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 38999}, "asin": "0783114338", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51V1A3RAV4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Spawn 2"}
{"description": "Originally broadcast in April and May of 1998, the epic miniseriesFrom the Earth to the Moonwas HBO's most expensive production to date, with a budget of $68 million. Hosted by executive producer Tom Hanks, the miniseries tackles the daunting challenge of chronicling the entire history of NASA'sApollospace program from 1961 to 1972. For the most part, it's a rousing success. Some passages are flatly chronological, awkwardly wedging an abundance of factual detail into a routine dramatic structure. But each episode is devoted to a crucial aspect of the Apollo program. The cumulative effect is a deep and thorough appreciation of NASA's monumental achievement. With the help of a superlative cast, consistent writing, and a stable of talented directors, Hanks has shared his infectious enthusiasm for space exploration and the inspiring power of conquering the final frontier.NASA's complete participation in the production lends to its total authenticity, right down to the use of NASA equipment, launch locations, and even spacecraft. The re-creation of the lunar landscape is almost as impressive as the real thing and is further enhanced by the use of helium balloons to lighten the actors playing moon-walking astronauts. (These and other backstage details are revealed in the \"making of\" featurette, along with a wealth of supplemental materials, on a bonus disc in the miniseries' DVD package.) With a fictional, Walter Cronkite-like TV reporter (Lane Smith) serving as the dramatic link for all 12 episodes, this ambitious production may not be a great work of art. But as a generous and definitive example of nonfiction drama, it's full of the same kind of awe, inspiration, and humanity that led to \"one giant leap\" in the all-too-short history of 20th-century space exploration.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000XJ5TPE", "B001BEK8CY", "B004GJYRI2", "B0026IQTR2", "0783225733", "014311235X", "B000V7O0DU", "B00E2083J4", "B0002TSZQ0", "1439148813", "B00371QQ2U", "1588342735", "B0026VBOIS", "B0006FYOTC", "B0026VBOJC", "0395670292", "0670020788", "B003NOGNPQ", "B00004U2MS", "0374531943", "0525945717", "1453258264", "B00080ETMM", "0307262928", "B00FA8Y2OW", "B004ODLUF8", "B000002OW6", "0312427565", "0060194162", "1613749015", "B001DE29SI", "B00008MTVZ", "074325631X", "0307463451", "0151004676", "B00IWULSTC", "0743200799", "0375406344", "B00IWULQQ2", "0062296086", "0867130504", "0618619585", "B00008G8LY", "B004GWVQGA", "B00D7AM2GA", "B002GHHHKQ", "B005QW98AK", "B001IBIHQ4", "B00H83EV5W", "B00006CXSS", "0792838408", "B001YV504U", "B00AZMFJYA", "B000055ZOB", "B00129H7VS", "B004AOECXI", "B008FD36IC", "0316253014", "B000LXGXY8", "B004AR4WSA", "B00HWWUQYY"], "bought_together": ["B004GJYRI2", "0783225733"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001BEK8CY", "0783225733", "B000XJ5TPE", "B004GJYRI2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 111613}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 87.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0783114222", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41HVKCSFH1L._SX300_.jpg", "title": "From the Earth to the Moon (Four Disc Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "A mixed bag that received mixed reviews when released in 1994, this lavish film works overtime to honor the spirit and style of the vintage pulp novels and radio shows that madeThe Shadowa household name in the 1930s and '40s. Alec Baldwin plays the Shadow, a.k.a. Lamont Cranston, who arrives in New York from his decadent life in Tibet, fully reformed and disciplined in his ability \"to cloud men's minds.\" A crime fighter who lurks in the dark recesses of the city, the Shadow faces his most deadly challenge when Shiwan Khan (John Lone), the last surviving descendant of Genghis Khan, hatches a plot to conquer the world. The scheme involves a madman (Tim Curry), a hapless scientist (Ian McKellen), and various traps designed to catch and kill the Shadow, who must also contend with his blossoming romance with Margo Lane (Penelope Ann Miller), a slender beauty capable of a little mind play of her own. The movie's art deco production design turns out to be a scene-stealer when the plot drags, and in the title role Baldwin is never given enough good material to create a compelling character. Still,The Shadowis true to the legacy that inspired it, admirably avoiding any conspicuous compromise of its 1930s style and setting. If you can't get into the story, you're sure to be hooked by the look of the production, which is never less than dazzling.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00BTYMPUY", "6305428514", "B003Q7B7BU", "B00005T7I1", "B000PFUAP0", "B00801OMDM", "B00264QI68", "B000051SH3", "0783226012", "B0002J58J2", "B0080JTIX8", "B004BBHVIS", "B005E7SF7E", "B0038ZITIE", "B0006IIPIK", "1558908846", "B000FVQLKM", "1606903616", "B000ION23U", "B004EPZ07K", "B003G5K7RW", "B005G5NPD8", "B00007AJF5", "B00003CWU3", "B0011367SY", "B00JL6L4UY", "B0045HCJKS", "B001RHGRT8", "0800195175", "B0009ZBVBI", "B004EXWGJW", "0780622650", "B0006L0LOS", "6304712499", "B00005JKU0", "B000056WR3", "B0000YEEPS", "B0002A2VLY", "B0002J58HO", "B00AKGG828", "0790738511", "B0045HCJT4", "B00D3LA7G0", "B000056PMU", "B000055Y0Y", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B002GHHHNI", "B000AQOHNA", "B0019BI1DM", "078401132X", "B002GHHHOM", "B00004Y87O", "6305127646", "B0085A9HU6", "B002NZK5Q4", "B002GHHHME", "B0024FADAQ", "0767818105", "B000CNE09M", "B00006IUJO", "B004VT9JLC", "B00026ZG10", "B0000844I8", "B0045HCJGC", "B00003CXKA", "0767802454", "B002GHHHP6", "B000QUCQX8", "B001ARDC16", "0783225547", "B003Q7B71K", "B001MVYUQG", "B00070FX5U", "B004EPYZPS", "B00HFWETQW", "0783225946", "B0006HBZXS", "B0002V7OI8", "B002VWNID6", "B00GOYC3P6", "6305761078", "B00BTYOYG2", "B000BR9SA0", "0790731932", "1570199450", "B0001I55SS", "B0000959N0", "B0009MDPYM", "B00007AJGH", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B0002TSZHY", "B00009NHC0", "B0051PLQR0", "B001FB55HQ", "B00AEFXPG2", "B009L4DSV4", "B0001US8F8", "B0002J58GU", "B000WC39P4", "B000063UR0"], "bought_together": ["B00BTYMPUY", "6305428514"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BTYMPUY", "6305428514", "B003Q7B7BU", "0783226012"]}, "price": 7.86, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17047}, "asin": "078321958X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QWAVSWAQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Shadow"}

{"description": "Arnold Schwarzenegger made a successful transition to comedy with this 1990 box-office hit directed by Ivan Reitman. Arnold plays an undercover cop whose attempt to locate a little boy and his mother leads him to a small-town kindergarten class, where he poses as a teacher while continuing his investigation. He's also trying to catch a vicious drug dealer (Richard Tyson), whose ex-wife and son are the pair that Arnold's trying to rescue from impending danger. The scenes featuring Arnold and a classroom full of kindergartners are a real hoot, and Pamela Reed offers enjoyable support as Schwarzenegger's police partner, while Penelope Ann Miller (as another teacher) provides a low-key romantic interest and Carroll Baker steals her scenes as the villain's domineering mother. These familiar elements combine to make this a surprisingly lively and entertaining comedy-thriller, but parents are advised to heed the PG-13 rating: there are a lot of funny kids in the movie, but it's still a police thriller, with a violent climax that's not suitable for young viewers.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783226926", "B00026ZG10", "B00005T7HZ", "B00000G3TN", "B00HZMZ2FE", "0783230370", "B000Y11B7Q", "6305236569", "B000065V42", "B001LMAK9C", "B002GHHHME", "B00AKGG828", "B00070FX5U", "B0009DWL8W", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00ALTQRRK", "B000TJBN6W", "B00004RJ73", "B000RW3VCK", "B00015YVDG", "B00081U7HC", "0767803434", "B0000WN0UU", "B00005T7I2", "B000FO0AA6", "B0006GANOQ", "6305433925", "B00AEFXT1S", "0783219806", "078322740X", "0783230494", "B0002J58HO", "B000068QPM", "B00005N5S5", "6305428050", "B00000IQW2", "B002XUBDRY", "0783227396", "B00AEFY4CG", "0767804309", "B000056PMU", "B008R65XKQ", "0783225547", "B000K7VHTQ", "B002GHHHNS", "B00AEBB9E6", "6305428271", "B00004STDN", "6304602944", "B00008G8LM", "B00005JMCW", "B000FO0A9W", "B001SXZ7T2", "B0028ZDJN0", "B000YGGNMO", "0800177258", "B00158K0QU", "B002VWNID6", "B001OST0LW", "B0007PLLBU", "B00005PJ6N", "6305428395", "B00005JKCB", "B0043X1FLI", "B000P0J09W", "B00015YVD6", "B0045HCJGC", "0783227388", "0783229364", "B00JPQ1HX4", "B000065V3H", "0792844866", "B000YDBPAM", "B003VA3JUO", "B00005KAQP", "0783235070", "B0000AK7AA", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000RBA6C4", "0783231644", "B00008L3U1", "B00008G8M4", "B001OST0M6", "B005QX8U2Q", "0783225946", "B0001Z37HM", "6304806434", "0783227965", "B0006N2EZ0", "B000P0J0A6", "B00005T7I3", "B00000G3PA", "0767855000", "B00009WVSL", "B00005T7I1", "0790742071", "B00005JM4W", "B00AEFXPG2", "B00008O38G", "B0000UJDLM"], "bought_together": ["B00005T7HZ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0045HCJSA", "B000RJO56E", "0790732157", "B00ALTQRRK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8184}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.49, "brand": "Universal Pictures", "asin": "0783225504", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YE80NP76L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Kindergarten Cop"}

{"description": "A somewhat contrived screenplay doesn't stop this thriller from serving up some of the most spectacular fire sequences ever committed to film. Like any Ron Howard productionBackdraftis impressively slick and boasts a stellar cast, including Kurt Russell and William Baldwin.

Oscar winner Emma Thompson co-stars in this gripping film the Los Angeles Times calls, \"A politically charged 'Fugitive.'\" In the Name of the Father tells the true saga of Gerry Conlon.  A petty thief in strife-torn '70s Belfast, Gerry's main interests are getting drunk and partying, much to the dismay of his quiet, frail father Giuseppe (Pete Postlethwaite). When Gerry angers the IRA, his father sends him to England, where his antics land him in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Innocent, but forced to confess to a savage terrorist bombing, he is sentenced to life imprisonment as one of the \"Guildford Four.\"  An innocent Giuseppe is also arrested and jailed, and while behind bars, Gerry slowly learns that his father's seeming weakness masks an unmatched inner strength and wisdom. Working with a fiercely dedicated lawyer (Thompson), Gerry determines to prove his innocence, clear his father's name and expose the truth behind one of the most shameful legal events in recent history.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783227329", "B004U7MR1Y", "B000OCY7JO", "0790729407", "B00005V1WP", "B004TPJN9Q", "B007UW9W5U", "B003498SCQ", "B00008DDHZ", "B0009VRHNI", "B004499LWG", "B000005IQX", "B00013F2S6", "B004XVMCQ2", "B0009G3BCY", "B00B5A9FL4", "B000CBG5PG", "B0002V7SOS", "B00007K02D", "B004SIP7TE", "B000AQKV1C", "B00000ILEC", "0452272785", "0767833600", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00005JLR8", "B00000F3FS", "0767802578", "B00008R9KF", "B00004TJKJ", "B000CBG5PQ", "B000A2WP7O", "B002YMWPUA", "B000EHSVQO", "B000189LE2", "B001FB55OE", "B009YX8MSG", "B00078XGRY", "B001ADXX1E", "B000056BP3", "B005WAP2V0", "0783231202", "B00004W5U6", "B005SH65G8", "B003LL3FIY", "0800141806", "B00B5A9FP0", "B000X1Z0BU", "B00004TJKI", "B00DMDSC4S", "B00J5G1P2W", "B00J5LXT44", "087113702X", "B00009W5CA", "B000063US3", "B00441GYPG", "B0006Z2NAY", "B006TTC5HC", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B004IY6A0S", "B00IBKXQJS", "B000KX0IOA", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00CX7OWWA", "B00003CXC9", "B00005MEOU", "B0064MT1FI", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00K6D1QV8", "B0001DCYUU", "B0002V7ON8", "B000JYW5AK", "B0007PALZ2", "B002VWNICC", "B0002CR04A", "B0000714BW", "B00005B6JZ", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B000EHRVOM", "B009AMANBA", "B006FE83UE", "B002LYD2MG", "B0049BKOIY", "6304696515", "630542828X", "B0045HCJ8K", "B000LPR6GA", "B004FQX59I", "B000GG4Y32", "B00G15MDI0", "B00005JKG9", "B000H5TH20", "0767812158", "B00AEFXBPM", "B0057ZAA6W", "B001AMH7XA", "B004SUDQ72", "B000059TFO", "B00008DDVT", "0784011710"], "bought_together": ["B004U7MR1Y", "0783227329"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0790729407", "B000OCY7JO", "B004U7MR1Y", "B000005IQX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17197}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.95, "brand": "LEWIS,DANIEL DAY", "asin": "0783227906", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2BVccNfwrL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "In the Name of the Father"}
{"description": "Imitation of Life is a 1934 American drama film directed by John M. Stahl. The screenplay by William Hurlbut, based on Fannie Hurst's 1933 novel of the same name, was augmented by eight additional uncredited writers, including Preston Sturges and Finley Peter Dunne.[1] The film stars Claudette Colbert, Warren William and Rochelle Hudson and features Louise Beavers and Fredi Washington.  The theme of the movie, to the modern eye, deals with very important issues - passing, the role of black servants in white families, maternal affection-and remains very watchable.

{"description": "Alfred Hitchcock considered this 1943 thriller to be his personal favorite among his own films, and although it's not as popular as some of Hitchcock's later work, it's certainly worthy of the master's admiration. Scripted by playwright Thornton Wilder and inspired by the actual case of a 1920's serial killer known as \"The Merry Widow Murderer,\" the movie sets a tone of menace and fear by introducing a psychotic killer into the small-town comforts of Santa Rosa, California. That's where young Charlie (Teresa Wright) lives with her parents and two younger siblings, and where murder is little more than a topic of morbid conversation for their mystery-buff neighbor (Hume Cronyn). Charlie was named after her favorite uncle, who has just arrived for an extended visit, and at first Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotten) gets along famously with his admiring niece. But the film's chilling prologue has already revealed Uncle Charlie's true identity as the notorious Merry Widow Murderer, and the suspense grows almost unbearable when young Charlie's trust gives way to gradual dread and suspicion. Through narrow escapes and a climactic scene aboard a speeding train, this witty thriller strips away the fa&ccedil;ade of small-town tranquility to reveal evil where it's least expected. And, of course, it's all done in pure Hitchcockian style.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300183580", "6304039530", "1558807780", "6301670140", "0783221347", "0783235593", "6301798503", "0783235623", "6304039506", "6301975987", "630197350X", "6304429274", "6304359705", "6304457316", "6304119046", "6300183513", "6301798732", "6300215644", "6302909023", "B0000040EO", "630150528X", "0783222955", "6305123616", "0783217390", "0783235607", "6302278929", "6301797957", "6301798260", "B003MG6FJY", "0783235674", "6300158438", "6300215741", "6301564456", "0783235704", "6301327845", "6301586042", "6301800974", "B000003KE0", "0790733897", "6303020089", "0782008348", "6301977149", "6301969316", "6300183912", "6303364772", "6303957013", "1558804226", "6301973410", "B00004TX24", "6300988791", "630266232X", "6301973259", "6301670159", "0800100832", "0790743213", "6301640667", "6301969049", "B00004TYS8", "630196912X", "6302878535", "6302120101", "6300269264", "B00007JME0", "6302299497", "6302360978", "6300181421", "630160086X", "6302484421", "6302413435", "6300181340", "6302779782", "6302305942", "B0002IXSVI", "6301586026", "B00003OSTO", "0783235615", "6301964012", "079284517X", "0792837096", "B00000FZXC", "6302226899", "0783235682", "6300208133", "6301972171", "6302884705", "6302503493", "6302801133", "6303039693", "6304308418", "630196571X", "6301967682", "1558808590", "6303560067", "6305012792", "6300181723", "B000GX7MMA", "6303333079", "6301955625", "6301977815"], "bought_together": ["6300183580", "6301670140"], "also_viewed": ["6300183580", "6301670140"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 168467}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.5, "brand": "", "asin": "0783236352", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K145Q7XJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Shadow of a Doubt [VHS]"}

{"description": "Set in Harlem and New Orleans in 1955, this supernatural thriller stirred a brief controversy when released in 1987 because some scenes featuring Lisa Bonet (then a popular cast member ofThe Cosby Show) were considered too sexually explicit to be rated R.

Rourke's investigation leads him into an underworld of voodoo and forbidden desires, and as the mystery unfolds director Alan Parker fills every scene with conspicuous style and atmospheric excess, compelling critic Pauline Kael to observe that, &quot;Parker simply doesn't have the gift of making evil seductive, and he edits like a flasher.&quot; And yet, this movie does cast a spell of its own (Roger Ebert's review was considerably more charitable), and the performances of Rourke, De Niro, Bonet, and Charlotte Rampling are well suited to the ominous mood.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000AOX0E", "B003TRMLQM", "B0007VZ99E", "B002AS463W", "B00006JMPS", "B000059TFP", "B00005JKI5", "B0045HCJSU", "B002DYYGO2", "1453271139", "B00007EFIJ", "B000068IEX", "B00007BK2R", "B002CTJW0G", "B0009R1TI6", "B00004RE27", "B004LYWPZE", "B001U0HB5Q", "B00005V9HX", "0790750198", "B000HC2LHG", "B001TOD92C", "1573623857", "076782170X", "6305132917", "B00005JKJA", "0767830555", "B0006GAOJA", "B0000AOX0A", "B0001FGBW0", "6305238065", "6305308837", "B00008DDVY", "B000286RP2", "B003KV3E2C", "B0000DI87S", "6305262268", "B000E5N684", "B00005BCKG", "B000A2UBN4", "B0000542CH", "B000GGSMC6", "B0028OH568", "B0052ADPAU", "0859653862", "6305065551", "B000069HZO", "B000056PNL", "0783228457", "B000CR76U8", "B0045HCIYA", "B000TGJ80S", "0783225903", "B002VWNICC", "B0002KQNKE", "B00008CMRK", "B000NA1WEK", "B0019BI1DM", "6304936532", "B00008O38F", "B0002KPHZG", "B000ICL3NI", "B000P0J0AG", "B000QQFKYE", "B000063JDE", "B00008L3S6", "B001J710Y8", "079073219X", "B0041QSZM4", "B00E8G5HXM", "B00006RCNV", "6305177937", "B00827OWO8", "B000ZM1MGE", "B0024FADD8", "B00005V4XV", "B0056GLNLI", "B00096S48U", "B007XF0W3K", "B000059LGL", "B00007L4KF", "B00AEFXW8I", "0792833287", "B0045HCJTO", "B00013RC66", "B0006Z2LH4", "B00006L92U", "B0055CP9TU", "B00005LC4D", "B00005B6L0", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B00AEFXR8I", "B0013D8LKO", "B00003CXCF", "B000YENUI6", "B0002KPIQY", "B0016I0AJG", "B0043X1FNQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002AS463W", "B003TRMLQM", "B0041QSZTW", "6305065551"]}, "price": 12.08, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 295510}, "asin": "078401115X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51V7MKFPHCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Angel Heart"}
{"description": "Back in 1952, during the waning days of film noir, director  Richard Fleischer madeThe Narrow Margin, a cheaply produced, tightly structured B&nbsp;movie thriller about a cop forced to protect a gangster's widow while on a train. While it's no work of art, Fleischer's noir features a shocking climax of mistaken identity, an ominous, claustrophobic atmosphere, and tough, nearly unlikable protagonists screwed by fate, who spout sharp-witted dialogue and feel little more than contempt for each other. When Hollywood remakes itself, all the understatement and charm is usually lost when the filmmakers try to \"modernize\" the subject matter. This is one of many problems with writer-director Peter Hyams's remake (given the slightly shorter titleNarrow Margin). He's  dumped the surprising plot twist (it's now an action set piece atop a moving train) and softened the characters (now played with sleepwalking intensity by Gene Hackman and Anne Archer) with preposterous motivations. All that seems to be intact is the train premise, but Hyams is more interested in its action potential than any kind of menacing atmosphere. He's dropped the ambiguous relationships and smart dialogue in favor of pumping up the action sequences and daredevil stunts to ridiculous levels.

{"description": "B-movie mavens turned A-list genre fiends Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino teamed up in 1996 to take vampire gothic south of the border into spaghetti Western territory for the gory cult filmFrom Dusk Till Dawn. The high-concept mix of southwestern criminals versus supernatural nasties proved too irresistible for either of the video-hound creators to allow it to remain dead (or undead, as the case may be), so they plotted and produced a pair of direct-to-video sequels. Tarantino takes a story credit on the first, a heist film coscripted and directed by Scott Speigel. A Mexican bank robbery helmed by drawling criminal Robert Patrick (Terminator 2) turns into a literal bloodbath when his crew are turned into hungry bloodsuckers. Speigel, a buddy of Sam Raimi, tops both Tarantino and Rodriguez for sheer cinematic acrobatics, putting his camera in the most absurd places (even from inside the mouth of a vampire chomping down on a victim) and driving the film with adrenaline-charged overkill, but despite some clever scenes and a hilariousPsychospoof, it turns into another aggressively trashy latex-mask and rubber-bat gorefest as cops and robbers team up against the fanged gang. Bo Hopkins costars as the police detective dogging Patrick's trail. Bruce Campbell and Tiffani-Amber Thiessen make cameos in the jokey opening sequence and Speigel and fellow director Kevin Smith briefly appear as vampire bait. Bartender Danny Trejo is the only returning cast member.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 618931}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0788817000", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71F7SMB0MCL._SY300_.gif", "title": "From Dusk Till Dawn 2 - Texas Blood Money [VHS]"}
{"description": "Stanley Kubrick dissects the nature of violence in this darkly ironic, near-future satire, adapted from Anthony Burgess's novel, complete with \"Nadsat\" slang. Classical music-loving proto-punk Alex (Malcolm McDowell) and his \"Droogs\" spend their nights getting high at the Korova Milkbar before embarking on \"a little of the old ultraviolence,\" such as terrorizing a writer, Mr. Alexander (Patrick Magee), and gang raping his wife (who later dies as a result). After Alex is jailed for bludgeoning the Cat Lady (Miriam Karlin) to death with one of her phallic sculptures, Alex submits to the Ludovico behavior modification technique to earn his freedom; he's conditioned to abhor violence through watching gory movies, and even his adored Beethoven is turned against him. Returned to the world defenseless, Alex becomes the victim of his prior victims, with Mr. Alexander using Beethoven's Ninth to inflict the greatest pain of all. When society sees what the state has done to Alex, however, the politically expedient move is made.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790734079", "0790705141", "B00004U8PA", "B00000FZCU", "6303953425", "6304484054", "0783235607", "6304039220", "630268644X", "B00006G8O1", "0790700506", "B0002G2B2W", "6305576173", "B000059HCI", "B00008X5J1", "0792837797", "B00000J2KZ", "6300267881", "6301977742", "6300216713", "6300269132", "B00000I1DI", "6302783356", "6300214826", "6305095566", "B00005JLET", "6302054982", "0800103106", "6302201845", "6302798450", "B00000J2L7", "6304994540", "6303686796", "B00005PJ8I", "6300216500", "0783228317", "6303107338", "6304935811", "B00004W5UA", "6302610702", "0783246641", "6300183211", "6302921058", "0792842111", "B00004T37H", "B00002E285", "B00003CXE6", "B000007OY0", "6301971582", "6300184064", "B00005LL26", "0790736039"], "bought_together": ["0790734079", "0790705141"], "also_viewed": ["0393312836", "0790705141", "B0013FSXT6", "B00GGAK0FS", "B008RO875Q", "B004O724M2", "B00004TLMC", "B00023NRSM", "B008M4MB8K", "6305440093", "6303953425", "6303939015", "6303148387", "6303861733", "B00003CXB4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 296220}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790701022", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EV1DQCCGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Clockwork Orange"}
{"description": "Irish writer-director Neil Jordan followed up his surprise hitThe Crying Gamewith this controversial biography of IRA leader Michael Collins (Liam Neeson), one of the most important political leaders of the 20th century. The film follows Collins as he matures from guerrilla leader to national hero and statesman. Jordan's take on Collins is that he was set up by Irish president Eamon De Valera (Alan Rickman), who was jealous of Collins's legendary popularity. De Valera puts Collins in the position of negotiating a peace treaty that would never satisfy the Irish hero's hard-core followers. When the IRA leader returns with a first-step compromise, De Valera undercuts Collins's popularity by refusing to support the revised treaty. And the civil war continues for months.Michael Collinsoccasionally loses focus and momentum, but is the kind of exciting historical drama that deserves to be called &quot;sweeping.&quot; It is also one of the most beautifully photographed films in years: cinematographer Chris Menges uses color and texture to set moods and accent emotions. The movie also stars Aidan Quinn, Julia Roberts, and Stephen Rea.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000OCY7JO", "0783227906", "B00005V1WP", "B00008DDHZ", "B000005IQX", "B003498SCQ", "B004TPJN9Q", "B0009G3BCY", "B000AQKV1C", "0783227329", "B00078XGRY", "B000CBG5PQ", "B00000F3FS", "B005SH65G8", "B00000ILEC", "0312295111", "079283366X", "B009YX8MSG", "B00004TJKJ", "B00007K02D", "0767802578", "B004U7MR1Y", "B007UW9W5U", "B004XVMCQ2", "B0002V7SOS", "B003LL3FIY", "0792163087", "B000JYW5AK", "B002U2Q0EG", "B000189LE2", "0767833600", "B00018D3L4", "B005WAP2V0", "B00008DDVT", "B00BJ0OO7A", "B004IY6A0S", "0312294166", "B001ADXX1E", "B004AN0CRO", "1561310700", "B00065GX96", "B005HT404G", "B000002JBE", "0753818523", "B005LAIIRQ", "B002LYD2MG", "6305796297", "B00004W4UB", "1617430277", "B0000714BW", "B003UAKEBW", "B0001I55SI", "B002YMWPUA", "B0038N9X3Q", "B000NOIVT0", "B00DMDSC4S", "B00008PC13", "1573629723", "B000G6ORIE", "0765326930", "B0000EYUBQ", "0783226810", "B000GG4Y32", "B00008UALI", "B00005V5NU", "B0006HBLLY", "1592282822", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B00007K02C", "B0009X75OC", "0449906825", "B003498S2G", "B005WKH3AI", "0230109527", "B00013RC84", "B009YX8LO6", "B00003CXBH", "0316485063", "B000255LIY", "B00004Y87L", "B004A8ZX28", "B00DHN8G3U", "B00008CMRK", "B00005V9HK", "B001A7GODO", "B002XUL6RG", "B00BTYJYR6", "0783241909", "B00J5LXQX8", "B00B0U2SFE", "B00441GZ46", "6305558167", "1597975354", "B000CJ2E5I", "6305428395", "B000R7HY00", "B00005AUKA", "0812570804", "B00664AM02", "B00DL48BM6"], "bought_together": ["B000OCY7JO", "0783227906"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000OCY7JO", "B00005V1WP", "0783227906", "B00004TJKJ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30581}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 35.95, "brand": "NEESON,LIAM", "asin": "0790729407", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QNJ8NQKDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Michael Collins"}
{"description": "Twisterwas a mega-million-dollar blockbuster--helmed by a director (Dutchman Jan de Bont) hot off another scorcher hit (Speed)--that flaunted state-of-the-art digital effects and featured a popular leading actress (Helen Hunt) who would win an Academy Award for her next film (As Good As It Gets). But ask anybody who's seen it and they'll tell you who the real star ofTwisteris: the cow. Not to give anything away, but the cow is one of those inspired little touches (like, say, Bronson Pinchot's career-making cameo inBeverly Hills Cop) that adds a touch of personality to a gigantic Hollywood production. The story is blown out the window after an impressive prologue in which Hunt's character, as a little girl, witnesses her daddy being sucked into a tornado. Basically, Hunt and Bill Paxton are thrill-seeking meteorologists chasing twisters in order to study them (and help warn people of them, of course) with a new technology they've developed. If you thought the Kansas tornado inThe Wizard of Ozwas every bit as scary as the Wicked Witch of the West, then this may be the movie for you.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783225547", "B00E8G5HQE", "B00008G8M4", "B0002V7OI8", "B00000G3PA", "B00005JMXX", "B000P0J0C4", "B0006GANOQ", "B002GIBVVG", "B00AEFXPSK", "6304806434", "B001OFM2TC", "B0045HCJFS", "B0057RCFQS", "0783225733", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000N4RAS8", "B000P0J09W", "6304711891", "B00004Z4WR", "B007STBUHI", "B007SPPANM", "B00E8G5HZ0", "B001OQCV2E", "B0013BM63O", "B00AEFXPMG", "B000QUCRB4", "6305236569", "B000EHSVPK", "B002GHHHKQ", "B000EGDB10", "B00026ZG10", "B000QUU4LY", "B00AEFY4CG", "0800195175", "B001LXIDW2", "0790732149", "1558908315", "B00177YA1K", "B0007PLLBU", "B00003CXFV", "B00081U7HC", "6305212112", "1603800875", "B000JYW5BE", "B0068FZ0O2", "0783235070", "B00003CXTG", "B000FO0AA6", "B000ETRA5U", "B00005JN5E", "B001LXIDVS", "B006VRRGNK", "B0068FZ0GK", "B0013FDM7E", "B00003CXSM", "B00004XPPG", "B000CEV3M8", "6304765266", "B001LXIDVI", "B000QUCQX8", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00393SG1U", "0790730979", "B00AEFXE9U", "B00AEFXXMI", "B000EHSVNW", "0767803434", "B004AOECXI", "B000GRUMPU", "B001ECDVK4", "630471193X", "B00008WFU4", "B005QW98NM", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEBB8NS", "B000SFOW8I", "B00AEFYW64", "B002NZK5V4", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B00008G6E8", "B0045HCJT4", "0783223609", "B00000IQC4", "B00005ATZT", "B00008WFU5", "B00008K76U", "B00AEFY5TI", "B0006FYOTC", "B007IUEE0C", "B00AEFY0F2", "B0002CHK1S", "0783225504", "B001CRC4DG", "B00407PO3W", "B002XUBDRY", "B0000844I8", "0800177258", "B00005JNTI"], "bought_together": ["B00008G8M4", "B00000G3PA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00634MLO0", "B00008G8M4", "B005LAIIPS", "0783225733"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 91188}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790729636", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GW5RZP9SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Twister"}

{"description": "Consciously crafted by director George Stevens as a piece of American mythmaking, Shane is on nearly everyone's shortlist of great movie Westerns. A buckskin knight, Shane (Alan Ladd) rides into the middle of a range war between farmers and cattlemen, quickly siding with the \"sod-busters.\" While helping a kindly farmer (Van Heflin), Shane falls platonically in love with the man's wife (Jean Arthur, in the last screen performance of a marvelous career). Though the showdowns are exciting, and the story simple but involving, what most people will remember about this movie is the friendship between the stoical Shane and the young son of the farmers. The kid is played by Brandon De Wilde, who gives one of the most amazing child performances in the movies; his parting scene with Shane is guaranteed to draw tears from even the most stonyhearted moviegoer. And speaking of stony hearts, Jack Palance made a sensational impression as the evil gunslinger sent to clean house--he has fewer lines of dialogue than he has lines in his magnificently craggy face, but he makes them count. The photography, highlighting the landscape near Jackson Hole, Wyoming, won an Oscar.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["630197705X", "0782008348", "0792106989", "630442972X", "B000056BRF", "630150528X", "B000O599ZS", "6300184951", "6304119038", "6305576173", "6301975987", "6300215962", "0792840836", "6303560040", "6300215741", "6304239149", "6302842263", "B000006N70", "6303854311", "1558802010", "0792838556", "6301325508", "6300215644", "B000M5BRX2", "6304457316", "6304196873", "0783221347", "630266232X", "6302909023", "0783215517", "0790733935", "0792841859", "6302640504", "6300183513", "6300216500", "6301969316", "0790743213", "6303072798", "6300215512", "0800100832", "0800104803", "6301798562", "0790743531", "6303562248", "0767825411", "0792107128", "6303039693", "6303402070", "0783235682", "079284517X", "6300269884", "6304457278", "6301798503", "6301976924", "6301670159", "B00000F13T", "6304071876", "B000M7BEPQ", "6301798759", "0783235593", "6300267938", "6300268748", "1555265952", "6300181340", "6304039530", "6301797957", "B00004RFFA", "6300214567", "6301599225", "6302529441", "B000021Y6K", "6304383169", "0792116887", "6302878535", "6301976622", "079284520X", "6304359705", "0792102320", "B00005R2E1", "6302484421", "1558807780", "6301586026", "0790733897", "6301965957", "0790752395", "6301670140", "6302715555", "0783216084", "6304359721", "6304111398", "6301706587", "6302278929", "6302130379", "6301969049", "6300183580", "6304508611", "B0002IXSVI", "6301971809", "0783235623"], "bought_together": ["630197705X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 87936}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0792107683", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NV73BNF7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Shane [VHS]"}

{"description": "The last film of John Wayne could not have been more fitting, full of details that can't help but make one reflect upon his legacy in the movies and his life as a star. Wayne plays a career gunfighter in the autumn of his life, trying to hang up his pistols after he discovers he's dying of cancer.  Boarding in the house of an attractive widow (Lauren Bacall) and her son (Ron Howard), Wayne's character opts for peace in his final days but is dogged by his reputation when a handful of killers seeks him out for a final fight. Howard is fine as a fatherless boy who needs the strong mentor the hero represents, and James Stewart--who costarred with Wayne in the greatMan Who Shot Liberty Valance--plays the doctor who gives the big man the bad news.

This James Bond is a bit more vulnerable and psychologically complex--and just a shade more politically correct--but he's still a formally attired playboy at heart, with a lovely Russian beauty (Izabella Scorupco) as his sexy ally against a cadre of renegade Russians bent on--what else?--global domination. There's also a seductive villainous with the suggestive name of Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen), and the great actress Judi Dench makes her first appearance as Bond's superior, M, who wisecracks about 007's &quot;dinosaur&quot; status as a globetrotting sexist. All in all, this action-packed Bond adventure provided a much-needed boost the long-running movie series, revitalizing the 007 franchise for the turn of the millennium.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000RPCK1U", "B000NIBURQ", "B001EDVNNU", "B000NDEXPM", "B000M53GMW", "B000RPCK24", "B000RPCK1K", "B000RPCK1A", "B001R10BN2", "B000NIBURG", "B000NIBUR6", "B000M53GN6", "B000M53GLS", "B000NIBUS0", "B000M53GNG", "B000RPCK0Q", "B000NDEXPC", "B000M53GMC", "B00AQSN7HE", "B001PPLIEG", "B00004RG62", "B00004WEJZ", "B007REV4T8", "B00005JL0I", "B008YAPQX4", "B009PN18R2", "B009PN3OD8", "B004BR7XLM", "B00AZFECL8", "0767803434", "6305657947", "B0014Z4ON4", "B004P7CN3G", "B0000BYRO9", "B000SK5Z70", "B000EGDB10", "B00005N5S5", "B000ENC5YW", "B002GHHHME", "B00008K76U", "B00000JQB5", "B000RW3VCK", "B00AEFXKUI", "B0002S94CK", "B0014C2FX8", "B000JYW5BE", "B004LWZW6K", "B0015XHQT4", "B008YAPRBU", "B000ARXF96", "B0014Z4OMU", "6305133476", "B000N3SSBW", "B00026ZG10", "B0000VD12I", "B003XURDAY", "B0046MOVE4", "B00005A3KS", "B0002I84N0", "B000WP07F6", "B0007KZQAM", "0783225547", "B00000BLFI", "B00AEFYBA6", "B00005PJ8S", "B00AVWIQZS", "B00003CXC5", "B00011CZRE", "B00008G8M4", "B004EPYZUS", "B004IK30MI", "079284646X", "B00595W3QK", "B00AEBB8VK", "B00000G3PA", "B000FO0AA6", "B00AEFYDM2", "B008JFUS0U", "B006TTC5WC", "B00008K76W", "B0000BYRO7", "B001FB55HQ", "B000EHSVSC", "B0036TGSR6", "B00EALTW3G", "B002I9Z8BM", "B002GOAH1A", "B00096S4BM", "6304765258", "6304698801", "B000AP04FG", "B00407PNWO", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00005JN2Z", "0790729997", "B00GHH9GXC", "B002ZG98LO", "B000HRMAPE", "0783226012"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000M53GN6", "B000RPCK0Q", "B00I9TDMCM", "B001R10BN2"]}, "price": 12.49, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 255435}, "asin": "079283318X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DZYMD2RDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "GoldenEye (Special Edition)"}

Fonda, feeling isolated while her hawkish husband, Bruce Dern, is away in Vietnam, follows a friend's example and volunteers at a veteran's hospital. There she is reacquainted with Voight, an old friend who has returned from the war as a paraplegic. Lonely and disconnected from her husband, Fonda finds love, and fulfilling sex, with Voight. The sex scenes, very steamy for the time, are still provocative. This mature love story is about expanding your horizons, and is both moving and thoughtful.

{"description": "Bernardo Bertolucci's controversial 1973 film stars Marlon Brando as an expatriate American in Paris reeling from his wife's suicide and entering into a nihilistic sexual relationship with a young woman (Maria Schneider). The film is still shocking, not simply because of its (sometime unconventional) sexual sequences, but because Brando's protagonist needs his liaison with Schneider's character to remain anonymous, an experience not to be shared but indulged on either end. Bertolucci is also operating on subtext here: in a way, Brando's nonengaging engagement is a metaphor for a certain attitude toward directing movies. Jean-Pierre L&eacute;aud costars, but the film is more than anything a vehicle for a great performance by Brando.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783215517"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 597930}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.25, "brand": "", "asin": "0792838343", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71G966CVA9L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Last Tango in Paris (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}

The story finds a reporter (Ellen Barkin) tracking down rumors of an unreleased album by a band whose charismatic leader (Michael Par&eacute;) allegedly died years before. As she approaches surviving members--who have since gone on to other things--she gets different points of view on Eddie's life and artistic drive, and the mystery about that album deepens. The trouble with the film is simple: it's impossible to accept. Michael Par&eacute; is far from suitable to play a Jersey shore rocker with thematic pretensions toward Rimbaud that go back to the '60s, and the soundtrack by John Cafferty sounds like a hack's rendition of E Street Band magic.

{"description": "A movie's lasting value can often be measured by its influence in the  years and  decades following its original release, and on that basisRun Silent, Run Deepis certainly a classic of sorts. It remains one of the seminal World War&nbsp;II submarine  pictures, and its intelligent script and tautly executed action are clearly echoed in such  later submarine dramas asDas Bootand especiallyCrimson Tide,  which borrows liberally from this 1958 film.In one of his best and final roles (he appeared in only four films after this), Clark Gable plays a submarine captain without a command, having been saddled  with a desk job after his previous ship was destroyed due to his overzealous pursuit  of the enemy in dangerous Japanese waters. He finally gets another boat--this time  with a vigilant first officer (Burt Lancaster), who stands poised to assume command if  Gable puts his crew in unnecessary danger. The tension and mutual respect between  these two principled men is superbly written and directed (Robert Wise was just two  years away from his triumph withWest Side Story), and the crucial inclusion  of a strong supporting cast (including Jack Warden and Don Rickles) enhances the  movie's compelling authenticity. Based on a novel by former submarine commander  Edward&nbsp;L. Beach,Run Silent, Run Deepis rousing entertainment with the  added benefit of paying honorable tribute to the men who navigated through the most  frightening and claustrophobic channels of the Pacific theater.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001NBMH6", "B0001WTWWE", "B00005JN9P", "B0001NBMGC", "B000E5N6KW", "B00008AOTR", "B000NTPG6Q", "B000NO1XJA", "B0001FGC1U", "B00005N5S3", "B00AEFYBA6", "B004VGHF7K", "B000O599Z8", "B000O78L0U", "B00096S4B2", "B00096S4BM", "B0000AMRUP", "B00005PJ8K", "B004R6EF9U", "B005HQBO9I", "0767802470", "B00008AOTO", "0792841662", "B00AEFXLKC", "B0007TKNGA", "B0009XRZI8", "B0001NBMHQ", "B00003CXHJ", "B000EHSVSC", "B0015S2OWI", "B000NTPG5W", "B000EMGJFE", "B00005B1YF", "B00005B1YH", "B0038EG20W", "B000062XEX", "B00005OSJQ", "B000O599VC", "B00AEFYENK", "B000FZETR0", "B00005ASGB", "B004TPJN3C", "B00005PJ8L", "B0001FVDIC", "B0001NBMI0", "B00K6J7Q1Q", "B00005PJ8S", "B00008DDGW", "B004GSVXBW", "B00008V6Y1", "B004176JJY", "B003AWRMCO", "B00004XPPC", "B0002TSZHY", "B0006B2A42", "B000MGTQ7K", "B00008MTY1", "6304765258", "0782010040", "B00008R9M6", "0792839730", "B000A2WJBQ", "B000H1RFSM", "B000MGTQ7U", "B00008K76U", "B0005C9MQ6", "B000U1ZV6M", "B0007TKNLU", "B000NTPG5M", "B00IJZW3QW", "B00008R9M5", "B00CHYSSME", "B000EHSVS2", "B000CNESN0", "B00BFWKE62", "B000MGBLIC", "B00143XE0U", "0792838408", "B00005N5S2", "B00008AOTM", "B0029778T8", "B000O599N0", "B0001FVDH8", "B004QSQMPE", "B00E8G5HZ0", "B000E0WJN2", "B004U7EIES", "B00BX8PG4S", "B003B3NV5E", "B0002S94G6", "0792843576", "B000EHSVV4", "B000F7CMQ8", "B005DTZXPA", "B000O78L00", "B0009ML2JC", "0792844017", "B004IFYMXE", "B0014CCPP6", "B002GHHHPQ"], "bought_together": ["B0001NBMH6", "B0001WTWWE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0045HCJSA", "B00005N90X", "B0012YYZTK", "B00097DY2A"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 25761}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 25.0, "brand": "GABLE/LANCASTER", "asin": "0792841670", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71FX265SKNL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Run Silent, Run Deep"}
{"description": "Based on Thomas Harris's novel, this terrifying film by Jonathan Demme really only contains a couple of genuinely shocking moments (one involving an autopsy, the other a prison break). The rest of the film is a splatter-free visual and psychological descent into the hell of madness, redeemed astonishingly by an unlikely connection between a monster and a haunted young woman. Anthony Hopkins is extraordinary as the cannibalistic psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter, virtually entombed in a subterranean prison for the criminally insane. At the behest of the FBI, agent-in-training Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) approaches Lecter, requesting his insights into the identity and methods of a serial killer named Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine). In exchange, Lecter demands the right to penetrate Starling's most painful memories, creating a bizarre but palpable intimacy that liberates them both under separate but equally horrific circumstances. Demme, a filmmaker with a uniquely populist vision (Melvin and Howard,Something Wild), also spent his early years making pulp for Roger Corman (Caged Heat), and he hasn't forgotten the significance of tone, atmosphere, and the unsettling nature of a crudely effective close-up. Much of the film, in fact, consists of actors staring straight into the camera (usually from Clarice's point of view), making every bridge between one set of eyes to another seem terribly dangerous.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005LKIM", "6302054982", "B00008AOS5", "B00005PJ8I", "B000007OY0", "6302800420", "0790705141", "B00003CXE6", "6301179552", "6301427076", "B000003KHS", "6300989003", "6303402348", "B0000633ZP", "B00005ATQA"], "bought_together": ["6302054982"], "also_viewed": ["6305363668", "6302415853", "0792116887", "079213690X", "0800103106", "6305750750"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 331980}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0792842111", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4117Q86BS0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Silence of the Lambs [VHS]"}

{"description": "Early on inRobocop 3, an action figure of our metal hero on the nightstand in a little girl's room informs us that he's now become a children's toy. The image is right on the money; despite following up two of the most violent, hilarious sci-fi/action films ever made,Robocop&nbsp;3is strictly for the kiddies. It's not just that the gore  has been toned down considerably to make for a PG-13 rating; also excised is the straight-faced portrait of a world run by corporate fascism. When evil corporation OCP, and its even more evil Japanese parent company, plan to raze a Detroit neighborhood to put up the shining new Delta City, the residents (including the aforementioned adolescent, who conveniently happens to be a computer expert) gang up to fight back, just like the angry neighbors inDeath Wish&nbsp;V. Robocop (played this time out by Robert John Burke, Peter Weller having wisely passed) could be a hindrance to the companies' plans, so a ninja android is sent in to deal with him. Even all this could have been enjoyable, in a campy sort of way, but nothing pays off as either comedy or action--tellingly, the two big showdowns with the ninja start exhilaratingly (Robocop's clunky movements hilariously counterpoised by the android's acrobatic leaps), only to end just when they're getting good. Director Fred Dekker has some nice stylistic touches scattered about, but not nearly enough to save the film. One high note, though: The animated \"Johnny Rehab\" spot may be the funniest ad in the whole series.--Bruce Reid", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301794982", "6300213005", "6304844948", "B00005N7Z1", "6301961404"], "bought_together": ["6301794982", "6300213005"]}, "price": 10.97, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 584665}, "asin": "0792845757", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5134MPYWFJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Robocop 3 [VHS]"}

Dripping with blood, social satire and \"sick, sick comedy\" (The Film Daily) this film, according to critic Leonard Maltin, \"nicely captures the spirit of the beatnik era\" and zips along with vibes of counterculture creepiness.Walter (Dick Miller) is a busboy overly impressed with the cool cats who hang out at The Yellow Doorcoffee house, and he wonders how to become \"hip.\" When he accidentally kills his landlady's pet cat, Walter panics and covers it with clay. His prayers are answered, and before he knows it he's the \"cat's meow\" of the art world. His talent develops and - surprise! - he can sculpt humans the same way too.

{"description": "The legendary distance runner Steve Prefontaine blazed across tracks and into America's consciousness before meeting a tragic death in an auto accident at the age of 24.  In this tribute to \"Pre,\" narrated by writer Ken Kesey, a number of his contemporaries speak movingly of him as an athlete and a person.  After setting high school running records in his native Oregon, Prefontaine went on to the University of Oregon, where as a freshman he began to dominate the American track scene and appeared on the cover ofSports Illustrated. He was a distinctive character and archival films demonstrate the charisma and astounding confidence he brought to his sport.  His race in the 5,000 meters at the 1972 Munich Olympics is shown in detail, with other runners in the race offering commentary on the gutsy performance of the 21-year-old.  Pre didn't win a medal in the race, but as his sister puts it, the race \"matured him\" and made him determined to win gold at the 1976 Montreal Olympics (which he wouldn't live to do).  Though one of the world's best athletes, after college he was forced to survive on food stamps, and he became a spokesman for the plight of amateur athletes. This is a touching look at a brilliant athlete and a charming character who still inspires runners today.--Robert J.

{"description": "Hit man Martin Q. Blank (John Cusack) is in an awkward situation. Several of them, actually. He's attending his high school reunion on an assignment; he's got a rival hit man (Dan Aykroyd) on his tail; and he's going to have to explain to his old girlfriend (Minnie Driver) why he stood her up on prom night. This amiable black comedy, cowritten by Cusack and directed by Jonathan Demme prot&eacute;g&eacute; George Armitage (Miami Blues), has the feel of Demme'sSomething WildandMarried to the Mob--which is to say its humor is dark and brightly colored at the same time. Cusack and Driver are utterly charming--as is the leading man's sister, Joan, who plays his secretary. (Ms. Cusack received an Oscar nomination for her next role, inIn & Out.) Alan Arkin is also very funny as Martin's psychiatrist.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CXGA", "B00009OWJY", "B0015XHQVC", "B004SIP9RO", "B00005JKFA", "B002JOUNE8", "B004YCKKFK", "B000065U1Q", "B00005JPT0", "B000BNX3B4", "B00000IQBW", "B000001FJL", "B00005U5AG", "B00BNH9NCU", "B00008K77D", "B001HVZOB6", "B0013D8LBS", "B000P0I4O4", "B003ASLJQ8", "B000DZ7YN8", "B00AADAK5W", "B004SIP7ZS", "0780618548", "B00003CY5G", "B00014NEZI", "B00008DDXK", "B00AEFXE9U", "B000TJ6PBK", "B002ZG97XI", "B00007AJF8", "0767802519", "B00008EY9G", "6305428239", "6305236569", "B0009X7BDC", "B002FU8IWU", "B007P9HW3M", "B000GGSMC6", "B000065V3H", "B00GHJ1YUI", "B004ZNFTDQ", "B000ELL1SA", "6305428034", "B000093FLA", "B0045HCJFS", "B0015XHQUI", "6304698747", "6305428050", "0783229364", "B00006JDVV", "B000274T94", "B000065V3E", "B00008OE4W", "B000053VB4", "B00016MSV2", "B00005V9I0", "B00005JKBC", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B003ASLJPE", "B009YQJ322", "0767812182", "B0000B1OFL", "B004SIP8LG", "B00008975Z", "B00003CY41", "B0029XFN9Y", "B0049IHX2C", "B00005V4XW", "B00AEFXO8Q", "6305263248", "B00BTYJYOY", "B002AS466O", "0767821513", "6304806434", "B002NZK5R8", "B00AEBB9DW", "B002O3Z4VG", "B0000A02TZ", "B00BTYFWEA", "0792846435", "B004CQZFIU", "B00004XPPB", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00026ZG10", "B00AG475K8", "B0000A9GHD", "B004WCTLNY", "B002ZG96ZC", "B00DW5IJR6", "B00009Y3PV", "B002WEEYIQ", "B0012KJ0DK", "B0000524E5", "0767817729", "076782153X", "B000PAAJZ6", "B0007IO6NM", "B00AEFXWXI", "B00AG473GE", "B0010YSD8Q"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXGA", "B00005JKFA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CXGA", "B000QUU4MI", "B002JOUNE8", "B00005JKFA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8109}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "Buena Vista", "asin": "1558908382", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51gX6Vb2znL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Grosse Pointe Blank"}

{"description": "Arguably the worst movie that our lovable pals Joel, Crow, and Tom Servo have ever had the pain of  watching,Manos: Hands of Fateis destined to be anMST3Kclassic for this very reason. Not only is  there a sparse, illogical plot, but the cinematography is nonsensical (note Servo's point about the endless countryside  ride in Texas). That said,Manosmust be watched, and cringed at, and commented on by its viewers because of  the director's amazingly awful vision of what a horror film should be. What plot there is involves a vacationing family  being trapped in a remote ranch house in the desert that's \"managed\" by a greasy, what looks to be stoned, oversize  bow-legged keeper named \"Torgo.\" As the movie goes on, and one finds the \"master\" and his harem of semi-dead  women clad in see-through white dresses, one wonders more and more what the hell this movie was supposed to be  about. Even Dr.&nbsp;Forrester and Frank feel a little sorry for Joel and the boys' being forced to watch this one. Still,  you'll find yourself spiraling into hysterics when the women get into a big catty brawl while Joel and the boys liken  their antics to a Ladies Guild performingA Midsummer Night's Dreamor female dirt-wrestling.

{"description": "Clint Eastwood (making his very assured directorial debut) is a poetry-spouting stud-muffin DJ stalked by a maniacally amorous fan after a misguided one-night stand in this enjoyably schlocky, undeniably effective film about good intentions gone murderously wacky. Although many of thevery'70s trappings presented here may ultimately be too dated to be taken seriously (including a very self-indulgent jazz number and a hilariously gooey seduction number between Eastwood and Donna Mills), the core premise of infatuation taken out of bounds remains uncomfortably plausible--and was influential enough to be appropriated by one of the biggest hits of the '80s. (Here's a hint--it starred Michael Douglas, Glenn Close, and a very unfortunate bunny rabbit). A well-staged and occasionally very frightening thriller worth watching for Jessica Walter's peerlessly unhinged performance alone.

{"description": "When Universal Pictures picked up the movie rights to a Broadway adaptation ofDracula, they felt secure in handing the property over to the sinister team of actor Lon Chaney and director Tod Browning. But Chaney died of cancer, and Universal hired the Hungarian who had scored a success in the stage play: B&eacute;la Lugosi. The resulting film launched both Lugosi's baroque career and the horror-movie cycle of the 1930s. It gets off to an atmospheric start, as we meet Count Dracula in his shadowy castle in Transylvania, superbly captured by the great cinematographer Karl Freund. Eventually Dracula and his blood-sucking devotee (Dwight Frye, in one of the cinema's truly mad performances) meet their match in a vampire-hunter called Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan). If the later sections of the film are undeniably stage bound and a tad creaky, Dracula nevertheless casts a spell, thanks to Lugosi's creepily lugubrious manner and the eerie silences of Browning's directing style. (After a mood-enhancing snippet ofSwan Lakeunder the opening titles, there is no music in the film.)Frankenstein, which was released a few months later, confirmed the horror craze, and Universal has been making money (and countless spin-off projects) from its twin titans of terror ever since. Certainly the role left a lasting impression on the increasingly addled and drug-addicted Lugosi, who was never quite able to distance himself from the part that made him a star. He was buried, at his request, in his black vampire cape.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300183084", "6300181286", "6300183092", "6300183629", "6302120101", "630252542X", "6302843219", "6300185443", "6302526167", "6301005783", "6301257014", "6302841771", "6302526175", "6303257801", "6302841763", "6302843227", "6300185281", "6300181820", "630284178X", "0783235607", "6302526191", "6302526140", "6302841844", "6300181340", "6301967410", "0783222955", "6302526086", "630018529X", "6304507348", "6302526051", "B00007JME0", "0783240961", "B00AEBB8VK", "630252587X", "6302526094", "6300247589", "B002VWNIAY", "6303626424", "6302843200", "6305576173", "630266232X", "6301327845", "6300215539", "6303402070", "6300182983", "6302309751", "5554306004", "6302841798", "0790705141", "630214227X", "630281474X"], "bought_together": ["6300181286", "6300183092"], "also_viewed": ["6300181286", "6300183629", "6300183092", "6300183084", "6302526175", "6300185281", "6302843219", "630252542X", "6302526140", "6302120101", "B00L8QP0VY", "6302843197", "630018529X", "6302526086", "6302841763", "630252587X", "6302841771", "6302526167", "6300185443", "B00000JMOF", "B00000K14A", "630312917X", "6302843200", "6300214087", "B0001HAGTM", "B008FL8OTK", "B000WNHTCC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 228201}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6300181278", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51588FFRK0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dracula [VHS]"}

This is one of the definitive Pacino performances, along with his role as Michael Corleone in theGodfathersaga, and Sonny the bungling bank robber inDog Day Afternoon(which reunited him with his Serpico director, Sidney Lumet)--and Pacino was nominated for a best actor Oscar for all of them (although he wouldn't actually win until 1992'sScent of a Woman).--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790733927", "6301798503", "630018627X", "0790734079", "630300394X", "6300181405", "6304935811", "6302289017", "0783222955"], "bought_together": ["0790733927"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 281672}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.79, "brand": "", "asin": "6300216543", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/210TZHT56VL.jpg", "title": "Serpico [VHS]"}

Still, it compares favorably to the overly long, TV mini-series starring Pierce Brosnan and Eric Idle.Elegant David Niven plays the neurotically punctual Phileas Fogg, a British gent who is spurned on by a wager to prove he can travel around the world in 80 days. He is accompanied by his valet, played with persnickety humor by Cantinflas.Nominated for several Academy Awards, this was written by John Farrow (Mia's dad) and S.J. Perelman, based on Jules Verne's 1873 classic. The fun part is the razzle-dazzle. Todd knew what he was doing with all those exotic locales and over 40 cameo appearances, including Charles Boyer, Ronald Colman, Marlene Dietrich, Jos&eacute; Greco, Peter Lorre, Buster Keaton, Frank Sinatra, and Red Skelton.

{"description": "This harrowing but rewarding 1984 drama concerns the real-life relationship between New York Times reporter Sidney Schanberg and his Cambodian assistant Dith Pran (Haing S. Ngor), the latter left at the mercy of the Khmer Rouge after Schanberg--who chose to stay after American evacuation but was booted out--failed to get him safe passage. Filmmaker Roland Joff&eacute;, previously a documentarist, made his feature debut with this account of Dith's rocky survival in the ensuing madness of the Khmer Rouge's genocidal campaign. The script spends some time with Schanberg's feelings of guilt after the fact, but most of the movie is a shattering re-creation of hell on Earth. The late Haing S.

{"description": "This gorgeous adaptation of Lucy Maud Montgomery's classicchildren's storyis well worth watching with the whole family. Produced for Canadian television, it's one of those rare productions that actually sticks to the book and even enhances it through first-rate performances and an excellent script. Set on bucolic Prince Edward Island in the late 19th century,Anne of Green Gablesis the story of Anne Shirley, an imaginative and headstrong  orphan. When brother and sister Marilla and Mathew Cuthbert decide to adopt an orphan boy to help Matthew work the farm, they are astonished when Anne arrives at the train station by mistake. \"What use is she to us?\" grumbles the gruff Marilla.  \"We might be of some use to her,\" answers Matthew, who has taken an instant liking to the talkative Anne.  As Anne grows up, her adventures are both hilarious and moving. It's a delight to watch as she forms a friendship with the beautiful Diana and her admirer--the dashing Gilbert Blythe--then dyes her hair green, cracks a slate over Gilbert's head when he calls her \"Carrots,\" and finds a sympathetic teacher who encourages her to attend college.Richard Farnsworth is perfect as the shy and gentle bachelor Matthew, who confides to Anne that he never went courting because \"I would have had to say something.\" Colleen Dewhurst delivers a nuanced and powerful performance as Marilla, a seemingly cold-hearted spinster whose no-nonsense exterior conceals a warm heart. And as Anne, Megan Follows strikes the perfect note, maturing from freckle-faced orphan to elegant and poised young woman.--Elisabeth Keating", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301539354", "B00005O0ST", "1558906509", "B00005Y7AM", "6304117752", "B00005Y7AN", "0788812408", "6304400551", "078881172X", "6305123616", "B00005RRG5", "0788812807", "6305940932", "B003JLL2RW", "B000LC4ZBC", "B00007JMF2", "6301465598", "630339860X", "B00000F3QZ"], "bought_together": ["6301539354", "B00005O0ST"], "also_viewed": ["B0007NMHNS", "B00005Y7AN", "6301539354", "B00005O0ST", "B006ZUMNGS", "B00005Y7AM", "B001123BDY", "0553609416", "B001TD73OI", "B00020A1MU", "1558906428", "6300213668", "055321313X", "6303314015", "B000FSLMFO", "B008LG0GJA", "6304117752", "6301792734", "630339860X", "B00AEFXMGU", "0553213148", "0486283666", "6304401132", "1558906509", "B000085EF8", "0788812408", "B0000AQZYM", "6305212112", "6305613532", "B00007JMF3", "6304274742", "6304400551", "6304143184"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 50532}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "Walt Disney Home Video", "asin": "6300277089", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CM9X9GV2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Anne of Green Gables [VHS]"}

{"description": "Writer-director Preston Sturges's third feature, 1941'sSullivan's Travels, remains the antic auteur's most ambitious screen effort. Having added the producer's stripe to his duties, Sturges combines breezy romantic comedy, arch Hollywood satire, and social essay into a single, screwball story line.The titular pilgrim is John L. Sullivan (Joel McCrea), an Ivy League grad who's enjoyed a meteoric rise as the director behind escapist movies likeAnts in Your Pants of 1938, but is now determined to raise his sights toward more exalted, serious-minded cinematic art. His proposed breakthrough, portentously titledO Brother, Where Art Thou?, elicits a studio response closer to \"Oh, brother,\" given the director's utter lack of first-hand experience on the wrong side of the tracks.Instead of capitulating, Sullivan sets off disguised as a tramp, ready to meet life's crueler lessons face-to-face--albeit followed at a discreet distance by a motor home filled with studio handlers and reporters. His ludicrous odyssey may give the boy director no real insight, but it gives Sturges the chance to inject some reliably fine gags and a romantic subplot featuring the luminous Veronica Lake. It's at this juncture that Sturges the writer's darker objective throws a jolting shift in tone. Suffice it to say that just when a comic, upbeat denouement seems imminent, Sullivan travels instead from the sunlit California of the comedy's early reels toward a darker, relentlessly downbeat world influenced more by the social realism of the movies the hero desperately wants to make. By the final reel, Sturges has flirted with real tragedy, turning his conclusion into a meditation on his own seemingly carefree, dizzily comic art.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001ZMXAY", "1558802010", "6300270068", "6301586034", "6300185125", "630196585X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 282671}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6301232291", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41QKDMDZGKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sullivan's Travels [VHS]"}

{"description": "Rebeccais an ageless, timeless adult movie about a woman who marries a widower but fears she lives in the shadow of her predecessor. This was Hitchcock's first American feature, and it garnered the Best Picture statue at the 1941 Academy Awards. In today's films, most twists and surprises are ridiculous or just gratuitous, so it's sobering to look back on this film where every revelation not only shocks, but makes organic sense with the story line. Laurence Olivier is dashing and weak, fierce and cowed. Joan Fontaine is strong yet submissive, defiant yet accommodating.

Everyone seems to think that Jacob McCandles is six-feet under (\"I thought you was dead\" is a running line throughout), so some bad men kidnap his grandson.

Richard Boone makes a worthy adversary to Jake's larger than life figure, and the final confrontation between the two contains some great gritted-teeth dialogue.

{"description": "A project developed by the late Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut but left  unrealized by him after his death,The Little Thiefwas completed by French filmmaker Claude Miller (The Accompanist) and partially revised in script form by several writers. The result is a slight hodgepodge of story ideas about an adolescent girl (a strong performance by Charlotte Gainsbourg) intrigued by adult mysteries, anxious to lose her virginity, and dabbling in petty crimes until she is caught by the law. After a somewhat rocky first act, the film settles into a strong groove and begins to feel very much like Truffaut in his prime. The poignant and witty (if somewhat abrupt) introduction of the idea of the heroine rediscovering the world through a camera lens--and being saved from her wayward existence by the discovery--can't help but make fans of the New Wave pioneer misty-eyed.

{"description": "Director Sam Fuller's biggest success of its time (and, superficially at least, his most conventional film) is the 1953 noir effortPickup on South Street. Candy (Jean Peters) has her purse picked on the subway by small-time thief and ex-con Skip (Richard Widmark), neither of them realizing that the purse contains microfilm bound for Communist spies and that they are being watched the whole time by Federal agents. The New York police and the Feds catch up with Skip and try to cajole him into turning over the microfilm, but as he's one of Fuller's \"outsider\" antihero protagonists, the patriotic angle cuts no ice with him. He plays both sides against the middle when he finds out that the Communists are involved, hoping to make a big score off the deal, but eventually he comes around when he realizes that he's smitten with Candy. Finally Skip plays ball with the authorities, but is it out of his love for both his friend Moe and Candy, or is he swayed by the patriotic urgings of the FBI, or does it just come from some inner core of decency? You decide. When Skip is asked, \"Do you know what treason is?\" he smirks, \"Who cares?\"; when the Feds try to appeal to his patriotism, he sneers through several layers of Sinatra cool, \"Are you waving the flag at me?\"Pickupis set almost entirely in the garbage-strewn alleys, grimy subways, seedy waterfront dives, and gloomy streets of New York City; it's marked by extremely lengthy takes and fluid, mobile camera work. The closing scene when Skip tracks down another character in the subway and administers a brutal beating to him is one of the more violent scenes you'll find in '50s film noir.--Jerry Renshaw", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001CC7PM6", "6305999872", "B000BDH6DU", "B000B8384Q", "B001BZQMFA", "B0035Q636Q", "1558807780", "6301979680", "6301258002", "6301491920", "6304212135", "6301640667", "6302801133"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 361183}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.95, "brand": "", "asin": "630196697X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P25T8QY6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pickup on South Street [VHS]"}

{"description": "The dark urban world ofThe Asphalt Jungleis one of the essential destinations in film noir, but be warned: despite tough guy Sterling Hayden's dreams of bucolic escape, there is no way out. John Huston directed this superbly calibrated crime classic, which displays his usual wry appreciation of fringies and down-and-outers. This time the task for Huston's eccentric ensemble is a jewel robbery, which--this being a Huston film--can't possibly work out as well as its plan. The cast includes Sam Jaffee, indelible as a criminal mastermind, and the pre-stardom Marilyn Monroe. Hayden plays the kind of mug he would revisit in Stanley Kubrick'sThe Killing, which is an informal homage to this film. And the film's look is definitive: both artful and gritty, it creates a noir landscape that traps its people just as surely as the tar pits trapped the dinosaurs.

{"description": "Kevin Costner as a warped serial killer, a pillar of the community whose dark side is embodied by an on-screen William Hurt? You have to admit, it sounds intriguing, right?Mr. Brooksis the vehicle for this unsavory story, and it turns out to be a lot less kicky than it sounds. Mr. Brooks is a Portland, Oregon tycoon and philanthropist whose \"addiction\" to murder is suddenly re-surfacing--with plenty of help from his sneering alter ego, who generally sits in the back of the car, goading Mr. Brooks on. (The other characters can't see William Hurt in all this, of course.) The unbelievably convoluted plot has Mr. Brooks confronted by a blackmailer (comedian Dane Cook) who has a surprising twist on things, and trailed by a cop (Demi Moore) who comes equipped with her own set of professional and marital woes. As if that weren't enough, when Brooks's daughter (Danielle Panabaker) comes home, it becomes clear that some traits run in the family.The scenes with Costner and Hurt are the best stuff in the film, even if director Bruce Evans can't figure out how to play fair visualizing their presence to others. But the script, which among other whoppers make Demi Moore's character a millionaire, is just too unbelievable to stomach.

{"description": "In the entire history of American movies,The Night of the Hunterstands out as the rarest and most exotic of specimens. It is, to say the least, a masterpiece--and not just because it was the only movie directed by flamboyant actor Charles Laughton or the only produced solo screenplay by the legendary critic James Agee (who also cowroteThe African Queen). The truth is, nobody has ever made anything approaching its phantasmagoric, overheated style in which German expressionism, religious hysteria, fairy-tale fantasy (of the Grimm-est variety), and stalker movie are brought together in a furious boil. Like a nightmarish premonition of stalker movies to come,Night of the Huntertells the suspenseful tale of a demented preacher (Robert Mitchum, in a performance that prefigures his memorable villain inCape Fear), who torments a boy and his little sister--even marries their mixed-up mother (Shelley Winters)--because he's certain the kids know where their late bank-robber father hid a stash of stolen money. So dramatic, primal, and unforgettable are its images--the preacher's shadow looming over the children in their bedroom, the magical boat ride down a river whose banks teem with fantastic wildlife, those tattoos of LOVE and HATE on the unholy man's knuckles, the golden locks of a drowned woman waving in the current along with the indigenous plant life in her watery grave--that they're still haunting audiences (and filmmakers) today.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["1558808590", "6301976126", "0784011451", "0792101448", "6304212151", "1558807780", "B000003NDA", "6301966430", "6301491920", "B00000F6MH", "6304366035", "6302226899", "0790743159", "6302413435", "6301586026", "0790741431", "6300208133", "6304429274", "0783217528", "6301797906", "6301798732", "0800100832", "B000GX7MMA", "B000054OW2", "6301977815", "B000056BRF", "B0000048YO", "B001E419N8", "630266232X", "6301978110", "6302968100", "6305237115", "6301564456", "0782008348", "0792115449", "6302353785", "6301964012", "630150528X"], "bought_together": ["1558808590"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 201324}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6301973232", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/717SP3TYNML._SY300_.gif", "title": "Night of the Hunter [VHS]"}

{"description": "Lance Henriksen plays Torquemada, the Grand Inquisitor of the infamous Spanish Inquisition, which is in full swing when THE PIT AND THE PENDULUM begins. The heretic-burning fires of the Auto da f are raging all across Spain, the people live in fear, and no one dares speak a word against Torquemada and the Inquisition. But when a baker's wife tries to stop a woman from being burned alive, she is arrested and brought before the evil Torquemada. The mad dictator accuses her of being a witch and commands that she be put on trial, tortured into a confession, and then burned at the stake. The beautiful woman can only hope that her husband will rescue her before she is killed. Director Stuart Gordon offers up another smart, ambitious horror film in THE PIT AND THE PENDULUM, which is loosely based on the classic Edgar Allan Poe story. Resisting obvious horror film tropes, Gordon laces his film with a more internal brand of horror, focusing on the tortures of the soul and the evil that men do to themselves as well as others. Henriksen is chilling as the half-crazed Torquemada, creating a character who has been twisted by the conflicting forces of devotion to God, earthly lust, and ambitions of power. Excellent acting, a well-crafted script, and good production design make THE PIT AND THE PENDULUM a unique horror film, typical of Gordon's work.", "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 80213}, "asin": "6302054257", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21EWBSAKVVL.jpg", "title": "Pit &amp; the Pendulum [VHS]"}
{"description": "This 1991 thriller by Joseph Ruben (True Believer) works up to a point: Julia Roberts plays an abused wife who fakes her death and starts anew under a different identity in Iowa. Her psychopathic husband (Patrick Bergin) figures it out and stalks her and her new boyfriend (Kevin Anderson). The best part of the film is the moody isolation of Roberts's life with Bergin. Ruben ingeniously stakes out the story by presenting what looks like an ideal life between the two--a nice house on the ocean, a seemingly healthy sex life, etc.--and then, whammo! Vital to the plot but less interesting is everything afterward, but that's less an inherent script problem than it is obvious studio pressure to push Roberts as a cute star. There's even a sequence where the actress tries on a series of hats while Van Morrison's \"Brown Eyed Girl\" plays on the soundtrack. Such insistent valentines to Roberts destroys most of Ruben's momentum and the film's credibility, and the project never quite recovers.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302450187", "B00006HB0E"], "bought_together": ["6302450187"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 306497}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.98, "brand": "", "asin": "6302096227", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41H2PMRYGHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sleeping With the Enemy [VHS]"}

As the despondent husband advertises all over France and Holland for his missing wife, this game of cat-and-mouse escalates into a strategy of psychological horror, revealing certain facts and merely suggesting others to create an intense atmosphere of dread and anticipation. A film that Alfred Hitchcock would certainly have admired,The Vanishingleads to an unforgettable conclusion that's sure to send chills down your spine.

{"description": "The oily allure of underground power is compelling. During the heyday of New York's mob scene, it was more than a mysterious, dynamic draw, it was a ticket out of poverty and stepping stone to notoriety. Based on the novel by E.L. Doctorow,Billy Bathgateis the story of a street-smart boy (Loren Dean) who, after a chance encounter with racketeering kingpin Dutch Schultz (Dustin Hoffman), sets out to apprentice himself to the Mafia and ride the roller-coaster life of a gangster.Central to the story development is the idea of fate and circumstance. Except for Billy, who is merely a criminal voyeur, all the characters play out the hand they were dealt, good or bad, live or die. Moving from misunderstood businessman, struggling to legitimize his line of work, to a steely, vengeful egomaniac, Dustin Hoffman gives a powerful performance. The role of Schultz is so strong, however, that Hoffman overpowers the cast, leaving some characters underdeveloped. Despite being the movie's namesake, Billy always seems a bit vacuous and leaves the audience wondering if he appreciates and values his luck. Bo Widerberg, played by Bruce Willis, is a slick gangster with a weasely demeanor and Drew Preston (Nicole Kidman), the girl to be fought over. Although Kidman's performance isn't her most memorable, she does a good job in balancing and evolving her character amid all the gunslinging and testosterone of the mob. If you're a Hoffman fan, and like gangster flicks, this movie's for you.--Jeff Leinaweaver", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 472680}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.45, "brand": "", "asin": "6302320429", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41D0WQ0A4ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Billy Bathgate [VHS]"}

Clifton James, the redneck sheriff fromLive and Let Die, makes an embarrassing and ill-advised appearance as a racist tourist who briefly teams up with 007 in what is otherwise the film's highlight, a high-energy chase through the crowded streets of Bangkok that climaxes with a breathtaking midair corkscrew jump.

{"description": "Fred Zinnemann's epic drama is a splendid showcase for Audrey Hepburn, who stars as the young nun Sister Luke, who is deeply spiritual yet conflicted about whether or not she can conform to convent life. Though the film is a mesmerizing--and quite leisurely--two and a half hours, its plot is fairly simple--young Gabrielle (Hepburn) enters the convent pledging her life to God, learns the disciplines associated with the life, receives her dream assignment of going to the Congo as a missionary nurse, and once there, is forced to face whether she is meant for the rigorous life of poverty, chastity, and most difficult of all, obedience. The film does a marvelous job of portraying the challenges of cloistered life without being either off-putting or overly romantic. And Hepburn, sometimes with only her eyes, communicates all the drive, faith, and conflict of a young woman so torn.--Anne Hurley", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300251152", "6302878527", "6300215741"], "bought_together": ["6300251152"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 287036}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.57, "brand": "", "asin": "6302636779", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51V843DC4YL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Nun's Story [VHS]"}

Mankiewicz made this clever story about three wives who spend an afternoon  at a children's picnic mulling over a letter all three had just received,  from a woman who says she's just run off with one of their husbands. As  the wives--a former farm girl (Jeanne Crain), a radio soap opera writer  (Ann Sothern), and a social climber from the wrong side of the tracks  (Linda Darnell)--mull over the troubles of their marriages, each begins to  think that she's the one left behind.A Letter to Three Wivesdoesn't have the crackling show-biz milieu ofEve, but it has the  same mix of snappy dialogue and topnotch performances. The tone ranges  from florid sentiment to unblinking cynicism, yet Mankiewicz holds it all  together with smooth, witty direction.

{"description": "Like moths to a flame, great actors gravitate to the singular genius of playwright-screenwriter David Mamet, who updated his Pulitzer Prize-winning play for this all-star screen adaptation. The material is not inherently cinematic, so the movie's greatest asset is Mamet's peerless dialogue and the assembly of a once-in-a-lifetime cast led by Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, and Alec Baldwin (the last in a role Mamet created especially for the film). Often regarded as a critique of the Reagan administration's impact on the American economy, the play and film focus on a competitive group of real estate salesmen who've gone from feast to famine in a market gone cold. When an executive \"motivator\" (Alec Baldwin) demands a sales contest among the agents in the cramped office, the stakes are critically high: any agent who fails to meet his quota of sales \"leads\" (i.e., potential buyers) will lose his job. This intense ultimatum is a boon for the office superstar (Pacino), but a once-successful salesman (Lemmon) now finds himself clinging nervously to faded glory. Political and personal rivalries erupt under pressure when the other agents (Alan Arkin, Ed Harris) suspect the office manager (Kevin Spacey) of foul play. This cauldron of anxiety, tension, and sheer desperation provides fertile soil for Mamet's scathingly rich dialogue, which is like rocket fuel for some of the greatest actors of our time. Pacino won an Oscar nomination for his volatile performance, but it's Lemmon who's the standout, doing some of the best work of his distinguished career. Director James Foley shapes Mamet's play into a stylish, intensely focused film that will stand for decades as a testament to its brilliant writer and cast.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303515223", "1558807780"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 369412}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.3, "brand": "", "asin": "6302732875", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51S2V1ZW1GL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Glengarry Glen Ross [VHS]"}

{"description": "Rock historians and hard-core Buddy Holly fans can and do take issue with director Steve Rash's 1978 biopic of the Lubbock, Texas, rocker's life: the script liberally juggles details from Holly's brief but blazing career, replacing producer Norman Petty and Holly's original bassist and drummer with fictionalized composite characters. Yet the core of the film, and the reason it's definitely worth a look and listen, is Gary Busey's lusty performance in the title role, triumphing against what might have seemed miscasting.The burly, lantern-jawed Busey steps into the lankier, narrow-faced Holly's blue suede shoes and dances off with the movie. At a time when live rock albums thought little of overdubbing mistakes in the studio, director Rash honored Busey's nervy gamble in performing these songs live, singing in his own raw voice and rumbling through his own approximations of Holly's guitar work. What's lost in precise verisimilitude is more than compensated by Busey's conviction and a palpable, almost ecstatic terror as he charges through Holly's wonderful songs before indifferent roller-rink audiences.Other films have nailed the period more accurately through art direction or script, but Busey's authentic energy gives this movie an emotional veracity that's just right for this chapter in rock history. Still, for musical purposes, go straight to the source, Holly's wonderful recordings.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000003U12", "0767825985", "1558035745", "6300182304", "6301978587", "0783222955", "B000006FNX", "6301797906", "B00004CNR5", "6303215734"], "bought_together": ["B000003U12", "1558035745"], "also_viewed": ["B0002VGTBQ", "B000A50460"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 304717}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.99, "brand": "", "asin": "630280096X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WZ02HTT6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Buddy Holly Story [VHS] (1978)"}

{"description": "Feverish debate always surrounds the true merits of this controversial 1968 musical. Thoughts seem to be continually divided as to whether \"Star!\",was the \"the film that deservedly sank the career of Julie Andrews\", or that it was \"the greatest piece of work Julie Andrews has ever done on film\". From the moment of this film's original release in 1968 they are the two most hotly contested viewpoints about this Robert Wise production that reteamed him with his \"The Sound of Music\", leading lady Julie Andrews. I tend to think after repeated viewings that \"Star!\",contains some of the best work by a musical comedy actress in the whole 1960's decade and certainly is one of the crowning achievements in the acting career of Julie Andrews despite the films lack of financial success. Why wasn't this film then the success many feel it ought to have been? Firstly by late 1968 the musical genre was definately going out of style with the advent of much more permissive \"socially questioning\" dramas such as \"Midnight Cowboy\", and \"Easy Rider\", and the period saw a very high number of big budget movies like \"Paint Your Wagon\", and \"Sweet Charity\", not being successful at the Box Office. Also the role of the feisty, foul mouthed Gertrude Lawrence was a big departure from the usual type of role that had endeared Julie Andrews to movie goers. While different from her roles in \"The Sound of Music\", and \"Thoroughly Modern Millie\", \"Star!\", needs to be judged on its own individual merits and is a marvelous showcase for the multi talents of Julie Andrews.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000524DN"], "also_viewed": ["B000005LBV"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 519514}, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Soundtracks"], ["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.16, "brand": "", "asin": "6302900212", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YJ6G0ZXML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star [VHS]"}

When the real president has a stroke while in bed with an aide, his ambitious chief of staff (Frank Langella) decides to hold onto the White House by appealing to Dave's sense of patriotism and having him pose as the president. Soon, however, Dave is running the country in a way contrary to what the chief of staff would like, even as he finds himself falling in love with the unsuspecting first lady (Sigourney Weaver).

{"description": "Taylor Hackford (An Officer and a Gentleman) directed this 1993 epic about Chicano gang wars in the California prison system and the differing and tragic paths of three boyhood friends. Half-brothers Paco and Cruz grow up with their cousin Miklo in Chicano Los Angeles, and each in turn is influenced by their violent environment and the prevalence of drugs on their streets. Cruz becomes an artist but winds up tragically addicted to heroin, while Miklo serves time for murder and Paco becomes a cop, setting the stage for a confrontation between the two when Miklo is released from prison. The film strives for an epic feel but takes too long to set up its interweaving stories. It is notable, however, for some fine acting on the part of Benjamin Bratt and Damian Chiapa, as well as smaller roles by Billy Bob Thornton, Ving Rhames and Delroy Lindo.

{"description": "Consistently cited by critics worldwide as one of the greatest films ever made, Jean Renoir's bittersweet drama of life, love, class, and the social code of manners and behavior (\"the rules of the game\") is a savage critique undertaken with sensitivity and compassion. Renoir's catch-phrase through the film, \"Everyone has their reasons,\" develops a multilayered meaning by the conclusion. A young aviator (Roland Toutain) commits a serious social faux pas by alluding to an affair on national radio. To avert a scandal, the cultured Robert de la Chesnaye (Marcel Dalio), husband to the aviator's mistress, Christine (Nora Gregor), and a philanderer in his own right, invites all to a weekend hunting party in his country mansion. The complicated maze of marriages and mistresses (social register and servant class alike) is plotted like a bedroom farce, but the tone soon takes a darker cast. Renoir, who also takes the pivotal role as Andre's jovial pal and de la Chesnaye confidant Octave, deftly blends high comedy with cutting satire as he parallels the upstairs-downstairs affairs. The film builds to a comic pitch with the hilarious performance of Julien Carette as a rabbit poacher turned groundskeeper, but soon turns tragic in a devastating conclusion. The film was roundly condemned and banned in France upon its 1939 release, but years later (out of the shadow of WWII) the film was rediscovered for the masterpiece that it is.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 412283}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "The Rules of the Game [VHS]", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304628188"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JT64E0AAL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "6302969301"}

But a murderous gang called the Cowboys has burst on the scene, and Earp can't keep his gun belt off any longer.

{"description": "This is the movie that Leonardo DiCaprio received an Oscar nomination for, five years beforeTitanic. And, in fact, this is the movie that should have made him a star, he's so good in it. Based on the novel by Peter Hedges (who adapted his own book) and directed by Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m (My Life as a Dog), this is the funny, moody tale of a young man named Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp) who lives at home in a small town with his 500-pound Momma (beautifully played by nonpro Darlene Cates), his mentally retarded younger brother Arnie (DiCaprio, utterly convincing), and his sisters. Not a lot happens--Arnie keeps climbing a water tower and getting stuck; Gilbert is involved with a married woman (Mary Steenburgen), then meets a nice new girl in town who's closer to his age (Juliette Lewis). And that's exactly what makes this movie so much more than your run-of-the-mill Hollywood product: it's not about some mechanical, formulaic plot; it's about these characters, and it allows you to spend some time with them and get to know them. Depp may have started out as a TV teen idol on21 Jump Street, but his feature film choices since then--in such wonderfully offbeat and diverse movies asCry-Baby,Edward Scissorhands,Benny & Joon,Donnie Brasco--have made him one of the most interesting, unpredictable, and risk-taking young actors in American movies.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301763041", "630018403X"], "bought_together": ["6301763041"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 216191}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.79, "brand": "", "asin": "6303124798", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51APPGGETRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "What's Eating Gilbert Grape [VHS]"}

Beginning on the icy planet Krypton, the story follows the baby Kal-El, whose rocket ship lands in Smallville, Kansas. He is found there by a childless couple and raised as the shy Clark Kent (the young Kent is played by Jeff East). The film is perhaps most touching in these sequences, with expanses of wheat fields blowing in the wind and with a young man who can't figure out what part in destiny his great powers are meant to play. The second half, with Reeve taking over as Clark/Superman, is bustling, enchanting (the scene in which Superman flies girlfriend Lois Lane--played by Margot Kidder--through the night sky is great date material), and funny, thanks largely to Gene Hackman's sardonic portrayal of nemesis Lex Luthor.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300268993", "B000059XYC", "6300270122", "6303020089", "B000059XXZ", "0784011923", "B0002XNSYA", "B00005A1VG", "6303506291", "6301969413", "0800198395", "6302941318", "6304509154", "630196649X", "6304508611", "0790731975", "0790700506", "6300181537", "B000059XY5", "0790733897", "B00000JGEI", "6300214311", "6304047843", "6302238331", "6300214060", "630407185X", "6303148352", "6303212379", "6302510023", "0783216084", "B00004TYS8", "6302380294", "0790744589", "0792133153", "6302091632", "6302098424", "6304143184", "B0000068SI", "B00004RNAC", "6302510031", "630251018X", "6302510015", "B0000CDL3W", "6302510198", "B0001VL30O", "B000006FNX", "6302909023", "B000065U6Q", "6302032377"], "bought_together": ["6300268993", "B000059XYC"], "also_viewed": ["B000IJ79WU", "6300268993", "B000059Z8K", "B000P6XQ50", "B0039208JE", "6300270122", "B000IJ79VQ", "B000059XYC", "B000IJ79X4", "B001DJLD2G", "B000059XXZ", "B00F4FFO8E", "B00005JKCH", "6302642248", "6303953425", "B00005LIRF", "B00EAPMGIU", "B000IJ79XE", "B00BBND56G", "0790734079", "0784011923", "B000VI70QS", "B00005LKLF", "B000059Z8L", "B000UR9T8C", "B00005JXY3", "B0039208QM", "6303506291", "B0016MOWOQ", "B0087F7VSY", "B00000GUNY", "0783222726", "B00DYEN6XC", "B00E5I2MCM", "B0090SI582", "B00JPS6A3O", "B0057R5XRG", "B008JFUO72", "B008JFUS0U"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 202304}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6303212263", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51E39PXF9BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Superman the Movie [VHS]"}

{"description": "Four years before he revived and elevated the Western inStagecoach, director John Ford guided this atmospheric melodrama to multiple Academy Awards, proving that his underlying skills as a storyteller, visual designer, and dramatic guide didn't need epic scale, sweeping action, or favorite star John Wayne to achieve dramatic impact. Based on Liam O'Flaherty's novel set during the Sinn Fein rebellion in 1922, Dudley Nichols's script offers an intimate portrait of Gypo Nolan, a violent, alcoholic Dubliner who betrays a friend (Wallace Ford) for &#163;20, setting in motion a downward spiral of fear, anger, and drunken oblivion.The Impostercaptures Ford and filmmaking at an evolutionary balance point between the purer visual storytelling of silent film and the emerging literary possibilities of sound: on the one hand, Ford paints a nocturnal Dublin of deep shadows and billowing fog in which his characters are placed in pointed tableaux, and project their actions and attitudes with stylized, theatrical gestures that seem naive alongside later, more naturalistic films; on the other, the director pushes his star, Victor McLaglen, past traditional stagecraft toward a truly harrowing, authentic performance. Pauline Kael has noted the Hollywood legend that Ford induced McLaglen's Oscar-winning turn by keeping him too drunk to embellish his work. Whatever the cause, the actor achieves a lumbering, out-of-control power that traces the rage, confusion, and ultimate despair that Nolan's descent describes.

Evoking utopias and dystopias fromBraziltoPeter Pan, Caro and Jeunet create a vivid but menacing fantasy city in a perpetually twilight world. In this rough port town lives circus strongman One (Ron Perlman), who wanders the alleys and waterfront dives looking for his baby brother, snatched from him by a mysterious gang preying upon the children of the town. Rising from the harbor is an enigmatic castle where lives the evil scientist Krank (Daniel Emilfork), who has lost the ability to dream and robs the nocturnal visions of the children he kidnaps, but receives only mad nightmares from the lonely cherubs. Other wild characters include the Fagin-like Octopus--Siamese twin sisters who control a small gang of runaways-turned-thieves--Krank's six cloned henchmen (all played by the memorable Dominique Pinon fromDelicatessen), and a giant brain floating in an aquarium (voiced by Jean-Louis Trintignant). Caro and Jeunet are kindred souls to Terry Gilliam (who is a vocal fan), creating imaginative flights of fancy built of equal parts delight and dread, which seem to be painted on the screen in rich, dreamy colors.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300184064"]}, "price": 69.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 572605}, "asin": "6304080859", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KSX9TYT3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The City of Lost Children [VHS]"}
{"description": "This 1971 BBC version ofPersuasionmay not provide much competition for the excellent 1995 adaptation, but it's a thorough, faithful adaptation. At 27, Anne Elliot (Anne Firbank) has faded into  compliant spinsterhood. She's the voice of reason in her self-absorbed, class-conscious family, whose  excesses have brought them to near financial ruin. At 19, Anne loved a sailor, now the Captain Frederick  Wentworth  (Bryan Marshall), who, at the time, had little to recommend himself. At friend and neighbor  Lady Russell's (Marian Spencer) suggestion, Anne broke the engagement and has always quietly regretted it. Meanwhile, her father, Sir Walter Elliott (Basil Dignam), and elder sister Elizabeth (Valerie Gearon), finally realize  they must retrench and rent out their ancestral home, Kellynch. They take leave for Bath, at the  recommendation of Lady Russell. Ironically, Kellynch is let to Admiral and Mrs. Croft, the latter being  Wentworth's sister. While visiting with her younger sister Mary (Morag Hood) and Mary's husband Charles Musgrove  (William Kendall) on her way to Bath, Anne meets the now wealthy Wentworth, who appears to be  courting one of Charles's sisters, Louisa (Zhivila Roche). Eventually, in typical Austen fashion, true love finds its way.ThisPersuasionoffers lighter versions of Anne and Wentworth. Firbank is a little mature to play  Anne, but she's likeable. While the costumes seem right, if a little bright, the hair (especially  Firbank's) is definitely early-1970s party-do. The interior shots, done on tape, resemble a brighter Regency  version ofDark Shadowsand the exterior shots are done on film; it's a little disconcerting, but  forgivable. There's also clearer explanation and detail regarding Anne and Wentworth's actions, and, as  depicted in the original work, an explanation of Anne's friend Mrs. Smith's connection to Anne's duplicitous cousin  Mr. Elliot (Rowland Davies).--N.F.

For many the film is chiefly remembered for James Dean's final performance, as poor former ranch hand Jett Rink, who strikes oil and transforms himself into a flamboyant millionaire playboy. Director George Stevens won his second Oscar for this ambitious, grandly realized (if sometimes slow moving) epic of the changing socioeconomic (and physical) landscape of modern Texas, based on Edna Ferber's bestselling novel. The talented supporting cast includes Mercedes McCambridge as Bick's frustrated sister, put out by the new \"woman of the house\"; Chill Wills as the Benedicts' garrulous rancher neighbor; Carroll Baker and Dennis Hopper as the Benedicts' rebellious children; and Earl Holliman and Sal Mineo as dedicated ranch hands.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000059HH1", "6302797616", "6305123616", "1569942072", "B000005PPB", "6300182371", "6300215830", "B000006FKX", "6301045750", "B00068S41I", "0792107683", "6300183890", "B000A1KF8Q", "6301599225", "B000054OW2", "6300215644", "B00004TX2D", "6302655897", "0767825616", "6301976622", "0792839129", "B00005A1VH"], "bought_together": ["6302797616", "B000059HH1"], "also_viewed": ["B004XKVP7K", "B0007TKNK6", "B0000040EJ", "B0000068ZQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 221648}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.98, "brand": "", "asin": "6304239149", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MN3CNVQYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Giant (Special Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "One of the first studio films to deal with interracial romance (or even the possibility of it),A Patch of Bluewas a huge hit  upon its release, appealing to those looking for both social protest and a smart date movie. Sidney Poitier plays Gordon, a compassionate stranger who befriends a blind white girl named Selina (Elizabeth Hartman). Selina, the next thing to a shut-in, can only judge people by their voices, and Gordon's is unusually patient, kind. Troubles ensue when Selina's abusive mother (Shelley Winters in her second  Oscar-winning performance) happens upon the pair during one of their park rendezvous. Ivan Dixon plays Poitier's militant brother, and veteran Wallace Ford appears as Selina's kindly lush of a grandfather. Jerry Goldsmith earned an Oscar nomination for his lilting piano theme, surely one of the simplest, most effective pieces of music to grace a Hollywood film.--Glenn Lovell", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000068Z8", "B00003L9C1", "B000E1MXSW", "B000TXP56C", "0800104803", "6301115430", "6302226899"], "bought_together": ["B00003L9C1"], "also_viewed": ["B00AATGDW0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 377124}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.25, "brand": "", "asin": "6304308434", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CXQVF83JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Patch of Blue [VHS]"}
{"description": "MGM originally promotedDinner at Eightby touting the \"all-star cast,\" but this is no run-of-the-mill omnibus picture. On the contrary, rather than cramming as many big names as possible into a lumbering vehicle, the movie's impeccably crafted script (by Edna Ferber and Herman J. Mankiewicz) and direction (by George Cukor) gave some immortal screen luminaries a chance to shine. For sheer bravery, John Barrymore's achingly poignant performance as Larry Renault, a washed-up matinee idol who has \"outlived everything but his vanity,\" is unmatched. Barrymore's brother, Lionel, is equally touching as shipping magnate Oliver Jordan. Oliver vainly tries to save his family's century-old firm, at the same time hiding his financial and health troubles from his wife, Millicent, played to hysterical perfection by Billie Burke. The Great Depression is presented in microcosm as Millicent frets about throwing the ultimate society dinner, oblivious to the world tumbling down around her. She is forced to invite to her precious party such undesirables as crass financier Dan Packard (\"HesmellsOklahoma!\"). Even worse in Millicent's eyes than Packard (Wallace Beery, doing an impressive steamroller imitation) is his social-climbing wife, Kitty (Jean Harlow, never funnier than she is here, malingering in bed gobbling chocolates, or braying at her husband: \"I'm gonna be a lady if it kills me!\"). Be sure to watch for Harlow's brief encounter with Marie Dressler, who brings an extraordinary winking wisdom to the role of aging star Carlotta Vance. As the two enter the dining room in the film's final scene, Harlow makes an offhand remark that elicits from Dressler one of the great screen double takes of all time. Like so much ofDinner At Eight, the moment is priceless.--Laura Mirsky", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301973178", "6302605105", "6300988805", "630266232X", "B000021Y6K"], "also_viewed": ["6301967615", "6301973178", "6302605156", "B0047BXR1C"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 467941}, "asin": "6304308477", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NYVZJK1FL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dinner at Eight [VHS]"}
{"description": "Val Kilmer stars as Lt. Col. John Patterson, a 19th-century Irish engineer drafted by Britain's railroad bosses to build a trestle bridge over an African river, thus expanding the empire a tiny bit more. In Tsavo, Patterson is instantly hailed for killing a man-eating lion that had been making life hell for native workers. But morale sinks when a pair of unstoppable big cats devour more men and destroy the project. Along comes an Ahab-like, expatriate American hunter (Michael Douglas) to help Patterson face the almost preternatural powers of the two killers. The script by William Goldman (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) is based on fact, though the film owes more to Spielberg (specifically toJaws) than history. There are also suggestive echoes of Kipling and Conrad in the material and characters, and there are hints of emotional complexity and psychological nuance that make one wish this could have been a great film instead of a merely fun one.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303168507", "0792133153"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 276347}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.98, "brand": "", "asin": "6304353634", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71N5C6KAQFL._SY300_.gif", "title": "The Ghost and the Darkness [VHS]"}
{"description": "An oddball love story about a fey loner named Sam (Johnny Depp), who falls in love with the mentally unbalanced Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson), who lives in the care of her protective brother Benny (Aidan Quinn). This 1993 story is hard to swallow, with its message that love can conquer a brand of mental illness that manifests itself in pyromania: Joon has a bad habit of going a bit around the bend and setting fires, but Sam's tender care apparently has the cure for what ails her. Still, if you want proof that Depp has significant chops as a physical comedian, give this film a try: He does note-perfect renditions of slapstick routines made famous by Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton.--Marshall Fine", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 343205}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6304411448", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519Q07CHSSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Benny &amp; Joon [VHS]"}
{"description": "Akira Kurosawa's rousingSeven Samuraiwas a natural for an American remake--after all, the codes and conventions of ancient Japan and the Wild West (at least the mythical movie West) are not so very far apart. ThusThe Magnificent Seveneffortlessly turns samurai into cowboys (the same trick worked more than once: Kurosawa'sYojimbobecame Sergio Leone'sA Fistful of Dollars). The beleaguered denizens of a Mexican village, weary of attacks by banditos, hire seven gunslingers to repel the invaders once and for all. The gunmen are cool and capable, with most of the actors playing them just on the cusp of '60s stardom: Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn. The man who brings these warriors together is Yul Brynner, the baddest bald man in the West. There's nothing especially stylish about the approach of veteran director John Sturges (The Great Escape), but the storytelling is clear and strong, and the charisma of the young guns fairly flies off the screen. If that isn't enough to awaken the 12-year-old kid inside anyone, the unforgettable Elmer Bernstein music will do it: bum-bum-ba-bum, bum-ba-bum-ba-bum.... Followed by three inferior sequels,Return of the Seven,Guns of the Magnificent Seven, andThe Magnificent Seven Ride!--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["0784011923", "6300269639", "0767825411", "6300183181", "6303344224", "6301570723", "6302824729", "B00000490M", "6305814694", "6302091632", "6300214753", "B0000048S1", "6300216500", "6302765536", "6304932553", "0783216084", "B00000JGEI", "B00005B6ND", "6300184951", "0790731436", "B000JM6B1G", "6300182533", "6302718961", "B000003KDG", "6301966317", "0790751216", "6300269043", "0792107683", "6301976401", "0792845684", "6300213668", "6302360978", "6304071876", "6300213838", "0792838408", "6305123616", "6301827732", "6303540082", "6302374189", "6300251012", "0790731975", "6300182495", "6302909023", "6305237115", "0790738139", "0792106989", "0782008348", "6303402070", "6300214567", "B00008DZ83", "B0000BWVBD", "B00006G8LB", "0792110188", "630018403X", "6301802330", "6303651461", "B000059XY5", "6302130379", "6300215695", "6304935811", "630196733X", "6300268799", "6302032237", "6300214710", "6300215814", "6301968948", "6302309751", "B00004TYS8", "6301395395", "6303236863", "6300214370", "6300183467", "0790734079", "6304773412", "0792835077", "1558802258", "B000056BRF", "6302238331", "6304773390", "6302380588", "B000006FNX", "6301971426", "0790733897", "6304429274", "B00004WZR1", "6300216012", "6300215644", "0783235593", "0792842464", "6304039522", "630336568X", "B00004RFFA", "0800100832", "6303123244", "6300215962", "6300182452", "0792837371", "6302032261", "6301966988"], "bought_together": ["0784011923", "6300269639"], "also_viewed": ["B003DZAM8O", "0792838408"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 297275}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.94, "brand": "", "asin": "630442972X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SRHRTAMPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Magnificent Seven [VHS]"}

{"description": "After Martin Scorsese went to Hollywood in 1972 to direct the low-budgetBoxcar Berthafor B-movie mogul Roger Corman, the young director showed the film to maverick director John Cassavetes and got an instant earful of urgent advice. \"It's crap,\" said Cassavetes in no uncertain terms, \"now go out and make something that comes from your heart.\" Scorsese took the advice and focused his energy onMean Streets, a riveting contemporary film about low-life gangsters in New York's Little Italy that critic Pauline Kael would later call \"a true original, and a triumph of personal filmmaking.\" Starring Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel in roles that announced their talent to the world, it set the stage for Scorsese's emergence as one of the greatest American filmmakers. Introducing themes and character types that Scorsese would return to inTaxi Driver,GoodFellas,Casino, and other films, the loosely structured story is drawn directly from Scorsese's background in the Italian neighborhoods of New York, and it seethes with the raw vitality of a filmmaker who has found his creative groove. As the irresponsible and reckless Johnny Boy, De Niro offers striking contrast to Keitel's Charlie, who struggles to reconcile gang life with Catholic guilt. More of an episodic portrait than a plot-driven crime story,Mean Streetsremains one of Scorsese's most direct and fascinating films--a masterful calling card for a director whose greatness was clearly apparent from that point forward.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790733927", "6302842263", "630026887X", "B000005PPB", "6302816629", "6301564456"], "also_viewed": ["6302066891", "6303534368"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 426972}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6304457375", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CA63GNNXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mean Streets [VHS]"}

{"description": "Dashing Errol Flynn is the definitive Robin Hood in the most gloriously swashbuckling version of the legendary story. Warner Brothers reunited Michael Curtiz, their top-action director, with the winning team of Flynn and Olivia de Havilland (Maid Marian) and perennial villain Basil Rathbone as the aristocratic Sir Guy of Gisbourne, and pulled out all stops for the production. It became their costliest film to date, a grandly handsome, glowing Technicolor adventure set to a stirring,Oscar-winning scoreby Erich Wolfgang Korngold. The decadent Prince John (a smoothly conniving Claude Rains) takes advantage of King Richard's absence to tax the country into poverty but meets his match in the medieval guerrilla rebel Robin Hood and his Merry Men of Sherwood Forest, who rise up and, to quote a clich&eacute; coined by the film, \"steal from the rich and give to the poor.\" Stocky Alan Hale Sr. plays Robin's loyal friend Little John (a part he played in Douglas Fairbanks's silent version), Eugene Palette the portly Friar Tuck, and Melville Cooper the bumbling Sheriff of Nottingham. Flynn's confidence and cocky charm makes for a perfect Robin Hood, and his easygoing manner is a marvelous counterpoint to Rathbone's regal bearing and courtly diction. The film climaxes in their rousing battle-to-the-finish sword fight, a magnificently choreographed scene highlighted by Curtiz's inventive use of shadows cast upon the castle walls.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302120527", "6301976932", "6301977181", "6301977149", "6303212263", "6305123616", "B00004RFHL", "6301574117", "0790743159", "6300214060", "B00005A1VH", "6304178352", "0792839846", "630233683X", "6301977173", "6302961688", "630150528X", "6304935811", "B00005RRG6", "B00000JKNP", "6301973305", "6301670140", "1558800034", "0792107683", "B00004RGUU", "0782008348"], "bought_together": ["6301977149"], "also_viewed": ["B00005PJ8I"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 538065}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6304546386", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RMAFMQ02L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Adventures of Robin Hood [VHS]"}

{"description": "A romantic drama in theMasterpiece Theatervein, this John Madden film looks at the relationship between Queen Victoria and John Brown, a commoner who, though a servant, becomes her closest friend and confidant. As such, he proves the catalyst to bring her back into public life and out of her private mourning for the late Prince Albert. But the closeness of their friendship sets tongues wagging about the impropriety of what appears to be an affair between queen and commoner (an issue the film never directly addresses). The film's charm lies in the flinty give-and-take between the wonderfully starchy Judi Dench as Victoria and the robust Scottish comedian Billy Connolly, here playing it straight as a strong-willed Scotsman who comes to enjoy the power he wields by virtue of having the queen's ear. Antony Sher is also striking as Prime Minister Disraeli, in a performance that all but shimmers with unspoken malice.--Marshall Fine", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 179264}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.99, "brand": "", "asin": "630482615X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WHKP001HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mrs. Brown [VHS]"}
{"description": "Parker Posey was the It Girl of independent film in early 1997, the year this film (along with three or four others in which she starred) all played at the Sundance Film Festival. This film was the toughest of the bunch to embrace, based as it was on a self-consciously quirky off-Broadway play about Thanksgiving at the home of a particularly strange family. Oldest son Josh Hamilton comes home from college for the holidays, with fianc&eacute;e Tori Spelling in tow. What he hasn't told her is that his twin sister, Jackie-O (played by Posey), thinks she's Jackie Kennedy--or that he and Jackie-O have shared more than, shall we say, filial affection. Posey is wonderfully edgy and she and Hamilton spar with entertaining vigor, but you still have to cope with writer-director Mark Waters's pretentious script.--Marshall Fine", "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 345071}, "asin": "6304826168", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZREEVF3ML._SY300_.gif", "title": "House of Yes [VHS]"}
{"description": "When viewed from a cranky perspective, this by-the-book David versus Goliath story doesn't offer any surprises, and it's a bit sad to watch director Francis Coppola (who also adapted John Grisham's bestseller) squandering his once-glorious talent on such conventional Hollywood fare. In a more charitable light, however, there's great pleasure to be found in Coppola's intelligent, no-nonsense handling of a plot that's every bit as involving as it is formulaic. Coppola also knows how to bring out the best in a stellar cast, and this is the movie (released in November 1997, just a few weeks beforeGood Will Hunting) that signaled Matt Damon's arrival as a major-league star. Damon plays Rudy Baylor, a young rookie lawyer in Memphis (location of many Grisham stories) who takes on a powerful insurance company (led by shark-like lawyer Jon Voight) by representing the family of a boy who was denied potentially life-saving treatment for leukemia. Rudy also comes to the rescue of an abused wife (Claire Danes) and learns the tricks of the legal trade from a seasoned paralegal (Danny DeVito) who sees Rudy as his ticket out of the sleaze-ball practice run by a shady lawyer (Mickey Rourke). There's no mystery about where this plot is going, but Coppola takes us there in high style with a sharp script, and Damon strikes just the right note of naivete and strategic intelligence. When Goliath inevitably falls, this courtroom David wins fair and square.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304259131", "6302935148", "0790748169", "B00020HABA", "B00003CXTF", "6305622825", "6305718792", "6303269834", "0792133153", "0783221347", "B00007CVYA", "6303313345", "6300183211", "B00004WIDB", "0790701251", "6302945089", "B00000IO4G"], "bought_together": ["6304259131"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 362387}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.24, "brand": "", "asin": "6304925131", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51362Y4QKQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rainmaker [VHS]"}

{"description": "Bull Durhamis about minor league baseball. It's also about romance, sex, poetry, metaphysics, and talent--though not necessarily in that order. Susan Sarandon plays a loopy lady who just loves America's national pastime--and the men who play it. At the opening of every season, she attaches herself to a promising rookie and guides him through the season. Unfortunately, the player she bestows her favors upon does not really deserve it. She knows it, and veteran Kevin Costner knows it. Her choice, a dim bulb played for laughs by Tim Robbins, is the only one who doesn't know it. The film, directed by its writer, Ron Shelton, a former minor league player, is rich in subtle detail. There are Edith Piaf records playing in the background, fast-talking managers, and minor characters as developed as the leads. Sarandon's retro-'50s outfits make you think she's just another bimbo, not an English teacher very much in control of her life. And Costner's clear-eyed, slightly vitriolic performance is devastatingly sexy and keenly witty. The love scenes, though tasteful, are almost as humorous as they are hot. Sarandon's character likes to tie her players up and expand their horizons by reading Walt Whitman to them, \"'cause a guy will listen to anything if he thinks it's foreplay.\" How can you not love a movie with such a wicked sense of humor?--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFYKWU", "B0068FZ0GK", "B000MNOX94", "078324021X", "B0010YSD90", "0800177258", "B000068NNU", "B00005M20J", "B002AT8KD8", "B0060ZJ7BC", "B000FOPPDI", "B009NNM9OA", "B00DW5IKW0", "B00028HBES", "B00009AOAX", "0792844874", "B00AEFXHNI", "0767817729", "B000A0GXRO", "0792843592", "B009POCG2C", "B002NZK5TQ", "B00009AOAW", "B004AOECXI", "B00GMTTD56", "B00E1HIWTO", "B00AEBB9NM", "B003AWRM9M", "B0006GAI5U", "B00F3LSXPA", "B00005N89R", "B000HC2LHG", "0800141822", "0800141741", "B00007BKVC", "B00004W221", "B00005V0XF", "B008H6GHHY", "B00AEFYR3C", "B000MNOX7G", "B0000DIXDR", "B0001US66Y", "B0000633U2", "B0000TANUI", "B007N31YH0", "B0007LLPXI", "B000069I1K", "0783225733", "B00JPV95GK", "B000CCBCAS", "B001YV504U", "B004X2TYG2", "6305262268", "B00004RF84", "B0012YYZDG", "B000P0J0EW", "B0007IO6NM", "6305128952", "B0013XZ760", "B002VWNID6", "B003S1UNZU", "B002U4UYYQ", "B00IB3SDRK", "B00005JNP4", "B00004XPPB", "B00004RE27", "B002GHHHHO", "B002VWNICC", "B000CNFC76", "B001LGXIA6", "B00AATUZLU", "B000056VP4", "B001ILFUBE", "B00AEFYVUQ", "B00005B6JZ", "6305212112", "B00B83ROIE", "B0045HCJJ4", "B002GHHHP6", "B0000AOV4I", "B00AMSQBP8", "B0024EWP6W", "B000XJD33O", "B0004Z33G4", "B00AEFYJI0", "B00GHJ1YUI", "B00026ZG10", "B0006J28NC", "B00079Z9VO", "B004SIP9U6", "B0006Q941Y", "B00AEBB9UK", "B0002WZTOI", "0792838408", "B00005O06I", "B000EXZFCQ", "B00007LP8J", "B00066FBQG", "B000F6ZIII"], "bought_together": ["B0068FZ0GK", "B000MNOX94"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0068FZ0GK", "078324021X", "B0060ZJ7BC", "B000068NNU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 312090}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.97, "brand": "", "asin": "6305090645", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71455K7BRSL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Bull Durham"}
{"description": "David O. Selznick wantedGone with the Windto be somehow more than a movie, a film that would broaden the very idea of what a film could be and do and look like. In many respects he got what he worked so hard to achieve in this 1939 epic (and all-time box-office champ in terms of tickets sold), and in some respects he fell far short of the goal. While the first half of this Civil War drama is taut and suspenseful and nostalgic, the second is ramshackle and arbitrary. But there's no question that the film is an enormous achievement in terms of its every resource--art direction, color, sound, cinematography--being pushed to new limits for the greater glory of telling an American story as fully as possible. Vivien Leigh is still magnificently narcissistic, Olivia de Havilland angelic and lovely, Leslie Howard reckless and aristocratic.

{"description": "Mike Nichols directed the 1965 stage production of Neil Simon'sThe Odd Couple, but while Nichols went on to become a vitally intelligent director of contemporary comedy, Simon's career thrived in the 1970s and '80s before dwindling towards sentimental fluff like this amusing but mildly disappointing sequel. Closer toGrumpy Old Menthan the wry wit of Simon's original play and 1968 screen adaptation, the movie finds former roommates Oscar (Walter Matthau) and Felix (Jack Lemmon) reluctantly reuniting for the wedding of Oscar's son to Felix's daughter. When they get sidetracked in California, the road-movie formula unleashes the comedic chemistry of Lemmon and Matthau (which alone makes the movie worthwhile), but it's too casual to match the original's depth or dramatic foundation. Simon andGrumpydirector Howard Deutch could have deepened the Oscar-Felix relationship to make it funnier and more emotionally involving, but instead they've played it safe with some good laughs in the kind of sketch comedy that Nichols would avoid. Simon's capable of much better than this, but Lemmon-Matthau fans will have a good time anyway.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFYRJQ", "B00020HAXI", "B0007QJ1Y8", "B000FOPPC4", "B000056HEF", "B00AEFYT1W", "B00C1TOTIC", "0790731460", "B008FYZJ2C", "6304698607", "B0022NHTD4", "B0000633R5", "B0007QJ1ZW", "B0007P0XAA", "B002GHHHGU", "B008FYZIEQ", "B00020X87K", "B0010AN7Z4", "B0024396DI", "B00AEBB9E6", "B00AEFYT94", "B00AMSM9EK", "B00441GYRO", "B000MGBSH6", "B0003JANSW", "076780676X", "B00049QJ9I", "6305213283", "B0006HBZBK", "B0000AUHQ4", "B00005JL3W", "B000XKW2WG", "B000FZETR0", "B000E6ESI0", "B000065U1D", "B006VRRGRG", "B0002TSZHY", "B00AEFYO08", "B0000CBY1C", "B0001V1M6E", "B00507O3II", "B00005T7HZ", "B000K7VHTQ", "B00008DDXA", "B00023P4PQ", "B00JDCP0QA", "B002GHHHP6", "B00AQ59078", "6305428263", "B00009AOAY", "B0000A2ZO0", "B00G7QPUII", "B00008977G", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B0022S5B48", "B0007QJ1W0", "B0007QJ1XE", "B00AEFY0KW", "B00020HAWE", "B002Y4Z4RO", "B004CTG6TO", "B00AEBB9WI", "B00009MEKO", "B000ANVPSS", "B00KDK64DY", "B00005UWU6", "B00386EZKE", "B00008O38G", "B00005V5NS", "B000FTCLQC", "B0006J28LO", "B00008L3W3", "B0000JBALO", "B000MH0V3M", "B0018E03CW", "B0003JAOPO", "B0009PVZ9Q", "6305428034", "B000PMFRYW", "0767803434", "0790740044", "630530887X", "B000286RO8", "B00132D7XQ", "B00AEBB8OC", "B005ELVCS4", "B0000VV5BM", "B001DE29SS", "B0009X75QK", "B00HFWETZ8", "0767821556", "B000T5O47G", "B001DHXT48", "B0000648ZR", "B003ASLJIQ", "B000056VOZ", "B000M53GM2", "B00AEFXPG2", "B00GOC752E", "B00GM5U80Y"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFYRJQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFYRJQ", "B000FOPPC4", "B00020HAXI", "B00AEFYT1W"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 83190}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6305127700", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/414YZKWTANL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Odd Couple II"}
{"description": "If you were to argue that Mel Brooks'sYoung Frankensteinranks among the top-ten funniest movies of all time, nobody could reasonably dispute the claim. Spoofing classic horror in the way that Brooks's previous filmBlazing Saddlessent up classic Westerns, the movie is both a loving tribute and a raucous, irreverent parody of Universal's classic horror filmsFrankenstein(1931) andBride of Frankenstein(1935). Filming in glorious black and white, Brooks re-created theFrankensteinlaboratory using the same equipment from the originalFrankenstein(courtesy of designer Kenneth Strickfaden), and this loving attention to physical and stylistic detail creates a solid foundation for nonstop comedy. The story, of course, involves Frederick Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) and his effort to resume experiments in re-animation pioneered by his late father. (He's got some help, since dad left behind a book titledHow I Did It.) Assisting him is the hapless hunchback Igor (Marty Feldman) and the buxom but none-too-bright maiden Inga (Teri Garr), and when Frankenstein succeeds in creating his monster (Peter Boyle), the stage is set for an outrageous revision of the Frankenstein legend. With comedy highlights too numerous to mention, Brooks guides his brilliant cast (also including Cloris Leachman, Madeline Kahn, Kenneth Mars, and Gene Hackman in a classic cameo role) through scene after scene of inspired hilarity. Indeed,Young Frankensteinis a charmed film, nothing less than a comedy classic, representing the finest work from everyone involved. Not one joke has lost its payoff, and none of the countless gags have lost their zany appeal. From a career that includes some of the best comedies ever made, this is the film for which Mel Brooks will be most fondly remembered. Befitting a classic, the Special Edition DVD includes audio commentary by Mel Brooks, a \"making of\" documentary, interviews with the cast, hilarious bloopers and outtakes, and the original theatrical trailers. No video library should be without a copy ofYoung Frankenstein.

{"description": "The 1998 testosterone-saturated blow-'em-up from producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay (The Rock,Bad Boys) continues Hollywood's millennium-fueled fascination with the destruction of our planet. There's no arguing that the successful duo understands what mainstream American audiences want in their blockbuster movies--loads of loud, eye-popping special effects, rapid- fire pacing, and patriotic flag waving. Bay's protagonists--the eight crude, lewd, oversexed (but lovable, of course) oil drillers summoned to save the world from a Texas-sized meteor hurling toward the earth--are not flawless heroes, but common men with whom all can relate. In this huge Western-in-space soap opera, they're American cowboys turned astronauts. Sci-fi buffs will appreciate Bay's fetishizing of technology, even though it's apparent he doesn't understand it as anything more than flashing lights and shiny gadgets. Smartly, the duo also tries to lure the art-house crowd, raiding the local indie acting stable and populating the film with guys like Steve Buscemi, Billy Bob Thornton, Owen Wilson, and Michael Duncan, all adding needed touches of humor and charisma. When Bay applies his sledgehammer aesthetics to the action portions of the film, it's mindless fun; it's only whenArmageddontackles humanity that it becomes truly offensive. Not sinceMississippi Burninghave racial and cultural stereotypes been substituted for characters so blatantly--African Americans, Japanese, Chinese, Scottish, Samoans, Muslims, French ... if it's not white and American, Bay simplifies it. Or, make that whitemaleAmerica; the film features only three notable females--four if you count the meteor, who's constantly referred to as a \"bitch that needs drillin',\" but she's a hell of a lot more developed and unpredictable than the other women characters combined. Sure, Bay's film creates some tension and contains some visceral moments, but if he can't create any redeemable characters outside of those in space, what's the point of saving the planet?--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304681496", "6304233639", "0783222475", "0792845684", "B00003CXTF", "B00004WIDB", "B00000JGEN", "0792151712", "B000007OY0", "B0001DI5W6", "0783222955", "6302610702", "079213690X", "6302909023", "6300215830", "6301976622", "6301643410"], "bought_together": ["6304681496"], "also_viewed": ["6301398912", "630382790X", "6304233639", "6300214540", "6303257844", "B000003KHS", "0792151712", "B000059XYK", "0800125762", "B00005JM5E", "6302415853", "B00005PJ8I", "0783241542", "B00003CXTF"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 194393}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.38, "brand": "Touchstone Home Video", "asin": "6305169187", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515Y886RQYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Armageddon [VHS]"}

{"description": "This 1997 film from Norway and neophyte director Erik Skjoldbj&aelig;rg  delivers the goods with unsettling effectiveness. It's an intense, smart,  and taut thriller if only because what it eerily implies is creepier than the  film's reality. Opening with a churning, chilling murder of a young woman,Insomniainvites the viewer--as well as its protagonist, celebrated Oslo  homicide cop Jonas Engstr&ouml;m (Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd)--into the mind and  thoughts of a killer by making Engstr&ouml;m fatally flawed himself. While in pursuit of  the murderer, Engstr&ouml;m makes a mistake; he accidentally shoots his partner and  friend and covers up his deed in a panic. But he overlooks a minor detail:  the real killer has seen him commit the crime. What ensues is a layered,  complex, and unnerving descent into chaos, brought on by the inability to  sleep in this land of the midnight sun. Engstr&ouml;m suffers from insomnia,  which  warps his logic and resolve, and before long he's totally unraveled and  unsure of his every move. But not before a twisty transference and  countertransference occurs between cop and killer. The two play a game of  high-stakes one-upmanship that surprises in the end.Insomniais fresh and  psychologically bent, full of Scandinavian despair and dark humor, and it  boasts a film noir pulse beneath its blinding light.--Paula  Nechak", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005NFZC", "B00006FMCS", "B003LR5BD0", "B00JH4SZWK", "B00JPUUSEE", "B0081HLM2E", "B00000F3CD", "B00GBT62PQ", "B000BB14IA", "B004XVMCH6", "B00HE010QM", "B004N1JGI4", "B001CW7ZSA", "0780022343", "B004ALIG4M", "B005J47Q90", "B00JAQJNN0", "B00K6D1R0I", "B00004W3HG", "B00HT2RTU6", "B003KGBISE", "B004NWPY3E", "B00180R06I", "B00005BHW6", "B001CW7ZSU", "B00000CQJZ", "B00HVOFP6W", "B00005EBSF", "B00000C0QO", "B00005JL57", "B001EOQCJE", "B00HRJVHOU", "B00GPPXNEE", "B00HE01030", "B0000A02TX", "B004ALIG1U", "B0009298N4", "B002IVDLH8", "B00GPPXP6A", "0783228457", "B004WPYO7E", "B00J81S92S", "B000BR6QIW", "B00005A8TX", "B000093NQZ", "B001PYD0KM", "B00000F7E6", "0792838947", "B005152C9G", "B00FXOO2A2", "B001WLMOL4", "B003ELMR9E", "0780021541", "B00B2BYXSG", "B00AQ6J536", "B0002KPHZG", "B003TTBA0S", "B0007GAG42", "B004P2VQZ2", "B0009OUBC4", "6305228876", "B00005QAPH", "B000087EY5", "B00B2BYXTK", "B00005B1ZL", "B001BEK8E2", "B007N5YJWK", "B00005NC66", "B000I8OOG0", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B005KQVE1S", "B001BSBBJE", "B00HE011DE", "B001MYIXAC", "B004NWPY20", "B00005JMVQ", "B00004W3HF", "0780023099", "B000H5U5RG", "B00DZP1C9K", "B0057GYODG", "B00HVOFP9O", "B0009X75EC", "B002BWP4A6", "0780023277", "B00CUKTHES", "B00JQYV0B4", "B000KRNGOA", "B00F98FOFY", "B000305ZYS", "078062856X", "B000OPPAF6", "B001PYD0M0", "B00KE3B7BE", "B0047P5FU4", "B002E01MBA", "B00E18QKJ2", "B00JBGSHSQ", "B00005QAPI", "B006TTC5MM"], "bought_together": ["B00005NFZC", "B00006FMCS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005K3NY", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B00J2PQYYK", "B00J5JSV3A"]}, "price": 22.32, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 40121}, "asin": "6305389519", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/310DKGT5SAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Insomnia (The Criterion Collection)"}

{"description": "Italy's rubber-faced funnyman Roberto Benigni accomplishes the  impossible in his World War&nbsp;II comedyLife Is Beautiful: he shapes a  simultaneously hilarious and haunting comedy out of the tragedy of the Holocaust. An international sensation and the most successful foreign language film in U.S. history, the picture also earned director-cowriter-star Benigni Oscars for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Actor. He plays the Jewish country boy Guido, a madcap romantic in Mussolini's Italy who wins the heart of his sweetheart (Benigni's real-life sweetie, Nicoletta Braschi) and raises a darling son (the adorable Giorgio Cantarini) in the shadow of fascism. When the Nazis ship the men off to a concentration camp in the waning days of the war, Guido is determined to shelter his son from the evils around them and convinces him they're in an elaborate contest to win (of all things) a tank. Guido tirelessly maintains the ruse with comic ingenuity, even as the horrors escalate and the camp's population continues to dwindle--all the more  impetus to keep his son safe, secure, and, most of all, hidden. Benigni walks a fine line mining comedy from tragedy and his efforts are pure fantasy--he accomplishes feats no man could realistically pull off--both of  which have drawn fire from a few critics. Yet for all its wacky humor and inventive gags,Life Is Beautifulis a moving and poignant tale of one father's sacrifice to save not just his young son's life but his innocence in the face of one of the most evil acts ever perpetrated by the human race.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003JLL2RW", "B00007G25J", "B00000493Q", "6300216012", "0800100832"], "bought_together": ["B003JLL2RW"], "also_viewed": ["B0033PQUXA", "B00B0U2SEA", "B004SEUJ82", "6305291403", "0784011710", "B0010YSD7W", "B00AYXEW0C", "B000HEWEJO", "B000FVQLRA", "B0002CX1NY", "6303215734", "0783233477", "B00AEFY0F2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 290895}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.96, "brand": "", "asin": "6305426651", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51W27JXJYQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Life Is Beautiful (La Vita E Bella) [VHS]"}
{"description": "Are you wondering just exactly who the Blair Witch was? What the Burkittsville, Maryland, legend was all about? Or what exactly fascinated student filmmaker Heather and what possibly took her, Mike, and Josh from this earth? Get all your background questions answered byCurse of the Blair Witch, a one-stop-shopping \"documentary\" originally produced for the Sci-Fi Channel as a tie-in marketing tool. Entirely fictionalized,Curse of the Blair Witchfocuses both on the past and the present, with copious info on the Blair Witch myth as well as on the disappearance of Heather, Josh, and Mike. As it turns out, the original witch was one Elly Kedward, who was accused in 1785 of taking blood from several children; she was subsequently banished to the harsh winter woods and left for dead. Her grisly and bloody legacy involves missing children, polluted water, disemboweled men, and a serial killer of children who claims to have been haunted by \"an old woman ghost.\" Aside from some ineffective \"newsreel\" footage of the serial killer, all this intriguing information is presented convincingly and chillingly.Cursemay in fact freak you out more than the movie, and it evokes the great, pulpyIn Search Ofseries of the '70s, one of the prime inspirations for filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez. News clips of the search for Heather, Josh, and Mike lend a v&eacute;rit&eacute; atmosphere to the proceedings, but shed little light on their mysterious disappearance or their characters. Basically, it's a tease to go see the movie.

He's John  Witting (Jack Palance), father of Jacob (Walken), and the two men have not  seen each other since John abandoned his son years ago. Reconciliation comes  hard, punctuated by cliffhanger disasters (Jacob breaks his leg and burns  with a fever, Sarah almost dies in a heavy snowstorm), but this most brutal of trial periods for the Wittings still invites a viewer to yearn for a more  innocent--perhaps mythical--time in America.

Alex (Daniel Bruhl) and his sister Ariane (Maria Simon) live in East Germany with their single mother, Christiane (Katrin Sass) who is a staunch Socialist. When Alex's mother witnesses his arrest on a protest march, she suffers a heart attack and falls into a coma for eight months, just enough time for the Berlin Wall to come tumbling down, along with all of East Germany's ideals. Eight months later, Christiane wakes up and things have changed. The doctors warn Alex that any shock could bring on a fatal heart attack. He then realizes he must convince his mother that her beloved Communism has not been overthrown but is in fact triumphing over Capitalism. Alex then sets out to recreate every detail of the old East inside the four walls of their tiny council flat ... what begins as a little white lie soon turns into a major deception with hilarious consequences!", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000021Y77", "B000OVLBGC", "B0012QE4PI", "6302020816", "B005HP2IYE", "B0030Y1282", "B002BWP4A6", "B00792DYYQ", "B000P46QTA", "B000H5V8H2", "B00005U8EN", "B000YKT4BW", "0767802470", "B0045ZAQSM", "B0009VND0E", "B0009RCPUC", "B001F0TM2Q", "B00ID8H8EW", "B002KECJZ8", "B00008978K", "B0070YPWAW", "B00103584Y", "B001DB6J82", "B0001US47U", "B0037A4ILC", "B000I6BJ56", "B000063UQS", "B002BWP3UC", "B000TGCR38", "B0036TGSJE", "B00007KQ9X", "B002IVDLGY", "B00EO2I6QK", "B00280QNK6", "B000AOEPKC", "B000TLONGW", "B00F6SHGF8", "B00005JLQW", "B000065V3C", "B00005YUO1", "B009XTF8NI", "B00BSTVGHS", "B001D1F8N4", "B00006JMQG", "B002RB56YU", "B00GS08X2S", "B00005JKH5", "B001MVYUPM", "B002AG2NTI", "B00AZMFKXK", "B0030Y11Q0", "048647626X", "B0006IIKRQ", "B000934FC2", "1492399493", "B0013D8LCW", "B00005QFE6", "B00005JNCZ", "B000AM6ODK", "B0007NBJHI", "B000K2UEDG", "B000GRU8TK", "B000093NQZ", "B002M2T1VI", "B0012S6396", "B004SUDQ72", "1497362431", "B001BHTN90", "6305972761", "0060786140", "1572226897", "B0040QYROA", "B0019UGYAU", "B00E1RTCE8", "B000GFLEEA", "B0001VO38S", "B00GN13CLE", "B000N3T0DW", "B0006SJ3IQ", "B000BP3ATW", "1494337614", "B0013HL6ES", "B003B3O5IG", "B004SIP8W0", "048642474X", "B000PGTNFM", "159869989X", "B00005JLSK", "B004ZG5EYC", "B00019G4TQ", "B0000DZTIN", "B00080Z53O", "B00006G8G3", "0395040892", "B000HC2PLS", "B00006JU6Y", "B00005O06L", "B004XVMCMG", "B00007J5VT", "1571134689"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000OVLBGC", "B000021Y77", "B000YKT4BW", "B0009RCPUC"]}, "price": 6.36, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1009977}, "asin": "7040267373", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51uNDYn6ZYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Good Bye Lenin!

{"description": "High quality DVD manufactured in Hong Kong. Dialog in original English with optional subtitles in Chinese and English. On screen menus are in English and Chinese and are easy to use. Very clear full screen color image. The following review was written for the VHS version: It's been said that this 1948 classic has been responsible for the ballet lessons of more young girls than any other film. It's not hard to understand why: Michael Powell and Emerich Pressburger's dark fairy tale presents the ballet as an exquisite, magical work of art; but under the theatrics and glory is an all-consuming lifestyle with the power to destroy those who love it perhaps too much. Moira Shearer practically glows as Victoria \"Vicky\" Page, a young woman consumed by a will to dance who is accepted into the highly prestigious ballet company run by perfectionist Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook). Meanwhile, a gifted young composer, Julian Craster (Marius Goring), is brought on board as an orchestra coach, and later conductor and composer of the ballet that will make Vicky's name: The Red Shoes, one of the most beautiful and dramatic dances ever captured on film. Professional and personal jealousies soon pull this creative team apart, however, and Vicky is torn between her love of Julian, her responsibility to Boris, and her need to dance. Powell and Pressburger recast Hans Christian Andersen's sad story as a modern romantic melodrama, highlighted by beautiful dances and shot, not as stage ballets, but rather as expressionist cinematic dramas on impossibly grand sets awash with bold color and beautifully captured in glorious Technicolor by cinematographer Jack Cardiff. It's a brilliant melding of dance and drama as Vicky's real life mirror's the tragic story she danced in the Red Shoes ballet. --Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003ICZW7I", "B00008YOFG", "B00AQ6J64O", "B00004XQMY", "B004M66YUS", "B002TOL4E6", "B001IZNIV4", "B004NWPY3E", "B003N2CVOU", "B00007L4I6", "B00JAGF9Y2", "0780022629", "B000G5SIBM", "B000AQKUH2", "6305820767", "B00CYLZC4M", "B000FILVNM", "B000KRNGN6", "B005HK13S6", "B003ZYU3U0", "B0019X400I", "B001D8W7EU", "B001WLMOL4", "B0006GQMBY", "B00K6D1RO4", "B007N5YJPC", "B000025RE7", "B000BYA4HY", "B00005JLV7", "B00DZP1C9K", "B001LMU19G", "B000305ZYS", "B000AYEI9A", "B000BB1MGO", "B00B2BYY1W", "0780022343", "B001LMU1C8", "B005152C82", "B008CJ0JS4", "B0012Z361M", "B005CM1IOI", "B00EOBB6JA", "B00005NC66", "B005VU9LP4", "B000GDH9JQ", "B00005UQ7T", "B004WJT5G0", "B001M9ELJY", "B002LVF2H2", "B009NUHL8M", "B000NOK0HG", "B000E5LEV0", "B000BC8SWE", "B00AEFXD1O", "B0035ECHIG", "B00JAQJMJ0", "0780021134", "B000G8NXYG", "B000093NR0", "B00A01CQIS", "B00005JNIU", "B00AEBB89C", "B0007989ZC", "B0007PALVQ", "B004NWPY20", "0780021320", "B00005AUKD", "B009NYF2GQ", "B00AATV07S", "B005H8G78O", "B00DHN8FXG", "B00008AOWJ", "B00478ED2C", "B0000YEEHG", "B00005BCK0", "B0087ZG7R0", "B00HCSO9O6", "B003XMKMVE", "B000063N9O", "B00DHN8GGW", "6305416222", "B001D8W7F4", "B00K5EJHGO", "6305257450", "B001D8W7EK", "B0001V6ZJ8", "B005DI9906", "B001BEK8E2", "B00065GX64", "B00K6D1QV8", "B000TXNDV6", "B004NWPY7A", "B000QGE8JC", "B001D261ES", "B00H9HZITU", "B009NUHP24", "B003LMPKSQ", "B0001XAOPM", "B0009S4IJW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003N2CVOU", "B00007L4I6", "B001QOGYBI", "B00005QAPH"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 668756}, "asin": "7883062603", "imUrl": "http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-site/icons/no-img-sm._CB192198896_.gif", "title": "The Red Shoes directed by Michael Powell (Import)"}

{"description": "Described by its maker, Jean-Luc Godard, as \"Alice in Wonderland meets Franz Kafka,\" this 1964 film noir stars Anna Karina as a naive woman who takes up with couple of would-be bad guys (Claude Brasseur, Sami Frey) in a disastrous effort to rob her aunt of a fortune. Along the way, the motley group joins the Godardian (and Hollywood gangster) tradition of characters who walk a line between reality and invention, in this case distracting themselves by running around the Louvre, taking a stab at learning English, stumbling through some dance steps, and reenacting the death of Billy the Kid. A uniquely spontaneous work in Godard's canon,Band of Outsidersalso continues the Brechtian strain in the director's merged relationship with Karina, his then-wife and artistic muse. Yet it is also more buoyantly unpredictable in its sense of romantic doom than any of the director's movies since his seminal debut,Breathless(also a gangster film, not coincidentally).--Tom Keogh", "price": 19.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 572174}, "asin": "B000007T1D", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21RNS24HB9L.jpg", "title": "Band of Outsiders [VHS]"}

{"description": "Kingdom Hospitalis horror novelist Stephen King's adaptation of Danish director Lars Von Trier's cult miniseriesThe Kingdom, geared very much for an American audience. The story unfolds across 15 hours, telling the story of a hospital in Maine that's been built on the site of a 19th-century mill fire that killed most of its young occupants--themes that King fans will be familiar with. In the present day, Kingdom Hospital is haunted by the ghost of 10-year-old child worker Mary and, even more bizarrely, a fearsome giant anteater-like creature called Antubis. It falls to the ace doctor Hook (Andrew McCarthy), the paraplegic artist Jack Coleman (Peter Rickman), and the hypochondriac psychic Sally Druse (Diane Ladd) to enlist the help of a surreal assortment of hospital staff and patients to help Mary and save Kingdom Hospital itself from certain doom.Fans of Stephen King will probably enjoy the blend of black comedy, spectral horror, and general weirdness, which owes a big debt to previous television series likeTwin Peaksand evenER. But too often,Kingdom Hospitalseems to be trying too hard to make itself into a cult series, something which King is just not a subtle enough writer to carry off. ButKingdom Hospitallooks good, especially the CGI Antubis, who steals every scene in which he appears. Generally, though, the series is more of an entertaining experiment than a cult-in-the-making.--Ted Kord", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000C2IQQ", "B000063US5", "B000G1R39E", "B006J8NPAE", "B000GYI340", "B0007WFXNA", "B00005UQ9V", "B000U1ZV6W", "1573625779", "B0002OXVG4", "B00009OWI3", "B00BW4S8AC", "B000053UIF", "6305120021", "6305645574", "B008QE9Z8A", "B00BW4S89S", "B00BW4S87U", "0767821599", "0792841328", "B0010X73ZG", "B000077VRT", "B0001FVDQ4", "B00APQLJTA", "B000TJ6PBK", "B0007NFMB2", "B00AEBB91E", "B000068IES", "B00006FDCD", "1573626910", "B00AEBB91O", "B00005LQ0Q", "B00AEFYV9W", "B0002O7XW2", "B0002A2VK0", "B000AMJG58", "B00BTYPW7C", "B003L2M584", "B000RZIGUE", "B00AEFXR8I", "B00IYJRIKO", "630523650X", "B000ATQYXI", "B0053TWVDC", "B0033HKCV4", "B000AA4JNO", "B0053TWV46", "B00HAJUWMK", "B0052XU4BK", "B005CFBZVG", "B000AYYV74", "B00DII0MGI", "B00005K3NR", "0790742829", "B000H4JH7Q", "B000N3T0EG", "B000GBEWRU", "B0084MVE7E", "B00C2CDJ34", "B0002234LS", "B001B18748", "B00005O439", "B0056GLNQI", "B00A1AU72A", "B000MMMTD2", "B000FOPPBA", "0756905753", "B0091G7BTM", "B00D97DMBU", "B00B04NIZO", "B004BZ5AHI", "B0007CEXUY", "B00006FDCU", "B002GHHHG0", "B005TFVEVU", "B001J4E19C", "B000A1OG1S", "B000069I05", "B00005JOJE", "B003VJTGNE", "B004WO9OMA", "B000K4X5P8", "B001CY5N00", "1579402356", "B0002J4ZX2", "B006QWC2ZC", "B008DVJOQ4", "B004SIP92O", "B002VWNIDG", "B0004Z31OS", "B0041H55SK", "B000FFJZO2", "0743289412", "B001CDLATO", "B000GG4XWE", "B001A7GOCA", "B000P0J0EM", "1476770387", "B000RIWAV2"], "bought_together": ["B000063US5", "B0000C2IQQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000063US5", "B0000C2IQQ", "B00BW4S8AC", "B000GYI340"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30657}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 9.95, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00000F3SB", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512S8XMQ4SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Kingdom Hospital"}

{"description": "Clifton Webb brings the imperious fussiness that made him a prissy film noir icon in such films asLauraandThe Dark Cornerto the role of Lynn Belvedere, the self-proclaimed genius who takes a position nannying a trio of bratty boys. This professed child-hating bachelor proves to be a godsend for flustered parents Maureen O'Hara and Robert Young. Within days his unconventional mix of child psychology and strict discipline tames the three rambunctious boys--faced with an infant who insists on spattering him with oatmeal, he simply dumps the bowl on the tyke's head. The trouble in paradise begins when a snoopy neighbor spreads gossip about an affair between Belvedere and the mother of the house, which sends hot-headed Dad into a tizzy, but just as things look their darkest Belvedere turns the tables on the neighborhood when the real reason of his suburban relocation is revealed. Director Walter Lang underplays his hand so much that the film takes on all the style of a 1950s TV sitcom, but his fine direction of performers brings out the humor of this middle-class satire with warmth and wit. Ultimately, however, the film belongs to Webb, whose witheringly snide insults and cutting comments roll off his tongue with comic effortlessness. He proved so popular that he starred in a pair of sequels:Mr. Belvedere Goes to CollegeandMr. Belvedere Rings the Bell.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0089BSMDY", "B00000JL7T", "B0089BSLWQ", "B0007ZEOQE", "B00013RCAM", "B00008LDNZ", "B0007PALVQ", "B00092ZLEE", "6302215730", "6303037445", "6302182867", "6302477379", "6301968972", "6302136237", "6303072798", "6302241065", "6303072372"], "bought_together": ["B0089BSLWQ", "B0089BSMDY"], "also_viewed": ["B0089BSMDY", "B00BY8D9UU", "B00013RCAM", "B0086CDKYM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 86436}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 29.9, "brand": "", "asin": "B00000IBMB", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DPHSC58DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sitting Pretty [VHS]"}

{"description": "Murder (1930 | B&W;) 92 min.One of Hitchcock's most frequent techniques was to have his characters get caught up in a web of confusion and chaos that is totally beyond their control. That concept works so very well because most people can readily identify with it. In Murder, Diana Baring is an actress who is caught standing over the corpse of a fellow actress. Even worse, she has amnesia and remembers nothing about the murder, or herself. Though she desperately tries to recall anything that can clear the fog from her mind, her amnesia is complete, as is the evidence against her. She is convicted of murder and sentenced to die. Only one person believes she is innocent, but can he prove it in time to save her? In addition to many inventive cinematic techniques created by Hitchcock for Murder was the director's presentation of a character's thoughts on the soundtrack, the first time this had been done in a sound film.  Hitchcock achieved this effect by improvising brilliantly: he had Marshall prerecord his lines on a wire tape recorder, and the director played the recording back while shooting a scene of the silent Marshall shaving. Behind the bathroom wall was hidden a live 35-piece orchestra playing the prelude to \"Tristan and Isolde,\" the music supposedly coming from the radio.Includes an introduction by Tony Curtis and a bonus clip of the original theatrical trailer from Hitchcock's 1948 film, \"Rope,\" Starring James Stewart and Farley Granger.Digitally Mastered from the best available sources for the highest quality possible.MENU languages:  English / Spanish / Chinese / JapaneseSubtitles:  Spanish / Chinese / JapaneseThis product is manufactured on demand using DVD-R recordable media.

{"description": "A confident hybrid ofM*A*S*H,Treasure of the Sierra Madre, andDr. Strangelove,Three Kingsis one of the most seriously funny war movies ever made. Improving the premise ofKelly's Heroeswith scathing intelligence, it explores the odd connection between war and consumerism in the age of Humvees and cellular phones. Writer-director David O.&nbsp;Russell's third film (afterSpanking the MonkeyandFlirting with Disaster), it's a no-holds-barred portrait of personal conscience in the volatile arena of politics, played out by one of the most gifted filmmakers to emerge in the 1990s.George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, and Spike Jonze (director ofBeing John Malkovich) play a quartet of U.S.&nbsp;soldiers who, disillusioned by Operation Desert Storm, decide to steal $23&nbsp;million in gold hijacked from Kuwait by Saddam Hussein's army. Getting the bullion out of an Iraqi stronghold is easy; keeping it is a potentially lethal proposition. By the end of their mercenary mission, the Americans can no longer ignore wartime atrocities (and neither can we--the film is boldly unflinching), and conscience demands their aid to Kuwaiti rebels abandoned by President George Bush's fickle wartime policy. This is serious stuff indeed, but Russell infusesThree Kingswith a keen sense of the absurd, and the entire film is an exercise in breathtaking visual ingenuity. Despite a conventional ending that's mildly disappointing for such a brashly original film,Three Kingsconveys the brutal madness of war while making you laugh out loud at the insanity.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00DON8NJ0", "B000IYV1ME", "B000O7667K", "B000H1RFKU", "B003ASLJOK", "B000JU7KAE", "B001G8XOMG", "B00DON4TPC", "B001O7JHSO", "B0046BHC6O", "B0021L8URQ", "B001XURJCS", "B001CT877G", "B0013FSXT6", "B002ZG97QU", "B0047BXR1W", "B001HN69CC", "B000JLPMPI", "B000HLDFK4", "B000TGGJKU", "B003L7DK60", "B001AQT0RC", "B001J6NZGU", "B0011VIODW", "B000Q7ZND6", "B000P6XU60", "B000H1RFKK", "B001FB55M6", "B0017TYPIG", "B000O176IO", "B0011E5D2Y", "B000KF0NI4", "B000Q6GX90", "B000LPS4BG", "B000M5AJQI", "B000JUB7LW", "B0015GDVTU", "B000UJ48UO", "B002Z7FM68", "B000I5XOWI", "B000MEYFXW", "B0012YYZYK", "B000PC0U1W", "B003YOZNBK", "B001NCDCQ8", "B000JLSLZQ", "B000R3PDK2", "B001FB55H6", "B0010HOZXA", "B003B1X80Y", "B000JLSM00", "B001O7JHW0", "B006H3MIYA", "B000MQ54OY", "B003UESJHY", "B000Q66J1M", "B006OQ0K0E", "B003TT2X6S", "B001OQCUZW", "B003TT2X6I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B006H3MIYA", "B002T9H2L0", "B003KGBIS4", "B00HF98SY4"]}, "price": 8.5, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1098395}, "asin": "B00003CX73", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BA5ATJSYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Three Kings"}

{"description": "To callPearl Harbora throwback to old-time war movies is something of an understatement. Director Michael Bay's epic take on the bombing that brought the United States into World War II hijacks every war movie situation and clich&#xE9; (some affectionate, some stale) you've ever seen and gives them a shiny, glossy spin until the whole movie practically gleams. Planes glisten, water sparkles, trees beckon--and Bay's re-creation of the bombing itself, a 30-minute sequence that's tightly choreographed and amazingly photographed, sets the action movie bar up quite a few notches. And in updating the classic war film, Bay and screenwriter Randall Wallace (Braveheart) use that old plot standby, the love triangle--this time, it's between two pilots (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) and a nurse (Kate Beckinsale) who find themselves stationed at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, during what they thought would be a nice, sunny tour of duty. Then, of course, history intervened.For the first 90 minutes of the movie, Affleck and Beckinsale find a nice, appealing chemistry that plays on his strengths as a movie star and hers as a serious actress--he gives her glamour, she gives him smarts. Their truncated romance--the beginning of which is told in flashback so we can get right to the point where he has to leave her to go to England--works, thanks to their charm. They're no Kate and Leo fromTitanic(a strategy the film strives hard toward), but they're pretty darn adorable in their own right. Hartnett, as the not entirely unwelcome third wheel, squints bravely but makes only a slight dent in the film. Everyone else inPearl Harbor--from Cuba Gooding Jr.'s brave navy seaman to Jon Voight's able impersonation of FDR--is pretty much a glorified walk-on, taking a backseat to the pyrotechnics and action sequences that keep the three-hour film in fairly constant motion. But when that action does take hold,Pearl Harboris quite a thrilling ride.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792151712", "B000059HGY", "B00000K3AN", "B00AEBBA36", "0792133153", "079212569X", "6305169187", "6301734734", "0792147618", "0792116887", "6304618344", "079213690X", "6303269834", "6304925131", "6305718792", "6304259131", "B00004WIDB", "6304935811", "6303057225", "6304143184", "6302250269"], "bought_together": ["B00000K3AN", "B00AEBBA36"], "also_viewed": ["B00000G3PA", "0792151712", "6300213668", "B00000JS61", "6303215734", "6303402348", "B00004WIDB", "079213690X", "6305750750", "B004751DFU", "B00005O893", "B00000K3AN", "6301792734", "B00E5I2MCM", "6305169187", "B00007LVCM", "B007SPPANM", "B00L4K3MLE", "B00FLML7HW", "B008QZ5PY2", "B00JBGWP3Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 234413}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.49, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXTF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HC1ZDJN6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "When 12-year-old Renato, riding through his small Italian town on his new bicycle, sees the voluptuous Mal&egrave;na, little does he know he's launching on an infatuation that will carry him through the tumultuous days of World War II.Mal&egrave;nabegins as an enraptured depiction of Renato's adolescent mind--the way he stares, hypnotized, at Mal&egrave;na's garters pressing through the material of her tight skirt, or his frustrated rebellion against the indignity of wearing short pants--but soon transforms into a portrait of small-town prejudice. Mal&egrave;na's looks spark lust and envy in the townspeople; when her husband dies in combat, the gossip only intensifies, to the point that Mal&egrave;na is dragged into court to defend herself against accusations of adultery. When the women of the town refuse to sell her edible food at the market, Mal&egrave;na has little choice but to become what she's been unjustly accused of being. At the end, a twist of fate turns this tale of longing and jealousy into a heartbreaking love story. Monica Bellucci exudes the can't-help-it eroticism that makes Mal&egrave;na such a lightning rod for everyone's desires; she's like a more zaftig Isabelle Adjani. The movie seems to wander at times, but the ending has a powerful emotional impact.

{"description": "Ronald, the klutzy high-school brain played by Buster Keaton inCollege, is an inspired variation on the insulated millionaire playboys of earlier films. This bookish mama's boy who couldn't throw a fit, let alone a football, vows to become a college athlete to win the heart of the campus sweetheart. Of course in this path lies disaster, and his follies in track and field (the flyweight tries to throw the hammer and winds up flinging himself) only increase when he's made coxswain of the rowing team. Keaton's mix of energetic earnestness and flailing incompetence make his athletic tryout the film highlight, but in classic Keaton fashion Mr. Two Left Feet becomes the world's greatest athlete to save his sweetie from a bullying muscle-bound brute, mastering every event he so hilariously botched earlier in a decathlon dash to the rescue. This episodic comedy is more like his early shorts than his best features, lacking the narrative backbone that supports such masterpieces asThe GeneralandSteamboat Bill, Jr., but it's full of inspired physical comedy and Keaton's unique brand of gymnastic genius. Also featured are three short films:The Haunted House, with bank teller Buster matching wits against robbers in a gadget-filled hideout; the recently rediscoveredHard Luck, which recounts Buster's unsuccessful efforts to end it all (the missing conclusion is reconstructed from stills); andThe Blacksmith, where Buster disastrously attempts to apply assembly line efficiency to a village smithy.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305701245", "B000021Y7N", "6305609942", "B001E18222", "B003H221MI", "B0041CGOZ8", "B0000214GC", "B005SDB8H8", "B0006Z2KXO", "B008BWFOXC", "0810942275", "B00004Z4W3", "B0002CHIFG", "B0056HTEKO", "B000021Y7O", "0520256670", "B0002HOEJY", "6305131139", "B0085A9K3K"], "bought_together": ["6305609942"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AOCDE7U"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 372479}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.96, "brand": "Kino International", "asin": "B00003ETHH", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21V6K9PTZFL.jpg", "title": "College"}

{"description": "The primary appeal of dance movies is the dancing, with some added emphasis on the romance the art expresses.Center Stagewins on these counts, despite its reveling in overly familiar characters and formula plotting. Or maybe this reveling is responsible for what goofy fun this film is. The arduous task of becoming a professional ballet dancer is incarnated by many good-looking teens, all stock dance-film characters affectionately portrayed mostly by newcomers. But center stage holds Jody Sawyer (Amanda Schull), who may never be a great ballerina, but she's certainly one sexy jazz dancer. Then there's the arrogant genius (Ethan Stiefel), the dictatorial impresario (Peter Gallagher), the demanding instructor, the bulimic, the stage mother, etc. As we follow these characters, the message develops that one should let go and do what feels good. Jody may not be ballet material, but she scorches the stage when she's uninhibited. And that's really the fun of this movie, which is never seriously interested in ballet to begin with. One ludicrous scene depicts one of the dancers quitting because she realizes she never wanted to be a dancer to begin with but was pushed into it by her overbearing mother. She stands up to mom in the lobby of the auditorium where she's supposed to be performing, the music of her piece providing a syrupy backdrop to her little drama. When she's finished talking, she walks off to the audience's unwitting applause. The scene is so ham-handed you can't help but laugh at its audacity, if that's what it is. The rest of the film is not so overdone, but it's all fun.--Jim Gay", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301796535"], "bought_together": ["6301796535"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 412340}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.96, "brand": "", "asin": "B00004WMDT", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z02KG9Y5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Center Stage [VHS]"}

The \"True Patriots\" featurette is much better, examining the painstaking efforts toward authenticity in production design, artillery, and costuming.

{"description": "If you've seenScreamandI Know What You Did Last Summer, then you know the entire plot ofScary Movie. That's okay, though, because this is a parody, and it helps to know the story in order to be able to get the jokes. No, the biggest surprise here is not the  story as much as the amount of full-frontal male nudity. Really, in addition to all the dick jokes (and the ass jokes and fart jokes), there's a couple of shots of the male member, one of which is erect and used as a weapon.Scary Moviesomehow ended up with an R rating, which in a sense is groundbreaking; perhaps our ratings board is loosening up after all.But is it funny? That's the most important question, and the answer to that is yes. In the vein ofAirplane!, with a dash of the Farrelly brothers,Scary Moviekeeps throwing jokes at you one after another. The law of averages says some of them have to hit, and enough of them do to keep the movie entertaining. Unlike the makers ofAirplane!, however, the Wayans brothers aren't making this movie out of a love of the genre, and unlike the Farrelly brothers, they don't make fun of retarded people with any sort of respect, so the humor throughout feels a lot uglier. Still, there are enough funny scenes inScary Movieto make the viewing experience worthwhile. Special credit must go to Lochlyn Munro as Greg, the over-the-top jock, who steals the movie up until the time he's gotta die.--Andy Spletzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SIP9I8", "B004SIP9KQ", "B000FOQ1KY", "B00CAATSME", "B0009P42WI", "B001J710YI", "B004SIP9O2", "B00AZMFINM", "B004SIP9MY", "B0016MJ6J2", "B004SIP9P6", "B000F9RLL2", "B004LWZW2O", "B005CFBYW6", "B004P7CMZ0", "6305017115", "B005DCJ218", "B0000VCZMK", "B00177YA06", "0780631684", "B000055WFZ", "B00008K7AM", "B002IT5GDC", "B000O76ZOO", "B0002VYOVI", "B00AEFXQLQ", "B000RIWAVW", "B001NPD9LS", "B000069CF0", "B004SIP8ES", "B00441GYVA", "630529142X", "B000FA57UI", "B000AM4P9K", "B009XTF8KQ", "B002A5EBMQ", "0767811070", "B00AEFYPXY", "B00005LC4Q", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B000K405CY", "B000IFRT4W", "B0021L8UXA", "B003Q6D27S", "B000FC2HS6", "B00081912E", "B00003CY5Y", "0783235070", "B00AEFYYH6", "B00H0EN98E", "B004EPZ084", "B000FA57US", "B001P3SA9Y", "B0031U8OEK", "B00003CXPS", "B003PIUINS", "B000VKL6Z2", "B001L9EXUC", "B000WZEZGI", "B003UESJBU", "B005DEUEXQ", "B00003CXS7", "B00009PY4G", "B00BEIYGT8", "B002GHHHG0", "B006W4KVH0", "B000GBEWHK", "B00AJLHUA8", "B002ZG971U", "B000WGYMTC", "B00J5JSV3A", "B00005K3NR", "B000J4QW7W", "B001J9KJ4I", "B00003CXZ1", "B004EPZ06G", "B000V4UFZK", "B0006SSOHC", "B00001QGUM", "B000022TSW", "B00AEFYE08", "0767824954", "B000031WD9", "B00004STUL", "B00005JNZU", "B004SEUJO6", "B008R65XTC", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B00AEFY37C", "B002ZG97TW", "B00005N7Z1", "B004P7CN7W", "B00003CY6D", "B00E8RKHWW", "B00BEIYMZ6", "B008G33PIM", "B000P0J09M", "B00006FDCD", "B00AEFYQWO"], "bought_together": ["B004SIP9I8", "B004SIP9KQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FOQ1KY", "B004SIP9KQ", "B004SIP9I8", "B008MXMFVE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 150447}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.99, "brand": "Dimension", "asin": "B00004Z4WQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5123WET5P4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Scary Movie"}

{"description": "Smart-talking American astronaut John Crichton (Ben Browder) is flung through a wormhole and comes out in the midst of an interstellar prison escape on the other side of the universe. Bad luck for Crichton: the galactic cops (called \"peacekeepers\") mark him as the new public enemy number 1. This 20th-century boy is forced to ally himself with the colorful convicts: D'Argo, a hulking warrior with a fleshy Rastafarian mane; Zhaan, a blue-skinned priest of indeterminate age (played byRoad Warrioralumnus Virginia Hey); fugitive peacekeeper Aeryn (Pitch Black's Claudia Black); Rygel, a greedy and troll-like exiled king; and Pilot, the giant insect-like nerve center of their living ship, Moya. It's an impressive-looking made-for-cable series, with imaginative production design and mix of state-of-the-art digital effects and sophisticated puppetry (or rather Muppetry, courtesy of co-creator Brian Henson), but it's the sharp writing and vivid characters that have built--and kept--the show's following.Premiereintroduces each character and the basic premise, a sci-fiFugitiveby way ofVoyagerin a world far from the Federation-friendly universe ofStar Trek. Crichton's welcome is anything but warm, and the cultural and philosophical differences of the fleeing outlaws, as well as their pure self-interest, clash under the constant threat of capture. InI, E.T., a hidden homing signal forces Moya to hide in a terrestrial bog while the crew tries to disarm the device (which has been fused to the ship's nervous system), and Crichton makes first contact with the planet's pre-space flight inhabitants. \"Spielberg was all wrong,\" he remarks while dodging military patrols and soothing the fears of a sky-watching scientist. Well-timed to fill the void left byBabylon 5, this is the promising start of a fresh sci-fi franchise.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000056VRD", "B0006FO9B0", "B00005AMQS", "B00005M91F", "B00005NVHT", "B0000639E1", "B00005UO7R", "B00005R23R", "B00005MEUR", "B00000F6RL"], "bought_together": ["B000056VRD", "B0006FO9B0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002GP7ZWI", "B002GP7ZV4", "B0006FO9B0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 366079}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "", "asin": "B0000541X6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZT8EF046L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Farscape Season 1, Vol. 1 - Premiere/I, E.T."}

{"description": "With great aplomb--and the tag line \"You'll Believe a Man Can Fly\"--DC Comics' Superman met with movie magic in 1978. The film featured Oscar-winning flying effects, John Williams's soaring music, and an innovative title sequence, and audiences ate it up, along with its thrilling sequel. Director Richard Donner's casting of the then-unknown Christopher Reeve couldn't have been better--the towering Reeve fit the suit and cape masterfully, but his real weapon was making the bumbling Clark Kent into an endearing leading man instead of the dry counterpoint to the Man of Steel that Kent had been in earlier film versions. Although most critics lean toward Richard Lester'sSuperman II(1980) as the series high point, which offered an endearing love story between the Man of Steel and Lois Lane (Margot Kidder), Donner's first film also deserves just praise in setting the old-fashioned cornball tone for the series and providing Superman's backstory from planet Krypton (featuring a high-priced Marlon Brando as Superman's father). The last two sequels lose much of the magic: 1983'sSuperman IIIseems to have been produced only to showcase red-hot comic Richard Pryor as a computer hack turned supervillain, and Reeve himself came up with the story line for 1987'sSuperman IV: The Quest for Peace, a silly attempt to impart a meaningful message of nuclear disarmament. Throughout the films, the supporting cast is first-rate, with old pros like Valerie Perrine, Jackie Cooper, and Ned Beatty having a grand old time. Even better are the villains, especially Terence Stamp as General Zod and Gene Hackman in his lightest, funniest work ever as Lex Luthor.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000J10EQU", "B002GSXKN8", "B00003CXC5", "B000ION23U", "B001CDR1FG", "B000PE0G0A", "B000P6XQ50", "B001DHXT20", "B001F3FUK6", "B000IJ79WU", "B000P0J06U", "B000IJ79VQ", "B000HCO83Q", "B00008WFU4", "B000VI70QS", "B00595W3Q0", "B007STBUHI", "B001OST0M6", "B00005JNTU", "B000P0J04W", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000OVLBF8", "B0007P0Y7C", "B00D7AM6M0", "B001ECDVH2", "B008JFUPFI", "B003YAR97K", "B001LK8SQ6", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001OST0LW", "B0057RCFQS", "B000IJ79UW", "B005LAIGW8", "B00E5I2MEK", "6305428514", "B000VWYJ86", "B0013527K2", "B000HT3P6U", "B000P0J06K", "B0054OGQM8", "B000VKL6Z2", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00005JMQW", "B000ASATYY", "B000WC3864", "B00008WFU5", "B000AYELVU", "B002GHHHOM", "B00005LOUK", "B004LWZW42", "B0006L0L5C", "B001MWUWU8", "B001JV5BF8", "B00E5I2M9K", "B000CS1Z6S", "B000VIU0NI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000P6XQ50", "B00F4FFO8E", "B008JFUPFI", "B000IJ79VQ"]}, "price": 26.05, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 154256}, "asin": "B000059Z8L", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EB5XYD5HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Complete Superman Collection"}

{"description": "With its modest special effects, lean plot, and small cast of lesser  stars, this 1951 thriller remains a sturdy blueprint for fusing horror and  science fiction. The formula has been employed countless times since, fleshed  out with more extensive and elaborate production values, and manned by higher profiled marquee names, but the results have yet to improve onThe Thing from Another World, Howard Hawks's lone foray into sci-fi.The story begins as military airmen are dispatched to a remote Arctic research station where scientists have detected the crash of a spacecraft.  An effort to retrieve the saucer-shaped vehicle fails, but the team returns to the station with the frozen body of its sole occupant. When the extraterrestrial pilot is accidentally thawed, the crew, headed by a tough-talking pilot (Kenneth Tobey), grapples with a massive, chlorophyll-based humanoid (James Arness) thirsty for blood and in no mood for galactic diplomacy.Hawks takes only a production credit for this low-budget exercise, but his filmmaking style transcends Christian Nyby's nominal direction: rapid-fire, overlapping dialogue, an ensemble of comrades whose professionalism is tempered by wisecracks, and unsentimental female characters (embodied by feisty romantic interest Margaret Sheridan) recall Hawks's signature works, while propelling the plot over any potential gaps in credibility. It's hardly surprising, then, thatThe Thing from Another Worldremains among the most influential science fiction movies ever shot, or that it remains exciting entertainment a half century later.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKFR", "0783240953", "6303257801", "6302120101", "B00007JME0", "B000AQKU72", "B000DZC5PA", "B007Y1NNAW", "6300183084", "B00005R1O7", "6302890721", "0790731975", "6304507348", "0792835077", "6301977742", "0783236352", "6301977149", "6301968948", "6300208508", "B0000068SI", "B000JTATHG", "6301661729", "6304429274", "6300247589", "0790752395", "6302526191", "B000HDNPM0", "6303398375", "630442972X", "6303953492", "6302763835", "6301976401", "0783103107", "6300215539", "6302843200", "630168740X", "6300213900", "6300216500", "6300181278", "6302841798", "6300213838", "6302182530", "6300269477", "6300185281", "6300247597", "6301562178", "0790736055", "6300182533", "6300181340", "B00004R67T", "630258793X", "6303082815"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKFR", "B007Y1NNAW"], "also_viewed": ["B0067QPVJ6", "6300182878", "B000FOPPEC", "6303506291", "B00005JKFR", "6300247171", "B0045HCJKS", "B00AEBB8VK", "B00IYJFB2G"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 345640}, "asin": "B00005JG70", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5120YBRYW7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Thing From Another World [VHS]"}

Now, as Maud and Roland embark on a wildly romantic journey in search of the truth, the mystery of the past will engulf them, as the passions of the present possess them.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SUDQ22", "B000BOH904", "0679735909", "B00AEBB8P6", "B001RJ1Y62", "B004SIP7AS", "6305692696", "B000JJ5G4W", "B00I6JODGO", "B00005JOA0", "B002AT8KAG", "B006YTGL3G", "B004XVMCMQ", "B00005JMJD", "B00HUAGZ34", "0767812115", "0800141660", "B00005ALMM", "B000ZS8GW6", "B000Z27HLS", "B002ZFEQ76", "B004499LWG", "B005T0OY5S", "B004SIP9U6", "B00005OBAL", "0788815490", "B004SIP7D0", "B000EBD9VC", "B004SEUIZG", "B00006FD9P", "B000784WNQ", "B000N4SHOE", "B000EDWLTQ", "B004P7CNZO", "B00003JRCQ", "B0080QOL10", "B004AE3QYE", "B00AF82WTO", "B004U7MQZ6", "B00G6HO368", "B00005LOKU", "B006YTGL86", "B00F1BFRA6", "B0001US61O", "B0064MT1U8", "B005CFC0HE", "B004BZ5AGY", "B004P7CMUU", "B004SIP8JI", "0790730979", "0767020308", "B0018M6J90", "B000F3UAFC", "B00005JPSM", "B000LPQ6DE", "B001C4AFOY", "B0000372I3", "B004JMSIQS", "0767847415", "B006GL8NTW", "B002WY65VA", "0767806786", "B007A2O3FO", "B00GS08Y3Q", "B0001US7Q8", "B0000AQS3P", "0767815718", "B00023BKO0", "B00062IZ0Y", "0826452485", "B000E1ZBGS", "B00B89WZG4", "B000BITVAG", "B0045O2PHS", "B00AZMFO6I", "B00CIOD6HK", "0790732947", "B0080QOL1A", "B004QDRW0S", "B00JAQJMJ0", "0679738290", "B002I5GNZQ", "B0000844LU", "B003EA45EA", "B0007NFLO0", "B009T6CXG0", "B000CEV3M8", "B000M2E32M", "B00005YUNK", "B000NOIX48", "B000085OY1", "B00004WI57", "B00003CXC9", "B00AKGG6JS", "B001L57ZZG", "B004EQAVHI", "B0001GOH7K", "0783239416", "B00G7QPXAI", "B0046ZYEUW"], "bought_together": ["B000BOH904", "B00AEBB8P6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0679735909", "B000BOH904", "B00AEBB8P6", "B004SUDQ22"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 39150}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.41, "brand": "PALTROW,GWYNETH", "asin": "B00005JKKY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51220SPRBNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Possession"}
{"description": "Antoine Fuqua (THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS, BAIT) turns up the intensity level with TRAINING DAY, a charged drama about police corruption in downtown Los Angeles. Ethan Hawke stars as Jake Hoyt, a well-intentioned young officer who thinks he's found his ticket to becoming a detective in the form of undercover officer Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Harris is a notorious figure in the streets and in the office. He also has the authority to make Jake's professional wishes come true, provided Jake is able to prove his worth on Alonzo's team. At first, Alonzo's blunt, carefree demeanor provides a shock to Jake's optimistic system, but as it becomes clear that Alonzo is dangerously out of control, Jake must decide whether or not to risk his future in the name of the law.\n\nWashington's performance as the evil, pragmatic detective is a sight to behold. He delivers his lines with a devilish ferocity that keeps the film bubbling throughout. Hawke slips into the role of the rookie everyman with ease, providing a good contrast to Washington's fiery presence. Former video director Fuqua completes the picture by casting musicians Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and Macy Gray in supporting roles.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792841778", "630268644X", "6303012140", "6300214826"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 428216}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.0, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005JKEC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/415AYTB1GNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Training Day [VHS]"}
{"description": "Director Frank Darabont created this Frank Capra-inspired drama based on a screenplay by his friend and one-time schoolmate Michael Sloane. Jim Carrey stars as Pete Appleton, a screenwriter in the Hollywood of the 1950s. Pete's on top of the world with his first motion picture \"Sand Pirates of the Sahara\" just released to theaters and his romance with a beautiful starlet (Amanda Detmer) heating up. However, his triumph turns to dismay when he's called before the commie-hunting House Un-American Activities Committee and advised by a studio lawyer and his agent to play ball with the witch hunters. Depressed by the film industry's weak-kneed reaction to the hearings, Pete gets drunk and drives his car north along the California coast, where he crashes from a bridge and wakes up on shore the next morning suffering from amnesia. Wandering into the nearby small town of Lawson, Pete is mistaken for Luke Trimble, a lost hero of World War II who, like most of the area's young men, never returned from the war a decade earlier. \"Luke\" has soon reunited with both his father (Martin Landau) and his one-time girlfriend (Laurie Holden), and finds that his reappearance has given the citizens of Lawson an emotional boost that's sorely needed. When he refurbishes and reopens his family's decrepit movie theater, the Majestic, Luke revitalizes Lawson just as his memory of his true identity begins to reassert itself. Sloane's original script for The Majestic (2001) was entitled The Bijou.", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 298103}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.75, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005JKNB", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GZ710HSNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Majestic [VHS]"}

{"description": "Keanu Reeves stars in this story that might best be described asBad News Bearsin the projects. Conor O'Neill (Reeves) is a charming ne'er-do-well with a disturbing gambling addiction. His penchant for betting on the wrong teams leaves him owing several thousand dollars to very violent people, and he ends up coaching a children's baseball team to pay off his debt. The movie skimps a bit on process: the kids start out as terrible players and become better but we don't see how; Conor starts caring but we don't see why. As by-the-numbers movies go, though, it isn't a bad one. The young actors in the cast are talented and understated. Most of the kids' characters are only barely fleshed out by the script, but this keeps the movie from being hijacked by extra-cute mugging. Parents should be cautioned--this movie has some very violent scenes that will frighten young children, and swearing is depicted as precocious and adorable. Still, like a baseball game, it isn't a bad way to spend your time.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000KHYN9C", "B00004Y2R1", "B00AMEZDJW", "B00000JGHV", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B002O3Z4XY", "B00AEFXOKO", "B0000633U2", "6305505780", "B00005JPK8", "B004GJYROG", "B0012YYZDG", "B00009AOAX", "078324021X", "B00003CY51", "B00AEFYE08", "B002GIBVWA", "B00005M20J", "B00E1HIWU8", "B0006J28MI", "B005SQRYEG", "B001DJLD12", "B0007LLPXI", "630514415X", "B000068NNU", "B0000JBUHI", "B003VE9WTW", "B00AEFXHNI", "B00DW5IKW0", "B000089771", "B000BITV9W", "1558908390", "B0001MMGC2", "B000089778", "B0010YSD90", "B000056VP4", "B00066FAQW", "B00005A3KS", "B00E1HIX66", "B00005JLG1", "B00005JLRZ", "B00028HBES", "6304821832", "0788815466", "B000FS9ULC", "B00AEFXSLE", "B000069I0E", "B001BP4K22", "0783230338", "B002GSXKOM", "B0010YSD8Q", "B00ANDDBBY", "B00DNF1SSC", "B000069I1K", "630592273X", "B0006GAI5U", "B000PE0GRI", "B000EXZFCQ", "B00006SFL7", "B0060ZJ7BC", "B00006LPH6", "B004GJYRF0", "B002VWNICM", "B004499NII", "B00AEFXGWK", "B000063RQO", "B00007BK2S", "B000053VAX", "6305428271", "B000G0O5I2", "B00008979O", "B0009A40NO", "B00005NRO0", "B00DQCSWUE", "B000WD3XKO", "6305065551", "0783230524", "B004WJT5E2", "B000XSWVEC", "B0000YEE6M", "B002CA68N4", "B000MNOX9E", "B009NNM9OA", "B000089773", "B000J10F14", "B00AEBB9UU", "B0006GANOQ", "B00AEFYKWU", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00007LP8J", "B00AEFY17E", "B002NZK5U0", "B0009K7RMA", "B00595W4CI", "B00L4K3MLE", "B000HDZKLO", "B000BOH8X2", "B000FUTVLY", "B00003W8NT", "0783237367"], "bought_together": ["B00AMEZDJW", "B00004Y2R1"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AMEZDJW", "B002O3Z4XY", "B00DNF1SSC", "B005SQRYEG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10614}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.81, "brand": "Team Marketing", "asin": "B00005JKE4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R4A6RG4XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hardball"}
{"description": "The key component of this Vista Series DVD is a six-part documentary about the making of the film from idea to theatrical release. M. Night Shyamalan talks at length about the film and his filmmaking technique in this exclusive one-hour feature. The approach is straightforward but at times is as self-congratulatory as a marketing puff piece. Because Shyamalan works so leanly, the five deleted scenes are excellent, including a chilling scene from the film's final act. Also included are storyboard comparisons and another glimpse of one of Shyamalan's early home movies.Signsis the first of the Vista Series to be a single disc and the extras seem light, but there are only a couple of quibbles: the director again does not provide a commentary track and there is no DTS soundtrack.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004BZIY", "B00064LJVE", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00003CXQA", "B000JLTR8Q", "B004SIP92O", "B00AEFYYH6", "B003102JDC", "B00005JNTI", "B00000G3PA", "B002GHHHKQ", "B003Y5H4SO", "B0002DB54A", "B00008G8M4", "B00AEBBA2W", "B0000648X0", "630471193X", "B002O3Z50G", "B00011CZRE", "B000PHVZNE", "B0087ZG7HK", "B002NZK5SM", "B00004XPPG", "B00005JOC9", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B0021L8UXA", "0783225733", "B0006L0LOS", "B0006SGYL0", "B000NOKFHQ", "B005LAIHXQ", "0800177029", "6305767866", "B00004TS0G", "6304711891", "B00AEFY3MC", "B002GIBVVG", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000U1ZV8K", "B00005JNY3", "B00070FX5U", "B00AEBB8NI", "B0002KVUKM", "B00008G8LY", "B000F6IOAM", "B00005JN0T", "B00AEBBA36", "B002LMV7R0", "B002NZK5UU", "B0013FDM7E", "B002O3Z4WK", "B0068FZ0GK", "B00015YVDG", "B000LC55F2", "B00001ZWUS", "B002GHHHL0", "B000BTJDGC", "B000EHRVOW", "B0087ZG7J8", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00005JN2Z", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEFXSLE", "B00019073K", "B00005LC4D", "B00005JL78", "B00IBKXSKA", "B004EPYZPS", "B00000JDIQ", "B00AEBB9WI", "B000RIWAVW", "0780618548", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00005JN0W", "B00AEFXNLY", "6305428115", "0767811100", "0800141601", "B00AEFXT1S", "0780631536", "B00000IQC4", "B004P7CNUY", "B001GCUO02", "B002AS464Q", "B00003CWS3", "B00006FDCD", "B000FS9FCG", "B00005JKZH", "B000067FP8", "B000K7VHQE", "B00BEIYG98", "B00005JNNT", "B000068NNU", "B000XT1P4S", "B0087ZG7PW", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B002I9Z8BM", "B00AEFXKUI", "B0010X73ZG", "B00003CXIP"], "bought_together": ["B00004BZIY", "B004SIP92O"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004BZIY", "B00386EZUY", "B000QUU4M8", "B0000VCZK2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 11300}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.99, "brand": "Touchstone Video", "asin": "B00005JL3T", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51c02AOAyCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Signs"}
{"description": "WithThe Return of the King, the greatest fantasy epic in film history draws to a grand and glorious conclusion. Director Peter Jackson's awe-inspiring adaptation of the Tolkien classicThe Lord of the Ringscould never fully satisfy those who remain exclusively loyal to Tolkien's expansive literature, but as a showcase for physical and technical craftsmanship it is unsurpassed in pure scale and ambition, setting milestone after cinematic milestone as the brave yet charmingly innocent Hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood) continues his mission to Mordor, where he is destined to destroy the soul-corrupting One Ring of Power in the molten lava of Mount Doom. While the heir to the kingdom of Men, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), endures the massive battle at Minas Tirith with the allegiance of the elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom), dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and the great wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), Frodo and stalwart companion Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) must survive the schizoid deceptions of Gollum, who remains utterly convincing as a hybrid of performance (by Andy Serkis) and subtly nuanced computer animation.Jackson and cowriters Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens have much ground to cover; that they do so with intense pacing and epic sweep is impressive enough, but by investing greater depth and consequence in the actions of fellow Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), they ensure thatReturn of the Kingmaintains the trilogy's emphasis on intimate fellowship. While several major characters appear only briefly, and one (Christopher Lee's evil wizard, Saruman) relegated entirely to the extended version on DVD, Jackson is to be commended for his editorial acumen; like Legolas the archer, his aim as a filmmaker is consistently true, and he remains faithful to Tolkien's overall vision. IfReturnsuffers from too many endings, as some critic suggested, it's only because the epic's conclusion is so loyally inclusive of the actors--most notably Astin--who gave it such strength to begin with. By ending theLOTRtrilogy with noble integrity and faith in the power of imaginative storytelling,The Return of the King, like its predecessors, will stand as an adventure for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B002ZG980U", "B002PMV9FG", "B008UZA8FY", "B001NGML48", "B00005JM5E", "B001GZ6QC4", "B005COPWZW", "B008M4C1EO", "B00HFFE8HE", "039548930X", "B000W7F5SS", "B000I0RQVI", "B002VWNIDG", "B000E6EK2Y", "B001BYMX4A", "B004M1A21K", "B007K3JFUQ", "B001DHXT20", "B001UV4XHY", "0345325818", "B003Y5H54W", "B00005JNJV", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000A3XY5A", "B004LWZWGA", "B000U7WV1Y", "B005LXQLRW", "B001OQCV6A", "B000E8M0VA", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000EHRVMY", "0618640150", "B003ZK99NQ", "B0013FDM7E", "B00005JPH2", "B000UNYK4E", "B009JBWOU0", "B00003CX5P", "B00008G8M5", "B00GKOJ98E", "B004LWZW42", "B000H30B2C", "B000P0J0C4", "B00CZDLGDU", "B000M341QE", "B00008G8M4", "B000FKO5QK", "B00HWWUQYY", "B007SPPANM", "B008JFUO72", "B001DJLD1M", "0345538374", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00005JKCH", "B004SIP9U6", "B000YGGNMO", "B00E5I2M9K", "0618126988", "B005OCFGTO", "B00E8S2JZ4", "6305313687", "B004AKCME8", "B0002KVUKM", "B000AARKOO", "B0006GAO5Y", "B000K7VHQ4", "B002ZG997C", "B00AHTYI5M", "B008JFUS0U", "B0042MEQVG", "B00275EGWY", "B00E9PMML2", "B008UZDXEW", "B004SIP7F8", "B00116GEJS", "B00003CXI1", "B003ZKBELG", "B003Y5H5EW", "B000V4UFZK", "B0007PLLBU", "B001DTPZNY", "B002O3Z50Q", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000LP6KNU", "B005G4TJUC", "B00AW0KHTM", "B002ZG97YM", "054792819X", "B00AEFXZJE", "B0000YEEGM", "B002IPFWTE", "B001ECQ75A", "B000065U1N", "B0051MKNV8", "B000W796OM", "B00J49R1BY"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HFFE8HE", "B00003CWT6", "B00005JKZV", "B00BEZTMFY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1589}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JKZY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HS7iSFv5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)"}
{"description": "Clothes make the superspy in this high-energy action comedy. Jimmy Tong (Jackie Chan) is a well-meaning but clumsy New York City cab driver who is tapped by Steena (Debi Mazar), associate to multi-millionaire Clark Devlin (Jason Isaacs), for a new job as Devlin's personal limo driver. After a mysterious accident lands Devlin in the hospital, Tong learns that his new boss has a secret - when he's not wheeling and dealing in high finance, Devlin is also a secret agent for the CSA, a top-level security agency. The secret to Devlin's success as a spy is his trademark tuxedo, a suit which is loaded with special gadgets which turns him into a high-tech fighting machine. After Tong dons the tuxedo and is transformed into a martial arts master, he takes over for Devlin and discovers that the agent's injuries didn't happen by accident. As Tong tries to chase down a handful of international super-villains bent on world conquest, he has to deal with Devlin's new partner, Del Blaine (Jennifer Love Hewitt), a CSA rookie who is just as baffled by her new assignment as Tong. The Tuxedo marked the feature-film debut for director Kevin Donovan, who had previously won international acclaim for his work in television commercials.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000SX9N2", "B002ZG99M2", "B0002S64TQ", "B005CFBZFW", "B000Y11BC6", "0767819640", "0780619331", "B000006A17", "B000I2KOB0", "B00HVFA37C", "0767851161", "B006LOC01G", "B001BEK8HO", "B00005JLRQ", "B000VUDSH6", "B004U7MR1O", "B000EWBKIK", "B0051SFTGQ", "B000UNYK3U", "B00H4KQMX8", "B00003CXJ1", "078062260X", "B000BXJ1X8", "B00005YUNV", "B004SUDQAY", "B004V2S4V0", "B00003CXWM", "B004H83IOQ", "B0000A9GHD", "B000WGYMTC", "B002ZG99MC", "B002GSXKO2", "B004SUDQ4K", "0780622677", "B004TP55XY", "B005ZMBEXA", "B000EQ45CO", "B000UXOM88", "B004TJWDNA", "B00BNADY8Q", "B000AC7OY8", "B00005JLYW", "B004SUDPZU", "B00003CY5Y", "B00BLN4V46", "B004QDW2DA", "B003JJGBXY", "B00016MSV2", "B001BEK8GA", "B0000U0X1Q", "B002GOAH1A", "B005FQ1OOK", "B000OT6V64", "B000RJO56E", "B002A5EBMQ", "B000085EFK", "B000BVM1QO", "B00AWHDEIQ", "B003Y5HWIQ", "B0000TPA2E", "B0009DWL8W", "B000VSDN2I", "B000Q7ZKWK", "B004CJQVO4", "B00004STRE", "B000O76ZOO", "B00D9EJG5E", "B000NA21SG", "B00000F2MG", "B002GHHHL0", "B00AHQQHFE", "B0002VEUV2", "B000071ZZJ", "B00005V1WW", "B008NP4ZUU", "B000AYEL3I", "B000RBA6C4", "B000803BQC", "B0000A2ZU1", "B004SIP8TS", "0790736411", "B00IXMF2K0", "B00008IHUC", "B0056NEK1G", "B00GDDNFDW", "B000274T94", "B00008WJE4", "B0080QOL0Q", "B000XPU66U", "B000069CF0", "B004U7MR0K", "B001CC7PLM", "B00K7IPGS6", "B00FLCYIAA", "B00441GYY2", "B005KK2FWG", "B009Z4AAK2", "B00005V5NQ", "B00BUC4TJ0"], "bought_together": ["B0000SX9N2", "B002ZG99M2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002ZG99M2", "B0002S64TQ", "B000Y11BC6", "B004H83IOQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 93079}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.74, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JL8Z", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519587FWPGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Tuxedo (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "An enormously entertaining (if somewhat shallow) affair from blockbuster   director Steven Spielberg. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Frank Abagnale,  Jr., a  dazzling young con man who spent four years impersonating an  airline pilot, a  doctor, and a lawyer--all before he turned 21. All the  while he's pursued by a  dedicated FBI agent named Carl Hanratty (Tom  Hanks), whose dogged determination  stays one step behind Abagnale's  spontaneous wits. Both DiCaprio and Hanks turn  in enjoyable  performances and the movie has a bouncy rhythm that keeps it  zipping  along. However, it never gets under the surface of Frank's drive to lose   himself in other identities, other than a simplistic desire to please  his father  (Christopher Walken, excellent as always), nor does it  explore the complex  mechanics of fraud with any depth. By the movie's  end, it feels like one of  Frank's pilot uniforms--appearance without  substance.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00080ZG10", "B006OFN0SE", "B000M341QE", "B00AEBB8NI", "B001EZE5DI", "B004SIP7TE", "B000MZHW40", "0767905385", "B00005JMYC", "B002ZG980U", "B00049QQHI", "B0016Q2D66", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00003CWM3", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000P0J0EW", "B00008DP4C", "B000PHVZNE", "B001N44BVQ", "B00005JOC9", "B004SIP7ZS", "B0007DFJ0G", "B007SPPANM", "B00H9KKGTO", "B002T9H2LA", "0800141806", "B000N6U0E2", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEBB89W", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00001ZWUS", "B0050546MS", "B00DHHWXYY", "0783225733", "6304711891", "B00AEFY0F2", "B002VWNIEA", "B0051MKNV8", "B002ZG99N6", "B0077ATSSQ", "B00011CZRE", "B0013XZ2QK", "B00275EGWY", "B00005JKBC", "B00003CXWV", "B002O5M4T4", "B002FU8IWU", "B008MILL8W", "B004XQO90O", "B004SIP95G", "B000YAF4MA", "B005LAIIJY", "B00005JMJG", "B002QEHPQU", "0780631536", "B00DHDDE32", "B0031OCY2E", "0783240295", "B000P0J0BK", "B004FQX5B6", "B0034G4OUO", "B005HWAOP2", "6305313687", "B003UESJH4", "B000YABYLA", "B00005JKWX", "B00BEIYL6G", "B0058JEHSO", "B000A7DVR2", "B0002ZDVEU", "B00003CXZ1", "B00003CXQ4", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005RYLX", "B001VPCINK", "B000FKO5QK", "B0045HCJRG", "B009POCG0Y", "B00AEBB9SM", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B002DU39GW", "6304806434", "B00JQYV0B4", "B00AEFXE9U", "B00004WG2F", "B000EXZFCQ", "B00005JMCN", "B00006RCNV", "B000K7VHQE", "B00441GYXS", "B00A24CAAW", "B0045HCJ8K", "B004SIP9Z6", "B002NZK5R8", "B000K7VHTQ", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00005JL78", "0783233477", "B000J3OTT6", "B000O77SRC"], "bought_together": ["B00080ZG10", "B000M341QE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004SIP7TE", "B002ZG980U", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00ALTQRPW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7335}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.99, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JLSB", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51bPnAto--L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Catch Me If You Can (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)"}
{"description": "Inspired by creator Michael Crichton's experiences as a medical student in a hospital emergency room,ERquickly became one of the most compelling shows of the 1990s, each episode a whirlwind of intense and involving drama, gritty realism, and offbeat humor.  Heading the staff at the inner-city Chicago hospital is Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards), a doctor so good at providing care to the downtrodden, helpless, or just plain quirky patients that his career blossoms even as his personal life crumbles.  Greene is the soul of the cast, but the heart is Julianna Margulies's nurse Carol Hathaway.  Her character was intended only for the pilot episode, but she ended up capturing viewers with her palpable empathy for patients and her troublesome romance with womanizing pediatrician Doug Ross (George Clooney).  The rest of the central cast consisted of compassionate Susan Lewis (Sherry Stringfield), Peter Benton (Eriq Lasalle), whose prodigious talent nearly matches his ambition, and his fresh-faced student, John Carter (Noah Wyle).  Other key characters included ER heads Morgenstern and Swift (William H. Macy and Michael Ironside, respectively), overachieving student Deb (Ming Na), who returned later in the show's run, attending physician Angela Hicks (CCH Pounder), and physical therapist Jeanie Boulet (Gloria Rueben).The remarkably strong first season showed off its sharp ensemble cast through a variety of compelling story lines both personal (Carter's conflicts with Benton, Lewis's struggles with her no-account sister, Chloe, played by Kathleen Wilhoite) and professional (a holiday blizzard and especially the harrowing tale of a pregnancy gone bad, \"Love's Labor Lost,\" which won five Emmy Awards).  When Carter is pondering whether his future includes the ER, Green jokes, \"It's not bad: Stress, late nights, hard work, no pay--it's hard to beat.\" It's hard to imagine people choosing to work under those conditions, but they do, and in the process these veryhumanpeople perform superhuman feats as they face life and death as part of their daily jobs.DVD features are fairly generous for a TV series box.  There are two commentary tracks on the pilot episode, including one by Crichton, and crew commentaries on \"Sleepless in Chicago\" and \"Love's Labor Lost.\"  A new 39-minute documentary discusses the show's genesis, casting, and the \"Chicago hospital drama smackdown\" withChicago Hopethrough interviews with Crichton, executive producer Steven Spielberg, other crew members, and the principal cast members other than Eriq LaSalle.  Also included are a very watchable featurette on the show's realism (ever wonder why Ross is always looking down?) and another on post-production, a list of characters (including patients by episode, but why no actor credits?), three minor deleted scenes, outtakes, and a glossary of frequently used medical terms.  Particularly notable is that the episodes are shown in anamorphic widescreen.ERwas one of the first network shows broadcast in widescreen, but that was years after these episodes, which are shown in widescreen for the first time.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004STBF2G", "B004STBF5S", "B004STBFPS", "B004STBFI0", "B004STBEXQ", "B000MTEFUK", "B000WMA74A", "B0015XHR5C", "B001FSKE8E", "B001JAHQ0W", "B001JAHQ1G", "B001JAHQ16", "B001L1S1OO", "B001JAHQ1Q", "B000GPPNO2", "B00005JNJ1", "B00GHH9HUE", "B00KWP6JMG", "B001AQT158", "B00188XHFI", "B00005JO9J", "B00005JLF3", "B00D2UMHVA", "B0018CWEXK", "B003F3NE1Q", "B000FIMG5Y", "B001VPJZ0O", "B001QE99AQ", "B0001HAGQK", "B00188XHF8", "B00005JO4F", "B000BX0VU0", "B003F3NDW6", "B002U0KHME", "B000P6YNSO", "B001VPJZ0E", "B003R0MEXQ", "B000BOH8YG", "B000R9YLKY", "B00I4581F4", "B00008972G", "B0018CWEZI", "B009RX7WTI", "B0001906X6", "B00HRUQA6O", "B003FSTN52", "B000FVQLIO", "B003R0MF3A", "B0024FAD8I", "B00KB01OG8", "B003R0MEW2", "B00005JM3A", "B006WK4Y6I", "B00KB01N4G", "B00005JNEQ", "B0001CCXZW", "B001SMC9IU", "B000EWBNMI", "B001B18716", "B003R4ZMPE", "B003LXM1PK", "B000TGURZ8", "B000G6BL7O", "B0000A2ZNL", "B000K7UBX4", "B00008WJEZ", "B001OQCVCE", "B00079FUI6", "B009RX8GSE", "B000Z6GT18", "B002E58FTM", "B003UD7J26", "B003FSTN5C", "B00005JLEX", "B0006IUE16", "B000B8384G", "B007PK8686", "B000B8IA08", "B00B04NIOU", "B000EHSVBE", "B005SEDI5M", "B0007Y08SS", "B00EIXWMII", "B0046S8MRU", "B0055SJXSC", "B00684J49K", "B00A407VBM", "B003L77G10", "B0002NY8GW", "B00166UFSY", "B006WK4Y8Q", "B000F9T70A", "B0001BS3IE", "B0009UC80Q", "B00915G6R6", "B00GLT2TR6", "B00HV0TJM2", "B00CKJJ1G8", "B006CR2OWM", "B00684J49U"], "bought_together": ["B004STBF2G", "B004STBF5S"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004STBF2G", "B004STBFPS", "B004STBF5S", "B004STBEXQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6080}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 18.41, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JLFT", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NGHBMNJSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "ER: Season 1"}
{"description": "With its disturbing images and a few good shocks,The Ringis the kind of frightfest you'll watch to set a chilling mood or spook your susceptible friends, but when you try to sort it out, this well-mounted American remake (of the 1998 Japanese hitRingu, based on Koji Suzuki's popular novel) becomes a batch of incoherent parts. The negligible plot follows a Seattle reporter (Naomi Watts) as she investigates the death of her niece, the victim of a mysterious videotape that, according to urban legend, causes the viewer's death seven days later. (Fear Dot Comborrowed the same idea while avoiding this film's lofty pretensions.) The countdown structure follows the reporter, her son, and her estranged boyfriend into deepening layers of terror--all quite effective until the movie attempts to explain itself. At that you're better off shutting down your brain and letting the creepy visuals take over.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009X763M", "B0006SGYL0", "B004SIP92O", "B00001QGUM", "B00151QYOO", "B001P3SA9Y", "B009XTF8KQ", "B004LWZW24", "B00004BZIY", "B0021L8UFI", "B001JNNDJM", "B000V4UFZK", "B000PMLJMQ", "B0021L8UPS", "B000TJ6PBK", "B0019X3YX2", "B00005RHGK", "B00BEIYMAG", "B0026LQM2Q", "B00005JNJR", "B003UGLCIA", "B000IHY9TS", "B002VWNIDG", "B00AIBZLVY", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00006FDCD", "B008JFUNYG", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00B96TGQS", "B00005JL3T", "B000BTJDGC", "B00AJLHUA8", "B000OVLBGM", "B000RIWAVW", "B003VA3JUO", "B00DW5IM14", "B00005JNY3", "B0021L8UXA", "B00008LUNW", "B000F6IOAM", "B001D2WU9I", "B002JT69IW", "B000AA4JL6", "B00174RCHW", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B00386EZUY", "B0000VCZMK", "B00018D42W", "B0000E2R6P", "B0006SSOHC", "B001U0HBQA", "B00004TS0G", "B003L20IEW", "B008F283VS", "B001DJLD1W", "B0053TWVDC", "B00007G1ZB", "B0015ET3YO", "B00011CZRE", "B004LWZW2O", "B002ZG971U", "B000088NQR", "B002LMSWN2", "B00AEFXSLE", "B0000648X0", "B00005JOWW", "B00005JNNT", "B0031U8OEK", "B006CXIKYC", "B001MVYUR0", "B004SIP9P6", "B003UN0752", "B001NPD9LS", "B008WAM2E2", "B001B1UO6W", "B000GBEWRU", "B00AZTUUQK", "B0002DB54A", "B004SIP9O2", "0780631684", "B003LR5BD0", "B000GCFO0I", "B000VKL6Z2", "B005CFBYW6", "B008G33PIM", "B000GSYRY6", "B0010X73ZG", "B000AM4P9K", "B000A5045Q", "B000056T5E", "B005TK23PQ", "B004BLJQOK", "0783116926", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00BEIYG98", "B005LAIGOQ", "B0097C046W", "B0013FDM7E", "B00BEIYGT8", "B0001FR3IQ"], "bought_together": ["B0009X763M", "B0006SGYL0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004LWZW24", "B000V4UFZK", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00005JNY3"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 99771}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.79, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JLTK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MKWPKHSTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Ring (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Disney changes how they have been delivering their recent theatrical hits and improves the DVD experience. Gone is the creators' commentary track; instead there's a robust 45-minute feature on the making of the film that opens up the audience to older kids interested in the craft. The commentary track is for laughs with the MacKenzie Brothers-influenced moose Rutt & Tuke (SCTValumnus Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas) having a good old time; it's a treat for adults as kids. Also, the traditional still gallery has been replaced by a deft 10-minute display of the various artwork, narrated by the artists.

{"description": "For Baby Boomers, owning a season or two of a fondly remembered TV series on DVD is enough to satisfy any nostalgic yearnings.The Man From U.N.C.L.E., though, warrants the full-series treatment. It's a wild '60s flashback to the Espionage era that was ushered in by Ian Fleming's James Bond adventures. According to a series retrospective that's just one of this cleverly packaged set's prodigious extras, Fleming himself was recruited to create a spy series for American television. His contribution was the name \"Napoleon Solo,\" the moniker of a crime boss inGoldfinger. That movie, which would kick Bond and spy mania into overdrive, had not yet opened when viewers were introduced to Robert Vaughn's Solo and David McCallum's Illya Kuryakin, agents of the United Network Command for Law and Enforcement. This covert agency operated out of Del Floria's Tailor Shop in New York under the command of true Brit Alexander Waverly (Leo J. Carroll, playing much the same character he portrayed inNorth by Northwest).The Man from U.N.C.L.E.offered a bit of hope in Cold War America that an American and Russian could work together to stop a common enemy, THRUSH, a ruthless organization bent on world domination. The intriguing conceit ofThe Man From U.N.C.L.E.was to give audiences an empathetic surrogate who would be plucked from their humdrum lives for whirlwind adventures with Solo and Kuryakin. In the pilot episode, Patricia Crowley guest-stars as a housewife who acts as bait to foil the plans of her former college boyfriend, who is plotting the assassination of a world leader. In a series benchmark, \"The Never-Never Affair,\" a pre-Get SmartBarbara Feldon stars as an U.N.C.L.E. translator who unwittingly becomes involved in actual espionage. Seasons one and two are the series' best, with a stellar roster of guest stars (\"The Project Strigas Affair\" features the first onscreen pairing of William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy), stylish direction by directors who would go on to some renown (Michael Ritchie, Richard Donner), smart scripts, and great action (a movie theatre shoot-out in \"The Never-Never Affair\"). In its third season,The Man From U.N.C.L.E.adoptedBatman's campy and absurdist tone with shark-jumping results While this season has its share of groaners (in one episode, Sollo watusis with a gorilla), several \"Affairs\" stand out. Jack Palance and Janet Leigh as a long cool woman in a white dress are great villains in \"The Concrete Overcoat Affair.\" Harlan Ellison wrote the witty \"The Pieces of Fate Affair,\" in which he takes some sly digs at television and literary critics (a THRUSH operative is a book reviewer). Joan Collins makes like Eliza Doolittle in a dual role as a Bronx stripper and a countess in \"The Galatea Affair.\" The series went back to basics inSeason Four, but by then,The Avengerswas a bigger hit and the writing was on the wall for this once trendsetting series. This lavish box set affair contains upward of ten hours of bonus features, including the unaired series pilot, a series retrospective, an interview with a reunited Vaughn and McCallum, dossiers on each season's guest stars, one of theU.N.C.L.E.feature films edited and expanded from a two-part episode, segments about the great gadgets and cool music,U.N.C.L.E.designs and blueprints, and season-specific booklets.This definitive box set does full justice to a series that had such an impact on popular culture (as witness the bonus Tom & Jerry cartoon, \"The Mouse From H.U.N.G.E.R.\"). More than a blast from the past,The Man From U.N.C.L.E.is still a potent blend of \"cloak and swagger.\"--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001MVWMD4", "B005JJCMNU", "B009DA74CK", "B005JJCMO4", "B005DKS1Z8", "B001CQONOA", "B00E5G03I4", "B005JJCMPI", "B00CPTUNR4", "B00IU6HQ4O", "B001E0O8DA", "B005GYXN2M", "B000KLQUT4", "B001B0H7DG", "B00ESFUED6", "B00962R0H4", "B0014BQR3I", "B00EEEHL9G", "B00CPR3RB0", "B00EC9UHVM", "B001HUHBBS", "B00L1WJK2K", "B000BOH8Z0", "B008MIYKS0", "B000EXDS2A", "0312000529", "B008OIQYXM", "B00E96AY20", "B000FOQ03C", "B00L9K2EGS", "B002L9N4O2", "B00IS6WQ2S", "B00IXPWGIS", "B008X8U83K", "B001DHXT6G", "B000K7VHYG", "B000HT3PF6", "B000GUJZ0U", "B009OE2ODY", "B000FFJ87Q", "B000EQ46HI", "B007ZR9H64", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B0012Z36FI", "B00GX7D5G0", "B00C7A8WWO", "B003NOGNQU", "B000N6UF10", "B000UX6TJI", "B000V3JGIS", "B00KDP31US", "B008NNY89A", "B0050MB5AC", "B00144P9RA", "B000BT96FA", "B00D9EJFQY", "B00KUS5YGC", "B001CDLATY", "B008RJ6TTC", "B002C68WOG", "B001DZOCZU", "B00I099JKA", "B00INMLUVU", "B00HMOWA0A", "B008TMISJ6", "B00D9EJFZA", "B00C10EG7A", "B00KTZALDC", "B003W5C0TY", "B00004Y2QO", "B008H6GHII", "B000HWZ4E8", "B00FUABJMS", "B001R1HEMI", "B00JK47BHM", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B00082ZROO", "B001JFKWE4", "B001MT7ZJC", "B00IXD2MU2", "B00DXLO0BI", "B0087GKHXO", "B00B00HUC0", "B008OR5X6M", "B000FI9OEK", "B001666484", "B00HSJ2CSE", "B003QS0E54", "B009TTGKS4", "B0096W46PS", "B00AML73BG", "B006BZ8NSE", "B0030E5PYO", "B003VJTGNE", "B00FNRA0KA", "B003XMKUEI", "B00BAXTYI0", "B0090EDEQE", "B000A5046K", "B003NKU9XM"], "bought_together": ["B005JJCMNU", "B001MVWMD4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00E5G03I4", "B001CQONOA", "B005JJCMNU", "B001MVWMD4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22598}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 135.28, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005JM5Z", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HwF-jpZtL._SX300_.jpg", "title": "The Man from U.N.C.L.E.: The Complete Series"}

{"description": "A broad science fiction thriller in a classic vein,Equilibriumtakes a respectable stab at aFahrenheit 451-like cautionary fable. The story finds Earth's post-World War III humankind in a state of severe emotional repression: If no one feels anything, no one will be inspired by dark passions to attack their neighbors. Writer-director Kurt Wimmer's monochromatic,Metropolis-influenced cityscape provides an excellent backdrop to the heavy-handed mission of John Preston (Christian Bale), a top cop who busts \"sense offenders\" and crushes sentimental, sensual, and artistic relics from a bygone era. Predictably, Preston becomes intrigued by his victims and that which they die to cherish; he stops taking his mandatory, mood-flattening drug and is even aroused by a doomed prisoner (Emily Watson). Wimmer's wrongheaded martial arts/dueling guns motif is sheer silliness (a battle over a puppy doesn't help), butEquilibriumshould be seen for Bale's moving performance as a man shocked back to human feeling.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006JDVV", "B000LC55F2", "B000FS9FCG", "B0009A40ES", "B000KX0IM2", "B0007Y08QA", "B00AEFYCW8", "0767805712", "B00005JL78", "B0018O4YT0", "B001FB55HQ", "B00003CXZ4", "B00AEFXCLU", "B000FGGE68", "B000WMA6R8", "B002ZG980U", "B003XURDAY", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00005JPAR", "B000GFLKF8", "B00K2CHX9C", "B00AEFXW8I", "B000XR9L50", "B004XQO90O", "B000N6TX1I", "B000FKO5QK", "B004SIP9Z6", "B007WZTMCI", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000093FLA", "B0073U2FB2", "0783225814", "B000K7VHQ4", "B001OQCVI8", "B00011CZRE", "B000P0J0AQ", "B00000JSJC", "B0000AXE8I", "B008JFUQZ2", "B007X4ECMI", "B002ZG97CO", "B00AZMFJYA", "B008JFUO36", "B004P2VQZC", "B0000AC8LR", "B0045HCJT4", "B00J5LXT6M", "B00AEFY5B6", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00177Y9ZC", "B003UESJHO", "B000XA5K48", "B001DJLD1M", "B008JFUN50", "B005LAIHXQ", "B00K7IPFSM", "B0006IIPIK", "B005LAII8A", "B0013PSTMC", "B008JFUNHI", "B001L57ZYM", "B002QEHPQU", "B0034G4ORC", "B004SIP95G", "0767802519", "B001TOD92C", "B008JFUS0U", "B000087F6L", "B0051MKNV8", "B007WXUVHU", "B005LAIH2C", "B000R9U3B0", "B004LWZW7E", "B000MZHW40", "B00005JNJV", "B00005JPD0", "B000GGSMC6", "B0000ACOXL", "B0085A9HU6", "B009YQJ322", "B003Y5H5GK", "B009MO57H6", "B004LWZW4M", "0800195175", "B002QW7ALM", "B00005JMA8", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B001EAWMGA", "B002O3Z4WU", "B000BW7QWW", "B001GUYB08", "B00005V9HH", "B001UV4XWY", "B00A8MGIZG", "B002GSXKNI", "B00IARA8KM", "B004LWZWGA", "B00005JA8B", "B001QTXM5Y"], "bought_together": ["B000LC55F2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007Y08QA", "B006ZL1PGG", "B000LC55F2", "B004P7CMJG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 61424}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.34, "brand": "Dimension", "asin": "B00005JLWN", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K2WVH130L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Equilibrium"}

{"description": "Even though it's only a single disc, the28 Days LaterDVD includes a lot of very interesting features, including the alternate ending that was shown after the end of the film a couple months into its theatrical run.  It's much bleaker, as director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland say in their optional commentary.  Another alternate ending is almost the same as the theatrical ending but slightly less happy.  Most interesting is the \"radical\" alternate ending that takes an entirely different path midway through the film.  It wasn't filmed, however, so Boyle and Garland narrate the action over storyboards, and it's a surprisingly engrossing 11 minutes.  Boyle and Garland also did a commentary track for the film, and they talk about how they were able to get the shots of deserted London and why they used the ending they did.  There are also six very watchable deleted scenes, and Boyle and Garland's comments range from \"great sequence\" to \"a disgrace.\" Slightly less relevant is a 24-minute documentary that spends its first 10 minutes on the real-life threat of infectious diseases before recapping the film and discussing such elements as the use of digital video and the boot camp the actors had to attend. If you need any further proof that the DVD was a labor of love, even the stills galleries have commentaries.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000TJBN80", "B0002ABURA", "B0006A9FKA", "B002WY65VU", "B00111YM5Q", "B0013D8LAE", "B000IHY9TS", "B000Y7U98C", "B00005JO16", "B0021L8UXA", "B0001611DI", "B0013D8LA4", "B000RJO56O", "B002JT69IW", "B001D2WU9I", "B002VWNIDG", "B0002CHK1S", "B00D7AM6M0", "B003UGLCIA", "B00AEFYYH6", "B001MVYUR0", "B000UAE7O0", "B003EYVXYG", "B000EHRVP6", "B0028DRGDQ", "B0021L8UPS", "B001NPD9LS", "B005LAIIMG", "B000FAOC2W", "B000LP6KNU", "B0006SSOHC", "B000WC3864", "B0013FDM7E", "B00000K3TO", "B000RIWAVW", "B000GCFO0I", "B000O76ZQC", "B004LWZW24", "B000RJO578", "B002VKB0KG", "B006ISJR7U", "B00004TS0G", "B004SIP9MY", "B002VKE1K2", "B00G5GNYY2", "B000N6TX1I", "B0024FADD8", "B005QUQRBU", "B001MYIXAC", "B00D3DJIG8", "B001GUYB08", "B000TGJ80S", "B000V4UFZK", "B004SIP92O", "B00009MGEM", "B0010X73ZG", "B00005K3NR", "B002LMSWN2", "B000063RQQ", "B00000ILDD", "B004BZ5AN2", "0767802519", "B00001QGUM", "B00AJLHUA8", "B002SJIO4A", "B00005JMUA", "B00J5LXT6M", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B000AXWHSA", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00005JLWN", "B004BLJQOK", "B0015ET3YO", "B008220BLG", "B000031WD9", "B000069HZP", "B000EQ5SRK", "B0007Y08QA", "B000PMLJMQ", "B000BUNZY2", "B002ZG98UA", "B000V4UH08", "B001JNNDJM", "B003HKN52U", "B003UAKEBW", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0019X3YX2", "B00CE00ZV8", "B00003CXCF", "B0009WFEDC", "B000FS9FE4", "B00005JNJV", "B00011CZRE", "B002T9H2LA", "B000RW5BZ0", "B00005JMXX", "B000WC389G", "B007STBUHI", "B002ZG983M"], "bought_together": ["B000TJBN80", "B002WY65VU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008SAPC20", "B003J42JLC", "B000Y7U98C", "B0002ABURA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 37382}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.25, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00005JMA8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511KHM89SFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "28 Days Later (Widescreen Special Edition)"}

{"description": "Opposites are forced to attract inAlong Came Polly, a dose of featherweight fluff that could've been better and could've been worse--surely no pairing of Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston can be a complete waste of time, right? Faint praise indeed, but fans of these mainstream funny-folk will enjoy this movie as a lazy-weekend distraction. Ben's a newlywed insurance risk-assessment analyst whose wife (Debra Messing, in a throwaway role) betrays him on their honeymoon. His uptight, play-it-safe lifestyle (which includes acute aversion to germs and irritable bowel syndrome) makes him seemingly incompatible with the spontaneous, free-spirited Polly (Aniston), but writer-director John Hamburg (whose writing credits include the previous Stiller hitsMeet the ParentsandZoolander) is determined to give them at least theappearanceof romantic potential. No such luck.

{"description": "In the DVD world, the Criterion Collection label generally indicates that you'll be getting your money's worth on the extras, andThe Life Aquatic with Steve Zissouis no exception. These two discs contain many features that fans of the film will expect: Seu Jorge performing David Bowie songs (complete versions), many documentary scenes of writer-director Wes Anderson at work, interviews with cast members including Cate Blanchett, Bill Murray, etc. Other extras are a little more confusing. For instance, does Seymour Cassel, who plays Zissou's deceased partner, know what he's doing when he complains to a hairless cigar merchant about having to go faux bald? And what's the deal withMondo Monda? It's a cringingly awkward Italian talk show in which the host (also an actor in the film) interviews the screenwriters, throwing out references so random and esoteric that even smart guys like Anderson and Noah Baumbach are left speechless.

{"description": "More than a few critics hailedSpider-Man 2as \"the best superhero movie ever,\" and there's no compelling reason to argue--thanks to a bigger budget, better special effects, and a dynamic, character-driven plot, it's a notch aboveSpider-Manin terms of emotional depth and rich comic-book sensibility.Ordinary PeopleOscar-winner Alvin Sargent received screenplay credit, and celebrated author and comic-book expert Michael Chabon worked on the story, but it's director Sam Raimi's affinity for the material that bringsSpidey 2to vivid life. When a fusion experiment goes terribly wrong, a brilliant physicist (Alfred Molina) is turned into Spidey's newest nemesis, the deranged, mechanically tentacled \"Doctor Octopus,\" obsessed with completing his experiment and killing Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) in the process. Even more compelling is Peter Parker's urgent dilemma: continue his burdensome, lonely life of crime-fighting as Spider-Man, or pursue love and happiness with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst)? Molina's outstanding as a tragic villain controlled by his own invention, and the action sequences are nothing less than breathtaking, but the real success ofSpider-Man 2is its sense of priorities. With all of Hollywood's biggest and best toys at his disposal, Raimi and his writers stay true to the Marvel mythology, honoringSpider-Mancreators Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, and setting the bar impressively high for the challenge ofSpider-Man 3.--Jeff ShannonDVD Features:The first commentary track is by director Sam Raimi and a self-deprecating Tobey Maguire speaking in tandem, and producer (and Marvel CEO) Avi Arad and coproducer Grant Curtis speaking in tandem. They discuss a number of topics, including Raimi's memory of his excitement over Richard Donner's Superman and how the character of Black Cat had to be dropped from the film. The second commentary is by six members of the Oscar-nominated effects team, and one of their primary focuses is how Doc Ock's arms were achieved by a combination of puppetry and CGI.The centerpiece of the second disc is a massive two-hour documentary that can be viewed all at once or in 12 separate pieces. It covers the development of the story, the visual effects, costumes, stunts, and sound and music. Three shorter featurettes cover Peter Parker's struggle between his personal and hero lives, Doc Ock, and the women in Spider-Man's life, and what's interesting is how they discuss those topics not just in relation to the movies but to the comic books as well. (For example, Betty Brant and Gwen Stacy had a much greater impact in the comics.) There's a scene in which you can toggle among three different camera angles, and a gallery of 17 paintings Alex Ross created for the opening sequence. The sound and picture are spectacular, though only theSuperbit editionhas DTS.--David HoriuchiMore Spiderman on DVDTheSpidermanToy StoreThe First FilmSpider Manon the small screenThe SoundtrackGame Boy AdvanceThe BookMore Superheroes on DVDBatmanBladeThe HulkJimmy NeutronJustice LeagueKim PossibleRobocopSpider-ManSupermanWonder WomanX-MenAlso see our Action & Adventure StoreStills fromSpider-Man 2(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000UR9T8C", "B00005JKCH", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00005JNTU", "B000VI70QS", "B001CDR1FG", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000AYELVA", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000AYELVU", "B008JFUO72", "B0083SBMBM", "B004LWZW42", "B004EPZ07K", "B00005JNJV", "B0002IQMAM", "B00E5I2MEK", "B000OVLBF8", "B00E5I2M9K", "B000HEVZ9E", "B008QZ5PY2", "B000HCO83Q", "B00JPS7HOA", "B001QB9H1U", "B00IGVJGYQ", "B0000959N0", "B0007P0Y7C", "B002GSXKN8", "B008JFUPFI", "B000J10EQU", "B0007V6ITE", "B0090SI56Y", "B001GZ6QC4", "6307397594", "B008JFUS0U", "B000IJ79VQ", "B000VR0570", "B002ZG99B8", "B00005JKWJ", "B004LWZWGA", "B005G4TJUC", "B002IPFWTE", "B00005JM5E", "B005LAIGW8", "0767817478", "B000H30B2C", "B002A5EBLW", "B0006L0LOS", "B000U7WV1Y", "B0000VCZLG", "B000P0J06K", "B002GSXKNI", "B002HWRYJE", "B0004Z33EQ", "B0009A409S", "B001DJLD2G", "B000I0RQVI", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B0007RT9MG", "B001GKJ2E8", "B0000AXE8I", "B007K3JFUQ", "B00004STUL", "B00BEZTMFY", "B000P0J06U", "B000957O82", "1402778007", "B0039N74CW", "B003UESJF6", "B00F4FFO8E", "B001HN697M", "B001OST0LW", "B0060FXDCG", "B0049IHX2C", "B000P0J0A6", "B000CEVC9M", "B000UVKGPI", "B009JBWOU0", "B00005JM5B", "B00I6JOD2S", "B001EDVNNU", "B000O77SRC", "B0000633UA", "B000P6XQ50", "B000E8M0VA", "B00008G8M4", "B000EGDB10", "B007REV4T8", "B00BPA2PEI", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B005OY6LBE", "0780624890", "B002935GMS", "0767803434", "6305428042", "B000O78KW4", "B009HIKAN8"], "bought_together": ["B000UR9T8C", "B00005JKCH"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004LWZWFQ", "B003YAR97K", "B00005JKCH", "B000UR9T8C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9593}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.0, "brand": "Marvel Kids", "asin": "B00005JMQW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51529JJX43L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Spider-Man 2 (Widescreen Special Edition)"}
{"description": "The trend is to convertmovies into stage musicals, butThe Producersgoes a step further: making a feature film of the smash-hitstage musicalthat was adapted from the1968 film. The chief drawing card, of course, is Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprising their roles from the stage. Lane plays Max Bialystock, a legendary Broadway producer who hasn't had a hit show in a long time. Enter nebbish accountant Leo Bloom (Broderick), who tells Bialystock he could actually make more money with a flop than a hit. So the two set out to produce the worst Broadway musical of all time, one guaranteed to close on opening night, with the collaboration of an outrageous cast of characters: Will Ferrell as sieg heil-ing author Franz Liebkind, Uma Thurman as Swedish bombshell Ulla, Gary Beach as director Roger De Bris, and Roger Bart as his assistant, Carmen Ghia, among others.As directed and choreographed by Susan Stroman (who did the same honors on Broadway) and co-written by Mel Brooks,The Producersis laugh-out-loud funny. It's also a relentlessly over-the-top, shamelessly bawdy, stereotype-ridden comedy that may turn off its audience just as much as its centerpiece,Springtime for Hitler, was intended to. But Broadway fans who are used to larger-than-life figures who play to the back row while showering the first row with spit, are likely to forgive and just enjoy the famous granny-walker dance, a supporting cast dotted with Broadway performers (playing a taxi driver is Brad Oscar, who originated the role of Liebkind on Broadway then later played Bialystock), or the mere spectacle of seeing Lane and Broderick memorializing the performances that millions never got a ticket to see. (For maximum laughs, stick around through the closing credits.)--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BMY2LU", "B00005AY6I", "B000BJS4TE", "B00005OCJO", "B00C7A8X4Q", "B004SEUJBE", "B000G6BLYC", "B000E6ESIK", "0786868805", "B0001ZX0O2", "B000E1YVZU", "0792844890", "0792833198", "B001LMAKAG", "B00AEBBAEK", "B000077VR3", "B00007GZRN", "B00001PE59", "B0007TKNII", "B009NYF2GQ", "B0013Z7RUC", "B000G6BLVA", "B002D0L0R2", "B0001Z4OXS", "B002NZK5TG", "B000G6BLWE", "B000G6BLW4", "B000G6BLQU", "B007XTDWKQ", "B00003CX8U", "B0038Z5SOM", "B000BITUNE", "B000E6ESJ4", "B0000AM6IY", "B00008973A", "B000G6BLRE", "B00004W5VC", "B000ATQYVK", "630530209X", "B00GTO6WXU", "6304806418", "B00004XMTJ", "B0060QSGJ0", "B001GKJ2DY", "B002JT69LE", "B001MT7ZEW", "B000I2J6YG", "B000ASDFGI", "0783240287", "B00AMQGCD6", "B005S9EK5Y", "B007LNBS2I", "B0000BWVMQ", "B002D0L0QS", "B000RPCK2E", "B000649YA2", "B00004RFEZ", "B00BX8PG3Y", "B008SBXFUU", "B00AEFYVUQ", "B005NFJAZS", "B0090XLDKY", "B00007J5VN", "B00005UQ8F", "B001PO550A", "B00005JLIU", "B00020X88E", "B00AEFY5TI", "B00DHN8GBC", "B00005JL1P", "B00KRFE9UK", "B00005OCMS", "B002ZG976U", "B00003CXJA", "B004H0M2X2", "B006GHA9QQ", "B000NTM9ZM", "B002N1C1CO", "076781326X", "B00067BBLY", "B000BT970O", "B000BYA4J2", "B00006D295", "B000067IZ3", "B005SFR7YE", "B001MVYUQ6", "B00AATV0WS", "B00DL48BM6", "B000G6BLT2", "B004VJJFDE", "6305161879", "B0000714BP", "B002HK9IDQ", "B001KP2J3K", "B00AEFXDO6", "B00EPH8SBM", "B0000BZK1R", "B00006RZ9Y", "B00005O3VC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BMY2LU", "B000E6ESIK", "0792844890", "B004SEUIWO"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 391998}, "asin": "B00005JO24", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514E4E65KRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Producers"}
{"description": "Along withDesperate Housewives,Lostwas one of the two breakout shows in the fall of 2004. Mixing suspense and action with a sci-fi twist, it began with a thrilling pilot episode in which a jetliner traveling from Australia to Los Angeles crashes, leaving 48 survivors on an unidentified island with no sign of civilization or hope of imminent rescue. That may sound likeGilligan's IslandmeetsSurvivor, butLostkept viewers tuning in every Wednesday night--and spending the rest of the week speculating on Web sites--with some irresistible hooks (not to mention the beautiful women). First, there's a huge ensemble cast of no fewer than 14 regular characters, and each episode fills in some of the back story on one of them. There's a doctor; an Iraqi soldier; a has-been rock star; a fugitive from justice; a self-absorbed young woman and her brother; a lottery winner; a father and son; a Korean couple; a pregnant woman; and others. Second, there's a host of unanswered questions: What is the mysterious beast that lurks in the jungle? Why do polar bears and wild boars live there? Why has a woman been transmitting an SOS message in French from somewhere on the island for the last 16 years? Why do impossible wishes seem to come true? Are they really on a physical island, or somewhere else? What is the significance of the recurring set of numbers? And will Kate ever give up her bad-boy fixation and hook up with Jack?Lostdid have some hiccups during the first season. Some plot threads were left dangling for weeks, and the \"oh, it didn't really happen\" card was played too often. But the strong writing and topnotch cast kept the show a cut above most network TV. The best-known actor at the time of the show's debut was Dominic Monaghan, fresh off his stint as Merry the Hobbit in Peter Jackson'sLord of the Ringsfilms. The rest of the cast is either unknowns or \"where I have I seen that face before\" supporting players, including Matthew Fox and Evangeline Lilly, who are the closest thing to leads. Other standouts include Naveen Andrews, Terry O'Quinn (who's made a nice career out of conspiracy-themed TV shows), Josh Holloway, Jorge Garcia, Yunjin Kim, Maggie Grace, and Emilie de Ravin, but there's really not a weak link in the cast. Co-created by J.J. Abrams (Alias),Lostleft enough unanswered questions after its first season to keep viewers riveted for a second season.--David HoriuchiWhere Have I Seen These Castaways?

The episodes are presented in widescreen format, just as they were broadcast on high-definition channels. (Conventional ABC-TV broadcasts were reduced to 1.33 full-screen format.) Four of the episodes have commentary tracks by the producing team and the actors who were featured on certain episodes (Terry O'Quinn, Dominic Monaghan, and Maggie Grace and Ian Sommerhalder). The last disc has over three hours of bonus material sensibly broken into three categories. \"Departure\" discusses the initial creation of the series, the making of the pilot, and the cast (some characters were created to fit the actors, and Evangeline Lilly's Kate was the hardest to cast).

Finally, \"Lost Revealed\" includes two scenes cut from the season finale, 13 other deleted scenes (not identified by episode, unfortunately), a blooper reel, and the cast and crew's giddy appearance at the Museum of Television & Radio.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FIMG68", "B000P6YNSE", "B0018CWEYY", "B0019LY5IM", "B0036EH3XE", "B000ESSSK2", "B00G4SD75W", "B000QDLSR0", "B0018CWEZ8", "B001AQMBKA", "B000FKO3GW", "B0036EH3X4", "B000TFINY6", "B001B7CNZ6", "B002N5N5MK", "B002JVWRD6", "B0024FAD9C", "0756665949", "B00129W6LE", "B000BNI90Y", "1550227432", "1550228781", "1550227998", "B000YABIQ6", "1550229516", "1550228919", "B000AJJNFE", "B0009VBTP0", "B001AQMBJQ", "B0009A407A", "B000F3UAE8", "B000RO6JY0", "B0026RHR6U", "0615508294", "B001DJLCRC", "B0001O3YLM", "B001QE99AQ", "B003R0MEYA", "B003L77GJM", "B000FIMG5Y", "B00062IDEW", "1463548702", "B0038M2APA", "B0024FAR66", "B004TJ1GY2", "B002AMVED8", "B001MVWRNO", "B000I0QLR8", "B0000Y40PW", "B0024F08RO", "B000NDEXK2", "B001C4CI8U", "B00008YGRU", "B000FFJYC0", "B000N3T0EG", "B000EWBNMI", "B004LROMSO", "B00FFSTPDU", "B001HUWQEA", "B000GETTKM", "B00IWTVDUW", "B0024FAD9W", "B003L77GTC", "B002U0KHME", "B000FVQLIO", "B000W6ZUUC", "B0049P1VHS", "B009LDD4V4", "B0075FF5QM", "B0038M2AOG", "B000FOPPBA", "B001934SNM", "B0055SNHQG", "B00D2ZF24O", "B00079FUI6", "B0053O8A46", "B004YM6JK0", "B00B5ARKC0", "B00DII0MGI", "B00005JO9J", "B002BFBB0A", "B000AJJNI6", "B000Q6GUW0", "B002GOAH1A", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B008H6GHF6", "B003L77G2Y", "B00000FBH2", "B000FIMG4U", "B005S97V82", "B00CWIMVDW", "B000Q6GUKW", "B000P6YNSO", "B001GCUER0", "B001G0MFIS", "B0001HAGQK", "B001VPJYZK", "B001VPJYZ0", "0425188809", "B000BOH986"], "bought_together": ["B000FIMG68", "B000P6YNSE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FIMG68", "B0036EH3XE", "B0018CWEYY", "B000P6YNSE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5709}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 16.5, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JNOG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nb5sJm%2B3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lost - The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "More exciting than The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspiancontinues the movie franchise based on C.S. Lewis' classic fantasy books. The movie picks up where the first left off... sort of. It's been a year since the Pevensie children--Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and Lucy (Georgie Henley)--returned to England from Narnia, and they've just about resigned themselves to living their ordinary lives. But just like that, they're once again transported to a fantastical land, but one with a long-abandoned castle. It turns out that they are in Narnia again--and they themselves lived in that castle, but hundreds of years ago in Narnia time. They've been summoned back to help Prince Caspian (Stardust's Ben Barnes, resembling a young, cultured Keanu Reeves), the rightful heir to the throne who's become the target of his power-hungry uncle, King Mraz (Sergio Castellitto). And he's not the only one threatened: Mraz's people, the Telmarines, have pushed all the Narnians--the talking animals, the centaurs and other beasts, the walking trees--to the brink of extinction. Despite some alpha-male bickering, Peter and Caspian agree to fight Mraz alongside the remaining Narnians, including the dwarf Trumpkin (Peter Dinklage) and the swashbuckling mouse Reepicheep (voiced by Eddie Izzard). (Also appearing is Warwick Davis, who was in Willow and the 1989 BBC Prince Caspian.) But of course they most of all miss the noble lion, Aslan, who would have never let this happen to Narnia if he hadn't disappeared. Prince Caspian is epic, evoking memories of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films. (Some of the battle elements may seem too familiar, but they were in Lewis's book.) And it's appropriate for kids (Reepicheep could have come out of a Shrek movie), though the tone is dark and there is a lot of death, albeit bloodless. After two successful films, Disney and Walden Media's franchise has proved successful enough that many of the characters are scheduled to return in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. --David HoriuchiStills fromThe Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian(Click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004M1A21K", "B000E8M0VA", "B0047H7Q22", "B000LPS4J8", "B000OYCM5I", "B003ZHR6TS", "B00AEBB8KQ", "0061992887", "B00139W3NE", "B001NPD9JA", "B0016Q2D5M", "B00005JM5E", "0060598247", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00HFFE8HE", "B004OBQDFM", "B002ZG99PY", "B000I0RQVI", "B001APZMJS", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00BEZTMFY", "B002ZG9904", "B005COPWZW", "B0011U52E2", "B00J0BTEZM", "B00AEFY9RG", "B008D1RDL2", "B0001HAISG", "B006VRRGNK", "B0013BM63O", "B00AEFYIQ8", "B00JBV4R3U", "B005LAIISA", "B001DHXT20", "B008JFUNTG", "B001HN694K", "B001QB5SS6", "B000AAF1TU", "B000GUJZ00", "B0013FSL3E", "B0012IWO0I", "B002ZG97YM", "B0000959N0", "B004AKCME8", "B000VNMMQG", "B0006GANV4", "B000Q66FB6", "B000HEWEE4", "B003HARV3Y", "B00CWM58WY", "B003L20IJM", "B002IPFWTE", "B00005JKZY", "1416995978", "B00005JG6M", "B000VBJEEG", "B001LPWGBO", "B008JFUO72", "B00128VA76", "B0009NZ2KG", "B00028HBES", "B0000640SC", "B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6", "B00I6JOD2S", "B00JK531ES", "B004EPYZUS", "B001LXIDVS", "B004SIP75S", "B00005JN5E", "B004A8ZWUQ", "B004A8ZWW4", "B006P0FIGU", "B001NE80P4", "B00E5I2M6I", "B003ZHVJGO", "B000VWYJ86", "B002BWP49C", "B00275EHJG", "B00003CXC3", "B002ZG99KO", "B0030IIYYS", "B0006FYOTC", "B00EV1YZ96", "B00005JN4W", "B005LAIIMG", "B008JFUQ16", "B005LAIIPS", "B000BB1MI2", "B0030ZIZRC", "B0000DZ3EN", "B000W746GK", "B000UR9T8C", "B002PMV9FG", "B000BJ7BCK", "B00006ZXSK", "B001KVZ6FW", "B007R6DJP8"], "bought_together": ["B000E8M0VA", "B004M1A21K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004M1A21K", "B000E8M0VA", "B003ZHR6TS", "0061992887"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3310}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.68, "brand": "Walt Disney Video", "asin": "B00005JPH2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/618uTYKkadL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian"}
{"description": "While much was made of the fact thatMarie Antoinetteelicited boos at Cannes, the many favorable reviews attracted less attention. Inspired by Antonia Fraser's biography, Sofia Coppola fashions a portrait that's just as dreamy asThe Virgin Suicides, her first literary adaptation, and the Oscar-winningLost in Translation. Set to a soundtrack of post-punk (a conceit that adds more interest than resonance), the teenaged Marie (Kirsten Dunst, quite good) may be shallow, but she's rarely unsympathetic. The story begins in the late-18th century as the Austrian Archduchess agrees to marry Louis-Auguste (Jason Schwartzman). After bidding adieu to her mother, Maria Theresa (Marianne Faithfull), she travels to France, where King Louis XV (Rip Torn) sets the rules--and the list is endless (Judy Davis' Comtesse de Noailles is the primary enforcer). As for the Dauphin, he's just a boy, really, with more interest in his key collection than their marriage bed. Should Marie produce an heir, it might be enough to sustain her--since life is nothing but an endless shopping spree--but clouds gather on the horizon as an impoverished populace rises up against their extravagant leaders. Coppola merely suggests what happens next, although history paints a darker picture. Filmed in and around the Chateau of Versailles,Marie Antoinetteis a riot of rustling gowns, sparkling jewels, and Manolo Blahnik-designed shoes.

{"description": "First released in France, Luc Besson'sArthur and the Invisiblesis a touching computer animated adventure that makes up in look and in character for what it lacks in narrative originality. As a direct hybrid ofExcaliburandA Bug's Life, Arthurstars a heroic ten year-old, Arthur (Freddie Highmore), who draws a sword from a stone to fight a miniature battle in the garden before finding treasure valuable enough to save his grandfather's farm from purchase by developers. Arthur's grandfather, Archibald, having long ago discovered the miniscule world of Minimoys, garden gnome-like elves that lived in his yard, shrunk himself in order to hunt elusive rubies that were hidden in their evil Mecropolis, headed by Maltazard (David Bowie). Now Arthur must assist the benevolent Minimoy clan, ruled by The King (Robert De Niro) and Princess Selenia (Madonna), in challenging Maltazard for possession of the jewels. Shots taking the viewer down through grass blades into the microscopic, yet gigantic yard world readjust one's sense of size, as do scenes, for example, in which a small, elven Arthur fights mosquitoes with catapulted tomatoes. Meanwhile, live action scenes of Arthur's worried grandmother (Mia Farrow) provide respite from a completely computerized world. Bowie, as he did inLegend, steals the show, bringing to life his Darth Vader-like character who chose evil over good in a past adventure. Corny one-liners sometimes spoil the mood, but overall the film's thematic blend of fantasy and environmentalism, likePrincess Mononoke, will delight children with its positive message.--Trinie Dalton", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B004VMWTIO", "B001U3D88M", "B002C2KB12", "B00AEBB8KQ", "B001PR0Y7Q", "0060596236", "B0002LJTF4", "B001LPWGFA", "B002ZB8PUO", "B0009XT8VU", "B001APZMJS", "B001PR0YEE", "B000ION23A", "B00B93IFS6", "B000F0V0KO", "B00139W3NE", "B002FVPFUC", "B000Q66FB6", "B009P7K1CG", "B00005KAQP", "B004AKCME8", "B00AWHDFLW", "B000BITUVG", "B004B8VCIG", "B000IFRT2O", "B003RHZ6IE", "B000OYCM5I", "B004EPZ048", "B009AMAH3O", "B00CWM58WY", "B001LPWGBO", "B00AEFYXD6", "B00005JLR2", "B001EDVNNU", "B000M343BC", "B000A2WAQK", "B001NPD9JA", "B002ZG972Y", "B00128VA76", "B000ICYDJ4", "B00BJ4CDJW", "B000O58ZHQ", "B003L20IJM", "B002OMIKHC", "B000EQ5UHS", "B00009M9BK", "B00AEFXWXI", "B003J7HO6O", "B000SNUHDO", "B00AEFYIQ8", "B00BWRKVTU", "B00005JPO4", "B0040J1RYA", "B000F1IQNM", "B003A6NZ9Y", "B001GCUO7A", "B000ICYDTE", "B000RMJ4F8", "B000DWMYQ8", "B0007P0Y7C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004VMWTIO", "B001U3D88M", "B00CWM58WY", "B002C2KB12"]}, "price": 11.77, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPK9", "imUrl": "http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-site/icons/no-img-sm._CB192198896_.gif", "title": "Arthur and the Invisibles"}
{"description": "One of the first things a viewer notices aboutCloverfieldis that it doesn't play by ordinary storytelling rules, making this intriguing horror film as much a novelty as an event. Told from the vertiginous point-of-view of a camcorder-wielding group of friends,Cloverfieldbegins like a primetime television soap opera about young Manhattanites coping with changes in their personal lives. Rob (Michael Stahl-David) is leaving New York to take an executive job at a company in Japan. At his goodbye party in a crowded loft, Rob&#x92;s brother Jason (Mike Vogel) hands a camcorder to best friend Hud (T.J. Miller), who proceeds to tape the proceedings over old footage of Rob&#x92;s ex-girlfriend, Beth (Odette Yustman)--images shot during happy times in that now-defunct relationship. Naturally, Beth shows up at the party with a new beau, bumming Rob out completely. Just before one's eyes glaze over from all this heartbreaking stuff (captured by Hud, who's something of a doofus, in laughably shaky camerawork), the unexpected happens: New York is suddenly under attack from a Godzilla-like monster stomping through midtown and destroying everything and everybody in sight. Rob and company hit the streets, but rather than run with other evacuees, they head toward the center of the storm so that Rob can rescue an injured Beth. There are casualties along the way, but the journey into fear is fascinating and immediate if emotionally remote--a consequence of seeing these proceedings through the singular, subjective perspective of a camcorder and of a story that intentionally leaves major questions unanswered: Who or what is this monster? Where did it come from? The lack of a backstory, and spare views of the marauding creature, are clever ways by producer J.J. Abrams and director Matt Reeves to keep an audience focused exclusively on what&#x92;s on the screen.  But it also makesCloverfieldcuriously uninvolving. Ultimately,Cloverfield, with its spectacular effects brilliantly woven into a home-video look, is a celebration of infinite possibilities in this age of accessible, digital media.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B004EPYZQ2", "B00IO9D3ZI", "B00EMMDMKM", "B002SJIO5E", "B0044ZOI32", "B001AR0D4A", "B004BZ5AMS", "B001MVYUQQ", "B003BJO8KU", "B0018AG6X6", "B005LAIGPU", "B00IO8VMB6", "B000PKG8SS", "B003Y5H5GU", "B00BPA2PGG", "B0017U7PT6", "B001YV502C", "B0013FBS20", "B008JFUR10", "B001KZVQJI", "B001CW7ZW6", "B0035WTJFW", "B000Y7U98W", "B003ABZGRI", "B000VDDWEC", "B000VDDWEM", "B002JT69IM", "B00164EAC8", "B002ZG981E", "B00AEFXORM", "B001DZOC3W", "B008SAPC20", "B003Y5H59M", "B00HERVMTK", "B00AVSFIV2", "B0032KNA4I", "B000L212HW", "B001FB55I0", "B0018O4YSQ", "B002ZG997M", "B002ZG9788", "B008G33O0G", "B000VDDWE2", "B00K2CHVSK", "B001GCUO5W", "B005J4TLQG", "B000PC6A3E", "B0027VT9ES", "B001F7MSG6", "B0051T46XM", "B00111YM60", "B001GZ6QEC", "B002HR1W1K", "B004SIPA4G", "B001OQCVII", "B001JNNDBA", "B001GKJ2FC", "B000WQWPKA", "B000OT6V00", "B0021L8UXK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004EPYZQ2", "B00IO8VMB6", "B004LWZW4W", "B005LAIHY0"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPXY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Wm5GO98oL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cloverfield [Theatrical Release]"}

{"description": "The Dark Knightarrives with tremendous hype (best superhero movie ever? posthumous Oscar for Heath Ledger?), and incredibly, it lives up to all of it.  But calling it the best superhero movie ever seems like faint praise, since part of what makes the movie great--in addition to pitch-perfect casting, outstanding writing, and a compelling vision--is that it bypasses the normal fantasy element of the superhero genre and makes it all terrifyingly real.  Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is Gotham City's new district attorney, charged with cleaning up the crime rings that have paralyzed the city. He enters an uneasy alliance with the young police lieutenant, Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), and Batman (Christian Bale), the caped vigilante who seems to trust only Gordon--and whom only Gordon seems to trust. They make progress until a psychotic and deadly new player enters the game: the Joker (Heath Ledger), who offers the crime bosses a solution--kill the Batman. Further complicating matters is that Dent is now dating Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, after Katie Holmes turned down the chance to reprise her role), the longtime love of Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne.In his last completed role before his tragic death, Ledger is fantastic as the Joker, a volcanic, truly frightening force of evil. And he sets the tone of the movie: the world is a dark, dangerous place where there are no easy choices.  Eckhart and Oldman also shine, but as good as Bale is, his character turns out rather bland in comparison (not uncommon for heroes facing more colorful villains). Director-cowriter Christopher Nolan (Memento) follows his critically acclaimedBatman Beginswith an even better sequel that sets itself apart from notable superhero movies likeSpider-Man 2andIron Manbecause of its sheer emotional impact and striking sense of realism--there are no suspension-of-disbelief superpowers here. At 152 minutes, it's a shade too long, and it's much too intense for kids. But for most movie fans--and not just superhero fans--The Dark Knightis a film for the ages.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B000PC6A3E", "B002ZG981E", "B00G4RD4PQ", "B0039208QM", "B001GMALGY", "B00E2Y0YBK", "B00C2IGQBA", "B0039208JE", "B00H14WTLQ", "B0039208CG", "B0085D3I3K", "B0039208C6", "B000M5AJQI", "B00319ECGK", "B001FB55H6", "B00EIG5M5A", "7020070078", "B00E2Y6AUY", "B00D5FMGGS", "B001OQCV6K", "B0013FBS20", "B000Q6GX5Y", "B001GKJ2FC", "B00FPS79F6", "B001992NUQ", "B004JMSIRC", "B001RIY4WE", "B00DYEN6XC", "B008QZ5PY2", "B001F7MSG6", "B00FAHYNWE", "B00J7PRJXU", "B001AQT0Z4", "B001UV4XEW", "B0083SBJXS", "B00AEFY552", "B00C8RD79O", "B007KAJG3K", "B007L4HET8", "B004EPZ07U", "B007L4HFDI", "B00AEFXKOO", "B000PC0U1W", "B00C6B8TB8", "B00HINFI4K", "B003TT2X6I", "B001KZIRM2", "B002ZG99NG", "B00EZ4M68G", "B004SIP90G", "B003ZHR6RK", "B001GCUO16", "B003TT2X6S", "B00JNEWSLS", "B001F3FUK6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B002ZG981E", "B000PC6A3E"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPY0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pGxSkkz4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Dark Knight [Theatrical Release]"}

{"description": "Another of those cut-and-paste comedies from Adam Sandler's production company starring one of Sandler's erstwhileSaturday Night Livecolleagues,The Adventures of Joe Dirtfinds the magnificently caustic David Spade emasculated by a sentimental script and shapeless, haphazard cutting. Spade plays the title character, a white-trash orphan in search of the parents who abandoned him at the Grand Canyon. The humor is supposed to come from Joe's misadventures, his redneck gullibility, and his encounters with such figures as a serial killer, a wacked-out janitor (Christopher Walken), and a lovable gal (Jamie Pressly) who may, unfortunately, turn out to be his sister. But the squishier requirements of the story, requiring the audience to feel deeply for the pain of Spade's caricature, are an irritant and force Spade to veer from the nastier stuff he does so well.

Fans accustomed to the slick appearance of the later episodes will be delighted by the rougher nature of these earlier episodes, when the characters weren't as well defined (Homer isn't quite as dumb as he is in later seasons) and the animation was still evolving. This only adds to the charm of these 13 episodes, which begin with \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire,\" the December 1989 Christmas special in which a down-and-out Simpson family adopt Santa's Little Helper. Throughout the season, familiar faces are introduced, as we catch first glimpses of Smithers, Mr. Burns, the Flanderses, and Patty and Selma. Highlights of the season include \"The Crepes of Wrath,\" in which Bart is sent to France as an exchange student (\"Don't mess up France the way you messed up your room\"); \"Bart the Genius,\" in which Bart ends up in a school for the gifted; and \"Krusty Gets Busted,\" in which Bart's lifelong animosity with Sideshow Bob begins.--Jenny Brown", "related": {"also_bought": ["B007KFZ7UQ", "B007KFZ8AK", "B007KFZ8B4", "B007KFZ8AA", "B000067DNE", "B007KFZ7YM", "B007KFZ7Q0", "B007KFZ7PG", "B007KFZ87S", "B007KFZ88M", "B001GQ3GHG", "B0024FAR52", "B001L1S1PI", "B003KZ27N0", "B005QIOJ3A", "B000WGYMD8", "B000WGYMGK", "B000BQPC42", "B009DW5YJI", "B00F4NPBI4", "B00023P49C", "B0012KSUTA", "B00009N80Z", "B000E6ES9O", "B002R8JE7S", "B000083C6V", "B009DW5X0I", "B008412UKA", "B003KZ27NA", "B005QIOJ6M", "B00L89VL96", "B000NNK4DM", "B00F4NPBAC", "B00008YGRV", "B00005JM3G", "B000B5XOWU", "B00008YGRS", "B00JDFTN60", "B0006Z2L2Y", "B0002PYS60", "B0000CABL2", "0062267752", "B007ZFR67I", "B00023P49M", "B002DKGWSE", "B000HT3P6U", "B0072BNKHA", "B0077ATSSQ", "B001E6HUXO", "B00AIANIPQ", "B001MVWRNE", "B001VFM0ZG", "B00JNB80YU", "B00HX14C7Q", "B000ADWCYY", "B0006Q93CO", "B00008EY6Q", "B008JFUO0Y", "1612185916", "B0000C2IQB", "B006W93ELK", "B005LAIHY0", "B00HN9D22Y", "B00JO5LJG6", "B001FB55HQ", "B001VLBDD0", "B009SQ9Q5M", "B00C7E3E7S", "B001AQO3QA", "B0024FAD9W", "B002N5N5SO", "B000EQHXOG", "B009LDD40U", "B001CK1D44", "B003Y5H5EW", "B0014Z4OMU", "B00I099K4U", "B003L77GDS", "B00JHH1VUU", "0785154620", "B00BUWD7Y8", "B000ELJAEM", "B005LAIIMG", "B002FOQXTQ", "B008MCKL5W", "B00IMIGWD6", "B00DQC2FPM", "B0087ZG7HK", "B00GZ0ML4C", "B00AO686MY", "B001QIVEVE", "B00005JG6M", "B0001I561E", "0385352107", "B00I0VTPWA"], "bought_together": ["B007KFZ7UQ", "B007KFZ8AK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007KFZ7UQ", "B007KFZ8AA", "B007KFZ7YM", "B00F4NPBI4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 70952}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 23.24, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B00005ML6Y", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P2P9TQYCL._SX300_.jpg", "title": "The Simpsons: The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "Fans of the testudinate pace and art-house vibe of writer-director Sally Potter's other works (Orlando,The Tango Lesson) will likely enjoyThe Man Who Cried. Fegele (Christina Ricci) is a Russian Jew separated from her father as a child. Raised as \"Susie\" by an English family, she makes her way to Paris, where although the city's multiculturalism is vibrant, the Nazis are already on the rise and the secret of her origin becomes increasingly dangerous. The cast ofThe Man Who Criedis excellent; Cate Blanchett, Johnny Depp, John Turturro, and Harry Dean Stanton all do fine jobs in what could have easily degenerated into an accentfest. Depp and Ricci do very well with minimal dialogue--both go through the entire movie almost without speaking. The film moves at a leisurely pace and is beautifully shot. Not a film to show to a roomful of action movie fans, but it's well suited to people who like their films a little more European in flavor.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004P7CNC2", "B000F7CECK", "B00000IRE6", "B001I04QCO", "B0000VD04M", "0780621611", "B00006JDU8", "B0009UZG0K", "B000NQRR1Q", "B000FDEV3Y", "B00003CXRG", "B006ISJQ1W", "B001HN69AY", "0780628551", "B001EZE5BU", "B00C888MJ8", "B002QEHPQU", "B00AEBBA72", "B00AEBB9F0", "B000053VAZ", "B001A50716", "B004A8ZWSS", "B0000WN140", "B000N2HDJQ", "B004SIP7PS", "B008QE9XD2", "B004SIP6BI", "B0002234LS", "B003CMGE2Q", "B008R65Y28", "B0009XRZKQ", "B00004XPPB", "B00003CXWV", "B00AEBBAEK", "0783229526", "B0009IOR6Q", "B000096FUD", "B00F84H73Q", "B001HN694K", "B00005J9XR", "B003K2G0TA", "B000B6CO5C", "B0000AC8LI", "B0054QHHHE", "B002MWI7XG", "B0012Q7M02", "1780972482", "B005COPWZW", "0859654702", "B000NA22C6", "B0017UOU30", "B0050ODZ6M", "B000AQ69YU", "B000GETUDI", "B00DMUFYFG", "B000BB1MI2", "B002QEHPR4", "B003H5WF3U", "B003XKNGNM", "B004ZG5F3M", "B000C3L27U", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00J5JSV3A", "079284646X", "B000HC2M0C", "B00004STH1", "B00003CXPV", "B001EDFSIQ", "B007NQNRPO", "B000092T3X", "B00064LJW8", "B003QSG9OE", "B004P7CMQ4", "B000022TSK", "B005KR6NS6", "0780630890", "B002ITSAH6", "B004P29LEU", "B000FBFYTQ", "B006ISJQBM", "B000JSI7B2", "B00IJS2OHM", "1550224700", "B00CBK64YI", "B003IY498Y", "B00HEPC0TS", "B0083H6AQA", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00AEFYXD6", "B004P7CMVE", "B0006IIPM6", "B00DJYJWVW", "B006MOYH0M", "B005JODP4U", "B00005JKTF", "B00005JM5E", "B00005JLD1", "B000N3SU92", "B00CMCCAHK", "B0048LVDGM"], "bought_together": ["B004P7CNC2", "B000F7CECK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00C888MJ8", "B004P7CNC2", "B001HN69AY", "B000F7CECK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15467}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.0, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005R87R", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5135RTRSMCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Man Who Cried"}

{"description": "Warping into syndication in 1987,Star Trek: The Next Generationsuccessfully launched its seven-season \"continuing mission\" of the starshipEnterprise, and this classy DVD boxed set gathers the show's inaugural  season in crisp picture clarity and dazzling 5.1-channel sound. A ratings leader  with a sharp ensemble cast, this revampedTrekhonored series creator  Gene Roddenberry's originalTrekconcept, nurtured by returning veterans  like producer Robert H. Justman and writers D.C. Fontana and David Gerrold.  Several first-season episodes have original-series counterparts, and while the  season was awkwardly inconsistent for all involved (including Roddenberry's heir  apparent, producer Rick Berman), in retrospect the series began on remarkably  solid footing.Patrick Stewart was perfect asEnterpriseCaptain Jean-Luc Picard, while  Marina Sirtis struggled with a wretched hair bun and an ill-defined character,  eventually blessing Counselor Troi with delicate nuance. Denise Crosby made a  strong but underutilized impression as Security Chief Tasha Yar, and left the  series before season's end, allowing writers to develop Klingon Lieutenant Worf  (Michael Dorn) into a fan favorite. Brent Spiner transcended Spock comparisons  with his triumphant portrayal of the android Lieutenant Commander Data; and  while Jonathan Frakes was accepted as First Officer Will Riker, fans ultimately  rejected Wil Wheaton as ensign Wesley Crusher, the teenaged son of the ship's  doctor (Gates McFadden). Still, these 25 episodes laid a firm foundation for  subsequent seasons, and highlights include the Raymond Chandleresque \"holo- novel\" of \"The Big Goodbye,\" Data's backstory in \"Datalore,\" the Klingon rituals  of \"Heart of Glory,\" and a Romulan encounter in \"The Neutral Zone.\" The DVD  supplements (all on the seventh disc) are good enough to make anyone wish for  more: four featurettes recall myriad first-season challenges, filled with  insider perspective and enoughNextGentrivia to satiate all but the most  obsessive Trekkers back on Earth.

{"description": "To the delight ofStar Trekfans everywhere, the stellar second season ofThe Next Generation(1988-89) belonged to Lieutenant Commander  Data. As theEnterprise-D's resident android, Data (in the Emmy-worthy hands of Brent Spiner) would gain legal sentience in the season highlight \"The Measure of a Man,\" and his increasingly \"human\" personality would refine itself in such diverse episodes as \"Elementary, Dear Data\" (Data as Sherlock Holmes), \"The Outrageous Okona\" (a misfire, but worthy from the Data perspective), and \"Pen Pals.\" While Gates McFadden (Dr. Crusher) took a sabbatical of then-unknown duration (gracefully replaced by originalTrekguest star Diana Muldaur as Dr. Pulaski), the remaining bridge crew would match Data's vitality: Riker grew a handsome beard and proved his command potential; Worf became richly nuanced in \"The Icarus Factor,\" and met his match (and mate) in guest Suzie Plakson's fiercely Klingon sexpot K'Ehleyr; Wesley matured admirably, despite continuing fan disapproval; Betazed culture emerged as Troi locked horns with her eccentric mother, Lwaxana (Majel Barrett, in a recurring role); and La Forge made good on his promotion to chief engineer while Chief O'Brien (Colm Meaney) flawlessly rode on Geordi's coattails.In a crucial series development, Guinan (special guest Whoopi Goldberg) revealed a connection to Q in her helpful capacity as Ten-Forward's enigmatic host, while Q himself (John DeLancie) precipitated theEnterprise's first, fateful encounter with the Borg (in the suspenseful \"Q Who?\"). Through it all, Patrick Stewart brilliantly intensified all of Picard's renaissance qualities (especially in the dazzling \"Time Squared\"), exploring the captain's facets with equal measures of curiosity, fascination, amusement, courage, and philosophical insight. Despite its lame finale with the money-saving clip-show \"Shades of Gray,\" season 2 charted a warp-nine course to the even better season 3.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005Y1NF", "B000063V8R", "B000063V8S", "B000063V8T", "B00BHWG0DQ", "B00BHWG0CM", "B0001NBNFW", "B00005JLF5", "B000127LW2", "B0002JP4GE", "B00008972H", "B00008KA5A", "B000228EBS", "B00BHWG1AI", "B00062IDLA", "B0002WZTCA", "B0007TKH66", "B00008KGT0", "B001DHXT3Y", "B00062IDCO", "B0009I7NGW", "B0017VG69U", "B002I9Z8GM", "B00008KA58", "B000VDDDY6", "B000AOEMXC", "B00008KA59", "B00008KA57", "B001DHXT6G", "B000A6CLL0", "B00062RCC6", "B00062IDDS", "B002I9Z8I0", "B000AOEMXM", "B00AZMFJYA", "B002I9Z8EO", "6305181721", "B000BOH98G", "B000HEWEJ4", "B00IWTVDUW", "B000BOH990", "B000BOH986", "B00008GEK4", "B000CNE0T2", "B000CNE0SS", "B00000ILBK", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B000CNE0TC", "B002BAW6FE", "B000EXDS34", "B000T9OP7G", "B00JK47BHM", "B0000AUHOH", "B002I9Z8BM", "B000EXDS3E", "B00GX7D5G0", "B000AJJNFE", "B002HWRYJE", "B000EXDS3Y", "B00005JM3A", "B00B5ARKC0", "B005X4P3DC", "B0011FLGZQ", "B000BNTM46", "B000P5FH44", "B0007UDCX0", "B005DEUEV8", "B001TH16CE", "145164955X", "B000EHSVLE", "B00EIKLBK6", "B00GTZWZH6", "B0002JJBZO", "B00BQK4YDC", "B0002NY81C", "B009LDD4V4", "B000A7PKGW", "B000CSUNLQ", "B000EHSVL4", "B00B5A9FLY", "B000JBWWQK", "B0083TUEHY", "B00A3717C0", "B00402FGE4", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00BD6K54G", "B001CCSI2W", "B0009JE6FC", "B00DB97LRC", "B003Y7JWZ0", "B009LDD1X0", "B00CTSDDVO", "B0053O89IS", "B000BNI90Y", "B000F8O2Q0", "B00BUAEYVK", "B001DMVZJ4", "B000V5IP6K", "B00E3UN44W", "B002N5N4M6"], "bought_together": ["B00005Y1NF", "B000063V8R"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005Y1NF", "B000063V8U", "B001DHXT6G", "B000063V8S"]}, "price": 75.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 35691}, "asin": "B000062XFG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51vAE%2BJ9ZBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek The Next Generation - The Complete Second Season"}

{"description": "Farscape: The Best of Season Onecollects six episodes selected by series creator and executive producer Rockne S. O'Bannon. \"Premiere\" introduces American astronaut John Crichton (Ben Browder), who is flung into an interstellar prison escape on the other side of the universe and must ally himself with the colorful convicts: D'Argo, a hulking warrior with a fleshy Rastafarian mane; Zhaan, a blue-skinned priest of indeterminate age; fugitive Peacekeeper Aeryn; Rygel, a greedy and troll-like exiled king; and Pilot, the giant insect-like nerve center of their living ship, Moya. The title character of \"DNA Mad Scientist\" offers them a way home in exchange for a sample of their DNA... and one of Pilot's arms. In \"A Human Reaction,\" Crichton finally gets back to Earth, but with unfortunate results for the rest of Moya's crew. Leading toward the climax of the show's first season, \"Nerve\" and \"The Hidden Memory\" make for a bold two-parter in which Crichton is reunited with his Peacekeeper Tech girlfriend, Gilina, and emotions are strained as he infiltrates a Peacekeeper base to find a cure for Aeryn's wound. But the story's most important function is to introduce the dreaded Scorpius, who uses his Aurora Chair torture device to extract what he mistakenly believes is vital knowledge from Crichton. Finally, in \"Family Ties,\" the season ends on a tense cliffhanger as Rygel plots with Scorpius, Crais intervenes unexpectedly, Moya's child turns out to be something of a handful, and Crichton and D'Argo must take a desperate gamble.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002GP7ZVO", "B002GP7ZVY", "B002GP7ZW8", "B0006FO9B0", "B001DF681G", "B002BAW6FE", "B006LPHY6G", "B007AFC0W4", "B0010YSD7M", "B000JLTRHW", "B000B8IA2G", "B008R52LA2", "B000PMFRTC", "B001RHGRTS", "B000LC4ZI0", "B002BAW6GI", "B000RW3YYA", "B002CLKP00", "B00061QJSK", "B0017MO11O", "B0017MO10U", "B000F8O2Q0", "B000HEZEY6", "6303961614", "B00243FQFA", "B000AJJNFE", "B002BAW6FY", "B0000AQS0F", "B004HYW84G", "B002BAW6H2", "6302020190", "B004EXWGHY", "B000F8O2PG", "B000F8O2PQ", "B00F3L8P26", "B00F6WXPSQ", "B000F8O2OM", "B0009JE6FM", "B002BAW6GS", "B00402FGE4", "B000BNI90Y", "B003L77GWE", "B0007TKH66", "B006LPHY5C", "B004TJ1H3C", "B000E5N6B6", "B000BCCAEQ", "B000BOH986", "B000F8O2P6", "B002BWP2IK", "B004SMDJ9U", "B000BW7QWW", "B00005JLF5", "B000F8O2OW", "B00129W6LE", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B00022FWEU", "B00007AP31", "B001A7GOCA", "B00AZMFJYA", "B004X60QE2", "B0057FGD3Q", "B00404ME2E", "B002ZCY872", "B002U0KHME", "B00062IDEW", "B005PPMHO2", "B003BV8I7C", "B007XF0XVQ", "B000A6CLL0", "B000BOH98G", "B000AOEMXC", "B000SMNL92", "B000FJH5M2", "B000127LW2", "B001C4CI8U", "B004XM38CS", "B004X60QWO", "B00B5ARKC0", "B003H9LIRK", "B005CFC04W", "B000NTMA1U", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00005JM3A", "B000QUEQ4U", "B000ELL1QC", "B0009UV7FS", "B00BD6K54G", "B00D49YFAA", "B000EHSVKK", "B0009I7NGW", "B0051GOB2G", "B0015A5JVY", "B0032JTUX4", "B00064AFBE", "B001HUWQEA", "B001MT7ZIS", "B000PHX8RA", "B000FFJYBQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00F6WXPSQ", "B00E688AZE", "B0006FO9B0", "B0000AQS0F"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 191574}, "asin": "B000067IVT", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EAH5KV8KL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Farscape - The Best of Season One"}

{"description": "A Hollywood scandal springs to life in Peter Bogdanovich's livelyCat's Meow. In 1924 the immensely powerful publishing magnate William Randolph Hearst held a yacht party that ended with a gunshot. Between Hearst's influence and that of his glitterati guests (including Louella Parsons and Charlie Chaplin), no satisfying account of what happened ever made it to the public.The Cat's Meowreconstructs one of the more whispered-about possible scenarios and has quite a bit of fun doing so. Cast and crew alike skewer 1920s Hollywood decadence and, by extension, today's. Eddie Izzard is a boldly odd casting choice as Chaplin, but he succeeds, refusing to fall back on Little Tramp mannerisms. There are several other good performances, but best of all is the cool-as-sherbet Joanna Lumley as the deliciously jaded Elinor Glyn.

{"description": "It's easy to get hooked byClaudine, a lean, funny, Nixon-era movie about a romance nearly undone by a patronizing welfare system. Diahann Carroll stars as Claudine, single mother of six children in Harlem and a maid working for under-the-table wages. Forever worried that her white caseworker will discover her meager, outside income (thus eliminating meager government benefits), Claudine further complicates her domestic situation by falling in love with Roop (James Earl Jones). An affable Romeo and absent but financially supportive father of several kids, Roop by his presence jeopardizes Claudine's official status as a mom without means. The couple's decision to go forward results in welfare backlash, personal humiliation, family strain, and corrosive behavior. A sharp script layers the personal story within a socially conscious treatment, while Jones and Carroll's special chemistry turns the characters into fully rounded people. John Berry (From This Day Forward), an interesting if forgotten director, brings a clipped vitality to this urban affair.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002CWKU36", "B000JLTRH2", "B000B5XOSY", "B0018OAPCA", "B0009S4IGA", "B00008CMRM", "B00003L9CG", "B0000TWMQ6", "B000BUE5FA", "B00441GZ1Y", "0783230524", "B0068FZ0W4", "B00465I192", "B00005RIIY", "B0006IIOHC", "B001JV5BF8", "B00003L9CK", "B0000W5J4A", "B003BV8I3Q", "B00465I1CE", "B000Y11B8K", "B000053VBD", "B004FK5EDY", "B000BNTMAA", "B000035P59", "B0000TWMRU", "B001E1HCRI", "B0000WN0NW", "6305428336", "B00066FAOE", "B00005RDAN", "B0000V499C", "B004MFFB2G", "B000BOH922", "B000667HHW", "B0000VD0MY", "B0000560W6", "B0000714BT", "B000P0J092", "B002RSEN4M", "B000EOTVBQ", "B000TLOMPE", "B00004Y2R1", "B0018B6V9O", "B000BNTM9G", "B008Y1YJN6", "B0000DZ3G2", "B003NH42HE", "B00CDWQNZ4", "B0002JUX42", "B002CWKU18", "B0058KGHX6", "6305308799", "B000XJD34I", "B00005JD5H", "B00CDZBSBK", "B00125WAWS", "B00005AWQV", "B00003L9C1", "B000YAF4Q6"], "bought_together": ["B000B5XOSY", "B000JLTRH2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000JLTRH2", "B0009S4IGA", "B0018OAPCA", "B002CWKU36"]}, "price": 6.62, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7539}, "asin": "B00007AJG2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41N904WFPQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Claudine"}

{"description": "A grainy, enigmatic videotape has the power to kill people seven days after they watch it. This brilliant premise fueled the 2002 Hollywood hitThe Ring, but before that it conquered Japan inRingu, Hideo Nakata's quietly unsettling study in terror. Fans of the U.S. version will find a less elaborate storyline and more primal fear in the original; the basic plot, however, still has a worried reporter (Nanako Matsushima) tracking down the meaning of the video--and, having watched it herself, she has only a week to work. The film's calm, economical style actually adds to the creeping sense of dread throughout, and the hair-curling set-pieces stand out in contrast. Like an old photograph of something evil,Ringuhas the strange-but-familiar power to unnerve. Guaranteed, its effect will linger for at least seven days.

{"description": "The third and final season of Seth MacFarlane's late, lamentedFamily Guyfinds television's most dysfunctional cartoon family even more animated than usual. As MacFarlane notes in a bonus segment about the controversial series' censorship battles, he was inspired to go for broke, thinking that the series, already juggled like a hot potato in the schedule (at one point, it aired opposite the mightyFriends), had been cancelled. Just asSpinal Tapwalked the fine line between \"clever and stupid,\" so didFamily Guygleefully mock the line between \"edgy and offensive.\" Case in point is this set's holy grail: \"When You Wish Upon a Weinstein,\" not aired during the series' original run, in which clueless Rhode Island patriarch Peter Griffin is convinced that if his lumpen son is to be rich and successful, he must become Jewish.LikeThe Simpsons,Family Guylends itself to multiple viewings to catch each densely packed episode's way-inside \"one-percenter\" gags (so-called by the creators because that is the percent of the audience who will get them), scattershot pop-culture references, surreal leaps, and gratuitous pot shots at everyone from, predictably, Oprah, Kevin Costner, and Bill Cosby to, unpredictably, Rita Rudner. Also like their Springfield counterparts, this series benefits from a great ensemble voice cast, with surprising contributions from a no-less-stellar roster of guest stars. Yes, that's actually Kelly Ripa as her \"real\" self, a heart-devouring alien in \"Family Guy Viewer Mail #1,\" and June Foray popping in as Rocky the Flying Squirrel in \"Brian Does Hollywood.\"Family Guy's stock has recently risen with its addition to Cartoon Network's \"Adult Swim\" lineup, a much better fit than prime time. To see Peter invite Charles Manson to a party for Sharon Tate (\"but only if you don't embarrass me\") is to marvel how much of this ever got on the air. Happily, it is on DVD.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000083C6V", "B000AQ68Z0", "B000HT3P6U", "B000RO6JZO", "B0012018OE", "B001VFM0ZG", "B003DZX46G", "B003L77G9W", "B0058YPMHO", "B00E0FW054", "B000A3DFV8", "B003V3FVQ6", "B00FR81Z40", "B000E6ES9O", "B000NNK4DM", "B002HQK5O6", "B0006B41GM", "B0040JHX0W", "B0012KSUTA", "B001RIZ7OI", "B001N9VW5Y", "B0053O8A32", "B003L77G7Y", "B003X4KHRG", "B002JVWQYG", "B003CN5B7E", "B000YOX3HE", "B00023P49C", "B002LARYTW", "B0000CABL2", "B00BYNL8DU", "B008412UQ4", "B00023P49M", "B00LFW6BA0", "B00008YGRS", "B0058RN7KA", "B008412UKA", "B0001ZWLVU", "B00LBHOCHS", "B0044E9JTG", "B000CNESM6", "B000FSME2Y", "B007KFZ85K", "B007ZFR67I", "B004696M94", "B0044E9JSW", "B0024FAR52", "B007KFZ7UQ", "B000KLQUMQ", "B007KFZ7YM", "B000ADWCYY", "B004MLEYTG", "B007KFZ88M", "B0018RKEQE", "B009SQ9Q5M", "B007KFZ7Q0", "B007KFZ87S", "B002LASCJ8", "B001L1S1PS", "B001O0TWXG", "B0018O5WUU", "B008AITJ7O", "B005QIOJUI", "B000E0OE3K", "B007KFZ7PG", "B000UZDO62", "B0006Z2L2Y", "B001L1S1PI", "B00158K0V0", "B007KFZ8B4", "B00BI5YEWG", "B007KFZ8AK", "B007KFZ8AA", "B008OTH56Q", "B000RW3VDE", "B0019CSXAM", "B006W93ELK", "B0000AQS81", "B000R7I3XC", "B0002WZRSG", "B0024FAR6Q", "B008L0YMZA", "B00005JM3G", "B000067DNE", "B000B5XOWU", "B002N5N5NE", "B00HDU9UOW", "B003KZ27N0", "B00GJPUXKC", "B000W91RUG", "B001GQ3GHG", "B0060OKO2O", "B0030Y11UG", "B0001MZ7KA", "B004XVMCH6", "B0087MN9UG", "B000HT3P7E", "B0064ESJ18", "B003L77G6U", "B000AJJNI6"], "bought_together": ["B000083C6V", "B000AQ68Z0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000083C6V", "B000HT3P6U", "B000AQ68Z0", "B003L77G9W"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18968}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 11.97, "brand": "20TH CENTURY FOX HOME ENTMNT", "asin": "B00008YGRV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5154SZ9QMDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Family Guy, Vol. 2: Season 3"}

Before long he's  boozing, dancing, and getting into fights, all of which gives him a rakish  reputation--much to the consternation of his wife (Billie Burke, best  known as Glinda the Good Witch inThe Wizard of Oz). The sequel  replaces Grant and Bennett with Joan Blondell, who can't quite compare,  but she's charming in her own way.Topper Returnsis a rambunctious  murder mystery with some gorgeous sets and elegant cinematography--the  sequence of Blondell's death and ghostly rise is dazzling.--Bret  Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00CF3MOSQ", "B000E0ODKY", "B0044M2OMM", "B0044LYRL4", "B000059ZTM", "B0045HCJHG", "B0000549B0", "B004GJYR7I", "B000HA4WS4", "B001BSBBDK", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B00DZP1BVO", "B000083C6R", "B0090XK9FO", "B008D1Q1VU", "B00C3ALLFS", "0767821556", "B00005R87L", "B00347AIMG", "B0000C8AU6", "B002BZX0JK", "B000KX0IOU", "B000A8AX6I", "B0045HCJQW", "B0000DD77V", "B000KIX8VK", "B00000JRW5", "B00E3HUVWI", "B000ION7AI", "B003MJZ07E", "B0009HLD3C", "B000TGKWPS", "B00CZ7AL32", "B0001WTWS8", "B002EAYDWK", "B000083C8K", "B0000DD77W", "B001D8W7EK", "B0001WTWVU", "B000CEV3L4", "B0045HCJ9E", "B00008MTYC", "B001KXZGNW", "B00AATV046", "B005F265CU", "B000085EFE", "B000CC1TNI", "B00B4NLCEU", "B0001WTWRY", "B002C4N9BE", "B0024FAG1C", "B00AEBB97S", "B001GUYAZY", "B004K4FUT8", "B00AEBB9YQ", "B0012GVMIA", "B0024FAG1M", "B00A1AU6ZI", "B0001JXP2A", "B002GSXKQA", "B000054OT4", "B004193UCQ", "B00IF0KAYS", "B002EAYE7Y", "B0009X75WE", "B0012GVMI0", "B00005UMF5", "B0012GVMIK", "B0090XPGUM", "B0058K5SD6", "B00DZP1C9K", "B0006H32DY", "B000067IVZ", "B002EAYDTS", "B001GLX6US", "B00049QQJQ", "B0047BXR1C", "B0000DD780", "B000JJSJPK", "B00871C09S", "B000E6ESWG", "B000FZETR0", "B005DDN51A", "B001GLX6UI", "B000EU1Q1S", "B0009S4IJW", "B0002XNT08", "B0008ENIDO", "B00003L9CI", "B000BYA4H4", "B00007GZR1", "B0001OGW0W", "B00FEFOK4I", "B00011D1OU", "B000SUHOEW", "B00406UJZG", "B00009IB1F", "B00000C0QO", "B003ZW9H68", "B002945DUM"], "bought_together": ["B00CF3MOSQ", "B000E0ODKY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001BSBBDK", "B000E0ODKY", "B004GJYR7I", "B0045HCJHG"]}, "price": 9.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 11164}, "asin": "B00008ZZ7B", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VSVyS5tpL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Topper / Topper Returns ( Double Feature) (1941)"}
{"description": "\"Matters of Honor\" launchedBabylon 5's third season with the introduction of theWhite Star, a spacecraft added to enable more of the action to take place away from the station. Also introduced was Marcus Cole (Jason Carter)--in another nod toThe Lord of the Rings, a Ranger not so far removed from Tolkien's Strider. In \"Voices of Authority\" the show finds an epic scale as Ivanova seeks the mysterious \"First Ones\" for allies against the Shadows, and evidence is discovered pointing to the truth behind President Santiago's assassination. A third of the way through the season \"Messages from Earth,\" \"Point of No Return,\" and \"Severed Dreams\" prove pivotal, changing the nature of the story in a way previously unimaginable on network TV. Earth slides into dictatorship, the fascistic Nightwatch takes control of off-world security, and Sheridan take decisive action by declaring Babylon 5 independent.\"Interludes and Examinations\" presented the death of a major supporting character, while the two-part \"War Without End\" reached apocalyptic dimensions in a complex tale resolving the destiny of Sinclair and the fate ofBabylon 4(dovetailing elegantly with the events of thefirst season's \"Babylon Squared\"), resolving a 1,000-year-old paradox and presenting a vision of a very dark future for Sheridan and Delenn. All this was trumped by the monumental \"Z'ha'dum.\" In the preceding \"Shadow Dancing\" Anna Sheridan (Melissa Gilbert, Bruce Boxleitner's real-life wife) returned from the dead, no longer entirely human. In the mythologically resonant climax Anna invited Sheridan back to the Shadow homeworld with no hope of survival. Just as inThe Lord of the RingsGandalf fell into the abyss at Khazad-Dum, so Sheridan took a comparable leap into the unknown on an alien world.--Gary S.

As you might expect from \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" director James Foley, this pulpy concoction is more interested in giving good actors a lot of hip, salty dialogue as they scheme their way to the royal scam. It's a poor man's \"Ocean's Eleven\", just as enjoyable in its own way, beginning when con artist Jake (Edward Burns) discovers he's accidentally stolen from an eccentric crime boss (Dustin Hoffman, oozing threat in a fine character turn). Promising to make amends by pulling the biggest con of his career, Jake adds a feisty pickpocket (Rachel Weisz) to his crew, which includes scene-stealer Paul Giammatti and Andy Garcia as a disheveled FBI agent (or is he?). With a cast like this you can't go wrong, but \"Confidence\" cons itself into thinking it's original, while Burns's abundant voice-overs state the obvious and plot twists unfold with minimal surprise.

{"description": "Harrison Ford lends his solid, perpetually disgruntled presence toHollywood Homicide, an action comedy in which he's paired with the squinty eyes and peaches-and-cream complexion of Josh Hartnett (Black Hawk Down,O). Radical French filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard would appreciate this complete deconstruction of the buddy-cop flick genre; basic cinematic elements (mismatched partners, a hard-ass superior riding them, arguments about who's going to drive, arguments about intuition vs. diligent detective work, the bad cop who killed Hartnett's father, etc.) have been scrambled and slapped together with no concern for coherence, making clear their innately artificial nature. Sex scenes and car chases come out of nowhere and disappear without consequence, providing arbitrary visual stimulus. During shootouts, it's impossible to tell who got killed or why, underscoring a basic doubt about the purpose of making movies likeHollywood Homicide. It's rare for a mainstream movie to be so daringly (if perhaps accidentally) avant-garde.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000F8DV1M", "B001DJLD08", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B001UDS4BS", "B00AEFYENK", "6305213283", "B00AEBB9UK", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00441GYZQ", "B00096S4DK", "B00005LB88", "6305133476", "0792844017", "0767803434", "B00AEFYW64", "B002ZG98FU", "B000K2UVZM", "B0045HCJ8K", "B0045HCJFS", "B000FKO5QK", "0767821513", "B00067BBMS", "B00AEBB9NM", "B002ZG97J2", "B00008EYA5", "B00005JLX2", "B000085EF5", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00008EY9G", "B004SEUJ9Q", "B004P7CN7W", "B000BYA4J2", "B0015OKWL2", "B004EPYZSK", "B002AT8K9W", "B0007IO6NM", "0767802578", "B001NY4WYC", "6304698747", "0790732149", "B00008K76V", "B00009MEKO", "B00005UQ9T", "B004EPYZT4", "0767818024", "B003LR5BD0", "B003A12WBQ", "0790731460", "6305263248", "B00004WG2F", "B000P0J06U", "B0087DFIYA", "B00008OE4W", "B000MGBLTQ", "B0034G4ORC", "B0019EXZY4", "6305133468", "B0000AZT79", "B0000B1OFL", "B002ZG96ZC", "B001OST0LW", "B000OYAT3U", "B00005R5GM", "B000LC3ICE", "B00E1HIWXU", "B00260HH2G", "B00BTYOYG2", "B001UV4XGA", "B0000A9GHD", "B003AWRM9W", "B004P7CMVE", "B000EHSVOG", "B00005N5S5", "B000XT1P4S", "B000069DOB", "B001BGS17Q", "B003Q6D2B4", "B001GMAVGE", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B00AEFXT1S", "B001VLBDD0", "B004A8ZWSS", "B000YDMPC4", "0792844874", "B001GKJ2E8", "B00AEBB9UU", "B000JYW5BE", "B000XJD34I", "B008CRB1HY", "B008JFURII", "B002AS464Q", "B0001Z37HM", "B000BFH2C8", "B00008K76W", "B000P0J08S", "0783229364", "B001SN78JO", "B00AEBB95K", "B00BUAEYVK", "B0045HCJ8A"], "bought_together": ["6305213283"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AU740H2", "B001UDS4BS", "B001DJLD08", "B00005LB88"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 45508}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.0, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0000B00KB", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XVMJ3CPGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hollywood Homicide"}

{"description": "In the third season ofAngel, the titular vampire with a soul was forced to stand alone thanks to the (temporary) death of his beloved Buffy and her show's move to a new network, with no crossover between the two allowed. He returns from seeking peace in a demon-haunted monastery to find the L.A. Angel Investigations team fighting supernatural crime in his absence. Fred is still haunted by the nightmare dimension from which they rescued her; Cordelia's visions get ever more painful and debilitating. The schemes of the evil law firm Wolfram and Hart become every more imaginative and dragon lady Lilah Morgan becomes even more of an enemy when lusting after Angel. Unbelievably, Darla, Angel's vampire sire and lover, turns up, pregnant with his child and is tortured by inexplicable motherly feelings as well as a raging thirst for human blood.For a few episodes things go pretty well--but Angel's enemies, both those he has made in his quest for redemption and those he made when he was unadulterated evil, are still out there. Stephanie Romanov comes into her silky own in this series, making Lilah Morgan all the more seductively evil because she is clear about the choices she has made; the satanic law firm of Wolfram and Hart are this show's most inspired creation. As the season moves to its close, Wesley (Alexis Denisof) has hard choices to make. The devastating climax is compulsive viewing, and this season also contains one of the most impressive single episodes of the entire show: in \"Waiting in the Wings,\" writer, director and creator Joss Whedon comes up with a classic ghost story as Angel and his crew go to the ballet and find a performance that is literally timeless.--Roz Kaveney", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000I0QLRS", "B000I0QLR8", "B000I0QLS2", "B000I0QLQY", "B000EHSVMS", "B000EHSVM8", "B000EHSVN2", "B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVLE", "B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVKK", "B0006IUE16", "B0009W5J4Q", "B0024FAR66", "B007H9CNOI", "B000B5XOW0", "B0046XG48O", "B000CCBCGM", "B000OIOPHC", "B000JLTRIG", "B00006J3WH", "B002JVWR4U", "B000ERVJM2", "B001L1S1OY", "B002JVWR4A", "B001992NWO", "B00AMDA2QC", "B000RO6JYK", "B000QDLSR0", "B0053O89IS", "B000GG4Y6O", "B009LDD4V4", "B00133QNSG", "159307784X", "B0000AQS0F", "B000O77SMW", "B001MVWRNE", "B009LDCXNY", "1593078226", "B000HT3P60", "B00JF5GAZA", "B002N5N5MK", "B001B7CNZ6", "B000BOH990", "B000T9OP7G", "B00IWTVDUW", "B000FP2OPY", "B00HUPC5X8", "B003L77G8I", "B006LG74Q0", "B000HD1482", "B00133QNRW", "B000P6YNSE", "B000X5SPBI", "B000F8O2Q0", "B00133QNS6", "B001AQO43M", "B009LDCWWG", "1569717516", "B0024FAD9C", "B000BOH98G", "B000FIMG68", "B000CNE0SS", "B000N6SE4U", "B001MVWRN4", "0671042599", "B001M5UDGS", "B004YM6JI2", "B00008KA57", "B002JVWRAO", "B001MVWRNO", "B0018CWEYY", "B000O77SN6", "B000NOKFGW", "B003L77GH4", "B000R7GKQE", "B0085KGG96", "1613771002", "B0002RQ3MK", "B0001JXPPC", "B004X60QWO", "1593078269", "B00BEJL6JK", "B001QE99AQ", "B003IMERF6", "B000ERVJLS", "B003L77GGK", "B000BOH986", "B000F8O2PG", "B000F8O2OM", "1595826106", "B0092Q82LC", "B00129W6LE", "B000A5045Q", "B000GG4Y28", "B00HWWUQWQ", "1613770596", "B002DLB1H0", "1595829350", "B00HVJKAMG"], "bought_together": ["B000I0QLRS", "B000I0QLR8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000I0QLR8", "B000I0QLQY", "B000I0QLRS", "B000I0QLS2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 36251}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 27.09, "brand": "", "asin": "B0000TEW8C", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41MCS68Z78L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Angel - Season Three"}
{"description": "TheUnderworldDVD has a powerful soundtrack that makes good use of ambient noises (e.g., bullet casings pinging on the floor) and has a clear, well-defined picture, which is especially impressive considering the film's predominant look is black leather at nighttime.  The first segment of the four-part, 54-minute documentary is mostly self-congratulation and plot summary (which is not necessarily a bad thing); more interesting are the creature effects and the actors learning how to do their own stunts.  If you were wondering if the voice of the Lycan Raze was really that deep, you can listen to him--actor/co-writer Kevin Grevioux--along with director Len Wiseman and co-writer Danny McBride on the first commentary track as they discuss breaking the rulebook for vampires and shooting in Budapest on a tiny $22 million budget.  The accent-heavy technical commentary discusses how the visual effects and sound design add to the film--one of their goals was to make Kate Beckinsale look \"sexy, stylish, and subversive.\"--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000F6IOC0", "B001HN697M", "B003Y5H5EW", "B0002KVUKM", "B0002J4X1Q", "0767834739", "B001JV5B12", "B000YPUF9W", "B002ZG98UA", "B009MO57H6", "0780624890", "B001AK3S4Y", "B001GUYB08", "B0007V6ITE", "B001F7MSFM", "B000F6IOBG", "B001GCUO0W", "B000FGGE68", "B005LAIHSG", "B0002YLCG0", "B0009MDPYM", "B000AYELVA", "0800195175", "B000069I1I", "B00005JKWJ", "B008OR5X4O", "B0000AXE8I", "B002GSXKNI", "B00005JKYX", "B004EPZ07K", "B005LAIH2C", "B003Y5H5F6", "B0000DKDUR", "B003HKN52U", "B002KX9CPO", "B005CFBZWK", "B00008AOVL", "B00IKM5LXG", "B001VLFE7Q", "B004LWZW42", "B001VLFE7G", "B0001BKAEY", "B005LAIH54", "B001QOGYFO", "B00005JL78", "B0000844I8", "B001PR0Y8K", "B005G4TJUC", "B002NXSRVG", "B00005JM5E", "B00AEBBA72", "B001L9EXUC", "B0007WFX62", "B0013J55B6", "B002O3Z50Q", "B00000JQB5", "B002ZG977Y", "B00003CXTA", "B000GCFO0I", "B0000959N0", "B00AEFXCLU", "B0001O3YD0", "B001OQCV6A", "B0002ZDVEU", "B002ZG98N2", "B005LAIIPS", "B000IHY9TS", "B00005JM5B", "B004LWZWGA", "B000P0J0AQ", "B0053FANPY", "B00AEFY5B6", "B0085A9HU6", "B000CEV4XQ", "B00005RHGK", "B0000E2R6P", "B0006SSOHC", "B000OVLBHG", "B00AEFYGBA", "B002TMI2A2", "B0002VEUV2", "B009YQJ322", "B000EHRVP6", "B003ZKBELG", "B00005JNJV", "B002DKGWSE", "B000VWYJ86", "B005LAIHYU", "B00003CXSD", "B0015XHP2C", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00AZTUUQK", "B004EPYZT4", "B000TGJ80S", "B00027JZ3E", "B001GKJ2E8", "B001VLBDD0", "0767803434", "B004LWZWFQ", "B00195FUDC"], "bought_together": ["B003Y5H5EW", "B001HN697M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003Y5H5EW", "B007WZTG1U", "B001VLFE7G", "B001HN697M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 128315}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.94, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0000VAFNQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412NSB5PCYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Underworld (Full Screen Special Edition)"}

{"description": "Despite critical barbs as sharp as a Maroobi spear,Gilligan's Islandhas proven unsinkable. Its first season was 1964's top-rated show. The expository theme song is one of television's most quoted, and its characters--the Skipper (Alan Hale Jr.), first mate Gilligan (Bob Denver), the millionaire (Jim Backus) and his wife (Natalie Schaefer), a movie star (Tina Louise), \"and the rest\" (Russell Johnson and Dawn Wells, as the Professor and Mary Ann, wouldn't get their opening credit props until season two)--are pop culture icons. Revisiting the first season's 36 episodes is a not-guilty-at-all pleasure. Some sure and surprising hands piloted these inaugural episodes, including Ida Lupino, Jack Arnold (The Creature from the Black Lagoon), Christian Nyby (The Thing), and Richard Donner (who went on to directSupermanandLethal Weapon).The \"seven stranded castaways\" from the ill-fated S.S.Minnow(slyly named for former Federal Communications Commission head Newton \"vast wasteland\" Minow) received memorable visits from the likes of Hans Conreid as errant pilot Wrong Way Feldman, a young Kurt Russell as Jungle Boy, and Larry Storch as a Cagney-esque bank robber.  But these were mere diversions from the heart of the series; the no-man-is-an-island social microcosm that creator Sherwood Schwartz conceived as an anti-war parable (this courtesy of his optional commentary during the fabled unaired series pilot). In the Christmas episode \"Birds Gotta Fly, Fish Gotta Talk,\" Santa Claus himself drops in to lift the disheartened castaways' spirits. \"You could have been enemies,\" he tells them, \"instead of a family group who all learned to get along.\" This is they key to this series' enduring popularity. That, and the unending debate: Ginger or Mary Ann?--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001MBTSTU", "B0072BNJ0I", "B0006BAWSI", "B00DXLO0D6", "B00DXLO086", "B000MGBSEY", "B001NRPQKI", "B001DZOCZU", "B000NA21YA", "B002L9N4O2", "B00DXLO0BI", "B000V3JGIS", "B001DHXT4I", "B001E0O8DA", "B000291Q3Y", "B000CCBCHQ", "B000BT96OG", "B0006Z2L4W", "B000EQ46HI", "B0009OUBPQ", "B000B5XOUM", "B0009B16TO", "B001E6FMMU", "B001BN4WHW", "B000N6UF10", "B00A2L1CKO", "B000FGX5PG", "B001LM64VK", "B008H6GHII", "B000TGJ8B2", "B00BNAE30O", "B001CT05TE", "B000Z6GT18", "B000HEZEYG", "B00FFARI7I", "B000E33VZ4", "B000A0GORS", "B0000V4906", "B0002JZT5U", "B000FSMEB0", "B0009I7NH6", "B0001DMXEC", "B00000F61N", "B00HW3L9MG", "B005OASMLU", "B00144NHV0", "B00961ENYI", "B006WN5W5M", "B000CCBCCQ", "B000M343B2", "B00A2L1CJK", "B000KLQUSK", "B000M8N412", "B001DMVZJ4", "B00144P9RA", "B0009SCVBY", "B0002NY8PI", "B006UI5ARY", "B00005JNS8", "B000IHYXIK", "B0002I837M", "B000UX6TL6", "B000GH3CDY", "B001666484", "B000M343AS", "B00BWQU0RY", "B000F9T70K", "B00280QNKG", "B000GIXIN2", "B00HVFA36I", "B00GOC74RU", "B00HJQMFF6", "B0001JXP2A", "B001DMVZJO", "B000E3L7FK", "B000E5KQLY", "B00005JOEB", "B0038SUBDC", "B001D5C1F8", "B000HT3P5Q", "B00D2UMHGA", "B001DSNEME", "B00IF0KAYS", "B000291Q3O", "B005SQRYOG", "B000GW8U9U", "B0009W5KJU", "B0077T5SN6", "B000VS6R3A", "B000EZ9084", "B000NOIX7U", "B001CQONOA", "B003W5C0TY", "B000H9HX5E", "B005EVY8NA", "B0009UC7MK", "B00G5N6C8U", "B000C6NPHC", "B000UX6TKM", "B007RMQ56M"], "bought_together": ["B001MBTSTU", "B00DXLO0D6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DXLO086", "B0006BAWSI", "B00DXLO0D6", "B001MBTSTU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 26502}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 15.59, "brand": "TURNER HM ENTERTAINM", "asin": "B0000WN1WW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51msjTKplYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gilligan's Island: Season 1"}

{"description": "ERkicked off its second season of high-intensity drama and wry humor by introducing a character who would turn out to be a long-term member of--and a major irritation for--the inner-city Chicago hospital staff.  After Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards) is promoted to attending physician, the door is open for a new chief resident, and in walks Kerry Weaver (Laura Innes), who wastes no time ruffling everyone's feathers with her strict managerial style and subtle putdowns. One of her prime targets, Susan Lewis (Sherry Stringfield), struggles to balance her personal and professional life when she has to take care of her abandoned infant niece.  The Lewis character grows the most during the season, along with second-year student John Carter (Noah Wylie), whose natural compassion gives way to professional ambition following the model of his teacher, ambitious and self-absorbed Peter Benton (Eriq LaSalle). Benton angles for a position with a renowned cardiovascular surgeon (Ron Rifkin) and has to deal with the fallout from a relationship with physician's assistant Jeannie Boulet (Gloria Reubens), yet he also starts to show some glimmers of humanity.Greene has his own problems trying to manage a long-distance marriage, while nurse Carol Hathaway (Julianna Margulies) bounces back from her aborted first-season marriage attempt to start a new relationship with paramedic Shep (Ron Eldard, who also became Margulies's real-life partner).  She buys her first house and enjoys an entire season out of the companionship of Doug Ross (George Clooney), who as always runs into problems with his cowboy style and philandering ways.  But just when he's finally driven himself out of the ER, he has to go play hero when he finds a boy pinned in a storm drain in an episode that was nominated for six Emmys and remains one of the, excuse the pun, high-water marks of the series. That and such episodes as \"The Healers,\" which deals with the aftermath of Shep's daring fire rescue, prove that whenERwas at its best, it was as good as anything on television.Guest appearances include Lucy Liu as the mother of an AIDS-stricken boy, Red Buttons as an elderly husband, Joanna Gleason as an infomercial producer, and Jake Lloyd (Star Wars: Episode I, The Phantom Menace) as the son of a prostitute. DVD bonus features are a little lighter than on the first-season set, consisting of a commentary track (by co-executive producer Mimi Leder, editor Randy Jon Morgan, and Laura Innes) on the season's first episode and \"The Healers,\" a nine-minute spotlight on \"Hell and High Water,\" an 11-minute piece on the series' multiple directors, 14 minutes of outtakes, and a gag reel.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004STBF5S", "B00005JLFT", "B004STBFPS", "B004STBFI0", "B004STBEXQ", "B000MTEFUK", "B000WMA74A", "B0015XHR5C", "B001FSKE8E", "B001JAHQ0W", "B001JAHQ16", "B001JAHQ1G", "B001L1S1OO", "B001JAHQ1Q", "B000GPPNO2", "B00005JNJ1", "B001AQT158", "B003F3NE1Q", "B001VPJZ0E", "B000FIMG5Y", "B001VPJZ0O", "B0018CWEZI", "B0018CWEXK", "B0001CCXZW", "B003LXM1B4", "B003F3NDW6", "B00684J49U", "B000FVQLIO", "B00005JO9J", "B003R0MEW2", "B0012CJQYQ", "B00I4581F4", "B0000A2ZNL", "B001OQCVCE", "B00188XHFI", "B003R0MEXQ", "B000P6YNSO", "B002BJGYTY", "B002E58FTC", "B001QE99AQ", "B000BX0VU0", "B00B04NIOU", "B002BJGYTO", "B00915G6TE", "B0015XWU9K", "B000BB1MIM", "B00124ONG0", "B001A4VH2U", "B0002WZTLQ", "B00D2UMHVA", "B001TKJDIU", "B0006IUE16", "B0001906X6", "B003LXM1PK", "B002BJGYV2", "B0047HXMNE", "B0018CWEVW", "B002BJGYU8", "B000R9YLKY", "B009RX7WTI", "B0012CJQY6", "B007PK8686", "B003FSTN5C", "B00EIXWMII", "B0058YPJ8G", "B0001ZDKXI", "B003R0MEZO", "B0053O89IS", "B000FIMG4U", "B000UX6TIE", "B000QUTTPG", "B0002I838Q", "B00684J49K", "B000068CNX", "B001CQONKY", "B009RX7IX8", "B0013FSL16", "B003CN5SAY", "B001JAHPXK", "B002WN8IR0", "B00GLT2TR6", "B0002I84FS", "B000N6TYLW", "B00HRUQA6O", "B003TNW04Y", "B005PYL8VQ", "B00GHH9HUE", "B0024FAD8I", "B002BAW6HW", "B0001O3YLM", "B001VPJYZU", "B005SEDI5M", "B000CELOV8", "B001PQZYQI", "B000YKYT1M", "B00008972G", "B000QFCDAO", "B000ION72Q", "B0046S8MRU", "B000BOH98G"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLFT", "B004STBF5S"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JLFT", "B004STBF5S", "B000MTEFUK", "B000WMA74A"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 39927}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 21.79, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001AVZNU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510VRD5SQ6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "ER: Season 2"}

While the widescreen artistry is often brutal, it is also breathtaking, especially in a fantastic chase sequence involving train cars.

{"description": "Fear and panic are the keywords of this film. At every opportunity the narration attempts to make the audience feel this, but the sight of a giant bird doesn1t instil panic. The big bird eats airmen. We are told by a scientist something about anti-matter and how it must exist. Then we have to jump the credibility gap to believe that this bird came from an anti-matter universe, and so it has a force-field around it (?!). The physics makes no sense, neither does the logic. The bird attacks all the major cities and so there is world-wide panic. Why? one asks. Well one shouldn't ask. There is world-wide fear. Then martial law is declared around the world. Food and movement is controlled by the military, there is a curfew, and a range of other draconian measures. If people ignore these, they get eaten by the bird.

No-one explains satisfactorily why there would be such panic. Not only panic but 'panic and nightmare terror'.

{"description": "Pay cable's \"other\"show about life and death,Dead Like Metakes a darkly comic look at mortality through the eyes of someone stuck between this life and the afterlife. \"Bail bondsmen for the disembodied\" is how Rube (Mandy Patinkin), the often exasperated Reaper foreman, explains it to disaffected 18-year-old George (Ellen Muth) after she&rsquo;s vaporized by a falling toilet seat from theMirspace station and drafted into the ranks of the Reapers. It's now her job to take the souls of the doomed, preferably before their mortal coil is damaged beyond recognition by the devilish machinations of the gremlin-like gravelings.You wouldn&rsquo;t mistake George's fellow Reapers for the do-gooders ofTouched by an Angel, but they are anything but grim. Charming British shyster Mason (Callum Blue) always has some scam brewing, high-living, fun-loving former flapper Betty (Rebecca Gayheart) treats death as a cabaret (\"Reaping Havoc\"), and one-time starlet and wannabe actress Daisy (Laura Harris) still nurses her dreams of stardom. Even hard-bitten meter maid Roxy (Jasmine Guy) manages to find a way to let loose.Dead Like Meputs a light touch on black comedy, but it has a sneaky way of using humor to explore loss, loneliness, and regret, as well as kindness, and courage, and responsibility. George gets a hard lesson when she tries to wriggle out of her assignments like some overgrown kid, only to see the damage of her (in)action in \"Reapercussions.\" And as George's angry, tightly-wound mother (Cynthia Stevenson) and withdrawn little sister Reggie cope with death, she breaks the rules to watch over them: their own pouty, glum guardian angel. There's nothing like your own death to put your life into perspective.The four-disc set features all 14 episodes of the debut season of Showtime's witty black comedy. The feature-length pilot includes optional commentary by cast members Ellen Muth, Mandy Patinkin, Jasmine Guy, Cynthia Stevenson, and Callum Blue. Other supplements include the nominal documentary featurettesDead Like Me: Behind-the-scenesandThe Music of Dead Like Me(with theme song composer Stewart Copeland), 32 deleted scenes, and a still gallery.--Sean AxmakerStills fromDead Like Me - The Complete First Season(Click for larger image)&nbsp;&nbsp;", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00094ARGY", "B001JV5BHQ", "B0006GAO18", "B00GT4NCK6", "B000YAA2SQ", "B001FB4VZ8", "B001EN5I3Q", "B001WAKNCC", "B005SEDI5M", "B0007TKHKC", "B001A7X0ZO", "B001XW7ICW", "B000EHSVKK", "B00GT2TEPU", "B001FB4VZI", "B000O77SMW", "B008PJZDXW", "B00DNUSFZQ", "B000GG4Y28", "B000QDLSR0", "B000E6EK42", "B0002JP4DW", "B000AO9BSS", "B0018CWEYY", "B000I0QLR8", "B005PPMHO2", "B000U1ZV1W", "B000I0QLQY", "B0019LY5IM", "B0018CWEXA", "B00005JNOG", "B000I0QLRI", "B000GH3CWK", "B004BZ5AHI", "B008H1Q61G", "B004SMDJ9U", "B0001KL5DA", "B0007R4SWM", "B000I0QLRS", "B003L77GWE", "B001ASIHZG", "B0019Z3P84", "B003R0MEYA", "B0009NZ2W4", "B0051GOB2G", "B0002XVKMM", "B00022FWEU", "B000O77SN6", "B001C8W7EQ", "B000FIMG68", "B002AK9UPO", "B00540G3GG", "B004X60QE2", "B000MEYKCS", "B000SMNL92", "B00HUCF7AO", "B001DPHDBU", "B00133QNS6", "B0025KVKDO", "B000NOKFH6", "B0081QF6Q8", "B002GP7ZV4", "B003FSTN7K", "B000T9OP7G", "B000HWZ4MA", "B0002PYS7Y", "B007AFC0W4", "B000FL7CAK", "B00062IDEW", "B001AZIRZ4", "B000ERVJKE", "B000ENUYGI", "B0009IW88K", "B0000AQS0F", "B002N5N5MK", "B000GTLQVW", "B001B7CNZ6", "B0000AUHQE", "B00GOC74QG", "B008B4KVRE", "B009AMAGQM", "B008YRL6LI", "B002BWP2IK", "B004XM38CS", "B000SO7PBU", "B000EOTV98", "B00005JPII", "B0085KGG96", "B000GG4Y5K", "B004QOB8TS", "B000Q6GUW0", "0792159659", "B001DF681G", "B002CAWNEM", "B0037AGB9O", "B002D1XKB0", "B008QE9XD2", "B00A8KJN8M"], "bought_together": ["B001JV5BHQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00GT2TEPU", "B000YAA2SQ", "B0006GAO18", "B001FB4VZ8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 35276}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 49.98, "brand": "MUTH,ELLEN", "asin": "B0001GF2F6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZLwUB8oPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dead Like Me - The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "The first movie produced by Afghanistan filmmakers after the fall of the  Taliban,Osamais a searing portrait of life under the oppressive  fundamentalist regime. Because women are not allowed to work, a widow  disguises her young daughter (Marina Golbahari) as a boy so they won't  starve to death. Simply walking the streets is frightening enough, but  when the disguised girl is rounded up with all the boys in the town for  religious training, her peril becomes absolutely harrowing. Golbahari's  face--beautiful but taut with terror--is riveting. The movie captures both  her plight and the miseries of daily life in spare, vivid images. At one  point, her mother is nearly killed for exposing her feet while riding on  the back of a bicycle; for the entire scene, the camera shows only her  feet, with the spokes of the wheel radiating out behind as she lowers her  burka over them.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0031DDGA4", "B0012OX7EO", "B000089RTN", "B000065V3Z", "B00GMV8B1G", "B0087OULO6", "B000GIXE86", "B002U4F5W2", "B00116VG3M", "B000EHQ7JC", "B00004VVO5", "B002VRNJT4", "B006IW8E3Y", "B002M36R50", "B000A7LR82", "B002T921C0", "B000E0OE44", "B00HXH00ZI", "B001JH7F42", "B000S0GYD4", "B000FC2FX8", "B000B91N3S", "6305835357", "B0016MLIK2", "B008NNY98U", "B00DJYJOPG", "B0007R4T3U", "B00005JLD4", "B00AEFYF9I", "B001BOCCPA", "B00GMV89CM", "B00000F5KH", "B0015OKWKI", "B0031DDG9U", "B003BKZ1OG", "B001BNFR76", "B00078XGP6", "B000SM6FLI", "B00ATK0452", "B000IHYXH6", "B000H5V8H2", "B000AM4P90", "B00005JLR8", "B000WC38IC", "161145025X", "B000N3T0DW", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00GOT1244", "B00006AW0I", "B00080Z53O", "B004Z6N7HS", "B000LAZE8C", "B002PLMJ74", "B00FGVS07S", "B0012QE4PI", "B0009PW3RO", "B000U2U0E4", "B002M2T1V8", "B0002TT0MI", "B00007KQ9V", "B0013B34X0", "B000O76ZQC", "B0013D8LNG", "B0009PW3RE", "B000058AOI", "B0028FGSQK", "B0086900LG", "B0000C2IW7", "B004XVMCMG", "B00005QFE5", "B000AQ6A4E", "B0000A02Y4", "B000TXNDV6", "B000YAA68W", "1596981040", "B005HFI7IU", "B000934FC2", "B0057ZAA0S", "B000UJ48SQ", "B0024EWP6W", "0385526229", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002SF9YNO", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00443FMKM", "B0002ZA1HA", "B0001US61O", "159463193X", "6305999872", "B00003L9CK", "B000A8AXXG", "B00AEFYCW8", "079284646X", "0786464720", "B0000AKCLX", "B001H5ZQHY"], "bought_together": ["B0031DDGA4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0031DDGA4", "B000089RTN", "B0012OX7EO", "B001JH7F42"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 19667}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 37.97, "brand": "TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX HOME ENT", "asin": "B0001IXTDG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514AVSFD7CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Osama"}

{"description": "Taking a page fromThe Animatrix,Dark Furyis part of a new trend of bridging theatrical sequels. As an official product of a franchise, the 35-minute anime benefits from having the original actors voice the characters, including Vin Diesel as Riddick. This story opens with the new action hero and the two other survivors ofPitch Blackalready caught by a giant spaceship filled with dread. The sinewy leader has a unique--and creepy--jail for master villains and she has her sights set on Riddick. The film--indeed the series--is indebted to animator Peter Chung, who brings his techno style from hisAeon Fluxseries. His smooth animation for Riddick doesn't reinvent the character as much as give him a new, appealing fluidity.

{"description": "Warner Brothers'Batman: The Animated Series(1992-1995) remains a striking, stylized program that helped to revitalize the familiar comic book hero. Drawing on such diverse influences as Frank Miller's graphic novelThe Dark Knight Returns, the Fleischers'Supermancartoons of the early '40s, and contemporary Japanese animation, the filmmakers stress interesting designs and  cinematography. The Caped Crusader prowls a sinister, Art Deco-styled world of tall verticals, sharp angles, silhouettes, searchlights, and grid-like shadows cast by window frames. Its visual pizzazz  eclipses Filmation's pallid kidvid,The Batman/Superman Hour(CBS, 1968), which ran off and on in various incarnations through 1981. Many of the same artists worked on the Batman animated features (e.g.,Mask of the Phantasm(1993),Batman Beyond--The Movie(1999)), which display similar strengths and weaknesses.Ironically,Batman: The Animated Serieslooks better in stills than it does in motion. The artists fail to stylize the movements of the characters to match the dramatic settings, as Genndy Tartakovsky and his crew did inSamurai Jack. Batman uses sophisticated computers to combat the well-known villains--the Joker, the Penguin, Mr. Freeze, Catwoman--as well as some less celebrated baddies: Manbat, Clayface, The Mad Hatter. The bad guys cram a lot of plotting and scheming into each 22-minute episode, but the violence is kept to a broadcast standards minimum.The Dark Knight's First Knighteasily ranks as the most interesting of the extras. Producers Bruce Timm and Eric Radomski recount the genesis of the series, and show their mini-pilot, which is more violent and more fully animated. If the complete episodes had matched the pilot, the series would have been much more exciting. (Unrated, suitable for ages 8 and older: violence, mild grotesque imagery)--Charles Solomon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002ZMHWM", "B0007XG43W", "B000B7QCHC", "B000YDBP84", "B000A9QKLE", "B002LWJ510", "B000A9QKL4", "B0002ZMHX6", "B000CSTK42", "B000B7QCGS", "B00LT1JHLW", "B000F4RH8E", "B000A9QKLO", "B000GYI336", "B000LE1798", "B0009UZG28", "B001QIVEVE", "B000LE17A2", "B000CSTK3S", "B003XMZVHY", "B000GYI33Q", "B000CEXFZ6", "B00DP9MDE4", "B00005Y71G", "B0089TQ70Q", "B003L7DK88", "B004L9GM3A", "B005SH63HO", "B000F4RH8O", "B003ITZBVS", "B000UPMZ1M", "B0016OM3WC", "B000M2E32W", "B001QIVEVO", "B00GJ6HQDI", "B0036EH3XY", "B005CSYQ2S", "B000FZETS4", "B00005Y71J", "B001614E68", "B003ITZBVI", "B002DYKPF6", "B002DYKPFQ", "B002FGUHBE", "B000PFSYO4", "B000A59PLU", "1401216676", "B0058YPN4G", "B00HFWETQW", "B00DP9RYDY", "B002YOKVUY", "B002A5EBLW", "B00A2LOAKI", "B001A5ES9I", "B003UN2ICM", "B00LFW6BA0", "B00IGVJH0E", "1401231152", "B00GD9GNEY", "B002JUFPJK", "B0007RT9MG", "B002JUFPXQ", "B008RV5K5E", "B000OPODNG", "B002JUFPWW", "B000PE0G0A", "B00GZ0ML4C", "B00CENSU1W", "1401207529", "1401235425", "B000ATQYVA", "B00GZ0ML2Y", "B001PU8N26", "B0089AD8J8", "B005SH63KG", "1401237789", "B0007XFZMS", "1563893428", "1401242340", "B000BQ7J9I", "B006PA0WF2", "1401237886", "1401223176", "B00HMOW9SS", "B0002W4SY0", "B000FS9MUQ", "1401232590", "B001OXLGJ6", "B0007NFMCG", "B00HMOW9YM", "B000HEWEFI", "B0001FVDG4", "B00I40K6RU", "B001614FX0", "B002K0WBDM", "B00782O82Y", "B000HWZ4R0", "B0007G89FU", "B0018TNMCA", "B0001I55N8"], "bought_together": ["B0002ZMHWM", "B0007XG43W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007XG43W", "B000B7QCHM", "B0002ZMHWM", "B001QIVEVE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3034}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 17.49, "brand": "WEA", "asin": "B00023E894", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/610e-N0uSgL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Batman: The Animated Series, Volume One (DC Comics Classic Collection)"}
{"description": "The key to any Jane Austen adaptation is finding the perfect balance of  romantic yearning and savage, satirical wit. Austen'sEmmahas  these two qualities at their most exquisite and tantalizing, and this BBC  adaptation from 1972 serves the novel with complete satisfaction.  Delightful Doran Godwin captures not only the title character's good  nature and resilient will, but also her exasperating self-satisfaction and  ungovernable manipulative impulses. Believing herself to be acting in everyone's  best interests, Emma takes the lower-class Harriet Smith (Debbie Bowen)  under her wing and sets out to find the girl a suitable husband,  disregarding what havoc she wreaks along the way. Her foolish father  (Donald Eccles) cannot temper Emma's fancies; only the stern Mr. Knightly  (John Carson) offers any reason or restraint. This sprightly adaptation is  far superior to the mediocre1996 film(starring Gwyneth Paltrow) and on  par with the ingeniousClueless, which cunningly translates the  story to a Beverly Hills high school. The luxurious span of a six-part  miniseries gives this version the opportunity to revel in Emma's every  deliciously misguided moment.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000244F9G", "B000244FF0", "B000244F8M", "B000244FDW", "B002DY9KR0", "B002XTBE6K", "B0007OY2P8", "0767020308", "B000Z27HLS", "B00003JRCQ", "B004SIP7AS", "B00G6HO368", "B000784WMW", "B000GRUQKQ", "0800141660", "B0012Q3T6I", "B00AF82WTO", "B0012OVCE6", "B000244FFU", "B001PJRAUS", "B000A8AXXG", "B004XVMCMQ", "B0009PVZM8", "B004JMSIQS", "B005GRF2UK", "B00062IZ0Y", "B0009PVZIW", "B0080QOL10", "B0018YCF50", "B000ZS8GW6", "B001TJYFRU", "B000784WNQ", "B000Z27HMW", "B000FQIRYA", "B00H4ZEFTQ", "B000QGE86K", "B000ION7AI", "B005T0OY5S", "B0002S648C", "B00005JOA0", "B000M2E32C", "B004P7CNZO", "B00CEBJC20", "B000MGBLHS", "B00065GX96", "B0053Q9DHW", "B0006B2AA6", "B0000AQS3P", "B00D49YEHO", "B0045HCJJY", "B000AYEL6U", "B000E1ZBGS", "B0080QOL1A", "B000N4SHOE", "B001D8W7EU", "B0045HCJQW", "B000BITVAG", "B004HHX9T6", "B002M2Z3BA", "B000EMGF3A"], "bought_together": ["B000244F9G", "B000244FF0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002XTBE6K", "0767020308", "B000244F9G", "B004XVMCMQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 73358}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 18.0, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000244F64", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51iu3Os6t8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Emma (BBC, 1972)"}
{"description": "The enduring appeal of one of television's best and most controversial programs comes through loud (literally) and clear onAll in the Family: The Complete Third Season, some 10 hours of compelling, entertaining viewing that serve as a timely reminder that even as TV in the new millennium has seemingly become more diverse and inclusive, with its many gay-themed shows and, gasp, proliferation of all manner of minorities, it has lost the kind of bite that the beloved (well, by some folks, anyway) bigot Archie Bunker used to bring to the small screen.All 24 episodes (there is no bonus material or extra features) from the '72-'73 season of executive producer Norman Lear's sitcom are contained here, and those unfamiliar with the show may well find them a bit startling. The language is part of it; Archie's frequent use of terms like \"gook\" and \"fag\" would never pass muster in these politically correct times. Yet even more striking isAll in the Family's subject matter. Again and again, serious themes like politics (the '72 presidential race, pitting Richard Nixon against George McGovern, is mentioned frequently), racism (\"Archie in the Hospital\" is just one episode dealing with that issue), the death penalty and violence in the name of religion (\"Archie Is Branded\"), sexual assault (\"Gloria, the Victim\"), and gun control (\"Archie and the Editorial\") are handled with remarkable frankness.  At the center of it all, of course, is Carroll O'Connor's Archie, who remains belligerent, boorish, and downright mean to the bitter end. Whether he's bribing an IRS agent, cheating an insurance company, or just being pig-headed in general, Archie is utterly unrepentant; basically, he never does the right thing, a trait that's somehow both irritating and refreshing.All in the Familyis hardly perfect; the dysfunctional family's ceaseless squabbling and shouting--usually involving Archie and liberal son-in-law Mike Stivic (Rob Reiner), although wife Edith (the brilliant Jean Stapleton) and daughter Gloria (Sally Struthers) aren't immune--eventually becomes tiresome and shrill. But for the most part, the show's acting, writing (which manages to be very funny as well as incisive), and point of view make this set a must-have.--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002E58FTW", "B002E58FTM", "B002E58FT2", "B002E58FTC", "B002E58FU6", "B005KK2FTO", "B000TD0PHG", "B000TD2KY2", "B00465I13S", "B0000DFZ5O", "B0002NY8R6", "B000KGGIL4", "B000EHSVBE", "B007KFZ85K", "B000QFCDAO", "B00008R9MC", "B000HIVIOM", "B000EBGFQI", "B001DMVZKI", "B000E3L7FK", "B000MGTQ6G", "B0007US79Y", "B000NOIX7K", "B00D2UMHB0", "B001DPHDBU", "B008L0YMZA", "B00008WJEZ", "B0000BV1XX", "B001DMVZJO", "B0007YXRCW", "B008KZX7W0", "B00005JLEX", "B000C1VBAA", "B00005JKU0", "B007N31YH0", "B007KFZ7UQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002E58FUG", "B002E58FTW", "B002E58FTM", "B002E58FT2"]}, "price": 14.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 187198}, "asin": "B000255LG6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510TWK3HJTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "All in the Family : Season 3"}

{"description": "American sitcoms usually have a bland, likable central character who has to cope with obnoxious acquaintances--who usually provide most of the actual comedy. The British smartly put the comic personalities front and center, andKeeping Up Appearanceshas one of the best: The petty, pretentious, tyrannical Hyacinth Bucket (played by the impressive Patricia Routledge), a dowdy middle-class social climber with a piercing voice and an unshakable faith in herself. Upon learning that her mailman has seven children, she declares disapprovingly, \"Quite an achievement when you have to be up so early.\" Whether she's scheming to invite a minor local celebrity to a garden party or scowling at an enormous dog left in her driveway, Hyacinth terrorizes all around her, particularly her long-suffering husband Richard (Clive Swift), who takes a small delight in subverting her efforts from time to time; her trembling neighbors Elizabeth and Emmett (Josephine Tewson and David Griffin), who scarcely leave their house lest they be invited in to coffee; and her sexually frustrated lower-class sisters Daisy and Rose (Judy Cornwell and Mary Millar) and Daisy's layabout husband Onslow (Geoffrey Hughes), who longs to be left in peace to eat chips and watch the races. Though Americans aren't as class-conscious as the Brits, snobbery is universal, and Keeping Up Appearances has developed an appreciative cult following on this side of the Atlantic.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002I9TZHA", "B0002F6BT2", "B0009S2SOY", "B002LFPAUC", "B001JV5BBC", "B0035JHYIY", "B000SINSX0", "B00007JZUC", "B000CDSS22", "B00007JZUF", "B0016RNLZW", "B001B3LIQU", "B008FTWT70", "B002BIULNA", "B00JJRLG7G", "B00AQJANI4", "B000784WKO", "B00007ELCZ", "B001B3LIPG", "B009A68ESA", "B00C2IJJGY", "B00FPPQYXM", "B001T21R6Y", "0563369752", "B002LFPAUM", "B00197YZ7C", "B001TKK3KC", "B009VYAVYG", "B00EF4U7AK", "B00KYCA4QY", "B000ERVK6W", "B00BCXVYOK", "B000A0GOIM", "B005DVIPY4", "B0035JHYJ8", "B0093I4Y3Y", "B000YIGNKY", "B005SH65FO", "B00BVMX9O0", "B00008DP4B", "B00C12ZISE", "B00008L3PB", "B00009XN37", "B004SGWYYM", "B00007JZUE", "B00A0HT99G", "B00JK47BHM", "B00F1BFRA6", "B00GD7UO4G", "B00A27O0N4", "B009DS6YGO", "B00B89X0CW", "0563371072", "B0001JXP8E", "B00AO1RKFS", "B005GP7EVC", "B004HHX9H8", "B004K4FULQ", "B000EMG91S", "B00HUAH14Q", "B0009UZG78", "B004H0ZHD4", "B0007QS28E", "B003PIUIOM", "B0010V4VK8", "B00447G2SY", "B000VDDE18", "B001V7UXG2", "B00HRUQB5O", "B0000ALPJL", "B0009NSCTY", "B008UQUS26", "B008HUSFTS", "B00EH4KOWE", "B0000E6XDU", "B004EYT8BA", "B00004Z4TO", "B00BW4S87A", "B0009S2SQ2", "B0000ALPJN", "B00IXPWGIS", "B000TGJ8B2", "B00CL0MCN0", "B00C7A8WWO", "B008B4LRMC", "B00E5G03I4", "B0028AEO0M", "B000FOQ04Q", "B006JY3OH2", "B000EOTUTE", "B000BITVAG", "B0000ALPJM", "B0000TG8UW", "B004AV5H3U", "B0006Z2L06", "B0090XLDO0", "B004EYT8EC", "B004KVXCB4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00EF4U7AK", "B002I9TZHA", "B002LFPAUC", "B000079DND"]}, "price": 89.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 56496}, "asin": "B0002F6BTC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61NCR0WQXHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Keeping Up Appearances: The Full Bouquet"}
{"description": "As the fourth season ofAngelstarts, everything is still as we left it: Angel has been sunk to the bottom of the sea in an iron box by his inexplicable and vindictive son Connor and Cordelia has been summoned to higher realms to await orders. Gunn and Fred are left in the Hyperion Hotel, unsure about what has happened to their friends, and Lilah is working hard to seduce Wesley to the dark side. In the first few episodes, some of this is resolved but it's almost immediately replaced by far worse crises: prophesies of doom accumulate more rapidly even than usual in this wonderfully gloomy show and a horned rock-like beast rains fire on Los Angeles. This last year isAngel's most tightly dramatic season yet--with a story arc of surprising intensity punctuated by the show's usual wit and sexiness.Season 4 is presented on DVD in Dolby 2.0 Surround Sound and anamorphic widescreen. It comes with insightful, and often hilarious, commentaries on seven of the 22 episodes as well as featurettes--a series overview, profiles of the characters of Jasmine and the Beast, a farewell to the Hyperion Hotel (the characters' base for three seasons), and a discussion of the apocalypse that Angel has to deal with from episode 7 onwards).--Roz Kaveney", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000I0QLS2", "B000I0QLRI", "B000I0QLR8", "B000I0QLQY", "B000EHSVN2", "B000EHSVMS", "B000EHSVM8", "B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVLE", "B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVKK", "B0006IUE16", "B0009W5J4Q", "B007H9CNOI", "B000CCBCGM", "B0024FAR66", "B000B5XOW0", "B0046XG48O", "B000OIOPHC", "B000JLTRIG", "B000RO6JYK", "B001992NWO", "B000ERVJM2", "B00AMDA2QC", "B00006J3WH", "B001L1S1OY", "B002JVWR4A", "1593078226", "B000HT3P60", "B0053O89IS", "B002JVWR4U", "B000GG4Y6O", "B009LDCXNY", "B00HUPC5X8", "B0000AQS0F", "B000BOH990", "B00JF5GAZA", "B009LDD4V4", "B000FP2OPY", "B000X5SPBI", "B000HD1482", "B002CLKP00", "B003L77G8I", "B00133QNSG", "B002JVWRAO", "B000N6SE4U", "B000G1R4SO", "159307784X", "B000T9OP7G", "B0011FLGZQ", "B000QDLSR0", "B003L77GGK", "B00008KA57", "B006LG74Q0", "B000FIMG68", "B00001R3O1", "B0009JE6FC", "B001MVWRMU", "1569717516", "B001FB4W0C", "B009LDCWWG", "B002N5N5MK", "B001B7CNZ6", "1595826106", "B000NOKFGW", "B000F8O2PG", "B0001JXPPC", "B000O77SMW", "B00020H9NO", "B000R7GKQE", "B005X4P3DC", "B0085KGG96", "B003BV8I7C", "B004YM6JI2", "B00006FD9N", "B000BOH98G", "0785168370", "B000PMFRTC", "B001M5UDGS", "B000CNE0SS", "1613770596", "1593078269", "B00133QNS6", "B00IWTVDUW", "B001MVWRN4", "B00243FQFA", "B000A5045Q", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B001MVWRMK", "B0008FPJ7Q", "B00BBXSPES", "B001AQO43M", "B0024FAD9C", "B000BOH986", "159307963X", "B00133QNRW", "B003L77GH4", "B000GG4Y28", "B002XD0J80", "B00008KGT0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000I0QLRI", "B000I0QLR8", "B000I0QLQY", "B000I0QLS2"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 165905}, "asin": "B0002HS74C", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PP1E7PZZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Angel - Season Four"}

{"description": "The facts have become legend.Star Trek, the NBC series that premiered on September 8, 1966, has become a touchstone of international popular culture. It struggled through three seasons that included cancellation and last-minute revival, and turned its creator, Gene Roddenberry, into the progenitor of an intergalactic phenomenon. Eventually expanding to encompass five separate TV series, an ongoing slate of feature films, and a fan base larger than the population of many third-world countries, theStar Trekuniverse began not with a Big Bang but with a cautious experiment in network TV programming. Even before its premiere episode (\"The Man Trap\") was aired,Star Trekhad struggled to attain warp-drive velocity, barely making it into the fall '66 NBC lineup.The series' original pilot, \"The Cage,\" featured Jeffrey Hunter as U.S.S.Enterprisecaptain Christopher Pike--a variation of the role that would eventually catapult William Shatner to TV stardom. Filmed in 1964, the pilot was rejected by NBC the following year, but the network made a rare decision to order a second pilot. \"Where No Man Has Gone Before\" was filmed in 1965, and only one character from the previous pilot remained--a pointy-eared alien named Spock (played by Leonard Nimoy), whom Roddenberry had retained despite network disapproval. The second pilot was accepted, and production onStar Trekbegan in earnest with the filming of its first regular episode, \"The Corbomite Maneuver.\"Never a ratings success despite a growing population of devoted fans,Star Trekwas canceled after its second season, prompting a letter-writing campaign that resulted in the series' third-season renewal. It was a mixed blessing, since Roddenberry had departed as producer to protest the network's neglect, andStar Trek's third season contained most of the series' weakest episodes. And yet, the show continued to \"to explore strange new worlds&#x85;to seek out new life and new civilizations&#x85;to boldly go where no man [a phrase later amended to \"no one\"] has gone before.\"There were milestones along the way. The first interracial kiss on network primetime TV (between Shatner and series co-star Nichelle Nichols) furthered a richly positive and expansive view of a better, nobler future for humankind. The series offered a timelessly appealing balance of humor, imagination, and character depth. And at least one episode (Harlan Ellison's \"The City on the Edge of Forever\") ranks among the finest science fiction stories in any popular medium. Beloved by long-time fans in spite of its cheesy sets and costumes, and the now-dated trappings of late-1960s American culture, \"classicTrek\" has aged remarkably well, and its sense of adventure and idealism continues to live long and prosper.--Jeff ShannonThe three 2004 DVD sets collect all 79 episodes of the show, including \"The Cage\" in both a restored color version and the original, never-aired version that alternates between color and black and white. Each set is supplemented by over an hour of featurettes incorporating new and old interviews with Shatner, Nimoy, other cast members, and producers, and there's also some vintage footage of Gene Roddenberry. Accompanying the 20-minute seasonal recaps (\"To Boldly Go...\") are a number of interesting featurettes: \"The Birth of a Timeless Legacy\" examines the two pilot episodes and the development of the crew; \"Sci-Fi Visionaries\" discusses the series' great science fiction writers; Nimoy debunks various rumors in \"Reflections of Spock\"; \"Kirk, Spock & Bones: The Great Trio\" focuses on the interplay among Kirk, Spock, and Dr. McCoy (DeForest Kelley); and, in what is probably his lastStar Trekappearance, James Doohan (Scotty), slowed by Alzheimer's but still with a twinkle in his eye, recalls his voiceover roles and his favorite episodes.  As they've done for many of thefeature-film special editions, Michael Okuda and Denise Okuda provide a pop-up text commentary on four of the episodes filled with history, trivia, and dry wit. It's the first commentary of any kind for aStar TrekTV show, but an audio commentary is still overdue. The technical specs are mostly the same as otherTrekTV series--Dolby 5.1, English subtitles--but with the welcome addition of the episode trailers. The plastic cases are an attempt to replicate some of the fun packaging of the series' European DVD releases, but it's a bit clunky, and the paper sleeve around the disc case seems awkward and crude. Still, the sets are a vast improvement both in terms of shelf space and bonus features compared to the oldtwo-episode discs, which were released before full-season boxed sets became the model for television DVDs.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002I9Z8I0", "B000RZIGVS", "B002I9Z8GM", "B00AZMFJYA", "B000HEWEJ4", "B00062RCC6", "B00062IDDS", "B000AOEMXM", "B002HWRYJE", "B00144P9RA", "0790730979", "B0007DA3V6", "B0011FLGZQ", "B005DKS1Z8", "B00KTZALDC", "B000ATQYWY", "B009RNK0YC", "B00DB97LU4", "B001CQONOA", "B001M0BSVM", "B0009JE6FC", "B009AGEZ8S", "B001HUHBBS", "B00FEVZ960", "B000063V8T", "B00005JM5Z", "B001AZIRZO", "B00E5G03I4", "B004IK30MI", "B001DXS4DI", "B00IXPWGIS", "B00003CXCT", "B001TH16DI", "B00005JKFR", "B000V6LSO0", "B000EXZFRQ", "B00GX7D5G0", "B0007DA3VG", "B001DMVZKI", "B007V4ETS2", "B001DZOCZU", "B005LVIP1E", "B00026L7OU", "B00DYQ1G78", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B000EHSVB4", "B0001NBNGQ", "B00GTZWZH6", "6303961614", "B007Y1NNAW", "B008RJ6TTC", "B00GD7UO4G", "B00EEEHLKU", "B000F8O2OW", "B001E75QH0", "B002I9Z8GW", "B004LWZW42", "B000BGR1B4", "B005LAIHPE", "B000E6ESEY", "B00KB614HQ", "B00J4LMHMK", "B001CDLATY", "B000BF0C8E", "B00DXLO086", "B003L77G6A", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B00BN0WQ5I", "B000EHQU0S", "B00K7IPFSM", "B00AEFXYJA", "B00DXLO0D6", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B000SULWJA", "B0000AQS0F", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00BUWD7E8", "B000BW7QWW", "B000VXWK86", "B00471JSRE", "0792844890", "B00H57HOSC", "B0090SI56Y", "B001AEF6BI", "B0053O89WY", "B008JFURII", "B00I462Y60", "B00DL48BM6", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00IKM5LXG", "B00JDCP0QA", "B004EXWGIS", "B00IWULQQ2", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00CTSDDVO", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B008JFUNKU", "B006WN5W5M", "B00009W5CA", "B005G4FFBE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002I9Z8I0", "B001DHXT3Y", "B000VDDDY6", "B0017VG69U"]}, "price": 84.05, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 151044}, "asin": "B0002JJBZY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41CCC9QNB4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete Seasons 1-3"}

{"description": "If you have even a passing interest in Stevie Ray Vaughan's peerless mastery of urban blues guitar, youmustownLive at Montreux 1982 & 1985. Spaced almost exactly three years apart, these concerts (60 and 93 minutes, respectively) represent the Texan blues god at his fiery best, with Double Trouble (drummer Chris Layton and bassist Tommy Shannon) laying the solid foundation upon which SRV built a Fender-driven sound as fierce as it was perfectly refined. The '82 show was truly \"success in disguise,\" because despite booing from a festival audience lulled by a day of acoustic blues, and the stunned dejection that SRV felt after persevering through a uncompromising set, this was the turning point in SRV's career, leading to post-show encounters with Jackson Browne and David Bowie, who proved instrumental in bringing Stevie's music to an appreciative global audience.When Stevie, Chris, and Tommy returned to Switzerland three years later, with organist Reese Wynans adding rich new dimension to the Double Trouble sound, the Montreux crowd was primed for a rip-snorting set, and SRV's jubilant response is a joyous thing to witness. One of SRV's favorite bluesmen, Johnny Copeland, appears for a three-song triumph in a set that's uniformly superior and ecstatically energized. Basic three-camera coverage is all you need, although guitar students--for whom this DVD is a godsend--will surely wish for more emphasis on SRV's picking and fretwork. Recording quality is superb in the Montreux tradition, with 5.1-channel remixes that surpass the original masters. A splendid 23-minute documentary features retrospective interviews with Layton, Shannon, Browne, and John Mayer, and the accompanying booklet includes a heartfelt reminiscence from Bowie. Stevie Ray may be gone, butLive at Montreuxensures that his gold-standard legacy will endure.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["157330056X", "6305019681", "B000OHZKJA", "B003KUSUE0", "157330087X", "B00377V6J2", "B000BI1YT2", "B0055IU3GI", "B004JR3ONA", "B00IPL286U", "B00005RGPY", "B0054YH7RQ", "B0018M6J72", "B000VI6T6U", "B00AANGHXQ", "0316160695", "B000VR824S", "B00008G90N", "B00428CPUY", "B000VT56XQ", "B0060ANVAU", "B00FLDG52I", "B000PC8AFU", "B003XMKMTQ", "B00CFK5JKY", "B0060ANUWY", "B000051XZF", "B00000ICN9", "B0060ANVE6", "B000BM7U82", "B004FRVE18", "B00008G90M", "B004NCOQVA", "B00752H9V4", "6305610460", "B00006SFLX", "B00FLDG5BE", "B000OPP7LS", "1617740225", "1617130303", "B003MX5OOY", "B002L5GQGY", "B0073SI9E6", "142348598X", "B00006L3J4", "B00008PX8P", "B0054YH7YO", "B000050IKX", "B00005U122", "B00000ICN8", "B0000DJZ81", "B00E0HJDV6", "B003VB5E2E", "0316160687", "B0002KP54E", "B0000E2FLC", "B0012GMWLQ", "B000KHX7AS", "630463949X", "B00000268O", "B00069YDWQ", "B001NP8PQM", "B000002BYA", "B00066VURU", "B00092ZMDY", "B000654YR4", "B000N3SOSY", "B0013K1ALE", "B0024EWOYA", "B00F031WB8", "B00004XMSE", "B0085KGHI6", "B00EL6NWB8", "B0012IWNYU", "B0009E3234", "B004EZIKHM", "B00DNJ99F2", "B00FKIB3XA", "B00008H2I9", "B0080QOK70", "6305076995", "B0060ANKQA", "B007OCD1MQ", "B0009RS088", "1458405494", "B000I5YDAU", "B000UD08HW", "B00BF2RV22", "B0000DZEE3", "0738900370", "B00I5NKPWC", "B00EL6NWT0", "B001DZN602", "B0074JODC6", "B00ILAWJLO", "B0007QS2ES", "B003C1SPX8", "B000IFQLSW", "B0000TB03W", "B0003035CW"], "bought_together": ["6305019681", "157330056X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["6305019681", "157330056X", "B00005RGPY", "B00377V6J2"]}, "price": 13.98, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Blues", "Electric Blues"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Blues", "Modern Blues"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Blues", "Regional Blues", "Texas Blues"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Classic Rock", "Album-Oriented Rock (AOR)"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock", "Blues Rock"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 41034}, "asin": "B0002SPPSC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TZ59APPAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble - Live at Montreux 1982 &amp; 1985"}

{"description": "From the creators ofBatman: The Animated Seriescomes DC Comics' polar opposite: the Man of Steel inSuperman: The Animated Series, Volume One. Like the Dark Knight's series,Superman: The Animated Seriesis a successful, modern telling of the classic story. Superman's tale is already known to most people, enduring as a modern American myth. The challenge for the producers was how to make something old and familiar new again. Quite successfully, they managed to modernize the Superman environment and its characters enough to attract a new audience but also maintained the integrity of the mythos to satisfy longtime fans. What liftsSuperman: The Animated Seriesabove all past Superman shows is its high-quality animation, strong dramatic scripts, a star studded cast, and the creators' willingness to present the show more like a series than a cartoon. It begins with a three-part episode (\"The Last Son of Krypton\") chronicling the last days of Krypton, the introduction of Braniac, Kal-El's trip to Earth, his development into Superman, and finally his introduction to the world. These three episodes lay the foundation for the next 15 adventures that follow, including confrontations with rivals Lex Luthor, Metallo, Braniac, the bizarre Lobo, and others. For fans of Superman, DC Comics, superheroes, the comic genre, and action tales in general,Superman: The Animated Seriesis not to be missed.--Rob Bracco", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000B7QCGS", "B000F4RH8E", "B000B7QCHC", "B0007XG43W", "B0002ZMHWM", "B000CSTK3S", "B000F4RH8O", "B00023E894", "B000GYI33Q", "B000LE17A2", "B000GYI336", "B000CSTK42", "B000LE1798", "B000YDBP84", "B000A9QKLO", "B000A9QKLE", "B000A9QKL4", "B00LT1JHLW", "B000UPMZ1M", "B00005Y71G", "B000M2E32W", "B0016OM3WC", "B000CEXFZ6", "B000FZETS4", "B000F0V0LS", "B0018TNMCA", "B001LK8SQ6", "B005SH63HO", "B003L7DK88", "B00280LZBI", "B000PFSYO4", "B001QIVEVE", "B0009UZG28", "B000A59PLU", "B000OPODNQ", "B001A5ES9I", "B000PE0G0A", "B0007XFZMS", "B001QIVEVO", "B001OD8E4G", "B004L9GM3A", "B002DYKPF6", "B004VWKD3M", "B0000VCZLG", "B002DYKPFQ", "B004QOB8PW", "B000OPODNG", "B00GZ0ML2Y", "6305943389", "B005HN69G4", "B002FGUHBE", "B0081BEZXS", "B00BBAQD6S", "B001614E68", "B0001HAI0E", "B006PA0WF2", "B00HMOW9YM", "B00IGVJH0E", "B00CENSU1W", "B00023E88U", "B001LK8TEM", "B000CEXFZG", "B002A5EBLW", "B00GD9GNEY", "B0001A7V1U", "B00CPEK3NI", "B00CENWUYK", "B003UN2ILS", "B0036EH3XY", "B009OAWMK8", "B000M2E33G", "B00ISDJUYI", "B0007US7CQ", "B003XTUAWI", "B000TSTEJG", "B00GZ0ML4C", "B00GD9GNUS", "B000PC8AKK", "B007RG8ZF2", "B002YOKVUY", "B003UN2ICM", "B000UPMZ1C", "B0000X2ECY", "B000FZETRU", "B002K0WBDM", "B003XTUAHS", "B004EE30C8", "B0016PURB0", "B007KW5MOU", "B002S3Y1LQ", "B003Z8ZCDO", "B00005Y71H", "B003ITZBVS", "B00I099JZK", "B0007VY40E", "B002JUFPXG", "B00DP9RYDY", "B003M8NGLC", "B0027FG29Y", "B007MCSV1O"], "bought_together": ["B000B7QCGS", "B000F4RH8E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000B7QCGS", "B002LWJ510", "B0002ZMHWM", "B000B7QCHC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 73066}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 13.64, "brand": "WEA", "asin": "B0002ZMHX6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61S4EGDCR1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Superman: The Animated Series, Volume 1 (DC Comics Classic Collection)"}
{"description": "The vintage concert footage alone makesFestival Expressa memorable and worthwhile endeavor, offering scintillating performances byJanis Joplin, theBand(their rollicking version of \"Slippin' and Slidin'\" is particularly mind-blowing), theGrateful Dead,Buddy Guy, and others (remember Mashmakhan?). In 1970, during the heyday of the rock festival, promoter Ken Walker decided to organize a traveling musical revue, bringing the mountain to Mohammed, as it were. In five days' time, the festival played in three Canadian cities with the entire conglomeration traveling, playing, and getting smashed together the whole way. Nearly as rewarding as the live performances are the candid scenes of the train ride itself, an endless jam session and party during which musicians of all shapes and sizes let their hair down--musically and otherwise. The contemporary interviews with Walker and some of the surviving musicians aren't particularly noteworthy, except as a way to prove that it all actually happened. Walker comes off as a hero in the film: he treated the musicians like royalty and insisted that the train roll on even though he was losing his shirt. (His financial failure is a large reason why this material stayed in the vaults for so long.) Perhaps the most remarkable scene is an off-the-cuff, LSD-fueled train jam featuring Joplin, the Band's Rick Danko, and the Dead'sJerry Garciaplaying the old chestnut \"Ain't No More Cane.\" Danko is so obliterated that even Janis has to ask him if he's OK--when Janis is worried aboutyourstate of mind, you must be pretty messed up.--Marc Greilsamer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009PBLZE", "B00003CXB1", "B003NOGNX8", "B001FWRZ14", "1573306932", "B00006JU7P", "B005HI4LLO", "B0084NZEWO", "B001NXDSLQ", "B001L7S0F8", "B008PALH1I", "B00IPL286U", "B00HQI823Q", "B0007GADYU", "B00004YZFR", "B0029LD2QW", "B0002WZTJI", "B00ARX2W9C", "B004T5IVXK", "B000E5LEWE", "B001CRRADU", "B00F1W1SKI", "B0034KVTLC", "B00FLDG52I", "B008B1SJOE", "B0085KGHI6", "B0015E6WX4", "B0002GTX8C", "B000EZ7ZZ4", "B0009E3234", "B008NR92SI", "B0018M6J7C", "B002CSC5EC", "B001TLWR46", "B00772M2Y6", "074327749X", "B00B08FLVO", "B00H3JHH6Q", "B002E01M9C", "B0090O07S2", "B000EHSVO6", "B00E34A9FU", "B008HFS4XU", "B00E5MIMHW", "B000W1V5TM", "B000B8IANU", "B00KPHL7K0", "B004QL7JTE", "B00006FDB0", "B00H9GJSR4", "B00DJYKFXG", "B000621484", "B009EAAL60", "B0012GMUR2", "B00104AZ3M", "B00FWSWQX4", "B00DNJ99F2", "B000654YR4", "B0009WFFS6", "B000HDZK1O", "B00005UER0", "B00EUEWRZ8", "B00EO2I6T2", "0062280619", "B005MXQD0G", "B000KJU1HI", "B000I5YDBE", "B000063K0I", "B001NHZ2KM", "B00H9GJRSY", "B000F48D00", "B0000DBJDM", "B003W5C0VM", "B002RVZV9K", "B00CCEHR80", "B000BC8SVA", "B005DJ62MS", "B00078RPGW", "B00ID2TRB0", "B00000JXVL", "B001NP8PQM", "B0012GMVGM", "B00JAD6DLS", "B000021Y7X", "B000AYQJ3I", "1556524056", "B006P0FIAG", "B00BCMT0AQ", "B0000E6FOK", "B00HNTUR1S", "B000A0GP4K", "B0012GMW5M", "B000F0UTTM", "B003ELOQCK", "B002LMOCCC", "0316154490", "B00B08FLT6", "B00I5NKPWC", "B00K0X1PYM", "B009M4KTEM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00H9GJRSY", "B001NXDSLQ", "B00003CXB1", "B0009PBLZE"]}, "price": 17.98, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 46647}, "asin": "B000305ZDO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61TZFCBT1JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Festival Express"}
{"description": "The 4400, which began as a five-week miniseries on the USA Network, is built around a deceptively simple, dramatically rich premise. What if all the people, who had ever been abducted by aliens, were suddenly returned to Earth? What would happen? Although they look exactly as they did when they left, they have no knowledge of where they were or why they were taken. Now some even have special powers, like clairvoyance. As with ABC'sLost, which centers on the survivors of a plane crash,The 4400features a large cast of characters and a host of mysteries to be solved. If the special effects, which are kept to a minimum, can be a little cheesy at times, the concept--and the skillful execution of the concept--easily makes up for it.Produced by Francis Ford Coppola's American Zoetrope and created by Scott Peters (The Outer Limits),The 4400is set in Seattle, where the 4400 are returned. The principal characters include Dennis Ryland (Peter Coyote ofE.T.), the local supervisor of Homeland Security. He's joined by agents Tom Baldwin (Joel Gretsch ofTaken), whose nephew was one of the returnees, and Diana Skouris (Jacqueline McKenzie ofRomper Stomper), who takes in one of the youngest returnees.Guest stars include Michael Moriarty (Law and Order) in \"Pilot\" and Lee Tergeson (Oz) in \"Becoming.\" Billy Campbell (Once and Again) also appears in several episodes as Jordan Collier, a real-estate magnate and returnee who becomes an advocate for others like himself, many of whom are having problems adjusting to a changed world. LikeLost, one of the biggest success stories of 2004,The 4400debuted to strong ratings and was renewed for a full season.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "The H.P. Lovecraft Collection on DVD brings together for the first time films screened over the last 10 years at the H.P. Lovecraft Film Festival. The first volume is Cool Air, based on Lovecraft's famous short story, and follows Randolph Carter as he moves into a squalid boarding house in the summer of 1925. There he becomes friends with a mysterious doctor who revives him after a near-fatal heart attack. Soon after Carter discovers the awful truth about the doctor, and the fragile line that separates life and death. Cool Air features a stellar performance by Jack Donner (Star Trek, Mission Impossible, Stigmata) as Dr. Muoz, and remains a haunting reminder of the power of the human will. The volume also includes the following short films: Nyarlathotep, The Hound, An Imperfect Solution, and The Hapless Antiquarian, in addition to exclusive interviews with the cast & crew of Cool Air, and an interview with author and scholar S.T.

Not a happy place, obviously, and it gets worse when both men realize that they've been chained and pitted against one another by an unseen but apparently omniscient maniac who's screwing with their psyches as payment for past sins.

{"description": "Packed with interviews from genre luminaries including Ray Bradbury, Al Feldstein, George Romero, John Carpenter, Jack Kamen, and Joel Silver, Chip Selby's brilliant doc chronicles the rise of EC's iconic horror comics of the 1950's through their persecution at the hands of Congress and Frederic Wertham's Seduction of the Innocent, and their eventual reappraisal as classics of comic storytelling and eventual translation into the medium of television. The 2-disc DVD set is packed with extras, including an extended director's cut of the film and additional interviews (the roundtable with Bradbury and EC Editor/Artist Al Feldstein is a must-see). --IGN FilmForceThis entertaining documentary examines the rise, fall, and resurgence of horror comics. The program deftly explores the circumstances that led Entertaining Comics (EC) publisher William M. Gaines and artist Al Feldstein to create such gory, darkly funny comic books as Tales from the Crypt and Haunt of Fear. The wildly popular, grisly comics, featuring tales of bloody revenge, caused outraged parents and others to assert that the stories promoted violence and perpetuated juvenile delinquency. Gaines was ultimately forced to discontinue EC in 1954. The briskly edited program bursts with playfully ghastly music, clever sound effects, and iconographic animation. A clever touch finds interviewees appearing with speech bubbles above their heads. Author R. L. Stine and others wax enthusiastic about the influence of these sensational, shocking creations. Including a wealth of extras, this DVD is a must for pop-culture collections. --Booklist, March 1, 2005", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B006BZ8NSE", "0312144865", "B000RXVNCO", "1616552905", "B0009ETCOW", "161655519X", "161655486X", "B000FFJYC0", "B002JHD9D2", "B002GHHHG0", "1888472588", "B0030E5PYO", "B00BTYPW7C", "B000SULWKO", "B0000AOX0F", "1603601031", "0810955954"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B006BZ8NSE", "0312144865", "B0030E5PYO", "B000RXVNCO"]}, "price": 19.06, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 408646}, "asin": "B0006VMS76", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61YBAKCWYDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tales from the Crypt: From Comic Books to Television"}
{"description": "Richard Widmark never had better exercise for his Cagney-like bouncing-ball energy thanNight and the City, a classic film noir about a hustler's meteoric flame-out. Although acknowledged as one of the great noir pictures, it's actually set and shot in London, which gives an exotic, displaced novelty to the usual noir universe. Widmark's performance as Harry Fabian is a jibbering, wheedling, giggling tour de force, as Harry schemes his way to setting up a wrestling match and finally establishing himself as a \"somebody.\" Instead, he manages to irritate the underworld heavies (memorably, Herbert Lom and Francis L. Sullivan) whose fingers are already deeply into the criminal pie. Gene Tierney and Googie Withers are the women--one good, one bad--who witness Harry's descent. This was director Jules Dassin's final project for a Hollywood studio before the blacklist forced him out, and he packs the film with tortured camera angles and spidery noir shadows; the movie's a real visual clambake.Night and the Citywas remade, tiredly, with Robert De Niro in 1992.

{"description": "Glamorous Maddie Hayes (Cybill Shepherd) is an ex-model with a problem--her accountant just ran off with her money. Granted, he did leave her with a few broken-down businesses. One happens to be a detective agency run by charming loudmouth David Addison (Bruce Willis). Her attempt to shutter the agency fails when they stumble across a crime and David convinces Maddie to help him solve it. And with that, one of television's most popular partnerships was born.Moonlightingmade a star out of newcomer Willis and turned Shepherd (Taxi Driver), who had already found fame through fashion and film, into a bona fide TV star.Created for ABC by Glenn Gordon Caron (Remington Steele), the romantic comedy/detective drama was a mid-season replacement that quickly became a hit. There were only six episodes in the first season, including the two-part pilot, but 18 were produced for the second. Rhyming receptionist Agnes DiPesto (Allyce Beasley) was a regular from the start, while Herbert Viola (Ray&#x92;s Curtis Armstrong) wouldn&#x92;t hit the scene until the third season (as with Paul Sorvino and Mark Harmon). The first two seasons attracted an eclectic array of guest stars, including Tim Robbins (\"Gunfight at the So-So Corral\"), Beasley's husband Vincent Schiavelli (\"Next Stop Murder\"), Dana Delany (\"Knowing Her\"), Richard Belzer (\"Twas the Episode Before Christmas\"), and Whoopi Goldberg (\"Camille\"), who earned an Emmy nomination for her performance. The most notable guest was surely Orson Welles, who introduces the black and white noir spoof \"The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice.\" It would be his final TV appearance.Moonlightingran for three more years. While the Emmy-winning Willis would abandon TV for the big screen, Shepherd found subsequent small screen success withCybill. Caron, meanwhile, would launch another mid-season replacement series which became a surprise hit: NBC'sMediumwith Patricia Arquette.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "From Hollywood's legendary Cocoanut Grove to the pioneering conquest of the wild blue yonder, Martin Scorsese'sThe Aviatorcelebrates old-school filmmaking at its finest. We say \"old school\" only because Scorsese's love of golden-age Hollywood is evident in his approach to his subject--Howard Hughes in his prime (played by Leonardo DiCaprio in his)--and especially in his technical mastery of the medium reflecting his love for classical filmmaking of the studio era. Even when he's using state-of-the-art digital trickery for the film's exciting flight scenes (including one of the most spectacular crashes ever filmed), Scorsese's meticulous attention to art direction and costume design suggests an impassioned pursuit of craftsmanship from a bygone era; every frame seems to glow with gilded detail. And while DiCaprio bears little physical resemblance to Hughes during the film's 20-year span (late 1920s to late '40s), he efficiently captures the eccentric millionaire's golden-boy essence, and his tragic descent into obsessive-compulsive seclusion. Bolstered by Cate Blanchett's uncannily accurate portrayal of Katharine Hepburn as Hughes' most beloved lover,The Aviatoris easily Scorsese's most accessible film, inviting mainstream popularity without compromising Scorsese's artistic reputation. As compelling crowd-pleasers go, it's a class act from start to finish.--Jeff ShannonDVD FeaturesIn his commentary track, director Martin Scorsese offers his own impressions of Howard Hughes and rattles off his memories of experiencing Hughes's films.  He mentions how he made Cate Blanchett watch every Katharine Hepburn film from the '30s on the big screen, and observes that Kate Beckinsale had \"a real sense of the stature of a Hollywood goddess.\"  But in general he doesn't talk much about the craft of making the film.  That area is covered better by editor Thelma Schoonmaker, who also appears on the commentary track, and producer Michael Mann makes a few appearances (all were recorded separately).  The picture is brilliant, but the 5.1 sound is not as aggressive in the rear speakers and subwoofer as one might expect, other than some nice surround effects in theHell's Angelsflying sequence.The second disc collects almost three hours of features.  There's one unnecessary deleted scene, and an 11-minute making-of featurette that's basically the cast and director heaping praise on each other.  More interesting are the short featurettes on visual effects (including the XF-11 scene, of course), production design, costumes, hair and makeup, and score, and Loudon Wainwright discusses his and his children's musical performances.  Historical perspective is provided by spotlights on Hughes's role in aviation and his obsessive-compulsive disorder, and a 43-minute Hughes documentary from the History Channel (part of the Modern Marvels series, it focuses on his mechanical innovations and spends less than a minute on his movies).  More unusual are DiCaprio and Scorsese's appearance on an OCD panel, and a half-hour interview segment DiCaprio did with Alan Alda.--David HoriuchiThe Personalities ofThe AviatorClick the links to explore more movies by these stars.Leonardo DiCaprioasHoward Hughes\"Sometimes I truly fear that I... am losing my mind.

{"description": "Even in the 21st century, very few film stars create and define their own genre--and certainly not in the complete way Bette Davis did.The Bette Davis Collectiongives an exceptionally good survey of essential Bette, with four of the five films absolute knock-down classics from her long reign at Warner Bros. Davis's personality was so strong that she tended to overpower her directors, but William Wyler was one of the few to maintain his own distinctive style with her, andThe Letter(1940) is a triumph for both of them. At a humid Malaysian plantation, Davis kills a man in the brilliant opening sequence, and the remainder is a darkly suggestive unraveling of the complicated explanation.Dark Victory(1939) andNow, Voyager(1942) would be on anybody's list of most representative Davis pictures. In the former, she's a doomed heiress nobly losing her eyesight, a multiple-handkerchief situation that proved one of her biggest hits.Voyagerallows Davis one of her favored techniques (appearing frumpy for at least part of her performance) as a mother-dominated spinster who comes out of her shell. Her match with Paul Henreid--and the music of Max Steiner--turns this into one luscious melodrama.IfMr. Skeffington(1944) is not as celebrated as those films, it is nevertheless a characteristic Warners work-out. Davis wasn't shy about playing unsympathetic roles, and Fanny Skeffington--vain, selfish, married for practicality--is an exasperating tour de force. She gets good support from Claude Rains as the sensible, adoring husband.The Star(1952) is no classic, but its Pirandellian aspects will appeal to the actress's fans:  Bette plays a washed-up Oscar-winning star desperate to get herself back in the public eye (think if it as a less witty postscript toAll About Eve). There's some hint the main character is modeled more on Joan Crawford than Bette herself, in which case Davis must have loved playing it.Extras are modest, with short featurettes giving background on three of the discs, and director Vincent Sherman providing commentary forMr. Skeffington. But the films themselves, and their neurotically intense star, are quite capable of standing alone.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0012OX7DA", "B0012KSUTK", "B000EU1Q40", "B000EU1Q1I", "B00J2TCHP6", "B0008ENID4", "B00466JALY", "B00027JYLM", "B000XNZ7NO", "B00006RCO1", "B008BFSMBA", "B0079R1KVA", "B000EU1Q2C", "B00005RERS", "B000UJCAK4", "B004H83IFU", "B000KGGJ1I", "B000F7CMRC", "B00K8CQ1Q2", "B0087ZG7OI", "B0007OY2O4", "B00269OW66", "B0009S4IJM", "B001D8W7EU", "B0009NZ2MO", "B00AEBBA7W", "B000E6ESWG", "B0035Q636Q", "B001ASQ9OC", "B0016MOWPU", "B005UZNC7I", "B00KIZY3XW", "B00003CXBZ", "B00K6D1S7A", "B00114XLUA", "B009GJVL4K", "B00008LDNZ", "B00074DY0M", "B000I2JDF8", "B000EU1Q1S", "B003L1ZYY2", "B0006B2AA6", "B00004XPPK", "B000244F2S", "B0037RBVLU", "B000OFOJ30", "B00114XLTQ", "B002ID094Y", "B001707XBQ", "B0047BXR1C", "B001709O9A", "B005VPNJ2A", "B000YRY7VC", "B00JX3SIE0", "B0090XPGUM", "B00AEBB89C", "B000FYJ624", "B00CLF822A", "B000E6ESXK", "B001QFFBAM", "B00K6D1SAC", "B00004VVMZ", "B004UOHNCA", "B00005RDRP", "B0024FAG6W", "B000MGBLHS", "B00AATUZQA", "B00170FHZ0", "B000E0OE1M", "B001OSC4G0", "B000EU1Q22", "B008NNSDSC", "B0007TKNKQ", "B001ARDBXU", "B0024FAG7Q", "B002KGREFQ", "B0007RTB9M", "B0007R4SZY", "B00170DEAA", "B003NN9ZCK", "B001FBNQYA", "B004DK9DQ0", "B0024FAG8A", "B00000IPHP", "B00AATV07S", "B002EAYE7E", "B0012GVMIK", "B0007OY2PS", "B00114XLUU", "B00074DY0W", "B007FQXEQO", "0399132465", "B0010KHOSA", "B000MTEFV4", "B00K6D1R0I", "B004K4FUT8", "B00GOC752E", "B00JX3SHIC", "B008CZDWKK", "B000WMA6HS"], "bought_together": ["B0012OX7DA", "B0012KSUTK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004H83IFU", "B0012OX7DA", "B0012KSUTK", "B008BFSMBA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 182994}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 45.99, "brand": "", "asin": "B0008ENIOI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51LuYRnrUdL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Bette Davis Collection (The Star / Mr. Skeffington / Dark Victory / Now, Voyager / The Letter)"}
{"description": "The Emmy-winning first season was an auspicious beginning. By its second season, the classic theme song \"Love is All Around\" has been revamped with an even more optimistic outlook: \"You're gonna make it after all.\" In the sophomore season of this instant gold-standard sitcom, the ace writing staff and peerless ensemble begin to flesh out the iconic characters. Gruff Lou Grant (Ed Asner, enjoying his second Emmy-winning season) reveals his more loveable side when he discovers his son-in-law out with another woman in \"The Six-and-a-Half-Year Itch.\" Vain Ted Baxter (Ted Knight) becomes a more sympathetic character in \"Cover Boy,\" featuring the hilariously preening Jack Cassidy as Ted's competitive brother, and \"And Now, Sitting in for Ted Baxter,\" in which a substitute anchor earns higher ratings than the vacationing Ted. Mary, the sweetheart of prime time, is still something of a pushover (in \"Feeb,\" she feels compelled to write a letter of recommendation for an extraordinarily incompetent secretary), but she develops the backbone to stand up to an anti-Semite who disapproves of Rhoda in one of the season's best episodes, \"Some of My Best Friends Are Rhoda.\" The indelible friendship between Mary and Rhoda (Valerie Harper, also earning her second consecutive Emmy) is sorely tested when they become temporary roommates in \"Where There's Smoke, There's Rhoda.\" As with the most enduring shows,The Mary Tyler Moore Showeschewed topical humor that would date the series, and instead, mined its more universal and timeless humor from the wellspring of the characters. More than 30 years later, there is still, as ever, something aboutMary.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BOH8YQ", "B00005JLIC", "B000EXDS02", "B0011N19HI", "B002WN8IR0", "B003VTKZ84", "B001O4KBN2", "B000A9QKSM", "B000E6ES9Y", "B000YKYT1M", "B002C8YSBU", "B000G6BL7O", "B003CNQPME", "B00144K5M4", "B000QUEQ6I", "B00009VRF0", "B000EQ5PTQ", "B0001IN0BC", "B0000AUXVS", "B00GHH9HW2", "B00KTZALDC", "B0000AZKKP", "B00016XN48", "B00HNGC56G", "B0007WFY4S", "B0006Q93BU", "B001OXLGK0", "B002E58FT2", "B00HRUQB5O", "B004083REE", "B000MGBSH6", "B0002NY8R6", "B002E58FTW", "B0030ATZH6", "B002E58FTM", "B00008EYBH", "B000Z27H8Q", "B000291Q3O", "B000TD0PHG", "B00023B1WQ", "1451659202", "1451659229", "B002E58FTC", "B000F8O2MO", "B000H6SY28", "B00FM4S7P4", "B00274SIVK", "B000A0GOP0", "B001DMVZKI", "B004ES6TBS", "B000MQ4WMY", "B009GGWW3W", "B0000V4906", "B00005JO3P", "B000B5XOUM", "B0007TKG76", "B002E58FU6", "B005E7SEOI", "B003CNQPMY", "B000E3L7EQ", "B0007KTBJO", "B000CELOV8", "B002E58FUG", "B0028S110A", "B000ASDFIQ", "B00JHH1VUU", "B00GOC74I4", "B002OOWKVM", "B000B8I9ZY", "B000NTMA1U", "B0014FAIYS", "B000TXPXCS", "B0054602ZI", "B001N26GSE", "B000AJJNJK", "B00GOC74QG", "B000EBGFQI", "B000C1VBAA", "B003JHXS5A", "B002OOWKYE", "B000M343AS", "B000AL733G", "B0011FLGYM", "B0007WFXL2", "B0006TPE1U", "B000UX6TKM", "B00H4ZEJ6K", "B001O4KBNM", "B000E3L7FK", "B0031XYLR6", "B0002Y4T7O", "B002ACKBTG", "B000VS6R30", "B000FA57U8", "B00H8KC1N4", "B00008EY6N", "B00IXPWGIS", "B000BYRCF6", "B008VNI9TC", "B00A2L1CJK"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLIC", "B000BOH8YQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JLIC", "B000BOH8YQ", "B006363QHE", "B000EXDS02"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 26138}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.25, "brand": "20TH CENTURY FOX HOME ENTMNT", "asin": "B00096S480", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510AE11R2PL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Mary Tyler Moore Show - The Complete Second Season (1971)"}

We've had running water for over 10 years, an underground tunnel that links us to Peru, and we invented the cat,\" narrates Tom Baker gleefully at the beginning ofLittle Britain, introducing the first hit show for fledgling digital channel BBC3 and the best new British comedy sinceThe League of Gentlemen.Read ourinterviewwith Lucas and Walliams.In fact, creators and stars Matt Lucas and David Walliams acknowledge a large debt to the League, not only in the gallery of grotesques all performed by the duo, but also in the way in which the familiar sketch-show format is expanded by clever use of locale: not Royston Vasey here, but \"Britain\" itself in all its perverse splendor: from Darkly Noon, where chavette Vicky Pollard seems all too frighteningly real (\"Yeah, but no, but yeah. Shut up!\"), to the Welsh village with only one gay, to the council estate where buck-toothed Lou looks after apparently wheelchair-bound Andy (\"Yeah, I know\"), to Kelsey Grammar School where pupils are baffled and confused by their fusty teacher, and many more besides. It's unashamedly puerile stuff and, as withThe Fast Showbefore it, many sketches rely on a single incident or catchphrase repeated over and over in only slightly different contexts. But it works brilliantly, thanks to the characterizations of Lucas and Walliams, their sharp eye for the eccentricities of modern life, and of course that surreal voiceover from Tom Baker.

{"description": "In 1952 Superman flew right into the hearts and minds of the American TV audience faster than a speeding bullet. Though most people were already familiar with man of steel through his comic books, as well as the popular radio show, it was the new medium'sAdventures of Supermanthat transformed our resident Kryptonian into a timeless icon. For many young baby boomers, Superman was the ultimate symbol of truth, justice and the American way. After watching this nostalgic trip back in time it is easy to see why: George Reeves. Reeves is the quintessential Superman. He is kind, confident, smart, always does the right thing and can literally do anything physically.  Even Reeves' Clark Kent is cool, even cocky without any of the trademarked shy, clumsy and hickish traits the character has developed over the years. And then there's Phyllis Coates as the Lois Lane. Coates portrayal of Lois is surprisingly one of the stronger female roles in '50s television.  She is one tough cookie able to stand her ground against criminals, fight off bad guys and is not afraid to outwardly express herself. Sadly, Phyllis Coates would be replaced by Noel Neill in subsequent seasons.Adventures of Supermanalso stands the test of time well as one of the best shows from the early days of television. A lot of it has to do with how the writers, producers and actors approached the making of the show.  This first season, as well as the second, were made as if they were making a serious show suitable for kids and adults. Instead of being a kids' comic book show, the episodes have a strong \"mini-serial-crime-movie\" feel, are very story driven and include loads of elements from the popular film noir style of the 1950s. This is evident in such classic episodes such as the season opener \"Superman on Earth,\" \"The Stolen Costume\" where Superman has his costume stolen by a burglar, and the tense horror-noir \"The Haunted Lighthouse.\" Also included on this DVD set is the 1951 theatrical releaseSuperman and The Mole Menwhich later became the televised two-part episode \"The Unknown People.\" --Rob Bracco", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BT96FA", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B000HWZ4E8", "B000I8OM94", "B000AQOHNA", "B00LT1JHLW", "B001OD8E4G", "B000FO0AHY", "B004BBHVIS", "B000OPODNQ", "B00BBXSPCK", "6305943389", "B0007G89FU", "B00BBXSPES", "B001DJ7Q0E", "B00080ZG2O", "B000BT96EG", "B000EU1Q2M", "B00AKK6MD4", "B00G7QPX6C", "B004EXWGJW", "B00005LOUK", "B002K0WBDM", "B00DX88IL4", "B000KWZ7JC", "B00HFWETQW", "0445040548", "B00082ZROO", "B000P6XQ50", "B00HMOWA0A", "B001DJLD2G", "B00004Y2QO", "B00IF0KAYS", "B002KVSJ6O", "B002F3BPWW", "B00080ZG2E", "B0001ZMWYG", "B001992NXI", "B0006Z2KZ2", "B000EHQTZO", "B00C7QD8MC", "B0025Y3SZS", "B001JFKWE4", "B00801OMDM", "B000BGR1B4", "B0012EI8BQ", "B001D2WUCA", "B000ION23U", "B000BF0C8E", "B001CDFY5U", "B00BDZV4PQ", "B009M4KT3I", "B000BZISS0", "B00KH57U60", "B00DXLO0BI", "B0000648YD", "B00308B170", "B00KUS5YGC", "B0002F6BJW", "B000IJ79UW", "B000IJ79X4", "B000HWZ4BG", "B000IJ79VQ", "B0047XGYRO", "B004PQM81E", "B0002W4SPO", "B000N6UF10", "B00ESFUED6", "B000RO9PTQ", "B0002NRRRE", "B00E96AY20", "B00HMOW9YM", "B005TZFYWA", "B001SGN1JM", "B000051SH3", "B00005UWA8", "B000OPODNG", "B00DZP1C0O", "B000X07SQ6", "B00JPUUSEE", "B000F9SUP8", "B00DGNFMNS", "B00DGNFMJW", "B00D3DJH7S", "B000LXGXY8", "B00005JO3P", "B000K7VHYG", "B0057Q8QO4", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B00HETMEZE", "B00BPDBEO2", "B000EBGE9G", "B005ZKCG3E", "B000W8OM68", "B00062IYW8", "B00KHA88PC", "B0041KKBJK", "B000LV6W00", "B00005JM5Z", "B006WN5W5M"], "bought_together": ["B000BT96FA", "B000EU1Q3Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000HWZ4GQ", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B000HWZ4E8", "B000BT96FA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 19626}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 11.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000A5046K", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61KExWvkZML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Adventures of Superman: Season 1"}
{"description": "How do we loveRaymond's fourth season? Let us count the classic episodes: \"The Tenth Anniversary,\" in which Debra discovers that Raymond taped over their wedding video with the 1991 Super Bowl; \"The Boob Job,\" in which Debra surprises Raymond with an apparent uplifting enhancement; \"Debra's Workout,\" which leaves her in an amorously aggressive mood; \"No Thanks,\" in which Debra tries a new, \"nice\" approach to win Marie (Doris Roberts) over;  \"Debra Makes Something Good,\" in which Debra's braciole upsets the family balance; and the Emmy-nominated \"Bad Moon Rising,\" in which Raymond desperately tries to deal with Debra's volatile mood swings. Yes, it was a career year for Patricia Heaton, who became the first cast member to be honored with an Emmy (each of the core ensemble was nominated). As with the first three seasons, season 4 concludes with a flashback episode, \"Robert's Divorce.\" But for the first time, the episode is capped with a cliffhanger, as Robert (Brad Garrett) retrieves his ex-wife's discarded phone number after running into her at a restaurant.Series star and co-creator Ray Romano once toldEntertainment WeeklythatRaymond's best episodes start with \"a small relatable concept and go somewhere bigger and deeper.\" Among the season's most memorable episodes that follow this formula are \"The Can Opener,\" in which the entire Barone family becomes embroiled in Raymond and Debra's senseless argument; the Emmy-nominated \"The Christmas Picture,\" in which Marie threatens to sit out a family photograph once she learns that Debra's parents are to be included; and the one in which Raymond discovers that Debra enjoys a good cry during her \"Alone Time.\" (\"Do you cry because I'm stupid?\" he asks. \"No,\" she replies, \"I eat ice cream because you're stupid.\"). And all parents whose children came of age during thePok&eacute;moncraze will identify with Raymond's desperate attempts to scrounge up a valuable card for his daughter in the episode, \"Hackidu.\" To quote the old comedy maxim: It's funny because it's true. And it's the universal truths and minutiae about family and married life that are at the heart ofRaymond'senduring success.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007R4SWC", "B000BNTM46", "B004D2GMVM", "B006MFQ4DE", "B000T22PVG", "B0001ZMWXW", "B000GRUMQY", "B000N8UXTW", "B00CJ7Y1CK", "B0009E27DA", "B000957O8C", "B0000CGNEC", "B00070HK4C", "B0001BS3IY", "B000AJJNIQ", "B000RGULLA", "B000EYK4H6", "B000I2J6W8", "B00DVOA1AG", "B000FBH3WC", "B000GRU09S", "B009LDD1X0", "B000B8I9ZY", "B000EBGFQI", "B0007US79Y", "B001DZOCVO", "B000I2J6VE", "B00KYCA4QY", "B0006Q93AQ", "B0007OCG74", "B000K4X5QM", "B00005JLEX", "B00G4SF9NA", "B000NJISIY", "B001P9N9B2", "B002WN8IR0", "B000TGJ82G", "B0007KTBJO", "B0002W4SWW", "B000BYRCF6", "B000NA1W3Q", "B005D0OHA6", "B0001NBNJ8", "B0006ZM8M2", "B000QUEQ6I", "B0000B1A5A", "B0002W4SX6", "B00465I13S", "B004MWLXTY", "B000B8384G", "B000C1VBAA", "B000QFCDAY", "B0096RC57O", "B008L0YN6I", "B000KGGIL4", "B000640WGM", "B0024F08TW", "B0002WZTLQ", "B005DCJ0Q0", "B000YKYT1M", "B000E3L7EQ", "B000NJISJ8", "B0001907BW", "B009LDD3I8", "B000W91RUG", "B004WO9OMA", "B001JAHSKU", "B00I099K4U", "B000QUTTPG", "B000LV6VZ6", "B002AMVEEM", "B000A0GOQY", "B005BUA1GC", "B0013D8M3U", "B008LCRABQ", "B00BB8LU5Y", "B00GOC75YW", "B00A33J8FM", "B00005JOHC", "B0001Z3I1C", "B0011N19HI", "B00009Y3RW", "B004B93RHY", "B000HWZ4IE", "B001FSKE84", "B005MQ58OU", "B0001NBNIY", "B000062XFG", "B005IA9JQ8", "B002E58FTW", "B0019D151K", "B003VTKZ84", "B000MGBSH6", "B0015XWU9A", "B0006IUDYY", "B00GLPYVT4"], "bought_together": ["B0007R4SWC", "B000BNTM46"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007R4SWC", "B004D2GMVM", "B0001ZMWXW", "B000BNTM46"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 29001}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 18.69, "brand": "HBO HOME VIDEO", "asin": "B000A7PKGW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51UUyuQccyL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Everybody Loves Raymond: Season 4"}

{"description": "In its second season,Miami Vicewalks that fine line between hip and cool. Hip fades, but cool is timeless. Then, as now, it doesn't get much cooler than this groundbreaking and trendsetting series' promise of a \"life of adventure, exciting folks, and exotic locales,\" to quote one sardonic character. But the compelling stories, cinematic trappings, and lightning-in-a-bottle chemistry between costars Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas elevateMiami Vicefrom time capsule status. Likewise, the eclectic soundtrack, that would be painfully dated had it been stuck in the '80s, is a mind-blowing shuffle of genres and mainstream, alternative and world artists. \"Prodigal Son,\" the double-length episode that opens the season, features Glenn Frey, U2, the Neville Brothers, Debbie Harry, Brian Ferry, Lou Reed, Traffic, and Phil Collins. Collins himself portrays a con man in one of the season's most entertaining episodes, \"Phil the Shill.\" Not content to just be heard, other musicians who generally eschewed television, appeared onMiami Vicethis season, adding to the series' considerable cachet. Among them: Kiss frontman Gene Simmons (\"Prodigal Son\"); Miles Davis (\"Junk Love\"); Leonard Cohen (\"French Twist\"); Ted Nugent (\"Definitely Miami\"); and Frank Zappa (\"Payback\").Miami Viceinstantly established itself as an oasis for character actors, many at the beginning of their careers. The second season offers early glimpses of Nathan Lane (\"Buddies\"), Harvey Fierstein and a pre-SeinfeldMichael Richards as a menacing heavy (\"The Fix\"), David Strathairn (\"Out Where the Buses Don't Run\"), Bob Balaban (\"Back in the World\"), and John Leguizamo (\"Sons and Lovers,\" which also features the unfortunate stunt-casting of Lee Iacocca as a gun-toting parks commissioner).Most ofMiami Vice's buzz-generating episodes were in season 1, but season 2 offers several series benchmarks. Two of Johnson's finest hours are \"Back in the World\" (which he directed) and \"Buddies,\" two episodes that explore Crockett's Vietnam War experience. Thomas got his chance to shine in \"Prodigal Son\" and \"Sons and Lovers,\" in which Tubbs becomes a target of the vengeful Ivan Calderon. \"Bushido\" is an always-welcome showcase for Emmy-winner Edward James Olmos as Castillo, who helps shield an associate's Soviet wife and son from the CIA and KGB. \"Out Where the Buses Don't Run\" boasts an Emmy-worthy performance by guest star Bruce McGill (D-Day inAnimal House) as an unhinged former vice cop.Miami Vicestylishly subverted TV cop drama convention, but despite one too many downbeat endings that freeze on a devastated Crockett, it remains exhilarating to re-visit. There are no extras on this three disc-set, but the episodes are enough to make you want to party like it's 1985.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JLEY", "B000MLWQ6S", "B000MLWQ6I", "B000OVLMKC", "B00ID3TPA2", "B001BN4WK4", "B000002O4W", "B001MVWLYY", "B001G0MFQ0", "B000FVBLBQ", "B004UV3KSO", "B000002O54", "0790742020", "B00023GGAI", "B000BGR1B4", "B00005JMHI", "B000N2HD6O", "B000XJD3K2", "B00HUPC5QU", "B000LXGXY8", "B001JFKWE4", "B000BF0C8E", "B000E5KQLY", "B000BUE5D2", "B000E5KQM8", "B0007LXP86", "B001B7CNXI", "B00DYQ1G78", "B000BUE5CI", "B003XMKU3Y", "B00018D3RI", "B0009ZE9Y4", "B00066FBQQ", "B00HZMZ286", "B000TZX5XK", "B0047BXR8U", "B000CRR3NI", "B0007LXP7W", "B000GEIRVY", "B00008ZL4Q", "B000E5KQMI", "B000M9BPGC", "B000G75ARU", "B00E9EFBES", "B0007XBMA2", "B00113ALL8", "B000XJD3JS", "B000063JZO", "B002LFQIL2", "B000BUE5DC", "B000J4QWMC", "B0047BXR9E", "B000T28PU6", "B000UX6TPC", "B00DGNFMJW", "B001J0FVYK", "B003XMKU0M", "B0024FAD7Y", "B00I86MQF0", "B00116GEEI", "B000CELOV8", "B00CQAVIZS", "B003QS0E54", "B00DGNFMMY", "B0009S4IM4", "B00116GEES", "B000059H7O", "B003INBNV6", "B00133QNRW", "B00FWMVVJ0", "B00369ERC4", "B0047BXR30", "B001DHXT7U", "B001CQONOA", "B0014FAIXE", "B000FFJYBQ", "B0009UC80G", "B000TGURZ8", "B0007A0F4Y", "B000B8I9ZO", "B000HXDWG4", "B0019GNX4O", "B007KW5M6I", "B006JN86V2", "B0007PAM0G", "B000UX6TPM", "B0009YCLBS", "B001FFBI9G", "B000GRU09I", "B00AQ590DM", "B000ATQYWY", "B001J2XROY", "B0012EBV8I", "B003IRUFB6", "B0007XG26G", "B002JIOOAS", "B000LC4C60", "B003D8M0NG", "B0002NY8R6", "B008X8U83K"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLEY", "B000MLWQ6S"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JLEY", "B000MLWQ6S", "B000MLWQ6I", "B000OVLMKC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9988}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 23.13, "brand": "JOHNSON,DON", "asin": "B000BKVKSA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QFY3CH5SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Miami Vice: Season 2"}
{"description": "Adventures of Superman - The Complete Second Seasonpretty much follows the formula laid out in the first season, building on what made the groundbreaking show so popular. For many fans, season two is the best of the series and it is easy to see why. Each episode has that strong \"mini-serial-crime-movie\" feel and was again scripted and shot to appeal to adults as well as younger audiences. This would all change once season three, the first color Superman season, rolled around and the producers would strictly tailor the show for children. The biggest difference viewers will notice in this season is the new Lois Lane. Fans had to say goodbye to the wonderfully tough Phyllis Coates, replaced by the perkier Noel Neill who would play the sassy and smart journalist for seasons to come.  For many young girls growing up in the 1950s Noel Neill's Lois Lane, the first liberated woman presented to the TV audience in the children's market, was the ultimate role model. Highlights of season two include \"Panic in the sky\" (the episode many feel is the series best--where Superman saves Metropolis from an asteroid that also erases his memory), \"Semi-Private Eye\" (where Jimmy Olsen poses as a private eye to stalk the bad guys), and \"The Defeat of Superman\" (where Superman loses his powers thanks to a dose of Kryptonite).--Rob Bracco", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EU1Q3Q", "B000A5046K", "B000HWZ4E8", "B000I8OM94", "B000AQOHNA", "B00LT1JHLW", "B00HFWETQW", "B00AKK6MD4", "B00BBXSPCK", "B004BBHVIS", "B00BBXSPES", "B001OD8E4G", "B000OPODNQ", "B00G7QPX6C", "B004EXWGJW", "B000EU1Q2M", "B0007G89FU", "B002K0WBDM", "B00080ZG2O", "B00HMOWA0A", "B001DJ7Q0E", "B00DX88IL4", "B000FO0AHY", "B000BT96EG", "6305943389", "B000KWZ7JC", "B0063DOV2Q", "B00IF0KAYS", "B00HMOW9YM", "B000ION23U", "B00KUS5YGC", "B005G5NPD8", "B00IYRLUEG", "B00005LOUK", "0445040548", "B000HWZ4BG", "B000IJ79XE", "B000IJ79X4", "B0025Y3SZS", "B00DXLO0BI", "B002JODUES", "B001992NXI", "B000BF0C8E", "B000B7HZUK", "B0030Y12BE", "B000R206FK", "B00005UWA8", "B00005JM5Z", "B005NHZAXM", "B001JFKWE4", "B004IB04S0", "B000P6XQ50", "B00E96AY20", "B000TSTEMS", "B000J10EQU", "3836535769", "B00ESFUED6", "B0018BDDFE", "B00CM0DIT6", "B0002IQKAY", "B00198X0YK", "B005TZFYWA", "B00DVKKWFE", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B009M4KT3I", "B00IZ27GD4", "B000IJ79UW", "B006WN5W5M", "B0062KMDWU", "B0001ZMWYG", "B0011NVC9S", "B000RO9PTQ", "B000P296AS", "B001GMH8WE", "B00DYQ1GBE", "B000LC4ZIA", "B000EQ5PTQ", "B000FI9OEK", "B0041SI7B6", "B001CDFY5U", "B0006Z2KZ2", "B000UX6TJ8", "B00HETMEZE", "B0016MOWOQ", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B00E96AWY0", "B001DZOCZU", "B00IS6WPT2", "B000RZIGTA", "B002VA59ZS", "B000N6UF10", "B00G9W7N6W", "B00DXLO0D6", "B00A92MBIS", "B001JAHQQ6", "B000EHQTZO", "B00009ATIM", "B000LXGXY8", "B000LV6W00", "B00IED43X0"], "bought_together": ["B000EU1Q3Q", "B000A5046K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000A5046K", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B000HWZ4E8", "B000HWZ4GQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22465}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 11.99, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B000BT96FA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KJekzBirL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Adventures of Superman: Season 2"}
{"description": "Angel - Season OneHe's hunky, he's brooding, he's a do-gooder, and he was Buffy's first boyfriend. Angel, the tortured vampire destined to walk the earth with a soul, got his own series after three seasons onBuffy the Vampire Slayerand did what any new star might do: he moved to L.A. (the City of Angels--get it?) and set up shop. Angel (co-created byBuffymastermind Joss Whedon) finds the titular vampire (David Boreanaz) as a kind of supernatural private investigator, fighting evil one case at a time and, like his ex-girlfriend, keeping the world from getting destroyed by vengeful demons and such. This first season features guest appearances by variousBuffycharacters, including werewolf boy Oz (Seth Green), rogue slayer Faith (Eliza Dushku), deliciously evil vamp Darla (Julie Benz), and Buffy herself (Sarah Michelle Gellar), all of whom helped get the show off and running in style.Angel - Season TwoThe second season ofAngel, saw the cult vampire show finally stand on its own fromBuffy the Vampire Slayer, assembling all the members of the show's core cast, transferring the action to a fashionably run-down L.A. hotel, and bringing in a few Buffy characters from Angel's history to further establish the moody vampire's own mythology. Moving their Angel Investigations to posher digs, Angel (David Boreanaz), Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter), and Wesley (Alexis Denisof) were soon joined by street fighter (J. August Richards)&#x96;-and by street fighter, of course we meandemonstreet fighter. But just as this group was solidifying, up popped Angel's old love, Darla (the fantastic Julie Benz), freshly arrived in L.A. from a hell dimension&#x85; just in time to be turned into a vampire again by her old cohort, Drusilla (Juliet Landau), and lure Angel into abandoning his newly formed team.Angel - Season ThreeIn the third season ofAngel, the titular vampire with a soul was forced to stand alone thanks to the (temporary) death of his beloved Buffy and her show's move to a new network, with no crossover between the two allowed. He returns from seeking peace in a demon-haunted monastery to find the L.A. Angel Investigations team fighting supernatural crime in his absence. Fred is still haunted by the nightmare dimension from which they rescued her; Cordelia's visions get ever more painful and debilitating. The schemes of the evil law firm Wolfram and Hart become every more imaginative and dragon lady Lilah Morgan becomes even more of an enemy when lusting after Angel. Unbelievably, Darla, Angel's vampire sire and lover, turns up, pregnant with his child and is tortured by inexplicable motherly feelings as well as a raging thirst for human blood.Angel - Season FourAs the fourth season ofAngel, starts, everything is still as we left it: Angel has been sunk to the bottom of the sea in an iron box by his inexplicable and vindictive son Connor and Cordelia has been summoned to higher realms to await orders. Gunn and Fred are left in the Hyperion Hotel, unsure about what has happened to their friends, and Lilah is working hard to seduce Wesley to the dark side. In the first few episodes, some of this is resolved but it's almost immediately replaced by far worse crises: prophesies of doom accumulate more rapidly even than usual in this wonderfully gloomy show and a horned rock-like beast rains fire on Los Angeles. This last year isAngel&#x92;s most tightly dramatic season yet--with a story arc of surprising intensity punctuated by the show's usual wit and sexiness.Angel - Season FiveLives were upended--and some co-opted--in the fifth and final season ofAngel, as the denizens of Angel Investigations found themselves taking on one of their scariest endeavors ever: corporate life. After making a literal deal with the devil (or something distinctly devil-like), Angel (David Boreanaz) moved his team from their crumbling hotel to the high-rise digs of law-firm-from-hell Wolfram & Hart, his reasoning being they could better fight the forces of evil from the inside, and with more resources to boot. Clever maneuvering or easy rationalization? Not a few members of Angel's team accused him of selling out (as did a number of viewers), but as with most of the show's previous four seasons,Angelsomehow took a dubious premise and mined it for gold. And with one core cast member gone (Charisma Carpenter, whose Cordelia was immersed in a deep coma), it seemed as if the show, from within and without, would suddenly fall apart--that is, until Angel's longtime nemesis Spike (James Marsters) showed up, fresh from his sacrificial roasting at the series finale ofBuffy the Vampire Slayer.

{"description": "A sterling cast and vivid direction giveNorth Countryan emotional heft to match its political convictions. Charlize Theron (Monster) plays Josey Aimes, who goes to work at a Minnesota steel mine after splitting with her violent husband.Frances McDormand and CharlizeTheron inNorth Country.But the job proves to be almost as harrowing as her marriage; the male miners, resentful of women taking jobs, verbally abuse and play humiliating pranks on the female miners. After being physically assaulted by a coworker, Josey tries to fight against the harassment, but none of the other women will join her case for fear that things will only get worse.North Country, directed by Niki Caro (Whale Rider), makes the women's experience palpable for the audience without overdoing it. But the lawsuit is only part of the movie; the gut impact ofNorth Countrycomes from the devastating effect the lawsuit has on Josey's family, friends, and coworkers--thanks to an incredible ensemble cast that includes Sissy Spacek (In the Bedroom), Sean Bean (Lord of the Rings), Richard Jenkins (Six Feet Under), Woody Harrelson (The People vs. Larry Flynt), and the always powerful Frances McDormand (Fargo,Mississippi Burning). The courtroom histrionics don't always ring true, but the family conflict is riveting and deeply moving.

{"description": "The affable crew of WNYX is at it again in this painfully underseen sitcom. The 1996-97 season is more outlandish and escapes the clich&#xE9;s of the secret romance between reporter Lisa (Maura Tierney) and news director Dave (Dave Foley), the most continuous storyline of the first two seasons. Many of the season's episodes deal with the normalcy of the office environment: performance reviews, the complaint box, budget cuts, the annual Halloween party, and office feuds, most involving the wonderfully smug anchor Bill McNeal (Phil Hartman in what should have been his signature role) and daffy reporter Matthew (Andy Dick, certainly his signature role). However,NewsRadiocreator Paul Simms and the writers push the envelope, including placing Bill in a mental ward (meeting patient Jon Lovitz who would fill in for Hartman later), Dave's obsession with an arcade game, Matt's compulsion with his \"twin\" brother (played by Jon Stewart), and eclectic owner Jimmy James's (Andy Root) brief run for the presidency. The fantasy elements kick in with an episode on daydreaming on an extremely hot day, one in which Jimmy falls into a coma, and an episode that takes place in space! At times, those odd elements don't work and there's not enough moments for Khandi Alexander (as Bill's on-air partner). But make no mistake, the show boasts some of the best moments in '90s sitcom-dom. Perhaps the highlight show has Dave and Bill stuck in a St. Louis airport (and swarmed by Midwest manners, to Bill's chagrin) while Lisa runs the station. Season 3 guest stars include Ben Stiller as a health club jerk, Norm McDonald as Jimmy's lawyer, and James Caan as himself wanting to learn for a role shadowing Bill (but ending up marveling how odd Matthew is). Jerry Seinfeld also stars as himself in a surprisingly unfunny episode, proving good comedies shouldn't have to stoop to stunt casting.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FBH3WW", "B0000ZMH8S", "B000MGTQ6Q", "B001MVYUSO", "B0001Z3I0S", "B007C8RZXS", "B007C8RZR4", "B0058EE6O4", "B0058EE6NK", "B00A2XQU7M", "B00A2XQTVY", "B001O4KBO6", "B00KNVF3US", "B001D2WUDE", "B00014K5BO", "B000MGBLFK", "B0025KVNOU", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B004J713LA", "B00GOC74QG", "B00008J2EB", "B005ZVIMUE", "B002JYPVR2", "B00005JLIB", "B000SQFC0O", "B00A33J8FM", "B0025VKX04", "B002TQKL1Q", "B0025KVTLW", "B00006ADFR", "B000GPIPTM", "B0001BS3IY", "B001TKJDNA", "B00GHH9HW2", "B0001NBNIY", "B0006IUDYY", "B000957O8C", "B000Y7U9AK", "B000EQ45BU", "B00IFK7ONI", "B000A7Q1YC", "B004D2GMVM", "B001993YB8", "B0006N2EZK", "B003L77GJM", "B000BNTM46", "B001P9N9B2", "B0002W4P98", "B000MXPE6U", "B003XL6EI0", "B000YKYT1M", "B0006N2EZA", "B00JDCP0QA", "B0030U1TCK", "B000BOH8YQ", "B000A0GOQ4", "B000FTC1GW", "B00005JLEX", "B002OOWL3E", "B001WG761C", "B000BC8T1E", "B00DD56724", "B0007R4SWC", "B0002NY8R6", "B00GTZWUPS", "B0089BSMDY", "B005M5OS6K", "B000ERVJMM", "B00070HK4C", "B002OOWL3Y", "B000KX0IPO", "B007PK8686", "B000MX7V5C", "B000EXDRZI", "B00BB8LU5Y", "B000A9QKSM", "B000EHSVDC", "B0007CILMK", "B00GTZWZH6", "B003R4ZMSQ", "B005BUA1GC", "B001PJRAVM", "B0006Q93BU", "B007KFZ87S", "B007KFZ88M", "B000QFCDAO", "B000YI99IW", "B004MWLXTY", "B0053O89JM", "B00009VRF0", "B008LCRA98", "B000HIVIOC", "B0011N19HI", "B0081QF6QS", "B00022FWEU", "B0000AQS81", "B0038M2AQE", "B00A2L1CKO", "B001UHN88I", "B004WO9OMA"], "bought_together": ["B000FBH3WW", "B0000ZMH8S"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000ZMH8S", "B000FBH3WW", "B001DSNEM4", "B000MGTQ6Q"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 28176}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 10.59, "brand": "Columbia Tri Star", "asin": "B000DZ854A", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cbuc-rHDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Newsradio - The Complete Third Season"}
{"description": "The Busby Berkeley Collectioncelebrates the work of one of the most visually inventive director-choreographers in the history of film.  The centerpiece is of course42nd Street(1933).   This is the quintessential backstage musical in which young Peggy Sawyer (Ruby Keeler) goes from wide-eyed chorus girl to leading lady, urged by Warner Baxter, \"You're going out there a youngster, but you'vegotto come back a star!\"  A cast that also includes Dick Powell and Ginger Rogers (when she was an RKO contract player and before she teamed up with Fred Astaire) performs \"Shuffle Off to Buffalo, \" \"You're Getting to Be a Habit with Me,\" and the title tune, in which Keeler tap-dances on a black surface that turns out to be the roof of a car.  Berkeley's numbers are known for their kaleidoscopic patterns, their stark black-and-white contrast, and their sheer sense of spectacle.  But more than anything, they're known for their celebration of women.  By the dozens, they dance, play pianos, frolic in waterfalls, and, in some of the most overtly sexual numbers, stand spread-eagled in a line as the camera passes through their legs.  In many ways, the title song fromDamessums it up best: \"What do you go for / to see a show for? / Tell the truth, you go to see those beautiful dames.\"While Berkeley choreographed and directed the musical sequences in these films, the plot sections were generally directed by others such as Lloyd Bacon.  Keeler and Powell were the most frequent headliners, supported by character players such as Joan Blondell, Guy Kibbee, and Ned Sparks, and most of the songs were contributed by Harry Warren and Al Dubin.  The stories aren't much, usually revolving around the putting-together of a musical show as well as the lives and loves of chorus girls.  The term \"gold diggers,\" which is the source of the title of two of the films included in this set, refers unflatteringly to chorus girls in search of wealthy husbands.Gold Diggers of 1933opens with a justly famous shot of Ginger Rogers wearing an outfit of coins and singing \"We're in the Money\" first in English then in pig Latin.Gold Diggers of 1935is capped by \"The Lullaby of Broadway,\" a 14-minute story-within-a-story that seems one of the inspirations forSingin' in the Rain's \"Broadway Melody.\"Dames(1934) has the aforementioned title tune as well as \"I Only Have Eyes for You\" (with Powell singing to dozens of Keeler faces).Footlight Paradechanges things up a bit by starring James Cagney as a producer desperately cranking out musical numbers. Keeler and Powell emerge from their bit-character roles to headline two of the big productions stacked together at the end, while Cagney replaces Powell in the third, showing off the vaudeville hoofing skills he would use later in 1942'sYankee Doodle Dandy.DVD supplements are generous.  The sixth disc is the 163-minuteBusby Berkely Disc, a former laserdisc program that collects just the musical numbers from nine films without the plot filler.  Most of the numbers are already included in the films in this collection, but there are also one number each fromFashions of 1934,Wonder Bar,In Caliente, andGold Diggers of 1937.  Also on the discs are new and old featurettes (one tracks the development of42nd Streetfrom book to screen to stage), and vintage cartoons and shorts (one promotional short has Berkeley on-screen talking upDames).  Picture quality is about the same as on theAstaire and Rogers Collection, Vol. 1: good for the age of the material, but with noticeable fuzz and print damage.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001A5ES8E", "B000FPDD86", "B000YRY7VC", "B000I2JDF8", "B00012FXJ0", "B000EBD9SK", "B00406UJZG", "B001OSC4G0", "B001QFFBAM", "B0047BXR1C", "B0017I79BW", "B008JEJROE", "B000E6ESWG", "B00004TVUD", "B001D7T44C", "B004132I3O", "B00K6D1S7A", "B0012GVMIK", "B004132I6Q", "B0009S4IJM", "B00CLF822A", "B0007939MK", "B0001DCYUK", "B000E6ESXK", "B0007TKNJ2", "B00004VVMZ", "B00C68SHOK", "B000EBGE5U", "B005F265FW", "B005F265IE", "B00406UJWE", "B0000UX4V2", "B005ND87UY", "B00008AOWK", "B00FNRA1D6", "B0001FR54S", "B0024FAG1C", "B000E8JO32", "B002TOL4EQ", "B0009S4IKG", "B00114XLUA", "B000EBD9RG", "B00K2CHVSK", "B0090XPGUM", "B0017IAIGU", "B000A0GOEQ", "B0007TKNKQ", "B00J70UXEM", "B00DVPMYWI", "B006TTC5A4", "B009RNK10K", "B00114XLTQ", "B0011FDVEK", "B00AATGDY8", "B00I04SVV8", "B0012GVMI0", "B00KIZY3XW", "B003552QUE", "B0007Z0O9U", "B000ZM1MJG", "B00005JKS8", "B008JEJSH0", "B0029712X6", "B00D9BNOKK", "B0006H32DY", "0199925674", "B00KGLS050", "B003G9IT3C", "B005ZVILV4", "B001BSBBDK", "B0024FAG6W", "B000F7CMRC", "B00007CVS4", "B000EU1Q22", "B0012GVMIA", "B0009S4IJW", "B003UN2IAY", "B00114XLUU", "B0090XK9FO", "B00B27WTBI", "B000PC8AL4", "0312284314", "B001ASQ9OC", "B000BNTMAA", "B003NNGBLS", "B00ITZXDDY", "B000CEV3L4", "B0009S4IKQ", "B0001LJCRA", "B004H83IFU", "B000PAAK5A", "B004T4XRDU", "B00EO2I6RO", "B003BWN542", "B003ZYU3TG", "B0002MHE1O", "B00IVLRC88", "0810944758", "B0012GVMIU", "B000N3T0FK"], "bought_together": ["B001A5ES8E", "B000FPDD86"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004132I6Q", "B00406UJWE", "B000FPDD86", "B001A5ES8E"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 36381}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 29.9, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000E0OE1M", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518gwH7Ax9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Busby Berkeley Collection (Footlight Parade / Gold Diggers of 1933 / Dames / Gold Diggers of 1935 / 42nd Street)"}
{"description": "Rent, the show that in 1996 gave voice to a Broadway generation, has finally become an energetic, passionate, and touching movie musical. Based loosely on Puccini'sLa Boh&#xE8;me, it focuses on the year in the life of a group of friends in New York's East Village--\"bohemians\" who live carefree lives of art, music, sex, and drugs. Well, carefree until Mark, an aspiring filmmaker (Anthony Rapp), and Roger, an aspiring songwriter (Adam Pascal), find out they owe a year's rent to Benny (Taye Diggs), a former friend who had promised them free residence when he married the landlord's daughter. Roger has also attracted the attention of his downstairs neighbor, Mimi (Rosario Dawson), while Mark's former girlfriend, Maureen (Idina Menzel), has found a new romance in a lawyer named Joanne (Tracie Thoms). Philosophy professor Tom (Jesse L. Martin) finds his soul mate in drag queen Angel (Wilson Jermaine Heredia). But because this is the late-'80s, the threat of AIDS is always present.The remarkable thing aboutRentthe movie is that nearly 10 years after the show debuted onBroadway, six of the eight principals return in the roles they originated. They're a bit older than would be ideal for their characters, but they do have the advantage of having learned the show directly from creator Jonathan Larson (who died of an aortic aneurysm while the show was in previews), plus they started young--we're not exactly talking Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford here.  Alongside a polished performance like Rapp's--sometimes observer-commentator, sometimes participant in two of the score's showstoppers, \"The Tango Maureen\" and \"La Vie Boheme\"--the two new additions (Thoms in place of Fredi Walker, Dawson in place of the edgier Daphne Rubin-Vega) slip comfortably into the ensemble; the pivotal Dawson makes a seductive case as Mimi when she tempts Roger in the mesmerizing \"Light My Candle\" or burns up the stage of the Catscratch Club in \"Out Tonight.\"  Moviegoers who have an aversion to people who break into song while walking down the street probably won't have their minds changed byRent(even if they are singingrocksongs), and the gritty subject matter and lack of big-name stars make it unlikely to cross over to general audiences the wayChicagodid.  But fans of musicals should find \"Seasons of Love\" as stirring as ever, and the show's passionate admirers--the \"Rentheads\"--probably couldn't have wished for a more sympathetic director thanRentfan Chris Columbus, or a more faithful representation of the show they love.--David HoriuchiOn the DVDThree powerful musical numbers cut from the final film are the highlight of the two-disc DVD.  In the aftermath of the funeral scene, Anthony Rapp sings \"Halloween,\" and he, Adam Pascal, and Rosario Dawson share \"Goodbye Love\" (both songs were in the stage version). Then in an alternate ending, the cast finishes \"No Day But Today\" on the bare stage on which the film began.  There are worthwhile arguments for why these scenes were cut or replaced, so it's fortunate that the DVD lets us see these at all.  Those musical numbers have optional commentary by director Chris Columbus, Rapp, and Pascal (two other cut scenes have no commentary), including one funny moment in which Rapp explains in great detail the technical challenge of shooting \"Halloween\" only to have Columbus say, \"Yeah, but I don't know if that's the take we used.\"  The three also provide commentary on the film itself, with Columbus discussing various decisions, criticizing the critics, and marveling \"I still don't know how we got the PG-13,\" and Rapp and Pascal occasionally recalling differences in the stage version.The other whopper of a feature isNo Day But Today, a nearly two-hour documentary that uses video clips, still photographs, and interviews with family and friends to celebrate the short life of Jonathan Larson and his creation.  Topics include his early interest in musical theater (\"I want to write theHairfor the '90s.\"), the support of Stephen Sondheim, the impact of the AIDS epidemic, the long and difficult road ofRent(casting the show, Larson learning to collaborate, the transfer to a Broadway stage, and the Rentheads), and Larson's tragic death. The last 20 minutes covers the making of the film, director Chris Columbus, the decision to rely on most of the original cast (the only two principals who didn't appear in the movie, Daphne Rubin-Vega and Fredi Walker-Browne, are interviewed in earlier segments, but only mentioned in passing here), recording sessions, and location shooting.  If the movie ofRentwas a tribute to Jonathan Larson, the DVD is all that and more, a moving and incredibly detailed look at an extraordinary talent whom the world lost far too soon.--David HoriuchiMoreRentMovie soundtrackOriginal Broadway cast recordingAnthony Rapp'sWithout You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical \"Rent\"", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001LMAKAG", "B000AYEI4U", "B006ZZQMXS", "B000005ALT", "B004SEUJBE", "B0007TKNII", "B000077VR3", "B002D0L0R2", "0688154379", "B00AEBBAEK", "B000Z8R2VW", "B002G1K82Q", "B00GM7ZFAA", "B00JAOW3MA", "B00006D295", "B005S9EK5Y", "B0028SVXVM", "B00004XMTJ", "B001MT7ZEW", "B001GKJ2DY", "B006Z21ZFG", "6304806418", "0743269772", "B0000AM6IY", "B0000TB01Y", "B00070HK24", "B002NZK5TG", "B002ZG976U", "B00AEFY5TI", "B000EWBKMG", "B00008973A", "1423406265", "B00AEFXTKO", "B0013Z7RUC", "B00004W5VC", "B00GTO6WXU", "B000I2J6YG", "B000RPCK2E", "0800141806", "0743269764", "B00028HBIO", "0783240287", "B0007WFXZI", "0792841638", "B005QIOKBQ", "1938438175", "B005SFR7YE", "B003L77GAQ", "B001FB55OE", "B000E3LHSM", "B00001PE59", "0767827929", "B000J3OTSM", "B000UAE7NG", "B005LAIHR2", "B009NYF2GQ", "B00005JOFQ", "B002ZG99IG", "B0000VCZKM", "B00005O3VD", "B001HN69AY", "B000FIHN5M", "B0011U52E2", "B0000524E5", "B003H6Z0PO", "B006WZIB1C", "B004D9FLJE", "0061350966", "B0053O8A5K", "B001CTA1UM", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00133KFGW", "B000URDCC6", "B001LMAKAQ", "B0009JE57G", "B009LDD5E0", "B00003CYJ4", "B00001PE4D", "B005PTMPYA", "B00005OCMS", "B004VJJFDE", "B00003CXHG", "B00447L4KA", "B0002E5O9G", "B0009IOR6Q", "B001FAFO3W", "B005BUA1HQ", "B00C81AVNU", "B00004RF9K", "B00166UFSY", "B002D0L0QS", "B00AMEZDJW", "B00006RIO7", "B00FGEO7OK", "B000683VI4", "B001JV5BF8", "B00005UQ9W", "B00GB0ORJ8"], "bought_together": ["B001LMAKAG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001LMAKAG", "B000077VR3", "B004SEUIWO", "B005SFR7YE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7679}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.86, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000E1YVZU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61ZTKXS4AGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rent (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)"}

{"description": "A popular and well-regarded comedy that ran for eight seasons in the '90s,Wingswas created by David Angell, Peter Casey, and David Lee, the team that worked together onCheersand later createdFrasier.  Tim Daly and Steven Weber play two brothers, Joe and Brian Hackett, respectively, who parted ways many years ago when a woman left Joe to marry Brian.  Joe, the straitlaced do-everything-right brother, is running Sandpiper Air, a small airline on the island of Nantucket that runs commuter flights to the New England coast, when he reluctantly offers a job to Brian, the carefree brother who's also a pilot. Others who work at the airport are Helen (Crystal Bernard), the former girl-next-door who now works the lunch counter and aspires to be a professional cello player; Lowell (Thomas Haden Church), the not-all-there mechanic; Roy (David Schramm), the owner of the rival airline AeroMass; and Fay, who handles Sandpiper's front desk. Over the short (six episodes) first season, Joe and Brian develop romantic triangles over both Helen and Brian's ex-wife, Carol (Kim Johston Ulrich), and Brian tries to set up Joe with the island tramp (Megan Mullaly).  In the second season, the romantic entanglements continue, Joe develops a health problem that keeps him from flying, and we meet the last major member of the cast, Italian cab driver Antonio Scarpacci (Tony Shalhoub). Guest stars includeCheers' George Wendt and John Ratzenberger, Abraham Benrubi (ER) as Roy's son, and David Ogden Stiers as a conductor whom Helen tries to impress.  While much of the regular cast faded from view afterWings, Shalhoub and Church garnered critical acclaim for their work onMonkandSideways, respectively.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00GOC74QG", "B00IFK7ONI", "B00IFK7OFG", "B00IFK7O5G", "B000GTLB6C", "B001QU9RSE", "B000F8O2MO", "B000MX7V5C", "B00GOC74I4", "B001MVYUSO", "B000NTMA1U", "B000Z27H8Q", "B004ES6TBS", "B000YKYT1M", "B00HNGC56G", "B00GHH9HW2", "B0001Z3I0S", "B0025KVNOU", "B00LT1JHLW", "B005DCJ0Q0", "B00JDCP0QA", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B0006N2EZK", "B000A7Q1YC", "B000EOTVAM", "B000ERVJMM", "B000MGBLFK", "B001IXXYCE", "B001HUHBAY", "B0012EM5DS", "B000BF0C8E", "B0006IUDYY", "B000BGR1B4", "B006OKOWUY", "B004MWLXTY", "B000A0GOQ4", "B001D2WUDE", "B000LXGXY8", "B000N2HD6O", "B0001NBNIY", "B0007Y08JW", "B00KYCA4QY", "B0019F02W6", "B001P9N9B2", "B000MXPE6U", "B0002NY8R6", "B002OOWL3E", "B000QFCDAO", "B002PQ7JR4", "B00HRUQB5O", "B0025KVTLW", "B00K8HALVI", "B004WO9OMA", "B001JFKWE4", "B00JHH1VUU", "B00BUWD7NE", "B000B5XOTS", "B002OOWL3Y", "B005M5OS6K", "B000FTC1GW", "B00005JLIB", "B0000E32X2", "B0030U1TCK", "B00K8HAKSW", "B00DXLO0D6", "B0002W4SWW", "B00E96AWY0", "B005ZVIMUE", "B000RGULLA", "B002AMVEEM", "B006VC3LDO", "B00GLT2SOA", "B000EXDRZI", "B00008NV4G", "B000XJD3K2", "B0012EM5EC", "B000MGBSH6", "B00BM2JVAA", "B00EYA6VF0", "B000R7I3YG", "B008L0YMWS", "B00DXLO086", "B00I4581F4", "B001TKJDNA", "B0058EE6OO", "B0025VKX04", "B000ERVJMW", "B00IJZW35I", "B00GOC74RU", "B00GC2KI2U", "B00DD56724", "B00GOC75YW", "B0058EE6NK", "B001O4KBO6", "B00LU5PB0I", "B00I458456", "B001HUHBD6", "B0058EE6O4"], "bought_together": ["B00GOC74QG", "B00IFK7ONI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00GOC74QG", "B00IFK7OFG", "B00IFK7O5G", "B00IFK7ONI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 87387}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 13.5, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B000ELIZZM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5114FZGNQWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wings - The Complete First and Second Seasons"}

{"description": "The legend of Pocahontas and John Smith receives a luminous and essential retelling by maverick filmmaker Terrence Malick. The facts of Virginia's first white settlers, circa 1607, have been told for eons and fortified by Disney's animated films: explorer Smith (Colin Farrell) and the Native American princess (newcomer Q'orianka Kilcher) bond when the two cultures meet, a flashpoint of curiosity and war lapping interchangeably at the shores of the new continent. Malick, who took a twenty year break between his second and third films (Days of Heaven and The Thin Red Line), is a master of film poetry; the film washes over you, with minimal dialogue (you see characters speak on camera for less than a quarter of the film). The rest of the words are a stream-of-consciousness narration--a technique Malick has used before but never to such degree, creating a movie you feel more than watch. The film's beauty (shot in Virginia by Emmanuel Lubezki) and production design (by Jack Fisk) seems very organic, and in fact, organic is a great label for the movie as a whole, from the dreadful conditions of early Jamestown (it makes you wonder why Englishman would want to live there) to the luminescent love story. Malick is blessed with a cast that includes Wes Studi, August Schellenberg, Christopher Plummer, and Christian Bale (who, curiously, was also in the Disney production). Fourteen-year-old Kilcher, the soul of the film, is an amazing find, and Farrell, so often tagged as the next big thing, delivers his first exceptional performance since his stunning debut in Tigerland. James Horner provides a fine score, but is overshadowed by a Mozart concerto and a recurring prelude from Wagner's Das Rheingold, a scrumptious weaving of horns fit to fuel the gentle intoxication of this film. Note: the film was initially 150 minutes, and then trimmed to 135 by Malick before the regular theatrical run. It was also the first film shot in 65mm since Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet. --Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000NOKFHQ", "B000VMIILU", "B000TXNDV6", "B00005PJ8T", "1573623903", "B000UVV24M", "B005LLX582", "B000MGB6NM", "B005KQVE1S", "B000FIHN5M", "B00CX7OW1G", "B003M987QK", "B0012Q732O", "B00003CXBH", "B0009PW4EQ", "B0002Y4PPK", "B005HV6Y5W", "B003LL3FIY", "B00J11U54K", "B004UOHNIY", "B000VKL6ZM", "B00KHWSB5M", "B0001I55YW", "B002O3Z50Q", "B00005QW6V", "0783231202", "B00004XPPG", "B00003CXAF", "B000ARXF8W", "B001MZ5W3M", "B003EYVXRS", "B00406UK7S", "B000A2WP7O", "B00I6JODGO", "B004AOECXI", "B000AARKOO", "B000J4QWMC", "B002GHHHHO", "B0018BD9DA", "B004C45AZU", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B0013D8LC2", "B003EYVXXW", "B0007UDC80", "B000R9U3B0", "B007PXYWNQ", "B0032LV4LS", "B003Y5H5FG", "B00019330O", "B0000TANUI", "B000UJ48SQ", "B00007GZYC", "B000F7CMRM", "B00005JKTP", "B0002YLCG0", "B004P2VQZC", "B002O3Z510", "B006ISJQ26", "B009AMAJPA", "B00009MEKN", "B007WZTMCI", "B003L20IG0", "B000CEV3P0", "B0002DRDBY", "B000ZOXDFA", "B000ASDFF4", "B00AEBB89W", "B00AEFXVCU", "B008220C38", "B00005JLX2", "B007REV4LQ", "B009INAI02", "B000XR9L50", "B005LAII3A", "B00005OSJN", "B002DHACT2", "B00BB67UNW", "B008JFUNKU", "B00005R23V", "B00140PK82", "B00005221M", "B000087F0X", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B004EPYZT4", "B003UYUQZW", "B00AEFY5B6", "B004CQZFH6", "B002ZG977Y", "0800177967", "B001L57ZZG", "B00DL48BM6", "B001JIE7JC", "B003Y7F1OG", "B000N3SU92", "B000NIVJF4", "B001KO1BCQ", "B005J7K9BO", "B000LC55F2", "B0045HCJ9O"], "bought_together": ["B000NOKFHQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000NOKFHQ", "B00005PJ8T", "B005LLX582", "B000VMIILU"]}, "price": 10.08, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 386879}, "asin": "B000EOTTTU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519FGGE3C5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The New World"}

David is totally obsessed with cricket, and loves playing, even though he is one of the worst players at his school. His parents, Ruth (Emily Woof of The Full Monty) and Victor (Stanley Townsend), are struggling with the bigoted residents of their working-class neighborhood, but the neighbors get a bit more friendly to the Wisemans when Dennis (Delroy Lindo), a Jamaican laborer, and his family move in next door. David is shocked and delighted when he realizes that Dennis and his daughter, Judy (Leonie Elliott), are installing a cricket pitch in their backyard. Before long, and against the wishes of his worried parents, David is spending a lot of time next door, becoming very friendly with Judy, and becoming a much better cricket player. Ruth gradually warms to Dennis, but the rest of the neighborhood grows increasingly hostile.

{"description": "Superman's \"never-ending battle for truth, justice and the American way\" on television actually did come to an end in 1957 with the cancellation of theAdventures of Supermanseries, but not before it completed its sixth season, which is presented in this five-disc set along with its fifth season from 1956. Story-wise, the fifth and sixth seasons trend a fine line between the \"serious\" tone of the first three seasons (which saw Superman take on gangsters, corrupt scientists, and other villains with roots largely planted in reality) and the more outlandish escapades of the fourth season; examples of the latter include \"The Tomb of Zaharan,\" in which Lois Lane (Noel Neill) is kidnapped by Middle Eastern dignitaries who believe her to be their reincarnated queen; \"Mr. Zero,\" with Billy Curtis (High Plains Drifter) as an alien pressed into illegal service by crooks; and \"The Brainy Burro,\" which features a mind-reading donkey(!) used by nefarious types to commit crimes (the latter is one of three episodes directed by series lead George Reeves). Fortunately, there are plenty of exciting adventures on hand as well, the best of which might be \"The Perils of Superman\" (also directed by Reeves), which harkens back to Superman's comic book and radio serial origins in its tale of a gang of lead-masked hooligans who subject the Man of Steel and his pals to a series of cliffhanger-style dangers. It's hard to say if modern young viewers will take to these vintage escapades--the special effects remain decidedly primitive, and some of the plotlines will challenge even the most imaginative kid's suspension of disbelief--but for Superman fans and classic TV aficionados, there's still plenty of fun to be found in theAdventures of Superman.Supplements include a charming chat with co-star Jack Larson in the featurette \"Superman's Pal: Jimmy Olson,\" in which the still spry actor is joined by Neill, special effects expert Bob Burns, and severalSupermanexperts (including actor Jim Beaver ofDeadwoodfame). A barrage of trailers for previousSuperman-related DVDs, includingSuperman Returns, rounds out the extras.-- Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EU1Q3Q", "B000BT96FA", "B000A5046K", "B000I8OM94", "B00LT1JHLW", "B000AQOHNA", "B000FO0AHY", "B001OD8E4G", "B00BBXSPCK", "B00BBXSPES", "B00AKK6MD4", "B00G7QPX6C", "B004BBHVIS", "B000EU1Q2M", "B00LT1JKN2", "B00080ZG2O", "B002K0WBDM", "B000OPODNQ", "B0007G89FU", "B000BT96EG", "B004EXWGJW", "B00DX88IL4", "B00HMOWA0A", "6305943389", "B00KTZALDC", "B000KWZ7JC", "B00HFWETQW", "B00IZ27GD4", "B00IF0KAYS", "B002KVSJ6O", "B00CM0DIT6", "B001DJ7Q0E", "B00JDCP0QA", "B00DXLO0BI", "B00BDZV4PQ", "B0025Y3SZS", "B000J10EQU", "B001DZOCZU", "B00DYQ1GBE", "B00IYRLUEG", "B005G5NPD8", "B006WN5W5M", "B00DVKKWFE", "B00BDZV8TI", "B001CQONOA", "B00HMOW9YM", "B00BDZV4OW", "B004IF4EY6", "B001DJLD2G", "B009M4KT3I", "B00IYJFB2G", "B00JF5GAIW", "B00KW02JW0", "1631400282", "B00005UWA8", "B00A04YHI2", "B00BC0JJDQ", "B00DXLO0D6", "B00EEEHL9G", "B000051SH3", "B00C10EG7A", "B003BNCMTA", "B00KUS5YGC", "B00E5G03I4", "B00KYCA4QY", "B0041SI7A2", "1631401092", "1631401211", "B000TSTEMS", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B00J2G4ZAY", "B00005JM5Z", "B000BF0C8E", "B00308B170", "B00IED43X0", "B00FJYXQCG", "B001JFKWE4", "B001072DFM", "B004PQM81E", "B000EXDS2A", "B000HWZ4BG", "B00J2PQZEY", "B009OE2ODY", "B00005LOUK", "B00080ZG2E", "B005EVY8NA", "B00IU6HPIQ", "B00AKK6LM6", "B009D1G9S4", "B001B23ED6", "B0014VPFHW", "B005ZKCG3E", "B000KJTG8I", "B004IB04S0", "B003M9ZAC4", "B000N2HD6O", "B00009ATIM", "B002GOAGNE", "B000HEWEG2", "B00C7A8WWO"], "bought_together": ["B000EU1Q3Q", "B000BT96FA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000A5046K", "B000BT96FA", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B000HWZ4GQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 28435}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 11.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000HWZ4E8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514pfTUzVhL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Adventures of Superman - The Complete Fifth and Sixth Seasons"}
{"description": "The canine star ofAir Budand its host of sequels is on the screen again, but this time Buddy, his girlfriend Molly, and their human owners Noah and Henry have their hands and paws full with a litter of five mischievous puppies that talk.  From Budderball who's obsessed with food to the meditating Bud-Dha and the dirt-loving Mudbud, each of the puppies is as unique as a sibling can be.  When it comes time to adopt the young puppies into new families, humans and dogs alike are distraught and the puppies decide to run away.  Enter a spoiled rich boy named Bartleby who wants Air Bud as a birthday present, a dim-witted cousin, and a doltish thug employed by Bartleby's father, and mayhem prevails as Buddy and Molly get dog-napped and Noah, Henry, and the runway puppies all set out to rescue them.  As the chase winds over the river, through the woods, to the drive in movie, and straight through the farmyard, slapstick comedy and satire reign and the whole gang learns an important lesson about the value of teamwork, love, and courage.  While children ages 3 to 10 will delight in the capers of these cute talking puppies, most adults will find the plot predictable and the action less than riveting.  Talent includes Don Knotts, Richard Karn, and Michael Clarke Duncan.--Tami Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001ILFUC8", "B000XUOIQE", "B006070RQ4", "B00267N3E0", "B004YHRZJE", "B003F3NDVW", "B002WN8INY", "B0019ESNG4", "B007TGOJLE", "B00BM4Q4FI", "B004YHRZM6", "B006070RT6", "B003E4B0H6", "B008C3AW78", "B001ILFUCS", "1423169468", "B000093FHC", "B00267N3EA", "B00BJLDJ2U", "1423169751", "B006070RVE", "B0000639HP", "B000R7G6HM", "B008C0C23I", "B007U4DIM6", "B003E4B0GW", "B00005JKVU", "B001CTDH4Y", "B005GP7EYE", "1423171713", "1423184084", "B000G75AZC", "B003VADRRY", "B0043CT8KO", "B008R65XKG", "B0049GYXGI", "B002PB4I3W", "B00EIRFGSW", "B00EIRFHT0", "1423175778", "B001GZM46G", "B0000764FF", "B000059TCD", "B005IMHI82", "B00HLTD2OE", "B00069A5D2", "B0043CT8KY", "B0009ZE9XU", "B0007PIDBQ", "B000P0J088", "B008UYPDCS", "B000CQ98FU", "B000Y11B7G", "B00005NQGL", "B0034G4OT0", "6304711913", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00JK532YW", "B00596WFDK", "B000FKP3XY", "B002PLMJ5G", "B00000JL8E", "B00JK531ES", "B000OPPAD8", "B001ILFUD2", "B0000524D0", "B0000633U3", "B0000633U6", "B0000CABC8", "B00DNF1RDI", "B000Y9PC7S", "B001FTIJS0", "B00E00OGE2", "B00ABUV1GQ", "B00H0KD44M", "142382217X", "B00HLTD2ZS", "142313771X", "B007SO319S", "B00I6JOD2S", "B0015XWUAY", "B0081VMY3G", "B0007Z0NYG", "B00H5RYIBI", "B005FLSZQU", "B00CTQWIYO", "B000YERP2S", "B00AKGG6E8", "B00G5G7K7O", "B00F522C7C", "B00005LB87", "B0007TKGX0", "B000Z6RHAU", "B00H5RYN5Y", "B00E9ZATJO", "B00005JMFH", "B00009L4S2", "B0000DZTL1"], "bought_together": ["B001ILFUC8", "B000XUOIQE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B006070RQ4", "B004YHRZJE", "B000XUOIQE", "B001ILFUC8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12606}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.88, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B000HWZ4QG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519PgXxT9PL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Air Buddies"}
{"description": "Lo and behold,Clerks IIdefies the odds as a sequel that even the most ardentClerksfans can be happy about. Twelve years after Kevin Smith turned the independent film world upside-down with his $27,000 black-and-white comedy, perpetual slackers Dante (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson) return for another raucous romp in suburbia, but this time there's no beloved Quick Stop mini-mart to ensure their low-level employment. Now they're aimless 33-year-olds flippin' burgers at Mooby's, a fast-food joint with a cow theme that's \"udderly delicious.\" Dante's engaged to his long-time girlfriend but has unexpectedly fallen in love with Mooby's manager Becky (and since she's played by Rosario Dawson, can you blame him?), and Randal's still holding out for life, liberty, and the pursuit of low ambition. The responsibilities of adulthood are rearing their ugly head, and with Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith) still dealing weed and generally being obnoxious, well... something's gotta give, right? The way Smith has written this long-awaited follow-up, the dilemmas of Dante, Randal, and their ongoing friendship are something that anyone can relate to, and with Dawson lighting up the screen (in a role demanded by producer Harvey Weinstein to boost box-office appeal), the movie's romantic chemistry is surprisingly delightful. Rest assured, also, that Smith (shooting mostly in color this time, on a $5 million budget) hasn't forgotten where he came from:Clerks IIis jam-packed with the same lewd, crude humor that madeClerksan indie-film phenomenon, and Smith's good-natured sincerity is still on full display, ensuring that only the most prudish viewers could possibly be offended. For everyone else, this is as enjoyable as any sequel could ever hope to be, with amusing cameos by Smith-movie veterans Ben Affleck and Jason Lee, among others.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SIP6LS", "B00000IQW4", "B004SIP8ES", "B004XVMCH6", "B007D0FUTG", "B00003CWOL", "B004U7MQW4", "B001KKU9DW", "B005FUTBWS", "B0016MJ6GA", "B00007149S", "B000CPH9PM", "B004SIP6N6", "B001CDFY4Q", "B000I0QLOQ", "B000ICL3L0", "B000EMGJAO", "1592406890", "B001OD4S50", "B000JJ4DNW", "B00068WOH8", "B0018BZEOC", "B005G5NPLA", "B0023TCWE8", "B00363WGBO", "B0002V7TMY", "B007D0FVYA", "B00003CXPS", "B000A7DVR2", "B001J9KJ4I", "0783230338", "B000BBOUCC", "B00009MGEM", "B000093FLA", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000031EFY", "B001C0JCBA", "B006WXHJLC", "B00029LO5E", "B001MFNB58", "0783227434", "B002ZG96ZC", "0800141687", "B008220BGQ", "B00007AJGM", "B0050PYNP8", "B00441GYVA", "B000M9CB4W", "1592407447", "B00BEIYH1A", "B00AEFXVW0", "B000WC3864", "B00AEFZ7F4", "B003VPX5Y4", "0767837398", "B005LAII12", "B000BYA5G4", "B009AMALGM", "B000AARKXA", "B00003CXS7", "B000GBEWGQ", "B000AXWHSA", "B004QL7K70", "0783229526", "B00005JN2Z", "B002O3Z4VG", "B00B4VSUBK", "B000WZEZGI", "B000VXWX7E", "B002ZG97XI", "B00BPEJWAE", "B008RNYMG0", "184856497X", "B00860YIJU", "B004SIP8ZM", "B004EPZ084", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00008975Z", "B00005JM23", "B000IZJZIU", "B003Y5H5C4", "B006TTC50Y", "B004SEUJFK", "B00E1HIX66", "B00005JKMN", "B00005JKHP", "B000069CF0", "B00007ELER", "B009DA743Y", "B001G5T6GW", "B00004TJMW", "B0006HBZE2", "B00005JNZU", "B00029RTAI", "B004UXUWEC", "B0018RKEQE", "6305551235", "B007WW94TW"], "bought_together": ["B004SIP6LS", "B00000IQW4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004SIP6LS", "B00000IQW4", "B0016MJ6GA", "B004SIP8ES"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14519}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.25, "brand": "Weinstein Company", "asin": "B000I0RNVQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51tIUlFx1EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Clerks II (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Continuing the BBC's unrivalled reputation for costume drama, their new adaptation of Jane Eyre proved to be one of the television triumphs of 2006. Based, as you'd expect, on the Charlotte Bronte book of the same name, this two-disc set brings together the full series, spread across the best part of four sumptuous hours.\nIt's a faithful adaptation, with Ruth Wilson giving an exceptional performance in the title role. Mr Rochester's boots, meanwhile, are filled by Toby Stephenson, and both prove to be wise choices. Backed up by an excellent supporting cast, they're also supported by some quite superb scenery, warm photography and skilful, at times neatly understated the direction, that gives the story space to develop.\n\nIs the best adaptation of Jane Eyre? It certainly builds a compelling case, and while there's the odd slight misstep along the way, it's primarily a terrific interpretation of a classic romance. Perhaps the only real disappointment is that the DVD release itself doesn't offer more in the way of added features, but given the presentation and quality of the main attraction, that's unlikely, rightly, to deter those in search of some classic BBC drama. --Jon Foster \n\n\nProduct Description\nDVD includes Audio Navigation and Description on both discs", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000784WMW", "B0053Q9DHW", "B00AF82WTO", "B00G6HO368", "B00005JOA0", "B002XTBE6K", "B000Z27HLS", "0767020294", "B000AYEL6U", "B0012OVCE6", "B00003JRCQ", "B005GRF2UK", "B001PUTN3Y", "B004XVMCMQ", "0800141660", "B000FS9FG2", "B0053Q9DQI", "B000MGBLHS", "B0012Q3T6I", "B000Z27HMW", "B00062IZ0Y", "B000E1ZBGS", "B000S2B23E", "B000784WNQ", "B008KEQLZ6", "0767020308", "B004SIP7AS", "B001PJRAUS", "B001TJYFRU", "B000244FDW", "B004P7CNZO", "B00BQXTCYK", "B0000AUHPK", "1494464586", "B00AATUZQA", "B005603236", "1843175711", "B000GIXLUC", "B00005R5GB", "B0000AQS3P", "B001C4AFOY", "B000M2E32M", "B0009UZGAA", "B000E0ODZE", "0141040386", "0767812115", "B001PU8N0I", "B000089QEM", "B000A8AXXG", "B00005JKKY", "B001J4E1D8", "0767851013", "B000FQIRXQ", "B000GRUQKQ", "B0077PBPGO", "B000EBD9VC", "B000ZS8GW6", "B003U80I5G", "B000N4SHOE", "B001P807RC", "B00008G8WJ", "B00G7QPXAI", "B00006HAZH", "B0009PVZL4", "B000M2E32C", "190463303X", "B00005B1VM", "B001C46P2K", "B00005YUNK", "B003QP2TW8", "B0041I8DLK", "B000244F9G", "B000BKDNX0", "B0000C23D5", "B0009PVZM8", "B00141188M", "B00E1LSJIO", "B004SI5VSQ", "B000BITVAG", "B00065GX96", "B005Q7UGLA", "0679409882", "B005T0OY5S", "B00F1BFRA6", "B000NOIX48", "B008N25XAE", "B0007OY2P8", "0307700372", "B002VWNICW", "1853260649", "B007A2O3FO", "0307917703", "B00005O7N8", "B004VK744A", "B00G6HO3OA", "B0004Z33DM", "B000KJU132", "B009L2EW5W", "B001L57ZZG", "B0080QOL10"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0053Q9DHW", "B000784WMW", "B000S2B23E", "B00G6HO368"]}, "price": 29.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 214466}, "asin": "B000IJ7H2C", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SEkByt8DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jane Eyre (BBC) [Region 2] [UK Import]"}

{"description": "The Celestine Prophecyis an action-adventure adaptation of the hit novel by James Redfield, a film that moves so swiftly it can be difficult at times to absorb the New Age philosophy tucked into Redfield's multiple, so-called Insights. Matthew Settle plays an American history teacher who travels to Peru to look into the discovery of an ancient manuscript that foretells the arrival of a new spirituality. The Peruvian government and Catholic church, threatened by something that might supplant traditional religion and mainstream values, harass and arrest the scientists and enlightened souls who discovered the manuscript. Our hero becomes involved in a dangerous effort to keep the document from official hands; along the way, he's introduced to the prophecy's major principles, which arouse his dormant spiritual abilities. Annabeth Gish, Hector Elizondo, and Jurgen Prochnow are a welcome presence in this light and sometimes confusing, if casually engaging work that requires repeat viewings to fully hear its interesting message.--Tom KeoghMoreCelestine Prophecyon Amazon.comPhilosophy, Hollywood Style: Films for Fans ofThe Celestine ProphecyThe Making ofThe Celestine ProphecyThe Novels of James RedfieldStills fromThe Celestine Prophecy(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000K7VHY6", "B000QEIOSU", "B005U0ZP46", "B00CVDPCKM", "B00BBZDVQS", "158270399X", "0446674575", "0446676489", "0446671002", "0446671223", "B0096BTXV6", "B0006UEVQ8", "0446519081", "0446523089", "B005LYLP8Q", "B0044M2OS6", "0446675237", "B000NO1XHW", "B002XFDKUM", "B00007GZR5", "0981458971", "B002GZFG4W", "0446912069", "044651862X", "B006ECDV68", "B000003ACR", "1582704147", "B002LZW1AY", "B000K8LV1O", "B003UN6JNQ", "B00A801CJU", "B000A0GY28", "B005WL3QBW", "0060833025", "B0006ZXJ3O", "B001P729XI", "B00BDJKDHC", "0688166253", "0446522740", "B00FTE5R4G", "0446523941", "B0015SBNCA", "0915811405", "B000Y04R96", "B0011Z5NN2", "1932073213", "B00895CM5O", "0915811936", "B0093BFCWI", "B004K4FUNO", "1932073205", "1932073493", "1565116429", "B00H6QHCWA", "B0014BQR7E", "B001QWFTUM", "1401926339", "B002NZK5UK", "1401912443", "0593066979", "1401939147", "0981536328", "0446672998", "B004OOQMIC", "B00443YDWK", "630542845X", "0399142789", "1401944086", "1401945074", "B000E6ES94", "1401904505", "B004JOBTRQ", "B003CJXJ8Q", "B001T46TCO", "1582702152", "1577314867", "1939410002", "B00443XONE", "1401943853", "1401903568", "B001PSOCRS", "0812995589", "1577311329", "091581160X", "B0039TD7WC", "B0045HCIY0", "B000S76VHQ", "B005ZOFJNE", "B000EPFCN6", "6305428360", "B00008L3SE", "B00B1WAW9A", "1401944051", "B00KDK64DY", "0876045131", "B00005JPAR", "1932073256", "1401940676"], "bought_together": ["B000QEIOSU", "B005U0ZP46"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0446671002", "B005U0ZP46", "B00CVDPCKM", "158270399X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14969}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.67, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000JBWWQ0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PK6ERP1VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Celestine Prophecy"}
{"description": "Pile together a blue-ribbon cast, a screenplay high in quirkiness, and the Sundance stamp of approval, and youve got yourself a crossover indie hit. That formula worked for Little Miss Sunshine, a frequently hilarious study of family dysfunction. Meet the Hoovers, an Albuquerque clan riddled with depression, hostility, and the tattered remnants of the American Dream; despite their flakiness, they manage to pile into a VW van for a weekend trek to L.A. in order to get moppet daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) into the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. Much of the pleasure of this journey comes from watching some skillful comic actors doing their thing: Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette as the parents (hes hoping to become a self-help authority), Alan Arkin as a grandfather all too willing to give uproariously inappropriate advice to a sullen teenage grandson (Paul Dano), and a subdued Steve Carell as a jilted gay professor on the verge of suicide. The film is a crowd-pleaser, and if anything is a little too eager to bend itself in the direction of quirk-loving Sundance audiences; it can feel forced. But the breezy momentum and the ingenious actors help push the material over any bumps in the road. -- Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000YABYLA", "B00005JMJG", "B001UV4XGU", "B00A81MV3U", "B00DL46ZN8", "B00005JNC2", "B0007TKOAA", "B001UV4XUG", "B00005ALS0", "B00118T632", "B00AEFXESQ", "B007L6VR12", "B008220BA2", "B003L20ICE", "B0000640VJ", "B008OHV49W", "B001P9KR8U", "B000A7DVR2", "B00000F5MN", "B007L6VRBM", "B00AFEY354", "B0001GOH6Q", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00337KM2S", "B000H0MKOC", "B004UXUX4Q", "B0034G4OZE", "B00011CZRE", "B00275EGWY", "0205751989", "B000FVQLQQ", "B0010X8NF0", "B004SIP95G", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B004QL7KKC", "B00079Z9VO", "B00003CXZ4", "B0021L8UOY", "B001MM3AZM", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00606P0BM", "B00005Q4CS", "B00ADRYCWC", "B001TOD92C", "B004SEUIW4", "B000P0J0EW", "B0015OKWKI", "B000CS464G", "B0007PLLBU", "B00009W5CA", "B00005JLSB", "B004A8ZWV0", "B007RKFXUS", "B0010AN7Z4", "B00012QLB4", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B003UESJH4", "B00005JNBQ", "B007VYE4PK", "B000WZEZGI", "B00AEBB9F0", "6304907729", "B003Y5H574", "B000SFOW8I", "B00005JMJ4", "B001BL96K2", "B00006FMUW", "B002VPTJOA", "B00003CXO1", "B000J103OI", "B0038N9WKU", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00008975Z", "B003ASLJQI", "B0049985XW", "B003ASLJO0", "B001J9KJ4I", "B001FZQOW2", "B00000G02H", "1557047707", "B000BYRCQU", "B00121QGPY", "B00005JL57", "B000021Y77", "B000A3XY5A", "B000MZHW40", "B0000AC8LR", "B00AEFY0KW", "B0045HCJ9E", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B00AEBB9FA", "B00005A06N", "B000ELJAEM", "B00AEFYAMA", "B00E8RKHWW", "B00005JLRE", "B005LAIHE0", "B000M341QE", "B0039UT3LK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00118T632", "B00DL46ZN8", "B0007UC8Y4", "B001AGXEAG"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 401537}, "asin": "B000JU9OJ4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51T7A7BDBWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Little Miss Sunshine [Region 2]"}
