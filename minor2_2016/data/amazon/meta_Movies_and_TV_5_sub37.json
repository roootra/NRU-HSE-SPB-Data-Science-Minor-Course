{"description": "Anybody who has written him off because of his string of stinkers--or anybody who's too young to rememberThe Goodbye Girl--may be shocked at the accomplishment and nuance of Richard Dreyfuss's performance inClose Encounters of the Third Kind. Here, he plays a man possessed; contacted by aliens, he (along with other members of the \"chosen\") is drawn toward the site of the incipient landing: Devil's Tower, in rural Wyoming. As in many Spielberg films, there are no personalized enemies; the struggle is between those who have been called and a scientific establishment that seeks to protect them by keeping them away from the arriving spacecraft. The ship, and the special effects in general, are every bit as jaw-dropping on the small screen as they were in the theater (well, almost). Released in 1977 as a cerebral alternative to the swashbuckling science fiction epics then in vogue,Close Encountersnow seems almost wholesome in its representation of alien contact and interested less in philosophizing about extraterrestrials than it is in examining the nature of the inner \"call.\" Ultimately a motion picture about the obsession of the driven artist or determined visionary,Close Encounterscomes complete with the stock Spielberg wives and girlfriends who seek to tether the dreamy, possessed protagonists to the more mundane concerns of the everyday. So a spectacular, seminal motion picture indeed, but one with gender politics that are all too terrestrial.--Miles Bethany", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304143184", "0783231482", "6300182355", "6303506291", "6303212263", "B00005B238", "6300214060", "0790736233", "0783216084", "6303148352", "B00006AL1C", "6300268993", "6304508611", "0767825411", "6300183971", "6304509154", "6301300556", "6301670124", "6305363668", "B0000A36J1", "B000059HFB", "6300181286", "6300247236", "B00004RV8M", "B0000048TX", "B00000JQSV", "B00000JXVM", "B00000JGEK"], "bought_together": ["6304143184"], "also_viewed": ["B0087F7VSY", "6304143184", "6301792734", "B00000ILE6", "0783226152", "6301966732", "B00BBND56G"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 557907}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "", "asin": "076780192X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511NY005RKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Close Encounters of the Third Kind (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "Penny Marshall's popular 1992 comedy sheds light on a little-known chapter of American sports history with its story of a struggling team in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. The league was formed when the recruiting of soldiers during World War II resulted in a shortage of men's baseball teams. The AAGPBL continued after the war (until 1954), and Marshall's movie depicts the league in full swing, beginning when a savvy baseball scout (Jon Lovitz) finds a pair of promising new players in small-town Oregonian sisters (Geena Davis, Lori Petty). The sisters are signed to play for the Rockford Peaches near Chicago, whose new manager (Tom Hanks) is a former home-run king who wrecked his career with alcoholism. They're all a bunch of underdogs, and Marshall (with a witty script by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel) does a fine job of establishing a colorful team of supporting players including Madonna and (in her movie debut) Rosie O'Donnell. It's a conventional Hollywood sports story (Marshall's never been one to take dramatic risks), but the stellar cast is delightful, and the movie's filled with memorable moments, witty dialogue, and agreeable sentiment. And just remember: there's no crying in baseball!--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783235968", "630141277X", "6302534372", "0767809262", "6303506291", "B00005M20M", "0792151712"], "also_viewed": ["B000003KMM", "B0012GMZZY", "630596260X", "0783235968", "B00B4804KS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 393057}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.17, "brand": "", "asin": "076780922X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51A158TD4RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A League of Their Own [VHS]"}
{"description": "Spencer Tracy's last performance was in this well-meaning, handsome film by Stanley Kramer about a pair of white parents (Tracy and Katharine Hepburn) trying to make sense of their daughter's impending marriage to an African American doctor (Sidney Poitier). The film has been knocked over the years for padding conflict and stoking easy liberalism by making Poitier's character in every socioeconomic sense a good catch: But what if Kramer had made this stranger a factory worker? Would the audience still find it as easy to accept a mixed-race relationship? But there's no denying the drawing power of this movie, which gets most of its integrity from the stirring performances of Tracy and Hepburn.

{"description": "In this day of movies in which one can't tell whether the action was manufactured by computer generation or by a cookie cutter,The Mask of Zorrois a grand throwback. It recalls and celebrates the fantasy workshop that Hollywood was and can be at its best. It's an audience pleaser in the best sense of the word, combining great-looking performers with gorgeous vistas and production design, a story that is familiar yet never insults the viewer's intelligence, and plenty of eye-popping action.Anthony Hopkins stars as the original Zorro, a masked vigilante protecting his people from official corruption in Mexico and what will become California (from Hannibal Lecter to Merchant-Ivory to action hero--is there nothing this man cannot do?). He's imprisoned for his troubles, and upon his release, mentors an impetuous pupil (Antonio Banderas, more suave than ever) in the fine arts of swordplay and triumphing over evil. Catherine Zeta-Jones capably portrays the beauty linked to both men--Zorro I's daughter, Zorro II's object of desire.The plotting contains few surprises, but the interplay between the three leads is always winning, and the winks to the swashbuckling genre are playful without ever being heavy-handed or campy.--David Kronke", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00006ADFM", "B000CEXGAU", "0792839137", "6305428077", "B002PQKNRC", "B000A9QK8M", "B00641MFCK", "B0041KKBFE", "B000ENC5YW", "B008VR7TWG", "B0000A2ZU1", "B002GHHHP6", "B002VWNID6", "B0000WN140", "0800141601", "B0055CMM0O", "6305692688", "B000007T5P", "B003BJODK0", "B00000JQB5", "B0029R81BC", "B00005N5SB", "B00004XPPG", "B00005JKE1", "B000FO0AA6", "B000OT6V64", "B00005N5SA", "B00005ATZT", "0767803434", "0783233477", "B00000G3PA", "B00003CXQG", "B00003CXTA", "B00158K0QU", "0767836324", "B001LMAK88", "B00177YA1K", "B00D9EJFTQ", "B000JYW5BE", "B0049IHX2C", "B00005JN5E", "B0000B1OFL", "B000FUTVLY", "B000OLR8VY", "6304711905", "B003HKN52U", "B00008K76U", "B000U34PM6", "B00008G8M4", "0767817710", "B00006ZXSK", "B000AP04FG", "0800195175", "B00AEFZ2DG", "B00003CY0V", "B004P7CN5O", "B00005LOL0", "B0013BM63O"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00006ADFM", "B000CEXGAU", "0792839137", "6305428077"]}, "price": 15.21, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1124295}, "asin": "0767823729", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EQXJWFHRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "One Fine Morning"}

{"description": "Even if the notorious 1970s porn-filmmaking milieu doesn't exactly turn you on, don't let it turn you off to this movie's extraordinary virtues, either.Boogie Nightsis one of the key movies of the 1990s, and among the most ambitious and exuberantly alive American movies in years. It's also the breakthrough for an amazing new director, whose dazzling kaleidoscopic style here recalls the Robert Altman ofNashvilleand the Martin Scorsese ofGoodFellas. Although loosely based on the sleazy life and times of real-life porn legend John Holmes, at heart it's a classic Hollywood rise-and-fall fable: a naive, good-looking young busboy is discovered in a San Fernando Valley disco by a famous motion picture producer, becomes a hotshot movie star, lives the high life, and then loses everything when he gets too big for his britches, succumbs to insobriety, and is left behind by new times and new technology. Of course, it ain't exactlyA Star Is BornorSingin' in the Rain.  Writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson (in only his second feature!) puts his own affectionately sardonic twist on the old showbiz biopic formula: the ambitious upstart changes his name and achieves stardom in porno films as &quot;Dirk Diggler.&quot; Instead of drinking to excess, he snorts cocaine (the classic drug of '70s hedonism); and it's the coming of home video (rather than talkies) that helps to dash his big-screen dreams. As for the britches ... well, the controversial &quot;money shot&quot; explains everything.

{"description": "Before Hollywood had entirely typecast Alfred Hitchcock as the master of suspense, withMr. & Mrs. Smithhe was allowed to fashion an elegant romantic trifle starring Robert Montgomery and Carole Lombard. It probably won't replaceRear WindoworPsychoin your affections, but the film is more than a curious footnote to the director's career. The two leads play David and Ann Smith, a devoted but endlessly squabbling couple who discover their three-year marriage isn't legal. When he unexpectedly hesitates to arrange a second wedding, she storms out in a huff and soon begins dating his solid, dependable business partner Jeff (Gene Raymond). The rest follows the formula laid down by such previous screwball comedies asThe Awful Truth(1937) andBringing Up Baby(1938): David employs fair means or foul to win back Ann's heart, causes all sorts of complicated mischief, then... well, three guesses what happens in the end.The intriguing thing about the movie is how Hitchcock takes Norman Krasna's paper-thin script and adds sly undercurrents of menace. Violence seems about to erupt in the recurring scenes where Ann shaves her husband (suggestively holding a razor up to his throat)--and there's a touch ofVertigoin one scary moment when a jammed amusement park ride leaves two characters dangling helplessly high above the ground. Montgomery and Lombard keep the mood acceptably frivolous, while indicating the flawed nature of the marital relationship. From the evidence of this one-off, Hitchcock might have been among the best comedy directors in the business, had he so wished.--Peter Matthews", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 506512}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.5, "brand": "", "asin": "0780626699", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WQC2AJP4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mr &amp; Mrs Smith [VHS]"}

{"description": "A certified film noir classic,Criss Crossembraces the genre's  darkness with an uncompromising tale of doomed lovers and multilayered betrayal.  Reuniting with director Robert Siodmak after their success withThe  Killers, Burt Lancaster plays a love-struck loser who seals his fate when he  returns to Los Angeles to find his ex-wife (Yvonne DeCarlo) eager to rekindle  their love against all better judgment. She encourages their torrid affair but  marries a mobster (Dan Duryea); to deflect suspicion, Lancaster lures Duryea  into an armored-truck robbery, creating a vortex of greed and passion from which  he cannot escape. Featuring the brief screen debut of Tony Curtis,Criss  Crossis a stylish masterpiece of clashing fates and fatal attractions;  Franz Planer's cinematography creates a shadow world in which every desire is  tainted by the threat of violence, and Miklos Rozsa's score underlines a love  story that could never end happily. Film noir doesn't get any bleaker--or  better--than this.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000006561", "6301979680", "6302413400"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 433990}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0783213115", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZBZSYSFCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Criss Cross [VHS]"}
{"description": "Rock Hudson and Jane Wyman were so successful in Douglas Sirk'sMagnificent Obsessionthat they reteamed for this, his first melodrama masterpiece. Young hunk Rock is a strapping son of mother nature, a gardener who woos middle-aged, middle class widow Wyman to the snooty disapproval of her conservative social circle and embarrassment of her self-centered children. Wyman discovers a new life with his open-armed friends and back-to-nature lifestyle, but struggles with life-changing decisions in the face of social pressure and vicious gossip. Living the Henry Thoreau dream, Rock inhabits his personal Walden in a rustic country cabin by a bubbling brook, a dream house lit by a giant picture window overlooking an idyllic countryside where deer pose just outside the window.

{"description": "There are two versions of the 1995 space adventure on this 10th anniversary DVD set, but it's not what you think. The IMAX edition that played in theaters in 2002 isshorterthan the original cut, so there is no new footage. The first major Hollywood film to be reprocessed for viewing on these massive screens,Apollo 13was shortened by 24 minutes so it could be loaded onto the gigantic reels in the IMAX theaters. The new cut delivers a mostly space-centered film; much of the domestic scenes (featuring Kathleen Quinlan's Oscar-nominated performance) are gone, which may help young space cadets get into the film. The IMAX print is also less wide than the theatrical version (1.66:1 versus 2.35:1) and delivers a DTS soundtrack not found on the theatrical version. Both prints are remastered and look grand. The main features from the initial DVD are intact (the making-of feature and two commentary tracks). The new extras aren't as good: aDatelinesegment from 1995 lays down the basic facts of the moon, and a 2003 documentaryConquering Spacetakes a grand tour of space travel in 45 minutes.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004GJYRI2", "B0006FYOTC", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000PHVZNE", "B00008G8M4", "B001BEK8CY", "B002O3Z4QQ", "B00000G3PA", "B00008K76U", "B002GHHHKQ", "B0002V7OI8", "B004AOECXI", "B003AWRMBA", "047040955X", "B00AEFXPSK", "6305428352", "B000CEXEWA", "B0087ZG7HK", "B002O3Z50G", "0800177258", "B00008G8LM", "B000056VP4", "0780622650", "B00005JPLE", "B0068FZ0GK", "B004EPYZXK", "B00003CWU3", "B00003CXTG", "B000XJ5TPE", "B0077ATSSQ", "B0000JBALO", "B00008K76V", "B0001US66Y", "B000YDBPAM", "B0000AOV4I", "B0087ZG7PW", "B00AEFXR1K", "B00005JMYC", "B0000DIXDR", "B0002TSZQ0", "B00005ATZT", "B0002WZTOI", "B00005JMXX", "B00005JLSB", "0783225547", "B002GHHHPQ", "B00005JL8F", "B000VECAD0", "B000JYW5BE", "0792838408", "0792843592", "B00AFEYS9A", "B008JFUNKU", "B0087F7VSY", "B001GLX6UI", "B004IK30M8", "B000CEV3M8", "B000N6U0E2", "B007SPPANM", "B007STBUHI", "B002NZK5UK", "B00015YVD6", "B000FO0AA6", "B001TH37NU", "B0000524E5", "B00006ZXSK", "B00008MTVZ", "B005HWAOP2", "B0090XLDKY", "B0000844I8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004GJYRI2", "B00000G3PA", "B002O3Z4QQ", "B001BEK8CY"]}, "price": 14.53, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 54680}, "asin": "0783219695", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510UItLNLbL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Apollo 13 (Widescreen 2-Disc Anniversary Edition)"}
{"description": "In the vastly overrated 1998 bookEasy Riders, Raging Bulls, author Peter Biskind puts the blame for Hollywood's blockbuster mentality at least partially on Steven Spielberg's box-office success with this adaptation of Peter Benchley's bestselling novel. But you can't blame Spielberg for making a terrific movie, whichJawsdefinitely is. The story of a Long Island town whose summer tourist business is suddenly threatened by great-white-shark attacks on humans bypasses the potboiler trappings of Benchley's book and goes straight for the jugular with beautifully crafted, crowd-pleasing sequences of action and suspense supported by a trio of terrific performances by Roy Scheider (as the local sheriff), Richard Dreyfuss (as a shark specialist), and particularly Robert Shaw (as the old fisherman who offers to hunt the shark down). The sequences on Shaw's boat--as the three of them realize that in fact the shark is huntingthem--are what entertaining moviemaking is all about.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005B6ND", "6300183181", "0784011923", "0767825411", "6305814694", "B00000JGEI", "6303148352", "6303506291", "630018403X", "B00000490M", "6300214753", "6304932553", "630442972X", "6300269639", "B0000048S1", "B000005PFL", "6302765536", "6302091632", "6302824729", "6303344224", "6301570723", "6300247171", "B00008WFU5", "6305576173", "6300183467", "0790743213", "6304143184", "6303402348", "1558808221", "6303020089", "B000063UUL", "B00005B238", "6303212379", "B00005A8XX", "0790731436", "0783226152", "0790705141", "6300267881", "B00008WFU4", "6300181340", "630157401X", "6302921058", "6300214060", "6302968143", "1558802258", "0792102320", "6300214087", "6300268993", "B0000BWVBD", "B002GHHHL0", "6301888901", "B00005JKDQ", "6303122647", "6302800420", "6303610811", "6301827732", "6303540082", "6302374189", "0800198395", "6300214435", "6304071876", "6301208773", "B00000IO4G", "B00006G8LB", "B0087ZG7HK", "B00008DZ83", "6300214710", "6300215814", "630220366X", "6304457324", "0800116917", "B000059XY5", "6303212263", "6300216500", "6303236863", "630533577X", "6300213986", "6302415853", "6304935811", "6302820448", "B00004U8P4", "6300214311", "6301798503", "0793927501", "6300214370", "6302787564", "6304288433", "6300182878", "B000003KHS", "6301971809", "B000007OY0", "0790734079", "630336568X", "0790733927", "0790742322", "6301966988", "0764006770", "B000059XVO", "B00023BLXA"], "also_viewed": ["B00008WFU5", "6301792734", "6305814694", "B00005B6ND", "0784011923", "0767825411", "6300214060", "6300183181", "6300247171", "B00005A8XX", "6303506291", "B00006AL1C", "0792151712", "6304539258", "630018403X", "6305363668", "B00008WFU4", "B00000JGEI", "B00078XGO2", "6304117752", "6301574117", "0800116917", "B000005PPB", "B0056BE0SG", "6302091632", "080010367X", "6304143184", "6300216845", "6304539274", "6303148352", "0792158261", "B00000JS61", "0792839846", "6303212379", "0792837614", "0783222955", "0783221347", "0790700506", "6302921058", "6301797906", "6301976983", "6305123616", "6303402070", "6304429274", "1558807780", "B00005JKDQ", "6300214370", "6302936381", "B00000JGEK", "B0000AQZYM", "B00000JXVM", "B0007KTBIU", "0790734079", "6304039522", "6300214753", "B00005NCCP", "B005FHWWXQ", "B0087F7VSY", "B00KDU8HQQ"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 177995}, "asin": "0783216084", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514JQY1K3TL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jaws [VHS]"}

{"description": "Stanley Kubrick was only 31 years old when Kirk Douglas (star of Kubrick's classicPaths of Glory) recruited the young director to pilot this epic saga, in which the rebellious slave Spartacus (played by Douglas) leads a freedom revolt against the decadent Roman Empire. Kubrick would later disown the film because it was not a personal project--he was merely a director-for-hire--butSpartacusremains one of the best of Hollywood's grand historical epics. With an intelligent screenplay by then-blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo (from a novel by Howard Fast), its message of moral integrity and courageous conviction is still quite powerful, and the all-star cast (including Charles Laughton in full toga) is full of entertaining surprises. Fully restored in 1991 to include scenes deleted from the original 1960 release, the full-lengthSpartacusis a grand-scale cinematic marvel, offering some of the most awesome battles ever filmed and a central performance by Douglas that's as sensitively emotional as it is intensely heroic. Jean Simmons plays the slave woman who becomes Spartacus's wife, and Peter Ustinov steals the show with his frequently hilarious, Oscar-winning performance as a slave trader who shamelessly curries favor with his Roman superiors. The restored version also includes a formerly deleted bathhouse scene in which Laurence Olivier plays a bisexual Roman senator (with restored dialogue dubbed by Anthony Hopkins) who gets hot and bothered over a slave servant played by Tony Curtis. These and other restored scenes expand the film to just over three hours in length. Despite some forgivable lulls, this is a rousing and substantial drama that grabs and holds your attention. Breaking tradition with sophisticated themes and a downbeat (yet eminently noble) conclusion,Spartacusis a thinking person's epic, rising above mere spectacle with a story as impressive as its widescreen action and Oscar-winning sets.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0074JOUHE", "B001DZOCY6", "B00005JN8Z", "B000062XF2", "B000056AXZ", "B001NSLE5I", "B00AMSM9CW", "B00125WAXM", "B00005V1WY", "B00ALTQRUC", "B000WMFZMY", "B00BQ7GU1Y", "0792841409", "B00AEBBACM", "B0006GANX2", "B0001NBMDK", "B00AEFY5B6", "B000BZISSU", "B000UJ48VI", "B000UJ48SQ", "B0002BO05S", "B000CNE0M4", "B00006ADD5", "B0010YSDAE", "B00004XPPC", "B002AT8KBU", "B008FYZI6E", "B0006GANN2", "B000055Y0X", "B004H0M31I", "B0006B2A6U", "0792838408", "B000056HEA", "B004L9GMBC", "B0007TKNGA", "B00005JKU0", "B005152C9G", "B005152C78", "B000EHSVS2", "B000095WW6", "B00AEFXD1O", "B007XTDXF0", "B000KX0IOA", "B000KJU18C", "B0050FXDDQ", "B003D3Y65G", "B00005PJ6T", "B003ZEQMH8", "0792833287", "B0000DI87S", "B0049985XW", "B0010YSD7W", "B00079Z9VO", "B0010AN7Z4", "B002VWNIAY", "B007K8ILTW", "B00AMSLDTM", "B007N31YH0", "B0001US8F8", "B0045HCJSA", "B002O3Z50Q", "B000CNESN0", "B000EHSVSC", "B00007G1WH", "B00AEFXKUI", "0767810864", "B00108FMFO", "B00407PNWO", "B0018O4RT2", "B000G8NXYG", "B000063US2", "B00005JKF6", "B0010YVCI4", "B00001ZWUS", "B000XJD34I", "B0045HCJ9E", "B000P0J09C", "B000C20VRS", "B000S0KYTE", "B007Y1NR1W", "B00007JMD8", "B00871C09S", "B000FZETR0", "B00008PC13", "B000HWZ4C0", "B001LPWGGY", "B003WKL6YO", "B00AEBB89C", "B00005N5S3", "B007FQXEVY", "B00DJYKGKS", "B0047BXQZY", "B0057FGCRI", "B0001NBMEE", "B000MGTQ7U", "B000059TFW", "B00003CXBU", "B002ZD3V10", "B00014K5V4", "B00005J75F"], "bought_together": ["B0074JOUHE", "B001NSLE5I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00001ZWUS", "0792841409", "B00GGAK0FS", "B0016K40KY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18109}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.27, "brand": "DOUGLAS,KIRK", "asin": "0783226039", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FrSKZ6tSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Spartacus"}

{"description": "Clint Eastwood's second film as a director (and his first Western) is a variation on the &quot;man with no name&quot; theme, starring Eastwood as the drifter known only as &quot;the Stranger.&quot; He rides into the desert town of Lagos and is quickly attacked by three gunmen. Recovering with the aid of a local dwarf (a memorable role for Billy Curtis), the Stranger is hired by the intimidated townsfolk to fend off a band of violent ex-convicts. After teaching the citizens self-defense and instructing them to paint the entire town red and rename it &quot;Hell,&quot; the Stranger vanishes.

{"description": "Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn star in this hilarious romantic comedy about the consequences of \"stretching\" the truth. When architect Newton Davis' girlfriend Becky (Dana Delany) turns down his marriage proposal, his newly-built dream house suddenly becomes nothing more than an empty monument to her rejection. That is, until a chance encounter with Gwen (Hawn) turns his life upside-down. Intrigued by Newton's story, Gwen visits the house and decides to move in on her own. Resourceful and creative, Gwen is soon fixing up the house and charming Newton's family and neighbors - and all the while passing herself off as his new wife! Gwen even befriends Becky, who begins to see a Newton she never knew existed. Horrified at the deception yet unable to stop it, Newton finds himself playing along with her preposterous stories, her attempts at reconciling differences within the family and her campaign for his promotion at work. Finally, he convinces Gwen to fabricate their \"divorce\" so he can still get married to Becky - until he has a change of heart. It's a delightful, warmhearted and intelligent comedy from director Frank Oz.", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305236569", "B00AEFYT94", "0783227396", "B00005V5NS", "B00AEFY0KW", "B0009UZG3C", "B00AEFXYOA", "0783225482", "B000065V3P", "B0007ZEOCS", "0783226896", "6305213283", "B00005PJ6O", "B00008L3UE", "0783226772", "B000E6ESI0", "6304765266", "B00441GYRE", "B001ECDVJU", "B002T51X4Q", "B000098XQ8", "B00AEBB8YW", "B000YDBPAM", "B000FO0AA6", "B00004RJ73", "B00005T7HZ", "0767818105", "B00386EZKE", "6305133468", "0790740044", "B00007GZQZ", "B000Y11B7Q", "B00AEBB9E6", "B00015YVD6", "0767810856", "B00028HBIE", "B00008G7UF", "B0000AOV4I", "B0001AVZA8", "B00AEBB8NS", "B004IZYLP8", "0783225504", "0790742071", "B002GHHHP6", "B00AEFYT1W", "B000065V3L", "B0000897EG", "B0028ZDJN0", "B00006ZXSN", "B0000542C9", "B0000897DW", "B002XUBDRY", "076780676X", "B000FO0A9W", "B000068QPT", "B005XB8SLE", "B00005T7H2", "B00287Z18Y", "B000EHRVOW", "B000ZM1MG4", "B0000A2ZNN", "B0019HQICW", "6305428395", "B0045HCJRQ", "B0045HCJRG", "B0050Z3T62", "6305428549", "B00BLN4UPG", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B002K0WBXW", "0783225547", "B00008979G", "B000K7VHTQ", "B00AEFY4CG", "B002NZK5UU", "0783227884", "B00AEBB8OC", "B002GHHHNI", "B00AEBB9WI", "B003ES5HBW", "B00008977F", "B000N4RASS", "B0071HPOHY"], "bought_together": ["6305236569"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0028ZDJN0", "6305236569", "B00AEFY0KW", "B00005V5NS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14330}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.98, "brand": "MARTIN/HAWN", "asin": "078322740X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P95634XFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Housesitter"}

Mostly set in a teeming  warren of private and performance spaces within a turn-of-the-century  theater, the film follows the fluctuating fortunes of playwright Tuccio  (Turturro), his lover-muse-leading lady (Katherine Borowitz, Turturro's offscreen wife),  and their colorful company: Rufus Sewell and Georgina Cates, youthful, less wise projections of playwright and muse; Ben Gazzara as a grizzled old  thespian forgetful of the line between reality and performance; Bill Irwin as the naive bit player who catches the hungry eye of Christopher Walken's  deliciously over-the-top, acid-tongued critic; Susan Sarandon as a  calculatingly seductive diva fighting her age; and commedia dell'arte types  Aida Turturro and Leo Bassi. Tuccio's dying to get his play on the boards,  but as theater owners Beverly D'Angelo (she of the endearing overbite) and  Donal McCann (late star of Irish cinema, and of John Huston'sThe Dead)  reasonably point out, his delicate fantasy about love and illusion lacks an ending. Zigzagging throughMidsummer Night's Dreammisunderstandings and  misalliances, slipping seamlessly from mundane into artifice and back again,Illuminatawends its way toward Tuccio's bittersweet denouement. InMac, his  directorial debut, Turturro paid heartfelt tribute to his own blue-collar  dad; this sophomore effort (cowritten with friend and fellow director  Brandon Cole) glows with warm affection for audiences, actors, and those who dream their plays.--Kathleen Murphy", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001A9I5C", "B0010DM3R4", "B00DBFQY1K", "B001AZKB8K", "B0000AZT79", "B002WNU0QW", "B00003CWNU", "6305813019", "B000ANNW48", "B00008G61P"], "bought_together": ["B0001A9I5C", "B00DBFQY1K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["1573225207"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 48050}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.98, "brand": "", "asin": "0784013411", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G8QE496AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Illuminata"}
{"description": "When it was announced that Tom Cruise would play the vampire Lestat in this adaptation of Anne Rice's bestselling novel, even Rice chimed in with a highly publicized objection. The author wisely and justifiably recanted her negative opinion when she saw Cruise's excellent performance, which perceptively addresses the pain and chronic melancholy that plagues anyone cursed with immortal bloodlust. Brad Pitt and Kirsten Dunst are equally good at maintaining the dark and brooding tone of Rice's novel. And in this rare mainstream project for a major studio, director Neil Jordan compensates for a lumbering plot by honoring the literate, Romantic qualities of Rice's screenplay. Considered a disappointment while being embraced by Rice's loyal followers, the movie is too slow to be a satisfying thriller, but it is definitely one of the most lavish, intelligent horror films ever made.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000069I1I", "B000TGJ80S", "B00027JZ3E", "B00AEBBA72", "B0050MB3MM", "B0002KVUKM", "B002U4UZSQ", "6305258287", "B0009MDPYM", "B002ZG97CO", "B00004WG2F", "B001VLFE7G", "B00005JM5B", "B0085A9HU6", "B00006JDU8", "B00011CZRE", "B005CFBZWK", "0783229526", "B00AEFYMGO", "0345385403", "B004P7CMOQ", "B0009A40ES", "B002GSXKNI", "B001GCUO0W", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00005JL78", "B004BLJQOK", "B005COLESQ", "0783233477", "B003Y5H5EW", "B000BRBA9C", "B004P7CN7W", "0767811097", "0345337662", "B004P7CN5O", "B002T9H2LA", "B00004W4UD", "B004QSQMKE", "B002AF4Y9G", "0800177789", "B000035Z5G", "B000BKVQS4", "B00003CXSD", "B00001PE4D", "0800141806", "B00BHBOOIU", "B000P0J0EM", "B003M987PQ", "B006VRRGNK", "B008QE9XD2", "0792839137", "B00005JLKN", "B002O3Z4ZW", "0783225482", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00009AOBI", "6305313687", "B0002KVULG", "B001AGXEAG", "B00005JLSB", "B00018D42W", "B00AEBBAEK", "B003Y5H54W", "B00AEFY5B6", "B002VWNIDG", "B00AEFXYJA", "0800177029", "B000JLQQ94", "6305718954", "B000OCY7TY", "B000NOKFHQ", "B000P0J0D8", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00003CXWV", "B000AYELVA", "B005NKIPUY", "B0013FCWUW", "B0007WFX62", "B008R65XYC", "B0041KKYEM", "B00BZZMXMW", "B002NZK5V4", "B000P0J09M", "B00000G3R0", "B00005UQ9W", "0345443683", "B004SIP7TE", "B0001US62I", "B003PIUINS", "0307291650", "B000FKO5QK", "B0012Q7M02", "B0000AC8LI", "B001MYIXAC", "B005LAIHXQ", "B0009X76XC", "B000FFJYBG", "B002NZK5VO", "B00AEFXQ9S"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000069I1I", "B00011CZRE", "B00004WG2F", "B000P0J09M"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 82136}, "asin": "0790729687", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516RX1MMY2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Interview With the Vampire"}
{"description": "Director William Friedkin was a hot ticket in Hollywood after the success ofThe French Connection, and he turned heads (in more ways than one) when he decided to makeThe Exorcistas his follow-up film. Adapted by William Peter Blatty from hiscontroversial bestseller, this shocking 1973 thriller set an intense and often-copied milestone for screen terror with its unflinching depiction of a young girl (Linda Blair) who is possessed by an evil spirit. Jason Miller and Max von Sydow are perfectly cast as the priests who risk their sanity and their lives to administer the rites of demonic exorcism, and Ellen Burstyn plays Blair's mother, who can only stand by in horror as her daughter's body is wracked by satanic disfiguration. One of the most frightening films ever made,The Exorcistwas mysteriously plagued by troubles during production, and the years have not diminished its capacity to disturb even the most stoical viewers.

{"description": "The most viscerally frightening and disturbing homicidal-maniac picture sinceThe Silence of the Lambs,Sevenis based on an idea that's both gruesome and ingenious. A serial killer forces each of his victims to die by acting out one of the seven deadly sins. The murder scene is then artfully arranged into a grotesque tableau, a graphic illustration of each mortal vice. From the jittery opening credits to the horrifying (and seemingly inescapable) concluding twist, director David Fincher immerses us in a murky urban twilight where everything seems to be rotting, rusting, or molding; the air is cold and heavy with dread. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are the detectives who skillfully track down the killer--all the while unaware that he has been closing in on them, as well. Gwyneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey are also featured, but it is director Fincher and the ominous, overwhelmingly oppressive atmosphere of doom that he creates that are the real stars of the film. It's a terrific date movie--for vampires.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005V9HH", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000M341QE", "0783240295", "B00003CXZ4", "6305313687", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000P0J0EW", "B000LP6KNU", "B000P0J09M", "B000P0J0AG", "B000069HZP", "B004SIP95G", "B0009A40ES", "B0007PALZ2", "B002NZK5RI", "B002AF4Y9G", "B00AEBB89W", "B004SIP7VM", "B00AEFXQ9S", "B00004BZIY", "B003ASLJO0", "B00003CXWV", "B00096S49Y", "B00AEFYF2K", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00008975Z", "B002T9H2LA", "B00005JLKN", "B000LC55F2", "0767802519", "B004FQX5B6", "B002VWNIEA", "B004SIP7TE", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00AEFXEGS", "0792846435", "B00003CXSP", "B002VWNICC", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000C20VPA", "B00AEFXESQ", "B000P0J0EM", "B000093FLA", "B002ZG99N6", "B002NZK5VO", "B003LR5BD0", "B002VWNIDG", "B000I2J736", "B0001FR3IQ", "B00AEFYYH6", "B000F5GNX8", "B002ZG980U", "B00005JN0W", "B00005JMJG", "B0000AC8LR", "B003ASLJQI", "B000E5N684", "B002XMGGK6", "B003HKN52U", "B00AP2DC94", "B00001ZWUS", "B000A2UBN4", "B000244GCW", "B000A7DVR2", "B002GHHHN8", "B00004WG2F", "B00AEFXKUI", "B001R3YRG2", "B002NZK5UU", "B00004XPPG", "B0034G4P7G", "B000FKO5QK", "B0009MDPYM", "B000NVT0SO", "B003ASLJQS", "B00005JPD0", "B00005JKWX", "B000YAF4MA", "B00005JKIS", "6305065551", "0783229526", "0783233477", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00005JA8B", "B00AEFXYJA", "B0000YEEGM", "B007D5E7C2", "B0002V7ON8", "B000N6U0E2", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00AEBB8LA", "6305718954", "B002AT8K9W", "B00AMSLDTM", "B000FS9FCG"], "bought_together": ["B0007DFJ0G", "6305313687"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004LWZW4M", "B00005V9HH", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000P0J0EW"]}, "price": 13.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 172718}, "asin": "0790729989", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VQ890AJML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Seven (Widescreen)"}
{"description": "When Ridley Scott's cut ofBlade Runnerwas finally released in 1993, one had to wonder why the studio hadn't done it right the first time--11 years earlier. This version is so much better, mostly because of what's been eliminated (the ludicrous and redundant voice-over narration and the phony happy ending) rather than what's been added (a bit more character development and a brief unicorn dream). Star Harrison Ford originally recorded the narration under duress at the insistence of Warner Bros. executives who thought the story needed further \"explanation\"; he later confessed that he thought if he did it badly they wouldn't use it. (Moral: Never overestimate the taste of movie executives.) The movie's spectacular futuristic vision of Los Angeles--a perpetually dark and rainy metropolis that's the nightmare antithesis of \"Sunny Southern California\"--is still its most seductive feature, an otherworldly atmosphere in which you can immerse yourself. The movie's shadowy visual style, along with its classic private-detective/murder-mystery plot line (with Ford on the trail of a murderous android, or \"replicant\"), makesBlade Runnerone of the few science fiction pictures to legitimately claim a place in the film noir tradition. And, as in the best noir, the sleuth discovers a whole lot more (about himself and the people he encounters) than he anticipates.... With Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, Daryl Hannah, Rutger Hauer, and M.

{"description": "When Warner Brothers was unable to secure the rights to Richard Preston's terrifying nonfiction bookThe Hot Zone(purchased by a rival studio), they took the basic idea of a fatal virus on the loose in the U.S., added Dustin Hoffman and director Wolfgang Petersen (Das Boot), and produced an unusual thriller--a surprise hit--calledOutbreak. The other picture, slated to star Robert Redford and Jodie Foster, fell through. The premise ofOutbreak, which owes something to Elia Kazan's 1950 plague-scare movie,Panic in the Streets, is as terrifying as it is timely. As developers slash their way deeper into the previously unexplored tropical rainforests, they are exposed to radically new forms of life, including diseases, that in these days of commonplace international travel could turn into deadly epidemics almost before we know it. Hoffman's character and his estranged wife (Rene Russo) are disease experts called in to identify the unknown killer, which was carried into the country by an illegally smuggled monkey.

{"description": "Whether or not you can sympathize with its fascistic-vigilante approach to law enforcement,Dirty Harry(directed by star Clint Eastwood's longtime friend and directorial mentor, Don Siegel) is one hell of a cop thriller. The movie makes evocative use of its San Francisco locations as cop Harry Callahan (Eastwood) tracks the elusive &quot;Scorpio killer&quot; who has been terrorizing the city by the Bay. As the psychopath's trail grows hotter, Harry becomes increasingly impatient and intolerant of the frustrating obstacles (departmental red tape, individuals' civil rights) that he feels are keeping him from doing his job. A characteristically taut and tense piece of filmmaking from Siegel (Invasion of the Body Snatchers,The Shootist,Escape from Alcatraz), it also remains a fascinating slice of American pop culture. It was a big hit (followed by four sequels) that obviously reflected--or exploited--the almost obsessive or paranoid fears and frustrations many Americans felt about crime in the streets. At a time when &quot;law and order&quot; was a familiar slogan for political candidates, Harry Callahan may have represented neither, but from his point of view his job was simple: stop criminals. To him that end justified any means he deemed necessary.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790733390", "079073172X", "6300216500", "0792836510", "6300269043", "0790751216", "0792837312", "6302890721", "079284100X", "6302054982", "6304429711", "0784011923", "6302610702", "6302360978", "6300182452", "0792110188", "6300263673", "B000005PF5", "0792835077", "B0000068SI", "6303020089", "630442972X", "6300214826", "6300183211", "B000003KDG", "6301976061", "B00000J2KZ", "630118663X", "0790734079", "6303212263", "6300214060", "6301327845", "0783222955", "6300271331", "B00000K2SC", "0792842464", "B000005PJ6", "6304437315", "0792133153", "6301802330", "6304025831", "6300181405", "6302787564", "0790735423", "6303029027", "0792108868", "0790751267", "6304509154", "0790705141", "B000007OY0", "6300269639", "0800100832", "6303686796", "630281622X", "6304258984", "079284517X", "0792839234", "6303920098", "0792110285", "6305622825", "6302712009", "0790733927", "6301586026", "0800125762", "6302596092", "630018224X", "0790748169", "0792839846", "6301971809", "6303506291", "6305576173", "0783223218", "6300214540", "0783241542", "6303313345"], "bought_together": ["0790733390"], "also_viewed": ["079073172X", "B005GJTZZG", "0790737744", "0790751267", "0792836510", "630118663X", "0790733390"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 365837}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.94, "brand": "", "asin": "0790731975", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VY4VS01BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dirty Harry [VHS]"}

{"description": "The last film completed by Bruce Lee before his untimely death,Enter the Dragonwas his entr&eacute;e into Hollywood. The American-Hong Kong coproduction, shot in Asia by American director Robert Clouse, stars Lee as a British agent sent to infiltrate the criminal empire of bloodthirsty Asian crime lord Han (Shih Kien) through his annual international martial arts tournament. Lee spends his days taking on tournament combatants and nights breaking into the heavily guarded underground fortress, kicking the living tar out of anyone who stands in his way. The mix of kung fu fighting (choreographed by Lee himself) and James Bond intrigue (the plot has more than a passing resemblance toDr. No) is pulpy by any standard, but the generous budget and talented cast of world-class martial artists puts this film in a category well above Lee's earlier Hong Kong productions. Unfortunately he's off the screen for large chunks of time as American maverick competitors (and champion martial artists) John Saxon and Jim Kelly take center stage, but once the fighting starts Lee takes over. The tournament setting provides an ample display of martial arts mastery of many styles and climaxes with a huge free-for-all, but the highlight is Lee's brutal one-on-one with the claw-fisted Han in the dynamic hall-of-mirrors battle. Lee narrows his eyes and tenses into a wiry force of sinew, speed, and ruthless determination.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300250164", "6301163796", "6300250172", "6305508534", "6300250156"], "bought_together": ["6300250164", "6300250172"], "also_viewed": ["6300250164", "6305519471", "6300250172"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 109259}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790735172", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X0KFFZYFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Enter the Dragon [VHS]"}

{"description": "The opening and closing moments of Robert (Forrest Gump) Zemeckis'sContactastonish viewers with the sort of breathtaking conceptual imagery one hardly ever sees in movies these days--each is an expression of the heroine's lifelong quest (both spiritual and scientific) to explore the meaning of human existence through contact with extraterrestrial life. The movie begins by soaring far out into space, then returns dizzyingly to earth until all the stars in the heavens condense into the sparkle in one little girl's eye. It ends with that same girl as an adult (Jodie Foster)--her search having taken her to places beyond her imagination--turning her gaze inward and seeing the universe in a handful of sand.Contacttraces the journey between those two visual epiphanies. Based on Carl Sagan's novel,Contactis exceptionally thoughtful and provocative for a big-budget Hollywood science fiction picture, with elements that recall everything from2001toThe Right Stuff.

{"description": "The first thing you need to know aboutSleepersis that it's based on a novel by Lorenzo Carcaterra that was allegedly based on a true story. The movie repeats this bogus claim, which was attacked and determined by a wide majority to be misleading. Knowing this,Sleeperscan be a problematic movie because it's too neat, too clean, too manipulative in terms of legal justice and dramatic impact to be truly convincing. And yet, with its stellar cast directed by Barry Levinson, the movie succeeds as gripping entertainment, and its tale of complex morality--despite a dubious emphasis on homophobic revenge--is sufficiently provocative. It's about four boys in New York's Hell's Kitchen district who are sent to reform school, where they must endure routine sexual assaults by the sadistic guards. Years after their release, the opportunity for revenge proves irresistible for two of the young men, who must then rely on the other pair of friends (Brad Pitt, Jason Patric), a loyal priest (Robert De Niro), and a shabby lawyer (Dustin Hoffman) to defend them in court. Despite the compelling ambiguities of the story, there's never any doubt about how we're supposed to feel, and the screenplay glosses over the story's most difficult moral dilemmas.

{"description": "Adapted from a hit Broadway play by Robert Sherwood and starring original cast members Leslie Howard and Humphrey Bogart, this 1936 suspense drama is set in an aging desert roadhouse caf&eacute;, where a young woman (Bette Davis) dreams of escaping a dead-end existence spent with her father and a lunkheaded, would-be suitor. Along comes a penniless poet (Howard), a wanderer who has made a mess of his life and crossed the hot sands as a symbolic act of meaningful futility. Davis's waitress is instantly enchanted, and in short order they begin talking about heading out to the world together. Then a twist: the world comes to them--in the form of escaped convicts, led by the monosyllabic Duke Mantee (Bogart), who secretly agrees to the poet's request that the fugitive gangster kill him. Directed by Archie Mayo (The Great American Broadcast), much of the film, perhaps inevitably, looks set-bound. Most of the action occurs in the caf&eacute;, and the script's tension sadly dissipates a bit as villains and hostages stay glued to their seats. The film's enduring appeal has everything to do with the leading performances: the fascinating alchemy of Howard's ethereal air, Davis's sexy urgency, and Bogart's bemused menace. If the story feels a trifle dated and perhaps a bit smug, the actors make it compelling nonetheless.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301976983", "6301968948", "0790743159", "B000BWIZRW", "6301973291", "6302952581", "6302011027", "6301968891", "6302548438", "079074886X", "630254842X", "6302360978", "6300183890", "6301978110", "6303364772", "B0000068EE", "6301798503", "6301797906", "6304429274", "0792839846", "B00005Q4GZ"], "bought_together": ["6301976983"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 608098}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.59, "brand": "", "asin": "0790747219", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PBHHMJ5YL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Petrified Forest [VHS]"}

{"description": "Tautly directed and superbly photographed, this crowd-pleasing thriller from 1997 is indebted to Steven Spielberg'sDuel, but more closely resemblesDead Calmin its strengths and weaknesses. Kurt Russell plays a stressed-out husband whose wife (Kathleen Quinlan) disappears after their car breaks down in the desert. Tracking her whereabouts leads to an interstate theft and kidnapping ring, and as Russell pursues--and is pursued by--a vicious redneck played to perfection by J.T. Walsh (in one of his final film roles), the movie succumbs to several tense, but utterly conventional action sequences. That doesn't stop the movie from being an above-average nail-biter. It is so effectively directed by co-writer Jonathan Mostow that even the more surreal situations seem plausible and altogether unsettling. Russell's performance is key to the film's success--he's smart enough to be admirable, and we can readily identify with his frustration, confusion, and torment. Through him,Breakdowntakes on the edgy quality of a wide-awake nightmare.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790740249", "630441403X", "6303486746", "6302640407", "6304054777", "6303562264"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 326175}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.45, "brand": "", "asin": "0792145496", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ES7FRVV2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Breakdown [VHS]"}

{"description": "A slick Los Angeles callboy finds love and redemption in Paul Schrader's ultra-stylish drama. High-living prostitute Julian Kay (Richard Gere, stepping in for John Travolta) has it all: the Mercedes, the clothes, access to Beverly Hills' swankiest establishments, and a stable of rich, older female clients. But it all falls apart after he does a favor for his former pimp (Bill Duke) and the trick turns up dead a short while later; Julian's actual client won't give him an alibi, and police detective Sunday (Hector Elizondo) doesn't believe the gigolo's denials. The one person who can help him is frustrated politician's wife (and sole non-paying bedmate) Michelle (Lauren Hutton), if only Julian could let down his defenses and accept her gesture of love. Mixing his admiration for European art cinema with a voyeuristic view of the seamier side of sex and affluence, Schrader renders Julian an inscrutable, emotionally disengaged purveyor of pleasure, decked out in Giorgio Armani clothes coordinated with Ferdinando Scarfiotti's meticulous production design. Amid critical doubts about its artiness and distanced eroticism, American Gigolo surprised everyone by not dying on the box office vine. With some audiences reportedly showing up for repeat viewings of Gere's seductive charms, it became a moderate hit, turning Gere into a star and Armani into the new fashion sensation. Whatever reservations one may have about the movie, it provided two indelible images of 1980s decadence to come: Gere's perusing his \"artist's palette\" of shirts, ties, and jackets, and Gere's cruising down the Pacific Coast Highway in his convertible to the New Wave strains of Blondie's \"Call Me\".", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792844807", "6305310335", "6305308837", "B00005Y6XB", "B00AEFYC96", "0767809726", "B00AEFYRP0", "B000005RZ1", "B00006RCNY", "B0013D8LCC", "B0045HCJRQ", "B0043X1FKY", "B000021Y7L", "B000RO6K76", "B0006IIPM6", "B00005K3NU", "B00081U7HC", "0792844874", "B00GM5LL28", "B007UW9W5U", "B000BZISX0", "0792833287", "B00003CXL7", "B00005Y1UZ", "B00005K3NV", "B00005JO5L", "B002AS463W", "B000087F7Q", "B00CPTUOI2", "B001EKP5D2", "0790730979", "B00I4CWIVU", "B000H5TH1Q", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B000ETRA5U", "B00008RV1F", "B000E5N684", "B00013RC66", "B004SEUJXM", "B000HC2LHG", "B00008L3S6", "B00AEBB9ZK", "B00K6J7Q6G", "B00AEBB9LY", "B00AEBB9EG", "6305262268", "B0017ANB08", "B000ZM1MGE", "B009NZXH5S", "B00004RE27", "B000XJD34I", "B00005OLYF", "B000ZM1MG4", "B005NKIPUY", "B00005JN75", "B00008CMRK", "B0045HCIYU", "0800141601", "B008FYZI3M", "0767821610", "B00AEBB8NS", "0783226888", "B00079Z9VO", "B004SIP9VA", "B005FHHD80", "B00AEBBA7W", "0783230559", "B0008KLVBY", "B00871C09S", "B000EXDSCA", "B000WMFZN8", "B00000K3TU", "B00DJYKGNK", "B00AEFYK5M", "0767830555", "B000H5TH20", "B000TXNDV6", "B00H9KKGTO", "079073219X", "B002L7VFR2", "B000PAAJZ6", "0571210228", "B00H83EUQW", "6305428484", "B00FFT19XS", "B00AEFY4CG", "B0006GANN2", "B00005JLQH", "B0038Z5T4Q", "B00003CXBU", "B00AEFXN9G", "B00AEFYD2M", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00AEFY3TA", "B000069HZO", "B00J5LXSOA", "B00005U2KC", "B00003CWU3", "B000062XG3"], "bought_together": ["0792844807", "6305308837"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AMSS3UO", "B00AEFYC96", "B00AEFYRP0", "0792844807"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 59252}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 16.99, "brand": "GERE,RICHARD", "asin": "0792160347", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510909K7C4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "American Gigolo"}

{"description": "When it was released during Hollywood's golden year of 1939,The Wizard of Ozdidn't start out as the perennial classic it has since become. The film did respectable business, but it wasn't until its debut on television that this family favorite saw its popularity soar. And whileOz's TV broadcasts are now controlled by media mogul Ted Turner (who owns the rights), the advent of home video has made this lively musical a mainstay in the staple diet of great American films. Young Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland), her dog, Toto, and her three companions on the Yellow Brick Road to Oz--the Tin Man (Jack Haley), the Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr), and the Scarecrow (Ray Bolger)--have become pop-culture icons and central figures in the legacy of fantasy for children. As the Wicked Witch who covets Dorothy's enchanted ruby slippers, Margaret Hamilton has had the singular honor of scaring the wits out of children for more than six decades. The film's still as fresh, frightening, and funny as it was when first released. It may take some liberal detours from the original story by L. Frank Baum, but it's loyal to the Baum legacy while charting its own course as a spectacular film. Shot in glorious Technicolor, befitting its dynamic production design (Munchkinland alone is a psychedelic explosion of color and d&eacute;cor),The Wizard of Ozmay not appeal to every taste as the years go by, but it's required viewing for kids of all ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005F96UJ6", "B0000VCZKM", "B00E9ZATKI", "0792839749", "B0087F7VSY", "B0090XLDKY", "B002M2Z3BA", "076781326X", "B00C7JGDBW", "B000P0J09W", "B000URDCC6", "B002HK9IDQ", "B0000DZ3EN", "B000RPCK2E", "B000065V42", "B001JV5BF8", "B0000AM6IY", "B00335EQ0E", "B005NFJAZS", "B003VS0CX8", "B0000VCZKW", "0062278010", "B002NZK5SW", "B0010X744G", "B00CQRN3QI", "B0009XT8ME", "B000HT3PGU", "B006VJ1AAI", "B00005RRG7", "B008H6GHEM", "B00GVFJ5QS", "B00HVBB140", "B002VWNIAY", "B000BT970O", "B002CLBJPK", "0060293233", "B00028HBES", "B00322XV8Q", "B00EV1YZ96", "B000AJJNIG", "B00AATV0WS", "B0054OGQM8", "1495421864", "0739060821", "B00AEFXMGU", "0792833759", "B00AMSQBNK", "B000TPTCP0", "B0009X75QU", "B00ITVMMOY", "B00005RRGB", "B0017Q0SJ4", "0767836324", "B004302N2Q", "084318017X", "B001GLX6UI", "B003YBW2Y4", "1402766254", "B00019GHU2", "B00003CXCQ", "B00AMSM9CW", "B00005JG6M", "B0047QLNUY", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B00447L4JG", "0767819659", "B00000JPH6", "B002BIGCXS", "B00G5G7EXY", "B0000AK7AB", "B006FE83UE", "B002VWNIBI", "B00005JL1P", "B001ILFUDC", "0800177258", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00005RDSQ", "B00JHH1ZN8", "B0006IINYQ", "B0015NORDW", "B002GHHHNS", "B0013ND30M", "0792838408", "B001AGXEAG", "B0047CG9F2", "B00006ADD5", "B0013FSL3E", "B00079Z9VO", "B00F6SHECS", "B0008JIJ2E", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00005JN4W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HVBB140", "B005F96UJ6", "B0000VCZKM", "B00I6JOD2S"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 206236}, "asin": "0792833171", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GYW80GAJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Wizard of Oz"}

{"description": "Safe in their picturesque chateau behind the front lines, the French general staff passes down a direct order to Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas): take the Ant Hill at any cost. A blatant suicide mission, the attack is doomed to failure. Covering up their fatal blunder, the generals order the arrest of three innocent soldiers, charging them with cowardice and mutiny. Dax, a lawyer in civilian life, rises to the men's defense but soon realizes that, unless he can prove that the generals were to blame,nothing less than a miracle will save his clients from the firing squad.

{"description": "Although widely admired among longtime science fiction fans,The Angry Red Planetis merely a substandard entry from the genre's 1950s heyday. With wooden performances, atrocious dialogue, and some  monsters that would scare only very young kids, it's perfect fodder for a rainy- day marathon of cheesy movies, as long as you keep your expectations low. Following the standard plot of its day, the movie tells (in flashback) the story of four astronauts who land Rocket M-1 on Mars, only to find the \"angry red planet\" lives up to its nickname. The plants are carnivorous, there's a gigantic \"bat-rat-spider-crab\" that can snap humans in half with its pincers, and a slithering Jello-beast with a rotating eyeball that threatens to dissolve the rocket ship into a pile of digested goo.Naturally, there's an onboard flirtation between shapely space-gal Nora Hayden and astro-hunk Gerald Mohr (who inexplicably spends the last half-hour with his hairy chest exposed), while Les Tremayne and Jack Kruschen play the stock characters (respectively) of elder scientist and blue-collar engineer--the latter toting an \"ultrasonic freezer gun\" that forces attacking monsters to chill out. If that's not enough to whet your schlock-movie appetite, the scenes on Mars were filmed in a gimmicky pink-hued process called \"Cinemagic,\" which resembles a negative image covered in Pepto-Bismol. Is this any way to spend 83&nbsp;precious minutes? Look at it this way: When an angry Martian warns humans to stay away (\"you are technological adults, but spiritual and emotional infants\"), you may be laughing enough to make it all worthwhile.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000HEWEDK", "B000FA4TLQ", "6304507348", "0790731215", "6304923082", "B000056NWI", "B00008973H", "B000BYA5IC", "B004CZRE12", "B001BSBBJ4", "B000G28GHG"], "bought_together": ["B002TSAAS8"], "also_viewed": ["B00D9EJFZA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 349757}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.88, "brand": "", "asin": "0792845536", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513Z43J95EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Angry Red Planet [VHS]"}
{"description": "Surprisingly lighthearted and witty, Paul Rudnick'sJeffrey(based on hisoff-Broadway play)  was one of the first films to tackle the AIDS crisis without patting itself on the back or offering everything up in a sobering movie-of-the-week scenario. The titular Jeffrey (Steven Weber) is a happy-go-lucky gay man who suddenly comes face to face with the fact that AIDS has turned sex into something \"radioactive.\" Paranoid in the extreme, he vows to become celibate--at just about the same time that hunky Steve (The Pretender's Michael&nbsp;T. Weiss) saunters into his life, eyes twinkling and hormones raging. The only problem is that Steve, for all his muscles and charm, is HIV-positive, thus setting Jeffrey's deepest fears into motion. When it was written in 1995,Jeffreystruck a nerve in mining the fear that a number of gay men felt during the height of the AIDS crisis. Even just a few years later, though, Jeffrey's paranoia (what, he's never heard of condoms?) seems dated, and his behavior more self-damaging than self-aware--basically, he needs a slap upside the head as opposed to therapy. Still, Rudnick (who went on to pen the more mainstreamIn and Out) is never one to pass up a witty one-liner or an opportunity to poke fun at anyone, andJeffreynow stands as a hilarious, sometimes poignant portrait of gay single life and the perils of dating in a paranoid time. Weber's Jeffrey is simultaneously open to the possibilities of life and fearful to embrace them, and Weiss is, well... gorgeous and funny and sexy beyond belief. Still, it's Patrick Stewart, as Jeffrey's interior decorator best friend, who effortlessly steals the film with his cutting wit; in his mouth, Rudnick's lines are priceless gems. With a host of amazing cameos, including Sigourney Weaver as a conceited New Age maven, Kathy Najimy as her sad-sack follower, Christine Baranski as a high-society hostess for a roundup-themed charity dinner, and a top-form Nathan Lane as a gay priest who seems to have discovered the meaning of life--literally.--Mark Englehart", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 470683}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0792845269", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N4YQ91S0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jeffrey [VHS]"}

{"description": "Horror master John Carpenter offers up a triple treat withThe  Fog: Jamie Lee Curtis, Adrienne Barbeau, and Janet Leigh all in the same  movie.

Then the witching hour strikes, glowing fog rolls in,  and all hell breaks loose. Carpenter wrote the script with producer Debra  Hill, his collaborator onHalloween, and the two know their craft.  It's a creepy story and a tight script, and, as in their previous effort, the  audience gets to know the main characters a bit before they're put in danger.  The movie also has a sly sense of humor: \"Things seem to happen to me,\" says  slasher vet Jamie Lee. \"I'm bad luck.\" Barbeau is also obviously having a  great time, sinking her teeth into her role as a frightened disc jockey  watching the fog roll in from a lighthouse.The Fogoffers a few  shocks and plenty of good old-fashioned clammy chills.

{"description": "Here's a model for adapting a novel into a movie. The bestseller by James Jones, a frank and hard-hitting look at military life, could not possibly be made into a film in 1953 without considerably altering its length and bold subject matter. Yet screenwriter Daniel Taradash and director Fred Zinnemann (both of whom won Oscars for their work) pared it down and cleaned it up, without losing the essential texture of Jones's tapestry. The setting is an army base in Hawaii in 1941. Montgomery Clift, in a superb performance, plays a bugler who refuses to fight for the company boxing team; he has reasons for giving up the sport. His refusal results in harsh treatment from the company commander, whose bored wife (Deborah Kerr) is having an affair with the tough-but-fair sergeant (Burt Lancaster). You remember--the scene with the two of them embracing on the beach, as the surf crashes in. The supporting players are as good as the leads: Frank Sinatra and Donna Reed won Oscars (and Sinatra revitalized his entire career), and Ernest Borgnine entered the gallery of all-time movie villains, as the stockade sergeant who makes Sinatra miserable. Zinnemann's work is efficient but also evocative, capturing the time and place beautifully, the tropical breezes as well as the lazy prewar indulgence. This one is deservedly a classic.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305261296", "6302226899", "6302413435", "6305123616", "079284517X", "6302413400", "0783221347", "0783222955", "B000005PPB", "0800113055", "6301586026", "6303057225", "6300215644", "6303402070", "6300215741", "0790743159", "6301976983", "6302877873", "B0000048YM", "630150528X", "0793910323", "6302000661", "1558807780", "6300216012", "6302120624", "6302842263", "6302700949", "6302360978", "6300246965", "6304111398", "6301628454", "6304291698", "0800132009", "6301578805", "6301706587", "6301975987", "6300216721", "6302593220", "6301670140", "630442972X", "0792107683", "6301670159", "6304359705", "6301955293", "6301798503", "6301976622", "6301599225", "1558808590", "B00000F13M", "6300183890", "6300267865", "0792101448", "6301797957", "6301973232", "0782008348", "6301564456", "0792110269", "6301798732", "B000M5BRX2", "6301969294", "0783235623", "6302484391", "0790743213", "6300215962", "6300147355", "630266232X", "6300182304", "6303282237", "0792841026", "0790733935", "0792837967", "6301959728", "0783236352", "6302779782", "6302640504", "B0000048YO", "6304383169", "6302238331", "6301640667", "6300214826", "6300181421", "6303029027", "6300181340", "6304429274", "0792837096", "6301973259", "6303560040", "6302753198", "6304056915", "0792837630", "6303943004", "6302797713", "0782006779", "6301798759", "6302278929", "6300246868", "630533577X", "0792837649", "6304935811", "0800100816"], "bought_together": ["6305123616"], "also_viewed": ["6304117752", "0783222955", "0783221347", "6303215734", "6304429274"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 203870}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0800100832", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4157079C8HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "From Here to Eternity [VHS]"}

{"description": "Marlon Brando's famous \"I coulda been a contenda\" speech is such a warhorse by now that a lot of people probably feel they've seen this picture already, even if they haven't. And many of those who have seen it may have forgotten how flat-out thrilling it is. For all its great dramatic and cinematic qualities, and its fiery social criticism, Elia Kazan'sOn the Waterfrontis also one of the most gripping melodramas of political corruption and individual heroism ever made in the United States, a five-star gut-grabber. Shot on location around the docks of Hoboken, New Jersey, in the mid-1950s, it tells the fact-based story of a longshoreman (Brando's Terry Malloy) who is blackballed and savagely beaten for informing against the mobsters who have taken over his union and sold it out to the bosses. (Karl Malden has a more conventional stalwart-hero role, as an idealistic priest who nurtures Terry's pangs of conscience.) Lee J.

{"description": "Filmmaker Chris Payne explores the many factors that played into the ultimate failure of the electric car to catch on with consumers, even as gas prices began to skyrocket, in a thoughtful meditation on the increasingly important role that renewable energy plays in modern society. Introduced as a means of providing an alternative to increasing oil consumption and reducing pollution in 1996, the electric car was an all-but-forgotten memory only a decade later -- but why? Through interviews with consumer advocacy experts, automotive industry experts, and oil industry heavyweights, Payne paints a thought-provoking picture of a culture whose aversion to change and reliance on dwindling resources may be rooted in the financial concerns of a wealthy few, and may also be leading consumers down a troubling path.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005TZFZK6", "B0042EJD8A", "B003M987AG", "B000ICL3KG", "B00005JPXA", "B003CAKXAC", "B0027BOL4G", "B0013D8LHM", "B000PY52IG", "B00FGVS0DM", "B0007DBJM8", "B001KWB0L0", "B001EUSYHQ", "B000FBH3W2", "B001MWGZ6S", "B004SO26RE", "B000UNYJXQ", "B00744WZ8U", "B000BTH4K4", "B005YFGIZ2", "B001EP8EOY", "B000PWQPAW", "B00018U8YE", "B00D8NTEP8", "B00366E1AK", "B0055V6EX6", "B005BO5OQ0", "B0019KAQB8", "B0041KKYBA", "B002PLMJ74", "B0012Q3T72", "B002RB56W2", "B004IN75D0", "B005YFGIZM", "B004L51CZM", "B00BI6A56E", "B00147F8WS", "067942105X", "B0006212H2", "B003Q6D28C", "B0002OXVBO", "B002RX8G5E", "B00G0PXU2Y", "B006KH6D08", "1557885680", "B00BOZQ54K", "B00CPTUOI2", "B000YKI4MM", "B00AZMFNX2", "B0077QPPGO", "0957149506", "B00AJLHU80", "630542828X", "B004CJQVQC", "B0002HDXTQ", "B000060MW1", "0071770569", "B004CJQVI0", "B008TYGCWY", "159932220X", "160529263X", "B006H37OQC", "B0096DP4CG", "B000U6YJMO", "B000X1ZPE2", "0071543732", "B001GCUO0W", "0809030640", "B000BI5KUQ", "B00004Y62V", "B000Y7U9A0", "B00914YLAG", "B002N7W3IA", "B000OU081M", "B001P9G3HE", "B00443YDWK", "B00APG8QQO", "B0062AHEM4", "B00483VQTE", "B00HUAP0NK", "0783233523", "0470496371", "B0053ZHZI2", "B005WL3QBW", "B00AEFXPSK", "B0001CNRAM", "B007XF0XH0", "0783225733", "B000055ZOB", "B00BCV3IN2", "B0002HOERG", "B004O63TX6", "B000MR9D5E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005TZFZK6", "B0042EJD8A", "B004SO26RE", "B0027BOL4G"]}, "price": 8.83, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 424982}, "asin": "1424819547", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31ER%2B1h5B-L.jpg", "title": "Who Killed the Electric Car?

{"description": "On the strength of his Hitchcockian-thriller debut,Mute Witness, writer-director Anthony Waller was hired to direct this belated sequel to the 1981 horror comedyAn American Werewolf in London, but lycanthropy in the City of Light just ain't what it used to be. The movie offers plenty of gruesome makeup and special wolf-transformation effects, and there are some effectively spooky moments in the plot involving an underground population of hungry Parisian werewolves. One of them is seductively played by Julie Delpy, who is rescued from attempted suicide by an American tourist (Tom Everett Scott, fromThat Thing You Do!) but ultimately can't hide her dual identity when darkness falls and the full moon shines. The movie begins well, but gradually succumbs to nonsense and mayhem, prompting critic Roger Ebert to observe that &quot;here are people we don't care about, doing things they don't understand, in a movie without any rules.&quot; In other words, you'd have to be a die-hard horror buff to give this one the benefit of the doubt.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0024FADD8", "B002HWUU9U", "B004P7CN3G", "B000A2X3U2", "0800177029", "B003WTO5NO", "B001AR0D5Y", "B0002I84DK", "B000U1ZV7Q", "B000RW5BZ0", "B0001EFV7M", "B000P0J056", "B00AEBB91E", "B001GCUO0W", "B005CA4SEC", "6305258287", "B00023BM4S", "B000Q66Q56", "B00KM5F31O", "B004P7CN7W", "B00AEFYV9W", "B00441GYVA", "B00005LC4O", "B005CFBZWK", "B00L4K3MLE", "B00009OWI1", "B00AEBB9AA", "B000AM6OQ2", "B002DKGWUC", "0767817664", "B005TG8156", "B000OCY7TY", "B00JJOY496", "B00HRCBGRA", "B004SUDQCW", "B000000OL8", "B00005UQ9W", "0783232039", "B00AEBBA72", "B0002DB54A", "B000IJ79TS", "B008OR5X4O", "B000GI3RGK", "B00005O439", "B00008AOVO", "B0001Z37HM", "B00IKM5LXG", "B003EYVXSW", "B00005NB8U", "B003I7BXM6", "0767824954", "B00JF5GAZA", "B00K6D1HSK", "B001B1UO6W", "B00AEBBA2W", "0780619951", "B00FQPLZ08", "B00JHH1VSW", "B00006FDBT", "B00006FD9N", "B0002KVUKM", "B00070FX5U", "B0000E2R6P", "B009IV2Z3M", "6305308810", "B00IJS2OXG", "B000TGJ80S", "B0002CHK1S", "B0053TWW1I", "B00018D3UU", "B0002KQNL8", "B000A5045Q", "6305588236", "B000099T3U", "B004AC6PMG", "B00D9EJG54", "B002LMSWN2", "B000TUDBFM", "B0053TWVA0", "1573628174", "B00003CWRF", "B000MV8AC2", "B005CFBZ8O", "B000TLTCR2", "B00IYJRIKO", "B00008LUNW", "B000GBEWRU", "B00A1AU72A", "B0002S9QT6", "B00E56GB12", "B001ECDVKE", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000HC2M0C", "B008OR5X6W", "B002NZK5U0", "B000VSDNFA", "B000069HZO", "B006ZGROB6", "B000BTIU4S", "B00006CXGP"], "bought_together": ["B0024FADD8", "B00AEBB91E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0024FADD8", "B00009OWI1", "B001GCUO0W", "B000RW5BZ0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15595}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.69, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "155890848X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZTANHEYML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "An American Werewolf in Paris"}
{"description": "The surprising truth about Disney's 1982 computer-game fantasy is that it's still visually impressive (though technologically quaint by later high-definition standards) and a lot of fun. It's about a computer wizard named Flynn (Jeff Bridges) who is digitally broken down into a data stream by a villainous software pirate (David Warner) and reconstituted into the internal, 3-D graphical world of computers. It is there, in the blazingly colorful, geometrically intense landscapes of cyberspace, that Flynn joins forces with Tron (Bruce Boxleitner) to outmaneuver the Master Control program that holds them captive in the equivalent of a gigantic, infinitely challenging computer game. Disney's wizards used a variety of cinematic techniques and early-'80s state-of-the-art computer-generated graphics to accomplish their dynamic visual goals, and the result was a milestone in cyberentertainment, catering to technogeeks while providing a dazzling adventure for hackers and nonhackers alike. Appearing just in time to celebrate the nascent cyberpunk movement in science fiction,Tronreceived a decidedly mixed reaction when originally released, but has since become a high-tech favorite and a landmark in special effects, with a loyal following of fans. DVD is a perfect format for the movie's neon-glow color scheme, and the musical score by synthesizer pioneer Wendy Carlos is faithfully preserved on the digitally remastered soundtrack.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002ZG99QS", "B0001I55SS", "B004K4IZ3G", "B008R65XN8", "B0024FADAQ", "B0015NORDW", "B0037KMHRY", "B003TEI3E4", "B0013LL2Z2", "B0030MOTNE", "B008JFUS0U", "B008JFUO72", "B006ZOFX7K", "6305047456", "142313463X", "B0045HCJ9O", "B0039MIPDA", "0783226063", "B002GHHHOM", "B00008OE4W", "B0090SI56Y", "B0001I562I", "B000056WR3", "B0045HCJKS", "B0042YXWUK", "B004VT9JLM", "B003RACGZM", "B000P0J06K", "B005LAIH2W", "B002HWRYJE", "B002SR6CIM", "B0038OMQPW", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B0038ZITIE", "B006VRRGNK", "B00K7IPFSM", "B0001Z37HM", "B004M20YDU", "B004J1P5RE", "B00AEFXT7W", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000VECAD0", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00005PJ6N", "B0030MOXA8", "B00E5I2M9K", "B0002J58GU", "B001PPLIEG", "B001O4KBPA", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000QXDCJ2", "B0038OMQNY", "B00005PJ6M", "B004LWZW42", "6305428514", "B00005JKFR", "B008JFUO36", "B00005JKU0", "B008JFUQZ2", "630469654X", "B00005JKEX", "B005LAII3A", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00005AB62", "B000HEVZ9E", "B001AGXEAG", "B00JPS7HOA", "B001FB55HQ", "B004L9GMBC", "B002GHHHKQ", "B001MWUWU8", "B00006JC48", "B005COPWZW", "B000SUKPL6", "B00000JPH6", "B004LWZWFQ"], "bought_together": ["B002ZG99QS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002ZG99QS", "B004OBQQRW", "B0044XV3R8", "B00I6JOD2S"]}, "price": 14.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 226749}, "asin": "1558908358", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GQ2WSNH5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tron"}
{"description": "One of the most ferociously iconoclastic and experimental films of the French New Wave, Alain Resnais's 1961 feature, winner of the grand prize at that year's Venice Film Festival, is based on a script by Alain Robbe-Grillet. At its center is what seems to be a simple but unanswerable puzzle: Did its protagonist (Giorgio Albertazzi) have an affair the year before with a woman (Delphine Seyrig) he just met (or possibly re-met) at his hotel? The inquiry becomes an unsettling experiment in flattening the dimensions of past, present, and future so that any difference between them becomes meaningless, while Resnais's coldly formal but oddly dreamlike geometric compositions make space itself seem a function of subjective memory. Add to that Resnais's trademark tracking shots--long, smooth, a visual correlative of a wordless feeling--and this is a film that truly gets under the skin in almost inexplicable ways. One of the most influential works of its time.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00H206P3C", "B00IP14J80"]}, "price": 119.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 432177}, "asin": "1572522240", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/413DZX4AHDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Last Year at Marienbad [VHS]"}

{"description": "Tackling the story of Jesus for film is bound to incur controversy. Yet, in a bold move, CBS produced the television miniseriesJesus, which not only retells the biblical story, but takes a look at the more human side of the man. Jeremy Sisto stars, and although it takes a little while for him to gather enough momentum to have us believing him in this role, overall he is surprisingly convincing. While the movie does stray from strict scripture--Jesus is shown feeling conflicted over his feelings for Lazarus's sister Mary; Satan, portrayed by Jeroen Krabb&eacute;, works hard at convincing Jesus to stray from his path--most of the plot will be familiar to viewers. Beginning with an adult Jesus, who works with his father as a carpenter, the program traces his life and death through resurrection. The strong supporting cast, including Jacqueline Bisset as Mary, Gary Oldman as Pontius Pilate, and Debra Messing as Mary Magdalene, lends to the credibility of the miniseries. This is a satisfying retelling of the life of Jesus and will please those who want new ways to explore biblical stories, asJesusnot only reinforces the ideals of the New Testament but shows Jesus as a complex individual.--Jenny Brown", "related": {"also_bought": ["1401931944"], "bought_together": ["1401931944"], "also_viewed": ["B002BBLXHU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 357697}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 2.5, "brand": "", "asin": "1573629219", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EAH1ZZMWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jesus [VHS]"}

{"description": "[...] A bizarre and unexplainable cosmic event has forever changed the Earth's ant population as we know it. Around the globe, ants are communicating at a level previously thought impossible and organizing themselves in such a manner to suggest the formation of a collective mind. Biologist, Dr. Ernest Hubbs (Nigel Davenport,The Island of Dr. Moreau 77) and information specialist, James Lesko (Michael Murphy,Count Yorga,Vampire) have traveled to the small desert town of Paradise City to research the most recent occurrences of odd ant behavior. The community, once occupied with golf courses and county clubs, has become a barren landscape, as a gathering of ants has driven the town s population to abandon their homes. In their place, the bugs have constructed an impressive number of towering monoliths, which strike upward toward the hot desert sky.[...] If watching insects and other creepy-crawlies makes you squirm in your seat,Phase IVmay not be for you. The film's first eight minutes are almost entirely comprised of ants scurrying around, often framed in close up, almost microscopic shots. This footage was the work of micro photographer Ken Middleham, who would focus his camera on the insect world a year later for William Castle sBug. Such a realistic take on one of Mother Nature s smallest creatures is in stark contrast to similar science fiction fare of the period. Films likeThem!orEmpire of the Antsfound their conflict by enlarging such critters to make them more overtly threatening. By keeping the insects a familiar size,Phase IVis able to remain planted in reality, while exploring topics that are anything but. The threat seems more eminent as the human race finds itself being threatened, not by being overpowered physically, but by being knocked down a step on the evolutionary ladder.[...] While the narrative is admittedly not its strongest facet and many may find the film's plot a slow burn, the atmosphere and pace are deliberate and highly effective under the capable direction of Mr. Bass. Saul was a master at graphic design and knew exactly how and where to place images for optimal effect. With very little dialogue to work with, Saul let s the landscapes and environments help lead the plot along, pushing you deeper into the story. You can feel the heat and desperation of the desert town just as thick as you can sense the urgency within the two scientists as they bustle frantically around their research facility, anxiously looking for a way to lower the temperature.Saul and writer Mayo Simon (Futureworld) were not about to leave you with any clear explanations either.Phase IVraises more questions than it answers, but does so with a clever hand, so as not to leave you feeling cheated. [...] Legend Films has presentedPhase IVin a commendable 1.78:1 widescreen anamorphic transfer. Colors are strong and vibrate, with only few specks of grain and debris that appear to be normal aging of the source print. The mono English audio is easy to follow and complements Brian Gascoigne electronic score well. Dipping deep into the vaults at Paramount, Legend Films has thankfully pluckedPhase IV, as well as a number of other genre titles, from obscurity, gratefully allowing them a second life on the digital format.

Suddenly, the truck is not only riding his tail but trying to run him off the road. No matter what he does (pulling over, stopping at a diner, calling the cops), he can't get rid of it. Spielberg makes the wise decision of never showing the driver, even as he cranks the voltage on the film's suspense elements. As a result, the truck itself takes on an air of satanic menace--even a personality of sorts--as it seems to hunt its human prey.

{"description": "Like the Greenwich Village courtyard view from its titular portal, Alfred Hitchcock's classicRear Windowis both confined and multileveled: both its story and visual perspective are dictated by its protagonist's imprisonment in his apartment, convalescing in a wheelchair, from which both he and the audience observe the lives of his neighbors. Cheerful voyeurism, as well as the behavior glimpsed among the various tenants, affords a droll comic atmosphere that gradually darkens when he sees clues to what may be a murder.Photographer L.B. \"Jeff\" Jeffries (James Stewart) is, in fact, a voyeur by trade, a professional photographer sidelined by an accident while on assignment. His immersion in the human drama (and comedy) visible from his window is a by-product of boredom, underlined by the disapproval of his girlfriend, Lisa (Grace Kelly), and a wisecracking visiting nurse (Thelma Ritter). Yet when the invalid wife of Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr) disappears, Jeff enlists the two women to help him to determine whether she's really left town, as Thorwald insists, or been murdered.Hitchcock scholar Donald Spoto convincingly argues that the crime at the center of this mystery is the MacGuffin--a mere pretext--in a film that's more interested in the implications of Jeff's sentinel perspective. We actually learn more about the lives of the other neighbors (given generic names by Jeff, even as he's drawn into their lives) he, and we, watch undetected than we do the putative murderer and his victim. Jeff's evident fear of intimacy and commitment with the elegant, adoring Lisa provides the other vital thread to the script, one woven not only into the couple's own relationship, but reflected and even commented upon through the various neighbors' lives.At minimum, Hitchcock's skill at making us accomplices to Jeff's spying, coupled with an ingenious escalation of suspense as the teasingly vague evidence coalesces into ominous proof, deliver a superb thriller spiked with droll humor, right up to its nail-biting, nightmarish climax. At deeper levels, however,Rear Windowplumbs issues of moral responsibility and emotional honesty, while offering further proof (were any needed) of the director's brilliance as a visual storyteller.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790743213", "0783221347", "6304039530", "6300181340", "0783235593", "6300183580", "6300215741", "6301798503", "0783235607", "6305123616", "0792839846", "0783222955", "B0002IXSVI", "630150528X", "6301647734", "6304429274", "B0000040EO", "6302797667", "1558807780", "0783235704", "0792837614", "0783236352", "0783235623", "6301734734", "0790743159", "6305576173", "6304359705", "0783235682", "B00005A06N", "6304119097", "630266232X", "6301964012", "6300181529", "630233683X", "6301670159", "B00000F13T", "6301977084", "6301976061", "0792837649", "6303494390", "0782008348", "6300215512", "6305282927", "B00001OWYM", "B00005N5S2", "6303215734", "6300215717", "B000005PPB", "0783235674", "6305012792", "6304196954", "0800132009", "6302241103", "0792841859", "6304071876", "6302909023", "B00AEFXD1O", "B00000F3QZ", "6301607929", "6301978110", "B0087ZG7PW", "6300267865", "0800113055", "B000006N70", "B0045HCJ9E", "0782006809", "B00007JME0", "0780614097", "6301670140", "0792110269", "B000021Y6M", "6300269477", "0783235615", "6302413435", "6301798740", "0792837096", "6303854311", "B00005Q4GY", "0792107683", "0792837630", "6302800897", "6304457316", "0792835573", "6301978552", "B00000JKNL", "6303637574", "6305222754", "6302360978", "B00000JZIH", "6301797957", "6301975987", "1558800034", "6304359675", "6300271781", "630197350X", "6303364772", "6300216365", "6301800974", "0783227264"], "bought_together": ["0783221347", "6300183580"], "also_viewed": ["B0087ZG7PW", "B0045HCJ9E", "B0002HOEQ2", "B002GSXKQA", "B000A1INJE", "B000055Y0X", "B0087ZG7UW", "B001D8W7EU", "B00KMAVPW0", "B00J2R3VZI", "B008D1Q1VU", "B0045HCJHG", "B006FE83UE", "B00AEBB89C", "B003LMPKSQ", "B0045HCJQW", "B007N5YJWK", "0792839846", "B0002HOERG", "0790743213", "B000CCW2TS", "B000LP6KNU", "B000ECX0S8", "6304119046", "B00004XPPC", "B0010YSD7W", "B00AEBB97S", "B001D8W7EK", "B000ECX0O2", "6304429274", "B00I3C1T34", "6304039530", "630266232X", "0800132009", "6304039522", "B003VS0CX8", "0783235593", "B002VWNIAY", "6300183211", "B00BWJQEC6", "B0087F7VSY", "B002VWNIDG", "B00CNW9ZI6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 203666}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.18, "brand": "", "asin": "6300183513", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518BC0WC70L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rear Window [VHS]"}

{"description": "Nothing interests filmmaker Robert Altman more than a contained culture that mixes bare humanity with local eccentricity (think of hisM*A*S*HandNashville). So Altman'sPopeye(1980), based on the old comic strip, works best as a portrait of a busy, cluttered, cartoonish town called Sweethaven. But it is much less successful as a comprehensible story about the famous sailor with massive forearms and a relationship with Olive Oyl (Shelley Duvall). Robin Williams plays Popeye with his usual brilliance for mimicry, Paul Dooley makes a credible Wimpy, and Paul L. Smith makes an impression as the oversized bully, Bluto.

{"description": "Fact and fiction intertwine in Milos Forman's colorful kaleidoscope of E.L. Doctorow's sprawling novel of turn-of-the-century America. Anchored in the true story of the murder of architect Stanford White (Norman Mailer) by Harry Thaw (Robert Joy) over the affections of his wife Evelyn Nesbit (Elizabeth McGovern), Forman weaves a portrait of early 1900s America in a tapestry of intertwining fictional tales. The primary thread involves the proud black pianist Coalhouse Walker Jr. (Howard Rollins) and his demand for justice when a racist fireman destroys his automobile, which escalates into a reign of terror by Walker and a band of revolutionaries. A secondary story involves an ambitious immigrant artist (Mandy Patinkin) whose primitive flipbooks send him on the road to creating early cinema. Centering all of these stories in one way or another is an upper-class family known simply as Father (James Olson), Mother (Mary Steenburgen), and Younger Brother (Brad Dourif). James Cagney came out of a twenty-year retirement to play the irascible Irish police commissioner, a character created for the film. Forman's biggest departure from Doctorow's novel, however, is his focus on Walker's story, cutting away the other threads to little more than asides in the final half of the picture, the primary dramatic weakness of an otherwise rich evocation of America's past. Randy Newman's lyrical score and Miroslav Ondricek's understated cinematography earned two of the film's eight Academy Awards nominations--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000064XS", "B008HUSFTS"], "also_viewed": ["0812978188"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 233302}, "asin": "6300214257", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RA7TE2MWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ragtime [VHS]"}

{"description": "This gorgeous adaptation of Lucy Maud Montgomery's classicchildren's storyis well worth watching with the whole family. Produced for Canadian television, it's one of those rare productions that actually sticks to the book and even enhances it through first-rate performances and an excellent script. Set on bucolic Prince Edward Island in the late 19th century,Anne of Green Gablesis the story of Anne Shirley, an imaginative and headstrong  orphan. When brother and sister Marilla and Mathew Cuthbert decide to adopt an orphan boy to help Matthew work the farm, they are astonished when Anne arrives at the train station by mistake. \"What use is she to us?\" grumbles the gruff Marilla.  \"We might be of some use to her,\" answers Matthew, who has taken an instant liking to the talkative Anne.  As Anne grows up, her adventures are both hilarious and moving. It's a delight to watch as she forms a friendship with the beautiful Diana and her admirer--the dashing Gilbert Blythe--then dyes her hair green, cracks a slate over Gilbert's head when he calls her \"Carrots,\" and finds a sympathetic teacher who encourages her to attend college.Richard Farnsworth is perfect as the shy and gentle bachelor Matthew, who confides to Anne that he never went courting because \"I would have had to say something.\" Colleen Dewhurst delivers a nuanced and powerful performance as Marilla, a seemingly cold-hearted spinster whose no-nonsense exterior conceals a warm heart. And as Anne, Megan Follows strikes the perfect note, maturing from freckle-faced orphan to elegant and poised young woman.--Elisabeth Keating", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301539354", "B00005O0ST", "1558906509", "B00005Y7AM", "6304117752", "B00005Y7AN", "0788812408", "6304400551", "078881172X", "6305123616", "B00005RRG5", "0788812807", "6305940932", "B003JLL2RW", "B000LC4ZBC", "B00007JMF2", "6301465598", "630339860X", "B00000F3QZ"], "bought_together": ["6301539354", "B00005O0ST"], "also_viewed": ["B0007NMHNS", "B00005Y7AN", "6301539354", "B00005O0ST", "B006ZUMNGS", "B00005Y7AM", "B001123BDY", "0553609416", "B001TD73OI", "B00020A1MU", "1558906428", "6300213668", "055321313X", "6303314015", "B000FSLMFO", "B008LG0GJA", "6304117752", "6301792734", "630339860X", "B00AEFXMGU", "0553213148", "0486283666", "6304401132", "1558906509", "B000085EF8", "0788812408", "B0000AQZYM", "6305212112", "6305613532", "B00007JMF3", "6304274742", "6304400551", "6304143184"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 50532}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "Walt Disney Home Video", "asin": "6300277089", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CM9X9GV2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Anne of Green Gables [VHS]"}

{"description": "Michael Douglas won an Oscar for perfectly embodying the Reagan-era credo that \"greed is good.\" As a Donald Trump-like Wall Street raider aptly named Gordon Gecko (for his reptilian ability to attack corporate targets and swallow them whole), Douglas found a role tailor-made to his skill in portraying heartless men who've sacrificed humanity to power. He's a slick, seductive role model for the young ambitious Wall Street broker played by Charlie Sheen, who falls into Gecko's sphere of influence and instantly succumbs to the allure of risky deals and generous payoffs. With such perks as a high-rise apartment and women who love men for their money, Charlie's like a worm on Gecko's hook, blind to the corporate maneuvering that puts him at odds with his own father (played by Sheen's offscreen father, Martin). With his usual lack of subtlety, writer-director Oliver Stone drew from the brokering experience of his own father to tell this Faustian tale for the \"me\" decade, but the movie's sledgehammer style is undeniably effective. A cautionary warning that Stone delivers on highly entertaining terms,Wall Streetgrabs your attention while questioning the corrupted values of a system that worships profit at the cost of one's soul.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792839846", "0800116917", "6301276930", "6302256615", "6300214540", "0800199421", "6302820448", "0792133153", "B00005OCPO", "B0002GTWOM", "B00003JRAB"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 166036}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6301016289", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PRYBP6QZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wall Street [VHS]"}

{"description": "Seven years after he earned his first screen credit as the writer ofFast Times at Ridgemont High, formerRolling Stonewriter Cameron Crowe made his directorial debut with this acclaimed romantic comedy starring John Cusack and Ione Skye as unlikely lovers on the cusp of adulthood. The casting is perfect, and Crowe's rookie direction is appropriately unobtrusive, no doubt influenced by his actor-loving, Oscar&reg;-winning mentor, James L. Brooks. But the real strength of Crowe's work is his exceptional writing, his timely grasp of contemporary rhythms and language (he's frequently called \"the voice of a generation\"), and the rich humor and depth of his fully developed characters. InSay Anything...Cusack and Skye play recent high school graduates enjoying one final summer before leaping into a lifetime of adult responsibilities. Lloyd (Cusack) is an aspiring kickboxer with no definite plans; Diane (Skye) is a valedictorian with intentions to further her education in Europe. Together they find unlikely bliss, but there's also turbulence when Diane's father (John Mahoney)--who only wants what's best for his daughter--is charged with fraud and tax evasion. Favoring strong performances over obtrusive visual style, Crowe focuses on his unique characters and the ambitions and fears that define them; the movie's a treasure trove of quiet, often humorous revelations of personality. Lili Taylor and Eric Stoltz score high marks for memorable supporting roles, and Cusack's own sister Joan is perfect in scenes with her onscreen and offscreen brother. A rare romantic comedy that's as funny as it is dramatically honest,Say Anything...marked the arrival of a gifted writer-director who followed up with the underratedSinglesbefore scoring his first box-office smash withJerry Maguire.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300147940", "630018403X", "B000051S41", "6300183467", "6300263673", "6300214370", "0792837207", "6300184269", "6300214753", "B000068MFS", "6300214710"], "bought_together": ["6300147940"], "also_viewed": ["0800109481", "6300213986", "6300214710", "B001AEF6BI", "6300183467", "0790740222", "0767825411", "6300270033"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 257141}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6301412761", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41V8JBQ2E7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Say Anything [VHS]"}

{"description": "Rebeccais an ageless, timeless adult movie about a woman who marries a widower but fears she lives in the shadow of her predecessor. This was Hitchcock's first American feature, and it garnered the Best Picture statue at the 1941 Academy Awards. In today's films, most twists and surprises are ridiculous or just gratuitous, so it's sobering to look back on this film where every revelation not only shocks, but makes organic sense with the story line. Laurence Olivier is dashing and weak, fierce and cowed. Joan Fontaine is strong yet submissive, defiant yet accommodating.

At an island resort in Maine, Sandra Dee and Troy Donahue (the reigning teen idols of the day) fall hard for each other. What they don't know is that her father (Richard Egan) and his mother (Dorothy McGuire), lovers 20 years earlier, have rekindled their affair. Both, inconveniently, have spouses, which is what makes this a soap opera.

{"description": "Part mystery, part wartime polemic,Lifeboatfinds director Alfred Hitchcock tackling a cinematic challenge that foreshadows the self-imposed handicaps ofRopeandRear Window. As with those subsequent features, Hitchcock confines his action and characters to a single set, in this instance the lone surviving lifeboat from an Allied freighter sunk by a German U-boat in the North Atlantic. A less confident, ingenious filmmaker might have opened up John Steinbeck's dialogue-driven character study beyond the battered boat and its cargo of survivors, but Hitchcock instead revels in his predicament to exploit the enforced intimacy between his characters.Indeed, we never actually see the doomed freighter--the smoking ship's funnel beneath the credits simply sinks beneath the waves, and we're plunged into the escalating tensions between those who gradually find their way to the boat, a band of eight English and American passengers and crew, plus a German sailor (Walter Slezak) rescued from the U-boat, itself destroyed by the freighter's deck gun. Heading the cast and inevitably commanding their and our attention is the cello-voiced Tallulah Bankhead as Connie Porter, a cynical, sophisticated writer whose priorities seem to be hanging onto her mink and keeping her lipstick fresh. Gradually, the others find Porter and her lifeboat, forming a temporary community that inevitably suggests a careful cross section of archetypes, from wealthy industrialist (Henry Hull) to ship's boiler men (John Hodiak and William Bendix).Hitchcock juggles the interpersonal skirmishes between the boat's occupants with the mystery of their German prisoner, which itself becomes a meditation on the fine line between nationalism and morality, a line that Slezak walks delicately until his identity is resolved. Visually, Hitchcock transforms his back-lot set and its rear-projected cloudbanks into a desolate stretch of ocean, while capturing the horror of an amputation through an economical set of images culminating in an empty boot.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0045HCJ9E", "6302413435", "0783236352", "B002GSXKQA", "0790743159", "1558807780", "6301800974", "0783235623", "0769403468", "6301640667", "6301975987", "6301973232", "1558808590", "630150528X", "0800100832", "6301564456", "6302226899", "6301959728", "B000EVD38G", "B00004R67T", "6302909023", "B00005Q4GY", "6304457316", "0790743213", "6300246965", "6301798503", "6302360978", "0783221347", "6301797957", "6301973410", "6300183580", "6304196954", "6301798708", "B000056BRF", "6302842263", "6304359705", "0792108280", "079074886X"], "also_viewed": ["B001D8W7F4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 319371}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6301798732", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AC1NXHYzL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lifeboat (The Hitchcock Collection) [VHS]"}

{"description": "A flawed but stylish adaptation of the Chester Gould comic strip by director Warren Beatty, who also stars in the title role. The minimalist plot involves a battalion of baddies who confront the intrepid detective in a series of strung-together vignettes. Al Pacino is a comedic if overblown standout as Big Boy Caprice, and Madonna simply smolders as aggressive blonde bombshell Breathless Mahoney. It matters not that the plot is Spartan, as this dazzling eye candy is much enhanced by Stephen Sondheim's songs, including the Academy Award-winning ditty, \"Sooner or Later (I Always Get My Man).\" Beatty took his cue from the source material and concentrated on the relationships between these people, whether strained, romantic, or hateful. The performances are subtle and more amusing than you would expect from such a visually bold picture. Shot in bright, primary colors, this also won Oscars for Best Art/Set Direction and Makeup (for those inventively hideous criminals).

Even though Tarkovsky's meanings and methods are sometimes mystifying,Solarishas a way of crawling inside your head, especially given the slow pace and general lack of forward momentum.

{"description": "The short life and passionate music of romantic composer Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Chopin provide the foundations for this 1945 drama, which proved influential in its gaudy, undeniably watchable formula of historical exaggeration and shrewdly simplified motives for its principals.  In an Oscar-nominated performance, Cornel Wilde presents the Polish native as a passionate nationalist driven by his love of his native country and his hatred of its czarist regime, a thematic focus that can be forgiven in light of the political backdrop at the time of the production.  Already a prodigy in his native land, where he's mentored by a shamelessly scenery-chewing Paul Muni as Professor Elsner, Chopin flees to Paris where his flashing eyes, dark nimbus of curls, and florid technique earn him stardom, while his involvement with the writer George Sand (a beautiful Merle Oberon, even when draped in then-provocatively masculine garb) introduces a romantic crescendo.  Still, the tortured pianist-composer pines for his homeland, frets about its political fate, and begins to wither under the rigors of his new career as ur-superstar; in a typically over-the-top but riveting image, we see drops of blood spatter across the keyboard as he thunders through a recital, gallantly ignoring his failing health to spread his music and, by extension, awareness of Poland's fate.  Numerous subsequent musical dramas (including two moreSong-titled biographies from the same studio) would ply a similar mix of grand gestures and larger-than-life emotions, yet the most interesting comparison to be made is with 1991'sImpromptu, a more acerbic spin through the Sand/Chopin affair (and the Parisian demimonde including Alfred DeMusset, Franz Liszt, and Eugene Delacroix) directed by frequent Stephen Sondheim collaborator James Lapine.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00031TXC2", "B004CZZZJA", "B0042ZEEI8", "6302424852", "630220898X", "6302593220", "6301969049"], "bought_together": ["B004CZZZJA", "B00031TXC2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 253199}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.55, "brand": "", "asin": "630242500X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZNH28G93L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Song to Remember [VHS]"}

{"description": "There's a satisfying sense of closure to the definitive noir kick achieved inThe Big Heat: its director, Fritz Lang, had forged early links from German expressionism to the emergence of film noir, so it's entirely logical that the expatriate director would help codify the genre with this brutal 1953 film. Visually, his scenes exemplify the bold contrasts, deep shadows, and heightened compositions that define the look of noir, and he matches that success with the darkly pessimistic themes of this revenge melodrama.The story coheres around the suicide of a crooked cop, and the subsequent struggle of an honest detective, Dave Bannion (Glenn Ford), to navigate between a corrupt city government and a ruthless mobster to uncover the truth. Initially, the violence here seems almost timid by comparison to the more explicit carnage now commonplace in films, yet the story accelerates as its plot arcs toward Bannion's showdown with kingpin Lagana (Alexander Scourby) and his psychotic henchman, the sadistic Vince Stone, given an indelible nastiness by Lee Marvin. When Bannion's wife is killed by a car bomb intended for the detective, both the hero and the story go ballistic: suspended from the force, he embarks on a crusade of revenge that suggests a template for Charles Bronson'sDeath Wishfilms, each step pushing Lagana and Stone toward a showdown. Bodies drop, dominoes tumbled by the escalating war between the obsessed Bannion and his increasingly vicious adversaries.Lang's disciplined visual design and the performances (especially those of Ford, Marvin, Jeanette Nolan as the dead cop's scheming widow, and Gloria Grahame as Marvin's girlfriend) enable the film to transcend formula, as do several memorable action scenes--when an enraged Marvin hurls scalding coffee at the feisty Debby (Grahame), we're both shattered by the violence of his attack, and aware that he's shifted the balance of power.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302801133", "6300269035"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 361757}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.49, "brand": "", "asin": "6302797675", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/215RHH845AL.jpg", "title": "Big Heat [VHS]"}

{"description": "Consistently cited by critics worldwide as one of the greatest films ever made, Jean Renoir's bittersweet drama of life, love, class, and the social code of manners and behavior (\"the rules of the game\") is a savage critique undertaken with sensitivity and compassion. Renoir's catch-phrase through the film, \"Everyone has their reasons,\" develops a multilayered meaning by the conclusion. A young aviator (Roland Toutain) commits a serious social faux pas by alluding to an affair on national radio. To avert a scandal, the cultured Robert de la Chesnaye (Marcel Dalio), husband to the aviator's mistress, Christine (Nora Gregor), and a philanderer in his own right, invites all to a weekend hunting party in his country mansion. The complicated maze of marriages and mistresses (social register and servant class alike) is plotted like a bedroom farce, but the tone soon takes a darker cast. Renoir, who also takes the pivotal role as Andre's jovial pal and de la Chesnaye confidant Octave, deftly blends high comedy with cutting satire as he parallels the upstairs-downstairs affairs. The film builds to a comic pitch with the hilarious performance of Julien Carette as a rabbit poacher turned groundskeeper, but soon turns tragic in a devastating conclusion. The film was roundly condemned and banned in France upon its 1939 release, but years later (out of the shadow of WWII) the film was rediscovered for the masterpiece that it is.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 412283}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "The Rules of the Game [VHS]", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304628188"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JT64E0AAL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "6302969301"}

It is based on characters created by Burton, the former Disney animator best known as the director ofPee-wee's Big Adventure,Beetlejuice,Edward Scissorhands, and the first twoBatmanmovies.

{"description": "Inspired casting and Walter Lang's deft direction breathe abundant life into WEEK-END IN HAVANA, in which a woman's trip to Cuba leads to romance, laughter, and sizzling songs. Nan Spencer (Alice Faye) has saved up for years for her vacation to Havana and is sorely disappointed when the cruise ship runs aground near Florida. While the other guests accept vouchers for another trip, Nan refuses because this was her only opportunity to get away. When she intimates that the failure with the ship was the captain's fault, the cruise company's vice president, Jay Williams (John Payne), personally accompanies Nan to Havana to avoid any more serious legal repercussions.

{"description": "The Crowset the standard for dark and violent comic-book movies (likeSpawnor director Alex Proyas's superior follow-up,Dark City), but it will forever be remembered as the film during which star Brandon Lee (son of martial arts legend Bruce Lee) was accidentally killed on the set by a loaded gun. The filmmakers were able to digitally sample what they'd captured of Lee's performance and piece together enough footage to make the movie releasable. Indeed, it is probably more fascinating for that post-production story than for the tale on the screen.The Crowis appropriately cloaked in ominous expressionistic shadows, oozing urban dread and occult menace from every dank concrete crack, but it really adds up to a simple and perfunctory tale of ritual revenge. Guided by a portentous crow (standing in for Poe's raven), Lee plays a deceased rock musician who returns from the grave to systematically torture and kill the outlandishly violent gang of hoodlums who murdered him and his fianc&eacute;e the year before. The film is worth watching for its compelling visuals and genuinely nightmarish, otherworldly ambience.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"bought_together": ["6304259093"], "also_viewed": ["6301792734", "B00000K3AN"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 359394}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.3, "brand": "", "asin": "6303187064", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71DFN9XXGPL._SY300_.gif", "title": "The Crow [VHS]"}
{"description": "Although scarcely seen in its original 3-D, and entirely out of sight for a decade and a half after its producer-star died,Hondohas maintained a high rep among John Wayne fans--and it wasn't even directed by Howard Hawks or John Ford. (Actually, Ford did shoot some second-unit stuff while visiting Wayne on location.) Half-breed Hondo, companioned only by an antisocial dog, tends to be more sympathetic toward the Apaches than toward the white society he occasionally scouts for. He falls into uneasy friendship with a New Mexico farmwoman (Geraldine Page) whose husband deserts her for long stretches, and whose son (Lee Aaker) is blood brother to the local Apache chieftain. A good, spare frontier tale--Louis L'Amour via James Edward (Angel and the Badman) Grant--in which danger and solace come in unexpected ways. John Farrow, who did direct, brings it in at a lean 84 minutes. Page was Oscar&#xAE;-nominated for this first film role.--Richard T.

She and her cameraman, played by Michael Douglas (Wall Street,American President), hook up with a whistleblower at the plant, played by Jack Lemmon (Save the Tiger,Missing).

When the hood starts contributing better story ideas and dialogue than what the official playwright can conjure, questions (not unlike those ofAmadeus) about the price we pay to make art at the expense of other responsibilities are intriguingly raised. Palminteri gives a very interesting performance as the enforcer waking up to the desperate (and almost feminine) demands of his own creative psyche, and Dianne Wiest (who won an Oscar), Tracey Ullman, Jim Broadbent, and Jennifer Tilly are very funny together playing the ensemble cast of Cusack's play.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304039166", "6303011411", "B00003CY69", "B00003CXGR", "6302697042", "6301964365", "B000NNOYH4", "6300271870", "0783221347", "630146494X", "6300183513", "6301971922", "B00000J2L7"], "bought_together": ["6304039166"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 322231}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.94, "brand": "", "asin": "6303430546", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512C398T59L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bullets Over Broadway [VHS]"}
{"description": "Jessica Lange is a social worker who falls for an abandoned newborn and breaks all the rules by bringing him home. Halle Berry is the homeless druggie who dumped the baby. One of the film's best attributes is that it reveals everyone's perspective, though much of the story is told from Berry's point of view. Strung out on crack, Berry's character thinks nothing of hiding her baby in a cardboard box near a dumpster before going off for a fix. We watch Berry painfully pull herself up out of the gutter and make a life for herself. She embraces decency and sobriety and becomes the person she might have always been had her childhood been different. After Lange and her amiable spouse (David Strathairn) have formed strong family ties with this difficult child, they find themselves fighting to keep him when Berry decides she wants Isaiah back. Naomi Foner's clever script reveals a legal system that is as much a character in this painful story as the attorney (Samuel L. Jackson) who takes on the case pro bono. Though the film ultimately flounders under a hesitant ending, Lange is such a dynamo that this tragic story still comes recommended.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304773285", "6300270971", "6302779278"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 333536}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6303574203", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41T2MBSNADL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Losing Isaiah [VHS]"}

The mentally unstable Peggy Gravel (Mink Stole, in a superb display of  overacting) and her 300-pound-plus maid Grizelda must take it on the lam after  Grizelda smothers Peggy's husband under her elephantine buttocks. They find  themselves in Mortville, a shanty fiefdom ruled by the grotesque Queen Carlotta  (the incomparable Edith Massey).

{"description": "Ever since this convoluted thriller dazzled audiences and critics in 1995 and won an Oscar for Christopher McQuarrie's twisting screenplay,The Usual Suspectshas continued to divide movie lovers into opposite camps. While a lot of people take great pleasure from the movie's now-famous central mystery (namely, \"Who is Keyser S&ouml;ze?\"), others aren't so easily impressed by a movie that's too enamored of its own cleverness to make much sense. After all, what are we to make of a final scene that renders the entire movie obsolete? Half the fun ofThe Usual Suspectsis the debate it provokes and the sheer pleasure of watching its dynamic cast in action, led (or should we say, mislead) by Oscar-winner Kevin Spacey as the club-footed con man who recounts the saga of enigmatic Hungarian mobster Keyser S&ouml;ze. Spacey's in a band of thieves that includes Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Pollak, and Benicio Del Toro, all gathered in a plot to steal a large shipment of cocaine. The story is told in flashback as a twisted plot being described by Spacey's character to an investigating detective (Chazz Palmintieri), andThe Usual Suspectsis enjoyable for the way it keeps the viewer guessing right up to its surprise ending. Whether that ending will enhance or extinguish the pleasure is up to each viewer to decide. Even if it ultimately makes little or no sense at all, this is a funny and fiendish thriller, guaranteed to entertain even its vocal detractors.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0800125762", "0800125789", "6302935148", "0783222955", "B00005QATY", "B00003CWL5", "6304259131", "6300215741"], "also_viewed": ["6304140851"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 469637}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6303908306", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z2K7HPEJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Usual Suspects, Letterbox Edition  [VHS]"}
{"description": "There were only two ways for \"classicTrek\" cast members to appear in a movie with the cast ofStar Trek: The Next Generation: either Capt. Kirk and his contemporaries would have to be very, very old, or there would be some time travel involved in the plot. Since geriatric heroes aren't very exciting (despite a welcomed cameo appearance by the aged Dr. McCoy),Star Trek: Generationsunites Capt. Kirk (William Shatner) and Capt. Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) in a time-jumping race to stop a madman's quest for heavenly contentment. When a mysterious energy coil called the Nexus nearly destroys the newly christened U.S.S.Enterprise-B, the just-retired Capt. Kirk is lost and presumed dead. But he's actually been happily trapped in the timeless purgatory of the Nexus--an idyllic state of being described by the mystical Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg) as \"pure joy.\" Picard must convince Kirk to leave this artificial comfort zone and confront Dr. Soran (Malcolm McDowell), the madman who will threaten billions of lives to be reunited with the addictive pleasure of the Nexus.

{"description": "If aliens came down to earth to see if humanity was worth saving, showing themShort Cuts, Robert Altman's bluesy riff on life in L.A. in the '90s, would not be a good idea. Based on the stories of Raymond Carver (adapted by Altman and Frank Barhydt), this ambitious film is a devilish valentine to living in L.A., where happiness comes at a premium. There are at least eight separate stories that crisscross, most about people who choose not to relate to the lives they are living. Seemingly by design, none of the stories (nor the performances for that matter) have more impact than the others--this is a true mosaic film. The most representative plot deals with a group of friends (Buck Henry, Fred Ward, and Huey Lewis) who decide to keep fishing even after discovering a body in the river. The story works as a morose comedy and a flag holder for the movie: the inability to take the correct action. Others would rather talk about seeing Alex Trebek than discuss their faltering relationships. A huge and talented cast twists in the wind, bumping into moments of truth, sex, and passion. Some even come out all right in the end. The accidental nature of life--a common theme in many Altman films--has never been so maddeningly persistent, or absorbing. The score by Mark Isham with songs sung by Annie Ross (also a cast member) fuels the moodiness, as does the opening number in which Medfly helicopters spray the town to the tune \"Prisoner of Life.\" Delivering the film a year after his biggest hit in two decades,The Player, Altman proved his artistic tenacity as an aged artist with the heart of a new filmmaker: he's not afraid of risking it all.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300181723", "B0001DHSHE"], "also_viewed": ["6301826558"]}, "price": 22.18, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 432267}, "asin": "6303995705", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51D5MBSWWML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Short Cuts [VHS]"}

{"description": "Here's a classic Hollywood star vehicle.Up Close and Personal--the story of Tally Atwater (Michelle Pfeiffer), an inexperienced but ambitious TV news personality, and her well-weathered journalistic mentor, Warren Justice (Robert Redford)--was carefully tailored to fit its stars. What began as a screenplay based on the biography of troubled TV anchorwoman Jessica Savitch (Golden Girl, by Alanna Nash) took more than eight years to reach the screen, written and rewritten, on and off, over the years by husband-and-wife team John Gregory Dunne and Joan Didion, mainly because they needed the work to qualify for the splendid Writers' Guild health-insurance plan. Although the considerable charisma of Pfeiffer and Redford go a long way, in many respects Nash's original nonfiction book (and even Dunne's peculiarly disingenuous \"insider\" account of the writing of the screenplay,Monster: Living Off the Big Screen) offers tales more compelling than the one that eventually made it to the screen. But, all things considered, that's a little like comparing apples and oranges, since the slickUp Close and Personalbears about as much resemblance to its gritty original source material as...well, an apple does to an orange. Critic Roger Ebert, who awarded the movie three stars, nevertheless said he was reminded of the time producer Samuel Goldwyn commissioned a screenplay about the Lindbergh kidnapping. Only, to quote Goldwyn, \"it can't be about kidnapping, which is against the Code. For legal reasons, we have to change the name from Lindbergh. And the kid's father shouldn't fly.\" Read the book, see the movie, read the book about writing the movie.

{"description": "A little-known chapter of American labor history is brought vividly to life in this period drama from writer-director John Sayles. It's a fictional story about labor wars among West Virginia coal miners during the 1920's, but every detail is so right that the film has the unmistakable ring of truth. The tension begins when the Stone Mountain Coal Company of Matewan, West Virginia, announces a lower pay rate for miners, who respond by calling a strike under the leadership of a United Mine Workers representative (Chris Cooper). Proving strength in numbers, the miners are joined by black and Italian miners who initially resist the strike, and a fateful battle ensues when detectives hired by the coal company attempt to evict miners from company housing. Violence erupts in a sequence of astonishing, cathartic intensity, andMatewanachieves a rare degree of moral complexity combined with gut-wrenching tragedy. The film salutes a pacifist ideal while recognizing that personal and political convictions often must be defended with violence. To illustrate this point, Sayles enlisted master cinematographer Haskell Wexler, who creates the film's authentic visual texture--a triumph of artistry over limited resources. The result is a milestone of independent filmmaking, andMatewanremains one of Sayles's finest achievements.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000N2HDG4", "6301996135"], "bought_together": ["B00005KA73"]}, "price": 39.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 319456}, "asin": "6304383657", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519GJ691F1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Matewan [VHS]"}

{"description": "Akira Kurosawa's rousingSeven Samuraiwas a natural for an American remake--after all, the codes and conventions of ancient Japan and the Wild West (at least the mythical movie West) are not so very far apart. ThusThe Magnificent Seveneffortlessly turns samurai into cowboys (the same trick worked more than once: Kurosawa'sYojimbobecame Sergio Leone'sA Fistful of Dollars). The beleaguered denizens of a Mexican village, weary of attacks by banditos, hire seven gunslingers to repel the invaders once and for all. The gunmen are cool and capable, with most of the actors playing them just on the cusp of '60s stardom: Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn. The man who brings these warriors together is Yul Brynner, the baddest bald man in the West. There's nothing especially stylish about the approach of veteran director John Sturges (The Great Escape), but the storytelling is clear and strong, and the charisma of the young guns fairly flies off the screen. If that isn't enough to awaken the 12-year-old kid inside anyone, the unforgettable Elmer Bernstein music will do it: bum-bum-ba-bum, bum-ba-bum-ba-bum....

The story of Peron's rise to power with her husband (Jonathan Pryce) is narrated in song by peasant insurrectionist Che (Antonio Banderas), as Evita's glamour, poise, and ultimate tragedy inspire a nation in the midst of political and social upheaval. The film is a powerful one, visually stunning and epic in its scope, and yet highly emotional in both the well-known songs and the performances. Pryce portrays a deeply flawed man, ruthless and yet devoted to his wife. Banderas is a swashbuckling figure, instilling passion in the heart of Eva Peron. And Madonna gives a strong and commanding performance as a woman who loves her husband and loves her people but must fight the stirring passion inside her.

The trouble with the film is that it refuses to yield important information about its central figure. Davies's character has some kind of undefined problem with his mother, religion, ambition, masturbation, and much else, but without access to his internal dialogue, we only see him as a twitchy insect for whom regular sex with a beautiful girlfriend inexplicably does nothing for his ego. Don't blame Davies: he does this nerve-damaged bit all the time, and in the hands of a good director his performances are controlled and economical (seeSpanking the Monkey). However, his director onGoing All the Way--Mark Pellington--has no idea of how to shape the actor's abilities.--Tom Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 468417}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "6304766017", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CQZ3JXVAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Going All the Way [VHS]"}

This film spawned a TV series and inspired fan Chris Carter to create his own cult TV show two decades later:The X-Files.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004WLW8", "B000ATQYWY", "B0002ZB7OG", "B0001VFPZS", "B0002TKB5I", "0792845684"], "also_viewed": ["B00004WLW8"]}, "price": 25.48, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 333252}, "asin": "6304960654", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WH1ZE7VKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Night Strangler [VHS]"}

{"description": "What do a down-and-out Broadway producer, his anxiety-attack-prone accountant, a go-go dancing Swedish secretary, and a Nazi playwright have in common? They're all part of Mel Brooks's wild and wacky first film, THE PRODUCERS. In this hysterical farce, rapacious but lovable producer Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) hasn't had a hit in years and resorts to fulfilling sexually crazed little old ladies' fantasies for extra cash. But when he meets his new meek, neurotic accountant, Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder), the two accidentally come up with a plot to oversell shares in a surefire flop musical and make off with the profits. The plan sends the new partners-in-crime on a search for the worst play ever: SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER, written by an ex-Nazi (Kenneth Mars) whose only friends are the filthy city pigeons he keeps on his roof. Inspired, manic performances by all involved, along with Brooks's lively direction--which affectionately alludes to such MGM Golden Age musicals as SINGIN' IN THE RAIN--make THE PRODUCERS both referential and highly original as it moves along swiftly to the ultimate musical climax.", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301797973", "630281622X", "6305576173", "6300247112"], "bought_together": ["6301797973"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 552537}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6305112878", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/215KFPD56ZL.jpg", "title": "Producers [VHS]"}
{"description": "Audrey Hepburn is the delightful young Sabrina, the daughter of a chauffeur who is hopelessly in love with David Larrabee (William Holden), the playboy younger son in the rich Long Island household her father works for. In order to help her forget her woes, Sabrina is shipped off to cooking school in Paris. While there, she befriends a baron who provides a bit of culture--and the encouragement to snip off her childlike ponytail. Upon her return to New York, Sabrina is transformed into a sophisticated woman, and David is entranced by her. However, his older brother Linus (Humphrey Bogart) has arranged David's marriage to Elizabeth Tyson in order to seal a business merger and thus must steer David away from Sabrina. To do this, Linus takes on the task of wooing her for himself. Full of great dialogue (\"A woman happy in love, she burns the souffl&eacute;; a woman unhappy in love, she forgets to turn on the oven\") and wonderful performances, this film is a romantic masterpiece.

{"description": "A little drunk on its own arcane exotica as a gambling movie,Roundersis a film that takes us inside a world of high-stakes card players but falls short on such essentials as character development, relationships, that sort of thing. Still, it is a real curiosity, written by a couple of guys (David Levien and Brian Koppelman) who appear to know something about the dark underbelly of card hustling for fun and profit. Matt Damon stars as a reluctant law student who can't put aside his subterranean career of playing poker and blackjack for big money. After he loses his post-grad nest egg to a weird Russian kingpin (John Malkovich)--and also loses his disgusted girlfriend (Gretchen Mol) in the process--Damon's character turns to an unreliable old buddy (Edward Norton) for a dangerous game of sharking wherever there happens to be a game underway: frat boys, cops, bad dudes, you name it. Norton appears to be living out every young actor's fantasy of re-creating Robert De Niro's prototypical head case in Martin Scorsese'sMean Streets, and while his performance is burdened by obvious quotation marks, his estimable talent still shines through. Damon's charm and intelligence bring some oomph to the curiously flat proceedings, and while his hushed, soul-bearing scenes with Martin Landau (as a law professor who takes a shine to the kid) seem gratuitous, they're still nice to watch. Behind all this is director John Dahl (Red Rock West), who is not exactly at the top of his game here but who brings his distinctive toughness to the crime-noir tone.--Tom Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 343634}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.18, "brand": "", "asin": "6305240655", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51565J9D9ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rounders [VHS]"}
{"description": "The sixthPink Panthercomedy was the last to star Peter Sellers (the following film in the series incorporated previously unseen footage), and it was also the last in the series to show any signs of genuine inspiration. It's a weak entry in thePantherpantheon, involving a rather mundane plot about a \"French Connection\" drug deal that leads Inspector Clouseau--presumed murdered and now sleuthing incognito--to Hong Kong for a brash, slapstick finale that almost compensates for the routine gags that precede it. Sellers and director Blake Edwards are coasting along smoothly here, and some of the gags pay off in well-earned laughs--particularly with a clever nod toDr.&nbsp;Strangelovewhen Clouseau dons a Toulouse-Lautrec costume. Another highlight finds Clouseau disguised as an old sea captain, complete with a leaky inflatable parrot (it looks more like a purple puffin) resting limply on his shoulder. But a later attempt to spoof Mafia kingpins is hardly up to snuff for a talent as original as Sellers, and Dyan Cannon lacks the comedic sensibility to make the most of her role as a druglord's vengeful ex-mistress. Some of the physical gags are amazingly elaborate, and it's still a riot to hear Sellers perfecting (or is that murdering?) his hilarious French accent, but while it's adequately enjoyable this movie makes you long for the glory days of thePink Pantherfranchise.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305308748", "B0009IW8OE", "B0009S4J3C", "B0009S4J3M", "B0009S4J32", "B004FPXMG0", "B001HUWQGS", "B000CCBCDK", "B0009S4J4G", "B00260HH1M", "B001IHJ988", "B00005JL0I", "B003NTUOGU", "B000FBH3V8", "B000055Y0X", "B00005RDRO", "B001LXIDUY", "B0009S4J28", "B00009MEKJ", "B00AJCUL1C", "B00005JKH9", "B0000CBY1C", "B000G6BLWE", "B0001AG01M", "B000NDEXPC", "B000UJ48VI", "B0001Y9YJ8", "B000RPCK24", "B001KEHAHQ", "B000063K2R", "B000G6BLQU", "B00AMSQBRQ", "B004EPZ00C", "B00007GZRI", "B00014NEX0", "B000CEXFBK", "B000G6BLYC", "B0009S4J2S", "B00D3LA6AW", "B00AEFXPYY", "B00005LOLC", "B000NDEXPM", "0792839064", "B00023P4R4", "B00AEBB9E6", "B0045HCJ9E", "B0007XBKPE", "B000RPCK1U", "B001R10BN2", "B00871C09S", "B00005JM20", "B00AEFXDO6", "B001HUWQEU", "0783231032", "B003AWRMCO", "B00005O3VC", "B00AEFY0KW", "B00004ZBVI", "B00005Q4D6", "B000M53GMW", "0767821467", "B0001906W2", "6304698607", "B0018E03CW", "B008M4C1DU", "B000CNFC4E", "B00008LDNZ", "B0016LFG5Q", "B00C3ALLFS", "B00077BPF0", "B004VUK91K", "B00005V9HW", "B00AEFXD1O", "B00004XPPC", "B00008MTY5", "B00H83EUQW", "B000HT3PF6", "B0050FXDDQ", "B001U6YI9M", "B000E6ESI0", "B00EOBB7RG", "B00005A06N", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B00005N5SB", "0783225946", "B00005JLX2", "B00BTYU3UI"], "bought_together": ["B0009IW8OE", "6305308748"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0009IW8OE", "6305308748", "B0009S4J3C", "B0001AG01M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 194964}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 17.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6305308721", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q1RZXFKQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Revenge of the Pink Panther"}
{"description": "Charlize Theron is the latest stunning blonde to be hanging around some big ape in a Hollywood movie, this one a remake of the 1949 semi-classic with echoes of the superiorKing Kong. Theron plays the daugher of an American researcher killed by poachers in Africa. The baby gorilla left in her care grows up to become a hugely tall and broad specimen named Joe, living in the mountains as a mostly unseen legend among people who live there. Along comes an eco-minded emissary (Bill Paxton) from a California sanctuary, who talks the jungle girl into providing safe haven for Joe at the L.A. facility. The transition is not without discomfort, but everything is aggravated via a conspiracy of poachers to get Joe into their own greedy hands. Director Ron Underwood (City Slickers) uses a combination of special-effects techniques to give Joe life and personality, and he succeeds quite effectively. The requisite giant-ape-goes-amok scenes are all in place--a couple of them pretty intense--as is a conclusion that finds the simian hero performing a stunning feat of escalation. Underwood attempts to give a little modern spin to some classic Hollywood conventions regarding wild hearts lost in civilization, and the results are pretty agreeable family fare.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CXQX", "0788809806", "B00001YX9H", "0788812181", "6305177473", "B000035Z2S", "0788805533", "B000035Z46", "0788812408", "6303929478", "B00000ICHA", "B000JTATHG", "B00005JKX3", "6304500831", "6305319138", "B00003CXHR", "B0000E32WB", "6305940932", "6304401736", "B00000ICHI", "B000063V8N", "6304501153", "6304290888", "B00004R99B", "B0002YLCHE", "B00005T7H6", "B00000IZ00", "078880782X", "B00000J2JA", "6300274608", "B00000I7Q3", "6304416415", "078880720X", "B00004R99N", "B00335EQ0E", "6304311834", "B00005RDVV", "B00016JF2W", "6303315305", "0788812440", "B000009CTR", "6304293968", "6304030959", "6302426200", "6304155972", "078881107X", "6303168957", "6304400225", "B00003CXWI", "6305942285", "B0000TG9Z6", "B00005B24W", "B000089G5P", "0788810677", "B00003CXQ6", "6304501668", "6303039456", "0788810995", "B00005JLR1", "B00020HAME", "B00004T2SI", "6302746590", "B000035Z4W", "6304089627", "6301106563"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXQX"], "also_viewed": ["6303983812", "6304089767", "6302526574", "6304100507", "155890641X", "6305326940", "0788812807", "B000035Z2S", "6305942285", "6302426200", "6305319138", "0788812181", "6305229449", "6304290888", "0788805533", "6304500831", "6302787068", "6300274195", "6304400551", "6303929338", "B00003CXHR", "6304401132", "B0007KTBIU", "B00005KAQI", "6304873441", "B00005RDVV", "6303314015", "6304978286", "6300275310", "078880782X", "B00004R99N", "6305177473", "B00005B24W", "0783222203", "6305870160", "B00003CXXI", "B00000GUNY", "6301991311", "B00001IVFU", "B00004REYY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 151214}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.84, "brand": "", "asin": "6305318867", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HB928CZEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mighty Joe Young  [VHS]"}
{"description": "Don't expect the blood-and-thunder adventure of Akira Kurosawa's samurai  tales in this take on the legendary 18th century story. Loyal samurai plot  righteous revenge on the scheming official responsible for the dishonor and  execution of their honorable samurai Lord, yet Kenji Mizoguchi's elegant epic is  a film of confrontation through ceremony, plots concealed in veils of political  feints, and vengeance patiently delayed until honor can be satisfied. Such  introspective drama may frustrate viewers anticipating adrenaline-fueled  combat--even the climactic battle is communicated entirely in the breathless reading of  a gripping dispatch--and they might prefer Hiroshi Inagaki's more visceral 1962Chushingura. The drama of Mizoguchi's film is in the restrained poise of  warriors reigning in their instinct to attack, the arched eyebrows of cunning  politicians playing games of brinkmanship over tea, and the flowing camerawork  and measured pacing of Mizoguchi's handsome style.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B000WEH74G", "B001PCNZJU", "B00HEPDGKA", "B000056NWP", "B000PHW2PO", "B00EZY9Q0W", "B007N5YK10", "B000AQKUD6", "B000K0YM0Y", "B001CW7ZTE", "B000NOK0H6", "B004SXSRS2", "B00687XNNK", "B00CEIOHPU", "B004XQO8MS", "B000G8NXYG", "B001L28H10", "B0009WIE2A", "B00008RH1H", "B001BEK8E2", "B00HE01030", "4805312033", "B000BB14YY", "B00006IUI5", "B005JJCMN0", "B000K0YLZ0", "B00B2BYXSQ", "1907960082", "B004W4UKSC", "B00005B1ZL", "B000FDECGA", "B0000A2ZNX", "B004GFGUEK", "B00065GX0K", "B000BQ5J18", "B0006N0E4S", "B000BB14I0", "B008Y5OXDI", "B00005JLEJ", "B000HEWGTW", "1595829547", "B001C93UNW", "B000N3SU2O", "B00A8QDI3M", "156836427X", "4903759067", "B002EX9X9U", "B0000XB5OC", "B008Y5OWSO", "B009V8EG7U", "B00H9L26AA", "B00GQQ75QO", "B00HWWUQWQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000WEH74G", "B001PCNZJU", "B00HEPDGKA", "B000056NWP"]}, "price": 19.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 303162}, "asin": "6305339708", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KTW83ERAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The 47 Ronin: Parts 1 &amp; 2"}

{"description": "It seems almost inconceivable that a film as great asLost  Horizonwould be nearly lost to the ravages of age and studio neglect.  Fortunately,  Columbia has compensated for past misdeeds with this superlative DVD release, which restores Capra's classic to near-complete form and provides a thorough--and thoroughly fascinating--account of the film's production and eventual restoration. Of particular interest to film buffs will be the engaging photo essay and accompanying narration by film historian Kendall Miller, whose affectionate (and infectious) obsession withLost Horizonis expressed here for the benefit of posterity. Equally engrossing is the full-length restoration commentary by UCLA film preservation expert Robert Gitt, whose efforts to restore this film were nothing less than heroic. Unfortunately, Gitt is teamed in the commentary with retiredLos Angeles Timesfilm critic Charles Champlin, whose contribution is amiable but superfluous. That quibble aside, this edition ofLost Horizonis one of the most rewarding DVDs of any classic Hollywood film. Although several of Frank Capra's other films have achieved a higher profile,Lost Horizonjust gets better as the years go by, and with its wealth of supplemental features, this DVD is a definitive archival tribute.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005KR6O1C", "B000GRUQL0", "8087888057", "B0006B2AA6", "B008D19ZPY", "B000KJU13C", "B0007PALVQ", "B00EOBB866", "B000083C8K", "B001GLX6US", "0895773619", "B0000714AT", "B000002ZBR", "B00049QQJQ", "B000BYA4HO", "B000083C6R", "B0043GAT5I", "B00KIZY3XW", "B001BSBBDK", "B000OHBCI8", "B00AATUZQA", "B00011D1OU", "B004P8R9OS", "B000ION7A8", "B00BGGITZU", "B00005JKFR", "B0049985XW", "B003NN9ZCK", "B001BSBBIA", "B0002B15RE", "B00006RCO3", "B0011WN03K", "B0006B2A7E", "B000FVQLLQ", "B000A9QK8M", "B0087ZG7OI", "B0039R18WU", "0783229488", "B000KX0IOU", "B000BITV92", "B00008LDNZ", "B000E6ESXK", "B00AEBB8VK", "B000CEV3L4", "B000F7CMQI", "B000085EFE", "B003MJZ07E", "B000HT3PGK", "B00KIZY0EE", "B00000CQJZ", "B001D8W7EU", "B006TTC5A4", "B0007TKNJ2", "B001GLX6UI", "8087830865", "B001GLX6TY", "B0035ECHIG", "B000FVQLKW", "B000BYA4II", "B001BSBBIK", "B000EU1Q1S", "B00005JMR7", "B000E1MXSW", "B000CNESN0", "B0007TKNH4", "B005E7SFAQ", "B00006RCO2", "B006FE83UE", "B00DZP1C9K", "B0000549B0", "B0033PSH7M", "B003YY2886", "B000244EYW", "B00A33J8U2", "B001SMC9L2", "B004DK9DQ0", "B000OFOJ30", "B00004RFHN", "B000A0GOF0", "B000KGGJ1I", "B0045HCJHG", "B0009S4IH4", "B00AEBB97S", "B0045HCJ9E", "B002GSXKQA", "B0045HCJQW", "B005OT7YX8", "B001GUYAZY", "B00AJCUL0I", "B000KJU13M", "B005ZVIN30", "B000NJXG68", "B00AEFXD1O", "B00000F17E", "B000069HYF", "B0002B15Y2", "B00008LDO1", "B000LC4ZD0", "B000B7MX6Q", "B0047BXR1C"], "bought_together": ["B005KR6O1C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005KR6O1C", "B0006B2AA6", "B000GRUQL0", "8087888057"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9024}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.05, "brand": "Unknown", "asin": "6305416222", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51esGDjolTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lost Horizon"}

{"description": "There's Something About Maryis one of the funniest movies in years, recalling the days of the Zucker-Abraham-Zucker movies, in which (often tasteless) gags were piled on at a fierce rate.

WithMary, they've created a consistently hilarious romantic comedy, made all the funnier by the fact that you know that they know that some of their gags go way over the line.Cameron Diaz stars as Mary, every guy's ideal. Ben Stiller plays a high-school suitor still hung up on Mary years later; the obstacles standing between him and her include a number of psychotic suitors, a miserable little pooch, and, oh yeah, a murder charge.The Farrellys' admittedly simplistic camera work, which adapts easily to a TV screen, and the fact that you'll likely laugh yourself so silly over certain scenes you'll want to replay them to see what you were missing while you were busy convulsing, make this a perfect video movie.--David Kronke", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300214567"], "also_viewed": ["B00004YZEG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 467528}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.01, "brand": "", "asin": "6305499071", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41T5QB162RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "There's Something About Mary (Special Edition) [VHS]"}
{"description": "This first DVD volume of episodes from the originalStar Trekbegins with a show that saved the series even before it launched. \"Where No Man Has Gone Before\" was actually the secondTrekpilot produced by  Gene Roddenberry after NBC rejected \"The Cage\" (now a subject of cult  fascination). A retooled cast now included William Shatner as Captain James&nbsp;R. Kirk (the middle initialTcame later), Leonard Nimoy as  Mr. Spock,  George Takei as Ensign Sulu, and James Doohan as Chief Engineer Montgomery  Scott. (DeForest Kelley, Nichelle Nichols, and Walter Koenig signed on in  subsequent episodes.) A lot of thought went into scriptwriter Samuel&nbsp;L.  Peeples's story about a crewman named Gary Mitchell (Gary Lockwood) who has a  close relationship with Kirk and some natural ESP abilities. When theEnterpriseapproaches an energy barrier at the edge of the galaxy,  Mitchell metamorphoses into a godlike being with silver eyes, awesome psychic  abilities, and a rapidly developing ego. As Mitchell becomes an increasing  threat to the ship, Kirk is faced with making a terrible choice to save his crew.The episode locked in the very character and themes ofStar Trek:  science fiction stories told in mortal terms, the conflict between  relationships and duty, and a strong emphasis on exploring personalities.  Lockwood's disciplined, modulated performance was a big plus. (He went on, of  course, to play astronaut Frank Poole in2001: A Space Odyssey.)The second show in this volume was the tenth to air, \"The Corbomite  Maneuver.\" While exploring an uncharted region of the galaxy, theEnterpriseencounters a cube-shaped alien probe (a predecessor of Borg vessels?) that  Kirk promptly destroys. That action brings the wrath of a spaceship called  theFesarius, which locks theEnterprisein a tractor beam from  which it  can't escape. The show is perhaps best known for something of a surprise  ending when the \"captain\" of theFesarius(played by Clint Howard,  brother of Ron and child star of TV'sGentle Ben) is revealed.

{"description": "\"I have a bad feeling about this,\" says the young Obi-Wan Kenobi  (played by Ewan McGregor) inStar Wars: Episode I, The Phantom  Menaceas he steps off a spaceship and into the most anticipated cinematic event... well, ever. He might as well be speaking for the  legions of fans of the original episodes in theStar Warssaga  who can't help but secretly ask themselves: Sure, this isStar  Wars, but is itmy Star Wars? The original elevated  moviegoers' expectations so high that it would have been impossible for  any subsequent film to meet them. And as with all theStar Warsmovies,The Phantom Menacefeatures inexplicable plot twists, a  fistful of loose threads, and some cheek-chewing dialogue. Han Solo's  swagger is sorely missed, as is the pervading menace of heavy-breathing  Darth Vader. There is still way too much quasi-mystical mumbo jumbo,  and some of what was fresh aboutStar Wars22 years earlier  feels formulaic. Yet there's much to admire. The special effects are  stupendous; three worlds are populated with a m&eacute;lange of creatures, flora, and horizons rendered in absolute  detail. The action and battle scenes are breathtaking in their  complexity. And one particular sequence of the film--the  adrenaline-infused pod race through the Tatooine desert--makes the chariot race inBen-Hurlook like a Sunday stroll through the park.Among the host of new characters, there are a few familiar walk-ons. We  witness the first meeting between R2-D2 and C-3PO, Jabba the Hutt looks  younger and slimmer (but not young and slim), and Yoda is as crabby as  ever. Natalie Portman's stately Queen Amidala sports hairdos that make  Princess Leia look dowdy and wields a mean laser. We never bond with  Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson), and Obi-Wan's day is yet to come. Jar Jar Binks, a cross  between a Muppet, a frog, and a hippie, provides many of the movie's lighter moments, while Sith Lord Darth  Maul is a formidable force. Baby-faced Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) looks too young  and innocent to command the powers of the Force or wield a lightsaber (much less transmute into the future Darth Vader), but his  boyish exuberance wins over skeptics.Near the end of the movie, Palpatine, the new leader of the Republic,  may be speaking for fans eagerly awaitingEpisode IIwhen he  pats young Anakin on the head and says, \"We will watch your career with  great interest.\" Indeed! --Tod Nelson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000633ZP", "6301792734", "B00005JLXH", "B00006HBUJ", "6304539258", "6304539274", "6301792769", "B000FQVX78", "6304539290", "0792158261", "B000FQJAJG", "6304117752", "0767729307", "B001GQSY5K", "6304178352", "B000FAGGWQ", "B00BBND56G", "B000FQJAIW", "B00005LL26", "B00003CXCT", "B00003CXI0", "B002I9Z8AS", "B00006AL1C", "B00CFWWDWE", "B000066HAS", "B000001ON6", "B000MUANT6", "6305587159"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLXH", "B00006HBUJ"], "also_viewed": ["B00006HBUJ", "B00005JLXH", "B00E9PMML2", "B0000633ZP", "6301792734", "B00BBND56G", "6304539258", "6301792769", "6304539274", "B00006JDUE", "0767729307", "B00E9PMMX0", "B000FQJAIW", "B000FQVX78", "B000FQJAJG", "B00000IQMT", "B000FAGGWQ", "B003ZSJ212", "0345434110", "6303148352", "6304089767", "0439834775", "6304117752", "B00BUZW14M", "6304500831", "0590010891", "0345341465", "6304434340", "B001GQSY5K", "155890641X", "B00005LL26", "6302961572", "0792151712", "B003W77SEO", "B000M4Y8JI", "0767825411", "B00003CXXI", "B00000IZ8A", "B00169IZN8", "6302787068", "B00006G8LB", "080010367X", "0800125762", "6302091632", "0792158261", "B000850IS6", "6300214826", "6303506291", "B00005V1Z8", "B000641D2Y", "0784011923", "B00008Y47S", "6300214060", "630382790X", "B00003CXI0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 79460}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.44, "brand": "Star Wars", "asin": "630575067X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41SJPKK4S4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Wars - Episode I, The Phantom Menace [VHS]"}

{"description": "Gun Shyhad the misfortune to come along after several other \"killer pursues therapy\" movies/TV shows (Grosse Pointe Blank,Analyze This,The Sopranos); in this case, it's a DEA agent and not a Mafioso, but that wasn't enough to keep it from getting swept aside. Liam Neeson (Schindler's List,Rob Roy) plays Charlie, a government undercover agent whose last mission got botched, resulting in his partner's death. But the DEA isn't willing to let him get out early; clinging to his fantasy of a seaside retirement home, Charlie agrees to one more mission, even though he's convinced that the New York City gangster he's investigating will kill him. On his flight to the city, he meets a psychiatrist who encourages him to join a group therapy session. Meanwhile, it turns out that the gangster Fulvio, played by busy character actor Oliver Platt (Funny Bones,Bulworth), is equally miserable with his career. Curiously, Neeson and Platt both seem initially miscast--Neeson exudes a solid imperturbability, and Platt comes off as too soft to be really threatening--but over the course of the movie, their performances become increasingly compelling, perhaps because they are cast against type. Their neuroses, which initially seem like weak gags, start feeling genuine and sad.Gun Shyis marketed as a comedy, but its strength is in the truth of its characters. Sandra Bullock (who also produced the film) has a small role as a gastroenterologist with whom Charlie falls in love.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305736685", "B000M341SC", "B00066FB2A", "B00465I16K", "B0002IQLHQ", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B0000640RY", "B00000JGHN", "B000CEV3M8", "0783235380", "B00068GTK6", "B002SYAGNC", "B000058TLQ", "B000GB5M3S", "B0077ATSSQ", "B0045HCJGC", "B000CCBCHG", "B003498SCQ", "B00008G6E8", "B00FQRZ6EM", "B003M785HS", "B003IY498Y", "B002NZK5VO", "B00IARA8KM", "B00004UEDQ", "B0006GANOQ", "B0001GF24M", "B004A8ZX28", "B003L20IG0", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B00JA3RVG4", "B000EXDRLW", "B0000AYGBF", "B000A3XY5A", "B00441GZ46", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B002NZK5RS", "B00030WW4Y", "B002NZK5V4", "B00JL6L4UY", "B00AIBZMD6", "B005FH1RRI", "B00KM9LY3Q", "B00JU949TK", "B0002235QW", "B000QGDY0G", "B002NTDXQ4", "B00J5G1P2W", "079283366X", "6304765266", "B005LAIGRS", "B0007PALGG", "B000P6R5RK", "B002OVED88", "B00008L3UM", "B002ZG994U", "B00HF98SPS", "B00066FB52", "B000HEWEE4", "B00E8RKHWW", "B00HWWUR02", "B00J5JSV3A", "B000065K2V", "B008JFURII", "B00HEPE6MM", "B00008NRI7", "B008E70EES", "B00006ZXSQ", "B000BVM1S2", "B0037QGS0A", "B005NKIPUY", "0783237413", "B00CX7TOOG", "B002DU39GW", "B000046PUQ", "0767810872", "B004OB2EYQ", "B00015YVDG", "B002K0WBXW", "6305133409", "B003PIUIJC", "1558908382", "B000N4SHOO", "B00E44EZUE", "B00FFT1AZK", "B005LAIIRQ", "B00H1RMWYW", "B00DX88IKK", "B008JFUPPI", "6305822581", "B007C4ZJ0S", "B00HEPDGKA", "B0077ATSZE", "B000F7CMRM", "B0068MNO2U", "B00002E23C", "B002AS464Q", "B002ZG984Q", "B001KO1BCQ", "B004D9ADD8"], "bought_together": ["B000M341SC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AQ5905U", "B000M341SC", "B000CEV3M8", "6305736685"]}, "price": 7.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 94754}, "asin": "6305874867", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ADTC6E1BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gun Shy"}

{"description": "Pixar genius reigns in this funny romantic comedy, which stars a robot who says absolutely nothing for a full 25 minutes yet somehow completely transfixes and endears himself to the audience within the first few minutes of the film. As the last robot left on earth, Wall-E (voiced by Ben Burtt) is one small robot--with a big, big heart--who holds the future of earth and mankind squarely in the palm of his metal hand. He's outlasted all the \"Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class\" robots that were assigned some 700 years ago to clean up the environmental mess that man made of earth while man vacationed aboard the luxury spaceship Axiom. Wall-E has dutifully gone about his job compacting trash, the extreme solitude broken only by his pet cockroach, but he's developed some oddly human habits and ideas. When the Axiom sends its regularly scheduled robotic EVE probe (Elissa Knight) to earth, Wall-E is instantly smitten and proceeds to try to impress EVE with his collection of human memorabilia. EVE's directive compels her to bring Wall-E's newly collected plant sprout to the captain of the Axiom and Wall-E follows in hot pursuit. Suddenly, the human world is turned upside down and the Captain (Jeff Garlin) joins forces with Wall-E and a cast of other misfit robots to lead the now lethargic people back home to earth. Wall-E is a great family film with the most impressive aspect being the depth of emotion conveyed by a simple robot--a machine typically considered devoid of emotion, but made so absolutely touching by the magic of Pixar animation. Also well-worth admiring are the sweeping views from space, the creative yet disturbing vision of what strange luxuries a future space vacation might offer, and the innovative use of trash in a future cityscape. Underneath the slapstick comedy and touching love story is a poignant message about the folly of human greed and its potential effects on earth and the entire human race.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000VBJEEG", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00007LVCM", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B00AFEX83C", "0736424229", "B00005JN4W", "B00005JNQS", "B0042U94UQ", "B00E9ZATJO", "B001OMU6UM", "B00005JNS0", "B0030IIZ4M", "B0034JKZ86", "B002ZG97YM", "B002WJI2QQ", "B004HO6I4M", "B008YWY0HK", "B0012EM5D8", "B0006UEVT0", "B009SZCC9U", "B004G600A4", "B00AAXFYPI", "B00F522C7C", "B008Z1LBU4", "B00CTNYLQA", "B003H9M1Q2", "B000AAF1TU", "B008JFUQ16", "B000ROAK2W", "B000AY74OG", "B00275EHJG", "B00CWM58WY", "B00009M9BK", "B00EV1YZ96", "B001DPHDCY", "B000MV9026", "B001O5LVPI", "0783231474", "B00CQRN3QI", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00I6JOD2S", "B001HN6922", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B0087F7VSY", "B001U2MQE0", "B0030IIYYS", "B00A83075M", "B00H4Z07Q6", "B005LAIH4A", "B000DWMYQ8", "B00CHVJODE", "B0000AOX0O", "B003UESJF6", "B00JK531ES", "B00HLTD2OE", "B0001I561E", "B00BGYO7HG", "B003ZHVJGO", "B001ILFUD2", "B0002YLCOM", "B0039N74CW", "B00004U9WQ", "B00937R6QC", "B00CUDD0C0", "B004EPZ034", "B00004R99S", "B00003CXB4", "B000065V42", "B00005RDSQ", "B004ZBACOE", "B001GCUO7A", "B00AO686JC", "B000AAF1U4", "B0006JMLRK", "B00005JMQZ", "B0043X1FOK", "B00C7JGDBW", "B001JRB17Y", "B001KVZ6G6", "B00005TN8K", "B00005JMFH", "B00E9ZATKI", "B001ILFUDC", "B000V1Y44G", "B00003CX8Y", "B0011U52E2", "B00EBBGLFC", "B000YERP2S", "B00009YXAW", "B00003CXCQ", "B002NZK5SW", "B000G75AZC", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B0084IHVGG", "B00947N6D8", "B004LWZW7Y"], "bought_together": ["B001KVZ6FW", "B000VBJEEG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004HO6I4M", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00I6JOD2S", "B00005JN4W"]}, "price": 17.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 319062}, "asin": "7883706837", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51u-jDIxUZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)"}
{"description": "Generally acknowledged as a bona fide classic, this Francis Ford Coppola film is one of those rare experiences that feels perfectly right from beginning to end--almost as if everyone involved had been born to participate in it. Based on Mario Puzo's bestselling novel about a Mafia dynasty, Coppola'sGodfatherextracted and enhanced the most universal themes of immigrant experience in America: the plotting-out of hopes and dreams for one's successors, the raising of children to carry on the good work, etc. In the midst of generational strife during the Vietnam years, the film somehow struck a chord with a nation fascinated by the metamorphosis of a rebellious son (Al Pacino) into the keeper of his father's dream.

{"description": "Hidden throughoutCach&#xE9;is the sense that you should be watching every moment in this film closely, just as the protagonists are themselves being watched by someone unknown. Georges and Anne Laurent&#x92;s (Daniel Auteuil and Juliette Binoche) enviable lives are terrorized by the sudden arrival on their doorstep of a videotaped recording of their Parisian townhouse. It&#x92;s nothing but a long, unedited shot of the fa&#xE7;ade of their house, but it&#x92;s disturbing nonetheless. Soon another arrives, this time of the farmhouse Georges grew up in, and then another of a car driving down a suburban street, and a walk down a hallway to a low-rent apartment. Again the videos are benign but unsettling. Then the mystery becomes more threatening when they receive gruesome postcards depicting child-like drawings of bloody, dead stick figures. Georges believes he knows who the culprit is, but for reasons all his own  refuses to let his wife in on the secret. Clearly more is hidden here than just the identity of their stalker. InCach&#xE9;, writer and director Michael Haneke skillfully, methodically pulls back multiple layers of deception, like new skin being pulled off an old wound. he masterfully fuses elements of his predecessors to create a film that is haunting and memorable. There is Bergman's fascination with the complexity of relationships, the suspense and lurking danger of Hitchcock, and the unique cinematic sensibility of Antonioni. In fact, the provocative final shot is practically a tribute toThe Passenger--a lot of people will want to rewatch it many times to see what they can find in it (if, after watching it, you are still unsatisfied with the resolution, then watch the interview with Haneke in the DVD's special features for his insights). It's a film of great effect and intrigue. There are no easy resolutions, and the answers given in this mystery will only lead to more questions.--Daniel Vancini", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002BWP4A6", "B00006LPER", "B000SIWHAK", "B00386OWUC", "B00187FPC2", "B00062134E", "B000068MAL", "6305228876", "B0002DB52M", "B00AIBZLHS", "B002BWP3UC", "B000OVLBGC", "B000B9EYFW", "B002AG2NTI", "B0057GYODG", "B00005N89H", "B0036TGSJE", "B000G0O5IM", "B000MTEFP0", "B00092ZLEY", "B0012QE4PI", "B0019UGYAU", "B00005N8A9", "B00023P4N8", "B0007Z0NYQ", "B0001EFUFK", "B000EHQU3A", "B002VKB0M4", "B00151QYE4", "B00005JKJA", "B000N4SHOO", "B00HVOFP6W", "B00AIBZLR8", "B005KQVE1S", "B00K0MM4AM", "B004WPYO7E", "B00HE011DE", "B006KH6CF4", "B000N3T0DW", "B00008976W", "B0007OCG5G", "B000059HA5", "B000083C5F", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B00018D40O", "B002VECLXC", "B00AX7PGQS", "B003VA3JTA", "B00005QAPJ", "B00005OSLQ", "B003Y5H4R0", "B00HT2RTU6", "6305744114", "B00005K9O8", "B00429MM1K", "B002P7UCJK", "080215056X", "B000E5LEV0", "B00009W0U4", "B000EHQU30", "B000BRBA8S", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B00IGK6TH4", "B00005JLQW", "B0007GAG42", "B00000K3TS", "B00K72HVBC", "B00005NFZC", "B000HIVIQU", "B000N6TX1I", "B000OCY7JE", "B007A9EGG8", "B001CIOCLC", "B00AEBB89W", "B000N2HBIO", "B00CQ8HCSM", "B000EQ5V2C", "B000E6EGT6", "B000934FC2", "B0087IT8FK", "B002BWP3UM", "B0006Z2NCM", "B00GRA7M2G", "B00ATK015K", "6305999872", "B001AZJKKK", "B000GBEWNY", "B000GBEWPC", "B00F6SHGF8", "B00008976Y", "B000FVQM2Y", "B00H4IR3JC", "B004ODLUIU", "B0006IUE9I", "B004YCKKH8", "B00455JE58", "B002ZG4Q66", "B0081HLM2E", "B00AEFXN9G", "B0024FAG2Q"], "bought_together": ["B002BWP4A6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002BWP4A6", "B00187FPC2", "B0036TGSJE", "B00006LPER"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17815}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.28, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00000F7E6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41CS99VVAKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cache (Hidden)"}

{"description": "Considered by many to represent a low point in Steven Spielberg's  career,  1990'sAlwaysdid suggest something of a temporary drift in the  director's sensibility. A remake of the  classic Spencer Tracy filmA Guy Named Joe,Alwaysstars  Richard Dreyfuss as a Forest Service pilot who takes great risks with his own  life to douse wildfires from a plane. After promising his frightened fianc&eacute;e  (Holly Hunter) to keep his feet on the ground and go into teaching,  Dreyfuss's character is killed during one last flight. But his spirit wanders  restlessly, hopelessly attached to and possessive of Hunter, who can't see or  hear him. Then the real conflict begins: a trainee pilot (Brad Johnson), a  likable doofus, begins wooing a not-unappreciative Hunter--and it becomes  Dreyfuss's heavenly mandate to accept, and even assist in, their budding  romance. The trouble with the film is a certain airlessness, a  hyper-inventiveness in every scene and sequence that screams of Spielberg's self-education in Hollywood classicism. Unlike the masters he is constantly quoting and emulating inAlways, he forgets to back off and let the  movie breathe on its own sometimes, which would better serve his clockwork  orchestration of suspense and comedy elsewhere. Still, there are lovely  passages in this film, such as the unforgettable look on Dreyfuss's face a  half-second before fate claims him. John Goodman contributes good supporting  work, and Audrey Hepburn makes her final screen appearance as an angel.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002GHHHNI", "630471193X", "B00004W46I", "6305428352", "B00CVB6XZM", "B002GOAGZC", "B0045HCJ76", "0783230079", "B00AEFY4CG", "B000NA1WDQ", "B00028HBIE", "B0007ZEOD2", "B00008438W", "B002GHHHP6", "630542845X", "B000E1MXSW", "B0045HCIY0", "B000EHRVOW", "B004IK30KA", "B002GHHHPQ", "B000GI3RMY", "0783231032", "B003ASLJK4", "B00023P4QK", "B0039QPVRY", "B007JNR4WI", "B00005JMYC", "B005FQ2H8W", "0767818105", "B0045HCJRQ", "6305213283", "0783227396", "B00AEFXYOA", "B00005JL6M", "B00AEFYIH2", "B003L16F7C", "B00000IQV7", "B00000IQC2", "B002O3Z50G", "B004SIP8JI", "B002GHHHHO", "B001DB6J6Y", "B001R23GBU", "0783226810", "B000H6SXS8", "B00007GZR5", "B00AEFY7NM", "B002NZK5TQ", "B00347AIS0", "B000Y11BBW", "B00DDT0JB0", "B00003CXHG", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B00008G8M4", "B00005T7HZ", "B00D6I7IYY", "B00008PX7J", "6305428506", "6305236569", "B006TTC5B8", "B002O3Z4WU", "6305144168", "B0006FYOTC", "B00009NHC5", "0783225733", "B00006JU7S", "B00005KAQP", "B002GHHHKQ", "B001ECDVJU", "B00003CWU3", "B004KPLVYA", "B0002B15YM", "B0001CNRBG", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00000G3PA", "B000MQC9H4", "078322740X", "6305212112", "B0088XQC4O", "0788815466", "6305128952", "B00DNF1RM4", "B000765IJK", "B0009UZG3C", "B0000JBALO", "B0087ZG7NO"], "bought_together": ["B002GHHHNI", "B00004W46I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002GOAGZC", "B00004W46I", "630471193X", "B002GHHHNI"]}, "price": 6.66, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2309}, "asin": "B00000IQW5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FKVTBYN6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Always"}
{"description": "Directors Sidney Lumet, Alan J. Pakula, Sydney Pollack, and Norman  Jewison astutely documented the political pulse of  the '60s and '70s with such films asPrince of the City,The Parallax View,Three Days of the Condor, andIn the Heat of the Night. Lumet and Jewison have  carried their cinematic social consciousness into their past two decades of filmmaking as well.In Country(1989) is Jewison's mournful look at one  American family's struggle to survive the aftermath of Vietnam. The film is based on Bobbie Ann Mason'sbookand it was Bruce Willis's first effort to  break out of hisMoonlightingandDie Hardmold by tackling the dramatically  dark role of Emmett, a Vietnam veteran whose flashbacks of battle horror  have pushed him into isolation from the world. His niece, Samantha (Emily Lloyd),  lost her dad in the war, and these two unlikely people form a bond based on a  past Emmett can't escape and a future that looms bright and beautiful for  Samantha. What Jewison does best is evoke the sense of hope that was once held by the  forgotten survivors of that terrible war.In  Countryambitiously struggles to pull all of its threads together, and while this is a wonderful character study, it has a messy, meandering  structure that never quite gels or answers the  questions it poses. Yet there's no denying that the climactic closing scenes  have a poignancy and power that will bring tears to anyone watching.--Paula Nechak", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004BVS2BI", "B007HCI42A", "B0007TKNDI", "B000077VQJ", "B0015D20FE", "B0043X1FLI", "0767821513", "0767807588", "B0052SO0PQ", "B005R08HJY", "0767817761", "0767815122", "B00AEBB86U", "B0058ZPNBI", "B00CLH09UQ", "B000095WW8", "B009HIKAN8", "6305428484", "B00005JP3T", "0783240198", "6304698747", "B00004ZBVG", "B000ELL1R6", "B0027VK15Y", "B00IKM5OCO", "B0014CKCEC", "B00CHYSSME", "B001ULAUF8", "B0036U6YTC", "B0002V7ON8", "B000FFL2G6", "B00AEBBA36", "B000MRA542", "0060835176", "B000FEWNBU", "6305225788", "B000066C6J", "B004X60QRE", "B00008R9M6", "0790742446", "B000068QPV", "B000B8QG22", "B00AG51V8E", "B00005OSJQ", "B00JU949TK", "B002AS466O", "B00D3XM7H0", "B00BTYRB58", "B00C2535TE", "B002OGMGV4", "B000FZETR0", "B000WMA6R8", "B006TTC5HC", "B00004TCKI", "B000XT1P4S", "B002ZG97RE", "B00005ASGB", "B000E5N6KW", "B00562I40K", "B00HWWUR02", "B002KQD66C", "B008JFUNKU", "6305081832", "B000FKO5QK", "B003EYEEI8", "B00772M1D8", "B00005QCVU", "B004FGA2IA", "B0002J4X2K", "B00005JKTP", "B000BXJ1XS", "B003XMKUES", "B00AEFXLKC", "B0007PALZ2", "B00803PFZO", "B00005V4XW", "B009XTF8NI", "B004P7CMVE", "B002ZG96ZC", "B004U7EIES", "B00008CMT3", "079284646X", "B00005PJ8T", "B00DC6HWRI", "B00J11U54K", "B00HEPE6MM", "B00J2MPZQG", "B00008J2PG", "B000MGB6NM", "B00DL48BM6", "B0041ONFEO", "B000JJSJS2", "B003AWRMCO", "B005BSCPY0", "B000EHSVW8", "B003ASLJOU", "B000EWBKLM", "B0000524E4", "B00HOGBXS6", "B002UZCJ8Y"], "bought_together": ["B004BVS2BI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007HCI42A", "B000ELL1R6", "B00005V4XW", "B000077VQJ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 71446}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00000JGHU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VX70Q0BEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "In Country"}
{"description": "You don't fool with Mother Nature, spit into the wind, remakeCasablanca, or trash the land of Oz. Perhaps that is why the 1985 live-action sequel split critics and audiences alike. The 1939 classic musical is so beloved that it's almost impossible to imagine seeing Dorothy in shock therapy, a crumbled yellow brick road, the ruins of Emerald City, and the Tin Man turned into stone. But L. Frank Baum, the author of the originalOzbooks, portrayed just that with his continuing stories of Dorothy. When you get by these tough facts, the film version is solid entertainment for the over-7 set.Dorothy (a 10-year-old Fairuza Balk in her debut) is back in Kansas, where Aunt Em (Piper Laurie) is at the end of her rope: her niece is not sleeping and going on about a place called Oz. Therapy may be the answer, but luckily the scary clinic goes dark before Dorothy can be, er, cured (but the lead-up will scare the munchkins out of most kids). She wakes up in the land of Oz, now in tatters, and searches for its king, the Scarecrow. A new set of friends, including a tin soldier, a talking chicken, and a pumpkin man, help her against new villains, including Princess Mombi (Jean Marsh)--complete with a set of detachable heads--and the evil Nome King (Nicol Williamson with a great assist from Will Vinton's Claymation). The sole directorial effort of Oscar-winning editor Walter Murch is stuffed with marvelous effects that foreshadow later works by Tim Burton and the Henson non-Muppet films.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302642256", "6304978286", "B00000JPH5", "0764005685", "6303212395", "B00000JPH4", "B000JYIZAY", "6304340648", "B00005OLY5"], "also_viewed": ["B006VJ1AAI", "B00I6JOBTI"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 193659}, "asin": "B00000JMQC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71DA4FZHGZL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Return to Oz [VHS]"}

{"description": "Hong Kongwuxiafilms, or martial arts fantasies, traditionally squeeze poor acting, slapstick humor, and silly story lines between elaborate fight scenes in which characters can literally fly.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragonhas no shortage of breathtaking battles, but it also has the dramatic soul of a Greek tragedy and the sweep of an epic romance. This is the work of director Ang Lee, who fell in love with movies while watchingwuxiafilms as a youngster and madeCrouching Tigeras a tribute to the form. To elevate the genre above its B-movie roots and broaden its appeal, Lee did two important things. First, he assembled an all-star lineup of talent, joining the famous Asian actors Chow Yun-fat and Michelle Yeoh with the striking, charismatic newcomer Zhang Ziyi. Behind the scenes, Lee called upon cinematographer Peter Pau (The Killer,The Bride with White Hair) and legendary fight choreographer Yuen Wo-ping, best known outside Asia for his work onThe Matrix. Second, in adapting the story from a Chinese pulp-fiction novel written by Wang Du Lu, Lee focused not on the pursuit of a legendary sword known as \"The Green Destiny,\" but instead on the struggles of his female leads against social obligation. In his hands, the requisite fight scenes become another means of expressing the individual spirits of his characters and their conflicts with society and each other.The filming required an immense effort from all involved. Chow and Yeoh had to learn to speak Mandarin, which Lee insisted on using instead of Cantonese to achieve a more classic, lyrical feel. The astonishing battles between Jen (Zhang) and Yu Shu Lien (Yeoh) on the rooftops and Jen and Li Mu Bai (Chow) atop the branches of bamboo trees required weeks of excruciating wire and harness work (which in turn required meticulous \"digital wire removal\"). But the result is a seamless blend of action, romance, and social commentary in a populist film that, like its young star Zhang, soars with balletic grace and dignity.--Eugene Wei", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007QS27K"], "also_viewed": ["B0007Q6VXC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 367958}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.95, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXR3", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G39T50SDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]"}
{"description": "To callPearl Harbora throwback to old-time war movies is something of an understatement. Director Michael Bay's epic take on the bombing that brought the United States into World War II hijacks every war movie situation and clich&#xE9; (some affectionate, some stale) you've ever seen and gives them a shiny, glossy spin until the whole movie practically gleams. Planes glisten, water sparkles, trees beckon--and Bay's re-creation of the bombing itself, a 30-minute sequence that's tightly choreographed and amazingly photographed, sets the action movie bar up quite a few notches. And in updating the classic war film, Bay and screenwriter Randall Wallace (Braveheart) use that old plot standby, the love triangle--this time, it's between two pilots (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) and a nurse (Kate Beckinsale) who find themselves stationed at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, during what they thought would be a nice, sunny tour of duty. Then, of course, history intervened.For the first 90 minutes of the movie, Affleck and Beckinsale find a nice, appealing chemistry that plays on his strengths as a movie star and hers as a serious actress--he gives her glamour, she gives him smarts. Their truncated romance--the beginning of which is told in flashback so we can get right to the point where he has to leave her to go to England--works, thanks to their charm. They're no Kate and Leo fromTitanic(a strategy the film strives hard toward), but they're pretty darn adorable in their own right. Hartnett, as the not entirely unwelcome third wheel, squints bravely but makes only a slight dent in the film. Everyone else inPearl Harbor--from Cuba Gooding Jr.'s brave navy seaman to Jon Voight's able impersonation of FDR--is pretty much a glorified walk-on, taking a backseat to the pyrotechnics and action sequences that keep the three-hour film in fairly constant motion. But when that action does take hold,Pearl Harboris quite a thrilling ride.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792151712", "B000059HGY", "B00000K3AN", "B00AEBBA36", "0792133153", "079212569X", "6305169187", "6301734734", "0792147618", "0792116887", "6304618344", "079213690X", "6303269834", "6304925131", "6305718792", "6304259131", "B00004WIDB", "6304935811", "6303057225", "6304143184", "6302250269"], "bought_together": ["B00000K3AN", "B00AEBBA36"], "also_viewed": ["B00000G3PA", "0792151712", "6300213668", "B00000JS61", "6303215734", "6303402348", "B00004WIDB", "079213690X", "6305750750", "B004751DFU", "B00005O893", "B00000K3AN", "6301792734", "B00E5I2MCM", "6305169187", "B00007LVCM", "B007SPPANM", "B00L4K3MLE", "B00FLML7HW", "B008QZ5PY2", "B00JBGWP3Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 234413}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.49, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXTF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HC1ZDJN6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "If you want to laugh and enjoy yourself, I recommend Bring It On. With a superb cast, catchy lines, and a fully developed plot, this movie is great! Kirsten Dunst stars as Torrance Shipman, the ditzy but loveable high school senior who is newly elected team captain of her high school cheerleading team. But when a replacement cheerleader, Missy Pantone, walks in to the Toros' cheerleading squad (hilariously portrayed by Eliza Dushku), she shows Torrance that the team's cheers are ripped off from the East Compton Clovers, and you can believe that the Clovers are fed up with the stealing. Torrance, horrified that her cheerleading career has been a fake, makes an effort to be original, but the result is a humiliating performance at a competition. Torrance is comforted by love interest Cliff Pantone (played by hottie Jesse Bradford), Missy's REALLY cute twin brother, and a romance begins. As the movie leads up to the UCA Nationals competition, the Clovers and Toros fight for the win. Who will it be? Well you better watch it for yourself. Bring It On is a refreshing change from the immature sick sex movies and it instead is fresh, bright, witty, and very funny.

The second disc holds four features, including a standard making-of featurette (15 minutes long) and a nifty segment that allows viewers to compare the storyboards to the final film and separate the music and sound effects in the train station sequence. More satisfying is the 20-minute short on the state of comic books, featuring revealing comments from critics and authors including Frank Miller (of the touchstoneDark Knightseries). Seven deleted scenes are introduced by the director, and while none is significant to the plot, they are all must-see for fans of the film.

{"description": "A prime example of the American film noir style that flourished during the 1940s and '50s,The Big Combois now highly regarded as a stylistic milestone for its innovative use of deep shadows and harsh, singular light sources to define its visual strategy. This look is largely credited to the rule-breaking brilliance of cinematographer John Alton, who turns a standard plot of the era into a richly atmospheric experiment in visual invention. Ignoring conventional approaches to lighting, Alton defines the screen in terms of blackness, often framing characters as silhouettes cast in ominous grays or thick, roiling fogs. Moving from clarity to abstraction with masterful grades in between, Alton's trend-setting style has been celebrated by cinematographers since the film's release in 1955.The film's plot keeps brisk pace with the visuals, focusing on the obsessive efforts of a tenacious detective (Cornel Wilde) to destroy a sadistic mobster (Richard Conte) whose vicious influence has nearly ruined the life of the woman (Jean Wallace) he keeps under his dark wing. Lee Van Cleef and Earl Holliman are nicely cast as the villain's toady henchmen, and Brian Donlevy's usual limitations serve him well as the humbled, frustrated kingpin who's been stifled by Conte's ambition. Director  Joseph&nbsp;H. Lewis previously demonstrated his raw, stylistic vigor with the  earlier cult favoriteGun Crazy, and here he's in peak form with a perfect match of subject and sensibility. The result is hard-boiled entertainment that still packs a punch.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00EL6A7XE", "B00E21D9ME", "B00023P4GA", "B009X919UE", "B0009X7678", "B00E6AVGKI", "B00C3ALM02", "B000KJTGFG", "B00D09AXUA", "B0007ZEO7S", "B0080JG2GE", "B00FPUN21O", "B001CC7PM6", "B004C2523M", "B000B8384Q", "B000B8380A", "B00BGARG3C", "B000EXDSBQ", "B00ICWO1LC", "B00I9BU60Q", "B00023P4II", "B0007ZEO8C", "B0024FAG80", "B00023P4FQ", "B00023P4G0", "B0024FAG8A", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B000B83846", "B00DO0MEOS", "B00005RDRL", "B000CNE088", "B00CN70WS8", "B00005AUK9", "B00004W19C", "B000RXVND8", "B0006UEVVS", "B000LN6UHI", "B000EXDSBG", "B00I9BU3M2", "B00007ELD1", "B0009X7682", "B00DBE97S8", "B00004XPPK", "B0006Z2NE0", "B000087F79", "B00004W229", "B00I9BU3L8", "B000CNE08I", "B00BM4Q46M", "B00KIZY3XW", "B0000CNY4Z", "B0010KHOSU", "B00BM4Q4PI", "B0089LT800", "B0089LT7ZG", "B00H8J2NTC", "B004H0M2UK", "B002YNQEFG", "B00CVB6XF2", "B00097DXY4", "B000244EWY", "B0024FAG6W", "B00DZP1BVO", "B00006II5J", "B0000EYUDY", "B000244EX8", "B000BGH2NG", "B00I116MVQ", "B00B27WRJM", "B00AB2NX4M", "B00B27WQ6G", "B001CC7PLW", "B00005AUKD", "B000FKO3VC", "B00AEBBA7W", "B00012L786", "B000FKO3VM", "B0080JG2L4", "B00004RER5", "B00FX6TYZS", "B00005Y70U", "B006X0ZN3K", "6305770328", "B00005Y70Q", "B00457ZNS8", "B00AB2NX1K", "B00DZP1C9K", "B0009X766O", "B00JX3SHIC", "B006WQUGI2", "B00KIZYDCI", "B008BSM1CI", "B000PKG7CU", "B008BSM1XC", "B0010KHOSA", "B0026ZQJT8", "B005152C9G", "B00DBE98OG", "B00D9BNONW", "B000CNE08S"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BGARG3C", "B00EL6A7XE", "B0087ZG7OI", "B00E21D9ME"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 349701}, "asin": "B00003XALW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/714FYEYPNDL._SY300_.gif", "title": "The Big Combo"}

{"description": "Toy StoryThere is greatness in film that can be discussed, dissected, and talked about late into the night. Then there is genius that is right in front of our faces--we smile at the spell it puts us into and are refreshed, and nary a word needs to be spoken. This kind of entertainment is what they used to call \"movie magic,\" and there is loads of it in this irresistible computer animation feature. Just a picture of these bright toys on the cover ofToy Storylooks intriguing, reawakening the kid in us. Filmmaker John Lasseter's shorts (namelyKnickknackandTin Toy, which can be found on the Pixar videoTiny Toy Stories) illustrate not only a technical brilliance but also a great sense of humor--one in which the pun is always intended. Lasseter thinks of himself as a storyteller first and an animator second, much like another film innovator, Walt Disney.Lasseter's story is universal and magical: what do toys do when they're not played with? Cowboy Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks), Andy's favorite bedroom toy, tries to calm the other toys (some original, some classic) during a wrenching time of year--the birthday party, when newer toys may replace them. Sure enough, Space Ranger Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) is the new toy that takes over the throne. Buzz has a crucial flaw, though--he believes he's the real Buzz Lightyear, not a toy. Bright and cheerful,Toy Storyis much more than a 90-minute commercial for the inevitable bonanza of Woody and Buzz toys. Lasseter further scores with perfect voice casting, including Don Rickles as Mr.&nbsp;Potato Head and Wallace Shawn as a meek dinosaur. The director-animator won a special Oscar for \"the development and inspired application of techniques that have made possible the first feature-length computer-animated film.\" In other words, the movie is great.--Doug ThomasToy Story 2John Lasseter and his gang of high-tech creators at Pixar create another entertainment for the ages. Like the few great movie sequels,Toy Story&nbsp;2comments on why the first one was so wonderful while finding a fresh angle worthy of a new film. The craze of toy collecting becomes the focus here, as we find out Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) is not only a beloved toy to Andy but also a rare doll from a popular '60s children's show. When a greedy collector takes Woody, Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) launches a rescue mission with Andy's other toys. To say more would be a crime because this is one of the most creative and smile-inducing films since, well, the firstToy Story.Although the toys look the same as in the 1994 feature, Pixar shows how much technology has advanced: the human characters look more human, backgrounds are superior, and two action sequences that book-end the film are dazzling. And it's a hoot for kids and adults. The film is packed with spoofs, easily accessible in-jokes, and inspired voice casting (with newcomer Joan Cusack especially a delight as Cowgirl Jessie). But as the Pixar canon of films illustrates, the filmmakers are storytellers first. Woody's heart-tugging predicament can easily be translated into the eternal debate of living a good life versus living  forever.Toy Story&nbsp;2also achieved something in the U.S. two other outstanding 1999 animated features (The Iron Giant,Princess Mononoke) could not: it became a huge box-office hit.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00275EHJG", "B00AFEX83C", "B004RKXW0E", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B00005JNS0", "B00007LVCM", "B000VBJEEG", "B0013FSL3E", "B001KVZ6FW", "B0046A9RMM", "B00005JN4W", "B00CQRN3QI", "B00003CXB4", "B0000E32WJ", "B0001I561E", "B000YERP2S", "B0002YLCOM", "B000B8QG4A", "B001HN6922", "B000AY74OG", "B0039N74CW", "B00E9ZATJO", "B001O5LVPI", "B00024I2Z4", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B000035Z48", "B00003CXCQ", "B000AAF1TU", "B003ZHVJGO", "B0084IHVGG", "B004BAXBVK", "B0000524D0", "B0034GK74G", "B00JK531ES", "B00004R99S", "B0000764FF", "B0001I55W4", "B00G7TIKMI", "B00CUDD0C0", "B001NCDFTW", "B00003CX8Y", "B000059TCD", "B000DWMYQ8", "B003H9M1Q2", "B001ILFUDC", "B000AAF1U4", "B00335EQ0E", "B008JFUQ16", "B00005TN8K", "B0033BM3K8", "B00005JLR2", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00005JMQZ", "B001OMU6UM", "B000UVKGPI", "B000EDQGLK", "B00EV1YZ96", "B00008G8LM", "B003UNWV60", "B00005RDSQ", "B00005T7H3", "B0000694ZS", "B0081VMY3G", "B0030IIYYS", "B00007AJGH", "B0013ND30M", "B008YWY0HK", "B00G5G7EXY", "B004LWZW7Y", "B0042U94UQ", "B0030IIZ4M", "B00G7SRSHW", "B000MV9026", "B0007KTBIU", "B00004R99F", "B00003CX5P", "B00004R99O", "B000GUJZ00", "B0000AOX0O", "B004HO6I4M", "B001ECQ75A", "B00005Y71G", "B006OUNKGG", "B004HO6HXY", "B000063V8M", "B00F522C7C", "B0006JMLRK", "B00004R99U", "B005LAIHW2", "B001ILFUD2", "B000050MN3", "B001HN6918", "B002JUFPUY"], "bought_together": ["B00275EHJG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0030IIZ4M", "B0030IIYYS", "B008OMJWCI", "B00275EHJG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 16823}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 69.77, "brand": "Walt Disney Records", "asin": "B00004U9WQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518G5RSWQBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Toy Story &amp; Toy Story 2 (2 Pack)"}

Generous photo galleries are included, featuring shots of the primary cast, sets, and costumes (the last matched by a gallery of conceptual drawings), and the feature-length commentary by director Roland Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin is worthwhile, if not altogether essential.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFXKUI", "B00AMSLDTM", "B00AEBBA36", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00001ZWUS", "0800177967", "B000A2WP7O", "B00008G8M4", "B00003CXTG", "B004AOECXI", "B002O3Z510", "B000065U1N", "B00005221M", "B00000G3PA", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000E5N6LG", "B002O3Z50Q", "B0001HLVS2", "079284646X", "B00003CXA6", "B008MIMWOY", "6304711905", "0783225733", "B002VWNID6", "B0002WZTOI", "B000P0J0EW", "B00009OOFA", "B000NOKFHQ", "0783231202", "B000P0J0EM", "B003U0AHBO", "B004SIP7TE", "B00003CXQA", "B0000TANUI", "0792839137", "B00011CZRE", "B00005B6JZ", "B0002DRDBY", "B00AEFXRRO", "B002AS464Q", "B000WGWQG8", "B00026L9CU", "B00005JN5E", "B00007GZYC", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005ATZT", "B000067D1R", "B000U1ZV8K", "B00B0U2SFE", "B003AWRMCE", "6304806434", "B00AEBB932", "B00005JM6F", "B00005JL3T", "B002ZG997C", "B00AEFXVCU", "B000FI8MPW", "B000VKL6ZM", "B00319ECI8", "B005LAIGYQ", "B0045HCJT4", "B0008JIJ2O", "B002O3Z50G", "B00AZNEW5G", "B00008AOTO", "B000LP6KNU", "0783227973", "B002VWNIBI", "B004FQX5B6", "B00AEBB9WI", "B004IK30M8", "B004IK30MI", "B0007PALM0", "B00AEBBA0E", "B001TK80D4", "B000O77SRC", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000095WW8", "079283366X", "6305558167", "B00AEFXKOO", "B0007TKNM4", "B0002YLCG0", "B00003CXHJ", "B000MZHW40", "B000F48D4G", "B001BNFRB2", "B00AEFXYJA", "B000QXDED6", "0767817710", "B0004Z33EG", "B00005JN0W", "B003ASLJRC", "B00HEPE6MM", "0790729695", "B000FVQLRA", "B00004WG2F", "B008MIMWQW", "B000GG4Y32", "B0068FZ0O2"], "bought_together": ["B00001ZWUS", "B00AEBBA36"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFY5B6", "B004AOECXI", "B000NOKFHQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2823}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00004XPPG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NDFXHAW9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Patriot (Special Edition)"}

{"description": "Part conspiracy theory and part religious message,Left Behind(based on the first in a series of runaway bestsellers by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins) is a passable, occasionally compelling thriller that turns the rapture and the ascendance of the Antichrist into something resembling a Robert Ludlum espionage potboiler. The beginning, though, is pure Stephen King: as morose pilot Rayford Steele (Brad Johnson) steers his jet plane toward London, comely flight attendant Hattie Daniels (Chelsea Noble) informs him that a number of passengers have disappeared--at 37,000 feet, leaving their neatly pressed clothes behind. And they're not the only ones who've gone missing. The mass disappearances throw the world into chaos, and the sinisterly compelling Nicolae Carpathia (Gordon Currie), head of the U.N., selflessly steps in to help broker peace among the world's nations. But is he as good intentioned as he seems?Turns out the appropriately named Mr. Carpathia is behind a plot to rule the world and control its food supply, and intrepid reporter Buck Williams (Kirk Cameron, better than you'd expect) is onto him--with a little help from some biblical prophecies. Suffering the problem that befalls most first installments in a series of books and movies,Left Behindbusies itself with the task of introducing characters and setting up expository plot lines, and audiences may be frustrated by the lack of action--Rayford's somewhat labored crisis of faith takes up a good chunk of the film. Still, it's an intriguing premise that should satisfy fans of the novel and possibly pick up a few more converts along the way (be warned, though, this is a modestly budgeted film that looks more like a cable TV movie than the latest James Bond extravaganza). And, if like a fair number of the film's characters, you can't figure out that someone named \"Nicolae Carpathia\" is a bad guy, then, well, you need to bone up on your evil villains.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006HMPB", "B000AY6S0C", "8901732319"], "bought_together": ["B00006HMPB", "B000AY6S0C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 375419}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.73, "brand": "Namesake", "asin": "B00004YS7F", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517490R83YL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Left Behind - The Movie [VHS]"}

{"description": "AlthoughSunshinewas made by a Hungarian, Istv&aacute;n Szab&oacute;, and deals with the history of Hungary as refracted through three generations of a Jewish-Hungarian family, you might be more inclined to give it three hours of your own life if you approach it as a David Lean movie in spirit. Itisan English-language picture, and Maurice Jarre's music recalls his score forDoctor Zhivago. Szab&oacute; emulates Lean's intimate-epic style of merging the sweep of history with the crystalline detailing of individual lives, so that the shape of destiny is glimpsed through personal moments that feel at once evanescent and eternal. His lighting cameraman, Lajos Koltai, is one of the handful of cinematographers equal to capturing these moments in lapidary images--cinematic sunshine of the highest order.\"Sunshine\" is a literal translation of Sonnenschein, the family name of the central characters. And \"destiny\" is one meaning of Sors, the name three Sonnenschein offspring choose for themselves to better assimilate as subjects of the Austro-Hungarian empire. Two are brothers, Ignatz (Ralph Fiennes) and Gustave (James Frain); their sister (by adoption) Valerie (Jennifer Ehle) is really their cousin. Both men love her, and Ignatz rocks the ultratraditional family by taking her as his wife. Nevertheless, the Sonnenscheins and the Sors enter upon the 20th century in loving solidarity, grateful to live under a liberal and tolerant regime. That's all swept away by the Great War, the rise of Nazism, and its replacement, the new fascism of Stalinist Communism. Valerie survives them all--though she's played later on by Rosemary Harris, Ehle's own mother. For his part--or parts--Ralph Fiennes goes on to embody two later generations of Sonnenschein/Sors men, the proudly patriotic Adam and his son, the rudderless Ivan, whose guilt over being a compliant prisoner at Auschwitz leads him to buy into the passionate puritanism of the Stalinist purges. Fiennes rises to the awesome challenge of creating three utterly distinct characters who all share the same congenital weaknesses and aching potential for greatness.This is a film of considerable beauty and sometimes shattering power.

Conor O'Neill (Reeves) is a charming ne'er-do-well with a disturbing gambling addiction. His penchant for betting on the wrong teams leaves him owing several thousand dollars to very violent people, and he ends up coaching a children's baseball team to pay off his debt. The movie skimps a bit on process: the kids start out as terrible players and become better but we don't see how; Conor starts caring but we don't see why. As by-the-numbers movies go, though, it isn't a bad one. The young actors in the cast are talented and understated. Most of the kids' characters are only barely fleshed out by the script, but this keeps the movie from being hijacked by extra-cute mugging. Parents should be cautioned--this movie has some very violent scenes that will frighten young children, and swearing is depicted as precocious and adorable.

{"description": "WithThe Return of the King, the greatest fantasy epic in film history draws to a grand and glorious conclusion. Director Peter Jackson's awe-inspiring adaptation of the Tolkien classicThe Lord of the Ringscould never fully satisfy those who remain exclusively loyal to Tolkien's expansive literature, but as a showcase for physical and technical craftsmanship it is unsurpassed in pure scale and ambition, setting milestone after cinematic milestone as the brave yet charmingly innocent Hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood) continues his mission to Mordor, where he is destined to destroy the soul-corrupting One Ring of Power in the molten lava of Mount Doom. While the heir to the kingdom of Men, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), endures the massive battle at Minas Tirith with the allegiance of the elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom), dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and the great wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), Frodo and stalwart companion Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) must survive the schizoid deceptions of Gollum, who remains utterly convincing as a hybrid of performance (by Andy Serkis) and subtly nuanced computer animation.Jackson and cowriters Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens have much ground to cover; that they do so with intense pacing and epic sweep is impressive enough, but by investing greater depth and consequence in the actions of fellow Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), they ensure thatReturn of the Kingmaintains the trilogy's emphasis on intimate fellowship. While several major characters appear only briefly, and one (Christopher Lee's evil wizard, Saruman) relegated entirely to the extended version on DVD, Jackson is to be commended for his editorial acumen; like Legolas the archer, his aim as a filmmaker is consistently true, and he remains faithful to Tolkien's overall vision. IfReturnsuffers from too many endings, as some critic suggested, it's only because the epic's conclusion is so loyally inclusive of the actors--most notably Astin--who gave it such strength to begin with. By ending theLOTRtrilogy with noble integrity and faith in the power of imaginative storytelling,The Return of the King, like its predecessors, will stand as an adventure for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B002ZG980U", "B002PMV9FG", "B008UZA8FY", "B001NGML48", "B00005JM5E", "B001GZ6QC4", "B005COPWZW", "B008M4C1EO", "B00HFFE8HE", "039548930X", "B000W7F5SS", "B000I0RQVI", "B002VWNIDG", "B000E6EK2Y", "B001BYMX4A", "B004M1A21K", "B007K3JFUQ", "B001DHXT20", "B001UV4XHY", "0345325818", "B003Y5H54W", "B00005JNJV", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000A3XY5A", "B004LWZWGA", "B000U7WV1Y", "B005LXQLRW", "B001OQCV6A", "B000E8M0VA", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000EHRVMY", "0618640150", "B003ZK99NQ", "B0013FDM7E", "B00005JPH2", "B000UNYK4E", "B009JBWOU0", "B00003CX5P", "B00008G8M5", "B00GKOJ98E", "B004LWZW42", "B000H30B2C", "B000P0J0C4", "B00CZDLGDU", "B000M341QE", "B00008G8M4", "B000FKO5QK", "B00HWWUQYY", "B007SPPANM", "B008JFUO72", "B001DJLD1M", "0345538374", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00005JKCH", "B004SIP9U6", "B000YGGNMO", "B00E5I2M9K", "0618126988", "B005OCFGTO", "B00E8S2JZ4", "6305313687", "B004AKCME8", "B0002KVUKM", "B000AARKOO", "B0006GAO5Y", "B000K7VHQ4", "B002ZG997C", "B00AHTYI5M", "B008JFUS0U", "B0042MEQVG", "B00275EGWY", "B00E9PMML2", "B008UZDXEW", "B004SIP7F8", "B00116GEJS", "B00003CXI1", "B003ZKBELG", "B003Y5H5EW", "B000V4UFZK", "B0007PLLBU", "B001DTPZNY", "B002O3Z50Q", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000LP6KNU", "B005G4TJUC", "B00AW0KHTM", "B002ZG97YM", "054792819X", "B00AEFXZJE", "B0000YEEGM", "B002IPFWTE", "B001ECQ75A", "B000065U1N", "B0051MKNV8", "B000W796OM", "B00J49R1BY"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HFFE8HE", "B00003CWT6", "B00005JKZV", "B00BEZTMFY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1589}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JKZY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HS7iSFv5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)"}
{"description": "For anyone who's wallowed in the inanities of 1970s disaster movies,The Big Busis not only witty but downright endearing. Instead of an endangered airliner or a capsized cruise ship, this dippily deadpan parody features a block-long, atomic-powered, luxury super-Greyhound setting off on its first transcontinental run with a garish cross section of humankind programmed for redemption, retribution, or just sublime ridiculousness as they roll toward Doom--or Denver, whichever comes first. Writers Fred Freeman and Lawrence J. Cohen, who penned the daffy historical spoofStart the Revolution Without Me(1970), twist the sententious ironies of disaster-movie dialogue into pretzels (priceless scene: Richard B. Shull, as a \"terminal traveler\" with six months to live, and Bob Dishy, a discredited veterinarian who fitted a rabbit for an IUD, debating who knows more about bitterness). James Frawley's direction is drolly clich&#xE9;-savvy, but his touch proved too delicate for 1976 audiences; it remained forAirplane!to grab the disaster-spoof brass ring four years later. Still, it's not too late to climb aboard.--Richard T.

{"description": "A Beautiful Mindmanages to twist enough pathos out of John Nash's incredible life story to redeem an at-times goofy portrayal of schizophrenia. Russell Crowe tackles the role with characteristic fervor, playing the Nobel prize-winning mathematician from his days at Princeton, where he developed a groundbreaking economic theory, to his meteoric rise to the cover ofForbesmagazine and an MIT professorship, and on through to his eventual dismissal due to schizophrenic delusions. Of course, it is the delusions that fascinate director Ron Howard and, predictably, go astray. Nash's other world, populated as it is by a maniacal Department of Defense agent (Ed Harris), an imagined college roommate who seems straight out ofDead Poets Society, and an orphaned girl, is so fluid and scriptlike as to make the viewer wonder if schizophrenia is really as slick as depicted. Crowe's physical intensity drags us along as he works admirably to carry the film on his considerable shoulders. No doubt the story of Nash's amazing will to recover his life without the aid of medication is a worthy one, his eventual triumph heartening. Unfortunately, Howard's flashy style is unable to convey much of it.--Fionn Meade", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SIP7ZS", "B0043X1FL8", "B004FQX5B6", "B00AEFZ63M", "B0000YEEGM", "B00003CWQR", "B000ARTN3I", "B000EHQU0S", "6305144168", "0767811100", "B000066HAS", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEFYSWM", "B0002B15ZG", "1451628420", "B00000IQV7", "B000021Y7L", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFY5B6", "B003ASLJQI", "B000XJD3JI", "B004SUDQ22", "B004U7MR1Y", "B00A81MV3U", "B0043X1FM2", "B00B0U2SFE", "B002NZK5UK", "B000N6U0E2", "B003B3NGS6", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00004RJ73", "B00003CWRX", "B00125WAWS", "B00005JLSB", "6305428352", "B00008EY60", "0800141806", "B00001ZWUS", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEBB9CS", "6304712936", "0780619587", "B00007GZR5", "B000YAF4MA", "B000KX0IOA", "B004SIP8W0", "B00080ZG10", "B00B9LNPA6", "0783225733", "B003U0AHBO", "B00004BZIY", "B00005JND5", "B000E33VWW", "B003NF97NK", "B0038M2AZA", "B002CPMB9O", "B000P0J0EM", "B000A3XY5A", "B00AFEXRME", "B00005Q4CS", "B000LC55F2", "B00AEBB9SM", "B0006FYOTC", "B000056VP4", "B002WNU0QW", "B000RTB0R6", "0684819066", "B00003CXZ4", "B00AEFY17E", "B000EGDB10", "B002VECM6S", "B002ZG980U", "B001P9KR8U", "B001N44BVQ", "B000LP6KNU", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0002V7ON8", "B0018CWW5K", "B00JPQ1INI", "B0030Y12FU", "B003ELKNH2", "B000K2UGZM", "B00121QGPY", "B0001CNRAM", "B00003CXFV", "0783223609", "B007N31YH0", "B002HK9IDQ", "B005BYBZEK", "B000JJ5F8O", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B003UESJHO", "B00A7MSQSO", "B004SIP9U6", "B00005JL78", "B00012QLB4", "B003UESJH4", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000K7VHQE"], "bought_together": ["B004SIP7ZS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00C7MW5EI", "B004SIP7ZS", "B001F34HRS", "B00001ZWUS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3605}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.99, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

As shown by this outstanding motion picture, their universally touching plight and unparalleled courage are a beautiful testament to the undying strength of the human spirit!", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005I0DV4Y", "0702233552", "B0007UDC80", "6305428417", "B000A7Q2KA", "B00393SG42", "B001PPGAIA", "B0001I55Y2", "B00L5Y8GJC", "B00019330O", "B001CDR1F6", "B003Y7F1OG", "B000S8CLSS", "B005EVJCOA", "B0001FVDI2", "B00BTYJYR6", "B005J7K9BO", "B00A33J8YS", "B000FDFSXQ", "B000A2WA9C", "B0025Z4Q3U", "B000YGE18C", "B003DF459G", "B000065V3Z", "B00196NHAO", "B008LFYZAM", "B00D9EJFS2", "B001PSUM9K", "B0000D0YWJ", "B000UL61KW", "B0006FFRB6", "B005GRF3DG", "B0008GGN9I", "B00315I6DE", "B0013XS87U", "B00337DRGQ", "B00CBVWXCO", "B000KX0IOA", "B00AL6P4A4", "B004X4O988", "0780021134", "B001JXPC28", "B001N5BDX4", "B0008FXSSS", "0345368002", "0375724494", "0702232815", "B004UOHNIY", "B004SIP8WU", "B00005MKKS", "B000LC4C24", "B0000647KC", "B00AZMFG48", "B009B6XJVQ", "B00005QAPI", "B00003CXB5", "B004326F50", "B000056KMW", "B00CS7GYF8", "6305428360", "B000YAA68W", "B001UW59JO", "B00116VG3M", "B00393SG3S", "B004089D7O", "B004C45AZU", "B0091GE7K8", "B0007WFUGK", "B00D2UMHQ0", "0949206318", "B00005N6RH", "B00004TJKJ", "B001LPWGCI", "B000FUF7BM", "B000V2IOXC", "B00G15MDI0", "B004SIP8W0", "B0015OKWKI", "B0000C2IWO", "B002RBHDFU"], "bought_together": ["B005I0DV4Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0702233552", "B005I0DV4Y", "B00393SG42", "B0007UDC80"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10725}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.99, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JLD4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QNTJAV8RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rabbit-Proof Fence"}
{"description": "From one of the most celebrated filmmakers in the history of animated cinema comes the most acclaimed film of 2002. Hayao Miyazaki's latest triumph, filled with astonishing animation and epic adventure, is a dazzling masterpiece for the ages. It's a \"wonderfully welcoming work of art that's as funny and entertaining as it is brilliant, beautiful, and deep\" (Joe Morgenstern, Wall Street Journal). SPIRITED AWAY is a wondrous fantasy about a young girl, Chihiro, trapped in a strange new world of spirits. When her parents undergo a mysterious transformation, she must call upon the courage she never knew she had to free herself and return her family to the outside world. An unforgettable story brimming with creativity, SPIRITED AWAY will take you on a journey beyond your imagination. \"To enter the world of Hayao Miyazaki is to experience a kind of lighthearted enchantment that is unique to the world of animation\" (Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times).

{"description": "Outstanding picture and sound plus tons of features makeCharlie's Angels: Full Throttlea fully loaded DVD.  Don't expect more T&A; in the unrated edition, however.  The only difference is glimpses of more intense violence in a few of the fight scenes.  For example, in the theatrical version you'll see an angel flying through the air, but in the unrated version you'll then see her lying expressionless on the ground.  Also, blood flies out of Drew Barrymore's mouth in one scene.  On his commentary track, director McG discusses inside jokes, visual effects, and shots that didn't quite work for him.  Like a TV sportscaster, he uses a telestrator, but only to occasionally circle items of interest or draw arrows.  There's also an amusing commentary track by the three writers, who chuckle over inside jokes and discuss how the film was changed from the original script.  They preface their comments with: \"I guess they asked us to do this just to prove that writers worked on this movie.\"  \"Who are we kidding?  Who's listening to this right now?\"If you want still more info, there's a trivia track with pop-up factoids with occasional links to more featurettes, a jukebox that offers clips of 11 songs and explanations of why they were picked, a cameo-graphy that offers clips of 13 personalities and why we should know them, and eight 4- to 18-minute featurettes exploring such topics as stunts, vehicles, costumes, and the Pussycat Dolls dance troupe.

The story finds Earth's post-World War III humankind in a state of severe emotional repression: If no one feels anything, no one will be inspired by dark passions to attack their neighbors. Writer-director Kurt Wimmer's monochromatic,Metropolis-influenced cityscape provides an excellent backdrop to the heavy-handed mission of John Preston (Christian Bale), a top cop who busts \"sense offenders\" and crushes sentimental, sensual, and artistic relics from a bygone era. Predictably, Preston becomes intrigued by his victims and that which they die to cherish; he stops taking his mandatory, mood-flattening drug and is even aroused by a doomed prisoner (Emily Watson).

In addition to the various goofy outtakes (in which  Cate Blanchett curses adorably as her rifle misfires), the DVD includes  three different versions of the movie's ending, which offer an educational  glimpse into the decision-making process that shapes a movie's emotional  impact.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000F8O2QU", "B00009RDG9", "B001NFNFIK", "B0011V7PSC", "B0000TANUI", "B00005JH9M", "B000189LE2", "B00A92MF6Q", "0767817672", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000F48D3M", "B001LRJH0U", "B000GFRI4K", "B000NIVJFY", "B004SIP6QI", "0792835727", "B000NOIVT0", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00J5G1P2W", "B000059H7K", "6305504024", "B000E6ESU8", "B000EHSVUU", "B007FQXEXW", "B0006HBZXS", "B005FQ2HDC", "0767812182", "6304711905", "B00HOGBXS6", "B003AWRMCE", "B0008ENHUS", "B00116GEJS", "B00000K3D5", "B00005JKN2", "B00AEFYPHA", "B004AOECXI", "B00F3TDA6O", "B004XWGZK0", "B00IJS2OHM", "B000EHSVW8", "B000031EGW", "B0007OY2OO", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B009INAI02", "B002NZK5R8", "B003NF97MQ", "B00096S4DK", "B00083FZFY", "B00JU949TK", "B0018PH3L0", "B0007MAO0C", "B00AEFY4IA", "B00JA3RVG4", "B004SEUJOQ", "B0038EGD3I", "B00KHA99BY", "B00005UQ9T", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B000XR9L50", "B00028G7IO", "B0001Z3I0I", "0767817710", "B000BITVBA", "B000ANVPP6", "B000W1SZBS", "B00005JKTF", "B002O3Z4WK", "B00003CXGV", "6304698747", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00AEFXFW6", "B0000694Y3", "B00AEFYSEA", "B003L20IG0", "B00GMV8JVI", "6305310335", "B0000C2IR4", "B000NQRR34", "B005NGKMOU", "B00A92MD8G", "B00AEBB8W4", "B000059XTH", "B0007TKHGG", "B00007AJE1", "B0045HCJTO", "B000BRP4BM", "B0016OLXN2", "0790736411", "B00IKM5MIA", "B0045HCJ8K", "B00096S49Y", "B000QRI1GW", "B00368PSKK", "B007PXYWNQ", "B000A2UBN4", "B00005LOL0", "B00004WG2F", "B00H9L26AA", "B00AEFXKUI", "B00AEBB9UK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001AZW73M", "B000F8O2QU", "B001NFNFIK", "B00009RDG9"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 141357}, "asin": "B00005JMPT", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K1WVQMH7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Missing (Widescreen Special Edition)"}

{"description": "Jamie Foxx's uncannily accurate performance isn't the only good thing aboutRay. Riding high on a wave of Oscar buzz, Foxx proved himself worthy of all the hype by portraying blind R&B; legend Ray Charles in a warts-and-all performance that Charles approved shortly before his death in June 2004. Despite a few dramatic embellishments of actual incidents (such as the suggestion that the accidental drowning of Charles's younger brother caused all the inner demons that Charles would battle into adulthood), the film does a remarkable job of summarizing Charles's strengths as a musical innovator and his weaknesses as a philandering heroin addict who recorded some of his best songs while flying high as a kite. Foxx seems to be channeling Charles himself, and as he did with the life of Ritchie Valens in La Bamba, director Taylor Hackford gets most of the period details absolutely right as he chronicles Ray's rise from \"chitlin circuit\" performer in the early '50s to his much-deserved elevation to legendary status as one of the all-time great musicians. Foxx expertly lip-syncs to Ray Charles' classic recordings, but you could swear he's the real deal in a film that honors Ray Charles without sanitizing his once-messy life.--Jeff ShannonMore on Ray CharlesModern Sounds in Country and Western Music(CD)The Genius of Ray Charles(CD)Ray Charles and Betty Carter--Dedicated to You(CD)Genius & Soul--The 50th Anniversary Collection(CD)Ray: A Tribute to the Movie, the Music, and the Man(book)More Albums by Ray Charles", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000E8QVWY", "B001P3SA94", "B00465I1CE", "B00005JKMQ", "6305428409", "B003BV8I3Q", "B00AEFXTKO", "B0002LE9HC", "B000BOH8X2", "B00AEFYG3S", "0790739313", "B000JJSL1W", "B000A50460", "B00005TQ44", "0783230524", "B0009R1TJ0", "0780627822", "B00AEFZ63M", "B000P0J092", "B002VWNICM", "B00EV4EUT8", "B000JLTRH2", "B000N6U0E2", "B0041QSZS8", "0783237367", "078324228X", "B00AEFY6TW", "B003HKN534", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00007AJG1", "B00007L4KF", "B00ANDDBBY", "B000BITV9W", "0783114907", "B00007AJG2", "1558908390", "B00005JLRZ", "B000FVQLQQ", "6305692572", "0767821637", "B002CA68NO", "B00AFEXRME", "B002CPMB9O", "B004SIP93S", "B000063JDI", "B00005NB8K", "B00125WAWS", "6305505780", "B000IFRT4W", "B001TUZGPO", "B009NNM9OA", "B000RB6XG2", "B000P0J0CY", "B0001FR3IQ", "B000FVQLRA", "B00066FAVW", "B002XMGGK6", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00DW5IL2E", "B00005JPK8", "0767811070", "B000I0QL7I", "B000069I0E", "B00080ZG10", "0306814315", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00049QQHI", "B00000JGHV", "B0007CEXYK", "B0001Q4BOE", "B0000YEE6M", "B000NIVJF4", "B008Y1YJN6", "B00066VTU8", "B001132GNY", "B0006QAIG4", "B0034G4OSG", "B000C20VRS", "0800141741", "B00A2H9QN8", "B000Y11B8K", "B00005LB86", "B000056VP4", "B00005JL72", "B000095J01", "B000Q7ZNZ4", "B002CAWNEM", "B003UESJHO", "B00066FAQW", "0783230389", "B0013FDM7E", "B00007ELEO", "B00AMEZDJW", "B000P0J0CE", "B003Y5H4ZC", "0767821955", "B00003GPFT", "B0021L8V2A"], "bought_together": ["B000E8QVWY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002LE9HC", "B000E8QVWY", "B000BOH8X2", "B00AZMFJYA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17277}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.89, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JND5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41RQ8ETK19L._SX300_.jpg", "title": "Ray (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Despite super effects, a huge budget, and the cinematic pedigree of alien-happy Steven Spielberg, this take on H.G. Wells's novel is basically a horror film packaged as a sci-fi thrill ride. Instead of a mad slasher, however, Spielberg (along with writers Josh Friedman & David Koepp) utilizes aliens hell-bent on quickly destroying humanity, and the terrifying results that prey upon adult fears, especially in the post-9/11 world. The realistic results could be a new genre, the grim popcorn thriller; often you feel like you're watching Schindler's List more than Spielberg's other thrill-machine movies (Jaws,Jurassic Park). The film centers on Ray Ferrier, a divorced father (Tom Cruise, oh so comfortable) who witnesses one giant craft destroy his New Jersey town and soon is on the road with his teen son (Justin Chatwin) and preteen daughter (Dakota Fanning) in tow, trying to keep ahead of the invasion. The film is, of course, impeccably designed and produced by Spielberg's usual crew of A-class talent. The aliens are genuinely scary, even when the film--like the novel--spends a good chunk of time in a basement. Readers of the book (or viewers of the deft 1953 adaptation) will note the variation of whom and how the aliens come to Earth, which poses some logistical problems. The film opens and closes with narration from the novel read by Morgan Freeman, but Spielberg could have adapted Orson Welles's words from the famous Halloween Eve 1938 radio broadcast: \"We couldn't soap all your windows and steal all your garden gates by tomorrow night, so we did the best next thing: we annihilated the world.\"--Doug ThomasWar of the Worldsat Amazon.comThe SoundtrackThe War of the Worlds(1953)War of the Worlds - The Complete First Season(TV series)Classic Sci-Fi Movies and Their RemakesAliens Invade on DVDThe Prog-rock Opera (no kidding)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B00005JL78", "B001SGEUYW", "B00008G8M4", "B00005JL3T", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AEFXNLY", "B00005JMXX", "B001OQCV2E", "B000VECAD0", "B002O3Z510", "B0002V7OI8", "B000H30B2C", "B000EGDB10", "B00005JN2Z", "B005LAIIMG", "B005PTYP70", "B002O3Z50G", "B0002V7ON8", "B00005JN0T", "B00K2CHW48", "B002SJIO4A", "0783225547", "B008JFUO36", "B00005JKLZ", "B00AS1Q93S", "1936594056", "B004EPYZUS", "B001TUZG4K", "B00AEFXR1K", "B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFXYJA", "0767817478", "B0034G4ORC", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00070FX5U", "B0045HCJSA", "B00000G3PA", "B005LAIHPE", "B003Y5H5GK", "B00AEBBA72", "B00003CWU3", "B00I9TDMRM", "B001ECDVKE", "B00003CXXP", "B000V4UFZK", "B0010X73ZG", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00005JKFR", "B000XT1P4S", "B003HKN52U", "B0009PW4D2", "B000HRMAPE", "B004EPYZPS", "B0018QPPXW", "B0002WZTOI", "B00AEBB9LO", "B004LWZW4M", "B003ABZHAO", "B003YJFALS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B000OT6V64", "B004P7CN7W", "B000CCBC9O", "B00000ILDD", "0767803434", "B001L57ZYM", "B000065V3G", "B007STBUHI", "B002ZG980U", "B008JFUQZ2", "B00005B6JZ", "B0006GANOQ", "B000F1IQN2", "1494343576", "B001GCUO02", "B00004Y87O", "0783226810", "B004EPYZSK", "B000P0J0BU", "B005LAIHXQ", "B001680M26", "B000EQHXN2", "B0045HCJFS", "B00004BZIY", "B00008G8M5", "B00003CXQA", "B008JFUS0U", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00EIN6KJ0", "B0000DZ6N3", "B000MV8A9A", "B00005JKYX", "B0000YEEGM", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B0013FCWUW", "B002ZG9864", "B00003CWTI", "B008MIMWQW", "B00IKM5OCO"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBB8VK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B004LWZW4M", "B00005JL78", "B004EPYZSK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18739}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JNTI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51upxzPRnXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "War of the Worlds"}

There's also 13 minutes of interviews with the film's producers, and a 24-minute roundtable in which James Lipton interviews Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank, and Morgan Freeman.  All displaying their Oscar statuettes, they discuss Eastwood's directorial style, the craft of acting, and Freeman's dance background.

{"description": "COACH CARTER tells the inspiring true story of controversial high school basketball coach Ken Carter (Jackson).  Making headlines for his emphasis on the importance of academics over athletics, Carter requests all the members of the team to sign contracts, promising to maintain a certain grade point average.  When the players fail to live up to this agreement, Carter benches the entire team, locking the gym and forfeiting games to prove his point.  This infuriates the community who sees this as a hindrance to the future professional athletic careers of the players.  Through hard work and dedication, Carter eventually gets his point across to his team and the community, going above and beyond to ensure a solid academic future for his team.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EXZFCQ", "B000056VP4", "B001FB55NK", "B00005JPBO", "0792843592", "B00125WAWS", "B000J3OTT6", "B002YMWQ2M", "B002VECM6S", "B00AEFY17E", "B002VWNICM", "630514415X", "B000K2UGZM", "B0001US66Y", "B000KHYN9C", "B00004Y2R1", "B000Q7ZNZ4", "B00004W221", "B00AEFXJY0", "B003EJO8KC", "B000N6U0E2", "B0000AC8LH", "B00005JNEW", "B001LGXIA6", "B002NZK5UK", "B000068NNU", "B000LRZHR8", "B00005JLG1", "B00008EY60", "B00006SFL7", "6305428271", "B000J3OTSM", "B009NNM9OA", "0060772522", "B00B83N2NU", "B000FS9ULC", "B004GJYROG", "B00AEBB9UU", "B006GVN05O", "B00AEFYE08", "B000X5RBXG", "B000BFH2C8", "B008WCP2OC", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B003NF97NK", "B002JCSWV6", "B002NZK5QO", "B000067D1S", "B000XSWVEC", "B000R7G6H2", "B004RP9ITS", "B000BITV9W", "B00005JKWX", "B000KB489I", "B002E01LL6", "B000G1R394", "B000A0GP0Y", "B004KPLVX6", "B0050MB4OO", "B003ASLJQI", "B000BTITFI", "B00005JLRZ", "B0007WFYBG", "B00006LPH6", "6305428352", "B00AEFYJI0", "B00021R7E4", "B00005JKE4", "B002D755AI", "B0001FR3HW", "B00ANDDBBY", "B00003CY51", "B000LXGXX4", "B007C4ZJ0S", "B009AJB0YM", "B00005ASOC", "B001F0TM62", "B00E1HIXA2", "B006ZYCGXO", "B000BNTMFK", "B002CA68NO", "B00005JPK8", "B0006FYOTC", "B0012QHUB8", "B0007WFY02", "B0016MOV92", "6305505780", "078324228X", "B0013FSL1Q", "B001DJLD12", "B00000JGHV", "B00007AJG1", "B00AEFXGWK", "B000FUTVLY", "B000MNOX94", "B00553K9IA", "B009POCG2C", "B000274T94", "B00006JDVT", "B00JPQ1INI"], "bought_together": ["B000056VP4", "B000EXZFCQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EXZFCQ", "B000056VP4", "B000J3OTT6", "B00005JPBO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 104069}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.59, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B00005JNNZ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NSYXNEMSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Coach Carter (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Literary adaptations just don't get any better than director Joe Wright's 2005 version of Jane Austen'sPride & Prejudice. The key word here isadaptation, because Wright and gifted screenwriter Deborah Moggach have taken liberties with Austen's classic novel that purists may find objectionable, but in this exquisite film their artistic decisions are entirely justified and exceptionally well executed. It's a more rural England that we see here, circa 1790 (as opposed to Austen's early 19th century), in which Elizabeth Bennet (Keira Knightley) is one of several sisters primed for marriage, with an anxious mother (Brenda Blethyn) only too desperate to see her daughters paired off with the finest, richest husbands available. Elizabeth is strong-willed and opinionated, but her head (not to mention her pride and prejudice) lead her heart astray when she meets the wealthy Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen), whose own sense of decency and discretion (not to mentionhispride and prejudice) prevent him from expressing his mutual affection. They're clearly meant for each other, and as Knightley's performance lights up the screen (still young enough to be girlishly impertinent, yet wise beyond her 20 years), Austen's timeless romance yields yet another timeless adaptation, easily on par with the belovedBBC miniseriesthat has been embraced by millions since originally broadcast in 1995. Individual tastes will vary as to which version should be considered \"definitive,\" but with a stellar supporting cast including Judi Dench and Donald Sutherland, this impeccable production achieves its own kind of perfection.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_viewed": ["0800141660", "B00003JRCQ", "B00G6HO368", "B004SIP7AS", "B004P7CNZO", "B0053Q9DHW", "B000244FDW", "B000GRUQKQ", "B000244FFU", "B0018YCF50", "B001L57ZZG", "B004XVMCMQ", "B00AF82WTO", "B008D1RCHC", "B000Z27HLS", "B000BEZQ0Y", "0767851013", "0486284735", "B0002ZH5PQ", "B0012Q3T6I", "6303921248", "B002XTBE6K", "B001PJRAUS", "B00HYMBAQ0", "B0080QOL1A", "B00062IZ0Y", "B001C4AFOY", "B0012XIGVE", "B002KHNFFS", "B000244FF0", "B0012OVCE6", "B00HYMASS6", "B0009UZGAA", "B000784WMW", "0767020308", "B000LPQ6DE", "B001TJYFRU", "B000FTCEYQ", "B000ZS8GW6", "B005GRF2UK", "B004FM2EL2", "B00G7QPXAI", "149440477X", "B009ERK0SW", "B00006ZXSK", "B0000AUHPK", "B004UOHNCA", "0767020294", "B00094AS9U", "B000Z27HMW", "B002DY9KR0", "B000N4SHOE", "B000683VI4", "193799418X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00G6HO368", "0800141660", "B00003JRCQ", "B005S9EK5Y"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JOHI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZGC68T2JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pride &amp; Prejudice"}
{"description": "Stephen Collins heroically tries to keep up with the (Indiana) Joneses as rakishly charming soldier of misfortune Jake Cutter, who works as a pilot for hire on the South Pacific island of Boragora in 1938. Comparisons withRaiders of the Lost Arkare inevitable, but according to the series retrospective included as a bonus feature on this six-disc set, producer Don Bellisario (Quantum Leap,Magnum P.I., andNCIS) pitched this to the networks before Indy ever cracked his whip. It was only afterRaidersbecame such a colossal hit that ABC saw gold inMonkey. Alas, this series never really took off, but nearly 30 years later, it's a grandly entertaining bit of escapist fare that packs old Hollywood Saturday matinee thrills and adventure into every episode. The colorful characters include Corky (Jeff Mackay), Jake's trusty (when he's not drunk) mechanic and sidekick; Bon Chance Louie (the peerless Roddy McDowall), the ethically questionable French liaison and governor, and owner of the disreputable hangout the Monkey Bar; and Sarah Stickney White (Caitlin O'Hearney), chanteuse and spy. Stealing nearly every scene he's in is Jack, Jake's one-eyed dog, always good for a comical cutaway. You can't beat the Nazis for villainy (check out John Hillerman's outrageous accent in the feature-length pilot episode), butMonkeysteps over the PC line with deadly dragon lady Koji (Marta Du Bois) and her samurai henchman. TheseTalesare told mostly tongue-in-cheek. Expensive for its day, the series nevertheless has a B-movie look, which enhances its hokey charms. In addition to the newly filmed interviews with cast and creators, the bonus features include five immersive audio commentaries, as well as detailed character bios and a series \"fact file.\" Virtually unseen since its original broadcast,Tales of the Gold Monkeyis of more than nostalgic interest. Stephen Collins fans will surely be in--wait for it--7th Heaven.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FJH5MC", "B000F7CMPE", "B000PFUAN2", "B000VDDDVE", "B0007YMWGY", "B000W4TGIQ", "B0012EM5CY", "B00744WZ6W", "B000PFUA9Q", "B003BGZ61S", "B00F3L8P26", "B0002MHDW4", "B003XMKU3Y", "B0009JE6FM", "B001CQONOA", "B00404ME2E", "B00744WZ0I", "B004HHX9T6", "B004I1K2FK", "B001KEGR5M", "B00DYQ1G78", "B0077HQCYM", "B0049GYXCW", "B003CNQPNS", "B000JLTRHW", "B00GX7D5G0", "B0028S110K", "B006MFQ4OS", "B00005JNU5", "B00JK47BHM", "B0014BQR3I", "B000W4KT9G", "B000IONJI8", "B005UFUU6E", "B005DGKBDC", "B000BCCAEQ", "B008L0YMVE", "B000W00XYG", "B001RXDM2M", "B005FQ2HBO", "B003MX91H0", "B00CPTUNR4", "B001JTRKHW", "B003QJC208", "B003KW7CQ0", "B001RXDM1I", "B00BCMT3TO", "B000ELL1QC", "B00GWXI20E", "B00005JMHI", "B005GYXN2M", "B004EXWGJW", "B004HHX9H8", "B00ABMAIM2", "B002BWP2IK", "B000O77SNG", "B00A27O5AW", "B00005V9HP", "B002QU1Z1K", "B00317LM7Y", "B0000639EW", "B000M8N412", "B00IXPWGIS", "B000YENUOK", "B003RHZ6CK", "B000AQ69QS", "B002IFSA8O", "B000N4RAQA", "B003RHZ666", "B009TTGKS4", "B000GW8UAE", "B000CNE09M", "B000GNOSHW", "B000SQFC2M", "B009DS6YGO", "B003L77GWE", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00AWWX7X8", "B000EQ46HI", "B005R2SHIS", "B003H9LIU2", "B005DKS1Z8", "B000WTZ6SK", "B00105307O", "B00L326LTI", "B0007LXP86", "B00IKM5LXG", "B00EEEHL9G", "B0044U9CEC", "B0007YMWFK", "B004VT9JMG", "B00D9EJFZA", "B00005JN8Q", "B0037AGB9O", "6305213283", "6305761078", "B002VA59ZS", "B000BBOUGI", "B00DL48BM6", "B003NH3X5Q"], "bought_together": ["B000F7CMPE", "B000FJH5MC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000F7CMPE", "B0012EM5CY", "B000FJH5MC", "B000W4TGIQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9864}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 28.04, "brand": "GAIAM INTERNATIONAL", "asin": "B00005JOJP", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CsL%2BrEftL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tales of the Gold Monkey: The Complete Series"}

After a murder in the nearby woods, Owen escalates the game by concocting a hoax about a serial killer called the Wolf--a hoax that swiftly turns into reality when the not-so-imaginary Wolf sends threatening e-mails to Owen.Cry_Wolfmixes your standard slasher movie with your standard secret-twist movie to no particularly effect. The Wolf--who wears an orange ski-mask and wields a hunting knife--is a generic boogeyman; text messages just aren't scary; and all the characters combined couldn't muster up an engaging personality. This movie was obviously made to fit a market niche, not because a writer or director had any genuine inspiration or had to exorcise a personal fear--but even for a b-movie this is meager stuff. Also featuring Jon Bon Jovi (Vampires: Los Muertos), Gary Cole (Office Space), and Anna Deavere Smith (The West Wing).--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B004CWLRF4", "B00083FZGI", "B000AM4P9K", "B001UE7D6O", "B001F0TT6A", "B00005JOWW", "B001NPD9LS", "B000C65Z8Y", "B000C6NOY6", "B000EOTVU2", "B00275EHDM", "B0042FUHRK", "B0000VCZNE", "B00006FD9N", "B004VLLWA6", "B00005JMDZ", "0767824954", "B000PMLJMQ", "B000FLKJ2S", "B002JT69IW", "6305238065", "B001AV3BWM", "B00003CXUP", "B0007WQHI0", "B002GHHHME", "B000O77SN6", "B00008LUNW", "B004P7CN3G", "B00575GYT4", "B000RGN2JI", "B004EPZ08O", "B000MEYKBY", "B004P7CNUY", "B0026LQM2Q", "B0007KIFI2", "B001D2WU9I", "B000P0J056", "B00AZTUUQK", "B00005UQ9W", "B000IHY9TS", "B00004YA1F", "0790751658", "0441016154", "6305090564", "B000OCY7TY", "1608871452", "B00111YM5Q", "B000MM0LIM", "B000NO3DLG", "B008JFUNYG", "B004EI2NP4", "B003PIUINS", "B000E8N8H0", "B00IYLX5E0", "B001SSHPLA", "B000O77SMW", "B000WC389G", "B000VSDNFA", "B000OVLBF8", "B0018BA72G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004CWLRF4", "B000AM4P9K", "B001UE7D6O", "B00083FZGI"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JOHF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4108208BHVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cry_Wolf"}

{"description": "Special features abound on this two-disc special edition and there's something for every age. Adults will find the commentary track featuring Jerry Seinfeld and directors Simon Smith and Steven Hickner, co-writer Barry Marder, co-producer Christina Steinberg, and editor Nick Fletcher exceptionally interesting and funny; their dialogue covers movie trivia, technical challenges, descriptions of alternate and cut scenes, strange coincidences like running into and then casting Ray Liotta, and the scientific discovery of bee colony collapse during the time period of the movie's creation. Movie references to Seinfeld's favorite movieThe Graduate, and Seinfeld's musings as to appropriate autobiographical titles for his fellow filmmakers are also covered. A 15-minute \"Inside the Hive\" featurette talks about the cast of the film and details Seinfeld's efforts to recruit \"professional fun-havers\" and delves into how Seinfeld's consistent presence in the recording studio aided in the creation of a palpable rapport between the actors and a unique comic sensibility. A seven-minute exploration of the technology of the film with directors Simon Smith, Steve Hickner, and DreamWorks Animation CEO Ed Leonard speaks to the importance of Halo in allowing close collaboration between Jerry Seinfeld and the filmmakers despite geographical separation and of the vital technological partnership between DreamWorks, HP, and AMD. Three lost scenes and six alternate endings appeal to viewers of every age, as does the 16-minute \"TV Juniors\" segment which presents comic Seinfeld \"newscasts\" on every subject from DreamWorks open calls for movie ideas to sillyBee Movieknock-offs, gags about recruiting animators at border crossings and street corners, and even a discussion of futuristic movie formats like can openers and electric toothbrushes. \"Jerry's Flight Over Cannes\" announcesBee Movieto the motion-picture world as only Seinfeld can, and \"Meet Barry B. Benson\" offers an abundance of bee trivia. DreamWorks Kids offerings include a seven-minute history of bees with tips about how to be a bee-friendly gardener and construct a bee box, an interactive bee trivia game, a personality quiz to determine a viewer's optimum bee employment, a pollination practice game, and an \"Ow Meter\" feature detailing the different kinds of bees and the relative \"ow\" of both their stings and of human swatters like newspapers, boots, and magazines.  Finally, there's a \"We Got the Bee\" music video and a \"DreamWorks Animation Video Jukebox\" with video clips of songs fromShrek1, 2, and 3;Flushed Away; Over the Hedge; Madagascar;andShark Tale.--Tami Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000M343BC", "0783231474", "B001DPHDCY", "B0006JMLRK", "B000MV9026", "B002WJI2QQ", "B004HO6I4M", "B0006UEVT0", "B00005JNQS", "B00003CXJ4", "B005SDUV4E", "B00CWM58WY", "B0000640SC", "B000RMJ4F8", "B004EPZ034", "B0000AOX0O", "B00007LVCM", "B000ION23A", "B000H7JCK0", "B00B7EQPNE", "B0042U94UQ", "B000VBJEEG", "B001ECQ75A", "B00ALMNCLQ", "B00EBBGLFC", "B0013FSL3E", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B00000JL8E", "B008JFUQ16", "B000AY74OG", "B000065V42", "B00CHVJODE", "0783219806", "B000UVKGPI", "B001LPWGFA", "B001GCUO7A", "B002ZG97YM", "6305161887", "B00I6JOD2S", "B0090SI1RM", "B001PR0YEE", "B006JD48LO", "B00HLTD2OE", "B008NNY9QW", "B005LAIH4A", "B004HO6HXY", "B00E9ZATJO", "B00029LO0Y", "B000MNOX9E", "B001OMU6UM", "B0000VV4W2", "B00F522C7C", "B000L22SG6", "B00005JM7T", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B001NLJ3RG", "B00G5G7EXY", "B004OWQTZ0", "B00005JNS0", "B0034G4OYA", "B00JK531ES", "B004LWZW7Y", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00005JMQZ", "B00AFEX83C", "B00AEFXMSS", "B0039N74CW", "B00475B0H6", "B0000VCZKW", "B002ZG99WW", "B0046A9RMM", "B004AKCME8", "B001U3D88M", "B00009YXAW", "B000ROAK2W", "B003H9M1Q2", "B001HN6922", "B005QODEEE", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00E00OGE2", "B005LAIISA", "B0001I561E", "B003UESJF6", "B000CZ0PT4", "B003ZHVJGO", "B005LAIIT4", "B001PR0Y7Q", "B00365F6I2", "B001GCUNWQ", "B002ZG9904", "B000NJMJYI", "B00003CXG7", "B0013FSWT2", "B002GJTYIW", "B003N2CVPY", "B005LAIHW2", "B000LPS2VI", "B00IEXX4KS", "B004G600A4", "B0057J5BMG"], "bought_together": ["B004HO6I4M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004HO6I4M", "B00I6JOD2S", "B000M343BC", "B002WJI2QQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 92477}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.49, "brand": "Paramount Pictures", "asin": "B00005JPS6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51StkuQGVDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bee Movie (Jerry's Two-Disc Special Edition)"}
{"description": "One of the first things a viewer notices aboutCloverfieldis that it doesn't play by ordinary storytelling rules, making this intriguing horror film as much a novelty as an event. Told from the vertiginous point-of-view of a camcorder-wielding group of friends,Cloverfieldbegins like a primetime television soap opera about young Manhattanites coping with changes in their personal lives. Rob (Michael Stahl-David) is leaving New York to take an executive job at a company in Japan. At his goodbye party in a crowded loft, Rob&#x92;s brother Jason (Mike Vogel) hands a camcorder to best friend Hud (T.J. Miller), who proceeds to tape the proceedings over old footage of Rob&#x92;s ex-girlfriend, Beth (Odette Yustman)--images shot during happy times in that now-defunct relationship. Naturally, Beth shows up at the party with a new beau, bumming Rob out completely. Just before one's eyes glaze over from all this heartbreaking stuff (captured by Hud, who's something of a doofus, in laughably shaky camerawork), the unexpected happens: New York is suddenly under attack from a Godzilla-like monster stomping through midtown and destroying everything and everybody in sight. Rob and company hit the streets, but rather than run with other evacuees, they head toward the center of the storm so that Rob can rescue an injured Beth. There are casualties along the way, but the journey into fear is fascinating and immediate if emotionally remote--a consequence of seeing these proceedings through the singular, subjective perspective of a camcorder and of a story that intentionally leaves major questions unanswered: Who or what is this monster? Where did it come from? The lack of a backstory, and spare views of the marauding creature, are clever ways by producer J.J. Abrams and director Matt Reeves to keep an audience focused exclusively on what&#x92;s on the screen.  But it also makesCloverfieldcuriously uninvolving. Ultimately,Cloverfield, with its spectacular effects brilliantly woven into a home-video look, is a celebration of infinite possibilities in this age of accessible, digital media.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B004EPYZQ2", "B00IO9D3ZI", "B00EMMDMKM", "B002SJIO5E", "B0044ZOI32", "B001AR0D4A", "B004BZ5AMS", "B001MVYUQQ", "B003BJO8KU", "B0018AG6X6", "B005LAIGPU", "B00IO8VMB6", "B000PKG8SS", "B003Y5H5GU", "B00BPA2PGG", "B0017U7PT6", "B001YV502C", "B0013FBS20", "B008JFUR10", "B001KZVQJI", "B001CW7ZW6", "B0035WTJFW", "B000Y7U98W", "B003ABZGRI", "B000VDDWEC", "B000VDDWEM", "B002JT69IM", "B00164EAC8", "B002ZG981E", "B00AEFXORM", "B001DZOC3W", "B008SAPC20", "B003Y5H59M", "B00HERVMTK", "B00AVSFIV2", "B0032KNA4I", "B000L212HW", "B001FB55I0", "B0018O4YSQ", "B002ZG997M", "B002ZG9788", "B008G33O0G", "B000VDDWE2", "B00K2CHVSK", "B001GCUO5W", "B005J4TLQG", "B000PC6A3E", "B0027VT9ES", "B001F7MSG6", "B0051T46XM", "B00111YM60", "B001GZ6QEC", "B002HR1W1K", "B004SIPA4G", "B001OQCVII", "B001JNNDBA", "B001GKJ2FC", "B000WQWPKA", "B000OT6V00", "B0021L8UXK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004EPYZQ2", "B00IO8VMB6", "B004LWZW4W", "B005LAIHY0"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPXY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Wm5GO98oL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cloverfield [Theatrical Release]"}

Paterson and her son, producer-screenwriter David Paterson, also recall how an actual incident in David's life inspired the book. A six-minute visual-effects featurette looks at the film's creatures from sketch to computer design to screen, including how the features of the school kids helped shape the creatures. Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb, \"chaperoned\" by producer Lauren Levine, recount their experiences on one commentary track, while the second, by director Gabor Csupo, writer Jeff Stockwell, and producer Hal Lieberman, is drier but informative. Topics covered include praise for young Bailee Madison, how Zooey Deschanel wouldn't have been considered a predator back in the '70s, and the somewhat-controversial marketing campaign that focused heavily on the film's fantasy elements.

{"description": "Nearly 20 years after riding his last Crusade, Harrison Ford makes a welcome return as archaeologist/relic hunter Indiana Jones inIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, an action-packed fourth installment that's, in a nutshell, less memorable than the first three but great nostalgia for fans of the series. Producer George Lucas and screenwriter David Koepp (War of the Worlds) set the film during the cold war, as the Soviets--replacing Nazis as Indy's villains of choice and led by a sword-wielding Cate Blanchett with black bob and sunglasses--are in pursuit of a crystal skull, which has mystical powers related to a city of gold. After escaping from them in a spectacular opening action sequence, Indy is coerced to head to Peru at the behest of a young greaser (Shia LaBeouf) whose friend--and Indy's colleague--Professor Oxley (John Hurt) has been captured for his knowledge of the skull's whereabouts. Whatever secrets the skull holds are tertiary; its reveal is the weakest part of the movie, as the CGI effects that inevitably accompany it feel jarring next to the boulder-rolling world of Indy audiences knew and loved. There's plenty of comedy, delightful stunts--ants play a deadly role here--and the return ofRaiderslove interest Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood, once shrill but now softened, giving her ex-love bemused glances and eye-rolls as he huffs his way to save the day. Which brings us to Ford: bullwhip still in hand, he's a little creakier, a lot grayer, but still twice the action hero of anyone in film today. With all the anticipation and hype leading up to the film's release, perhaps no reunion is sweeter than that of Ford with the role that fits him as snugly as that fedora hat.--Ellen A.

{"description": "For anyone who thought the Oscar-winning documentaryMarch of the Penguinswas the most marvelous cinematic moment for these nomads of the south, you haven't seen nothing yet.Happy Feetis an animated wonder about a penguin named Mumble who can't sing, but can dance up a storm. George Miller, the driving force behind theBabe(andMad Max) movies, takes another creative step in family entertainment with this big, beautiful, music-fueled film that will have kids and their parents dancing in the streets. From his first moment alive, Mumble (voiced Elijah Woods) feels the beat and can't stop dancing. Unfortunately, emperor penguins are all about finding their own heart song, and the dancing youngster--as cute as he is--is a misfit. Luckily, he bumps into little blue penguins and a Spanish-infused group (led by Robin Williams) and begins a series of adventures. Miller has an exceptional variety of entertainment: Busby Berkley musical numbers, amusement-park thrills, exciting chase sequences (seals and orca lovers might like think otherwise), and even an environmental message that doesn't weigh you down. Best of all, you don't know where the movie is going in the last act, a rare occurrence these days in family entertainment. A fusion of rock songs, mashed-up and otherwise, are featured; this movie is as much a musical as a comedy. Mumble's solo dance to a new version of Stevie Wonder's \"I Wish\" by Fantasia, Patti, and Yolanda may be the most joyful moment on camera in 2006.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006UEVT0", "B001DPHDCY", "B0006JMLRK", "B0012EM5D8", "B004HO6I4M", "B004EPZ0AC", "B002WJI2QQ", "B000AY74OG", "B0000AOX0O", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B00005JNQS", "B000RMJ4F8", "B0000640SC", "B005SDUV4E", "0783231474", "B00003CXJ4", "B00CWM58WY", "B0000VV4W2", "B0042U94UQ", "B0039N74CW", "6305161887", "B00AEFXMSS", "B000M343BC", "B00007LVCM", "B001ECQ75A", "B00005JNS0", "B00000JL8E", "B000GUJZ00", "B000056H26", "B008NNY9QW", "B004EPZ034", "B00G5G7EXY", "B000LPS2VI", "B005LAIH4A", "B00F522C7C", "B005LAIISA", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B007FF3HQM", "B000VBJEEG", "B003H9M1Q2", "B00029LO0Y", "B008JFUQ16", "B00005JMQZ", "B00EV1YZ96", "B000ION23A", "B0013FSL3E", "B003ZHVJGO", "B002ZG97YM", "B001NCDFTW", "B004G600A4", "B00009YXAW", "B005LAIHW2", "B00AFEX83C", "B00475B0H6", "B000UVKGPI", "B00ALMNCLQ", "B00HLTD2OE", "B00005JM7T", "B001HN6922", "B000BI5KV0", "B0013FSWT2", "B0030IIZ4M", "B004ODLUGM", "B001GCUO7A", "B005F96UJ6", "B000UFIYOO", "B000G75AZC", "B00005QFE1", "B0000VCZKW", "B00IEXX4KS", "B001THIQFO", "B000A2WAQK", "B001GCUNWQ", "B00B7EQPNE", "B002NZK5SW", "B0007PIDBQ", "B00AOCDDGC", "B000V5IP6U", "B0044RFTD8", "B00AEFXMGU", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00CHVJODE", "B000CZ0PT4", "B006JD48LO", "B0007Z0NYG", "B00EBBGLFC", "B00003CXB4", "B000BMGEJI", "B008YWY0HK", "B0002YLCOM", "B00E9ZATJO", "B004A8ZX3C", "B00I6JOD2S", "B005G3VCYY", "B00CQRN3QI", "B004OWQTZ0", "B0001OGUQI", "B004EPZ01G", "B00005JMFH", "B000GIXEWC"], "bought_together": ["B004HO6I4M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004HO6I4M", "B00EBBGLFC", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00HR3D56O"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 21763}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.51, "brand": "Warner", "asin": "B00005JPCF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51sX2Hrdz6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Happy Feet (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Dracula's DaughterThis cut-rate sequel toDracula, sans Bela Lugosi, turns out to be an unexpectedly sleek and stylish movie. Gloria Holden, tall, dark, and continental, is the aristocratic title character fighting her nature and seeking a cure for her affliction. A sympathetic psychiatrist, Dr. Garth (Otto Kruger), encourages her to \"face her fears,\" but when she lures a pretty young streetwalker to her room to model for a painting, the temptation of her fleshy offering proves too much to overcome. Edward Van Sloan reprises his role as Van Helsing, held by the police for the murder of Count Dracula (the film opens on the final scene fromDracula) but released in the nick of time to help Garth, now at the mercy of the bitter and vindictive vampire. Director Lambert Hillyer makes the most of his low budget, with austere, angular sets and an almost abstract sense of the foggy city night. Holden's mysterious face and tall, willowy body make her an even more striking vampire than Lugosi, and Irving Pichel's offbeat servant is like an American gangster with the breeding of a European aristocrat: thick and thuggish, but always proper. The script falls into the usual rut of Universal's later horror films, losing the mood in the busy plot, but the smooth style and Holden's dignified performance liftDracula's Daughterabove most Universal sequels.Son of DraculaIt was perhaps inevitable that, after playing the Wolf Man, Frankenstein's monster, and the Mummy, Lon Chaney Jr. would round out his horror resum&eacute; with a turn at the great bloodsucker himself (not, as the title would suggest, his son). Looking dapper and dignified under the cape, if not exactly threatening, Chaney plays Count Alucard (that'sDraculaspelled backwards), a mysterious Carpathian summoned to America by a \"morbid\" heiress (Louise Allbritton). Eric Taylor's script is rather clunky, but the story (by horror specialist CurtThe WolfmanSiodmak) is often quite clever, playing like a supernatural twist on a psycho-thriller. Allbritton's frustrated fianc&eacute; Robert Page accidentally \"kills\" her while trying to shoot Alucard (who imperiously stands up to the hail of bullets) and then goes stark raving mad as he watches the dead rise to life and the living disappear in wisps of smoke and morph into creaky stage bats.Future film noir legend (and Curt's brother) Robert Siodmak (The Killers) does wonders with the swampy, misty Deep South setting despite his obviously threadbare budget, transforming the usual clich&eacute;s into moments of inspired melodrama. Only the clumsy antics of the skeptical cops and the plodding exposition spouted by an old Carpathian doctor (he just happens to be the local MD) get in the way of this moody minor horror gem.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005LC4L", "B00005LC4N", "B00005LC4M", "B00005LC4K", "B00005LC4O", "B0000694WM", "B000035Z3K", "B0009X770E", "B00000F62P", "B000WNHTCC", "B00005NSXY", "B0009X770O", "B0016586Q8", "B006TTC5J0", "B00B94VJYW", "B001B9ZVVC", "078323502X", "B003M8NGG2", "B000FWHW8Q", "B00001TZ6Q", "B000U1ZV7G", "0783240961", "B000GRUQJW", "B00000JQB7", "B000FWHW90", "B000UDGOBG", "B00000ILEU", "B00005KHJP", "B00009PY38", "0783233582", "B0000694WH", "B00D9EJFZA", "B00LMCDHMS", "B00LNBQ8UG", "B0034PWPHY", "B0000AUHOO", "B0007R4T26", "B00DOZNGC2", "B000FVQLKW", "B00D9EJFV4", "B0002NRRQU", "B000RXVNCY", "B005D0RDKM", "B00009PY4D", "B008HSK3PE", "B00005R1O7", "B00HFWETZ8", "B000EHSVJG", "B00009NHBC", "B000068TPF", "B000K7VL56", "B00000JMOF", "B000063UR0", "B0002KVULG", "B0000AUHOK", "B002945DUW", "B000UAFDR0", "B000060MVD", "B00009PY4A", "B000A0GOEQ", "B00005AUK0", "B001BSBBGC", "B002DY9KQG", "B000A0GOFA", "B00005RF2C", "B00006G8K0", "B0001CNRLG", "B00009NHC0", "B00FJYXP36", "B009AGEY98", "B0013XZ6SY", "B007Y1NNAW", "B00005NKTH", "B00FMGPWNW", "B007ZFSBWW", "B00DZP1C9K", "B0007R4SZY", "B000RXVND8", "0783240953", "B000VX9WB4", "B000AQKU72", "B000TUDBGG", "B000TLTCT0", "B000R7I48G", "B00ITZXDDY", "B00AWWX8YG", "B00009PY48", "B001BSBBIA", "B00FUABJJQ", "B000A0GOFK", "B000062XEY", "B00005KHJO", "B00000K3U3", "B000AM6OOY", "1559409002", "078324097X", "B00456VHMA", "B007UQ8IQU", "B000BYA5IC", "6305944288"], "bought_together": ["B00005LC4L", "B00005LC4K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005LC4L", "B00005LC4K", "B00005LC4N", "B006TTC5J0"]}, "price": 12.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 40262}, "asin": "B00005LC4J", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518j6eYh1hL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dracula's Daughter/Son of Dracula (Universal Studios Dracula Double Feature)"}

{"description": "This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. As its ratings following the tragic events of September 11, 2001, illustrated,Friendshas matured into television's most beloved comfort show. The peerless ensemble--Jennifer Aniston, a pre-Arquette Courtney Cox, Emmy winner Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, and David Schwimmer--makes a lasting first impression in the first season's 24 episodes, which are presented chronologically on four discs. The perky \"Pilot\" introduces unlucky-in-love Monica, runaway bride Rachel, sad sack Ross, New Age ditz Phoebe, wise guy Chandler, and womanizer Joey. The focus of the first season is Ross's unrequited love for Rachel, but we have these moments to remember: the arrival of Marcel the monkey (\"The One with the Monkey\"); Monica, Rachel, and Phoebe's \"cleansing ritual\" (\"The One with the Candy Hearts\"); the escalating game of shower peek-a-boo (\"The One with the Boobies\"); Joey as Al Pacino's butt double (\"The One with the Butt\"); Ross taking lessons from Joey in how to \"talk dirty\" (\"The One with the Stoned Guy\"); former \"Must-See TV\" stars Helen Hunt and George Clooney (\"The One with Two Parts\"); and Chandler spilling the beans to Rachel about Ross's feelings for her (\"The One Where Rachel Finds Out\"). Though its devoted fans can recite these episodes chapter and verse,Friendsmaintains its sparkle through repeat viewings, a testament to the sharp writing as well as the cast's lightning-in-a-bottle chemistry and lived-in performances. The episodes are presented uncut and extended, with previously unseen dialogue and scenes. And those who hateFriendsand would like to drown the characters in the opening credits' fountain are directed to the episode \"The One with the Boobies,\" in which guest star Fisher Stevens hilariously nails the \"dysfunctional group dynamic ... co-dependent, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffeehouse and you're all like, 'Define me, define me.'\" Among the set's special features are an informative \"Pilot\" episode commentary by the show's creators, who at one point reveal that Monica was originally conceived as a Janeane Garafalo type (how's that for a road not traveled?). More obsessed fans can take a virtual tour of coffee shop Central Perk, the center of theFriendsuniverse, or match wits with the \"How Well Do You Know Your Friends?\" trivia quiz.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000068CNX", "B0000844MI", "B003TNW04Y", "B0000C2IXN", "B003TNW030", "B0006ZM8M2", "B003TNW03K", "B0001AW066", "B003TNW03A", "B005IA9JQ8", "B005IA9JQI", "B005IA9JRM", "B005IA9JSG", "B00005JLEX", "B005MG8UNG", "B00020HAWY", "B000HT3P7E", "B00B1LKXPY", "B008L0YMZA", "B0009VBTP0", "B008L0YN18", "B000TM1CKQ", "B000W91RUG", "B003SNJO5S", "B00005JO9J", "B000ERVK5S", "B0001BS3IY", "B00B04NJ1M", "B002N5N4M6", "B00009Y3RW", "B000NOKFH6", "B00B04NII6", "B00IVLRA62", "B0019CSXAM", "B002N5N4FS", "B0000E32X2", "B001BNFR6M", "B0058JEHTS", "B00005JLIC", "B0002UE1WQ", "B0024FAR6Q", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B00008AOX3", "B00382S9SW", "B00008NV4G", "B0058J3S16", "B0002I838Q", "B000RF1QE2", "B000GETTKM", "B000YA82GA", "B0024FAD8I", "B002BJGYTY", "B001VPJYZ0", "B007C8RZL0", "B003R0MF3A", "B003SNJXMC", "B0000CGNEC", "0792845773", "B0007YXRCW", "B004GJYRFA", "B001A4VH2U", "B0019Z3P84", "B003L77GDS", "B002WC89WK", "B00005JNOG", "B007C8RZQ0", "B000SINT4S", "B00004RFCM", "B0015I2S74", "B00382S9UA", "B0030VANIU", "B008LCRAFC", "B002JVWR7M", "B007C8RZJW", "B006JSXYPA", "B008KZX7W0", "B000R9YLKY", "B005GT3XD6", "B002JVWQSW", "6305428034", "B000HT3P6U", "B00133QNS6", "B00AG473GE", "B000QFCD7W", "B00382S9U0", "B00382S9TQ", "B000WQWPRS", "B0032UYFAQ", "B008LCRA98", "B006WZIB1C", "B003Y5H574", "B00FRILRW0", "B00AEFYM2S", "B000BOH98G", "B0038N9X3Q", "B003L77GE2", "B00133QNSG", "B003VTKZA2", "B002DPPH6W", "B0058JEHSO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005IA9JVI", "B005IA9JQ8", "B00B1LN8WY", "B000068CNX"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 48009}, "asin": "B00005YU81", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HRCAPXNAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Friends: Season 1"}

{"description": "At the heart of the first years of Joss Whedon'sBuffy the Vampire Slayerwas the romance between Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar), slayer of all things evil, and hunky Angel (David Boreanaz), the tortured vampire destined to walk the earth with a soul. The second season ofBuffytook the Buffy-Angelpas de deuxfrom ecstasy to agony in a now-classic plot arc that catapulted the show from WB teen drama to true TV greatness. You see, if the cursed Angel ever experiences true happiness for a moment, he'll revert to being an evil vampire again. And guess what happens after Buffy and Angel finally declare their love for one another and consummate their relationship...Buffyfound its true momentum during the second season, as geeky Xander (Nicholas Brendon) fell in love with popular girl Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter), Willow (Alyson Hannigan) gave up her crush on Xander in favor of werewolf boy Oz (Seth Green), and watcher Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) began a sweetly tentative relationship with computer teacher (and witch) Jenny Calendar (Robia LaMorte). Mayhem came to Sunnydale, though, in the form of evil vampires Drusilla (Juliet Landau) and Spike (drolly wicked James Marsters), who were more than ready to aid and abet Angel as he turned bad. It all sounds like horror-action mayhem (and there are great fight scenes), butBuffytook on its plotlines with amazing depth, intelligence, and humor. And oh, man, the love story! Buffy and Angel's tragic relationship is one of the most heartbreaking you'll ever find. Buffy's final dilemma finds her having to save the world at Angel's expense, and Gellar (who deserves a passel of Emmys for her work) is phenomenal at telegraphing Buffy's swirling conflicts between love and duty. This is some of the best TV ever made, period.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EHSVKK", "B000EHSVLE", "B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVM8", "B000EHSVMS", "B000EHSVN2", "B000I0QLQY", "B000I0QLR8", "B000I0QLRS", "B000I0QLRI", "B000I0QLS2", "B003YF9Q08", "B0009W5J4Q", "B0006IUE16", "B000HD1482", "B000B5XOW0", "B007H9CNOI", "B00466H3CW", "B000ERVJM2", "B000CCBCGM", "B00344EAQO", "B005CM1IIE", "B000GG4Y6O", "1593078226", "B00006J3WH", "1595821651", "B006LG74Q0", "B000JLTRIG", "B00JF5G8WU", "B000OIOPHC", "B0000AQS0F", "B00133QNS6", "1442412097", "B000GG4Y28", "067103541X", "159307963X", "B00001R3O1", "B000BOH986", "B0024FAD8I", "B00133QNSG", "B002U8XW9Q", "0789326302", "B00AMDA2QC", "B00022FWEU", "B003L77GAQ", "B000FL7CAK", "B000QDLSR0", "B00005JLKB", "B00009MEJT", "B009LDCXNY", "1595826106", "B00BBXSPES", "B00006LPCK", "B005GP7ELM", "B000NOKFH6", "1595825584", "B000CNE0SS", "B000KLQUMG", "B0001JXPPC", "B000R9YLKY", "B003L77GWE", "B000BOH98G", "B000F8O2OM", "B0024FAR66", "B000EXDS3E", "B000EXDS3Y", "B000E5KQM8", "B000CNE0TC", "B00006FD9N", "B0017MO11O", "B000667HBS", "B000AJJNFE", "B0000CABIJ", "B00GNAO70K", "B002JVWR4U", "B009LDCWWG", "B00005V6BG", "B0092Q82LC", "B002U0KHME", "B00EIL7E9C", "B003R4ZMN6", "B00242KD1S", "B000LV6VYW", "B00018D42W", "B0048FUUAI", "B000095ZGW", "B00A8KJN8M", "B000V6LSNQ", "B00K0D9760", "B001ILFUA0", "B0024FAD9C", "1593078854", "B000FIMG4U", "B000EBGFPY", "B00079FUI6", "B000062XFG", "B00511N79O", "B0002KVUKM", "B00IKM5LXG", "B002GP7ZVY"], "bought_together": ["B000EHSVKK", "B000EHSVLE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EHSVKK", "B0046XG48O", "B000EHSVN2", "B000EHSVMS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 155101}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 38.99, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B000063IOT", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511DHF4ZPGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Second Season"}

{"description": "M*A*S*Hredux. Sign up for another stint with the 4077th. This three-disc set contains all 24 episodes from the superb second season (1973-74) of the series ranked byTV Guideas among the top 25 television shows of all time. The season opener, \"Divided We Stand,\" is a deft reintroduction to these now iconic characters: bleeding-heart surgeon Hawkeye Pearce (Alan Alda in his signature role), kindred misfit spirit Trapper John (Wayne Rogers), clueless administrator Henry Blake (McLean Stevenson), buttoned-up Frank Burns (Larry Linville), and unbuttoned head nurse \"Hot Lips\" (Loretta Swit). In this episode, a visiting psychiatrist evaluates the 4077th to determine whether the unit \"can function as a team.\" His evaluation can serve as this series' mission statement: \"These impossible people are in an impossible place doing totally impossible things. They're mad--quite mad.\"M*A*S*Hexperienced no sophomore slump from its Emmy Award-winning first season. It continued to subvert sitcom convention with multiple-story episodes such as \"Radar's Report.\" Scenes in the operating room play without a laugh track (this DVD gives viewers the option of watching entire episodes minus the intrusive chuckles and guffaws).M*A*S*Halso tackled such issues as racism (\"Dear Dad... Three,\" \"L.I.P.--Local Indigenous Personnel\"), homophobia (\"George\"), and war atrocities (Hawkeye and Trapper try to get the Army to take responsibility for the accidental shelling of a South Korean village). Not thatM*A*S*Hforgot how to be funny. \"Five O'Clock Charlie\" and \"For Want of a Boot\" are strictly for laughs. Hawkeye and Hot Lips memorably exchange flu shots in \"Carry On, Hawkeye.\" Loyal viewers will note the emergence of several supporting characters, including Jamie Farr's Klinger and William Christopher's Father Mulcahy. One also sees the (to some) unfortunate transformation of Gary Burghoff's savvy, crackerjack clerk Radar into a na&#xEF;ve innocent.

{"description": "A Hollywood scandal springs to life in Peter Bogdanovich's livelyCat's Meow. In 1924 the immensely powerful publishing magnate William Randolph Hearst held a yacht party that ended with a gunshot. Between Hearst's influence and that of his glitterati guests (including Louella Parsons and Charlie Chaplin), no satisfying account of what happened ever made it to the public.The Cat's Meowreconstructs one of the more whispered-about possible scenarios and has quite a bit of fun doing so. Cast and crew alike skewer 1920s Hollywood decadence and, by extension, today's. Eddie Izzard is a boldly odd casting choice as Chaplin, but he succeeds, refusing to fall back on Little Tramp mannerisms. There are several other good performances, but best of all is the cool-as-sherbet Joanna Lumley as the deliciously jaded Elinor Glyn. The script is a strong one, never stooping to the excesses of its characters--Bogdanovich's take is far from the most lurid allegations of what happened that weekend.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["034532739X", "B000F3UAFC", "0783116764", "B001DE29SS", "B002I5GNZQ", "B001RXDLZ0", "B00IXD2N1K", "0618154469", "B00ECN3B98", "B00GWXI2MC", "0070251142", "B00K6D1S7A", "B00IBIIQTU", "B00079HZUM", "B000EU1Q1I", "B002VWNICC", "B006KH6CF4", "B004GGQMTW", "B0009A40EI", "B00HZVX14O", "B00004Y3WF", "B00005QD8Y", "B0024FAG6W", "B00006FD9P", "B000059HAO", "B000KWZ7JC", "0615572693", "B00008979K", "B00AEFY66U", "B000M341SC", "1493557378", "B004YCKKFK", "B00005JKGX", "B006GL8O0U", "B00009PY32", "B002K0WBXM", "B00067BBLY", "B00009QUH4", "B005MQ58MW", "B00009RXKB", "B00AEFYIDG", "B00005BCK9", "B00D9BNOKK", "B000QGDXG6", "B00ARA4SLU", "B00EKR61EI", "B00007G1YP", "B000092T3P", "B0000AKY7F", "B000E6ESXK", "B0000DZTOM", "B0009S4IKG", "B000GI3RMY", "B00CUKTHES", "B000EBD9TO", "B00CX7OX6U", "B0036TGSR6", "B000056BP3", "B00015HVN8", "B0087VCGI8", "B00H9L26AA", "B001N44BVQ", "B00A1O0G3G", "B000TLTCT0", "B00005V5NU", "B0007TKNLA", "B003B3V0RA", "B001I2EQUO", "B0001US85S", "B009B1EPQ4", "B0001EFV7C", "0792840445", "0788815490", "B00G7QPXUI", "B004OB2EYQ", "B008XB2UCE", "B004CLYJEQ", "0573696241", "B000QXDFS0", "B00AZMFO6I", "B00116GEJ8", "B00HUCF420", "B00BLF9FYA", "B006OFN0SE", "B00BGARGR8", "B000002SNJ", "B00007ELD1", "B0011NVC8Y", "B00005JLRE", "B00005JKNF", "B0002DB52M", "B000JLTRG8", "B00FC1ZC9Q", "B001D8W7EK", "B00007CVS4", "B002YNQEFG", "B00121QGPY", "B00005BCKF", "B00ELMZ60M", "B00005OBAL"], "bought_together": ["034532739X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DSSA54C", "034532739X", "0618154469", "B00005QD8Y"]}, "price": 10.86, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 53287}, "asin": "B0000694ZI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51wWhrXElaL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Cat's Meow"}

{"description": "The Best Arbuckle/Keaton Collectionliterally defines the phenomenon of genius in the making. While showcasing the formidable slapstick talents of Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle as director and star, this 12-title compilation is also a remarkable study of Buster Keaton's rapid evolution as a silent comedy master. Made in swift succession from 1917 to 1919, these chronologically sequenced two-reelers serve a dual purpose, re-establishing Arbuckle as an underrated talent (his career was tragically curtailed by an infamous rape scandal, despite his eventual exoneration), while crediting his mentorship of Keaton from Vaudeville veteran to inspired movie pioneer. The \"Great Stone Face\" had yet to emerge (though it's evident in Keaton's 1917 debut, \"The Butcher Boy\"), so Buster's innately amusing countenance is wondrously animated here, especially in \"Coney Island,\" which doubles as an illustrious postcard from a bygone era. The final collaboration, \"The Garage,\" was Buster's favorite, and it's easy to see why: with a giant turntable, fire hoses, grease buckets, and all varieties of gag-laden shtick, it's a sublime (and like most of these films, well-preserved) example of two gifted comedians at the peak of their craft.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00097DXG2", "B00049QQ78", "B000A7DVMM", "B000E1EHQI", "B004XEEMA8", "B00007L4MK", "B003H221M8", "B0002HOEJY", "B0082CDGSG", "0306801787", "B007AAEZ7W", "0810942275", "B009CSVQB8", "B00652FG38", "B002TCRQNG", "B0041CGOZ8", "B00JRHW4GK", "B001FD6MJO", "B00652FG60", "1497372755", "B00652FG4M", "B00J84NGBE", "B000WC8CLU", "B000F4TMIW", "B005SDB8H8", "B001E18222", "B004IMDCK6", "B00IPAORL0", "B008BWFOXC", "B00D8HNRBG", "B005DKS1W6", "189166106X", "1578069637", "B00005QW5A", "B002A2B348", "B00D9BNOKK", "B00FNRA7VW", "B0097RU0LG", "B0016A2FHE", "6305701245", "076365079X", "B0040QYROA", "B00AIA89ZA", "B00005ALM3", "B003YBNNMY", "B000LC4C0Q", "B00ARKYSWE", "B003H221MI", "B00A1AU6VM", "B000E6ESX0", "B000B5XORA", "B00D2CRP42", "B005IA9JWW", "B00004Z4W3", "1557046646", "B004XEEMAI", "B00005ALM4", "B00009Q4VX", "B001O2UTRW", "B001M9ELJY", "B00005O5CD", "0810876825", "B002NTDX6O", "B005BYBZKY", "0312496958", "B00ALTQRUC", "B00GBT61YS", "B00BF36ZXC", "B000E5LC58", "B004HI4RYG", "B000021Y7O", "B0056HTEKO", "057121276X", "B000AM4PJK", "0691004420", "B00000JWWZ", "B000056N7W", "B0002CHIDS", "0806513039", "B00009XN8Y", "0306803879", "B004YOEGA8", "B0031REQHM", "B0006GAONG", "0786477113", "B000AM4PJ0", "B004YOECXY", "B000XA5K0M", "B000A59QJ6", "B000KGH0DO", "B001GOEYAG", "B00AOCDE7U", "B003Y7F1QE", "6305211264", "B0013XZ6R0", "0025115707", "B004ASDNP2", "B007UQ8ISI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00097DXG2", "B004XEEMA8", "B000E1EHQI", "B001FD6MJO"]}, "price": 18.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 191951}, "asin": "B00006IUIU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51hAcdRvi6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Best Arbuckle/Keaton Collection"}

{"description": "This earnest movie about a door-to-door salesman with cerebral palsy  (based on the true story of Bill Porter) could have been cloyingly sweet,  but a sense of humor and the clear, unpretentious performance of William  H. Macy keep it from drowning in sentiment.Door to Doorfollows  Porter from when he first gets his job (by convincing a skeptical sales  manager to give him the worst route the company has) in the mid-'50s,  to his brief retirement in the late 1990s, when door-to-door salesmen  became outmoded by catalogs and the Internet. The depiction of how Porter  became part of the lives of his customers may feel a little pat, but the  portrait of Porter himself--particularly how his persistent independent  spirit was also a wall between him and others--is honest and affecting.

{"description": "With a new time slot (8:00 p.m. Saturdays) and three first-season  Emmys&#xAE;,All in the Familywas primed for greatness, and these 24 episodes  represent the series at its best. Carroll O'Connor leads the perfect cast as  blue-collar bigot Archie Bunker, and the standout classic is \"Sammy's Visit,\" in  which black, Jewish rat-packer Sammy Davis Jr. visits the Bunker home, where  he's hilariously horrified by Archie's prejudicial ignorance. The script was  written by comedian Bill (\"Jos&#xE9; Jiminez\") Dana, and to borrow Archie's phrase,  it's a pip, as Sammy turns Archie's racist remarks on their ear to the delight  of young liberals Gloria (Sally Struthers) and husband Mike (Rob Reiner).  Sammy's parting kiss on Archie's cheek is one of the series' all-time  highlights. Then there's Burt Styler's Emmy-winning script for \"Edith's  Problem,\" in which Archie's \"Dingbat\" wife experiences the mood swings of  menopause (another first, along with impotence in \"Mike's Problem,\" in the  series' taboo-busting candor). A showcase for Jean Stapleton (who deservedly won  her second consecutive Emmy), it also demonstrates (as does \"Archie and Edith  Alone\") the hurtful repercussions of Archie's unintentional cruelty. Edith's  Archie-baiting cousin Maude (Bea Arthur) is introduced (\"Maude\" is a pilot for  the character's spin-off sitcom, which premiered in '72), and creditmustbe given to John Rich, who directed all 24 episodes (winning an Emmy for  \"Sammy's Visit\") with a flawless sense of ensemble chemistry, precision timing,  and lasting political relevance. This season earned seven Emmys overall,  including awards for O'Connor and Struthers. Given such a wealth of sitcom  glory, it's a shame these DVDs are devoid of retrospective features.--Jeff  Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002E58FT2", "B002E58FUG", "B002E58FTM", "B002E58FTC", "B002E58FU6", "B000TD2KY2", "B000255LG6", "B000TD0PHG", "B005KK2FTO", "B00465I13S", "B00008R9MC", "B00007KK5J", "B000068V9Y", "B000CCBCCG", "B000068V9X", "B000MGTQ6G", "B00008EY6N", "B0007OCG74", "B0000BV1XX", "B000YGGNGK", "B00IJZW35I", "B001DSNEME", "B00005JLIC", "B000AMJG5I", "B000MGBSH6", "B00GOC760U", "B000A0GXGK", "B001OXLGK0", "B0000B1A5A", "B00096S480", "B00007KK5I", "B0000DFZ5O", "B00008NV4G", "B0002NY8R6", "B000286S42", "B0001O3YHQ", "B000NJMJHA", "B00GLT2SOA", "B000G0O5JG", "B002JH2EJM", "B000QUEQ6I", "B008L36520", "B0001NBNIY", "B00D2UMHB0", "B00GOC74OI", "B000BOH8YQ", "B000B5XOTS", "B00DJYK1XU", "B0002Y4T7O", "B0002W4SX6", "B00D2UMHSI", "B0002JZT5U", "B000A9QKSM", "B000A0GOQ4", "B000MEYKAA", "B000EGDAO8", "B000YKYT1M", "B000CELOW2", "B0085Z6Z2O", "B0011N19HI", "B000WQWPSW", "B001DMVZJ4", "B000291Q3Y", "B00009VRF0", "B0000E32X2", "B008KZX7W0", "B0085Z6ZD8", "B0001AVZDU", "B001DMVZJO", "B00A2L1CJK", "B0007Y08P6", "B000PHX5KU", "B00005JO3P", "B00D2UMI7I", "B00000F5W8", "B000HIVIOM", "B0007WQHFS", "B0006IUDYY", "B00008EYBH", "B000K7UBXE", "B000BVM1TG", "B008K1PWMW", "B0058J3S16", "B0009B16TO", "B0000V4906", "B008VNI9EW", "B0007KTBJO", "B0002NY8PI", "B007JVM69Q", "B002FLOTFO", "B00FM4S7P4", "B000E1MXWI", "B00IP965IO", "B009V2KO9K", "B0001ZMWXW", "B000KGGIL4", "B000EBGFQI", "B000BITV1A", "B00FFARI7I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002E58FT2", "B008HUSFTS", "B002E58FTM", "B000WN5DYS"]}, "price": 10.29, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 91142}, "asin": "B00007KK5K", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nSvglNU8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "All in the Family - The Complete Second Season"}

Ron White's scotch-and-tobacco-fueled, fatalistic world view gets things off to a good start.

(\"There needs to be a teenage driver's lane lined with tires and mattresses.\") Main event champ Jeff Foxworthy offers fresh material about the act of ice-fishing as an out-of-body experience for fish, describes the bizarre sight of a leaf blower among items confiscated by airport security and, of course, renders his trademark re-re-re-definitions of what constitutes a redneck (\"a glorious absence of sophistication\").

{"description": "Friends' fourth season, one of the very best and most consistently satisfying, begins with Chandler urinating on Monica's leg to relieve a jellyfish sting. It ends with the two in bed and in lust. In between are several benchmark episodes and rich, character-enriching plot developments that keep this series from coasting on comfort level. Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) agrees to become a surrogate mother for her long-lost brother (Giovanni Ribisi). Chandler (Matthew Perry) \"crosses the line\" after falling in love with Joey's girlfriend, and is forced to spend one memorable Thanksgiving in a box. Rachel (Jennifer Aniston in what should have been her Emmy year) desperately pursues the recently divorced Joshua (then real-life squeeze Tate Donovan). Joey (Matt LeBlanc) and Chandler trade spaces with Monica (Courtney Cox) and Rachel, and then, with provocative (albeit offscreen) sapphic compensation, return to their humble abode. And Ross meets the warm and wonderful Emily (Helen Baxendale), setting the stage for a London wedding and classic season finale that revitalizes our rooting interest in the whole Ross and Rachel thing.  Especially jolly good in this two-parter are the scene-stealing British character actors, including Hugh Laurie as the unfortunate airline passenger seated next to Rachel as she wings toward London to tell Ross she loves him (\"And by the way, it seems to be perfectly clear that you were on a break,\" he tries to reason with her), and Tom Conti and an absolutely fabulous Jennifer Saunders as Emily's squabbling parents. AsFriendswinds down, it is a pleasure to return to one of its glory years.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000844MI", "B0000C2IXN", "B003TNW030", "B0001AW066", "B000068CNX", "B003TNW03K", "B003TNW02G", "B0006ZM8M2", "B003TNW03A", "B005IA9JRM", "B005IA9JQI", "B005IA9JSG", "B005MG8UNG", "B005IA9JVI", "B00020HAWY", "B00B1LKXPY", "B005SJGIV8", "B000ERVK5S", "B008LCRA98", "B008LCRABQ", "1932273190", "B000F9T70U", "B000HT3P7E", "B000TM1CKQ", "B00005YU82", "B000GTLB6C", "B000GETTKM", "B0009CTVLS", "B004STBF5S", "B00005AVCA", "B0044LYRFA", "B0006Q93AQ", "B000NOKFH6", "B000HT3P6U", "B004STBFPS", "B0058JEHSO", "B005IA9JQ8", "B001U9BS2O", "B0013FSL16", "B002BAW6I6", "B00005JLFT", "B001BNFR6M", "B000A7PKGW", "B000BNTM46", "B001DHXT5C", "B0038M2AQE", "B0011UBDS6", "B000068CNY", "B000G1R3A8", "B003SNJY1C", "B008LCRAC0", "B002BAW6HW", "B003Y5H574", "B004STBF2G", "B000SINT4S", "B000A0GOQY", "B00AEFY2LO", "B000NA1PUG", "B0007R4SWC", "B0009WFEEG", "B0019CSXAM", "B003R4ZMQI", "B004GJYRFA", "B000FL7CAK", "B00004RFCM", "B00018YCIM", "B008LCRAFC", "B000RO6JZO", "B001QU9RR0", "B00AEFY2E6", "B00K7IPFSM", "B000AAF1TU", "B000N6SE4U", "B0058JEHTS", "B0009VBTP0", "B001DDBCUA", "B0001ZMWXW", "B00AEFY2WI", "B00003CXMP", "B00007IG1M", "B003CN5SAY", "B001MVWMIO", "B0024FAD8I", "B00EIJTLK4", "B0017VG68G", "B001FB4VZS", "B000P6YNSO", "B000640WGM", "B0077PTWY6", "B000NA2BEU", "B000W91RUG", "B0001O3YLM", "B000FIMG5Y", "B002JVWQSW", "B0002XVQSU", "B000R9YLKY", "B002XMGGK6", "B000FUTVLO", "B00BGI086Q"], "bought_together": ["B0000844MI", "B0000C2IXN"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000844MI", "B005IA9JQ8", "B000068CNX", "B005IA9JRM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 37682}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 18.25, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B0000996IS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51rEjBc9E8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Friends: Season 4"}

{"description": "Tom Selleck is at his iconic best in this made-for-cable remake ofMonte Walsh, a poignant Western about the passing of an American age and the people attached to it. Selleck plays the title character, a career cowboy whose rhythms are aligned with the seasons and the annual herding of cattle from Wyoming to Texas. Faithful to his ways, loyal to his best friend (Keith Carradine), and satisfied with his part-time romance with an ailing, aging saloon girl (Isabella Rosselini), Walsh is happy until his 1890s world rapidly unravels.

{"description": "Though it bears little resemblance to the original 1969 thriller starring Michael Caine, the 2003 remake ofThe Italian Jobstands on its own as a caper comedy that's well above average. The title's a misnomer--this time it's actually a Los Angeles job--but the action's just as exciting as it propels a breezy tale of honor and dishonor among competing thieves. Inheriting Caine's role as ace heist-planner Charlie Croker, Mark Wahlberg plays straight-man to a well-cast team of accomplices, including Mos Def, Jason Statham, and scene-stealer Seth Green in a variation of the role originally played by Noel Coward. As the daughter of Croker's ill-fated mentor (Donald Sutherland), Charlize Theron is recruited to double-cross a double-crosser (Edward Norton in oily villain mode), and once again, speedily versatile Mini Coopers play a pivotal role in director F. Gary Gray's exhilarating car-chase climax. It's perhaps the greatest product placement in movie history, and just as fun the second time around.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB86A", "B00AEFY0XE", "B0000AUHPB", "B0019EXZY4", "B00004Z4WR", "B005LAIGLE", "B001MTYRKC", "B000ZS8GWQ", "B000J3OTT6", "B00AEBB8LA", "B000P0J0BK", "B00BB67UNW", "B004HO6HWA", "B004P7CMVE", "0767818024", "B004ULNJIU", "B003Q6D2B4", "B001F12J0C", "B001QB9H10", "B004EPYZP8", "B008E70EES", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B0062P3392", "B001TODCII", "B002GSXKP6", "B000BTITKS", "B0010YVCB6", "B000K7UBSO", "078322933X", "B001ILHY1I", "B0007P0XBO", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B003UESJHO", "B000AP04FG", "B0002ZDVEU", "B000JYW5BE", "B000W1V5VU", "B00008AOVL", "B00005JLIF", "B000093FLA", "6305657947", "6304711891", "B003L20IG0", "B00DU22OI6", "B005LAIGRS", "B008JFURII", "B002XMGGK6", "B002DU39GW", "B00HEPC0TS", "B005LAIILM", "B000P0J0C4", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000W9DTG6", "B000M341QE", "B002NZK5UU", "B000X1Z0C4", "B00AEFZ2DG", "B000FKO5QK", "B001UV4XGA", "B00023B1LC", "B000GFLKF8", "B00005JLSB", "B000ENC5YW", "B00AEFY5B6", "B001J710Z2", "B002ZG99H2", "B000VWYJ86", "B00005JN0T", "B002ZG999U", "6305428115", "B00000JGNP", "B00140PK82", "B002ZG9864", "B002GIBVVQ", "B004H83IFK", "B00BEIYLO8", "B00005UQ9T", "6304806434", "0783240295", "B005LAIGXW", "B00003CY0V", "B000KF0GWW", "B000P0J0EW", "B00005JLX2", "B002VECM6S", "B002ZG97RE", "B002O3Z4XY", "B000E5N684", "B002ZG980U", "B00005B6JZ", "B001N44BVQ", "B000FKO3WG", "B00005JKBC", "B007REV4T8", "B00E8RKHWW", "B001DZOC6Y", "B0012KJ0DK", "B002GHHHP6", "B00005JN0W", "B00AQSN7HE"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBB86A", "B00AEFY0XE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000AUHPB", "B00AEBB86A", "B00004Z4WR", "B005LAIIHG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8732}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B0000B1OFL", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X762iDLcL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Italian Job"}

{"description": "Divorce number 2 is immediately on the cards as the fifth season opens with \"The One After Ross Says Rachel.\" As of this point, Ross's character undergoes some extreme personality changes (which apparently lost David Schwimmer many female fans). His incessant whining drives all the Friends to distraction, especially in \"The One Where Ross Moves In\" with Chandler (Matthew Perry) and Joey (Matt LeBlanc). Later things get uncomfortable both at work and at home when he goes through a period of rage (\"The One with Ross's Sandwich\"). While all this downplays his failed relationship with Rachel (Jennifer Aniston), the real idea is to allow focus on the secret pairing of Chandler and Monica (Courteney Cox) after a night of passion in London. This made for a return to the show's appealingly silly atmosphere as poor Joey is caught in the middle of everyone's secrets. Building to \"The One Where Everybody Finds Out,\" the silliness pauses for some genuinely touching interplay between Perry and Cox. The previous year's semi-serious thread about Phoebe's (Lisa Kudrow) birth gets forgotten fast: to distract the viewer she's introduced to Gary (Michael Rapaport) in \"The One with the Cop.\" This leads to some hilarious parodying with Phoebe interrogated about apartment hunting, and the guys excited and then scared in \"The One with the Ride-Along.\" She's more than over him by the time of the two-part finale, \"The One in Vegas,\" though, especially since she missed out on London. Just in case fans thought Chandler and Monica had permanently stolen the spotlight, a cliffhanger shocks expectation again with Ross and Rachel bursting out of a chapel....--Paul Tonks", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003TNW030", "B003TNW04Y", "B0001AW066", "B0000844MI", "B003TNW03K", "B0006ZM8M2", "B003TNW03A", "B000068CNX", "B003TNW02G", "B005IA9JQI", "B005IA9JSG", "B005IA9JQ8", "B005MG8UNG", "B005IA9JVI", "B00020HAWY", "B000ERVK5S", "B00B1LKXPY", "B0058JEHTS", "B008LCRA98", "B000HT3P6U", "B00ELHCTPM", "B007C8RZJW", "B004STBFPS", "B008LCRABQ", "B005SJGIV8", "B004STBF5S", "B008LCRAC0", "B000OHZKZ4", "B0000542C7", "B004GJYRFA", "B0013FSL16", "B002BJGYTY", "B005D0OHA6", "B000HT3P7E", "B000NA78SE", "B0002UE1WQ", "B007C8RZQ0", "B0009WFEEG", "B000G1R3A8", "B001TKJDNA", "B008LCRA7K", "B000NOKFH6", "B0050MB5P2", "B0058JEHSO", "B0009OL7Z4", "B00BUWD7SO", "B000QFCDAO", "B0001907BW", "B00AMHFPXS", "B004STBF2G", "B00166UFSY", "B008L0YMWS", "B001DJLD2G", "B000NA2BEU", "B00008YGRV", "B000AQ68Z0", "B0002I84FS", "B00AEFY2LO", "B002HK9IMW", "B00AEFY2WI", "B002GOAH1U", "B00IWTVDUW", "B001AKTZW8", "B001OQCUYI", "B00AMHFMOK", "B0007R4SWC", "B003Y5H574", "B001AQBGM4", "B001MVWMIO", "B0017VG68G", "B00G3XHH68", "B005LAIIB2", "B00004TJKK", "B00BUWD7E8"], "bought_together": ["B003TNW04Y", "B003TNW030"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005IA9JRM", "B003TNW04Y", "B000068CNX", "B0000844MI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15672}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 32.5, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0000C2IXN", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TA9GY89XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Friends: Season 5"}

{"description": "John Le Carre for the Internet generation, the BBC'sMI-5is a smart combination of TV cop show and George Smiley-esque espionage shenanigans that pulls no punches in its depiction of an MI-5 (the British CIA) team fighting a covert war on the streets of London. This is adult, post-watershed drama clearly inspired by the hard-hitting style of shows as24andThe Sopranos. The strong ensemble cast is led by charismatic Matthew MacFadyen as Tom Quinn, star spy of \"Section B,\" the counterterrorism branch headed by Harry Pearce (Peter Firth). Keeley Hawes, David Oyelowo, and tough-cookie Jenny Agutter make up the team. And as with its British predecessors,CrackerandPrime Suspect,MI-5(titledSpooksoriginally) also delves fearlessly into the characters' turbulent personal lives, here given an added twist by their constant need to deceive even those they love. The six episodes of the BAFTA Award-winning first season tackle a variety of tough issues, including religious fanaticism, racism, governmental cover-ups, and, naturally enough, the lingering shadow of Irish terrorism. Throughout, the show strikes a fine balance between a James Bond-ian techno-obsession with spy gadgets and more character-based action, with crisp writing and direction that ratchets up the tension a notch further with every episode. The final cliffhanger is an unforgettable TV moment, and one that leaves viewers agog for next season.--Mark Walker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00064AME4", "B000BP86Y6", "B000IJ7AEC", "B0013BDQ42", "B001EHF3RS", "B002HWRZTI", "B004AUCDLU", "B004TPJN2S", "B006WZID9C", "B000FL7CBY", "B00GD7UO6E", "B004FM2EL2", "B00JJRLFTU", "B000KF0DVQ", "B00AATGDUC", "B009YX8MKO", "B006JY3OBI", "B00D7AM2YW", "B00IBKXQJS", "B000GW8U4A", "B00FRQ0HOQ", "B00ECXJC1E", "B001RTKKS0", "B00D49YDDY", "B00BQXTCVS", "B005G172Q8", "B00H4ZEFTQ", "B005DVIOIG", "B00HUAGYF8", "B0041QSZFG", "B00D49YBTA", "B0083HXKAY", "B00DW5IKN4", "B00BCXW106", "B000YRY8BG", "B00J5LXT44", "B004AV5H3U", "B00IBKXP8A", "B00C888LOO", "B0011KQSZ4", "B0028AEO0M", "B00005YUNK", "B002RB56ZY", "B00GWXI1F0", "B00HGE90Z4", "B00J3M54AW", "B003X82D1K", "B00AHREQMY", "B00GAXASK8", "B001VLBDB2", "B009DS3VQA", "B002WN8IS4", "B00EBBGKTE", "B00447G2NE", "B0011VJRVU", "B008FTWT7K", "B001B43IW6", "B0009H97IA", "B001GTXZOM", "B009DS6YGO", "B00GWXI2EU", "B00DNR3FN6", "B0012YN29Y", "B005K8QIS0", "B00D49YDR0", "B005LAJ140", "B0009H97JE", "B00KPP6R9S", "B004132HZS", "B000S6LP5K", "B006MK4QKW", "B009DS31ZG", "B00KL3TSC2", "B00KL3TS7M", "B00AQYUY5Q", "B0050N0US4", "B001D7T6N6", "B004QOB8SO", "B005DJ7AYC", "B00E3UN44W", "B008OTTTP6", "B00ECGHM5O", "B00KHA99BY", "B00GHH9I62", "B00A27OJ94", "B006JY3OH2", "B001B1Q2UY", "B00ANGICCO", "B00HUCF420", "B00BEZEDNU", "B0050MB3RM", "B00268EY5Q", "B00C12ZISE", "B0009UZGAA", "B0010X746O", "B002MVI3HC", "B000FDECH4", "B006W7L4EG", "B00GWXI28Q", "B00175GAKQ"], "bought_together": ["B00064AME4", "B000BP86Y6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BP86Y6", "B006WZID9C", "B002HWRZTI", "B004TPJN2S"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 80880}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 32.0, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0000E32UZ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RXB1NQ5EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "MI-5, Vol. 1"}
{"description": "Even under the heavy censorship of 1946 Hollywood, Lana Turner and John Garfield's libidinous desires burn up the screen in Tay Garnett's adaptation of James M. Cain's torrid crime melodrama. Platinum blond Turner is Cora, a restless sexpot stuck in a roadside diner married to mundane middle-aged fry cook Nick Smith (Cecil Kellaway) when handsome drifter Frank (Garfield) blows her way. It's lust at first sight, a rapacious desire that neither can break off, and before long they're plotting his demise--but in the wicked world of Cain nothing is that easy. Garnett's visual approach is subdued compared to the more expressionistic film noir of the period, but he's at no loss when he films the luminous Turner in her milky-white wardrobe. She radiates repressed sexuality and uncontrollable passion while Garfield's smart-talking loner Frank mixes street-smart swagger and scrappy toughness with vulnerability and sincere intensity. Costar Hume Cronyn cuts a cold, calculating figure as their conniving lawyer, a chilly character that only increases our feelings for the murderous couple, victims of an all consumingamour fouthat drives their passions to extremes.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001KXZGNW", "B001KXZGOG", "B002GSXKPQ", "B0087ZG7OI", "B002GSXKQA", "B007FQXEVY", "B001KXZGO6", "079073219X", "B003UN2IAY", "B008D1Q1VU", "B008D1R52Y", "B005F265CU", "B005EVY8MQ", "B007FQXEQO", "B008D1R52E", "B00004XPPK", "B000FFJYAW", "B002VWNIAY", "B001D8W7EK", "B003UN2I4K", "B0047BXQZY", "B0045HCJ9E", "B0008ENIAC", "B0049985XW", "B00871C09S", "B004H83IFU", "B00406UJZG", "B00AEBB97S", "B006H37PXY", "B0080JG2GE", "B00023P4GA", "B00AEFXD1O", "B000BQ5IXW", "B00AEBBA7W", "B0001HAGTW", "B008D1Q1TM", "B000FFJYAC", "B000244EYW", "B00007ELD1", "B0045HCJHG", "B001D8W7EU", "B00AEBB89C", "B00AEFXRWO", "B004UOHNCA", "B00005A0QS", "B00DNQM7N6", "B00023P4II", "B000CC1TNI", "B000FFJYAM", "B002945DUW", "B000ECX0O2", "B0087ZG7R0", "B005H8G78O", "B003B3V0RA", "B000087F79", "B0086IMNRQ", "B001PO54V0", "B004XKVP7K", "B000244EWO", "B000B8384Q", "B0024FAG80", "B00006RCO1", "B000025RE7", "B006H37P2K", "B0007ZEO8C", "B00466JALY", "B000FFJYA2", "B00004W229", "B00DBE97S8", "B0050FXDDQ", "B00005RDRL", "B00027JYLM", "B00AMSQBNK", "B008BSM1XC", "B00008LDNZ", "B000CNE088", "B004UOHNAC", "B0006HBV3C", "B00553K8DQ", "B00005JKF6", "B00AEFXN9G", "B0008ENID4", "B00023P4FQ", "B0035Q636Q", "B000PKG7CU", "B0000549B0", "B00003CXBU", "B0047BXR1C", "B00012L786", "B006FE83UE", "B00006RCO2", "B00BQ412GU", "B001PO550A", "B000244F2S", "B000EXDSBQ", "B000PMFRVU", "B00AATGDW0", "B0006HBV28", "B003ZEQMH8", "B0006Z2NE0"], "bought_together": ["B001KXZGNW", "B001KXZGOG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001KXZGNW", "B003ZEQMH8", "B008D1Q1VU", "B005F265CU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 36043}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0000EYUCU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CHTNvd9UL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Postman Always Rings Twice"}

{"description": "Unlike the originalSaturday Night Livecast, theIn Living Colorensemble was definitely ready for prime time. But, was prime time ready forIn Living Color? This subversively funny 1990 sketch-comedy series boldly went whereSNLfeared to tread, particularly in matters of race relations and cultural stereotypes. Series creator Keenen Ivory Wayans was hot after his hilarious blaxploitation spoof,I'm Gonna Git Ya Sucka. ButIn Living Colorwas hotter. According to a \"Looking Back\" segment included in this three-disc set, it took him a year to sell the pilot. He fronted a young, gifted, and mostly black cast, including David Alan Grier, Tommy Davidson, Damon Wayans, Kim Wayans, and T'Keyah \"Crystal\" Keyman. \"James\" Carrey and Kelly Coffield were the white Garret Morrises.Like the first season ofSNL,In Living Colorplayed provocateur, with such politically incorrect sketches as \"Homeboy Shopping Network,\" \"This Old Box,\" and \"Ted Turner's Very Colorized Classics.\" Other sketches, such as \"Riding Miss Daisy,\" have a stick-it-to-the-man brazenness. Don King, Mike Tyson, Milli Vanilli, and Arsenio Hall are easy targets, butIn Living Colordid not spare such icons as Richard Pryor. There is the inevitable Oprah roasting, but also a brilliantStar Trekspoof, \"The Wrath of Farrakhan.\" Among the first season's breakout characters are Damon Wayans and David Alan Grier's finger-snapping \"Men on Film,\" and Damon's Homey D. Clown. Carrey struts his stuff as \"female\" bodybuilder Vera DeMilo. Coffey is a scream as Samantha Kinison and Andrea Dice Clay. While much of the topical humor has dated, sketches such as \"Michael Jackson Potato Head\" are timeless. The fun of revisiting this groundbreaking series is watching these fearless and talented performers go for broke, and make the most of their unlikely opportunity.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002PYTD2", "B0007PAM0G", "B000A9QKSW", "B000E6ESA8", "B0002KPHVU", "B0006N2F04", "B00BNAE138", "B0006N2EZU", "B00AJXO5DQ", "B000BYA4I8", "B002LCOGBE", "B000068V9Y", "B00018YCIM", "B00005JO2V", "B000A88EUK", "B00EALTX8A", "B002XUBDXS", "B00CPTUNY2", "B001DSNELU", "B0002O7Y8U", "B0058JEHTS", "B000CELOW2", "B002OOK6WM", "B0041QSZGA", "B001NFNFM6", "B00009Y3RW", "B004MWLXTO", "B000JLQPYK", "B00008PHCU", "B0038Q9Q94", "B0001BKAP8", "B00003CXKD", "B004SIP9E2", "B00007KK5J", "B0000ZMH92", "B004P7CMZ0", "B008FRJDVC", "B000LXGXXE", "B000FL7C8W", "B00I099K4U", "B00007KK5I", "B00005JOHC", "B0001907BW", "B00AEBBADG", "B0009S4J2S", "B0072BNKHA", "B000A59PM4", "B000068V9X", "B0006Q93CO", "B00BTYRB2G", "B00AEFXPG2", "B0000B1A5A", "B0013LRKQC", "B000053VBC", "B004WO9OOS", "B00080ZG2O", "B004GTVU78", "6305310335", "B000MEYKAA", "B000KG4BTU", "B000035P5I", "B001AEF6HM", "B007C8RZR4", "B002GSXKO2", "B0012018OE", "0790732149", "B003YOZNGA", "B000BYA4JW", "B005CGI4EG", "B0000TWMWA", "B001JAHSAA", "B0009S4J50", "B00014NE9E", "B000FFJYC0", "B00008YGRV", "1558908390", "B002RSEN4M", "B00014NEAI", "B00005JKMQ", "B0041QSZS8", "B000G6BL88", "B007C8RZXS", "B000006MYV", "B00006LPGP", "B0058EE6O4", "B000P0J0E2", "B0009ETCOW", "B0036TGTEI", "B0002KE2FW", "B000FFJZO2", "B0009HBPEO", "B00AEFXQLQ", "B0009VRHLU", "B00005RIIY", "B00005T30A", "B001JV5BAS", "B0006BAWYM", "B002LCQBM6", "6304354398"], "bought_together": ["B0002PYTD2", "B0007PAM0G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00152M7ZI", "B0002PYTD2", "B000A9QKSW", "B0007PAM0G"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 68458}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.0, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B0000TPA60", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R48G512HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "In Living Color - Season 1"}
{"description": "After being fired from UPN's primetime line-up, this animated series based on Scott Adams's nationally syndicated comic strip has received a well-deserved promotion to DVD. Dilbert, the bespectacled potato-shaped engineer with the upwardly mobile tie, is the poster boy for the corporately disenfranchised. Though Adams's cynical, cubicle eye-view of corporate culture was somewhat co-opted byThe Drew Carey Show, animation gives the series a surreal flourish not possible in a live-action series. In the first episode, for example, we can see the devastation wreaked by an \"all-natural\" anthrax lozenge, and an interoffice riot sparked by budget cuts. Co-executive producer Larry Charles, whose resume includesSeinfeldandMad About You, wisely preserved Adams's Kafka-esque comic vision. Dilbert may \"just want to make the world a better place,\" but that is difficult in a workplace where the Pointy-Haired Boss insists his employees first come up with a name for an as-yet-undeveloped product, employees literally give their souls to the company, and an evil cat reigns as an evil director of human resources loathe to help employees. As the old saying goes, it's funny because it's true. The voice cast are excellent hires, with Daniel Stern as Dilbert, Larry Miller as the clueless Boss, Kathy Griffin as sardonic co-worker Alice, and Chris Elliot as Dogbert. You don't have to have a refrigerator, cubicle wall, or computer festooned with yellowedDilbertstrips to appreciate the series. It will strike a beleaguered chord in fans ofOffice SpaceandThe Office, or anyone toiling for a company that loves misery.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008EY6Q", "B000ABKHZC", "B0019N8P2W", "B001FT4PF6", "B00006IGVK", "0740777351", "B000ARXF7I", "1449423094", "1449429386", "0740705318", "B007QD0VOE", "B000667HDG", "B00C7E3E7S", "1449430295", "1449408192", "1449410189", "1449427758", "B000GFLEKY", "B006WDWBK6", "B0002PYSB0", "B00DY9528Y", "B00AIANIPQ", "B00DOZNH58", "B000EBGE9Q", "B008L0YMWS", "B000UZDO6M", "B008412UQ4", "B001PU8N12", "B00AQ590KU", "B001G0MFFG", "B0007CILMA", "B002WJHDJI", "B000HWZ4LG", "B0001MZ7K0", "B009AVC9BI", "B00D7AM6B6", "1449415881", "B00F77MAC2", "B00BCRRA8U", "B0010YO0IS", "B006CR2OD6", "B0000AUHQE", "B00F77MAO0", "B004H0M2ZU", "B000KWZ1PC", "B005LAJ18G", "0740738054", "B00DYEBLYI", "B0062KMDWU", "B0017INRG8", "B003H6KRM0", "B000NDI3Q2", "B008AITJ7O", "B00008YGRS", "B00CO8WWS4", "B003CNQPNI", "B00BM2JVAA", "B000UX6TIY", "B005WXTZJM", "B00BI5YEWG", "B000MTEFVE", "B0000TAYWA", "B00158K0V0", "B00069L0Z4", "B000WC38NM", "B000BXJ1Y2", "B002DYKPF6", "B00BTJV9RO", "B006VC3LDO", "B000E3L7F0", "B00005JN8Q", "B00E5G03I4", "B000FA57HG", "B00F4NPBI4", "B00775R45A", "B000F7CMPE", "B001IO07XM", "B004U7MQW4", "B007ZFR67I", "B002C3GTLC", "B001MT7ZI8", "B000FI9OEU", "B003XL6EJO", "B002I9TZHA", "B001DZOC78", "B00316DA9I", "B00961EO24", "B000MEYKA0", "B000MGBLFK", "B000G6BL88", "B009CI8S6Y", "B000E0OE3K", "B0092QU0YY", "B000FEBWTE", "B002DH20Q0", "B005DCJ2TU", "B0053TWV5K", "B000ZBEOHY", "B008JBJAM6", "B007CO5MVE"], "bought_together": ["B00008EY6Q", "B0019N8P2W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00GOC74PC", "0740777351", "B00008EY6Q", "1449427758"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 153976}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.99, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0000WN15E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41lCbd6yFlL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dilbert - The Complete Series"}

{"description": "Based on the bestseller by John Grisham,Runaway Juryis a slick thriller that's exciting enough to overcome the gaps in its plot. The ultimate target has been changed: Grisham's legal assault on the tobacco industry was switched to the hot-button issue of gun control (no doubt to avoid comparison toThe Insider) in a riveting expos&#xE9; of jury-tampering. Gene Hackman plays the ultra-cynical, utterly unscrupulous pawn of the gun-makers, using an expert staff and advanced electronics to hand-pick a New Orleans jury that will return a favorable verdict; Dustin Hoffman (making his first screen appearance with real-life former roommate Hackman) defends the grieving widow of a gun-shooting victim with idealistic zeal, while maverick juror John Cusack and accomplice Rachel Weisz play both ends against the middle in a personal quest to hold gun-makers accountable. It's riveting stuff, even when it's obvious that Grisham and director Gary Fleder have glossed over any details that would unravel the plot's intricate design.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783226942", "B000P5FH3K", "B002NZK5R8", "B00AEFXYJA", "B002NZK5UU", "0767810872", "B002NZK5VO", "B0000694XY", "630542828X", "B00AEFXT1S", "B0006HBZBA", "B0045HCJ8K", "B0000C3I8M", "B004EPYZP8", "B0010YSD7W", "B00096S49Y", "B000063US3", "B000R4SMCW", "1558908382", "B001NY4WYC", "B003ASLJIQ", "6305428115", "B00005B6JZ", "B00005JL8F", "B00005UQ9T", "B00008EY9G", "B00008K77D", "0800141806", "B00005JPT0", "B00003CXFV", "B000P0I4O4", "B000CEV3M8", "B00441GYPG", "0790732149", "B000SFOW8I", "B000TJ6PBK", "0783240295", "B001I2EQUY", "B000055Y0Y", "B000NTMA0Q", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B002AT8KAG", "0790730979", "B00003CY5G", "B0038Z5T4Q", "B004SIP9RO", "B004YCKKFK", "B002AS464Q", "B00AMSM9DG", "0783226888", "B00AADAK5W", "B0031OCY2E", "B002DU39GW", "B00000K3TU", "B002LMV7R0", "B0013D8LBS", "B000GFLKF8", "B000CEXEWA", "B00008L3S6", "B00005ATZT", "B00AEBB9UK", "6304806434", "B002AT8K9W", "B00AEFXEGS", "B003ASLJQ8", "B0043X1FNQ", "B000BNX3B4", "B001CC7PLM", "B002QW7AMG", "B000JYW5BE", "B000Y11B8U", "B001HVZOB6", "B00BLN4UKQ", "B005NKIPUY", "B00015YVDG", "B00H91LWDC", "0792844874", "6305657947", "B003L20IG0", "0780618548", "B00DWZHTOU", "B003Q6D2B4", "B000ENC5YW", "B00GUO2SKA", "B0010YVCB6", "B00009WVSL", "B000G5SILC", "B000F8DV1M", "B00FQRZ6EM", "B000OYAT3U", "B00AEFXIIW", "B008JFURII", "B00005JNQA", "B002O3Z4XY", "B000059XTK", "B00005JN5E", "B001ECDVK4", "B000K7VHQ4", "B00000JGHL"], "bought_together": ["B000P5FH3K", "0783226942"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001I2EQUY", "B000P5FH3K", "B00AEFXYJA", "B002NZK5VO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 38867}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.67, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00014NEZI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X52Z0CBSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Runaway Jury (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "A marvelous reinvention of the costume epic,The Lost Princeis Stephen Poliakoff's absorbing study of the turbulent years leading up to and during World War I, seen through the percipient eyes of a scarcely remembered royal child. Extensively researched, impeccably cast, beautifully filmed, written and directed by Poliakoff himself with masterly economy and restraint, this is a timely reminder that original, intelligent drama can work as prime-time entertainment while appealing on multiple levels; and there isn't an escaped soap star in sight. Johnnie, the prince kept hidden away by his parents Queen Mary and George&nbsp;V for fear that his epileptic fits and idiosyncratic ways might draw unwelcome attention, is not presented as a tragic figure. His view of the great events that shatter his family and change the world forever is direct and uncluttered. Poliakoff celebrates his apartness--and that of all children who are different--as a force for good, without judging the standards, protocols, and contemporary medical theories that kept him on the periphery of society. The series makes the most of its well-chosen locations, and from Johnnie's garden at Sandringham to the assassination of the Russian imperial family, it maintains a hypnotic and elegiac quality The acting is first-rate, too. Gina McKee is profoundly moving as Johnnie's devoted nurse Lalla, and Miranda Richardson's Mary is an extraordinary performance, the controlled facade of single-minded focus occasionally fracturing to reveal a flash of humanity. This production is exquisite in every respect.--Piers Ford", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006Q93H4", "B000EMGF2Q", "0767827775", "B0054DPLUC", "B001B1Q2UO", "B00BXTH44C", "B000EHQUGC", "B004XYOQU4", "B000V02CO6", "B00005O7N8", "B000EOTELI", "B000NTM9ZW", "B001C4AFOY", "B000JLTS80", "B000A8AXXG", "B007A2O3FO", "B000GH3CQG", "B0001KL5M6", "B0012IV3Q4", "B00GJT2OWS", "B00BQXTDIU", "B000F4RHC0", "B000G6BM0K", "B000EHQU1M", "B00336M8DK", "B004H1UAIA", "B003AND1SM", "B0000AQS3P", "B005T0OY5S", "B009L2EW5W", "B00005AUJT", "B001L57ZZG", "B000M2E32M", "B0059XTV4Y", "B000FL7CC8", "B000784WNQ", "B0080QOL10", "B000FL7CBY", "0767812115", "B000BITVAG", "B000EBD9VC", "B00005JOA0", "B004XC5LQE", "B003WEAVZU", "B000RF7XYY", "B00HUAH14Q", "B000096FU4", "B000089QEM", "B00KB01NQO", "B00062IZ0Y", "B000GIXLUC", "B004JMSIQS", "B003CP1T50", "B005DVIQ2K", "B00DL48BM6", "B007TBJD1K", "B000Z8H0IC", "B00F1BFRA6", "B0046ZYEUW", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B0009PVZM8", "B009T6CXG0", "B0077PBPVE", "B00DQN6IOK", "B000EHQU1C", "B00JX3SHIC", "B00BHO0STG", "B0009PVZL4", "B00BYN27G2", "B005CFBZX4", "B00GPWEPZ8", "B004D45NYC", "B00GM7STPI", "B00005YUNK", "B00C888NRO", "B00E3UN66I", "B00A4E8E78", "B000BKDO6Q", "B00ARX2VZW", "B0007LFPJ8", "B00C888OFA", "B00J0IN6Z4", "B001C0I626", "B007HW8U2Y", "B00AZMFO6I", "B002CWKTUA", "B0074FUSFG", "B000TLTCPY", "B00G15MDI0", "B00H4ZEFTQ", "B00BBXSP84", "B008RO6PJQ", "B000FUF7BM", "B000FQIRXQ", "B00008DDRZ", "B005S9EJ14", "B003WEAW04", "B008UQUS26", "B000ERVJQ8", "B00000JYWU"], "bought_together": ["B000EMGF2Q", "0767827775"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EMGF2Q", "0767827775", "B00GJT2OWS", "B00005O7N8"]}, "price": 14.86, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18340}, "asin": "B00015HXDG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EHE1FAJ6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lost Prince"}

{"description": "Lots happened behind the scenes between seasons and early on in the seventh year ofFriends, leaving audiences speculating this might be the last. Matthew Perry became seriously ill again, and returned looking more emaciated than ever. Courtney Cox regained weight, but despite finishingScream 3happily, things were already rocky with David Arquette. Much was made in the press about Aniston marrying Brad Pitt, of course, but the real news (allaying fans' fears) was NBC's expensive renewal of the cast for two years at $750,000 per episode each (more than six times their previous increase). On-screen, at least there was Chandler and Monica's engagement lasting the whole year, despite predictable ups and downs (e.g., \"The One with the Truth About London\" revealing that Monica fancied Joey). By the time we finally get to \"The One with Chandler's Dad\" (Kathleen Turner!), it seems inevitable that the two-part finale will be an insane mess--but with a happy-ish ending. Sure enough, \"The One with Monica and Chandler's Wedding\" features Gary Oldman joining in the chaos as Chandler repeatedly goes missing.Other star turns in the year wereSeinfeld's Jason Alexander as a suicidal office manager, Susan Sarandon as soap queen bitch Jessica Lockhart, Denise Richards as one of Ross and Monica's endless number of cousins, and Winona Ryder as a surprise old friend, prompting \"The One with Rachel's Big Kiss.\" But perhaps the most telling installment of this weirdly atmospheric year was \"The One Where They All Turn Thirty.\" It suggested that maybe the Friends were all getting too old to carry on living their frivolous lives the same way after all.--Paul Tonks", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003TNW030", "B003TNW03K", "B0006ZM8M2", "B0000C2IXN", "B003TNW03A", "B003TNW04Y", "B0000844MI", "B000068CNX", "B003TNW02G", "B005IA9JRM", "B005MG8UNG", "B005IA9JSG", "B005IA9JQ8", "B00020HAWY", "B005IA9JVI", "B00B1LKXPY", "B000HT3P7E", "B0009WFEEG", "B008LCRABQ", "B008LCRA98", "B000TM1CKQ", "B0002I84FS", "B005SJGIV8", "B008L0YMZA", "B008LCRAC0", "B000T22PVG", "B000GRUMQY", "B0001907BW", "B000A7PKGW", "B002BJGYU8", "B001TKJDNA", "B000G1R3A8", "B000RGULLA", "B004GJYRFA", "B0058JEHTS", "B0010X5X4O", "B000W91RUG", "B001PQZYQI", "B000HT3P6U", "B0024FAR6Q", "B000J4QW7W", "B002N5N4FS", "B000NOKFH6", "B002BJGYV2", "B0007R4SWC", "B0044LYRFA", "B008LCRAFC", "B003CN5SAY", "B00GUOJJUW", "B0019CSXAM", "B00005JM3A", "B000EHSVN2", "B000OHZKZ4", "B002BJGYTY", "B00029RTCG", "B001RXDM2C", "B000ERVK5S", "B003L77G6A", "B00005JOHC", "B0001CCXZW", "B008FTWT7K", "B000NA78SE", "B004GJYRA0", "B0090SI53C", "B000J3OTSM", "B001992NWO", "B000HT3P60", "B004EPZ0BG", "B00005AVCA", "B00G3XHH68", "B003TFAJ18", "B000EHSVMS", "B00BEIYMZ6", "B000NA2BEU", "0767827686", "B002N5N5NE", "B000EHSVLE", "B005Z9MFRC", "B008X6N8KW", "B00009Y3RW", "B009LDD1X0"], "bought_together": ["B003TNW030", "B003TNW03K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005IA9JQI", "B003TNW030", "B003TNW04Y", "B005IA9JRM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12450}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 15.98, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B0001AW066", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SyXqeC-bL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Friends: Season 7"}

{"description": "Samurai I: Musashi MiyamotoToshir&#xF4; Mifune defines the quintessential samurai in Hiroshi Inagaki's 1954Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto, the first feature in a trilogy based on the epic novel by Eiji Yoshikawa. As in Kurosawa's classicSeven Samurai, which appeared the same year, Mifune plays a brash and ambitious peasant who desires fame and power as a swordsman. His dreams of glory in war sour when his army is routed and he becomes hunted by the authorities, but the \"tough love\" attentions of a kindly but severe monk help him develop from a hot-tempered outlaw to a thoughtful swordsman. Inagaki's somber color epic is very different from the energetic action of Kurosawa's films. The sword fights and battles are practically theatrical in their presentation, staged in long takes that emphasize form and movement over flash and flamboyance. Mifune brings a sad, almost tragic quality to the samurai warrior Musashi Miyamoto, whose dedication proscribes him to a lonely life on the road. Though the film stands well on its own, its stature takes on greater significance as the first act of Inagaki's stately, contemplative epic of the professional and spiritual development of Musashi.Samurai II: Duel at Ichijoji TemplePicking up whereSamurai Ileft off, Toshir&#xF4; Mifune's samurai in training Musashi Miyamoto is a wandering swordsman who hones his skills in a succession of duels. When he defeats a succession of students from a local school of martial arts, he becomes marked for death by the school elders and is attacked in a series of cowardly ambushes. Romantic threads from the first film become further complicated when the virginal Otsu (Kaoru Yachigusa) and the sad courtesan Akemi (Mariko Okada) meet and discover their rivalry and Musashi earns himself an archenemy, an ambitious young swordsman named Sasaki Kojiro (Koji Tsuruta) who vows to defeat Musashi to make his name as the finest fencer in all of Japan. Inagaki ably manages the rather complicated plot with unexpected ease (subtitles are employed to help English viewers make a few narrative jumps) while he charts Musashi's education in compassion and humility and his internal struggle with his conflicted love for Otsu. The direction is still as distant and unostentatious as in the first film, while the color and settings become richer and more pronounced: studio-bound locations take on the quality and delicacy of paintings. The dramatic centerpiece of the trilogy, an epic pre-dawn battle where 40 swordsmen ambush Musashi, uses darkness and landscape to great dramatic effect as figures seep in and out of the pictureSamurai III: Duel at Ganryu IslandToshir&#xF4; Mifune is confidence supreme and humility incarnate as the mature samurai master Musashi Miyamoto in the final film of Inagaki's sprawling trilogy. Now a legendary swordsman whose latest quest is to save an isolated village from rampaging brigands (shades of Seven Samurai), he remains haunted by the memory of Otsu (Kaoru Yachigusa). Meanwhile the ruthless and increasingly jealous Kojiro Sasaki (Koji Tsuruta) plots his battle royal with Musashi to prove who is the finest fencer in Japan. Inagaki weaves the web of subplots into a series of grand confrontations, among them the most exciting battles of the trilogy: Musashi's skirmish with the army of cutthroats while the village erupts in a fiery inferno around him, and the sunset duel between Musashi and Kojiro on an isolated beach, the two warriors taking on mythic dimensions silhouetted against the sun setting over the surf. Inagaki's delicate use of color throughout the series becomes most pronounced in this final sequence, where the glow of orange and red adds dramatic flourish to the twilight battle. Inagaki's reserved, restrained style and Mifune's melancholy performance--his granite face and stocky stance the very essence of somber wisdom and sad assurance--bring a gravity and seriousness to the drama that ultimately illuminates the personal cost of Musashi's supreme skill as his story ends on an elegiac but hopeful note.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000K0YM0Y", "B00687XNNK", "B000AQKUD6", "B000G8NXYG", "B0009WIE2A", "B00005B1ZL", "B0007989YS", "B00005JLEJ", "B001BEK8E2", "B002E01MBA", "B006H3KQSK", "B004XQO8MS", "B000C6NP7M", "B000067IY6", "B000K0YLZ0", "B00B2BYXSQ", "B00065GX0K", "B001PCNZJU", "B000056NWP", "B000NOK0H6", "B00K5EJHGO", "B000BB14I0", "B00180R072", "B0001UZZSG", "B0080WPADW", "B0038P1D0K", "B005D0RDPM", "156836427X", "B000FS9FIK", "B000ASATM6", "B00005JLMU", "B000FDECGA", "B00006IUI5", "B004KDYR7A", "B0026VBOJM", "B000ROAPTA", "B0017MO0U6", "B000VARC3C", "B0012SY0E6", "B0000B1ODQ", "B000BR6QCI", "B000AQKUGI", "B00A8QDI3M", "B0000A02TW", "6305028699", "B001L28H10", "B00EO2I6OM", "B002ZG4Q5W", "B00019JR5Y", "B002KYIAKQ", "B00B2BYXYA", "B000AQKUC2", "1590309863", "B000LC3IQ0", "B00EZY9Q0W", "B006C1S1DY", "B00004W3HF", "B0030A6ICG", "B00009V7OB", "B00K2LC44M", "B00687XNQM", "B004ODLUJO", "B0006N0E4S", "B004S801ZO", "B000WEH74G", "B000ZLUWAM", "B00HE01030", "B00CEIOHPU", "B00005JLV7", "B003DVB7F0", "B0019X400S", "B0089N4GBY", "1590309847", "B00004XQN5", "B005VU9LO0", "B00B4FU65Y", "B003152Z4U", "0780021045", "B000FILVO6", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B0000A2ZNX", "B00ENTX7JU", "B009VL2AZM", "B002AFX53W", "B003N2CVQ8", "B005ND87RM", "B0047P5FU4", "B000AQKUFO", "B00A8QDHYW", "B000PKG6O4", "B0006HC0FU", "B00175GAG0", "B000S2CCRY", "B008Y5OWO8", "B0006HC0F0", "B004VW4V9E", "B0009IW8CQ", "B001MEJY9G", "B0047P5FTA", "B005JJCMN0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000G8NXYG", "B000K0YM0Y", "B001BEK8E2", "B00008RH1H"]}, "price": 41.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 185413}, "asin": "B0001UZZT0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KSmXjU2RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Samurai Trilogy Box Set (The Criterion Collection)"}

{"description": "In the annals of acting, 2004 will be remembered as a banner year for Jamie Foxx. Before his acclaimed turns inCollateral, alongside Tom Cruise, andRay, the Ray Charles biopic, he produced and starred in this made-for-cable movie about former gangbanger Stan \"Tookie\" Williams. Directed by actor-turned-filmmaker Vondie Curtis Hall (Gridlock'd),Redemptiontracks Tookie's rise as co-founder of L.A.&#x92;s notorious Crips, fall to death-row inmate, and rise again to Nobel Prize Nominee. Tookie&#x92;s reminiscences to journalist Barbara Becnel (Lynn Whitfield), while he is on death row, frame the story. Virtually unrecognizable from his days onIn Living Color, a buffed-up, dreadlocked Foxx gives an effectively low-key performance, while Whitfield also shines in a less rewarding role.Redemptionmay not have the grandeur ofMalcolm XorThe Hurricane--and Tookie's transformation from man of violence to man of peace happens too quickly--but his story is just as inspirational.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Since its network debut in 1960,The Andy Griffith Showhas been a viewer favorite thanks to its folksy, nostalgic charm and memorable cast, both of which shine in this set featuring the series' debut season. Originally spun off from an episode ofMake Room for Daddy(both series shared producers Sheldon Leonard and Danny Thomas),The Andy Griffith Showcentered around the lives of small-town sheriff Andy Taylor (the marvelously dry Griffith), his son Opie (Ron Howard), cousin and deputy Barney Fife (multiple Emmy winner Don Knotts), and the other gentle eccentrics of Mayberry (which was based on Griffith's real hometown). But while other \"rural\" programs poked fun at its characters (The Real McCoys,The Beverly Hillbillies),The Andy Griffith Shownever stooped to stereotypes, preferring instead to draw its humor from the fine writing and cast, which counted Frances Bavier as Aunt Bee, Howard McNear as Floyd the Barber, and Hal Campbell as Mayberry's benevolent drunk, Otis, among the first season ensemble. All 32 episodes (including the epilogues, which are rarely aired in syndication) are compiled on this four-disc set, which regrettably lacks any supplemental features.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007Y08P6", "B0009UC7MK", "B000B8I9ZY", "B000BYRCF6", "B000EBGE82", "B000FSME10", "B000HWZ4IY", "B003SLEDJC", "B008KZX7W0", "B005SQRYOG", "B000EGDANO", "B00FWMVVF4", "B000B7HZUK", "B00004TGYD", "B008L36520", "B000291Q3Y", "B00009VRF0", "B00HVFA36I", "B001E6JC30", "B0009OUBPQ", "B000HWZ4J8", "B0001DMXEC", "B0006Z2L4W", "B001LM64VK", "B0000AUXVS", "B001992NZG", "B0018E03CW", "B0000V4906", "B002ZTLVXY", "B0009I7NH6", "B001BN4WHW", "B00A2L1CKO", "B001AZIRY0", "1558530983", "B001DMVZJ4", "B000002T6S", "B000005KXI", "B00000HY5X", "B00650RX72", "B004NJC0RK", "B002E58FT2", "B0001IN0BC", "B00198X0YK", "B000YKYT1M", "B001NRPQKI", "B0007KIFK0", "B00HR2HTRQ", "B000NA21YA", "B0007TKNHO", "B00H8KC1N4", "B00A2L1CJK", "B001DHXT4I", "B00005JLIC", "B000068V9Y", "B001JAHPMG", "B001992NXI", "B000EXZFS0", "B000A9QKSM", "B002NZK5WS", "B0050MB5AC", "B000O59A1G", "B00016XN48", "B00016JE5U", "B000RTAUZO", "B00009QG5P", "B008VNIBTK", "B00005JOEB", "B0025X4PAQ", "B0002NY8R6", "B000FSMEB0", "B000SSQ7JW", "B008H6GH9W", "B000PHX5KU", "B008VNI9EW", "B003IB0FTE", "B000EHSVB4", "B000000ECZ", "B0000C2IVT", "B000CCBCHQ", "B000MGTQ6G", "B0038SUBDC", "B00007KK5J", "B00650RWGO", "B00274SIVK", "B0000BV1XX", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B001OXLGKA", "B005DDN51A", "B00018D404", "B008VNI9TC", "B00GOC75YW", "B0085Z6ZD8", "B003CNQPMY", "B0009B16TO", "B005D7E7Y0", "B00650RWZA", "B001E549KC", "B008L3653O", "B00FFARI7I", "B0000B1A5A"], "bought_together": ["B0007Y08P6", "B0009UC7MK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007WFY4S", "B0007Y08P6", "B0009UC7MK", "B000NA21YA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7076}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.0, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B0002NY8PI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61XCYJEZSAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Andy Griffith Show - The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "Winner of the Audience and Director&#x92;s Awards at the Sundance Film Festival, the deeply affecting MY FLESH AND BLOOD follows one remarkable family&#x92;s most tumultuous year as it confronts a litany of daily routines, celebrates life&#x92;s small pleasures, and copes with major crises. Who says you can&#x92;t choose your family? \"I think when I found that I could survive raising four kids, that it wasn&#x92;t that far of a leap to add another one,\" says Susan Tom of Fairfield, California, who has done more than just that, adopting 11 special needs children. For a single mother who receives only limited help from the state, Susan gives her kids love, hope, and as close to a normal childhood has possible. Her limits are tested, however, when her angry teenage son threatens one of his siblings. And after another child&#x92;s condition becomes erratic, the entire family learns that living for the moment is the keystone to happiness. Tenderly directed by Jonathan Karsh, MY FLESH AND BLOOD presents a family portrait like no other--a bittersweet and unforgettable experience filled with unexpected humor, stirring pathos, and an optimistic view towards morality.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FBFZ1I", "B000QRIJVE", "B000CDSS18", "B000ADWDHK", "B000B5XP24", "B000F6ZE1E", "B00375LBK8", "B000R8YC22", "1557987017", "1557988021", "1558745157", "B00AW27NME", "B00005RIY3", "B004GEB69K", "044050838X", "B00092A1IA", "B0044M2OS6", "146271854X", "0061131768", "B00009XN4G", "0151014124", "B001QIP5C8", "B007FIILF6", "158270399X", "B00A4TMLKE", "B000RKQ3K4", "B007N9Y4TY"], "bought_together": ["B000FBFZ1I", "B000QRIJVE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FBFZ1I", "B000QRIJVE", "B000CDSS18", "B00009XN4G"]}, "price": 16.86, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 201786}, "asin": "B0003JAO8Q", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51q9TN7OcNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "My Flesh and Blood"}

{"description": "A sizable hit with both teen audiences and sports-themed movie enthusiasts, 1984'sThe Karate Kidhad the right combination of heart and action to spawn three sequels of varying quality between 1986 and 1994; all four features have been packaged together in this three-disc set. Though plot elements varied from film to film, the core story (and the series' greatest strength) remained the same--the relationship between a wise Japanese martial arts teacher (skillfully underplayed by comedian Pat Morita) and his young American student (Ralph Macchio in the first three films, and future Oscar winner Hilary Swank in the final entry,The Next Karate Kid). The first of the Morita/Macchio matchups remains the best of the four features, with excellent performances from both leads and director John G. Avildsen (who also handledRockyand the first twoKidsequels) expertly balancing the emotional moments with the pure excitement of the martial arts tournament that serves as its finale.The subsequent sequels with Macchio seemed pulpier (especiallyThe Karate Kid, Part II, with its rekindled wartime romance subplot), and the inevitable come-from-behind competitions lacking the impact of the original; 1994'sThe Next Karate Kid(directed by Christopher Cain) put a slight spin on the formula by replacing Macchio with belligerent teen Swank, but it too seems like a retread of the first film. Still, the messages inherent to each film--finding one's inner strength, trusting your heart--should ring true to new generations of younger viewers. Fans may find theCollectionlight on supplemental features--while all four films are presented in anamorphic widescreen format, only the original (which was previously released in pan-and-scan only) offers commentary by Avildsen, Macchio and Morita and several making-of featurettes; the three sequels, packed into two discs, offer no extras.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002ZG99CC", "B004FQX5C0", "B002ZG99CM", "B000TWJ2CG", "B0087F7VSY", "B001ER4CPM", "B0054OGQM8", "B000068TPB", "B000068QPY", "B0006J28MI", "B001DDBD5E", "B0009RCPY8", "B000065V42", "B001SXZ7T2", "B001LMAK9C", "B000P0J0A6", "B001E75QH0", "B004SIPAFK", "B00HF98SJY", "B000Y11B7Q", "B0000639EX", "B00028HBES", "B0006GAOGS", "B000P0J09W", "B0000639HQ", "B000065V3H", "B003PIUIJ2", "B00008DDXA", "B00FAI3JE6", "B002SAMMFG", "B0008JIJ2E", "B00F4FFO8E", "6305428387", "B000PHX5P0", "B00008G8LM", "B00AMSQBP8", "B00JPQ1HX4", "B007I6JZVE", "B000059H9A", "B000067FP8", "B0057RCFQS", "B00JK531ES", "6305428050", "B00A7AN2SK", "B00005T7HZ", "B008R65XKG", "0767827686", "B00015YVD6", "B001DJLD2G", "B000ZBEOEC", "B000FC2FQA", "B003UN0752", "B00005A8XX", "B00H5NY7O0", "B0000DIXDR", "B00008979O", "B007STBUHI", "B0000696HW", "B0002O7XUE", "B000BUE5E6", "B0015RRNN4", "B006JTS6XY", "B003UESJLK", "B001GLFPWK", "B000P6XQ50", "B00008WFU5", "B0060FXDCG", "B000209KMW", "B0009X75QU", "B000RJO56E", "B00C7MW5HU", "B001DPHDBA", "B00008WFU4", "B00386F0D0", "B008D1Q1WE", "B0000C6HI0", "B00AEFXMMO", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00009OWI3"], "bought_together": ["B002ZG99CC", "B00G5G7EXY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001CCSI2W", "B0008JIJ2E", "B002ZG99CC", "B0038M2RLC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6745}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 22.88, "brand": "Sony Pictures", "asin": "B0006OBPTA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518LUtjqhRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Karate Kid Collection (Four Film Set)"}

There he meets five people from his past: the Blue Man (Jeff Richards), the Captain (Michael Imperioli), Marguerite (Dagmara Dominczyk), Ruby (Ellen Burstyn), and Tala (Nicaela and Shelbie Weigel). Each shows him how he impacted their life or they his--and not always for the better. (In these flashbacks, Callahan Brebner and Steven Grayhm play the young Eddie.) The point may seem simplistic--everyone is connected--butThe Five People You Meet in Heavenfinds a unique and engaging way to make it.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "The long-awaited emergence ofNightmare Alleyinto the light of DVD should achieve two things: make a legendary film noir available to a new generation, and restore the horrific charge to the lately watered-down termgeek, a concept that once had the power to give people very bad dreams indeed.To his lasting credit, Tyrone Power--20th Century Fox's extraordinarily handsome but not terribly interesting star of the '30s and '40s--begged for the chance to play Stan Carlisle, the predatory charmer who snakes his way through this bracingly unwholesome story. A spieler for--and lover of--carnival mind reader Zeena (Joan Blondell), he displays uncanny skill at \"reading\" the susceptible rubes, including a tough sheriff who turns to jelly after Stan psychs him out. Once Stan's mastered the intricate code used in Zeena's act, he's set to dump her for the younger, sexier Molly (Coleen Gray) and go bigtime as nightclub psychic \"Stanton the Great.\" After that, it's only a blasphemous bank shot to superstardom as a miracle worker with his own tabernacle and radio show.Few '40s films ventured as deeply into cynicism asNightmare Alley, or dealt so frankly with sexuality (with ripplings of polymorphous perversity yet) and power-tripping. The movie's rhythm is uncertain and Jules Furthman's screenplay telegraphs things, but the overall tone is remarkable, as are individual sequences: the freaky forced marriage of Stan and Molly in accordance with carny morality, and a creepy night scene in a park when Stanton the Great raises a ghost for a high-society client. Cinematographer Lee Garmes's chiaroscuro creates a relief map of the carnival world and what passes for life there. As for the geek... well, you'll find out whatgeekmeans. Stan does.--Richard T.

{"description": "From Hollywood's legendary Cocoanut Grove to the pioneering conquest of the wild blue yonder, Martin Scorsese'sThe Aviatorcelebrates old-school filmmaking at its finest. We say \"old school\" only because Scorsese's love of golden-age Hollywood is evident in his approach to his subject--Howard Hughes in his prime (played by Leonardo DiCaprio in his)--and especially in his technical mastery of the medium reflecting his love for classical filmmaking of the studio era. Even when he's using state-of-the-art digital trickery for the film's exciting flight scenes (including one of the most spectacular crashes ever filmed), Scorsese's meticulous attention to art direction and costume design suggests an impassioned pursuit of craftsmanship from a bygone era; every frame seems to glow with gilded detail. And while DiCaprio bears little physical resemblance to Hughes during the film's 20-year span (late 1920s to late '40s), he efficiently captures the eccentric millionaire's golden-boy essence, and his tragic descent into obsessive-compulsive seclusion. Bolstered by Cate Blanchett's uncannily accurate portrayal of Katharine Hepburn as Hughes' most beloved lover,The Aviatoris easily Scorsese's most accessible film, inviting mainstream popularity without compromising Scorsese's artistic reputation. As compelling crowd-pleasers go, it's a class act from start to finish.--Jeff ShannonDVD FeaturesIn his commentary track, director Martin Scorsese offers his own impressions of Howard Hughes and rattles off his memories of experiencing Hughes's films.  He mentions how he made Cate Blanchett watch every Katharine Hepburn film from the '30s on the big screen, and observes that Kate Beckinsale had \"a real sense of the stature of a Hollywood goddess.\"  But in general he doesn't talk much about the craft of making the film.  That area is covered better by editor Thelma Schoonmaker, who also appears on the commentary track, and producer Michael Mann makes a few appearances (all were recorded separately).  The picture is brilliant, but the 5.1 sound is not as aggressive in the rear speakers and subwoofer as one might expect, other than some nice surround effects in theHell's Angelsflying sequence.The second disc collects almost three hours of features.  There's one unnecessary deleted scene, and an 11-minute making-of featurette that's basically the cast and director heaping praise on each other.  More interesting are the short featurettes on visual effects (including the XF-11 scene, of course), production design, costumes, hair and makeup, and score, and Loudon Wainwright discusses his and his children's musical performances.  Historical perspective is provided by spotlights on Hughes's role in aviation and his obsessive-compulsive disorder, and a 43-minute Hughes documentary from the History Channel (part of the Modern Marvels series, it focuses on his mechanical innovations and spends less than a minute on his movies).  More unusual are DiCaprio and Scorsese's appearance on an OCD panel, and a half-hour interview segment DiCaprio did with Alan Alda.--David HoriuchiThe Personalities ofThe AviatorClick the links to explore more movies by these stars.Leonardo DiCaprioasHoward Hughes\"Sometimes I truly fear that I... am losing my mind.

{"description": "Creepy, tense, and enigmatic, Renny Harlin'sMindhuntersis a grisly cross between Agatha Christie's whodunit classicAnd Then There Were Noneand Jonathan Demme's horrifyingThe Silence of the Lambs. An interesting ensemble cast, including Christian Slater (Windtalkers), Jonny Lee Miller (Melinda and Melinda), L.L. Cool J (Harlin'sDeep Blue Sea), and Kathryn Morris (television'sCold Case) portray promising FBI profilers-in-training. Val Kilmer plays their ambiguous instructor putting the candidates through their paces and leaving them for a weekend on a spooky island, where those who survive a terrifying exercise--penetrating the mind of a serial killer via elaborate clues--will go to the head of the class. The rules change, however, when the students themselves turn out to be victims, bumped off one after another, the survivors half-mad with suspicion and paranoia that the murderer is one of their own. The film's concept is sound even if the execution (so to speak) gets out of hand with problems of logic. Among other things, none of these characters could possibly find time to pull off some of the psychopath's more complicated killing rituals. Quibbles aside, however,Mindhuntersis particularly watchable if one is in the mood for a movie that plays mind games.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008EY9G", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B002GHHHL0", "6305047456", "0783240295", "B00AEFYF2K", "B00022XE6S", "B003VA3JUO", "B004BR7XGM", "B00003CXSD", "B000C0Z93G", "B000R4SMCW", "B00IKM5LXG", "B00IKM5OCO", "B0000ALPFL", "B00005JKQS", "B000R348QW", "B00J11U54K", "B00JA3RVG4", "B00H1RMWYW", "6305505802", "B001ASIHZG", "B0007W7I4W", "6305922675", "B00AIBZMD6", "B009AMAJPA", "B00BEIYGT8", "B000056HPB", "6305090564", "B00005JMWP", "B000T28Q00", "B00009RDG9", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00003CXUP", "B0042FDCR2", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B00AEFXEGS", "B009HIKAN8", "B00005UQ9W", "B00JU949TK", "B0058ZPNBI", "B00151QYXU", "B00C7T0EPS", "B0006D3HGA", "B00DZH8H2S", "B00AEFYCW8", "6301971345", "B001CC7PLM", "B00005JD5M", "B00003W8NT", "B00BEIYIF0", "B001QOGYFO", "B002WSYLLM", "6304884400", "B000BUNZY2", "B0084NZEPG", "0790732149", "B00DZP1C2W", "B00003CXND", "B00003CXSP", "B002O3Z4WK", "B002NZK5RI", "B00BEJL6JK", "B00GICP7UW", "B00DWZHTOU", "B00AEFXPSK", "B003Y5H4SO", "B00022R9BE", "B003ASLJJU", "B000055Y0Y", "B00000IQVQ", "B0015OKWL2", "B00CX7EMM0", "B002AK9UPO", "B000MNOX8U", "B00AEBBA2W", "078322799X", "B001BP4K22", "B00HGB9NAY", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B002AT8KA6", "B000NQRR1Q", "B00005JKIP", "0790729334", "B00HOGBXS6", "B0018LX9SU", "B00005O5B5", "B00BLF9FOK", "B00AEBB9AA", "B007549W62", "B000BVM1S2", "B0000541TL", "B00HEPC0TS", "B00BTYOYG2", "B00275EHDM", "B00DMUFXOS", "B00003CXQG", "B000IJ79TS", "B008FCX2D2", "B00JL6L4WC"], "bought_together": ["B00008EY9G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0671528904", "B00022XE6S", "B00008EY9G"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 47503}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.99, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B0009YA3OA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YtxsGY2sL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mindhunters"}
{"description": "Whoever persuaded MGM to make a movie about giant, bloodthirsty bunnies must have been some kind of mad genius.Night of the Lepusfeatures Stuart Whitman (star of such classics asOmega CopandDemonoid, Messenger of Death) and Janet Leigh (whose career had taken a downturn fromPsycho) as a pair of scientists who say things like \"I wish I knew what the effects of this serum would be--let's hope it works\" as they inject test rabbits with hormones that turn them into slavering, carnivorous giant bunnies. That's the plot; the rest of the movie is scenes of giant bunnies attacking horses, giant bunnies jumping through windows to attack people, giant bunnies running in herds down the freeway...lots and lots of giant bunnies, sometimes with blood smeared across their ferocious jaws as they rear up to attack. The special effects are breathtakingly cheap; the bloody corpses are actors with red syrup splashed over them. But what makesNight of the Lepuseven more astonishing is that the dvd features dubbing in French, presumably for European viewers bored with their usual diet of Truffaut and Rohmer. In fact, the movie makes more sense in French (assuming you don't actually speak the language); you can pretend it was created by an inspired Surrealist, and that Janet Leigh says things like \"My bicycle has wheels of cheese\" or \"Beauty kisses my savage earlobe,\" instead of \"Rabbits aren't exactly Roy's bag.\" Also starring Rory Calhoun (Roller Blade Warriors: Taken by Force) and DeForest Kelley (Dr. McCoy on the originalStar Trek), who wears several colorful turtlenecks.

{"description": "Masterpiece indeed. With 14 films, each supplemented with numerous documentaries, commentaries, and other bonus materials,Alfred Hitchcock - The Masterpiece Collectionwill be the cornerstone for any serious DVD library. Packaged in a beautiful, conversation-starting velvet box, the individual discs inside come four to a case, decorated with original poster art.No doubt opinionated fans will argue about what should fall under the rubric of \"masterpiece\" in Hitchcock's body of work, but with the bona fide classicsVertigo,Psycho, andThe Man Who Knew Too Much, there's plenty of timeless movie magic here. Eye-popping transfers and gorgeous sound make this set one of the must-have releases of the year.Should the Hitchcock fan have the energy for more after imbibing on the movies themselves, a bonus disc provides additional documentaries. These include a revealing interview in which the master of suspense discusses, among other things, how much he dislikes working with method actors, going so far as to name names (we're talking about you, Jimmy Stewart and Montgomery Clift). In an American Film Institute lifetime achievement ceremony, the master of suspense is praised by the likes of Stewart and Ingrid Bergman, and seems to be suffering from severe boredom as celebrities pile on the flattery. Then Hitchcock opens his mouth to accept the award, delivering an endlessly witty stream of perfect bon mots that prove once again that he was a master of high comedy as well. Revealing documentaries about the making ofPsychoandThe Birdsround out the feast of extras. The 36-page booklet, filled mostly with stills and poster art, provides little new information about the films.--Ryan BoudinotFilms Included inAlfred Hitchcock - The Masterpiece CollectionSaboteurRobert Cummings stars as Barry Kane, a patriotic munitions worker who is falsely accused of sabotage, in this wartime thriller from Alfred Hitchcock. Plastered across the front page of every newspaper and hated by the nation, Kane's only hope of clearing his name is to find the real villain. The script as a whole is a clever one--Algonquin wit Dorothy Parker shares a screenwriting credit, and her trademark zingers make for a terrific mix of humor and suspense.Saboteuris a pleasure whether you're a die-hard Hitchcock fan or just someone who likes a good nail-biter.--Ali DavisShadow of a DoubtAlfred Hitchcock considered this 1943 thriller to be his personal favorite among his own films, and although it's not as popular as some of Hitchcock's later work, it's certainly worthy of the master's admiration. Scripted by playwright Thornton Wilder and inspired by the actual case of a 1920's serial killer known as \"The Merry Widow Murderer,\" the movie sets a tone of menace and fear by introducing a psychotic killer into the small-town comforts of Santa Rosa, California. Through narrow escapes and a climactic scene aboard a speeding train, this witty thriller strips away the fa&#xE7;ade of small-town tranquility to reveal evil where it's least expected. And, of course, it's all done in pure Hitchcockian style.--Jeff ShannonRopeAn experimental film masquerading as a standard Hollywood thriller,Ropeis simple and based on a successful stage play: two young men (John Dall and Farley Granger) commit murder, more or less as an intellectual exercise. They hide the body in their large apartment, then throw a dinner party. Will the body be discovered? Director Alfred Hitchcock, fascinated by the possibilities of the long-take style, decided to shoot this story as though it were happening in one long, uninterrupted shot. Since the camera can only hold one 10-minute reel at a time, Hitchcock had to be creative when it came time to change reels, disguising the switches as the camera passed behind someone's back or moved behind a lamp. James Stewart, as a suspicious professor, marks his first starring role for Hitchcock, a collaboration that would lead to the masterpiecesRear WindowandVertigo.--Robert HortonRear WindowLike the Greenwich Village courtyard view from its titular portal, Alfred Hitchcock's classicRear Windowis both confined and multileveled: both its story and visual perspective are dictated by its protagonist's imprisonment in his apartment, convalescing in a wheelchair, from which both he and the audience observe the lives of his neighbors. Cheerful voyeurism, as well as the behavior glimpsed among the various tenants, affords a droll comic atmosphere that gradually darkens when he sees clues to what may be a murder. At deeper levels,Rear Windowplumbs issues of moral responsibility and emotional honesty, while offering further proof (were any needed) of the director's brilliance as a visual storyteller.--Sam SutherlandThe Trouble with HarryA busman's holiday for Alfred Hitchcock, this 1955 black comedy concerns a pesky corpse that becomes a problem for a quiet, Vermont neighborhood. Shirley MacLaine makes her film debut as one of several characters who keep burying the body and finding it unburied again. Hitchcock clearly enjoys conjuring the autumnal look and feel of the story, and he establishes an important, first-time alliance with composer Bernard Herrmann, whose music proved vital to the director's next half-dozen or so films. But for now,The Trouble with Harryis a lark, the mischievous side of Hitchcock given free reign.--Tom KeoghThe Man Who Knew Too MuchAlfred Hitchcock's 1956 remake of his own 1934 spy thriller is an exciting event in its own right, with several justifiably famous sequences. James Stewart and Doris Day play American tourists who discover more than they wanted to know about an assassination plot. When their son is kidnapped to keep them quiet, they are caught between concern for him and the terrible secret they hold. When asked about the difference between this version of the story and the one he made 22 years earlier, Hitchcock always said the first was the work of a talented amateur while the second was the act of a seasoned professional. Indeed, several extraordinary moments in this update represent consummate filmmaking, particularly a relentlessly exciting Albert Hall scene, with a blaring symphony, an assassin's gun, and Doris Day's scream.The Man Who Knew Too Muchis the work of a master in his prime.--Tom KeoghVertigoAlthough it wasn't a box-office success when originally released in 1958,Vertigohas since taken its deserved place as Alfred Hitchcock's greatest, most spellbinding, most deeply personal achievement. James Stewart plays a retired police detective who is hired by an old friend to follow his wife (a superb Kim Novak, in what becomes a double role), whom he suspects of being possessed by the spirit of a dead madwoman. Shot around San Francisco (the Golden Gate Bridge and the Palace of the Legion of Honor are significant locations) and elsewhere in Northern California (the redwoods, Mission San Juan Batista) in rapturous Technicolor,Vertigois as lovely as it is haunting.--Jim EmersonPsychoFor all the slasher pictures that have ripped offPsycho(and particularly its classic set piece, the \"shower scene\"), nothing has ever matched the impact of the real thing. More than just a first-rate shocker full of thrills and suspense,Psychois also an engrossing character study in which director Alfred Hitchcock skillfully seduces you into identifying with the main characters--then pulls the rug (or the bathmat) out from under you. Anthony Perkins is unforgettable as Norman Bates, the mama's boy proprietor of the Bates Motel; and so is Janet Leigh as Marion Crane, who makes an impulsive decision and becomes a fugitive from the law, hiding out at Norman's roadside inn for one fateful night.--Jim EmersonThe BirdsVacationing in northern California, Alfred Hitchcock was struck by a story in a Santa Cruz newspaper: \"Seabird Invasion Hits Coastal Homes.\" From this peculiar incident, and his memory of a short story by Daphne du Maurier, the master of suspense created one of his strangest and most terrifying films.The Birdsfollows a chic blonde, Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren), as she travels to the coastal town of Bodega Bay to hook up with a rugged fellow (Rod Taylor) she's only just met. Before long the town is attacked by marauding birds, and Hitchcock's skill at staging action is brought to the fore. Beyond the superb effects, however,The Birdsis also one of Hitchcock's most psychologically complicated scenarios, a tense study of violence, loneliness, and complacency. What really gets under your skin are not the bird skirmishes but the anxiety and the eerie quiet between attacks. Treated with scant attention by serious critics in 1963,The Birdshas grown into a classic and--despite the sci-fi trappings--one of Hitchcock's most serious films.--Robert HortonMarnieSean Connery, fresh from the second Bond picture,From Russia with Love, is a Philadelphia playboy who begins to fall for Tippi Hedren's blonde ice goddess only when he realizes that she's a professional thief; she's come to work in his upper-crust insurance office in order to embezzle mass quantities. His patient program of investigation and surveillance has a creepy, voyeuristic quality that's pure Hitchcock, but all's lost when it emerges that the root of Marnie's problem is phobic sexual frigidity, induced by a childhood trauma. Luckily, Sean is up to the challenge. As it were. Not even D.H. Lawrence believed as fervently as Hitchcock in the curative properties of sexual release.--David ChuteTorn CurtainPaul Newman and Julie Andrews star in what must unfortunately be called one of Alfred Hitchcock's lesser efforts. Still, sub-par Hitchcock is better than a lot of what's out there, and this one is well worth a look. Newman plays cold war physicist Michael Armstrong, while Andrews plays his lovely assistant-and-fianc&#xE9;e, Sarah Sherman. Armstrong has been working on a missile defense system that will \"make nuclear defense obsolete,\" and naturally both sides are very interested. All Sarah cares about is the fact that Michael has been acting awfully fishy lately. The suspense ofTorn Curtainis by nature not as thrilling as that in the average Hitchcock film--much of it involves sitting still and wondering if the bad guys are getting closer. Still, Hitchcock manages to amuse himself: there is some beautifully clever camera work and an excruciating sequence that illustrates the frequent Hitchcock point that death is not a tidy business.--Ali DavisTopazAlfred Hitchcock hadn't made a spy thriller since the 1930s, so his 1969 adaptation of Leon Uris's bestseller seemed like a curious choice for the director. But Hitchcock makes Uris's story of the West's investigation into the Soviet Union's dealings with Cuba his own. Frederick Stafford plays a French intelligence agent who works with his American counterpart (John Forsythe) to break up a Soviet spy ring. The film is a bit flat dramatically and visually, and there are sequences that seem to occupy Hitchcock's attention more than others. A minor work all around, with at least two alternative endings shot by Hitchcock.--Tom KeoghFrenzyAlfred Hitchcock's penultimate film, written by Anthony Shaffer (who also wroteSleuth), this delightfully grisly little tale features an all-British cast minus star wattage, which may have accounted for its relatively slim showing in the States. Jon Finch plays a down-on-his-luck Londoner who is offered some help by an old pal (Barry Foster). In fact, Foster is a serial killer the police have been chasing--and he's framing Finch. Which leads to a classic Hitchcock situation: a guiltless man is forced to prove his innocence while eluding Scotland Yard at the same time. Spiked with Hitchcock's trademark dark humor,Frenzyalso features a very funny subplot about the Scotland Yard investigator (Alec McCowen) in charge of the case, who must endure meals by a wife (Vivien Merchant) who is taking a gourmet-cooking class.--Marshall FineFamily PlotAlfred Hitchcock's final film is understated comic fun that mixes suspense with deft humor, thanks to a solid cast. The plot centers on the kidnapping of an heir and a diamond theft by a pair of bad guys led by Karen Black and William Devane. The cops seem befuddled, but that doesn't stop a questionable psychic (Barbara Harris) and her not overly bright boyfriend (Bruce Dern, in a rare good-guy role) from picking up the trail and actually solving the crime. Did she do it with actual psychic powers? That's part of the fun of Harris's enjoyably ditsy performance.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0045HCJ9E", "B002GSXKQA", "B00AEBB97S", "B000UVV25Q", "B0002HOEPS", "B0002HOEQ2", "B000A9QK7I", "B00IOFMZYM", "B001D8W7EK", "B001D8W7F4", "B0002HOERG", "B00000CQJZ", "B002945DUM", "B001D8W7EU", "B000AARK30", "B000AL733G", "B000TXPXD2", "B005EVY8MQ", "B005UL4NF2", "B00000C0QO", "B000HDR814", "B007FQXEVY", "B002NPY7GS", "B00AQMGQVY", "B001D8W7EA", "B000KJU12S", "B001KXZGO6", "B006TTC5WC", "B001FBV4T4", "B003B3V0RA", "B004K4FUT8", "B006H37PXY", "0671604295", "0060988274", "B000K6GM4W", "B002GSXKPQ", "B00FEOYY8G", "B009RWRINE", "B00ARA4SLU", "0385418132", "B001FBNQYA", "B0017HMF6W", "B0006Z2NSG", "B0050FXDDQ", "B002ID098A", "B003USBF3K", "6305999872", "B0012Q3T5O", "B007FQXEQO", "B0002NRRRE", "B002945DU2", "B001EXE2Y2", "B004UOHNAC", "B00005JKGX", "B002945DWA", "B000MGBSDK", "B0087ZG7OI", "B0002HOEQW", "B00BOM98PG", "B005HK13S6", "B000FFJYAW", "B006TTC5J0", "B002VWNIAY", "B000BMY2LU", "B000BQ5IXW", "B00AD4KE8G", "B003UN2I4K", "B008D1R52Y", "B00004TWZH", "B00000JNUZ", "B0057T66UW", "B00004XPPK", "B000FTCLRQ", "B005F265CU", "B0002B15ZG", "B00AEBB89C", "B0006Z2NS6", "B002ID098U", "B0001HAGTW", "B000244F2S", "B000KIX8VK", "B005AMJ3B0", "B008FYZJ2C", "B001KXZGOG", "B0002HOEQM", "B001T21R50", "B000CEXEWA", "B000FI9OCW", "B008BFSMBA", "B00AATFJI4", "B00K6D1QV8", "B0077T5SWC"], "bought_together": ["B0045HCJ9E", "B00AEBB97S"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005EVY8MQ", "B002GSXKQA", "B000AL733G", "B0045HCJ9E"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 16199}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 81.5, "brand": "Masterpiece", "asin": "B000A1INJE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41PCBEW2ZSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Alfred Hitchcock - The Masterpiece Collection"}

{"description": "Lorna Doone was filmed three times before in the silent era, and six times more in the sound era, but the 1922 production directed by Maurice Tourneur is arguably one of the finest, and without a doubt the most beautiful. Like most of the feature adaptations of Lorna Doone, the 1922 version allows the romance and action of the novel to exist largely untouched by the tumult of the English Civil War. A young girl of noble birth is kidnapped by the Doones, a feared band of thieves and cutthroats. Their leader, fallen nobleman Sir Ensor Doone, raises the girl, Lorna, as one of his own kin. Lorna secretly falls in love with yeoman John Ridd, but must contend with the brutish Carver Doone, who wants Lorna for his own.  In Lorna Doone, Tourneur uses natural lighting and the landscape to frame his actors with painterly effect, showcasing a very different set of aesthetic values than those of The Blue Bird, with its elaborate stylized sets and costumes. Both are representative gems of his silent work, much of which remains lost.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00JRHW4GK", "1497372755", "B000H5U5IK", "B00J84NGBE", "B00006LPE4", "B000FS9FLC", "B00IGK6TGU", "B00D8HNRBG", "B0006Q93LA", "B00D9BNONW", "B000LY271A", "B000A59QJ6", "B008JEJSB6", "B0018W2L0G", "B004OOL73W", "B0017OLUV6", "B0013XZ6RK", "B0000E68WC", "B004YOED9M", "B000094J73", "B004TPJN0K", "B000FS9FLM", "B000094J75", "B00064AEWY", "B000EQHXJQ", "B000QRIKR2", "B001AD6UFA", "B008I3Q0B4", "B00014NF66", "B001GOEYAG", "B0007NMKSU", "B00005M2CH", "B000TUDHJ2", "B00005M1ZO", "B008ERNLFC", "B000067IYD", "B000094J79", "B000EQHXIW", "B003N0E5DW", "B00A33J8PM", "B008I3Q0FK", "B002BEXFNW", "B00007CVSA", "B00000JMOO", "B000FSME5Q", "B00BF36ZXC", "B00005ASOT", "B00004W19B", "0911572759", "B009NVZCV4", "B000056N7V", "B0046CLSGS", "B00014NF5W", "B007UQ8ISI", "B003YBNNMY", "B00005O5CD", "B0000E69GR", "B000V3IX82", "B0056HTEHW", "B0000633SZ", "B005C7FWZE", "B0016A2FGU", "B00004Z4VE", "B002MZZU6A", "B000EGDCGO", "B000EOTWBK", "B000BC8T0K", "B00004Z4TJ", "B000EUM4JQ", "B000FJTV7Y", "B00007L4MH", "B0066E6PA8", "B0024R1CF4", "B00008H2GZ", "B007XTDXX2", "B007XTDWS8", "B008PVQQ3G", "B00AYNG796", "B00ARKYSWE", "B00917IQ1I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005B1VM", "B0000AQS3P", "B004KK3IIC"]}, "price": 16.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 270311}, "asin": "B000A59QIW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516T5PEWE4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lorna Doone"}

{"description": "Third in a series of films based on the bestselling novels by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins,Left Behind: World at Warfinds the post-Rapture Earth an even bleaker place than in the previous movies. As the Antichrist himself, Nicolae Carpathia (Gordon Currie), uses his newfound powers as head of the world government to bring war and plague on every nation, the American president (Louis Gossett Jr.) teams with a Christian resistance fighter (Jessica Steen) to try to stop him. Meanwhile, series hero Buck Williams (Kirk Cameron) discovers that Carpathia's biological front in a coming apocalypse is particularly devious: Freshly published Bibles are carrying a deadly disease ravaging thousands--and may very likely claim Buck's new bride. Buck's father-in-law, pilot Rayford Steele (Brad Johnson), has problems of his own facing the not-inconsiderable temptations of former flight attendant Hattie Daniels (Chelsea Noble), now one of Carpathia's many lovers. Directed by Craig R. Baxley (Rose Red),Left Behind: World at Waris particularly crisp and effective drama, even when the action stops, as it often does, for many of the principals to pray for guidance. Charles Martin Smith (The Untouchables), not seen often enough these days, has a brief but powerful part as the U.S. vice-president.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006HMPC", "B000XY6RA0", "B000051S4T", "B00004YS9G", "B000051S4V", "B000059MPN", "B00005UF7J", "B0038N9X22", "B002H6NVOC", "B002UNXS68", "B00720OO0S", "B00006IUGH", "B000RZIH6W", "B00005Y6XK", "B00175GAHE", "B0002XNT1C", "B00D6I7HH2", "B00HYFNT34", "B002TVQ4C6", "B008B49F4Y", "B000FIHNA2", "B008ZRKIQ6", "B004RUEXVQ", "B00BBE962W", "B001KEHAFI", "1878859900", "B000BWPIPE", "B000056WRR", "B007VJ5D14", "B0085Z6ZHE", "B0062NAX1U", "B004KPD1IO", "B003UCA4XI", "B0069RWAL0", "B006JN87F2", "0842342524", "B0083TUE7E", "B001EAWMB0", "B00KDK64DY", "B005335K9A", "B00097E6NQ", "1414305761", "B003XDJEKS", "B00D6I7DEE", "B003X82CZM", "B007Q0JJIQ", "B000VECADK", "B000ARXG0Y", "B00AKIPAG6", "1936488264", "B008ZQ4WEQ", "B00ICWO144", "0842361901", "B000KLQUS0", "B003BJO8Q4", "B00004REOG", "B00005UF7K", "B001QB5SS6", "0842342532", "0967680689", "B0051T46R8", "B00GTO6XRK", "B008MZJ2GI", "B000GB5MEC", "B000WE817I", "141430580X", "B009XJVKKS", "1414305818", "B006MWA96K", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B00584A7MY", "0830744517", "1414334907", "B0006J28K0", "0842360611", "B000QUU7KC", "B00CNIDI5Q", "B002OPZ3AG", "0842360565", "B006G89C5O", "B008RYMZXG", "B0064J3PCQ", "B00005O5HF", "B001D7T6A4", "B002NALPEK", "B002Z2X7GU", "0882708791", "B000OAV03C", "B000EHPXP6", "B000PG29VC", "B00ICWO0ZY", "B003A6X166", "B007X4ECKU", "B00AMR5LZA", "B002QOHW36", "B00308BAXK", "B00ENP6I9U", "B00006IUFW", "B003AWRM9W", "B00005UW81"], "bought_together": ["B00006HMPC", "B000XY6RA0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00175GAHE", "B000XY6RA0", "B001KEHAFI", "B00006HMPC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 58631}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 16.99, "brand": "Sony Pictures", "asin": "B000ASDFHM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YZQBM2BNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Left Behind - World at War"}

{"description": "Angel - Season OneHe's hunky, he's brooding, he's a do-gooder, and he was Buffy's first boyfriend. Angel, the tortured vampire destined to walk the earth with a soul, got his own series after three seasons onBuffy the Vampire Slayerand did what any new star might do: he moved to L.A. (the City of Angels--get it?) and set up shop. Angel (co-created byBuffymastermind Joss Whedon) finds the titular vampire (David Boreanaz) as a kind of supernatural private investigator, fighting evil one case at a time and, like his ex-girlfriend, keeping the world from getting destroyed by vengeful demons and such. This first season features guest appearances by variousBuffycharacters, including werewolf boy Oz (Seth Green), rogue slayer Faith (Eliza Dushku), deliciously evil vamp Darla (Julie Benz), and Buffy herself (Sarah Michelle Gellar), all of whom helped get the show off and running in style.Angel - Season TwoThe second season ofAngel, saw the cult vampire show finally stand on its own fromBuffy the Vampire Slayer, assembling all the members of the show's core cast, transferring the action to a fashionably run-down L.A. hotel, and bringing in a few Buffy characters from Angel's history to further establish the moody vampire's own mythology. Moving their Angel Investigations to posher digs, Angel (David Boreanaz), Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter), and Wesley (Alexis Denisof) were soon joined by street fighter (J. August Richards)&#x96;-and by street fighter, of course we meandemonstreet fighter. But just as this group was solidifying, up popped Angel's old love, Darla (the fantastic Julie Benz), freshly arrived in L.A. from a hell dimension&#x85; just in time to be turned into a vampire again by her old cohort, Drusilla (Juliet Landau), and lure Angel into abandoning his newly formed team.Angel - Season ThreeIn the third season ofAngel, the titular vampire with a soul was forced to stand alone thanks to the (temporary) death of his beloved Buffy and her show's move to a new network, with no crossover between the two allowed. He returns from seeking peace in a demon-haunted monastery to find the L.A. Angel Investigations team fighting supernatural crime in his absence. Fred is still haunted by the nightmare dimension from which they rescued her; Cordelia's visions get ever more painful and debilitating. The schemes of the evil law firm Wolfram and Hart become every more imaginative and dragon lady Lilah Morgan becomes even more of an enemy when lusting after Angel. Unbelievably, Darla, Angel's vampire sire and lover, turns up, pregnant with his child and is tortured by inexplicable motherly feelings as well as a raging thirst for human blood.Angel - Season FourAs the fourth season ofAngel, starts, everything is still as we left it: Angel has been sunk to the bottom of the sea in an iron box by his inexplicable and vindictive son Connor and Cordelia has been summoned to higher realms to await orders. Gunn and Fred are left in the Hyperion Hotel, unsure about what has happened to their friends, and Lilah is working hard to seduce Wesley to the dark side. In the first few episodes, some of this is resolved but it's almost immediately replaced by far worse crises: prophesies of doom accumulate more rapidly even than usual in this wonderfully gloomy show and a horned rock-like beast rains fire on Los Angeles. This last year isAngel&#x92;s most tightly dramatic season yet--with a story arc of surprising intensity punctuated by the show's usual wit and sexiness.Angel - Season FiveLives were upended--and some co-opted--in the fifth and final season ofAngel, as the denizens of Angel Investigations found themselves taking on one of their scariest endeavors ever: corporate life. After making a literal deal with the devil (or something distinctly devil-like), Angel (David Boreanaz) moved his team from their crumbling hotel to the high-rise digs of law-firm-from-hell Wolfram & Hart, his reasoning being they could better fight the forces of evil from the inside, and with more resources to boot. Clever maneuvering or easy rationalization? Not a few members of Angel's team accused him of selling out (as did a number of viewers), but as with most of the show's previous four seasons,Angelsomehow took a dubious premise and mined it for gold. And with one core cast member gone (Charisma Carpenter, whose Cordelia was immersed in a deep coma), it seemed as if the show, from within and without, would suddenly fall apart--that is, until Angel's longtime nemesis Spike (James Marsters) showed up, fresh from his sacrificial roasting at the series finale ofBuffy the Vampire Slayer.

{"description": "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air's third season simultaneously provided some of the best and worst episodes of the show's six-year run. Set up as a classic collision of streets and society, the show soon found Will (Will Smith) beginning to adapt a little too well to his upper-crust home. He transfers to the same prep academy as Carlton (Alfonso Ribeiro), peruses Ivy League colleges, and truly starts to believe everything comes to him easily. Two spoiled characters (Carlton and Hilary, played by Karyn Parsons) are tolerable, but three begins to get grating. Five is even worse, if you count parents Philip and Vivian Banks (James Avery and Janet Hubert-Whitten), who jumped on the whining bandwagon just enough for their tired butler, Geoffrey (Joseph Marcell) to abruptly quit for one episode.While strong family core values remained the show's focus (Avery and Hubert-Whitten are good role models for parents who don&#x92;t try to be their children's buddy), Will became less of a good-natured jokester and more of a flagrant womanizer, going as far as to trick an abstinent girl (Kim Fields) into thinking they had married to get her into bed. Other less entertaining storylines included Philip's run for Superior Court judge against his sleazy mentor (Sherman Helmsley), and Will's possession of drugs, which Carlton accidentally consumes and nearly dies from (leading to the first of Smith's clumsy attempts at teary confrontations; in later seasons he would prove more successful at them). The show also wrote in Hubert-Whitten's pregnancy resulting in a new baby for the Banks, and gave Hilary a \"real\" job as a weather girl. Season three's highlights include the Banks family's appearance onOprah, and more instances of Carlton's famous dance to Tom Jones' \"It's Not Unusual\" -- with guest appearance by Jones as his guardian angel. And that, we can never get enough of.--Ellen A.

{"description": "On the surface, David Cronenberg may seem an unlikely candidate to directA History of Violence, but dig deeper and you'll see that he's the right man for the job. As an intellectual seeker of meaning and an avowed believer in Darwinian survival of the fittest, Cronenberg knows that the story of mild-mannered small-town diner proprietor Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) is in fact a multilayered examination of inbred human behavior, beginning when Tom's skillful killing of two would-be robbers draws unwanted attention to his idyllic family life in rural Indiana. He's got a loving wife (Maria Bello) and young daughter (Heidi Hayes) who are about to learn things about Tom they hadn't suspected, and a teenage son (Ashton Holmes) who has inherited his father's most prominent survival trait, manifesting itself in ways he never expected. By the time Tom has come into contact with a scarred villain (Ed Harris) and connections that lead him to a half-crazy kingpin (William Hurt, in a spectacular cameo), Cronenberg has plumbed the dark depths of human nature so skillfully thatA History of Violencestands well above the graphic novel that inspired it (indeed, Cronenberg was unaware of the source material behind Josh Olson's chilling adaptation). With hard-hitting violence that's as sudden as it is graphically authentic, this isA History of Violencethat's worthy of serious study and widespread acclaim.--Jeff ShannonOn the DVDOn a single disc and with little fanfare, this DVD makes an excellent case for the best extras of the year. Dive into the one-hour-long documentary and learn more about moviemaking than on many a double-disc. The secret lies in director David Cronenberg's (and his usual crew) folksy casualness in showing off the craft, be it makeup (green screens were used), directing (Cronenberg doesn't storyboard), or art direction (the diner set). It also is very funny to hear about \"fish Fridays\" and how Maria Bello's Uncle Pete became an influence. Even the infamous sex-on-the-staircase scene is diagnosed with candor as stars Viggo Mortensen and Bello act as if there is no backstage camera. There's only one deleted scene, but it's uncommonly deconstructed on why it was filmed and why it was cut (it's a very Cronenbergian dream sequence). A short bit on Cannes is also a delight. So much is here that Cronenberg's smart commentary track is nearly superfluous. Isn't that a nice surprise?--Doug ThomasMore to ExploreThe Graphic NovelOther Graphic Novels that Inspired MoviesDavid Cronenberg EssentialsWhy We Love Maria BelloThe work of Viggo MortensenThe work of William HurtStills fromA History of ViolenceViggo Mortensoe as Tom StallAshton Holmes as Jack Stall and Kyle Schmid as Bobby JordanWilliam Hurt as Richie CusackEd Harris as Carl Fogarty and Viggo Mortensen as Tom StallMaria Bello as Edie StallDirector David Cronenberg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000YENUI6", "B001LRJH0U", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B008R65XP6", "B004SIP8ZM", "B001FB5634", "B0001EFV7C", "B00004W18Z", "B001EIOOWC", "6301971345", "B000M341QE", "B00000K31T", "B000GFLKF8", "B000P0J0D8", "0767802519", "B004SUDQ72", "B003ASLJQS", "B002PJYPYG", "6304698747", "B000F5WR4W", "B003Y5H4R0", "B0018O4YT0", "B00AEBB9CS", "B0028OH568", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00000JDIQ", "B000FUTVLY", "B002AT8KAG", "B000XR9L50", "6305313687", "0783228457", "B002QEHPQU", "B001FB55L2", "B000Y7WGOW", "B002VWNIEA", "B00022XE6S", "B006PTL1QM", "B000P0J0AG", "B004499LX0", "B00005JMOW", "B002T9H2LA", "B001TOD92C", "B005OK721G", "B000FKO5QK", "B0019EXZY4", "B002ZG99N6", "B0007DFJ0G", "B003LR5BD0", "B003RHZ6F2", "B00AEFY5B6", "B000N6TX1I", "0792833279", "B005LAIIJY", "B000FVQM2Y", "B000FC2FX8", "B001BNFRB2", "B00005JN0W", "B002XMGGK6", "B00007E8UI", "B0064NTZQ2", "B00D3DJIG8", "B0010DR4BO", "B0013XZ6X4", "B00AEFXE9U", "B007D5E7C2", "B000ALM40I", "B00001ZWUS", "B00005V9HH", "B00008RH3L", "0783229402", "B000QXDCLK", "B000P0J0EW", "B000BBOUUE", "B000A7DVR2", "B000K7VHQ4", "B00000F4MA", "B000XA5K48", "B00004XPPB", "B0002IQMAM", "B00029LNYQ", "B00003CXWV", "B004XQO90O", "B000GIW9I2", "B004U7MR14", "B002DKGWSE", "B0064MT1FI", "B0000TANUI", "B009T3AE1Y", "B0000VLKVM", "B00006LPGP", "B00005JLRE", "B000F7CMRM", "B00AEFXESQ", "B001DZOC64", "1558908315", "B0036TGTDE", "B000NOKFHQ", "B008220DGE", "B00007AJE1", "B000BVM1S2"], "bought_together": ["B000YENUI6", "B001LRJH0U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000YENUI6", "B008MILL78", "B009T3AE1Y", "B000M341QE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 45602}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.36, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B000CQLZ0Q", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51g0dghsrYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A History of Violence (New Line Platinum Series) [DVD]"}

{"description": "An entire missing segment of Buster Keaton's career is filled in with the release of this collection, which comprises the 10 shorts Keaton made at Columbia Pictures in 1939-41. If you're a Keaton fan (and why on earth wouldn't you be?) this section of the great man's work has always been in dispute--and above all, hard to see. After his career collapsed at the beginning of the 1930s, Buster Keaton struggled to find a niche in Hollywood, and the Columbia contract was essentially his last sustained opportunity to headline in films on a regular basis. It was a difficult fit from the start:  Keaton did not have the artistic control he enjoyed over his 1920s classics, and director Jules White (who helmed most of the Columbia shorts) had a radically different view of comedy from his star. White guided the hijinks of Columbia's busiest comedy stars, the Three Stooges, and his leadpipe-to-the-noggin style did not mesh well with Keaton's measured, logical approach.If one dials down expectations, some of the Columbia shorts (around 16-17 minutes long) are enjoyable in the baggy-pants style of the Three Stooges. And when it comes to searching for signs of the old Keaton, there are usually one or two blossoms poking out of the overall bluntness.Mooching through Georgia, a Civil War spoof, has moments of silent hilarity and a Keatonesque note of fatalism as Buster is marched to his own execution.Nothing but Pleasurehas a terrific sequence involving a drunk woman who wanders into Buster's motel room, and Buster's efforts to get her into a Murphy bed.She's Oil Minefeatures a breathtaking gag in which Keaton is spun around like a tire iron in order to get a pipe unstuck from his finger. Keaton, in his mid-40s, is still in athletic form, although thanks to alcohol and disappointment he looks older than his years.Commentaries adorn the shorts, and there's a useful 25-minute documentary giving the general outline of Keaton's life and details on the Columbia arrangement. It's refreshingly honest about the mixed quality of these films, and contains excerpts from his silent shorts that suggest how far the genius had slipped. In that sense, while this DVD package honorably presents a moment from film history (and with fine technical specs all around), the actual watching of these shorts is tinged with sadness. The casual moviegoer curious about Keaton should go elsewhere; the completist will want it; the amateur historian will want to give a look to see what the \"missing years\" were all about.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000A7DVMM", "B003H221M8", "B00049QQ78", "B004XEEMA8", "B00LT1JHLW", "0306801787", "B00652FG38", "B007AAEZ7W", "B00097DXG2", "B00006IUIU", "B0002HOEJY", "B00652FG60", "B006P5KEOQ", "B009CSVQB8", "B00652FG4M", "B001FD6MJO", "B005DKS1W6", "B00FNRA7VW", "B0041CGOZ8", "B00005QW5A", "B002A2B348", "B00GBT61YS", "1578069637", "B000B5XORA", "B002TCRQNG", "B00AIA89ZA", "B00KALQI1O", "B005BYBZKY", "B00AOCDE7U", "B000E1MXTQ", "B00DO8HXHI", "B008BWFOXC", "B004XEEMAI", "B003YBNNMY", "B0002CHIEC", "B00007L4MK", "B0016A2FHE", "B003H221MI", "0810942275", "B003ZYU3T6", "1494285592", "B007N5YJMU", "B00JGR3M26", "B004OOL73W", "B00IJE1BOI", "B001E18222", "B00IF0KAYS", "B00316DDZO", "B00A1AU6VM", "B0062KMDWU", "6305701245", "0312496958", "B00DRQETNI", "B00895CC90", "B00FJYXQCG", "B00IF0KASY", "B0082CDGSG", "B000AM4PJK", "B000E6ESF8", "B003H221MS", "B00AQ6J5I6", "B00HFWETIK", "B005J7K9CI", "B00GFZLE04", "B00009Q4VX", "B000WC8CLU", "B006WN5W5M", "B004NWPXZS", "B005SDB8H8", "B0002CHIEM", "B001EXE2Y2", "B000G6BLHE", "B007UQ8ITM", "B00HE010LC", "B00AOCDE7K", "B0040QYROK", "B00H8KC1N4", "B000I8OM94", "B00CA4S024", "B0056HTEKO", "B00H4KQMX8", "B000HWZ4FC", "0806513039", "B0002CHIFG", "B00AQMGQVY", "B00143XDYM", "B0014VPFHW", "B001M9ELJY", "B004K4FUT8", "B00005ALM4", "B00005ALM3", "B00EO2I6RO", "B000AOEMUA", "076365079X", "B0006IUE98", "B00005QAQ0", "B000E6ESX0", "0810876825", "B002VWNIAE"], "bought_together": ["B000A7DVMM", "B003H221M8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004XEEMA8", "B001E18222", "B001FD6MJO", "B008BWFOXC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 146947}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.23, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000E1EHQI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41DCRB9SHSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Buster Keaton - 65th Anniversary Collection (General Nuisance / His Ex Marks the Spot / Mooching Through Georgia / Nothing but Pleasure / Pardon My Berth Marks / Pest From the West / So You Won't Squawk / The Spook Speaks / The Taming of the Snood / She's Oil Mine)"}
{"description": "The latest entry in theHarry Pottersaga could be retitledFast Times at Hogwarts, where finding a date to the winter ball is nearly as terrifying as worrying about Lord Voldemort's return. Thus, the young wizards' entry into puberty (and discovery of the opposite sex) opens up a rich mining field to balance out the dark content in the fourth movie (and the stories are only going to get darker). Mike Newell (Four Weddings and a Funeral) handily takes the directing reins and eases his young cast through awkward growth spurts into true young actors. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe, more sure of himself) has his first girl crush on fellow student Cho Chang (Katie Leung), and has his first big fight with best bud Ron (Rupert Grint). Meanwhile, Ron's underlying romantic tension with Hermione (Emma Watson) comes to a head over the winter ball, and when she makes one of those girl-into-woman Cinderella entrances, the boys' reactions indicate they've all crossed a threshold.But don't worry, there's plenty of wizardry and action inGoblet of Fire. When the deadly Triwizard Tournament is hosted by Hogwarts, Harry finds his name mysteriously submitted (and chosen) to compete against wizards from two neighboring academies, as well as another Hogwarts student. The competition scenes are magnificently shot, with much-improved CGI effects (particularly the underwater challenge). And the climactic confrontation with Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes, in a brilliant bit of casting) is the most thrilling yet.Goblet, the first installment to get a PG-13 rating, contains some violence as well as disturbing images for kids and some barely shrouded references at sexual awakening (Harry's bath scene in particular). The 2 1/2-hour film, lean considering it came from a 734-page book, trims out subplots about house-elves (they're not missed) and gives little screen time to the standard crew of the otherPotterfilms, but adds in more of Britain's finest actors to the cast, such as Brendan Gleeson as Mad-Eye Moody and Miranda Richardson as Rita Skeeter. Michael Gambon, in his second round as Professor Dumbledore, still hasn't brought audiences around to his interpretation of the role he took over after Richard Harris died, but it's a small smudge in an otherwise spotless adaptation.--Ellen A.

{"description": "Director Stuart Gordon picked an H.P. Lovecraft story for his installment of Showtime'sMasters of Horrorseries. So what did you expect? This filmmaker gained his horror-movie spurs with his wild and wonderful Lovecraft flicksRe-AnimatorandFrom Beyond(following up years later with another H.P. tale, the fishyDagon), so nothing could be more super-natural. For his hour-long episode, Gordon choseDreams in the Witch House, which follows a student (Ezra Godden) at Miskatonic University (that's Lovecraft's frequently-mentioned fictional school) as he moves into a suspiciously cheap boarding house. When he has intense nightmares about a rat with a human face, it should be a warning sign, but the student is mightily attracted to a single mom at the house, played by the mighty attractive Chelah Horsdal. Some acceptable mood-setting comes courtesy of Godden's elderly downstairs neighbor, and the half-dozen shocks are just fine. Somehow the straight-line story disappoints, as the ultimate outcome of it all seems fairly obvious from the opening scenes, and there's nothing much to complicate the slide into evil. Still, this episode merits a passing grade by the strict standards of Miskatonic U.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000067J0M", "B003V6XDP4", "B000PWQP9I", "B0085X315U", "B000FS2W3A", "B000E5KUME", "B000KJTFBG", "B000GI3RHY", "B000FS2W3K", "B000ERVKLW", "B000LPS47K", "B00KCTG4PO", "B006LMRMMA", "B000RL21PO", "8598310042", "B000GB5M2O", "B000RIWAV2", "157347049X", "B000F3UACK", "B0000DC12T", "B00005K3OC", "B00AJXO4FA", "B000RPCK2O", "B008CYDD7I", "B00009YXHN", "B000UR9QXK", "B008CYDDWI", "B000A6T1ZO", "B00009PY4D", "B002FLOTPO", "B000RL21OK", "B00B8O4WQA", "B00153HMF2", "B000WC38FU", "B000FA57WG", "B000FA57W6", "161696121X", "B000S1MMCK", "B00480PTWM", "B00DBNLAZW", "B000S1MMCU", "B00DOZNGTK", "B000UDGOAC", "B000GB5M2Y", "B00HHYGGBE", "B000UYX4P4", "B00K0MM4AM", "1934501050", "B000S0GYRU", "B000BQTC98", "B000F3UACU", "B00FM4S68W", "B000KJTFB6", "B000OYCMO4", "0142437956", "B00GSTHBTK", "B00005RHGK", "B006QWC2ZC", "B004X63SCY", "B001CW7ZWG", "B000GIXCM4", "B001MEJY8W", "B00D7AM5XU", "B000F0UUKK", "078062856X", "B000OUNXGO", "B00C7C00R2", "B005J9ZFQG", "B00BMUL6J6", "B00003CXLS", "B0000542CO", "B00977HRSK", "B0043VUHV4", "B00008974O", "B000795JMS", "B007Y1NNAW", "B00000K3TO", "B004EI2NPO", "B000NY0YJA", "B009EUVXZI", "1616617667", "B000WC3864", "B000RPCJ9I", "B00HT2RTU6", "B005JJCMOO", "B000MV8ZCW", "B000FFJZO2", "B0015U0QNK", "B0088FS1DC", "B00003CXCF", "B002LMSWN2", "0062082841", "B003ZEQMH8", "B00G7RON2Q", "B0015U0QO4", "B001EN5I4U", "B0009RQRT2", "B000VLLYGC", "B00CJF9T6A", "B0000A4GGF"], "bought_together": ["B000067J0M", "B003V6XDP4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003V6XDP4", "B000067J0M", "8598310042", "B000RL21N6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 47257}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 4.58, "brand": "STARZ/SPHE", "asin": "B000E5KUMO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5195J21DRVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Masters of Horror - Stuart Gordon - Dreams in the Witch House"}

{"description": "The tagline is \"Live music. Pure and simple.\" A mainstay on PBS since 1976,Austin City Limitsshowcases the finest in modern music. This two-CD set captures highlights from the fest's fourth year, opening with a rocker from Australia's Jet (\"Cold Heart Bitch\") and ending with a raver from Widespread Panic (\"Love Tractor\"). Twenty-four acts strut their stuff on the first disc, including a bonus selection from the John Butler Trio (\"Treat Yo Mama\"), and each is represented by one song. Some performances take place in the sunshine (it was 108 degrees on Sunday), some after dark. The heat means bare-chested bass players (the Bravery), drummers (Bloc Party), and vocalists (Thievery Corporation), and more than enough sweat to go around&#x97;most of it stuck to Britain&#x92;s Kaiser Chiefs (\"I Predict a Riot\"). The second disc consists of extras, including 14 short interviews and four mini-documentaries. Although it's fair to say there's something for everyone here, the emphasis is on alternative rock and there are few female-fronted combos, with the exception of Texas quartet Eisley (\"Golly Sandra\") and Illinois singer/songwriter Rachael Yamagata (\"Be Be Your Love\"), who also duets with Jason Mraz (\"Did You Get My Message?\"). Standouts include Washington DC's Thievery Corporation with the dubbed-out \"Warning Shots\" and Ohio duo the Black Keys with the smoking \"Set You Free.\" Some of the notable 2005 participantsnotfeatured on this collection include Lucinda Williams, Lyle Lovett, the Black Crowes, Wilco, and Spoon&#x97;let's hear it for a sequel!--Kathleen C.

He gives his impressions of what animals think, from his own animals (a monkey, a Doberman) to police dogs, and it seems so exact, so precise.

While the firstIce Agetook a delightful premise and suffocated it with a formulaic plot--in which a mammoth named Manfred (voiced by Ray Romano,Everyone Loves Raymond), a sloth named Sid (John Leguizamo,Moulin Rouge!), and a sabre-tooth tiger named Diego (Denis Leary,Rescue Me) helped an abandoned human infant return to its tribe (basically,Three Mammals and a Baby)--the sequel takes the now-familiar setting, gives it a shapeless, episodic storyline, and yet somehow becomes pretty darn entertaining. Faced with the threat of a flood from melting ice, our heroic trio are on the run to escape from their blossoming valley. On the way, they meet a female mammoth (Queen Latifah,Bringing Down the House) who thinks she's an opossum and get menaced by some freshly defrosted carnivo!  rous fish.

{"description": "John Wayne's road to stardom needed some giddyup in the early 1930s; after a leading-man turn inThe Big Trail, he quickly fell into B-movie obscurity. While waiting to vault to first-tier status in 1939'sStagecoach, he honed his talent with a set of six B-Westerns at Warner Brothers, shot in 1932-33. The series allowed Warners to recycle footage (and plots) from a string of silent Westerns made with Ken Maynard, with the young Mr. Wayne stepping into Maynard's saddle. These snappy little films (under an hour each) are contained on two Warners DVDs; this one has the first three pictures in the series.Ride Him, Cowboyis the best of the batch, a very entertaining number in which Wayne is introduced to a feisty horse named, of all things, Duke. Duke would feature in the later films, as would Wayne's harmonica playing. The movie has some wild stunt riding and some very amusing dialogue (someone urges a pokey storyteller, \"Skip that part and get down to bedrock\"). And for a cheap B-movie, there's some exceptionally inventive camerawork by Ted McCord, who would go on to shootThe Treasure of the Sierra MadreandEast of Eden.McCord also shotThe Big Stampede, which doesn't have much drama but lives up to its title with a cattle-frenzy finale. Noah Beery Sr., plays the baddie, and Wayne's futureStagecoachco-star Berton Churchill plays Lew Wallace (the governor of New Mexico and the man who wroteBen-Hur).Haunted Goldadds a dose of haunted-house shenanigans to an awkward tale about a hidden cache of gold. The comic relief comes from character actor Blue Washington, who unfortunately has the kind of wide-eyed, scaredy-cat role that too many black actors of the era got stuck with.Wayne, 25 years old, plays the same naively heroic hero in each. He's lean and handsome and not yet grown into his talent. But you can see how much the camera likes him--as his future director Howard Hawks might have put it--and how much that famous stride is already coming into step.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000HT38D0", "B000EQHXMI", "B000O599LW", "B000O599MG", "B00B1CGE1A", "0783230400", "B000O179JK", "B000BPL2FG", "B00BM4Q4KS", "B00C3ALLPS", "B000O599X0", "B000O599W6", "B000O599XA", "B000O599M6", "B0001FVDX2", "B00BN2JWOY", "B00A196OCI", "B000O599NU", "B00C3ALKYK", "B008I34YC6", "B00083FZG8", "B000O599VM", "B00A196N8I", "B008I34XW2", "B000O599YY", "B003TTZT8W", "B00B1CGFVE", "B00AOO5QTM", "B000O599US", "B00B1CGCSA", "B008I34ZHA", "B008I34Y6M", "B0001US6CS", "B0009ML2JC", "B00BFWKE62", "B00BGQ2P9G", "B00CFHEE08", "B000N4SHX0", "B000BPL2HO", "B00006L92Y", "B000NNUWZC", "B000HXDEWQ", "B000O59A0C", "B0009ML2KQ", "B003P485AK", "B00005N89K", "B00BNH9NNE", "B0082LUFA4", "B0014BJ1A4", "B00BGARG50", "B000O599Y4", "B00AMQGFYM", "B000U1ZV6M", "B000O599NA", "B00E4DJK78", "B000ANVPP6", "B0047BXR94", "B001BSBBRQ", "B00005S8KR", "B00007JZXL", "B00008CMR6", "B0015TJBXW", "B000F0UUIC", "B001PO55LE", "0783230478", "B00AEFXSVE", "B00KIZYDCI", "B000O599YE", "B00KIZY3XW", "B00BGQ2QXQ", "6304696612", "B009A881OA", "B003MJRPWC", "B00KTZALDC", "B000O599ZI", "B00A196JSC", "B000O599NK", "B00008CMR4", "B00AEFYBA6", "B00AEFXUL2", "0782011276", "B000059TFU", "B0006MYV02", "B000O599XU", "B00K8CQ1Q2", "B000O599YO", "B0018O4RT2", "B000O599WQ", "0783228031", "B00BCMSYDU", "B00195I3OK", "B00IYRLUEG", "B00393SG0G", "B003YCL136", "B000FTCLQW", "B00004ZBVE", "B00AMDA2OY", "B00008MTW7", "B00HRUQ8VG"], "bought_together": ["B000HT38D0", "B000O599MG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000HT38D0", "B000EQHXMI", "B000O599XA", "B000BPL2FG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 52541}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.88, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000HT38C6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GcSalMmlL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Big Stampede / Ride Him, Cowboy / Haunted Gold"}

{"description": "If Richard Donner's 1978 feature filmSuperman: The Moviemade us believe a man could fly, Bryan Singer's 2006 follow-up,Superman Returns, lets us remember that a superhero movie can make our spirits soar. Superman (played by newcomer Brandon Routh) comes back to Earth after a futile five-year search for his destroyed home planet of Krypton. As alter ego Clark Kent, he's eager to return to his job at the Daily Planet and to see Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth). Lois, however, has moved on: she now has a fianc&#xE9; (James Marsden), a son (Tristan Leabu), and a Pulitzer Prize for her article entitled \"Why the World Doesn't Need Superman.\" On top of this emotional curveball, his old archrival Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) is plotting the biggest land grab in history.Singer, who made a strong impression among comic-book fans for his work on the X-Men franchise and directed Spacey inThe Usual Suspects, brings both a fresh eye and a sense of respect to the world's oldest superhero. He borrows John Williams's great theme music and Marlon Brando's voice as Jor-El, and the story (penned by Singer'sX-Mencollaborators Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris) is a sort-of-sequel to the first two films in the franchise (choosing to ignore that the third and fourth movies ever happened). The humorous and romantic elements give the movie a heart, Singer's art-deco Metropolis is often breathtaking, and the special effects are elegant and spectacular, particularly an early airplane-disaster set-piece. Of the cast, Routh is excellent as the dual Superman/Clark, Spacey is both droll and vicious as Luthor, and Parker Posey gets the best lines as Luthor's moll Kitty. But at 23, Bosworth seems too young for the five-years-past-grizzled Lois. It's nice to see Noel Neill, Jack Larson (both from the classicAdventures of SupermanTV series), and Eva Marie-Saint on the screen as well. Superman Returns is one of those projects that was in development for seemingly forever, but it was worth the wait -- it's the most enjoyable superhero movie sinceSpider-Man 2andThe Incredibles.--David HoriuchiMore SupermanWatch our exclusive interviews with the cast ofSuperman ReturnsOther feature filmsSuperman in high definitionSmallvilleAdventures of SupermanSee all Superman DVDs", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001DJLD2G", "B000IJ79VQ", "B000IJ79X4", "B000IJ79XE", "B000IJ79WU", "B008JFUPFI", "B000IJ79UW", "B001CDR1FG", "B000ION23U", "B002GSXKN8", "B004EPZ07K", "B0000959N0", "B00005JNTU", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001DHXT20", "B000VI70QS", "B0006L0LOS", "B0007P0Y7C", "B000UR9T8C", "B00005JNJV", "B00005JMQW", "B00005JKCH", "B000AYELVU", "B004LWZW42", "B0090SI56Y", "B001OST0LW", "B001OST0M6", "B001QB9H1U", "B000HCO83Q", "B000PE0G0A", "B001GCUO1Q", "B0002IQMAM", "B004LWZWGA", "B008JFUS0U", "B000P0J06K", "B000OVLBF8", "B00E5I2MCM", "B003YAR97K", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00080ZG2O", "B003QO8TOQ", "B001FB55HQ", "B005LAIGW8", "B000I8OM94", "B000FO0AHY", "B00IZZDWKM", "B000P0J06U", "B0007V6ITE", "B008JFUO72", "B000AYELVA", "B002NXSRVG", "B00DYEN6XC", "B00E5I2MEK", "B000BT96EG", "B001HQZJMU", "B001QTXM5Y", "B00E5I2M6I", "B002HWRYJE", "B00E5I2M9K", "B001614E68", "B000059Z8L", "B001VLBDD0", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B000EU1Q2M", "B000KJU1KK", "B00BTYMPUY", "B000H30B2C", "B001F7MSFM", "B0013BM63O", "B00F4FFO8E", "B000EGDB10", "B00008G8M5", "B00JPS7HOA", "0790738953", "B000B7QCGS", "B000HWZ4E8", "B00BBXSPES", "B000FMGTTE", "B0083SBMBM", "B003Z8ZCDO", "B005LAII44", "B000P6XQ50", "B000VI28Z6", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001RHGRT8", "B000F4RH8E", "B002ZG99B8", "B001AK3S4Y", "B00005JL78", "B0002ZMHX6", "B0007G89FU", "B006VRRGNK", "B00BBAQD6S", "B009JBWOU0", "B000BT96FA", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00BGI086Q", "B003UN2ICM", "B0000VCZMK"], "bought_together": ["B008JFUPFI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008JFUPFI", "B00F4FFO8E", "B001DJLD2G", "B000IJ79UW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 57565}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.73, "brand": "DC Comics", "asin": "B000J10EQU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ddmxk8VML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Superman Returns (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Pile together a blue-ribbon cast, a screenplay high in quirkiness, and the Sundance stamp of approval, and youve got yourself a crossover indie hit. That formula worked for Little Miss Sunshine, a frequently hilarious study of family dysfunction. Meet the Hoovers, an Albuquerque clan riddled with depression, hostility, and the tattered remnants of the American Dream; despite their flakiness, they manage to pile into a VW van for a weekend trek to L.A. in order to get moppet daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) into the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. Much of the pleasure of this journey comes from watching some skillful comic actors doing their thing: Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette as the parents (hes hoping to become a self-help authority), Alan Arkin as a grandfather all too willing to give uproariously inappropriate advice to a sullen teenage grandson (Paul Dano), and a subdued Steve Carell as a jilted gay professor on the verge of suicide. The film is a crowd-pleaser, and if anything is a little too eager to bend itself in the direction of quirk-loving Sundance audiences; it can feel forced. But the breezy momentum and the ingenious actors help push the material over any bumps in the road. -- Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000YABYLA", "B00005JMJG", "B001UV4XGU", "B00A81MV3U", "B00DL46ZN8", "B00005JNC2", "B0007TKOAA", "B001UV4XUG", "B00005ALS0", "B00118T632", "B00AEFXESQ", "B007L6VR12", "B008220BA2", "B003L20ICE", "B0000640VJ", "B008OHV49W", "B001P9KR8U", "B000A7DVR2", "B00000F5MN", "B007L6VRBM", "B00AFEY354", "B0001GOH6Q", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00337KM2S", "B000H0MKOC", "B004UXUX4Q", "B0034G4OZE", "B00011CZRE", "B00275EGWY", "0205751989", "B000FVQLQQ", "B0010X8NF0", "B004SIP95G", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B004QL7KKC", "B00079Z9VO", "B00003CXZ4", "B0021L8UOY", "B001MM3AZM", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00606P0BM", "B00005Q4CS", "B00ADRYCWC", "B001TOD92C", "B004SEUIW4", "B000P0J0EW", "B0015OKWKI", "B000CS464G", "B0007PLLBU", "B00009W5CA", "B00005JLSB", "B004A8ZWV0", "B007RKFXUS", "B0010AN7Z4", "B00012QLB4", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B003UESJH4", "B00005JNBQ", "B007VYE4PK", "B000WZEZGI", "B00AEBB9F0", "6304907729", "B003Y5H574", "B000SFOW8I", "B00005JMJ4", "B001BL96K2", "B00006FMUW", "B002VPTJOA", "B00003CXO1", "B000J103OI", "B0038N9WKU", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00008975Z", "B003ASLJQI", "B0049985XW", "B003ASLJO0", "B001J9KJ4I", "B001FZQOW2", "B00000G02H", "1557047707", "B000BYRCQU", "B00121QGPY", "B00005JL57", "B000021Y77", "B000A3XY5A", "B000MZHW40", "B0000AC8LR", "B00AEFY0KW", "B0045HCJ9E", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B00AEBB9FA", "B00005A06N", "B000ELJAEM", "B00AEFYAMA", "B00E8RKHWW", "B00005JLRE", "B005LAIHE0", "B000M341QE", "B0039UT3LK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00118T632", "B00DL46ZN8", "B0007UC8Y4", "B001AGXEAG"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 401537}, "asin": "B000JU9OJ4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51T7A7BDBWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Little Miss Sunshine [Region 2]"}
{"description": "A Sundance Film Festival Grand Jury Prize-winner,Quincea&#xF1;erais a small film with a big heart. The plot unfolds at the leisurely pace of life itself, yet there's not a wasted moment in the script. The story follows the travails of young Magdalena (Emily Rios), a teen in the Mexican-American, but gentrifying, Los Angeles neighborhood of Echo Park. As Magdalena's 15th birthday approaches, and the festive coming-of-agequincea&#xF1;eraparty that accompanies it, life throws her a curve ball in the form of an unexpected--and possibly miraculous--pregnancy. In disgrace, she turns to her elderly uncle Tomas and sometime gangbanger and not-quite-uncloseted gay cousin Carlos. The interactions of these unlikely family members ring completely true, with stellar performances by Dios as well as Chalo Gonz&#xE1;lez as her warm Tio Tomas and Jesse Garcia as the smoldering Carlos. The portrayal of life in Echo Park is intimate and effortless, as the teens slide interchangeably between Spanish and English; crime and gang activities coexist with trendy gay couples and their fashionable remodels. And in the heart of it all, the family ties among the three lead characters prove unconventional--and unbreakable. The DVD also contains a commentary with the filmmakers and cast members, a Q&A; with them, and a \"making-of\" featurette.--A.T.

{"description": "\"It don't make sense, the chica chica boom chic. But it's immense, the chica chica boom chic.\" Let us pause to ponder the immortal wisdom of these words, sung by Carmen Miranda inThat Night in Rio, and then move swiftly on to effortless enjoyment of this splashy nonsense. Here we are in Rio--well, the Fox backlot--for an absurd tale of mistaken identity and romantic trading-off. Nightclub performer Don Ameche looks exactly like a famous South American airline magnate (also played by Ameche, natch), and so doubles for him during a lavish party when the Baron is away on delicate business. Alice Faye, still the top female star at Fox at this time, takes a supporting role, slightly miscast, as the Baroness. Faye always had the down-on-the-farm appeal expressed in her all-American face, but the form-fitting gold gown she wears during the party gives evidence of another kind of appeal; she's drop-dead sexy here.The songs by Mack Gordon and Harry Warren are not copious, but Carmen Miranda has a couple of signature numbers and Faye sings \"They Met in Rio.\" The plot had been adapted once before, asFolies Bergere, and would later surface asOn the Riviera, with Danny Kaye. Extras include an informative 14-minute documentary about Alice Faye's life after quitting movies in 1945 (her two daughters contribute) and a deleted scene that has Faye and Ameche doing--you guessed it--\"The Chica Chica Boom Chic.\"--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BZISUI", "B000EXDSA2", "B00158K14G", "B00158K1AA", "B000EXDSAC", "B00K8CQ1Q2", "B0019APR62", "B000K7VHNC", "B0002B15RE", "B000EXDS7A", "B0019APR6W", "B00158K1B4", "B00KGLS050", "B0019APR6M", "B00199PPUG", "B0019APR5S", "B000GETTIO", "B0062Z0PLQ", "B000PC8AL4", "B000BZISU8", "B00GXKZQIM", "B00DZFKN54", "B00KIZY3XW", "B00BGGIXZQ", "B00JX3SHIC", "B0001FR55C", "B0001DCYUK", "B00IELX388", "B0006H32DY", "B00007GZQF", "B0018RKEQ4", "B00DVPMYWI", "B0012GVMIK", "B000AP04LK", "B00K6D1S7A", "B000EBD9S0", "B00C2U6IQQ", "B00GJT1ZPU", "B00023P4OC", "B0011FDVD6", "B00158K1AK", "B004G9C7RK", "B000E6ESWG", "B005F265FW", "B0024FAG1M", "B00012FXJ0", "B0041T50J2", "B000059GEI", "B00JK322I6", "B0019APR6C", "B004132I6Q", "B00143XDYC", "B0001NBMEE", "B001O2UTRW", "B002EWD0DG", "B000EXDS9S", "B000HA4WRU", "B00JXVNVRG", "B00K6D1R0I", "B0002B15Y2", "B005F265IE", "B0009NZ2NS", "B00008AOWK", "B00J7YV09K", "B0047BXR1C", "B00BGGIUZY", "B00KIZYDCI", "B005ETAN7C", "B00I9BU49Y", "B00004VVMZ", "B0007939MK", "B000UZDO3A", "B000FFJ83A", "B0012GVMIA", "B000CNE0M4", "B000E6ESXK", "B00EKGXA84", "B003Q9VXTY", "B00ICWO1LC", "B000RXVND8", "B000PAAK5A", "B000KGGJ18", "B00BY8DNM4", "B000EBD9SK", "B001CC7PLW", "B00APQGP1W", "B00B27WTBI", "B0062Z0PDO", "B0001LJCRA", "B00000ILEU", "B00I9BU60Q", "B008D1Q1VU", "B00143XE28", "B003XXCC8E", "B0062Z0PIO", "B001LMAK6A", "B008Y1YJLI", "B00DZP1BVO", "B00GOC752E", "B000EXDSBG"], "bought_together": ["B000EXDSA2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BZISUI", "B000EXDS7A", "B000K7VHMS", "B00158K14G"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 135772}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.99, "brand": "FAYE,ALICE", "asin": "B000K7VHNM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Jxe9mc%2B4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "That Night in Rio (Fox Marquee Musicals)"}
