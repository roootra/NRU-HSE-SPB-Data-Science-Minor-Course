{"description": "This is the restored, 209-minute director's cut of Wolfgang Petersen's harrowing and claustrophobic U-boat thriller, which was theatrically rereleased in 1997. Originally made as a five-hour miniseries, this version devotes more time to getting to know the crew before they and their stoic captain (J&uuml;rgen Prochnow) get aboard their U-boat and find themselves stranded at the bottom of the sea.Das Bootputs you inside that submerged vessel and explores the physical and emotional tensions of the situation with a vivid, terrifying realism that few movies can match. As Petersen tightens the screws and the submerged ship blows bolts, the pressure builds to such unbearable levels that you may be tempted to escape for a nice walk on solid land in the great outdoors--only you wouldn't dream of looking away from the screen.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CXHJ", "B0009RCPUC", "B009XTF8NI", "B0001NBMH6", "B00008K76U", "B00AEFYENK", "0304352314", "B00IJZW3QW", "B0001FGC1U", "B000021Y77", "0792841670", "6304765258", "B00005YUO1", "B00004XPPC", "B000274THQ", "B000EHSVS2", "B000EHSVSC", "B00005N5S3", "B00005JPKE", "B000E5N6KW", "B000NO1XJA", "B000OVLBGC", "0792839730", "B004VGHF7K", "B0007TKNGA", "B0000AMRUP", "B000O78L0U", "B0001NBMGC", "B00096S4B2", "B000H1RFQ4", "B00ID8H8EW", "B0001HLVS2", "B00005PJ8T", "B005HP2IYE", "B000MGTQ7K", "B00001ZWUS", "B00008AOTR", "B0009XRZI8", "B00079ZACC", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B00005AVZU", "B003ELKNH2", "B005HQBO9I", "B00005PJ8S", "B00005QCVP", "B005DTZXL4", "B00005JN9P", "B00AEFXVCU", "B0001WTWWE", "0790742047", "B00008PC0Y", "B00KHWSB5M", "B004ZJZQFG", "B0015D20FE", "B001TUZG4K", "B002KECJZ8", "079284646X", "B000MGTQ7U", "B00006ADD5", "B0000A02TY", "B0009A40EI", "B004R6EF9U", "B00008AOTO", "B000E5N63Y", "B00AEFYBA6", "B000M4RG42", "B000H5V8H2", "B00AEBBA36", "B00IVLR9JA", "B00009MEC4", "B00BTYNXL4", "B002QP145C", "B00BTYJYR6", "0792841409", "B004GJYRI2", "0792838408", "B000YKT4BW", "B002ID09BM", "B0051HCVEU", "B0037A4ILC", "B000TGCR38", "B00008AOTN", "B00005JKF6", "B000O599Z8", "B00008PC13", "B00B0U2SFE", "B003AWRMCO", "B000H1RFSM", "B0006B2A42", "B0012QE4PI", "B0006GANN2", "B006TTC5HC", "B0002XVS7Y", "B000I6BJ56", "B004QSQMPE", "B00005U8EN", "B008XJM7T2", "B000FZETR0"], "bought_together": ["B0001NBMH6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00IJZW3QW", "B00003CXHJ", "B009XTF8NI", "B0009RCPUC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 11970}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 16.47, "brand": "Columbia/Tristar Studios", "asin": "0767802470", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PPEJHCV3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Das Boot - The Director's Cut"}

{"description": "This thoroughly unpleasant thriller from the hands of Joel Schumacher (Batman and Robin) offers very little in its lurid tour of snuff films and the seedy pornographic underworld. A wooden Nicolas Cage stars as a private detective hired by a tycoon's widow, who discovers in her dead husband's safe some 8mm footage of a young girl being sexually abused and slaughtered. Cage's job is to determine the veracity of the film and to find out the girl's identity, whether she be alive or dead. What could have been a taut, nerve-jangling thriller is instead a lumbering, overwrought but underwritten tale of vigilante justice. Screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker also penned the imaginative and compellingSeven, but you wouldn't know it from this tired and monotonous script. Schumacher tries for echoes of bothThe Silence of the Lambsand Paul Schrader'sHardcore(which stars George C. Scott as a father trying to find his daughter in the seedy porn industry), but despite some slick camerawork, the film fails to draw the audience into either the mystery of the missing girl or Cage's supposed internal conflicts. It's not so much the unsavory subject matter as it is the sloppy and unimaginative filmmaking that makes the movie unbearable. Of the entire cast only Joaquin Phoenix, as a charismatic goth boy who works at an adult book store, comes away with a memorable performance.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003JRAB", "0783223218", "6303486746", "630470786X", "6302479487", "6304826133", "6301966899"], "also_viewed": ["B00012F6A6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 474128}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "", "asin": "076781956X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5136N2XDYBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "8mm [VHS]"}
{"description": "Lou Diamond Phillips leaves a haunting impression as the late 1950s pop idol Ritchie Valens, who made the Latino influence in rock &amp; roll conspicuous through his hit songs. Filmmaker Luis Valdez (Zoot Suit) creates a nimble, exciting, and sympathetic portrait of the boy driven to rise above obstacles of race and family legacy, and Esai Morales is equally fine as Ritchie's envious, searching brother. Great support from Elizabeth Pe&ntilde;a and Danielle von Zerneck as Valens's sister and mother, respectively, and Joe Pantoliano is solid as the singer's straight-talking manager. Valdez brightens up the third act with a rock &amp; roll show featuring, among others, Brian Setzer as Eddie Cochrane. Marshall Crenshaw turns up as Buddy Holly getting on that plane with Valens, and Los Lobos (who actually performs Valens's music on the soundtrack) has a nifty cameo as a Tijuana band that gives Valens a piece of crucial inspiration.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000P0J0CY", "B0001CNQX0", "B00000K3TX", "B00004RJ71", "B0002DRDIW", "B0000714BS", "B0000714BQ", "B000002LC8", "B003NF97NK", "0783114907", "B00180IPM6", "B00007J5VO", "B005HFI7IU", "B003E1QDAI", "B00004ZESY", "B000K2UGZM", "B000AM4P90", "B00AEBB9IM", "B0009R1TJ0", "B00005N89M", "B002WJHBCC", "B00AEFY5TI", "B000KJU15U", "B000063JDI", "B00465I1CE", "B000RHRGSK", "B002XUBDRY", "B00AEBB9ZK", "B003VA3JZY", "B00EE8AIW4", "6305428409", "B000GJ0LLI", "B0042837D8", "B0009IOR6Q", "B00AEFXZJE", "B0000DIXDR", "B004AOECXI", "B000K2Q7CI", "B0009HLC9W", "B00004Y2R1", "B00CAYH200", "6305428271", "B000065V3H", "B001GD6VTE", "B00441GYZG", "B001AEF6BS", "B0042EJDGM", "B000B74GCA", "0767821769", "B001D0T4JY", "0767812387", "B000P0J0C4", "B00009AOBI", "0800141806", "B000E8QVWY", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00005V9IA", "B0002VGTBQ", "0783228686", "B00006FDCD", "6305428050", "B00006RCOC", "B000N3T0HI", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00E1HIX66", "6305744793", "B00009AOAX", "B00008L3U1", "B00AMSS3TA", "B000E8QVBU", "B00005JND5", "B000ERVK3A", "B00081U7HC", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00AEFY5B6", "B0002VEZ3U", "B000FOPPC4", "B008IG0F4Y", "B001DJLD12", "B00003CXPS", "B000068TPB", "B00069FL7C", "B004IKZQPW", "B00158K0R4", "B000H5TH20", "B00AEFXPG2", "B00AEBBADG", "B001BGS16W", "B00003CXTG", "B0002TT0MI", "B0087F7VSY", "B0000AQS5F", "076780421X", "0767812182", "B002BIULKS", "6305213305", "B00004TJKK", "B00027JZ3E", "B00075VX2C", "B00006RZ9Y"], "bought_together": ["B000P0J0CY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004RJ71", "B000P0J0CY", "B000A50460", "B0001CNQX0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8913}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "Philips", "asin": "0767821637", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R7P26XWQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "La Bamba"}

{"description": "Computer scientist Hannon Fuller (Armin Mueller-Stahl) finds something extremely important. Knowing that he's marked for assassination, he leaves a message in the virtual reality world he's designed, hoping it will be found by colleague Douglas Hall (Craig Bierko). Hall is a suspect in Fuller's murder and indeed finds a bloody shirt in his house, with no recollection of what he did the night before. Hall plunges headlong into Fuller's world (a re-creation of 1937 Los Angeles) to try to unravel the slaying and is soon knee-deep in confusion and trouble. What this film lacks in character depth and plot cohesiveness it makes up for in special effects and high concept. Fans of films like Blade Runner, Dark City, eXistenZ, and even the game Sim City should find this appealing. Of course, there's the question of letting the computers do all the heavy lifting in films while the humans walk through the plot (an all-too-familiar scenario in 1999), but the re-creation of '30s Los Angeles is certainly something to see, pallid script and acting or not.

{"description": "A gripping contemporary thriller about the terrible truths that can hide behind everyday appearances, ARLINGTON ROAD is an intense, edge-of-your-seat journey that reveals just how little we know about the world around us.

With each twist, the mystery deepens and the question looms: is Faraday just consumed by fear and driven by paranoia, or has a lethal conspiracy been born on ARLINGTON ROAD?", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792835727", "B0043X1FNQ", "B00AEFXKZ8", "B00IKM5OCO", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00005V9HH", "B00002E23C", "B000OT6V0K", "B0043X1FM2", "0792844874", "B002GHHHN8", "B003ASLJIQ", "B00IKM5MIA", "B000A2UBN4", "B003ASLJQS", "B0002IQLHQ", "B003TRMLQM", "155890834X", "0790730979", "0790742047", "B00008L3S6", "B002O3Z4WK", "B00AEFXESQ", "B0045HCJ8K", "B00IJS2OHM", "B0007Y08QA", "B002AT8KAG", "0783240295", "B00BLN4UDS", "B002NZK5RI", "6305428115", "B000HC2LHG", "B00HEPC0TS", "B00FGVS0D2", "B00005JLKN", "B002NZK5R8", "B001R3YRG2", "B002NZK5VO", "B004SIP6WW", "B00DI0135K", "6305161933", "B000069HZP", "B00AEFYF2K", "B001KRVLCI", "B00AEBB9UK", "B000CEV3M8", "B00005JKQS", "B00000IQC2", "B00007AJE1", "B0010KP360", "0767802519", "B00AEBB9NM", "B008FYZHP6", "B0045HCJFS", "B0006HBZXS", "B00AEBB8SS", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00015YVDG", "B00HGJAPYO", "B0034G4P30", "0783222149", "B000P0J0AG", "B00003CXP7", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B00DZP1C2W", "B00I45844W", "B000067IZ3", "B0000YTOL2", "B0006IIKQW", "B0015OKWL2", "B005FUTBWS", "B00011CZRE", "B002GIBVVG", "B00GKOJ98E", "B0071HPP3M", "B000BBOUW2", "B000P0J0EW", "B000059TFO", "B004SIP7VM", "B000GFLKF8", "B00J5LXT44", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B005OJCI0C", "0792159659", "B000OYAT3U", "B004HO6HWA", "B00008K76W", "0767805712", "B00G7QPXUI", "0792846443", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B00003CXO1", "B002GHHHL0", "B00003CY0V", "B0000648X0", "B000P0J09C", "B004B3PBFQ", "B00008RH3L"], "bought_together": ["0792835727"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001D7T6CM", "B00BUAEYVK", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00005PJ6O"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 57340}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 17.99, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "0767836286", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51hgat4x3-L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Arlington Road"}
{"description": "What if you could stop your heart to simulate a temporary death, and then be revived so you could describe your near-death experience to others? The mysteries of life--and the afterlife--compel five medical students (Julia Roberts, Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, William Baldwin, Oliver Platt) to experiment with their own mortality, and what they discover has unsettling psychological implications. That's the intriguing premise of this neo-Gothic horror thriller, directed by Joel Schumacher (Batman & Robin) with his typical indulgence of vibrant colours and hyperactive, hallucinogenic style. The movie borders on silliness at times, and the near-death recollection of memories results in some repetitious scenes, but the dynamic young cast takes it all quite seriously, which is what keeps this gaudy thriller on the edge. The fascinating premise could have been made into a better film, but Schumacher's mainstream excess doesn't stop Flatliners from being slick, occasionally even provocative entertainment. --Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303909884"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 725731}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0767831322", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517S5SV68ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Flatliners [VHS]"}

{"description": "Situated somewhere between supernatural horror and lush Victorian melodrama, director Peter Weir's lyrical, enigmatic masterpiece is an imaginative tease. The setting is a proper turn-of-the century Australian boarding school for girls, a suffocating institution built on strict moral codes, repressed sexuality, and a subtle but enforced class structure. As the film opens, girls draped in immaculate white dress prepare for a picnic at the nearby volcanic formation, Hanging Rock, and Weir hangs an air of dark foreboding over the proceeding. \"You'll have to love someone else, because I won't be here very long,\" says one virginal girl, Miranda, to her friend. Her words are prophetic: during the picnic, Miranda, along with two other girls and an uptight schoolmistress, vanish into the rocks. While a search party repeatedly returns to the rock to look for either the girls or the reasons for their disappearance, Weir leaves the mystery unsolved. Like Antonioni'sL'Avventura, the vanishing is open to numerous interpretations--both rational and illusory--but Weir drops enough allegorical clues that it feels like a parable. He transforms the landscape and weather into menacing and eerie images; outlines of faces can be seen in the rocks, while the oppressive heat beating down on the picnic doubles as an atmospheric metaphor for the girls' unbearable social and sexual confinement. These images and other plot twists toward the end hint that this mysterious vanishing, on some level, was actually a form of spiritual escape--the only out, other than death, from the film's bleak, tightly structured community. Regardless of how you see it, though, this hypnotic puzzle remains the highlight of the '70s Australian New Wave. The DVD version presents the film in letterbox form.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005QAPI", "B00393SG42", "0143126784", "B00BTYJYR6", "B0008GGN9I", "B0009X75EC", "B00005JLD4", "B00005NFZC", "B00IBKXSKA", "B00005BHW6", "1559409002", "0899665608", "B00005V6N6", "B00007CVS3", "B00JRHW4GK", "B0002V7O0Q", "0780022076", "B000093NR0", "B001EAWMP6", "B00005JLMU", "B00J2PQZBC", "0780022343", "B004M66YUS", "B00005UQ7Q", "B00005UQ7R", "B0007M222A", "B001WLMOL4", "0780021320", "B003ICZW8M", "B004NWPY3E", "B00065GX64", "B00ICWO1LC", "B005HK13S6", "B000AQKUG8", "B0045HCJJE", "B00IGK6TH4", "B003ICZW7I", "B0001GH5TW", "B000UJ48SQ", "B0000BWVL4", "B00DZP1C9K", "B000G8NXYG", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B0002JP2OS", "B00005BCK0", "B000067IY4", "B0026VBOJW", "B000NOK0HG", "B000BB14I0", "0780022629", "B00DZP1BUU", "B000A7Q2KA", "B0007GAG42", "B00J2PQYYK", "B00005M2C7", "B0026VBOJC", "B0007M2234", "B00005JKGX", "B00HE00ZIQ", "B00393SG3S", "B0047P5FU4", "B00HE011DE", "B0006J27XS", "B001E18222", "B00007L4I6", "B001BEK8EM", "B0001UZZS6", "B0002V7S34", "B00004W3HF", "B00005NFZD", "B0006HC0FU", "B000AQKUH2", "B00000IOKV", "6305362688", "B00AEBB89C", "B000CNE08S", "B00005JH9B"], "bought_together": ["B00005QAPI", "B00393SG42"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0017WVSS8", "0143126784", "B00393SG42", "B00005QAPI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 67932}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.99, "brand": "WEIR,PETER", "asin": "0780021134", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P2Y9H89JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Picnic at Hanging Rock (The Criterion Collection)"}

{"description": "Previously filmed in 1933 (asIsland of Lost Souls) and 1977, the classic H.G. Wells story was filmed again for this graphic 1996 version. The film was roasted by critics, but it's an utterly fascinating failure, largely due to the performances of David Thewlis, Val Kilmer, and especially Marlon Brando in the title role as a mad (and in this case outrageously bizarre) scientist whose experiments in crossbreeding humans with animals have gone terribly awry. Thewlis plays the wayward scholar who is rescued at sea by Kilmer and brought to Moreau's island to discover the doctor's unnatural &quot;children.&quot; Fairuza Balk plays Moreau's half-cat daughter, but it's Brando and Kilmer (in one scene doing a killer Brando impersonation) who steal the show, along with the astounding makeup effects created by Stan Winston. A guilty pleasure by any measure, this movie has definite cult-favorite potential, and in addition to offering a &quot;director's cut&quot; with previously unseen footage, the DVD includes audio commentary by director John Frankenheimer, who replaced the original director on short notice and completed this film under highly stressful conditions.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005K3OB", "B005D0RDKM", "B00005JKLZ", "B00AEFY4IA", "155890848X", "B00003CXIV", "B00GSXE0B8", "B00004ZBVM", "B00HW3EJ6Y", "0486290271", "B003EYVXSW", "B00014X8DG", "B0045HCJ0S", "B00000IBL0", "B00079HZQ6", "B003VRV9DG", "B00IKM5LXG", "B002U4UZSQ", "B008NA3I1W", "B000A2UBN4", "B00CERJI5U", "B000063JDE", "B00IE41A9O", "B000OVLBHG", "B0000AOX0F", "B00004ZBVF", "B003WTO5NO", "B00009PY4I", "B000KHI2FS", "B00AEFXW8I", "0800177029", "B0045HCJSU", "B003L2M584", "B00AEFYXQI", "B00070FX5U", "B004AC6PMG", "6305127646", "B001I04QCO", "B00004W4UB", "B00005O439", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B00022XE6S", "B006WQHP4A", "B00005R2IS", "1619492334", "B004P7CMZ0", "B00004TJJV", "B001ECDVKE", "B00005B6L0", "B0045HCJKS", "B00HEPDGKA", "6305313687", "B002WY64IY", "B0002B15WY", "B0050MB5KM", "630469654X", "B0002IQLH6", "B000BRBA9C", "B00005O06X", "079073639X", "B0024FADD8", "B0051CSIKQ", "B0007RTBA6", "B000HC2LFI", "B000JLQQ94", "B005OT810I", "B000WC389G", "B0018O4YT0", "B0009X76XC", "B000TSIJWY", "B000QFCDGS", "B000U1ZV6W", "B00003CXKM", "B000067J0M", "B000NQRR1Q", "B00008G6E8", "B001DZOC6Y", "B004GSVXA8", "B000068MBS", "B000GBEWRU", "B0045HCJ9O", "B0007R4T1W", "B00J11U54K", "B00003CXCF", "B0006LB5AC", "B00005O5AX", "B0000VCZNE", "B00005RDAI", "B000XT1P4S", "6304712499", "B000E6ESEO", "B001DB6J50", "B002EP8FDI", "B000PFUAP0", "B00000JPH6", "B000A2IPQY", "B000B6CO3Y", "B004P7CN7W", "B000IJ7A5Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005K3OB", "B000HT38E4", "0486290271", "B00HEPDGKA"]}, "price": 15.52, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 16728}, "asin": "0780619951", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QSKY0A5ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Island of Dr. Moreau (Unrated Director's Cut)"}
{"description": "If you don't thinkAustin Powersis one of the funniest movies of the 1990s, maybe you should be packed into a cryogenic time chamber and sent back to the decade whence you came.  Perhaps it was the 1960s--the shagadelic decade when London hipster Austin Powers scored with gorgeous chicks as a fashion photographer by day, crime-fighting international man of mystery by night. Yeah, baby, yeah! But when Powers's arch nemesis, Dr.&nbsp;Evil, puts himself into a deep-freeze and travels via time machine to the late 1990s, Powers must follow him and foil Evil's nefarious scheme of global domination. Mike Myers plays dual roles as Powers and Dr.&nbsp;Evil, with Elizabeth Hurley as his present-day sidekick and karate-kicking paramour. A hilarious spoof of '60s spy movies, this colorful comedy actually gets funnier with successive viewings, making it a perfect home video for gloomy days and randy nights.

{"description": "Sight unseen, it's tempting to dismissPoison Ivyas a teen variation on your standard trashy erotic thriller, a genre born with such promise inBody Heatthat has since been in steady devolution. But whileIvyis noHeat, it's better than virtually any of those movies that star someone named Shannon. Crisp directing is supported by a script that takes a smart look at dysfunctional family dynamics, but most of all, it's the performances. Much has been made of Drew Barrymore's perfect casting as the title character, but she also does a sneaky and subtle job of straddling the fence: is Ivy a desperate, lonely young woman, an evil barracuda, or both? Tom Skerritt matches her step for step, playing the fallen husband as both hopelessly vain boob and genuinely lost soul. Cheryl Ladd delivers a sharp, minimalist performance as his Beverly Hills trophy wife dying of emphysema--becoming the still-life center of everyone else's life. And Sara Gilbert does a fine job in a role that gives her all the heavy lifting, playing tortured straight man to this pathetic and compelling tree full of coconuts. This DVD features both R-rated and unrated versions. The latter shows a bit more skin, although it's still fairly tame compared to the average skin flick. It also leaves Ivy a bit more ambiguous, and is thus a bit more fun.--Geof Miller", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000HT38EO", "B00004RF85", "B001LMU1NC", "B00E8G5HXM", "B00005IAQ7", "B0001GF2D8", "B00000JGOI", "B00006SFJJ", "B000PMFS2I", "078322933X", "B000099T3S", "B00001YXH8", "B0001US7UY", "B0045HCJGW", "6305433917", "0767817710", "B00005QW5T", "B00008HCC9", "B0000542C7", "B00005BCP5", "B0002KPIQY", "B00005JMIJ", "B0045O2PHS", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B00002RAO2", "B0000C3I96", "B003CPPY6K", "6305268827", "B00013RC7K", "B00008DP4C", "B0020LH8WU", "B00AEFXBPM", "B000EQ5SRK", "B0045HCIYA", "B004SUDQC2", "B000059TG7", "6305213305", "B00005JH9M", "B00366F2NU", "B000BX0VT6", "B000E5N684", "B005ZVIPG0", "B0010V60YI", "0767802616", "B00441GYVK", "B00049QQHI", "B005Z9MGRG", "B00DW5IKYS", "B000BBOUUE", "B00827OWO8", "B000MMMTBY", "B0037QGS0A", "B0002IQLHQ", "B001CRC4DG", "B00003CWQR", "B00ET2ODTE", "B000GI3KGC", "B000EZ9084", "B004SIP9MY", "0780618548", "B00005V4XV", "B000HC2LJE", "B00FB349R6", "0792842960", "B00005JKJS", "B00005JKJA", "B000QUEQ4K", "B00EMAGKNU", "B00000JGHK", "B0010X8NNM", "B00005U14H", "B00AEBB9LO", "157362618X", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00AEFXESQ", "0792839684", "B00005JPXA", "630529335X", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B00001PE4D", "B00023P4M4", "6305127654", "B00441GYVA", "B000053VB2", "B002Q3MZXE", "6305505802", "B0000ALPFL", "B0053TWVSC", "B0009R1TI6", "B00EVU3T26", "B00DMUFXOS", "B00004W4UD", "B005OK0YVG", "076780760X", "B00008972P", "B00003CWN3", "B000P0J0CY", "B000063JDE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000HT38EO", "B001LMU1NC", "B00004RF85", "0780627806"]}, "price": 13.48, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 53939}, "asin": "0780627776", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/413AVPXKBZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Poison Ivy (Unrated &amp; R-Rated Versions)"}

{"description": "Something's wrong in the town of Santa Mira, California. At first, Dr. Miles Bennell (Kevin McCarthy) is unconcerned when the townsfolk accuse their loved ones of acting like emotionless imposters. But soon the evidence is overwhelming--Santa Mira has been invaded by alien &quot;pods&quot; that are capable of replicating humans and taking possession of their identities. It's up to McCarthy to spread the word of warning, battling the alien invasion at the risk of his own life. Considered one of the best science fiction films of the 1950s and '60s, this classic paranoid thriller was widely interpreted as a criticism of the McCarthy era (that's Senator Joseph, not actor Kevin), which was characterized by anticommunist witch-hunts and fear of the dreaded blacklist. Some hailed it as an attack on the oppressive power of government as Big Brother. However viewers interpret it, this original 1956 version ofInvaders of the Body Snatchers(based on Jack Finney's serialized novelThe Body Snatchers) remains a milestone movie in its genre, directed by Don Siegel with an inventive intensity that continues to pack an entertaining wallop.

{"description": "Now you can achieve multiple viewings of the bestSexon TV.  Winner of Golden Globes for Best TV Series and Best Actress,Sex and the Cityis based on Candace Bushnell's provocativebestselling book. Sarah Jessica  Parker stars as Carrie Bradshaw, a self-described \"sexual anthropologist,\" who writes \"Sex and the City,\" a newspaper column that chronicles the state of sexual affairs of Manhattanites in this \"age of un-innocence.\" Her \"posse,\" including nice girl Charlotte (Kristin Davis), hard-edged Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), and party girl  Samantha (Kim Cattrall)--not to mention her own tumultuous love life--gives Carrie plenty of column fodder. Over the course of the first season's 12&nbsp;episodes, the most prominent dramatic arc concerns Carrie, who goes from turning the tables on \"toxic bachelors\" by having \"sex like a man\" to wanting to join the ranks of \"the monogamists\" with the elusive Mr.&nbsp;Big (Chris Noth). Meanwhile, Miranda, Cynthia, and Samantha have their own dating woes, few of which can be described on a family Web site.Seinfeldhas nothing onSex and the Citywhen it comes to shallow, self-absorbed characters or coining catch phrases. Episode&nbsp;2, for example, introduces the term \"modelizer\": a guy who is obsessed with and will only date models. Some may accuse this series of male bashing. But women, after years of enduring shows with \"men behaving badly,\" will relish the equal time. Some may blanch at the ladies' graphic language and ribald humor, or dismiss some of the situations as unrealistic (Carrie doesn't bat an eye when she discovers that an artist friend surreptitiously videotapes his sexual conquests). Still others will viewSex and the Cityas documentary.

{"description": "Steven Spielberg's first feature film, 1971'sDuel, is set on a desert highway. It stars Dennis Weaver as a driver being pursued by a menacing truck, which is following him with all the vengeance of the ancient furies. In this spiritual update from 1984, C.&nbsp;Thomas Howell plays a guy taking a drive-away car from Chicago to San Diego. On a whim, in the rain, and against his better judgment, he picks up a hitchhiker (Rutger Hauer). The hitcher quickly admits to being a murdering psychopath, and once Howell finally gets him out of his car, he is pursued with all the vengeance of the ancient furies. We're never sure if the hitcher is a figment of his imagination, making Howell a schizophrenic killer, or if he's real and Howell is the random victim of a wandering madman, which is how his potential new girlfriend (Jennifer Jason Leigh) thinks of him.

Incarcerated, he uses another inmate's prison break as a cover for his own escape. Waiting for him, according to plan, is his partner, Buddy (Ving Rhames). Also waiting for him, not according to plan, is federal agent Karen Sisco (the ravishing Jennifer Lopez).

{"description": "Arnold Schwarzenegger as a pregnant man? The Terminator with cramps and morning sickness? That was  all the teasing audiences needed to flock to this 1994 farce, which reunited Arnold with his director and costar fromTwins, Ivan Reitman and Danny De&nbsp;Vito. Reitman had also directed the Austrian muscleman inKindergarten Cop, and they brought the same breezy quality of those earlier films to this enjoyable fluff, in  which Arnold plays a scientist who uses his own body to test a revolutionary new fertility drug. His colleague De Vito  talks him into the experiment, which succeeds beyond their wildest expectations when Arnold begins a full-term  pregnancy. Emma Thompson offers a wealth of comedic support as the biologist who moves into Schwarzenegger's lab  while he's coping with his \"maternal\" condition, and Pamela Reed (who was also inKindergarten Cop) adds to  the fun as De&nbsp;Vito's pregnant ex-wife. What's surprising about this mainstream hit is not that it makes the most of  its absurd premise, but that it's also sweetly heartwarming in its treatment of role reversal and the joys and pains of  pregnancy. It's a good-natured vehicle for a different side of Schwarzenegger's star appeal, and the fact that it works at  all is a tribute to Reitman and his cleverly talented cast.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783226926", "0783225504", "B00005T7I2", "B0002J58HO", "6305767866", "B000056PMU", "B00013RC8E", "0767804309", "B000TJBN6W", "B00005T7I3", "B00004XMSC", "B00026ZG10", "B005XB8SRS", "B0001Z37HM", "B000068QPM", "B002GHHHME", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B000Y11B7Q", "B00005JKIP", "0783225946", "B001LMAK9C", "B00AKGG828", "6305803781", "B0000VD12I", "B00005T7HZ", "B000RJO56E", "B00008979F", "B000RW3VCK", "B00005N5S5", "B00000IQW2", "B00008977A", "B00070FX5U", "B000089771", "B00JVLGL2A", "B00AEFXPG2", "B0087ZG7NO", "B0000542C9", "B000063INF", "B00K8HALVI", "0767802497", "B00AMEZDN8", "B0000VV5BM", "0783241895", "B00386EZKE", "B00K8HAKSW", "0800177029", "B00018YC3M", "B00008L3S9", "B001VLBDD0", "B00HSSZKAW", "6305236569", "0783235070", "6305213305", "B008KEQMDC", "B000QQLVPQ", "B001OST0M6", "B000FC2FQA", "B00081U7HC", "1558908404", "B00020HAXI", "B00006AW63", "B00AEBB9WI", "B0006J28MI", "6305428395", "B00441GYQ0", "B00HLTD49C", "B002XUBDRY", "B00HQOFAKI", "B000E6ESI0", "0767807588", "0783226896", "B000TZJBPQ", "B0006GANOQ", "0783227396", "B00441GYY2", "B000IJ79X4", "B001G7Q0M8", "0767821769", "B000BUE5E6", "B001TK80C0", "B00BTYJYP8", "B001L2ZSJO", "B00008L3U1", "B007R915RE", "B0007GGYUC", "B001CQONNG", "B004X1M47O", "6305428549", "B0000DKDUV", "B000065V43", "B0009UZG3C", "B00009AOBM", "B004X1M3DE", "B000068MC1", "B000BPL2FQ", "0792844866", "B00008G8LY", "B00H1RMWYW", "B003UESJEW", "B002LFAHBE"], "bought_together": ["0783226926", "0783225504"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000RJO56E", "0783225504", "0783226926", "0800177975"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 46614}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "UNIVERSAL", "asin": "0783230370", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VBRQ7VGVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Junior"}

{"description": "Robert Cummings stars as Barry Kane, a patriotic munitions worker who is falsely accused of sabotage, in this wartime thriller from Alfred Hitchcock. Plastered across the front page of every newspaper and hated by the nation, Kane's only hope of clearing his name is to find the real villain. If this sounds a bit like Hitchcock's laterNorth by Northwest, it is. There are interesting echoes throughout, including a heart-stopping sequence on top of a national monument. But the most interesting thing aboutSaboteuris the frequency with which characters demonstrate their willingness to obstruct the police, going on nothing more than the fact that Kane seems like a stand-up guy. They do, again and again, apparently just because good people can spot other good people.Saboteurwas made during the thick of World War II, so there are a few passages of heavy-handed jingoism to get through but they're relatively painless. The script as a whole is a clever one--Algonquin wit Dorothy Parker shares a screenwriting credit, and her trademark zingers make for a terrific mix of humor and suspense.Saboteuris a pleasure whether you're a die-hard Hitchcock fan or just someone who likes a good nail-biter.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300183580", "0783235682"], "also_viewed": ["B001D8W7EA", "B000A1INJE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 450820}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.45, "brand": "", "asin": "0783236344", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5110R9HJEJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Saboteur [VHS]"}

{"description": "Do you know anyone who hasn't seen this movie? A box-office smash when released in 1993, this spectacular update of the popular 1960s TV series stars Harrison Ford as a surgeon wrongly accused of the murder of his wife. He escapes from a prison transport bus (in one of the most spectacular stunt-action sequences ever filmed) and embarks on a frantic quest for the true killer's identity, while a tenacious U.S. marshal (Tommy Lee Jones, in an Oscar-winning role) remains hot on his trail. Director Andrew Davis hit the big time with this expert display of polished style and escalating suspense, but it's the antagonistic chemistry between Jones and Ford that keeps this thriller cooking to the very end. In roles that seem custom-fit to their screen personas, the two stars maintain a sharply human focus to the grand-scale manhunt, and the intelligent screenplay never resorts to convenient escapes or narrative shortcuts. Equally effective as a thriller and a character study, this is a Hollywood blockbuster that truly deserves its ongoing popularity.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790736411", "0767803434", "B00AEBB9UK", "B00008K76W", "B002NZK5R8", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000055Y0Y", "B00008K76V", "B004IK30MI", "B002NZK5UU", "B000CEV3M8", "B0045HCJ8K", "B00AEFXYJA", "B00008K76U", "0783225733", "B0045HCJFS", "B000O77SRC", "B000F8DV1M", "B00AEBB9NM", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B000EGDB10", "0800141601", "B002AT8K9W", "6305428115", "B0006GANOQ", "B00026ZG10", "6304711891", "B003ASLJIQ", "6304806434", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00AEFYF2K", "B000NTMA0Q", "0783240295", "B002NZK5VO", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00015YVDG", "B00AEBB8YW", "0790732238", "B002GIBVVG", "B00004STDN", "B002AT8KAG", "B00AEFXBG6", "B00AEFXVOI", "B000SFOW8I", "B002VWNICC", "B000U1ZV8K", "B002GHHHP6", "B00009WVSL", "B00008G8M4", "B002AS464Q", "B000PHVZNE", "B003AWRMBA", "0790732149", "B0007IO6NM", "B001ECDVJU", "B00AEBBA2W", "0783226888", "B000QUCRB4", "6305213283", "6304765258", "6304765266", "6305133468", "B00005B6JZ", "B002O3Z50G", "B00000G3PA", "B0043X1FNQ", "B000FO0AA6", "B00003CXGV", "B004AOECXI", "B00096S49Y", "B0014C2FX8", "6305236569", "B003ASLJMW", "B0014Z4OMU", "B000P0J0EM", "0790730979", "B0006N2EZ0", "0783222149", "B001LXIDW2", "0783226942", "B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B00158K0QU", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00AEFXEGS", "0780618548", "0783235070", "B00004XPPG", "B0045HCJGC", "B000FO0A9W", "B0000AOV4I", "B000YCPUWW", "B00177YA1K", "630471193X", "B007SPPANM", "0792844874", "B00081U7HC"], "bought_together": ["0790736411", "0767803434"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000JYW5BE", "B004LWZW4M", "B000UBMSB8", "B0054OGQM8"]}, "price": 17.75, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 201394}, "asin": "079072961X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514VJP0EEHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Fugitive"}
{"description": "Thanks to the ambitious vision of director Tim Burton, the blockbuster hit of 1989 delivers the goods despite an occasionally spotty script, giving the caped crusader a thorough overhaul in keeping with the crime fighter's evolution in DC Comics. Michael Keaton strikes just the right mood as the brooding &quot;Dark Knight&quot; of Gotham City; Kim Basinger plays Gotham's intrepid reporter Vicki Vale; and Jack Nicholson goes wild as the maniacal and scene-stealing Joker, who plots a takeover of the city with his lethal Smilex gas. Triumphant Oscar-winning production design by the late Anton Furst turnsBatmaninto a visual feast, and Burton brilliantly establishes a darkly mythic approach to Batman's legacy. Danny Elfman's now-classic score propels the action with bold, muscular verve.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000P0J06U", "B001OST0LW", "B001OST0M6", "B00005JNJV", "B001GZ6QC4", "B000IJ79UW", "B004LWZWGA", "B00005LOUK", "B001AGXEAG", "B000IJ79WU", "B0000VD04M", "B00005JKCH", "B000IJ79XE", "B00AEBBA72", "B000IJ79X4", "B002VWNIDG", "B004LWZW42", "B00005JMQW", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001CK1D44", "B000J10EQU", "B009JBWOU0", "B0000AC8LI", "B0006L0LOS", "6304698739", "B001VLBDD0", "B001ECDVKE", "B0000959N0", "B008JFUPFI", "B000EGDB10", "B00LBHOCHS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B000OT6V64", "6304711891", "B002VWNID6", "B000AQOHNA", "B000AYELVA", "B00F4FFO8E", "B000A9QKL4", "B00DP9MDE4", "B00005JNTU", "B000BZISVM", "0780630890", "0780630882", "B0014Z4ON4", "B000RW3VCK", "B000P0J0AG", "B0090SI56Y", "B002GSXKN8", "B00005N7Z1", "B000AYELVU", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00005R2IS", "B004FQX5B6", "0790731924", "B00AEBB9NM", "B00007AJGH", "B00005T7I1", "B000P0J0A6", "B000M341QE", "B000P0J09M", "0792844866", "B004SIP95G", "B000VI70QS", "B004L9GMBC", "B00027JZ3E", "B0001BKAEY", "B000A9QKLE", "B0014C2FX8", "B000V4UFZK", "B003XURDAY", "B00008G8M5", "B00070FX5U", "B00GZ0ML2Y", "B000O77SQS", "B004SIP9Z6", "B0007G89FU", "B000UR9T8C", "B001QB9H1U", "B000RTB0R6", "B00177YA1K", "B00008G8M4", "B004SIP9O2", "B00AEBB9FA", "B00005ATZT", "B000FS9FCG", "B0009UZG28", "B000P0J09W", "B001CDR1FG", "B00005N5S5", "6305767866", "B0087F7VSY", "B00081912E", "B001TK80C0", "0780630858", "B004YJMQHI", "B00AEBB9DM", "B007K3JFUQ", "6304712987", "B0001GOH6Q"], "bought_together": ["B000P0J06U", "B001OST0LW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002GSXKN8", "B00005JNJV", "B000B5XOSO", "B00C2IGQBA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 141600}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.0, "brand": "WARNER STUDIOS", "asin": "0790729652", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41SYDPY4YPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Batman (1989)"}
{"description": "When Tim Burton and Michael Keaton announced that they'd had enough of theBatmanfranchise, director Joel Schumacher stepped in (with Burton as coproducer) to make this action-packed extravaganza starring Val Kilmer as the caped crusader. Batman is up against two of Gotham City's most colorful criminals, the Riddler (a role tailor-made for funnyman Jim Carrey) and the diabolical Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones), who join forces to conquer Gotham's population with a brain-draining device. Nicole Kidman plays the seductive psychologist who wants to know what makes Batman tick. Boasting a redesigned Batmobile and plenty of new Bat hardware,Batman Foreveralso introduces Robin the Boy Wonder (Chris O'Donnell) whose close alliance with Batman led more than a few critics to ponder the series' homoerotic subtext. No matter how you interpret it, Schumacher's take on theBatmanlegacy is simultaneously amusing, lavishly epic, and prone to chronic sensory overload.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001OST0M6", "B000P0J06U", "B000P0J06K", "B00005JNJV", "B004LWZWGA", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00005LOUK", "B0006L0LOS", "B000IJ79X4", "B000IJ79XE", "B001CDR1FG", "B000IJ79WU", "B004YJMQDW", "B000J10EQU", "B00IZZDWKM", "B0000959N0", "B000AYELVA", "B00003CXE4", "B00005JKWJ", "B000AQOHNA", "B004LWZW42", "B00008G8M5", "B000IJ79UW", "0780624890", "B001DHXT20", "B002GSXKN8", "B0009UZG28", "B00005JNTU", "B000AYELVU", "B000A9QKLE", "B000A9QKL4", "B001GCUO1Q", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001VLBDD0", "B008JFUPFI", "B0090SI56Y", "B000068MBS", "B004EPZ07K", "B00081912E", "B005COPWZW", "0783235070", "B00BTYMPUY", "B004SIP9P6", "B000OYC7BW", "B00005JMQW", "B004SIP9O2", "B0007G89FU", "B001QB9H1U", "B000VI70QS", "B0014Z4ON4", "B000NIBURQ", "B001DJLD2G", "B000UR9T8C", "B00K7IPFSM", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000A9QKLO", "B000IJ79VQ", "B00F4FFO8E", "B00005JKCH", "B000ARXF96", "B0007V6ITE", "0790732157", "B0002IQMAM", "B00AEBB9SM", "B00005N5S5", "B000P0J06A", "B00GZ0ML2Y", "B00JL6L4UY", "B001AGXEAG", "B001ECDVKE", "B000GETUDI", "B005LAIHYU", "B008JFUS0U", "B001PPLIEG", "B000W1V5VU", "B001QTXM5Y", "B000HCO83Q", "B004SIP9MY", "6304765258", "B002GOAH1A", "B00JPS7HOA", "B00E5I2MCM", "B005LAIGW8", "B00006FI0R", "B00177YA1K", "B0007P0Y7C", "B001GCUO0W", "B0000B00KB", "B00080ZFZW", "B002GHHHN8", "B003AWRM9W", "B008JFUO72", "B00005JNTI", "B000HT38BM", "B0049IHWYG", "B00JF5GAIW", "B0009RCPY8", "B0000VCZMK", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B005J9ZFQG"], "bought_together": ["B001OST0M6", "B000P0J06U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002GSXKN8", "B000P0J06K", "B000B5XOSO", "B00005JNJV"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 161577}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.18, "brand": "Warner Bros", "asin": "0790731002", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51V0HRD00TL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Batman Forever"}
{"description": "When Prince's dazzling and dynamicPurple Rain(movie and soundtrack album) and the hypnotic hit single &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; exploded onto the pop-culture scene in 1984, it seemed there was nothing the purple one couldn't do. The film is basically a feature-length music video, but no musician has ever had a better big-screen showcase for his many talents.  The plot is really just a theme (about the son of an abusive father struggling not to continue the pattern) upon which to hang some of Prince's most dazzling songs (including &quot;Let's Go Crazy&quot; and the title tune), and some sizzling live-concert numbers.  Apollonia Kotero is ravishing as the romantic interest, and Morris Day and the Time provide some terrific musical competition.Purple Rainis an essential artifact of the mid-'80s pop Zeitgeist.

{"description": "When Ridley Scott's cut ofBlade Runnerwas finally released in 1993, one had to wonder why the studio hadn't done it right the first time--11 years earlier. This version is so much better, mostly because of what's been eliminated (the ludicrous and redundant voice-over narration and the phony happy ending) rather than what's been added (a bit more character development and a brief unicorn dream). Star Harrison Ford originally recorded the narration under duress at the insistence of Warner Bros. executives who thought the story needed further \"explanation\"; he later confessed that he thought if he did it badly they wouldn't use it. (Moral: Never overestimate the taste of movie executives.) The movie's spectacular futuristic vision of Los Angeles--a perpetually dark and rainy metropolis that's the nightmare antithesis of \"Sunny Southern California\"--is still its most seductive feature, an otherworldly atmosphere in which you can immerse yourself. The movie's shadowy visual style, along with its classic private-detective/murder-mystery plot line (with Ford on the trail of a murderous android, or \"replicant\"), makesBlade Runnerone of the few science fiction pictures to legitimately claim a place in the film noir tradition. And, as in the best noir, the sleuth discovers a whole lot more (about himself and the people he encounters) than he anticipates.... With Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, Daryl Hannah, Rutger Hauer, and M. Emmet Walsh.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783225903", "B004L9GMBC", "0783226063", "B00000ILDD", "0800195175", "B0018O4YT0", "B0007PALZ2", "B00004Y87O", "B003ELKNH2", "B00AEFYDM2", "B0002CHIKG", "B00005ATQB", "B00005JL78", "0790729342", "B0045HCJKS", "0767830555", "B0002CHK1S", "B00005N5S5", "B000063JDE", "B000P0J0AQ", "B00005R2IS", "B0013LL2Z2", "B00I9TDMRM", "B0045HCJ9O", "B008MIMWP8", "B0045HCJ0S", "B00005JLWN", "B00005N7Z1", "B000YBKO6U", "B0006GAOJA", "B0007DFJ0G", "B001WLMOL4", "B00003CXXP", "6304698798", "B00000JSJC", "B000286RP2", "B003AWRMCE", "B0040QYROA", "0783228457", "B004SIP9Z6", "B002ZG980U", "079284646X", "B00079Z9VO", "B002VWNIAY", "B00005J75F", "B005LAIHXQ", "B000VECAD0", "B0000VCZK2", "B00005PJ8T", "0345404475", "B001DJLD1M", "0792839056", "B0045HCJ9E", "B0050FXDDQ", "B0045HCJGC", "B004SIP95G", "B007STBUHI", "B00006ADD5", "B00GHJ1YUI", "B003ZXDP0Q", "B000A7DVR2", "0790731932", "B000NA1WGS", "B00AMSLDTM", "B008JFUN50", "B0068FZ0O2", "B000QUCQX8", "B000E6ESEO", "B00AEFXN9G", "B004FQX5B6", "B0002KVUKM", "B0016I0AJG", "B007FQXEWI", "B000N6TX1I", "B002VWNIDG", "B00ENNBZ68", "B00K5EJHGO", "B001VLBDD0", "078401213X", "0780022343", "B0018CMJSU", "B005LAII3A", "B000OVLBHG", "B006TTC5HC", "B0049985XW", "B0000844I8", "B00005JKFR", "B00AEFY3MC", "B000BZISSU", "0783226837", "6305133476", "B000022TSY", "B000FS9FCG", "B00070FX5U", "B008MIMWQW", "B00AEBBADG", "B004GJYRKA", "B002Z7FWBI", "B000BR9S96", "B00000K3TS"], "bought_together": ["B004L9GMBC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005LAIHXQ", "B009JBWOU0", "B00HUCF7AO", "B0018O4YT0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 68358}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.21, "brand": "WARNER BROTHERS", "asin": "0790729628", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ST8TQP63L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)"}
{"description": "One of the key films of the 1970s, John Boorman'sDeliveranceis a nightmarish adaptation of poet-novelist James Dickey's book about various kinds of survival in modern America. The story concerns four Atlanta businessmen of various male stripe: Jon Voight's character is a reflective, civilized fellow, Burt Reynolds plays a strapping hunter-gatherer in urban clothes, Ned Beatty is a sweaty, weak-willed boy-man, and Ronny Cox essays a spirited, neighborly type. Together they decide to answer the ancient call of men testing themselves against the elements and set out on a treacherous ride on the rapids of an Appalachian river. What they don't understand until it is too late is that they have ventured into Dickey's variation on the American underbelly, a wild, lawless, dangerous (and dangerously inbred) place isolated from the gloss of the late 20th century. In short order, the four men dig deep into their own suppressed primitiveness, defending themselves against armed cretins, facing the shock of real death on their carefully planned, death-defying adventure, and then squarely facing the suspicions of authority over their concealed actions. Boorman, a master teller of stories about individuals on peculiarly mythical journeys, does a terrifying and beautiful job of revealing the complexity of private and collective character--the way one can never be the same after glimpsing the sharp-clawed survivor in one's soul.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000FZCU", "6305123616", "0783222955", "6300214060"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 659130}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0790732009", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513K3CXF8QL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Deliverance (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "One of the funniest films in many a moon was hiding at art house  theaters in 1998. FormerSaturday Night Livecomedian and Spinal Tap member Christopher Guest creates the ultimate parody of small-town dramatics,Waiting for Guffman. Corky St. Claire (Guest), an overwhelming drama director hiding out in Blaine, Missouri, thinks he has found the vehicle to put him back on Broadway:  the city's 150th anniversary play,Red, White, and Blaine.As rehearsals start, we learn of the town's history (\"the stool capital of the world\") including a brush with a UFO. The mockumentary follows the various townsfolk wishing for stardom: Parker Posey as a Dairy Queen clerk, Catherine O'Hara and Fred Willard as stage-struck travel agents, Matthew Keeslar as the town's bad boy, and Eugene Levy (who cowrote the film with Guest) as a dentist who dreams of glory on the stage. The film is a hoot from beginning to end, and be sure to watch the closing credits.

{"description": "While the series pilotBabylon 5: The Gatheringestablishes the characters and introduces the conflicts that will become central to the series, it also draws upon a rich history that is continually alluded to but never fully explained.Babylon 5: In the Beginning, produced in the hiatus between the fourth and fifth seasons of the series, packs all that history--and more--into a prequel stuffed to the hatches with the epic doings of Earth, Minbar, Narn, and Centauri in the days before theBabylonstations were built. Told in almost fairy-tale fashion by Londo Molari to a pair of children, the movie explicates the ill-fated first meeting between representatives of Earth and Minbar, the devastating war, the sudden surrender, and the universe-altering secret of Jeffrey Sinclair. It also gives the early histories of characters who will become central to the series, in particular Londo and G'Kar. Ostensibly created to catch recent converts up with the series as it made its transition to a new network, the movie is infused with the epic sweep and storytelling confidence producer-writer Michael J. Straczynski and his cast and crew had developed by the fourth season. It's an elegant, compelling addition to theBabylon 5universe and a dramatic highlight of the series. As an introduction, though, it gives away the mystery that pervades the shadowy history slowly revealed through the first three seasons--it's actually better seen from the vantage point of the fifth season.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000CEXFYW", "B002BAW6GS"], "also_viewed": ["B00005NTNP"]}, "price": 9.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 555635}, "asin": "0790736691", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X1T25ZCWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Babylon 5: In the Beginning [VHS]"}
{"description": "From yet another derivative science fiction novel by Michael Crichton comes this equally derivative and flaccid movie, in which three top Hollywood stars struggle to squeeze tension and excitement out of material that doesn't match their talents. You're supposed to find awe and mystery in Crichton's story about a team of scientists and scholars who discover a 300-year-old alien spacecraft deep on the ocean floor, but mostly you feel that this is all much ado about nothing. The exploration team consists of a psychologist (Dustin Hoffman), mathematician (Samuel L. Jackson), biochemist (Sharon Stone), and an astrophysicist (Liev Schreiber), and when they enter the alien ship they discover a mysterious sphere inside. What they don't know is that the sphere has the power to manipulate their thoughts and perceptions, and before long the scientists' undersea habitat is a veritable haunted house of frightening visions and creeping paranoia. Who can be trusted? What is the sphere's purpose, and why is it on the ocean floor?Spheremakes some attempt to answer these questions, but the film is a mess, and it leads to one of the most anticlimactic endings of any science fiction film ever made. There are moments of high intensity and psychological suspense, and the stellar cast works hard to boost the talky screenplay. But it's clear that this was a hurried production (Hoffman and director Barry Levinson madeWag the Dogduring an extended production delay), and as a resultSpherelooks and feels like a film that wasn't quite ready for the cameras. Though it's by no means a waste of time, it's undeniably disappointing.

{"description": "Director Oliver Stone added 17 minutes of previously unseen footage for the &quot;director's cut&quot; edition of his hypnotic courtroom epic about the investigation into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in November 1963. That fateful day in Dallas set in motion a sequence of events that would only intensify the mystery behind Kennedy's death, causing New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) to begin an investigation that would gradually become a personal obsession. Bravura filmmaking combined with controversial treatment of historical facts and audacious speculation, this breathtaking revision of history presents a mesmerizing parade of shady figures and conspiracy theories, unfolding like a classic mystery based on history's greatest unsolved crime. A technical triumph boasting Oscar-winning cinematography and editing, Stone's film is guaranteed to grab the viewer's attention with its daring take on the JFK controversy.

{"description": "A surprise sleeper hit when released in 1992, this romantic fantasy works as a comedic adventure and a gentle tearjerker thanks to Mel Gibson's appealing performance. He plays Daniel, a daring test pilot who is deeply distraught by the apparent death of his girlfriend, Helen, in 1939. Feeling little reason to live, he volunteers for a pioneering cryogenics experiment and is thawed out 50 years later by two young boys. They bring the confused pilot home to Nat's single mom, Claire (Jamie Lee Curtis). There's a hint of romance, but Daniel desperately needs to know if Helen really died in 1939, and he discovers that love has a way of surviving a half-century leap in time. The premise is hokey and certain plot details are conveniently ignored, but Gibson, Curtis, and Elijah Wood (as Nat) hold it together with irresistible charm and just the right balance of fantasy and drama.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000IQW5", "B00004W46I", "B00019073K", "630471193X", "B002GHHHP6", "6305213283", "B002GOAGZC", "0783227396", "0783230079", "B001CW8016", "630542845X", "B000FO0A9W", "B000FO0AA6", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00AEBB9WI", "B002NZK5TQ", "B005FQ2H8W", "6305428514", "B001C47ZOW", "0783226810", "6305133468", "B001BGS17Q", "B00005RRK1", "B0045HCJRQ", "B00AEFY4CG", "B004SIP8JI", "6304765266", "0783226896", "B000NA1WDQ", "B000JYW5B4", "B001ECDVK4", "0767810856", "B002GHHHKQ", "B00D2UMHGA", "B0045HCJ9E", "B003ASLJPE", "B000CEV3M8", "6305428506", "B00AEBB8NS", "0783225733", "6305236569", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B001ECDVJU", "B002GIBVV6", "B0068FZ0GK", "B0000A2ZO0", "B0002TSZI8", "B0039QPVRY", "B000FOPPC4", "630587493X", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00003CWU3", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000065V3L", "B005F2JRUC", "B00007GZR5", "B004SIP9RO", "B00008G8M4", "B004SIP8LG", "B00004YA66", "B000YDBPAM", "B004AOECXI", "B000P0J0CY", "B00407PNY2", "B003AWRMBA", "B0000AOV4I", "B000ENC5YW", "0783230591", "B000Y11B7Q", "B00081912E", "B00008G7UF", "B00008DDXA", "B007JNR4WI", "B002GHHHPQ", "B001BGS16W", "0790731932", "B00158K0QU", "B002GHHHHO", "B00005T7I1", "B0000542C9"], "bought_together": ["B00004W46I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004W46I", "B00000IQW5", "B002GHHHP6", "630471193X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 98219}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.12, "brand": "Forever", "asin": "0790731916", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z75D1Y4XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Forever Young (Snap Case)"}
{"description": "Little did Tom Cruise know that he would become a box-office superstar after he cranked up some Bob Seeger and played air guitar in his underwear. But there's more to this 1983 hit than the arrival of a hot young star. Making a stylish debut, writer-director Paul Brickman crafted a subtle satire of crass materialism wrapped in an irresistible plot about a crafty high schooler named Joel (Cruise) who goes into risky business with the beguiling prostitute Lana (Rebecca De Mornay) while his parents are out of town. Joel turns his affluent Chicago-suburb home into a lucrative bordello and forms a steamy personal and professional partnership with Lana, but only as long as the two can avoid the vengeful pimp Guido (Joe Pantoliano) and keep their customers happy. A signature film of the 1980s,Risky Businessstill holds up thanks to Cruise's effortless charm and the movie's timeless appeal as an adolescent male fantasy.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000065V3G", "B00AEFXXMI", "B000GAKDAG", "B0002WZTOI", "B00AG473GE", "B0043X1FOU", "B00AEFXR1K", "B00AEFXZ1C", "B00AEFXZJE", "B00029RTCG", "B006TTC50Y", "B001AEF6C2", "B0000DIXDR", "B001AEF6BI", "0800141741", "B001AEF6BS", "B0000YEEGM", "B000065V3H", "B00AEFY4CG", "B002JOUNE8", "B00AEFXYJA", "B000HEZESM", "B000FI8MPW", "B000G6BLHY", "B00005JLFA", "6305428050", "B001680M26", "B00AG475K8", "0783226810", "B00013WWT8", "B0043X1FKO", "B00AEFY5TI", "B00AEBB99Q", "B003CRM6PA", "B001BGS16W", "B0045O2PF0", "B000P0J09W", "B00005B6JZ", "B0000A02TZ", "B00AEFYRP0", "B000PHX5NM", "B0002V7ON8", "B000E5N684", "B000EGDB10", "B001AGXEAG", "B00AEFYVMO", "B0000542CI", "B00005JKCB", "B000M341QY", "B0015NORDW", "6305236569", "B0038Z5T4Q", "B000065U1Q", "B00081U7HC", "6305308837", "B00AEBB9ZK", "B005QX8UEE", "6305213305", "B005LL817W", "B002D0L0QS", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B00005JL78", "B000U1ZV8K", "B002O3Z510", "B0053TWVR8", "B000V4UFZK", "0792838041", "B000SFOW8I", "B003HKN52U", "B00005JNTI", "B000035Z5G", "B000HC2LHG", "B0009HLD4Q", "B00005JKFA", "B001LXIDVI", "B0009IOR5M", "B002ZG9864", "B00AEBB9IM", "B00015YVD6", "B00AEFXDO6", "B0053TWVQ4", "B0010YSD8Q", "B00003CXIP", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B006N9OEEK", "B000QXDCLA", "B00005JN2Z", "B00008G8LM", "B0068FZ0GK", "B002O3Z4YI", "B00009OWJW", "B00AEBB9LO", "B000FO0AA6", "B003QO8TOQ", "B002AT8KAG", "B000MGBSE4", "B000P0J0A6", "B000PMFRYC", "B002VWNID6", "B000ZM1MG4"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFXXMI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFXXMI", "B006TTC50Y", "B000065V3H", "B001AEF6BS"]}, "price": 10.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 173049}, "asin": "0790732203", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5112AYVBDXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Risky Business"}
{"description": "Running time 127 minutes, Black and White, with original theatrical trailer. Starring Humphrey Bogart and Walter Huston, Tim Holt and Bruce Bennett, directed by John Huston.\n\nGold in the hills, avarice in the hearts of men. Two hard-luck drifters (Bogart and Holt) and a grizzled prospector (Huston) discover gold. Then greed and paranoia set in.\n\nShot mostly on location in Mexico, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre cost a then-whopping $3 million - and led to a showdown. At that price, Jack Warner argued, the top-billed Bogart shouldn't be bumped off before the finale. But director John Huston stood his ground and went on to win high honors: two Academy Awards for his direction and screenplay. And his father won the Oscar as Best Supporting Actor. Without awards, but with enduring acclaim, is Bogart's performance, transforming before our eyes from a likable hobo to a heartless thug who simmers in his own greed. A half-century later, its placement on the American Film Institute's Top 100 American Film list confirms it's still a powerful movie.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790743159", "6301968948", "6301797906", "0783222955", "B000BWIZRW", "B000BWIZTU", "6304429274", "6303402070", "0800100832", "6301978110", "6304196954", "6304111398", "630150528X", "6302816254", "B00000F13T", "0792839846", "6301977165", "6302227127", "6303109950", "6302158176", "630233683X", "0792837371", "6302353785", "630018627X", "6302032245", "0790734079", "B00005A1VH", "0792837967", "0800125762", "B00000FZCU", "6300215512", "0800132009", "0792837630", "6301801954", "630266232X", "0790743531", "6302226899", "1558807780", "1569942072", "6301800974", "6302909023", "6304259131", "6301805615", "6301798759", "B000PYKZYC", "B000006914", "0790748169", "6303393985", "6300216012", "6300268470", "B000077VT7"], "bought_together": ["0790743159"], "also_viewed": ["6305123616", "0783216084", "6303402070", "6304429274", "6301797906", "1558807780"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 418473}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0790743523", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HQXK3ZV4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre [VHS]"}

{"description": "Novelist Leon Uris wrote the script for this Western directed by John Sturges (The Magnificent Seven) and based on the life and times of Wyatt Earp (Burt Lancaster) and his sickly companion, Doc Holliday (Kirk Douglas). The action inevitably leads to the legendary battle between the two heroes and the villainous Clanton gang, but the film is also very much about the conflicts each man faces with women, with one another, and with their own destinies. Lancaster is terrific as the downbeat Earp, and Douglas has one of his best roles as the consumptive Holliday.

{"description": "A stupendous historical saga,Braveheartwon five Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director for star Mel Gibson. He plays William Wallace, a 13th-century Scottish commoner who unites the various clans against a cruel English King, Edward the Longshanks (Patrick McGoohan). The scenes of hand-to-hand combat are brutally violent, but they never glorify the bloodshed. There is such enormous scope to this story that it works on a smaller, more personal scale as well, essaying love and loss, patriotism and passion. Extremely moving, it reveals Gibson as a multitalented performer and remarkable director with an eye for detail and an understanding of human emotion. (His first directorial effort was 1993'sMan Without a Face.) The film is nearly three hours long and includes several plot tangents, yet is never dull.

{"description": "Mel Gibson's Oscar-winning 1995Braveheartis an impassioned epic about William Wallace, the 13th-century Scottish leader of a popular revolt against England's tyrannical Edward I (Patrick McGoohan). Gibson cannily plays Wallace as a man trying to stay out of history's way until events force his hand, an attribute that instantly resonates with several of the actor's best-known roles, especiallyMad Max. The subsequent camaraderie and courage Wallace shares in the field with fellow warriors is pure enough and inspiring enough to bring envy to a viewer, and even as things go wrong for Wallace in the second half, the film does not easily cave in to a somber tone. One of the most impressive elements is the originality with which Gibson films battle scenes, featuring hundreds of extras wielding medieval weapons. After Eisenstein'sAlexander Nevsky, Orson Welles'sChimes at Midnight, and even Kenneth Branagh'sHenry V, you might think there is little new that could be done in creating scenes of ancient combat; yet Gibson does it.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004XPQ6", "B00003CXE6", "6303953425", "6304935811", "B0001VL30O", "B000054OW2", "6302415853", "0790741512", "6304071876", "6301792734", "6303168507", "6303942830", "0800125762", "6300183211", "B000007OY0", "B000056BRF", "6300214540", "B000065U6Q", "B00004WIDB", "B00003CXTF", "B00007KK15", "079070546X", "B0000A36J1", "B00000K3AN", "6302482712", "6300263673", "6305169187", "0788811355", "B00003BE3X", "0800116917", "6304414099", "6303020089", "0792133153", "0790744589", "6302909023", "0800132009", "079212569X", "6300185095", "6303313345", "0767819462", "6304259131", "B00000K2SC", "0800199421", "B0001DI5W6", "B00005JLTM", "630018224X", "0790701251", "6304151306", "6303696813", "0790731274", "0792147618", "B00005RIJ3", "6301586026", "6302945089", "0783223218", "6305718792"], "bought_together": ["B00004XPQ6", "B00003CXE6"], "also_viewed": ["0792151712", "6303314015", "6301966988", "6303402348", "B00004WIDB", "0792116887", "6300213668", "0800125762", "B00004XPQ6", "0792842111", "B00003CXTF", "0788812408", "6302526574", "6303215734", "0788806270", "6300183211", "B00004U8P4", "0788802194"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 521725}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.5, "brand": "", "asin": "0792139771", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PF2QYK62L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Braveheart (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "When the theatrical release of James Cameron'sTitanicwas delayed from July to December of 1997, media pundits speculated that Cameron's $200&nbsp;million disaster epic would cause the director's downfall, signal the end of the blockbuster era, and sink Paramount Studios as quickly as the ill-fated luxury liner had sunk on that fateful night of April&nbsp;14, 1912. Some studio executives were confident, others horrified, but the clarity of hindsight turned Cameron into an Oscar-winning genius, a shrewd businessman, and one of the most successful directors in the history of motion pictures.Titanicwould surpass the $1&nbsp;billion mark in global box-office receipts (largely due to multiple viewings, the majority by teenage girls), win 11&nbsp;Academy Awards including best picture and director, produce the best-selling movie soundtrack of all time, and make a global superstar of Leonardo DiCaprio. A bona fide pop-cultural phenomenon, the film has all the ingredients of a blockbuster (romance, passion, luxury, grand scale, a snidely villain, and an epic, life-threatening crisis), but Cameron's alchemy of these ingredients proved more popular than anyone could have predicted. His stroke of genius was to combine absolute authenticity with a pair of fictional lovers whose tragic fate would draw viewers into the heart-wrenching reality of theTitanicdisaster. As starving artist Jack Dawson and soon-to-be-married socialite Rose DeWitt Bukater, DiCaprio and Kate Winslet won the hearts of viewers around the world, and their brief but never-forgotten love affair provides the humanity that Cameron needed to turnTitanicinto an emotional experience. Present-day framing scenes (featuring Gloria Stuart as the 101-year-old Rose) add additional resonance to the story, and although some viewers proved vehemently immune to Cameron's manipulations, few can deny the production's impressive achievements. Although some of the computer-generated visual effects look artificial, others--such as the sunset silhouette ofTitanicduring its first evening at sea, or the climactic splitting of the ship's sinking hull--are state-of-the-art marvels. In terms of sets and costumes alone, the film is never less than astounding. More than anything else, however, the film's overwhelming popularity speaks for itself.Titanicis an event film and a monument to Cameron's risk-taking audacity, blending the tragic irony of theTitanicdisaster with just enough narrative invention to give the historical event its fullest and most timeless dramatic impact.Titanicis an epic love story on par withGone with the Wind, and like that earlier box-office phenomenon, it's a film for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305123616", "6304117752", "6301792734", "6303215734", "B00000JS61", "6304178352", "6303396623", "6303314015", "B00003CXTF", "0769403468", "6301734734", "6302936381", "6303300480", "6305368139", "B00005RRG3", "6302610702", "0792839846", "6300207919", "B000P0J0C4", "6304546262", "B000056BRF", "6304400551", "6303101267", "630150528X", "6303637574", "B000P0J0EW", "6305126062", "6302935148", "0800199421", "6304681496", "0792116887", "6301963911", "B0000DCGT1", "B00001IVED", "6305169187", "B00006RCST", "6300216721", "630197879X", "0800113055", "076780922X", "080010367X", "0800141326", "0800184319", "6304039522", "B000066AXC"], "bought_together": ["6305123616"], "also_viewed": ["B009VQHDSQ", "6303314015", "B0074JODXU", "B00003CXTF", "B003JQZXWW", "6302787068", "6301796535", "0788812807", "0788806270", "B00005JKDQ", "6304500831", "6305229449", "6304117752", "6300213668", "6304089767", "B0000AQZYM", "079213690X", "6303049079", "6305123616", "6303402348", "6301792734", "0788812408", "B00079HZSE", "B000035Z2S", "B00000K3AN", "0788805843", "6302526574", "B0000029YC", "6303534422", "6303215734", "B0070285YE", "B00008LDO9", "0783216084", "6304434340", "B00BBND56G", "0788805533", "6300183211", "6302320402", "6305750750", "B0002CHI3S", "0790748266", "6304143184", "B0000040CM", "B005X7H9SQ", "B00004RFHF", "B00005V1Z7", "6302814782", "6301572688", "B00000JS61", "B008SLUWZG", "6303257844", "B00078XGO2", "0790736039", "B0000040EJ", "B000065U6Q", "B00003CX7L", "B00000ADKZ", "6300263673", "6302178924"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 65950}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.47, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "0792151712", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21BAWEVBJ1L.jpg", "title": "Titanic [VHS]"}
{"description": "The first, and only, X-rated film to win a best picture Academy Award, John Schlesinger'sMidnight Cowboyseems a lot less daring today (and has been reclassified as an R), but remains a fascinating time capsule of late-1960s sexual decadence in mainstream American cinema. In a career-making performance, Jon Voight plays Joe Buck, a naive Texas dishwasher who goes to the big city (New York) to make his fortune as a sexual hustler. Although enthusiastic about selling himself to rich ladies for stud services, he quickly finds it hard to make a living and eventually crashes in a seedy dump with a crippled petty thief named Ratzo Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman, doing one of his more effective &quot;stupid acting tricks,&quot; with a limp and a high-pitch rasp of a voice). Schlesinger's quick-cut, semi-psychedelic style has dated severely, as has his ruthlessly cynical approach to almost everybody but the lead characters. But at its heart the movie is a sad tale of friendship between a couple of losers lost in the big city, and with an ending no studio would approve today. It's a bit like an urbanOf Mice and Men, but where both guys are Lenny.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00079Z9VO", "0767830555", "B0006GANN2", "B000XJD34I", "B000022TSY", "B000RTB0R6", "B006TTC5HC", "B0010AN7Z4", "B0006GAOJA", "B004FQX5B6", "B00003CXBU", "6304907729", "B00005MEOU", "B00005M2CO", "B00AEFXN9G", "B0000549B1", "B0008ENHUI", "B0009S4IKQ", "B00005JKF6", "B003ELKNH2", "B000CNESTE", "B000ZM1MG4", "B00005AUKE", "B000BYA4HE", "B00006RCO2", "B00004XPPC", "B0006HBV3W", "B00011D1OK", "B00066FBQG", "B0002KPHZG", "B000BITV92", "B0010YVCI4", "B00AEFYSWM", "B000CEXEWA", "B000LPR6GA", "B0000YEEGM", "B00003CXB5", "B0001US8F8", "B000ZM1MGE", "0780021312", "B000CNESU8", "B0050FXDDQ", "B001EOQCMG", "B00006RCO1", "B00AATV07S", "B00782O7IY", "B00004TVUD", "B002VWNIBI", "0767827902", "076781326X", "B0049985XW", "0783240171", "B00012FXJ0", "B0087ZG7OI", "B0019L21GA", "B001GUYAZY", "6305918880", "B000EHSVS2", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B00000DQWS", "B00011D1OU", "B00002VWE0", "B00006RCO3", "B004SIP7F8", "B00AEFY6DI", "6304712936", "B003INBNOS", "B00AEBB95K", "B004L9GMBC", "079284646X", "B00AEBB9FA", "B003ZEQMH8", "B00AEBB89C", "B000LP6KNU", "B0019UGYK0", "B001D8W7EU", "B006FE83UE", "B000KJTGHO", "0792846109", "B0088XQBXQ", "B0087ZG7R0", "B007N31YH0", "B003O7I6SE", "B00AEFZDNA", "B000055Y0X", "B0019L770A", "B003LMPKSQ", "B000UJ48SQ", "B009NYF2GQ", "B000KX0IOA", "B004SIP9U6", "B00006ADD5", "B0045HCJTO", "0792838408", "B0045HCJ94", "B0045HCJ8U", "B000P0J09M", "B002VWNIAY", "B00008RH3J", "B005KQVE1S"], "bought_together": ["B00079Z9VO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004FQX5B6", "B006TTC5HC", "B0006GANN2", "B0000YEEGM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 4113}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "MGM", "asin": "0792833287", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C3ME80X6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Midnight Cowboy"}
{"description": "Welcome to Delos, the high-tech Disneyland for adults that Michael Crichton created forWestworld, a nifty science fiction thriller from 1973 that also marked the popular novelist's feature-film directorial debut. The movie is so named because the vacationing buddies who travel to Delos (James Brolin, Richard Benjamin) choose Westworld as their destination (the other choices being Roman World and Medieval World), where they are free to indulge their movie-inspired fantasies of the Wild West.  From brothel beauties to black-hatted gunslingers (like the villain played by Yul Brynner), the place is populated by perfectly humanlike robots programmed and monitored to cater to every guest's fancy. But fun turns into abject horror when the robots--particularly Brynner's badman--begin to malfunction and Delos turns into an amusement park that's anything but amusing.Westworldhas moments of camp and the look of a low-budget backlot production, but two decades before Crichton revamped his idea to createJurassic Park, this movie made the most of its interesting and exciting premise.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300181987", "6303471552", "6300213676", "6301977742", "6300213838", "6301971582", "6300147630", "0790731975", "6302890721", "6300271781", "0784011923", "6301977815", "630442972X", "6301327845", "0790733897", "6300181537", "B000007PI4", "6301968948", "6301971426", "0792846311", "6300183084", "6300181472", "6300181464", "6302814723", "0792845684", "0790733927", "6302182522"], "bought_together": ["6303471552"], "also_viewed": ["6302969352", "6303471552"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 375477}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.98, "brand": "", "asin": "0792835077", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B90XC72EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Westworld [VHS]"}
{"description": "Maybe \"nobody's perfect,\" as one character in this masterpiece suggests. But some movies are perfect, andSome Like It Hotis one of them. In Chicago, during the Prohibition era, two skirt-chasing musicians, Joe and Jerry (Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon), inadvertently witness the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. In order to escape the wrath of gangland chief Spats Colombo (George Raft), the boys, in drag, join an all-woman band headed for Florida. They vie for the attention of the lead singer, Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe), a much-disappointed songbird who warbles \"I'm Through with Love\" but remains vulnerable to yet another unreliable saxophone player. (When Curtis courts her without his dress, he adopts the voice of Cary Grant--a spot-on impersonation.) The script by director Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond is beautifully measured; everything works, like a flawless clock. Aspiring screenwriters would be well advised to throw away the how-to books and simply study this film. The bulk of the slapstick is handled by an unhinged Lemmon and the razor-sharp Joe E. Brown, who plays a horny retiree smitten by Jerry's feminine charms. For all the gags, the film is also wonderfully romantic, as Wilder indulges in just the right amounts of moonlight and the lilting melody of \"Park Avenue Fantasy.\"Some Like It Hotis so delightfully fizzy, it's hard to believe the shooting of the film was a headache, with an unhappy Monroe on her worst behavior.

{"description": "One of the most critically acclaimed films of 1995, this wrenchingly sad but extraordinarily moving drama provides an authentic, superbly acted portrait of two people whose lives intersect just as they've reached their lowest depths of despair. Ben (Nicolas Cage, in an Oscar-winning performance) is a former movie executive who's lost his wife and family in a sea of alcoholic self-destruction. He's come to Las Vegas literally to drink himself to death, and that's when he meets Sera (Elisabeth Shue), a prostitute who falls in love with him--and he with her--despite their mutual dead-end existence. They accept each other as they are, with no attempts by one to change the other, and this unconditional love turnsLeaving Las Vegasinto a somber yet quietly beautiful love story. Earning Oscar nominations for Best Director (Mike Figgis), Best Adapted Screenplay (Figgis, from John O'Brien's novel) and Best Actress (Shue), the film may strike some as relentlessly bleak and glacially paced, but attentive viewers will readily discover the richness of these tragic characters and the exceptional performances that bring them to life.

{"description": "Nora Ephron wrote the brisk screenplay for this 1989 romantic comedy, director Rob Reiner made a nicely glossy New York story (very much in a Woody Allen vein) out of it, and Billy Crystal's unstoppable charm made it something really special. Crystal and Meg Ryan play longtime platonic friends who keep dancing around their deeper feelings for one another, and Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher are their respective pals who fall in love and get married. Ryan doesn't get a lot of funny material, but her performance is typically alive and intuitive, and she more than holds her own with Crystal's comic motor mouth and sweet sentimentality. Reiner is on comfortable ground, liberated from the burden of making serious statements in the lead-footed manner of subsequent features.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302936381", "6301796535", "6301963911", "B000YDBPAM", "6305123616", "6300263673", "6301412761", "0792839846", "B001DZFYPW", "6303215734", "630339406X", "6300215695", "B00008FEBU", "6304457324", "0783215096", "6302842263", "0790732017"], "bought_together": ["6302936381", "6301796535"], "also_viewed": ["6302936381", "B00000F5PI", "6303402348", "B00158K0QU", "0792837894", "B00AEFXXMI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 254468}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0792837207", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519FHVZB5JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "When Harry Met Sally...

{"description": "Ah, those fun-loving Communists! InNinotchkathree Soviets make their way to Paris to sell off imperial jewels to raise money to buy tractors for the USSR. When Grand Duchess Swana (Ina Claire), former owner of the jewels, discovers what's happening, she deploys her lover Leon (Melvyn Douglas) to recover her gems. He starts a court proceeding while seducing the three bumbling Soviets with the luxuries of capitalistic life. The delay of the sale is noticed in Moscow, and Comrade Ninotchka (Greta Garbo) is dispatched to Paris to settle the matter. Soon after arrival, she meets Leon, who is charmed by her severe, uptight manner and her stunning beauty (\"I love Russians! Comrade, I've been fascinated by your five-year plan for the last 15 years\"), and he sets about wooing her, despite her disbelief in love (it's merely a \"chemical reaction,\" she dourly informs him). Romance, jealousy, and capitalistic frivolity ensue.When this film was released in 1939, it was advertised as \"Garbo laughs,\" as it was her first and only comedy. The film, directed by Ernst Lubitsch, is amusing not only for its story line, but also for its dated look at early Communism (Ninotchka keeps a photo of a stern-looking Lenin by her bedside, although she feels uncomfortable doing so in a room that costs 2,000 francs a night, the price of a cow back home). The satirical image of the young Communist fighting against corrupt Western ways seems somewhat idealistic today but nonetheless provided levity during the shaky political times of the film's release. Viewers may be jarred by the casual \"Heil Hitler\" greeting of a couple at the train station, but overall this film holds up as one of Lubitsch's masterpieces and a lighter glimpse of the mysterious Garbo.--Jenny Brown", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000K0YLZ0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 493885}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.09, "brand": "", "asin": "0792840062", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NRVK2PQTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ninotchka [VHS]"}
{"description": "InThe Bad and the Beautiful, Kirk Douglas plays a tyrannical, manipulative producer fallen on hard times. To get back on his feet, he asks for help from three Hollywood giants whose careers he helped launch--a director (Barry Sullivan), an actress (Lana Turner), and a writer (Dick Powell). Unfortunately, they all hate him. Flashbacks explain why. Douglas had been close to all three at different points in his career: He and the director started out together making B-movies, he gave the wayward actress her first starring role, he turned the novelist into a successful screenwriter.  Then in one way or another he stabbed each of them in the back, though not always deliberately. The script has a lot of backstage  clich&eacute;s, but Vincente Minnelli's sharp, energetic direction, the gorgeous black-and-white  cinematography, and the topnotch performances--particularly Douglas and Gloria Grahame, who won an Oscar for her sweet role as the writer's cheerful Southern wife--flesh out the clich&eacute;s with cutting details and convincing bile. Caustic, starry-eyed, and slyly funny,The Bad and the Beautifulis a strange and skillful blend of \"If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere\" pluck and poisonous cynicism, one of the great movies about making movies.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303391931", "078200847X", "6304628188", "6301491920", "6302000661", "6302227135", "6300183890", "0783215096", "6300183874", "6301968891", "6303364772", "0792839846", "6304508557", "6301969316", "630266232X", "6301564456", "0790743531", "0792845951", "6302375827", "6302278929", "B00000493Q", "0783215517", "630197350X", "0792844564", "6301967410", "079284517X", "6300273202", "6300216012", "6304308418"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 448211}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.93, "brand": "", "asin": "0792840038", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C42P8QFDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Bad and the Beautiful [VHS]"}

{"description": "Pierce Brosnan returns for his second stint as James Bond (afterGoldenEye), and he's doing it in high style with an invigorating cast of costars. It's only appropriate that a Bond film from 1997 would find Agent 007 pitted against a media mogul (Jonathan Pryce) who's going to start a global war (beginning with stolen nuclear missiles aimed at China) to create attention-grabbing headlines for his latest multimedia news channel. It's the information age run amok, and Bond must team up with a lovely and lethal agent from the Chinese External Security Force (played by Honk Kong action star Michelle Yeoh) to foil the madman's plot of global domination. Luckily for Bond, the villain's wife (Teri Hatcher) is one of his former lovers, and at the behest of his superior M (Judi Dench), 007 finds ample opportunity to exploit the connection. Although it bears some nagging similarities to many formulaic action films from the '90s,Tomorrow Never Dies(with a title song performed by Sheryl Crow) boasts enough grand-scale action and sufficiently intelligent plotting to suggest the Bond series has plenty of potential to survive into the next millennium. Armed with the usual array of gadgets (including a remote-controlled BMW), Brosnan settles into his role with acceptable flair, and the dynamic Yeoh provides a perfect balance to the sexism that once threatened to turn Bond into a politically incorrect anachronism.  He's still Bond, to be sure, but he's saving the world with a bit more sophisticated finesse.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304032579", "B00008V2VP", "6305784906", "6304047843", "6302510031", "6302380294", "6302510023", "6302510198", "630251004X", "B000006FNX", "630251018X", "6302510015", "6302380596", "6302510007", "B00AQSN7HE", "B001PPLIEG", "6302380588", "B007REV4T8", "B00004TYS8", "6302824613", "6303651488", "6303651461", "630238060X", "B0000068SI", "B00000JGEI", "6303313345", "B000005QWI"], "bought_together": ["6305784906", "B00008V2VP"], "also_viewed": ["B009NUV0E8", "6304032579", "B001PO6FF4", "B00008V2VP", "B001AQO3TW", "B00AZFECS6", "630251004X", "B007REV4YI", "B001PPLIEG", "6302510007", "B009L6S5EC", "6304047843", "6305784906", "6302510198", "6303651488", "B00AQSN7HE", "630238060X", "B0055OG2BC", "B0030IIZ4M", "630251018X", "6302380294", "6303651461", "B00004TYS8", "6303402348", "B00K7IPGS6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 584838}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.79, "brand": "", "asin": "079283965X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4149PM1DNVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tomorrow Never Dies (Limited Edition Gift Pack) [VHS]"}
{"description": "One of the most rousingly enjoyable sports movies ever made, this small-town drama tells the story of the Hickory Huskers, an underdog basketball team from a tiny Indiana high school that makes it all the way to the state championship tournament. It's a familiar story, but sensitive direction and a splendid screenplay helped make this one of the best films of 1986, highlighted by the superb performances of Gene Hackman as the Huskers' coach, and Oscar nominee Dennis Hopper as the alcoholic father of one of the team's key players. As the drama unfolds we come to realize that many of the characters (including Barbara Hershey as a schoolteacher with whom Hackman falls in love) are recovering from disappointing setbacks, and this depth of character is what makes the otherwise conventional basketball story so richly rewarding. LikeRocky,Rudy,andBreaking Away, this is a quintessentially American movie about beating the odds and rising above one's own limitations. Just try to watch it without cheering!--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004W221", "B000EXZFCQ", "B0001US66Y", "B000056VP4", "B00005JPBO", "B000J3OTT6", "B00AEFXOKO", "B000068NNU", "B000MNOX94", "B001FB55NK", "B0068FZ0GK", "B0009HLD0K", "B00AEFXJY0", "B002VECM6S", "B000R7G6H2", "B00008EY60", "B0012QHUB8", "B004FQX5A2", "0800177258", "B001LGXIA6", "B0013XZ760", "B000X5RBXG", "B002YMWQ2M", "B0060ZJ7BC", "B009NNM9OA", "B00004TJQJ", "B000AP04GK", "B003XNGQPY", "B006TTC5B8", "B0007WFYBG", "B00AEFXHNI", "B00028HBES", "B0002WZTOI", "B00282LB2O", "078324021X", "B004KPLVX6", "B006G89C5O", "B002O3Z4XY", "0783225733", "B0012YYZDG", "B00005M20J", "B004X2TYG2", "B00JPQ1INI", "B00005JNEW", "B0006GAO5Y", "B000CNFC76", "B0010YSD90", "B004DK5CW4", "B000Q7ZNZ4", "B004FQX5C0", "B00DNF1SSC", "B00AEFXXMI", "B000ARTN3I", "B0006FYOTC", "B000FOPPDI", "B00AATUZLU", "B00006SFL7", "B000P0J09W", "B000KHYN9C", "B000Z8GZYW", "B00AOO46BQ", "B000068QPY", "B00009AOAW", "B002JCSWV6", "B000A50442", "6305428387", "B000BNTMFK", "B00E1HIXFW", "B000ND91WC", "6305428352", "B0013XZ76K", "1452891222", "B003VE9WTW", "B00AEFY0F2", "B0000WN13Q", "B00004Y2R1", "B0036APHRC", "B002NZK5UK", "B000BFH2C8", "B00004RFHN", "B00008N6NQ", "B004GJYROG"], "bought_together": ["B00004W221", "B000056VP4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004W221", "B000056VP4", "B000EXZFCQ", "B00AEFXOKO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5284}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.19, "brand": "Team Marketing", "asin": "0792843592", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51oeWMjLPGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hoosiers"}

{"description": "Mike Myers's first feature role without hisWayne's Worldwig is a performance at odds with the best interests of the movie. Myers plays a single guy who always manages to find something seriously wrong with each of his girlfriends. His new love (Nancy Travis), a butcher, may be the perfect woman, except for one thing: she might be a \"black-widow\" killer who prefers dispatching husbands with a sharp instrument. Robbie Fox's original script has a fine shape and strong, black-comedy material within it. But Myers creates unnecessary dissonance by playing a variety of characters (including an irascible Scotsman like the one he often played onSaturday Night Live) and accenting his skills as an improvisational comic (such as impersonating the soothing cadences of a massage therapist). It's not that Myers isn't funny doing all that, but it has nothing to do with the movie.

{"description": "Bill Murray does warmth in his most consistently effective post-Stripescomedy, a romantic fantasy about a wacky weatherman forced to relive one strange day over and over again, until he gets it right. Snowed in during a road-trip expedition to watch the famous groundhog encounter his shadow, Murray falls into a time warp that is never explained but pays off so richly that it doesn't need to be. The elaborate loop-the-loop plot structure cooked up by screenwriter Danny Rubin is crystal-clear every step of the way, but it's Murray's world-class reactive timing that makes the jokes explode, and we end up looking forward to each new variation. He squeezes all the available juice out of every scene. Without forcing the issue, he makes us understand why this fly-away personality responds so intensely to the radiant sanity of the TV producer played by Andie MacDowell. The blissfully clueless Chris Elliott (Cabin Boy) is Murray's nudnik cameraman.--David Chute", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004RJ73", "B00287Z18Y", "6305609764", "B00005PJ6O", "B007P9HW3M", "0790740044", "B00AEFXXMI", "0783227388", "6305236569", "B00000IQBW", "B000E33W1W", "0804141444", "B0009RCPY8", "B0019HQICW", "B001AGXEAG", "B00AEFXDO6", "0767818105", "0792844890", "B002O3Z4YI", "B0000A14TA", "B0014Z4OMU", "B000K7VHTQ", "B00AEBBA2M", "B00005Y71F", "B00AEBB9SM", "B002GOAGZC", "B000G6BLW4", "B001IHJ988", "B00008G8LM", "B001LXIDVI", "B000QQLVPQ", "B005LL817W", "B001LMAK9W", "B00AEBB9DM", "0767806808", "B008R65XKQ", "B000G6BLWE", "B00003CXC3", "B00005O5CM", "B000065V3P", "B00005JM4Q", "B00AEBB9E6", "B000ELJAEM", "B00AEFYS2M", "B00AEFY0F2", "0767836324", "B002T51X4Q", "0800195175", "B0009X760U", "B000A3XYIM", "B000VBIGD6", "B000069HYF", "B00003CXR4", "0790742071", "B00AEFY3MC", "B000PHVZNE", "B0000YTP02", "B000E6ESI0", "B000YDBPAM", "B007Y1NR1W", "B00158K0QU", "B00006FMUW", "B00BLN4UPG", "B00AEFYM2S", "B000HT3PPG", "B000056HEA", "B000068NNU", "B0045HCJ7G", "B000V4UFZK", "B004GJYRA0", "B004AOECXI", "B000YAF4MA", "B00AEFXPG2", "B0045HCIY0"], "bought_together": ["B00004RJ73", "B00287Z18Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004RJ73", "B00005PJ6O", "B000E33W1W", "B00287Z18Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 107101}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.42, "brand": "", "asin": "080017948X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21XPDM6RK1L.jpg", "title": "Groundhog Day"}

{"description": "Marlon Brando's famous \"I coulda been a contenda\" speech is such a warhorse by now that a lot of people probably feel they've seen this picture already, even if they haven't. And many of those who have seen it may have forgotten how flat-out thrilling it is. For all its great dramatic and cinematic qualities, and its fiery social criticism, Elia Kazan'sOn the Waterfrontis also one of the most gripping melodramas of political corruption and individual heroism ever made in the United States, a five-star gut-grabber. Shot on location around the docks of Hoboken, New Jersey, in the mid-1950s, it tells the fact-based story of a longshoreman (Brando's Terry Malloy) who is blackballed and savagely beaten for informing against the mobsters who have taken over his union and sold it out to the bosses. (Karl Malden has a more conventional stalwart-hero role, as an idealistic priest who nurtures Terry's pangs of conscience.) Lee J. Cobb, who created the role of Willy Loman inDeath of Salesmanunder Kazan's direction on Broadway, makes a formidable foe as a greedy union leader.--David Chute", "related": {"also_bought": ["1558807780", "6304039506", "6302824605", "B001KXZGO6", "6300214044", "0792837096", "6300215644", "6301586042", "0790733935", "0800100832", "6301976983", "0790743213", "0790734079", "0790743531", "6304119046", "B00AEFXN9G", "0782008348", "1569942072", "6302226899", "B00000J2KZ", "630442972X", "B00000FZCU", "6301773586", "B000BWIZRW", "6302360978", "B000006N70", "0792837967", "B000007PI4", "630018627X", "6301628616", "6302158176", "630021639X", "6301968948", "0780018664", "079284517X", "6301969405", "B001BZQMFA", "6302120624", "6304457316", "6304196873", "0792107683", "6303039405", "0783204914", "B003MG6FJY", "6301969294", "0792837630", "B00000GJ2B", "6300214567", "0790743159", "6300181278", "6302797535", "6301797957", "6300268470", "6301025083", "B000054OW2", "0783235607", "6301978692", "6302640504", "6301670140", "B000F3FTIA", "0792841026", "0792841859", "0792838556", "6304212151", "630347327X", "1558808590", "B000056BRF", "630196912X", "0800116917", "6300215938", "B0001E7LQG", "6302305950"], "bought_together": ["6304039506"], "also_viewed": ["0800116917", "6301797906", "6301976983", "6305123616", "0783216084", "6304429274", "1558807780", "0792839846", "0792837096"]}, "price": 25.97, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 530428}, "asin": "080018520X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZRDG09WEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "On the Waterfront (includes Oscar's Greatest Moments 1971-1991) [VHS]"}
{"description": "This didn't turn out to be quite the deserving American vehicle for Hong Kong action superstar Chow Yun-fat that it should have been. But it is an entertaining potboiler about a hired gun (Chow) who fails to carry out an assignment to kill a cop (which would leave the fellow's son without a father), and becomes a target himself when the contract is handed over to other assassins. Mira Sorvino plays a document forger who is drawn into the fray, pairing up with the hero as they fight their way out of bad spots. The whole enterprise is a little too routine, but the action is sharp and the battles are imaginative and crisp.

{"description": "Director Billy Wilder (Sunset Boulevard) and writer Raymond Chandler (The Big Sleep) adapted James M. Cain's hard-boiled novel into this wildly thrilling story of insurance man Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), who schemes the perfect murder with the beautiful dame Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck): kill Dietrichson's husband and make off with the insurance money. But, of course, in these plots things never quite go as planned, and Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) is the wily insurance investigator who must sort things out. From the opening scene you know Neff is doomed, as the story is told in flashback; yet, to the film's credit, this doesn't diminish any of the tension of the movie. This early film noir flick is wonderfully campy by today's standards, and the dialogue is snappy (\"I thought you were smarter than the rest, Walter. But I was wrong. You're not smarter, just a little taller\"), filled with lots of \"dame\"s and \"baby\"s. Stanwyck is the ultimate femme fatale, and MacMurray, despite a career largely defined by roles as a softy (notably in the TV seriesMy Three Sonsand the movieThe Shaggy Dog), is convincingly cast against type as the hapless, love-struck sap.--Jenny Brown", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300215644", "0783236352", "6304039530", "6303402070", "6301975987", "6302226899", "6301973410", "6300215512", "6300183580", "6300183513", "6304457316", "B001D8W7EK", "6301640667", "6304359705", "6302909023", "6305999872", "B000003KE0", "0783221347", "6304429274", "0792837096", "6301797906", "630197350X", "0769403468", "B00AEFXN9G", "6301797957", "B00023P4FQ", "6304039506", "0790743213", "B001D8W7F4", "6305123616", "0783217390", "6302360978", "6302041090", "0800100832", "B000EVD38G", "6301773586", "0792839846", "B001D8W7EU", "B00008LDNZ", "6304119046", "6301798503", "0782008348", "630196697X", "6301969316", "6305012792", "0783235674", "B000AV4RQ2", "0792841409", "6301966430", "6300181421", "6301973232", "6301973259", "6302413400", "0792110269", "6303057225", "6302413435", "B001BZQMFA", "0800113055", "6300181405", "B000GX7MMA", "B000M7BEPQ", "6304111363", "6302227135", "6303396623", "6304039522", "1569942072", "B0045HCJ9E", "6302484383", "6302238331", "6300215741", "6301978536", "B00004TYS8", "6302700949", "0783217528", "0783235607", "6301586042", "6301976061", "B0047M6Y66", "0792841026", "6301800974", "6301798708", "0792837967", "6301798732", "6300181367", "B00005Q4GZ", "630266232X", "B0000040EO", "0790734079", "6302725542", "6300269310", "0783235682", "6301963911", "6301798562", "6301969049", "0792108280", "6300251012", "6302801133", "1558804226", "0792101448", "0764007440"], "bought_together": ["0783236352"], "also_viewed": ["B00I3C1T1Q", "6301797906", "6304429274", "6305123616", "B000005PPB", "B0050FXDDQ", "0800116917", "6301976983", "6304117752", "0783216084", "6303402070", "0792837096", "6304039522", "6301964012", "0792839846", "B009YX8MSG", "B00GST8UB8", "B00JAQJMJ0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 171937}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.0, "brand": "", "asin": "1558807780", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5164XM9AE3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Double Indemnity [VHS]"}

{"description": "Alain Delon is the coolest killer to hit the screen, a film noir loner for the modern era, in Jean-Pierre Melville's austere 1967 French crime classic. Delon's impassive hit man, Jef Costello, is the ultimate professional in an alienated world of glass and metal. On his latest contract, however, he lets a witness live--a charming jazz pianist, Valerie (Cathy Rosier), who neglects to identify him in the police lineup. When Costello survives an assassination attempt by his employers, he carefully plots his next moves as cops and criminals close in and he prepares for one last job. Melville meticulously details every move by Costello and the police in fascinating wordless sequences, from Costello's preparations for his first hit to the cops' exhaustive efforts to tail Jef as he lines up his last; and his measured pace creates an otherworldly ambiance, an uneasy calm on the verge of shattering. Costello remains a cipher, a zen killer whose fa&ccedil;ade begins to crack as the world seems to be collapsing in on him, exposing the wound-up psyche hidden behind his blank face. Melville rethinks film noir in modern terms, as an existential crime drama in soft, somber color and sleek images (courtesy of cinematographer extraordinaire Henri Deca&euml;).Le Samoura&iuml;inspired two pseudo-remakes, Walter Hill'sDriverand John Woo'sKiller, but neither film comes close to the compelling austerity and meticulous detail of Melville's cult masterpiece.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302797683"]}, "price": 15.5, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 469788}, "asin": "1567301347", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AF1DKN13L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Le Samourai [VHS]"}
{"description": "Outside of devoted cult audiences, many Americans have yet to discover the extremely stylish, relentlessly terrifying Italian horror genre, or the films of its talented virtuoso, Dario Argento.Suspiria, part one of a still-uncompleted trilogy (the luminously emptyInfernowas the second), is considered his masterpiece by Argento devotees but also doubles as a perfect starting point for those unfamiliar with the director or his genre. The convoluted plot follows an American dancer (Jessica Harper) from her arrival at a European ballet school to her discovery that it's actually a witches coven; but, really, don't worry about that too much. Argento makes narrative subservient to technique, preferring instead to assault the senses and nervous system with mood, atmosphere, illusory gore, garish set production, a menacing camera, and perhaps the creepiest score ever created for a movie. It's essentially a series of effectively unsettling set pieces--a raging storm that Harper should have taken for an omen, and a blind man attacked by his own dog are just two examples--strung together on a skeleton structure.

Unbeknownst to these folks, the duchess who willed the castle to Reilly kept her kid shackled in the dungeon, lambasting him regularly with a wicked cat-o'-nine-tails.  Though the duchess is gone, the eponymous freak remains, now fully grown.  As the family moves into the castle to await its sale, internal conflicts concerning Reilly's guilt over the blinding of the daughter, and the blame from his wife, further fracture their unstable family unit.  Castle Freak escapes his shackles in search of food, and more importantly human warmth.  The Freak just doesn't know how to express his need for love in a socially acceptable way, however, and seems destined for an unsavory end at the hands of the something-to-prove Reilly, who must find some way to route to vicious creature.

{"description": "Over 10 years after first turning down the role, Bela Lugosi donned the neck bolts and platform boots to play Frankenstein's monster for the first and only time inFrankenstein Meets the Wolfman. Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr., reprising his most famous role), killed at the end ofThe Wolf Man, is inexplicably alive and searching for the brilliant Dr. Frankenstein but instead finds the Monster, frozen in ice beneath the castle, and an ambitious scientist (Patric Knowles) who revives the creature and promises to cure Larry. Lugosi is lurching and clumsy as the Monster, while Chaney is appropriately tortured as Larry but stiff and snarly as the Wolf Man, more man than wolf. Last-minute cuts by the studio renders much of the film incomprehensible: the monster was left blind and vocal at the end ofGhost of Frankenstein, but all references to either were deleted (which partly accounts for Lugosi's performance) and he's now sighted but mute. Roy William Neill, a talented B-movie director best known for his Sherlock Holmes films with Basil Rathbone, can't do much with the perfunctory script, but he does deliver a highly entertaining conclusion: the Wolf Man battles the Monster while a spectacular disaster (accomplished with obvious but charming models) wipes the castle off the face of the earth... at least untilHouse of Frankensteinthe next year.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302526167", "6300183084", "630252542X", "6302843219", "6302841771", "6300181278", "6300183092", "6300181286", "6302841763", "6300183629", "6301257014", "6302843227", "630284178X", "6301005783", "6302120101", "6302526175", "630018529X", "6302841844", "6300185281", "6302526094", "B00005LC4K", "6302843197", "6300181820", "6302526051", "6302491975", "6302841798", "6300215520", "B00000AEW0", "6302884713", "5554306004", "1564427099", "630315851X", "0783228090", "6304680236", "6303158579", "0790731223", "6304507348", "6302763916"], "bought_together": ["6302526167", "6300183092"], "also_viewed": ["B00005LC4K", "6300183084", "6300183092", "6302526167", "B006TTC5J0", "6300181286", "6302841763", "B00001TZ6Q", "6302841771", "B0001CNRNE", "6302843227", "B00000JMOF", "6302843219", "6300181278", "B00000K14A", "6302120101", "6300181820", "6300183629", "6300185281", "B008FL8OTK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 320356}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6300185443", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YQ5KXVNPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman [VHS]"}
{"description": "Like the Greenwich Village courtyard view from its titular portal, Alfred Hitchcock's classicRear Windowis both confined and multileveled: both its story and visual perspective are dictated by its protagonist's imprisonment in his apartment, convalescing in a wheelchair, from which both he and the audience observe the lives of his neighbors. Cheerful voyeurism, as well as the behavior glimpsed among the various tenants, affords a droll comic atmosphere that gradually darkens when he sees clues to what may be a murder.Photographer L.B. \"Jeff\" Jeffries (James Stewart) is, in fact, a voyeur by trade, a professional photographer sidelined by an accident while on assignment. His immersion in the human drama (and comedy) visible from his window is a by-product of boredom, underlined by the disapproval of his girlfriend, Lisa (Grace Kelly), and a wisecracking visiting nurse (Thelma Ritter). Yet when the invalid wife of Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr) disappears, Jeff enlists the two women to help him to determine whether she's really left town, as Thorwald insists, or been murdered.Hitchcock scholar Donald Spoto convincingly argues that the crime at the center of this mystery is the MacGuffin--a mere pretext--in a film that's more interested in the implications of Jeff's sentinel perspective. We actually learn more about the lives of the other neighbors (given generic names by Jeff, even as he's drawn into their lives) he, and we, watch undetected than we do the putative murderer and his victim. Jeff's evident fear of intimacy and commitment with the elegant, adoring Lisa provides the other vital thread to the script, one woven not only into the couple's own relationship, but reflected and even commented upon through the various neighbors' lives.At minimum, Hitchcock's skill at making us accomplices to Jeff's spying, coupled with an ingenious escalation of suspense as the teasingly vague evidence coalesces into ominous proof, deliver a superb thriller spiked with droll humor, right up to its nail-biting, nightmarish climax. At deeper levels, however,Rear Windowplumbs issues of moral responsibility and emotional honesty, while offering further proof (were any needed) of the director's brilliance as a visual storyteller.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790743213", "0783221347", "6304039530", "6300181340", "0783235593", "6300183580", "6300215741", "6301798503", "0783235607", "6305123616", "0792839846", "0783222955", "B0002IXSVI", "630150528X", "6301647734", "6304429274", "B0000040EO", "6302797667", "1558807780", "0783235704", "0792837614", "0783236352", "0783235623", "6301734734", "0790743159", "6305576173", "6304359705", "0783235682", "B00005A06N", "6304119097", "630266232X", "6301964012", "6300181529", "630233683X", "6301670159", "B00000F13T", "6301977084", "6301976061", "0792837649", "6303494390", "0782008348", "6300215512", "6305282927", "B00001OWYM", "B00005N5S2", "6303215734", "6300215717", "B000005PPB", "0783235674", "6305012792", "6304196954", "0800132009", "6302241103", "0792841859", "6304071876", "6302909023", "B00AEFXD1O", "B00000F3QZ", "6301607929", "6301978110", "B0087ZG7PW", "6300267865", "0800113055", "B000006N70", "B0045HCJ9E", "0782006809", "B00007JME0", "0780614097", "6301670140", "0792110269", "B000021Y6M", "6300269477", "0783235615", "6302413435", "6301798740", "0792837096", "6303854311", "B00005Q4GY", "0792107683", "0792837630", "6302800897", "6304457316", "0792835573", "6301978552", "B00000JKNL", "6303637574", "6305222754", "6302360978", "B00000JZIH", "6301797957", "6301975987", "1558800034", "6304359675", "6300271781", "630197350X", "6303364772", "6300216365", "6301800974", "0783227264"], "bought_together": ["0783221347", "6300183580"], "also_viewed": ["B0087ZG7PW", "B0045HCJ9E", "B0002HOEQ2", "B002GSXKQA", "B000A1INJE", "B000055Y0X", "B0087ZG7UW", "B001D8W7EU", "B00KMAVPW0", "B00J2R3VZI", "B008D1Q1VU", "B0045HCJHG", "B006FE83UE", "B00AEBB89C", "B003LMPKSQ", "B0045HCJQW", "B007N5YJWK", "0792839846", "B0002HOERG", "0790743213", "B000CCW2TS", "B000LP6KNU", "B000ECX0S8", "6304119046", "B00004XPPC", "B0010YSD7W", "B00AEBB97S", "B001D8W7EK", "B000ECX0O2", "6304429274", "B00I3C1T34", "6304039530", "630266232X", "0800132009", "6304039522", "B003VS0CX8", "0783235593", "B002VWNIAY", "6300183211", "B00BWJQEC6", "B0087F7VSY", "B002VWNIDG", "B00CNW9ZI6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 203666}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.18, "brand": "", "asin": "6300183513", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518BC0WC70L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rear Window [VHS]"}
{"description": "The debut film of director Joel Coen and his brother-producer Ethan Coen, 1983'sBlood Simpleis grisly comic noir that marries the feverish toughness of pulp thrillers with the ghoulishness of even pulpier horror. (Imagine the novels of Jim Thompson somehow fused with the comic tabloidWeird Tales, and you get the idea.) The story concerns a Texas bar owner (Dan Hedaya) who hires a seedy private detective (M. Emmett Walsh) to follow his cheating wife (Frances McDormand in her first film appearance), and then kill her and her lover (John Getz). The gumshoe turns the tables on his client, and suddenly a bad situation gets much, much worse, with some violent goings-on that are as elemental as they are shocking. (A scene in which a character who has been buried alive suddenly emerges from his own grave instantly becomes an archetypal nightmare.) Shot by Barry Sonnenfeld before he became an A-list director in Hollywood,Blood Simpleestablished the hyperreal look and feel of the Coens' productions (undoubtedly inspired a bit by filmmaker Sam Raimi, whoseThe Evil Deadhad just been coedited by Joel). Sections of the film have proved to be an endurance test for art-house movie fans, particularly an extended climax that involves one shock after another but ends with a laugh at the absurdity of criminal ambition. This is definitely one of the triumphs of the 1980s and the American independent film scene in general.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003UESJME", "6300184064", "630347327X", "B00000J2KZ", "6302641888"], "also_viewed": ["B00553K8FY", "6304297564", "6305417806"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 358611}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.3, "brand": "", "asin": "6300184110", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JN74WN7BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blood Simple [VHS]"}
{"description": "As bad asFriday the 13th, Part 2is, it's a work of art in comparison to the rest of theFriday the 13thflicks that came afterward. This installment officially introduced us to Jason Voorhees as the killer (if you remember Drew Barrymore's fatal phone quiz inScream, you know that the killer in the firstFriday the 13thwas actually Jason's mother), and made the slicing and dicing even more generic. Survivor Alice is dispatched within the first 10 minutes, and we're left with plucky Ginny (Amy Steel, doing a fairly decent Jamie Lee Curtis impression) to do battle with the monstrous Jason. Ginny's part of a another group of horny teenagers (less intelligent as well as less attractive than their predecessors) who try to resurrect Camp Crystal Lake five years after the initial murders--a pretty mean feat, considering this movie was made only a year after the first one. Being a smarty-pants child-psychology major, Ginny tries to outwit the dim Jason, and at one point dons the bloody and moldy sweater of Jason's late mother (which is more disgusting than any of the killings beforehand) in an attempt to confuse the masked killer. Jason may not be the brightest bulb on the tree, but the only one who's going to pull the wool--or in this case, the burlap--over his eyes is Jason himself, who wears a sack with one eyehole throughout the movie to hide his deformed features (he finally found his way to a sporting-goods store and his trademark hockey mask appears in the third installment of the series).

Joe Gillis (William Holden), a broke and cynical young screenwriter, is attempting to ditch a pair of repo men late one afternoon when he pulls off L.A.'s storied Sunset Boulevard and into the driveway of a seedy mansion belonging to Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), a forgotten silent movie luminary whose brilliant acting career withered with the coming of talkies. The demented old movie queen lives in the past, assisted by her devoted (but intimidating) butler, Max (played by Erich von Stroheim, the legendary director ofGreedand Swanson's own lost epic,Queen Kelly). Norma dreams of making a comeback in a remake ofSalometo be directed by her old colleague Cecil B.

{"description": "In the tradition of such obsessively driven directors as Erich von Stroheim and Werner Herzog, Francis Ford Coppola approached the production ofApocalypse Nowas if it were his own epic mission into the heart of darkness. On location in the storm-ravaged Philippines, he quite literally went mad as the project threatened to devour him in a vortex of creative despair, but from this insanity came one of the greatest films ever made. It began as a John Milius screenplay, transposing Joseph Conrad's classic story \"Heart of Darkness\" into the horrors of the Vietnam War, following a battle-weary Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) on a secret upriver mission to find and execute the renegade Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has reverted to a state of murderous and mystical insanity. The journey is fraught with danger involving wartime action on epic and intimate scales. One measure of the film's awesome visceral impact is the number of sequences, images, and lines of dialogue that have literally burned themselves into our cinematic consciousness, from the Wagnerian strike of helicopter gunships on a Vietnamese village to the brutal murder of stowaways on a peasant sampan and the unflinching fearlessness of the surfing warrior Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who speaks lovingly of \"the smell of napalm in the morning.\" Like Herzog'sAguirre: The Wrath of God, this film is the product of genius cast into a pit of hell and emerging, phoenix-like, in triumph. Coppola's obsession (effectively detailed in the riveting documentaryHearts of Darkness, directed by Coppola's wife, Eleanor) informs every scene and every frame, and the result is a film for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301115430", "630018627X", "0790701251", "6300183211", "6303686796", "6305363668", "079284646X", "6304935811", "0784011923", "6303953425", "0792836510", "6302822688", "B000003KHS", "630021639X", "6304119046", "B00003CXE6", "6302610702", "0792158261", "B000K7VHQE", "6303036570", "6303020089", "6303651488", "0800125762", "B004LWZW9W", "B00000JGEI", "0790705141", "6302360978", "6302415853", "0783107986", "B00005ATQA", "630336568X", "0790731975", "6305095566", "6300216500", "6301662954", "6302921058", "6300246965", "6300182878", "0800100832", "B00005JKEC", "6304286961", "B000062XM6", "0784011575", "630197154X", "B00004TYS8", "B00004WIDB", "6304414099", "0800116917", "6302517036", "0800199421", "6304259131", "0783202253", "6303109950", "6303313345", "B00006C7G9", "0792837312", "6302482712", "6300213986", "6303421563", "6304039549", "B000065U6Q", "B0000A36J1", "6300182770", "B00004CNR5", "6304025831", "6303422020", "0790748169", "0800132009"], "bought_together": ["6301115430", "0790701251"], "also_viewed": ["6303953425", "6305363668", "6305750750", "B00000J2KZ", "6303506291", "6303314015"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 172447}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6300214826", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EFVS37MRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Apocalypse Now [VHS]"}

{"description": "In these days when the natural wonders of the world can be so easily synthesized on film by computers, it's a little tough to look upon studio sets of mountain exteriors as anything but unsatisfactory. But that's the situation with Edward Dmytryk's 1956 dramaThe Mountain, starring Spencer Tracy as a retired mountain guide who accompanies his brash young brother (Robert Wagner) on the ascent of a rugged slope to the site of a plane crash. Essentially, Tracy goes along to keep his venal sibling from getting killed, but once at the crash location his attention shifts toward helping a Hindu survivor (Anna Kashfi) reach safety.

The strains and dangers of the climb up and down perfectly mirror the tense dynamics between the two men, and on this score Dmytryk (The Caine Mutiny) does a splendid job.

{"description": "Just as Roberto Benigni found himself on the receiving end of some finger-wagging for making a comedy set during the Holocaust, so the great Ernst Lubitsch caught some heat for this extraordinary 1942 satire set behind enemy lines during World War II. In his best performance on film, Jack Benny stars as Joseph Tura, the lead actor and head of a Polish theater troupe that is suddenly enlisted as a Resistance organization when an American pilot (Robert Stack) requires protection. The twist is that the pilot has been having a series of trysts with Tura's wife (Carole Lombard), the hilarious evidence being the disruptive departure of Stack's character from a theater audience each night as the hammy Tura unknowingly cues the lovers by launching into Hamlet's famous soliloquy. The remarkable script by Edwin Justus Mayer ingeniously folds the tensions of a betrayed marriage into the comic suspense surrounding Tura and company's efforts to pull off aMission: Impossible-like sting on the local Nazi command. Many unforgettable moments and lines of dialogue adorn this black comedy, and the performances--most memorably Sig Ruman's crisp volleys with Benny--are a dream. Above it all, however, is Lubitsch's unmistakable Continentalism, his accent on Old World manners especially in a dangerous situation, suggesting the Nazis' very vulgarity was a reflection of their profound evil.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302226899"], "also_viewed": ["B00CUKTGSA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 308722}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.0, "brand": "", "asin": "630170648X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ER4GRW8WL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "To Be Or Not to Be [VHS]"}
{"description": "This 1963 extravaganza, directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, is certainly an epic historical drama with all the elements: elaborate sets, intricate costuming, name actors, a factual basis, and an overlong script (just over four hours). But the acting is well performed and the backdrops are lush, making this a film worth seeing. Elizabeth Taylor is Cleopatra, the Egyptian queen who seduces Julius Caesar (Rex Harrison) in a political move to hold onto her empire. When Caesar is killed in the Roman Senate, Cleopatra looks to Marc Antony (Richard Burton) for his support, practically enslaving him with her wiles. Taylor is dramatic in her role, at times overly serious, but stunning nonetheless as the woman described as \"well versed in the natural sciences and mathematics. She speaks seven languages proficiently. Were she not a woman one would consider her to be an intellectual.\" While the film does seem to drag at moments, it deserves the four Oscars it won for cinematography, art direction-set direction, costumes, and special effects.

Stephen Boyd stars as a colorless commander sent to keep an eye on things  (though his eyes stay mostly on shapely medical assistant Raquel Welch), while  Donald Pleasance is suitably twitchy as the claustrophobic medical consultant.  The science is shaky at best, but the imaginative spectacle is marvelous:  scuba-diving surgeons battle white blood cells, tap the lungs to replenish the oxygen  supply, and shoot the aorta like daredevil surfers. The film took home a  well-deserved Oscar for Best Visual Effects. Director Richard Fleischer, who turned  Disney's 195420,000 Leagues Under the Seainto one of the most riveting  submarine adventures of all time, creates a picture so taut with cold-war  tensions and cloak-and-dagger secrecy that niggling scientific contradictions  (such as, how do miniaturized humans breathe full-sized air molecules?) seem  moot.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302098424", "6300215539", "B00007JMD8", "B00005JKFR", "6303148352", "6301977742", "6304291698", "6300181537", "6304143184", "0767825411", "B007HO39HI"], "bought_together": ["6302098424", "6304291698"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 306694}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.97, "brand": "", "asin": "6301744160", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HPSKKX8DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fantastic Voyage [VHS]"}

{"description": "A flawed but stylish adaptation of the Chester Gould comic strip by director Warren Beatty, who also stars in the title role. The minimalist plot involves a battalion of baddies who confront the intrepid detective in a series of strung-together vignettes. Al Pacino is a comedic if overblown standout as Big Boy Caprice, and Madonna simply smolders as aggressive blonde bombshell Breathless Mahoney. It matters not that the plot is Spartan, as this dazzling eye candy is much enhanced by Stephen Sondheim's songs, including the Academy Award-winning ditty, \"Sooner or Later (I Always Get My Man).\" Beatty took his cue from the source material and concentrated on the relationships between these people, whether strained, romantic, or hateful. The performances are subtle and more amusing than you would expect from such a visually bold picture. Shot in bright, primary colors, this also won Oscars for Best Art/Set Direction and Makeup (for those inventively hideous criminals).

Making matters worse, Tom has outstanding gambling debts he can't pay, which keeps him in regular touch with a punishing enforcer.

{"description": "The Anthony Mann-Jimmy Stewart Westerns in the 1950s infused the genre with a psychological intensity and psychopathic edge. The brutalThe Naked Spur, their third collaboration, is generally considered their best work together and one of the finest Westerns ever made. Stewart is a hard, angry bounty hunter tracking outlaw Robert Ryan in this lean five-character drama set in a deceptively beautiful mountain wilderness. Stewart finds himself saddled with two unwanted partners, sourdough prospector Millard Mitchell (his sidekick in the earlier Mann WesternWinchester '73) and dishonorably discharged cavalry officer Ralph Meeker. Ryan's tomboyish sidekick Janet Leigh becomes increasingly torn between duty to her desperate guardian and her growing attraction to Stewart. The rugged landscape of jutting peaks, narrow passes, and torrential rivers is as gorgeous as it is dangerous: a well-protected plateau becomes a sniper's perch, an old mine turns from protective cave to dangerous cave-in. Stewart delivers the most ruthless performance of his career as a man haunted by betrayal, unwilling to trust and unable to love. Ryan's jovial banter and charm masks a cold-blooded savagery (he once remarked that it's his favorite performance). The tension stretches to the breaking point in this taut battle of wits, which culminates in a standoff next to the white water of a raging river, where Mann brilliantly uses the jagged landscape as a deadly battleground--nature itself becomes an enemy.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300184951", "6302177448", "6301977297", "0792837371", "6304359675", "6302450179", "6303072747", "0792110463", "6302177421", "0783217528", "6301798600", "630442972X", "6300184935", "6302308208", "630197705X", "6301973240", "6300268594", "6302842263", "0792838548", "6301971876", "6304119038", "6302873150", "630197719X", "6304457316", "6301798708", "6303333079", "0792837339", "630150528X"], "bought_together": ["6300184951", "6302177448"], "also_viewed": ["6302177448"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 229415}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.93, "brand": "", "asin": "6302032237", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21F2QAKVQ3L.jpg", "title": "Naked Spur [VHS]"}

{"description": "Now and forever a favorite among kids, this 1990 comedy written by John Hughes (The Breakfast Club) and directed by Chris Columbus (Mrs. Doubtfire) ushered Macaulay Culkin onto the screen as a troubled 8-year-old who doesn't comfortably mesh with his large family. He's forced to grow a little after being accidentally left behind when his folks and siblings fly off to Paris. A good-looking boy, Culkin lights up the screen during several funny sequences, the most famous of which finds him screaming for joy when he realizes he's unsupervised in his own house. A bit wooden with dialogue, the then-little star's voice could grate on the nerves (especially in long, wise-child passages of pure bromide), but he unquestionably carries the film. Billie Bird and John Candy show up as two of the interesting strangers Culkin's character meets. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are entertainingly cartoonish as thieves, but the ensuing violence once the little hero decides to keep them out of his house is over-the-top.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302765536", "6304932553", "B0000A02WC", "0767825411", "6300214753", "6303314015", "079070546X", "B00000490M", "B0000048S1", "6303049079", "6303506291", "B00000JKNP", "630442972X", "6300269639", "6302824729", "6301570723", "0784011923", "6304117752", "6303442447", "B00005JKDQ", "B0000AQZYM", "6302914469", "B00005B6ND", "6300263673", "6304089767", "0788812408", "6300183181", "6303344224", "B00000JGEI", "6305814694", "6301792734", "0783216084", "0790731436", "6303148352", "6302787068", "6304209266", "6303215734", "630018403X", "6300213668", "B00005LOUS", "B0002F6BQU", "6304500831", "B00006G8LB", "6301969707", "B000641D2Y", "6303269966", "6304030959", "630179513X", "6302705517", "0790742322", "6302794331", "B000059XY5", "078881172X", "6303338690", "155890641X", "6302526574", "6303446590", "6303540082", "6301827732", "6302374189", "6303236863", "0800196767", "6301569385", "B00008X5J8", "6302968143", "6300215814", "B00000JS61", "6301966988", "B00003CX7L", "6304416415", "6302178924", "B000MUANT6", "080013558X", "B0000BWVBD", "B00008DZ83", "6302518393", "B000TJBN6W", "6304118937", "6300183467", "6304291698", "6302453356", "6300214370", "6300214710", "6303168957", "0793941520", "B00000F8J1", "6303109918", "6303929680", "0792133153", "B00023BLXA", "6304093381", "B000005PFL", "B000R3KOWE", "6302409365", "6303347657", "6305537798", "6303212263", "B00000GUNY", "0780623711"], "bought_together": ["6302765536", "6304932553"], "also_viewed": ["0767825411", "6302765536", "6304932553", "0788812408", "B00006CXK5", "6302426200", "6303212379", "6303314015", "6302453356", "B001DDBD5E", "6301404440", "B0007KTBIU", "6301792734", "6304117752", "6302787068", "6302968143", "079070546X", "B000A468XY", "B00003CX8I", "6302526574", "6302320402", "0788805533", "B00003CXI0", "6305940932", "B0000A02WC", "0788805843", "6303148352", "6304500831", "B00005JKDQ", "6305750750", "6304401132", "6304400551", "6302921228", "B00005JL95", "0307142450", "6303315305", "6303442447", "6304501153", "B000009CTR", "0800125789", "0783216084", "6303212395", "0784011923", "6304089767", "6302481805", "B0000AK7AB", "0790700506", "6304873441", "6304143184", "630339406X", "B0000AQZYM", "6305326940", "B000035Z2S", "B0000524CZ", "0788802194", "B00005LOUS", "B00005B238", "6303036813", "6304434340"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 209060}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.87, "brand": "FOX Video", "asin": "6302091632", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GTF7T3ZPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Home Alone [VHS]"}

Fink thinks the job is beneath him, but his desire for acceptance gets the better of him, and he suddenly finds himself holed up in a fleabag hotel in Los Angeles, where he is almost immediately afflicted with writer's block. Various distractions begin to enter his life, first in the form of a famous southern writer (John Mahoney) whom Fink idolizes, and then his neighbor in the hotel, a seemingly amiable salesman played by John Goodman (Sea of Love,Raising Arizona). The writer turns out to be a self-loathing drunk whose secretary (Judy Davis) is the one actually doing the writing. And the neighbor, the working-class hero who Fink made his reputation writing about, may have a horrifying secret of his own.

{"description": "British thespian and sophomore director Kenneth Branagh follows up his adaptation of Shakespeare'sHenry Vwith this abrupt change of pace, a slick, stylish thriller evocative of Hitchcock, classic film noir, and gothic shockers. Sporting an exaggerated American accent, Branagh stars as L.A. private eye Mike Church, a hard-boiled but softhearted detective who takes on the case of a mysterious amnesiac (Branagh's then-real-life wife, Emma Thompson). With the help of an offbeat furniture dealer and part-time hypnotist (Derek Jacobi), Grace (as Mike has named her) dredges up her hidden memories. Little do they realize that her recollections are of a past life in L.A.'s recent history, and as she recounts the details of a famous marriage that ended with a notorious murder (played out as black-and-white flashbacks starring Branagh and Thompson), events of the present begin to mirror the past, as if fate were pulling the two into fatal replay of history. Branagh's flashy, flourished direction echoes with an array of '40s and '50s classics and near classics (most notably Hitchcock'sRebeccaandSpellbound) and drives the story with an edgy urgency, all the better to distract from some of the sillier elements of the plot. But while this film may not make literal sense in the harsh light of day, in the twilit, shadowy world of classic Hollywood this slyly inventive thriller is a bravura bit of old-fashioned entertainment, done up with modern flair.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302482712"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 336608}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6302289009", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H8X0SC52L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dead Again [VHS]"}

{"description": "When two Italian-American boys from New York are falsely accused of murder in a small Alabama town, they call for a lawyer--but the only lawyer they know is their cousin Vinny (Joe Pesci), who made six attempts before he passed his bar exam.My Cousin Vinnyis a classic fish-out-of-water comedy; the flimsy plot about clearing the two boys and solving the murder is just a hook to support a lot of culture-clash humor. Thanks to the strong cast of character actors like Fred Gwynne, Austin Pendleton, and Lane Smith, it's pretty funny--even old-hat jokes about Brooklyn versus Southern accents come to life. Pesci has played a few too many schticky characters, but this time it works. There's just enough humanity in his caricature to make Vinny likable and entertaining. When the movie was released, there was controversy about whether Marisa Tomei, playing Vinny's big-haired and black-leather-wearing fianc&eacute;e, deserved to win the best supporting actress Oscar (she beat out Judy Davis, Joan Plowright, Miranda Richardson, and Vanessa Redgrave); but seeing her performance on its own, it's a comic marvel and worthy of honor.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303101267", "6300989003", "6301569385", "630281622X", "6300247112", "6305576173", "6304994540", "6300213986", "B00000JGEK", "6301666569", "6302054982"], "also_viewed": ["6301398912", "630339406X", "0792116887", "6304233639"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 107990}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6302516986", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P02PZFZRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "My Cousin Vinny [VHS]"}

{"description": "One of the touchstone movies of the 1980s,Tootsiestars Dustin Hoffman as an out-of-work actor who disguises himself as a dowdy, middle-aged woman to get a part on a hit soap opera. The scheme works, but while he/she keeps up the charade, Hoffman's character comes to see life through the eyes of the opposite sex. The script by Larry Gelbart (with Murray Schisgal) is a winner, and director Sydney Pollack brings taut proficiency to the comedy and sensitivity to the relationship nuances that emerge from Hoffman's drag act. Great supporting work from Teri Garr, Dabney Coleman, Charles Durning, Bill Murray, and pre-stardom Geena Davis. But the film finally belongs to Hoffman, who seems to connect with the character at a very deep and abiding level.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303049079", "0783230893", "B00005NQGQ", "6300247236", "0783216084", "6303394051", "6300185095", "0792842111", "6305576173", "6302415853", "0788833073", "B00005PJ8I", "6300215717", "079074676X", "6305126062", "0800132009", "B000007OY0", "6301670159", "0783221347", "6303402348", "B0002IXSVI", "6300215741", "630428635X", "0800116917", "B00329TVQA", "6300216233", "B00003OSTO", "6304039522", "6302820448"], "bought_together": ["6303049079"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 246559}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.45, "brand": "", "asin": "6302800420", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518D7PSTQFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tootsie [VHS]"}
{"description": "This HBO original comedy, adapted by Larry Gelbart (Tootsie) from the book by Bryan Burrough and John Helyar, concerns one of the most compelling tales of corporate buyout madness in the go-go 1980s. James Garner plays F. Ross Johnson, CEO of RJR Nabisco. Following failed and expensive efforts to sell a smokeless cigarette to the public, Johnson decides that he's had enough of navigating around the wrath of the company's stockholders. Drawing up plans to buy RJR Nabisco outright, he soon finds himself outmatched (though still determined) in a race for the prize with takeover king Henry Kravis (Jonathan Pryce). The ensuing battle is both bitterly funny and full of acid-tinged insights into the '80s greed that changed corporate America forever. Besides Gelbart's great script and Glenn Jordan's competent direction, the star of this exciting film is Garner, who is absolutely wonderful as the gracious Johnson.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_viewed": ["0780631536", "B00CK678G6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 421741}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 7.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6302820545", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZVNRGDX0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Barbarians at the Gate [VHS]"}
{"description": "A champion of illumination and experimental shading, Kurosawa brings his unerring eye for indelible images to Shakespeare in this 1957 adaptation ofMacbeth. By changing the locale from Birnam Wood to 16th-century Japan, Kurosawa makes an oddball argument for the trans-historicity of Shakespeare's narrative; and indeed, stripped to the bare mechanics of the plot, the tale of cutthroat ambition rewarded (and thwarted) feels infinitely adaptable. What's lost in the translation, of course, is the force and beauty of the language--much of the script ofThrone of Bloodis maddeningly repetitive or superfluous--but striking visual images (including the surreal Cobweb Forest and some extremely artful gore) replace the sublime poetry. Toshiro Mifune is theatrically intense as Washizu, the samurai fated to betray his friend and master in exchange for the prestige of nobility; he portrays the ill-fated warrior with a passion bordering on violence, and a barely concealed conviviality. Somewhat less successful is Isuzu Yamada as Washizu's scheming wife; her poise and creepy impassivity, chilling at first, soon grows tedious. Kurosawa himself is the star of the show, though, and his masterful use of black-and-white contrast-- not to mention his steady, dramatic hand with a battle scene--keeps the proceedings thrilling. A must-see for fans of Japanese cinema, as well as all you devotees of samurai weapons and armor.--Miles Bethany", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302969697", "0780018702", "6303202055", "630296931X"], "also_viewed": ["6303202055", "6302919649", "0780021185", "1572522089"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 431622}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.94, "brand": "", "asin": "6302891272", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5196QE0Y8NL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Throne of Blood [VHS]"}

{"description": "This huge 1993 hit for Robin Williams and director Chris Columbus (Home Alone), based on a novel calledAlias Madame Doubtfireby Anne Fine, stars Williams as a loving but flaky father estranged from his frustrated wife (Sally Field). Devastated by a court order limiting his time with the children, Williams's character disguises himself as a warm, old British nanny who becomes the kids' best friend. As with Dustin Hoffman's performance inTootsie, Williams's drag act--buried under layers of latex and padding--is the show, and everything and everyone else on screen serves his sometimes frantic role. Since that's the case, it's fortunate that Williams is Williams, and his performance is terribly funny at times and exceptionally believable in those scenes where his character misses his children. Playing Williams's brother, a professional makeup artist, Harvey Fierstein has a good support role in a bright sequence where he tries a number of feminine looks on Williams before settling on Mrs. Doubtfire's visage.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302091632", "6302800420", "6303257844", "6302765536", "630339406X", "B00329TVQA", "6302581907", "6303140157", "6300247236", "6304416415", "B00004XPQQ", "B000005PFL", "0800196767", "B000008IPR", "0783230893", "B000007OY0", "6304500718", "6302089654", "6303409997", "6300213668", "630273973X", "6304311834", "6302426200"], "bought_together": ["6302800420"], "also_viewed": ["0792151712", "6302961572", "6303314015", "6304233639", "0788806270", "0788812408", "B00005JKDQ", "6304290888", "6303983812", "0788812807", "6302765536", "155890641X", "6305229449", "0788805843", "0788811002", "B00003CXXI", "B00003CXQX", "6301966988", "6304089767", "0790727382", "6303402348", "6304500831", "B0000DCGT1", "6305326940", "5554458521", "6302091632", "6304401132", "B00007J88X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 106101}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.95, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "6303049079", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51lvoybRsfL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mrs Doubtfire [VHS]"}

The filmmakers were able to digitally sample what they'd captured of Lee's performance and piece together enough footage to make the movie releasable. Indeed, it is probably more fascinating for that post-production story than for the tale on the screen.The Crowis appropriately cloaked in ominous expressionistic shadows, oozing urban dread and occult menace from every dank concrete crack, but it really adds up to a simple and perfunctory tale of ritual revenge. Guided by a portentous crow (standing in for Poe's raven), Lee plays a deceased rock musician who returns from the grave to systematically torture and kill the outlandishly violent gang of hoodlums who murdered him and his fianc&eacute;e the year before.

{"description": "Tchaikovsky's timeless Yuletide ballet is presented in an all-new movie version with as much eloquence as one would find in a live stage production. Replete with gorgeous costumes and scenery, George Balanchine's production, adapted by Peter Martins, features the New York City Ballet with narration by Kevin Kline. From the moment the Nutcracker prince winds toymaker Drosselmeier's life-sized dolls, viewers are ushered into the captivating story of a little girl's Christmas Eve fantasy of beauty, magic, and sugarplums. While several versions of this beloved tale are available in video, this one is distinguished for the magnificent performances of a large cast of young ballet dancers from the School of American Ballet. While Culkin lends his star-studded name, that is all he lends in what is mostly a wooden performance (he often appears on the sidelines looking quite blas&eacute; and detached). More deserving accolades go to Jessica Lynn Cohen as Marie, whose genuineness never wanes and dance steps never falter. Bart Robinson Cook is wonderful as the playful Herr Drosselmeier, and Darci Kistler is the graceful Sugarplum Fairy. Mostly this film belongs to children--both on the stage and in the audience. What is lacking in spontaneous energy of live theater is made up for in a perfectly polished performance.

{"description": "Cecil B. DeMille's pre-Hays Code Roman costume drama manages to mix fast-and-loose historical facts with melodrama and titillation. Fredric March plays Marcus Superbus, a Roman soldier and womanizer who jeopardizes his position in Nero's storm troopers by developing a crush on a beautiful Christian girl, Mercia (Elissa Landi). With the Christians keeping their faith far underground, Superbus walks a tightrope between his obligations to the state and his love for Mercia until she and her family are rounded up and hauled off to the arena.The Sign of the Crossis not without its problems; by modern standards, it often seems slow and stagy, and its moralistic message comes across as blunt and heavy-handed. DeMille, however, shrewdly knew how to keep an audience's attention in ways that would have been impossible in subsequent years. Consider Claudette Colbert as the alluring, evil Poppaea, lolling in a bath of asses' milk with her breasts almost completely exposed. Or there's the scene where Marcus tries to get Mercia to loosen up a bit; his idea of a fun time is to take her to an orgy where she's groped by a lesbian during an erotic dance. Then there's Charles Laughton as the decadent Nero, his fey manner abetted by an oiled-up boy-toy at his side in nearly every scene. The climactic scenes at the arena are still violent today, with Christians being gnawed by lions, gladiators knocking each other's brains out, and an Amazon spearing a Pygmy and carrying him around like a kebab!The Sign of the Crosswas heavily cut for rerelease in later years but is now available again in its uncut form.--Jerry Renshaw", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303382991"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 395759}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.62, "brand": "", "asin": "6303382967", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51E06X5ME0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sign of the Cross [VHS]"}

{"description": "The wordBarakameans \"blessing\" in several languages; watching  this film, the viewer is blessed with a dazzling barrage of images that  transcend language. Filmed in 24 countries and set to an ever-changing globalsoundtrack, the movie draws some  surprising connections between various peoples and the spaces they inhabit,  whether that space is a lonely mountaintop or a crowded cigarette factory. Some  of these attempts at connection are more successful than others: for instance,  an early sequence segues between the daily devotions of Tibetan monks, Orthodox  Jews, and whirling dervishes, finding more similarity among these rituals than  one might expect. And there are other amazing moments, as when sped-up footage  of a busy Hong Kong intersection reveals a beautiful symmetry to urban life that  could only be appreciated from the perspective of film. The lack of context is  occasionally frustrating--not knowing where a section was filmed, or the meaning  of the ritual taking place--and some of the transitions are puzzling. However,  the DVD includes a short behind-the-scenes featurette in which cinematographer  Ron Fricke (Koyaanisqatsi) explains that the effect was intentional:  \"It's not where you are that's important, it's what's there.\" And what's here,  inBaraka, is a whole world summed up in 104 minutes.--Larisa Lomacky  Moore", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 435282}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 17.99, "brand": "", "asin": "630349255X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/212T1M480ZL.jpg", "title": "Baraka [VHS]"}

{"description": "David Lean focused all his talent as an epic-maker on Boris Pasternak's sweeping novel about a doctor-poet in revolutionary Russia. The results may sometimes veer toward soap opera, especially with the screen frequently filled with adoring close-ups of Omar Sharif and Julie Christie, but Lean's gift for cramming the screen with spectacle is not to be denied. The streets of Moscow, the snowy steppes of Russia, the house in the country taken over by ice; these are re-created with Lean's unerring sense of grandness. The movie is so lush and so long that it becomes an irresistible wallow, even when logic suffers--likeGone with the Windbefore it andTitanicafter. Sharif, who achieved stardom in Lean's previous film,Lawrence of Arabia, mostly looks noble, but the supporting cast is spiky: Rod Steiger as a fat-cat monster, Tom Courtenay as a self-righteous revolutionary, and Klaus Kinski and Alec Guinness in smaller roles. Geraldine Chaplin, in her adult debut, plays the doctor's compliant wife.

A U.S. bomber is accidentally ordered toward Moscow, ready to drop its load. The U.S. president (Henry Fonda) and various military and congressional leaders must then scramble to deal with the disaster. The built-in suspense is well maintained by director Sidney Lumet, working from a script by former blacklisted writer Walter Bernstein. The solemn, serious approach doesn't begin to touch the brilliance ofStrangelove's inspired take on the nuclear nightmare, butFail Safeis absorbing and well acted (a memorable role for Walter Matthau, for instance). The movie enters unexpected territory in its final minutes; conditioned for feel-good endings, viewers are still genuinely shocked by the plot turns in the final reels.

A happy couple (Norma Aleandro and Hector Alterio) enamored of their careers (she's a teacher proffering pro-government revisionist history, he's a successful entrepreneur) are made all the more joyous by the fulfilling presence of an adopted baby in their lives.

With that genie out of the bottle, everything about the couple's life together begins to look doctored and glossed-over to her, including the marriage itself. Puenzo (Old Gringo) leads the mounting suspicion and conflict between husband and wife toward an astonishing eruption of suppressed feelings, a release of buried truths that is more than the story of one wobbly marital union.

{"description": "You won't find a smarter, more amusing, or more accurate send-up of low-budget filmmaking than Tom DiCillo's 1995 independent feature,Living in Oblivion, wherein a motley cast of would-be artistes blunders its way through a day on the set. Steve Buscemi plays goateed Nick Reve, a harried, sweating director whose crew of numbskulls and egotists seems hell-bent on ruining his film. The trials and tribulations of independent filmmaking are not foreign material for writer-director DiCillo, who cut his teeth as Jim Jarmusch's cinematographer on 1985'sStranger Than Paradisebefore going on to direct his own work, such as the offbeat 1992 comedyJohnny Suede. Like that film,Living in Oblivionrides a precariously thin line between the real and the surreal, featuring a midget actor and an exploding smoke-effects machine, as well as a ridiculously narcissistic Brad Pittesque character played by James Le Gros. While films likeGet Shorty, Fran&#xE7;ois Truffaut'sDay for Night, and Jean-Luc Godard'sContemptsuggest that moviemaking is hip and glamorous,Living in Oblivionwill have none of that. The film within the film feels like a director's primer on what not to do, and this modest-budget gem both lovingly and caustically strips the \"cool\" veneer from the filmmaking process.

{"description": "One of the landmark films of the 1960s,Bonnie and Clydechanged the course of American cinema. Setting a milestone for screen violence that paved the way for Sam Peckinpah'sThe Wild Bunch, this exercise in mythologized biography should not be labeled as a bloodbath; as critic Pauline Kael wrote in her rave review, &quot;it's the absence of sadism that throws the audience off balance.&quot; The film is more of a poetic ode to the Great Depression, starring the dream team of Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway as the titular antiheroes, who barrel across the South and Midwest robbing banks with Clyde's brother Buck (Gene Hackman), Buck's frantic wife Blanche (Estelle Parsons), and their faithful accomplice C.W. Moss (the inimitable Michael J. Pollard).Bonnie and Clydeis an unforgettable classic that has lost none of its power since the 1967 release.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790743531", "6301797906", "1558807780", "0782008348", "0800132009", "B0000040EJ", "630442972X", "6302226899", "6302801133", "0792839846", "6300267865", "630150528X", "6302415853", "B000007OY0", "0800100832", "6300181421", "B000GX7MMA", "6303953425", "6302909023", "6302413435", "B000051S36", "6304286457", "630018627X", "6304039506", "6304698305", "B00005A1VH", "6300182304", "B00004R67T", "6300214028", "6303109950", "0792151712", "6303120474", "6301247485", "630233683X", "6301564456", "6301973380", "6302800420"], "also_viewed": ["1558807780", "0783216084", "0800132009", "0790743213", "6300183513"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 332282}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.98, "brand": "", "asin": "6304039522", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519JDWX45YL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bonnie &amp; Clyde [VHS]"}

{"description": "Having developed his skill as a master of contemporary crime drama, writer-director Michael Mann displayed every aspect of that mastery in this intelligent, character-driven thriller from 1995, which also marked the first onscreen pairing of Robert De&nbsp;Niro and Al Pacino. The two great actors had played father and son in the separate time periods ofThe Godfather, Part&nbsp;II, but this was the first film in which the pair appeared together, and although their only scene together is brief, it's the riveting fulcrum of this high-tech cops-and-robbers scenario. De&nbsp;Niro plays a master thief with highly skilled partners (Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore) whose latest heist draws the attention of Pacino, playing a seasoned Los Angeles detective whose investigation reveals that cop and criminal lead similar lives. Both are so devoted to their professions that their personal lives are a disaster. Pacino's with a wife (Diane Venora) who cheats to avoid the reality of their desolate marriage; De&nbsp;Niro pays the price for a life with no outside connections; and Kilmer's wife (Ashley Judd) has all but given up hope that her husband will quit his criminal career. These are men obsessed, and as De&nbsp;Niro and Pacino know, they'll both do whatever's necessary to bring the other down. Mann's brilliant screenplay explores these personal obsessions and sacrifices with absorbing insight, and the tension mounts with some of the most riveting action sequences ever filmed--most notably a daylight siege that turns downtown Los Angeles into a virtual war zone of automatic gunfire. At nearly three hours, the film qualifies as a kind of intimate epic, certain to leave some viewers impatiently waiting for more action, but it's all part of Mann's compelling strategy.Heatis a true rarity: a crime thriller with equal measures of intense excitement and dramatic depth, giving De&nbsp;Niro and Pacino a prime showcase for their finely matched talents.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000003KHS", "6300183211", "B00000IO4G", "630018627X", "6303421563", "B00000JGEI", "6302415853", "630018403X", "0800199421", "6304258984", "0784011923", "6304259131", "6302482712", "6303953425", "B00007CVYA", "0783223218", "6300214540", "6302054982", "0790731274", "B00000ILE6", "0792147618", "079073799X", "6301208773", "6301888901", "0790701251", "0792133153", "6302378648", "6302282535", "6305718792", "6304414099", "6303696813", "0790748169", "B0002ZDVFE", "B000077VT7", "6303269834", "6302516919", "630428649X", "B00008R9K9", "6303036570", "6302814782", "0792116887", "0792158261", "0790705141", "6304508611", "6301071379", "B00005Q4GY", "076783819X", "6300214567", "6303020089", "6303383300", "6302945089", "B0002GTWOM", "B00003CXE6", "0792841778", "6301797930", "0800116917", "0800179552", "B0000040EJ", "B00005A7VC", "6300182878"], "also_viewed": ["B000003KHS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 286071}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.98, "brand": "", "asin": "6304214502", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4160ZFH45VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Heat [VHS]"}

{"description": "This strange and charming documentary by Al Pacino, in which he also stars, is an exploration of several topics: Shakespeare and his hump-backed villain, the impulse to act, the way actors work--and Pacino's single-minded effort to make the Bard accessible to all audiences and not just the effete few. Over the course of the film, Pacino alternately discusses the role and the text; roams Manhattan, talking about Shakespeare with everyone from scholars to people on the street; and re-creates scenes from the play in a production staged at the Cloisters, an evocative castle-like museum on the north end of Manhattan. He assembles a cast that includes Kevin Spacey, Winona Ryder, Estelle Parsons, and Alec Baldwin to perform the scenes, and he slips back and forth between text and discussion of the play in a way that makes Shakespeare comprehensible and fascinating to viewers who know or care nothing about his writing.--Marshall Fine", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 263742}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Looking for Richard [VHS]", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00DQN6IOK", "B00B1E6EAY", "B00ECR7KX2", "B0002TVWYW", "B004M9ZI0M", "B00B2BYY1W", "6301863240", "6305622892", "6304046006"], "also_viewed": ["B000A9QK50"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BNGXAGY7L._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "6304393075"}
{"description": "Political heavyweights decide that Jefferson Smith (James Stewart), an obscure scoutmaster in a small town, would be the perfect dupe to fill a vacant U.S. Senate chair. Surely this naive bumpkin can be easily controlled by the senior senator (Claude Rains) from his state, a respectable and corrupted career politician. Director Frank Capra fills the movie with Smith's wide-eyed wonder at the glories of Washington, all of which ring false for his cynical secretary (Jean Arthur), who doesn't believe for a minute this rube could be for real. But he is. Capra was repeating the formula of a previous film,Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, but this one is even sharper; Stewart and Arthur are brilliant, and the former cowboy star Harry Carey lends a warm presence to the role of the vice president. Bright, funny, and beautifully paced,Mr. Smith Goes to Washingtonis Capra's ode to the power of innocence--an idea so potent that present-day audiences may find themselves wishing for a new Mr. Smith in Congress. The 1939 Congress was none too thrilled about the film's depiction of their august body, denouncing it as a caricature; but even today, Capra's jibes about vested interests and political machines look as accurate as ever.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B006FE83UE", "B0000049FG", "B00AEBB89C", "B002VWNIAY", "B001D8W7EU", "0800113047", "6303215734", "B0045HCJQW", "B0000JBALO", "0783222955", "B00000F13T", "6300181472", "1558807780", "6300181111", "6305282927"], "bought_together": ["B006FE83UE"], "also_viewed": ["B006FE83UE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 430231}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.67, "brand": "", "asin": "6304481691", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K2W1W387L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mr Smith Goes to Washington [VHS]"}

{"description": "Dashing Errol Flynn is the definitive Robin Hood in the most gloriously swashbuckling version of the legendary story. Warner Brothers reunited Michael Curtiz, their top-action director, with the winning team of Flynn and Olivia de Havilland (Maid Marian) and perennial villain Basil Rathbone as the aristocratic Sir Guy of Gisbourne, and pulled out all stops for the production. It became their costliest film to date, a grandly handsome, glowing Technicolor adventure set to a stirring,Oscar-winning scoreby Erich Wolfgang Korngold. The decadent Prince John (a smoothly conniving Claude Rains) takes advantage of King Richard's absence to tax the country into poverty but meets his match in the medieval guerrilla rebel Robin Hood and his Merry Men of Sherwood Forest, who rise up and, to quote a clich&eacute; coined by the film, \"steal from the rich and give to the poor.\" Stocky Alan Hale Sr. plays Robin's loyal friend Little John (a part he played in Douglas Fairbanks's silent version), Eugene Palette the portly Friar Tuck, and Melville Cooper the bumbling Sheriff of Nottingham. Flynn's confidence and cocky charm makes for a perfect Robin Hood, and his easygoing manner is a marvelous counterpoint to Rathbone's regal bearing and courtly diction. The film climaxes in their rousing battle-to-the-finish sword fight, a magnificently choreographed scene highlighted by Curtiz's inventive use of shadows cast upon the castle walls.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302120527", "6301976932", "6301977181", "6301977149", "6303212263", "6305123616", "B00004RFHL", "6301574117", "0790743159", "6300214060", "B00005A1VH", "6304178352", "0792839846", "630233683X", "6301977173", "6302961688", "630150528X", "6304935811", "B00005RRG6", "B00000JKNP", "6301973305", "6301670140", "1558800034", "0792107683", "B00004RGUU", "0782008348"], "bought_together": ["6301977149"], "also_viewed": ["B00005PJ8I"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 538065}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6304546386", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RMAFMQ02L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Adventures of Robin Hood [VHS]"}

{"description": "An economic crisis brings unemployed Nada (Roddy Piper) to L.A. in search of work.  What he finds instead is that the ruling elite of the world are aliens in disguise, their aim being to keep humans in a state of mindless consumerism.  His discovery comes when he dons a pair of special sunglasses made by a resistance group and sees for the first time reality unadorned.  Billboards, store signs, magazine covers--all bear subliminal messages to OBEY, to CONSUME, to have NO INDEPENDENT THOUGHT.  Money itself says THIS IS YOUR GOD. But worst of all, with these glasses you see which of us are really hideous, bug-eyed aliens.  The conceptual breakthrough is hilarious while keeping its roots in darker matters.  Although some fault the film for settling into its action plot, the ending has a great payoff. And the direction by John Carpenter is handled with superb workmanlike aplomb. One unforgettable set piece has Piper in a back-alley fistfight with a friend who won't put on the glasses that goes on and on, and just when you think it's over it goes another round.

{"description": "If you were to argue that Mel Brooks'sYoung Frankensteinranks among the top-ten funniest movies of all time, nobody could reasonably dispute the claim. Spoofing classic horror in the way that Brooks's previous filmBlazing Saddlessent up classic Westerns, the movie is both a loving tribute and a raucous, irreverent parody of Universal's classic horror filmsFrankenstein(1931) andBride of Frankenstein(1935). Filming in glorious black and white, Brooks re-created theFrankensteinlaboratory using the same equipment from the originalFrankenstein(courtesy of designer Kenneth Strickfaden), and this loving attention to physical and stylistic detail creates a solid foundation for nonstop comedy. The story, of course, involves Frederick Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) and his effort to resume experiments in re-animation pioneered by his late father. (He's got some help, since dad left behind a book titledHow I Did It.) Assisting him is the hapless hunchback Igor (Marty Feldman) and the buxom but none-too-bright maiden Inga (Teri Garr), and when Frankenstein succeeds in creating his monster (Peter Boyle), the stage is set for an outrageous revision of the Frankenstein legend. With comedy highlights too numerous to mention, Brooks guides his brilliant cast (also including Cloris Leachman, Madeline Kahn, Kenneth Mars, and Gene Hackman in a classic cameo role) through scene after scene of inspired hilarity. Indeed,Young Frankensteinis a charmed film, nothing less than a comedy classic, representing the finest work from everyone involved. Not one joke has lost its payoff, and none of the countless gags have lost their zany appeal. From a career that includes some of the best comedies ever made, this is the film for which Mel Brooks will be most fondly remembered.

{"description": "Peter Weir directed this comedy-drama, a commentary on all-pervasive media manipulation. Scripted by Andrew M. Niccol (Gattaca), the film plays like a combination of the British TV series The Prisoner and Paul Bartel's The Secret Cinema. Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) is unaware that his entire life is a hugely popular 24-hour-a-day TV series. In this real-time documentary, every moment of Truman's existence is captured by concealed cameras and telecast to a giant global audience. His friends and family are actors who smile pleasantly at Truman's familiar catchphrase greeting, \"In case I don't see you later, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!\" Employed at an insurance company, Truman is married to merry Meryl (Laura Linney), and they live in the cheerful community of Seahaven, an island \"paradise\" where the weather is always mild and no unpleasantness intrudes. This is the basic situation of the series, which has grown over the years into a billion-dollar franchise for the TV network. As an unwanted pregnancy, Truman was adopted by the network and raised in the zoolike environment of a TV soundstage. Thus, the TV audience became hooked when Truman was very young. Now, at age 30, he still doesn't know he's a prisoner on an immense domed city-size soundstage, simulating Seahaven. Both the illusion and the ratings will collapse if Truman ever leaves Seahaven. In addition to elaborate events staged to make sure he stays put, Truman is given constant reminders of how wonderful Seahaven is compared to dangers in other parts of the world. However, his growing suspicions make him curious enough to try to leave, and the show's director and master manipulator Christof (Ed Harris) must constantly devise ways to thwart Truman's escape attempts. To enter the harbor, Truman must overcome his fear of water, intentionally instilled in him when his father \"died\" in a boating accident and was written out of the script.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790731649"], "bought_together": ["0790731649"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 319413}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "", "asin": "630518299X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GRFF4KA1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Truman Show [VHS]"}

{"description": "What can two little mice possibly do to save an orphan girl who's  fallen into evil hands? With a little cooperation and faith in oneself,  anything is possible! As members of the mouse-run International Rescue  Aid Society, Bernard and Miss Bianca respond to orphan Penny's call for  help. The two mice search for clues and, with the help of an old cat named  Rufus, track Penny to the clutches of the evil Madame Medusa in a  dilapidated ship in Devil's Bayou. It turns out that Medusa is using Penny  to locate and retrieve the Devil's Eye Diamond--a stone she'll stop at  nothing to possess. With a cunning plan, courageous acts, cooperation from  local animal life, and lots of faith, Bernard and Miss Bianca help  Penny find the diamond and escape from Medusa. The result of their  adventure is that Bernard and Miss Bianca become close friends and Penny  gets adopted. This somewhat dark, classic 1977 animated Disney film is based on Margery  Sharp'sThe RescuersandMiss Bianca, and features the Academy Award-nominated song \"Someone's Waiting for You.\" Voice talents include  Eva Gabor as Miss Bianca, Bob Newhart as Bernard, Geraldine Page as Madame  Medusa, and Jim Jordan (radio's Fibber McGee) as Orville Albatross.

{"description": "Italy's rubber-faced funnyman Roberto Benigni accomplishes the  impossible in his World War&nbsp;II comedyLife Is Beautiful: he shapes a  simultaneously hilarious and haunting comedy out of the tragedy of the Holocaust. An international sensation and the most successful foreign language film in U.S. history, the picture also earned director-cowriter-star Benigni Oscars for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Actor. He plays the Jewish country boy Guido, a madcap romantic in Mussolini's Italy who wins the heart of his sweetheart (Benigni's real-life sweetie, Nicoletta Braschi) and raises a darling son (the adorable Giorgio Cantarini) in the shadow of fascism. When the Nazis ship the men off to a concentration camp in the waning days of the war, Guido is determined to shelter his son from the evils around them and convinces him they're in an elaborate contest to win (of all things) a tank. Guido tirelessly maintains the ruse with comic ingenuity, even as the horrors escalate and the camp's population continues to dwindle--all the more  impetus to keep his son safe, secure, and, most of all, hidden. Benigni walks a fine line mining comedy from tragedy and his efforts are pure fantasy--he accomplishes feats no man could realistically pull off--both of  which have drawn fire from a few critics. Yet for all its wacky humor and inventive gags,Life Is Beautifulis a moving and poignant tale of one father's sacrifice to save not just his young son's life but his innocence in the face of one of the most evil acts ever perpetrated by the human race.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003JLL2RW", "B00007G25J", "B00000493Q", "6300216012", "0800100832"], "bought_together": ["B003JLL2RW"], "also_viewed": ["B0033PQUXA", "B00B0U2SEA", "B004SEUJ82", "6305291403", "0784011710", "B0010YSD7W", "B00AYXEW0C", "B000HEWEJO", "B000FVQLRA", "B0002CX1NY", "6303215734", "0783233477", "B00AEFY0F2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 290895}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.96, "brand": "", "asin": "6305426651", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51W27JXJYQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Life Is Beautiful (La Vita E Bella) [VHS]"}

{"description": "This remake of Neil Simon's 1970 comedy finds Goldie Hawn and Steve Martin as Ohio yokels cast adrift in Rudy Giuliani's sanitized New York City. With their son recently departed for Britain, the empty-nesters travel to the Big Apple for a job interview and are beset with all kinds of bad luck, starting with their flight being rerouted to Boston. Things only go downhill from there, of course, as they're mugged by an Andrew Lloyd Webber imposter, the high-tech multilingual navigation system on their rented Cadillac goes haywire, and their hotel reservations fall through. Though this movie is marred by some out-of-place slapstick and mawkish romance scenes, it's not without its funny moments.

{"description": "Are you wondering just exactly who the Blair Witch was? What the Burkittsville, Maryland, legend was all about? Or what exactly fascinated student filmmaker Heather and what possibly took her, Mike, and Josh from this earth? Get all your background questions answered byCurse of the Blair Witch, a one-stop-shopping \"documentary\" originally produced for the Sci-Fi Channel as a tie-in marketing tool. Entirely fictionalized,Curse of the Blair Witchfocuses both on the past and the present, with copious info on the Blair Witch myth as well as on the disappearance of Heather, Josh, and Mike. As it turns out, the original witch was one Elly Kedward, who was accused in 1785 of taking blood from several children; she was subsequently banished to the harsh winter woods and left for dead. Her grisly and bloody legacy involves missing children, polluted water, disemboweled men, and a serial killer of children who claims to have been haunted by \"an old woman ghost.\" Aside from some ineffective \"newsreel\" footage of the serial killer, all this intriguing information is presented convincingly and chillingly.Cursemay in fact freak you out more than the movie, and it evokes the great, pulpyIn Search Ofseries of the '70s, one of the prime inspirations for filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez. News clips of the search for Heather, Josh, and Mike lend a v&eacute;rit&eacute; atmosphere to the proceedings, but shed little light on their mysterious disappearance or their characters. Basically, it's a tease to go see the movie. Still,The Blair Witch Projectprovided only ever-so-slight information on the legend that haunted the forest, so you'll want this cleverly constructed mock documentary to supplement your knowledge of the film.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["0743411536", "B0002IHP1C"], "also_viewed": ["B000056V6H"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 287495}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 7.87, "brand": "", "asin": "6305568901", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SAG2GJGGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Curse of the Blair Witch [VHS]"}

{"description": "\"I have a bad feeling about this,\" says the young Obi-Wan Kenobi  (played by Ewan McGregor) inStar Wars: Episode I, The Phantom  Menaceas he steps off a spaceship and into the most anticipated cinematic event... well, ever. He might as well be speaking for the  legions of fans of the original episodes in theStar Warssaga  who can't help but secretly ask themselves: Sure, this isStar  Wars, but is itmy Star Wars? The original elevated  moviegoers' expectations so high that it would have been impossible for  any subsequent film to meet them. And as with all theStar Warsmovies,The Phantom Menacefeatures inexplicable plot twists, a  fistful of loose threads, and some cheek-chewing dialogue. Han Solo's  swagger is sorely missed, as is the pervading menace of heavy-breathing  Darth Vader. There is still way too much quasi-mystical mumbo jumbo,  and some of what was fresh aboutStar Wars22 years earlier  feels formulaic. Yet there's much to admire. The special effects are  stupendous; three worlds are populated with a m&eacute;lange of creatures, flora, and horizons rendered in absolute  detail. The action and battle scenes are breathtaking in their  complexity. And one particular sequence of the film--the  adrenaline-infused pod race through the Tatooine desert--makes the chariot race inBen-Hurlook like a Sunday stroll through the park.Among the host of new characters, there are a few familiar walk-ons. We  witness the first meeting between R2-D2 and C-3PO, Jabba the Hutt looks  younger and slimmer (but not young and slim), and Yoda is as crabby as  ever. Natalie Portman's stately Queen Amidala sports hairdos that make  Princess Leia look dowdy and wields a mean laser. We never bond with  Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson), and Obi-Wan's day is yet to come. Jar Jar Binks, a cross  between a Muppet, a frog, and a hippie, provides many of the movie's lighter moments, while Sith Lord Darth  Maul is a formidable force. Baby-faced Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) looks too young  and innocent to command the powers of the Force or wield a lightsaber (much less transmute into the future Darth Vader), but his  boyish exuberance wins over skeptics.Near the end of the movie, Palpatine, the new leader of the Republic,  may be speaking for fans eagerly awaitingEpisode IIwhen he  pats young Anakin on the head and says, \"We will watch your career with  great interest.\" Indeed! --Tod Nelson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000633ZP", "6301792734", "B00005JLXH", "B00006HBUJ", "6304539258", "6304539274", "6301792769", "B000FQVX78", "6304539290", "0792158261", "B000FQJAJG", "6304117752", "0767729307", "B001GQSY5K", "6304178352", "B000FAGGWQ", "B00BBND56G", "B000FQJAIW", "B00005LL26", "B00003CXCT", "B00003CXI0", "B002I9Z8AS", "B00006AL1C", "B00CFWWDWE", "B000066HAS", "B000001ON6", "B000MUANT6", "6305587159"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLXH", "B00006HBUJ"], "also_viewed": ["B00006HBUJ", "B00005JLXH", "B00E9PMML2", "B0000633ZP", "6301792734", "B00BBND56G", "6304539258", "6301792769", "6304539274", "B00006JDUE", "0767729307", "B00E9PMMX0", "B000FQJAIW", "B000FQVX78", "B000FQJAJG", "B00000IQMT", "B000FAGGWQ", "B003ZSJ212", "0345434110", "6303148352", "6304089767", "0439834775", "6304117752", "B00BUZW14M", "6304500831", "0590010891", "0345341465", "6304434340", "B001GQSY5K", "155890641X", "B00005LL26", "6302961572", "0792151712", "B003W77SEO", "B000M4Y8JI", "0767825411", "B00003CXXI", "B00000IZ8A", "B00169IZN8", "6302787068", "B00006G8LB", "080010367X", "0800125762", "6302091632", "0792158261", "B000850IS6", "6300214826", "6303506291", "B00005V1Z8", "B000641D2Y", "0784011923", "B00008Y47S", "6300214060", "630382790X", "B00003CXI0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 79460}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.44, "brand": "Star Wars", "asin": "630575067X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41SJPKK4S4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Wars - Episode I, The Phantom Menace [VHS]"}

{"description": "John Lasseter and his gang of high-tech creators at Pixar create another entertainment for the ages. Like the few great movie sequels,Toy Story&nbsp;2comments on why the first one was so wonderful while finding a fresh angle worthy of a new film. The craze of toy collecting becomes the focus here, as we find out Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) is not only a beloved toy to Andy but also a rare doll from a popular '60s children's show. When a greedy collector takes Woody, Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) launches a rescue mission with Andy's other toys. To say more would be a crime because this is one of the most creative and smile-inducing films since, well, the firstToy Story.Although the toys look the same as in the 1994 feature, Pixar shows how much technology has advanced: the human characters look more human, backgrounds are superior, and two action sequences that book-end the film are dazzling. And it's a hoot for kids and adults. The film is packed with spoofs, easily accessible in-jokes, and inspired voice casting (with newcomer Joan Cusack especially a delight as Cowgirl Jessie). But as the Pixar canon of films illustrates, the filmmakers are storytellers first. Woody's heart-tugging predicament can easily be translated into the eternal debate of living a good life versus living  forever.Toy Story&nbsp;2also achieved something in the U.S. two other outstanding 1999 animated features (The Iron Giant,Princess Mononoke) could not: it became a huge box-office hit.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304089767", "B00005JKDQ", "B0000AQZYM", "6305326940", "0788805843", "0788812408", "155890641X", "6303314015", "0788802194", "B000035Z2S", "0788805533", "6305229449", "078881172X", "6304500831", "0788812807", "6302526574", "6302642248", "6303983812", "B00003CXQX", "6304401132", "0788806270", "6302787068", "6305940932", "6302320402", "6304290888", "6303534422", "B00275EHJG", "B00004T2SI", "6305319138", "B00005JL95", "0788803743", "6302178924", "6300274268", "6304100507", "6305942285", "B00004R99N", "6300275310", "B00006CXK5", "B00003CXXI", "B00005JMQY", "6304400225", "6304400551", "6302961572", "6303122647", "6304501153", "B00005JKX3", "0788811002", "6300274195", "B0000E32WB", "6303929338", "B00005T7H6", "6304978286", "B00005RDVV", "B00016JF2W", "6302158095", "B0000524CZ", "6304401736", "B000035Z46", "B00003CXHR", "0788812440", "6303036813", "6304089201", "B0007A2GSM", "B00000JS61", "B000028U3S", "B00005RRG3", "6301991311", "B00003CWPW", "B00009L4S1", "6304400381", "6300274608", "B00003CXQ6", "B00000I7Q3", "0788812181", "B000AY74OQ", "6305559295", "0792153677", "B00005LOUS", "0788809806", "078880720X", "B000009CTR", "1558906150", "B00001YX9H", "6301390725", "B00007AJLB", "B00000J2JA", "6304434340", "0783221800", "B00000ICHA", "1558907718", "6303148387", "B00004T2SJ", "6304155972", "6303939015", "0788810448", "6301404440", "630169774X", "B00003CXQ0", "6302968143", "B00006IUM9"], "also_viewed": ["6304089767", "6303314015", "B00005JKDQ", "B0000AQZYM", "0788805843", "6302787068", "0788812408", "6305326940", "155890641X", "0788805533", "0788802194", "6305940932", "6302320402", "078881172X", "6305229449", "6302526574", "6304500831", "B000035Z2S", "B00003CXQX", "6303983812", "6302642248", "6304100507", "6300274195", "6304290888", "0788812807", "0788806270", "6303036813", "6300274268", "6305319138", "B00005JL95", "6304501153", "6300275310", "B00004T2SI", "6303534422", "6305942285", "6302178924", "B00003CXXI", "6304401132", "6302961572", "B0007KTBIU", "6304400551", "6303929338", "6304089201", "B00004R99N", "6304978286", "B0000524CZ", "B00275EHJG", "B00005JKX3", "B00000I7Q3", "B00003CXHR", "6304089112", "6302426200", "B0000E32WB", "B00006CXK5", "B0030IIZ4M", "6305310068", "6304401736", "B00016JF2W", "B000063V8N"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 182756}, "asin": "6305949557", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515BCFM46JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Toy Story 2 [VHS]"}

But blasted lawsuits and public disapproval forced them and other supers to go incognito, making it even tougher for their school-age kids, the shy Violet and the aptly named Dash.

{"description": "There's no rule against rock anthems from the 1970s in the soundtrack for a movie about a medieval jousting champion, but if you're going to attempt such jarring anachronisms, you'd better establish acceptable ground rules. Writer-director Brian Helgeland does precisely that inA Knight's Taleand pulls off this trick with such giddy aplomb that you can't help but play along. (Upon witnessing a crowd of peasants at a jousting match, singing and clapping to the beat of Queen's \"We Will Rock You,\" you're either going to love this movie or dismiss it altogether.) Other vintage rock hits will follow, but Helgeland--the Oscar&#xAE;-winning cowriter ofL.A. Confidential--handles this ploy with judicious goodwill, in what is an otherwise honest period piece about a peasant named William (Heath Ledger) who rises by grit and determination to the hallowed status of knighthood.As if the soundtrack weren't audacious enough, Helgeland (recovering from the sour experience of his directorial debut,Payback) casts none other than Geoffrey Chaucer (wonderfully played by Paul Bettany) as William's cohort and match announcer, along with William's pals Roland (Mark Addy) and Wat (Alan Tudyk), and feisty blacksmith Kate (Laura Fraser). Of course there must be a fair maiden, and she is Jocelyn (newcomer Shannyn Sossamon), with whom William falls in love while battling the nefarious Count Adhemar (Rufus Sewell) on the European jousting circuit.

{"description": "This DVD is packed with extras designed for kids and special-effects enthusiastics. Stuart himself hosts the extras, guiding the viewer through the special menus. A favorite with the kids will probably be the game asking questions about the movie. Using clips from the movie and three different levels, it's quite appealing. As for meatier things, there is a curious look at animators' \"tryouts\" in creating Stuart, plus excellent demonstrations of how Stuart interacts with humans, using multiple images and commentary. Another highlight is seeing the first conceptual drawings of the boat race, vastly different from the final sequence. There are two commentary tracks on the film, one with the visual-effects team revealing their secrets and the other with the engaging director, Rob Minkoff. Also including  short documentaries, music videos, and a read-along book with Stuart,  this is a rare disc because the kids will like the extras as much as the film.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JLGM", "B000M343BC", "B00003CXJ4", "B000CQ98FU", "B00AEFXMSS", "B004HO6I4M", "B0006JMLRK", "B002WJI2QQ", "B000MV9026", "B0012EM5D8", "B001DPHDCY", "B004EPZ034", "6305161887", "B00005JNQS", "0783231474", "B005SDUV4E", "B0006UEVT0", "B00CWM58WY", "B0000AOX0O", "B000065V42", "B00000JL8E", "B0000VV4W2", "B005F96UJ6", "B00029LO0Y", "0783219806", "0783219733", "B0000VCZKW", "B00H5NY7O0", "B0000AK7AB", "B00009YXAW", "B000RMJ4F8", "B00AEFYO08", "B00GT85OLC", "B00005JG6M", "B000UVKGPI", "B000XKW2WG", "B003L4Y5BW", "B001U3D88M", "0064400565", "B00005JM7T", "B000ION23A", "B007FF3HQM", "B0006J28MI", "B000EOMB9U", "B0018ATR2S", "B00005LB87", "B002GHHHNS", "B001GCUNWQ", "B005LAIIT4", "B003R2BWJG", "B00005JMQZ", "B000056H26", "B000LPS2VI", "B0084IHVUC", "B004LWZW9W", "B008R65XKG", "B00EBBGLFC", "B00028HBES", "B0030ZIZRC", "B004AKCME8", "B00AEFXMGU", "B001LPWGFA", "0783232292", "B0000VCZKM", "B005LAIISA", "B000U1ZV5I", "B000NQRV4Y", "B000CZ0PT4", "B00JK531ES", "B008R65XPQ", "B001P4Q3CY", "B0000UJDLM", "B00003CXG7", "B00B7EQPNE", "B001ILFUD2", "B000J10FLY", "B000AY74OG", "B0042U94UQ", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00K2CHSS8", "B008NNY9QW", "B00006LPHB", "B000V5IP6U", "B00HLTD2OE", "B0009NZ2KG", "B000P0J09W", "B00365F6I2", "B000A2WAQK", "B00F522C7C", "B007R6DJP8", "B0087F7VSY", "B000Y11B7G", "B0039N74CW", "B00005JMFH", "B0016Q2D5M", "B003H9M1Q2", "B00005JLR2", "B000H5TH2A", "B00DV2MVWO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004HO6I4M", "B00CWM58WY", "B004EPZ034", "B000H5TH2A"]}, "price": 12.86, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 149960}, "asin": "B00000F7AE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YZM5J2MJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Stuart Little (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Fritz Lang's first major success as a director was with this exotic, globetrotting adventure. It's actually made up of two short silent features that were the first of a proposed quartet of movies about the adventures of high-society adventurer Kay Hoog (Carl de Vogt, whose gaunt, expressionless face resembles a younger William S. Hart) and his arch nemesis, a secret criminal organization known as the Spiders. Part 1 (\"The Golden Lake\") is a treasure hunt that takes both Kay and Spiders mastermind Lio Sha (Ressel Orla) to Peru, where they battle primitive Incas (who capture Lio for a human sacrifice) and each other for a fortune in hidden gold. Part 2 (\"The Diamond Ship\") is a longer and far more intricate conspiracy involving a hidden criminal underground beneath the streets of Chinatown, a legendary lost jewel known as the Buddha Head Diamond, and an ambitious plot to rule all of Asia. Full of secret passages, coded messages, treasure maps, double-crosses, and death-defying escapes, Lang's pulpy action-fantasy borrows from the wacky serials of Louis Feuillaude (notably the deliriously entertainingLes Vampires). But behind the wild plots, gorgeous sets, and driving, breakneck-paced direction lies a dark undercurrent of death and doom that transforms his gallant hero into a brooding, vengeful spirit. The prints are seriously scratched and worn in places but always watchable.

The result might resemble Alejandro Amenabar's remarkable second feature,Open Your Eyes, which favors ideas over effects and offers twist upon twist with mind-warping agility. This film rewards multiple viewings, pushing the viewer toward one perception of reality, then switching to another until reality itself is called into question. Melodrama, love story, and psychological thriller combine with a dash of science fiction, forming a plot that is both disorienting and deceptively precise.Set in Madrid, the story defies description, but this much can be revealed: young, handsome Cesar (Eduardo Noriega) is vain, rich, charming, and--following a botched suicide-murder scheme by a jilted lover--horribly disfigured. He'd fallen in love with Sofia (Pen&eacute;lope Cruz) but is now an embittered husk of his former self, stuck in a \"psychiatric penitentiary\" on a murder charge and hiding behind an expressionless mask. His reality has crumbled, but as the film's agenda is gradually revealed, we realize that there are other factors in play. Exposing that agenda would be a criminal offense against those who haven't seen the film; suffice it to say thatOpen Your Eyestakes you into the twilight zone and beyond, and does so cleverly enough to prompt Tom Cruise to produce and star in an English-language remake,Vanilla Sky. The 2001 remake, directed by Cameron Crowe, costars Cameron Diaz and Pen&eacute;lope Cruz, who reprises her original role.--Jeff Shannon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 580019}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.98, "brand": "", "asin": "B00000JMOI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41R2BBJY96L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Open Your Eyes [VHS]"}

{"description": "Volume 5 from the DVD collection of originalStar Trekprograms  includes \"What Are Little Girls Made Of?\" Written by Robert Bloch (author of  the novelPsycho, the basis of Hitchcock's film), the episode finds  Captain Kirk (William Shatner) and nurse Christine Chapel (Majel Barrett)  beaming down to planet Exo&nbsp;III, where Christine is to be reunited with her  fianc&eacute;, Dr. Roger Korby (Michael Strong). The meeting is less than  joyful,  however, when it becomes clear that Korby has been developing androids that  he intends to spread throughout the galaxy--using theEnterpriseas his  delivery vehicle. This was certainly the first significant performance for  Majel Barrett in theTrekfamily; longtime fans know she went on to  play Lwaxana Troi onThe Next Generation(and Mrs.&nbsp;Gene Roddenberry in  real life). An entertaining episode all around, with the notion of an android  Kirk somehow amusing. (Maybe it was the android who sang on that notorious  Shatner album.) Fans of '60s TV will also enjoy the performance of Ted Cassidy (the original Lurch from TV'sThe Addams Family) as the giant android, Ruk.Also on this DVD is \"Dagger of the Mind,\" another mad-doctor drama. This  time, Kirk delivers supplies to a penal colony on Tantalus&nbsp;V, where he  meets the renowned Dr.&nbsp;Tristan Adams. Adams has been working on the  development of a neural neutralizer to control and manipulate dangerous  patients. When Kirk threatens to expose him as a dangerous megalomaniac,  Adams uses the technology on the unfortunate captain. This tense piece set in  a madhouse atmosphere makes for a riveting episode, with a few unhinged  performances adding to the fun.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000022TTP", "6305744858", "B000059XU0", "B00001MXXW", "B00001MXXS", "6305744882", "6305513406", "0792160932", "B00004W5UI", "6305513414", "B00004Y62Z", "B0002JJBZO", "6305910464", "B00005ASGJ", "6305755035", "6305910537", "0792160959", "B000055Z4J", "B00005KHK3", "B00005BCK7", "B00005ASGI", "B00004Y630", "B00004W5UH", "B00005QTAR", "B000055Z4I", "B00005J6RF", "B00005J6RE", "B00005BCK6", "B000A2S7VM", "B00005M2CZ", "B00005M2D0", "B00005KHK4", "B00005QAPY", "B00005NVDI", "B00005Q79B", "B000059XTZ", "B00005N5SE", "B00005QTAS", "B00005NVDJ", "B00005N5SF", "B004IIPUSC", "B000PMBEAI", "6305755043", "6305669392"], "bought_together": ["B000022TTP"], "buy_after_viewing": ["6305910537", "B00005N5SE", "B000055Z4J", "B00001MXXW"]}, "price": 14.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 329803}, "asin": "B000022TTI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RYDJB0F1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek - The Original Series, Vol. 5, Episodes 10 &amp; 11: What Are Little Girls Made Of?/ Dagger of the Mind"}

At 178  minutes, it's long enough to establish the myriad inhabitants of Middle-earth,  the legendary Rings of Power, and the fellowship of hobbits, elves, dwarves, and  humans--led by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the brave hobbit Frodo  (Elijah Wood)--who must battle terrifying forces of evil on their perilous  journey to destroy the One Ring in the land of Mordor. Superbly paced, the film  is both epic and intimate, offering astonishing special effects and production  design while emphasizing the emotional intensity of Frodo's adventure.

{"description": "Before it ever arrived in the U.S., this epic, animated 1997 fantasy had already made history as the top-grossing domestic feature ever released in Japan, where its combination of mythic themes, mystical forces, and ravishing visuals tapped deeply into cultural identity and contemporary, ecological anxieties. For international animation andanimefans,Princess Mononokerepresents an auspicious next step for its revered creator, Hayao Miyazaki (My Neighbor Totoro,Kiki's Delivery Service), an acknowledgedanimepioneer, whose painterly style, vivid character design, and stylized approach to storytelling take ambitious, evolutionary steps here.Set in medieval Japan, Miyazaki's original story envisions a struggle between nature and man. The march of technology, embodied in the dark iron forges of the ambitious Tatara clan, threatens the natural forces explicit in the benevolent Great God of the Forest and the wide-eyed, spectral spirits he protects. When Ashitaka, a young warrior from a remote, and endangered, village clan, kills a ravenous, boar-like monster, he discovers the beast is in fact an infectious \"demon god,\" transformed by human anger. Ashitaka's quest to solve the beast's fatal curse brings him into the midst of human political intrigues as well as the more crucial battle between man and nature.Miyazaki's convoluted fable is clearly not the stuff of kiddie matinees, nor is the often graphic violence depicted during the battles that ensue. If some younger viewers (or less attentive older ones) will wish for a diagram to sort out the players, Miyazaki's atmospheric world and its lush visual design are reasons enough to watch. For the English-language version, Miramax assembled an impressive vocal cast including Gillian Anderson, Billy Crudup (as Ashitaka), Claire Danes (as San), Minnie Driver (as Lady Eboshi), Billy Bob Thornton, and Jada Pinkett Smith. They bring added nuance to a very different kind of magic kingdom.

{"description": "First-time director Karyn Kusama tells a simple but compelling story of a young woman in Brooklyn whose violent impulses in school, and her tendency to physicalize her anger, lead her to train as a boxer. Her trainer at first puts her off, but the combination of her desire and her physical prowess changes his mind. As played by Michelle Rodriguez, Diane is a scowling lightning rod for sudden violence who discovers that she can find a sense of personal grace in boxing--in the training and in the honing of skills--that seems to spill over into her daily life, despite the disapproval of an abusive father. Kusama isn't telling a new story here, but she tells a familiar one with a sense of passion and pride in the uncharted territory this represents for women. Though a romantic subplot seems almost tacked on as an afterthought--Diane must box the boy she loves--Girlfightis engaging and even touching.-Marshall Fine", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 586725}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.4, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXNX", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/418YTH268HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Girlfight [VHS]"}

{"description": "To callPearl Harbora throwback to old-time war movies is something of an understatement. Director Michael Bay's epic take on the bombing that brought the United States into World War II hijacks every war movie situation and clich&#xE9; (some affectionate, some stale) you've ever seen and gives them a shiny, glossy spin until the whole movie practically gleams. Planes glisten, water sparkles, trees beckon--and Bay's re-creation of the bombing itself, a 30-minute sequence that's tightly choreographed and amazingly photographed, sets the action movie bar up quite a few notches. And in updating the classic war film, Bay and screenwriter Randall Wallace (Braveheart) use that old plot standby, the love triangle--this time, it's between two pilots (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) and a nurse (Kate Beckinsale) who find themselves stationed at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, during what they thought would be a nice, sunny tour of duty. Then, of course, history intervened.For the first 90 minutes of the movie, Affleck and Beckinsale find a nice, appealing chemistry that plays on his strengths as a movie star and hers as a serious actress--he gives her glamour, she gives him smarts. Their truncated romance--the beginning of which is told in flashback so we can get right to the point where he has to leave her to go to England--works, thanks to their charm. They're no Kate and Leo fromTitanic(a strategy the film strives hard toward), but they're pretty darn adorable in their own right. Hartnett, as the not entirely unwelcome third wheel, squints bravely but makes only a slight dent in the film. Everyone else inPearl Harbor--from Cuba Gooding Jr.'s brave navy seaman to Jon Voight's able impersonation of FDR--is pretty much a glorified walk-on, taking a backseat to the pyrotechnics and action sequences that keep the three-hour film in fairly constant motion. But when that action does take hold,Pearl Harboris quite a thrilling ride.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792151712", "B000059HGY", "B00000K3AN", "B00AEBBA36", "0792133153", "079212569X", "6305169187", "6301734734", "0792147618", "0792116887", "6304618344", "079213690X", "6303269834", "6304925131", "6305718792", "6304259131", "B00004WIDB", "6304935811", "6303057225", "6304143184", "6302250269"], "bought_together": ["B00000K3AN", "B00AEBBA36"], "also_viewed": ["B00000G3PA", "0792151712", "6300213668", "B00000JS61", "6303215734", "6303402348", "B00004WIDB", "079213690X", "6305750750", "B004751DFU", "B00005O893", "B00000K3AN", "6301792734", "B00E5I2MCM", "6305169187", "B00007LVCM", "B007SPPANM", "B00L4K3MLE", "B00FLML7HW", "B008QZ5PY2", "B00JBGWP3Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 234413}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.49, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXTF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HC1ZDJN6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]"}
{"description": "If you want to laugh and enjoy yourself, I recommend Bring It On. With a superb cast, catchy lines, and a fully developed plot, this movie is great! Kirsten Dunst stars as Torrance Shipman, the ditzy but loveable high school senior who is newly elected team captain of her high school cheerleading team. But when a replacement cheerleader, Missy Pantone, walks in to the Toros' cheerleading squad (hilariously portrayed by Eliza Dushku), she shows Torrance that the team's cheers are ripped off from the East Compton Clovers, and you can believe that the Clovers are fed up with the stealing. Torrance, horrified that her cheerleading career has been a fake, makes an effort to be original, but the result is a humiliating performance at a competition. Torrance is comforted by love interest Cliff Pantone (played by hottie Jesse Bradford), Missy's REALLY cute twin brother, and a romance begins. As the movie leads up to the UCA Nationals competition, the Clovers and Toros fight for the win. Who will it be? Well you better watch it for yourself. Bring It On is a refreshing change from the immature sick sex movies and it instead is fresh, bright, witty, and very funny. I recommend Bring It On to anyone.", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B000WC39KE", "6304434340", "B003QZSWU6"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 424035}, "asin": "B00003CXMO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VN6MTN3AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bring It on [VHS]"}

Allen plays Ray Winkler, a low-brow con man who is married to Frenchy (Tracy Ullman), a former stripper. Ray and his buddies concoct a scheme to rob a bank by digging a tunnel from a defunct pizza place next door; as a cover, Frenchy opens a cookie shop in the storefront while Ray and company dig in the back. Ray's burglary is a failure, but Frenchy's cookies are a rousing success, and within a year the store has spawned a nationwide franchise that makes the Winklers rich. However, while Ray wants to move to Miami and bask in the sun, nouveau riche Frenchy now aspires to join high society, with posh art dealer David (Hugh Grant) as her guide.

The first disc has no extras but is packed with four separate Dolby Digital 5.1 tracks and is THX certified. The second disc holds four features, including a standard making-of featurette (15 minutes long) and a nifty segment that allows viewers to compare the storyboards to the final film and separate the music and sound effects in the train station sequence. More satisfying is the 20-minute short on the state of comic books, featuring revealing comments from critics and authors including Frank Miller (of the touchstoneDark Knightseries).

{"description": "In the first season ofThe X-Files, creator Chris Carter was uncertain of the series' future, so each of the episodes is a self-contained suspense story; they do not delve deep into the ongoing X-Files mythology or turn to self-parody and humor as do episodes in later seasons. Yet, these episodes display the elements for which the show would become famous: the cinematic production values and top-notch special effects, the stark lighting of the Vancouver sets, the atmospheric halo of Mark Snow's score, and the clever plots dealing with subjects ranging from the occult, religion, and monsters to urban legends, conspiracy theories, and science fiction. Most importantly, season&nbsp;1 introduces FBI agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Fox \"Spooky\" Mulder (David Duchovny), two of the most attractive government officials around. Scully is the serious-minded medical scientist assigned to join Mulder on the X-Files, a division of the FBI dealing with the paranormal. Mulder is the intuitive thinker with a dry wit, a passionate believer in the existence of paranormal phenomena and one of the few characters on television smart enough to figure out who the bad guy is before the audience does. Their muddled relationship, a deep friendship laced with sexual tension, provides the human heart in a world where the bizarre and horrible lurk in everyday society.The materials on the bonus disc provide some interesting trivia and background, but it is the 24 episodes themselves that make this seven-disc boxed set a true find. Those unfamiliar withThe X-Filesoften view all the fuss with the same skepticism with which Scully first regards her new partner's ideas. But just as she comes to realize the uncanny accuracy of Mulder's outlandish theories, newcomers toThe X-Fileswho sample a few episodes in this boxed set will likely find themselves riveted to their television late into the night. And undoubtedly, the shadows and creaking noises in the house that evening will seem more menacing than usual.--Eugene Wei", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BOH98G", "B000BOH990", "B000CNE0SS", "B000CNE0T2", "B000CNE0TC", "B000EXDS34", "B000EXDS3E", "B000EXDS3Y", "B0007X7044", "B001G7PSZI", "B001FACH7S", "B0006UEVUE", "B001CY5N00", "B00005JA9M", "B0007ZEO7I", "B000002N3A", "B00CRVL5ZE", "B002GP7ZVY", "B00FXW9664", "B002GP7ZVO", "B000083C6V", "B00003CXIS", "B001G7PSSK", "B003V1IU3O", "B000ATQYWY", "B004X60QE2", "B000244E2O", "B0030E5PYO", "B002GP7ZV4", "B000NDEXK2", "B002ZCY872", "0792839056", "B0012CJQYG", "B0002I848K", "B000EBGFPY", "B000UX6THK", "B001C4CI8U", "B00BTYNXJG", "B00005JNOG", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B006BZ8NSE", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00465I156", "B000R7GKQE", "B0002PYS7Y", "B000F8O2Q0", "B000F8O2PQ", "B00466H3CW", "B0009X76XW", "B001T21R5U", "B00005Y1NF", "B000AQ68Z0", "B001BSBBGC", "B000063V8R", "B000BGR1B4", "B007C8RZQ0", "B002BWP2IK", "B0058JEHTS", "B002GP7ZW8", "B000667HBS", "B00DNUSFZQ", "B00CDAG0WW", "B00AEBB9AK", "B000FOPPBA", "B000056T4I", "B001FB4W0C", "B001KOFH2G", "B002JVWRAO", "B0009NZ2RE", "B004QOB8TS", "B000AJJNI6", "B0002ERWVE", "B00BM2JVAA", "0790742012", "B000VDDDY6", "B000F8O2OW", "B00HR2HTRQ", "B004YM6JI2", "B00005JNEQ", "B00003CXZ4", "B000FJH5M2", "B001MVWRNE", "0783225725", "B000EXDS7K", "B00019074O", "B000JLTRHW", "B003BNO9GO", "B001G0MFIS", "B0032JTV6A", "B000FIMG68", "B004LROMWU", "B00008972G", "B001DMVZJ4", "B0011UF79M", "B005FISBTO", "B001715A92", "B000P6YNSE", "B00009PY45", "B00BYNL8DU", "B008B4KVRE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00CRVL5ZE", "B000BOH990", "B000BOH98G", "B0007X7044"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 170142}, "asin": "B00003RQND", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G8JY0Q71L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The X-Files - The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "Physician and best-selling author Deepak Chopra addresses a rapt  audience on what he considers seven simple yet powerful principles on how an individual can develop the attitude to attain success. Beginning by defining success in various ways, Chopra's language tends toward phrases such as \"success is the progressive expansion of the state of happiness.\"  Referring to a diagram that illustrates relationships between concepts such as \"pure potentiality\" and \"energy fields,\" Chopra moves onto explaining his \"seven spiritual laws\" and how they govern the \"spontaneous flow of intelligence.\" The various laws, including \"Karma\" and \"Detachment,\" are all given a thorough and often entertaining explanation.  While some might ridicule Chopra as a New Age charlatan, his lecture is presented in an earnest and coherent manner, and he often tosses in literary and scientific references as well as simple examples of common sense to back up his statements. A second feature,The Crystal Cave: Lessons from the Teachings of Merlin, is also included on this DVD.  Martin Sheen as Arthur, Robert Guillaume as Merlin, and Johanna Cassidy as the narrator give a dramatic reading designed to teach the audience to \"summon the inner wizard.\"--Robert J.

{"description": "If you've seenScreamandI Know What You Did Last Summer, then you know the entire plot ofScary Movie. That's okay, though, because this is a parody, and it helps to know the story in order to be able to get the jokes. No, the biggest surprise here is not the  story as much as the amount of full-frontal male nudity. Really, in addition to all the dick jokes (and the ass jokes and fart jokes), there's a couple of shots of the male member, one of which is erect and used as a weapon.Scary Moviesomehow ended up with an R rating, which in a sense is groundbreaking; perhaps our ratings board is loosening up after all.But is it funny? That's the most important question, and the answer to that is yes. In the vein ofAirplane!, with a dash of the Farrelly brothers,Scary Moviekeeps throwing jokes at you one after another. The law of averages says some of them have to hit, and enough of them do to keep the movie entertaining. Unlike the makers ofAirplane!, however, the Wayans brothers aren't making this movie out of a love of the genre, and unlike the Farrelly brothers, they don't make fun of retarded people with any sort of respect, so the humor throughout feels a lot uglier. Still, there are enough funny scenes inScary Movieto make the viewing experience worthwhile.

{"description": "Adventure movies are hard to come by these days--they've been replaced by action movies, which favor fast cars and big explosions over the dangers of nature and explorations of human character.Breakheart Passstars Charles Bronson as a mysterious petty criminal on the Western frontier. After being caught cheating at cards, he's arrested and held on a military transport train heading through the Rocky Mountains toward a fort on the coast, a fort stricken with diphtheria and in desperate need of the medical supplies on the train. But there's a conspiracy afoot--people on the train keep getting killed or disappearing--and the situation at the fort isn't what it seems either. Alistair MacLean adapted the screenplay from his own novel, and it's a well-plotted, efficient piece of work, made more compelling by a cast of solid character actors, ranging from Charles Durning (The Sting,Tootsie), Richard Crenna (Body Heat), and Ben Johnson (Oscar winner forThe Last Picture Show) to guys whose faces you'll recognize, even if their names don't sound familiar.Breakheart Passisn'tThe Treasure of the Sierra Madre, and Bronson isn't Humphrey Bogart, but the movie is a lean adventure flick with an outstanding score by Jerry Goldsmith.

{"description": "They get drunk on sour milk. They have two hearts and bald,  spotted heads. They're highly intelligent, but if you drop them in  seawater they'll melt into a puddle of goop. They're \"Newcomers,\" and  they arrived as refugees in a massive alien slave-ship, quarantined for  three years and then reluctantly accepted as citizens of Earth. To some  humans--including seasoned Los Angeles cop Matt Sykes (James Caan)--the  Newcomers are unwelcome \"slags.\" Sykes's own virulent \"speciesism\"  intensifies when Newcomer thugs kill his partner, but he sees logic in  teaming up with Sam Francisco (Mandy Patinkin), the first Newcomer  detective in the LAPD. Francisco's Newcomer knowledge is vital to their  investigation of an alien drug ring, and a friendship grows from  life-or-death circumstances.A routine cop thriller with a comedic sci-fi twist,Alien  Nation>has two things working in its favor: Caan and Patinkin form  a memorable duo, and the basic premise--as conceived by Rockne S.  O'Bannon (who later developed the film as a TV series)--intelligently  accounts for the sociological impact of an alien population. The subtle  point is made that humans are extraordinary beings who squander their  potential, and the evil of drugs--as dealt by a social-climbing  Newcomer played by Terence Stamp--leads to a crisis that threatens to  generate global intolerance. These points are well presented in a  context of overly familiar plotting and standard-issue sarcasm. It's  entertaining for a brisk 90 minutes, but in its attempt to be widely  appealing,Alien Nationglosses over issues that might have made  it more uniquely provocative.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BOH8Y6", "B000WLU5ZM", "B000QXDCJ2", "0780628586", "B000067FP2", "B00005B8UD", "B00023BKMC", "B0019BI1DM", "B00F3L8P26", "B001RHGRTS", "6305869103", "0792839684", "B0002MHDW4", "B00JL6L4UY", "B0009JE6G6", "B00453QOC6", "B00005O5B5", "B000W4KT9G", "B0045HCJKS", "0767812166", "B001BGS17Q", "B00K7IPFSM", "B00AEBB8VK", "B000ELL1QC", "B000092Q4V", "B003H9LIU2", "B00004Y87O", "B0045HCJSA", "B00BTYPW7C", "B003R0MEYA", "B0011367SY", "B00IWTVDUW", "B0045HCJT4", "B002U0KHME", "B0009S4IF6", "B00404ME2E", "0792838947", "B00HFWETZ8", "B000JLTRHW", "B0000DZTIL", "6305258287", "B003Y7JWZ0", "B001A7GOCA", "B000CEXFYW", "B00008L3UQ", "B0039A9MES", "0792838300", "B0041B77RS", "B00005JOJE", "B002GHHHOM", "B003YCL0Y6", "B000PHX8RA", "B002SJIO4A", "B0013LL2Z2", "B00HRUQB8Q", "B0007CEXUY", "B00H3N3UV8", "B00HT2RTU6", "B00CPTUNZG", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B0000AOX0F", "1558908846", "B00ARWX9NG", "B005FQ2H8W", "B000KGGIV4", "B0045HCJSU", "B00004STDN", "B00AEBB91E", "B001AQMBNC", "B00GX7D5G0", "B002BAW6H2", "B0009X768W", "B0001Z37HM", "B001JFZ118", "B00008G8LY", "B00061QJSK", "B0072GPQ8G", "B009INADRA", "B0001I562I", "B004KPLVV8", "B002BAW6GI", "B00JJOY45U", "B00AEFXIIW", "B0003JAOO0", "B00GJ7CUFG", "B006MFQ4OS", "B00JGR3M80", "B00J4LMHMK", "B0045HCJGC", "B000068MC3", "B00A50PDS4", "B00AZMFJYA", "B002BAW6FY", "B00HXH00YE", "B008L0YMVE", "B0045HCJG2", "B004EXWGHY", "0783229399", "0783232047", "B00003CWU3"], "bought_together": ["B000BOH8Y6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BOH8Y6", "B000KGGIV4", "B000WLU5ZM", "B000QXDCJ2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 249993}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 25.98, "brand": "", "asin": "B000059HAD", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5162DB53QTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Alien Nation"}
{"description": "It's a good thing Sandra Bullock knows her strengths and weaknesses, because without Bullock as star and producer,Miss Congenialitywould be an insufferable mess as opposed to being a mildly enjoyable trifle that is custom-made for Bullock's established screen persona. Only Bullock's fans could really appreciate this fluff (even then they'll wish its ripe premise had been more intelligently handled), but it's not without some highlights to accompany Bullock's reliable charms. Here she plays clumsy, nerdy FBI agent Gracie Hart, who is given the horrific pseudonym Gracie Lou Freebush (one example of the movie's juvenile tendencies) when assigned to infiltrate a beauty pageant to investigate threats of a terrorist attack.Transforming Bullock from frumpy to stunning is a piece of cake (although she gives pageant coach Michael Caine a run for his money), so the movie's premise is trivial at best. More enjoyable is her character's uncouth disdain for pageant contestants and her mistaken perception that they're all a bunch of bimbos. The movie nicely charts Gracie's realization that her own pageant makeover provides a much-needed ego boost. In addition to Caine's effortless scene-stealing, pageant host William Shatner and organizer Candice Bergen are smart choices for comedic support (Shatner's a perfect Bert Parks wannabe), but the movie desperately needs a credible foundation for its comedy to really pay off. Bullock's bureau boss (Benjamin Bratt) is an unconvincing dimwit, and none of the plotting is as smart as sayBeverly Hills Copin combining procedure with laughs. That leaves Bullock to carry the burden of a comedy that just barely works in her favor.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009KA2OA", "B00005O5CM", "B00005JM55", "6304765266", "B002K0WBXW", "B00081U7HC", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B00003CXSM", "B00006ZXSL", "B00008NRI7", "B002VECM6S", "B00007E2F5", "B0006GANOQ", "B00AEBB8NS", "B00003CXMP", "B0000524E5", "B00AEFY99O", "B00006FMUW", "B000HEWEE4", "B002NZK5V4", "B000YDBPAM", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00AEBB8R4", "B000CEV3M8", "B002O3Z50G", "B004SEUJK0", "B000J4QW7W", "B00E8RKHWW", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B00AEFYM2S", "B000209KMW", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00006ZXSK", "B0045HCJJ4", "B00447L4KA", "B00AMEZDJW", "B00008WJD6", "B0000897EG", "B000QUU4LY", "B000MQC9H4", "B00AEFXYOA", "B0000DIXDR", "B000XT1P3E", "0800177258", "0783225504", "B000NA1WE0", "6305236569", "B000023VTP", "B000FO0A9W", "B002SYAGNC", "B001ECDVK4", "B00003CXFV", "B00AEFYF2K", "B000J103OI", "B00005JG6N", "B0036TGSIK", "B00466HN7M", "B00000G3PA", "B0000AOV4I", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFY5TI", "B0015I2RT8", "B001ECDVJU", "B004SIP8JI", "B00005KAQP", "B000ELJAEM", "B0049TC88U", "B002NZK5UU", "B00006ZXSQ", "B00008G8M4", "B004SIP9RO", "6305212112", "B000A343RI", "B004SIP9X8", "0783225733", "6302077818", "B002GHHHP6", "B002GIBVWA", "B00AEBB9WI", "0800141806", "B000683VI4", "B00795C5X4", "B002NZK5RS", "B00003CXTA", "B000JYW5BE", "B00005JM9Q", "B004EPZ070", "B00AEFXZJE", "B003L20IHE", "B007L6VMDK", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00386EZKE", "B000CCBCAI", "B00007BKVC", "0783235070", "B00AEFXWXI", "B000CEV3KU", "B00005BCKF", "B00AEBB8YW", "B0006N2EZ0"], "bought_together": ["B00005O5CM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000NA1WE0", "B003PIUIJC", "6304765266", "B00005O5CM"]}, "price": 9.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 77252}, "asin": "B00005AAA9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514V9KPFJRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Miss Congeniality"}
{"description": "Ziad Doueiri established his credentials as the assistant  cameraman on Quentin Tarantino's early films, but his feature debut,West Beirut, belongs to the more European strain of  coming-of-age films than Tarantino's cool crime wave. Tarek is a rebellious  class clown and aspiring filmmaker, a restless Lebanese teenager who rails  against European colonialism with little acts of defiance at the French  High School of Beirut. It's 1975. Fighter jets ominously scream  overhead, soldier convoys rumble through the streets, and the tensions  that grip the city explode when a violent terrorist attack sinks Beirut  into civil war.Tarek, played by director Doueiri's younger brother Rami in a spirited,  charming performance, becomes Ziad's cinematic alter ego and a  spiritual cousin to Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut's Antoine Doinel. When a  military blockade splits the city in half, cutting Tarek and his  friends off from their school, the war zone becomes their playground.  Doueiri never slights the danger of their situation and fills the  background with telling detail (from snipers and booby traps to the  increasing racial and religious intolerance), but his heart is with the  adolescent adventure of his recklessly na&iuml;ve kids. He captures an  excitement and energetic curiosity only possible in the innocence of  youth as they dodge military patrols, sneak across checkpoints, shoot  their Super 8 movies, and fall in love in the shadow of war. Former  Police drummer Stewart Copeland provides a funky rhythmic score with a  Mideast inflection, easily one of his best.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 431923}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "West Beirut [VHS]", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B000BBOUDG"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R4EBC2V6L._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "B00005ALOX"}

{"description": "Septemberis best known as the movie Woody Allen made twice, bang on top of each other, and still brought in on time and on budget. He decided the casting wasn't working, switched some actors and roles, and altogether dumped Sam Shepard (who subsequently had very uncomplimentary things to say about Allen as a director of actors). That was some kind of achievement and said reams about Allen's efficiency and adaptability as a filmmaker. Unhappily, the congratulations end there, forSeptemberis the single most excruciating viewing experience the Woodman ever invited audiences to share.You could saySeptemberisInteriorswithout the laughs (joke: there are no laughs inInteriorseither), without the pull of the Hamptons shore outside the windows, and without the chill, elegant eye of Gordon Willis behind the camera. Members of a thoroughly unappealing family convene for a weekend in Vermont. Over the course of it, almost everybody reveals a lurking preference to have a new significant other in his or her life. You will not care who, how, or why, or acquire any insights into the mysteries of human relationships. Just as Maureen Stapleton brought the breath of life to the emotionally stunted mollusks inInteriors, so here Elaine Stritch injects some sting as Mia Farrow's irrepressibly bitchy mother.

{"description": "Heavy on atmosphere and light on everything else,From Hellis visually impressive while lacking the depth of the acclaimed graphic novel it's based upon. Making their third feature since 1993'sMenace II Society, twins Allen and Albert Hughes approach the Jack the Ripper case with physical precision, re-creating the gritty Whitechapel district of 1888 London in meticulous detail. What they've forgotten is the sheer terror that gripped Whitechapel in the wake of the Ripper's slaying of five prostitutes, investigated here by a Scotland Yard sleuth (Johnny Depp) who uses opium, laudanum, and absinthe to fuel his semiprescient visions of the slayings. Heather Graham attempts a slippery Cockney accent as a would-be victim, while Ian Holm steals the show as a has-been surgeon with devilish delusions of grandeur. Violence is obliquely suggested or briefly graphic, but no matter how you cut it,From Hellis only marginally thrilling as it treads familiar territory.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBBA72", "B000NQRR1Q", "B004P7CNC2", "B00005R87R", "B000F7CECK", "B00AEBBAEK", "B00000IRE6", "B002QEHPQU", "B0002234LS", "B008QE9XD2", "B0000VD04M", "B0009UZG0K", "0780621611", "B006ISJQ1W", "B004SIP7PS", "B0000AC8LI", "B00347AIOE", "B00003CXWV", "B003HKN52U", "B001HN69AY", "B000053VAZ", "B000TGJ80S", "B0012Q7M02", "B00AEBB9F0", "B002Q3MYA8", "B00C888MJ8", "B00004XPPB", "B000FDEV3Y", "0780628551", "0783229526", "B001HN694K", "B0000WN140", "B0009IOR6Q", "B00F84H73Q", "B00003CXRG", "B001GCUO0W", "B004A8ZWSS", "B004SIP6BI", "B00004W4UB", "B000N2HDJQ", "B000C3L27U", "B000GCFO0I", "B000BB1MI2", "B005S9EJ8W", "B0009XRZKQ", "B00AEBB89W", "B008R65Y28", "B001I04QCO", "B00008LUNW", "B00005JLKN", "B003Y5H54W", "B0012QE4Q2", "B00DZP1C2W", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00JPFTX5O", "B0000TPA0G", "B001AGXEAG", "B0041KKYEM", "B00J5JSV3A", "B000069I1I", "B002UOMH00", "B004SIP92O", "B001A50716", "B005LAIHYU", "B0002KVUKM", "B005COPWZW", "B0036BDQ7Y", "B000UJ48P4", "B004SIP7TE", "B0031U8OEK", "0783116934", "B005LAIHXQ", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B000063US5", "B00005JLQN", "B00DHD933W", "B002AF4Y9G", "B000LP6KNU", "B008JFUNYG", "B0021L8V34", "B001D2WU9I", "B007XF0W3K", "B003AWRMBU", "B00009MEKN", "B00HRCATDW", "B0020PFYHC", "B00003CXKM", "B004SUDQ4A", "B0010DR4BO", "B0097C046W", "B00IKM5LXG", "B000FAOC2W", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00K6D1RVW", "B002ZG97CO", "B00151QYXU", "B005LAIH2C", "6301971345", "6304712499", "B003H5WF3U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBBA72", "B004P7CNC2", "B00005R87R", "B000NQRR1Q"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 164982}, "asin": "B00005JKJM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/418JG1F78JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "From Hell (Two-Disc Special Edition)"}
{"description": "Antoine Fuqua (THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS, BAIT) turns up the intensity level with TRAINING DAY, a charged drama about police corruption in downtown Los Angeles. Ethan Hawke stars as Jake Hoyt, a well-intentioned young officer who thinks he's found his ticket to becoming a detective in the form of undercover officer Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Harris is a notorious figure in the streets and in the office. He also has the authority to make Jake's professional wishes come true, provided Jake is able to prove his worth on Alonzo's team. At first, Alonzo's blunt, carefree demeanor provides a shock to Jake's optimistic system, but as it becomes clear that Alonzo is dangerously out of control, Jake must decide whether or not to risk his future in the name of the law.\n\nWashington's performance as the evil, pragmatic detective is a sight to behold. He delivers his lines with a devilish ferocity that keeps the film bubbling throughout. Hawke slips into the role of the rookie everyman with ease, providing a good contrast to Washington's fiery presence. Former video director Fuqua completes the picture by casting musicians Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and Macy Gray in supporting roles.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792841778", "630268644X", "6303012140", "6300214826"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 428216}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.0, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005JKEC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/415AYTB1GNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Training Day [VHS]"}

{"description": "The plethora of extras on this two-disc set are worth your time. There are several well-produced segments on the physical aspects of the film highlighted by a tour of the vast Cinecitt&#xE0; Studio sets with director Martin Scorsese and production designer Dante Ferretti (with a 360-degree-view feature to boot). Historian Luc Sante introduces you to the Five Corners area in New York circa the mid-19th century, and there's a vintage vocabulary guide (from the 1859 edition ofThe Rogue's Lexicon). Even though it was made as a \"puff piece\" for the movie, the Discovery Channel show \"Uncovering the Real Gangs of New York\" is an informative half-hour on the film's historical background. There's another espresso double-shot from a Scorsese commentary track. Not recorded traditionally as he watches the movie, the track pieces together thoughts from the director including some recorded in an NPR interview. This allows Scorsese to be even more focused, dealing with the history of the time and his own 30-year struggle to make the film. One serious demerit for stretching the feature film over both discs, which most likely had to be done with having both Dolby 5.1 and DTS tracks along with the commentary on the long film.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000M341QE", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00080ZG10", "B00AEBB8NI", "B006OFN0SE", "B00005JLSB", "B000C20VPA", "B000MZHW40", "B001N44BVQ", "B002ZG980U", "B000P0J09M", "B00049QQHI", "B004SIP8ZM", "0767830555", "6305313687", "B0006GAOJA", "B00008975Z", "B0016Q2D66", "B0000DI87S", "B00008DP4C", "B00011CZRE", "B000P0J0EW", "B00004XPPB", "B008R65XYC", "B005LAIIJY", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000C20VRS", "B004SIP95G", "B000286RP2", "B002CPMB9O", "B002T9H2LA", "0307388980", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000A7DVR2", "B00AEFXKUI", "B008MILL8W", "B00AEBB9F0", "B001EZE5DI", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004FQX5B6", "B002QEHPQU", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00H9KKGTO", "B004SIP6GI", "B002VWNIEA", "B0001FGBUW", "B000A2UBN4", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00003CWM3", "B008D1Q1VA", "B00005V9HH", "B003ASLJQI", "B003ASLJQS", "B007SPPANM", "B000093FLA", "B00003CXZ4", "B00004XPPG", "B00001ZWUS", "B000H5TH20", "B000FKO5QK", "B002ZG99N6", "6304711905", "B0018CMJSU", "0767817710", "B009AMANBA", "079284646X", "B000FS9FCG", "B000065U1N", "B00AEBB89W", "B000P0J0AG", "B004SIP6QI", "B001QTXM5Y", "B004499LWG", "0783227906", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000J4P9P8", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00AEBB95K", "B000NOKFHQ", "B002VWNICC", "B00009W5CA", "B004U7MR14", "B004AOECXI", "B00003CXRM", "0783231202", "B000069HZP", "0783229526", "B001JIE7JC", "B00005221M", "B000N6TX1I", "B00005JMJG", "B000N3SRO0", "B00003CXWV", "B00005JMYI", "B003HKN52U", "0790732238", "B00004U103", "B003UESJHO", "B000P0J09C"], "bought_together": ["B000M341QE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002ZG980U", "B000P0J09M", "B0013FXWU6", "B00H9KKGTO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 46244}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.89, "brand": "Miramax", "asin": "B00005JKN9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516W0haa4aL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gangs of New York (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}

TALK TO HER is the surprising, altogether original and quietly moving story of the spoken and unspoken bonds that unite the lives and loves of two couples. Two men (Benigno and Marco) almost meet while watching a dance performance, but their lives are irrevocably entwined by fate.

{"description": "Fill a bowl with alpine strawberries, break out the Ch&acirc;teau Lafite (1899, of course), and bask in this benchmark 1981 British miniseries based on Evelyn Waugh's classic novel. Adapted for the screen by John Mortimer (Rumpole of the Bailey), this impeccable, nearly 11-hour production mesmerized American viewers during the course of its PBS run in 1982. In his breakthrough role, Jeremy Irons stars as Charles Ryder, a disillusioned Army captain who is moved to reflect on his \"languid days\" in the \"enchanted castle\" that was Brideshead, home of the aristocratic Marchmain family, whose acquaintance Charles made in the company of an Oxford classmate, the charming wild child Sebastian. Anthony Andrews costars as the doomed Sebastian, whose beauty is \"arresting\" and \"whose eccentricities and behavior seemed to know no bounds.\" The \"entitled and enchanted\" Sebastian takes Charles under his wing (\"Charles, what a lot you have to learn\"), but vows early on that he is \"not going to let [Charles] get mixed up with [his] family.\" But mixed up Charles gets. He becomes a friend and confidante, not to mention a lover, to Sebastian's sister Julia (Diana Quick). Meanwhile, the self-destructive Sebastian's life spirals out of control.Brideshead Revisitedboasts a distinguished ensemble, including Laurence Olivier in his Emmy Award-winning role as the exiled Lord Marchmain, Claire Bloom as Lady Marchmain, and the magnificent John Gielgud as Charles's estranged father. Grand locations and a haunting musical score make this a memorable revisit of an irretrievable bygone era. For those who scheduled their weeks around the original Monday-night broadcasts or those visitingBridesheadfor the first time, this boxed set release will be, as Charles rhapsodizes at one point while strolling the castle grounds, \"very near to heaven.\"--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001AXL67W", "B006JY3OHW", "B004H0ZHD4", "B00DW5ILF6", "B005GRF2ZU", "B00007149J", "B0083HXKMC", "B008UQUS26", "B009L2EW5W", "0316216453", "B00065GX96", "B00F1BFRA6", "B000056KMW", "B000GYI3D6", "B00EF0NVGQ", "B0054DPLHK", "B0080QOL10", "B00BQXTDIU", "B004JMSIQS", "B0028AEO0M", "0316216445", "B00HUAH14Q", "B0013NAMLK", "B00003CXC9", "B003WEAVZK", "B005X5XIMO", "B00005JOA0", "B004499LWG", "B001B1Q2UO", "0060881305", "B00005V5NU", "B000FQIRXQ", "B004SI5VUO", "B002XTBECY", "B003YCI1UC", "B008KEQLW4", "B0001DCYUU", "B0009PVZIW", "B0007LFPJ8", "B0009PVZL4", "B000E0ODZE", "B007701RFS", "B00BGARGR8", "B000EDWLTQ", "B009Z59ZNE", "B00BOTCJXC", "0060881313", "B00FPPQYXM", "B0074FUSFG", "B001V7UXG2", "B001PU8N0I", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00HUAGZ34", "B003X2P9B2", "B00B62R9XM", "B0006Z2NAY", "B000784WNQ", "B00023BKO0", "B000M2E32M", "B004JMSIVI", "B004N66XYE", "B000A8AXXG", "B00ANGICCO", "B008PDAENC", "B003WEAW18", "B0007WRT4Q", "B00JLDTBCU", "B0002S648C", "B0009PVZM8", "B001P807RC", "B0012IV3Q4", "B008BF7TBY", "B00D3PYQT0", "B00JKEM36Q", "B000006UQ9", "B0038M2SAW", "B000I2J6WI", "B00D2UMHPG", "B00D2UMHIS", "B00005JKNF", "B004H0ZH20", "B00DUX28XQ", "B00EBBGKTE", "B00005R5GB", "B00003JRCQ", "B002TY78PU", "B0001WTUK8", "B009T6CXG0", "B00DQN6IOK", "B001B3LIPG", "B000S2B23E", "B005DJ7AYC", "B00E320W8Q", "B0011VJRVU", "B00A27O0N4", "B00HGE90Z4", "0316926051", "B000UJ48SQ", "B0099Y2MYK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005GRF2ZU", "0316216453", "B006JY3OHW", "B004H0ZHD4"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 213297}, "asin": "B00005JLG2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51T8PA0H0KL._SX300_.jpg", "title": "Brideshead Revisited"}

{"description": "Such a simple idea--yet so fiendishly complex in the execution.24, as surely everyone knows by now, is a thriller that takes places over 24 hours, midnight to midnight, in 24 one-hour episodes (well, 45-minute episodes if you subtract the commercials). Everything takes place in real time, which means no flashbacks, no flash-forwards, no handy time-dissolves. Every strand of the plot has to be dovetailed and interlocked so things happen just when they should, in the right amount of time. Not that easy.Creator Robert Cochran and his team of writers and directors have done an impressive job of putting the jigsaw together and keeping the tension ratcheted up high, as federal agent Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) runs around L.A. trying to stall an assassination attempt on an African American presidential candidate and rescue his wife and daughter from the clutches of the Balkan baddies. Twists, turns, revelations, and cliffhangers are tossed at us with satisfying regularity. It's not perfect: we get some hokey plot devices (instant amnesia, anybody?); the final twist makes no sense whatsoever; there are altogether too many huggy family moments; and as for Dennis Hopper's \"Serbian\" accent....Even so, this is undeniably mold-breaking TV. Sutherland, rescuing his career from the doldrums in one heroic leap, fully deserves his Golden Globe. Sets and locations are artfully deployed, and Sean Callery's score is a powerful, brooding presence. LikeMurder OneandThe Sopranos,24is one of those series that future TV thrillers will be measured against.--Philip Kemp", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008YGRU", "B0002XVQSU", "B000B837XI", "B000ICLRKC", "B000MR8W92", "B001L5SRJE", "B002ZCY7SW", "B000NDEXKW", "B001DMVZOE", "B002ZCY7TG", "B0015QWZ8S", "B0001WHXM0", "B001QE99AQ", "B009LDD1H6", "B000VWC9YW", "B001DJLCRC", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B0075FF5QM", "B000RO6JY0", "B001934SNM", "B0015RRNMA", "B00005JOC9", "B000R9YLKY", "B003145HQY", "B00005JNOG", "B00J5LXT44", "B00KPP6R9S", "B0053O8AKU", "B000Q6GUW0", "B000YABIQ6", "B0044E9JU0", "B00HW3EXCE", "B009MF5BXK", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00BW4S8AC", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B00JL6L4UY", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B00HX0KIAM", "B008CLI4N4", "B000W91RUG", "0553397737", "B00KDK64DY", "B00AIBZMM2"], "bought_together": ["B00008YGRU", "B0002XVQSU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0044E9JU0", "B00008YGRU", "B0002XVQSU", "B00LDCGBNE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18292}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.38, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B00005JLF2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41PB6M8MGRL._SX300_.jpg", "title": "24: Season 1"}

{"description": "It's not that the folks at Pixar are geniuses when it comes to DVDs... well, come to think of it, their fifth DVD set shows these folks are wizards. It's not just that the two discs are packed with watchable extras that hardly reiterate the same information; it's how they are handled--funny, inventive, with a light touch--unlike many PR-driven discs. A good place to start is the filmmakers' jolly commentary track, which branches off into 31 minutes of behind-the-scene stuff, deleted scenes, and curious anecdotes (they can also be watched separately). Pixar's first making-of documentary is a most concise and interesting 25-minute examination that also sheds light on how the company works. With a digital-to-digital transfer, the film looks great and is available in widescreen or reformatted to full screen. The \"Family Fun\" disc includes another Pixar made-for-the-DVD gem, the 7-minute \"Exploring the Reef\" with Jean-Michel Cousteau (Jacques's son) being upstaged by Dori and Marlin; it's a hoot and teaches a fact or two you will remember about reefs. Both discs feature lovely menus that can be turned into virtual aquariums for your TV (by removing the text) featuring the knockout colors of the film's settings. Watch long enough for some shenanigans from the film's characters and vocal talent. Genius, pure genius.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00EV1YZ96", "B00AFEX83C", "B00007LVCM", "B00005JNS0", "B0030IIZ4M", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B003ZHVJGO", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00003CXB4", "B001KVZ6FW", "B0013FSL3E", "B004HO6I4M", "B00005JN4W", "B000MV9026", "B004G600A4", "B000AY74OG", "B000VBJEEG", "B0006UEVT0", "B008YWY0HK", "B003H9M1Q2", "B00CQRN3QI", "B0001I561E", "B0042U94UQ", "B00E9ZATJO", "B000YERP2S", "B0006JMLRK", "B000AAF1TU", "B0000AOX0O", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00F522C7C", "B0039N74CW", "B00003CXCQ", "B001ILFUDC", "B00275EHJG", "B001HN6922", "0736429220", "B000B8QG4A", "B000RMJ4F8", "B0084IHVN4", "B002ZG97YM", "B001ECQ75A", "B004ZBACOE", "B0030IIYYS", "B0084IHVGG", "B00E9ZATKI", "B00AO686JC", "B000GUJZ00", "B00004R99S", "B0012EM5D8", "B0084IHVUC", "B0013ND30M", "B0034JKZ86", "B0000VV4W2", "B00003CX8Y", "B008JFUQ16", "B001DPHDCY", "B00005TN8K", "B00CUDD0C0", "B00A83075M", "B001O5LVPI", "B001NCDFTW", "B00G7TIKMI", "B0000E32WJ", "B00CWM58WY", "B001ILFUD2", "B00009YXAW", "B00CMY3JBO", "B00335EQ0E", "B005LAIISA", "0783231474", "B0002YLCOM", "B00E00OGE2", "B000H7JCK0", "B000UVKGPI", "B00005JMQZ", "B00JK531ES", "B00004U9WQ", "B005LAIH4A", "B005LAIHW2", "B00024I2Z4", "B00I6JOD2S", "B008NNY9QW", "B0000VCZKM", "B00FE8BVF6", "6302526574", "B004EPZ034", "B000L22SG6", "B001OMU6UM", "B00E56D8FO", "B0000524D0", "B002WJI2QQ", "B0009CTT6U", "B000050MN3", "B000B8QG3G", "B0058AFS0O", "B00006FDAI", "B00EGIAQ1K", "B000A7G4TY"], "bought_together": ["B00EV1YZ96", "B00G5G7EXY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00EV1YZ96", "B00AFEX83C", "B00I6JOD2S", "B004HO6I4M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7746}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 25.5, "brand": "Disney", "asin": "B00005JM02", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-difUGanL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "James Bond DVDs have in general been pretty loaded, butDie Another Dayraises the bar with a two-disc set featuring dynamic DTS 6.1 ES and Dolby Digital 5.1 EX sound that makes good use of the rear speakers. The first commentary track is by Pierce Brosnan and Rosamund Pike (who plays villain Miranda Frost). They weren't together at the time, so their comments are spliced into one track. Brosnan has a good time watching and is proud of the film but also doesn't take himself too seriously (\"They don't teach you this stuff at drama school: 'OK, now you're going to be electrocuted by the bad guy.'\"). Self-proclaimed \"Bond novice\" Pike also is proud of the film and says she's annoyed by people who question whether there's still a need for Bond. On the second commentary track, director Lee Tamahori and producer Michael G. Wilson chat about topics as diverse as casting, Bond lore, and product placements. For more Bond lore, don't overlook the trivia track, which offers pop-up tidbits about the filming and tips on the inside jokes.The centerpiece of the second disc is the 80-minute \"InsideDie Another Day\" documentary, which is a set of featurettes strung together. Topics include the opening surfing sequence; the scenes set in North Korea and Cuba (including Halle Berry's bikini tribute to Ursula Andress); the ice palace; post-production elements such as computer graphics, editing, and music; the car battle (finding strong ice was the key safety issue); and the passing of the \"Q\" torch from Desmond Llewellyn to John Cleese.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000NIBURQ", "B000M53GM2", "B000RPCK1U", "B000NDEXPM", "B000M53GMW", "B000RPCK1K", "B000RPCK24", "B000NIBURG", "B000M53GLS", "B000RPCK1A", "B000NIBUR6", "B000M53GN6", "B001PPLIEG", "B001R10BN2", "B00AQSN7HE", "B000RPCK0Q", "B000M53GNG", "B000NIBUS0", "B000NDEXPC", "B00004RG62", "B000M53GMC", "B007REV4T8", "B00004WEJZ", "B00005JL0I", "B009PN18R2", "B008YAPQX4", "B004BR7XLM", "B009PN3OD8", "B003QO8TOQ", "B000HRMAPE", "B000VNMMR0", "B0000BYRO7", "B00AZFECL8", "B000EGDB10", "B004EPYZUS", "B0004Z33EQ", "B00AIBZMD6", "B009A87Z6U", "B009RO9LKK", "B000SK5Z70", "B00003CXMV", "6305657947", "B00005JLYW", "B00005JN2Z", "B00023B1LC", "B005PTYP70", "B00008G8M4", "B00005JNJV", "B00000G3PA", "B000P0J06K", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B002ZG9864", "0792844068", "B00005JKIP", "0792166736", "0790732238", "B00AS1Q93S", "B003Q6D2B4", "B0002I84N0", "B000U1ZV8K", "B008JFURII", "B00JA3RVG4", "B000MZHW40", "B00026ZG10", "0790732149", "B000FKO3HG", "B000AP04FG", "B008JFUS0U", "B0001FGC1U", "B00005JMQW", "B009L6UDUG", "B00AVWIQZS", "B0013BM63O", "B00005JLRT", "B00E5I2M6I", "B001TK80C0", "B00AZMFJYA", "B0007KZQAM", "B002ZG999U", "B00BUAEYVK", "B009A87ZQU", "B000P0J06U", "B008JFUO72", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00003CY0V", "B00E5I2MCM", "B0036TGSR6", "B003AWRMBU", "B0000BYRO9", "B008JFUNHI", "B00177YA1K", "6304696221", "B0021L8V0M", "B00006G8FD", "B000UR9T8C", "B002GNOSFM", "B003UESJFQ", "B0006L0LOS", "B000AYELVU"], "bought_together": ["B000NIBURQ", "B000M53GM2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000M53GM2", "B000RPCK1U", "B000M53GN6", "B000RPCK0Q"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 38500}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "MGM", "asin": "B00005JLBE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51kgPWMuVFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Die Another Day (Widescreen Special Edition)"}
{"description": "There's only one deleted scene in this two-disc DVD set, but it's a doozy. The \"Sgt. Candy Scene\" is a must-see and, unfortunately, the best thing on the second disc. The rushed HBO documentary shows us far more flash than substance. Better is the Visual Effects Lab that goes more in-depth with four sequences, although you need to wade through a hokey interface for each segment. Making your \"own\" effects isn't that much fun; you can only choose a few effects that change in two scenes. Anyone looking to get the complicated backstory of the trilogy figured out should dig into the \"Sky Net Database\" and an intricate timeline. The two commentary tracks are worth a listen, with director Jonathan Mostow's solo track the better one. The director goes into great detail on how the little things (from lighting street scenes to tricks for destroying buildings) count.  The second track is pieced together from the actors recorded separately. Mostow appears with actress Claire Danes (doing her first commentary track) and their chemistry is enjoyable after a slow start. The other actors have less interesting things to say, including Schwarzenegger who is constantly--yet enthusiastically--selling the film.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5", "B001FB55HQ", "B00005JA8B", "B00070FX5U", "B00007AJG4", "B002ZG98LO", "B000T9OP7G", "B002GHHHME", "B00005JKIP", "B002QFYJFY", "B0002J58HO", "B0000AXE8I", "B001AQO43M", "B00AKGG828", "B00026ZG10", "B0001BKAEY", "B00IZZDWKM", "B001451HXO", "B0000VCZK2", "B000056PMU", "B000BPL2FQ", "B000RW3VCK", "B0004Z33F0", "B000U1ZV8K", "B0045HCJGC", "B0004Z33EQ", "B00005JNTU", "B000HRMAPE", "B00008G8M4", "B000RRS7RE", "B00005JKYX", "B0000VD12I", "B000FC2FQA", "B00000ILDG", "B00000G3PA", "B00005JMZK", "B000MGBSE4", "B0087ZG7J8", "B0004Z33EG", "B000P0J0AQ", "B00005JMEW", "B0087ZG7NO", "B00003CXTA", "B0002CHK1S", "B000RJO56E", "B00177YA1K", "B00004STDN", "B005COLETU", "B001AK3S4Y", "B000VNMMR0", "B0000959N0", "B00005JMUA", "1558908846", "6305767866", "B001RIY4WE", "B0049IHX2C", "B000VI70QS", "B000EGDB10", "B002GSXKN8", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B0045HCJ9O", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00005JNJV", "B001451HX4", "B00I9TDMRM", "B0006GANOQ", "B00003CXSP", "6305428115", "B00016MSV2", "B00005JOC9", "B000TJBN80", "B009MO57H6", "B000O77SQS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B001OST0M6", "B005LAIHXQ", "B0002J4X1Q", "B0002V7OI8", "B0015XHP2C", "6304806434", "B000QXDED6", "B00005JL3K", "B008JFUPFI", "B003PIUINS", "0783225946", "0792839056", "B00005N7Z1", "B0006GAO6I", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00005JL78", "B001HN697M", "B00IJS2OXG", "B002NXSRVG", "B00008G8M5", "B00005JN0T", "B003XURDAY", "B000O77SRM", "B006VRRGNK", "B00F4FFO8E"], "bought_together": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5", "B001FB55HQ", "B002JT6AO0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 115564}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.47, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JM0B", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5143TFPX8SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}

Featuring Academy Award nominee Jennifer Tilly (as herself and the voice of Tiffany) and hip-hop star Redman, it's more gore, more gags, and much more Chucky doing his dirtiest deeds yet!", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783232039", "B0000AOX08", "0783230451", "B001B1UO6W", "B00DTPRZ10", "B0000AOX0H", "B0000D9PNG", "B000FWHW86", "B00AEFY37C", "B004AC6PMG", "B001NPD9LS", "B00AEFY31S", "B00AEFY2WI", "B00006FDBT", "B00AEFY2LO", "B0000VCZMK", "B000099T3M", "B004SIP9P6", "B0000CEB6Y", "B00006FI0R", "B000I2J68M", "B004LWZW2O", "B0000A02WB", "1573628174", "B004SIP9O2", "B00AEFY1V0", "B004SIP9MY", "B004EPZ08O", "B00AEFY2E6", "B005CM1ILQ", "0780630890", "B00006LPHA", "B001GCUO4S", "B00BM4Q4H6", "B00DTPRZ24", "B00DTPRZ0G", "B00005JMDZ", "0780630882", "B003L20IEW", "B00AEFY2AA", "B0000AOX09", "B0021L8UPS", "B00AEFYV9W", "B008G4T7W4", "B00018D42W", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B00105303S", "6305017115", "B00ECGIL9K", "B00005JPLQ", "B000RIWAVW", "B005CFBYW6", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00AIBZKV0", "B0033B5XCS", "B0053TWVDC", "B000GETUDI", "B0000E2R6P", "B004LWZW6K", "0780630874", "B0007WFX62", "B000KJU1KK", "B000FC2HS6", "B000GYI3B8", "B00006FDCD", "B000FS9FE4", "B005GT3X68", "B000A7LR9Q", "B006CXIKYC", "B00BEIYGT8", "B001FB55HQ", "B00JPS6A3O", "B00FR81Z40", "B001P3SA9Y", "B00HRCATDW", "B004P7CM9Q", "B000FA57US", "B00DTPRYY8", "B000FA57UI", "B00005N5RM", "B00005JOWW", "B000FAOC2W", "155890848X", "B000FOQ1KY", "B003EYVXSW", "B005CFBZVG", "B001DJLD1W", "B00699G622", "B004SEUIWY", "B00005A8XX", "B009XTF8KQ", "B001JFZ1UE", "B008VNIB6I", "B00006IUFV", "B00005K3NZ", "B000WC38EQ", "B0021L8UXA", "B000MV8AC2", "B001AGNMFI"], "bought_together": ["0783232039", "B0000AOX08"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001B1UO6W", "B00DTPRZ10", "0783232039", "B00DTPRZ24"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 85122}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.67, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

{"description": "There's a pretty good gimmick with these DVD extras aimed squarely at the pre-teen/early teen audience that ate up this film.

Decipher the clues and unlock the next set of extras: a nice bit on real treasure hunters, an awful piece on the Knights Templar, and one gem for kids: \"Riley Poole's Decode this!\" Actor Justin Bartha reprises his role (Nic Cage's techno-sidekick) and lectures a bit on the cooler side of language history and code-breaking with a few simple interactive games. If you get through it all, you unlock a hidden feature, a trivia track. Thankfully, those who do not want to go on the treasure hunt can access these features by reading the printed insert.

{"description": "Despite super effects, a huge budget, and the cinematic pedigree of alien-happy Steven Spielberg, this take on H.G. Wells's novel is basically a horror film packaged as a sci-fi thrill ride. Instead of a mad slasher, however, Spielberg (along with writers Josh Friedman & David Koepp) utilizes aliens hell-bent on quickly destroying humanity, and the terrifying results that prey upon adult fears, especially in the post-9/11 world. The realistic results could be a new genre, the grim popcorn thriller; often you feel like you're watching Schindler's List more than Spielberg's other thrill-machine movies (Jaws,Jurassic Park). The film centers on Ray Ferrier, a divorced father (Tom Cruise, oh so comfortable) who witnesses one giant craft destroy his New Jersey town and soon is on the road with his teen son (Justin Chatwin) and preteen daughter (Dakota Fanning) in tow, trying to keep ahead of the invasion. The film is, of course, impeccably designed and produced by Spielberg's usual crew of A-class talent. The aliens are genuinely scary, even when the film--like the novel--spends a good chunk of time in a basement. Readers of the book (or viewers of the deft 1953 adaptation) will note the variation of whom and how the aliens come to Earth, which poses some logistical problems. The film opens and closes with narration from the novel read by Morgan Freeman, but Spielberg could have adapted Orson Welles's words from the famous Halloween Eve 1938 radio broadcast: \"We couldn't soap all your windows and steal all your garden gates by tomorrow night, so we did the best next thing: we annihilated the world.\"--Doug ThomasWar of the Worldsat Amazon.comThe SoundtrackThe War of the Worlds(1953)War of the Worlds - The Complete First Season(TV series)Classic Sci-Fi Movies and Their RemakesAliens Invade on DVDThe Prog-rock Opera (no kidding)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B00005JL78", "B001SGEUYW", "B00008G8M4", "B00005JL3T", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AEFXNLY", "B00005JMXX", "B001OQCV2E", "B000VECAD0", "B002O3Z510", "B0002V7OI8", "B000H30B2C", "B000EGDB10", "B00005JN2Z", "B005LAIIMG", "B005PTYP70", "B002O3Z50G", "B0002V7ON8", "B00005JN0T", "B00K2CHW48", "B002SJIO4A", "0783225547", "B008JFUO36", "B00005JKLZ", "B00AS1Q93S", "1936594056", "B004EPYZUS", "B001TUZG4K", "B00AEFXR1K", "B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFXYJA", "0767817478", "B0034G4ORC", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00070FX5U", "B0045HCJSA", "B00000G3PA", "B005LAIHPE", "B003Y5H5GK", "B00AEBBA72", "B00003CWU3", "B00I9TDMRM", "B001ECDVKE", "B00003CXXP", "B000V4UFZK", "B0010X73ZG", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00005JKFR", "B000XT1P4S", "B003HKN52U", "B0009PW4D2", "B000HRMAPE", "B004EPYZPS", "B0018QPPXW", "B0002WZTOI", "B00AEBB9LO", "B004LWZW4M", "B003ABZHAO", "B003YJFALS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B000OT6V64", "B004P7CN7W", "B000CCBC9O", "B00000ILDD", "0767803434", "B001L57ZYM", "B000065V3G", "B007STBUHI", "B002ZG980U", "B008JFUQZ2", "B00005B6JZ", "B0006GANOQ", "B000F1IQN2", "1494343576", "B001GCUO02", "B00004Y87O", "0783226810", "B004EPYZSK", "B000P0J0BU", "B005LAIHXQ", "B001680M26", "B000EQHXN2", "B0045HCJFS", "B00004BZIY", "B00008G8M5", "B00003CXQA", "B008JFUS0U", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00EIN6KJ0", "B0000DZ6N3", "B000MV8A9A", "B00005JKYX", "B0000YEEGM", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B0013FCWUW", "B002ZG9864", "B00003CWTI", "B008MIMWQW", "B00IKM5OCO"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBB8VK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B004LWZW4M", "B00005JL78", "B004EPYZSK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18739}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JNTI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51upxzPRnXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "War of the Worlds"}

{"description": "Movies don't come any bigger than Peter Jackson'sKing Kong, a three-hour remake of the 1933 classic that marries breathtaking visual prowess with a surprising emotional depth. Expanding on the original story of the blonde beauty and the beast who falls for her, Jackson creates a movie spectacle that matches hisLord of the Ringsfilms and even at times evokes their fantasy world while celebrating the glory of '30s Hollywood. Naomi Watts stars as Ann Darrow, a vaudeville actress down on her luck in Depression-era New York until manic filmmaker Carl Denham (a game but miscast Jack Black) entices her with a lead role. Dazzled by the genius of screenwriter Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody), Ann boards the tramp steamer S.S.Venture, which she--and most of the wary crew--believes is headed for Singapore. Denham, however, is in search of the mythic Skull Island, hoping to capture its wonders on film and make a fortune. What he didn't count on were some scary natives who find that the comely Darrow looks like prime sacrifice material for a mysterious giant creature....There's no point in rehashing the entire plot, as every movie aficionado is more than familiar with the trajectory ofKing Kong; the challenge facing Jackson, his screenwriters, and the phenomenal visual-effects team was to breathe new life into an old, familiar story. To that degree, they achieve what could be best called a qualified success. Though they've assembled a crackerjack supporting cast, including Thomas Kretschmann as theVenture's hard-bitten captain and young Jamie Bell as a plucky crewman, the first third of the movie is rather labored, with too much minute detail given over to sumptuous re-creations of '30s New York and the unexciting initial leg of theVenture's sea voyage. However, once the film finds its way to Skull Island (which bears more than a passing resemblance toLOTR's Mordor),Kongturns into a dazzling movie triumph, by turns terrifying and awe-inspiring. The choreography and execution of the action set pieces--including one involving Kong and a trio of Tyrannosaurus Rexes, as well as another that could be charitably described as a bug-phobic's nightmare--is nothing short of landmark filmmaking, and a certain Mr. Spielberg should watch his back, asKongtrumps most anything that has come before it.Despite the visual challenges ofKing Kong, the movie's most difficult hurdle is the budding romance between Ann and her simian soulmate. Happily, this is where Jackson unqualifiedly triumphs, as this unorthodox love story is tenderly and humorously drawn, by turns sympathetic and wondrous. Watts, whose accessibility balances out her almost otherworldly loveliness, works wonders with mere glances, and Andy Serkis, who digitally embodies Kong here much as he did Gollum in theLOTRfilms, breathes vibrant life into the giant star of the film without ever overplaying any emotions. The final, tragic act of the film, set mostly atop the Empire State Building, is whereKongearns its place in movie history as a work that celebrates both the technical and emotional heights that film can reach.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"bought_together": ["B000EHQTZO", "B00AEFYEU8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EHQTZO", "B00AEFYEU8", "B0087ZG7HK", "0767817478"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 32487}, "categories": [["Movies & TV"]], "price": 8.94, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JO20", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513Y54TGdwL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "King Kong (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Country boy Larry Wilcox got first billing, but Erik Estrada was the breakaway star ofCHiPs, the popular late 1970s show about California highway patrolmen. With his blindingly white teeth, tight shirts, tighter pants, and exquisite '70s hair (which always emerged from under his helmet perfectly coifed), Estrada transformed his struggling career of playing hoodlums into becoming one of television's first Latino heroes--Frank \"Ponch\" Poncharello--and a skyrocketing sex symbol as well.CHiPsis basicallyAdam-12on motorcycles.

Every episode has at least one high-speed chase and just about every episode features Ponch hitting on a woman with gloriously feathered hair; watching episode after episode may feel a bit repetitive, but there's no denying that the stories are efficiently laid out and crisply executed. Foiling crime and rescuing lost dogs was the show's meat and potatoes, but the dessert was preposterousness like Ponch competing with a squad of middle-aged housewives on a game show or chasing after spilled chickens.

{"description": "Before the extended families that came to dominate prime time, fromFull HousetoParenthood, ABC launchedEight Is Enough, an adaptation ofCrossfirehost Thomas W. Braden's memoir. The pilot sets the tone: parenting is serious stuff, but a little humor never hurts (consequently, a redundant laugh track occasionally comes into play). Tom Bradford (Dick Van Patten, who sports TV's cutest comb-over), a Sacramento columnist, and his wife, Joan (Diana Hyland), are imperfect, but involved parents. As the series begins, oldest son David (Mark Hamill,Star Wars), a construction worker, leaves the nest, but there would be a few cast changes by the second episode. Notably, Grant Goodeve would replace Hamill, while Willie Aames took over as Tommy. With women's lib in full effect, the Bradford women spend much of these nine episodes trying to find their way in a changing world: Joan takes up photography, Susan (Susan Richardson) goes on a ski trip with a male coed, and Mary (Lani O'Grady) opposes her father during a newspaper strike. Other episodes revolve around Tommy's crush on an indecisive classmate (Charlene Tilton) and David's affair with an older woman (Adrienne Barbeau). That leaves Joanie (Laurie Walters), the drama student, Nancy (Dianne Kay), the cheerleader, Elizabeth (Connie Newton), the typical teenager, and Nicholas (Adam Rich), the elfin pipsqueak. Once you get past the flared jeans and wide lapels,Eight Is Enoughholds up surprisingly well, since the primary concerns are timeless. If the acting can be uneven, the chemistry between cast members papers over the cracks. Sadly, Hyland only filmed four episodes due to illness (she passed away in 1977). In the second season, Betty Buckley stepped in as the newest member of the Bradford clan.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's Endis a rollicking voyage in the same spirit of the two earlierPiratesfilms, yet far darker in spots (and nearly three hours to boot). The action, largely revolving around a pirate alliance against the ruthless East India Trading Company, doesn't disappoint, though the violence is probably too harsh for young children. Through it all, the plucky cast (Keira Knightley, Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush) are buffeted by battle, maelstroms, betrayal, treachery, a ferocious Caribbean weather goddess, and that gnarly voyage back from the world's end--but with their wit intact. As always, Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow tosses off great lines ; he chastises \"a woman scorned, like which hell hath no fury than!\" He insults an opponent with a string of epithets, ending in \"yeasty codpiece.\"!In the previousThe Curse of the Black Pearl, Sparrow was killed--sent to Davy Jones' Locker. In the opening scenes, the viewer sees that death has  not been kind to Sparrow--but that's not to say he hasn't found endless ways to amuse himself, cavorting with dozens of hallucinated versions of himself on the deck of the Black Pearl. But Sparrow is needed in this world, so a daring rescue brings him back. Keith Richards' much ballyhooed appearance as Jack's dad is little more than a cameo, though he does play a wistful guitar. But the action, as always, is more than satisfying, held together by Depp, who, outsmarting the far-better-armed British yet again, causes a bewigged commander to muse: \"Do you think he plans it all out, or just makes it up as he goes along?\" As far as fans are concerned, it matters not.--A.T. HurleyOn the DVDHere's something you can't say about just any DVD extras: There appears to bemoreof Keith Richards in the outtakes, interviews, and other special features on theAt World's Enddisc than in the actual film. For those scenes alone, this special edition is well worth the price. Richards looks as woozy and gamey as all the rumors suggested, and answers questions he's not asked, with Johnny Depp sitting next to him, almost acting as a translator. Richards offers pithy comments like, \"Everything I do is original, you better believe,\" and smiles when other cast members call him \"Two-Take Richards\" for supposedly nailing his scenes.The packed second disc also includes a terrific mini-doc on how the filmmakers created the famous maelstrom, in an enormous hanger in Palmdale, California, with the ships floating 30 feet off the ground. \"Just moving theBlack Pearlwas an enormous undertaking,\" says producer Jerry Bruckheimer with serious understatement. Other cool extras include \"Tale of the Many Jacks,\" deleted scenes with great commentary, \"The World of Chow Yun-Fat,\" a bio of composer Hans Zimmer, features on the set designers, a look at the impressive Brethren Court, and some hilarious bloopers. \"You can't curse in a Disney film,\" deadpans Depp when a costar blurts out something blue. \"See? I told him.\" The extras are truly as much of a rollicking adventure as the film.--A.T.

{"description": "Edith Piaf is the subject ofLa Vie en Rose, director Olivier Dahan's powerful if emotionally redundant biographical film about the iconic French superstar whose life, as depicted here, seems to have been a numbing succession of tragedies interrupted on occasion by artistic triumph. Dahan's portrait begins with Piaf's stay in a brothel as a young girl. Left to the care of her grandmother (who runs the place) after her father pulls her away from a narcissistic mother, Piaf undergoes significant health problems and grows up to sing on the street in lieu of outright prostitution. The film pulses along with the usual biopic rhythms, with pivotal moments in the life of Piaf (played as an adult by Marion Cotillard) turning up regularly only to be smacked aside by the unseen hand of perpetual misfortune. There's the impresario (Gerard Depardieu) who recognizes Piaf's great but raw talent only to have a run-in with the criminal element around her. There's the heavyweight fighter (Marcel Cerdan) who becomes the love of Piaf's life but can't be with her. Drug addiction, random car accidents, tax problems, you name it, it's all here, topped by an unnerving revelation that pops up inLa Vie en Rose's final moments. After awhile, with such a concentration of bad news squeezed into 140 minutes, one begins to wish Dahan had taken a more expansive approach to Piaf's life and times. But the film is never less than interesting, and the lead performance by Cotillard is often astonishing.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002LE8MGW", "B004SEUIXS", "B000UVV26A", "B001CIOCLC", "B000002UYD", "B002VKB0M4", "B000YPUFBA", "B002AG2NTI", "B0007Z0NYQ", "B0087IT8FK", "B000MEYIBG", "B0009P7EI2", "B004WDZR0O", "B00279MJHE", "0307268012", "B0069UV0AY", "B001THZAAI", "B005MYEQ4U", "B000002TMF", "B000LXH10I", "B00421IR5I", "B0000C9JFO", "B007I1Q59E", "B00AZNEVNE", "B000I6BJ56", "B000811672", "B00007J5VT", "B008H1Q3QY", "B0002S64SM", "B003L20III", "B00782O7IY", "1613743920", "B005V4X8PO", "B0007A61K6", "B0030MD5TS", "B0019UGYAU", "B0000YEENU", "B0084O26SI", "B004B3254Q", "B0001Y4JO8", "B004ZBFRRG", "B006KDHJMS", "B00A92MEJY", "B000UAE7MM", "B009CSVQ8Q", "B000SAAT76", "B00008979K", "B000CSUNRU", "B000YAA68W", "B004SIP6BI", "B0041KKYF6", "B002QQ8HAG", "B00005JM48", "B00007L4I6", "B000934FC2", "B005CKW8BM", "B004YCKKIM", "B002ONC9NC", "B001AZJKKK", "B0012EI8ES", "B009B8YMB0", "B000053VBN", "B0002V7TI8", "B004UXUUDA", "B008CJ0JS4", "B001DZA3W6", "B0031REQKE", "B000LXHK2C", "B005HISOJ4", "B000B58DHQ", "B000296E7W", "0792833279", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B005CU5OF4", "B0000A1HQP", "B00ENMZK1A", "B00166UFTS", "B000053VBP", "B00CDV4PPK", "B00005AUK9", "B004XVMCMG", "B00005NC66", "B00008G7UF", "B0031SU2Y2", "B00000AVEO", "B000M06KJ8", "B00ANQHR7U", "B004NWPY3E", "B001C71IEM", "B006OB3JVQ", "B00G15MDI0", "B001KVZ6AM", "B0036TGSJE", "B001O549EI", "B0045NXMJE", "B000SSQ7JC", "B004ZG5EYC", "B00000K3TS"], "bought_together": ["B002LE8MGW", "B001CIOCLC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005MYEQ4U", "B002LE8MGW", "B004SEUIXS", "B000UVV26A"]}, "price": 11.14, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9014}, "asin": "B00005JPX8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ylggkac7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "La Vie en Rose (Extended Version)"}
{"description": "Nearly 20 years after riding his last Crusade, Harrison Ford makes a welcome return as archaeologist/relic hunter Indiana Jones inIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, an action-packed fourth installment that's, in a nutshell, less memorable than the first three but great nostalgia for fans of the series. Producer George Lucas and screenwriter David Koepp (War of the Worlds) set the film during the cold war, as the Soviets--replacing Nazis as Indy's villains of choice and led by a sword-wielding Cate Blanchett with black bob and sunglasses--are in pursuit of a crystal skull, which has mystical powers related to a city of gold. After escaping from them in a spectacular opening action sequence, Indy is coerced to head to Peru at the behest of a young greaser (Shia LaBeouf) whose friend--and Indy's colleague--Professor Oxley (John Hurt) has been captured for his knowledge of the skull's whereabouts. Whatever secrets the skull holds are tertiary; its reveal is the weakest part of the movie, as the CGI effects that inevitably accompany it feel jarring next to the boulder-rolling world of Indy audiences knew and loved. There's plenty of comedy, delightful stunts--ants play a deadly role here--and the return ofRaiderslove interest Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood, once shrill but now softened, giving her ex-love bemused glances and eye-rolls as he huffs his way to save the day. Which brings us to Ford: bullwhip still in hand, he's a little creakier, a lot grayer, but still twice the action hero of anyone in film today. With all the anticipation and hype leading up to the film's release, perhaps no reunion is sweeter than that of Ford with the role that fits him as snugly as that fedora hat.--Ellen A.

{"description": "Alas! The fifthHarry Potterfilm has arrived. The time is long past that this can be considered a simple \"children's\" series--though children and adults alike will enjoy it immensely. Starting off from the dark and tragic ending of the fourth film,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenixbegins in a somber and angst-filled tone that carries through the entire 138 minutes (the shortest of anyHPmovie despite being adapted from the longest book). Hopes of winning the Quidditch Cup have been replaced by woes like government corruption, distorted media spin, and the casualties of war. As the themes have matured, so have the primary characters' acting abilities. Ron (Rupert Grint), Hermione (Emma Watson), and especially Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) are more convincing than ever--in roles that are more demanding.Harry is deeply traumatized from having witnessed Cedric Diggory's murder, but he will soon find that this was just another chapter in the continuing loss he will endure. Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) has returned and, in an attempt to conceal this catastrophe from the wizarding public, the Ministry of Magic has teamed up with the wizard newspaperThe Daily Prophetto smear young Potter and wise Dumbledore (Michael Gambon)--seemingly the only two people in the public eye who believe the Dark Lord has returned. With no one else to stand against the wicked Death Eaters, the Hogwarts headmaster is forced to revive his secret anti-Voldemort society, the Order of the Phoenix. This welcomes back characters like Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson), kind Remus Lupin (David Thewlis), fatherly Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), and insidious Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), and introduces a short list of intriguing new faces. In the meantime, a semi-psychotic bureaucrat from the Ministry (brilliantly portrayed by Imelda Staunton) has seized power at Hogwarts, and Harry is forced to form a secret society of his own--lest the other young wizards at his school be left ill-equipped to defend themselves in the looming war between good and evil. In addition, Harry is filled with an inexplicable rage that only his Godfather Sirius seems to be able to understand.This film, though not as frightening as its predecessor, earns its PG-13 rating mostly because of the ever-darkening tone.  As always, the loyal fans of J.K. Rowling's books will suffer huge cuts from the original plot and character developments, but make no mistake: this is agoodmovie.--Jordan ThompsonOn the DVDThe second disc ofThe Order of the Phoenixfeatures \"The Hidden Secrets of Harry Potter,\" a retrospective on the series so far, with \"Potter experts\" (i.e., people who run fan sites) weighing in on what's to come. This must have been filmed during production, because all their speculation about the conclusion of the saga is clearly dated and therefore superfluous (sinceOrderreleased theatrically at the same time as the seventh book, one would've expected a more current analysis). Many of the deleted scenes are mostly extensions, with the exception of one hilarious take of Professor Trelawney (Emma Thompson) trying--unsuccessfully--to eat gracefully during Dolores Umbridge's introduction at Hogwarts. The chatty actress Natalia Tena, who plays Tonks, gives a tour of the set in \"Trailing Tonks,\" even playing a Christmas song she wrote on her guitar, and director David Yates and editor Mark Day demonstrate editing 101 with a feature that lets you edit your own scene from the movie. Watch the feature but skip the self-editing part; the controls are too complicated to navigate and too frustrating to work properly (plus, hit the wrong button and you've gone all the way back to the beginning). A digital copy of the movie is also included on the bonus disc.--Ellen A.

{"description": "The Dark Knightarrives with tremendous hype (best superhero movie ever? posthumous Oscar for Heath Ledger?), and incredibly, it lives up to all of it.  But calling it the best superhero movie ever seems like faint praise, since part of what makes the movie great--in addition to pitch-perfect casting, outstanding writing, and a compelling vision--is that it bypasses the normal fantasy element of the superhero genre and makes it all terrifyingly real.  Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is Gotham City's new district attorney, charged with cleaning up the crime rings that have paralyzed the city. He enters an uneasy alliance with the young police lieutenant, Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), and Batman (Christian Bale), the caped vigilante who seems to trust only Gordon--and whom only Gordon seems to trust. They make progress until a psychotic and deadly new player enters the game: the Joker (Heath Ledger), who offers the crime bosses a solution--kill the Batman. Further complicating matters is that Dent is now dating Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, after Katie Holmes turned down the chance to reprise her role), the longtime love of Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne.In his last completed role before his tragic death, Ledger is fantastic as the Joker, a volcanic, truly frightening force of evil. And he sets the tone of the movie: the world is a dark, dangerous place where there are no easy choices.  Eckhart and Oldman also shine, but as good as Bale is, his character turns out rather bland in comparison (not uncommon for heroes facing more colorful villains). Director-cowriter Christopher Nolan (Memento) follows his critically acclaimedBatman Beginswith an even better sequel that sets itself apart from notable superhero movies likeSpider-Man 2andIron Manbecause of its sheer emotional impact and striking sense of realism--there are no suspension-of-disbelief superpowers here. At 152 minutes, it's a shade too long, and it's much too intense for kids. But for most movie fans--and not just superhero fans--The Dark Knightis a film for the ages.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B000PC6A3E", "B002ZG981E", "B00G4RD4PQ", "B0039208QM", "B001GMALGY", "B00E2Y0YBK", "B00C2IGQBA", "B0039208JE", "B00H14WTLQ", "B0039208CG", "B0085D3I3K", "B0039208C6", "B000M5AJQI", "B00319ECGK", "B001FB55H6", "B00EIG5M5A", "7020070078", "B00E2Y6AUY", "B00D5FMGGS", "B001OQCV6K", "B0013FBS20", "B000Q6GX5Y", "B001GKJ2FC", "B00FPS79F6", "B001992NUQ", "B004JMSIRC", "B001RIY4WE", "B00DYEN6XC", "B008QZ5PY2", "B001F7MSG6", "B00FAHYNWE", "B00J7PRJXU", "B001AQT0Z4", "B001UV4XEW", "B0083SBJXS", "B00AEFY552", "B00C8RD79O", "B007KAJG3K", "B007L4HET8", "B004EPZ07U", "B007L4HFDI", "B00AEFXKOO", "B000PC0U1W", "B00C6B8TB8", "B00HINFI4K", "B003TT2X6I", "B001KZIRM2", "B002ZG99NG", "B00EZ4M68G", "B004SIP90G", "B003ZHR6RK", "B001GCUO16", "B003TT2X6S", "B00JNEWSLS", "B001F3FUK6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B002ZG981E", "B000PC6A3E"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPY0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pGxSkkz4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Dark Knight [Theatrical Release]"}

Tom Selleck has a lean, weathered face that sits nicely atop a horse and beneath a broad-brimmed hat; he plays a canny cowboy who's come to make good on a promise to a dying man and ends up caught between a beautiful woman (Virginia Madsen) and a wicked man in black--a couple of them, actually.Crossfire Trailhas just about every element you could ask for (a Sioux war party, a cruel hired gun, a shootout in the street, even a cattle stampede), but it spins them out with such clean efficiency that you can't help but enjoy it.

{"description": "Another of those cut-and-paste comedies from Adam Sandler's production company starring one of Sandler's erstwhileSaturday Night Livecolleagues,The Adventures of Joe Dirtfinds the magnificently caustic David Spade emasculated by a sentimental script and shapeless, haphazard cutting. Spade plays the title character, a white-trash orphan in search of the parents who abandoned him at the Grand Canyon. The humor is supposed to come from Joe's misadventures, his redneck gullibility, and his encounters with such figures as a serial killer, a wacked-out janitor (Christopher Walken), and a lovable gal (Jamie Pressly) who may, unfortunately, turn out to be his sister. But the squishier requirements of the story, requiring the audience to feel deeply for the pain of Spade's caricature, are an irritant and force Spade to veer from the nastier stuff he does so well.

{"description": "Deservedly hailed as one of the best films of 2001,Witmakes it clear why top-ranking talents seek refuge in the quality programming of HBO. Unhindered by box-office pressures, director Mike Nichols and Emma Thompson turn the most unglamorous topic--the physical and psychological ravages of cancer--into an exquisite contemplation of life, learning, and tenacious, richly expressed humanity. In adapting Margaret Edson's compassionate, Pulitzer Prize-winning play, Nichols and Thompson open up the one-room setting with a superb supporting cast. But their focus remains on the hospital experience of Vivian (Thompson), a fiercely demanding professor of English literature whose academic specialty--the metaphysical poetry of John Donne--is the armor she wears against the cruel indignities of her cancer treatment. While losing all that she held dear, she reassesses her life as an aloof intellectual, andWitilluminates her bracingly eloquent and deeply moving struggle for dignity, meaning, and peace at life's ultimate crossroads.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0571198775", "B00008L3U4", "B00664AM02", "B00067BCBI", "B00000F5MN", "B00BTYJYP8", "0061137596", "B000068MBW", "B00005RDAN", "082633038X", "B005TZFZBU", "B0001CNRAM", "0061230979", "B0007WFUGK", "1573226572", "B00005AQMJ", "B00003CXC9", "0826330371", "B0007LFPJ8", "082221704X", "032308334X", "B00000IQV7", "B00B8X4WBG", "B004YCKKIM", "0553210351", "0971907498", "B00AEBB9FA", "B000TV1ST2", "B00KMULA9I", "1468014315", "B004QL7KKC", "B0001I2BUI", "B004AE3QYE", "B0043X1FL8", "0965464911", "B004OE9P2C", "B001OQCV1K", "0679742441", "B002D755AI", "0345425979", "B00008L3SE", "B00J5LXQKQ", "B000R7HY00", "B00BTYHBX0", "B0073U2EWM", "1451624123", "B0063HO5C8", "0803617844", "B005DXCOY4", "B00K6D1SAC", "B0007QJ1W0", "B000063ING", "B0002J4X20", "B00AEBB8YM", "1605477303", "0135080908", "1451667256", "0767821432", "0763765422", "1449649009", "B001TKNWUU", "B001GF8WPI", "0132706687", "B00GPWEPZ8", "B00006L92W", "B007CK3NYG", "B0006IIPM6", "B00005JKWX", "0375757759", "B0015OKWKI", "B0000714BZ", "B000K7VHQE", "0787976385", "B0011V7PSC", "0763773840", "B00004TJKK", "B0015OKWKS", "B000F1IQNM", "B0013K2ZGI", "0095234772", "B0007P0YKY", "B0000CE684", "0470959584", "B00005YUO1", "0140422099", "B00GUO2SKA", "0801478731", "0767805712", "B000H0MKOC", "B0018YCF50", "0783227906", "0826157912", "0064430189", "B00AEFYSWM", "1594733120", "B00000JMOF", "0060775823", "1558101764", "B00003CX8U", "B00005BCK9"], "bought_together": ["0571198775"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BTYJYP8", "0571198775", "B00008L3U4", "0826330371"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12441}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005MKKV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41MQWHl-FRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wit"}
{"description": "The Dish, a good-natured and effortlessly funny Australian drama-comedy directed by Rob Sitch (The Castle), is filled with warm-hearted characters and has a factual hook that's irresistibly inspiring. This cumulative goodwill springs forth from the rural town of Parkes in New South Wales, where a 1,000-ton radio observatory dish is recruited to relay telemetry, voice, and television signals from the historicApollo 11moon landing in July 1969. To make sure the dish delivers Neil Armstrong's \"giant leap for mankind\" to 600 million eager viewers, site director Cliff Buxton (Sam Neill, at his gentle best) relies on a three-man crew consisting of an American NASA watchdog (Patrick Warburton, resembling a bearish Clark Kent), a sarcastic engineer (Kevin Harrington), and a lovestruck math whiz (Tom Long) who's pining for the sister of the dish's rather dimly overzealous security guard (Taylor Kane).Numerous other supporting characters add color to the proceedings, and crises arise (albeit briefly) when power outage, signal loss, and windstorms threaten to spoil Parkes's proudest hour. It all rates a bit high on the cuteness meter, butThe Dishis so smoothly amusing that you won't object to its eagerness to please. By focusing on the Aussie locals, the film reminds us that the moon landing was an occasion of global unity, and pride in all humanity is reflected in the wondrous smiles of Cliff, his crew, and the citizens of Parkes. That they played such a small but pivotal role in this historical milestone is just one of many joys to be discovered in this delightful little movie.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00001U0DW", "B00005JLD4", "B0006FYOTC", "B000NJL4QC", "0783225733", "B004SIPAJG", "B0007ZEOPK", "B00000K3CS", "B00049QJ9I", "B001CDR1F6", "B00JAQJMJ0", "0767812166", "B004SIP8WU", "B002EAYDUC", "B000294TC4", "B0001DCYUU", "B00005JMYC", "B00BTYJYR6", "B005A1GRSI", "B000MX7V3Y", "B0002V7S34", "B00B4804LM", "B008LFYZAM", "B00H83EUQW", "B0045HCJKS"], "bought_together": ["B00001U0DW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00A33J8YS", "B00001U0DW", "B00BTYJYR6", "B000XJ5TPE"]}, "price": 41.25, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 41306}, "asin": "B00005MKKS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PEGZKY64L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Dish"}

{"description": "After Germany invades Poland in 1939, the Nazis decree that 350,000 Warsaw Jews be forcibly moved into a cordoned area known as the Warsaw Ghetto. Idealistic teacher Mordechai Anielewicz (Hank Azaria) decides the Jews must rise up against the Nazis and creates the Jewish Fighting Organization (JFO).  He tries to secure the support of Adam Czerniakow (Donald Sutherland), the morally conflicted head of the Warsaw Ghetto's Jewish Council, but Adam declines because he knows that any act of resistance will provoke the Germans to retaliate by killing innocent Jews.  Determined to mobilize a resistance alone if he has to, Mordechai recruits his friends and covert couriers whose ability to pass as Aryan helps them smuggle in arms and explosives from the Aryan side of the city, building up an arsenal to fight the Nazis.When the Germans begin deporting 300,000 Jews to the Treblinka death camp, the JFO begins acts of resistance that culminate with ghetto fighters firing their first gunshots against the Nazis.  When it becomes clear that the JFO is a force to be reckoned with, the German High Command sends in General Stroop (Jon Voight), who is determined to end the uprising in two or three days.Capturing the horror that unfolds is Fritz Hippler (Cary Elwes), a filmmaker assigned by Hitler's chief propagandist to promote anti-Semitism with a film about Jewish life in the ghetto.When the Nazis continue to suffer more casualties in their battle with the ghetto fighters, General Stroop decides to raze the ghetto.  But even that can't stop the JFO.  Forced to go underground into bunkers but energized by their success, the resisters fight on, ultimately holding off the Nazi army longer than the entire country of Poland.  They're determined to live with honor--and if need be, die with honor--while lighting the torch for resistance in the occupied territories.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000087EYX", "B00005BJWC", "B000FDFSYA", "B000HC2PLS", "B003JLL2RW", "B004KL0OVU", "B003K1H14E", "B000KB48NE", "B00018D4PO", "B0000DZTIS", "B001UFE8PM", "B0001DMW9S", "B0002CX1NY", "B0047UJBJA", "B000YKT4BW", "B003YKYX7Y", "B00005JMLR", "B00AEFXRRO", "B003S5TOZG", "B002WBYDR6", "B00005YUO1", "B000EQ5Q2W", "B000TXNDT8", "B001KZOUU0", "B000TGCR38", "B000TLTCPO", "B0006Z2NZ4", "B005DKS1TE", "B007UI0CIA", "B004EI2NWM", "B000H5V8H2", "B00ERH134Y", "B000ADWCV2", "B004VWKD4Q", "B0012QE4PI", "B00B0U2SFE", "B00C2535TE", "B00BC1UPRO", "B004UXUUDA", "B00007KQ9X", "B0030ZIZTK", "B000FVQLRA", "B000WPJSYM", "B002KECJZ8", "0306805332", "B001NRY6NG", "B00007ELEV", "B00D3XMA9A", "B002ID09BM", "B005HQBO9I", "B0013D8L8G", "B001F0TM2Q", "B002U1LGSW", "B000HEWGVU", "B004SEUJ82", "B00003CWS3", "B002TQKL66", "B00JEEZTF4", "B0028YW3CE", "B00BWH6DK6", "B000KJTG0G", "B003XMKU4I", "B00IVLR9JA", "B003M05KU0", "B0009RCPUC", "B0007SWPV2", "B0016LFG38", "B005OTGS4E", "B003PMWF62", "B00D3XM7H0", "B00ID8HATK", "B009XTF8NI", "B000NVT0RU", "B0000BWVCR", "B0049TC8CQ", "B004H9ZQ4K", "B000AQ69R2", "B004D45NYC", "B00G15MDI0", "B00CVB6UXW", "B00BX8PG4S", "B00ENMZK1A", "B0066E6RWE", "B000065B03", "B00097DY66", "B0095ZIHZ6", "B002QP145C", "B0009UZGLY", "B000S0KYTE", "B000NVIGLQ", "B007S0DCUU", "B00005NFZD", "B00ID8H8EW", "B001E1HCQO", "B00366E1AU", "B00005B6OY", "B004IFYMXO", "B0046YK4KW", "B000A6T1ZE", "0784011710"], "bought_together": ["B000087EYX", "B00005BJWC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005BJWC", "B003JLL2RW", "B000087EYX", "B0000DZTIS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 33637}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 8.27, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005QAQI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61GD3G0B8VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Uprising"}

He's hunted, interrogated, tortured, and finally drafted into a sadistic king's army of lost boys kidnapped from worlds all over the galaxy.

{"description": "Taking a cue from the caped crusader's comic book rebirth in Frank Miller'sThe Dark Knight ReturnsandBatman: Year One, this 1992 animated series saved the TV Batman from a fate worse than camp and drew an unexpected audience for an afternoon cartoon: adults.

Star Katsu and director Kazuo Mori flesh out the enigmatic Ichi in this outing, creating a more haunted and less conniving character who prefers to keep his identity shrouded and his sword sheathed. Nonetheless the peace-loving swordsman is reluctantly and repeatedly forced to fight when he's attacked by a government goon squad, a gang of hoodlums, and an angry one-armed swordsman whose interest in Ichi is purely personal. This action-packed entry, which ultimately brings our hero back to the site of his previous film for the furious climax, practically revels in the concentrated bursts of Ichi's lightning attack.The newly restored DVD features a small stills gallery, a fold-out insert with an essay by Tatsu Aoki (a self described \"Ichi Freak\"), and four collector cards.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006IUI1", "B000063UQU", "B00006IUI2", "B0000A02TR", "B0000A02TS", "B000ASATM6", "B00008K76Q", "B00006IUI3", "B0000A02TT", "B00008K76P", "B00008K76R", "B0001OGURC", "B003JETUN2", "B0002DB554", "B0002DB54U", "B0017MO0U6", "B0001OGURM", "B0001UZRN4", "B0001Z9352", "B0001610RU", "B0001NBNH0", "B0001BFDI2", "B0000B1ODS", "B0001J0VYA", "B0001J0VYK", "B0002DB55O", "B006C1S1DY", "B0007989YS", "B000FKPE9W", "B0001610OS", "B00687XNNK", "B000C6NP7M", "B008L0YMSW", "B000JBXP4S", "B0001HAIP4", "B006H3KQSK", "B00065GX0K", "B004XQO8MS", "B000BB14I0", "B003BV8HXC", "B000BPK2HK", "B005LAIH2W", "B001DWNUEC", "1586558315", "B00073K7KI", "B000AQKUGI", "B000EWBNZK", "B000NDFHVQ", "B0006IINIC", "B0007IO6XW", "B0002CR08G", "B0009IW8BW", "B0006IINIW", "B000NA1W9K", "B001GR2ZA4"], "bought_together": ["B00006IUI1", "B00006IUI2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000ASATM6", "B0017MO0U6", "B000063UQU", "B0002DB54U"]}, "price": 34.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 257551}, "asin": "B000063UQV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51zWRRUrlrL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Zatoichi the Blind Swordsman, Vol. 2 - The Tale of Zatoichi Continues"}
{"description": "Retelling a story that has made it onto the silver screen more than most, this latest adaptation of The Count of Monte Cristo makes yet another swashbuckling attempt to win over a new generation of cinema goers. A dashing James Caviezel takes the role of the Count, who is driven by a desire for revenge after being betrayed by his best friend Fernand (played by a dishevelled Guy Pearce) and landed with 16 years of solitary confinement in Chateau D'If, a damp cavernous prison. Thus the scene is set for a good old-fashioned romp. The trouble with this \"re-imagining\" (to borrow a phrase from Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes) is that it's never quite sure whether to take itself seriously or not. Alexandre Dumas's original story is a traditionally melodramatic tale of deceit and double-crossing, with clear-cut bad guys and a moral lesson to be learned at the end. Here, director Kevin Reynolds appears unsure about whether to stick with tradition or bring the story up to date and turn it into a post-modern play on the old Victorian values and style. When the Count and his heavy-breathing loved one are reunited, their kiss is actually framed as a cameo. Both lead actors are also prone to heavy bouts of overacting, garnishing their performances with exaggerated baroque gestures. Clearly this is a film in which the actors could over-indulge themselves and (almost) get away with it, were it not for the fact that--bar Richard Harris as the \"Priest\"--none of them seem to have the faintest idea about how to conduct themselves in a period drama. This Count of Monte Cristo will leave the audience a little confused as to whether they should cry along with the story or laugh along with the actors. --Nikki Disney On the DVD: The Count of Monte Cristo on disc offers no escape from the dry drawl of director Kevin Reynolds, who features in almost every element of the extensive extras package.

{"description": "The consequences of time travel are the thematic framework for this  compilation of episodes from the revampedOuter Limitsanthology series,  produced for the Showtime network. The six stories compiled here are indicative  of the new version's competent but uneventful nature; scripting, performances,  and direction (all hampered by the program's low budget) rarely live up to the  plots' potential or the drama and suspense of the original series. Amanda  Plummer's Emmy-winning turn as a scientist who travels 50 years into the past to  commit a murder in the Season Two episode \"A Stitch in Time\" is the highlight of  the disc; the rest (culled from the series' seven-season run) offer well-worn  variations on time travel themes.

Scott uses cool spy equipment to encourage the egotistical Robinson to work with him.

{"description": "TheIdentityDVD features are not quite as enticing as they sound.  Of chief interest is the extended branched version of the film (available in widescreen only), but there's only one added scene (an interesting but not critical minute-long sequence that would have been the first conference-room scene), and the differences in the alternate ending are so subtle that you'll miss them if you literally blink a few times.  There's no question it could affect audience perception, but unlike most alternate endings, it doesn't affect the actual outcome.  (Seespoilerfor more information.)  The four deleted scenes (which don't include either of the above-mentioned additions) aren't that exciting, and the optional director commentary notes that these deletions generally served to cut moments of character and comic relief in favor of moving the story along, which is one reason the film runs a brisk 90 minutes. James Mangold's director commentary on the feature is good, though, as he discusses such matters as the logistics of the perpetual downpour and a crucial bit of dialogue removed from the film's climax.  Considering that downpour and the contrasting darks and lights of the film, picture quality is good, and the thunder claps sound great in 5.1 sound so there are no complaints about the DVD's presentation of the film itself.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000TJ6PBK", "B00006AUJR", "B0009YA3OA", "B000DZ7YN8", "B00005JNY3", "B00AADAK5W", "1558908382", "B00008K77D", "B0002DB54A", "B000RGN2JI", "B00AEBB8NI", "B000P0I4O4", "B00003CXZ4", "B004ZNFTDQ", "B0015XHQVC", "B00026ZD04", "B00014NEZI", "B003LR5BD0", "B00092ZLSK", "B004SIP92O", "B00000JGHL", "B003VA3JUO", "B00BNH9NCU", "B00DZP1C2W", "B00I45844W", "B004YCKKFK", "B00011CZRE", "B0002234LS", "B001HVZOB6", "B005S9EJ8W", "B000A2UBN4", "B00HOGBXS6", "B000OYC7BW", "B0004Z31OS", "B00AEBB89W", "B00AEFXW8I", "B00009OWJY", "B002NZK5RI", "B00AEFXEGS", "B00007AJF8", "B003ASLJQ8", "B000R4SMCW", "B000069HZP", "B00003CXGA", "B00005V9HH", "B0001FR3IQ", "B00005JPT0", "B000SK5Z20", "B00008YJDK", "B0013D8LBS", "6305238065", "B0021L8UFI", "B004P7CN7W", "078322799X", "B001OQCV2E", "B0002WT4OE", "B00B6OEB18", "B00003CXKM", "B004SIP9RO", "B000RZIGUE", "B004B3PBFQ", "B004LWZW24", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00096S49Y", "B000LC55F2", "0783240295", "B00009L1TA", "B0034G4P30", "B002O3Z4WK", "B00005JLO8", "B001ILFUBE", "B00005JKIS", "B004SIP9MY", "6305718954", "B000ALM40I", "B0001Z52RU", "B0010X73ZG", "B000A5045Q", "B00005JMWP", "B00005JN2Z", "B000F5WR4W", "B0000648X0", "B0021L8UPS", "B00AEBBA2W", "6301971345", "B002UJIY7A", "B0006IIKQW", "B00B96TGQS", "B004BLJQOK", "B00AEFXKZ8", "6304806434", "B001NPD9LS", "B000U1ZV76", "B003L20IEW", "B00596WFE4", "B000GCFO0I", "B00005UQ9W", "B000053UIF", "B0000YTOL2"], "bought_together": ["B000TJ6PBK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000TJ6PBK", "B0012Q7M02", "B00006AUJR", "B00AEBBA2W"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30202}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.73, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00008EY9G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RKTbv5kkL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Identity"}

{"description": "Depending on how you liked this romantic comedy, you just might find more laughs in the delightful banter between the director and his two stars on the commentary track. Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant join writer-director Marc Lawrence for a lively 102 minutes of conversation. Not much movie magic is discussed, but the three talents will sacrifice all for a good joke. It's best to watch the commentary track with the \"Two Bleeps Notice\" viewing option: when a heart appears on-screen, you can immediately view outtakes from that stage of the film. The flubs, on-set antics, and jokes are all guaranteed to bring a laugh. Other extras include two additional scenes (the wedding finale was judicially cut) and a HBO puff-piece on the making of the film. Yet the disc is a must-have for any fan of Bullock or Grant because it offers a chance to listen in on them; they're just as charming off-screen as on.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002K0WBXW", "6304765266", "B000023VTP", "B00005JPE3", "B000YDBPAM", "B00AEBB8NS", "B000HEWEE4", "0783235380", "B00003CXSM", "B0009OL7Z4", "B0000897EG", "B00AEBB8YW", "B0007PLLBU", "B0021L8UZS", "B00006ZXSO", "B00AEFY99O", "B0000AOV4I", "B004SIP9RO", "B004SIP8JI", "B00007E2F5", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B00008G7UF", "B00006ZXSQ", "B0038N9X3Q", "B001ECDVK4", "B00006FMUW", "B00005JPSM", "B002NZK5V4", "B002ZG989G", "B000MQC9H4", "B00066FB2A", "B000CEV3M8", "B00000JGHN", "B00005JN3W", "B00005JG6N", "B00005JL7Q", "B002SYAGNC", "B00004UEDQ", "B000CCBCAS", "B00081U7HC", "B0015I2RT8", "B00068GTK6", "B000NA1WE0", "B0006GANOQ", "B002ZG988M", "B00006ZXSN", "B00AEBB9WI", "B005XB8SRS", "6305213283", "B0045HCJJ4", "B002ZG9968", "B00E8RKHWW", "B004SEUJK0", "B00006ZXSL", "B000A343RI", "B00AKGG6JS", "B0006A9FIM", "B00005O5CM", "B00AEFXWXI", "6305236569", "B00008G6E8", "B00AEFXYOA", "B004EPZ070", "B002VECM6S", "B002P413IC", "B00AEFYWQY", "B000QGDY0G", "B003B3V0N4", "B0013D8LHC", "0780625277", "B003Y5H574", "B0000VD02Y", "0767811100", "B00164X59M", "6305736685", "B001AKTZW8", "B001WAKOW6", "B00EP2SN58", "B00EIBO8T6", "B000XJD33O", "B000BNX3B4", "B00006ZXSK", "B004SIP8LG", "B00005JM55", "0767821769", "B004SIP9VA", "B00AEFYSEA", "B0009KA2OA", "B001C5LLQ4", "B00164KYV4", "B002NZK5R8", "B002NZK5VO", "B002NZK5RS", "B000683VI4", "0800141660", "B0002Y121K", "B0071HPOGK", "B00AEFXKUI", "B00006ZXSI", "B003Y5H524"], "bought_together": ["B002K0WBXW", "6304765266"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002K0WBXW", "B004SIP9RO", "6304765266", "B000023VTP"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18204}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.56, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00008NRI7", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VJyiu%2ByUL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Two Weeks Notice (Full-Screen Edition) (Snap Case)"}

{"description": "Jack Bauer is having another one of his \"very bad days\" in the second season of the groundbreaking real-time thriller24. Once again the hours are ticking by with more guaranteed cliffhangers than a convention of mountain climbers. Holed up in a Los Angeles condo and estranged from his daughter, Jack is no longer on the government payroll; unfortunately for him, this small fact doesn't seem to matter to President David Palmer and the NSA, who call him back in to the CTU and give him 24 hours to infiltrate a terrorist organization that is planning to detonate a dirty bomb in the city of angels. All Jack wants is to get his daughter out of the city, unfortunately Kim's new employer, the abusive father of the child she is nannying, has other ideas.Fans of theoriginalwon't be disappointed, as there are more than enough shock moments in the first few hours to hint at the climactic build-up to come, while newcomers can quickly get involved in the lives of Jack and his family. There are some new characters to bolster the veteran cast and, interestingly (although not surprisingly), Jack's character has taken an altogether darker, more psychopathic turn. The danger the characters find themselves in also has a much more global, not to mention topical, impetus, grounded as it is in the war against terrorism.  Although the territory is more familiar this time around, this second season is just as much a high-tension, taut, adrenalin-fuelled ride as the first, and one that will have you glued to your TV for the next 24 hours.--Kristen Bowditch", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002XVQSU", "B000NDEXK2", "B000B837XI", "B000ICLRKC", "B000NDEXKW", "B000MR8W92", "B001L5SRJE", "B002ZCY7SW", "B001DMVZOE", "B0015QWZ8S", "B002ZCY7TG", "0756632277", "B0001WHXM0", "B00G4RCXPI", "B00KPP6ZLS", "B0000DIJNU", "B000FIMG68", "B000AJJNFE", "B00005JNOG", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B001OQCVFG", "B002N5N5QQ", "B00HT850YW", "B003FSTN52", "B000Q6GUW0", "B0049P1VHS", "B00ECHBSP8", "B004UXVDJA", "B0058YPJ2W", "B00J5LXT44", "B0044E9JU0", "B001GCUER0", "B00IWTVDUW", "B002ZCY8CC", "B0058YPGSY", "B0019L21GA", "B003L77GK6", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00HEPE6MM", "B0024FAR5M", "B00KPP6R9S", "B00005JOC9", "B004EXWGHY", "B00AIBZMD6", "B009LDD1H6", "B000P6YNSE", "B000EWBNMI", "B00ITAQ2T6", "B001AI776G", "B0036EH3XE", "B0089AD8IO", "B000YABIQ6", "B00FGEO9NE", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B009LDCZ7I", "B00IKM5LXG", "B000HEVZ9E", "B003F3NDWG", "B00AB65RUG", "B00HF98SJY", "B000BF0C8E", "B000BGR1B4", "B00E8OMZGG", "B00JA3RVG4"], "bought_together": ["B000NDEXK2", "B0002XVQSU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000NDEXK2", "B000ICLRKC", "B0002XVQSU", "B000MR8W92"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 4639}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 39.69, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B00008YGRU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516918NBNNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "24: Season 2"}

{"description": "Yuri Otani, the 6th grade heroine of this 2001 OVA, is elected by her class  to be their \"alien fighter:\" With Kasumi and Kumi, she tracks down weird  beasties that appear at their elementary school. The girls, who look like bobblehead  dolls with no nose, wear a \"symbiotic alien borg\"--a sort of winged frog--on  their heads into battle. Yuri spends all four episodes of the series sniveling  about how scared she is, how she doesn't want to deal with aliens, etc.  Irritating as Yuri is, the viewer may pity her, because she's stuck in a story that  makes no sense whatsoever. Sometimes the girls destroy the aliens with  drill-like tentacles the borgs sprout; sometimes they keep them penned up at school.

{"description": "Irreversiblebegins with the closing credits running backwards before the film begins (or ends) with Marcus (Vincent Cassell) and Pierre (Albert Dupontel) being escorted out of a gay S&M; club by the cops, Marcus with his arm broken and Pierre in handcuffs. The \"story\" proceeds to unwind in a series of single-take scenes that unfoldMemento-style, with each scene giving more context to what we have seen previously.  Each scenario depicts actions, dialogue, incident, behavior, and circumstances that the lead characters might have wished didn't happen, ranging from extreme violence through awkward social situations to mild embarrassment. The central character (and possible dreamer of this whole what-if story) emerges as Alex (Monica Bellucci), who suffers the worst in a very hard-to-watch rape sequence in an underpass. Semi-improvised, the scenes all have attack and power as themes, with later/earlier conversational sequences that suggest life isn't all sexual assaults in the dark, showing equal cinematic imagination with the horrors. Arguably, this is not a film most would subject themselves to twice, but it is something that stays in the mind for days after viewing, sparking far more ideas and emotions than most wallow-in-nastiness pictures.--Kim Newman", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005K9O8", "B001MEJY8W", "B00GGY4R3K", "B0048LPRCS", "B001B187L6", "B00125WATQ", "B00003CXXY", "B000FWHW68", "B0048LPRD2", "B002EOVXBK", "B000GI3RHY", "B0014VPFVS", "B003KGBISE", "B003VL3UR0", "B000WMEE9E", "B000WC38EQ", "B000L6S92E", "B0006JMLVQ", "B0082A3HFK", "B005ER6STG", "B00003JRAV", "B00375LBKI", "B001AZKB8K", "B00699G622", "B0040QYRT0", "B00006FDBW", "B0000CABGW", "B00GRZPRB4", "B004BLTNM0", "B000UW8596", "B0009WFEDC", "B004C00EM8", "B0007TZHWA", "B000ARFPMQ", "B005SQRYB4", "B003B2UK1S", "B006UGWDXU", "B00DMUFXOS", "B00JVQ7QTM", "6305228876", "B003L20IEM", "B0032D5ESA", "B00BSU0FQA", "B002EOVXCY", "B001JV5BIA", "B0060AAMEI", "B0000AQS1H", "B002R3CQDC", "B005IGVTM4", "B004LXBKEC", "B003KGBISO", "B00005JMIJ", "B000IMVE32", "B008G1JIQC", "B00006LPER", "B00005U14H", "B00699G6AE", "B001C5LLVE", "B0041KKYCY", "B0043X1FEU", "B00EOBB7LC", "B009OCR2U6", "B000HXDWNM", "B0002DB52M", "B001VG2MAI", "B002C8YSCE", "B0000BWVCR", "B00HW3EJ6Y", "B00AYGVCCK", "B000I8OMEY", "B00023P4I8", "B0009S2T0M", "B003Y5H5G0", "B00LLAV26O", "B00GPPXNIK", "B000X1RYEQ", "B00000IC7G", "B004XZ99FK", "B006Z7Z3VS", "B001PYD0LQ", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B004P2VQZ2", "B001FOK70S", "B00DI67YCU", "B00K0MM4AM", "B0009VRHLK", "B00006FMCS", "B000BGH29K", "B003L20IEC", "B000AC7P5Q", "B0002KPHZG", "B001AIQ14A", "B00APUAKYG", "B00AY6PK5A", "B00284BNKC", "B006OB3K56"], "bought_together": ["B001MEJY8W", "B00GGY4R3K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001MEJY8W", "B00GGY4R3K", "B0048LPRCS", "B001B187L6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 33569}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.13, "brand": "LION&#39;S GATE ENTERTAINMENT", "asin": "B00009W0U4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41GBWP82KQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Irreversible"}

{"description": "The fifth season of Joss Whedon's hit series started out in excellent form as slayer extraordinaire Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) did battle with the most famous of vampires (that Dracula guy) and then went on to spar with another nemesis, little sister Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg). Wait--Buffy has a teenage sister? Where hasshebeen the past four years? And why is everyone acting like she's always been around? Turns out that young Dawn is actually \"The Key,\" a form of pure energy that, true to its name, helps open the gates between different dimensions. To protect said key from falling into the wrong hands, a group of monks gave it human form and sent it to the fiercely protective Buffy for safekeeping, creating new memories of Dawn for everyone as if she'd existed... well, always. Why all the super secrecy? There's this very, very,verybad girl named Glory (Clare Kramer) who wants the keyverybadly, and will do anything to get it. Oh, and by the way, Glory isn't just a run-of-the-mill demon... she'swayworse.Some fans will tell you thatBuffy\"jumped the shark\" with the introduction of Dawn, when in actuality this season was the pinnacle of the show's achievement, as there was superb comedy to be had (\"Buffy Vs. Dracula,\" the double-Xander episode \"The Replacement,\" the introduction of the \"Buffybot\" in \"Intervention\") as well as some of television's best drama. The Whedon-scripted and -directed \"The Body\" remains one ofBuffy's best episodes, when the young woman who faces down supernatural death on a daily basis finds herself powerless in the wake of her mother's sudden passing. The first third or so of the season was a bit choppy, but once the evil Glory came into her own,Buffywas a television force to be reckoned with. Kramer was the show's best villain (after the evil Angel, natch), and the supporting cast was never better. But as always, it was the superb Gellar who was the powerful center of the show, sparking opposite lovelorn vampire Spike (James Marsters) and wrestling with moral dilemmas rarely seen on television. With this season, Buffy Summers became, like Tony Soprano, one of television's true greats.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EHSVMS", "B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVN2", "B000EHSVLE", "B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVKK", "B000I0QLR8", "B000I0QLQY", "B000I0QLS2", "B000I0QLRS", "B000I0QLRI", "B007H9CNOI", "B000HD1482", "B003YF9Q08", "B0006IUE16", "B0009W5J4Q", "B000CCBCGM", "B000B5XOW0", "B000GG4Y6O", "B000ERVJM2", "B000JLTRIG", "B00344EAQO", "B00466H3CW", "1593078226", "B006LG74Q0", "B002JVWR4U", "B00001R3O1", "B000O77SN6", "B00006J3WH", "B0024FAR66", "B0000AQS0F", "B000X5SPBI", "B00AMDA2QC", "1595821651", "1595826106", "B001FB4W0C", "B000O77SMW", "B001AQO43M", "B000EWBNMS", "B0002XVKMM", "B000OIOPHC", "B002JVWRAO", "B000AQN894", "B005CM1IIE", "B000SQFC1S", "B002U8XW9Q", "1595825584", "B00133QNSG", "B003L77GAQ", "B00005JLKB", "B000R7GKQE", "B00JF5G8WU", "B009LDCXNY", "B000P0I4P8", "B004YM6JI2", "B0030Y12AA", "B001MVWRMU", "B009LDCWWG", "B0017MO11O", "B000FP2OPY", "B000AJJNI6", "B000EBGFPY", "0789326302", "B009LDD5XQ", "B0000CABIJ", "B00009MEJT", "B000N6TYLW", "B000QDLSR0", "B009GNI3HY", "B00133QNS6", "B00005JM67", "B009LDD4V4", "B000W089VU", "B00133QNRW", "B0002Y0QV2", "B000CNE0SS", "160010343X", "B00EIL7E9C", "B000F8O2P6", "B00092A1J4", "B000AO9BSS", "B002N5N5MK", "B000GPIPTM", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B001AI774S", "B00BBXSPES", "B003R4ZMN6", "B00005JNOG", "B004X60QWO", "B00511N79O", "B003L77GGK", "B00AMDA2P8", "B001JAHRME", "1442412097", "B004FM2EQC", "B002JVWR4A", "B00006LPCK", "B0010YSD7M", "B0024FAD9C", "B000BOH98G"], "bought_together": ["B000EHSVMS", "B000EHSVLY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVKK", "B000EHSVMS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 130266}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 29.59, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B0000AQS18", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51UKk69E9GL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Fifth Season"}

{"description": "Though it bears little resemblance to the original 1969 thriller starring Michael Caine, the 2003 remake ofThe Italian Jobstands on its own as a caper comedy that's well above average. The title's a misnomer--this time it's actually a Los Angeles job--but the action's just as exciting as it propels a breezy tale of honor and dishonor among competing thieves. Inheriting Caine's role as ace heist-planner Charlie Croker, Mark Wahlberg plays straight-man to a well-cast team of accomplices, including Mos Def, Jason Statham, and scene-stealer Seth Green in a variation of the role originally played by Noel Coward. As the daughter of Croker's ill-fated mentor (Donald Sutherland), Charlize Theron is recruited to double-cross a double-crosser (Edward Norton in oily villain mode), and once again, speedily versatile Mini Coopers play a pivotal role in director F. Gary Gray's exhilarating car-chase climax. It's perhaps the greatest product placement in movie history, and just as fun the second time around.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB86A", "B00AEFY0XE", "B0000AUHPB", "B0019EXZY4", "B00004Z4WR", "B005LAIGLE", "B001MTYRKC", "B000ZS8GWQ", "B000J3OTT6", "B00AEBB8LA", "B000P0J0BK", "B00BB67UNW", "B004HO6HWA", "B004P7CMVE", "0767818024", "B004ULNJIU", "B003Q6D2B4", "B001F12J0C", "B001QB9H10", "B004EPYZP8", "B008E70EES", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B0062P3392", "B001TODCII", "B002GSXKP6", "B000BTITKS", "B0010YVCB6", "B000K7UBSO", "078322933X", "B001ILHY1I", "B0007P0XBO", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B003UESJHO", "B000AP04FG", "B0002ZDVEU", "B000JYW5BE", "B000W1V5VU", "B00008AOVL", "B00005JLIF", "B000093FLA", "6305657947", "6304711891", "B003L20IG0", "B00DU22OI6", "B005LAIGRS", "B008JFURII", "B002XMGGK6", "B002DU39GW", "B00HEPC0TS", "B005LAIILM", "B000P0J0C4", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000W9DTG6", "B000M341QE", "B002NZK5UU", "B000X1Z0C4", "B00AEFZ2DG", "B000FKO5QK", "B001UV4XGA", "B00023B1LC", "B000GFLKF8", "B00005JLSB", "B000ENC5YW", "B00AEFY5B6", "B001J710Z2", "B002ZG99H2", "B000VWYJ86", "B00005JN0T", "B002ZG999U", "6305428115", "B00000JGNP", "B00140PK82", "B002ZG9864", "B002GIBVVQ", "B004H83IFK", "B00BEIYLO8", "B00005UQ9T", "6304806434", "0783240295", "B005LAIGXW", "B00003CY0V", "B000KF0GWW", "B000P0J0EW", "B00005JLX2", "B002VECM6S", "B002ZG97RE", "B002O3Z4XY", "B000E5N684", "B002ZG980U", "B00005B6JZ", "B001N44BVQ", "B000FKO3WG", "B00005JKBC", "B007REV4T8", "B00E8RKHWW", "B001DZOC6Y", "B0012KJ0DK", "B002GHHHP6", "B00005JN0W", "B00AQSN7HE"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBB86A", "B00AEFY0XE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000AUHPB", "B00AEBB86A", "B00004Z4WR", "B005LAIIHG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8732}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B0000B1OFL", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X762iDLcL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Italian Job"}

{"description": "This 2001 Godzilla feature from Japan's Toho Studios, released as part of the mighty monster's 50th anniversary, is a visually impressive and action-packed entry in the long-running franchise, but also one with a fast and loose re-interpretation of its history that may displease some stalwart fans. Writer-director Shusuke Kaneko (who previously revitalized the Gamera series) erases everything that occurred after 1954'sGodzillaand re-imagines the beast as a mythical creature harboring the souls of the Japanese victims of World War II; its attack is challenged by three \"Guardian Monsters\": Mothra, perennial villain King Ghidorah (here reinvented as hero) and B-list player Baragon (fromFrankenstein Challenges the World). The retooling, while imaginative, is supported by spectacular special effects, but the monsters' brawls (a core reason for enjoying these films) seem abbreviated, and Kaneko's script experiences awkward seismic shifts from comedy to grim drama that may befuddle longtime G-fans. Columbia-Tri-Star's DVD is widescreen and offers Dolby Digital 5.1 sound and a Japanese language track (with English subtitles) that should please viewers with an aversion to dubbing. Trailers for other Sony/Columbia sci-fi titles like the AmericanGodzillafeature are also included.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001AVZ9Y", "B00003CXLS", "B0000VAGXK", "B00066KWCY", "B00003L9CB", "0767825489", "B0006SGYLK", "B00I462X7K", "B0088FS1DC", "B00I462Y60", "B009ERJY6G", "B000BMY2L0", "B00I462XF2", "B000P24FAE", "B00IQAUO48", "B00125WAYQ", "B000VXWK86", "B00IQAUO6Q", "B000OCY7IU", "B000MV8AJK", "B001AR0D40", "B00LNBQ8SI", "B00IQAUO2A", "B00003L9CE", "B00IQAUO5C", "B00125WAYG", "B000MV8AJU", "B00LMCDHMS", "B000OCY7IK", "B00JB08O76", "B00I099JO6", "B00I462XLG", "B00LNBQ8UG", "B00I462XNO", "B007WETMRY", "B00I462XGG", "B00I3C1T6G", "B005ENCIWG", "B000E1BXFG", "B00JQYUZSS", "B0024FAG2G", "B002HTCOCO", "0767817478", "B009ERK122", "B00JQYUXY4", "B00IE41A9O", "B0051WTODQ", "B0088FS27C", "B005VU9LKE", "B00I099JZK", "B007I1TFNM", "B00006FD9I", "B008L0YMSW", "B0002V7OE2", "B00KMO1210", "1401250351", "B00I3C1T7A", "B00K2CHVSK", "B00I099JWI", "B008R7BVTM", "B000FA4TLQ", "B002DQSKLU", "B00I099JY6", "1613777493", "B00LT1JHLW", "1608873447", "B00EL3W53M", "161377933X", "B0035CVB30", "B00006IUGR", "B00HFWETZ8", "B00LU4URS0", "B00IAO618S", "B005VU9LO0", "B00BG4RKL6", "B00LMBURDG", "B003NHMYJC", "B00GV2Z9F2", "B003NHMYJM", "B00LMBUR6S", "1631400096", "B00C0VTLOS", "B00JC66OIA", "B004G5SOYO", "B0002B15WY", "B000EXZKR6", "1404999256", "B0040HYLF4", "B00D3Y18WO", "B0000039LO", "B00KI2CE4K", "B004GGU9M8", "B00164EAC8", "1613772238", "B0093QC3SY", "0762454067", "B00LFN00GU", "B000EHQTZO"], "bought_together": ["B0001AVZ9Y", "B00003CXLS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000VXWK86", "B00003CXLS", "B00I462Y60", "B00I462X7K"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 26439}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 22.99, "brand": "Godzilla", "asin": "B0000VAGXU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51woPaL%2Bo0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack"}

{"description": "As upscale sitcoms go,Something's Gotta Givehas more to offer than most romantic comedies. Obviously working through some semi-autobiographical issues regarding \"women of a certain age,\" writer-director Nancy Meyers brings adequate credibility and above-average intelligence to what is essentially (but not exclusively) a fantasy premise, in which an aging lothario who's always dated younger women (Jack Nicholson, more or less playing himself) falls for a successful middle-aged playwright (Diane Keaton) who's convinced she's past the age of romance, much less sexual re-awakening. As long as old pals Nicholson and Keaton are on screen discussing their dilemma or discovering their mutual desire,Something's Gotta Giveis terrific, proving (in case anyone had forgotten) that Hollywood can and should aim for an older demographic. Myers falls short with the sitcom device of a younger lover (Keanu Reeves) who wants Keaton as much as Nicholson does; it's believable but shallow and too easily dismissed. Myers also skimps on supporting roles for Frances McDormand, Amanda Peet, and Jon Favreau, but thankfully this is one romantic comedy that doesn't pander to youth. Mature viewers, rejoice!--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0038N9WKU", "0767811100", "B000MQC9H4", "B000YAF4MA", "B000OCZA04", "B0038N9X40", "B00AEFXYOA", "B00AEBB9WI", "B0000YTP1G", "B00AEBB8YW", "B000EMGJ7C", "B000YDBPAM", "B0000VD02Y", "B000023VTP", "B000EHRVOW", "B0009OL7Z4", "B00005JLSK", "B000XJD33O", "B0000542C9", "B00AEBB8NS", "B001ECDVK4", "B00006FMUW", "6304765266", "B004SEUJK0", "B003ASLJK4", "B0000AOV4I", "6305236569", "B002VECM6S", "B002K0WBXW", "B00008G7UF", "B000J103OI", "B0042816YK", "B00081U7HC", "6305213283", "B004SIP9RO", "B003BV8ICC", "B0015I2RT8", "078322740X", "6305212112", "B008R65XWO", "6305657947", "B0017ANAZO", "B0000JBALO", "B00EIBO8T6", "B00AEFYHVO", "B00005JNDZ", "B0099114WO", "B0088X7Z6S", "B007JNR54A", "B00005JPSM", "076784744X", "B002ZG988M", "B00386EZKE", "B000683VI4", "B00AEBB9FA", "B004EPZ070", "B00003CXSM", "B00AEFY99O", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00005JG6N", "0783226772", "B000JYW5B4", "B003Y5H574", "B0038N9X3Q", "B002GHHHGU", "B000CCW2P2", "B00004TJKK", "B0017ANB08", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B000P0J0EW", "B004SIP8LG", "B000A343RI", "079073219X", "B0045HCJJ4", "B000CCBCAS", "B000HEWEE4", "0792833198", "B000765IJK", "B0002I84N0", "B001DDBCUA", "6304907729", "B003Y5H524", "B000ENC5YW", "B0007IO6NM", "B005S9EJ14", "B004FQX5B6", "B000HEWEJO", "B0001I55M4", "B00003CXFV", "B00005JLH0", "B00DDT0JB0", "B002U4UYYQ", "B00DW5ILUG", "B00005JN3W", "B00006ZXSO", "B00007E2F5", "B004SIP9VA", "B00118T632", "B004A8ZWSS"], "bought_together": ["B0038N9WKU", "B000MQC9H4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0038N9WKU", "0767811100", "B000MQC9H4", "B00AEBB9WI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2886}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.79, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0001AVZA8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q5RC1103L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Something's Gotta Give"}
{"description": "This two-disc set certainly improves upon the fluffyReloadedDVD release. Although there's still no Wachowski brothers talking about their creation, there's a lot of good stuff here in the three main segments. We are constantly reminded how long the back-to-back filming schedule was, and it's most interesting to hear from the actors and artists as they come to the end of this long road. When a white rabbit flashes on screen, you can \"branch\" the most interesting documentary footage: how \"bullet time\" is being recalibrated and how you go about replicating so many Agent Smiths. A timeline is wonderfully put together, but cumbersome to navigate through.

{"description": "Somebody smart produced the director's commentary track forBig  Fish; they brought in an interviewer to keep Tim Burton on track, thus  avoiding those moments when a director gapes silently at his movie,  grasping for some fresh thought. This sense of control, however, fosters a  somewhat corporate atmosphere, which also infests the typically fatuous  featurettes about \"The Character's Journey\" and \"The Filmmakers' Path.\"  Which is not to say they're a waste: Ewan McGregor is simply the most  charming man in the world; the various beasties in the movie are  technically interesting; and there's an interesting bit about the author  of the book and the screenwriter, usually two of the most ignored figures  in cinema.

{"description": "Upstaging the neorealist masterworks of Rossellini and Bertolucci, Gianni Amelio&#x92;s Lamerica triumphs. A visually arresting tale of moral conflict and the journey that leads to atonement, Lamerica has been hailed by critics everywhere as one of the best films of this past decade.After nearly half a century of communist rule, a poverty stricken Albania falls subject to the invasion of two exploitive capitalists looking to prosper within the changing economy. As Albania&#x92;s people try desperately to flee destitution, Gino (Enrico Lo Verso) and Fiore arrive from Italy with plans to use a makeshift manufacturing plant to front their next scam. Forced to name an Albanian citizen as their company&#x92;s acting \"chairman,\" Gino and Fiore turn to Spiro&#x96;a prisoner of war for over fifty years, Spiro emerges as the perfect pawn. However, when Spiro suddenly disappears, Gino finds himself on a journey that will ultimately reshape the integrity of his soul.  Beautifully photographed in Cinemascope, Lamerica has garnered director Gianni Amelio (Stolen Children and Open Doors) with a record third consecutive Felix Award for Best European Film.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00HRJVHEK", "B000NHG81U", "0767837363", "B00008ZZ9K", "B000067IXK", "B0007P0XNC", "B003YKVGMO", "B001DDBDE0", "B0011UR8VW", "B003G127EM", "B000E1OI94", "B008OIQKT0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00GNAXPQW", "B0009A404I", "B000NHG81U"]}, "price": 17.21, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 313372}, "asin": "B0001Y4LD2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RT353CTKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lamerica"}

{"description": "There is no drop-off in laughs from thefirstto second volume of Will Ferrell's work onSaturday Night Live. Giggle along with his recurring characters, including James Lipton (interviewing Kate Hudson as a wonderfully ditzy Drew Barrymore), a wickedly clever George W. Bush, and one-half of the smarmy Lovers couple. This volume spotlights Ferrell's ability to go successfully over-the-top whether as an overbearing boss (check out how long he keeps stabbing a doomed coworker), a strict airplane pilot, an absent-minded doctor, or the world's oldest baby. There's plenty of unabashed (near) nudity and risky violence, which keeps the SNL tradition of \"Not Ready for Prime Time\"; check out what longtime hosts of the morning talk show resort to when the much-needed teleprompter fails. All that plus \"Janet Reno's Dance Party\" (with guest Rudy Giuliani) makes this the perfect pick-up for those who could not get enough of Ferrell with volume 1.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003LXM1QE", "B0002I84FI", "B0006FFRSE", "B0000C2IQW", "B00014K5BO", "B0041QSZGA", "B00014NEAI", "B002NALPLS", "B0002I84EE", "B000EPFDDU", "B0002I84EO", "B0000A1HPO", "B0000A1HPQ", "B0000C2IUC", "B000LXGXXE", "B007X1K450", "B003INBO60", "B000CCD0GM", "B00014NE9E", "B000CCD0GW", "B000A6T22G", "B000A6T230", "B000A6T22Q", "B0009A408E", "B0000C2IUO", "B003VE5E6W", "B0009A407U", "B000ZOXDFU", "B00014K5CI", "B0016MOV92", "B002IKIHEG", "B000H5U6HK", "B001G5T6GW", "B0002I84EY", "B00AEFYS2M", "B0013LRKQC", "B001FFBI9G", "B00103589Y", "B001MA5P5M", "B000EPFDDK", "B00018YCIM", "157362862X", "B00HFSHB3Y", "B00014NE9Y", "B0000TPA60", "B000A6T23A", "B0000C2IUL", "B000F0UUL4", "B0002KPHVU", "B002ZG99H2", "B000VNMMVG", "B0000APVGH", "B0083XXWRE", "B008220BGQ", "B000ADWDE8", "B00005UQ9W", "B00005JMYI", "B00005JM3G", "B003Y7F1PU", "B00AEFXJS6", "B000JLPMPS", "B000ARTMW0"], "bought_together": ["B003LXM1QE", "B0002I84FI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002I84FI", "B003LXM1QE", "B0000C2IQW", "B0041QSZGA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 66849}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "LIONS GATE HOME ENT.", "asin": "B0002I84F8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AYxFdJKgL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Saturday Night Live - The Best of Will Ferrell - Volume 2"}
{"description": "The cutting wit of Tina Fey (the first female head writer forSaturday Night Live) brilliantly fuses pop culture and smart satire. Fey wroteMean Girls, in which a formerly home-schooled girl named Cady (Lindsay Lohan) gets dropped into the sneaky, vicious world of the Plastics, three adolescent glamour-girls who dominate their public high school's social hierarchy. Cady first befriends a couple of art-punk outsiders who persuade her to infiltrate the Plastics and destroy them from within--but power corrupts, and Cady soon finds the glory of being a Plastic to be seductive.Mean Girlsjoins the ranks ofClueless,Bring It On, andHeathers, cunning movies that use the hormone-pressurized high school milieu to put the dark impulses of human nature--ambition, envy, lust, revenge--under a comic microscope. Fey manages to skewer everyone without forgetting the characters' hapless humanity; it's a dazzling and delightful balancing act.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFXO8Q", "B0036TGSIK", "B00AEBB8R4", "B00AEFYMBO", "B008JFUUIA", "B00005JMCW", "B000J4QW7W", "B00003CXMP", "B00005O5CM", "B00466HN7M", "B00441GYVK", "B00005JN0Z", "B0018CNNV2", "B00447L4KA", "B00AG473GE", "B001AEF6BS", "B003Y5H574", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00008K7AM", "B000CEV3KU", "B00006ZXSL", "B001AEF6BI", "B001OQCUYI", "B0000DIXDR", "B0053TWVQ4", "B00AEFY99O", "B003NHRIVQ", "B00AEBBA2M", "B000GB775E", "B001BL96K2", "B00E8RKHWW", "B004SIP9X8", "B00AEFXUXU", "B001H1I8KK", "B0007LXPBI", "B0007LXPBS", "B006X08DZ0", "B00001PE4D", "B000324Y98", "B006TTC50Y", "B000YAA68C", "B00002SSKI", "B000P0J0A6", "B002GIBVQ6", "6305428425", "B00000F0AD", "B00164KYV4", "B00007E2F5", "B000FCW15A", "B0035Q637K", "B000683VI4", "B003Y5H52O", "B00005JM55", "B00062IVN0", "B00005MEVO", "B00AEFY5TI", "B004EPYZU8", "B0002VYOVI", "B001MM3AZM", "B004EPZ0BG", "B00AMEZDJW", "B005Z9MFRC", "B000J103OI", "B000FS9MXI", "B0041KKYGU", "B0007PALZ2", "B004P7CN7W", "B000P0J09W", "6302077818", "B00005JNBQ", "B003TY2SWC", "B00AEBB9F0", "B002ZG989G", "B001UV4XUG", "0783235070", "B002ZG9968", "B000A2X3U2", "B004EPZ084", "B002DOBGWM", "B00AEFXZJE", "B0001I563M", "B0009OL7Z4", "B00028HBES", "B00404ME2Y", "B002ZG976U", "B003B3V0N4", "B0007PLLBU", "B000AM4P9A", "B005LAII12", "B002K0WBXW", "B00AEFXE9U", "B000Z8GZYW", "B00AEFYQE2", "B003B1X85O", "B00081U7HC", "B00AEFY0F2", "B003Y5H5B0", "B000YDBPAM", "B00004Y2R1", "B0006TPE4C"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFXO8Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008JFUUIA", "B0036TGSIK", "B00AEBB8R4", "B00466HN7M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 81958}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.97, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B0002IQJ8W", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510H7MK4TXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mean Girls (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "When a movie can blend passionate social concern with good old-fashioned suspense, it must be doing something right.Maria Full of Gracescores high on both counts. Maria is a Colombian teenager who, for a large paycheck, agrees to be a mule for drug-runners:  she has to swallow dozens of thumb-sized capsules of heroin and smuggle them into New York. This debilitating process is painstakingly described, and of course not everything goes as planned when Maria and her fellow mules land in America. Director Joshua Marston is working on a low budget, which explains the film's narrow, single-minded focus--but this may be a strength, not a weakness. The trump card is the lead performance of Catalina Sandrino Moreno, who won awards at the Seattle and Newport Film Festivals. Her empathetic face carries us along on Maria's journey, and humanizes a problem that is too easily relegated to a headline.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002FHGESI", "B00005JNCZ", "B0041KKYF6", "B000N3T0DW", "B00080Z53O", "B000O76ZQC", "B00005N8A9", "B00180IPM6", "B00008AOX5", "B0036TGSJE", "B008S2NABI", "B000YIGNCC", "B0007NBJHI", "B0042EJDGM", "B000RHRGSK", "B00AZMFKXK", "B005HFI7IU", "B000LV6OC6", "B00005JL57", "B0015ET3YO", "B003A0T8BO", "B004XVMCMG", "B000WC38IC", "B002M2T1VI", "B000N3SU6K", "B001ILTUKQ", "B0052LE7C4", "B005FIXA6S", "B002E01LOI", "B00GJNQ3S0", "B0047685T6", "B00075VX2C", "B00005JLQW", "B000AM4P90", "B001UV4XC4", "B004SIP7S0", "B00006G8G3", "B004SIP6GI", "B00005LZOD", "B0011FLH14", "B004MNM1FI", "B002M2T1V8", "B0086900LG", "B002BWP3UC", "B00E5G03KM", "B000AYEIDQ", "B00134PSV8", "B001FOPOD8", "B0000AMU29", "B00003CXRG", "B0014BQR6U", "B000274TLW", "B000LXHFMW", "B0000C9JFO", "B0001CNQX0", "B00004U1FA", "B00E1S1MMM", "B007961SAE", "B000GETTJI", "B004IF4EVY", "B00F6Y3E26", "B0032AJVE6", "B003O3EKRO", "B003X3BYJM", "B0009HLC9W", "B0000714BS", "B00000F5KH", "B002VECLXC", "B0000714BQ", "B0009S4IGK", "B002FUI4CE", "B00006BS7S", "B00APUAKYG", "B000K2V7F0", "B000SLYE6M", "0764146076", "B0000A2ZTY", "B0002VEZ3U", "1444137697", "B001M5BF7Y", "B000KJU15U", "B001Q56XOA", "B001QX014A", "0070020698", "B001S400C0", "B000VXUW0E", "B00H1RMPH6", "B000QYKDFC", "B000067IZ3", "B000JBXH78", "B00IQIAL8Y", "B007L6VPXC", "B0051T46YG", "B0002DRDIW", "B002EZLPOO", "B000N3T0DM", "B0002RQ316", "B0000U0X20", "B0013HL6ES"], "bought_together": ["B000O76ZQC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00180IPM6", "B0036TGSJE", "B005HFI7IU", "B000O76ZQC"]}, "price": 4.09, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3577}, "asin": "B0002TT0MI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51o4PdGtr3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Maria Full of Grace"}

{"description": "A cross between a KosherShaftandAirplane!'s shameless gag machine,The Hebrew Hammeris an unabashed burlesque about a streetwise Jewish private detective (a \"circumcised dick\" in his own parlance) named Mordechai Jefferson Carver (Adam Goldberg). Once ostracized by Gentile children, Mordechai has become a much-feared defender of Jews, so extreme that even the militant Jewish Justice League tosses him out. Until, that is, JJL leader Chief Bloomenbergansteinhal (Peter Coyote) and his lovely daughter Esther (Judy Greer) recruit him to take on the wicked Damien (Andy Dick), a snippy anti-Semite who murders Santa Claus in order to turn Christmas into a Jew-hating holiday. Written and directed by Jonathan Kesselman, this sporadically funny feature is based on a funkier short (included on this DVD) of the same name. The cast is better than the generally obvious material, and Nora Dunn (as Mordechai's mother) and Mario Van Peebles are very good in supporting roles.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FWHVL4", "B006ZL1PMU", "B000BYA4J2", "B0000C8ROV", "B00363WGF0", "B00003CXHG", "B001DPHDB0", "B00IUOH1EG", "B000071ZZJ", "B000JLQPZE", "B001DPHD9C", "B002BWP3W0", "B00000J122", "B00BX49CME", "B002DHACSS", "B00H96KG2U", "0843172452", "B000BGH2M2", "0452296447", "B0083H6AWE", "B00DSAUN9M", "B004HJ0ZTQ", "0767821513", "B006GQTYCC", "B0038ZHX9K", "B000FKVOEQ", "B000RPCK2E", "B000KG4BD6", "B000056HP4", "B000J09LH4", "B00005V4XW", "B006OT0UUQ", "0671034812", "B004XM38CS", "B0015OKWKI", "B000C3L2NE", "B001E75QHU", "B0001EFTVA", "B0089AJELY"], "bought_together": ["B000FWHVL4", "B006ZL1PMU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FWHVL4", "B006ZL1PMU", "B0000C8ROV", "B000BGH2M2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 73696}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 7.0, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B0002WZTQQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EG8rXufTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Hebrew Hammer"}
{"description": "Startling and powerful,Control Roomis a documentary about the Arab television network Al-Jazeera's coverage of the U.S.-led Iraqi war, and conflicts that arose in managed perceptions of truth between that news media outlet and the American military. Egyptian-American filmmaker Jehane Noujaim (Startup.com) catches the frantic action at Al-Jazeera headquarters as President Bush stipulates his 48-hour, get-out-of-town warning to Saddam Hussein and sons, soon followed by the network's shocking footage of Iraqi civilians terrorized and killed by invading U.S. troops. Al-Jazeera's determination to show images and report details outside the Pentagon's carefully controlled information flow draws the wrath of American officials, who accuse it of being an al-Qaida propagandist. (The killing of an Al-Jazeera reporter in what appears to be a deliberately targeted air strike is horrifying.) Most fascinating is the wayControl Roomallows well-meaning, Western-educated, pro-democratic Arabs an opportunity to express views on Iraq as they see it--in an international context, and in a way most Americans never hear about.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001MFNB5I", "B001KP2J2G", "B0002HDXTQ", "B0001L3LUE", "B000NIVJH2", "B000LP5CX4", "B0001907AI", "B000YMDIZS", "B006ML50QK", "B00DPUB5LK", "B000YIGND6", "B000FWHW7C", "B001BEK8FQ", "B001MVWFAO", "B005D0RD98", "B001WAKOW6", "B000A2XCBC", "B00008DDVV", "B0060ZJ7DA", "B0030Y11XS", "B000CEXEWA", "B00AZMFM3I", "B000O76ZOY", "B000WP07F6", "B00094ARN2", "B000E0OE44", "B00H9KKGTO", "B001GLX6UI", "B001KVZ6AM", "B006DHATE6", "B000E1NXJ0", "B0059XTTW8", "B00GYG8BKK", "B000059TFO", "1451613520", "B00005JN0W", "B00074DXFS"], "bought_together": ["B001MFNB5I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00701QYIE", "0802117899", "0813341493", "B005D0RD98"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 43437}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.63, "brand": "LION&#39;S GATE ENTERTAINMENT", "asin": "B0002X8U4I", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q2S5V4J2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Control Room"}
{"description": "With less drama and more slapstick than its predecessor, Disney'sMulan IIcontinues the animated saga of the young Chinese heroine, Fa Mulan (voiced by Ming-Na Wen, sung by Lea Salonga). The story picks up one month after Mulan has saved her country through bravery and determination. Revered by all, she now returns to her village and becomes engaged to General Li Shang. Wedding plans must wait, however, when the Emperor assigns the couple to a secret mission to escort his three princess daughters across China where their arranged marriages to waiting princes will secure an alliance with a rival kingdom and save China from invasion. Meanwhile, Mulan's wise-cracking guardian dragon, Mushu (voiced by Mark Moseley), realizes that if Mulan's marriage takes place, he is out of a job and so he undertakes his \"18-phase master plan\" of relationship sabotage to breakup the happy couple. Most of the film's jokes come from Moseley's Mushu (as quick-witted as Eddie Murphy's earlier performance), while a trio of prankish soldiers provide additional comic relief. While the film's overall effort is not as sensational as the original, it offers solid family entertainment, healthy female role models, and a handful of catchy songs.

{"description": "A big, bruising epic of the Korean War,Tae Guk Gismashed box-office records when it played in South Korea in 2004, almost as though the country needed to re-live the trauma at a 50-year distance. For the rest of the world,  this movie looks like a ground-level reckoning in a melodramatic key, with an authentic feel for battle lines as well as home front.Tae Guk Gifollows two brothers--one uneducated and forceful, the other intellectual and reserved--as they are united and then divided by the conflict. The broadly emotional story has some of the power of tales of the American Civil War, when family members found themselves on opposite sides of a battle. Director Kang Je-gyu , who made the lively female-assassin hitShiri, takes a blunt approach to the material (including aSaving Private Ryan-style framing device). And at 150 minutes, he has plenty of time for head-splitting, blood-spraying combat. This movie is meant as a punch in the stomach, and it connects.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0076XTIWU", "B007S0DCUU", "B003OXGW5M", "B004LE4FKM", "B008645YLM", "B0076XTFF0", "B006C1S1DY", "B007S0DB56", "B004H2CXBQ", "B004SJVQ4I", "B0009NZ78I", "B002QP145C", "B00C6WHPO4", "B00BTFK014", "B005E2YL3Q", "B00005AVZU", "B00A3TFMDI", "B0009S2T0M", "B00C2535TE", "B000NVT0RU", "B007WXUVHU", "B003Y7F1IW", "B0000633R6", "B005ZMBEXA", "B004GNBBVO", "B00D3XMA9A", "B00CLH09UQ", "B003JDQJM8", "B008645Z0M", "B0002J4X20", "B000GBEWNY", "B003NLE5JA", "B000BGH2A4", "B00BC1UPRO", "B003OXSRWI", "B00CG0YLS4", "B00CHYSSME", "B0019PL2W0", "B0099SI178", "B0030A6ICG", "B005OTGS4E", "B008OTTRE4", "B00A705TOU", "B0009XRZQK", "B00AN5LCOA", "B00D3XM7H0", "B005DKS1TE", "B0046YK4KW", "B00CAT3T8Y", "B004H2IMSO", "B0015DLZXM", "B00005U8F4", "B003EYEEI8", "B00005R87B", "B002C6VMIY", "B004P2VQZ2", "B00598YUOK", "B0011FDVGI", "B009VL2AZM", "B000E1EHPE", "B0035JHYHA", "B002P7UCJK", "B0051SFTGQ", "B005HG8VE4", "B000GSYRY6", "B001KEHAEE", "B009XTF8NI", "B00IVLR9JA", "B000P7V4MG", "B000A1OFZA", "B00HRYH52I", "B00772M1D8", "B007HCI42A", "B0009UKV5U", "B000GSE6H4", "B003PMWF62", "B00ENTX7JU", "9713727150", "B00576U9HQ", "B00ID8HATK", "B0001611CO", "B006UTDH6O", "B0000BWVCR", "B000E3LD5E", "B000PKG8TW", "B0082SIGR6", "B00ALCBTWU", "B003DVB7F0", "B00080ETYA", "B00CBDG4UY", "B004TXFFI6", "B000MGBLIC", "B00J5G1P2W", "B0036TGSV2", "B00004STDA", "B000MRA542", "B0014CKCE2", "B00C6WHSRI", "0792841662", "B005HQBO9I"], "bought_together": ["B007S0DCUU", "B0076XTIWU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007S0DCUU", "B0076XTIWU", "B004LE4FKM", "B00BC1UPRO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 35302}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.25, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0006VL1J2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K30W34ZFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tae Guk Gi - The Brotherhood of War"}
{"description": "Audiences were captivated by the women of Wisteria Lane in the first season ofDesperate Housewives, the breakout hit from ABC that almost single-handedly lifted the network from its ratings doldrums and brought back the classic TV soap, remixed now with satire, comedy, and mystery. An affectionate yet darkly tinged send-up of suburbia that skirtedTwin Peaksterritory as much as that ofKnots Landing,Desperate Housewivesopened with a bang--literally--as perfect-seeming housewife Mary Alice Young (Brenda Strong) went through her picture-perfect day before putting a handgun to her temple and pulling the trigger. Mary Alice's sudden suicide leaves her four closest friends, all housewives of a sort, with a surfeit of grief, a re-examination of their own lives, and a mystery to solve. It also proves to be a catalyst for a seamy study of what goes on inside the finely appointed homes of Wisteria Lane--the tales of which Mary Alice narrates from beyond the grave with a sardonic tone dipped in both honey and arsenic.There's Martha Stewart-perfect Bree (Marcia Cross), who rules her household with an iron fist in a tailor-made garden glove and seems to have it all, until she finds out her husband (Steven Culp) is cheating on her--and had a serious fetish habit to boot. Sultry Gaby (Eva Longoria), the youngest of the set, is a bored trophy wife whose predilection for shopping and clothes are the perfect decoy for her affair with the hunky teenage gardener (Jesse Metcalfe). Former career woman Lynette (Felicity Huffman) is the most stereotypical housewife, raising four (or was it five?) kids and frustrated at using her cutthroat business skills for suburban politics. And daffy Susan (Teri Hatcher), the divorcee looking for love, sees her prospects brighten with the arrival of hunky plumber Mike (James Denton), who has some desperate secrets of his own. And did we mention the neighborhood hussy (Nicollette Sheridan), the snotty busybody (Christine Estabrook), and Mary Alice's increasingly agitated son (Cody Kasch)?It was a fast and wild mix of plot and characters that gaveDesperate Housewivesthe zing that made it a number one hit, as it never got too bogged down in any dilemma before moving on to the next. And though it was neither as hard-hitting nor salacious as it was trumpeted to be, the show nevertheless breathed fresh, funny air into comedy television, for even though it hewed to the hour-long soap format, the content was far more dark comedy than sudsy drama. There were fun bright spots to be had, but the story behind Mary Alice's death--which included drugs, murder, blackmail, secret identities, and vengeance in equal amounts--hovered over all the characters, tingeing the farce with the specter of danger. The show's other source of strength is in its peerless ensemble cast, headed by four perfect leading ladies, all Emmy-worthy. Hatcher received the (deserved) lion's share of praise (and a Golden Globe), but her co-stars--especially the underrated Longoria--matched her scene for scene. And though the mystery of Mary Alice's death was ultimately solved (noTwin Peaksteasing here), it was just the beginning of the troubles on Wisteria Lane, where no life went unexamined for too long.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FIMG4U", "B000P6YNTI", "B0018CWEYO", "B001VPJYZK", "B003F3NDP8", "B003Y5HWGI", "B005Z28M58", "B0018CWEVW", "B00005JPII", "B000R7HRRA", "B003F3NE7K", "B0018CWEXA", "B00005JO9J", "B0001O3YLM", "B0018CWEZI", "B001VPJYZU", "B003L77G56", "B001VPJZ0E", "B003R0MEXQ", "B00G4RCNG2", "B003F3NDW6", "B0009IW88K", "B00684J49K", "B000P6YNSO", "B001L1S1SK", "B000FIMG5Y", "B000FUTVLO", "B000Q6GUKW", "B0077PTWX2", "B00166UFSY", "B0018CWEXK", "B000FFJYE8", "B003F3NDOE", "B00005JNEQ", "B00005JNOG", "B000AJJNI6", "B001VPJZ0O", "B003F3NE1Q", "B000TGURZ8", "B00369ERC4", "B0006IUE16", "B0002234R2", "B001MVWRNO", "B000CCBCGM", "B000GPIPTM", "B000QDLSR0", "B0002V7TZQ", "B000FUTVPA", "B001QE99AQ", "B002AMVED8", "1401302777", "B000EBGFPY", "B00684J49U", "B000GG4Y6O", "B003L77GEM", "B00004RFCM", "B000FVQLIO", "B000B5XOW0", "B001MVWRNE", "B000957O8C", "B00FR23PDU", "B00JF5GAZA", "B0000E5NPY", "B009RX7WTI", "B003R0MEW2", "B0009W5J4Q", "B001AQBGM4", "B0008JIJ1A", "B000H7JCGE", "B00382S9SW", "B001G0MFD8", "B000Q6GUW0", "B00AYVDUPW", "B0009CTVLS", "B000JLTRIG", "B009RX8GSE", "B001MVWRN4", "B001934SNM", "B004YM6JQO", "B000FIMG68", "B00382S9U0", "B0077PTWY6", "B002BAW6HW", "B0001IN0T4", "B0009K7QZ8", "B0009A407A", "B000NOKFGW", "B00JQF7ZR6", "B003L77GTC", "B0002MPQRS", "B00382S9UA", "B003FSTN4S", "B0081QF6Q8", "B0024FAD9C", "B000W6ZUUC", "B001B7CNZ6", "B000GTLQVW", "B0002RQ3MK", "B0077PTWHI"], "bought_together": ["B000FIMG4U", "B000P6YNTI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FIMG4U", "B000P6YNTI", "B0018CWEYO", "B003F3NDP8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12745}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 12.84, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00079FUI6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51OX-la6a%2BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Desperate Housewives - The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "French sensationThe Crimson Riverswas a serial killer thriller with a difference--it was genuinely thrilling. It was also pretty disturbing, but Jean Reno (The Professional) brought some light to the darkness with his sly performance as dog-phobic detective Ni&#xE9;mans. Fortunately, Reno has returned in this highly stylized Luc Besson-penned sequel. Vincent Cassell has not, but Beno&#xEE;t Magimel (The Piano Teacher), as new partner Reda, makes for a decent replacement. Alas, Olivier Dahan isn't in the same league as Matthieu Kassovitz and the story line, which has something to do with the Last Supper, the Maginot Line, and gravity-defying killer monks, is even more convoluted than before. Then there's Johnny Hallyday (The Man on the Train) as a mysterious one-eyed man and Christopher Lee (The Lord of the Rings) as a bad German dude. It's all a little ridiculous, but entertaining nonetheless, and the chase sequences are a treat.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "The Reivers, based on a William Faulkner novel, is a spirited comedy-drama starring Steve McQueen in a rare character part as Boon Hoggenbeck, a ne'er-do-well, turn-of-the-century Mississippi farm hand and cousin of 11-year-old naif Lucius McCaslin (Mitch Vogel). The arrival of a handsome new automobile purchased by Lucius' grandfather, Boss McCaslin (a golden performance by Will Geer), causes an uproar when Boon and another cousin, Ned McCaslin (Rupert Crosse), who is half African American, vie to drive the vehicle around town. Boss's departure by train for a funeral gives Boon, Ned, and Lucius an opportunity to drive in style to Memphis, where young McCaslin's eyes are opened to a larger world of hard-core racism, prostitution, corruption, and the tyranny of the powerful over the vulnerable. In short order, Lucius finds his innate decency and integrity lessen the sting of disillusionment and helplessness. Director Mark Rydell (On Golden Pond) keeps things brisk and breezy, but never loses sight of the long shadow of adulthood that blots out Lucius' innocence.

{"description": "Among the films that made the '70s an \"American Renaissance\" decade,Hustlemerits a place of honor. As vigorous as the groundbreaking work of such Young Turk contemporaries as Scorsese, Spielberg, and Coppola, its distinction lies in being a throwback to the '50s glory days of its director, Robert Aldrich, when he was making corrosive, Establishment-baiting classics likeAttack!andKiss Me Deadly. The same sardonic spirit, bracing socio-political anger, and bold, hard-edged moviemaking inform this look into the soul of Los Angeles by way of a murder investigation that may not, in fact, have a murder at its core.Steve Shagan wrote the script, and like his 1973Save the Tiger, this movie's central character is a burnt-out case with a nostalgia for lost values: an LAPD detective (Burt Reynolds) whose spiritual/ethical touchstones are film-noir Bogart and soft-focus French movies of the '60s. He should have a girlfriend played by Catherine Deneuve--and he does, a Deneuve whose first signs of aging on screen are an evocative element of the film. Her character is a high-class courtesan whose clients include a prominent attorney (Eddie Albert); he also appears to have had some connection with a 20-year-old hooker/druggie whose corpse just washed up on a California beach. Throw in Ben Johnson as the dead girl's seething war-veteran dad, Eileen Brennan as his wife, Paul Winfield and Ernest Borgnine as Reynolds's fellow cops, and you've got one potent ensemble. Reynolds isn't equal to the task of selling some of Shagan's most florid rhetoric (probably no actor would be), but he makes an honorable stab at it. And as an urbane power-broker who can contemplate an assassination while finishing his Cobb salad, the late Eddie Albert is chilling, just chilling.--Richard T.

{"description": "The charm, the zaniness, the corny jokes, the showbiz cliches--every element ofThe Muppet Showholds up 30 years after Jim Henson's legendary variety series' debut season. Well, perhaps not everything: Today's younger viewers might have a hard time placing some ofThe Muppet Show's then-guest stars, such as Florence Henderson or Ruth Buzzi. But then, theShow's real celebrities are perennial icons Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Gonzo the... whatever, Fozzie Bear, Animal, and the rest of the Muppets' harried, well-meaning family of entertainers.Season Onefinds the show pretty much in the basic shape longtime fans will remember: A musical introduction followed by backstage chaos, another musical number, a sketch, a scene with the guest star, and so on. A half-hour episode can fly by pretty quickly, but it's interesting to note that the series hadn't quite found its familiar tone through much of the first year. A reliance on too many disposable verbal jokes and redundant, so-so material for sketch fodder ultimately gives way to more creative premises and the development of key relationships between characters. By the final half-dozen episodes in the first season,The Muppet Showis truly cooking. Season highlights include Kermit's confession to guest Juliet Prowse that he always wanted to be a dancer, and Prowse's comparison of the little green superstar to Robert Redford. Joel Grey does a cabaret-style act for a roomful of Muppets and is later outraged when Kermit's introduction of the actor proves so thorough there is nothing left for the latter to say. Rita Moreno proves quite game in a funny piece, set in a French cafe, in which her dance with a man-size Muppet turns from romantic to table-smashing violent. Harvey Korman plays bumbling ringmaster Maurice the Magnificent, easily the worst animal trainer in history. Phyllis Diller bats out shameless one-liners (\"I sang 'Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star,' and it fell on me\"), and Vincent Price toys with his own horror film image by playing a ghoul who turns into a maudlin orchestra conductor at midnight.--Tom KeoghStills fromThe Muppet Show(click for larger image)The divine Miss PiggyKermit and Miss PiggyFozzie Bear and KermitSing along!Everyone's a critic", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000Q6774K", "B0013527I4", "B00CUEIP56", "B00CUDD0KW", "B004EPZ03O", "B000ATQYTW", "B00005JO4H", "B000ATQYTC", "B00EDUCO3O", "B00005BCJR", "B006JTS5OO", "0316182990", "B00I8VLDFE", "B0062DB7K6", "B00AP2DA9G", "B00BCMT4B6", "1465417486", "B0000A2ZU9", "B00I8VLE76", "B0052LE7BA", "B000ATQYT2", "B003XURDCC", "B0000844MM", "B000H6SY8C", "B000AA4F2O", "B00006AUHR", "B000UNYJTK", "B0052LE7A6", "B00H4RL2H2", "B00I8VLBZG", "B000CCBCA8", "B005UQHDPY", "0316277630", "B000H6SY1E", "B00B2ZZV5G", "0679412034", "B0062DCBZ6", "B00000JYLT", "B00IKSI1UU", "B0069RY7V6", "B008I218K8", "B006345IB8", "B00961EO1A", "B007KW5MJU", "B0001I55O2", "B0016MJ73W", "0345526112", "B0062KMDWU", "B0050MB5AC", "B00005JKTY", "B0000AYJXV", "B00465I1BA", "B002TJ23KA", "B000YERP2S", "B00961ENYI", "0316058432", "B006WNSHUY", "B00I6JOBTI", "B005F96UJ6", "B00B98HG18", "B009Z4W140"], "bought_together": ["B000Q6774K", "B0013527I4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000Q6774K", "B00CUEIP56", "B0013527I4", "B004EPZ03O"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8440}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 30.49, "brand": "Disney", "asin": "B0009ULBGS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5121HCDPQKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Muppet Show: Season 1"}

{"description": "When a baby girl appears on the doorstep of a Parisian apartment belonging to a trio of hedonistic bachelors, baby care is thrust upon them with hilarious and, ultimately, heartwarming results in this 1985 French comedy (with English subtitles) by writer/director Coline Serreau. Pierre, Michel, and Jacques are pleasure-seeking professionals with the singular goal to seduce women in their spare time. When Jacques leaves on a three-week vacation, a mix-up ensues and roommates Pierre and Michel (Roland Giraud and Michel Boujenah, respectively) discover that the \"package\" Jacques has enlisted them to watch in his absence is a cooing infant in a pink bassinette. With no prior experience and unable to contact Jacques (Andr&#xE9; Dussollier) to whom the baby was \"addressed,\" they dive into the frenzied fracas of diapers and feeding schedules. Adding insult to insanity, they must fend off drug dealers&#x97;and police--interested in another \"package.\" The simple storyline leaves plenty of room for shenanigans&#x97;formulaic perhaps, but still irresistible. Rather than a morality play on the recklessness of child abandonment, farcical comedy prevails. Over time, the men are smitten with little Marie who gives them plenty of adorable moments until they can't live without her. The obvious appeal of the story inspired the American remake two years later, though the French version is more compelling, nuanced, and touching. Parents should take note of the PG-13 rating for excessive profanity and sexual content.

{"description": "Home to some of the world's best food and fashion, the French also have the wonderful habit of producing some of the world's best movies. WithHigh Tension, French director Alexandre Aja offers up a bloody buffet of terror; a violent concoction of style over substance, with a bloody French twist.       Two college girlfriends, Maria and Alex, take a weekend to study at the secluded country home of Alex's parents.   Shortly after their arrival, a mysterious killer appears, and things take a shockingly terrible turn for the worse. As the horror and body count rises, Maria and Alex find themselves fighting for their lives, and it's revealed that things are not exactly as they seem.     Essentially a one-act cat-and-mouse affair,High Tensionis an explosive bloody thrill ride that rarely lets up.   Oozing style in every color-saturated frame and boasting some intense performances, Aja mainly succeeds in sustaining an intense momentum throughout the film.  The plot occasionally suffers from a thin, flimsy storyline, and the abundant graphic scenes of violence will either thrill and delight, or simply disgust.   Nonetheless, this adrenalin-fueled addition to the genre gives the American slasher flick a real run for its money.High Tensionis high-art horror, and comes highly recommended.--Matt Wold", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001MEJY8W", "B0014VPFVS", "B00125WATQ", "B000EOTVU2", "B000GI3KGC", "B0009WFEDC", "B002EOVXBK", "B00GGY4R3K", "B001G9CNI6", "B00005K9O8", "B000WC38EQ", "B00009W0U4", "B000X1RYEQ", "B0041KKYCY", "B004AC6PV2", "B000EHRVP6", "B0028DRGDQ", "B000N3AW6G", "B005SQRYB4", "B001MFNB4O", "B000GSYRY6", "B000IHY9TS", "B000S0GYRU", "B00009MEC4", "B00187FPC2", "B001D2WU9I", "B0000CABGW", "B001B187L6", "B00G5GNYY2", "B008G1JIQC", "B001JV5BIA", "B002LMSWN2", "B000WC389G", "B0082A3HFK", "B002OVO18A", "B004P2VQZ2", "B00699G622", "B0009OUBC4", "B008JFUNYG", "B000FS9FE4", "B004EI2NP4", "B0013D8L7M", "B008NNY8XQ", "B000GI3RHY", "B00J81S92S", "B001D5C1OO", "B0031U8OEK", "B00196UTEG", "B006QWC2ZC", "B008WAM2E2", "B0015ET3YO", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000MM0LIM", "B00BSU0FQA", "B008BM5WQG", "B00AJLHUA8", "B000GLL1U6", "B003Q6D246", "B0083H6B0U", "B00006FDBW", "B001MVYUR0", "B000IMUYJM", "B00DMUFXOS", "B0021L8UPS", "B000099T3M", "B00CU00JTU", "B003L20IEC", "B0051CSIKQ", "B000NVT0TI", "B00DPUB5EW", "B001D5C1R6", "B00C7C00JU", "B000VKL6Z2", "B006U49SC6", "B0052DP1RC", "B00AZTUUQK", "B002DKGWSE", "B000FZEQWI", "B000RW5BZ0", "B0001611DI", "B0057O6IMS", "B00111YM5Q", "B00177YA6U", "B000UW8596", "B005ER6STG", "B0007WQHI0", "B00079HZY8", "B0009S2T0M", "B00005Q4CS", "B000PKG8TW", "B00006AUIG", "B000AXWHSA", "B001RTKKQW", "B003KGBISE", "B008G33PIM", "B004KDYR20", "6305228876", "B000PMLJMQ", "B002YICNE2", "B0060AAMEI"], "bought_together": ["B001MEJY8W", "B0014VPFVS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001MEJY8W", "B0014VPFVS", "B00GGY4R3K", "B000GI3KGC"]}, "price": 8.37, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23934}, "asin": "B000ARFPMQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K3uQHsEXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "High Tension (Unrated Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "More than merely a sports documentary or an inspirational profile of triumph over adversity, \"Murderball\" offers a refreshing and progressive attitude toward disability while telling unforgettable stories about uniquely admirable people. It's ostensibly a film about quadriplegic rugby (or \"Murderball,\" as it was formerly known), in which players with at least \"some\" loss of physical function in all four limbs navigate modified wheelchairs in a hardcore, full-contact sport that takes them all the way to the Paralympic Games in Athens, Greece, in 2004. But as we get to know paralyzed or amputee players on Team USA like Andy Cohn, Scott Hogsett, Bob Lujano and charismatic team spokesman Mark Zupan, we come to understand that quad rugby is a saving grace for these determined competitors, who battle Team Canada coach (and former Team USA superstar) Joe Soares en route to the climactic contest in Athens. Simply put, \"Murderball\" is the best film to date about living with a severe disability, but codirectors Henry Alex Rubin and Dana Adam Shapiro avoid the sappy, inspirational sentiment that hampers nearly all mainstream films involving disability. By the time this blazing 85-minute film reaches its emotional conclusion, the issue of disability is almost irrelevant; these guys are as normal as anyone, and their life stories led to \"Murderball\" becoming the most critically acclaimed documentary of 2005. \"--Jeff Shannon\"", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002KE5VUS", "B000XQ4HR8", "B0007WFYBG", "B001E5FYS8", "B009YQJ2Q4", "B004YEMK7O", "B000BMY2NS", "B00005RIY3", "B00DUX290S", "B006JN8748", "B0007V6IUS", "B000A2XCBC", "B00007ELEK", "B008SGVSMM", "B00GV8B0OA", "B00GMV8DFU", "B00005JNV9", "B004YCKKIM", "B004U7MR1Y", "0786881623", "B0003JAO8Q", "B000CDSS18", "B0012LDNIC", "B002PLMJ74", "B00EPD3CC6", "0767846869", "B00DVLKMWQ", "B0000SXK0Y", "B0013LRKYO", "B001QTVP8A", "159486845X", "0472032364", "B00022FW4U", "0812924126", "B00AEK9BKQ", "B000189DZE", "0767821432", "B0001L3LUE", "B000MZGN40", "B004UXUV98", "B004IOPDJ2", "0803621795", "B008IG09FO", "0679728244", "B0087OULO6", "B002LE8MP8", "B000A3XY5A", "0240812417", "B00A92MGLA", "B0000WN13Q", "0470619007", "1932603336", "B000ELL1RG", "B0038M2AZA", "B00375LBK8", "1401812325", "B00CTBQUIE", "0814785646", "B002TVQ48A", "0807022020", "B0027BOL4G", "B008VR7U8O", "B001BEK8FQ", "B005S9EIGU", "B000FIMG7C", "B00009YXAS", "B001QIP5C8", "0814757286", "B00A4TMLKE", "B00020X94W", "B000GBEWMA", "B00005KHJY", "B0002OXVBO", "B007CEFTSA", "0781783518", "B0000YEEGM", "B00008DDVV", "B007UW9WOQ", "B002E01LOI", "0800177258", "B008JFUTT0", "B00AIBZKFG", "B0087IT8FK", "B004CJQVQC", "B00AEFZ63M", "B000E1NXJ0", "0822351110", "B001EP8EOY"], "bought_together": ["B000XQ4HR8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000GG1F4S", "B000XQ4HR8", "B001E5FYS8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 89146}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.89, "brand": "THINKFILM LLC", "asin": "B000B5XP24", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61YKSQPQ5PL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Murderball"}

{"description": "The first half ofBattlestar Galactica's second season left no doubts about the continuing excellence of the best science fiction TV series of 2005. Beginning with the Colonial Fleet separated, Col. Tigh (Michael Hogan) botching his temporary command, and Capt. Adama (Edward James Olmos) near death after a Cylon assassination attempt, series producer/developer Ronald D. Moore and his gifted writing staff packed more into these 10 episodes than most series manage in a full season. Maintaining its reputation as an adult drama, the series is compellingly anchored by the gravitas of Olmos and Mary McDonnell, whose role as Fleet President Laura Roslin grows more complex as she reveals her diagnosis of breast cancer and defies Adama, playing the \"religious card\" with her conviction that prophetic visions will lead the embattled fleet toward its legendary home planet Earth. As Adama's son Apollo (Jamie Bamber) wrestles with his role in Roslin's mutinous agenda, paranoia runs high as Cylon copies (or \"avatars\") of Boomer (Grace Park) complicate matters aboard Galactica and on Kobol, where a lost Raptor crew struggles to survive and Dr. Baltar (James Callis) endures the increasingly haunting and manipulative intrusions into his tormented psyche by Number Six (Tricia Helfer), the seductive Cylon who holds the secret to the Cylon master plan to destroy humankind.Further action takes place on Cylon-occupied Caprica, where Starbuck (Katee Sackhoff) and Helo (Tamoh Penikett) discover a group of human resistance fighters who survived the Cylons' nuclear attack in season 1. As all of these plot threads are expertly interwoven, the high-stakes conflict ofBG 2.0culminates in a suspenseful mid-season cliffhanger. Through all of this,Battlestar Galacticamaintains consistently high standards of intelligent drama and well-justified, story-based use of spectacular special effects, while developing rich relationships across a broad spectrum of interesting supporting characters. The series' large and likable cast is well-used throughout (even smaller roles are given adequate dimension), and Moore's \"podcast\" commentaries provide a smart, thorough analysis of the show's writing process and conceptual evolution. Yes, it's undeniably true that this half-season DVD set is a blatantly commercial ploy to lure more and more viewers into the ongoing season (which resumed in January 2006), but you can hardly blame Universal for capitalizing on a high-quality series. With solid ratings, good scripts, and a devoted cast and crew,Battlestar Galacticashowed every indication of thriving toward a third season and beyond.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001HUWQEA", "B00129W6LE", "B000AJJNFE", "B002HRF68A", "B000V5IP6K", "B002ZCY872", "B00A3717C0", "B00466H3A4", "B00064AFBE", "B001RTCP1U", "B002JE43O4", "B000W4KT9G", "B003RR991Y", "B00GX7D5G0", "B002HRF7AW", "B003H9LIYS", "B00A3718IS", "B0000AFX64", "B00C7MW5SE", "B00344EAFK", "B001B7CNZ6", "B000QDLSR0", "B000UZ4C4A", "B000F8O2OM", "B000F8O2OW", "B00IWTVDUW", "B000F8O2P6", "1417078723", "B005PPMHWE", "B0024FAD9C", "B00005JNOG", "B00242KD1S", "B0032JTUX4", "B002BAW6GS", "B002N5N5MK", "B000BW7QWW", "B00BD6K54G", "B0007TKH66", "B003H9LIRK", "B0017MO10U", "B002BAW6GI", "B000A9QKRI", "B000FCUYKO", "6303961614", "B004EXWGHY", "B00F6WXPSQ", "B003L77GWE", "B000F8O2Q0", "B0009Q0F5U", "B003L77GUG", "B004HYW84G", "B000LC4ZI0", "B000B8IA2G", "B007USE5CE", "B0002PYS7Y", "B002BWP2IK", "B001RHGRTS", "B0000AQS0F", "B002BAW6FE", "B000F8O2PG", "B00243FQFA", "B000HEZEY6", "B000FIMG68", "B00E3QJ7JC", "B000F8O2PQ", "B000B837XI", "B005PPMHO2", "B00GTZWZH6", "B000RBA6CO", "B0009JE6G6", "B0048FUUAI", "B0028ERCMU", "B0081QF6Q8", "B003BNO9GO", "B000GLKNRI", "B004X60QWO", "B00062IDCO", "B0030VANJO", "B002BAW6FY", "B007XF0XVQ", "B00F3L8P26", "B000FP2OPY", "B001D2WUGG", "B00402FGE4", "B0057FGD3Q", "B0000CABIJ", "B003BV8I7C", "B002VA59ZS", "B000SO7PBU", "B00E8OMZGG", "B002VA5A02", "B00188XHFI", "B001DMVZOE", "B008R52LA2", "B002PXJRR2", "B004X60QE2", "B004TJ1H3C", "B000CEXFYW", "B0002WZTCA"], "bought_together": ["B001HUWQEA", "B00129W6LE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0036EH3UC", "B000AJJNFE", "B00129W6LE", "B00A3717C0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 29107}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.69, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B000BNI90Y", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51IfCLLm3jL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Battlestar Galactica - Season 2.0 (Episodes 1-10)"}

{"description": "From producer John Carpenter comes the all-new retelling of his terror classic, THE FOG.  Tom Welling (TV's \"Smallville\"), Maggie Grace (TV's \"Lost\") and Selma Blair (Hellboy) star in this senses-shattering tale of demonic retribution, directed by Rupert Wainwright (Stigmata) and written by Cooper Layne.  Trapped within an eerie mist, the residents of Antonio Bay have become the unwitting victims of a horrifying vengeance.  One hundred years ago, a ship carrying lepers was purposely lured onto the rocky coastline and sunk, drowning all aboard.

{"description": "Kate & Allie: Season Oneintroduced a new type of nuclear family to the 1980s: a pair of divorced women living with their children together in a somewhat cramped New York brownstone. A mid-season replacement in 1984, the sitcom starring Susan Saint James as Kate McArdle and Jane Curtain as Allie Lowell was both a critical and commercial success. The shoulder pads, clunky answering machine, and hairdon'ts give away the decade, but the storylines of grown-up best friends supporting and, at times, sparring with each other during personal and professional crises are timeless. Curtain and Saint James share a wonderful chemistry that makes them easy to watch.In the first of six episodes, viewers are introduced to Allie's first post-divorce date, played by a dashing young Kelsey Grammer (Cheers,Frasier). Almost two decades before the gals onSex and the Citybegan tackling relationships, Kate summed it up best: \"Dating's about finding someone so you never have to date again.\" By the time the series ended production in 1989, Kate and Allie's relationship had gotten a little hackneyed and it was time for the ladies to move on. But those first few seasons were fast, funny, and full of possibilities.--Jae-Ha Kim", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006N2EZA", "B000CELOW2", "B004DOTKCS", "B00008EYBH", "B000EQ45BU", "B00005JNIS", "B0000DFZ5O", "B0001Z3I1C", "B001LRL4WY", "B000EU1QC2", "B000CELOVI", "B000OVLBH6", "B000K7UBXE", "B00GLPYVQC", "B00JDCP0QA", "B003476UIW", "B0089BSLKS", "B000HIVIOC", "B001P9N9B2", "B000YKYT1M", "B001NPK5BU", "B001GP5TMW", "B000Q6GUJS", "B00005JLIB", "B000R7I3YG", "B002E58FTW", "B00GOC75YW", "B0006N2EZK", "B000F8O2MO", "B000GW8UAE", "B00A2XQTVY", "B00BUWD7NE", "B00005JNHU", "B00465I1D8", "B00GHH9HW2", "B00I2YXN5A", "B0017VG690", "B00008EY6N", "B0025KVNOU", "B000RGULLA", "B00GOC74QG", "B0001IN0T4", "B0002NY8R6", "B00A2XQU7M", "B008X8U83K", "B009TTGLJ2", "B00096S45S", "B00DJYK1XU", "B00A2XQTF0", "B000C6NPHC", "B0058EE6NK", "B000NDEXO8", "B00GHH9HUE", "B000291Q3O", "B000FGFBR6", "B00HRUQA6O", "B000ZBEOHY", "B00005JO3P", "B0002JZT5U", "B00HZMZ286", "B00005JOJR", "B00007GZRS", "B0002DB5N6", "B007JNZYPM", "B000FJAAHY", "B000MGBLFK", "B007RMQ4HW", "B00005JO4F", "B004VK759Y", "B000I2J6VE", "B000MGTQ6G", "B000A0GXGK", "B000Y7U9AK", "B000NTMA1U", "B00G3BRC24", "B000BGR1B4", "B000VWQU88", "B003QTDH8E", "B005TTEG5W", "B008H6GHII", "B004NJC0IO", "B000EU1QBS", "B000OHZKYU", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B000M2E2AU", "B00CVB6XDO", "B0006IUDXA", "B000QUEQ68", "B004MWLXTY", "B00005JOXR", "B00EYA6VF0", "B004B93RHY", "B0009B16TY", "B000SQFC0O", "B004GJYR82", "B002WQ79A4", "B0039UU3EQ", "B00008J2EB", "B004HHX9PK", "B0030ATZH6"], "bought_together": ["B0006N2EZA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FGFBR6", "B003476UIW", "B004DOTKCS", "B000B5XOUM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 105211}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 6.49, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

{"description": "The Time Tunnelrivaled Mr. Peabody for improbable history, and in the series' final 15 episodes, scientists Tony Newman (James Darrin) and Doug Phillips' (Robert Colbert) time travels take an increasingly fantastic turn, as witness their close encounters with aliens in \"Visitors from Beyond the Stars,\" \"The Kidnappers,\" \"Raiders from Outer Space,\" and the final episode, \"Town of Terror\" (listen in these episodes for the music that shamelessly steals from Bernard Herrmann's score forThe Day the Earth Stood Still). Things even take a supernatural turn in \"The Ghost of Nero.\" Tony and Doug's excellent adventures include meetings with such personages as Rudyard Kipling (\"Night of the Long Knives\"), \"Billy the Kid,\" and, incredibly, Machiavelli, who has been transported to Gettysburg during the Civil War (\"The Death Merchant\"). They also meet up with such mythical characters as Robin Hood (\"The Revenge of Robin Hood\") and \"Merlin the Magician.\"  One of the series' more provocative episodes is \"The Walls of Jericho,\" in which Tony and Doug join forces with Joshua. Observing from Project Tic-Toc's underground facility, Dr. Ann MacGregor (Lee Meriwether) expresses skepticism over the biblical story. \"I'm a scientist,\" she states. \"I don't permit myself to believe in miracles.\" Other memorable episodes include \"Kill Two by Two,\" set on a Pacific Island during 1945 where Tony and Doug meet a disgraced Japanese soldier, and the episode featuring Robert Duvall as a saboteur who leads Tony and Doug on a \"Chase Through Time.\"Among this series' enduring charms are the obvious use of footage from theatrical films to clumsily boost production values, as well as some of the more juvenile dialogue. When they learn of one alien plot to attack earth, our heroes proclaim, \"We can't let them do it.\" Time ran out on theTunnelafter only one season. Its cancellation left Tony and Doug to seemingly forever tumble \"along the infinite corridors of time\" en route to some \"new fantastic adventure.\" Thanks to DVD, we can join them time after time.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BOH8Z0", "B001HUHBBS", "B000BZISS0", "B000GUJZ0U", "B000FFJ87Q", "B000K7VHYG", "B001MT7ZJC", "B000TLTCTK", "B0044XV7AQ", "B0006UEVTA", "B0014BQR3I", "B0002IQKAY", "B00096S47G", "B0002XVQNK", "B001HUHBB8", "B0000DC3VM", "B000P5FH2Q", "B00144P9RA", "B001CQONOA", "B0012Z36EO", "B00E5G03I4", "B006TBYC76", "B00KTZALDC", "B001DXS4DI", "B00BUDDMGU", "B000PFUAN2", "B0002CX1M0", "B000ATQYWY", "B00005JM5Z", "B00G5N6C8U", "B0007CEXUY", "B00IF0KAYS", "B00D9EJFZA", "B008LC8RQ8", "B001PR2186", "B001B0H7DG", "B00JK47BHM", "B00GX7D5G0", "B00105307O", "B0000AZKJ8", "B000LE16Y4", "B002VA5A02", "B00EEEHL9G", "B000V3JGIS", "B00KYCA4QY", "B005DKS1Z8", "B000ERVJKO", "B00E96AY20", "B008HSK3PE", "B00IYJFB2G", "B00CPR3RB0", "B000HEWEJ4", "B000N6UF10", "B001DZOCZU", "B00DXLO0D6", "B0009JE6G6", "B000UX6TKC", "B0050MB5AC", "B00JEZWRE4", "B004PQM81E", "B002L9N4E2", "B00HMOWA0A", "B003J216K4", "B000HWZ4HU", "B007ZR9H64", "B0016MOWNM", "B000KLQUT4", "B0012Z36FI", "B00IXPWGIS", "B001BN4WI6", "B000O78KY2", "B000RZIGTA", "B00CPTUMY8", "B00IO998U2", "B000O78KWE", "B00E9ZAU02", "B001DHXT6G", "B009OE2ODY", "B00I208ZHA", "B000LV6W00", "B000CSTKGA", "B0018BDDH2", "B000HWZ4GQ", "B00079HZS4", "B000UX6TJI", "B005DGKBDC", "B0045HCJSA", "B0062KMDWU", "B001E0O8DA", "B005JJCMNU", "B000HWZ4E8", "B000NOIX66", "B00769U98Q", "B001B23ED6", "B00C10EG7A", "B0002NY81C", "B0012EBV88", "B0002J4ZX2", "B000W4KT9G", "B00B00HUC0"], "bought_together": ["B000BOH8Z0", "B001HUHBBS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BOH8Z0", "B001CQONOA", "B001HUHBBS", "B000LE16Y4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 26154}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 20.5, "brand": "20TH Century Fox", "asin": "B000EXDS2A", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DK3BG3GZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Time Tunnel - Volume Two"}
{"description": "Arrested Development--one of the greatest comedies in the history of television--went out in a blaze of glory. The truncated final season packed more biting humor per minute than ever before. In only 13 episodes, dozens of intertwining storylines spun in all directions: In addition to the overarching story about the fractious infighting of the Bluth family and the family's housing development company being investigated for treason in Iraq (a plot arc that comes to a dazzlingly surreal conclusion), the put-upon \"good son\" Michael Bluth (Jason Bateman,Teen Wolf Too) pursues romance with a lovely British woman (Charlize Theron,Monster) who turns out to be woefully inappropriate; swaggering magician Gob (Will Arnett,Monster-In-Law) flees from his newly-discovered teenage son while still pandering for the affection of his self-absorbed father (Jeffrey Tambor,The Larry Sanders Show); flighty Lindsay (Portia de Rossi,Ally McBeal) and her sexually blurry husband Tobias (David Cross,Mr. Show) both get the hots for the family's new lawyer, Bob Loblaw (Scott Baio,Charles in Charge); and much, much more. It's difficult to describe what makesArrested Developmentso brilliant. The ensemble is uniformly superb (Jessica Walter, as the family's boozing, scheming matriarch, is particularly devastating this season) and the surprising guest stars (including Andy Richter, James Lipton, Justine Bateman, and many others) are perfectly cast; the characters' abominable behavior defies conventional television notions of \"likability\", yet they only grow more endearing the more you watch; the humor embraces wild slapstick and sharp satire, often within a single scene; and the nimble documentary style allows for sly glancing references to jokes and scenes from long-past episodes, rewarding devoted fans. But the key is that, no matter how screwballArrested Developmentbecomes, the show offers a rich, textured, and wonderfully coherent world in which these characters feel genuine, a world completely unlike the flat, plastic simulacrum offered by the average sitcom.Arrested Developmentwas true to itself to the end. Its followers will cherish it forever.--Bret FetzerStills from The Third Season ofArrested Development(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000A9QKRI", "B0002PYS7Y", "B00ICR6SBI", "B000RBA6CO", "B0024FAD9M", "B001B9LWME", "B000RW3VDE", "B002DPPH6W", "B0018RKEQE", "B002N5N5KW", "B001L1S1PS", "B0053O8ACS", "B000FFJYE8", "B0002W4P98", "B003L77GE2", "B000SINT4S", "B009LDD40U", "B002N5N5PM", "B00GSW3EQG", "B000GETTKM", "B00008YGRS", "B001YYQA0K", "B0024FAD9W", "B002N5N5SO", "B00005JNEQ", "B00BI7ZAM2", "B000AJJNI6", "B0009VBTP0", "B0008JIJ1A", "B00AQ7EJ04", "B003L77GBU", "B000DZ7YN8", "B003R4ZMOA", "B003L77GDS", "B009LDCVJU", "B0058JEHTS", "B00166UFSY", "B001AEF6AY", "B000QXDJLI", "B007CO5MVE", "B003UD7JDA", "B001NOMOS8", "B0012CJQY6", "B009TE9GNK", "B002EOVX9W", "B001VPJYZ0", "B007QU37LG", "B008L0YMZA", "B00123BY6S", "B001DJLCRC", "B000NNK4DM", "B005S97V82", "B003L77GTC", "B0012CJQYG", "B0000V45YG", "B003L77GJM", "B0001I9Y8U", "B00007E8V4", "B0058YPG1G", "B002N5N5NE", "B001DPHDBU", "B000EMI6LE", "B0012CJQYQ", "B000TGURZ8", "B000Q6GUKW", "B000E6ES9O", "B00008YGRV", "B00AB65SVE", "B004YM6JSW", "B0053O8A8M", "B007ZFR67I", "B000ENUYGI", "B0032UYFA6", "B00008PHCU", "B007C8RZQ0", "B000EBGFPY", "B001RTSPVY", "B005OZIV20", "B007W58N6O", "B0007RO8MW", "B00475B0G2", "B000U1ZV1W", "B000083C6V", "B002AMVED8", "B000LC3IKG", "B000S76LKI", "B00A2XQU7M", "B0058EE6OO", "B00BTRKMNI", "B002N5N5LG", "B007KFZ7YM", "B00BT1XCOU", "B00166647K", "B001OQCVFG", "B000FL7CAU", "B0013FSL16", "B000GPIPTM", "B0053O8A78", "B0060MYKYY", "B002OOWKSU"], "bought_together": ["B000A9QKRI", "B0002PYS7Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002PYS7Y", "B000A9QKRI", "B00ICR6SBI", "B00EPH8S58"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22585}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 12.54, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B000EXDS7K", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F7EES6SHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Arrested Development: Season 3"}
{"description": "\"I just want to play well, share the stage with my friends, give the best I can,\" says Neil Young before the concert that is the centerpiece ofHeart of Gold. No problem, dude. Working with filmmaker Jonathan Demme, Young has come up with a gem--not all flash and bling-bling, but as understated as a single pearl, musically restrained yet emotionally open. Of course, neither Demme (an Oscar winner forThe Silence of the Lambs; he also helmed Talking Heads'Stop Making Sense) nor Young would call it \"a concert film\"; the director describes it as \"a dream concert, something that's literally being dreamt by Neil,\" while the singer-songwriter himself calls it \"a multi-level story.\" Whatever, the project came together in 2005, as Young was finishing hisPrairie Windalbum (the latest in a string of lovely, country-flavored acoustic recordings dating back to 1972'sHarvest) and preparing to debut the music at Nashville's fabled Ryman Auditorium, home of the Grand Ole Opry. The fact that Young had also recently experienced a brain aneurysm might or might not have influenced his decision to film the show, but it certainly seems to have had an effect on the music. He and his band (which, with the addition of horns, strings, and backup singers, including Emmylou Harris, occasionally numbers forty or more musicians) performPrairie Windin its entirety, and there is some deeply moving, highly personal material here; in addition to the gospel-tinged \"When God Made Me\" and the dirge-like \"No Wonder,\" Young sings about his recently-deceased father (the title song), his newly adult daughter (\"Here for You\"), the guitar he plays that once belonged to Hank Williams (\"This Old Guitar\"), and even his dog (\"He Was the King\"). Demme's direction is ideal for conveying the music's restrained acoustic textures, rich backing vocals, and simple, elegant melodies. Shots are held much longer than is usual in such films, and while there are lots of close-ups, there are no gimmicks. This superb DVD package is filled out by a second disc of bonus features, including a variety of featurettes and a solo performance of \"The Needle and the Damage Done\" fromThe Johnny Cash Showin 1971.--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B008OHV5QO", "B008OHV4PG", "B000AXSN5G", "B000MTPANQ", "B00006H33G", "B000053U0B", "B000002KCV", "B00G34XP3Q", "6305837996", "B00JROMHM4", "B000002MG4", "B00HQI7VMY", "B000A0GP4K", "B00023B1A8", "B001VZY4LY", "B00006SFLX", "B000002KCS", "B000I5YDBE", "B00HQI823Q", "B004VK74P4", "B00063EMJ6", "B000002KDG", "B004VK74UE", "B000FGG738", "B0007GADYU", "6304498969", "B000W1V5TM", "B00092ZMDY", "B000002LQM", "B000002MKM", "B001VZY4MI", "630463949X", "B00003CXB1", "B001VZY4M8", "B000002KCC", "B000641ZYA", "B00005R23S", "B00979CS50", "B00068C7VQ", "B000SSV8HI", "B000023X9W", "B000002LHM", "B000EZ7ZZ4", "B0001MDQ6W", "B00009P1NY", "B00KF1CWF0", "B000MTPANG", "0142180319", "B0014DZ2XC", "1573300934", "B0000A02WW", "B005N959PE", "B000002KCI", "1573306983", "B000002KCN", "B000002KDI", "B000KJU1HI", "B0011MMUJU", "B001V732VU", "B000002MUC", "B000FBHCBY", "B00004VW35", "B00064VR0W", "B00KIZ9F8K", "B003W5C0VM", "6305610460", "B000AYQJ3I", "B000JFXTM2", "B00HUQC442", "B003PBYT62", "B0001ENXYA", "B00005V1WV", "B003XMKMZU", "1847326943", "B00K0HDE7Y", "B001XJEKGC", "140279911X", "B000083C7Z", "B00008PX8P", "B007PK9NAG", "B00005NVHA", "B0000TGADW", "B001FWRZ0U", "B0000DG7C0", "B0001MDQ44", "B004J88SGC", "B00002ND7R", "B0002IQI2Y", "B0000584ZV", "B004B3BIG2", "B00JOWHT2C", "B005V4X8UO", "B00IXKTMFS", "B00066VURU", "B000002ITW", "B000BTC5LW", "B000BF0DCE", "B00IBQ5NIO", "B00009P1O0"], "bought_together": ["B008OHV5QO", "B00G34XP3Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DW5ILQ0", "B008OHV5QO", "B00063EMJ6", "B000MTPANQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 16384}, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Singer-Songwriters"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Vocal Pop"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 13.99, "brand": "DEMME,JONATHAN", "asin": "B000F48D00", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518F3MNVWHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Neil Young - Heart of Gold"}

{"description": "Based on cartoonist Aaron McGruder's politically charged daily comic strip,The Boondocksbrings no-holds-barred social commentary and comedy to the Cartoon Network's Adult Swim programming, and now, all 15 episodes of the 2005-2006 debut season are available in an uncut and uncensored format in this three-disc set. As with McGruder's strip, the animated version ofThe Boondocksuses a fish-out-of-water format--10-year-old revolutionary-in-training Huey Freeman (voiced by Regina King), his 8-year-old brother Riley (also King), and their salty Granddad (John Witherspoon) relocate to an upscale suburban neighborhood--to take aim at all manner of cultural issues in both the black and white communities. Targets sighted in these episodes include singer R. Kelly's bedroom shenanigans (\"The Trial of R. Kelly\"); gangsta rap (\"The Story of Gangstalicious,\" which includes a wicked spoof of the documentaryTupac: Resurrection); Oprah Winfrey (who is almost kidnapped by Riley in \"Let's Nab Oprah\"); and Martin Luther King, who revives from a coma to be branded a terrorist in \"Return of the King,\" which generated plenty of heat from the Rev. Al Sharpton upon its broadcast. All of the above topics are handled in a decidedly less-than-respectful and occasionally offensive manner, though exactly who will findThe Boondocksscandalous and who will find its approach fearless and on the money will depend on the viewer. But there's no arguing that the show is frequently as funny as McGruder's comic.

{"description": "Shinichiro Watanabe'sfilm noir-ish sci-fi adventureCowboy Bebopset a new standard for cool in anime in 1998, andSamurai Champloo, an edgy mix of Edo-era martial arts and hip-hop irreverence, is a worthy follow-up. A string of coincidences brings together three misfits in a two-bit tea house: Mugen, a rebellious vagabond; Jin, a taciturn ronin; and Fuu, a nutty waitress. The sardonic Mugen lacks the polish that distinguishes a classic martial artist--he uses break dance spins and flips against his foes. Jin moves with a polish that approaches iciness: When he unsheathes his sword, he becomes a lethal work of art in motion. Fuu forces Jin and Mugen to help her find a mysterious samurai \"who smells of sun flowers.\" As the ill-assorted trio wanders towards Nagasaki, Watanabe treats the audiences to a string of&#xA0;outrageous, anachronistic adventures. In Episode 18, Mugen belatedly learns to read at a smackdown elementary school, while Jin tries to settle the rivalry between the heirs to the dojo of his former sensei. The seemingly unrelated storylines collide in a no-holds-barred graffiti contest featuring Tokugawa rap lyrics, ink-brush tagging, Hiroshima homeboys, and a caricature of Andy Warhol.  But Watanabe reveals the hidden significance of these nutty interludes when he brings his picaresque adventure-comedy to a close. LikeCowboy Bebop,Samurai Champlooleaves the viewer wanting more.

{"description": "The overall strength of the second season ofHouse, M.D.proves that its first-year success wasn't a fluke. This season starts with Dr. House (Golden Globe winner Hugh Laurie) pursuing his ex-wife Stacy (Sela Ward) and ending with a tragedy that could potentially be deadly for himself and two colleagues. The premise of each show follows a set routine--a patient is brought in with unusual symptoms; House challenges his trio of underlings to diagnose the problem; they treat the patient, usually incorrectly the first few tries; and then at the very last minute--through a revelation that often has little to do with the patient--House figures out what's wrong and saves the day. It would be easy for this set up to grow old fast. But because of the smart writing, nuanced acting, and believability of the characters (who're often dealing with unbelievable scenarios), the formula works on each of the 24 episodes that aired on Fox during the 2005-2006 season. Viewers have been conditioned by the Marcus Welbys of the TV world to think of doctors as saviors. Even onER, the most narcissistic physician was selfless at heart. But House is a different breed. When he's at an off-track betting parlor and a woman collapses, he doesn't miss a beat. Still eying his race on television, he asks, \"Is anybody here a doctor?\" He'll mock a sick patient's complaints with a sarcastic, \"Boo hoo!\"  And, if there happens to be a dead body around, he has no qualms about shooting it if he believes that could help diagnose another gun-shot victim.Not that he's any more reasonable or compassionate to his boss Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein), his oncologist best friend Wilson (Tony winner Robert Sean Leonard), or his young charges Foreman (Omar Epps), Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), and Chase (Jesse Spencer). He instructs his doctors to break into patients' homes as if they're cat burglars. He does not know the meaning of the phrase \"politically correct.\" But because he spits out insults (as if he has a mild case of Tourette's) equally to both his patients and colleagues, the latter never flinch at his constant stream of inappropriateness. When his three young doctors storm into his office to report the declining condition of a patient by blurting out, \"We have rectal bleeding,\" House says, \"What? All three of you?\" To sensitive Wilson, who is trying to get some work done without being interrupted, House says, \"I know you're in there. I can hear you caring.\" And when Foreman's father says, \"My son says you're a manipulative bastard,\" House replies, \"It's a pet name. I call him Dr. Bling.\" Of course House actually does care about his patients, but he views a good bedside manner as the luxury of a doctor who has a healthy patient. But dying patients with seemingly incurable diseases need something more. They need House.--Jae-Ha Kim", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000R9YLKY", "B001QE99AQ", "B001A4VH2U", "B0024FAD8I", "B002JVWR7M", "B003R0MF3A", "B0053O89JM", "B003R0MF3K", "B002JVWR7W", "B0053O89K6", "B000AJJNI6", "1550229559", "B000EBGFPY", "B00005JNEQ", "B00008972G", "B00005JO9J", "B000HT3P60", "B0018CWEY4", "B000RO6JYK", "B000FIMG5Y", "B00064VQXA", "B000GPIPTM", "B0009IW88K", "B0037XPPAM", "B003L77H1Y", "B0001O3YLM", "B001B7CNZ6", "0470316608", "B0081QF6Q8", "B0015RRNMA", "B0001906X6", "B000NOKFH6", "B009LDD4V4", "B001DPHDBU", "B001L1S1OY", "B0024FAR6Q", "B000QDLSR0", "B000FKO3GW", "B001C4CI8U", "B001992NWO", "B0053O89IS", "B003YLM78U", "B000P6YNSO", "B0000A2ZNL", "B0002NY8GW", "B000KGH00W", "B0000AVHCA", "B00079FUI6", "B000F8O2OW", "B000U1ZV1W", "B0019CSXAM", "B000H7JCE6", "B0058EE6OO", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B00I099JYQ", "B004STBF2G", "B0077PTWY6", "B002BWP2BW", "B001VPJYZ0", "B00008AOX3", "B000F8O2Q0", "B00020H9NO", "B000NDEXK2", "B002JVWR4A", "B000F8O2OM", "B00AQ5RRJQ", "B000LC4ZI0", "B002WC89WK", "B0002DB5N6", "B003L77G8I", "B002N5N5MK", "B001G0MFL0", "B002N5N4NA", "B002ZCY80O", "B00005JLFT", "B00005JNOG", "B000B8I9ZO", "B0053O8A46", "B00062IDEW", "B004HI79JQ", "B000SQFC40", "B0051QS1P4", "B0058YPILY", "B001934SNM", "B00B04NIOU", "B001BL6QDW", "B00070HK4C", "B000A7DW7Q", "B001AI776G", "B000B8IA08", "B001UHN88I", "B000SO7PCE", "B000OIOOVE", "B001MVWRMU", "B002JVWRD6", "B004QXJZXK", "B00008NV4G", "B0024FAD9C", "B005SZED64", "B000B5XOVQ"], "bought_together": ["B000R9YLKY", "B001QE99AQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001QE99AQ", "B002JVWR7M", "B003R0MF3A", "B001A4VH2U"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8925}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 16.99, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

{"description": "From Buenos Aires with dread comesEpitafios, a devastating, gag-inducing, and gut-wrenching 13-part miniseries, produced by HBO for Latin America, but was such a sensation it earned a subtitled American broadcast and DVD release. Those creepily compelled bySe7en, or who breathlessly awaited the unmasking of the Carver onNip/Tuckwill be hooked intoEpitafosfrom first corpse to last (the body count is substantial). Things get off to a shocking start with the discovery of the gruesomely dismembered body of a former professor, who five years earlier had taken hostage four students, all of whom died when a rescue attempt went horribly awry. Now, someone is methodically killing those who had a direct and indirect connection with the tragedy. Reluctantly pulled back on to the case is psyche-scarred Renzo (Julio Chavez), the suicidal and self-pitying former cop who blames himself for the students' deaths. He quit the force and is now a cab driver. His old friend on the force, the grizzled Benitez (Lito Cruz), recruits him to help when two tombstones bearing their names are found at the crime scene. Sharing Renzo's tombstone is the name of beautiful psychologist  Laura Santini (Paolo Krum), who was treating the professor when he flipped out, and with whom Renzo, her patient,  had fallen in love.It gets creepier. Much creepier.  In advance of each murder, the killer sends the police fiendishly enigmatic tombstone epitaphs (hence the title), among them: \"Here lies he who never should have trusted his best friend\" and \"Here lies he who turned deception into a game.\"  He also seems to be everywhere and to be able to anticipate his pursuers' every move. He leaves an ominous message for Laura on her child's balloon before she picks him up at school. He ignites the outlines of body drawings on the street where one of his victims will be passing. The despair inEpitafiosis palpable. It makesSe7enlook like the feel-good movie of the century. It also thinks nothing of pulling the rug out from under viewers expecting major characters to survive the miniseries, or introducing others, such as homicide investigator Marina (Ceclia Roth), with very heavy emotional baggage of their own.

{"description": "A fast-paced romantic comedy,S&#xF3;lo con tu parejawas director Alfonso Cuar&#xF3;n's ticket to a bright and promising future. Inspired by the classic screwball comedies of Ernst Lubitsch, this social satire (the title translates as \"Only with Your Partner\") was Cuar&#xF3;n's feature debut, but because it was a state-funded film that poked fun at Mexican culture, it was initially withheld from release by the Mexican government, only to become a critical and popular success when it was finally released in Mexico in 1991. (It wasn't released in the U.S. until 2006.) A remarkably polished debut, it offered ample proof that Cuar&#xF3;n was a talent to watch, as proven by the films Cuar&#xF3;n would later direct both in and out of Hollywood, includingA Little Princess(1995),Great Expectations(1998),Y tu mam&#xE1; tambi&#xE9;n(2001),Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban(2004), and the near-future thrillerChildren of Men(2006). The talent behind those later films is fully evident here, and from a lively script by his brother Carlos, Cuar&#xF3;n concocts a frothy farce about a reckless playboy named Tom&#xE1;s (Daniel Gim&#xE9;nez Cacho, from Almodovar'sBad Education) whose bed-hopping catches up with him when his latest conquest, a sexy nurse, falsely checks the \"positive\" box on his latest AIDS test to curtail Tom&#xE1;s's rampant womanizing.Now wait a minute... this is a comedy with AIDS humor, from 1991? This was certainly a bold move from the Cuar&#xF3;n brothers, but the humor is handled with graceful style, and as Tom&#xE1;s grows affectionately obsessed with a gorgeous neighbor in his Mexico City apartment building, his once-thriving love life grows increasingly (and comedically) complicated. The casting is flawless, the slapstick humor is impeccably timed, and the film is technically blessed by the brilliant cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki, who supervised this high-definition digital transfer to DVD, and who followed Cuar&#xF3;n on a mutual path to international acclaim. Thematically enriched by Mozart'sDon Giovanni(heard throughout the soundtrack),S&#xF3;lo con tu parejacan now be appreciated as a well-crafted launching pad for one of the most consistently impressive filmmakers of the early 21st century.--Jeff ShannonOn the DVDThe Criterion Collection supplements forS&#xF3;lo con tu parejaare nearly as enjoyable as the film itself. \"MakingS&#xF3;lo con tu pareja\" is a 30-minute documentary (2006) featuring in-depth interviews with Alfonso and Carlos Cuar&#xF3;n and lead actor Daniel Gim&#xE9;nez Cacho. Also included isCuarteto para el fin del tiempo, a short written and directed by Alfonso Cuar&#xF3;n when he was a film student in 1983; another short film,Noche de bodas(\"Wedding Night\"), written and directed for Mexican television by Carlos Cuar&#xF3;n in 2000; and the original theatrical trailer forS&#xF3;lo con tu pareja. In the accompanying 28-page booklet, an essay by scholar Ryan F. Long examines the film from the perspective of Mexican culture and politics, and Carlos Cuar&#xF3;n contributes a detailed character history of Tom&#xE1;s that was written so Daniel Gim&#xE9;nez Cacho could thoroughly understand the character he was playing. (Other character profiles are available on the Criterion Collection Web site.) It's a fascinating piece of background history, demonstrating the care and detail that went into the creation of this highly enjoyable comedy.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BOH904", "B00005JL57", "6304698623", "B00HE011DE", "B00HE010QM", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B00IGK6T9W", "B00HVOFP6W", "B001YV502C", "B004MOJW0E", "B00GPPXNLC", "B0012Z362Q", "B00JPUUSEE", "B00GPPXNEE", "B00GPPXP6A", "B00J2PQZRQ", "B005HK13OK", "B00IGK6TGU", "B00HE00ZIQ", "B00005JLQW", "B00GBT637S", "B009VO9XSG", "B00H9L28OO", "B00I4X8KU2", "B00HE01030", "B00HVOFP12", "B00E1S1MMM", "B00HRISNPM", "B001EOQCL2", "B00371QQ8Y", "B009GIGY3E", "B00F98FOI6", "B00HVOFP9O", "B001CW7ZSA", "B001WLMOG4", "B002VECLXC", "B00HVOFP08", "B00JPUUSSU", "B000VARC32", "B00005NC66", "B008S2NABI", "B00007CVS3", "B006OB3K56", "B000QXDFR6", "B000E1OI80", "B003KGBISE", "B00HE010LC", "B007A4Y1Q8", "B007UW9W32", "B00AX7PGQS", "B000EZ9084", "B00DZP1BY6", "B00H9HZITU", "B000C8Q900", "B0026VBOJW", "B000N6TX1I", "1559409053", "B00IGK6TLA", "B000BR6QIW", "B0026VBOJ2", "B00005N7Z1", "B000MTEFPK", "B009RWRIP2", "B002H0LCGM", "B00005A8TU", "B000Q6ZG5C", "B004OOL73W", "B002M2T1V8", "B000XPSC0W", "B00L3ZB3Y8", "B0029O0BK4", "B003KGBIS4", "B005HK13SG", "B0057GYODG", "B0007WFYC0", "B00005UQ7Q", "B004CIIXDM", "B00393SFU2", "B00005N8A9", "B0035G5IOE", "0780023536", "B008Y5OWKW", "B004NWPY34", "B0007OCG60", "B008CB8CJK", "B004JOBATI", "B00009W0U4", "B00005JM80", "B00A8QDIMS", "B001CW7ZSU", "B0043VUHV4", "B00005JLHW", "B00AQ6J5JU", "B0012Z363A", "0783228457", "B00007ELDG", "B001UV4XC4", "B00AEFYVUQ", "B000069CF9", "B0083V2W4U"], "bought_together": ["6304698623"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JL57", "B0002TT0MI", "6304698623", "B000N6TX1I"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 206329}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.6, "brand": "Image Entertainment", "asin": "B000H5U5R6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5132WQVMRSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Solo Con Tu Pareja (The Criterion Collection)"}
{"description": "Through its simplicity and scrupulous attention to historical detail,Sophie Scholl: The Final Daysproves to be both thrillingly suspenseful and emotionally devastating. During the peak of the Third Reich, Sophie Scholl (Julia Jentsch,The Edukators), along with her brother Hans and other students in Munich, formed a resistance group called the White Rose and distributed anti-Nazi leaflets.Sophie Schollbegins on a crisp winter day, with Sophie and Hans distributing leaflets around the empty halls of a university before class is let out.  The tension only increases as they are arrested, interrogated, and swiftly convicted in a brutal show trial. The heart of the film are the scenes between Sophie and her interrogator, Robert Mohr (Gerald Alexander Held), a loyal Nazi who nonetheless respected and perhaps even admired Sophie.  Their arguments, distilled down from hours of historical record, crackle with emotion and resonate throughout history, from Communist totalitarianism to the Bush administration condemning critics of the Iraq war as traitors. Jentsch's restrained performance only grows more and more moving over the movie's course.

{"description": "Impressive in qualityandquantity, the 27 episodes ofBoston Legal's second season (2005-06) are a dazzling showcase for one of TV's greatest ensembles. Everything that madeseason 1so entertaining is refined here, often to the point of perfection: As the resident bad boys of the prestigious Boston legal firm of Crane, Poole & Schmidt, senior partner Denny Crane (William Shatner) and maverick attorney Alan Shore (James Spader) continue their campaign of rampant indiscretion, combining unabashed sexism and political incorrectness with Denny's egotistical fat-cat sense of entitlement (and a touch of \"Mad Cow\") and Alan's passion for justice and courtroom theatrics. The departure of his girlfriend Tara (season 1's Rhona Mitra) has left Alan pensively lonely, so his male-bonding with Denny becomes the series' emotional core, even as it reaches new heights of hilarity in episodes like \"Finding Nimmo,\" an instant classic in which Denny introduces Alan to the pleasures of fly-fishing. Back at the office, semi-regular cast member Betty White turns from murder to robbery, only to find herself redeemed as the new \"sandwich lady\" at C, P & S. And while senior partner Paul Lewiston (Rene Auberjonois) juggles the firm's ethical dilemmas and a rocky reunion with his drug-addicted daughter (superbly played by Jayne Brook), founding partner Shirley Schmidt (Candice Bergen) dodges advances from her soon-to-be-remarried ex-husband (Tom Selleck) while suspecting Denny's soon-to-be-sixth-wife (Joanna Cassidy) of high-stakes gold-digging. In the midst of it all, Denise (Julie Bowen) faces threatening competition from a new attorney (Parker Posey) and elusive love with a dying billionaire (Michael J. Fox) while playing \"friends with benefits\" with colleague Brad (Mark Valley), who's only too willing to indulge their arrangement.Expanded roles for Bowen and Valley are just two of this season's welcome improvements; along with Bergen and Auberjonois, they add engaging counterbalance to the Spader/Shatner juggernaut, while newcomers Justin Mentell and Ryan Michelle Bathe (as legal assistants) add youthful appeal in roles that necessarily remained marginal for most of the season. As always, series creator David E. Kelley (aided by a new writing staff) maintains a constant flow of outrageous behavior (most of it Denny's) and compelling courtroom trials based on hot-button issues including assisted suicide, the war in Iraq, private school discrimination, medical malpractice, tax evasion and a variety of other cases in which belligerent judges (played by Henry Gibson, Anthony Heald, Howard Hesseman, Shelley Berman, and others) play antagonistic foils to Alan Shore's impassioned defense. (It's here where Spader excels; Shore may be a lascivious lothario, but you offend his moral conscience at your peril.) A stellar array of guest stars, impeccable editing and cinematography, and glossy office production design makeBoston Legala constant feast for the eyes and ears, with breezy emphasis on the farcical goings-on at Crane, Poole & Schmidt. (The series' writing and production values are explored in brief but enjoyable bonus featurettes included on the final DVD in this seven-disc set.)With Denny and Alan's season-ending visit to Los Angeles (where they defend a sexy celebrity played byStar Trek: Voyager's Jeri Ryan), it's delightfully obvious that Shatner and Spader are the heart and soul ofBoston Legal, which is ultimately about the mutual affection of two men whose viewpoints are often as polarized as their friendship is compassionately co-dependent. Bolstered by clever allusions to Shatner'sStar Treklegacy and throwaway references to their own status as characters in a TV show (as Kelley and his writers deliberately demolish the \"fourth wall\" of TV for comedic effect), Spader and Shatner quickly turned their episode-closing balcony scenes into an honorable tradition, where differences dissolve in the taste of fine scotch and slowly-savored cigars. They're bringing us the finest \"dramedy\" that primetime network television has to offer, and we'll gladly follow them as their crazy lives continue.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000RO6JZE", "B000EHSVBE", "B001B18716", "B001SMC9IU", "B00HNGC516", "B000O77SOK", "B00369ERC4", "B000TGURZ8", "B003INBNV6", "B002KQ6UE2", "B0006IIPLM", "B00003CXND", "0767812158", "B0006FFRR0", "B0000WN1N6", "B0002DRDY6", "B00GHH9HUE", "B00188XHF8", "B00DMI56CY", "B00HRUQA6O", "B00005JLF3", "6305922675", "B00FZ2NTOM", "B0002WZN9Y", "B000AQ68U0", "B000TM1CL0", "B0031MA8P6", "B0001VTPUE", "B000GPPNO2", "B0006N2EZA", "B0006GAO36", "B000K7VHJ6", "B000A2X4BK", "B000RF7XZ8", "B002JVWRD6", "B001BN4WK4", "B001AQT158", "B000HC2LHQ", "B001ASIHZG", "B00005JLFT", "B001G0MFQ0", "B006WK4Y6I", "B006WK4Y8Q", "B001MVWRMU", "B00005JNEQ", "B002XKKX7K", "B002AK9UPO", "B0000CABBQ", "B00BY0EBK0", "B0000JBALO", "B004UXVDOA", "B00ITAQ2T6", "B00EIXWMII", "B007BMIGMO", "B000E6ES9Y", "B0007OY2N0", "B00DZP1C18", "B0018CWEYO", "B00G05I5SI", "B001DZOCVO", "B00361XWEQ", "B0053O89IS", "B00DJYJT5Q", "B003R0MF1W", "B000E8JO2S", "B00066FBQQ", "B0018CWEVW", "B000M343AI", "B00FWMVVI6", "B0027CSMY0", "B0006N2EZK", "B000QFCDAO", "B00AAQHNC2", "B00FWMVVHC", "B0007TKHKC", "B001XRLWPQ", "B00GTZWZ1M", "B0058YPJOU", "B002ZCY84U", "B0000AVHCD", "B0002DRE72", "B008BLCP0S", "B000H7JCHS", "B0013DZNAA", "B00FEVZH8K", "B00079FUI6", "B00I4581F4", "B000FIMG4U", "B007KXZM76", "B003UD7JC6", "B007MDB6Y2", "B00BC5I6Q2", "078321958X", "B009LDD4V4", "B000PC6A3E", "B001L1S1S0", "B005PYL4VU", "B00H1RMWYW", "B00915G6Q2", "B000U1ZV1W"], "bought_together": ["B000EHSVBE", "B000RO6JZE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EHSVBE", "B0027CSMY0", "B000RO6JZE", "B001B18716"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23767}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 24.48, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B000HT3P56", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MAXG8465L._SX342_.jpg", "title": "Boston Legal - Season 2"}

{"description": "Ernst Lubitch has long been recognized as the director of some of Hollywood's greatest comedies, including Trouble in Paradise (1932) and Ninotchka (1939). However, he made one of his best films while he was still an emerging filmmaker in his native Germany. The Wildcat, which was never released in the U.S., is a playfully subversive satire of military life that makes Robert Altman's M*A*S*H look positively tame by comparison. At a remote fort, the commander awaits the arrival of a new lieutenant, who is captured en route by a band of outlaws that roam the nearby, snow-covered mountains. But the daughter of the bandits' leader quickly falls for the young officer, thus setting in motion an outrageous farce that is Lubitsch at his most unrestrained. Peter Bogdanovich has described The Wildcat as \"an uproarious, hard-edged antimilitary spoof,\" and ranks the film among the five funniest movies he's ever seen (along with another early Lubitsch comedy, 1919's The Doll).The Wildcat not only looks ahead to Lubitsch's comedies, but can also be seen as an ancestor to Monty Python and the early, anarchic films of Woody Allen. This film's refreshingly unhinged approach is also reflected in its visual style, including a fortress that looks like a giant toy box and even the film's frame, which continuously changes size and shape. In Ernst Lubitch: Laughter in paradise, Scott Eyman states, \"In style, it is like nothing else committed to film,\" and ultimately dubs it \"an exercise in riotous artifice, as much pure fun as anything in Lubitch's canon.\"", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000JLQPWW", "B000EQHXIW", "B000066741", "B00BY8DDS8", "B00000J11G", "B0000633SZ", "B007R0PWUO", "B000BDH64E", "B000AYEIK4", "B001CD6HQA", "B00005O5CC", "B000BC8T0K", "B000094J79", "B0000WN1JA", "B00005QW58", "B000E0OBL0", "B004KZH5LI", "B00005M1ZO", "B0000E69GR", "B0031REQHW", "B0031REQHM"], "bought_together": ["B000JLQPWW"]}, "price": 17.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 155588}, "asin": "B000JLQPX6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PN2S6BSDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wildcat"}
{"description": "First screened in Europe and scheduled for limited release in the U.S.,The Illusionistoffers welcome proof that \"arthouse\" quality needn't be limited to the arthouses. Set in turn-of-the-century Vienna, this stately, elegant period film benefited from a crossover release in mainstream cinemas, and showed considerable box-office staying power--granted, teenage mallrats and lusty males may have been drawn to the allure ofSeventh Heavenalumna Jessica Biel, who rises to the occasion with a fine performance. But there's equal appeal in the casting of Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti, who bring their formidable talents to bear on the intriguing tale of a celebrated magician named Eisenheim (Norton) whose stage performance offends the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), a vindictive lout who aims to marry Duchess Sophie (Biel), Eisenheim's childhood friend and now, 15 years later, his would-be lover. This romantic rivalry and Eisenheim's increasingly enigmatic craft of illusion are investigated by Chief Inspector Uhl (Giamatti), who's under Leopold's command and is therefore not to be trusted as Eisenheim and Sophie draw closer to their inevitable reunion. Cleverly adapted by director Neil Burger from Steven Millhauser's short story \"Eisenheim the Illusionist,\" and boasting exquisite production values and a fine score by Philip Glass,The Illusionistis the kind of class act that fully deserved its unusually wide and appreciative audience. --Jeff ShannonBeyondThe Illusionist\"Eisenheim the Illusionist\" and Other StoriesPaul Giamatti in a More Loveable RoleMagic Kits & AccessoriesStills fromThe Illusionist", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000LC55F2", "B000NOIX48", "B002ZG980U", "B002WNU0QW", "B00DWZHTOU", "B001MZ5W3M", "B00011CZRE", "B000H0MKI8", "B00008K7AO", "B000L212HC", "B00AEBB8NI", "B000GFLKF8", "B000O76ZO4", "B00003CXZ4", "B00005JLSB", "B000FKO5QK", "B000M341QE", "B00AEFXGIY", "B00005V9HH", "B00AEBB8LA", "B00005JMOW", "B00096S49Y", "0767847415", "6305313687", "B004SIP9Z6", "B0047T74CM", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000R4SMCW", "B0002YLCG0", "B000P0J0EW", "B000HEWEE4", "B0041KKYHE", "B00BBI7EZY", "B00AEBBA2W", "B000CQLZ0Q", "0783235070", "0767802519", "B002ZG997C", "B00003CXHG", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000069HZP", "B004SIP7PS", "B003ASLJQI", "B00177Y9ZC", "B00005JLKN", "B003ZW9H68", "B001N44BVQ", "B002O3Z50Q", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005JN2Z", "B00AEBB86A", "B00000F4ZY", "B000MZHW40", "0671686402", "B00BB67UNW", "B005HP2J0M", "B000QXDED6", "B000NIVJF4", "B001F12J0C", "B000N6TX1I", "B000LAZE8C", "B00080ZG10", "B005LAIGRS", "B0009MDPYM", "0792159659", "B000OYC7BW", "B001UV4XGU", "B004AOECXI", "0767818105", "B000XR9L50", "B0018O4YT0", "B00015YVDG", "B004SIP8JI", "B00004XPPG", "B00006ZXSK", "B001DHXT20", "B0000AC8LR", "B009B8YMB0", "0783229402", "B0006210ZG", "B001PPGAIA", "B00004BZIY", "B008JFURII", "B00005JPAR", "B00006ADFM", "B004SIP7TE", "B000F5GNX8", "B000FS9FCG", "B006P0FIGU", "B00005JMCN", "B002VWNID6", "B004XQO90O", "B004EPZ084", "B00AEBB9M8", "B000P5FH3K", "B00005JNY3", "B000063US3", "B003L20IG0"], "bought_together": ["B000LC55F2", "B002ZG980U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000LC55F2", "B005LAIHXQ", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00DV2MVWO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 60145}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B000K7VHPU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nYghoS63L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Illusionist (Full Screen Edition)"}

{"description": "The feverish spectacle of a summer camp for evangelical Christian kids is the focus ofJesus Camp, a fascinating if sometimes alarming documentary. (Shortly after its release, the movie gained a new notoriety when Ted Haggard, president of the National Association of Evangelicals, who appears near the end of the film, resigned his post amid a male prostitute's allegations of drug use and sexual misconduct.) For most of the film, we follow a charismatic teacher, Becky Fischer, as she trains young soldiers in \"God's Army\" at a camp in North Dakota. Some of the kids emerge as likable and bright, and eager to continue their work as pint-sized preachers; elsewhere, the visions of children speaking in tongues and falling to the floor in ecstasy are more troubling. Even more arresting is the vision of a generation of children home-schooled to believe that the Bible is science, or Fischer's certainty that America's flawed system of democracy will someday be replaced by a theocracy. (In one scene, a cardboard cut-out of George W. Bush is presented to the children, who react by laying their hands on the figure as though in a religious procession.) Filmmakers Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady maintain neutrality about all this, maybe too much so (they throw in some interviews with radio host Mike Papantonio to provide a liberal-Christian viewpoint) and one would like to know more about the grown-ups presented here. Power broker Haggard is the creepiest person in the film, an insincere smooth talker whose advice to one of the young would-be campgoers comes across as entirely cynical. Time will tell whether the film's Christian soldiers will be marching onward.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000NIVJH2", "B001MFNB5I", "B000CAPZBC", "B000CCW2VG", "B001J21JRQ", "B00KY6YAO2", "B00008DDVV", "B001GCUO02", "B002I9Z8EO", "B0001NBNDY", "B001BEK8FQ", "B0010YSD7M", "B0000ACOXL", "B000092T6A", "B0000WN13Q", "B000UNYK4E", "B001M564BQ", "B000F48D78", "B000KX0IOA", "B003YJENZM", "0615509584", "B000C3L2IO", "B000T5MP72", "B002Z9JJXS", "B000ICL3KG", "B003ASLJQI", "B00005JN0T", "B001FACH7S", "B00DT55ORM", "B000AYEIY0", "B00AOCDEDY", "0988245108", "B0007WFYBG", "B001DWNUD8", "1939578191", "149217744X", "B008PZ69SE", "B000UNYJXQ", "B00470MG06", "B006TTC5MM", "B001E5FYS8", "B00009YXAS", "B000YHQNCI", "B000E5LEVU", "0767805712", "B000BMY2NS", "B003Q6D28C", "B00094AS72", "B0000SXK0Y", "1456588850", "B002HSD0J6", "B00007GVM0", "B00028HBIO", "B00A4TMLKE", "B002SAMMME", "B00005KHJY", "6305257442", "B00EL6AAEU", "B004CJQVQC", "B001DPHDA6", "B004EPYZPS", "1616141689", "B00F98FORM", "B00G3DA63Y", "B009MBSWUS", "B005LAIIHG", "B0047UJBP4", "0615927904", "B00BX49B6G", "B00005JKCH", "B00008RH3J", "B0030Y11XS", "B000BTH4K4", "B00006673L", "0767837991", "B000MTFFUO", "0783225733", "B000FBH3W2", "B00G0PXU2Y", "B0041KKYBA", "B000060MW1", "B00003CWN3", "B000XQ4HR8", "0393061027", "B000U6YJLU", "0231139624", "1478716568", "B001GMZGMI", "B00008DDJ6", "0143116649", "B000YY6VIC", "B001HZ30O0", "023033895X", "0671203231", "B00FGVRZT2", "B00094AS6I", "B0000DIJOO", "0195141830", "B001EDFSIQ", "B000A2XCBC"], "bought_together": ["B001MFNB5I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001MFNB5I", "B000CCW2VG", "B000NIVJH2", "B001J21JRQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 106626}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.83, "brand": "MAGNOLIA HOME ENTERTAINMENT", "asin": "B000KLQUV2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510JRNQD6DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jesus Camp"}
{"description": "Sometimes people are attracted to each other because of their differences. When there's a nebulous attraction between a teacher and a young teenage child--as in the superbHalf Nelson--the relationship has all the makings of confused disaster. Though there are a few uncomfortable moments when it's not obvious whether Dan (Ryan Gosling) and Drey (Shareeka Epps) might cross the line, the attraction between the pair is culled less from sexual tension than desperation. Dan is an idealistic history teacher in an inner-city school. Drey is one of his brightest students. For both, drugs represent something that may help them escape their worlds. He takes drugs to dull his dissatisfaction with himself. She views drugs as a possible way to better her life, even though she knows her brother's foray into that trade landed him in jail. Bleakly filmed and well told,Half Nelsonsoars because of the immaculate acting by Gosling and Epps. With his impish smile, Gosling provides a character that is at once disarming, alluring, and pitiful. As the young girl who's already seen too much hardship in her life, Epps plays her part with just the right amount of hardened raw emotion. While the ambiguous ending may not please fans weaned on happy Hollywood finales, it's a fitting and believable close to a thought-provoking film.--Jae-Ha KimStills fromHalf Nelson(click for larger image)BeyondHalf Nelsonat Amazon.comThe Films of Ryan GoslingMore Oscar Nominated Roles at the Amazon.com Oscar StoreThe Soundtrack", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004H83IG4", "B0036TGTDE", "B00049QQJ6", "B000E6ESL2", "B0014D5RBE", "B000R4SMCW", "B0060ZJ7DA", "B0064NTZQ2", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B00BEIYKM6", "B00E1LNDDU", "B0002I8372", "B00080ZGLU", "B0036TGTDO", "B003Y5H574", "B0060ZJ7AI", "B004P29LEA", "B00049QQHI", "B002A4IY3E", "B000FVQM2Y", "B005S9ELVC", "B00BEIYKSA", "B001TKK3O8", "B000683VI4", "B001E95ZNS", "B000I0QL7I", "B004H83IFA", "B000LAZDPG", "B0001EFUFK", "B002NOAFBK", "B00008K7AO", "B00A2H9QN8", "B000JBXXYK", "6305594333", "0792838068", "B00005JMJ4", "B0064NTZJO", "B000JBWWQA", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00HOGBXS6", "B003Y5H4R0", "B00K72HVBC", "6305692572", "B00A47BT7C", "B003EYVXTG", "B000AP04GK", "B00005JLRE", "B00D3LA5WG", "0859655016", "B003Y5H4W0", "B00DUX290S", "B006HGXGWU", "B00003CXKS", "B00114XTHA", "B0013XZ2QK", "B00009Y3QI", "B00005Q4CS", "B0014GI6I2", "B0013D8LCC", "B008220DGE", "B002XTXFU8", "B000YV1Q2G", "B00CX7OW1G", "B00112S8RS", "B0034G4P30", "B00AEFY17E", "B000I8OMEY", "B00094AS6I", "B00FRILRYS", "B001AS32QK", "B006OB3K56", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00A81MV3U", "B003EJO8KC", "B005KQVE1S", "B000ALM40I", "B00GMV8IVE", "B0016MOWOG", "B007REV4LQ", "B00AEFYCL4", "B00AFEXRME", "078401213X", "B00003CWTI", "B004O8OLO0", "B000YENUI6", "B004SIP7VM", "B002VECM4A", "B004QL7JYO", "B003UESJHO", "B00DW5IKYS", "B002XUBE0U", "B003Y5H57E", "B00FGVRZR4", "B00199PPP6", "B00H9KKGTO", "B000PAAJZ6", "B0082CWTSY", "B001CDFY7S", "B004H83IIC", "B0002DB52M"], "bought_together": ["B0014D5RBE", "B0036TGTDE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BEIYKM6", "B004H83IG4", "B000R4SMCW", "B0036TGTDE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 53034}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.98, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000KX0IOK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q%2BJ0%2BIGXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Half Nelson"}

{"description": "This very welcome box set turns up the heat on one of detective films' cold cases.  Created by Brett Halliday, Michael Shayne appeared in 31 books between the 1940s and '70s. He is not as popularly known as other screen shamuses, but he's good company. As portrayed by Lloyd Nolan (best known as curmudgeonly Dr. Chegley on the groundbreaking sitcomJulia), Shayne is not as hard-boiled as Sam Spade or as sage as Charlie Chan. But, as one shady character observes to someone whom Shayne has just pasted, \"You know better than to mix with Shayne.\" He's a working-class mug (\"His office is in his hat, his home is in his car,\" he remarks), usually \"down on his luck\" and short on cash. AsMichael Shayne, Private Detective(1940) opens, the furniture from his office is being repossessed. Still, Shayne has ethics enough to turn down $5,000 for a suspicious-sounding case. (\"$5,000 will buy a lot of ethics,\" he's told). He's got some odd habits, from twirling his keychain to singing the odd Irish ditty. In each film, Shayne manages to get himself into some \"screwy scrapes.\" InPrivate Detective, a \"gag\" backfires when an attempt to scare a gambling heiress straight results in a murder with Shayne's gun at the scene of the crime. InThe Man Who Wouldn't Die(1942), Shayne pretends to be a wealthy woman's husband to get the lowdown on a body that won't stay buried. InSleepers West(1941), he's on the right track when he accompanies a murder witness by train to San Francisco.Blue, White and Perfect(1942) is a real gem that finds Shayne embroiled in wartime espionage, smuggled diamonds and dodging his jealous, matrimonial-minded girlfriend.These lively B-films each clock in at less than 80 minutes. What they lack in budget they more than make up for in shadow-drenched, dark, and stormy atmosphere, Shayne's moxie and inestimable support from some great character actors, such as Clarence Kolb (the crooked mayor inHis Girl Friday) and Douglass Dumbrille (the nasty racetrack owner inA Day at the Races), who appear inPrivate Detective. For a collection of obscure films, this box set has all the trimmings, with three original featurettes that provide efficient primers on Halliday, Shayne, and Robert McGinnis, the artist who created luscious and lurid covers for the Shayne paperbacks. There is also an interactive trivia guide that makes the six-degrees connections between cast members and the film-noir world. This is volume 1, to which we can only say, \"Come back, Shayne.\"--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009X75CO", "B00CDV4OEC", "B00BH419CG", "B00BBI7EZY", "B00E44EZUE", "B003GW84R0", "B005XB8SWI", "B009TTGKS4", "B00CDV4LEA", "B0058K88K6", "B0018TN74I", "B000K7VHMI", "B000CC1TNI", "B000FKO3U8", "B000E8N9D8", "B00CTWSGA8", "B003Q9VXTY", "B0013K1AK0", "B00598OA7W", "B00ICWO1LC", "B0049IHWZK", "B001ARDBXK", "B007NU53PC", "B000SUHOEW", "B00CVB6XF2", "B007RKFXTE", "B000RXVND8", "B000SUHOFG", "B00I3RHVLS", "B009TTGLJM", "B00FXAP7SW", "B0085A9IWS", "B000YDMPCO", "B000NVL1YU", "B00DOZNGC2", "B00FX6TYZS", "B00383XZP8", "B0080QOK66", "B000EXDSAW", "B00KIZYDCI", "B002TCRQRC", "B000QGDJG0", "B008BSM1CI", "B000FWHW90", "B00AB2NX4M", "B000GY728I", "B0007ZEO7S", "B000CC1TPQ", "B0000WN0PA", "B000TLTCT0", "B0009X7678", "B0001HAGTW", "B0015ESZ8O", "B00D9EJFZA", "B000FWHW8Q", "B00AMU8K8C", "B0026ZQJT8", "B007SVMWBE", "B00FXAP4T4", "B008IG0F7G", "B00D9EJFV4", "B005STRKC4", "B0024FAG8A", "B002YNQEF6", "B005XO9EUA", "B00BDZV4PQ", "B000CNE08I", "B00000ILEU", "B002YNQEFG", "B005ETAN7C", "B000CC1TP6", "B00DZP1BVO", "B00HHYF55C", "B008MIYKS0", "B000BQ5IXW", "B002FOFXME", "B007V4ETS2", "B00BL3TQCI", "B009X919UE", "B00FX6U19Q", "B0081W1SZU", "B002BIULMQ", "B00DZP1C9K", "B00BDZV8TI", "B00AIA86OY", "B004QC6HGY", "B00020X86Q", "B001PPGAN0", "B0000694WM", "B00GHH9I62", "B00BY8DJW8", "B000EHSVJG", "B00598O9RI", "B00GWXI20E", "B005OK0YQQ", "B000KJTGFG", "B005DL6PO6", "B00I9BU60Q", "B00AOO5OY4"], "bought_together": ["B0009X75CO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0009X75CO", "B00BBI7EZY", "B00E44EZUE", "B00CDV4OEC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 77757}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.37, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B000LC4ZDK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-fD6MDduL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Michael Shayne Mysteries: Volume One"}
