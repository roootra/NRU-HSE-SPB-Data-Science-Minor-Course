{"description": "Anybody who has written him off because of his string of stinkers--or anybody who's too young to rememberThe Goodbye Girl--may be shocked at the accomplishment and nuance of Richard Dreyfuss's performance inClose Encounters of the Third Kind. Here, he plays a man possessed; contacted by aliens, he (along with other members of the \"chosen\") is drawn toward the site of the incipient landing: Devil's Tower, in rural Wyoming. As in many Spielberg films, there are no personalized enemies; the struggle is between those who have been called and a scientific establishment that seeks to protect them by keeping them away from the arriving spacecraft. The ship, and the special effects in general, are every bit as jaw-dropping on the small screen as they were in the theater (well, almost). Released in 1977 as a cerebral alternative to the swashbuckling science fiction epics then in vogue,Close Encountersnow seems almost wholesome in its representation of alien contact and interested less in philosophizing about extraterrestrials than it is in examining the nature of the inner \"call.\" Ultimately a motion picture about the obsession of the driven artist or determined visionary,Close Encounterscomes complete with the stock Spielberg wives and girlfriends who seek to tether the dreamy, possessed protagonists to the more mundane concerns of the everyday. So a spectacular, seminal motion picture indeed, but one with gender politics that are all too terrestrial.--Miles Bethany", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304143184", "0783231482", "6300182355", "6303506291", "6303212263", "B00005B238", "6300214060", "0790736233", "0783216084", "6303148352", "B00006AL1C", "6300268993", "6304508611", "0767825411", "6300183971", "6304509154", "6301300556", "6301670124", "6305363668", "B0000A36J1", "B000059HFB", "6300181286", "6300247236", "B00004RV8M", "B0000048TX", "B00000JQSV", "B00000JXVM", "B00000JGEK"], "bought_together": ["6304143184"], "also_viewed": ["B0087F7VSY", "6304143184", "6301792734", "B00000ILE6", "0783226152", "6301966732", "B00BBND56G"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 557907}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "", "asin": "076780192X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511NY005RKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Close Encounters of the Third Kind (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}

On the high seas during the dramatic battles of World War II, Queeg&#x2019;s by-the-book approach pushes his crew and his popular second-in-command, Lt. Maryk (Van Johnson), to the breaking point. After a series of questionable orders, Maryk confronts Queeg when he orders the ship directly into the path of a deadly typhoon. Maryk invokes naval code and relieves Queeg of his command, forcing the crew to mutiny. Once safely back in port, Maryk is court-martialed for treason, setting off a tense trial that exposes the true state of Queeg&#x2019;s mind. Nominated for Best Actor, Humphrey Bogart gives a searing performance as he is systematically broken down in this classic tale of military conduct in a time of war.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FZETR0", "B0049985XW", "B00AEFXD1O", "B003ZEQMH8", "B000FFJYAW", "B00005R23T", "B000FFJYAM", "B00AEFXRWO", "B00005A0QS", "B00007ELD1", "B000FFJYAC", "B00004XPPC", "B002VWNIAY", "B007FQXEQO", "B00005N5S3", "B00AEFYBA6", "B0001NBMH6", "B00AEBB9YQ", "B00AEFXLKC", "B000O78L0U", "B000FFJYA2", "B000HWZ4C0", "B000NTPG6Q", "B0007TKNM4", "B000A2WJBQ", "B000CNESN0", "B0000AMRUP", "B0007TKNGA", "B000MGTQ7U", "B00005JKF6", "B0002TSZHY", "B0045HCJ9E", "B00871C09S", "B007FQXEVY", "B00003CXBU", "0792838408", "B0018E03CW", "B000EHSVSC", "B0002HOEQ2", "B00008AOTR", "B000O78L00", "B0001WTWWE", "B00008AOTO", "0767802470", "B0010YSD7W", "B003AWRMCO", "B00011D1OK", "B00114XLTQ", "0792841670", "B00005PJ8S", "B000EHSVS2", "B000E5N6KW", "0792839730", "B0000EYUDY", "B0006B2A42", "B0087ZG7OI", "B0009ML2KQ", "B001D8W7EK", "B000GIXLUW", "B00005PJ8K", "B0002ERWZ0", "B00005JN9P", "B00AEBB932", "B003B3V0X4", "B00005N5S2", "B006WQUGI2", "B006FE83UE", "B00096S4B2", "B00AEBB8OC", "0316955108", "B007Y1NR1W", "B000H1RFQ4", "B00K6J7Q1Q", "B00004XPPE", "B00C3ALLFS", "B00006RCO3", "B00AMSQBNK", "B00005PJ6V", "B00006ADD5", "B00008MTVZ", "B0001NBMGC", "0783229488", "B004GSVXBW", "B000O599Z8", "B000O599NK", "B003NF97KS", "B00005AUK7", "B0001MXX1U", "B007N31YH0", "B00008K76U", "B000ASDFHC", "B00AATV07S", "B0001NBMHQ", "B00AEFYRJQ", "B00003CXHJ", "B000HWZ4CA", "B006VRRGOO", "B000O599NA", "B00005LC4D", "B000087F79"], "bought_together": ["B000FZETR0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003ZEQMH8", "B00871C09S", "B000ASDFH2", "B00AEFYBA6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 134007}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.49, "brand": "Columbia Pictures", "asin": "0767809688", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DRZNB3JQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Caine Mutiny"}

{"description": "Lou Diamond Phillips leaves a haunting impression as the late 1950s pop idol Ritchie Valens, who made the Latino influence in rock &amp; roll conspicuous through his hit songs. Filmmaker Luis Valdez (Zoot Suit) creates a nimble, exciting, and sympathetic portrait of the boy driven to rise above obstacles of race and family legacy, and Esai Morales is equally fine as Ritchie's envious, searching brother. Great support from Elizabeth Pe&ntilde;a and Danielle von Zerneck as Valens's sister and mother, respectively, and Joe Pantoliano is solid as the singer's straight-talking manager. Valdez brightens up the third act with a rock &amp; roll show featuring, among others, Brian Setzer as Eddie Cochrane. Marshall Crenshaw turns up as Buddy Holly getting on that plane with Valens, and Los Lobos (who actually performs Valens's music on the soundtrack) has a nifty cameo as a Tijuana band that gives Valens a piece of crucial inspiration.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000P0J0CY", "B0001CNQX0", "B00000K3TX", "B00004RJ71", "B0002DRDIW", "B0000714BS", "B0000714BQ", "B000002LC8", "B003NF97NK", "0783114907", "B00180IPM6", "B00007J5VO", "B005HFI7IU", "B003E1QDAI", "B00004ZESY", "B000K2UGZM", "B000AM4P90", "B00AEBB9IM", "B0009R1TJ0", "B00005N89M", "B002WJHBCC", "B00AEFY5TI", "B000KJU15U", "B000063JDI", "B00465I1CE", "B000RHRGSK", "B002XUBDRY", "B00AEBB9ZK", "B003VA3JZY", "B00EE8AIW4", "6305428409", "B000GJ0LLI", "B0042837D8", "B0009IOR6Q", "B00AEFXZJE", "B0000DIXDR", "B004AOECXI", "B000K2Q7CI", "B0009HLC9W", "B00004Y2R1", "B00CAYH200", "6305428271", "B000065V3H", "B001GD6VTE", "B00441GYZG", "B001AEF6BS", "B0042EJDGM", "B000B74GCA", "0767821769", "B001D0T4JY", "0767812387", "B000P0J0C4", "B00009AOBI", "0800141806", "B000E8QVWY", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00005V9IA", "B0002VGTBQ", "0783228686", "B00006FDCD", "6305428050", "B00006RCOC", "B000N3T0HI", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00E1HIX66", "6305744793", "B00009AOAX", "B00008L3U1", "B00AMSS3TA", "B000E8QVBU", "B00005JND5", "B000ERVK3A", "B00081U7HC", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00AEFY5B6", "B0002VEZ3U", "B000FOPPC4", "B008IG0F4Y", "B001DJLD12", "B00003CXPS", "B000068TPB", "B00069FL7C", "B004IKZQPW", "B00158K0R4", "B000H5TH20", "B00AEFXPG2", "B00AEBBADG", "B001BGS16W", "B00003CXTG", "B0002TT0MI", "B0087F7VSY", "B0000AQS5F", "076780421X", "0767812182", "B002BIULKS", "6305213305", "B00004TJKK", "B00027JZ3E", "B00075VX2C", "B00006RZ9Y"], "bought_together": ["B000P0J0CY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004RJ71", "B000P0J0CY", "B000A50460", "B0001CNQX0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8913}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "Philips", "asin": "0767821637", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R7P26XWQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "La Bamba"}

Jeroen Krabb&eacute; (The Fugitive), playing Beethoven's lifelong friend, attempts to discover who Beethoven's muse really was, becoming as driven as his friend in discovering the unlikely identity of the composer's \"immortal beloved.\" Through this we gain an insight into the nature of obsession, romance, and the heights and sacrifices of artistic achievement.

Converting to Christianity as a means of survival, Mahler carries on with his work but experiences an erosion of his health and sense of identity. Meanwhile, his self-effacing spouse represses her own creative drives to keep the resident genius afloat, plugging every leak and receding all but invisible into the woodwork.

{"description": "Another reliably well-crafted, generally engrossing documentary from Ken Burns,Lewis & Clarkemploys the director's now-familiar approach to his subjects, from its elegant juxtaposition of period illustrations and portraits against newly filmed footage of historic sites to Burns's repertory of accomplished actors to provide gravitas for quotes from the key figures. Granted the formula has become familiar enough to allow parody, but Burns knows how to invest his historical investigations with movement and drama, making this four-hour journey a worthwhile trip.As narrated by Hal Holbrook, Dayton Duncan's script explicates the agenda presented by Thomas Jefferson to Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, placing it in the context of the young country's gamble in Jefferson's Louisiana Purchase, and the expedition's goals for opening the West. While preserving the heroic scale of the undertaking, Burns also finds time to delve into the politics of the venture and the disparate personalities of the two explorers; in particular, Duncan and Burns look at the career of Lewis, the presidential prot&eacute;g&eacute;, his moody demeanor, and his  untimely death. The film also looks beyond its titular leaders to examine the personalities of their corps of soldiers, their boatmen, and the Indians they met and depended on, most notably their female Shosone guide, Sacagawea.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301996135", "630428957X", "B00006AUK1", "6303218725", "6304209908", "B00005N900"], "bought_together": ["630428957X"], "also_viewed": ["B00006AUK1", "0679454500"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 186485}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.4, "brand": "", "asin": "0780618831", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GXDB35DVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lewis &amp; Clark - The Journey of the Corps of Discovery [VHS]"}
{"description": "Although it received mixed reactions from critics and audiences alike when released in 1998, this supernatural thriller benefits from a sustained atmosphere of anticipation and dread, and its combination of detective mystery and demonic mischief is handled with ample style and intelligence. Under the direction of Gregory Hoblit (who fared better withPrimal Fear), Denzel Washington plays detective John Hobbes, who witnesses the gas-chamber execution of a serial killer (Elias Koteas). But when another series of murders begins, Hobbes suspects that the killer's evil spirit has survived and is possessing the bodies of others to do its evil bidding. Even Hobbes's trusted partner (John Goodman) thinks the detective is losing his grip on reality, but the dire warnings of a noted linguist (Embeth Davidtz) confirm Hobbes's far-out theory, and his case intensifies toward a fateful showdown. Although its idea is better than its execution, and the story's film noir ambitions are never fully accomplished, this slickly directed thriller has some genuinely effective moments in which evil forces are entwined into the fabric of everyday reality. Among the highlights is a memorable scene in which Detective Hobbes must track the killer as the evil spirit is transferred between many people via physical contact. Even if the film is ultimately less than the sum of its parts, it's an intriguing hybrid that resides in the same cinematic neighborhood asSevenandThe Silence of the Lambswith a cast that also includes Donald Sutherland and James Gandolfini.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783240295", "6304884400", "B00BTYOYG2", "6305065551", "B000OT6V0K", "B00005JPD0", "B000244GCC", "B00011CZRE", "6304765258", "B002NZK5UU", "B00441GZ1Y", "B0006210ZG", "B002LMV7R0", "B0000VJG72", "B002NZK5RI", "B00005JN0W", "B000GFLKF8", "B0001VTPUO", "B0000542CJ", "B000069HZP", "B00096S49Y", "B002ZG997C", "B00005JKWX", "B00005JA9F", "B00006AUJR", "078324228X", "0800141806", "6305718954", "B00AEFXEGS", "B00AEFXT1S", "B0002DB54A", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B001R3YRG2", "B00AFEXRME", "B0009MDPYM", "B0000549B2", "B002VWNIEA", "B005LAIGRS", "B002O3Z4WK", "0767818075", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B002AT8KAG", "B00AP2DC94", "B00AEFYF2K", "630514415X", "B000NQRR1Q", "B0001FR3IQ", "B00013RC7K", "B002ZG99TA", "B003BV8I3Q", "B00AEBB8LA", "B002CPMB9O", "B00009WVSL", "0767836286", "B00AEBBA2W", "B000R4SMCW", "B00005JNY3", "B00015YVDG", "B00026ZD04", "B0000648X0", "B002NZK5VO", "6305310335", "B00GS08UDU", "0800177789", "6305428115", "B0034G4P30", "0767817737", "B0045HCJ0S", "B00005Y1UV", "B000P0I4O4", "B00004BZIY", "0783230532", "B001UDS4BS", "6304698747", "B003UGLCIA", "B00005V9HH", "B00005LDDD", "B002AS466O", "0800177967", "B00008L3S6", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005UQ9W", "0792846443", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B009IV2Z7S", "B00AEBB95K", "B002AS464Q", "B00005JLRZ", "B002T9H2LA", "B00003CWU3", "B001N44BVQ", "B000TGJ80S", "B0001US62I", "B003AWRMCE", "0780618548", "B00JA3RVG4", "B00AEBB89W", "B000P0J0EM"], "bought_together": ["0783240295", "B00011CZRE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0050MB4OO", "B000NA1WEK", "6305065551", "B00005JN0W"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 118059}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 20.25, "brand": "TURNER HM ENTERTAINM", "asin": "0780622537", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71Q7T9SZ5HL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Fallen (Snap Case Packaging)"}

{"description": "Ice Cube wrote and stars as Craig in this sequel toFriday, which he also wrote. His nemesis from that film, neighborhood bully Debo (Tommy \"Tiny\" Lister Jr.), has just escaped from county jail and is out to get revenge. To protect Craig, Craig's father (John Witherspoon) sends his son to stay with his Uncle Elroy (Don \"DC\" Curry), who won the lottery and bought a house in Rancho Cucamonga. Craig expects the suburbs to be dull, but no sooner has he arrived than conflicts arise: The neighbors are hostile hoods, his cousin's girlfriend is out for blood and child support, and the house is about to be seized because of unpaid taxes. It's up to Craig and his cousin Day-Day (Mike Epps) to solve these problems before the day is over. It's a rambling, loose movie, but a genuinely entertaining one. Ice Cube doesn't write punch lines--though funny lines abound. He writes richly comic characters that speak in virtual arias of bragging, complaining, and scamming. Sure, some of the characters are stereotypes and many of the jokes are about drugs and scatology--but that's been the basis of humor since Plautus and Moli&egrave;re. The rhythmic energy of Ice Cube's dialogue and the easy charisma of his performance makeNext Fridaythoroughly enjoyable.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JLQT", "B002CA68MU", "B000063RQO", "B000069DOB", "6304821832", "B00003CY51", "B004P7CMZ0", "B002CA68N4", "B0041QSZS8", "6305505780", "B002CA68NO", "B00006HAYO", "B00AEFYE08", "0767811070", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00003GPFT", "B000OT6V64", "B0006HBZE2", "B00005JLG1", "1558908390", "B002CA68MK", "B002VWNIEA", "B0000YEE6M", "B00066FAQW", "B0034G4P1C", "B000FS9ULC", "B00003CXKD", "B00004STUL", "B0002B14UW", "B00007ELEO", "B00E1HIXA2", "B004SIP93S", "0767821955", "B00003CY5Y", "B0000DKDUR", "B0001Q4BOE", "0780627857", "0780627822", "B00006RVJR", "B00000JGHV", "155890834X", "B000PE0GRI", "B00005IBN0", "0767813901", "B00005JPK8", "B00008977B", "B0002J4YVK", "B0014QLEI6", "B00HX0KIAM", "B00003CXE4", "0783230524", "B002GSXKOM", "0783237367", "B00AEFYAC0", "B001KKU9DM", "B002CAWNEM", "B000TLOMPE", "B00003CXWV", "B000HDZKLO", "B0000AC8LH", "B000VG66XS", "0783225539", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00004Y2R1", "B00097DXFS", "B002IW8V1S", "B001AEF6HM", "B00003W8NT", "B00AEFY6TW", "B00177YFYM", "B000C20VRS", "B00AEFYQWO", "B000BITV9W", "B00008MTYF", "B00009ZPUA", "B0000AGQ6T", "B004SIP9I8", "B0002VYOVI", "B000F9SO0O", "B000P0J092", "B001J9KJ4I", "B00005U156", "0783240201", "B001QB9H10", "6305428409", "B001BP4K22", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00BEL4QFO", "B000BKVQS4", "B004499NII", "B004EPZ08O", "B00009W5F2", "B000YAF4Q6", "B000LW7REE", "B000KHYN9C", "B000WD3XKO", "B005DEUEYA", "B000EQ45CE", "B004SIP9E2", "B00E1HIX66"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLQT", "B002CA68MU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002CA68MU", "B001DJLD12", "B004H83INW", "B00005JLQT"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22939}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "0780631234", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517TXG4P43L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Next Friday"}

{"description": "Although it wasn't a box-office success when originally released in 1958,Vertigohas since taken its deserved place as Alfred Hitchcock's greatest, most spellbinding, most deeply personal achievement. In fact, it consistently ranks among the top 10 movies ever made in the once-a-decadeSight & Soundinternational critics poll, placing at number 4 in the 1992 survey. (Universal Pictures' spectacularly gorgeous 1996 restoration and rerelease of this 1958 Paramount production was a tremendous success with the public, too.) James Stewart plays a retired police detective who is hired by an old friend to follow his wife (a superb Kim Novak, in what becomes a double role), whom he suspects of being possessed by the spirit of a dead madwoman. The detective and the disturbed woman fall (\"fall\" is indeed the operative word) in love and...well, to give away any more of the story would be criminal. Shot around San Francisco (the Golden Gate Bridge and the Palace of the Legion of Honor are significant locations) and elsewhere in Northern California (the redwoods, Mission San Juan Batista) in rapturous Technicolor,Vertigois as lovely as it is haunting.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300183513", "0783235593", "0790743213", "6300183580", "6300181340", "6300215741", "0783235607", "6304039530", "6305123616", "0783236352", "6301798503", "0792839846", "6302909023", "B0002IXSVI", "0782008348", "0800132009", "1558807780", "0783222955", "0800100832", "6304359705", "0790744589", "B0007939NO", "6305576173", "6301670159", "6301564456", "0800113055", "630150528X", "6301670140", "6301647734", "0783235623", "0792837614", "6304151306", "B00871C09S", "B000003KIU", "0792837649", "B00000J2KZ", "6301586042", "6300267938", "B000059HGY", "630281622X", "6302241103", "6303854311", "6304935811", "6300215512", "0792837630", "B0045HCJ9E", "0792107683", "0783235704", "6302641888", "0783235674", "630236325X", "B00000J2L7", "0783235615", "B00000K3AN", "B00005LMA7", "6300184919", "6301797973", "6300181367", "B00000FZXC", "6301798732", "0782006809", "B000005QWI", "0780614097", "630266232X", "B0000040EO", "630251018X", "6300208133", "6302278929", "B00000I1DI", "6301797906", "1558804226", "6300268594", "6305363668", "6300270386", "6303430546", "0800116917", "6304383177", "6302510007", "B000M7BEPQ", "B00003OSTO", "6301797957", "6301973410", "630442972X", "6301025083", "6304457316", "6304383169", "0792837096", "6304071876", "6302510031", "6300182304", "6302413435", "6302797667", "6302281849", "6301986059", "6301975987", "6304196954", "6300251152", "6300246965"], "bought_together": ["6300183513", "6300183580"], "also_viewed": ["0792839846", "6304429274", "6304117752", "0783222955", "6304539258", "0790743213", "6304457383", "6303215734", "0783216084", "B00BWJQEC6", "0800100832", "B00000K3AN", "0800132009", "6301792769", "6305123616", "6304039530", "6304151306"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 271884}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.43, "brand": "", "asin": "0783221088", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JF1C6DF5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Vertigo (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "A somewhat contrived screenplay doesn't stop this thriller from serving up some of the most spectacular fire sequences ever committed to film. Like any Ron Howard productionBackdraftis impressively slick and boasts a stellar cast, including Kurt Russell and William Baldwin. The actors play sibling rivals who have been at odds since the death of their firefighter father years earlier. Robert De Niro is the veteran fire inspector who is tracking a series of mysterious and deadly arsons, and Donald Sutherland is effectively creepy as the former arsonist who understands the criminal psychology of pyromaniacs.

{"description": "Sydney Pollack's approach to audio commentary for DVD editions of his  films is different from that of most other directors. Instead of detailing each scene ofOut of Africa, for example, Pollack  paints in broad strokes, talking about cinematic themes and in particular the translation of Karen Blixen's life in Africa from book to film. The fan of flubs and trivia won't find Pollack making any cute remarks, but he's  certainly interesting for the run of the film, describing the location shooting in Africa and how he dealt with Robert  Redford's casting and lack of accent. The new 45-minute documentaryA Song of Africahas old and new interviews with Pollack and Meryl Streep, who clearly should have shared the film's commentary duties; she's insightful and quite fun to listen to.

{"description": "Suffering from the extreme bad luck of being released at the same time as the low-budgetThe Blair Witch Project, this adaptation ofThe Haunting of Hill Houseattempts to update Shirley Jackson's psychologically terrifying ghost story to the era of big-budget, computerized special effects. Does it work? Well, let's just say that showing isn't exactly the same as telling. A prime example of bloated studio filmmaking,The Hauntingtelegraphs all its frights so blatantly that it forsakes any of Jackson's subtle horrors for the remedial scares of a clunky carnival ride. The story remains basically the same, with four people called to an old mansion for experiments in the supernatural, but instead of getting inside the heads of its main characters (as the 1963 adaptation by Robert Wise did so well), Jan DeBont's film deserts character development for the huge, glorious set design provided by Eugenio Zanetti (Restoration). Thus, instead of a well-drawn story you get... a well-drawn house, one that four very talented and underutilized actors--Lili Taylor, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Liam Neeson, and Owen Wilson--wander around in endlessly (as Zeta-Jones puts it, the house is \"sort of Charles Foster Kane meets the Munsters\"). Taylor, as the hypersensitive Nell, is the unknowing lynchpin in the battle between good and bad ghosts and gets saddled with most of the expository dialogue of the mansion's gothic backstory. Zeta-Jones (showing some spark) and Neeson (showing none) are sadly reduced to providing reactionary shots of the film's disastrous climax, which mixes hapless new-age affirmations with computer-generated effects of ghosts and exploding windows, walls, doors, etc. For this haunted-house story, take a quick tour of the breathtaking rooms, but definitelydon'tstay the night.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CWRF", "B00005UQ9W", "B0045HCJJE", "B000063US5", "B003VA3JUO", "B002AS45VK", "B00AEBBA2W", "B0000C2IQQ", "B00005LIRD", "B002GHHHL0", "B00AEBBA72", "B00K2CHY1Y", "078322799X", "B004SIP92O", "B000V4UFZK", "B00AEFYXQI", "B00BEIYMAG", "B000CCBC9O", "B001BSBBGC", "B00E32PJ02", "B0000AOX0D", "B000UUX2Z0", "B000HC2LFI", "B0021L8UFI", "B00009PY4G", "0767824954", "B0010X73ZG", "B00AEBB91E", "0800177029", "B00AEFYYH6", "B0008191WO", "B00000IQVQ", "B00008LUNW", "B00003CXKM", "6305718954", "B00005JNY3", "B0002DB54A", "B004LWZW24", "B002VWNIDG", "B00DBNLBAQ", "0783116926", "B000GBEWRU", "0783225482", "B00AIBZLVY", "B004AC6PV2", "B0001FR3IQ", "B000GCFO0I", "B000NOIVT0", "B001B1872U", "B004P7CNUY", "B00004BZIY", "B00005JNBN", "B0009X763M", "B000NQRR1Q", "B00006FDCD", "B000AM6OQ2", "B00005O5B5", "0792839684", "B0000694XX", "B00000JQB5", "0780622650", "6305017115", "B003498SCQ", "1573625779", "B001B8XRT6", "B00000IQC4", "B00AEFXPMG", "6305300801", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00006AUIG", "B000TJ6PBK", "B0006SGYL0", "B004SIP9MY", "B001P3SA9Y", "B00023P4TM", "6305090564", "B000AM4P9K", "B00JPS7HOA", "B00B96TGQS", "B003UGLCIA", "B005LAIGOQ", "B004SIP9O2", "B00DZP1C9K", "B000ARXF96", "B004LWZW2O", "6305767866", "B002945DUW", "B000RIWAVW", "B000FFJYBG", "B00005JOWW", "B005TK23PQ", "B004XVMCN0", "B009XTF8KQ", "B001CFEC2Y", "B00006IUFV", "B00317LM8S", "B0021L8UPS", "B008874968", "6305428042", "B008JFUS0U"], "bought_together": ["B000063US5"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BTYXNRI", "B0045HCJJE", "B000ASATYO", "0783116926"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18281}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.84, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "0783237413", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51aYQx70GGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Haunting"}

{"description": "Thanks in large part to its meticulous re-creation of the late-1960s and early-'70s rock scene and the uncannily authentic performance by Val Kilmer as legendary Doors frontman Jim Morrison, Oliver Stone's hypnotic film biography is standing the test of time. Capturing the carefree mood of the Age of Aquarius, the film charts the meteoric rise of the Doors on the California club circuit (including a memorable scene showing the creation of the hit &quot;Light My Fire&quot;), and chronicles the band's exploits with hallucinogenics and Morrison's battles against charges of public indecency on stage. Kilmer's performance is hauntingly perfect, and performances by Meg Ryan, Kathleen Quinlan, and Kyle MacLachlan are similarly impressive. The movie doesn't fully probe the depths of Morrison's character, but as a portrait of excess it is vividly true to the spirit of the self-destructive poet known to his fans as &quot;The Lizard King.&quot;--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003H5WF3U", "0783233485", "B0090O07S2", "B000LPS4L6", "B0006ZE7G2", "B0002CTSXQ", "B005DJ62MS", "B000UCEJDC", "B00FWSWIIM", "B00003CXWV", "0385304471", "0679734627", "0671210440", "B0074JODC6", "0446697338", "B000002HJD", "0783229526", "B003VC6F44", "B002SRHC5Y", "B002AF4Y9G", "0679726225", "B0015UKX74", "B0069GRIHW", "0425170454", "B00029RTAI", "B00004ZBVO", "B00069FKX2", "B004SIP95G", "B0013K1ALE", "B00005JM23", "079284646X", "B000MCIBE8", "B00005JND5", "B00AEFXE9U", "1932855742", "B000002H92", "B000P0J0D8", "B001NXDSLQ", "B000MCIBAW", "0792846435", "B00AEBB9IM", "B0044R7VCK", "B002GIBVVQ", "B000PAAJZ6", "B00005V9HB", "0688119158", "B00006L929", "B000ZM1MGE", "B000002HRA", "B006TTC5HC", "B002XTXGCK", "6305127646", "B0011U8NZ2", "0767805763", "0991252527", "0767812182", "B00029RTCG", "B004SIP9Z6", "B0002V7ON8", "B000NO39FG", "B0009E3234", "B000MCIBB6", "B003ELKNH2", "B00AEFYCL4", "6304711905", "1556525893", "B001MFNB58", "B0085A9HU6", "B0038Z5T4Q", "B004MC98VY", "B00000K3TX", "B004FQX5B6", "B000065U1Q", "B000AXWHSA", "0446602280", "B007NYZ9S4", "B004FQX59I", "B0052FG750", "B004P7CN5O", "B000E8QVWY", "B000CNESTE", "B0000VV508", "B0010DJ174", "B00000IQW4", "B00005JKM2", "0760706182", "B00AEFYW64", "B004SIP9MY", "B00005Q4CS", "B00004XPPB", "B002G1K82Q", "B000F5GNX8", "B000031EFY", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00KCWV6KO", "B00008975Z", "B0034G4P6W", "B00INLE5K4", "B003HKN52U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0090O07S2", "B003H5WF3U", "B000UCEJDC", "B00FWSWIIM"]}, "price": 7.36, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 118937}, "asin": "0784010528", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71RG0C6WQWL._SY300_.gif", "title": "The Doors"}
{"description": "This is the film that cemented Schwarzenegger's spot in the action-brawn firmament, and it was well deserved. He's chilling as the futuristic cyborg who kills without fear, without love, without mercy. James Cameron's story and direction are pared to the bone and all the more creepy. But don't overlook the contributions of Linda Hamilton, who more than holds her own as the Terminator's would-be victim, Sarah Connor--thus creating, along with Sigourney Weaver inAlien, a new generation of rugged, clear-thinking female action stars.

{"description": "The only real problem withStir of Echoeshas nothing to do with the movie itself, but with unlucky coincidence. Adapted from a Richard Mathesonnovel, this film  arrived around the same time asThe Sixth Sense, and surface similarities made it suffer by cursory comparison and the competing film's phenomenal success. It's a pity, because this one features one of Kevin Bacon's best performances, in a psychological thriller that makes a lot more right moves than wrong ones. Bacon plays a blue-collar guy who laments his ordinary life, only to learn, when his sister-in-law (Ileanna Douglas) hypnotizes him, that he is a \"receiver\" capable of seeing spirits and split-second glimpses of past and future events. It's a torturous gift to have--especially since his friendly Chicago neighborhood possesses a dark secret--and Bacon plays the role with an appropriate mixture of obsession and internalized torment.Similarity toThe Sixth Senseapplies only to the basic premise and the character of Bacon's young son. Otherwise, this is more of a hard-edged journey of self-discovery, marital crisis, and recovery, with Bacon's wife (played by the highly underrated Kathryn Erbe) involved in an underdeveloped subplot about a group of people who share Bacon's gift as paranormal \"receivers.\" Furthering his career as a writer-director of intelligent thrillers, David Koepp makes a few missteps in pacing and thematic overkill, but overallStir of Echoesis a sharp, sensitive thriller that unfolds to reveal a dramatically satisfying solution to its mystery.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBBA2W", "B00004BZIY", "B00006AUJR", "B000VKKV3K", "B004SIP92O", "0800177789", "B00005JNY3", "6305718954", "B00007AJE1", "B000TJ6PBK", "B0001FR3IQ", "B00003CXKA", "B00AEFYYH6", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B0000648X0", "B002NZK5RI", "B00005JL3T", "0783222149", "B000V4UFZK", "B003VA3JUO", "B00003CWRF", "B000HT38IK", "B00009WVSL", "B0097C046W", "B00005JH9M", "B00008DDGY", "0783116926", "B004LWZW24", "B004AC6PV2", "B00008EY9G", "B0009X763M", "0783226837", "B0021L8UFI", "0783240295", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00011CZRE", "B00005UQ9W", "B004EPYZO4", "B002DKGWSE", "B0021L8UXA", "B0024FADD8", "B003ASLJQS", "6305161933", "155890848X", "B0001GF2D8", "B00064LJVE", "B009XTF8KQ", "B000Y7U97I", "B002GHHHN8", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00005JKZH", "B002JT69IW", "0767817737", "B00AEFYF2K", "6304711891", "B00KU2ZKKI", "0792840127", "B005LAIGOQ", "B001KKU9CI", "B001JNNDJM", "B00AZTUUQK", "B000U7169M", "B00026ZD04", "B002VWNIDG", "B002O3Z4WK", "B00AJLHUA8", "B003L20IEW", "B0002IQLHQ", "B000AM4P9K", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00IJS2OR2", "B00009PY4G", "B000OVLBGM", "B001BP4K22", "B001R3YRG2", "B0002234LS", "B0000694XX", "B00B96TGQS", "B002AT8K9W", "B000NIVJF4", "B000HC2LFI", "6305065551", "B00AIBZKV0", "B00013RC7K", "B004SUDQDG", "0792159659", "B000GFLKF8", "B0021L8UPS", "B00AEBB91E", "B000PMLJMQ", "B0001IMCFC", "B002NZK5SM", "6305428115", "B000LP6KNU", "B00006FDCD", "6304806434", "B00AEFXKZ8", "B008Y1YK7G", "B0006SGYL0"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBBA2W", "B00004BZIY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004SIP92O", "B004AC6PWG", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00004BZIY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 163731}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.99, "brand": "Lions Gate", "asin": "0784013470", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71YSZMKZKXL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Stir of Echoes"}
{"description": "This 1989 drama penned by pre-Basic Instinctscreenwriter Joe Eszterhas is a powerful tale of family identity and loyalty threatened by a ghost from the Third Reich. Jessica Lange stars as a Chicago criminal attorney whose beloved immigrant father (Armin Mueller-Stahl, in his American film debut) is accused of once having been a monstrous SS officer for Hitler. While Lange's character does a good job defending the old man in court against witnesses who charge him with numerous unspeakable acts, her own certainty that  he is innocent slowly crumbles, leaving her with a horrifying personal dilemma. Directed by Costa-Gavras (Z), the film displays some of his distracting tendency toward unnecessarily broad storytelling, but Eszterhas's script is disciplined and moving, and Lange and Mueller-Stahl are stunning in their depiction of a loving relationship deeply shaken by history.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00006349J"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 488600}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.96, "brand": "", "asin": "0784011486", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31BE03EB0SL.gif", "title": "Music Box [VHS]"}
{"description": "It always comes up when people are comparing their most traumatic movie experiences: \"the death of Bambi's mother,\" a recollection that can bring a shudder to even the most jaded filmgoer. That primal separation (which is no less stunning for happening off-screen) is the centerpiece ofBambi, Walt Disney's 1942 animated classic, but it is by no means the only bold stroke in the film. In its swift but somehow leisurely 69 minutes,Bambicovers a year in the life of a young deer. But in a bigger way, it measures the life cycle itself, from birth to adulthood, from childhood's freedom to grown-up responsibility. All of this is rendered in cheeky, fleet-footed style--the movie doesn't lecture, or make you feel you're being fed something that's good for you. The animation is miraculous, a lush forest in which nature is a constantly unfolding miracle (even in a spectacular fire, or those dark moments when \"man was in the forest\"). There are probably easier animals to draw than a young deer, and the Disney animators set themselves a challenge with Bambi's wobbly glide across an ice-covered lake, his spindly legs akimbo; but the sequence is effortless and charming. If Bambi himself is just a bit dull--such is the fate of an Everydeer--his rabbit sidekick Thumper and a skunk named Flower more than make up for it. Many of the early Disney features have their share of lyrical moments and universal truths, butBambiis so simple, so pure, it's almost transparent. You might borrow a phrase from Thumper and say it's downright twitterpated.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["155890641X", "0788812807", "6302642248", "0788802194", "6302320402", "6304401132", "078881172X", "6304500831", "6303314015", "6300274195", "0788812408", "6302526574", "6302787068", "6302961572", "6300274268", "6305229449", "6303983812", "0788803743", "6304089767", "B0000AQZYM", "B000035Z2S", "6305319138", "6300275310", "0788805843", "0788805533", "6303929338", "6302158095", "6302178924", "6304100507", "B00005JKDQ", "6304400551", "6305326940", "6304290888", "6304978286", "6304400225", "6305940932", "B00004R99N", "6303036813", "6301390725", "B00003CX7L", "B0000E32WB", "6304089201", "B00000ICHA", "B000B8QG3G", "B0000524CZ", "6302426200", "6304501153", "B00003CXQX", "B00005T7H6", "1558906150", "6300274608", "B00000JS61", "6303534422", "B0009SUS4Q", "6304400381", "B00004R99I", "B000009CTR", "6302484359", "6301991311", "B00005RDVV", "B0007A2GSM", "B00003CXHR", "0788811002", "B000035Z46", "B00005RRG3", "6300276554", "6303122647", "6303123244", "6304401736", "0788812181", "B00006IUM9", "1558901892", "6301948106", "6305942285", "6300277003", "B00003CWPW", "6304015127", "B00007AJLB", "B00005JL95", "0788810634", "6304873441", "6303295614", "6303939015", "0783236689", "6304117752", "B00016JF2W", "B000BAVLYS", "0788812440", "B0002YLCHE", "6302481805", "6304155972", "6303991408", "B00008Y47S", "B00003CXXI", "B000B8QG4A", "6302961661", "B00003CXQ6", "B0001I55VK", "B00004YNUH"], "bought_together": ["155890641X", "0788802194"], "also_viewed": ["155890641X", "0788802194", "6303314015", "0788812408", "6304500831", "6302526574", "6302320402", "078881172X", "6302642248", "6302787068", "0788812807", "6300274195", "6304401132", "6302961572", "6304089767", "6300274268", "0788805843", "B000035Z2S", "6304290888", "0788805533", "6305319138", "6303983812", "6305229449", "6303929338", "6300275310", "6302178924", "6304400551", "B0000AQZYM", "6302158095", "6303534422", "B00005JKDQ", "B0007KTBIU", "6305326940", "B00003CXQX", "6304501153", "6303036813", "B000B8QG3G", "6304100507", "B00004R99N", "6305940932", "B00003CXHR", "6304978286", "B000035Z46", "B00005JL95", "B00005RDVV", "B005JQFQ5Y", "B00003CX7L", "6304873441", "6304089201", "6304400225", "6302426200", "6301991311", "6304401736", "0788811002", "B0000524CZ", "6300274608", "6301390725", "B00016JF2W", "B00004REYY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 63167}, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Children's Music", "Disney"], ["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.94, "brand": "Disney", "asin": "0788806270", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DVF3SBVRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bambi (Walt Disney's Masterpiece) [VHS]"}
{"description": "Disney's adaptation of the beloved fairy tale became a classic in its  own right, thanks to some memorabletunes(including \"A Dream Is a Wish  Your Heart Makes,\" \"Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo,\" and the title song) and some endearingly cute comic relief. We all know the story--the wicked stepmother and stepsisters simply won't have it, this uppity Cinderella thinking she's going to a ball designed to find the handsome prince an appropriate sweetheart, but perseverance, animal buddies, and a well-timed entrance by a fairy godmother make sure things turn out all right. There are a few striking sequences of pure  animation--for example, Cinderella is reflected in bubbles drifting through the air--and the design is rich and evocative throughout. It's a simple story padded here agreeably with comic business, particularly Cinderella's rodent pals (dressed up conspicuously like the dwarf sidekicks of another famous Disney heroine) and their misadventures with a wretched cat named Lucifer. There's also much harrumphing and exposition spouting by the King and the Grand Duke. It's a much simpler and more graceful work than the more frenetically paced animated films of today, which makes it simultaneously quaint and highly gratifying.--David Kronke", "related": {"also_bought": ["155890641X", "6304401132", "0788812408", "6302526574", "0788806270", "0788812807", "6303314015", "6302642248", "6302787068", "078881172X", "6302320402", "6304500831", "6305229449", "6300274268", "6300274195", "B000035Z2S", "0788803743", "6303983812", "6304089767", "0788805843", "6302961572", "6303929338", "6300275310", "6304290888", "6305319138", "B0000AQZYM", "6302178924", "6304400551", "B00005JKDQ", "0788805533", "6305940932", "6302158095", "B00003CX7L", "B00005T7H6", "6304978286", "6305326940", "6304501153", "6304089201", "B00003CXQX", "6304100507", "B00000JS61", "B0009SUS4Q", "6303534422", "B00005RDVV", "B00000ICHA", "6304400225", "B000JBWWRO", "B00004R99N", "6300274608", "B00005JL95", "6303036813", "6304873441", "B00005JKX3", "6304117752", "0788811002", "1558901892", "B00003CXHR", "6301390725", "6303122647", "6303939015", "0788812440", "6305942285", "1558906150", "B0000524CZ", "6300276554", "6301991311", "0792839129", "0788810634", "B00004R99I", "B0000E32WB", "6302426200", "B00003CWPW", "6304492960", "6304400381", "6301948106", "6301750667", "6304492952", "0788809806", "6302642493", "6303439357", "6303123244", "B000035Z46", "B00016JF2W", "6304401736", "B00003CXXI", "B00004REYY", "B00005RDWC", "6304155972", "078880720X", "6302484359", "B00003CXG6", "080013558X", "6302409780", "B00005K9OA", "B00005RRG3", "6305177473", "6300276864", "B00006IUM9", "B00000G3AV"], "bought_together": ["155890641X", "6304401132"], "also_viewed": ["155890641X", "0788806270", "0788812408", "6303314015", "6304401132", "6302526574", "078881172X", "6302320402", "6302642248", "0788812807", "6304500831", "6300274268", "6302787068", "6304089767", "B000035Z2S", "6303983812", "0788805843", "6305229449", "6300274195", "6302961572", "B0000AQZYM", "6304400551", "6305940932", "0788805533", "6303929338", "6302178924", "6300275310", "B00005JKDQ", "6304290888", "6304100507", "6303534422", "6304978286", "6305319138", "6305326940", "6302158095", "B00003CX7L", "B0007KTBIU", "B00003CXQX", "B00005JL95", "B00005RDVV", "6304400225", "B00004R99N", "6304501153", "B00003CXHR", "B00005T7H6", "6303036813", "6304737491", "6304089201", "B00004R99I", "6302426200", "6301991311", "B000JBWWRO", "B000035Z46", "0788812440", "B00003CXCQ", "B00006CXK5", "B0000E32WB", "6304401736"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 49761}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.99, "brand": "The Walt Disney Company.", "asin": "0788802194", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JRS7PR6VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cinderella (Walt Disney's Masterpiece) [VHS]"}

{"description": "From the moment that Prince Eric's ship emerged from the fog in the opening credits it was apparent that Disney had somehow, suddenly recaptured that \"magic\" that had been dormant for thirty years. In the tale of a headstrong young mermaid who yearns to \"spend a day, warm on the sand,\" Ariel trades her voice to Ursula, the Sea Witch (classically voiced by Pat Carroll), for a pair of legs. Ariel can only succeed if she receives true love's kiss in a few day's time and she needs all the help she can from a singing crab named Sebastian, a loudmouth seagull, and a flounder. The lyrics and music by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken are top form: witty and relevant, and they advance the story (go on, hum a few bars of \"Under the Sea\").Mermaidput animation back on the studio's \"to do\" list and was responsible for usheringBeauty and the Beastto theaters.

{"description": "Ever since the late '70s when the Australian New Wave was in full surge, Down  Under directors have delivered movies that often hit you like news from another planet. Offbeat characters, weird narrative twists, and a tart  mixture of laughs and catastrophe--this is the juice that fuels such flicks asProof,The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,Strictly Ballroom,Heavenly Creatures, and most certainlyMuriel's Wedding. Directed by P.J.  Hogan (who would go on to helm the Hollywood hitMy Best Friend's Wedding),  this little gem follows tradition by featuring an authentic misfit: Muriel  (Toni Collette), a great overweight horse of a girl obsessed with getting  married and the music of ABBA. Appropriately, we first meet Muriel at a  wedding, all trussed up in a leopardskin number she's boosted for the  occasion. When her snotty peers insist that she give up the bridal bouquet to  someone who might actually get hitched, when one of the guests turns out to be a clerk in the very store where Muriel ripped off her outfit--you gotta  laugh, she's such an unmitigated mess. A loser, her philandering politician father (Bill Hunter) calls her--along with his doormat wife and his other  couch-potato offspring. But this movie's no exercise in geek-bashing. As  Muriel takes up with feisty Rhonda (Rachel Griffiths) and moves from Porpoise  Spit to the big city, her good-hearted grin and zest for life draw us in  despite hilarious gaffes and mishaps. (Making out with a boy for the first  time, Muriel suddenly finds herself awash in styrofoam: the oaf has unzipped  the beanbag chair instead of her skin-tight leather pants.)Muriel's Weddingcovers territory Hollywood would banish from a comedy--Rhonda's cancer, the  suicide of Muriel's mother, a marriage of convenience to an arrogant  athlete--yet, like its heroine, it never loses its sense of humor, its will to move on to whatever good thing might happen next. Everyone in the  idiosyncratic cast is terrific, but it's Toni Collette's Dancing Queen who  makesMuriel's Weddinga cinematic celebration you won't forget.--Kathleen  Murphy", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SIPAJG", "B00001U0DW", "B001CDR1F6", "0792843983", "B0000714BP", "B004VJJGFG", "B00BXL249K", "B00005JN1K", "B000089794", "B00006FMUW", "6305428425", "B000CCBCAS", "B00005JNC5", "B00003CXPD", "0792833198", "B0001HAGRE", "B000CCW2P2", "B00EPH8SBM", "B0045HCJGW", "B008NNY8TK", "B00BTYJYR6", "B001GKJ2DY", "0767827740", "B00A33J8YS", "B00CMQIDKY", "B00005JLD4", "B00DW5IJR6", "B003EYVXQ4", "B007UW9W5U", "B000002GLW", "B000ETRCN0", "B00005ALS0", "B00BAYLS1K", "B0001L3LUO", "B00AEFYNG8", "B00006AW0I", "6305283516", "B004XVMCQ2", "6305882592", "B000001DZO", "B000EHRVOW", "B001PPGAIA", "B004U7MR4G", "B0016MJ6T2", "B000087F7Q", "B000023VTP", "B00001W9G0", "B000AYYVME", "B0000542C7", "B00005N5SA", "B008LFYZAM", "B001DB6J6Y", "B00KNALRZ4", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00003CY5G", "B00005K3NU", "B0011FDVD6", "B00006ZXSL", "B00004TWZH", "B004D45NYC", "B00005JL7Q", "B000FO0AA6", "B000J103OI", "B005EVJCOA", "B00004VVMZ", "B00DL46ZN8", "B0045HCJRG", "0783225482", "B000068V9U", "B0001WPQJ2", "B00005JKGK", "B000063ING", "B007UW9W32", "B000092T3P", "B000765IJK", "B000069HZP", "B00AEFY4TO", "B000035Z5H", "B00005JNDZ", "0857687247", "B000NA1WDQ", "B004SIP9VA", "B000ELJAEM", "B0007IO6NM", "6304696558", "B004XVMCMG", "B0021L8UOY", "B00AEFY4CG", "B002GHHHJC", "B0053TWVQ4", "B001C47ZOW", "B0043X1FOU", "B009B1EPQ4", "B0000A02Y4", "B00008R9KD", "B0064MT1FI", "B0001I55M4", "6305622914", "B00CPIXOEY"], "bought_together": ["B004SIPAJG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0792843983", "B0000714BP", "0792833198", "B00EPH8SBM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 57288}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.99, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "0788814958", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/7176GF4V61L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Muriel's Wedding"}

{"description": "Todd Haynes, ever unpredictable, follows up his experimental trilogyPoisonand his restrainedSafewith this flamboyant study in glam rock through the kaleidoscopic lens ofCitizen Kane. Christian Bale plays Arthur Stuart, a reporter sent to investigate the legend of rock legend and bisexual pop icon Brian Slade (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as a not-so-thinly veiled David Bowie), who disappeared a decade ago after staging his own mock assassination. But Arthur is flooded with memories of his own adolescence as he interviews Slade's friends and business associates, peeling back the layer of makeup and spangles that was the model of rebellion for a generation of middle-class British kids and discovering a hollow center. Ewan McGregor almost steals the film as the punk pioneer Curt Wild (equal parts Iggy Pop and Kurt Cobain), the genuine article to Slade's calculated, coifed image of glitter stardom.  Haynes's film lacks nothing in capturing the flamboyance and spectacle of the era with flashy filmmaking and kitschy costumes, and if the plot seems lost in the preening and visual fireworks, perhaps that's the point: behind the fa&ccedil;ades and manufactured fronts is nothing but glitter, energy, and a beat.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000DLV3", "B00005QW5X", "B005TTEFZ8", "B000FO0AD8", "B0002JZT5A", "B00004ZBVO", "B00005UW73", "B000EQHXNW", "B001KEHAEE", "B000RIWAVC", "076782153X", "B00C7T0EPS", "B000255LIY", "B00080ZHD2", "B000GIXLXE", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00BTYXNPK", "B005M2AKJW", "0767819772", "B0079K4WEE", "B00020VZTS", "0783241909", "B0050ODZ6M", "B0006FO8E8", "B007WZTMCI", "B002ZG97O2", "B0013D8L7C", "B000HRMAPE", "B00009MEKN", "B002ZG9800", "B004XNNUZ2", "B004A8ZWV0", "6305499144", "B008N25X7M", "B00GTZWVXE", "B00133KFGW", "B0000A1HQI", "0786883995", "B0013D8LC2", "B007CEFTSA", "B0000648YK", "B00HQVB0Q4", "B000E6ESL2", "B0042RJWTC", "B000MGB6NM", "B00IKM5NJS", "B00005JLQH", "6305428093", "B00005JLHW", "B000E6ESKS", "B00IA7MFEO", "B00005JM2Y", "B000CBCWIK", "B0016MJ6T2", "B000059PQB", "B004MRX8D8", "B0083V2VYG", "1892649462", "B00GHP8SH4", "B0036TGSR6", "B000065V3W", "B00023P4I8", "B0013D8LCW", "B0007Y08QA", "B000KX0IM2", "B00CC2V7AQ", "B004THJ3BC", "B00008YLUX", "B004SIP8WU", "B000089760", "B002DLB1I4", "B002VJVCN2", "B001CC7PLM", "B00E5PHTR8", "B0009A40ES", "B00FRILRW0", "B000F6II1M", "B000P12LWY", "B001QUF3SW", "B000PAAJZ6", "B00996RSYM", "B00FGG60XY", "B006OB3K56", "B00005V5NU", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00F98FOPE", "B001FBSLPE", "B00GS08Y3Q", "B00CBFB8QC", "B00014NE62", "B008JFX04G", "B0002I84JO", "B004SEUJXM", "B001BMN35K", "B000EHRVOM", "B00005JKJA", "B000E5KURY", "B00BSN0VZW", "B00GSA3K6C"], "bought_together": ["B00005QW5X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005QW5X", "B00000DLV3", "B000RIWAVC", "B00004ZBVO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 172306}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.39, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "0788815741", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JW0WJSRRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Velvet Goldmine"}
{"description": "Do you know anyone who hasn't seen this movie? A box-office smash when released in 1993, this spectacular update of the popular 1960s TV series stars Harrison Ford as a surgeon wrongly accused of the murder of his wife. He escapes from a prison transport bus (in one of the most spectacular stunt-action sequences ever filmed) and embarks on a frantic quest for the true killer's identity, while a tenacious U.S. marshal (Tommy Lee Jones, in an Oscar-winning role) remains hot on his trail. Director Andrew Davis hit the big time with this expert display of polished style and escalating suspense, but it's the antagonistic chemistry between Jones and Ford that keeps this thriller cooking to the very end. In roles that seem custom-fit to their screen personas, the two stars maintain a sharply human focus to the grand-scale manhunt, and the intelligent screenplay never resorts to convenient escapes or narrative shortcuts. Equally effective as a thriller and a character study, this is a Hollywood blockbuster that truly deserves its ongoing popularity.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790736411", "0767803434", "B00AEBB9UK", "B00008K76W", "B002NZK5R8", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000055Y0Y", "B00008K76V", "B004IK30MI", "B002NZK5UU", "B000CEV3M8", "B0045HCJ8K", "B00AEFXYJA", "B00008K76U", "0783225733", "B0045HCJFS", "B000O77SRC", "B000F8DV1M", "B00AEBB9NM", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B000EGDB10", "0800141601", "B002AT8K9W", "6305428115", "B0006GANOQ", "B00026ZG10", "6304711891", "B003ASLJIQ", "6304806434", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00AEFYF2K", "B000NTMA0Q", "0783240295", "B002NZK5VO", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00015YVDG", "B00AEBB8YW", "0790732238", "B002GIBVVG", "B00004STDN", "B002AT8KAG", "B00AEFXBG6", "B00AEFXVOI", "B000SFOW8I", "B002VWNICC", "B000U1ZV8K", "B002GHHHP6", "B00009WVSL", "B00008G8M4", "B002AS464Q", "B000PHVZNE", "B003AWRMBA", "0790732149", "B0007IO6NM", "B001ECDVJU", "B00AEBBA2W", "0783226888", "B000QUCRB4", "6305213283", "6304765258", "6304765266", "6305133468", "B00005B6JZ", "B002O3Z50G", "B00000G3PA", "B0043X1FNQ", "B000FO0AA6", "B00003CXGV", "B004AOECXI", "B00096S49Y", "B0014C2FX8", "6305236569", "B003ASLJMW", "B0014Z4OMU", "B000P0J0EM", "0790730979", "B0006N2EZ0", "0783222149", "B001LXIDW2", "0783226942", "B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B00158K0QU", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00AEFXEGS", "0780618548", "0783235070", "B00004XPPG", "B0045HCJGC", "B000FO0A9W", "B0000AOV4I", "B000YCPUWW", "B00177YA1K", "630471193X", "B007SPPANM", "0792844874", "B00081U7HC"], "bought_together": ["0790736411", "0767803434"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000JYW5BE", "B004LWZW4M", "B000UBMSB8", "B0054OGQM8"]}, "price": 17.75, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 201394}, "asin": "079072961X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514VJP0EEHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Fugitive"}
{"description": "Thanks to the ambitious vision of director Tim Burton, the blockbuster hit of 1989 delivers the goods despite an occasionally spotty script, giving the caped crusader a thorough overhaul in keeping with the crime fighter's evolution in DC Comics. Michael Keaton strikes just the right mood as the brooding &quot;Dark Knight&quot; of Gotham City; Kim Basinger plays Gotham's intrepid reporter Vicki Vale; and Jack Nicholson goes wild as the maniacal and scene-stealing Joker, who plots a takeover of the city with his lethal Smilex gas. Triumphant Oscar-winning production design by the late Anton Furst turnsBatmaninto a visual feast, and Burton brilliantly establishes a darkly mythic approach to Batman's legacy. Danny Elfman's now-classic score propels the action with bold, muscular verve.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000P0J06U", "B001OST0LW", "B001OST0M6", "B00005JNJV", "B001GZ6QC4", "B000IJ79UW", "B004LWZWGA", "B00005LOUK", "B001AGXEAG", "B000IJ79WU", "B0000VD04M", "B00005JKCH", "B000IJ79XE", "B00AEBBA72", "B000IJ79X4", "B002VWNIDG", "B004LWZW42", "B00005JMQW", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001CK1D44", "B000J10EQU", "B009JBWOU0", "B0000AC8LI", "B0006L0LOS", "6304698739", "B001VLBDD0", "B001ECDVKE", "B0000959N0", "B008JFUPFI", "B000EGDB10", "B00LBHOCHS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B000OT6V64", "6304711891", "B002VWNID6", "B000AQOHNA", "B000AYELVA", "B00F4FFO8E", "B000A9QKL4", "B00DP9MDE4", "B00005JNTU", "B000BZISVM", "0780630890", "0780630882", "B0014Z4ON4", "B000RW3VCK", "B000P0J0AG", "B0090SI56Y", "B002GSXKN8", "B00005N7Z1", "B000AYELVU", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00005R2IS", "B004FQX5B6", "0790731924", "B00AEBB9NM", "B00007AJGH", "B00005T7I1", "B000P0J0A6", "B000M341QE", "B000P0J09M", "0792844866", "B004SIP95G", "B000VI70QS", "B004L9GMBC", "B00027JZ3E", "B0001BKAEY", "B000A9QKLE", "B0014C2FX8", "B000V4UFZK", "B003XURDAY", "B00008G8M5", "B00070FX5U", "B00GZ0ML2Y", "B000O77SQS", "B004SIP9Z6", "B0007G89FU", "B000UR9T8C", "B001QB9H1U", "B000RTB0R6", "B00177YA1K", "B00008G8M4", "B004SIP9O2", "B00AEBB9FA", "B00005ATZT", "B000FS9FCG", "B0009UZG28", "B000P0J09W", "B001CDR1FG", "B00005N5S5", "6305767866", "B0087F7VSY", "B00081912E", "B001TK80C0", "0780630858", "B004YJMQHI", "B00AEBB9DM", "B007K3JFUQ", "6304712987", "B0001GOH6Q"], "bought_together": ["B000P0J06U", "B001OST0LW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002GSXKN8", "B00005JNJV", "B000B5XOSO", "B00C2IGQBA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 141600}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.0, "brand": "WARNER STUDIOS", "asin": "0790729652", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41SYDPY4YPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Batman (1989)"}
{"description": "Stanley Kubrick'sThe Shiningis less an adaptation of Stephen King's bestselling horror novel than a complete reimagining of it from the inside out. In King's book, the Overlook Hotel is a haunted place that takes possession of its off-season caretaker and provokes him to murderous rage against his wife and young son. Kubrick's movie is an existential Road Runner cartoon (his steadicam scurrying through the hotel's labyrinthine hallways), in which the cavernously empty spaces inside the Overlook mirror the emptiness in the soul of the blocked writer, who's settled in for a long winter's hibernation. As many have pointed out, King's protagonist goes mad, but Kubrick's Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is Looney Tunes from the moment we meet him--all arching eyebrows and mischievous grin. (Both Nicholson and Shelley Duvall reach new levels of hysteria in their performances, driven to extremes by the director's fanatical demands for take after take after take.)The Shiningis terrifying--but not in the way fans of the novel might expect. When it was redone as a TV miniseries (reportedly because of King's dissatisfaction with the Kubrick film), the famous topiary-animal attack (which was deemed impossible to film in 1980) was there--but the deeper horror was lost. Kubrick'sThe Shininggets under your skin and chills your bones; it stays with you, inhabits you, haunts you. And there's no place to hide...--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300267881", "0790734079", "B00005ATQA", "6302038308", "6300182770", "B0009RRUKW", "0783235607", "0783228317", "B00000J2KZ", "B00004RNAC", "0790736039", "B00023NRSM", "6304508611", "6300182878", "6302921058", "6304509154", "0783216084", "6300214087", "B00004W5UA", "6301427076", "630268644X", "B000003KHS", "B000AMW2TK", "0790700506", "6300181340", "6300214753", "6302054982", "0784011923", "6305363668", "6303686796", "6305095566", "630021639X", "6302822688", "6305576173", "0783246641", "6304994540", "6303953425", "B00004U8PA", "0792158261", "0792100085", "6300213986", "6300189015", "630533577X", "6300214826", "0792846303", "6304288433", "6300147630", "0792842111", "B000007OY0", "0790741512", "6302158176", "0792846311", "6300183416", "0800103106", "B000005PFL", "6300183211", "0790733927", "6301666569", "6301871952", "0767825411", "630339406X", "6303109950", "6300216500", "6300214192", "6300262731", "6303257674", "6304214502", "630018627X", "6300214311", "1558807381", "0792839234", "0767819187", "B00005B238", "0790731975", "6303579388", "B000059HFB", "6302798450", "B00000FZCU", "6303651461", "6303566391", "6302642175", "6301971582", "6300218058", "6301094352", "6300184064", "6300181278", "6304457383", "6300214672", "6300262855", "0800125762", "6303257305"], "bought_together": ["0790734079"], "also_viewed": ["6300147630", "6300182878", "B00005ATQA", "6300189015", "6300267881", "B00023NRSM", "6300213005", "6303953425", "0307743659", "6303148352", "0790734079", "B001AQT0Z4", "6300183211", "0784011923", "B00BBND56G", "0788806270"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 268792}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0790705141", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5106FV0S4PL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Shining [VHS]"}
{"description": "Whether or not you can sympathize with its fascistic-vigilante approach to law enforcement,Dirty Harry(directed by star Clint Eastwood's longtime friend and directorial mentor, Don Siegel) is one hell of a cop thriller. The movie makes evocative use of its San Francisco locations as cop Harry Callahan (Eastwood) tracks the elusive &quot;Scorpio killer&quot; who has been terrorizing the city by the Bay. As the psychopath's trail grows hotter, Harry becomes increasingly impatient and intolerant of the frustrating obstacles (departmental red tape, individuals' civil rights) that he feels are keeping him from doing his job. A characteristically taut and tense piece of filmmaking from Siegel (Invasion of the Body Snatchers,The Shootist,Escape from Alcatraz), it also remains a fascinating slice of American pop culture. It was a big hit (followed by four sequels) that obviously reflected--or exploited--the almost obsessive or paranoid fears and frustrations many Americans felt about crime in the streets. At a time when &quot;law and order&quot; was a familiar slogan for political candidates, Harry Callahan may have represented neither, but from his point of view his job was simple: stop criminals. To him that end justified any means he deemed necessary.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790733390", "079073172X", "6300216500", "0792836510", "6300269043", "0790751216", "0792837312", "6302890721", "079284100X", "6302054982", "6304429711", "0784011923", "6302610702", "6302360978", "6300182452", "0792110188", "6300263673", "B000005PF5", "0792835077", "B0000068SI", "6303020089", "630442972X", "6300214826", "6300183211", "B000003KDG", "6301976061", "B00000J2KZ", "630118663X", "0790734079", "6303212263", "6300214060", "6301327845", "0783222955", "6300271331", "B00000K2SC", "0792842464", "B000005PJ6", "6304437315", "0792133153", "6301802330", "6304025831", "6300181405", "6302787564", "0790735423", "6303029027", "0792108868", "0790751267", "6304509154", "0790705141", "B000007OY0", "6300269639", "0800100832", "6303686796", "630281622X", "6304258984", "079284517X", "0792839234", "6303920098", "0792110285", "6305622825", "6302712009", "0790733927", "6301586026", "0800125762", "6302596092", "630018224X", "0790748169", "0792839846", "6301971809", "6303506291", "6305576173", "0783223218", "6300214540", "0783241542", "6303313345"], "bought_together": ["0790733390"], "also_viewed": ["079073172X", "B005GJTZZG", "0790737744", "0790751267", "0792836510", "630118663X", "0790733390"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 365837}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.94, "brand": "", "asin": "0790731975", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VY4VS01BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dirty Harry [VHS]"}

{"description": "A cultish horror favorite, 1962'sWhat Ever Happened to Baby Jane?will make you think twice before hungrily unveiling a covered plate of food. Bette Davis stars as Jane Hudson, a onetime child actress and singer. As an elderly woman, she wishes to revive her vaudevillian career, but she has become a grotesque caricature of her former self. Over the years as her star faded, the star of her older sister Blanche (Joan Crawford) rose, outshining the career of the has-been Baby Jane. Jane was relegated to minor roles, which she only won when Blanche demanded that she be awarded them. The film opens years after a calamitous car accident leaves Blanche in a wheelchair, with no one to care for her except the increasingly insane and sadistic Jane and their servant, Norman. Trying to punish Blanche for her years of success, Jane tortures the housebound woman, slowly trying to starve her to death, all the while attempting to recapture the fame of her youth. This dark drama also stars Victor Buono as the hefty pianist who answers Jane's ad for an accompanist, hoping to milk some money off the demented old woman. Both Buono and Davis were nominated for Oscars for their roles in this suspenseful and somewhat sick thriller that exploited well the real-life antagonism between Davis and Crawford, while at the same time rejuvenated both their careers.--Jenny Brown", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009NZ2MO", "B00027JYNK", "B00AEFYNG8", "B00027JYLM", "B0012KSUTK", "B00006RCO1", "B0008ENIAC", "B0012KSUUE", "B0002B15ZG", "B000EHQU0S", "B004H83IFU", "B00AEBB89C", "B0008ENID4", "B0087ZG7PW", "B0045HCJ94", "B0079R1KVA", "B00AEBBA7W", "B000EU1Q1I", "B0087ZG7UW", "B0000714BT", "B0008ENIKM", "B000EXDSCA", "B00003CXCF", "B000XT1P48", "B0012OX7DA", "B00466JALY", "B0008ENIDE", "B000068TPG", "B0008ENIDO", "B000XNZ7NO", "B0012Q3T5O", "B0087ZG7OI", "B005C6BGT6", "B00J2TCHP6", "B004XKVP7K", "B000EBD9T4", "B001D8W7EU", "B0008ENICU", "6305213305", "B000055XM8", "B00391466Q", "B0045HCJHG", "B00BTYU3SK", "B00003CXBZ", "B001IHJ97Y", "B0053TWVSC", "B007TYI7YQ", "B00HLT0YNG", "B001LPWGGY", "B001KXZGO6", "B00ESZZOOK", "B0002HOEQ2", "B00009NHBC", "B006FE83UE", "B00013RC7K", "B0035Q636Q", "B0009I8QHC", "B00871C09S", "B00004XPPK", "B002GSXKQA", "B0000WN0NW", "B000056HEB", "B002945DUW", "B0007US7EY", "B00009AOBI", "B00003Q433", "B002VWNIDG", "B002TSAAME", "B00004TWZH", "B005AMJ36U", "B00007G1ZL", "B00066FAOE", "B00009NHC5", "B00004TS0G", "B0008ENICA", "B0002HOERG", "B0082LUEFA", "B00074DY16", "B003V4JU1W", "B00003L9CI", "B00HZVX14O", "B00005RERS", "B005ETANC2", "B000KGGJ1I", "B007UW9W5U", "0792846443", "B0000542C7", "B000A9QK7I", "B0012KSUV8", "B000Q66Q8I", "B000JU8HBA", "B00005KHJX", "B0007R4SZY", "B000VX9WB4", "B005H8G78O", "B005H4IIAS", "B002945DUM", "B002XDR5LE", "B00AEFXX9Q", "0783230389"], "bought_together": ["B0009NZ2MO", "B00AEFYNG8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00027JYNK", "B00AEFYNG8", "B000EHQU0S", "B00006RCO1"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 154887}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0790732246", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J44QQ12RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?"}

Wayne plays a career gunfighter in the autumn of his life, trying to hang up his pistols after he discovers he's dying of cancer.  Boarding in the house of an attractive widow (Lauren Bacall) and her son (Ron Howard), Wayne's character opts for peace in his final days but is dogged by his reputation when a handful of killers seeks him out for a final fight. Howard is fine as a fatherless boy who needs the strong mentor the hero represents, and James Stewart--who costarred with Wayne in the greatMan Who Shot Liberty Valance--plays the doctor who gives the big man the bad news.

{"description": "When the theatrical release of James Cameron'sTitanicwas delayed from July to December of 1997, media pundits speculated that Cameron's $200&nbsp;million disaster epic would cause the director's downfall, signal the end of the blockbuster era, and sink Paramount Studios as quickly as the ill-fated luxury liner had sunk on that fateful night of April&nbsp;14, 1912. Some studio executives were confident, others horrified, but the clarity of hindsight turned Cameron into an Oscar-winning genius, a shrewd businessman, and one of the most successful directors in the history of motion pictures.Titanicwould surpass the $1&nbsp;billion mark in global box-office receipts (largely due to multiple viewings, the majority by teenage girls), win 11&nbsp;Academy Awards including best picture and director, produce the best-selling movie soundtrack of all time, and make a global superstar of Leonardo DiCaprio. A bona fide pop-cultural phenomenon, the film has all the ingredients of a blockbuster (romance, passion, luxury, grand scale, a snidely villain, and an epic, life-threatening crisis), but Cameron's alchemy of these ingredients proved more popular than anyone could have predicted. His stroke of genius was to combine absolute authenticity with a pair of fictional lovers whose tragic fate would draw viewers into the heart-wrenching reality of theTitanicdisaster. As starving artist Jack Dawson and soon-to-be-married socialite Rose DeWitt Bukater, DiCaprio and Kate Winslet won the hearts of viewers around the world, and their brief but never-forgotten love affair provides the humanity that Cameron needed to turnTitanicinto an emotional experience. Present-day framing scenes (featuring Gloria Stuart as the 101-year-old Rose) add additional resonance to the story, and although some viewers proved vehemently immune to Cameron's manipulations, few can deny the production's impressive achievements. Although some of the computer-generated visual effects look artificial, others--such as the sunset silhouette ofTitanicduring its first evening at sea, or the climactic splitting of the ship's sinking hull--are state-of-the-art marvels. In terms of sets and costumes alone, the film is never less than astounding. More than anything else, however, the film's overwhelming popularity speaks for itself.Titanicis an event film and a monument to Cameron's risk-taking audacity, blending the tragic irony of theTitanicdisaster with just enough narrative invention to give the historical event its fullest and most timeless dramatic impact.Titanicis an epic love story on par withGone with the Wind, and like that earlier box-office phenomenon, it's a film for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305123616", "6304117752", "6301792734", "6303215734", "B00000JS61", "6304178352", "6303396623", "6303314015", "B00003CXTF", "0769403468", "6301734734", "6302936381", "6303300480", "6305368139", "B00005RRG3", "6302610702", "0792839846", "6300207919", "B000P0J0C4", "6304546262", "B000056BRF", "6304400551", "6303101267", "630150528X", "6303637574", "B000P0J0EW", "6305126062", "6302935148", "0800199421", "6304681496", "0792116887", "6301963911", "B0000DCGT1", "B00001IVED", "6305169187", "B00006RCST", "6300216721", "630197879X", "0800113055", "076780922X", "080010367X", "0800141326", "0800184319", "6304039522", "B000066AXC"], "bought_together": ["6305123616"], "also_viewed": ["B009VQHDSQ", "6303314015", "B0074JODXU", "B00003CXTF", "B003JQZXWW", "6302787068", "6301796535", "0788812807", "0788806270", "B00005JKDQ", "6304500831", "6305229449", "6304117752", "6300213668", "6304089767", "B0000AQZYM", "079213690X", "6303049079", "6305123616", "6303402348", "6301792734", "0788812408", "B00079HZSE", "B000035Z2S", "B00000K3AN", "0788805843", "6302526574", "B0000029YC", "6303534422", "6303215734", "B0070285YE", "B00008LDO9", "0783216084", "6304434340", "B00BBND56G", "0788805533", "6300183211", "6302320402", "6305750750", "B0002CHI3S", "0790748266", "6304143184", "B0000040CM", "B005X7H9SQ", "B00004RFHF", "B00005V1Z7", "6302814782", "6301572688", "B00000JS61", "B008SLUWZG", "6303257844", "B00078XGO2", "0790736039", "B0000040EJ", "B000065U6Q", "B00003CX7L", "B00000ADKZ", "6300263673", "6302178924"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 65950}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.47, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "0792151712", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21BAWEVBJ1L.jpg", "title": "Titanic [VHS]"}
{"description": "Richard Gere works in a Chicago steel mill at the turn of the century, but must flee the city after accidentally killing a man. Heading for the wheat fields of Texas, he packs up his girlfriend (Brooke Adams) and his younger sister (Linda Manz). Instead of a better life, they head straight into tragedy when a wealthy farmer (Sam Shepard) falls for Adams. Believing him to be dying and expecting to inherit a fortune, she agrees to marry him. Their plans change when Shepard fails to die and Gere takes matters into his own hands. Aesthetically flawless, this film about a romantic love triangle is diminished by the small scope of video. Originally shown in 70mm, it is an eye-catching period piece that won its cinematographer, N&eacute;stor Almendros, a 1978 Oscar. Texture and color are the unbilled characters in this tragic tale, and are just as important as the players.

{"description": "When it was released during Hollywood's golden year of 1939,The Wizard of Ozdidn't start out as the perennial classic it has since become. The film did respectable business, but it wasn't until its debut on television that this family favorite saw its popularity soar. And whileOz's TV broadcasts are now controlled by media mogul Ted Turner (who owns the rights), the advent of home video has made this lively musical a mainstay in the staple diet of great American films. Young Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland), her dog, Toto, and her three companions on the Yellow Brick Road to Oz--the Tin Man (Jack Haley), the Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr), and the Scarecrow (Ray Bolger)--have become pop-culture icons and central figures in the legacy of fantasy for children. As the Wicked Witch who covets Dorothy's enchanted ruby slippers, Margaret Hamilton has had the singular honor of scaring the wits out of children for more than six decades. The film's still as fresh, frightening, and funny as it was when first released. It may take some liberal detours from the original story by L. Frank Baum, but it's loyal to the Baum legacy while charting its own course as a spectacular film. Shot in glorious Technicolor, befitting its dynamic production design (Munchkinland alone is a psychedelic explosion of color and d&eacute;cor),The Wizard of Ozmay not appeal to every taste as the years go by, but it's required viewing for kids of all ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005F96UJ6", "B0000VCZKM", "B00E9ZATKI", "0792839749", "B0087F7VSY", "B0090XLDKY", "B002M2Z3BA", "076781326X", "B00C7JGDBW", "B000P0J09W", "B000URDCC6", "B002HK9IDQ", "B0000DZ3EN", "B000RPCK2E", "B000065V42", "B001JV5BF8", "B0000AM6IY", "B00335EQ0E", "B005NFJAZS", "B003VS0CX8", "B0000VCZKW", "0062278010", "B002NZK5SW", "B0010X744G", "B00CQRN3QI", "B0009XT8ME", "B000HT3PGU", "B006VJ1AAI", "B00005RRG7", "B008H6GHEM", "B00GVFJ5QS", "B00HVBB140", "B002VWNIAY", "B000BT970O", "B002CLBJPK", "0060293233", "B00028HBES", "B00322XV8Q", "B00EV1YZ96", "B000AJJNIG", "B00AATV0WS", "B0054OGQM8", "1495421864", "0739060821", "B00AEFXMGU", "0792833759", "B00AMSQBNK", "B000TPTCP0", "B0009X75QU", "B00ITVMMOY", "B00005RRGB", "B0017Q0SJ4", "0767836324", "B004302N2Q", "084318017X", "B001GLX6UI", "B003YBW2Y4", "1402766254", "B00019GHU2", "B00003CXCQ", "B00AMSM9CW", "B00005JG6M", "B0047QLNUY", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B00447L4JG", "0767819659", "B00000JPH6", "B002BIGCXS", "B00G5G7EXY", "B0000AK7AB", "B006FE83UE", "B002VWNIBI", "B00005JL1P", "B001ILFUDC", "0800177258", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00005RDSQ", "B00JHH1ZN8", "B0006IINYQ", "B0015NORDW", "B002GHHHNS", "B0013ND30M", "0792838408", "B001AGXEAG", "B0047CG9F2", "B00006ADD5", "B0013FSL3E", "B00079Z9VO", "B00F6SHECS", "B0008JIJ2E", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00005JN4W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HVBB140", "B005F96UJ6", "B0000VCZKM", "B00I6JOD2S"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 206236}, "asin": "0792833171", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GYW80GAJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Wizard of Oz"}

{"description": "A man calling himself Henry Faber is actually \"the Needle,\" a German spy in England bearing critical information on Allied invasion plans that he must deliver personally to the Fhrer. He's so named because of his preferred method of assassination, the stiletto. He is a coldly calculating sociopath, emotionlessly focused on the task at hand, whether the task is to signal a U-boat or to gut a witness to avoid exposure.\n\nOn his way back to Germany, a fierce storm strands him on Storm Island, occupied only by a woman named Lucy (Kate Nelligan), her disabled husband, their son, and their shepherd, Tom. A romance develops between the woman and the spy, due to an estrangement of affections between Lucy and her husband, whose accident has rendered him emotionally crippled as well.\n\nThe love affair suggests there's a sympathetic personality buried somewhere inside the Nazi spy, though he remains enigmatic. Early on, we discover that he may not enjoy the hand life has dealt him. When a courier asks him about the way he lives, and \"What else can one do?\" the Needle answers, \"One can just stop.\"\n\nLucy realizes that her lover has been lying after she discovers her husband's dead body. \"The Needle\" must get to Tom's radio in time to report to his superiors the exact location of the D-Day invasion. Lucy is the Allies' last chance. He is reluctant to harm her, but she has no such qualms and shoots him as he tries to escape in a boat. Additional footage tells of Faber's activities four years before and of David's accident, while another ending finds Lucy receiving help from British Intelligence.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005QCVP", "6303057225", "B0000040EJ", "0783240171", "6302529441", "6302700949", "6302909023", "6302238331", "6302413435", "0790743213", "0800132009", "0792837096", "6300181340", "0790733463", "6301971809", "630150528X", "6300215741", "6300185168", "6302717736", "6302529484", "6302779782", "6300216748", "630280051X", "6303451535", "6303168507", "0783221347", "079074886X", "B00024I2TK", "079284517X", "6303082866", "0783235623", "B00008R9K9"], "bought_together": ["B00005QCVP"], "also_viewed": ["B0039A9M7K", "B004CQZF8U", "0451204530", "0451215710", "0062020889", "0525953094"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 312020}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.91, "brand": "", "asin": "0792835050", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516X8HB6Y7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Eye of the Needle [VHS]"}

There she is reacquainted with Voight, an old friend who has returned from the war as a paraplegic. Lonely and disconnected from her husband, Fonda finds love, and fulfilling sex, with Voight. The sex scenes, very steamy for the time, are still provocative. This mature love story is about expanding your horizons, and is both moving and thoughtful.

{"description": "In this 1942 melodrama, founded on the novel by Olivia Higgins Prouty (who also wrote the novel on whichStella Dallaswas based), Bette Davis stars as Charlotte Vale, a dowdy, repressed woman who, overwhelmed by her domineering mother, is on the verge of a nervous breakdown. She finds help at a sanitarium from a kind psychiatrist (Claude Rains), who turns her into a beautiful, confident woman. As a new person, she takes a pleasure cruise, where she meets Jerry (Paul Henreid), an architect trapped in an unhappy marriage, saddled with a troubled daughter. The two fall in love, but, of course, the romance is doomed. Yet their paths cross on occasion, and, despite their feelings, Charlotte finds satisfaction in helping Jerry's depressed child.

{"description": "\"There are angels over the streets of Berlin,\" quotes the movie poster,  but these are like no angels you've ever seen. Bundled in dark overcoats, they watch over the city with ears open to the heartbeat of the human soul, listening to the internal musings and yearnings of earthbound humans like existential detectives. In these delicate, astounding scenes we float through the thoughts of dozens Berlin citizens, from the weary and worn to the hopeful and young, as the angels record the magic moments for some heavenly record. But when Damiel (the empathic and sensitive Bruno Ganz) falls in love with an angel of another sort, the lonely trapeze artist Marion (willowy, sad-eyed Solveig Dommartin), he gives up the contemplation and observation of life to experience it himself.Wim Wenders's most purely romantic film is like poetry on celluloid, a celebration of the transient and fragile moments of being human: the warmth of a cup of coffee on a cold day, the embrace of a friend, the touch of a lover, the rapture of love. Opening with an angel's-eye view of Berlin in silvery black and white (delicately captured by the great cinematographer Henri Alekan, who photographed Jean Cocteau'sBeauty and the Beast40 years earlier), it transforms into a gauzy color world when Damiel \"crosses over\" by sheer will. Peter Falk plays himself as a fallen angel with a special sensitivity for celestial visitors (\"I can't see you, but I know you're there,\" he proclaims), and Otto Sander, whose smiling eyes brighten a face etched by eons of waiting and watching, is Damiel's partner. Wenders made a sequel in 1993,Faraway, So Close, and Hollywood remade the film asCity of Angelswith Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303148263", "B00005U8EN", "B000021Y77"], "bought_together": ["6303148263"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 285475}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.5, "brand": "", "asin": "079284551X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41WM4GQN9YL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wings of Desire [VHS]"}

{"description": "Writer-director William Sachs, the genius who brought the worldGalaxina, reveals another side of his vision withThe Incredible Melting Man, one of the most disgusting stories ever brought to the screen. Like all the great universal myths that touch our hearts, the story itself is a simple one: astronaut Steve is exploring Saturn's rings when he gets a fatal dose of radiation. He promptly starts melting and must eat human flesh to survive. Never you mind why, he just does. It's up to Dr. Ted Nelson to track Steve down, which he must do single-handedly because it's a Government Secret. Ted does a little bit of searching and a whole lot of eating and talking, and all the while Steve gets madder and messier.  There is much to recommendThe Incredible Melting Man, not the least  being a range and caliber of acting normally only found in the porn industry.  You can also enjoy an enormous 1970s wall hanging and plenty o' fuzz-tone guitar  in the soundtrack. Sharp-eyed fans of women-in-prison movies will be pleased to  see an appearance byCaged Heatstar Rainbeaux Smith in a disturbing  reminder of just how far gender relations had yet to go in the early '70s, and  director Jonathan Demme also makes an all-too-brief appearance as Matt. It's a  pity he doesn't stick around a few minutes to lend a restraining hand when, in  the film's most terrifying sequence, Matt's girlfriend Nell stops to take an  Acting Moment. The film's real  star, of course, is the makeup, by Oscar-winner Rick Baker. Baker created four different phases of melting and other assorted oozing and sloughing effects--a true triumph of vileness. With its howlingly bad ad-libbing, astonishing '70s d&eacute;cor, and unusually mushy body parts,The Incredible Melting Manis guaranteed to liven up any fondue party.--Ali  Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00D9EJFV4", "6304147074", "6302485053", "6300147630"], "also_viewed": ["B0001611DI", "0792846680", "6302863724", "0792846753"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 412322}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.9, "brand": "MGM", "asin": "0792846702", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51999FSJR4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Incredible Melting Man [VHS]"}

{"description": "The Salem witch hunts are given a new and nasty perspective when a vengeful teenage girl uses superstition and repression to her advantage, creating a killing machine that becomes a force unto itself. Pulsating with seductive energy, this provocative drama is as visually arresting as it is intellectually engrossing. Arthur Miller based his classic 1953 play on the actual Salem witch trials of 1692, creating what has since become a durable fixture of school drama courses. It may look like a historical drama, but Miller also meant the work as a parable for the misery created by the McCarthy anti-Communist hearings of the 1950s. This searing version of his drama delves into matters of conscience with concise accuracy and emotional honesty. Three passionate cheers for Miller, director Nicholas Hytner, and costars Daniel Day-Lewis and Winona Ryder.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["0822003376"], "also_viewed": ["B00009RDGF"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 284724}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.95, "brand": "", "asin": "079394144X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51M5S7KCB0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Crucible [VHS]"}
{"description": "Here's a model for adapting a novel into a movie. The bestseller by James Jones, a frank and hard-hitting look at military life, could not possibly be made into a film in 1953 without considerably altering its length and bold subject matter. Yet screenwriter Daniel Taradash and director Fred Zinnemann (both of whom won Oscars for their work) pared it down and cleaned it up, without losing the essential texture of Jones's tapestry. The setting is an army base in Hawaii in 1941. Montgomery Clift, in a superb performance, plays a bugler who refuses to fight for the company boxing team; he has reasons for giving up the sport. His refusal results in harsh treatment from the company commander, whose bored wife (Deborah Kerr) is having an affair with the tough-but-fair sergeant (Burt Lancaster). You remember--the scene with the two of them embracing on the beach, as the surf crashes in. The supporting players are as good as the leads: Frank Sinatra and Donna Reed won Oscars (and Sinatra revitalized his entire career), and Ernest Borgnine entered the gallery of all-time movie villains, as the stockade sergeant who makes Sinatra miserable. Zinnemann's work is efficient but also evocative, capturing the time and place beautifully, the tropical breezes as well as the lazy prewar indulgence. This one is deservedly a classic.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305261296", "6302226899", "6302413435", "6305123616", "079284517X", "6302413400", "0783221347", "0783222955", "B000005PPB", "0800113055", "6301586026", "6303057225", "6300215644", "6303402070", "6300215741", "0790743159", "6301976983", "6302877873", "B0000048YM", "630150528X", "0793910323", "6302000661", "1558807780", "6300216012", "6302120624", "6302842263", "6302700949", "6302360978", "6300246965", "6304111398", "6301628454", "6304291698", "0800132009", "6301578805", "6301706587", "6301975987", "6300216721", "6302593220", "6301670140", "630442972X", "0792107683", "6301670159", "6304359705", "6301955293", "6301798503", "6301976622", "6301599225", "1558808590", "B00000F13M", "6300183890", "6300267865", "0792101448", "6301797957", "6301973232", "0782008348", "6301564456", "0792110269", "6301798732", "B000M5BRX2", "6301969294", "0783235623", "6302484391", "0790743213", "6300215962", "6300147355", "630266232X", "6300182304", "6303282237", "0792841026", "0790733935", "0792837967", "6301959728", "0783236352", "6302779782", "6302640504", "B0000048YO", "6304383169", "6302238331", "6301640667", "6300214826", "6300181421", "6303029027", "6300181340", "6304429274", "0792837096", "6301973259", "6303560040", "6302753198", "6304056915", "0792837630", "6303943004", "6302797713", "0782006779", "6301798759", "6302278929", "6300246868", "630533577X", "0792837649", "6304935811", "0800100816"], "bought_together": ["6305123616"], "also_viewed": ["6304117752", "0783222955", "0783221347", "6303215734", "6304429274"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 203870}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0800100832", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4157079C8HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "From Here to Eternity [VHS]"}

{"description": "Just what the world needs, another riff on that post-Psychohorror clich&eacute;: the slasher movie. In this version, which considerably dumbs down the Lois Duncan book, the bad guy chases naughty teenagers with a hook, all the while dressed as a dark version of the Gorton's fisherman. They seem to have killed someone in a car accident while out partying, and a price must be paid. Nothing new is added to the genre, though it would be unfair not to note that this does have some scary moments. That is about all it has, because as much as this wanted to be anotherScream, it hasn't the heart or the script. It does, however, have the requisite cast of small-screen stars (includingParty of Five's Jennifer Love Hewitt and Buffy herself, Sarah Michelle Gellar) to have snagged box-office success, spawning a sequel.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767826728", "0792151712"], "bought_together": ["0767826728"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 332658}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.8, "brand": "", "asin": "0800184319", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/7107W97AXAL._SY300_.gif", "title": "I Know What You Did Last Summer [VHS]"}

{"description": "Considered by many to be the greatest B&nbsp;movie ever made, the original-release version of Orson Welles's film noir masterpieceTouch of Evilwas, ironically, never intended as a B&nbsp;movie at all--it merely suffered that fate after it was taken away from writer-director Welles, then reedited and released in 1958 as the second half of a double feature. Time and critical acclaim would eventually elevate the film to classic status (and Welles's original vision was meticulously followed for the film's 1998 restoration), but for four decades this original version stood as a testament to Welles's directorial genius. From its astonishing, miraculously choreographed opening shot (lasting over three minutes) to Marlene Dietrich's classic final line of dialogue, this sordid tale of murder and police corruption is like a valentine for the cinematic medium, with Welles as its love-struck suitor. As the corpulent cop who may be involved in a border-town murder, Welles faces opposition from a narcotics officer (Charlton Heston) whose wife (Janet Leigh) is abducted and held as the pawn in a struggle between Heston's quest for truth and Welles's control of carefully hidden secrets. The twisting plot is wildly entertaining (even though it's harder to follow in this original version), but even greater pleasure is found in the pulpy dialogue and the sheer exuberance of the dazzling directorial style.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302281849", "B001BZQMFA", "0783236352", "1558807780", "0783221347", "0782008348", "630266232X", "630347327X", "6305012792", "6302655897", "6302413400", "6302413435"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 403157}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.88, "brand": "", "asin": "1558804226", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G3Y343C4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Touch of Evil [VHS]"}

{"description": "Outside of devoted cult audiences, many Americans have yet to discover the extremely stylish, relentlessly terrifying Italian horror genre, or the films of its talented virtuoso, Dario Argento.Suspiria, part one of a still-uncompleted trilogy (the luminously emptyInfernowas the second), is considered his masterpiece by Argento devotees but also doubles as a perfect starting point for those unfamiliar with the director or his genre. The convoluted plot follows an American dancer (Jessica Harper) from her arrival at a European ballet school to her discovery that it's actually a witches coven; but, really, don't worry about that too much. Argento makes narrative subservient to technique, preferring instead to assault the senses and nervous system with mood, atmosphere, illusory gore, garish set production, a menacing camera, and perhaps the creepiest score ever created for a movie. It's essentially a series of effectively unsettling set pieces--a raging storm that Harper should have taken for an omen, and a blind man attacked by his own dog are just two examples--strung together on a skeleton structure.

{"description": "Clever and original, this horror film directed by Steve Miner (Forever Young) stars Julian Sands as a 17th century warlock who escapes the gallows and is transported--along with the witch hunter who brought him to trial (Richard E. Grant)--300 years into the future. Running  loose in contemporary Los Angeles, Sands's supernatural monster sets about reuniting the scattered portions of a Devil's Book that will reveal the true name of God and thus destroy mankind. In a great twist, the last bit of the book is in a very interesting place: the grave of Grant's character, who has enlisted the aid of a woman (Lori Singer) in a hurried effort to stop imminent disaster. Genuinely involving,Warlockis aided immeasurably by sharp performances from the equally eccentric Grant (Withnail and I) and Sands (Naked Lunch). Miner invents his way through a kind of simultaneously new and old horror tale, and the results are taut, fun, and surprising.

{"description": "You could only see his eyes behind the layers of makeup, but those expressive orbs earned John Hurt a well-deserved Oscar nomination for his moving portrayal of John Merrick, the grotesquely deformed Victorian-era man better known as The Elephant Man. Inarticulate and abused, Merrick is the virtual slave of a carnival barker (Freddie Jones) until dedicated London doctor Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins in a powerfully understated performance) rescues him from the life and offers him an existence with dignity. Anne Bancroft costars as the actress whose visit to Merrick makes him a social curiosity, with John Gielgud and Wendy Hiller as dubious hospital staffers won over by Merrick. David Lynch earned his only Oscar nominations as director and cowriter of this somber drama, which he shot in a rich black-and-white palette, a sometimes stark, sometimes dreamy visual style that at times recalls the offbeat expressionism of his first film,Eraserhead. It remains a perfect marriage between traditional Hollywood historical drama and Lynch's unique cinematic eye, a compassionate human tale delivered in a gothic vein.

{"description": "Fact and fiction intertwine in Milos Forman's colorful kaleidoscope of E.L. Doctorow's sprawling novel of turn-of-the-century America. Anchored in the true story of the murder of architect Stanford White (Norman Mailer) by Harry Thaw (Robert Joy) over the affections of his wife Evelyn Nesbit (Elizabeth McGovern), Forman weaves a portrait of early 1900s America in a tapestry of intertwining fictional tales. The primary thread involves the proud black pianist Coalhouse Walker Jr. (Howard Rollins) and his demand for justice when a racist fireman destroys his automobile, which escalates into a reign of terror by Walker and a band of revolutionaries. A secondary story involves an ambitious immigrant artist (Mandy Patinkin) whose primitive flipbooks send him on the road to creating early cinema. Centering all of these stories in one way or another is an upper-class family known simply as Father (James Olson), Mother (Mary Steenburgen), and Younger Brother (Brad Dourif). James Cagney came out of a twenty-year retirement to play the irascible Irish police commissioner, a character created for the film. Forman's biggest departure from Doctorow's novel, however, is his focus on Walker's story, cutting away the other threads to little more than asides in the final half of the picture, the primary dramatic weakness of an otherwise rich evocation of America's past. Randy Newman's lyrical score and Miroslav Ondricek's understated cinematography earned two of the film's eight Academy Awards nominations--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000064XS", "B008HUSFTS"], "also_viewed": ["0812978188"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 233302}, "asin": "6300214257", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RA7TE2MWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ragtime [VHS]"}

Joe Gillis (William Holden), a broke and cynical young screenwriter, is attempting to ditch a pair of repo men late one afternoon when he pulls off L.A.'s storied Sunset Boulevard and into the driveway of a seedy mansion belonging to Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), a forgotten silent movie luminary whose brilliant acting career withered with the coming of talkies. The demented old movie queen lives in the past, assisted by her devoted (but intimidating) butler, Max (played by Erich von Stroheim, the legendary director ofGreedand Swanson's own lost epic,Queen Kelly). Norma dreams of making a comeback in a remake ofSalometo be directed by her old colleague Cecil B. DeMille (as himself), and Joe becomes her literary and romantic gigolo.Sunset Blvd.is one of those great movies that has become a part of popular culture (the line \"All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up,\" has entered the language)--but it's no relic.

{"description": "Maybe it doesn't quite live up to its sterling reputation, and maybe the leading man and director were slightly miscast. But who cares?Roman Holidayis the film that brought Audrey Hepburn to prominence, and the world movie audience went weak at the knees. The endlessly charming Hepburn had her first starring role in this sweet romance, playing a European princess on an official tour through Rome. Frustrated by her lack of connection to the real world, she slips away from her protective handlers and goes on a spree, aided by a tough-guy news reporter (Gregory Peck). Director William Wyler, more at home with such heavy-going, Oscar-winning classics asThe Best Years of Our LivesandBen- Hur, doesn't always keep the champagne bubbles afloat, and the Peck role would have fit Cary Grant like a silk glove. But the film is great fun, the location shooting is irresistible, and Hepburn embodies an image of chic style that would rule for the rest of the fifties. No coincidence: she won an Oscar, and so did veteran costume designer Edith Head.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300215814", "6300215741", "0793910323", "6300215644", "6300215598", "6305282927", "6304178352", "0790743213", "0792840836", "6301586026", "B000059HH1", "6303215734", "155880997X", "6300183513", "079212569X", "6301798503", "6300207919", "B00005ALP2", "079284517X", "6302800420", "0792133153", "B00000F6D1", "6302878527", "6304457383", "0792840844", "630150528X", "630233683X", "6301670140", "0782006779", "0792837630", "6300181405", "0792837096", "6303631851", "630197736X", "6305123616", "B00000F13T", "6301976932", "6301670159", "6303560040", "0792837533", "6301969316", "B000IG9Q4W"], "bought_together": ["6300215814"], "also_viewed": ["6304178352", "6300215814", "6300215598", "B00005ALP2", "0800103106", "6305123616", "0792839846", "B00AEFXLBQ", "B002HK9IDQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 230424}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.98, "brand": "", "asin": "6300215717", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R49Q1Y62L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Roman Holiday [VHS]"}

Particularly if you add in Albert Finney as Christie's delightfully persnickety sleuth, Hercule Poirot. Someone has knocked off nasty Richard Widmark on this train trip and, to Poirot's puzzlement, everyone seems to have a motive--just the setup for a terrific whodunit.

{"description": "InParents, director Bob Balaban deconstructs ourFather Knows Bestperception of '50s suburbia, skewing it via moody cinematography and Angelo Badalamenti's sinister score. Ten-year-old Michael Lamele (Bryan Madorsky) thinks his parents (Randy Quaid and Mary Beth Hurt) are cannibals.  His constant fear of his folks and their supposedly evil doings begin to warp his view of the world, and he starts seeing a social worker to confront his problems. Are they merely childhood fears intensified by an overactive imagination, or do Michael's parents really crave human flesh? Much in the way that David Lynch approached the sinister underside of small-town America inWild at Heart, so too does Balaban challenge our notion of the 'burbs as an escape from the harsh reality of the city. If anything, Michael's parents show their true colors once they become wrapped up in the materialistic, socially predatory world of suburban life. Vastly underappreciated, Balaban'sParentsis one of those rare modern horror films that uses psychology to freak you out rather than tossing buckets of blood at you (although there are a few in the film, given its theme).

In this absolutely terrific 1937 gem, a Manhattan boarding house for aspiring actresses houses an amazing roster of golden-era performers--some of whom, like their characters, were just breaking in.

The sassy comedy and sober life lessons are wonderfully mixed by the underrated director Gregory La Cava (My Man Godfrey), who captures the brashness of '30s female chatter in a much pleasanter way than the more famousThe Women.

{"description": "Part mystery, part wartime polemic,Lifeboatfinds director Alfred Hitchcock tackling a cinematic challenge that foreshadows the self-imposed handicaps ofRopeandRear Window. As with those subsequent features, Hitchcock confines his action and characters to a single set, in this instance the lone surviving lifeboat from an Allied freighter sunk by a German U-boat in the North Atlantic. A less confident, ingenious filmmaker might have opened up John Steinbeck's dialogue-driven character study beyond the battered boat and its cargo of survivors, but Hitchcock instead revels in his predicament to exploit the enforced intimacy between his characters.Indeed, we never actually see the doomed freighter--the smoking ship's funnel beneath the credits simply sinks beneath the waves, and we're plunged into the escalating tensions between those who gradually find their way to the boat, a band of eight English and American passengers and crew, plus a German sailor (Walter Slezak) rescued from the U-boat, itself destroyed by the freighter's deck gun. Heading the cast and inevitably commanding their and our attention is the cello-voiced Tallulah Bankhead as Connie Porter, a cynical, sophisticated writer whose priorities seem to be hanging onto her mink and keeping her lipstick fresh. Gradually, the others find Porter and her lifeboat, forming a temporary community that inevitably suggests a careful cross section of archetypes, from wealthy industrialist (Henry Hull) to ship's boiler men (John Hodiak and William Bendix).Hitchcock juggles the interpersonal skirmishes between the boat's occupants with the mystery of their German prisoner, which itself becomes a meditation on the fine line between nationalism and morality, a line that Slezak walks delicately until his identity is resolved. Visually, Hitchcock transforms his back-lot set and its rear-projected cloudbanks into a desolate stretch of ocean, while capturing the horror of an amputation through an economical set of images culminating in an empty boot.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0045HCJ9E", "6302413435", "0783236352", "B002GSXKQA", "0790743159", "1558807780", "6301800974", "0783235623", "0769403468", "6301640667", "6301975987", "6301973232", "1558808590", "630150528X", "0800100832", "6301564456", "6302226899", "6301959728", "B000EVD38G", "B00004R67T", "6302909023", "B00005Q4GY", "6304457316", "0790743213", "6300246965", "6301798503", "6302360978", "0783221347", "6301797957", "6301973410", "6300183580", "6304196954", "6301798708", "B000056BRF", "6302842263", "6304359705", "0792108280", "079074886X"], "also_viewed": ["B001D8W7F4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 319371}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6301798732", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AC1NXHYzL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lifeboat (The Hitchcock Collection) [VHS]"}
{"description": "Poor Charlotte Hollis. She's been shunned by the community for decades, ever since the fateful night in 1927 when her lover was hacked apart with an axe. Her antebellum southern mansion is slated for the bulldozer, as it stands in the way of highway construction. Charlotte's only hope lies in her cousin Miriam (Olivia de Havilland), coming down from up north to help settle things. Miriam, however, has other designs. Together with her boyfriend Drew (Joseph Cotten), she embarks on a scheme to systematically drive Charlotte out of her mind (not a great leap) and get her mitts on the family fortune. From there, things only get more complicated.Charlotteputs the \"gothic\" in southern gothic, as a great showcase for completely bizarre, overwrought, and out-of-control performances from all involved. Agnes Moorehead plays Charlotte's loyal, disheveled housekeeper to the hilt, with an odd inflection that calls to mind Amos and Andy more than southern gentility. As the drunken, conniving Dr. Drew, Cotten's accent is indeterminate at times, and seems to come and go. As great as the supporting players are, though, the crown goes to Bette Davis as the shrieking Charlotte, a portrait of isolation and decay stuck in a world of  tragic delusions inside her crumbling mansion. De Havilland is a close second as the scheming Miriam; the scene where she slaps the holy snot out of a hysterical Charlotte is itself worth the price of admission. Mary Astor (in her last role) and Cecil Kellaway (as a kindly Lloyd's of London adjuster) put in the only performances with any restraint, acting as counterweights for the rest of the cast. Besides, you'll never get another chance to see Joseph Cotten playing the harpsichord and  singing, or caked in mud and lily pads! With Robert Aldrich's claustrophobic  direction,Charlotteis as Southern as a field of kudzu, and as subdued  as a train wreck.--Jerry Renshaw", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304359721", "B00004TX2C", "B008BFSMBA", "0790733935", "6304152442", "B000003KE0", "1558807780", "0792839846", "6301797957", "630196912X", "6301798503", "6300988767", "6304359705", "6300215644", "0792107683", "6301973410", "6301975987", "6302150620", "6304046006", "0800100832", "6302484405", "6303333079"], "bought_together": ["6304359721", "B00004TX2C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 328827}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 16.48, "brand": "", "asin": "6301798562", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BEC6C1CGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte [VHS]"}
{"description": "AfterBirth of a Nation, what do you do for an encore, especially after said film has branded you a racist? D.W. Griffith, the silent era's \"king of the world,\" mounted this melodramatic spectacle of \"Love's Struggle Throughout the Ages,\" four stories that illustrate \"how hatred and intolerance have battled against love and charity.\" Critic Heywood Broun, upon the film's release, probably said it best: \"Quite the most marvelous thing which has been put on the screen, but as a theory of life it is trite.\" But what's on the screen is dazzling!Griffith interweaves the four parallel stories set, respectively, in the modern era (fuddy-duddy reformers and a workers' strike), Jerusalem (Christ's crucifixion), 1572 Paris (a \"hotbed\" of persecution against the Huguenots), and ancient Babylon. No collection of silent films is complete without this landmark, awe-inspiring epic, which really does boast a cast of thousands (the most memorable of which is Constance Talmadge as the spunky Mountain Girl). The fall of Babylon ranks with one of the great action set pieces, complete with racing chariots, a nifty decapitation (at the hands of Elmo Lincoln, the man who would be Tarzan), and falls from what appear to be incredible heights. The edge-of-your-seat climax to the modern story, a race against time to save an innocent young man from the electric chair, is another bravura sequence.--Donald Liebenson", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 491209}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Intolerance [VHS]", "related": {"also_viewed": ["6304383177", "B00008EY9D", "0312174918", "B007H7OQW2", "6301937112", "630197350X", "B00005J75F"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21W4KJXAYRL.jpg", "asin": "6301826558"}

{"description": "A flawed but stylish adaptation of the Chester Gould comic strip by director Warren Beatty, who also stars in the title role. The minimalist plot involves a battalion of baddies who confront the intrepid detective in a series of strung-together vignettes. Al Pacino is a comedic if overblown standout as Big Boy Caprice, and Madonna simply smolders as aggressive blonde bombshell Breathless Mahoney. It matters not that the plot is Spartan, as this dazzling eye candy is much enhanced by Stephen Sondheim's songs, including the Academy Award-winning ditty, \"Sooner or Later (I Always Get My Man).\" Beatty took his cue from the source material and concentrated on the relationships between these people, whether strained, romantic, or hateful. The performances are subtle and more amusing than you would expect from such a visually bold picture. Shot in bright, primary colors, this also won Oscars for Best Art/Set Direction and Makeup (for those inventively hideous criminals). Watch for well-known names, such as Dustin Hoffman and Dick Van Dyke, in cameo appearances and supporting roles.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302820448", "6301404440", "6305319138", "6302269431", "6303686834", "6302705517", "6300274608", "6302091632"], "bought_together": ["6302820448"], "also_viewed": ["B000059XXZ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 312472}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.87, "brand": "", "asin": "6301885732", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SR2T7ZVRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dick Tracy [VHS]"}

Spencer Tracy is the tough city editor who goes to some spectacular extremes when socialite Myrna Loy files a $5 million libel suit against his paper for calling her a notorious home-wrecker; he hires celebrated ladies' man William Powell to seduce Loy and asks his long-suffering fianc&eacute;e, Jean Harlow, to marry Powell temporarily so she can play the wronged wife when Loy and Powell are discovered together. The couples crisscross, with frenetic and not entirely unpredictable results, but much of the pleasure here lies in seeing these iconic stars being so thoroughly themselves.

{"description": "Kate plays Pat Pemberton, a college physical education teacher who excels at just about every sport there is. She's also a great athletic competitor, except when her overbearing, worrywart fianc&eacute;, Collier Weld, is around. (As Weld, William Ching does an admirable job in a thankless role.) All Pat has to do is see Collier's face on the sidelines and her golf swing loses its power; her tennis game goes haywire. It takes crooked sports manager Mike Conovan (Spencer Tracy, of course) to recognize Pat's outstanding talent. He takes her on as his most important client and handles her with the same loving care that he gives to his favorite racehorse. Naturally, Pat and Mike's relationship is destined to overstep its professional boundaries. The mutual attraction grows from the moment they meet. Watching Pat walk away, Mike comments to his partner, \"Not much meat on her, but what's there is 'cherce'.\"The film carries a powerful feminist message, especially considering that it was made in the early 1950s: Pat is undone by Collier, who would rather have her stick to being \"the little woman\" and forget about succeeding. But with Mike in her corner, Pat can have a great career. Her union with him is a true partnership; everything is, as he says, \"Five-oh, five-oh.\" In the end, he's secure enough to be comfortable as \"the man behind the woman.\" The film features terrific comic performances by Aldo Ray as a bone-headed boxer, a young Charles Bronson (before he changed his name from Buchinski) as a small-time gangster, andOur Gang's Carl \"Alfalfa\" Switzer as a high-strung bus boy.--Laura Mirsky", "related": {"also_bought": ["630290899X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 486884}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.46, "brand": "", "asin": "6301973267", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VEAMXZPFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pat &amp; Mike [VHS]"}

Henry Gordon). Flynn and Olivia de Havilland bring real tenderness to two-thirds of a romantic triangle (the other corner is the hero's brother, Patric Knowles). There's the fearsome siege of Chukoti, an unspeakable atrocity, and finally the foolhardy, inspired Charge at Balaklava. The camerawork and editing of that grand sequence never cease to astonish.

{"description": "F.W. Murnau changed the name and ghastly appearance of his villain, but this unauthorized version of Bram Stoker'sDraculacouldn't fool the Stoker estate, and it became the center of a lawsuit that almost resulted in its complete destruction. Thankfully this masterpiece survives (though in a somewhat altered form), for despite its liberties with the novel, this 1921 horror classic remains the most beautiful and resonant interpretation of Stoker. Though the plot remains essentially the same--naive real-estate clerk Thomas (Gustav von Wangenheim) is sent abroad to finalize a sale with the nocturnal Count Orlock (the hideous-looking Max Schreck), who imprisons Thomas and travels to England to claim Thomas's beautiful young wife, Ellen (Greta Schroder), as his own--the visual realization creates a very different story. Schreck plays the vampire as a grotesque demon, with his claw-like hands, bald head and sharp, bat-like ears, and he rises from his coffin with an supernatural stiffness, like a tent pole pulled upright. When the eerily empty ghost ship carrying his coffin arrives in Thomas's home port, a river of rats pours out and spreads through the town like a plague. Perhaps the most noticeable changes from the novel are the absence of Van Helsing and the richer realization of Ellen, the would-be victim, whose innate sensibility and solemn spirituality give her a spooky connection with the vampire. With his stark, symbol-laden visual scheme and sacrificial conclusion, Murnau creates a more mythic tale than any subsequent adaptation of Stoker's novel.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000067JAW", "6300183084", "6303626424", "6300183092"], "also_viewed": ["630526323X", "B00HRUQ8X4"]}, "price": 24.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 311149}, "asin": "6302194296", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VWHHY3ZJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Nosferatu [VHS]"}
{"description": "In this last go-round for the Sinbad series, Patrick Wayne plays the  legendary sailor. He is betrothed to Farah (Jayne Seymour) and seeks her hand in marriage, but her brother Kassim has been turned into a baboon by the evil Zenobia (Margaret Whiting). Before he can break Zenobia's spell, Sinbad must contend with the Minoton, a bronze statue brought back to life to do her bidding; a trio of flaming skeletons wielding swords; a 9-foot-tall troglodyte; and a saber-toothed tiger. Wayne is the film's weakest point, making a rather wooden Sinbad. Whiting's performance smells strongly of ham, but it's a brand of ham that fits the movie perfectly. As always, though, Harryhausen's work is outstanding. He instills more personality and character into his creatures in this outing, especially for Kassim and his  relationship to his sister. The prolonged battle between the troglodyte and saber-toothed tiger is a violent one, generating some real suspense. At times it's difficult to remember that it's not live action with guidance from a director. Though this is an uneven effort for the Sinbad series, it still has its moments.--Jerry Renshaw", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302182530", "6302182522", "B000KGGJ18", "6302884705", "6302751136", "6302309506", "630442972X", "630266232X", "6302736951", "6302120101", "6301977149", "0792838718", "6300181340", "6300181278", "B000007PI9", "6301971426", "630196649X"], "bought_together": ["6302182530"], "also_viewed": ["0767847431", "6302182530"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 226198}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6302309751", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DPX22KHBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger [VHS]"}

{"description": "Coming at the midpoint of his 43-film career, Effi Briest is one of Fassbinder's greatest, and most universally acclaimed, films. The DVD transfer of Effi Briest is flawless.\nTheodor Fontane's 1895 novel, about the consequences of betrayed love, was long a favorite of Fassbinder's. Effi Briest was so important to Fassbinder that he not only wrote the screenplay (which was customary), but in his extensive role as the offscreen narrator he literally became Fontane's voice, and sometimes even Effi's. Adding yet another personal layer, he also cast his own mother, Lilo Pempeit, as Effi's mother.\nAlthough I believe this is one of Fassbinder's most intricate masterpieces, as suggested below, it is also one of his most accessible films. On its most basic level, it features an engrossing melodrama about adultery, albeit one purposefully shorn of histrionics. Set in the closed, repressive Prussian society of the Bismarck era, it shows what happens when teenage Effi Briest (Hanna Schygulla, who appeared in twenty of Fassbinder's films), with prodding from her parents, makes an expedient marriage to a rising politician twice her age, Baron Geert von Instetten, and later has an affair with the charming Major Crampas. The film is marked by performances of exceptional nuance and depth; rich period detail and production design; and striking black and white cinematography. But it also works on many more levels - not only as Effi's wrenching story but as Fassbinder's profound involvement both in the social implications of her tale and in his probing of the expressive possibilities of film itself.", "price": 19.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 493302}, "asin": "6302590396", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SAEE2ZTBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Effi Briest [VHS]"}

Though the film is a mesmerizing--and quite leisurely--two and a half hours, its plot is fairly simple--young Gabrielle (Hepburn) enters the convent pledging her life to God, learns the disciplines associated with the life, receives her dream assignment of going to the Congo as a missionary nurse, and once there, is forced to face whether she is meant for the rigorous life of poverty, chastity, and most difficult of all, obedience. The film does a marvelous job of portraying the challenges of cloistered life without being either off-putting or overly romantic. And Hepburn, sometimes with only her eyes, communicates all the drive, faith, and conflict of a young woman so torn.--Anne Hurley", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300251152", "6302878527", "6300215741"], "bought_together": ["6300251152"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 287036}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.57, "brand": "", "asin": "6302636779", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51V843DC4YL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Nun's Story [VHS]"}

Often regarded as a critique of the Reagan administration's impact on the American economy, the play and film focus on a competitive group of real estate salesmen who've gone from feast to famine in a market gone cold. When an executive \"motivator\" (Alec Baldwin) demands a sales contest among the agents in the cramped office, the stakes are critically high: any agent who fails to meet his quota of sales \"leads\" (i.e., potential buyers) will lose his job. This intense ultimatum is a boon for the office superstar (Pacino), but a once-successful salesman (Lemmon) now finds himself clinging nervously to faded glory. Political and personal rivalries erupt under pressure when the other agents (Alan Arkin, Ed Harris) suspect the office manager (Kevin Spacey) of foul play. This cauldron of anxiety, tension, and sheer desperation provides fertile soil for Mamet's scathingly rich dialogue, which is like rocket fuel for some of the greatest actors of our time. Pacino won an Oscar nomination for his volatile performance, but it's Lemmon who's the standout, doing some of the best work of his distinguished career. Director James Foley shapes Mamet's play into a stylish, intensely focused film that will stand for decades as a testament to its brilliant writer and cast.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303515223", "1558807780"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 369412}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.3, "brand": "", "asin": "6302732875", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51S2V1ZW1GL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Glengarry Glen Ross [VHS]"}

Full-screen presentation ofThe ShiningandFull Metal Jacketwas also approved by Kubrick, who recomposed his original framing,  reportedly believing that those films looked best on video in the full-screen format. (In fact, the original theatrical aspect ratio ofThe Shiningwas 1.66:1, meaning that a relatively small portion of the image is lost.) Kubrick also chose mono over stereo,  believing that inconsistencies in theatrical sound systems resulted in loss of control over theatrical presentation.

While subsequent generations will look at the film and wonder whatever the fuss was about, it retains a vivid and frolicsome sensuality, before submitting to the inevitable Bergman bleakness.The film tells the story of a young couple, Harry (Lars Ekborg) and Monika (18-year-old Harriet Andersson, with whom Bergman would fall in love), stuck in lousy jobs in Stockholm. Harry is beset by parental responsibility--his mother died young and his father is ill--while Monika is fed up with her drunken, violent father. They escape in a motorboat to spend a blissful summer on an island in the archipelago. Once Monika gets pregnant and they're forced to steal food, however, the idyll concludes and they return to Stockholm, where the relationship disintegrates.

Devastated by a court order limiting his time with the children, Williams's character disguises himself as a warm, old British nanny who becomes the kids' best friend. As with Dustin Hoffman's performance inTootsie, Williams's drag act--buried under layers of latex and padding--is the show, and everything and everyone else on screen serves his sometimes frantic role. Since that's the case, it's fortunate that Williams is Williams, and his performance is terribly funny at times and exceptionally believable in those scenes where his character misses his children.

While their mother is in the hospital, 10-year-old Satsuki and 4-year-old Mei move into an old-fashioned house in the country with their professor father. At the foot of an enormous camphor tree, Mei discovers the nest of King Totoro, a giant forest spirit who resembles an enormous bunny rabbit. Mei and Satsuki learn that Totoro makes the trees grow, and when he flies over the countryside or roars in his thunderous voice, the winds blow. Totoro becomes the protector of the two sisters, watching over them when they wait for their father, and carrying them over the forests on an enchanted journey. When the children worry about their mother, Totoro sends them to visit her via a Catbus, a magical, multilegged creature with a grin the Cheshire Cat might envy.Unlike many cartoon children, Satsuki and Mei are neither smart-alecky nor cloyingly saccharine. They are credible kids: bright, energetic, silly, helpful, and occasionally impatient. Filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki makes the viewer believe the two sisters love each other in a way no American feature has ever achieved.My Neighbor Totorois enormously popular in Japan, and some of the character merchandise has begun to appear in America.

The film is essentially a linear progression of doggy violence, though director Lewis Teague (The Jewel of the Nile)--building on King's implication that we all know what it's like to be afraid of a big, scary pooch--succeeds at making the fear almost primitive for an audience.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301427076", "0790705141", "B0002O7XW2", "B00006FDCD", "B00AEBB91E", "6304113404", "B00005K3NR", "6304508611", "6300214664", "B00260HH2G", "6302814731", "6302516919", "6303514723", "6303917283", "6303212263", "6300181154", "6300214087", "1558800034", "6300214311", "6300214192", "B000006FNX"], "bought_together": ["B0002O7XW2", "B00006FDCD"], "also_viewed": ["B0002O7XW2", "B000053UIF"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 296868}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6303159966", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/416TM7DPV4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cujo"}

{"description": "The Crowset the standard for dark and violent comic-book movies (likeSpawnor director Alex Proyas's superior follow-up,Dark City), but it will forever be remembered as the film during which star Brandon Lee (son of martial arts legend Bruce Lee) was accidentally killed on the set by a loaded gun. The filmmakers were able to digitally sample what they'd captured of Lee's performance and piece together enough footage to make the movie releasable. Indeed, it is probably more fascinating for that post-production story than for the tale on the screen.The Crowis appropriately cloaked in ominous expressionistic shadows, oozing urban dread and occult menace from every dank concrete crack, but it really adds up to a simple and perfunctory tale of ritual revenge. Guided by a portentous crow (standing in for Poe's raven), Lee plays a deceased rock musician who returns from the grave to systematically torture and kill the outlandishly violent gang of hoodlums who murdered him and his fianc&eacute;e the year before.

The audio tape he happened to be recording at that moment (adding to his collection of natural sounds), however, suggests but doesn't prove that a murderous conspiracy is afoot. Trying to tease a shred of evidence from murky doubt, Travolta's character turns to a hooker (Nancy Allen) for help and stumbles into a web of evil spun by a right-wing kook (John Lithgow). De Palma's fetishistic fascination with obscured truth in a universe ruled by chance makesBlow Outone of his most operatic films.

{"description": "Terence Fisher's take on the oft-filmed Robert Louis Stevenson tale offers a clever switch in a handsome, suave, charming Hyde, like Christopher Lee's Dracula as a seductive figure of evil. Paul Massie plays Dr.&nbsp;Jekyll as a distracted intellectual under a (rather phony) beard whose personality-changing drug unleashes his repressed desires and reveals a different side not just of himself, but of his hypocritical best friend. Paul (Christopher Lee) is a smiling viper who leeches off of Jekyll while carrying on an affair with his wife, and soon becomes the smooth-faced Hyde's partner in debauchery through the nightclub underworld of Victorian England. Hyde's violent streak emerges when he targets those who have wronged his weak alter ego (including a truly brutal attack upon his wife) and in his passionate affair with the exotic snake charmer he soon makes his sexual slave. Massie is neither the intense, menacing Hyde nor the tortured Jekyll the part demands; the sides of his personality are better expressed through costars Lee as Hyde's gleefully hedonistic buddy and David Kossoff as Jekyll's conservative and caring friend. Fisher revels in the debauchery of his characters (the Jekyll story often feels like an afterthought), creating an atmosphere of decadence by suggestion and flourish, but his Hyde is a cruel, cold-blooded character, a true Hammer Studios monster behind a friendly face.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 587036}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "6303637477", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N4CYNVV2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Two Faces of Dr Jekyll [VHS]"}

Female boomers should recall yearly TV reruns of this Rodgers and Hammerstein production, featuring such delights as \"Impossible\" and \"Do I Love You Because You're Beautiful?\" It may appear a bit stark to younger viewers, but part of the charm of this 1964 network TV special, a remake of the live 1957 telecast originally built around Julie Andrews, is its utter simplicity. An extremely young Lesley Ann Warren and Stuart Damon (ofGeneral Hospitalfame) are joined by Ginger Rogers, Walter Pidgeon, and Celeste Holm. Warren is all sweetness and innocence without a hint of saccharine artificiality, while Damon is a clear-eyed romantic.

{"description": "Director Stanley Kramer's socially conscious 1961 film tackles the subject of the war crime trials arising out of World War II in an earnest and straightforward fashion, exploring the consciousness of two nations as they struggle to come to terms with the aftermath of the Holocaust. Spencer Tracy plays the American judge selected to head the tribunal that will try the suspected war criminals. As he sets about his task, he must confront the raw emotion felt by the German people, and his own notions of good and evil, right and wrong. Regarded as a classic, this stark rendering of one of the most pivotal events in the 20th century features a stellar cast including Burt Lancaster, Montgomery Clift, Marlene Dietrich, a young William Shatner, and Maximillian Schell, who won an Oscar for his role as counsel for the defense for those charged with crimes against humanity.Judgment at Nurembergis important viewing not only for the history of film, but for the history of modern times.--Robert Lane", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300215644", "B000FE5MR2", "6302413435", "6302120624", "630549388X", "0767825616", "6301661850", "0782008348", "B00005LCBP", "6304005989", "B000006GCU", "6304457391"], "also_viewed": ["B00000FZ8B", "B00000F4X2", "B00KCY3XDK", "B00005B6OY", "B00006349J", "B003LMPKSQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 264992}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 39.88, "brand": "", "asin": "630396155X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X8BB15R5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Judgment at Nuremberg [VHS]"}

{"description": "Americans love the underdog. Anytime someone is beating the odds, fighting his or her way to the top, like the Little Engine That Could, it resonates well with U.S. audiences; it's in their nature. Sylvester Stallone knew that in 1976, whenRockywas a monstrous hit and established itself in the American cultural lexicon. His low-budget tale of a young boxer who came from the slums of Philadelphia and worked his way to the championship recalls Capra characters such as Mr. Smith or John Doe as he worked his way to fame and self-respect. Like Capra's films from 30 years before,Rockypushed emotional buttons with audiences, but in a somewhat less maudlin, obvious way; it's possible to enjoyRockywithout feeling embarrassed about it, even in the cynical, postironic '90s. It ranks respectably among the best boxing pictures, such asThe Set-UporSomebody Up There Likes Me. The story paralleled Stallone's own, from a relative unknown to a star with one breakthrough picture.Rocky II(1979) carries on the story line, playing on the rivalry between Rocky Balboa and nemesis Apollo Creed, while Balboa's wife fights for her life. Mainly, though, the sequel seems like a link between the first film andRocky III, in which an aging Rocky takes on big, bad Clubber Lang (the near-forgotten Mr. T). While playing on the same emotional capital as the first movie,Rocky IIIis the high-water mark of the sequels; by the next movie, Stallone had turned into a near-self-parody of the original character.Rocky IVfinds the underdog taking on an oversized, blond Russian boxer (Dolph Lundgren) in a cold war scenario (Rocky literally wraps himself in the American flag). The series mercifully played out by 1990, as embarrassingly punch-drunk as the Rocky character himself by that point. Given the way the American pop-culture continuum seems to work, it's probably due time for the later sequels to be plucked from the compost heap of '80s flotsam and revived as high camp; the Reagan-era hyperpatriotism ofRocky IVis as dated as in junk likeRed Dawnor the dreadfulInvasion U.S.A. Still, the first three films pack a satisfying emotional wallop without giving the viewer the urge to crawl under the couch. The last two... well, use your judgment. They will soon be good for an '80s nostalgia party.--Jerry Renshaw", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000N4SHPS", "B000067CZY", "0766202771", "6302610702", "0792158261", "B00006AL1C", "6302824729", "B000005QWI", "6301792734", "6303909884", "6300183211", "B0000A36J1", "B0001VL30O", "6303953425", "B00000490M", "B000065U6Q", "0784011923", "B000006FKX", "6303824382", "0790734516", "6303651461", "0790705141", "B000007PI9", "6301589025", "6302816580", "6301520106", "0800198395"], "bought_together": ["B000N4SHPS"], "also_viewed": ["B0006GAO5Y", "B00HF98SJY", "6302610702", "B00006AL1C", "6301792734", "6304007523", "B000059Z8K", "5554454593", "6302822688", "B0000039LV", "6300213005", "0780627032", "B00BBND56G", "0792158261", "B0065AW3TA", "B000067CZY", "0792152808", "B000005PFL", "B002GSXKN8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 289290}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6304007647", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513RKAM629L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rocky Gift Set [VHS]"}

{"description": "Having developed his skill as a master of contemporary crime drama, writer-director Michael Mann displayed every aspect of that mastery in this intelligent, character-driven thriller from 1995, which also marked the first onscreen pairing of Robert De&nbsp;Niro and Al Pacino. The two great actors had played father and son in the separate time periods ofThe Godfather, Part&nbsp;II, but this was the first film in which the pair appeared together, and although their only scene together is brief, it's the riveting fulcrum of this high-tech cops-and-robbers scenario. De&nbsp;Niro plays a master thief with highly skilled partners (Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore) whose latest heist draws the attention of Pacino, playing a seasoned Los Angeles detective whose investigation reveals that cop and criminal lead similar lives. Both are so devoted to their professions that their personal lives are a disaster. Pacino's with a wife (Diane Venora) who cheats to avoid the reality of their desolate marriage; De&nbsp;Niro pays the price for a life with no outside connections; and Kilmer's wife (Ashley Judd) has all but given up hope that her husband will quit his criminal career. These are men obsessed, and as De&nbsp;Niro and Pacino know, they'll both do whatever's necessary to bring the other down. Mann's brilliant screenplay explores these personal obsessions and sacrifices with absorbing insight, and the tension mounts with some of the most riveting action sequences ever filmed--most notably a daylight siege that turns downtown Los Angeles into a virtual war zone of automatic gunfire. At nearly three hours, the film qualifies as a kind of intimate epic, certain to leave some viewers impatiently waiting for more action, but it's all part of Mann's compelling strategy.Heatis a true rarity: a crime thriller with equal measures of intense excitement and dramatic depth, giving De&nbsp;Niro and Pacino a prime showcase for their finely matched talents.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000003KHS", "6300183211", "B00000IO4G", "630018627X", "6303421563", "B00000JGEI", "6302415853", "630018403X", "0800199421", "6304258984", "0784011923", "6304259131", "6302482712", "6303953425", "B00007CVYA", "0783223218", "6300214540", "6302054982", "0790731274", "B00000ILE6", "0792147618", "079073799X", "6301208773", "6301888901", "0790701251", "0792133153", "6302378648", "6302282535", "6305718792", "6304414099", "6303696813", "0790748169", "B0002ZDVFE", "B000077VT7", "6303269834", "6302516919", "630428649X", "B00008R9K9", "6303036570", "6302814782", "0792116887", "0792158261", "0790705141", "6304508611", "6301071379", "B00005Q4GY", "076783819X", "6300214567", "6303020089", "6303383300", "6302945089", "B0002GTWOM", "B00003CXE6", "0792841778", "6301797930", "0800116917", "0800179552", "B0000040EJ", "B00005A7VC", "6300182878"], "also_viewed": ["B000003KHS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 286071}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.98, "brand": "", "asin": "6304214502", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4160ZFH45VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Heat [VHS]"}
{"description": "Vincent Price gives an atypically restrained performance as the sole survivor of a worldwide plague that revives its victims as bloodthirsty vampires. During the day, he canvasses his abandoned hometown, tracking down and stalking his former friends and neighbors, always making sure to return before nightfall, when the dead rise to assault his fortified house. Hope arrives in the form of an apparently normal young woman (Franca Bettoia), but her agenda proves to be even more sinister than that of the vampires.Based on the 1954 novel by coscripter Matheson (whose displeasure with the final product spurred the use of a pseudonym), this Italian-made production is best known for its influence on George Romero'sNight of the Living Dead. The similarities between the two films go beyond the presence of shuffling zombies and housebound heroes; both feature taboo-breaking scenes of interfamilial murder, and both end on bleak, dystopian notes. WhileThe Last Man on Earthlacks the political and darkly satirical shadings (and graphic gore) that makeNight of the Living Deada more memorable experience, the combination of Bava-esque Gothic atmosphere and bleak, documentary-style camerawork by directors Ragona and Salkow (the brother of Price's agent Lester Salkow) lend themselves to moments of pure frisson that compare laudably to Romero's film.  Matheson's novel also provided the source material for the awkward 1971 Charlton Heston vehicleThe Omega Man. A planned third version, helmed by Ridley Scott and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, was shut down in its earliest stages due to skyrocketing budget costs.--Paul Gaita", "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 751347}, "asin": "6304277385", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/7114X6M9A7L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Last Man on Earth [VHS]"}
{"description": "Romance at its most anti-romantic--that is the Billy Wilder stamp of genius, and this Best Picture Academy Award winner from 1960 is no exception. Set in a decidedly unsavory world of corporate climbing and philandering, the great filmmaker's trenchant, witty satire-melodrama takes the office politics of a corporation and plays them out in the apartment of lonely clerk C.C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon). By lending out his digs to the higher-ups for nightly extramarital flings with their secretaries, Baxter has managed to ascend the business ladder faster than even he imagined. The story turns even uglier, though, when Baxter's crush on the building's melancholy elevator operator (Shirley MacLaine) runs up against her long-standing affair with the big boss (a superbly smarmy Fred MacMurray). The situation comes to a head when she tries to commit suicide in Baxter's apartment. Not the happiest or cleanest of scenarios, and one that earned the famously caustic and cynically humored Wilder his share of outraged responses, but looking at it now, it is a funny, startlingly clear-eyed vision of urban emptiness and is unfailingly understanding of the crazy decisions our hearts sometimes make.

{"description": "Disney's 1959 animated effort was the studio's most ambitious to date, a widescreen spectacle boasting a gorgeous waltz-filled score adapting Tchaikovsky. In the 14th century, the malevolent Maleficent (not dissimilar to the wicked Queen in Disney'sSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs) taunts a king that his infant Aurora will fatally prick her finger on a spinning wheel before sundown on her 16th birthday. This, of course, would deny her a happily-ever-after with her true love. Things almost but not quite turn out that way, thanks to the assistance of some bubbly, bumbling fairies named Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather. It's not really all that much about the title character--how interesting can someone in the middle of a long nap be, anyway? Instead, those fairies carry the day, as well as, of course, good Prince Phillip, whose battle with the malevolent Maleficent in the guise of a dragon has been co-opted by any number of animated films since. See it in its original glory here. And Malificent's castle, filled with warthogs and demonic imps in a macabre dance celebrating their evil ways, manages a certain creepy grandeur.--David Kronke", "related": {"also_bought": ["155890641X", "0788802194", "0788812408", "6302526574", "0788806270", "0788812807", "078881172X", "6302642248", "6302787068", "6302320402", "6304500831", "6303314015", "6300274268", "B000035Z2S", "6300274195", "0788805843", "6305229449", "0788803743", "6302961572", "6302178924", "6304290888", "6303983812", "6300275310", "6305940932", "B0000AQZYM", "6304089767", "6305319138", "0788805533", "6304400551", "6304978286", "6304100507", "6302158095", "B00005JKDQ", "6305326940", "6304089201", "6303929338", "6304501153", "6303534422", "B00003CXQX", "6303036813", "B00005T7H6", "6301390725", "B00003CX7L", "6304873441", "B0000524CZ", "B00000ICHA", "B00004R99N", "6304400225", "B00004R99I", "B0009SUS4Q", "6302426200", "6300274608", "0788812440", "6303122647", "B0000E32WB", "0788811002", "0788810634", "B00000JS61", "B00005RDVV", "6303939015", "B00016JF2W", "B00005RDWC", "0790748266", "B000JBWWRO", "6304117752", "1558906150", "B00003CXHR", "B000035Z46", "6303486894", "0788812181", "6303392350", "B003H9M1Q2", "6303148387", "6302484359", "1558901892", "B00005JL95", "B00003CXQ6", "6301948106", "6305177473", "0788809806", "B00007AJLB", "B00003CWPW", "6305942285", "B000B8I8T6", "B00335EQ0E", "6301991311", "B0002YLCHE", "630460016X", "0788810448", "B00004REYY", "B003ZHVJGO", "B000063V8N", "078880720X", "B00004R99O", "B00005JKX3", "6300276554", "1558906630", "B000009CTR", "B00005RRG3"], "bought_together": ["155890641X", "0788802194"], "also_viewed": ["155890641X", "0788802194", "6302526574", "0788806270", "078881172X", "0788812408", "6300274268", "6302787068", "6304500831", "0788812807", "6302320402", "6303314015", "0788805843", "6302642248", "6302178924", "6302961572", "6305319138", "6303983812", "6300274195", "6305229449", "B000035Z2S", "6304089767", "B0000AQZYM", "6304978286", "0788805533", "6303929338", "6304290888", "6305940932", "6304400551", "6303534422", "6300275310", "6304100507", "6304089201", "6302158095", "B00005JKDQ", "B001DXF9FE", "B00003CXCQ", "B0007KTBIU", "6305326940", "B00004R99N", "6304501153", "6304400225", "6302426200", "6303036813", "B00003CXQX", "6300274608", "B0000E32WB", "B00003CXHR", "B00000ICHA", "0788811002", "B00005JL95", "B003ZHVJGO", "B00005RDVV", "B0000022WA", "0788812440", "1558906150", "B00003CX7L", "B0000524CZ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 50797}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.49, "brand": "Walt Disney Home Video", "asin": "6304401132", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y7WQST4JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sleeping Beauty (Fully Restored Limited Edition) (Walt Disney's Masterpiece)  [VHS]"}
{"description": "An uneven script is the flaw of this social satire set in America's heartland. It deals with an unrepentant junkie, played with unexpected finesse by Laura Dern. Pregnant for the umpteenth time and informed by a judge he may overlook felony charges if she aborts the pregnancy, the stoned Ruth Stoops is claimed as a dazed spokesperson by both sides of the controversial abortion issue. This has a lot to say about the abuse and influence of the media The black, black humor is subtle and intelligent and quite often works in the hands of the strong supporting cast. However, the script occasionally lurches into depressing territory, throwing off the balance. Still, this raises interesting issues and Dern's performance is very powerful. Ruth is flawed and prickly, but Dern brings her to life by imbuing her with interesting personality tics.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 503220}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.84, "brand": "", "asin": "6304438192", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71PW17WJSVL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Citizen Ruth [VHS]"}

{"description": "An underrated actor, Sinbad is very good in this comedy-drama about a Secret Service agent who gets the thankless detail of guarding the president's bratty son. In time, the two become touchingly close, with Sinbad's character providing the kind of surrogate fathering the boy's ultra-busy dad can't give. The plot takes an inevitable turn toward greater drama when the young man is kidnapped, but director David Mickey Evans handles the whole thing very well, and the resolution makes for fairly satisfying action. But Sinbad's presence is an agreeably warm one--though he is also quite funny and original in early sequences when the prez's son is tormenting him--and makes this film surprisingly watchable.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303409997", "6303925235", "6304089767", "6303314015", "6303486754", "6304434340", "6304290888", "6303315305", "6302426200", "0788812181", "6303039456", "078880782X", "630493825X", "6303929567", "630179513X", "6304501676", "6303929583", "6304340648", "6304773285", "6303929575", "6304100507", "B000035Z46", "630339406X", "079072880X", "6303925243", "6304873441", "0788812424", "B00005JKX3", "6303804357", "6305177473", "6302481805", "630396267X", "6304311834", "6305319138", "6305318867", "6304826141", "B000009CTR", "6304293968", "6304279000", "1558906150", "6302945127", "6304978286", "6303347657", "0800196767", "6303168957", "B00004R99N", "B00001YX9H", "B00003CXDU"], "bought_together": ["6303409997"], "also_viewed": ["6303409997", "0788812807", "B000035Z2S", "6303925235", "6305326940", "6304089627", "6304400551", "6302787068", "B0007KTBIU", "6304311834"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 352337}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6304501668", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XT7E0JM7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "First Kid [VHS]"}
{"description": "Catherine Deneuve and David Bowie are rich, beautiful, and oh-so chic as denizens of the night. Dressed in sleek outfits and stylish sunglasses, they haunt rock & roll clubs on the prowl for young blood, whom they bring home to their impossibly luxurious mansion for a late-night snack.  Being a vampire never looked more sexy, but there's a price: Bowie starts to age so fast he wrinkles up in the waiting room of a doctor's (Susan Sarandon) office. The agelessly elegant Deneuve, evoking Delphine Seyrig's Countess Bathory fromDaughters of Darkness, is perfectly cast as a millenniums-old bloodsucker who seeks a new mate in Sarandon and seduces her in a sunlight-bathed afternoon of smooth, silky sex. Tony Scott's (Ridley's brother) directorial debut, adapted from the Whitley Strieber novel, revises the vampire myth with Egyptian inflections and removes all references to garlic and crosses and wooden stakes--these bloodsuckers can even walk around in the daylight--but the ties between blood and sex are as strong as ever. Scott's background as an award-winning commercial director is evident in every richly textured frame and his densely interwoven editing, but the moody atmosphere comes at the expense of dramatic urgency. At times the film is so languid it becomes mired in its hazy, impeccably designed visual style. In its own way,The Hungeris the perfect vampire film for the '80s, all poise and attitude and surface beauty. Sarandon talks candidly about the film in the documentaryThe Celluloid Closet.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000I1GO"], "bought_together": ["B00000I1GO"], "also_viewed": ["6302491908"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 278584}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6304509103", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51793HKSJ8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hunger [VHS]"}
{"description": "For fans and newcomers, this boxed set holds a great collection, including all four great movies. The first in the series,Batman(1989), and arguably the best of the four movies, exudes the moodiness of the Dark Knight's character. Tim Burton's direction and Michael Keaton's rendition of Batman are an electrifying combo. Together they capture the sinister atmosphere of Gotham City and Batman's darkness. Jack Nicholson as the fiendish Joker and Kim Basinger as the resourceful and gorgeous Vicki Vale lend their charm. Three years later, in 1992, Burton and Keaton reunited forBatman Returns. This time our pointy-eared hero has to combat two villains: Danny DeVito as the disturbed and freaky Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman. InBatman Forever(1995), Joel Schumacher gave his direction to the story with Val Kilmer under the cape. Kilmer keeps the moodiness but adds a little panache to his rendition. His archenemies this time are the Riddler (Jim Carrey) and Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones). Luckily, he enlists the help of the Boy Wonder, Robin (Chris O'Donnell). The final movie in the series,Batman & Robin, is great eye candy, and this time Schumacher returns with George Clooney as the leading man and Chris O'Donnell again as Robin. Together Batman and Robin battle the icy Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger), with a little help from Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone). Delve into the Gotham City world with the Dark Knight to protect you, and don't forget to make lots of popcorn for this Batman marathon.--Samantha Allen Storey", "related": {"bought_together": ["B009JBWOU0"], "also_viewed": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B0039208JE", "B004LWZWGK", "B0039208QM", "B00A7AN2SK", "B001OST0LW", "B00F4FFO8E", "6304443064", "B000006FYP", "B001OST0M6", "B000AQOHNA", "B0016MOWOQ", "B001GZ6QEC", "B000059XXZ", "B008UZBHYU", "B001DJLD2G", "B000059XY5", "B000PC6A3E", "B008EXAJM4", "B00F9D00SU", "B00IO8VMB6", "B000P6XQ50", "B00IGVJGZK", "B000059Z8K", "B002GSXKP6", "B0007WFX62", "B003PIUIJ2", "B00H15LR3Q", "B0006L0LOS", "B001CC7PKS", "B0006A9FKA", "B00H14U45Y", "B00005LIRF", "B000IJ79VQ", "B00EAPMGIU", "B0054OGQOQ", "B00KE3B8HC", "B00B5AETMO", "0790749068", "B0060FXDCG", "B0057R5XRG", "B007D5E7C2", "B004ZJZQ1A", "B00H15PSWW", "B00IO9G4HW", "B00H15B6RS", "B000A9QKL4", "B00AEFXVCU", "B008MIMWOO", "B004L9GM3A", "B003KV3E3G", "B000U1ZV8K", "B002GSXKNI", "B000IJ79UW", "B00005JKCH", "B005PTYOTE", "B00177YA1K", "B000P0J0D8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 402360}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.24, "brand": "", "asin": "6304613113", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51A6THBTQFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Batman Legacy (Four Film Giftset) [VHS]"}

{"description": "Robert Towne is one of Hollywood's most celebrated screenwriters, but because his directorial efforts have been few and far between, anticipation was high when this star-powered crime story was released in 1988. Critical reaction was decidedly mixed, but there's plenty to admire in this silky, visually seductive film about a drug dealer (Mel Gibson) whose best friend from high-school (Kurt Russell) is now working for the Los Angeles sheriff's drug detail. Their personal and professional conflicts are intensified by their love for the same woman, a waitress (Michelle Pfeiffer) at the Italian restaurant they both frequent. There's a big deal going down with a drug lord (the late Raul Julia), but as it twists and turns, Towne's story is really more about personal loyalties and individual honor. And even if it doesn't quite hold together, the movie's got a fantastic look to it (courtesy of the great cinematographer Conrad Hall), and the three stars bring depth and dimension to their well-written roles.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305262268", "0783227396", "B000LP6KMQ", "B0043X1FKY", "B00000K3TU", "B002AS464Q", "B002OGMGV4", "B00013RC66", "6304602944", "B00008CMRK", "B00000JDIQ", "B0043X1FNQ", "B00015YVDG", "B000U1ZV8K", "6305310335", "B002GHHHNI", "0792844874", "0783230591", "6305428034", "B00008L3S6", "B000HC2LHG", "B002GHHHP6", "B0045HCJ8K", "6305308837", "B003AWRMA6", "B00AEBB9WI", "0767817729", "B00BTYRB3U", "B00AEFYC96", "B00AEFXIIW", "6305213283", "B00AEFXX9Q", "0783229402", "0792845811", "0767809726", "B00AEFXKZ8", "B001C47ZOW", "B00006ZXSN", "6305236569", "B00005UQ9T", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00AEFY0KW", "B000065V3E", "B00005JM8W", "B0008KLVAU", "B001UV4XRY", "B000CEV3M8", "6305657947", "B000MGBSE4", "B001NY4WYC", "B0087DFIYA", "B00AEFYW64", "B00AEBB9N2", "0800177029", "B000087F6M", "B000N4RASS", "0790730979", "B00AEBB9UK", "B0043X1FLI", "B0002V7O5G", "B002AS463W", "B000FFJYBG", "B00004Y87L", "B0045HCJG2", "B002AT8KA6", "B002NZK5UU", "B00BTYJYR6", "B0000TG95Q", "B003ASLJIQ", "B000B8GT92", "B00AEFXYJA", "B002AT8KAG", "B000FI8MPW", "0790731932", "B002AS466O", "B002NZK5R8", "B0007KZQAM", "B002NZK5RI", "B00005BCKF", "B00005JKBC", "B002NZK5Q4", "B000FO0A9W", "B0006GANOQ", "B00008L3UQ", "6304765258", "B000008LHF", "B000ENC5YW", "B000FO0AA6", "B002VWNICC", "B0009UZG3C", "B0045HCJ5S", "B002VWNID6", "B00005V5NS", "B0010YSD8Q", "6305428506", "078322740X", "B00DW5ILUG", "B000CEXEWA", "B00AEBBA2W", "6305133468"], "bought_together": ["6305262268", "B00000K3TU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002AS464Q", "6305262268", "B0043X1FLI", "B004GJYRK0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 46654}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.98, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "6304696574", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YCTKDY10L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tequila Sunrise"}

At one point during the planning of a break-in, a spy unfolds a map of their quarry's residence, explaining that the man \"lives here.\" \"He lives on that small piece of paper?\" questions one of the henchmen.

Director Stephen Sommers couldn't recognize an original idea if it swallowed him whole--which, by the way, is exactly what happens to a lot of passengers on a luxury ship that is attacked by a giant serpent-like sea creature with a voracious appetite for human flesh. Treat Williams plays the leader of a mercenary crew whose members discover the ravaged ship and wage war on the creature; Famke Janssen joins him as an onboard thief and con artist who just happens to be highly skilled with automatic weapons. Of course, the action grows more intense as the body count rises and along the way the monster is gradually revealed in all of its gruesome glory.

She can't stand him, and he just wants to get to L.A., where a sexy \"sure thing\" is waiting to greet him with open arms. It's not hard to predict where this sweetly old-fashioned romantic comedy is going to end up, but along the way there are many pleasures to be had. Director Rob Reiner, in his second feature (afterThis Is Spinal Tap), has a nice eye for the kitschy flotsam found along the American highway, and his identification with the college kids doesn't condescend to them one bit. The movie helped make a star of John Cusack, who gives a delightfully spritzy performance--kind of a precursor to his similarly energetic, likable turn inSay Anything.

{"description": "Audrey Hepburn is the delightful young Sabrina, the daughter of a chauffeur who is hopelessly in love with David Larrabee (William Holden), the playboy younger son in the rich Long Island household her father works for. In order to help her forget her woes, Sabrina is shipped off to cooking school in Paris. While there, she befriends a baron who provides a bit of culture--and the encouragement to snip off her childlike ponytail. Upon her return to New York, Sabrina is transformed into a sophisticated woman, and David is entranced by her. However, his older brother Linus (Humphrey Bogart) has arranged David's marriage to Elizabeth Tyson in order to seal a business merger and thus must steer David away from Sabrina. To do this, Linus takes on the task of wooing her for himself. Full of great dialogue (\"A woman happy in love, she burns the souffl&eacute;; a woman unhappy in love, she forgets to turn on the oven\") and wonderful performances, this film is a romantic masterpiece.

{"description": "A lovely, liltingsoundtrackof samba and bossa nova melodies gently guides this charming movie about Erin (Hope Davis), a young nurse adrift in her life. When her boyfriend, a hyperactive political activist played by the amazing Philip Seymour Hoffman (Boogie Nights,Happiness), leaves her, Erin struggles to find serenity on her own. Meanwhile, her mother schemes to find her a new boyfriend by placing a personal ad for Erin without her knowledge.Next Stop Wonderlandjuxtaposes this with the story of Alan (Alan Gelfant), a plumber struggling to get a degree as a marine biologist. The movie weaves all sorts of hints about fate and destiny, so it's no surprise at the end when Erin and Alan meet--but the fun is in getting there. In addition to the well-drawn characters and sharp, clever writing (the sequence of personal-ad dates that Erin goes on is both funny and painful), the movie is full of visual grace notes. For example, while at a bar, Alan spills a drink on a newspaper; the wet newsprint becomes translucent and reveals a photo of Erin that was taken at an aquarium fundraiser and printed in the society page. But before Alan even sees it, his friends scoop up the wet paper and throw it away. These moments have a casual, tossed-off air that evokes a lightly mystical sense of how our lives float on a thousand invisible coincidences. More than anything else, the movie spotlights Hope Davis's intelligence and quiet soulfulness. This wonderful actress has been appearing in small roles in Hollywood features (Arlington Road,Mumford) that don't do her justice;Next Stop Wonderlandlets her glow.--Bret Fetzer", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 462433}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6305240671", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F7E4W7CBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Next Stop Wonderland [VHS]"}

After he loses his post-grad nest egg to a weird Russian kingpin (John Malkovich)--and also loses his disgusted girlfriend (Gretchen Mol) in the process--Damon's character turns to an unreliable old buddy (Edward Norton) for a dangerous game of sharking wherever there happens to be a game underway: frat boys, cops, bad dudes, you name it. Norton appears to be living out every young actor's fantasy of re-creating Robert De Niro's prototypical head case in Martin Scorsese'sMean Streets, and while his performance is burdened by obvious quotation marks, his estimable talent still shines through. Damon's charm and intelligence bring some oomph to the curiously flat proceedings, and while his hushed, soul-bearing scenes with Martin Landau (as a law professor who takes a shine to the kid) seem gratuitous, they're still nice to watch. Behind all this is director John Dahl (Red Rock West), who is not exactly at the top of his game here but who brings his distinctive toughness to the crime-noir tone.--Tom Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 343634}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.18, "brand": "", "asin": "6305240655", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51565J9D9ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rounders [VHS]"}
{"description": "Robert Bolt's successful play was not considered a hot commercial property by Columbia Pictures--a period piece about a moral issue without a star, without even a love story. Perhaps that's why Columbia left director Fred Zinnemann alone to makeA Man for All Seasons, as long as he stuck to a relatively small budget. The results took everyone by surprise, as the talky morality play became a box-office hit and collected the top Oscars for 1966. At the play's heart is the standoff between King Henry VIII (Robert Shaw, in young lion form) and Sir Thomas More (Paul Scofield, in an Oscar-winning performance). Henry wants More's official approval of divorce, but More's strict ethical and religious code will not let him waffle. More's rectitude is a source of exasperation to Cardinal Wolsey (Orson Welles in a cameo), who chides, \"If you could just see facts flat on without that horrible moral squint.\" Zinnemann's approach is all simplicity, and indeed the somewhat prosaic staging doesn't create a great deal of cinematic excitement. But the language is worth savoring, and the ethical politics are debated with all the calm and majesty of an absorbing chess game.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000056HEA", "B0057FGCRI", "B0000B1A58", "B001D5F2LI", "B0006GANX2", "B00008J2PG", "B00005AUKE", "B000BITV92", "B0006HBV3W", "B000BYA4HE", "B00AEFY6DI", "B00008LDO7", "076781326X", "B000XJD34I", "B00012FXJ0", "B00004TVUD", "0780021312", "0385496931", "B0018LX9RG", "B004FQX5A2", "B003WEAW04", "B002QXOYQK", "0679728228", "B00003CXBH", "B000FFJ83K", "B001NSLE5I", "B0000549B1", "B00005JKF6", "B000KX0IOA", "B000255LIY", "B00006ADD5", "B00005AUKB", "B000KJTGHO", "B00003CXBU", "B001GLX6TY", "B00004XPPC", "B00AEBB9FA", "B000WMFZMY", "B00005JN8Z", "B00011D1OK", "0898706254", "B00125WAXM", "B0001US8F8", "B0000633QW", "B00006RCO2", "6304907729", "B001D8W7EU", "B00GHU35HM", "B000E1MXTG", "B00AMSM9CW", "0767827775", "B00096S412", "B001GUYAZY", "B0051WTN50", "B00005MEOU", "6305257450", "B002HK9IDQ", "B000E1MXT6", "B000FL7C9G", "B0009S4IKQ", "B000MTEGSG", "B0045HCJQM", "B002VWNIBI", "B000E1ZBFY", "B00011D1OU", "B000LXWAI6", "B00005V1WY", "B00D3K357O", "B006FE83UE", "B0045HCJJY", "B0006GANY6", "B0002BO05S", "B00006RCO3", "B00GA8Z0B0", "B0010AN7Z4", "B00F6SHECS", "B001MVYUQ6", "0783240171", "B00BYCOIU6", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B004XYOQU4"], "bought_together": ["B000056HEA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000056HEA", "0679728228", "B0057FGCRI", "B000255LIY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 125062}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.37, "brand": "", "asin": "6305252564", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-2r8McJlL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Man for All Seasons"}

{"description": "Christmas is not a good time of year in the McClane family. Especially  for John McClane, who always happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. But if it weren't for the heroics of this rugged, resourceful cop, many lives would be lost and megalomaniacal terrorists with various European accents would be having their evil way. In 1988, director John McTiernan and the phenomenal hitDie Hardintroduced the world to maverick Sgt. John McClane (Bruce Willis) of the New York Police Department, and in the course of this film and two blockbuster sequels McClane was frantically saving lives, buildings, airports, schools, cities, and even his marriage from the threat of international terrorists, psychopaths, and cagey mercenaries. Now you can watch antihero McClane blast his way through all three movies. Witness his transition from a happy-go-lucky, slightly cranky cop to extremely burnt-out, partially alcoholic cop with a propensity to attract extreme violence and catastrophe. Yet the one thing that always overshadows his character flaws is his uncanny ability to spoil the schemes of stylish villains with slick names such as Hans Gruber (the nasty terrorist from the first film, played to perfection by Alan Rickman). Sit down, pop some corn, grab a bottle of Coca-Cola, and get ready to watch (in any order you please) theDie Hard Trilogy--a must for any action buff or fan of Bruce Willis, who owes his film career to the enduring appeal of these global box-office hits.--Jeremy Storey", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000VNMMR0", "B000U1ZV8K", "B00BUAEYVK", "B002GSXKNS", "B0004Z33G4", "B000MGBLSC", "B000MGBSE4", "B001VLBDD0", "B000XT1P4S", "B00005N5S5", "B0015XHP4A", "6304711891", "6304806434", "B005COLETU", "0790729695", "B00000G3PA", "B00388PK7O", "B000MGBLTQ", "B000JYW5BE", "B00004STDN", "B0006GANOQ", "B001TK80C0", "B00003CXC5", "B004EPYZUS", "B000U1ZV62", "B001DJLD1M", "B000U1ZV4Y", "B009MF5BXK", "B005CFBYW6", "B0057RCFQS", "B0054OGQM8", "B005PTYP70", "B00000ILDH", "B00004Z4WR", "B00005JA8B", "B002ZG999U", "B00070FX5U", "B0018CMJSU", "B00008G8M4", "B00JU949TK", "B008E70EES", "B0045HCJFS", "B0004Z33EG", "B00AKGG828", "B008JFURII", "B001B3LIOC", "B002GSXKP6", "B00026ZG10", "B003Q6D2B4", "B000BPL2FQ", "B009HIKAN8", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B000QUCRB4", "B0004Z33F0", "B000059H9A", "B000RJO56E", "B000HT38BM", "B000P0J06K", "B006VRRGNK", "6304712987", "0790738953", "B00016MSV2", "0767803434", "0790736411", "B003AWRMCE", "B00562I40K", "0783226888", "B00005R2IS", "B00023B1LC", "B002Z7FWBI", "B000FO0AA6", "B001E75QH0", "0767807588", "B00015YVDG", "B001TODCII", "B005LAIGLE", "0800195175", "B00005ATZT", "B00BEJL6JK", "B001AJIHC8", "B00005JKIP", "B00BLF9FOK", "B004SIP9Z6", "B004GJYRK0", "B00029NMRM", "B000VWYJ86", "B007X4ECMI", "B000F9RB9Y", "B000P0J0EM", "B0009X76XC", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B001ZGKOG8", "B000NA1WGS", "B007SPPANM", "B00AEFXKUI", "0790731924", "6305767866", "B00007AJG4", "B003ASLJNQ", "B004AZ7ZKY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000YGDNPO", "B00BUAEYVK", "B000O78KW4", "B000U1ZV8K"]}, "price": 30.25, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 225698}, "asin": "6305286566", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y1Q1JSPHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Die Hard Trilogy"}

{"description": "By now, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan have amassed such a fund of goodwill with moviegoers that any new onscreen pairing brings nearly reflexive smiles. InYou've Got Mail, the quintessential boy and girl next door repeat the tentative romantic crescendo that madeSleepless in Seattle, writer-director Nora Ephron's previous excursion with the duo, a massive hit. The prospective couple do actually meet face to face early on, butMailotherwise repeats the earlier feature's gentle, extended tease of saving its romantic resolution until the final, gauzy shot.The underlying narrative is an even more old-fashioned romantic pas de deux that is casually hooked to a newfangled device. The script, cowritten by the director and her sister Delia Ephron, updates and relocates the Ernst Lubitsch classicThe Shop Around the Cornerto contemporary Manhattan, where Joe Fox (Hanks) is a cheerfully rapacious merchant whose chain of book superstores is gobbling up smaller, more specialized shops such as the children's bookstore owned by Kathleen Kelly (Ryan). Their lives run in close parallel in the same idealized neighborhood, yet they first meet anonymously, online, where they gradually nurture a warm, even intimate correspondence. As they begin to wonder whether this e-mail flirtation might lead them to be soul mates, however, they meet and clash over their colliding business fortunes.It's no small testament to the two stars that we wind up liking and caring about them despite the inevitable (and highly manipulative) arc of the plot. Although their chemistry transcended the consciously improbable romantic premise ofSleepless, enabling director Ephron to attain a kind of amorous souffl&eacute;, this time around there's a slow leak that considerably deflates the affair. Less credulous viewers will challenge Joe's logic in prolonging the concealment of his online identity from Kathleen, and may shake their heads at Ephron's reinvention of Manhattan as a spotless, sun-dappled wonderland where everybody lives in million-dollar apartments and color coordinates their wardrobes for cocktail parties.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302936381", "6303637574", "6301796535", "B0001E7LQG", "0783241569", "0792151712", "0792116887", "0790739909", "B0000VD02E", "6301586026", "B00003CXFU", "6302820448", "6305132666", "B00004WIDB", "6301966988", "6303696813", "B0000DCGT1", "B000007OY0", "5559477621", "6301578805", "6304259131", "0782006779", "6300247236", "6302779278", "6303402348", "630394518X", "0790748169", "630150528X", "6300214222", "6303269842", "0783223218"], "bought_together": ["6302936381"], "also_viewed": ["B0000AOV4I", "6302936381", "B003BV8ICC", "B00008G7UF", "B00006ZXSK", "6302787068", "0790720434", "B00006ZXSL"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 68917}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6305368139", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513FXJJZ5ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "You've Got Mail [VHS]"}
{"description": "Okay, you knew everyone in high school was just a little different: everyone looked at you strangely, the teachers were freaky, and you never could find the right groove to fit into. What if it turned out that it was all because your school was inhabited by creepy aliens from outer space? That's the enjoyably cheesy B-premise for this fun and scary flick from the pen ofScream's Kevin Williamson, the master of the post-modern teen horror film. Directed by Robert Rodriguez (El Mariachi), it'sThe Breakfast ClubmeetsInvasion of the Body Snatchers, as six disparate students from Herrington High School band together when they discover that an alien life form is invading both the student and faculty bodies, with plans to take over the world.Each of the heroes represents a different high school type: popular babe (Jordana Brewster), picked-on geek (Elijah Wood), goth girl (Clea DuVall), sensitive jock (Shawn Hatosy), new kid in town (Laura Harris), and bad-boy rebel (Josh Hartnett). The plot isn't much--a basic kill-or-be-killed premise spiked with a healthy shot of paranoia--but Willliamson and Rodriguez do a great job of building the tension slowly but surely. The suspense set pieces are genuinely frightening, and the film pokes fun at itself without deflating its scares; Williamson is a master at shifting gears from comedy to horror quickly and adroitly. The young cast doesn't have a weak link among them (with special kudos to Wood, DuVall and heartthrob-in-the-making Hartnett), and Rodriguez gets maximum mileage from the titular faculty, which includes Jon Stewart, Piper Laurie, Salma Hayek, Bebe Neuwirth, and Robert Patrick ofTerminator&nbsp;2.

{"description": "Wes Anderson's follow-up to the quirkyBottle Rocketis a wonderfully unorthodox coming-of-age story that ranks withHarold and MaudeandThe Graduatein the pantheon of timeless cult classics. Jason Schwartzman (son of Talia Shire and nephew of Francis Coppola) stars as Max Fischer, a 15-year-old attending the prestigious Rushmore Academy on scholarship, where he's failing all of his classes but is the superstar of the school's extracurricular activities (head of the drama club, the beekeeper club, the fencing club...). Possessing boundless confidence and chutzpah, as well as an aura of authority he seems to have been born with, Max finds two unlikely soulmates in his permutations at Rushmore: industrial magnate and Rushmore alumnus Herman Blume (Bill Murray) and first-grade teacher Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams). His alliance with Blume and crush on Miss Cross, however, are thrown out of kilter by his expulsion from Rushmore, and a budding romance between the two adults that threatens Max's own designs on the lovely schoolteacher.Never stooping to sentimentality or schmaltz, Anderson and cowriter Owen Wilson have fashioned a wickedly intelligent and wildly funny tale of young adulthood that hits all the right notes in its mix of melancholy and optimism. As played by Schwartzman, Max is both immediately endearing and ferociously irritating: smarter than all the adults around him, with little sense of his shortcomings, he's an unstoppable dynamo who commands grudging respect despite his outlandish projects (including a school play about Vietnam). Murray, as the tycoon who determinedly wages war with Max for the affections of Miss Cross, is a revelation of middle-aged resignation. Disgusted with his family, his life, and himself, he's turned around by both Max's antagonism and Miss Cross's love. Williams is equally affecting as the teacher who still carries a torch for her dead husband, and the superb supporting cast also includes Seymour Cassel as Max's barber father, Brian Cox as the frustrated headmaster of Rushmore, and a hilarious Mason Gamble as Max's young charge.

{"description": "InThe Bat, top-billed Vincent Price brings his silky sinister elegance to the second remake of the hoary \"old dark house\" stage play, but the real star of the show is Agnes Moorehead as an eccentric mystery writer who decides to pull off the million-dollar bank heist and the steel-clawed killer known only as \"The Bat.\" Price's devious doctor is but one of a rogues gallery of suspects that include a Johnny-on-the-spot police detective, a chauffeur turned butler with a checkered past, and a housekeeper with echoes ofRebecca's Mrs. Danvers. Moorehead is a kick as the spirited author and makes the most of her expanded role, but fans of the early film productions (1926'sThe Batand 1930'sThe Bat Whispers, both directed by Roland West) will be less forgiving of other changes, especially writer-director Crane Wilbur's decision to draw the story out over a succession of nights. Wilbur loses the tension and claustrophobia of the originals with handsome but airy photography, more appropriate to an episode ofPerry Mason, and a rambling pace. Moorehead and Price bring a little spirit to the otherwise bland film, but not quite enough.William Castle's gimmick-laden comic thrillerHouse on Haunted Hillis not so much a horror movie as a fairground fun house come to life. Vincent Price stars as a deliciously silky millionaire married to a greedy gold digger (Carol Ohmart) who refuses to divorce him. When he turns his wife's idea for a haunted-house party into a contest--$10,000 to whoever can spend the night in \"the only truly haunted house in the world\"--it seems he may have found an alternative to divorce. Five strangers gather to test their stamina, Price hands each of them most delightfully twisted party favors ever imagined (loaded handguns, delivered in their own tiny coffins), and the spook show begins. Blood drips from the ceiling, zombielike apparitions float through rooms, severed heads and skeletons suddenly appear, and then a guest is found hanging in the stairwell. Full of screams and shocks and things that go bump in the night,House on Haunted Hillisn't particularly scary and often makes little sense, but, like a Halloween haunted house, the gag-laden spectacle of spook-show clich&eacute;s is quite entertaining and Price makes a sardonic master of ceremonies. The original theatrical presentations featured a typically outrageous Castle-engineered gimmick: Emergo, which was nothing more than a skeleton that appeared to fly out of the screen and over the audience on a guide wire.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001BSBBGC", "B00LMBURV8", "B00009PY4D", "B00000K3U3", "B00LMBURDG", "B00FMGPWNW", "B00H4KQN82", "B000FKO3VM", "B00009NHBC", "B000068TPF", "B00009PY4A", "B00FERT0PK", "B00FM4S68W", "B001BSBBNK", "B005AMJ3B0", "B00LBFFR2Y", "B00JHH22O4", "B00009PY45", "B00GNZM03G", "B0007R4SZY", "B001AD6UFA", "B000RXVNDI", "B00DI68EBK", "B00LC4PFVW", "B00DOZNGC2", "B005AMJ36U", "B00005AUK0", "B00LC4PBTS", "B00DE1LD6W", "B00DOZNI8Y", "B00K6D1R0I", "B00L22H2IS", "B00K6D1S7A", "B00H7BJ0C4", "B00DZP1C9K", "B00D9EJFV4", "B00005NKTH", "B00FOLGW3E", "B00KIZY2QA", "B00ITZXDDY", "B00L8QOZK6", "B00FGAKEEQ", "B00000ILEU", "B00KOW4BOU", "B000068TPE", "B00EU8RBZK", "B00D9EJFZA", "B000FWHW8Q", "B00HZVX14O", "B00IYJFB2G", "B008FYZHPG", "B00KIZYDCI", "B00GH6U6J6", "B0009X770E", "B000WNHTCC", "B00E0FW0M2", "B00005N5RQ", "B00005R1O7", "B000RXVND8", "B004NDJXNK", "B001BSBBMQ", "B00FJYXP36", "B00JJOY47I", "B00JV054A6", "B00JV054CO", "B0088XQDTS", "B00K1L4NBU", "B004LB5FAY", "B00DTECHWS", "B00IF0KAYS", "B004RPQSVE", "B00L6AW1K0", "B004CZZZ0O", "B0033PSH6S", "B00JJOY45U", "B00HRUQ8X4", "B000FWHW90", "B00CLIAACC", "B007HCI4SE", "B00000JQB7", "B0000694WH", "B000068TPG", "B004X63SCY", "B005ETAN7C", "B005E7SFDI", "B00EO2I6RO", "B000UDGOBG", "B00E3H3CO2", "B00EBDXVVW", "B00FL2F1O2", "B000RXVNCY", "B005ZVINFS", "B0034PWPHY", "B00005K3OF", "B004RPQSNM", "B00E21D8M0", "B00D80GMP6", "B003IRUFBG", "B002DY9KQG", "B00005LC4N"], "bought_together": ["B001BSBBGC", "B00000K3U3"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001AD6UFA", "B001BSBBGC", "B00000K3U3", "B002NZK5X2"]}, "price": 13.46, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 411447}, "asin": "6305436452", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71CQPQ131EL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Horror Classics, Vol. 3: The Bat/House on Haunted Hill"}

{"description": "One of the most endearing and intelligent romantic comedies of the '90s, the Oscar-winningShakespeare in Loveis filled with such good will, sunny romance, snappy one-liners, and devilish cleverness that it's absolutely irresistible. With tongue placed firmly in cheek, at its outset the film tracks young Will Shakespeare's overwrought battle with writer's block and the efforts of theater owner Philip Henslowe (Geoffrey Rush, in rare form) to stage Will's latest comedy,Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter. Jokey comedy, though, soon takes a backseat to ravishing romance when the beautiful Viola De Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow) disguises herself as a young man to wangle herself an audition in the all-male cast, and wins both the part of Romeo and, after much misunderstanding, the playwright's heart. Soon enough, Will's pirate comedy becomes the beautiful, tragicRomeo and Juliet, reflecting the agony and ecstasy of Will and Viola's romance--he's married and she's set to marry the slimy Lord Wessex (Colin Firth) in the near future.The way that Oscar-winning screenwriters Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard enfold their story within the parameters ofRomeo and Juliet(and evenTwelfth Night) is nothing short of brilliant--it would take a Shakespearean scholar to dissect the innumerable parallels, oft-quoted lines, plot developments, and thematic borrowings. And most amazingly, Norman and Stoppard haven't forgotten to entertain their audience in addition to riding a Shakespearean roller coaster, with director John Madden (Mrs. Brown) reigning in his huge ensemble with rollicking energy. Along the way there are small gems to be found, including Judi Dench's eight-minute, Oscar-winning turn as atrulyregal Queen Elizabeth, but the key element ofShakespeare in Love's success rests on the milky-white shoulders of its two stars. Fiennes, inexplicably overlooked at Oscar time, is a dashing, heartfelt Will, and as for Best Actress winner Paltrow, well, nothing she'd done before could have prepared viewers for how amazing she is here. Breathtakingly beautiful, fiercely intelligent, strong-willed, and lovestruck--it's a performance worthy of Shakespeare in more ways than one. By the film's end, you'll be thoroughly won over--and brushing up your Shakespeare with newfound ardor.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790734060", "6304071876"], "also_viewed": ["B00006FN65"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 406033}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.72, "brand": "", "asin": "6305470448", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q5DABSM6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Shakespeare in Love [VHS]"}
{"description": "Are you wondering just exactly who the Blair Witch was? What the Burkittsville, Maryland, legend was all about? Or what exactly fascinated student filmmaker Heather and what possibly took her, Mike, and Josh from this earth? Get all your background questions answered byCurse of the Blair Witch, a one-stop-shopping \"documentary\" originally produced for the Sci-Fi Channel as a tie-in marketing tool. Entirely fictionalized,Curse of the Blair Witchfocuses both on the past and the present, with copious info on the Blair Witch myth as well as on the disappearance of Heather, Josh, and Mike. As it turns out, the original witch was one Elly Kedward, who was accused in 1785 of taking blood from several children; she was subsequently banished to the harsh winter woods and left for dead. Her grisly and bloody legacy involves missing children, polluted water, disemboweled men, and a serial killer of children who claims to have been haunted by \"an old woman ghost.\" Aside from some ineffective \"newsreel\" footage of the serial killer, all this intriguing information is presented convincingly and chillingly.Cursemay in fact freak you out more than the movie, and it evokes the great, pulpyIn Search Ofseries of the '70s, one of the prime inspirations for filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez. News clips of the search for Heather, Josh, and Mike lend a v&eacute;rit&eacute; atmosphere to the proceedings, but shed little light on their mysterious disappearance or their characters. Basically, it's a tease to go see the movie.

{"description": "OK, let's get all the disclaimers out of the way first. Despite its colorful (if crude) animation,South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncutis in no way meant for kids. It is chock full of profanity that might even make Quentin Tarantino blanch and has blasphemous references to God, Satan, Saddam Hussein (who's sleeping with Satan, literally), and Canada. It's rife with scatological humor, suggestive sexual situations, political incorrectness, and gleeful, rampant vulgarity. And it's probably one of the most brilliant satires ever made. The plot: flatulent Canadian grossmeistersTerrance and Philip hit the big screen, and the South Park quartet of third graders--Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman--begin repeating their profane one-liners ad infinitum. The parents of South Park, led by Kyle's overbearing mom, form \"Mothers Against Canada,\" blaming their neighbors to the north for their children's corruption and taking Terrance and Philip as war prisoners. It's up to the kids then to rescue their heroes from execution, not mention a brooding Satan, who's planning to take over the world.To give away any more of the plot would destroy the fun, but this feature-length version of Trey Parker and Matt Stone's Comedy Central hit is a dead-on and hilarious send-up of pop culture. And did we mention it's amusical? From the opening production number \"Mountain Town\" to the cheerful antiprofanity sing-along \"It's Easy, MMMKay\" to Satan's faux-Disney ballad \"Up There,\" Parker (who wrote or cowrote all the songs) brilliantly shoots down every earnest musical fromBeauty and the BeasttoLes Mis&eacute;rables. And in advocating free speech and satirizing well-meaning but misguided parental censorship groups (with a special nod to the MPAA),Bigger, Longer & Uncuthits home against adult paranoia and hypocrisy with a vengeance. And the jokes, while indeed vulgar and gross, are hysterical; we can't repeat them here, especially the lyrics to Terrance and Philip's hit song, but you'll be rolling on the floor. Don't worry, though--to paraphrase Cartman, this movie won't warp your fragile little mind.

{"description": "High quality DVD manufactured in Hong Kong. Dialog in original English with optional subtitles in Chinese and English. On screen menus are in English and Chinese and are easy to use. Very clear full screen color image. The following review was written for the VHS version: It's been said that this 1948 classic has been responsible for the ballet lessons of more young girls than any other film. It's not hard to understand why: Michael Powell and Emerich Pressburger's dark fairy tale presents the ballet as an exquisite, magical work of art; but under the theatrics and glory is an all-consuming lifestyle with the power to destroy those who love it perhaps too much. Moira Shearer practically glows as Victoria \"Vicky\" Page, a young woman consumed by a will to dance who is accepted into the highly prestigious ballet company run by perfectionist Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook). Meanwhile, a gifted young composer, Julian Craster (Marius Goring), is brought on board as an orchestra coach, and later conductor and composer of the ballet that will make Vicky's name: The Red Shoes, one of the most beautiful and dramatic dances ever captured on film. Professional and personal jealousies soon pull this creative team apart, however, and Vicky is torn between her love of Julian, her responsibility to Boris, and her need to dance. Powell and Pressburger recast Hans Christian Andersen's sad story as a modern romantic melodrama, highlighted by beautiful dances and shot, not as stage ballets, but rather as expressionist cinematic dramas on impossibly grand sets awash with bold color and beautifully captured in glorious Technicolor by cinematographer Jack Cardiff. It's a brilliant melding of dance and drama as Vicky's real life mirror's the tragic story she danced in the Red Shoes ballet. --Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003ICZW7I", "B00008YOFG", "B00AQ6J64O", "B00004XQMY", "B004M66YUS", "B002TOL4E6", "B001IZNIV4", "B004NWPY3E", "B003N2CVOU", "B00007L4I6", "B00JAGF9Y2", "0780022629", "B000G5SIBM", "B000AQKUH2", "6305820767", "B00CYLZC4M", "B000FILVNM", "B000KRNGN6", "B005HK13S6", "B003ZYU3U0", "B0019X400I", "B001D8W7EU", "B001WLMOL4", "B0006GQMBY", "B00K6D1RO4", "B007N5YJPC", "B000025RE7", "B000BYA4HY", "B00005JLV7", "B00DZP1C9K", "B001LMU19G", "B000305ZYS", "B000AYEI9A", "B000BB1MGO", "B00B2BYY1W", "0780022343", "B001LMU1C8", "B005152C82", "B008CJ0JS4", "B0012Z361M", "B005CM1IOI", "B00EOBB6JA", "B00005NC66", "B005VU9LP4", "B000GDH9JQ", "B00005UQ7T", "B004WJT5G0", "B001M9ELJY", "B002LVF2H2", "B009NUHL8M", "B000NOK0HG", "B000E5LEV0", "B000BC8SWE", "B00AEFXD1O", "B0035ECHIG", "B00JAQJMJ0", "0780021134", "B000G8NXYG", "B000093NR0", "B00A01CQIS", "B00005JNIU", "B00AEBB89C", "B0007989ZC", "B0007PALVQ", "B004NWPY20", "0780021320", "B00005AUKD", "B009NYF2GQ", "B00AATV07S", "B005H8G78O", "B00DHN8FXG", "B00008AOWJ", "B00478ED2C", "B0000YEEHG", "B00005BCK0", "B0087ZG7R0", "B00HCSO9O6", "B003XMKMVE", "B000063N9O", "B00DHN8GGW", "6305416222", "B001D8W7F4", "B00K5EJHGO", "6305257450", "B001D8W7EK", "B0001V6ZJ8", "B005DI9906", "B001BEK8E2", "B00065GX64", "B00K6D1QV8", "B000TXNDV6", "B004NWPY7A", "B000QGE8JC", "B001D261ES", "B00H9HZITU", "B009NUHP24", "B003LMPKSQ", "B0001XAOPM", "B0009S4IJW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003N2CVOU", "B00007L4I6", "B001QOGYBI", "B00005QAPH"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 668756}, "asin": "7883062603", "imUrl": "http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-site/icons/no-img-sm._CB192198896_.gif", "title": "The Red Shoes directed by Michael Powell (Import)"}

{"description": "The Seven-Ups of the title are a hot-dogging special unit of the New York Police Department led by street smart Roy Scheider, who applies unconventional techniques to crack tough cases and nab untouchable criminals. When a pair of police impersonators pulls a series of mob kidnappings, the local hoods get very nervous and Scheider's boys investigate, leading to a squad member's death that turns the case personal. Director Philip D'Antoni previously producedBullittandThe French Connectionand learned the importance of a good car chase: with craftsmanlike efficiency he delivers a textbook example of the inner-city chase, lacking style but chock full of squealing tires, careening cars, fleeing pedestrians, and dynamite crackups. The New York City street shooting and the ever-present street sounds give the film a solid sense of place, and Scheider applies his usual thoughtful intensity as the vengeful cop, but the rest of the cops are woefully undeveloped. Only Tony LoBianco, as Scheider's childhood buddy turned hustler and street snitch, has any real presence next to Scheider. In the pantheon of '70s cop thrillers,The Seven-Upsranks below the more vigorous and ambiguous classics likeSerpicoandThe French Connection, but excellent stunt work and gritty action raises it above the pack.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300181723"]}, "price": 28.48, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 462179}, "asin": "B000006GDP", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/215K5RDEW8L.jpg", "title": "The Seven-Ups [VHS]"}

{"description": "There's no rule against rock anthems from the 1970s in the soundtrack for a movie about a medieval jousting champion, but if you're going to attempt such jarring anachronisms, you'd better establish acceptable ground rules. Writer-director Brian Helgeland does precisely that inA Knight's Taleand pulls off this trick with such giddy aplomb that you can't help but play along. (Upon witnessing a crowd of peasants at a jousting match, singing and clapping to the beat of Queen's \"We Will Rock You,\" you're either going to love this movie or dismiss it altogether.) Other vintage rock hits will follow, but Helgeland--the Oscar&#xAE;-winning cowriter ofL.A. Confidential--handles this ploy with judicious goodwill, in what is an otherwise honest period piece about a peasant named William (Heath Ledger) who rises by grit and determination to the hallowed status of knighthood.As if the soundtrack weren't audacious enough, Helgeland (recovering from the sour experience of his directorial debut,Payback) casts none other than Geoffrey Chaucer (wonderfully played by Paul Bettany) as William's cohort and match announcer, along with William's pals Roland (Mark Addy) and Wat (Alan Tudyk), and feisty blacksmith Kate (Laura Fraser). Of course there must be a fair maiden, and she is Jocelyn (newcomer Shannyn Sossamon), with whom William falls in love while battling the nefarious Count Adhemar (Rufus Sewell) on the European jousting circuit. Add to this an inspiring father-son reunion, Ledger's undeniable charisma, a perfect supporting cast, and enough joyful energy to rejuvenate the film's formulaic plot, andA Knight's Talebecomes that most pleasant of movie surprises--an unlikely winner that rises up, like its hero, to exceed all expectations.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EDWKXI", "0800141601", "B00447L4KA", "B00006ZXSK", "B004SEUIWY", "B002VWNID6", "B00004XPPG", "B00003CXC3", "B00005EBIL", "B000ARXF96", "B00AEFXKUI", "B004SUDQ40", "B001HN69AY", "B004SIP9U6", "0792839137", "B0002YLCG0", "B003UYUQZW", "B003FCKIGQ", "B000056VP4", "B002NZK5V4", "B00005JLO2", "B002O3Z50Q", "B002O3Z4XY", "B00AEFY5B6", "B000GGSMO4", "6305428077", "B00003CXG7", "B00004WG2F", "B00005JN0T", "B0010V4VJY", "B005ORVN00", "B00000JQB5", "6305428042", "6305123454", "0783225814", "B00AEBB9UU", "6305692688", "B0000WN0SW", "B000MGUZCU", "B00006ADFM", "B00005JKCH", "B00AMEZDJW", "B0000TPA0G", "B0000844I8", "B002GHHHHO", "0783240295", "B000K7VHQ4", "B00000K3UU", "B00005JKMN", "B000EPFCPE", "B0006GAI5U", "B0007IO6NM", "B002K0WBXW", "0767821513", "B00005QJJG", "B00008EYA5", "B00004Z4WR", "B00005JKNV", "B00005LOL0", "B004SIP6BI", "B00003CXHJ", "B002NXSRVG", "B002ZG999U", "B004SEUJ9Q", "0783233477", "B000T5O47Q", "B00F84H73Q", "B003U0AHBO", "B00004W4UD", "B00AEFXYOA", "B000AARKOO", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B00005JM5B", "B0001HLVS2", "6305428387", "B002GHHHME", "B000LC55F2", "B00AEBB8R4", "B007SPPANM", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00BLN4V46", "B000EGDB10", "0800195175", "B000FKO5QK", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00BTYSIWI", "B0038N9X3Q", "6305609764", "B000K4WPCC", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00011CZRE", "B00005JMOW", "0800141741", "B00005JPD0", "B001DDBD4K", "B00008G7UF", "B000209KMW", "1558908382", "B004LWZWGA", "B0009RCPUW"], "bought_together": ["B00447L4KA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0800141601", "B00447L4KA", "B00003CXC3"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7604}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "Columbia Telecommunications", "asin": "B00000F4ZY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51rNtZ4oMwL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Knight's Tale (Special Edition)"}

{"description": "Considered by many to represent a low point in Steven Spielberg's  career,  1990'sAlwaysdid suggest something of a temporary drift in the  director's sensibility. A remake of the  classic Spencer Tracy filmA Guy Named Joe,Alwaysstars  Richard Dreyfuss as a Forest Service pilot who takes great risks with his own  life to douse wildfires from a plane. After promising his frightened fianc&eacute;e  (Holly Hunter) to keep his feet on the ground and go into teaching,  Dreyfuss's character is killed during one last flight. But his spirit wanders  restlessly, hopelessly attached to and possessive of Hunter, who can't see or  hear him. Then the real conflict begins: a trainee pilot (Brad Johnson), a  likable doofus, begins wooing a not-unappreciative Hunter--and it becomes  Dreyfuss's heavenly mandate to accept, and even assist in, their budding  romance. The trouble with the film is a certain airlessness, a  hyper-inventiveness in every scene and sequence that screams of Spielberg's self-education in Hollywood classicism. Unlike the masters he is constantly quoting and emulating inAlways, he forgets to back off and let the  movie breathe on its own sometimes, which would better serve his clockwork  orchestration of suspense and comedy elsewhere. Still, there are lovely  passages in this film, such as the unforgettable look on Dreyfuss's face a  half-second before fate claims him.

{"description": "Imagine if an actor's director like Eric Rohmer--whose films consist almost entirely of conversation between pairs or small groups of people--made a film that incorporated elements from movies likeDark City,eXistenZ,The Thirteenth Floor,The Truman Show, andTotal Recall. The result might resemble Alejandro Amenabar's remarkable second feature,Open Your Eyes, which favors ideas over effects and offers twist upon twist with mind-warping agility. This film rewards multiple viewings, pushing the viewer toward one perception of reality, then switching to another until reality itself is called into question. Melodrama, love story, and psychological thriller combine with a dash of science fiction, forming a plot that is both disorienting and deceptively precise.Set in Madrid, the story defies description, but this much can be revealed: young, handsome Cesar (Eduardo Noriega) is vain, rich, charming, and--following a botched suicide-murder scheme by a jilted lover--horribly disfigured. He'd fallen in love with Sofia (Pen&eacute;lope Cruz) but is now an embittered husk of his former self, stuck in a \"psychiatric penitentiary\" on a murder charge and hiding behind an expressionless mask. His reality has crumbled, but as the film's agenda is gradually revealed, we realize that there are other factors in play. Exposing that agenda would be a criminal offense against those who haven't seen the film; suffice it to say thatOpen Your Eyestakes you into the twilight zone and beyond, and does so cleverly enough to prompt Tom Cruise to produce and star in an English-language remake,Vanilla Sky. The 2001 remake, directed by Cameron Crowe, costars Cameron Diaz and Pen&eacute;lope Cruz, who reprises her original role.--Jeff Shannon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 580019}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.98, "brand": "", "asin": "B00000JMOI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41R2BBJY96L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Open Your Eyes [VHS]"}
{"description": "When Steven Spielberg was an adolescent, his first home movie was a backyard war film. When he toured Europe withDuelin his 20s, he saw old men crumble in front of headstones at Omaha Beach. That image became the opening scene ofSaving Private Ryan, his film of a mission following the D-day invasion that many have called the most realistic--and maybe the best--war film ever. With 1998 production standards, Spielberg has been able to create a stunning, unparalleled view of war as hell. We are at Omaha Beach as troops are slaughtered by Germans yet overcome the almost insurmountable odds.A stalwart Tom Hanks plays Captain Miller, a soldier's soldier, who takes a small band of troops behind enemy lines to retrieve a private whose three brothers have recently been killed in action. It's a public relations move for the Army, but it has historical precedent dating back to the Civil War. Some critics of the film have labeled the central characters stereotypes. If that is so, this movie gives stereotypes a good name: Tom Sizemore as the deft sergeant, Edward Burns as the hotheaded Private Reiben, Barry Pepper as the religious sniper, Adam Goldberg as the lone Jew, Vin Diesel as the oversize Private Caparzo, Giovanni Ribisi as the soulful medic, and Jeremy Davies, who as a meek corporal gives the film its most memorable performance.The movie is as heavy and realistic as Spielberg's Oscar-winningSchindler's List, but it's more kinetic. Spielberg and his ace technicians (the film won five Oscars: editing (Michael Kahn), cinematography (Janusz Kaminski), sound, sound effects, and directing) deliver battle sequences that wash over the eyes and hit the gut. The violence is extreme but never gratuitous. The final battle, a dizzying display of gusto, empathy, and chaos, leads to a profound repose.Saving Private Ryantouches us deeper thanSchindlerbecause it succinctly links the past with how we should feel today. It's the film Spielberg was destined to make.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006C7G9", "6303168507", "6303057225", "B00AEBBA36", "6302529441", "0800125762", "6304935811", "B00003CXTF", "B000EHSVS2", "0790734060", "6303257844", "6302415853", "B0007TKNGA", "6301247345", "6301662954", "0790734079", "6302610702", "6302909023", "630407185X", "0783221347", "079213690X", "0800132009", "0790701251", "6305363668", "6301115430", "0790752395", "6304071876", "6300268748"], "bought_together": ["B00006C7G9"], "also_viewed": ["0792151712", "6301792734", "0792837614", "B00003CXXO", "6303109950", "6304117752", "6303402348", "6303168507", "B00003CXTF", "B000RC7QVC", "0783221347", "078323662X", "630018627X", "6304151306", "0783230095", "6304233639", "B0000040EJ", "6303187064"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 269908}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.5, "brand": "", "asin": "B00000K3AM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4143F912CXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Saving Private Ryan [VHS]"}

{"description": "The poster forTeaching Mrs. Tinglemay feature young TV cuties Katie Holmes (Dawson's Creek), Marisa Coughlin (Wasteland), and Barry Watson (Seventh Heaven), but the real star is the actress playing the title character: Helen Mirren. Mirren plays a bitter, tyrannical teacher who, due to circumstantial evidence, believes goody two-shoes Holmes is guilty of cheating on her history final. Holmes, Coughlin, and Watson go to Mirren's home to convince her that there's been a misunderstanding, but Mirren refuses to listen. Terrified that this will ruin her chances to go to college, Holmes and her compatriots knock Mirren out and tie her to her bed. Unfortunately, they haven't any idea what to do next; when Mirren awakes, the situation becomes a battle of wits in which the teenagers are hopelessly outmatched. Coughlin and Watson are pretty to look at and Holmes has some genuine talent and a lot of charm, but Mirren--who's played Shakespeare on the stage and been in movies ranging from lurid and trashy (Caligula) to eerie and arty (The Comfort of Strangers) to lurid, trashy, eerie,andarty (The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover)--combines the cutting intelligence of Vanessa Redgrave, the steely will of Judi Dench, and a sensual energy that any young starlet would kill for. For fans of the British TV seriesPrime Suspect, in which Mirren plays the tough yet vulnerable Inspector Tennyson, this teen comedy-thriller is just an amusing footnote in Mirren's career; but if you've never been transfixed by this actress's mischievous sidelong glances,Teaching Mrs. Tinglemight provide a good start.--Bret Fetzer", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 484361}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "", "asin": "B00002EQ0I", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71500PABZEL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Teaching Mrs Tingle [VHS]"}

{"description": "As the triumphant start of a trilogy,The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ringleaves you begging for more. By necessity, Peter  Jackson's ambitious epic compresses J.R.R. Tolkien's classicThe Lord of the Rings,  but this robust adaptation maintains reverent allegiance to Tolkien's creation,  instantly qualifying as one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. At 178  minutes, it's long enough to establish the myriad inhabitants of Middle-earth,  the legendary Rings of Power, and the fellowship of hobbits, elves, dwarves, and  humans--led by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the brave hobbit Frodo  (Elijah Wood)--who must battle terrifying forces of evil on their perilous  journey to destroy the One Ring in the land of Mordor. Superbly paced, the film  is both epic and intimate, offering astonishing special effects and production  design while emphasizing the emotional intensity of Frodo's adventure. Ending on  a perfect note of heroic loyalty and rich anticipation, this wondrous fantasy  continues inThe Two Towers(2002).--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B005COPWZW", "B00005JM5E", "B002ZG980U", "B002PMV9FG", "B001GZ6QC4", "B007K3JFUQ", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JNJV", "B001OQCV6A", "B004M1A21K", "B008UZ7MYY", "B00HFFE8HE", "B000A9QKLO", "B000E8M0VA", "B000W7F5SS", "B0014C2FX8", "0618640150", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00003CX5P", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00005QZWI", "B0019L770A", "B000I0RQVI", "B002IPFWTE", "B001CDR1FG", "B0006UEVT0", "B003TT2X6S", "B001OQCV2E", "B009JBWOU0", "B00005JL78", "B00005JNOG", "B001UV4XHY", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B00GKOJ98E", "0345325818", "B0014Z4ON4", "B000H30B2C", "B005LXQLRW", "B001UV4XIS", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00CZDLGDU", "0345538374", "B004LWZW42", "B007REV4T8", "B000W746GK", "B00005JPH2", "B003TT2X72", "B004LWZWGA", "B0087ZG7J8", "B005G4TJUC", "B003ZK99NQ", "B00006HBUJ", "B008UZA8FY", "B0090SI56Y", "B000VI70QS", "B00005JNC2", "B004WCTLNY", "B0014Z4OMU", "6305313687", "B004AKCME8", "B000E6EK2Y", "0547928211", "B000LC55F2", "B0002KVUKM", "B000FQJAIW", "B008JFUO72", "B000FIMG68", "B005LAIHSG", "B005LAIIT4", "B004AOECXI", "B00029RTCG", "B000P0J0EM", "B002HWRYJE", "B0060FXDCG", "B001ECQ75A", "0792839749", "B00AEFXZJE", "B005LAII0I", "B0042U94UQ", "B001HN6918", "B00008G8M5", "B008JFURII", "B003ZKBELG", "B000P0J09W", "B003XURDAY", "B00335EQ0E", "B00008G8M4", "0547928203", "B000W796OM", "B00006ADD5", "B00J49R1BY", "B00B04NIZO", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00001ZWUS"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HFFE8HE", "B00005JKZY", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00005JKZV"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3641}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.49, "brand": "NEW Line Home Video", "asin": "B00003CWT6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Dj%2BQ1hLBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)"}

{"description": "Originally developed as an epic calledKingdom of the Sun,The Emperor's New Groovelost scale and most of Sting's song score (some of which can be heard on the soundtrack) on its way to the screen. The end result is the lightest Disney film in many a moon, a joyous romp akin toAladdinin its quotient of laughs for kids and adults. The original story centers on the spoiled teenage emperor Kuzco (David Spade), who enjoys getting the best of his Aztecan subjects. When he fires Yzma (Eartha Kitt), his evil sorceress, she seeks revenge and turns Kuzco into a llama with the help of her hunk of the month, a lunk named Kronk (Patrick Warburton). Alone in the jungle, the talking llama is befriended by Pacha (John Goodman), who has just been told to vacate his pastoral home by the human Kuzco. What's an ego to do? That's pretty much the story and the characters--simple, direct, fun--a Disney film on a diet. For any fan of the acidic humor of Spade, this is essential viewing. As narrator of his tale, Kuzco uses a sarcastic tone to keep the story jumping with plenty of fun asides (he even \"stops\" the film at one point to make sure you know the story is abouthim). Even better is character actor Warburton (Elaine's stuck-up boyfriend onSeinfeld), who steals every scene as the dim-witted, but oh-so-likable Kronk. There's even a delicious Tom Jones number that starts the film off with a bang.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["0788805843", "6305229449", "B00005JKDQ", "B00005JL95", "B00005RDVV", "6302526574", "B000035Z2S", "0788812408", "B0000AQZYM", "6300275310", "6304290888", "6304401132", "6303314015", "0788802194", "6302787068", "6304089767", "6303983812", "6304500831", "B00003CX7L", "6303534422", "6302642248", "B00003CXHR", "B00005JLR1", "0788805533", "B00016JF2W", "078881172X", "6302178924", "6304978286", "0788812807", "6305326940", "6305319138", "6300274268", "6302961572", "6304100507", "155890641X", "0788806270", "0788803743", "6305940932", "6302320402", "B00004R99N", "6300274195", "6303929338", "B00003CWPW", "B00003CXXI", "6302426200", "B0000E32WB", "B00003CXG6", "B00005T7H6", "6304400551", "B00005JKX3", "6304501153", "6304089201", "0788812440", "6301991311", "0788811002", "6303036813", "B000JBWWRO", "B000B8QFYG", "6300274608", "6302158095", "B0000524CZ", "B000035Z46", "6303122647", "6305318867", "6304155972", "B00000ICHA", "B0002YLCHE", "6304401736", "0783236689", "B00004R996", "6304416415", "6304176996", "1558906150", "B0007Z9R0M", "B00006CXK5", "B00005JMQY", "0788809806", "B00006IUM9", "B00004R99A", "B00029LO18", "6304873441", "B000028U3S", "6304400225", "B0007A2GSM", "6301948106", "6301390725", "B00003CWPX", "6303929567", "6302968143", "B00004R99I", "6303232221", "078880720X", "6304434340", "B00003CXG7", "6305177473", "0788812181", "B00003CXQ6", "B000009CTR", "B000DWMYQ8"], "bought_together": ["0788805843", "6305229449"], "also_viewed": ["0788805843", "B00005JKDQ", "6304089767", "155890641X", "6303314015", "078881172X", "6302787068", "6302526574", "0788805533", "6305326940", "0788812408", "B00005JL95", "0788802194", "0788806270", "B0000AQZYM", "6302320402", "6302642248", "6303929338", "6304500831", "6303534422", "B00003CX7L", "6305229449", "6304401132", "B00005RDVV", "0788812807", "6304400551", "6304290888", "6300275310", "B000035Z2S", "6305940932", "6303983812", "B00003CXHR", "6304089201", "B00016JF2W", "6303036813", "B00006CXK5", "6302158095", "B0007KTBIU", "6300274268", "6305319138", "B00003CXG6", "B000035Z46", "6302178924", "6300274195", "B00005JLR1", "B0000E32WB", "6303122647", "6302961572", "6304100507", "B00005JKX3", "6301991311", "6304978286", "B00003CXXI", "B0000524CZ", "6303939015", "6304501153", "6302426200", "B00005T7H6", "B00004R99N"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 169967}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.39, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXQX", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CARZ3R0XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Emperor's New Groove [VHS]"}
{"description": "Imagine a Cheech and Chong pothead comedy, only instead of two scruffy  lowlifes, the movie is about an aimless Scottish gardener and a middle-aged  British widow with a green thumb. Grace (Brenda Blethyn ofSecrets and  LiesandLittle Voice) has just discovered that her recently deceased  husband has left her with an enormous debt when her gardener Matthew (Craig  Ferguson,The Big Tease) asks her to help him tend to his small,  personal-use marijuana crop. Grace soon realizes that they can turn her green  house into a hydroponics laboratory and turn out a profitable crop--if only they  can keep the local constables at bay and then find a dealer to actually sell the  stuff.Saving Gracehas well-developed characters, intelligent dialogue,  a charming and capable cast, and clean, clear direction. But at heart it's still  a marijuana comedy, with most of its funniest moments coming from the silly,  stoned behavior of elderly ladies and other stuffy Brits. Nothing wrong with  that, and Blethyn and Ferguson give the film a strong anchor. The ending goes a  little over-the-top, but most of the movie is well-grounded in genuine human  behavior. A subplot about Matthew's girlfriend's pregnancy is treated with  respect and integrity. Sweet, silly, and sincere.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000TG492", "0790748460", "B0050N0UR0", "B00HHYF5DE", "B0046MOVDU", "B00FPPQYXM", "B00000ILEC", "B000LPS2W2", "B00A27O0N4", "B004WBC43E", "B001NFNFIU", "B005FHHD58", "B000FQISV2", "0340977051", "B00CQRNLLU", "B00G35R9ZK", "B000PC6YQC", "B000063K0J", "B0001I55M4", "B001053024", "B000Z27HFE", "B000CDGVPI", "B00FBQ38VQ", "B000ULPFFE", "B00005RYKX", "B000LPS34E", "0091953480", "B004KVXC8C", "0811853756", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B005S9EJ14", "B000BITVAG", "B0009A1BW2", "B0050N0US4", "185782802X", "B000H6SXYW", "B000O7860A", "B00AZMFO6I", "B00GAXASK8", "B008OTTTP6", "B0000CE684", "0091953499", "B007HCI4H0", "B00069WF8U", "B0011KQSZ4", "6305622914", "B000ETRCN0", "630560097X", "B00320J6WS", "B00A27OJ94", "B004SIP7D0", "B0000714BW", "B00H4ZEFTQ", "B00GWXI2RM", "B0038M2S2A", "B0080QOL10", "B005N8KP3Q", "6305428557", "B00EPH8SBM", "B00009IB1D", "B00009MEKA", "B004SIP6BI", "B00GPWEPZ8", "B0028AEO0M", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00005Y6XU", "B00BEIYGK2", "6305588236", "B0000VD02Y", "B005A1GS00", "B00BCXW106", "B00IBKXP8A", "1250047560", "B000GW8U4A", "B002TY78OQ", "B000SINSYO", "B00069WF94", "B0001US78G", "B00HUAGZ34", "B00AEFXYOA", "B001V7YZHA", "B00GWXI20E", "B00G15MDI0", "B007L6VR12", "B00EF0NVGQ", "B000M8NGYM", "B005WAP2V0", "B00GWXI1F0", "B00006FDAX", "B00GAHJO8G", "B00DL48BM6", "B000EHRVOW", "B000FOPPCE", "B00C888LOO", "B004SIP6C2", "B00GAHG7PE", "B00EIBO8T6", "B00A429YF6", "B00005TNEQ"], "bought_together": ["B00FPPQYXM", "B0050N0UR0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00FPPQYXM", "B00A27O0N4", "B00HHYF5DE", "B00G35R9ZK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3408}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.76, "brand": "NEW Line Home Video", "asin": "B00003CXMY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PHoi8EqfL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Saving Grace"}

Director Frank Oz's heist thriller partners De Niro with hotshot upstart Edward Norton, and you'd have to be determinedly grumpy not to get half a kick out of Brando, DeNiro, and Norton--more than holding his own--coolly bouncing off one another in a Method paradise. Brando may be enormous and breathing heavily with every move, but his technique is as agile as it ever was; he still seems spontaneously clever. Oz doesn't have the most crackling visual style in the world, as the film is far too smooth for tension, and keeps tapping Howard Shore's music score to do most of the work in that department; the divine Angela Bassett is once again totally wasted in a 10-minute throwaway role as De Niro's girlfriend.The Scoreisn't anything new, and there isn't a single surprise, but if you're into this sort of thing you do respond to its polished familiarity.--Steve Wiecking", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 801891}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Score", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005UQ9T", "B0047T74CM", "B00008K7AO", "B0015OKWL2", "6305263248", "B001MZ5W3M", "B000P0J0AG", "B0000B1OFL", "B002WNU0QW", "B00562D3Y2", "B00005JLX2", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B002O3Z4WK", "B000ENC5YW", "B000GFLKF8", "B001NY4WYC", "6305313687", "B001C5LLLY", "B00096S49Y", "B002DU39GW", "B00005LDDD", "B00005V9HH", "B000K7VHQ4", "B003L20IG0", "B00004XPPB", "B00AEFXT1S", "B005LAIGRS", "B00AEBB95K", "B000GDH9NM", "B0034G4OSG", "B0000DI87S", "B00005JLKN", "B00005JKBC", "B000C20VPA", "B000P0J09M", "0800141822", "B00008O38F", "0783240295", "B00AEBB9NM", "B0008KLVAU", "B000QUCRB4", "B000M341QE", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002VWNIEA", "B002AT8K9W", "B002CPMB9O", "B003ASLJIQ", "0767830555", "6305310335", "B00004ZDFL", "0783226888", "B00AEBB86A", "6305428115", "B000067IZ3", "B001N44BVQ", "B000NOIX48", "B001UV4XRY", "B000OYAT3U", "B00HOGBXS6", "B004EPYZP8", "B002ZG99N6", "B000286RP2", "B002NZK5VO", "6304711891", "B00011CZRE", "B000069HZP", "B0019EXZY4", "B000GRUMSM", "0767802519", "B000CNESTE", "B001BP4K22", "B002QEHPQU", "B00FRILRL6", "B00CX7TOOG", "B0051MKNV8", "B00015YVDG", "B004HO6HWA", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B00AEFXIIW", "B00AEFYF2K", "B000R4SMCW", "B00441GYZ6", "B0006HBZXS", "B000MXPE7O", "B00005BCKF", "B00008OE4W", "B004SIP7VM", "B0062P3392", "B00BB67UNW", "B0006GANOQ", "B00005JN0W", "B00AEFXEGS", "B000244GCW", "B002AT8KAG", "B003AWRMCE", "B004SIP8ZM", "B003A12WBQ", "B008JFUNKU", "B00KHA99BY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002O3Z4Y8", "6304711891", "B00562D3Y2", "B000GFLKF8"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21SM525DAZL.jpg", "asin": "B00003CY5H"}

{"description": "Julia Roberts outdoes herself in yet another David and Goliath struggle based on a true story. Erin Brockovich (Roberts) is a down-on-her-luck mother of three who can't seem to hold down a job. After having an auto accident, she makes a bumpy transition from client to employee at the law firm and stumbles onto a case with staggering implications. It seems that utility giant PG&E; has poisoned the groundwater and the local residents are getting gravely ill.\nThe story starts poorly with scenes of Erin looking for jobs and botching her accident case. The first twenty minutes of the film could have been condensed into five. However, once the investigation of the case begins, the story is engrossing. It is a powerful and well written human interest drama centered on a tough and smart (though crude) woman who leads a passionate crusade on behalf of the victims.\nDirector Steven Soderberg played it straight in filming this after his extremely avant-garde effort in \"The Limey\". His key strength here was the direction of the actors with both Julia Roberts and Albert Finney giving excellent interpretations of their characters. However, my only negative criticism of the film was the way Erin's boyfriend George was presented. George is a grubby tattoo covered biker (the tattoo on his left shoulder says \"DIRTY\") who behaves like Ward Cleaver with a ponytail. He is genteel, articulate, level headed, patient, sensitive and kind. All of this is so disconnected with his lifestyle that it seems inconceivable that a character this wonderful could possibly come in this package.\nJulia Roberts' gave a superlative performance that smashed any myth about her inability as a dramatic actor.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783241569", "6301796535", "6303269834", "B008JFUNKU", "0790748169", "6303637574", "B0001E7LQG", "6304259131", "B00329TVQA", "0792116887", "6302936381", "6305426694", "6301734734", "0783222955", "B004IFIMT4", "6305368139", "B000007OY0", "0790751089", "B00007E2F6", "6300214222", "6302935148", "6302820448", "0800125762", "B000053VDQ", "B00005LQ1P", "B00004RT4K", "630394518X", "0782006779", "B0000040EO", "080018789X", "6302779278", "0792841859", "630266232X", "6303696813", "6304178352", "0793927501", "6301798503", "630233683X", "6300269043", "6301670159", "6302797667"], "bought_together": ["6301796535"], "also_viewed": ["6302158095", "6303637574"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 100360}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.58, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXFU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51D1C8BJXAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Erin Brockovich [VHS]"}

{"description": "One of Humphrey Bogart's earliest starring vehicles, this 1936 melodrama typifies the Warner Bros. touch in its modest but potent production values and Depression-era social acumen. Prompted by contemporary news reports of new neofascist groups targeting political and religious minorities, the script conjures up a shadowy, Klan-like organization preying on factory workers to set them against blue-collar immigrants. Bogart is Frank Taylor, a hard-working drill-press operator hoping for a promotion that can help him better provide for his adoring wife and cherubic young son. Frank's coworkers reassure him he'll snag the foreman's post, but when a studious young Polish American gets the nod, Frank's bitter disappointment sets the stage for the tragedy that follows.What proceeds in this 83-minute feature is a pointed morality play about tolerance and democracy. The legion's rank and file invoke a \"free, white, and 100 percent American\" future in justifying their scare tactics, which hound Frank's rival out of town, briefly gaining him the coveted job. But his deepening involvement in the mob soon drives wife and son away, costs him his job, and ultimately spurs him to murder his best friend, Ed (Dick Foran). Indicted for the murder, Frank is nearly acquitted by a crooked defense team funded by the corrupt businessmen who are bankrolling the legion (more to profit off the sale of robes and revolvers than to incite any real political change), but his climactic, cathartic pang of conscience brings the tale to its moralistic end.Bogart, who dutifully marched through dozens of features before graduating to true stardom, gives the simplistic story its modest power through a credible performance that traces Frank's descent from streetwise but principled worker to angry, disillusioned thug. The supporting cast also includes Ann Sheridan, likewise fine in an otherwise two-dimensional role as Foran's wife.--Sam Sutherland", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 485731}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.5, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003XAMX", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SD3T5H8ML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Black Legion [VHS]"}

{"description": "Adam Simon (Carnosaur) made his directoral debut with this  mind game of a movie. Based on a decades-old screenplay by formerTwilight Zonecontributor Charles Beaumont, Simon dusted off and  updated the script about an experimental brain researcher (Bill Pullman)  who agrees to dig into the gray matter of a schizophrenic scientist (Bud  Cort), only to fall prey to his patient's psychosis. Or maybe he's just  plain nuts. Spiced with a bizarre sense of humor (Pullman wrestles over a  brain specimen in a jar with a homeless man who tries to grab it: \"That's my  brain!\"), Pullman's ordeal takes one hairpin turn after another as he  becomes lost in a maze of alternate realities, no longer able to sort  fantasy from reality or paranoia from persecution. This clever puzzle of a film  overcomes low-budget restrictions with a deviously inventive story that echoesBraziland quotes fromThe Manchurian CandidateandNorth by  Northwest. Bill Paxton costars as a smarmy corporate manipulator with  slicked back hair and a get-rich-quick scheme for a chain of brain surgery  boutiques (\"The New You, by Eunice!\"), and George Kennedy is his bottom-line  boss. Director Simon may be most famous for playing himself in a jokey cameo in  Robert Altman'sThe Player.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00JJOY4RI", "B00004Z1GI", "B00JJOY47I", "B00HRUQB8Q", "B00GHH9IIA", "B00DOZNGTK", "B001MEJY8W", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B003L1YESE", "B00EALTVAA", "B00CPTUNZG", "B001B187L6", "B00GJ7CUFG", "B00E5S2HGS", "B0007WQHI0", "B000F3UA8E", "B00EL6ACBQ", "B00A429Y9M", "B004VQRCJG", "B00ESZZOOK", "B000TZJCN2", "B005OT7ZWI", "B00EU8RCO0", "B005ZHBEPI", "157362408X", "B003ZGJM96", "B000099T3M", "B00H7BJ0C4", "B000EOTTYK", "B00B04NJE4", "B00023P4UQ", "B000094J72", "B00BTYPW7C", "B0000694WH", "B0053TWW9K", "B00A429Y56", "B0079ZWTOO", "B003VJTGNE", "B001G9CNI6", "B00C3KTFVU", "B00005JLEY", "B001B8XRT6", "B009INAJ6A", "B005CVFZ66", "B000S0GYRU", "B00DZP1C8Q", "B001152TL6", "B00C7E3EDW", "B00EU8RC1S", "B00CPTUNUG", "B005GPFZEK", "B004SLIS7E", "B00BHMCRFG", "B0053TWVWI", "B002EOVXBK", "B008VBSR7S", "B00AJXO5X6", "B0055CP9TU", "B002P8LKCM", "B0072GPQ8G", "B009INAF9Q", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B000069I05", "B00005KH30", "0783227434", "B000FFJZO2", "B00DZP1C9K", "B0001I55U6", "B000RTB0R6", "B00030AZEI", "B00008IAKP", "B000VSOZS4", "B00004TJL5", "B000059H8V", "B0001I2BZS"], "bought_together": ["B00004Z1GI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["157362408X", "B008CYDD7I", "B00004Z1GI", "B0002C9DK4"]}, "price": 12.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 404704}, "asin": "B00004WG8V", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PC0KY68DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Brain Dead"}

The \"True Patriots\" featurette is much better, examining the painstaking efforts toward authenticity in production design, artillery, and costuming. The visual effects featurette offers a study of several pivotal shots, displayed in triptych fashion (to show how effects are layered together from separate elements) and narrated by visual effects supervisor Stuart Robertson. Generous photo galleries are included, featuring shots of the primary cast, sets, and costumes (the last matched by a gallery of conceptual drawings), and the feature-length commentary by director Roland Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin is worthwhile, if not altogether essential.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFXKUI", "B00AMSLDTM", "B00AEBBA36", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00001ZWUS", "0800177967", "B000A2WP7O", "B00008G8M4", "B00003CXTG", "B004AOECXI", "B002O3Z510", "B000065U1N", "B00005221M", "B00000G3PA", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000E5N6LG", "B002O3Z50Q", "B0001HLVS2", "079284646X", "B00003CXA6", "B008MIMWOY", "6304711905", "0783225733", "B002VWNID6", "B0002WZTOI", "B000P0J0EW", "B00009OOFA", "B000NOKFHQ", "0783231202", "B000P0J0EM", "B003U0AHBO", "B004SIP7TE", "B00003CXQA", "B0000TANUI", "0792839137", "B00011CZRE", "B00005B6JZ", "B0002DRDBY", "B00AEFXRRO", "B002AS464Q", "B000WGWQG8", "B00026L9CU", "B00005JN5E", "B00007GZYC", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005ATZT", "B000067D1R", "B000U1ZV8K", "B00B0U2SFE", "B003AWRMCE", "6304806434", "B00AEBB932", "B00005JM6F", "B00005JL3T", "B002ZG997C", "B00AEFXVCU", "B000FI8MPW", "B000VKL6ZM", "B00319ECI8", "B005LAIGYQ", "B0045HCJT4", "B0008JIJ2O", "B002O3Z50G", "B00AZNEW5G", "B00008AOTO", "B000LP6KNU", "0783227973", "B002VWNIBI", "B004FQX5B6", "B00AEBB9WI", "B004IK30M8", "B004IK30MI", "B0007PALM0", "B00AEBBA0E", "B001TK80D4", "B000O77SRC", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000095WW8", "079283366X", "6305558167", "B00AEFXKOO", "B0007TKNM4", "B0002YLCG0", "B00003CXHJ", "B000MZHW40", "B000F48D4G", "B001BNFRB2", "B00AEFXYJA", "B000QXDED6", "0767817710", "B0004Z33EG", "B00005JN0W", "B003ASLJRC", "B00HEPE6MM", "0790729695", "B000FVQLRA", "B00004WG2F", "B008MIMWQW", "B000GG4Y32", "B0068FZ0O2"], "bought_together": ["B00001ZWUS", "B00AEBBA36"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFY5B6", "B004AOECXI", "B000NOKFHQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2823}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00004XPPG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NDFXHAW9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Patriot (Special Edition)"}
{"description": "Along withFantasiaandFantasia 2000, the  anthology set contains a third disc that examines a segment of both  movies in detail. Each segment has an introduction that has experts  (including Leonard Maltin), producer Roy E. Disney, or the animators  setting up the piece's history. Notes on the music and dozens of design  photos are included on all the segments, although others offer more  intriguing features. Abandoned animation is shown on many segments, as  are a few behind-the-scenes shorts; the most intriguing are experts  from Walt Disney's hosted documentaries on how his company made movies.  As for the photos, they are awkwardly catalogued and only the most  patient of viewers would want to look at all of them. In some segments,  though, these images are entertainingly produced as a \"story reel,\"  presenting these images--rough animation, sketches, pastel  paintings--with the musical accompaniment. For those looking for a more  well-rounded view of the films, the two one-hour documentaries on each film's disc lay the groundwork, but none of the anthology looks at how  the first film was seen through the years or gives time to anyone who  wasn't gung-ho about every element of the films. There is hardly a  mention of embarrassing stereotypes that were matted (and still are)  out of the \"Pastoral\" segment, or the intriguing aspect of the film as  a '60s icon for the ultimate head-trip. Disney does let their guard  down to show sequences that were being readied in 1940 for future  editions (including a recently restored short scored to \"Clair de  Lune\"). Most tantalizing is a look at how the special effects were done  in the original film. The guide is a scrapbook that one of the  technicians kept and was discovered only in 1990. Fans can only hope a  reproduction will be made available someday.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00KBES386", "B00004R99B", "B00004R99H", "B00004R99D", "0486287858", "B0040QTNSU", "B0040JHNAW", "B001ILFUDC", "B0012RLXBU", "0810980789", "0486462145", "B00006II6O", "B002A00J0O", "B0034GK74G", "B00008EY6W", "B00004U9WQ", "B0000BWVAI", "B00003CXCQ", "1579121489", "B00004R99S", "B000001M4K", "B00838HSYM", "B000YERP2S", "B004C03TJ8", "B000B8QG4A", "B0000BWVAF", "B000AAF1TU", "B0002YLCOM", "B006ML50SS", "B003H9M1Q2", "B00004R99Y", "B000063UR0", "B000GW8U1I", "B00447L4JG", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B0084IHVGG", "B003ZHVJGO", "B00335EQ0E", "B000FFJYA2", "B0001I561E", "B000BMGEIE", "B00005RDST", "B004PXNXB6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0040QTNSU", "B00003CX9W", "B00003CWPX", "B00004R99B"]}, "price": 44.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 89574}, "asin": "B00004Y7S5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JDY453ZBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Fantasia Anthology (3-Disc Collector's Edition)"}

With a cast that includes Robert Duvall, Angelina Jolie, Delroy Lindo, Cage, and Ribisi, it would be easy to say this story wastes all their talents--which it does, but that's not the point.

Too bad director Dominic Sena (Kalifornia) doesn't come across as more of a gearhead; he seems less interested in fast cars than fast cuts. But is this movie fun? Absolutely, and it's funbecauseit's so stupid.

{"description": "This thoroughly second-rate follow-up to the groundbreaking (and highly profitable) horror flickThe Blair Witch Project--produced byBlair Witchdirectors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez--plays with the notions of reality and fantasy that surrounded the hype of the original movie, and attempts to throw in some scares along the way. A year after the release of the original film, a group of five Blair Witch aficionados--four out-of-towners led by one seriously unhinged \"tour guide\"--venture into the woods outside Burkittsville, Maryland, on a tour of the sites made famous by missing documentarians Heather, Mike, and Josh. After a drunken night of camping out in hopes of communing with the spirit of the Blair Witch, the five wake up to find that their seemingly innocent sleep may have been disturbed somehow. But what exactly happened? If you're expecting suspense of the first degree and a horrifying payoff similar to the one that climaxed the first film, you'll be sorely disappointed. After retreating to an old, run-down broom factory (get it? Broom factory? Blair Witch? Oh well...), the five go over their videotapes of the night in question to get some answers, and basically wind up screaming at each other for the remainder of the film, and shedding some blood along the way. Documentary filmmaker Joe Berlinger (of the highly acclaimedParadise LostandBrother's Keeper) proves that he should definitely stick to nonfiction filmmaking, and the entire cast is grating and unpleasant, aside from a scene-stealing turn by Kim Director as a goth chick with attitude to burn and a no-nonsense approach to this Blair Witch stuff. Strictly for hard-coreBlair Witchfans only, and even then this sequel may prove to disappoint.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00001QGUM", "B00LLAV26O", "B00LMBUR6S", "B002AS45VK", "B00LBFFR2Y", "B0009X763M", "B003Y5H59M", "B00L6AW1K0", "B00AEFYYH6", "B00L9K2EGS", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B000I2J68M", "B00KTFJ5F2", "B00HRCATDW", "B003VE9WP6", "B000A6T1ZY", "B00L3OAS5Y", "B001NPD9LS", "B000099T3M", "B00IQHPS6A", "B001UGGVDI", "B00KUS5YGC", "B002LMSWN2", "B00AEFY31S", "B000MEYJHO", "B00IKM5LFY", "B0006SGYL0", "B00KTFJ50M", "B00006FDBT", "B003L20IEW", "B00006FI0R", "B000FS9FE4", "6305622760", "B000KJU1KK", "B0051GLDQS", "B0000CEB6Y", "B003VA3JUO", "B00HRCBGRA", "B0000AOX09", "B008874968", "B000BTIU4S", "B002VKE1K2", "B00AEFY37C", "B00L22H2IS", "B000BTJDGC", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00005N5RM", "B001B8XRT6", "B00004W4UD", "B002YI9304", "B009AMALGM", "B00GJ7CUFG", "B00AEFYV9W", "B004W48KHK", "B00GNAO70K", "B00000I1KK", "B00K2CHVSK", "B00J81S92S", "B0021L8UFI", "B001P3SA9Y", "B004P7CM9Q", "B00009MGEM", "B005CFBZQ6", "B0056P6SOG", "B00JF5GAIW", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00CERJI5U", "B003Q6D25K", "B00B96TGQS", "B000S0GYRU", "B00BM4Q4H6", "B00005LQ0Z", "B00005JOWW", "B009DA743Y", "B005B0QYMM", "B000A2X3U2", "B00003CWRF", "B000AM6OQ2", "B00AEFY2WI", "B0031U8OEK", "B001MVYUR0", "B000V4UFZK", "B0002C4JJ4", "B000GCFO0I", "B00HRUQ7WG", "B00IXD2MWK", "B0000VCZNE", "B009O07N9I", "B0002KQNL8", "B00AGKH4MG", "B001CT876C", "B001KKU9CI", "B00AEFY2LO", "B00I31COHA", "B000FSME9W", "B000WC3864", "B006P0FD4W", "B000A5045Q", "B008JFUNYG"], "bought_together": ["B00001QGUM", "B00AEFYYH6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00001QGUM", "B000FA57UI", "B00AEFYYH6", "B00BEIYMAG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 91036}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.99, "brand": "", "asin": "B000056T5E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51674ASQWCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Book of Shadows - Blair Witch 2 (DVD + CD)"}

{"description": "AlthoughSunshinewas made by a Hungarian, Istv&aacute;n Szab&oacute;, and deals with the history of Hungary as refracted through three generations of a Jewish-Hungarian family, you might be more inclined to give it three hours of your own life if you approach it as a David Lean movie in spirit. Itisan English-language picture, and Maurice Jarre's music recalls his score forDoctor Zhivago. Szab&oacute; emulates Lean's intimate-epic style of merging the sweep of history with the crystalline detailing of individual lives, so that the shape of destiny is glimpsed through personal moments that feel at once evanescent and eternal. His lighting cameraman, Lajos Koltai, is one of the handful of cinematographers equal to capturing these moments in lapidary images--cinematic sunshine of the highest order.\"Sunshine\" is a literal translation of Sonnenschein, the family name of the central characters. And \"destiny\" is one meaning of Sors, the name three Sonnenschein offspring choose for themselves to better assimilate as subjects of the Austro-Hungarian empire. Two are brothers, Ignatz (Ralph Fiennes) and Gustave (James Frain); their sister (by adoption) Valerie (Jennifer Ehle) is really their cousin. Both men love her, and Ignatz rocks the ultratraditional family by taking her as his wife. Nevertheless, the Sonnenscheins and the Sors enter upon the 20th century in loving solidarity, grateful to live under a liberal and tolerant regime. That's all swept away by the Great War, the rise of Nazism, and its replacement, the new fascism of Stalinist Communism. Valerie survives them all--though she's played later on by Rosemary Harris, Ehle's own mother. For his part--or parts--Ralph Fiennes goes on to embody two later generations of Sonnenschein/Sors men, the proudly patriotic Adam and his son, the rudderless Ivan, whose guilt over being a compliant prisoner at Auschwitz leads him to buy into the passionate puritanism of the Stalinist purges. Fiennes rises to the awesome challenge of creating three utterly distinct characters who all share the same congenital weaknesses and aching potential for greatness.This is a film of considerable beauty and sometimes shattering power. Even three hours is not enough to do justice to all the characters, all the wrenching turnarounds of history and political allegiance and rectitude. But the film is never less than gripping, and as an essay on \"family values,\" it's well-nigh definitive.--Richard T.

{"description": "A powerful coda to what many considered the best show on TV recalls \"Homicide\" at its best: prickly character tensions, sour office politics, raging emotions, and the camaraderie of the squad room. In \"Homicide, the Movie\" that squad room becomes unusually crowded when the entire cast, past and present, converges to hunt for the gunman who shot beloved former shift commander Al Giordello (Yaphet Kotto), now a controversial Baltimore mayoral candidate.\\n The class reunion could have easily turned into a gimmicky series of cameos, and with such a sprawling cast many familiar faces are indeed little more than walk-ons, but the fiercely intelligent script anchors the investigation in the even more anticipated reunion of the tetchy, intense retired detective Frank Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and his former partner, Tim Bayliss (Kyle Secor). Never quite friends yet intimately trusted partners, the relationship of the most compelling duo in the show's history is pushed to the brink as the morally sure Pembleton digs around the guilt that haunts Bayliss in a devastating climax. All the hallmarks of the show are here--the vivid location shooting, the nervous you-are-there camerawork, the effective use of popular music--and the episode comes full circle in a lovely coda in which even the deceased make their appearances. It's an uncompromising piece of American television and a moving end to a great series. \"--Sean Axmaker\"", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007XG4GE", "B00061QJYE", "B002BLNGTS", "B0002NY830", "B00018YCJ6", "B0000C5RPV", "B008JFUNHI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002BLNGTS", "B00008PHCZ", "B00061QJYE", "B0007XG4GE"]}, "price": 109.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 189353}, "asin": "B00005AW04", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/414Q00C6T3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Homicide - The Movie"}
{"description": "Acclaimed Oscar&#xC2;(r)-nominated* director Fran&#xC3;&#xA7;ois Truffaut (Small Change, Day for Night) has created an  absorbing  (Leonard Maltin) film about the true-life tale of a young boy found living alone in the woods of France in the 1700s. Using actual journal entries, Truffaut not only directed and co-wrote the script with Jean Gruault, but also starred as the unflappable Doctor Jean-Marc-Gaspard Itard, the visionary who takes on the incredible task of civilizing The Wild Child.   At The National Institute for the Deaf and Dumb in Paris, a barely clothed and dirty young boy is admitted. Found in a forest, the child is unable to speak, communicate or function in society. Christened Victor by the hospital staff, his case is taken up by Doctor Itard (Truffaut),a lone physician who has an unyielding dedication to re-integrating the lad into society. But the road to tame the beast is a rocky one and Itard will have to work tirelessly to teach Victor how to re-claim his place in the world even if it means staking his reputation on it!  *1974: Dayfor Night", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003VA3JTA", "B000053VBR", "B000053VBS", "B000BC8SWO", "B00008H2GR", "B000053VBQ", "B000087F6L", "B000053VBO", "1572524839", "B003B3O5J0", "B001O549EI", "B000053VBL", "B000E5LEV0", "B001O549F2", "B00008L3ZX", "B000093NR0", "B00HVOFP08", "B00ATK02FO", "B00000JJHK", "B003WKL6YO", "0312423357", "B005KQVE1S", "B002IVDLH8", "B002X9S6RK", "B008SAPCAM", "B00HE010QM", "B000G8NXYG", "0060924659", "B0031SU2Y2", "B001P829VY", "B008Y5OVZ8", "B00005V6N6", "B000BC8SWE", "B00005A8TU", "B001EKP5D2", "B00000IBQ0", "B0009P7EI2", "B00421IR5I", "B00BTYU3SK", "B0050FXDDQ", "B0086AQWR6", "1572522739", "B000YQT81M"], "bought_together": ["B000053VBR", "B003VA3JTA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000053VBR", "B003VA3JTA", "B000053VBS", "B000E5LEV0"]}, "price": 49.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 53699}, "asin": "B00005BKZR", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TNDGDAMWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Wild Child"}

{"description": "A Beautiful Mindmanages to twist enough pathos out of John Nash's incredible life story to redeem an at-times goofy portrayal of schizophrenia. Russell Crowe tackles the role with characteristic fervor, playing the Nobel prize-winning mathematician from his days at Princeton, where he developed a groundbreaking economic theory, to his meteoric rise to the cover ofForbesmagazine and an MIT professorship, and on through to his eventual dismissal due to schizophrenic delusions. Of course, it is the delusions that fascinate director Ron Howard and, predictably, go astray. Nash's other world, populated as it is by a maniacal Department of Defense agent (Ed Harris), an imagined college roommate who seems straight out ofDead Poets Society, and an orphaned girl, is so fluid and scriptlike as to make the viewer wonder if schizophrenia is really as slick as depicted. Crowe's physical intensity drags us along as he works admirably to carry the film on his considerable shoulders. No doubt the story of Nash's amazing will to recover his life without the aid of medication is a worthy one, his eventual triumph heartening.

{"description": "Such a simple idea--yet so fiendishly complex in the execution.24, as surely everyone knows by now, is a thriller that takes places over 24 hours, midnight to midnight, in 24 one-hour episodes (well, 45-minute episodes if you subtract the commercials). Everything takes place in real time, which means no flashbacks, no flash-forwards, no handy time-dissolves. Every strand of the plot has to be dovetailed and interlocked so things happen just when they should, in the right amount of time. Not that easy.Creator Robert Cochran and his team of writers and directors have done an impressive job of putting the jigsaw together and keeping the tension ratcheted up high, as federal agent Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) runs around L.A. trying to stall an assassination attempt on an African American presidential candidate and rescue his wife and daughter from the clutches of the Balkan baddies. Twists, turns, revelations, and cliffhangers are tossed at us with satisfying regularity. It's not perfect: we get some hokey plot devices (instant amnesia, anybody?); the final twist makes no sense whatsoever; there are altogether too many huggy family moments; and as for Dennis Hopper's \"Serbian\" accent....Even so, this is undeniably mold-breaking TV. Sutherland, rescuing his career from the doldrums in one heroic leap, fully deserves his Golden Globe. Sets and locations are artfully deployed, and Sean Callery's score is a powerful, brooding presence. LikeMurder OneandThe Sopranos,24is one of those series that future TV thrillers will be measured against.--Philip Kemp", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008YGRU", "B0002XVQSU", "B000B837XI", "B000ICLRKC", "B000MR8W92", "B001L5SRJE", "B002ZCY7SW", "B000NDEXKW", "B001DMVZOE", "B002ZCY7TG", "B0015QWZ8S", "B0001WHXM0", "B001QE99AQ", "B009LDD1H6", "B000VWC9YW", "B001DJLCRC", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B0075FF5QM", "B000RO6JY0", "B001934SNM", "B0015RRNMA", "B00005JOC9", "B000R9YLKY", "B003145HQY", "B00005JNOG", "B00J5LXT44", "B00KPP6R9S", "B0053O8AKU", "B000Q6GUW0", "B000YABIQ6", "B0044E9JU0", "B00HW3EXCE", "B009MF5BXK", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00BW4S8AC", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B00JL6L4UY", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B00HX0KIAM", "B008CLI4N4", "B000W91RUG", "0553397737", "B00KDK64DY", "B00AIBZMM2"], "bought_together": ["B00008YGRU", "B0002XVQSU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0044E9JU0", "B00008YGRU", "B0002XVQSU", "B00LDCGBNE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18292}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.38, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B00005JLF2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41PB6M8MGRL._SX300_.jpg", "title": "24: Season 1"}

{"description": "There's only one deleted scene in this two-disc DVD set, but it's a doozy. The \"Sgt. Candy Scene\" is a must-see and, unfortunately, the best thing on the second disc. The rushed HBO documentary shows us far more flash than substance. Better is the Visual Effects Lab that goes more in-depth with four sequences, although you need to wade through a hokey interface for each segment. Making your \"own\" effects isn't that much fun; you can only choose a few effects that change in two scenes. Anyone looking to get the complicated backstory of the trilogy figured out should dig into the \"Sky Net Database\" and an intricate timeline. The two commentary tracks are worth a listen, with director Jonathan Mostow's solo track the better one. The director goes into great detail on how the little things (from lighting street scenes to tricks for destroying buildings) count.  The second track is pieced together from the actors recorded separately. Mostow appears with actress Claire Danes (doing her first commentary track) and their chemistry is enjoyable after a slow start. The other actors have less interesting things to say, including Schwarzenegger who is constantly--yet enthusiastically--selling the film.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5", "B001FB55HQ", "B00005JA8B", "B00070FX5U", "B00007AJG4", "B002ZG98LO", "B000T9OP7G", "B002GHHHME", "B00005JKIP", "B002QFYJFY", "B0002J58HO", "B0000AXE8I", "B001AQO43M", "B00AKGG828", "B00026ZG10", "B0001BKAEY", "B00IZZDWKM", "B001451HXO", "B0000VCZK2", "B000056PMU", "B000BPL2FQ", "B000RW3VCK", "B0004Z33F0", "B000U1ZV8K", "B0045HCJGC", "B0004Z33EQ", "B00005JNTU", "B000HRMAPE", "B00008G8M4", "B000RRS7RE", "B00005JKYX", "B0000VD12I", "B000FC2FQA", "B00000ILDG", "B00000G3PA", "B00005JMZK", "B000MGBSE4", "B0087ZG7J8", "B0004Z33EG", "B000P0J0AQ", "B00005JMEW", "B0087ZG7NO", "B00003CXTA", "B0002CHK1S", "B000RJO56E", "B00177YA1K", "B00004STDN", "B005COLETU", "B001AK3S4Y", "B000VNMMR0", "B0000959N0", "B00005JMUA", "1558908846", "6305767866", "B001RIY4WE", "B0049IHX2C", "B000VI70QS", "B000EGDB10", "B002GSXKN8", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B0045HCJ9O", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00005JNJV", "B001451HX4", "B00I9TDMRM", "B0006GANOQ", "B00003CXSP", "6305428115", "B00016MSV2", "B00005JOC9", "B000TJBN80", "B009MO57H6", "B000O77SQS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B001OST0M6", "B005LAIHXQ", "B0002J4X1Q", "B0002V7OI8", "B0015XHP2C", "6304806434", "B000QXDED6", "B00005JL3K", "B008JFUPFI", "B003PIUINS", "0783225946", "0792839056", "B00005N7Z1", "B0006GAO6I", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00005JL78", "B001HN697M", "B00IJS2OXG", "B002NXSRVG", "B00008G8M5", "B00005JN0T", "B003XURDAY", "B000O77SRM", "B006VRRGNK", "B00F4FFO8E"], "bought_together": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5", "B001FB55HQ", "B002JT6AO0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 115564}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.47, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JM0B", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5143TFPX8SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "More sex. More violence. That's what you get in the unrated director's cut ofTaking Lives, which ought to tell you where director D.J. Caruso's priorities lie. The hot scenes between Angelina Jolie and Ethan Hawke are extended (offering a bit more nudity for Jolie's lecherous fans), and the fate of Gena Rowlands's character isconsiderablymore graphic, but none of the added footage makes the movie any better or worse. That said, this cynical director's cut is the only version worth buying if you're looking to fill out your serial-killer-thriller collection (or your movies-in-which-Jolie-gets-naked collection), and you might as well enjoy the gag reel outtakes because they contain the only footage on the entire DVD in which Jolie cracks a genuine smile. The four featurettes are really just one standard-issue promo reel chopped into thematic categories with a pretentiousCSIvibe, and while they offer little of substance, seasoned film buffs will welcome the appearance of veteran British editor Anne V.

{"description": "The Quiet Americanproves that elegant and intelligent filmmaking can be emotionally powerful. Michael Caine plays Thomas Fowler, a British journalist in 1950s Vietnam with a lovely Vietnamese mistress named Phuong  (Do Thi Hai Yen) and a jaded view of the political strife teeming around him. He befriends a seemingly innocuous American named Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser), who falls in love with Phuong--and slowly, Pyle's real purpose in  Vietnam becomes revealed. Fowler finds that, to hold on to the carefully balanced life he's created for himself, he must make choices he's long avoided. Caine and Fraser are both superb and give a human face to complicated politics; as a result,The Quiet Americanmanages to be  compelling as both history and a story about very specific people embroiled in a very personal conflict.

{"description": "There's a pretty good gimmick with these DVD extras aimed squarely at the pre-teen/early teen audience that ate up this film. Each of the extras (a standard making-of featurette, an alternate ending, and an interesting deleted scene) is followed by a clue afterwards. Decipher the clues and unlock the next set of extras: a nice bit on real treasure hunters, an awful piece on the Knights Templar, and one gem for kids: \"Riley Poole's Decode this!\" Actor Justin Bartha reprises his role (Nic Cage's techno-sidekick) and lectures a bit on the cooler side of language history and code-breaking with a few simple interactive games. If you get through it all, you unlock a hidden feature, a trivia track. Thankfully, those who do not want to go on the treasure hunt can access these features by reading the printed insert.

{"description": "Jamie Foxx's uncannily accurate performance isn't the only good thing aboutRay. Riding high on a wave of Oscar buzz, Foxx proved himself worthy of all the hype by portraying blind R&B; legend Ray Charles in a warts-and-all performance that Charles approved shortly before his death in June 2004. Despite a few dramatic embellishments of actual incidents (such as the suggestion that the accidental drowning of Charles's younger brother caused all the inner demons that Charles would battle into adulthood), the film does a remarkable job of summarizing Charles's strengths as a musical innovator and his weaknesses as a philandering heroin addict who recorded some of his best songs while flying high as a kite. Foxx seems to be channeling Charles himself, and as he did with the life of Ritchie Valens in La Bamba, director Taylor Hackford gets most of the period details absolutely right as he chronicles Ray's rise from \"chitlin circuit\" performer in the early '50s to his much-deserved elevation to legendary status as one of the all-time great musicians. Foxx expertly lip-syncs to Ray Charles' classic recordings, but you could swear he's the real deal in a film that honors Ray Charles without sanitizing his once-messy life.--Jeff ShannonMore on Ray CharlesModern Sounds in Country and Western Music(CD)The Genius of Ray Charles(CD)Ray Charles and Betty Carter--Dedicated to You(CD)Genius & Soul--The 50th Anniversary Collection(CD)Ray: A Tribute to the Movie, the Music, and the Man(book)More Albums by Ray Charles", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000E8QVWY", "B001P3SA94", "B00465I1CE", "B00005JKMQ", "6305428409", "B003BV8I3Q", "B00AEFXTKO", "B0002LE9HC", "B000BOH8X2", "B00AEFYG3S", "0790739313", "B000JJSL1W", "B000A50460", "B00005TQ44", "0783230524", "B0009R1TJ0", "0780627822", "B00AEFZ63M", "B000P0J092", "B002VWNICM", "B00EV4EUT8", "B000JLTRH2", "B000N6U0E2", "B0041QSZS8", "0783237367", "078324228X", "B00AEFY6TW", "B003HKN534", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00007AJG1", "B00007L4KF", "B00ANDDBBY", "B000BITV9W", "0783114907", "B00007AJG2", "1558908390", "B00005JLRZ", "B000FVQLQQ", "6305692572", "0767821637", "B002CA68NO", "B00AFEXRME", "B002CPMB9O", "B004SIP93S", "B000063JDI", "B00005NB8K", "B00125WAWS", "6305505780", "B000IFRT4W", "B001TUZGPO", "B009NNM9OA", "B000RB6XG2", "B000P0J0CY", "B0001FR3IQ", "B000FVQLRA", "B00066FAVW", "B002XMGGK6", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00DW5IL2E", "B00005JPK8", "0767811070", "B000I0QL7I", "B000069I0E", "B00080ZG10", "0306814315", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00049QQHI", "B00000JGHV", "B0007CEXYK", "B0001Q4BOE", "B0000YEE6M", "B000NIVJF4", "B008Y1YJN6", "B00066VTU8", "B001132GNY", "B0006QAIG4", "B0034G4OSG", "B000C20VRS", "0800141741", "B00A2H9QN8", "B000Y11B8K", "B00005LB86", "B000056VP4", "B00005JL72", "B000095J01", "B000Q7ZNZ4", "B002CAWNEM", "B003UESJHO", "B00066FAQW", "0783230389", "B0013FDM7E", "B00007ELEO", "B00AMEZDJW", "B000P0J0CE", "B003Y5H4ZC", "0767821955", "B00003GPFT", "B0021L8V2A"], "bought_together": ["B000E8QVWY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002LE9HC", "B000E8QVWY", "B000BOH8X2", "B00AZMFJYA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17277}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.89, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JND5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41RQ8ETK19L._SX300_.jpg", "title": "Ray (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Batman Beginsdiscards the previous four films in the series and recasts the Caped Crusader as a fearsome avenging angel. That's good news, because the series, which had gotten off to a rousing start under Tim Burton, had gradually dissolved into self-parody by 1997'sBatman & Robin. As the title implies,Batman Beginstells the story anew, when Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) flees Western civilization following the murder of his parents. He is taken in by a mysterious instructor named Ducard (Liam Neeson in another mentor role) and urged to become a ninja in the League of Shadows, but he instead returns to his native Gotham City resolved to end the mob rule that is strangling it. But are there forces even more sinister at hand?Cowritten by the team of David S. Goyer (a veteran comic book writer) and director Christopher Nolan (Memento),Batman Beginsis a welcome return to the grim and gritty version of the Dark Knight, owing a great debt to the graphic novels that preceded it. It doesn't have the razzle dazzle, or the mass appeal, ofSpider-Man 2(though the Batmobile is cool), and retelling the origin means it starts slowly, like most \"first\" superhero movies. But it's certainly the best Bat-film since Burton's original, and one of the best superhero movies of its time. Bale cuts a good figure as Batman, intense and dangerous but with some of the lightheartedness Michael Keaton brought to the character. Michael Caine provides much of the film's humor as the family butler, Alfred, and as the love interest, Katie Holmes (Dawson's Creek) is surprisingly believable in her first adult role. Also featuring Gary Oldman as the young police officer Jim Gordon, Morgan Freeman as a Q-like gadgets expert, and Cillian Murphy as the vile Jonathan Crane.--David HoriuchiBatmanat Amazon.comAllBatmanDVDsBatman Begins101: A Comic Book PrimerWhere Have I Seen Christian Bale?AllBatmanComics and Graphic NovelsBatmanToysBatman BeginsSoundtrackStills fromBatman Begins(click for larger images)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA", "B002GSXKN8", "B000P0J06U", "B001OST0LW", "B000P0J06K", "B004EPZ07K", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00005JKCH", "B001GCUO1Q", "B002ZG980U", "B001OST0M6", "B008JFUPFI", "B004LWZWFQ", "B00005JMQW", "B004LWZW42", "B000VI70QS", "B001DHXT20", "B000M341QE", "B0000959N0", "B000UR9T8C", "B00005JNTU", "B000AYELVA", "B00E5I2M6I", "B002IPFWTE", "B000HEVZ9E", "B0090SI56Y", "B002HWRYJE", "B0006L0LOS", "B000OVLBF8", "B00003CWT6", "B000VR0570", "B00E5I2MEK", "B000HCO83Q", "B0007P0Y7C", "B008JFUO72", "B00F4FFO8E", "B001CDR1FG", "B000P0J0EW", "B002T9H2LA", "B0002KVUKM", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00005N5S5", "B0083SBMBM", "B0001BKAEY", "B00AQSN7HE", "B000J10EQU", "B00005JKZY", "B002NXSRVG", "B000AYELVU", "B001OQCV6A", "B004LWZW4M", "B001VLBDD0", "B001GZ6QEC", "B004GJYRA0", "B007REV4T8", "B001TK80C0", "B000HRJLII", "B001QTXM5Y", "B005G4TJUC", "B00005JKZV", "B0053FANT0", "B00005JA8B", "B003YAR97K", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00001ZWUS", "B004EPYZQC", "B001N44BVQ", "B006VRRGNK", "B001AEF6HM", "B00000JQB5", "B00011CZRE", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00AEFY0F2", "B007K3JFUQ", "B0002IQMAM", "B00005JN0T", "B002SJIO4A", "B000VWYJ86", "B0013FDM7E", "B00005JNTI", "B00407PNY2", "B00DTPRZ24", "B008JFUS0U", "B00004Z4WR", "B000FS9FCG", "B000QXDED6", "B0085A9HU6", "0780624890", "B00005LOUK", "B000065U1N", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005JN5T", "B001QB9H1U", "B00005JMUA", "0792844890", "B0007DFJ0G", "B004EPYZSK", "B008JFUOWM", "B00AEFY5B6"], "bought_together": ["B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009JBWOU0", "B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA", "B002ZG980U"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7806}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.99, "brand": "DC Comics", "asin": "B00005JNJV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518zjc4XtzL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Batman Begins (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Despite super effects, a huge budget, and the cinematic pedigree of alien-happy Steven Spielberg, this take on H.G. Wells's novel is basically a horror film packaged as a sci-fi thrill ride. Instead of a mad slasher, however, Spielberg (along with writers Josh Friedman & David Koepp) utilizes aliens hell-bent on quickly destroying humanity, and the terrifying results that prey upon adult fears, especially in the post-9/11 world. The realistic results could be a new genre, the grim popcorn thriller; often you feel like you're watching Schindler's List more than Spielberg's other thrill-machine movies (Jaws,Jurassic Park). The film centers on Ray Ferrier, a divorced father (Tom Cruise, oh so comfortable) who witnesses one giant craft destroy his New Jersey town and soon is on the road with his teen son (Justin Chatwin) and preteen daughter (Dakota Fanning) in tow, trying to keep ahead of the invasion. The film is, of course, impeccably designed and produced by Spielberg's usual crew of A-class talent. The aliens are genuinely scary, even when the film--like the novel--spends a good chunk of time in a basement. Readers of the book (or viewers of the deft 1953 adaptation) will note the variation of whom and how the aliens come to Earth, which poses some logistical problems. The film opens and closes with narration from the novel read by Morgan Freeman, but Spielberg could have adapted Orson Welles's words from the famous Halloween Eve 1938 radio broadcast: \"We couldn't soap all your windows and steal all your garden gates by tomorrow night, so we did the best next thing: we annihilated the world.\"--Doug ThomasWar of the Worldsat Amazon.comThe SoundtrackThe War of the Worlds(1953)War of the Worlds - The Complete First Season(TV series)Classic Sci-Fi Movies and Their RemakesAliens Invade on DVDThe Prog-rock Opera (no kidding)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B00005JL78", "B001SGEUYW", "B00008G8M4", "B00005JL3T", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AEFXNLY", "B00005JMXX", "B001OQCV2E", "B000VECAD0", "B002O3Z510", "B0002V7OI8", "B000H30B2C", "B000EGDB10", "B00005JN2Z", "B005LAIIMG", "B005PTYP70", "B002O3Z50G", "B0002V7ON8", "B00005JN0T", "B00K2CHW48", "B002SJIO4A", "0783225547", "B008JFUO36", "B00005JKLZ", "B00AS1Q93S", "1936594056", "B004EPYZUS", "B001TUZG4K", "B00AEFXR1K", "B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFXYJA", "0767817478", "B0034G4ORC", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00070FX5U", "B0045HCJSA", "B00000G3PA", "B005LAIHPE", "B003Y5H5GK", "B00AEBBA72", "B00003CWU3", "B00I9TDMRM", "B001ECDVKE", "B00003CXXP", "B000V4UFZK", "B0010X73ZG", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00005JKFR", "B000XT1P4S", "B003HKN52U", "B0009PW4D2", "B000HRMAPE", "B004EPYZPS", "B0018QPPXW", "B0002WZTOI", "B00AEBB9LO", "B004LWZW4M", "B003ABZHAO", "B003YJFALS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B000OT6V64", "B004P7CN7W", "B000CCBC9O", "B00000ILDD", "0767803434", "B001L57ZYM", "B000065V3G", "B007STBUHI", "B002ZG980U", "B008JFUQZ2", "B00005B6JZ", "B0006GANOQ", "B000F1IQN2", "1494343576", "B001GCUO02", "B00004Y87O", "0783226810", "B004EPYZSK", "B000P0J0BU", "B005LAIHXQ", "B001680M26", "B000EQHXN2", "B0045HCJFS", "B00004BZIY", "B00008G8M5", "B00003CXQA", "B008JFUS0U", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00EIN6KJ0", "B0000DZ6N3", "B000MV8A9A", "B00005JKYX", "B0000YEEGM", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B0013FCWUW", "B002ZG9864", "B00003CWTI", "B008MIMWQW", "B00IKM5OCO"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBB8VK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B004LWZW4M", "B00005JL78", "B004EPYZSK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18739}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JNTI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51upxzPRnXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "War of the Worlds"}
{"description": "With the slimmest extras package for a Pixar film debuting on DVD,Carsstill shines for home viewing. As with earlier digital-to-digital transfers, the film sounds and looks stunning. There is only one behind-the-scenes feature, a 16-minute cursory but entertaining glance at director John Lasseter's influences (his dad was a car-parts manager), including some of the real-life inspiration for the film such as Michael Wallis's influential book on Route 66 (he also voiced the sheriff). There's a new cartoon for the DVD, \"Mater and Ghost Light,\" which is smile-inducing at best. Four deleted scenes (in storybook format with voices) also show a darker tone the movie may have taken at one point. Best is the adorable short \"One Man Band\" that showed theatrically with the film, and the film's credit sequence can be seen full screen without the credits (and find the Easter egg for an extended version).

{"description": "Nearly 20 years after riding his last Crusade, Harrison Ford makes a welcome return as archaeologist/relic hunter Indiana Jones inIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, an action-packed fourth installment that's, in a nutshell, less memorable than the first three but great nostalgia for fans of the series. Producer George Lucas and screenwriter David Koepp (War of the Worlds) set the film during the cold war, as the Soviets--replacing Nazis as Indy's villains of choice and led by a sword-wielding Cate Blanchett with black bob and sunglasses--are in pursuit of a crystal skull, which has mystical powers related to a city of gold. After escaping from them in a spectacular opening action sequence, Indy is coerced to head to Peru at the behest of a young greaser (Shia LaBeouf) whose friend--and Indy's colleague--Professor Oxley (John Hurt) has been captured for his knowledge of the skull's whereabouts. Whatever secrets the skull holds are tertiary; its reveal is the weakest part of the movie, as the CGI effects that inevitably accompany it feel jarring next to the boulder-rolling world of Indy audiences knew and loved. There's plenty of comedy, delightful stunts--ants play a deadly role here--and the return ofRaiderslove interest Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood, once shrill but now softened, giving her ex-love bemused glances and eye-rolls as he huffs his way to save the day. Which brings us to Ford: bullwhip still in hand, he's a little creakier, a lot grayer, but still twice the action hero of anyone in film today. With all the anticipation and hype leading up to the film's release, perhaps no reunion is sweeter than that of Ford with the role that fits him as snugly as that fedora hat.--Ellen A.

{"description": "Alas! The fifthHarry Potterfilm has arrived. The time is long past that this can be considered a simple \"children's\" series--though children and adults alike will enjoy it immensely. Starting off from the dark and tragic ending of the fourth film,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenixbegins in a somber and angst-filled tone that carries through the entire 138 minutes (the shortest of anyHPmovie despite being adapted from the longest book). Hopes of winning the Quidditch Cup have been replaced by woes like government corruption, distorted media spin, and the casualties of war. As the themes have matured, so have the primary characters' acting abilities. Ron (Rupert Grint), Hermione (Emma Watson), and especially Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) are more convincing than ever--in roles that are more demanding.Harry is deeply traumatized from having witnessed Cedric Diggory's murder, but he will soon find that this was just another chapter in the continuing loss he will endure. Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) has returned and, in an attempt to conceal this catastrophe from the wizarding public, the Ministry of Magic has teamed up with the wizard newspaperThe Daily Prophetto smear young Potter and wise Dumbledore (Michael Gambon)--seemingly the only two people in the public eye who believe the Dark Lord has returned. With no one else to stand against the wicked Death Eaters, the Hogwarts headmaster is forced to revive his secret anti-Voldemort society, the Order of the Phoenix. This welcomes back characters like Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson), kind Remus Lupin (David Thewlis), fatherly Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), and insidious Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), and introduces a short list of intriguing new faces. In the meantime, a semi-psychotic bureaucrat from the Ministry (brilliantly portrayed by Imelda Staunton) has seized power at Hogwarts, and Harry is forced to form a secret society of his own--lest the other young wizards at his school be left ill-equipped to defend themselves in the looming war between good and evil. In addition, Harry is filled with an inexplicable rage that only his Godfather Sirius seems to be able to understand.This film, though not as frightening as its predecessor, earns its PG-13 rating mostly because of the ever-darkening tone.  As always, the loyal fans of J.K. Rowling's books will suffer huge cuts from the original plot and character developments, but make no mistake: this is agoodmovie.--Jordan ThompsonOn the DVDThe second disc ofThe Order of the Phoenixfeatures \"The Hidden Secrets of Harry Potter,\" a retrospective on the series so far, with \"Potter experts\" (i.e., people who run fan sites) weighing in on what's to come. This must have been filmed during production, because all their speculation about the conclusion of the saga is clearly dated and therefore superfluous (sinceOrderreleased theatrically at the same time as the seventh book, one would've expected a more current analysis). Many of the deleted scenes are mostly extensions, with the exception of one hilarious take of Professor Trelawney (Emma Thompson) trying--unsuccessfully--to eat gracefully during Dolores Umbridge's introduction at Hogwarts. The chatty actress Natalia Tena, who plays Tonks, gives a tour of the set in \"Trailing Tonks,\" even playing a Christmas song she wrote on her guitar, and director David Yates and editor Mark Day demonstrate editing 101 with a feature that lets you edit your own scene from the movie. Watch the feature but skip the self-editing part; the controls are too complicated to navigate and too frustrating to work properly (plus, hit the wrong button and you've gone all the way back to the beginning). A digital copy of the movie is also included on the bonus disc.--Ellen A.

{"description": "Produced by World Wrestling Entertainment mogul Vince McMahon,See No Evila standard-issue death-fest designed for maximum gross-out appeal, and in that sense it delivers the goods with crushed heads, multiple eye-gougings, throat-rippings and other grisly fates that gore fans will want to discover for themselves. If your idea of a good time is watching a mangy dog urinate into the vacant eye socket of a corpse, this is just the movie for you! In an attempt to create a new horror icon like Freddy Krueger or Jason Voorhees, former porno director Gregory Dark and less-than-stellar screenwriter Dan Madigan have dreamed up a routine plot that's hardly original, but deviously addictive to anyone who digs this kind of stuff: Eight troubled and not-very-bright teens, fresh out of a detention center, are given a second chance when they're taken to the decrepit, filthy Blackwell Hotel and told to clean the place up so it can be turned into a homeless shelter. What they don't know is that the hotel hides a secret, axe-wielding resident named Jacob Goodnight (played by WWE superstar Glen \"Kane\" Jacobs) who's got a knack for plucking the eyeballs from his hapless and ill-fated victims. He's basically an evil kid in the hulking body of a wrestler (call it type-casting, if you will), andSee No Evilis more sick than scary as Jacob does his handiwork, which includes the rather hilarious and grimly ironic dispatch of an animal rights activist, to name just one item in the movie's smorgasbord of splatter. At a brisk 85 minutes, the movie's over before you can work up any genuine terror. Still, a sequel seems likely (even if it's straight-to-video), and devoted horror fans will want to check it out.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B001LPWGC8", "B00009ZPU3", "B003L20IF6", "B000SM6FKY", "B002S0OB8W", "B0021L8UG2", "B001053038", "B001QB9H2E", "B000RGN2IY", "B001B1876G", "B002NPY7F4", "B0029XFN94", "B001R10BIC", "B002DKGWSO", "B00546031G", "B004SEUJVO", "B003PBYSTA", "B004RQDWIU", "B003Y5H4SY", "B002QVFOOI", "B000I5XOV4", "B00275EHDW", "B005LS4MUA", "B00005JOWW", "B003C5FMJE", "B003Q6D282", "B000KX0HH8", "B005DCJ218", "B004SIP9GK", "B004634VFM", "B0021L8UHQ", "B001AQMBHI", "B000HCO80E", "B001RHGRSY", "B00194XBPW", "B0029O0BMC", "B004CJB0A4", "B0021L8UQ2", "B001MFNB4E", "B003Y5H5G0", "B000EWBKLC", "B000O5B4CE", "B00LLAV26O", "B002JT69IM", "B0058O1FNO", "B002CVQAX6", "B002CVQAXQ", "B001FBJUXG", "B005DCJ1J6", "B00AIBZL14", "B001MVYUQQ", "B004GGQMUQ", "B008XAT118", "B0029O0BJU", "B004LOUD80", "B002NPY7EU", "B003H9LIRA", "B004BLTNL6", "B001M9ELP8", "B0021L8UXK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002QVFOOI", "B0057YUV6C", "B00E8RK5OC", "B000UJ48UO"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JOZS", "imUrl": "http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-site/icons/no-img-sm._CB192198896_.gif", "title": "See no Evil Art Prints &amp; Posters"}

{"description": "Another of those cut-and-paste comedies from Adam Sandler's production company starring one of Sandler's erstwhileSaturday Night Livecolleagues,The Adventures of Joe Dirtfinds the magnificently caustic David Spade emasculated by a sentimental script and shapeless, haphazard cutting. Spade plays the title character, a white-trash orphan in search of the parents who abandoned him at the Grand Canyon. The humor is supposed to come from Joe's misadventures, his redneck gullibility, and his encounters with such figures as a serial killer, a wacked-out janitor (Christopher Walken), and a lovable gal (Jamie Pressly) who may, unfortunately, turn out to be his sister. But the squishier requirements of the story, requiring the audience to feel deeply for the pain of Spade's caricature, are an irritant and force Spade to veer from the nastier stuff he does so well.

{"description": "Released two years later than originally scheduled, \"Town & Country\" was plagued by the kind of negative buzz that few movies recover from. Like the infamous \"Ishtar\", this Warren Beatty-led ensemble comedy is ungainly and erratic, but when it's funny it's quite funny, and the involvement of cowriter Buck Henry makes it a lot smarter than most of what passes for wit in postmillennial comedy. An updated sex farce fueled by modern-day foibles, the movie's also an apologetic valentine from notorious womanizers like Beatty, who, as wealthy Manhattan architect Porter Stoddard, is paying the price for his dalliance with a sexy cellist (Nastassja Kinski). While Porter's wife (Diane Keaton) fumes with suspicion, their best friends Mona (Goldie Hawn) and Griffin (Garry Shandling) wage their own marital warfare after Mona spies Griffin with a gorgeous redhead. Mona shouldn't believe what she sees, but she still has cause to worry.\\n   Porter also has a fling with a ski-bunny psycho (Andie MacDowell) with an obsessively protective father (Charlton Heston), and a store clerk (Jenna Elfman) with a thing for Russian literature. It all leads to comedic acts of contrition, but too many gags are strained or flat; lacking knowledge of its troubled history, you'd still think \"Town & Country\" was a puzzle with missing pieces. And yet, these veteran stars somehow pull it together just enough to make it work, and with the stammering Shandling as a standout, the movie boasts a few noteworthy highlights. Heston's a riot (believe it or not), and although \"Town & Country\" doesn't fire on all pistons, it's got enough horsepower to suggest it could've been a contender. \"--Jeff Shannon\"", "related": {"also_bought": ["076784744X", "B00AEFYT94", "B00AEFXYOA", "B0037QGRVK", "B001EKP5D2", "B000NQRR1G", "B00028HBIE", "B00AEFYRJQ", "B0002DRDBY", "B0088X7Z6S", "6305531293", "B001THIQG8", "B000UPMZ3K", "B0007ZEOCS", "6305692688", "B002ZG98FU", "B000V6LSOA", "B001DF6816", "B000062XE6", "B00GSBNFP2", "B00GMV8KGW", "B00441GYRE", "B000F6ZIII", "B00AEFYT1W", "0783227396", "B003EYVXXC", "B00BTYRB58", "B0009UZG3C", "6305657947", "0783230583", "B002XDR5NM", "B0001AVZA8", "B0007IO6NM", "B00AEFYHVO", "B00005N5S5", "B000067D1V", "B004BVS2BS", "B000EHT4EM"], "bought_together": ["076784744X", "B00AEFXYOA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EHT4EM", "6305236569", "B0088X7Z6S"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 114804}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.99, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005NRNT", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CRMWA98NL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Town and Country"}

{"description": "To createRobotech(1985), the early sci-fi epic that helped to  foster an audience for Japanese animation in America, producers at  Harmony Gold edited together three unrelated series:Super  Dimension Fortress: Macross,Genesis Climber Mospeada, andSuper Dimensional Cavalry Southern Cross.  \"Dana's Story,\" which begins theRobotech Masters(Southern Cross) adventure, opens 15 years after the previous episode ended. The daughter of Earthling Max Sterling and Zentraedi pilot Miriya (who married in episode 25), spunky Dana Sterling quickly becomes a squadron commander during the Second Robotech War. Serving with her are brooding musician Bowie Grant, corps Casanova Sean Philips, and no-nonsense Marie Crystal. The Robotech Masters attack Earth, hoping to recapture the mysterious Protoculture factory, which was hidden in the flying fortress SDF-1 centuries earlier: they need the Protoculture to maintain control over their oligarchic civilization. But the Masters cannot control Zor Prime, a clone of the inventor of Protoculture, whom Dana captures. This interplanetary struggle is complicated by the mutual attraction between Bowie and the alien Musica, \"the Mistress of the Cosmic Harp.\" TheRobotech Mastersstory line is as convoluted as theMacrosscontinuity, the pacing as slow and the dialogue as wooden. American viewers either love or hateRobotech, with little middle ground. The supplementary disc offers less material than the previous three: openings and closings of the component series, galleries of model sheets and comic book covers, and two clips in five languages.

{"description": "The 18 episodes that comprise the first broadcast season ofRanmaoffer an appropriately zany introduction to the popular transgender martial arts comedy. These episodes form a single extended narrative, unlike the OVA installments, which can be watched in any order. The pacing is a little slower, the violent martial arts encounters are more clearly staged, and there's more nudity, but the mixture of slapstick humor and reluctant sentiment remains the same. When the Saotomes join the dojo-home of the Tendo family, fathers Genma and Suon decide son Ranma and daughter Akane are engaged, despite the participants' objections. Ranma and Genma have to explain why they turn into a girl and a panda when hit with cold water--the result of a disastrous visit to the cursed springs of Jusenkyo. Before they can establish any semblance of domestic tranquility, the geographically challenged Ryoga arrives to continue a quarrel with Ranma that dates back to junior high school. It's taken him this long to find Furinkan High. Kuno, the school kendo champion and windbag, discovers he's as smitten with Ranma's female form as he is with Akane, while his loudmouth sister Kodachi falls for Ranma as a male. Shampoo the Chinese Amazon is equally dedicated to killing girl-type Ranma and marrying boy-type Ranma. When the overwrought Suon Tendo tells Genma, \"With you and your son in the house, there's never a dull moment,\" he makes a rare understatement. Not rated; suitable for ages 12 and up: Slapstick violence, nudity, mildly risqu&eacute; humor.--Charles Solomon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000PE0GZU", "B0000640VB", "B000067J2W", "B000QXDG9S", "B00006LPGU", "B000094J7H", "B000T28G3M", "6304937296", "B0000A9GLJ", "B0016AK36O", "B0000C52F4", "B0012EM5HY", "6305103429", "B000WW1YO2", "B00JKT5PSY", "B009L0H4H2", "B00HFBZB9M", "B008NNY9HQ", "1591160634", "6305813027", "B00G0OM3EG", "B00J49R0Z6", "B00HR736AA", "1569319626", "B000CCZRBI", "B00GS19OOS", "B00HR3705Q", "B00I462XJS", "B009B82E2E", "B00ANDGYO0", "1591160626", "B00II50JLE", "B00GS18CK0", "B007BMIG5G", "B00576U9GC", "B008YRL7FI", "B00009L53V", "B001F2U700", "B000F6ZIFQ", "B00HFC7LYO", "B00ANDEL3Q", "B001K98M4Q", "B004STBFBM", "B00ANDPGFI", "B00ANDPGI0", "B000FHAT5Y", "B00BLQRFSM", "B00FA97P2W", "B00393SFW0", "1569319634", "B002HW5G2Q", "B004TP55T8", "B00F9DQ73W", "B009OAZG7Y", "B004G9UXEY", "B0071LEH14", "1591160642", "B00GSTHBS6", "B00DHS8MUM", "B00BCPOFPS", "B008NNY9JY", "B00ANDBWXS", "B00AIQD5H6", "B006O94DLI", "B0083SJFYS", "B00F9F7MKC", "B008U1AOKM", "B00BCPOFQ2", "B002MXZYDG", "B00AX0LKXS", "B005SH647S", "B009OAWMIK", "B0030ZOYPO", "B009AVC922", "B0000APVFI", "B0083QJW84", "B004LBA07M", "B0002TSZME", "B001C4ZQEI", "B00ENNBZ68", "B00A830748", "B00HXEWFUY", "B00CDV4JG0", "1591162866", "B002FG9N64", "B00AFEYCLY", "B00D09B0D4", "B003NF97M6", "B00CU6WBFE", "B003VOVW90", "B00005KANZ", "B005HE4AIW", "B009RZ890M", "B001D265RQ", "B00G15MWSG", "B000EJ9VO8", "B008YRL6V8", "B001YYQ9SS", "B0000C52HH", "B005HVWW3K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00GSTHCSK", "B00GSTHBS6", "B000PHC9FM", "1421565943"]}, "price": 29.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 219881}, "asin": "B00005QCW0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518BB6V61KL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ranma 1/2 - The Digital Dojo - The Complete First Season (Box Set)"}
{"description": "If you're looking for a different kind of anime,Sakura Diariesmight just fit the bill. It's a clever, quirky romantic comedy spiced up with lots of goofy humor and a splash of R-rated eroticism. Tuoma Inaba is your average country-boy loose in the big city. He arrives in Tokyo to take his college entrance exams, but Tuoma's not too bright and he fails them all. In short order our hero enrolls in a cram school, poses as a student at the prestigious Keio University in order to pursue one beautiful girl, and moves in with another--his cousin Urara who has a huge crush on him. Then things start to get complicated. This collector's edition contains all 12 episodes ofSakura Diaries. Because it is based on an uncensored version of the Japanese original, there are several differences between it and the earlier multivolume release on VHS and DVD. The plot remains essentially the same, but there's more nudity and newly translated subtitles, and there is no English dub. If you already own the earlier edition and don't care about a few extra seconds of skin, you probably don't need the collector's edition, but for completists and those new toSakura Diaries, this is the definitive version.--Simon Leake", "related": {"also_bought": ["B007V9ECWU", "B00GS1JRPY", "B0081AWUI6", "B005NQ5LM8", "B00HXEWDDS", "B00CU6WBFE", "B0002ZYE5U", "B00114UUMW", "B0002C4JGW", "B008YRL7JE", "B00CU6WBMW", "B003VOVW90", "B0043988G2", "B0001Z3HRW", "B00D39UQ2W", "B001N2WJ1W", "B00EKGX4GW", "B008UQURWM", "B000BRBA7E", "B0023S4A12", "B00HXEWFUY", "B0049TC8C6", "B00A8306US", "B0010358CQ", "B000KJU1LE", "B003H6KRM0", "B0030ZOYIQ", "B005W2BWSA", "B004XC5LPA", "B0083QJW7A", "B001PSUM04", "B001QUXNMA", "B003NE8B5Q", "B001VKSPUU", "B000AARKF8", "B001F2U714", "B000056MWR", "B000063JZE", "B00005TPCD", "B008AX7SP4", "B00004Y9PW", "B000066IXV", "B000P6R5KC", "B000MV8AO0", "B004VRK4BS", "B002W981QM", "B0006SSQWU", "B001GTFP18", "B002CWKTR8", "B007V2LN10", "6305858357", "B00A3TFJ18", "B002CWKTQE", "B0000C52FN", "B00000I1SE", "B0010HOZKI", "B009RG4LBM", "B00BKBCDRQ", "B002FOQY36", "B007USWCWO", "B00DSAUK9U", "B000T4T8Z0", "B004JST244", "B000ADKWM8", "B00441GYWE", "B000NIBUXU", "B0030BOCFK", "B000095J66", "B00HQI72WS", "B002EP8TT8", "B00006CY43", "B00B04KVOA", "B0055CAITQ", "B000CEV396", "B00007JZO2", "B00006CY4F", "B00006CY41", "B003CP62DY", "B004FZWDRO", "B00008NGC0", "B006XDU7X8", "B00127R2WO", "B000G73USQ", "B000BPL2JW", "B000A2XA5K", "B000ASATK8", "B00B2TUCBA", "B000F2CAHE", "B000JU8H6U", "B0048EAYR8", "B000ADKWNW", "B000JJ4F8U", "B000JJ4F9E", "B002FOQXSC", "B000VKL6RU", "B008KZX7QQ", "B002P8LK68", "B006VXG6XA", "B0041420O0", "B0039UAA7Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007BMIGII", "B005NQ5LM8", "B007V9ECWU", "B009SQWOHY"]}, "price": 15.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 63334}, "asin": "B00005QFDT", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51A12G3HCCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sakura Diaries - Complete Series Collector's Edition"}

When Hugo contrived a diabolical scheme to sow the seeds of mistrust between \"O\" and Desi, it sets in motion a disturbing chain of events which erupts into a firestorm of breathtaking intensity.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00B6OEEKQ", "B000QGE8IS", "B0012EM5CE", "B00AMEZDJW", "B004SIP83Y", "B00447L4KA", "B00004Y2R1", "1586638521", "B00063MC1Q", "B00443FMKM", "0743288513", "B00080ZGHO", "B000K7VHLY", "B00003CY5P", "B000Q7ZNZ4", "B000063JZQ", "6305907110", "B00005JLCI", "B000083C6I", "B00005JPK8", "B00AMEZDPG", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00CDV4JNS", "B000AMMSDU", "B00005JLG1", "B000069I0E", "B004M9ZI0M", "B004P7CN7W", "630514415X", "B0000797IO", "B00008G7UG", "B00000JL7T", "B000EWBKI0", "B000Y11B8K", "B00AZL310A", "B00019072G", "B0038RSJ0U", "B000E6ESKS", "B00AEFYAC0", "B000ALAT64", "B00003W8NT", "B00003CXGG", "1561375209", "B00013RC2K", "B000035P5I", "B00DW5IKYS", "6305505780", "B0013D8LNG", "1558908390", "B002CA68NO", "B00AQ5908C", "B004P7CMZ0", "B000K2UVZM", "B002CA68N4", "B004SIP9X8", "B000PE0GRI", "0521618762", "B00013F2S6", "B002ZG99RW", "B001TUZGPO", "B00079HZUM", "B00007L4KF", "B000P0J092", "B00013RC7K", "B001TR4G6W", "B0000AC8LH", "B00AEBB8R4", "B00000JGHV", "B00111YM5Q", "B0059XTUR2", "B00ECR7KX2", "B000BITV9W", "6305428409", "B00B1E6EAY", "B00005JKWM", "B000NO3DLG", "B002GHHK3U", "B0068MNO4S", "1561375217", "B001132GNY", "B00AEFYE08", "0764120581", "B000A2XAQ4", "B00003CWN3", "B00005K3OS", "B000EXZFCQ", "B00007KQ9Y", "B0021L8UPS", "B0013FSL1Q", "B0021L8V2A", "B0002TVWYW", "B00005JD5J", "B00008EY60", "6305428271", "0743288491", "B00E1HIXA2", "B0041QSZS8", "B000NO39FG", "B008H6GHE2", "B0018RNF60"], "bought_together": ["B00B6OEEKQ", "B000QGE8IS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00B6OEEKQ", "B00447L4KA", "B004SIP83Y", "B000QGE8IS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 90208}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 29.99, "brand": "Lions Gate", "asin": "B00005U8EL", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51S3R74BDCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "O (Two-Disc Special Edition)"}
{"description": "Third time is not quite the charm for Eddie Murphy's Axel Foley when he heads for L.A. once again to avenge a friend's murder. This time he's off to the Disneyesque WonderWorld, apparently the most hazardous theme park in America despite an army of shady security agents. John Landis directed Murphy in his first film hit,Trading Places, and would seem a good match for this mix of action and comedy, but his sense of fun only emerges in a few scenes (chubby mechanics do a gymnastic Blues Brothers number to a Diana Ross tune) and his action direction is sloppy and shockingly violent. It seems wrong for the comic tone, and Murphy should have his foul mouth washed out with soap. On the plus side, Bronson Pinchot returns as Serge and all but upstages Murphy in two brief but hilarious scenes.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005U5A8", "B00005JKCB", "B00000I1JZ", "B000MGBSE4", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00AEFXBG6", "B00AEBB99Q", "B00BTYRB2G", "6304806450", "B004QXJZYO", "B000U1ZV8K", "B00005N5SA", "0790738953", "B000O78KW4", "B00004STUL", "B00005N5SB", "6305428441", "B00AEFY6TW", "B001TK80C0", "B00AEBB9AA", "B000FO0A9W", "B000069I1H", "B009WGYXIS", "B000CEV3M8", "B0006J28MI", "B00003CY5Y", "B001VLBDD0", "B00006FDBT", "B0001VTPW2", "B00029NMRM", "0790732149", "B0001VTPWC", "0790731924", "0790742012", "B000WGYMTC", "0767803434", "1558908404", "B000O77SRM", "0783227396", "B00005JL72", "B00005IBN0", "B0000639EX", "0783222149", "6305213283", "6305213305", "B001FB55HQ", "B004WJT5E2", "B00005QT9P", "B000FO0AA6", "B000YGDNPO", "B000065V3E", "B001AV3BYK", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000FI8MPW", "B001B3LIOC", "6304712987", "B002AS466O", "B000063UR3", "B002GHHHL0", "B000055Y0Y", "B0009X760U", "B000BBOUW2", "B00008977B", "B00005N5S5", "0783225539", "0780624890", "1558908846", "B0045HCIYA", "B004SIP9P6", "B00005JNTI", "B008G4T7W4", "B001NPD9LS", "B00004Z4WR", "B00AEFYDM2", "B004XQO8JG", "B00003GPFT", "B00AEFXPYY", "6304806434", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B002GHHHME", "B00AEFXPG2", "0790736411", "B00006HAWN", "B0006D3HGA", "B000VNMMR0", "B00008G8M4", "B005GT3X68", "B002O3Z50G", "B00000IQW2", "B0045HCJFS", "B00026ZG10", "B003AWRMCE", "B00008WFU4", "B00HW3L9MG", "0790732238", "B000WTVZGC", "B00BTYSIWI", "B00008DDXA", "B002ZG98LO", "B0000696HX"], "bought_together": ["B00005U5A8", "B00005JKCB"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JKCB", "B00005U5A8", "B000MGBLSC", "B00AEBB99Q"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 79172}, "asin": "B00005U5A9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ARS42GDAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Beverly Hills Cop III"}

{"description": "Robotech(1985), the early sci-fi epic that helped to foster an audience for Japanese animation in America, was created by the producers at Harmony Gold, who edited together the unrelated seriesSuper Dimension Fortress: Macross,Genesis Climber Mospeada, andSuper Dimensional Cavalry Southern Cross. The episodes in this penultimate collection begin theNew Generationstory line, originallyGenesis Climber Mospeada. Drawn by the Protoculture generated during the Second Robotech War, the alien Invid have invaded and conquered Earth. The only opposition to their tyranny comes from the survivors of Admiral Rick Hunter's space fleet and a few rebels on the devastated planet. Lieutenant Scott Bernard manages to assemble a cadre of resistance fighters in record time: sardonic Rand, the obnoxious little girl Annie, cyclone rider Rook, and engineer Lunk. The most curious member of the group is Lancer, who appears as the transvestite performer Yellow Dancer, a singer who models himself after Minmei, the heroine of the first continuity. This unlikely posse is soon battling not only the Invid, but human traitors and gang members. TheElements of Robotechnologydisc includes a stolid presentation of the 1985-86 line of toys from Matchbox--now sought-after collectibles. The unaired pilot forGenesis Climber Mospeadaallows viewers to compare the original story line with the recut version of episode 1, \"The Invid Invasion.\" TheNew Generationstory line is considerably more violent than the previousRobotechcontinuities. Unrated; suitable for ages 10 and up: Violence (human versus human, spaceship and robot battles).--Charles Solomon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000062XDQ", "B00005QZ7O", "B00005PJ7S", "B00005MEUW", "B00005NG69", "B00005BJEF", "B004NJC0JI", "0898654122", "B000NQRV80"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005MEUW", "B000062XDQ", "B00005BJEF", "B00005NG69"]}, "price": 18.68, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 184059}, "asin": "B00005UO7S", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P7NMF5THL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Robotech - The New Generation - Legacy Collection 6"}

A  hazardous-materials-cleanup company has been hired to eliminate asbestos  tiles and other toxic material from a gigantic mental hospital that had  been shut down in the 1980s. But as one member of the team starts to nose  into old files in the office, he uncovers a series of tape recordings of  psychiatric sessions--nine of them--related to a notorious sexual abuse  case. Soon, toxic materials and dark spirits start to merge. LikeThe  Blair Witch Project(and most horror movies, really),Session 9is longer on atmosphere and dream logic than story--but the atmosphere is  effectively unsettling.

{"description": "The seventh and final season ofStar Trek: The Next Generationwill always remain a curiosity in TV sci-fi history. Despite the end being definite, despiteDeep Space Ninetaking over, despite knowing there'd be a movie six months after the series' end, and despiteBabylon 5starting that year with its predetermined story arc, there is nothing here to suggest things were coming to a close. Wesley finally gets dispatched (\"Journey's End\"), but everyone was waiting for that anyway. Some continuity was attempted: there's a sequel to season 1's \"The Battle\" (\"Bloodlines\"), Alexander follows the Klingon soap saga through (\"Firstborn\"), the Maquis and the Cardassians are mentioned several times, and there are final installments for Lwaxana Troi, Barclay, Lore, Guinan, and Ro Laren. None of this brings any form of resolution, however.The one-off story lines seem to throw out ideas that beg for development. \"Force of Nature\" suggests frequent high-warp travel is damaging the very fabric of space/time. \"Parallels\" has Worf experiencing multiple realities, including one in which the Borg won at Wolf 359. \"Lower Decks\" finally introduces some secondary crew from the more than a thousand supposedly supporting Picard and company. There are even hints at some romance at long last between Dr. Crusher and Picard as well as Worf and Troi. In the long run, even after terrific guest spots fromTrekalumni Armin Shimerman and Robin Curtis, and from Paul Sorvino and Kirsten Dunst, there's one thing for which the final year is remembered: \"All Good Things...\" is a near-perfect denouement for the show. With terrific production values and FX, not to mention standout performances from all concerned, it was an amazing surprise to have Q suggest there'd been a story arc right from the get-go. If only this final script had been fully conceived earlier on,The Next Generationmight not have been overshadowed by the glut of TV sci-fi that followed in its wake.--Paul Tonks", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00BHWG0DQ", "B000063V8T", "B000063V8S", "B000063V8R", "B000062XFG", "B00005Y1NF", "B00BHWG0G8", "B00BHWG1AI", "B00005JLF5", "B00062IDCO", "B00062IDLA", "B00008972H", "B000127LW2", "B0002WZTCA", "B000A6CLL0", "B0009I7NGW", "B000AOEMXC", "B0001NBNFW", "B00008KA57", "B00062RCC6", "B000228EBS", "B00008KA5A", "B00062IDDS", "B00008KA58", "B0002JP4GE", "B00008KGT0", "B00008KA59", "B0007TKH66", "B001DHXT6G", "B002I9Z8GM", "B001DHXT3Y", "B000AOEMXM", "B00B7VZN76", "B0095XPZBC", "B00CKYHH6O", "B000HEWEJ4", "B00ENFS0F0", "B0083TUEHY", "6305181721", "B002I9Z8GW", "0671704273", "B00000ILBK", "B0017VG69U", "B0006UEVTA", "B00404ME2E", "B00096S47G", "B00005JLRT", "B00IWTVDUW", "B0000AUHOH", "B002I9Z8I0", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B0019N95IK", "B000BOH8Y6", "B0002XVQNK", "B00AZMFJYA", "B0000UJL96", "B000VDDDY6", "B0002IQKAY", "B008IG0F7G", "B001RHGRTS", "B00CLA3Y2I", "B00CYQXHLC", "B000HWZ4E8", "1451650744", "B00IURL19Y", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B00FFEM0W2", "B000CNE0T2", "B00B5ARKC0", "1451621299", "B002BAW6FE", "B000BT96FA", "B00BAXTY8U", "B00GJT0CXG", "B00198X0YA", "B00008YGRU", "B00F6D62O4", "B006MFQ4DE", "B000A7PKGW", "B000RZIGVS", "B000EXDS34", "B002HQKRBC", "B0024FA9IM", "B002JVWRDG", "B000BOH986", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00JJRLFTU", "B000SAGGL4", "B000BOH990", "B003L77G7Y", "B002I9Z8EO", "B003CN5B7E", "B00022FWEU", "B000BOH98G", "B002GP7ZVO", "B003Y7JWZ0", "B00AGKHC3C", "B009RNK0YC", "B004GZZGVS", "B00H83EUQW"], "bought_together": ["B00BHWG0DQ", "B000063V8T"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000063V8U", "B000063V8T", "B000063V8S", "B000062XFG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 95543}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 74.25, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B000063V8V", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51dvyMs-JsL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek The Next Generation - The Complete Seventh Season"}
{"description": "Retelling a story that has made it onto the silver screen more than most, this latest adaptation of The Count of Monte Cristo makes yet another swashbuckling attempt to win over a new generation of cinema goers. A dashing James Caviezel takes the role of the Count, who is driven by a desire for revenge after being betrayed by his best friend Fernand (played by a dishevelled Guy Pearce) and landed with 16 years of solitary confinement in Chateau D'If, a damp cavernous prison. Thus the scene is set for a good old-fashioned romp. The trouble with this \"re-imagining\" (to borrow a phrase from Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes) is that it's never quite sure whether to take itself seriously or not. Alexandre Dumas's original story is a traditionally melodramatic tale of deceit and double-crossing, with clear-cut bad guys and a moral lesson to be learned at the end. Here, director Kevin Reynolds appears unsure about whether to stick with tradition or bring the story up to date and turn it into a post-modern play on the old Victorian values and style. When the Count and his heavy-breathing loved one are reunited, their kiss is actually framed as a cameo. Both lead actors are also prone to heavy bouts of overacting, garnishing their performances with exaggerated baroque gestures. Clearly this is a film in which the actors could over-indulge themselves and (almost) get away with it, were it not for the fact that--bar Richard Harris as the \"Priest\"--none of them seem to have the faintest idea about how to conduct themselves in a period drama. This Count of Monte Cristo will leave the audience a little confused as to whether they should cry along with the story or laugh along with the actors. --Nikki Disney On the DVD: The Count of Monte Cristo on disc offers no escape from the dry drawl of director Kevin Reynolds, who features in almost every element of the extensive extras package.

{"description": "The new short film \"Scrat's Missing Adventure: Gone Nutty\" showcases the well-timed animation--strongly influenced by Chuck Jones's Road Runner-Wile E. Coyote shorts--that made that frantic little character so effective as a comic foil. It's interesting to compare the Oscar&#xAE;-winning short \"Bunny\" withIce Age. The viewer can see the Blue Sky artists developing the more angular and less detailed look that's become the studio's signature. Like Sid the Sloth, the title character in \"Bunny\" suggests a slightly frayed walk-around figure from a theme park; the texture of her coat anticipates the old-chenille-bathrobe look of Manny the Mammoth's pelt. The clips in different languages, trailers, directors' commentary, and making-of features feel rather standard, but listening to John Leguizamo experiment with different voices before settling on the exaggerated lisp for Sid offers an unusual and funny insight into the development of an animated character.--Charles Solomon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000GUJZ00", "B001GCUNWQ", "B005LAIISA", "B000MV9026", "B004HO6I4M", "B000AY74OG", "B001DPHDCY", "B002WJI2QQ", "B0006JMLRK", "B0012EM5D8", "B0000AOX0O", "B00CWM58WY", "B005QODEEE", "B0039N74CW", "B00005JNQS", "B00003CXJ4", "0783231474", "B001ECQ75A", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B0000640SC", "B001NCDFTW", "B004EPZ034", "B000M343BC", "B000RMJ4F8", "B0042U94UQ", "B00007LVCM", "B00AFEX83C", "B0000VV4W2", "B000UVKGPI", "B00005JMQZ", "B0013FSWT2", "B00G5G7EXY", "B008JFUQ16", "B002ZG97YM", "6305161887", "B0030IIZ4M", "B00005JNS0", "B0013FSL3E", "B005SDUV4E", "B00CHVJODE", "B00EBBGLFC", "B00EV1YZ96", "B001GCUO7A", "B005LAIHW2", "B00E9ZATJO", "B000056H26", "B00029LO0Y", "B000VBJEEG", "B006JD48LO", "B00F522C7C", "B005LAIH4A", "B003H9M1Q2", "B004G600A4", "B00005JM7T", "B005F96UJ6", "B00365F6I2", "B008YWY0HK", "B0030IIYYS", "B00JK531ES", "B00947N6D8", "B001OMU6UM", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B001ILFUD2", "B00000JL8E", "B000L22SG6", "B001GCUNW6", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00009YXAW", "B004LWZW7Y", "B001HN6918", "B003ZHVJGO", "B000065V42", "B00HLTD2OE", "B00275EHJG", "B00E00OGE2", "B00003CXB4", "B001HN6922", "B001U3D88M", "B002ZG9904", "B000H7JCK0", "B000AAF1TU", "B00005JMFH", "B001LPWGFA", "B008NNY9QW", "B009PPO78W", "B000LPS2VI", "B003E66Y84", "B00157OICI", "B003UESJF6", "B00003CXG7", "B001O5LVPI", "B000EQ5UHS", "B00028HBES", "B0000VCZKW", "B000ROAK2W", "B00ALMNCLQ", "B00I6JOD2S", "B000YERP2S", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00H5NY7NG"], "bought_together": ["B004HO6I4M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004HO6I4M", "B005LAIISA", "B00IEXX4KS", "B000MV9026"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 126280}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.07, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B00006CXHU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5150B79E6SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ice Age (2-Disc Special Edition)"}

{"description": "An implausible plot doesn't preventHarrison's Flowersfrom being a  harrowing and moving depiction of the cost of war. Andie MacDowell stars  as Sarah Lloyd, the wife of a photojournalist reported lost in the 1991  civil war raging between ethnic divisions in the former Yugoslavia. Refusing  to believe her husband is dead, Sarah flies to Austria and then drives  into the heart of the war, where she teams up with other photographers  (Adrien Brody and Brendan Gleeson), who help her find a small town where  her husband was last seen--while all around them rages one of the most  horrific conflicts of the late 20th century. The story is barely credible,  but the depiction of the war itself is stunning, and the depiction of the  lives of photojournalists--partly thrill-seeking voyeurs, partly  truth tellers--is complex and compelling. Though MacDowell isn't a great  actress, all the performances are solid, and Brody is outstanding.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000WMFZN8", "B000A2XAPU", "0767825225", "B004YCKJP6", "B006OB3JVQ", "B004R6VHQY", "B00007AJF4", "B000060MUZ", "B000G8P1Y6", "B000GIXEIG", "B006DHATE6", "B00027NVXE", "B000V8VNUM", "B0009PBLU4", "B000WP07F6", "B00003CXSD", "B007WXUVHU", "B001D7WF98", "B00AEFYGBA", "B0059XTUR2", "6305505519", "B000HRMATU", "B003OXGW5M", "B00AEBB8QK", "B001APZMJS", "B002ZG998G", "B00A2H9UG6", "B00006JDVV", "B002SG7Z7A", "B00007L4MO", "B000087F7E", "B00005R87B", "B00CBK6506", "B005FITIDC", "B002P413IC", "B00009XN4C", "B00BTYU3W6", "B0007KIFGE", "B006DHATF0", "B00005AUJR", "B003HDYOTU", "B007UI0CIA", "B0013D8LCC", "B00AAQHP66", "B004C45AX2", "B0055QNLN2", "B004XYOQU4", "B002J1RZHE", "B00A47BT7C", "B00G15MDI0", "B000FVQLRA", "0783222149", "B00008977F", "B001M4YZ90", "B00GM44CBQ", "B0002XNT12", "B0000BWVCR", "B00005RHG5", "B000OHZKHM", "B00008RV0G", "B00003CWSR", "B002WBYDR6", "B000KWZ7JC", "B000E1NXJ0", "B000VMIILU", "B0042KZJIC", "B0009X76ZK", "B002QP145C", "B001H057T6", "B00005TPL2", "B000GBEWO8", "B000059XTK", "B001QTWC0K", "0679763899", "079284646X", "076780676X", "B0064MT1FI", "B007C4ZJ0S", "B0041QSZT2", "B000N6TX1I", "B000EPFCPE", "B00BC0JGUW", "B0067EKYAY", "B0007R4T3U", "B0000DI87S", "B00006FDAU", "B0007TKNII", "B0007IO6NM", "B000CEV3M8", "630523650X", "B0007CILZM", "B0007LMGHC", "B00004XMV9", "B002KAO7EI", "B0015HZA5M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000A2XAPU", "B00AKOMYSM", "0767825225", "B004YCKJP6"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 181985}, "asin": "B00006HAX6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NXCX3HQ6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Harrison's Flowers"}

{"description": "A thriller that's nearly devoid of thrills? That's not a complaint--it's what makesThe American Friendone of the most stylish (and, at the time, most expensive) films to emerge from the New German Cinema of the 1970s. Loosely adapting Patricia Highsmith's mystery novelRipley's Game, director Wim Wenders shifted priority from plotting to character, emphasizing a richly colorful and atmospheric approach to locations in Hamburg, where a picture-framer (Bruno Ganz) is lured into an assassination scheme involving a mysterious Frenchman (Gerard Blain) and the titular American friend, Tom Ripley (played by Dennis Hopper, a far cry from Matt Damon's portrayal of the same character inThe Talented Mr. Ripley). The plotting is vague to the point of irrelevance; Wenders prefers to maintain theauraof mystery, as opposed to generating any conventional suspense, and expresses his affection for American movies by casting favorite directors Nicholas Ray and Samuel Fuller in pivotal supporting roles.

{"description": "The most fertile period of D.W. Griffith's early career is generously preserved in this special edition ofBiograph Shorts. A satisfied actor in early silent films, Griffith was hesitant when the American Biograph company offered him a director's job in 1908, but his first film, \"The Adventures of Dollie\" (reconstructed here from a Library of Congress paper print), gave Griffith the filmmaking fever, and from 1908 to 1913 he averaged two or three shortsper week, of which these 23 represent a comprehensive sampling. Obscurities mingle with masterpieces on two DVDs; highlights include 1909's \"A Corner in Wheat\" (which established Griffith's mastery of social realism); \"The Musketeers of Pig Alley,\" a pioneering gangster film shot on authentic New York locations; and \"The Battle at Elderbush Gulch,\" a dynamic early Western.Although many of these films appear on another compilation (D.W. Griffith: Years of Discovery), important exceptions include 1911's \"Enoch Arden\" (a prestigious adaptation of Tennyson's poem); \"The Usurer,\" one of Griffith's best films from 1910; \"The Last Drop of Water,\" a grand-scale Western made during Griffith's first trip to California (and an indication of grander films to come); and \"His Trust,\" the first of a two-part serial featuring Griffith's then-common use of blackfaced actors as \"noble Negroes.\" Most important (in addition to early appearances by Lillian Gish, Lionel Barrymore, and other silent stars) is the arc of progress that these films represent. In Griffith's capable hands, we witness \"flickers\" in their most rapid stage of development, incorporating new techniques (parallel action and cross-cutting, changing camera angles within a scene, dramatic close-ups) from a tireless innovator who would soon rise to the challenge of epic, feature-length productions.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005YUO9", "B00007CVS8", "B00JRHW4GK", "B00006FMBE", "0679755497", "630507559X", "B00D9BNOKK", "B0006Q93LA", "B001G2S49K", "B00005J75F", "B005QAGBY8", "B00D8HNRBG", "B0013K8J90", "B008D1EEI2", "B0009S4IKG", "B00007CVSA", "B0013XZ6R0", "0073386138", "B000LY271A", "B0054602XK", "B003YBNNMY", "B00D9BNONW", "B0000WN1JA", "B00AB2NWZ2", "B000094J75", "B000AP04MO", "B00AFQSZB0", "B00CL1SQHU", "B005J7K9CI", "B004XEEMA8", "B0082CDGSG", "B000O76Q0C", "B0056ANHCC", "B00AATUZLU", "B003ZYU3T6", "1608191052", "B00CVB6XF2", "B0040QYROA", "B00005QAPH", "B00393SFWU", "B009L147EE", "B008N3E016", "0783232063", "B002NTDX6O", "B004MQ6W5K", "B00AEFXSVE", "B004YOED9M", "B00004Y2QQ", "B000094J79", "B00782O7IY", "B009YX8LO6", "B005QAGC06", "B000NDFI60", "B007PK9MXE", "B001A8HTXC", "B0006GAOO0", "B002BVN3BO", "B00000J11G", "B00005JA9C", "B00004W19G", "0030076064", "B000BDGVR2", "B0006GAONG", "B002SROLUI", "B00008H2GZ", "B000AYEIK4", "B00004Z4TL", "6305470286", "B00009XN8Y", "B001GOEYAG", "B0000AKY5C", "B00005O5CC", "6305211264", "B00005JH9F", "B00478ED6S", "B000XPU4TO", "B003IKNCZY", "B0007M21ZI", "B000BC8T0K", "B000EUM4JQ", "9622093957"], "bought_together": ["B00005YUO9"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00006FMBE", "B00007CVS8", "B00007CVSA", "B00005J75F"]}, "price": 16.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 76085}, "asin": "B00007CVS9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51725AS3R0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Biograph Shorts"}
{"description": "Re-creating the aristocratic splendor and devastating poverty of 18th century France, David Wark Griffith weaves an emotionally charged tale of two delicate souls caught in the tempest of revolution.  Lillian and Dorothy Gish star as the resourceful Henriette and the blind Louise, who leave their countryside home for Paris in hopes of having Louise's sight restored. Spied by the lecherous Marquis de Praille (Morgan Wallace), Henriette is abducted and the women are tragically separated in a city on the brink of anarchy. With the help of a kind-hearted nobleman (Joseph Schildkraut), Henriette endeavors to find the helpless Louise, but cruel fate repeatedly thwarts her efforts. Griffith exploits their heart-wrenching dilemma with masterful skill, crowning the drama with political intrigue, spectacle, and his usual degree of social moralizing (staunchly disclaiming any parallels between the French Revolution and recent waves of \"bolshevism\"), drawing the multi-layered epic to its white-knuckle climax outside the old city gates in Paris, beneath the gleam of the guillotine's scarlet blade. Orphans of the Storm provided Lillian Gish with her final role for Griffith, bringing to a close the long and fruitful collaboration that began in 1912 with An Unseen Enemy (Lillian's and Dorothy's Film Debut).", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00007CVS8", "6305131139", "B00005J75F", "B00K6D1SAC", "B005J7K9EG", "B00D9BNONW", "B00K6D1S7A", "B00D9BNOKK", "B00AEFZDNA", "B003IKNCXQ", "B00EVU3SO0", "B008I3Q0FK", "B000TEUSI6", "B005J7K9CI", "B000E8JO32", "B004KZH5KY", "B00AFQSZB0", "B0000WN1JA", "B000BDH64E", "B000BYA4H4", "6305211264", "B00000JMOO", "B00007CVS9", "B0000633SZ", "B000E6ESX0", "B003GOOYT0", "B0056ANHCC", "B00014NF6G", "B0009S4IKG", "B00DZP1BVO", "B00006FMBE", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B001QFFBAM", "B002XDR5QY", "B00EKGX2P0", "B004OOL73W", "B002TCRQNG", "B00EI3XO9O", "B00066FAOE", "B000YRY7VC", "B00005ABVF", "B0000B1O9L", "B00EO2I6RO", "B00005QW58", "B000G6ORIE", "B000BR6QIM", "B000WMA6FU", "B000HT3QBO", "B000GIXLUW", "B000B83846", "B002TSAAME", "B000VUQ4HW", "B000AP04M4", "B0031KBWQM", "B0040QYROA", "B000066741", "B00CL1SQHU", "6305944415", "B00FEFOK4I", "B004CNK53S", "B0053TWW6S", "B002DDQVP0", "B000094J75", "B00113ALKO", "B000E6ESXK", "B000EU1Q1S", "B00AEFXRWO", "B002945DUW", "B006M3M5FM", "B00GT7YS3I", "B001M9ELJY", "B001BSBBIA", "B000KJU13C", "B000HA4WSO", "B00006JU7S", "B00EOBB636", "B00D3K357O", "B002NEWO8W", "B00FEOYY8G", "B00001YXE2", "B003552QWC", "B00174YBQ2", "B00005NSXY", "B009NUHL8M", "B009L147EE", "B00BTYU3UI", "B00E21D9ME", "B00012FXJ0", "B000EU1Q22", "B000BC8T0K", "B00000JRW5", "B00005O5CE", "B002ANUN4S", "B00006JMQG", "B002GSXKQ0", "B0071CL7SO", "B00005JKGX", "B00480OCVQ", "B002EAYEBK"], "bought_together": ["B00007CVS8", "6305131139"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00007CVS8", "B001G2S48G", "B0012KHTEC", "B00D9BNONW"]}, "price": 17.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 185652}, "asin": "B00007CVSA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SZMBGPCHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Orphans of the Storm (1921)"}

Dalgliesh, a perfect and perhaps unique blend of humble compassion and take-no-prisoners probing mind, becomes the thread in a complex tale of multiple motives, seething emotions, unusual suspects, and such puzzling clues as a burnt diary, all in the effort to find an elusive link between two dead men of very different breeding and destinies.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0008EN6NQ", "B00199PPCE", "B0008EN6O0", "B0008EN6N6", "B0008EN6OA", "B0008EN6MW", "B0008EN6MC", "B0008EN6NG", "B0002HOERQ", "B000AOEMUU", "B000A0GYN2", "B00JJRLFTU", "B00C888LOO", "B00GHH9I62", "B009DS3VQA", "B00C12ZISE", "B00GWXI1F0", "B009DS5OEM", "B0028LOT7O", "B002T9FKZK", "B00GAXASK8", "B00A8KJLPM", "B00GWXI2RM", "B00D49YBTA", "B005X5XINI", "B00GWXI20E", "B00DUX28XQ", "1400096472", "B000XBPDY4", "B000CRR36K", "B0056031NW", "B009DS6YGO", "B00GWXI16O", "B005TTEG5W", "B00A27O5AW", "B003O97W2I", "B000GW8U4A", "B00CEBJCF2", "B007T40GOK", "B00IBKXP8A", "B00HGE90Z4", "B002F80SWA", "B002MUAXJ4", "B002WN8IS4", "B00EH4KY2Y", "B00GAH87RK", "B002T9DJNA", "B007T40GRW", "B002XTBEE2", "B00CLF81Z8", "B0050MB3RM", "B009D4RW96", "B00860YI40", "B00D7AM2WO", "B00A0HT99G", "B000068UE9", "B0053O8AGY", "B007S0DEB2", "B005HWAOH0", "B001V7YZD4", "B00132D84E", "B00EV1YZD2", "B002DY9KRK", "B006MK4QKW", "B0089TQ7AG", "B001B43IUS", "B00BEZEDNU", "B005SH65S6", "B0028AENSK", "B00BQXTCVS", "B005SH65SG", "B00ANGICCO", "B002VWWLDY", "B009DS31ZG", "B008RO6PJQ", "B003TY2ST0", "B00BDSRM4K", "B002MUAXIA", "B00EH4L3X8", "B0051XIPYO", "B001JXPC3M", "B00016MSSU", "B00FPPQYXM", "B006MK6Y8Y", "B001AXL67W", "B004SI5VUY", "B00H4ZEFTQ", "B00BVMX4ZY", "B001PU8N0S", "B00065GX96", "B001G1FL4W", "B003YCI238", "B0001WTUK8", "B005DVIPY4", "B009Z59ZNE", "B009D4SFEC", "B00F1BFRA6", "B000BITVAG", "B00009QGAU", "B0002XVRXY"], "bought_together": ["B0008EN6O0", "B00199PPCE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000AOEMUU", "B0008EN6MC", "B0008EN6MW", "B0008EN6OA"]}, "price": 42.33, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 352168}, "asin": "B00008973N", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AW413H14L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "P.D.

{"description": "Kate Hudson twinkles as the heroine of How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days. She's a magazine writer assigned to date a guy, make all the mistakes girls make that drive guys away (being clingy, talking in baby-talk and so on) and records the process like a sociological experiment. However, the guy she picks-- Matthew McConaughey--is an advertising executive who's just bet that he can make a woman fall in love with him in 10 days; if he succeeds, he'll win a huge account that will make his career. The set-up is completely absurd, but the collision of their efforts to woo and repel creates some pretty funny scenes. McConaughey's easy charm and Hudson's lightweight impishness play well together and the plot, though strictly Hollywood formula, chugs along efficiently. At moments Hudson seems to channel her mother, Goldie Hawn, to slightly unnerving effect. --Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00007E2F5", "B00003CXSM", "B00AEFXWXI", "B0012KJ0DK", "B002K0WBXW", "B0015I2RT8", "B00164KYV4", "B004EPZ070", "B0000897EG", "B00447L4KA", "B002P413IC", "B00005JN3W", "B002ZG988M", "B000MQC9H4", "B002ZG989G", "B00AEBB8NS", "B000A343RI", "B001TUZD8O", "B00006ZXSL", "B00005O5CM", "B001OQCUZM", "B004EPZ0BG", "B00081U7HC", "B004SIP9X8", "B003Y5H574", "B001Y8DJVE", "6304765266", "B00008NRI7", "B000YDBPAM", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00AEBB8R4", "B00AEFYQE2", "B000683VI4", "B0000524E5", "B00AEBB9WI", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B00AEFYM2S", "B000YAA68C", "B00AMEZDJW", "B0007PLLBU", "B00006ZXSK", "B002ZG984Q", "B0009OL7Z4", "B002ZG9968", "B0036TGSIK", "B000023VTP", "B003BV8ICC", "B00AEFYWQY", "B00AEBB8YW", "B000J4QW7W", "B003B3V0N4", "B00005JG6N", "B0000DIXDR", "B004SEUJK0", "B005LAIGSM", "B000ELJAEM", "B0001Z3TXE", "B000957O82", "B001OQCUYI", "B004SIP9RO", "B004SIP8LG", "B003NHRIVQ", "B0013D8LHC", "B00AKGG6JS", "B00008WJD6", "B003Y5H524", "B000J103OI", "B0050MB584", "B00006ZXSO", "B00006FMUW", "B000HEWEE4", "6305236569", "B000XJD33O", "B002ZG99UE", "B0035Q637K", "B00466HN7M", "B001L9EXTS", "B00386EZKE", "B001C5LLQ4", "076780421X", "B000J3OTSM", "B000E6EHE0", "B004LWZW9C", "B00005JM55", "B000EMGICS", "B000CEV3KU", "B008JFUUIA", "B00003CXMP", "B000P0J0DS", "B000TZJBPQ", "B0000AOV4I", "B005Z9MFRC", "B0000D8L1K", "B000HCPS94", "B00E8RKHWW", "B00AEFY4CG", "B004SIP8JI", "B0001AVZA8", "B005LAIGXW", "B000Y7U93C"], "bought_together": ["B00007E2F5", "B002K0WBXW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002K0WBXW", "B002ZG989G", "B00007E2F5", "B00447L4KA"]}, "price": 14.16, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 346003}, "asin": "B00008KDGZ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512083xZEbL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"}

Another commentary track, in which the authors recall the making of the film and the material that was cut, lasts 17 minutes and is not related to the portion of the film it accompanies.  A pop-up \"fact track\" offers further background and production info, as does a 15-minute making-of featurette.

Now the lone descendant of this grisly tribe has surfaced, prowling the streets of London for fresh victims and a new mate.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00LBFFR2Y", "B00ARWX9NG", "B000FSME2E", "B00009PY2T", "B00HRUQ7WG", "B00D7AM71A", "B0000694WG", "B005GPFZEK", "B00E3H3CO2", "B000EOTTY0", "B00009WNXA", "B00026PA70", "B002XDR5LE", "B0081XOKH2", "B000GIXCL0", "B0002Y69V8", "B00JPUUQVE", "B0053TWW9K", "B00I9N56WW", "B00JJOY496", "B00BCMSY80", "B00HRUQB8Q", "B000IMUYJM", "B00JJOY41E", "B0053TWW36", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B00ITZXDDY", "B00JJOY47I", "B001J710Y8", "B000KN9F6W", "B001M0NJ0K", "B00HT2RTU6", "B009IV2Z3M", "B000092T69", "B004UOHNAC", "B00DOZNGTK", "B00B49GSO8", "B000068TPD", "B001PYD0PC", "B003L1YESE", "B00E5S2HGS", "B00A429Y9M", "B003KGBISE", "1606730266", "B00023P4UQ", "B0016K76VE", "B00H0EN98Y", "B00GHH9IIA", "B000A59Q2I", "B00D7AM5XU", "B00JQYV0B4", "B000A0GOF0", "B000S0GYRU", "B00125WATQ", "B00005K3O7", "B002WJHBE0", "B0053TWVQE", "B000UDGO9S", "B00BCMT2BI", "B000TZJCMS", "B001B8XRT6", "B004VQRCHS", "B00GHH9GSC", "B008WAM2E2", "B0096RC5XI", "B00G5GNYY2", "B00GOT1DIE", "B0012IV3SC", "B003JIPN20", "B000UGBOTA", "B000G6BLYM", "B000092Q5E", "B008H1Q3JG", "B00A429Y56", "B001QMCJ4Q", "B00AJXO4FA", "B000V6LT6C", "B00127RAJ4", "B00027JYMG", "B000A2XA78", "B00D9EJFV4", "0792839684", "B000GIXCLK", "B00GBT62PQ", "B00C7A8WZQ", "B00DBNLAZW", "B0024FAG44", "B001LIK8DO", "B00D97DMBU", "B002LBGB7W", "B000N2HDP0", "B000MV8ZCW", "B001AR0D6I", "B00009PY45", "B003WKL6X0", "B000RO9PUU", "B00005JH9M", "B003V924Y2", "B00009YXHG"], "bought_together": ["B000FSME2E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00009WNXA", "B004QF71ZM", "B0002CHK1S", "B004ODLUFS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 135669}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.4, "brand": "Raw", "asin": "B00009PY41", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WJTP9RE1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Raw Meat"}

Then the  fun begins. With just a week left to go on episode #2 ofTime  Journeys, only five of the 312 cuts (scenes) in the program have been completed!  Kuromi spends the week on fast forward, nagging animators, chasing down artwork,  juggling schedules, etc. Director/storyboard artist Akitaroh Diachi punches up  the humor by including bits of the show in various stages of completion. This  brief (40 minutes) OVA offers a very funny spoof of how studio animation is  done, both in Japan and the United States. The more the viewer knows about the  process, the more they'll appreciate the jokes.

Murnau crafted works of great subtlety and emotional complexity through his absolute command of of the cinematic medium. Known for such dazzling films as Nosferatu (1922), The Last Laugh (1924), Faust (1926) and Sunrise (1927), Murnau was also drawn to more intimate dramas exploring the dark corners of the human mind.   In Tartuffe, he revisits Moliere's fable of religious hypocrisy, in which a faithful wife (Lil Dagover) tries to convince her husband (Werner Krauss) that their morally superior guest, Tartuffe (Emil Jannings), is in fact a lecherous hypocrite with a taste for the grape. To endow the story with contemporary relevance, Murnau frames Moliere's tale with a modern-day plot concerning a housekeeper's stealthy efforts to poison her elderly master and take control of his estate.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006JMQH", "B00005QW58", "B00006JMQI", "B0000B1A1J", "B000HC2LOY", "B00064AEWY", "B00113ALKO", "B00004Z4VE", "B0001Y4MJA", "B00005QW59", "B001M9ELJY", "B000W9TTSS", "B0007TKNHY", "B000FS9FLC", "B00064AEXI", "B00007CVS8", "B00008DDRQ", "B000A7DVR2", "B001CD6HQA", "B00005O5CF", "B00005JA9C", "B0024OW20Q", "B0063E00HU", "B000067IY7"], "bought_together": ["B000HC2LOY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00008DDRQ", "B000YPUFBA"]}, "price": 17.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 161301}, "asin": "B0000DZTOV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5180V4XDJXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tartuffe/The Way to Murnau"}

{"description": "A movie doesn't win seven Oscars for nothing. A glowing Greer Garson (Best Actress) commands the screen as Mrs. Miniver, a middle-class British housewife whose strength holds her family together as World War II literally hits their home. Walter Pidgeon as her architect husband seems to be the prototype for future TV dads in this affecting portrait of love--familial and romantic--during war. But the relationship between Mrs. Miniver's college-age son (Richard Ney) and the upper-crust Carol (Best Supporting Actress Teresa Wright) is filled with inherent drama--as the war speeds up their young love, it also has the potential to doom it. The 1942 film, which also won for Best Picture and Best Director, is filled with colorful characters, snappy dialogue, and sensational plot twists. Although you spend much of the movie dreading that one of the Minivers will become a casualty of war, when it finally happens, it's not what you anticipated. Exactly what you'd expect from a legendary film that lives up to its billing.--Valerie J.

{"description": "While it doesn't hold together as a three-hour TV drama,Dreamkeepershould prove enthralling to anyone interested in Native American myths and legends. A variety of tribal folklore provides the episodic thrust of this typical Hallmark production, which relies too heavily on digital effects--and the plodding direction of Hallmark regular Steve Barron--in telling the story of a resentful Lakota teenager (Eddie Spears) who reluctantly agrees to drive his wise old grandfather (August Schellenberg) from their South Dakota \"rez\" to an All-Nations Powwow in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Along the way, the tradition-bound elder serves as tribal \"dreamkeeper\" for his initially resistant grandson, who gradually realizes that his grandfather's stories--visualized through effects-laden reenactments involving all manner of magic and mystery--are essential in preserving the fading cultures of the Lakota and the several other tribes whose folklore depends on unbroken generations of oral tradition. While some of the lavishly dramatized tales can stand alone as authentic Native American myth-making,Dreamkeeperlacks the overall structure that could've given the stories a cumulative magical impact.

{"description": "Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce star in this 1939 adaptation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's frequently filmed novel, and the result is one of the most atmospheric and purely enjoyable versions ofThe Hound of the Baskervilles. Except for minor changes, the script is true to Doyle's enthralling mystery about a centuries-long curse against heirs to the Baskerville estate, situated within the haunting and deadly Dartmoor in the southwest of England. With the arrival of a new master, Canadian Henry Baskerville (Richard Greene), Sherlock Holmes (Rathbone) and Dr. Watson (Bruce) are called upon to solve the strange case of the \"gigantic hound\" that may be readying to savage the poor fellow. Wonderful sets, crisp performances, and Rathbone's accessible but no-nonsense take on the Great Detective make this a real delight. Typical of the 20th Century Fox Holmes pictures, there's an in-joke, a final line of censor-defying dialogue alluding to Holmes's little problem with cocaine.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001DCYB4", "B000062XEY", "B0000APVC7", "B0000EMYKY", "B0000APVBY", "B00007H5C8", "B0000APVBL", "B0000APVBR", "B0000AOV8O", "B0000APVC3", "B0000EMYKN", "B0044LYRGO", "B0000EMYKH", "B0000797E7", "B002OQZE6I", "B002EOVXAG", "B0000APVBO", "B002OQZE6S", "B0000APVC5", "B0000APVCA", "B0000APVBM", "B0000EMYKJ", "B0000EMYI1", "B002Q3MYA8", "B003UAKECG", "B002IJA66E", "B000GRUQK6", "B001TE6P78", "B0045HCJS0", "0982954328", "0783240961", "B0045HCJSA", "B000A9QK8M", "B00049QQJQ", "B003NF97NA", "B000035Z3K", "B00001TZ6Q", "B000GY728I", "B00DZP1C9K", "B000MGBLHS", "B000EXZFRQ", "B00009NHC0", "B000K7VHMI", "B000060MVK", "B004ZEDJLY", "B00CTWSGA8", "B005ETANC2", "B00AEFYO5I", "0788602047", "B005DI9906", "B00005JMR7", "B000FKO3U8", "B000083C6R", "B00AATUZQA", "078323502X", "B00000JMOF", "B000063UR0", "B003ZEQMH8", "B000YDMPCO", "6305081832", "B000BBOUGI", "B001BSBBGC", "B000VUQ4HW", "B005ETAN7C", "B002EOVXAQ", "B00A1AU5Z4", "B000RPCJB6", "B001KP2J3U", "B0010YSD7W", "B00005NSXY", "B000MGBLI2", "B0006B2A7E", "B007XTDXF0", "B0000AUHPC", "B00871C09S", "B001ARDBXK", "078324097X", "B00006G8K0", "079283366X", "B0048NRQH0", "B00361EWJK", "B00005JKU0", "0783233582", "B00000CQJZ", "B0006HBV32", "B000EXDSAW", "B00008LDNZ", "B0007OY2OY", "B00383XZP8", "B009YX8MSG", "1402770006", "B000QGDJG0", "B0002HS738", "148410031X", "B00005JKGX", "B0000549B0", "B00000F17A", "B001GLX6UI", "B00009NHBC", "B00000ILEU"], "bought_together": ["B0001DCYB4", "B0000EMYKY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002EOVXAQ", "B002EOVXAG", "B002OQZE6S", "B000062XEY"]}, "price": 12.97, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 21158}, "asin": "B0001DCYBE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SS3JJN1GL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sherlock Holmes - The Hound of the Baskervilles"}

{"description": "The lavish 1948 production ofJoan of Arcmay not qualify as a great movie, but it scores a triumphant victory as a great DVD. Thanks to a stunning restoration by the renowned UCLA Film and Television Archive, this relic from Hollywood's golden age can now be appreciated in all its magnificent Technicolor glory, restored to its original theatrical length of 145 minutes after decades of truncated TV broadcasts. Under the direction of Victor Fleming (whose credits includeGone with the WindandThe Wizard of Oz), this is a stodgily respectable mini-epic, adapted from Maxwell Anderson's acclaimed playJoan of Lorraineand giving 33-year-old Ingrid Bergman one of her quirkiest star turns as the 19-year-old \"Maid of Lorraine,\" destined by divinely inspired fate to rescue imperiled France from British occupation, and face trial on charges of witchcraft. Winner of three Oscars (for cinematography and costumes, and an honorary award to Producer Walter Wanger for boosting Hollywood's \"moral stature\") and five nominations (including acting nods for Bergman and Jos&#xE9; Ferrer, making his screen debut as the French Dauphin), the film suffers from an abundance of talky exposition and stage-bound incident, but the battle scenes are still rousing, Bergman glowing beatifically in polished armor and surrounded by a seasoned cast of studio-era character players in a rampant case of Hollywood anachronism (somehow, Ward Bond just doesn't belong in medieval France!). If you get bored during the slow parts, you can always marvel at the pristine restoration, full of heavenly sunbeams, masterful matte paintings, and enough colorful detail to make most 1948-vintage films pale by comparison.

{"description": "As the triumphant start of a trilogy,The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ringleaves you begging for more. By necessity, Peter Jackson's ambitious epic compresses J.R.R. Tolkien's classicThe Lord of the Rings, but this robust adaptation maintains reverent allegiance to Tolkien's creation, instantly qualifying as one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. At 178 minutes, it's long enough to establish the myriad inhabitants of Middle-earth, the legendary Rings of Power, and the fellowship of hobbits, elves, dwarves, and humans--led by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the brave hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood)--who must battle terrifying forces of evil on their perilous journey to destroy the One Ring in the land of Mordor. Superbly paced, the film is both epic and intimate, offering astonishing special effects and production design while emphasizing the emotional intensity of Frodo's adventure, and ends on a perfect note of heroic loyalty and rich anticipation.After the breaking of the Fellowship, Frodo and Sam journey to Mordor with the creature Gollum as their guide inThe Two Towers. Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) join in the defense of the people of Rohan, who are the first target in the eradication of the race of Men by the renegade wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee) and the dark lord Sauron. Fantastic creatures, astounding visual effects, and a climactic battle at the fortress of Helm's Deep makeThe Two Towersa worthy successor toThe Fellowship of the Ring, grander in scale but retaining the story's emotional intimacy.WithThe Return of the King, the greatest fantasy epic in film history draws to a grand and glorious conclusion. The trilogy could never fully satisfy those who remain exclusively loyal to Tolkien's expansive literature, but as a showcase for physical and technical craftsmanship it is unsurpassed in pure scale and ambition, setting milestone after cinematic milestone as Frodo and Sam continue their mission to Mordor to destroy the soul-corrupting One Ring. While the heir to the kingdom of Men, Aragorn, endures the massive battle at Minas Tirith with the allegiance of Legolas, Gimli, and Gandalf, Frodo and Sam must survive the schizoid deceptions of Gollum, who remains utterly convincing as a hybrid of performance (by Andy Serkis) and subtly nuanced computer animation. Jackson and cowriters Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens have much ground to cover; that they do so with intense pacing and epic sweep is impressive enough, but by investing greater depth and consequence in the actions of fellow hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), they ensure thatThe Return of the Kingmaintains the trilogy's emphasis on intimate fellowship and remains faithful to Tolkien's overall vision. By ending theLOTRtrilogy with noble integrity and faith in the power of imaginative storytelling,The Return of the King, like its predecessors, will stand as an adventure for the ages.--Jeff Shannon and David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B005OCFGTO", "B001DJLD1M", "B001BYMX4A", "B009JBWOU0", "B00003CXCT", "B00005JPH2", "B001BRJZPW", "B000QXDED6", "B000E8M0VA", "B000VWYJ86", "B000HEVZ9E", "B005COPWZW", "B00005JKZY", "0345538374", "B001F12J0C", "B0057RCFQS", "B00003CWT6", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00003CXC5", "B000I0RQVI", "B0060FXDCG", "B0054OGQM8", "B004M1A21K", "B001DHXT20", "B008MIMWP8", "B008JFUO72", "B001VLFE7G", "B00G1BPIOU", "B002HWRYJE", "B000YGDNPO", "B000VBIGCW", "B00E9PMML2", "B004H83IM8", "B004EPZ08O", "B0015XHP4A", "B001E75QH0", "B0090SI56Y", "B000P0J0AQ", "B001VLBDD0", "B008JFUS0U", "B00IV2I7IQ", "B003PIUINS", "B000UR9T8C", "B000U7WV1Y", "B006VRRGNK", "B007D5E7C2", "0345518845", "B0049IHX2C", "B00AZMFJYA", "B0015I2RT8", "B004LWZWGA", "B002I9Z8I0", "B0001HLVS2", "B002VPE1AW", "B004LWZW42", "B00003CXZ4", "B00E5I2MCM", "B004EPYZU8", "B008JFURII", "B00003CXC3", "B005LAIH54", "6305313687", "B0084IG8TM", "B00000K3D4", "B001CK1D44", "B00AEFXDO6", "B002ZG999U", "B00E9PMMX0", "B0042U94UQ", "B00275EGWY", "B001KVZ6FW", "B003Q6D2B4", "B000J4P9P8", "B0001Z4OXS", "B00177YA1K", "B003UYUQZW", "B0019L770A", "B000E6ESEY", "B003AWRMCE", "B000HCO83Q", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B0083SBMBM", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00011CZRE", "079284646X", "B00008G8M5", "B002ZG97YM", "B002ZG980U", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000U1ZV8K", "B008UZA8FY", "B005LAIIMG", "B004EPZ084", "B003EYVXTG", "B00005JKZV", "B00447L4JG"], "bought_together": ["B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HWWUQWQ", "B00005JKZY", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00003CWT6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 72846}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 39.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001VL0K2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51z4rwl-jOL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "What's scarier than scary kids?Village of the Damnedis the definitive scary-kid classic, a truly unsettling film drawn from John Wyndham's novelThe Midwich Cuckoos. The brilliant opening sequence depicts the sudden and temporary paralysis of a small English hamlet, which is followed by the town's women becoming mysteriously pregnant. The spawn of this occurrence are a dozen eerie, blond-headed children, who are either gifted, evil, or \"the world's new people.\" A splendid outing, not least in the way it catches parental anxiety about this small new stranger in one's home. (It was remade by John Carpenter in 1995.)Children of the Damnedfollows up with a story about six more creepy kids, brought from all over the globe to huddle in a old church in London. An excellent opening half-hour gets bogged down in the movie's global-political ambitions (it's very much a cold war offering), but it has its share of shivery moments--the sight of the six youngsters striding down a London street as though they controlled the world is a chiller. But where's the blond hair? The two films are different in tone;Villagefeels like a fifties sci-fi offering, with an old-school star (George Sanders) and classical style;Childrenis a film of the sixties, with hipper techniques, urban setting, and young actors Ian Hendry and Alan Badel. But both have those damned kids.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783230427", "B000A0GOF0", "B00027JYNK", "B0009X75EC", "B000063UR0", "B007Y1NNAW", "B00LU4URS0", "B0000694WH", "B00005R1O7", "B000AYELJ2", "B00009NHC0", "B0007R4T26", "B005HIBWBG", "B002945DUW", "B000RXVNDI", "B00AEBB8VK", "B00518A70E", "B000UDGOBG", "6305869367", "B0045HCJJE", "B00D9EJFV4", "B00LC4PEZ4", "B00D9EJFZA", "B000G6BLYM", "B001B9ZVVC", "B00005JKFR", "B00000K3U3", "B00005LIRD", "0783116926", "B000EHSVJG", "B00005NSXY", "B000UAFDR0", "B00K6D1S7A", "B000FOPPEC", "B000A0GOEQ", "B000A0GOFA", "B00DZP1C9K", "B000OHZJGO", "B005ETANC2", "B000068TPG", "0991127900", "B000AQKU72", "6305761078", "B0045HCJSA", "B0048O2YWG", "B00DOZNGC2", "B0034PWPHY", "B000C20VNM", "B00KSPST6Y", "B00023P4TM", "B000HT38B2", "B0009X770E", "B00009PY4D", "B000FFJZO2", "B00KIZY0EE", "B00K2CHVSK", "B0000694WM", "B0009X770O", "B000S0GYBG", "B000FVQLKW", "B0013XZ6SY", "B00AEBB94G", "B00009NHBC", "B004X63SCY", "B00KIZYDCI", "B00B94VJYW", "B000062XEY", "B0053TWVDC", "B001BSBBNK", "6305944288", "B00009PY2T", "B001BSBBGC", "B005D0RDKM", "B000BYA5IC", "B00003CXCF", "B000RXVNCO", "B000OHBCI8", "B00009PY4A", "B00009PY38", "B00006SFIT", "B00023P4UQ", "B00027JYLC", "B002TSAAS8", "B00DSAUJ32", "B00465I1BK", "B00005Y6XR", "B00005R1O8", "B00IYJFB2G", "B0045HCJKS", "B0002IQL8K", "B005GPFZEK", "B000TLTCT0", "B000EHSVJ6", "B000HEWEDK", "B00ITZXDDY", "B0000A9GHP", "6305772681", "B00006CXGP", "6305772142", "B0009PLLMC"], "bought_together": ["0783230427"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0783230427", "B00027JYNK", "B0009X75EC", "B000063UR0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 29525}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.05, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00027JYMG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SknyPjhrL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Village of the Damned/Children of the Damned"}

{"description": "In the annals of acting, 2004 will be remembered as a banner year for Jamie Foxx. Before his acclaimed turns inCollateral, alongside Tom Cruise, andRay, the Ray Charles biopic, he produced and starred in this made-for-cable movie about former gangbanger Stan \"Tookie\" Williams. Directed by actor-turned-filmmaker Vondie Curtis Hall (Gridlock'd),Redemptiontracks Tookie's rise as co-founder of L.A.&#x92;s notorious Crips, fall to death-row inmate, and rise again to Nobel Prize Nominee.

{"description": "Before James Cameron's 1997 blockbuster Titanic, the Hollywood Titanic of 1953, the 1958 British film A Night to Remember, and the 1997 Broadway musical Titanic, there was the Nazi German film Titanic. A Tonis production begun in 1942, this production nearly sank as decisively as the doomed ocean liner. The film's director, Herbert Selphin, infuriated with the slow second-unit shooting in the port of Gdynia, was overheard making remarks damning the German army. Reported to the Gestapo, Selphin was arrested and later found hanging in his prison cell, the victim of an arranged \"suicide.\" In April, 1943, the film was banned by the Berlin censors for German release because of its terrifying scenes of panic, all to familiar to German civilizations undergoing nightly Allied bombing raids. After extensive cutting, Titanic was released in occupied Paris and a few army installations. The film was seen in Germany finally in late 1949, but banned a few months later in the Western sectors (though not in the Soviet zone, because of its unmistakable anti-British-capitalist theme). Technically, this Titanic is an excellent catastrophic film; its shots of the ship sinking were later used by the 1958 British film without credit. Somewhat true to the facts - though peppered with fictional good Germans both on and below deck, in steerage - the film ends with a trial scene that acquits the White Star Line management, followed by a final slide denouncing England's \"eternal quest for profit.\" These packed a powerful propaganda punch ; cut from the post-war prints, they have been restored for this Kino on Video version.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B006ML50SS", "B000JLIYRQ", "B00008LDO9", "B0017ZGYR0", "B00079HZSE", "B0074JODXU", "B009DA73US", "B003VWVRU6", "B00CXZQZF4", "B009DA73XA", "B006ENHG8Q", "B005X7H9SQ", "B007G8MN1S", "B0002CHI2Y", "B006HAJB02", "B004EI2NWM", "B006ML50TC", "B0071LEIPE", "B00FM4S7FE", "0752458965", "B003JQZXWW", "B00114OFLO", "B006ZGRO16", "B000LM9QR0", "B00ICWO1LC", "B007T40GNQ", "B004TXFFI6", "B006QVRW2G", "B009AVCAE4", "B000HD1MW0", "B003ZFXE82", "B007R7V3MS", "B006US3UKS", "B0040QYROA", "B00CVB6UXW", "B004U7EIES", "B00005J75F", "B00000INUB", "B007F4UHMA", "B00006JMQG", "B000SAIXU6", "B009KCS97A", "B005MXQD4W", "B000X5SFSG", "B004SJVQ4I", "B003B3NV5E", "B0001DMQ6C", "B00005QW59", "B0000633SI", "B00A196N8I", "B00CPR3RB0", "B000093NQZ", "B00J2F6CEW", "B003EYEEI8", "B000777JH8", "B00009NHBC", "B00D9BNONW", "B0014CKCEC", "B004H9ZQ4K", "B00000ILEU", "B00HE00ZIQ", "B008EXG6QC", "B00DOZNGC2", "B000EXDSBQ", "0783229372", "0674724747", "B00BWH6DK6", "B0009X770E", "B000H1RFSM", "B008G584HC", "B0040QYROK", "B00D9EJFV4", "B0070285YE", "B005F265FW", "B009W3VDEI", "B000N3T0GO", "B00D3XMNAG", "B0002S65WM", "B000C65YS0", "B003XZF2KC", "B00009MEJA", "B00GPPXNEE", "B00000CQJZ", "B0063E00GQ", "B00BGGIUVI", "B001SMC9L2", "B00CBJ53HS", "B0014Z4OMK", "B001QIP5AA", "B005HQBO9I", "B005HQBO9S", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B006X0ZN26", "B002LFPBJW", "B0068Y4NBY", "B000TXNDT8", "0307377296", "B00022Z06K", "B001HPOJ68"], "bought_together": ["B006ML50SS", "B00008LDO9"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00008LDO9", "B006ML50SS", "B00079HZSE", "B0074JODXU"]}, "price": 17.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 132858}, "asin": "B0002CHI3S", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FDFX9B84L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Titanic"}

{"description": "Long before Ashton met Demi or Topher got lost inTraffic, the makers ofThird Rock from the Sunstepped into the Wayback Machine and emerged withThat '70s Show. It would go on to become the Fox Network's most successful sitcom sinceMarried... with Children. Set in the Wisconsin suburbs of 1976, the action centers around 17-year-old Eric Forman (Topher Grace), his friends, and his family. He's an ordinary teenager, much like the slackers of Richard Linklater'sDazed and Confused, with an interest in girls, cars, beer, and rock & roll (but not necessarily in that order).Eric's friends include hipster Hyde (Danny Masterson), exchange student Fez (Wilmer Valderrama), and dim-bulb Kelso (Ashton Kutcher). Donna (Lora Prepon), Eric's neighbor, is also a friend, but she'll soon become something more, while Kelso already has a girlfriend, the bossy Jackie (Mila Kunis)--and a crush on Eric's sister Laurie (Lisa Robin Kelly). Kelso and Jackie will spend a good part of the first year breaking up just to make up, while Hyde pines for Donna and Fez for Jackie. Eric's family also includes father Red (Kurtwood Smith) and mother Kitty (Debra Jo Rupp). Donna's includes mother Midge (former Bond girl Tanya Roberts) and perm-sporting father Bob (Don Stark).The first season boasts a period-perfect bevy of guest stars, including Danny Bonaduce (\"Eric's Burger Job\"), Eve Plumb (\"The Keg\"), and Marion Ross as Eric&#x92;s grandmother (\"Sunday, Bloody Sunday\" and other episodes). That said, ifThat '70s Showwere just a nostalgia trip, it wouldn't have lasted for over seven seasons. Alas, lightning wouldn&#x92;t strike twice. When the same producers followed-up withThat '80s Showa few years later, it would soon disappear without a trace.

{"description": "One of the first gems of the cable TV age,Faerie Tale Theatrebrings 26 classic tales to life. Produced over a five-year span (1982-87) for Showtime,FTTbrought together creative dramatics and whimsical writing with some of the top talents of the day. Executive producer/host Shelley Duvall (who was coming off her breakout role inThe Shining) shepherds this mix of theatrical simplicity and grand storytelling for these oft-told tales (\"Goldilocks and the Three Bears,\" \"Little Red Riding Hood,\" \"Hansel and Gretel,\" \"Sleeping Beauty,\" and the like) for kids and their parents. Since they are not elaborately produced,FTTmay be a hard sell for some smaller members of the family at first, but most should be hooked, even older kids who may pooh-pooh fairy tales. There's always a slight twist that makes these productions fresh.The cast is amazing, especially when you think how lightly cable television was thought of in the '80s: Jeff Bridges, Bud Cort, Liza Minnelli, James Coburn, Susan Sarandon, Christopher Reeve, Klaus Kinski, Billy Crystal, Matthew Broderick, Gregory Hines, Eric Idle, Robin Williams, and Mick Jagger are some of the talented--and varied--actors appearing. Crystal's take on the smart \"Little Pig\" (with Jeff Goldblum as the wolf) and Williams's \"Frog Prince\" are two comic gems. Malcolm McDowell, right in the middle of his career high-point of playing baddies, brings flair to the Big Bad Wolf, while his then-real-life wife Mary Steenburgen beautifully counterpoints as Red Riding Hood. The casting of Vincent Price and Vanessa Redgrave in \"Snow White\" is inspired. Also impressive are the directors Duvall pooled: Tim Burton (\"Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp\"), Francis Ford Coppola (\"Rip Van Winkle\") Peter Medak (three episodes), Nicholas Meyer (\"Pied Piper\"), and Roger Vadim (\"Beauty and the Beast\"). You can go on for days about these wonderful tales, most totaling around the 45-minute mark, but it's better just to get the set and start wherever you'd like; you will get to the end sooner than you think.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002CLKOYM", "B000EU1Q5E", "B001O5LVQ2", "B0009UVCRG", "B0009UVCRQ", "B000FSME7O", "B001JI4UMQ", "B0009U7LO4", "B00402FGM6", "B008N8A3JE", "B0001BKBD4", "B00005RDST", "B00KS9V6EC", "B00CMDPTTA", "B0009U7LOO", "B004DTLKC6", "B0009U7LNU", "B00EQ2KVQQ", "B0009U7LNK", "B00265T7MO", "B0000DZ3EN", "B001JQHT26", "B00B04NIZO", "B001B73Q20", "B00JHH1ZN8", "B00061UHYM", "B00061UI0A", "B00000K3D4", "B000EQ5PPA", "B006HSYIVG", "B001QU880W", "B00IF0KASY", "B00FRQ0L2O", "B00068NVG6", "B004B93RDS", "B0062KMDWU", "B000A345C6", "B0000639G3", "B003A6X166", "B001PK47GW", "B0041SI78O", "076781326X", "B00CYQXFP0", "B006WNSHUY", "B00000JPH6", "B00BCMT4B6", "B00CKYHH82", "B00006RCNV", "B0001I55UQ", "B00HZMZ2HM", "B0016BPWNM", "B000S0KYTE", "B002GOAH10", "B00K5ZXKFM", "B0013ND30M", "B000NJMJGG", "B00007L4I6", "B008JFUNYG", "B002945DUW", "B00CKJJ1IG", "B002CAWNHE", "B00IYMSMTM", "B00004TJJV", "B00AO686MY", "B002HK9IDQ", "B00001PE59", "B0001I562I", "B00IF0KAYS", "B00JPS6A3O", "B00E5G03I4", "B00JF5GAZA", "B00080ZFZC", "B002DH20Q0", "B001AGXEAG", "B00004Z4SE", "B003L77GWE", "B00CYQXE10", "B009INAK8C", "6305236569", "B003VS0CX8", "B000XT1P5C", "B0009X75QU", "B000TGJ8B2", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B0009ULBGS", "B00A7OIXW6", "B00AEBB8VK", "B009INAC12", "B000055ZOB", "B002NZK5V4", "B002CLBJPK", "6305161887", "B002Z7FM68", "B00HGE90Z4", "B0000AOX0O", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00BG92NPO", "B00E9ZATKI", "B008F5IE1Y", "B00CTNYLS8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002CLKOYM", "B000FSME7O", "B00CMDPTTA", "B00061UHZG"]}, "price": 32.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 485559}, "asin": "B00063UEFM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/613HEQ99EZL._SX300_.jpg", "title": "The Complete Faerie Tale Theatre Collection (26 Titles)"}

{"description": "AsThat '70s Show's second season begins, Eric's buddy Hyde (Danny Masterson) and college dropout-sister Laurie (Lisa Robin Kelly) are still living with the Formans, but a few things have changed. Red (Kurtwood Smith) is about to lose his job, due to layoffs at the plant, and both the opening sequence and theme, \"That '70s Song\" (Cheap Trick's version of Big Star's \"In the Street\"), have been revamped. Otherwise, all the first season characters and their favorite hangouts, like Eric's basement and Vista Cruiser, are back. Granted, Red accidentally sells the car during season opener \"Garage Sale,\" but it isn't gone for long (blame Hyde's \"special\" brownies).As usual, the 1999-2000 season--1977-1978 in the show's chronology--was graced by a number of 1970s vets. \"Red's Last Day\" has singer Paul Anka and Lyle Waggoner (Wonder Woman), \"Halloween\" has Marion Ross (Happy Days),\" \"The First Time\" has Maud Adams (The Man With the Golden Gun), and \"Holy Crap\" has singer/actor Mac Davis (North Dallas Forty). Then there's Tommy Chong (Up in Smoke), who became a frequent guest, as Fotohut owner Leo, in five of the 26 episodes and would return for several more seasons. Yet another notable episode, \"Afterglow,\" features aScooby-Doo-styled animated sequence.By the end of the year, Eric (Topher Grace) and Donna (Laura Prepon) will have taken their relationship to the next level, Jackie (Mila Kunis) and Kelso (Ashton Kutcher) will have broken up, and Red will have gotten a job at the Pricemart--where he supervises Eric. The second season will end with a cliffhanger (\"Moon Over Point Place\") when Hyde is arrested (for something he didn&#x92;t actually do). The \"sticky\" situation will be resolved in the first episode of season three (\"Reefer Madness\").--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Two young sisters recovering from an unnamed trauma must face a mysterious past in this excellent South Korean shocker. A worldwide hit upon its release and based on an old Korean fairy tale; two sisters (wonderfully played by Su-jeong Lim and Geun-yeong Mun) come to live with their cold and distant father and turn-on-a-dime stepmother in a house where nothing is as it seems.   A wonderfully haunting score, starkly beautiful imagery, and a labyrinthine plot that twists and turns at every dark corner all set the stage for a riveting and often terrifying guessing game of a movie. Equal parts drama, mystery, and ghost story,A Tale of Two Sistersis a richly complex and challenging cinematic treat that may very well demand repeat viewings.--Matt Wold", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002P7UCJK", "B000GB5MOW", "B00005JNJR", "B000GBEWNY", "B0009WFEDC", "B004P2VQZ2", "B0000CC885", "B000MM0LH8", "B000LPS3B2", "B000BGH2A4", "B0009S2T0M", "B003Y7F1IW", "B000Q7ZKWU", "B0009KA2UO", "B000088NQR", "B000E0OE4O", "B000FS9FIA", "B000FVQYW2", "B0028DRGDQ", "B00DW5IM14", "B001570H5K", "B000CRR3ME", "B000H5U5YO", "B0015ET3YO", "B000CSTKHE", "B000274TLW", "B0007XBM8O", "B000AAF25S", "B001MEJY8W", "B000E3LGMY", "B000GSE6H4", "B003UTPL2A", "B004O63TWW", "B000NO243E", "B000MEYKCI", "B000NA28GG", "B003NLE5JA", "B006L4MWVE", "B001MYIXAC", "B0000CABGW", "B0009XRZQK", "B0014VPFVS", "B0009KQOZQ", "B002OMIKSG", "B000PKG8TW", "B000GI3RHY", "B00125WATQ", "B000H0M4CK", "B000FZEQEQ", "B002U041OE", "B0000AVHAO", "B000S0GYRU", "B004P2VQXE", "B000ARFPMQ", "B001VG2MAI", "B004ZKKKW4", "B0009A40PC", "B006C1S1DY", "B00006AUIG", "B000FZEQVY", "B001KEGR66", "B000FZEQFK", "B000MM0LHS", "B004H2CXBQ", "B003JDQJM8", "B000BVM240", "B001I82RVS", "B00C6WHPO4", "B000X1RYEQ", "B000A1OFZA", "B0007CNY2W", "B00AEFYYH6", "0783116926", "B008G1JIQC", "B008OTTVC2", "B004KDYR20", "B000A2XA8M", "B00006FDBW", "B0009W5KHW", "B003Q6D246", "B00BOYLIAC", "B00009MEC4", "B005SQRYB4", "B006L4MWTQ", "B000WC38EQ", "B006QWC2ZC", "B002OVO18A", "B002E2QH8G", "B00BTFK014", "B0007M23D8", "B0009X765K", "B0016K76V4", "B00A3TFMDI", "B002LMSWN2", "B002C8YSCE", "B001D5C1OO", "B00BSU0FQA", "B0001IXSZ0", "B00004W3HF", "B0002ZDW7Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0009S2T0M", "B002P7UCJK", "B000GBEWNY", "B004P2VQZ2"]}, "price": 12.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 124871}, "asin": "B0007M2374", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517GSMP9KRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Tale of Two Sisters (Deluxe Edition)"}
{"description": "Primerwon the Grand Jury Prize at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival and has drawn repeat viewers eager to crack writer-director-star Shane Carruth's puzzler of a time-travel drama. Carruth, an engineer by training, plays inventor Aaron, whose entrepreneurial partnership with fellow brainiac Abe (David Sullivan) unexpectedly results in a process for traveling back several hours in time. The men initially use these rewind sessions to succeed in the stock market. But a dark consequence of their daily journeys eventually complicates matters. If this sounds like a very commercial, science fiction thriller,Primeris anything but that. Shot on 16mm for $7,000, the film has a tantalizing, sealed-in logic, akin toMemento, that forces viewers to see the fantastic with a certain dispassion.

{"description": "By getting nominated for Academy Awards in both the Foreign Language Film and Best Song categories,Les Choristes(The Chorus) made a rare (for a European film) double impression at the 2004 Oscars. This sentimental tale follows the arrival of a new teacher at a remote boys school in 1949 France (the war is a largely unspoken but ghostly presence). With disciplinary problems rampant, and the policies of the old-fashioned headmaster not helping, Monsieur Mathieu decides to introduce choral singing as a way to bridge the gap with his students. You don't need a crystal ball to figure out where this will go, although the movie uses its atmospheric location and lush vocal arrangements well. Bald, dumpy Gerard Jugnot provides a refreshingly offbeat hero (though securely in the traditions of the My Most Memorable Teacher movie); he's sort of a younger Philippe Noiret. Director Christophe Barratier works in the winsome-cute mode that makes a certain kind of French movie into an overly sweet bon bon, although at least this bon bon sings.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00421IR5I", "B002AG2NTI", "B001THZAAI", "B0002S64SM", "B0087IT8FK", "B008A6QBZO", "B0009P7EI2", "B000296E7W", "B0009NSAF0", "B001AZJKKK", "B0069UV0AY", "B000I6BJ56", "B009CSVQ8Q", "B007I1Q59E", "B001CIOCLC", "B0000C9JFO", "B004SEUIXS", "B005V4X8PO", "B000YPUFBA", "B0000A1HQP", "B002LE8MGW", "B000UAE7MM", "B005HISOJ4", "B00005JPX8", "B000B58DHQ", "B004Y2SDX6", "B0000YEENU", "B00005JM48", "B0084O26SI", "B0007OMJPI", "B002W1HBM0", "B000SSQ7JC", "B00005OSLQ", "B004B3254Q", "B0089MUDM6", "B005CKW8BM", "B0007Z9QSA", "B000UVV26A", "B008H1Q3QY", "B0012Z361M", "B0002TSZMO", "B000I0RNV6", "B004YCKKIM", "B000053VBR", "B0049BKOIY", "B004ZBFRRG", "B0007Z0NYQ", "B004GFGUAE", "B0007A61K6", "B00L16P1I8", "B00AIBZLHS", "B000HIVIQU", "B00A92MEJY", "B00DNB1OSU", "B002VKB0M4", "B00ENMZK1A", "B002AG2NV6", "B00007J5VT", "B000MTEFP0", "B0002RQ316", "B000053VBN", "B003Y7D7BU", "B009NP1ZVG", "B000CSUNRU", "B0045NXMMQ", "B003H0ZHGM", "B0036TGSJE", "B0001BMLUA", "B002SF9YNO", "B00447851Q", "B004XVMCGW", "B0001IN0MQ", "B004UXUUDA", "B001APM44O", "B0009PBLU4", "B000YAA68W", "B00023GG6C", "B00G15MDI0", "B002AG2NU2", "0156013983", "B000HRMCUM", "B00782O7IY", "B001CQS7M4", "B00AWHDFLW", "B00005N89H", "B004JNZGFI", "B00F6SHGF8", "B00007KK52", "B00AEFY9RG", "B0019APR80", "B005S9EK5Y", "B000065R0U", "B008KQVGEU", "B00ATK0452", "B0019UGYAU", "B004ZG5EYC", "B00CXI8HMK", "B004SUDQ2W", "6305428352"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00421IR5I", "B001THZAAI", "B0087IT8FK", "B0002S64SM"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 72019}, "asin": "B0007NMJPO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61HKVBYA0WL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Chorus (Les Choristes)"}

{"description": "Sean Penn (looking rather Rupert Pupkin-like) is Samuel Bicke, whose life, circa 1974, has become unbearable. His wife (Naomi Watts) has left him, his dead-end sales job is killing him--even his best friend (Don Cheadle) has had enough. Bicke's a loser, but at least he's an honest one. Nixon, the epitome of dishonesty, becomes the locus of his rage, so Bicke devises a plan to eliminate him. Paul Schrader claims he finished writingTaxi Driverbefore the real-life Byck attempted to assassinate the president. Maybe so, but the similarities are hard to ignore (and \"Bickle\" sounds a lot like \"Byck\"). Niels Mueller (Tadpole) doesn't disguise the fact that his debut was inspired by the guy.

{"description": "The long-awaited emergence ofNightmare Alleyinto the light of DVD should achieve two things: make a legendary film noir available to a new generation, and restore the horrific charge to the lately watered-down termgeek, a concept that once had the power to give people very bad dreams indeed.To his lasting credit, Tyrone Power--20th Century Fox's extraordinarily handsome but not terribly interesting star of the '30s and '40s--begged for the chance to play Stan Carlisle, the predatory charmer who snakes his way through this bracingly unwholesome story. A spieler for--and lover of--carnival mind reader Zeena (Joan Blondell), he displays uncanny skill at \"reading\" the susceptible rubes, including a tough sheriff who turns to jelly after Stan psychs him out. Once Stan's mastered the intricate code used in Zeena's act, he's set to dump her for the younger, sexier Molly (Coleen Gray) and go bigtime as nightclub psychic \"Stanton the Great.\" After that, it's only a blasphemous bank shot to superstardom as a miracle worker with his own tabernacle and radio show.Few '40s films ventured as deeply into cynicism asNightmare Alley, or dealt so frankly with sexuality (with ripplings of polymorphous perversity yet) and power-tripping. The movie's rhythm is uncertain and Jules Furthman's screenplay telegraphs things, but the overall tone is remarkable, as are individual sequences: the freaky forced marriage of Stan and Molly in accordance with carny morality, and a creepy night scene in a park when Stanton the Great raises a ghost for a high-society client. Cinematographer Lee Garmes's chiaroscuro creates a relief map of the carnival world and what passes for life there. As for the geek... well, you'll find out whatgeekmeans. Stan does.--Richard T.

{"description": "From Hollywood's legendary Cocoanut Grove to the pioneering conquest of the wild blue yonder, Martin Scorsese'sThe Aviatorcelebrates old-school filmmaking at its finest. We say \"old school\" only because Scorsese's love of golden-age Hollywood is evident in his approach to his subject--Howard Hughes in his prime (played by Leonardo DiCaprio in his)--and especially in his technical mastery of the medium reflecting his love for classical filmmaking of the studio era. Even when he's using state-of-the-art digital trickery for the film's exciting flight scenes (including one of the most spectacular crashes ever filmed), Scorsese's meticulous attention to art direction and costume design suggests an impassioned pursuit of craftsmanship from a bygone era; every frame seems to glow with gilded detail. And while DiCaprio bears little physical resemblance to Hughes during the film's 20-year span (late 1920s to late '40s), he efficiently captures the eccentric millionaire's golden-boy essence, and his tragic descent into obsessive-compulsive seclusion. Bolstered by Cate Blanchett's uncannily accurate portrayal of Katharine Hepburn as Hughes' most beloved lover,The Aviatoris easily Scorsese's most accessible film, inviting mainstream popularity without compromising Scorsese's artistic reputation. As compelling crowd-pleasers go, it's a class act from start to finish.--Jeff ShannonDVD FeaturesIn his commentary track, director Martin Scorsese offers his own impressions of Howard Hughes and rattles off his memories of experiencing Hughes's films.  He mentions how he made Cate Blanchett watch every Katharine Hepburn film from the '30s on the big screen, and observes that Kate Beckinsale had \"a real sense of the stature of a Hollywood goddess.\"  But in general he doesn't talk much about the craft of making the film.  That area is covered better by editor Thelma Schoonmaker, who also appears on the commentary track, and producer Michael Mann makes a few appearances (all were recorded separately).  The picture is brilliant, but the 5.1 sound is not as aggressive in the rear speakers and subwoofer as one might expect, other than some nice surround effects in theHell's Angelsflying sequence.The second disc collects almost three hours of features.  There's one unnecessary deleted scene, and an 11-minute making-of featurette that's basically the cast and director heaping praise on each other.  More interesting are the short featurettes on visual effects (including the XF-11 scene, of course), production design, costumes, hair and makeup, and score, and Loudon Wainwright discusses his and his children's musical performances.  Historical perspective is provided by spotlights on Hughes's role in aviation and his obsessive-compulsive disorder, and a 43-minute Hughes documentary from the History Channel (part of the Modern Marvels series, it focuses on his mechanical innovations and spends less than a minute on his movies).  More unusual are DiCaprio and Scorsese's appearance on an OCD panel, and a half-hour interview segment DiCaprio did with Alan Alda.--David HoriuchiThe Personalities ofThe AviatorClick the links to explore more movies by these stars.Leonardo DiCaprioasHoward Hughes\"Sometimes I truly fear that I... am losing my mind.

{"description": "The Reivers, based on a William Faulkner novel, is a spirited comedy-drama starring Steve McQueen in a rare character part as Boon Hoggenbeck, a ne'er-do-well, turn-of-the-century Mississippi farm hand and cousin of 11-year-old naif Lucius McCaslin (Mitch Vogel). The arrival of a handsome new automobile purchased by Lucius' grandfather, Boss McCaslin (a golden performance by Will Geer), causes an uproar when Boon and another cousin, Ned McCaslin (Rupert Crosse), who is half African American, vie to drive the vehicle around town. Boss's departure by train for a funeral gives Boon, Ned, and Lucius an opportunity to drive in style to Memphis, where young McCaslin's eyes are opened to a larger world of hard-core racism, prostitution, corruption, and the tyranny of the powerful over the vulnerable. In short order, Lucius finds his innate decency and integrity lessen the sting of disillusionment and helplessness. Director Mark Rydell (On Golden Pond) keeps things brisk and breezy, but never loses sight of the long shadow of adulthood that blots out Lucius' innocence.

{"description": "Raw, uncompromising, and brutal, the fifth season ofOzrepresents a turning point for the series, tying up loose ends and preparing for the closure of season 6. As with all previous seasons of HBO's hard-edged prison series, the outbreaks of violence, racial tensions, emotional bleakness, and full-frontal male nudity ensure thatOzis decidedly not for the weak of heart. Simmering animosity between the Aryans, Muslims, Sicilians, and Latinos continues unabated; these eight episodes include numerous shankings and slashings, a severed arm, strangulation, a stabbing with a crucifix, and the death (among others) of one of the series' most prominent characters. As Schillinger (J.K. Simmons) and his skinheaded Aryans exploit a naive pair of new inmates, tensions mount between the weak-willed Omar (Michael Wright, in a standout performance) and his prone-to-rage Muslim mentor Kareem Said (Eamonn Walker, also excellent); Ryan O'Reily (Dean Winters) continues to protect his volatile brother Cyril (Scott William Winters) and reunites with his mother (Betty Lynn Buckley) who's in Oz doing community service; McManus (Terry Kinney) locks horns with his ex-wife over prison policy; Alvarez (Kirk Acevado) seeks partial redemption by training a guide-dog for the guard he blinded; and Keller (Christopher Meloni) returns to the \"Em City\" cellblock, to the relief of his bisexual lover Beecher (Lee Tergesen) who attends \"interaction\" sessions with Sister Pete (Rita Moreno) to encourage tenuous peace among inmates.With subplots involving guest stars Luke Perry, Peter Criss (from Kiss), Malachy McCourt, and others, the fifth season ofOzis weak at times, but series creator and primary writer Tom Fontana keeps a lot of characters in steady play, covering impressive dramatic territory after the relatively generous allotment of 16 episodes in Season 4. The series is clearly winding down here (the semi-musical episode \"Variety\" is a curious attempt to broaden the show's creative horizons, and works surprisingly well), and the outbreaks of violence now have a rather predictable and oppressive frequency. Anyone looking for \"feel good\" entertainment should stay away, but Fontana and the uniformly excellent cast maintain admirable depth of character and incident, including a tragic loss (in \"Visitation\") that resonates throughout the season. Extras are slim: commentary by Fontana and Dean Winters accompanies episode 8 (aptly titled \"Impotence\"), and like the fifth season itself, it's recommended primarily for devotedOzviewers who've enjoyed seasons 1-4.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000G1R4TS", "B00031TYBC", "B0000Y40PW", "B00000FBH2", "B00005Y6YJ", "0060521333", "B00A2JP6V2", "B00316DDYA", "B000QXDJLI", "B00123BY6S", "B000FTCLSU", "B0002ERXC2", "B0006IUD9Y", "B004YOEDR4", "B00ENSEJCU", "B0001KL5DA", "B00G4EWJ1O", "B0015TX2LO", "B0007YMVWO", "B003CN5SAY", "B000067S1G", "B005NFJAWG", "B00008PW1F", "B0007R4SWM", "B000UX6TK2", "B00G4EWNCO", "B00HW3EXCE", "B00EEDNR9A", "B004BZ5AHI", "B0013FSL16", "B00005NOHO", "B0012CJQZ0", "B00EIL7E9C", "B003XWEQ8E", "B0020TS5EM", "B0055SNHQG", "B00B52F278", "B005SEDI5M", "B00HX3ZJOY", "B002N57KGM", "B00DJYJRHG", "B00003CXOP", "B00C8CQRQ4", "B0047BXR30", "B0060MYKYY", "B007TBIUSM", "B008PJZDXW", "B0001O3YLM", "B001PQZYQI", "B0002I84JO", "B0009NZ2W4", "B000BO7DWI", "B0032JTV6A", "B003UD7J6W", "B00F4FFO8E", "0783230338", "B0016KCCCM", "B000NVT0UM", "B000V86OKG", "B0015ABRE2", "B0024FAD92", "B001AQBGM4", "B003L77GTC", "B000FFJYBQ", "B003PIUBZS", "B006CR2OOA", "B001OQCVFG", "B0058YPGSY", "B0038M2APA", "B0024FAR4I", "B000Q6GUW0", "B00ECHBSP8", "B00HQVB0Q4", "B0024FAD9C", "B000NA1VI2", "B00CMDPTS6", "B007HOQ5FQ", "B00280LZAE", "B0072OFM28", "B00F9F1K8W", "B0092Q82LC", "B00DXP7L88", "B0058YPG1G", "B0028RXXE8", "B000PMFS2I", "B00CWIMVDW", "B003FLQPVE", "B002FLOTPE", "B004YM6JSW", "B003L77GRO", "B00EAPC860", "B000063V8S", "B00FEP9MYG", "B000CNE0SS", "B00ADQPB50", "B000FIMG68", "B001LXIDWC", "B001CY5N00", "B0036TGTEI"], "bought_together": ["B000G1R4TS", "B00031TYBC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005Y6YJ", "B0000Y40PW", "B00000FBH2", "B00031TYBC"]}, "price": 27.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 54708}, "asin": "B0009GV9E6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WrCAhVTLL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Oz: Season 5"}

{"description": "One of the legendary landmarks of modern comedy finally gets a DVD airing:Beyond the Fringeis the sole filmed performance of the satirical revue that hatched at the Edinburgh Festival in 1960 and subsequently conquered London's West End and Broadway. The four young cut-ups thrown together for the sketch revue all went on to illustrious solo careers:  Peter Cook, Dudley Moore, Alan Bennett, and Jonathan Miller. Their success inspired a generation of comedians and helped birth satire as we know it.In general, the more topical humor contained in this performance has aged uncertainly, and doesn't seem especially remarkable in the wake of political satire of the 1960s and 70s. Still, the \"Aftermyth of War\" sketch, which traipses through World War II nostalgia in a way that ruffled feathers back then, remains a pre-Vietnam bit of jaundice. The show's absurdist humor comes through like gangbusters; the classic Peter Cook-Dudley Moore sketch, \"One Leg Too Few,\" about a one-legged man auditioning for the role of Tarzan, remains sublimely silly (\"I've got nothing against your right leg--the problem is, neither do you\").Moore provides song parodies, while Bennett's two soliloquies (a vicar's sermon and a man who slightly knew Lawrence of Arabia) perhaps prefigure his later monologues for theater and television. Cook has a pair of bona fide masterpieces. One casts him as a detective on the case of the Great Train Robbery (Bennett: \"So you feel thieves are responsible?\" Cook: \"Good heavens, no. I feel that thieves are totally irresponsible.\"). The other is \"Sitting on the Bench,\" the rambling musings of a miner disappointed at not have been a judge. As Cook stares frozen-faced at the audience for the duration of the piece, you may get the uncanny frisson of genius.The performance was recorded in London in 1964, during a final revival of the show. The technical quality is quite poor, but it hardly matters--this is the record of a seismic shift in comedy, and thus an essential disc.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0019MFY2M", "B0009GX1ZQ", "B0009GX20K", "B000MQ54M6", "B004H9X4CG", "B000EUMK9K", "B001GP5TMM", "B00062IVJE", "B002FE5XU6", "0767827724", "B000006SW2", "B004TPJMUQ", "0413146707", "B00J379KKW", "B0009XRZ92", "031231891X", "B000NA2758", "B000P0J0G0", "B00J2PQZEY", "B003DF44SI", "B003M45YZC", "B00GOYHQ44", "B00005O7NE", "B001LXIDUY", "B002KGREF6", "B0057XD86S", "B00EOBB7YY", "0099443252", "B00006AL5J", "B000026LRL", "1579129137", "B0024FADCE", "B004ULEEQG", "B00C3ALLDA", "B002LFPAUM", "B000CRR37Y", "B00003M5G9", "1844134008", "B00GMV8KGW", "B004H83IHS", "B0011VJRVU", "B002FE5XUG", "B000BHHVNQ", "B0050FXDDQ", "B002LFPAUC", "B00005O3VC", "B000Q6ZGL6", "B0040QYROA", "B0039A9M7K", "B002IVDLGY", "B00005NMVN", "B000G0O5EG", "B003NTUOGU", "B000A6T1WM", "B004ALIG2O", "B0009Y8JG4", "B001BEK8E2", "B000WC39V8", "B000059H9D", "B00E5G03I4", "0425256863", "B000E6ESJ4", "B001V7UXG2", "B000050BAQ", "B000FDEV48", "B000005IU2", "B002VXEC26", "B008K7RGA2", "B000026LRS", "B00CD6VY72", "B000006Y66", "B008CJ0JPW", "B000BR9S96", "B000WVPXAE", "B00028G6US", "6305918880", "B0039TD73G", "B006YZOXHQ", "B008Z0D5L8", "B008I34XUY", "B00004YVEK", "B00CTWSGA8", "B000025RE7", "0671203231", "B0000AISIV", "B001LXIDUO", "B00B1E6EAY", "B0040QYROK", "B008VIMLXM", "0151686564", "B004IB03ZO"], "bought_together": ["B0019MFY2M", "B0009GX1ZQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0019MFY2M", "B0009GX1ZQ", "B0009GX20K", "B000EUMK9K"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 43067}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.11, "brand": "ACORN MEDIA", "asin": "B000A6T1WW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518CKET5D6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Beyond the Fringe"}

{"description": "When it premiered on CBS on October 2, 1955,Alfred Hitchcock Presentswas an instant hit destined for long-term popularity. The series' original half-hour anthology format provided a perfect showcase for stories of mystery, suspense, and the macabre that reflected Hitchcock's established persona. Every Sunday at 9:30 p.m., the series began with the familiar theme of Gounod's \"Funeral March of a Marionette\" (which would thereafter be inextricably linked with Hitchcock), and as Hitchcock's trademark profile sketch was overshadowed by the familiar silhouette of Hitchcock himself, the weekly \"play\" opened and closed with the series' most popular feature: As a good-natured host whose inimitable presence made him a global celebrity, Hitchcock delivered droll, dryly sardonic introductions and epilogues to each week's episode, flawlessly written by James Allardyce and frequently taking polite pot-shots at CBS sponsors, or skirting around broadcast standards (which demanded that no crime could go unpunished) by humorously explaining how the show's killers and criminals were always brought to justice... though always with a nod and a wink to the viewer.This knowing complicity was Hitchcock's pact with his audience, and the secret to his (and the series') long-term success. It's also what attracted a stable of talented writers whose teleplays, both original and adapted, maintained a high standard of excellence. Hitchcock directed four of the first season's 39 episodes, including the premiere episode \"Revenge\" (a fan favorite, with futurePsychocostar Vera Miles) and the season highlight \"Breakdown,\" with Joseph Cotten as a car-accident victim, paralyzed and motionless, who's nearly left for dead; it's a perfect example of visual and narrative economy, executed with a master's touch. (The fourth episode, \"Don't Come Back Alive,\" is also a popular favorite, with the kind of sinister twist that became a series trademark.) Robert Stevenson directed the majority of the remaining episodes with similar skill, serving tightly plotted tales (selected by associate producers Joan Harrison and Norman Lloyd) by such literary greats as Ray Bradbury, Robert Bloch, Cornell Woolrich, Dorothy L. Sayers, and John Collier. Adding to the series' prestige was a weekly roster of new and seasoned stars, with first-season appearances by Cloris Leachman, Darren McGavin, Everett Sloane, Peter Lawford, Charles Bronson, Barry Fitzgerald, John Cassavetes, Joanne Woodward, Thelma Ritter, and a host of Hollywood's best-known character players. With such stellar talent on weekly display,Alfred Hitchcock Presentspaved the way forThriller,The Twilight Zone, and other series that maximized the anthology format's storytelling potential.Packed onto three double-sided DVDs, these 39 episodes hold up remarkably well, and while some prints show the wear and tear of syndication, they look and sound surprisingly good (although audio compression will cause many viewers to turn up the volume). The 15-minute bonus featurette, \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents: A Look Back\" is perfunctory at best, but it's nice to see new anecdotal interviews with Norman Lloyd, assistant director Hilton Green, and Hitchcock's daughter Pat (a frequent performer on these episodes), who survived to see their popular series benefit from the archival convenience of DVD.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000HDR814", "B000TXPXD2", "B002NPY7GS", "B005UL4NF2", "B00FEOYY8G", "B003NOGNQU", "B0002CX1M0", "B00BI3XZA0", "B0007CEXUY", "B001DXS4DI", "B002GSXKQA", "B000UVV25Q", "B000H5U5EE", "B006TBYC76", "B00KTZALDC", "B000A9QK7I", "B001HNDR4A", "B003VJTGNE", "B00BQK4YDC", "B005EVY8MQ", "B0002HOEPS", "B000A1INJE", "B0002NRRRE", "B00C6F61S2", "B000TJBNF8", "B00EEEHLKU", "B00JKTFQJM", "B000BC8T1E", "B001D8W7F4", "B00009VRF0", "B00IU6HQ4O", "B000MGBSDK", "B00CPTUN8S", "B00KBES386", "B007I8KXQ8", "B004CQZFL2", "B00JEZWRE4", "B0002J4ZX2", "B002DMJM7K", "B00016XN48", "B00068NVLQ", "B008OIQYXM", "B009OE2O0C", "B000F48D0U", "B00KE3B9US", "B00005JO3P", "B005D7E7Y0", "B00308B170", "B0030BS1E8", "B004IB04S0", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B0016MOWNM", "B00F6D62O4", "B009OE2NZI", "B00005JN8Q", "B000BQ5IXW", "B0008ENID4", "B001D8W7EK", "B00DZP1C18", "B0012KSUUO", "B00AQMGQVY", "B009OE2ODY", "B00BDZV4OW", "B00005JLIC", "B00E5G03I4", "B000QTCY7M", "B0044A5BPQ", "B005NHZAXM", "B008I34Y3K", "B001992NXI", "B001CQONOA", "B000IHYXJO", "B0002COTDA", "B00096S480", "B002ACKBU0", "B000LE16VC", "B005BUA1F8", "B000BF0C7A", "B009OE2NS0", "B008DCAG9M", "B005LVIP1E", "B001BN4WHW", "B000BGR1B4", "B009GGWW3W", "B00ARA4SLU", "B00BAXTYI0", "B000PHX5KU", "B001SLNPSO", "B001JAHPMG", "B000OPOAKW", "B00000JNUZ", "B001E6HUWK", "B00G5N6C8U", "B00000C0QO", "B00009Y3RE", "B000LXGXY8", "B008MIYKS0", "B000MGBSQM", "B000ECX0O2", "B00GSMZ3I8"], "bought_together": ["B000HDR814", "B000TXPXD2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005UL4NF2", "B000TXPXD2", "B002NPY7GS", "B00FEOYY8G"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30917}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 21.25, "brand": "HITCHCOCK,ALFRED", "asin": "B000AL733G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41nEauPqQpL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Alfred Hitchcock Presents - Season One"}

{"description": "You could call it a meeting or even a festival, but such words are entirely insufficient to describe the concept ofKumbh Mela. InShort Cut to Nirvana, Maurizio Benazzo and Nick Day take a loose, non-judgmental look at a gathering that has been taking place for over two millennia. As many as 70 million attended when they shot the film in 2001 (whittled down to 85 minutes from 3,500 hours of footage). The celebration takes place every 12 years, between the holy Indian rivers of the Ganges and the Yamuna. Even Mark Twain once made the trip. The documentary opens with his recollection of an 1895 Kumbh Mela: \"Pilgrims plodded for months to get here, worn, poor, and hungry, but sustained by unwavering faith.\" Then there's His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, who has attended twice, the first time in the 1960s. He came to learn about other religions and to promote harmony between them. He makes it clear that he isn't there to convert anyone, but rather to learn. The film's unofficial guide is Swami Krishnanand, a Hindu monk, who translates the messages of various yogis, sadhus, and other spiritual figures. He is joined by a couple of open-minded Westerners, Dyan Summers and Justin Davis, who share their thoughts about the experience with the filmmakers.Short Cut to Nirvanais a lively, impressionistic introduction to a monumental event.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "More than merely a sports documentary or an inspirational profile of triumph over adversity, \"Murderball\" offers a refreshing and progressive attitude toward disability while telling unforgettable stories about uniquely admirable people. It's ostensibly a film about quadriplegic rugby (or \"Murderball,\" as it was formerly known), in which players with at least \"some\" loss of physical function in all four limbs navigate modified wheelchairs in a hardcore, full-contact sport that takes them all the way to the Paralympic Games in Athens, Greece, in 2004. But as we get to know paralyzed or amputee players on Team USA like Andy Cohn, Scott Hogsett, Bob Lujano and charismatic team spokesman Mark Zupan, we come to understand that quad rugby is a saving grace for these determined competitors, who battle Team Canada coach (and former Team USA superstar) Joe Soares en route to the climactic contest in Athens. Simply put, \"Murderball\" is the best film to date about living with a severe disability, but codirectors Henry Alex Rubin and Dana Adam Shapiro avoid the sappy, inspirational sentiment that hampers nearly all mainstream films involving disability. By the time this blazing 85-minute film reaches its emotional conclusion, the issue of disability is almost irrelevant; these guys are as normal as anyone, and their life stories led to \"Murderball\" becoming the most critically acclaimed documentary of 2005. \"--Jeff Shannon\"", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002KE5VUS", "B000XQ4HR8", "B0007WFYBG", "B001E5FYS8", "B009YQJ2Q4", "B004YEMK7O", "B000BMY2NS", "B00005RIY3", "B00DUX290S", "B006JN8748", "B0007V6IUS", "B000A2XCBC", "B00007ELEK", "B008SGVSMM", "B00GV8B0OA", "B00GMV8DFU", "B00005JNV9", "B004YCKKIM", "B004U7MR1Y", "0786881623", "B0003JAO8Q", "B000CDSS18", "B0012LDNIC", "B002PLMJ74", "B00EPD3CC6", "0767846869", "B00DVLKMWQ", "B0000SXK0Y", "B0013LRKYO", "B001QTVP8A", "159486845X", "0472032364", "B00022FW4U", "0812924126", "B00AEK9BKQ", "B000189DZE", "0767821432", "B0001L3LUE", "B000MZGN40", "B004UXUV98", "B004IOPDJ2", "0803621795", "B008IG09FO", "0679728244", "B0087OULO6", "B002LE8MP8", "B000A3XY5A", "0240812417", "B00A92MGLA", "B0000WN13Q", "0470619007", "1932603336", "B000ELL1RG", "B0038M2AZA", "B00375LBK8", "1401812325", "B00CTBQUIE", "0814785646", "B002TVQ48A", "0807022020", "B0027BOL4G", "B008VR7U8O", "B001BEK8FQ", "B005S9EIGU", "B000FIMG7C", "B00009YXAS", "B001QIP5C8", "0814757286", "B00A4TMLKE", "B00020X94W", "B000GBEWMA", "B00005KHJY", "B0002OXVBO", "B007CEFTSA", "0781783518", "B0000YEEGM", "B00008DDVV", "B007UW9WOQ", "B002E01LOI", "0800177258", "B008JFUTT0", "B00AIBZKFG", "B0087IT8FK", "B004CJQVQC", "B00AEFZ63M", "B000E1NXJ0", "0822351110", "B001EP8EOY"], "bought_together": ["B000XQ4HR8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000GG1F4S", "B000XQ4HR8", "B001E5FYS8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 89146}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.89, "brand": "THINKFILM LLC", "asin": "B000B5XP24", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61YKSQPQ5PL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Murderball"}

{"description": "On the surface, David Cronenberg may seem an unlikely candidate to directA History of Violence, but dig deeper and you'll see that he's the right man for the job. As an intellectual seeker of meaning and an avowed believer in Darwinian survival of the fittest, Cronenberg knows that the story of mild-mannered small-town diner proprietor Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) is in fact a multilayered examination of inbred human behavior, beginning when Tom's skillful killing of two would-be robbers draws unwanted attention to his idyllic family life in rural Indiana. He's got a loving wife (Maria Bello) and young daughter (Heidi Hayes) who are about to learn things about Tom they hadn't suspected, and a teenage son (Ashton Holmes) who has inherited his father's most prominent survival trait, manifesting itself in ways he never expected. By the time Tom has come into contact with a scarred villain (Ed Harris) and connections that lead him to a half-crazy kingpin (William Hurt, in a spectacular cameo), Cronenberg has plumbed the dark depths of human nature so skillfully thatA History of Violencestands well above the graphic novel that inspired it (indeed, Cronenberg was unaware of the source material behind Josh Olson's chilling adaptation). With hard-hitting violence that's as sudden as it is graphically authentic, this isA History of Violencethat's worthy of serious study and widespread acclaim.--Jeff ShannonOn the DVDOn a single disc and with little fanfare, this DVD makes an excellent case for the best extras of the year. Dive into the one-hour-long documentary and learn more about moviemaking than on many a double-disc. The secret lies in director David Cronenberg's (and his usual crew) folksy casualness in showing off the craft, be it makeup (green screens were used), directing (Cronenberg doesn't storyboard), or art direction (the diner set). It also is very funny to hear about \"fish Fridays\" and how Maria Bello's Uncle Pete became an influence. Even the infamous sex-on-the-staircase scene is diagnosed with candor as stars Viggo Mortensen and Bello act as if there is no backstage camera. There's only one deleted scene, but it's uncommonly deconstructed on why it was filmed and why it was cut (it's a very Cronenbergian dream sequence). A short bit on Cannes is also a delight. So much is here that Cronenberg's smart commentary track is nearly superfluous. Isn't that a nice surprise?--Doug ThomasMore to ExploreThe Graphic NovelOther Graphic Novels that Inspired MoviesDavid Cronenberg EssentialsWhy We Love Maria BelloThe work of Viggo MortensenThe work of William HurtStills fromA History of ViolenceViggo Mortensoe as Tom StallAshton Holmes as Jack Stall and Kyle Schmid as Bobby JordanWilliam Hurt as Richie CusackEd Harris as Carl Fogarty and Viggo Mortensen as Tom StallMaria Bello as Edie StallDirector David Cronenberg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000YENUI6", "B001LRJH0U", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B008R65XP6", "B004SIP8ZM", "B001FB5634", "B0001EFV7C", "B00004W18Z", "B001EIOOWC", "6301971345", "B000M341QE", "B00000K31T", "B000GFLKF8", "B000P0J0D8", "0767802519", "B004SUDQ72", "B003ASLJQS", "B002PJYPYG", "6304698747", "B000F5WR4W", "B003Y5H4R0", "B0018O4YT0", "B00AEBB9CS", "B0028OH568", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00000JDIQ", "B000FUTVLY", "B002AT8KAG", "B000XR9L50", "6305313687", "0783228457", "B002QEHPQU", "B001FB55L2", "B000Y7WGOW", "B002VWNIEA", "B00022XE6S", "B006PTL1QM", "B000P0J0AG", "B004499LX0", "B00005JMOW", "B002T9H2LA", "B001TOD92C", "B005OK721G", "B000FKO5QK", "B0019EXZY4", "B002ZG99N6", "B0007DFJ0G", "B003LR5BD0", "B003RHZ6F2", "B00AEFY5B6", "B000N6TX1I", "0792833279", "B005LAIIJY", "B000FVQM2Y", "B000FC2FX8", "B001BNFRB2", "B00005JN0W", "B002XMGGK6", "B00007E8UI", "B0064NTZQ2", "B00D3DJIG8", "B0010DR4BO", "B0013XZ6X4", "B00AEFXE9U", "B007D5E7C2", "B000ALM40I", "B00001ZWUS", "B00005V9HH", "B00008RH3L", "0783229402", "B000QXDCLK", "B000P0J0EW", "B000BBOUUE", "B000A7DVR2", "B000K7VHQ4", "B00000F4MA", "B000XA5K48", "B00004XPPB", "B0002IQMAM", "B00029LNYQ", "B00003CXWV", "B004XQO90O", "B000GIW9I2", "B004U7MR14", "B002DKGWSE", "B0064MT1FI", "B0000TANUI", "B009T3AE1Y", "B0000VLKVM", "B00006LPGP", "B00005JLRE", "B000F7CMRM", "B00AEFXESQ", "B001DZOC64", "1558908315", "B0036TGTDE", "B000NOKFHQ", "B008220DGE", "B00007AJE1", "B000BVM1S2"], "bought_together": ["B000YENUI6", "B001LRJH0U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000YENUI6", "B008MILL78", "B009T3AE1Y", "B000M341QE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 45602}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.36, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B000CQLZ0Q", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51g0dghsrYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A History of Violence (New Line Platinum Series) [DVD]"}

{"description": "Rent, the show that in 1996 gave voice to a Broadway generation, has finally become an energetic, passionate, and touching movie musical. Based loosely on Puccini'sLa Boh&#xE8;me, it focuses on the year in the life of a group of friends in New York's East Village--\"bohemians\" who live carefree lives of art, music, sex, and drugs. Well, carefree until Mark, an aspiring filmmaker (Anthony Rapp), and Roger, an aspiring songwriter (Adam Pascal), find out they owe a year's rent to Benny (Taye Diggs), a former friend who had promised them free residence when he married the landlord's daughter. Roger has also attracted the attention of his downstairs neighbor, Mimi (Rosario Dawson), while Mark's former girlfriend, Maureen (Idina Menzel), has found a new romance in a lawyer named Joanne (Tracie Thoms). Philosophy professor Tom (Jesse L. Martin) finds his soul mate in drag queen Angel (Wilson Jermaine Heredia). But because this is the late-'80s, the threat of AIDS is always present.The remarkable thing aboutRentthe movie is that nearly 10 years after the show debuted onBroadway, six of the eight principals return in the roles they originated. They're a bit older than would be ideal for their characters, but they do have the advantage of having learned the show directly from creator Jonathan Larson (who died of an aortic aneurysm while the show was in previews), plus they started young--we're not exactly talking Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford here.  Alongside a polished performance like Rapp's--sometimes observer-commentator, sometimes participant in two of the score's showstoppers, \"The Tango Maureen\" and \"La Vie Boheme\"--the two new additions (Thoms in place of Fredi Walker, Dawson in place of the edgier Daphne Rubin-Vega) slip comfortably into the ensemble; the pivotal Dawson makes a seductive case as Mimi when she tempts Roger in the mesmerizing \"Light My Candle\" or burns up the stage of the Catscratch Club in \"Out Tonight.\"  Moviegoers who have an aversion to people who break into song while walking down the street probably won't have their minds changed byRent(even if they are singingrocksongs), and the gritty subject matter and lack of big-name stars make it unlikely to cross over to general audiences the wayChicagodid.  But fans of musicals should find \"Seasons of Love\" as stirring as ever, and the show's passionate admirers--the \"Rentheads\"--probably couldn't have wished for a more sympathetic director thanRentfan Chris Columbus, or a more faithful representation of the show they love.--David HoriuchiOn the DVDThree powerful musical numbers cut from the final film are the highlight of the two-disc DVD.  In the aftermath of the funeral scene, Anthony Rapp sings \"Halloween,\" and he, Adam Pascal, and Rosario Dawson share \"Goodbye Love\" (both songs were in the stage version). Then in an alternate ending, the cast finishes \"No Day But Today\" on the bare stage on which the film began.  There are worthwhile arguments for why these scenes were cut or replaced, so it's fortunate that the DVD lets us see these at all.  Those musical numbers have optional commentary by director Chris Columbus, Rapp, and Pascal (two other cut scenes have no commentary), including one funny moment in which Rapp explains in great detail the technical challenge of shooting \"Halloween\" only to have Columbus say, \"Yeah, but I don't know if that's the take we used.\"  The three also provide commentary on the film itself, with Columbus discussing various decisions, criticizing the critics, and marveling \"I still don't know how we got the PG-13,\" and Rapp and Pascal occasionally recalling differences in the stage version.The other whopper of a feature isNo Day But Today, a nearly two-hour documentary that uses video clips, still photographs, and interviews with family and friends to celebrate the short life of Jonathan Larson and his creation.  Topics include his early interest in musical theater (\"I want to write theHairfor the '90s.\"), the support of Stephen Sondheim, the impact of the AIDS epidemic, the long and difficult road ofRent(casting the show, Larson learning to collaborate, the transfer to a Broadway stage, and the Rentheads), and Larson's tragic death. The last 20 minutes covers the making of the film, director Chris Columbus, the decision to rely on most of the original cast (the only two principals who didn't appear in the movie, Daphne Rubin-Vega and Fredi Walker-Browne, are interviewed in earlier segments, but only mentioned in passing here), recording sessions, and location shooting.  If the movie ofRentwas a tribute to Jonathan Larson, the DVD is all that and more, a moving and incredibly detailed look at an extraordinary talent whom the world lost far too soon.--David HoriuchiMoreRentMovie soundtrackOriginal Broadway cast recordingAnthony Rapp'sWithout You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical \"Rent\"", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001LMAKAG", "B000AYEI4U", "B006ZZQMXS", "B000005ALT", "B004SEUJBE", "B0007TKNII", "B000077VR3", "B002D0L0R2", "0688154379", "B00AEBBAEK", "B000Z8R2VW", "B002G1K82Q", "B00GM7ZFAA", "B00JAOW3MA", "B00006D295", "B005S9EK5Y", "B0028SVXVM", "B00004XMTJ", "B001MT7ZEW", "B001GKJ2DY", "B006Z21ZFG", "6304806418", "0743269772", "B0000AM6IY", "B0000TB01Y", "B00070HK24", "B002NZK5TG", "B002ZG976U", "B00AEFY5TI", "B000EWBKMG", "B00008973A", "1423406265", "B00AEFXTKO", "B0013Z7RUC", "B00004W5VC", "B00GTO6WXU", "B000I2J6YG", "B000RPCK2E", "0800141806", "0743269764", "B00028HBIO", "0783240287", "B0007WFXZI", "0792841638", "B005QIOKBQ", "1938438175", "B005SFR7YE", "B003L77GAQ", "B001FB55OE", "B000E3LHSM", "B00001PE59", "0767827929", "B000J3OTSM", "B000UAE7NG", "B005LAIHR2", "B009NYF2GQ", "B00005JOFQ", "B002ZG99IG", "B0000VCZKM", "B00005O3VD", "B001HN69AY", "B000FIHN5M", "B0011U52E2", "B0000524E5", "B003H6Z0PO", "B006WZIB1C", "B004D9FLJE", "0061350966", "B0053O8A5K", "B001CTA1UM", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00133KFGW", "B000URDCC6", "B001LMAKAQ", "B0009JE57G", "B009LDD5E0", "B00003CYJ4", "B00001PE4D", "B005PTMPYA", "B00005OCMS", "B004VJJFDE", "B00003CXHG", "B00447L4KA", "B0002E5O9G", "B0009IOR6Q", "B001FAFO3W", "B005BUA1HQ", "B00C81AVNU", "B00004RF9K", "B00166UFSY", "B002D0L0QS", "B00AMEZDJW", "B00006RIO7", "B00FGEO7OK", "B000683VI4", "B001JV5BF8", "B00005UQ9W", "B00GB0ORJ8"], "bought_together": ["B001LMAKAG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001LMAKAG", "B000077VR3", "B004SEUIWO", "B005SFR7YE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7679}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.86, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000E1YVZU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61ZTKXS4AGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rent (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)"}
{"description": "A Perfect Spyis a captivating, straight-ahead adaptation of John Le Carr&#xE9;'s novel about the development of a Cold War double agent, Magnus Pym, whose life since childhood has taught him the art and elements of deceit. Peter Egan (Bean: The Movie) plays the adult Pym, raised in part by his con-man father, Rick (Ray McAnally), and the latter's community of accomplices. Stranded in Vienna while working an angle for Rick that goes wrong, young Magnus (Benedict Taylor) makes a connection with a down-on-his-luck writer, Axel (Rudinger Weigang). That relationship will come back to haunt him when Axel--later a Communist spy--recruits Magnus to divide his loyalties between East and West.Typical of a Le Carr&#xE9; drama, the role of nature versus nurture in the spy business is a complex and fascinating mystery. Magnus has always been a talented liar--it was part of his survival in childhood--and seems most comfortable infiltrating others' secrets and tempting danger. But he is slowly and effortlessly outsmarted by those who know how to maneuver a man into a corner before he realizes he has run out of options. The cast of this 1988 British television miniseries is the best thing about the production, especially McAnally (My Left Foot), who died the following year. Arthur Hopcraft's smooth adaptation of Le Carr&#xE9;'s story keeps the sometimes complicated narrative accessible,--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00061QJ8A", "B005DXCOKS", "B001EOQCJE", "B005DXCO94", "B002EAYE42", "B00005R5GM", "B008I34YTY", "B0011VJRVU", "B000742FZW", "B000C65Z1G", "B001LMAK6A", "B000HT3PBU", "B006Z4LP72", "B004IFYN1A", "B0059XTTW8", "B00CWEPZUC", "B009Z59ZNE", "B000UEE6TC", "B000YRY8BG", "B00003CXWG", "B00J3M54AW", "B008RO6PJQ", "B004OB2EYQ", "B00FNR9ZKG", "0143119761", "B00KHA99BY", "B000OYAT3U", "B000PFUAPK", "B00000K3C9", "0143122576", "B00GD7UO6E", "B00JJRLFTU", "B0083HXKAY", "0783226853", "B000KF0DVQ", "B00441GYYC", "B000MXPE7O", "B00B5A9FNM", "B006JY3OBI", "B0000C23D5", "B0070MZ0G0", "B00BQXTCVS", "0143122584", "B00JPJC8RK", "0792840445", "B00007LV9M", "0670014893", "B009DS6YGO", "B00GWXI1F0", "B00C888LOO", "B00JJRLG7G", "B00BVMX96I", "B00IBKXQJS", "B00ECXJC1E", "B00BCXW106", "B007G5K066", "B00D7AM2YW", "B0028AEO0M", "B006JY3OH2", "B000H1RFQ4", "B00A8KJLPM", "B00H4ZEFTQ", "B009DS3VQA", "B005DJ7AYC", "0143119737", "B00009WNVO", "B00GAXASK8", "B008645ZXY", "B00CPTUO14", "B009YX8MKO", "B00AATFJKC", "B00005QCVP", "B0046MOVE4", "B00HGE90Z4", "B003JLL2R2", "B000035P5E", "B00287Z19I", "B00JJRLFVS", "B00D49YBTA", "B004AV5H3U", "B00AHREQMY", "B003T6LHWC", "B00JPNU8P0", "B000641YUU", "0517146975", "B00ANGICCO", "0394588428", "B004O0CJYM", "B00004ZBVK", "B00A27OJ94", "B00D49YDR0", "B0050N0US4", "0394577892", "B00J5LXT44", "B00DDUF4G4", "B000063BME", "B00EUI4XHE", "B00CPTUO5K", "B001LXIDUO", "B0000AUHPB"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005DXCO94", "B005DXCOKS", "B00061QJ8A", "B001EOQCJE"]}, "price": 25.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 86664}, "asin": "B000E1ZB9U", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NVAG0NTPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "John Le Carre's A Perfect Spy"}
{"description": "WhetherAmerican Dad!will ever enjoyFamily Guy's cult status  remains to be seen, but the first 13 episodes of its inaugural season,  collected in this extras-laden three-disc set, are promising. After a few  episodes, CIA agent Stan Smith and family gradually emerge from the Griffins' formidable shadow, and the show finds its own comic voice. And it sounds a lot like Paul Lynde. That would be Roger (voiced by Seth McFarlane), the housebound alien who saved Stan's life at Area 51 and now lives with the Smiths. Not as inspired a creation is Klaus, the German-accented goldfish who lusts after Stan's wife, Francine. He does, though, have an inspired meta-moment in the episode \"Bullocks to Stan,\" in which he provides faux scene-specific commentary (during the episode!) in anticipation of the show's release on DVD (\"I wasn't sure about the Squeaky Fromme reference,\" he offers, \"but it's a smart joke, and the fans have come to expect that from us\"). As for the rest of the clan, Steve's children are the typical dysfunctional siblings: Steve, a socially awkward geek, and Hayley, a liberal counterpoint to red, white, and blue-blooded Stan--at least liberal enough to sleep with Stan's boss, Bullock (playfully voiced by Patrick Stewart) in the episode \"Bullocks to Stan.\"Though the jokes inAmerican Dad!are not as free-associative as inFamily Guy, McFarlane cannot seem to resist dispensing with character integrity for a gratuitous potshot at, say, Lisa Kudrow. But as withFamily Guy,American Dad!tears at the sitcom envelope. The blasphemous episode \"Deacon Stan, Jesus Man,\" had the distinction of being voted \"Worst TV Show of the Week\" by the Parents Television Council. AndAmerican Dad!has its own version ofFamily Guy's surreal titanic bouts between Peter Griffin and that chicken. The episode \"Homeland Insecurity\" features a digression in which a Department of Water and Power worker greedily kills his partner over a gem-encrusted gold \"turd,\" only to find out his wife is having an affair. As he wails to the heavens, the words \"To be continued\" appear onscreen. According to the audio commentary, the writers do indeed intend to continue this compelling soap opera. So that's something to look forward to.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000NNK4DM", "B0012KSUTA", "B001RIZ7OI", "B003CN5B7E", "B003L77G7Y", "B0053O8A32", "B00BYNL8DU", "B00LFW6BA0", "B000083C6V", "B000HT3P6U", "B001VFM0ZG", "B000AQ68Z0", "B000RO6JZO", "B002JVWQYG", "B00008YGRV", "B0012018OE", "B003DZX46G", "B003L77G9W", "B0058RN7KA", "B0058YPMHO", "B00E0FW054", "B00FR81Z40", "B003V3FVQ6", "B008412UKA", "B000A3DFV8", "B008412UQ4", "B001RP976A", "B00BI5YEWG", "B00HDU9UOW", "B00775R45A", "B007ZFR67I", "B00023P49C", "B00008YGRS", "B0000AQS81", "B0001ZWLVU", "B0000CABL2", "B000ADWCYY", "B0001MZ7KA", "B004696M94", "B002HQK5O6", "B00005JM3G", "B00023P49M", "B00CO8WWS4", "B000KLQUMQ", "B007KFZ85K", "B0006Z2L2Y", "B008AITJ7O", "B005QIOJUI", "B00K8HAJN8", "B000AQ68VO", "B003X4KHRG", "B009SQ9Q5M", "B00363WGB4", "B000CNESM6", "B0040JHX0W", "B0002WZRSG", "B00F77MAO0", "B001N9VW5Y", "B00J5LXPPM", "B0007PAM06", "B000RPD0DC", "B0002XVQT4", "B000E0OE3K", "B000FSME2Y", "B000EHSVDC", "B0006B41GM", "B000RW3VDE", "B000R7I3XC", "B000F8O2QK", "B007KFZ7UQ", "B00F4NPBI4", "B006W93ELK", "B001BGS17G", "B002LARYTW", "B001L1S1PI", "B000ABKHZC", "B001G0MFFG", "B000RZIGX6", "B00008YGRZ", "B003KZ27N0", "B0007CILMA", "B00158K0V0", "B000067DNE", "B001O0TWXG", "B007KFZ8B4", "B000S76LKI", "B007KFZ7PG", "B000A6T27G", "B0024FAR52", "B0016KCCCM", "B00008EY6Q", "B0018O5WUU", "B005CHTXWC", "B0036TGTEI", "B004MLEYTG", "B007KFZ7YM", "B000B5XOR0", "B005QIOJ3A", "B000UZDO62", "B00DNQCH0Y"], "bought_together": ["B000NNK4DM", "B0012KSUTA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003L77G7Y", "B000083C6V", "B000NNK4DM", "B000AQ68Z0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 67450}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.59, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B000E6ES9O", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KK1TPJ7RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "American Dad!, Vol. 1"}

{"description": "Any fan of Steve Martin's2000 novellawill enjoy this pitch-perfect adaptation, which glowingly captures the bittersweet tones of a May-December romance. Martin wrote the screenplay and stars as Ray Porter, a button-down 50-something executive who reaches out to a much younger woman as a Los Angeles playmate. The book and movie, though, are both primarily about Mirabelle (Claire Danes), a 20-something with a pile of promises, debt, and depression, as she fades away into a slow corner of Saks selling unneeded formal gloves. She's a wisp of a person, with a cat who doesn&#x92;t love her, and when she finds a suitor, it's Jeremy (Jason Schwartzman), a scruffy artist who babbles on about speakers. When the gentlemanly Porter calls, his appearance in her life begins to make her whole. It also immediately sets her up for sadness--Ray thinks of Mirabella as a precious outlet for sex, while Mirabelle, very mistakenly, sees Ray as a potential lifelong mate. Martin deftly turns the novella's prose into dialogue, allowing the movie to feel full-bodied, and the film also works as a comedy, as we witness Jeremy's growth on the road with a rock band. Schwartzman would walk away with film if not for the perfectly cast leads: Martin does another smart turn away from his wild-and-crazy moniker, Danes has never been better in an Oscar-worthy performance, and Bridgette Wilson-Sampras aces her role as a hot-to-trot co-worker of Mirabelle's. Whoever's decision to have Martin be the omnipresent narrator, though, should be penalized, as it&#x92;s confusing to have him in two roles, and the information is pretty useless, even robbing the film of a final grace note.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000F5FNPC", "B000F6IODE", "B000BYY11Y", "B00079HZUM", "B00008979G", "B000V6LSOA", "B003BZ58RQ", "B005Z9MH7U", "B0012BR8DI", "B0000797IO", "B000VY1EYG", "0786891076", "B000062WWZ", "B00081U7HC", "B00005JMJ4", "B004499LX0", "B00B9ZD73M", "B0016MJ6HY", "B0064MT1FI", "B000EQHXNW", "0767818105", "B00005JMWP", "B000BX8R10", "B0038N9WKU", "B000056BSJ", "1419897543", "B00ADRYCWC", "B004L3AR0K", "B002ONC9NC", "0783227353", "B000NIVJFY", "B00IKM5OCO", "B005Z9MGRG", "6305428239", "B0002KPIQY", "B000CNESJO", "B000035Z3C", "B000EDWKXI", "B0010X8NF0", "078322740X", "B000053VB5", "B00AEFY8MM", "B00007JXWX", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B000BBOUUE", "B001UV4XGU", "0786866586", "B000IU37SO", "0783229402", "B0071HPP3M", "B00IXD2LJY", "B000ADWDFC", "B000GFRI54", "B0000640VJ", "6305308802", "B000067J1O", "B004XVMCKS", "B002T51X4Q", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B0001Z4P2I", "B004XVMCK8", "B000B8QG22", "B003Z8ZC2A", "B001KP2J2G", "B004D45NYC", "B00005JMBQ", "B00AEBB8P6", "B00005JL7Q", "B00007AJE1", "B00BMKGZVA", "B00BEIYGK2", "B000CS45TW", "B00005JMJD", "B00005KHJJ", "B00319ECBK", "B0068MNO2U", "B004LWZWBU", "B0013D8LCC", "B004GJYRA0", "B000LXHK2C", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B001P3SA8K", "B003Y5H574", "B000T988I8", "B002ZFEQ76", "B001URA5Y8", "B002ZG99UE", "B00G3DA5XA", "0767815122", "B001UV4XUG", "B00AEBB9G4", "B00FWSWIUU", "B0001O3YV2", "B00AADAEBW", "B00008972P", "B001MM3AZM", "B00AEFXJ86", "B00A18CG76", "B004H83IG4", "B00803PFWM"], "bought_together": ["B000F6IODE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0786866586", "B00079HZUM", "B007HW18CS", "B002WY65VA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30533}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.45, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B000EDWKX8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51vVNaGhmPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Shopgirl"}

{"description": "One of the most popular story arcs fromDoctor Who's \"Fourth Doctor\" period (starring Tom Baker as the Doctor), writer Terry Nation'sGenesis of the Daleksnot only fleshes out the back story of the Doctor's most fearsome nemeses--the megalomaniacal, robotic Daleks--but also serves up a thoughtful storyline that doesn't skimp on the action. First aired on the BBC in 1975, the six-episode story has the Doctor and companions Sarah Jane (Elisabeth Sladen) and Harry (Ian Marter) summoned to the Daleks' home planet of Skaros at a time prior to their rise to power. Hoping to prevent the domination-hungry beings from developing their warlike behavior, they soon find themselves in the middle of a war between two races, the Kaleds and the Thals, and uncover a plot by a Kaled scientist, Davros, to render his people invincible as the metal-encased Daleks. A gripping story with elements that remain topical even today (ancient cultures locked in an endless war, genetic experimentation, eugenics),Genesis of the Daleksis an excellent starting point for first-timeWhoviewers, and a fine reminder of the show at its best for longtime fans. The two-disc DVD offers a considerable amount of extras, most notably a commentary track by Baker, Sladen, co-star Peter Miles, and director David Maloney. \"Genesis of a Classic\" is an hour-long featurette about the story, with interviews from all the major (surviving) cast and crew members, while \"The Dalek Tapes\" explores the creatures' history via rare clips and interviews with performers and production staff. There's also a clip from a vintage episode of the U.K. children's seriesBlue Peterthat's devoted toDoctor Whomodels and creatures, as well as the detailed photo gallery and subtitled text commentary that are standards on allDoctor WhoDVDs. Those with DVD-ROM can access PDF documents of the 1976Doctor Who Annualand listings from theRadio Times.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001Q9ECM6", "B000KGGIRI", "B000QGE8II", "B000067FPC", "B0002F6BSS", "B00114XLZK", "B001C71IGA", "B000Z7G87C", "B005KQVE2C", "B001QCWQ58", "B001Q9ECNA", "B00C6ACUF0", "B0055ASXLI", "B000GRUQM4", "B001QCWQ5I", "B001Q9ECNK", "B005SH63H4", "B0009PVZFK", "B008FTX6PO", "B001K2KM9Q", "B001AGXEBU", "B000B7QCJ0", "B001AGXEBK", "B00114XLYQ", "B001QCWQ5S", "B0017XOFGE", "B000Z7G87W", "B000EMG91I", "B007VI74VM", "B00272NJ7K", "B001QCWQ62", "B005SJGI6I", "B005SH62X4", "B004L9GMC6", "B0000ADXG3", "B00ANDGYRM", "B000NJXG8G", "B0007VY47C", "B00272NJ66", "B001C71IGU", "B00272NJ6Q", "B005SH664E", "B00ANDM41M", "B00272NJ6G", "B002VXEC9O", "B0051V55XA", "B009RZ160W", "B005SH63I8", "B005KQVD3M", "B0035JHYPW", "B007AAEZY0", "B00C6ACXAM", "B00IO998U2", "B0035JHYMA", "B005SJGI90", "B001U3ZYXY", "B000TSTEOG", "B005SJGI8Q", "B000NJXG7W", "B002IW62FK", "B008RO876U", "B00CDEJRDC", "B00C6ACT3I", "B002PHVHKI", "B0009PVZG4", "B00C6ACVWM", "B005F265IO", "B008D1Q1XI", "B00142UZ9Y", "B004MA1JZY", "B00C6ACV0E", "B004L9GMBW", "B002IW62FU", "B003EGDDLA", "B001GJ4U50", "B0083SI9AO", "B0072BNJGC", "B00147F8YQ", "B000QGE8I8", "B0049S1NXW", "B004GJYRDM", "B0013XZ6T8", "B00447G2X4", "B005SH646Y", "B00C6ACUQ4", "B00114XLZU", "B003X3BYME", "B007AAF2ZG", "B004GJYRGO", "B008D1Q1U6", "B002PHVHK8", "B003O97W2S", "B0049S1NYG", "B004UOHNES", "B005SJGI7C", "B000GRUQME", "B001GJ4U4Q", "B000TSTEOQ", "B003DZX41G", "B004MA1K2G"], "bought_together": ["B001Q9ECM6", "B000KGGIRI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000QGE8II", "B000067FPC", "B000KGGIRI", "B00ANDGYRM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 13243}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 21.19, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000EMG918", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51APQ4CHXQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Doctor Who: Genesis of the Daleks (Story 78)"}

{"description": "BeforeDegrassi Junior HighandSeventh Heaven, there wasThe Facts of Life--a feel-good sitcom where a lesson was learned at the end of each episode. Set in an all-girl boarding school, the series spanned nine seasons, countless hairdos, and an array of cast members and guest stars--some of whom (George Clooney, Helen Hunt, Molly Ringwald) would become very, very famous in the future. But in the 29 episodes that cover the first two seasons, the series introduces TV viewers to characters that represent girls everyone knows--Blair, the rich, spoiled girl; Natalie, the chubby smart aleck; Jo, the rebellious tomboy; and Tootie, the rollerskating tattletale.A spin-off ofDiff'rent Strokes,The Facts of Lifewas designed as a showcase for Charlotte Rae, who played jack-of-all-trades den mother Edna Garrett. But the show's central plots all revolved around the girls. Back in 1979, certain words weren't common on television. So when Blair tries to make a schoolmate feel bad, insinuating that the girl is a lesbian, she uses the word \"strange\" instead of the \"L\" word. The series is a coming-of-age story that plays to its target audience of teenage girls. While much of the humor isn't very sophisticated, the homespun messages the show spread are right on target, whether it's dealing with eating disorders, sexual promiscuity, or acknowledging that handicapped people are people, too. From 1979 to 1988, the girls would grow into young women who go to college, get jobs, and lose their virginity (not necessarily in that order). But in the early seasons, there's a sweet innocence that still rings true today.--Jae-Ha Kim", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000HIVIOC", "B001993YB8", "B003XL6EI0", "B0002JZT5U", "B000OVLBH6", "B000CELOW2", "B000C6NPHC", "B0001Z3I1C", "B000CELOVI", "B000CCBCCQ", "B007RMQ4HW", "B000K7UBXE", "B0000DFZ5O", "B000VWQU88", "B00008EYBH", "B004GJYR82", "B00465I1D8", "B008VIMLRI", "B00005JNIS", "B00005JO4F", "B000SQFC0O", "B000EU1QC2", "B001LRL4WY", "B00GOC75YW", "B00020X83Y", "B00IJZW35I", "B001GP5TMW", "B001NPK5BU", "B0089BSLKS", "B00008R9MC", "B00CVB6XDO", "B007JNZYPM", "B00I099K4U", "B0000ZMH92", "B00005JO2V", "B000068V9X", "B000291Q3Y", "B000291Q3O", "B00151QYT4", "B003L2YUR8", "B00K31RC0W", "B0006N2F0E", "B0002O7Y8U", "B0009X7BEG", "B000DZ95IU", "B0001O3YHQ", "B0066E6SSC", "B0002Y4T7O", "B000FA57U8", "B000B8IA3U", "B0006Z2L4W", "B0000AKY3Q", "B000NJMJHA", "B000MGBSEY", "B00005JOQZ", "B000Z6GT18", "B002JH2EHO", "B000OVLBGW", "B000FJAAHY", "B0009X7BEQ", "B00BUWD7NE", "B004NJC0IO", "B0002RQ3MU", "B0007WFXL2", "B0007WQHFS", "B00DXLO0BI", "B002ACKBTG", "B000H1RFXM", "B00D2UMHB0", "B000M343AS", "B000EGDAO8", "B000Y7U9AK", "B00007KK5I", "B001CQONNG", "B0066E6THW", "B005XLFB32", "B00008WJEZ", "B0007ZSHR6", "B000Q6GUJS", "B0002I837M", "B000BB1MIW", "B0007OCG74", "B000JMKKMM", "B00DXLO086", "B00DJYK1XU", "B000B5XOUM", "B000B5IP2O", "B00GOC74Z2", "B001DSNELU", "B00I458456", "B000M343AI", "B00JDCP0QA", "B000R7I3YG", "B0038Q9Q94", "B0016MJ73W", "B000E1MXVO", "B00EC9UI0C", "B0050MB5AC", "B0007V6IWQ", "B00DXLO0D6"], "bought_together": ["B000HIVIOC", "B001993YB8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00I099K4U", "B00GOC75YW", "B001993YB8", "B007JNZYPM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 29025}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 9.24, "brand": "Columbia Tri Star", "asin": "B000EQ45BU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BXVAQY94L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Facts of Life - The Complete First &amp; Second Seasons"}
{"description": "Napola refers to elite military National-Political Schools, set up to train promising young German talents into potential future leaders for the Third Reich - Man makes History, but Napola makes the Man. Set at the peak of Hitler's Nazi regime in 1942, this film explores the very different lives of two youths enrolled in such a school, and exposes some of the difficult training programme that these youths are put through. Friedrich Weimer graduated as a Hitler youth, and spends time juggling work with boxing. Impressing a talent scout with his boxing skills, he gets recruited into one of the Napola schools, to be trained as an athlete to bring the school glory. Coming from a poor home, he sees this as a chance to bring wealth for this family, although they disagree with his joining the Napola. Albrecht Stein is the son of the governor. What he lacked in the brawn department, he makes up with his gift for the written word, which often goes unappreciated, even with his parents. Two youths from different backgrounds bond together as good friends, as they undergo the tough regimental training the school has to offer. At times, it's like Dead Poet's Society in a WWII German military setting, where they challenge and subtly question the establishment and their methods. Even though the school is made up of a recruited pool of the privileged few, basic evils of man persists, like corruption and jealous rivalry.  The different subplots and set action pieces unravel our protagonists' characters, and we see them develop in depth. From a wide-eyed promising talent, we journey with Friedrich as he slowly comes to terms with evaluating if one should sell out one's beliefs for fame and wealth, blinding the disappointment faced in the system. Albrecht, while meek looking, held on to his ideals, especially after a sad episode in the fields, and when being forced into a corner to renounce this ideal, found untold courage to actually do what he did, at the expense of everything else - friendship, family. Which brings us to question, how many of us, if knowing what's right, will do the right thing, or take the easy way out and turn our backs towards the truth? We are also exposed to the highly fanatical training methods of the Nazis, of showing no pity, and signs of cowardice are treasonous. Those who've undergone some form of army training will appreciate the nature of military training - from the physical exercises, punishments, and stand-by-bunks, to the bonding of bunk mates and \"suffering\" under the hands of sadistic superiors. It is no surprise that Napola won various awards for film, acting and direction, It's rich cinematography and haunting soundtrack brings to life Nazi Germany of 1942, and highlighting the horrors of the training of an elitist school of soldiers and future governors, with its expected training tragedies. This is a movie with powerful themes, with an introspective look at the development of man under difficult fanatical regimes revealed in a moving drama.

The quaint mystery bookshop bequeathed to Samantha Kinsey may be struggling, but the idea she's concocted for the weekend should drum up some killer publicity -- a book signing by three very popular and very competitive mystery writers; Maura Hobbs, Angela Cooke, and the reclusive Clare Beckman. Unbeknownst to Sam, Clare is using this \"mystery weekend\" to make the shocking announcement of her retirement. Just as Clare poses for a final career photograph, an ear-shattering gunshot rings out. Clare manages to dodge the bullet, but later falls victim to a cleverly planted poison.  Wading through a long list of suspects and motives, Sam manages to uncover a convoluted plot of blackmail, greed, and deceit -- a real-life mystery that would have thrilled Clare...had she lived to see it unfold.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000ION276", "B000FDEVAC", "B005TTEG5W", "B000NJMJIE", "B00HRUQ8HK", "B006CR2OWM", "B00IYRLUAU", "B007V4QLWE", "B00ALTQRNO", "B00GSTHC7G", "B004HHX9H8", "B00AMU8K8C", "B00HV0TJM2", "B00J49R1BY", "B00DCG3696", "B005HWAOH0", "B002SAMMEC", "B00K2CHUWW", "B00F4CIPRE", "B005ELVCS4", "B00GST8LMG", "B00ESK1PES", "B009INAC12", "B00F9IMX6W", "B00JM5C8WM", "B004Z74X0M", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00E0KWBE4", "B009INAK8C", "0451240901", "B00CD45JCU", "B00465I14M", "B002UNHFVW", "B000LC4ZBC", "B0032LV4NG", "B00JDCP0QA", "B00EI3X9Z8", "B00FOLGW48", "B00EI3XANO", "B002SAMMF6", "B0077PBPTG", "0451415477", "B000NOIX6G", "B005F3XV80", "B003X2P9AS", "B008R5SZZM", "B00KDK64DY", "B003ZJ0POO", "B0000VV5FS", "B000F4RHT8", "B00A4Y60P6", "B008IG0DJQ", "B003H8F5SY", "B0099116S6", "B00HRUQ9BA", "B001PNNCW4", "B00ANV82HE", "B0042FUHWA", "B005YCEIIE", "B00BNAE6M4", "B00A4Y61ZU", "B004WMOSNM", "B00CYQXE10", "B00006HAYQ", "B000KGH00C", "B003RHZ6CK", "B009L0NC82", "B0055SJX4Q", "B00GAJFJTC", "B000GW8UAO", "B00GWXI20E", "0425264475", "0425259676", "B00CD45IYO", "B008U1ANHG", "B005X5XINI", "B000GB5M1K", "B0032LV4KY", "B00A27O5AW", "B000MQCUJ6", "0451419944", "B0000ZMGZW", "B00EJSMOO4", "B0002DRE72", "B008N8A3DA", "B00555ZTBK", "B00EOHGQPI", "B00DNF1RM4", "B00EV1YZD2", "B00G4NV7B8", "B000GB5M1A", "B000R7G9D8", "B00A73ANIY", "B0006Z2LLK", "B00F9IMXBC", "B000TGUUFA", "B00C888LOO", "B00AQ8IUJ4", "B001V7YZAC", "B001S86IZO"], "bought_together": ["B000ION276", "B005TTEG5W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005TTEG5W", "B004HHX9H8", "B007V4QLWE", "B009INAK8C"]}, "price": 6.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 141042}, "asin": "B000EWBO7W", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51xh%2BP7Q4EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mystery Woman: Mystery Weekend"}

{"description": "It is truly wondrous that Criterion selected the obscure sci-fi cult gem,Equinox, to bestow with classic status. Filmed in Bronson Canyon, Los Angeles, three teens used their college funds to make the $6500 film about four kids who stumble upon a Satanic bible with tragic consequences. David (Edward Connell), Susan (Barbara Hewitt), Jim (Frank Bonner), and Vicki (Robin Christopher) see a medieval castle, find an old man living in a cave, enter an alternate universe, and fight several monsters, including the devil, all in the course of an afternoon. In the same demonic spirit asRosemary's Baby, released two years prior,Equinox'soccult thrill factor is amplified by Harryhausen-like special effects courtesy of Dennis Muren (Star Wars,Jurassic Park). Reminiscent ofKing Kongand the sci-fi greats of the 50s, Equinox would be ideally viewed in a drive-in. This Criterion box set contains both the original version, titledThe Equinox, and the superior 1970 remake by Jack Woods, who stars as Asmodeus, a possessed Park Ranger. An introductory film stars Forrest J. Ackerman, discussing his influential magazineFamous Monsters of Filmland.

{"description": "When lonely hearts want to connect, is there any better way, really, than dancing?Marilyn Hotchkiss Ballroom Dancing & Charm Schoolis a sweet indie valentine to dance, and to the connection of lost, broken souls. The stellar cast is led by English Everyguy Robert Carlyle, a widower who believes he's fulfilling a dying man's last wish--to find a long-lost love--by showing up at a Thursday night dance class. Carlyle is by turns awkward, warm, sincere and bewildered, perfectly believable as a man awash in grief yet hoping to rejoin life. It turns out that dance class, led by the theatrical Mary Steenburgen, holds his lifeline. Other strong performances come from Marisa Tomei, Sean Astin, John Goodman, Ernie Hudson, David Paymer, Camryn Manheim and Sonia Braga, all of whom play people yearning for something, some one. Viewers may get distracted early in the film, seeing Carlyle in a dance venue and secretly hoping the soundtrack would queue up \"You Sexy Thing,\" to get to see Carlyle reprise some of his fabulous shtick fromThe Full Monty. But it turns out Carlyle is just as winning performing the Lindy Hop or waltz. And, the film suggests, once the body moves and the soul is stirred--can love be far behind? The answer is: May I have the honor of this dance? Extras include the short 1990 film this feature was based on and an audio commentary.--A.T.

I remember watching this movie on tv, even the specific scenes with the spiders in the burlap coffee bags (and I always look twice at bags of un-ground coffee too) on the plane and the ending. The combination of television stars, action writing, and hairy-legged spiders actually is quite satisfying for me, even as a grown-up.

{"description": "The lives of two stoic cowboys and five abused Chinese women become intertwined in Walter Hill's sprawling miniseriesBroken Trail. Print Ritter (Academy Award winner Robert Duvall) and his nephew Tom Harte (Thomas Haden Church,Sideways) agree to deliver a herd of 500 horses from Oregon to Wyoming. Along the way, they rescue the young women--most of them still just girls--who're being transported to a brothel to have their virginity auctioned off. When the madam sees she is about to lose the girls, she screams at Tom, \"What about my property?\" He shouts back, \"That's the price of being a capitalist, lady.\" Unable to overcome the language barrier, Print assigns numbers to the girls. Number 3, Sun Foy (Gwendoline Yeo,Desperate Housewives) is the most fearless and perceptive of them. Though the others don't want to be called Number 4--an unlucky numeral in their homeland--Ye Fung (Olivia Cheng), the most tragic of the group, doesn't care. Targeted for her beauty, she finds herself unable to overcome the trauma. The number suits her, in her mind. Along the way, Print and Tom rescue Nola Johns (Greta Scacchi), the proverbial hooker with the heat of gold, who was forced into prostitution after her husband died.The cinematography is gorgeous as the camera sweeps over the lush landscape (the Canadian Rockies subbing in for wild West of the late 1800s) and Hill does a formidable job of pacing this 3-hour drama with just the right balance of dialogue and action. For Duvall,Broken Trailis the last piece to his Western trilogy, which started with the miniseriesLonesome Dovefollowed by the feature filmOpen Range. He is instantly likeable as a father figure and the viewer never doubts that his intention for the girls is honorable. As for Haden Church, he has never been as appealing as he is in this role. Gruff and flawed, he softens when he exchanges shy glances with Sun Foy. The trek is long and hard and the unlikely band of travelers will face much hardship. If not as satisfying as the rich, detailedLonesome Dove,Broken Trailmakes up for it with a wonderful storyline and some fine acting by all involved. As for the conclusion, it may surprise some viewers who are expecting a more traditional version of the happy ending.--Jae-Ha Kim", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000TANUI", "B0018PH3L0", "B00116GEJS", "B0038EGD3I", "B00368PSKK", "B00368PSKU", "B00DZUV0M4", "B002LII6PU", "6305504024", "B000059H7K", "B0035JHYJI", "B001VC99HQ", "B000E5N6LG", "B000BITVBA", "B001KO1BCQ", "6304711905", "B00007G78A", "B003NF97MQ", "B001LRJH0U", "B001LMAK88", "B000EOTUSK", "B0007OY2OO", "B00005LOL0", "B003Q7B6ZC", "B003AWRMCE", "B0007OY2NA", "B004AOECXI", "B00IO03I6Q", "B000XR9L50", "B0000YTP02", "B000W1SZBS", "B00AEBBA0E", "1555916058", "B003ASLJRC", "B0081FSMPG", "B000BT96DW", "B00AEFYPHA", "B0037HERB6", "B005OZVXCU", "B0007OY2OE", "B001NVV7G6", "B0007MAO0C", "B00A92MF6Q", "B001B187MU", "B00E3QJ8DC", "B000056H2H", "B000O599WQ", "B00006FDA4", "B003ASLJS6", "B000N3SSBW", "B004KDYQYY", "B009INAI02", "0767817672", "B003UESJME", "B007PXYWNQ", "B000O599Y4", "B0002J4X2K", "B000NOIVT0", "B001AR0D54", "0767817710", "B005J47QEA", "B00AEBB932", "B000056H2J", "B00008CMR4", "B005DEUER2", "B000OT6V0U", "B00007ELF1", "B001B187NO", "B000059TFW", "B000O599YE", "B00EU8RBXW", "B000H5U69I", "B0008ENHUS", "B005NGKMOU", "B00008CMT3", "B00BAXTY7G", "B00AEFYSEA", "B004HHX9T6", "B0042RJWTM", "B001R0AY9Y", "B00AMDA2OY", "B00004WG2F", "B00AFEY7RI", "B003ZFO4XQ", "B00AEBB8YM", "B000F9T70K", "B000QRI1GW", "B0010DR4BO", "B0012CJQXW", "B002NALPBS", "B0045HCJSK", "B000O599ZS", "0783225725", "B00006672R", "B00CEAXE1G", "B0000C2IR4", "B000059TFU", "B003L20IG0", "B000P0J0EM"], "bought_together": ["B0000TANUI", "B0018PH3L0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00116GEJS", "B0018PH3L0", "B0000TANUI", "B0038EGD3I"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6820}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 11.0, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000GFRI4K", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N5DFW0YJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Broken Trail"}
{"description": "Forget any off-screen impressions you may have of Mel Gibson, and experience Apocalypto as the mad, bloody runaway train that it is. The story is set in the pre-Columbian Maya population: one village is brutally overrun, its residents either slaughtered or abducted, by a ruling tribe that needs slaves and human sacrifices. We focus on the capable warrior Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), although Gibson skillfully sketches a whole population of characters--many of whom don't survive the early reels. Most of the film is set in the dense jungle, but the middle section, in a grand Mayan city, is a dazzling triumph of design, costuming, and sheer decadent terror. The movie itself is a triumph of brutality, as Gibson lets loose his well-established fascination with bodily mortification in a litany of assaults including impalement, evisceration, snakebite, and bee stings. It's a dark, disgusted vision, but Gibson doesn't forget to apply some very canny moviemaking instincts to the violence--including the creation of a tremendous pair of villains (strikingly played by Raoul Trujillo and Rodolfo Palacias). The film is in a Maya dialect, subtitled in English, and shot on digital video (which occasionally betrays itself in some blurry quick pans). Amidst all the mayhem, nothing in the film is more devastating than a final wordless exchange of looks between captured villager Blunted (Jonathan Brewer) and his wife's mother (Maria Isabel Diaz), a superb change in tone from their early relationship. Yes, this is an obsessive, crazed movie, but Gibson knows what he's doing. --Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000UVV24M", "B0012Q732O", "B00003CXAF", "B001BNFRB2", "B000VMIILU", "1573623903", "B002O3Z50Q", "B00004XPPG", "6305692688", "B00028HBKM", "B00004RJ71", "B00AEFXKUI", "B002ZG999U", "B0002YLCG0", "B000VKL6ZM", "B002T9H2LA", "B0000542C6", "B0001CNQX0", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00006ADD5", "B00406UK7S", "B004AOECXI", "B004SIP8W0", "B000R9U3B0", "B00008G8LY", "B00001ZWUS", "B000MGB6NM", "B003EYVXXW", "6304711905", "B004HO6HWA", "B000QXDED6", "B0034G4P58", "B0000714BS", "B000XR9L50", "B00005JLQT", "0783230389", "B002VWNIEA", "B00AZNEW5G", "B008MIMWQW", "B003VA3JZY", "B0002DRDIW", "B000AARKOO", "B00BEJL6JK", "B004SIP7TE", "079283366X", "B00005V9HH", "B000M341QE", "B003HKN52U", "B005IUIXCE", "B00275EGWY", "B003UYUQZW", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002O3Z510", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B002WY65VU", "B000I0RNWU", "B00003CXWV", "B002XMGGK6", "B003NF97NK", "B000QXDCJ2", "B001FB5634", "B001DZOC6Y", "B007STBUHI", "B0000VCZMK", "B0013FDM7E", "B00015YVDG", "B003IY498Y", "6305433925", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005K3NR", "B000O76ZQC", "B003ELKNH2", "B00018D3ZA", "6304821832", "B00AEBBA36", "B009YQJ322", "B00005JL3T", "079284646X", "B002CA68MU", "B00BTYJYR6", "B00AEFYE08", "B000P0J09C", "B005LAIHPE", "B00441GZ1Y", "B001OQCV2E", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000BITV9W", "B004LWZW4M", "B005LAIIRQ", "B00003CXBH", "B000A2WP7O", "B001GCUO0W", "B00005JPD0", "B00AMSLDTM", "B000RTB0R6", "B00005JA8B", "B00009PY4G", "0783226039", "B000B8QG22", "B000069I1I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001BNFRB2", "B00028HBKM", "B00001ZWUS", "B00004XPPG"]}, "price": 10.55, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 53938}, "asin": "B000GNOKQG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41yXQu76-NL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Apocalypto (2006) (2007) Rudy Youngblood; Raoul Trujillo; Mel Gibson"}

{"description": "Long beforeAnimal Planetexisted, Walt Disney'sTrue-Life Adventuresawakened viewers to the wonders of the natural world.  Disney began the series in 1946 withSeal Island, and the six features and seven featurettes won eight Academy Awards.Listen to our interviewwith director emeritusRoy E. Disney.One winner wasBear Country(1953), which is included inCreatures of the Wild, along withThe African Lion(1955),Jungle Cat(1959) andThe Olympic Elk(1952). Each film traces the course of one year in the life of its subject. Lionesses hunt to feed their cubs (and their glorious but idle mates) on Serengeti Plains. A pair of jaguars in the Amazon and a mother bear in Yellowstone Park raise their cubs, teaching them to find food and avoid predators. Magnificent bull elk fight for mates in the high meadows of the Olympic Mountains.  Except for the narration occasionally seeming a little forced or obvious, these documentaries wear their age lightly. The prints have been lovingly restored: scratches and dirt have been removed; the color looks pristine. Artists and scientists will find useful reference material here, and children will enjoy the pageant of nature. Sadly, many of the ecological communities that seemed as inexhaustible as they were beautiful in the 1950's have been severely damaged during the intervening decades by human encroachment, poaching, and climate change. The two-disc set is loaded with extras, including two black-and-whiteDisneylandshows from the 1950's.

{"description": "Here's one of Hollywood's great excursions into surrealism:The Gang's All Here, the legendarily over-the-top wartime musical. Director Busby Berkeley threw every demented idea that every swirled out of his teeming brain into this madcap affair, and decades later the film was still wowing 'em as a campy jaw-dropper.The plot is the nonsensical stuff of homefront musicals, with chorus girl Alice Faye waiting for soldier boy James Ellison to return from the war, little knowing he is engaged to another woman. But the real point here is the crazy production design and the flabbergasting numbers--most famously, Carmen Miranda's \"The Lady in the Tutti-Frutti Hat,\" which includes a chorus line of women dancing while holding giant bananas over their heads. It might have been dreamed up by Salvador Dali after an acid trip. Alice gets her due with the equally crazy \"Polka-Dot Polka,\" and Benny Goodman and his orchestra are also around. So are such reliable second bananas (you should excuse the expression) as Edward Everett Horton and high-kicking Charlotte Greenwood.The DVD extras include a 20-minute documentary on Berkeley's peculiar art, plus a charming 25-promotional film featuring Alice Faye reminiscing about her old pictures and extolling the virtues of physical fitness (made for the Pfizer drug company while Faye was their spokesperson). A deleted comedy scene and two episodes from the long-running radio show Faye did with husband Phil Harris are also included. The print itself is a source of controversy; the colors lack the \"pop\" of the original Technicolor, and the film looks dimmer and vaguer than its original glory. Here's hoping a cleaner, fuller version will emerge.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000K7VHNM", "B000BZISUI", "B000EXDSA2", "B00K8CQ1Q2", "B0019APR62", "B000EXDSAC", "B0002B15RE", "B0019APR6W", "B00KIZY3XW", "B000EXDS7A", "B0019APR5S", "B00008DDRU", "B00KGLS050", "B00158K1B4", "B0009NZ2NS", "B0019APR6M", "B000AP04LK", "B000K7VHNC", "B00158K1AK", "B000BZISU8", "B000PC8AL4", "B000GETTIO", "B00DZFKN54", "B0007939MK", "B0002XNT08", "B00199PPUG", "B004KZH5F4", "B000KJTBZG", "B004132I6Q", "B00158K1AU", "B00012FXJ0", "B00DVPMYWI", "B0001DCYUK", "B00007GZQF", "B00143XE1E", "B0047BXR1C", "B0011FDVD6", "B000W089XS", "B000EXDS9S", "B00GXKZQIM", "B000EBD9S0", "B00AQ6J64O", "B00I04SVV8", "B00I39V9H8", "B00B27WTBI", "B006TTC5A4", "B000PAAK5A", "B000UZDO3A", "B00143XE28", "B0008ENICU", "B000244EZ6", "B00143XDYC", "B000E0OE1M", "B0002B15Y2", "B00023P4OC", "B0062Z0PLQ", "B000BQ7JVG", "B000EBD9SK", "B0001LJCRA", "B000KGGJ1I", "B000KJTGFG", "B00C3ALM02", "B00BGGIXZQ", "B00457ZNS8", "B00GTSVPHY", "B000087F79", "B000EBD9SA", "B00GTSVM8Q", "B0001FR55C", "B001D8W7F4", "B00005LDCR", "B00A2536DG", "B00CA4S308", "B00006RCO1", "B000DZD9SM", "B00005A06N", "B00005JKS8", "B0008ENICA", "B0001FGBZW", "B001BPB5Y8", "B000H1RFSM", "B000059GEI", "B00CVB6XF2", "B002EWD0DG", "B00158K1A0", "B004KZH5KY", "B00CS711FQ", "B00GST8H70", "B00BY8DAAE", "B00466JALY", "B009X919UE", "B00178T3Q6", "B000BOH922", "B0019APR6C", "B000EU1Q1S", "B000EXDSBQ", "B0007ZEOQE", "B00IELX388", "B0024FAG8A", "B000E0ODZY"], "bought_together": ["B000K7VHNM", "B000EXDSA2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000K7VHNM", "B00158K14G", "B000EXDSA2", "B000BZISUI"]}, "price": 19.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 252085}, "asin": "B000K7VHN2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SIqxloAVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Gang's All Here"}

{"description": "Much was written about Will Ferrell's first \"dramatic role\" as Harold Crick, an IRS auditor who begins hearing a voice narrating his life. ButStranger Than Fictionis hardly a drama. However, what Ferrell does--like Jim Carrey before him inThe Truman Show--is handle a toned-down character with genuineness and affection: you believe he is this guy. Crick leads a lonely life filled with numbers and routines. While at first he considers the voice a nuisance, Crick decides more action is needed when it speaks of \"his demise.\" Enter Professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), who takes on the absurd notion with revelry, trying to find out what kind of book Crick's life is leading. It turns out that the voice Crick is hearing belongs to Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson), a very real--and troubled--author who is writing a book in which Crick is a fictional character. As usual with these things, the stuffed shirt learns to live a better life--Crick even falls for one of his audits, a brash baker named Ana (Maggie Gyllenhaal). Marc Foster (Monster's Ball, Finding Neverland) has the right tone for the film, using great urban scenes (the unnamed city is Chicago) with interesting visualizations of Crick's world of numbers. He also directs Ferrell, Hoffman, and Gyllenhaal to their most charming performances (plus Linda Hunt and Tom Hulce pop up in two funny scenes). Ferrell succeeds in being a romantic lead you can root for; a scene where he eats Ana's freshly baked cookies is totally delightful without a hint of sarcasm. Screenwriter Zach Helm has two personal traits with his story: like Crick he followed his heart (he stopped rewriting scripts and only worked on his own) and like Eiffel, the final results are not a masterpiece, but good, and entertaining enough.

{"description": "A feel-good movie that highlights the beauty of France as much as it does its stars,A Good Yearprovides a languid, gorgeous viewing experience. Director Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe--who first worked together on the Academy Award-winningGladiator--are reunited in this romantic film, which is based on Peter Mayle's bookA Year in Provence. Crowe plays Max, a workaholic London bonds trader who doesn't know the meaning of vacation. When his uncle dies, leaving him a picturesque estate in the south of France, Max views it as an opportunity to cash in the vinery and pocket the profits. The film is reminiscent of Diane Lane'sUnder the Tuscan Sunin the way the scenery plays as much of a role in the film as its characters. The lush village and streaming sunlight portray Provence as an idyllic, magical place. Even Max falls under its spell. While not a particularly likeable character, especially in the early part of the film, Max also isn't a bad guy. When he gets the chance to live life at a less manic pace than which he is used to, he finds that a good year isn't dependant on a financial windfall. Though Scott tries to drum up some suspense in the film (Is the beautiful visitor really Max's illegitimate cousin? Will Max fall in love with the feisty local woman he trades quips with?) nothing that happens comes as much of a surprise. Still, while the film doesn't fully utilize Crowe's range of skills, the actor is charming in his role andA Good Yearprovides a fine time in the cinemas. --Jae-Ha KimExtras fromA Good YearRussell Crowe and Co-Stars on Filming in ProvenceA Good YearVirtual VinyardBeyondA Good YearA Year in ProvenceMore from Director Ridley ScottMore from Russell CroweStills fromA Good Year", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001LPWGBY", "B0007TKOAA", "B0000VD02Y", "B000JBWWBK", "B000C8STWQ", "B00D7HBV10", "B00EZC8042", "B004SIP6BI", "B00006ZXSI", "B00008G7UF", "B0000CE684", "B00005BCKF", "B00BVMXCRY", "0375705627", "B007JNR54A", "B002DU39GW", "B00F878KE8", "B003B3V0W0", "B002ZG988M", "B00AEBB8YW", "B003U0AHBO", "0679731148", "B0001HLVS2", "B0009OL7Z4", "B004SIP7D0", "B0042816YK", "B00003CWRX", "B00005JPSM", "B00006ZXSO", "B001N44BVQ", "B00004Y7Y4", "B00005NKCN", "B000F3UAFC", "0394572300", "0743297326", "B00006ADD5", "B000023VTP", "B000ARTN3I", "B000085OXZ", "B001CIOCLC", "630560097X", "B00008G7UL", "B000MQC9H4", "B006DHAT5K", "B003PIUIJC", "B003L20IG0", "0375405917", "B00003CWUX", "B000YAA68C", "B00005JMIJ", "B006TTC540", "B000OPOAJS", "B00005JKKY", "B001DB6J6Y", "B00012QLB4", "B001THZAAI", "B005MYEQ4U", "B0006A9FIM", "B000BNX3B4", "B000085OY1", "B008H1Q3QY", "B00AZMFO6I", "B005MYEPXC", "B00C888MJ8", "B002ZG989G", "B00CIOD6HK", "B00000JGHK", "B00AEBB8SS", "B0001DCYUU", "B00003CXXG", "B005S9EJ14", "B00AEFXIIW", "B002U4UYZA", "6305692696", "0783230079", "B000EMGJ7C", "B00005JPX8", "B002ZG988W", "B009SH5JS4", "B000HEWEE4", "B00AEFYK5M", "B00005TNEQ", "B001C5LLQ4", "B002K0WBXW", "B00006ZXSN", "6305428034", "B001ECDVK4", "B004SIP8JI", "B0000AOV4I", "B000XR9L50", "B000XT1P3E", "B0038N9X3Q", "B002ZG97B0", "B004L3AR0K", "B00DL48BM6", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B000067FP2", "B000CCW2P2", "B005HWAOP2", "B008N8A3JE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003B3V0W0", "B001LPWGBY", "B00006ZXSI", "B0000VD02Y"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 85244}, "asin": "B000LXHK22", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DLfytc0cL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Good Year (Full-Screen Edition)"}
{"description": "Martin Scorsese makes a welcome return to the mean streets (of Boston, in this case) withThe Departed, hailed by many as Scorsese's best film sinceCasino. Since this crackling crime thriller is essentially a Scorsese-stamped remake of the acclaimed 2002 Hong Kong thrillerInfernal Affairs, the film was intensely scrutinized by devoted critics and cinephiles, and while Scorsese's intense filmmaking and all-star cast deserve ample acclaim,The Departedis also worthy of serious re-assessment, especially with regard to what some attentive viewers described as sloppy craftsmanship (!), notably in terms of mismatched shots and jagged continuity. But no matter where you fall on the Scorsese appreciation scale, there's no denying thatThe Departedis a signature piece of work from one of America's finest directors, designed for maximum impact with a breathtaking series of twists, turns, and violent surprises. It's an intricate cat-and-mouse game, but this time the cat and mouse are both moles: Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is an ambitious cop on the rise, planted in the Boston police force by criminal kingpin Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a hot-tempered police cadet who's been artificially disgraced and then planted into Costello's crime operation as a seemingly trustworthy soldier. As the multilayered plot unfolds (courtesy of a scorching adaptation byKingdom of Heavenscreenwriter William Monahan), Costigan and Sullivan conduct a volatile search for each other (they're essentially looking for \"themselves\") while simultaneously wooing the psychiatrist (Vera Farmiga) assigned to treat their crime-driven anxieties.Such convenient coincidences might sink a lesser film, butThe Departedis so electrifying that you barely notice the plot-holes. And while Nicholson's profane swagger is too much \"Jack\" and not enough \"Costello,\" he's still a joy to watch, especially in a film that's additionally energized by memorable (and frequently hilarious) supporting roles for Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg, and a host of other big-name performers.The Departedalso makes clever and plot-dependent use of cell-phones, to the extent that it couldn't exist without them. Powered by Scorsese's trademark use of well-chosen soundtrack songs (from vintage rock to Puccini's operas),The Departedmay not be perfect, but it's one helluva ride for moviegoers, proving popular enough to become the biggest box-office hit of Scorsese's commercially rocky career.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002ZG99N6", "B000P0J09M", "B004SIP7TE", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002ZG980U", "B002VWNIEA", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEBB8NI", "B002T9H2LA", "B00005JLSB", "B000MZHW40", "B00080ZG10", "B003ASLJQS", "B000P0J0AG", "B000P0J0EW", "B000C20VPA", "B003UESJHO", "B004SIP7ZS", "B003ASLJO0", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AHTYI5M", "B00275EGWY", "B000XR9L50", "B000A3XY5A", "B0007DFJ0G", "B001N44BVQ", "B00003CXWV", "B008MILL8W", "B000286RP2", "B004SIP7VM", "B00005V9HH", "6305313687", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004FQX5B6", "B00AEFXKUI", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEBB86A", "B005LAIIJY", "B0016Q2D66", "B003ASLJQI", "B00008975Z", "B000IY04Q8", "B001P9KR8U", "B00005JNJV", "B000C20VRS", "B008R65XYC", "B005LAIGRS", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00008DP4C", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00005JN0W", "B005LAIGLE", "B000A2UBN4", "B002QEHPQU", "B000P0J0EM", "B003UESJH4", "B007D5E7C2", "6304765258", "B000P0J0D8", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00004WG2F", "0767830555", "B000LC55F2", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B004EPYZP8", "B000A7DVR2", "B00005JPD0", "B000WZEZGI", "B00049QQHI", "B000FS9FCG", "B00004XPPB", "B006OFN0SE", "B009AMAL4Y", "B004U7MR14", "B000GFLKF8", "B003AWRMCE", "B0019L770A", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B0000AM6JI", "B004SIP9Z6", "B001GZ6QC4", "0783240295", "B0010DR4BO", "B000065U1N", "B00001ZWUS", "B00BB67UNW", "B0000B1OFL", "B00AEBB9K0", "B00DHDDE32", "B00005JKWX", "B0051MKNV8", "B002ZG97RE", "0767802519", "B0034G4P94", "B00DHHWXYY", "B00005B6JZ", "B00003CXZ4", "B001TODCII"], "bought_together": ["B000P0J09M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000RETOHY", "B000P0J09M", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEBB8NI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5067}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.5, "brand": "Warner Bros", "asin": "B000M341QE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RZnzpL34L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "After the release of a six-episode Television Favorites sampler,The Drew Carey Showhas earned a well-deserved promotion, DVD-wise, with this complete first-season set. Few television workplace comedies so keenly or hilariously captured the mind-numbing drudgery and soul-crushing despair of cubicle culture asThe Drew Carey Show, a kindred spirit to the \"Dilbert\" comic strip. The pilot episode introduces the bespectacled, buzz-coiffed Everyman, a \"go-getter\" in his seventh year as the assistant director of personnel in a Cleveland department store, a position, he notes, \"of indirect respect and oblique power.\" The giddy delights ofThe Drew Carey Showare many, from the smile-inducing theme song, \"Moon Over Parma\" (\"We're going bowlin' / So don't lose her in Solin\") to one of TV's most likeable ensembles: Ryan Stiles as goofy Lewis (or, as Jason Alexander joked on Comedy Central's Drew Carey roast, \"Kramer-lite\"), Diedrich Bader as Oswald (less of a doofus here than in later seasons), Christa Miller as tomboyish Kate, Drew's lifelong platonic friend and unrequited crush, Kathy Kinney as Mimi, Drew's office nemesis, who is Bluto to his Popeye. The appealing Katy Selverstone is also featured as Lisa, with whom Drew has a secret inter-office romance that will last but this one season.After the enormously telegenicFriendscast, Drew and company are \"a cold little splash of reality,\" portraying relatable, regular people. In this first season, the series is still finding its feet (enjoy them while you can: Drew's hillbilly neighbors, and the voice of Kevin Pollack as Drew's abusive boss, Mr. Bell). But by season's end, as guest star Jamie Lee Curtis (as Drew's hard-partying barber) polkas with Mimi in the hilarious episode \"Playing the Unified Field,\" the series has established its spontaneous, off-center niche. While there are no episode commentaries, this set puts in some valuable overtime with \"Life Inside a Cubicle,\" a retrospective in which cast and series creators reflect on the series' rocky beginnings.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000CSRSGY", "B001U3ZYX4", "B000GRUQJC", "B000T28PXI", "B001MVYUSO", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B00BM2JVAA", "B000RGULLA", "B00GOC74I4", "B00005JLIB", "B0058EE6NK", "B004F4HWQM", "B003NHMYI8", "B000T28PZQ", "B0006N2EZK", "B0000ZMH8S", "B0001Z3I0S", "B0002NY81M", "B001D2WUDE", "B00GOC74QG", "B004MWLXTY", "B00K8HAKSW", "B00K8HALVI", "B001DZOCVO", "B00GHH9HW2", "B0058EE6O4", "B005DCJ0Q0", "B001O4KBO6", "B004WO9OMA", "B0006N2EZA", "B007C8RZXS", "B000A7Q1YC", "B0012EM5DS", "B0002W4SWW", "B00005JNIS", "B00005JM3A", "B000TGURZ8", "B00HNGC56G", "B0025KVNOU", "B002AMVEEM", "B001DSNEM4", "B000MTEFVE", "B000YKYT1M", "B000Y7U9AK", "B005ZVIMUE", "B000FBH3WW", "B008L0YMWS", "B005D0OHA6", "B001TKJDNA", "B000CCBCCG", "B00A2XQTF0", "B000FI8MPC", "B00369ERC4", "B002KQ6UE2", "B00FM4S7P4", "B000SQFC0O", "B0007US79Y", "B001P9N9B2", "B000QFCDAO", "B000DZ854A", "B000EU1QC2", "B001NPK5BU", "B000BX0VU0", "B000NJMJHA", "B0001Z3I1C", "B000FTC1GW", "B00008J2EB", "B0000DFZ5O", "B002ACKBTG", "B005MQ58OU", "B000EYK4H6", "B00005JOXR", "B00BXTH474", "B000LE16VM", "B001HUHBD6", "B0000AGQ25", "B00A2XQU7M", "B0025KVTLW", "B001OQCVCE", "B00151QYT4", "B000KLQUMG", "B002JYPVR2", "B002OOWL3Y", "B007C8RZL0", "B00BUWD7Y8", "B001LRL4WY", "B00IFK7ONI", "B000EXDRZI", "B00BUWD7E8", "B009X919YU", "B0002NY81C", "B000F8O2MO", "B004M3M5F4", "B000AJJNIQ", "B0002NY8R6", "B005CGI4EG", "B0008ENHU8", "B00IFK7OFG", "B000VJE1NW", "B000NOKJD6"], "bought_together": ["B001U3ZYX4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001U3ZYX4", "B00GOC74I4", "B001MVYUSO", "B000T28PZQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 29154}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 11.0, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000MGBLFK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51e3jJd67YL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Drew Carey Show: Season 1"}
{"description": "Since their losses to Green Bay in the 1966 and '67 NFL Championship games, the Dallas Cowboys had become known as a team incapable of winning the big one. But in 1971, Dallas finally shed its  runner-up role by defeating the Miami Dolphins 24-3 in Super Bowl VI. In 1977, the Cowboys obtained the draft rights to Heisman Trophy winner Tony Dorsett and landed the final piece to their championship puzzle. Dorsett won Rookie of the Year honors and Dallas surged to a 14 and 2 record before cruising to victory over the Broncos in Super Bowl XII. Dallas was absent from the Super Bowl for 15 years before winning three Championships in four seasons. In 1992, the \"triplets\", quarterback Troy Aikman, running back Emmitt  Smith and wide receiver Michael Irvin, powered the Cowboys to a 52-17 victory over the Bills in Super Bowl XXVII.&#160;The next season saw the \"triplets\" and eight of their teammates reach the Pro Bowl as this talent-laden team won its second straight Super Bowl, defeating the Bills again in Super Bowl XXVIII. Dallas failed to three-peat in 1994, but came back in 1995 under Head Coach Barry Switzer to win their third championship in four years with a 27-17 victory over the Steelers. With their victory in Super Bowl XXX, the  Dallas Cowboys joined the San Francisco 49ers as five-time winners of the Super Bowl.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003L7DK9W", "B000AYEL5Q", "B0000C8AO2", "B000RW3YZ4", "B001A5ES8Y", "B001D7T45G", "B000ROA00Y", "B000RW3Z0S", "B000RW3Z0I", "B000RW3YZO", "B000RW3Z1C", "B000ROA01I", "B00DBPBQ0E", "B000RW3Z08", "B00127OVPU", "B003NF97JO", "B00127SO4E", "B0089BSNCO", "B000ROA018", "B0049985Q4", "B001CR8YAI", "B00AC6HBPO", "B001F2B1PU", "B001CR9510", "B00DBPBP8C", "B001CW800M", "B005N4DPSC", "B005N4DQ8Q", "B001BS2VJ8", "B001CR7828", "B000S2XD8G", "B0009NSCSU", "0871403331", "B000PY52DQ", "B00127QL12", "B001CW800C", "B000KF0DEI", "B000GYI34K", "B0026OE2OS", "B000X3UIYW", "B003M8NGPS", "B00CS7PKGM", "B001CR96GE", "B000PY52E0", "B001BGS176", "B0009NSCSK", "1603201149", "B0002DRDIC", "B001BSBC0M", "B001BS1BI0", "B0013LCOCM", "B0000C8AO3", "B003L7DKA6", "B00287Z1DO", "0760340390", "B006JN86XU", "1605539023", "B00186DF5C", "B000GYI34A", "B0002V7TZG", "B0012IX3CQ", "B002AS461O", "B001GVJB98", "B001UNSZWG", "0760335206", "B001GP5TOK", "B003DC8838", "B00GYVPINI", "B002VXEBYA", "B0000AVHA5", "B000WMA75O", "B0002ABURA", "B002BIULOO", "0399132643", "B00EAOJS3M", "1613213964", "B0009S87YE", "B001RAYN1E", "B005J5K9UW", "B001KVZ6ES"], "bought_together": ["B003L7DK9W", "B000AYEL5Q"], "also_viewed": ["B000AYEL5Q", "B001D7T45G", "B0000C8AO2", "B003L7DK9W", "B001A5ES8Y", "B000RW3YZ4", "1603201149", "B000RW3Z0S", "B000ROA00Y", "B000VAHQW4", "B000RW3Z0I", "B004130ZKW", "B0012IX3CQ", "B000ROA018", "B008WAM36E", "B000RW3Z1C", "B000RW3YZO", "B001CR7828", "B0089BSNCO", "B000RW3Z08", "B002MLQ89M", "B002BIULOO", "B00127QL12", "B00406UJW4", "B000BCYXBY", "B00DBPBP8C", "B00DBPBQ0E", "B004USUOYU", "B000AYEL56", "B001CR8YAI", "B002MLKEPQ", "B00AC6HBPO", "B001CW800C", "B001CW800M", "B00DBPBQ4K", "B00127OVPU", "B0029ZUQ8A", "B000KF0DEI", "B0002DRDIC", "B001CR9510", "B000S2XD8G", "B000H6SXNI", "0760335206", "B002I47EJ6", "B001BSBC0W", "B000AYEL60", "B001CR96GE", "B00G9B6CQ0", "B00JPS7HOA"]}, "price": 19.28, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "brand": "Team Marketing", "asin": "B000RPD0IM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51vvHxJ5oqL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cowboys Team Marketing NFL Game: Cowboys"}
