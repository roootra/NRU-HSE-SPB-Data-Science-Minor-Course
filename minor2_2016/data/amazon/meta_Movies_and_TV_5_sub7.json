{"description": "Grab an econo-pack of tissues, gather your loved ones around a cozy  television, and bring on the hot cocoa--it's time for a dose of Christmas  spirit. The tender and charming Mary Steenburgen (Parenthood) dons a sour disposition in her role as Ginny Grainger, a woman who finds little joy in life  lately--let alone in the impending holiday season. Money is tight, her  husband (beautifully downplayed by nice-guy Gary Basaraba) lost his job,  and the family must move out of their house. Ginny cannot even bring  herself to say, \"Merry Christmas,\" despite her family's enthusiasm about  the big day. With help from Ginny's brave and loving daughter (sweetly  performed by Elisabeth Harnois) and a Christmas angel named Gideon (Harry Dean  Stanton), Ginny undergoes a life-altering experience &agrave; laIt's a Wonderful Life. The result? Happy endings, hugs and  kisses, pass the tissues.Not a light holiday entertainer by any means, the plot verges on  depressing at times, as the family struggles through money issues and the  tedium of daily suburban survival. While handled fairly subtly, some of  the bridging story--including a shooting, a kidnapping, and a  drowning--might prove disturbing to children under 6 years old. And  really: if the somber Harry Dean Stanton (Paris, Texas) repeatedly  appeared in your neighborhood, cloaked in a cowboy hat and overcoat,  would you allow your kids outside? Still, a well-made favorite to  cherish.--Liane Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301752627"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 392357}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.77, "brand": "", "asin": "0764007211", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CE6WPRT4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "One Magic Christmas [VHS]"}

{"description": "Having based so much of his career on the films from the region, Jean Claude Van Damme heads to Hong Kong itself forKnock Off. Set in the 72 hours running up to the British handover to China (and released a mere year after the actual event), the film's action centers around the colony's thriving bootleg business, tied in with a rather convoluted plot concerning the CIA, Russian Mafia, and an attempt to hold the United States ransom through covert attacks. The opening section unwisely tries Van Damme's hand at knockabout humor with partner Rob Schneider but merely proves that the star is severely lacking the sort of humorous touch that Arnold Schwarzenegger has so successfully utilized. OnceKnock Offdescends into more familiar Van Damme territory, the film--and its leading man--are on surer ground. There are a good deal of spectacular fight sequences, some amazing stunts, and a feisty female sparring partner in the form of Lela Rochen. Even the always-reliable Paul Sorvino pops up. Director Tsui Hark hits upon some interesting and initially invigorating visual effects but soon overdoes them, actually highlighting the lack of decent story rather than enhancing it. There is an incredible film to be made about this period in history but this isn't it.Knock Offis merely another undemanding, high-kicking, high-octane vehicle for Van Damme.--Phil Udell", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767804252", "076780970X", "6305551235", "6305259429", "B00596WEVI", "B00441GYY2", "B0087OULG4", "B001M9ELQC", "B0000542CD", "B00005N5QW", "B0006JGIQU", "B0099KJFJ4", "B000GDH9IW", "B00005V4XK", "B0011VIO46", "B000N3T0E6", "0783228465", "B001L2ZSJO", "B0000542CC", "B00069L0Y0", "B000022TSJ", "0783226748", "B002TVQ4CG", "B0002S94CK", "B002U6CJCO", "0783227892", "B000ENUYH2", "0792835735", "B008R9GVHM", "B00HODLW6C", "B00CU9QHJM", "B0041QSZLA", "0783114885", "B0021FP3EA", "0783219660", "B000A5043S", "B000255LCK", "B000RW3VCK", "B000QXDCLU", "B0090EDEM8", "B001BS5HX0", "B0000DJZ9Q", "B0002848WQ", "0783225520", "B00E5SAJ5Y", "B001MLZNKS", "B0030E5PWQ", "B008NP4ZUU", "B001EL6ECC", "6305428158", "B003Z94WBG", "B001FWRYYC", "B001T21R5U", "B00004XMV4", "6304779631", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B004MLEYUU", "B001PWY4NG", "B003ZJWXCQ", "B000F6IOCA", "B001AR010Q", "B000E6ESD0", "B00005QJHN", "B00A34LX9A", "6305767866", "B00JVQ7RCS", "B00HVFA2VE", "B00AKGG828", "B0091C22AY", "B00006RCOC", "B000N4SHNK", "B004ZKKKX8", "B000HT38HQ", "B00CU9QHXS", "B002LMV7R0", "B001VFM0YC", "B00007JZUP", "B00009ZPTZ", "B0000ALPFJ", "6305090564", "B002G1WPIG", "B000K7UC2Y", "B0011VIO4Q", "B002AT8KA6", "B0027VTMA4", "B003R3JNTQ", "0790740826", "B0045HCIWW", "B00005JN0T", "B000KX0HIW", "B000006PAB", "6305181721", "0780619331", "B00BUWD7HU", "B002GHHHME", "B002GOAH1A", "B00IQAUO2A", "B00005O06W", "B000053UIF", "B00HW3LAF2"], "bought_together": ["0767804252", "076780970X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0767804252", "0783226748", "B008XAT1HM", "B00E5SAJ5Y"]}, "price": 7.05, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 163166}, "asin": "0767821548", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZGQ6DFC4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Knock Off"}

{"description": "Once upon a time, in the 1980s and early 1990s, American independent movies did not seek to merely ape Hollywood formulas. They were more than just feature-length resumes for shrewd, enterprising filmmakers who had nothing to say, but dreamed of saying it with a big-studio budget. Back then, independent films provided a different kind of movie experience; they challenged and provoked audiences--and none more so than 1991'sThe Rapture, written and directed by Michael Tolkin, the man who wrote the screenplay forThe Player, Robert Altman's scathing anti-Hollywood comedy. Mimi Rogers plays Sharon, a lost soul who gives up her hedonistic life of sex and drugs when she finds God and becomes a fundamentalist Christian fanatic. Her pilgrim's progress, presented in a deadpan, nonjudgmental style, culminates quite literally in the title event--the Second Coming, the Apocalypse, the end of the world, or whatever you want to call it. Rogers's fearless performance becomes all the more provocative when you recall that the actress is a lifelong member of the Church of Scientology.The Raptureis a mind-boggling, wildly ambitious movie that's open to myriad interpretations. But no matter what you make of it, it's sure to leave you engaged and shaken.--Jim Emerson", "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 493451}, "asin": "078060718X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5186BJ8A12L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rapture [VHS]"}

{"description": "This 1986 fantasy/action thriller has since spawned two sequels, a popular syndicated TV series, numerous comic-book spinoffs, and a loyal (if somewhat oddly obsessive) following of fans. Directed by music video veteran Russell Mulcahy (which explains the dizzying camera work), the original theatrical release made hash of an intriguing story about an &quot;Immortal&quot; from 16th-century Scotland (Christopher Lambert) who time-leaps to modern-day America with his archenemy (Clancy Brown) in hot pursuit. It becomes a battle to the death (yes, Immortals can die), and Lambert seeks survival training from an Immortal mentor played by Sean Connery. Dazzling, energetic, and altogether confusing in its original form, the film has since been released on video, laserdisc, and DVD in this revised widescreen &quot;director's cut,&quot; with additional footage, director and producers' commentary, a photo and artwork archive, the original trailer, and an official time line of the film's evolution from script to screen. A must forHighlanderfans ... and you know who you are!--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AGKHC3C", "B004U7MQYC", "B004U7MQY2", "B0010YVCAM", "B000NOKAK8", "B0007DA3V6", "6305558167", "B0001NBLYK", "B00006LPCK", "B00092A1J4", "B00009MEJT", "B0001BKBGQ", "B0001ZX0GA", "B00020HCBI", "B000OYCMNU", "B0000VD12I", "B000000OAX", "B000LP6L2U", "0783241895", "B00004Y87O", "B0000CABIJ", "B003XURDAY", "B000QUCQX8", "B0000844I8", "B00AEFXKUI", "6305692688", "0783226063", "B000OVLBHG", "B00005O5B6", "B001EAWMGA", "6305428506", "079283366X", "B0019BI1DM", "B00005R2IS", "B004EPYZT4", "B0001Z37HM", "0783225946", "B00004XPPG", "B005G4TJUC", "B000B8GT92", "B00005N7Z1", "6305161879", "B0045HCJKS", "6304711891", "B00008G8LY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00AEFXIIW", "B000CCBCF8", "B0009MDPYM", "0792838041", "B001URA5W0", "B00005JA8B", "B00IKM5LXG", "B002O3Z510", "B00AEFYDM2", "B000QXDED6", "B008JFUS0U", "B00HETDQKG", "B0000VCZK2", "B001W72VPW", "B009MF5BXK", "B003UGLCIA", "B001LMAK88", "0790729342", "B0001O3YD0", "B000XA5K48", "B00AEFXT7W", "B0045HCJ9O", "B00AEFYGBA", "B0013LL2Z2", "B000ENC5YW", "B0045HCJT4", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00004Y631", "B0090SI56Y", "630471193X", "B0038ZITIE", "B0085A9HU6", "B004AOECXI", "B00000G3PA", "B000NQRR1Q", "B007STBUHI", "B004GJYRKA", "B00AEFY5B6", "0800195175", "B001MVYUQG", "B005J9ZFQG", "6304711905", "B0001Z37IG", "B000E6ESEY", "B000W1SZBS", "B00AEBBA36", "0783225814", "B002ZD3V10", "B002IPFWTE", "B000P0J0BU", "B00005JKTP", "B0024FADD8", "B003ASLJRC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001VLBDD0", "6305558167", "B0007DA3V6", "0783241895"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 91144}, "asin": "0782008372", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51T8F4PTSFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Highlander: Director's Cut 10th Anniversary Edition"}

{"description": "Even more than most of David Lynch's deliberately bizarre and idiosyncratic movies,Duneis a &quot;love-it-or-hate-it&quot; affair. An ambitious, epic, utterly mind-boggling--and, let's admit it, all-out weird--adaptation of Frank Herbert's classic science fiction novel,Duneremains one of the most controversial films in the director's exceedingly provocative career. The story (ifDunecan be said to have just one story) is complex and convoluted in the epic tradition; it has something to do with political intrigue and a planet that is home to a precious spice and gigantic sand worms. Think Shakespeare'sHenry IVwith a dash ofTremors, and set in another galaxy. But despite plenty of strangely whispered voice-overs that explain the characters' thoughts (and endlessly detailed exposition), storytelling is not really among the film's strong points. There are, however, a lot of memorably fantastic/grotesque images, an extraordinary cast, and a soundtrack featuring Toto. I told you it was weird. Among the stars are Kyle MacLachlan, Jos&eacute; Ferrer, Dean Stockwell, Brad Dourif, Sting, Kenneth McMillan, Patrick Stewart, Sean Young, and Linda Hunt.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00008RUYH", "B0000639EV", "B000053V8F"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 538359}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.47, "brand": "", "asin": "0783221487", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41N8H8B2GML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dune (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}
{"description": "Steven Spielberg's 1993 mega-hit rivalsJawsas the most intense and frightening film he'd ever made prior toSchindler's List, but it was also among his weakest stories. Based on Michael Crichton's novel about an island amusement park populated by cloned dinosaurs, the film works best as a thrill ride with none of the interesting human dynamics of Spielberg'sJaws. That lapse proves unfortunate, but there's no shortage of raw terror as a rampaging T-rex and nasty raptors try to make fast food out of the cast. The effects are still astonishing (despite the fact that the computer-generated technology has since been improved upon) and at times primeval, such as the sight of a herd of whatever-they-are scampering through a valley.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004U8P4", "B00003CXXR", "6303314015", "6301792734", "6304143184", "0783216084", "0767825411", "6304089767", "6303506291", "B00005JKDQ", "6300214060", "6301208773", "6301888901", "6302091632", "6304233639", "6302054982", "0788805533", "B00000JGEI", "6301666569", "6302453356", "6305319138", "B0000AQZYM", "6302787068", "6301744136", "B000059XXZ", "B000059XY5", "B000005QWI", "0784011923", "6304500831", "6303020089", "B000003KSM", "6302968143", "6302415853", "6300214435", "B00000490M", "6301744160", "630157401X", "6302877881", "6304007523", "6300181987", "6301661729", "6304030959", "0800198395", "0783226152", "B000062XM6", "B00005B238", "6303212263", "630596260X", "B000005PPB", "B0000048S1", "6303824382", "B000007OY0", "B000005PFL", "6300248089", "B00004RFFA", "6300213005", "6305045976", "080010367X", "6304022166", "B00006G8LB", "0790700506", "0790719029", "B00005B6ND", "0790742322", "6304196954"], "bought_together": ["B00004U8P4", "B00003CXXR"], "also_viewed": ["B00004U8P4", "B00003CXXR", "6304143184", "6301792734", "6305750750", "6304089767", "6303506291", "B0087ZG7NO", "B00005LL26", "6300214753", "6304539258", "0788806270", "0784011923", "B00005JLGL", "B0057R5XRG", "B000065U6Q", "6304400551", "0767825411", "0788805533", "6304500831", "B0002XNSYA", "6302787068", "B00000K2SC", "0780607287", "155890641X", "6304539274", "6302091632", "B00000JS61", "B0000AQZYM", "0792839129", "B00004U8KV", "B00005JKDQ", "6303313345", "0788812807", "6302526574", "6300213803", "630018403X", "6302426200", "B00005MP5C", "B000035Z2S", "080010367X", "B00023NRSM", "6301543408", "0790705141", "6304015127", "B00004R99N", "6303212379", "0783216084", "6302320402", "6304718551", "B0087ZG7J8", "B00000JGEI", "6303953425", "B005N64U52", "6303929567", "6303314015", "6302453356"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 481629}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.68, "brand": "", "asin": "0783222734", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MNFQR1V1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "It's hard to ignore the sad and conspicuous absence of the late John Belushi, but this long-delayed sequel to 1980'sThe Blues Brothersstill has Dan Aykroyd--as Chicago bad boy and blues rocker Elwood Blues--to keep the music alive. Once again, Elwood's trying to reunite the original Blues Brothers Band, and this time he's got a strip-joint bartender (John Goodman) and a 10-year-old orphan named Buster (J. Evan Bonifant) joining him at center stage. Believing that Elwood has kidnapped the kid, the cops are hot on his trail as the reunited band hits the road for the Battle of the Bands in Louisiana and the All-Star Blues Jam that ends the movie in a rockin' blaze of glory. It's a shameless clone of the first film, and nobody--especially not Aykroyd or director John Landis--seems to care that the story's not nearly as fun as the music that's used to stretch it out. Of course there's a seemingly endless parade of stunts, including a nonstop pileup of police cars that's hilariously absurd, but what really matters here--indeed, the movie's only saving grace--is the great lineup of legendary blues musicians. Aretha Franklin, James Brown, Junior Wells, Eric Clapton, B.B. King, Jonny Lang, Eddie Floyd, and Blues Traveler are among the many special guests assembled for the film, and their stellar presence makes you wonder if the revived Blues Brothers shouldn't remain an obscure opening act.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783231482"], "bought_together": ["0783231482"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 258505}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.49, "brand": "", "asin": "0783227078", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DGQ2RVTPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blues Brothers 2000 [VHS]"}
{"description": "The original cowriter and director ofFear and Loathing in Las Vegaswas Alex Cox, whose earlier filmSid and Nancysuggests that Cox could have been a perfect match in filming  Hunter&nbsp;S. Thompson's psychotropic masterpiece of \"gonzo\" journalism. Unfortunately Cox departed due to the usual \"creative differences,\" and this ill-fated adaptation was thrust upon Terry Gilliam, whose formidable gifts as a visionary filmmaker were squandered on the seemingly unfilmable elements of Thompson's ether-fogged narrative. The result is a one-joke movie without the joke--an endless series of repetitive scenes involving rampant substance abuse and the hallucinogenic fallout of a road trip that's run crazily out of control. Johnny Depp plays Thompson's alter ego, \"gonzo\" journalist Raoul Duke, and Benicio Del Toro is his sidekick and so-called lawyer Dr. Gonzo. During the course of a trip to Las Vegas to cover a motorcycle race, they ingest a veritable chemistry set of drugs, and Gilliam does his best to show us the hallucinatory state of their zonked-out minds. This allows for some dazzling imagery and the rampant humor of stumbling buffoons, and the mumbling performances of Depp and Del Toro wholeheartedly embrace the tripped-out, paranoid lunacy of Thompson's celebrated book. But over two hours of this insanity tends to grate on the nerves--like being the only sober guest at a party full of drunken idiots. So while Gilliam's film may achieve some modest cult status over the years, it's only becauseFear and Loathingis best enjoyed by those who are just as stoned as the characters in the movie.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006H32EI", "B006ISJQ1W", "B00003CXWV", "0767837398", "B002AF4Y9G", "B000A7DVR2", "B001EDFSIQ", "0679785892", "B0057ZAA6W", "6305313687", "B00029RTAI", "B0007DFJ0G", "B002QEHPQU", "B00008975Z", "B001HN69AY", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00005JM23", "B000F7CECK", "B000JMK6LW", "B000093FLA", "B000P0J09M", "B003HKN52U", "0783225903", "B00005R87R", "B004SIP95G", "B00000IRE6", "B000031EFY", "B00005ATQB", "B005Y4I6VW", "B0006HBZE2", "B00005Q4CS", "B004FQX5B6", "B009NNXQJW", "B0000VD04M", "B00006JDU8", "B00005V9HH", "B00011CZRE", "B002T9H2LA", "B000C20VPA", "B002CPMB9O", "B000AXWHSA", "B000ASDFI6", "B000P0J0D8", "0792838068", "B003W88QVC", "B00029RTCG", "B0011E5M66", "B0007PALZ2", "B00005JMJG", "B007D0FVRM", "B001J9KJ4I", "B006ISJQBM", "B000EMGJAO", "B0000CDUT5", "B000KB4898", "B0000AC8LR", "B004P7CNC2", "B004SIP7TE", "B00AEFXE9U", "B004SIP8ES", "B00AEFYS2M", "B000C20VRS", "B0000AC8LI", "B00ALU48M0", "B0009A40ES", "B000LP6KNU", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00AEBB8NI", "B0000640VJ", "B004SIP6LS", "B000286RP2", "B000GGSMC6", "0780621611", "B001HN694K", "B00009W5CA", "B004XVMCH6", "B001GCUO0W", "B000GBEWGQ", "B0006GAOJA", "B008R65XYC", "B000IY04Q8", "B000006NN1", "B000S6M1Y4", "B0012E2GFK", "B0007UC8Y4", "B0043X1FM2", "B0001CNRRU", "B00ALU46VI", "0767835093", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005NTOH", "B000MMMT9G", "B005LAIIJY", "B00AG4714S", "B00000K3TS", "B000053VAZ", "B00009MGEM", "B001M4YZ90", "B002ZG980U", "1451659717"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXWV"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0679785892", "B00029RTAI", "0783225903", "B000A7DVR2"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3274}, "asin": "0783229526", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51LL2U2I2AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"}

{"description": "Watching this director's cut, it's finally possible to see why the studio made Spielberg mercilessly hack up this comedy: it's a screaming movie (everyone screams a lot), and screaming movies do not need character development. So all those character-development scenes hit the cutting-room floor and, surprise, they were all critical to Spielberg's pace for the humor in this film. The screaming wasn't that funny then--and it still isn't--but what is funny are the reinserted development scenes, showcasing the now-evident sense of hysteria in the Los Angeles community, post-Pearl Harbor. A bunch of certified nitwits, and a few certified lunatics, act as if Tojo Hideki's entire Imperial force is just off the mainland. Actually, one Japanese submarine is, and it helps fuel the frenzy. John Belushi is Wild Bill Kelso, an insane fighter pilot, and Dan Aykroyd plays a conciliatory tank commander. Robert Stack's performance as General Stilwell, one of the best of the film, finally makes sense. Also fun for the numerous cameos, Spielberg's inside jokes, and John Williams's great score.--Keith Simanton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008438W", "B0000CBY1C", "B00014NEX0", "B00AEFY5GQ", "B000A6T22G", "B00028HBIE", "B00441GYQ0", "B00AEBB9E6", "B000A6T230", "B003ASLJPE", "B0016LFG2O", "B000K7VHTQ", "B000N4RARE", "B002N57KG2", "B00000IQW5", "B002O3Z4YI", "B008RNYMT2", "B00DJYKD0G", "0767821467", "B000FVQLKM", "0783228058", "B00005N5S3", "B00008AOTN", "0792843568", "0790742071", "B00K2CHX9C", "B00AEFY0KW", "B000063K2R", "B00L4K450G", "B00005N5S2", "B000LBL3TK", "B000096IAC", "B001DE29SI", "0783226853", "B004HZY8OS", "B00006FDCT", "0792844017", "B000055Y0X", "6305162018", "B0007TKNGA", "B0007MANZI", "B00E8G5HZ0", "B0000CGNEE", "0783227884", "B000KJU18C", "B00005QCVP", "B004QBWU02", "B000M2E30O", "B00009MEKJ", "B0017XOF50", "B00096S4B2", "B0071HPOHY", "B000FTCLR6", "B000BZISSU", "B000063UR5", "B000U1ZV6M", "B000062XF0", "B00AMSQBRQ", "B00BMJ7ZKG", "B007AFC0JC", "0782010040", "B000NQRR1G", "0790740044", "B00005JMYC", "B0039UU3EQ", "B00AEFYBA6", "B000063JDM", "B00AEFYTEY", "B00008DDXK", "B00005JKLZ"], "bought_together": ["B00008438W", "B00AEFY5GQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00H83EUQW", "B00014NEX0", "B00DL48BM6", "B0000CBY1C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 11330}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.98, "brand": "Universal", "asin": "0783231032", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41dELPkCkVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "1941 (Collector's Edition)"}

{"description": "Following the blockbuster success ofThe Exorcist, director William Friedkin had the clout to make any film he wanted, and he nearly ruined his career makingSorcerer, an ill-fated remake of the classic French thrillerThe Wages of Fear. Given the big-budget treatment that Friedkin could command, the original plot remains unchanged: In an unnamed Latin American country, Roy Scheider leads a group of four fugitives who will earn their freedom if they can successfully transport truckloads of volatile nitroglycerine over treacherous terrain to extinguish a raging oil fire. The unstable explosives could prove deadly at any point of the journey, and numerous obstacles threaten the completion of the mission. Produced under rugged conditions in the jungles of the Dominican Republic, the film is visually impressive and contains intense moments of astonishing suspense, but the specter of the superior French version hangs over every scene. This version remains a folly of directorial ambition run amuck, but for the very same reasonSorcereris a film that's hauntingly unforgettable, fueled by an atmosphere of dread and the forceful powers of nature. Presented in full-screen format on DVD, the film is aided immeasurably by Tangerine Dream's eerie electronic score.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000AQKUH2", "B005Q5WM6O", "B00JV0547O", "B000EHSVR8", "B00005JLJW", "B00I116MVQ", "B00JA3RVG4", "B00IARA8KM", "B004DSCMLA", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00IKM5OCO", "B00KSQ0N44", "B00HYRYO5O", "B00GOT11TA", "B00I0CAVWW", "B00H96KG2U", "B0008KLVA0", "B00I45844W", "B00K7IPFSM", "B00J0IN6Z4", "B00K2CHX9C", "B00J11U54K", "B00IKM5LXG", "0792838947", "B0000VLLHK", "B00KHWSB5M", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B000N3SROU", "B001PYD0KM", "B00JL6L4UY", "B00L4K450G", "B00I116MZ2", "B00JU949TK", "0061775126", "B00ICWO1LC", "B00KIZY2QA", "B00BEJL6JK", "B00004REAG", "B00J5JSV3A", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B00HW3F0X0", "B00J4LMHMK", "B0006TPDPM", "B0009GX1CE", "B00H8J2NTC", "B00CUKTHES", "B00097DY2A", "B00HW3LAF2", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00HHYF570", "B00JBGSHSQ", "B00DL48BM6", "0615928315", "B00HRJVHIQ", "B00IKM5NJS", "B00I9BU60Q", "B00GS08Y3Q", "B00005IA7Z", "B00IKM5LFY", "B0007ZEOC8", "B00H7BJ0C4", "B00K2CHW48", "B00J81S92S", "B00HEPDGKA", "B00JQYV0B4", "B00KHA99BY", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00KM9LY3Q", "B003INBNOS", "B00IKM5MIA", "B00HEPC0TS", "B00JLDTBCU", "B00GBT62PQ", "B00HRISNPM", "B00005U2KC", "B00H9HZITU", "B00HF00RJW", "B00HQF9TFO", "B00H91LWDC", "B00HVOFP12", "B00DPUB56U", "B00HQFA1VA", "B00J5LXST0", "B0000EYUCK", "B000HWZ4D4", "B00HRJVHOU", "B00JVQ7PWU", "B00HUCF420", "B00005LIRC", "B00GOT1BHC", "B00GMV8JVI", "B00HF98SPS", "B00H83EUQW", "B00EL6A8IS", "B00HEPE6MM", "B00H96KFV2", "B00JAGF9E2", "B00J5G1P2W", "B0006UEVVS"], "bought_together": ["B000AQKUH2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["6305999872", "B00K7IPFSM", "B00JVQ7PWU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 72224}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 39.95, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

{"description": "It always comes up when people are comparing their most traumatic movie experiences: \"the death of Bambi's mother,\" a recollection that can bring a shudder to even the most jaded filmgoer. That primal separation (which is no less stunning for happening off-screen) is the centerpiece ofBambi, Walt Disney's 1942 animated classic, but it is by no means the only bold stroke in the film. In its swift but somehow leisurely 69 minutes,Bambicovers a year in the life of a young deer. But in a bigger way, it measures the life cycle itself, from birth to adulthood, from childhood's freedom to grown-up responsibility. All of this is rendered in cheeky, fleet-footed style--the movie doesn't lecture, or make you feel you're being fed something that's good for you. The animation is miraculous, a lush forest in which nature is a constantly unfolding miracle (even in a spectacular fire, or those dark moments when \"man was in the forest\"). There are probably easier animals to draw than a young deer, and the Disney animators set themselves a challenge with Bambi's wobbly glide across an ice-covered lake, his spindly legs akimbo; but the sequence is effortless and charming. If Bambi himself is just a bit dull--such is the fate of an Everydeer--his rabbit sidekick Thumper and a skunk named Flower more than make up for it. Many of the early Disney features have their share of lyrical moments and universal truths, butBambiis so simple, so pure, it's almost transparent. You might borrow a phrase from Thumper and say it's downright twitterpated.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["155890641X", "0788812807", "6302642248", "0788802194", "6302320402", "6304401132", "078881172X", "6304500831", "6303314015", "6300274195", "0788812408", "6302526574", "6302787068", "6302961572", "6300274268", "6305229449", "6303983812", "0788803743", "6304089767", "B0000AQZYM", "B000035Z2S", "6305319138", "6300275310", "0788805843", "0788805533", "6303929338", "6302158095", "6302178924", "6304100507", "B00005JKDQ", "6304400551", "6305326940", "6304290888", "6304978286", "6304400225", "6305940932", "B00004R99N", "6303036813", "6301390725", "B00003CX7L", "B0000E32WB", "6304089201", "B00000ICHA", "B000B8QG3G", "B0000524CZ", "6302426200", "6304501153", "B00003CXQX", "B00005T7H6", "1558906150", "6300274608", "B00000JS61", "6303534422", "B0009SUS4Q", "6304400381", "B00004R99I", "B000009CTR", "6302484359", "6301991311", "B00005RDVV", "B0007A2GSM", "B00003CXHR", "0788811002", "B000035Z46", "B00005RRG3", "6300276554", "6303122647", "6303123244", "6304401736", "0788812181", "B00006IUM9", "1558901892", "6301948106", "6305942285", "6300277003", "B00003CWPW", "6304015127", "B00007AJLB", "B00005JL95", "0788810634", "6304873441", "6303295614", "6303939015", "0783236689", "6304117752", "B00016JF2W", "B000BAVLYS", "0788812440", "B0002YLCHE", "6302481805", "6304155972", "6303991408", "B00008Y47S", "B00003CXXI", "B000B8QG4A", "6302961661", "B00003CXQ6", "B0001I55VK", "B00004YNUH"], "bought_together": ["155890641X", "0788802194"], "also_viewed": ["155890641X", "0788802194", "6303314015", "0788812408", "6304500831", "6302526574", "6302320402", "078881172X", "6302642248", "6302787068", "0788812807", "6300274195", "6304401132", "6302961572", "6304089767", "6300274268", "0788805843", "B000035Z2S", "6304290888", "0788805533", "6305319138", "6303983812", "6305229449", "6303929338", "6300275310", "6302178924", "6304400551", "B0000AQZYM", "6302158095", "6303534422", "B00005JKDQ", "B0007KTBIU", "6305326940", "B00003CXQX", "6304501153", "6303036813", "B000B8QG3G", "6304100507", "B00004R99N", "6305940932", "B00003CXHR", "6304978286", "B000035Z46", "B00005JL95", "B00005RDVV", "B005JQFQ5Y", "B00003CX7L", "6304873441", "6304089201", "6304400225", "6302426200", "6301991311", "6304401736", "0788811002", "B0000524CZ", "6300274608", "6301390725", "B00016JF2W", "B00004REYY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 63167}, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Children's Music", "Disney"], ["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.94, "brand": "Disney", "asin": "0788806270", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DVF3SBVRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bambi (Walt Disney's Masterpiece) [VHS]"}

{"description": "Before makingBatman, director Tim Burton and star Michael Keaton teamed up for this popular black comedy about a young couple (Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) whose premature death leads them to a series of wildly bizarre afterlife exploits. As ghosts in their own New England home, they're faced with the challenge of scaring off the pretentious new owners (Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones), whose daughter (Winona Ryder) has an affinity for all things morbid. Keaton plays the mischievous Beetlejuice, a freelance &quot;bio-exorcist&quot; who's got an evil agenda behind his plot to help the young undead newlyweds.

{"description": "Paul Newman gives one of the defining performances of his career, and cemented his place as a beautiful-rebel screen icon playing the stubbornly tough and independent title character inCool Hand Luke. And before he became familiar as a sidekick in 1970s disaster movies (Earthquakeand theAirportmovies), George Kennedy won an Oscar for playing Dragline, the brutal chain-gang boss who tries to beat loner Luke's cool out of him. It's a classic rebel-against-the-repressive-institution story in the line ofOne Flew over the Cuckoo's NestorThe Shawshank Redemption. Certain moments have become classics--particularly the hardboiled egg-eating contest, and the immortal line (drooled by Strother Martin, as a sadistic redneck prison officer), &quot;What we have here is a failure to communicate.&quot; And don't forget, Luke is also the source of the oft-quoted driving ditty, &quot;I don't care if it rains or freezes, long as I have my plastic Jesus, right here on the dashboard of my car...&quot; He is cool, all right.

{"description": "It's enlightening to view Tim Burton'sMars Attacks!as his twisted satire of the blockbuster filmIndependence Day, which was released earlier the same year, although the movies were in production simultaneously. Burton's eye-popping, schlock tribute to 1950s UFO movies actually plays better on video than it did in theaters. The idea of invading aliens ray gunning the big-name movie stars in the cast is a cleverly subversive one, and the bulb-headed, funny-sounding animated Martians are pretty nifty, but it all seemed to be spread thin on the big screen. On video, however, the movie's kooky humor seems a bit more concentrated. The Earth actors (most of whom get zapped or kidnapped for alien science experiments) include Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Annette Bening, Pierce Brosnan, Danny DeVito, Martin Short, Sarah Jessica Parker, Rod Steiger, Michael&nbsp;J.

{"description": "One of the key films of the 1970s, John Boorman'sDeliveranceis a nightmarish adaptation of poet-novelist James Dickey's book about various kinds of survival in modern America. The story concerns four Atlanta businessmen of various male stripe: Jon Voight's character is a reflective, civilized fellow, Burt Reynolds plays a strapping hunter-gatherer in urban clothes, Ned Beatty is a sweaty, weak-willed boy-man, and Ronny Cox essays a spirited, neighborly type. Together they decide to answer the ancient call of men testing themselves against the elements and set out on a treacherous ride on the rapids of an Appalachian river. What they don't understand until it is too late is that they have ventured into Dickey's variation on the American underbelly, a wild, lawless, dangerous (and dangerously inbred) place isolated from the gloss of the late 20th century. In short order, the four men dig deep into their own suppressed primitiveness, defending themselves against armed cretins, facing the shock of real death on their carefully planned, death-defying adventure, and then squarely facing the suspicions of authority over their concealed actions. Boorman, a master teller of stories about individuals on peculiarly mythical journeys, does a terrifying and beautiful job of revealing the complexity of private and collective character--the way one can never be the same after glimpsing the sharp-clawed survivor in one's soul.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000FZCU", "6305123616", "0783222955", "6300214060"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 659130}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0790732009", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513K3CXF8QL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Deliverance (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "Director Oliver Stone added 17 minutes of previously unseen footage for the &quot;director's cut&quot; edition of his hypnotic courtroom epic about the investigation into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in November 1963. That fateful day in Dallas set in motion a sequence of events that would only intensify the mystery behind Kennedy's death, causing New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) to begin an investigation that would gradually become a personal obsession. Bravura filmmaking combined with controversial treatment of historical facts and audacious speculation, this breathtaking revision of history presents a mesmerizing parade of shady figures and conspiracy theories, unfolding like a classic mystery based on history's greatest unsolved crime. A technical triumph boasting Oscar-winning cinematography and editing, Stone's film is guaranteed to grab the viewer's attention with its daring take on the JFK controversy.

{"description": "The opening and closing moments of Robert (Forrest Gump) Zemeckis'sContactastonish viewers with the sort of breathtaking conceptual imagery one hardly ever sees in movies these days--each is an expression of the heroine's lifelong quest (both spiritual and scientific) to explore the meaning of human existence through contact with extraterrestrial life. The movie begins by soaring far out into space, then returns dizzyingly to earth until all the stars in the heavens condense into the sparkle in one little girl's eye. It ends with that same girl as an adult (Jodie Foster)--her search having taken her to places beyond her imagination--turning her gaze inward and seeing the universe in a handful of sand.Contacttraces the journey between those two visual epiphanies. Based on Carl Sagan's novel,Contactis exceptionally thoughtful and provocative for a big-budget Hollywood science fiction picture, with elements that recall everything from2001toThe Right Stuff. Foster's solid performance (and some really incredible alien hardware) keep viewers interested, even when the story skips and meanders, or when the halo around the golden locks of rising-star-of-a-different-kind Matthew McConaughey (as the pure-Hollywood-hokum love interest) reaches Milky Way-level wattage. Ambitious, ambiguous, pretentious, unpredictable--Contactis all of these things and more. Much of it remains open to speculation and interpretation, but whatever conclusions one eventually draws,Contactdeserves recognition as a rare piece of big-budget studio filmmaking on a personal scale.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002V7OI8", "0783225733", "B0045HCJ9O", "B004L9GMBC", "B00008G8LY", "B00003CWU3", "B0045HCJ0S", "B0006FYOTC", "0671004107", "630471193X", "B002O3Z50G", "B000VECAD0", "B004GJYRI2", "630542845X", "B00000G3PA", "B002ZG980U", "B000BYY11Y", "B00005JL3T", "B0000844I8", "B00I116MUC", "B00013RC84", "B0050MB5KM", "B0087F7VSY", "B00008OE4W", "B00006JDVV", "B0015NORDW", "B00004BZIY", "B003AWRMBA", "B00003CXXP", "B00E8G5HQE", "B00IWULQQ2", "B007Y1NNAW", "B0000A2ZO0", "0783225547", "B00005JKFR", "B001BEK8CY", "B000E6ESEO", "0767812166", "B000OA8OK4", "B00007GZR5", "6305133468", "B001GCUO02", "B005LAII3A", "0767805712", "B000NA1WDQ", "B00005JNY3", "B000YDOOHI", "B000ENC5YW", "B002NZK5UU", "079073639X", "B0043X1FL8", "B00000JMOD", "B004SIP9RO", "0783225814", "B00004YA66", "B000FVQLKW", "B00008G8M4", "B00005JOC9", "B000CEV3M8", "B000CEXEWA", "B001BRJZPW", "B001451HXO", "B0045HCJKS", "B007RGAC7G", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00AEFY3MC", "B00000IQW5", "B001ECDVK4", "B004AOECXI", "B0013FDM7E", "B000053VBK", "B002GHHHP6", "B00AEFXPSK", "B0007PLLBU", "B00AEFY0F2", "B002GHHHNI", "B000PGINMQ", "B0007TKNHE"], "bought_together": ["B0002V7OI8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004L9GMBC", "B002ZG980U", "0671004107", "B000VECAD0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 88991}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "0790733226", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412wFQ6h37L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Contact (Snap Case)"}

{"description": "Running time 127 minutes, Black and White, with original theatrical trailer. Starring Humphrey Bogart and Walter Huston, Tim Holt and Bruce Bennett, directed by John Huston.\n\nGold in the hills, avarice in the hearts of men. Two hard-luck drifters (Bogart and Holt) and a grizzled prospector (Huston) discover gold. Then greed and paranoia set in.\n\nShot mostly on location in Mexico, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre cost a then-whopping $3 million - and led to a showdown. At that price, Jack Warner argued, the top-billed Bogart shouldn't be bumped off before the finale. But director John Huston stood his ground and went on to win high honors: two Academy Awards for his direction and screenplay. And his father won the Oscar as Best Supporting Actor. Without awards, but with enduring acclaim, is Bogart's performance, transforming before our eyes from a likable hobo to a heartless thug who simmers in his own greed. A half-century later, its placement on the American Film Institute's Top 100 American Film list confirms it's still a powerful movie.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790743159", "6301968948", "6301797906", "0783222955", "B000BWIZRW", "B000BWIZTU", "6304429274", "6303402070", "0800100832", "6301978110", "6304196954", "6304111398", "630150528X", "6302816254", "B00000F13T", "0792839846", "6301977165", "6302227127", "6303109950", "6302158176", "630233683X", "0792837371", "6302353785", "630018627X", "6302032245", "0790734079", "B00005A1VH", "0792837967", "0800125762", "B00000FZCU", "6300215512", "0800132009", "0792837630", "6301801954", "630266232X", "0790743531", "6302226899", "1558807780", "1569942072", "6301800974", "6302909023", "6304259131", "6301805615", "6301798759", "B000PYKZYC", "B000006914", "0790748169", "6303393985", "6300216012", "6300268470", "B000077VT7"], "bought_together": ["0790743159"], "also_viewed": ["6305123616", "0783216084", "6303402070", "6304429274", "6301797906", "1558807780"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 418473}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0790743523", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HQXK3ZV4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre [VHS]"}

{"description": "Otto Preminger's sprawling World War II drama packs a lot into its 165 minutes, beginning with the attack on Pearl Harbor (which Preminger re-creates in amazing detail) and ending a couple of years later with America's return to the South Pacific in force. John Wayne and Kirk Douglas star as a career naval captain and his self-pitying commander in the peacetime navy who are thrust into battle when Pearl Harbor is bombed while they are on maneuvers. Minutes into WWII, they are already scapegoated and demoted by the embarrassed military brass. Wayne romances a WAVE nurse (Patricia Neal) and attempts a reconciliation with his estranged, spoiled son (Brandon de Wilde) while Douglas sinks into the bottle after the death of his cheating wife until the American fleet rebuilds and calls upon Wayne to lead one of the initial invasion forces. Henry Fonda makes a brief but commanding appearance as the fleet admiral. Burgess Meredith is a former writer turned witty commander, Dana Andrews a showy but indecisive admiral, and Stanley Holloway a genial Australian scout working with the American invasion forces. Tom Tryon and Paula Prentiss play newlyweds torn apart by the war, and also appearing are Franchot Tone, Carroll O'Conner, Slim Pickens, George Kennedy, Bruce Cabot, and Larry Hagman, among many, many more. Loyal Griggs's handsome black-and-white photography is topped only by Saul Bass's impressive closing credits sequence, a rising cascade of crashing waves and rough surf reportedly paced to mirror the dramatic rhythm of the film.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300181472", "6300988473", "6300215733", "0792106989", "6301802330", "6300208281", "B001E419N8", "6300267938", "6303057225", "6301798090", "630197705X", "0783216084", "6301325508", "6302320496", "6301736362", "B00004RFFA", "6301718275", "6301797922", "0792110188", "6303192254", "0792108868", "6300267830", "0792839846", "6304457316", "0782008348", "6304457278", "6302923042", "6304457308", "6300268748", "B000051S3Z", "6300268799", "6303599052", "B00005Q4GZ", "0792838556", "630150528X", "B000M7BEPQ", "6301662962", "6303597874", "6300183513", "0792107683", "6300184951", "6302224462", "6300246965"], "bought_together": ["6300181472"], "also_viewed": ["6303057225", "6302365945", "6303599052", "6303231799", "6301976924"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 210560}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0792102320", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NK7XC5KEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "In Harm's Way [VHS]"}
{"description": "Black comedy and suspenseful action inside a German POW camp during World War II--a setting that was later borrowed for the TV sitcomHogan's Heroes. The great director Billy Wilder adapted the hit stage play, applying his own wicked sense of humor to the apparently bleak subject matter. William Holden plays an antisocial grouse amid a gang of wisecracking though indomitable American prisoners. Because of his bitter cynicism, Holden is suspected by the others of being an informer to the Germans, an accusation he must deal with in his own crafty way. Holden, who had delivered a brilliant performance for Wilder inSunset Boulevard, won the 1953 Best Actor Oscar forStalag 17. Very much his equal, however, is Otto Preminger, an accomplished director himself, who plays the strict, sneering camp commandant.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["079284517X", "B00005Q4GY", "B00000F13T", "B0009QAT6U", "0783222955", "6303168507", "6302909023", "6301973240", "6302682606", "6304071876", "6300181472", "6305110859", "1558807780", "6304196954", "6301977297", "6302529484", "0790752395", "6300251012", "6302529441", "6303686745", "6300246965", "630150528X", "6300246868", "0800132009", "0800116917", "B0000048YO", "6302224489", "6302952581", "6301798732", "6304111398", "0783217528", "6301797906", "6301959728", "6300213676", "0790732017"], "bought_together": ["B00005Q4GY", "B00000F13T"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 315192}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0792108280", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71NMB5C9AZL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Stalag 17 [VHS]"}

{"description": "Mel Gibson's Oscar-winning 1995Braveheartis an impassioned epic about William Wallace, the 13th-century Scottish leader of a popular revolt against England's tyrannical Edward I (Patrick McGoohan). Gibson cannily plays Wallace as a man trying to stay out of history's way until events force his hand, an attribute that instantly resonates with several of the actor's best-known roles, especiallyMad Max. The subsequent camaraderie and courage Wallace shares in the field with fellow warriors is pure enough and inspiring enough to bring envy to a viewer, and even as things go wrong for Wallace in the second half, the film does not easily cave in to a somber tone. One of the most impressive elements is the originality with which Gibson films battle scenes, featuring hundreds of extras wielding medieval weapons. After Eisenstein'sAlexander Nevsky, Orson Welles'sChimes at Midnight, and even Kenneth Branagh'sHenry V, you might think there is little new that could be done in creating scenes of ancient combat; yet Gibson does it.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004XPQ6", "B00003CXE6", "6303953425", "6304935811", "B0001VL30O", "B000054OW2", "6302415853", "0790741512", "6304071876", "6301792734", "6303168507", "6303942830", "0800125762", "6300183211", "B000007OY0", "B000056BRF", "6300214540", "B000065U6Q", "B00004WIDB", "B00003CXTF", "B00007KK15", "079070546X", "B0000A36J1", "B00000K3AN", "6302482712", "6300263673", "6305169187", "0788811355", "B00003BE3X", "0800116917", "6304414099", "6303020089", "0792133153", "0790744589", "6302909023", "0800132009", "079212569X", "6300185095", "6303313345", "0767819462", "6304259131", "B00000K2SC", "0800199421", "B0001DI5W6", "B00005JLTM", "630018224X", "0790701251", "6304151306", "6303696813", "0790731274", "0792147618", "B00005RIJ3", "6301586026", "6302945089", "0783223218", "6305718792"], "bought_together": ["B00004XPQ6", "B00003CXE6"], "also_viewed": ["0792151712", "6303314015", "6301966988", "6303402348", "B00004WIDB", "0792116887", "6300213668", "0800125762", "B00004XPQ6", "0792842111", "B00003CXTF", "0788812408", "6302526574", "6303215734", "0788806270", "6300183211", "B00004U8P4", "0788802194"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 521725}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.5, "brand": "", "asin": "0792139771", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PF2QYK62L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Braveheart (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "When the theatrical release of James Cameron'sTitanicwas delayed from July to December of 1997, media pundits speculated that Cameron's $200&nbsp;million disaster epic would cause the director's downfall, signal the end of the blockbuster era, and sink Paramount Studios as quickly as the ill-fated luxury liner had sunk on that fateful night of April&nbsp;14, 1912. Some studio executives were confident, others horrified, but the clarity of hindsight turned Cameron into an Oscar-winning genius, a shrewd businessman, and one of the most successful directors in the history of motion pictures.Titanicwould surpass the $1&nbsp;billion mark in global box-office receipts (largely due to multiple viewings, the majority by teenage girls), win 11&nbsp;Academy Awards including best picture and director, produce the best-selling movie soundtrack of all time, and make a global superstar of Leonardo DiCaprio. A bona fide pop-cultural phenomenon, the film has all the ingredients of a blockbuster (romance, passion, luxury, grand scale, a snidely villain, and an epic, life-threatening crisis), but Cameron's alchemy of these ingredients proved more popular than anyone could have predicted. His stroke of genius was to combine absolute authenticity with a pair of fictional lovers whose tragic fate would draw viewers into the heart-wrenching reality of theTitanicdisaster. As starving artist Jack Dawson and soon-to-be-married socialite Rose DeWitt Bukater, DiCaprio and Kate Winslet won the hearts of viewers around the world, and their brief but never-forgotten love affair provides the humanity that Cameron needed to turnTitanicinto an emotional experience. Present-day framing scenes (featuring Gloria Stuart as the 101-year-old Rose) add additional resonance to the story, and although some viewers proved vehemently immune to Cameron's manipulations, few can deny the production's impressive achievements. Although some of the computer-generated visual effects look artificial, others--such as the sunset silhouette ofTitanicduring its first evening at sea, or the climactic splitting of the ship's sinking hull--are state-of-the-art marvels. In terms of sets and costumes alone, the film is never less than astounding. More than anything else, however, the film's overwhelming popularity speaks for itself.Titanicis an event film and a monument to Cameron's risk-taking audacity, blending the tragic irony of theTitanicdisaster with just enough narrative invention to give the historical event its fullest and most timeless dramatic impact.Titanicis an epic love story on par withGone with the Wind, and like that earlier box-office phenomenon, it's a film for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305123616", "6304117752", "6301792734", "6303215734", "B00000JS61", "6304178352", "6303396623", "6303314015", "B00003CXTF", "0769403468", "6301734734", "6302936381", "6303300480", "6305368139", "B00005RRG3", "6302610702", "0792839846", "6300207919", "B000P0J0C4", "6304546262", "B000056BRF", "6304400551", "6303101267", "630150528X", "6303637574", "B000P0J0EW", "6305126062", "6302935148", "0800199421", "6304681496", "0792116887", "6301963911", "B0000DCGT1", "B00001IVED", "6305169187", "B00006RCST", "6300216721", "630197879X", "0800113055", "076780922X", "080010367X", "0800141326", "0800184319", "6304039522", "B000066AXC"], "bought_together": ["6305123616"], "also_viewed": ["B009VQHDSQ", "6303314015", "B0074JODXU", "B00003CXTF", "B003JQZXWW", "6302787068", "6301796535", "0788812807", "0788806270", "B00005JKDQ", "6304500831", "6305229449", "6304117752", "6300213668", "6304089767", "B0000AQZYM", "079213690X", "6303049079", "6305123616", "6303402348", "6301792734", "0788812408", "B00079HZSE", "B000035Z2S", "B00000K3AN", "0788805843", "6302526574", "B0000029YC", "6303534422", "6303215734", "B0070285YE", "B00008LDO9", "0783216084", "6304434340", "B00BBND56G", "0788805533", "6300183211", "6302320402", "6305750750", "B0002CHI3S", "0790748266", "6304143184", "B0000040CM", "B005X7H9SQ", "B00004RFHF", "B00005V1Z7", "6302814782", "6301572688", "B00000JS61", "B008SLUWZG", "6303257844", "B00078XGO2", "0790736039", "B0000040EJ", "B000065U6Q", "B00003CX7L", "B00000ADKZ", "6300263673", "6302178924"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 65950}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.47, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "0792151712", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21BAWEVBJ1L.jpg", "title": "Titanic [VHS]"}
{"description": "What a combo! Tobe Hooper, the director ofThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre, teamed up with family-oriented producer Steven Spielberg to makePoltergeist. The film is about a haunted suburban tract home in a development very much like the Arizona one in which Spielberg was raised. (Because it came out the same summer as Spielberg'sE.T., it was tempting to see both movies as representing Spielberg's ambivalent feelings about childhood in suburbia. One was a fantasy, the other a nightmare.)  Spielberg also cowrote the screenplay, which taps into primal, childlike fears of monsters under the bed, monsters in the closet, sinister clown faces, and all manner of things that go bump in the night. At first, some of the odd happenings in the house are kind of funny and amusing, but they grow gradually creepier until the film climaxes in a terrifying special-effects extravaganza when 5-year-old Carole Anne (Heather O'Rourke) is kidnapped by the spooks and held hostage in another dimension. Though not nearly as frightening as Hooper's magnum opus, or the originalA Nightmare on Elm Street, which came along two years later,Poltergeistis one of the smartest and most entertaining horror pictures of its time.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00009PY4G", "B00006FDCD", "B00AEFYYH6", "B007STBUHI", "B004SIP92O", "B00004BZIY", "B000VECAD0", "B00000IQC4", "B00005A8XX", "B004LWZW24", "B001B1872U", "B009XTF8KQ", "B00386EZUY", "B000HCO86I", "B00005JOJE", "B0087F7VSY", "B001D2WU9I", "B000PMLJMQ", "B000067FP8", "B000E1P2EY", "B003PIUINI", "B0009X763M", "B000WC3864", "B003UN0752", "B002I41KNC", "B0021L8UFI", "B005GT3X68", "B000P0J0A6", "B0087ZG7PW", "B00AIBZLVY", "B0045HCJJE", "B000ASATZ8", "B0000VCZK2", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00005JNTI", "B000E33W1W", "B00008LUNW", "B00AEBBA2W", "B000CCBC9O", "B0006SGYL0", "B000FAOC2W", "B00008WFU4", "B000OA8OK4", "B00005JNNT", "B001AGXEAG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004TDTO", "B00004BZIY", "B000VECAD0", "B00006FDCD"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 69740}, "asin": "0792833201", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31ZsC3YTJ5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Poltergeist"}

{"description": "This was the first James Bond adventure produced after the success ofStar Wars, so it jumped on the sci-fi bandwagon by combining the suave appeal of Agent 007 (once again played by Roger Moore) with enough high-tech hardware and special effects to make Luke Skywalker want to join Her Majesty's Secret Service. After the razzle-dazzle ofThe Spy Who Loved Me, this attempt to latch onto a trend proved to be a case of overkill, even though it brought back the steel-toothed villain Jaws (Richard Kiel) and scored a major hit at the box office. This time Bond is up against a criminal industrialist named Drax (Michel Lonsdale) who wants to control the world from his orbiting space station. In keeping with his well-groomed style, Bond thwarts this maniacal Neo-Hitler's scheme with the help of a beautiful, sleek-figured scientist (played by Lois Chiles with all the vitality of a department-store mannequin). There's a grand-scale climax involving space shuttles and ray guns, but despite the film's popular success, this is one Bond adventure that never quite gets off the launching pad. It's as if the caretakers of the James Bond franchise had forgotten that it's Bond--and not a barrage of gizmos and gadgets (including a land-worthy Venetian gondola)--that fuels the series' success. Despite Moore's passive performance (which Pauline Kael described as &quot;like an office manager who is turning into dead wood but hanging on to collect his pension&quot;),Moonrakerhad no problem attracting an appreciative audience, and there are even a few renegade Bond-philes who consider it one of their favorites.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000RPCK1K", "B000NIBUR6", "B000M53GLS", "B000RPCK24", "B000M53GN6", "B000RPCK1A", "B000RPCK0Q", "B000NDEXPM", "B000NIBUS0", "B001R10BN2", "B000M53GMW", "B000RPCK1U", "B000M53GNG", "B000NIBURQ", "B000M53GM2", "B000NDEXPC", "B00004RG62", "B001EDVNNU", "B000M53GMC", "B00004WEJZ", "B001PPLIEG", "B00AQSN7HE", "B007REV4T8", "B00005JL0I", "B009PN18R2", "B004BR7XLM", "B008YAPQX4", "B000067J15", "B00AZFECBS", "B00006BH8G", "B00AZFECJU", "B009RO9LKK", "B00AZFECL8", "B00000BLFI", "B009L6VWRO", "B000HT3PF6", "B009NUUBBQ", "B001AQT0WW", "B0000BYRO9", "B0001ENZLQ", "B009NUTPAO", "B009NUV0E8", "B0014C2FX8", "B009L6UDUG", "B00008K76U", "B005LAII44", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001U6YI9W", "B00AZFECS6", "B000O599YY", "B00AVWIQZS", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B007STBUHI", "B0045HCJ9O", "B004OB2EYQ", "B003Q6D2B4", "B00005PJ8S", "B004EPYZUS", "B008JFUO72", "1612185452", "B00005ATZT", "B00DZFKNFO", "B0000BYRO7", "B000BZISSU", "B00001U0BN", "B00AEFYENK", "B0014Z4ON4", "B001AQMBIC", "B0000UJL96", "B004L9GMBC", "B001PO6FF4", "B000FO0AA6", "B0000AUHOH", "B00009NHC0", "0792839064", "B000MGTQ7U", "B00005JLRQ", "B001AQO3WO", "0783226039", "B00AEBB8VK", "B00005JKU0", "B0013LL2Z2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000RPCK24", "B000M53GN6", "B001R10BN2", "B000NDEXPM"]}, "price": 11.94, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 283251}, "asin": "0792838033", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513267YK57L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Moonraker THX Edition"}
{"description": "Jean-Claude Van Damme, a.k.a. \"the Muscles from Brussels,\" had only a few movies to his credit when he played the hero in this lame postapocalyptic action flick from 1989. It's really just another martial-arts movie, dressed down with near-future trash and dirty sets that have \"low budget\" written all over them. Van Damme plays the protective escort for a half-human, half-cyborg woman whose programming contains a possible cure for a plague that's threatening to wipe out the entire population of Earth. But the woman is kidnapped by Van Damme's evil nemesis (is there any other kind?) while they are en route to her Atlanta headquarters.

{"description": "Thief's dark noir spaces are tinged with the neon palette that has become the trademark of director Michael Mann (Miami Vice,Heat).  This was his first theatrical film, and all the elements that characterize his later style (and this is averystylistic film) are dominant.  Equal parts grit and glamour, the story is simple.  Frank (James Caan) is a lone-wolf jewel thief who was, in his words, brought up \"by the state.\"  In prison he was apprenticed to a master thief, played by Willie Nelson.  When Frank's successful career comes to the attention of an avuncular syndicate boss (Robert Prosky), Frank is offered (and accepts against his better judgment) a deal that should allow him to retire and enjoy the family life he covets.  But the deal sours, and Frank is left to decide what his nature truly is, lone wolf or family man.Thiefmelds its jazzy visual style with heightened realism: the jewel thief's tools of the trade are authentic, up to the 8,000 degree thermal lance  used to cut through a nearly impregnable safe.  Some of the bit parts are played by real-life, highly successful jewel thieves, who acted as consultants.  And their presence informs the superb dialogue, as every word  rings true. In one long, engrossing scene, James Caan gradually persuades the woman he wants to start a family with (Tuesday Weld in one of her most affecting performances) that they should be together.  The film was photographed beautifully by Donald Thorin  and further emboldened by the driving rhythms of Tangerine Dream.  The DVD contains a very funny commentary track by the director and James Caan.--Jim Gay", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFY3TA", "B0007ZEOC8", "B00005JLJW", "B0000074CG", "B00005QCVU", "B00GKP70L6", "B00HT2L7VS", "B0009GX1CE", "0792840453", "B00005A8TX", "B000UGBOT0", "0792838300", "B000P0J0AG", "B004DSCMLA", "B00005UQ9T", "B00097DY2A", "B0007VZ99E", "B005FQ2HBO", "B0008KLVA0", "B00I116MZ2", "B00006JMPS", "B004LB5F9U", "B00HT2RTU6", "B0008ENHTY", "B000AQKUG8", "B004YCKKFK", "B00E18QKJ2", "0767824555", "B000244EWO", "B003O7I6SE", "B00003CWRX", "B001TIQT6G", "B00005K3NV", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00005U2KC", "B000LC4ZBW", "B002AO004A", "B0001FGBW0", "B000EHSVR8", "B0000DI87S", "B00J5LXST0", "B000N3SROA", "B00AEFY9YY", "B0003JANSW", "B000286RP2", "B00005K3NU", "B00JAGF9E2", "B0000542CB", "B00008MTW1", "B000059TFP", "B001B1UO7G", "B0049M7BHA", "B000QXDFRG", "B000NTMA0G", "B00AEFXRG0", "B000HWZ4D4", "B00AEBB8LA", "B00AEFYTMQ", "B000063US3", "B00JX3SHIC", "B00005JN2Z", "B008FYZHHE", "B001CC7PM6", "B0000BUZKP", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B0006HBV3C", "B001GCATWK", "B00BN3EE14", "B000000I71", "B000063K2Q", "B00AEFXJF4", "B00G92TYCI", "B000PKG6OE", "0767818083", "B00005JLEJ", "B001C0I61M", "B0007MAO0C", "B00AEFXORM", "B00AEBB95K", "B0006TPDPM", "B00004REAG", "B000BR6QCI", "B004C2523M", "B00407PNY2", "B000002N4J", "0792833279", "B00005BKZI", "B007N5YJMA", "6304765258", "B000E5LEVA", "B000AQKUH2", "B000CNESTE", "B00GST8U4U", "6305999872", "B0008ENHUS", "B00006RCNV", "B00AEFXBG6", "B005152C9G", "B00AEBB9N2"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFY3TA", "B0007ZEOC8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["078322947X", "B00J2PQYYK", "B00F98FOFY", "B00F98FOI6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 24977}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.79, "brand": "MGM", "asin": "0792838947", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H17HXGBSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Thief (Special Director's Edition)"}

{"description": "Rain Manis the kind of touching drama that Oscars are made for--and, sure enough, the film took Academy honors for best picture, director, screenplay, and actor (Dustin Hoffman) in 1988. Hoffman plays Raymond, an autistic savant whose late father has left him $3 million in a trust. This gets the attention of his materialistic younger brother, a hot-shot LA car dealer named Charlie (Tom Cruise) who wasn't even aware of Raymond's existence until he read his estranged father's will. Charlie picks up Raymond and takes him on a cross-country journey that becomes a voyage of discovery for Charlie, and, perhaps, for Raymond, too.Rain Manwill either captivate you or irritate you (Raymond's sputtering of repetitious phrases is enough to drive anyone crazy), but it is obviously a labor of love for those involved. Hoffman had been attached to the film for many years, as various directors and writers came and went, but his persistence eventually paid off--kind of like Raymond in Las Vegas.

But when he meets his best friend's sexy intellectual mistress, Mary (Diane Keaton), Isaac falls head over heels in lust!

{"description": "Thirteen-year-old Jenna (Shana Dowdeswell) has had enough with the trials of adolescence. In addition to being saddled with a devoted-but-nerdy best friend, Matt (Sean Marquette), she falls victim to one of the dangers of playing Seven Minutes in Heaven with the coolest kids in school: being stranded without a willing make-out partner. Humiliated, Jenna buries herself in the aforementioned make-out closet, wishing she could skip the whole adolescence bit and move straight into adulthood, and miraculously wakes up just weeks away from her 30th birthday. Of course, a lot has changed since going to bed the night before, not the least of which being an impressive set of womanly curves. The new, older Jenna (Jennifer Garner) is a successful magazine editor with friends in high places and a lion's share of potential suitors -- including a hockey-playing boyfriend and a swarthy married man. The problem is that her mind hasn't matured with her body; Jenna not only finds living on her own more terrifying than cool, but is quick to dismiss any male over the age of 14 as \"gross.\" Half excited, half mortified, Jenna seeks out Matt (Mark Ruffalo), whom she learns she had spurned as a teenager in an effort to join the popular crowd.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006ZXSL", "B00AKGG6JS", "B00005O5CM", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B0015I2RT8", "B001OQCUYI", "B00005JMCW", "B001OQCUZM", "B00003CXSM", "B000J103OI", "B00AEFYM2S", "B002K0WBXW", "B00AEBB8R4", "B000EMGICS", "B004SIP9X8", "B003LSFM6U", "B0000897EG", "B000ELJAEM", "B00AEFY99O", "1401324142", "6304765266", "1416205152", "B00GO37I8Y", "0809229374", "B0001XAR1I", "B0001Z3TXE", "B00005JM55", "B00AEFYWQY", "B00007E2F5", "B0002VYOVI", "B00KS9V6EC", "B000J4QW7W", "B000YDBPAM", "B0007PLLBU", "B001TUZD8O", "B002ZG988M", "B0009OL7Z4", "B004SIP9RO", "B0000ZMGWK", "1400050138", "B0000DZ6N3", "B00AQS803A", "6302077818", "B00006ZXSK", "B00005JN0Z", "B000YAA68C", "B0007LXPBI", "B00E4Z7FQY", "B002P413IC", "B001ASQ9OM", "B006YTGL86", "B00795C5X4", "B00063KGPU", "B000BVM1S2", "B000209KMW", "B000A343RI", "B00062IVN0", "B000P0J0DS", "B00002SSKI", "6305428425", "B003TY2SWC", "B0051GLDVS", "B00008K7AM", "B0071HPOGK", "B0000AKCJK", "B000023VTP", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00006FMUW", "B002XTXG8O", "B00AMEZDJW", "B001AEF6BS", "B00447L4KA", "B000MQC9H4", "6305428042", "B002GOAH1U", "B0036TGSIK", "B002A5EBMQ", "B0000AOV4I", "B001C5LLQ4", "B000324Y98", "B00005JG6N", "6305236569", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B004EPZ070", "B003L20ICE", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00AEBBA2M", "B00005JN3W", "B0075RREYG", "B000F2BNW2", "0783235070", "B0021L8UO4", "0800177258", "B002SYAGNC", "B000HT386M", "B0007P0Y7C", "B000QUU4LY", "B00006ZXSN", "B00AEBB9WI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0013D8LFY", "B002K0WBXW", "B00AKGG6JS", "B001OQCUZM"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 461629}, "asin": "1404918051", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EO6%2BQ3jvL.jpg", "title": "13 Going on 30: Fun &amp; Flirty Edition"}

{"description": "Regardless of whether it was \"too early\" in 2006 to dramatize the events of September 11th, 2001, \"World Trade Center\" succeeds as a tribute to the courage and sacrifice of those who served at \"ground zero\" in the wake of terrorist attacks on the WTC's twin towers in New York City. Removed from the politics of war and terrorism (yet still, like all films, inherently political in expressing its point of view), Oliver Stone's potent drama focuses on the nightmarish ordeal, and subsequent rescue, of Port Authority policemen John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and Will Jimeno (Michael Pe?a), who were buried deeply within the rubble of the WTC after the twin towers collapsed. Granted, it's only the film's historical context that distinguishes it from any other dramatic rescue story, but in focusing on the goodness of humanity in response to the evil of terrorists who remain unnamed and off-screen, Stone and first-time screenwriter Andrea Berloff create an emotional context as powerful as anything Stone has directed since \"Platoon\". Even as he resorts to some questionable tactics typically lacking in subtlety, Stone refrains from much of the blunt-force filmmaking that has made him a critical punching bag, rising to this challenging occasion with a heartfelt and deeply American portrait of unity ' personal, familial, and national.

{"description": "Superior to Martin Scorsese's punishing 1991 remake, this 1962 thriller directed by J. Lee Thompson (The Guns of Navarone) stars Robert Mitchum as a creepy ex-con angry at the attorney (Gregory Peck) whom he believes is responsible for his incarceration. After Mitchum makes clear his plans to harm Peck's family, a fascinating game of crisscrossing ethics and morality takes place. Where the more recent version seemed trapped in its explicitness, Thompson's film accomplishes a lot with a more economical and telling use of violence. The result is a richer character study with some Hitchcockian overtones regarding the nature of guilt.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301973232", "6301798759", "6302360978", "6302757096", "0790743159", "6302413435", "0800100832", "B00005B238", "6304429274", "6300183580", "6301798732", "6300216500", "6303402070", "0783235682", "6305012792", "6300181723", "630266232X", "6303039693", "0792838556", "079284517X", "6301975987", "6302158176", "6301805615", "6302484421", "0783235674", "0783236352"], "bought_together": ["6301973232"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 351347}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.97, "brand": "", "asin": "1558808590", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51V52EWT2CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cape Fear [VHS]"}
{"description": "Director Billy Wilder (Sunset Boulevard) and writer Raymond Chandler (The Big Sleep) adapted James M. Cain's hard-boiled novel into this wildly thrilling story of insurance man Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), who schemes the perfect murder with the beautiful dame Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck): kill Dietrichson's husband and make off with the insurance money. But, of course, in these plots things never quite go as planned, and Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) is the wily insurance investigator who must sort things out. From the opening scene you know Neff is doomed, as the story is told in flashback; yet, to the film's credit, this doesn't diminish any of the tension of the movie. This early film noir flick is wonderfully campy by today's standards, and the dialogue is snappy (\"I thought you were smarter than the rest, Walter. But I was wrong. You're not smarter, just a little taller\"), filled with lots of \"dame\"s and \"baby\"s. Stanwyck is the ultimate femme fatale, and MacMurray, despite a career largely defined by roles as a softy (notably in the TV seriesMy Three Sonsand the movieThe Shaggy Dog), is convincingly cast against type as the hapless, love-struck sap.--Jenny Brown", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300215644", "0783236352", "6304039530", "6303402070", "6301975987", "6302226899", "6301973410", "6300215512", "6300183580", "6300183513", "6304457316", "B001D8W7EK", "6301640667", "6304359705", "6302909023", "6305999872", "B000003KE0", "0783221347", "6304429274", "0792837096", "6301797906", "630197350X", "0769403468", "B00AEFXN9G", "6301797957", "B00023P4FQ", "6304039506", "0790743213", "B001D8W7F4", "6305123616", "0783217390", "6302360978", "6302041090", "0800100832", "B000EVD38G", "6301773586", "0792839846", "B001D8W7EU", "B00008LDNZ", "6304119046", "6301798503", "0782008348", "630196697X", "6301969316", "6305012792", "0783235674", "B000AV4RQ2", "0792841409", "6301966430", "6300181421", "6301973232", "6301973259", "6302413400", "0792110269", "6303057225", "6302413435", "B001BZQMFA", "0800113055", "6300181405", "B000GX7MMA", "B000M7BEPQ", "6304111363", "6302227135", "6303396623", "6304039522", "1569942072", "B0045HCJ9E", "6302484383", "6302238331", "6300215741", "6301978536", "B00004TYS8", "6302700949", "0783217528", "0783235607", "6301586042", "6301976061", "B0047M6Y66", "0792841026", "6301800974", "6301798708", "0792837967", "6301798732", "6300181367", "B00005Q4GZ", "630266232X", "B0000040EO", "0790734079", "6302725542", "6300269310", "0783235682", "6301963911", "6301798562", "6301969049", "0792108280", "6300251012", "6302801133", "1558804226", "0792101448", "0764007440"], "bought_together": ["0783236352"], "also_viewed": ["B00I3C1T1Q", "6301797906", "6304429274", "6305123616", "B000005PPB", "B0050FXDDQ", "0800116917", "6301976983", "6304117752", "0783216084", "6303402070", "0792837096", "6304039522", "6301964012", "0792839846", "B009YX8MSG", "B00GST8UB8", "B00JAQJMJ0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 171937}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.0, "brand": "", "asin": "1558807780", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5164XM9AE3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Double Indemnity [VHS]"}
{"description": "Considered by many to be the greatest B&nbsp;movie ever made, the original-release version of Orson Welles's film noir masterpieceTouch of Evilwas, ironically, never intended as a B&nbsp;movie at all--it merely suffered that fate after it was taken away from writer-director Welles, then reedited and released in 1958 as the second half of a double feature. Time and critical acclaim would eventually elevate the film to classic status (and Welles's original vision was meticulously followed for the film's 1998 restoration), but for four decades this original version stood as a testament to Welles's directorial genius. From its astonishing, miraculously choreographed opening shot (lasting over three minutes) to Marlene Dietrich's classic final line of dialogue, this sordid tale of murder and police corruption is like a valentine for the cinematic medium, with Welles as its love-struck suitor. As the corpulent cop who may be involved in a border-town murder, Welles faces opposition from a narcotics officer (Charlton Heston) whose wife (Janet Leigh) is abducted and held as the pawn in a struggle between Heston's quest for truth and Welles's control of carefully hidden secrets. The twisting plot is wildly entertaining (even though it's harder to follow in this original version), but even greater pleasure is found in the pulpy dialogue and the sheer exuberance of the dazzling directorial style.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302281849", "B001BZQMFA", "0783236352", "1558807780", "0783221347", "0782008348", "630266232X", "630347327X", "6305012792", "6302655897", "6302413400", "6302413435"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 403157}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.88, "brand": "", "asin": "1558804226", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G3Y343C4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Touch of Evil [VHS]"}
{"description": "When producer Joe Roth was named head of Walt Disney Studios in 1998, he was always cited as the first studio head who had also worked as a movie director. What no one ever seemed to mention is that Roth was a wholly mediocre moviemaker, as evidenced by this film and his other two titles (includingRevenge of the Nerds 2). This formula comedy, set in the summer of 1963 (which, as everyone knows, was the summer before America lost its innocence with the Kennedy assassination), is about three brothers whose tyrannical father (Joseph Bologna) commands them to jointly drive a brand-new Cadillac from Detroit to Florida, where Dad will present it to their mom as a birthday present. And God help them if they get so much as a scratch on it.

This distinguished production, starring Anthony Hopkins and Robert Foxworth, captures the vitality, intensity, and humanity of two who were entrusted by Christ with history's greatest stewardship-- the carrying of the Gospel to all the world. They faced violent opposition from without and constant turmoil from within. Based on the Scriptures by and about Peter and Paul, we see how they were driven by a heavenly vision for a different kind of world.

{"description": "This 1989 rouser is apocalyptic pulp--the bloodiest, showiest, most shamelessly sentimental specimen of Hong Kong's gangster melodramas. A torch singer named Jennie (Sally Yeh) is accidentally blinded during a slaying in a night club, and Chow Yun-fat's sad-eyed Jeff, a self-lacerating assassin, drags himself out of retirement to take on one last job--rubbing out a major mobster for major bucks--so he can pay for the singer's cornea transplant operation. But Jeff pauses to ferry a wounded child to the hospital during this final outing, and because of this a cop finally gets a good look at him: \"He was seen on the job,\" snarls a saturnine Mr. Big, \"and I want him wasted.\" Armies of thugs converge on the saintly slayer. Some of writer-director John Woo's flourishes are kitsch classics (doves flying upward in a candlelit church), while the action sequences are rapturous. \"Life's cheap,\" a character opines. \"It only takes one bullet,\" but in this case it actually takes about a dozen spewing bullet hits to kill anyone, as soulful triads in mirror shades and duster overcoats blaze away with high-tech weaponry.

{"description": "Gospel According to Al Greenis a fascinating 1984 documentary  about soul music's most insinuating singer, Al Green. Directed by Robert Mugge, it captures an expansive Green talking about his career and performing in front of a military crowd in a hotel ballroom. Green's high, seductive voice, passionate performing style, and sinewy stage presence make the musical sections of the film compelling--even if you're not a fan of gospel music. Because, at this particular juncture in his career, that's what Green was performing, though the songs have the slow-boiling insistence of his best soul songs. In the interview segments, Green talks about how he wrote his songs and the religious conversion experience he underwent that caused him to put his pop-music career aside and serve the Lord--and how, when he gets cooking onstage, people don't seem to care that when he's singing about \"Love and Happiness,\" he's praising God's name, rather than singing to a woman. Green, notoriously press-shy, is remarkably open discussing his tragic encounter with a spurned lover, who dumped boiling grits on him and then killed herself.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004LFO0OM", "B00A3Z1C9A", "B001CLG78A", "B00006GOF5", "1556528108", "B0001GH72W", "B0002VEORC", "B000002SYY", "B000053VAA", "B003LPV3TS", "B0000027QP", "B00E4V09LQ", "B004NHRGPS", "B00009PJQJ", "B000BKDNW6", "B00E8RVSFC", "B003KWWDJG", "B00004S38Z", "B001675YUW", "B004T1RAWW", "B00I0CAVV8", "B00004T6T1", "B000UD2K32", "B00AMEZCPM", "B000F3AIN6", "B0014JKL6Y", "B0001WTVF2", "B001GQXY0U", "B000T4SX2O", "B000050IN5", "B000TXNDMU", "B002QVTBEM", "B001OSC4HY", "B00AN10NDK", "B000Y9PC6O", "B0002WT0TS", "B001R0KH3M", "B00DW5IKNO", "B000UGG4YA", "B0000648YL", "B000F9TCUA", "B00171NZDU", "B009XJVKEY", "B0007SMCWY", "B0009EST8C", "B00GSBQ2HU", "B00CB5ERHY", "B00064AMDU", "B00078FAKK", "B0000641AP", "B000087F5D", "B002DKF460", "B000W8ONXA", "B0084I9QIW", "B0017PD1SU", "B001G9LVB6", "B001TIQTAC", "B0000060NH", "B008SOSB0G", "B00EJU9GQ6", "B00GOZ2LPM", "B000DXSEN4", "B002WH0ZAE", "B0007QJ1PM", "B0006HBL96", "B00007FOMQ", "B000294U6E", "B001TIQTA2", "B004EFN6C6", "B0016A2FFG", "B000LW7OYM", "B000056O02", "B005XQKBGO", "B001P3SA94", "B007PVHANM", "B0017UAVNS", "B001FB17BY", "B000OONQAI", "B00000K576", "B000X418HW", "B00E1LR2B4", "B00008J2HC", "B0017UAWLY", "B002BO2RWW", "B0006N2EVO", "B00884S0RA", "B00DRQEU9Q", "B000C20VCI", "B000UCWK1U", "B00005JND5", "B000R348VM", "B000IONJHY", "B0000060NN", "B005QKYJGK", "B000GW8RYI", "B000EPFDAI", "0062238396", "B000UB054U", "B00HUQC442", "B00005QD0B"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004LFO0OM", "B00A3Z1C9A", "B000002SYY", "B00006GOF5"]}, "price": 9.99, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Christian"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Gospel"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 387154}, "asin": "157252409X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/714TVAB6TTL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Al Green: Gospel According to Al Green"}

In her  search for violent video footage, she stumbles onto what may be a real live  snuff film, a videotape that her professor was watching before his untimely death.

When she uncovers one too many secrets lying in the catacombs of the university basement, she realizes that she may be the next victim. It goes on perhaps too long, and Amen&aacute;bar's pointed observations  on the lure of violence and the dark side of human nature are lost as the spiraling mystery spins into a first-person nightmare, but his skill at weaving a paranoid world where evil may lurk behind every friendly face is undeniable.Thesisis reminiscent of Brian De Palma's early thrillers: dark, stylish, subdued, and bubbling with the characters' guilty (and ultimately dangerous) fascination with the transgressive.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005LZOD", "B000274TLW", "B0036TGSJE", "B00005N8A9", "B001FOPOD8", "B0015ET3YO", "B0028DRGDQ", "B000O76ZQC", "B00006G8G3", "B000FUTV50", "B006KSAPV0", "B002FHGESI", "B00AZMFKXK", "B0015ET3YY", "B0014VPFVS", "B003EYVXXW", "B00125WATQ", "B00GHH9GSC", "B0041KKYF6", "B008S2NABI", "B002M2T1V8", "B000K2V7F0", "B0006OJH0E", "B001MYIXAC", "B00DPJEW3O", "B0051T46YG", "B003VL3UR0", "B003Q6D246", "B0087MN9HO", "B009VO9XSG", "B0009X75EC", "B009M4KSL6", "B004C00EM8", "B00080Z53O", "B001VG2MAI", "B00559ARHM", "B008Y1YK7G", "B002IRYYD2", "B002M2T1VI", "B000KRNMO4", "B00006AUIG", "B002LK3E0A", "B000I8OOG0", "B00HF98SY4", "B001AIQ154", "B002E2QH8G", "B00B58943U", "B0083H6ATW", "B002VECLXC", "B009AVCA6W", "B00005JNCZ", "B004KDYR20", "B00DOZNGTK", "B006PTL1GC", "B000Q7ZLRY", "B000OU082G", "B00BNAE2AU", "B00DBNLAZW", "B00008O34X", "B00AJXO4FA", "B00008G8YT", "B00AWHDFIU", "B0002JELZO", "B002945DUW", "B000S0GYRU", "B000LXHFMW", "B000BVM240", "B000JTIFIQ", "B0048LPRCS", "B004SUDQ04", "B000KRNG54", "B0083H6AWE", "B0048LPRD2", "B0058ZPNUE", "B00BCMT1I2", "B002OVO18A", "B0081HLM2E", "B00GBT62PQ", "B00ESZZO4A", "B004WMOSKA", "B0043VUHV4", "B00000F527", "B00GGY4R3K", "B00AG472DS", "B00020HAN8", "B000FZEU3I", "B00003CXZ4", "B008QOH0YG", "B003AHH7KQ", "B000FFL2W0", "B001MULER0", "B000G2YD32", "B003KKQUVA", "B000MTAXRY", "B003863KHI", "B00AIANIYC", "B000MQC8WU", "B000VSDNI2", "B009874S68", "B00004W1AC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000K2V7F0", "B00005LZOD", "B0015ET3YO", "B00006G8G3"]}, "price": 17.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 276165}, "asin": "1928639011", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71BG70R620L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Thesis"}

{"description": "When Columbia Pictures sought to pair Mae West and W.C. Fields in a film, neither was thrilled, but since both stars' careers were on the skids, they agreed to the project. They fought about everything: script, billing, casting, philosophy, work habits, style. Onscreen, Fields is always the butt of his own jokes. West never is. He's all broad slapstick, she, all sly innuendo. In the film West hangs onto her precious image--that inimitable combo of sexiness and wit--as Fields systematically subverts it.

Philadelphia will do.\" In her ideal happy ending, West's Flower Belle finds true love--with two men--the Masked Bandit and the town muckraker, Wayne Carter (Dick Foran).The film's funniest scenes involve Field's futile attempts to get West into a compromising position: \"I have some very definite pear-shaped ideas I'd like to discuss with thee.\" Suffice it to say that Fields ends up in bed with a goat.--Laura Mirsky", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302798434", "078322835X", "630018305X", "6300186016"], "bought_together": ["6302798434"], "also_viewed": ["6302798434"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 325922}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.87, "brand": "", "asin": "6300181294", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5196A24E18L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "My Little Chickadee [VHS]"}

The plot ofRopeis simple and based on a successful stage play: two young men (John Dall and Farley Granger) commit murder, more or less as an intellectual exercise. They hide the body in their large apartment, then throw a dinner party. Will the body be discovered? Director Alfred Hitchcock, fascinated by the possibilities of the long-take style, decided to shoot this story as though it were happening in one long, uninterrupted shot. Since the camera can only hold one 10-minute reel at a time, Hitchcock had to be creative when it came time to change reels, disguising the switches as the camera passed behind someone's back or moved behind a lamp. In later years Hitchcock wrote off the approach as misguided, andRopemay not be one of Hitchcock's top movies, but it's still a nail-biter. They don't call him the Master of Suspense for nothing.

{"description": "Like the Greenwich Village courtyard view from its titular portal, Alfred Hitchcock's classicRear Windowis both confined and multileveled: both its story and visual perspective are dictated by its protagonist's imprisonment in his apartment, convalescing in a wheelchair, from which both he and the audience observe the lives of his neighbors. Cheerful voyeurism, as well as the behavior glimpsed among the various tenants, affords a droll comic atmosphere that gradually darkens when he sees clues to what may be a murder.Photographer L.B. \"Jeff\" Jeffries (James Stewart) is, in fact, a voyeur by trade, a professional photographer sidelined by an accident while on assignment. His immersion in the human drama (and comedy) visible from his window is a by-product of boredom, underlined by the disapproval of his girlfriend, Lisa (Grace Kelly), and a wisecracking visiting nurse (Thelma Ritter). Yet when the invalid wife of Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr) disappears, Jeff enlists the two women to help him to determine whether she's really left town, as Thorwald insists, or been murdered.Hitchcock scholar Donald Spoto convincingly argues that the crime at the center of this mystery is the MacGuffin--a mere pretext--in a film that's more interested in the implications of Jeff's sentinel perspective. We actually learn more about the lives of the other neighbors (given generic names by Jeff, even as he's drawn into their lives) he, and we, watch undetected than we do the putative murderer and his victim. Jeff's evident fear of intimacy and commitment with the elegant, adoring Lisa provides the other vital thread to the script, one woven not only into the couple's own relationship, but reflected and even commented upon through the various neighbors' lives.At minimum, Hitchcock's skill at making us accomplices to Jeff's spying, coupled with an ingenious escalation of suspense as the teasingly vague evidence coalesces into ominous proof, deliver a superb thriller spiked with droll humor, right up to its nail-biting, nightmarish climax. At deeper levels, however,Rear Windowplumbs issues of moral responsibility and emotional honesty, while offering further proof (were any needed) of the director's brilliance as a visual storyteller.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790743213", "0783221347", "6304039530", "6300181340", "0783235593", "6300183580", "6300215741", "6301798503", "0783235607", "6305123616", "0792839846", "0783222955", "B0002IXSVI", "630150528X", "6301647734", "6304429274", "B0000040EO", "6302797667", "1558807780", "0783235704", "0792837614", "0783236352", "0783235623", "6301734734", "0790743159", "6305576173", "6304359705", "0783235682", "B00005A06N", "6304119097", "630266232X", "6301964012", "6300181529", "630233683X", "6301670159", "B00000F13T", "6301977084", "6301976061", "0792837649", "6303494390", "0782008348", "6300215512", "6305282927", "B00001OWYM", "B00005N5S2", "6303215734", "6300215717", "B000005PPB", "0783235674", "6305012792", "6304196954", "0800132009", "6302241103", "0792841859", "6304071876", "6302909023", "B00AEFXD1O", "B00000F3QZ", "6301607929", "6301978110", "B0087ZG7PW", "6300267865", "0800113055", "B000006N70", "B0045HCJ9E", "0782006809", "B00007JME0", "0780614097", "6301670140", "0792110269", "B000021Y6M", "6300269477", "0783235615", "6302413435", "6301798740", "0792837096", "6303854311", "B00005Q4GY", "0792107683", "0792837630", "6302800897", "6304457316", "0792835573", "6301978552", "B00000JKNL", "6303637574", "6305222754", "6302360978", "B00000JZIH", "6301797957", "6301975987", "1558800034", "6304359675", "6300271781", "630197350X", "6303364772", "6300216365", "6301800974", "0783227264"], "bought_together": ["0783221347", "6300183580"], "also_viewed": ["B0087ZG7PW", "B0045HCJ9E", "B0002HOEQ2", "B002GSXKQA", "B000A1INJE", "B000055Y0X", "B0087ZG7UW", "B001D8W7EU", "B00KMAVPW0", "B00J2R3VZI", "B008D1Q1VU", "B0045HCJHG", "B006FE83UE", "B00AEBB89C", "B003LMPKSQ", "B0045HCJQW", "B007N5YJWK", "0792839846", "B0002HOERG", "0790743213", "B000CCW2TS", "B000LP6KNU", "B000ECX0S8", "6304119046", "B00004XPPC", "B0010YSD7W", "B00AEBB97S", "B001D8W7EK", "B000ECX0O2", "6304429274", "B00I3C1T34", "6304039530", "630266232X", "0800132009", "6304039522", "B003VS0CX8", "0783235593", "B002VWNIAY", "6300183211", "B00BWJQEC6", "B0087F7VSY", "B002VWNIDG", "B00CNW9ZI6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 203666}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.18, "brand": "", "asin": "6300183513", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518BC0WC70L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rear Window [VHS]"}

{"description": "The movie that made \"No wire hangers!\" a household phrase,Mommie Dearestis the very model of a modern \"camp classic,\" so crazily outlandish that it's fascinating. Based on the scathing and scandalous tell-all bestseller by Christina Crawford, the adopted daughter of histrionic Hollywood movie queen Joan Crawford,Mommie Dearestwas billed in advance as a serious dramatic motion-picture biography. But it turned out to be something much, much weirder--a genuine Hollywood oddity that serves up a bizarre mixture of melodramatic trash and outrageous tragi-comedy. Joan Crawford won an Oscar for playing the role of the self-sacrificing mother, the woman who would do anything for her daughter, inMildred Pierce. As depicted by Faye Dunaway (playing the hell out of the role as if she's determined to win another Oscar of her own, damn it!), her role as offscreen parent puts her in a league with big-time scary screen mommies such as Mrs. Bates inPsycho, and Angela Lansbury's &uuml;ber-mom inThe Manchurian Candidate. Dunaway's Crawford torments and terrorizes her adopted children in myriad ways--making them give away their own birthday gifts and rousting them from their beds for frantic after-midnight bathroom-scrubbing attacks. And when, after the death of her Pepsico chairman husband, Crawford tells the board of directors, \"Don't f--- with me, fellas!\" one is very much inclined to heed her warning.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301706587", "6301977963", "B004LWZW4M", "B000005XPV", "6304359721", "6301973410", "B000003KE0", "B00005RERY"], "bought_together": ["6301977963"], "also_viewed": ["0767903579"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 304567}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.67, "brand": "", "asin": "6300213919", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N957ZKB0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mommie Dearest [VHS]"}

{"description": "When Samuel (Lukas Haas), a young Amish boy traveling with his mother Rachel (Kelly McGillis), witnesses the murder of a police officer in a public restroom, he and his mother become the temporary wards of John Book (Harrison Ford), a detective who's been assigned to solve the crime. After suspect lineups and mug-shot books yield nothing, Samuel, in the most memorable scene of the film, recognizes the murderer as a narcotics agent whose picture he sees in the precinct. Once Book realizes that the police chief is in on it, too, he whisks Samuel and Rachel back home to Amish country, where he himself goes into hiding as a plain Amish man. The juxtaposition between the life of the Amish and the violence of inner-city police corruption work surprisingly well for the story, and Kelly McGillis as the falling in love widow gives an almost perfect performance. Directed by Peter Weir, the film is extremely successful in drawing the viewer into its world and, accordingly, is immensely entertaining. The only thing that mars its polish is the one-dimensional, almost cartoonish handling of the upper-echelon police corruption--a subtler, more realistic treatment of this aspect of the story would have rendered the film near perfect.--James McGrath", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792116887", "B000007OY0", "6304259131", "0800125762", "6302816629", "6302238331", "6302935148", "0792133153", "6303269834", "B00000JS61", "080018789X", "630442972X", "B000003KDG", "0790743213", "6302415853", "6304071876", "079284517X", "B00005PJ8I", "6303402348", "0790748169", "6303057225", "6303637574", "6301599896", "6303942830", "B0000068ZQ", "6303020089", "6300181340", "0783235607", "6303402070", "B00007E2F6", "0790734079", "6300182479", "B00000J2L7", "6301734734", "079212569X", "6301736362", "6302909023", "0800116917", "6305126062", "6302226899", "6303696813", "6300247112", "0783226152", "B00000F5PI", "6305426678", "B000006N70", "0800132009", "6303058981", "6305012792", "B003MG6FJY", "6301976924", "5559477621", "B00005A1VH", "0783231482", "6303451462", "B000063UUP", "0792107683", "0800123506", "6304458975", "6303109950", "0790733935", "6304214502", "0792838556"], "bought_together": ["0792116887", "6302816629"], "also_viewed": ["6302380588"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 257292}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6300214567", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JAT9P45FL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Witness [VHS]"}

{"description": "During World War II, Hollywood's patriotic duty was to shoot stirring dramas and good-hearted comedies that celebrated America's brave soldiers and honored their loyal, virtuous wives and girlfriends. Which goes a long way toward explaining why this delirious Preston Sturges farce, filmed in 1943 at the height of the war effort (and of its director's powers), was delayed for a year while Paramount executives wrestled with Sturges's irreverence: inMorgan's Creek, the writer-director tweaked those stereotypes with his tale of Trudy Kockenlocker, a small-town girl who only wants to send our boys off with a smile. That she does, but she wakes up after an all-night party with vague memories of a dubious wedding and soon finds herself pregnant.Trudy, played by the ebullient Betty Hutton, is wholesome, sexy, and something of a ditz, in contrast to Sturges's usual savvy heroines (represented instead by Trudy's teenaged younger sister, played by Diana Lynn). Trudy's savior is would-be boyfriend Norval, played to apoplectic perfection by the rubber-faced Eddie Bracken, who was never better than in this wide-eyed, pratfall-happy performance as the weary but loyal draft reject who stands by his girl. As Trudy's father, Sturges regular William Demarest likewise achieves a series of comic peaks as the exasperated and increasingly desperate Officer Kockenlocker.Like Sturges's other Bracken-Demarest vehicle, the equally fineHail, the Conquering Hero,The Miracle of Morgan's Creekwas unique among wartime movies for its satirical sting and unblinking eye for hypocrisy on the home front. It's also enormous fun, a comedic romp that epitomizes Sturges's kinetic, high-speed style.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009ALSFW", "B00011D1KY", "6302011019", "6303360041", "6303364705", "6302682606"], "bought_together": ["B000HT3Q2S"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 303966}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.56, "brand": "", "asin": "6300215490", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5135XD674GL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Miracle of Morgan's Creek [VHS]"}

{"description": "Back when the  firstStar Trekfeature was released in December 1979, theTrekfranchise was still relatively modest, consisting of the original TV series, an animated cartoon series from 1973-74, and a burgeoning fan network around the world. Series creator Gene Roddenberry had conceived a second TV series, but after the success ofStar Warsthe project was upgraded into this lavish feature film, which reunited the original series cast aboard a beautifully redesigned starship U.S.S.Enterprise. Under the direction of Robert Wise (best known forWest Side Story), the film proved to be a mixed blessing forTrekfans, who heatedly debated its merits; but it was, of course, a phenomenal hit. Capt. Kirk (William Shatner) leads his crew into the vast structures surrounding V'Ger, an all-powerful being that is cutting a destructive course through Starfleet space. With his new First Officer (Stephen Collins), the bald and beautiful Lieutenant Ilia (played by the late Persis Khambatta) and his returning veteran crew, Kirk must decipher the secret of V'Ger's true purpose and restore the safety of the galaxy. The story is rather overblown and derivative of plots from the original series, and avid Trekkies greeted the film's bland costumes with derisive laughter. But as a feast for the eyes, this is an adventure worthy of big-screen trekkin'. Douglas Trumbull's visual effects are astonishing, and Jerry Goldmith's score is regarded as one of the prolific composer's very best (with its main theme later used forStar Trek: The Next Generation). And, fortunately forStar Trekfans, the expanded 143-minute version (originally shown for the film's network TV premiere) is generally considered an improvement over the original theatrical release.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300214400", "6300213803", "6301543408", "6303202004", "630021463X", "6303909949", "B0000AUHOH", "B00008OSD3", "6301792734", "6305587159", "6300182304", "B0000A36J1", "B000065U6Q", "6304415346", "6305365121", "630336568X", "0671830880", "6300214060", "6304935811", "6302380588", "6303651488"], "bought_together": ["6300213803", "6300214400"], "also_viewed": ["6300213803", "6301543408", "B00DB97LRC", "6300214400", "630021463X", "B00BAXTYIA", "B00005JLRT", "6303202004", "B00DB97LCM", "B00000ILBK", "B002I9Z8DK", "B0000AUHOH", "B002I9Z8B2", "6304415346", "6304539258", "B000USUA8Y", "B002I9Z8CG", "B0095XPZBC", "B002I9Z8GW", "B001TH16DI", "B0083TUEHY", "B00HETWFVC", "630273486X", "B000HEWEJ4", "6303909949", "6300213668"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 278050}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.79, "brand": "", "asin": "6300216802", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4164CYFHC6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek - The Motion Picture [VHS]"}

{"description": "AfterThe Exorcistsparked a lengthy trend of supernatural thrillers, this 1976 horror film scored a hit with critics and audiences for mixing gothic horror and mystery into its plot about a young boy suspected of being the personification of the anti-Christ. (No doubt it's a favorite of shock-rocker  Marilyn Manson.) Directed by Richard Donner (best known for hisSupermanandLethal Weaponfilms),The Omengained a lot of credibility from the casting of Gregory Peck and Lee Remick as a distinguished American couple living in England, whose young son Damien bears \"the mark of the beast.\" Mysterious deaths and unexplained incidents draw the attention of a photographer (David Warner), whose investigation leads to the young boy--and also to the photographer's shocking decapitation (in a scene that has since been inducted into the horror hall of fame). At a time when graphic gore had yet to dominate the horror genre, this film used its violence discreetly and to great effect, and the mood of dread and potential death is masterfully maintained. It's all a bit hokey, with a lot of biblical portent and sensational fury, but few would deny it's highly entertaining.  Jerry Goldsmith's Oscar-winning score works wonders to enhance the movie's creepy atmosphere.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300247147", "6300267881", "B00004TS0H", "6304508611", "0792846303", "6300247333", "B00096S48U", "0792836634", "B00005B238"], "bought_together": ["6300247147"], "also_viewed": ["6300247147", "B000AMW2TK", "6300247333"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 237731}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.9, "brand": "", "asin": "6300247104", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41QZ2BFBRFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Omen [VHS]"}

{"description": "When it comes down to naming the best Western of all time, the list usually narrows to three completely different pictures: John Ford'sThe Searchers, Howard Hawks'sRed River, and Hawks'sRio Bravo. About the only thing they all have in common is that they all star John Wayne. But whileThe Searchersis an epic quest for revenge andRed Riveris a sweeping cattle-drive drama (\"Take 'em to Missouri! Yeeee-hah!\"),Rio Bravois on a much more modest scale. Basically, it comes down to Sheriff John T. Chance (Wayne), his sobering-up alcoholic friend Dude (Dean Martin), the hotshot new kid Colorado (Ricky Nelson), and deputy-sidekick Stumpy (Walter Brennan), sittin' around in the town jail, drinkin' black cofee, shootin' the breeze, and occasionally, singin' a song. Hawks--who, like his pal Ernest Hemingway, lived by the code of \"grace under pressure\"--said he madeRio Bravoas a rebuke toHigh Noon, in which sheriff Gary Cooper begged for townspeople to help him. So, Hawks made Wayne's Sheriff Chance a consummate professional--he may be getting old and fat, but he knows how to do his job, and he doesn't want amateurs getting mixed up in his business; they could get hurt. This most entertaining of movies also achieved some notoriety in the '90s when Quentin Tarantino (director ofPulp Fiction,Reservoir Dogs, andJackie Brown) revealed that he uses it as a litmus test for prospective girlfriends. Oh, and if the configuration of characters sounds familiar, it should: Hawks remadeRio Bravotwo more times--asEl Doradoin 1967, with Wayne, Robert Mitchum, and James Caan; and asRio Loboin 1970, with Wayne, Jack Elam, and Christopher Mitchum.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792110188", "6301802330", "6300267938", "6304457308", "0792106989", "630197705X", "6300268799", "6300181588", "6301798090", "B000GX4476", "0792107128", "6304457316", "6304457278", "B000051S3Z", "6300183041", "0782008348", "0792105907", "6302320496", "6303471730", "B0018PH3L0", "B001E419N8", "B0000TANUI", "6301797922", "6301805518", "6300215733", "6300988473", "6301736362", "630150528X", "0790743213", "6303192254", "6300269884", "1555265952", "6301325508", "6300269043", "6303109950", "0792108868", "6304414099", "6304429711", "6302862906", "6303402070", "B00000I1DI", "6300216500", "0792838556", "6305237115", "B000GX7MMA", "6302990076", "B000056BRF", "630281622X", "6303101267", "0790727382", "6301976983", "6302032245", "6304286961", "6304071876"], "bought_together": ["0792110188", "6301802330"], "also_viewed": ["B000051S3Z"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 277544}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.89, "brand": "", "asin": "6300268470", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5127ECYB5EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rio Bravo [VHS]"}

{"description": "An earlier Elia Kazan film, the 1949Pinky, now seems dated because its \"scandalous\" subject, miscegenation, has become a social nonissue. If anything, the reputation of this legendary 1956 romp about a child bride in the Deep South has shifted the other way; the ripe image of Carol Baker as a mentally challenged nymphet who sucks her thumb as she lures grown men into her crib (an actual crib!) would probably be hounded off the screen today. When it was originally released the film won a \"condemned\" rating from the Catholic Legion of Decency, but it isn't as explicit as that might suggest. Current audiences are likely to be shocked not by what's actually shown, but by the mere fact that the movie is a comedy, in effect a sex farce, adapted by Tennessee Williams from a couple of his raunchier one-act plays.

{"description": "1900is one of Bernardo Bertolucci's adventures in epic filmmaking that never found the reception he had hoped for. Originally more than six hours long, it was chopped down to four hours for its U.S. release and as a result looked, well, choppy. Eventually, he restored it to five hours--but one wonders at all the effort on behalf of this alternately muddled and stunning story. The film, with a decidedly socialist agenda, examines two lives that begin the same year in rural Italy: the weak-willed son of the aristocracy (Robert De Niro) and the hardy, courageous son of peasants (Gerard Depardieu). They grow up as best friends on the same estate, until class differences pull them apart and then the era's fascist politics divide them for good. Despite strong performances by both leads, as well as Sterling Hayden, Donald Sutherland, Dominique Sanda, and Burt Lancaster, this one is strictly for Bertolucci's most avid fans.--Marshall Fine", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 446090}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 28.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6301015320", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/317FADHB9AL.gif", "title": "1900 [VHS]"}

{"description": "Director Francis Ford Coppola and executive producer George Lucas shared a strong desire to film the story of Preston Tucker, the man who revolutionized car design in the late 1940s, only to have his innovation squelched by the \"big three\" automakers in a legal battle between Tucker and powerful political lobbies. Coppola surely related to and sympathized with Tucker as a visionary underdog, and so this stylish, energetic film envisions \"the man and his dream\" in idealistic terms--an unabashed optimist (played by Jeff Bridges) who realizes his vision through blind faith and tenacity. Martin Landau gives a superb, heartbreaking performance as an associate who desperately wants to share Tucker's enthusiasm, but knows that corporate wolves are knocking at the door and will soon burst in with fangs bared. Joan Allen is equally good as Tucker's supportive wife, and the film's combination of dazzling costumes, production design, and the fabulous Tucker itself (of which only 50 models were made) creates an infectious atmosphere of postwar optimism. In the end, however, this fascinating film is much like Coppola himself: possessed of genius, blinded by ambition, and prone to create works of erratic brilliance. Don't take that as criticism, however; this is a sharp, underrated film about a dreamer whose dream was a worthy one, even if it only briefly came true.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300246965", "B00097E6V8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 334350}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.97, "brand": "", "asin": "6301217861", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N963ZG7HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tucker--The Man and His Dream [VHS]"}

Blustery commander MacChesney (Victor McLaglen) schemes to keep Ballantine in the army while his second in command, the treasure-hunting Cutter (Cary Grant in a hopelessly mugging comic performance), continues searching for his elusive mother lode, but all their plans are thrown into chaos when the rise of the bloodthirsty Thugs threaten Britannia's soldiers. Sam Jaffe takes up the rear guard in turban, loin, and full-body make-up as the titular Gunga Din, the loyal water carrier who dreams of becoming a soldier.

{"description": "Movie critic Roger Ebert summed it up very succinctly: \"Of all of theStar Trekmovies, this is the worst.\" Subsequent films in the popular series have done nothing to disprove this opinion; we can be grateful that they've all been significantly better since this film was released in 1989. After Leonard Nimoy scored hits withStar Trek IIIandIV, William Shatner used his contractual clout (and bruised ego) to assume directorial duties on this mission, in which a rebellious Vulcan (Laurence Luckinbill) kidnaps Federation officials in his overzealous quest for the supreme source of creation. That's right, you heard it correctly:Star Trek Vis about a crazy Vulcan's search for God. By the time Kirk, Spock, and their Federation cohorts are taken to the Great Barrier of the galaxy, this journey to \"the final future\" has gone from an embarrassing prologue to an absurd conclusion, with a lot of creaky plotting in between. Of course, die-hard Trekkies will still allow this movie into their video collections; but they'll only watch it when nobody else is looking. After this humbling experience, Shatner wisely relinquished the director's chair toStar Trek II's Nicholas Meyer.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303202004", "6300213803", "6300214400", "630021463X", "6300216802", "6305587159", "B00AZMFJYA", "6304415346", "6303909949", "B002HWRYJE", "B00008OSD3"], "bought_together": ["6303202004", "6300213803"], "also_viewed": ["6303202004", "6300213803", "6300216802", "630021463X", "6300214400", "6304415346", "630273486X", "6303148352", "6305750750", "6303909949", "B000ECVAVW", "B00BAXTYIA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 156122}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.98, "brand": "", "asin": "6301543408", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41GWP1HQJ9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek V - The Final Frontier [VHS]"}
{"description": "Part coming-of-age chronicle, part road movie,Carnyis memorablefor Jodie Foster's sexy, intelligent heroine and the pivotal influence of costar, cowriter, and producer Robbie Robertson. As principal songwriter and guitarist in The Band, Robertson had already been accorded the stature of rockauteurby some critics; when director Martin Scorsese captured the musician's laconic sex appeal and deep, mesmerizing speaking voice on celluloid forThe Last Waltz, the seed was planted for the Canadian rocker to graduate from documentary to dramatic feature.The lurid, colorful carnival milieu also dovetails with Robertson's Band legacy as songwriter, and his penchant for crafting picaresque story lines with a vivid sense of place. Robertson is Patch, a carny veteran whose de facto partner is the leering, cruel Frankie (Gary Busey), an abusive clown, and the film lingers on the tawdry and menacing world behind the carny's garish public spaces. When the young, self-confident Donna (Foster) shows up and joins the troupe, the bonds between Patch and Frankie are strained. Donna's walk on the wild side brings her in intimate, sometimes dangerous proximity to the freaks and lowlifes that populate this world, which the writers and director Robert Kaylor savor for its atmosphere of outsider surrealism.Foster acquits herself wonderfully, making this a revealing step between the prematurely hardened nymphet ofTaxi Driverand the actress's first truly adult roles, soon to follow. Busey and Robertson fare less well, their work long on mannerism but ultimately cryptic to a fault. Like the movie itself, they transmit a cynicism that seems hollow without more real insight into how they came to inhabit this netherworld, and why they can't escape it.--Sam Sutherland", "price": 15.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 383832}, "asin": "6301648846", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q7N3490HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Carny [VHS]"}
{"description": "Reviled by critics and embraced by the public during its initial run (1981),Porky'sis interesting to watch after all these years. What holds up about this horny coming-of-age tale is remarkable. Writer/director Bob Clark has little more than sex and practical joking on his mind, and his high school seniors from Angel Beach, Florida, rapidly move from one to the other. Clark displays a sense of timing and, perhaps rarer still, a sense of male friendship--its brutalities and its bonds--that feels right, not artificial. Surprisingly, the showcase practical jokes are still funny: the Everglades encounter with Cherry Forever, the hole in the girls' shower, and Beulah Balbricker, the humongous gym teacher. The comedic set-ups and payoffs surprisingly still work. Clark's insistence on a subplot about anti-Semitism, however, still sticks out as A MESSAGE. Kim Cattrall really got her start here (although almost no one else did) as Ms. Honeywell, a.k.a. \"Lassie.\" Clark later distanced himself from the irritatingPorky'ssequels and went on to make the wonderfulChristmas Story, the tale of a little boy who wants a BB gun for Christmas.--Keith Simanton", "related": {"bought_together": ["630240424X"], "also_viewed": ["B000O76ZNU", "B000056BSE", "B004INAKS2", "630240424X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 396986}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.24, "brand": "", "asin": "6301697286", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41AXZEWVH2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Porky's [VHS]"}

This time, chemistry is virtually all they have in a veritable rehash of the first film. What plot there is has to do with Nolte's needing Murphy (who is just out of jail) to help him clear his own name and save his job on the police force.

{"description": "Among the most exciting of MGM swashbucklers, Richard Thorpe's 1952Ivanhoestars Robert Taylor as the medieval hero of Sir Walter Scott's novel. Returning to England from the Third Crusades, Ivanhoe is steadfast in his determination to raise the ransom for the captured King Richard (Norman Wooland), but the effort is full of peril. First is Ivanhoe's reunion with his estranged father (Finlay Currie), a Saxon who hates the Norman king and refuses to give his son the money. Then there's Ivanhoe's unpopular rescue of a wealthy Jew, Isaac (Felix Aylmer), from anti-Semites, and the subsequent decision by Isaac's beautiful daughter, Rebecca (Elizabeth Taylor), to pay Ivanhoe's entry fee in a tournament. (The strapped knight seeks the tourney's cash prize.) Wait, it gets worse: two of Ivanhoe's closest associates (played by George Sanders and Robert Douglas) collude with Richard's evil brother, Prince John (Guy Rolfe), to discredit their friend and steal away Rebecca and another woman, Rowena (Joan Fontaine)--who also fancies Ivanhoe--for themselves. Yes, the situation looks grim, but surprise appearances by a couple of legendary hero types toward the end help level the playing field. Nonstop adventure to make one swoon,Ivanhoeis a gorgeous treat and reasonably faithful to the Age of Chivalry.

{"description": "Sidney Lumet's directorial debut remains a tense, atmospheric (though slightly manipulative and stagy) courtroom thriller, in which the viewer never sees a trial and the only action is verbal. As he does in his later corruption commentaries such asSerpicoorQ & A, Lumet focuses on the lonely one-man battles of a protagonist whose ethics alienate him from the rest of jaded society. As the film opens, the seemingly open-and-shut trial of a young Puerto Rican accused of murdering his father with a knife has just concluded and the 12-man jury retires to their microscopic, sweltering quarters to decide the verdict. When the votes are counted, 11 men rule guilty, while one--played by Henry Fonda, again typecast as another liberal, truth-seeking hero--doubts the obvious. Stressing the idea of \"reasonable doubt,\" Fonda slowly chips away at the jury, who represent a microcosm of white, male society--exposing the prejudices and preconceptions that directly influence the other jurors' snap judgments. The tight script by Reginald Rose (based on his own teleplay) presents each juror vividly using detailed soliloquies, all which are expertly performed by the film's flawless cast.

Irons won an Oscar for his spooky, knowing performance, which hints at depths of degeneracy without ever putting a dent in a veneer of bored elegance. The contrast between the hard-charging Dershowitz and his eager-beaver Harvard law students and the eternally languid von B&uuml;low adds unexpected humor.--Marshall Fine", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 203795}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6302033020", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Y6YM1XFTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Reversal of Fortune [VHS]"}

{"description": "With Michael Curtiz (Casablanca) as director, Cary Grant in the  lead, and wall-to-wall songs by Cole Porter, how couldNight and Daylose? Why, by taking broad liberties with the composer's life story and failing to live up to expectations. If you can overlook such shortcomings, however, it's lively entertainment that doesn't completely deserve the scorn it has elicited. Grant is good as a bon vivant who had a way with words but lacked the discipline to pursue a career in law. As a singer, on the other hand, he's merely adequate. Curtiz wisely has the fine supporting actresses (Jane Wyman, Ginny Simms, etc.) handle the big numbers such  as \"You're the Top.\" Also, Porter's story was meant for black and white.

{"description": "An unbelievable movie, and deliriously better for it. Keanu Reeves is a  hotshot law enforcement dude--Johnny Utah by name--investigating a series of  bank robberies in L.A. Four gunmen, disguised in rubber masks of ex-U.S.  presidents, have never come close to being caught, but veteran agent Gary Busey  has a theory: The bandits are surfers. This prompts the superb line, \"The ex-presidents rip off banks to finance the endless summer!\" This movie's full of  dialogue like that, but instead of sounding ridiculous it creates its own  infectious comic-book energy--ride the crest of it and you'll find the film's  giddy zone. Patrick Swayze plays Bodhi, zen-master leader of the surfing clan,  humming serenely with the wisdom of the waves. (Alarmingly, Swayze also did his  own skydiving stunts.) Director Kathryn Bigelow (Strange Days) stages the  action sequences with a visceral snap, and clearly has a gift for orchestrating  pulp fiction. Though not a huge hit when was first released,Point Breakhas a well-deserved cult reputation thanks to its video afterlife.

After blowing his fortune, Sarto attempts to reclaim his old job, which his former lieutenant (Bogart) isn't about to give up. Taken for the proverbial ride, Little John escapes and finds shelter among the Floracians, a monastic order devoted to \"beautifying the lives of men with flowers.\" Thus is \"Brother Orchid\" set on the path to spiritual rebirth--after settling some old business, of course. Robinson agreed to make this gangland comedy if Warners let him star in a pair of historical biopics,Dr. Ehrlich's Magic BulletandA Dispatch from Reuter's--his own pursuit of class, perhaps. It was a good deal all around.

In his final completed film (he died of a heart attack less than a year later), Tyrone Power plays the prime suspect in the murder of a wealthy widow, and Marlene Dietrich plays the wife of the accused, whose testimony--and true identity--holds the key to solving the case. A classic of courtroom suspense,Witness for the Prosecutionis one of those movies with enough double-crossing twists to keep the viewer guessing right up to the very end, when yet another surprise is deftly revealed. This being a Billy Wilder film, the dialogue is first-rate and the acting superb, with both Laughton and his offscreen wife Elsa Lanchester (playing the barrister's pesty nurse) winning Academy Awards for their performances.

{"description": "This 1991 comedy by Gabriele Salvatores was knocked for not  being deep enough, but it is what it is, and it's actually an easygoing, sunny  movie about eight Italian soldiers who manage to strand themselves on a tiny Greek island paradise during World War II. The sort of mutts who would shoot  a donkey for not knowing the proper password, these clumsy warriors  become a comic variation on the Lotus Eaters of myth, their fighting spirit evaporated in the midst of so much beauty and sexual availability among the local women. There are also sundry opportunities for the men to find another purpose  for their lives (one particularly artistic fellow works on the restoration  of a church, for example). Amid the sometimes coarse jokes and gratuitous nudity, there are subtle themes about the contrast between what men are truly like in their natural state versus what they are like as killers. (The Thin  Red Linethis isn't, but Salvatores does, in his own way, touch on some of the same themes.)

But Nicholson gets swept up in the blarney of his charismatic older brother, even as he suffers gnawing doubts about the way Big Bro treats his lady friends (including Ellen Burstyn).

Lee careens from the hedonistic ebullience of Malcolm's early days to the stark despair of prison, from his life-changing conversion to Islam to his emergence as a dynamic political leader--all with an epic sweep and vitality that illuminates personal details as well as political ideology.

{"description": "One of Humphrey Bogart's finest performances dominates this unusual 1950 film noir, which focuses less on the murder mystery at the center of its plot than on the investigation's devastating effect on a fragile romance. For Bogart, already a noir icon, the Andrew Solt script afforded an opportunity to explore a more complex and contradictory role--an antiheroic persona in line with the actor's most accomplished and absorbing triumphs throughout his career.For maverick director Nicholas Ray, the film posed the challenge of taking crime dramas beyond their usual formulas and into a more mature realm, as well as a chance to cast a jaundiced eye on the film industry itself. Its protagonist is Dixon Steele, a Hollywood screenwriter with an acerbic wit and a violent temper. Tasked with adapting a bestseller, he meets a hatcheck girl who's read the book, hoping to glean its highlights before writing the script. When she's found murdered, Steele becomes the prime suspect, and a tightening knot of suspicion forms around the writer.Steele's only, inconclusive witness is a pretty new neighbor, Laurel (Gloria Grahame), and the couple fall in love even as the pressure mounts. At first the new relationship is a tonic to the hard-boiled writer, who plunges into his script with a renewed vigor and discipline. But as the police continue to shadow him, Steele's own penchant for violence erupts against friends, strangers, and even Laurel herself, whose feelings are increasingly eclipsed by suspicion that her lover is a murderer, and fear that he'll harm her.Bogart conveys Steele's world-weariness and underlying vulnerability, and manages the delicate task of making both his romantic yearning and sudden, murderous rages equally convincing. Ultimately, that performance and Grahame's sympathetic work elevateIn a Lonely Placeinto what has been called \"an existential love story\" more than a crime drama.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000068EE", "6304056869", "6302413435", "B000BWIZRW", "6301978110", "0790743159", "6303364772", "B0007ZEO8C", "6302375827", "6302226899", "6304039522", "6304212151", "1558807780", "B001BZQMFA", "6302120446", "6301968948", "6304212135", "079074886X", "0783217528", "0790746387", "6300208249", "6302952581", "6301491920", "6301564456", "6302797675", "0790743531", "6301966430", "0783217390", "6302700949", "B00000493Q", "6300183912", "6302305942", "6301005740", "6301640667", "6302753198", "0783236352", "630292300X", "6302305950", "6302281849", "630150528X", "6303120474", "6303128890", "630196697X", "0792837096", "6302800897", "6302797519", "6304119038"], "bought_together": ["B000BWIZRW"]}, "price": 14.9, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 298317}, "asin": "6302801133", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510CFAB9KDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "In a Lonely Place [VHS]"}
{"description": "Hammer Studios' greatest nemeses, Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, once again square off in this reworking of Universal'sThe Mummy(with elements ofThe Mummy's TombandThe Mummy's Ghostthrown in for good measure). Cushing stars as archeologist John Banning, whose dig for a lost tomb results in untold treasures but leaves his father a mumbling madman and marks the rest of the company for death. Lee is Kharis, a former high priest turned gauze-wrapped guardian of the tomb, a veritable Golem sent on a mission of vengeance by Mehemet Bey (George Pastell), a disciple of the ancient Egyptian god Osiris. The scenes at the archeological dig and the flashbacks to the ancient burial are stagebound and cheap looking, but Terence Fisher is back in familiar territory when the action relocates to the misty swamps and Victorian mansions of rural England. The towering, 6-foot-3-inch-tall Lee makes the most terrifying mummy to date. He covers ground in giant strides, smashes his way into rooms with heavy Frankensteinlike swipes of his arm, and takes shotgun blasts with barely a twitch--yet he melts from rage to calm at the sight of Banning's wife, Isobel (Yvonne Furneaux), a dead ringer for his dead Queen.

{"description": "Best known for light, entertaining musicals such asSingin' in the Rain, director Stanley Donen grew more adventurous (and less successful) in the latter stages of his career, but this edgy romantic comedy from 1967 has proven to be one of Donen's best, most enduring films. Jumping back in forth in time, the film chronicles the marital ups and downs of a stylish British couple (Albert Finney and Audrey Hepburn) as they travel on various vacations over the course of their 12-year marriage. The separate vignettes combine to form a collage of joys and pains as the young couple struggles to maintain their fading marital bliss. In this regard, the film is refreshingly sophisticated in its treatment of the difficulties of long-term commitment, and with Hepburn and Finney in the leads, great performances are drawn from the acerbic wit of Frederick Raphael's screenplay. Fashion mavens will also marvel at Hepburn's astonishing wardrobe of late-'60s fashion--she's a showcase for summer couture, looking fantastic in everything from candy-striped bellbottoms to hip sunglasses and outrageously stylish hats. Some of the melodrama clashes with forced comedy (such as tiresome running gags or a cartoonish portrayal of crass American tourists), but that doesn't stopTwo for the Roadfrom being timelessly appealing and truthful to the challenge of lasting love.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303631851", "6300215598", "6304457383", "6302636779", "6300251152", "6301967119", "6300215717", "6304178352", "6300215814", "6301586026", "6305282927", "6301647734", "6301969316"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 157950}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.3, "brand": "", "asin": "6302878527", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517MTS1S2VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Two for the Road [VHS]"}

{"description": "Consistently cited by critics worldwide as one of the greatest films ever made, Jean Renoir's bittersweet drama of life, love, class, and the social code of manners and behavior (\"the rules of the game\") is a savage critique undertaken with sensitivity and compassion. Renoir's catch-phrase through the film, \"Everyone has their reasons,\" develops a multilayered meaning by the conclusion. A young aviator (Roland Toutain) commits a serious social faux pas by alluding to an affair on national radio. To avert a scandal, the cultured Robert de la Chesnaye (Marcel Dalio), husband to the aviator's mistress, Christine (Nora Gregor), and a philanderer in his own right, invites all to a weekend hunting party in his country mansion. The complicated maze of marriages and mistresses (social register and servant class alike) is plotted like a bedroom farce, but the tone soon takes a darker cast. Renoir, who also takes the pivotal role as Andre's jovial pal and de la Chesnaye confidant Octave, deftly blends high comedy with cutting satire as he parallels the upstairs-downstairs affairs. The film builds to a comic pitch with the hilarious performance of Julien Carette as a rabbit poacher turned groundskeeper, but soon turns tragic in a devastating conclusion. The film was roundly condemned and banned in France upon its 1939 release, but years later (out of the shadow of WWII) the film was rediscovered for the masterpiece that it is.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 412283}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "The Rules of the Game [VHS]", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304628188"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JT64E0AAL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "6302969301"}

In the troupe, a mime (Jean-Louis Barrault) falls in love with an actress in the company, but must vie for her affections with others, including a thief, an actor, and an influential count. When the actress is accused of theft, the mime exonerates her with a bravura performance for the prefect.  Eventually, though, the actress must flee Paris under protection of the count after being mixed up in a crime with the thief, leaving the smitten mime heartbroken. In the intervening years, both become involved with others, the actress with the count and the mime with the daughter of the theater owner, eventually having a child. Both couples are unhappy, and although the mime rises above the poverty-stricken neighborhood where he has honed his trade and becomes wildly successful, he still pines away for the love of his life. Eventually the two lovers are meant to meet again, but their storybook ending may yet elude them.

Director Alfonso Arau (A Walk in the Clouds), adapting a novel by his former wife, Laura Esquivel, tells the story of a young woman (Lumi Cavazos) who learns to suppress her passions under the eye of a stern mother, but channels them into her cooking. The result is a steady stream of cuisine so delicious as to be an almost erotic experience for those lucky enough to have a bite. The film's quotient of magic realism feels a little stock, but the story line is good and Arau's affinity for the sensuality of food (and of nature) is sublime.

Blue is the most somber of the three, a movie dominated by feelings of grief. As the film begins, a car accident claims the life of a well-known composer. His wife, played by Juliette Binoche (Oscar winner forThe English Patient), does not so much put the pieces of her life back together as start an entirely new existence. She moves to Paris, where she dissolves into a wordless life virtually without other people. Kieslowski attaches an almost subconscious significance to the color blue, but primarily he focuses on Binoche's luminous face, and the way her subtle shifts in emotion flicker and disappear. The picture may be more enigmatic than the follow-upsWhiteandRed, but Binoche's quiet, heartbreaking presence becomes spellbinding; her performance won the best actress prize at the Venice Film Festival in 1993.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303326838", "6303486762", "6302508754"], "bought_together": ["6303326838", "6303486762"], "also_viewed": ["B005HK13T0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 467897}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6303160344", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518273SKGYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blue [VHS]"}

{"description": "Richard Donner's 1978 epic about the Man of Steel showed how a film about a superhero could be a moving and romantic experience even for people who long ago gave up comic books. Beginning on the icy planet Krypton, the story follows the baby Kal-El, whose rocket ship lands in Smallville, Kansas. He is found there by a childless couple and raised as the shy Clark Kent (the young Kent is played by Jeff East). The film is perhaps most touching in these sequences, with expanses of wheat fields blowing in the wind and with a young man who can't figure out what part in destiny his great powers are meant to play. The second half, with Reeve taking over as Clark/Superman, is bustling, enchanting (the scene in which Superman flies girlfriend Lois Lane--played by Margot Kidder--through the night sky is great date material), and funny, thanks largely to Gene Hackman's sardonic portrayal of nemesis Lex Luthor.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300268993", "B000059XYC", "6300270122", "6303020089", "B000059XXZ", "0784011923", "B0002XNSYA", "B00005A1VG", "6303506291", "6301969413", "0800198395", "6302941318", "6304509154", "630196649X", "6304508611", "0790731975", "0790700506", "6300181537", "B000059XY5", "0790733897", "B00000JGEI", "6300214311", "6304047843", "6302238331", "6300214060", "630407185X", "6303148352", "6303212379", "6302510023", "0783216084", "B00004TYS8", "6302380294", "0790744589", "0792133153", "6302091632", "6302098424", "6304143184", "B0000068SI", "B00004RNAC", "6302510031", "630251018X", "6302510015", "B0000CDL3W", "6302510198", "B0001VL30O", "B000006FNX", "6302909023", "B000065U6Q", "6302032377"], "bought_together": ["6300268993", "B000059XYC"], "also_viewed": ["B000IJ79WU", "6300268993", "B000059Z8K", "B000P6XQ50", "B0039208JE", "6300270122", "B000IJ79VQ", "B000059XYC", "B000IJ79X4", "B001DJLD2G", "B000059XXZ", "B00F4FFO8E", "B00005JKCH", "6302642248", "6303953425", "B00005LIRF", "B00EAPMGIU", "B000IJ79XE", "B00BBND56G", "0790734079", "0784011923", "B000VI70QS", "B00005LKLF", "B000059Z8L", "B000UR9T8C", "B00005JXY3", "B0039208QM", "6303506291", "B0016MOWOQ", "B0087F7VSY", "B00000GUNY", "0783222726", "B00DYEN6XC", "B00E5I2MCM", "B0090SI582", "B00JPS6A3O", "B0057R5XRG", "B008JFUO72", "B008JFUS0U"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 202304}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6303212263", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51E39PXF9BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Superman the Movie [VHS]"}

{"description": "Edward D. Wood Jr. was an actor writer-director-producer, occasionally in drag, who combined meager bursts of talent with an undying optimism to create some of the most bizarrely memorable \"B\" movies to ever come out of Tinseltown. Though Wood died in obscurity as an alcoholic in 1978, his films have been considered cult classics for years. He is consistently voted the worst director who ever lived. You would think this an odd subject, but director Tim Burton harnesses the undying hopefulness that made Wood such a character. Shot in black and white, just like Wood's creations, this stylized, witty production captures the poetic absurdity of Wood's films and his unconventional life. Burton's recreation of Wood's wonderfully awfulPlan 9 from Outer Spacelooks much better than the original low-budget quickie. Burton tackled an extremely strange subject matter for a biopic, but Wood is presented as naive almost to the point of delusion, so the story works. The pace sags in the middle, as the weirdness starts to wear thin, but Depp proves himself an adroit actor, even while wearing angora and a blonde wig. Wood's unconventional repertoire company is faithfully reproduced, including an Academy Award-winning Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi. Landau is pathetic, droll, and charismatic as the elderly junkie who made his last screen appearances in Wood's films.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301763041", "0800187873"], "bought_together": ["6301763041"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 314635}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.87, "brand": "", "asin": "6303407188", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F97RJE9XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ed Wood [VHS]"}

After a solid hour or so of the two traveling on this quest through Idaho and Italy, Van Sant throws a wrench into the works by conjuring a gay version of Shakespeare'sHenry IV, Part I, with Reeves's character as Prince Hal and filmmaker William Richert (who directed Phoenix in the 1988Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon) as a variation on Falstaff.

{"description": "Brian De Palma's 1981 thriller is something of a homage to Michelangelo Antonioni's masterfulBlowup, though there are hints of Francis Ford Coppola's paranoia-inducingConversationsprinkled throughout. John Travolta plays a sound-effects man who witnesses what appears to be a tragic car accident killing a presidential candidate. The audio tape he happened to be recording at that moment (adding to his collection of natural sounds), however, suggests but doesn't prove that a murderous conspiracy is afoot. Trying to tease a shred of evidence from murky doubt, Travolta's character turns to a hooker (Nancy Allen) for help and stumbles into a web of evil spun by a right-wing kook (John Lithgow). De Palma's fetishistic fascination with obscured truth in a universe ruled by chance makesBlow Outone of his most operatic films. It's also perhaps one of his most revealing about the inherent decadence of creating verisimilitude for art.

{"description": "The wordBarakameans \"blessing\" in several languages; watching  this film, the viewer is blessed with a dazzling barrage of images that  transcend language. Filmed in 24 countries and set to an ever-changing globalsoundtrack, the movie draws some  surprising connections between various peoples and the spaces they inhabit,  whether that space is a lonely mountaintop or a crowded cigarette factory. Some  of these attempts at connection are more successful than others: for instance,  an early sequence segues between the daily devotions of Tibetan monks, Orthodox  Jews, and whirling dervishes, finding more similarity among these rituals than  one might expect. And there are other amazing moments, as when sped-up footage  of a busy Hong Kong intersection reveals a beautiful symmetry to urban life that  could only be appreciated from the perspective of film. The lack of context is  occasionally frustrating--not knowing where a section was filmed, or the meaning  of the ritual taking place--and some of the transitions are puzzling. However,  the DVD includes a short behind-the-scenes featurette in which cinematographer  Ron Fricke (Koyaanisqatsi) explains that the effect was intentional:  \"It's not where you are that's important, it's what's there.\" And what's here,  inBaraka, is a whole world summed up in 104 minutes.--Larisa Lomacky  Moore", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 435282}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 17.99, "brand": "", "asin": "630349255X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/212T1M480ZL.jpg", "title": "Baraka [VHS]"}

The year is 1936, and Stalin's purges are in full swing. Despite his reputation and revolutionary record, Sergei Kotov (Mikhalkov) seems to be on the dictator's hit list, as indicated by the insulting arrival of his wife's former lover, an agent of government police. Mikhalkov treats all this as a matter of personal and political intrigue dropping like rotting fruit in the middle of a sunny and loving period for the Kotov clan. The director ingeniously understates the mounting threat until one begins to realize that the Kotovs are only geographically distant from the long, bloody reach of Stalin. By the time we do realize it, the shock of change is almost unbearable.

{"description": "Legendary 1950s-60s B-Movie Horror Director Roger Corman filmed this 1959 Horror Classic with the tag-line \"A beautiful woman by day - a lusting Queen wasp by night\". The film is a real hoot, great camp-fun with actress Susan Cabot as the aging owner of a famous cosmetic firm, who turns to a crackpot scientist for everlasting beauty. A natural answer, don't we all turn a scientist when we see a wrinkle now & then. Well, of course this wasn't a good decision on her part, the scientist apparently got his degree from the \"Mad-Scientist School\". The enzymes from the Queen wasps that the scientist used at first gives her great beauty but soon the nature of the Queen wasp comes to the surface and she is totally distorted with a giant Wasp-head (not what the cover shows which was the movie poster). Desperately she realizes that the only way to keep her beauty is to protect her serum, she turns to violence and death at night as the wasp woman. Of course, this was supposed to be a serious horror film but if you don't out right laugh over the \"cheeseiness\" of this 50s film something is wrong.

{"description": "Americans love the underdog. Anytime someone is beating the odds, fighting his or her way to the top, like the Little Engine That Could, it resonates well with U.S. audiences; it's in their nature. Sylvester Stallone knew that in 1976, whenRockywas a monstrous hit and established itself in the American cultural lexicon. His low-budget tale of a young boxer who came from the slums of Philadelphia and worked his way to the championship recalls Capra characters such as Mr. Smith or John Doe as he worked his way to fame and self-respect. Like Capra's films from 30 years before,Rockypushed emotional buttons with audiences, but in a somewhat less maudlin, obvious way; it's possible to enjoyRockywithout feeling embarrassed about it, even in the cynical, postironic '90s. It ranks respectably among the best boxing pictures, such asThe Set-UporSomebody Up There Likes Me. The story paralleled Stallone's own, from a relative unknown to a star with one breakthrough picture.Rocky II(1979) carries on the story line, playing on the rivalry between Rocky Balboa and nemesis Apollo Creed, while Balboa's wife fights for her life. Mainly, though, the sequel seems like a link between the first film andRocky III, in which an aging Rocky takes on big, bad Clubber Lang (the near-forgotten Mr. T). While playing on the same emotional capital as the first movie,Rocky IIIis the high-water mark of the sequels; by the next movie, Stallone had turned into a near-self-parody of the original character.Rocky IVfinds the underdog taking on an oversized, blond Russian boxer (Dolph Lundgren) in a cold war scenario (Rocky literally wraps himself in the American flag). The series mercifully played out by 1990, as embarrassingly punch-drunk as the Rocky character himself by that point. Given the way the American pop-culture continuum seems to work, it's probably due time for the later sequels to be plucked from the compost heap of '80s flotsam and revived as high camp; the Reagan-era hyperpatriotism ofRocky IVis as dated as in junk likeRed Dawnor the dreadfulInvasion U.S.A. Still, the first three films pack a satisfying emotional wallop without giving the viewer the urge to crawl under the couch. The last two... well, use your judgment. They will soon be good for an '80s nostalgia party.--Jerry Renshaw", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000N4SHPS", "B000067CZY", "0766202771", "6302610702", "0792158261", "B00006AL1C", "6302824729", "B000005QWI", "6301792734", "6303909884", "6300183211", "B0000A36J1", "B0001VL30O", "6303953425", "B00000490M", "B000065U6Q", "0784011923", "B000006FKX", "6303824382", "0790734516", "6303651461", "0790705141", "B000007PI9", "6301589025", "6302816580", "6301520106", "0800198395"], "bought_together": ["B000N4SHPS"], "also_viewed": ["B0006GAO5Y", "B00HF98SJY", "6302610702", "B00006AL1C", "6301792734", "6304007523", "B000059Z8K", "5554454593", "6302822688", "B0000039LV", "6300213005", "0780627032", "B00BBND56G", "0792158261", "B0065AW3TA", "B000067CZY", "0792152808", "B000005PFL", "B002GSXKN8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 289290}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6304007647", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513RKAM629L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rocky Gift Set [VHS]"}
{"description": "John Frankenheimer scored his first success with this, his third theatrical feature and his second collaboration with producer-star Burt Lancaster (they would make five films together all told). Lancaster delivers an angry, brooding performance as real-life criminal Robert Stroud, a violent killer who, while in solitary confinement, became an internationally recognized authority on birds and their diseases. Based on the book by Thomas E. Gaddis, Frankenheimer creates a portrait of a withdrawn, antisocial prisoner who discovers his own potential after reluctantly rescuing a wounded sparrow from a storm and nursing it back to health. Lancaster's quiet portrayal comes from his eyes and restrained body language, earning him his second Oscar nomination. Costars Telly Savalas (as the talkative \"neighbor\" from the cell next door) and Thelma Ritter (as his controlling mother) were also nominated, but Frankenheimer's sensitive direction draws equally fine performances from Neville Brand, playing against type as the prison guard who slowly befriends Stroud, and Karl Malden as the tough warden whose ideas of confinement and punishment prompted Stroud to follow-up his studies of birds with a treatise on prison reform. This somber, subdued tale offers no truly happy ending, but it does present a powerful portrait of one man's efforts to earn back his dignity and respect in the worst of conditions.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301973259", "1558807780", "0790743531", "B000M5BRX2", "6302909023", "6301797957", "6301967410", "0790743213", "6301973410", "6302413435", "630196733X", "6301976061", "6302226899", "0783222955", "6301976932", "6301798503", "6304039530", "6301975987", "0790733935", "6304196911", "B000005XPV"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 391087}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.97, "brand": "", "asin": "6304111363", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EM12HWZ5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Birdman of Alcatraz [VHS]"}

Leslie Nielsen, who has made a fortune starring in most of these intermittently inspired spoof movies, plays a secret agent whose code name is WD-40 and whose supervillain nemesis is the armless General Rancor (Andy Griffith). As the battle rages and the sight gags fly (the entrance to a hospital and sanctuary for nuns reads \"Our Lady of the Never-Had-the-Pickle Convent\"), WD-40 is aided by the beautiful spy 3.14 (Nicolette Sheridan). As always in these things, there are plenty of parodying references to other movies (Pulp Fiction) and tons of cameos (Fabio, Dr. Joyce Brothers, and such). The funniest stuff takes place in the first few minutes as \"Weird Al\" Yankovic sings the title song.

{"description": "When a slightly cross-eyed Siamese cat named D.C. (Darn Cat) turns up  with a wristwatch around his  neck instead of a collar, it could be just the clue the FBI needs to  crack a series of bank robberies in this lightweight comedy from  Disney.  The watch belongs to a bank teller who  has been taken hostage.  Dean Jones stars as the good-hearted FBI agent  assigned to the case.  Unfortunately, he is highly allergic to, you guessed  it, cats.  Hayley Mills is D.C.'s doting owner who hatches a hair-brained  scheme to follow D.C.'s every move until he returns to the crooks' hideout  where he got the wristwatch.  After a lot of sneezing, slapstick, and comedic intrigue, the bank robbers are foiled, the hostage is safe, and everyone is  happy. An impressive supporting cast of Frank Gorshin, Elsa Lanchester,  Roddy McDowall, and Ed Wynn add to the zaniness. Released in 1965 (and remade in 1997), it is understandably dated, but the performances are fun  nonetheless.  Hayley Mills is delightful as the determined and unflappable  wannabe sleuth, and Dean Jones proves he is adept at physical comedy. This is a movie of little consequence, just a clean, fun diversion that the  whole family can watch. The theme song is sung by Bobby Darin.--Peggy Maltby-Etra", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301727630", "6304675143", "6302271991", "0788811207", "B00005RRG5", "B0000022WA", "6304500718", "0788806661", "0788810987", "B00005RRG6", "0788806734", "6304368534", "6302961572", "0788811266", "6301390725", "155890641X", "B0001I55OW", "6302271967", "0788806742", "6302320402", "078881172X", "B00005RRG3", "B0001HAFIO", "6302126169", "0788811428", "078881141X", "6304500726", "B00000I0V5", "6304675151", "B00006472N", "630440123X", "0788811436", "6301708156", "B000006212", "6304293925", "6302426200", "6301991311", "B00000ICHA", "6301708288", "B000055ZJP", "6300274586", "6303854311", "6303494390", "6304029284"], "bought_together": ["6301727630", "6304675143"], "also_viewed": ["B00005RRG5", "6304400551", "B00004R99N", "6303036813", "B00005RRG3", "6304500831", "0788811207", "6303315305", "B00005RRG6", "6301390725", "6304290888", "B001KRCDSY", "0788806734", "B00000623Y", "6300275310", "6305177473", "B000009CTR", "6301727630", "6304311834", "B00005RRG9", "0788812181", "0788812408", "B000BUUL94", "6301991311", "6302320402", "6303534422", "B00005RDWC", "B0009X75QU", "B0000022WA", "6304155972", "6304089112"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 287676}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.5, "brand": "", "asin": "6304285388", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511HMK3J7RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "That Darn Cat!

{"description": "A little-known chapter of American labor history is brought vividly to life in this period drama from writer-director John Sayles. It's a fictional story about labor wars among West Virginia coal miners during the 1920's, but every detail is so right that the film has the unmistakable ring of truth. The tension begins when the Stone Mountain Coal Company of Matewan, West Virginia, announces a lower pay rate for miners, who respond by calling a strike under the leadership of a United Mine Workers representative (Chris Cooper). Proving strength in numbers, the miners are joined by black and Italian miners who initially resist the strike, and a fateful battle ensues when detectives hired by the coal company attempt to evict miners from company housing. Violence erupts in a sequence of astonishing, cathartic intensity, andMatewanachieves a rare degree of moral complexity combined with gut-wrenching tragedy. The film salutes a pacifist ideal while recognizing that personal and political convictions often must be defended with violence. To illustrate this point, Sayles enlisted master cinematographer Haskell Wexler, who creates the film's authentic visual texture--a triumph of artistry over limited resources. The result is a milestone of independent filmmaking, andMatewanremains one of Sayles's finest achievements.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000N2HDG4", "6301996135"], "bought_together": ["B00005KA73"]}, "price": 39.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 319456}, "asin": "6304383657", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519GJ691F1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Matewan [VHS]"}

Over the course of the film, Pacino alternately discusses the role and the text; roams Manhattan, talking about Shakespeare with everyone from scholars to people on the street; and re-creates scenes from the play in a production staged at the Cloisters, an evocative castle-like museum on the north end of Manhattan. He assembles a cast that includes Kevin Spacey, Winona Ryder, Estelle Parsons, and Alec Baldwin to perform the scenes, and he slips back and forth between text and discussion of the play in a way that makes Shakespeare comprehensible and fascinating to viewers who know or care nothing about his writing.--Marshall Fine", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 263742}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Looking for Richard [VHS]", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00DQN6IOK", "B00B1E6EAY", "B00ECR7KX2", "B0002TVWYW", "B004M9ZI0M", "B00B2BYY1W", "6301863240", "6305622892", "6304046006"], "also_viewed": ["B000A9QK50"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BNGXAGY7L._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "6304393075"}

{"description": "Halloweenis as pure and undiluted as its title.  In the small town of Haddonfield, Illinois, a teenage baby sitter  tries to survive a Halloween night of relentless terror, during which  a knife-wielding maniac goes after the town's hormonally charged  youths. Director John Carpenter takes this simple situation and  orchestrates a superbly mounted symphony of horrors. It's a movie much scarier for its dark spaces and ominous camera movements  than for its explicit bloodletting (which is actually minimal). Composed  by Carpenter himself, the movie's freaky music sets the tone; and his  script (cowritten with Debra Hill) is laced with references to other  horror pictures, especiallyPsycho. The baby sitter is played  by Jamie Lee Curtis, the real-life daughter ofPsychovictim  Janet Leigh; and the obsessed policeman played by Donald Pleasence  is named Sam Loomis, after John Gavin's character inPsycho.  In the end, though,Halloweenstands on its own as an  uncannily frightening experience--it's one of those movies that had  audiences literally jumping out of their seats and shouting at the  screen. (\"No! Don't drop that knife!\") Produced on a low budget,  the picture turned a monster profit, and spawned many sequels,  none of which approached the 1978 original. Curtis returned for two  more installments: 1981's dismalHalloween II, which picked  up the story the day after the unfortunate events, and 1998's occasionally  grippingHalloween H20, which proved the former baby sitter  was still haunted after 20 years.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005LC4Q", "B000FA57UI", "B000FA57US", "B000Q66Q2O", "B005CFC0N8", "B004P7CNUY", "B0000AOX09", "B004P7CM9Q", "B000VKL6Z2", "B00006LPHA", "B002XD0J80", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B001NPD9LS", "B002YICNE2", "B000GETUDI", "B000FS9FE4", "B001DJLD1W", "B00AEFY2LO", "B00006FI0R", "B00AEFY2WI", "B005CFBYW6", "B00006FDBT", "B00AEFY31S", "B00AEFY37C", "B00005K3NR", "B00004TS0G", "B003UGLCIA", "B0087ZG7UW", "B000I2J68M", "B000V4UFZK", "B0000VCZMK", "B0033B5XCS", "B000AM6OQ2", "B0002JP572", "B002VWNIDG", "B0058S0OMS", "B000099T3M", "B00AEFY1V0", "B002ZG971U", "B00AEFYYH6", "B00003CXCF", "B004LWZW2O", "B001B1UO6W", "B00006FDCD", "B000E1ZBIG", "B004SIP9MY", "B000TSIJWY", "B000WC3864", "B004AC6PMG", "B001DJLD0S", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B004P7CMT6", "B0002CHK1S", "B000FC2GA0", "B008CYDD7I", "B0008191WO", "B0024FADD8", "B0053TWVDC", "B00018D42W", "B00AEFY2AA", "B00DTPRZ24", "B000KJU1KK", "B00AEFY2E6", "B0000CEB6Y", "B0006SGYL0", "B00004Y87O", "B0013D8LAE", "B00005JA8B", "B006ZL1P66", "B000GBEWRU", "B000IMUYJM", "B005J9ZFQG", "B001JFZ1UE", "B007STBUHI", "B000E8M0P6", "6305972001", "B00079Z9WI", "B00005A8XX", "B00009PY4G", "B000FAOC2W", "B000AA4JL6", "B0002C4JJ4", "B0002O7XW2", "B008JFUNYG", "B000HEWEGC", "B002LMSWN2", "B00BM4Q4H6", "B000HCO86I", "B008874968", "0783227434", "B0006SSOHC", "B001JFZ122", "B004LWZW24", "B000Q66Q8I", "B00001QGUM", "B000OYCMLM", "B000PMLJMQ", "B00000ILDD", "B00A1AU72A", "B004SIP9E2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00KDU8HQQ", "B00005LC4Q", "B000VKL6Z2", "B002YICNE2"]}, "price": 19.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 349265}, "asin": "6304697961", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NXT68J3CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Halloween"}
{"description": "After starring in the now-legendary trilogy of spaghetti Westerns for Italian director Sergio Leone, Clint Eastwood became a box-office star and imported the style of those classic shoot-'em-ups for this 1967 Western directed by Ted Post, with whom Eastwood had worked during their days on the television seriesRawhide. Eastwood plays an innocent rancher who is mistaken for a cattle rustler and sentenced to hang by an angry mob. When he is saved from the noose by a passing lawman, he embarks on a renegade campaign of vengeance against the men who attempted to lynch him.Hang 'Em Highoffers a number of memorable moments and stylistic flourishes, and features a superb supporting cast of Western veterans, including Ben Johnson, Ed Begley, Pat Hingle, Dennis Hopper, Bruce Dern, L.Q. Jones, and the &quot;Skipper&quot; himself, Alan Hale Jr. Made just three years beforeDirty Harry, the film marked a turning point for Eastwood, who would soon move into a prolific period of contemporary thrillers.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000N3SSBW", "B003ASLJRC", "B003ASLJS6", "0783225725", "B00000K0DM", "0792839056", "B003AWRMCE", "0783228007", "B00008CMT4", "6304698798", "0792842502", "B003ASLJNQ", "B00AEFXVOI", "B00388PK7O", "B004FPXMDI", "B001M9ELQ2", "B003ASLJKE", "B0001FVDJQ", "B003AWRMA6", "B003AWRM9W", "B003AWRMCY", "B0015XHQT4", "B003DZAM8Y", "B003AWRMBU", "B003AT9CJ8", "B003AWRMC4", "B00AEFYSEA", "B003ASLJMM", "B000055Y0Y", "B00AEBBA0E", "B003ASLJMW", "B002M9WW3A", "B0014CKCCY", "B003ASLJIQ", "B001FZQOW2", "B003AWRMBA", "B0045HCJTO", "B0014VPFT0", "B003ASLJPE", "B00AEFYTEY", "B000059TFW", "B003ASLJOU", "B002Z7FWBI", "B000O599YE", "B000E5N6LG", "B003ASLJJU", "B00005LC4R", "6304711905", "B003ASLJO0", "0767817710", "B00AEFXUL2", "B003AWRMCO", "0783227930", "B00009N83V", "078322592X", "B0045HCJSK", "B000059TFU", "B0007TKNM4", "B004AOECXI", "0792845838", "B000O59A0C", "B0007MAO0C", "B0015XHQU8", "B0082LUFA4", "B000O599Y4", "B00008CMR6", "B003ASLJRW", "B00008MTW5", "B00AEFYL6K", "B00AEFXRG0", "B000OPOANO", "B000O599NK", "B0015XHQUI", "B00AEFYPHA", "B000XR9L50", "B00008CMR4", "B0000TANUI", "B000ANVPP6", "0783228031", "B001EGRD3G", "B00008IHAW", "B003AT9D74", "B007Y1NR1W", "B000O599ZS", "B00AEBB8YM", "B000W1SZBS", "B003AWRM9M", "0783230346", "6305245487", "B0015XHQTY", "B00AEBB932", "B000O599NA", "B000ANVPPQ", "B000O599WQ", "B000H5U69I", "B00083FZFY", "B000NQRR34", "B007RG9LMS", "0792838408"], "bought_together": ["B003ASLJRC", "B000N3SSBW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003ASLJRC", "0792842502", "B003ASLJS6", "0783225725"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10287}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.35, "brand": "EASTWOOD,CLINT", "asin": "6304698801", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P0255N43L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hang 'Em High"}

Certainly this film (directed by French stylist Jean-Pierre Jeunet) is an improvement overAlien&nbsp;3, with a script that breathes exciting new life into the franchise. This chapter is set even further in the future, where scientists on a space colony have cloned both the alien and Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), who died inAlien&nbsp;3; in doing so, however, they've mixed alien DNA with Ripley's human chromosomes, which gives Ripley surprising power (and a bad attitude). A band of smugglers comes aboard only to discover  the new race of aliens--and when the multi-mouthed melonheads get loose, no place is safe. But, on the plus side, they have Ripley as a guide to help them get out. Winona Ryder is on hand as the smugglers' most unlikely crew member (with a secret of her own), but this one is Sigourney's all the way.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000ILE6", "6302561868", "6302822688", "B002ZG98LO", "630303201X", "B0000633ZP", "6304304161", "078322530X", "6304259158", "B00005JLTM", "6300247171", "B000AA4FII", "0800178394", "6304559976", "6302900522", "B00005JKWI", "B0001VL30O", "6301963725", "079284078X", "B00000JGEK", "B00003CXXR", "0792836677", "0784011923", "B00005B238", "6302158176"], "bought_together": ["6302561868"], "also_viewed": ["6302561868", "B001AQO3QA", "6300247171", "5554454593"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 280343}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.87, "brand": "", "asin": "6304844948", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/714DEV2T9BL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Alien Resurrection [VHS]"}
{"description": "When Jane's husband disembarks from a passenger train immediately after their wedding and disappears without a trace, troubling questions are raised. How could his face, mangled beyond recognition in a plane crash during the war, have healed without any scarring? And what unspeakable acts took place on the alligator-ridden bayou plantation he left as an address? Wonderfully haunted,The Alligator Peopleexplores the mystery with skillful pacing, generally decent dialogue, and only intermittently laughable special effects. Miscegenation, anxiety over radiation and atomic science, homoeroticism, distrust of doctors and medicine, fear of the American South--all the major cultural obsessions of the late '50s are either tacitly or explicitly represented here; perhaps that's why the far-fetched scientific premise that underlies the plot makes a weird resonance despite its utter implausibility. The ubiquitous Lon Chaney is on hand, and his performance as a drunken swamp rat with a penchant for violence is a hoot; but the real star of the show is Beverly Garland, whose inspired lead, alternately detached and histrionic, decidedly puts to rest the myth of the inelasticity of early sci-fi and horror performers.

{"description": "A brazen mixture of stand-up comedy, political commentary, CEO confrontations, and shenanigans with Random House tour escorts, Michael Moore's second foray into dark docucomedy afterRoger and Mefollows his Midwest book tour to promoteDownsize This. One of his Milwaukee tour escorts explains that medium-sized cities in the Midwest tend not to attract tours by the self-important celebrities of the Coasts; instead, they attract \"more thoughtful authors like Michael.\" His kind of thoughtfulness evokes both laughter at, and disgust with, corporate America. To be sure, there is a certain naivet&eacute;  in Moore's proworker take on corporate and political America--his half-serious plan for a Nike shoe factory in Flint, Michigan, makes as much business sense as coal mining on Maui--but he gives voice to well-reasoned arguments that have most easily gotten lost amid the Clinton-era boom's corporate downsizing and reliance on \"temporary\" employees.In cities like Des Moines, Minneapolis, St. Louis, and Portland,The Big Onejuxtaposes both Moore's lighthearted-sounding but deeply biting humor speaking before bookstore patrons and painful-to-watch confrontations with security personnel at companies such as Procter & Gamble and PayDay. (For future targets of Moore's style of journalism, take note of Nike CEO Phil Knight's fairly effective approach as Moore calls him to task on Nike's Indonesian labor.)

{"description": "Max Oph&uuml;ls explores the scandalous life of dancer and courtesan Lola Montes with a bittersweet empathy that turns melodrama into a tragic melancholy masterpiece. Using the theatrical re-creation of Lola's life in a big-top pageant as a framing device, Oph&uuml;ls contrasts the outrageous sensationalism of her reputation with poignant, poetic flashbacks that explore her many affairs, most notably with Franz Liszt (Will Quadflieg) and King Ludwig of Bavaria (Anton Walbrook). Lola's greatest tragedy is that she loved well, if not too wisely. If Martine Carol's central performance is lacking passion, as many critics have argued, her quiet, at times seemingly passive demeanor makes her a veritable prisoner of her society and her reputation. Swept along by Oph&uuml;ls's sweeping camerawork, which glides through the film in a balance of intimacy and contemplative remove as if on the wings of angels, her life becomes like a cinematic ballet with Oph&uuml;ls the choreographer and conductor. Peter Ustinov costars as the jaded circus ringmaster, who nightly narrates her exploits to a throng of scandal-hungry spectators, while she performs with a face hardened in indifference, resigned to her empty role as a figure of spectacle in a garish gilded cage.  Shot in delicate color and impeccably composed widescreen compositions throughout by Oph&uuml;ls's regular cinematographer Christian Matras,Lola Montesis his most beautiful and restrained film, a fitting swan song for one of the cinema's most sensitive directors.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001BEK8BK", "B001BEK8C4", "B001BEK8BU", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B008NNSDSC", "B00DZP1BUU", "B00005A8TW", "B000093NR0", "B008Y5OVZ8", "B00HE011DE", "B000NOK0H6", "B00HE010QM", "B008NNSDBY", "B00005JKGX", "B004WPYO7E", "B003ICZW7I", "B008CJ0JS4", "B00005AUK9", "B004A30AW6", "B000BC8SWO", "B00023P4GA", "B005KQVE1S", "B00D9BNONW", "B00GPPXNIK", "B008Y5OXB0", "B00005BCK0", "B0012Z361M", "B000B8384Q", "B00HRJVHEK", "B000XQ4HQO", "B00007CVS2", "B00IGK6TGU", "B008CJ0JPW", "B001BSBBDK", "B00CEIOHPU", "B000067IY7", "B0000687DE", "B00CN70M60", "B00B2BYXSQ", "B003ZYU3U0", "B001D8W7EK", "B004CIIXDC", "B00005K3NV", "B000BGH2NG", "B0087ZG7R0", "B000ZM1MJG", "B00007L4I6", "B00005JKPT", "B001LMU19G", "B00CUKTGSA", "B00AQ6J64O", "0780022343", "B00003CXC9", "B005ND87UY", "B000Y14U5Q", "B000OPPADS", "B00D23GPH4", "B000A88EV4", "B0035ECHVI", "B00005UQ7R", "B00003CXBU", "B00005UQ7Q", "B00005QAPJ", "B0016B6ZEC", "B0002V7O0Q", "B0009WIE2K", "B00BSN0VZW", "B009RWRINE", "B0030H16W6", "B00BX49BGQ", "B00005A06N", "B0007989ZC", "B00B2BYY1M", "B005EXA8MS", "B00005JLV7", "B005HK13S6", "6305999872", "B00DZP1C9K", "B00064AEWY", "B0000A0DTV", "B00007CVS4", "B0006Z2NE0", "B000305ZYS", "B00005QW59", "B00006RCO1", "B000FFJYA2", "B00008H2GR", "B004P9UWM8", "B002E01MAG", "B001D8W7EU", "B00406UJZG", "B000094J75", "B00022LJ7O", "B000FFJYAW", "1572528060", "B000BR6QCS", "B000BT994S", "B0006Z2NB8", "B002TZS5GA", "B0000E69HD"], "bought_together": ["B001BEK8BK", "B001BEK8C4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001BEK8BK", "B001BEK8C4", "B008NNSDSC", "B001BEK8BU"]}, "price": 20.41, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 339791}, "asin": "630522885X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZKJHRE1HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lola Montes"}
{"description": "In the age of ever-increasing crassness on screen (see the Farrelly brothers' comedies), there are some filmmakers who can make serious commentary instead of just throwaway gags. Neil LaBute's second feature is a corkscrew comedy of savage, bitter people who can't find happiness in many a thing, let alone sex. The film is not as tight or commanding as his first feature, the black-heartedIn the Company of Men, but he gives six nameless characters six juicy parts with plenty to talk about. The emotional punch is devastating for those trying to find love and happiness on celluloid. One wife and husband (Amy Brenneman,Men's Aaron Eckhart) are nice people, living in a dream home, who can't connect sexually. Drama teacher Ben Stiller and live-in girlfriend Catherine Keener may just work out if, well, he didn't talk all the time. Stiller confesses his love for best friend Eckhart's wife; Keener starts an affair with artist assistant Nastassja Kinski. Then there's Jason Patric (who also produced) as a calculating, misogynistic doctor who has not had a peer on film or theater since David Mamet'sSexual Perversity in Chicago(which took a different film form asAbout Last Night...). Manipulative and forward, he's the white-hot core to LaBute's fire and has the monologue of the year to boot. LaBute's callous films aren't for everybody, but there is an art and clear-headedness to his work that most American independent filmmakers can't create on screen. Note: the six characters speak the only lines in the film, although through careful editing it never seems this way.--Doug Thomas", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 513356}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.87, "brand": "", "asin": "6305240027", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/01ZCVB671GL.jpg", "title": "Your Friends &amp; Neighbors [VHS]"}
{"description": "A little drunk on its own arcane exotica as a gambling movie,Roundersis a film that takes us inside a world of high-stakes card players but falls short on such essentials as character development, relationships, that sort of thing. Still, it is a real curiosity, written by a couple of guys (David Levien and Brian Koppelman) who appear to know something about the dark underbelly of card hustling for fun and profit. Matt Damon stars as a reluctant law student who can't put aside his subterranean career of playing poker and blackjack for big money. After he loses his post-grad nest egg to a weird Russian kingpin (John Malkovich)--and also loses his disgusted girlfriend (Gretchen Mol) in the process--Damon's character turns to an unreliable old buddy (Edward Norton) for a dangerous game of sharking wherever there happens to be a game underway: frat boys, cops, bad dudes, you name it. Norton appears to be living out every young actor's fantasy of re-creating Robert De Niro's prototypical head case in Martin Scorsese'sMean Streets, and while his performance is burdened by obvious quotation marks, his estimable talent still shines through. Damon's charm and intelligence bring some oomph to the curiously flat proceedings, and while his hushed, soul-bearing scenes with Martin Landau (as a law professor who takes a shine to the kid) seem gratuitous, they're still nice to watch. Behind all this is director John Dahl (Red Rock West), who is not exactly at the top of his game here but who brings his distinctive toughness to the crime-noir tone.--Tom Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 343634}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.18, "brand": "", "asin": "6305240655", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51565J9D9ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rounders [VHS]"}

The story of a girl for whom a bad stroke of luck is no match for her internal strength and purity of heart.

One of three daughters of a man (Jeroen Krabb&eacute;) who dies and leaves her fate in the hands of a conniving stepmother (Anjelica Huston), Danielle is cast into the lowly role of a servant. Meanwhile, her sisters are evaluated as possible mates for a French prince (Dougray Scott), but he's far more intrigued with Danielle's intelligence and beauty--not to mention her way with a sword and fist.

{"description": "Meet Dr. Michael Hfuhruhurr (Steve Martin), the famous brain surgeon. Perhaps the name is not unfamiliar, though it is unpronounceable; the good doctor is the inventor of the celebrated \"screw-top\" method of brain surgery, in which the top of the skull twists off as easily as the lid of a pickle jar. The man may be a medical genius, but his talent for love leaves something to be desired, which explains his marriage to a gold-digging vixen (Kathleen Turner). Ah, but Dr. Hfuhruhurr may yet find true love, in the form of the disembodied brain he discovers in the lab of a mad scientist--David Warner, gone the Frankenstein route. (Lovely image:  Hfuhruhurr in a rowboat, taking the brain out for a romantic ride on the lake.) Thus, in its own utterly goofy way, doesThe Man with Two Brainsdelve into the eternal dilemma of male indecision:  does a man fall in love with a woman's body, or with her mind? Along the way, of course, there are gags both highbrow and very, very lowbrow, a mind-body split that might be why critics have tended to prefer the more sophisticated slapstick ofAll of Me(directed, like this film, by Carl Reiner) andRoxanneamong the early Steve Martin outings. Still, this is one of Martin's funniest pictures, and a game Kathleen Turner, fresh off herBody Heatsuccess, ably spoofs her own sultry image.

{"description": "Filming a love story centered on two mentally challenged people is a touching idea, one that's been attempted in films such asBenny and Joonand even, to a certain extent,As Good As It Gets.The Other Sisteris another addition to the genre, a well- acted comedy-drama centering on the romance of Carla (Juliette Lewis) and Daniel (Giovani Ribisi) and throwing in some general family angst as a secondary story line. The acting is tremendous--Lewis and Ribisi both give convincing performances without condescending to their characters.  Diane Keaton plays yet another charming scatterbrain, this time as Elizabeth Tate, the uptight, rich mother who wants a picture-perfect life. But good acting isn't enough here.  These fine actors drown in a sea of mediocre writing, and we're left with a film with no real conflict or tension. Will Carla and Daniel make it work? Well, of course.  Will mother Elizabeth loosen up about her \"gay workaholic\" daughter and let Carla live her own life? Do you really need to ask? There are a few cringe-worthy moments that have a sense of truthfulness, such as when Daniel stands up at Carla's sister's wedding to announce his feelings.  But otherwise, these characters live in a pampered, fairy-tale world where the worst thing that happens to them is that the meanies at school put chewing gum in Daniel's bike helmet. Ultimately, this is a sweet, albeit occasionally saccharine, tale that will move those who are looking for cheerful fare.--Jenny Brown", "related": {"also_bought": ["630526886X"], "bought_together": ["B000066HAS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 310116}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6305492042", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71YYDDA0J8L._SY300_.gif", "title": "The Other Sister [VHS]"}
{"description": "Ever spend eight hours in a \"Productivity Bin\"? Ever had worries about layoffs? Ever had the urge to demolish a temperamental printer or fax machine? Ever had to endure a smarmy, condescending boss? ThenOffice Spaceshould hit pretty close to home for you. Peter (Ron Livingston) spends the day doing stupefyingly dull computer work in a cubicle. He goes home to an apartment sparsely furnished by IKEA and Target, then starts for a maddening commute to work again in the morning. His coworkers in the cube farm are an annoying lot, his boss is a snide, patronizing jerk, and his days are consumed with tedium. In desperation, he turns to career hypnotherapy, but when his hypno-induced relaxation takes hold, there's no shutting it off. Layoffs are in the air at his corporation, and with two coworkers (both of whom are slated for the chute) he devises a scheme to skim funds from company accounts. The scheme soon snowballs, however, throwing the three into a panic until the unexpected happens and saves the day. Director Mike Judge has come up with a spot-on look at work in corporate America circa 1999. With well-drawn characters and situations instantly familiar to the white-collar milieu, he captures the joylessness of many a cube denizen's work life to aT. Jennifer Aniston plays Peter's love interest, a waitress at Chotchkie's, a generic beer-and-burger joint &agrave; la Chili's, and Diedrich Bader (The Drew Carey Show) has a minor but hilarious turn as Peter's mustached, long-haired, drywall-installin' neighbor.--Jerry Renshaw", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008X5J3", "6304994540"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 339504}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.97, "brand": "", "asin": "6305499365", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/718J2JXRD9L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Office Space [VHS]"}
{"description": "There's Something About Maryis one of the funniest movies in years, recalling the days of the Zucker-Abraham-Zucker movies, in which (often tasteless) gags were piled on at a fierce rate. The difference is that cowriters and codirectors Bobby and Peter Farrelly have also crafted a credible story line and even tossed in some genuine emotional content.The Farrelly brothers' first two movies,Dumb and DumberandKingpin, had some moments of uproarious raunch, but were uneven. WithMary, they've created a consistently hilarious romantic comedy, made all the funnier by the fact that you know that they know that some of their gags go way over the line.Cameron Diaz stars as Mary, every guy's ideal. Ben Stiller plays a high-school suitor still hung up on Mary years later; the obstacles standing between him and her include a number of psychotic suitors, a miserable little pooch, and, oh yeah, a murder charge.The Farrellys' admittedly simplistic camera work, which adapts easily to a TV screen, and the fact that you'll likely laugh yourself so silly over certain scenes you'll want to replay them to see what you were missing while you were busy convulsing, make this a perfect video movie.--David Kronke", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300214567"], "also_viewed": ["B00004YZEG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 467528}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.01, "brand": "", "asin": "6305499071", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41T5QB162RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "There's Something About Mary (Special Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "Pixar genius reigns in this funny romantic comedy, which stars a robot who says absolutely nothing for a full 25 minutes yet somehow completely transfixes and endears himself to the audience within the first few minutes of the film. As the last robot left on earth, Wall-E (voiced by Ben Burtt) is one small robot--with a big, big heart--who holds the future of earth and mankind squarely in the palm of his metal hand. He's outlasted all the \"Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class\" robots that were assigned some 700 years ago to clean up the environmental mess that man made of earth while man vacationed aboard the luxury spaceship Axiom. Wall-E has dutifully gone about his job compacting trash, the extreme solitude broken only by his pet cockroach, but he's developed some oddly human habits and ideas. When the Axiom sends its regularly scheduled robotic EVE probe (Elissa Knight) to earth, Wall-E is instantly smitten and proceeds to try to impress EVE with his collection of human memorabilia. EVE's directive compels her to bring Wall-E's newly collected plant sprout to the captain of the Axiom and Wall-E follows in hot pursuit. Suddenly, the human world is turned upside down and the Captain (Jeff Garlin) joins forces with Wall-E and a cast of other misfit robots to lead the now lethargic people back home to earth. Wall-E is a great family film with the most impressive aspect being the depth of emotion conveyed by a simple robot--a machine typically considered devoid of emotion, but made so absolutely touching by the magic of Pixar animation. Also well-worth admiring are the sweeping views from space, the creative yet disturbing vision of what strange luxuries a future space vacation might offer, and the innovative use of trash in a future cityscape. Underneath the slapstick comedy and touching love story is a poignant message about the folly of human greed and its potential effects on earth and the entire human race.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000VBJEEG", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00007LVCM", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B00AFEX83C", "0736424229", "B00005JN4W", "B00005JNQS", "B0042U94UQ", "B00E9ZATJO", "B001OMU6UM", "B00005JNS0", "B0030IIZ4M", "B0034JKZ86", "B002ZG97YM", "B002WJI2QQ", "B004HO6I4M", "B008YWY0HK", "B0012EM5D8", "B0006UEVT0", "B009SZCC9U", "B004G600A4", "B00AAXFYPI", "B00F522C7C", "B008Z1LBU4", "B00CTNYLQA", "B003H9M1Q2", "B000AAF1TU", "B008JFUQ16", "B000ROAK2W", "B000AY74OG", "B00275EHJG", "B00CWM58WY", "B00009M9BK", "B00EV1YZ96", "B001DPHDCY", "B000MV9026", "B001O5LVPI", "0783231474", "B00CQRN3QI", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00I6JOD2S", "B001HN6922", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B0087F7VSY", "B001U2MQE0", "B0030IIYYS", "B00A83075M", "B00H4Z07Q6", "B005LAIH4A", "B000DWMYQ8", "B00CHVJODE", "B0000AOX0O", "B003UESJF6", "B00JK531ES", "B00HLTD2OE", "B0001I561E", "B00BGYO7HG", "B003ZHVJGO", "B001ILFUD2", "B0002YLCOM", "B0039N74CW", "B00004U9WQ", "B00937R6QC", "B00CUDD0C0", "B004EPZ034", "B00004R99S", "B00003CXB4", "B000065V42", "B00005RDSQ", "B004ZBACOE", "B001GCUO7A", "B00AO686JC", "B000AAF1U4", "B0006JMLRK", "B00005JMQZ", "B0043X1FOK", "B00C7JGDBW", "B001JRB17Y", "B001KVZ6G6", "B00005TN8K", "B00005JMFH", "B00E9ZATKI", "B001ILFUDC", "B000V1Y44G", "B00003CX8Y", "B0011U52E2", "B00EBBGLFC", "B000YERP2S", "B00009YXAW", "B00003CXCQ", "B002NZK5SW", "B000G75AZC", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B0084IHVGG", "B00947N6D8", "B004LWZW7Y"], "bought_together": ["B001KVZ6FW", "B000VBJEEG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004HO6I4M", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00I6JOD2S", "B00005JN4W"]}, "price": 17.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 319062}, "asin": "7883706837", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51u-jDIxUZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)"}
{"description": "The 1988 sequel to one of the most successful movies of all time finds Eddie Murphy reprising his role as Detroit police detective Axel Foley, and once again playing a fish out of water as he tries to solve a series of heists in Beverly Hills that may be connected to the attempted murder of his friend, a Beverly Hills police captain (Ronny Cox). Constructed in a much flashier and faster-paced visual style than the first film, the song still remains the same as Foley tries to keep his job in Detroit while solving crimes for the Beverly Hills cops. Murphy again makes the most of culture shock for comic effect, and the easy rapport between Murphy and Billy (Judge Reinhold), now a cheerfully over the topRambo-esque figure, is still the centerpiece of this series.

{"description": "Edward Scissorhandsachieves the nearly impossible feat of capturing the delicate flavor of a fable or fairy tale in a live-action movie. The story follows a young man named Edward (Johnny Depp), who was created by an inventor (Vincent Price, in one of his last roles) who died before he could give the poor creature a pair of human hands. Edward lives alone in a ruined Gothic castle that just happens to be perched above a pastel-colored suburb inhabited by breadwinning husbands and frustrated housewives straight out of the 1950s. One day, Peg (Dianne Wiest), the local Avon lady, comes calling. Finding Edward alone, she kindly invites him to come home with her, where she hopes to help him with his pasty complexion and those nasty nicks he's given himself with his razor-sharp fingers. Soon Edward's skill with topiary sculpture and hair design make him popular in the neighborhood--but the mood turns just as swiftly against the outsider when he starts to feel his own desires, particularly for Peg's daughter Kim (Winona Ryder). Most of director Tim Burton's movies (such asPee Wee's Big Adventure,Beetlejuice,Batman) are visual spectacles with elements of fantasy, butEdward Scissorhandsis more tender and personal than the others. Edward's wild black hair is much like Burton's, suggesting that the character represents the director's own feelings of estrangement and co-option. Johnny Depp, making his first successful leap from TV to film, captures Edward's childlike vulnerability even while his physical posture evokes horror icons like the vampire inNosferatuand the sleepwalker inThe Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. Classic horror films, at their heart, feel a deep sympathy for the monsters they portray; simply and affectingly,Edward Scissorhandslays that heart bare.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B001AGXEA6", "B008MU8ZM0", "B00AEBBA1I", "B00AEBB9V4", "B008UZBHYU", "B000I5XOWI", "B003UMW68Y", "B0065AO94W", "B001EZE5BU", "B008BSM1GO", "B008QE9VJI", "B0043EV774", "B00GR76W1Q", "B005LAIIA8", "B000M9BPEY", "B005DZ35RC", "B007NPKPN2", "B002UOMGZQ", "B00288KNJU", "B003M8NG94", "B004P29LEU", "B008U0XRD4", "B005DZ35TU", "B000JSI7B2", "B001O8DB1W", "B000NA22C6", "B002S6L6XY", "B000002OFD", "B004VLZUI6", "B0088EDMMS", "B005HARX4Y", "B004SIP7QC", "B001AQR3E4", "B00AJCUL2G", "B003L4Y5B2", "B0039208JE", "B0054QHHHE", "B002QEHPR4", "B0027VTMAE", "B001CO42MU", "B001AR4K8K", "B003UESJLK", "B001IKKMCW", "B000WUMLU0", "B006MOYH0M", "B00993FEUK", "B003ZHR6PW", "B00C888MJ8", "B001AQT0UY", "B00AEFXXFU", "B0039208QM", "B00164GDA0", "B005KQVDH8", "B001HN69B8", "B001D8W7CW", "B000WSLAUO", "B00005R87R", "B00FAI3JE6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001AGXEA6", "B008MU8ZM0", "B00AEBBA1I", "B008FD36IC"]}, "price": 8.5, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 449136}, "asin": "B000005QLO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511ADGQ59YL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Edward Scissorhands"}

{"description": "When Steven Spielberg was an adolescent, his first home movie was a backyard war film. When he toured Europe withDuelin his 20s, he saw old men crumble in front of headstones at Omaha Beach. That image became the opening scene ofSaving Private Ryan, his film of a mission following the D-day invasion that many have called the most realistic--and maybe the best--war film ever. With 1998 production standards, Spielberg has been able to create a stunning, unparalleled view of war as hell. We are at Omaha Beach as troops are slaughtered by Germans yet overcome the almost insurmountable odds.A stalwart Tom Hanks plays Captain Miller, a soldier's soldier, who takes a small band of troops behind enemy lines to retrieve a private whose three brothers have recently been killed in action. It's a public relations move for the Army, but it has historical precedent dating back to the Civil War. Some critics of the film have labeled the central characters stereotypes. If that is so, this movie gives stereotypes a good name: Tom Sizemore as the deft sergeant, Edward Burns as the hotheaded Private Reiben, Barry Pepper as the religious sniper, Adam Goldberg as the lone Jew, Vin Diesel as the oversize Private Caparzo, Giovanni Ribisi as the soulful medic, and Jeremy Davies, who as a meek corporal gives the film its most memorable performance.The movie is as heavy and realistic as Spielberg's Oscar-winningSchindler's List, but it's more kinetic. Spielberg and his ace technicians (the film won five Oscars: editing (Michael Kahn), cinematography (Janusz Kaminski), sound, sound effects, and directing) deliver battle sequences that wash over the eyes and hit the gut. The violence is extreme but never gratuitous. The final battle, a dizzying display of gusto, empathy, and chaos, leads to a profound repose.Saving Private Ryantouches us deeper thanSchindlerbecause it succinctly links the past with how we should feel today. It's the film Spielberg was destined to make.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006C7G9", "6303168507", "6303057225", "B00AEBBA36", "6302529441", "0800125762", "6304935811", "B00003CXTF", "B000EHSVS2", "0790734060", "6303257844", "6302415853", "B0007TKNGA", "6301247345", "6301662954", "0790734079", "6302610702", "6302909023", "630407185X", "0783221347", "079213690X", "0800132009", "0790701251", "6305363668", "6301115430", "0790752395", "6304071876", "6300268748"], "bought_together": ["B00006C7G9"], "also_viewed": ["0792151712", "6301792734", "0792837614", "B00003CXXO", "6303109950", "6304117752", "6303402348", "6303168507", "B00003CXTF", "B000RC7QVC", "0783221347", "078323662X", "630018627X", "6304151306", "0783230095", "6304233639", "B0000040EJ", "6303187064"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 269908}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.5, "brand": "", "asin": "B00000K3AM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4143F912CXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Saving Private Ryan [VHS]"}

{"description": "So who exactly was Deep Throat, that all-important source who helped Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein bust open the Watergate scandal? Well, according to this thoroughly funny, keenly smart comedy from director Andrew Fleming (The Craft), it was two sweetly daft teenage girls named Betsy and Arlene. Taking the history and figures from Watergate and running gleefully and sacrilegiously amok,Dickoffers up a hilarious what-if scenario that takes the Nixon administration's downfall from grave tragedy to hilarious farce. When Betsy (Kirsten Dunst) and Arlene (Michelle Williams) run into a shady figure in the stairwell of Arlene's Watergate apartment building, little do they know they've stumbled upon G.&nbsp;Gordon Liddy (Harry Shearer) on the night of the Democratic National Headquarters break-in. Later, on a White House field trip, they wind up meeting with Nixon himself (Dan Hedaya), who, to ensure their silence, decides to make them official White House dog walkers and \"secret youth advisors.\" Of course, Betsy and Arlene soon find out their idol has feet of clay, and ultimately decide to aid \"radical muckraking journalists\" (and queasy rivals) Woodward (Will Ferrell) and Bernstein (Bruce McCullough) in their investigation. Fleming and cowriter Sheryl Longin's enfolding of the Watergate scandal is extremely clever and inspired, from Arlene's 18-and-a-half-minute declaration of love on Nixon's tape recorder to the Hello Dolly cookies (laced with a certain herbal stimulant) that help bring about the U.S.-Soviet accord. And after all the angsty-serious portraits of Watergate, it's bliss to see the prime players sent up mercilessly; in addition to Shearer, the cast boasts Dave Foley (Erlichman), Jim Breuer (John Dean), Saul Rubinek (Kissinger), and Ana Gasteyer (Rosemary Woods), all in fine form. Hedaya's Nixon, dead-on but never parodic, is an Oscar-worthy comic turn, and Dunst and Williams invest their characters with affection and humor; the success of the film lies in the way these talented actresses make us laughwithBetsy and Arlene, never at them. Don't be put off by the teen sheen on this comedy--it's also for all of us who still remember Watergate even after 25 years, and still love dancing on the scandal's grave.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303057942"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 509409}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.95, "brand": "", "asin": "B000021Y7C", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517TQG3CXVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dick [VHS]"}

As a surreal work of art,Eraserheadeasily holds it own next to the works as Bu&ntilde;uel, Cocteau, and Dali. And like many surrealistic works, there is no clear answer on whatEraserhead\"means.\" But, if you are trying to find a simple, linear, plot inEraserhead, you are clearly missing the point. ForEraserheadis not simply a movie to view, but a true cinematic experience, like jumping into someone's nightmare and seeing it from their perspective.  Whether you see it as a meditation on the terror of being a new parent, the suffocating feeling of living in an increasingly vapid, industrial wasteland, or a nightmare about the fear of loneliness, the film easily holds up to multiple viewings. And since this film is a dark visual ride and a supreme aural achievement, this long awaited, new transfer is an absolute blessing for David Lynch fans who will finally get to see, hear and experienceEraserheadclearly on DVD.

{"description": "To callPearl Harbora throwback to old-time war movies is something of an understatement. Director Michael Bay's epic take on the bombing that brought the United States into World War II hijacks every war movie situation and clich&#xE9; (some affectionate, some stale) you've ever seen and gives them a shiny, glossy spin until the whole movie practically gleams. Planes glisten, water sparkles, trees beckon--and Bay's re-creation of the bombing itself, a 30-minute sequence that's tightly choreographed and amazingly photographed, sets the action movie bar up quite a few notches. And in updating the classic war film, Bay and screenwriter Randall Wallace (Braveheart) use that old plot standby, the love triangle--this time, it's between two pilots (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) and a nurse (Kate Beckinsale) who find themselves stationed at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, during what they thought would be a nice, sunny tour of duty. Then, of course, history intervened.For the first 90 minutes of the movie, Affleck and Beckinsale find a nice, appealing chemistry that plays on his strengths as a movie star and hers as a serious actress--he gives her glamour, she gives him smarts. Their truncated romance--the beginning of which is told in flashback so we can get right to the point where he has to leave her to go to England--works, thanks to their charm. They're no Kate and Leo fromTitanic(a strategy the film strives hard toward), but they're pretty darn adorable in their own right. Hartnett, as the not entirely unwelcome third wheel, squints bravely but makes only a slight dent in the film. Everyone else inPearl Harbor--from Cuba Gooding Jr.'s brave navy seaman to Jon Voight's able impersonation of FDR--is pretty much a glorified walk-on, taking a backseat to the pyrotechnics and action sequences that keep the three-hour film in fairly constant motion.

{"description": "Although this DVD is wrapped in the handsome packaging of the \"Vista Series,\" the extras here are minimal. The first disc has no extras but is packed with four separate Dolby Digital 5.1 tracks and is THX certified. The second disc holds four features, including a standard making-of featurette (15 minutes long) and a nifty segment that allows viewers to compare the storyboards to the final film and separate the music and sound effects in the train station sequence. More satisfying is the 20-minute short on the state of comic books, featuring revealing comments from critics and authors including Frank Miller (of the touchstoneDark Knightseries). Seven deleted scenes are introduced by the director, and while none is significant to the plot, they are all must-see for fans of the film. Though this first installment of the Vista Series may deliver less than viewers might expect, the exquisite attention to design promises big things from future endeavors.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000JLTR8Q", "B00004BZIY", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00005JL3T", "B00064LJVE", "B00386EZUY", "B003Y5H4SO", "B000XT1P4S", "B000QUU4M8", "B000FFL2G6", "B00562I40K", "B000FKO5QK", "B002GSXKNS", "B000056PMU", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B00005JN2Z", "B0007PALZ2", "B00011CZRE", "B0000524E4", "6305767866", "B00000G3PA", "B001QTXM5Y", "0783232098", "B000RETOH4", "B00004XPPG", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00005N5S5", "B00004STDN", "B000095WW8", "0783226888", "B0018O4YT0", "B0006210ZG", "0767802519", "B00003CXXP", "B003AWRMCE", "B00BTYOYG2", "B004L9GMBC", "B003J42JLC", "B0007DFJ0G", "0800195175", "B002GSXKNI", "B00004Y87O", "0767807588", "B00AEFXRRO", "B00005JL78", "B00AEBB9SM", "630542845X", "B00441GYZG", "B001OQCVI8", "630587493X", "B00001ZWUS", "B000H30B2C", "B003Q6D2B4", "B00026ZD04", "B0009MDPYM", "6305428115", "B00005V4XW", "630471193X", "B00AEFXW8I", "B00005JMWP", "B000P0J0EW", "B000P0I4O4", "B0009X768W", "B0024FADD8", "B00177Y9ZC", "B00070FX5U", "B00000JDIQ", "B00AEFYYH6", "B00005JLWN", "B0062P3392", "B00D2ZF24O", "B00005JNTI", "B004EPYZPS", "B00AEFYCW8", "B004XQO90O", "B002AT8K9W", "0790729342", "B000BRP4BM", "B008JFURII", "B005R08HJY", "B000Z8GZYW", "B00AEBB9CS", "B000RO9Q7W", "0790742047", "B0010X73ZG", "B003Y5H5EW", "B004SIP95G", "B00009W5F3", "B008JFUO36", "B00007GZR5", "B000K7VHQ4", "B000VECAD0", "0767803434", "B005LAII8A", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00005V1WW", "B001GCUO02", "B00BLN4UPG", "B001VLBDD0", "B00I9TDMRM"], "bought_together": ["B00004BZIY", "B00005JL3T"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004BZIY", "B001ECPV8O", "B00000G3PA", "B004SIP92O"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 46140}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 8.94, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00003CXQA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4139YPXT2SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Unbreakable (Two-Disc Vista Series)"}

{"description": "Sistersis not Brian De Palma's first film, but in many ways it is the first Brian De Palma film, or at least the first to reveal (and revel in) his affinity with Hitchcock. A pre-SupermanMargot Kidder struggles with a French-Canadian accent as an aspiring actress whose one-night stand leads to a homicidal morning-after. Jennifer Salt is a reporter with more moxie than tact or skill who sees the killing from her apartment window across the way. When the police fail to turn up any evidence of the crime, Salt investigates with a private eye (the hilariously relentless Charles Durning), uncovering the secret story of a pair of Siamese twins and a weaselly, stalker doctor. It's a mystery simmering in a stew of voyeurism, guilt, sex, and obsession. De Palma borrows fromRear Window,Psycho, andVertigo(as well as Roman Polanski'sRepulsion), and composer Bernard Herrmann quotes from his own Hitchcock scores (notablyPsycho) for the unsettling music, but the result is more original than you might imagine. Laced with dark humor, inventive technique, and impressive technical precision (the split-screen sequences are breathtakingly effective), De Palma flexes his cinematic muscles with thrilling results, right down to the mordantly wry conclusion. De Palma graduated to big-budget thrillers, but this modest little production remains one of his sharpest, slyest, most engrossing films. Long available only in pallid video transfers, the Home Vision/Criterion letterboxed restoration is bright, clear, and beautiful.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005K3NU", "B003TTBA0S", "B00005K3NV", "B00005LIRC", "B000H5TH1Q", "B00005LIRB", "B0058O1FES", "B00GOT15IM", "B0009298N4", "0783228449", "B000S0GYRK", "B0009GX1CE", "B00005NFZC", "B004JPJHL0", "B000IMUYJM", "B00062IVJ4", "B00HVOFP12", "B0007GAG42", "B00K1L4NBU", "B00IGK6T9W", "B000S0GYRU", "B00GBT62PQ", "0780022629", "B004QIT2X8", "B00HRISNPM", "B00HVOFP6W", "B00JQYV0B4", "B004KDYR20", "B00GPPXNLC", "B00L3ZB7JO", "B0056ANHCM", "B00ARWX9NG", "B000069I09", "B000MX7V3O", "B00ITZXDDY", "B0002V7O0Q", "B00F98FOI6", "B00K6D1S7A", "B00IA1VQBS", "B0009HMTKI", "B000NOK0GW", "B004ALIG4W", "B0002JP2OS", "B0026VBOJ2", "B00EVU3S4U", "B0001ZX0GU", "B0002KPHZG", "B00009PY2T", "B004FUPK6U", "B00K72HVBC", "B00005BCK0", "B0001XAKUQ", "B00004Z1FM", "B002AMVEII", "B002U6DVPI", "B000CR76U8", "B00005U2KC", "B00007ELDG", "B001B9ZVVC", "B00HE011DE", "B000ELL1R6", "B00GHH9IIA", "B00DZP1C9K", "B00BOWOBTO", "069220315X", "B005152C78", "B00HZVX14O", "B00GHH9GSC", "0790776960", "B0089LT7ZG", "B00005JMVQ", "B00CPTUNUG", "B00HRUQB8Q", "B00HGBAG5K", "B001152TL6", "B00AQ6J5JU", "B001J710Y8", "B00005M2C7", "B003WKL6YO", "B0000633SD", "B00180R06I", "B000069CF9", "B00006FMCS", "B0002KQNKE", "B00B2BYXTK", "B004ALIG4M", "B003KGBIRK", "B005152C9G", "B00HT2RTU6", "B000TSIJWY", "B00JPUUSSU", "B00BCMT2BI", "B004ALIG1U", "1559409002", "B00000JT2R", "B00GPPXP6A", "B001BEK8F6", "B0002VYOVS", "B00012L77W", "B001D8W7CW"], "bought_together": ["B003TTBA0S", "B00005K3NU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005K3NV", "B00005K3NU", "B003TTBA0S", "B000H5TH1Q"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 82876}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 20.59, "brand": "Image Entertainment", "asin": "B00004W3HG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R9QXTNP9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sisters (The Criterion Collection)"}
{"description": "Frank Sinatra stars with Kim Novak and Eleanor Parker in this riveting drama about a poker dealer/jazz musician who descends to skid row after becoming addicted to heroin. Will he make it back into the spotlight&#x97;or even survive? Based upon the classic American novel by Nelson Algren, The Man with the Golden Arm was far ahead of its time with its depiction of what drugs can do to even an ambitious person. Its cautionary tale still holds up today as heroin has come back to haunt not only the inner city but middle America as well. It contains what Frank Sinatra himself considered his best performance, a role which gained him an Oscar nomination for Best Actor of 1955. Directed by the notorious Otto Preminger, this hard-edged, expressionistic view of the normally-depicted-as-glorious 1950s will come as a fascinating surprise to those who have yet to discover this classic melodrama. Co-starring a young Darren McGavin in his debut film performance, it also contains one of movie score legend Elmer Bernstein&#x92;s best compositions which earned one of the film&#x92;s two other Oscar nominations, along with one for art direction. Includes Original Theatrical Trailer: Approx. 2 min. Film: Approx. 119 min.Bonus Material:  At The Movies With Frank Sinatra Enjoy exclusive and revealing interviews with Hollywood legends Henry Silva (Manchurian Candidate), Beverly Garland (The Joker Is Wild), Ernest Borgnine (From Here To Eternity), and Joey Bishop (Ocean&#x92;s 11). Along with these rare and insightful interviews from the stars are the original coming attraction trailers from these classic moments of cinema magic. Special bonus material includes a revealing backstage look at the making of The Man With The Golden Arm. Sinatra himself is seen in a rare and candid interview. Composer Elmer Bernstein talks about scoring the film, and discusses Sinatra&#x92;s artistic contributions. Star Tommy Sands relates classic moments of what it was like working with Sinatra, and historian Rick Ross talks about the impact of Frank&#x92;s performance in this classic contribution to the annals of Hollywood Cinema.

{"description": "A promising comedy that goes awry all too early,But I'm a Cheerleaderconcerns a misunderstood high school kid (Natasha Lyonne) whose parents send her to a harsh, homosexual-rehabilitation camp despite a lack of evidence that she's gay. Ruled with an iron fist by a fascist counselor (Cathy Moriarty), the clinic only drives Lyonne's character toward an attraction to a rebellious tomboy (Clea DuVall), though screenwriter Brian Wayne Peterson and director Jamie Babbit are curiously intent on keeping the two apart and depriving the audience of other comic possibilities. Meanwhile, hoary clich&eacute;s abound: prancing boys, butch gays, lipstick lesbians. Despite a fine cast full of young talent, and cameo appearances by Julie Delpy and RuPaul Charles, this attempt to skewer a present-day trend in \"curing\" homosexuals of their sexual preferences is flattened by stereotypes and unimaginative thinking.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00002CGGH", "B0001HAGSI", "B000F7CEBG", "B00005QW5T", "B0009298MU", "B00004U104", "B00000I6D4", "B000J4QWIG", "B00023P4M4", "B00006RJ97", "B002SF9YTS", "B00003CYJ4", "B001AJIWQE", "B000AQOHN0", "B00827OWO8", "B008XAGN46", "B00GPPXNIK", "B00AFDN5Y0", "B000062Y1E", "B00011Y1QC", "B000A4T804", "B004BJMEO6", "B000SUKPL6", "B000OVLC0W", "B00004YKR3", "B00441GYVK", "B00003CWN3", "B004N21KIC", "B005Q4CLKW", "B00FKPJ3VM", "B00004STHG", "B000F3UA6Q", "B003YYVSEG", "B00DW5IKYS", "B00CLH0APA", "B0038M61IC", "B000GTJSO4", "0780628306", "B00441GYVA", "B00003CWQR", "B007PXYWBI", "B0002OXRSG", "B005OTQIK8", "B000067D0Y", "B005S9EIGU", "B004EI2NM2", "B0000714BP", "B00005ASPE", "B004AHAEV4", "B00JVLGL7U", "B001Y7CVXC", "B007OXB1H2", "B008XAT0VE", "B004SIP86Q", "B0009QTRVI", "B0002KPIQY", "B004AYMY92", "B000O76ZO4", "B00CBG9SQS", "0316009857", "B003M05KUA", "B00C1LIZEE", "B0085E44W8", "B00005J761", "B00009MEC4", "B004CWLRF4", "B00BDTSLEO", "B00005UJYC", "B0000560PU", "B00435KP44", "B003L20ICE", "B00125WAWI", "0374400113", "6305821216", "B0053TWVQ4", "B00005NRNS", "B005JZBPHS", "B00HW3EXCE", "B000BZISX0", "1575423634", "B000F3UA70", "B00005JKJS", "055327886X", "6305428425", "B007C95S9K", "B00H3RT7M0", "B0037QGS0A", "0792843983", "B000AM6OVW", "B000ETRCMQ", "B0002MPQRS", "B000FDEE86", "B00EMAGCHE", "0062020579", "B00ANGIC4W", "B00AG474YU", "B00005OLBC", "B00CMQIDKY", "0767837398", "B001EHDSPM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00GPPXNIK", "B000F7CEBG", "B00002CGGH", "B00827OWO8"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 189241}, "asin": "B00004X13Q", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DTW1ATQYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "But I'm A Cheerleader"}
{"description": "Adventure movies are hard to come by these days--they've been replaced by action movies, which favor fast cars and big explosions over the dangers of nature and explorations of human character.Breakheart Passstars Charles Bronson as a mysterious petty criminal on the Western frontier. After being caught cheating at cards, he's arrested and held on a military transport train heading through the Rocky Mountains toward a fort on the coast, a fort stricken with diphtheria and in desperate need of the medical supplies on the train. But there's a conspiracy afoot--people on the train keep getting killed or disappearing--and the situation at the fort isn't what it seems either. Alistair MacLean adapted the screenplay from his own novel, and it's a well-plotted, efficient piece of work, made more compelling by a cast of solid character actors, ranging from Charles Durning (The Sting,Tootsie), Richard Crenna (Body Heat), and Ben Johnson (Oscar winner forThe Last Picture Show) to guys whose faces you'll recognize, even if their names don't sound familiar.Breakheart Passisn'tThe Treasure of the Sierra Madre, and Bronson isn't Humphrey Bogart, but the movie is a lean adventure flick with an outstanding score by Jerry Goldsmith.

{"description": "This 1994 OAV was the first of several revivals of the 1973 TV series based on Go Nagai'smangastories. The characters are an assortment of familiar types. Diminutive, cartoony Grandfather Denbei appears alternately powerful and lecherous. Chokkei is the blushing teenage boy whose innocent charm earns him the protection of the buxom title character, the \"lovely warrior\" android who fights evil while losing her clothes with a frequency that would shock Little Annie Fannie. They're pitted against the demonic Dolmek and his hench-creatures who are trying to take over Cosplay City. But Honey proves more than a match for these nasty but ultimately ineffectual villains as she jiggles her way from victory to victory.New Cutey Honeyembodies the \"big eyes, big guns, big breasts\" clich&#xE9;s that cause detractors to dismiss all Japanese animation--and send adolescent boys' pulses racing.

{"description": "It's a mixed blessing, butFrank Herbert's Dunegoes a long way toward satisfying science fiction purists who scoffed at David Lynch's previous attempt to adapt Herbert's epic narrative. Ironically, director John Harrison's 288-minute TV miniseries (broadcast on the Sci-Fi Channel in December 2000) offers its own share of strengths and weaknesses, which, in retrospect, emphasize the quality of Lynch's film while treating Herbert's novel with more comprehensive authority. Debate will continue as to which film is better; Lynch's extensive use of internal monologue now seems like a challenge well met, and Harrison's more conventional approach is better equipped to convey the epic scope of Herbert's interplanetary political intrigue.This much is certain: thisDuneis a sumptuous treat for the eyes, with sets and costumes that were conceived with no apparent limits of budget or creativity. In terms of architecture alone, this is one of the most impressive films in science fiction history. And although the special effects fall short of feature-film quality, writer-director Harrison (who rose from an extensive background in TV) admirably tames the sprawling narrative that pits the opposing houses of Atreides and Harkonnen in a struggle to control the lucrative market for the spice melange. This is as accurate as anyDuneadaptation is likely to get (i.e., there's no need for another attempt), and even then, it can be tricky to keep track of who's doing what to whom. Unfortunately, the film's biggest flaws are the casting of a nearly comatose William Hurt as Duke Leto, and a wooden Alec Newman as the messiah-to-be, Paul Atreides. These are regrettable shortcomings, but thisDuneremains altogether respectable. That Frank Herbert would be impressed is perhaps the biggest compliment one can pay.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"bought_together": ["B00008RUYH"], "also_viewed": ["B00008RUYH", "6300183971", "B00371QQ0M", "B008R65XN8", "B00008V61T"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 403297}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 5.82, "brand": "", "asin": "B000053V8F", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41DS5D1W96L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Frank Herbert's Dune (TV Miniseries) [VHS]"}
{"description": "Twenty-first-century science fiction fans accustomed to special-effects orgies likeThe Matrixmay snigger at the quaint,Flash Gordon-like spaceships inBattle Beyond the Stars. But executive producer Roger Corman's belated entry into the '70s sci-fi craze surpasses expectations with sharp performances and a witty script by John Sayles (his third for Corman, including 1978'sPiranha). The story, lifted wholesale from Akira Kurosawa'sSeven Samurai(1954), finds the dictator Sador (John Saxon) threatening the planet of Akira. Its pacifist inhabitants are no match for Sador's devastating weapon, the Stellar Converter, but young Shad (Richard Thomas) decides to fight back. Borrowing the ship of notorious mercenary Zed the Corsair, he recruits a band of mercenaries, each of whom has a personal reason to join the fight. Among them are a lizard-like humanoid (Morgan Woodward), an improbable space cowboy (George Peppard), a zaftig female warrior (Sybil Danning), and brooding killer-for-hire Gelt (Robert Vaughn, reprising hisMagnificent Sevenrole).Battle's final showdown is somewhat anticlimatic, but the surprisingly stellar cast (which includes Sam Jaffe and Darlanne Fluegel) and the indie spunk of Sayles' script, with its light meditations on death and honor, will charm newcomers and repeat audiences alike. New Concorde's digitally remastered DVD features commentary by Sayles andTerminator 2producer Gale Anne Hurd,Battle's assistant production manager. Oh, and those spaceships?

He moves effortlessly  between standards by Gershwin, Cole Porter, Thelonious Monk, and others, several  Latin-tinged numbers, and a variety of more contemporary material by the Beatles  (\"Blackbird,\" \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\") and by Rankin himself. While  Rankin may not be strictly a jazz or pop singer, neither should he be glibly  characterized as an \"AOR artist\"; there's too much real musicianship happening  here to relegate him to background music status.

{"description": "With its disturbing images and a few good shocks,The Ringis the kind of frightfest you'll watch to set a chilling mood or spook your susceptible friends, but when you try to sort it out, this well-mounted American remake (of the 1998 Japanese hitRingu, based on Koji Suzuki's popular novel) becomes a batch of incoherent parts. The negligible plot follows a Seattle reporter (Naomi Watts) as she investigates the death of her niece, the victim of a mysterious videotape that, according to urban legend, causes the viewer's death seven days later.

Jenkins and composer BT discuss the score in the other featurette, including how \"the score was conceived from the ground up in 5.1\" (the DVD's sound is all-enveloping) as well as the use of the hurdy-gurdy and the contribution of Journey's Steve Perry (even this featurette is in DTS). There's also a film-mixing demo, in which the viewer can add or subtract (but not change the levels of) the dialogue, sound effects, and music in a two-minute segment of the Funworld scene.

{"description": "Batman Beginsdiscards the previous four films in the series and recasts the Caped Crusader as a fearsome avenging angel. That's good news, because the series, which had gotten off to a rousing start under Tim Burton, had gradually dissolved into self-parody by 1997'sBatman & Robin. As the title implies,Batman Beginstells the story anew, when Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) flees Western civilization following the murder of his parents. He is taken in by a mysterious instructor named Ducard (Liam Neeson in another mentor role) and urged to become a ninja in the League of Shadows, but he instead returns to his native Gotham City resolved to end the mob rule that is strangling it. But are there forces even more sinister at hand?Cowritten by the team of David S. Goyer (a veteran comic book writer) and director Christopher Nolan (Memento),Batman Beginsis a welcome return to the grim and gritty version of the Dark Knight, owing a great debt to the graphic novels that preceded it. It doesn't have the razzle dazzle, or the mass appeal, ofSpider-Man 2(though the Batmobile is cool), and retelling the origin means it starts slowly, like most \"first\" superhero movies. But it's certainly the best Bat-film since Burton's original, and one of the best superhero movies of its time. Bale cuts a good figure as Batman, intense and dangerous but with some of the lightheartedness Michael Keaton brought to the character. Michael Caine provides much of the film's humor as the family butler, Alfred, and as the love interest, Katie Holmes (Dawson's Creek) is surprisingly believable in her first adult role. Also featuring Gary Oldman as the young police officer Jim Gordon, Morgan Freeman as a Q-like gadgets expert, and Cillian Murphy as the vile Jonathan Crane.--David HoriuchiBatmanat Amazon.comAllBatmanDVDsBatman Begins101: A Comic Book PrimerWhere Have I Seen Christian Bale?AllBatmanComics and Graphic NovelsBatmanToysBatman BeginsSoundtrackStills fromBatman Begins(click for larger images)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA", "B002GSXKN8", "B000P0J06U", "B001OST0LW", "B000P0J06K", "B004EPZ07K", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00005JKCH", "B001GCUO1Q", "B002ZG980U", "B001OST0M6", "B008JFUPFI", "B004LWZWFQ", "B00005JMQW", "B004LWZW42", "B000VI70QS", "B001DHXT20", "B000M341QE", "B0000959N0", "B000UR9T8C", "B00005JNTU", "B000AYELVA", "B00E5I2M6I", "B002IPFWTE", "B000HEVZ9E", "B0090SI56Y", "B002HWRYJE", "B0006L0LOS", "B000OVLBF8", "B00003CWT6", "B000VR0570", "B00E5I2MEK", "B000HCO83Q", "B0007P0Y7C", "B008JFUO72", "B00F4FFO8E", "B001CDR1FG", "B000P0J0EW", "B002T9H2LA", "B0002KVUKM", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00005N5S5", "B0083SBMBM", "B0001BKAEY", "B00AQSN7HE", "B000J10EQU", "B00005JKZY", "B002NXSRVG", "B000AYELVU", "B001OQCV6A", "B004LWZW4M", "B001VLBDD0", "B001GZ6QEC", "B004GJYRA0", "B007REV4T8", "B001TK80C0", "B000HRJLII", "B001QTXM5Y", "B005G4TJUC", "B00005JKZV", "B0053FANT0", "B00005JA8B", "B003YAR97K", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00001ZWUS", "B004EPYZQC", "B001N44BVQ", "B006VRRGNK", "B001AEF6HM", "B00000JQB5", "B00011CZRE", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00AEFY0F2", "B007K3JFUQ", "B0002IQMAM", "B00005JN0T", "B002SJIO4A", "B000VWYJ86", "B0013FDM7E", "B00005JNTI", "B00407PNY2", "B00DTPRZ24", "B008JFUS0U", "B00004Z4WR", "B000FS9FCG", "B000QXDED6", "B0085A9HU6", "0780624890", "B00005LOUK", "B000065U1N", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005JN5T", "B001QB9H1U", "B00005JMUA", "0792844890", "B0007DFJ0G", "B004EPYZSK", "B008JFUOWM", "B00AEFY5B6"], "bought_together": ["B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009JBWOU0", "B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA", "B002ZG980U"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7806}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.99, "brand": "DC Comics", "asin": "B00005JNJV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518zjc4XtzL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Batman Begins (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "As paranoid cop Del Spooner, Will Smith (Independence Day,Men in Black) displays both his trademark quips and some impressive pectoral muscles inI, Robot. Only Spooner suspects that the robots that provide the near future with menial labor are going to turn on mankind--he's just not sure how. When a leading roboticist dies suspiciously, Spooner pursues a trail that may prove his suspicions. Don't expect much of a connection to Isaac Asimov's classic science fiction stories;I, Robot, the action movie, isn't prepared for any ruminations on the significance of artificial intelligence. This likable, efficient movie won't break any new ground, but it does have an idea or two to accompany its jolts and thrills, which puts it ahead of most recent action flicks. Also featuring Bridget Moynahan (The Sum of All Fears), Bruce Greenwood (The Sweet Hereafter), and James Cromwell (Babe,LA Confidential).--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0013FDM7E", "B0013J55B6", "B005LAIGPA", "B00005JL78", "B00008G8M4", "B005LAIHXQ", "B00003CXXP", "B004AOECXI", "B00005JMXX", "B005LAIHYU", "6305428115", "B0049IHX2C", "B004LWZW9W", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B0067EKYAY", "B005LAIIHG", "B00177YA1K", "B001QERPAC", "B002ZG980U", "630587493X", "B000VG66XS", "B000N6U0E2", "B00005JKWX", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B000957O82", "B004LWZW4M", "B004UXUX4Q", "B00DV2MVWO", "B005LAIGRS", "B0000844I8", "B004LWZW8I", "B002ZG997C", "B00AEFXPSK", "B000AP04FG", "B008MIMWQW", "B006TTC5PY", "B00070FX5U", "B00081912E", "B0009MDPYM", "B00005JNTU", "0553294385", "B004XQO90O", "B00CWM58WY", "B001L57ZYM", "B00E8RKHWW", "B00005JPD0", "B00AEBB86A", "B007REV4T8", "B000FFL2G6", "B00005JL3K", "B001TODCII", "B00AEFXCLU", "B003UYUQZW", "B00000G3PA", "B0001NBNDY", "6305767866", "B0002V7OI8", "B000GFLKF8", "B003Q6D2B4", "B00005JKMQ", "B0000B1OFL", "B00AAQHP66", "055338256X", "B0000ACOXL", "B0090SI56Y", "0783225733", "B00AEFZ2DG", "B00003CWU3", "B00BB67UNW", "B00005JN0W", "B00005JNQS", "B00AEFYCW8", "B001GZ6QC4", "B0002KVUKM", "B00561BNI6", "B002GOAH1A", "B000GBEWHK", "B0000959N0", "B002I9Z8EO", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B00005JMZK", "B001OQCV2E", "B00004Z4WR", "B002O3Z510", "B000JYW5BE", "B000FS9FCG", "B00005JNTI", "B00BTYOYG2", "B002SG7Z7A", "B00A7MSQRK", "B000AYELVA", "B002ZG98LO", "B000ENC5YW", "0783240295", "B002GHHHME", "B005LAII3A", "B0045HCJ9O", "B00LG6YEKE", "B002NXSRVG", "B00004BZIY"], "bought_together": ["B004AOECXI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AZMFJYA", "B002SG7Z7A", "B00005JA8B", "B0087ZG7HK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8757}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00005JN0T", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513MNJSY0FL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "I, Robot (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Despite super effects, a huge budget, and the cinematic pedigree of alien-happy Steven Spielberg, this take on H.G. Wells's novel is basically a horror film packaged as a sci-fi thrill ride. Instead of a mad slasher, however, Spielberg (along with writers Josh Friedman & David Koepp) utilizes aliens hell-bent on quickly destroying humanity, and the terrifying results that prey upon adult fears, especially in the post-9/11 world. The realistic results could be a new genre, the grim popcorn thriller; often you feel like you're watching Schindler's List more than Spielberg's other thrill-machine movies (Jaws,Jurassic Park). The film centers on Ray Ferrier, a divorced father (Tom Cruise, oh so comfortable) who witnesses one giant craft destroy his New Jersey town and soon is on the road with his teen son (Justin Chatwin) and preteen daughter (Dakota Fanning) in tow, trying to keep ahead of the invasion. The film is, of course, impeccably designed and produced by Spielberg's usual crew of A-class talent. The aliens are genuinely scary, even when the film--like the novel--spends a good chunk of time in a basement. Readers of the book (or viewers of the deft 1953 adaptation) will note the variation of whom and how the aliens come to Earth, which poses some logistical problems. The film opens and closes with narration from the novel read by Morgan Freeman, but Spielberg could have adapted Orson Welles's words from the famous Halloween Eve 1938 radio broadcast: \"We couldn't soap all your windows and steal all your garden gates by tomorrow night, so we did the best next thing: we annihilated the world.\"--Doug ThomasWar of the Worldsat Amazon.comThe SoundtrackThe War of the Worlds(1953)War of the Worlds - The Complete First Season(TV series)Classic Sci-Fi Movies and Their RemakesAliens Invade on DVDThe Prog-rock Opera (no kidding)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B00005JL78", "B001SGEUYW", "B00008G8M4", "B00005JL3T", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AEFXNLY", "B00005JMXX", "B001OQCV2E", "B000VECAD0", "B002O3Z510", "B0002V7OI8", "B000H30B2C", "B000EGDB10", "B00005JN2Z", "B005LAIIMG", "B005PTYP70", "B002O3Z50G", "B0002V7ON8", "B00005JN0T", "B00K2CHW48", "B002SJIO4A", "0783225547", "B008JFUO36", "B00005JKLZ", "B00AS1Q93S", "1936594056", "B004EPYZUS", "B001TUZG4K", "B00AEFXR1K", "B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFXYJA", "0767817478", "B0034G4ORC", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00070FX5U", "B0045HCJSA", "B00000G3PA", "B005LAIHPE", "B003Y5H5GK", "B00AEBBA72", "B00003CWU3", "B00I9TDMRM", "B001ECDVKE", "B00003CXXP", "B000V4UFZK", "B0010X73ZG", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00005JKFR", "B000XT1P4S", "B003HKN52U", "B0009PW4D2", "B000HRMAPE", "B004EPYZPS", "B0018QPPXW", "B0002WZTOI", "B00AEBB9LO", "B004LWZW4M", "B003ABZHAO", "B003YJFALS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B000OT6V64", "B004P7CN7W", "B000CCBC9O", "B00000ILDD", "0767803434", "B001L57ZYM", "B000065V3G", "B007STBUHI", "B002ZG980U", "B008JFUQZ2", "B00005B6JZ", "B0006GANOQ", "B000F1IQN2", "1494343576", "B001GCUO02", "B00004Y87O", "0783226810", "B004EPYZSK", "B000P0J0BU", "B005LAIHXQ", "B001680M26", "B000EQHXN2", "B0045HCJFS", "B00004BZIY", "B00008G8M5", "B00003CXQA", "B008JFUS0U", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00EIN6KJ0", "B0000DZ6N3", "B000MV8A9A", "B00005JKYX", "B0000YEEGM", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B0013FCWUW", "B002ZG9864", "B00003CWTI", "B008MIMWQW", "B00IKM5OCO"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBB8VK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B004LWZW4M", "B00005JL78", "B004EPYZSK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18739}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JNTI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51upxzPRnXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "War of the Worlds"}

{"description": "March of the Penguinsinstantly qualifies as a wildlife classic, taking its place among other extraordinary films likeMicrocosmosandWinged Migration. French filmmaker Luc Jacquet and his devoted crew endured a full year of extreme conditions in Antarctica to capture the life cycle of Emperor penguins on film, and their diligence is evident in every striking frame of this 80-minute documentary. Narrated in soothing tones by Morgan Freeman, the film focuses on a colony of hundreds of Emperors as they return, in a single-file march of 70 miles or more, to their frozen breeding ground, far inland from the oceans where they thrive. At times dramatic, suspenseful, mischievous and just plain funny, the film conveys the intensity of the penguins' breeding cycle, and their treacherous task of protecting eggs and hatchlings in temperatures as low as 128 degrees below zero. There is some brief mating-ritual violence and sad moments of loss, butMarch of the Penguinsremains family-friendly throughout, and kids especially will enjoy the Antarctic blue-ice vistas and the playful, waddling appeal of the penguins, who can be slapstick clumsy or magnificently graceful, depending on the circumstances. A marvel of wildlife cinematography, this unique film offers a front-row seat to these amazing creatures, balancing just enough scientific information with the entertaining visuals.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B000BI5KV0", "B000BI5KUQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BI5KV0", "B008MIL45M", "B000BI5KUQ", "B00HR3D56O"]}, "price": 27.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JOFZ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51W4YDJTQJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "March of the Penguins"}

{"description": "Helen Mirren reigns supreme inThe Queen, a witty and ingenious look at a moment that rocked the house of Windsor:  the week that followed the sudden death of Princess Diana in 1997. Diana's death came at just the same time that Prime Minister Tony Blair (played by the bright Michael Sheen) was settling into his new government--and trying to figure out the delicate relationship between 10 Downing Street and Queen Elizabeth II (Mirren). A large portion of the British population was trying to figure out the Windsors that week, as Elizabeth remained stiff-upper-lip and largely mum about the death of the beloved princess. In Peter Morgan's skillful script, we watch as Blair grows increasingly impatient with the Royals, who are sequestered in their Scottish estate while the public demands some show of grief. Prince Philip (James Cromwell, in good form) clumsily decides to take Diana's sons hunting, while a sympathetically-treated Prince Charles (Alex Jennings) displays some frustration with his mother's eerie calm.None of this conveys how funny the film is, or how deftly it flows from one scene to the next. Director Stephen Frears (Dirty Pretty Things) deserves great credit for that, and for the performances, and for the movie's marvelous sense of well-roundedness; you could see this movie and groan at the cluelessness of the Royals and their outmoded existence, or you might just sympathize with showing reserve in a world that values gross public displays of emotion. But either way, you'll marvel at Mirren, who makes the Queen far more alert and human than one might ever have imagined.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B003UESJH4", "B001C4AFOY", "B004M9QNVK", "B004GXKBDI", "B0059XTUVI", "B000Z8H0IC", "B000ZOXDFA", "B000RF7XYO", "B001L57ZZG", "B001TH92N4", "B000BKDNX0", "B0006Q93H4", "B000EOTELI", "B004XYOQU4", "B009TT0BSE", "B0012QE4Q2", "B001QUF3SW", "B007HW8U2Y", "B000EHQUGC", "B00342ANSA", "B004SIP9U6", "B000V02CNW", "B00005O7N8", "B00GM7STPI", "B003N9ASF2", "B002ZG99EK", "B004SIP71M", "B003Y5H4Y8", "B0001I55M4", "B001AZIRVI", "B00015HXDG", "B000E1NXJ0", "B000RF7XYY", "B00121QGPY", "B009AMANBA", "B000M06KJ8", "B000MEYJHY", "B00005JOFQ", "B007TBJUVI", "B0085A9JXG", "B003AND1SM", "B000NIVJF4", "B0010X73Z6", "B000K7VHQE", "B00005JKNF", "B000MCH5P4", "B001TR4G6W", "B004P7CNZO", "B0050PYNN0", "B000GH3CR0", "B00AEFY8MM", "B0068MNO4S", "B002RSDW80", "B001MVWFAO", "B004ZNFTDQ", "B000255LIY", "B000V6LSOA", "B00ARX2VZW", "B000G6BM0K", "B008220C38"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003UESJH4", "B004M9QNVK", "B001C4AFOY", "B004GXKBDI"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPAM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K34G0GCBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Queen"}
{"description": "More exciting than The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspiancontinues the movie franchise based on C.S. Lewis' classic fantasy books. The movie picks up where the first left off... sort of. It's been a year since the Pevensie children--Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and Lucy (Georgie Henley)--returned to England from Narnia, and they've just about resigned themselves to living their ordinary lives. But just like that, they're once again transported to a fantastical land, but one with a long-abandoned castle. It turns out that they are in Narnia again--and they themselves lived in that castle, but hundreds of years ago in Narnia time. They've been summoned back to help Prince Caspian (Stardust's Ben Barnes, resembling a young, cultured Keanu Reeves), the rightful heir to the throne who's become the target of his power-hungry uncle, King Mraz (Sergio Castellitto). And he's not the only one threatened: Mraz's people, the Telmarines, have pushed all the Narnians--the talking animals, the centaurs and other beasts, the walking trees--to the brink of extinction. Despite some alpha-male bickering, Peter and Caspian agree to fight Mraz alongside the remaining Narnians, including the dwarf Trumpkin (Peter Dinklage) and the swashbuckling mouse Reepicheep (voiced by Eddie Izzard). (Also appearing is Warwick Davis, who was in Willow and the 1989 BBC Prince Caspian.) But of course they most of all miss the noble lion, Aslan, who would have never let this happen to Narnia if he hadn't disappeared. Prince Caspian is epic, evoking memories of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films. (Some of the battle elements may seem too familiar, but they were in Lewis's book.) And it's appropriate for kids (Reepicheep could have come out of a Shrek movie), though the tone is dark and there is a lot of death, albeit bloodless. After two successful films, Disney and Walden Media's franchise has proved successful enough that many of the characters are scheduled to return in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. --David HoriuchiStills fromThe Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian(Click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004M1A21K", "B000E8M0VA", "B0047H7Q22", "B000LPS4J8", "B000OYCM5I", "B003ZHR6TS", "B00AEBB8KQ", "0061992887", "B00139W3NE", "B001NPD9JA", "B0016Q2D5M", "B00005JM5E", "0060598247", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00HFFE8HE", "B004OBQDFM", "B002ZG99PY", "B000I0RQVI", "B001APZMJS", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00BEZTMFY", "B002ZG9904", "B005COPWZW", "B0011U52E2", "B00J0BTEZM", "B00AEFY9RG", "B008D1RDL2", "B0001HAISG", "B006VRRGNK", "B0013BM63O", "B00AEFYIQ8", "B00JBV4R3U", "B005LAIISA", "B001DHXT20", "B008JFUNTG", "B001HN694K", "B001QB5SS6", "B000AAF1TU", "B000GUJZ00", "B0013FSL3E", "B0012IWO0I", "B002ZG97YM", "B0000959N0", "B004AKCME8", "B000VNMMQG", "B0006GANV4", "B000Q66FB6", "B000HEWEE4", "B003HARV3Y", "B00CWM58WY", "B003L20IJM", "B002IPFWTE", "B00005JKZY", "1416995978", "B00005JG6M", "B000VBJEEG", "B001LPWGBO", "B008JFUO72", "B00128VA76", "B0009NZ2KG", "B00028HBES", "B0000640SC", "B00005JKZV", "B00003CWT6", "B00I6JOD2S", "B00JK531ES", "B004EPYZUS", "B001LXIDVS", "B004SIP75S", "B00005JN5E", "B004A8ZWUQ", "B004A8ZWW4", "B006P0FIGU", "B001NE80P4", "B00E5I2M6I", "B003ZHVJGO", "B000VWYJ86", "B002BWP49C", "B00275EHJG", "B00003CXC3", "B002ZG99KO", "B0030IIYYS", "B0006FYOTC", "B00EV1YZ96", "B00005JN4W", "B005LAIIMG", "B008JFUQ16", "B005LAIIPS", "B000BB1MI2", "B0030ZIZRC", "B0000DZ3EN", "B000W746GK", "B000UR9T8C", "B002PMV9FG", "B000BJ7BCK", "B00006ZXSK", "B001KVZ6FW", "B007R6DJP8"], "bought_together": ["B000E8M0VA", "B004M1A21K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004M1A21K", "B000E8M0VA", "B003ZHR6TS", "0061992887"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3310}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.68, "brand": "Walt Disney Video", "asin": "B00005JPH2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/618uTYKkadL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian"}

{"description": "\"I bought a car. Turned out to be an alien robot. Who knew?\" deadpans Sam Witwicky, hero and human heart of Michael Bay's rollicking robot-smackdown fest,Transformers. Witwicky (the sweetly nerdy Shia LaBeouf, channeling a young John Cusack) is the perfect counterpoint to the nearly nonstop exhilarating action. The plot is simple: an alien civil war (the Autobots vs. the evil Decepticons) has spilled onto Earth, and young Sam is caught in the fray by his newly purchased souped-up Camaro. Which has a mind--and identity, as a noble-warrior robot named Bumblebee--of its own. The effects, especially the mind-blowing transformations of the robots into their earthly forms and back again, are stellar.Fans of the earlier film and TV series will be thrilled at this cutting-edge incarnation, but this version should please all fans of high-adrenaline action. Director Bay gleefully salts the movie with homages to pop-culture touchstones likeRaiders of the Lost Ark,King Kong, and the early technothrillerWarGames. The actors, though clearly all supporting those kickass robots, are uniformly on-target, including the dashing Josh Duhamel as a U.S. Army sergeant fighting an enemy he never anticipated; Jon Voight, as a tough yet sympathetic Secretary of Defense in over his head; and John Turturro, whose special agent manages to be confidently unctuous, even stripped to his undies. But the film belongs to Bumblebee, Optimus Prime, and the dastardly Megatron--and the wicked stunts they collide in all over the globe. Long live Transformers! --A.T. HurleyOn the DVDThe special edition ofTransformersis packed with extras (and more than a few product placements for Hasbro). The entire second disc is devoted to featurettes on aspects of making the technical tour-de-force--and the land mines involved in tinkering with a beloved '80s franchise. Executive producer Steven Spielberg is very much a part of the proceedings, from his introductory comments (\"I think everybody likes the idea of taking something you're familiar with and turning it into something you're not so familiar with--like an 18-wheeler become Optimus Prime\") to mentions of his films that influenced this one, likeE.T.andClose Encounters of the Third Kind.Director Michael Bay is brash and entertaining as he talks about his initial reluctance to take on the project, his indoctrination at \"Transformers U\" at Hasbro, and his enthusiasm for guerrilla-style action filmmaking. Star Shia LaBoeuf says, \"He is the sickest action director\" out there, and there's plenty of evidence here to support that. Other great highlights include features on how key scenes were shot, including the heart-pounding desert battle and the shootout in the streets of downtown L.A.--adrenaline-pumping stuff, even without the Transformers CGI'd in. --A.T.

{"description": "Produced by World Wrestling Entertainment mogul Vince McMahon,See No Evila standard-issue death-fest designed for maximum gross-out appeal, and in that sense it delivers the goods with crushed heads, multiple eye-gougings, throat-rippings and other grisly fates that gore fans will want to discover for themselves. If your idea of a good time is watching a mangy dog urinate into the vacant eye socket of a corpse, this is just the movie for you! In an attempt to create a new horror icon like Freddy Krueger or Jason Voorhees, former porno director Gregory Dark and less-than-stellar screenwriter Dan Madigan have dreamed up a routine plot that's hardly original, but deviously addictive to anyone who digs this kind of stuff: Eight troubled and not-very-bright teens, fresh out of a detention center, are given a second chance when they're taken to the decrepit, filthy Blackwell Hotel and told to clean the place up so it can be turned into a homeless shelter. What they don't know is that the hotel hides a secret, axe-wielding resident named Jacob Goodnight (played by WWE superstar Glen \"Kane\" Jacobs) who's got a knack for plucking the eyeballs from his hapless and ill-fated victims. He's basically an evil kid in the hulking body of a wrestler (call it type-casting, if you will), andSee No Evilis more sick than scary as Jacob does his handiwork, which includes the rather hilarious and grimly ironic dispatch of an animal rights activist, to name just one item in the movie's smorgasbord of splatter. At a brisk 85 minutes, the movie's over before you can work up any genuine terror. Still, a sequel seems likely (even if it's straight-to-video), and devoted horror fans will want to check it out.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B001LPWGC8", "B00009ZPU3", "B003L20IF6", "B000SM6FKY", "B002S0OB8W", "B0021L8UG2", "B001053038", "B001QB9H2E", "B000RGN2IY", "B001B1876G", "B002NPY7F4", "B0029XFN94", "B001R10BIC", "B002DKGWSO", "B00546031G", "B004SEUJVO", "B003PBYSTA", "B004RQDWIU", "B003Y5H4SY", "B002QVFOOI", "B000I5XOV4", "B00275EHDW", "B005LS4MUA", "B00005JOWW", "B003C5FMJE", "B003Q6D282", "B000KX0HH8", "B005DCJ218", "B004SIP9GK", "B004634VFM", "B0021L8UHQ", "B001AQMBHI", "B000HCO80E", "B001RHGRSY", "B00194XBPW", "B0029O0BMC", "B004CJB0A4", "B0021L8UQ2", "B001MFNB4E", "B003Y5H5G0", "B000EWBKLC", "B000O5B4CE", "B00LLAV26O", "B002JT69IM", "B0058O1FNO", "B002CVQAX6", "B002CVQAXQ", "B001FBJUXG", "B005DCJ1J6", "B00AIBZL14", "B001MVYUQQ", "B004GGQMUQ", "B008XAT118", "B0029O0BJU", "B004LOUD80", "B002NPY7EU", "B003H9LIRA", "B004BLTNL6", "B001M9ELP8", "B0021L8UXK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002QVFOOI", "B0057YUV6C", "B00E8RK5OC", "B000UJ48UO"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JOZS", "imUrl": "http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-site/icons/no-img-sm._CB192198896_.gif", "title": "See no Evil Art Prints &amp; Posters"}

{"description": "The Dark Knightarrives with tremendous hype (best superhero movie ever? posthumous Oscar for Heath Ledger?), and incredibly, it lives up to all of it.  But calling it the best superhero movie ever seems like faint praise, since part of what makes the movie great--in addition to pitch-perfect casting, outstanding writing, and a compelling vision--is that it bypasses the normal fantasy element of the superhero genre and makes it all terrifyingly real.  Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is Gotham City's new district attorney, charged with cleaning up the crime rings that have paralyzed the city. He enters an uneasy alliance with the young police lieutenant, Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), and Batman (Christian Bale), the caped vigilante who seems to trust only Gordon--and whom only Gordon seems to trust. They make progress until a psychotic and deadly new player enters the game: the Joker (Heath Ledger), who offers the crime bosses a solution--kill the Batman. Further complicating matters is that Dent is now dating Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, after Katie Holmes turned down the chance to reprise her role), the longtime love of Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne.In his last completed role before his tragic death, Ledger is fantastic as the Joker, a volcanic, truly frightening force of evil. And he sets the tone of the movie: the world is a dark, dangerous place where there are no easy choices.  Eckhart and Oldman also shine, but as good as Bale is, his character turns out rather bland in comparison (not uncommon for heroes facing more colorful villains). Director-cowriter Christopher Nolan (Memento) follows his critically acclaimedBatman Beginswith an even better sequel that sets itself apart from notable superhero movies likeSpider-Man 2andIron Manbecause of its sheer emotional impact and striking sense of realism--there are no suspension-of-disbelief superpowers here. At 152 minutes, it's a shade too long, and it's much too intense for kids. But for most movie fans--and not just superhero fans--The Dark Knightis a film for the ages.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B000PC6A3E", "B002ZG981E", "B00G4RD4PQ", "B0039208QM", "B001GMALGY", "B00E2Y0YBK", "B00C2IGQBA", "B0039208JE", "B00H14WTLQ", "B0039208CG", "B0085D3I3K", "B0039208C6", "B000M5AJQI", "B00319ECGK", "B001FB55H6", "B00EIG5M5A", "7020070078", "B00E2Y6AUY", "B00D5FMGGS", "B001OQCV6K", "B0013FBS20", "B000Q6GX5Y", "B001GKJ2FC", "B00FPS79F6", "B001992NUQ", "B004JMSIRC", "B001RIY4WE", "B00DYEN6XC", "B008QZ5PY2", "B001F7MSG6", "B00FAHYNWE", "B00J7PRJXU", "B001AQT0Z4", "B001UV4XEW", "B0083SBJXS", "B00AEFY552", "B00C8RD79O", "B007KAJG3K", "B007L4HET8", "B004EPZ07U", "B007L4HFDI", "B00AEFXKOO", "B000PC0U1W", "B00C6B8TB8", "B00HINFI4K", "B003TT2X6I", "B001KZIRM2", "B002ZG99NG", "B00EZ4M68G", "B004SIP90G", "B003ZHR6RK", "B001GCUO16", "B003TT2X6S", "B00JNEWSLS", "B001F3FUK6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B002ZG981E", "B000PC6A3E"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPY0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pGxSkkz4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Dark Knight [Theatrical Release]"}
{"description": "Another of those cut-and-paste comedies from Adam Sandler's production company starring one of Sandler's erstwhileSaturday Night Livecolleagues,The Adventures of Joe Dirtfinds the magnificently caustic David Spade emasculated by a sentimental script and shapeless, haphazard cutting. Spade plays the title character, a white-trash orphan in search of the parents who abandoned him at the Grand Canyon. The humor is supposed to come from Joe's misadventures, his redneck gullibility, and his encounters with such figures as a serial killer, a wacked-out janitor (Christopher Walken), and a lovable gal (Jamie Pressly) who may, unfortunately, turn out to be his sister. But the squishier requirements of the story, requiring the audience to feel deeply for the pain of Spade's caricature, are an irritant and force Spade to veer from the nastier stuff he does so well.

{"description": "Amores Perrosroughly translates to \"Love's a bitch,\" and it's an apt summation of this remarkable film's exploration of passion, loss, and the fragility of our lives. In telling three stories connected by one traumatic incident, Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu uses an intricate screenplay by novelist Guillermo Arriaga to make three movies in close orbit, expressing the notion that we are defined by what we lose--from our loves to our family, our innocence, or even our lives. These interwoven tales--about a young man in love with his brother's pregnant wife, a perfume spokeswoman and her married lover, and a scruffy vagrant who sidelines as a paid killer--are united by a devastating car crash that provides the film's narrative nexus, and by the many dogs that the characters own or care for. There is graphic violence, prompting a disclaimer that controversial dog-fight scenes were harmless and carefully supervised, but what emerges fromAmores Perrosis a uniquely conceptual portrait of people whom we come to know through their relationship with dogs. The film is simultaneously bleak, cynical, insightful, and compassionate, with layers of meaning that are sure to reward multiple viewings.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JL57", "B0041KKYF6", "B00008AOX5", "B000N3T0DW", "B001UV4XC4", "B0001CNRRU", "B0002TT0MI", "B002FHGESI", "B0036TGSJE", "B00005JNCZ", "B00AEFXGIY", "B00005JLQW", "B00080Z53O", "B000O76ZQC", "B00006G8G3", "B002M2T1VI", "B000FII31A", "B000GETTJI", "B00180IPM6", "B004XVMCMG", "B0041KKYFG", "B000K2V7F0", "B004SIP6GI", "B000YIGNCC", "B003O3EKRO", "B001S400C0", "B00005LZOD", "B002VECLXC", "B002H0LCGM", "B005HFI7IU", "B0007OCG5G", "B0011FLH14", "B008S2NABI", "B00GJNQ3S0", "B000JBXH78", "B0052LE7C4", "B000RHRGSK", "B001BNFR8U", "B000UUX2SW", "B00AEFXGAW", "B000LV6OC6", "B002M2T1V8", "B009AVCA6W", "B00KE3B8HC", "B004SIP7S0", "B00003CXRG", "B0042EJDGM", "B001MWBK6I", "B0032AJVE6", "B003R9IET0", "B00000F7E6", "B005Q4CKLC", "B00AZMFKXK", "B000274TLW", "B00432M43C", "B000H0M4AW", "B002BWP3UC", "B004PKNYK4", "B0004Z32NI", "B0007NBJHI", "B00E1S1MMM", "1572526599", "B0047685T6", "B0051T46YG", "B0000TPA56", "B0015ET3YO", "B000WC38IC", "B000OVLBGC", "B00JV0547O", "B002BWP3UM", "B001QX014A", "B000LXHFMW", "B00000F5KH", "B002BWP4A6", "B000N3SU6K", "B001R4XRLC", "B004DF3S84", "B000A7Q1O2", "B00112S8RS", "B00GHH9HJA", "B00075VX2C", "B00000G02H", "B001M9ELV2", "B00004RJ71", "B0036TGSJO", "B001M5BF7Y", "B00000F3CD", "B0001CNQX0", "B00003CWTI", "B000M7Y4S0", "B000QXDCLK", "B00003CWSX", "B0001VO38S", "B0002VEZ3U", "B000067IZ3", "B002QFYJF4", "B000N3T0DM", "B000NA6C2M", "B0000A2ZTY", "B001MYIXAC"], "bought_together": ["B00005JL57", "B000N3T0DW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0041KKYF6", "B0002TT0MI", "B002FHGESI", "B000O76ZQC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23708}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.12, "brand": "LION&#39;S GATE ENTERTAINMENT", "asin": "B00005N8A9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X0QYZB1NL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Amores Perros"}

{"description": "To createRobotech(1985), the early sci-fi epic that helped to  foster an audience for Japanese animation in America, producers at  Harmony Gold edited together three unrelated series:Super  Dimension Fortress: Macross,Genesis Climber Mospeada, andSuper Dimensional Cavalry Southern Cross.  \"Dana's Story,\" which begins theRobotech Masters(Southern Cross) adventure, opens 15 years after the previous episode ended. The daughter of Earthling Max Sterling and Zentraedi pilot Miriya (who married in episode 25), spunky Dana Sterling quickly becomes a squadron commander during the Second Robotech War. Serving with her are brooding musician Bowie Grant, corps Casanova Sean Philips, and no-nonsense Marie Crystal. The Robotech Masters attack Earth, hoping to recapture the mysterious Protoculture factory, which was hidden in the flying fortress SDF-1 centuries earlier: they need the Protoculture to maintain control over their oligarchic civilization. But the Masters cannot control Zor Prime, a clone of the inventor of Protoculture, whom Dana captures. This interplanetary struggle is complicated by the mutual attraction between Bowie and the alien Musica, \"the Mistress of the Cosmic Harp.\" TheRobotech Mastersstory line is as convoluted as theMacrosscontinuity, the pacing as slow and the dialogue as wooden. American viewers either love or hateRobotech, with little middle ground.

{"description": "Based on amangaby Kosuke Fujishima,Oh My Goddess!was made into a popular five-part OAV in 1993-94. Keiichi Morisato acquired the goddess Belldandy as a girlfriend in a charming, small-scale domestic comedy. The feature (2000) is set three years later: Keiichi has grown more attractive and less maladroit. Belldandy remains essentially unchanged--until she encounters Celestin, her former \"mentor.\" Celestin rebelled against the powers of Heaven and was imprisoned. Having escaped, he wants to resume his rebellion and reformulate the universe according to his designs. The filmmakers attempt to link computer viruses with apocalyptic mythology and the relationship between Belldandy and Keiichi. Although they made an agreeably mismatched couple in the OAVs, Keiichi and Belldandy simply don't have enough depth as characters to challenge what amounts to a Lucifer figure or support such a baroque story line.

{"description": "Sean Bean has yet to star in a major movie, but he proves his charisma inBravo Two Zero, based on the true story of a British Special Forces unit behind enemy lines during the Gulf War.Bravo Two Zerobegins with the men taking leave of their wives, children, and girlfriends, then takes us step by step through the procedures that lead to going to war: not simply the gathering of equipment and intelligence, but things like \"proof of life\" statements--something idiosyncratic that, if the soldiers are captured, will demonstrate that they are still alive.

Piccolo appears as a Nameck ex machina to aid Gohan, but the centerpiece of the film is the battle between Goku in his Super-Saiyan form and Cooler, who looks like a purple iguana in a football uniform.

{"description": "Sarah Jessica Parker and Harry Connick Jr. star in this oddly sunny attempt at black comedy. (And yes, it stoops to Dick jokes.) Parker plays Colleen, a good girl with a bad boyfriend named Dick. This problem is solved when she kills him within the film's first few moments. The rest of the movie is filled with wackiness, some of which hits and some of which misses. The plot isn't a bad one, with bits of information cleverly revealed through flashbacks and at least one pretty good twist, and the terrific (and sadly underused) Teri Garr appears in a cameo that she could do standing on her head.Life Without Dickis best suited for Harry Connick Jr. fans, as he spends most of the movie being affably handsome, and the other characters repeatedly beg him to sing.

{"description": "This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. As its ratings following the tragic events of September 11, 2001, illustrated,Friendshas matured into television's most beloved comfort show. The peerless ensemble--Jennifer Aniston, a pre-Arquette Courtney Cox, Emmy winner Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, and David Schwimmer--makes a lasting first impression in the first season's 24 episodes, which are presented chronologically on four discs. The perky \"Pilot\" introduces unlucky-in-love Monica, runaway bride Rachel, sad sack Ross, New Age ditz Phoebe, wise guy Chandler, and womanizer Joey. The focus of the first season is Ross's unrequited love for Rachel, but we have these moments to remember: the arrival of Marcel the monkey (\"The One with the Monkey\"); Monica, Rachel, and Phoebe's \"cleansing ritual\" (\"The One with the Candy Hearts\"); the escalating game of shower peek-a-boo (\"The One with the Boobies\"); Joey as Al Pacino's butt double (\"The One with the Butt\"); Ross taking lessons from Joey in how to \"talk dirty\" (\"The One with the Stoned Guy\"); former \"Must-See TV\" stars Helen Hunt and George Clooney (\"The One with Two Parts\"); and Chandler spilling the beans to Rachel about Ross's feelings for her (\"The One Where Rachel Finds Out\"). Though its devoted fans can recite these episodes chapter and verse,Friendsmaintains its sparkle through repeat viewings, a testament to the sharp writing as well as the cast's lightning-in-a-bottle chemistry and lived-in performances. The episodes are presented uncut and extended, with previously unseen dialogue and scenes. And those who hateFriendsand would like to drown the characters in the opening credits' fountain are directed to the episode \"The One with the Boobies,\" in which guest star Fisher Stevens hilariously nails the \"dysfunctional group dynamic ... co-dependent, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffeehouse and you're all like, 'Define me, define me.'\" Among the set's special features are an informative \"Pilot\" episode commentary by the show's creators, who at one point reveal that Monica was originally conceived as a Janeane Garafalo type (how's that for a road not traveled?). More obsessed fans can take a virtual tour of coffee shop Central Perk, the center of theFriendsuniverse, or match wits with the \"How Well Do You Know Your Friends?\" trivia quiz.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000068CNX", "B0000844MI", "B003TNW04Y", "B0000C2IXN", "B003TNW030", "B0006ZM8M2", "B003TNW03K", "B0001AW066", "B003TNW03A", "B005IA9JQ8", "B005IA9JQI", "B005IA9JRM", "B005IA9JSG", "B00005JLEX", "B005MG8UNG", "B00020HAWY", "B000HT3P7E", "B00B1LKXPY", "B008L0YMZA", "B0009VBTP0", "B008L0YN18", "B000TM1CKQ", "B000W91RUG", "B003SNJO5S", "B00005JO9J", "B000ERVK5S", "B0001BS3IY", "B00B04NJ1M", "B002N5N4M6", "B00009Y3RW", "B000NOKFH6", "B00B04NII6", "B00IVLRA62", "B0019CSXAM", "B002N5N4FS", "B0000E32X2", "B001BNFR6M", "B0058JEHTS", "B00005JLIC", "B0002UE1WQ", "B0024FAR6Q", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B00008AOX3", "B00382S9SW", "B00008NV4G", "B0058J3S16", "B0002I838Q", "B000RF1QE2", "B000GETTKM", "B000YA82GA", "B0024FAD8I", "B002BJGYTY", "B001VPJYZ0", "B007C8RZL0", "B003R0MF3A", "B003SNJXMC", "B0000CGNEC", "0792845773", "B0007YXRCW", "B004GJYRFA", "B001A4VH2U", "B0019Z3P84", "B003L77GDS", "B002WC89WK", "B00005JNOG", "B007C8RZQ0", "B000SINT4S", "B00004RFCM", "B0015I2S74", "B00382S9UA", "B0030VANIU", "B008LCRAFC", "B002JVWR7M", "B007C8RZJW", "B006JSXYPA", "B008KZX7W0", "B000R9YLKY", "B005GT3XD6", "B002JVWQSW", "6305428034", "B000HT3P6U", "B00133QNS6", "B00AG473GE", "B000QFCD7W", "B00382S9U0", "B00382S9TQ", "B000WQWPRS", "B0032UYFAQ", "B008LCRA98", "B006WZIB1C", "B003Y5H574", "B00FRILRW0", "B00AEFYM2S", "B000BOH98G", "B0038N9X3Q", "B003L77GE2", "B00133QNSG", "B003VTKZA2", "B002DPPH6W", "B0058JEHSO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005IA9JVI", "B005IA9JQ8", "B00B1LN8WY", "B000068CNX"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 48009}, "asin": "B00005YU81", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HRCAPXNAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Friends: Season 1"}

{"description": "Amateur sleuth extraordinaire Lord Peter Wimsey first meets the lovely Harriet Vane in this clever mystery. At the start ofStrong PoisonHarriet (Harriet Walter) is on trial for murder. Lord Peter (Edward Petherbridge) becomes enchanted by her and decides she cannot possibly be guilty. What follows are the twin stories of Lord Peter's search to find the real killer and his romantic pursuit of Harriet. Both are charming. As always, Sayers has plotted her story brilliantly, with a satisfying mystery and a sly comic touch (a gentle poke at the spiritualist movement is particularly fun). The period atmosphere is pulled off naturally and with close attention to detail, and the adaptation has a careful reverence for Sayers's novel. The performances are all remarkably strong. Both leads capture the peculiar romance of sharp minds quite well, and Richard Morant is quietly fantastic as the remarkable Bunting.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000062XDZ", "B000062XE0", "B00JJRLFTU", "B000068UE9", "B009DS6YGO", "B002TY78PU", "B000062XDX", "B00A8KJLPM", "B008645ZXY", "B005SH65S6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000062XDX", "B000062XDZ", "B00BDSRM4K", "B009DS6YGO"]}, "price": 42.86, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 299448}, "asin": "B000062XDY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5152KH81VGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dorothy L.

{"description": "The first episodes ofI Love Lucy, in comedy terms, look today like a promising map of great things to come from the hugely influential sitcom.  This set of episodes, the first volume in a definitive collection of the classic television series, includes the original three broadcast episodes from October 1951, plus the so-called \"Lost Pilot\" that finds the earliestI Love Lucyproduction quite rough but genuinely promising. The actual episodes that American audiences first saw--\"The Girls Want to Go to a Nightclub,\" \"Be a  Pal,\" and \"The Diet\"--find familiar elements of the classic series already in place. Housewife Lucy (Lucille Ball), restless for excitement, is married to Cuban bandleader Ricky Ricardo (Desi Arnaz). Ricky's crazy nightclub career, however, leaves him yearning for a quiet home life and a wife content with her simple chores. Alas, it's not to be. With best friends Ethel (Vivian Vance) and Fred (William Frawley) usually aboard for the Ricardos' misadventures,I Love Lucyintroduced an engaging blend of sophistication and slapstick, all wrapped in the intimacy of a three-camera TV approach.

In the mid-1930s,Ecstasywas a great conversation piece, for its scandalous acknowledgment of sexual passion in women and its revelation of the naked form of actress Hedy Kiesler, who would become the Hollywood star Hedy Lamarr.Henry Millereven wrote an excited essay about it, sure proof that something libidinous was loose. Czech director Gustav Machat&#xFD; constructs the movie as an almost wordless shadow play of symbols and signs, mostly sexual (there are many close-ups of heavy-breathing horses and nude statues, cut together for maximum erotic impact). As precious as some of these things seem now, it's still amazing to consider Machat&#xFD;'s nerve in depicting one of the first orgasms to hit the movies. And then there's Hedy, whose expressive eyes matter more than her brief skinny-dip.

{"description": "The DVD set of theBack to the Futuretrilogy is as classy and  professional as the series. Both new and original materials are included in the  plethora of extras, starting with two sets of making-of documentaries. Each disc  has material on that particular film, and some features look at the trilogy as a  whole. Producer-writer Bob Gale is the star of the extra features, candidly  presenting the original ideas and many deleted scenes (a few with doses of crude  humor). Much of the inside stuff is repeated in the various pieces, but that's  to be expected with such exhaustive materials. Michael J. Fox chimes in with a  video commentary presented in a picture-in-picture format (which would have  worked better as a straight interview) and the producers tackle the main  commentary track, but the highlight audio commentary is a free-flowing Q&A; with  Gale and director Robert Zemeckis in front of a USC film-school audience.

{"description": "The second part of Yves Robert's filming of Marcel Pagnol's childhood memoirs completes the narrative so casually begun inMy Father's Glory--and fulfills a radiant journey we hadn't even realized we'd embarked on. Marcel is approaching his teens and acquiring a more coherent sense of the world. Accordingly,My Mother's Castleboasts a more concentrated style and unspools its story over (mostly) the space of one year, as opposed to a dozen. Whereas in the first film Robert had worked entirely with little-known players who simplybecameMarcel's family, here he calls upon screen veterans Jean Rochefort, Jean Carmet, and Georges Wilson to flesh out sharply ironical figures who loom challengingly on the young man's horizon. Consistent with Pagnol's emphasis on Proven&#xE7;al locations, the focal event of the film becomes the weekly walk the Marseilles-based family makes from the trolley station to their remote country cottage--a quintessentially mundane ritual that comes to be fraught with wonder, delight, and terror. It all leads to a payoff that opens the meaning of the title only as the film is reaching its transcendent conclusion.--Richard T.

{"description": "The Best Arbuckle/Keaton Collectionliterally defines the phenomenon of genius in the making. While showcasing the formidable slapstick talents of Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle as director and star, this 12-title compilation is also a remarkable study of Buster Keaton's rapid evolution as a silent comedy master. Made in swift succession from 1917 to 1919, these chronologically sequenced two-reelers serve a dual purpose, re-establishing Arbuckle as an underrated talent (his career was tragically curtailed by an infamous rape scandal, despite his eventual exoneration), while crediting his mentorship of Keaton from Vaudeville veteran to inspired movie pioneer. The \"Great Stone Face\" had yet to emerge (though it's evident in Keaton's 1917 debut, \"The Butcher Boy\"), so Buster's innately amusing countenance is wondrously animated here, especially in \"Coney Island,\" which doubles as an illustrious postcard from a bygone era. The final collaboration, \"The Garage,\" was Buster's favorite, and it's easy to see why: with a giant turntable, fire hoses, grease buckets, and all varieties of gag-laden shtick, it's a sublime (and like most of these films, well-preserved) example of two gifted comedians at the peak of their craft.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00097DXG2", "B00049QQ78", "B000A7DVMM", "B000E1EHQI", "B004XEEMA8", "B00007L4MK", "B003H221M8", "B0002HOEJY", "B0082CDGSG", "0306801787", "B007AAEZ7W", "0810942275", "B009CSVQB8", "B00652FG38", "B002TCRQNG", "B0041CGOZ8", "B00JRHW4GK", "B001FD6MJO", "B00652FG60", "1497372755", "B00652FG4M", "B00J84NGBE", "B000WC8CLU", "B000F4TMIW", "B005SDB8H8", "B001E18222", "B004IMDCK6", "B00IPAORL0", "B008BWFOXC", "B00D8HNRBG", "B005DKS1W6", "189166106X", "1578069637", "B00005QW5A", "B002A2B348", "B00D9BNOKK", "B00FNRA7VW", "B0097RU0LG", "B0016A2FHE", "6305701245", "076365079X", "B0040QYROA", "B00AIA89ZA", "B00005ALM3", "B003YBNNMY", "B000LC4C0Q", "B00ARKYSWE", "B003H221MI", "B00A1AU6VM", "B000E6ESX0", "B000B5XORA", "B00D2CRP42", "B005IA9JWW", "B00004Z4W3", "1557046646", "B004XEEMAI", "B00005ALM4", "B00009Q4VX", "B001O2UTRW", "B001M9ELJY", "B00005O5CD", "0810876825", "B002NTDX6O", "B005BYBZKY", "0312496958", "B00ALTQRUC", "B00GBT61YS", "B00BF36ZXC", "B000E5LC58", "B004HI4RYG", "B000021Y7O", "B0056HTEKO", "057121276X", "B000AM4PJK", "0691004420", "B00000JWWZ", "B000056N7W", "B0002CHIDS", "0806513039", "B00009XN8Y", "0306803879", "B004YOEGA8", "B0031REQHM", "B0006GAONG", "0786477113", "B000AM4PJ0", "B004YOECXY", "B000XA5K0M", "B000A59QJ6", "B000KGH0DO", "B001GOEYAG", "B00AOCDE7U", "B003Y7F1QE", "6305211264", "B0013XZ6R0", "0025115707", "B004ASDNP2", "B007UQ8ISI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00097DXG2", "B004XEEMA8", "B000E1EHQI", "B001FD6MJO"]}, "price": 18.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 191951}, "asin": "B00006IUIU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51hAcdRvi6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Best Arbuckle/Keaton Collection"}
{"description": "The four-part OAVDoomed Megalopolis(1991) is more notable for its  misogynistic violence than for its coherent storytelling or skillful animation. In  1908 the ghost-demon-sorcerer Kato tries to resurrect Masakado, a  historical figure who has become the unofficial guardian deity of Tokyo, by  offering Yukari as a human sacrifice. Masakado rejects Kato's offering, but  the evil sorcerer keeps trying, tormenting Yukari and her daughter, Yukiko  (whose father is Yukari's brother Tatsumi). Kato causes the devastating 1923  Tokyo earthquake at the end of episode 2, after which the plot simply  collapses. Violent imagery--collapsing buildings, the repeated rape and torture  of Yukari--alternate with stretches of leaden dialogue, long  Morris-the-Explainer scenes, and pretentious narration.

{"description": "The most sullied figure of the American Revolution receives partial redemption inBenedict Arnold: A Question of Honor. Produced for the A&E; network, this factual drama reveals the lesser-known circumstances of Arnold's dishonor, beginning in 1777 and chronicling his fall from greatness. The conquering hero of Saratoga and other victories of the Revolution finds himself in an impossible predicament, his allegiance torn between his British loyalist wife (Jane Brennan) and his paternally devoted commander, George Washington (Kelsey Grammer), as his Colonial detractors cast him into a tragic no-win scenario. Authentically detailed and blessed by playwright William Mastrosimone's poetic period dialogue,Benedict Arnoldsuccessfully explores the personalandpolitical facets of a great soldier's downfall. Aidan Quinn's expressive melancholy perfectly suits his title role, and Grammer transcendsFrasier, lending appropriate gravitas--and some physical resemblance--to his portrayal of America's future president. Like A&E;'s earlier filmThe Crossing, this is compelling historical drama, entertaining, intelligent, and emotionally complex.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00007GZYC", "B009OE2O70", "B001TK80D4", "B0052SO0OW", "B004MCGNVM", "B0007PALM0", "B000BITU3E", "B000E1MXZ0", "B005QW98AK", "B00005JM6F", "B007TSV4IS", "B0013NAML0", "B000BNX4N6", "B00022Z06K", "B000G1R402", "B00005U8F4", "B00028G75C", "B00004XPPG", "B000JU7JE6", "B000WGWQG8", "B000067D1R", "B005DJ7B2I", "B000BITUJS", "B000BITU3O", "B00A92MCNW", "B00006AUK1", "B00008IOWU", "B000742G0G", "B0095ZIHZ6", "B004LWZVZC", "B000EOTUSA", "B000XNZ7KM", "B007TBKAXK", "B00BIPPP6U", "B0002DRDBY", "B004Z2ECX0", "B000E1E2N6", "1402269676", "B006QVRWD0", "B009D4H08Y", "0783231202", "B0000687BM", "B000WMA73G", "B00005B6OY", "B00009OOFA", "B000EMGF2Q", "B000HWZ4CA", "B00BAXTY7G", "1573623903", "B00062IDBU", "B004TPJMWY", "1451659261", "B005DKS1TE", "B0007GP836", "B009INAI02", "B00EZBC9GI", "B000NOIVT0", "B004UOHNIY", "B000A8AXXG", "B002AMUDJY", "B00004U2K1", "B000B6H1YG", "B001FZQOOU", "B00C2535TE", "B008XAT0TQ", "B001ARDC16", "B002CWKTUA", "B007TBIUSM", "B000VEG252", "B00006RCO3", "B00008DDGW", "B000E3719Q", "1250024609", "B007PXYWNQ", "B002DHACT2", "B00005JMLR", "B000RPCK1K", "B00B4ZN3XQ", "B001BNFRB2", "0345527364", "B0006213I0", "B0021PAMIC"], "bought_together": ["B00007GZYC", "B009OE2O70"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00007GZYC", "B009OE2O70", "B0052SO0OW", "B001E77XN0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 55622}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 16.49, "brand": "", "asin": "B00007CVRF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51p73A2FCGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Benedict Arnold - A Question of Honor"}

{"description": "It was a short but sweet fifth season forSex and the City, as HBO's resident comediennes found themselves affected by forces beyond their control--the pregnancies of both Sarah Jessica Parker (Carrie) and Cynthia Nixon (Miranda). A truncated shooting schedule to accommodate the actresses forced this season to be reduced to a mere eight episodes, and indeed, you can tell both actresses are expecting. (Carrie's wardrobe became more outlandish and more concealing than usual.) Still, the actresses and creators forged ahead, creating a handful of episodes that if short in content were long on emotion and laughs. Whereas the fourth season found all four grappling with various relationships, the fifth season focused on the perils of being single, with a new intensity lacking in the previous sexcapades. Carrie and Miranda wrestled with their solitary lifestyles, albeit with new attachments--Miranda had new baby Brady and single motherhood, while Carrie found herself in the world of publishing as the author of a real-life book of her columns. Charlotte (Kristin Davis) wondered if she'd ever find another man, while Samantha (Kim Cattrall) finally got rid of the one that had been vexing her far too much, hotelier Richard (James Remar). If the season as a whole felt less than the sum of its parts, those parts were some of the best comedy in the show's history, from Samantha's anointment as the \"Michiko Kakutani of vibrators\" to Carrie's stressful, one-degree-from-fiasco book launch party. (And fear not, Chris Noth's Mr. Big does pop up now and again.) The season's climactic episode, \"I Love a Charade,\" found all four at the straight wedding of a seemingly gay pal (Nathan Lane) and contemplating their future with a wry, bemused tone. It was one of the series' best episodes ever, equally touching and funny, and grounded the show in an emotional maturity that announced that after all their wild travails, these women had truly grown up.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00382S9U0", "B00382S9UA", "B00382S9T6", "B00382S9SW", "B00382S9SM", "B00AYVDUPW", "B00004RFCM", "B00005AVCA", "B001DDBCUA", "B002ZG98Z0", "B006WZIB1C", "B00AQ5RRJQ", "B001675YWK", "B0002SDY1W", "B005IFIUEU", "B00AS870P2", "B0013FSL16", "B00IKX4LEK", "B001PQZYQI", "B002ZG98ZA", "0743457307", "B00079FUI6", "0446617687", "B001DDBCV4", "B002PJ4HNK", "B001675YW0", "B000P6YNTI", "B000FIMG4U", "B0018CWEYO", "B001VPJYZK", "B001VPJZ0O", "B0001CCXZW", "B003F3NE1Q", "B003CN5SAY", "B00D8H3LR6", "B002BJGYTO", "B00DRSGQ7I", "B002BJGYU8", "B004EPYZRG", "B002BJGYV2", "B005IA9JRM", "B003L77GFG", "B0077PTWHI", "B000069HYG", "B0000844MI", "B004SEUJK0", "B000G1R3A8", "B00BUWD7Y8", "B0018CWEXK", "B002YBUX0K", "B005IA9JQI", "B000EMGJ7C", "B0006SGYM4", "B002VWNIBI", "B00005JMYI", "B00I458456", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00466HN7M", "B00A81MV3U", "B005LAIIHG", "B0000DIXDR", "B002K0WBXW"], "bought_together": ["B00382S9U0", "B00382S9UA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00382S9SM", "B00004RFCM", "B00382S9SW", "B00382S9T6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 53385}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 17.89, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00008PW2D", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ps3SLLDZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sex and the City: Season 5"}
{"description": "The second and last season ofDark Angel, the inventive James Cameron show about mutants during a future Depression, has some real strengths as well as one or two bad ideas that partly explain its much-regretted cancellation. Among the strengths are Alec (Jensen Ackles), the thoroughly unreliable mutant charmer whose flirtations with heroine Max (Jessica Alba) complicate her doomed love for Logan (Michael Weatherly), the crippled newshound whom she cannot now even touch--she has been infected with a deadly virus tailored specifically to kill him. The distrust this sows between the doomed couple does not always avoid soap-opera clich&eacute;s, but often produces fine performances from all three, especially Alba.On the deficit side, John Savage's memorably ambiguous villain Lydeker fromseason 1(who is alternately the mutants' nemesis and their protector) disappears to be replaced by the melodramatically sinister Agent White (Martin Cummins). White appears to be just a shoot-to-kill operative of the state and turns out to be another sort of superhuman, a product of an occultist breeding program going back to the dawn of history. After White's first ruthless killing, Max's reluctance to use deadly force is tested to near-implausible limits. The show ends with a rousing and moving finale, \"Freak Nation\", in which a theme often neglected in this final year--Max's relationship with her fellow couriers at Jam Pony--reaches a powerful climax.--Roz Kaveney", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000O77SMW", "B00191AEYQ", "B00170LCWC", "B000AO9BSS", "B0024FAR66", "B002JVWR4U", "B0002XVKMM", "B000SMNL92", "B00083FZGI", "0345451821", "B004CWLRF4", "0345451848", "034545183X", "B001MVWRMU", "B001MVWRN4", "B001MVWRNO", "B001MVWRNE", "B001MVWRMK", "B0020PFYHC", "B00133QNS6", "B004YPED14", "B0012IX35S", "B0009JE6FM", "B00133QNSG", "B00133QNRW", "B00HUPC5X8", "B00BHLTIXQ", "0061370908", "B000C65Z8Y", "B00007LB4B", "B005FISC3Y", "B00B4804LM", "B00FEVZDC0", "B00008ZL4Q", "1848565283", "B00IWTVDUW", "B0009A5MUO", "B002N5N5MK", "B0047BXR8U", "B009LDCXNY", "B003U6SJY0", "1783202033", "B000WTZ6SK", "B00H57HOSC", "B00KS9V6EC", "1845765354", "0345451856", "B001BN4WL8", "B000QUEQ4U", "B006YG9HJE", "160938198X", "B003KW7CQ0", "B00441GYVA", "B007H9CNOI", "1781161119", "B0038MUZ3E", "B0009JE6G6", "B0024FAD9C", "B006LG74Q0", "B000EHSVN2", "1608871452", "B003L77GWE", "B000EHSVM8", "B008I34YOO", "B0007DA3V6", "B001CQONMC", "B000EHSVMS", "B001FB4W0C", "B000X5SPBI", "B005UL4NH0", "B000NOKFGW", "B001ILFUB4", "184856600X", "B0090F6SD4", "1848561032", "B000I0QLR8", "B0031DDG9A", "B002QU1Z1K", "B002JVWR54", "B000BOH8Y6", "B003R0MEYA", "B000BTIU4S", "B000FJH5MC", "B0010YSD7M", "B00HUPC5UG", "B0010TDRP0", "B0047BXR30", "B003YF9Q08", "B004XM38CS", "B00GTZWUPS", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B004KPLVXG", "B008JFUS0U", "085768289X", "1781161089", "B003MX91H0", "B0006FO9B0", "1781161127", "B00344EAQO", "B00077BPA0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000O77SMW", "B00170LCWC", "B00152R4VK", "B00083FZGI"]}, "price": 18.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 75133}, "asin": "B00008YGRX", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EZHNQ4QPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dark Angel Season 2"}

{"description": "Depression-era Hollywood produced a slew of movies about sympathetic criminals victimized by an unfeeling society. No other has the power of Fritz Lang'sYou Only Live Once, the director's second American film and a masterpiece of fatalism. Henry Fonda is the convict released to a new life (encouraged to go straight, he growls, \"I will if they let me\"--not a hopeful note); Sylvia Sidney is his new bride, convinced of his essential goodness. Their homely dreams are crushed by a hostile world, which Lang's scrupulously controlled direction turns into a series of dead ends. In particular, the last half of the picture--a prison break and cross-country ramble inspired by Bonnie and Clyde--is an exceptionally intense downward spiral, swift with predestined momentum. While Fonda and Sidney are unforgettable in their echt-Thirties forms, Lang is the star, proving the director ofMandMetropolishad lost none of his edge.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AQ6J5YA", "B0007TKNHY", "B001SMC9L2", "B000BGH2N6", "B00004RER5", "B009RWRINE", "B0089LT800", "B0024FAG8A", "B004VA0R7Q", "B002945DUW", "B00005RDRL", "B0001UZZS6", "B00I9BU49Y", "B00BM4Q4PI", "B00CVB6XF2", "B0001FVDT6", "B00065GX64", "6305999872", "B0087ZG7OI", "B00064AEWY", "B002MZZUGK", "B000087F79", "B004C2523M", "B00EL6A7XE", "B000BGH2NG", "B00BGARG3C", "B00E18QKJ2", "B000QXDFS0", "B003ZEQMH8", "B00DZP1BVO", "B0006Z2NDQ", "B00004Z4VE", "B00DBE97GK", "B000PMFRW4", "B0012GVMIK", "B0024FAG80", "B00IJE19OA", "B002YNQEF6", "B0006TPDZC", "B0080JG2GE", "B009X919UE", "B00007ELD1", "B00012L786", "B00023P4GA", "B003552QWM", "B002ZG4Q66", "B0040QYROA", "B000N3T0H8", "B000PKG7DE", "B000KJTGFG", "B000244EX8", "B0006TPDZ2", "B00AB2NX4M", "B000EXDSBG", "B0000549B1", "B008NNSDSC", "B0099VUWEA", "B00DZP1C9K", "B009FAVM8U", "B0039UU3IM", "B0085A9JE0", "B005QBET8C", "B005EXA8Z0", "B0088XQDI4", "B000O75VBM", "B0000C2IVE", "B000BT96IW", "B000PMFRVA", "B0078G9RMQ", "B00008PX7G", "B005KR6NY0", "6305950687", "B0078SKN9K", "B001PT6YGY"], "bought_together": ["B0007TKNHY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AQ6J5YA", "B0007TKNHY", "B009X919UE", "B000PMFRW4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 184701}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 39.99, "brand": "Image Entertainment", "asin": "B000093NTA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51wN%2Bo36eqL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "You Only Live Once"}

{"description": "Twelve-year-old Misaka Suzuhara arrives in Tokyo from the country to attend  middle school, and is immediately drawn to \"Angelic Layer,\" a battle game  played with animated dolls. Under the skewed tutelage of \"Mr. Icchan,\" Misaka  assembles her doll Hiraku, begins playing, and immediately wins. Although she never  does any school work, Misaka befriends kindergartener Hatoko, her older  brother Kotaro, and his rambunctious friend Tamayo. Not surprisingly, all their  socializing revolves around the \"Angelic Layer\" game. This 2001 broadcast series  plays like a mixture ofPok&#xE9;monandChobits. Both the original  manga and the animation are by Clamp Studio, and typify their unremittingly cute  style: the character designs suggestCardcaptor Sakura, but without  any mischief to leaven the sugar. Icchan approaching Misaka and her  unquestioningly following him may strike American viewers as distinctly creepy.

{"description": "Based on a popular manga by Kentaro Muira,Berserk(1997) presents a dark, gritty vision of medieval warfare that sets it apart from run-of-the-mill chivalric tales. Guts is a brooding warrior, haunted by internal and external demons, who fights with an enormous two-handed sword. When he's defeated in hand-to-hand combat by the elegant Griffith, Guts joins The Band of the Hawk, his elite mercenary corps. Although he presents himself as a pure idealist, Griffith uses kidnapping, prostitution, and murder to advance his standing in the Kingdom of Midland during its protracted war with Chuder. But when Griffith rashly seduces Princess Charlotte of Midland, the King imprisons him and decimates the Hawks. After spending a year training with a master sword-smith, Guts rejoins the remaining White Hawks to rescue Griffith, but the torture master has mutilated him so horribly, he can no longer command his followers. When he finds the Egg of the King gem, all hell breaks loose--literally. Griffith chose a violent destiny that culminates in his transformation into a demon-prince, and the White Hawks are devoured by misshapen creatures from the nether world. The grisly ending doesn't fit the rest of the story: what began as a violent but powerful tale of loyalty and valor collapses into a bloody gore-fest that recallsLegend of the Overfiend.

{"description": "The third time's the, for want of a better word, charm forSouth Parkon DVD. Instead of mere episode intros as on the first two boxed sets, Trey Parker and Matt Stone finally oblige us with actual episode commentary, or, as they call it, \"commentary-mini.\" On this optional audio track, Trey and Matt goof for about five minutes or so at the top of each episode, certifying some as favorites (\"Tweek vs. Craig,\" \"Jewbilee,\" and \"Worldwide Recorder Concert,\" which is described as \"a reverse after-school special from hell\"), championing others popularly dismissed bySouth Park's otherwise loyal fans (\"Jakovasaurs,\" \"Sexual Harassment Panda\"), and provocatively dismissing all ofseason 2.The third season was frantically produced simultaneously with the feature film,South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut. This was the season, Trey proclaims, \"whereSouth Parkturned the corner... and became good (as far as we were concerned).\" Among their most inspired conceits is the so-called \"Meteor Shower Party\" trilogy, three episodes that unfold over the course of one night, each focusing on a different kid. \"Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery\" pays homage to Hanna-Barbera-style animation andScooby-Doo, recasting Korn as the Mystery Inc gang. \"Rainforest Shmainforest,\" featuring a game Jennifer Aniston, cuts rainforest crusaders down to size. \"Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics\" takes its irreverent cue from thealbum of the same name, and contains an outrageously obscure reference to the 1978 made-for-TVStar Wars Holiday Special. Throughout the season,South Parkis, as usual, a gleeful equal-opportunity offender, but the show's true gonzo spirit is truly illustrated in such surreal touches as the employment of live action in \"Tweek vs. Craig,\" the singing of \"The Morning After\" backwards to save Chef from the spell of \"The Succubus,\" and theSeinfeld-worthy argument over whether the term should be \"pirate ghosts\" or \"ghost pirates\" in \"Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery.\"--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00023P49M", "B0001ZWLVU", "B00023P49C", "B0006Z2L2Y", "B000ADWCYY", "B000CNESM6", "B000FSME2Y", "B000KLQUMQ", "B000R7I3XC", "B0018O5WUU", "B001O0TWXG", "B0030Y11UG", "B004MLEYTG", "B006W93ELK", "B009SQ9Q5M", "B000USUA8E", "B000022TSW", "B000LW7OKQ", "B00AEBB8TM", "B001O0TWXQ", "B000ZT0S9O", "B00105308I", "B006W93EM4", "B0030Y11NS", "B004MLEYT6", "B009SQ9Y7M", "B000OPO0LQ", "B008412UKA", "B00008YGRV", "B0000AQS81", "B000AQ68Z0", "B0012018OE", "B000E6ES9O", "B003VJTGKW", "B000083C6V", "B003DZX46G", "B0001MZ7KA", "B000HT3P6U", "B000RO6JZO", "0762435615", "B001CQONKO", "B009WSJHD2", "B000UAE7UE", "B00G4RCB14", "B001VFM0ZG", "B006IOAHTQ", "B0002XVQT4", "B000E0OE3K", "B000NNK4DM", "B00008YGRS", "B007ZFR67I", "B003L77G7Y", "B0007PAM06", "B000P2A6CA", "B007KFZ8AA", "B00G4RCF60", "B000067DNE", "B00LBHOCHS", "B000B5XOR0", "6305301700", "B007KFZ7YM", "B00CJEKA2I", "B0002WZRSG", "030789682X", "B00008YGRZ", "B000F9T700", "B003W5TO70", "B00005JM3G", "B001RIZ7OI", "B007KFZ85K", "B003CN5B7E", "B001G0MFFG", "B00C28X8IY", "B00000J8BV", "B0002NY8XA", "B007KFZ88M", "B00AEFZ8OY", "B0012KSUTA", "B00002RAO2", "B00330WP6Q", "B000ABKHZC", "B008412UQ4", "B00CJEK7GW", "B007Z3UUF0", "B00E0FW054", "B000GPYMZS", "B006IOAHPK", "B003XJABTK", "B007KFZ7UQ", "B003V3FVQ6", "B004QP7WTC", "B0001LJBTE", "B0007CILMA", "B00K8HAJN8", "B000B5XOWU", "0762435704", "B00003CXS7", "B00H3JJCW8", "B001MT7ZI8"], "bought_together": ["B00023P49M", "B00023P49C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00023P49M", "B00023P49C", "B0006Z2L2Y", "B0001ZWLVU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 16296}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.12, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B0000CABL2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51rGlTEGXrL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "South Park: Season 3"}

{"description": "Alex Bernier (Heath Ledger) is a member of an arcane order of priests who is sent to Rome to investigate the mysterious death of the head of this order. The body may be of a Sin Eater, a renegade who offers absolution, last rites and therefore a path to heaven outside the jurisdiction of the church.

{"description": "Opening with a Dido theme song and featuring character-driven, sweet-natured melodrama,Roswellwas a show with a surprisingly dedicated fandom, who twice won it reprieve from cancellation. One of its main strengths was, of course, the extent to which its premise--alien teenagers trying to sort out their identities while emotionally involved with their human contemporaries--was a free-floating metaphor for race and sexuality issues. Another was the strong ensemble that its cast developed: you believed in the strangeness of the alien trio and the  well-intentioned normality of their three human  friends. Jason Behr gave the alien Max a quiet authority and Majendra Delfino took the sidekick role of Maria and gave it both intensity and fine comic timing. It was also a show in which you were never sure which adults you could trust--William Sadleir trod a fine line of ambiguity as the local sheriff and Julie Benz was silkily sinister as an FBI agent. Anyone who ever loved this show will want these DVDs--and many others may want to find out what the fuss was about.Roswellis presented in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen. The special features include commentaries on six episodes by writer Jason Katims, the directors, and various cast members as well as a featurette on the making of the show and another on its adaptation from the originalRoswell Highseries of young adult novels. The commentaries are unusually insightful on the casting process, and the discs also include the auditions for the part of Tess as well as a deleted scene and a music video.--Roz Kaveney", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00133QNS6", "B00133QNSG", "B000NOKFGW", "B00005YU87", "B001ILFUB4", "B002QZDSW4", "B000O77SMW", "B0002XVKMM", "B000O77SN6", "B000FJH5M2", "B00008AOX3", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B000EHSVKK", "B000092T3Y", "B0000E5NPY", "B00177YA10", "B000AO9BSS", "B00JF5G8WU", "B0002234R2", "B0001907BC", "B000VSDNFA", "B0009A407A", "B0077PTWY6", "B003R0MF6W", "B002BWP2IK", "B00022FWEU", "B000F3UAE8", "B0001IN0T4", "B000FOPPBA", "B001CQONMC", "B0001I55S8", "B0051GOB2G", "B0077PTWHI", "B000YDOOEQ", "B00IWTVDUW", "B00GHH9IAI", "B0009JE6G6", "B000I0QLQY", "B000EAT23C", "B00HQOFAKI", "B000BOH990", "B001MVWRNO", "B002JVWR4U", "B0007V6IW6", "B000I0QLR8", "B002HMTX84", "B00HUPC5X8", "B000BNXD6O", "B00GHH9HBI", "B008X6N8KW", "B0009JE6FC", "B0002RQ3MK", "0671774654", "B001MVWRNE", "B004YPED14", "B003L77GWE", "B0024FAR66", "B0024FAD9C", "B00DPJEWD4", "B00BD6K54G", "B001MVWRMU", "B002CLKP00", "B009LDCWWG", "B000I0QLRI", "B008JFUS0U", "B00JF5GAZA", "B0006J28DW", "0671774662", "B000K7UBX4", "B00BGQ2NIO", "B00005JM39", "B004SMDJ9U", "B000BOH98G", "B0058YPGL6", "B00465I156", "B00127RAGM", "0671774646", "B00BGI086Q", "B00J11U54K", "B006LG74Q0", "B000OCXNQW", "B00GOC74I4", "B001MVWRMK", "B001AQO43M", "B005PPMHO2", "B00466H3CC", "B000EHSVMS", "B000J10KKA", "B000QDLSR0", "B000FIHN8O", "B0012IXBNC", "B00FUABG1C", "B001MVWRN4", "B00166UFTI", "B0011FLGZQ", "B000I0QLS2", "B00005JO9J", "B00ED2IBXE", "B0001JXPPC", "B00AALVINW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00133QNSG", "B000NOKFGW", "B00133QNS6", "B001ILFUB4"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 106839}, "asin": "B0000TPA6K", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TBGR80E9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Roswell - The Complete First Season"}

Gene Hackman plays the ultra-cynical, utterly unscrupulous pawn of the gun-makers, using an expert staff and advanced electronics to hand-pick a New Orleans jury that will return a favorable verdict; Dustin Hoffman (making his first screen appearance with real-life former roommate Hackman) defends the grieving widow of a gun-shooting victim with idealistic zeal, while maverick juror John Cusack and accomplice Rachel Weisz play both ends against the middle in a personal quest to hold gun-makers accountable.

{"description": "TrustThe four-episodeSamurai X: Trustoriginal animation video captures the mixture of swordplay and poetry that makes Japanese warrior culture so intriguing to viewers on both sides of the Pacific. The OAV series serves as a prequel to bothSamurai X: The Movieand the more lighthearted TV series. The action unfolds in 1864, when a few clans began the revolt that would overthrow the military dictatorship of the Tokugawa Shogunate and return power to the Emperor in the Meiji Restoration of 1868. Shinta, a lonely orphan, is transformed by master swordsman Hiko into Kenshin Himura, an assassin in the service of Katsura, one of the revolutionary leaders. Kenshin kills whomever Katsura orders with consummate skill and unshatterable calm. He believes he is using his sword to bring about a better world, even as the intrigues and counter-intrigues escalate. But he becomes aware of unspoken doubts when he meets Tomoe, a mysterious girl whose beauty, like the iris, is seen to best advantage in cloudy weather. Director Kazuhiro Furuhashi choreographs the sword fights with a grace that infuses even scenes of extreme violence with an elegant sensuality: in one striking image, he focuses on the rain washing a spatter of blood from Tomoe's cheek. The dialogue in the English translation often sounds stilted, but the words are usually superfluous.BetrayalThe peace that reigns over the remote mountain village of Otsu contrasts sharply with the rapid-fire violence of the previous episodes set in Kyoto. Working as a farmer, growing crops and savoring the passage of the seasons, Kenshin comes to terms with the discontent festering in his soul. He regrets the death and suffering he has caused, and hopes to find a better life--with the mysterious Tomoe. A conventional story would end on this note of self-discovery and moral growth. ButSamurai Xunfolds like a Kabuki tragedy: the desire for revenge remains strong, especially among the agents of the last Tokugawa Shogun, who are anxious to crush the nascent rebellion led by the Choshu clan. Kenshin was an important agent for the Choshu; Tomoe is just a pawn, but the outcome of a game may hinge on a strategically positioned pawn. Kenshin finally grasps the lessons his master, Hiko, attempted to teach him: the need for inner peace and the possibility of defending the weak without resorting to violence. The exquisitely detailed artwork evokes 19th century Japan, and director Kazuhiro Furuhashi depicts these understated inner conflicts as skillfully as the epic sword fights in the first episodes.Samurai Xdemonstrates the power of animation to present stories of great emotional depth, earning it a rightful place among the top anime series.ReflectionThe final OAV brings the long-running saga of master swordsman and assassin Kenshin Himura to its conclusion. The story is set in 1893, long after the bloody conflicts of the Meiji Restoration--and the events in the previous OAVs that culminated in the death of Kenshin's wife, Tomoe. With his devoted second wife, Kaoru, Kenshin seeks peace in trying to aid the helpless. But he cannot escape the karmic burden of the many deaths he caused: there is no peace for Kenshin in this world. The Japanese concept of the transitory nature of beauty permeates the two-part adventure. Director Kazuhiro Furuhashi ushers the narrative along at a deliberate pace, deftly inserting the many flashback sequences. The result is a properly elegiac farewell to one of most popular anime characters on both sides of the Pacific.

{"description": "An adaptation of the Christopher Marlowe masterpiece,Doctor Faustusallows Richard Burton (who also co-directed) to sink his teeth into one of the great theater roles, with loyal wife Elizabeth Taylor along for the ride. Now, there were a few good movies and many follies born of the epic marriage of Burton and Taylor;Faustusis one of their most curious progeny. Alas, Burton's performance is hardly scaled back from a big, bellowing stage turn, while elsewhere the film fails to work up the most rudimentary cinematic life. And Liz? She keeps appearing, wordlessly, as a sexed-up dream temptation for poor Faustus, and finally as Helen of Troy, of \"Is this the face that launched a thousand ships?\" fame. The only real fun to be had here is wondering whether Burton saw the project as a metaphor for his own career:  a man who sold his soul in return for earthly pleasures... as embodied by Elizabeth Taylor.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AZFECHW", "B0009WFFHM", "B00000JL7T", "B000I2JDFI", "B001RUALEC", "B00K6J7MGK", "B000K2UW4C", "B00KE3B6NI", "B00K6KII6C", "B008H6GHE2", "B001M9ELJY", "B00IJS2OHM", "B005ZVINFS", "B000KHI2FS", "B00IY1T8T6", "B00HGBAG5K", "B004FIYR1G", "B00027JYEY", "B000EBD9TE", "B003Y58CKI", "B00I6JODGO", "B00JPQ1IJM", "B000QGE8IS", "B0045HCJ94", "B0059XTUR2", "0393977544", "B00003CXBZ", "B00004TWZH", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B001LPWGHS", "B006A8XG7U", "B00019072G", "B004M9ZI0M", "B0000714BZ", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00I04SVV8", "1598532952", "B00J2PQZEY", "B00JEZWRE4", "0300180101", "B00005PJ6W", "B000ERVKJY", "B002N37N70", "B000QGE8JC", "B0007WRT4Q", "B000E6ESKS", "B007RP4CAA", "B001TR4G6W", "B002C4ON78", "B00007G1WH", "B0002KPHW4", "B00CDV4JNS", "B0000B1A58", "B00005O3V8", "B000HWZ4AC", "B00BLYCB1K", "B0000AZKO7", "0060790830", "B00DOZNI8Y", "B008BSM1CI", "B004XKVP7K", "B007P7UF0G", "B0000VLLEI", "B001D5F2LI", "B00EI2CUN6", "B000LTY4HA", "157322751X", "B004IFYN38", "B004DK9DQ0", "B00005O06N", "B001SGEUFQ", "B00DQN6IOK", "B0082SICCU", "B00AEFYNG8", "B00ESZZOOK", "B00005JL6M", "B0000DJZ8Q", "B0074JODYY", "B002Q3MYA8", "B007RP4BZ6", "B001KP2J3K", "0767847431", "B00BTYFWE0", "B000E8JO32", "B0044LLO4M", "B000087F6L", "6305557144", "B000O179JK", "B000EHSVB4", "B000ND91WW", "B00007L4MV", "B000BCKFXE", "B000E33W0I", "B003757VX4", "B005FLD3EE", "B000ETRCN0", "B002945DUW", "B00BDZV4OW", "B005FLD3KS", "B00443FMKM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00000JL7T", "B0009WFFHM", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00AZFECHW"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 39598}, "asin": "B00018D3PU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517n-pbGMcL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Doctor Faustus"}
{"description": "Michael Winterbottom's amazingIn This Worldis a docudrama that reportedly re-creates the harrowing journey of two young Afghan males smuggled, one step at a time, from a long-established refugee camp in Pakistan across central Asia to their London destination. Shot with remarkable fluidity and narrative thoroughness in what appears many times to be dangerous situations with border guards and untrustworthy handlers (in Iran, Istanbul, Turkey, and France),In This Worldis anchored by non-actors Jamal Udin Torabi and Enayatullah, playing characters of the same names. The rapid pace and frequent fade-outs in this 88-minute film paradoxically force one's imagination to underscore the agonizing slowness and anxiety of the young men's trip, a technique that becomes nightmarish when Jamal and Enayat are locked for days, with other refugees, inside a ship's container.

{"description": "As upscale sitcoms go,Something's Gotta Givehas more to offer than most romantic comedies. Obviously working through some semi-autobiographical issues regarding \"women of a certain age,\" writer-director Nancy Meyers brings adequate credibility and above-average intelligence to what is essentially (but not exclusively) a fantasy premise, in which an aging lothario who's always dated younger women (Jack Nicholson, more or less playing himself) falls for a successful middle-aged playwright (Diane Keaton) who's convinced she's past the age of romance, much less sexual re-awakening. As long as old pals Nicholson and Keaton are on screen discussing their dilemma or discovering their mutual desire,Something's Gotta Giveis terrific, proving (in case anyone had forgotten) that Hollywood can and should aim for an older demographic. Myers falls short with the sitcom device of a younger lover (Keanu Reeves) who wants Keaton as much as Nicholson does; it's believable but shallow and too easily dismissed. Myers also skimps on supporting roles for Frances McDormand, Amanda Peet, and Jon Favreau, but thankfully this is one romantic comedy that doesn't pander to youth.

{"description": "After one episode ofThe Wireyou'll be hooked. After three, you'll be astonished by the precision of its storytelling. After viewing all 13 episodes of the HBO series' remarkable first season, you'll be cheering a bona-fide American masterpiece. Series creator David Simon was a veteran crime reporter fromThe Baltimore Sunwho cowrote thebookthat inspired TV'sHomicide, and cowriter Ed Burns was a Baltimore cop, lending impeccable street-cred to an inner-city Baltimore saga (and companion piece toThe Corner) that Simon aptly describes as \"a visual novel\" and \"a treatise on institutions and individuals\" as opposed to a conventional good-vs.-evil police procedural. Owing a creative debt to the novels of Richard Price (especiallyClockers), the series opens as maverick Detective Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West, in a star-making role) is tapping into a vast network of drugs and death around southwest Baltimore's deteriorating housing projects. With a mandate to get results ASAP, a haphazard team is assembled to join McNulty's increasingly complex investigation, built upon countless hours of electronic surveillance.The show's split-perspective plotting is so richly layered, so breathtakingly authentic and based on finely drawn characters brought to life by a perfect ensemble cast, that it defies concise description. Simon, Burns, and their cowriters control every intricate aspect of the unfolding epic; directors are top-drawer (including Clark Johnson, helmer ofThe Shield's finest episodes), but they are servants to the story, resulting in a TV series like no other: unpredictable, complicated, and demanding the viewer's rapt attention,The Wireis \"an angry show\" (in Simon's words) that refuses to comfort with easy answers to deep-rooted societal problems. Moral gray zones proliferate in a universe where ruthless killers have a logical code, and where the cops are just as ambiguous as their targets. That ambiguity extends to the ending as well; season 1 leaves several issues unresolved, leaving you begging for the even more impressive developments that await in season 2.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006IUD9Y", "B000FTCLSU", "B000QXDJLI", "B00123BY6S", "B004YOEDR4", "B00316DDYA", "B00005Y6YJ", "B00003CXOP", "B003Y5HWJU", "B001DJLCRC", "B005SEDI5M", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B00J5LXT44", "B0000Y40PW", "B00HUCF420", "B00000FBH2", "B0060MYKYY", "B0012CJQY6", "B00EEDNR9A", "B002AMUDK8", "B001RTSPVY", "0802144993", "B00HW3EXCE", "B0058YPG1G", "B00BVMXBDO", "B00031TYBC", "B00KHWSD1O", "B00FCOTRV2", "B001DW2BFQ", "B0032UYFA6", "B00HGE90Z4", "B000G1R4TS", "B00ECGHM5O", "B0055CP9UY", "B0012CJQYG", "B000NA1VI2", "B0038M2APA", "B0012CJQYQ", "B009LDCZ7I", "B0009GV9E6", "B0060MYM3S", "B0009K7RMA", "B00FEP9MYG", "B0015TX2LO", "B0011VJRVU", "B00ECHBSP8", "B0047H7QD6", "B00B5J6A7W", "B0020TS5EM", "B009VXVMAO", "B004YM6JVO", "B00C8CQRQ4", "B00HUCF7AO", "B001IBIDLI", "B000BO7DWI", "B000KLQUUS", "B004TJ1GY2", "B00FGEO9NE", "B00DJYJRHG", "B0019LY5IM", "B008CLI4N4", "B00I9MS86O", "B00C888LOO", "B00007KLE8", "B0094UOI64", "B004X1VUNI", "B001AQO3WY", "B00DNR3FN6", "B0038M2AQ4", "B002BLNGTS", "B004132HZS", "B00BNH9NCU", "B00BGI076M", "B00BUUAV08", "B00HOGBXS6", "B004HW7JO2", "B00BTRKMNI", "B00BC5FN2C", "B00000I73E", "B000FP2OPY", "B002CPMB9O", "B00CWIMVDW", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B000YABIQ6", "B005DVIOIG", "B00EIXWW2O", "B00HUCF6KK", "B0007YMVWO", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00DW5IKN4", "B00AB55BS0", "B000P0J09M", "B001IBIHQ4", "B00AEFYG3S", "B001GCUER0", "B003EYVXTG", "B00005JNOG", "B000MGBSE4", "B00H7LJ2UO", "B00CDTSFF8"], "bought_together": ["B0006IUD9Y", "B000FTCLSU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005NFJAWG", "B0006IUD9Y", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B001DJLCRC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3788}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 22.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0002ERXC2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511fyhhxpWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Wire: Season 1"}

{"description": "Viewers eagerly awaited director Shinichiro Watanabe's first broadcast series sinceCowboy Bebop, and this quirky, violent period adventure was worth the wait. In contrast to the jazz-inflected disillusionment ofBebop,Champloooffers an edgy mix of martial arts combat and hip-hop irreverence. A string of coincidences brings together three misfits in Meiji-era Japan: Mugen, a rebellious vagabond; Jin, a taciturn ronin; and Fuu, a nutty waitress. Mugen, whose sardonic posture recalls Spike Spiegel, is a formidable swordsman, but he lacks the polish of a great martial artist. His movements, which incorporate break dance spins and flips, reflect his undisciplined nature. Jin is cool to the point of iciness: When he unsheathes his sword, he becomes a deadly work of art in motion. After helping them escape execution, Fuu demands Jin and Mugen stop fighting until they've helped her find an unnamed samurai \"who smells of sun flowers.\" Predictably, chaos ensues.

{"description": "Forty years after the Cylon Wars, humanity's deadliest enemies have reemerged with a vengeance. In a sudden, devastating nuclear attack, the Cylon robots - who have now taken human form - wipe out billions of people. Only a handful of Colonial forces are left to shepherd the few survivors to safety. Commander William Adama (Edward James Olmos), the highest-ranking military officer left alive, reactivates the Battlestar Galactica to once again face humanity's greatest nemeses. Outnumbered and outarmed, Adama reluctantly concedes that the newly sworn-in President Laura Roslin (Mary McDonnell) is correct - this battle was lost before it had begun. With no choice but to flee, the ragtag fleet of survivors and humanity's only hope set out in search of the mythic 13th Colony of Kobol&#x2026; a legendary planet known as Earth.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000V5IP6K", "B002HRF68A", "B000BNI90Y", "B00129W6LE", "B001HUWQEA", "B002ZCY872", "B00A3717C0", "B001RTCP1U", "B0000AFX64", "B00466H3A4", "B0036EH3UC", "B00C7MW5SE", "B0026RHR6U", "B000W4KT9G", "B002HRF7AW", "B001993Y2M", "B002PXJRR2", "B0036EH3U2", "B003RR991Y", "B00A3718IS", "B002JE43O4", "B00344EAFK", "B0051GOB2G", "B000PHX8RA", "B002BAW6FE", "B0000UJL96", "B00402FGE4", "B002BAW6GI", "B0006FO9B0", "B004TJ1H3C", "B00CWX1HPA", "B004EXWGHY", "B00061QJSK", "B0012IXBNC", "B003PGNBO8", "B002BAW6FY", "B0012IX35S", "B00K8HALVI", "B00005B8UD", "B000067FP2", "B00HUPC5X8", "B000CEXFYW", "B0000AQS0F", "B00K8HAKSW", "B00AZMFJYA", "B000E5N6B6", "B0009Q0F5U", "B000FJH5M2", "B003H9LIRK", "B000EOTV98", "B002I9Z8AS", "B00J49R0ZQ", "B000FOPPBA", "B00005JKHP", "B000BOH8Y6", "B000UZ4C4A", "B000JLTRHW", "B00IWTVDUW", "B00F4FFO8E", "B002BAW6GS", "B00023BKMC", "B003H9LIYS", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B000N3T0EG", "B000BCCAEQ", "B002GP7ZV4", "B000YGHC0G", "B000ELL1QC", "B0013GS3WW", "B0002MHDW4", "B000WLU5ZM", "B000HEWEJ4", "B002BAW6H2", "B000QUEQ4U", "B002BVYBJW", "B003W5C0TY", "B001B7CNZ6", "B002U0KHME", "B004HYW84G", "B000E991A2", "B001MT7ZIS", "B00BUWD7WA", "B00B04NIZO", "B0028ERCMU", "B002OKK2AW", "B00003CXZ1", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00DB97LRC", "B0024FAD9C", "B007AFS118", "B000BW7QWW", "B00F3L8P26", "B00AEFYGBA", "B00BGI086Q", "B002U0KHNS", "B00022FWEU", "B007AFC0W4", "B006MFQ4OS"], "bought_together": ["B000V5IP6K", "B002HRF68A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00A3717C0", "B0036EH3UC", "B002HRF68A", "B000BNI90Y"]}, "price": 10.17, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 58080}, "asin": "B00064AFBE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PE4TY9CXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Battlestar Galactica (2003 Miniseries)"}

{"description": "The rugged world of long-haul trucking knits perfectly with classic film noir dynamics in this sizzling, underrated picture. Navy veteran Richard Conte returns home to California, only to plunge into a revenge scenario and a scheme to haul the season's first apples to the teeming San Francisco fruit market (a place seen as a nocturnal jungle for the survival of the fittest). Lee J. Cobb enjoys himself enormously as the chiseling boss at the Frisco market, Millard Mitchell is wry as Conte's angle-playing trucking partner, and Valentina Cortese adds a bright, sexy exoticism to the multi-layered duplicitous dame. Director Jules Dassin, in his last American-shot film before blacklisting, shows his expressive abilities with shadowy interiors and road-movie exteriors alike. The punchy screenplay by A.I. Bezzerides, whose trucking experiences also fueledThey Drive by Night, is a textbook case for the complexities of pulp--not apples, fiction.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006Z2NE0", "B000M2E3GI", "B000MTEFOQ", "B00012L786", "B00005A8TX", "B004C2523M", "B0024FAG80", "B001CC7PM6", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B00007ELDG", "B00005AUK9", "B000B8384Q", "B00023P4GA", "B0024FAG8A", "B000EXDSBQ", "B0000CNY4M", "B009X919UE", "B000PKG6OE", "B0009X7682", "B005152C9G", "B00005AUKD", "B000087F79", "B00I9BU3M2", "B00ICWO1LC", "B000CNE088", "B0080JG2GE", "B00FPUN21O", "B00BGARG3C", "B000LN6UHI", "B000PKG7DE", "B0007ZEO8C", "B0007ZEO7S", "B000B83846", "B00023P4II", "B000FI9OCW", "B008BSM1CI", "B00E18QKJ2", "B000FKO3VW", "B00IGK6T9W", "B0016B6ZEC", "B00KIZYDCI", "B00GPPXNEE", "B00EL6A9CI", "B00005JKGX", "B000EXDSBG", "6305999872", "B00005Y70U", "B00GBT629C", "B001CW7ZSU", "B0010KHOSU", "B00023P4FQ", "B00HRISNPM", "B00004W229", "B00457ZNS8", "B0009X7678", "B001CC7PLW", "B003G9IT3C", "B00074DY0M", "B000CNE08I", "B001CW7ZSA", "B0024FAG6W", "B00DZP1C9K", "B008BSM1XC", "B000AQKUG8", "B00C3ALM02", "B000244F2S", "B009RWRIP2", "B001SMC9L2", "B000093NQZ", "B00004XPPK", "B0007PALVQ", "B00023P4G0", "B00AEBBA7W", "B00007ELD1", "B000FKO3VC", "B00HE011DE", "B00HVOFP12", "B002YNQEFG", "B00GBT62PQ", "B00005RDRL", "B00E21D9ME", "B00CVB6XF2", "B00K6J7IIW", "B00I9BU60Q", "B000KJTGFG", "B002YNQEF6", "B00F98FOFY", "B00BFWKE6C", "B00EL6A7XE", "B00004W19C", "B005152C78", "B00DO0MEOS", "B00553K8DQ", "B00DBE97S8", "B000PMFRW4", "B00C3ALKWM", "B006TTC5A4", "B00K6J7Q6G", "B001QFFBAM", "B0009X766O"], "bought_together": ["B0006Z2NE0", "B000MTEFOQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005A8TX", "B00012L786", "B0006Z2NE0", "B000M2E3GI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 168011}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 26.52, "brand": "Image Entertainment", "asin": "B0006Z2NDQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514GB65DEKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Thieves' Highway (The Criterion Collection)"}
{"description": "Richard Widmark never had better exercise for his Cagney-like bouncing-ball energy thanNight and the City, a classic film noir about a hustler's meteoric flame-out. Although acknowledged as one of the great noir pictures, it's actually set and shot in London, which gives an exotic, displaced novelty to the usual noir universe. Widmark's performance as Harry Fabian is a jibbering, wheedling, giggling tour de force, as Harry schemes his way to setting up a wrestling match and finally establishing himself as a \"somebody.\" Instead, he manages to irritate the underworld heavies (memorably, Herbert Lom and Francis L. Sullivan) whose fingers are already deeply into the criminal pie. Gene Tierney and Googie Withers are the women--one good, one bad--who witness Harry's descent. This was director Jules Dassin's final project for a Hollywood studio before the blacklist forced him out, and he packs the film with tortured camera angles and spidery noir shadows; the movie's a real visual clambake.Night and the Citywas remade, tiredly, with Robert De Niro in 1992. Bonus:  See how strongly this movie has influenced Martin Scorsese.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00012L786", "B000M2E3GI", "B0006Z2NDQ", "B000MTEFOQ", "B00007ELDG", "B00023P4GA", "B00005A8TX", "B000B8384Q", "B000B83846", "B00005RDRL", "B001CC7PM6", "B000087F79", "B00005AUK9", "B004C2523M", "B000PKG6OE", "B0007ZEO8C", "B009X919UE", "B00023P4II", "B000CNE088", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B000EXDSBQ", "B005152C9G", "B0009X7682", "B0024FAG8A", "B0007ZEO7S", "B000EXDSBG", "B00E18QKJ2", "B000LN6UHI", "B00IGK6T9W", "B0024FAG80", "B000244EWO", "B0009X7678", "B00DBE97S8", "B00K6D1S7A", "B00I9BU60Q", "B000PKG7CU", "B00005AUKD", "B0006UEVVS", "B000244F2S", "B00004W229", "B000FKO3VC", "B00FPUN21O", "B00023P4G0", "B000B8380A", "B00004XPPK", "B0010KHOSA", "B000244EX8", "B0080JG2GE", "B000KJTGFG", "B00023P4FQ", "B000PKG798", "B00K6D1R0I", "B0000CNY4M", "B001CC7PLW", "B000CNE08S", "B00E18QK9W", "B000FKO3VM", "B0010KHOSU", "B00CVB6XF2", "B000CNE08I", "B00007ELD1", "B002YNQEFG", "B00GPPXNEE", "6305770328", "B00005Y70U", "B00EL6A7XE", "B000AQKUG8", "B000FKO3VW", "B00004W19C", "B00AF4OTM6", "B004VA0R7Q", "B00BGARG3C", "B00HVOFP12", "B00KIZY3XW", "B0016B6ZEC", "B00K72HVBC", "B0012Z363A", "B0024FAG6W", "B000JLTREK", "B0087ZG7OI", "B00I9BU3M2", "B004S801YK", "B00ICWO1LC", "B000PKG7DE", "B0006UEVVI", "B001CW7ZSU", "B000BGH2NG", "6305999872", "B003ZYU3U0", "B00GBT629C", "B00DBE9684", "B003G9IT3C", "B00C3ALM02", "B00074DY0M", "B000PMFRVU", "B000244EZ6", "B00HRISNPM", "B00553K8DQ", "B00065GX64", "B000FFJYA2"], "bought_together": ["B000M2E3GI", "B0006Z2NDQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00012L786", "B000M2E3GI", "B000B8384Q", "B00023P4GA"]}, "price": 29.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 24900}, "asin": "B0006Z2NE0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VV8FGF7QL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Night and the City (The Criterion Collection)"}

{"description": "The dazed, dreamlike world of director David Gordon Green remains intact, althoughUndertowhas more story than his previous gems (All the Real Girls,George Washington). In the hot, green Georgia countryside, a man (Dermot Mulroney) lives with his two sons on a farm; their existence is shattered by the arrival of the man's Faulknerian brother (Josh Lucas), a dangerous sort with an ulterior motive. The movie that follows is likeThe Night of the Hunterfiltered through aDays of Heavenlens--there's even aHeaven-like narration provided by Jamie Bell. That's what you get for having Terrence Malick produce your movie. The plot doesn't always sit comfortably with Green's uncanny style--sometimes it feels like an intrusion on a private world of childhood--and Josh Lucas is \"actory\" in a way that most Green actors are not. Green is at his best when noticing some stray detail (the younger brother likes to arrange his books according to smell), not when connecting the dots of story. Still, the images will stick in your mind, Tim Orr's cinematography is superb, and Philip Glass provides a suitably mysterioso score.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000YV1Q2G", "B0040ILVME", "B0000AZT1G", "B000VE4UHO", "B001R88C72", "B0000YTOL2", "B000BX8R1A", "B00005JN0D", "B000OVLBGM", "B000A7Q2I2", "B001FB55XA", "B003Y5H4W0", "B00009ZPTY", "B000I2J736", "B001DN0V02", "B000DBHX4M", "B00005V8TD", "B004SEUIW4", "B00177Y9ZC", "B001ER4CQQ", "B0084CAU2O", "B0034G4P6W", "B00CBFB8SU", "B00HE00XE2", "B0002235P8", "B002MD3USC", "B002UJIY2A", "B003CJXIWS", "B0041LULL2", "B006ISJR7U", "B002SF9YUM", "B00AEFYCL4", "B003PAXOL4", "B000V6LSOA", "B0083H6AQA", "B00IKM5OYW", "B002FG9N78", "B000BQ5J2C", "B00D3LA5WG", "B00BEIYKM6", "B004AE3QYE", "B004KA1DGG", "B00FRH0H3Q", "B004OUZLGK", "B00A47BT7C", "B00005Y4RY", "B00GM5GLDW", "B0034G4P30", "B00IJS2OHM", "B004O26LAI", "B00F8PTALC", "B003EYVXTG", "B00J0IN6Z4", "B00003CXIA", "B00EL6AD5Q", "B0034G4P58", "B000M341SC", "B0009X75O2", "B00GS08X2S", "B0088EDOIK", "B003498SCQ", "B00009MEJ4", "B00K0MM4AM", "B000F8O2QU", "B00FXOO1VC", "B009SFR2QI", "B0037QGS0A", "B00H0EN98Y", "B009T3AE1Y", "B000C20VVE", "B00HUCF420", "B00HUTPKA4", "B003Y5H4R0", "B00HHYF5EI", "B00005Y6XA", "B00EL6ADGU", "B001B1UO7G", "B00D3DJIG8", "B0083V2VYG", "B00CBFB8WQ", "B00000F7E6", "B00GBT62PQ", "B00HE00ZIQ", "B005Z9MFCM", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00003CXPD", "B0001DMVBC", "6305308853", "B00G5GNZ78", "B00GHP8SH4", "B002BWP4A6", "B004ZKKKW4", "B00HF98SHG", "B003Z8ZC2A", "B002ASABF4", "B0000A2ZU3", "B000EDWLLY", "B00F6Y3DFE", "B00023P4N8", "B00HVOFP6W"], "bought_together": ["B000BX8R1A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004KA1DGG", "B000BX8R1A", "B0000AZT1G", "B001R88C72"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 157735}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "Lucas", "asin": "B0007R4T3K", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515X5FZC3FL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Undertow"}

{"description": "Among the films that made the '70s an \"American Renaissance\" decade,Hustlemerits a place of honor. As vigorous as the groundbreaking work of such Young Turk contemporaries as Scorsese, Spielberg, and Coppola, its distinction lies in being a throwback to the '50s glory days of its director, Robert Aldrich, when he was making corrosive, Establishment-baiting classics likeAttack!andKiss Me Deadly. The same sardonic spirit, bracing socio-political anger, and bold, hard-edged moviemaking inform this look into the soul of Los Angeles by way of a murder investigation that may not, in fact, have a murder at its core.Steve Shagan wrote the script, and like his 1973Save the Tiger, this movie's central character is a burnt-out case with a nostalgia for lost values: an LAPD detective (Burt Reynolds) whose spiritual/ethical touchstones are film-noir Bogart and soft-focus French movies of the '60s. He should have a girlfriend played by Catherine Deneuve--and he does, a Deneuve whose first signs of aging on screen are an evocative element of the film. Her character is a high-class courtesan whose clients include a prominent attorney (Eddie Albert); he also appears to have had some connection with a 20-year-old hooker/druggie whose corpse just washed up on a California beach. Throw in Ben Johnson as the dead girl's seething war-veteran dad, Eileen Brennan as his wife, Paul Winfield and Ernest Borgnine as Reynolds's fellow cops, and you've got one potent ensemble. Reynolds isn't equal to the task of selling some of Shagan's most florid rhetoric (probably no actor would be), but he makes an honorable stab at it. And as an urbane power-broker who can contemplate an assassination while finishing his Cobb salad, the late Eddie Albert is chilling, just chilling.--Richard T.

{"description": "Dark, unsettling, and intriguing,Paranoia Agentconfirms Satoshi Kon's position as one of the most interesting directors currently working in Japan. A baseball bat-wielding adolescent randomly attacks five people in Tokyo, each of whom is grappling with a serious problem. Toy designer Tsukiko endures tremendous pressure to repeat her previous success; bottom-feeding journalist Kawazu desperately needs money. Popular sixth grader Yuuichi feels threatened by the new kid in his class, the dumpy nerd Usshi. Yuuichi's tutor Harumi is a compassionate scholar by day; at night, she becomes Maria, a sleazy hooker. The seemingly purposeless violence of Lil' Slugger (originallyShounen Bat, literally \"Bat Boy\"), also disrupts the lives of police detectives Maniwa and Karino, and their corrupt boss Hirukawa. As he did inPerfect Blue, Kon deliberately blurs the boundaries between reality and fantasy: Does Tsukikio's stuffed toy really talk to her? Which is Harumi's true personality? A noteworthy series from an important artist. This set includes all four volumes of the series.

{"description": "When a baby girl appears on the doorstep of a Parisian apartment belonging to a trio of hedonistic bachelors, baby care is thrust upon them with hilarious and, ultimately, heartwarming results in this 1985 French comedy (with English subtitles) by writer/director Coline Serreau. Pierre, Michel, and Jacques are pleasure-seeking professionals with the singular goal to seduce women in their spare time. When Jacques leaves on a three-week vacation, a mix-up ensues and roommates Pierre and Michel (Roland Giraud and Michel Boujenah, respectively) discover that the \"package\" Jacques has enlisted them to watch in his absence is a cooing infant in a pink bassinette. With no prior experience and unable to contact Jacques (Andr&#xE9; Dussollier) to whom the baby was \"addressed,\" they dive into the frenzied fracas of diapers and feeding schedules. Adding insult to insanity, they must fend off drug dealers&#x97;and police--interested in another \"package.\" The simple storyline leaves plenty of room for shenanigans&#x97;formulaic perhaps, but still irresistible. Rather than a morality play on the recklessness of child abandonment, farcical comedy prevails. Over time, the men are smitten with little Marie who gives them plenty of adorable moments until they can't live without her. The obvious appeal of the story inspired the American remake two years later, though the French version is more compelling, nuanced, and touching. Parents should take note of the PG-13 rating for excessive profanity and sexual content.

So it's remarkable thatCrasheven got made; that it's a rich, intelligent, and moving exploration of the interlocking lives of a dozen Los Angeles residents--black, white, latino, Asian, and Persian--is downright amazing. A politically nervous district attorney (Brendan Fraser) and his high-strung wife (Sandra Bullock, biting into a welcome change of pace fromMiss Congeniality) get car-jacked by an oddly sociological pair of young black men (Larenz Tate and Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges); a rich black T.V. director (Terrence Howard) and his wife (Thandie Newton) get pulled over by a white racist cop (Matt Dillon) and his reluctant partner (Ryan Phillipe); a detective (Don Cheadle) and his Latina partner and lover (Jennifer Esposito) investigate a white cop who shot a black cop--these are only three of the interlocking stories that reach up and down class lines. Writer/director Paul Haggis (who wrote the screenplay forMillion Dollar Baby) spins every character in unpredictable directions, refusing to let anyone sink into a stereotype. The cast--ranging from the famous names above to lesser-known but just as capable actors like Michael Pena (Buffalo Soldiers) and Loretta Devine (Woman Thou Art Loosed)--meets the strong script head-on, delivering galvanizing performances in short vignettes, brief glimpses that build with gut-wrenching force.

{"description": "One of the definitive TV shows of the 1970s originally aspired to the dark moral  complexity of anthology shows likeThe Twilight Zone. Even diehard fans will have to admitFantasy Islandfell short of its goal--but that didn't stop it from becoming hugely popular, lasting for seven powerhouse seasons. All the most iconic elements were present from the beginning: Diminutive Tattoo (Herve Villechaize,The Man with the Golden Gun) shouting \"De plane! De plane!\"; infinitely gracious Mr.  Roarke (Ricardo Montalban,Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan) commanding \"Smiles, everyone, smiles,\" before delivering pages of exposition with his implacable Latin gravitas; the white suits; the tropical island that somehow has all the vegetation and weather patterns in the world; the pageant of celebrities from Jim Backus to Karen Valentine, Barbi Benton to Don Knotts--it all added up to sneakily addictive television. After all, wish-fulfillment--be it a schlub who wants to be irresistible to chicks or kids who want their separated parents to reconcile or a former cheerleading team who want to relive their high school glory days--had a built-in narrative hook, even though the resolution (various versions of \"be careful what you wish for\") was never in doubt. Almost every episode bubbled over with sex, revenge, ambition, and regret, delivered with a shameless lack of subtlety. Over the course of the first season, the interplay between Montalban and Villechaize--each armed with an intriguing exotic accent--became more and more prominent, with Mr.  Roarke becoming increasingly supernatural while Tattoo oozed the mortal sins of greed and lechery. Turn on any episode; you'll find it hard to stop watching, no matter how cheesy or ludicrous the storyline. This four-dvd set includes the original TV movie pilot, its sequel, and the 16 episode first season, as well as a couple of largely bland featurettes enlivened by the occasional barbed comment from executive producer Leonard Goldberg.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000Z6GT18", "B0028SVY3Y", "B0018O5WTQ", "B001HUHBC2", "B0028SVY3E", "B00030M7SK", "B00008WJEZ", "B000ASDFIG", "B000UX6TJ8", "B005LFQRTC", "B00005JO4F", "B00008EYBH", "B0007CNY54", "B0011NVC9S", "B003W5C0TY", "B008H6GHII", "B000GRU09I", "B000EQ45BU", "B0001BS3IE", "B005EVY8NA", "B00EWJO416", "B00005JO3P", "B004M9ZI0C", "B000OVLBH6", "B00JDCP0QA", "B000FDFSH2", "B0050MB5AC", "B000O77SNG", "B0028RABR0", "B00018D3RI", "B000GW8UAE", "B00HZMZ286", "B000291Q3O", "B00A4Y62JU", "B008OR5X6M", "B000NQRV8U", "B0089BSLKS", "B00005JOJR", "B00DXLO086", "B000CELOW2", "B0002MHDW4", "B00008R9MC", "B002XKKX8E", "B0055CP9MC", "B00AA8Q0JM", "B000LXGXY8", "B00DYQ1GBE", "B001SGN1JM", "B000CS45AG", "B00DXLO0D6", "B000291Q3Y", "B00274SIVA", "B006VC3L48", "B000BGR1B4", "B001E6FMMU", "B001MBTSTU", "B000068V9X", "B0001ZMWYG", "B001NPK5BU", "B001E6JC30", "B001666484", "B002JIOOBW", "B00005JOA4", "B001BN4WLS", "B000R7I3YG", "B000A9QKSM", "B00005JNIS", "B000E3L7EQ", "B004GJYR82", "B0015I2S7E", "B009TTGLJ2", "B000YKYT1M", "B00EC9UI0C", "B000X07SQ6", "B000MGBSEY", "B00BHWG0N6", "B0007IO6V4", "B00CNTGAVY", "B00AIA884W", "B0009OUBPQ", "B00KI27R4M", "B002WQ79A4", "B00005JMHI", "B00DXLO0BI", "B00EIBO8PU", "B00005JNHU", "B000C6NPHC", "B0006Z2L4W", "B0006Q93N8", "B000JJSJP0", "B0001O3YHQ", "B001675ZJW", "B000HIVIOC", "B000VWQU88", "B007KW5M6I", "B003L77FWA", "B000SMNK16", "B00GLPYVT4"], "bought_together": ["B000Z6GT18"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0028SVY3Y", "B0018O5WTQ", "B000Z6GT18", "B001HUHBC2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10318}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.99, "brand": "Columbia Tri Star", "asin": "B000B8IA3U", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5169EVQVX7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fantasy Island - The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "Anna (Arly Jover,Blade) is losing her memory. It started the day she failed to recognize her husband, Laurent (Philippe Bas). \"I'm going crazy,\" she whispers to herself. Then at a dinner party, faces suddenly morph into death masks. Elsewhere in Paris, Captain Nerteaux (Jocelyn Quivrin,Syriana) is trying to catch a serial killer. The three female victims, all Turkish illegals, were tortured and mutilated. Out of desperation, Nerteaux turns to \"Shifty\" Schiffer (a blond Jean Reno) for help. A brutal cop with ties to the Turkish underworld, Schiffer is easily persuaded. (Too easily, perhaps.) Meanwhile, Anna begins seeing Dr. Mathilde (Laura Morante,The Son's Room). Despite the freaky Francis Bacon painting in her waiting room, which Anna finds terrifying, Mathilde turns out to be a sympathetic psychiatrist who helps unravel the truth about her condition--her face was altered and her memory erased. At the same time, Schiffer helps Nerteaux to solve his mystery. The link between the two is a right-wing organization called the Grey Wolves, which will lead all of them to Turkey for the explosive climax.Empire of the Wolvesexerts the same grim fascination asThe Crimson Rivers, a previous Jean-Christophe Grang&#xE9; adaptation featuring Reno.

{"description": "Here's how director Sam Peckinpah described his motivation behindThe Wild Bunchat the time of the film's 1969 release: \"I was trying to tell a simple story about bad men in changing times.The Wild Bunchis simply what happens when killers go to Mexico. The strange thing is you feel a great sense of loss when these killers reach the end of the line.\" All of these statements are true, but they don't begin to cover the impact that Peckinpah's film had on the evolution of American movies. Now the film is most widely recognized as a milestone event in the escalation of screen violence, but that's a label of limited perspective. Of course, Peckinpah's bloody climactic gunfight became a masterfully directed, photographed, and edited ballet of graphic violence that transcended the conventional Western and moved into a slow-motion realm of pure cinematic intensity. But the film--surely one of the greatest Westerns ever made--is also a richly thematic tale of, as Peckinpah said, \"bad men in changing times.\"The Wild Bunchis a masterpiece that should not be defined strictly in terms of its violence, but as a story of mythic proportion, brimming with rich characters and dialogue and the bittersweet irony of outlaw traditions on the wane.--Jeff ShannonPat Garrett & Billy the Kidmay be the most beautiful and ambitious film that Sam Peckinpah ever made. The time is 1881. Powerful interests want New Mexico tamed for their brand of progress, and Sheriff Pat Garrett (James Coburn) is commissioned to rid the territory of his old gunfighting comrades. He serves fair notice to William Bonney--Billy the Kid (Kris Kristofferson)--and his Fort Sumter cronies, but it's not in their nature, or his, to go quietly. Peckinpah's theme, more than ever, is the closing of the frontier and the nature of the loss that that entails. But this time his vision takes him beyond genre convention, beyond history and legend, to the bleeding heart of myth--and surely of himself. This is one strange and original movie. In 1973 most American reviewers responded by panning it and deriding its director, whom they saw as having betrayed the promise ofRide the High Country, been swept up in his own cult of violence, and become incoherent as a storyteller. Coherence wasn't helped by MGM's cutting at least a quarter-of-an-hour out of the finished film and removing a bitter, retrospective prelude. Subsequent releases have restored a lot of material, and now there's more widespread appreciation of the depth and power of Peckinpah's achievement. The cast, teeming with fine character actors, is extraordinary, making the gallery of frontier denizens vivid and resonant.--Richard T. JamesonWhat does it tell us that Sam Peckinpah's most joyous and life-affirming movie is also his most underappreciated?The Ballad of Cable Hoguewas made in that singular moment when, having just completedThe Wild Bunch, Peckinpah knew he was back in the game as a feature-film director; and before anyone (including Peckinpah himself?) had an inkling of how completely he was about to redefine the Western genre, contemporary American filmmaking, and his own personal legend.Cable Hogueis a splendiferous entertainment: a grufty Western tall tale, a lusty comedy, and also (in critic Kathleen Murphy's phrase) \"a musical about the economic and emotional complexities of capitalism.\" Its title character--Jason Robards in a great, exuberant gift of a performance--is an ornery varmint left by two scurrilous partners (L.Q. Jones and Strother Martin) to die in the desert. Besides such Peckinpah regulars as Slim Pickens, R.G. Armstrong, and Gene Evans, the movie features Stella Stevens in her career-best role as Hildy, Hogue's best reason for getting into town now and again, and David Warner, an itinerant preacher and full-time lech who becomes his soulmate. Lucien Ballard photographed, and there's a charming song score (by Richard Gillis) whose neglect is as mystifying as that of the film. Above all, there is Sam Peckinpah exulting in the lyrical, heart-filling possibilities of making a motion picture, trying just about anything, and finding it beautiful. This film was his personal favorite.--Richard T. JamesonRide the High Countryis the one Sam Peckinpah movie about which there has never been controversy--save at MGM in 1962, when a new studio regime opted to dump this beautiful, heartbreakingly elegiac Western into the bottom half of a double-bill. Westerns rarely even got reviewed back then, so it's wellnigh miraculous that critics discovered the movie and raved about it.Newsweekcalled it the best American picture of the year. Veteran cowboy stars Randolph Scott and Joel McCrea portray aging gunslingers in the twilight of the Old West. The slow-building tension between longtime friends--one still true to the code he's lived by, the other having drifted away from it--anticipates the tortuous personal dilemmas played out to the death by Peckinpah's Wild Bunch, Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, and Benny and Elita inBring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia. The action scenes are powerful, if only beginning to suggest the radical technique with which Peckinpah would astonish audiences in just a few years. But his feeling for flavorsome dialogue, Rabelaisian humor, and full-blooded character acting is already unmistakable. McCrea and Scott are simply superb.

{"description": "This visually stunning film is the product of a collaboration of award-winning graphic novelist Neil Gaiman (creator of the much-laudedSandmanseries), his frequent collaborator Dave McKean (Cages), and The Jim Henson Company, themselves no strangers to elaborate fantasies such asThe Dark Crystal. andLabyrinth. As with the latter film,MirrorMaskfocuses on a young woman unhappy with her daily existence; here, the artistically inclined Helena (Stephanie Leonides), is at odds with her circus performer parents. When a careless insult appears to send her mother (Gina McKee) into a coma, Helena withdraws into the dark and elaborate world of her drawings, in which a scenario very similar to her predicament in the real world is unfolding. Gaiman and director McKean create arresting images to populate Helena's world, and the Henson Company brings them vividly to life with CGI; though the story is occasionally murky, the fantasy elements are imaginative enough to enthrall what will undoubtedly be the film's toughest customers--younger viewers.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005G1729K", "B002LFPBLU", "B001HN69AY", "B00000JPH6", "B00000K3D4", "B002VRNIZO", "B000934FC2", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B000EU1Q5E", "B003UAKE9Y", "B004QSQMKE", "B002UOMH00", "B000BPL2GK", "B004ALIG0G", "0060821094", "B003RHZ6IE", "B002436WFI", "B0018O4YT0", "B0011E5M66", "B0011NVC98", "B00005JPAR", "B000A283AW", "0060596384", "B002TZS5G0", "B000KJU128", "B00AEFXCLU", "0783225903", "B0031DDG9A", "B0012E2GFK", "B000C3L27U", "B008R52L8E", "B002NZK5SW", "B002FUI4CE", "B0068FZ0O2", "B00DAABKQK", "B000NJMJGG", "1616552107", "B004EPYZU8", "B00005AB62", "B002GOAH10", "B0041T52S6", "B00447L4JG", "B000YAA2SQ", "1401237541", "B00HUCF7AO", "0783225490", "0060798750", "B00003CXBK", "1593077521", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B008QE9XD2", "B003DBLDIQ", "B008JFUPPI", "B0030BS1CU", "B00077BPA0", "B0002V7O3I", "B0001Z37HM", "B002J1RZHE", "B000Q66FB6", "B002NZK5V4", "B004B93RDS", "B00006JDVV", "B0016BWACI", "B000AQOHMG", "B000E1YW2M", "B001HN694K", "B001AGXEAG", "B0010X741Y", "B006VJ1AAI", "B00C888MJ8", "B00005JLEU", "B002LFPBOM", "B0048LPRCS", "006228214X", "0061450162"], "bought_together": ["B005G1729K", "B002LFPBLU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00000JPH6", "B00000K3D4", "B00004Y7ET", "B002NZK5SW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30032}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.99, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000BT97AO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512BS13XW3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "MirrorMask"}

Two scientists race against time to fix the catastrophic error while their world collapses around them and every minute brings the human race closer to extinction.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001BSBBJE", "B002Y2BDEE", "B00005JKLZ", "0060785691", "B0007CEXUY", "6305090564", "B000087F6L", "B00IKM5LXG", "B00AEFYXQI", "B00D9EJFZA", "B004RBC5S8", "B001A7GOCA", "B000E5N6B6", "B00AEBB8QK", "B002DLB17K", "B0031U8OE0", "B005H3AZ50", "B000EHQ7Y2", "B0041SI78O", "B00368PSN2", "B0002CR03Q", "B005FQ2H8W", "B00AGKHF1G", "B002GHHHL0", "B000RW5BZ0", "B00D9EJFV4", "B00358MG8S", "B00BNAE14W", "B001EAWMGA", "B002TZS5GU", "B0001Z52RU", "B00IYRLUAU", "B004XQO90O", "B00FQPLZ08", "B0073U2FB2", "B0077PTWCI", "B000U1ZV7Q", "6305761078", "B00IWTVDUW", "B000JBXHQY", "B00GSTHC7G", "B007N3202S", "B00153ZR8G", "B0045HCJSA", "B001BGS17Q", "B00AIBZMM2", "B00AEFYCW8", "B00003CWRF", "B001GM6C44", "B00AEBB94G", "B00BTYNXJG", "B00006JDVV", "6305869367", "B003CLANAG", "B0007R4T26", "B00H83EUQW", "B0007N1JC8", "B000OCZ9WS", "B001KO1BCG", "B002VA59ZS", "B008JFUQZ2", "B000QGEB1W", "B0041SI78Y", "B001NFNFFS", "B0077PTWLO", "B008JFUO4U", "0783225520", "B0045HCJ0S", "B000IHY9TS", "B000063UR0", "B00003CWU3", "B007X4ECMI", "B00008G8M4", "B008JFUNHI", "B00JL6L4WC", "B00BJB2FCU", "B000BUNZY2", "B007WYPRAU", "B000FVQLKW", "B00AMEZDPG", "B00AEFXPSK", "B00004YA66", "B000096IAC", "B00005JLWN", "B008CAVVDU", "B00005JL78", "B002QW7ALM", "B0006Z2LJC", "B008JFUO36", "B00BOXZAJ8", "B00CTSDDVO", "B00005JPD0", "B000031EG1", "B00151QYOO", "B00DSAUJ32", "B005LAIHXQ", "B00BLF9FOK", "B008JFUN50", "B000JYW5DW", "B003Y5H5FG"], "bought_together": ["B001BSBBJE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JKLZ", "0060785691", "B0007CEXUY", "B0041SI78O"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 60439}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.49, "brand": "Gaiam", "asin": "B000CZ0PNK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519559Z964L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Sound of Thunder (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "It is truly wondrous that Criterion selected the obscure sci-fi cult gem,Equinox, to bestow with classic status. Filmed in Bronson Canyon, Los Angeles, three teens used their college funds to make the $6500 film about four kids who stumble upon a Satanic bible with tragic consequences. David (Edward Connell), Susan (Barbara Hewitt), Jim (Frank Bonner), and Vicki (Robin Christopher) see a medieval castle, find an old man living in a cave, enter an alternate universe, and fight several monsters, including the devil, all in the course of an afternoon. In the same demonic spirit asRosemary's Baby, released two years prior,Equinox'soccult thrill factor is amplified by Harryhausen-like special effects courtesy of Dennis Muren (Star Wars,Jurassic Park). Reminiscent ofKing Kongand the sci-fi greats of the 50s, Equinox would be ideally viewed in a drive-in. This Criterion box set contains both the original version, titledThe Equinox, and the superior 1970 remake by Jack Woods, who stars as Asmodeus, a possessed Park Ranger. An introductory film stars Forrest J. Ackerman, discussing his influential magazineFamous Monsters of Filmland. A second disc includes test footage, silent takes, an interview with Dennis Muren, and the short filmZorgon: The H-Bomb Beast fron Hell. The booklet contains a critical essay aboutEquinoxas well as introductions by George Lucas and Ray Harryhausen.

{"description": "Beginning its six-year run in 1982,St. Elsewherewas neither television's first ensemble medical drama nor, heaven knows, its last. Yet this four-disc set of all 22 episodes from the first season is a reminder that this was, and still is, one of the very best. Even now, when \"reality\" programming blights the landscape like some biblical plague, doc, cop, and lawyer shows remain staples of the medium, and while the likes ofC.S.I.,E.R., andGrey's Anatomyhave it all overSt. Elsewherein the sizzle department--the production values are much flashier, the content sexier, more graphic, and faster-moving, the technology both in front of and behind the camera light years more sophisticated--the older show, despite its somewhat cheesy '70s vibe, is the hands-down winner when it comes to the actual steak. That's because it does it the old-fashioned way: by relying on good writing, vividly-drawn, identifiable characters, and excellent performances by an eye-opening group of actors.Co-creators Joshua Brand and John Falsey's pilot episode, which establishes the scene at Boston's St. Eligius Hospital (mocked as \"St. Elsewhere\" due to its rundown facilities and reputation as a \"dumping ground\" for the poor and disenfranchised), isn't especially promising. While we can see right away that the show sports a lighter, more humorous tone than others of its genre, the direction is static, the acting and dialogue are often stiff, and what passes for \"chaos\" is pretty tame. But it hits its stride almost immediately thereafter, as the characters (including Howie Mandel's wisecracking Dr. Fiscus, David Morse's driven, committed Dr. Morrison, William Daniels' egotistical, pompous Dr. Craig, and Ed Begley, Jr.'s nerdy Dr. Ehrlich) are more fully realized. The cast, in fact, may be the most impressive ever assembled for a TV program: in the first season alone, the list of actors with regular, recurring, and one-shot appearances includes future movie stars Denzel Washington (a regular, but his role is minor), Tim Robbins, Ally Sheedy, Christopher Guest, Laraine Newman, Ray Liotta, Tom Hulce, Michael Madsen, and Rae Dawn Chong. Sure, some of the multiple storylines are dated: the handling of issues like gun control, immigration, and terrorism seems almost quaint by today's standards, and a running gag concerning ladies man Dr. Samuels' (David Birney) having to inform his many lovers that he has gonorrhea comes off as tasteless and unfunny, notwithstanding that era's low awareness of AIDS and other STDs. But on the whole, thisSt. Elsewhereset (extras include audio commentary for \"Cora and Arnie,\" plus four featurettes) is a reminder of episodic TV at its best.--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BOH8YG", "B000EHSVC8", "B000K7VHJ6", "B00005JLFT", "B00188XHF8", "B00GHH9HUE", "B00D2UMHVA", "B00GSTHCHQ", "B00HRUQA6O", "B001U9BS2O", "B004STBF2G", "B00188XHFI", "B00GLT2TR6", "B005DLN1LG", "B00144K5LK", "B004STBF5S", "B00KWP6JMG", "B00KYCA4QY", "B00005JO3P", "B00I4581F4", "B00KTFJ7UA", "B0001XAQ96", "B006WK4Y6I", "B0000EMYGP", "B000EXDS0C", "B000BX0VU0", "B000SMNK16", "B002NN7EXS", "B000BZISRG", "B00005JNJ1", "B00KTFJ6J2", "B004STBFPS", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B001AQT158", "B00GHH9HW2", "B00FM4S8H6", "B000TGURZ8", "B00IRIMGTA", "B00I3RHUX2", "B00JHH1VUU", "B0015XHR5C", "B00JBBRKSE", "B001FSKE8E", "B00008PHCZ", "B004STBFI0", "B00ITAQ2T6", "630276646X", "B00FWMVVK4", "B001JAHQ1G", "B006WK4Y8Q", "B001JAHQ1Q", "B00HZMZ286", "B000HT3P56", "B004STBEXQ", "B000NDEXO8", "B00005JLF3", "B000EHSVBE", "B005FQ2HBO", "B000JJSLA8", "B00HW3EXCE", "B003L77FY8", "B00HRUQB5O", "B000YKYT1M", "B00008NV4G", "B000WMA74A", "B000HWZ4HU", "B00GOC74QG", "B000MTEFUK", "B00EIXWMII", "0783230532", "B005KK2FTO", "B000CS45AG", "B0007XBMA2", "B00005JO9J", "B00008WJEY", "B000IMV3XS", "B004MLEYV4", "B000EGDAF2", "B00ECHBSP8", "B000F8O2MO", "B000GW8UAE", "B001L1S1OO", "B000BGR1B4", "B0009UC80Q", "B00369ERC4", "B00018D3RI", "B0006N2EZA", "B00005JNEQ", "B00005JO4F", "B0001HAGQK", "B0035CVB2Q", "B0000633QV", "B00HNGC56G", "B00005JOXR", "B000B8IA3U", "B002XKKX8E", "B00FWMVVI6", "B0002NY8R6", "B00J5LXT44"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLFT"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00GSTHCHQ", "B000BOH8YG", "B00005JLFT", "B00D2UMHVA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 24316}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 18.2, "brand": "20TH Century Fox", "asin": "B000GPPNO2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PSPQFYRQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "St. Elsewhere - Season 1"}
{"description": "The love life of a woolly mammoth--handled with G-rated delicacy--drives this sequel to the first computer-animated romp in the age of prehistoric mammals. While the firstIce Agetook a delightful premise and suffocated it with a formulaic plot--in which a mammoth named Manfred (voiced by Ray Romano,Everyone Loves Raymond), a sloth named Sid (John Leguizamo,Moulin Rouge!), and a sabre-tooth tiger named Diego (Denis Leary,Rescue Me) helped an abandoned human infant return to its tribe (basically,Three Mammals and a Baby)--the sequel takes the now-familiar setting, gives it a shapeless, episodic storyline, and yet somehow becomes pretty darn entertaining. Faced with the threat of a flood from melting ice, our heroic trio are on the run to escape from their blossoming valley. On the way, they meet a female mammoth (Queen Latifah,Bringing Down the House) who thinks she's an opossum and get menaced by some freshly defrosted carnivo!  rous fish. Add into the mix a herd of lava-worshipping mini-sloths, some Busby Berkeley-style vultures, and more ingenious slapstick featuring the acorn-crazed Scrat, andIce Age: The Meltdownwill amuse even jaded adults. --Bret FetzerBeyondIce Age: The MeltdownIce Age - Super Cool EditionIce Age & Ice Age 2: The Meltdown - (DVD 2-Pack)Funtastic Adventures Collection Box Set (Ice Age / Robots / Fern Gully / Once Upon a Rainforest)Stills fromIce Age: The Meltdown(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001GCUNWQ", "B005LAIISA", "B0006UEVT0", "B005QODEEE", "B000AY74OG", "B001NCDFTW", "B004HO6I4M", "B000UVKGPI", "B000MV9026", "B00005JMQZ", "B005LAIHW2", "B00CWM58WY", "B0039N74CW", "B0006JMLRK", "B00005JNQS", "B00CHVJODE", "B002WJI2QQ", "B002ZG9904", "B000L22SG6", "B00365F6I2", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B0042U94UQ", "B008JFUQ16", "B000M343BC", "B001ECQ75A", "B001DPHDCY", "B00JK531ES", "B0013FSWT2", "B001GCUO7A", "B001FTIJS0", "B001GCUNW6", "B0012EM5D8", "B00G5G7EXY", "B009PPO78W", "B00005JNS0", "B00E00OGE2", "B00E9ZATJO", "B0030IIZ4M", "B00007LVCM", "B0030IIYYS", "B000VBJEEG", "B000FQISFS", "B00ALMNCLQ", "B004EPZ034", "0783231474", "B00003CXJ4", "B002ZG97YM", "B00AFEX83C", "B00F522C7C", "B000H7JCK0", "B0046A9RMM", "B00HLTD2OE", "B0013FSL3E", "B00947N6D8", "B001U3D88M", "B001PR0YEE", "B00275EHJG", "B001HN6918", "B00GRZPQCO", "B004EPZ0AC", "B008YWY0HK", "B0090SI1RM", "B004G600A4", "B001HN6922", "B0000AOX0O", "B00LG6YEKE", "B003TJM6I8", "B0000VV4W2", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B00005JN4W", "B00EV1YZ96", "B004LWZW7Y", "B00029LO0Y", "B004HO6HXY", "B001OMU6UM", "B002XODB66", "B000SJQQPQ", "B005LAIH4A", "B00AEFXMSS", "B000BITUVG", "B000RMJ4F8", "B005F96UJ6", "B005SDUV4E", "B003Y5H5AG", "B004EPZ048", "B001APZMJS", "B009PQCR74", "B003H9M1Q2", "B0000CABKY", "B000AAF1TU", "B00004R99F", "B00CTQWJEI", "B00EPH8SFI", "B0000AK7AA", "B003UESJF6", "B00EBBGLFC", "B0034G4OYA", "B005KG4EFG", "B00H7KJTMG"], "bought_together": ["B001GCUNWQ", "B005LAIISA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005LAIISA", "B001GCUNWQ", "B0006UEVT0", "B00CWM58WY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30729}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.4, "brand": "Fox Home Entertainment", "asin": "B000GUJYZQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518KJJQ5ZNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ice Age - The Meltdown (Full Screen Edition)"}

{"description": "British comedy is often known for its menagerie of absurdities. Little Britain - The Complete Third Series upholds this tradition with the comedy genius of Matt Lucas and David Walliams, as they take it to up another notch in the third seasom. Little Britain has cultivated a devotion to the characters, listen carefully and you may hear the person next to you quoting \"Yeah, but no, but yeah but&#x85;\". Lucas and Walliams reveal them to us bit by bit, so we remain perplexed enough to imagine where they came from and what will eventually happen to them. We are dropped into the middle of their lives, and are lucky enough to observe them sorting things out. The episodes on this two-disc set are filled with returning favorites we get to know even better (whether we want to or not), as well as introducing new \"Britons\". We witness the insensitive and abusive Marjorie Daws, leader of Fatfighters weight loss support group, encouraging the group members to snack on \"dust\" because it has no calories. A returning favorite is Daffyd, the rotund, spandex-wearing, self proclaimed \"only gay in the village\", though life, his family, and the \"homophobic\" village repeatedly show him otherwise. New characters not to be missed include a lovely woman unable to control her bodily functions, a questionable mail order bride, and a rival for the spa resident Bubbles. Of course the sassiest narrator on television returns, spouting articulately, \"Who They? What do? And why?\" His banter is just another reason why visiting with the people of Little Britain is hilariously unforgettable.--Rachel Moss", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000F7CMSG", "B0009FVS8Y", "B000UPMZ4E", "B000N8UY1E", "B001G0NK28", "B006K10WII", "B00JJRLG7G", "B0012EM5BK", "B001PMRBMC", "B002945DX4", "B00004Z4V5", "B0009WFFBS", "B0083V2VYG", "B001NOMOS8", "B0009WFFD6", "B002EOVX9W", "B0000797E5", "B0000AQS8B", "B00065GX8C", "B0074JOD8U", "B0000A02TY", "B000U1ZV9E", "B000RXZILG", "B000BVM1SM", "B001E181XC", "B000VA3JDO", "B008B4LRMC", "0091914426"], "bought_together": ["B000F7CMSG", "B000UPMZ4E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000F7CMSG", "B0009FVS8Y", "B000UPMZ4E", "B000N8UY1E"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 58776}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 13.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000HLDFAE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VE6FY2NEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Little Britain - The Complete Third Series"}
{"description": "Here are three films that couldn't and wouldn't have been made at any other time.  Contrary to popular belief, the history of Hollywood permissiveness, what filmmakers could \"get away with\" on screen, is not a steadily rising graph from puritanical early days to the party-hearty present.  In the early 1930s, a national mood of shock over the stock market crash and impatience with Prohibition licensed a relaxation of the movie industry's self-censorship policies.  Sexuality--always a driving force in movie plots and characterizations, even when repressed--became a more explicit presence, with costuming that sometimes pushed the envelope for exposure of epidermis and dialogue that could be shockingly blunt.Baby Face(1933) was made at Warner Bros., the golden-age studio with the grittiest style and the most street cred.  The gutsy Barbara Stanwyck stars as a young woman from a factory town who hops a boxcar to the big city and sleeps her way to the top--a progress famously indexed by a camera ascending floor by floor outside a Gotham office building as she trades up, one corporate suitor after another.  No other major-studio film was more explicit about sex as a tool and a commodity, yetBaby Faceis curiously lesssexythan any number of movies that weren't so outspoken about it.  This TCM collection features both the theatrical-release version familiar for decades and a recently rediscovered preview version that is markedly superior, runs five minutes longer, and includes more sexual liaisons.  It also happily lacks an absurd final scene that got tacked onto the release version to explain how the heroine learned to be content with a modest lifestyle.Red-Headed Woman(1932) is arguably the raunchiest movie Jean Harlow made at MGM (though not as raunchy as her scenes in Howard Hughes' 1930Hell's Angels).  Unlike Stanwyck inBaby Face--a proletarian heroine grimly selling herself to beat capitalism and the patriarchy at their own game--Harlow's character brazenly relishes both the sex and the posh life it wins for her.  The lion's share of this sardonic comedy, scripted by Anita Loos and an uncredited F. Scott Fitzgerald, focuses on Harlow's seduction of her married boss (Chester Morris) and the havoc she wreaks in his upper-crust world. Charles Boyer has a role (his first Hollywood credit) as a French chauffeur who knows how to give satisfaction, and the film's air of breezy ribaldry even allows the star a casual flash of bare breast.The rarest item in the collection, the 1931 Universal version ofWaterloo Bridge, has long been unseen because MGM bought the film in order to do a 1940 remake (starring Vivien Leigh) and locked the original away in the vault.  Directed by James Whale the same year he didFrankenstein(1931), the picture charts the romance of a chorus-girl-turned-streetwalker (Mae Clarke) and a well-born young soldier (Kent Douglass) on brief furlough from the trenches during WWI.  Apart from a zesty prelude in a London music hall and two scenes on the titular bridge, the film remains yoked to its talky theatrical source, a Robert E. Sherwood play flogging the hoary conceit that no fallen woman, however pure of heart, could be permitted to marry into a good family.  Unlike the Hays Code-compliant remake, the film leaves no doubt how the heroine makes her living.--Richard T.

{"description": "The second volume of season 1 ofPerry Masonfleshes out the splendid entire first year of the show, a masterpiece of '50s film noir and crisp, savvy TV writing. Raymond Burr's unflappable defense attorney Perry Mason is equal parts P.I., father confessor, and yes, judge, jury, and executioner. The crimes include murder most foul, and lots of that sordid specter that haunted people pre-internet: blackmail. Everyone has a motive, and everyone in the harsh light of Los Angeles seems to have something to hide. The boxed set contains the remaining 21 episodes of the first season, with highlights like \"The Case of the Lonely Heiress,\" in which detective and Mason sidekick Paul Drake tracks down a rich woman, who is then suddenly accused of the murder of the man who tried to find her.

{"description": "Sweet baby Jesus, we thank you for blessing Will Ferrell and Adam McKay with the talent to create a NASCAR comedy as hilarious asTalladega Nights. The so-called \"Ballad of Ricky Bobby\" is hardly flawless  in fact it's not always firing on all cylinders  but with comedy star Ferrell and director McKay still hot from the success of their previous comedy hitAnchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, most of this 108-minute spoof of oval-track racing is so knee-slappin' funny that you can't help but surrender to the stupidity.Obviously, Ferrell's the shining star, and his portrayal of lead-footed pit-crew-member-turned-#1 NASCAR champion Ricky \"I Wanna Go Fast\" Bobby (how can you not love that name?) is spot-on perfect, righteously spoofing the entirety of NASCAR culture without insulting its oft-ridiculed roots in redneck bootlegging of a bygone era. You could even argue that Talladega Nights is truer to NASCAR than Tom Cruise'sDays of Thunder, and it's certainly more entertaining, especially when you add John C. Reilly as Ricky's life-long pal, teammate, and eventual rival Cal Naughton, Jr. (together they're nicknamed \"Shake 'n Bake\"), and Sacha Baron Cohen (fromDa Ali G ShowandBorat) as gay French \"Formula Un\" driver-turned NASCAR rival Jean Girrard, to a stellar cast including Molly Shannon, Greg Germann, Amy Adams and Michael Clarke Duncan.Sure, it's mostly a showcase for Ferrell's loud, over-the-top antics and nonsensical non sequiturs (like cameo appearances by Elvis Costello and Mos Def), but with Ferrell behind the wheel,Talladega Nightsrolls into victory lane with fuel to spare, and there's one final bit of comedy (with a tip of the hat to William Faulkner) for those who sit through the credits. --Jeff ShannonStills fromTalladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby(click for larger image)More NASCAR andTalladega Nightsat Amazon.comThe CalendarOn blu-rayNASCAR on PSPOur NASCAR StoreNASCAR The Imax ExperienceSpeed, Guts, and GloryBookOther Will Ferrell FilmsAnchor ManElfThe Best of Will FerrellMore Films by Will Ferrell", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000WZEZFY", "B001G5T6H6", "B000HRMCTI", "B0007TS24U", "B0009K7RT8", "B00096S49O", "B000EJ9VDY", "B000KF0GSQ", "B000OVLBFI", "B000AM8RQM", "B000SH3XCM", "B00000G02A", "B001F76PDI", "B000ELL1P8", "B000A6QMQA", "B002EQFXZA", "B000L2125O", "B0009Z3LGQ", "B000ASBKHE", "B0009NSDCK", "B000FIS7HK", "B0007TFLLM", "B0012IWO08", "B002SD94AY", "B003L51GW2", "B0007V46JI", "B000ASDFGS", "B000IFRT5G", "B0008JFMEW", "B000GPVUMG", "B000AQ6904", "B002BSC57U", "B0009VCSXW", "B0008JFMF6", "B000R3BN4M", "B007M6W36Y", "B000BYRCHE", "B0009RCPV6", "B000E1YW04", "B002I0GZBI", "B0009X7BFA", "B000B5IP6U", "B0009KQOME", "B000A0GP5Y", "B000ENUYFE", "B0050JN84Q", "B000BGZRTC", "B003DS4Z6Q", "B001KMRN0M", "B000G8O0MU", "B000EWBKU8", "B0047ERZ7Q", "B000KKRD2S", "B00168PFFK", "B00311G2DY", "B00083G5CG", "B002BS47WG", "B0007Z2556", "B0009FU10U", "B000B8IA4E", "B0045SE9XC", "B000AAJTM0", "B0019C6KAC", "B000F2DE8S", "B0011VPYIK", "B0009350CQ", "B0009NJFPY", "B000ADWD2A", "B000FYZS6M", "B000VIUNZI", "B000AQ690Y", "B0009WPZPY", "B003ALEWKU", "B000F4PDEO", "B000A7Q1XI", "B000803BQM", "B0009K7RTI", "B000MNP2KS", "B000NIBUQW", "B000BKJ76C", "B0013KPSDA", "B007ZH9OFI", "B000059TMB", "B002TPTDFC", "B000A3XYE6", "B00151QYU8", "B000F5GJO6", "B0009VRHME", "B0009W5JAA", "B0009RCPXE", "B000BW7QV8", "B0009NSE42", "B001IZNIVE", "B000BYRCRO", "B000B5IOVQ", "B000B5IOW0", "B00083FZH2"], "bought_together": ["B000WZEZFY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001G5T6GW", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00B65JMEI", "B00AEFXJS6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 199481}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.5, "brand": "Son", "asin": "B000J3OTO6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MwbfwtGuL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Talladega Nights - The Ballad of Ricky Bobby [UMD for PSP]"}

{"description": "Pile together a blue-ribbon cast, a screenplay high in quirkiness, and the Sundance stamp of approval, and youve got yourself a crossover indie hit. That formula worked for Little Miss Sunshine, a frequently hilarious study of family dysfunction. Meet the Hoovers, an Albuquerque clan riddled with depression, hostility, and the tattered remnants of the American Dream; despite their flakiness, they manage to pile into a VW van for a weekend trek to L.A. in order to get moppet daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) into the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. Much of the pleasure of this journey comes from watching some skillful comic actors doing their thing: Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette as the parents (hes hoping to become a self-help authority), Alan Arkin as a grandfather all too willing to give uproariously inappropriate advice to a sullen teenage grandson (Paul Dano), and a subdued Steve Carell as a jilted gay professor on the verge of suicide. The film is a crowd-pleaser, and if anything is a little too eager to bend itself in the direction of quirk-loving Sundance audiences; it can feel forced. But the breezy momentum and the ingenious actors help push the material over any bumps in the road. -- Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000YABYLA", "B00005JMJG", "B001UV4XGU", "B00A81MV3U", "B00DL46ZN8", "B00005JNC2", "B0007TKOAA", "B001UV4XUG", "B00005ALS0", "B00118T632", "B00AEFXESQ", "B007L6VR12", "B008220BA2", "B003L20ICE", "B0000640VJ", "B008OHV49W", "B001P9KR8U", "B000A7DVR2", "B00000F5MN", "B007L6VRBM", "B00AFEY354", "B0001GOH6Q", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00337KM2S", "B000H0MKOC", "B004UXUX4Q", "B0034G4OZE", "B00011CZRE", "B00275EGWY", "0205751989", "B000FVQLQQ", "B0010X8NF0", "B004SIP95G", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B004QL7KKC", "B00079Z9VO", "B00003CXZ4", "B0021L8UOY", "B001MM3AZM", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00606P0BM", "B00005Q4CS", "B00ADRYCWC", "B001TOD92C", "B004SEUIW4", "B000P0J0EW", "B0015OKWKI", "B000CS464G", "B0007PLLBU", "B00009W5CA", "B00005JLSB", "B004A8ZWV0", "B007RKFXUS", "B0010AN7Z4", "B00012QLB4", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B003UESJH4", "B00005JNBQ", "B007VYE4PK", "B000WZEZGI", "B00AEBB9F0", "6304907729", "B003Y5H574", "B000SFOW8I", "B00005JMJ4", "B001BL96K2", "B00006FMUW", "B002VPTJOA", "B00003CXO1", "B000J103OI", "B0038N9WKU", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00008975Z", "B003ASLJQI", "B0049985XW", "B003ASLJO0", "B001J9KJ4I", "B001FZQOW2", "B00000G02H", "1557047707", "B000BYRCQU", "B00121QGPY", "B00005JL57", "B000021Y77", "B000A3XY5A", "B000MZHW40", "B0000AC8LR", "B00AEFY0KW", "B0045HCJ9E", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B00AEBB9FA", "B00005A06N", "B000ELJAEM", "B00AEFYAMA", "B00E8RKHWW", "B00005JLRE", "B005LAIHE0", "B000M341QE", "B0039UT3LK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00118T632", "B00DL46ZN8", "B0007UC8Y4", "B001AGXEAG"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 401537}, "asin": "B000JU9OJ4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51T7A7BDBWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Little Miss Sunshine [Region 2]"}
{"description": "Out patrolling a California highway, police officer Edward Malus (Nicolas Cage) stops a station wagon to return a little girl's lost doll. Moments later, a runaway truck slams into the station wagon, igniting it into a fiery wreck with the mother and child trapped inside. Edward fails to save them before the car explodes...and then spends months of his life choking down pills to get the image of their faces out of his head. But Edward is about to get a second chance. A desperate letter from his former girlfriend, Willow (Kate Beahan), arrives at his home with no postmark. Willow came into his life and left just as unexpectedly years before. But now, her daughter Rowan has gone missing, and Edward is theonly person she trusts to help locate her. She asks him to come to her home on a private island - Summersisle - a place with its own traditions where people observe a forgotten way of life. Edward seizes the opportunity to make his life right again, and soon finds himself on a seaplane bound for the islands of the Pacific Northwest. But nothing is what it seems on isolated Summersisle, where a culture, dominated by its matriarch Sister Summersisle (Ellen Burstyn), is bound together by arcane traditions and a pagan festival called \"the Day of Death and Rebirth.\" The secretive people of Summersisle only ridicule his investigation, insisting that a child named Rowan never existed there... or if she ever did was no longer alive. But what Edward doesn't know is that Willow's plea for help has invited more into his life than a chance for redemption. In unraveling Summersisle's closely held secrets, Edward is drawn into a web of ancient traditions and murderous deceit, and each step he takes closer to the lost child brings him one step closer to the unspeakable. And one step closer to the Wicker Man.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001J710Y8", "B000PMFRZQ", "B002TVQ48K", "B000GRUMRS", "B0073U2ETK", "B001J710Z2", "B004EPYZOO", "B00012QLB4", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B001KRVLCI", "B000CSUNQQ", "B001GCUO02", "B00AEBB8JM", "B000CFYAMC", "6304806434", "B004XFZ4JK", "B000OVLBF8", "B000BBOUW2", "B000BYA5G4", "B000059TG6", "B004EI2NMM", "B00BFNJHCI", "B00004Z4WR", "B001KKU9CI", "0792838068", "6304711891", "B003ZD9DSO", "B00BJB2GZG", "B00003CXIV", "6305760403", "B00BTYMPX6", "B000U7169M", "B00IKM5LXG", "B001DZOC6Y", "B007IUEEA2", "B00062IDGK", "B00003CXXG", "B003YF9PX6", "B00092ZLSK", "B00005JLRE", "B000TJ6PBK", "B00441GZ00", "B005F2JRUC", "0792844831", "B000FI8MPW", "B0000AGWMF", "B00005JN5E", "0767810856", "B000YNFXZA", "B000OVLBGM", "B00006LPGP", "B00020HAX8", "B0010YVCB6", "B0009X763M", "B00005JP3R", "B000RZGHSM", "B000EHRVP6", "B00008L3UF", "B000286S1U", "B00DNJ95S8", "B009L79YFU", "B00KCTG4PO", "B005DR64OQ", "B0019X3YX2", "B000RZGHSW", "B00406UK7S", "B000JLTRIQ", "B003UMW63O", "B0047T74CM", "B000ALM40I", "B008XAT0TQ", "B002GHHHKG", "B009XTF8KQ", "B001OST0M6", "B009IV2Z3M", "B002ZG99KO", "B00E8G5HNM", "B0002DB5PO", "B00HOGBXS6", "B008DVJOQ4", "B004SIP92O", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00I9H3VTS", "B0011NVC98", "B001JNNDJM", "B000W1SZA4", "B00FEHCQEC", "B00AEFYYH6", "B005LAIGW8", "B00005JNNT", "B004CQZFH6", "B000U1ZV62", "B000RGN2JI", "B003L20IEW", "B00006FDBT", "B00004Y87O", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00803PFZO", "B00GOYC3I8"], "bought_together": ["B001J710Y8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001J710Y8", "B00004Z4WR", "B002TVQ48K", "B000PMFRZQ"]}, "price": 9.33, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 75218}, "asin": "B000JYW5DM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TT3AM10VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Wicker Man (Full Screen Unrated/Rated Edition)"}

{"description": "Brewery worker Albert Robinson and financier Jeremy Coward seem like average British guys, until the Russian government claims they're Russian KGB agents defected to England, inSleepers. This four-episode miniseries stars Vladimir Zelenski as Albert and Sergei Rublev as Jeremy, agents suddenly in danger of losing their anonymity when KGB agent Nina dedicates her work to solving the mystery of their whereabouts. Dry comedy inSleeperstransforms a potentially serious subject into satire about post-Cold War bumbling and bureaucracy, as various secret groups in the UK and the US get a whiff of what the sneaky Russians are up to and begin interfering. Scenes alternating between the KGB, the CIA, and the MI5 make it clear that no one really knows why they're hunting these two retired men, or what threat they pose.Sleepers'humor capitalizes on outmoded Cold War obsessions with keeping tabs regardless of purpose.
