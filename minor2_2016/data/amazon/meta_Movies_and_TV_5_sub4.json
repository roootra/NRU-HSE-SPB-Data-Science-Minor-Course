{"description": "Arguably the most intelligently written film to feature the masterful stop-motion animation of Ray Harryhausen,Jason and the Argonautsis a colorful adventure that takes full advantage of Harryhausen's \"Dynarama\" process. Inspired by the Greek myth, the story begins when the fearless explorer Jason (Todd Armstrong) returns to the kingdom of Thessaly to make his rightful claim to the throne, but the gods proclaim that he must first find the magical Golden Fleece. Consulting Hera, the queen of gods, Jason recruits the brave Argonauts to crew his ship, and they embark on their eventful journey. Along the way they encounter a variety of mythic creatures, including the 100-foot bronze god Talos, the batlike Harpies, the seven-headed reptilian Hydra, and an army of skeletons wielding sword and shield. This last sequence remains one of the finest that Harryhausen ever created, and it's still as thrilling as anything from the age of digital special effects. Harryhausen was the true auteur of his fantasy films, and his brilliant animation evokes a timeless sense of wonder.Jason and the Argonautsis a prime showcase for Harryhausen's talent--a wondrous product of pure imagination and filmmaking ingenuity.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001DB6J50", "0767847431", "B00004TJJV", "B002ZD3V10", "B00006JDRG", "B000062XE5", "B001DZOCY6", "B000QGEB1W", "B00007JMD8", "B00018D3ZA", "B00005LKHN", "B0045HCJSA", "B003DVNUUK", "B00005Y6XR", "B000SAGGL4", "B00005JKU0", "B000095WW6", "B00006AUGK", "B008XTVWHK", "B004B93RDS", "B0037JO0X4", "B000SFJ4K4", "B000FOPPEC", "B00AEBB8VK", "B0001BKBFC", "B000BMY2KG", "B0007R4T1W", "B00005JKFR", "B000VULA94", "B000AQKU72", "B0024FADBK", "B000O78KWE", "B0044O1Q60", "B000062XF2", "B0001NBMDK", "B000B7MX7A", "B000063UR0", "B00ALTQRUC", "B000HEWEDK", "B001BGS17Q", "B005OT7YX8", "B00004TJK0", "B005E7SFDI", "B000056AXZ", "B00007ELD2", "0783240961", "B000EHQTZO", "B00152VXUS", "B00005R1O8", "0783240953", "B000YDOOHI", "B00A33J8R0", "B00009NHC0", "B0024LIBDQ", "B00518A70E", "B0007R4T26", "B000A6T1ZE", "B0074JOUHE", "B0001I55XI", "B00D9EJFZA", "B002945DU2", "B000O78KY2", "B000Y2Q9J0", "B00AEBB94G", "B00005RRG7", "B0006B2A7E", "B00005JMH8", "B0045HCJKS", "6305869367", "B000FVQLKW", "B0006GANX2", "B000MGTQ7U", "6305761078", "B000056NWI", "B000AYELJ2", "B001AR0D40", "B005R2SHIS", "B00094ARW8", "B00A33J90G", "B000A9QK7I", "B00BQ7GU1Y", "B006TTC5J0", "B004FZWDPG", "B0002KPHW4", "0790742829", "B00B2M7DKA", "B004QF71ZW", "B0024FAG2G", "B00005JN8Z", "B00000F17E", "B003L7DK60", "B00006JMQG"], "bought_together": ["B001DB6J50", "0767847431"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001DB6J50", "0767847431", "B00004TJJV", "B002ZD3V10"]}, "price": 29.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12182}, "asin": "0767810864", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WNMTYA9qL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jason and the Argonauts"}

{"description": "Based on a memoir by former undercover cop Joe Pistone (whose daring and unprecedented infiltration of the New York Mob scene earned him a place in the federal witness protection program),Donnie Brascois like a de- romanticized, de-mythologized version ofThe Godfather. It offers an uncommonly detailed, privileged glimpse inside the world of organized crime from the perspective of the little guys at the bottom of Mafia hierarchy rather than from the kingpins at the top.Donnie Brascois not only one of the great modern-day gangster movies to put in the company ofThe Godfatherfilms andGoodFellas, but it is also one of the great undercover police movies--arguably surpassingSerpicoandPrince of the Cityin richness of character, detail, and moral complexity. Donnie (Johnny Depp, a splendid actor) is practically adopted by Lefty Ruggiero (Al Pacino), a gregarious, low-level &quot;made&quot; man who grows to love his young prot&eacute;g&eacute; like a son. (Pacino really sinks into this guy's skin and polyester slacks, and creates his freshest, most fully realized character since his 1970s heyday.) As Donnie acclimates himself to Lefty's world, he distances himself from his wife (a terrific Anne Heche) and family for their own protection. Almost imperceptibly his sense of identity slips away from him. Questioning his own confused loyalties, unable to trust anybody else because he himself is an imposter, Donnie loses his way in a murky and treacherous no-man's land. The film is directed by Mike Newell, who also headed upFour Weddings and a Funeraland the gritty, true crime melodramaDance with a Stranger.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000AM6JI", "B000C20VPA", "B000P0J09M", "B000P0J0AG", "B00004U103", "B00003CXWV", "B008R65XYC", "B0000DI87S", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000C20VRS", "B002QEHPQU", "B002CPMB9O", "B007TBIUSM", "B0006GAOJA", "B000286RP2", "B00AEBB95K", "B000M341QE", "B0018CMJSU", "B00000IRE6", "B00005R87R", "B00013RC2U", "B00G1C2URC", "B004P7CNC2", "B000CNESTE", "0767830555", "B00008RH3L", "B0000WN140", "B000H5TH20", "B00008975Z", "B0001FGBUW", "B0019L21GA", "B000F7CECK", "B0000AMJEK", "B000E5KQHI", "B004SIP7TE", "B002VWNIEA", "B004G7XCRQ", "B004SIP95G", "B00CCMKPO0", "B0009UZG0K", "B001C0I61M", "B006TTC5HC", "B000A2UBN4", "B001EZE5BU", "B0000VD04M", "B00005V9HH", "B006ISJQ1W", "0451192575", "B000NQRR1Q", "B00008CMRK", "B004SIP8ZM", "B0002234LS", "0780621611", "B0019L770A", "B00006JDU8", "B000ERVKBC", "B00AEFYYWQ", "6305065551", "B00AEBB8LA", "B000ZS8GWQ", "0792838076", "B00011CZRE", "B0000YEE6M", "0780628551", "B000LP6KNU", "B000FDEV3Y", "079284646X", "B00003CXRG", "B0000714BS", "B002VWNICC", "B0019L21H4", "6305313687", "B000067IZ3", "6305263248", "B001HN69AY", "B004SIP93S", "B004A8ZWSS", "B003ELKNH2", "0767802519", "B003LR5BD0", "B0015OKWL2", "0783226845", "0783229526", "B000P0J0EW", "B0009A40ES", "B000EHSVRI", "B00CMDPT3Q", "B00AEBBA72", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B0041QSZS8", "B00441GYPG", "B004SIP9Z6", "B0034G4OSG", "B00005JLSB", "B002AF4Y9G", "B000093FLA", "B003ASLJQS", "B004FQX5B6", "B000A9QK6E", "B00003CWRX"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000C20VRS", "B0018CMJSU", "B000C20VPA", "B000P0J09M"]}, "price": 8.49, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 264032}, "asin": "0767802551", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518YHWH8AWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Donnie Brasco"}

{"description": "If anyone ever doubts whether Nicole Kidman is a good actress, they should immediately be required to watch this outrageously wicked comedy from 1995, for which Kidman deservedly won a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Leading Role. While director Gus Van Sant handles the fact-based satire with razor-sharp precision, Kidman delivers a deliciously devious performance as Suzanne Stone, a small-town New Hampshire housewife who fancies herself the next Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, Diane Sawyer, and Maria Shriver all rolled up into one meticulously coiffed package. So determined is she to have a successful career on TV that she'll stop at nothing--even the calculated murder of her husband (Matt Dillon)--to get the attention she feels entitled to. To carry out her scheme she recruits some unwitting local teenagers including one boy (Joaquin Phoenix, matching Kidman's excellence) whose infatuation with Suzanne leads to sexual escapades and predictably troublesome consequences. It's a satirical comedy in Van Sant's capable hands, but it's so close to tabloid reality that the film never seems implausible--which only gives it a funnier, more blood-chilling quality of humor. Featuring Illeanna Douglas, George Segal, andSeinfeldalumnus Wayne Knight in memorable supporting roles, this is one of the best comedies of the '90s--especially if you prefer comedies with a decidedly darker edge.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305161933", "B004AE3QYE", "B004P7CMUU", "B006YTGLE0", "B000067J3P", "B00005JNQA", "B0007P0X9G", "B0002DB52M", "B009R8Q8Y8", "6305594333", "B000NO1XG8", "B00006L91I", "B00004Y87P", "B0013D8LKO", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B0001GF2D8", "B004SUDQ0O", "B0002W4UDE", "B009B1EPQ4", "B001RJ1Y62", "B00005QJJB", "B000068QPV", "B00AEFXX9Q", "0767821009", "6305308837", "B0043X1FNQ", "B000HC2LHG", "B00441GYZ6", "B00005JMIJ", "B000E5N684", "B006YTGL3G", "B0001EFUFK", "B00827OWO8", "B0011NVC8Y", "0767812158", "B00HQLZC18", "0792845811", "B00005JKJA", "B00AEFYD2M", "B00AEFY8MM", "B0000542CB", "B00011CZRE", "B00007AJFB", "B0045HCIYA", "B00AEBB8ZG", "B000H5TH1Q", "B005DR64OQ", "B00BSN0VZW", "B004SIP92O", "B004SIP86Q", "B0021L9M2I", "B004SUDQC2", "B000HT38EO", "B00GNZM0D6", "B004SIP6QI", "6305213305", "0780627776", "B00008L3UE", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B0007R4SX6", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00AEBB9LO", "B000BOH904", "B00006472O", "B00AEBB8SS", "B00AEFXBPM", "B00E1HIWXU", "B004O26LAI", "B003AWRM9M", "B008220DGE", "B00003CWN3", "0767815718", "0784011710", "B000U1ZV76", "B000PAAJZ6", "6305428107", "B00005JLHW", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B003LR5BD0", "B00H9HZITU", "6305161895", "B000ASDFGI", "B00H83EUQW", "B0003JANWS", "B004ALIG4W", "B0010KP360", "B0050UEVNM", "B00096S49Y", "B000N3SU92", "B00007AJF8", "B00AEFXESQ", "B000068V9U", "B00AEBBA2W", "B003EYVXTG", "B004SUDQ22", "6304696515", "B00J0IN6Z4", "B00G7QPXUI", "B000JBXXYK", "B0072BNJZ8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["6305594333", "B004AE3QYE", "B006YTGLE0", "B00AEBB8P6"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 126577}, "asin": "076781777X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CH7THFMDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "To Die For"}

Kathleen Robertson has a certain impish charm (which unfortunately wears thin at times), Johnathon Schaech and Matt Keeslar are fun as the rivals who ultimately become best buds, but it's Eric Mabius who quietly steals every scene he's in as a TV movie director who's so thoughtful and kind, yet self-absorbed, that he might comfort his bride-to-be on their wedding day by sweetly telling her, \"Honey, Amazon.com says I stole every scene I'm in, isn't that great?\"--Geof Miller", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000QUEQ4K", "B00134SU2C", "B000WCN8QE", "B004OBQDCK", "B00009MEJ6", "B000F6II1M", "B00HUTPKA4", "B000059XTJ", "B00005ASPE", "B00B0LKUKI", "B00GHP8SH4", "B00CPTUO1Y", "B00GSA3K6C", "B00I4CWIVU", "B00I2U91Z0", "B0016MJ6T2", "B00GB0ORJ8", "B00FGG60XY", "B00005JLHW", "B001AZKB8K", "B0015D20D6", "B000HT38EO", "B00009KOY5", "B0081FSMNI", "B003B2UK1S", "B0083V2W3G", "B004L03B3S", "B0007GP7I2", "B00023P4I8", "B000053VAW", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B0092Q82LC", "B000001ERO", "B00001QEGI", "B000XUOLOI", "B000002MAG"], "bought_together": ["B000QUEQ4K", "B00134SU2C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000QUEQ4K", "B00134SU2C", "B00009MEJ6", "B000F6II1M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 184386}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 39.99, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "076784257X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41MKwiBDrNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Splendor"}

{"description": "Once upon a time, in the 1980s and early 1990s, American independent movies did not seek to merely ape Hollywood formulas. They were more than just feature-length resumes for shrewd, enterprising filmmakers who had nothing to say, but dreamed of saying it with a big-studio budget. Back then, independent films provided a different kind of movie experience; they challenged and provoked audiences--and none more so than 1991'sThe Rapture, written and directed by Michael Tolkin, the man who wrote the screenplay forThe Player, Robert Altman's scathing anti-Hollywood comedy. Mimi Rogers plays Sharon, a lost soul who gives up her hedonistic life of sex and drugs when she finds God and becomes a fundamentalist Christian fanatic. Her pilgrim's progress, presented in a deadpan, nonjudgmental style, culminates quite literally in the title event--the Second Coming, the Apocalypse, the end of the world, or whatever you want to call it. Rogers's fearless performance becomes all the more provocative when you recall that the actress is a lifelong member of the Church of Scientology.The Raptureis a mind-boggling, wildly ambitious movie that's open to myriad interpretations. But no matter what you make of it, it's sure to leave you engaged and shaken.--Jim Emerson", "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 493451}, "asin": "078060718X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5186BJ8A12L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rapture [VHS]"}
{"description": "Edward Norton was nominated for a 1998 Best Actor Oscar for his role as  Derek Vinyard, a thoughtful kid turned neo-Nazi after his father is slain.  Edward Furlong plays his younger brother, Danny, determined to follow in his brother's footsteps.  The easy routes the film seems prepared to take never materialize.  It continually makes Derek's transformation both in and out of his racist beliefs believable and persuasive.  Stacy Keach is given the head vampire role of the local skinhead chapter, Cameron, and he's the closest this film comes to an overt overstatement.  Norton, however, is fantastic, embodying a person who roller-coasters through hatred like he can't wait to ride again.  His diatribes are not unlike what can be heard on any given conservative radio station on any given day, but he doesn't spew them as cant or screed.  Only when his violent emotions take charge, negating any sense or stand, is the underlying fallacy and nature of his beliefs made plain. This film was undermined by the film's own director, Tony Kaye, who made such a braying ass of himself and his work that it distorted the public's view of what is an interesting social and psychological lesson in the war between ideas and ideologues, reason and racism.--Keith Simanton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303686796", "B00004W5UA", "B00000J2L7"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 321982}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.59, "brand": "", "asin": "0780625129", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516KFV9DGKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "American History X [VHS]"}

In the year 1999, Lambert owns a corporation that has created a shield to protect the Earth following the depletion of the ozone layer. But the shield is seized by an evil cartel, and Virginia Madsen plays a scientist who assists MacLeod in his mission to destroy the cartel. Sean Connery also reprises his role fromHighlanderas the Scottish Immortal named Ramirez (?!), but by the time he starts engaging in dashing swordplay you may wonder if he's wandered in from another movie altogether.Highlanderfans welcomed the laserdisc and DVD release of this &quot;renegade&quot; director's cut, which attempts to clarify the original version's confusing plot.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004U7MQY2", "B004U7MQYC", "B001JFZ118", "B0010YVCAM", "B000NOKAK8", "B0007DA3V6", "B00092A1J4", "B000OYCMNU", "B001URA5W0", "B000LP6L2U", "B001AQO3XS", "B00006LPCK", "B0001BKBGQ", "B00HEPDGKA", "B00005O5B6", "B00009MEJT", "B0000CABIJ", "B00020HCBI", "0790738511", "B008JFUS0U", "B00IKM5LXG", "B0085A9HU6", "B0001ZX0GA", "B0001NBLYK", "B004P7CMDM", "0783225741", "B00J4LMHMK", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00EKUXDSW", "B00004WEJZ", "B008JFUNHI", "B00J9BZ4KC", "B0000640VR", "B001B3LIOC", "B00070FX5U", "B00006RCOC", "B005LAIGW8", "B005LAII44", "B00005N5S5", "6304711891", "B0013RF25M", "B001FB55HQ", "B00003CXIV", "B00004Y631", "B0090SI56Y", "B0001A9I5W", "B001BEK8HO", "B0053TWVIM", "B00004STDN", "B0000VD12I", "B003L20IEW", "B000UW1NKE", "B0000VCZK2", "6304936532", "B00A2H9OSK", "B000QUCRB4", "B000M2DLJ8", "6305558167", "B003QO8TOQ", "B000AYELFQ", "0783225814", "1573624667", "B00BUAEYVK", "B000P7V4R6", "0783226888", "B00AIBZKV0", "B005LS4MQY", "B000VI70QS", "6304712499", "B0045HCJ9O", "B004LWZW4M", "B00004TJJV", "B00HDU9UOW", "0783114885", "0767817710", "B000E6ESEY", "B0045HCIWM", "B0045HCJRG", "B00GJNQ4B6", "6305245487", "B002O3Z4WK", "B0000844I8", "B0006UEVUE", "630469654X", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00009ATIM", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B0000524EB", "0783226063", "B0001Z37HM", "B00003CXC5", "B000U1ZV8K", "B0050ODZ6M", "B00008G8M4", "B000LC4Z7Q", "B004EPYZT4", "B00008WFU5", "076780970X", "B00F3L8P26"], "bought_together": ["B001JFZ118", "B004U7MQY2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001JFZ118", "B004U7MQY2", "B004U7MQYC", "B0010YVCAM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 273607}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0782008380", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516F7VY0HCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Highlander II: Renegade Version"}

Based on the memoir of combat veteran Ron Kovic, the film stars Tom Cruise as Kovic, whose gunshot wound in Vietnam left him paralyzed from the chest down. He is deeply embittered by neglect in a veteran's hospital and by the shattering of his patriotic idealism because of the horror and futility of the Vietnam conflict. While painfully and awkwardly adjusting to his disability and a changing definition of masculinity, Kovic joins the burgeoning movement of antiwar protest, culminating in a climactic appearance at the 1976 Democratic national convention.

{"description": "John Wayne and Kirk Douglas make a delightful duo in this comedic Western in which Wayne seeks revenge on a ruthless mine owner (Bruce Cabot) who had him framed and sent to prison. Upon his release, Wayne recruits Douglas in a scheme to raid and rob one of Cabot's gold-laden wagons, despite the fact that Douglas had been offered good money to kill Wayne. He joins Wayne instead (the potential profits being much greater), and they set out to ambush the War Wagon, so named because it's heavily armored, mounted with a Gatling gun, and guarded by a dozen gunmen on horses. Costarring Keenan Wynn and Howard Keel as a wise-cracking Indian,The War Wagonwas a Western precursor to the action buddy films of the 1980s and '90s, serving up plenty of exciting action and constant comic relief. The interplay between Wayne and Douglas is sharp and sarcastic, and their motley crew of accomplices provides yet another source of character-driven humor. Not one of the greatest Westerns ever made, but certainly one of the most lightly entertaining.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008CMR6", "B000O599YE", "B00008CMR4", "B00AEFXUL2", "B00008MTW5", "B000O599Y4", "078322592X", "B00008MTW7", "B0045HCJSK", "B000O59A0C", "B000ANVPP6", "0783230478", "B00008MTW6", "B000O599NK", "B00AEBBA0E", "B000ANVPPQ", "B000O599YO", "B00AEFXSVE", "B000059TFU", "B0082LUFA4", "B00AEBB8YM", "B000O599WQ", "B000O599NA", "B00AEFY6ZQ", "B00005ASGH", "B00AEFYBA6", "B00C6QYMJG", "B000O599YY", "B000U1ZV6M", "B00AEFYL6K", "6304696612", "B0009ML2JC", "B000O599ZS", "B001PO54OM", "B000O599US", "B009YX8MSG", "B00008CMT3", "B00008CMT4", "B0015TJBXW", "B000O599VM", "B0009ML2KQ", "B00004ZBVE", "B000BPL2FG", "B000O599W6", "B0007MAO0C", "B00BFWKE62", "B001PO55LE", "B006VRRGOO", "B000O599XU", "B000O77LY2", "B000O599N0", "B001R0AY9Y", "B000O599NU", "B00005JLV5", "B000O599X0", "B0018O4RT2", "B003ASLJS6", "B00005N89K", "B0001FVDX2", "B00BTYU3UI", "B00393SG0G", "B000O599Z8", "B000BPL2HO", "B00005N5S3", "B00AEFYPHA", "B00AMQGFYM", "B000N3SSBW", "B006PA0TRI", "B0047BXR94", "B003ASLJRC", "B005FUTC2W", "B0007TKNGA", "B000056H2H", "B00008CMR1", "B004DY1VIO", "0783230400", "B000O599MG", "B00AEBB932", "B000OT6V0U", "0783228007", "B00005LOL0", "B007KFZ7Y2", "B000O599M6", "B00BGQ2P9G", "B000BITVBA", "B000O599LW", "B000059TFW", "B006PA19VS", "B000FTCLQC", "B00195I3OK", "B000E5N6KW", "B00C3ALLFS", "B004GSVX8A", "B00008CMT1", "B000FZETR0", "B000O179JK", "B000H9AD5G", "B000O599ZI", "B004TJ1H3W", "B003ASLJNQ"], "bought_together": ["B00008CMR4", "B00008CMR6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007KFZ7Y2", "B00008CMR6", "078322592X", "B00AEFXUL2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7286}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.35, "brand": "WAYNE,JOHN", "asin": "0783228031", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51cUCsOWQ6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The War Wagon"}
{"description": "The original cowriter and director ofFear and Loathing in Las Vegaswas Alex Cox, whose earlier filmSid and Nancysuggests that Cox could have been a perfect match in filming  Hunter&nbsp;S. Thompson's psychotropic masterpiece of \"gonzo\" journalism. Unfortunately Cox departed due to the usual \"creative differences,\" and this ill-fated adaptation was thrust upon Terry Gilliam, whose formidable gifts as a visionary filmmaker were squandered on the seemingly unfilmable elements of Thompson's ether-fogged narrative. The result is a one-joke movie without the joke--an endless series of repetitive scenes involving rampant substance abuse and the hallucinogenic fallout of a road trip that's run crazily out of control. Johnny Depp plays Thompson's alter ego, \"gonzo\" journalist Raoul Duke, and Benicio Del Toro is his sidekick and so-called lawyer Dr. Gonzo. During the course of a trip to Las Vegas to cover a motorcycle race, they ingest a veritable chemistry set of drugs, and Gilliam does his best to show us the hallucinatory state of their zonked-out minds. This allows for some dazzling imagery and the rampant humor of stumbling buffoons, and the mumbling performances of Depp and Del Toro wholeheartedly embrace the tripped-out, paranoid lunacy of Thompson's celebrated book. But over two hours of this insanity tends to grate on the nerves--like being the only sober guest at a party full of drunken idiots. So while Gilliam's film may achieve some modest cult status over the years, it's only becauseFear and Loathingis best enjoyed by those who are just as stoned as the characters in the movie.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006H32EI", "B006ISJQ1W", "B00003CXWV", "0767837398", "B002AF4Y9G", "B000A7DVR2", "B001EDFSIQ", "0679785892", "B0057ZAA6W", "6305313687", "B00029RTAI", "B0007DFJ0G", "B002QEHPQU", "B00008975Z", "B001HN69AY", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00005JM23", "B000F7CECK", "B000JMK6LW", "B000093FLA", "B000P0J09M", "B003HKN52U", "0783225903", "B00005R87R", "B004SIP95G", "B00000IRE6", "B000031EFY", "B00005ATQB", "B005Y4I6VW", "B0006HBZE2", "B00005Q4CS", "B004FQX5B6", "B009NNXQJW", "B0000VD04M", "B00006JDU8", "B00005V9HH", "B00011CZRE", "B002T9H2LA", "B000C20VPA", "B002CPMB9O", "B000AXWHSA", "B000ASDFI6", "B000P0J0D8", "0792838068", "B003W88QVC", "B00029RTCG", "B0011E5M66", "B0007PALZ2", "B00005JMJG", "B007D0FVRM", "B001J9KJ4I", "B006ISJQBM", "B000EMGJAO", "B0000CDUT5", "B000KB4898", "B0000AC8LR", "B004P7CNC2", "B004SIP7TE", "B00AEFXE9U", "B004SIP8ES", "B00AEFYS2M", "B000C20VRS", "B0000AC8LI", "B00ALU48M0", "B0009A40ES", "B000LP6KNU", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00AEBB8NI", "B0000640VJ", "B004SIP6LS", "B000286RP2", "B000GGSMC6", "0780621611", "B001HN694K", "B00009W5CA", "B004XVMCH6", "B001GCUO0W", "B000GBEWGQ", "B0006GAOJA", "B008R65XYC", "B000IY04Q8", "B000006NN1", "B000S6M1Y4", "B0012E2GFK", "B0007UC8Y4", "B0043X1FM2", "B0001CNRRU", "B00ALU46VI", "0767835093", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005NTOH", "B000MMMT9G", "B005LAIIJY", "B00AG4714S", "B00000K3TS", "B000053VAZ", "B00009MGEM", "B001M4YZ90", "B002ZG980U", "1451659717"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXWV"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0679785892", "B00029RTAI", "0783225903", "B000A7DVR2"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3274}, "asin": "0783229526", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51LL2U2I2AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"}

It just goes to show.Joe Kiddis a muddle and a drag, the shoddiest Eastwood vehicle since Rowdy Yates trod in his last cow flop.  Kidd, first seen as a duded-up drunk sleeping one off in jail, is supposed to be a horse rancher and an expert tracker--just the fellow a rapacious land-grabber (Robert Duvall committing lazy villainy) needs to chase down the uppity Latino (John Saxon) who's trying to reclaim the grabbed land for its rightful owners.  Neither the characters nor the overland pursuit makes any sense, thanks to chasms in the continuity and no direction to speak of.  An absurdly arbitrary assault-by-locomotive provides the climax; as Eastwood observed, \"Jesus, anything at this point--let's end it.\"--Richard T.

{"description": "This 1989 drama penned by pre-Basic Instinctscreenwriter Joe Eszterhas is a powerful tale of family identity and loyalty threatened by a ghost from the Third Reich. Jessica Lange stars as a Chicago criminal attorney whose beloved immigrant father (Armin Mueller-Stahl, in his American film debut) is accused of once having been a monstrous SS officer for Hitler. While Lange's character does a good job defending the old man in court against witnesses who charge him with numerous unspeakable acts, her own certainty that  he is innocent slowly crumbles, leaving her with a horrifying personal dilemma. Directed by Costa-Gavras (Z), the film displays some of his distracting tendency toward unnecessarily broad storytelling, but Eszterhas's script is disciplined and moving, and Lange and Mueller-Stahl are stunning in their depiction of a loving relationship deeply shaken by history.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00006349J"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 488600}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.96, "brand": "", "asin": "0784011486", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31BE03EB0SL.gif", "title": "Music Box [VHS]"}
{"description": "Proving that he may be the most fearless actor of his or any other generation, Harvey Keitel gives an amazing, no-holds-barred performance in director Abel Ferrara's uncompromising 1992 film about a New York cop on the edge of self-annihilation. The film's title is meant to be taken literally: Keitel's character has no redeeming values whatsoever, save for his desperate need for redemption. Leonard Maltin'sMovie & Video Guideis correct in calling this an \"over-the-top Catholic guilt movie,\" but it's been made with such conviction that Ferrara and Keitel transcend the sheer unpleasantness of the material to give it a kind of tragic divinity. Here's a character so vile and corrupted that he consumes or re-sells the drugs he confiscates, but when he's assigned to investigate the brutal rape of a nun who refuses to press charges, he feels that this is his opportunity to redeem his rotten soul. Deservedly rated NC-17 due to its rough content and a frontal nude scene that even Keitel's most loyal fans could do without, this film tends to divide viewers into love-it-or-hate-it categories, but few could deny its raw power and the deeply anguished humanity that Keitel brings to his role. Whatever your reaction may be, few would deny this is an unforgettable film.--Jeff Shannon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 241507}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Bad Lieutenant", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001FGBUW", "B002TVQ48K", "B000286RP2", "B00005O5AY", "6305594333", "B0001US62I", "6305505802", "0767830555", "0767802519", "B00JV0547O", "0783230443", "B00008975Z", "0792838068", "B000A2UBN4", "B0006GAOJA", "B000063JDE", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B003KGBISE", "B000P0J0D8", "B00006RCNV", "B002AF4Y9G", "B0000DI87S", "B004KDYR20", "B00008RH3L", "B00008K7AO", "0792833287", "B0064MT1FI", "B00005UQ9T", "B00005R2IS", "B00005QBZA", "B00002RAO2", "B001B1UO7G", "B0057ZAA6W", "B000PAAJZ6", "B00IKM5OCO", "B003L20IEC", "B00GOT11TA", "B00062IVM6", "B0000542CB", "0790729342", "B00005Y6XB", "B0009OUBC4", "B00AEBB95K", "B0045HCJSU", "B00000IC7G", "B0001FGBW0", "B00005V9HH", "B00LEW3L5Y", "B000059TFP", "B003TRMLQM", "B00125WATQ", "B000QXDCLK", "B001AS32QK", "B004SIP6WW", "B003ELKNH2", "B000022TS6", "B000JU7JIW", "B000C20VRS", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B00005QCVX", "B00007L4KI", "B0001EFV7C", "B00112S8RS", "B0024EWP6W", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B0009X768W", "B000UO4F7U", "B000286RPM", "B00009W5CA", "B009POCG0Y", "B001TOD92C", "B00027JYBW", "0792846435", "B000BR9S96", "B001152TL6", "B006KH6CF4", "B00HVOFP6W", "B000A7DVR2", "B000929UOQ", "B0041QSZS8", "B00699G622", "B0006HBV3C", "B00005JLJW", "B000CNESTE", "B0007P0X9G", "B00HOGBXS6", "B004YCKKFK", "B00004XPPB", "B00005JN2Z", "B00005YJMX", "B00005Q4CS", "B00005QAOZ", "B00GDDNFDW", "B00151QYSK", "6305313687", "B00049QQHI", "B000BBOUW2", "B000089770", "B00003CXZ4", "B0000AQS1H"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002TVQ48K", "B0001FGBUW", "B001V32UF8", "B002T9H2LA"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519HBKXXMTL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "0784011559"}

{"description": "When it was announced that Tom Cruise would play the vampire Lestat in this adaptation of Anne Rice's bestselling novel, even Rice chimed in with a highly publicized objection. The author wisely and justifiably recanted her negative opinion when she saw Cruise's excellent performance, which perceptively addresses the pain and chronic melancholy that plagues anyone cursed with immortal bloodlust. Brad Pitt and Kirsten Dunst are equally good at maintaining the dark and brooding tone of Rice's novel. And in this rare mainstream project for a major studio, director Neil Jordan compensates for a lumbering plot by honoring the literate, Romantic qualities of Rice's screenplay. Considered a disappointment while being embraced by Rice's loyal followers, the movie is too slow to be a satisfying thriller, but it is definitely one of the most lavish, intelligent horror films ever made.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000069I1I", "B000TGJ80S", "B00027JZ3E", "B00AEBBA72", "B0050MB3MM", "B0002KVUKM", "B002U4UZSQ", "6305258287", "B0009MDPYM", "B002ZG97CO", "B00004WG2F", "B001VLFE7G", "B00005JM5B", "B0085A9HU6", "B00006JDU8", "B00011CZRE", "B005CFBZWK", "0783229526", "B00AEFYMGO", "0345385403", "B004P7CMOQ", "B0009A40ES", "B002GSXKNI", "B001GCUO0W", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00005JL78", "B004BLJQOK", "B005COLESQ", "0783233477", "B003Y5H5EW", "B000BRBA9C", "B004P7CN7W", "0767811097", "0345337662", "B004P7CN5O", "B002T9H2LA", "B00004W4UD", "B004QSQMKE", "B002AF4Y9G", "0800177789", "B000035Z5G", "B000BKVQS4", "B00003CXSD", "B00001PE4D", "0800141806", "B00BHBOOIU", "B000P0J0EM", "B003M987PQ", "B006VRRGNK", "B008QE9XD2", "0792839137", "B00005JLKN", "B002O3Z4ZW", "0783225482", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00009AOBI", "6305313687", "B0002KVULG", "B001AGXEAG", "B00005JLSB", "B00018D42W", "B00AEBBAEK", "B003Y5H54W", "B00AEFY5B6", "B002VWNIDG", "B00AEFXYJA", "0800177029", "B000JLQQ94", "6305718954", "B000OCY7TY", "B000NOKFHQ", "B000P0J0D8", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00003CXWV", "B000AYELVA", "B005NKIPUY", "B0013FCWUW", "B0007WFX62", "B008R65XYC", "B0041KKYEM", "B00BZZMXMW", "B002NZK5V4", "B000P0J09M", "B00000G3R0", "B00005UQ9W", "0345443683", "B004SIP7TE", "B0001US62I", "B003PIUINS", "0307291650", "B000FKO5QK", "B0012Q7M02", "B0000AC8LI", "B001MYIXAC", "B005LAIHXQ", "B0009X76XC", "B000FFJYBG", "B002NZK5VO", "B00AEFXQ9S"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000069I1I", "B00011CZRE", "B00004WG2F", "B000P0J09M"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 82136}, "asin": "0790729687", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516RX1MMY2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Interview With the Vampire"}
{"description": "From its cleverly choreographed opening sequence to its heart-stopping climax on a rampant carousel, this 1951 Hitchcock classic readily earns its reputation as one of the director's finest examples of timeless cinematic suspense. It's not just a ripping-good thriller but a film student's delight and a perversely enjoyable battle of wits between tennis pro Guy (Farley Granger) and his mysterious, sycophantic admirer, Bruno (Robert Walker), who proposes a &quot;criss-cross&quot; scheme of traded murders. Bruno agrees to kill Guy's unfaithful wife, in return for which Guy will (or so it seems) kill Bruno's spiteful father. With an emphasis on narrative and visual strategy, Hitchcock controls the escalating tension with a master's flair for cinematic design, and the plot (coscripted by Raymond Chandler) is so tightly constructed that you'll be white-knuckled even after multiple viewings.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002HOEQ2", "B000CCW2SY", "B000ECX0O2", "B0045HCJ9E", "B00871C09S", "B0087ZG7R0", "B001D8W7EK", "B00000CQJZ", "B000A9QK7I", "B00AEBB97S", "B000CCW2TS", "B001D8W7F4", "B000ECX0Q0", "B0002HOEQM", "B001D8W7EU", "B0087ZG7OI", "B00000C0QO", "B002GSXKQA", "B000CCW2U2", "B0002HOER6", "B0087ZG7PW", "B000ECX0S8", "6305999872", "B00AEBB89C", "B003ZEQMH8", "B0002HOEQW", "B00004XPPK", "B000A1INJE", "B00008LDNZ", "B0002HOEQC", "B000CCW2UW", "B000FFJYA2", "B009RWRINE", "B000CCW2UC", "B0002HOEPS", "B0050FXDDQ", "B002VWNIAY", "B005EVY8MQ", "B0006HBV3C", "B0010YSD7W", "B00K6D1QV8", "B000025RE7", "B005H8G78O", "B000MGBSDK", "B007Y1NR1W", "B000PMFRVU", "B00005LC4D", "B0009ML1Z2", "B00065GX64", "B0045HCJQW", "B00AEBBA7W", "B00003CXBZ", "B000244F2S", "B0000549B1", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B008BFSMBA", "B000ECX0QU", "B000FFJYAW", "B004NWPY3E", "B00006RCO1", "B00005AUK9", "B0045HCJ8U", "B00AEFYO5I", "B0008ENIAC", "B00005JKF6", "B000CNE088", "B00DZP1C9K", "B00005RDRL", "B000UVV25Q", "B002945DUM", "B0045HCJHG", "B00AEFXD1O", "B0002ERWZ0", "078323502X", "B000KGGJ1I", "B00003CXBU", "B006TTC5WC", "B000KIX8VK", "B00000JNVC", "B00004W229", "B004CZRE44", "B00AEBB8OC", "B00AMEZDK6", "B000FFJYAC", "B006FE83UE", "B0007US7EY", "B0010AN7Z4", "B000CNE08I", "B0014Z4OMU", "B00553K8DQ", "B000B8380A", "B000244EYW", "B0009S4IKQ", "B00074DY0M", "B00004TJKI", "B005152C9G"], "bought_together": ["B0002HOEQ2", "B0045HCJ9E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00871C09S", "B0002HOEQ2", "B000CCW2SY", "B0045HCJ9E"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 124487}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.89, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "0790731029", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J4BhbK2UL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Strangers on a Train"}
{"description": "Before makingBatman, director Tim Burton and star Michael Keaton teamed up for this popular black comedy about a young couple (Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) whose premature death leads them to a series of wildly bizarre afterlife exploits. As ghosts in their own New England home, they're faced with the challenge of scaring off the pretentious new owners (Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones), whose daughter (Winona Ryder) has an affinity for all things morbid. Keaton plays the mischievous Beetlejuice, a freelance &quot;bio-exorcist&quot; who's got an evil agenda behind his plot to help the young undead newlyweds.

{"description": "You know exactly what you're getting inNational Lampoon's Christmas Vacation: another goofball, slapstick comedy of chaos and catastrophe with Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) and family. This time, there's no traveling involved: Clark and Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) prepare for a nice Christmas with the kids (played by none other than Juliette Lewis andRoseannestar Johnny Galecki), when their home is invaded by backwoods cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) and his brood, along with assorted other crazy and/or stuffy relatives.

{"description": "Whether or not you can sympathize with its fascistic-vigilante approach to law enforcement,Dirty Harry(directed by star Clint Eastwood's longtime friend and directorial mentor, Don Siegel) is one hell of a cop thriller. The movie makes evocative use of its San Francisco locations as cop Harry Callahan (Eastwood) tracks the elusive &quot;Scorpio killer&quot; who has been terrorizing the city by the Bay. As the psychopath's trail grows hotter, Harry becomes increasingly impatient and intolerant of the frustrating obstacles (departmental red tape, individuals' civil rights) that he feels are keeping him from doing his job. A characteristically taut and tense piece of filmmaking from Siegel (Invasion of the Body Snatchers,The Shootist,Escape from Alcatraz), it also remains a fascinating slice of American pop culture. It was a big hit (followed by four sequels) that obviously reflected--or exploited--the almost obsessive or paranoid fears and frustrations many Americans felt about crime in the streets. At a time when &quot;law and order&quot; was a familiar slogan for political candidates, Harry Callahan may have represented neither, but from his point of view his job was simple: stop criminals. To him that end justified any means he deemed necessary.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790733390", "079073172X", "6300216500", "0792836510", "6300269043", "0790751216", "0792837312", "6302890721", "079284100X", "6302054982", "6304429711", "0784011923", "6302610702", "6302360978", "6300182452", "0792110188", "6300263673", "B000005PF5", "0792835077", "B0000068SI", "6303020089", "630442972X", "6300214826", "6300183211", "B000003KDG", "6301976061", "B00000J2KZ", "630118663X", "0790734079", "6303212263", "6300214060", "6301327845", "0783222955", "6300271331", "B00000K2SC", "0792842464", "B000005PJ6", "6304437315", "0792133153", "6301802330", "6304025831", "6300181405", "6302787564", "0790735423", "6303029027", "0792108868", "0790751267", "6304509154", "0790705141", "B000007OY0", "6300269639", "0800100832", "6303686796", "630281622X", "6304258984", "079284517X", "0792839234", "6303920098", "0792110285", "6305622825", "6302712009", "0790733927", "6301586026", "0800125762", "6302596092", "630018224X", "0790748169", "0792839846", "6301971809", "6303506291", "6305576173", "0783223218", "6300214540", "0783241542", "6303313345"], "bought_together": ["0790733390"], "also_viewed": ["079073172X", "B005GJTZZG", "0790737744", "0790751267", "0792836510", "630118663X", "0790733390"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 365837}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.94, "brand": "", "asin": "0790731975", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VY4VS01BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dirty Harry [VHS]"}
{"description": "A gripping true crime yarn, a juicy slice of overheated New York atmosphere, and a splendid showcase for its young actors,Dog Day Afternoonis a minor classic of the 1970s. The opening montage of New York street life (set to Elton John's lazy &quot;Amoreena&quot;) establishes the oppressive mood of a scorching afternoon in the city with such immediacy that you can almost smell the garbage baking in the sun and the water from the hydrants evaporating from the sizzling pavement. Al Pacino plays Sonny, who, along with his rather slow-witted accomplice Sal (John Cazale, familiar as Pacino'sGodfatherbrother Fredo), holds hostages after a botched a bank robbery. Sonny finds himself transformed into a rebel celebrity when his standoff with police (including lead negotiator Charles Durning) is covered live on local television. The movie doesn't appear to be about anything in particular, but it really conveys the feel of wild and unpredictable events unfolding before your eyes, and the whole picture is so convincing and involving that you're glued to the screen. An Oscar winner for original screenplay,Dog Day Afternoonwas also nominated for best picture, actor, supporting actor (Chris Sarandon, as a surprise figure from Sonny's past), editing, and director (Sidney Lumet ofSerpico,Prince of the City,The Verdict, andRunning on Empty).--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["630018627X", "6300216543", "B000003KHS", "6300183211", "630021639X", "0790705141", "6300267881", "6304457375", "0764006770", "0783229585", "6301208773", "B000AMW2TK", "0792845684", "B00000J2KZ", "0792839846", "6301888901", "0790731975", "0783216084", "6301971809", "6303020089", "0800116917", "6303379214", "6301971582", "0792835077", "6300216500", "B00003CXZ3", "B000006ORX", "6304259131", "0792133153", "0783223218", "0790748169", "B00003G1FZ", "6303313345", "6303696813", "B000007PI9"], "bought_together": ["630018627X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 460635}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790733927", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YH9ME7MFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dog Day Afternoon [VHS]"}
{"description": "A favorite film of some of the world's greatest filmmakers, including Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg, John Ford'sThe Searchershas earned its place in the legacy of great American films for a variety of reasons. Perhaps most notably, it's the definitive role for John Wayne as an icon of the classic Western--the hero (or antihero) who must stand alone according to the unwritten code of the West. The story takes place in Texas in 1868; Wayne plays Ethan Edwards, a Confederate veteran who visits his brother and sister-in-law at their ranch and is horrified when they are killed by marauding Comanches. Ethan's search for a surviving niece (played by young Natalie Wood) becomes an all-consuming obsession. With the help of a family friend (Jeffrey Hunter) who is himself part Cherokee, Ethan hits the trail on a five-year quest for revenge. At the peak of his masterful talent, director Ford crafts this classic tale as an embittered examination of racism and blind hatred, provoking Wayne to give one of the best performances of his career. As with many of Ford's classic Westerns,The Searchersmust contend with revisionism in its stereotypical treatment of \"savage\" Native Americans, and the film's visual beauty (the final shot is one of the great images in all of Western culture) is compromised by some uneven performances and stilted dialogue. Still, this is undeniably one of the greatest Westerns ever made.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300268470", "630197705X", "0792106989", "6301325508", "0782008348", "6303057225", "6300181588", "6300268799", "0792102320", "6301797922", "6301802330", "6303192254", "0792838556", "6301805518", "6304071876", "6301798759", "6300184951", "6300269884", "6300267830", "1555265952", "6300181715", "0792107128", "6303599052", "6300208281", "0783221347", "B00004RFFA", "6304457308", "6304457278", "079284517X", "6301977165", "6300268748", "B000051S3Z", "B001E419N8", "B000M7BEPQ", "B000GX4476", "0792110188", "6301628454", "6300988473", "0800132009", "B000059HGY", "6301805615", "B00004WZR1", "6301670159", "0792107683", "630310374X", "0783235607", "6303942830", "6302884438", "6305237115", "630150528X", "0792834879", "0790743213", "0783235593", "6304259131", "6301798503", "630018224X", "6302130379", "B000006N70", "6304935811"], "also_viewed": ["6303599052", "6303168507", "6300269884", "6301802330", "0792106989"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 293111}, "asin": "0790736918", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G79RSPRAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Searchers [VHS]"}
{"description": "The last film completed by Bruce Lee before his untimely death,Enter the Dragonwas his entr&eacute;e into Hollywood. The American-Hong Kong coproduction, shot in Asia by American director Robert Clouse, stars Lee as a British agent sent to infiltrate the criminal empire of bloodthirsty Asian crime lord Han (Shih Kien) through his annual international martial arts tournament. Lee spends his days taking on tournament combatants and nights breaking into the heavily guarded underground fortress, kicking the living tar out of anyone who stands in his way. The mix of kung fu fighting (choreographed by Lee himself) and James Bond intrigue (the plot has more than a passing resemblance toDr. No) is pulpy by any standard, but the generous budget and talented cast of world-class martial artists puts this film in a category well above Lee's earlier Hong Kong productions. Unfortunately he's off the screen for large chunks of time as American maverick competitors (and champion martial artists) John Saxon and Jim Kelly take center stage, but once the fighting starts Lee takes over. The tournament setting provides an ample display of martial arts mastery of many styles and climaxes with a huge free-for-all, but the highlight is Lee's brutal one-on-one with the claw-fisted Han in the dynamic hall-of-mirrors battle. Lee narrows his eyes and tenses into a wiry force of sinew, speed, and ruthless determination.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300250164", "6301163796", "6300250172", "6305508534", "6300250156"], "bought_together": ["6300250164", "6300250172"], "also_viewed": ["6300250164", "6305519471", "6300250172"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 109259}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790735172", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X0KFFZYFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Enter the Dragon [VHS]"}
{"description": "In a time when it seems that every other movie makes some claim to being a film noir,L.A. Confidentialis the real thing--a gritty, sordid tale of sex, scandal, betrayal, and corruption of all sorts (police, political, press--and, of course, very personal) in 1940s Hollywood. The Oscar-winning screenplay is actually based on several titles in James Ellroy's series of chronological thriller novels (including the title volume,The Big Nowhere, andWhite Jazz)--a compelling blend of L.A. history and pulp fiction that has earned it comparisons to the greatest of all Technicolor noir films,Chinatown. Kim Basinger richly deserved her Supporting Actress Oscar for her portrayal of a conflicted femme fatale; unfortunately, her male costars are so uniformly fine that they may have canceled each other out with the Academy voters: Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kevin Spacey, and James Cromwell play LAPD officers of varying stripes. Pearce's character is a particularly intriguing study in Hollywood amorality and ambition, a strait-laced &quot;hero&quot; (and son of a departmental legend) whose career goals outweigh all other moral, ethical, and legal considerations.

The promised money is good but the clients are creeps: gun-toting art dealers who ultimately set up Harry for a murder, forcing him to go on the run across Europe with an art expert (Irene Jacob) in tow.

Worrying about this guy's fate is not an inviting prospect, but there are compensations in Jacob's smart performance and Rod Steiger's emotionally raw presence as Harry's mentor father. Director John Badham takes particular delight in penetrating the arcane world of forgery and in detailing Harry's working methods, from intense research to color selections to choices of tools and aging processes. Badham keeps us constantly curious and fascinated by this unholy marriage of expertise and deceit, and at least nominally interested in Harry's efforts to free himself of the criminal squandering of his talents.--Tom Keogh", "price": 0.5, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 457154}, "asin": "0790737329", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41RTPF8JF7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Incognito [VHS]"}

{"description": "Fifteen years after John Carpenter squandered a great idea on a mediocre movie (Escape from New York), he does it again--this time on the Left Coast. Kurt Russell is back as the terminally cynical one-eyed action hero Snake Plissken who, this time, has been coerced into saving the world in Los Angeles. It's 2013 and L.A. is now an island maximum security prison off the coast of California. Snake has 10 hours to find a doomsday weapon that's fallen into the hands of revolutionaries before he dies of a virus with which he's been injected. But the action is clumsy and unimaginative: lots of shootouts and very little suspense. Even the bad guys aren't particularly inventive; only Pam Grier, as a transsexual gang leader, strikes any sparks.

{"description": "When the theatrical release of James Cameron'sTitanicwas delayed from July to December of 1997, media pundits speculated that Cameron's $200&nbsp;million disaster epic would cause the director's downfall, signal the end of the blockbuster era, and sink Paramount Studios as quickly as the ill-fated luxury liner had sunk on that fateful night of April&nbsp;14, 1912. Some studio executives were confident, others horrified, but the clarity of hindsight turned Cameron into an Oscar-winning genius, a shrewd businessman, and one of the most successful directors in the history of motion pictures.Titanicwould surpass the $1&nbsp;billion mark in global box-office receipts (largely due to multiple viewings, the majority by teenage girls), win 11&nbsp;Academy Awards including best picture and director, produce the best-selling movie soundtrack of all time, and make a global superstar of Leonardo DiCaprio. A bona fide pop-cultural phenomenon, the film has all the ingredients of a blockbuster (romance, passion, luxury, grand scale, a snidely villain, and an epic, life-threatening crisis), but Cameron's alchemy of these ingredients proved more popular than anyone could have predicted. His stroke of genius was to combine absolute authenticity with a pair of fictional lovers whose tragic fate would draw viewers into the heart-wrenching reality of theTitanicdisaster. As starving artist Jack Dawson and soon-to-be-married socialite Rose DeWitt Bukater, DiCaprio and Kate Winslet won the hearts of viewers around the world, and their brief but never-forgotten love affair provides the humanity that Cameron needed to turnTitanicinto an emotional experience. Present-day framing scenes (featuring Gloria Stuart as the 101-year-old Rose) add additional resonance to the story, and although some viewers proved vehemently immune to Cameron's manipulations, few can deny the production's impressive achievements. Although some of the computer-generated visual effects look artificial, others--such as the sunset silhouette ofTitanicduring its first evening at sea, or the climactic splitting of the ship's sinking hull--are state-of-the-art marvels. In terms of sets and costumes alone, the film is never less than astounding. More than anything else, however, the film's overwhelming popularity speaks for itself.Titanicis an event film and a monument to Cameron's risk-taking audacity, blending the tragic irony of theTitanicdisaster with just enough narrative invention to give the historical event its fullest and most timeless dramatic impact.Titanicis an epic love story on par withGone with the Wind, and like that earlier box-office phenomenon, it's a film for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305123616", "6304117752", "6301792734", "6303215734", "B00000JS61", "6304178352", "6303396623", "6303314015", "B00003CXTF", "0769403468", "6301734734", "6302936381", "6303300480", "6305368139", "B00005RRG3", "6302610702", "0792839846", "6300207919", "B000P0J0C4", "6304546262", "B000056BRF", "6304400551", "6303101267", "630150528X", "6303637574", "B000P0J0EW", "6305126062", "6302935148", "0800199421", "6304681496", "0792116887", "6301963911", "B0000DCGT1", "B00001IVED", "6305169187", "B00006RCST", "6300216721", "630197879X", "0800113055", "076780922X", "080010367X", "0800141326", "0800184319", "6304039522", "B000066AXC"], "bought_together": ["6305123616"], "also_viewed": ["B009VQHDSQ", "6303314015", "B0074JODXU", "B00003CXTF", "B003JQZXWW", "6302787068", "6301796535", "0788812807", "0788806270", "B00005JKDQ", "6304500831", "6305229449", "6304117752", "6300213668", "6304089767", "B0000AQZYM", "079213690X", "6303049079", "6305123616", "6303402348", "6301792734", "0788812408", "B00079HZSE", "B000035Z2S", "B00000K3AN", "0788805843", "6302526574", "B0000029YC", "6303534422", "6303215734", "B0070285YE", "B00008LDO9", "0783216084", "6304434340", "B00BBND56G", "0788805533", "6300183211", "6302320402", "6305750750", "B0002CHI3S", "0790748266", "6304143184", "B0000040CM", "B005X7H9SQ", "B00004RFHF", "B00005V1Z7", "6302814782", "6301572688", "B00000JS61", "B008SLUWZG", "6303257844", "B00078XGO2", "0790736039", "B0000040EJ", "B000065U6Q", "B00003CX7L", "B00000ADKZ", "6300263673", "6302178924"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 65950}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.47, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "0792151712", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21BAWEVBJ1L.jpg", "title": "Titanic [VHS]"}
{"description": "The only remaining evidence that Sylvester Stallone might have had a respectable career, this 1976 Oscar winner (for Best Picture, Director, and Editing) is still the quintessential ode to an underdog and one of the best boxing movies ever made. After writing the script about a two-bit boxer who gets a &quot;million-to-one shot&quot; against the world heavyweight champion, Stallone insisted that he star in the title role, and his equally unknown status helped to catapult him (and this rousing film) to overnight success. The story is familiar, but it has been handled with such vitality and emotional honesty that you can't help but leap and cheer for Rocky Balboa, the chump turned champ (despite his valiant defeat in the ring) who stuns the boxing world with the support of his timid girlfriend, Adrian (Talia Shire), and grizzled trainer, Gus (Burgess Meredith). Oscar nominations went to all the lead actors (including Burt Young as Adrian's hot-tempered brother), but four sequels could never top the universal appeal of this low-budget crowd pleaser.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006GAOG8", "B0006GAO6I", "B0006GAOGI", "B000N4SHPS", "B0006GAOGS", "B007STBUHI", "B00005MEOU", "B000ICM5O4", "B00AEFY0F2", "6304907729", "B00004W221", "B000IJ79UW", "B00000HZY2", "B007N31YH0", "B00004XPPC", "B004FQX5A2", "B0014Z4OMU", "B00003CXBU", "B0008JIJ2E", "B000XJD34I", "B007SPPANM", "B000ARTN3I", "B0001US8F8", "B000KX0IOA", "B003ASLJQI", "0792843592", "0780021312", "B00079Z9VO", "B00J2AU8MY", "B001LXIDVI", "B0068FZ0GK", "B00AEBB9FA", "B000BYA4HE", "B000EHRVOW", "B00006ADD5", "B0010AN7Z4", "B00066FBQG", "B000BITV92", "B0087ZG7HK", "B000IJ79WU", "B000059H9A", "B000ZM1MG4", "B0002WZTOI", "B0001US66Y", "B0049985XW", "B001GZ6QC4", "B000VECAD0", "B006FE83UE", "0792838041", "0800177258", "B004SIP7F8", "B00005JKCH", "B00AEFY6DI", "B00008K76U", "B00AEBB9F0", "B001AEF6BS", "B00004BZIY", "B004QBWU02", "B0060ZJ7BC", "B00011D1OK", "B00004TVUD", "B000HE2ZUW"], "bought_together": ["B0006GAOG8", "B0006GAO6I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000WC3A0S", "B004FQX5C0", "B00J4BW10S", "B000N4SHPS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 405226}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.85, "brand": "", "asin": "079283321X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AP5MY2B5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rocky (1976)"}
{"description": "Maybe \"nobody's perfect,\" as one character in this masterpiece suggests. But some movies are perfect, andSome Like It Hotis one of them. In Chicago, during the Prohibition era, two skirt-chasing musicians, Joe and Jerry (Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon), inadvertently witness the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. In order to escape the wrath of gangland chief Spats Colombo (George Raft), the boys, in drag, join an all-woman band headed for Florida. They vie for the attention of the lead singer, Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe), a much-disappointed songbird who warbles \"I'm Through with Love\" but remains vulnerable to yet another unreliable saxophone player. (When Curtis courts her without his dress, he adopts the voice of Cary Grant--a spot-on impersonation.) The script by director Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond is beautifully measured; everything works, like a flawless clock. Aspiring screenwriters would be well advised to throw away the how-to books and simply study this film. The bulk of the slapstick is handled by an unhinged Lemmon and the razor-sharp Joe E. Brown, who plays a horny retiree smitten by Jerry's feminine charms.

{"description": "Truly ridiculous but somehow moving, this right-wing paranoid fantasy by John Milius (The Wind and the Lion) from 1984 concerns a Soviet takeover of the United States and a band of ragtag adolescents who metamorphose into freedom fighters. One can laugh at the notion of Nicaraguans, Cubans, and Russians having worked out a master plan to invade America, but Milius's account of how such a grim day affects a small Western town really does get under one's skin. The cast--most of whom were not yet stars (Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey had probably never heard of a script calledDirty Dancingat the time)--are quite persuasive as nice kids who come to recognize the tragedy of their lost innocence through fierce, uncompromising struggle. Powers Boothe is very good as a pilot who briefly comes to their aid, and Harry Dean Stanton is stirring as a solid working man and father who represents the virtues his sons are fighting for.

{"description": "Ah, those fun-loving Communists! InNinotchkathree Soviets make their way to Paris to sell off imperial jewels to raise money to buy tractors for the USSR. When Grand Duchess Swana (Ina Claire), former owner of the jewels, discovers what's happening, she deploys her lover Leon (Melvyn Douglas) to recover her gems. He starts a court proceeding while seducing the three bumbling Soviets with the luxuries of capitalistic life. The delay of the sale is noticed in Moscow, and Comrade Ninotchka (Greta Garbo) is dispatched to Paris to settle the matter. Soon after arrival, she meets Leon, who is charmed by her severe, uptight manner and her stunning beauty (\"I love Russians! Comrade, I've been fascinated by your five-year plan for the last 15 years\"), and he sets about wooing her, despite her disbelief in love (it's merely a \"chemical reaction,\" she dourly informs him). Romance, jealousy, and capitalistic frivolity ensue.When this film was released in 1939, it was advertised as \"Garbo laughs,\" as it was her first and only comedy. The film, directed by Ernst Lubitsch, is amusing not only for its story line, but also for its dated look at early Communism (Ninotchka keeps a photo of a stern-looking Lenin by her bedside, although she feels uncomfortable doing so in a room that costs 2,000 francs a night, the price of a cow back home). The satirical image of the young Communist fighting against corrupt Western ways seems somewhat idealistic today but nonetheless provided levity during the shaky political times of the film's release. Viewers may be jarred by the casual \"Heil Hitler\" greeting of a couple at the train station, but overall this film holds up as one of Lubitsch's masterpieces and a lighter glimpse of the mysterious Garbo.--Jenny Brown", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000K0YLZ0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 493885}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.09, "brand": "", "asin": "0792840062", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NRVK2PQTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ninotchka [VHS]"}

This time the Man with No Name (Clint Eastwood) is a bounty hunter whose desert Southwest killing ground is suddenly crowded by the presence of an older, black-clad shootist (Lee Van Cleef). Individually and together, they terminate sundry grotesques while closing in on their biggest quarry, a memorably insane bandit called El Indio (Gian Maria Volont&eacute; is brilliant).

{"description": "FutureNightmarecreator andScreamweaver Wes Craven's  film debut is a primitive little production that rises above its cut-rate  production values and hazy, grainy patina via its grimly affecting portrait  of human evil infiltrating a middle-class household. The story is adapted  from Ingmar Bergman'sThe Virgin Spring, but the film has more in  common with Sam Peckinpah'sStraw Dogsas it charts the descent of a  harmless married couple into methodical killers. A quartet of criminals--a  distorted version of the nuclear family--kidnaps a pair of teenage girls and  proceeds to ravage, rape, torture, and finally brutally murder them in the  woods, unwittingly within walking distance of their rural home. The killers  take refuge in the girls' own home, but when the parents discover just who  they are and what they've done, they plot violent retribution.Along with George Romero'sNight of the Living Deadand Tobe Hooper'sTexas Chainsaw Massacre, Craven helped redefine American horror with  this debut--all three movies portray modern society crumbling into madness  and horror. But, unlike his fellow directors, Craven gives his film an  uncomfortable verisimilitude, setting it squarely in the heartland of modern  America. While at times it's awkward and inconsistent, with distracting comic  interludes, his handling of the brutal horror scenes is unsettling, and the  death of the daughter is an unexpectedly quiet and lyrical moment.--Sean  Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792839242", "6302921058", "B00000K0DU", "6300214311", "6300182770", "B00000IQUT"], "also_viewed": ["6302921058"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 475308}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.78, "brand": "", "asin": "079284632X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512ZWA7XGZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Last House on the Left [VHS]"}

{"description": "Horror master John Carpenter offers up a triple treat withThe  Fog: Jamie Lee Curtis, Adrienne Barbeau, and Janet Leigh all in the same  movie. As if that weren't enough, both John Houseman and Hal Holbrook make  appearances, each clearly enjoying the novelty of being in a horror flick.The Fogopens just before the centennial celebration of the seaside  town of Antonio Bay. Then the witching hour strikes, glowing fog rolls in,  and all hell breaks loose. Carpenter wrote the script with producer Debra  Hill, his collaborator onHalloween, and the two know their craft.  It's a creepy story and a tight script, and, as in their previous effort, the  audience gets to know the main characters a bit before they're put in danger.  The movie also has a sly sense of humor: \"Things seem to happen to me,\" says  slasher vet Jamie Lee. \"I'm bad luck.\" Barbeau is also obviously having a  great time, sinking her teeth into her role as a frightened disc jockey  watching the fog roll in from a lighthouse.The Fogoffers a few  shocks and plenty of good old-fashioned clammy chills.

{"description": "Of all the many documentaries that have been made about theTitanicdisaster, this two-part, 192-minute film, produced in 1994 for the Arts &amp; Entertainment network, remains the most thorough, authoritative, and fascinating chronicle of theTitanictragedy. Written, produced, and directed by Melissa Jo Peltier and elegantly narrated by actor David McCallum, the film utilizes thorough research, archival films and documents, and expert testimony to span the entire history of the legendary S.S.Titanic. From blueprint design and construction in Ireland, to the ill-fated maiden voyage and the lasting legacy ofTitanic's fateful sinking, no detail has been neglected in the film's meticulous description of events. Part 1, \"The Death of a Dream,\" builds dramatic momentum to the ship's collision with an iceberg in the freezing North Atlantic, including detailed accounts of the agonizing two-hour sinking and the rescue of survivors. Part 2, \"The Legend Lives On,\" explores the investigation intoTitanic's sinking, the impact on later ship design and the dramatic rediscovery ofTitanic's ghostly remains on the ocean floor. Parts 1 and 2 include abundant interviews with such notedTitanicauthorities as Don Lynch and Ken Marschall (consultants on the blockbuster movieTitanic), and severalTitanicsurvivors who have since passed away. The cumulative effect of this detailed film is a complete appreciation for the sheer irony, drama, and magnitude of theTitanicdisaster. The James Cameron film was certainly entertaining, but this superior documentary proves that truth can be every bit as absorbing as fictionalized history. It's an essential addition to anyTitanicbuff's library.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008LDO9", "B007SPPANM", "6303396623"], "also_viewed": ["B006ENHG8Q", "B00079HZSE", "0792151712"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 136278}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.9, "brand": "A&amp;E", "asin": "156501345X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518XM7PWYGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Titanic (A&amp;E Documentary) [VHS]"}
{"description": "Robert Bresson drew inspiration from Dostoevsky'sCrime and Punishmentfor this examination of an arrogant young pickpocket who deems himself above the laws and conditions of ordinary men. Michel (Martin LaSalle), a rather bland-looking young man with a perpetually blank face, haunts the subways, city streets, and racetracks to ply his trade. He plays a game of wits with a fatherly police inspector and walls his heart off from the affections of a quiet young woman, Jeanne (Marika Green), who looks after his dying mother. Bresson's direction of his \"models\" (as he calls his nonprofessional performers) strips them of affectation and motivation, making them blank slates defined by the accumulation of precisely drilled actions and words.Pickpocketis no thriller, though Bresson offers impressive, meticulously detailed scenes of daring and intimate robberies (one sequence on a subway feels like an homage to Sam Fuller'sPickup on South Street). Rather, it is a powerful, profound search for meaning and spiritual enlightenment by a man who believes in nothing but himself, and many critics consider it Bresson's masterpiece. Paul Schrader, whose bookTranscendental Cinemaoffers a detailed analysis of Bresson's work, has quoted the famous, emotionally restrained yet spiritually moving conclusion in two of his own films:American GigoloandLight Sleeper.--Sean Axmaker", "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 597369}, "asin": "1567301290", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21WTVB3RD3L.jpg", "title": "Pickpocket [VHS]"}

{"description": "A darling of the 1998 festival circuit, Marc Levin'sSlamwon the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance as well as the Camera d'Or (best first film) at Cannes. Despite its shortcomings, the film merits these awards--Slamoffers a strong cast and compelling subject matter, a perfect setting with a killersoundtrack, and over-the-top rap poetry.The film opens with an exterior shot of the protagonist, Raymond Joshua (played by real-life poet Saul Williams), walking away from the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. The image of a young black man turning his back on this symbol of government scant minutes before he's popped on a chump-change drug charge is poignant and disturbing--not easily forgotten by anyone aware of the immense contradictions inherent in the demographics of the nation's capital.Slamdepicts Raymond's fall from relative innocence, and his apparent redemption. As a small-time dope dealer and street poet, his arrest thrusts him into an unfamiliar world--the violence of life in the slammer is palpable and altogether frightening. Incarceration, however, awakens the slumbering power of Raymond's poetry; eventually, its strength keeps him alive. In a prison yard scene when he's about to get whomped, Raymond gives free rein to his words, choosing poetry in motion over violence. Hearing Raymond's impassioned words, the hardened cons let him walk. One of them even covers his bail, and Raymond hits the streets, eager to check out Lauren (Sonja Sohn), the creative-writing teacher he met behind bars.Although the third act dilutes the credibility established by Levin's in-your-face v&eacute;rit&eacute; style,Slamis relentlessly passionate, unswerving in its conviction that there's an alternative to the violence that decimates North America's inner cities. Indeed, for all the film's preachiness, we cheer Raymond on, fueling his poetry, hoping, somehow, that it can transform those around him.

{"description": "Like the Greenwich Village courtyard view from its titular portal, Alfred Hitchcock's classicRear Windowis both confined and multileveled: both its story and visual perspective are dictated by its protagonist's imprisonment in his apartment, convalescing in a wheelchair, from which both he and the audience observe the lives of his neighbors. Cheerful voyeurism, as well as the behavior glimpsed among the various tenants, affords a droll comic atmosphere that gradually darkens when he sees clues to what may be a murder.Photographer L.B. \"Jeff\" Jeffries (James Stewart) is, in fact, a voyeur by trade, a professional photographer sidelined by an accident while on assignment. His immersion in the human drama (and comedy) visible from his window is a by-product of boredom, underlined by the disapproval of his girlfriend, Lisa (Grace Kelly), and a wisecracking visiting nurse (Thelma Ritter). Yet when the invalid wife of Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr) disappears, Jeff enlists the two women to help him to determine whether she's really left town, as Thorwald insists, or been murdered.Hitchcock scholar Donald Spoto convincingly argues that the crime at the center of this mystery is the MacGuffin--a mere pretext--in a film that's more interested in the implications of Jeff's sentinel perspective. We actually learn more about the lives of the other neighbors (given generic names by Jeff, even as he's drawn into their lives) he, and we, watch undetected than we do the putative murderer and his victim. Jeff's evident fear of intimacy and commitment with the elegant, adoring Lisa provides the other vital thread to the script, one woven not only into the couple's own relationship, but reflected and even commented upon through the various neighbors' lives.At minimum, Hitchcock's skill at making us accomplices to Jeff's spying, coupled with an ingenious escalation of suspense as the teasingly vague evidence coalesces into ominous proof, deliver a superb thriller spiked with droll humor, right up to its nail-biting, nightmarish climax. At deeper levels, however,Rear Windowplumbs issues of moral responsibility and emotional honesty, while offering further proof (were any needed) of the director's brilliance as a visual storyteller.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790743213", "0783221347", "6304039530", "6300181340", "0783235593", "6300183580", "6300215741", "6301798503", "0783235607", "6305123616", "0792839846", "0783222955", "B0002IXSVI", "630150528X", "6301647734", "6304429274", "B0000040EO", "6302797667", "1558807780", "0783235704", "0792837614", "0783236352", "0783235623", "6301734734", "0790743159", "6305576173", "6304359705", "0783235682", "B00005A06N", "6304119097", "630266232X", "6301964012", "6300181529", "630233683X", "6301670159", "B00000F13T", "6301977084", "6301976061", "0792837649", "6303494390", "0782008348", "6300215512", "6305282927", "B00001OWYM", "B00005N5S2", "6303215734", "6300215717", "B000005PPB", "0783235674", "6305012792", "6304196954", "0800132009", "6302241103", "0792841859", "6304071876", "6302909023", "B00AEFXD1O", "B00000F3QZ", "6301607929", "6301978110", "B0087ZG7PW", "6300267865", "0800113055", "B000006N70", "B0045HCJ9E", "0782006809", "B00007JME0", "0780614097", "6301670140", "0792110269", "B000021Y6M", "6300269477", "0783235615", "6302413435", "6301798740", "0792837096", "6303854311", "B00005Q4GY", "0792107683", "0792837630", "6302800897", "6304457316", "0792835573", "6301978552", "B00000JKNL", "6303637574", "6305222754", "6302360978", "B00000JZIH", "6301797957", "6301975987", "1558800034", "6304359675", "6300271781", "630197350X", "6303364772", "6300216365", "6301800974", "0783227264"], "bought_together": ["0783221347", "6300183580"], "also_viewed": ["B0087ZG7PW", "B0045HCJ9E", "B0002HOEQ2", "B002GSXKQA", "B000A1INJE", "B000055Y0X", "B0087ZG7UW", "B001D8W7EU", "B00KMAVPW0", "B00J2R3VZI", "B008D1Q1VU", "B0045HCJHG", "B006FE83UE", "B00AEBB89C", "B003LMPKSQ", "B0045HCJQW", "B007N5YJWK", "0792839846", "B0002HOERG", "0790743213", "B000CCW2TS", "B000LP6KNU", "B000ECX0S8", "6304119046", "B00004XPPC", "B0010YSD7W", "B00AEBB97S", "B001D8W7EK", "B000ECX0O2", "6304429274", "B00I3C1T34", "6304039530", "630266232X", "0800132009", "6304039522", "B003VS0CX8", "0783235593", "B002VWNIAY", "6300183211", "B00BWJQEC6", "B0087F7VSY", "B002VWNIDG", "B00CNW9ZI6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 203666}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.18, "brand": "", "asin": "6300183513", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518BC0WC70L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rear Window [VHS]"}

{"description": "You could only see his eyes behind the layers of makeup, but those expressive orbs earned John Hurt a well-deserved Oscar nomination for his moving portrayal of John Merrick, the grotesquely deformed Victorian-era man better known as The Elephant Man. Inarticulate and abused, Merrick is the virtual slave of a carnival barker (Freddie Jones) until dedicated London doctor Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins in a powerfully understated performance) rescues him from the life and offers him an existence with dignity. Anne Bancroft costars as the actress whose visit to Merrick makes him a social curiosity, with John Gielgud and Wendy Hiller as dubious hospital staffers won over by Merrick. David Lynch earned his only Oscar nominations as director and cowriter of this somber drama, which he shot in a rich black-and-white palette, a sometimes stark, sometimes dreamy visual style that at times recalls the offbeat expressionism of his first film,Eraserhead. It remains a perfect marriage between traditional Hollywood historical drama and Lynch's unique cinematic eye, a compassionate human tale delivered in a gothic vein.

{"description": "This splatter flick, along with John Carpenter'sHalloween, helped spawn the great horror-movie movement of the '80s, not to mentioneightsequels, many of which had nothing to do with the films that preceded them. It also gave birth to Jason Voorhees, one of the three biggest horror-movie psychos of the modern era (the other two beingHalloween's Michael Myers andA Nightmare on Elm Street's Freddy Krueger). Forever duplicated, the originalFriday the 13thpopularized a number of themes and techniques that today are now clich&eacute;s: the increasingly gory murders, the remote forest location, the anonymous and nubile cast, the murderer as cult hero, and, of course, the moral that if you have sex, you will die, very painfully. Still, if you have to see aFriday the 13thmovie, this is the one to check out. A group of eager (and horny) teenagers decide to reopen Camp Crystal Lake, which 20 years earlier was closed after the shocking and mysterious murders of two amorous camp counselors. You can take it from there, as the teens get picked off one by one, during a dark and stormy night; of course, their car won't start and there's no phone. The ending stole shamelessly from Brian De Palma'sCarrie, but it still provides a slight if campy shock. Look for a young Kevin Bacon as the requisite stud--you can tell that's what he is because when the cast appears in swimsuits, he's wearing a Speedo--who's the beneficiary of the film's best murder sequence, an arrowhead to the throat.

{"description": "Maybe it doesn't quite live up to its sterling reputation, and maybe the leading man and director were slightly miscast. But who cares?Roman Holidayis the film that brought Audrey Hepburn to prominence, and the world movie audience went weak at the knees. The endlessly charming Hepburn had her first starring role in this sweet romance, playing a European princess on an official tour through Rome. Frustrated by her lack of connection to the real world, she slips away from her protective handlers and goes on a spree, aided by a tough-guy news reporter (Gregory Peck). Director William Wyler, more at home with such heavy-going, Oscar-winning classics asThe Best Years of Our LivesandBen- Hur, doesn't always keep the champagne bubbles afloat, and the Peck role would have fit Cary Grant like a silk glove. But the film is great fun, the location shooting is irresistible, and Hepburn embodies an image of chic style that would rule for the rest of the fifties.

Having discovered that his presumed-dead mother (Oscar&reg;winner Jo Van Fleet) is a brothel owner in nearby Salinas, Cal convinces her to finance an investment that will restore his father's lost fortune, but neither money nor the tenderness of his brother's fianc&eacute;e (Julie Harris) can assuage Cal's anguished need for paternal acceptance that comes nearly too late.

Written and directed by James L. Brooks, this shows remarkable insight into the people who make television. On the surface it is about that love triangle. If you look a little deeper, however, you will see that this behind-the-scenes comedy is a very revealing look at obsessive behavior and the heightened emotions that accompany adrenaline addiction.

{"description": "This adaptation of the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel, scripted by Francis Ford Coppola, puts costume design and art direction above the intricacies of character. It's certainly a handsome try, and perhaps no movie could captureThe Great Gatsbyin its entirety. Robert Redford is an interesting casting choice as Gatsby, the millionaire isolated in his mansion, still dreaming of the woman he lost. And Sam Waterston is perfect as the narrator, Nick, who brings the dream girl Daisy Buchanan back to Gatsby. No, the problem seems to be that director Jack Clayton fell in love with the flapper dresses and the party scenes and the Jazz Age tunes, ending up with a Classics Illustrated version of a great book rather than a fresh, organic take on the text. While Redford grows more quietly intriguing in the film, Mia Farrow's pallid performance as Daisy leaves you wondering why Gatsby, or anyone else, should care so much about his grand passion. The effective supporting cast includes Bruce Dern as Daisy's husband, and Scott Wilson and Karen Black as the low-rent couple whose destinies cross the sun-drenched protagonists. (That's future star Patsy Kensit as Daisy's little daughter.) The film won two Oscars--not surprisingly, for costumes and musical score.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["0800125762", "6302816629", "6300182215", "6305718792", "6300215814", "B0001E7LQG", "6304925158", "6302415853", "6302281415", "6300216500", "6300262782", "6303052223", "0790744759", "0800124693", "0792839846", "6304039522", "0800106032", "6302936381", "6303823351", "630382336X", "0792110803"], "bought_together": ["0743273567"], "also_viewed": ["B00DHHWXYY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 232595}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.65, "brand": "", "asin": "6301247485", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XW0FSNT7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Great Gatsby [VHS]"}
{"description": "Seven years after he earned his first screen credit as the writer ofFast Times at Ridgemont High, formerRolling Stonewriter Cameron Crowe made his directorial debut with this acclaimed romantic comedy starring John Cusack and Ione Skye as unlikely lovers on the cusp of adulthood. The casting is perfect, and Crowe's rookie direction is appropriately unobtrusive, no doubt influenced by his actor-loving, Oscar&reg;-winning mentor, James L. Brooks. But the real strength of Crowe's work is his exceptional writing, his timely grasp of contemporary rhythms and language (he's frequently called \"the voice of a generation\"), and the rich humor and depth of his fully developed characters. InSay Anything...Cusack and Skye play recent high school graduates enjoying one final summer before leaping into a lifetime of adult responsibilities. Lloyd (Cusack) is an aspiring kickboxer with no definite plans; Diane (Skye) is a valedictorian with intentions to further her education in Europe. Together they find unlikely bliss, but there's also turbulence when Diane's father (John Mahoney)--who only wants what's best for his daughter--is charged with fraud and tax evasion. Favoring strong performances over obtrusive visual style, Crowe focuses on his unique characters and the ambitions and fears that define them; the movie's a treasure trove of quiet, often humorous revelations of personality. Lili Taylor and Eric Stoltz score high marks for memorable supporting roles, and Cusack's own sister Joan is perfect in scenes with her onscreen and offscreen brother. A rare romantic comedy that's as funny as it is dramatically honest,Say Anything...marked the arrival of a gifted writer-director who followed up with the underratedSinglesbefore scoring his first box-office smash withJerry Maguire.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300147940", "630018403X", "B000051S41", "6300183467", "6300263673", "6300214370", "0792837207", "6300184269", "6300214753", "B000068MFS", "6300214710"], "bought_together": ["6300147940"], "also_viewed": ["0800109481", "6300213986", "6300214710", "B001AEF6BI", "6300183467", "0790740222", "0767825411", "6300270033"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 257141}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6301412761", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41V8JBQ2E7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Say Anything [VHS]"}

After a fabulously successful season on TV, the campy comic book adventure hit the big screen, complete with painful puns, outrageous supervillains, and fights punctuated with word balloons sporting such onomatopoeic syllables as \"Pow!,\" \"Thud!,\" and \"Blammo!\" Adam West's wooden Batman is the cowled vigilante alter ego of straight-arrow millionaire Bruce Wayne and Bruce Ward's Robin (a.k.a.

The criminals are, naturally, out to conquer the world, but with a little help from their unending supply of utility belt devices (bat shark repellent, anyone?), our dynamic duo thwarts their nefarious plans at every turn.

{"description": "Western Unionis nominally one of those epic celebrations of great pioneer achievements, and its official heroes are an Eastern-bred, Harvard-trained engineer named Blake (Robert Young) and a visionary named Creighton (Dean Jagger), who dreams of a transcontinental telegraph system to unite a divided nation in the first year of the Civil War. But the film really belongs to Randolph Scott's Vance Shaw, a reformed outlaw trying to make good as a member of the team stringing \"the singing wire\" across the plains. His past--which Creighton knows something of--keeps reaching out for him, so that the brightly colored fable of westward progress is almost eclipsed by the darker, personal drama of embattled character and divided loyalties.Although this theme faintly recalls director Fritz Lang's towering 1937 fable of injustice,You Only Live Once, we shouldn't make too much of the affinity.Western Unionwas merely a studio assignment, and Lang--a passionate explorer and student of the American West--mostly concentrated on serving up lashings of period detail and atmosphere and devising spectacular set pieces. The latter include a mini-g&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung of a forest fire, two strikingly composed encounters with Indians, and a climactic barbershop shootout that's studded with Lang \"touches.\" The scenery is magnificent (albeit a mite mountainous for Nebraska!), the Technicolor blazes as Technicolor should, and the costuming and art direction are so evocative that the German &eacute;migr&eacute; proudly received a commendation from an old timers' association praising the accuracy of his frontier re-creation.--Richard T.

{"description": "When Roman tribune Marcellus Gallio (Richard Burton) is sent to Jerusalem, one of his assignments is the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Marcellus, a cynical and hardened man, wins the robe Jesus wore to the crucifixion while gambling with other Roman soldiers underneath the dying savior. He later becomes convinced that his hallucinations and violent outbursts are the result of a curse received from the robe, which is now in the possession of his escaped slave, Demetrius (Victor Mature), somewhere in the Middle East. He sets out to find Demetrius in order to destroy the robe and the curse and finds faith instead, converting to Christianity. This was the first movie to be filmed in CinemaScope, and won Oscars in 1953 for costume design, art direction, and set decoration. The visual aspects of the film are stunning, and it may be worth viewing for that alone; however, the script and acting leave much to be desired, and you won't find inspiration in these areas if that's what interests you.

{"description": "Many early science fiction films are now, quite inadvertently (and in most cases undeservedly), objects of camp attention: we laugh at the silly makeup, tin-can special effects, and the naive \"high-tech\" dialogue.Planet of the Apesis no such film. Its intelligent script, frightening costuming, and savagely effective conclusion (which needs no big-budget special effects to augment its impact) remain both potent and relevant. When Colonel George Taylor (the fabulous Charlton Heston) crash lands his spacecraft on what seems to be an unfamiliar planet, he is captured and held prisoner by a dominant race of hyperrational, articulate apes. However, the ape community is riven with internal dissention, centered in no small part on its policy toward humans, who, on this planet, are treated as mindless animals. Befriended and ultimately assisted by the more liberal simians, Taylor escapes--only to find a more terrifying obstacle confronting his return home. Heavy-handed object lessons abound--the ubiquity of generational warfare, the inflexibility of dogma, the cruelty of prejudice--and the didactic fingerprints of Rod Serling are very much in evidence here. But director Franklin Schaffner has a dark, pop-apocalyptic sci-fi vision all his own, and time has not dulled the monumental emotional impact of the film's climactic payoff shot.

{"description": "An alternate title for this movie could easily beRV to Hell.  Two middle-class couples take their spankin'-new motor home on a trip to  Colorado. While camping out in Texas, the men see something they shouldn't--a  human sacrifice by Satanists who somehow manage not to notice their Safeway- sized vehicle until the last minute. The tourists flee from the devil  worshippers, getting the monstrous RV hung up in a stream, and so goes the  rest of the movie. The local sheriff is in league with the devil, and every  town they come to is full of pesky Satanists. The vacationers are nothing if  not resourceful, though; when a pair of determined Beelzebubbers cling to the  vehicle like barnacles, Peter Fonda pokes at them with an aluminum  vacuum-cleaner wand until they give up and fall off! Oddly, halfway through the  film, it turns from a fairly routine (if suspenseful) horror movie to a Ron  Howard-style car-chase film, with a half-dozen vehicles pursuing the motor  home. The vacationers continue to abuse the RV until large chunks of it begin  to fall off, fending off their enemies with a shotgun until the nasty  surprise ending. With a cast that includes Fonda, Warren Oates, Loretta Swit,  and Lara Parker, it's hard to go wrong (though the women's roles consist of  screaming ineffectually, making coffee, and cleaning the earth-toned  Winnebago).

{"description": "Garbo won two consecutive New York Film Critics Awards for best actress in this andCamille--an altogether more satisfying selection. At 95 minutes, this handsome David O. Selznick production for MGM hasn't a prayer of doing justice to the rich supporting cast of characters in Tolstoy's thick novel (notably Kitty, through no fault of the perky Maureen O'Sullivan). That was equally true of Clarence Brown's 1927 silent versionLove(1927), also starring Garbo, but it was both more passionate and more fluid; Brown's direction here gathers no momentum within scenes or in the film overall. Garbo's quiet \"Too late, too late,\" as she realizes early on what a tragedy her obsessive love affair must lead to, is exquisitely doomed; but Fredric March makes a tiresome, even petulant, Vronsky.

{"description": "The dark urban world ofThe Asphalt Jungleis one of the essential destinations in film noir, but be warned: despite tough guy Sterling Hayden's dreams of bucolic escape, there is no way out. John Huston directed this superbly calibrated crime classic, which displays his usual wry appreciation of fringies and down-and-outers. This time the task for Huston's eccentric ensemble is a jewel robbery, which--this being a Huston film--can't possibly work out as well as its plan. The cast includes Sam Jaffee, indelible as a criminal mastermind, and the pre-stardom Marilyn Monroe. Hayden plays the kind of mug he would revisit in Stanley Kubrick'sThe Killing, which is an informal homage to this film. And the film's look is definitive: both artful and gritty, it creates a noir landscape that traps its people just as surely as the tar pits trapped the dinosaurs.

She's also a great athletic competitor, except when her overbearing, worrywart fianc&eacute;, Collier Weld, is around. (As Weld, William Ching does an admirable job in a thankless role.) All Pat has to do is see Collier's face on the sidelines and her golf swing loses its power; her tennis game goes haywire. It takes crooked sports manager Mike Conovan (Spencer Tracy, of course) to recognize Pat's outstanding talent. He takes her on as his most important client and handles her with the same loving care that he gives to his favorite racehorse. Naturally, Pat and Mike's relationship is destined to overstep its professional boundaries. The mutual attraction grows from the moment they meet. Watching Pat walk away, Mike comments to his partner, \"Not much meat on her, but what's there is 'cherce'.\"The film carries a powerful feminist message, especially considering that it was made in the early 1950s: Pat is undone by Collier, who would rather have her stick to being \"the little woman\" and forget about succeeding. But with Mike in her corner, Pat can have a great career. Her union with him is a true partnership; everything is, as he says, \"Five-oh, five-oh.\" In the end, he's secure enough to be comfortable as \"the man behind the woman.\" The film features terrific comic performances by Aldo Ray as a bone-headed boxer, a young Charles Bronson (before he changed his name from Buchinski) as a small-time gangster, andOur Gang's Carl \"Alfalfa\" Switzer as a high-strung bus boy.--Laura Mirsky", "related": {"also_bought": ["630290899X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 486884}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.46, "brand": "", "asin": "6301973267", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VEAMXZPFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pat &amp; Mike [VHS]"}
{"description": "In the entire history of American movies,The Night of the Hunterstands out as the rarest and most exotic of specimens. It is, to say the least, a masterpiece--and not just because it was the only movie directed by flamboyant actor Charles Laughton or the only produced solo screenplay by the legendary critic James Agee (who also cowroteThe African Queen). The truth is, nobody has ever made anything approaching its phantasmagoric, overheated style in which German expressionism, religious hysteria, fairy-tale fantasy (of the Grimm-est variety), and stalker movie are brought together in a furious boil. Like a nightmarish premonition of stalker movies to come,Night of the Huntertells the suspenseful tale of a demented preacher (Robert Mitchum, in a performance that prefigures his memorable villain inCape Fear), who torments a boy and his little sister--even marries their mixed-up mother (Shelley Winters)--because he's certain the kids know where their late bank-robber father hid a stash of stolen money. So dramatic, primal, and unforgettable are its images--the preacher's shadow looming over the children in their bedroom, the magical boat ride down a river whose banks teem with fantastic wildlife, those tattoos of LOVE and HATE on the unholy man's knuckles, the golden locks of a drowned woman waving in the current along with the indigenous plant life in her watery grave--that they're still haunting audiences (and filmmakers) today.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["1558808590", "6301976126", "0784011451", "0792101448", "6304212151", "1558807780", "B000003NDA", "6301966430", "6301491920", "B00000F6MH", "6304366035", "6302226899", "0790743159", "6302413435", "6301586026", "0790741431", "6300208133", "6304429274", "0783217528", "6301797906", "6301798732", "0800100832", "B000GX7MMA", "B000054OW2", "6301977815", "B000056BRF", "B0000048YO", "B001E419N8", "630266232X", "6301978110", "6302968100", "6305237115", "6301564456", "0782008348", "0792115449", "6302353785", "6301964012", "630150528X"], "bought_together": ["1558808590"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 201324}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6301973232", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/717SP3TYNML._SY300_.gif", "title": "Night of the Hunter [VHS]"}
{"description": "Sidney Lumet's directorial debut remains a tense, atmospheric (though slightly manipulative and stagy) courtroom thriller, in which the viewer never sees a trial and the only action is verbal. As he does in his later corruption commentaries such asSerpicoorQ & A, Lumet focuses on the lonely one-man battles of a protagonist whose ethics alienate him from the rest of jaded society. As the film opens, the seemingly open-and-shut trial of a young Puerto Rican accused of murdering his father with a knife has just concluded and the 12-man jury retires to their microscopic, sweltering quarters to decide the verdict. When the votes are counted, 11 men rule guilty, while one--played by Henry Fonda, again typecast as another liberal, truth-seeking hero--doubts the obvious. Stressing the idea of \"reasonable doubt,\" Fonda slowly chips away at the jury, who represent a microcosm of white, male society--exposing the prejudices and preconceptions that directly influence the other jurors' snap judgments. The tight script by Reginald Rose (based on his own teleplay) presents each juror vividly using detailed soliloquies, all which are expertly performed by the film's flawless cast. Still, it's Lumet's claustrophobic direction--all sweaty close-ups and cramped compositions within a one-room setting--that really transforms this contrived story into an explosive and compelling nail-biter.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783222955", "6300181987", "6304071876", "6300183513", "6304039530", "6304119046", "0790731975", "6300987485", "6304429274", "1558807780", "6301977149", "6303282237", "6302413435", "B00000K3C7", "6302226899", "B000BWIZRW", "B000006GCU", "6304111231", "0790743531", "6304111363", "6302935148", "6304383169", "6300181529", "6301797957", "630347327X", "0800125762", "B00008FECE", "6303402348", "6303506291", "630522269X", "6305613516", "0783221347", "6304151306", "6301973305"], "also_viewed": ["B00004YRHZ", "B002VRNJTE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 259403}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.87, "brand": "", "asin": "6301976061", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5188HQ5P25L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "12 Angry Men [VHS]"}

{"description": "Juxtaposing images of pristine, romantic innocence with ones of mute, meaningless violence, Godard'sMasculin-F&#xE9;mininfirst lulls with a hypnotic, disjointed story line and then stuns with scenes of tremendous depth and meaning. This outrageous film follows the somewhat ineffectual courtship of Madeline, an aspiring pop singer, by Paul, an erstwhile journalist and interviewer but mostly groundless searcher. As in most Godard films, plot mechanics are secondary to elements such as dialog (generally marvelous, but sometimes a bit too pointed), lighting (bizarre and oversaturated, but never less than fascinating), shot framing (extraordinarily thoughtful), and performance. Godard allows his camera to linger on single faces, without cutting, for what seems by modern standards to be extremely long segments--perhaps even excruciatingly long--but the remarkably subtle cast members never disappoint, particularly the fantastically adept and frequently hilarious lead actors, Jean-Pierre L&#xE9;aud and Chantal Goya. The filmmaker has little to add to our collective understanding of the relationship between masculineetfeminine writ large; in fact, most of the female characters are uncomfortably stereotypical, framed as either willfully oblivious to the world or subtly (or overtly) deadly. But as an examination of a young generation faced with the prospect of war in Vietnam and the vagaries of French socialism,Masculin-F&#xE9;mininproves remorselessly and chillingly trenchant.  A towering influence, it would seem, on Whit Stillman's similarly themedBarcelona--but while Stillman lacks the conviction to follow his instincts to their logical, violent conclusions, Godard faces his uncompromising story with elegance and courage.

But panic ensues as the messenger lands and is shot by a nervous soldier. His large robot companion destroys the Capitol as the messenger escapes the confines of the hospital. He moves in with a family as a boarder and blends into society to observe the full range of the human experience.

After Robin and his community of outcasts and fighters take to the trees, director Kevin Reynolds (Fandango,187) is on more familiar narrative ground, and he goes for the gusto with lots of original action (Robin shoots two arrows simultaneously from his bow in two directions). Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, as Marion, makes a convincing damsel in distress, and Morgan Freeman brings dignity to his role as Robin's Moor friend.

{"description": "Director Andrei Tarkovsky's second film, ANDREI RUBLEV, is a massive and sweeping retelling of the life of the 15th-century Russian icon painter and perhaps the first great Russian artist. Unfolding in a free-flowing series of eight episodes, ANDREI RUBLEV follows the painter (Anatoli Solonitsyn) as he faces unbearable violence, endless attacks by the crude and malicious Tartars, and, eventually, a crippling crisis of faith. A moving mosaic of time, spirituality, dreams, history, culture, and politics, Tarkovsky's masterpiece was immediately condemned by the Russian authorities, who waited five years before giving it an official release. Despite this, the film endures as a wrenching testament to Tarkovsky's unique vision of the power of art and the duty of the artist. The film follows Rublev as he traverses the wretched earth of Russia in the Middle Ages, encountering jesters, fools, other artists, and the masses who eventually restore his faith in life and art. Tarkovsky's signature elliptical style, matched with stunning cinematography and breathtaking (and often nonnarrative) editing, creates a film unlike any other. Neither strict biography nor historical epic, ANDREI RUBLEV is the visual depiction of the mystical capacity for art to transform the struggles and joys of the human into the divine.

{"description": "Anthony Mann made some of the greatest Westerns of the 1950s, all in  partnership with James Stewart. Perhaps needing to prove himself as his own man,  in 1957 Mann dropped out ofNight Passageto do this film. It's a rather  schematic character study about a lawman-turned-bounty-hunter (Henry Fonda) who  undertakes the professional shaping-up of an effete young sheriff (Anthony  Perkins) too tentative to police the streets of his town. Those streets are  compositionally present right outside the oversize window of the office where  Perkins undergoes a lot of his soul-searching and arguments with Fonda. That's  typical of the film--scrupulously designed, yet abstract to the point of  dramatic aridity.

{"description": "Kathy Bates stars as an unhappy wife trying to get her husband's attention in this amusing and moving 1991 screen adaptation of Fannie Flagg's novelFried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe. After befriending a lonely old woman (Jessica Tandy), Bates hears the story of a lifelong friendship between two other women (Mary Stuary Masterson and Mary-Louise Parker, seen in flashback) who once ran a cafe in town against many personal odds. The tale inspires Bates to take further command over her life, and there director Jon Avnet (Up Close and Personal), in his first feature, has fun with the film. Bates develops a real attitude toward her thickheaded spouse at home and some uppity girls in a parking lot, but dignity is generally the key to Avnet's approach with the story's crucial relationships. Tandy is a joy and clearly loves the element of mystery attached to her character, and Masterson and Parker are excellent in the historical sequences.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301734734", "B00329TVQA", "630273973X", "6300247236", "6301398912", "B00000F5PI", "6300182304", "0800135954", "6300270971", "B00003CWL5", "6302800420", "B00004TJKK", "0790727382", "6300214222", "6304119046", "B0000DIXDR", "B0001E7LQG", "0800121600", "6304071876", "6302089654", "6300247031", "0790751089", "0792839846", "6303049079", "6300185095"], "bought_together": ["6301734734", "B00329TVQA"], "also_viewed": ["B00329TVQA", "6302526574", "6301734734", "630273973X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 292992}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.76, "brand": "Universal", "asin": "6302468027", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51M0F20RPAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fried Green Tomatoes [VHS]"}

{"description": "The British superspy with a license to kill takes on his dark underworld double, a classy assassin who kills with golden bullets at $1 million a hit. Roger Moore, in his second outing as James Bond, meets Christopher Lee's Scaramanga, one of the most magnetic villains in the entire series, in this entertaining but rather wan entry in the 007 sweepstakes. Bond's globetrotting search takes him to Hong Kong, Bangkok, and finally China, where Scaramanga turns his island retreat into a twisted theme park for a deadly game of wits between the gunmen, moderated by Scaramanga's diminutive man Friday Nick Nack (Fantasy Island's Herv&eacute; Villechaize). Britt Ekland does her best as the most embarrassingly inept Bond girl in 007 history, a clumsy, dim agent named Mary Goodnight who looks fetching in a bikini, while Maud Adams is Scaramanga's tough but haunted lover and assistant (she returns to the series as the title character inOctopussy). Clifton James, the redneck sheriff fromLive and Let Die, makes an embarrassing and ill-advised appearance as a racist tourist who briefly teams up with 007 in what is otherwise the film's highlight, a high-energy chase through the crowded streets of Bangkok that climaxes with a breathtaking midair corkscrew jump. Bond and company are let down by a lazy script, but Moore balances the overplayed humor with a steely performance and Lee's charm and enthusiasm makes Scaramanga a cool, deadly, and thoroughly enchanting adversary.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302510023", "6302510031", "630251018X", "630251004X", "6302510007", "6302380596", "6304047843", "6302510198", "630238060X", "6302380294", "B0000068SI", "B00008V2VP", "6304032579", "6302380588", "B000006FNX", "B00004TYS8", "6303651461", "6303651488", "6305784906", "B00004RWUH", "6302824613", "6303212263", "630596260X"], "bought_together": ["6302510023", "6302510031"], "also_viewed": ["6302380588", "6302510031", "6302510007", "6302510023", "B00004TYS8", "6302380294", "6304047843", "630251018X", "630251004X", "6303651488", "630238060X", "6303651461", "6302380596", "6302510198", "B00008V2VP", "6304032579"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 170742}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.58, "brand": "", "asin": "6302510015", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510E8WWVDZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Man With the Golden Gun [VHS]"}
{"description": "City Lightsis a film to pick for the time capsule, a film that best represents the many aspects of director-writer-star Charlie Chaplin at the peak of his powers: Chaplin the actor, the sentimentalist, the knockabout clown, the ballet dancer, the athlete, the lover, the tragedian, the fool. It's all contained in Chaplin's simple story of a tramp who falls in love with a blind flower girl (Virginia Cherrill). Chaplin elevates the Victorian contrivances of the plot to something glorious with his inventive use of pantomime and his sure grasp of how the Tramp relates to the audience. In 1931, it was a gamble for Chaplin to stick with silence after talking pictures had killed off the art form that had made him famous, but audiences flocked toCity Lightsanyway. (Chaplin would not make his first full talking picture until 1940'sThe Great Dictator.) After all the superb comic sequences, the film culminates with one of the most moving scenes in the history of cinema, a luminous and heartbreaking fade-out that lifts the picture onto another plane. (Woody Allen paid homage to the scene at the end ofManhattan.)

Though films of that year, such asKing Kong, still remain in the public psyche,Cavalcade, which is rarely seen now, fits the Academy's bill as an \"important\" film, one worthy of the Best Picture title. It chronicles the life of two British families, from the eve of the 20th century to 1933. One family is upstairs, the other downstairs, but it's less a view of the class struggle than a remembrance of things past. People honeymoon on theTitanic, they fight in the War to End All Wars, and they seem to entirely avoid the 1920s. Based upon Noel Coward's play, young couples banter using frightfully high-tea terms--everyone's \"dreadful,\" \"horrid,\" or \"pathetic.\" A final montage tirade about the decrepit state of the times (hey, they did it back then, too!) almost knocks the legs out from under the whole proceedings, but it holds on.

Zeffirelli diligently provides the sociopolitical background that gave rise to Jesus' following and the crisis in belief it caused for the people of Israel (and one or two Romans).

{"description": "This subtle, existential character study of an emotionally distant outcast (Nicholson) forced to confront his past failures remains an intimate cornerstone of American '70s cinema. Written and directed with remarkable restraint by Bob Rafelson, the film is the result of a short-lived partnership between the filmmaker and Nicholson--the first was the zany formalist exercise,Head,while the equally impressiveKing of Marvin GardensfollowedFive Easy Pieces.Quiet and full of long, controlled takes, this film draws its strength from the acutely detailed, nonjudgmental observations of its complex protagonist, Robert Dupea--an extremely crass and frustrated oil worker, and failed child pianist hiding from his past in Texas. Dupea spends his life drinking beer and sleeping with (and cheating on) his annoying but adoring Tammy Wynette-wannabe girlfriend, but when he learns that his father is dying in Washington State, he leaves. After the film transforms into a spirited road movie, and arrives at the eccentric upper-class Dupea family mansion, it becomes apparent that leaving is what Dupea does best--from his problems, fears, and those who love him. Nicholson gives a difficult yet masterful performance in an unlikable role, one that's full of ambiguity and requires violent shifts in acting style. Several sequences--such as his stopping traffic to play piano, or his famous verbal duels with a cranky waitress over a chicken-salad sandwich--are Nicholson landmarks. Yet, it's the quieter moments, when Dupea tries miserably to communicate and reconcile with his dying father, where the actor shows his real talent--and by extension, shows us the wounded little boy that lurks in the shell of the man Dupea has become.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302752329", "6302752337", "1558808590", "6300216500", "6303111874", "6300267865", "6301955293", "0800124693", "6301798759", "6303430910", "6304698305", "6300147355", "6304508557", "6301734734", "630018627X", "630442972X", "6305012792", "0783217528", "6303364772", "6302816416", "6302308208"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 152600}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.73, "brand": "", "asin": "6302757096", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HFH4VBEML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Five Easy Pieces [VHS]"}

{"description": "Jeff Bridges stars as an amateur boxer on a brief rise who catches the eye of an aging pugilist (Stacy Keach) heading downward in this 1972 film by John Huston and based on thenovelby  Leonard Gardner. Keach becomes the younger man's mentor, and the two hit central California's tanktown circuit of small matches for small money, interspersed with visits to smoke-filled bars and hellish gyms. Theirs is a cut-rate dream, all right, but as real and driving--and finally just as punishing--as the mythical black bird itself in Huston'sThe Maltese Falcon. The cast is outstanding, the cinematography by  Conrad Hall stunning, and the climax one of Huston's most painfully memorable. The story is filled out by surrounding detail that never leaves the memory: boxers and trainers who whisper of injuries that could put them out of business for good; a lone fighter who takes a bus into town, bides time in a crummy motel room, takes a beating in the ring, then leaves on the next bus with a few dollars in his pocket. This film helped re-establish Huston's reputation as a major filmmaker. It was followed by the likes ofThe Man Who Would Be King.--Tom Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 407924}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6302874807", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PC6SK671L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fat City [VHS]"}

{"description": "David Lynch's 1990Wild at Heartis an utterly random and ugly experience with pockets of startling imagery and inspired set pieces. Based on a Barry Gifford novel, the film stars Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern as lovers on the lam whose relationship is tested and who meet some truly dangerous wackos (including an almost-simian Willem Dafoe). Lynch's thoughts seem to be everywhere, and he expects the audience to keep up with a story that seems more a collection of avant-garde whims than a coherent vision with the intuitive brilliance of hisBlue Velvet. Cage gives one of his more chaotic performances, but then he was just reading Lynch's signposts.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009RRUKW", "6303515304", "B000P0J0D8", "B000063JDE", "0766202771", "6300182770", "6300248135", "6304510861", "6300214044", "6302914191", "6302390486", "0764005707", "0764005685"], "bought_together": ["B0009RRUKW", "6304510861"], "also_viewed": ["B000063JDE", "B007NYDVV6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 253011}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6303018351", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NA9YREH8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wild at Heart [VHS]"}

Nevertheless, it's a strong, unique piece that reflects upon the ubiquity of images in the modern world and the parallel subjugation of meaningful communication. Irene Jacob plays a fashion model whose lovely face is hugely enlarged on a red banner no one in Geneva can possibly miss seeing. Striking up a relationship with an embittered former judge (Jean-Louis Trintignant), who secretly scans his neighbors' conversations through electronic surveillance, Jacob's character becomes an aural witness to the secret lives of those we think we know.

But the film is less about the trappings of a conventional heist tale than about Melville's embrace of the form and his wistful weavings within it.

{"description": "There were only two ways for \"classicTrek\" cast members to appear in a movie with the cast ofStar Trek: The Next Generation: either Capt. Kirk and his contemporaries would have to be very, very old, or there would be some time travel involved in the plot. Since geriatric heroes aren't very exciting (despite a welcomed cameo appearance by the aged Dr. McCoy),Star Trek: Generationsunites Capt. Kirk (William Shatner) and Capt. Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) in a time-jumping race to stop a madman's quest for heavenly contentment. When a mysterious energy coil called the Nexus nearly destroys the newly christened U.S.S.Enterprise-B, the just-retired Capt. Kirk is lost and presumed dead. But he's actually been happily trapped in the timeless purgatory of the Nexus--an idyllic state of being described by the mystical Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg) as \"pure joy.\" Picard must convince Kirk to leave this artificial comfort zone and confront Dr. Soran (Malcolm McDowell), the madman who will threaten billions of lives to be reunited with the addictive pleasure of the Nexus. With subplots involving the android Data's unpredictable \"emotion chip\" and the spectacular crash-landing of the starshipEnterprise, this crossover movie not only satisfiedTrekfans, but it also gave them something they'd never had to confront before: the heroic and truly final death of a belovedStar Trekcharacter. Passing the torch to the Next Generation with dignity and entertaining adventure, the movie isn't going to please everyone with its somewhat hokey plot, but it still ranks as a worthy big-screen launch for Picard and his stalwart crew.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305587159", "6304415346", "B00008OSD3", "6303202004", "6300216802", "630273486X", "6301543408", "630021463X", "6300215830"], "bought_together": ["6305587159", "6304415346"], "also_viewed": ["6305587159", "6304415346", "B00008OSD3", "6300214400", "6301543408", "6300216802"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 333275}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6303909949", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516Y2CS1YML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek Generations [VHS]"}

{"description": "Sean Penn wrote and directed this character-driven drama about a divorced couple (Jack Nicholson and Anjelica Huston) whose relationship never recovered following the death of their daughter at the hands of a drunk driver (David Morse). When the latter's character, a deeply regretful and changed man, gets out of jail, Nicholson, as the vengeful dad, decides to go after him. As a director, Penn is not so good with fluid storytelling and camera clich&eacute;s, but he is amazing as an actor's director. The onscreen reteaming of former real-life lovers Nicholson and Huston is more than just a voyeuristic exercise: Penn ingeniously uses the duo's palpable friction to bring an often horrifying reality to the pain of a dead relationship.--Tom Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 574111}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6304039190", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZDH4MBKVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Crossing Guard [VHS]"}

Evoking utopias and dystopias fromBraziltoPeter Pan, Caro and Jeunet create a vivid but menacing fantasy city in a perpetually twilight world. In this rough port town lives circus strongman One (Ron Perlman), who wanders the alleys and waterfront dives looking for his baby brother, snatched from him by a mysterious gang preying upon the children of the town. Rising from the harbor is an enigmatic castle where lives the evil scientist Krank (Daniel Emilfork), who has lost the ability to dream and robs the nocturnal visions of the children he kidnaps, but receives only mad nightmares from the lonely cherubs. Other wild characters include the Fagin-like Octopus--Siamese twin sisters who control a small gang of runaways-turned-thieves--Krank's six cloned henchmen (all played by the memorable Dominique Pinon fromDelicatessen), and a giant brain floating in an aquarium (voiced by Jean-Louis Trintignant).

{"description": "Some people may sneer at this 1965 musical, but the truth is the film has earned its status as a perennially watchable romantic-drama, largely on the strength of a fun story and chemistry between stars Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer. Veteran filmmaker Robert Wise (The Day the Earth Stood Still) mostly stays out of the way of the film's appealing elements, which include a based-on-fact tale of Austria's von Trapp family, who fled their Nazi-occupied country in 1938. Andrews is delightful and even fascinating as Maria, who sheds her tomboyish ways as a novice nun to accept the mantle of adulthood, becoming matron of the motherless von Trapp clan. Plummer is matinee-idol handsome and gives a smart performance to boot, and the cast of young people and kids who make up the singing von Trapp children make a strong impression. Based on the Rodgers and Hammerstein stage musical, the score includes such winners as \"Maria\" and the future John Coltrane hit \"My Favorite Things.\"--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304400551", "6304178352", "6305123616", "B00000JS61", "6305282927", "B00000F6D1", "630233683X", "6304151306", "6302526574", "6303494390", "0792839846", "0792839129", "155890641X", "6303215734", "0788802194", "0788812807", "6301390725", "6303314015", "0788812408", "630150528X", "0790744759", "6303444202", "6300263673", "6302787068", "6304401132", "6302320402", "0788805533", "B00004TRD5", "6300246787", "6303854311", "B000056BRF", "0788805843", "0792151712", "B0041GWWUK", "6304500831", "6302091632", "6303168507", "630197736X", "6301586026", "6300207919", "6302642248", "6300215695", "0788806270", "B00005LL26", "B0000048YM", "6304089767", "5559477621", "6300275310", "6305229449", "6302178924", "6300277089", "6305750750", "6304331851", "6302936381", "B00000JKNP", "6300181111", "B0000AQZYM", "6300215814", "6300215830", "6300274195", "B002M2Z3BA", "6300213668", "B000035Z2S", "0788803743", "B00000491O", "B00000I1EM", "B00005RRG3", "B002HK9IDQ", "6301796535", "6305940932", "0783222955", "6303315305", "6302271991", "6301966317", "B00004RV8M", "0792840836", "6304100507", "6301972279", "0792837614", "6304546262", "B00005RRG5", "6303929338", "6302150620", "6300182304", "6305326940", "078881172X", "B0000E32WB", "6302816246", "6300215741", "6301792734", "B0000633ZP", "0800132009", "B00005RRG6", "B0002F6BQU", "B000059HH1", "6305177473", "B0000VCZKM", "6301971531", "0792839749"], "bought_together": ["6304400551"], "also_viewed": ["6304400551", "6304178352", "6303314015", "6305123616", "155890641X", "0788812408", "B00000JS61", "0788802194", "6302526574", "6302642248", "0792839129", "6305282927", "B00000F6D1", "078881172X", "6304500831", "6300274268", "6302158095", "6303215734", "B000035Z2S", "6304151306", "6304143184", "0792151712", "0788805843", "6304401132", "6302787068", "6300213668", "0788806270", "6301969707", "630233683X", "6305326940", "0792839846", "6305750750", "B00005LL26", "6302178924", "6304978286", "5559477621", "6303036813", "6303494390", "B00000JKNP", "6304539258", "6304873441", "6301792769", "6304290888", "6304718551", "B0041GWWUK", "B000003KHS", "6304089767", "6303929338", "6302091632", "6302961572", "B0007KTBIU", "6300263673", "6303675212", "6301752627", "6301792734", "B00FWMVVLS", "0783229011", "6304539274", "B00004TRD5"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 84952}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.94, "brand": "", "asin": "6304117752", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AESVTB4DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Sound of Music [VHS]"}

{"description": "Audrey Hepburn's last Oscar nomination was for this adaptation of Frederick Knott's famed stage thriller about a blind woman, a con man (Alan Arkin), and a doll full of heroin. Thanks to Hepburn's husband, a photographer who does a good deal of traveling, she's unknowingly come into possession of said doll, which was given to him on a plane by a comely young drug runner who winds up dead. The murderous Arkin, aided by sympathetic henchman Richard Crenna, will let nothing stand in the way of his obtaining it, even if it comes down to assaying multiple \"personalities\" in order to visit and terrorize Hepburn; Crenna is unwillingly enlisted to help. However, the \"world's champion blind lady\" (as Hepburn sardonically states) is more than up to the task of defending herself in her basement Manhattan apartment in a heart-stopping climax that to this day still defines the way horror movies with jack-in-the-box psychos are made. Despite the obvious staginess of it all (the entire action takes place in Hepburn's apartment), it still works magnificently, thanks to Hepburn's steely will and Arkin's deadly, sadistic madman. A helpful hint: turn out all the lights when you watch it; theaters back in 1967 did so, killing the guiding lights during the film's last 15 minutes. We can't tell you why, but trust us, it's worth it.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303631851", "6300215598", "6300215741", "0822212161", "6300251152", "6302878527", "0783222955", "6302241103", "6300215717", "0783235607", "6300181405", "6300181529", "B00004TRD5", "B0002IXSVI", "6305282927", "6300216721", "0783235593", "6301969316", "0790705141", "B000PYKZYC", "B00005RRG6"], "bought_together": ["0822212161"], "also_viewed": ["0783221347", "B006TTC5WC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 284024}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6304457383", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WC3EKH3DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wait Until Dark [VHS]"}
{"description": "The nuts and bolts of the irresistibly danceable music called Tejano are pop, rock, polka, R&B; and Latin influences. To millions of fans there's another vital ingredient: the dynamic singer Selena. Vibrant and tuneful, Selena is the story of the Grammy Award-winning South Texas singer whose life tragically ended just as she was taking Tejano where it had never gone-into mainstream America. Pulsating with Selena's voice on the soundtrack and made with the participation of her family, the film brims with authenticity. It excitingly recreates the early life of a little girl who dreamed big, hit the road in the band bus named Big Bertha and whose concerts became electrifying events. In the title rose, Jennifer Lopez is herself electrifying. Edward James Olmos, Jon Seda and others also shine in \"a poignant, heartwarming movie that deserves a standing ovation\" (Jules Peimer, WKDM-Radio/New York).", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767821637", "B00006I0CS", "B00009QG6R", "B00006JJ6T", "0451414047", "B00180IPM6", "B000GJ0LLI", "B00BLOYQ72", "B0000897EG", "B00006I0CZ", "B00069FL7C", "B000N3SU6K", "B000KJU15U", "B000000VKD", "B000RHRGSK", "B005HFI7IU", "B000A50460", "B004763SMU", "B0042EJDGM", "B000000VL8", "B005KA2J7W", "B00006HAWN", "B0016MJ6GU", "B004GGQMYM", "B000K2UGZM", "B00004Y2R1", "B000000VVL", "B000AM4P90", "0451414063", "B003NF97NK", "B00004ZESY", "B000A343RI", "B00AEFYOJE", "B0000524E5", "B000683VI4", "B00AEFY5TI", "B0007OCG56", "B00465I1CE", "B005FIXA6S", "B00003CXSM", "B00005TNEQ", "B0009HLC9W", "B0000AINIZ", "0767812387", "B008BKQZN2", "B00AMSNEEY", "B000000VM7", "B002ZG9968", "B000ERVK3A", "B00008K7AM", "B00006I0DB", "0425171248", "B00C1CO1JQ", "B00000K3TX", "B000FS9ULC", "B00AEBB9IM", "B000P0J0DS", "B00075VX2C", "B008KEQMDC", "B00005V9IA", "B00AEFY0F2", "0783114907", "B000YW8RNG", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00GJNQ3S0", "B000765IJK", "B0006SSMWE", "B00AEFXO8Q"], "bought_together": ["0767821637"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00B1LCLRM", "B00006I0CS", "B00006JJ6T", "0767821637"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 53824}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6304584229", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CVMPPGSML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Selena"}
{"description": "At his best, director John Woo turns action movies into ballets of blood and bullets grounded in character drama.Face/Offmarks Woo's first American film to reach the pitched level of his best Hong Kong work (Hard-Boiled). He takes a patently absurd premise--hero and villain exchange identities by literally swapping faces in science-fiction plastic surgery--and creates a double-barreled revenge film driven by the split psyches of its newly redefined characters. FBI agent Sean Archer (John Travolta) must play the villain to move through the underworld while psychotic terrorist Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) becomes a perversely paternal family man while using every tool at his disposal to destroy his nemesis. Travolta vamps Cage's tics and flamboyant excess with the grace of a dancer after his transformation from cop to criminal, while Cage plays the sullen, bottled-up agent excruciatingly trapped behind the face of the man who killed his son. His attempts to live up to the terrorist's reputation become cathartic explosions of violence that both thrill and terrify him. This is merely icing on the cake for action fans, the dramatic backbone for some of the most visceral action thrills ever. Woo fills the screen with one show-stopping set piece after another, bringing a poetic grace to the action freakout with sweeping camerawork and sophisticated editing. This marriage of melodrama and mayhem ups the ante from cops-and-robbers clich&eacute;s to a conflict of near-mythic levels.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792116887", "0792133153", "0800125762", "B00006IUNT", "6304259131", "6304681496", "B00004WIDB", "079212569X", "6302816629", "6304258984", "B00005PJ8I", "B00003CXTF", "B000007OY0"], "bought_together": ["0792116887"], "also_viewed": ["6304259158"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 280197}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.39, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "6304618344", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71PMMMZ3CYL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Face/Off [VHS]"}

{"description": "Halloweenis as pure and undiluted as its title.  In the small town of Haddonfield, Illinois, a teenage baby sitter  tries to survive a Halloween night of relentless terror, during which  a knife-wielding maniac goes after the town's hormonally charged  youths. Director John Carpenter takes this simple situation and  orchestrates a superbly mounted symphony of horrors. It's a movie much scarier for its dark spaces and ominous camera movements  than for its explicit bloodletting (which is actually minimal). Composed  by Carpenter himself, the movie's freaky music sets the tone; and his  script (cowritten with Debra Hill) is laced with references to other  horror pictures, especiallyPsycho. The baby sitter is played  by Jamie Lee Curtis, the real-life daughter ofPsychovictim  Janet Leigh; and the obsessed policeman played by Donald Pleasence  is named Sam Loomis, after John Gavin's character inPsycho.  In the end, though,Halloweenstands on its own as an  uncannily frightening experience--it's one of those movies that had  audiences literally jumping out of their seats and shouting at the  screen. (\"No! Don't drop that knife!\") Produced on a low budget,  the picture turned a monster profit, and spawned many sequels,  none of which approached the 1978 original. Curtis returned for two  more installments: 1981's dismalHalloween II, which picked  up the story the day after the unfortunate events, and 1998's occasionally  grippingHalloween H20, which proved the former baby sitter  was still haunted after 20 years.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005LC4Q", "B000FA57UI", "B000FA57US", "B000Q66Q2O", "B005CFC0N8", "B004P7CNUY", "B0000AOX09", "B004P7CM9Q", "B000VKL6Z2", "B00006LPHA", "B002XD0J80", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B001NPD9LS", "B002YICNE2", "B000GETUDI", "B000FS9FE4", "B001DJLD1W", "B00AEFY2LO", "B00006FI0R", "B00AEFY2WI", "B005CFBYW6", "B00006FDBT", "B00AEFY31S", "B00AEFY37C", "B00005K3NR", "B00004TS0G", "B003UGLCIA", "B0087ZG7UW", "B000I2J68M", "B000V4UFZK", "B0000VCZMK", "B0033B5XCS", "B000AM6OQ2", "B0002JP572", "B002VWNIDG", "B0058S0OMS", "B000099T3M", "B00AEFY1V0", "B002ZG971U", "B00AEFYYH6", "B00003CXCF", "B004LWZW2O", "B001B1UO6W", "B00006FDCD", "B000E1ZBIG", "B004SIP9MY", "B000TSIJWY", "B000WC3864", "B004AC6PMG", "B001DJLD0S", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B004P7CMT6", "B0002CHK1S", "B000FC2GA0", "B008CYDD7I", "B0008191WO", "B0024FADD8", "B0053TWVDC", "B00018D42W", "B00AEFY2AA", "B00DTPRZ24", "B000KJU1KK", "B00AEFY2E6", "B0000CEB6Y", "B0006SGYL0", "B00004Y87O", "B0013D8LAE", "B00005JA8B", "B006ZL1P66", "B000GBEWRU", "B000IMUYJM", "B005J9ZFQG", "B001JFZ1UE", "B007STBUHI", "B000E8M0P6", "6305972001", "B00079Z9WI", "B00005A8XX", "B00009PY4G", "B000FAOC2W", "B000AA4JL6", "B0002C4JJ4", "B0002O7XW2", "B008JFUNYG", "B000HEWEGC", "B002LMSWN2", "B00BM4Q4H6", "B000HCO86I", "B008874968", "0783227434", "B0006SSOHC", "B001JFZ122", "B004LWZW24", "B000Q66Q8I", "B00001QGUM", "B000OYCMLM", "B000PMLJMQ", "B00000ILDD", "B00A1AU72A", "B004SIP9E2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00KDU8HQQ", "B00005LC4Q", "B000VKL6Z2", "B002YICNE2"]}, "price": 19.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 349265}, "asin": "6304697961", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NXT68J3CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Halloween"}

{"description": "A little drunk on its own arcane exotica as a gambling movie,Roundersis a film that takes us inside a world of high-stakes card players but falls short on such essentials as character development, relationships, that sort of thing. Still, it is a real curiosity, written by a couple of guys (David Levien and Brian Koppelman) who appear to know something about the dark underbelly of card hustling for fun and profit. Matt Damon stars as a reluctant law student who can't put aside his subterranean career of playing poker and blackjack for big money. After he loses his post-grad nest egg to a weird Russian kingpin (John Malkovich)--and also loses his disgusted girlfriend (Gretchen Mol) in the process--Damon's character turns to an unreliable old buddy (Edward Norton) for a dangerous game of sharking wherever there happens to be a game underway: frat boys, cops, bad dudes, you name it. Norton appears to be living out every young actor's fantasy of re-creating Robert De Niro's prototypical head case in Martin Scorsese'sMean Streets, and while his performance is burdened by obvious quotation marks, his estimable talent still shines through. Damon's charm and intelligence bring some oomph to the curiously flat proceedings, and while his hushed, soul-bearing scenes with Martin Landau (as a law professor who takes a shine to the kid) seem gratuitous, they're still nice to watch. Behind all this is director John Dahl (Red Rock West), who is not exactly at the top of his game here but who brings his distinctive toughness to the crime-noir tone.--Tom Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 343634}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.18, "brand": "", "asin": "6305240655", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51565J9D9ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rounders [VHS]"}
{"description": "Angie Dickinson stars as a bank-robbing matriarch in this 1974  Roger Corman production, often described as a knock-off ofBonnie and Clyde. (As if that makes any difference regarding the worth of the film--which is  pretty good.) Set in Great Depression-era Texas, the story finds Dickinson's desirable and poor character driven to crime, along with her two  daughters (Susan Sennett, Robbie Lee), all of whom use sex to distract or drive  men into culpability. The film, directed by Steve Carver, is pure Corman  formula: fast-moving, violent, gritty, adorned with nudity, and yet solidly true  to its own sense of high drama and texture. Veteran Angie Dickinson brings solid acting chops (and a great bod on display) to the enterprise--and speaking ofEnterprise, William Shatner is quite memorable (as is Tom  Skerritt) as one of the gentlemen who fall under the antiheroine's sway.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0047DKLCI", "B0042FUHUW", "B006UKX6GO", "B00005K3NU", "B004AZ7ZLI", "B004IB04RG", "B006M3M5FM", "B004XIWRW4", "B004ULEENE", "B004RBC5U6", "B004ZKKKXI", "B005SQRYN2", "B00817MQBK", "B005BUA1FS", "B009R68H80", "B009R68HFI", "B004YMATCY", "B0030VANHQ", "B0058O1FES", "B0008KLVA0", "B004HHX9OQ", "B00005UM2Y", "B00ESZZOLI", "B002DQSKMY", "B005XB8T68", "B003XL6EIA", "B000E1EHPY", "B0055CP9HW", "B00ESZZOMM", "B00097DY2A", "B00FB349R6", "B0007R4T3A", "B005FQ2HEQ", "B00JDOQM38", "B00CG4XKSM", "B003VOVW0O", "B0007W6HVM", "B006OT0UUQ", "B00JDOQMH4", "B00EOYK616", "B00GRZPRB4", "B0062VL4YW", "B00049QJBG", "B00BLQBQYQ", "B002AT4JNI", "B000TZJCNM", "B00310PSVC", "B00EALTWHW", "B00HW3EJ6Y", "B0089AJDNS", "B004NJC0J8", "B005FQ2H9Q", "B0009GX1CE", "B00I5TYNZ6", "B007V6ON9A", "B00CWHWV7O", "B0010T3ULQ", "B003THSXJ6", "B000F0UUD2", "B00005RIY1", "B00HNTOVX8", "B00KFNF2T6", "B000YQUXJ8", "B0000UX5JS", "B000193318", "B000HT38EO", "B000EZ9084", "B0038SUBEG", "B00005U8EP", "B000069HZO", "B000OYCMLW", "B00CPTUO1Y", "B0038SUBF0", "B00EUEWR6W", "B00005JMU1", "B00ID8H98C", "B00K0MM4AM", "B000E3LKKM", "B003XMKU1G", "B006Z7Z3VS", "B004ZKKL3M", "B000059TOB", "6305308829", "B00310PSUI", "B002AT4JN8", "B004IB04NK", "076782170X", "B00B022GVS", "0792846877", "B004IN21VQ", "6305127654", "B001URA5Y8", "B006J6CEN0", "B000PMFRYC", "B00E8G5HXM", "B003THSXJG", "B00DDXEJE4"], "bought_together": ["B0047DKLCI", "B006M3M5FM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005K3NU", "B0047DKLCI", "B006M3M5FM", "B004HHX9OQ"]}, "price": 39.49, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 294545}, "asin": "6305261326", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/718QX8CM5VL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Big Bad Mama"}
{"description": "Robert Bolt's successful play was not considered a hot commercial property by Columbia Pictures--a period piece about a moral issue without a star, without even a love story. Perhaps that's why Columbia left director Fred Zinnemann alone to makeA Man for All Seasons, as long as he stuck to a relatively small budget. The results took everyone by surprise, as the talky morality play became a box-office hit and collected the top Oscars for 1966. At the play's heart is the standoff between King Henry VIII (Robert Shaw, in young lion form) and Sir Thomas More (Paul Scofield, in an Oscar-winning performance). Henry wants More's official approval of divorce, but More's strict ethical and religious code will not let him waffle. More's rectitude is a source of exasperation to Cardinal Wolsey (Orson Welles in a cameo), who chides, \"If you could just see facts flat on without that horrible moral squint.\" Zinnemann's approach is all simplicity, and indeed the somewhat prosaic staging doesn't create a great deal of cinematic excitement. But the language is worth savoring, and the ethical politics are debated with all the calm and majesty of an absorbing chess game.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000056HEA", "B0057FGCRI", "B0000B1A58", "B001D5F2LI", "B0006GANX2", "B00008J2PG", "B00005AUKE", "B000BITV92", "B0006HBV3W", "B000BYA4HE", "B00AEFY6DI", "B00008LDO7", "076781326X", "B000XJD34I", "B00012FXJ0", "B00004TVUD", "0780021312", "0385496931", "B0018LX9RG", "B004FQX5A2", "B003WEAW04", "B002QXOYQK", "0679728228", "B00003CXBH", "B000FFJ83K", "B001NSLE5I", "B0000549B1", "B00005JKF6", "B000KX0IOA", "B000255LIY", "B00006ADD5", "B00005AUKB", "B000KJTGHO", "B00003CXBU", "B001GLX6TY", "B00004XPPC", "B00AEBB9FA", "B000WMFZMY", "B00005JN8Z", "B00011D1OK", "0898706254", "B00125WAXM", "B0001US8F8", "B0000633QW", "B00006RCO2", "6304907729", "B001D8W7EU", "B00GHU35HM", "B000E1MXTG", "B00AMSM9CW", "0767827775", "B00096S412", "B001GUYAZY", "B0051WTN50", "B00005MEOU", "6305257450", "B002HK9IDQ", "B000E1MXT6", "B000FL7C9G", "B0009S4IKQ", "B000MTEGSG", "B0045HCJQM", "B002VWNIBI", "B000E1ZBFY", "B00011D1OU", "B000LXWAI6", "B00005V1WY", "B00D3K357O", "B006FE83UE", "B0045HCJJY", "B0006GANY6", "B0002BO05S", "B00006RCO3", "B00GA8Z0B0", "B0010AN7Z4", "B00F6SHECS", "B001MVYUQ6", "0783240171", "B00BYCOIU6", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B004XYOQU4"], "bought_together": ["B000056HEA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000056HEA", "0679728228", "B0057FGCRI", "B000255LIY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 125062}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.37, "brand": "", "asin": "6305252564", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-2r8McJlL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Man for All Seasons"}
{"description": "Werner Herzog's remake of F.W. Murnau'soriginal vampire classicis at once a generous tribute to the great German director and a distinctly unique vision by one of cinema's most idiosyncratic filmmakers. Though Murnau'sNosferatuwas actually an unauthorized adaptation of Bram  Stoker'sDracula, Herzog based his film largely on Murnau's conceptions--at times directly quoting Murnau's images--but manages to slip in a few references to Tod Browning'sfamous version(at one point the vampire comments on the howling wolves: \"Listen, the children of the night make their music.\"). Longtime Herzog star Klaus Kinski is both hideous and melancholy as Nosferatu (renamed Count Dracula in the English language version). As in Murnau's film, he's a veritable gargoyle with his bald pate and sunken eyes, and his talon-like fingernails and two snaggly fangs give him a distinctly feral quality. But Kinski's haunting eyes also communicate a gloomy loneliness--the curse of his undead immortality--and his yearning for Lucy (Isabelle Adjani) becomes a melancholy desire for love. Bruno Ganz's sincere but foolish Jonathan is doomed to the vampire's will and his wife, Lucy, a holy innocent whose deathly pallor and nocturnal visions link her with the ghoulish Nosferatu, becomes the only hope against the monster's plague-like curse. Herzog's dreamy, delicate images and languid pacing create a stunningly beautiful film of otherworldly mood, a faithful reinterpretation that by the conclusion has been shaped into a quintessentially Herzog vision.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 272814}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Nosferatu the Vampyre [VHS]", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000056NW6", "6302783356", "B000VUQ4HW", "6304509154"], "also_viewed": ["6302194296", "B00EO2I6RO"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5123FXMFFAL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "630526323X"}
{"description": "Ron Howard's breakthrough film as a director launched Michael Keaton as a screen comic. In this film, he is teamed with a hangdog Henry Winkler as a pair of night attendants at a city morgue. Thinking entrepreneurially, Keaton (as the flakier half of the team) convinces a reluctant Winkler that they could kill two birds with one stone and use their quiet surroundings to start a call-girl business. The first girl in the stable of these unlikely pimps: Shelley Long, pre-Cheers. Given the rather tasteless subject matter (ever really met a happy hooker?), it's surprisingly good fun, ignited by the chemistry between the nebbish Winkler and the jet-propelled Keaton, who seized this role and used it to shoot him to stardom--and into several years of stinkers. Meanwhile, the film was supposed to help Winkler segue from the Fonz onHappy Daysto a career acting in movies, but whatever happened to him?--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_viewed": ["6302800900"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 325882}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.98, "brand": "", "asin": "6305335796", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AN1VPQYPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Night Shift [VHS]"}

Denzel Washington is FBI special agent Hubbard, \"Hub\" to his friends, whose anti-terrorist task force must track down the terrorist cells responsible for a spate of bombings in New York.  His partner is an FBI agent of Arabian extraction (played convincingly by Tony Shalhoub), proving not all Arabs are bad guys--a point the film should be lauded for making again and again. Thrown into the mix is a CIA spy (played almost kittenish at times by Annette Bening), whose ties to the terrorists appear to be at the center of the conflicts.  When the bombings escalate out of control, the President institutes martial law, sending in General Devereaux (played with impenetrable countenance by Bruce Willis) with tanks and troops to ferret out the terrorists. Echoes of Japanese-Americans in internment camps ring out as Arabs, including the son of the Arab-American FBI agent, are herded into a stadium.

{"description": "Okay, you knew everyone in high school was just a little different: everyone looked at you strangely, the teachers were freaky, and you never could find the right groove to fit into. What if it turned out that it was all because your school was inhabited by creepy aliens from outer space?

Directed by Robert Rodriguez (El Mariachi), it'sThe Breakfast ClubmeetsInvasion of the Body Snatchers, as six disparate students from Herrington High School band together when they discover that an alien life form is invading both the student and faculty bodies, with plans to take over the world.Each of the heroes represents a different high school type: popular babe (Jordana Brewster), picked-on geek (Elijah Wood), goth girl (Clea DuVall), sensitive jock (Shawn Hatosy), new kid in town (Laura Harris), and bad-boy rebel (Josh Hartnett). The plot isn't much--a basic kill-or-be-killed premise spiked with a healthy shot of paranoia--but Willliamson and Rodriguez do a great job of building the tension slowly but surely. The suspense set pieces are genuinely frightening, and the film pokes fun at itself without deflating its scares; Williamson is a master at shifting gears from comedy to horror quickly and adroitly. The young cast doesn't have a weak link among them (with special kudos to Wood, DuVall and heartthrob-in-the-making Hartnett), and Rodriguez gets maximum mileage from the titular faculty, which includes Jon Stewart, Piper Laurie, Salma Hayek, Bebe Neuwirth, and Robert Patrick ofTerminator&nbsp;2.

When the destroyer investigates a mysterious noise heard from inside the derelict sub, Bell suffers a nervous breakdown, and it remains unclear whether the submarine specters were real or figments of Bell's survivor-guilt-ridden imagination.

He's hopelessly in love with this unbearable harridan (a dreadful lapse of dramatic logic), so he begs his scientist brother to be the first human to test a dangerous youth serum. The potion works too well, however, and the shrewish wife gets an unexpected comeuppance that's as deserved as it is dramatically unsatisfying. It's far from a classic episode, butTZcollectors take note: this is one of the few episodes to be withheld from syndication, so it's a relative rarity.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305760470", "6305760438", "6305701466", "6305772525", "B00004S89G", "6305701482", "6305837058", "B00004S89H", "6305669392", "6305669414", "B00004L8IR", "630587087X", "B00004Y7H7", "6305870888", "B00004L8IQ", "B00004W1A8", "6305944105", "B00004L8IO", "B000051S79", "B000046S2F", "B00004L8IP", "6305302316", "B00004REEI", "B00004Z4VN", "6305909520", "B00004Z4VO", "6305908419", "6305837031", "B00004L8IK", "B000055ZCY", "B00004W1A7", "B000046S2E", "B00004L8IN", "B000046S2D", "B00004L8IJ", "B00004RFAY", "6305944121", "B000055ZCW", "B000051S6M", "B000055ZCV", "B00005IA84", "B00000I20F", "B00004Y7H6", "B00004L8IM"], "bought_together": ["6305760470", "6305760438"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000046S2F", "B00004L8IN", "6305837058", "B000055ZCW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 283929}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 3.37, "brand": "KELLAWAY,CECIL", "asin": "6305772509", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516B488NSJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Twilight Zone: Vol. 20"}

{"description": "Lucille Ball is in fine pre-TV form--still more the glamorous redhead than the slapstick comedienne--inLured, Douglas Sirk's elegantly handled low-budget whodunit. Ball plays an American nightclub dancer in London, recruited by the police as a decoy for a serial killer--a maniac who finds his victims through the newspaper personal ads. The guilty party isn't difficult to guess, but the script by Leo Rosten is more literate than most such endeavors, and it's fun to watch our out-of-place heroine brazen it out in the London fog. George Sanders is the most cultivated of her suitors, and there's a weird sequence featuring Boris Karloff as a dress designer with crackpot designs on Lucy. Maybe best of all, the film has a crowd of good character actors:  Charles Coburn (as a Scotland Yard inspector who becomes protective of his amateur agent), Cedric Hardwicke, Alan Mowbray, Joseph Calleia, and especially George Zucco, a frequent movie villain in a sympathetic role as an avuncular cop.

{"description": "Gun Shyhad the misfortune to come along after several other \"killer pursues therapy\" movies/TV shows (Grosse Pointe Blank,Analyze This,The Sopranos); in this case, it's a DEA agent and not a Mafioso, but that wasn't enough to keep it from getting swept aside. Liam Neeson (Schindler's List,Rob Roy) plays Charlie, a government undercover agent whose last mission got botched, resulting in his partner's death. But the DEA isn't willing to let him get out early; clinging to his fantasy of a seaside retirement home, Charlie agrees to one more mission, even though he's convinced that the New York City gangster he's investigating will kill him. On his flight to the city, he meets a psychiatrist who encourages him to join a group therapy session. Meanwhile, it turns out that the gangster Fulvio, played by busy character actor Oliver Platt (Funny Bones,Bulworth), is equally miserable with his career. Curiously, Neeson and Platt both seem initially miscast--Neeson exudes a solid imperturbability, and Platt comes off as too soft to be really threatening--but over the course of the movie, their performances become increasingly compelling, perhaps because they are cast against type. Their neuroses, which initially seem like weak gags, start feeling genuine and sad.Gun Shyis marketed as a comedy, but its strength is in the truth of its characters. Sandra Bullock (who also produced the film) has a small role as a gastroenterologist with whom Charlie falls in love.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305736685", "B000M341SC", "B00066FB2A", "B00465I16K", "B0002IQLHQ", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B0000640RY", "B00000JGHN", "B000CEV3M8", "0783235380", "B00068GTK6", "B002SYAGNC", "B000058TLQ", "B000GB5M3S", "B0077ATSSQ", "B0045HCJGC", "B000CCBCHG", "B003498SCQ", "B00008G6E8", "B00FQRZ6EM", "B003M785HS", "B003IY498Y", "B002NZK5VO", "B00IARA8KM", "B00004UEDQ", "B0006GANOQ", "B0001GF24M", "B004A8ZX28", "B003L20IG0", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B00JA3RVG4", "B000EXDRLW", "B0000AYGBF", "B000A3XY5A", "B00441GZ46", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B002NZK5RS", "B00030WW4Y", "B002NZK5V4", "B00JL6L4UY", "B00AIBZMD6", "B005FH1RRI", "B00KM9LY3Q", "B00JU949TK", "B0002235QW", "B000QGDY0G", "B002NTDXQ4", "B00J5G1P2W", "079283366X", "6304765266", "B005LAIGRS", "B0007PALGG", "B000P6R5RK", "B002OVED88", "B00008L3UM", "B002ZG994U", "B00HF98SPS", "B00066FB52", "B000HEWEE4", "B00E8RKHWW", "B00HWWUR02", "B00J5JSV3A", "B000065K2V", "B008JFURII", "B00HEPE6MM", "B00008NRI7", "B008E70EES", "B00006ZXSQ", "B000BVM1S2", "B0037QGS0A", "B005NKIPUY", "0783237413", "B00CX7TOOG", "B002DU39GW", "B000046PUQ", "0767810872", "B004OB2EYQ", "B00015YVDG", "B002K0WBXW", "6305133409", "B003PIUIJC", "1558908382", "B000N4SHOO", "B00E44EZUE", "B00FFT1AZK", "B005LAIIRQ", "B00H1RMWYW", "B00DX88IKK", "B008JFUPPI", "6305822581", "B007C4ZJ0S", "B00HEPDGKA", "B0077ATSZE", "B000F7CMRM", "B0068MNO2U", "B00002E23C", "B002AS464Q", "B002ZG984Q", "B001KO1BCQ", "B004D9ADD8"], "bought_together": ["B000M341SC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AQ5905U", "B000M341SC", "B000CEV3M8", "6305736685"]}, "price": 7.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 94754}, "asin": "6305874867", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ADTC6E1BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gun Shy"}

{"description": "Considered by many to be Federico Fellini's most beautiful and powerful film,La Stradawas the first film to reveal the range of Guilietta Masina, whose poignant performance as the childlike Gelsomina recalls Chaplin's Little Tramp. The bubbly, waiflike Gelsomina is a simpleton sold to the gruff, bullying circus strongman Zampan&ograve; (Anthony Quinn) as a servant and assistant. Treated no better than an animal, Gelsomina nonetheless falls in love with the brute Zampan&ograve;. When they join a small circus they meet Il Matto (Richard Basehart), a clown who enchants Gelsomina and relentlessly taunts Zampan&ograve;, whose inability to control his hatred of Il Matto (literally, \"the Fool\") leads to their expulsion from the circus and eventually to the film's fateful conclusion. Masina is heartbreaking as the wide-eyed innocent, whose generous spirit and love of life leads her to try to \"save\" Quinn's unfeeling, brutal Zampan&ograve;. Though the film resonates with mythic and biblical dimensions, Fellini never loses sight of his characters, lovingly painted in all their frailties and failings. Fellini's lyrical style reaches back to the simple beauty of his neorealist films and looks ahead to the impressionistic fantasies of later films, but at this unique period in Fellini's career, they combine to create a poetic, tragic masterpiece.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300208591", "6301025083", "6305372594", "630347327X", "6303107338", "1572522089", "6301965752", "6302969352"]}, "price": 14.49, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 183076}, "asin": "B000001A5E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RP0J8B69L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "La Strada [VHS]"}

{"description": "Yasujiro Ozu's economical style reaches its zenith in this deceptively simple 1953 story of an elderly couple in rural Japan who go to visit their married children in Tokyo. Chishu Ryo (Ozu's favorite performer) and Chieko Higashiyama star as the aging parents who find a cold welcome waiting for them from their two urbanized children, too busy with work and their own lives to pay them any attention. After a miserable trip to a noisy spa, the mother spends a pleasant night with the widow of their other son (who had died in the war) while the father drinks the evening away with old friends. But on their return trip, the mother falls ill and the family reunites one last time at her sickbed. Within this simple framework, Ozu creates a quiet but profound drama of the changing face of Japanese culture and the loss of traditional values in modern society. Described by critics as Japan's most \"Japanese\" director, Ozu's style by this time had become firmly established: the entire film is shot from an unmoving camera 36 inches from the floor (the point of view of an observer kneeling on a tatami mat), edited in a subtly off-center manner and paced at a placid tempo. Ozu's graceful style, understated direction, and rich evocation of character creates an elegantly realized world of dignity in the face of disappointment and loss.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302969425"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 552474}, "asin": "B000006D1S", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QX2HMS9CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tokyo Story [VHS]"}
{"description": "Four people enter the Belasco Mansion, the so-called \"Everest of haunted houses,\" hired by a dying millionaire to investigate the possibility of life after death. Physicist Clive Revill leads the quartet, which includes his wife Gayle Hunnicut and two mediums. Pamela Franklin, young and impulsive, immediately makes contact with what she perceives as a tortured spirit, while Roddy McDowall, the only survivor from the previous investigation 20 years ago, closes himself off completely, deathly afraid of the malevolent forces that crushed his former comrades in body and spirit. Science fiction and horror legend Richard Matheson, responsible for penning such horror classics asThe Devil Rides Outand Roger Corman'sThe Pit and the Pendulum, brings a literate sensibility and a refreshing seriousness to the haunted-house genre with this adaptation of his novelHell House. Director John Hough follows Matheson's lead with a moody but sober approach, balancing the physical threats of objects lethally leaping to life with the slow, subtle possession of the characters by a truly evil spirit. Parts of the script feel like so much scientific mumbo jumbo, with characters discussing the finer points of supernatural manifestation and ectoplasmic activity, but Hough's deliberate direction gives it the necessary solemnity to take it all seriously.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 481003}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Legend of Hell House [VHS]", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303957064", "0764006770", "B00000F0I2", "6300214087", "B00004WLXE"], "also_viewed": ["B00JHH22O4"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HZ8RPGGYL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "B000006GFG"}
{"description": "David Lean's 1948 version of  Charles Dickens' classic novel begins with a bang: the young hero's pregnant mother fighting her way through a storm, a perfect metaphor for Oliver's difficult road ahead. Set in a world of slums in the shadow of Victorian England, the story traces the boy's life in a workhouse and then with a gang of little pickpockets.

{"description": "At first glance, Ren&eacute; Clair might seem an odd match for Agatha Christie's mystery thrillerTen Little Indians, but his buoyant touch is exactly what is missing from so many overly solemn remakes. Ten  strangers gather for a mysterious gathering on a secluded island. It turns out to be a farewell party, for they all have been sentenced to die for crimes in their past by a self-appointed judge, jury, and executioner who may be one of them. One by one, the guests are systematically dispatched in the manner described in the lyrics of the children's rhyme \"Ten Little Indians,\" while the survivors nervously eye one another, splintering into tenuous alliances until the next murder throws suspicion on someone new. The terrific cast of character actors has a ball with Dudley Nichols's witty script. The flamboyant sparring of Barry Fitzgerald (whose paternal Irish lilt takes a sinister dimension) and Walter Huston is almost upstaged by Roland Young's deadpan drollery. Romantic leads Louis Hayward and June Duprez come off as arch and stiff in august company that includes a sinisterly detached Judith Anderson, a dotty and distracted  C.&nbsp;Aubrey Smith, and a hilariously flippant Mischa Auer. The story has been  remade numerous times under the title of Christie's novel,Ten Little Indians, but never as well. Clair's effervescent, lively little gem is a fatal drawing-room comedy with a body count and a surreal mood of doom.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFYO5I", "B000CSTK38", "B001KP2J3U", "B001KP2J3K", "B001KZOVJK", "B001KP2J44", "B000GB5M1A", "B00005RDRO", "B0090XLDO0", "B00AEFXNXW", "B000GB5M1U", "B002Q3MYA8", "B000GB5M1K", "B00GAXASKS", "B000068UE9", "B008RNYMPG", "B00K6D1QV8", "B000199JJI", "B000059LGD", "B00000JGHT", "B00A0HT99G", "B00005Q4D6", "0062073486", "B00008K772", "006226589X", "B004VLYHNA", "B0045HCJHG", "B00E44EZUE", "B00DZP1C9K", "B002MUAXJY", "B00BBI7EZY", "B0002HOEQ2", "B00GAXASLC", "B004HHX9H8", "B00000ILEU", "B00GWXI16O", "B0023Y543Y", "B003YCI238", "B001D8W7EU", "B001V7YZAM", "B007ISJS0U", "B001UWOLQG", "B005X5XI4C", "B001V7YZ9S", "B0085A9IWS", "B000CCW2TS", "B00GWXHYPI", "B00J2CB9BQ", "B004WMOSNM", "B007RKFXTE", "B00008ZZ7B", "B000083C6R", "B005X5XINI", "B006JY3O2M", "B005ETAN7C", "B0087ZG7OI", "B00GWXI0S8", "B00AEBBA7W", "B001V7YZA2", "B00DW5IKWK", "B0028AENVC", "B009TTGKS4", "B0026ZQJP2", "B001SMC9L2", "B0083HXKM2", "B0033PSHB8", "B0045HCJ9E", "B00D7AM2V0", "B000GAKFIG", "B003AND1TG", "B002OQZE6I", "B0006212JK", "6305416222", "B001D8W7EK", "B002945DUM", "B0001ZMWT6", "B001ARDBXK", "B001BSBBGC", "B002GSXKQA", "B00BDSRM4K", "B00000C0QO", "B00EF0NYVI", "B000QGDJG0", "B006Z4LP9K", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B001BSBBDK", "B0047CG95W", "B00CVB6XF2", "B000CRR36K", "B000CC1TNI", "B00871C09S", "B0000797E7", "B001LMAK6A", "B000B8380A", "B009TTGLJM", "B008K1PXIK", "B008BSM1CI", "B000SUHOFG", "B000R1JI32", "B00GHH9I62"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFYO5I", "B001KP2J3U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFYO5I", "B00005RDRO", "B001KZOVJK", "0062073486"]}, "price": 9.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 85520}, "asin": "B00000IO3S", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21JR7V6YHQL.jpg", "title": "And Then There Were None"}

The resulting album,Buena Vista Social Club, became a Grammy-winning international bestseller. When Cooder returned to Havana in 1998 to record a solo album by 72-year-old vocalist Ibrahim Ferrer, filmmaker Wim Wenders was on hand to document the occasion. Wenders splits the film between portraits of the performers, who tell their stories directly to the camera as they wander the streets and neighborhoods of Havana, and a celebration of the music heard in performance scenes in the studio, in their first concert in Amsterdam, and in their second and final concert at Carnegie Hall. The songs are too often cut short in this fashion, butBuena Vista Social Clubis not a concert film. Wenders weaves the artist biographies with a glimpse of modern Cuba remembering its past, capturing a lost culture in music that is suddenly, unexpectedly revived for audiences in Havana and around the world. Wenders makes his presence practically invisible, as if his directorial flourishes or off-screen narration might deflect attention from the artists, who do a fine job of telling their own stories through interviews and music. It's a loving portrait of a master class in Cuban music, with a vital cast of aging performers whose energy and passion belie their years.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 455404}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.21, "brand": "", "asin": "B0000203Y5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41GCEV8VXXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Buena Vista Social Club [VHS]"}

At 178  minutes, it's long enough to establish the myriad inhabitants of Middle-earth,  the legendary Rings of Power, and the fellowship of hobbits, elves, dwarves, and  humans--led by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the brave hobbit Frodo  (Elijah Wood)--who must battle terrifying forces of evil on their perilous  journey to destroy the One Ring in the land of Mordor. Superbly paced, the film  is both epic and intimate, offering astonishing special effects and production  design while emphasizing the emotional intensity of Frodo's adventure.

{"description": "Hong Kongwuxiafilms, or martial arts fantasies, traditionally squeeze poor acting, slapstick humor, and silly story lines between elaborate fight scenes in which characters can literally fly.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragonhas no shortage of breathtaking battles, but it also has the dramatic soul of a Greek tragedy and the sweep of an epic romance. This is the work of director Ang Lee, who fell in love with movies while watchingwuxiafilms as a youngster and madeCrouching Tigeras a tribute to the form. To elevate the genre above its B-movie roots and broaden its appeal, Lee did two important things. First, he assembled an all-star lineup of talent, joining the famous Asian actors Chow Yun-fat and Michelle Yeoh with the striking, charismatic newcomer Zhang Ziyi. Behind the scenes, Lee called upon cinematographer Peter Pau (The Killer,The Bride with White Hair) and legendary fight choreographer Yuen Wo-ping, best known outside Asia for his work onThe Matrix. Second, in adapting the story from a Chinese pulp-fiction novel written by Wang Du Lu, Lee focused not on the pursuit of a legendary sword known as \"The Green Destiny,\" but instead on the struggles of his female leads against social obligation. In his hands, the requisite fight scenes become another means of expressing the individual spirits of his characters and their conflicts with society and each other.The filming required an immense effort from all involved. Chow and Yeoh had to learn to speak Mandarin, which Lee insisted on using instead of Cantonese to achieve a more classic, lyrical feel. The astonishing battles between Jen (Zhang) and Yu Shu Lien (Yeoh) on the rooftops and Jen and Li Mu Bai (Chow) atop the branches of bamboo trees required weeks of excruciating wire and harness work (which in turn required meticulous \"digital wire removal\"). But the result is a seamless blend of action, romance, and social commentary in a populist film that, like its young star Zhang, soars with balletic grace and dignity.--Eugene Wei", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007QS27K"], "also_viewed": ["B0007Q6VXC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 367958}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.95, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXR3", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G39T50SDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]"}

More satisfying is the 20-minute short on the state of comic books, featuring revealing comments from critics and authors including Frank Miller (of the touchstoneDark Knightseries). Seven deleted scenes are introduced by the director, and while none is significant to the plot, they are all must-see for fans of the film.

{"description": "A prime example of the American film noir style that flourished during the 1940s and '50s,The Big Combois now highly regarded as a stylistic milestone for its innovative use of deep shadows and harsh, singular light sources to define its visual strategy. This look is largely credited to the rule-breaking brilliance of cinematographer John Alton, who turns a standard plot of the era into a richly atmospheric experiment in visual invention. Ignoring conventional approaches to lighting, Alton defines the screen in terms of blackness, often framing characters as silhouettes cast in ominous grays or thick, roiling fogs. Moving from clarity to abstraction with masterful grades in between, Alton's trend-setting style has been celebrated by cinematographers since the film's release in 1955.The film's plot keeps brisk pace with the visuals, focusing on the obsessive efforts of a tenacious detective (Cornel Wilde) to destroy a sadistic mobster (Richard Conte) whose vicious influence has nearly ruined the life of the woman (Jean Wallace) he keeps under his dark wing. Lee Van Cleef and Earl Holliman are nicely cast as the villain's toady henchmen, and Brian Donlevy's usual limitations serve him well as the humbled, frustrated kingpin who's been stifled by Conte's ambition. Director  Joseph&nbsp;H. Lewis previously demonstrated his raw, stylistic vigor with the  earlier cult favoriteGun Crazy, and here he's in peak form with a perfect match of subject and sensibility. The result is hard-boiled entertainment that still packs a punch.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00EL6A7XE", "B00E21D9ME", "B00023P4GA", "B009X919UE", "B0009X7678", "B00E6AVGKI", "B00C3ALM02", "B000KJTGFG", "B00D09AXUA", "B0007ZEO7S", "B0080JG2GE", "B00FPUN21O", "B001CC7PM6", "B004C2523M", "B000B8384Q", "B000B8380A", "B00BGARG3C", "B000EXDSBQ", "B00ICWO1LC", "B00I9BU60Q", "B00023P4II", "B0007ZEO8C", "B0024FAG80", "B00023P4FQ", "B00023P4G0", "B0024FAG8A", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B000B83846", "B00DO0MEOS", "B00005RDRL", "B000CNE088", "B00CN70WS8", "B00005AUK9", "B00004W19C", "B000RXVND8", "B0006UEVVS", "B000LN6UHI", "B000EXDSBG", "B00I9BU3M2", "B00007ELD1", "B0009X7682", "B00DBE97S8", "B00004XPPK", "B0006Z2NE0", "B000087F79", "B00004W229", "B00I9BU3L8", "B000CNE08I", "B00BM4Q46M", "B00KIZY3XW", "B0000CNY4Z", "B0010KHOSU", "B00BM4Q4PI", "B0089LT800", "B0089LT7ZG", "B00H8J2NTC", "B004H0M2UK", "B002YNQEFG", "B00CVB6XF2", "B00097DXY4", "B000244EWY", "B0024FAG6W", "B00DZP1BVO", "B00006II5J", "B0000EYUDY", "B000244EX8", "B000BGH2NG", "B00I116MVQ", "B00B27WRJM", "B00AB2NX4M", "B00B27WQ6G", "B001CC7PLW", "B00005AUKD", "B000FKO3VC", "B00AEBBA7W", "B00012L786", "B000FKO3VM", "B0080JG2L4", "B00004RER5", "B00FX6TYZS", "B00005Y70U", "B006X0ZN3K", "6305770328", "B00005Y70Q", "B00457ZNS8", "B00AB2NX1K", "B00DZP1C9K", "B0009X766O", "B00JX3SHIC", "B006WQUGI2", "B00KIZYDCI", "B008BSM1CI", "B000PKG7CU", "B008BSM1XC", "B0010KHOSA", "B0026ZQJT8", "B005152C9G", "B00DBE98OG", "B00D9BNONW", "B000CNE08S"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BGARG3C", "B00EL6A7XE", "B0087ZG7OI", "B00E21D9ME"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 349701}, "asin": "B00003XALW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/714FYEYPNDL._SY300_.gif", "title": "The Big Combo"}

{"description": "The latest adventures of the four women of the Knight Sabers are not a continuation, but an alternate version of their earlier escapades. In 2040, much of the labor in Tokyo is done by Boomers, robots initially manufactured by Genom to rebuild the city after a devastating earthquake. Unfortunately, Boomers sometimes go berserk and attack humans. Only the Knight Sabers, a cadre of female vigilante mercenaries who fight in high-heeled armor suits, can really tackle a rogue Boomer. Klutzy Linna Yamasaki comes to Tokyo hoping to join the Knight Sabers. A rampaging Boomer brings her into contact with the women of the squad: motorcycle-riding rock singer Priss Asagiri, AD Police officer Nene Romanova, and lingerie-boutique owner Sylia Stingray, who heads group. Linna eventually persuades them to give her a tryout. Despite the hard-hitting action scenes, the story begins very slowly, and the characters aren't terribly appealing. Priss is given to sullen silences, Nene sounds like a case of arrested development, and Linna inexplicably shifts between small-town innocent and defiant rebel. The men are all jerks and/or lechers. The settings look less like the blighted dystopia of the earlier entries in the series and more like a standard-issue Tokyo-of-the-Future.

Stage directors Alex Olle and Carlos Padrissa's demented  take on a work that has been variously staged or presented simply in concert  form is so disastrous that it's actually worth a look. (In its defense, it's  possible that this staging needed to be experienced in person, where its  physical monumentality might have approximated themasterly score.)Musically, this is a superlative performance: Paul Groves is a sympathetic  Faust, Willard White is an appropriately menacing Mephistopheles, and Vesselina  Kasarova is an exquisite Marguerite. Sylvain Cambreling sensitively conducts the  Staatskapelle Berlin, and two excellent choirs' vocal contributions should not  go unnoticed.

{"description": "Named after a Buddy Holly song and set to a score of early American rock hits, Claude Whatham's story of a restless working-class lad in Britain the late 1950s (reportedly inspired by the early life of John Lennon) is a portrait dissatisfaction and disaffection. Real-life rocker David Essex (of the hit single \"Rock On\") stars as a Jim MacLaine, a schoolboy who chucks it all in a spontaneous rebellion. Not so much an angry young man as simply frustrated and directionless, he drifts through seasonal jobs, scamming girls with his veteran carnival buddy (a cocky Ringo Starr with rocker sideburns) and killing time in dance clubs. The overwhelming emptiness finally sends him wandering back to his dreary hometown for a more respectable life, but it's no better fit. While music is never the focus of the film, the nascent rock & roll scene simmers around the edges through American records and British cover bands (Billy Fury and Keith Moon appear in cameos). The drab small towns and chilly seaside holiday camps evoke a stifling sense of conformity and social stagnation--think of it as a uniquely British take onRebel Without a Cause--that becomes the crucible for the rebellious British rock & roll explosion around the corner. It's considered to be one of the great rock films, and it spawned a sequel,Stardust.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B0009JO43Q", "B000KRNMSA", "B0041KWOJU", "B003ZJ9568", "B0007WQGTK", "B001EJW0SG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0009JO43Q", "B000KRNMSA"]}, "price": 28.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 366361}, "asin": "B00004Y6AR", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RJWJYB71L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "That'll be the Day"}

{"description": "After 1952'sThe Bad and the Beautifulskewered Hollywood with a scathing attempt at self-analysis,The Big Knife(1955) finished the job of exposing the slimy underbelly of the studio system. This high-gloss noir, cynical to the bone and altogether hysterical in its potboiler theatrics, is a deliriously entertaining mid-'50s melodrama, adapted from the play by Clifford Odets (who brought a similar brand of vitriol toSweet Smell of Success) and starring Jack Palance in a role that transcended his trademark villainy. Palance is quite effective as rising star Charlie Castle, whose continued ascension in Hollywood depends on his willingness to renew a contract with studio bully Stanley Hoff (Rod Steiger), who treats Charlie like an indentured servant and, even worse, has plenty of dirt to hold against Charlie if he doesn't cooperate.Trapped between stardom and a desperate desire to reconcile with his neglected wife (Ida Lupino), Charlie's facing a no-win scenario, haunted by the indiscretions of his past. Palance's overwrought performance is perfectly keyed to director Robert Aldrich's typically histrionic approach; he's eclipsed only by Steiger, whose Method madness has rarely been as outrageous as this (his character was partially based on studio honcho Jack Warner). Set primarily in the well-appointed den of Charlie's Bel-Air manse,The Big Knifeis stagy but stylish, with Charlie's home taking on the appearance of a gilded cage as his predicament intensifies. Add a stellar supporting cast, and you've got film noir at its finest--dark souls baking in the California sun.--Jeff Shannon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 396944}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B000059ZVW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HSVSVAQDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Big Knife (Amazon.com Exclusive) [VHS]"}
{"description": "When Sarah (Neve Campbell) strikes up a conversation with a sad-eyed man called Alex (William H. Macy) at her therapist's office, she asks, \"Are you one of those middle-aged guys who's tired of his marriage and thinking maybe a beautiful young thing could help him out?\" She's right, but the source of Alex's depression is far from typical: he's a second-generation hit man who wants out, but his mom and dad won't let him quit.Donald Sutherland makes Alex's laconic and utterly monstrous father the most frightening parent since John Huston inChinatown. A series of flashbacks show how he introduced Alex to his trade, beginning with shooting squirrels in the woods. We never find out whether Alex's father has mob connections, and the fact that it's just a business to him (\"This one's a big job, lots of moola, I'll buy your mother a Lexus\") makes him all the more chilling. Alex's mother (the steely Barbara Bain) knows all about the family business, but his wife (Tracey Ullman) thinks he runs a mail-order company, and the only person he confides in is a therapist (John Ritter). When he meets and falls for Sarah, Alex realizes that he alone can stand up to his father, and he needs to act before his own son becomes the next apprentice.Henry Bromell's debut film as a writer-director probes the same dark corners of the middle-aged male psyche asAmerican BeautyandThe Sopranos. Alex's tormented life is a symbol of the damage that parents can inflict on their children, and Bromell imbues his story with a tragic inevitability.Panicreceived a shamefully limited theatrical release, in spite of its rare combination of a great script and brilliant performances.

Now, as Maud and Roland embark on a wildly romantic journey in search of the truth, the mystery of the past will engulf them, as the passions of the present possess them.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SUDQ22", "B000BOH904", "0679735909", "B00AEBB8P6", "B001RJ1Y62", "B004SIP7AS", "6305692696", "B000JJ5G4W", "B00I6JODGO", "B00005JOA0", "B002AT8KAG", "B006YTGL3G", "B004XVMCMQ", "B00005JMJD", "B00HUAGZ34", "0767812115", "0800141660", "B00005ALMM", "B000ZS8GW6", "B000Z27HLS", "B002ZFEQ76", "B004499LWG", "B005T0OY5S", "B004SIP9U6", "B00005OBAL", "0788815490", "B004SIP7D0", "B000EBD9VC", "B004SEUIZG", "B00006FD9P", "B000784WNQ", "B000N4SHOE", "B000EDWLTQ", "B004P7CNZO", "B00003JRCQ", "B0080QOL10", "B004AE3QYE", "B00AF82WTO", "B004U7MQZ6", "B00G6HO368", "B00005LOKU", "B006YTGL86", "B00F1BFRA6", "B0001US61O", "B0064MT1U8", "B005CFC0HE", "B004BZ5AGY", "B004P7CMUU", "B004SIP8JI", "0790730979", "0767020308", "B0018M6J90", "B000F3UAFC", "B00005JPSM", "B000LPQ6DE", "B001C4AFOY", "B0000372I3", "B004JMSIQS", "0767847415", "B006GL8NTW", "B002WY65VA", "0767806786", "B007A2O3FO", "B00GS08Y3Q", "B0001US7Q8", "B0000AQS3P", "0767815718", "B00023BKO0", "B00062IZ0Y", "0826452485", "B000E1ZBGS", "B00B89WZG4", "B000BITVAG", "B0045O2PHS", "B00AZMFO6I", "B00CIOD6HK", "0790732947", "B0080QOL1A", "B004QDRW0S", "B00JAQJMJ0", "0679738290", "B002I5GNZQ", "B0000844LU", "B003EA45EA", "B0007NFLO0", "B009T6CXG0", "B000CEV3M8", "B000M2E32M", "B00005YUNK", "B000NOIX48", "B000085OY1", "B00004WI57", "B00003CXC9", "B00AKGG6JS", "B001L57ZZG", "B004EQAVHI", "B0001GOH7K", "0783239416", "B00G7QPXAI", "B0046ZYEUW"], "bought_together": ["B000BOH904", "B00AEBB8P6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0679735909", "B000BOH904", "B00AEBB8P6", "B004SUDQ22"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 39150}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.41, "brand": "PALTROW,GWYNETH", "asin": "B00005JKKY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51220SPRBNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Possession"}
{"description": "Antoine Fuqua (THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS, BAIT) turns up the intensity level with TRAINING DAY, a charged drama about police corruption in downtown Los Angeles. Ethan Hawke stars as Jake Hoyt, a well-intentioned young officer who thinks he's found his ticket to becoming a detective in the form of undercover officer Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Harris is a notorious figure in the streets and in the office. He also has the authority to make Jake's professional wishes come true, provided Jake is able to prove his worth on Alonzo's team. At first, Alonzo's blunt, carefree demeanor provides a shock to Jake's optimistic system, but as it becomes clear that Alonzo is dangerously out of control, Jake must decide whether or not to risk his future in the name of the law.\n\nWashington's performance as the evil, pragmatic detective is a sight to behold. He delivers his lines with a devilish ferocity that keeps the film bubbling throughout. Hawke slips into the role of the rookie everyman with ease, providing a good contrast to Washington's fiery presence. Former video director Fuqua completes the picture by casting musicians Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and Macy Gray in supporting roles.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792841778", "630268644X", "6303012140", "6300214826"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 428216}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.0, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005JKEC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/415AYTB1GNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Training Day [VHS]"}

{"description": "The plethora of extras on this two-disc set are worth your time. There are several well-produced segments on the physical aspects of the film highlighted by a tour of the vast Cinecitt&#xE0; Studio sets with director Martin Scorsese and production designer Dante Ferretti (with a 360-degree-view feature to boot). Historian Luc Sante introduces you to the Five Corners area in New York circa the mid-19th century, and there's a vintage vocabulary guide (from the 1859 edition ofThe Rogue's Lexicon). Even though it was made as a \"puff piece\" for the movie, the Discovery Channel show \"Uncovering the Real Gangs of New York\" is an informative half-hour on the film's historical background. There's another espresso double-shot from a Scorsese commentary track. Not recorded traditionally as he watches the movie, the track pieces together thoughts from the director including some recorded in an NPR interview. This allows Scorsese to be even more focused, dealing with the history of the time and his own 30-year struggle to make the film. One serious demerit for stretching the feature film over both discs, which most likely had to be done with having both Dolby 5.1 and DTS tracks along with the commentary on the long film.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000M341QE", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00080ZG10", "B00AEBB8NI", "B006OFN0SE", "B00005JLSB", "B000C20VPA", "B000MZHW40", "B001N44BVQ", "B002ZG980U", "B000P0J09M", "B00049QQHI", "B004SIP8ZM", "0767830555", "6305313687", "B0006GAOJA", "B00008975Z", "B0016Q2D66", "B0000DI87S", "B00008DP4C", "B00011CZRE", "B000P0J0EW", "B00004XPPB", "B008R65XYC", "B005LAIIJY", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000C20VRS", "B004SIP95G", "B000286RP2", "B002CPMB9O", "B002T9H2LA", "0307388980", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000A7DVR2", "B00AEFXKUI", "B008MILL8W", "B00AEBB9F0", "B001EZE5DI", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004FQX5B6", "B002QEHPQU", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00H9KKGTO", "B004SIP6GI", "B002VWNIEA", "B0001FGBUW", "B000A2UBN4", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00003CWM3", "B008D1Q1VA", "B00005V9HH", "B003ASLJQI", "B003ASLJQS", "B007SPPANM", "B000093FLA", "B00003CXZ4", "B00004XPPG", "B00001ZWUS", "B000H5TH20", "B000FKO5QK", "B002ZG99N6", "6304711905", "B0018CMJSU", "0767817710", "B009AMANBA", "079284646X", "B000FS9FCG", "B000065U1N", "B00AEBB89W", "B000P0J0AG", "B004SIP6QI", "B001QTXM5Y", "B004499LWG", "0783227906", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000J4P9P8", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00AEBB95K", "B000NOKFHQ", "B002VWNICC", "B00009W5CA", "B004U7MR14", "B004AOECXI", "B00003CXRM", "0783231202", "B000069HZP", "0783229526", "B001JIE7JC", "B00005221M", "B000N6TX1I", "B00005JMJG", "B000N3SRO0", "B00003CXWV", "B00005JMYI", "B003HKN52U", "0790732238", "B00004U103", "B003UESJHO", "B000P0J09C"], "bought_together": ["B000M341QE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002ZG980U", "B000P0J09M", "B0013FXWU6", "B00H9KKGTO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 46244}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.89, "brand": "Miramax", "asin": "B00005JKN9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516W0haa4aL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gangs of New York (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "The first disc starts with a 38-minute interview with Salma Hayek that, with her recollections of the film, works the same as a commentary track. Director Julie Taymor takes center stage for the rest of the 2-disc set. Besides an engaging commentary track, there are two interviews with the director, a Q&A; session after an AFI screening, and a better one with Bill Moyers. The second disc is set-up for short (5- to 7-minute) featurettes on the making of the film--production design, cinematography, locations, two visual effects pieces, and so on--but oddly not one with the Oscar-winning make-up crew. All of these segments are better produced and more interesting than most DVD supplements, however there is little biographical information on Frida (letting the movie speak for itself). The music element gets the most attention: an interview with vocalist and Frida's lover Chavela Vargas, Hayek interviewing composer Elliot Goldenthal, and Goldenthal's own commentary track explaining his Oscar-winning score.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0030T120A", "B00005KHJJ", "B000CCCZYA", "B00116GEJ8", "B004XVMCMG", "B0001US61O", "B003ODIV10", "B000BYA4HY", "B005TTEG3O", "0060085894", "B0011FLH14", "B0043CT8GI", "B00006LLNV", "B001CK7OLU", "B000AL72R8", "3822859834", "B0041I97CO", "B000N3T0DW", "B005CFBZ3O", "0060923199", "B003WKQ46E", "B00005JNCZ", "0517592355", "B000WZAE7W", "B0006GANX2", "B0051URXWM", "B000FIHN5M", "B0000A2ZU1", "B001ILTUKQ", "0448426773", "B0009K7RXY", "B0002TT0MI", "B00180IPM6", "3836512645", "B00005N8A9", "B0041KKYF6", "B000NO1XG8", "0810959542", "B000YKYT2G", "1451632835", "B00134PSV8", "B00EV1YZKK", "B000NVI0EY", "B002ZMZBIM", "B00005JLQW", "1452108250", "B00AZMFKXK", "0060166991", "B00005R87F", "B000AM4P90", "B004IF4EVY", "B000EZ9084", "B001CK7OM4", "B000T5O4AI", "B00GJNQ3S0", "0486413500", "0486413667", "B000O76ZQC", "B00008AOX5", "B004U7MR1Y", "B001DJ7PR8", "B00275EGNS", "B003VTKZ8O", "B00E5G03KM", "B000NOIX48", "B0002KPIQY", "0452286867", "B001FM7KRI", "B000063N9O", "B000YIGNCC", "B00005JMJD", "0811800393", "3822858625", "6304806418", "B0031REQKE", "B004CJQVQC", "B00049QJ9I", "0516264664", "B000063K0I", "B00008PHD1", "0780619587", "B001BWYT4E", "B000LV6OC6", "B0016LFG2Y", "B006HAJAGM", "B000K7VHNW", "B00005JH9M", "B000NTPG84", "B0016MJ6T2", "B001QUF3SW", "B00BLYCB1K", "B0019K4YT8", "B0064MT1FI", "B00GPPXNIK", "B003BR8MDQ", "B000AARKOO", "B0015ET3YO", "1573440299", "B000092T3B"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000CCCZYA", "B00005KHJJ", "0060085894", "B004XVMCMG"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 123302}, "asin": "B00005JLPK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F4umWFdiL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Frida"}
{"description": "An enormously entertaining (if somewhat shallow) affair from blockbuster   director Steven Spielberg. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Frank Abagnale,  Jr., a  dazzling young con man who spent four years impersonating an  airline pilot, a  doctor, and a lawyer--all before he turned 21. All the  while he's pursued by a  dedicated FBI agent named Carl Hanratty (Tom  Hanks), whose dogged determination  stays one step behind Abagnale's  spontaneous wits. Both DiCaprio and Hanks turn  in enjoyable  performances and the movie has a bouncy rhythm that keeps it  zipping  along. However, it never gets under the surface of Frank's drive to lose   himself in other identities, other than a simplistic desire to please  his father  (Christopher Walken, excellent as always), nor does it  explore the complex  mechanics of fraud with any depth. By the movie's  end, it feels like one of  Frank's pilot uniforms--appearance without  substance.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00080ZG10", "B006OFN0SE", "B000M341QE", "B00AEBB8NI", "B001EZE5DI", "B004SIP7TE", "B000MZHW40", "0767905385", "B00005JMYC", "B002ZG980U", "B00049QQHI", "B0016Q2D66", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00003CWM3", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000P0J0EW", "B00008DP4C", "B000PHVZNE", "B001N44BVQ", "B00005JOC9", "B004SIP7ZS", "B0007DFJ0G", "B007SPPANM", "B00H9KKGTO", "B002T9H2LA", "0800141806", "B000N6U0E2", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEBB89W", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00001ZWUS", "B0050546MS", "B00DHHWXYY", "0783225733", "6304711891", "B00AEFY0F2", "B002VWNIEA", "B0051MKNV8", "B002ZG99N6", "B0077ATSSQ", "B00011CZRE", "B0013XZ2QK", "B00275EGWY", "B00005JKBC", "B00003CXWV", "B002O5M4T4", "B002FU8IWU", "B008MILL8W", "B004XQO90O", "B004SIP95G", "B000YAF4MA", "B005LAIIJY", "B00005JMJG", "B002QEHPQU", "0780631536", "B00DHDDE32", "B0031OCY2E", "0783240295", "B000P0J0BK", "B004FQX5B6", "B0034G4OUO", "B005HWAOP2", "6305313687", "B003UESJH4", "B000YABYLA", "B00005JKWX", "B00BEIYL6G", "B0058JEHSO", "B000A7DVR2", "B0002ZDVEU", "B00003CXZ1", "B00003CXQ4", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005RYLX", "B001VPCINK", "B000FKO5QK", "B0045HCJRG", "B009POCG0Y", "B00AEBB9SM", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B002DU39GW", "6304806434", "B00JQYV0B4", "B00AEFXE9U", "B00004WG2F", "B000EXZFCQ", "B00005JMCN", "B00006RCNV", "B000K7VHQE", "B00441GYXS", "B00A24CAAW", "B0045HCJ8K", "B004SIP9Z6", "B002NZK5R8", "B000K7VHTQ", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00005JL78", "0783233477", "B000J3OTT6", "B000O77SRC"], "bought_together": ["B00080ZG10", "B000M341QE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004SIP7TE", "B002ZG980U", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00ALTQRPW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7335}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.99, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JLSB", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51bPnAto--L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Catch Me If You Can (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)"}
{"description": "Such a simple idea--yet so fiendishly complex in the execution.24, as surely everyone knows by now, is a thriller that takes places over 24 hours, midnight to midnight, in 24 one-hour episodes (well, 45-minute episodes if you subtract the commercials). Everything takes place in real time, which means no flashbacks, no flash-forwards, no handy time-dissolves. Every strand of the plot has to be dovetailed and interlocked so things happen just when they should, in the right amount of time. Not that easy.Creator Robert Cochran and his team of writers and directors have done an impressive job of putting the jigsaw together and keeping the tension ratcheted up high, as federal agent Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) runs around L.A. trying to stall an assassination attempt on an African American presidential candidate and rescue his wife and daughter from the clutches of the Balkan baddies. Twists, turns, revelations, and cliffhangers are tossed at us with satisfying regularity. It's not perfect: we get some hokey plot devices (instant amnesia, anybody?); the final twist makes no sense whatsoever; there are altogether too many huggy family moments; and as for Dennis Hopper's \"Serbian\" accent....Even so, this is undeniably mold-breaking TV. Sutherland, rescuing his career from the doldrums in one heroic leap, fully deserves his Golden Globe.

{"description": "It's not that the folks at Pixar are geniuses when it comes to DVDs... well, come to think of it, their fifth DVD set shows these folks are wizards. It's not just that the two discs are packed with watchable extras that hardly reiterate the same information; it's how they are handled--funny, inventive, with a light touch--unlike many PR-driven discs. A good place to start is the filmmakers' jolly commentary track, which branches off into 31 minutes of behind-the-scene stuff, deleted scenes, and curious anecdotes (they can also be watched separately). Pixar's first making-of documentary is a most concise and interesting 25-minute examination that also sheds light on how the company works. With a digital-to-digital transfer, the film looks great and is available in widescreen or reformatted to full screen. The \"Family Fun\" disc includes another Pixar made-for-the-DVD gem, the 7-minute \"Exploring the Reef\" with Jean-Michel Cousteau (Jacques's son) being upstaged by Dori and Marlin; it's a hoot and teaches a fact or two you will remember about reefs. Both discs feature lovely menus that can be turned into virtual aquariums for your TV (by removing the text) featuring the knockout colors of the film's settings. Watch long enough for some shenanigans from the film's characters and vocal talent. Genius, pure genius.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00EV1YZ96", "B00AFEX83C", "B00007LVCM", "B00005JNS0", "B0030IIZ4M", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B003ZHVJGO", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00003CXB4", "B001KVZ6FW", "B0013FSL3E", "B004HO6I4M", "B00005JN4W", "B000MV9026", "B004G600A4", "B000AY74OG", "B000VBJEEG", "B0006UEVT0", "B008YWY0HK", "B003H9M1Q2", "B00CQRN3QI", "B0001I561E", "B0042U94UQ", "B00E9ZATJO", "B000YERP2S", "B0006JMLRK", "B000AAF1TU", "B0000AOX0O", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00F522C7C", "B0039N74CW", "B00003CXCQ", "B001ILFUDC", "B00275EHJG", "B001HN6922", "0736429220", "B000B8QG4A", "B000RMJ4F8", "B0084IHVN4", "B002ZG97YM", "B001ECQ75A", "B004ZBACOE", "B0030IIYYS", "B0084IHVGG", "B00E9ZATKI", "B00AO686JC", "B000GUJZ00", "B00004R99S", "B0012EM5D8", "B0084IHVUC", "B0013ND30M", "B0034JKZ86", "B0000VV4W2", "B00003CX8Y", "B008JFUQ16", "B001DPHDCY", "B00005TN8K", "B00CUDD0C0", "B00A83075M", "B001O5LVPI", "B001NCDFTW", "B00G7TIKMI", "B0000E32WJ", "B00CWM58WY", "B001ILFUD2", "B00009YXAW", "B00CMY3JBO", "B00335EQ0E", "B005LAIISA", "0783231474", "B0002YLCOM", "B00E00OGE2", "B000H7JCK0", "B000UVKGPI", "B00005JMQZ", "B00JK531ES", "B00004U9WQ", "B005LAIH4A", "B005LAIHW2", "B00024I2Z4", "B00I6JOD2S", "B008NNY9QW", "B0000VCZKM", "B00FE8BVF6", "6302526574", "B004EPZ034", "B000L22SG6", "B001OMU6UM", "B00E56D8FO", "B0000524D0", "B002WJI2QQ", "B0009CTT6U", "B000050MN3", "B000B8QG3G", "B0058AFS0O", "B00006FDAI", "B00EGIAQ1K", "B000A7G4TY"], "bought_together": ["B00EV1YZ96", "B00G5G7EXY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00EV1YZ96", "B00AFEX83C", "B00I6JOD2S", "B004HO6I4M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7746}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 25.5, "brand": "Disney", "asin": "B00005JM02", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-difUGanL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}

{"description": "There's only one deleted scene in this two-disc DVD set, but it's a doozy. The \"Sgt. Candy Scene\" is a must-see and, unfortunately, the best thing on the second disc. The rushed HBO documentary shows us far more flash than substance. Better is the Visual Effects Lab that goes more in-depth with four sequences, although you need to wade through a hokey interface for each segment. Making your \"own\" effects isn't that much fun; you can only choose a few effects that change in two scenes. Anyone looking to get the complicated backstory of the trilogy figured out should dig into the \"Sky Net Database\" and an intricate timeline. The two commentary tracks are worth a listen, with director Jonathan Mostow's solo track the better one. The director goes into great detail on how the little things (from lighting street scenes to tricks for destroying buildings) count.  The second track is pieced together from the actors recorded separately. Mostow appears with actress Claire Danes (doing her first commentary track) and their chemistry is enjoyable after a slow start. The other actors have less interesting things to say, including Schwarzenegger who is constantly--yet enthusiastically--selling the film.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5", "B001FB55HQ", "B00005JA8B", "B00070FX5U", "B00007AJG4", "B002ZG98LO", "B000T9OP7G", "B002GHHHME", "B00005JKIP", "B002QFYJFY", "B0002J58HO", "B0000AXE8I", "B001AQO43M", "B00AKGG828", "B00026ZG10", "B0001BKAEY", "B00IZZDWKM", "B001451HXO", "B0000VCZK2", "B000056PMU", "B000BPL2FQ", "B000RW3VCK", "B0004Z33F0", "B000U1ZV8K", "B0045HCJGC", "B0004Z33EQ", "B00005JNTU", "B000HRMAPE", "B00008G8M4", "B000RRS7RE", "B00005JKYX", "B0000VD12I", "B000FC2FQA", "B00000ILDG", "B00000G3PA", "B00005JMZK", "B000MGBSE4", "B0087ZG7J8", "B0004Z33EG", "B000P0J0AQ", "B00005JMEW", "B0087ZG7NO", "B00003CXTA", "B0002CHK1S", "B000RJO56E", "B00177YA1K", "B00004STDN", "B005COLETU", "B001AK3S4Y", "B000VNMMR0", "B0000959N0", "B00005JMUA", "1558908846", "6305767866", "B001RIY4WE", "B0049IHX2C", "B000VI70QS", "B000EGDB10", "B002GSXKN8", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B0045HCJ9O", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00005JNJV", "B001451HX4", "B00I9TDMRM", "B0006GANOQ", "B00003CXSP", "6305428115", "B00016MSV2", "B00005JOC9", "B000TJBN80", "B009MO57H6", "B000O77SQS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B001OST0M6", "B005LAIHXQ", "B0002J4X1Q", "B0002V7OI8", "B0015XHP2C", "6304806434", "B000QXDED6", "B00005JL3K", "B008JFUPFI", "B003PIUINS", "0783225946", "0792839056", "B00005N7Z1", "B0006GAO6I", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00005JL78", "B001HN697M", "B00IJS2OXG", "B002NXSRVG", "B00008G8M5", "B00005JN0T", "B003XURDAY", "B000O77SRM", "B006VRRGNK", "B00F4FFO8E"], "bought_together": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5", "B001FB55HQ", "B002JT6AO0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 115564}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.47, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JM0B", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5143TFPX8SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "All on a single disc,The League of Extraordinary Gentlemenoffers two commentary tracks, 12 deleted and extended scenes, and a 54-minute documentary. The track by the two producers and three of the actors is informative, but surprisingly interesting is the track by the film's technicians, particularly costume designer Jacqueline West, whose passion for her craft is infectious.  Unfortunately, the film's two biggest selling points--thegraphic novelthat inspired it and the marquee star, Sean Connery--don't get sufficient attention.  The documentary acknowledges the graphic novel but doesn't really discuss it, concentrating on examinations of the costumes and special effects (e.g., Mr. Hyde was done without CGI).  Connery's involvement consists of a few sound bites at the beginning of some of the documentary chapters.  He and producer Don Murphy explain that he turned downThe Lord of the RingsandThe Matrixbecause he didn't understand them, but even though he wasn't sure he understoodLXG, he wasn't going to turn it down.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002KVUKM", "B0009MDPYM", "B001AK3S4Y", "B001F7MSFM", "B00AEFXCLU", "B002GOAH1A", "B0006IIPIK", "B0000959N0", "6304711891", "B0007P0Y7C", "B003HKN52U", "B000FGGE68", "B003M987PQ", "B006VRRGNK", "B004EPZ07K", "1558908846", "B0002J4X1Q", "B001DHXT20", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B007K3JFUQ", "B008JFUS0U", "B002GHHHL0", "B000OVLBF8", "B00AEFYGBA", "B00005JNTU", "B001OQCV6A", "B000069I1I", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000ENC5YW", "B0006L0LOS", "B000VI70QS", "B00IKM5LXG", "B003Y5H5EW", "0800195175", "B0090SI56Y", "B00005JLQN", "B00070FX5U", "B005LAIH54", "B002A5EBMQ", "B000B8GT92", "B000MX7V70", "B0045HCJGC", "B000ASATYY", "B001CDR1FG", "B001GCUO0W", "B004LWZW42", "B001VLFE7G", "B004SEUIWY", "B003Q6D2B4", "B00004Z4WR", "B009MF5BXK", "B00151QYXU", "B00003CXSD", "B002GSXKNI", "B005LAIGW8", "B002ZG99KO", "B000035Z38", "0767834739", "B00005JN0T", "B002ZG999U", "B00E5I2MEK", "B00E5I2M9K", "B0013FDM7E", "B002ZG97CO", "B0002IQMAM", "B00BTYOYG2", "B008JFURII", "B008JFUO72", "B0013J55B6", "B001HQZJMU", "B000EQHXN2", "B000OVLBHG", "B009MO57H6", "B000AP04FG", "B00008K76U", "B000WC39LI", "6304712499", "B005LAIHYU", "B008JFUPPI", "B0016Q2D5M", "B00006JDVV", "B00111YM5G", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B000I0RQVI", "B000CEXGAU", "B000056PMU", "B001QTXM5Y", "B0000VJG72", "B005LAIH2C", "B00I9TDMRM", "B00005JM5E", "B00008EYA5", "B002ZG99G8", "B00007AJE1", "B000H30B2C", "B002NXSRVG", "B00195FUDC", "B001QB9H1U", "B0006GANOQ", "B001DJLD1M"], "bought_together": ["B0002KVUKM", "B0009MDPYM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002KVUKM", "B00005JLXE", "B001F7MSFM", "B002ZG98LO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12054}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.68, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00005JM5B", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KDD84NPVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (Widescreen Edition)"}

Without adding anything to the running time of the R-rated theatrical cut, the unrated edition substitutes steamier footage into the film Eli watches while talking to Matt, and removes some digitized bikinis in part of the strip-club scene.  (The new cut also has a more threatening scene between Matt and Kelly.)  Don't expect to see more of star Elisha Cuthbert, though; she didn't do any nude scenes, as she explains in one of the five scenes she provides commentary for.  Costar Emile Hirsch does his own commentary for three of the same scenes plus one other, but he's less insightful and more prone to gaps of silence than Cuthbert.

{"description": "The award-winning bestseller comes to life in this phenomenally fun, adventure-filled movie starring Emmy Award-winner Shia LaBeouf (Outstanding Performer In A Children's Series, Disney Channel's EVEN STEVENS, 2000). Dogged by bad luck stemming from an ancient family curse, young Stanley Yelnats (LaBeouf) is sent to Camp Green Lake, a very weird place that's not green and doesn't have a lake.

{"description": "More than a few critics hailedSpider-Man 2as \"the best superhero movie ever,\" and there's no compelling reason to argue--thanks to a bigger budget, better special effects, and a dynamic, character-driven plot, it's a notch aboveSpider-Manin terms of emotional depth and rich comic-book sensibility.Ordinary PeopleOscar-winner Alvin Sargent received screenplay credit, and celebrated author and comic-book expert Michael Chabon worked on the story, but it's director Sam Raimi's affinity for the material that bringsSpidey 2to vivid life. When a fusion experiment goes terribly wrong, a brilliant physicist (Alfred Molina) is turned into Spidey's newest nemesis, the deranged, mechanically tentacled \"Doctor Octopus,\" obsessed with completing his experiment and killing Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) in the process. Even more compelling is Peter Parker's urgent dilemma: continue his burdensome, lonely life of crime-fighting as Spider-Man, or pursue love and happiness with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst)? Molina's outstanding as a tragic villain controlled by his own invention, and the action sequences are nothing less than breathtaking, but the real success ofSpider-Man 2is its sense of priorities. With all of Hollywood's biggest and best toys at his disposal, Raimi and his writers stay true to the Marvel mythology, honoringSpider-Mancreators Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, and setting the bar impressively high for the challenge ofSpider-Man 3.--Jeff ShannonDVD Features:The first commentary track is by director Sam Raimi and a self-deprecating Tobey Maguire speaking in tandem, and producer (and Marvel CEO) Avi Arad and coproducer Grant Curtis speaking in tandem. They discuss a number of topics, including Raimi's memory of his excitement over Richard Donner's Superman and how the character of Black Cat had to be dropped from the film. The second commentary is by six members of the Oscar-nominated effects team, and one of their primary focuses is how Doc Ock's arms were achieved by a combination of puppetry and CGI.The centerpiece of the second disc is a massive two-hour documentary that can be viewed all at once or in 12 separate pieces. It covers the development of the story, the visual effects, costumes, stunts, and sound and music. Three shorter featurettes cover Peter Parker's struggle between his personal and hero lives, Doc Ock, and the women in Spider-Man's life, and what's interesting is how they discuss those topics not just in relation to the movies but to the comic books as well. (For example, Betty Brant and Gwen Stacy had a much greater impact in the comics.) There's a scene in which you can toggle among three different camera angles, and a gallery of 17 paintings Alex Ross created for the opening sequence.

{"description": "Queen Latifah demonstrates her loose, easy charm inLast Holiday, a remake of the 1950 comedy with Alec Guinness. Though at first glance it's hard to imagine anyone less like Alec Guinness than Queen Latifah, they both communicate a world of inner thought with nothing more than a sly sideways glance. Georgia Byrd (Latifah), a department store employee, leads a life of frustrated desires--particularly for a bashful salesman from the outdoor furnishings department (LL Cool J,Deep Blue Sea). But when she learns she only has a few weeks left to live, Georgia gathers her money, quits her job, and flies to a swank European resort she's always dreamed of visiting. Naturally, her new carelessness with money and fearless candor lead everyone around her--including her senator (Giancarlo Esposito,Do The Right Thing) and her former boss (Timothy Hutton,Ordinary People)--to think she's a mover and shaker.Last Holidayunfolds the way you expect it to (dozens of movies and TV shows have similar plots), but Latifah and the capable cast keep it alive. Also featuring Alicia Witt (The Upside of Anger), Jane Adams (Happiness), and the ever-dependable Gerard Depardieu (Cyrano de Bergerac) as a passionate chef.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B000MQC9H4", "B003UEYBPI", "B0009X7BFK", "B000098XQ8", "B0013ERFGE", "B00005JN4H", "B001DJLCQS", "B000FUH35U", "B000YAF4Q6", "B007HHWJSA", "B00005JLON", "B000R17RQM", "B003L16FCC", "B001EZE5DS", "B003Y5H58S", "B000065V3J", "B005LAIH86", "B00AEFXY6I", "B000FS9ULC", "B00006RVJR", "B00177YFYM", "B000957O82", "B000093I8L", "B000803BQC", "B00066FAQW", "B000OCZA04", "B001WLMONM", "B00066FAC6", "B00005LB86", "B0014QLEI6", "B001NLJ3NU", "B00164KYV4", "B00BNV9WCW", "B000YGGNMO", "B001QUF7DS", "B0009RCPUW", "B00066FAVW", "B00003CXSM", "B000F3UA5M", "B00004Y2R1", "B000LW7REE", "0783240201", "B0009OL7Z4", "B002K0WBXW", "B004SIP9RO", "B00097DXFS", "B002ZG99RW", "B000CEV3KU", "B0018RNF60", "B00AEFXTKO", "B002CA68NO", "B0000VD02Y", "B001CTA1UM", "0780627822", "B000A343RI", "B004SIP9VA", "B0001Q4BOE", "B00005JPSM", "B0088RMEII", "B00008WJD6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000MQC9H4", "B003UEYBPI", "B005LAIH86", "B0009X7BFK"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JOSG", "imUrl": "http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-site/icons/no-img-sm._CB192198896_.gif", "title": "Last Holiday"}

{"description": "This two-disc collector's edition ofPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chestis packed with over five hours of special features that delve into everything from creating the mythology-inspired Davy Jones and Kraken figures, to working and planning without a completed script, the incredible CGI techniques used in the film, the intense sword training sessions and stunt work, and the unpredictability of filming on location in the Caribbean. The audio commentary by writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio is an interesting and insightful look into the finished film, but perhaps even more revealing is the 25-minute \"Charting the Return\" preproduction diary in which everyone from producer Jerry Bruckheimer to associate director Peter Kohn and writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio give a sense of the enormity of the project of concurrently writing and filming two sequels toPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. The overwhelming logistics of planning and casting without a finished script, scouting and preparing remote locations, constructing a new Black Pearl, and functional props like the rolling water wheel, and cutting costs to stay within budget are nothing less than mind-boggling. In the hourlong \"According to Plan\" feature, director Gore Verbinski, producer Jerry Bruckheimer, and a host of others detail the enormity of the project, focusing on the stamina involved in a 200-day shooting schedule and the need for adaptability and flexibility in dealing with everything from behind schedule excavations to the logistics of shooting on moving water and even the natural fury of a full-blown hurricane.  Shorter featurettes \"Meet Davy Jones: Anatomy of a Legend\" and \"Creating the Kraken\" focus on the mythological creatures in the film and the awesome visual effects and advances in CGI technology that made them possible.  \"Mastering the Blade\" follows Orlando Bloom (Will Turner), Keira Knightley (Elizabeth Swann), and Jack Davenport (Norrington) through some intense sword-fighting training sessions and \"Fly on the Set: The Bone Cage\" offers a frightening look at what it was like to shoot the bone cage scene of the movie.  Other bonus features include bloopers, an interactive tour of Johnny Depp's special makeup effects and wardrobe details, a look at how the 1967 Disney Land Pirates of the Caribbean ride was recently \"re-imagineered\" to incorporate some of the characters and elements from the new movies, producer Jerry Bruckheimer's photo diary, and a glimpse of the glitzy June 24, 2006 red carpet premiere on Disney Land's main street.--Tami Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JM5E", "B005COPWZW", "B004A8ZWUQ", "B0013BM63O", "B00005JN5E", "B004M1A21K", "B004DTLK80", "B000VR0570", "B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY", "B00005JKCH", "B001HN694K", "B00005JPH2", "B00AEFYGBA", "B00BEZTMFY", "B001HQZJMU", "B00E5I2M6I", "B006VRRGNK", "B001BEK8HO", "B000E8M0VA", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B001E75QH0", "B008QE9XD2", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00LG6YEKE", "B00AEBBA72", "B007K3JFUQ", "B000HRMAPE", "B0090SI56Y", "B000E6EK2Y", "B0053FANRC", "B00005JMQW", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B00177YA1K", "B001TK80C0", "B000UR9T8C", "B00003CXI1", "B004EPYZUS", "B00003CXTA", "B001OQCV6A", "B0014Z4ON4", "B005G4TJUC", "B000F7CECK", "B00HFFE8HE", "B001GCUO1Q", "B0087ZG7J8", "B003YAR97K", "B008JFUNTG", "B001GCUO0W", "B000NIBURQ", "B0053FANPY", "B00023B1LC", "B003QO8TOQ", "B002VPE1BQ", "B00F84H73Q", "B003Y5H54W", "B00003CWT6", "B00007AJGH", "B00E5I2M9K", "B000W7F5SS", "B0049IHX2C", "B00000IRE6", "B001F7MSFM", "B000AYELVA", "B002ZG9904", "B000VWYJ86", "B00CFA222M", "B003UYUQZW", "B008UZ949K", "B0002KVUKM", "B000209KMW", "B000UVKGPI", "B0087ZG7HK", "B0000WN140", "B001EZE5BU", "B002PMV9FG", "B000HT386M", "B000NQRR1Q", "B00003CXZ1", "630529142X", "B0002ZDVEU", "B004A8ZWSS", "B00005JM5B", "B000BTITKS", "B00E5I2MEK", "B002HWRYJE", "B001GZ6QC4", "B000W796OM", "B00AQSN7HE", "B0046BI81W", "B001VLBDD0", "B0060FXDCG", "B0084IG8TM", "B005OCFGTO", "B000OLGCIE", "B008JFUS0U", "B00007AJG4", "B009JBWOU0", "B001B3LIOC"], "bought_together": ["B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JM5E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005COPWZW", "B00005JM5E", "B0071JADFU", "B00005JPFX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 72898}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 16.95, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JP0F", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GQE7TQ72L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}

{"description": "Edith Piaf is the subject ofLa Vie en Rose, director Olivier Dahan's powerful if emotionally redundant biographical film about the iconic French superstar whose life, as depicted here, seems to have been a numbing succession of tragedies interrupted on occasion by artistic triumph. Dahan's portrait begins with Piaf's stay in a brothel as a young girl. Left to the care of her grandmother (who runs the place) after her father pulls her away from a narcissistic mother, Piaf undergoes significant health problems and grows up to sing on the street in lieu of outright prostitution. The film pulses along with the usual biopic rhythms, with pivotal moments in the life of Piaf (played as an adult by Marion Cotillard) turning up regularly only to be smacked aside by the unseen hand of perpetual misfortune. There's the impresario (Gerard Depardieu) who recognizes Piaf's great but raw talent only to have a run-in with the criminal element around her. There's the heavyweight fighter (Marcel Cerdan) who becomes the love of Piaf's life but can't be with her. Drug addiction, random car accidents, tax problems, you name it, it's all here, topped by an unnerving revelation that pops up inLa Vie en Rose's final moments. After awhile, with such a concentration of bad news squeezed into 140 minutes, one begins to wish Dahan had taken a more expansive approach to Piaf's life and times. But the film is never less than interesting, and the lead performance by Cotillard is often astonishing.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002LE8MGW", "B004SEUIXS", "B000UVV26A", "B001CIOCLC", "B000002UYD", "B002VKB0M4", "B000YPUFBA", "B002AG2NTI", "B0007Z0NYQ", "B0087IT8FK", "B000MEYIBG", "B0009P7EI2", "B004WDZR0O", "B00279MJHE", "0307268012", "B0069UV0AY", "B001THZAAI", "B005MYEQ4U", "B000002TMF", "B000LXH10I", "B00421IR5I", "B0000C9JFO", "B007I1Q59E", "B00AZNEVNE", "B000I6BJ56", "B000811672", "B00007J5VT", "B008H1Q3QY", "B0002S64SM", "B003L20III", "B00782O7IY", "1613743920", "B005V4X8PO", "B0007A61K6", "B0030MD5TS", "B0019UGYAU", "B0000YEENU", "B0084O26SI", "B004B3254Q", "B0001Y4JO8", "B004ZBFRRG", "B006KDHJMS", "B00A92MEJY", "B000UAE7MM", "B009CSVQ8Q", "B000SAAT76", "B00008979K", "B000CSUNRU", "B000YAA68W", "B004SIP6BI", "B0041KKYF6", "B002QQ8HAG", "B00005JM48", "B00007L4I6", "B000934FC2", "B005CKW8BM", "B004YCKKIM", "B002ONC9NC", "B001AZJKKK", "B0012EI8ES", "B009B8YMB0", "B000053VBN", "B0002V7TI8", "B004UXUUDA", "B008CJ0JS4", "B001DZA3W6", "B0031REQKE", "B000LXHK2C", "B005HISOJ4", "B000B58DHQ", "B000296E7W", "0792833279", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B005CU5OF4", "B0000A1HQP", "B00ENMZK1A", "B00166UFTS", "B000053VBP", "B00CDV4PPK", "B00005AUK9", "B004XVMCMG", "B00005NC66", "B00008G7UF", "B0031SU2Y2", "B00000AVEO", "B000M06KJ8", "B00ANQHR7U", "B004NWPY3E", "B001C71IEM", "B006OB3JVQ", "B00G15MDI0", "B001KVZ6AM", "B0036TGSJE", "B001O549EI", "B0045NXMJE", "B000SSQ7JC", "B004ZG5EYC", "B00000K3TS"], "bought_together": ["B002LE8MGW", "B001CIOCLC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005MYEQ4U", "B002LE8MGW", "B004SEUIXS", "B000UVV26A"]}, "price": 11.14, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9014}, "asin": "B00005JPX8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ylggkac7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "La Vie en Rose (Extended Version)"}
{"description": "Leonardo DiCaprio puts a handsome face on an ugly industry: In parts of Africa, diamond mining fuels civil warfare, killing thousands of innocents and drafting preteen children as vicious soldiers. DiCaprio (The Departed) plays Danny Archer, a white African soldier-turned-diamond-smuggler who gets wind of a large raw jewel found by Solomon Vandy, a native fisherman (Djimon Hounsou,In America) recently escaped from enslavement by a brutal rebel leader. Archer offers a deal: He'll help Vandy find his war-scattered family if Vandy will share the diamond with him. Drawn into this web of exploitation is journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly,Little Children), who agrees to help if Archer will tell her the details of how conflict diamonds make their way into the hands of the corporations who sell them to the Western world. DiCaprio is compelling because he never flinches from Archer's utter ruthlessness; Archer ends up doing the morally justifiable thing, but only because his desperate greed has led him to it. Hounsou and Connelly, though saddled with all the moral and political speeches, rise above the cant and keep the movie's treacherously formulaic plot rooted in human characters. But in the end, the story won't stick with you as much as the dead stillness in the child soldiers' eyes; the horror of African civil strife refuses to be contained byBlood Diamond's uplifting message--and the movie is all the more potent as a result.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001N44BVQ", "B000M341QE", "B00005JLSB", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00080ZG10", "B004SIP7TE", "B006OFN0SE", "B002ZG980U", "B000NIVJF4", "B0007R4T3U", "B0016Q2D66", "B00049QQHI", "B001EZE5DI", "B00003CWM3", "B00008DP4C", "6305268827", "B000BYA5G4", "B00AEBB9F0", "B000Y7WGOW", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000065U1N", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000095WW8", "B000U7169M", "B00DHHWXYY", "B000GFLKF8", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002O3Z510", "B002VWNIEA", "B002ZG99N6", "B0007DFJ0G", "B005LAIIJY", "0792839137", "B000KP62SE", "B000P0J0EW", "B000P0J09M", "B007SPPANM", "B00004XPPG", "B000C20VPA", "B00011CZRE", "B002QEHPQU", "B00005JN2Z", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00003CXWV", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00001ZWUS", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00005JN0W", "B002T9H2LA", "B000MTEFXC", "B003L20IG0", "B00AEBB86A", "B00005JKBC", "B0013XZ2QK", "B0000ACOXL", "B005LAIGRS", "B002AT8K9W", "B0007KIFGE", "B00AZNEW5G", "B003ASLJO0", "B000T28PII", "B002DU39GW", "B002ZG97RE", "B000LC55F2", "B00003CXTG", "B00AEBBA36", "B00B0U2SFE", "B003ASLJQI", "B002CPMB9O", "B00BB67UNW", "B000MXPE7O", "0783231202", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00AEFXVCU", "B00AEFXRRO", "B000A3XY5A", "B002JCSWV6", "B00005JNQA", "B004EPYZP8", "B0050MB4OO", "B000P0J0AG", "B000C65Z1G", "B00275EGWY", "B00005B6JZ", "B0006GANPA", "B00AEBB9NM", "B002XMGGK6", "B000C20VRS", "B0007P0XBO", "B003UESJME", "B000QXDED6", "B00AHTYI5M", "B001P9KR8U", "B004A8ZX28", "B008JFUNKU", "B003ASLJQS", "B002VWNICC", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00005BCKF", "B000NOIX48"], "bought_together": ["B000M341QE", "B002ZG980U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBB8NI", "B00H9KKGTO", "B008MILL8W", "B000BYA5G4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 106777}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.96, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JPGO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61MN8-6skUL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blood Diamond (Two-Disc Special Edition)"}

{"description": "\"I bought a car. Turned out to be an alien robot. Who knew?\" deadpans Sam Witwicky, hero and human heart of Michael Bay's rollicking robot-smackdown fest,Transformers. Witwicky (the sweetly nerdy Shia LaBeouf, channeling a young John Cusack) is the perfect counterpoint to the nearly nonstop exhilarating action. The plot is simple: an alien civil war (the Autobots vs. the evil Decepticons) has spilled onto Earth, and young Sam is caught in the fray by his newly purchased souped-up Camaro. Which has a mind--and identity, as a noble-warrior robot named Bumblebee--of its own. The effects, especially the mind-blowing transformations of the robots into their earthly forms and back again, are stellar.Fans of the earlier film and TV series will be thrilled at this cutting-edge incarnation, but this version should please all fans of high-adrenaline action. Director Bay gleefully salts the movie with homages to pop-culture touchstones likeRaiders of the Lost Ark,King Kong, and the early technothrillerWarGames. The actors, though clearly all supporting those kickass robots, are uniformly on-target, including the dashing Josh Duhamel as a U.S. Army sergeant fighting an enemy he never anticipated; Jon Voight, as a tough yet sympathetic Secretary of Defense in over his head; and John Turturro, whose special agent manages to be confidently unctuous, even stripped to his undies. But the film belongs to Bumblebee, Optimus Prime, and the dastardly Megatron--and the wicked stunts they collide in all over the globe. Long live Transformers! --A.T. HurleyOn the DVDThe special edition ofTransformersis packed with extras (and more than a few product placements for Hasbro). The entire second disc is devoted to featurettes on aspects of making the technical tour-de-force--and the land mines involved in tinkering with a beloved '80s franchise. Executive producer Steven Spielberg is very much a part of the proceedings, from his introductory comments (\"I think everybody likes the idea of taking something you're familiar with and turning it into something you're not so familiar with--like an 18-wheeler become Optimus Prime\") to mentions of his films that influenced this one, likeE.T.andClose Encounters of the Third Kind.Director Michael Bay is brash and entertaining as he talks about his initial reluctance to take on the project, his indoctrination at \"Transformers U\" at Hasbro, and his enthusiasm for guerrilla-style action filmmaking. Star Shia LaBoeuf says, \"He is the sickest action director\" out there, and there's plenty of evidence here to support that. Other great highlights include features on how key scenes were shot, including the heart-pounding desert battle and the shootout in the streets of downtown L.A.--adrenaline-pumping stuff, even without the Transformers CGI'd in. --A.T.

{"description": "Here's hoping James Mangold's big, raucous, and ultrabloody remake of3:10 to Yumaleads some moviegoers to check outDelmer Daves's beautifully lean, half-century-old original. That classic Western spun a tale of captured outlaw Ben Wade (Glenn Ford)--deadly but disarmingly affable--and the small-time rancher and family man, Dan Evans (Van Heflin), desperate enough to accept the job of helping escort the badman to Yuma prison. Wade, knowing that his gang will be along at any moment to spring him, works at persuading the ultimately lone deputy to accept a bribe, turn his back on \"duty,\" and go home safe and rich to his family. That the outlaw has come to admire his captor intriguingly complicates the suspense.All of the above applies in the new3:10, but it takes a lot more huffing and puffing to get Wade (Russell Crowe this time) and Evans (Christian Bale) into position for the showdown. Mostly, more is less. To Mangold's credit, his movie doesn't traffic in facile irony or postmodern detachment; it aims to be a straight-up Western and deliver the excitement and charisma the genre's fans are starved for. But recognizing that contemporary viewers might be out of touch with the bedrock simplicity and strength of the genre--not to mention its code of honor--Mangold has supplied both Evans and Wade with a plethora of backstory and \"motivations.\" At the overblown action climax, the crossfire of personal agendas is almost as frenetic as the copious gunplay. (By that point the movie has killed more people than the Lincoln County War.)Best thing about the remake is Russell Crowe's Ben Wade, a Scripture-quoting career villain with an artist's eye and a curiously principled sense of whom and when to murder. As his second-in-command, Ben Foster fairly pirouettes at every opportunity to commit mayhem, and Peter Fonda contributes a fierce portrait of an old Wade adversary turned bounty hunter for the Pinkerton detective agency.--Richard T.

{"description": "The Dark Knightarrives with tremendous hype (best superhero movie ever? posthumous Oscar for Heath Ledger?), and incredibly, it lives up to all of it.  But calling it the best superhero movie ever seems like faint praise, since part of what makes the movie great--in addition to pitch-perfect casting, outstanding writing, and a compelling vision--is that it bypasses the normal fantasy element of the superhero genre and makes it all terrifyingly real.  Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is Gotham City's new district attorney, charged with cleaning up the crime rings that have paralyzed the city. He enters an uneasy alliance with the young police lieutenant, Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), and Batman (Christian Bale), the caped vigilante who seems to trust only Gordon--and whom only Gordon seems to trust. They make progress until a psychotic and deadly new player enters the game: the Joker (Heath Ledger), who offers the crime bosses a solution--kill the Batman. Further complicating matters is that Dent is now dating Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, after Katie Holmes turned down the chance to reprise her role), the longtime love of Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne.In his last completed role before his tragic death, Ledger is fantastic as the Joker, a volcanic, truly frightening force of evil. And he sets the tone of the movie: the world is a dark, dangerous place where there are no easy choices.  Eckhart and Oldman also shine, but as good as Bale is, his character turns out rather bland in comparison (not uncommon for heroes facing more colorful villains). Director-cowriter Christopher Nolan (Memento) follows his critically acclaimedBatman Beginswith an even better sequel that sets itself apart from notable superhero movies likeSpider-Man 2andIron Manbecause of its sheer emotional impact and striking sense of realism--there are no suspension-of-disbelief superpowers here. At 152 minutes, it's a shade too long, and it's much too intense for kids. But for most movie fans--and not just superhero fans--The Dark Knightis a film for the ages.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B000PC6A3E", "B002ZG981E", "B00G4RD4PQ", "B0039208QM", "B001GMALGY", "B00E2Y0YBK", "B00C2IGQBA", "B0039208JE", "B00H14WTLQ", "B0039208CG", "B0085D3I3K", "B0039208C6", "B000M5AJQI", "B00319ECGK", "B001FB55H6", "B00EIG5M5A", "7020070078", "B00E2Y6AUY", "B00D5FMGGS", "B001OQCV6K", "B0013FBS20", "B000Q6GX5Y", "B001GKJ2FC", "B00FPS79F6", "B001992NUQ", "B004JMSIRC", "B001RIY4WE", "B00DYEN6XC", "B008QZ5PY2", "B001F7MSG6", "B00FAHYNWE", "B00J7PRJXU", "B001AQT0Z4", "B001UV4XEW", "B0083SBJXS", "B00AEFY552", "B00C8RD79O", "B007KAJG3K", "B007L4HET8", "B004EPZ07U", "B007L4HFDI", "B00AEFXKOO", "B000PC0U1W", "B00C6B8TB8", "B00HINFI4K", "B003TT2X6I", "B001KZIRM2", "B002ZG99NG", "B00EZ4M68G", "B004SIP90G", "B003ZHR6RK", "B001GCUO16", "B003TT2X6S", "B00JNEWSLS", "B001F3FUK6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B002ZG981E", "B000PC6A3E"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPY0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pGxSkkz4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Dark Knight [Theatrical Release]"}
{"description": "The long road toPollockbegan when actor Ed Harris received a biography of Jackson Pollock from his father, who noticed that his son bore an uncanny resemblance to the artist. Harris's fascination with Pollock matched his physical similarity; the actor chose to direct and star in this impressive film biography. And his devotion assured a work of singular integrity, honoring the artist's achievement in abstract expressionism while acknowledging that Pollock was a tormented, manic-depressive alcoholic whose death at 44 (in a possibly suicidal car crash) also claimed the life of an innocent woman. The film also suggests that Pollock's success was largely attributable to the devotion of his wife, artist Lee Krasner, played with matching ferocity by Marcia Gay Harden in an Oscar&reg;-winning performance.In many respects a traditional biopic,Pollockbegins in 1941 when Pollock meets Krasner, who encourages him and attracts the attention of supportive critic Clement Greenberg (Jeffrey Tambor) and benefactor Peggy Guggenheim (Amy Madigan). As Pollock rises from obscurity to international acclaim, Harris brings careful balance to his portrayal of a driven creator who found peace during those brief, sober periods when art brought release from his tenacious inner demons. The film offers sympathy without sentiment, appreciation without misguided hagiography. As an acting showcase it's utterly captivating. As a compassionate but unflinching exploration of Jackson Pollock's intimate world, there's no doubt that Harris captured the essence of a man whose life was as torturous as his art was redeeming.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0030T120A", "B005TTEG3O", "B004SIP7S0", "B003ODIV10", "B000BYA4HY", "B0041I97CO", "B00116GEJ8", "B001CK7OM4", "B001CK7OLU", "B000WZAE7W", "B0043CT8GI", "B000AL72R8", "B000NVI0EY", "B002ZMZBIM", "B0001US61O", "B0051URXWM", "B003WKQ46E", "B0026BTRUK", "B003VTKZ8O", "B003MWHUMY", "B000CCCZYA", "0810984962", "B0009X7BHI", "B000GEIREQ", "B0006GANX2", "B000092T3B", "B001O7R768", "B008BWFP18", "B000053VBM", "B000IHYXK8", "B00470MG06", "B000YKYT2G", "B00EV1YZKK", "B004U7MR1Y", "B003ELMR8U", "B009B8YZ8U", "B001BWYT4E", "B000055XMV", "B003BR8MDQ", "0913391190", "3836512769", "B0031REQKE", "B000NO1XG8", "B000H6SXSI", "B002RB56WM", "B0064MT1SA", "B00HQF9UPI", "B00005AUKF", "B000E3LCXW", "B000QGDXG6", "B00BQXTDEO", "B003ELMR80", "B000KN7C1W", "B0011IR2R4", "B0077PBPNM", "B005DNDUEW", "B004CJQVQC", "B0007PALGG", "B003JHXS1E", "B0087HDEGA", "B0056G1ARU", "B000053VAV", "B0000TPAQA", "B000E3LCXC", "0226074064", "3822821357", "0060973676", "B0064MT1FI", "B002LC3M8M", "B004CYVZ5E", "6304712936", "B001P3SA8K", "B00003CXPV", "B000FFJYCK", "0780619587", "B00004STD8", "B004XVMCNK", "B003L16F5Y", "B000E33VWW", "B0011NVC8Y", "B004SUDQ8G", "B00B5EC9BI", "B0041I97C4", "B005J4TLQ6", "B0041KKYEM", "B0043CT8GS", "B0009U6XD4", "B0011FLH14", "B00005UQ7S", "B0002JL9N6", "B00003CWN3", "B00GUO2SKA", "B002SF9YUM", "B0006A9I2U", "0792845803", "B000063N9O", "B00441GZ00", "B00CBFB8SU", "0815410093"], "bought_together": ["B004SIP7S0", "B0030T120A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004SIP7S0", "B0030T120A", "B000BYA4HY", "B0006GANX2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 16504}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.99, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00005KHJJ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P6XQX68ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pollock (Special Edition)"}

Baker and star Jim Carrey are such interesting personalities that their stories about the time-consuming process are entertaining. For the kids, Max's Playhouse has some simple games and three sing-alongs. How interesting you find the rest of the extras will depend on how much you liked the film.

{"description": "John Frankenheimer updates the mutant-monster films of the 1950s with a modern environmental twist in this well-meaning but clich&eacute;-ridden late-'70s horror film. Robert Foxworth is so earnest it hurts as a rabble-rousing ghetto doctor who packs up his pregnant wife (Talia Shire) and heads out to the Maine woods to investigate claims of environmental pollution. That's the least of his concerns when a gooey mutant grizzly goes on the rampage and he joins forces with Native American activist Armand Assante (wearing his humorless resolve like war paint) to get out of the woods. Frankenheimer is a good director saddled with a bad, blunt script, and like a pro he delivers the requisite gore and even racks up the tension in a terrific opening chase. But even he can't overcome the clumsiest collection of deformed woodland creatures to claw their way through a monster movie.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00KUCR3LC", "B00IYJRIKO", "B00AEFYSR2", "B000RO9PV4", "B0007R4TR6", "B000CSTKGA", "B000G296X4", "B00HRUQB8Q", "B002NN7EY2", "B00I099JO6", "1606730266", "B000JU8H56", "B0002C9DK4", "B000HT38B2", "B004CZZZEK", "B0002I838G", "B00IA1VKVY", "B000FFJZO2", "B00153ZR8G", "B005ETANC2", "B00K8EVSVI", "B005OT80W2", "6305943133", "B004TPJNAA", "B004S8UTII", "B00AEBB8VK", "B000FGFBUS", "B00005JP4N", "B00HFWETZ8", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B004GF3IJU", "B000A2XA78", "B00BTYXNQE", "B000AQKU72", "B008XTVWHK", "B00005KH30", "B008UFUL6K", "B000HXDWNM", "B001AR0D6I", "B00J81S92S", "B000TUDBFC", "B00I462XF2", "B00IQAUO2A", "0792846885", "B00005LIRD"], "bought_together": ["B00KUCR3LC", "B00AEFYSR2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BTYXNQE", "B00AEFYSR2", "B004CZZZEK", "0792846885"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 41472}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 16.75, "brand": "SHIRE/FOXWORTH/ASSANTE", "asin": "B00005RDAI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41-Bsq6Mz6L.jpg", "title": "Prophecy: The Monster Movie"}
{"description": "\"I am invincible! No one can survive my shadow skills! With a single stroke I am unbeatable!\" In a world where martial arts gladiators with unheard-of skills battle for glory and justice, young orphan Gau trains relentlessly under his cocky adoptive sister Ella (a great champion) to master the elusive Shadow Skill, a mystical style with a dark past. His education of course allows for plenty of flashy fights, and that's the main appeal of this lively collection of two short 1996 OVA features. The animation is limited but the art direction is detailed and vivid, and director Hiroshi Negishi saves his budget for the battles, which offer impressive displays of animation pyrotechnics. Though hardly deep (\"We can get closer to God by fighting!\" opines the mysterious champion Scarface), the episodic adventures zip right along, and the climax packs an unexpected charge of drama between the blows.

Rick (Jason London fromDazed and Confused), who hopes to run Bull Mountain, can't forget about Anna, the French girl he romanced while vacationing in Mexico. When a ruthless developer (Lee Majors, star ofThe Six Million Dollar Man) wants to turn the rough-and-tumble site into a sleek, tourist-friendly resort named Snownook, Rick discovers that Anna is the developer's daughter. Will he be seduced to the dark side by love and ambition? Alongside scenes \"borrowed\" fromCasablanca, there's an abundance of high jinks with Rick's slacker snow buddies, cute girls (includingPlaymate of the YearVictoria Silvstedt), and some pretty amazing snowboarding sequences. Dumb but good-natured fun, and Majors clearly enjoys himself as the bad guy.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EMGJAO", "B000JJ4DNW", "B0000WN1PO", "0783230338", "B0002V7TMY", "B0062MDNEK", "B00363WGBO", "B00AEFZ7F4", "B002ZG97XI", "B000IZJZIU", "B00AEFYSL8", "B00AEFXVW0", "B00005JKMN", "B00005KA6V", "B000CPH9PM", "B00009OWJU", "B0023TCWE8", "B00AEFYS2M", "0790751445", "B000M9CB4W", "B00008L3W3", "B001OD4S50", "B000PMGS6S", "6305433925", "B00AEFY854", "B00AEFYZCU", "B00AEFZ3XU", "B00BLN4V0A", "B000LC3ICE", "B00005JMX6", "B00005V9HR", "B000089778", "B00260HH1W", "B00860YIJU", "B000069CF0", "B00008L3T3", "B00003CWUX", "B00AEBB9UU", "B000BKJ758", "B000RGX0DQ", "B0051MKNRC", "B000063RQO", "B00029RTAI", "B004I9SJH0", "B00AEBB8GA", "B0016MJ6GA", "B000VXWX7E", "B008R65XTC", "B00003GPFT", "6305428387", "6305428549", "B0026BXHQ0", "B0012IWNZY", "B00441GYVA", "B001J9KJ4I", "B000031EFY", "6305161860", "B0010VDYLK", "B007P9HW3M", "B000BO0LOU", "6305428492", "B00E1HIXFW", "B002M36R1Y", "B00AEFYPXY", "B00006AUHQ", "B004ZJZQ6U", "B001G5T6GW", "0783229526", "B003SLEDG0", "B00003CXPS", "B000065K5H", "B00000F0AD", "B00193F30E", "1573625574", "B000FBNG1O", "B001FU793A", "B000Y7U94G", "B0054WPWNY", "B000I0RNVQ", "B004GTVU6O", "B000J4P9P8", "B00AEFY7YQ", "B00006HAYO", "B00AEFXESQ", "B002NZK5Q4", "B00389JERU", "B000A7DVR2", "B008R65XUQ", "B00005RIKM", "B001NPD9PY", "B004FOPFGG", "B0001WTVHA", "B00AEFXJS6", "B004SIP8ES", "B00FOHHMWI", "B0068FZ0O2", "B002O3Z4XY", "B0071HPOJW", "079284646X", "B00005U8QN"], "bought_together": ["B000EMGJAO", "B000JJ4DNW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002ZG97XI", "B000EMGJAO", "B000JJ4DNW", "B00363WGBO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 111542}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 40.0, "brand": "", "asin": "B0000633TZ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514KDFZMXWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Out Cold"}
{"description": "At the heart of the first years of Joss Whedon'sBuffy the Vampire Slayerwas the romance between Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar), slayer of all things evil, and hunky Angel (David Boreanaz), the tortured vampire destined to walk the earth with a soul. The second season ofBuffytook the Buffy-Angelpas de deuxfrom ecstasy to agony in a now-classic plot arc that catapulted the show from WB teen drama to true TV greatness. You see, if the cursed Angel ever experiences true happiness for a moment, he'll revert to being an evil vampire again. And guess what happens after Buffy and Angel finally declare their love for one another and consummate their relationship...Buffyfound its true momentum during the second season, as geeky Xander (Nicholas Brendon) fell in love with popular girl Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter), Willow (Alyson Hannigan) gave up her crush on Xander in favor of werewolf boy Oz (Seth Green), and watcher Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) began a sweetly tentative relationship with computer teacher (and witch) Jenny Calendar (Robia LaMorte). Mayhem came to Sunnydale, though, in the form of evil vampires Drusilla (Juliet Landau) and Spike (drolly wicked James Marsters), who were more than ready to aid and abet Angel as he turned bad. It all sounds like horror-action mayhem (and there are great fight scenes), butBuffytook on its plotlines with amazing depth, intelligence, and humor. And oh, man, the love story! Buffy and Angel's tragic relationship is one of the most heartbreaking you'll ever find. Buffy's final dilemma finds her having to save the world at Angel's expense, and Gellar (who deserves a passel of Emmys for her work) is phenomenal at telegraphing Buffy's swirling conflicts between love and duty. This is some of the best TV ever made, period.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EHSVKK", "B000EHSVLE", "B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVM8", "B000EHSVMS", "B000EHSVN2", "B000I0QLQY", "B000I0QLR8", "B000I0QLRS", "B000I0QLRI", "B000I0QLS2", "B003YF9Q08", "B0009W5J4Q", "B0006IUE16", "B000HD1482", "B000B5XOW0", "B007H9CNOI", "B00466H3CW", "B000ERVJM2", "B000CCBCGM", "B00344EAQO", "B005CM1IIE", "B000GG4Y6O", "1593078226", "B00006J3WH", "1595821651", "B006LG74Q0", "B000JLTRIG", "B00JF5G8WU", "B000OIOPHC", "B0000AQS0F", "B00133QNS6", "1442412097", "B000GG4Y28", "067103541X", "159307963X", "B00001R3O1", "B000BOH986", "B0024FAD8I", "B00133QNSG", "B002U8XW9Q", "0789326302", "B00AMDA2QC", "B00022FWEU", "B003L77GAQ", "B000FL7CAK", "B000QDLSR0", "B00005JLKB", "B00009MEJT", "B009LDCXNY", "1595826106", "B00BBXSPES", "B00006LPCK", "B005GP7ELM", "B000NOKFH6", "1595825584", "B000CNE0SS", "B000KLQUMG", "B0001JXPPC", "B000R9YLKY", "B003L77GWE", "B000BOH98G", "B000F8O2OM", "B0024FAR66", "B000EXDS3E", "B000EXDS3Y", "B000E5KQM8", "B000CNE0TC", "B00006FD9N", "B0017MO11O", "B000667HBS", "B000AJJNFE", "B0000CABIJ", "B00GNAO70K", "B002JVWR4U", "B009LDCWWG", "B00005V6BG", "B0092Q82LC", "B002U0KHME", "B00EIL7E9C", "B003R4ZMN6", "B00242KD1S", "B000LV6VYW", "B00018D42W", "B0048FUUAI", "B000095ZGW", "B00A8KJN8M", "B000V6LSNQ", "B00K0D9760", "B001ILFUA0", "B0024FAD9C", "1593078854", "B000FIMG4U", "B000EBGFPY", "B00079FUI6", "B000062XFG", "B00511N79O", "B0002KVUKM", "B00IKM5LXG", "B002GP7ZVY"], "bought_together": ["B000EHSVKK", "B000EHSVLE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EHSVKK", "B0046XG48O", "B000EHSVN2", "B000EHSVMS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 155101}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 38.99, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B000063IOT", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511DHF4ZPGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Second Season"}
{"description": "\"So,\" Tony Soprano asks analyst Dr. Melfi in the wake of  not-so-dearly-departed Livia's death, \"we're probably done here, right?\" Sorry, Tone, not by a  long shot. Unresolved mother issues are the least of the Family man's troubles  in the brutal and controversial third season ofThe Sopranos. Ranked byTV Guideamong the top five greatest series ever,The Sopranosjustified its eleven-month hiatus with some of its best, and most hotly debated,  episodes that continue the saga of the New Jersey mob boss juggling the  pressures of his often intersecting personal and professional lives. The third  season garnered 22 Emmy nominations, earning Lead Actor and Actress honors for  James Gandolfini and Edie Falco for their now-signature roles as Tony and his  increasingly conflicted wife, Carmela.The Sopranoscontinued to upend convention and defy audience expectations  with a deliberately paced, calm-before-the-storm season opener that revolves  around the FBI's attempts to bug the Soprano household, and a season finale that  (for some) frustratingly leaves several plot lines unresolved. The second  episode, \"Proshai, Livushka,\" confronts the death of the venerable Nancy  Marchand, who capped her career with perhaps her greatest role as malignant  matriarch Livia. A jarring scene between Tony and Livia that uses pre-existing  footage is a distraction, but Carmela's unsparing smackdown of Livia at the wake  redeems the episode. \"Employee of the Month,\" in which Dr. Melfi is raped and  considers whether to exact revenge by telling Tony of her attack, earned Emmys  for its writers, and is perhaps Emmy nominee Lorraine Bracco's finest hour. The  darkly comic \"Pine Barrens\"--another memorable episode, directed by Steve  Buscemi--strands Paulie (Tony Sirico) and Christopher (Michael Imperioli) in the  forest with a runaway corpse. Other story arcs concern the rise of the seriously  unstable Ralph Cifaretto (Joe Pantoliano) and Tony's affair with \"full-blown  loop-de-loo\" Gloria (Emmy nominee Annabella Sciorra). Plus, there is Tony's  estrangement from daughter Meadow (Jamie Lynn Sigler), his wayward delinquent  son Anthony, Jr. (Robert Iler), Carmela's crisis of conscience, bad seed Jackie  Jr., and the FBI--which, as the season ends, assigns an undercover agent to  befriend an unwitting figure in the Soprano family's orbit. Stay tuned for  season four.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008PW1F", "B00005NOHO", "B0007YMVWO", "B000BO7DWI", "B00003CXOP", "B000NA1VI2", "B00BI9WT92", "B000V5A4DM", "B000L43AMU", "B0028RXXFM", "B00BI9VRYK", "0446530573", "B00003A9MG", "B000EULSR0", "B001OQCVFG", "B0000Y40PW", "B00031TYBC", "B009LDD54K", "B005LAJ1H2", "B0009GV9E6", "B002ZCY8CC", "B00EEDNR9A", "B000FTCLSU", "B000C20VPA", "B008LCRA98", "B00BUUAV08", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B00CG4XKNM", "B0002WZTLQ", "B008LCRAFC", "B009TE9HAW", "B00BGI05Y6", "B003L77GS8", "B003Y5HWJU", "B000G1R4TS", "B002BWOYKC", "B0007QS324", "B00005JN8P", "B0027HOBM2", "B00000FBH2", "0790731886", "B002LITH76", "B003L77GK6", "B00HR736LE", "B00008PHCZ", "B000MX7V5W", "B008CFZQQS", "B000P0J09M", "B000NVI2GU", "B0058YPG1G", "B0045HCJTO", "B0032UYFA6", "B004HW7JH4", "B00J5LXT44", "B0015ABRE2", "B00B5J6A7W", "B001GCUER0", "B001RTSPVY", "B000QXDJLI", "0783149956", "B0024FAR5M", "B002N5N5KW", "B00E1LT41K", "B001DJLCRC", "B00004XPPB", "B003UD7JAI", "B0002UE1WQ", "B003UD7J76", "B00123BY6S", "B000BGR1B4", "B008LCRA7K", "B000E6EK42", "B0038M2AOG", "B00009W5CA", "B0075FF5QM", "B0001HAGQK", "B003FSTN7U", "B008LCRABQ", "B0060MYKYY", "B0018CMJSU", "B00005Y6YJ", "B006TTC5HC", "B00FEP9MYG", "B0058YPGSY", "B002N5N5QQ", "B0076YFJUY", "B00066FBQG", "B000C20VRS", "B001FB4W0W", "B007A2Z3Y4", "B000R7HRRA", "B002TOL8UQ", "B000V86OKG", "B005FISBTO", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00029RTAI", "B00HUCF420"], "bought_together": ["B00008PW1F", "B00005NOHO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005NOHO", "B00008PW1F", "B00003CXOP", "B0007YMVWO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8704}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 22.99, "brand": "EMI", "asin": "B000067S1G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516nmEgm3uL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Sopranos: Season 3"}

{"description": "A little-known aspect of America's Vietnam War debacle--life in the temporary camps set up in the States for the thousands of refugees who came here after the fall of Saigon in 1975--is the subject of this 113-minute film, released in 2001. Director-cowriter Timothy Linh Bui and his brother, writer-producer Tony Bui, have made a movie that's obviously very sympathetic to its Vietnamese characters;Green Dragonis also apparently quite realistic, and refreshingly lacking in excessive sentimentality. Much of it is in Vietnamese (with English subtitles, of course); indeed, one senses that nominal top-liners Patrick Swayze and the always-reliable Forest Whitaker are on hand more for their star power than for the importance of their roles. In the end, this is a good story that's rather well told. The DVD is packed with extras, including director commentary, deleted scenes, trailers, and a behind-the-scenes documentary.--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0034JKYSC", "B0002J58GU", "6305133409", "B0000996F3", "B00008L3TK", "0783228686", "B0009ML2UG", "B002PQ1PBA", "B0001BRSRG", "B00000F8KW", "B002NALPFO", "B001B73Q20", "B004SUDQAE", "B004QXJZY4", "6305720134", "B00AEBB86U", "B0016MJ6WE", "B000ALM40I", "B000FI8MPW", "B000U788WU", "B0000714BP", "B00031V21M", "B00005YRQ2", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00005A3KS", "B000059TGG", "B000BMY2KQ", "B003D7JVIE", "B004OBQDHK", "B000MGUZCU", "B00393SFV6", "B001URA5Y8", "B000LPS34E", "B004EXWGIS", "0792838041", "B0000DIXDR", "B00003CYFD", "B00004WI53", "B0051HCVEU", "B00023BLXK", "B00005N5S2", "B00DU22OI6", "B009M4KSUW", "B000VACCPU", "B008E70EES", "1439149976", "B001BGS16W", "B000B8QG22", "B003DZAM3Y", "B009WGYXIS", "B000E1NWHS", "B0058ZPNBI", "B005LAIGYQ", "B004NTXH7C", "B00DZP1C2W", "B00BNH9NCU", "B0000VJG72", "1439149992", "B001AK3S4Y", "B0000AC8LR", "0790742853", "B0085Z3ABI", "B002L5NYMS", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00005OSJP", "B0002V7ON8", "B000J3OTT6", "B000E5N6LG", "B005LAIILM", "B0001FVECM", "B00028G7IO", "B0007VZ99E", "B005LAIGLE", "B000P2A5AS", "B000FUTVLY", "B007C4ZJ0S", "B00AEFXZ1C", "B00AEBB9E6", "B00005JOC9", "B006TTC5DQ", "0767836359", "B006TTC5HC", "B003UGLCIA", "B00AEFXT1S"], "buy_after_viewing": ["6305133409", "B0034JKYSC", "B00000F8KW", "B000FI8MPW"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 183801}, "asin": "B00006BS7R", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ho0lh2puL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Green Dragon"}

{"description": "Matthew McConaughey (U-571) and Christian Bale (SHAFT) star in an explosive action-packed adventure with bone-charring special effects that will have you glued to your seat! When workers in a London tunneling project awaken an unearthly fire-breathing beast from centuries of slumber, all hell breaks loose. Twelve-year-old Quinn (Bale) sees his mother, one of the workers, die trying to escape this new terror. Twenty years later as a \"fire chief,\" he tries to keep a group of refugees alive with fierce dragons dominating the air, burning the land and feeding on the ash. Unexpectedly, Van Zan (McConaughey), a hotshot American militia leader, shows up with a ragtag group of slayers on a perilous crusade to hunt down and destroy the beasts. Tempers flare when there is a struggle for leadership -- until both men realize only one species is getting out of this alive.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783225814", "B00005JLWN", "B00AEFXT7W", "B001EAWMGA", "B0000WN0SW", "6305692688", "B00006AUJR", "B000MGUZCU", "B000R9U3B0", "B000VKL6ZM", "B00002E20R", "B00007AJF4", "B00AEFZ2DG", "B000NA28I4", "B00003CXHJ", "B000Y7U98C", "B000CBCWRG", "B00000JMOD", "B002SG7Z7A", "B00AEBB8QK", "B0002YLCG0", "B000CNER1S", "B000WMA6R8", "B000N6TX1I", "B004BZ5AN2", "6304711891", "B00HOGBXS6", "B0007OCG5Q", "B000KX0IM2", "B001FU793A", "B003L20IG0", "B00IKM5LXG", "B002NZK5SM", "B002GHHHKQ", "B00HEPDGKA", "B002GIBVVQ", "B003L20IEW", "B00005JN0T", "B002ZG98N2", "B003C5FMNK", "B00D3LA5WG", "6304806434", "B004XFZ4JK", "0767817478", "B005LAIHSG", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B000G8P1Y6", "B002GHHHHO", "B00AEFXVCU", "B000095WW8", "B000IHY9TS", "B000093FLA", "B00027NVXE", "B000MXPE7O", "B001FB55HQ", "B0009MDPYM", "B0018O4YT0", "B00IIJ9F42", "B002NZK5VO", "B001OQCUZM", "B008JFUQZ2", "B002QW7ALM", "B00003CXSD", "B00AEBB91O", "B0068FZ0O2", "B004XQO90O", "B000MX7V70", "B0021L8UXA", "B007I1Q4W2", "B0012KJ0DK", "B000EQHXN2", "B004LWZW8I", "B0000844I8", "B003Z8ZC1G", "B007WZTMCI", "B000LC55F2", "B001EDVNNU", "B00AZTUUQK", "B001VLBDD0", "B005LAIHPE", "B002UOMH00", "B004EPYZOO", "B003AWRMCE", "B00AEBB89W", "B00CHMBQM0", "B00AJLHUA8", "B000YDOOEQ", "B00005JL78", "B0002V7OI8", "B0045HCIWW", "B00AEFXWXI", "B00AEFYW64", "B000FS9FCG", "0783231202", "B00005JMZK", "B004EPYZU8", "B000274T94", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AEFYXQI", "B00AEFXKZ8"], "bought_together": ["0783225814", "B00AEFXT7W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFZ2DG", "B004SBQAN8", "B0067EKYAY", "B00HWWUQWQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15002}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.0, "brand": "Touchstone Video", "asin": "B00006JDVV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51zLrfJuG3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Reign of Fire"}

Edie Falco, Angela Bassett and Timothy Hutton lead a remarkable ensemble cast.A tidal wave of change is coming to Delrona Beach, Florida. Out-of-state developers have descended upon the sleepy coastal community with the promise of big bucks and bigger changes.

Desiree (Oscar nominee Angela Bassett) left two years ago to escape scandal and make a name for herself as an actress. Reluctantly returning home, she finds her strong-willed mother (Mary Alice) unwilling to let go of the past.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00002E20R", "0767821432", "B0017M9ZNI", "B000068QP0", "B0000AMU29", "B0019UGY96", "B0010YSD90", "B00004TJKJ", "0767838440", "B0006GVJEO", "B0001EQIF6", "B000065FJC", "B00009Y3N0", "B00009Y3N3", "B00BTYRB58", "1560256915", "0767827902", "B00441GYOM", "B001KP2J3U", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B0016OM3TU", "B001VC99HQ", "B004QBWU02", "6305428522", "B009NYF2GQ", "B00BEIYKX0", "B000ICL3NI", "6305558205", "B001NLJ3O4", "B004YCKKFK", "B00BTYRB3U", "B000092T3P", "B000087F7Q", "B000YDMPB0", "B0039PGHB4", "B003EYVXQO", "B00004RE27", "B00AZL310A", "B0001US84Y", "B001EOQCJE", "B001E1HCRI", "B000IU37SO", "B0007Q6VY6", "B00004Y62V", "0792838300", "0767088018", "0783229429", "B001LM64S8", "B0009H97H6", "B0064MT1FI", "6305327068", "B0007P0YKY", "B002P7UCBI", "B0015OKWKI", "B00EV4EUT8", "B000KG4BD6", "B00005ASOU", "B00005T7HW", "B000WC39FY", "B0001ZMXGI", "B003ASLJJK", "B00AEBB82Y", "0783226853", "B0045HCJ94", "B001DE29SS", "B00005O0SO", "B001M9ELQ2", "B0043X1FM2", "B008JEJSB6", "B00GUO2SKA", "156025632X", "B00003CX8U", "6305416222", "B000022TSY", "B00AEFYVZQ", "B000077VRM"], "bought_together": ["B00002E20R", "B000068QP0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00002E20R", "B0017M9ZNI", "B0019UGY96", "B000068QP0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 85552}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.6, "brand": "Sony Pictures", "asin": "B00006L926", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51M850S635L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sunshine State"}

{"description": "The most fertile period of D.W. Griffith's early career is generously preserved in this special edition ofBiograph Shorts. A satisfied actor in early silent films, Griffith was hesitant when the American Biograph company offered him a director's job in 1908, but his first film, \"The Adventures of Dollie\" (reconstructed here from a Library of Congress paper print), gave Griffith the filmmaking fever, and from 1908 to 1913 he averaged two or three shortsper week, of which these 23 represent a comprehensive sampling. Obscurities mingle with masterpieces on two DVDs; highlights include 1909's \"A Corner in Wheat\" (which established Griffith's mastery of social realism); \"The Musketeers of Pig Alley,\" a pioneering gangster film shot on authentic New York locations; and \"The Battle at Elderbush Gulch,\" a dynamic early Western.Although many of these films appear on another compilation (D.W. Griffith: Years of Discovery), important exceptions include 1911's \"Enoch Arden\" (a prestigious adaptation of Tennyson's poem); \"The Usurer,\" one of Griffith's best films from 1910; \"The Last Drop of Water,\" a grand-scale Western made during Griffith's first trip to California (and an indication of grander films to come); and \"His Trust,\" the first of a two-part serial featuring Griffith's then-common use of blackfaced actors as \"noble Negroes.\" Most important (in addition to early appearances by Lillian Gish, Lionel Barrymore, and other silent stars) is the arc of progress that these films represent. In Griffith's capable hands, we witness \"flickers\" in their most rapid stage of development, incorporating new techniques (parallel action and cross-cutting, changing camera angles within a scene, dramatic close-ups) from a tireless innovator who would soon rise to the challenge of epic, feature-length productions.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005YUO9", "B00007CVS8", "B00JRHW4GK", "B00006FMBE", "0679755497", "630507559X", "B00D9BNOKK", "B0006Q93LA", "B001G2S49K", "B00005J75F", "B005QAGBY8", "B00D8HNRBG", "B0013K8J90", "B008D1EEI2", "B0009S4IKG", "B00007CVSA", "B0013XZ6R0", "0073386138", "B000LY271A", "B0054602XK", "B003YBNNMY", "B00D9BNONW", "B0000WN1JA", "B00AB2NWZ2", "B000094J75", "B000AP04MO", "B00AFQSZB0", "B00CL1SQHU", "B005J7K9CI", "B004XEEMA8", "B0082CDGSG", "B000O76Q0C", "B0056ANHCC", "B00AATUZLU", "B003ZYU3T6", "1608191052", "B00CVB6XF2", "B0040QYROA", "B00005QAPH", "B00393SFWU", "B009L147EE", "B008N3E016", "0783232063", "B002NTDX6O", "B004MQ6W5K", "B00AEFXSVE", "B004YOED9M", "B00004Y2QQ", "B000094J79", "B00782O7IY", "B009YX8LO6", "B005QAGC06", "B000NDFI60", "B007PK9MXE", "B001A8HTXC", "B0006GAOO0", "B002BVN3BO", "B00000J11G", "B00005JA9C", "B00004W19G", "0030076064", "B000BDGVR2", "B0006GAONG", "B002SROLUI", "B00008H2GZ", "B000AYEIK4", "B00004Z4TL", "6305470286", "B00009XN8Y", "B001GOEYAG", "B0000AKY5C", "B00005O5CC", "6305211264", "B00005JH9F", "B00478ED6S", "B000XPU4TO", "B003IKNCZY", "B0007M21ZI", "B000BC8T0K", "B000EUM4JQ", "9622093957"], "bought_together": ["B00005YUO9"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00006FMBE", "B00007CVS8", "B00007CVSA", "B00005J75F"]}, "price": 16.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 76085}, "asin": "B00007CVS9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51725AS3R0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Biograph Shorts"}

Instead of Asian-import \"rice rockets\" and hip-hop street gear, it's got Armani suits and Porsches--the latter being the specialty of ace car thief Ted Varrick, played by Charlie Sheen in a trashy break between the successes ofPlatoonandWall Street. Fresh-faced D.B. Sweeney plays the undercover cop assigned to infiltrate Varrick's chop shop, and the predictable screenplay (by Dick Wolf ofLaw & Orderfame) asks all the expected questions: Will Sweeney's loyalties turn? Will Varrick's sister (vacuous newcomer Lara Harris) learn his true identity? Will Charlie's hair remain perfectly groomed? The Faustian formula provides a few moments of standard suspense, and Sheen's bemused remark about \"lifestyles of the rich and aimless\" carries a sharp note of retrospective irony.

{"description": "Happily, Groucho is still Groucho in his first post-Marx brothers movie,  and that's enough to keep this showbiz farce going. The rather labored plot has  Groucho getting his longtime fianc&#xE9;e, Carmen Miranda, booked at Manhattan's  glamorous Copacabana club, but as two different performers: a Brazilian  bombshell (the usual Carmen Miranda act, without the pineapple on the head) and  a veiled French chanteuse called Mademoiselle Fifi. Some of the nightclub stuff  has a retro appeal, and the appearance of real-life showbiz columnists (like  Earl Wilson) brings a whiff ofSweet Smell of Success. But mostly there's  Groucho, still flinging one-liners in a zone of his own. Even when the material  isn't first-rate, his delivery never wavers from the withering skepticism of the  Marx brothers' early days.

{"description": "In 1966-67, with 100,000 meters of black-and-white film and freedom to shoot without a script, director Vilgot Sj&#xF6;man created a motion picture so rangy and multilayered that it became two separate, overlapping movies released a year apart:I Am Curious YellowandI Am Curious Blue.  Those are the colors of the Swedish flag, and   Sj&#xF6;man's film tapped into the political, social, and psychosexual condition of his nation on the eve of worldwide cultural revolution.It also became a envelope-pushing event in the history of sex in the cinema.  A feisty, rather zaftig actress-activist named Lena Nyman played a radical activist named Lena Nyman who, in between interviewing her fellow Swedes about everything from gender inequities to the morality of vacationing in Franco's Spain, spent lots of raunchy time in bed (and elsewhere).  The copious frontal nudity and a glimpse of oral-genital contact ensured an epic court battle in America, andI Am Curious Yellowbecame a must-see conversation piece.Decades later, it all seems not only fresher than it did then but oddly tender, even sweet.  Sj&#xF6;man, 42 years old to Nyman's 22, cast himself as her lover (which he was) as well as her director, and the film is occasionally \"interrupted\" by its own filming.  Sj&#xF6;man/\"Sj&#xF6;man\" has to watch Lena/\"Lena\" doing some very intimate things with costar B&#xF6;rje Ahlstedt.  B&#xF6;rje is playing a car salesman, but also playing \"himself\" as an actor sometimes intriguing against his director with \"Lena\"--not \"Lena the activist\" but \"Lena the actress,\" both of whom Lena the actress-for-real is playing.  The Pirandellianism is witty, raw, and lingeringly ambiguous.  And now DVD adds another layer if you happen to watch with the commentary track engaged and listen to the seventysomething Sj&#xF6;man, still musing wryly on the radical fusion of film and life at whose creation he was present.--Richard T.

Ironically, their relationship achieves redemption after Rudy's tragic error in judgement, and the brothers begin the process of mending their fractured relationship.  Ultiametly, Rudy is able to honor his big brother, as well as his people, with one exhilarating and life-affirming act of defiance, revealing the redemptive power of the love between the two brothers.", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 557941}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.98, "brand": "", "asin": "B000087F0V", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WNW9YFWPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Skins [VHS]"}

{"description": "TheIdentityDVD features are not quite as enticing as they sound.  Of chief interest is the extended branched version of the film (available in widescreen only), but there's only one added scene (an interesting but not critical minute-long sequence that would have been the first conference-room scene), and the differences in the alternate ending are so subtle that you'll miss them if you literally blink a few times.  There's no question it could affect audience perception, but unlike most alternate endings, it doesn't affect the actual outcome.  (Seespoilerfor more information.)  The four deleted scenes (which don't include either of the above-mentioned additions) aren't that exciting, and the optional director commentary notes that these deletions generally served to cut moments of character and comic relief in favor of moving the story along, which is one reason the film runs a brisk 90 minutes. James Mangold's director commentary on the feature is good, though, as he discusses such matters as the logistics of the perpetual downpour and a crucial bit of dialogue removed from the film's climax.  Considering that downpour and the contrasting darks and lights of the film, picture quality is good, and the thunder claps sound great in 5.1 sound so there are no complaints about the DVD's presentation of the film itself.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000TJ6PBK", "B00006AUJR", "B0009YA3OA", "B000DZ7YN8", "B00005JNY3", "B00AADAK5W", "1558908382", "B00008K77D", "B0002DB54A", "B000RGN2JI", "B00AEBB8NI", "B000P0I4O4", "B00003CXZ4", "B004ZNFTDQ", "B0015XHQVC", "B00026ZD04", "B00014NEZI", "B003LR5BD0", "B00092ZLSK", "B004SIP92O", "B00000JGHL", "B003VA3JUO", "B00BNH9NCU", "B00DZP1C2W", "B00I45844W", "B004YCKKFK", "B00011CZRE", "B0002234LS", "B001HVZOB6", "B005S9EJ8W", "B000A2UBN4", "B00HOGBXS6", "B000OYC7BW", "B0004Z31OS", "B00AEBB89W", "B00AEFXW8I", "B00009OWJY", "B002NZK5RI", "B00AEFXEGS", "B00007AJF8", "B003ASLJQ8", "B000R4SMCW", "B000069HZP", "B00003CXGA", "B00005V9HH", "B0001FR3IQ", "B00005JPT0", "B000SK5Z20", "B00008YJDK", "B0013D8LBS", "6305238065", "B0021L8UFI", "B004P7CN7W", "078322799X", "B001OQCV2E", "B0002WT4OE", "B00B6OEB18", "B00003CXKM", "B004SIP9RO", "B000RZIGUE", "B004B3PBFQ", "B004LWZW24", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00096S49Y", "B000LC55F2", "0783240295", "B00009L1TA", "B0034G4P30", "B002O3Z4WK", "B00005JLO8", "B001ILFUBE", "B00005JKIS", "B004SIP9MY", "6305718954", "B000ALM40I", "B0001Z52RU", "B0010X73ZG", "B000A5045Q", "B00005JMWP", "B00005JN2Z", "B000F5WR4W", "B0000648X0", "B0021L8UPS", "B00AEBBA2W", "6301971345", "B002UJIY7A", "B0006IIKQW", "B00B96TGQS", "B004BLJQOK", "B00AEFXKZ8", "6304806434", "B001NPD9LS", "B000U1ZV76", "B003L20IEW", "B00596WFE4", "B000GCFO0I", "B00005UQ9W", "B000053UIF", "B0000YTOL2"], "bought_together": ["B000TJ6PBK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000TJ6PBK", "B0012Q7M02", "B00006AUJR", "B00AEBBA2W"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30202}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.73, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00008EY9G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RKTbv5kkL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Identity"}

Within the house there is an intricate pecking order, which firmly   places everybody in a set social position and decides every aspect of   life--who can initiate conversation, who has pudding at lunch, who can   have a bath and when.

{"description": "Marking an assured directorial debut for actor John Malkovich,The Dancer Upstairsis a tense, nerve-jangling political thriller that values adult storytelling and emotional depth over cheap thrills. It's a challenge for those accustomed to the frantic pace of Hollywood thrillers, but attentive viewers will be richly rewarded by Malkovich's slow-burn approach to the film's terrorist plot, adapted by Nicholas Shakespeare from his ownnovel, based on the \"Shining Path\" movement that terrorized Peru in the 1980s. The plot unfolds in an unnamed Latin American capital, where a lawyer-turned-police detective named Rejas (Javier Bardem) leads an investigation to locate Ezequiel, a terrorist whose followers have left a trail of fear, death and destruction across the city. Rejas falls in love with his daughter's ballet teacher (Laura Morante), but the film's ultimate revelation--a coincidence that Malkovich handles with credible delicacy--throws this simmering drama into stark relief, bringing Bardem's character (and his subtle performance) to a greater awareness of his own personal and political humanity.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0011FLH14", "B00116GEJ8", "B00003CXRG", "B00080Z53O", "B0041KKYF6", "B001DN0UY4", "B0036TGSJE", "B004MOJW0E", "B001DJ7PR8", "B000K2V7F0", "B008YYSD3U", "B000088UZ4", "B00005LZOD", "B000N3T0DW", "B00AZMFKXK", "B000GUJYH4", "0385721072", "B0001DCYMI", "B00005N8A9", "B00005JLQW", "B00008AOX5", "B003Z8ZC2A", "B009B8YMB0", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005JNCZ", "B00001ODHV", "B004XVMCMG", "B000CCD1RA", "B002VECLXC", "B0007NBJHI", "B00005JL57", "B000274TLW", "B002FHGESI", "B008FYZHHE", "B0002TT0MI", "B00018D40O", "B0006Z2NKO", "B001UV4XRY", "B000PISZ7W", "B004AE3QYE", "B00000F7E6", "B00006G8G3", "B00000K3TU", "B000F7CMRM", "0140157654", "B0007OCG5G", "B000C3L2PC", "B00HRISNPM", "B004YCKKH8", "B00008L3S6", "B006DHATE6", "B0030Y1282", "B002SF9YNY", "B003Z8ZC0M", "B002I5GNZQ", "B00006L91I", "B000J3OTOG", "B0000A2ZTY", "B008XAT0U0", "B00004Z1FK", "B00HEEAMCG", "B000Y54UUC", "B000N6TX1I", "B002T4GXUG", "B002DU39GW", "B001LRJH0U", "B0081HLM2E", "B0013XZ2QK", "B002LVVCJY", "B00AQBDU4Q", "B002ZG993Q", "B00005JL6M", "B001WLMOL4", "B008FYZJ2C", "B0000AMU29", "B0016LFG3S", "B004ZJZQ92", "B00AEFXRWO", "B00AEFY8MM", "B001FB5634", "B0000TPAH4", "B002EOVWVQ", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B000E5KURY", "B002M2T1VI", "B005CFBZ3O", "B000O76ZQC", "B0043X1FNQ", "B00GPPXNIK", "B000CCW2O8", "B001N44BVQ", "B004CIIXDC", "B00008L3TF", "B001URA5Y8", "B00003CXXY", "B0016MJ6HY", "B000G0O5IM", "B004SIP6BI", "B000QGE84M"], "bought_together": ["B0011FLH14"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0011FLH14", "B00003CXRG", "B004XVMCMG", "B001DJ7PR8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 85585}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.79, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B0000AGQ5V", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4173C4VBCSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Dancer Upstairs"}
{"description": "He's the Wild Blue Yonder, andThe Tickis back to show why this outlandishly funny TV series should never have been canceled! After proving his mettle in comic books and animated TV, creator Ben Edlund's blue-insect superhero made his auspicious debut on Fox (in November 2001), portrayed in live action (in a buff-muscled rubber suit) by Patrick Warburton, the popularSeinfeldguest star (as \"Puddy\"), who instantly perfected the role he was born to play. In his appreciative commentary track, co-executive producer (andMen in Blackdirector) Barry Sonnenfeld calls the pilot episode \"the best thing I've ever directed,\" and it's easy to agree: wide-angle lenses, stylized sets, hilarious dialogue, and a comedically gifted cast make the episode (and the entire series) a perfect summation of Sonnenfeld's wacky style. Edlund concurs, observing thatThe Tickis \"something you get or you don't,\" and the impatient Fox executives obviously didn't get the show's expert blend of absurdity, stupidity, and good-natured irreverence. They axed the series after eight of these nine episodes aired, only proving thatThe Tickwas too hip for their bean-counting mentalities.In the title role, Warburton (with highly expressive antennae) hits all the right notes of dimwitted innocence and brute-force gallantry, aided immeasurably by his moth-costumed sidekick Arthur (David Burke), wannabe lothario Batmanuel (Nestor Carbonell), and buxom beauty Captain Liberty (Liz Vassey). Attentive to the more mundane aspects of superheroism,The Tickoffers outrageous villains (like the nefarious \"Destroyo\") and eccentric allies (like Ron Perlman's hilarious \"Fiery Blaze\") while showing that even crimefighters have everyday problems and desires. Brilliantly conceived and executed,The Tickcan now be enjoyed by an audience it never had a proper chance to cultivate.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000Q6775O", "B000FS9MVK", "B003FVB7DU", "B0002PYSB0", "B002WJHDJI", "B00008EY6Q", "B000F7CMPE", "B001PU8N12", "B0007LPSI6", "B0017INRG8", "B000FJH5MC", "B0001ZX0EW", "B001WAKNCC", "B00H4WGGXW", "B00F3L8P26", "B00114UUAE", "B00HR2WIRC", "B001XW7ICW", "B007QD0VOE", "B000H6SY14", "B00L326LTI", "B001KEGR7U", "B000WC39P4", "B006LPHY6G", "B006H3KQWG", "B004EXWGJW", "B00094ARGY", "B00008AOTD", "B004XM38CS", "B00I099JZK", "B00153ZS3K", "B0025KVKBQ", "B000Q66PX4", "B00283QELG", "B00006IGVK", "B0018BDDH2", "B001NOMO38", "B000EMGIDC", "B001EN5I3Q", "B007AFC0W4", "B000SMNL92", "B002FE5XU6", "B00HZMZ286", "B000Y5CJNC", "B00JJOY41E", "B001B7CNX8", "B008R52LA2", "B000B8I9XQ", "B0001MZ7K0", "B000ARXF7I", "B0000WN15E", "B00HWWUQYY", "B000H7JCFK", "B0056GLNQI", "B003626TNG", "B000CQQIKS", "B00BTRKMNI", "B00006AUJG", "B000BQ7J6Q", "B004EXWGHY", "B001FB4VZ8", "B000WC38FA", "B00404ME2E", "B00GUALJUO", "B0053WQE6O", "B000G6BLGK", "B00466HORQ", "B00097DY2U", "B005G5NPD8", "B007CO5MVE", "B000FO0AG0", "B00000JL42", "B0000JD28S", "B0006UEVUE", "B0002JP4DW", "B001DF681G", "B005FXXTC8", "B00HCK7THS", "B000WLU5ZM", "B00C2535PI", "B00061QJSK", "B0016B6ZJW", "B0051PLQR0", "B00FPUN57K", "B001AQO3XS", "B008AITJ7O", "B000U1ZV2G", "B00AQ590IC", "B000ATQYVA", "B00158K0V0", "B000PAAJZG", "B000GIXLWA", "B001CQONOA", "B00GSSD73K", "B00466HOR6", "B004TFTE86", "B000IJ79X4", "B000PKG8TW", "B00AKK6MD4", "B000FI8MPC"], "bought_together": ["B000FS9MVK", "B000Q6775O"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FS9MVK", "B00H4WGGXW", "B000Q6775O", "B007QD0VOE"]}, "price": 17.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 112321}, "asin": "B0000AUHQE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K3YoVwnDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Tick: The Entire Series"}

{"description": "Director Robert Duvall (THE APOSTLE) weaves the disparate worlds of murder and dance in this quirky and sometimes impressionistic comedy drama. John (Robert Duvall), an old-school Coney Island-area hit man, is offered a lucrative job in Argentina. He doesn't really want to take it, and his reluctance to leave his beloved stepdaughter Jenny (Katherine Micheaux Miller) and miss her birthday party fuels his obstinacy. But, assured he will be back in time, he takes the job. Once in Buenos Aries, the assassination plot begins to unfold, then sputter, and finally falls apart as the target fails to show up. Needless to say, John misses Jenny's big day, and to get his mind off of things, he catches a traditional Argentinean tango performance. With a reverence for American dance, John is totally blown away by this thrillingly expressive form, and infiltrates the tango circuit through Manuela (Luciana Pedraza), a glowing but modest partner. She and her sister escort John through the history and motion that is tango, while in the meantime the assassination plot picks back up as the target finally returns to Buenos Aries. Much like the dance it depicts, the film navigates between one world of murderous intrigue and conspiracy, and the other of sensual elegance and high-art aesthetics. Duvall also bridges the gulf between these worlds with an inimitable performance", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 351572}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.61, "brand": "", "asin": "B0000DI880", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/418DP7PK5KL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Assassination Tango (Slip) [VHS]"}

{"description": "Partly inspired by 1948'sThe Big Clockand its nominal 1987 remakeNo Way Out, the Denzel Washington thrillerOut of Timeis quite enjoyable if you ignore its implausible plotting. Like those earlier films, this reunion of Washington and hisDevil in a Blue Dressdirector Carl Franklin is about a man--in this case the police chief (Washington) of sleepy Banyan Key, Florida--who falls into a trap set by others, sinks into legal quicksand of his own making, and must race the clock to extricate himself from a series of incriminating setbacks. The Florida setting adds welcome character to the potboiler plot, and Washington's screen-cred makes it easy to overlook the absurdities of rookie writer David Collard's screenplay. Eva Mendes is sharp and sensible as Washington's estranged wife (do you think they'll reconcile for a happy ending?), and the talented John Billingsley--whose portrayal of \"Dr. Phlox\" on TV'sEnterpriseis vastly underrated--is a constant delight as Washington's medical examiner, beer buddy and wily co-conspirator.

{"description": "Guns, guns, guns! And a few explosions as bodies fly through the air and crash into tables and fruit stands.Once Upon a Time in Mexico, like all Robert Rodriguez movies, is all about the kinetic kick of high-velocity action. Johnny Depp, blase and whimsical, plays a CIA agent who's drawn guitar-playing gun-slinger Antonio Banderas (long black hair flopping over his face like the ears of a Labrador puppy) into a ridiculously convoluted plot to overthrow the Mexican government.

{"description": "BetweenFriends' fifth and sixth seasons, Courteney Cox and David Arquette were married, leading to \"The One After Vegas\" adding \"Arquette\" after everyone's title credits. Unfortunately, on-screen it's divorce time again despite \"The One When Ross Hugs Rachel,\" since he secretly tries avoiding an annulment of their accidental marriage. Far more out in the open is Chandler (Matthew Perry) and Monica's (Cox) relationship. Moving in together creates lots of fun as the others move back and forth into each other's apartments. It also leads to Joey (Matt LeBlanc) finally showing a tender side toward temporary roommate Janine (Elle Macpherson). By now his chat-up catchphrase \"How you doin'?\" had caught on, but he needed to fall for someone. He kept the fun alive all year, pretending to have a Porsche, starting work on the showMac and C.H.E.E.S.E., and falling for Chandler's (Matthew Perry) card game Cups in the excellent \"The One with the Last Night\" (one of many directed by David Schwimmer).More fun came from Ross (Schwimmer) trying to teach everyone the mental discipline Unagi, popping ridiculous moves with Monica for their childhood dance routine and having a fluorescently dazzling smile in \"The One with Ross's Teeth\" (also featuring a near-silent cameo from Ralph Lauren). Far more talkative was Reese Witherspoon as Rachel's (Jennifer Aniston) sister--another temptation for Ross. What they briefly had wasn't as complicated as later in \"The One Where Ross Meets Elizabeth's Dad,\" who turns out to be an Emmy-winning Bruce Willis (thanks to having become friends with Perry duringThe Whole Nine Yards). The fans' need for love interest and continuity had established the seasons' format now. Another two-part finale offers jeopardy--then resolution--from Tom Selleck's Richard in \"The One with the Proposal\" between Chandler and Monica.--Paul Tonks", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001AW066", "B0000C2IXN", "B003TNW03K", "B0006ZM8M2", "B003TNW04Y", "B0000844MI", "B003TNW03A", "B000068CNX", "B003TNW02G", "B005IA9JQI", "B005IA9JSG", "B005MG8UNG", "B005IA9JQ8", "B00020HAWY", "B005IA9JVI", "B000ERVK5S", "B00B1LKXPY", "B008LCRA98", "B008LCRABQ", "B008LCRAFC", "B008LCRAC0", "B0007R4SWC", "B008L0YMZA", "B0058JEHTS", "B00005JLEX", "B000A7PKGW", "B000NA1PUG", "B000EHSVN2", "B002BAW6I6", "B008KZX7W0", "B000EHSVM8", "B000U1ZV1W", "B0001907BW", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B0006FFRBG", "B002BAW6HW", "B000NOKFH6", "B000N6TYLW", "B001VPJYZ0", "B000HT3P7E", "B005SJGIV8", "B008LCRA7K", "B0002UE1WQ", "B000Q6GUW0", "B000640WGM", "B000G1R3A8", "B0019CSXAM", "B000GETTKM", "B0012BS5XU", "B000BNTM46", "B007C8RZQ0", "B000TM1CKQ", "B000AAF1U4", "B001DPHDBU", "B002Q5WHF8", "B00005JNEQ", "B000GRUMQY", "B000NJISIY", "B000GPIPTM", "B000EHSVMS", "B008JBJAM6", "B000AJJNI6", "B000F0UUTG", "B000EBGFPY", "B000P6YNSO", "B004GJYRFA", "B00005JO9J", "B00005JLFT", "B000G1R4SY", "B00005JOHC", "B0018CWEXK", "B000T22PVG", "B003YLM79E", "B000SINT4S", "B0024FAR6Q", "B000BOH990", "B0015ABRE2", "B001DJLD2G", "B003R0MF7G", "B002BWOYKC", "B000FL7CAK", "B0001ZMWXW", "B0001CCXZW", "B00000F5W8", "B001VPJZ0O", "B00FRILRL6", "B004GJYRA0", "B00004TJKK", "B002BJGYU8", "B001TKJDNA", "B00AMHFMOK", "B000V86OKG", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000QFCDAO", "B001FB4VZS", "B001RIZ7OI", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B0009OL7Z4", "B004EPZ0BG", "B003F3NE1Q"], "bought_together": ["B0001AW066", "B0000C2IXN"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003TNW04Y", "B005IA9JRM", "B0000C2IXN", "B0000844MI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 51393}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 24.65, "brand": "Warner Bros", "asin": "B0000X2ECE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510SVY4JD9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Friends: Season 6"}

Written by, directed by, and starring various talents blacklisted during the McCarthy-era witch hunts of the 1950s entertainment industry, the film stars Woody Allen as Howard, a cashier and bookie approached by blacklisted television-writer Alfred (Michael Murphy) to act as a \"front,\" i.e., the alleged author of Alfred's works. The scam proves hugely successful. Soon Howard is fronting for several other banned writers, taking a cut from every sale to the networks, and basking in praise (and romantic attentions) for his prolific talent.

{"description": "The compellingCoyote Waitsis based on one of the Leaphorn and Chee mystery novels by Tony Hillerman (all three have been adapted for television), concerning a partnership, of sorts, between an experienced Navajo detective, Joe Leaphorn (Wes Studi), and a young reservation cop, Jim Chee (Adam Beach). When the latter's colleague and friend ends up shot to death and left to burn in a fiery car, Chee takes time off to evaluate whether he should become a healer instead of a lawman. Either way, he can't proceed without getting to the bottom of the killing and proving or disproving his own original assumption that the murderer is a shaman he found drunk and in possession of a gun near the crime.  Working the case from a different angle is Leaphorn, who finds a link between the shaman and a missing university professor on the trail of a major historical find. Beach and Studi are terrific, though the story doesn't bring them together, in the same space, very often. (The two characters do most of their communicating by phone.) Familiar faces in the supporting cast include Gary Farmer (Dead Man), Keith Carradine (Deadwood), and Graham Greene (Dances with Wolves). Sheila Tousey is outstanding in her recurring role as Emma Leaphorn, Joe's wise, no-nonsense wife.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000V2IOXC", "B000AXWHP8", "B0000JCFN6", "B0000D0YWJ", "B003Y7F1OG", "B00019330O", "B000087F0X", "B000UL61KW", "B0046ZYEU2", "B0001FVDI2", "6305428417", "B001N5BDX4", "0767812182", "0062270486", "B001PSUM9K", "B00CLH09JM", "B00005OSJN", "B000AGTPVY", "B0025Z4Q3U", "B000A2WA9C", "B0008FXSSS", "B001AR0D54", "0061374296", "0062018027", "B0001I55YW", "0062018043", "0061967815", "0061808377", "0061967831", "B001UW59JO", "0061967785", "1607811375", "B0007R8E54", "B00CS7GYF8", "B007PXYWNQ", "B00003L9BB", "B000UVV274", "0061967823", "0061808393", "B003XMKU48", "0060815116", "0061967807", "1482393182", "B0002S65WC", "0061967769", "0062018116", "0061808385", "B0001FGBWU", "1492358444", "B000AQ6A9E", "0767817672", "0061808407", "0061967793", "B0007UDC80", "0061808369", "B00006RG78", "B0041518AQ", "0061967777", "B00337DRGQ", "B00JJRLFTU", "0061808350", "B00FWSWORC", "B004UOHNIY", "B0009S4II8", "B009B6XJVQ", "B00CDWQNMW", "B00HUAGYF8", "B007ZXW3LY", "B00EIXWW2O", "0062270494", "B000BQ7J98", "0060544481", "B0037ZHPYY", "B009DS31ZG", "B00C12ZISE", "0060505869", "B00C68SK24", "B0074JOCTU", "B00GHH9I62", "B005J7K9BO", "B008RO6PJQ", "B002JDWNSS", "B000ELJ3E4", "B005HIBWPM", "B000FBFZ18", "B002K0WBVE", "B00IBKXQJS", "0060815094", "B009DS6YGO", "B00GD7UO6E", "B00D49YDR0", "0060815078", "B00A92MD8G", "B004X9LNAU", "B00CLB7CFM", "B00028G7IO", "0060820780", "B00J3M54AW", "B002DHACT2"], "bought_together": ["B000V2IOXC", "B000AXWHP8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002IFSA8O", "B0000JCFN6", "B000AXWHP8", "B000V2IOXC"]}, "price": 18.91, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 36974}, "asin": "B00015YVPO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CN5B14S9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mystery!

{"description": "Torrid sex and tortured emotions fill the screen inLeaving  Metropolis. David (Troy Ruptash), a successful painter,  has lost his  inspiration. To find stimulation, he gets a job at a small, out-of-the-way  diner, run by married couple Violet (Cherilee Taylor) and Matt (Vincent  Corazza,Owning Mahoney). When sparks fly with Matt, David gets  stimulation and inspiration--but the portraits he paints of Matt may break  the couple apart. The machinations of a bitter friend bring the situation  to a boil. Though filled with lots and lots of sex (both gay and  straight),Leaving Metropolispays as much attention to the  character's minds as to their flesh (well, almost as much--the sex scenes  are quite extensive and the bodies are all beautiful). Some of the  script's metaphors are a little clumsy, but the psychology is convincing.

{"description": "A bizarre footnote from film history comes to life inAnd Starring Pancho Villa as Himself, an ambitious made-for-HBO opus that casts a jaundiced eye on Hollywood and politics. It's based on truth:  in 1913, a movie crew went to Mexico to film general Pancho Villa, who was in the middle of leading a revolution in his country. Screenwriter Larry Gelbart and director Bruce Beresford use this mind-boggling situation to measure various Hollywood absurdities, but also to comment on the way showbiz has bent reality to fit convenient, crowd-pleasing expectations. Antonio Banderas gets a full head of steam going as Villa; he's so much better than anybody else in the movie, he underscores the weak performances of the other leads. You get the impression there were so many good anecdotes about this production, the movie can't quite find a focus. Still, for aficionados of movie lore, it's an absorbing look back at truly wild days.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0016LFG2Y", "B00E5G03KM", "B000BF0CL6", "B002H0OFKW", "0786710888", "0804730466", "B004IF4EVY", "B000067D25", "B001GECB3S", "B0013XZ76A", "B001D7T6BI", "B002AISASE", "B00BLYCB1K", "B00008VGKO", "B00008VGKV", "B0000WN140", "B006GXWHLU", "B0002DRDBY", "B0047685T6", "B00180IPM6", "0803222246", "B000UVV24M", "B000K7VHNW", "B000EOTUSA", "B004SIP7S0", "B00DYCOOQC", "B0045HCJTO", "B000RHRGSK", "B000BNTM9G", "1933693045", "B00GJNQ3S0", "B008GFZWRW", "0292790244", "B0008ENHUS", "0783228007", "B00005JNCZ", "B000EHSVWS", "B000BDH6E4", "B005HFI7IU", "B001TK80D4", "1933693088", "B0001NBMI0", "B0045HCJ5S", "B000056H2J", "B00F3TDA6O", "B0000A2ZU1", "B009INAI02", "B00005LOL5", "B00J49R1BY", "B00BTYU3UI", "B000VUFJ0K", "B0001CNQX0", "B0002VEZ3U", "B00AEFYSEA", "B000AMWIUI", "B002FHGESI", "B0007OY2OY", "B00005A05K", "0783241909", "B00BTYSIV4", "B006LL3W0W", "B0001ZMXGI", "B00FL2F1O2", "B0095ZIHZ6", "B000CEXGAU", "B0011FLH14", "B000A7Q1O2", "B00DU22OI6", "B0042EJDGM", "B000F8O2QU", "B004J04KXU", "B0014BJ1A4", "B000BT96DC", "B0007OY2OE", "B002WJHBCC", "B001GH3CL0", "B00005N8A9", "B000WC38IC", "B008GFZWGI", "B0007MAO0C", "B005BQKCII", "B00028G7IO", "0143105272", "B003AWRMCE", "B00008CMSZ", "B00000J11D", "B00132D7Y0", "B007L6VPXC", "B00652U6JC", "B00005V4XV", "B005UZNCAA", "B000GIW9I2", "B00AEFXFW6", "B00IVLR9JA", "B00003CXB5", "B000YKT4BW", "B004UOHNIY", "B00006ADEM", "B000PAAJVA", "B0007OY2NA"], "bought_together": ["B0016LFG2Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0016LFG2Y", "B008GFZWRW", "B001GECB3S", "0804730466"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 43384}, "asin": "B0001FVECM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51y9asxvO2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "And Starring Pancho Villa As Himself"}

{"description": "For many fans, the Superman revisionist seriesSmallvilletruly hit its stride in its second season, when it shifted focus from traditional comic book conflicts to one of self-discovery for its hero, a teenage Clark Kent (Tom Welling).  Fans and first-timers can judge for themselves with this six-disc set, which compiles all 23 episodes and a decent selection of supplemental features. Whereas season 1 focused on Clark using his powers to combat a host of menaces &#xE0; la the WB's other big fantasy hit,Buffy the Vampire Slayer, season 2 delved into Clark's past and the extent of his super powers, most notably in the back-to-back \"Heat,\" in which he discovers his heat vision, and \"Red,\" in which red kryptonite in the high school class rings uncorks Clark's less-than-upstanding side. Other plot developments from the season that pull the series in interesting directions include the arrival of Dr. Helen Bryce (Emanuelle Vaugier), who becomes involved with Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum), but the season's most significant moment comes during episode 17, \"Rosetta,\" in which Clark learns of his Kryptonian origins courtesy of a scientist, who, in an effective bit of casting, is played bySupermanfilm star Christopher Reeve.The complexity of the writing and issues dealt with in season 2 markedSmallvilleas a series with depth and drama worthy of its considerable fan following as well as a second boxed set; fittingly, the supplements in this set are more expansive than on the first one.  Producers Alfred Gough, Miles Millar, and Greg Beeman and cast members Welling, Rosenbaum, and Kristen Kreuk weigh in on commentary tracks for two episodes (\"Red\" and \"Rosetta\"), while a trio of short featurettes explore Christopher Reeves's appearance in \"Rosetta,\" the show's visual effects, and the amusing \"Wall of Weird\" web page maintained by Chloe (Allison Mack). The extras are rounded out by a handful of deleted scenes and a gag reel.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002Y0QV2", "B00005JLKB", "B0009A5MUO", "B000G1R4SO", "B000N6SE4U", "B000X5SMXY", "B001FB4VZS", "B002JVWRDQ", "B003L77GG0", "B000R206FK", "B002JVWRE0", "B001FB4W02", "B0012U7IWU", "B003L77GGA", "B00G4SCKAK", "B00080ZG2O", "B00BBXSPES", "B000BT96EG", "B00BBXSPCK", "B00BGI086Q", "B004XWLN20", "B00DTRR43W", "B000EHSVLE", "B00ED2IBXE", "B000EHSVLY", "B000FP2OPY", "B000F8O2OM", "B00260HH30", "B00133QNRW", "B009LDCXNY", "B00JF5G8WU", "B000R7GKQE", "B001MVWRNE", "B00CN009Y2", "B000EU1Q2M", "1401241824", "B00DYEN6XC", "B004YM6JI2", "B0001CNRS4", "B000B8384G", "B000I0QLR8", "B004YM6JLO", "1401243096", "B006LG74Q0", "B002JVWRB8", "B001DJLD2G", "B000BT96FA", "B000EHSVKK", "B004YPED14", "B0000AKY3Q", "B000NOKFGW", "B0015RRNMA", "B002JVWRD6", "B0058YPGL6", "B002JVWRAO", "B00915G4IC", "B007MDB6Y2", "B0001EFTH4", "B000X5SPBI", "B00005Y71G", "B001EWDXT8", "B000EHSVL4", "B005SH63HO", "B000HT3P60", "B00F4FFO8E", "B004LROMWU", "B000I0QLS2", "B002JVWR4A", "B000CCBC9O", "B0018RKEQY", "B0018CWEYY", "1401246370", "B00280LZAE", "B00915G6SU", "B0002CX1M0", "B0012BS5XU", "B001FB4W0C", "B004HW7JNS", "B00IYRLUAU", "B0019LY5IM", "B0053O89IS", "B000IJ79UW", "B000RO6JYK", "B000SMNL92", "B00EIL7E9C", "B001FB4VXU", "B00E5I2MDQ", "B00IGVJGZK", "B00HQOFAKI", "B00AEBBA36", "B004FQX5B6", "B0052C5EI4", "B0000DIXDR", "B00GZ0ML4C", "B008JFUS0U", "B008X6N8KW", "B00DXLO0D6", "B00CL151G4", "B000EHSVG4", "B005IA9JQ8"], "bought_together": ["B0002Y0QV2", "B00005JLKB"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JLKB", "B004XWLN20", "B0002Y0QV2", "B000N6SE4U"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6376}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 23.99, "brand": "WEA", "asin": "B0001JXPPC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YFOkMz2tL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Smallville: Season 2"}

{"description": "The Dukes of Hazzardwas part of America's redneck fetish in the mid-to-late 1970s, otherwise evident in popular songs, movies, and television shows highlighting fast cars, truckers, citizens' band radio, moonshine, irreverent hicks, and clueless lawmen. Created by writer-producer Gy Waldron and inspired by his own 1975 bootlegging comedy,Moonrunners,Dukesmilked seven seasons of material from the tale of a Deep South family of reformed whiskey-makers and their running feud with a greedy impresario and his chief lackey, a buffoonish, venal sheriff.This three-disc set includes all 13 initial episodes ofDukesfrom 1979, a period fans fondly recall because some of the programs were shot on location in Covington, Georgia, rather than a Burbank backlot. Also noteworthy is that a couple of key characters, particularly Hazzard County's corrupt lawman, Roscoe P. Coltrane (James Best), hadn't gelled yet into permanent hayseed stereotypes and were arguably more interesting at the beginning. At the center of the action is Sheriff Coltrane's nemeses, cousins Bo Duke (John Schneider) and Luke Duke (Tom Wopat), a couple of wild boys buzzing through the backwoods in the \"General Lee,\" a souped-up Dodge Charger. Bo and Luke are good at heart but have to behave themselves while on indefinite probation, complicating but not halting their efforts to vex Roscoe and his patron, diminutive bigwig Boss Hogg (Sorrell Booke). The enmity runs both ways: Roscoe and Boss Hogg, with the aid of witless Deputy Enos Strate (Sonny Shroyer), dream up ways of eliminating the Dukes--including their wise old Uncle Jesse (Denver Pyle)--but their efforts always backfire.While every episode is a variation on the previous one, predictability is a virtue inDukes. The series pilot, \"One Armed Bandits,\" finds Luke and Bo, with help from their sexy cousin, Daisy (Catherine Bach), diverting slot machines (smuggled into Hazzard County by Roscoe and Boss Hogg) to sundry watering holes where they can raise money for Bo's girlfriend's charity. In \"Money to Burn,\" Boss Hogg tries to frame Bo and Luke for robbing an armored truck, while in \"Deputy Dukes,\" the unarmed guys are forced by Roscoe to escort a deadly prisoner from one town to another. The Dukes hit back in \"Daisy's Song,\" investigating a scam that took Daisy for $50 and implicates, of course, Boss Hogg and Roscoe.Yes, it's a show about rubes, car stunts, and a legacy of moonshine, but there's something comforting about it, in a tongue-in-cheek way.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006BAWR4", "B0007XG26G", "B0009S4IM4", "B000BB1MJ6", "B000HLDF9U", "B000EMG90O", "B0014VPFM2", "B000L4WWJM", "B002Q6QBI6", "B000BB8VM2", "B000M7FOO8", "B007A2Z19G", "B000BKJ758", "B000HQ4GWA", "B004MTTZIS", "B005KL76BK", "B001J0FVYK", "B000H3BSY2", "B001G4S5SI", "B005KL6VH0", "B0045DO8E2", "B004GF9W0O", "B002F1R6KY", "B000EQHXOG", "B003VRJ89S", "B0036ELHOK", "B000AARQI4", "B00029XHZ4", "B007KW5M6I", "B00JQNFRF0", "B000BUE5CI", "B000E5KQLY", "B0007LXP7W", "B0024FAD7Y", "B001PU8MY0", "B00008O38I", "B0010VZ91I", "B00FWMVVJ0", "B00H4DV4ZG", "B00BUWD7NE", "B00005BQW5", "B001BN4WHW", "031235374X", "B001G4ZG1C", "B008WAM2DI", "B00BCNXOWA", "B0002W4SWW", "B000GW8U9U", "B000SQFC2M", "B000002PGD", "B0035QQEYM", "B00GHX0JUU", "B0006IUDXA", "B0007OCG74", "B00005JO4F", "B000LUORB2", "B000AMCW4K", "B000EXZFS0", "B000CELOV8", "B0006N2F0E", "B00GX7D5JW", "B000HEZEYG", "B000B7HZUK", "B003H9LIRK", "B00COHGPD8", "B004UV3KS4", "B00HVFA36I", "B0002I837M", "B0000VD11E", "B005LAIH9A", "B00076ONT6", "B0000V4906", "B002N57KG2", "B00005JM3A", "B0050MB5AC", "B001BN4WK4", "B002XGZTRI", "B00005JLR2", "B003BGZ61S", "B00DJYK1XU", "B000TZI2FQ", "B00D2UMHB0", "B000UX6TL6", "B00DYQ1GBE", "B00B39FGIS", "B000G2OYZE", "B001DSNELU", "B001DSNEME", "B00005JOHC", "B007XF0WXA", "B000291Q3Y", "B00005JMQW", "B00009QG5P", "B00IN69P0E", "B00IMENO9K", "B006ZL1P84", "B00GOC75YW", "B00DXLO086", "B000EBGFQI", "B00JDCP0QA"], "bought_together": ["B0006BAWR4", "B0007XG26G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0006BAWR4", "B000HLDF9U", "B0014VPFM2", "B0007XG26G"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 24764}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 29.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001WTWXI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61hPa5VJdAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Dukes of Hazzard: Season 1"}
{"description": "Al Pacino shambles about in pure weary Late Pacino form inPeople I Know, a 1970s-style paranoid number with a political tinge to it. Pacino plays an old-school publicist, once a friend to Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King, who's now down to his last big client, a vaguely dangerous movie star (nice turn by Ryan O'Neal). As Pacino tries to keep his client's indiscretions out of the papers, he's dragged into an intriguing drugs-murder-politics conspiracy. There are juicy possibilities in Jon Robin Baitz's script, and with a topnotch director and a little more oomph they might have blossomed. As it is, despite a couple of nifty gotchas, the movie never quite gets into full stride. Tea Leoni shines as an addicted actress with a flinty vocabulary, but Kim Basinger is less lucky with her plot-device role. Pacino looks as though he's about to draw his last breath in every shot, which is precisely how he should look.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SUDQ1S", "B000CBCWRG", "B00007G1YQ", "B003EV6DCG", "B0015OKWL2", "B00005JLX2", "B00BTYRB3U", "B00BLF9FYA", "B001C5LLLY", "B000A9QK6E", "B00005JKG9", "B00008CMRK", "B003LR5BD0", "B00005JO5L", "B00441GYPG", "B000A9QK50", "B000A9QK5K", "B00127RAGC", "B00000JGHL", "B00AEBB95K", "B000CNESTE", "B004P7CMUU", "B007FO5PV8", "B0045HCJ8K", "B001UDS4BS", "B003ELMR9E", "B0000AM6JI", "B0001I2BUI", "B00004XPPB", "B006LL3WP2", "B00BB67UNW", "B000BYY11Y", "0792835727", "B006GVN05O", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00CX7TOOG", "0792833287", "B00FRILRL6", "B0009GX1CO", "6305308837", "B002NZK5UU", "6301971345", "6304584210", "B00BEIYIF0", "B00BEIYKX0", "B00BEIYKM6", "B00003CWRX", "6304765258", "B002DU39GW", "B0000DI87S", "B00DZP1C2W", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B0034G4OSG", "B00005JKNV", "B0010SAGHS", "0800141806", "B00AEFXN9G", "B000P0J0AG", "B004SEUJBE", "B005S9ELVC", "B00BEIYLO8", "B000C20VRS", "B001P3SA94", "B003L20IG0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004SUDQ1S", "B00007G1YQ", "B00008CMRK", "0783226845"]}, "price": 4.21, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 274053}, "asin": "B0001XAPWY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510TMCDW2YL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "People I Know"}

{"description": "Johnny Depp gets high off another acting challenge in this tricky adaptation of aStephen King yarn. Although the mood is too sinister to allow for the mischief of hisPirates of the Caribbeanturn, Depp still manages to embroider his role here with plenty of quirky business. He plays a writer, depressed and nearly divorced, who's stuck in an isolated cabin (shades ofThe Shining) when a stranger (John Turturro) arrives, accusing him of plagiarism. Writer-director David Koepp (Stir of Echoes) does his best to make the rickety material compelling--he gets the maximum out of the cabin set, for instance--but the problems inherent in the King story eventually win out. The climactic scenes are particularly unpleasant, especially in contrast to the cleverness of Depp's performance. A Philip Glass score adds class, but this one ultimately feels like a disappointment.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006JDU8", "B000NQRR1Q", "B00000IRE6", "B00005R87R", "B000F7CECK", "B002QEHPQU", "B00AEBBA72", "B00AEBBAEK", "B00AEBB9F0", "B006ISJQ1W", "B004A8ZWSS", "B004P7CNC2", "B001EZE5BU", "0780628551", "B0000VD04M", "B0000WN140", "0780621611", "B0009UZG0K", "B008QE9XD2", "B004SIP7PS", "B00004XPPB", "B00003CXWV", "B00092ZLSK", "B0000AC8LI", "B000053VAZ", "B000TJ6PBK", "B0007NFMB2", "B000N2HDJQ", "B00005UQ9V", "B001I04QCO", "B001HN69AY", "B001HN694K", "0792846443", "B004SIP6BI", "B000G1R39E", "B00003CXRG", "B0000C2IQQ", "B00AEBBA2W", "B000053UIF", "B006J8NPAE", "B000OYC7BW", "B00005JM5E", "0792841328", "0783229526", "6305120021", "B00C888MJ8", "B000GBEWRU", "0767821599", "B000BB1MI2", "B000FDEV3Y", "B00008EY9G", "B0002O7XW2", "B0009IOR6Q", "B00006FDCU", "B0053TWVDC", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00AEBB91E", "B0007WFXNA", "B00005JNY3", "B000U1ZV6W", "B00000F3SB", "B00005JN2Z", "0451213599", "B004SIP92O", "B000I0RQVI", "B00AEBB91O", "B00J5JSV3A", "B001A50716", "B000HT386M", "B00AEFYV9W", "1573625779", "1573626910", "B00F84H73Q", "B00AEBB8NI", "B000063US5", "B002NZK5SM", "B0010X73ZG", "B0002DB54A", "B00A1AU72A", "B00005JLQN", "B000C3L27U", "B005COPWZW", "B00009W5CA", "B0001GOH6Q", "630523650X", "B0002A2VK0", "B00AEFYYH6", "6305432317", "B00FYV7WCY", "B000GYI340", "B008R65Y28", "B000068IES", "B00005JNNT", "B000A2UBN4", "B0053TWV46", "B00011CZRE", "B0021L8UXA", "079284646X", "B00006FDCD"], "bought_together": ["B000NQRR1Q", "B00006JDU8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0012Q7M02", "B00AEBBAEK", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEBBA72"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 24136}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.99, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0002234LS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412W5xnNliL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Secret Window"}

{"description": "Almost by accident, these five Warner Brothers films represent key moments in Martin Scorsese's career. Three of the films debut on DVD; all have excellent presentations plus new commentaries from Scorsese. The black-and-whiteWho's That Knocking at My Door?(1968) was Scorsese's first film, an episodic tale of growing up in Little Italy.Mean Streets(1973) put him on the map. After taking a bit of Hollywood bait (Boxcar Bertha), mentor John Cassavetes put Scorsese straight to find his true vision, and this nervy look at New York friends who border the gangster life is the result. This new special edition has the commentary track and a big improvement in its home video presentation.Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore(1974) put Scorsese in the mainstream. This tale of a single mom (Ellen Burstyn in an Oscar-winning performance) finding second chances in the arid Southwest proved the New York City kid could tell other types of stories.After Hours(1985) saved Scorsese. The drain of big movies and his unsuccessful first attempt to makeThe Last Temptation of Christleft the auteur doubting his talent. The nightmarish comedy starting Griffin Dunne is a love-it-or-leave-it for many Scorsese fans, but the fast shoot schedule and claustrophobic story rejuvenated Scorsese and won him Best Director kudos at Cannes. The highlight of the collection is a two-disc edition of his masterpiece,GoodFellas(1990), complete with a remastered print and a dynamite commentary by several key talents (recorded separately) including Ray Liotta, author Nicholas Pileggi, and even Robert De Niro. Even with an extra disc of three featurettes, it's the film on which we hear the least from the man himself, but perhaps all we need to know is on the screen.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00062IVL2", "0767830555", "B00006RCNV", "B004O724M2", "B0002ZSKMS", "6305941122", "B000UJCAKO", "B0006GAOJA", "B000WC39ZY", "B001JQTSG6", "B000V3JGII", "B00BTYMPX6", "B000C20VPA", "B0031P77RU", "0307268403", "B007NYZA0Q", "B004499LWG", "B006TTC5MM", "B004IFYMYI", "6305090580", "B00005UM2Y", "B000035Z5G", "B000CNESUS", "B000HWZ4ES", "B00553K8FY", "B004SIP7TE", "B005EVY8MQ", "B0000DI87S", "B00008RH3J", "0571220029", "B005CA4SL0", "B000UVV25Q", "B00080ZG10", "B005KQVE1S", "B00005QAPH", "B002QEHPQ0", "B000A2UBN4", "B000M341QE", "B00005ASUK", "B0018CMJSU", "B00AEFXN9G", "B00003CWTI", "B0024FAG2Q", "B002T9H2LA", "B0007RTBA6", "B004SIP7US", "B000CNESTE", "B00005YKXQ", "B007TBJD1U", "6305999872", "B0011HOEZS", "B000A0GP4K", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00000F3CD", "B00AEBB9CS", "B003102JDM", "0783225903", "B000E40QC4", "B00005NC66", "B008220DGE", "B00005JKFX", "B001539HQY", "B002U6DVPS", "B003XTOBU0", "B000CNESU8", "B000SFJ4IQ", "B004FQX5B6", "B00009ME9Z", "B0001MDQ9E", "B00008975Z", "B001BEK8E2", "B001FOK70S", "B00F98FNNM", "B000BX0VRS", "B0002JP2OS", "B00AEBBA68", "B000244EWY", "B0024EWP6W", "B00005ATQB", "0226182037", "0307388794", "B000LP6KNU", "B0009S4IJM", "B003S6KGNY", "B00004XPPB", "B000E6ESXK", "B000286RNE", "B0070HKDMG", "B0000AZT2X", "B00004Y87O", "B000CEV3L4", "B001152TL6", "B006TTC5HC", "B001QFFBAM", "B002QFYJF4", "B00H9KKKAY", "B007D0FVRM", "B000E0OE1M", "B000E5LEV0", "B00005UQ7T"], "bought_together": ["0767830555"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0767830555", "B000P0J09M", "B0006GAOJA", "B000C20VPA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 31888}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 21.0, "brand": "SCORSESE,MARTIN", "asin": "B000286RR0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KybRrNkXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Martin Scorsese Collection (After Hours/Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore/Goodfellas/Mean Streets/Who's That Knocking At My Door?)"}
{"description": "Making no attempt at factual accuracy,Ned Kellyis still an engaging action film with its heart in the right place. You don't need to be a student of Australian history to know that a movie about the life of the notorious folk hero and outlaw is not going to be a light-hearted romp through the outback. Injustice, persecution, and unlawful imprisonment are the meat of his story, all presented here with not too much of a rose-tinted perspective amid generous doses of obligatory action.  Rebellious teenager Ned Kelly (Heath Ledger) is wrongfully imprisoned for stealing a horse and, when he returns to the bosom of his large Irish family, finds that the police won't let him go straight. After being accused of a crime he didn't commit, Kelly is left with no option but to go on the run. Accompanied by his gang (among them Orlando Bloom) he robs banks to survive and also to gather the money to free his family from prison. There is some considerable romanticizing of the story and the man himself, due in part to Ledger's affable Robin Hood-esque working-class hero portrayal. Bloom is wide-eyed and daring as Kelly's main man, and Naomi Watts as his married mistress has the thankless task of breaking up some great action sequences to play the unnecessary love interest.

{"description": "Based on the manga by Rumiko Takahashi, the creator ofRanma 1/2andUrusei Yatsura, theInu-YashaTV series (2000) blends elements of Japanese folklore and familiar anime devices into a deftly imaginative blend of humor and adventure, an extremely entertaining series that never falls into clich&#xE9;.  Beginning the first season's 27 episodes, Kagome Higurashi, a normal 15-year-old girl, falls down a dry well--and finds herself in the feudal past, 50 years after her ancestress Kikyo imprisoned the half-human/half-demon Inu-Yasha. As the reincarnation of Kikyo, Kagome possesses a magic jewel that greatly increases the power of demons. Kagome fetters Inu-Yasha with the help of her priestess-ancestor Kaede, and when the jewel is shattered Kagome and Inu-Yasha must ally to recapture the fragments.The series really begins to hit its stride when Kagome and Inu-Yasha, while bickering, nevertheless prove an effective team against the demons they encounter in the Warring States netherworld. Two new characters create complications. Shippo, an orphan fox spirit, meets Kagome and Inu-Yasha in the Warring States period. A more conventional but potentially more dangerous addition is Hojo, a handsome upper classman at Kagome's school, who's concerned about her recent absences. His understated good manners contrast sharply with the prickly Inu-Yasha--just as Kagome is beginning to recognize his good points.In the multi-part adventure that begins with \"Kikyo's Stolen Ashes,\" the filmmakers presenting conflicting versions of the relationship between Kikyo and Inu-Yasha, and the intriguing plot twists typify Takahashi's sophisticated story-telling. The tone darkens as the back story emerges: 50 years earlier, Kikyo tended Onigumo, a badly burned thief. As his desire for the Sacred Jewel--and Kikyo--grew, Onigumo summoned a horde of demons, whom he allowed to consume his flesh and soul. The evil creatures fused to form the terrible Naraku. Recognizing his feelings for Kagome, Inu-Yasha tries to protect her from Naraku by sending her back to her own time and blocking the passage between the ages. Inu-Yasha, Kagome, Shippo, and Miroku face a bizarre array of monsters and villains, including a forest demon who vomits hordes of monstrous, three-eyed wolves.As the tapestry grows richer, Kagome and Myoga begin to explore the origins and nature of the Sacred Jewel that radiates power yet brings misfortune to everyone who approaches it. The source of the jewel turns out to be the demon-slayers' village. Inu-Yasha, Kagome, and their friends learn how the Jewel was created long ago in a battle between hordes of monstrous demons and Midoriko, the greatest priestess of the age. But the Jewel is also a miniature battleground between good and evil: a metaphor for the world--and for Inu-Yasha's heart, as he vacillates between selfishness and kindness.

{"description": "Christian (Wes Ramsey of the washboard abs) is a waiter, party boy, and first-class man magnet. Elder Aaron Davis (Steve Sandvoss of the goofy grin) is a straight-laced Mormon missionary. When he and three elders, including the uptight Ryder (Joseph Gordon-Levitt,Mysterious Skin), move into Christian's Hollywood apartment complex, it's clear something's got to give.  Christian tries to make his new neighbors feel welcome, but they're put off by his flamboyance--the short-shorts, the rainbow flag in his yard, etc.  When Christian's trash-talking pals at Lila's restaurant, including the cynical Traci (Amber Benson,Buffy the Vampire Slayer), bet that he can't seduce one of these clean-cut young men, he takes them up on it and sets his sights on cute, soft-spoken Aaron. As a pretense, he asks to learn more about his Church, but where they really connect is over their love of old movies, everything fromPsychotoTommy. When Aaron accuses him of being shallow, however, Christian starts to wonder if the bet wasn't such a good idea--plus he's starting to fall for the guy. Turns out the closeted Aaron feels the same way about him, but when his roommates find out, he's shipped back to Pocatello where he faces excommunication. Written and directed by C. Jay Cox (Sweet Home Alabama), a former Mormon missionary,Latter Daysfeatures Mary Kay Place as Aaron's disapproving mother and Jacqueline Bisset as the acerbic, yet supportive Lila.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Andy Goldsworthy's Rivers and Tidesis a truly beautiful, Scottish-German 2001 documentary about artist Goldsworthy, a Scotsman whose medium is nature itself and whose preferred studio is the outdoors, particularly where water forever flows, rises, and/or retreats. The soft-spoken, secluded Goldsworthy is seen hard at work making ephemeral sculptures out of bits of ice in the trees, or building tall, mysterious cones from loose rock, which stand like spiritual sentinels in forests and on shorelines, overgrown by plants or swallowed daily by high tides. Filmmaker-cinematographer Thomas Reidelsheimer goes to great and sometimes inexplicable lengths to make visual corollaries to Goldsworthy's ideas about underappreciated relationships between light, color, movement, balance, and fluidity of form in the real world, makingRivers and Tidesa lively and always surprising cinematic gallery. Some of Goldsworthy's most miraculous natural installations--stone walls that snake through hundreds of feet of forest and stream, for instance--show up in the last half-hour.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["0810933519", "0810971461", "B004CJQVQC", "0810939924", "0810955865", "B00008PHD1", "B000R2GDOS", "B002NWRMO0", "B003ELMR80", "0810938472", "B00BFWKE76", "0810991802", "0810993910", "0810944820", "B008BWFP18", "B0051URXWM", "B002PX446G", "B003BR8MDQ", "B0087HDEGA", "B009B8YZ8U", "B0077PBPNM", "B00470MG06", "B002ZMZBIM", "B001CQS7LU", "0810906244", "B0031REQG8", "B0081NAUK8", "B002KLALEC", "1568989768", "B0013UQUQE", "B0062Z0PBQ", "B000F0UUSM", "B0000TPAQA", "B003VZNAVC", "B001CK7OM4", "0500238715", "B004SIP7S0", "B000BITUFM", "B000NVI0EY", "B00005KHJJ", "3791370995", "3791347594", "0740769340", "B001E5FYS8", "B009MBSWBW", "B0000C825I", "B003MWHUMY", "0810919931", "B001C71IEM", "B005YFGJ8S", "B003VTKZ8O", "190546472X", "B003M987AG", "B00003TKZB", "B003ELMR8U", "1419700960", "B002LC3M8M", "B004RV719G", "1602377359", "1452117101", "B009RWRIKM", "0792299957", "B000GEIREQ", "B000HLDF0O", "B001ULAUEE", "B000CGX7G6", "B002VBQEEW", "3791345303", "B001BWYT4E", "B0000DG012", "B0006Q93EM", "0714865516", "B0031REQKE", "B000A7DVZO", "B000BITUH0", "B003AWEZ74", "0979757541", "1883220734", "B0009PVZEG", "0714865281", "B00BCV3IN2", "3791370103", "0674008022", "0807749761", "B004ULEEQG", "B001CDLAT4", "3037781262", "B0087IT8FK", "081170601X", "B0087OULO6", "B00EL6AAEU", "B0002J4X20", "B00CORM1MW", "1442446897", "B00006CXGZ", "076117897X", "1619021528", "0486203263", "B000BI5KUQ"], "bought_together": ["0810933519", "0810971461"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0810933519", "0810971461", "0810955865", "B004CJQVQC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22621}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 16.32, "brand": "Gaiam", "asin": "B0002JL9N6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51A2F0PTZ8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Andy Goldsworthy's Rivers &amp; Tides"}

{"description": "When a movie can blend passionate social concern with good old-fashioned suspense, it must be doing something right.Maria Full of Gracescores high on both counts. Maria is a Colombian teenager who, for a large paycheck, agrees to be a mule for drug-runners:  she has to swallow dozens of thumb-sized capsules of heroin and smuggle them into New York. This debilitating process is painstakingly described, and of course not everything goes as planned when Maria and her fellow mules land in America. Director Joshua Marston is working on a low budget, which explains the film's narrow, single-minded focus--but this may be a strength, not a weakness. The trump card is the lead performance of Catalina Sandrino Moreno, who won awards at the Seattle and Newport Film Festivals. Her empathetic face carries us along on Maria's journey, and humanizes a problem that is too easily relegated to a headline.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002FHGESI", "B00005JNCZ", "B0041KKYF6", "B000N3T0DW", "B00080Z53O", "B000O76ZQC", "B00005N8A9", "B00180IPM6", "B00008AOX5", "B0036TGSJE", "B008S2NABI", "B000YIGNCC", "B0007NBJHI", "B0042EJDGM", "B000RHRGSK", "B00AZMFKXK", "B005HFI7IU", "B000LV6OC6", "B00005JL57", "B0015ET3YO", "B003A0T8BO", "B004XVMCMG", "B000WC38IC", "B002M2T1VI", "B000N3SU6K", "B001ILTUKQ", "B0052LE7C4", "B005FIXA6S", "B002E01LOI", "B00GJNQ3S0", "B0047685T6", "B00075VX2C", "B00005JLQW", "B000AM4P90", "B001UV4XC4", "B004SIP7S0", "B00006G8G3", "B004SIP6GI", "B00005LZOD", "B0011FLH14", "B004MNM1FI", "B002M2T1V8", "B0086900LG", "B002BWP3UC", "B00E5G03KM", "B000AYEIDQ", "B00134PSV8", "B001FOPOD8", "B0000AMU29", "B00003CXRG", "B0014BQR6U", "B000274TLW", "B000LXHFMW", "B0000C9JFO", "B0001CNQX0", "B00004U1FA", "B00E1S1MMM", "B007961SAE", "B000GETTJI", "B004IF4EVY", "B00F6Y3E26", "B0032AJVE6", "B003O3EKRO", "B003X3BYJM", "B0009HLC9W", "B0000714BS", "B00000F5KH", "B002VECLXC", "B0000714BQ", "B0009S4IGK", "B002FUI4CE", "B00006BS7S", "B00APUAKYG", "B000K2V7F0", "B000SLYE6M", "0764146076", "B0000A2ZTY", "B0002VEZ3U", "1444137697", "B001M5BF7Y", "B000KJU15U", "B001Q56XOA", "B001QX014A", "0070020698", "B001S400C0", "B000VXUW0E", "B00H1RMPH6", "B000QYKDFC", "B000067IZ3", "B000JBXH78", "B00IQIAL8Y", "B007L6VPXC", "B0051T46YG", "B0002DRDIW", "B002EZLPOO", "B000N3T0DM", "B0002RQ316", "B0000U0X20", "B0013HL6ES"], "bought_together": ["B000O76ZQC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00180IPM6", "B0036TGSJE", "B005HFI7IU", "B000O76ZQC"]}, "price": 4.09, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3577}, "asin": "B0002TT0MI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51o4PdGtr3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Maria Full of Grace"}

{"description": "The beautiful and wonderfully named Giovanna Mezzogiorno joins the list of soulful Italian actresses withFacing Windows, a pleasant cinematic fancy. Her character is a married Mom in an ordinary apartment, whose life is affected by two things:  her fascination with the handsome man who lives across the courtyard, and the sudden arrival in her home of an elderly amnesiac (played by the late Massimo Girotti)--a well-dressed man found walking on the street, dazed and lost. Turkish-born director Ferzan Ozpetek (Steam: The Turkish Bath) makes this simultaneously a slice of life and a vaguely fantastical situation. It probably all works out a little too neatly, but the unhurried pace and deep sympathy Ozpetek displays toward his main characters is refreshing. And when in doubt, he points the camera at the face of La Mezzogiorno, which solves all problems.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000C1VB8M", "B00598OA2C", "B000FUF6SQ", "B0000C23T0", "B004P0IRHE", "B003U4H0CE", "B0018O50VG", "B00CTHOEV8", "B004XVMCLW", "B003JHXS8C", "B0006JMLVQ", "B00003CXXY", "B000I0RNV6", "B000CR8QV6", "B00HRJVHEK", "B005P2BLC4", "B000FWHW68", "B00AIXVV9I", "B003IISTD6", "B001B94K3W", "B0026IQTQS", "B000ELJA6U", "B007AFBYTO", "B00006ADG1", "B00HE010QM", "B0043CT9E4", "B002JTMNZ0", "B004R4PWYY", "B0019X3YT6", "B005GP7F5W", "B00124SNIO", "B00124SNIY", "B0011FLH14", "B00005JMIJ", "B0000AEUJA", "B000NY1EAS", "B000X418UY", "B00HHYF5EI", "B004XVMCKI", "B000ARXG0E", "B008B9JSD2", "B004D45NZG", "B00GWWV1XU", "B000E40PYS", "B000E33W0I", "B00006LPER", "B0040BJH2M", "B002VECLXC", "6305081034", "B000B58DI0", "B006IW8E3Y", "B000MRNWFQ", "B001DB6J82", "B0000DZ3BJ", "B00009ME9Z", "B008A1AKK6", "B0064NLRG8", "B002M2T1VI", "B00007KQ9X", "B00005Y6XU", "B000021Y77", "B004KDYR2A", "B003OXSRW8", "B002TZS5GA", "B0002DB4YQ", "B005STGM1O", "B00005JLQW", "B004MOJW0E", "B000EQ5Q2W", "B0045ZAQSM", "B000FSMEE2", "B00008976W", "B004L03B3S", "B00005QFE6", "B001CIOCLC", "B002ONC9NC", "B005V4X8PO", "B00996RSYM", "B0000CE684", "B00B2DGYQS", "B000274TLW", "B0033PQUXA", "B0006J27WO", "B0036TGSJE", "B0002JZT5A", "B008KJVKPW", "B0016GIAJ0", "B001EASNTK", "0139536396", "B00009IB5B", "B0048LPRDW", "B0007OP1YE", "B000087EYH", "B000ERVKOE", "B004RCC6XG", "B001ABRBHI", "B00008PBYZ", "B000EMGF26", "B0002TT08W", "B0006ZW6VU"], "bought_together": ["B000FUF6SQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FUF6SQ", "B004XVMCLW", "B00598OA2C", "B003U4H0CE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 120895}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 20.39, "brand": "", "asin": "B0002XNSYU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516D4Y79P2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Facing Windows"}

{"description": "Part family comedy and part horrifying investigative reportage,Blue Vinylcan make one simultaneously laugh and shiver with fear in the same, deceptively low-key moments. Documentary filmmaker Judith Helfand, upset that her parents are re-siding their house with blue vinyl, sets out (with co-director Daniel B. Gold) to discover how vinyl is made and why, according to some scientists, it is the most hazardous of synthetic materials. Along the way, she meets industry representatives who tell her the key chemical ingredient in vinyl, chloride, is no more toxic than table salt. She also travels to Venice, Italy, to meet with families of vinyl factory workers dead or dying from chemical exposure, and she visits an intrepid, Louisiana attorney who has sued American vinyl manufacturers on behalf of severely injured former employees. The tale is grim, yet the often on-screen Helfand's approach is folksy and calm--less so when her skeptical parents reject, in several funny scenes, even empirical data about a product they find so convenient.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0042EJD8A", "B000I5Y8FU", "B00005JPXA", "B001MWGZ6S", "B00EL6AAEU", "B000TRH4CQ", "B003M987AG", "B00D8NTEP8", "B000UNYJXQ", "B000MR9D5E", "B00A3TFOO0", "0917011023"], "bought_together": ["B0042EJD8A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00366E1AK"]}, "price": 16.86, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 219240}, "asin": "B0006212H2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VNJYD8ZRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blue Vinyl: The World's First Toxic Comedy"}

{"description": "Frasier's fourth season was mostly about relationships.  Niles (David Hyde Pierce), now separated from Maris, is back on the market like his bachelor brother, Frasier (Kelsey Grammer).  That's great when the pair goes to a cabin with a pair of fetching women (Megan Mullaly, later ofWill and Grace, and Lisa Darr), but Niles is never able to completely dispel his attachment to his suffocating wife... or to Daphne (Jane Leeves).  His obsession with the latter gets an immediate burst in the season's first episode, in which he has to masquerade as Daphne's husband, then later comes to a head when she appears at his apartment door asking to stay the night.  The boys have the usual disputes with their father (John Mahoney), including their disdain for the former cop's new girlfriend, Sherry (Marsha Mason), the boisterous, banjo-twangin', \"gotcha\"-playing bartender who would remain a regular cast member through the end of the series. Ex-wife Lilith (Bebe Neuwirth) makes her annual appearance, this time when she and Frasier try to get Frederick into an exclusive prep school.  And the title character?  As much as Frasier teases his producer Roz (Peri Gilpin) about her dating habits, he himself is lonely, leading him to a memorable airport encounter with guest star Linda Hamilton and a season finale that proves a kind of a harbinger to the series' final episode.  This season madeFrasiera perfect four-for-four at the Emmys, winning its fourth consecutive award for Outstanding Comedy Series.  Unlike previous seasons, this DVD set has no bonus features.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007Y08RY", "B0001NBNJ8", "B000A0GOQY", "B000B5XOUC", "B000ERVJMW", "B000MX7V5W", "B000VDDE0Y", "B0002WZTLQ", "B006OKOWUY", "B0001NBNIY", "B000A0GOQ4", "B0006IUDYY", "B0000E32X2", "B0019F02W6", "B000ERVJMM", "B0007Y08JW", "B001HUHBAY", "B0012EM5EC", "B000B5XOTS", "B00008NV4G", "B00080Z5FM", "B00K8HAJN8", "B006MFQ4DE", "B000C1VBAA", "B000A7PKGW", "B000I2J6VE", "B000KGGIL4", "B0019D151K", "B007C8RZYC", "B00BTFK01Y", "B000EBGFQI", "B00GHH9HW2", "B001FB4VXU", "B0007KTBJO", "B0002W4SWW", "B000AJJNJK", "B007C8RZQ0", "B000BNTM46", "B0013D8M3U", "B000AJJNIQ", "B000GETU2E", "B0012EM5EW", "B001BNFR6M", "B001JAHSKU", "B000BGR1AK", "B000GRUMQY", "B005M5OSBU", "B008LCRA98", "B0002W4SX6", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B007C8RZL0", "B0001K5GOO", "B001NY4X3W", "B002E58FT2", "B000TD4N9W", "B0006N2EZK", "B0009UC7MK", "B000BKVKSA", "B000RO6JZE", "B00GOC74I4", "B000EWBKM6", "B00HNGC56G", "B000USU9P8", "B000BYRCF6", "B002N5N4M6", "B0007R4SWC", "B0007US79Y", "B0006N2EZA", "B00FM4S7P4", "B009LDD1X0", "B00008979F", "B00005JLEX", "B0045HCIWW", "0783225547", "B002JVWQUU", "B00C81AWAM", "B003TNW04Y", "B002OOWL3Y", "B0006Q93BU", "B000W91RUG", "B0002NY8R6", "B007MMIMSQ", "B002N8WLYK", "B001O4KBO6", "B0007Y08P6", "B006OS1BCI", "B002E58FUG", "B005IA9JRM", "B00IFK7OFG", "B0002CX21K", "B001OXLGK0", "B002OOWKYE", "B00B04NIOU", "B0002NY8PI", "B000209KMW", "B000VDDE18", "B000K7UBXE", "B001MVYUSO"], "bought_together": ["B0001NBNJ8", "B0007Y08RY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001NBNJ8", "B000VDDE18", "B0007Y08RY", "B000B5XOUC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7850}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 18.19, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B0006Q93AQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FNZV886QL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Frasier: Season 4"}

{"description": "By getting nominated for Academy Awards in both the Foreign Language Film and Best Song categories,Les Choristes(The Chorus) made a rare (for a European film) double impression at the 2004 Oscars. This sentimental tale follows the arrival of a new teacher at a remote boys school in 1949 France (the war is a largely unspoken but ghostly presence). With disciplinary problems rampant, and the policies of the old-fashioned headmaster not helping, Monsieur Mathieu decides to introduce choral singing as a way to bridge the gap with his students. You don't need a crystal ball to figure out where this will go, although the movie uses its atmospheric location and lush vocal arrangements well. Bald, dumpy Gerard Jugnot provides a refreshingly offbeat hero (though securely in the traditions of the My Most Memorable Teacher movie); he's sort of a younger Philippe Noiret. Director Christophe Barratier works in the winsome-cute mode that makes a certain kind of French movie into an overly sweet bon bon, although at least this bon bon sings.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00421IR5I", "B002AG2NTI", "B001THZAAI", "B0002S64SM", "B0087IT8FK", "B008A6QBZO", "B0009P7EI2", "B000296E7W", "B0009NSAF0", "B001AZJKKK", "B0069UV0AY", "B000I6BJ56", "B009CSVQ8Q", "B007I1Q59E", "B001CIOCLC", "B0000C9JFO", "B004SEUIXS", "B005V4X8PO", "B000YPUFBA", "B0000A1HQP", "B002LE8MGW", "B000UAE7MM", "B005HISOJ4", "B00005JPX8", "B000B58DHQ", "B004Y2SDX6", "B0000YEENU", "B00005JM48", "B0084O26SI", "B0007OMJPI", "B002W1HBM0", "B000SSQ7JC", "B00005OSLQ", "B004B3254Q", "B0089MUDM6", "B005CKW8BM", "B0007Z9QSA", "B000UVV26A", "B008H1Q3QY", "B0012Z361M", "B0002TSZMO", "B000I0RNV6", "B004YCKKIM", "B000053VBR", "B0049BKOIY", "B004ZBFRRG", "B0007Z0NYQ", "B004GFGUAE", "B0007A61K6", "B00L16P1I8", "B00AIBZLHS", "B000HIVIQU", "B00A92MEJY", "B00DNB1OSU", "B002VKB0M4", "B00ENMZK1A", "B002AG2NV6", "B00007J5VT", "B000MTEFP0", "B0002RQ316", "B000053VBN", "B003Y7D7BU", "B009NP1ZVG", "B000CSUNRU", "B0045NXMMQ", "B003H0ZHGM", "B0036TGSJE", "B0001BMLUA", "B002SF9YNO", "B00447851Q", "B004XVMCGW", "B0001IN0MQ", "B004UXUUDA", "B001APM44O", "B0009PBLU4", "B000YAA68W", "B00023GG6C", "B00G15MDI0", "B002AG2NU2", "0156013983", "B000HRMCUM", "B00782O7IY", "B001CQS7M4", "B00AWHDFLW", "B00005N89H", "B004JNZGFI", "B00F6SHGF8", "B00007KK52", "B00AEFY9RG", "B0019APR80", "B005S9EK5Y", "B000065R0U", "B008KQVGEU", "B00ATK0452", "B0019UGYAU", "B004ZG5EYC", "B00CXI8HMK", "B004SUDQ2W", "6305428352"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00421IR5I", "B001THZAAI", "B0087IT8FK", "B0002S64SM"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 72019}, "asin": "B0007NMJPO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61HKVBYA0WL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Chorus (Les Choristes)"}
{"description": "From two-time Academy Award(r)-winner Pedro Almodovar (2002 Best Original Screenplay, Talk to Her, 2000 Best Foreign Language Film, All About My Mother) comes BAD EDUCATION, an outrageous tale of desire, revenge and murder. Filmmaker Enrique (Fele Mart&#xED;nez) gets a visit from an aspiring actor claiming to be his old school friend Ignacio (Gael Garcia Bernal, The Motorcycle Diaries, Y Tu Mama Tambien), who has written a story about their traumatic childhood spent at Catholic school. In the story, adrag performer known as Zahara (also played by Bernal) attempts to blackmail a predatory priest by exposing their scandalous past.

{"description": "Au hazard Balthazarcan have a profoundly moving effect on those who are sensitive to its power. Like any film by Robert Bresson, it provokes widely different responses: Many critics have hailed it as a masterpiece, while others (as Pauline Kael observed) \"may find it painstakingly tedious and offensively holy.\" It all depends on what the viewer brings to Bresson's seemingly simple tale of a donkey named Balthazar, who experiences kindness and cruelty as he is passed from owner to owner. Populated by a variety of sinners and saints alike, the film can be seen as a simple animal fable, as Balthazar suffers nobly at the hands of his handlers. Dig deeper into Bresson's art, however, and you're likely to find a very Catholic story with strong parallels to the life of Christ and his unbearable burden of the sins of mankind.No matter how you approach the film, only the most cold-hearted viewer will be immune to Balthazar's fate. And if you're not sure what to make of it all, this superb Criterion DVD offers two essential bonus features to guide you toward a greater understanding of Bresson's approach to cinema: Film scholar and devoted \"Bressonian\" Donald Richie offers his astute observations in a 2004 video interview, and in an in-depth French TV appearance from 1966, Bresson talks at length aboutAu hazard Balthazaralong with fellow directors Louis Malle and Jean-Luc Godard, and members of the film's cast and crew. This is a remarkable document from a bygone era, when \"art film\" was at its peak, and directors (especially French ones) were eager to discuss the intellectual significance of their work. Kudos to Criterion for including this archival gem of film appreciation.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BB14IA", "B000K0YLX2", "B00AQ6J6H6", "B001LMU19G", "0780022343", "B000087EY6", "6305257450", "6305744114", "B008DL4K8Q", "B00005M2C7", "B005152C7S", "B000127IF2", "B00AQ6J3AG", "B000C8Q900", "B00005JLV7", "B00EO2I6W4", "B009VO9XSG", "B001TIQT7A", "B00HE011DE", "B0007989Y8", "B000I8OOG0", "B0007OC6ZG", "B00005BHW6", "B001UF5KOU", "B0000A02TX", "B001TIQT6G", "B00GA9F2PI", "B00CUKTHJ8", "B009RWRIMA", "B0016AKSOG", "B000BB14I0", "B000N2HBIO", "B006X96PBU", "B00005UQ7T", "B000093NR0", "B00HVOFP6W", "B00005EBSF", "B00009ME9Z", "B005HK13S6", "B000BR6QIW", "B00BX49B0C", "B000AQKUG8", "B00180R06I", "B00KE3B6NI", "B001BEK8C4", "B004WPYO7E", "B00DHN8GQ2", "B00KE3B6LA", "B001LMU1C8", "B000E5LEV0", "B005152CC8", "6305131104", "B0001GH5RY", "B001ILTUKG", "B0016B6ZEC", "B002BWP4A6", "B001298BPY", "B000C8Q8ZQ", "B002U6DVQ2", "B007A9EGB8", "B00005NC66", "B004NWPY20", "B00000F7E6", "B001BEK8CE", "B00GBT629C", "B00DZP1C3Q", "B000PKG6O4", "B00A8QDHYW", "6305081034", "B002AFX53C", "B001LMU1B4", "B00HVOFP08", "B00004Z1FM", "B000EOTWIS", "B005HK13OK", "B00DZP1BUU", "B0035G5IOE", "B000M2E3GS", "B004CGUC10", "B00005QAPH", "B00005QAPJ", "B007A9EGC2", "B001WLMOL4", "B000IHYXH6", "B0000633SD", "B000HKH0WY", "B000FUF7CQ", "B000XQ4HQO", "B00JGR3M26", "B004NWPY34", "B00L3ZB7PS", "B00023P4N8", "B008CJ0JS4", "B00003CXUM", "B00GG0NABE", "B0007989ZC", "B001IZNIV4", "B005VU9LP4", "B000093NQY", "0292776241"], "bought_together": ["B000BB14IA", "B000K0YLX2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001EOQCJE", "6305428239", "B001QOGYBI", "B0000640VJ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 88549}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 20.17, "brand": "WIAZEMSKY,ANNE", "asin": "B00092ZLEY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41MLI-OZspL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Au Hasard Balthazar (The Criterion Collection)"}
{"description": "Driven by intelligent, constantly surprising and moving performances from the film's leads,Dear Frankiestars Emily Mortimer (Lovely and Amazing) as Lizzie, Scottish mother of Frankie (Jack McElhone), a deaf and highly intelligent 9-year-old. Constantly uprooting themselves and relocating from town to town, Lizzie and Frankie are on the run from the latter's abusive father, a fact unknown to the boy, who believes his dad is a busy seaman sending letters full of adventure and love. In fact, Lizzie is writing those missives, but she is faced with a challenge when Frankie discovers his father's ship will dock nearby. Lizzie hires a kind, handsome stranger (Gerard Butler) to play Frankie's dad, creating an odd situation in which ever-growing lies become a conduit for love, and Lizzie's repressed desires come to the fore with a man posing as her husband. The moral tangles are of interest in director Shona Auerbach's charmingly paced, quietly insightful drama-comedy, but so is the glorious feeling of watching these characters come fully alive.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00A2H9UG6", "B000GIXEIG", "B005FITIDC", "B00027NVXE", "B00007AJF4", "B000WP07F6", "B002ZG998G", "B002P413IC", "B000G8P1Y6", "B000YAA68C", "B000V8VNUM", "B00AEBB8QK", "B001M4YZ90", "B0059XTUR2", "B00AAQHP66", "B00003CXSD", "B001D7WF98", "B002XMGGK6", "B002SG7Z7A", "B004R6VHQY", "B004XYOQU4", "B001APZMJS", "B00009XN4C", "B00AEFYGBA", "B000FQISV2", "B00094AS9U", "B0007TKNII", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00BEIYHO2", "B00946G2YE", "B000OY9V8Y", "B00A2H9VBU", "B005FITIF0", "B003LL3FIY", "B000811672", "B00006JDVV", "B00008DDVT", "B005CFC0HE", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B000XS3WWW", "B004IY6A0S", "B00GPWEPZ8", "B00G15MDI0", "B00CBK6506", "B001APZMJ8", "B00006JU8B", "B000QXDED6", "B004SIP7PS", "B0000714BW", "B007A2O3FO", "B007K7IBTI", "B003HDYOTU", "B000GYI048", "B0000C2IR4", "B0009A1BW2", "B000A2W1X2", "B0015GDVTU", "B000NJWIPI", "0767020308", "B0009UZGIM", "B003SC9AVC", "B00EOHGQPI", "B00AQTY3XA", "B000654YWY", "B00AZMFO6I", "B000NVT0T8", "B002OVED88", "B0009G3BCY", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B0059XTUT0", "B0067EKY7M", "B00006ZXSO", "B0000UJLTG", "B0053Q9DHW", "B0002W18RU", "B00G7QPXAI", "B000HRMATU", "B00DL48BM6", "B00G6HO368", "B004SIP6BI", "B00BEIYGK2", "B000Z27HLS", "B002ZG988M", "B00104AYFQ", "B0040J1RZE", "B005S9EJ14", "B000P5FH26", "B000JLQQ7Q", "B00005JPSM", "B005PTMPYA", "B00GST8LMG", "B004KDYQXU", "B008N25XAE", "B000VKL6T8", "6305558205", "B0002V7S34", "B00008HC9B", "B000IJ7A24", "B00JAQJMJ0"], "bought_together": ["B00A2H9UG6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007TKNII", "B00A2H9UG6", "B001APZMJS", "B000YAA68C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17921}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.14, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00094AS9A", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51igVNYqynL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dear Frankie"}
{"description": "The drama was poured on aplenty in the second season ofThe O.C., as the sun-dappled denizens of Orange County found their lives massively upended and then some. At the end of the first season, the Cohen household had been reduced to two--parents Sandy and Kirsten (Peter Gallagher and Kelly Rowan)--as the boys had flown the coop, moody Ryan (Benjamin McKenzie) back to Chino and goofy Seth (Adam Brody) for the wide expanse of the Pacific (somehow ending up in Portland, Oregon). Once the prodigal sons returned home, thanks to a lot of persuading, both tried to mend relationships with their former girlfriends, Marissa (Mischa Barton) and Summer (Rachel Bilson). While friendships were solidified, everyone was dating someone else: Seth was with sultry club manager Alex (Olivia Wilde), Summer with sensitive polo jock Zach (Michael Cassidy), Ryan with smart girl Lindsay (Shannon Lucio), and Marissa with her family's pool guy and a bottle of vodka.That's just the first half of this year ofThe O.C., and we haven't even gotten to the adults yet. Both Sandy and Kirsten found themselves tempted away by more-than-willing suitors, and wicked Julie (Melinda Clarke), Marissa's mom, cheated on new husband Caleb (Alan Dale) with ex-husband Jimmy (Tate Donovan). An extremely tangled web was woven, one from which the show almost didn't recover: the Lindsay storyline started out strong but went nowhere, Sandy's ex-girlfriend (Kim Delaney) was a bit of a bore, and the same-sex relationship between Marissa and Alex never really gelled. All seemed like sure-fire character additions, but it was the later peripheral characters, including Billy Campbell as a magazine editor smitten with Kirsten and the menacing yet sexy Logan Marshall-Green as Ryan's ex-con brother, who injectedThe O.C.with energy, and helped steer the show back on course. Brody, who became the show's de facto poster boy, got to show off his comedic talents with the wonderful Bilson (who rode the Zach-Seth-Summer romantic triangle most smoothly), and the heretofore sullen McKenzie got to lighten up quite a bit, until the show's violent yet effective season finale.Forsaking a good amount of its comedy for drama,The O.C.got a little too seriously soapy, but its characters were so compelling you couldn't stop watching--even waiflike Marissa grew some edges. Clarke's scheming Julie was a constant pleasure to watch, and Rowan turned Kirsten's late-season downturn into a steely yet heartfelt portrayal. Despite the bumps,The O.C.remained one of the most exciting shows to look forward to week after week, a soap with smarts thanks to its fresh dialogue, gifted cast, and careening plot arcs.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000GYI32M", "B0002V7TZQ", "B0050MB5P2", "B002BAW6HW", "B0006FFRBG", "B002BAW6I6", "B000NA1PUG", "B000F9T70U", "B000H7JCG4", "B001G0MFD8", "B002JVWRB8", "B0012BS5XU", "B003L77GEM", "B00008AOX3", "B0000E5NPY", "B0002234R2", "B001EWDXT8", "B0009CTVLS", "B001MVWMIO", "B003R0MF7G", "B000NOKFGW", "B003FSTN4S", "B001ILFUB4", "B000KLQULW", "B002HK9IMW", "B000PY4ZBQ", "B000BM7Z3C", "B0017VG68G", "B0000524E5", "B00BGQ2NIO", "B001EO5NUI", "B0077PTWY6", "B0011UBDS6", "B0007QMS20", "B005CGI3ZG", "B003L77G56", "B00BGQ2NDO", "B0077PTWHI", "B003L77GFG", "B00447L4KA", "B00AOCZOLO", "B005FISC52", "B00EYRWVPC", "B00079FUI6", "B008FTX6MM", "B00AEFY5ZC", "B0019CSXAM", "B00363WGGO", "B000FIMG4U", "B002BJGYTY", "B000HT3P7E", "B00BT1XCOU", "B000KGH00W", "B0001CCXZW", "B0024FAR6Q", "B005IA9JVI", "B00DRSGQ7I", "B0053O89Z6", "B000P6YNSO", "B00A8KJN8M", "B000FVQLIO", "B004SIP95G", "B001OD4S50", "B003R0MEW2", "B002IT6X4S", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B00684J49U", "B00CWIMVDW", "0385737947", "B009AMAL1W", "B0058YPGL6", "B009RX85N0", "006228701X", "B00ED2IBXE", "B005G4FFBE", "B006DHAT5K", "B00EJ1IY4K", "B00BEIYMZ6", "B003Y5H5B0", "B00E8RKHWW"], "bought_together": ["B0002V7TZQ", "B000GYI32M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002V7TZQ", "B000GYI32M", "B000UJ48O0", "B0050MB5P2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 4697}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B0009K7QZ8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/617sedRP9BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The O.C.: Season 2"}

{"description": "Eerie and elliptical,Sorumslowly builds an atmosphere of psychological disintegration. A taxi driver with a Bruce Lee obsession named Yong-hyun (Myeong-min Kim) moves into a decaying apartment building and learns that his apartment was the site of both a recent mysterious death as well as a murder from 30 years earlier. When an abused woman down the hall named Sun-yeong (Jin-Young Jang) asks for his help, they step down a path that will gradually reveal secrets of hers, of his, and of the building itself. Though there are jolting moments of sex and violence, most ofSorumis simple and still: Sun-yeong standing at the doorway of the convenience store where she works, Yong-hyun wandering down the long hallways of the building, the two of them sharing hot dumplings, pages of a book flipping in a draft. But though there's not much to satisfy those who like their horror with lots of gore, this slippery but elegant movie will creep under the skin of more patient viewers. The extras are minimal, including a peculiarly uninformative making-of documentary and movie trailers, one of which features some intriguing footage that's not in the final film.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B000TGUUEQ", "B000NA28GG", "B000NO243E", "B000MM0LH8", "B004ZKNBXE", "B000E3LGMY", "B000C65YMQ", "B000FZEQVY", "B000GSYRY6", "B000FZEQW8", "B0009A40PC", "B000H5U5YY", "B000FVQYW2", "B000BVM240", "B0007UVXCC", "B00GXG5KLY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00104AYG0", "B0007XBM8O", "B000ARXG68", "B000BVM240"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 431747}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.4, "brand": "", "asin": "B0009NCQKU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513HK7X701L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sorum"}
{"description": "Once a series has broken new ground, where does it go from there? Showtime'sThe L Word, concerning the relationships of a community of lesbian Los Angelenos, turned heads with its smart, funny writing and fully realized characters. Season Two offers more of the same, with some notable guest stars and experiments in narrative and music. This season, Jenny (Mia Kirshner) fully embraces her sexuality as her ex-husband/roomie (Eric Mabius) departs and voyeuristic documentary filmmaker Mark (Eric Lively) and womanchaser Shane (Katherine Moennig) move in. Shane and Jenny struggle good-heartedly over the affections of new character Carmen (Sarah Shahi), who isn't given much to do plot-wise apart from occasionally spinning records and serving as one corner of the love triangle. Bette (Jennifer Beals) and Tina (Laurel Holloman) start the season on the rocks due to Bette's infidelity; the introduction of the one-dimensionally nasty Helena Peabody (Rachel Shelley) causes further friction between Bette and Tina while playing havoc with Bette's curatorial career. Meanwhile, Dana (Erin Daniels) and Alice (Leisha Hailey) go from being best friends to being a whole lot more, providing some of the most touching scenes of the season. Kit (Pam Grier) takes on The Planet, the seeming center of LA's lesbian universe, converting it into a nightclub where, conveniently, guest-starring bands can play.Strong points of the season include Bette and Kit confronting the death of their father (the superb Ossie Davis) and Shane's new job as a gopher for a high-powered Hollywood producer (the equally superb Camryn Manheim). Less strong are the distracting, neo-expressionistic passages meant to be glimpses into Jenny's creative mind and the interminable use of the series' theme song--re-interpreted in a number of genres--to the point of distraction. Mark's voyeurism, which crosses all sorts of boundaries as he installs hidden cameras around the house, is a brilliant way to challenge male viewers who may tune in just to TiVo their way to the sex scenes. That said, the arc of that particular story grows increasingly far-fetched as Mark somehow avoids criminal prosecution and instead endures the horrible fate of having Jenny refuse his offer of coffee and a muffin. Despite its flaws,The L Wordis a show that deserves to be cheered on, not for its politics, but for the skillful way it conveys complex human entanglements with sensitivity.--Ryan Boudinot", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002MPQRS", "B000GTJSO4", "B000TGJ8D0", "B001BN4WMC", "B001G0MFOM", "B00002CGGH", "B000F7CEBG", "B000J4QWIG", "B003YJFALI", "B0001HAGSI", "B0000V46D6", "B002SF9YTS", "B00005QW5T", "B00009MEB8", "B00AFDN5Y0", "B004BJMEO6", "B008XAGN46", "B00HW3EXCE", "0743291336", "B0000798EY", "B00006RJ97", "B001AQBGM4", "B003L77GTC", "B00166UFSY", "B000OVLC0W", "B00CKJJ1G8", "B000Q6GUKW", "B0019Z3P84", "B00005RIY5", "B004YM6JSW", "B00008AOX3", "B0007DBJG4", "B0013LRKUS", "B00827OWO8", "B009TE9GNK", "B00GPPXNIK", "B00J49R0ZQ", "B00005JO9J", "B000EHSV5K", "B007PKSO2Y", "B00023P4M4", "B00FRTAZEA", "B00BI9VRYK", "B0002234R2", "B0024FAD9C", "B000FFJYE8", "B001B7CNZ6", "B000LC3ID8", "B002AMVED8", "B0018CWEVW", "B0001O3YLM", "B00003CWN3", "B0038M61IC", "B008PJZDXW", "B001AQR39O", "B00175G7CW", "B0000E5NPY", "B00004U104", "B000FIMG4U", "B003R4ZMS6", "B00DVD5SBE", "B00003CYJ4", "1573441996", "B005FLSZHY", "B000B5XOW0", "B004BZ5AHI", "B000FVQLIO", "B000F3UA6Q", "B0001DMVBC", "B001GCUBS2", "B001QE99AQ", "B003FSTN8O", "B0032JTV6A", "B0002XVKMM", "B0009298MU", "B00105303S", "0316009857", "B003F3NDP8", "B0013FSL16", "B000ERVJM2", "B001EHDSPW", "B00GOYHTB4", "B000CCBCGM", "B000V86OKG", "B005HMHPE0", "B0004Z32NI", "B00275EHFU", "B000FIMG5Y", "B002BAW6I6", "B0024FAD8S", "B000Q6GUW0", "B0009W5J4Q", "B000QUTTPG", "B00264H48E", "B004EI2NM2", "B003Z8ZC2A", "B001VPJZ0E", "B0018CWEZI", "B0014D5RBE", "B00007L4KI"], "bought_together": ["B0002MPQRS", "B000GTJSO4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005JZBPHS", "B0002MPQRS", "B000GTJSO4", "B001G0MFOM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 43160}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 18.7, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B0009QTRVI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518AP93J18L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The L Word: Season 2"}

{"description": "Anyone who enjoys cinematic fare that's off the beaten path will happily follow a zydeco-loving salt miner on a rejuvenating musical odyssey from Germany to Louisiana. Film festival award-winner Horst Krause stars as the taciturn, barrel-shaped Schultze, who is settling uneasily into retirement. He spends his drabby days in his small town polishing his garden gnomes, drinking with friends, visiting his mother in a nursing home, and playing traditional polkas on his accordion. At the 30-minute mark, Schultze, and the film, come to life when he hears zydeco on the radio and becomes enthralled in the music and the culture, going so far as to introduce his friends to such delicacies as jambalaya. .He performs zydeco at a music festival, scandalizing some of the locals. But his music club selects him to represent them in Texas at a sister city celebration, and Schultze's life takes unexpected detours. Fans of Jim Jarmusch and Aki Kaurismaki may find director Michael Schorr a kindred minimalist spirit with his long takes and deadpan sensibility. ButSchultze Gets the Bluesdances to its own quirky rhythms. While Schultze's journey comes to a downbeat conclusion, the film manages to end on a lovely grace note.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00023GP22", "B00A429YF6", "B002SF9YNO", "B000ADS6DA", "B000003OB9", "B0045ZAQSM", "B003TY2SNG", "B00860YICC", "B0037A4ILC", "0810997991", "B00AIBZLHS", "6305999872", "B002AG2NTI", "0140275010"], "bought_together": ["B00023GP22"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00023GP22", "B00A429YF6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 63182}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 29.99, "brand": "", "asin": "B0009W5IQ0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412Y111WFHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Schultze Gets the Blues"}

{"description": "Movie studios, by and large, avoid controversial subjects like race the way you might avoid a hive of angry bees. So it's remarkable thatCrasheven got made; that it's a rich, intelligent, and moving exploration of the interlocking lives of a dozen Los Angeles residents--black, white, latino, Asian, and Persian--is downright amazing. A politically nervous district attorney (Brendan Fraser) and his high-strung wife (Sandra Bullock, biting into a welcome change of pace fromMiss Congeniality) get car-jacked by an oddly sociological pair of young black men (Larenz Tate and Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges); a rich black T.V. director (Terrence Howard) and his wife (Thandie Newton) get pulled over by a white racist cop (Matt Dillon) and his reluctant partner (Ryan Phillipe); a detective (Don Cheadle) and his Latina partner and lover (Jennifer Esposito) investigate a white cop who shot a black cop--these are only three of the interlocking stories that reach up and down class lines. Writer/director Paul Haggis (who wrote the screenplay forMillion Dollar Baby) spins every character in unpredictable directions, refusing to let anyone sink into a stereotype. The cast--ranging from the famous names above to lesser-known but just as capable actors like Michael Pena (Buffalo Soldiers) and Loretta Devine (Woman Thou Art Loosed)--meets the strong script head-on, delivering galvanizing performances in short vignettes, brief glimpses that build with gut-wrenching force.

{"description": "The smartest high school drama sinceBuffy the Vampire Slayer,Veronica MarsisThe O.C.as penned by Raymond Chandler. Veronica (Kristen Bell,Deadwood) is Nancy Drew by way of Lauren Bacall, while Neptune makes Peyton Place look like Mayberry. The first season begins in the aftermath of a dizzying array of cataclysmic events: Her best friend, Lilly (Amanda Seyfried), was murdered, her sheriff father was fired over his handling of the case, she was sexually assaulted, and her mother left. Since then, Keith Mars (Enrico Colantoni,Just Shoot Me) has become a private eye and drafted Veronica as his assistant. She may lack Buffy's physical prowess, but the \"tiny blonde one\" turns out to have a special talent for sleuthing. In the wake of her sophomore year, the popular crowd abandoned Veronica--even boyfriend Duncan (Teddy Dunn), Lilly's brother. (Hence the theme song: \"We Used to Be Friends.\") Veronica is on her own until she meets Wallace (Percy Daggs III), the only student unfamiliar with her past, unlike Duncan's sarcastic pal, Logan (Jason Dohring), one of her more ardent foes. He was Lilly's boyfriend and his father is movie star Aaron Echolls (Harry Hamlin). By the end of her junior year, Veronica and Logan will make their peace, but it won't be so easy to win over the school--let alone the town. Throughout the season, Veronica will solve several mysteries both big and small--including the murder of Lilly Kane. But a few questions remain. For instance, at the end of the season finale, Veronica opens the door to greet an unseen visitor with \"I was hoping it would be you.\" So who was it? Fortunately, UPN renewed the critically acclaimed (if ratings challenged) teen noir and that tantalizing question will be answered in the second season premiere.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "The teaming of Johnny Knoxville (Jackass: The Movie) and Seann William Scott (Dude, Where's My Car?) as well as the presence of the '70s-flavored car chases that were a specialty of the TV series guarantees thatThe Dukes of Hazzardwill be even more lowbrow than the CBS TV series (1979-85) that inspired it. However, this brain-damaging comedy is more \"rehash\" than \"remake,\" as good ol' Georgia boys Luke Duke (Knoxville) and his cousin Bo (Scott) are frequently upstaged by the General Lee, the Confederate-flagged '69 Charger that they drive, jump, race, and fly in as they smuggle moonshine for their Uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson). Meanwhile, cousin Daisy Duke (Jessica Simpson) is reliably available to model her short-shorts (aka \"Daisy Dukes\") and awesome figure (and let's face it, Simpson's talents pretty much begin and end right there), while corrupt honcho Boss Hogg (Burt Reynolds, who should know better) recruits a local NASCAR star to advance his wily scheme of converting Hazzard County into a strip mine. Director Jay Chandrasekhar (Super Troopers) manages to mine some good-natured humor from the movie's oval-track detour and a few colorful supporting players (notably Kevin Hefferman as the Duke's pal Sheev).

{"description": "Blockbuster action director Michael Bay delivers a striking look at a strange world of the future in this sci-fi action drama. Midway through the 21st century, Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) lives in a confined indoor community after ongoing abuse of the Earth has rendered most of the planet uninhabitable. One of the only places in the outside world still capable of sustaining life is an idyllic island where citizens are chosen to live through a lottery. Or at least that's what Lincoln and his fellow citizens are taught to believe; the truth is that Lincoln, like everyone he knows, is actually a clone who is kept under wraps to provide needed organs when the person who supplied his or her DNA falls ill. When he becomes aware that his existence is a fraud, Lincoln escapes to the outside world with a fellow clone, Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson), though the powers that be are determined to see that no one gets away alive.The Islandalso stars Steve Buscemi, Djimon Hounsou, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Sean Bean.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767805712", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B0069UP2PI", "B00005JL78", "B0013PSTMC", "B004LWZW7E", "B004XQO90O", "B008JFUO36", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B00AEFXCLU", "B001GCUO02", "B0001NBNDY", "B002GIBVVG", "B00KHWSB5M", "B0018O4YT0", "B00005JLWN", "B0001CNRAM", "B002ZG98SW", "B00005JN0T", "B00K7IPFSM", "B00JPFTX5O", "B0009YA3OA", "B001CC7PLM", "B000AP04FG", "B005LAIIMG", "B005LAII8A", "B0013LL2Z2", "B002ZG980U", "B008JFUN50", "B00005JMWP", "B000EQHXNW", "B004WCTLNY", "B004EPYZOO", "B001GKJ2E8", "B007R6DJP8", "B00AEFXSLE", "B00AKGG8I2", "B000EZ908Y", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00BEIYIF0", "B0045HCJ8A", "B004LWZW4M", "B000BVM1S2", "B0067EKYAY", "B00AEBB8NI", "B001FB55HQ", "B00005JPAR", "B004LWZW42", "B001VLBDD0", "B0062P3392", "B000FS9FCG", "B008JFUPFI", "B00IKM5MIA", "B004A8ZX28", "B000056PMU", "B00005JPD0", "B005COLETU", "B003Q6D2B4", "B004EPYZSK", "B000P0J0EW", "B009AMAJPA", "B002SG7Z7A", "B00H83EUQW", "B000LC55F2", "B00DWZHTOU", "B005NKIPUY", "B005LAIHPE", "B000A2IPQY", "B00AEBB89W", "B0051MKNV8", "B005LAIIPS", "B001EAWMGA", "B00A7MSQRK", "6304711891", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B002GHHHOC", "B0021L8V0M", "B000P0I4O4", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AS1Q93S", "B00004XPPG", "B0045HCJFS", "B003UYUQZW", "B001OQCVI8", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00096S49Y", "B005LAIGRS", "B000EGDB10", "B002ZG984Q", "B000FGGE68", "B003L20IG0", "B0036TGSR6", "B0045HCJGC", "B002DU39GW", "B0002KVUKM", "B008JFUQZ2", "B000H30B2C", "0767803434", "B00AEBB8QK"], "bought_together": ["0767805712", "B0069UP2PI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004WCTLNY", "B004XQO90O", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B004SBQAN8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 95555}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.44, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B000BO0LH2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5133H8SZ04L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Island"}

As with the latter film,MirrorMaskfocuses on a young woman unhappy with her daily existence; here, the artistically inclined Helena (Stephanie Leonides), is at odds with her circus performer parents. When a careless insult appears to send her mother (Gina McKee) into a coma, Helena withdraws into the dark and elaborate world of her drawings, in which a scenario very similar to her predicament in the real world is unfolding. Gaiman and director McKean create arresting images to populate Helena's world, and the Henson Company brings them vividly to life with CGI; though the story is occasionally murky, the fantasy elements are imaginative enough to enthrall what will undoubtedly be the film's toughest customers--younger viewers.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005G1729K", "B002LFPBLU", "B001HN69AY", "B00000JPH6", "B00000K3D4", "B002VRNIZO", "B000934FC2", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B000EU1Q5E", "B003UAKE9Y", "B004QSQMKE", "B002UOMH00", "B000BPL2GK", "B004ALIG0G", "0060821094", "B003RHZ6IE", "B002436WFI", "B0018O4YT0", "B0011E5M66", "B0011NVC98", "B00005JPAR", "B000A283AW", "0060596384", "B002TZS5G0", "B000KJU128", "B00AEFXCLU", "0783225903", "B0031DDG9A", "B0012E2GFK", "B000C3L27U", "B008R52L8E", "B002NZK5SW", "B002FUI4CE", "B0068FZ0O2", "B00DAABKQK", "B000NJMJGG", "1616552107", "B004EPYZU8", "B00005AB62", "B002GOAH10", "B0041T52S6", "B00447L4JG", "B000YAA2SQ", "1401237541", "B00HUCF7AO", "0783225490", "0060798750", "B00003CXBK", "1593077521", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B008QE9XD2", "B003DBLDIQ", "B008JFUPPI", "B0030BS1CU", "B00077BPA0", "B0002V7O3I", "B0001Z37HM", "B002J1RZHE", "B000Q66FB6", "B002NZK5V4", "B004B93RDS", "B00006JDVV", "B0016BWACI", "B000AQOHMG", "B000E1YW2M", "B001HN694K", "B001AGXEAG", "B0010X741Y", "B006VJ1AAI", "B00C888MJ8", "B00005JLEU", "B002LFPBOM", "B0048LPRCS", "006228214X", "0061450162"], "bought_together": ["B005G1729K", "B002LFPBLU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00000JPH6", "B00000K3D4", "B00004Y7ET", "B002NZK5SW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30032}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.99, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000BT97AO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512BS13XW3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "MirrorMask"}

{"description": "The Gospelis by no means a great movie, but it has enough heart, simple decency, and fine music to make it appropriate viewing for families of all kinds. Director-screenwriter Rob Hardy's story revolves around David Taylor (played in his adult years by Boris Kodjoe), a devout youngster who, disillusioned by the death of his mother and mistrust of his pastor father (Clifton Powell), leaves the fold and goes on to become a hip-hop star. But when Bishop Taylor falls ill and David returns home to find his church in dire financial straits and about to be taken over by the Reverend Charles Frank (Idris Elba), once David's best friend but now a self-promoting, money-obsessed hypocrite, well, let's just say that one needn't be an oracle to predict how things will turn out. So the dialogue is hackneyed and the story short on nuance (the title of David's big hit, \"Let Me Undress You,\" is typical of the general lack of subtlety). What this modest film has going for it is a refreshing dearth of cynicism and pretension, not to mention a total absence of profanity, violence, and graphic sex. And in shedding light on an African-American church's place in its community, a role that is not just spiritual by financial, social, and more,The Gospelalso gives us some wonderfully infectious contemporary gospel music, performed by singers like Yolanda Adams andAmerican Idolfinalist Tamyra Gray. In fact, the music might even inspire some viewers to check out the music of some of the genre's real-life giants, like the great Rev. James Cleveland.

{"description": "On the surface, David Cronenberg may seem an unlikely candidate to directA History of Violence, but dig deeper and you'll see that he's the right man for the job. As an intellectual seeker of meaning and an avowed believer in Darwinian survival of the fittest, Cronenberg knows that the story of mild-mannered small-town diner proprietor Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) is in fact a multilayered examination of inbred human behavior, beginning when Tom's skillful killing of two would-be robbers draws unwanted attention to his idyllic family life in rural Indiana. He's got a loving wife (Maria Bello) and young daughter (Heidi Hayes) who are about to learn things about Tom they hadn't suspected, and a teenage son (Ashton Holmes) who has inherited his father's most prominent survival trait, manifesting itself in ways he never expected. By the time Tom has come into contact with a scarred villain (Ed Harris) and connections that lead him to a half-crazy kingpin (William Hurt, in a spectacular cameo), Cronenberg has plumbed the dark depths of human nature so skillfully thatA History of Violencestands well above the graphic novel that inspired it (indeed, Cronenberg was unaware of the source material behind Josh Olson's chilling adaptation). With hard-hitting violence that's as sudden as it is graphically authentic, this isA History of Violencethat's worthy of serious study and widespread acclaim.--Jeff ShannonOn the DVDOn a single disc and with little fanfare, this DVD makes an excellent case for the best extras of the year. Dive into the one-hour-long documentary and learn more about moviemaking than on many a double-disc. The secret lies in director David Cronenberg's (and his usual crew) folksy casualness in showing off the craft, be it makeup (green screens were used), directing (Cronenberg doesn't storyboard), or art direction (the diner set). It also is very funny to hear about \"fish Fridays\" and how Maria Bello's Uncle Pete became an influence. Even the infamous sex-on-the-staircase scene is diagnosed with candor as stars Viggo Mortensen and Bello act as if there is no backstage camera. There's only one deleted scene, but it's uncommonly deconstructed on why it was filmed and why it was cut (it's a very Cronenbergian dream sequence). A short bit on Cannes is also a delight. So much is here that Cronenberg's smart commentary track is nearly superfluous. Isn't that a nice surprise?--Doug ThomasMore to ExploreThe Graphic NovelOther Graphic Novels that Inspired MoviesDavid Cronenberg EssentialsWhy We Love Maria BelloThe work of Viggo MortensenThe work of William HurtStills fromA History of ViolenceViggo Mortensoe as Tom StallAshton Holmes as Jack Stall and Kyle Schmid as Bobby JordanWilliam Hurt as Richie CusackEd Harris as Carl Fogarty and Viggo Mortensen as Tom StallMaria Bello as Edie StallDirector David Cronenberg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000YENUI6", "B001LRJH0U", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B008R65XP6", "B004SIP8ZM", "B001FB5634", "B0001EFV7C", "B00004W18Z", "B001EIOOWC", "6301971345", "B000M341QE", "B00000K31T", "B000GFLKF8", "B000P0J0D8", "0767802519", "B004SUDQ72", "B003ASLJQS", "B002PJYPYG", "6304698747", "B000F5WR4W", "B003Y5H4R0", "B0018O4YT0", "B00AEBB9CS", "B0028OH568", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00000JDIQ", "B000FUTVLY", "B002AT8KAG", "B000XR9L50", "6305313687", "0783228457", "B002QEHPQU", "B001FB55L2", "B000Y7WGOW", "B002VWNIEA", "B00022XE6S", "B006PTL1QM", "B000P0J0AG", "B004499LX0", "B00005JMOW", "B002T9H2LA", "B001TOD92C", "B005OK721G", "B000FKO5QK", "B0019EXZY4", "B002ZG99N6", "B0007DFJ0G", "B003LR5BD0", "B003RHZ6F2", "B00AEFY5B6", "B000N6TX1I", "0792833279", "B005LAIIJY", "B000FVQM2Y", "B000FC2FX8", "B001BNFRB2", "B00005JN0W", "B002XMGGK6", "B00007E8UI", "B0064NTZQ2", "B00D3DJIG8", "B0010DR4BO", "B0013XZ6X4", "B00AEFXE9U", "B007D5E7C2", "B000ALM40I", "B00001ZWUS", "B00005V9HH", "B00008RH3L", "0783229402", "B000QXDCLK", "B000P0J0EW", "B000BBOUUE", "B000A7DVR2", "B000K7VHQ4", "B00000F4MA", "B000XA5K48", "B00004XPPB", "B0002IQMAM", "B00029LNYQ", "B00003CXWV", "B004XQO90O", "B000GIW9I2", "B004U7MR14", "B002DKGWSE", "B0064MT1FI", "B0000TANUI", "B009T3AE1Y", "B0000VLKVM", "B00006LPGP", "B00005JLRE", "B000F7CMRM", "B00AEFXESQ", "B001DZOC64", "1558908315", "B0036TGTDE", "B000NOKFHQ", "B008220DGE", "B00007AJE1", "B000BVM1S2"], "bought_together": ["B000YENUI6", "B001LRJH0U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000YENUI6", "B008MILL78", "B009T3AE1Y", "B000M341QE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 45602}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.36, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B000CQLZ0Q", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51g0dghsrYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A History of Violence (New Line Platinum Series) [DVD]"}

{"description": "Based on Anthony Swofford&#x92;s excellentmemoirabout his experiences as a Marine Sniper in Gulf War I,Jarheadis a war movie in which the waiting is a far greater factor upon the characters than the war itself, and the build up to combat is more drama than what combat is depicted. To some viewers hoping for typical movie action, this will seem like a cruel joke. But it&#x92;s not. It&#x92;s just the story as it was written, and if you liked the book, you will probably like the movie. If you didn&#x92;t, then the movie won&#x92;t change your mind.The movie follows the trajectory of Swofford (played with thoughtful intensity by Jake Gyllenhaal) from wayward Marine recruit (he joined because he \"got lost on the way to college\") to skilled Marine sniper, and on into the desert in preparation for the attack on Iraq. No-nonsense, Marine-for-life Staff Sgt. Sykes (Jamie Foxx), the man who recruited Swofford and his spotter Troy (Peter Sarsgaard) into the sniper team, leads them in training, and in waiting where their lives are dominated by endless tension, pointless exercises in absurdity (like playing football in the scorching heat of the desert in their gas masks so it will look better for the media&#x92;s TV cameras), more training, and constant anticipation of the moment to come when they&#x92;ll finally get to kill. When the war does come, it moves too fast for Swofford&#x92;s sniper team, and the one chance they get at a kill--to do the one thing they&#x92;ve trained so hard and waited so long for--eludes them, leaving them to wonder what was the point of all they had endured.As directed by Sam Mendes (American Beauty), the movie remains very loyal to the language and vision of the book, but it doesn&#x92;t entirely work as the film needs something more than a literal translation to bring out its full potential. Mendes&#x92;s stark and, at times, apocalyptic visuals add a lot and strike the right tone: wide shots of inky-black oil raining down on the vast, empty desert from flaming oil wells contrasted with close-ups of crude-soaked faces struggling through the mire vividly bring to life the meaning of the tagline \"welcome to the suck.\" But much of the second half of the movie will probably leave some viewers feeling disappointed in the cinematic experience, while others might appreciate its microcosmic depiction of modern chaos and aimlessness.Jarheadis one of those examples where the book is better than the movie, but not for lack of trying.--Dan Vancini", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00JRB01RK", "B00275EGWY", "B001FB55L2", "B000065U1N", "B00JRB00RG", "B000P0J09C", "B00JU949TK", "079284646X", "B002ZG97RE", "B0015D20FE", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B00001ZWUS", "B005LAIGYQ", "B00AEBBA36", "B00JA3RVG4", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B008220CQU", "B00HEPE6MM", "B00102F5WK", "B003ASLJOU", "B000095WW8", "B00AZNEW5G", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00005YUPD", "B004XQO90O", "B000Y7WGOW", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00IKM5OCO", "B00JBGSHSQ", "B00005JOFQ", "B0036RPM8Y", "B00AEBB89W", "0743244915", "B003ELKNH2", "B00JL6L4UY", "B004L3AR0K", "B00A34LX2M", "B00005PJ8T", "B004SUDQ22", "B00I4X8KXY", "B00J11U54K", "B00005JK8K", "B00J0IN6Z4", "B0034G4P30", "B00IARA8KM", "B0000AC8LR", "B000M4RG42", "B00HW3LAF2", "B00DL48BM6", "B004LGGXG4", "B0000ACOXL", "B00AEFXVCU", "B0000542CK", "B00005JLOB", "B00006JU8B", "B0000797IO", "B00JPFTS2M", "B00005U8QN", "B005LAIGRS", "B00AEBB86U", "B00HEPC0TS", "B00KDK64DY", "B00JH4SZWK", "B00IO03I6Q", "B00HWWUR02", "B001MZ5W3M", "B000KGGIZK", "B000DZ7YN8", "B00005JMXX", "B00AEBB86A", "B0007KIFGE", "B00IKM5MIA", "1558908315", "B005LAIGLE", "B001N44BVQ", "B00IJS2OHM", "B00005R87B", "B00J5JSV3A", "B00HX0KIAM", "B00ICWO144", "B00GV8B17Q", "B00JQF7ZR6", "B003UESJHO", "B00005JL5F", "B00GMV8JVI", "B00IKM5NJS", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00KNALRZ4", "B00JU94ZPS", "B00E8AVNAE", "B00HVXK15S", "B00004XPPG", "B0034G4P94", "B009POCG0Y", "B008MIL46Q", "B009AMAJPA", "B001AQO3WY", "B00HGJAPYO", "B00ALCBTWU", "B008JFUNKU"], "bought_together": ["B00275EGWY", "B000065U1N"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00275EGWY", "B00JU949TK", "B000065U1N", "B000P0J09C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15490}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.75, "brand": "VISIT MORE @ HIBISCUS EXPRESS, http://www.amazon.com/shops/AXD9LOVGJXES3", "asin": "B000DZIGDU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P2RVVCH9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jarhead (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "A statement about borders--and the absurdity of bureaucracy--The Syrian Bridestrides sucessfully between tragedy and comedy. Mona (olive-eyed Clara Khoury,Rana's Wedding) is the bride. She lives in Majdal Shams, a Druze village in the Israel-occupied Golan Heights. According to the opening title, \"Druze loyalty is split between Syria and Israel.\" Tallel (Derar Sliman), her husband-to-be, resides in Damascus. She has never met him--though shehasseen him on TV (he's a soap star). Once Mona crosses into Syria, she won't be allowed to return. Hence her wedding day begins on a somber note. Mona&#x92;s family has problems of its own. Political dissident father Hammed (Makram J. Khoury, Clara's real-lifepaterfamilias) has recently been released from jail, and it looks as if he may be sent back again (for defying parole). Older sister Amal (Paradise Now&#x92;s Hiam Abbass, who steals the show with her slow-burning intensity) is experiencing her own marital strife, while her daughter is seeing a pro-Israeli Druze.

{"description": "A masterpiece of postwar Japanese cinema, Yasujiro Ozu'sLate Springserves as an elegant primer for many of the themes that would define Ozu's later career. As with other Ozu classics, this is a calm, meditative drama about the dynamics of family, in this case the inevitable separation of 56-year-old father and widower Shukichi (Chishu Ryu) and his adult daughter Noriko (Setsuko Hara), who is content to care for her father and remain unmarried, despite the urging of friends and relatives to find a suitable husband. There are some viable candidates, and several attempts at matchmaking, but the likeliest match is a man who's already engaged. Noriko simply wishes for things to remain as they are, but when she does eventually marry a handsome chemist who \"looks like Gary Cooper,\" Ozu's drama remains intimately focused on the subtle emotions at play; there's not a scene or sequence that feels out of place, andLate Springserves a secondary function as a light and lively portrait of post-war Japan, as hints of Western influence (like a Coca-Cola sign in one of the film's most memorable scenes) that signal Japan's transition toward a modern commercial economy. Most of all, however,Late Springis a carefully observed and quietly heartbreaking story of a parent who yearns to set things right for his daughter who must balance her father's love with her own prospects for a fulfilling future. And while Ozu would go on to examine familial issues in later, equally noteworthy films,Late Springrepresents a milestone that would ensure Ozu his rightful place among the greatest of all Japanese directors.--Jeff ShannonOn the DVDsCriterion's release ofLate Springcontains a few minor flaws in terms of image quality (such as occasional emulsion scratches), but viewers can rest assured that this DVD was mastered from the finest available materials, and the film looks very good considering the conditions of post-war Japan that were typically harsh on films of that period. The \"windowbox\" framing format accurately preserves the film's original 1.33:1 aspect ratio. There's a new and improved English subtitle translation, and the audio commentary by Richard Pe&#xF1;a (an Ozu expert and program director of New York's Film Society of Lincoln Center) emphasizes the literary traditions that inform Ozu's films, in addition to the director's signature fixed-camera, low-angle style. Disc 2 includesTokyo-ga, the 1985 feature by German director (and avid Ozu admirer) Wim Wenders. It's a tribute to Ozu's Japan, in which Wenders wanders the city searching for remnants of Tokyo as seen in Ozu's films, including interviews withLate Springactor Chishu Ryu and Ozu's long-time cameraman Yuharu Atsuta. In keeping with Criterion tradition, a 21-page booklet is also included, containing informative essays by critic Michael Atkinson and renowned Japanese-film historian Donald Richie.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JLV7", "B00026L7MC", "B000OPPAF6", "B001BEK8CE", "B0001GH5RY", "B003ICZW7S", "B000NOK0H6", "B0012Z3630", "B00EO2I6W4", "B000BB14I0", "B00CEIOHPU", "B00005JLMU", "0780023307", "6305744114", "B001BEK8E2", "B00092ZLEY", "B000KRNGNQ", "B004S801ZO", "6305257450", "B005D0RDPM", "B005152C7S", "B00005QAPH", "0520032772", "0780022343", "B00005B1ZL", "B0019X400S", "B00005AUK9", "B00B2BYXSQ", "B00005JLEJ", "B00A8QDI3M", "6305131104", "B0000YEEHG", "B002U6DVQ2", "B000AQKUD6", "B005HK13S6", "B000PKG6O4", "B0009WIE2A", "B001TIQT7A", "B00005M2C7", "B00180R072", "B00000IOKV", "B000G8NXYG", "B00003CXUM", "B008CJ0JS4", "B000BR6QCI", "B005KQVE1S", "B0002J4X20", "7885729117", "B0001UZZSG", "B00K5EJHGO", "B00005BHW6", "B00AQ6J6H6", "B005MXQD74", "B0035ECI0S", "B000XPSC0C", "B009RWRINE", "B000A5044C", "B000083C5F", "B00012L786", "B000I8OOG0", "B001298BPY", "B001CW7ZTE", "B0001UZZSQ", "B0007989Y8", "B00005A8TX", "B000305ZYS", "B003D63G5E", "B000093NR0", "B00005UQ7T", "B00004W3HF", "B00005NC66", "B000BB14IA", "B0012SY0E6", "B00B2BYXYA", "B004WPYO7E", "B00019JR5Y", "B001WLMOL4", "B000E5LEV0", "B00HRJVHEK", "B0002DB4YQ", "B003TY2SNG", "B00DHN8GGW", "B0000633SD", "B00180R06I", "B000N2HBIO", "B0002DCHQA", "B00CUKTH34", "B00CUKTGQM", "B002XUL6SA", "B004M66YUS", "B00393SG0G", "B002U6DVPS", "B00006CXGZ", "B004WPYO7Y", "B000ZM1MIM", "B006X96P6U", "B007N5YJPC", "B00005QAPJ", "B003ICZW7I"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLV7", "B00026L7MC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00EO2I6W4", "B000NOK0H6", "B000OPPAF6", "B00008RH1H"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 155494}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 26.99, "brand": "Image Entertainment", "asin": "B000EOTWIS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51vG5GCICzL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Late Spring (The Criterion Collection)"}
{"description": "F-Troopbelongs to the ranks of television's great military slacker comedies, includingSgt. BilkoandMcHale's Navy. Ken Berry was promoted from bit player to leading man with his role as clueless and clumsy (\"I fall down a lot\") Wilton Parmenter, who is put in charge of the frontier post Fort Courage after a display of inadvertent Civil War heroism. \"He's the pigeon we always dreamed of,\" enthuses Sgt. O'Rourke (Forrest Tucker), who runs \"O'Rourke Enterprises\" with his sidekick Corporal Agarn (Larry Storch). Most episodes involve O'Rourke and Agarn's get-rich schemes that ultimately backfire. The show's great (albeit politically incorrect) comic conceit is the Hekawis, the decidedly un-bloodthirsty Indian tribe who makes tourist souvenirs, not war. \"We invent peace pipe,\" proclaims Chief Wild Eagle (Frank DeKova), whose broken English and anachronistic vernacular (similar to Joey Bishop inTexas Across the River) provide most of each episode's biggest--and, in these more enlightened times, guiltiest--laughs.F's troupe also includes Melody Patterson as Wrangler Jane, who has a hankerin' for \"Will\" (\"I told you, Jane, not in front of the men\"), James Hampton as bungling bugler Dobbs, Joe Brooks as nearsighted look-out Vanderbilt, cowboy star Bob Steele as gung-ho Alamo survivor Duffy, and venerable character actor (andRocky and Bullwinkle's \"Fractured Fairy Tales\" narrator) Edward Everett Horton as Hekawi medicine man Roaring Chicken. Among the more memorable guest appearances include Zsa Zsa Gabor as a gypsy who attempts to fleece Agarn in \"Play, Gypsy, Play,\" and Don Rickles (!) as Chief Wild Eagle's excitable, warlike son in \"The Return of Bald Eagle.\" The episode, \"Reunion for O'Rouke,\" contains the classic bit about how the Hekawis got their name.F-Troopdebuted in 1965 and lasted but two seasons.

Sam Smith stars as David Wiseman, a Jewish boy living in London in 1960 who dreams of being a world-class athlete. David is totally obsessed with cricket, and loves playing, even though he is one of the worst players at his school. His parents, Ruth (Emily Woof of The Full Monty) and Victor (Stanley Townsend), are struggling with the bigoted residents of their working-class neighborhood, but the neighbors get a bit more friendly to the Wisemans when Dennis (Delroy Lindo), a Jamaican laborer, and his family move in next door. David is shocked and delighted when he realizes that Dennis and his daughter, Judy (Leonie Elliott), are installing a cricket pitch in their backyard. Before long, and against the wishes of his worried parents, David is spending a lot of time next door, becoming very friendly with Judy, and becoming a much better cricket player. Ruth gradually warms to Dennis, but the rest of the neighborhood grows increasingly hostile. Wondrous Oblivion was presented by the Jewish Museum and the Film Society of Lincoln Center as part of the 2005 New York Jewish Film Festival. ...Wondrous Oblivion", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000JR0BYE", "B003CP1T50"]}, "price": 13.47, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 966796}, "asin": "B000ER5C2A", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YVRNQC80L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wondrous Oblivion [Region 2]"}

{"description": "The rapid-paced banter between the mother-daughter team of Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel) is the calling card forGilmore Girls. The show's sixth year--which aired during the 2005-2006 TV season--remains witty, charming, and touching. The previous season left Yale undergrad Rory in trouble with the law after a night of very un-Gilmore-like behavior with her rich, handsome boyfriend Logan (Matt Czuchry). This season opens with Rory potentially facing jail time, undecided about returning to college, and--most disturbingly of all--fighting with her mother. This isn't a fight over who gets to eat the last egg roll, but rather a battle of wills. It will take a few episodes before the two are talking to each other again and the viewer can breathe a sigh of relief that all is well in Stars Hollow.  In the meantime, Rory moves into her busybody grandparents' pool house. One evening, they invite their minister over to dinner. His job? To encourage Rory to remain chaste. Not one to be told how to live her life, Rory is nonplussed. After telling him he's a little too late to offer that advice, she asks, \"Have you seenThe 40 Year Old Virgin\"?After many years of playing verbal footsy, Lorelai and Luke (Scott Patterson) finally get serious and engaged. But just when things are going smoothly, Luke learns of a daughter he never knew he had. The introduction of the little girl doesn't do much for the plot--other than to slow it down and cause more fights between Luke and Lorelai. When Luke warns Lorelai, \"I don't like ultimatums,\" she snaps back, \"I don't like Mondays, but unfortunately they come around eventually.\" This 5-disc 22-episode set includes an eclectic and impressive range of guest stars (Skid Row's Sebastian Bach, Paul Anka, Sonic Youth, and Madeline Albright, who appears in a dream sequence as Rory's mom). But it's cast regular Kelly Bishop as Lorelai's mother Emily who is one of the show's true gems. Prim, proper, and judgmental, she's also fiercely protective of her brood. When she learns that Logan's mother said unfavorable things about Rory, Emily confronts the woman and puts her in her place. Politely, of course. By the end of the season, one of the main characters will get married, another will have an affair, and a third will have a dalliance with an ex-boyfriend. But the relationship between Lorelai and Rory remains strong. And that's what keeps viewers watching.--Jae-Ha Kim", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000N6TYLW", "B002BJGYV2", "B002BJGYTO", "B002BJGYTY", "B002BJGYU8", "B00B1LKXV8", "B0001CCXZW", "B006WZIAHM", "B009MA9ZW8", "B00006JIBS", "1419849565", "B00DCODLES", "B003TY2SWC", "0345532767", "B00IKB0WPE", "1593936168", "B003QZSWRY", "B00BGQ2NDO", "B00BGQ2NIO", "B0077PTWY6", "B003TNW030", "B0077PTWHI", "B00EJ1IY4K", "B000EHSVKK", "B003R4ZMJU", "B002JVWRB8", "B004HW7JI8", "B00KS9V6EC", "B00447L4KA", "B006WK4Y6I", "B00B5AAW52", "B00BGI05Y6", "B0024FAR6Q", "B00BIR381W", "B0019CSXAM", "B005IA9JSG", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B001FB4W0C", "B005G4FFBE", "B00BB8ZIRK", "B009YX8MSG", "B00E9E4F68", "B009RX7IX8", "B0058YPL66", "B0009X75QU"], "bought_together": ["B000N6TYLW", "B002BJGYV2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002BJGYV2", "B002BJGYTO", "B002BJGYTY", "B000N6TYLW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3883}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 22.45, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B000G1R4SY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51OCndnzjaL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gilmore Girls: Season 6"}
{"description": "There's never been, and never will be, another comedy likePlaytime. Three years in the making, French comedy master Jacques Tati's 1967 classic was an epic, experimental undertaking of unprecedented scale: Requiring the lavish construction of three entire city blocks of ultra-modern buildings, it was the most expensive French film up to that time, financially ruined its creator, baffled many viewers and critics when it was finally released after numerous delays, and is now regarded as Tati's undisputed masterpiece. Once again, Tati plays his comedic alter ego, the hapless M. Hulot (first seen in 1953'sMr. Hulot's Holiday), seen here as a befuddled pawn on a gigantic chessboard (metaphorically speaking) of modern conformity. He's simply trying to get to an appointment, but in the film's astonishing mock-Parisian landscape of antiseptic steel, glass, and plastic, Tati's resonant theme of contemporary confusion is fully expressed through meticulous use of framing and space--so effectively, in fact, that critic Jonathan Rosenbaum (in an accompanying essay) suggests that the film's dazzling \"Royal Garden\" sequence \"may be the most formidable example of mise-en-sc&egrave;ne in the history of cinema.\" With M. Hulot taking a back-seat to the film's breathtaking accumulation of visual details,Playtime(or, if you prefer,Play Time) rewards multiple viewings, revealing something new every time in its widescreen canvas of subtle gags and delirious eccentricity. Although journalist Art Buchwald provided English dialogue for the film,Playtimebears closer kinship to silent comedy, with universal humor and a musical soundtrack that's as essential as any of the visuals. Tati (1908-1982) never recovered from the film's financial failure, but happily, he lived long enough to seePlaytimereceive its much-deserved critical re-appraisal.--Jeff ShannonStills fromPlaytime(Click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005A8TU", "B00005A8TV", "B00180R05O", "B003UESJII", "B0007SMDCS", "B000OPPADS", "B0000BUZKP", "B00HE010QM", "B001CW7ZSA", "B00005JKPT", "6305744114", "B00005QAPJ", "B008CJ0JS4", "B0000633SC", "0870708899", "B0001ZIYDO", "B000I8OOG0", "B0012Z361M", "B000025RE7", "B00AQ6J6H6", "6305081034", "B004M66YUS", "B00092ZLEY", "B00FGVRZR4", "0780022629", "6305257450", "B00GPPXNIK", "B000E5LEV0", "B0002V7O0Q", "B00005AUKD", "B00005NC66", "0780021541", "B00065GX64", "B000FILVNM", "B00000IOKV", "B00K5EJHGO", "B005HK13S6", "B00003CWTI", "B000065V38", "B002U6DVQ2", "B004WPYO7E", "B0068CEH12", "B00005B1ZK", "B000093NQZ", "B000093NR0", "B001LMU1C8", "B000C8Q900", "B00005EBSB", "B00005Y727", "B00005QAPH", "B000YAA68W", "B009VO9XSG", "B002PAD2S0", "B000244F2S", "B00GRA7M2G", "B000EOTWIS", "B00AQ6J64O", "B000TXNDV6", "B001D8W7EU", "B004ALIG4M", "B005152C7S", "B000A5044C", "B00004XQMY", "B000063K2Q", "0780022343", "1559409053", "B000A0GOF0", "B003V5EH6E", "B00005PJ8T", "B000ZM1MIM", "B004WPYO6U", "B0035ECHIG", "B00AEFY9GW", "B003SEH3EQ", "0062026151", "B00005JKGO", "B00023P4N8", "B00000F7E6", "B002E01MBA", "B000BB14IA", "B000UJ48SQ", "B00005B1ZM", "B000K0YLX2", "B0009S4IJW", "B00A3IOY8S", "0374289204", "B002AFX53C", "B000NOK0HG", "B0047P5FSQ", "B002C8YSDI", "B0001IN0MQ", "B000FUF7CQ", "B001WLMOHI", "B002945DUW", "B00004Z1FM", "B00AQ6J5JU", "B00AEBB89C", "0816616779", "B00AQ6J3AG"], "bought_together": ["B00005A8TV"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005A8TV", "B00005A8TU", "B004WPYO7E", "B00LUSUVB4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 80248}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 76.99, "brand": "Image Entertainment", "asin": "B000G8NXZ0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y3A1SBFQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Playtime (The Criterion Collection)"}

{"description": "Lo and behold,Clerks IIdefies the odds as a sequel that even the most ardentClerksfans can be happy about. Twelve years after Kevin Smith turned the independent film world upside-down with his $27,000 black-and-white comedy, perpetual slackers Dante (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson) return for another raucous romp in suburbia, but this time there's no beloved Quick Stop mini-mart to ensure their low-level employment. Now they're aimless 33-year-olds flippin' burgers at Mooby's, a fast-food joint with a cow theme that's \"udderly delicious.\" Dante's engaged to his long-time girlfriend but has unexpectedly fallen in love with Mooby's manager Becky (and since she's played by Rosario Dawson, can you blame him?), and Randal's still holding out for life, liberty, and the pursuit of low ambition. The responsibilities of adulthood are rearing their ugly head, and with Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith) still dealing weed and generally being obnoxious, well... something's gotta give, right? The way Smith has written this long-awaited follow-up, the dilemmas of Dante, Randal, and their ongoing friendship are something that anyone can relate to, and with Dawson lighting up the screen (in a role demanded by producer Harvey Weinstein to boost box-office appeal), the movie's romantic chemistry is surprisingly delightful. Rest assured, also, that Smith (shooting mostly in color this time, on a $5 million budget) hasn't forgotten where he came from:Clerks IIis jam-packed with the same lewd, crude humor that madeClerksan indie-film phenomenon, and Smith's good-natured sincerity is still on full display, ensuring that only the most prudish viewers could possibly be offended. For everyone else, this is as enjoyable as any sequel could ever hope to be, with amusing cameos by Smith-movie veterans Ben Affleck and Jason Lee, among others.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SIP6LS", "B00000IQW4", "B004SIP8ES", "B004XVMCH6", "B007D0FUTG", "B00003CWOL", "B004U7MQW4", "B001KKU9DW", "B005FUTBWS", "B0016MJ6GA", "B00007149S", "B000CPH9PM", "B004SIP6N6", "B001CDFY4Q", "B000I0QLOQ", "B000ICL3L0", "B000EMGJAO", "1592406890", "B001OD4S50", "B000JJ4DNW", "B00068WOH8", "B0018BZEOC", "B005G5NPLA", "B0023TCWE8", "B00363WGBO", "B0002V7TMY", "B007D0FVYA", "B00003CXPS", "B000A7DVR2", "B001J9KJ4I", "0783230338", "B000BBOUCC", "B00009MGEM", "B000093FLA", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000031EFY", "B001C0JCBA", "B006WXHJLC", "B00029LO5E", "B001MFNB58", "0783227434", "B002ZG96ZC", "0800141687", "B008220BGQ", "B00007AJGM", "B0050PYNP8", "B00441GYVA", "B000M9CB4W", "1592407447", "B00BEIYH1A", "B00AEFXVW0", "B000WC3864", "B00AEFZ7F4", "B003VPX5Y4", "0767837398", "B005LAII12", "B000BYA5G4", "B009AMALGM", "B000AARKXA", "B00003CXS7", "B000GBEWGQ", "B000AXWHSA", "B004QL7K70", "0783229526", "B00005JN2Z", "B002O3Z4VG", "B00B4VSUBK", "B000WZEZGI", "B000VXWX7E", "B002ZG97XI", "B00BPEJWAE", "B008RNYMG0", "184856497X", "B00860YIJU", "B004SIP8ZM", "B004EPZ084", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00008975Z", "B00005JM23", "B000IZJZIU", "B003Y5H5C4", "B006TTC50Y", "B004SEUJFK", "B00E1HIX66", "B00005JKMN", "B00005JKHP", "B000069CF0", "B00007ELER", "B009DA743Y", "B001G5T6GW", "B00004TJMW", "B0006HBZE2", "B00005JNZU", "B00029RTAI", "B004UXUWEC", "B0018RKEQE", "6305551235", "B007WW94TW"], "bought_together": ["B004SIP6LS", "B00000IQW4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004SIP6LS", "B00000IQW4", "B0016MJ6GA", "B004SIP8ES"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14519}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.25, "brand": "Weinstein Company", "asin": "B000I0RNVQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51tIUlFx1EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Clerks II (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}

Esteban (Gastn Pauls) is a writer edging into middle age who has received word that Vargas (Pablo Ribba), who served with him in the Argentine Army during the 1980s, has attempted to commit suicide and is now in a coma. The news floods Esteban's mind with memories of their days in the Falkland Islands war of 1982. Esteban, Vargas, and Juan (Cesar Albarracin) were all new recruits who knew next to nothing about battle when they were sent to the rocky islands to fend off a possible invasion by the British military. Juan and Vargas both have more on their minds than imminent battle -- Juan worries about his young son at home, while Vargas left for the islands on bad terms with both his parents and his girlfriend. As the soldiers struggle to pass the time while waiting for the seemingly inevitable war to start, Esteban, Juan, and Vargas capture and roast a sheep; Vargas is severely punished for his part in the sheep-napping, and is on emotionally shaking ground when the British Navy begins raining death upon the ill-equipped Argentineans.

{"description": "Here's one of Hollywood's great excursions into surrealism:The Gang's All Here, the legendarily over-the-top wartime musical. Director Busby Berkeley threw every demented idea that every swirled out of his teeming brain into this madcap affair, and decades later the film was still wowing 'em as a campy jaw-dropper.The plot is the nonsensical stuff of homefront musicals, with chorus girl Alice Faye waiting for soldier boy James Ellison to return from the war, little knowing he is engaged to another woman. But the real point here is the crazy production design and the flabbergasting numbers--most famously, Carmen Miranda's \"The Lady in the Tutti-Frutti Hat,\" which includes a chorus line of women dancing while holding giant bananas over their heads. It might have been dreamed up by Salvador Dali after an acid trip. Alice gets her due with the equally crazy \"Polka-Dot Polka,\" and Benny Goodman and his orchestra are also around. So are such reliable second bananas (you should excuse the expression) as Edward Everett Horton and high-kicking Charlotte Greenwood.The DVD extras include a 20-minute documentary on Berkeley's peculiar art, plus a charming 25-promotional film featuring Alice Faye reminiscing about her old pictures and extolling the virtues of physical fitness (made for the Pfizer drug company while Faye was their spokesperson). A deleted comedy scene and two episodes from the long-running radio show Faye did with husband Phil Harris are also included. The print itself is a source of controversy; the colors lack the \"pop\" of the original Technicolor, and the film looks dimmer and vaguer than its original glory. Here's hoping a cleaner, fuller version will emerge.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000K7VHNM", "B000BZISUI", "B000EXDSA2", "B00K8CQ1Q2", "B0019APR62", "B000EXDSAC", "B0002B15RE", "B0019APR6W", "B00KIZY3XW", "B000EXDS7A", "B0019APR5S", "B00008DDRU", "B00KGLS050", "B00158K1B4", "B0009NZ2NS", "B0019APR6M", "B000AP04LK", "B000K7VHNC", "B00158K1AK", "B000BZISU8", "B000PC8AL4", "B000GETTIO", "B00DZFKN54", "B0007939MK", "B0002XNT08", "B00199PPUG", "B004KZH5F4", "B000KJTBZG", "B004132I6Q", "B00158K1AU", "B00012FXJ0", "B00DVPMYWI", "B0001DCYUK", "B00007GZQF", "B00143XE1E", "B0047BXR1C", "B0011FDVD6", "B000W089XS", "B000EXDS9S", "B00GXKZQIM", "B000EBD9S0", "B00AQ6J64O", "B00I04SVV8", "B00I39V9H8", "B00B27WTBI", "B006TTC5A4", "B000PAAK5A", "B000UZDO3A", "B00143XE28", "B0008ENICU", "B000244EZ6", "B00143XDYC", "B000E0OE1M", "B0002B15Y2", "B00023P4OC", "B0062Z0PLQ", "B000BQ7JVG", "B000EBD9SK", "B0001LJCRA", "B000KGGJ1I", "B000KJTGFG", "B00C3ALM02", "B00BGGIXZQ", "B00457ZNS8", "B00GTSVPHY", "B000087F79", "B000EBD9SA", "B00GTSVM8Q", "B0001FR55C", "B001D8W7F4", "B00005LDCR", "B00A2536DG", "B00CA4S308", "B00006RCO1", "B000DZD9SM", "B00005A06N", "B00005JKS8", "B0008ENICA", "B0001FGBZW", "B001BPB5Y8", "B000H1RFSM", "B000059GEI", "B00CVB6XF2", "B002EWD0DG", "B00158K1A0", "B004KZH5KY", "B00CS711FQ", "B00GST8H70", "B00BY8DAAE", "B00466JALY", "B009X919UE", "B00178T3Q6", "B000BOH922", "B0019APR6C", "B000EU1Q1S", "B000EXDSBQ", "B0007ZEOQE", "B00IELX388", "B0024FAG8A", "B000E0ODZY"], "bought_together": ["B000K7VHNM", "B000EXDSA2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000K7VHNM", "B00158K14G", "B000EXDSA2", "B000BZISUI"]}, "price": 19.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 252085}, "asin": "B000K7VHN2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SIqxloAVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Gang's All Here"}
{"description": "First screened in Europe and scheduled for limited release in the U.S.,The Illusionistoffers welcome proof that \"arthouse\" quality needn't be limited to the arthouses. Set in turn-of-the-century Vienna, this stately, elegant period film benefited from a crossover release in mainstream cinemas, and showed considerable box-office staying power--granted, teenage mallrats and lusty males may have been drawn to the allure ofSeventh Heavenalumna Jessica Biel, who rises to the occasion with a fine performance. But there's equal appeal in the casting of Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti, who bring their formidable talents to bear on the intriguing tale of a celebrated magician named Eisenheim (Norton) whose stage performance offends the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), a vindictive lout who aims to marry Duchess Sophie (Biel), Eisenheim's childhood friend and now, 15 years later, his would-be lover. This romantic rivalry and Eisenheim's increasingly enigmatic craft of illusion are investigated by Chief Inspector Uhl (Giamatti), who's under Leopold's command and is therefore not to be trusted as Eisenheim and Sophie draw closer to their inevitable reunion. Cleverly adapted by director Neil Burger from Steven Millhauser's short story \"Eisenheim the Illusionist,\" and boasting exquisite production values and a fine score by Philip Glass,The Illusionistis the kind of class act that fully deserved its unusually wide and appreciative audience. --Jeff ShannonBeyondThe Illusionist\"Eisenheim the Illusionist\" and Other StoriesPaul Giamatti in a More Loveable RoleMagic Kits & AccessoriesStills fromThe Illusionist", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000LC55F2", "B000NOIX48", "B002ZG980U", "B002WNU0QW", "B00DWZHTOU", "B001MZ5W3M", "B00011CZRE", "B000H0MKI8", "B00008K7AO", "B000L212HC", "B00AEBB8NI", "B000GFLKF8", "B000O76ZO4", "B00003CXZ4", "B00005JLSB", "B000FKO5QK", "B000M341QE", "B00AEFXGIY", "B00005V9HH", "B00AEBB8LA", "B00005JMOW", "B00096S49Y", "0767847415", "6305313687", "B004SIP9Z6", "B0047T74CM", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000R4SMCW", "B0002YLCG0", "B000P0J0EW", "B000HEWEE4", "B0041KKYHE", "B00BBI7EZY", "B00AEBBA2W", "B000CQLZ0Q", "0783235070", "0767802519", "B002ZG997C", "B00003CXHG", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000069HZP", "B004SIP7PS", "B003ASLJQI", "B00177Y9ZC", "B00005JLKN", "B003ZW9H68", "B001N44BVQ", "B002O3Z50Q", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005JN2Z", "B00AEBB86A", "B00000F4ZY", "B000MZHW40", "0671686402", "B00BB67UNW", "B005HP2J0M", "B000QXDED6", "B000NIVJF4", "B001F12J0C", "B000N6TX1I", "B000LAZE8C", "B00080ZG10", "B005LAIGRS", "B0009MDPYM", "0792159659", "B000OYC7BW", "B001UV4XGU", "B004AOECXI", "0767818105", "B000XR9L50", "B0018O4YT0", "B00015YVDG", "B004SIP8JI", "B00004XPPG", "B00006ZXSK", "B001DHXT20", "B0000AC8LR", "B009B8YMB0", "0783229402", "B0006210ZG", "B001PPGAIA", "B00004BZIY", "B008JFURII", "B00005JPAR", "B00006ADFM", "B004SIP7TE", "B000F5GNX8", "B000FS9FCG", "B006P0FIGU", "B00005JMCN", "B002VWNID6", "B004XQO90O", "B004EPZ084", "B00AEBB9M8", "B000P5FH3K", "B00005JNY3", "B000063US3", "B003L20IG0"], "bought_together": ["B000LC55F2", "B002ZG980U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000LC55F2", "B005LAIHXQ", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00DV2MVWO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 60145}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B000K7VHPU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nYghoS63L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Illusionist (Full Screen Edition)"}

{"description": "Growing up can be a confusing journey fraught with difficult choices.  Boog (Martin Lawrence) is a domesticated Grizzly Bear who leads a perfectly happy life inside of Park Ranger Beth's (Debra Messing) garage, but a chance meeting with an overly energetic mule deer named Elliot (Ashton Kutcher) quickly changes everything and lands Boog high in the forest a few days before the opening of hunting season.  Devoid of even the most basic survival skills, Boog and Elliot stumble through the woods and find themselves at the mercy of every forest animal from skunks to chipmunks as well as an evil hunter named Shaw (Gary Sinise).  After unintentionally inciting and endangering an entire forest full of clever animals, Boog and Elliot come to the realization that only by banding together do the forest animals stand a chance of outsmarting the hunters and ensuring their own survival.This first animated film from Sony Pictures Animation takes its inspiration from cartoonist Steve Moore(In the Bleachers)and features animals with human-like intelligence, a vibrant color palate, and skilled animation that makes everything from the wind blowing Boo's fur to the animals' wild trip down the falls simply breathtaking.  While it doesn't quite live up toOver the Hedge,Open Seasonis an entertaining production that explores the difficult process of maturation, the universal need for acceptance, and the true value of friendship.

{"description": "The history of hardcore punk--the tougher, faster, and more politically minded stepchild of the '70s punk movement that arose in the '80s--is examined in exuberant detail in Paul Rachman's documentaryAmerican Hardcore. Rachman's cameras careen across the landscape of the U.S. to trace the movement's beginnings in cities like Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and New York, and cherrypicks interviews with the musicians that helped shape its sound and impact, including Henry Rollins and Greg Ginn of Black Flag, H.R. (frontman for the highly influential, all-African American outfit Bad Brains), Ian MacKaye of Minor Threat (and now Fugazi), and many others. Hardcore's violent reaction against the Reagan administration and the complacent mindset of middle-class America is also detailed in countless performance footage clips and poster-art reproductions, which do much to dismiss the popular opinion of hardcore as nothing more than mindless hooliganism. Some fans may find the omission of certain bands a considerable oversight (San Francisco's lethally satirical Dead Kennedys are not mentioned only in passing), but for most punk devotees,American Hardcorewill be vital and essential viewing. The DVD includes several deleted scenes and bonus performances, commentary by Rachman and writer Steven Blush (whose book of the same name provided the inspiration for the film), and a gallery of photos from photographer Edward Colver, who covered the hardcore scene in detail during its heyday.-- Paul GaitaStills fromAmerican Hardcore(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001BTODPM", "B0002NRS0U", "B0035CVB2G", "1932595899", "B00465I1B0", "B009ES41TK", "0767837398", "B00IGL2M9C", "B00003CXHM", "B000642JG8", "B001AR4K6C", "B00JQYUXTE", "B000HWZ5XS", "B001ECDVIG", "B000001Q3T", "B000000JO3", "B000000LZ2", "1604864184", "B005Z4D2EC", "B005CM3HLK", "B0035CVB1W", "B00B8VX82W", "B00CPTUMO8", "B000BR9S96", "0802142648", "B000063UQN", "B0081L6NH4", "B00118SUIO", "0991344707", "B000EGEJIY", "B00004TBTH", "B0017WI5W0", "0922915709", "B0007IO740", "B002IJQ2YY", "B007LNJ62C", "1550229567", "B000000HSU", "B00104AYGU", "1402779372", "B002RVZV9K", "B000000LZL", "B004H0B0G2", "B0034PJWJ8", "B000GTLB12", "B00004YLAP", "B000000I32", "B000000LZO", "B000A0GP4K", "B00D5XC8PE", "B00004YZFR", "B00005LO66", "B000GI3RKQ", "B007GFYC0Q", "B000A2H2QI", "B00006JU7P", "1560257695", "B00005JGAF", "B000CNESU8", "097961631X", "0316787531", "B0000AINHF", "B000000M3J", "B000000M2J", "B00267N3FO", "B007QD0UP4", "B002QC7Y4U", "B0006L0LM0", "B004GGU9KK", "B00009QI2F", "B0009YNSLK", "B002QZ2DPW", "B00A3A3V0I", "B000LEB7LG", "B00AEBB8XS", "B001NY71F4", "B001MFNB5I", "B000009NXI", "B0007L6PRY", "B000SQLC2G", "1901447707", "B000008M4F"], "bought_together": ["B001BTODPM", "B0002NRS0U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["1932595899", "B0002NRS0U", "B0035CVB2G", "B00AEBBADG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 61028}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 7.51, "brand": "Unknown", "asin": "B000LPR6FQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RdpcO-OEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "American Hardcore - The History of Punk Rock 1980 - 1986"}
{"description": "Much was written about Will Ferrell's first \"dramatic role\" as Harold Crick, an IRS auditor who begins hearing a voice narrating his life. ButStranger Than Fictionis hardly a drama. However, what Ferrell does--like Jim Carrey before him inThe Truman Show--is handle a toned-down character with genuineness and affection: you believe he is this guy. Crick leads a lonely life filled with numbers and routines. While at first he considers the voice a nuisance, Crick decides more action is needed when it speaks of \"his demise.\" Enter Professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), who takes on the absurd notion with revelry, trying to find out what kind of book Crick's life is leading. It turns out that the voice Crick is hearing belongs to Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson), a very real--and troubled--author who is writing a book in which Crick is a fictional character. As usual with these things, the stuffed shirt learns to live a better life--Crick even falls for one of his audits, a brash baker named Ana (Maggie Gyllenhaal). Marc Foster (Monster's Ball, Finding Neverland) has the right tone for the film, using great urban scenes (the unnamed city is Chicago) with interesting visualizations of Crick's world of numbers. He also directs Ferrell, Hoffman, and Gyllenhaal to their most charming performances (plus Linda Hunt and Tom Hulce pop up in two funny scenes). Ferrell succeeds in being a romantic lead you can root for; a scene where he eats Ana's freshly baked cookies is totally delightful without a hint of sarcasm. Screenwriter Zach Helm has two personal traits with his story: like Crick he followed his heart (he stopped rewriting scripts and only worked on his own) and like Eiffel, the final results are not a masterpiece, but good, and entertaining enough.

{"description": "Based on the WWI adventure novelBrown on Resolutionby C.S. Forester,Sailor of the Kingis an enjoyable British-made war drama buoyed by its energetic star, Jeffrey Hunter, and an exciting and suspenseful premise. The picture opens on a slow note with British Navy captain Michael Rennie ending a tryst with English girl Wendy Hiller; years later, the product of that union is British-Canadian sailor Jeffrey Hunter, whose ship is dispatched to intercept a powerful German warship by now-Admiral Rennie. The ensuing fight sinks Hunter's ship and damages the German boat, but Hunter evades capture and hunkers down on the island where the Nazi captain (Peter Van Eyck) has docked for repairs; there he wages a one-man assault against the ship using only a rifle and his own skills. Roy Boulting's direction is crisp and assured, and the cast, especially the underappreciated Hunter (in his first leading role), is uniformly fine, which should makeSailor of the Kinga worthwhile discovery for WWII action fans. The DVD includes two endings--the original British release, which adds to the Rennie-Hiller relationship, and the pat American conclusion.-- Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001FVDGE", "B000NTPG66", "B000EHSVVE", "B000EHSVVO", "B000MGBLIC", "B005HQBO9I", "B004176JJY", "B000NO1XJA", "B000H1RFQ4", "B000MGBLIW", "B00CHYSSME", "B000EMGJFE", "B004VGHF7K", "B00LG22EZA", "B00005PJ8K", "B00096S4BM", "B000EHSVUK", "B000063URX", "B000MGBLJQ", "B000MGBLJ6", "B0029778T8", "B000H1RFSM", "B004R6EFAO", "B0001NBMHQ", "B00005JN9P", "B000E5N6KW", "B004CZZZ3Q", "B004U7EIES", "B005HQBO9S", "B005MXQD4W", "B00008AOTO", "B008A1TWXC", "B00143XE0U", "B0015S2OWI", "B00096S4B2", "B00C2535TE", "B00HZOXRCC", "B000TLTCPO", "B000EHSVV4", "B004R6EF9U", "B00008AOTR", "B0000AMRUP", "B0001NBMGC", "B000066C6H", "B00005R23T", "B00008DDGW", "B0008ENHU8", "B007HCI42A", "B000MGBLIM", "B00KIZYDCI", "B005DIA0IQ", "B00KH53QY0", "B00005B1YF", "B000EHSVX2", "B00AEFXLKC", "B0009UVCQW", "B00KIZY3XW", "B00005JP3T", "B00D3XMA9A", "B004IFYMXO", "B002DNLT1Q", "B004LB5FB8", "B0001NBMI0", "B00005PJ8L", "B00441GYYC", "B005DTZXMI", "B00008R9M6", "B005OTGS4E", "B00D3XM7H0", "B003B3NV5E", "B004GSVXBW", "B000E0WJN2", "B00BY0EBK0", "B004IFYMXE", "B00KIZY8IW", "B007232B5K", "B000063URW", "B000NTPG6Q", "B00005OSJQ", "B0001WTWWE", "B000BPL2FG", "B0007ZEOQE", "B008F0QBB4", "B0005C9MQ6", "B007SVMWBE", "B00096S4DA", "B0082SIGR6", "0792841662", "B00005B1YH", "B000NO1XMC", "B0006B2A42", "B00EVIOVM0", "B00005QCVP", "B0001NBMH6", "B00CZ7ALDM", "B0007TKNDI", "B0046DBTC0", "B004X63SEM", "B00096S4BW", "B00CV1PG32"], "bought_together": ["B0001FVDGE", "B000NTPG66"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001FVDGE", "B000NTPG66", "B000EHSVVE", "B000H1RFSM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 88334}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.86, "brand": "20TH CENTURY FOX HOME ENTMNT", "asin": "B000MGBLJG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51O3UmxEgiL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sailor of the King"}
