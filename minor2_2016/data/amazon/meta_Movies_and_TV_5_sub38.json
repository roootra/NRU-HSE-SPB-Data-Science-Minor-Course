{"description": "In the first and finestRoboCopmovie, director Paul Verhoeven combined near-future science fiction with a keen sense of social satire--not to mention enough high-velocity violence to satisfy even the most voracious bloodlust. InStarship Troopers, Verhoeven andRoboCopcowriter Ed Neumeier take inspired cues from Robert Heinlein's classic sci-fi novel to create a special-effects extravaganza that functions on multiple levels of entertainment. The film might be called &quot;Melrose Place in Space,&quot; with its youthful cast of handsome guys and gorgeous women who look like they've been recruited (and in some cases they were) from the cast ofBeverly Hills 90210. Viewers might focus on the incredible, graphically intense action sequences (definitelynotfor children) in which heavily armed forces from Earth go to off-world battle against vast hordes of alien &quot;bugs&quot; bent on planetary conquest. The attacking bugs are marvels of state-of-the-art special-effects technology, and the space battles are nothing short of spectacular. ButStarship Troopersis more than a showcase for high-tech hardware and gigantic, flesh-ripping insects.  Recalling his childhood in Holland during the Nazi occupation, Verhoeven turns this epic adventure into a scathingly funny satire of fascist propaganda, emphasizing Heinlein's underlying warning against the hazards of military conformity and the sickening realities of war. It's an action-packed joy ride if that's all you're looking for, but Verhoeven has a provocative agenda that makesStarship Troopersas smart as it is exciting. The DVD includes an above-average commentary by the director and Neumeier, several deleted scenes, a behind-the-scenes documentary and promotional featurette, cast bios, production notes, and more.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0018CWWA0", "B0001XAOQ6", "B0088X7YMS", "B00D3LA7G0", "B00005N7Z1", "B00070FX5U", "0800195175", "B001ECDVKE", "B00005JA8B", "B00004Y87O", "B0000844I8", "B00008G8LY", "B004P7CN5O", "0441783589", "B00008G8M4", "0780622650", "B00003L9CQ", "B004P7CN7W", "B001JFZ118", "B003XURDAY", "B00I9TDMRM", "B001ILHY1I", "B0002CHK1S", "B00IMYVCGW", "B00000ILDD", "B009YQJ322", "B00000G3PA", "0767817478", "B0088X7YU0", "079284646X", "B000068MC3", "B000P0J09C", "B007STBUHI", "B007D5E7C2", "B004L9GMBC", "B002NZK5U0", "B00026ZG10", "B0045HCJ0S", "B00E8G5HQE", "B00009ATIX", "0783227434", "0780619951", "B000QXDED6", "B00D7AM6M0", "B00006JDVV", "B00AEFY3MC", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B0085A9J18", "B0000959N0", "B004P7CMOQ", "B00005JLQN", "B000RW3VCK", "B0004Z33G4", "B0000UJL96", "B0009JE6G6", "B000JJ4DNW", "B00005JM5B", "B000035Z38", "0767802454", "B0009MDPYM", "B005LAIH54", "B0000AOX0F", "B000VR0570", "B00AEFYDM2", "B00AEFXW8I", "0767802519", "6304711891", "B005G4TJUC", "B00AKGG828", "6305869103", "B0015RCUR8", "B000P0J0AQ", "B008CYDD7I", "0783226837", "B004SIP9Z6", "B002GHHHL0", "B0001VTPW2", "B0009X76XC", "B003J42JLC", "B00003CY6P", "B00000J11D", "B001KKU9DW", "B00AEBB9SM", "B006ZGROB6", "B00AEFXPMG", "1558908846", "B0002V7OI8", "B001VLFE7G", "B0087ZG7HK", "B0000A2ZU1", "B000A5045Q", "B008JFUQZ2", "0800141822", "B000096IAC", "B002ZG98C8", "B001B3LIOC", "B0068FZ0O2", "B000NQRR1G", "B008JFUN50"], "bought_together": ["B0018CWWA0", "B0001XAOQ6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0018CWW9G", "B0088X7YMS", "B00070FX5U", "B0090SI56Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 183809}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.55, "brand": "Sony Pictures Home Entertainment", "asin": "0767802659", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51967mHEbrL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Starship Troopers"}
{"description": "For all of its conventional plotting about an obsessive-compulsive curmudgeon (Jack Nicholson) who improves his personality at the urging of his gay neighbor (Greg Kinnear) and a waitress (Helen Hunt) who inspires his best behavior, this is one of the sharpest Hollywood comedies of the 1990s. Nicholson could play his role in his sleep (the Oscar he won should have gone to Robert Duvall forThe Apostle), but his mischievous persona is precisely necessary to give heart to his seemingly heartless character, who is of all things a successful romance novelist. As a single mom with a chronically asthmatic young son, Hunt gives the film its conscience and integrity (along with plenty of wry humor), and she also won an Oscar for her wonderful performance. Greg Kinnear had to settle for an Oscar nomination (while cowriter-director James L. Brooks was inexplicably snubbed by Oscar that year), but his work was also singled out in the film's near-unanimous chorus of critical praise. It's questionable whether a romance between Hunt and the much older Nicholson is entirely believable, but this movie's smart enough--and charmingly funny enough--to make it seem endearingly possible.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001AVZA8", "B000YAF4MA", "0800141741", "B004FQX5B6", "B0000YEEGM", "B0038N9WKU", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00AEBB9WI", "B00005JLSK", "0783226845", "B0000AOV4I", "B000YDBPAM", "B000XJD33O", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00081U7HC", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00003CXFV", "B001ECDVK4", "6305212112", "B000EHRVOW", "B00009Y3PV", "6304765266", "B00004RJ73", "B005F2JRUC", "0783225733", "B00AEFXYOA", "6305236569", "B000OCZA04", "B000FFJYBG", "B003ASLJK4", "0792833198", "B000JYW5B4", "B00012QLB4", "B00BTYRB3U", "B0043X1FL8", "B000055Y0Y", "B00005B6JZ", "B000EHQU0S", "B00AEBB9UK", "B00008G7UF", "B0002B15ZG", "B00005JG6N", "B001MBTTNA", "B001ECDVJU", "B00003CWQR", "B00AEFY4CG", "630471193X", "B002GHHHP6", "B00AEBB9NM", "B0000A02TZ", "0767821769", "B00569I5BQ", "B00AEFYSWM", "B00AEFXYJA", "B000XT1P3E", "B002GHHHGU", "B00026ZG10", "6305128952", "B00005OLYF", "B001LMAK9W", "B000N6U0E2", "B000EMGJ7C", "B000023VTP", "B00CPTUOI2", "B004SIP9U6", "B00001ZWUS", "B003BV8ICC", "B0043X1FM2", "B0013XZ2QK", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00AEBB9FA", "B007SPPANM", "B00005JM4Q", "B007N31YH0", "B000VECAD0", "B00003CXO1", "B00009WVSL", "B00003CXSM", "B000NA1WDQ", "B00004BZIY", "B002AS464Q", "B000J103OI", "B000021Y7L", "B000ENC5YW", "B0002V7ON8", "B00009W5CA", "B00015YVDG", "B0009X75O2", "B0000JBALO", "0767803434", "6305065551", "B000MQC9H4", "6305692572", "B00013RC2U", "6305144168", "B00008979G", "B000CCBCAS", "0792846443", "B000M341QE"], "bought_together": ["B0001AVZA8", "B000YAF4MA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001AVZA8", "B0038N9WKU", "B000YAF4MA", "B00013WWT8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5469}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.96, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "0767811100", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KRRMHSAJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "As Good As It Gets"}
{"description": "Based on a memoir by former undercover cop Joe Pistone (whose daring and unprecedented infiltration of the New York Mob scene earned him a place in the federal witness protection program),Donnie Brascois like a de- romanticized, de-mythologized version ofThe Godfather. It offers an uncommonly detailed, privileged glimpse inside the world of organized crime from the perspective of the little guys at the bottom of Mafia hierarchy rather than from the kingpins at the top.Donnie Brascois not only one of the great modern-day gangster movies to put in the company ofThe Godfatherfilms andGoodFellas, but it is also one of the great undercover police movies--arguably surpassingSerpicoandPrince of the Cityin richness of character, detail, and moral complexity. Donnie (Johnny Depp, a splendid actor) is practically adopted by Lefty Ruggiero (Al Pacino), a gregarious, low-level &quot;made&quot; man who grows to love his young prot&eacute;g&eacute; like a son. (Pacino really sinks into this guy's skin and polyester slacks, and creates his freshest, most fully realized character since his 1970s heyday.) As Donnie acclimates himself to Lefty's world, he distances himself from his wife (a terrific Anne Heche) and family for their own protection. Almost imperceptibly his sense of identity slips away from him. Questioning his own confused loyalties, unable to trust anybody else because he himself is an imposter, Donnie loses his way in a murky and treacherous no-man's land. The film is directed by Mike Newell, who also headed upFour Weddings and a Funeraland the gritty, true crime melodramaDance with a Stranger.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000AM6JI", "B000C20VPA", "B000P0J09M", "B000P0J0AG", "B00004U103", "B00003CXWV", "B008R65XYC", "B0000DI87S", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000C20VRS", "B002QEHPQU", "B002CPMB9O", "B007TBIUSM", "B0006GAOJA", "B000286RP2", "B00AEBB95K", "B000M341QE", "B0018CMJSU", "B00000IRE6", "B00005R87R", "B00013RC2U", "B00G1C2URC", "B004P7CNC2", "B000CNESTE", "0767830555", "B00008RH3L", "B0000WN140", "B000H5TH20", "B00008975Z", "B0001FGBUW", "B0019L21GA", "B000F7CECK", "B0000AMJEK", "B000E5KQHI", "B004SIP7TE", "B002VWNIEA", "B004G7XCRQ", "B004SIP95G", "B00CCMKPO0", "B0009UZG0K", "B001C0I61M", "B006TTC5HC", "B000A2UBN4", "B001EZE5BU", "B0000VD04M", "B00005V9HH", "B006ISJQ1W", "0451192575", "B000NQRR1Q", "B00008CMRK", "B004SIP8ZM", "B0002234LS", "0780621611", "B0019L770A", "B00006JDU8", "B000ERVKBC", "B00AEFYYWQ", "6305065551", "B00AEBB8LA", "B000ZS8GWQ", "0792838076", "B00011CZRE", "B0000YEE6M", "0780628551", "B000LP6KNU", "B000FDEV3Y", "079284646X", "B00003CXRG", "B0000714BS", "B002VWNICC", "B0019L21H4", "6305313687", "B000067IZ3", "6305263248", "B001HN69AY", "B004SIP93S", "B004A8ZWSS", "B003ELKNH2", "0767802519", "B003LR5BD0", "B0015OKWL2", "0783226845", "0783229526", "B000P0J0EW", "B0009A40ES", "B000EHSVRI", "B00CMDPT3Q", "B00AEBBA72", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B0041QSZS8", "B00441GYPG", "B004SIP9Z6", "B0034G4OSG", "B00005JLSB", "B002AF4Y9G", "B000093FLA", "B003ASLJQS", "B004FQX5B6", "B000A9QK6E", "B00003CWRX"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000C20VRS", "B0018CMJSU", "B000C20VPA", "B000P0J09M"]}, "price": 8.49, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 264032}, "asin": "0767802551", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518YHWH8AWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Donnie Brasco"}

{"description": "The Wild One(1953) was directed by Laslo Benedek and based on Frank Rooney's chilling short story \"Cyclists' Raid\" about a motorcycle gang taking over a small town. Props to Marlon Brando, by then an annual Oscar nominee, for agreeing to re-team with producer Stanley Kramer (who had produced the actor's debut film,The Men) on what is essentially a 79-minute B movie. His reward was to become the premier icon of 1950s rebellion, pioneering the way James Dean, Elvis Presley, and others would follow.The Wild Onealso introduced biker hipster patter to movie audiences and defined biker fashion for decades to come. So the movie is a cultural milestone--but hardly a cinematic one: it rarely escapes feeling schematic and overcautious in its fear of alienating the public on one hand and glorifying violence on the other. Lee Marvin injects a welcome shot of battery acid as the leader of a rival biker gang, and veteran cinematographer Hal Mohr does yeoman work on dull sets.--Richard T.

{"description": "Spencer Tracy's last performance was in this well-meaning, handsome film by Stanley Kramer about a pair of white parents (Tracy and Katharine Hepburn) trying to make sense of their daughter's impending marriage to an African American doctor (Sidney Poitier). The film has been knocked over the years for padding conflict and stoking easy liberalism by making Poitier's character in every socioeconomic sense a good catch: But what if Kramer had made this stranger a factory worker? Would the audience still find it as easy to accept a mixed-race relationship? But there's no denying the drawing power of this movie, which gets most of its integrity from the stirring performances of Tracy and Hepburn. When the former (who had been so ill that the production could not get completion insurance) gives a speech toward the end about race, love, and much else, it's impossible not to be affected by the last great moment in a great actor's life and career.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003L9C1", "B000XJD34I", "B00003L9CK", "B0044WUZXW", "B00AATGDW0", "B00007G1ZL", "B000056HEH", "B00005PJ6T", "B0000JBALO", "B0006Z2LLK", "B0046BHC28", "B000053VBJ", "B0000V499C", "B006FE83UE", "B00079Z9VO", "B00AEFXD1O", "B001K2KM82", "B002VWNIBI", "B00003L9CG", "B001QVE3HS", "B004K4FUT8", "B00007CVRT", "B0000714BT", "B0002Y4TJM", "B00008L3UQ", "B0068FZ0W4", "B0010AN7Z4", "B0045HCJQW", "B000GETTIE", "B0009RCPUW", "B00AKGG5WG", "B00871C09S", "B000ION7AI", "B0007TKNHE", "B0001CNRBG", "B0045HCJ94", "B0087ZG7Q6", "B002M2Z3BA", "B000ZM1MG4", "B0045HCJ9E", "B00005RERR", "B0010YSD7W", "B00005A06N", "B00005PJ6V", "6304907729", "B002CWKU36", "B001ECDVK4", "B00GICP84W", "B000P2A22O", "B00066FABM", "B008NNSD78", "B0000X61YQ", "B001KXZGO6", "B000UPMZ0I", "B000056HEB", "B00006RCO1", "B0000549B0", "B0000CBY1C", "B0087ZG7R0", "B0007IO6NM", "B0000W5J4A", "B0007QJ1XE", "B001LPWGGY", "B000WTVZHQ", "B00005MEOU", "B0009X75QU", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B007N31YH0", "B0000TWMQ6", "B00003Q433", "B00AEBB9FA", "B00AEFYK5M", "B00004XMV9", "B000CCW2TS", "B001LPWGH8", "B0000TWMRU", "B004J2FJC4", "B0000DJZ8Q", "B00BTYRB3U", "B004GJYR7I", "B0009X75WE", "B000056MMM", "B00007GZR1", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B000JJSJPK", "B0007TKNM4", "B007Y1NR1W", "B001KXZGNW", "B0045HCJ7G", "B00005JKF6", "B000CEXEWA", "B00AEFYRJQ", "B00AMEZDK6", "B0007TKNH4", "B001GUYAZY", "B000BOH922", "B002VWNIAY", "B000667HHW", "B00AJCUL0I", "B00005LOLA"], "bought_together": ["B00003L9C1", "B000XJD34I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003L9C1", "B002VWNIBI", "B000XJD34I", "B004K4FUT8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 63570}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 29.95, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "0767821483", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B6NS7Q3KL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"}

{"description": "An obvious attempt to cash in on the success ofJaws, this 1977 thriller was also based on a bestseller by Peter Benchley, and it features a memorable performance by Robert Shaw (the doomed shark hunter inJaws) in one of the last roles of his career. Looking very tanned and healthy, Nick Nolte and Jacqueline Bisset play a young couple enjoying a tropical vacation who discover a glass ampoule while scuba diving off the coast of Bermuda. It takes a seasoned treasure hunter (Shaw) to identify the ampoule as part of a valuable shipment of World War II morphine lost at sea, coincidentally, atop the even greater treasure of a sunken Spanish galleon. Thus begins a race for drugs and treasure pitting Nolte, Bisset, and Shaw against a ruthless drug lord (Louis Gossett Jr.) who'll do anything--even resort to Haitian voodoo--to get what he wants. It's all rather contrived and exploitative (after all, the movie's best known for Bisset's wet T-shirt scuba-dive), but as escapist entertainment goes it's got some exciting highlights including a moray eel that attacks on cue and... well, uh, Jacqueline Bisset in a wet T-shirt.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004YMATCY", "B007STBUHI", "B00008G8LY", "B0012KJ0DK", "B00005NKSZ", "0792844017", "B00005A8XX", "B00979KQD6", "B00008WFU4", "0783230516", "B0062KMDGG", "B00AEFYSR2", "0553140531", "B00407PNY2", "B0030VANHQ", "B00153ZR8G", "B00018D3ZA", "B00005LQ0I", "B00AEFYEU8", "B000KGGIVY", "B00BGQ2P9G", "B000M53GNG", "B0045HCJKS", "B000P0J0BU", "B000E5N684", "B00J2G4ZAY", "B00005JKU0", "B003ASLJRC", "B0001FGC1U", "B001RP974M", "B00005N5S3", "B00008WFU5", "B000EHSVNW", "B00005QCVP", "B000M69SJG", "B005ETALYW", "0767802497", "0790731932", "B00AEFYBA6", "B00LC4PCVU", "079073639X", "B000NQRR1G", "0767802470", "B0045HCJ8A", "B003ASLJPE", "B000MGTQ7U", "B006XMK11W", "6305213283", "B0008ENHTY", "0792838408", "B00008K76U", "B00CPTUOI2", "B0079ZWUCA", "B0007O38ZS", "B0013LL2Z2"], "bought_together": ["B007STBUHI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004TDTO", "B00005A8XX", "B00153ZR8G", "B000BYRCGU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 80595}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.75, "brand": "BISSET,JACQUELINE", "asin": "0767818067", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51D-CGOvhTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Deep"}

{"description": "Of the nine films Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers completed for RKO Pictures,Follow the Fleetfalls short of the top echelon. Coming between series peaksTop HatandSwing Time,Fleetrepeats the mistake (&agrave; laFlying Down to RioandRoberta) of casting Fred and Ginger as the comic couple, while the romantic roles went to Randolph Scott and Harriet Hilliard (before she went on to fame with her husband, Ozzie Nelson, inOzzie and Harriet). Fred puts down his top hat to become sailor Bake Baker (yet another of his alliterative screen names), while Ginger plays old flame Sherry Martin. The two are reunited when Fred takes shore leave in San Francisco, and soon their efforts turn to helping Ginger's sister Connie (Hilliard) land Fred's shipmate Bilge (Scott). (Look for Lucille Ball and Betty Grable in small roles.) Too much screen time is spent on Hilliard and Scott, but Fred and Ginger make up for it with plenty of laughs and some classic musical numbers, and Irving Berlin's score is one of the best of the series, with cunning lyrics and melodies that linger in the memory.

{"description": "The plotline may sound familiar: Two mismatched cops are assigned as reluctant partners to solve a crime. Culturally they are complete opposites, and they quickly realize they can't stand each other. One (Jackie Chan) believes in doing things by the book. He is a man with integrity and nerves of steel. The other (Chris Tucker) is an amiable rebel who can't stand authority figures. He's a man who has to do everything on his own, much to the displeasure of his superior officer, who in turn thinks this cop is a loose cannon but tolerates him because he gets the job done. Directed by Brett Ratner,Rush Hourdoesn't break any new ground in terms of story, stunts, or direction. It rehashes just about every \"buddy\" movie ever made--in fact, it makes films such asTango and Cashseem utterly original and clever by comparison. So, why did this uninspired movie make over $120 million at the box office? Was the whole world suffering from temporary insanity? Hardly. The explanation for the success ofRush Houris quite simple: chemistry. The casting of veteran action maestro Jackie Chan with the charming and often hilarious Chris Tucker was a serendipitous stroke of genius. Fans of Jackie Chan may be slightly disappointed by the lack of action set pieces that emphasize his kung-fu craft. On the other hand, those who know the history of this seasoned Hong Kong actor will be able to appreciate thatRush Hourwas the mainstream breakthrough that Chan had deserved for years. Coupled with the charismatic scene-stealer Tucker, Chan gets to flex his comic muscles to great effect. From their first scenes together to the trademark Chan outtakes during the end credits, their ability to play off of one another is a joy to behold, and this mischievous interaction is what saves the film from slipping into the depths of pitiful mediocrity.--Jeremy Storey", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CY5X", "B000059XYJ", "B00005JL8Y", "6302091632", "B00006G8LB", "B00000JGEK", "6300213730"], "bought_together": ["B00003CY5X"], "also_viewed": ["B00003CY5X", "B00005JL8Y", "B000WGYMTC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 400219}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0780623711", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514DYRWFBKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rush Hour [VHS]"}

{"description": "Theatrically released in 1991 asHighlander II: The Quickening, this sequel was later reedited and gained a small but loyal following (prompting a spinoff TV series), but at the time of its release critic Roger Ebert called it &quot;the most hilariously incomprehensible movie ... almost awesome in its badness.&quot; In other words, you might find some guilty pleasure in this chaotic sequel to 1986'sHighlander, in which Christopher Lambert reprises his role as Connor MacLeod, a member of the alien race known as &quot;Immortals,&quot; banished to Earth from his home planet Zeist some 500 years ago. In the year 1999, Lambert owns a corporation that has created a shield to protect the Earth following the depletion of the ozone layer. But the shield is seized by an evil cartel, and Virginia Madsen plays a scientist who assists MacLeod in his mission to destroy the cartel. Sean Connery also reprises his role fromHighlanderas the Scottish Immortal named Ramirez (?!), but by the time he starts engaging in dashing swordplay you may wonder if he's wandered in from another movie altogether.Highlanderfans welcomed the laserdisc and DVD release of this &quot;renegade&quot; director's cut, which attempts to clarify the original version's confusing plot.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004U7MQY2", "B004U7MQYC", "B001JFZ118", "B0010YVCAM", "B000NOKAK8", "B0007DA3V6", "B00092A1J4", "B000OYCMNU", "B001URA5W0", "B000LP6L2U", "B001AQO3XS", "B00006LPCK", "B0001BKBGQ", "B00HEPDGKA", "B00005O5B6", "B00009MEJT", "B0000CABIJ", "B00020HCBI", "0790738511", "B008JFUS0U", "B00IKM5LXG", "B0085A9HU6", "B0001ZX0GA", "B0001NBLYK", "B004P7CMDM", "0783225741", "B00J4LMHMK", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00EKUXDSW", "B00004WEJZ", "B008JFUNHI", "B00J9BZ4KC", "B0000640VR", "B001B3LIOC", "B00070FX5U", "B00006RCOC", "B005LAIGW8", "B005LAII44", "B00005N5S5", "6304711891", "B0013RF25M", "B001FB55HQ", "B00003CXIV", "B00004Y631", "B0090SI56Y", "B0001A9I5W", "B001BEK8HO", "B0053TWVIM", "B00004STDN", "B0000VD12I", "B003L20IEW", "B000UW1NKE", "B0000VCZK2", "6304936532", "B00A2H9OSK", "B000QUCRB4", "B000M2DLJ8", "6305558167", "B003QO8TOQ", "B000AYELFQ", "0783225814", "1573624667", "B00BUAEYVK", "B000P7V4R6", "0783226888", "B00AIBZKV0", "B005LS4MQY", "B000VI70QS", "6304712499", "B0045HCJ9O", "B004LWZW4M", "B00004TJJV", "B00HDU9UOW", "0783114885", "0767817710", "B000E6ESEY", "B0045HCIWM", "B0045HCJRG", "B00GJNQ4B6", "6305245487", "B002O3Z4WK", "B0000844I8", "B0006UEVUE", "630469654X", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00009ATIM", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B0000524EB", "0783226063", "B0001Z37HM", "B00003CXC5", "B000U1ZV8K", "B0050ODZ6M", "B00008G8M4", "B000LC4Z7Q", "B004EPYZT4", "B00008WFU5", "076780970X", "B00F3L8P26"], "bought_together": ["B001JFZ118", "B004U7MQY2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001JFZ118", "B004U7MQY2", "B004U7MQYC", "B0010YVCAM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 273607}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0782008380", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516F7VY0HCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Highlander II: Renegade Version"}

{"description": "The 1963 film that inspired a popular television series about a chatty,  lovable dolphin gets a sunny makeover in this 1996 update. Elijah Wood plays  Sandy, a bleak adolescent from Chicago struggling with the recent divorce of  his parents and wanting only to immerse himself in familiar comforts.  Instead, Sandy is sent to Coral Key, an island off Australia, to spend a  summer with his Uncle Porter (Paul Hogan), a benevolent old fisherman. The  sights and pleasures of the island, including a pretty neighbor named Kim  (Jessica Wesson), aren't enough to shake off Sandy's gloomy outlook. But when  he meets Flipper while boating with Porter, his morale improves considerably,  then gets another boost when Flipper develops a loyal attachment to him. A  subplot about a crooked charter-boat company dumping toxic waste off the  coast feels like a necessary evil, just to give the screenwriter something to  do. Other than that, the film is quite fun and charming, and Hogan is a  pleasure to see with his cracker-barrel wisdom. Great fun all around for ages 6 and up.--Tom  Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303394345", "6304171277", "B00006FDFG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 428891}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0783219148", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518M48CMBZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Flipper [VHS]"}

{"description": "John Wayne and Kirk Douglas make a delightful duo in this comedic Western in which Wayne seeks revenge on a ruthless mine owner (Bruce Cabot) who had him framed and sent to prison. Upon his release, Wayne recruits Douglas in a scheme to raid and rob one of Cabot's gold-laden wagons, despite the fact that Douglas had been offered good money to kill Wayne. He joins Wayne instead (the potential profits being much greater), and they set out to ambush the War Wagon, so named because it's heavily armored, mounted with a Gatling gun, and guarded by a dozen gunmen on horses. Costarring Keenan Wynn and Howard Keel as a wise-cracking Indian,The War Wagonwas a Western precursor to the action buddy films of the 1980s and '90s, serving up plenty of exciting action and constant comic relief. The interplay between Wayne and Douglas is sharp and sarcastic, and their motley crew of accomplices provides yet another source of character-driven humor. Not one of the greatest Westerns ever made, but certainly one of the most lightly entertaining.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008CMR6", "B000O599YE", "B00008CMR4", "B00AEFXUL2", "B00008MTW5", "B000O599Y4", "078322592X", "B00008MTW7", "B0045HCJSK", "B000O59A0C", "B000ANVPP6", "0783230478", "B00008MTW6", "B000O599NK", "B00AEBBA0E", "B000ANVPPQ", "B000O599YO", "B00AEFXSVE", "B000059TFU", "B0082LUFA4", "B00AEBB8YM", "B000O599WQ", "B000O599NA", "B00AEFY6ZQ", "B00005ASGH", "B00AEFYBA6", "B00C6QYMJG", "B000O599YY", "B000U1ZV6M", "B00AEFYL6K", "6304696612", "B0009ML2JC", "B000O599ZS", "B001PO54OM", "B000O599US", "B009YX8MSG", "B00008CMT3", "B00008CMT4", "B0015TJBXW", "B000O599VM", "B0009ML2KQ", "B00004ZBVE", "B000BPL2FG", "B000O599W6", "B0007MAO0C", "B00BFWKE62", "B001PO55LE", "B006VRRGOO", "B000O599XU", "B000O77LY2", "B000O599N0", "B001R0AY9Y", "B000O599NU", "B00005JLV5", "B000O599X0", "B0018O4RT2", "B003ASLJS6", "B00005N89K", "B0001FVDX2", "B00BTYU3UI", "B00393SG0G", "B000O599Z8", "B000BPL2HO", "B00005N5S3", "B00AEFYPHA", "B00AMQGFYM", "B000N3SSBW", "B006PA0TRI", "B0047BXR94", "B003ASLJRC", "B005FUTC2W", "B0007TKNGA", "B000056H2H", "B00008CMR1", "B004DY1VIO", "0783230400", "B000O599MG", "B00AEBB932", "B000OT6V0U", "0783228007", "B00005LOL0", "B007KFZ7Y2", "B000O599M6", "B00BGQ2P9G", "B000BITVBA", "B000O599LW", "B000059TFW", "B006PA19VS", "B000FTCLQC", "B00195I3OK", "B000E5N6KW", "B00C3ALLFS", "B004GSVX8A", "B00008CMT1", "B000FZETR0", "B000O179JK", "B000H9AD5G", "B000O599ZI", "B004TJ1H3W", "B003ASLJNQ"], "bought_together": ["B00008CMR4", "B00008CMR6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007KFZ7Y2", "B00008CMR6", "078322592X", "B00AEFXUL2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7286}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.35, "brand": "WAYNE,JOHN", "asin": "0783228031", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51cUCsOWQ6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The War Wagon"}
{"description": "With its high-intensity plot about an attempt to assassinate French President Charles de Gaulle, the bestselling novel by Frederick Forsyth was a prime candidate for screen adaptation. Director Fred Zinnemann brought his veteran skills to bear on what has become a timeless classic of screen suspense. Not to be confused with the later remakeThe Jackalstarring Bruce Willis (which shamelessly embraced all the bombast that Zinnemann so wisely avoided), this 1973 thriller opts for lethal elegance and low-key tenacity in the form of the Jackal, the suave assassin played with consummate British coolness by Edward Fox. He's a killer of the highest order, a master of disguise and international elusiveness, and this riveting film follows his path to de Gaulle with an intense, straightforward documentary style. Perhaps one of the last great films from a bygone age of pure, down-to-basics suspense (and a kind of debonair European alternative to the American grittiness ofThe French Connection),The Day of the Jackalis a cat-and-mouse thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat until its brilliantly executed final scene (pardon the pun), by which time Fox has achieved cinematic immortality as one of the screen's most memorable killers.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00441GYYC", "B00005QCVP", "B004IFYMXO", "B004OB2EYQ", "B0074B2N58", "B003O7I6SE", "B0007ZEOQE", "B000HT3PBU", "B00005JP3T", "B00000K3C9", "B000PFUAPK", "B000E5N6KW", "B003AWRMCO", "B00FNR9ZKG", "B00008AOTO", "0451239377", "B0006B2A42", "B000MGTQ7U", "B004IFYMXE", "0792838408", "B0003JANSW", "0792844017", "B000EHSVS2", "B0015YY768", "B001EOQCJE", "B000CEXEWA", "B005HQBO9I", "B00441GYOM", "B000H1RFSM", "B00AEFXLKC", "B000A2WJBQ", "B0070MZ0G0", "B000056HEA", "B00004XPPC", "B00096S4B2", "B00004RF83", "B0045HCIZE", "B0001NBMH6", "B000FP2OP4", "B005DTZXMI", "B00DOZNJ2Y", "B000066C6H", "B000NQQ4I8", "B00008OE4W", "B00FNRA10E", "B00AEFYBA6", "B004UOHNAC", "B00061QJ8A", "B00005N5S2", "B00008MTVZ", "B00006ADD5", "B00AEFYPHA", "B0007TKNM4", "B0002HOEQ2", "B004I1K066", "B0008ENHTO", "B000NO1XJA", "B00008AOTR", "B005DXCO94", "B00008V6Y1", "B00049QQJQ", "B007N31YH0", "B00005JKFR", "B0006UEVVS", "B00JPQ1IJM", "B0014BQR1A", "B000062XEX", "B000SK5Z70"], "bought_together": ["B00441GYYC", "B00005QCVP"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00441GYYC", "B003O7I6SE", "B00CVDNJ7A", "B00005QCVP"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10482}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.88, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

{"description": "Jan Morrow (Doris Day) and Brad Allen (Rock Hudson) have never met, but they're sworn enemies because of one small appliance in their lives: the telephone. The two share a party line, and Jan is outraged over the amount of time Bill spends wooing women over the phone. A convenient triangle emerges when a client (Tony Randall) of Jan's--she's an interior decorator--falls in love with her and happens to be Brad's old college chum. When Brad makes the connection, he decides to try to court Jan himself, to make her more sympathetic to his phone woes. Of course, she'd never go for such a heel, so he passes himself off as Rex Stetson, a Texas rancher visiting New York. The ensuing tale, albeit predictable, is lots of fun, with some quick-witted dialogue and some clever use of split-screens for the phone calls.  Thelma Ritter is hilarious as Jan's always-hung-over maid, Alma; and the pairing of Rock and Doris works beautifully, as always.--Jenny Brown", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001CNRB6", "B00CZ7AL32", "B00007GZR0", "B00007GZR1", "B000JJSJPK", "B0007QS30G", "B0007QS2ZC", "B0007TKHFW", "B00009IB1F", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B001MBTSTA", "B00070HK2Y", "B000MGBLPK", "B000MGBLQE", "B0007QS2Z2", "B00IPL2CP2", "B000JJSJPA", "B00C3ALLFS", "B000056BOR", "B00008CMRN", "B000WTVZHQ", "B0001WTWVU", "B0009X75WE", "B00AEBB97S", "B00EL6ABL2", "B000P2A22O", "B000XT1P5C", "B0007QS2ZM", "B0045HCJHG", "B004GJYR7I", "B00005JLZW", "B0045HCJ9E", "B00AEBB8OC", "B000286S2E", "B0045HCJQW", "B00871C09S", "B0000DD77V", "B00005A06N", "B0001WTWS8", "B00023P4RO", "B006TTC5WC", "B0009X75QU", "B000W089XS", "B00023P4RE", "B0002HOEQ2", "B00006RCO1", "B001O2UTRW", "B002DQMXEU", "B00AKGG5WG", "B009YX8MSG", "B0090XLDKY", "B000CCW2TS", "B001GUYAZY", "B000JF5TXO", "B000EHQU08", "B006H37P5C", "B00DTISNBI", "B00K2CHUWW", "B0007TKGY4", "6304765266", "B00347AIMG", "B00AEFXLBQ", "B0010AN7Z4", "B0045HCJ7G", "B00A1AU6ZI", "B00008MTYC", "B004K4FUT8", "B0047CG9F2", "B000JU8HBA", "B00AMEZDK6", "B00AEFXSVE", "B0000DD780", "B007TYI7YQ", "B008D1Q1VU", "B00AEBB8YW", "B0007US7FI", "B0045HCJ76", "B005H8G78O", "B00AATV046", "B00C3ALLSA", "B001D8W7EK", "B0045HCJJY", "B002HK9IDQ", "B000JJSJP0", "B001QYOSEI", "B0009HLD3C", "B00I9BU5ZM", "6305236569", "B0015FGCI8", "B000ION7AI", "B00K6J7Q1Q", "B000YDBPAM", "B001D8W7EU", "B004XWGYV0", "B006TTC5Y0", "B00GOC752E", "B001LPWGH8", "0767821556", "B004KN3NXE", "B000ZM1MG4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000P2A22O", "B000JJSJPK", "B00007GZR1", "B00CZ7AL32"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 228299}, "asin": "0783233469", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y26S8VJHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pillow Talk"}

{"description": "Suffering from the extreme bad luck of being released at the same time as the low-budgetThe Blair Witch Project, this adaptation ofThe Haunting of Hill Houseattempts to update Shirley Jackson's psychologically terrifying ghost story to the era of big-budget, computerized special effects. Does it work? Well, let's just say that showing isn't exactly the same as telling. A prime example of bloated studio filmmaking,The Hauntingtelegraphs all its frights so blatantly that it forsakes any of Jackson's subtle horrors for the remedial scares of a clunky carnival ride. The story remains basically the same, with four people called to an old mansion for experiments in the supernatural, but instead of getting inside the heads of its main characters (as the 1963 adaptation by Robert Wise did so well), Jan DeBont's film deserts character development for the huge, glorious set design provided by Eugenio Zanetti (Restoration). Thus, instead of a well-drawn story you get... a well-drawn house, one that four very talented and underutilized actors--Lili Taylor, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Liam Neeson, and Owen Wilson--wander around in endlessly (as Zeta-Jones puts it, the house is \"sort of Charles Foster Kane meets the Munsters\"). Taylor, as the hypersensitive Nell, is the unknowing lynchpin in the battle between good and bad ghosts and gets saddled with most of the expository dialogue of the mansion's gothic backstory. Zeta-Jones (showing some spark) and Neeson (showing none) are sadly reduced to providing reactionary shots of the film's disastrous climax, which mixes hapless new-age affirmations with computer-generated effects of ghosts and exploding windows, walls, doors, etc. For this haunted-house story, take a quick tour of the breathtaking rooms, but definitelydon'tstay the night.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CWRF", "B00005UQ9W", "B0045HCJJE", "B000063US5", "B003VA3JUO", "B002AS45VK", "B00AEBBA2W", "B0000C2IQQ", "B00005LIRD", "B002GHHHL0", "B00AEBBA72", "B00K2CHY1Y", "078322799X", "B004SIP92O", "B000V4UFZK", "B00AEFYXQI", "B00BEIYMAG", "B000CCBC9O", "B001BSBBGC", "B00E32PJ02", "B0000AOX0D", "B000UUX2Z0", "B000HC2LFI", "B0021L8UFI", "B00009PY4G", "0767824954", "B0010X73ZG", "B00AEBB91E", "0800177029", "B00AEFYYH6", "B0008191WO", "B00000IQVQ", "B00008LUNW", "B00003CXKM", "6305718954", "B00005JNY3", "B0002DB54A", "B004LWZW24", "B002VWNIDG", "B00DBNLBAQ", "0783116926", "B000GBEWRU", "0783225482", "B00AIBZLVY", "B004AC6PV2", "B0001FR3IQ", "B000GCFO0I", "B000NOIVT0", "B001B1872U", "B004P7CNUY", "B00004BZIY", "B00005JNBN", "B0009X763M", "B000NQRR1Q", "B00006FDCD", "B000AM6OQ2", "B00005O5B5", "0792839684", "B0000694XX", "B00000JQB5", "0780622650", "6305017115", "B003498SCQ", "1573625779", "B001B8XRT6", "B00000IQC4", "B00AEFXPMG", "6305300801", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00006AUIG", "B000TJ6PBK", "B0006SGYL0", "B004SIP9MY", "B001P3SA9Y", "B00023P4TM", "6305090564", "B000AM4P9K", "B00JPS7HOA", "B00B96TGQS", "B003UGLCIA", "B005LAIGOQ", "B004SIP9O2", "B00DZP1C9K", "B000ARXF96", "B004LWZW2O", "6305767866", "B002945DUW", "B000RIWAVW", "B000FFJYBG", "B00005JOWW", "B005TK23PQ", "B004XVMCN0", "B009XTF8KQ", "B001CFEC2Y", "B00006IUFV", "B00317LM8S", "B0021L8UPS", "B008874968", "6305428042", "B008JFUS0U"], "bought_together": ["B000063US5"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BTYXNRI", "B0045HCJJE", "B000ASATYO", "0783116926"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18281}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.84, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "0783237413", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51aYQx70GGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Haunting"}

{"description": "Set in Harlem and New Orleans in 1955, this supernatural thriller stirred a brief controversy when released in 1987 because some scenes featuring Lisa Bonet (then a popular cast member ofThe Cosby Show) were considered too sexually explicit to be rated R.

Rourke's investigation leads him into an underworld of voodoo and forbidden desires, and as the mystery unfolds director Alan Parker fills every scene with conspicuous style and atmospheric excess, compelling critic Pauline Kael to observe that, &quot;Parker simply doesn't have the gift of making evil seductive, and he edits like a flasher.&quot; And yet, this movie does cast a spell of its own (Roger Ebert's review was considerably more charitable), and the performances of Rourke, De Niro, Bonet, and Charlotte Rampling are well suited to the ominous mood.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000AOX0E", "B003TRMLQM", "B0007VZ99E", "B002AS463W", "B00006JMPS", "B000059TFP", "B00005JKI5", "B0045HCJSU", "B002DYYGO2", "1453271139", "B00007EFIJ", "B000068IEX", "B00007BK2R", "B002CTJW0G", "B0009R1TI6", "B00004RE27", "B004LYWPZE", "B001U0HB5Q", "B00005V9HX", "0790750198", "B000HC2LHG", "B001TOD92C", "1573623857", "076782170X", "6305132917", "B00005JKJA", "0767830555", "B0006GAOJA", "B0000AOX0A", "B0001FGBW0", "6305238065", "6305308837", "B00008DDVY", "B000286RP2", "B003KV3E2C", "B0000DI87S", "6305262268", "B000E5N684", "B00005BCKG", "B000A2UBN4", "B0000542CH", "B000GGSMC6", "B0028OH568", "B0052ADPAU", "0859653862", "6305065551", "B000069HZO", "B000056PNL", "0783228457", "B000CR76U8", "B0045HCIYA", "B000TGJ80S", "0783225903", "B002VWNICC", "B0002KQNKE", "B00008CMRK", "B000NA1WEK", "B0019BI1DM", "6304936532", "B00008O38F", "B0002KPHZG", "B000ICL3NI", "B000P0J0AG", "B000QQFKYE", "B000063JDE", "B00008L3S6", "B001J710Y8", "079073219X", "B0041QSZM4", "B00E8G5HXM", "B00006RCNV", "6305177937", "B00827OWO8", "B000ZM1MGE", "B0024FADD8", "B00005V4XV", "B0056GLNLI", "B00096S48U", "B007XF0W3K", "B000059LGL", "B00007L4KF", "B00AEFXW8I", "0792833287", "B0045HCJTO", "B00013RC66", "B0006Z2LH4", "B00006L92U", "B0055CP9TU", "B00005LC4D", "B00005B6L0", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B00AEFXR8I", "B0013D8LKO", "B00003CXCF", "B000YENUI6", "B0002KPIQY", "B0016I0AJG", "B0043X1FNQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002AS463W", "B003TRMLQM", "B0041QSZTW", "6305065551"]}, "price": 12.08, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 295510}, "asin": "078401115X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51V7MKFPHCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Angel Heart"}
{"description": "The only real problem withStir of Echoeshas nothing to do with the movie itself, but with unlucky coincidence. Adapted from a Richard Mathesonnovel, this film  arrived around the same time asThe Sixth Sense, and surface similarities made it suffer by cursory comparison and the competing film's phenomenal success. It's a pity, because this one features one of Kevin Bacon's best performances, in a psychological thriller that makes a lot more right moves than wrong ones. Bacon plays a blue-collar guy who laments his ordinary life, only to learn, when his sister-in-law (Ileanna Douglas) hypnotizes him, that he is a \"receiver\" capable of seeing spirits and split-second glimpses of past and future events. It's a torturous gift to have--especially since his friendly Chicago neighborhood possesses a dark secret--and Bacon plays the role with an appropriate mixture of obsession and internalized torment.Similarity toThe Sixth Senseapplies only to the basic premise and the character of Bacon's young son. Otherwise, this is more of a hard-edged journey of self-discovery, marital crisis, and recovery, with Bacon's wife (played by the highly underrated Kathryn Erbe) involved in an underdeveloped subplot about a group of people who share Bacon's gift as paranormal \"receivers.\" Furthering his career as a writer-director of intelligent thrillers, David Koepp makes a few missteps in pacing and thematic overkill, but overallStir of Echoesis a sharp, sensitive thriller that unfolds to reveal a dramatically satisfying solution to its mystery.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBBA2W", "B00004BZIY", "B00006AUJR", "B000VKKV3K", "B004SIP92O", "0800177789", "B00005JNY3", "6305718954", "B00007AJE1", "B000TJ6PBK", "B0001FR3IQ", "B00003CXKA", "B00AEFYYH6", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B0000648X0", "B002NZK5RI", "B00005JL3T", "0783222149", "B000V4UFZK", "B003VA3JUO", "B00003CWRF", "B000HT38IK", "B00009WVSL", "B0097C046W", "B00005JH9M", "B00008DDGY", "0783116926", "B004LWZW24", "B004AC6PV2", "B00008EY9G", "B0009X763M", "0783226837", "B0021L8UFI", "0783240295", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00011CZRE", "B00005UQ9W", "B004EPYZO4", "B002DKGWSE", "B0021L8UXA", "B0024FADD8", "B003ASLJQS", "6305161933", "155890848X", "B0001GF2D8", "B00064LJVE", "B009XTF8KQ", "B000Y7U97I", "B002GHHHN8", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00005JKZH", "B002JT69IW", "0767817737", "B00AEFYF2K", "6304711891", "B00KU2ZKKI", "0792840127", "B005LAIGOQ", "B001KKU9CI", "B001JNNDJM", "B00AZTUUQK", "B000U7169M", "B00026ZD04", "B002VWNIDG", "B002O3Z4WK", "B00AJLHUA8", "B003L20IEW", "B0002IQLHQ", "B000AM4P9K", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00IJS2OR2", "B00009PY4G", "B000OVLBGM", "B001BP4K22", "B001R3YRG2", "B0002234LS", "B0000694XX", "B00B96TGQS", "B002AT8K9W", "B000NIVJF4", "B000HC2LFI", "6305065551", "B00AIBZKV0", "B00013RC7K", "B004SUDQDG", "0792159659", "B000GFLKF8", "B0021L8UPS", "B00AEBB91E", "B000PMLJMQ", "B0001IMCFC", "B002NZK5SM", "6305428115", "B000LP6KNU", "B00006FDCD", "6304806434", "B00AEFXKZ8", "B008Y1YK7G", "B0006SGYL0"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBBA2W", "B00004BZIY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004SIP92O", "B004AC6PWG", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00004BZIY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 163731}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.99, "brand": "Lions Gate", "asin": "0784013470", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71YSZMKZKXL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Stir of Echoes"}

As with the firstBatmanfeature, director Tim Burton brings his distinct visual style to the frantic action, but this time there's a darker malevolence lurking beneath all that extraordinary production design.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000P0J06K", "B001OST0LW", "B001OST0M6", "B00005JNJV", "B004LWZWGA", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00005LOUK", "B000IJ79WU", "B001ECDVKE", "B000IJ79XE", "B0000959N0", "B0006L0LOS", "B000IJ79X4", "B000A9QKLO", "B00AEBBA72", "B0000VD04M", "B0000AC8LI", "B000IJ79UW", "B00008G8M5", "B004LWZWFQ", "B000A9QKL4", "B004LWZW42", "B008JFUPFI", "B000AYELVA", "B001CDR1FG", "B001AGXEAG", "B000J10EQU", "B001DHXT20", "B00005JMQW", "B002VWNIDG", "B004SIP9O2", "B004YJMQHI", "B0087ZG7NO", "B000AQOHNA", "B000AYELVU", "B00005JKCH", "B00GZ0ML2Y", "B00005JNTU", "B000UR9T8C", "B001VLBDD0", "B00DP9MDE4", "B001CK1D44", "B00AEBBAEK", "B000A9QKLE", "B007K3JFUQ", "B000VI70QS", "B00004Y87O", "B009JBWOU0", "B002GHHHOM", "B00005JKWJ", "B001QB9H1U", "B003UGLCIA", "B00007AJGH", "B0009UZG28", "B004SIP9P6", "B000035Z5H", "B00A2LFXVI", "0780630890", "B0000696I0", "B004EPZ07K", "B001OQCV6A", "B000VR0570", "B004EPYZT4", "B000OT6V64", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000RIWAVW", "6304698739", "B000O77SRC", "B000IJ79VQ", "B0014Z4ON4", "0780624890", "B004SIP6WW", "B005LAIH54", "B00003CY5Y", "B0000VCZMK", "6305869103", "B0001BKAEY", "B0090SI56Y", "B000068MBS", "B004SIP9MY", "B00AEBB9NM", "B0001GOH6Q", "B004LWZW4M", "B000GETUDI", "B000B7QCGS", "B000CSTK42", "B000FFJYBG", "B008JFUS0U", "B000RW3VCK", "B005LAIHYU", "B00005T7I2", "B0000B00KB", "B00E5I2M6I", "B001DTPZNY", "B004P7CN7W", "B001BGS17Q", "B001AJIHC8", "B005COPWZW", "B005G4TJUC", "B001QTXM5Y"], "bought_together": ["B000P0J06K", "B001OST0LW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002GSXKN8", "B000P0J06K", "B00005JNJV", "B001OST0LW"]}, "price": 8.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 142329}, "asin": "0790730960", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41SK0R2QFEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Batman Returns (1992)"}

{"description": "Martin Scorsese's 1990 masterpieceGoodFellasimmortalizes the hilarious, horrifying life of actual gangster Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), from his teen years on the streets of New York to his anonymous exile under the Witness Protection Program. The director's kinetic style is perfect for recounting Hill's ruthless rise to power in the 1950s as well as his drugged-out fall in the late 1970s; in fact, no one has ever rendered the mental dislocation of cocaine better than Scorsese. Scorsese uses period music perfectly, not just to summon a particular time but to set a precise mood.GoodFellasis at least as good asThe Godfatherwithout being in the least derivative of it. Joe Pesci's psycho improvisation of Mobster Tommy DeVito ignited Pesci as a star, Lorraine Bracco scores the performance of her life as the love of Hill's life, and every supporting role, from Paul Sorvino to Robert De Niro, is a miracle.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000C20VPA", "B000C20VRS", "B008R65XYC", "B000M341QE", "B0018CMJSU", "B0019L770A", "B0019L21GA", "B00004XPPB", "B000P0J0AG", "B0000DI87S", "B000P0J0EW", "B00003CXWV", "B00CCMKPO0", "B00G1C2URC", "B00004U103", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004SIP95G", "B002CPMB9O", "B0019L21H4", "B007TBIUSM", "B000286RP2", "B00011CZRE", "B004SIP8ZM", "B0006GAOJA", "B002T9H2LA", "B006TTC5HC", "B002VWNIEA", "0767830555", "B0000AMJEK", "B0000AM6JI", "B00005V9HH", "B004FQX5B6", "B000SFOW8I", "B00008975Z", "B002CA68N4", "6305313687", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00013RC2U", "0792174909", "B007D0FVRM", "B000A7DVR2", "B004G7XCRQ", "B002QEHPQU", "B003ASLJO0", "B000LP6KNU", "B000H5TH20", "B000P0J09C", "6305263248", "0783229526", "B00009W5CA", "B001C0I61M", "B000EHSVRI", "B00IEK9U0E", "B002ZG980U", "B004SIP7TE", "B004SIP7ZS", "B0006GAO5Y", "B00B0U2SFE", "B000ERVKBC", "B000A2UBN4", "B002AF4Y9G", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B0000714BS", "B000E5KQHI", "B00005JA8B", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B003AWRMCE", "B000P0J0EM", "1558908390", "B00080ZG10", "0767802519", "B003ELKNH2", "B003BV8I3Q", "B000035Z5G", "B00AEFXDO6", "B000E8NRBC", "B00000JGHV", "B00004RJ71", "B00AEBB9CS", "B004SIP93S", "B00AEFYSEA", "B004SIP6WW", "B003ASLJQS", "B0001Z4OXS", "B002VWNIDG", "0783225946", "B00AEBB9ZK", "B00AEFXXMI", "B0000A02TZ", "B000MZHW40", "B004SIP6GI", "B002ZG99N6", "B00AEBB95K", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00BB67UNW", "B00029RTAI", "B000P0J0D8", "B003ASLJOU", "B000Z8GZYW", "B003ASLJS6"], "bought_together": ["B000C20VPA", "B000C20VRS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000M341QE", "B0018CMJSU", "B000P0J0EW", "B00BCB1JJW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 120285}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.49, "brand": "WARNER STUDIOS", "asin": "0790729725", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YHNBJW24L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "GoodFellas"}
{"description": "Stanley Kubrick'sThe Shiningis less an adaptation of Stephen King's bestselling horror novel than a complete reimagining of it from the inside out. In King's book, the Overlook Hotel is a haunted place that takes possession of its off-season caretaker and provokes him to murderous rage against his wife and young son. Kubrick's movie is an existential Road Runner cartoon (his steadicam scurrying through the hotel's labyrinthine hallways), in which the cavernously empty spaces inside the Overlook mirror the emptiness in the soul of the blocked writer, who's settled in for a long winter's hibernation. As many have pointed out, King's protagonist goes mad, but Kubrick's Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is Looney Tunes from the moment we meet him--all arching eyebrows and mischievous grin. (Both Nicholson and Shelley Duvall reach new levels of hysteria in their performances, driven to extremes by the director's fanatical demands for take after take after take.)The Shiningis terrifying--but not in the way fans of the novel might expect. When it was redone as a TV miniseries (reportedly because of King's dissatisfaction with the Kubrick film), the famous topiary-animal attack (which was deemed impossible to film in 1980) was there--but the deeper horror was lost. Kubrick'sThe Shininggets under your skin and chills your bones; it stays with you, inhabits you, haunts you. And there's no place to hide...--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300267881", "0790734079", "B00005ATQA", "6302038308", "6300182770", "B0009RRUKW", "0783235607", "0783228317", "B00000J2KZ", "B00004RNAC", "0790736039", "B00023NRSM", "6304508611", "6300182878", "6302921058", "6304509154", "0783216084", "6300214087", "B00004W5UA", "6301427076", "630268644X", "B000003KHS", "B000AMW2TK", "0790700506", "6300181340", "6300214753", "6302054982", "0784011923", "6305363668", "6303686796", "6305095566", "630021639X", "6302822688", "6305576173", "0783246641", "6304994540", "6303953425", "B00004U8PA", "0792158261", "0792100085", "6300213986", "6300189015", "630533577X", "6300214826", "0792846303", "6304288433", "6300147630", "0792842111", "B000007OY0", "0790741512", "6302158176", "0792846311", "6300183416", "0800103106", "B000005PFL", "6300183211", "0790733927", "6301666569", "6301871952", "0767825411", "630339406X", "6303109950", "6300216500", "6300214192", "6300262731", "6303257674", "6304214502", "630018627X", "6300214311", "1558807381", "0792839234", "0767819187", "B00005B238", "0790731975", "6303579388", "B000059HFB", "6302798450", "B00000FZCU", "6303651461", "6303566391", "6302642175", "6301971582", "6300218058", "6301094352", "6300184064", "6300181278", "6304457383", "6300214672", "6300262855", "0800125762", "6303257305"], "bought_together": ["0790734079"], "also_viewed": ["6300147630", "6300182878", "B00005ATQA", "6300189015", "6300267881", "B00023NRSM", "6300213005", "6303953425", "0307743659", "6303148352", "0790734079", "B001AQT0Z4", "6300183211", "0784011923", "B00BBND56G", "0788806270"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 268792}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0790705141", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5106FV0S4PL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Shining [VHS]"}

{"description": "In the fourth and reportedly final film of theLethal Weaponseries, director Richard Donner reunites with Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, who reprise their roles as Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh for one last hurrah in a film that is decidedly better than the third and first chapters. This time the pair are pitted against Jet Li, who plays the leader of a Chinese  organized crime unit. Li, a veteran of hundreds of Hong Kong action films, more than holds his own against the more established team of Gibson, Glover, Renee Russo, and Joe Pesci with his subtle yet strong portrayal of the quietly irrepressible Wah Sing Ku. As always with theLethalseries, the plot is incredibly simple to follow: someone steals something, someone gets killed, and Murtaugh is reluctantly thrown into the mix while Riggs dives into the case with gleeful aplomb. As with the previous movies, we watch for the sheer action and chemistry alone. The action sequences throughout the fourth installment are exquisite, from the opening scene involving a flamethrower, a burning building, and a half-naked Murtaugh strutting like a chicken (don't ask, just watch), to the climactic showdown that pays genuine tribute to Jet Li's masterful martial art skills. As for chemistry, the bond between these characters is so strong by now that you sometimes feel like you're watching a TV series in its sixth season, such is the warm familiarity between the audience and the personalities on the screen. The humor is more fluid than ever, aided immeasurably by the casting of comedian Chris Rock, who like Li does a great job of making his presence known in some memorable verbal tirades that would bring a smile out of the Farrelly brothers. But it's the verbal and emotional jousting between Glover and Gibson that makes this fourth episode especially appealing; both are in peak form with great physical and verbal timing. One can only hope that if this is indeed the last of theLethalfilms, that it won't be the last time we see Glover and Gibson together on screen.--Jeremy Storey", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300271331", "6302596092", "6301572688", "6301017080", "B000U1ZV8K", "6304681496", "6304007523", "6302765536", "B00004XPQ6", "6302091632", "6304932553", "080010367X"], "bought_together": ["6300271331", "6302596092"], "also_viewed": ["6301572688", "6302596092", "6300271331"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 396077}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.18, "brand": "", "asin": "0790738945", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516WCCP833L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lethal Weapon 4"}

{"description": "Just Causeis a film that relies on phony plot twists and steals openly from any other thriller that it can remember. If there was a drinking game requiring players to drink during every cinematic \"homage,\" you'd be tanked afterJust Cause's first 45&nbsp;minutes. Take one case of racial injustice, place it in an exotic, exquisitely photographed location (the Florida Everglades), and bring in an outsider, played by a bankable star, to save the day. Make sure nothing appears as it seems. Add a couple of plot twists, some over-the-top character actors (Ed Harris, shamelessly riffing on Hannibal Lecter), stir, and serve. The big name in this case is Sean Connery, who plays a Harvard law professor summoned to the swamps by an apparently innocent death row inmate (Blair Underwood), who swears he didn't rape and kill that 11-year-old girl. He says he confessed because maverick psycho-cop Tanny Brown (Laurence Fishburne) made him play a solo game of Russian roulette. He says his Serial-killer neighbor on death row (Harris) committed the crime. Connery buys it, the audience buys it, and how could they not? Director Arne Glimcher (who made the lacklusterMambo Kings) coerces everyone with simplistic plot manipulations. Characters are given no depth, and the actors are pawns moved about like pieces on a Clue gameboard.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000B8GT92", "B00AEFYW64", "B002NZK5RI", "B002NZK5VO", "B000ENC5YW", "B002AT8K9W", "B0019BI1DM", "B000HT38IK", "0767810872", "B00096S49Y", "B00AEFXT1S", "6305428506", "0790732149", "B0045HCJ8K", "B00AEBB8LA", "6304711891", "B003ASLJIQ", "B002NZK5UU", "B0043X1FNQ", "0783226942", "B003AWRMC4", "B002NZK5R8", "B00AEFXYJA", "B00015YVDG", "B002AS464Q", "B00008L3S6", "6305310335", "B002AT8KA6", "B00AEFXX9Q", "0790730979", "0783240295", "0792159659", "B001UDS4BS", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B00AP2DC94", "B00AEBB9UK", "B00AEFXEGS", "B0000EYUCK", "B00AEFXIIW", "B00AEFYF2K", "B001NY4WYC", "6305213305", "B000P5FH3K", "B00005UQ9T", "B00AEBB8O2", "B00007K02J", "B00009L1TA", "B00011CZRE", "B001CQONHM", "B00005JH9M", "B003ASLJJU", "B00AEFYD9K", "B000G5SILC", "B00008K76U", "6305428115", "6304884400", "B000GFLKF8", "B004EPYZP8", "6305432317", "B0045HCJFS", "B002QW7AMG", "B000244GCW", "B00JPQ1INI", "B0045HCIZE", "B003L20IG0", "B005NKIPUY", "B007IUEEA2", "B001AR011A", "B003AWRM9M", "B0000VJG72", "B00441GZ1Y", "6304806434", "B000PMFRYW", "B0045HCJHQ", "0790736411", "B00005Y1UV", "B000QUCRB4", "B00AEFYENK", "B002AT8KAG", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B000U1ZV76", "B002VWNID6", "B00005JKTP", "B002GIBVVG", "0783226888", "B003AWRMBA", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B003A12WBQ", "6305133476", "B00003CXGV", "B0006GANOQ", "B00029RT9E", "B002AS466O", "B00008L3UQ", "630542828X", "B002GHHHN8", "6304806450", "B000R4SMCW", "0783229402"], "bought_together": ["B000B8GT92", "B000ENC5YW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000B8GT92", "B00005JM5B", "B000ENC5YW", "B00H9KKGTO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 177460}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.75, "brand": "CONNERY,SEAN", "asin": "0790740796", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XBEVCNY9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Just Cause (Snap Case)"}

Neo has always questioned his reality, but the truth is far beyond his imagination. Neo finds himself targeted by the police when he is contacted by Morpheus, a legendary computer hacker branded a terrorist by the government. Morpheus awakens Neo to the real world, a ravaged wasteland where most of humanity have been captured by a race of machines that live off of the humans' body heat and electrochemical energy and who imprison their minds within an artificial reality known as the Matrix. As a rebel against the machines, Neo must return to the Matrix and confront the agents: super-powerful computer programs devoted to snuffing out Neo and the entire human rebellion.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JLTM", "B0001DI5W6", "0784011923", "B001FB55HQ", "0792845684", "B001DZFYPW", "0790731975", "6300271331", "B00003CXE6", "0792839846", "0792133153", "6303257844", "6303313345", "6300182304", "6303168507", "B00000JGEK", "6304071876", "6300215830", "6301963725", "0800199421", "6303398480", "6305363668", "6303202004", "079213690X", "6304258984", "B0000509BZ", "6304434170", "630018627X", "6301976622", "0783222955", "6302610702", "6302787564", "0800132009", "0767825411", "6303020089", "6301574117", "6302909023", "B000003KHS"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLTM", "B0001DI5W6"], "also_viewed": ["B001DJLD1M", "B0054509I4", "B001CEE1YE", "B00005JKCH", "6303148352", "B000AYELVA", "B001GZ6QEC", "B001JNNDBA", "B0000AXE8I", "B0001DI5W6", "6303215734", "B00005JLTM", "B0007WFX62", "6304143184", "B00005N5S5", "B001AQT0Z4", "B001FB55HQ", "B0013FBS20", "B0001BKAEY", "B000PC6A3E", "B00007ELF1", "B00005JMQW", "B0000633U4", "1880521008", "B004XKVPG6", "B00ANGID14", "B001RIY4WE", "B008M4MB8K", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00B4804KS", "B00E5I2MCM", "B005LAIHY0", "B0013FSL3E", "B00471JSRE", "B0057R5XRG", "B00E9PMMX0", "B00C3MKCF6", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00AQNOCZ0", "B00IWULSTC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 579943}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.97, "brand": "", "asin": "0790745399", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51208Z0A3HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Matrix"}

{"description": "After the Oscar-winning The English Patient, writer/director Anthony Minghella attempted another tricky literary adaptation with The Talented Mr. Ripley, which features heartthrob Matt Damon cast against type as a psychopathic bisexual murderer. Tom Ripley (Damon) is a bright and charismatic sociopath who makes his way in mid-'50s New York City as a men's room attendant and sometimes pianist, though his real skill is in impersonating other people, forging handwriting, and running second-rate scams. After being mistaken for a Princeton student, Tom meets the shipping tycoon father of Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law), who has traveled to the coast of Italy, where he's living a carefree life with his father's money and his beautiful girlfriend, Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow). Dickie's father will pay Ripley 1,000 dollars plus his expenses if he can persuade Dickie to return to America. As Ripley and Dickie become friends, Tom finds himself both attracted to Dickie and envious of his life of pleasure. In time, he decides that he would rather be Dickie Greenleaf than Tom Ripley, so rather than go back to his life of poverty, Ripley impulsively murders Dickie and assumes his identity. The Talented Mr. Ripley was based on the first of a series of novels featuring Tom Ripley written by Patricia Highsmith; the story was previously filmed in 1960 as Purple Noon, with Alain Delon as Ripley.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000E33VWW", "B004SIP71M", "B0014GI6I2", "B00112S8RS", "B0013XZ2QK", "B008220DGE", "B002LVVCJY", "B00008WI9N", "B001P3SA8K", "B0060ZJ7DA", "B00018D40O", "B00AQBDU4Q", "B00003CWTI", "6305803765", "B0000BXMZ8", "B000PAAJZ6", "B00005BCK9", "B009D004TA", "B00008K7AO", "B00320J6WS", "B00000IC7G", "B002AT8KAG", "B00AEFXE9U", "B0006GW2JU", "B00GUO2SKA", "0393332144", "B00AQTY3JO", "6305781095", "B00005JMW7", "0783226845", "B00000G02H", "B00G7QPXUI", "B000M341SC", "B0060ZJ7BC", "B0009W5IMO", "B00H9KKGTO", "B000P5FH3K", "B00077BOFG", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B000HRMAPE", "B000BOH904", "B0036TGSR6", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00H9L26AA", "B004SIP7F8", "0788815490", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B004SUDQ22", "B0000VD02Y", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00562D3Y2", "B000A7DVR2", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B004SIP8W0", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00AMEZDK6", "B00005LIRC", "B000QGEB1M", "B000059XTI", "B004SIP6QI", "B000189LE2", "6305213305", "B0000640VK", "B000EQHXNW", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B001MSYH7Q", "B00D2CYU2W", "B000NIVJFY", "B00005JKN2", "B002ZG9800", "B00079Z9VO", "B00005R87R", "B000034CZA", "B00AEFYC96", "B008220DIC", "0792844807", "B004SIP73U", "B000MZHW40", "B0007UC8Y4", "B0016Q2D66", "6305065551", "B0045HCJ8K", "B00006RCNY", "B0010X8NF0", "B0001DCYUU", "6305781052", "B00005V5NU", "B0012OX7EO", "B000P0J0D8", "B00008G7UL", "6305428239", "0792846443", "B0045O2PHS", "6304696515", "B000F1IQN2", "B00GM7STPI", "B00AEFY8MM", "B00003CWRX"], "bought_together": ["B000E33VWW", "B004SIP71M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00JAQJMJ0", "0783225903", "B002ZG97RE", "B009D004TA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 52816}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.79, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "0792165020", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516X8NQJ30L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Talented Mr. Ripley"}
{"description": "When the theatrical release of James Cameron'sTitanicwas delayed from July to December of 1997, media pundits speculated that Cameron's $200&nbsp;million disaster epic would cause the director's downfall, signal the end of the blockbuster era, and sink Paramount Studios as quickly as the ill-fated luxury liner had sunk on that fateful night of April&nbsp;14, 1912. Some studio executives were confident, others horrified, but the clarity of hindsight turned Cameron into an Oscar-winning genius, a shrewd businessman, and one of the most successful directors in the history of motion pictures.Titanicwould surpass the $1&nbsp;billion mark in global box-office receipts (largely due to multiple viewings, the majority by teenage girls), win 11&nbsp;Academy Awards including best picture and director, produce the best-selling movie soundtrack of all time, and make a global superstar of Leonardo DiCaprio. A bona fide pop-cultural phenomenon, the film has all the ingredients of a blockbuster (romance, passion, luxury, grand scale, a snidely villain, and an epic, life-threatening crisis), but Cameron's alchemy of these ingredients proved more popular than anyone could have predicted. His stroke of genius was to combine absolute authenticity with a pair of fictional lovers whose tragic fate would draw viewers into the heart-wrenching reality of theTitanicdisaster. As starving artist Jack Dawson and soon-to-be-married socialite Rose DeWitt Bukater, DiCaprio and Kate Winslet won the hearts of viewers around the world, and their brief but never-forgotten love affair provides the humanity that Cameron needed to turnTitanicinto an emotional experience. Present-day framing scenes (featuring Gloria Stuart as the 101-year-old Rose) add additional resonance to the story, and although some viewers proved vehemently immune to Cameron's manipulations, few can deny the production's impressive achievements. Although some of the computer-generated visual effects look artificial, others--such as the sunset silhouette ofTitanicduring its first evening at sea, or the climactic splitting of the ship's sinking hull--are state-of-the-art marvels. In terms of sets and costumes alone, the film is never less than astounding. More than anything else, however, the film's overwhelming popularity speaks for itself.Titanicis an event film and a monument to Cameron's risk-taking audacity, blending the tragic irony of theTitanicdisaster with just enough narrative invention to give the historical event its fullest and most timeless dramatic impact.Titanicis an epic love story on par withGone with the Wind, and like that earlier box-office phenomenon, it's a film for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305123616", "6304117752", "6301792734", "6303215734", "B00000JS61", "6304178352", "6303396623", "6303314015", "B00003CXTF", "0769403468", "6301734734", "6302936381", "6303300480", "6305368139", "B00005RRG3", "6302610702", "0792839846", "6300207919", "B000P0J0C4", "6304546262", "B000056BRF", "6304400551", "6303101267", "630150528X", "6303637574", "B000P0J0EW", "6305126062", "6302935148", "0800199421", "6304681496", "0792116887", "6301963911", "B0000DCGT1", "B00001IVED", "6305169187", "B00006RCST", "6300216721", "630197879X", "0800113055", "076780922X", "080010367X", "0800141326", "0800184319", "6304039522", "B000066AXC"], "bought_together": ["6305123616"], "also_viewed": ["B009VQHDSQ", "6303314015", "B0074JODXU", "B00003CXTF", "B003JQZXWW", "6302787068", "6301796535", "0788812807", "0788806270", "B00005JKDQ", "6304500831", "6305229449", "6304117752", "6300213668", "6304089767", "B0000AQZYM", "079213690X", "6303049079", "6305123616", "6303402348", "6301792734", "0788812408", "B00079HZSE", "B000035Z2S", "B00000K3AN", "0788805843", "6302526574", "B0000029YC", "6303534422", "6303215734", "B0070285YE", "B00008LDO9", "0783216084", "6304434340", "B00BBND56G", "0788805533", "6300183211", "6302320402", "6305750750", "B0002CHI3S", "0790748266", "6304143184", "B0000040CM", "B005X7H9SQ", "B00004RFHF", "B00005V1Z7", "6302814782", "6301572688", "B00000JS61", "B008SLUWZG", "6303257844", "B00078XGO2", "0790736039", "B0000040EJ", "B000065U6Q", "B00003CX7L", "B00000ADKZ", "6300263673", "6302178924"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 65950}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.47, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "0792151712", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21BAWEVBJ1L.jpg", "title": "Titanic [VHS]"}
{"description": "Well, bless my beautiful hide! Director Stanley Donen invests this rollicking musical with a hearty exuberance. Howard Keel, with his big-as-all-outdoors baritone, stars as a bold \"mountain man\" living in the Oregon woods who brings home a bride (plucky songbird soprano Jane Powell) to his six slovenly brothers. Taming the rambunctious brood, Jane proceeds to make gentlemen of them so they can woo sweethearts of their own. But old habits die hard: their flirting gives way to fighting in the film's celebrated barn-raising scene, a lively acrobatic dance number exuberantly choreographed by Michael Kidd. Big brother chimes in with his own brand of advice--an old-fashioned kidnapping! Donen manages to get away with such a politically incorrect plot by investing the boys with a innocent sweetness, most notably the youngest brother played with genial earnestness by Rusty (Russ) Tamblyn (pre-West Side Story). This modest production became a huge hit and remains one of MGM's best-loved musical comedies, an energetic, high-kicking classic.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000F6D1", "630233683X", "6304178352", "6305282927", "6303444202", "6304151306", "B00004TZS4", "0790744759", "0792837533", "6303494390", "6302363268", "0792837614", "6304400551", "6304117752", "6300246787", "6301390725", "0792837630", "6303854311", "6300275310", "B00000I1EM", "6300269566", "B00004TRD5", "0792840844", "0792837649", "6301976932", "B0002B15Y2", "6300216195", "6304331851", "B0074JOUHE", "0792837096", "0790741091", "6301586026", "B0000040EO", "6300215717", "B000006GTO", "6304005490", "6300182118", "6302136261", "6300215598", "0800100832", "6302363292", "6303929966", "6300184889", "6302241103", "0783235593"], "bought_together": ["B00000F6D1", "630233683X"], "also_viewed": ["B001PO550A", "B00004TZS4", "B000HT3PGU", "6301976932", "B0007Z0O9U", "6303215734", "0783235593", "B0000040EO", "6304178352", "6305282927", "0792837614", "6304151306", "0792837533", "6300215695", "0792837630", "630233683X", "6303494390", "B00EQIYZTO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 331822}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0792837592", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G22RBC2ML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers [VHS]"}
{"description": "Jack Finney's classic science fiction novel has been the basis of three big-screen adaptations, beginning with the 1956 chillerInvasion of the Body Snatchersand most recently as 1994's underratedBody Snatchers. This acclaimed 1978 version from director Philip Kaufman (The Right Stuff) is every bit as creepy as the '56 original, and it fits perfectly into the cycle of paranoid thrillers that thrived in American movies of the 1970s. Kaufman stylishly directs from an intelligent screenplay by W.D. Richter, while Donald Sutherland and Brooke Adams lead a distinguished cast (including Jeff Goldblum, Leonard Nimoy, and Veronica Cartwright) and must fight for survival as the population of San Francisco is systematically cloned by alien &quot;pods&quot; from a distant, dying planet. The atmosphere of dread and paranoia grows increasingly intense as the complexity of the alien invasion is gradually revealed, until nobody can be trusted to be who they appear. Finely tuned performances enhance the film's eerie atmosphere, highlighted by moments that will lurk in your memory long after the movie's over. MGM's DVD release includes a full-length audio commentary by Kaufman, a &quot;pod culture&quot; retrospective,Body Snatcherstrivia, production notes, and the original theatrical trailer.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B007Y1NNAW", "B00005JPUN", "B0045HCJ8A", "B000AQKU72", "B0045HCJKS", "B00009NHC0", "B00AEBB8VK", "B00005JKFR", "B00518A70E", "B000063UR0", "B000FVQLKW", "B0013D8LAE", "B0045HCJSA", "B0087ZG7PW", "B00026L8US", "B00008438U", "B00000IQC4", "B000V4UFZK", "B0013LL2Z2", "B000EHQTZO", "B000VECAD0", "B000QGEB1W", "B001GCUO0W", "B006TTC5J0", "B000RXVNDI", "B0016I0AJG", "B00AEBB94G", "B00001TZ6Q", "B000P0J0BU", "B001D5C1OO", "B004L9GMBC", "B0045HCJJE", "B001BGS17Q", "B000FFJZO2", "B000O78KWE", "6304723113", "B000FOPPEC", "B00009NHBC", "0783225903", "B000E6ESEY", "B00006G8K0", "B00158K1EQ", "B00153ZR8G", "B000EHSVNW", "B002NZK5U0", "B00005LC4L", "B0006B2A42", "B00007JMD8", "0783240953", "B000HEWEDK", "B004LB5FAO", "B000063UR1"], "bought_together": ["B007Y1NNAW", "B000AQKU72"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007Y1NNAW", "B00005JKFR", "B0045HCJSA", "B00009NHC0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 106455}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.45, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "0792838416", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41y7q27x8nL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Invasion of the Body Snatchers"}
{"description": "This was the first James Bond adventure produced after the success ofStar Wars, so it jumped on the sci-fi bandwagon by combining the suave appeal of Agent 007 (once again played by Roger Moore) with enough high-tech hardware and special effects to make Luke Skywalker want to join Her Majesty's Secret Service. After the razzle-dazzle ofThe Spy Who Loved Me, this attempt to latch onto a trend proved to be a case of overkill, even though it brought back the steel-toothed villain Jaws (Richard Kiel) and scored a major hit at the box office. This time Bond is up against a criminal industrialist named Drax (Michel Lonsdale) who wants to control the world from his orbiting space station. In keeping with his well-groomed style, Bond thwarts this maniacal Neo-Hitler's scheme with the help of a beautiful, sleek-figured scientist (played by Lois Chiles with all the vitality of a department-store mannequin). There's a grand-scale climax involving space shuttles and ray guns, but despite the film's popular success, this is one Bond adventure that never quite gets off the launching pad. It's as if the caretakers of the James Bond franchise had forgotten that it's Bond--and not a barrage of gizmos and gadgets (including a land-worthy Venetian gondola)--that fuels the series' success. Despite Moore's passive performance (which Pauline Kael described as &quot;like an office manager who is turning into dead wood but hanging on to collect his pension&quot;),Moonrakerhad no problem attracting an appreciative audience, and there are even a few renegade Bond-philes who consider it one of their favorites.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000RPCK1K", "B000NIBUR6", "B000M53GLS", "B000RPCK24", "B000M53GN6", "B000RPCK1A", "B000RPCK0Q", "B000NDEXPM", "B000NIBUS0", "B001R10BN2", "B000M53GMW", "B000RPCK1U", "B000M53GNG", "B000NIBURQ", "B000M53GM2", "B000NDEXPC", "B00004RG62", "B001EDVNNU", "B000M53GMC", "B00004WEJZ", "B001PPLIEG", "B00AQSN7HE", "B007REV4T8", "B00005JL0I", "B009PN18R2", "B004BR7XLM", "B008YAPQX4", "B000067J15", "B00AZFECBS", "B00006BH8G", "B00AZFECJU", "B009RO9LKK", "B00AZFECL8", "B00000BLFI", "B009L6VWRO", "B000HT3PF6", "B009NUUBBQ", "B001AQT0WW", "B0000BYRO9", "B0001ENZLQ", "B009NUTPAO", "B009NUV0E8", "B0014C2FX8", "B009L6UDUG", "B00008K76U", "B005LAII44", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001U6YI9W", "B00AZFECS6", "B000O599YY", "B00AVWIQZS", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B007STBUHI", "B0045HCJ9O", "B004OB2EYQ", "B003Q6D2B4", "B00005PJ8S", "B004EPYZUS", "B008JFUO72", "1612185452", "B00005ATZT", "B00DZFKNFO", "B0000BYRO7", "B000BZISSU", "B00001U0BN", "B00AEFYENK", "B0014Z4ON4", "B001AQMBIC", "B0000UJL96", "B004L9GMBC", "B001PO6FF4", "B000FO0AA6", "B0000AUHOH", "B00009NHC0", "0792839064", "B000MGTQ7U", "B00005JLRQ", "B001AQO3WO", "0783226039", "B00AEBB8VK", "B00005JKU0", "B0013LL2Z2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000RPCK24", "B000M53GN6", "B001R10BN2", "B000NDEXPM"]}, "price": 11.94, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 283251}, "asin": "0792838033", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513267YK57L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Moonraker THX Edition"}

Thus, the James brothers are played by James and Stacy Keach; the Youngers by David, Keith, and Robert Carradine; the Millers by Randy and Dennis Quaid; and the Fords by Christopher and Nicholas Guest. Hill, working with an evocative Ry Cooder score, creates a film that is at once breathtakingly exciting and elegiac in its treatment of these post-Civil War outlaws. The Keaches in particular bring a surprising dignity to the roles of Frank and Jesse James, while David Carradine is a hoot as Cole Younger--and the Quaids mimic real life (as it was for them then) in their battles as the Miller brothers.

{"description": "Remember the outfit Cher wore to the Oscars when she won an Academy Award for her performance in this 1987 film? Ay-yi-yi. The actress' more retiring character in this infectious comedy leaps several psychological hurdles just giving her hair a permanent. But then the original screenplay by John Patrick Shanley (Joe Versus the Volcano) is a wonderful, gently satirical tale of an Italian-American family dealing with repression and dissatisfaction against a backdrop of cultural expectations. Cher is focused and funny as a widow who feels she should marry an older fellow (Danny Aiello), but then falls for his black-sheep brother (Nicolas Cage). Olympia Dukakis and Vincent Gardenia are perfect as her parents, and John Mahoney (of TV'sFrasier) has a memorable, small role as a middle-aged man on the make who gets a lecture from Dukakis's character. Shanley's dialogue is comically stylized in a way that makes one appreciate how much words can inform an actor's performance. Taking its cues from him and director Norman Jewison (And Justice for All), the cast immerse themselves in a pool of hilariously operatic emotion.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000542C7", "B000JU8H9C", "B00006FMUW", "B00009AOBI", "630560097X", "B0045HCJ76", "B00000DR7Y", "B00008G7UF", "B000ZM1MG4", "B00C6F61HS", "6305236569", "B000YDBPAM", "B001EJW0SG", "B00DSKSZXI", "B0001AVZA8", "B0000AOV4I", "6304765266", "B002ZG976U", "B001ECDVK4", "0767810856", "B00001W9G0", "B000023VTP", "B000MQC9H4", "0684809001", "0783240171", "B0007QJ1XE", "B000FO0AA6", "B007N31YH0", "6306012419", "B005S9EJ14", "B0000VD02Y", "B002VWNIAY", "B003ASLJK4", "6305213283", "B00DDT0JB0", "B0000DIXDR", "B00079Z9VO", "078322740X", "B00AEFXYOA", "0859654842", "B000BC8STM", "B00DW5ILUG", "B00026L7PE", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B00008977F", "B000021Y7Q", "0792844831", "B00000IQW5", "B00009V7PJ", "B00AEFY0F2", "6305133468", "B00005JG6N", "B0001Z3632", "B00004TJKK", "B00005JL3T", "0783229364", "B004SIP6BI", "B00015YVD6", "B002VWNIBI", "B000083E79", "B00004T0PP", "B000VBIGD6", "6305212112", "B007G8SEUM", "B00AEFY4CG", "B0000CDRW2", "B00008NRI7", "B000JYW5B4", "B00AEBB8OC", "6304712936", "B000E6ESI0", "B005ETAM4Q", "B003BV8ICC", "B00066FBQG", "B0001CNRBG", "B00143XE1E", "B000765IJK", "0790742071", "B003LMPKSQ"], "bought_together": ["B00006FMUW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00009AOBI", "B000JU8H9C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 39509}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.46, "brand": "CHER", "asin": "0792838963", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51A3795WX3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Moonstruck"}

{"description": "A collective vanity piece for the so-called Brat Pack of the 1980s, this coming-of-age movie--written and directed by Joel Schumacher (A Time to Kill)--is a largely unbelievable ensemble piece about college grads having trouble getting a lift-off into adulthood. As in John Hughes'sBreakfast Club--which has a lot of casting overlap with this film--each actor plays a rather narrow type with problems common to his or her classification. Some (as with Rob Lowe's seemingly doomstruck character) are more absurd than others. But absurdity isn't the issue in this movie; a general sense of indulgence is. Schumacher not only presumes an undeserved mystique about this cast, but he also exploits it and comes up empty.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["630018403X", "6301008960", "6300183467", "6300214370", "0783220804", "6300214710", "6305537798"], "bought_together": ["6301008960"], "also_viewed": ["6300183467", "6301412761"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 354955}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0800109481", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZND1F3RFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "St Elmo's Fire [VHS]"}
{"description": "Dustin Hoffman plays a lowlife who happens upon a plane crash and rescues the passengers, but doesn't really care about the value of his deed or the attendant publicity when the media starts searching for the hero. Another fellow (Andy Garcia) steps into the gap and claims credit, and as his life changes for the better he takes on a messianic glow. Geena Davis is the cynical television reporter who pushes the latter's fame in order to keep her story alive, and this film, directed by Stephen Frears (Prick Up Your Ears), takes a few familiar jabs at a manipulative and voyeuristic press. This is essentially an unofficial remake ofMeet John Doe, though it is less dramatic and forceful in the end than Frank Capra's classic. Chevy Chase has an oddly anachronistic part as Davis's editor (maybe he thought he really was inMeet John Doe), but the film belongs to Hoffman, who makes his character a slightly cleaned-up version of the actor's own Ratso Rizzo inMidnight Cowboy.--Tom Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 443525}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.7, "brand": "Hero", "asin": "0800121260", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51E50H7302L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hero [VHS]"}
{"description": "Bill Murray does warmth in his most consistently effective post-Stripescomedy, a romantic fantasy about a wacky weatherman forced to relive one strange day over and over again, until he gets it right. Snowed in during a road-trip expedition to watch the famous groundhog encounter his shadow, Murray falls into a time warp that is never explained but pays off so richly that it doesn't need to be. The elaborate loop-the-loop plot structure cooked up by screenwriter Danny Rubin is crystal-clear every step of the way, but it's Murray's world-class reactive timing that makes the jokes explode, and we end up looking forward to each new variation. He squeezes all the available juice out of every scene. Without forcing the issue, he makes us understand why this fly-away personality responds so intensely to the radiant sanity of the TV producer played by Andie MacDowell. The blissfully clueless Chris Elliott (Cabin Boy) is Murray's nudnik cameraman.--David Chute", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004RJ73", "B00287Z18Y", "6305609764", "B00005PJ6O", "B007P9HW3M", "0790740044", "B00AEFXXMI", "0783227388", "6305236569", "B00000IQBW", "B000E33W1W", "0804141444", "B0009RCPY8", "B0019HQICW", "B001AGXEAG", "B00AEFXDO6", "0767818105", "0792844890", "B002O3Z4YI", "B0000A14TA", "B0014Z4OMU", "B000K7VHTQ", "B00AEBBA2M", "B00005Y71F", "B00AEBB9SM", "B002GOAGZC", "B000G6BLW4", "B001IHJ988", "B00008G8LM", "B001LXIDVI", "B000QQLVPQ", "B005LL817W", "B001LMAK9W", "B00AEBB9DM", "0767806808", "B008R65XKQ", "B000G6BLWE", "B00003CXC3", "B00005O5CM", "B000065V3P", "B00005JM4Q", "B00AEBB9E6", "B000ELJAEM", "B00AEFYS2M", "B00AEFY0F2", "0767836324", "B002T51X4Q", "0800195175", "B0009X760U", "B000A3XYIM", "B000VBIGD6", "B000069HYF", "B00003CXR4", "0790742071", "B00AEFY3MC", "B000PHVZNE", "B0000YTP02", "B000E6ESI0", "B000YDBPAM", "B007Y1NR1W", "B00158K0QU", "B00006FMUW", "B00BLN4UPG", "B00AEFYM2S", "B000HT3PPG", "B000056HEA", "B000068NNU", "B0045HCJ7G", "B000V4UFZK", "B004GJYRA0", "B004AOECXI", "B000YAF4MA", "B00AEFXPG2", "B0045HCIY0"], "bought_together": ["B00004RJ73", "B00287Z18Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004RJ73", "B00005PJ6O", "B000E33W1W", "B00287Z18Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 107101}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.42, "brand": "", "asin": "080017948X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21XPDM6RK1L.jpg", "title": "Groundhog Day"}

{"description": "Regardless of whether it was \"too early\" in 2006 to dramatize the events of September 11th, 2001, \"World Trade Center\" succeeds as a tribute to the courage and sacrifice of those who served at \"ground zero\" in the wake of terrorist attacks on the WTC's twin towers in New York City. Removed from the politics of war and terrorism (yet still, like all films, inherently political in expressing its point of view), Oliver Stone's potent drama focuses on the nightmarish ordeal, and subsequent rescue, of Port Authority policemen John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and Will Jimeno (Michael Pe?a), who were buried deeply within the rubble of the WTC after the twin towers collapsed. Granted, it's only the film's historical context that distinguishes it from any other dramatic rescue story, but in focusing on the goodness of humanity in response to the evil of terrorists who remain unnamed and off-screen, Stone and first-time screenwriter Andrea Berloff create an emotional context as powerful as anything Stone has directed since \"Platoon\". Even as he resorts to some questionable tactics typically lacking in subtlety, Stone refrains from much of the blunt-force filmmaking that has made him a critical punching bag, rising to this challenging occasion with a heartfelt and deeply American portrait of unity ' personal, familial, and national. Flaws and all, \"World Trade Center\" serves an honorable purpose, reminding us all that for those fleeting days in September 2001, America showed its best face to a sympathetic world. --\"Jeff Shannon\"", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000GH3CR0", "B000EYJHDS", "B0006L0L5C", "0783223609", "B001F5274G", "B004X7UAMO", "B004WCSMDE", "B0000B1OBZ", "B008L0YN4U", "B005KBJC0I", "B00006B1HI", "B001MVWFAO", "B00AEBB8JM", "B00827OX5Q", "B00K2CHX9C", "B00K2CHW48", "B00006BS70", "B00003CXTG", "B00005JN5E", "B000065U1N", "B005VU9KW8", "B00006409F", "B000065Q9C", "B00AEBBA36", "B00AEFYENK", "B000KF0GWW", "B00063MCHA", "B004XFZ4JK", "B0013BM63O", "B00000G3PA", "B001MVYUR0", "B005DR64OQ", "B00005JK8K", "B00102F5WK", "B00005JM0O", "B0002V7ON8", "B004EPYZOO", "B007IUEEA2", "B000ELL1R6", "B000BBOUW2", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B000OVLBF8", "B000HRMAPE", "B003BV8ICM", "B000MGB6NM", "B001J710Z2", "B00005JMXX", "B001GCUO02", "B0015D20FE", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00005PJ8T", "B0077ATSSQ", "B001N44BVQ", "B008JFUNKU", "B00BUH1QHS", "B005F2JRUC", "B0002ZSKMS", "B004FQX59I", "B000GRUMRS", "B000FWHW7C", "B00AZNEW5G", "079284646X", "B00BTYMPX6", "B000059TG6", "B00012QLB4", "B00004Z4WR", "B000FUF6QI", "B007XF0W9O", "B00260HH2G", "B00008G8M4", "B000M4RG42", "B003ASLJQS", "B001SGEUYW", "B00GSBQ2HU", "B000JYW5DW", "0783225733", "B004A2AN5G", "B000BYA5G4", "B000A3XY5A", "B00001ZWUS", "B000EGDB10", "B0007KIFGE", "B000ZS8GWQ", "B00005JLRE", "6304711891", "6304806434", "B002NZK5VO", "B000P0J0C4", "B002O3Z50G", "B005LAIGYQ", "B002NXSRVG", "B00DZP1C2W", "B00005JNEI", "B00HEPE6MM", "B001HQZJMU", "B00HW3LAF2", "0800177967", "B000P0J09C", "B00AEFXGIY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000GH3CR0", "B0006L0L5C", "B000EYJHDS", "B001F5274G"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 748872}, "asin": "1415726698", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F3dNW-7-L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "World Trade Center"}

{"description": "This strange, 1985 experiment by Ridley Scott (Blade Runner) starred the up-and-coming Tom Cruise in a fairy-tale world of dwarfs and unicorns and demons. After the horn of a unicorn is broken, darkness and winter descend upon the world. Cruise's character, helped along by a magic sprite played by David Bennent (The Tin Drum), descends into hell to save paradise. This movie is almost a classic case of art direction gone amok. The somewhat amorphous Cruise doesn't lend much dramatic focus or artistic definition, but the drama between Tim Curry's satanic majesty and Mia Sara's character, who becomes a sort of princess of the netherworld, is pretty captivating. A mixed experience all around that makes one wish it had been more successful.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000JPH5", "6303212395", "B00000JPH4", "6300248100", "6303257674", "B00005OLY5", "6304509154", "079073463X", "0790700506", "630196649X", "6300214087", "0792845684", "6300182878", "0790705141", "6304994540", "6302182522", "0800135954"], "bought_together": ["B00000JPH5"], "also_viewed": ["B0000014XE", "B0000687KA", "B00IJUIY60"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 237584}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.99, "brand": "", "asin": "1558807381", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31HNRKDKT8L.gif", "title": "Legend [VHS]"}
{"description": "After making a critically acclaimed debut with the low-budget independent dramaHeavy, writer-director James Mangold took on this gritty crime drama, which was highly touted as Sylvester Stallone's long-awaited return to a serious dramatic role. With an illustrious cast of costars, includingGoodFellasalumni Robert De Niro, Harvey Keitel, and Ray Liotta, Stallone plays Freddy Heflin, the ineffectual sheriff of a New Jersey suburb that a group of corrupt New York cops have turned into their own off-duty criminal empire. Deaf in one ear and desperate to prove his worth, the sheriff takes on the cops with standoffish assistance from an Internal Affairs cop (De Niro), resulting in an explosive climactic showdown. The stellar cast can't be beat, and Stallone is quite good as the overweight cop whose pride is on the line. Mangold's script is wildly uneven, but the film still packs a white-knuckled punch.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000MEYKEG", "B0045HCJ5S", "B0045HCJG2", "B000056PNL", "B00315462E", "0783226934", "B0006IIPL2", "B00004STDN", "B000BMY2N8", "1558908846", "B0001FGBWK", "B0000VV5BM", "6304779631", "B00003CXTM", "B000U1ZV62", "6304602944", "B000R348QW", "B00DYXCHN8", "B00005JLO8", "6305310335", "B00004RE45", "B0045HCJGC", "B00H1RMWYW", "B0015XHP2C", "0767802578", "0767807588", "6305767866", "B00008YJDK", "B00D3LA6RK", "B002GHHHH4", "B004GJYRK0", "B00004XPPB", "B00ISAFELY", "B000B8GT92", "B00004U103", "6304711891", "B008220CQU", "B000M341QE", "B00562I40K", "B00008979E", "B00AEFXIIW", "B000P0J09M", "B0004Z33G4", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B000286RP2", "B0012QCZ5O", "B00AEBB95K", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B0006GAOGS", "6304806434", "B0004Z33EG", "B00AEFXW8I", "B004SIP95G", "B00008K76V", "B0000DI87S", "076780970X", "B000056PMU", "B006TTC5HC", "B0009UZG32", "0783226888", "B0004Z33EQ", "B000N4RAS8", "B001MZ5W3M", "B00J0IN6Z4", "B000P0J0AG", "B00AEFYW64", "B00008O38F", "B0002J58HO", "6304765258", "B000C20VPA", "B00AEBB9NM", "B0000AZT79", "B00AEFY9YY", "0783223609", "B002VWNICC", "B003ASLJKE", "B0045HCIXG", "B002ZG999U", "B00013RC8E", "B00008MTVY", "B003ASLJIQ", "B0001FGBW0", "B00JA3RVG4", "B00AEFYC96", "B003ELKNH2", "B00005N5QW", "B00000JGPE", "B00HEPC0TS", "B00BLF9FOK", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000E5KUJC", "B00005N89M", "B00596WEVI", "B0012RLX88", "B000A2UBN4", "B003AWRMBA", "B000QUCRB4", "0790732149", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000U1ZV4Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004U7MR14", "B002GHHHH4", "B0045HCJ5S", "B00004STDN"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 245936}, "asin": "1558908420", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519JSNHEA3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cop Land"}
{"description": "The surprising truth about Disney's 1982 computer-game fantasy is that it's still visually impressive (though technologically quaint by later high-definition standards) and a lot of fun. It's about a computer wizard named Flynn (Jeff Bridges) who is digitally broken down into a data stream by a villainous software pirate (David Warner) and reconstituted into the internal, 3-D graphical world of computers. It is there, in the blazingly colorful, geometrically intense landscapes of cyberspace, that Flynn joins forces with Tron (Bruce Boxleitner) to outmaneuver the Master Control program that holds them captive in the equivalent of a gigantic, infinitely challenging computer game. Disney's wizards used a variety of cinematic techniques and early-'80s state-of-the-art computer-generated graphics to accomplish their dynamic visual goals, and the result was a milestone in cyberentertainment, catering to technogeeks while providing a dazzling adventure for hackers and nonhackers alike. Appearing just in time to celebrate the nascent cyberpunk movement in science fiction,Tronreceived a decidedly mixed reaction when originally released, but has since become a high-tech favorite and a landmark in special effects, with a loyal following of fans. DVD is a perfect format for the movie's neon-glow color scheme, and the musical score by synthesizer pioneer Wendy Carlos is faithfully preserved on the digitally remastered soundtrack.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002ZG99QS", "B0001I55SS", "B004K4IZ3G", "B008R65XN8", "B0024FADAQ", "B0015NORDW", "B0037KMHRY", "B003TEI3E4", "B0013LL2Z2", "B0030MOTNE", "B008JFUS0U", "B008JFUO72", "B006ZOFX7K", "6305047456", "142313463X", "B0045HCJ9O", "B0039MIPDA", "0783226063", "B002GHHHOM", "B00008OE4W", "B0090SI56Y", "B0001I562I", "B000056WR3", "B0045HCJKS", "B0042YXWUK", "B004VT9JLM", "B003RACGZM", "B000P0J06K", "B005LAIH2W", "B002HWRYJE", "B002SR6CIM", "B0038OMQPW", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B0038ZITIE", "B006VRRGNK", "B00K7IPFSM", "B0001Z37HM", "B004M20YDU", "B004J1P5RE", "B00AEFXT7W", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000VECAD0", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00005PJ6N", "B0030MOXA8", "B00E5I2M9K", "B0002J58GU", "B001PPLIEG", "B001O4KBPA", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000QXDCJ2", "B0038OMQNY", "B00005PJ6M", "B004LWZW42", "6305428514", "B00005JKFR", "B008JFUO36", "B00005JKU0", "B008JFUQZ2", "630469654X", "B00005JKEX", "B005LAII3A", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00005AB62", "B000HEVZ9E", "B001AGXEAG", "B00JPS7HOA", "B001FB55HQ", "B004L9GMBC", "B002GHHHKQ", "B001MWUWU8", "B00006JC48", "B005COPWZW", "B000SUKPL6", "B00000JPH6", "B004LWZWFQ"], "bought_together": ["B002ZG99QS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002ZG99QS", "B004OBQQRW", "B0044XV3R8", "B00I6JOD2S"]}, "price": 14.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 226749}, "asin": "1558908358", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GQ2WSNH5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tron"}
{"description": "After slaying the Arthurian legend in their now classic Holy Grail, the Pythons set their sights on the Greatest Story Ever Told. Blind faith, virgin birth, crucifixion-nothing is sacred in this epic send-up of ancient times, which draws on the cornball biblical blockbusters of the 1950s to lampoon celebrity culture in any era.

{"description": "One of the most ferociously iconoclastic and experimental films of the French New Wave, Alain Resnais's 1961 feature, winner of the grand prize at that year's Venice Film Festival, is based on a script by Alain Robbe-Grillet. At its center is what seems to be a simple but unanswerable puzzle: Did its protagonist (Giorgio Albertazzi) have an affair the year before with a woman (Delphine Seyrig) he just met (or possibly re-met) at his hotel? The inquiry becomes an unsettling experiment in flattening the dimensions of past, present, and future so that any difference between them becomes meaningless, while Resnais's coldly formal but oddly dreamlike geometric compositions make space itself seem a function of subjective memory. Add to that Resnais's trademark tracking shots--long, smooth, a visual correlative of a wordless feeling--and this is a film that truly gets under the skin in almost inexplicable ways.

Cobra, the deadliest of foes and leader of an underground race of snake people, is proving to be a great threat to humankind. After spending many generations underground, he plans to take over the world again (with the help of his evil foes Pythona and Serpentor) by releasing deadly spores into the atmosphere. These spores can transform all life into the weakest of creatures, which means humans could potentially devolve into amoebas. However, in order to accomplish this, Cobra must acquire the Broadcast Energy Transmitter. (The BET activates the spores.) Luckily G.I. Joe is there to stop Cobra and his evil army. There are terrific fight scenes in which nobody gets hurt (like in all greatA-Teamepisodes) and the cartoon style is true to the G.I. Joe character. All your favorite G.I. Joe characters are here, including Falcon, Bazooka, Alpine, Duke, Snowjob, and Roadblock. Starring voices also help lend a hand: Don Johnson, Burgess Meredith, and Sergeant Slaughter.

The story is a fairly conventional one--two flyboys, both in love with the same girl, go off to fight World War I, and male bonding and heartbreak ensue. It's a perfectly serviceable plot, except for the key logical flaw that both young men have inexplicably fallen in love with the boring girl down the street and have somehow failed to notice that Clara Bow is the girl next door. Both male leads really flew their airplanes, and the dogfight footage is still spectacular. The main reason to watchWings, though, is to see the difference between an actor and a movie star. There are many actors in the film, but only two movie stars. Clara Bow is a treat to watch every minute she's on screen, and young Gary Cooper in a tiny role nearly walks away with the movie, mostly by standing there and looking dreamy. It's well worth sitting through a little cheesy organ music for a movie this much fun.--Ali Davis", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 148652}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Wings (1927) [VHS]", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BYA4HE", "B0002MHE1O", "B00005AUKB", "B000EHSVS2", "0790748339", "6301973364", "630261077X", "6301965760", "0800113055", "6301670140", "6301967410", "6302004500"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DJCPF85BL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "6300215482"}

{"description": "Bruce Lee kicked around Hollywood for years looking in vain for an American break when Hong Kong came calling. As Kato in the TV series The Green Hornet he had become an Asian star (the series was renamed for his character when it crossed the Pacific) and ripe for his own vehicle. This raw, low-budget effort, called The Big Boss in its native Hong Kong, is a generic revenge drama enlivened by Lee's intense screen presence and martial arts prowess. He's a country boy who takes a job at a Thailand ice-packing plant and discovers it's a cover for heroin smuggling. Lee is held back through the first half of the film by a promise he made his sweet, gray-haired mom not to brawl (which means you have to wait to see him in action), but his indignation turns to fury as friends and coworkers disappear and the boss sends thugs to take care of the brooding, intense country boy. The final half of the film is a series of violent confrontations, culminating in a marvelously choreographed showdown at the ice plant. Lean, mean Lee, with a physique that looked sculpted in bronze, became an overnight sensation with this film, breaking all Asian box-office records and starting an international kung fu craze, but none of the pretenders ever touched Lee's cool cinematic charisma or his martial arts grace. Lee returned the next year in The Chinese Connection. --Sean Axmaker", "related": {"bought_together": ["6300250164"], "also_viewed": ["B00005OSN6", "B0015RCUQO", "B00005B1X4", "6300250164"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 574610}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.7, "brand": "", "asin": "6300250156", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BYRDFFDSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fists of Fury [VHS]"}

{"description": "In England during World War II, three young kids are forced to evacuate their home and move in with the eccentric Eglantine Price (Angela Lansbury). At first the youths are unhappy--until they discover that Eglantine is studying to become a witch. Eglantine teaches the children magic, using her new powers to take them on fantastic, fun-filled adventures, all of which they experience on a flying bedframe. But when the neophyte witch decides to use her powers to help the Brits win the war, will she succeed...or will she just create more havoc?

{"description": "Starting aroundHalloween 4, that masked nut Michael Myers stopped chasing his sister (played by Jamie Lee Curtis in the first and second films, as well asHalloween H20) and went after his niece. Now he's chasing her around again in part 5, but it's a lot of other people who die in the process. Donald Pleasence continues his mad-doctor bit from the earlier movies, Danielle Harris is the unfortunate relation, and Donald L. Shanks plays the monster. The film is an improvement on parts 2 and 4 (part 3 having nothing to do with Michael Myers), but it still amounts to routine slaughter with none of John Carpenter's stylistic brilliance from the original movie.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["630130053X", "6304288433", "6304136242", "B00023NRSM", "6300214605", "630428845X", "6300214656", "6305171769", "6300214192", "6302814391", "6300214311", "6301094352", "6300218058", "B00008DDU9", "6300214087", "6302717450", "6303396585", "B00000JQTR", "6303566391", "B00008EYBD", "6303579388", "6301589025", "6304169558"], "bought_together": ["6304288433"], "also_viewed": ["630130053X", "B00023NRSM", "630428845X", "6304136242", "6304288433", "6305171769", "B00005LC4Q", "0780627032", "B000FA57UI", "B000RIWAVW", "6301589025", "6302720419", "B00008DDU9", "6300214087", "B0000VCZMU", "B00000JQTO", "B0000039A6", "6302975832"]}, "price": 14.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 66825}, "asin": "6301562925", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/413P9DA22VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Halloween 5 [VHS]"}
{"description": "Storytelling doesn't get much purer than this--a film with virtually no dialogue and not a minute that isn't fascinating, either for the plot it pursues or the way director Jean-Jacques Annaud gets his ursine stars to do what he wants. The story deals with a young cub who, after his mother is killed in a landslide, bonds to a lumbering male Kodiak. The two of them then must cope with an invasion of hunters into their territory--and Annaud makes it clear whose side he's on.

{"description": "Director Bob Clark's charming, touching, and very funny adaptation of humorist Jean Shepherd's nostalgic, autobiographical Yuletide novel,In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash, remains essential holiday family viewing. Narrated by a man (Shepherd) recalling his childhood, the film looks back at the compulsive efforts of 7-year-old Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) as he tries every means possible to acquire his dream Christmas gift--a Daisy-brand Red Ryder repeating BB carbine with a compass mounted in the stock. Problem is, he lives in a Norman Rockwell-esque Midwestern town in the 1940s, where his parents, teachers, and even Santa Claus all warn Ralphie that \"he'll shoot his eye out.\" Episodic in nature and seen entirely through the eyes of a child, the film offers a wonderful look at the day-to-day eccentricities that grew out of this conservative period. More interestingly, it cleverly captures childhood urgency, where even the most trivial fantasies or objects become immediate life-or-death necessities. While countless family Christmas movies serve up clich&eacute;d situations suffocating with preachy sermons, Clark's acute eye for detail and odd mixture of warmth, satire, and quirky humor are the reasons why so many viewers have rediscovered this after it initially bombed in the theaters. Sentimental without being syrupy, it's a true rarity: a holiday movie that adults and children can enjoy equally, for completely different reasons and regardless of the season.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["079070546X", "6301969707", "6303215734", "B00005LOUS", "6302091632", "B001E4TDR2", "B00000JS61", "5559477621", "6304209266", "B0002F6BQU", "6304117752", "6304400551", "6303442447", "6302526574", "6304089767", "6302794331", "6301390725", "6305123616", "0788812807", "6302765536", "6303314015", "B00005LL26", "0307142450", "6301404440", "6300215695", "6303122647", "B000YABV7W", "0793941520", "0783215517", "6302503795", "B00004UGAU", "B000003KLW", "0375810331", "B00004VVP8", "6301912810", "6301578805", "B00004RFHF", "6301300394", "6302090873", "B0000D14JV", "6300157601", "B00000JGEK", "B00008X5J8", "6301928458", "B00000JKNL", "6301627768", "0800139151", "B00001IVED", "B00001YX9H", "6304140738", "6301798503", "6303675212", "6300989003", "B00005A1VG", "6302581907", "0767825985", "6300216993", "6301670140", "6301977742"], "bought_together": ["079070546X"], "also_viewed": ["6301969707", "B00001IVED", "B00005LOUS", "6303215734", "B00006HBUC", "6304117752", "6302914469", "6304500831", "6303212379", "6304400225", "6300274268", "6302787068", "155890641X", "B00000JS61", "6302178924", "6304434340", "B00004VVP8", "6304089767", "6302642248", "B0007KTBIU", "B00005LL26", "0788812408", "6304400551", "B0000AQZYM", "6303314015", "6302961572", "B00005JKDQ", "6304718551", "B0002F6BQU", "0783231482", "0792839846", "B000028U3S", "B00006FDMY", "6303123244", "B00003CX7L", "6305123616", "B00003CX8I", "6302320402", "0790719029", "6300213668", "6304143184", "1560395966", "B00005O5ML", "6302503795", "B00000K4ZI", "0788805843", "0790742578", "6303212395", "1560395737", "6303338690", "6302091632", "6304290888", "0790700506", "0790742322", "B00000490M", "B00004TX1W", "6304539274", "B00004RFHF", "6304151306"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 318159}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6301966554", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512TVV2E0DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Christmas Story [VHS]"}

{"description": "Kevin Costner as a warped serial killer, a pillar of the community whose dark side is embodied by an on-screen William Hurt? You have to admit, it sounds intriguing, right?Mr. Brooksis the vehicle for this unsavory story, and it turns out to be a lot less kicky than it sounds. Mr. Brooks is a Portland, Oregon tycoon and philanthropist whose \"addiction\" to murder is suddenly re-surfacing--with plenty of help from his sneering alter ego, who generally sits in the back of the car, goading Mr. Brooks on. (The other characters can't see William Hurt in all this, of course.) The unbelievably convoluted plot has Mr. Brooks confronted by a blackmailer (comedian Dane Cook) who has a surprising twist on things, and trailed by a cop (Demi Moore) who comes equipped with her own set of professional and marital woes. As if that weren't enough, when Brooks's daughter (Danielle Panabaker) comes home, it becomes clear that some traits run in the family.The scenes with Costner and Hurt are the best stuff in the film, even if director Bruce Evans can't figure out how to play fair visualizing their presence to others. But the script, which among other whoppers make Demi Moore's character a millionaire, is just too unbelievable to stomach. If William Hurt's character provided a running commentary for this movie, there wouldn't be anything left after he got through mocking it.--Robert HortonThe Cast ofMr. BrooksKevin CostnerWilliam HurtDemi MooreDane CookMarg HelgenbergerDanielle PanabakerBeyondMr. BrooksMr. Brookson Blu-RayMr. Brooks: Music From The Motion PictureMore from MGMStills fromMr. Brooks", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767817729", "B0038RSJB4", "B003AWRM9M", "B000R4SMCW", "B002U4UYYQ", "B002NZK5Q4", "B000KF0GWW", "B001ILFUBE", "B00005JKZH", "B00B83ROIE", "0792844874", "B0068FZ0O2", "B002NZK5TQ", "B00JA3RVG4", "B0000TANUI", "B004EPYZP8", "078324021X", "B003UESJEM", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B003L20IG0", "B00005JNP4", "B002AT8KAG", "B00AEFXSLE", "B000FKO5QK", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEBB9NM", "B002GHHHHO", "B002QW7AMG", "B000WMA6R8", "0783233507", "B000OYC7BW", "B0007NFLO0", "B00005J760", "B00006AUJR", "B0006N2EZ0", "B00005Y1UV", "B000F5WR4W", "B0010YSD8Q", "B000GFLKF8", "B002NZK5RI", "B002DU39GW", "B0019EXZY4", "B003ASLJJU", "B002AF4Y9G", "B00HLSW6II", "B004FQX59I", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00005V9HH", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00005JMWP", "B004SIP8ZM", "B004A8ZX28", "B004AOECXI", "B000FFL2G6", "B002QEHPQU", "B00AEBB86A", "B00005JLZN", "B002VWNID6", "B003PIUIIS", "B009HIKAN8", "B000YENUI6", "B0009YA3OA", "B000E5N6LG", "B005NKIPUY", "B000RGN2JI", "B00005JN2Z", "B0006HBZXS", "B00005JLKN", "B004ULNJIU", "B0001FR3IQ", "B003U6SJY0", "B002CPMB9O", "B003Y5H5HO", "B00366BBTO", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B000P0J0EW", "B003ASLJQI", "B000E5KURY", "B00006RCNY", "B00005JPD0", "B002NZK5VO", "B000LP6KNU", "B00AEBB8LA", "6305313687", "B002AT8KD8", "B004BZ5AMI", "B007FQXEXW", "B000EMGICS", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEFXVOI", "B0006J28NC", "B000UGBOT0", "B008E70EES", "B00DU22OI6", "B002ZG99N6", "B000P0J0EM", "B005LAIGLE", "B0000JCFMW", "B002XMGGK6", "B00008CMRK"], "bought_together": ["B000R4SMCW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0767817729", "B00JA3RVG4", "0792844874", "B000KF0GWW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10765}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.83, "brand": "Mgm/Ua Studios", "asin": "6301971345", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WP046mMoL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mr. Brooks"}

{"description": "Thelma & Louiseis a feminist manifesto writ large on the big screen, a smart and funny gender reversal of the standard Hollywood buddy formula, a road movie extraordinaire, with characters who became instant cultural icons. No matter how you define it, Ridley Scott's 1991 box-office hit pinched a nerve and made the cover of national news magazines for tweaking gender politics like no movie before or since. Callie Khouri's screenplay overhauls the buddy formula with its story about two best friends (Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis) who embark on a liberating adventure that turns into an interstate police chase after a traumatic incident makes both women into fugitives; they are en route to a destiny they could never have imagined. The perfect casting of Sarandon and Davis makesThelma & Louisea movie for the ages, and Brad Pitt became an overnight star after his appearance as the con-artist cowboy who gives Davis a memorable (but costly) night in a roadside motel.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301796535", "6304938756", "B0000TANUI", "6300182304", "B000C20VRS", "6302642248", "B004IFIMT4", "6302526574", "6300269728", "0790749246", "6300182533", "B00003OSTO", "0790734060", "6300214044", "6300214222", "0790737566", "B00329TVQA", "B00004RFFA", "1556587864", "6304504012", "6300214753", "6300247236", "6302023742", "B00003CXTF", "6302130379"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 239563}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.96, "brand": "", "asin": "6302250269", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YYTDEG0QL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Thelma &amp; Louise [VHS]"}
{"description": "An unbelievable movie, and deliriously better for it. Keanu Reeves is a  hotshot law enforcement dude--Johnny Utah by name--investigating a series of  bank robberies in L.A. Four gunmen, disguised in rubber masks of ex-U.S.  presidents, have never come close to being caught, but veteran agent Gary Busey  has a theory: The bandits are surfers. This prompts the superb line, \"The ex-presidents rip off banks to finance the endless summer!\" This movie's full of  dialogue like that, but instead of sounding ridiculous it creates its own  infectious comic-book energy--ride the crest of it and you'll find the film's  giddy zone. Patrick Swayze plays Bodhi, zen-master leader of the surfing clan,  humming serenely with the wisdom of the waves. (Alarmingly, Swayze also did his  own skydiving stunts.) Director Kathryn Bigelow (Strange Days) stages the  action sequences with a visceral snap, and clearly has a gift for orchestrating  pulp fiction. Though not a huge hit when was first released,Point Breakhas a well-deserved cult reputation thanks to its video afterlife.

{"description": "The British superspy with a license to kill takes on his dark underworld double, a classy assassin who kills with golden bullets at $1 million a hit. Roger Moore, in his second outing as James Bond, meets Christopher Lee's Scaramanga, one of the most magnetic villains in the entire series, in this entertaining but rather wan entry in the 007 sweepstakes. Bond's globetrotting search takes him to Hong Kong, Bangkok, and finally China, where Scaramanga turns his island retreat into a twisted theme park for a deadly game of wits between the gunmen, moderated by Scaramanga's diminutive man Friday Nick Nack (Fantasy Island's Herv&eacute; Villechaize). Britt Ekland does her best as the most embarrassingly inept Bond girl in 007 history, a clumsy, dim agent named Mary Goodnight who looks fetching in a bikini, while Maud Adams is Scaramanga's tough but haunted lover and assistant (she returns to the series as the title character inOctopussy). Clifton James, the redneck sheriff fromLive and Let Die, makes an embarrassing and ill-advised appearance as a racist tourist who briefly teams up with 007 in what is otherwise the film's highlight, a high-energy chase through the crowded streets of Bangkok that climaxes with a breathtaking midair corkscrew jump. Bond and company are let down by a lazy script, but Moore balances the overplayed humor with a steely performance and Lee's charm and enthusiasm makes Scaramanga a cool, deadly, and thoroughly enchanting adversary.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302510023", "6302510031", "630251018X", "630251004X", "6302510007", "6302380596", "6304047843", "6302510198", "630238060X", "6302380294", "B0000068SI", "B00008V2VP", "6304032579", "6302380588", "B000006FNX", "B00004TYS8", "6303651461", "6303651488", "6305784906", "B00004RWUH", "6302824613", "6303212263", "630596260X"], "bought_together": ["6302510023", "6302510031"], "also_viewed": ["6302380588", "6302510031", "6302510007", "6302510023", "B00004TYS8", "6302380294", "6304047843", "630251018X", "630251004X", "6303651488", "630238060X", "6303651461", "6302380596", "6302510198", "B00008V2VP", "6304032579"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 170742}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.58, "brand": "", "asin": "6302510015", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510E8WWVDZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Man With the Golden Gun [VHS]"}

{"description": "Throughout his long, wandering, often distinguished career Francis Ford Coppola has made many films that are good and fine, many more that are flawed but undeniably interesting, and a handful of duds that are worth viewing if only because his personality is so flagrantly absent. Yet he is and always shall be known as the man who directed theGodfatherfilms, a series that has dominated and defined their creator in a way perhaps no other director can understand. Coppola has never been able to leave them alone, whether returning after 15 years to make a trilogy of the diptych, or re-editing the first two films into chronological order for a separate video release asThe Godfather Saga. The films are our very own Shakespearean cycle: they tell a tale of a vicious mobster and his extended personal and professional families (once the stuff of righteous moral comeuppance), and they dared to present themselves with an epic sweep and an unapologetically tragic tone. Murder, it turned out, was a serious business. The first film remains a towering achievement, brilliantly cast and conceived. The entry of Michael Corleone into the family business, the transition of power from his father, the ruthless dispatch of his enemies--all this is told with an assurance that is breathtaking to behold. And it turned out to be merely prologue; two years laterThe Godfather, Part IIbalanced Michael's ever-greater acquisition of power and influence during the fall of Cuba with the story of his father's own youthful rise from immigrant slums. The stakes were higher, the story's construction more elaborate, and the isolated despair at the end wholly earned. (Has there ever been a cinematic performance greater than Al Pacino's Michael, so smart and ambitious, marching through the years into what he knows is his own doom with eyes open and hungry?)The Godfather, Part IIIwas mostly written off as an attempted cash-in, but it is a wholly worthy conclusion, less slow than autumnally patient and almost merciless in the way it brings Michael's past sins crashing down around him even as he tries to redeem himself.--Bruce Reid", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302054982", "6304025831", "6301792734", "6305123616", "6302383455", "B000059HFB", "6300271617", "B0000DI87S", "6304233639", "0792151712", "B00005PJ6V", "6303029027", "6300183211", "B000C20VRS", "6301574117", "0792158261", "6300214826", "B0000A36J1", "0790731975", "0783222149", "6304994540", "630354231X", "6304508611", "B00011CZRE", "6301977742", "B00003CXOO", "B00005NOHP", "B00000K3AN", "6301963911", "B000059HGY", "B000005QWI", "B00005NKW1", "6301628454", "6302822688", "6304285116", "B00000K2SO", "B000054OW2", "6302909023", "6302305934", "B00000FZCU", "0792845684", "6304071876", "B00005ATQA", "6305169187", "630268644X", "B00004W9C7", "B00004CIOV", "0800116917", "B00000K2SC", "B000067IXQ"], "also_viewed": ["6302383455", "B0019L770A", "B000003KHS", "0792174909", "B00EN09FKO", "630021639X", "B000059HFB", "6304467567", "0792152808", "B00BBND56G", "B002J40X0C", "6301792734", "0800116917", "B00000J2KZ", "0793558107", "B0000DI87S", "B0019L21GA", "0792158261", "6305363668", "6300183211", "0684836475", "6304443064", "6302158176", "B000930DLO", "B00006AL1C", "0792151712", "B000028U3S", "B00AEBB9DM", "B0018U250O", "B00AQJ8MLY", "6305123616", "B006TTC5DQ", "B00000F3SE", "B007STBUIW", "B002M2Z3BA", "B00J2R3VZI", "B00ITAQ2MS", "B0071JADFU", "B001UCJVJI", "B000LPS4BG", "B001FB55H6", "B002VWNIAY", "B008Y1YK0I", "B005FDXT32", "B005LAIIJY", "B000K6TOK6", "B00E9PMMX0", "B00KCTG4PO", "B00H9KKKAY"]}, "price": 30.59, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 105101}, "asin": "6302610702", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41yBN5Ti01L._SX300_.jpg", "title": "The Godfather Collection [VHS]"}

It turned out to be one of Allen's most lacerating comedies, a story about the fragility of relationships and the foolishness of older men seeking to recapture their youth with younger women. It features strong performances by Judy Davis, Liam Neeson, and director Sydney Pollack, as a friend of Allen's who chucks his longtime wife for an aerobics instructor, thus planting seeds of marital dissolution in all of his friends' heads.Husbands and Wivesprovided an uncanny peek into Allen's image of himself and his personal life, despite all of his protestations to the contrary.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303011411", "6301971922", "6304039166", "6303430546", "B000NNOYH4"], "also_viewed": ["B00005AUJP", "B000BWMEIS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 425809}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.03, "brand": "", "asin": "6302697042", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31J3XDF7AHL.gif", "title": "Husbands &amp; Wives [VHS]"}

{"description": "Director Gillo Pontecorvo's 1966 movieThe Battle of Algiersconcerns the violent struggle in the late 1950s for Algerian independence from France, where the film was banned on its release for fear of creating civil disturbances. Certainly, the heady, insurrectionary mood of the film, enhanced by a relentlessly pulsating Ennio Morricone soundtrack, makes for an emotionally high temperature throughout. Decades later, the advent of the \"war against terror\" has only intensified the film's relevance.Shot in a gripping, quasi-documentary style,The Battle of Algiersuses a cast of untrained actors coupled with a stern voiceover. Initially, the film focuses on the conversion of young hoodlum Ali La Pointe (Brahim Haggiag) to F.L.N. (the Algerian Liberation Front). However, as a sequence of outrages and violent counter-terrorist measures ensue, it becomes clear that, as in Eisenstein'sOctober, it is the Revolution itself that is the true star of the film.Pontecorvo balances cinematic tension with grimly acute political insight. He also manages an evenhandedness in depicting the adversaries. He doesn't flinch from demonstrating the civilian consequences of the F.L.N.'s bombings, while Colonel Mathieu, the French office brought in to quell the nationalists, is played by Jean Martin as a determined, shrewd, and, in his own way, honorable man. However, the closing scenes of the movie--a welter of smoke, teeming street demonstrations, and the pealing white noise of ululations--leaves the viewer both intellectually and emotionally convinced of the rightfulness of the liberation struggle. This is surely among a handful of the finest movies ever made.--David Stubbs", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 371273}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6302737249", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/211ZN60665L.jpg", "title": "Battle of Algiers [VHS]"}

{"description": "Best known for light, entertaining musicals such asSingin' in the Rain, director Stanley Donen grew more adventurous (and less successful) in the latter stages of his career, but this edgy romantic comedy from 1967 has proven to be one of Donen's best, most enduring films. Jumping back in forth in time, the film chronicles the marital ups and downs of a stylish British couple (Albert Finney and Audrey Hepburn) as they travel on various vacations over the course of their 12-year marriage. The separate vignettes combine to form a collage of joys and pains as the young couple struggles to maintain their fading marital bliss. In this regard, the film is refreshingly sophisticated in its treatment of the difficulties of long-term commitment, and with Hepburn and Finney in the leads, great performances are drawn from the acerbic wit of Frederick Raphael's screenplay. Fashion mavens will also marvel at Hepburn's astonishing wardrobe of late-'60s fashion--she's a showcase for summer couture, looking fantastic in everything from candy-striped bellbottoms to hip sunglasses and outrageously stylish hats. Some of the melodrama clashes with forced comedy (such as tiresome running gags or a cartoonish portrayal of crass American tourists), but that doesn't stopTwo for the Roadfrom being timelessly appealing and truthful to the challenge of lasting love.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303631851", "6300215598", "6304457383", "6302636779", "6300251152", "6301967119", "6300215717", "6304178352", "6300215814", "6301586026", "6305282927", "6301647734", "6301969316"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 157950}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.3, "brand": "", "asin": "6302878527", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517MTS1S2VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Two for the Road [VHS]"}

{"description": "This early film by Ingmar Bergman, made before his international hitsSmiles of a Summer NightandThe Seventh Seal, was vilified by critics when it first came out (one referring to it as \"a piece of vomit\"), but with time has earned a reputation as one of the master filmmaker's first important works.Sawdust and Tinseltouches on many of Bergman's standard themes--vanishing love, godless existences, the redemptive power of theater--in its telling of a disillusioned circus owner (&Aring;ke Gr&ouml;nberg) and his young mistress (Harriet Andersson of  Bergman'sThrough a Glass Darkly) as they set up for yet another performance in a small town. Both contemplate leaving the circus and each other, as Gr&ouml;nberg pays a visit to his now-independent wife (an exceptional Annika Tretow), and Andersson allows herself to be seduced by a local actor (Hasse Ekman), only to find herself used and humiliated. One can see traces of the melancholySmiles of a Summer Nightin the romantic roundelays that start out bright and end up bitter--the constructs may be farcical at times, but the emotions are raw and heartfelt. And stylistically, from the first frame the film evokes strong similarities toThe Seventh Seal; in fact, this film marks the first collaboration of Bergman and his legendary cinematographer Sven Nykvist. Despite some awkward dialogue and a static pace,Sawdust and Tinselshows a young, assured Bergman finding his way to the themes and techniques that would define his later films. A must-see for Bergman aficionados.--Mark Englehart", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 475308}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6302919568", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MYEN492HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sawdust and Tinsel [VHS]"}

The movie opens with Wyatt Earp trying to put his violent past behind him, living happily in Tombstone with his brothers and the woman (Dana Delany) who puts his soul at ease. But a murderous gang called the Cowboys has burst on the scene, and Earp can't keep his gun belt off any longer.

Blue is the most somber of the three, a movie dominated by feelings of grief. As the film begins, a car accident claims the life of a well-known composer. His wife, played by Juliette Binoche (Oscar winner forThe English Patient), does not so much put the pieces of her life back together as start an entirely new existence. She moves to Paris, where she dissolves into a wordless life virtually without other people. Kieslowski attaches an almost subconscious significance to the color blue, but primarily he focuses on Binoche's luminous face, and the way her subtle shifts in emotion flicker and disappear. The picture may be more enigmatic than the follow-upsWhiteandRed, but Binoche's quiet, heartbreaking presence becomes spellbinding; her performance won the best actress prize at the Venice Film Festival in 1993.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303326838", "6303486762", "6302508754"], "bought_together": ["6303326838", "6303486762"], "also_viewed": ["B005HK13T0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 467897}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6303160344", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518273SKGYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blue [VHS]"}

{"description": "Edward D. Wood Jr. was an actor writer-director-producer, occasionally in drag, who combined meager bursts of talent with an undying optimism to create some of the most bizarrely memorable \"B\" movies to ever come out of Tinseltown. Though Wood died in obscurity as an alcoholic in 1978, his films have been considered cult classics for years. He is consistently voted the worst director who ever lived. You would think this an odd subject, but director Tim Burton harnesses the undying hopefulness that made Wood such a character. Shot in black and white, just like Wood's creations, this stylized, witty production captures the poetic absurdity of Wood's films and his unconventional life. Burton's recreation of Wood's wonderfully awfulPlan 9 from Outer Spacelooks much better than the original low-budget quickie. Burton tackled an extremely strange subject matter for a biopic, but Wood is presented as naive almost to the point of delusion, so the story works. The pace sags in the middle, as the weirdness starts to wear thin, but Depp proves himself an adroit actor, even while wearing angora and a blonde wig. Wood's unconventional repertoire company is faithfully reproduced, including an Academy Award-winning Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi. Landau is pathetic, droll, and charismatic as the elderly junkie who made his last screen appearances in Wood's films.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301763041", "0800187873"], "bought_together": ["6301763041"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 314635}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.87, "brand": "", "asin": "6303407188", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F97RJE9XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ed Wood [VHS]"}

{"description": "David Lean focused all his talent as an epic-maker on Boris Pasternak's sweeping novel about a doctor-poet in revolutionary Russia. The results may sometimes veer toward soap opera, especially with the screen frequently filled with adoring close-ups of Omar Sharif and Julie Christie, but Lean's gift for cramming the screen with spectacle is not to be denied. The streets of Moscow, the snowy steppes of Russia, the house in the country taken over by ice; these are re-created with Lean's unerring sense of grandness. The movie is so lush and so long that it becomes an irresistible wallow, even when logic suffers--likeGone with the Windbefore it andTitanicafter. Sharif, who achieved stardom in Lean's previous film,Lawrence of Arabia, mostly looks noble, but the supporting cast is spiky: Rod Steiger as a fat-cat monster, Tom Courtenay as a self-righteous revolutionary, and Klaus Kinski and Alec Guinness in smaller roles. Geraldine Chaplin, in her adult debut, plays the doctor's compliant wife. Robert Bolt's screenplay won one of the film's five Oscars&reg;, with another going to perhaps the most immediately recognizable element of the movie: Maurice Jarre's romantic music, with its hugely popular \"Lara's Theme\" weaving in and out of a swooning score.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["0800116917", "6305123616", "0800132009", "6300185095", "0792839846", "B0000048ZL", "B00000F6D1", "B0000048YM", "B000GG4Y32", "6302098424", "B0000068ZQ", "6304400551", "6303494390", "6303057225", "B00006ADD5", "6301965701", "0790743213", "6301797957", "6303854311", "B00000FZCU", "0792116887", "B00004RGUU", "6300215539", "6303562248", "6300268748", "6302360978", "6303029027", "6302415853", "6300216721", "630018224X", "6302909023", "6302842263", "6300268799", "B00005Q4GY", "6301964012", "B00004TYS8", "6300216195", "6303402348", "6300215814", "0800199421", "6300246965", "6304039522", "0783226152", "6301607929", "6302226899", "6304005989", "0783235593", "0790751089", "630442972X", "B000006N70", "6300216012", "0790752395", "6301969413", "0792841026", "6303686745", "630196733X", "6300216748", "6302424909", "0783221347", "6304214502", "B00000IO4G"], "bought_together": ["0800116917", "0800132009"], "also_viewed": ["B009L2EW98", "0792151712", "0800116917", "0790743159", "6304239149", "6301792769", "6304089767", "155890641X", "6301628454", "6301792734", "B00000K3AN"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 381443}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6303599109", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SZ5GR64CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Doctor Zhivago - 30th Anniversary Edition [VHS]"}

If that's not enough, Hunter's character then has to fly to Baltimore to join her fractious family for another difficult Thanksgiving. Robert Downey Jr. is terrifically charming as her prankish, gay brother, and Anne Bancroft and Charles Durning show plenty of comic resilience during the predictably interesting Thanksgiving dinner scene. The script by W.D. Richter (Brubaker) avoids the usual clich&eacute;s in family dramas--the deepest, darkest secret revealed here involves the painfully sweet revelation of a 40-year-old crush.

{"description": "As one of the most respected American independent filmmakers, John Sayles has created a body of work as distinguished in its diversity as for its consistent quality and inspiring originality. He's never been one to march to the commercial beat, but chooses instead to follow his creative impulse wherever it leads him.The Secret of Roan Inishled Sayles to the beautiful and moody West Coast of Ireland; it is a tale of a girl who discovers that her family has been touched by myth and magic throughout the years. Following the death of her mother, young Fiona (Jeni Courtney) is sent to live with her grandparents on the Irish coast across from Roan Inish, the island where her family once lived. She's told stories about theselkies--seals that can turn into humans--who have been connected with Fiona's family over the ages. At first she's not sure if the selkies are real or mythological, but she later realizes that they hold the key to reclaiming her family heritage.What's remarkable about this film (which Sayles adapted from Rosalie Fry's novelSecret of the Ron Mor Skerry) is that it's not told as a cute fantasy for children, but as a straightforward, unsentimental story of a young girl's family history. That gives the film--which was beautifully photographed by master cinematographer Haskell Wexler--an understated charm that is completely absorbing in its atmosphere and subtle tone. There's magic as well, to be sure--you could almost swear that the seals and seagulls in the film took direction from Sayles as well as any human actor!--Jeff Shannon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 72068}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.05, "brand": "", "asin": "6303820905", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512E2V6V1PL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Secret of Roan Inish [VHS]"}

{"description": "This haunting classic of the silent screen is familiar to every graduate of Film 101. Like Eisenstein'sBattleship Potemkin, Godard'sBreathless, and Welles'sCitizen Kane, Caligari helped define a cinematic school... and forever changed the way the world made movies. It's also great fun, even for modern audiences.The film begins with two men trading horror stories. One promises the other a terrifying true tale--the harrowing story of his fianc&eacute;e's narrow escape from death. Here's the story: an amoral asylum director wants to see if he can order somnambulist patient Cesare to commit murder. To this end, the nefarious doctor masquerades as a traveling showman and picks victims from the gawking carnival crowds. He sends his sleepwalker out to execute bloody deeds by night--crimes of which Cesare is barely aware. Soon, Cesare abducts the narrator's girl and is caught ... which is only the beginning of the surprises.Caligari's world became the textbook example of 1920s German Expressionist cinema--a cockeyed dreamscape, where black-clad actors feverishly chase each other across moody, barely-realistic sets. Think of films such asDark Cityor theNightmare Before ChristmasorSaturday Night Live's \"Sprockets\" sketches.

{"description": "The fantastic visions of Belgian filmmakers Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet find full fruition in this fairy tale for adults. Evoking utopias and dystopias fromBraziltoPeter Pan, Caro and Jeunet create a vivid but menacing fantasy city in a perpetually twilight world. In this rough port town lives circus strongman One (Ron Perlman), who wanders the alleys and waterfront dives looking for his baby brother, snatched from him by a mysterious gang preying upon the children of the town. Rising from the harbor is an enigmatic castle where lives the evil scientist Krank (Daniel Emilfork), who has lost the ability to dream and robs the nocturnal visions of the children he kidnaps, but receives only mad nightmares from the lonely cherubs. Other wild characters include the Fagin-like Octopus--Siamese twin sisters who control a small gang of runaways-turned-thieves--Krank's six cloned henchmen (all played by the memorable Dominique Pinon fromDelicatessen), and a giant brain floating in an aquarium (voiced by Jean-Louis Trintignant). Caro and Jeunet are kindred souls to Terry Gilliam (who is a vocal fan), creating imaginative flights of fancy built of equal parts delight and dread, which seem to be painted on the screen in rich, dreamy colors.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300184064"]}, "price": 69.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 572605}, "asin": "6304080859", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KSX9TYT3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The City of Lost Children [VHS]"}
{"description": "Of course, we all know now why Ellen DeGeneres can't find Mr. Right, though she was much less forthcoming when she made this limp comedy in 1996. At that point, while riding the middling success of her TV series, it probably seemed like a good career move to make this increasingly desperate film. She plays Martha, a TV producer in her 30s who is under pressure from both her parents and friends to find the right guy. Then, by accident, she stumbles across Whitman (Bill Pullman), who seems like the ultimate dreamboat: handsome, sensitive, and thoughtful. But his flaws become quickly apparent, and when she tries to break it off, he becomes a stalker. DeGeneres has some funny material early on, then must settle for reacting to Pullman's bizarre behavior. Pullman often is funnier than his costar but neither of them is particularly well served by the cobbled-together script and the generic direction of Nick Castle.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303354939"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 389668}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6304106025", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZWHEVC0VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mr Wrong [VHS]"}

{"description": "Anthony Mann was a poverty-row director with ambition when he transformed this story of undercover Treasury agents (based on a collection of true cases) into a moody, alienated drama about two lawmen living a shadowed life in the underworld where a blown cover means death. Square-jawed Dennis O'Keefe, a former leading man turned beefy B movie tough guy, and Alfred Ryder star as the titular T-men who take over a counterfeiting investigation when their predecessor is killed, posing as street thugs to infiltrate their way into the gang and living the dangerous life of the gangster to the hilt. The documentary-style realism, with its authoritative narrator, location shooting, and stock-shot interludes of shuffling papers and laboratory testing, is given a nightmarish dimension with stark sets lit in claustrophobic shadows, creating an abstract, eerie emptiness. Penned by John C.

Saddled with often awkward dialogue and hackneyed narration, this low-budget gem derives its power from the brutal violence (often offscreen but no less unsettling for it) and spare style, and the desperation in the hard faces of the unglamorous actors.

{"description": "Chungking Expresstells two stories loosely connected by a Hong Kong snack bar. In one story, a cop who's been recently dumped by his girlfriend becomes obsessed with the expiration dates on cans of pineapple; he's constantly distracted as he tries to track down a drug dealer in a blond wig (played by Brigitte Lin, best known fromSwordsman IIandThe Bride with White Hair). Meanwhile, another cop who's recently been dumped by his girlfriend (Tony Leung Chiu-Wai, from John Woo'sHard-BoiledandA Bullet in the Head) mopes around his apartment, talking to his sponge and other domestic objects. He catches the eye of a shop girl (Hong Kong pop star Faye Wang) who secretly breaks in and cleans his apartment. If you're beginning to suspect that neither of these stories has a conventional plot, you're correct. WhatChungking Expressdoes have is loads of energy and a gorgeous visual style that never gets in the way of engaging with the charming characters. The movie was shot on the fly by hip director Wong Kar-Wai (Happy Together,Ashes of Time), using only available lighting and found locations.

Introducing themes and character types that Scorsese would return to inTaxi Driver,GoodFellas,Casino, and other films, the loosely structured story is drawn directly from Scorsese's background in the Italian neighborhoods of New York, and it seethes with the raw vitality of a filmmaker who has found his creative groove. As the irresponsible and reckless Johnny Boy, De Niro offers striking contrast to Keitel's Charlie, who struggles to reconcile gang life with Catholic guilt.

It was a few decades before Huston was able to finally realize his dream movie--and with an unimprovable cast. Sean Connery and Michael Caine are, respectively, Daniel Dravot and Peachy Carnahan, a pair of lovably roguish British soldiers who set out to make their fortunes by conning the priests of remote Kafiristan into making them kings. It's a rollicking tale, an epic satire of imperialism, and the good-natured repartee shared by Caine and Connery is pure gold. In today's screen adventures, humor is usually imposed on the material by a writer or director trying to make some kind of cleverly self-aware comment (&quot;Hey, we know it's a movie!&quot;), but that sort of jokiness can create so much ironic distance that it pushes the audience right out of the picture.

{"description": "Walt Disney studios had previously adapted Sheila Burnford's classic animal-adventure novelThe Incredible Journeyin 1963, and the story proves just as durable in this popular 1993 version, in which the heroic trio of animals are given voices provided by Don Ameche, Michael J. Fox, and Sally Field. They don't actually speak (like the clever critters inBabe), but we hear their &quot;voices&quot; as the lost household pets--Shadow the golden retriever, Chance the bulldog, and Sassy the cat--survive a harrowing series of adventures as they struggle to find their way home.  Perfect entertainment for kids, this frequently clever movie offers an abundance of wildlife and beautiful location scenery, and the vocal performances by Ameche, Fox, and Field are surprisingly effective. A hit with parents and children alike, the film was followed by a sequel in 1996.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000633U3", "B00000JL8E", "B002GHHHNS", "0783219733", "B0000AK7AB", "B00007JMDX", "B000065V42", "B0068FYZ84", "B001JAVVBM", "B0000AOX0O", "B00AKGG6E8", "B00005LK94", "B00AEFXMMO", "B00008979O", "B00AEFXMSS", "B005RDRDLE", "B000B8QG2W", "B00009YXAW", "B00028HBES", "B000AJJNIG", "B008R65XKG", "B0087F7VSY", "B00002E229", "0792833759", "B0000VV4W2", "B000CR7RH0", "B000RMJ4F8", "B004GJYROG", "0783227965", "B00AFEX83C", "B00AEFXMGU", "B000B8QG4A", "B0000633U2", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B00H5NY7O0", "B000089771", "0792839749", "B002BIGCXS", "B0084IHVGG", "B000HWZ4QG", "0783219806", "B00005RRG7", "B000VBJEEG", "B000Y11B7G", "B000056H26", "B00005TSMN", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B0084IHVUC", "B00E9ZATKI", "0767836324", "B00005T7HZ", "B000YERP2S", "B001DPHDCY", "B001ILFUD2", "B008H6GHEM", "B002GIBVV6", "B0015RRNN4", "B005F96UJ6", "B000065V43", "B00008N6NQ", "B001KVZ6FW", "B000XKW2WG", "B001CTDH4Y", "B000068QPM", "0440413249", "B000XUOIQE", "B0001I562I", "B0001I563M", "B00CMDPTUY", "B00003CXB4", "B003TNS3HC", "B0009NZ2KG", "B001THIQFO", "B000P0J09W", "B003PIUIHE", "B0000VCZKM", "B0000640SC", "6305161887", "B0007KTBIU", "B005QODEEE", "B004HO6I4M", "B004ZBACOE", "B000031EGV", "B000TPTCP0", "B00AEFY8FO", "B000G75AZC", "B000050MN3", "B0055HK792", "B00003CXJ4", "B004OWQTZ0", "B000065V3A", "B00005RDST", "B0000844M8", "B000HT389E", "B00008L3T3", "6305320950", "B0000633U4", "B000FKP3XY", "B0000VV4WW"], "bought_together": ["B00000JL8E", "B000065V42"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000Y11B7G", "B00000JL8E", "B000065V42", "B008R65XKG"]}, "price": 9.66, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3513}, "asin": "6304711913", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61GN498S74L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey"}

The canine is befriended by a lonely boy and proceeds to become the star of the kid's junior high school basketball team. Demonstrating an abundance of on- and off-court agility, Buddy can dribble like a pro (no, not the wet kind of dribble), and he never misses a shot. Michael Jeter plays Buddy's original owner who returns to get his dog back (don't worry, he's an unworthy weasel), and director Charles Martin Smith brings a refreshing flair to the climactic basketball scenes.Air Budwas a modest hit for Disney, and the film's entertaining vitality gets a touch of poignancy from the fact that Lucky, the canine actor in the title role, died of cancer not long after the film was released.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002WN8INY", "B003F3NDVW", "B0019ESNG4", "B000HWZ4QG", "B000093FHC", "B001ILFUC8", "B000XUOIQE", "B006070RQ4", "B0000639HP", "B00267N3E0", "B004YHRZJE", "B00BM4Q4FI", "B00006SFL7", "B004GJYROG", "B008C3AW78", "B000Y11B7G", "B008R65XKG", "B000R7G6HM", "B004YHRZM6", "B0000633U2", "B003E4B0H6", "B001GZM46G", "B00005NQGL", "B0000633U3", "B000089773", "B0000CABC8", "B006070RT6", "1423169751", "6304711913", "B0009ZE9XU", "B000HT389E", "B004GJYRF0", "B001GC9VK6", "B0009NZ2XS", "B000HT38A8", "B0074FUSLA", "1558908404", "B000053GTB", "B001ER4CPM", "B000035Z59", "B002GHHHNS", "B000089771", "B00AKGG6E8", "B006070RVE", "B00007JMDX", "B000CQ98FU", "B000068QPU", "B00005JMFH", "B00DNF1RDI", "B00004R99F", "B005IMHI82", "B00BJLDJ2U", "B000P0J088", "B000EXDS48", "B0000DZTNB", "B000065V42", "B000H5TH2A", "B00028HBES", "B0007LLPXI", "B001ILFUCS", "B000059TCD", "0783219806", "1442412690", "1423169468", "B000BFH2C8", "B0000DZTN8", "6305320950", "B000FFJYB6", "B00006BSIS", "B00H5NY7O0", "0783219733", "B000068NNU", "B00I03D8ZS", "B003PIUIHE", "B00005JKVU", "B003E4B0GW", "B00KD5HFJG", "B00029LO0Y", "0783227965", "B0006J28MI", "B008C0C23I", "B0006IIPK8", "B00006AW63", "B000FOPPE2", "B00H5NY7NG", "B00267N3EA", "B000FKP3XY", "B0007Z0NYG", "B0001I55VA", "B0007US7C6", "B001CTDH4Y", "B000YERP2S", "B005GP7EYE", "B000B8QG4A", "B0030IIZ4M", "B008UYPDCS", "B00005TN8K", "B000EOMB9U", "B000085EF7", "B000089799"], "bought_together": ["B002WN8INY", "B003F3NDVW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002WN8INY", "B003F3NDVW", "B0019ESNG4", "B006070RQ4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 100614}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 39.94, "brand": "Team Marketing", "asin": "6304765215", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WY661EZBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Air Bud"}
{"description": "The idea of fusing teen sex-comedy and horror genres into a boffo box-office bonanza seems like classic braindead Hollywood-think... but somehow, beyond all reason, the makers of this film manage to pull it off. Much of the credit goes to director Fran Rubel Kuzui (Tokyo Pop) who chooses wisely to let the jokes and action rip by so quickly that viewers won't have time to realize there's practically nothing going on. Also excellent is Kristy Swanson as the bubble-headed cheerleader who learns from a Van Helsing-ish stranger (Donald Sutherland) that she's, like, the reincarnation of this pure female warrior and stuff, destined to rid the world--or at least the Valley--of vampires. No sooner is the Buffster being schooled in the ways of vampire butt-kicking (much to the consternation of meek pretty-boy beau Luke Perry) than the lead vampire (Rutger Hauer) and his leering cronies show up, and leading up the pack is none other than Pee-Wee Herman himself, Paul Reubens. Fans of this film's popular TV offspring will appreciate the fang-sharp humor but may be surprised to find little evidence of the spooky atmosphere that permeates the series, though there are some inspired moments, particularly the ridiculous death-by-ruler scene.", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00GM5LL28", "B00005221C"]}, "price": 8.08, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1044044}, "asin": "6304789580", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MTTSXHFAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Buffy the Vampire Slayer [VHS]"}

Though some may find the characters' self-satisfaction and upscale neuroses a shade cloying, they are more than matched by Alda's solid, often funny writing.

{"description": "After the tight plotting and quirky intensity ofFargo, this casually amusing follow-up from the prolifically inventive Coen (Ethan and Joel) brothers seems like a bit of a lark, and the result was a box-office disappointment. The good news is,The Big Lebowskiis every bit a Coen movie, and its lazy plot is part of its laidback charm. After all, how many movies can claim as their hero a pot-bellied, pot-smoking loser named Jeff \"The Dude\" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) who spends most of his time bowling and getting stoned? And where else could you find a hairnetted Latino bowler named Jesus (John Turturro) who sports dazzling purple footgear, or an erotic artist (Julianne Moore) whose creativity consists of covering her naked body in paint, flying through the air in a leather harness, and splatting herself against a giant canvas? Who else but the Coens would think of showing you a camera view from inside the holes of a bowling ball, or an elaborate Busby Berkely-styled musical dream sequence involving a Viking goddess and giant bowling pins? The plot--which finds Lebowski involved in a kidnapping scheme after he's mistaken for a rich guy with the same name--is almost beside the point. What counts here is a steady cascade of hilarious dialogue, great work from Coen regulars John Goodman and Steve Buscemi, and the kind of cinematic ingenuity that puts the Coens in a class all their own.

{"description": "David O. Selznick wantedGone with the Windto be somehow more than a movie, a film that would broaden the very idea of what a film could be and do and look like. In many respects he got what he worked so hard to achieve in this 1939 epic (and all-time box-office champ in terms of tickets sold), and in some respects he fell far short of the goal. While the first half of this Civil War drama is taut and suspenseful and nostalgic, the second is ramshackle and arbitrary. But there's no question that the film is an enormous achievement in terms of its every resource--art direction, color, sound, cinematography--being pushed to new limits for the greater glory of telling an American story as fully as possible. Vivien Leigh is still magnificently narcissistic, Olivia de Havilland angelic and lovely, Leslie Howard reckless and aristocratic. As for Clark Gable: we're talking one of the most vital, masculine performances ever committed to film.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304117752", "0792839846", "6304178352", "630150528X", "6303215734", "B00000JS61", "0792151712", "0783222955", "0800116917", "6304151306", "630233683X", "6300183513", "0783221347", "6303494390", "B0000040EJ", "6302150620", "6300215814", "6301586026", "B00000F6D1", "6304274742", "6300215741", "0783235593", "B000056BRF", "6300215830", "6304400551", "6304239149", "6300185095", "6305282927", "0788806270", "6300207919", "6300213668", "6300181340", "6302610702", "5559477621", "6303854311", "B000059HH1", "6304039530", "0800100832", "B00004TYS8", "B00000JKNP", "B0000040EO", "6302936381", "6302227127", "6300215695", "6304039506", "6304994540", "6300277089", "6305576173", "630428635X", "6303020089", "B00005RRG3", "6301975987", "0783235607", "6301628454", "6300270971", "6303637574", "6300215628", "6304359705", "6304119046", "0792837207", "1558807780", "6300181987", "0783236352", "630251018X", "6302413435", "6303057225", "6301650514", "6304457316", "6300215512", "6301976061", "0800124693", "B000M7BEPQ", "B000005PPB", "630197350X", "6301976924", "0792837576", "B003UPPO2G", "6300267857", "B00005A1VG", "6301976983", "0790733897", "B00004RV8M", "6303651488", "6301969294", "6302241189", "6300246868", "B00000I1EM", "B0001E7LQG", "B00000F3QZ", "6303364772", "6303562248", "6304196954", "B00000FZCU", "6302640504", "6302360978", "0790733935", "6300181421", "6302484405", "6305718792"], "bought_together": ["6304117752", "6304178352"], "also_viewed": ["1451635621", "6304117752", "0792839846", "6304178352", "0800116917", "0792151712", "6304274742", "6304151306", "6303215734", "630233683X", "6304119046", "B00000JS61", "155890641X", "6305363668", "6304539258", "630018403X", "B002YZFBXA", "6302526574", "6300215598", "6300213668", "6301976983", "B0046ZE3LC", "6300215830", "0790743213", "6300182207", "6300181529", "B00000JGEI", "1558807780", "0792839129", "6304500831", "6304429274", "0784011923", "630150528X", "6304400225", "B00001IVED", "6300215717", "0788812408", "B00B7K0JZS", "0767825411", "B0000040EK", "B0000040EO", "0792158261", "B00008EYA5", "630141277X", "0800124693", "6302054982", "6303506291", "0783222955", "6300183211", "6300215814", "0790742322", "B00000JKNP", "B0000AM6IY", "B0000AQZYM", "0783216084", "6303402070", "6301797906", "630281622X", "6302961572"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 168297}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6305123616", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZGXJP009L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gone With the Wind [VHS]"}
{"description": "There was a time beforeLawrence of ArabiaandDoctor Zhivagowhen David Lean made smaller, more effortlessly picturesque movies, and this splendid Venetian travelogue and love story is one of them--the last, actually, before the epic onslaught started with the Oscar-winningThe Bridge on the River Kwaiin 1957. \"Sometimes I think a schedule in Venice is just, well, all wrong,\" observes a bewitched tourist to Katharine Hepburn's vacationing spinster near the beginning ofSummertime, which is based on Arthur Laurents's playThe Time of the Cuckoo. Before the end, however, Jane will have thrown her idealized romantic notions into the canals and embarked on a passionate affair with a married art dealer (Rossano Brazzi). More blissful than Lean's adulterous fableBrief Encounter10 years prior, but not entirely guilt- or pain-free, this deceptively simple romance is an often-fascinating glimpse at a time when sexual revolution for Americans--and especially middle-aged women--was confined to fanciful European trysts. Plus, with all the architecture, art, Italian conversation, music, and fine cuisine around you (all richly photographed on location by Jack Hildyard), who's to pish-posh a furtive all-nighter between one repressive country and a free-loving one? The two leads are graceful and even musical in their movements and line deliveries. Hepburn's initial outrage at the idea that illicit love is part of her impossibly beautiful surroundings may at first seem outdated, but the Academy Award-winning actress is too good not to suggest as well the poignant, deep fear her character has of opening up emotionally to anybody. Ultimately,Summertimeis the movie equivalent of a deep, satisfying sigh.--Robert Abele", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002B15Y2", "B005SYZZ9E", "B001QYOY3S", "B00AMEZDK6", "B003VA3JTK", "B00AJCUL0I", "B004K4FUT8", "B0035ECHIG", "B001HSNTKW", "B000ION7AI", "0788815490", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B00AEFXD1O", "B000085OY1", "B004SIP7D0", "B006H37P2K", "B004IK30KA", "B0001DCYUU", "B00004TWZH", "B000056HEA", "B004A8ZWSS", "B000069I0A", "B0042ZEEI8", "B00JX3SHIC", "B004CIIXDC", "B000JU8HBA", "B00871C09S", "B000G6L0EI", "B00KMULA9I", "B00007L4MV", "B004K4FUMK", "B00K6I8QZ2", "B000NJXG68", "B0002T2Q6U", "B008FYZIEQ", "B002XDR5P0", "B00003Q433", "630560097X", "B008SAPCAM", "B00005JKF6", "B0008ENIKM", "B00005Y6XU", "B00IO8UO74", "B00005AUK7", "B00KE3B6NI", "B000KGGJ1I", "B0009S4IH4", "B000I0RNV6", "B001GUYAZY", "B00007CVS4", "B000055XM8", "B002TSAAME", "B009NUHP24", "B00AEBB8SS", "B00005BH23", "B00005JH9B", "B000EDWKXI", "B000244ENS", "B00JPUUSEE", "B00J2TE3DU", "B000MGBLHS", "B001BSBBDK", "B005CFBZX4", "B00000F17A", "B001KXZGNW", "B006TTC5WC", "B0012GVMIA", "B00005JKGO", "B001LMU1A0", "B00005JKGX", "B00AEBB97S", "B001LMU19G", "B005SYZYYA", "B000068QJP", "B00K8CQ1Q2", "B005DI9906", "B003VA3JW2", "B00049QQJQ", "B00J2TCHP6", "B001D8W7EK", "B001PO54V0", "B000QJMDH8", "B001LPWGGY", "B00011D1OU", "B00005ALMH", "B00003CX8N", "B000056KMW", "B0007M222A", "B0006FO8M0", "B001HSNTGQ", "B004K4FUK2", "B0087ZG7R0", "B00005BCK0", "B000B8384Q", "B002IC1ETY", "B00JK32362", "B00008ZZ9J", "B00000IOKV", "B00KGLS050", "B007N5YK10"], "bought_together": ["B0002B15Y2", "B00AMEZDK6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002B15Y2", "B00AMEZDK6", "B004K4FUT8", "630560097X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 49302}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 20.34, "brand": "", "asin": "6305094934", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZCCAFM71L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Summertime (The Criterion Collection)"}

{"description": "If you were to argue that Mel Brooks'sYoung Frankensteinranks among the top-ten funniest movies of all time, nobody could reasonably dispute the claim. Spoofing classic horror in the way that Brooks's previous filmBlazing Saddlessent up classic Westerns, the movie is both a loving tribute and a raucous, irreverent parody of Universal's classic horror filmsFrankenstein(1931) andBride of Frankenstein(1935). Filming in glorious black and white, Brooks re-created theFrankensteinlaboratory using the same equipment from the originalFrankenstein(courtesy of designer Kenneth Strickfaden), and this loving attention to physical and stylistic detail creates a solid foundation for nonstop comedy. The story, of course, involves Frederick Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) and his effort to resume experiments in re-animation pioneered by his late father. (He's got some help, since dad left behind a book titledHow I Did It.) Assisting him is the hapless hunchback Igor (Marty Feldman) and the buxom but none-too-bright maiden Inga (Teri Garr), and when Frankenstein succeeds in creating his monster (Peter Boyle), the stage is set for an outrageous revision of the Frankenstein legend. With comedy highlights too numerous to mention, Brooks guides his brilliant cast (also including Cloris Leachman, Madeline Kahn, Kenneth Mars, and Gene Hackman in a classic cameo role) through scene after scene of inspired hilarity. Indeed,Young Frankensteinis a charmed film, nothing less than a comedy classic, representing the finest work from everyone involved. Not one joke has lost its payoff, and none of the countless gags have lost their zany appeal. From a career that includes some of the best comedies ever made, this is the film for which Mel Brooks will be most fondly remembered. Befitting a classic, the Special Edition DVD includes audio commentary by Mel Brooks, a \"making of\" documentary, interviews with the cast, hilarious bloopers and outtakes, and the original theatrical trailers. No video library should be without a copy ofYoung Frankenstein.

Yet, the more she satisfies him, the more he finds himself enslaved by her manipulation and control. As Capa gets closer to identifying the killer of his patient, Rose becomes an equally tantalizing mystery that he must solve -- if he can stay alive long enough to avoid a lunatic murderer who is stalking him.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003P9GN72", "B000VLCRCW", "B000EQ5SRK", "B00AEFYD2M", "B002AS463W", "0767807588", "076782170X", "B00005JMIJ", "B00008L3S6", "B00005JKI5", "B00006L92K", "B008XAT1LS", "B000TXPXAU", "B00006L91I", "B000E5N684", "B00008972P", "B000PMFS2I", "B0010SAGHS", "B00E8G5HXM", "B00023P4I8", "B00005V4XV", "6305308837", "B00000J11D", "B003XKNGNW", "B004SEUJEG", "B000HC2LHG", "B000RO9Q7W", "B0000ZMGWK", "B000193318", "B00GRZPRB4", "B000HT38EO", "1573623857", "B0043X1FNQ", "B0001GF2D8", "B006M3M5FM", "B0002KPIQY", "6305132917", "B000CBG5PG", "B00GPPXNIK", "B00008CMRK", "B0007W6HVM", "B00005K3NU", "B000BBOUUE", "B000EZ9084", "0783230559", "B00005LPZW", "B000H5TH1Q", "B0002T7YQW", "B00CPTUO1Y", "B00K0MM4AM", "B0019K4YT8", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B002AS466O", "B004GBMVTW", "B0043X1FKY", "B00004Y87P", "B0045HCIYA", "B0043X1FLI", "B0001NBLZ4", "B00005QJIG", "B0004Z32NI", "B00K31RBYY", "B000BX0VT6", "6304698747", "B0052ADPAU", "0783226888", "B000BGH29K", "B0020LH8WU", "B000BRP4BM", "B0009JMKIW", "B000GI3KGC", "B00004STDC", "6304779631", "B00ET2ODTE", "B001AZKB8K", "B0052ADPCI", "B000PKG8TM", "B009M4KTUG", "B0000633R7", "B000PMFRZ6", "0767817761", "B00HQLZC18", "B000068QPV", "B00APUAKYG", "B000PAAJZ6", "B0043X1FKO", "B0000TWNDI", "6305065551", "B00BTYOYGW", "B000008MOF", "B00A7WHL08", "B00BTYRB58", "0790730979", "B000069HZO", "B005ZVIPG0", "B000VTHYAE", "B0000D0YXV"], "bought_together": ["B003P9GN72"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008XAT1LS", "076782170X", "B002AS463W", "B000VLCRCW"]}, "price": 9.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17330}, "asin": "6305428484", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XZ8TR23SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Color of Night (Director's Cut)"}

{"description": "Generally acknowledged as a bona fide classic, this Francis Ford Coppola film is one of those rare experiences that feels perfectly right from beginning to end--almost as if everyone involved had been born to participate in it. Based on Mario Puzo's bestselling novel about a Mafia dynasty, Coppola'sGodfatherextracted and enhanced the most universal themes of immigrant experience in America: the plotting-out of hopes and dreams for one's successors, the raising of children to carry on the good work, etc. In the midst of generational strife during the Vietnam years, the film somehow struck a chord with a nation fascinated by the metamorphosis of a rebellious son (Al Pacino) into the keeper of his father's dream. Marlon Brando played against Puzo's own conception of patriarch Vito Corleone, and time has certainly proven the actor correct. The rest of the cast, particularly James Caan, John Cazale, and Robert Duvall as the rest of Vito's male brood--all coping with how to take the mantle of responsibility from their father--is seamless and wonderful.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["630021639X", "6302158176", "6300183211", "6304214502", "6300214826", "0790705141", "6303168507", "0790733927", "B00003CXE6", "630470786X", "6300267997", "0790741512", "6303471501", "6300271331", "6302054982", "6303686796", "B00005PJ8I", "B00004COR2", "0792842111", "6304258984", "6304509146", "0783216084", "6300215644", "6300216500", "B000062XM6", "0800199421", "B0002F6BQU", "0800116917", "630336568X", "6304508611", "B00000F13T", "6304935811", "6305363668", "B000005PFL", "6300182878", "0792116887", "6300182452", "B00005B238", "0792845684", "6300247171", "0792839846", "6302482712", "6302989787", "0790732017", "0800100832", "630442972X", "6304196954", "B000065U6Q", "6301208773", "B00000K2SC", "6302842263", "6304429274", "6303313345", "B0000A36J1", "B000059XY5", "079212569X"], "bought_together": ["630021639X", "6302158176"], "also_viewed": ["6302610702", "630021639X", "6301792734", "6303402348", "6300215830", "6304117752", "6300183211", "6302158176", "B00COYZF5A", "6300214060", "B000NTPDSW", "6305095566", "0792151712", "6305169187", "6303953425", "080010367X", "6302054982", "6301208773", "B000KX0ISG", "630310696X", "6302415853", "6304214502", "B00005B238", "6303168507", "B00E9PMMX0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 270877}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.98, "brand": "", "asin": "B000003KHS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/11KQ3QC757L.jpg", "title": "The Godfather [VHS]"}

{"description": "When the Muppets come to Broadway to find a producer for their musical, disappointment is the only result. Discouraged, the gang leaves New York and goes its separate ways while Kermit, his dream still alive, continues the search for a producer. With the help of a pack of rats who cook at a diner, Kermit signs up an enthusiastic producer and calls his friends back to New York. But when Kermit disappears before the musical opens, the rest of the Muppets must decide whether the show must go on. Songs about working for one's dreams and the importance of friendship send upbeat messages to kids, while parents will appreciate the good-humored jabs at the showbiz industry and the cameo appearances by Liza Minnelli, Joan Rivers, and Ed Koch, among many others.", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302642493", "6302642485", "B00000JYLP", "6304089627", "6302794331", "6303232221", "B00003ETPU", "6304416415", "6304089767", "6303124542", "0788812408", "B00006AULB", "6301390725", "6303929478", "6301991311", "B00000ICHA", "B00003CX7L", "6304401736", "B00000JS61", "6303534422", "6303929486", "B00003CWPW", "6302642248", "6303122647", "155890641X", "080013558X", "6302320402", "6304139640", "6302787068", "B000035Z46", "B00005JKDQ", "0767815963", "B00000J2JA", "B000M343BC", "6305229449", "0788802194", "B00005JKX3", "6304811233", "B000AY74OQ", "B00000JPG9", "B00005K9OA", "6302973791", "B00003L9AD", "B00004T2SI", "6302864836", "0767821327", "B00016JF2W", "6302481805", "0767831144", "B0000AM6I0", "6304015127", "1571320377", "6303018343", "0767814207", "0788812440", "0767831187", "B00005M2FI", "6304293968", "0780619765", "B0002YLCHE", "B00000I1XF", "6302794382", "6302798744", "B00000JQ8C", "1571322299", "1573305715", "B00008QSAJ", "B00003CXJ3", "B00003CXHR", "6300276813", "6304427603", "B00080ZGCO", "B000028U3S", "6304279485", "6302276268", "6302794250", "B00078XGO2", "0788812181", "6302886457", "B00004RFB0", "B00007JMEI", "1573305677", "6303403328", "0800196767", "6302458900", "B00004UGAU", "1573305774", "B000056IE9", "1573305707", "B00006490J", "1573305723", "6303036961", "B00006HB08", "B0000028KH", "630279434X", "B00000G3LH", "6301390636", "B0001IN09E", "1558907718"], "bought_together": ["6302642493", "6302642485"], "also_viewed": ["6302642493", "B00006AULB", "6302642485", "B004EPZ03O", "6304089627", "6302794331", "6303929478", "0788802194", "6305363668"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 275553}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.99, "brand": "", "asin": "B00000IQBQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PFEDHJSYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Muppets Take Manhattan [VHS]"}
{"description": "EDITOR'S NOTE: According to a Warner Home Video technician involved in  the production ofThe Stanley Kubrick Collection, Kubrick authorized all aspects of theCollection, from the use of Digital Component Video (or \"D-1\") masters originally approved in 1989, to the use of minimalist screen menus, chapter stops, and (in the case of2001: A Space OdysseyandThe Shiningon DVD) supplementary materials. Full-screen presentation ofThe ShiningandFull Metal Jacketwas also approved by Kubrick, who recomposed his original framing,  reportedly believing that those films looked best on video in the full-screen format. (In fact, the original theatrical aspect ratio ofThe Shiningwas 1.66:1, meaning that a relatively small portion of the image is lost.) Kubrick also chose mono over stereo,  believing that inconsistencies in theatrical sound systems resulted in loss of control over theatrical presentation.

{"description": "When Steven Spielberg was an adolescent, his first home movie was a backyard war film. When he toured Europe withDuelin his 20s, he saw old men crumble in front of headstones at Omaha Beach. That image became the opening scene ofSaving Private Ryan, his film of a mission following the D-day invasion that many have called the most realistic--and maybe the best--war film ever. With 1998 production standards, Spielberg has been able to create a stunning, unparalleled view of war as hell. We are at Omaha Beach as troops are slaughtered by Germans yet overcome the almost insurmountable odds.A stalwart Tom Hanks plays Captain Miller, a soldier's soldier, who takes a small band of troops behind enemy lines to retrieve a private whose three brothers have recently been killed in action. It's a public relations move for the Army, but it has historical precedent dating back to the Civil War. Some critics of the film have labeled the central characters stereotypes. If that is so, this movie gives stereotypes a good name: Tom Sizemore as the deft sergeant, Edward Burns as the hotheaded Private Reiben, Barry Pepper as the religious sniper, Adam Goldberg as the lone Jew, Vin Diesel as the oversize Private Caparzo, Giovanni Ribisi as the soulful medic, and Jeremy Davies, who as a meek corporal gives the film its most memorable performance.The movie is as heavy and realistic as Spielberg's Oscar-winningSchindler's List, but it's more kinetic. Spielberg and his ace technicians (the film won five Oscars: editing (Michael Kahn), cinematography (Janusz Kaminski), sound, sound effects, and directing) deliver battle sequences that wash over the eyes and hit the gut. The violence is extreme but never gratuitous. The final battle, a dizzying display of gusto, empathy, and chaos, leads to a profound repose.Saving Private Ryantouches us deeper thanSchindlerbecause it succinctly links the past with how we should feel today. It's the film Spielberg was destined to make.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006C7G9", "6303168507", "6303057225", "B00AEBBA36", "6302529441", "0800125762", "6304935811", "B00003CXTF", "B000EHSVS2", "0790734060", "6303257844", "6302415853", "B0007TKNGA", "6301247345", "6301662954", "0790734079", "6302610702", "6302909023", "630407185X", "0783221347", "079213690X", "0800132009", "0790701251", "6305363668", "6301115430", "0790752395", "6304071876", "6300268748"], "bought_together": ["B00006C7G9"], "also_viewed": ["0792151712", "6301792734", "0792837614", "B00003CXXO", "6303109950", "6304117752", "6303402348", "6303168507", "B00003CXTF", "B000RC7QVC", "0783221347", "078323662X", "630018627X", "6304151306", "0783230095", "6304233639", "B0000040EJ", "6303187064"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 269908}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.5, "brand": "", "asin": "B00000K3AM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4143F912CXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Saving Private Ryan [VHS]"}

{"description": "Syd (Radha Mitchell) is an editor at a painfully pretentious art  magazine; by chance, she becomes acquainted with lesbian photographer Lucy (Ally Sheedy) and her weirdo German girlfriend (Patricia Clarkson, in a strange Dietrich-like role).  Syd becomes captivated with Lucy and her work and, smelling a career move, offers to feature her in the next issue of the magazine.  The two become attracted, but their relationship is fraught with perils--Syd loses her rather square boyfriend, Lucy's girlfriend takes a hike, the avaricious management at the magazine pressures Syd, and, most importantly, the pair begins to travel down the road of heroin addiction.  Besides the lesbian theme,High Artaddresses such subtexts as what an artist will (or won't) be willing to do for recognition, and what price that recognition carries.High Artis a remarkably honest work, painful at times but understated and thoughtful.  It does an excellent job of portraying the heroin-induced torpor of Lucy and her bohemian friends as they lie around and become consumed with the stuff.  It's a cautionary tale, a sincere love story, a reflection on the nature of art, and a \"lesbian film\" for which the lesbianism is integral but not part of an overriding agenda.  Sheedy is excellent, as is Mitchell in a very expressive role.  It's far from being a feel-good movie, butHigh Artundeniably has some power behind it that will stick with you past the closing credits.--Jerry Renshaw", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00AFDN5Y0", "B008XAGN46", "B00006RJ97", "B00002CGGH", "B002SF9YTS", "B000SUKPL6", "B000A4T804", "B0001HAGSI", "B00FKPJ3VM", "B004BJMEO6", "B000F7CEBG", "B00827OWO8", "B0085E44W8", "B000J4QWIG", "B00011Y1QC", "B004AYMY92", "B00004U104", "B0038M61IC", "B00005QW5T", "B00004YKR3", "B005Q4CLKW", "B004EI2NM2", "B000F3UA6Q", "B001YXXRZ2", "B001E2PQGG", "B00BDTSLEO", "B0039S3872", "B003OYPOUA", "B0009Q0EMY", "B004AHAEV4", "B000062Y1E", "B00H3RT7M0", "B00005BKZK", "B00GPPXNIK", "B000OVLC0W", "B004N21KIC", "B00004STHG", "B000063K0D", "B00CBG9SQS", "B00005NRNS", "B003L20ICE", "B00EMAGCHE", "B008R6U69Y", "B00006CXI7", "B00C1LIZEE", "B00005OLBC", "B00003CYJ4", "B003YYVSEG", "B0002XNT12", "B00INUK5WM", "0780625528", "B000OY9V8Y", "6302703816", "B001MVWMIY", "B00125WAWI", "B007W6XXAE", "B0000C504K", "B003PCHSVO", "B000HT3P4M", "B0002KPIQY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AFDN5Y0", "B00827OWO8", "B008XAGN46", "B00006RJ97"]}, "price": 19.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 627413}, "asin": "B00002JWZT", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/7187XWM9M4L._SY300_.gif", "title": "High Art"}
{"description": "A confident hybrid ofM*A*S*H,Treasure of the Sierra Madre, andDr. Strangelove,Three Kingsis one of the most seriously funny war movies ever made. Improving the premise ofKelly's Heroeswith scathing intelligence, it explores the odd connection between war and consumerism in the age of Humvees and cellular phones. Writer-director David O.&nbsp;Russell's third film (afterSpanking the MonkeyandFlirting with Disaster), it's a no-holds-barred portrait of personal conscience in the volatile arena of politics, played out by one of the most gifted filmmakers to emerge in the 1990s.George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, and Spike Jonze (director ofBeing John Malkovich) play a quartet of U.S.&nbsp;soldiers who, disillusioned by Operation Desert Storm, decide to steal $23&nbsp;million in gold hijacked from Kuwait by Saddam Hussein's army. Getting the bullion out of an Iraqi stronghold is easy; keeping it is a potentially lethal proposition. By the end of their mercenary mission, the Americans can no longer ignore wartime atrocities (and neither can we--the film is boldly unflinching), and conscience demands their aid to Kuwaiti rebels abandoned by President George Bush's fickle wartime policy. This is serious stuff indeed, but Russell infusesThree Kingswith a keen sense of the absurd, and the entire film is an exercise in breathtaking visual ingenuity. Despite a conventional ending that's mildly disappointing for such a brashly original film,Three Kingsconveys the brutal madness of war while making you laugh out loud at the insanity.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00DON8NJ0", "B000IYV1ME", "B000O7667K", "B000H1RFKU", "B003ASLJOK", "B000JU7KAE", "B001G8XOMG", "B00DON4TPC", "B001O7JHSO", "B0046BHC6O", "B0021L8URQ", "B001XURJCS", "B001CT877G", "B0013FSXT6", "B002ZG97QU", "B0047BXR1W", "B001HN69CC", "B000JLPMPI", "B000HLDFK4", "B000TGGJKU", "B003L7DK60", "B001AQT0RC", "B001J6NZGU", "B0011VIODW", "B000Q7ZND6", "B000P6XU60", "B000H1RFKK", "B001FB55M6", "B0017TYPIG", "B000O176IO", "B0011E5D2Y", "B000KF0NI4", "B000Q6GX90", "B000LPS4BG", "B000M5AJQI", "B000JUB7LW", "B0015GDVTU", "B000UJ48UO", "B002Z7FM68", "B000I5XOWI", "B000MEYFXW", "B0012YYZYK", "B000PC0U1W", "B003YOZNBK", "B001NCDCQ8", "B000JLSLZQ", "B000R3PDK2", "B001FB55H6", "B0010HOZXA", "B003B1X80Y", "B000JLSM00", "B001O7JHW0", "B006H3MIYA", "B000MQ54OY", "B003UESJHY", "B000Q66J1M", "B006OQ0K0E", "B003TT2X6S", "B001OQCUZW", "B003TT2X6I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B006H3MIYA", "B002T9H2L0", "B003KGBIS4", "B00HF98SY4"]}, "price": 8.5, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1098395}, "asin": "B00003CX73", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BA5ATJSYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Three Kings"}

{"description": "Tammy Faye Bakker, she of the layers of makeup that made her face into a living Halloween mask, will forever remain a camp icon of '80s culture for many of us. Directors Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato aren't above needling Bakker for her more excessive accouterments, butThe Eyes of Tammy Fayeis ultimately a loving, sympathetic portrait of \"the first lady of televangelism.\" The film charts her life from traveling evangelist to the mother of three religious cable networks, and her fall from grace when husband Jim Bakker was forced out of the PTL (Praise the Lord) ministry after a scandalous affair. Always entertaining (sock puppets introduce each section) and at times surprising (did you know that Jim and Tammy were the first television ministers to reach out to the gay community and people with AIDS?), it rarely strays from Tammy Faye's version of events. Jerry Falwell becomes the story's sole scapegoat, but even the film's best arguments don't quite make Jim Bakker an innocent victim. But then it's not his film, it's Tammy Faye's, and Bailey and Barbato seem to have fallen in love with their charismatic subject. If nothing else, they reveal the woman behind the cultural joke and celebrate a spiritual survival story. RuPaul Charles narrates, and clips from the 1990 TV movieFall from Gracefeature a young Kevin Spacey as the adulterous preacher.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["0679445153", "B00HZ67OOW", "B007C95S9K", "B00005KHJX", "1585422428", "B00AAIDNL0", "B00C5SE8F8", "B000IY02W4", "B001WAKFP2", "0062516981", "B0068U5Z10", "B0056G1APC", "B004AR4W4O", "0785274251", "B007W2MKFM", "B007GMKX5W", "0871132931", "0783225482", "B00EPH8SBM", "B006QVRVW2", "B000ABKHZC", "B000GIXLX4", "B00028G7LG", "B00433KF1E", "B000UX6TK2", "B008B4LRMC", "0812693701", "B003H9K11Y"], "bought_together": ["B00005KHJX"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007C95S9K", "0679445153", "0062516981", "B000O76ZP8"]}, "price": 6.68, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 236071}, "asin": "B00003CXL4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X5VPX45YL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Eyes of Tammy Faye"}

{"description": "Employing shock techniques and sound design in a relentless sensory assault,Requiem for a Dreamis about nothing less than the systematic destruction of hope. Based on the novel by Hubert Selby Jr., and adapted by Selby and director Darren Aronofsky, this is undoubtedly one of the most effective films ever made about the experience of drug addiction (both euphoric and nightmarish), and few would deny that Aronofsky, in following his breakthrough filmPi, has pushed the medium to a disturbing extreme, thrusting conventional narrative into a panic zone of traumatized psyches and bodies pushed to the furthest boundaries of chemical tolerance. It's too easy to call this a cautionary tale; it's a guided tour through hell, with Aronofsky as our bold and ruthless host.The film focuses on a quartet of doomed souls, but it's Ellen Burstyn--in a raw and bravely triumphant performance--who most desperately embodies the downward spiral of drug abuse. As lonely widow Sara Goldfarb, she invests all of her dreams in an absurd self-help TV game show, jolting her bloodstream with diet pills and coffee while her son Harry (Jared Leto) shoots heroin with his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and slumming girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly). They're careening toward madness at varying speeds, and Aronofsky tracks this gloomy process by endlessly repeating the imagery of their deadly routines. Tormented by her dietary regime, Sara even imagines a carnivorous refrigerator in one of the film's most memorable scenes. And yet... does any of this have a point? Is Aronofsky telling us anything that any sane person doesn't already know?Requiem for a Dreamis a noteworthy film, but watching it twice would qualify as masochistic behavior.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JM23", "6305594333", "B0007CEXYK", "B00005YUPD", "078401213X", "1560252480", "B00H3JHGBC", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005JMJG", "B000I0QL7I", "B0009A40ES", "B00049QQHI", "B00005ATQB", "B000LAZDPG", "B00003CXZ4", "0792838068", "B0000AC8LR", "0783229526", "6305692572", "B0041KKYEM", "B000QGEB1M", "B00008977H", "B001AR60GK", "B000MGB6NM", "B0045HCJ08", "6305313687", "B001TOD92C", "B00009Y3QI", "B000NO39FG", "B000JBXXYK", "B00008975Z", "6305162026", "B00004UEDQ", "B000068MC2", "B00606OZUY", "B00003CWQR", "B000ERVK4Y", "B000A7DVR2", "B000A9QK6E", "B00EUENWIY", "B0016MJ6T2", "B00005JPAR", "B00008MTXI", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEFXESQ", "B000JMK6LW", "B00004Y6Q5", "B000FVQLQQ", "B000BYA5G4", "B00005JKJA", "B00005JKM2", "B0029LHW68", "B000BBOUUE", "B004FQX5B6", "B000PAAJZ6", "B000N3SU92", "B003YKYX9M", "B00AEBB8O2", "B00007AJF8", "B00A2H9QN8", "B0009WFEDC", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00013RC2K", "B000A7Q2DM", "B00003CXWV", "0792845803", "B001URA5Y8", "B00195I3O0", "B00006AFUR", "B000063JDE", "B00BMKGZVA", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00112S8RS", "B00177YA6U", "0767837398", "B000O76ZQC", "B0052ADP6Y", "B000J10F8C", "B000E6ESU8", "B00009OOFH", "B00005JLRE", "B0059GVBHG", "0767824954", "B00005JLWN", "B00E8G5GU6", "B000QXDCLA", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00004ZETA", "B00AEBB9CS", "B000021Y77", "B00011CZRE", "B002VECM4A", "B00003CXKS", "B006KH6CF4", "B000K7VHQE", "6305127654", "B00AFEXRME", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00020HB32"], "bought_together": ["B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JM23"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JMJG", "B000MEYKD2", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JPAR"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 222264}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.36, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXP1", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519CB9K0QML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut"}

The first disc has no extras but is packed with four separate Dolby Digital 5.1 tracks and is THX certified. The second disc holds four features, including a standard making-of featurette (15 minutes long) and a nifty segment that allows viewers to compare the storyboards to the final film and separate the music and sound effects in the train station sequence. More satisfying is the 20-minute short on the state of comic books, featuring revealing comments from critics and authors including Frank Miller (of the touchstoneDark Knightseries). Seven deleted scenes are introduced by the director, and while none is significant to the plot, they are all must-see for fans of the film.

{"description": "When it was released in 1999,The Omega Codesurprised Hollywood  by scoring $2.4&nbsp;million in its opening weekend, following a promotional blitz on the Trinity Broadcasting Network. The Christian televangelical outlet, which funded this chaotic biblical thriller, had built widespread awareness among its viewership, and the film attracted an appreciative Christian audience. While it's true thatThe Omega Codeoffers a wealth of biblical prophecy that Christians will study for years, it remains a pedestrian, headache-inducing movie that's too busy \"decoding\" the Bible to make any dramatic sense. With a cast that could populate an Aaron Spelling miniseries, it's too badly written to inspire serious religious discussion, and not terrible enough to qualify as entertaining schlock. It's just painfully, pretentiously bad.Rife with snippets from the book of Revelation, the convoluted plot finds a famous motivational speaker and \"Bible Code\" expert (Casper Van Dien) under the influence of an ultra-wealthy philanthropist (played by ultra-hammy Michael York) who schemes to crack the Bible's secret codes and take over the world. He's a vessel for the Antichrist (with snidely Michael Ironside as his henchman), and by the time Van Dien gets a clue from a pair of resurrected prophets,The Omega Codehas jettisoned any pretense of religious importance. Rather than dare a meaningful examination of faith and the power of evil, the movie opts instead for cheesy pyrotechnics, hackneyed action, and enough bad acting to make Arnold Schwarzenegger'sEnd of Dayslook like a masterpiece. Do you want to feel closer to God? Just read your Bible, forget about the code, and avoid this gawd-awful movie.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005UW81", "B00102F5YS", "B00006IUGH", "B00720OO0S", "B00175GAHE", "B008B49F4Y", "B0038N9X22", "B000051S4T", "B002UNXS68", "B002H6NVOC", "B000051S4V", "076620748X", "B00BBE962W", "B000XY6RA0", "B008ZRKIQ6", "B000059MPN", "B0002XNT1C", "B002TVQ4C6", "B00005Y6XK", "B00I099JO6", "B001EAWMB0", "B00005UF7J", "B007VJ5D14", "B000RZIH6W", "B00D6I7HH2", "0967680689", "B00D6I7DEE", "B0015NQEQU", "B0083TUE7E", "B003UCA4XI", "B006MWA96K", "B000OAV03C", "0967680654", "B0002V7OI8", "B000ARXG0Y", "B00097E6NQ", "B00006JDTN", "B007Q0JJIQ", "B001AYJ2Y0", "1570754233", "B0074JOUHE", "B004RUEXVQ", "B0000AOX0B", "0783225547", "B00006IUFW", "B000068IES", "080063442X", "B00BF657ZQ", "B001GH3CL0", "080106211X", "B000063JZP", "B0006J28K0", "B00004XPPG", "B000STC178", "B000E97HXK", "B000VECADK", "B000056WRR", "B00005JOC9", "B000AM6OQ2", "0971734704", "B003NKU9AK", "B000KLQUS0", "5559921017", "B00AEBB91O", "B0006Z2LJC", "1563713942", "B00174RCHW", "B008B49F58", "B0002S94CK", "B00006HMPC", "B00009YXB4", "B006JN87F2", "B008KJZIR8", "6305487871", "B00005V1WY", "B0050MB3MM", "B002LFPBK6", "B0069RWAL0", "B003X82CZM", "B0007KIFGE", "B002TSAAS8", "B0006J28KA", "B001DJLD1M", "B0000633QW", "B000CNE0M4", "B0045KF754", "B000YDMPBU", "B004SIP9CO", "B008ZQ4WEQ", "B004AOECXI", "B0085Z6ZHE", "B000RPCK1A", "B003A6X166", "B00000IQC4", "1558908404", "B00009KYDL", "B0062NAX1U", "B0034C0GRS", "B001GKJ2E8", "B000QUU7KC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005UW81", "B00175GAHE", "5552642759", "B00102F5YS"]}, "price": 22.48, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 45250}, "asin": "B00004REOG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515WZZ69TNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Omega Code"}
{"description": "Long beforePleasantville, this 1992 comedy featured a family  taking its problems out of the real world and into the loopy fictions of television  entertainment. John Ritter and Pam Dawber star as Roy and Helen Knable, a  suburban couple with a host of marital problems, most of which have to do  with Roy's couch-potato attachment to his TV's remote control. Things take a  hellish turn when the devilish Spike (Jeffrey Jones) turns up at the Knable house offering Roy a great deal on the ultimate satellite-TV system.Surprise, surprise: The contract signed by the less-than-cautious Roy  actually requires a one-time payment of his soul. He and Helen find  themselves sucked into their own television set, where they are kept on the run through such monstrous fare as \"I Love Lucifer\" and \"Northern Overexposure.\"  Eventually, their disenchanted kids (David Tom, Heather McComb) discover mom  and dad are on TV, in a whole new sense of the term, and they set about  rescuing them.A genuine novelty,Stay Tunedis powered along by a chain of  imaginative sequences, most memorably an original cartoon by Warner legend  Chuck Jones that cleverly integrates Ritter and Dawber's characters. The  script's implicit social satire about the overbearing nature of television on  underachieving lives isn't lost on the lively cast or director Peter Hyams  (Timecop), easily one of the most imaginative action filmmakers  around. The old rivalry between television and movies carries on in this  clever parody, and the feud has rarely been so much fun. With tons of  supporting players, including SCTV legend Eugene Levy,Saturday Night  Liveannouncer Don Pardo, and hip-hop performers Salt-n-Pepa.--Tom  Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007TKNEW", "B00LBHOCHS", "B000068MC4", "B00AEFXPG2", "6305433925", "B0006J28LE", "B002XUBDRY", "B0000WN0UU", "B00013WWT8", "6305162018", "B0009PVZCI", "B00008L3W3", "B0000CNY5P", "B00DJYKD0G", "B0000AUHQC", "B0000648ZQ", "B000067FP8", "B000BVM1R8", "B00005JKHX", "B002I41KNC", "B008FYZIYQ", "B00402FGB2", "B0001AW14C", "B0053TWVA0", "B00I2YXN5A", "0767804236", "B0002V7O3I", "B0012RWQJ8", "B002GOAH10", "1573624101", "B00K31RC20", "B005XB8SGO", "B003NH6FY2", "B003156II4", "B000F3UA8E", "B003PIUINI", "B00008979N", "0783225482", "B00005QCVN", "B009B8YNGO", "B000085EF5", "6305308888", "B00AEBB9E6", "B0000VV508", "B002NZK5TG", "B00HW3L9MG", "B00005V9HR", "B00005NKT5", "B0009UZG46", "B00000ILFQ", "B0071HPOHY", "B0091G7BTM", "B00IA1VKVY", "B0019ESNGO", "B0006J28MI", "B00008DDXK", "B001VNVB2G", "B00005T7I1", "B00C7A8WZQ", "B003IQ5YZE", "B005EKWZD6", "B00803PG80", "B0011367SY", "B00C3KTFVU", "B001Q8MMC4", "B000A7Q1UQ", "B000006FQS", "B0006J28LY", "B005DEUETU", "B003NNCLAS", "6305428549", "0790751445", "B0006J28LO", "B000063JDK", "B0009ML1Z2", "B000065V42", "B00079Z9Y6", "B004X63SKQ"], "bought_together": ["B0007TKNEW", "B002XUBDRY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007TKNEW", "B000068MC4", "B003NH6FY2", "B0000648ZQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 80477}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 49.99, "brand": "RITTER,JOHN", "asin": "B00004RF88", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QSWKCA4SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Stay Tuned"}
{"description": "HBO caused a stir when it airedIf These Walls Could Talk, a portrait of three women from three generations (all who occupied the same house at various times) who had unwanted pregnancies. HBO utilizes the same gimmick in the sequel, this time telling the story of women who love women.The three stories ofIf These Walls Could Talk 2are uneven. Far and away the most powerful and moving story is the first, taking place in 1961, starring Vanessa Redgrave as a woman \"widowed\" when her partner of 50 years suddenly dies. Redgrave is phenomenal, and her piece alone makes this sequel worth watching. The 1972 portion stars Michelle Williams, who finds dealing with the sexual politics of the gay community increasingly more complex when she falls in love with a boyish woman (played by Chlo&euml; Sevigny). The most modern piece, taking place in 2000, portrays a contemporary lesbian couple (Sharon Stone and Ellen DeGeneres) determined to have a baby. The light nature of the story detracts from the more serious issues of the earlier segments. Despite the mixed fare, HBO once again proves itself on the cutting edge of moviemaking, with this rather daring film that will both provoke and entertain.--Jenny Brown", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00CLH0APA", "B00002CGGH", "B0001HAGSI", "B000F7CEBG", "B000J4QWIG", "B00023P4M4", "B00006RJ97", "B004BJMEO6", "B008XAGN46", "B00AFDN5Y0", "B00827OWO8", "B00005QW5T", "B002SF9YTS", "B000OVLC0W", "B00009MEB8", "B00011Y1QC", "B000062Y1E", "B00006CXI7", "B004AYMY92", "B00005NRNS", "B0038M61IC", "B00003CWN3", "B000SUKPL6", "B005Q4CLKW", "B00FKPJ3VM", "B004AHAEV4", "B000F3UA6Q", "B00CBG9SQS", "B00GPPXNIK", "B000A4T804", "B004N21KIC", "B0002KPIQY", "B000AQOHN0", "B0045HCJGW", "B005JZBPHS", "B000O76ZO4", "B00003CYJ4", "B004EI2NM2", "B0085E44W8", "B00004YKR3", "B00004STHG", "B0039S3872", "B003YYVSEG", "B003YJFALI", "B0000JD29M", "B00005BKZK", "B00H3RT7M0", "B0037QGS0A", "B0029Z8K74", "B005FLSZHY", "B000PKG8TM", "B00005QJIG", "B00C1LIZEE", "B0009298MU", "B00005OLBC", "B007ZQAKIE", "B000JJRYDI", "B0009VRHLK", "B001QUF3SW", "B0000639HI", "B00005AQMJ", "B001AJIWQE", "0688176887", "B000HT3P4M", "B00HZ6ULZ6", "B00BD9S3TW", "B00ET2ODTE", "B00435KP44", "B00GRZPRB4", "B00BTYJYOY", "B002L1YGRY", "B00EMAGCHE", "B000AM6OVW", "B0009Q0EMY", "B00BDTSLEO", "B00HW3EXCE", "B00009AOBI", "1573441996", "B001G0MFOM", "B00BZW5ZAW", "B000A88ETQ", "B00AG474YU", "B00C4YIFWU", "B00HW3EJ6Y", "B00EOYK616", "6305310335", "B008CJ0KBU", "B00177Y9TS", "1612432298", "B006M3M5FM", "0743291336", "B000069HZO", "B000MRA6XM", "B006UV9LC6", "B005FQ2HEQ", "B000F3UA70", "B00EVKQ2YS", "B003HKN534", "B00AYGVCCK", "B0013LRKUS"], "bought_together": ["B00CLH0APA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000F7CEBG", "B00CLH0APA", "B008XAGN46", "B00AFDN5Y0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 43982}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 13.71, "brand": "HBO HOME VIDEO", "asin": "B00004U104", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41QV7DP3XFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "If These Walls Could Talk 2"}

{"description": "A biography of the first czar of Russia was the final movie project of the great Sergei Eisenstein's life. It would be his undoing, as Stalin was not pleased with part II of this epic. ButIvan the Terrible, Part Istill stands as a magnificent, rich, and strange achievement. This is a \"composed\" film to make Hitchcock look slapdash; every frame is arranged with the eye of a painter or choreographer, the mise-en-sc&egrave;ne so deliberately artificial that even the actors' bodies become elements of style. (They complained about contorting themselves to fit Eisenstein's designs.) If you don't believe movies can be art, this could be (and has been) dismissed as ludicrous. But Eisenstein's command of light and shadow becomes its own justification, as the fascinating court intrigue plays out in a series of dynamic, eye-filling scenes. This is not a political theorist, but a director drunk on pure cinema.Part IIcontinues with the struggle for power and the use of secret police, a controversial segment that caused the film to be banned by Stalin in 1946 (the film was not released until 1958). The predominantly black-and-white film features a banquet dance sequence in color. Obviously the two parts must be viewed as a whole to be fully appreciated. Many film historians consider this period in Eisenstein's career less interesting than his silent period because of a sentimental return to archaic forms (characteristic of Soviet society in the '30s and '40s). Perhaps it was just part of his maturity.Alexander Nevsky(1939), Eisenstein's landmark tale of Russia thwarting the German invasion of the 13th century, was wildly popular and quite intentional, given the prevailing Nazi geopolitical advancement and destruction at the time. It can still be viewed as a masterful use of imagery and music, with the Battle on the Ice sequence as the obvious highlight. Unfortunately, the rest of the film pales in comparison. A great score by Prokofiev was effectively integrated by the Russian filmmaker, but stands on its own merit as well.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000V7HFL4", "6305186774", "B00005A05K", "6305131104", "6305257450", "B0036SPDEG", "0780022343", "B00KE3B6NI", "B00HVOFP6W", "B00007CVS8", "B0000633SD", "B0053TWW6S", "630513104X", "B00HE010LC", "B00F98FOFY", "B0026VBOJW", "B00J2PQYY0", "B00KIZY3XW", "B0053TWWAY", "B00IGK6TGU", "6305081034", "B00GPPXOTS", "B00AQ6J64O", "B00917IPXW", "B0001GH5RY", "B00005BCK0", "B00005J75F", "B0040QYROA", "0780021320", "B00GBT63IC", "B001LMU19G", "B0002JP2OS", "B0006Z2NB8", "B00HVOFP12", "B000025RE7", "B00006JMQG", "B00BX49BAC", "B00HE011DE", "B000PKG6OY", "B00007CVS3", "B00393SFWU", "B00008WJBZ", "B004M66YUS", "B00A8QDHYW", "B00065GX64", "B000AQKUG8", "B0000633SB", "B007N5YK10", "B0009HMTDU", "3980498980", "B00DZP1C3Q", "B002AFX52S", "B002U6DVQ2", "B008Y5OVZ8", "B004ALIG4M", "B00152VXUI", "B00HVOFP9O", "B00GBT637S", "B00F98FOI6", "B00005JKFX", "B00152VXU8", "B0019X400I", "B005152CB4", "B00005M2C7", "B00F98FNNM", "B00I3C1T34", "0780022629", "B000BB14I0", "B00GPPXNEE", "0780022270", "B005HK13PO", "B00005BHW6", "B001WLMOL4", "B001CW7ZSU", "B000K0YLX2", "B0000A02TW", "B00005B1ZL", "B004XC5LRI", "B000BR6QCS", "B003ICZW8M", "B000E5LEVA", "B00827OWSO", "0780023099", "B000WS6YAA", "B00AQ6J5I6", "B00IGK6TH4", "B004NWPY7A", "B00K5EJHGO", "B00EO2I6W4", "B008Y5OWSO", "B00B2BYXYA", "B000LV6OHQ", "B008CJ0JS4", "B000QXDFS0", "B005VU9LP4", "B001WLMOOG", "B000093NQZ", "B000067IY4"], "bought_together": ["B000V7HFL4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["630513104X", "B000V7HFL4", "6305131104", "B0040QYROA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 47909}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 64.96, "brand": "EISENSTEIN,SERGEI", "asin": "B00004XQN5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VAMW92x3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Eisenstein: The Sound Years (Ivan the Terrible Parts 1 &amp; 2 / Alexander Nevsky) (The Criterion Collection)"}

{"description": "After viewing the gay ensemble filmThe Broken Hearts Club--the subtitle of which helpfully points out that it's \"a romantic comedy\"--you might feel as if you've been offered a discussion conundrum not unlike the kind that Mike Myers's Linda \"Coffee Talk\" Richman would put forward: \"The Broken Hearts Clubis neither romantic nor comedic. Discuss.\" What it is, rather, is a gay male version ofSteel Magnolias, right down to the funeral scene and hospital visit. While decidedly less melodramatic than that Southern chick flick, it still aspires to a kind of big-group love-in feeling that's only vaguely comic. And romance? Well, there's some somewhere, when the characters aren't carping about how the only thing they're good at is being gay. They all wrestle with their Big Issues--should Patrick (Ben Weber) donate sperm so his sister can have a baby with her lesbian lover? Will cynical Dennis (Timothy Olyphant) finally admit he loves just-out-of-the-closet Kevin (Andrew Keegan)? How will love-'em-and-leave-'em Cole (Dean Cain) feel when he's rejected by the closeted movie star?--but to little effect, despite some snappy one-liners and occasional keen observances of gay culture. Writer-director Greg Berlanti's screenplay still feels about two or three drafts away from completion, and when faced with stalling action, he opts for a montage set to one of many Carpenters' songs (covers, not the actual hits themselves). Kudos go to the acidic Weber for infusing what could have been a whiny character with a dry, intelligent wit, and the surprisingly charming Cain, who makes Cole someone you can't really hate too much despite all his faults--it would be like hating a puppy. If only all the characters were half as appealing.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008UALE", "0780629167", "B00005QAQD", "B0000639HT", "B0001HAGRE", "B00CMQIDKY", "B0002I84JO", "B0042KZJFA", "1573624381", "B00008R9KD", "B0001HAGRY", "B0013D8LCW", "B00FGG60XY", "B00000F5B5", "B002SSNFUO", "B000K2V7E6", "B00HHYF5EI", "B00GHP8SH4", "B000BZISX0", "B001Y7CVXC", "B00HUQCA28", "B000WDVNMO", "B0084BM7NK", "B00316DDUO", "B00008R9KG", "B00E849QSG", "B00996RSYM", "B00GWWV1XU", "B00GSA3K6C", "B00FPVGWY2", "B0006GVJEY", "B0080JX4Y2", "B0096UG7XY", "B004XKUFY4", "B0004Z3242", "B000HC2M16", "B004L03B3S", "B00DUJH94S", "B000053VAW", "B002PCVLWW", "B000R7G9JW", "B0042L0OFE", "B0083V2VYG", "6305744777", "B006GGREO2", "B007OXB1GI", "B000HWXPXK", "B005GM38MO", "B0000714BP", "B00EU8RB14", "B001CQONPE", "B0000B1A36", "B00005PJ7G", "B000UX6TK2", "B00F98FOPE", "B006FYYWQS", "B003517UWC", "B00004UEDZ", "B0062QHZJU", "B000SQJ28C", "B0001I2BUI", "B00GB0ORJ8", "B00G3MXSW6", "B008JFX04G", "B001NGNLEW", "B0000DD75N", "B002L1YGRY", "B00118S6CY", "B00005JPF3", "B0002Y4PPK", "B000FTJ74Q", "B0012RLX88", "B00E44FEAE", "B002UJIY7A", "0767821009", "1884190618", "0792833198", "B003IG06PM", "B000NVT0UM", "B00CKZE7FC", "B004AR4W4O", "B000EHSV5K", "B00DW5IJR6", "B0007DBJG4", "0767835093", "B000VKJ6UE", "B00099415C", "B00014NE62", "B009J212G6", "B000UNYJOK", "B0001V6ZK2", "B004PQBYVE", "B005C6BGVY", "B007L6JQ3S", "B000CR7R7K", "B0056G1APC", "B008N25X7M", "B000GBEWIO", "B001ATWK4E", "B00B2DGYQS"], "bought_together": ["B00008UALE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00008UALE", "B0000714BP", "B0000639HT", "B000K2V7E6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14209}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.75, "brand": "OLYPHANT,TIMOTHY", "asin": "B0000560PU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516351821PL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Broken Hearts Club"}

{"description": "The world was turned on to the Jimi Hendrix Experience in 1967 with the release ofAre You  Experienced?With a unique electric spin on R&B;, rock, and soul, the  Jimi Hendrix Experience would take the world by storm almost overnight and  become the definitive voice of psychedelic music. By the end of that summer,  Hendrix had become an international superstar.TheExperienceDVD can be broken down into two sections. The first part  is the half-hour documentary filmExperiencefilmed in London 1967. The  second half includes over 40 minutes of bonus material; live footage and music  videos.Experienceis more a collage of footage, including interviews and  \"videos,\" than a documentary. There are a lot better documentaries out there if  historical accuracy is what you are looking for. However, if you want a glimpse  of London in the late '60s and to see a young, optimistic, and happy Jimi  Hendrix,Experiencewill deliver. The bonus material is what makes this  DVD. The live footage is strong and the sound and visual reproduction is  outstanding, particularly on the May 24, 1967, Stockholm performances of \"Wind  Cries Mary\" and \"Purple Haze.\" The highlight is the performance of \"Red House\"  for SAT Swedish television on January 9, 1969; in spite of the obvious tension  between the band members, the performance is perfect. The one low point: with  these great extras and all the yet-to-be-released live footage that is still out  there, one wonders why the DVD included an absurd \"Dolly Dagger\" video shot in  1997 and featuring Fawn Reed and James Hong. It's just awful. Fortunately it's  at the end and doesn't take away from the overall strength of this title.-- Rob Bracco", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009E3234", "B0080QOK70", "B00F031X62", "B004NCOQVA", "B00F031WB8", "B0055IU3GI", "B000AM6N9U", "B001HBH18K", "B000059H94", "B000VI6T6U", "B00000JGNX", "B001NXDSLQ", "B00CA4S2PO", "B00DGRCA4I", "B003YDZV90", "B00328G4XY", "B00F031XPS", "B00DNJ99F2", "B00004Y7ER", "B00AA0TZTW", "B000UJCAJ0", "0879309385", "B0055IU4H6", "0964899418", "B000070GVV", "B000002OW1", "0879306327", "B004TQDLMA", "0060925620", "B0000009TU"], "bought_together": ["B0080QOK70", "B0009E3234"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00F031WB8", "B0080QOK70", "B0009E3234", "B0055IU3GI"]}, "price": 18.0, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 266104}, "asin": "B000056PPJ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41SLhkQrb6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jimi Hendrix: Experience"}
{"description": "The Fall of the House of Usher's success in 1960 spurred American International Pictures to quickly launch another production based on an Edgar Allan Poe story. While producer-director Roger Corman had hoped to next adapt \"The Masque of the Red Death\" (which wasn't produced until 1964),Pit and the Pendulum(the onscreen title) became the second in AIP's long-running Poe series. Set in post-Inquisition Spain, the film stars John Kerr as a young Englishman who travels to the seaside castle of his brother-in-law (Vincent Price) to uncover the circumstances behind the death of his sister (a dubbed Barbara Steele). Price is tormented by memories of his mother's premature burial by his inquisitor father (also Price) and fears that this sadistic legacy has contributed to Steele's demise. Furthermore, he believes that Steele was also buried alive--a belief compounded by the mysterious destruction of her room, and the sound of her harpsichord playing in the night...Structured almost identically toUsher, Richard Matheson's script fleshes out the brief original text with a fast-paced and twist-filled plot that never loses sight of the psychological themes of Poe's work. It also provides Price with the richest of his many AIP/Poe roles, a sympathetic, deeply emotional man who is unhinged by the sins of his father. Corman's direction is equally driven and fluid, and features some impressive quasi-psychedelic visuals in the tense climax. Also noteworthy is art director's Daniel Haller's impressive design of the title set piece. MGM's widescreen DVD features commentary by Corman, which focuses primarily on the film's technical aspects. Also included is the original trailer and a prologue (shot byNorma Raeproducer Tamara Asseyev) featuring costar Luana Anders, which was added to fill out the film's 1968 television broadcast.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005AUK0", "B00009PY4D", "B00009PY4A", "B00009PY45", "B000068TPE", "B00009NHBC", "B001BSBBGC", "B0007R4SZY", "B000068TPF", "B000067DCX", "B00005NSXY", "B008BWFOXM", "B000RO9PUU", "B00000JMOF", "0792846893", "B002945DUW", "B00005K3OD", "B000RXVNDI", "B00005NKTH", "B001SGEUFQ", "B00009PY48", "B00HRUQ8X4", "B005AMJ36U", "B000VUQ4HW", "B0000AGWMC", "B0000AUHOK", "B001PMRBMW", "B0009X770O", "B00B94VJYW", "B0007R4T26", "B005AMJ2ZM", "B000EHSVJG", "B007ZFSBWW", "B008BWFOZA", "B005AMJ3B0", "B001BSBBNK", "B00005LC4K", "B00005JKU0", "B004X63SCY", "B000PWQP9I", "B0075B2G90", "B0000542CL", "B00000JQB7", "B001B9ZVVC", "B00E0FW0M2", "B000062XEY", "B00009NHAB", "B00005AUKA", "B001L5Y78Y", "B009AGEY98", "B000UDGOBG", "B00317LM8S", "B00005AUK3", "B0034PWPHY", "B0016KCCCC", "0767817664", "B00FUABJJQ", "B000P0J0BU", "B0002CX1M0", "B0009X770E", "B00000K3U3", "B00DOZNI8Y", "B000U1ZV7G", "B0000694WH", "B00518A70E", "0790742829", "6304936532", "B000787YRM", "B00009PY38", "B002LBGB7W", "B0000A9GHP", "B004AZ7ZLI", "B006TTC5J0", "B007Y1NNAW", "B00005KHJP", "0783240961", "078323502X", "B00007JMD8", "B000035Z3K", "B000B7MX7A", "B000A0GOFK", "B00006JMQH", "B00DZP1C9K", "B000A0GOF0", "B003MJZ07E", "B0016LFUVQ", "6305944288", "B0038MC1FO", "B00005AUK1", "B0007R4T3A", "B000B7MX70", "B0076ANKTK", "B004P9UWL4", "B00005LC4N", "B004W6JJXC", "B000IMUYJM", "B00BRT3DBQ", "B001DB6J4Q", "B0000542CM", "B0087ZG7UW"], "bought_together": ["B00005AUK0", "B00009PY4D"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005AMJ36U", "B005AMJ3B0", "B00005AUK0", "B0007R4T12"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 44281}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.59, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005AUK4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XYNXSHYJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Pit and the Pendulum (Midnite Movies)"}

{"description": "Keanu Reeves stars in this story that might best be described asBad News Bearsin the projects. Conor O'Neill (Reeves) is a charming ne'er-do-well with a disturbing gambling addiction. His penchant for betting on the wrong teams leaves him owing several thousand dollars to very violent people, and he ends up coaching a children's baseball team to pay off his debt. The movie skimps a bit on process: the kids start out as terrible players and become better but we don't see how; Conor starts caring but we don't see why. As by-the-numbers movies go, though, it isn't a bad one. The young actors in the cast are talented and understated. Most of the kids' characters are only barely fleshed out by the script, but this keeps the movie from being hijacked by extra-cute mugging. Parents should be cautioned--this movie has some very violent scenes that will frighten young children, and swearing is depicted as precocious and adorable. Still, like a baseball game, it isn't a bad way to spend your time.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000KHYN9C", "B00004Y2R1", "B00AMEZDJW", "B00000JGHV", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B002O3Z4XY", "B00AEFXOKO", "B0000633U2", "6305505780", "B00005JPK8", "B004GJYROG", "B0012YYZDG", "B00009AOAX", "078324021X", "B00003CY51", "B00AEFYE08", "B002GIBVWA", "B00005M20J", "B00E1HIWU8", "B0006J28MI", "B005SQRYEG", "B001DJLD12", "B0007LLPXI", "630514415X", "B000068NNU", "B0000JBUHI", "B003VE9WTW", "B00AEFXHNI", "B00DW5IKW0", "B000089771", "B000BITV9W", "1558908390", "B0001MMGC2", "B000089778", "B0010YSD90", "B000056VP4", "B00066FAQW", "B00005A3KS", "B00E1HIX66", "B00005JLG1", "B00005JLRZ", "B00028HBES", "6304821832", "0788815466", "B000FS9ULC", "B00AEFXSLE", "B000069I0E", "B001BP4K22", "0783230338", "B002GSXKOM", "B0010YSD8Q", "B00ANDDBBY", "B00DNF1SSC", "B000069I1K", "630592273X", "B0006GAI5U", "B000PE0GRI", "B000EXZFCQ", "B00006SFL7", "B0060ZJ7BC", "B00006LPH6", "B004GJYRF0", "B002VWNICM", "B004499NII", "B00AEFXGWK", "B000063RQO", "B00007BK2S", "B000053VAX", "6305428271", "B000G0O5I2", "B00008979O", "B0009A40NO", "B00005NRO0", "B00DQCSWUE", "B000WD3XKO", "6305065551", "0783230524", "B004WJT5E2", "B000XSWVEC", "B0000YEE6M", "B002CA68N4", "B000MNOX9E", "B009NNM9OA", "B000089773", "B000J10F14", "B00AEBB9UU", "B0006GANOQ", "B00AEFYKWU", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00007LP8J", "B00AEFY17E", "B002NZK5U0", "B0009K7RMA", "B00595W4CI", "B00L4K3MLE", "B000HDZKLO", "B000BOH8X2", "B000FUTVLY", "B00003W8NT", "0783237367"], "bought_together": ["B00AMEZDJW", "B00004Y2R1"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AMEZDJW", "B002O3Z4XY", "B00DNF1SSC", "B005SQRYEG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10614}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.81, "brand": "Team Marketing", "asin": "B00005JKE4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R4A6RG4XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hardball"}
{"description": "Whether it's a snowy nude sprint down Main Street, the mysterious appearance of a long-lost relative, or the improbable death of yet another of Maggie's boyfriends, life's never dull in the remote hamlet of Cicely, Alaska. Colorful characters and quirky plots propelledNorthern Exposureinto the hearts of millions of viewers, earning the CBS \"dramedy\" series seven Emmy awards between its 1990 debut and its demise six seasons later.In season 1, we meet Dr. Joel Fleischman (Rob Morrow), an urban New York yuppie who consents to four years of rural servitude after Alaska pays his medical-school tuition. Joel's fish-out-of-water adventures drive the show, but it's the quirky ensemble of characters--Chris, the DJ/philosopher (John Corbett), Holling, the bartender (John Cullum), Maurice, the town patriarch (Barry Corbin), Ed, the filmmaker (Darren E. Burrows), and Maggie, the bush pilot (Janine Turner), among others&#x96;-that keeps the series consistently entertaining. The town develops its own offbeat personality as well, a Mayberry-meets-Twin-Peaks  blend of Native mysticism, Aurora Borealis-induced dreams, unlikely tales of long-lost family members, and rumors of a Bigfoot-like creature known simply as \"Adam.\"Northern Exposureprovides a utopian escape--a place where life is interesting but never dangerous, everyone's insightful, the mystical becomes real, and nobody's burdened with a mundane 9-to-6 desk job. Cicely is a delightful place to visit, even if it's only for an hour at a time.A mid-season replacement, season 1 consists of just eight episodes on two DVDs. Each episode includes 5-10 minutes of outtakes and deleted scenes.--Shane Burnett", "related": {"also_bought": ["B006WK4Y8Q", "B00FWMVVK4", "B00FWMVVI6", "B00FWMVVKY", "B00FWMVVHC", "B000002OMG", "B000K7VHJ6", "B000002OT2", "B00D2UMHVA", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B000F8O2MO", "B000TGURZ8", "B00GOC74I4", "B00GHP8SS8", "B0017KP8Y0", "B000EOTTS6", "B000FTC1GW", "B000CQM4YM", "B00GOC74QG", "B000UX6THK", "B000H1RFXM", "B00308BANA", "B000FA57U8", "B0007WQHFS", "B000DZ95IU", "B007USE5CE", "B00I4581F4", "B0000DFZ5O", "B00GLT2TR6", "B008MCKLAM", "B004HJ0ZN2", "B00BNAE6M4", "B003XJABZO", "B008MCKL5W", "B00005Y71F", "B000S0KYTE", "B0027CSMY0", "B0050MB3I6", "B000PHX5KU", "B00DMH1DJA", "B0009NSCRQ", "B00DYQ1G78", "B003R4ZMQI", "B000V6LSO0", "B009LDD4V4", "B0001CCXZW", "B005IA9JQ8", "B0049GYXH2", "B00BPW65OW", "B002C6A6N6", "B00DL48BM6", "B00GOC75YW", "B00HNGC56G", "B00DXLO086", "B00BN3DUVE", "B00KM9MP9I", "B000E1ZBGS", "B00EIXWW2O", "1451666179", "B009DS6YGO"], "bought_together": ["B006WK4Y8Q", "B00FWMVVK4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EOTTS6", "B000V6LSO0", "B006WK4Y8Q", "B00FWMVVKY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 81938}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 13.56, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

{"description": "The plethora of extras on this two-disc set are worth your time. There are several well-produced segments on the physical aspects of the film highlighted by a tour of the vast Cinecitt&#xE0; Studio sets with director Martin Scorsese and production designer Dante Ferretti (with a 360-degree-view feature to boot). Historian Luc Sante introduces you to the Five Corners area in New York circa the mid-19th century, and there's a vintage vocabulary guide (from the 1859 edition ofThe Rogue's Lexicon). Even though it was made as a \"puff piece\" for the movie, the Discovery Channel show \"Uncovering the Real Gangs of New York\" is an informative half-hour on the film's historical background. There's another espresso double-shot from a Scorsese commentary track. Not recorded traditionally as he watches the movie, the track pieces together thoughts from the director including some recorded in an NPR interview. This allows Scorsese to be even more focused, dealing with the history of the time and his own 30-year struggle to make the film. One serious demerit for stretching the feature film over both discs, which most likely had to be done with having both Dolby 5.1 and DTS tracks along with the commentary on the long film.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000M341QE", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00080ZG10", "B00AEBB8NI", "B006OFN0SE", "B00005JLSB", "B000C20VPA", "B000MZHW40", "B001N44BVQ", "B002ZG980U", "B000P0J09M", "B00049QQHI", "B004SIP8ZM", "0767830555", "6305313687", "B0006GAOJA", "B00008975Z", "B0016Q2D66", "B0000DI87S", "B00008DP4C", "B00011CZRE", "B000P0J0EW", "B00004XPPB", "B008R65XYC", "B005LAIIJY", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000C20VRS", "B004SIP95G", "B000286RP2", "B002CPMB9O", "B002T9H2LA", "0307388980", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000A7DVR2", "B00AEFXKUI", "B008MILL8W", "B00AEBB9F0", "B001EZE5DI", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004FQX5B6", "B002QEHPQU", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00H9KKGTO", "B004SIP6GI", "B002VWNIEA", "B0001FGBUW", "B000A2UBN4", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00003CWM3", "B008D1Q1VA", "B00005V9HH", "B003ASLJQI", "B003ASLJQS", "B007SPPANM", "B000093FLA", "B00003CXZ4", "B00004XPPG", "B00001ZWUS", "B000H5TH20", "B000FKO5QK", "B002ZG99N6", "6304711905", "B0018CMJSU", "0767817710", "B009AMANBA", "079284646X", "B000FS9FCG", "B000065U1N", "B00AEBB89W", "B000P0J0AG", "B004SIP6QI", "B001QTXM5Y", "B004499LWG", "0783227906", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000J4P9P8", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00AEBB95K", "B000NOKFHQ", "B002VWNICC", "B00009W5CA", "B004U7MR14", "B004AOECXI", "B00003CXRM", "0783231202", "B000069HZP", "0783229526", "B001JIE7JC", "B00005221M", "B000N6TX1I", "B00005JMJG", "B000N3SRO0", "B00003CXWV", "B00005JMYI", "B003HKN52U", "0790732238", "B00004U103", "B003UESJHO", "B000P0J09C"], "bought_together": ["B000M341QE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002ZG980U", "B000P0J09M", "B0013FXWU6", "B00H9KKGTO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 46244}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.89, "brand": "Miramax", "asin": "B00005JKN9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516W0haa4aL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gangs of New York (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "As the second season aired, the decline in TV ratings and the tepid  sales ofKelly Osbourne's albumindicated that the Osbourne family's 15 minutes were just about up. But this  two-disc set is an indispensable time-capsule keepsake of that brief and shining  moment when Ozzy and his family put their indelible stamp on pop culture as the  stars of the first reality sitcom. For addledheavy-metal pioneer  Ozzy, his fiercely devoted wife and manager Sharon, and two (of three) of  their children--petulant misfit Jack and the more flamboyant pink-haired  Kelly--it was a very good year. They were MTV's top-rated series ever. They graced  magazine covers. They were championed by no less a moral arbiter than Dan  Quayle. Even President George W. Bush got into the act, toasting Ozzy at the  annual Washington Press Club soiree: \"Ozzy, mom loves your stuff.\"The  Osbournesis the kind of series for which the phrase \"instantly addictive\"  was coined. The idea seemed positively batty: Chronicle the lives of the  Osbournes as they settle in to their new Beverly Hills home. They ain't the  Clampetts, as the crates marked \"Dead Things\" indicates. Persistent use of theFword and other obscenities (not bleeped on the uncensored DVD) aside,  the Osbournes at heart are a close-knit, loving family. Or, as Ozzy so tenderly  puts it, \"I love you more than life itself, but you're all f------ mad.\" Episode  4 bears him out, as Sharon and Jack declare war on their noisy next-door  neighbors with airborne foodstuffs.

{"description": "James Bond DVDs have in general been pretty loaded, butDie Another Dayraises the bar with a two-disc set featuring dynamic DTS 6.1 ES and Dolby Digital 5.1 EX sound that makes good use of the rear speakers. The first commentary track is by Pierce Brosnan and Rosamund Pike (who plays villain Miranda Frost). They weren't together at the time, so their comments are spliced into one track. Brosnan has a good time watching and is proud of the film but also doesn't take himself too seriously (\"They don't teach you this stuff at drama school: 'OK, now you're going to be electrocuted by the bad guy.'\"). Self-proclaimed \"Bond novice\" Pike also is proud of the film and says she's annoyed by people who question whether there's still a need for Bond. On the second commentary track, director Lee Tamahori and producer Michael G. Wilson chat about topics as diverse as casting, Bond lore, and product placements. For more Bond lore, don't overlook the trivia track, which offers pop-up tidbits about the filming and tips on the inside jokes.The centerpiece of the second disc is the 80-minute \"InsideDie Another Day\" documentary, which is a set of featurettes strung together. Topics include the opening surfing sequence; the scenes set in North Korea and Cuba (including Halle Berry's bikini tribute to Ursula Andress); the ice palace; post-production elements such as computer graphics, editing, and music; the car battle (finding strong ice was the key safety issue); and the passing of the \"Q\" torch from Desmond Llewellyn to John Cleese.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000NIBURQ", "B000M53GM2", "B000RPCK1U", "B000NDEXPM", "B000M53GMW", "B000RPCK1K", "B000RPCK24", "B000NIBURG", "B000M53GLS", "B000RPCK1A", "B000NIBUR6", "B000M53GN6", "B001PPLIEG", "B001R10BN2", "B00AQSN7HE", "B000RPCK0Q", "B000M53GNG", "B000NIBUS0", "B000NDEXPC", "B00004RG62", "B000M53GMC", "B007REV4T8", "B00004WEJZ", "B00005JL0I", "B009PN18R2", "B008YAPQX4", "B004BR7XLM", "B009PN3OD8", "B003QO8TOQ", "B000HRMAPE", "B000VNMMR0", "B0000BYRO7", "B00AZFECL8", "B000EGDB10", "B004EPYZUS", "B0004Z33EQ", "B00AIBZMD6", "B009A87Z6U", "B009RO9LKK", "B000SK5Z70", "B00003CXMV", "6305657947", "B00005JLYW", "B00005JN2Z", "B00023B1LC", "B005PTYP70", "B00008G8M4", "B00005JNJV", "B00000G3PA", "B000P0J06K", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B002ZG9864", "0792844068", "B00005JKIP", "0792166736", "0790732238", "B00AS1Q93S", "B003Q6D2B4", "B0002I84N0", "B000U1ZV8K", "B008JFURII", "B00JA3RVG4", "B000MZHW40", "B00026ZG10", "0790732149", "B000FKO3HG", "B000AP04FG", "B008JFUS0U", "B0001FGC1U", "B00005JMQW", "B009L6UDUG", "B00AVWIQZS", "B0013BM63O", "B00005JLRT", "B00E5I2M6I", "B001TK80C0", "B00AZMFJYA", "B0007KZQAM", "B002ZG999U", "B00BUAEYVK", "B009A87ZQU", "B000P0J06U", "B008JFUO72", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00003CY0V", "B00E5I2MCM", "B0036TGSR6", "B003AWRMBU", "B0000BYRO9", "B008JFUNHI", "B00177YA1K", "6304696221", "B0021L8V0M", "B00006G8FD", "B000UR9T8C", "B002GNOSFM", "B003UESJFQ", "B0006L0LOS", "B000AYELVU"], "bought_together": ["B000NIBURQ", "B000M53GM2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000M53GM2", "B000RPCK1U", "B000M53GN6", "B000RPCK0Q"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 38500}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "MGM", "asin": "B00005JLBE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51kgPWMuVFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Die Another Day (Widescreen Special Edition)"}

Feeling less than welcome at home after  this, Mitch rents a house near the campus of a nearby college; two of  Mitch's old college buddies, Beanie (Vince Vaughn) and Frank (Will  Ferrell), stop by to cheer him up. They soon become regular guests at  Mitch's place, despite the fact that Frank only recently wed Marissa  (Perrey Reeves), while Beanie and his wife, Lara (Leah Remini), are busy  with two kids. Beanie decides to throw a housewarming party for Mitch,  and since Beanie sells audio equipment for a living, he's able to trick  out the big bash with a massive PA system and an appearance by Snoop  Dogg. Mitch soon finds he's the not-entirely-willing proprietor of the  school's leading party spot, which raises the ire of Pritchard (Jeremy  Piven), a dean at the college who was the target of Mitch, Frank, and  Beanie's abuse when they were all students. Pritchard arranges to have  Mitch's neighborhood zoned into a student housing district, but Beanie  and Frank respond by forming a fraternity and making Mitch's home their  headquarters. Mitch, however, is not enthusiastic about the idea,  especially as he's trying to impress Nicole (Ellen Pompeo), a beautiful  divorcee who is less than enchanted with Frank and Beanie's \"party  hearty\" lifestyle.Old Schooldirector Todd Phillips knows more than a  bit about the seamy side of fraternity life as director of the infamous  unreleased documentaryFrat House.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BKVQS4", "B001G5T6GW", "B000J4P9P8", "B000WZEZGI", "B00005JMYI", "B00005JNZU", "B0016MOV92", "B00AEFXJS6", "B001OD4S50", "B0009HBPN0", "B002ZG99H2", "B00AEFYZCU", "B001J9KJ4I", "B00AEFYPXY", "B000EMGJAO", "B008220BGQ", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B004EPZ084", "B000JJ4DNW", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B00005JKMN", "B000069CF0", "B0000A02TZ", "B008R65XNS", "B002IKIHEG", "B00AEFYAMA", "B000BKJ762", "B003Y5H5B0", "B000IZJZIU", "B00AEBB9K0", "B000CPH9PM", "B00AEBBA2C", "B0050PYNN0", "B003CRM6PA", "B000AP04L0", "630529142X", "B00B65JMEI", "B0006GANPA", "B000TZJBPQ", "B003VPX5Y4", "B002ZG97XI", "B004EPYZS0", "B00466HN7M", "B001C0JCBA", "B0083XXVFW", "B000A7DVR2", "B00029RTAI", "B00CE00ZV8", "B005LAII12", "B00007AJGM", "B008R65XYC", "B00BEIYMZ6", "B000ELJAEM", "B008R65XTC", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEFXVW0", "B00AIQARTU", "B00003CXWV", "B000P0J09M", "B00005JMX6", "B004HO6I2E", "B002BIULKS", "B00AEFZ3XU", "B0012IWNZY", "B00BNWWYE4", "B0023TCWE8", "B00363WGBO", "0783229526", "B00AEBB9DM", "B0002V7TMY", "B000E6EHE0", "B0009X761E", "B00029RTCG", "B0002F6BRE", "B0002I84FI", "B0051MKNRC", "B003BV8IC2", "B00005JL93", "B000EGDBZ6", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00AEFYFWA", "B000P0J09W", "B00DV2MVWO", "B008R65XUQ", "B000M341QE", "B00AEBB9GY", "B00003CXPS", "B000HCPS94", "B005LAII2Q", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00AEFXIUK", "B00407PO3W", "B00AEFY5B6", "B004EPZ06G", "B004LWZW5G", "B00AEFZ8OY", "B003Y5H5C4", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEFYVMO", "B00004Z4WR"], "bought_together": ["B001G5T6GW", "B000J4P9P8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001G5T6GW", "B000WZEZGI", "B000J4P9P8", "B003Y5H5B0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 27583}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JM1F", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MFGXVNN8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Old School (Widescreen Unrated Edition)"}

{"description": "Even though it's only a single disc, the28 Days LaterDVD includes a lot of very interesting features, including the alternate ending that was shown after the end of the film a couple months into its theatrical run.  It's much bleaker, as director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland say in their optional commentary.  Another alternate ending is almost the same as the theatrical ending but slightly less happy.  Most interesting is the \"radical\" alternate ending that takes an entirely different path midway through the film.  It wasn't filmed, however, so Boyle and Garland narrate the action over storyboards, and it's a surprisingly engrossing 11 minutes.  Boyle and Garland also did a commentary track for the film, and they talk about how they were able to get the shots of deserted London and why they used the ending they did.  There are also six very watchable deleted scenes, and Boyle and Garland's comments range from \"great sequence\" to \"a disgrace.\" Slightly less relevant is a 24-minute documentary that spends its first 10 minutes on the real-life threat of infectious diseases before recapping the film and discussing such elements as the use of digital video and the boot camp the actors had to attend. If you need any further proof that the DVD was a labor of love, even the stills galleries have commentaries.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000TJBN80", "B0002ABURA", "B0006A9FKA", "B002WY65VU", "B00111YM5Q", "B0013D8LAE", "B000IHY9TS", "B000Y7U98C", "B00005JO16", "B0021L8UXA", "B0001611DI", "B0013D8LA4", "B000RJO56O", "B002JT69IW", "B001D2WU9I", "B002VWNIDG", "B0002CHK1S", "B00D7AM6M0", "B003UGLCIA", "B00AEFYYH6", "B001MVYUR0", "B000UAE7O0", "B003EYVXYG", "B000EHRVP6", "B0028DRGDQ", "B0021L8UPS", "B001NPD9LS", "B005LAIIMG", "B000FAOC2W", "B000LP6KNU", "B0006SSOHC", "B000WC3864", "B0013FDM7E", "B00000K3TO", "B000RIWAVW", "B000GCFO0I", "B000O76ZQC", "B004LWZW24", "B000RJO578", "B002VKB0KG", "B006ISJR7U", "B00004TS0G", "B004SIP9MY", "B002VKE1K2", "B00G5GNYY2", "B000N6TX1I", "B0024FADD8", "B005QUQRBU", "B001MYIXAC", "B00D3DJIG8", "B001GUYB08", "B000TGJ80S", "B000V4UFZK", "B004SIP92O", "B00009MGEM", "B0010X73ZG", "B00005K3NR", "B002LMSWN2", "B000063RQQ", "B00000ILDD", "B004BZ5AN2", "0767802519", "B00001QGUM", "B00AJLHUA8", "B002SJIO4A", "B00005JMUA", "B00J5LXT6M", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B000AXWHSA", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00005JLWN", "B004BLJQOK", "B0015ET3YO", "B008220BLG", "B000031WD9", "B000069HZP", "B000EQ5SRK", "B0007Y08QA", "B000PMLJMQ", "B000BUNZY2", "B002ZG98UA", "B000V4UH08", "B001JNNDJM", "B003HKN52U", "B003UAKEBW", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0019X3YX2", "B00CE00ZV8", "B00003CXCF", "B0009WFEDC", "B000FS9FE4", "B00005JNJV", "B00011CZRE", "B002T9H2LA", "B000RW5BZ0", "B00005JMXX", "B000WC389G", "B007STBUHI", "B002ZG983M"], "bought_together": ["B000TJBN80", "B002WY65VU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008SAPC20", "B003J42JLC", "B000Y7U98C", "B0002ABURA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 37382}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.25, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00005JMA8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511KHM89SFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "28 Days Later (Widescreen Special Edition)"}

{"description": "Like any DVD blockbuster from producer Jerry Bruckheimer, the extras are plentiful and often a bit too self-congratulatory (worst offender here is the primary commentary track). The slickly (natch) produced making-of documentary goes through the standard routine; however, the less-flashy \"fly on the wall\" bits--just showing what happens on set without comment--is more fun, offering effortless insight on the filmmaking process. The best treasure is a nifty interactive history on pirates with plenty of background material. You can simply play the filmed segments or take a tour around a ship to discover the material (and a few surprises). There's a lot of archival material on the theme-park ride that inspired the film and several odds and ends including an enjoyable chronicle of the vintage ship's voyage from its home harbor to the movie set. The kids should really dig the DVD-ROM \"Moonlight Becomes Ye,\" in which they can turn their own mug into a ghostly pirate. There's also a bounty of extended and deleted scenes (19 in all) and a very funny blooper reel. With both DTS and Dolby 5.1, sound systems will get a workout with the excellent (and loud) sound design.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000I0RQVI", "B000U7WV1Y", "B005COPWZW", "B004A8ZWUQ", "B00005JN5E", "B0013BM63O", "B006VRRGNK", "B00005JKZV", "B00005JPH2", "B0014Z4OMU", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00003CWT6", "B004DTLK80", "B00005JKZY", "B0000A1RJI", "B004M1A21K", "B004DTLK7G", "B00003CXZ1", "B001HN694K", "B001E75QH0", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00005JKCH", "B0087ZG7HK", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B000E6EK2Y", "B000E8M0VA", "B003UYUQZW", "B00AEFYGBA", "B000W746GK", "B00005JMQW", "B0083SBMBM", "B001DHXT20", "B0002234LS", "B000W7F5SS", "B002PMV9FG", "B0002KVUKM", "B004EPYZUS", "B0053FANRC", "B00BEZTMFY", "6304806434", "B000VR0570", "0783231644", "B001OQCV6A", "B000AYELVA", "B008JFUO72", "B005G4TJUC", "B00004R99S", "B00023B1LC", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00003CXI1", "B001HQZJMU", "B00000IRE6", "B0002ZDVEU", "B008QE9XD2", "B00F84H73Q", "B00E5I2MEK", "B003Y5H5EW", "B007K3JFUQ", "B003QO8TOQ", "B000NQRR1Q", "B000YPUF9W", "B001EZE5BU", "B004A8ZWSS", "B0009MDPYM", "B00LG6YEKE", "B002ZG980U", "B002ZG994U", "B000U1ZV8K", "B001DZ8TRW", "B00005JLR2", "B000VWYJ86", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00000JQB5", "B004XKCZAG", "B000W796OM", "B001GCUO0W", "B00AQSN7HE", "B00000ILDH", "B0053FANT0", "B0000VAFO0", "B0002IQMAM", "B000HRMAPE", "B004LWZW7Y", "B008UZA8FY", "B0001HLVS2", "B00007AJGH", "B00005JNJV", "B003YAR97K", "B00CHVJODE", "B000UR9T8C", "B0049IHX2C", "B000G6BLW4", "B00177YA1K", "0783227345", "B0014Z4ON4", "B001TK80C0", "B002O5M4T4", "B00AEBBA72", "B00005JOC9"], "bought_together": ["B000I0RQVI", "B000U7WV1Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005COPWZW", "B000I0RQVI", "B0071JADFU", "B00005JPFX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6260}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.23, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JM5E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51fX40gGdXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}

Michael Caine plays Thomas Fowler, a British journalist in 1950s Vietnam with a lovely Vietnamese mistress named Phuong  (Do Thi Hai Yen) and a jaded view of the political strife teeming around him. He befriends a seemingly innocuous American named Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser), who falls in love with Phuong--and slowly, Pyle's real purpose in  Vietnam becomes revealed. Fowler finds that, to hold on to the carefully balanced life he's created for himself, he must make choices he's long avoided. Caine and Fraser are both superb and give a human face to complicated politics; as a result,The Quiet Americanmanages to be  compelling as both history and a story about very specific people embroiled in a very personal conflict.

{"description": "The sitcom may be flatlining, but as long as there are fresh and original series likeScrubs, the prognosis isn't entirely negative. Created by Bill Lawrence,Scrubsis an interns'-eye view of hospital life and the torturous, tragic, and triumphant route to becoming a doctor. The eminently likeable Zach Braff heads the cast as \"newbie\" J.D., whose years of medical school haven't quite prepared him for chaotic Sacred Heart Hospital.Family Guyhas nothing on the live-actionScrubswhen it comes to surreal asides and fantasy sequences (for example, J.D. literally becomes the proverbial deer in the headlights when he cannot answer a medical query), pop culture references, and TV Land casting (John Ritter guest stars as J.D.'s negligent father in \"My Old Man,\" andSt. Elsewhereveterans William Daniels, Ed Begley, Jr., Stephen Furst, and Eric Laneuville appear as Legionnaire's-stricken doctors in \"My Sacrifical Clam\"). With surgical precision, this inaugural season charts J.D.'s growth as a doctor and a human being, and the close-knit bonds he forms with his equally overwhelmed peers and colleagues, including best friend and surgeon Chris Turk (Donald Faison), beautiful, but raw-nerved and by-the-book Elliot Reid (Sarah Chalke), and supportive nurse Carla Espinoza (Judy Reyes'), who affectionately nicknames J.D. \"Bambi.\" But at the heart of the series is J.D.'s relationship with his mentor, Dr. Cox (an Emmy-worthy John C. McGinley), a cross between Obi-Wan Kenobi and a pit bull. GivingScrubsa further shot of adrenaline are recurring characters Jordan (Christa Miller Lawrence), Dr. Cox's satanic ex-wife, and Neil Flynn as the Janitor, who torments J.D. just as Larry Miller menaced Jerry in theSeinfeldepisode \"The Doorman.\"Scrubs' animated sensibility allows for inexplicable cameos by Jimmie Walker or, at one point, an impromptuWest Side Story-esque dance-off to convey the schism between the surgeons and other doctors. But while hilariously funny,Scrubs, too, can break your heart, as in the two-parter \"My Occurrence\"/\"My Hero,\" with guest star Brendan Fraser as Jordan's spontaneously spirited brother, who is diagnosed with leukemia, and \"My Old Lady,\" in which J.D., Elliot, and Chris experience for the first time losing a patient.Scrubsis one of NBC's few remaining \"Must-See\" series, but it has not been well-served by the network.

{"description": "Despite super effects, a huge budget, and the cinematic pedigree of alien-happy Steven Spielberg, this take on H.G. Wells's novel is basically a horror film packaged as a sci-fi thrill ride. Instead of a mad slasher, however, Spielberg (along with writers Josh Friedman & David Koepp) utilizes aliens hell-bent on quickly destroying humanity, and the terrifying results that prey upon adult fears, especially in the post-9/11 world. The realistic results could be a new genre, the grim popcorn thriller; often you feel like you're watching Schindler's List more than Spielberg's other thrill-machine movies (Jaws,Jurassic Park). The film centers on Ray Ferrier, a divorced father (Tom Cruise, oh so comfortable) who witnesses one giant craft destroy his New Jersey town and soon is on the road with his teen son (Justin Chatwin) and preteen daughter (Dakota Fanning) in tow, trying to keep ahead of the invasion. The film is, of course, impeccably designed and produced by Spielberg's usual crew of A-class talent. The aliens are genuinely scary, even when the film--like the novel--spends a good chunk of time in a basement. Readers of the book (or viewers of the deft 1953 adaptation) will note the variation of whom and how the aliens come to Earth, which poses some logistical problems. The film opens and closes with narration from the novel read by Morgan Freeman, but Spielberg could have adapted Orson Welles's words from the famous Halloween Eve 1938 radio broadcast: \"We couldn't soap all your windows and steal all your garden gates by tomorrow night, so we did the best next thing: we annihilated the world.\"--Doug ThomasWar of the Worldsat Amazon.comThe SoundtrackThe War of the Worlds(1953)War of the Worlds - The Complete First Season(TV series)Classic Sci-Fi Movies and Their RemakesAliens Invade on DVDThe Prog-rock Opera (no kidding)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B00005JL78", "B001SGEUYW", "B00008G8M4", "B00005JL3T", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AEFXNLY", "B00005JMXX", "B001OQCV2E", "B000VECAD0", "B002O3Z510", "B0002V7OI8", "B000H30B2C", "B000EGDB10", "B00005JN2Z", "B005LAIIMG", "B005PTYP70", "B002O3Z50G", "B0002V7ON8", "B00005JN0T", "B00K2CHW48", "B002SJIO4A", "0783225547", "B008JFUO36", "B00005JKLZ", "B00AS1Q93S", "1936594056", "B004EPYZUS", "B001TUZG4K", "B00AEFXR1K", "B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFXYJA", "0767817478", "B0034G4ORC", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00070FX5U", "B0045HCJSA", "B00000G3PA", "B005LAIHPE", "B003Y5H5GK", "B00AEBBA72", "B00003CWU3", "B00I9TDMRM", "B001ECDVKE", "B00003CXXP", "B000V4UFZK", "B0010X73ZG", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00005JKFR", "B000XT1P4S", "B003HKN52U", "B0009PW4D2", "B000HRMAPE", "B004EPYZPS", "B0018QPPXW", "B0002WZTOI", "B00AEBB9LO", "B004LWZW4M", "B003ABZHAO", "B003YJFALS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B000OT6V64", "B004P7CN7W", "B000CCBC9O", "B00000ILDD", "0767803434", "B001L57ZYM", "B000065V3G", "B007STBUHI", "B002ZG980U", "B008JFUQZ2", "B00005B6JZ", "B0006GANOQ", "B000F1IQN2", "1494343576", "B001GCUO02", "B00004Y87O", "0783226810", "B004EPYZSK", "B000P0J0BU", "B005LAIHXQ", "B001680M26", "B000EQHXN2", "B0045HCJFS", "B00004BZIY", "B00008G8M5", "B00003CXQA", "B008JFUS0U", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00EIN6KJ0", "B0000DZ6N3", "B000MV8A9A", "B00005JKYX", "B0000YEEGM", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B0013FCWUW", "B002ZG9864", "B00003CWTI", "B008MIMWQW", "B00IKM5OCO"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBB8VK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B004LWZW4M", "B00005JL78", "B004EPYZSK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18739}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JNTI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51upxzPRnXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "War of the Worlds"}
{"description": "In the DVD world, the Criterion Collection label generally indicates that you'll be getting your money's worth on the extras, andThe Life Aquatic with Steve Zissouis no exception. These two discs contain many features that fans of the film will expect: Seu Jorge performing David Bowie songs (complete versions), many documentary scenes of writer-director Wes Anderson at work, interviews with cast members including Cate Blanchett, Bill Murray, etc. Other extras are a little more confusing. For instance, does Seymour Cassel, who plays Zissou's deceased partner, know what he's doing when he complains to a hairless cigar merchant about having to go faux bald? And what's the deal withMondo Monda? It's a cringingly awkward Italian talk show in which the host (also an actor in the film) interviews the screenwriters, throwing out references so random and esoteric that even smart guys like Anderson and Noah Baumbach are left speechless. It's all a joke, right? In the end, the bonus material accomplishes its primary goal: get those who already enjoy the film to like it just a little bit more.--Leah Weathersby", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0010X8NF0", "6305428239", "B0000640VJ", "0767821408", "B007L6VR12", "B001QOGYBI", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B007L6VR6M", "B000CS464G", "B0006TPE4C", "081099741X", "B00005JMJ4", "B000934FC2", "B0035G5IOE", "B00JAQJNN0", "B00005JMJG", "B000BRD6T4", "B0045NXMJE", "B00007AJF8", "B00H9HZITU", "B0018BD9DA", "B004SEUIXS", "1623160510", "B001P3SA8K", "B000JMK6LW", "B0018O4YT0", "B001MM3AZM", "B0006H32EI", "B002E2M5IC", "B0012E2GFK", "B000M4RG7E", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000Y7U98C", "B001NPD9PY", "B00IJXJAIS", "B000A7DVR2", "B008MIMWP8", "B004FQX5B6", "B00GKOJ98E", "0783228457", "B000K7VHOG", "B002LMV7RA", "B00008RH3J", "B0009A40ES", "B00DL46ZN8", "0957490909", "B000F5GNX8", "B00005JLRE", "B00006AUIH", "B00005V9HH", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B001JIE7JM", "B000IU37SO", "B004RQDQIQ", "B00AEBB8SS", "B00006LPGP", "B00000K3TS", "B00H9L28OO", "B007D5E7C2", "B000065AI3", "B0033WH6MW", "B008220D5K", "B0014D5RBE", "B001BPJJ9G", "B00005JL78", "B007D0FVRM", "B00AEFYOJE", "B00003CXZ4", "6304493681", "B0083V2W4U", "B000Z8GZYW", "B008R65XNS", "0783229526", "B00HGGUTPW", "B003UESJMO", "B005HK13SG", "B000P0J0EW", "B002VWNIAY", "B000P0J0D8", "B004SIP7ZS", "B001HN69AY", "B003XURDAY", "B00H7KJRVY", "B00ECR7KX2", "B001GMAVGE", "B005LAIIJY", "B000055Y0X", "B0000AC8LR", "B000K7VHQE", "B00AEFYAMA", "6305922756", "B0041T52S6", "B009YQJ322", "B003CRM6PA", "B002T9H2LA", "B000O76ZQC", "B0040QYROA", "B005MYEQ4U", "B00I6JOD2S", "B00FZ4KR4U"], "bought_together": ["B0010X8NF0", "B0000640VJ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00JAQJMJ0", "B0010X8NF0", "B007L6VR12", "B0000640VJ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 72305}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.5, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JNLQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H5Q2VBE1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (The Criterion Collection)"}

{"description": "The trend is to convertmovies into stage musicals, butThe Producersgoes a step further: making a feature film of the smash-hitstage musicalthat was adapted from the1968 film. The chief drawing card, of course, is Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprising their roles from the stage. Lane plays Max Bialystock, a legendary Broadway producer who hasn't had a hit show in a long time. Enter nebbish accountant Leo Bloom (Broderick), who tells Bialystock he could actually make more money with a flop than a hit. So the two set out to produce the worst Broadway musical of all time, one guaranteed to close on opening night, with the collaboration of an outrageous cast of characters: Will Ferrell as sieg heil-ing author Franz Liebkind, Uma Thurman as Swedish bombshell Ulla, Gary Beach as director Roger De Bris, and Roger Bart as his assistant, Carmen Ghia, among others.As directed and choreographed by Susan Stroman (who did the same honors on Broadway) and co-written by Mel Brooks,The Producersis laugh-out-loud funny. It's also a relentlessly over-the-top, shamelessly bawdy, stereotype-ridden comedy that may turn off its audience just as much as its centerpiece,Springtime for Hitler, was intended to. But Broadway fans who are used to larger-than-life figures who play to the back row while showering the first row with spit, are likely to forgive and just enjoy the famous granny-walker dance, a supporting cast dotted with Broadway performers (playing a taxi driver is Brad Oscar, who originated the role of Liebkind on Broadway then later played Bialystock), or the mere spectacle of seeing Lane and Broderick memorializing the performances that millions never got a ticket to see. (For maximum laughs, stick around through the closing credits.)--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BMY2LU", "B00005AY6I", "B000BJS4TE", "B00005OCJO", "B00C7A8X4Q", "B004SEUJBE", "B000G6BLYC", "B000E6ESIK", "0786868805", "B0001ZX0O2", "B000E1YVZU", "0792844890", "0792833198", "B001LMAKAG", "B00AEBBAEK", "B000077VR3", "B00007GZRN", "B00001PE59", "B0007TKNII", "B009NYF2GQ", "B0013Z7RUC", "B000G6BLVA", "B002D0L0R2", "B0001Z4OXS", "B002NZK5TG", "B000G6BLWE", "B000G6BLW4", "B000G6BLQU", "B007XTDWKQ", "B00003CX8U", "B0038Z5SOM", "B000BITUNE", "B000E6ESJ4", "B0000AM6IY", "B00008973A", "B000G6BLRE", "B00004W5VC", "B000ATQYVK", "630530209X", "B00GTO6WXU", "6304806418", "B00004XMTJ", "B0060QSGJ0", "B001GKJ2DY", "B002JT69LE", "B001MT7ZEW", "B000I2J6YG", "B000ASDFGI", "0783240287", "B00AMQGCD6", "B005S9EK5Y", "B007LNBS2I", "B0000BWVMQ", "B002D0L0QS", "B000RPCK2E", "B000649YA2", "B00004RFEZ", "B00BX8PG3Y", "B008SBXFUU", "B00AEFYVUQ", "B005NFJAZS", "B0090XLDKY", "B00007J5VN", "B00005UQ8F", "B001PO550A", "B00005JLIU", "B00020X88E", "B00AEFY5TI", "B00DHN8GBC", "B00005JL1P", "B00KRFE9UK", "B00005OCMS", "B002ZG976U", "B00003CXJA", "B004H0M2X2", "B006GHA9QQ", "B000NTM9ZM", "B002N1C1CO", "076781326X", "B00067BBLY", "B000BT970O", "B000BYA4J2", "B00006D295", "B000067IZ3", "B005SFR7YE", "B001MVYUQ6", "B00AATV0WS", "B00DL48BM6", "B000G6BLT2", "B004VJJFDE", "6305161879", "B0000714BP", "B002HK9IDQ", "B001KP2J3K", "B00AEFXDO6", "B00EPH8SBM", "B0000BZK1R", "B00006RZ9Y", "B00005O3VC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BMY2LU", "B000E6ESIK", "0792844890", "B004SEUIWO"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 391998}, "asin": "B00005JO24", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514E4E65KRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Producers"}
{"description": "Critics and controversy aside,The Da Vinci Codeis a verifiable blockbuster. Combine the film's huge worldwide box-office take with over 100 million copies of Dan Brown's book sold, andThe Da Vinci Codehas clearly made the leap from pop-culture hit to a certifiable franchise. The leap for any story making the move from book to big screen, however, is always more perilous. In the case ofThe Da Vinci Code, the plot is concocted of such a preposterous formula of elements that you wouldn&#x92;t envy screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, the man tasked with making this story filmable. The script followsDan Brown&#x92;s bookas closely as possible while incorporating a few needed changes, including a better ending. And if you&#x92;re like most of the world, by now you&#x92;ve read the book and know how it goes: while lecturing in Paris, noted Harvard Professor of Symbology Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is summoned to the Louvre by French police to help decipher a bizarre series of clues left at the scene of the murder of the chief curator. Enter Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), gifted cryptologist. Neveu and Langdon team up to solve the mystery, and from there the story is propelled across Europe, ballooning into a modern-day mini-quest for the Holy Grail, where secret societies are discovered, codes are broken, and murderous albino monks are thwarted&#x85; oh, and alternative theories about the life of Christ and the beginnings of Christianity are presented too, of course. It&#x92;s not the typical formula for a stock Hollywood thriller. In fact, taken solely as a mystery, the movie almost works--despite some gaping holes--mostly just because it keeps moving. Brown&#x92;s greatest trick was  to have the entire story take place in one day, so the action is forced to keep moving, despite some necessary pauses for exposition. As a screen couple, Hanks and Tautou are just fine together but not exactly memorable; meanwhile Sir Ian McKellen&#x92;s scenery-chewing as pivotal character Sir Leigh Teabing is just what the film needed to keep it from taking itself too seriously. The whole thing is like a good roller-coaster ride: try not to think too much about it--just sit back and enjoy the trip.--Daniel VanciniVisit The Da Vinci Code StoreOn The DVDThe DVD extras on a film as popular asThe Da Vinci Codeshould be plentiful, and this version doesn&#x92;t skimp. With over 90 minutes of special features, including ten behind-the-scenes featurettes, there&#x92;s a lot here to explore beyond the film itself. The question is, is there anything new here that we haven&#x92;t heard before, in all the hype, pseudo-documentaries, and controversy surrounding the movie, to make it worthwhile?  For most viewers, the answer will be \"yes.\" Essentially, if you like the movie, if you enjoyed the book, you will get a lot out of them.Just as the movie is intended to make the book come to life, the DVD extras should make the film come to life by pointing the audience into the world of the filmmakers, connecting the dots between print and film, and for the most part they do just that. The extras here range from the typical look behind-the-scenes to more in-depth features on the supporting characters, the locations, and theMona Lisaherself.  \"First Day on the Set with Ron Howard\" features the director gushing about the opportunity to film in the Louvre and work with Tom Hanks again (the two worked together before onSplashandApollo 13). It&#x92;s a short piece that doesn&#x92;t reveal much beyond making an attempt to share Howard&#x92;s excitement (with the \"Gee, I really loved working with him/her on this project\" that you hear in every such featurette), but viewers might enjoy seeing how the stage was set up in the famous museum, down to the spike tape on the floor showing actors where to hit their marks.The Filmmaking Experience, Parts 1 and 2further explores the creative and technical aspects of the filmmaking process.A Conversation with Dan Brownstarts out feeling like a puff-piece (the man who wrote this book got started at age 5 with a story calledThe Giraffe, The Pig, and the Pants on Fire. \"It was a thriller,\" he says.) and unfortunately it doesn&#x92;t go very deep into much of anything of interest. But on the other hand, this isn&#x92;t60 Minuteshere; it&#x92;s intended to give viewers a better sense of the man behind the franchise, which it does.  Much of the footage from this interview is sprinkled throughout some of the other featurettes. Meanwhile, the character behind the franchise, Robert Langdon, is examined in his own featurette, as is Sophie Neveu. The cool thing here is getting under the skin of the actors to see how they approached the characters, knowing that most of the movie-going public already has formed their own ideas about the characters from the book.The most interesting extras are the featurettes that focus on the history behind the mystery. Or is it the mystery behind the history?  Either way, the first one on theMona Lisa, and the second featurette on the many codes and symbols that are hidden throughout the movie balance out the remainder of the extras nicely by demonstrating the sense of intrigue, mystery, and game-playing adventure that madeThe Da Vinci Codeso popular in the first place.--Daniel VanciniBeyondThe Da Vinci CodeThe Films of Tom HanksThe Films of Ron HowardThe Da Vinci DVDs: Decoding \"The Da Vinci Code\"More About The ArtistStills fromThe Da Vinci Code(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00005JN5E", "B0013BM63O", "B002ZTQVKM", "B0007XG02W", "B001OLP2TI", "B002C68WNW", "0307474275", "B002O5M4SU", "B00005JLSB", "B000PHVZNE", "B0077ATSSQ", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000EPR7NE", "0743486226", "B001LMAK9W", "B000P0J0EW", "0385504209", "B005HWAOP2", "B001OQCV2E", "B0013XZ2QK", "B001EZE5D8", "B00005JL3T", "B000EOTW0Q", "6304711891", "B000YDBPAM", "0307950689", "B000HT386M", "B00008G8M4", "B000P0J0EM", "B002ZG99KO", "0800141806", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00001ZWUS", "B0002V7OI8", "B002O3Z50Q", "B0006GANOQ", "B002NZK5UU", "B000NQRR1Q", "0385504225", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00005Y71F", "B000OYC7BW", "B00DL48BM6", "B00026ZG10", "B0018CWW5K", "B00004BZIY", "B0000B1OFL", "B00023B1LC", "B000N6U0E2", "B00A8MGIZG", "B00005JM5E", "B002LMV7R0", "B00004Z4WR", "B000K2UGXO", "B00005JMYC", "B001MVYUQG", "B00005JLWN", "B000056PMU", "B0000AOV4I", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00441GYXS", "B001F12J0C", "B00ES28X3C", "B002ZG980U", "B001VLBDD0", "B00008K76U", "B001TK80C0", "B008JFURII", "B000VWYJ86", "0792159659", "B00AEFYGBA", "B0009MDPYM", "B00177YA1K", "B00005N5S5", "B0043X1FM2", "B0002J58HO", "B00005JM5B", "B00AZMFJYA", "B003AWRMBA", "074349346X", "B003VA3JUO", "0783240295", "6305767866", "B0000844I8", "B000065U1N", "B002GHHHKQ", "B000K7VHQE", "B0000AXE8I", "0800177258", "B000ASDFGI", "B003Q6D2B4", "B000HRMAPE", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JMOW", "B00GPWEPZ8", "0312944926", "B000VI70QS", "B000KF0GWW"], "bought_together": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00005JN5E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00I563DSC", "B0013BM63O", "1400079152"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7555}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.5, "brand": "DaVinci", "asin": "B00005JOC9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SLBDLMtIL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Da Vinci Code (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)"}
{"description": "The lurid scenario--a nymphomaniacal white trash nymphet (Christina Ricci) is held prisoner by a bitter bluesman (Samuel L. Jackson)--gives way to an affecting tale of redemption inBlack Snake Moan, writer/director Craig Brewer's follow-up to the acclaimedHustle & Flow. Lazarus (Jackson,Jungle Fever,Pulp Fiction) finds Rae (Ricci,Monster,The Ice Storm) beaten unconscious on the road in front of his backwoods house. After bringing her inside, he learns of her wanton ways and decides to exorcise his own demons by curing Rae of her sexual compulsion.Black Snake Moancould have been terrible, but Brewer takes his story seriously enough to dig into the genuine emotions of such a situation (though along the way he certainly flirts with sexploitation overtones--several scenes look like they were plucked straight out of a hitherto unknown 1970s trash classic). Ricci, Jackson, and the supporting cast (including pop star Justin Timberlake, giving a surprisingly good performance as Rae's boyfriend) treat the characters with respect, honesty, and humor. The result is off-kilter and maybe a little too fond of its sleazy cinematic forbears to truly hit the emotional notes it's after, butBlack Snake Moanhas considerably more substance than its marketing would suggest.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B003IY498Y", "B00AEFYAC0", "B0029Z8K74", "B000NO39FG", "B0050ODZ6M", "B000L211NC", "B004P7CN3G", "B000HC2M0C", "B001URA5Y8", "B000Q6GUSO", "B00006SFJJ", "B0037QGS0A", "0767821009", "B008B9JTLI", "B002PB4I50", "B003HTSJAY", "B00DHDDE1Y", "B00008Z463", "B00005R87R", "B00005JMON", "B0004Z3242", "B000092T3X", "B00AEBB89W", "B007ZC31R0", "B00008972P", "B00005JLD1", "B000JBXHQY", "B003VA3JZY", "B00005JH9M", "B000MZHW40", "B000JMK6OE", "B0041KKZGY", "B0002A2WDQ", "B0006210ZG", "B0017M9ZNI", "6305127654", "0780618548", "B0033PSH68", "B001JNNDJM", "B00AEBBA72", "B000OCZ9WS", "B000KX0IM2", "0790776960", "B000OYC7BW", "B00004ZETA", "B002NZK5VO", "B0002KPIQY", "B00005JKJA", "B0007V6ITE", "B000FAOC2W", "B00112S8RS", "B0020LH8WU", "B000RGX0EK", "B002DKGWSE", "6305065551", "B002AT8K9W", "B00005JP4N", "0780625528"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003IY498Y", "B00AEFYAC0", "B0029Z8K74", "B000NO39FG"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JP97", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5171vu3790L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Black Snake Moan [Theatrical Release]"}
{"description": "One of the first things a viewer notices aboutCloverfieldis that it doesn't play by ordinary storytelling rules, making this intriguing horror film as much a novelty as an event. Told from the vertiginous point-of-view of a camcorder-wielding group of friends,Cloverfieldbegins like a primetime television soap opera about young Manhattanites coping with changes in their personal lives. Rob (Michael Stahl-David) is leaving New York to take an executive job at a company in Japan. At his goodbye party in a crowded loft, Rob&#x92;s brother Jason (Mike Vogel) hands a camcorder to best friend Hud (T.J. Miller), who proceeds to tape the proceedings over old footage of Rob&#x92;s ex-girlfriend, Beth (Odette Yustman)--images shot during happy times in that now-defunct relationship. Naturally, Beth shows up at the party with a new beau, bumming Rob out completely. Just before one's eyes glaze over from all this heartbreaking stuff (captured by Hud, who's something of a doofus, in laughably shaky camerawork), the unexpected happens: New York is suddenly under attack from a Godzilla-like monster stomping through midtown and destroying everything and everybody in sight. Rob and company hit the streets, but rather than run with other evacuees, they head toward the center of the storm so that Rob can rescue an injured Beth. There are casualties along the way, but the journey into fear is fascinating and immediate if emotionally remote--a consequence of seeing these proceedings through the singular, subjective perspective of a camcorder and of a story that intentionally leaves major questions unanswered: Who or what is this monster? Where did it come from? The lack of a backstory, and spare views of the marauding creature, are clever ways by producer J.J.

Paterson and her son, producer-screenwriter David Paterson, also recall how an actual incident in David's life inspired the book. A six-minute visual-effects featurette looks at the film's creatures from sketch to computer design to screen, including how the features of the school kids helped shape the creatures. Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb, \"chaperoned\" by producer Lauren Levine, recount their experiences on one commentary track, while the second, by director Gabor Csupo, writer Jeff Stockwell, and producer Hal Lieberman, is drier but informative. Topics covered include praise for young Bailee Madison, how Zooey Deschanel wouldn't have been considered a predator back in the '70s, and the somewhat-controversial marketing campaign that focused heavily on the film's fantasy elements.

{"description": "The Dark Knightarrives with tremendous hype (best superhero movie ever? posthumous Oscar for Heath Ledger?), and incredibly, it lives up to all of it.  But calling it the best superhero movie ever seems like faint praise, since part of what makes the movie great--in addition to pitch-perfect casting, outstanding writing, and a compelling vision--is that it bypasses the normal fantasy element of the superhero genre and makes it all terrifyingly real.  Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is Gotham City's new district attorney, charged with cleaning up the crime rings that have paralyzed the city. He enters an uneasy alliance with the young police lieutenant, Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), and Batman (Christian Bale), the caped vigilante who seems to trust only Gordon--and whom only Gordon seems to trust. They make progress until a psychotic and deadly new player enters the game: the Joker (Heath Ledger), who offers the crime bosses a solution--kill the Batman. Further complicating matters is that Dent is now dating Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, after Katie Holmes turned down the chance to reprise her role), the longtime love of Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne.In his last completed role before his tragic death, Ledger is fantastic as the Joker, a volcanic, truly frightening force of evil. And he sets the tone of the movie: the world is a dark, dangerous place where there are no easy choices.  Eckhart and Oldman also shine, but as good as Bale is, his character turns out rather bland in comparison (not uncommon for heroes facing more colorful villains). Director-cowriter Christopher Nolan (Memento) follows his critically acclaimedBatman Beginswith an even better sequel that sets itself apart from notable superhero movies likeSpider-Man 2andIron Manbecause of its sheer emotional impact and striking sense of realism--there are no suspension-of-disbelief superpowers here. At 152 minutes, it's a shade too long, and it's much too intense for kids. But for most movie fans--and not just superhero fans--The Dark Knightis a film for the ages.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B000PC6A3E", "B002ZG981E", "B00G4RD4PQ", "B0039208QM", "B001GMALGY", "B00E2Y0YBK", "B00C2IGQBA", "B0039208JE", "B00H14WTLQ", "B0039208CG", "B0085D3I3K", "B0039208C6", "B000M5AJQI", "B00319ECGK", "B001FB55H6", "B00EIG5M5A", "7020070078", "B00E2Y6AUY", "B00D5FMGGS", "B001OQCV6K", "B0013FBS20", "B000Q6GX5Y", "B001GKJ2FC", "B00FPS79F6", "B001992NUQ", "B004JMSIRC", "B001RIY4WE", "B00DYEN6XC", "B008QZ5PY2", "B001F7MSG6", "B00FAHYNWE", "B00J7PRJXU", "B001AQT0Z4", "B001UV4XEW", "B0083SBJXS", "B00AEFY552", "B00C8RD79O", "B007KAJG3K", "B007L4HET8", "B004EPZ07U", "B007L4HFDI", "B00AEFXKOO", "B000PC0U1W", "B00C6B8TB8", "B00HINFI4K", "B003TT2X6I", "B001KZIRM2", "B002ZG99NG", "B00EZ4M68G", "B004SIP90G", "B003ZHR6RK", "B001GCUO16", "B003TT2X6S", "B00JNEWSLS", "B001F3FUK6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B002ZG981E", "B000PC6A3E"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPY0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pGxSkkz4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Dark Knight [Theatrical Release]"}

{"description": "LikeCarriebefore it,Ginger Snapsuses horror-movie conventions as an inspired metaphor for puberty. When beautiful but reclusive goth teenager Ginger (Katharine Isabelle) is attacked by a monstrous wolf on the eve of her first period, her body starts changing in a big way, as do her suddenly lusty, feral appetites. Director John Fawcett masterfully balances the expectations of teen horror exploitation (blood, bodies, sex, smart dialogue, and good old-fashioned monster-movie scares) with clever black humor and tender sisterly solidarity. Only devoted sister Brigitte (gloomy Emily Perkins) knows the truth, and even as Ginger's abrupt transformation threatens their once unbreakable friendship, bonds of blood and love keep them together: Brigitte disposes of Ginger's victims while searching for a cure. Mimi Rogers costars as their dotty but unexpectedly sensitive mom, ready to sacrifice all to protect her daughter. Blood and blood ties have never been more evocative.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 368000}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Ginger Snaps", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001EFV7M", "B0002I84DK", "B00009MEC4", "B004P7CN3G", "B001AR0D5Y", "B00BSU0FQA", "B000RW5BZ0", "B0002S9QT6", "155890848X", "B000U1ZV7Q", "B0024FADD8", "B00AEBB91E", "B000P0J056", "B002USF1WC", "B000OCY7TY", "B005TG8156", "B008NNY8XQ", "B0013D8L7M", "B003WTO5NO", "B00009OWI1", "B00IXD2MWK", "B0002C4JJ4", "B00DPUB56U", "B009XTF8KQ", "B004EI2NP4", "B008G33PIM", "B005Y1B3EW", "B002LMSWN2", "B00CERJI5U", "B0028DRGDQ", "B000IMUYJM", "B000VSDNFA", "B000067J0M", "B000BYA5HS", "B00000I1KK", "B000HC2M0C", "B001CT876C", "B0014VPFVS", "B005SQRYB4", "B003Y5H54W", "B0031U8OEK", "B001I82RVS", "B008CYDD7I", "B001B8XRT6", "B002EOVXBK", "B003EYVXSW", "B0001FVDQ4", "B000A6T1ZY", "6305238065", "B000PMLJMQ", "B00023BM4S", "B0053TWVQE", "B00BTYPW7C", "B004AC6PV2", "B001MEJY8W", "B00B58FWTU", "B00006G8H3", "B00005JOWW", "B000096I9V", "B002OVO18A", "B0040J1RX6", "B00J4LMJ3W", "B003IY498Y", "B002FUI4U6", "B00K2CHVSK", "B00006CXGP", "B0007A0F4O", "B008DVJOQ4", "B000NVT0TI", "B00B999FBG", "B008DVJOQY", "B00004W4UD", "B0040GMPEE", "B00009PY2T", "B001MYIXAC", "B0053TWVIM", "B00K2CHWYI", "B008874968", "B003Q6D246", "B000FS9FE4", "B000I2J68M", "B002E01MHY", "B003L20IEW", "B0009X76XC", "B004FUPK6U", "B00EMAGIKU", "B009IV2Z3M", "B0007WQHI0", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B000056T5E", "B002ZG97CO", "B00AGKH4MG", "B000EOTVU2", "B000MEYKCI", "B00AEFYV9W", "B000WC389G", "B0002C9DK4", "B005OT810I", "B004ZQJ5GK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00JJ3EHCG", "B00KHWSB5M", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B00LT1JHLW"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GFJATFWHL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "B00005NKSD"}
{"description": "After an eight-year hiatus, George Romero makes his long-awaited cinematic return with the visceralBruiser, a savage and unsettling take on Kafka'sThe Metamorphosisas aDeath Wishrevenge fantasy. Jason Flemyng stars as an emotional doormat who, ground down by years of abuse by his boss (Peter Stormare) and humiliation by his wife, wakes up one morning to find his face missing. He's the ultimate anonymous man, and he's mad as hell and not going to take it anymore. Painting his masklike visage like a tribal warrior, he hunts down and kills his tormentors. Romero takes an odd pleasure in Flemyng's perverse self-help campaign, as if his savage explosion is some form of primitive personal growth. Lacking the irony and complexity of Romero's best work (Dawn of the Dead,Martin),Bruiserturns into little more than a sophisticated revenge picture with inspired moments of black humor.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00KDU8HQQ", "B0013D8LAE", "0792841328", "B0014VPFVS", "B00J5LXTUI", "069220315X", "B00INLE540", "B00G5GNYY2", "B000MM0LEG", "B00EVU3RSW", "0792841336", "B000JLPMPS", "B00EF0NY7W", "B00A429Y9M", "B00008WFU5", "B00D7AM71A", "630512003X", "B009IV2Z3M", "B000RIWAV2", "B004XQO8LY", "0783227434", "B00DPUB56U", "B007PK9MTI", "B00GHH9IIA", "B0013D8L7M", "B00CPTUNZG", "B003JFCG82", "B00BSU0FQA", "B007XF0XUW", "B003Q7B79M", "B00009NHC0", "B00125WATQ", "1573625485", "B000059H96", "B00BTYPW7C", "B0009X768W", "B000HT38B2", "B00AWHDEM2", "B001152TL6", "B000GIXCM4", "B002LMSWN2", "B00344EAPK", "B000RIWAVW", "B000CFYAMC", "B000HWZ4N4", "B000WC38FU", "B006OEPRT0", "B000MV8ZDQ", "B0009RQRQU", "B000059H87", "B00006G8HR", "B000BC8T3C", "B0000AYLJF", "B000067J0H", "B008BWFOUU", "B000J10EQK", "B00B58943U"], "bought_together": ["B0013D8LAE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0061134104", "B0002F6AY8", "B0013D8LA4", "B00005JO16"]}, "price": 8.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 146250}, "asin": "B00005NQGM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51n%2BtySlGQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bruiser"}

It is now present day, and this elaborate cathedral still stands. But when its sealed crypt is accidentally reopened, a group of people trapped inside the church become possessed by the fury of the damned. Can the blood of the innocent survive this unholy communion or will the ultimate demonic evil be unleashed upon the world?The Church was co-written and produced by maestro Dario Argento (Suspiria) and sealed the reputation of director Michele Soavi (Stagefright, Cemetery Man) as the new master of Italian horror.

{"description": "Fans ofSpace: 1999(and there are many of them) are lavish in their praise for British producer Gerry Anderson's mid-'70s sci-fi series. They rhapsodize about provocative, seriously scientific story lines, expensive production values, the presence of star (and future Oscar&reg; winner) Martin Landau, and more. But there are others who look at the series' glacial pace, loopy costumes and makeup, cheesy sets, primitive special effects, stilted dialogue, and self-serious tone and wonder what planet those rabid fans are from.This two-disc set includes the first six episodes of the show's second season.  Episode 25, \"Metamorph,\" introduces Maya (Catherine Schell), a shape-changer and scientific wiz who, after witnessing her nutty dad's dastardly deeds, defects to join our Moonbase Alpha heroes. \"Journey to Where\" (Episode 29) finds Koenig (Landau) and Helena (costar Barbara Bain) returning to Earth--specifically, and bizarrely, 14th-century Scotland--while \"One Moment of Humanity\" (Episode 27) sees the evil Zamara (Billie Whitelaw) and her android cronies trying to learn the violent ways of humans. Intriguing ideas, occasionally rather lame execution. In other words, there's plenty here to justify the points of view of the show's adherents and its detractors.DVD bonus features include production stills, TV promotional spots, and interactive menus.

{"description": "Starring Anthony Quinn in the title role,Barabbaswas released in 1961 in the midst of a wave of widescreen epics based on biblical characters. The screenplay, by playwright Christopher Fry (who also contributed toBen-Hur), is an unusually intelligent one. Further assets are the imaginative, sparingly orchestrated score by Mario Nascimbene and a handsome production design by art director Mario Chiari that is so rewarding to the eye in Aldo Tonti's often dazzling cinematography.Many scenes, such as Christ's crucifixion, are shot and staged like tableaux in a style reminiscent of the great masters of art. And director Richard Fleischer surpasses anything Ridley Scott achieved years later inGladiator: he fills the huge arena--a vast Roman amphitheatre--with a gladiatorial school of hand-to-hand combat, a parade of elephants, and a den of lions, and then caps his production with a riveting and thrillingly mounted duel between Jack Palance, careering round the circumference of the arena in his chariot, and Barabbas dodging him on foot.--Adrian Edwards", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001NSLE5I", "B000056AXZ", "B00005JN8Z", "B0002BO05S", "B000CNE0M4", "B00ALTQRUC", "B002AT8KBU", "B0074JOUHE", "0783226039", "B00125WAXM", "B0006GANX2", "B00005QJJG", "B000CNE0JW", "B00AEBBACM", "B00014K5V4", "B0000633QW", "B00AMSM9CW", "B00DC6YEAQ", "B0010YSDAE", "B001DZOCY6", "B004H0M31I", "B001ECQ6E2", "B001NSLE4Y", "B00D24COPU", "B003A6X166", "B003A6WZXG", "B000056HP5", "B00009KYDL", "B0036APHNG", "B00D6I7DEE", "B002Z2X7GU", "B008FYZI6E", "B001GH3CL0", "B0006J28K0", "B004GJYR8W", "B000WMFZMY", "B000V3L1M2", "B000E1MXT6", "B00022LIHU", "067972544X", "B0009WFF8Q", "B0007VY404", "1563713942", "B000YDMPBU", "B006MWA96K", "B0006Q93ZG", "1450700551", "B0007VY3ZU", "B00008LDO7", "B00005LKHN", "B00HFWETSA", "B0006J28KA", "B002Z2X7GK", "B002T7X4UK", "B00J2F6CTC", "B000063UQP", "B00HRYH6GI", "B00008J2PG", "B000062XF2", "B000LPR6GA", "B00007G1WH", "B0006B2A6U", "B00006AUGK", "B0034C0GRS", "B000034DE2", "B000E1MXTG", "B0014BQR24", "B00I5EONJC", "B0009WFF68", "B004RUF9DC", "B000AQ6A0I", "B0009WFF9K", "B0037JO0X4", "B00028HBKM", "B00H7BJ128", "B0001NBMDK", "B0074JOW5Y", "B000E8JO32", "B000M9BPG2", "B000066C6H", "B000FFJ83K", "B004AOKPMA", "B000095WW6", "B00BF657ZQ", "B0001NBMEE", "B00J2F6B7A", "B0002J58JM", "B00ICWO144", "B0002VEU4O", "B006TTC5MM", "B0018LX9RG", "1450700543", "B00CLF80KE", "B00108FMFO", "B004C39E26", "B004L3ARS2", "B0002KPHW4", "B00BQ7GU1Y", "B004KZH5LI", "B0000CBXYU"], "bought_together": ["B001NSLE5I", "B000056AXZ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001NSLE5I", "B00005JN8Z", "B0074JOUHE", "B0002BO05S"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 75129}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.49, "brand": "QUINN,ANTHONY", "asin": "B00005V1WY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51gZPLtFDNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Barabbas"}

{"description": "\"A Simpson on a T-shirt. I never thought I'd see the day.\" So remarks Marge Simpson in \"Dancin' Homer,\" just one of 22 mostly classic episodes that comprise this series' brilliant second season.The Simpsonsby that time was already a pop culture phenomenon, but instead of suffering a sophomore slump, this iconoclastic animated series was just hitting its stride. Series milestones include: first Oscar&#xAE;-winning guest voice (an unbilled Dustin Hoffman in \"Lisa's Substitute\"), first Beatle guest voice (Ringo in \"Brush with Greatness\"), first \"Treehouse of Horror\" Halloween episode, first flashback episode (\"The Way We Was,\" in which Homer meets Marge), and the first episode to make me cry (Bart's last frolic with obedience school washout Santa's Little Helper in \"Bart's Dog Gets an F\"). It's in this season theThe Simpsonsreally finds its voice. The writing is sharper, and the upending of sitcom convention more subversive. \"Perhaps there is no moral to this story,\" observes Lisa at the end of \"Blood Feud.\" \"Exactly,\" agrees Homer. \"Just a bunch of stuff that happens.\"In the first season, Bart was the series' breakout star, but in the second,The Simpsonsestablished itself as a true ensemble series. Each character came into their own with career-best episodes. Marge, the family's long-suffering voice of reason, crusades against cartoon violence in \"Itchy & Scratchy & Marge.\" Lisa, the heart and tortured soul of the series, develops an ill-fated crush on her new teacher in \"Lisa's Substitute.\" Bart desperately tries to raise the money to buy Radioactive Man No. 1 in \"Three Men and a Comic Book.\" Homer's stock rises when he grows hair in \"Simpson and Delilah.\" Joining theSimpsonsroster of scene-stealing supporting characters are Dr. Hibbert (\"Bart the Daredevil\"), shyster lawyer Lionel Hutz (voiced by the late, great Phil Hartman in \"Bart Gets Hit by a Car\"), the Ahnold-esque action hero McBain (\"The Way We Was\"), slobbering aliens Kang and Kodos (\"Treehouse of Horror\"), and \"nutty professor\" Frink (\"Old Money\").

{"description": "A string of insurmountable gaps in logic keeps this science fiction/thriller hybrid from director John Dahl (Joy Ride,The Last Seduction) from fully developing its intriguing premise. Ray Liotta stars as a medical examiner who is obsessed with finding his wife's killer. A possible solution is found in neurobiologist Linda Fiorentino's experimental serum, which transfers memories from one person to another--even from the deceased. Liotta injects himself with the serum, which allows him harrowing glimpses into other people's minds. But while each dose brings him closer to identifying the killer, it also puts him one step nearer to death. Dahl keeps the film moving briskly and wraps it in noirish photography, but he's let down by Bill Geddie's script, which asks viewers to swallow some implausible notions (the instantaneous success of the experimental serum, for one).--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006L91I", "B00000FZL2", "B00AEFYD2M", "B00008YJDK", "6305173966", "B00004ZBVM", "B00005UQ9T", "1573628972", "B00596WFE4", "0792844874", "6305310335", "6305308837", "B00441GZ00", "B00005ONLF", "B003A12WBQ", "0783110871", "B000FOPPD8", "6304698747", "B000UAE7KO", "B000BBOUW2", "B000U1ZV76", "B0000VJG72", "B000E5N684", "0783225520", "B001UDS4BS", "B000RW5BYG", "B001EAWMGA", "6305161933", "B003AWRMA6", "B00LJGVA1W", "B00151QYXU", "B00005UQ9I", "B0043X1FNQ", "B00008DDVT", "B00000GHZK", "B00008L3S6", "B000I2J736", "B004IFYMWK", "B00D5XC8PE", "B0009FU0ZG", "B00EZ50SGW", "B001NY4WYC", "B00000JSJC", "0767807588", "B001R3YRG2", "B00AEFY6PQ", "0790732149", "B00CHMBQRA", "0783230060", "B00G7QPUII", "B007IJKQRS", "B00BN3ED8I", "B000H5TH1Q", "B0011VIO3M", "B000063JDG", "630530887X", "B008JFUN50", "B0074JOU8I", "B000FS9UKI", "B001DSNEJM", "B00AEBB8O2", "B000RW5BZ0", "0792846435", "6305213283", "B0024FADBA", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B007UW9WMS", "B00009AOBK", "B003AWRMC4", "0783222149", "6301971345", "B004D2GMVM", "B00BOXZAJ8", "B0047T74CM", "B000R4SMCW", "B000Y7U97I", "B00006AUIG", "B00I4581F4", "B002VWNICC", "B002LK3DZQ", "0783226888", "B000063JDE", "6305213305", "B009R8Q8Y8", "B00003CXSP", "B00005PJ8T", "B00ECW9UJY", "B00005BCKF", "B005OK0YRK", "B000077VRH", "B000056VOZ", "B00003CXZ4", "B000A2UBN4", "B000035P5A", "B00008CMRK", "B00562I40K", "B00008L3U6", "B00AEFYD9K", "B003AWRM9W", "B002O3Z4ZW"], "bought_together": ["B00006L91I", "B00AEFYD2M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00CD45JBG", "B00006L91I", "B00AEFYD2M", "B00008YJDK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 40959}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.08, "brand": "LIOTTA,RAY", "asin": "B000063JDO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41MT7R8X0ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Unforgettable"}

{"description": "Complete Set This series ran from 1975 to 1977 and is considered by many sci-fi aficionados to be the ultimate in the genre, even surpassing Star Trek. Yet another example of the outrageous imagination and technical wizardry of Gerry Anderson (Thunderbirds). On September of the title year, a massive explosion at a lunar waste dump blasts the Moon out of the Earth's orbit, launching the crew of Moonbase Alpha into the back of the beyond.

There's nothing fancy about the plot--the soldiers hole up in a farmhouse  and desperately try to fend off the werewolves until dawn--but the script  is full of smart dialogue and clever ideas, the direction is dynamic, and  the performances (from Kevin McKidd, Sean Pertwee, Emma Cleasby, and Liam  Cunningham, among a solid cast of relative unknowns) are strong and  committed throughout.Dog Soldierspays homage toNight of the  Living Dead,Aliens, andThe Evil Dead, among other  films, but the references are woven into the fabric of the movie.

{"description": "The third season of Joss Whedon'sBuffy the Vampire Slayerwas marked by the arrival in Sunnydale of renegade slayer Faith (Eliza Dushku), a moody loner who seemed to like her demon-staking calling just a littletoomuch. While Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) was always wary of Faith, the two developed a deep friendship and appreciative rapport--that is, until the evil mayor of Sunnydale (Harry Groener) tapped into Faith's dark side and lured her into his plot to take over the world, first as a double agent spying on Buffy, then as out-and-out nemesis. And as the mayor's ascension approached--which happened to fall on Sunnydale High's graduation day--Buffy and Faith's battles got nastier and nastier, as Buffy attempted to wrestle with her dark side (literally and figuratively), save the world and her friends, and keep her lover Angel (David Boreanaz) out of Faith's evil clutches.Chock-full of exceptional episodes, this third season started out with a bang (the superb season opener \"Anne,\" in which a runaway Buffy finally returns to her Slayer calling) and never let up. Among other highlights, the season introduced former vengeance demon and soon-to-be regular Anya (Emma Caulfield), fleshed out Angel's tortured character (and readied him for his own series), and featured a hilarious doppelganger Willow (Alyson Hannigan), a vampire from a parallel universe, who in Willow's own words was \"evil and... skanky... and kinda gay!\" (Total foreshadowing there, folks.) The season's pi&#xE8;ce de r&#xE9;sistance, though, was the two-parter \"Graduation Day,\" wherein Faith tries to kill Angel, and the students of Sunnydale High prepare to do battle with a mutated mayor and his army of demons. Aside from the series' exceptional writing and acting, this compelling year ofBuffywas anchored by the consistently excellent Gellar, as well as Dushku's complicated Faith, a girl youtrulylove to hate. By the time you finish these episodes, Faith will have cast a spell on you that you'll find very hard to shake.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVM8", "B000EHSVKK", "B000EHSVMS", "B000EHSVN2", "B000I0QLQY", "B000I0QLR8", "B000I0QLRI", "B000I0QLRS", "B000I0QLS2", "B007H9CNOI", "B0006IUE16", "B000HD1482", "B0009W5J4Q", "B000B5XOW0", "B000CCBCGM", "B000ERVJM2", "B000GG4Y6O", "B000JLTRIG", "B000OIOPHC", "B003YF9Q08", "B00344EAQO", "B0000AQS0F", "1593078226", "B00466H3CW", "B005CM1IIE", "B00005JLKB", "1595821651", "B002JVWR4U", "B00JF5G8WU", "B006LG74Q0", "B0024FAR66", "B0001JXPPC", "B00J2T1856", "B00022FWEU", "B00006J3WH", "B0009JE6FC", "B00IKM5LXG", "B00001R3O1", "B000069I1I", "B000CNE0SS", "B000BNI90Y", "B001JAHRME", "1595826106", "B00AMDA2QC", "1442412097", "1595825584", "B00005Y1NF", "159307963X", "B0012Z36F8", "B000X5SPBI", "B003L77GAQ", "B000CNE0TC", "B00133QNS6", "B000EBGFPY", "B001FB4W0C", "B002U8XW9Q", "B001QE99AQ", "B000N6SE4U", "B003R4ZMN6", "0789326302", "B000BOH986", "B009LDCXNY", "B001M5UDGS", "1442412119", "B0018RKEQY", "B000NOKFH6", "B00511N79O", "B002BWP2IK", "B000MX7V66", "B000062XFG", "B00006FD9N", "B00JF5GAZA", "B00133QNSG", "B009LDCWWG", "B00133QNRW", "B000E5KQM8", "B000F3UAE8", "B000FL7CAK", "B000B8QFYG", "B003L77GWE", "B00EIL7E9C", "B00B1RB7TO", "B00191AEYQ", "B0030Y12AA", "B0011FLGZQ", "B000AJJNI6", "B001ILFUA0", "B001MVWRNE", "B000095ZGW", "B000RW3YYA", "B00K0D9760", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B000NA28I4", "B000LC4ZI0", "B000BOH98G", "B000AJJNFE", "B000O77SN6", "B00005JLYW"], "bought_together": ["B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVM8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVKK", "B0046XG48O", "B000EHSVLY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 154783}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 32.59, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B00006RCNX", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RSRJ6FCWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Third Season"}

This should have been another classic Western pairing James Stewart with director Anthony Mann.  But after choosing the locations, cast, and crew, and directing the precredit sequence, Mann abruptly resigned.  He found Borden Chase's screenplay an \"incoherent\" rehash of relationships and setups from their previous films, nor was he encouraged by Stewart's determination to play the accordion and sing.  Stewart's an ex-railroad cop who became a pariah by letting a prisoner--Audie Murphy's \"The Utica Kid\"--escape.  The two cross paths again in a ghost town where Dan Duryea, doing a zany version of his loony outlaw fromWinchester '73, has holed up with his gang.

{"description": "Connoisseurs of political chicanery will relishHouse of Cards, the mordantly funny story of Francis Urquhart (Ian Richardson), a British politician with his eye on the top job. Urquhart is the chief whip of the Conservative Party and his job is to maintain party discipline, or, as he likes to say, \"put a bit of stick about.\" This means that he has intimate knowledge of his colleagues' foibles, knowledge that he uses to further his own political ambitions. Aided by his equally ruthless wife and drawing on a network of accomplices, Urquhart forces the prime minister to resign then sets out to discredit each of his rivals for the party leadership. Although it is strongly cast throughout,House of Cardsbelongs to Ian Richardson. Without his perfectly balanced performance, Urquhart might have become no more than a two-dimensional villain, but Richardson finds exactly the right tone to make his character as attractive as he is wicked. Thanks to Richardson, and a superb script by Andrew Davies, this brilliant political satire is sure to delight anyone who has wondered what might be going on in the darker corners of our democratic institutions.InTo Play the King, Urquhart appears to have everything he wants. He is the prime minister, he has no immediate rivals, and everyone who knows of his crimes is either on his side or dead. But a new challenge arises when the queen dies and the new king (Michael Kitchen doing a perfect Prince Charles) proves to be a thorn in Urquhart's side. Urquhart may be a staunch defender of the monarchy as a concept, but an individual sovereign is fair game if he proves to be a threat. With a Davies script that pokes fun at British politics and the antics of the royal family as well as a terrific cast led again by Ian Richardson,To Play the Kingmaintains the high standard set byHouse of Cards.The Final Cut, the last installment of the trilogy, strikes a more somber note than its predecessors. Urquhart has almost overtaken Margaret Thatcher to become Britain's longest serving postwar leader, but the public is tiring of him and there are rumblings of dissent in the Conservative Party. Urquhart and his wife plot to secure both their place in history and their financial future. Once again, writer Andrew Davies has created a satire to relish, one that confirms all of our doubts about the motives of politicians. Ian Richardson's wonderful performance--filled with sly asides and winks to the camera--makes Francis Urquhart as fascinating as he is wicked, and we find ourselves rooting for this terrible man. The world would certainly be a duller place without him.--Simon Leake", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00J5LXT44", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B000YRY8BG", "B0011VJRVU", "B008RO6PJQ", "B00HW3EXCE", "1492606677", "1492606618", "1492606642", "B00HGE90Z4", "B00JJRLFTU", "B00KHWSB5M", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B005DXCO94", "B00C888LOO", "B00HUCF420", "B005DXCOKS", "B00BCXW106", "B00ANGICCO", "B009DS6YGO", "B00H4ZEFTQ", "B00F1BFRA6", "B001VLBDB2", "B00ECGHM5O", "B004132HZS", "B000742FZW", "B00JJRLG7G", "B00B5A9FNM", "B00EUI4XHE", "B006JY3OHW", "B00HV2BG44", "0002242796", "B00FGEO9NE", "B004QOB8SO", "B00GAHJO8G", "B00BQXTCVS", "B00D49YDDY", "B00FZ2NTOM", "B00DQN6IOK", "B004X1VUNI", "B000KF0DVQ", "B00BVMXBDO", "B00E3UN44W", "B00B83OIVA", "B003X82D1K", "B00FEP9MYG", "B001JXPC6O", "B00J5LXSOA", "B00DJYJT5Q", "B00KHA99BY", "B00FCOTRV2", "B008FTWT7K", "B00HI4EGQA", "B003ZZRC9O", "B007T40GRW", "B00EBBGKTE", "B005K8QIS0", "B000062XDX", "B005GP7EVC", "B006X202AM", "B00HUCF7AO", "B00A27O5AW", "B008SBXFUU", "B0028AEO0M", "B00JJRLFVS", "B00GWXI1F0", "B00HUAH14Q", "B0012E2F60", "B00GWXI2RM", "B00F988AV4", "B00CYQXGMW", "B0059XTTW8", "B00EIXWW2O", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B0092QH902", "B00915G6R6", "B008N8A3DA", "B00BUUAV08", "B00HYZ0ZLS", "B00ANGICPG", "B000HC2LI0", "B00D49YE4W", "B00CU55HMY", "B00IWULQQ2", "B00GWXI2MC", "B00GWXI28Q", "B00GD7UO4G", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00GWXI16O", "B00IYMSMTM", "B00BWX4MDU", "B00JQF7ZR6", "B00HUAGYF8", "B00E3HDW3I", "B009M7PR5A", "B0075FF5QM", "B00005JKNF", "B00KIZY3XW", "B00DL48BM6"], "bought_together": ["B00J5LXT44", "B00BC5I6Q2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BC5I6Q2", "B00J5LXT44", "B00HW3EXCE", "B00HUCF420"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 46243}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 30.09, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B00009MGGI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41cpGn3vZUL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "House of Cards Trilogy (House of Cards / To Play the King / The Final Cut)"}

After breakfast the next morning, Dexter is transformed, possessing a superhuman strength that levels lampposts and destroys doorknobs. The powerful formula comes to the attention of the college dean and two rival cereal companies, touching off a hilarious chain of events. Ultimate control of the moneymaking formula rides on a weight lifting match between the pitifully small Medfield team and the superior State challengers.

{"description": "TheAlien Quadrilogyis a nine-disc boxed set devoted to the fourAlienfilms. Although previously available on DVD as theAlien Legacy, here they have been repackaged with vastly more extras and with upgraded sound and picture. For anyone who hasn't been in hypersleep for the last 25 years, this series needs no introduction, though for the first time each film now comes in both original and \"special edition\" form.Alien(1979) was so perfect it didn't need fixing, and Ridley Scott's 2003 director's cut is fiddling for the sake of fiddling. Watch it once, then return to the majestic, perfectly paced original. Conversely, the special edition of James Cameron'sAliens(1986) is the definitive version, though it's nice to finally have the theatrical cut on DVD for comparison. Most interesting is the alternativeAlien 3(1992). This isn't a \"director's cut\"--David Fincher refused to have any involvement with this release--but a 1991 work-print that runs 29 minutes longer than the theatrical version, and has now been restored, remastered, and finished off with (unfortunately) cheap new CGI. Still, it's truly fascinating, offering a different insight into a flawed masterpiece. The expanded opening is visually breathtaking, the central firestorm is much longer, and a subplot involving Paul McGann's character adds considerable depth to story. The ending is also subtly but significantly different.Alien: Resurrection(1997) always was a mess with a handful of brilliant scenes, and the special edition just makes it eight minutes longer.TheAlien Quadrilogyoffers the first and fourth films with DTS soundtracks, the others having still fine Dolby Digital 5.1 presentation. All four films sound fantastic, with much low-level detail revealed for the first time. Each is anamorphically enhanced at the correct original aspect ratio, and the prints and transfers are superlative. Every film offers a commentary track that lends insight into the creative process--though the Scott-only commentary and isolated music score from the firstAlienDVD release are missing here.Each movie is complemented by a separate disc packed with hours of seriously detailed documentaries (all presented in full-screen with clips letterboxed), thousands of photos, production stills, and storyboards, giving a level of inside information for the dedicated buff only surpassed by theLord of the Ringsextended DVD sets. A ninth DVD compiles miscellaneous material, including an hourlong documentary and even all the extras from the oldAlienlaserdisc. \"Exhaustive\" hardly beings to describe theAlien Quadrilogy, a set that establishes the new DVD benchmark for retrospective releases and looks unlikely to be surpassed for some time.--Gary S.

{"description": "Based on Brian Greene'sbook, this three-part Nova program should do for physics whatCosmosdid for astronomy. Greene hosts the program on the relative new concept of String Theory, a potential (and explosive) answer to the Holy Grail of science: a single, ultimate theory for everything. Part of Greene's (along with filmmakers Julia Cort and Joseph McMaster) genius is the ability to explain complex issues with ease thanks to a generous helping of graphics and humor. It starts with a perplexing anecdote: Einstein died trying to figure out if there could be an ultimate theory. His General Theory of Relativity brought order to the laws of large objects, but could not explain the chancier world of Quantum Mechanics (which deals with atomic particles). String Theory tries to marry the two. Greene and many colleagues give us a history of the quest and how String Theory was \"discovered\" in the 1980s. The formula has a lot of quirks, the most dazzling being the insistence there's 11 dimensions in the universe. Greene is not as natural asCosmoscreator/host Carl Sagan, but he is certainly friendly and encouraging (albeit it's quite odd for the host to be interviewed at various times in the program). Because it's a three-part show, there is some overlap at the start of hours 2 and 3.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0056031LE", "B004QSQMG8", "B0056031FA", "B000BKDO6G", "B0001WTWPG", "B008BJTQ0W", "B0047HXMMU", "B006WY0VRU", "B001IBCS3C", "B0015LPRPG", "B0002ABU2U", "B008IG0FEY", "B0047HXMKM", "B005F0TH2C", "B007IUEE8O", "B00FOLGW5C", "B003QWVPGW", "B000GIXLLG", "039333810X", "B000BKDNY4", "B0001WTULW", "B00652U6EW", "B000C8STO4", "B00465I1AG", "B00465I1A6", "B00BCV3IN2", "B004AR4WIK", "B00331RHEU", "B000BITUD4", "B0077PBPXM", "B00A3THVKK", "B005QW98IW", "B00IXPQUE4", "B004FOPFFC", "B000LP6KQW", "B000JJ5F8O", "B0028ERBSA", "B00IN69MWK", "B004XKVPLG", "B004D7SBMU", "B000MZGN54", "B00F1BFMBU", "B006QVRUY6", "B002XNEIIM", "B0001WTUM6", "0393058581", "B004HJ0ZMI", "0375727205", "0307278123", "B001JXPC1O", "B000XBPDYY", "B000055ZOB", "B000UP881S", "B00IWULQQ2", "B004K4FUWU", "B006QVRVYA", "B00IWULSTC", "B005KLOPLO", "B000VWZ0LG", "B00HNR3ZF0", "B007IUEDLW", "B0016OKQOO", "B00FNPQW7M", "0691156271", "B004XKVQVU", "B0031SZER2", "B003NF97OE", "B001N77YRG", "B000EOTENQ", "B005BYBZEK", "B00AK51Q8U", "B001D7T460", "0375412883", "B00IN69Q9O", "B004CYVZ18", "B001UW59JY", "B000C8STOE", "0307265633", "B001MYIQKO", "B001IBCS2S", "1400033721", "B007IUEDW6", "B004PYDN4M", "047046724X", "B0000648XV", "B00363WGHI", "B00AK51NJC", "B001J863EO", "B00BQI49VG", "B005JYNG9Y", "B00BCV3JKE", "B0030BS1FM", "B004D7SBLQ", "B009SYUUPO", "B00AK51OFK", "B005KLOPGY", "1886653364", "B000PY510K", "B0042EJDJ4", "B00BQI43E4"], "bought_together": ["B0056031LE", "B004QSQMG8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008BJTQ0W", "B004QSQMG8", "B0056031LE", "B0047HXMMU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 20246}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 15.9, "brand": "WGBH BOSTON VIDEO", "asin": "B0000ZG0TA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/414PG1K98AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "NOVA - The Elegant Universe"}

Although there's still no Wachowski brothers talking about their creation, there's a lot of good stuff here in the three main segments. We are constantly reminded how long the back-to-back filming schedule was, and it's most interesting to hear from the actors and artists as they come to the end of this long road. When a white rabbit flashes on screen, you can \"branch\" the most interesting documentary footage: how \"bullet time\" is being recalibrated and how you go about replicating so many Agent Smiths. A timeline is wonderfully put together, but cumbersome to navigate through.

{"description": "Charlie's Angels: The Complete Second Seasonhas no shortage of the good-natured cheese and eye candy that made the primetime television show'sdebut seasonwildly popular in 1976. The Angels had a new look in their second year: Farrah Fawcett, arguably the most popular of the show's three actresses, departed before the sophomore season and was replaced by another blonde dazzler, Cheryl Ladd. (Ladd's character, Kris Munroe, was the younger sister of Fawcett's Jill Munroe, whose exit is explained in the premiere episode as a liberated woman's career move: Jill has decided to race cars in Spain.)No sooner does Kris settle in than a crisis sweeps through off-screen Charlie's private investigation agency. While cavorting on Oahu in the two-part \"Angels in Paradise,\" Charlie is kidnapped by a smuggler (France Nuyen), who demands the Angels break her husband out of jail in exchange for their boss's life. Bubbly Kris, brainy Sabrina Duncan (Kate Jackson), beauteous Kelly Garrett (Jaclyn Smith), and sidekick Bosley (David Doyle) are compelled to soak up rays and sip fruity mixed drinks in Waikiki while fighting crime in various guises, re-establishing, for another season,Charlie's Angels' dramatic and aesthetic game plan for every episode: start slow with lots of idle chatter, put the girls in a ridiculous undercover situation, and get them out of their clothes as much as possible.The pattern continues in the silly \"Angels on Ice,\" starring old hands Phil Silvers and Jim Backus, in which our heroines join an ice show to find out who kidnapped a pair of skaters. \"Pretty Angels All in a Row\" finds Kelly and Kris reluctant entrants in a \"Miss Chrysanthemum Pageant\" (no, you won't find Kate Jackson in a swimsuit this year, either) rigged by organized crime. \"Circus of Terror,\" co-starring James Darren, enlists the Angels in the carney life. If there is anything to complain about regarding season 2, it is that the novelty ofCharlie's Angelshas worn a little thin, and every episode feels the same. Still, there are surprises: \"The Sammy Davis Jr. Kidnap Caper\" stars the late rat-packer in peril and much bemused by the presence of three comely bodyguards.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FDFSH2", "B00008WJEZ", "B0028RABR0", "B00AIA884W", "B003W5C0TY", "B00GOC750Q", "B005EVY8NA", "B004M9ZI0C", "B00080ZG2E", "B0018O5WTQ", "B000ASDFIG", "B000B8IA3U", "B005LFQRTC", "B00023GGAI", "B000Z6GT18", "B0007Y8AYC", "B008OR5X6M", "B0006Z2KZ2", "B00018D3RI", "B00AA8Q0JM", "B000GRU09I", "B003L77FWA", "B00A4Y62JU", "B00KTZALDC", "B000HEVZ7Q", "B00DYQ1GBE", "B00005JOJR", "B00HZMZ286", "B0001ZMWYG", "B00005JO4F", "B000NQRV8U", "B000E1EHPY", "B007KW5M6I", "B001HUHBC2", "B00GLPYVT4", "B00HW3L9MG", "B0014FAIXE", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B003L77FWU", "B000HIVIOC", "B00008EYBH", "B002WQ79A4", "B0014FAIYS", "B00005JO3P", "B000QUEQ68", "B00803LRK6", "B000E5KQM8", "B0002Y4T7O", "B000UX6TL6", "B0030VANIU", "B00005JLYW", "B001675ZJM", "B000CELOW2", "B0007WQHFS", "B001E6JC1M", "B009L0NC82", "B000EQ45BU", "B000ASDFIQ", "B000PMGS5E", "B00008YLVB", "B000BGR1B4", "B00G3BRC24", "B0007CNY54", "B00GOC75V0", "B000BF0C8E", "B00005JNHU", "B00GLT2SOA", "B000BUE5D2", "B000NOIX66", "B0007WFXL2", "B000PGTPC8", "B00280QNKG", "B000RZIGSQ", "B005TTEG5W", "B0014VPFKY", "B001BN4WLS", "B00ALTQRNO", "B003BGZ61S", "B000GW8UAE", "B0077T5SOA", "B000A0GORS", "B0012EM5E2", "B000E3L7FK", "B002XKKX8E", "B001DHXT7U", "B000E5KQLY", "B0009I7NH6", "B0007V6IWQ", "B000LE16VC", "B0012EM5EW", "B00008EY6N", "B0007IO6V4", "B003BGZ60Y", "B004X1M3DE", "B000O77SNG", "B000DZ95IU", "B00I458456", "B001675ZJW"], "bought_together": ["B000FDFSH2", "B00008WJEZ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008H6GHII", "B00008WJEZ", "B0028RABR0", "B00GOC750Q"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 41873}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 8.74, "brand": "Columbia Tri Star", "asin": "B0001BS3IE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SmYm7t0sL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Charlie's Angels: Season 2"}
{"description": "Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce star in this 1939 adaptation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's frequently filmed novel, and the result is one of the most atmospheric and purely enjoyable versions ofThe Hound of the Baskervilles. Except for minor changes, the script is true to Doyle's enthralling mystery about a centuries-long curse against heirs to the Baskerville estate, situated within the haunting and deadly Dartmoor in the southwest of England. With the arrival of a new master, Canadian Henry Baskerville (Richard Greene), Sherlock Holmes (Rathbone) and Dr. Watson (Bruce) are called upon to solve the strange case of the \"gigantic hound\" that may be readying to savage the poor fellow. Wonderful sets, crisp performances, and Rathbone's accessible but no-nonsense take on the Great Detective make this a real delight.

{"description": "No actor works harder to open a movie than Tom Cruise. His enthusiasm is throughout the DVD extras as he mirrors his samurai character by constantly talking about \"loyalty\" and \"discipline\" while working on the film. However as a post-movie experience, the top-line extras with Cruise and director Edward Zwick are repetitive and underwhelming, with too many clips from the film we assume DVD viewers have just seen. The History Channel show is also a pre-release promotional device that misses an opportunity to really dig into this intriguing time period. Better are segments on the costumes, the production design, and how you put together an Imperial army--in New Zealand, no less. Zwick's low-key and dense commentary (plus a \"Video Journal\") is not vital, but he illustrates many of the little peculiarities it took to make the wide-ranging film come together. There are two deleted scenes; a samurai's first appearance is particularly memorable.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFY5B6", "B002O3Z50Q", "B00004XPPG", "B00AMSLDTM", "B0002YLCG0", "B0000DZTIW", "B000AARKOO", "B000QXDED6", "B003U0AHBO", "B00AEFXKUI", "B000A2WP7O", "B008MIMWOY", "B00AEBBA36", "B004AOECXI", "6305692688", "B000MGB6NM", "B0000TANUI", "079283366X", "B00005JL78", "B000W1SZBS", "B004SIP88Y", "B0034G4P58", "B001TUZG4K", "B00AS1Q93S", "B000MRA592", "B00001ZWUS", "B000E5N6LG", "B000XR9L50", "B0001HLVS2", "B00HEPDGKA", "B003ASLJO0", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000P0J0EW", "B0000A2ZNX", "B00005JNTI", "B0018QPPXW", "B000065U1N", "B000095WW8", "B0002WZTOI", "B002VWNIEA", "B004U7MQWY", "B002VWNID6", "B008JFUO36", "B00AEBB86A", "B00005JN0W", "B0007Q6VXC", "B001LRJH0U", "B000MZHW40", "B0002IQMAM", "B00004WG2F", "B003INBO3I", "B000EHRVMY", "B000NOKFHQ", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEFXVCU", "B000YENUI6", "B000M341QE", "B0000YEEGM", "B001680M26", "B008R65XYC", "B002ZG99QS", "B00008K76U", "B000HRMAPE", "B007TBKAXK", "B00000G3PA", "0767810856", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00AEFXYJA", "B002T9H2LA", "B000P0J0AG", "B00003CXZ1", "B000O599YO", "B000FS9FCG", "6304711905", "B00AEFXRRO", "B000HRMAUY", "B001ILHY1I", "B002NZK5V4", "B002VWNICC", "B000VKL6ZM", "B001UDS4BS", "B002ZG997C", "B004SIP8ZM", "0800177967", "B0001O3YD0", "B00005ATZT", "B004XFZ3UU", "B00004Z4WR", "B005LAIH2W", "B0007TKNGA", "B00000JQB5", "B0012Q732O", "B002ZG97RE", "B0002VEUV2", "0800141741", "B002ZG977Y", "B00005N5S3", "B00008G8M4", "B0000B1OFL"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFY5B6", "B00004XPPG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000QXDED6", "B00BEJL6JK", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00JU949TK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 121880}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 17.25, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001JXOUS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EdSWs9r9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Last Samurai (Full Screen Edition)"}

{"description": "As the triumphant start of a trilogy,The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ringleaves you begging for more. By necessity, Peter Jackson's ambitious epic compresses J.R.R. Tolkien's classicThe Lord of the Rings, but this robust adaptation maintains reverent allegiance to Tolkien's creation, instantly qualifying as one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. At 178 minutes, it's long enough to establish the myriad inhabitants of Middle-earth, the legendary Rings of Power, and the fellowship of hobbits, elves, dwarves, and humans--led by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the brave hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood)--who must battle terrifying forces of evil on their perilous journey to destroy the One Ring in the land of Mordor. Superbly paced, the film is both epic and intimate, offering astonishing special effects and production design while emphasizing the emotional intensity of Frodo's adventure, and ends on a perfect note of heroic loyalty and rich anticipation.After the breaking of the Fellowship, Frodo and Sam journey to Mordor with the creature Gollum as their guide inThe Two Towers. Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) join in the defense of the people of Rohan, who are the first target in the eradication of the race of Men by the renegade wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee) and the dark lord Sauron. Fantastic creatures, astounding visual effects, and a climactic battle at the fortress of Helm's Deep makeThe Two Towersa worthy successor toThe Fellowship of the Ring, grander in scale but retaining the story's emotional intimacy.WithThe Return of the King, the greatest fantasy epic in film history draws to a grand and glorious conclusion. The trilogy could never fully satisfy those who remain exclusively loyal to Tolkien's expansive literature, but as a showcase for physical and technical craftsmanship it is unsurpassed in pure scale and ambition, setting milestone after cinematic milestone as Frodo and Sam continue their mission to Mordor to destroy the soul-corrupting One Ring. While the heir to the kingdom of Men, Aragorn, endures the massive battle at Minas Tirith with the allegiance of Legolas, Gimli, and Gandalf, Frodo and Sam must survive the schizoid deceptions of Gollum, who remains utterly convincing as a hybrid of performance (by Andy Serkis) and subtly nuanced computer animation. Jackson and cowriters Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens have much ground to cover; that they do so with intense pacing and epic sweep is impressive enough, but by investing greater depth and consequence in the actions of fellow hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), they ensure thatThe Return of the Kingmaintains the trilogy's emphasis on intimate fellowship and remains faithful to Tolkien's overall vision. By ending theLOTRtrilogy with noble integrity and faith in the power of imaginative storytelling,The Return of the King, like its predecessors, will stand as an adventure for the ages.--Jeff Shannon and David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B005OCFGTO", "B001DJLD1M", "B001BYMX4A", "B009JBWOU0", "B00003CXCT", "B00005JPH2", "B001BRJZPW", "B000QXDED6", "B000E8M0VA", "B000VWYJ86", "B000HEVZ9E", "B005COPWZW", "B00005JKZY", "0345538374", "B001F12J0C", "B0057RCFQS", "B00003CWT6", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00003CXC5", "B000I0RQVI", "B0060FXDCG", "B0054OGQM8", "B004M1A21K", "B001DHXT20", "B008MIMWP8", "B008JFUO72", "B001VLFE7G", "B00G1BPIOU", "B002HWRYJE", "B000YGDNPO", "B000VBIGCW", "B00E9PMML2", "B004H83IM8", "B004EPZ08O", "B0015XHP4A", "B001E75QH0", "B0090SI56Y", "B000P0J0AQ", "B001VLBDD0", "B008JFUS0U", "B00IV2I7IQ", "B003PIUINS", "B000UR9T8C", "B000U7WV1Y", "B006VRRGNK", "B007D5E7C2", "0345518845", "B0049IHX2C", "B00AZMFJYA", "B0015I2RT8", "B004LWZWGA", "B002I9Z8I0", "B0001HLVS2", "B002VPE1AW", "B004LWZW42", "B00003CXZ4", "B00E5I2MCM", "B004EPYZU8", "B008JFURII", "B00003CXC3", "B005LAIH54", "6305313687", "B0084IG8TM", "B00000K3D4", "B001CK1D44", "B00AEFXDO6", "B002ZG999U", "B00E9PMMX0", "B0042U94UQ", "B00275EGWY", "B001KVZ6FW", "B003Q6D2B4", "B000J4P9P8", "B0001Z4OXS", "B00177YA1K", "B003UYUQZW", "B0019L770A", "B000E6ESEY", "B003AWRMCE", "B000HCO83Q", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B0083SBMBM", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00011CZRE", "079284646X", "B00008G8M5", "B002ZG97YM", "B002ZG980U", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000U1ZV8K", "B008UZA8FY", "B005LAIIMG", "B004EPZ084", "B003EYVXTG", "B00005JKZV", "B00447L4JG"], "bought_together": ["B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HWWUQWQ", "B00005JKZY", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00003CWT6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 72846}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 39.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001VL0K2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51z4rwl-jOL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "From the creators of the flamboyantly fabulousViva Variety(and when willthatbe released on DVD?) comesReno 911, Comedy Central's most arresting comedy series. Ride along with the cluelessly cracked squad of the Wahoe County Sheriff's Department, who cross the proverbial thin blue line with impunity. \"That's how we do it in Reno,\" exults Lt. Dangle (Thomas Lennon), after absent-mindedly rear-ending a car whose trunk pops open to reveal a cache of marijuana.Reno 911hasCops's gritty documentary feel, andPolice Squad's straight face in subverting cop show conventions. The hapless officers get no respect, not from the citizens they encounter, from their colleagues in the FBI, or even from themselves. Kerri Kenney-Silver's unfortunate Det. Wiegel is the squad's odd girl out. \"She's like a bad casserole\" is one of the more polite things said about her. In one episode, a misunderstanding leads to her being put under a suicide watch, and she so loves the attention, she doesn't bother to inform her brethren that she, in fact, did not try to kill herself. The forays into black comedy are about as subtle as a S.W.A.T. assault. In the first episode's opening moments, an officer answers a domestic disturbance call with guns blazing, only to discover it is a surprise birthday party for him.ButReno 911would have gotten old fast if it was justPolice Academy-style mishaps and slapstick. What elevates this from being a one-joke series are the intimately observed characters' quirks and personal dramas. Dangle has a penchant for short shorts, and, in the first episode at least, comely male traffic offenders. Dangle is not exactly Capt. Furillo (fromHill Street Blues) in the compassion department. When the squad learns that unwed Deputy C. Johnson (Wendy McLendon-Covey) is pregnant, he jokingly searches for a phone book when considering who the father might be. \"There's usually a phone book around here,\" he shrugs. \"It would have been funnier.\"  Comedy Central may be guilty of running these episodes into the ground, but forReno 911's devoted following, and for rookies to the force, this boxed set of commercial-free episodes, some commentary-enhanced, is just the ticket.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0008KLV96", "B000F48D14", "B000P5FH5S", "B0018BDDF4", "B0025X4PBK", "B000PISZ8Q", "B000K7UBXY", "B000RW3VDE", "B00018YCIM", "B000B5XOR0", "B0018RKEQE", "B001L1S1PS", "B000GPIPTM", "B003M3A89A", "B0001ZWLVU", "B00005JNEQ", "B008FRJDVC", "B000FZETJS", "B0006Q93CO", "B0002KPHVU", "B00AQ5UPRC", "B005S97V82", "B003SLEDL0", "B00INLE5K4", "B0001MZ7K0", "B006W93ELK", "B000E6ES9O", "B0000AQS89", "B000B5XOWU", "B007I1Q544", "B0002WZRTU", "B002N5N5NE", "B001EOQVA4", "B000AJJNI6", "B003L77GJM", "B000RBA6CO", "B0055CP9PO", "B00330WP6Q", "B0007CILMK", "B005LAII2Q", "B004MA1K1M", "B00005JKMN", "B00274SITW", "B0000CABL2", "B00006AUIH", "B0002WZRSG", "B00008YGRS", "B000VWX6SA", "B0001MZ7KA", "B0002NY8XA", "B0014WAAE4", "B003H0ZHLW", "B004V2S4QK", "B001B9LWME", "B0012KSUTA", "B009LA4MUE", "B002WC89WK", "B000G6BL88", "B0016MOV92", "B00AMSQBUI", "B000EBGFPY", "B00BI7ZAM2", "B001053088", "B004MLEYTG", "B000CQQID0", "B00023P49M", "B003L77GDI", "B0009VBTP0", "B00AB65T7W", "B00023P49C", "B008412UKA", "B001DPHDBU", "B00009KNU5", "B000O77SF4", "B000KWZ1PC", "B0007CILMA", "B00166UFSY", "B004P7CMOQ", "B00EP2SN58", "B002DPPH6W", "B002ZGW92E", "B000FEBWTE", "B000R7I3XC", "B00363WGBO", "B006T5HNYQ", "B003L77GE2", "B001VPJYZ0", "B000SINT4S", "B0024FAD9M", "6305428263", "B001RIZ7OI", "B0077PTX0E", "B003L77GTM", "B00BYNL8DU", "B00BTRKMNI", "B0019L0ACM", "B001G5T6GW", "B006CR2OD6", "B00AEFYPXY", "B000N3SU92"], "bought_together": ["B0008KLV96", "B000F48D14"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0008KLV96", "B000F48D14", "B0018BDDF4", "B0025X4PBK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 16396}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 7.3, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B0001XAODE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519KESBH78L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Reno 911 - The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "Millenniummarked the second major television series created by Chris Carter, who'd already made his name as the brains behindThe X-Files. And, like its predecessor, it shares a lot of the same themes--it's a crime thriller that gradually unfolds into a grand conspiracy involving the government and the fate of the entire world.Agent Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) is a former FBI agent who has transplanted his family from Washington, D.C. to Seattle, after suffering something of a breakdown. He's an expert criminal profiler--arguably the best, thanks to his ability to \"see\" into the minds of killers--and he fears for the safety of his wife and young daughter. In Seattle, he joins the mysterious Millennium Group, an agency of freelance crime-busters who investigate particularly brutal crimes. As a result,Millenniumis downright bleak viewing, as Black jumps from horrific slaying to horrific slaying. Moreover, there's a growing sense of unease about the workings of the Millennium Group, so that in typical Chris Carter fashion, you don't know who to trust. With its pre-Y2K angst and overwhelming darkness, as well as its general humorlessness,Millenniumhasn't dated as well asThe X-Files. Still, thanks to Carter's vision and Henriksen's compelling take on the tortured Black, it's difficult not to get hooked.--Ted Kord", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000667HBS", "B0009X76XW", "B0006UEVUE", "B000EXDS3E", "B000EXDS3Y", "B000BOH98G", "B000BOH986", "B000BOH990", "B000CNE0T2", "B000CNE0SS", "B000EXDS34", "B000CNE0TC", "B0007X7044", "B001FACH7S", "B000O77SMW", "B000FOPPBA", "B000ATQYXI", "1480277460", "B000AM6OQ2", "B0000AOX0A", "B001G7PSZI", "B00028HOMM", "B00JQYV0B4", "B0056GLNQI", "B00E0KWBAI", "B001MVWRMU", "B0081QF6Q8", "B005HMHPE0", "B0001O3YD0", "B0015ET3YO", "0060575913", "0143039911", "B004X60QE2", "B0006UEVTK", "B00022FWEU", "B0013DZNAA", "B00HUPC5X8", "B00005JM67", "B000BCCAEQ", "B000056BP1", "B00E5S2HGS", "0060083972", "B00FUABG1C", "B004YPED14", "B001MVWRN4", "B001RHGRTS", "B00BTFK01Y", "B00B5ARKC0", "6304698763", "0141182342", "B0009NZ2RE", "B0013ZGN9I", "B00062IDEW", "B001CY5N00", "B0000694XX", "B0007N1AM2", "B001MVWRNE", "B000N3T0EG", "B00004YC1W", "B000FJH5M2", "B000HT3P60", "B000EOTTS6", "B001MVWRNO", "B00008NV4G", "B0000AOX09", "B0053O8A46", "B00A8KJN8M", "B005S9EJ8W", "B000B5XOVQ", "B003UD7J26", "B001AZIRZO", "B005LAIHXQ", "B0002V7OI8", "B0009W5J4Q", "B0055SNHQG", "B002AS464Q", "B001715A92", "B0051GOB2G", "B000MV8ABS", "B00AATGDUC"], "bought_together": ["B000667HBS", "B0009X76XW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001CY5N00", "B0006UEVUE", "B000667HBS", "B001FACH7S"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 75357}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 20.65, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B000244E2O", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VH96EF60L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Millennium - The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "It's clear right from the opening episodes of its third season thatFarscapehas finally developed into a grown-up show. There's a new self-confidence and a new maturity here that's entirely welcome after the often wildly erratic tone of the second season. The production design and high-quality effects work remain true to the show's original quirky style, although both the look and the more adult-themed scripts have become progressively darker.Season 3 is the year when the Wormhole story arc takes precedence, as the interactions between John Crichton and his nemesis Scorpius become ever more complicated (involving various different clones, real or \"neural\", of both antagonists). It's also the year that some major characters die, new ones are introduced, and Crichton (well, one version of him anyway) and Aeryn finally consummate their relationship. Moya's crew endures a vertiginous emotional roller-coaster ride when powerful issues of love, loyalty, and sacrifice loom large. They must also face their sternest challenge yet as the series' biggest story arc reaches an explosive climax aboard Scorpius's Command Carrier. Anyone who has not followedFarscapeextremely closely from the very beginning of season 1 will be utterly baffled by the convoluted plotting and complex character interactions. But for fans, this is the show's most rewarding year.--Mark Walker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002GP7ZW8", "B002GP7ZVO", "B002GP7ZV4", "B0006FO9B0", "B00F6WXPSQ", "B00GHH9GPU", "B001DF681G", "B006LPHY6G", "B007AFC0W4", "B008R52LA2", "B005CXOG3W", "B006LPHY5C", "B000HEZEY6", "B0017MO10U", "B000F8O2OM", "B002BAW6FE", "B00GOT11EK", "B000PMFRTC", "B004TJ1H3C", "B00129W6LE", "B00402FGE4", "B000JLTRHW", "B000RW3YYA", "B0017MO11O", "B0010YSD7M", "B000F8O2P6", "B000F8O2OW", "B000BNI90Y", "B001HUWQEA", "B000LC4ZI0", "B000F8O2PQ", "B002BAW6FY", "B0048FUUAI", "B000F8O2Q0", "B002BAW6GI", "B002CLKP00", "B000B8IA2G", "6302020190", "B004HYW84G", "B004EXWGHY", "B00B5ARKC0", "B000F8O2PG", "B00243FQFA", "B000FOPPBA", "B000FJH5M2", "B003L77GWE", "B00061QJSK", "B000BOH986", "6303961614", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B002ZCY872", "B0009JE6FM", "B001AQO43M", "B005X4P3DC", "B00IWTVDUW", "B00F3L8P26", "B002BAW6H2", "B0051GOB2G", "B0024FAD9C", "B0029WLJHK", "B00029NMJ0", "B00022FWEU", "B00242KD1S", "B0053O8A46", "B001RHGRTS", "B00466H3A4", "B000BCCAEQ", "B000AJJNFE", "B003L77G2Y", "B0000AQS0F", "B0009JE6FC", "B000A6CLL0", "B000BW7QWW", "B002JVWRD6", "B002BWP2IK", "B000AOEMXC", "B005PPMHO2", "B00008KA5A", "B002BAW6GS", "B003H9LIRK", "B000BOH98G", "B0007TKH66", "B003ZFC9M4", "B002N5N5MK", "B00133QNS6", "B000T9OP7G", "B00AZMFJYA", "B0011FLGZQ", "B00133QNSG", "B008H1Q61G", "B002EL4RLQ", "B0042YZFYG", "B000I0QLRS", "B009LDD5XQ", "B00DPJEWD4", "B0057FGD3Q", "B000W4KT9G", "B004X60QE2", "B000CNE0T2"], "bought_together": ["B002GP7ZW8", "B0006FO9B0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0006FO9B0", "B00E688AZE", "B00GOT13FM", "B002GP7ZVO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 102445}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 26.99, "brand": "ADV Films", "asin": "B0002IQFG8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51A6NMH8KKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Farscape - The Complete Third Season"}

Peter O'Toole plays Octavius/Augustus, heir to his doomed uncle Julius Caesar's command of the far-flung Roman empire. Surviving an assassination attempt and struck by news of the death of his old friend and ally, Agrippa (Ken Duken), in the same day, Octavius waxes nostalgic about his youthful exploits in Caesar's army (Benjamin Sadler plays the young Augustus in flashbacks) and his unprepared immersion in the deadly politics of the Mark Antony (Massimo Ghini) era. More immediate are Octavius' problems trying to stave off conspiracies by his wife Livia (Charlotte Rampling) to set up the emperor's stepson, Tiberius (Michele Bevilacqua), as heir, and talk his dutiful daughter Julia (Vittoria Belvedere) into a marriage she doesn't want. Roger Young (Jesus) directs this highly watchable costume drama, and O'Toole's golden presence makes the ancient intrigues tragically human.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000AJJNLI", "B000A1OFZ0", "B0006OBPZY", "B00007AJF4", "B0002S93TO", "B003EYVXXW", "B00406UK7S", "B0002PYTB4", "B00005R23V", "B004H0M31I", "B000S0KYTE", "B004X1Z14C", "B00005JMH8", "B000VKL6ZM", "B00125WAXM", "B0034G4P58", "B006JY3OHW", "B00000JYWU", "B002NN7ETC", "B009GNI3HY", "B00004U12X", "B007K7IB9I", "B001DZOCY6", "B003VE9WOC", "B004IFYMXO", "B00005JN8Z", "B000A6T1ZE", "B0007XG4ZK", "B000MGB6NM", "B00GJT2OWS", "B000HWZ4AC", "B0007OCG5Q", "B0028RXXE8", "B000AARKOO", "B0009UVCR6", "B00CHMBQM0", "B000034DE2", "B00007G1WH", "B00GMV8GL6", "B000EHQUGC", "B0002VEU4O", "B00005V1WY", "B003A6X166", "B001FZQOOU", "B000BB1520", "0767827775", "B0000524FG", "B000OIOPPE", "B00000JS6F", "B0002YLCG0", "B004P2VQZC", "0783226039", "B0000B1A58", "B003X2P97G", "B000ML8XMO", "B000RF7XYO", "B00078XGP6", "B004XC5LQE", "B004JMSIWM", "B000GIXEIG", "B000GG4Y5A", "B00BYEWLIU", "B002Z2X7GK", "B004FGA2HQ", "0812970586", "B009XTF8NI", "B002AT8KBU", "B00005U8QM", "B001F34HT6", "B002O3Z50Q", "B000R9U3B0", "B000TGCR38", "B0001NBMEE", "1416592814", "B001DWNUCO", "B0023BZ64Y", "B00FFT19XS", "B001F0TT6A", "B004K6FS5W", "B0060MYK7G", "B00ALTQRUC", "B001GH3CL0", "B000056AXZ", "B00008AOTO", "B0041KT3P8", "B000LSAIYE", "B00007G1YP", "B0086IMN80", "B0009WFFHM", "B003WEAVZU", "B0002B15YM", "B00015HXEA", "B004FHCH8C", "B002DY9KQ6", "B004H4AD2U", "B00BTYJYR6", "B001NSLE5I", "B002DU39GW"], "bought_together": ["B000AJJNLI", "B0006OBPZY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000AJJNLI", "B0006OBPZY", "B00406UK7S", "B000S0KYTE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 158254}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 17.49, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0006D3HDI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R4GXFJZML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Augustus"}

Not a happy place, obviously, and it gets worse when both men realize that they've been chained and pitted against one another by an unseen but apparently omniscient maniac who's screwing with their psyches as payment for past sins. Director James Wan, who concocted this grimy distraction with screenwriter Whannell, has seenSevenand any number of other arty existential-psycho-cat-and-mouse thrillers, so he's providedSawwith a little flash, a little blood, and a lot of ways to distract you from the fact that it doesn't make a whole hell of a lot of sense. Wan and Whannell (who's not the most accomplished actor, either) pile on the plot twists, which after some initially novel ideas become increasingly juvenile.

{"description": "Richard Widmark never had better exercise for his Cagney-like bouncing-ball energy thanNight and the City, a classic film noir about a hustler's meteoric flame-out. Although acknowledged as one of the great noir pictures, it's actually set and shot in London, which gives an exotic, displaced novelty to the usual noir universe. Widmark's performance as Harry Fabian is a jibbering, wheedling, giggling tour de force, as Harry schemes his way to setting up a wrestling match and finally establishing himself as a \"somebody.\" Instead, he manages to irritate the underworld heavies (memorably, Herbert Lom and Francis L. Sullivan) whose fingers are already deeply into the criminal pie. Gene Tierney and Googie Withers are the women--one good, one bad--who witness Harry's descent. This was director Jules Dassin's final project for a Hollywood studio before the blacklist forced him out, and he packs the film with tortured camera angles and spidery noir shadows; the movie's a real visual clambake.Night and the Citywas remade, tiredly, with Robert De Niro in 1992.

{"description": "Considered lost for nearly 70 years, Victory of Faith is again available to viewing audiences. A key work in the evolution of National Socialist propaganda, it provides an ambitious record of the 1933 NS Party rally at Nuremberg. The film ran afoul of authorities, however, after the \"blood purge\" of 1934, which rendered Brownshirt leader Ernst Rohm, a central figure in of the 1933 rally, a non-person. Across Germany, references to Rohm were obliterated from the public record, and all prints of Victory of Faith were tracked down and destroyed. Until now, the film seemed little more than an intriguing postscript to Third Reich history. Though far from a masterwork, the film is a revelation on many counts, offering a fascinating first draft of the ideas and techniques Riefenstahl would pull off so powerfully in Truimph of the Will. In their contrasts, the two films shed much light on the early evolution of NS propaganda, its evocation of heroism and collective will! , its portrayal of the 'national people's community,' and its depiction of Hitler most of all. Where Triumph of the Will showed Hitler assupreme symbol and absolute master of the movement, the Hitler of Victory of Faith is still first among equals, a man with an unrulyforelock, a presence not yet wholly in command. Moreover, Victoryof Faith provides a revealing look at the NS movement in the firstblush of its 1933 triumphs. Here, the movement still bears themarks of its street-fighter origins; its rituals are often raw,lacking the orchestrated precision and theatrical grandeur weassociate with later stagecraft. In these and other ways, Victoryof Faith fills a gap in our understanding of the Third Reich,capturing the Hitler state at a pivotal stage in its earlydevelopment.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00BHLTIT0", "B0073KQWDE", "B0017ZGYR0", "B004RV70U6", "0199592322", "B000C6Y742", "B000Y1L0TK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009KDVHMS"]}, "price": 24.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 345292}, "asin": "B0007T0MZ2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51kJl3LJClL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Victory of Faith (Der Sieg des Glaubens)"}

{"description": "From Hollywood's legendary Cocoanut Grove to the pioneering conquest of the wild blue yonder, Martin Scorsese'sThe Aviatorcelebrates old-school filmmaking at its finest. We say \"old school\" only because Scorsese's love of golden-age Hollywood is evident in his approach to his subject--Howard Hughes in his prime (played by Leonardo DiCaprio in his)--and especially in his technical mastery of the medium reflecting his love for classical filmmaking of the studio era. Even when he's using state-of-the-art digital trickery for the film's exciting flight scenes (including one of the most spectacular crashes ever filmed), Scorsese's meticulous attention to art direction and costume design suggests an impassioned pursuit of craftsmanship from a bygone era; every frame seems to glow with gilded detail. And while DiCaprio bears little physical resemblance to Hughes during the film's 20-year span (late 1920s to late '40s), he efficiently captures the eccentric millionaire's golden-boy essence, and his tragic descent into obsessive-compulsive seclusion. Bolstered by Cate Blanchett's uncannily accurate portrayal of Katharine Hepburn as Hughes' most beloved lover,The Aviatoris easily Scorsese's most accessible film, inviting mainstream popularity without compromising Scorsese's artistic reputation. As compelling crowd-pleasers go, it's a class act from start to finish.--Jeff ShannonDVD FeaturesIn his commentary track, director Martin Scorsese offers his own impressions of Howard Hughes and rattles off his memories of experiencing Hughes's films.  He mentions how he made Cate Blanchett watch every Katharine Hepburn film from the '30s on the big screen, and observes that Kate Beckinsale had \"a real sense of the stature of a Hollywood goddess.\"  But in general he doesn't talk much about the craft of making the film.  That area is covered better by editor Thelma Schoonmaker, who also appears on the commentary track, and producer Michael Mann makes a few appearances (all were recorded separately).  The picture is brilliant, but the 5.1 sound is not as aggressive in the rear speakers and subwoofer as one might expect, other than some nice surround effects in theHell's Angelsflying sequence.The second disc collects almost three hours of features.  There's one unnecessary deleted scene, and an 11-minute making-of featurette that's basically the cast and director heaping praise on each other.  More interesting are the short featurettes on visual effects (including the XF-11 scene, of course), production design, costumes, hair and makeup, and score, and Loudon Wainwright discusses his and his children's musical performances.  Historical perspective is provided by spotlights on Hughes's role in aviation and his obsessive-compulsive disorder, and a 43-minute Hughes documentary from the History Channel (part of the Modern Marvels series, it focuses on his mechanical innovations and spends less than a minute on his movies).  More unusual are DiCaprio and Scorsese's appearance on an OCD panel, and a half-hour interview segment DiCaprio did with Alan Alda.--David HoriuchiThe Personalities ofThe AviatorClick the links to explore more movies by these stars.Leonardo DiCaprioasHoward Hughes\"Sometimes I truly fear that I... am losing my mind.

{"description": "Au hazard Balthazarcan have a profoundly moving effect on those who are sensitive to its power. Like any film by Robert Bresson, it provokes widely different responses: Many critics have hailed it as a masterpiece, while others (as Pauline Kael observed) \"may find it painstakingly tedious and offensively holy.\" It all depends on what the viewer brings to Bresson's seemingly simple tale of a donkey named Balthazar, who experiences kindness and cruelty as he is passed from owner to owner. Populated by a variety of sinners and saints alike, the film can be seen as a simple animal fable, as Balthazar suffers nobly at the hands of his handlers. Dig deeper into Bresson's art, however, and you're likely to find a very Catholic story with strong parallels to the life of Christ and his unbearable burden of the sins of mankind.No matter how you approach the film, only the most cold-hearted viewer will be immune to Balthazar's fate. And if you're not sure what to make of it all, this superb Criterion DVD offers two essential bonus features to guide you toward a greater understanding of Bresson's approach to cinema: Film scholar and devoted \"Bressonian\" Donald Richie offers his astute observations in a 2004 video interview, and in an in-depth French TV appearance from 1966, Bresson talks at length aboutAu hazard Balthazaralong with fellow directors Louis Malle and Jean-Luc Godard, and members of the film's cast and crew. This is a remarkable document from a bygone era, when \"art film\" was at its peak, and directors (especially French ones) were eager to discuss the intellectual significance of their work. Kudos to Criterion for including this archival gem of film appreciation.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BB14IA", "B000K0YLX2", "B00AQ6J6H6", "B001LMU19G", "0780022343", "B000087EY6", "6305257450", "6305744114", "B008DL4K8Q", "B00005M2C7", "B005152C7S", "B000127IF2", "B00AQ6J3AG", "B000C8Q900", "B00005JLV7", "B00EO2I6W4", "B009VO9XSG", "B001TIQT7A", "B00HE011DE", "B0007989Y8", "B000I8OOG0", "B0007OC6ZG", "B00005BHW6", "B001UF5KOU", "B0000A02TX", "B001TIQT6G", "B00GA9F2PI", "B00CUKTHJ8", "B009RWRIMA", "B0016AKSOG", "B000BB14I0", "B000N2HBIO", "B006X96PBU", "B00005UQ7T", "B000093NR0", "B00HVOFP6W", "B00005EBSF", "B00009ME9Z", "B005HK13S6", "B000BR6QIW", "B00BX49B0C", "B000AQKUG8", "B00180R06I", "B00KE3B6NI", "B001BEK8C4", "B004WPYO7E", "B00DHN8GQ2", "B00KE3B6LA", "B001LMU1C8", "B000E5LEV0", "B005152CC8", "6305131104", "B0001GH5RY", "B001ILTUKG", "B0016B6ZEC", "B002BWP4A6", "B001298BPY", "B000C8Q8ZQ", "B002U6DVQ2", "B007A9EGB8", "B00005NC66", "B004NWPY20", "B00000F7E6", "B001BEK8CE", "B00GBT629C", "B00DZP1C3Q", "B000PKG6O4", "B00A8QDHYW", "6305081034", "B002AFX53C", "B001LMU1B4", "B00HVOFP08", "B00004Z1FM", "B000EOTWIS", "B005HK13OK", "B00DZP1BUU", "B0035G5IOE", "B000M2E3GS", "B004CGUC10", "B00005QAPH", "B00005QAPJ", "B007A9EGC2", "B001WLMOL4", "B000IHYXH6", "B0000633SD", "B000HKH0WY", "B000FUF7CQ", "B000XQ4HQO", "B00JGR3M26", "B004NWPY34", "B00L3ZB7PS", "B00023P4N8", "B008CJ0JS4", "B00003CXUM", "B00GG0NABE", "B0007989ZC", "B001IZNIV4", "B005VU9LP4", "B000093NQY", "0292776241"], "bought_together": ["B000BB14IA", "B000K0YLX2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001EOQCJE", "6305428239", "B001QOGYBI", "B0000640VJ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 88549}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 20.17, "brand": "WIAZEMSKY,ANNE", "asin": "B00092ZLEY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41MLI-OZspL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Au Hasard Balthazar (The Criterion Collection)"}
{"description": "Fans of Christina Ricci will note that the saucer-eyed actress takes a big leap from deadpan-child and grumpy-ingenue roles withProzac Nation, an adaptation of Elizabeth Wurtzel's bestselling book. Ricci puts her all into playing Lizzie, a self-absorbed Ivy League writer wannabe who alienates friends and family with her out-of-control mood swings and other chemical imbalances. Ricci is committed and convincing, but nothing she does ameliorates Lizzie's exasperating personality; spending 90 minutes around this person is an eternity of tantrums. Around to provide audience stand-ins are Jason Biggs, Michelle Williams, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, all of whom disapprove of Lizzie's self-destructive behavior. Jessica Lange, professional as always, is Lizzie's brittle mother. If the movie really did capture the sense of the zeitgeist suggested by its grandiose title, or if it carried some intriguing stylistic urgency that carried us into its depressive labyrinth, perhaps Lizzie's journey would be palatable.

{"description": "Will Smith's easygoing charm makesHitchthe kind of pleasant, uplifting romantic comedy that you could recommend to almost anyone--especially if there's romance in the air. As suave Manhattan dating consultant Alex \"Hitch\" Hitchens, Smith plays up the smoother, sophisticated side of his established screen persona as he mentors a pudgy accountant (Kevin James) on the lessons of love. The joke, of course, is that Hitch's own love life is a mess, and as he coaches James toward romance with a rich, powerful, and seemingly inaccessible beauty named Allegra (Amber Valetta), he's trying too hard to impress a savvy gossip columnist (Eva Mendes) with whom he's fallen in love. Through mistaken identities and mismatched couples, director Andy Tennant brings the same light touch that made Drew Barrymore'sEver Afterso effortlessly engaging. As romantic comedies go,Hitchdoesn't offer any big surprises, but as a date movie it gets the job done with amiable ease and style.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009RCPUW", "B001QERPAC", "B0013J55B6", "B000N6U0E2", "B0001Z3TXE", "B00005JN0T", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AEFY99O", "B003Y5H4ZW", "B000VXWX7E", "B002K0WBXW", "B000803BQC", "B000BKVQS4", "B000HT386M", "B003Y5H574", "0800141741", "6305428115", "B00007E2F5", "B00005JMW7", "B00AEBB9WI", "B00008G8M4", "B002VECM6S", "B000LC3ICE", "B000ELJAEM", "B00003CXSM", "B004EPZ0BG", "B00AEBB8NS", "076780421X", "B00164KYV4", "B00AEFY0F2", "B003Y5H524", "B000VG66XS", "B00008WJD6", "B00AEFXWXI", "B002ZG998G", "B002ZG989G", "B000YDBPAM", "B000CEV3KU", "B00005JPE3", "B000AP04FG", "B00005JLQN", "B001C5LLQ4", "B00003CXO1", "B002P413IC", "B0001AVZA8", "B0012KJ0DK", "B0015I2RT8", "B000E6EHE0", "B001NPD9RM", "B00008VFCA", "B00006ZXSL", "B000FGGWGK", "B000098XQ8", "B001OQCUZM", "B000MQC9H4", "B00005JN3W", "B00005IBN0", "B003BV8ICC", "B00006FMUW", "B001SN78JO", "B000RBA6C4", "B0009UZGIM", "B001GKJ2E8", "B00005JNTU", "B000ZBEOEC", "B00AEFY4CG", "B0000B1OFL", "B008RNYMG0", "B0038N9WKU", "B0021L8UYY", "B000683VI4", "6304765266", "B000TZJBPQ", "B00005JLSB", "B0007PLLBU", "B000059TG6", "B002ZG9968", "B003EYVXXC", "B0000897EG", "B00005JM4Q", "B004IK30MI", "B00081U7HC", "B002ZG97B0", "B000P0J0EW", "B00005O5CM", "B005F2JRUC", "B000ASDFGI", "B00005JKCH", "B0006GAI5U", "B0000AKCKI", "B001UV4XRY", "B00005JMQW", "B0010X5X4O", "B000M341QE", "B001AKTZW8", "B00024JC4E", "B00AEBB8R4", "B00005JKMQ", "B00CLSBNNM", "B005LAII2Q"], "bought_together": ["B000N6U0E2", "B001QERPAC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000N6U0E2", "B002ZG97TW", "B002VECM6S", "B000AP04FG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 105544}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.94, "brand": "SMITH,WILL", "asin": "B000957O7S", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41jGu0AHCAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hitch (Fullscreen Edition)"}

{"description": "The sum of its parts was definitely greater than the season whole asGilmore Girlskicked off its fourth year by separating its high-powered mother-daughter duo. After years of toil at snooty private school Chilton, Rory (Alexis Bledel) was finally off to the greener pastures of college as she began her first year at Yale. The not-so-long distance put a crimp in her relationship with her mother, Lorelai (Lauren Graham), as the two were forced to continue their chatty conversations via phone--not exactly the same as trading barbs face-to-face. While Rory adjusted to college life with cranky roommate Paris (Liza Weil) in tow, Lorelai found herself without a daughter, but gained a boyfriend in the form of Jason \"Digger\" Stiles (Chris Eigeman), a childhood friend and now her father's business partner. But the lure of Stars Hollow, the Gilmores' cherished country town, would prove too hard to resist, as Lorelai finally made plans to open her own inn, and the two ladies found themselves attracted to town residents--for Lorelai, an intensifying of her friendship with diner owner Luke (Scott Patterson), and for Rory, a return to old boyfriend Dean (Jared Padalecki), which put a decided tension into a show that sorely needed it. Nevermind that both men were married to other women!The first half of the fourth season definitely foundered, as the show's usually topnotch creative team struggled to find a way to keep the Gilmore chemistry afloat despite separating their main characters. There wasn't much drama to be found for Rory in starting college, and though it got off to a great start, Lorelai's relationship with Jason never fully gelled. However, once the show got its girls into the arms of their Stars Hollow men, it turned around almost immediately, surging towards a creative revival that put its ratings higher than they'd ever been before. Along the way to its surprising and complex season finale, there were great episodes to be had: \"Girls in Bikinis, Boys Doin' the Twist,\" which found Rory and Paris on spring break; \"The Reigning Lorelai,\" centering on an unexpected funeral; \"The Festival of Living Art,\" which had Stars Hollow resident re-creating classic works; and \"Luke Can See Her Face,\" which finally brought the Luke-Lorelai romance to the forefront. The season may have started out rough, but this fourth year ended with a bang, and the promise of more fireworks to come.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002BJGYTY", "B002BJGYV2", "B002BJGYU8", "B000G1R4SY", "B000N6TYLW", "B0001CCXZW", "B006WZIAHM", "B009MA9ZW8", "B00006JIBS", "B00G4SB5Z6", "B004STBF2G", "B0030Y12A0", "B000YAA2SQ", "B001FB4VZ8", "B00079FUI6", "B00B5AAW52", "B003QZSWRY", "B000R7HRRA", "B001ILFUAA", "1933771178", "B0006ZM8M2", "B0077PTWY6", "B0077PTWHI", "B0018CWEVW", "B001QUXNQG", "B000HT3PEM", "B00BGQ2NIO", "B00AEFYQE2", "B00BC0JH24", "B002BAW6I6", "B000NA1PUG", "B001FSKE84", "B00AOCZOLO", "B0001EQHXO", "B0012BS5XU", "B00G6HO368", "B005IA9JQ8", "B000Q6GUKW", "B0009K7QZ8", "0345532767", "B0040QTNSA", "B00005JO9J", "B00005JNOG", "B002BAW6HW", "B002W1HBK2", "B005IA9JRM", "B00871C09S", "B00003CXC3", "B001MVWRN4", "B002ZG988M", "B001DPHDBU", "B0006FFRBG", "B002ZG976U"], "bought_together": ["B002BJGYTY", "B002BJGYV2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002BJGYTY", "B0001CCXZW", "B002BJGYU8", "B002BJGYV2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 37394}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 12.95, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0009WFF6S", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QBGyzDPsL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gilmore Girls: Season 4 (Digipack)"}

{"description": "Movie studios, by and large, avoid controversial subjects like race the way you might avoid a hive of angry bees. So it's remarkable thatCrasheven got made; that it's a rich, intelligent, and moving exploration of the interlocking lives of a dozen Los Angeles residents--black, white, latino, Asian, and Persian--is downright amazing. A politically nervous district attorney (Brendan Fraser) and his high-strung wife (Sandra Bullock, biting into a welcome change of pace fromMiss Congeniality) get car-jacked by an oddly sociological pair of young black men (Larenz Tate and Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges); a rich black T.V. director (Terrence Howard) and his wife (Thandie Newton) get pulled over by a white racist cop (Matt Dillon) and his reluctant partner (Ryan Phillipe); a detective (Don Cheadle) and his Latina partner and lover (Jennifer Esposito) investigate a white cop who shot a black cop--these are only three of the interlocking stories that reach up and down class lines. Writer/director Paul Haggis (who wrote the screenplay forMillion Dollar Baby) spins every character in unpredictable directions, refusing to let anyone sink into a stereotype. The cast--ranging from the famous names above to lesser-known but just as capable actors like Michael Pena (Buffalo Soldiers) and Loretta Devine (Woman Thou Art Loosed)--meets the strong script head-on, delivering galvanizing performances in short vignettes, brief glimpses that build with gut-wrenching force.

{"description": "Lorna Doone was filmed three times before in the silent era, and six times more in the sound era, but the 1922 production directed by Maurice Tourneur is arguably one of the finest, and without a doubt the most beautiful. Like most of the feature adaptations of Lorna Doone, the 1922 version allows the romance and action of the novel to exist largely untouched by the tumult of the English Civil War. A young girl of noble birth is kidnapped by the Doones, a feared band of thieves and cutthroats. Their leader, fallen nobleman Sir Ensor Doone, raises the girl, Lorna, as one of his own kin. Lorna secretly falls in love with yeoman John Ridd, but must contend with the brutish Carver Doone, who wants Lorna for his own.  In Lorna Doone, Tourneur uses natural lighting and the landscape to frame his actors with painterly effect, showcasing a very different set of aesthetic values than those of The Blue Bird, with its elaborate stylized sets and costumes. Both are representative gems of his silent work, much of which remains lost.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00JRHW4GK", "1497372755", "B000H5U5IK", "B00J84NGBE", "B00006LPE4", "B000FS9FLC", "B00IGK6TGU", "B00D8HNRBG", "B0006Q93LA", "B00D9BNONW", "B000LY271A", "B000A59QJ6", "B008JEJSB6", "B0018W2L0G", "B004OOL73W", "B0017OLUV6", "B0013XZ6RK", "B0000E68WC", "B004YOED9M", "B000094J73", "B004TPJN0K", "B000FS9FLM", "B000094J75", "B00064AEWY", "B000EQHXJQ", "B000QRIKR2", "B001AD6UFA", "B008I3Q0B4", "B00014NF66", "B001GOEYAG", "B0007NMKSU", "B00005M2CH", "B000TUDHJ2", "B00005M1ZO", "B008ERNLFC", "B000067IYD", "B000094J79", "B000EQHXIW", "B003N0E5DW", "B00A33J8PM", "B008I3Q0FK", "B002BEXFNW", "B00007CVSA", "B00000JMOO", "B000FSME5Q", "B00BF36ZXC", "B00005ASOT", "B00004W19B", "0911572759", "B009NVZCV4", "B000056N7V", "B0046CLSGS", "B00014NF5W", "B007UQ8ISI", "B003YBNNMY", "B00005O5CD", "B0000E69GR", "B000V3IX82", "B0056HTEHW", "B0000633SZ", "B005C7FWZE", "B0016A2FGU", "B00004Z4VE", "B002MZZU6A", "B000EGDCGO", "B000EOTWBK", "B000BC8T0K", "B00004Z4TJ", "B000EUM4JQ", "B000FJTV7Y", "B00007L4MH", "B0066E6PA8", "B0024R1CF4", "B00008H2GZ", "B007XTDXX2", "B007XTDWS8", "B008PVQQ3G", "B00AYNG796", "B00ARKYSWE", "B00917IQ1I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005B1VM", "B0000AQS3P", "B004KK3IIC"]}, "price": 16.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 270311}, "asin": "B000A59QIW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516T5PEWE4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lorna Doone"}

{"description": "A sitcom behemoth of the last 10 years,Friendsshot out of the gate in 1994 with snappy writing and an attractive cast. The exploits of sensitive paleontologist Ross Geller (David Schwimmer), his obsessive-compulsive sister Monica Geller (Courteney Cox); Monica's roommate Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston), a spoiled rich girl trying to live on her own; earthy aromatherapist/masseuse Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow); and Monica's neighbors across the hall-- sarcastic Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry) and his dim-bulb roommate Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc) became a nationwide obsession, a pop-culture icon (remember \"The Rachel\" haircut?)  and a top Nielsen hit for its entire run.See the10 or more seasons club.The first two seasons were mostly centered on the on-off saga of Ross and Rachel, and while their relationship remained a strong presence through romantic rivals and even a baby,View clips andvote for your favoriteFriendsmoment.the other characters eventually moved from sideshow players into a shared comedic lead. ButFriendswas not without its heart. Most of the cast had dysfunctional relationships with their parents and went through loss, divorce, marriage, parenthood, and love triangles. The emotional pregnancies of Rachel (by Ross) and Phoebe (surrogate to her half-brother's triplets) won the actresses Emmy Awards, and Joey's tender feelings for Rachel in Season 8 won LeBlanc, the most improved actor in the series, a nomination.Most sitcoms run out of ideas by the fifth season, butFriendsgave itself a refreshing jolt the minute Monica and Chandler wound up in bed together. Their budding romance was not only the one of the funniest arcs of the series, but one of the most sentimental, as they planned a wedding, struggled to have a child and eventually turned to adoption. By seasons seven and on, the characters had each \"grown up\" from young singletons to thirtysomethings finding permanence in their careers and love lives but never losing the laughs.Just friends? See our guide towho kissed whomonFriends.Friendsfeatured a parade of celebrity guests, but unlikeWill & Grace, it actually utilized most of the stars as more than cameos: The sextet's parents were all brilliantly cast, particularly Kathleen Turner as Chandler's drag-queen father and Teri Garr as Phoebe's dizzy mom. Everyone from George Clooney to Sean Penn to Julia Roberts to Bruce Willis has appeared on the sitcom, and Tom Selleck certainly enjoyed a career resuscitation after his recurring role as Monica's older man.But no star power ever penetrated the bond between the six stars, and their unmatchable chemistry worked for 10 seasons. Even if the show is on reruns daily, this boxed set ofFriendsremains watchable over and over again--even if that theme song grates on your nerves.Standout episodes include The One With All The Poker (Season 1), The One With The Birth (1), The One With the Prom Video (2), The One With the Flashback (3), The One Where Monica and Richard are Just Friends (3), The One Where Ross and Rachel Take a Break (3), The One With the Embryos (4), The One With All the Wedding Dresses (4), The One With the Thanksgiving Flashbacks (5), The One Where Everybody Finds Out (5), The One Where Ross Got High (6), The One With the Videotape (8), The One With the Rumor (8), The One With the Male Nanny (9), The One With Rachel's Other Sister (9), The One With Ross' Tan (10), and The One Where the Stripper Cries (10).--Ellen A.

{"description": "Home to some of the world's best food and fashion, the French also have the wonderful habit of producing some of the world's best movies. WithHigh Tension, French director Alexandre Aja offers up a bloody buffet of terror; a violent concoction of style over substance, with a bloody French twist.       Two college girlfriends, Maria and Alex, take a weekend to study at the secluded country home of Alex's parents.   Shortly after their arrival, a mysterious killer appears, and things take a shockingly terrible turn for the worse. As the horror and body count rises, Maria and Alex find themselves fighting for their lives, and it's revealed that things are not exactly as they seem.     Essentially a one-act cat-and-mouse affair,High Tensionis an explosive bloody thrill ride that rarely lets up.   Oozing style in every color-saturated frame and boasting some intense performances, Aja mainly succeeds in sustaining an intense momentum throughout the film.  The plot occasionally suffers from a thin, flimsy storyline, and the abundant graphic scenes of violence will either thrill and delight, or simply disgust.   Nonetheless, this adrenalin-fueled addition to the genre gives the American slasher flick a real run for its money.High Tensionis high-art horror, and comes highly recommended.--Matt Wold", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001MEJY8W", "B0014VPFVS", "B00125WATQ", "B000EOTVU2", "B000GI3KGC", "B0009WFEDC", "B002EOVXBK", "B00GGY4R3K", "B001G9CNI6", "B00005K9O8", "B000WC38EQ", "B00009W0U4", "B000X1RYEQ", "B0041KKYCY", "B004AC6PV2", "B000EHRVP6", "B0028DRGDQ", "B000N3AW6G", "B005SQRYB4", "B001MFNB4O", "B000GSYRY6", "B000IHY9TS", "B000S0GYRU", "B00009MEC4", "B00187FPC2", "B001D2WU9I", "B0000CABGW", "B001B187L6", "B00G5GNYY2", "B008G1JIQC", "B001JV5BIA", "B002LMSWN2", "B000WC389G", "B0082A3HFK", "B002OVO18A", "B004P2VQZ2", "B00699G622", "B0009OUBC4", "B008JFUNYG", "B000FS9FE4", "B004EI2NP4", "B0013D8L7M", "B008NNY8XQ", "B000GI3RHY", "B00J81S92S", "B001D5C1OO", "B0031U8OEK", "B00196UTEG", "B006QWC2ZC", "B008WAM2E2", "B0015ET3YO", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000MM0LIM", "B00BSU0FQA", "B008BM5WQG", "B00AJLHUA8", "B000GLL1U6", "B003Q6D246", "B0083H6B0U", "B00006FDBW", "B001MVYUR0", "B000IMUYJM", "B00DMUFXOS", "B0021L8UPS", "B000099T3M", "B00CU00JTU", "B003L20IEC", "B0051CSIKQ", "B000NVT0TI", "B00DPUB5EW", "B001D5C1R6", "B00C7C00JU", "B000VKL6Z2", "B006U49SC6", "B0052DP1RC", "B00AZTUUQK", "B002DKGWSE", "B000FZEQWI", "B000RW5BZ0", "B0001611DI", "B0057O6IMS", "B00111YM5Q", "B00177YA6U", "B000UW8596", "B005ER6STG", "B0007WQHI0", "B00079HZY8", "B0009S2T0M", "B00005Q4CS", "B000PKG8TW", "B00006AUIG", "B000AXWHSA", "B001RTKKQW", "B003KGBISE", "B008G33PIM", "B004KDYR20", "6305228876", "B000PMLJMQ", "B002YICNE2", "B0060AAMEI"], "bought_together": ["B001MEJY8W", "B0014VPFVS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001MEJY8W", "B0014VPFVS", "B00GGY4R3K", "B000GI3KGC"]}, "price": 8.37, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23934}, "asin": "B000ARFPMQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K3uQHsEXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "High Tension (Unrated Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "House of Dis a bittersweet, moving story of an American expatriate's painful decision to come to terms with the childhood he fled in early 1970s New York City. David Duchovny wrote and directed this comedy-drama; he also stars as the adult version of the film's hero, Tom Warshaw, an illustrator who has spent most of his life in Paris and decides&#x97;on the occasion of his son's birthday&#x97;to finally reveal long-withheld facts about his past.The bulk of the story, told in flashback, portrays 13-year-old Tom (Anton Yelchin) as a quick-witted prince of his neighborhood, a delivery boy who knows every eccentric on his bicycle route and a Catholic school kid fond of playing pranks on his clueless French teacher and soulful principal (Frank Langella). His best friend is the school's mildly retarded, 41-year-old janitor, Pappas (Robin Williams), and his advisor on matters of the heart is Lady (Erykah Badu), a prison inmate whom the fatherless Tom (or Tommy, as he's called in 1973) can neither see nor touch. Tommy's vivacity is an asset at home, where his mother (Tea Leoni), a grieving widow with a mounting addiction to pills, is slipping away from her son's ability to help. Duchovny's screenplay sometimes borders on the precious: A number of scenes are enamored with their own boldness and originality, as if Duchovny has been squirreling away lots of colorfully expressive storytelling details for years, and unloaded them here. But that flaw all but disappears in the glow ofHouse of D's emotional resonance and honesty, not to mention several exceptional performances. Among these is Zelda Williams's work as Tommy's sage-beyond-her-years girlfriend, Melissa, whose name offers a suitable excuse to work a rather lovely Allman Brothers song into the soundtrack.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0019X3YTQ", "B0007XG4XW", "B0043X1FM2", "6305262128", "B00008L3U1", "B00005UQ9V", "B00J5JSV3A", "B000N4RAR4", "B00005V9HT", "B00175VSBC", "B00BX8PG5M", "B0002XNT1C", "B004SIP6VI", "B00007AJFD", "6304584210", "B00114XTHA", "B003EYVXOG", "6306012419", "B000085EFG", "B0019X3YUA", "B003IQBLSI", "B0000694XY", "B000BYA4IS", "B00000IQV7", "B000YV1Q2G", "B00AEFXGIY", "B004SUDQ72", "B003LR5BD0", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B0071HPOLK", "B002PI1NRO", "0788815466", "B001FACH7S", "B004ZJZQAQ", "B004SIP6C2", "B008220A62", "B00003CWS3", "B000B8QG22", "B004SIP7ZS", "B0009H97HG", "B003EYVXOQ", "B00007976U", "B005QX8U2Q", "B0013N2WFY", "B00079HZOS", "B00133KFGW", "B000FDEVA2", "B002QQ8HAG", "B00000J11D", "1558908404", "B000OYC7BW", "B00BTYRB3U", "B00AEFYMGO", "B006YTGL86", "B00003CXQ4", "B000M341SC", "B000035Z3C", "B000077VQ6", "B000286RP2", "B000LC5B7O", "B0000714C4", "B002GIBVVQ", "B000NO39FG", "B003B3O5K4", "B00CYQXCDK", "B00AEFYVZQ", "B00003CXE4", "B00003CX8N", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B000063US3", "B00DL46ZN8", "B0007X7044", "B001CIOCLC", "B0043X1FL8", "B001JIE7JC", "B009AMAL4Y", "B00CCXL9OE", "B000P5FH3K", "B00004Y62V", "B0009UZGIM", "B000957O82"], "bought_together": ["B0007XG4XW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007XG4XW", "B00BTYNXJG", "B0019X3YTQ", "B000UAE7KO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 175614}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.73, "brand": "LION&#39;S GATE ENTERTAINMENT", "asin": "B000ARFPNK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K4DAM9FWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "House of D"}

{"description": "The fifth season ofSeinfeldis without a doubt the series' best. By their fifth year, theSeinfeldgang had ironed out the bumps from the first two seasons, further developing characters.  The loyal fan base that had been accumulating over the years was now more or less the entire nation&#x92;s viewing audience. The pressure was on to give this new, mega fan base a high dose of their unique, misanthropic comedy, and Jerry (Jerry Seinfeld), George (Jason Alexander), Elaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) and Kramer (Michael Richards) delivered in spades. Yes, other seasons may have funnier individual episodes, but as a whole season five consistently delivers the goods, including many of the show's all-time classic episodes.  In the season opener, Jerry discovers the secret, sexual power of \"The Mango.\" While vacationing in \"The Hamptons\" we not only learn that George&#x92;s date likes to sunbathe topless in front of his friends, but also that cold water has the power to shrink. In \"The Stall&#x92; Elaine is rejected while trying to share toilet paper only to learn that the selfish neighbor is Jerry&#x92;s girlfriend.  In order to really make a life change, George decides to do \"The Opposite\" of all his instincts and surprisingly everything in his life falls perfectly into place. And of course, who can forget the ridiculous puffy shirt Kramer&#x92;s low-talking girlfriend talks Jerry into wearing onThe Today Show. This box set also includes the featurette \"Jason+Larry=George\" explaining how Jason Alexander embodied Larry David&#x92;s alter ego to create George Costanza, plus deleted and behind-the-scenes footage and exclusive stand up footage of Jerry Seinfeld.--Rob Bracco", "related": {"also_bought": ["B008LCRA7K", "B0007YXRCW", "B008LCRA98", "B008LCRABQ", "B0002UE1WQ", "B008LCRAC0", "B00005JLEX", "B00070HK4C", "B0001BS3IY", "B0002UE1X0", "B001AEF6AY", "B0001NBNJ8", "B000FBH3WC", "B007KFZ8B4", "B000M341S2", "B000MX7V5W", "B0000E2PVR", "B00BXTH474", "B004SIP9O2", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B000067S1G", "B003TNW030", "B0024FAD9W", "B000Y7U9AK", "B000SINT4S", "B000T22PVG", "B002VJ05E4", "B00005AVCA", "B000957O8C", "B000BOH98G", "B0058EE6O4", "B0009VBTP0", "B00005N5S5", "B000ERVJMW", "B000NA1W3Q", "B0019D151K", "B002E58FU6", "B009LDD4BO", "B000NOKFH6", "B00BUWD7Y8", "B002E58FT2", "B000G6BL88", "B007KFZ8AA", "B000GETTKM", "B002GHHHP6", "B000RO6JZY", "B000AQ68VO", "B005IA9JQ8", "B000P0J06U", "B0007YMVWO", "B0007Y08RY", "B00008PW1F", "B004FQX59I", "0790732157", "B003L77G9W", "B003L77GDS", "B003UD7JAI", "B009LDD1X0", "B000OHZKZ4", "B00K8HAJN8", "B00016JE5U", "B004STBFPS", "B00E96AY20", "B00005JLYW", "B00I458456", "B00FEVZ960", "B005D0OHA6", "B00FE5MZWM", "B00BT1XCOU", "B0053O89WY", "B000VNMMPW", "B00HNGC56G", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000K7VHTQ", "B000065V3E", "B005IA9JVI", "0936070463", "B0083XXWRE", "B005IA9JQI", "B005IA9JRM", "B000G6BLWE"], "bought_together": ["B008LCRA7K", "B008LCRA98"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007YXRCW", "B0002UE1WQ", "B008LCRA98", "B008LCRA7K"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 26980}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 13.49, "brand": "Sony Pictures", "asin": "B000BBOUEU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N5PWdD5ML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Seinfeld: Season 5"}

{"description": "With Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson as a pair of brazen wedding crashers, this buddy/romantic comedy milks a few big laughs from its foolproof premise. Under the direction of David Dobkin (who previously worked with Wilson onShanghai Knights), the movie ranges from bawdy romp to mushy romance, and that tonal identity crisis curtails the overall hilarity. But when the well-teamed costars are firing on all pistons with fast-paced dialogue and manic situations, belly laughs are delivered at a steady clip. Things get complicated when the guys infiltrate the family of the Treasury Secretary (Christopher Walken), resulting in a romantic pair-off between Vaughn and the congressman's oversexed daughter Gloria (Isla Fisher) while Wilson sincerely woos another daughter, Claire (Rachel McAdams), who's unhappily engaged to an Ivy League cheater (Bradley Cooper). Walken is more or less wasted in his role, but Jane Seymour and Henry Gibson make amusing appearances, and a surprise guest arrives late in the game for some over-the-top scene-stealing. It's all a bit uneven, but McAdams (considered by some to be \"the next Julia Roberts\") is a pure delight, and with enough laughs to make it easily recommended,Wedding Crasherswill likely find its place on DVD shelves alongside other flawed but enjoyable R-rated comedies that embrace a naughtier, nastier brand of humor with no need for apologies.--Jeff ShannonVince Vaughn's MoviesWhy We Love Rachel McAdamsOwen Wilson's MoviesThe SoundtrackThe Return of Crass ComedyThe 40-Year-Old Virgin", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFYS2M", "B000ELJAEM", "B00466HN7M", "B008R65XNS", "B00005JNZU", "B00006FMUW", "B000J4P9P8", "B002ZGW92E", "B001G5T6GW", "B000WZEZGI", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B00003CXSM", "B001TUZD8O", "B000HCPS94", "B001C0JCBA", "B0009HBPN0", "B001OD4S50", "B00005JMYI", "B00005JG6N", "B004EPZ084", "B0015I2RT8", "B00AEFYAMA", "B00AEBB8NS", "B00AEFXJS6", "B000069CF0", "B000TZJBPQ", "B00003CXO1", "B001C5LLQ4", "B0009OL7Z4", "B0007RT9M6", "B00005JMW7", "B001J9KJ4I", "B0006GANPA", "B003Y5H574", "B000BKJ762", "B000E6EHE0", "B003Y5H524", "B000ICM5X0", "B00AEFY7I2", "B002K0WBXW", "B00AEBB9K0", "B000VXWX7E", "B0013D8LHC", "B004HO6I2E", "B001DPHDB0", "B0016MOV92", "B00AEFYM2S", "B004EPZ070", "B000JJ4DNW", "B003CRM6PA", "B00BEIYMZ6", "B008R65XMO", "B00005JMX6", "B00AEBBA2C", "B004EPZ06G", "B004EPYZS0", "B003Y5H5B0", "B00024JC4E", "B0000AKCKI", "B000957O82", "B00AEFYQE2", "B00DV2MVWO", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B001L9EXTS", "B0041KKYGU", "B00AEFZ3XU", "B002U4UYZA", "B000CPH9PM", "B000EMGJAO", "B000M341QE", "B008R65XUQ", "B00005JMCT", "B001AKTZW8", "B00008WJD6", "B00AEFYSL8", "B002P413IC", "B00AEFXVW0", "B002ZG99H2", "B0000A02TZ", "B005LAII12", "B001SN78JO", "B008JFUORW", "B000LC3ICE", "B002T9H2LA", "B0051MKNRC", "B003HKN52U", "B000CCBCAS", "B00AEFYZCU", "B002ZG980U", "B00AEFY99O", "B002VWNIEA", "B0000524E5", "B004AV5GX6", "B000A343RI", "B000EMGJ7C", "B004LWZW5G", "B00AEFXDO6", "B00000K3UU", "B004SIP95G", "B0009RCPUW"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFYS2M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00466HN7M", "B001G5T6GW", "B003Y5H5B0", "B000J4P9P8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 92528}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.95, "brand": "New Line Home Video", "asin": "B000BKVQRU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z2E7093FL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wedding Crashers (R-Rated Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "While hardcore Trekkers may not find a lot of new material inStar Trek Collective: Borg, newcomers experiencing 16 action-packed, fan-selected episodes of the Federation's greatest villains may have to prepare to be assimilated.  All the episodes have been previously released on DVD, but there are new text commentaries on three of the episodes, and the per-disc price is significantly less expensive than the full-seasonTreksets. It's a great entry point for novices, or for budget-minded fans.The episodes are presented in Stardate order, which means starting withEnterprise, the latest series but also the earliest in chronological order.  In \"Regeneration,\" an exploration team finds a pair of apparently dead humanoid-mechanical hybrids that turn out to be members of the Borg, a nearly invincible race whose simple goal is to absorb--\"assimilate\"--every individual organism it encounters into its collective being.  Because the Borg has the ability to adapt itself to resist any threat, resistance is futile.  Shift ahead toThe Next Generationand a visit by the quirky god Q turns out to have deadly implications when, in a pouty mood, he throws theEnterpriseinto their first encounter with the Borg.  That's followed by the classic two-part cliffhanger (bridging seasons 3 and 4) \"The Best of Both Worlds,\" in which Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) is assimilated into the Borg and a frustrated Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes) has to make a fateful decision. \"I, Borg\" attempts to give the Borg a humanized aspect, and the two-parter \"Descent\" has some interesting developments for Data (Brent Spiner).  SkipDeep Space Ninein favor ofVoyager, the series in which Captain Janeway's (Kate Mulgrew) ship is stranded far from home in the Delta Quadrant.  That happens to be home turf for the Borg, so they had a number of run-ins.  The first two-parter (which bridged seasons 3 and 4) is \"Scorpion,\" which introduces the Borg's nemesis, Species 8472.  By the time of \"Drone,\" the ship had its first Borg crew member, the sexy Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan), but her loyalties are tempted by the Borg Queen (Susanna Thompson) in the double-length \"Dark Frontier.\" In the \"Unimatrix Zero\" two-parter, which bridged seasons 6 and 7, Seven discovers an idyllic haven for members of the Collective that the Queen is determined to find and destroy.  That eventually leads to an ultimate confrontation with the Queen (now played by Alice Krige, repeating her role fromStar Trek: First Contact) in the series finale, \"Endgame.\"--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000ERVJJ0", "B000CSUNLQ", "B000FEBWTY", "B001AII4RC", "B000P5FH44", "B002I9Z8EO", "B002MU4NM2", "B001TH16CO", "B001TH16CE", "B002MU4NLS", "B002I9Z8G2", "B00IUR3YI0", "B00005JLRT", "B000127LW2", "B00023P4F6", "B002I9Z8GM", "B00005JKHP", "6305181721", "B00000ILBK", "B0001NBNFW", "B00BAXTY8U", "B0007TKH66", "B00062IDCO", "B000HEWEJ4", "B0002WZTCA", "B00062IDLA", "B00DB97LRC", "B000228EBS", "B0002JP4GE", "B0064NLQYG", "B00D3XM3MY", "B002I9Z8GW", "B000AOEMXC", "B0000AUHOH", "B002I9Z8AS", "B005DEUEV8", "B002I9Z8I0", "B00BAXTYIA", "B00005Y1NF", "B00CTSDDVO", "B0000UJL96", "B002I9Z8BM", "1451657242", "B002HWRYJE", "B0009I7NGW", "B00BAXTYF8", "B00AZMFJYA", "146540337X", "B00008WFTU", "B001L9VTMW", "B002KX9CPO", "B00471JSRE", "B001DHXT6G", "B00404ME2E", "B0000UJLVY", "B006LPHY6G", "B00062RCC6", "6305910537", "B001B8TKFG", "B002PQ7JQK", "B0002MHDW4", "B00D9EJFZA", "B0000844IH", "B002KPINY8", "B00ENFS0GY", "B007USBGSA", "B001AR0D40", "145166818X", "B001LQQJ66", "B000VDDDY6", "B004BZ5AMI", "B000F8O2Q0", "B00008KA57", "B000031EGW", "0792160959", "B000062XFG", "B001AQO3XS", "B00005V5NQ", "B00CLA3Y2I", "B0017VG69U", "B00008KA58", "B00AO1RKW6", "B004EXWGJW", "B00HERGM86", "B002I9Z8DK", "B000RXVNDI", "B00022FWEU", "B0037QGS0K", "B001TH16DI", "B0083TUEHY", "B000A6CLL0", "B004EXWGHY", "B00AEBB8VK", "B0009JE6G6", "B0011FLGZQ", "B0011FLH00", "B00480OC0C", "B003HKN548", "B00A2H9OSK", "B00FEOYY8G"], "bought_together": ["B000ERVJJ0", "B000FEBWTY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000ERVJJ0", "B001AII4RC", "6305127638", "B000P5FH44"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 49941}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 18.99, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B000CCBCIA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41UmpxNAJBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek Fan Collective - Borg"}

{"description": "On the surface, David Cronenberg may seem an unlikely candidate to directA History of Violence, but dig deeper and you'll see that he's the right man for the job. As an intellectual seeker of meaning and an avowed believer in Darwinian survival of the fittest, Cronenberg knows that the story of mild-mannered small-town diner proprietor Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) is in fact a multilayered examination of inbred human behavior, beginning when Tom's skillful killing of two would-be robbers draws unwanted attention to his idyllic family life in rural Indiana. He's got a loving wife (Maria Bello) and young daughter (Heidi Hayes) who are about to learn things about Tom they hadn't suspected, and a teenage son (Ashton Holmes) who has inherited his father's most prominent survival trait, manifesting itself in ways he never expected. By the time Tom has come into contact with a scarred villain (Ed Harris) and connections that lead him to a half-crazy kingpin (William Hurt, in a spectacular cameo), Cronenberg has plumbed the dark depths of human nature so skillfully thatA History of Violencestands well above the graphic novel that inspired it (indeed, Cronenberg was unaware of the source material behind Josh Olson's chilling adaptation). With hard-hitting violence that's as sudden as it is graphically authentic, this isA History of Violencethat's worthy of serious study and widespread acclaim.--Jeff ShannonOn the DVDOn a single disc and with little fanfare, this DVD makes an excellent case for the best extras of the year. Dive into the one-hour-long documentary and learn more about moviemaking than on many a double-disc. The secret lies in director David Cronenberg's (and his usual crew) folksy casualness in showing off the craft, be it makeup (green screens were used), directing (Cronenberg doesn't storyboard), or art direction (the diner set). It also is very funny to hear about \"fish Fridays\" and how Maria Bello's Uncle Pete became an influence. Even the infamous sex-on-the-staircase scene is diagnosed with candor as stars Viggo Mortensen and Bello act as if there is no backstage camera. There's only one deleted scene, but it's uncommonly deconstructed on why it was filmed and why it was cut (it's a very Cronenbergian dream sequence). A short bit on Cannes is also a delight.

{"description": "Video: NTSC Audio: Dolby Digital Region: All Region Dialogue: Japanese Subtitles: Japanese, English Number of Disc(s): 1 Runtime: 114 min. Description: An alternate world with an alternate history. The entire planet was divided between two opposing alliances. After fifty years of bitter warfare, the Greater Eastern Federation triumphs over the forces of Europa and gains dominion over the Eurasian continent. However, this is an empty victory. Years of chemical, biological and nuclear war have poisoned the land and left an exhausted population at the mercy of every pestilence and newly-mutated disease. It seems that there's little hope for humanity's future. Debate rages over the chances of finding some way to stave off the seemingly-inevitable decline of civilization. One man comes forward with a possible solution. Dr. Azuma is a geneticist who proposes a \"neo-cell\" treatment that can rejuvenate the body and regenerate humankind. He's driven in his studies by a desire to save his beloved wife, Midori, from the ravages of pollution-related disease. He appeals for funding to the government but the politicians in the Health Ministry turn him down, fearing that the new technology will threaten their entrenched powers. However, a sinister faction in the powerful military makes a secret offer to provide the support he needs to further his research. When an incident occurs in the lab that sends the Professor's \"neo-cell\" cloning experiment haywire, a race of mutant human beings (Shinzo Ningen) is unleashed upon the world. Instead of being the savior of mankind, the Professor's miraculous technology looks set to threaten its very existence...", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001AZIRWW", "B00011V8JA", "B002BWD74G", "B000F2CAJ2", "B004DMIIUU", "B004DMIIO6", "B00A92MDMM", "B000HXDWOG", "B0043988KS", "B00B209RHY", "B00G3HOJZ6", "B000IMUYM4", "B00A92MBBA", "B008XEZXES", "B006C1S1DY", "B0019PL2W0", "B002KYIAKQ", "B002MD2YUM", "B0043988NK", "B0012SY0E6", "B00065GX0K", "B0002IQHAW", "B001UJUH1M", "B00J806VWY", "B0036BDQ2Y", "B001570H5K", "B00009RXI6", "B000JBXP5W", "B002C6VMIY", "B008IG0B0C", "B000FC2EWU", "B000E0OBKG", "B004XQO8MS", "B006H3KQSK", "B00J5LXS4U", "B00FJX967G", "B008L0YMSW", "B008D1RCKY", "B002P7UCJK", "B00ITAQ11U", "B00C6WHSRI", "B000GBEWNY", "B00CG0YLS4", "B00AN5LD2Q", "B005ENCIWG", "B00C3ALL9O", "B009VL2A5M", "B00005V4XG", "B0043988KI", "B001JTTJ94", "B005M9VSMI", "B008HHTEUU", "B00097E71C", "B001F0TT10", "B0030A6ICG", "B002KYIAL0", "B004VW4V9E", "B0000CABGW", "B00005ALMX", "B00287Z1CK", "B005F96UGO", "B000C6NP7M", "B0016K76V4", "B004GZZH6W", "B0009P42S2", "B004P2VQZ2", "B000JU8H74", "B005F96URI", "B008FIPQOE", "B00CG0YM24", "B00GXG16BC", "B0016LHH62", "B00HRYH52I", "B001AYWYEA", "B00GXGLQOO", "B004H2CXBQ", "B001BEK87Y", "B001MEJY9G", "B005HVWWB2", "B0056OZI0W", "B000FILUL0", "B00G3HOLV8", "B00104AYGK", "B00B4MMVVY", "B003NLE5J0", "B0007939U2", "B0002LJTF4", "B0002ZYE64", "B005ZMBEXU", "B006MWA8UW", "B00HSJ2BEE", "B0083QJW8O", "B00576U9HQ", "B003Y7F1IW", "B0017SVH5Q", "B000ICLU7C", "B006L4MWVE", "B00HXEWECI", "B009VL29I0", "B005HVWVCC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004DMIIUU", "B00DW5IM3W", "B00B209RHY", "B00A92MBBA"]}, "price": 17.88, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 241977}, "asin": "B000EDH80I", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41M0JT7Q53L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Casshern (DVD)"}
{"description": "Immensely popular when originally broadcast on Britain's Channel Four in 1992,The Camomile Lawnoffers ample proof that British TV drama rises well above American TV in terms of sophistication, maturity, and literary influence. Faithfully adapted by Ken Taylor (The Jewel in the Crown) from the novel by Mary Wesley, this five-part wartime drama bears some thematic and structural resemblance toThe Big Chill(in both films, a burial serves as a reunion for long-time friends) and chronicles a variety of secrets, lies, and passions among a close-knit group of relatives in Cornwall, just as World War II begins in 1939. The funeral that frames this fond reminiscence takes place in 1984, and it sparks fond memories of \"the Camomile Lawn\" at the cliff-side home of Aunt Helena and Uncle Richard (Felicity Kendal and Paul Eddington, reunited from the hit Brit-comGood Neighbors), so named because its fresh scent is a reminder of happier times before the war. Among the five cousins whose lives are deeply affected by the war, the dramatic focus remains on young Sophy (superbly played by Rebecca Hall, and in later scenes by Claire Bloom) and the deliberately mercenary Calypso (Jennifer Ehle), who marries for money and finds love--or at least sex--with whomever she pleases while her husband's away in battle.For a series that features ample nudity, sexual indiscretions, and surprisingly frank treatments of alcoholism, adultery, and rape,The Camomile Lawnremains entirely respectable in the way it weaves passion and pain into a cohesive, engrossing drama, rich in humor and humanity while discreetly handling less savory aspects of its characters' behavior. Also featuring Claire Bloom and Tara Fitzgerald (Brassed Off) in one of her earliest starring roles, the series develops its characters so effectively that the emotional impact of the war becomes a powerful bond between them, and we experience their joys and sorrows as intensely as they do. Best of all, Taylor's teleplay is blessed by abundant wit and humor--the best defense against the melancholy of war--and director Peter Hall guides his stellar cast with impeccable attention to details of character and context. The result is a very satisfying and richly authentic portrait of privileged England on the brink of war and personal tragedy, imbued with a resilient richness of spirit. A screen-text biography of author Mary Wesley is included (she was already in her seventies when her first novel was published), along with cast and crew filmographies.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00HUAH14Q", "B00H4ZEFTQ", "B0007LFPJ8", "B00180IPQM", "B00HUAGYF8", "B00J3M54AW", "B005DVIPY4", "B007ISJS1O", "0099499142", "1569383634", "B00HGE90Z4", "B00D7AM2WO", "B00HUAGZ34", "B007A2O3FO", "B00BBXSP84", "B000FL7CBY", "0140108270", "B000784WKO", "B00BQXTCYK", "B00BOTCJXC", "0140108289", "B00GD7UO6E", "B00CLB7CFM", "B0074FUSFG", "B00BCXW106", "B008PDAENC", "B005GP7ELW", "B00005ALMM", "B0083HXKAY", "B004JMSIVI", "B00005JKKY", "B008KEQLZ6", "B00662CH02", "B000JLTS80", "B00JJRLFTU", "B00AATGDUC", "B004G7XCRQ", "B002V3AM6G", "B00D7AM2YW", "B001VB8U9U", "B000GIXLUC", "B00125WAU0", "B00FRQ0HOQ", "B00JFH8GZA", "B00IKM5OTW", "B00D49YDDY", "B005N8KP3Q", "B000ERVK6W", "B00HHYF5DE", "B00005JOA0", "B005DJ7AYC", "B00DC5K1FO", "B0000C23D5", "B00D49YDR0", "B00065GX96", "B00B5A9FNM", "B004HHX9H8", "0670873632", "B00D49YEHO", "B0011VJRVU", "B00GWXI20E", "B009L2EW5W", "B00GWXI2RM", "0140123938", "B00HHYF548", "B00GD7UMDO", "B00BQXTDIU", "B000F4RHC0", "B00005OBAL", "B00447G2NE", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00A8KJLPM", "B001BNFR76", "B00AQYUY5Q", "B009T6CXG0", "B003UD7J94", "0099513056", "B00D49YESS", "B00B83OIVA", "B009Z59ZNE", "B00FPPQYXM", "0671504614", "B0000SX9MS", "B000GYI3D6", "B00A0HT99G", "B00B62R9XM", "B0012OVCE6", "B000FQ4LDG", "B0009NZ76U", "0140108262", "B004FUKLG4", "B009YX8MKO", "B0097C046W", "B00G15MDI0", "B00GHH9I62", "B007701RFS", "B000M2E32M", "B00GPPXNIK", "B00ABMAIM2"], "bought_together": ["B00180IPQM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005DVIPY4", "0099499142", "B00005JOA0", "B00D7AM2WO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 73507}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 25.32, "brand": "Acorn", "asin": "B000EDWLTQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2BGM8xMioL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "CAMOMILE LAWN"}

{"description": "Volume 3 in theStar Trek Fan Collectiveseriesfocuses on the show's resident deity, Q, played with indignant mischief by John De Lancie.  While previousFan Collectiveshave taken votes to select which episodes around a certain theme would be included,Qmakes things easy (the characternevermade things easy) by simply including all 12 episodes (two are double-length) in which he appeared.  And because Q was especially fond of tormenting Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) and his crew, most of the episodes are fromThe Next Generation, including that series' first episode,Encounter at Farpoint.

{"description": "Subtitled \"A Sound Journey with Evelyn Glennie,\" German director Thomas Riedelsheimer's exquisiteTouch the Soundis nominally a portrait of the Scottish musician known as \"the first full-time solo percussionist.\" Glennie is certainly a fascinating subject. Profoundly deaf since childhood, she disdains the use of hearing aids and sign language, relying instead on lip reading and, more crucially, on the use of all of her senses, especially touch, to \"hear\" with her entire body. The film reveals Glennie's extraordinary skills in a variety of settings: playing a snare drum for bemused New Yorkers in cavernous Grand Central Station; improvising with guitarist Fred Frith in an empty warehouse in Cologne, Germany (their final vibes-guitar duet is one of the film's musical highlights); working with hearing-impaired students in her native Aberdeenshire; jamming with taiko drummers in Japan, and later delighting customers in a Tokyo bar with a spontaneous workout involving chopsticks, dishes, cans, and glassware (the woman can make music with virtually anything). But Riedelsheimer, who was also the film's editor and cinematographer, has a broader agenda here--namely, to intensify our awareness of the sounds that surround us everywhere, in every moment. From the streets of New York to the beaches of Santa Cruz, from the rocky Scottish coastline to a tranquil Japanese rock garden, he links heightened audio, as clear and natural as the best ECM recordings, to a succession of gorgeous visual images to create a balance of complex detail and overall sparseness, resulting in a kind of Zen feast. Even more of the same is found in a \"making of\" featurette that's the highlight of the bonus material, makingTouch the Soundeasily one of the most rewarding documentaries in recent years.--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000003EU4", "B0002JL9N6", "B000KJU1JG", "B000AMMSF8", "B0028X6KYW", "B0006O9MCM", "B000JBY13C", "B007N31YFW", "B005TTEFXK", "B000OCY66I", "B001GP5TPO", "B0044M2OSG", "B00005RIY3", "B00069I6PQ", "B001CDLATE", "B000BB1534", "B00BTYHBX0", "B005F9T674", "B0010B9BVW", "B000QXCPB8", "0091743052", "B006HC5VUY", "B000003FBE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000003EU4", "B0025Y963G", "B0006O9MCM", "B0028X6KYW"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 78381}, "asin": "B000F0UUSM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ACXRTK5GL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Touch the Sound - A Sound Journey With Evelyn Glennie"}

Babes are ogled; breasts are exposed; bald middle-aged men are mocked as buffoons; and both Depp and Morrow strip naked, revealing pale posteriors--and, in Depp's case, a scrawny physique that would mortify any contemporary teen star. While this can't be called one of Depp's more nuanced performances, his trademark bemused nonchalance is already present in larval form. Ironically, given Depp's later reputation for soulfulness, Morrow is the sincere one who yearns for a sweet young waitress, while Depp is the cad who runs after anything with breasts (he refers to quaaludes as \"the love drug\" and \"falls in love\"  with a girl who bends over in front of him in an aerobics class). Also featuring Andrew \"Dice\" Clay (The Adventures of  Ford Fairlane) and Leslie Easterbrook (beloved from thePolice Academyseries).  Discriminating cineastes will be happy to hear thatPrivate Resorthas been letterboxed, so the full frame of every shot can be fully appreciated.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005R87R", "B00000IRE6", "B00003CXRG", "B002AT4JN8", "B001I04QCO", "B000F7CECK", "B002AT4JNI", "B001A50716", "B0000VD04M", "B00049QJBG", "B004P7CNC2", "B0009XRZKQ", "0780628551", "B005FQ2H9Q", "B005XB8T68", "B003CMGE2Q", "B0000WN140", "0780621611", "B001HN69AY", "B002DQSKMY", "B006ISJQ1W", "B003XKNGNM", "B0009UZG0K", "B000053VAZ", "B000NQRR1Q", "B00004XPPB", "B00006JDU8", "B000GETUDI", "B000096FUD", "B005TMXZ0Q", "B003K2G0TA", "B00EVIOWUG", "B000N2HDJQ", "0780630890", "0783229526", "079284646X", "B004SIP7PS", "B000OYCMLW", "B002MWI7XG", "B0002234LS", "B00AEBB9F0", "B0009IOR6Q", "B008R65Y28", "B000PMFRYC", "B000PMFRZ6", "B00BQK4XUQ", "B000AQ69YU", "B00505E4MA", "B004A8ZWSS", "B001EZE5BU", "B003QSG9OE", "B00013WWT8", "B000FBFYTQ", "B002QEHPQU", "B003KUSUM2", "B005FQ2HEQ", "B00441GYQ0", "B004SIP6BI", "B001Q8MMBK", "B0031B97H2", "B003H5WF3U", "B002VYV60Q", "B0080GTAIY", "B00AEBBA72", "B001Q8MMD8", "B004HHX9OQ", "B005LS4MQE", "B006M3M5FM", "B000H5TH1Q", "B00J5JSV3A", "B00402FGAS", "B0000C3I96", "B0007W6HVM", "B00064LJW8", "B00AEBB9DW", "B00003CXWV", "B00005AVS9", "B00ESZZOMM", "B00094ARRI", "B009R68H80", "B001EDFSIQ", "B00JDOQMH4", "B007V6ON9A", "B009R68HFI", "B00AEBBAEK", "B003FP0XAY", "B00009OWJU", "B003BGZ618", "B0000A98ZO", "B00004STH1", "B0017UOU30", "B000BYA4IS", "B00005RYL4", "B003VOVW0O", "B00AEFYXD6", "B006UKX6GO", "B000C3L27U", "B00FB349R6", "B008QE9XD2", "B00009IB18"], "bought_together": ["B00005R87R"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002AT4JN8", "B0000VD04M", "B002DQSKMY", "B004P7CNC2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 98594}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000FDEV3Y", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EQYDW26RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Private Resort"}
{"description": "InThe Big White, a failing Alaskan travel agent hopes he's found the answer to his problems when a couple of thugs leave a dead body in a dumpster outside his business. The lack of a body has prevented Paul Barnell (Robin Williams,The Birdcage,One Hour Photo) from claiming his missing brother's life insurance. Unfortunately, the thugs who dumped the body in the first place (Tim Blake Nelson,O Brother, Where Art Thou?, and W. Earl Brown,Deadwood) want it back, so they kidnap Barnell's wife (Holly Hunter,Raising Arizona), who may or may not have Tourette's Syndrome. Meanwhile, an obsessive insurance agent (Giovanni Ribisi,Saving Private Ryan) smells something fishy and thinks he's found the case that will get him and his phone psychic girlfriend (Alison Lohman,White Oleander) transferred to warmer climes, and Barnell's long-missing brother (Woody Harrelson,White Men Can't Jump) returns, a bit perturbed to learn he's dead.The Big Whitesuffers from an overload of quirkiness--phone psychics, Tourette's, and possibly gay hit men are a lot of whimsy for one movie--but the actors commit themselves to their roles with gusto.

{"description": "A disturbing film about a young Belgian couple and their newborn child,L'Enfanttells a heartbreaking tale that is less about love than about the possibility of moral redemption. We quickly learn what kind of people Sonia and Bruno are. Sonia (Deborah Francois) is a sweet teenager who has just given birth to Bruno's (Jeremie Renier) child. Instead of visiting her and seeing their baby in the hospital, Bruno sublets her apartment to \"friends\" who slam the door in her face when she tries to return home. We do not know what Sonia does for a living, but we know she's diligent enough to maintain a small apartment and keep her pantry stocked with instant soup. Bruno, on the other hand, refuses to take a job. Instead, he leads a gang of thieves who're approximately half his age (and height). Still, Sonia loves him. And Bruno, who may be incapable of love, enjoys the carefree benefits of having a girlfriend who doesn't expect too much. All this changes when Bruno does the unthinkable--he sells their child. He calmly explains to her, \"I thought we'd have another.\" Overnight, Sonia changes from a little girl to a bitter woman who no longer excuses Bruno's behavior. When he returns to her apartment claiming he loves her, she spits back, \"You're lying. You can't help it.\" Not realizing the irony of his own actions, he then begs her for money. Renier and Francois are formidable actors who convey feelings with subtle nuances. Though the film is in French, the viewer never feels lost. The subtitles certainly help, but the actors are so good that their intonations and expressions speak volumes themselves.L'Enfant--a 2005 Cannes winner by filmmaking brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne--is a brutal film to watch not because of any gore or violence, but because of the frailty of the characters and their desperation to survive. In his quest to return the child to Sonia, Bruno attempts to become a better human being. But the viewer is never left with the satisfaction of knowing that he will ever be able to truly redeem himself.--Jae-Ha Kim", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002U6DVOY", "B0001JXP16", "B0083V2VZ0", "B0083V2W18", "B00AIBZLHS", "B00A8QDI1Y", "B0083V2VXC", "B00HVOFP6W", "B002BWP4A6", "B00151QYE4", "B00000F7E6", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B00K0MM4AM", "B00A8QDHUQ", "B0001EFUFK", "B0000C9JFO", "B000I8OOG0", "B0087OULO6", "B00092ZLEY", "B00GPPXNLC", "B00HE010QM", "B00IGK6TH4", "B00AIBZLR8", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B00HE011DE", "B00HRJVHEK", "B00009OOFG", "B000B9EYFW", "B0083V2W54", "B004Q0CHB0", "B002AG2NTI", "B009VO9XSG", "B0084O26SI", "B000YAA68W", "B00006ADG1", "B002BWP3UC", "B0002KQOH6", "B000P6R9NK", "B0036TGTDO", "B002AFX53C", "B00002RAPT", "B00080Z53O", "B00005JKJA", "B0035ECHIG", "B003ICZW7S", "B001152TL6", "B00GPPXP6A", "B00005UK01", "B0000B1A5P", "B00002VWE0", "B0036TGSJE", "B000059TON", "B0000C2IQP", "B00023P4N8", "B0006GAOJA", "6305362688", "B00HVOFP9O", "B000PKG6O4", "0780618564", "B00HVOFP08", "B00HXH00ZI", "B00005N8A9", "B0007OCG5G", "B0041KKYF6", "B001MPS7GG", "B004SUDQ22", "B00003CXKS", "B000296E7W", "B005MXQD74", "B00HB3AP9A", "0767812158", "B002E2M5IC", "6305744114", "0671604295", "B00005J75R", "B00AZNEVNE", "B00GPPXNIK", "B000OVLBGC", "B000I8OMEY", "B00FGVRZOM", "B0002DB52M", "B00007J5VT", "B00005JL57", "B00009MEA0", "B0029O0BK4", "B0077E8RFC", "B00GA9F2PI", "B00421IR5I", "B001QFYCZM", "B00FGVRZR4", "0231163290", "B008CJ0JS4", "B000A5044C", "B00004TBFS", "B00005M2C7", "6305081034", "B0054QHHHE", "B006TTC5MM", "B001EOQCMG"], "bought_together": ["B002U6DVOY", "B0001JXP16"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00A8QDI1Y", "B001THZAAI", "B0083V2W18", "B00151QYE4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 123246}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.99, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000G0O5IM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519ND3S0K4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "L'enfant (The Child)"}
{"description": "The sixth and final season of HBO's prison dramaOz--which aired in 2003--is brutal, passionate, and gritty. Compellingly addictive with taut storylines and superb acting, each of the eight episodes on this 3-disc set nicely paves the way for the series finale, which wraps the show up in a satisfying (and surprising) manner. Often told through the eyes (and voice) of deceased prisoner Augustus Hill (Harold Perrineau,Lost),Ozisn't an easy show to watch. Inmates are routinely raped, tortured, and killed--not out of need, but out of boredom and cruelty. And in a corrupt system where too few bureaucrats actually care about these men's lives, few are willing to do anything about it. Those that do give a damn--Sister Peter Marie (Rita Moreno,West Side Story), Father Mukada (B.D. Wong,Law & Order: Special Victims Unit), Dr. Nathan (Lauren Velez), Warden Glynn (Ernie Hudson), McManus (Terry Kinney)--face an uphill battle.One of the strongest storylines is the ongoing romance between murderer Keller (Christopher Meloni,Law & Order: SVUand Beecher (Lee Tergesen), who's hoping to be paroled. Series creator Tom Fontana doesn't allow their arc to be diluted by any idealistic expectations. The viewer is acutely aware that Beecher is an easy target for annihilation whether or not he is released from prison. The viewer is never quite as certain of Keller's motives--whether they're borne of love and affection, or a selfish need to satisfy his own primal urges. Like Beecher, Alvarez (Kirk Acevedo) is trying to keep his own nose clean in the hopes that he'll be eligible for parole three years down the line. It's easy to understand the almost suffocating feeling he lives every day, knowing that three years may as well be a lifetime when you're behind bars and the target of both your former gang and the Aryan brothers, led by Schillinger (J.K. Simmons,Law & Order: SVU, theSpider-Manfilms). And Ryan (Dean Winters) desperately tries to save his mentally retarded brother Cyril (played by Dean's real-life sibling Scott William Winters) from being executed.There are a few subplots that don't ring true, such as the quasi romance between a librarian (Patti LuPone) and one of the prisoners, and an elderly inmate's (Joey Grey) implausible death wish. And for all the constraints the majority of convicts face, some appear to have almost free run of the prison. Still, Fontana has created a vivid, dark world where the occasional acts of humanity are as important as the non-stop chaos that is Oz. While it certainly helps to have seen the previous five seasons of the series to enjoy this season, it's not mandatory. These last eight episodes work fine as a stand-alone piece of drama.--Jae-Ha Kim", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009GV9E6", "B00031TYBC", "B0000Y40PW", "B00000FBH2", "B00005Y6YJ", "0060521333", "B00A2JP6V2", "B000QXDJLI", "B00123BY6S", "B00316DDYA", "B0007R4SWM", "B004YOEDR4", "B00G4EWNCO", "B000FTCLSU", "B0001KL5DA", "B0006IUD9Y", "B0002ERXC2", "B00G4EWJ1O", "B0015TX2LO", "B005NFJAWG", "B000067S1G", "B000UX6TK2", "B005SEDI5M", "B00EEDNR9A", "B00HW3EXCE", "B0013FSL16", "0783230338", "B002FLOTPE", "B0007YMVWO", "B0020TS5EM", "B00B52F278", "B001PQZYQI", "B00DJYJRHG", "B0060MYKYY", "B0009NZ2W4", "B004BZ5AHI", "B00EIL7E9C", "B0001O3YLM", "B003PIUBZS", "B003CN5SAY", "B0015I2S7E", "B007TBIUSM", "B002AMVEDI", "B0012CJQZ0", "B00FYL08RK", "B00008PW1F", "B002AMVED8", "B00ADQPB50", "B008PJZDXW", "B00C8CQRQ4", "B00003CXOP", "B0002I84JO", "B000EHSVMS", "B00005NOHO", "B001AQBGM4", "B004YM6JSW", "B00F9F1K8W", "B00DXP7L88", "B002XUL6RG", "B0024FAD9C", "B0009IW88K", "B002N57KGM", "B003XWEQ8E", "B000V86OKG", "B000Q6GUW0", "B00166UFSY", "B000002MUG", "B0036TGTF2", "B0012CJQYQ", "B000FFJYE8", "B0024FAD92", "B0055SNHQG", "B00005JNOG", "B00GST8PHW", "B0092Q82LC", "B003UD7J6W", "B0032JTV6A", "B0058YPG1G", "B0015ABRE2", "B00FEP9MYG", "B003L77GRO", "B000NVT0UM", "B00HI4EGQA", "B0024FAR4I", "B00HQVB0Q4", "B0089J2926", "B006CR2OOA", "B00124ONGA", "B007HOQ5FQ", "B00915G6WQ", "B003L77GTC", "B009TE9GNK", "B00JF5G8WU", "B00021R7E4", "B000FS9MY2", "B00HUCF6KK", "B001KKU9D2", "B0012CJQY6", "B0042L0OFY"], "bought_together": ["B0009GV9E6", "B00031TYBC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000Y40PW", "B00000FBH2", "B00005Y6YJ", "B0009GV9E6"]}, "price": 22.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 44664}, "asin": "B000G1R4TS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-AjbLxssL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Oz: Season 6"}

{"description": "Crack open a beer, grab your remote control and gorge yourself on an extra-large helping of bad behavior, British style. Whether making viewers chuckle or chunder, Men Behaving Badly undeniably and unapologetically became the British sitcom of the 1990s, rivaled perhaps only by Absolutely Fabulous.

A proud couple's bundle of joy is really a newborn terror in filmmaker Larry Cohen's cautionary cult hit that tapped into environmental fears.

{"description": "Sweet baby Jesus, we thank you for blessing Will Ferrell and Adam McKay with the talent to create a NASCAR comedy as hilarious asTalladega Nights. The so-called \"Ballad of Ricky Bobby\" is hardly flawless  in fact it's not always firing on all cylinders  but with comedy star Ferrell and director McKay still hot from the success of their previous comedy hitAnchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, most of this 108-minute spoof of oval-track racing is so knee-slappin' funny that you can't help but surrender to the stupidity.Obviously, Ferrell's the shining star, and his portrayal of lead-footed pit-crew-member-turned-#1 NASCAR champion Ricky \"I Wanna Go Fast\" Bobby (how can you not love that name?) is spot-on perfect, righteously spoofing the entirety of NASCAR culture without insulting its oft-ridiculed roots in redneck bootlegging of a bygone era. You could even argue that Talladega Nights is truer to NASCAR than Tom Cruise'sDays of Thunder, and it's certainly more entertaining, especially when you add John C. Reilly as Ricky's life-long pal, teammate, and eventual rival Cal Naughton, Jr. (together they're nicknamed \"Shake 'n Bake\"), and Sacha Baron Cohen (fromDa Ali G ShowandBorat) as gay French \"Formula Un\" driver-turned NASCAR rival Jean Girrard, to a stellar cast including Molly Shannon, Greg Germann, Amy Adams and Michael Clarke Duncan.Sure, it's mostly a showcase for Ferrell's loud, over-the-top antics and nonsensical non sequiturs (like cameo appearances by Elvis Costello and Mos Def), but with Ferrell behind the wheel,Talladega Nightsrolls into victory lane with fuel to spare, and there's one final bit of comedy (with a tip of the hat to William Faulkner) for those who sit through the credits. --Jeff ShannonStills fromTalladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby(click for larger image)More NASCAR andTalladega Nightsat Amazon.comThe CalendarOn blu-rayNASCAR on PSPOur NASCAR StoreNASCAR The Imax ExperienceSpeed, Guts, and GloryBookOther Will Ferrell FilmsAnchor ManElfThe Best of Will FerrellMore Films by Will Ferrell", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000WZEZFY", "B001G5T6H6", "B000HRMCTI", "B0007TS24U", "B0009K7RT8", "B00096S49O", "B000EJ9VDY", "B000KF0GSQ", "B000OVLBFI", "B000AM8RQM", "B000SH3XCM", "B00000G02A", "B001F76PDI", "B000ELL1P8", "B000A6QMQA", "B002EQFXZA", "B000L2125O", "B0009Z3LGQ", "B000ASBKHE", "B0009NSDCK", "B000FIS7HK", "B0007TFLLM", "B0012IWO08", "B002SD94AY", "B003L51GW2", "B0007V46JI", "B000ASDFGS", "B000IFRT5G", "B0008JFMEW", "B000GPVUMG", "B000AQ6904", "B002BSC57U", "B0009VCSXW", "B0008JFMF6", "B000R3BN4M", "B007M6W36Y", "B000BYRCHE", "B0009RCPV6", "B000E1YW04", "B002I0GZBI", "B0009X7BFA", "B000B5IP6U", "B0009KQOME", "B000A0GP5Y", "B000ENUYFE", "B0050JN84Q", "B000BGZRTC", "B003DS4Z6Q", "B001KMRN0M", "B000G8O0MU", "B000EWBKU8", "B0047ERZ7Q", "B000KKRD2S", "B00168PFFK", "B00311G2DY", "B00083G5CG", "B002BS47WG", "B0007Z2556", "B0009FU10U", "B000B8IA4E", "B0045SE9XC", "B000AAJTM0", "B0019C6KAC", "B000F2DE8S", "B0011VPYIK", "B0009350CQ", "B0009NJFPY", "B000ADWD2A", "B000FYZS6M", "B000VIUNZI", "B000AQ690Y", "B0009WPZPY", "B003ALEWKU", "B000F4PDEO", "B000A7Q1XI", "B000803BQM", "B0009K7RTI", "B000MNP2KS", "B000NIBUQW", "B000BKJ76C", "B0013KPSDA", "B007ZH9OFI", "B000059TMB", "B002TPTDFC", "B000A3XYE6", "B00151QYU8", "B000F5GJO6", "B0009VRHME", "B0009W5JAA", "B0009RCPXE", "B000BW7QV8", "B0009NSE42", "B001IZNIVE", "B000BYRCRO", "B000B5IOVQ", "B000B5IOW0", "B00083FZH2"], "bought_together": ["B000WZEZFY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001G5T6GW", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00B65JMEI", "B00AEFXJS6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 199481}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.5, "brand": "Son", "asin": "B000J3OTO6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MwbfwtGuL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Talladega Nights - The Ballad of Ricky Bobby [UMD for PSP]"}
{"description": "The Celestine Prophecyis an action-adventure adaptation of the hit novel by James Redfield, a film that moves so swiftly it can be difficult at times to absorb the New Age philosophy tucked into Redfield's multiple, so-called Insights. Matthew Settle plays an American history teacher who travels to Peru to look into the discovery of an ancient manuscript that foretells the arrival of a new spirituality. The Peruvian government and Catholic church, threatened by something that might supplant traditional religion and mainstream values, harass and arrest the scientists and enlightened souls who discovered the manuscript. Our hero becomes involved in a dangerous effort to keep the document from official hands; along the way, he's introduced to the prophecy's major principles, which arouse his dormant spiritual abilities. Annabeth Gish, Hector Elizondo, and Jurgen Prochnow are a welcome presence in this light and sometimes confusing, if casually engaging work that requires repeat viewings to fully hear its interesting message.--Tom KeoghMoreCelestine Prophecyon Amazon.comPhilosophy, Hollywood Style: Films for Fans ofThe Celestine ProphecyThe Making ofThe Celestine ProphecyThe Novels of James RedfieldStills fromThe Celestine Prophecy(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000K7VHY6", "B000QEIOSU", "B005U0ZP46", "B00CVDPCKM", "B00BBZDVQS", "158270399X", "0446674575", "0446676489", "0446671002", "0446671223", "B0096BTXV6", "B0006UEVQ8", "0446519081", "0446523089", "B005LYLP8Q", "B0044M2OS6", "0446675237", "B000NO1XHW", "B002XFDKUM", "B00007GZR5", "0981458971", "B002GZFG4W", "0446912069", "044651862X", "B006ECDV68", "B000003ACR", "1582704147", "B002LZW1AY", "B000K8LV1O", "B003UN6JNQ", "B00A801CJU", "B000A0GY28", "B005WL3QBW", "0060833025", "B0006ZXJ3O", "B001P729XI", "B00BDJKDHC", "0688166253", "0446522740", "B00FTE5R4G", "0446523941", "B0015SBNCA", "0915811405", "B000Y04R96", "B0011Z5NN2", "1932073213", "B00895CM5O", "0915811936", "B0093BFCWI", "B004K4FUNO", "1932073205", "1932073493", "1565116429", "B00H6QHCWA", "B0014BQR7E", "B001QWFTUM", "1401926339", "B002NZK5UK", "1401912443", "0593066979", "1401939147", "0981536328", "0446672998", "B004OOQMIC", "B00443YDWK", "630542845X", "0399142789", "1401944086", "1401945074", "B000E6ES94", "1401904505", "B004JOBTRQ", "B003CJXJ8Q", "B001T46TCO", "1582702152", "1577314867", "1939410002", "B00443XONE", "1401943853", "1401903568", "B001PSOCRS", "0812995589", "1577311329", "091581160X", "B0039TD7WC", "B0045HCIY0", "B000S76VHQ", "B005ZOFJNE", "B000EPFCN6", "6305428360", "B00008L3SE", "B00B1WAW9A", "1401944051", "B00KDK64DY", "0876045131", "B00005JPAR", "1932073256", "1401940676"], "bought_together": ["B000QEIOSU", "B005U0ZP46"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0446671002", "B005U0ZP46", "B00CVDPCKM", "158270399X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14969}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.67, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000JBWWQ0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PK6ERP1VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Celestine Prophecy"}
{"description": "Recently restored by the UCLA Film Archive, Kenneth Anger's difficult-to-see early films are finally collected here onto DVD, alongside optional fascinating commentary by Anger himself. Scores of Anger fans have previously persevered through horrid rented VHS copies of these films, due to their inimitable beauty and strangeness. Anger is renowned for filmic experimentation that portrays invented occult or druggy subcultures while formally rejecting conventions of blockbuster filmmaking. As a result, he has also become the unofficial godfather of the music video, for his groundbreaking use of soundtracks that, in these early films at least, meld classical music with '50s bubble gum pop and '60s folk for a hypnotic, psychedelic effect.Fireworksis a monumental film credited as gay cinema's first masterpiece. Rabbit's Moon, presented in its original 16-minute version, andEaux d'Artificeare Anger's two other brilliant black-and-white studies of European culture, namely Miming and the 17th century art of Water Fountains. Anger's commentary reveals directorial secrets, for example thatEaux d'Artifice'sblack-and-white appearance is tromp l'oeil that involved both manipulation of the camera and film development to heighten the film's metaphoric notion of artifice.Puce Moment, starring Yvonne Marquis, is a colorful, campy tribute to silent film glamour, in which the star debates what gown to wear for a party.Inauguration of the Pleasure Domeis the first Anger film to investigate mythology in relation to Aleister Crowley's witchcraft, subject matter that consumed Anger in consequent projects. Kenneth Anger's films exist in a timeless, stylized void that is both alluring and terrifying. Watching these selections will prove that Anger's aesthetic contributions to cinema are noticeable fifty years later.--Trinie Dalton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000UAE7QS", "B000087EYF", "B0039A9MCK", "B000NY1E9E", "B001NFNFJY", "B00393SFPW", "B0009PW450"], "bought_together": ["B000087EYF"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0039A9MCK", "B000UAE7QS", "1907317511", "0440153255"]}, "price": 49.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 249627}, "asin": "B000JFXRU6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41gz9MVoPwL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Films of Kenneth Anger 1"}
{"description": "First screened in Europe and scheduled for limited release in the U.S.,The Illusionistoffers welcome proof that \"arthouse\" quality needn't be limited to the arthouses. Set in turn-of-the-century Vienna, this stately, elegant period film benefited from a crossover release in mainstream cinemas, and showed considerable box-office staying power--granted, teenage mallrats and lusty males may have been drawn to the allure ofSeventh Heavenalumna Jessica Biel, who rises to the occasion with a fine performance. But there's equal appeal in the casting of Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti, who bring their formidable talents to bear on the intriguing tale of a celebrated magician named Eisenheim (Norton) whose stage performance offends the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), a vindictive lout who aims to marry Duchess Sophie (Biel), Eisenheim's childhood friend and now, 15 years later, his would-be lover. This romantic rivalry and Eisenheim's increasingly enigmatic craft of illusion are investigated by Chief Inspector Uhl (Giamatti), who's under Leopold's command and is therefore not to be trusted as Eisenheim and Sophie draw closer to their inevitable reunion. Cleverly adapted by director Neil Burger from Steven Millhauser's short story \"Eisenheim the Illusionist,\" and boasting exquisite production values and a fine score by Philip Glass,The Illusionistis the kind of class act that fully deserved its unusually wide and appreciative audience. --Jeff ShannonBeyondThe Illusionist\"Eisenheim the Illusionist\" and Other StoriesPaul Giamatti in a More Loveable RoleMagic Kits & AccessoriesStills fromThe Illusionist", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000LC55F2", "B000NOIX48", "B002ZG980U", "B002WNU0QW", "B00DWZHTOU", "B001MZ5W3M", "B00011CZRE", "B000H0MKI8", "B00008K7AO", "B000L212HC", "B00AEBB8NI", "B000GFLKF8", "B000O76ZO4", "B00003CXZ4", "B00005JLSB", "B000FKO5QK", "B000M341QE", "B00AEFXGIY", "B00005V9HH", "B00AEBB8LA", "B00005JMOW", "B00096S49Y", "0767847415", "6305313687", "B004SIP9Z6", "B0047T74CM", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000R4SMCW", "B0002YLCG0", "B000P0J0EW", "B000HEWEE4", "B0041KKYHE", "B00BBI7EZY", "B00AEBBA2W", "B000CQLZ0Q", "0783235070", "0767802519", "B002ZG997C", "B00003CXHG", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000069HZP", "B004SIP7PS", "B003ASLJQI", "B00177Y9ZC", "B00005JLKN", "B003ZW9H68", "B001N44BVQ", "B002O3Z50Q", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005JN2Z", "B00AEBB86A", "B00000F4ZY", "B000MZHW40", "0671686402", "B00BB67UNW", "B005HP2J0M", "B000QXDED6", "B000NIVJF4", "B001F12J0C", "B000N6TX1I", "B000LAZE8C", "B00080ZG10", "B005LAIGRS", "B0009MDPYM", "0792159659", "B000OYC7BW", "B001UV4XGU", "B004AOECXI", "0767818105", "B000XR9L50", "B0018O4YT0", "B00015YVDG", "B004SIP8JI", "B00004XPPG", "B00006ZXSK", "B001DHXT20", "B0000AC8LR", "B009B8YMB0", "0783229402", "B0006210ZG", "B001PPGAIA", "B00004BZIY", "B008JFURII", "B00005JPAR", "B00006ADFM", "B004SIP7TE", "B000F5GNX8", "B000FS9FCG", "B006P0FIGU", "B00005JMCN", "B002VWNID6", "B004XQO90O", "B004EPZ084", "B00AEBB9M8", "B000P5FH3K", "B00005JNY3", "B000063US3", "B003L20IG0"], "bought_together": ["B000LC55F2", "B002ZG980U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000LC55F2", "B005LAIHXQ", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00DV2MVWO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 60145}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B000K7VHPU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nYghoS63L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Illusionist (Full Screen Edition)"}

{"description": "Marketing aside,Crossoveris more concerned with off-court melodrama than on-court action. Tech (Anthony Mackie,Half Nelson) and Noah (Wesley Jonathan,Roll Bounce) are best friends and streetball stars. Their base of operations is the Detroit of8 MileandFour Brothers. Tech, who has a record, just wants to get his GED and make a decent living, while Noah plans to use his college scholarship to become a doctor. Their lives take a turn when Vaughn (Wayne Brady in a rare dramatic turn), a sports agent-turned-promoter, leans on Noah to defer his dream and turn pro. Vaughn pays his b-ball team to play, but that doesn't mean, of course, that he actually cares about his players. To him, it's business. Along the way, Tech gets involved with Eboni (promising newcomer Alecia Fears) and Noah with her social-climbing friend, Vanessa (America's Next Top ModelEva Pigford, who should probably stick with the catwalk), who used to go with their arch-rival Jewelz (real-life streetball player Phillip \"Hot Sauce\" Champion). Just as the movie questions whether the men's friendship is built to last, it questions whether their romantic entanglements are the real deal. Writer/director Preston A. Whitmore II shootsCrossoverlike a rap video. The post-production effects are flashy, but there isn't a lot of substance behind the style. Mackie and Jonathan, however, get the job done. The film may be formulaic, but their natural charisma makes it worth watching. Just be forewarned that there isn't much roundball playing going on here. --Kathleen C.

{"description": "It takes a certain kind of comic genius to create a character who is, to quote the classic Sondheim lyric, appealing and appalling. But be forewarned:Boratis not \"something for everyone.\" It arrives as advertised as one of the most outrageous, most offensive, and funniest films in years. Kazakhstan journalist Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen reprising the popular character from hisDa Ali G Show), leaves his humble village to come to \"U.S. and A\" to film a documentary. After catching an episode ofBaywatchin his New York hotel room, he impulsively scuttles his plans and, accompanied by his fat,hirsute producer (Hardy to his Laurel), proceeds to California to pursue the object of his obsession, Pamela Anderson.Boratis not about how he finds America; it's about how America finds him in a series of increasingly cringe-worthy scenes. Borat, with his '70s mustache, well-worn grey suit, and outrageously backwards attitudes (especially where Jews are concerned) interacts with a cross-section of the populace, catching them, a la Alan Funt onCandid Camera, in the act of being themselves. Early on, an unwitting humor coach advises Borat about various types of jokes. Borat asks if his brother's retardation is a ripe subject for comedy. The coach patiently replies, \"That would not be funny in America.\" NOT! Borat is subversively, bracingly funny. When it comes to exploring uncharted territory of what is and is not appropriate or politically correct, Borat knows no boundaries, as when he brings a fancy dinner with the southern gentry to a halt after returning from the bathroom with a bag of his feces (\"The cultural differences are vast,\" his hostess graciously/patronizingly offers), or turns cheers to boos at a rodeo when he calls for bloodlust against the Iraqis and mangles \"The Star Spangled Banner.\"Success, John F. Kennedy once said, has a thousand fathers. A paternity test onBoratmight reveal traces of Bill Dana's Jose Jimenez, Andy Kaufman, Michael Moore,The Jamie Kennedy Xperiment, andJackass. Some scenes seem to have been staged (a game Anderson, whom Borat confronts at a book signing, was reportedly in on the setup), but others, as the growing litany of lawsuits attests, were not. All too real is Borat's encounter with loutish Southern frat boys who reveal their sexism and racism, and the disturbing moment when he asks a gun store owner what gun he would recommend to \"kill a Jew\" (a Glock automatic is the matter-of-fact reply). Comedy is not pretty, and inBoratit can get downright ugly, as when Borat and his producer get jiggly with it during a nude fight that spills out from their hotel room into the hallway, elevator, lobby and finally, a mortgage brokers association banquet. High-five! --Donald LiebensonOn the DVD\"Global Visitings\" capturesBorat-mania in all its hype and glory, as Sacha Baron Cohen, never breaking character, promotes his film around the world. On the itinerary isLate Night with Conan O'Brienand the Toronto Film Festival, a now-legendary screening aborted after a projector malfunction. A mixed bag of deleted scenes finds Borat trying to bait more unsuspecting citizens, including an animal-control worker who refuses Borat a dog after he asks, \"How do you recommend I cook this?\" and a doctor who is nonplussed by Borat's obscene medical history. A supermarket visit offers the most maddening fromage-inspired looniness since Monty Python's \"Cheese Shop\" sketch. Also good for a few chuckles are a faux soundtrack commercial and aBaywatchparody (\"Sexydangerwatch\").--Donald LiebensonBeyondBoratAll things Sacha Baron CohenBoratApparelBoratSoundtrackStills fromBorat(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002P7UCJ0", "B005LAIHGI", "B0002ZMITY", "B002OID4WM", "B00020X852", "B000A88ESW", "B000WZEZGI", "B001G5T6GW", "B005LAIHHC", "B00AEFZ8OY", "B002P7UCJA", "B00005JNZU", "B001DPHDB0", "B001J9KJ4I", "B00G2P79BU", "B000J4QW8Q", "B00AEFYS2M", "B00005JMYI", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B0006GANPA", "B001OD4S50", "6305922756", "B003XJABTK", "B00AEBBA2C", "B008R65XNS", "B000BKVQS4", "B00AEBB9K0", "B003CRM6PA", "B000A7DVR2", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B0016MOV92", "B000BKJ762", "B00009W5CA", "B000AP04L0", "B008220BGQ", "B002T9H2LA", "B00068WOH8", "0385523467", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00008975Z", "B004SIP95G", "B00003CXZ1", "0783229526", "B002ZG99N6", "B003VPX5Y4", "B002SJIO4A", "B00005JLQN", "B00AEFY854", "B00005O3VC", "B004XVMCH6", "B000K7VHQE", "B0006HBZEW", "B00005JMUA", "B000VE439Y", "B00AEFXDO6", "B000EMGJAO", "B0000A02TZ", "B00005JNBQ", "B003Y5H5B0", "B00BEIYMZ6", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000MCH5RM", "B000K7VHOG", "B00005ALS0", "B001UV4X8S", "B00009MGEM", "B0001Z4OXS", "B000C20VPA", "B0012IWNZY", "B00CE00ZV8", "B00005QCVX", "B000I0RNVQ", "B000022TSW", "B001TOD92C", "B000P0J09M", "B00005JL78", "B00AEFYAMA", "B00AEFXGIY", "B000J4P9P8", "B000055Y0X", "B004EPZ084", "B001VLBDD0", "B00AEFY5B6", "B006XZWAWM", "B00005JKMN", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000XFVIOO", "B002GSXKOW", "B00006G8HR", "B000HT386M", "B000MQCUJG", "B00007AJF7", "B00005KA6V", "B004SIP9MY", "B00AEBBA72", "B00018D42W", "B000TZJBPQ", "B0009HBPN0", "B004P9UWM8"], "bought_together": ["B005LAIHGI", "B002P7UCJ0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005LAIHGI", "B000WZEZGI", "B002OID4WM", "B000TZJBPQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15271}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.29, "brand": "COHEN,SACHA BARON", "asin": "B000MMMT9G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51uGbGa68JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"}
