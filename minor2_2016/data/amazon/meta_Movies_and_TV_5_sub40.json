{"description": "Anybody who has written him off because of his string of stinkers--or anybody who's too young to rememberThe Goodbye Girl--may be shocked at the accomplishment and nuance of Richard Dreyfuss's performance inClose Encounters of the Third Kind. Here, he plays a man possessed; contacted by aliens, he (along with other members of the \"chosen\") is drawn toward the site of the incipient landing: Devil's Tower, in rural Wyoming. As in many Spielberg films, there are no personalized enemies; the struggle is between those who have been called and a scientific establishment that seeks to protect them by keeping them away from the arriving spacecraft. The ship, and the special effects in general, are every bit as jaw-dropping on the small screen as they were in the theater (well, almost). Released in 1977 as a cerebral alternative to the swashbuckling science fiction epics then in vogue,Close Encountersnow seems almost wholesome in its representation of alien contact and interested less in philosophizing about extraterrestrials than it is in examining the nature of the inner \"call.\" Ultimately a motion picture about the obsession of the driven artist or determined visionary,Close Encounterscomes complete with the stock Spielberg wives and girlfriends who seek to tether the dreamy, possessed protagonists to the more mundane concerns of the everyday. So a spectacular, seminal motion picture indeed, but one with gender politics that are all too terrestrial.--Miles Bethany", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304143184", "0783231482", "6300182355", "6303506291", "6303212263", "B00005B238", "6300214060", "0790736233", "0783216084", "6303148352", "B00006AL1C", "6300268993", "6304508611", "0767825411", "6300183971", "6304509154", "6301300556", "6301670124", "6305363668", "B0000A36J1", "B000059HFB", "6300181286", "6300247236", "B00004RV8M", "B0000048TX", "B00000JQSV", "B00000JXVM", "B00000JGEK"], "bought_together": ["6304143184"], "also_viewed": ["B0087F7VSY", "6304143184", "6301792734", "B00000ILE6", "0783226152", "6301966732", "B00BBND56G"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 557907}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "", "asin": "076780192X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511NY005RKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Close Encounters of the Third Kind (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}
{"description": "For all of its conventional plotting about an obsessive-compulsive curmudgeon (Jack Nicholson) who improves his personality at the urging of his gay neighbor (Greg Kinnear) and a waitress (Helen Hunt) who inspires his best behavior, this is one of the sharpest Hollywood comedies of the 1990s. Nicholson could play his role in his sleep (the Oscar he won should have gone to Robert Duvall forThe Apostle), but his mischievous persona is precisely necessary to give heart to his seemingly heartless character, who is of all things a successful romance novelist. As a single mom with a chronically asthmatic young son, Hunt gives the film its conscience and integrity (along with plenty of wry humor), and she also won an Oscar for her wonderful performance. Greg Kinnear had to settle for an Oscar nomination (while cowriter-director James L. Brooks was inexplicably snubbed by Oscar that year), but his work was also singled out in the film's near-unanimous chorus of critical praise. It's questionable whether a romance between Hunt and the much older Nicholson is entirely believable, but this movie's smart enough--and charmingly funny enough--to make it seem endearingly possible.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001AVZA8", "B000YAF4MA", "0800141741", "B004FQX5B6", "B0000YEEGM", "B0038N9WKU", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00AEBB9WI", "B00005JLSK", "0783226845", "B0000AOV4I", "B000YDBPAM", "B000XJD33O", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00081U7HC", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00003CXFV", "B001ECDVK4", "6305212112", "B000EHRVOW", "B00009Y3PV", "6304765266", "B00004RJ73", "B005F2JRUC", "0783225733", "B00AEFXYOA", "6305236569", "B000OCZA04", "B000FFJYBG", "B003ASLJK4", "0792833198", "B000JYW5B4", "B00012QLB4", "B00BTYRB3U", "B0043X1FL8", "B000055Y0Y", "B00005B6JZ", "B000EHQU0S", "B00AEBB9UK", "B00008G7UF", "B0002B15ZG", "B00005JG6N", "B001MBTTNA", "B001ECDVJU", "B00003CWQR", "B00AEFY4CG", "630471193X", "B002GHHHP6", "B00AEBB9NM", "B0000A02TZ", "0767821769", "B00569I5BQ", "B00AEFYSWM", "B00AEFXYJA", "B000XT1P3E", "B002GHHHGU", "B00026ZG10", "6305128952", "B00005OLYF", "B001LMAK9W", "B000N6U0E2", "B000EMGJ7C", "B000023VTP", "B00CPTUOI2", "B004SIP9U6", "B00001ZWUS", "B003BV8ICC", "B0043X1FM2", "B0013XZ2QK", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00AEBB9FA", "B007SPPANM", "B00005JM4Q", "B007N31YH0", "B000VECAD0", "B00003CXO1", "B00009WVSL", "B00003CXSM", "B000NA1WDQ", "B00004BZIY", "B002AS464Q", "B000J103OI", "B000021Y7L", "B000ENC5YW", "B0002V7ON8", "B00009W5CA", "B00015YVDG", "B0009X75O2", "B0000JBALO", "0767803434", "6305065551", "B000MQC9H4", "6305692572", "B00013RC2U", "6305144168", "B00008979G", "B000CCBCAS", "0792846443", "B000M341QE"], "bought_together": ["B0001AVZA8", "B000YAF4MA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001AVZA8", "B0038N9WKU", "B000YAF4MA", "B00013WWT8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5469}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.96, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "0767811100", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KRRMHSAJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "As Good As It Gets"}

{"description": "Minnie Driver stars as an impoverished Jewish woman, Mary,  living in an emphatically anti-Semitic England in the mid-19th century. Following  the murder of her beloved father--who leaves his survivors strapped with  his debts--she camouflages her identity as a Protestant of Italian descent  and takes a job as governess to an unorthodox Scottish family. In this film  by Sandra Goldbacher, sundry conventions from Victorian novels mix with a contemporary, feminist take on Mary's subsequent adventures. Mary  asserts, with some effort, her authority over her willful charge (Florence  Hoath); she dodges the insults of a vaguely ghoulish matriarch (Harriet Walter);  and she becomes an aide, confidante, and lover to the man of the house (Tom Wilkinson), a naturalist dabbling with early experiments in  photography. Goldbacher fails to make it all feel as fully realized as it could be  (much of the detail and soul of Mary's life in London is too telescoped and impressionistic to sink in). But the film's middle section, in which  the heroine's complicity with Wilkinson's married character engages her  keen intelligence as well as her untapped sensuality, is deeply felt. It's  nice to see Driver prove she can carry a film, though the dreamy, exotic photography by Ashley Rowe certainly pulls a viewer along as well.--Tom Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 425881}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.79, "brand": "", "asin": "0767811429", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518E0FZ868L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Governess [VHS]"}
{"description": "Forever embroiled in controversy,Midnight Expressdivides viewers into opposing camps: those who think it's one of the most intense real-life dramas ever made, and those who abhor its manipulative tactics and alteration of facts for the exploitative purpose of achieving a desired effect. That effect is powerfully achieved, regardless of how you may feel about director Alan Parker and Oscar&reg;-winning screenwriter Oliver Stone's interpretation of the story of Billy Hayes. It was the American Hayes--played by the late Brad Davis in an unforgettable performance--who was caught smuggling two kilograms of hashish while attempting to board a flight from Istanbul, Turkey, in 1970. He was sentenced to four years in a hellish Turkish prison on a drug possession charge, but his sentence was later extended (though not by 30 years, as the film suggests), and Hayes endured unthinkable brutality and torture before his escape in 1975.Unquestionably, this is a superbly crafted film, provoking a visceral response that's powerful enough to boil your blood. By the time Hayes erupts in an explosion of self-defensive violence, Parker and Stone have proven the power--and danger--of their skill. Their film is deeply manipulative, extremely xenophobic, and embellishes reality to heighten its calculated impact. Is that a crime? Not necessarily, and there's no doubt thatMidnight Expressis expertly directed and blessed with exceptional supporting performances (especially from John Hurt as a long-term prisoner). Still, it's obvious that strings are being pulled, and Parker, while applying his talent to a nefarious purpose, is a masterful puppeteer.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0008ENHUI", "0988981440", "0792833287", "B006TTC5HC", "B00007ELEY", "B004FQX5B6", "B000RTB0R6", "B000CNESTE", "B000001FBZ", "B0071HPP3M", "B00AEFXVOI", "B00AEBB95K", "B0019UGYK0", "B003ELKNH2", "0767830555", "B000059TFO", "B00079Z9VO", "B00013RC2U", "B0006GANN2", "B00005MEOU", "B00AEFXN9G", "079284646X", "B000C20VPA", "B000P0J0AG", "B0006GAOJA", "B00008O38F", "B00AEBB9UK", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B007N31YH0", "B000067IZ3", "0792846443", "6305132917", "B000A2UBN4", "B002AT8KAG", "B00AEFXV3E", "B000C20VRS", "0792838408", "B000286RP2", "B0038Z5T4Q", "B00066FBQG", "B000P0J0EW", "B00049QJ9I", "B001PYD0PC", "0800141806", "B00AEFYRP0", "B0000YEEGM", "B0000DI87S", "B0002V7ON8", "B00407PNY2", "B001R3YRG2", "B003O7I6SE", "B00AEFXEZE", "6304765258", "B000EHSVS2", "B00005U2KC", "B003TRMLQM", "B00005M2CO", "B000063US2", "B0045HCJFS", "B00AEFXBPM", "B0001US62I", "B000E5N684", "B003LMPKSQ", "B001G1FL3S", "B00009W5CA", "B000022TSY", "B00005LC4D", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00011CZRE", "B000ZM1MG4", "B00005JXY5", "B00005NB8K", "B00006ADD5", "B000P0J09M", "B000PAAJZ6", "B004SIP8ZM", "B0013XZ2QK", "B007UW9W5U", "B00B0U2SFE", "B000059HAN", "B0010YVCI4", "B00004ZBVF", "B0009UZG3C", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00AEFXD1O", "B000XJD34I", "B00IA7MFEO", "B00002VWE0", "B000M341QE", "B0007KIFGE", "B00007BKVC", "B003ASLJJK", "B00AEBBADG", "B007TBIUSM", "B00AEFXG2U", "B000LP6KNU", "B00005JLRE", "B003INBNOS"], "bought_together": ["B0008ENHUI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0988981440", "078322947X", "B003ELKNH2", "B00005PJ8T"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 132494}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.28, "brand": "", "asin": "0767817486", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/714SYCVAS8L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Midnight Express"}

{"description": "Akira Kurosawa's sequel toYojimbois more lighthearted and less cynical, a rousing adventure with Toshir&ocirc; Mifune reprising his role as the scruffy mercenary who becomes an unlikely big brother to a troupe of nine naive samurai. Shuffling into a secret meeting where the proud young men discuss the graft choking their clan, Mifune's Sanjuro scratches his scraggly beard and distractedly rubs his neck like some common peasant while giving them advice on appearances and truths: \"People aren't what they seem,\" he warns the dubious lads. \"Be careful.\" Naturally they aren't, and Sanjuro grudgingly adopts the well-meaning but hopelessly ill-equipped heroes, giving the starry-eyed youths a series of lessons in real-world honor and respect while saving their skins from reckless attacks and impulsive plans. It isn't the subtlest of Kurosawa's films--the repetitious lessons and speeches delivered to the thickheaded samurai are rather obvious--but it's one of his most entertaining. Mifune, gruffly at ease with the boys, is hilariously discomforted in the presence of a cultured lady, who sees through his shaggy exterior and imparts a little wisdom of her own. Mifune bounds into action in a number of impressive sword fights--wonderfully choreographed lightning-quick battles in which Mifune leaps all over the widescreen image--but an increasing sense of waste, of futility, hangs over the action scenes, culminating in a tense but meaningless duel of honor. The accompanying trailer on the DVD features brief behind-the-scenes glimpses of Kurosawa directing Mifune through an action sequence.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000G8NXYG", "B00005B1ZL", "B001BEK8E2", "B002E01MBA", "B00K5EJHGO", "B00005JLEJ", "B00180R072", "B000AQKUD6", "B000067IY6", "B0007989YS", "B00000K0DM", "B007N5YK10", "B00005JLMU", "B00687XNNK", "6305028699", "B0009WIE2A", "0780021045", "0780021061", "B000ASATM6", "B001WLMOL4", "B000BB14I0", "B000C6NP7M", "B005D0RDPM", "B00004Y7HL", "B000BR6QCI", "B000XPSC0C", "B005JJCMN0", "B0001UZZSG", "B000NOK0H6", "B004XQO8MS", "B002ZG4Q5W", "B006H3KQSK", "B000AQKUGI", "B000056NWP", "B00005QAPH", "B000PC6Z48", "B0017MO0U6", "B0001VO38S", "B00019JR5Y", "B0000B1ODS", "B000E5LEV0", "B00004W3HF", "B00000C0QO", "B00005NC66", "B001PCNZJU", "B000FS9FIK", "B00B2BYXSQ", "B00065GX0K", "B000AQKUG8", "B002BWP4A6", "0792841409", "6305257450", "B003N2CVQ8", "B002AFX53W", "B00000CQJZ", "B004KDYR7A", "B000AQKUC2", "B003KGBISY", "B003VA3JTA", "B00005JLV7", "B003WKL6XA", "B00009V7OB", "6304698798", "B0000A02TW", "B005D0RDCU", "B005152C7S", "B000AQKUH2", "B000WEH74G", "B0007GAG42", "B00AEFYSEA", "B000059TFW", "B008CJ0JS4", "B000FDECGA", "B007Y1NR1W", "B00005UQ7T", "078002205X", "0792839056", "0780020707", "B0080WPADW", "B001LMU1C8", "B00AQ6J64O", "B000025RE7", "B0002V7O0Q", "0783225903", "B001O549G6", "B007K7IAYY", "B004NWPY20", "B000BQ5J18", "B000065V38", "B001LMU1B4", "B00DHN8FXG", "B00065GX64", "B000I8OOG0", "0780022343", "B0049985XW", "B000055Y0X", "B0026VBOJC", "0780022041", "B00GBT62N8", "B00005A8TX"], "bought_together": ["B000G8NXYG", "B001BEK8E2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000K0YM0Y", "B000G8NXYG", "B00008RH1H", "B001BEK8E2"]}, "price": 24.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 185087}, "asin": "0780022491", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KN3PM18EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sanjuro (The Criterion Collection)"}

{"description": "A mixed bag that received mixed reviews when released in 1994, this lavish film works overtime to honor the spirit and style of the vintage pulp novels and radio shows that madeThe Shadowa household name in the 1930s and '40s. Alec Baldwin plays the Shadow, a.k.a. Lamont Cranston, who arrives in New York from his decadent life in Tibet, fully reformed and disciplined in his ability \"to cloud men's minds.\" A crime fighter who lurks in the dark recesses of the city, the Shadow faces his most deadly challenge when Shiwan Khan (John Lone), the last surviving descendant of Genghis Khan, hatches a plot to conquer the world. The scheme involves a madman (Tim Curry), a hapless scientist (Ian McKellen), and various traps designed to catch and kill the Shadow, who must also contend with his blossoming romance with Margo Lane (Penelope Ann Miller), a slender beauty capable of a little mind play of her own. The movie's art deco production design turns out to be a scene-stealer when the plot drags, and in the title role Baldwin is never given enough good material to create a compelling character. Still,The Shadowis true to the legacy that inspired it, admirably avoiding any conspicuous compromise of its 1930s style and setting. If you can't get into the story, you're sure to be hooked by the look of the production, which is never less than dazzling.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00BTYMPUY", "6305428514", "B003Q7B7BU", "B00005T7I1", "B000PFUAP0", "B00801OMDM", "B00264QI68", "B000051SH3", "0783226012", "B0002J58J2", "B0080JTIX8", "B004BBHVIS", "B005E7SF7E", "B0038ZITIE", "B0006IIPIK", "1558908846", "B000FVQLKM", "1606903616", "B000ION23U", "B004EPZ07K", "B003G5K7RW", "B005G5NPD8", "B00007AJF5", "B00003CWU3", "B0011367SY", "B00JL6L4UY", "B0045HCJKS", "B001RHGRT8", "0800195175", "B0009ZBVBI", "B004EXWGJW", "0780622650", "B0006L0LOS", "6304712499", "B00005JKU0", "B000056WR3", "B0000YEEPS", "B0002A2VLY", "B0002J58HO", "B00AKGG828", "0790738511", "B0045HCJT4", "B00D3LA7G0", "B000056PMU", "B000055Y0Y", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B002GHHHNI", "B000AQOHNA", "B0019BI1DM", "078401132X", "B002GHHHOM", "B00004Y87O", "6305127646", "B0085A9HU6", "B002NZK5Q4", "B002GHHHME", "B0024FADAQ", "0767818105", "B000CNE09M", "B00006IUJO", "B004VT9JLC", "B00026ZG10", "B0000844I8", "B0045HCJGC", "B00003CXKA", "0767802454", "B002GHHHP6", "B000QUCQX8", "B001ARDC16", "0783225547", "B003Q7B71K", "B001MVYUQG", "B00070FX5U", "B004EPYZPS", "B00HFWETQW", "0783225946", "B0006HBZXS", "B0002V7OI8", "B002VWNID6", "B00GOYC3P6", "6305761078", "B00BTYOYG2", "B000BR9SA0", "0790731932", "1570199450", "B0001I55SS", "B0000959N0", "B0009MDPYM", "B00007AJGH", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B0002TSZHY", "B00009NHC0", "B0051PLQR0", "B001FB55HQ", "B00AEFXPG2", "B009L4DSV4", "B0001US8F8", "B0002J58GU", "B000WC39P4", "B000063UR0"], "bought_together": ["B00BTYMPUY", "6305428514"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BTYMPUY", "6305428514", "B003Q7B7BU", "0783226012"]}, "price": 7.86, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17047}, "asin": "078321958X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QWAVSWAQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Shadow"}
{"description": "Steven Spielberg's first feature film, 1971'sDuel, is set on a desert highway. It stars Dennis Weaver as a driver being pursued by a menacing truck, which is following him with all the vengeance of the ancient furies. In this spiritual update from 1984, C.&nbsp;Thomas Howell plays a guy taking a drive-away car from Chicago to San Diego. On a whim, in the rain, and against his better judgment, he picks up a hitchhiker (Rutger Hauer). The hitcher quickly admits to being a murdering psychopath, and once Howell finally gets him out of his car, he is pursued with all the vengeance of the ancient furies. We're never sure if the hitcher is a figment of his imagination, making Howell a schizophrenic killer, or if he's real and Howell is the random victim of a wandering madman, which is how his potential new girlfriend (Jennifer Jason Leigh) thinks of him. Either way,The Hitcheris great fun, kinda scary, and teetering on the brink of \"must see.\"--Andy Spletzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00009LIA5", "B000NO3DLG", "B00595W3QK", "B00LLAV26O", "B000063UR5", "B00AEFXKZ8", "B00004RERE", "B00LBFFR2Y", "B00IYJRIKO", "B0001FGBWK", "B002AMVEII", "B0002YLEBI", "B006ZGROB6", "B0000589K4", "B000PMFRYC", "B000E1ZBIG", "0767817664", "B002JT69OG", "B0013527K2", "B00AEBB91E", "B0002WT4OE", "B000069I05", "B0024FADD8", "B00005N5RM", "B000RGN2JI", "B000TSIJWY", "B000MX7V3O", "B000IMUYJM", "B0009X768W", "B00006L92P", "B00JJOY45U", "B008CYDD7I", "B0000VV55I", "B00009OWI1", "B000E8M0P6", "6305137382", "B001DZOC64", "B002GHHHG0", "B00AEFY37C", "B00004TS0G", "B0002VYOVS", "B004QF71ZM", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B0002IQLH6", "B000MV8ABS", "B00JJOY47I", "B0002DB5PO", "B0024FAG44", "B0002O7XW2", "B000FS9FE4", "6304936532", "B000AM6OQ2", "B00005KH30", "B00006FDCU", "B000Q66Q8I", "B0053TWW36", "B0002C4JIU", "B00012FX4K", "B00HRUQ8X4", "B00009PY4C", "B0007WQHI0", "B00JJOY496", "B000H5TH1Q", "B0001611DI", "B001KEHAEO", "B000099T3M", "B0001Y4M22", "B000031EG1", "B00JQYV0B4", "B00AEFXR8I", "B0002C4JJ4", "B000EOTVU2", "0783229399", "B00005AQMK", "B005GT3X68", "B000N4RAQU", "B00JF5GAY6", "B000MV8AC2", "B00AEFY31S", "B005ZHBEPI", "B00E0FW07W", "B00KCTG4PO", "B0053TWV46", "B00ARWX9NG", "B0000694WL", "B000068IEV", "B000RPCJA2", "0792846435", "B00008L3UQ", "B002VWNIDG", "B004QXJZY4", "B002HWUU9U", "B001B8XRT6", "B007XF0W3K", "B002HML6YI", "6305869103", "1573623865", "0792846443", "B000GBEWRU"], "bought_together": ["B00009LIA5", "B000NO3DLG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000NO3DLG", "6305161860", "B0000589K4", "B001BGS16W"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 70249}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 17.09, "brand": "HAUER,RUTGER", "asin": "0783114893", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51fbu7rU1ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Hitcher"}
{"description": "Steven Spielberg's 1993 mega-hit rivalsJawsas the most intense and frightening film he'd ever made prior toSchindler's List, but it was also among his weakest stories. Based on Michael Crichton's novel about an island amusement park populated by cloned dinosaurs, the film works best as a thrill ride with none of the interesting human dynamics of Spielberg'sJaws. That lapse proves unfortunate, but there's no shortage of raw terror as a rampaging T-rex and nasty raptors try to make fast food out of the cast.

{"description": "Jim Carrey is back in top form after his disastrous outing inThe Cable Guy. As a lawyer who becomes physically unable to tell a lie for 24 hours after his son makes a magical birthday wish, Carrey learns a few brutal truths about the real meaning of life. There is very little plot, but Carrey's rubbery contortions and slapstick trickery provide just enough humor to keep you interested in this breezy bit of escapism. Not aided in this film by pets or animation, Carrey manages to do amazing and unique things with very simple props. He is also more in control of his acting than before. He is still over the top, but remains believable in some of the lower-energy scenes. An added plus is that the comedy is not as coarse as we've come to expect from him.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000AKCKK", "B00005LOUS", "630339406X", "6303454089", "630309239X", "0788816454", "0767821912"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 378437}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.9, "brand": "", "asin": "0783219458", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51S7QFYMYQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Liar Liar [VHS]"}
{"description": "Director Martin Scorsese reunites with members of hisGoodFellasgang (writer Nicholas Pileggi; actors Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Frank Vincent) for a three-hour epic about the rise and fall of mobster Sam &quot;Ace&quot; Rothstein (De Niro), a character based on real-life gangster Frank &quot;Lefty&quot; Rosenthal. (It's modeled after onWiseguyandGoodFellasand Pileggi's true crime bookCasino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas.)  Through Rothstein, the picture tells the story of how the Mafia seized, and finally lost control of, Las Vegas gambling. The first hour plays like a fascinating documentary, intricately detailing the inner workings of Vegas casinos. Sharon Stone is the stand out among the actors; she nabbed an Oscar nomination for her role as the voracious Ginger, the glitzy call girl who becomes Rothstein's wife.

{"description": "Clint Eastwood's second film as a director (and his first Western) is a variation on the &quot;man with no name&quot; theme, starring Eastwood as the drifter known only as &quot;the Stranger.&quot; He rides into the desert town of Lagos and is quickly attacked by three gunmen. Recovering with the aid of a local dwarf (a memorable role for Billy Curtis), the Stranger is hired by the intimidated townsfolk to fend off a band of violent ex-convicts. After teaching the citizens self-defense and instructing them to paint the entire town red and rename it &quot;Hell,&quot; the Stranger vanishes.

{"description": "Following the successful 1998 video release ofCatscomes another Andrew Lloyd Webber blockbuster musical,Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, and it's a savvy choice. It hasn't been represented on film before, it's short enough (78 minutes) to present without cuts, and it has the star power of former teen icon Donny Osmond, who played over 1,800 performances across North America. Rather than record a live performance,Catsdirector David Mallet conceivedJosephas a film, though one that is based strongly on codirector Steven Pimlott's 1991 London revival and relies more on camerawork than venturing beyond its stagelike sets.Lloyd Webber's first project with lyricist Tim Rice was originally written in 1968 as a school cantata; accordingly, this film uses a framing sequence of a school recital, with an audience of clapping, singing kids and members of the faculty playing the roles. The Old Testament tale of Joseph and his coat of many colors gets a splashy, vigorous treatment with an energetic cast, Las Vegas-style glitz, and catchy, eclecticsongs, including \"Any Dream Will Do,\" \"Close Every Door,\" the peppy \"Go, Go, Go Joseph,\" and various bits of country, calypso, and Elvis. Osmond is perfect in the title role, with a strong voice and winning persona, while London stage veteran Maria Friedman performs well in the central role of the narrator. Richard Attenborough appears (and sings a little) as Jacob, and Joan Collins makes a brief, nonsinging cameo.Josephcertainly isn't revolutionary musical theater, but if you view it as a kids' show, it's a silly good time (though there are poignant moments too). Parents should note, however, that this production might warrant a little discretion due to one suggestive scene and some risqu&eacute; costumes.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000001E0A", "B00028HBIO", "B00004XMTJ", "0767827929", "B000BSM28O", "6304806418", "B000003JAN", "B00005NGAE", "B000RPCK2E", "B000001E34", "B00001PE59", "B0007TKNII", "B001LMAKAG", "B000056NX5", "B0013Z7RUC", "B000I2J6YG", "B00004W5VC", "B000ATQYVK", "B005SFR7YE", "B0000VCZKM", "B000VKL6RK", "B00008973A", "B0000AM6IY", "B0090XLDKY", "B00004Z4SE", "B002HK9IDQ", "B00004YNUM", "B005NFJAZS", "B000AABKWC", "B000HT3PGU", "B00BX8PG3Y", "B005S9EK5Y", "0793508398", "B000GDH9JQ", "B00005JL1P", "B002D0L0R2", "B000BZ9TKG", "B00DM3TKNU", "B00004WI56", "B00005OCMS", "B001LMAKAQ", "B003E66Y70", "B006GHA9QQ", "0792841638", "B001PO550A", "630530209X", "076781326X", "B009M1HJ3O", "B00003CXPD", "B000E1YVZU", "B000067D1R", "0767827651", "B008E8XBZG", "B00070HK24", "B002YICN6U", "B0044RFTCY", "B00AEFYTEY", "B004SEUJBE", "B000077VR3", "B004SIP9U6", "B00004YTY2", "B00005JM6A", "B004I2K4DY", "B00006D295", "B00J2T18EW", "B00AATV0WS", "B007P7UF0G", "B002NZK5TG", "B0000TB01Y", "B0045HCJ80", "B007XTDWKQ", "B00005JLIU", "B0047CG9F2", "B00AEFY5TI", "B0000VV4W2", "B00E9ZATKI", "B0045HCJJY", "B000HT3PGK", "B005GZ2CWS", "B00F0JGA6E", "B00JAOW3MA", "B008H6GHJM", "B00AEFXYOA", "B00004R99S", "B008CRC506", "B00AMSM9CW", "B00003CXC3", "B00C7JGDBW", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B00JDCORSC", "B00000JGOQ", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00AEFY6ZQ", "B0084IHVUC", "B00HWMP0OU", "B008YWY0HK", "B00005RRGB", "B00GOC75YW", "B00J89SH4A"], "bought_together": ["B00028HBIO", "B00004XMTJ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000001E0A", "B00004XMTJ", "B00028HBIO", "B000003JAN"]}, "price": 10.49, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1835}, "asin": "0783240287", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EFTGFT94L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat"}

{"description": "After scoring a hit with the Eddie Murphy-Nick Nolte cop thriller48 Hours, director Walter Hill returned to the buddy formula with this half-ridiculous, half-invigorating action flick about humorless Russian cop Ivan Danko (Arnold Schwarzenegger). He follows a drug dealer from Moscow to Chicago, where he's matched up with city cop Art Ridzik (James Belushi), whose work ethic is considerably more relaxed. Most of the humor revolves around Danko's grumpy reaction to good ol' American capitalism, while Ridzik urges him to chill out.Red Heatis not bad as action comedies go, but only if you get into the absurd spirit of this predictable fare, in which the unlikely buddies get to wisecrack and act casually while mayhem erupts everywhere they go. Incidentally,Red Heatwas the first American film allowed to shoot in Moscow's Red Square.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000RW3VCK", "B00AKGG828", "B00013RC8E", "B000BPL2FQ", "B002GHHHME", "6305767866", "B00070FX5U", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B000056PMU", "B00005JKIP", "B000RJO56E", "B0001Z37HM", "B00026ZG10", "B00004XMSC", "B000FC2FQA", "B0045HCJG2", "B0000VD12I", "B00005JA8B", "B001VLBDD0", "0783226926", "0783225504", "B00005N5S5", "6304602944", "0783230370", "B00000IQW2", "1558908846", "B00BLF9FOK", "B0045HCJ5S", "B0045HCJFS", "B000U1ZV62", "B001TK80C0", "B00004STDN", "B0045HCJGC", "B003AWRMA6", "B00441GYZG", "B00005QCVU", "B00007AJG4", "0783225946", "B00004Y87O", "B00AEFYDM2", "0783241895", "B005COLETU", "B000QXDCLU", "B000B8GT92", "6304779631", "B000MEYKEG", "6304806434", "B002OGMGV4", "B000U1ZV8K", "B0004Z33G4", "B0000C3I6U", "B000055Y0Y", "B002AT8KA6", "B003IMMEL0", "B00DYXCHN8", "B00H1RMWYW", "B0001FGBWK", "B001B3LIOC", "B000056PNL", "B000065V3E", "B000TJBN6W", "B00018YC3M", "B000063INF", "B0015XHQT4", "B0004Z33EQ", "B002WDR4AC", "0790742004", "B0000542CC", "B00AEFXBG6", "B000U1ZV4Y", "B001M9ELQC", "B0004Z33F0", "0792835735", "0790732149", "B00005O06W", "0767817648", "B00JU949TK", "B0045HCJT4", "B00AEFXIIW", "B0000542CD", "6304711891", "B0043K8LX6", "B00441GYY2", "B0045HCIWW", "B000QUCQX8", "0783227892", "B003ASLJNQ", "B003AWRM9W", "B000MGBSE4", "B000FI8MPW", "B000JYW5BO", "0790729334", "B004SIP6WW", "B0002S94CK", "0790729695", "B00031V23K", "B00441GYXI", "0790736411", "B003ASLJMW", "B0001FGBXE"], "bought_together": ["B00070FX5U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001932ZA", "0800177975", "B000GUJYI8", "B00070FX5U"]}, "price": 2.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 202002}, "asin": "0784010226", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J4G74HZRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Red Heat"}
{"description": "Writer Ernest Thompson, who came up with the original stage play ofOn Golden Pondand adapted it for film, is lucky to have two giants of the screen give dignity and breadth to his sometimes trite dialogue. Henry Fonda, in his last role, plays a prickly English professor at the disagreeable age of 80. Visiting his summer house by a Maine lake with his wife (Katharine Hepburn), the old man forges an unlikely bond with a lonely boy, comes to terms with his daughter (Jane Fonda), and suffers disorienting effects of mild dementia. Even playing a tired old man, Fonda is an absolute lion of a movie star, and Hepburn brings her special spirit to the part of his worried bride. The onscreen relationship between Henry and Jane Fonda naturally makes one think about their much-discussed difficulties offscreen, but that's a side benefit in a movie that is really just a celebration of simple human decency. Directed by Mark Rydell (Harry and Walter Go to New York).--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002VWNIBI", "6305212112", "B00001W9G0", "B003ASLJK4", "B00DDT0JB0", "B00AEFYK5M", "B0001CNRBG", "B00005NRN8", "B00004TJKK", "B00AEBB9FA", "0767836359", "0783240171", "B0045HCJ76", "B00AEFY4CG", "B0007QJ1XE", "B000765IJK", "B00AEFY0F2", "076780676X", "B000ZM1MG4", "6305128952", "B006FE83UE", "B002GHHHGU", "B001ECDVK4", "0822208482", "B004SIP6C2", "B00AEFXD1O", "B00AEFXYOA", "B002VWNIAY", "B000TXP56C", "B003LMPKSQ", "B000YAF4MA", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B0000DIXDR", "6305236569", "B00AKGG5WG", "B002NZK5RS", "B00005MEOU", "B0000AOV4I", "B004AOECXI", "B00008CMSX", "B000JYW5B4", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00AEFYRJQ", "B00CPTUOI2", "6304698607", "B0000542C9", "0783225733", "B003BV8ICC", "B00079Z9VO", "B000FOPPC4", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B0000648ZR", "B00AEBB97S", "B004SEUJOQ", "B00004W46I", "B000YDBPAM", "B00066FAOE", "B007STBUHI", "B0007ZEOPK", "B007N31YH0", "B000BITVAG", "B00AEBBA0E", "B002M2Z3BA", "0790731886", "B00004RG62", "B0009R1TJ0", "B00070HK24", "B00009AVA5", "B009ERK1ZO", "B00004XPPC", "B00FEDP5XK", "B000Y11BBW", "B00AATV046", "B0000YTP02", "B001JNNDLU", "B0028ZDJN0", "B0013D8LH2", "B0001AVZA8", "B0006J28LO", "B000WTVZHQ", "B0057P4SAQ", "B0001I55R4", "B00005V5NS", "B00AEFYNG8", "B007XTDWKQ", "B001ECDVJU", "0783230486", "B00066FBQG"], "bought_together": ["B002VWNIBI", "6305212112"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DDT0JB0", "B00AEFYK5M", "B00004TJKK", "B003ASLJK4"]}, "price": 24.5, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 133435}, "asin": "0784011648", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JR83516RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "On Golden Pond"}
{"description": "Robin Williams won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, and actors Matt Damon and Ben Affleck nabbed one for Best Original Screenplay, but the feel-good hitGood Will Huntingtriumphs because of its gifted director, Gus Van Sant. The unconventional director (My Own Private Idaho,Drugstore Cowboy) saves a script marred by vanity and clunky character development by yanking soulful, touching performances out of his entire cast (amazingly, even one by Williams that's relatively schtick-free). Van Sant pulls off the equivalent of what George Cukor accomplished for women's melodrama in the '30s and '40s: He's crafted an intelligent, unabashedly emotional male weepie about men trying to find inner-wisdom.Matt Damon stars as Will Hunting, a closet math genius who ignores his gift in favor of nightly boozing and fighting with South Boston buddies (co-writer Ben Affleck among them). While working as a university janitor, he solves an impossible calculus problem scribbled on a hallway blackboard and reluctantly becomes the prodigy of an arrogant MIT professor (Stellan Skarsg&#229;rd). Damon only avoids prison by agreeing to see psychiatrists, all of whom he mocks or psychologically destroys until he meets his match in the professor's former childhood friend, played by Williams. Both doctor and patient are haunted by the past, and as mutual respect develops, the healing process begins. The film's beauty lies not with grand climaxes, but with small, quiet moments. Scenes such as Affleck's clumsy pep talk to Damon while they drink beer after work, or any number of therapy session between Williams and Damon offer poignant looks at the awkward ways men show affection and feeling for one another.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FVQLQQ", "B000P0J0EW", "6305144168", "B0043X1FL8", "B00000IQV7", "B00AEFY0F2", "B0000YEEGM", "B00JPQ1INI", "B004FQX5B6", "0800141741", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00562D3Y2", "B00125WAWS", "0783226845", "B003ASLJQS", "B00005JLRZ", "B000M341QE", "B0034G4P7G", "B002ZG99N6", "B000N4RAR4", "0767811100", "6305428352", "B000P0J0EM", "B00009W5CA", "B002NZK5UK", "B003ASLJO0", "B00003CWQR", "B004SIP7VM", "B000B8QG22", "B00005V9HH", "B001F34HRS", "B004AOECXI", "B000N6U0E2", "B00AEFXYJA", "079284646X", "B0043X1FM2", "B00AEFY17E", "B000066HAS", "B000PHVZNE", "B003AWRMC4", "B00000G3PA", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00005JKWX", "B000MZHW40", "B000Z8GZYW", "B0018CWW5K", "B000P0J0C4", "B000P0J09M", "B00004BZIY", "B00B0U2SFE", "B003AWRMCE", "B00001ZWUS", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005B6JZ", "B00005JLSB", "B0002ZDVEU", "6305428271", "B000FKO5QK", "B00AEBB9SM", "B00007GZR5", "B001SN78JO", "B000QQLVPQ", "630587493X", "B0001ADAVK", "B004WCTLNY", "0792843592", "B00AEBBA36", "B000FVQLRA", "B00AEFXXMI", "B000XJD33O", "B0002WZTOI", "B00004XPPG", "B00008G8M4", "B00AEBB9LO", "B000056VP4", "B006VRRGNK", "6305313687", "B0006FYOTC", "B001QERPAC", "B002O3Z4WK", "B001680M26", "B00AEFY4CG", "B000YDBPAM", "B0068FZ0GK", "0767836359", "B00005JN2Z", "B000765IJK", "B00008NFR4", "630471193X", "B002NZK5VO", "B000EGDB10", "B000068MBX", "B00000J122", "B00AMSLDTM", "B000MNOX94", "B000R4SMCW", "B00009AOBI", "B000XR9L50", "B00005JOC9"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000P0J0EW", "B000M341QE", "0783226845", "B002ZG99N6"]}, "price": 8.67, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 107799}, "asin": "0788814664", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EQNMPT51L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Good Will Hunting"}
{"description": "Disney's adaptation of the beloved fairy tale became a classic in its  own right, thanks to some memorabletunes(including \"A Dream Is a Wish  Your Heart Makes,\" \"Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo,\" and the title song) and some endearingly cute comic relief. We all know the story--the wicked stepmother and stepsisters simply won't have it, this uppity Cinderella thinking she's going to a ball designed to find the handsome prince an appropriate sweetheart, but perseverance, animal buddies, and a well-timed entrance by a fairy godmother make sure things turn out all right. There are a few striking sequences of pure  animation--for example, Cinderella is reflected in bubbles drifting through the air--and the design is rich and evocative throughout. It's a simple story padded here agreeably with comic business, particularly Cinderella's rodent pals (dressed up conspicuously like the dwarf sidekicks of another famous Disney heroine) and their misadventures with a wretched cat named Lucifer. There's also much harrumphing and exposition spouting by the King and the Grand Duke. It's a much simpler and more graceful work than the more frenetically paced animated films of today, which makes it simultaneously quaint and highly gratifying.--David Kronke", "related": {"also_bought": ["155890641X", "6304401132", "0788812408", "6302526574", "0788806270", "0788812807", "6303314015", "6302642248", "6302787068", "078881172X", "6302320402", "6304500831", "6305229449", "6300274268", "6300274195", "B000035Z2S", "0788803743", "6303983812", "6304089767", "0788805843", "6302961572", "6303929338", "6300275310", "6304290888", "6305319138", "B0000AQZYM", "6302178924", "6304400551", "B00005JKDQ", "0788805533", "6305940932", "6302158095", "B00003CX7L", "B00005T7H6", "6304978286", "6305326940", "6304501153", "6304089201", "B00003CXQX", "6304100507", "B00000JS61", "B0009SUS4Q", "6303534422", "B00005RDVV", "B00000ICHA", "6304400225", "B000JBWWRO", "B00004R99N", "6300274608", "B00005JL95", "6303036813", "6304873441", "B00005JKX3", "6304117752", "0788811002", "1558901892", "B00003CXHR", "6301390725", "6303122647", "6303939015", "0788812440", "6305942285", "1558906150", "B0000524CZ", "6300276554", "6301991311", "0792839129", "0788810634", "B00004R99I", "B0000E32WB", "6302426200", "B00003CWPW", "6304492960", "6304400381", "6301948106", "6301750667", "6304492952", "0788809806", "6302642493", "6303439357", "6303123244", "B000035Z46", "B00016JF2W", "6304401736", "B00003CXXI", "B00004REYY", "B00005RDWC", "6304155972", "078880720X", "6302484359", "B00003CXG6", "080013558X", "6302409780", "B00005K9OA", "B00005RRG3", "6305177473", "6300276864", "B00006IUM9", "B00000G3AV"], "bought_together": ["155890641X", "6304401132"], "also_viewed": ["155890641X", "0788806270", "0788812408", "6303314015", "6304401132", "6302526574", "078881172X", "6302320402", "6302642248", "0788812807", "6304500831", "6300274268", "6302787068", "6304089767", "B000035Z2S", "6303983812", "0788805843", "6305229449", "6300274195", "6302961572", "B0000AQZYM", "6304400551", "6305940932", "0788805533", "6303929338", "6302178924", "6300275310", "B00005JKDQ", "6304290888", "6304100507", "6303534422", "6304978286", "6305319138", "6305326940", "6302158095", "B00003CX7L", "B0007KTBIU", "B00003CXQX", "B00005JL95", "B00005RDVV", "6304400225", "B00004R99N", "6304501153", "B00003CXHR", "B00005T7H6", "6303036813", "6304737491", "6304089201", "B00004R99I", "6302426200", "6301991311", "B000JBWWRO", "B000035Z46", "0788812440", "B00003CXCQ", "B00006CXK5", "B0000E32WB", "6304401736"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 49761}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.99, "brand": "The Walt Disney Company.", "asin": "0788802194", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JRS7PR6VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cinderella (Walt Disney's Masterpiece) [VHS]"}

{"description": "Martin Scorsese's 1990 masterpieceGoodFellasimmortalizes the hilarious, horrifying life of actual gangster Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), from his teen years on the streets of New York to his anonymous exile under the Witness Protection Program. The director's kinetic style is perfect for recounting Hill's ruthless rise to power in the 1950s as well as his drugged-out fall in the late 1970s; in fact, no one has ever rendered the mental dislocation of cocaine better than Scorsese. Scorsese uses period music perfectly, not just to summon a particular time but to set a precise mood.GoodFellasis at least as good asThe Godfatherwithout being in the least derivative of it. Joe Pesci's psycho improvisation of Mobster Tommy DeVito ignited Pesci as a star, Lorraine Bracco scores the performance of her life as the love of Hill's life, and every supporting role, from Paul Sorvino to Robert De Niro, is a miracle.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000C20VPA", "B000C20VRS", "B008R65XYC", "B000M341QE", "B0018CMJSU", "B0019L770A", "B0019L21GA", "B00004XPPB", "B000P0J0AG", "B0000DI87S", "B000P0J0EW", "B00003CXWV", "B00CCMKPO0", "B00G1C2URC", "B00004U103", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004SIP95G", "B002CPMB9O", "B0019L21H4", "B007TBIUSM", "B000286RP2", "B00011CZRE", "B004SIP8ZM", "B0006GAOJA", "B002T9H2LA", "B006TTC5HC", "B002VWNIEA", "0767830555", "B0000AMJEK", "B0000AM6JI", "B00005V9HH", "B004FQX5B6", "B000SFOW8I", "B00008975Z", "B002CA68N4", "6305313687", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00013RC2U", "0792174909", "B007D0FVRM", "B000A7DVR2", "B004G7XCRQ", "B002QEHPQU", "B003ASLJO0", "B000LP6KNU", "B000H5TH20", "B000P0J09C", "6305263248", "0783229526", "B00009W5CA", "B001C0I61M", "B000EHSVRI", "B00IEK9U0E", "B002ZG980U", "B004SIP7TE", "B004SIP7ZS", "B0006GAO5Y", "B00B0U2SFE", "B000ERVKBC", "B000A2UBN4", "B002AF4Y9G", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B0000714BS", "B000E5KQHI", "B00005JA8B", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B003AWRMCE", "B000P0J0EM", "1558908390", "B00080ZG10", "0767802519", "B003ELKNH2", "B003BV8I3Q", "B000035Z5G", "B00AEFXDO6", "B000E8NRBC", "B00000JGHV", "B00004RJ71", "B00AEBB9CS", "B004SIP93S", "B00AEFYSEA", "B004SIP6WW", "B003ASLJQS", "B0001Z4OXS", "B002VWNIDG", "0783225946", "B00AEBB9ZK", "B00AEFXXMI", "B0000A02TZ", "B000MZHW40", "B004SIP6GI", "B002ZG99N6", "B00AEBB95K", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00BB67UNW", "B00029RTAI", "B000P0J0D8", "B003ASLJOU", "B000Z8GZYW", "B003ASLJS6"], "bought_together": ["B000C20VPA", "B000C20VRS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000M341QE", "B0018CMJSU", "B000P0J0EW", "B00BCB1JJW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 120285}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.49, "brand": "WARNER STUDIOS", "asin": "0790729725", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YHNBJW24L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "GoodFellas"}
{"description": "When Prince's dazzling and dynamicPurple Rain(movie and soundtrack album) and the hypnotic hit single &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; exploded onto the pop-culture scene in 1984, it seemed there was nothing the purple one couldn't do. The film is basically a feature-length music video, but no musician has ever had a better big-screen showcase for his many talents.  The plot is really just a theme (about the son of an abusive father struggling not to continue the pattern) upon which to hang some of Prince's most dazzling songs (including &quot;Let's Go Crazy&quot; and the title tune), and some sizzling live-concert numbers.  Apollonia Kotero is ravishing as the romantic interest, and Morris Day and the Time provide some terrific musical competition.Purple Rainis an essential artifact of the mid-'80s pop Zeitgeist.

{"description": "An ultimately futile attempt to make lightning strike twice, this so-called spinoff from 1993's blockbusterThe Fugitiveavoids the label of \"sequel\" by forging ahead without the first film's star, Harrison Ford. The idea is to showcase the return of Tommy Lee Jones in his Oscar-winning role as tenacious U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard, this time testing his mettle against a covert government operative (Wesley Snipes) accused of murdering two secret service attach&eacute;s. Unfortunately, Jones and the entire cast have been trapped in a rambling plot, and the underdog status that made Ford such a compelling hero is sacrificed to an evenly matched and eventually tiresome game of cat and mouse, with a villain whose identity is far too predictable.

{"description": "Steven Seagal has always been an awkward action hero. Initially, he had  a certain amount of credibility thanks to his nebulous association with secret government agencies and mastery of aikido, which helped to excuse his bad acting. But as a self-righteous action hero in the vein of Schwarzenegger and Stallone (which helps to explain his bad acting), Seagal fell into unintentional self-parody faster and more dramatically than either of his two predecessors. InOut for Justice, Seagal plays Gino Felino, a Brooklyn-born cop known and respected by everyone--both good and bad--in his neighborhood. The worst of the neighborhood baddies is Richie Madano (William Forsythe), a crack-smoking killer who murders his partner and terrorizes the neighborhood. Technically, Felino is a terrible cop--touching evidence at murder scenes, stealing evidence, intimidating witnesses--but only by breaking those rules can he bring in this horrible criminal.

Julianna Margulies (ER) has a small but thankless role as Richie's hooker girlfriend, and Gina Gershon (Face/Off,Bound) has an equally thankless role  as Richie's foul-mouthed, bar-owning sister.

{"description": "Running time 127 minutes, Black and White, with original theatrical trailer. Starring Humphrey Bogart and Walter Huston, Tim Holt and Bruce Bennett, directed by John Huston.\n\nGold in the hills, avarice in the hearts of men. Two hard-luck drifters (Bogart and Holt) and a grizzled prospector (Huston) discover gold. Then greed and paranoia set in.\n\nShot mostly on location in Mexico, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre cost a then-whopping $3 million - and led to a showdown. At that price, Jack Warner argued, the top-billed Bogart shouldn't be bumped off before the finale. But director John Huston stood his ground and went on to win high honors: two Academy Awards for his direction and screenplay. And his father won the Oscar as Best Supporting Actor. Without awards, but with enduring acclaim, is Bogart's performance, transforming before our eyes from a likable hobo to a heartless thug who simmers in his own greed. A half-century later, its placement on the American Film Institute's Top 100 American Film list confirms it's still a powerful movie.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790743159", "6301968948", "6301797906", "0783222955", "B000BWIZRW", "B000BWIZTU", "6304429274", "6303402070", "0800100832", "6301978110", "6304196954", "6304111398", "630150528X", "6302816254", "B00000F13T", "0792839846", "6301977165", "6302227127", "6303109950", "6302158176", "630233683X", "0792837371", "6302353785", "630018627X", "6302032245", "0790734079", "B00005A1VH", "0792837967", "0800125762", "B00000FZCU", "6300215512", "0800132009", "0792837630", "6301801954", "630266232X", "0790743531", "6302226899", "1558807780", "1569942072", "6301800974", "6302909023", "6304259131", "6301805615", "6301798759", "B000PYKZYC", "B000006914", "0790748169", "6303393985", "6300216012", "6300268470", "B000077VT7"], "bought_together": ["0790743159"], "also_viewed": ["6305123616", "0783216084", "6303402070", "6304429274", "6301797906", "1558807780"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 418473}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0790743523", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HQXK3ZV4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre [VHS]"}

{"description": "This 1941 melodrama is memorable for both its strong central performances and their intimations of how the previous decade's crime dramas would evolve into film noir--no accident, given the solid direction of veteran Raoul Walsh and the hand of screenwriter John Huston, who teamed with the author of its novelistic source, W.R. Burnett (Little Caesar). In the central character of Roy \"Mad Dog\" Earle, a fictional peer to John Dillinger, Humphrey Bogart finds a defining role that anticipates the underlying fatalism and moral ambiguity visible in the career-making roles soon to follow, including Sam Spade in Huston's directorial debut,The Maltese Falcon.Earle suggests a prescient variation on the enraged sociopaths that were fixtures of the gangster melodramas that shaped Bogart's early screen image. Pardoned from a long prison stretch, the weary robber is clearly more eager to savor his new freedom than immediately swing back into action. But his early release has been engineered by a mobster who wants Earle to pull off a high-stakes burglary, setting in motion a plot that is a prototype for doomed-heist capers--a small, yet potent subgenre that would later include Huston'sThe Asphalt Jungleand Stanley Kubrick'sThe Killing.What givesHigh Sierraits power, however, isn't the crime itself but Earle's collision with the younger, brasher confederates picked to help him, and the hard-edged but vulnerable taxi dancer they're competing for, played forcefully by Ida Lupino, who actually received top billing. Her attraction to the reluctant Earle is complicated by a convoluted subplot designed to showcase then starlet Joan Leslie, but the movie finally moves into its most gripping moments when the wounded Earle, pursued by police, flees ever higher toward the mountains. His final, suicidal showdown would become a clich&eacute; of sorts in lesser films, but here it provides a wrenching climax sealed by Lupino's vivid final scene.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790743159", "6304429274", "6301976983", "B0000068EE", "B000BWIZRW", "B000BWIZTU", "6302875064", "0792839153", "0783217528", "6301978110", "6303391931", "079074886X", "6301975987", "B002VWNIAY", "6304212151", "6303430910", "6300213900", "6301327845", "0790746387", "6302801133", "630442972X", "6303402070", "6300216500", "6301973291", "6301491920", "6302952581", "6300213838", "6302360978", "0792835077", "6301964012", "6300163431", "6301967909", "6301971426", "0782008348", "6300181537", "0790733897", "6300185168", "6302032245"], "bought_together": ["6304429274", "0790743159"], "also_viewed": ["0790743159", "B0000068EE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 439485}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790747154", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516TJZC5XFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "High Sierra [VHS]"}

{"description": "When the theatrical release of James Cameron'sTitanicwas delayed from July to December of 1997, media pundits speculated that Cameron's $200&nbsp;million disaster epic would cause the director's downfall, signal the end of the blockbuster era, and sink Paramount Studios as quickly as the ill-fated luxury liner had sunk on that fateful night of April&nbsp;14, 1912. Some studio executives were confident, others horrified, but the clarity of hindsight turned Cameron into an Oscar-winning genius, a shrewd businessman, and one of the most successful directors in the history of motion pictures.Titanicwould surpass the $1&nbsp;billion mark in global box-office receipts (largely due to multiple viewings, the majority by teenage girls), win 11&nbsp;Academy Awards including best picture and director, produce the best-selling movie soundtrack of all time, and make a global superstar of Leonardo DiCaprio. A bona fide pop-cultural phenomenon, the film has all the ingredients of a blockbuster (romance, passion, luxury, grand scale, a snidely villain, and an epic, life-threatening crisis), but Cameron's alchemy of these ingredients proved more popular than anyone could have predicted. His stroke of genius was to combine absolute authenticity with a pair of fictional lovers whose tragic fate would draw viewers into the heart-wrenching reality of theTitanicdisaster. As starving artist Jack Dawson and soon-to-be-married socialite Rose DeWitt Bukater, DiCaprio and Kate Winslet won the hearts of viewers around the world, and their brief but never-forgotten love affair provides the humanity that Cameron needed to turnTitanicinto an emotional experience. Present-day framing scenes (featuring Gloria Stuart as the 101-year-old Rose) add additional resonance to the story, and although some viewers proved vehemently immune to Cameron's manipulations, few can deny the production's impressive achievements. Although some of the computer-generated visual effects look artificial, others--such as the sunset silhouette ofTitanicduring its first evening at sea, or the climactic splitting of the ship's sinking hull--are state-of-the-art marvels. In terms of sets and costumes alone, the film is never less than astounding. More than anything else, however, the film's overwhelming popularity speaks for itself.Titanicis an event film and a monument to Cameron's risk-taking audacity, blending the tragic irony of theTitanicdisaster with just enough narrative invention to give the historical event its fullest and most timeless dramatic impact.Titanicis an epic love story on par withGone with the Wind, and like that earlier box-office phenomenon, it's a film for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305123616", "6304117752", "6301792734", "6303215734", "B00000JS61", "6304178352", "6303396623", "6303314015", "B00003CXTF", "0769403468", "6301734734", "6302936381", "6303300480", "6305368139", "B00005RRG3", "6302610702", "0792839846", "6300207919", "B000P0J0C4", "6304546262", "B000056BRF", "6304400551", "6303101267", "630150528X", "6303637574", "B000P0J0EW", "6305126062", "6302935148", "0800199421", "6304681496", "0792116887", "6301963911", "B0000DCGT1", "B00001IVED", "6305169187", "B00006RCST", "6300216721", "630197879X", "0800113055", "076780922X", "080010367X", "0800141326", "0800184319", "6304039522", "B000066AXC"], "bought_together": ["6305123616"], "also_viewed": ["B009VQHDSQ", "6303314015", "B0074JODXU", "B00003CXTF", "B003JQZXWW", "6302787068", "6301796535", "0788812807", "0788806270", "B00005JKDQ", "6304500831", "6305229449", "6304117752", "6300213668", "6304089767", "B0000AQZYM", "079213690X", "6303049079", "6305123616", "6303402348", "6301792734", "0788812408", "B00079HZSE", "B000035Z2S", "B00000K3AN", "0788805843", "6302526574", "B0000029YC", "6303534422", "6303215734", "B0070285YE", "B00008LDO9", "0783216084", "6304434340", "B00BBND56G", "0788805533", "6300183211", "6302320402", "6305750750", "B0002CHI3S", "0790748266", "6304143184", "B0000040CM", "B005X7H9SQ", "B00004RFHF", "B00005V1Z7", "6302814782", "6301572688", "B00000JS61", "B008SLUWZG", "6303257844", "B00078XGO2", "0790736039", "B0000040EJ", "B000065U6Q", "B00003CX7L", "B00000ADKZ", "6300263673", "6302178924"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 65950}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.47, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "0792151712", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21BAWEVBJ1L.jpg", "title": "Titanic [VHS]"}
{"description": "At her job, driving instructor Abbie (Madonna) has no problems getting her students to bend over backwards and tie themselves into knots for her. But in life she can't seem to find anyone to tie the knot with her. Robert (Everett), her best friend and confidant, runs a successful landscaping business but is having equally dismal luck finding his Mr. Right. When Abbie's latest relationship crumbles, she turns to Robert (who happens to be gay) for comfort and advice. They commiserate over a parade of margaritas and martinis, which results in an unexpected tryst. Abbie becomes pregnant and believing, that this may be her one shot at motherhood, decides to have the child. Robert, committed to being a good father, moves in with her, and together they create an unconventional but loving home for their precocious son, Sam (Stumpf). Robert continues to date but keeps parenting as his first priority. Abbie, on the other hand, uses her yoga skills to remain celibate but finally relents when she meets Ben (Bratt), a handsome and charming investment banker. Romance flowers between Abbie and Ben, and as they grow closer Robert feels his role as father threatened.

There's also a seductive villainous with the suggestive name of Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen), and the great actress Judi Dench makes her first appearance as Bond's superior, M, who wisecracks about 007's &quot;dinosaur&quot; status as a globetrotting sexist.

{"description": "This was the first James Bond adventure produced after the success ofStar Wars, so it jumped on the sci-fi bandwagon by combining the suave appeal of Agent 007 (once again played by Roger Moore) with enough high-tech hardware and special effects to make Luke Skywalker want to join Her Majesty's Secret Service. After the razzle-dazzle ofThe Spy Who Loved Me, this attempt to latch onto a trend proved to be a case of overkill, even though it brought back the steel-toothed villain Jaws (Richard Kiel) and scored a major hit at the box office. This time Bond is up against a criminal industrialist named Drax (Michel Lonsdale) who wants to control the world from his orbiting space station. In keeping with his well-groomed style, Bond thwarts this maniacal Neo-Hitler's scheme with the help of a beautiful, sleek-figured scientist (played by Lois Chiles with all the vitality of a department-store mannequin). There's a grand-scale climax involving space shuttles and ray guns, but despite the film's popular success, this is one Bond adventure that never quite gets off the launching pad. It's as if the caretakers of the James Bond franchise had forgotten that it's Bond--and not a barrage of gizmos and gadgets (including a land-worthy Venetian gondola)--that fuels the series' success. Despite Moore's passive performance (which Pauline Kael described as &quot;like an office manager who is turning into dead wood but hanging on to collect his pension&quot;),Moonrakerhad no problem attracting an appreciative audience, and there are even a few renegade Bond-philes who consider it one of their favorites.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000RPCK1K", "B000NIBUR6", "B000M53GLS", "B000RPCK24", "B000M53GN6", "B000RPCK1A", "B000RPCK0Q", "B000NDEXPM", "B000NIBUS0", "B001R10BN2", "B000M53GMW", "B000RPCK1U", "B000M53GNG", "B000NIBURQ", "B000M53GM2", "B000NDEXPC", "B00004RG62", "B001EDVNNU", "B000M53GMC", "B00004WEJZ", "B001PPLIEG", "B00AQSN7HE", "B007REV4T8", "B00005JL0I", "B009PN18R2", "B004BR7XLM", "B008YAPQX4", "B000067J15", "B00AZFECBS", "B00006BH8G", "B00AZFECJU", "B009RO9LKK", "B00AZFECL8", "B00000BLFI", "B009L6VWRO", "B000HT3PF6", "B009NUUBBQ", "B001AQT0WW", "B0000BYRO9", "B0001ENZLQ", "B009NUTPAO", "B009NUV0E8", "B0014C2FX8", "B009L6UDUG", "B00008K76U", "B005LAII44", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001U6YI9W", "B00AZFECS6", "B000O599YY", "B00AVWIQZS", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B007STBUHI", "B0045HCJ9O", "B004OB2EYQ", "B003Q6D2B4", "B00005PJ8S", "B004EPYZUS", "B008JFUO72", "1612185452", "B00005ATZT", "B00DZFKNFO", "B0000BYRO7", "B000BZISSU", "B00001U0BN", "B00AEFYENK", "B0014Z4ON4", "B001AQMBIC", "B0000UJL96", "B004L9GMBC", "B001PO6FF4", "B000FO0AA6", "B0000AUHOH", "B00009NHC0", "0792839064", "B000MGTQ7U", "B00005JLRQ", "B001AQO3WO", "0783226039", "B00AEBB8VK", "B00005JKU0", "B0013LL2Z2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000RPCK24", "B000M53GN6", "B001R10BN2", "B000NDEXPM"]}, "price": 11.94, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 283251}, "asin": "0792838033", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513267YK57L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Moonraker THX Edition"}
{"description": "A stirring example of courage and the indomitable human spirit, for many John Sturges'sThe Great Escapeis both the definitive World War II drama and the nonpareil prison escape movie. Featuring an unequalled ensemble cast in a rivetingly authentic true-life scenario set to Elmer Bernstein's admirable music, this picture is both a template for subsequent action-adventure movies and one of the last glories of Golden Age Hollywood. Reunited with the director who made him a star inThe Magnificent Seven, Steve McQueen gives a career-defining performance as the laconic Hilts, the baseball-loving, motorbike-riding \"Cooler King.\" The rest of the all-male Anglo-American cast--Dickie Attenborough, Donald Pleasance, James Garner, Charles Bronson, David McCallum, James Coburn, and Gordon Jackson--make the most of their meaty roles (though you have to forgive Coburn his Australian accent). Closely based on Paul Brickhill's book, the various escape attempts, scrounging, forging, and ferreting activities are authentically realized thanks also to technical advisor Wally Flood, one of the original tunnel-digging POWs.

{"description": "This yoga set is perfect for busy people who need to work in a way to relax. On the a.m. tape, Rodney Yee takes you through a 15-minute morning yoga set, while Patricia Walden leads a 20-minute evening routine on the p.m. tape. The a.m. tape was filmed on a beach on Maui at sunrise, providing a soothing background for this gentle workout. In the morning, Rodney tells us, \"the body is rested but stiff from inactivity.\" The stretches he demonstrates are designed to increase circulation, improve mobility, and bring clarity to your mind. The movements are easy to follow (they include a conscious relaxation, the a.m. workout, and a guided meditation), and the set is short enough that it can be squeezed into the most hectic of morning schedules. The p.m. video was filmed at sunset in Death Valley. Patricia's yoga set is designed to quiet the mind after the stress of the day and to help you make the transition from active to quiet. She uses a combination of a centering series, standing poses, forward bends, and restorative poses to help you ease into night. You will need some firm blankets to sit on and a yoga strap (although a belt or scarf will serve the same purpose) to perform these movements. Perfect for the beginner and for the overworked.--Jenny Brown", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00007JME6", "6303296785", "0945671636", "B00000G3GH", "0945671075", "B000YV1L4E", "B00004T6FH", "B001F76OKC", "0945671873", "630394177X", "B00000I1OI", "B00000JPRS", "B000067D1C", "B00005RV8X", "B00005T33G", "6301475917"], "bought_together": ["6303296785", "0945671636"], "also_viewed": ["B00007JME6", "B001F76OKC", "B000067D1C", "B000YV1L4E", "B000UUX2P0", "B00DYZ80WI", "B001AYWY68", "B00002EPXL", "B00ADO9C9I", "B0000A2ZQE", "B003K8WBEM", "B001HAO8NM", "6303296785", "B000H8RVSO", "B00000I1OI", "B000069HPZ", "B0011Z5NLE", "B005QUQRDS", "B00004TKIC", "B00029QOTA", "0945671075", "B00A0XYDXM", "630394177X", "B00ADO9CHA", "B000RE94M4", "B00062DKO0", "B001GP5TLI", "B000094J6K", "B0050W0UTO", "6304851790"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 74348}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 8.99, "brand": "Brand: Living Arts", "asin": "094567189X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41B0520SDWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "AM/PM Yoga for Beginners [VHS]"}
{"description": "Thirteen-year-old Jenna (Shana Dowdeswell) has had enough with the trials of adolescence. In addition to being saddled with a devoted-but-nerdy best friend, Matt (Sean Marquette), she falls victim to one of the dangers of playing Seven Minutes in Heaven with the coolest kids in school: being stranded without a willing make-out partner. Humiliated, Jenna buries herself in the aforementioned make-out closet, wishing she could skip the whole adolescence bit and move straight into adulthood, and miraculously wakes up just weeks away from her 30th birthday. Of course, a lot has changed since going to bed the night before, not the least of which being an impressive set of womanly curves. The new, older Jenna (Jennifer Garner) is a successful magazine editor with friends in high places and a lion's share of potential suitors -- including a hockey-playing boyfriend and a swarthy married man.

{"description": "With the knockout one-two punch of 1992'sReservoir Dogsand 1994'sPulp Fictionwriter-director Quentin Tarantino stunned the filmmaking world, exploding into prominence as a cinematic heavyweight contender. ButPulp Fictionwas more than just the follow-up to an impressive first feature, or the winner of the Palme d'Or at Cannes Film Festival, or a script stuffed with the sort of juicy bubblegum dialogue actors just love to chew, or the vehicle that reestablished John Travolta on the A-list, or the relatively low-budget ($8 million) independent showcase for an ultrahip mixture of established marquee names and rising stars from the indie scene (among them Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Harvey Keitel, Christopher Walken, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Julia Sweeney, Kathy Griffin, and Phil Lamar). It was more, even, than an unprecedented $100-million-plus hit for indie distributor Miramax.Pulp Fictionwas a sensation. No, it was not the Second Coming (I actually thinkReservoir Dogsis a more substantial film; and P.T. Anderson outdid Tarantino in 1997 by making his directorial debut with two even more mature and accomplished pictures,Hard EightandBoogie Nights). ButPulp Fictionpacks so much energy and invention into telling its nonchronologically interwoven short stories (all about temptation, corruption, and redemption amongst modern criminals, large and small) it leaves viewers both exhilarated and exhausted--hearts racing and knuckles white from the ride.

{"description": "Ten years elapsed between W.C. Fields's debut in the 1915 short \"The Pool Sharks\" and his role in D.W. Griffith'sSally of the Sawdust, but it didn't take long for Fields to become one of the all-time great screen comedians. This essential collection--the silent \"The Pool Sharks\" plus the five \"two-reeler\" sound shorts that established Fields's acerbic style--provides a comprehensive document of the comedian's work in progress. \"The Pool Sharks\" develops a routine that Fields created in vaudeville and later perfected on film, with stop-motion animation used here to realize the comedian's wacky luck at billiards. It's a clever appetizer, but Fields was a verbal comic, so the two-reelers are the full-course meal.Like the Marx brothers'The Cocoanutsa year earlier, 1930's \"The Golf Specialist\" mines humor from high jinks in sunny Florida, where Fields is nearly upstaged by a stone-faced golf caddy. The classic \"The Dentist,\" despite the later addition of strident musical cues, is presented in its entirety, including an oft-censored bit in which Fields tugs a molar from a woman who's wrapped around him in a highly suggestive position. \"The Pharmacist\" and \"The Barbershop\" are variations on the theme, allowing Fields to toss offbons motsand scathing sarcasm, but it's the anomalous \"The Fatal Glass of Beer\"--a hilarious send-up of Yukon gold-rush adventures--that proves an unlikely highlight. It's typically sour-pussed in its agenda, with a running gag (involving the line \"It ain't a fit night out for man nor beast\") that just grows funnier with each repetition. Fields's comedy wasn't fully developed here--he became masterful in later features--but6 Short Filmsis crucial in demonstrating his rapid refinement of the vintage Fields persona.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000LC4C0Q", "B000E6ESX0", "B00BY0EBDC", "B00LT1JHLW", "B00006SFJ7", "B0030W6V6W", "B00BB0FRUG", "B001CW7ZSA", "1559746777", "B005BYBZKY", "B0011U3OA6", "B00BOM98PG", "B004WPYO6U", "B00005UMFC", "B0001HAIP4", "B001WLMOOG", "B000KRNGOA", "0780023536", "B004ALIG4M", "B009RWRIP2", "B0006Z2NAY", "B00EVIORN8", "B00005A8TU", "B00K5EJHGO", "B004ALIG4W", "B00005A8TV", "B00GPPXNEE", "B00004TX1R", "B001O549FM", "B00HVOFP6W", "B00J2PQZEY", "B00008RH15", "0780023161", "B000BC8SWE", "B002ID099O", "B0046ZYEVG", "B0043HQWA8", "B00B2BYXWM", "B00005EBSB", "B00AQ6J536", "B0009298N4", "B00J2PQYY0", "B0007WFYC0", "B004ALIG1U", "B0001ZIYDO", "B008Z0D5L8", "B00A8QDIMS", "B00HE010QM", "B00AQ6J3AG", "B0033535GA", "B0002CHIFG", "0780023307", "B004WPYO7E", "B00GPPXOTS", "B003355TOQ", "B00005BJWI", "B00004Z1FM", "B0030U1TFW", "B004ALIG0G", "B001WLMOHI", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B00005QAPJ", "B000E1MXTQ", "B001P829O6", "B00HE010LC", "B00005B1ZK", "B00AQ6J5I6", "B00AQ6J5JU", "0375402179", "B00014K5Y6", "B003E9SDBW", "B00IGK6TGU", "B00GBT637S", "B000CBG5PG", "B00BJB2H14", "B000HT3QBE", "B00IGK6T9W", "0780023080", "B00ITE4XUM", "B00GBT61YS", "B00GBT62PQ", "B00BJB2GUQ", "B00IO9J5XW", "B00007GZR4", "B00JVGV2OC", "B005HK13OK", "6305211264", "B00004ZBVO", "B000059H7Q", "B008Y5OWMK", "B00D9BNOKK", "B00009PY45", "B0047P5FSQ", "B0000633SC", "B00BJB2H1E", "B003N2CVRC", "B00DZP1BY6", "B003N2CVQI", "0780023099", "B00HVOFP08"], "bought_together": ["B000LC4C0Q", "B000E6ESX0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000LC4C0Q", "B00BY0EBDC", "B00006SFJ7", "B000E6ESX0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 149096}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 113.89, "brand": "Image Entertainment", "asin": "1559409053", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5165CCA718L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "W.C.

{"description": "Robert Bresson drew inspiration from Dostoevsky'sCrime and Punishmentfor this examination of an arrogant young pickpocket who deems himself above the laws and conditions of ordinary men. Michel (Martin LaSalle), a rather bland-looking young man with a perpetually blank face, haunts the subways, city streets, and racetracks to ply his trade. He plays a game of wits with a fatherly police inspector and walls his heart off from the affections of a quiet young woman, Jeanne (Marika Green), who looks after his dying mother. Bresson's direction of his \"models\" (as he calls his nonprofessional performers) strips them of affectation and motivation, making them blank slates defined by the accumulation of precisely drilled actions and words.Pickpocketis no thriller, though Bresson offers impressive, meticulously detailed scenes of daring and intimate robberies (one sequence on a subway feels like an homage to Sam Fuller'sPickup on South Street). Rather, it is a powerful, profound search for meaning and spiritual enlightenment by a man who believes in nothing but himself, and many critics consider it Bresson's masterpiece. Paul Schrader, whose bookTranscendental Cinemaoffers a detailed analysis of Bresson's work, has quoted the famous, emotionally restrained yet spiritually moving conclusion in two of his own films:American GigoloandLight Sleeper.--Sean Axmaker", "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 597369}, "asin": "1567301290", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21WTVB3RD3L.jpg", "title": "Pickpocket [VHS]"}
{"description": "Abrasive, self-deluded humor tinges the prickly exploration of sexual politics in French director Eric Rohmer's world and it often makes for less-than-comfortable viewing. Though Rohmer has made movies for several decades, his best-known films comprise a cycle loosely dubbed \"The Six Moral Tales\" (one short, one featurette, and four features), which also includesLa Collectionneuse,My Night at Maud's, andChloe in the Afternoon. Rohmer's comedies are full of the disillusion and jaded settling that come with age and adulthood, and he sharply contrasts cynicism against the naivet&eacute; and  easy, innocent wisdom of youth. InClaire's Knee, Jean-Claude Brialy plays a diplomat named Jerome Montcharvin, who agrees to housesit a friend's rural but lavish country estate for a month. Jerome appears contented with life as he's recently become engaged to Lucinde, a woman he's known for six years. He takes refuge in the fact that she is his opposite, and placates his doubts by reminding himself that \"a woman made for me would bore me.\" Into this summer idyll and Jerome's predictable, ordered life come two teenage girls who threaten his faithful but passionless ardor for his fianc&eacute;e. To temper  his awakening libido, Jerome pretends to \"experiment\" with the young women's affections and, in doing so, exposes himself as a cruel, callous man who is clueless as to his true nature. Though a close woman friend cautions him that \"in love, there is will,\" he dismisses the possibility yet in the end performs an act of \"pure will\" with one of the teens, the lovely Claire, and brashly hurts that which he most desires.Claire's Kneewas shot by the brilliant cinematographer, the late Nestor Almendros, and the color palette in the film is a masterpiece of style and scheme. It's a Monet on celluloid, and its visual prowess, combined with the provocative, unsettling theme, earned the National Society of Film Critics' Best Film prize in 1971. (Unfortunately,  the first \"reel\" of the DVD transfer contains several noticeable scratches and the color is also faded and purple.)--Paula Nechak", "related": {"also_bought": ["1572522127", "B003VA3JTA", "B005KQVE1S", "B00004Z1FM", "B00ATK02FO", "B002IVDLH8", "1572525428", "B00005UJY6", "B0038SUB1O", "B000087EY6", "B000056EWF", "157252541X", "B005J7K9AA", "B00004U0FL", "1572522135", "B00019JR6I", "B00000IBQ1", "B00000JJHL"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FUF7CQ", "B00005UJY6"]}, "price": 63.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 64493}, "asin": "1572522445", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RWJZ3PD1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Claire's Knee"}

{"description": "Jean-Jacques Annaud'sThe Name of the Roseis a flawed attempt to adapt Umberto Eco's highly convolutedmedieval bestsellerfor the screen, necessarily excising much of the esoterica that made the book so compelling. Still, what's left is a riveting whodunit set in a grimly and grimily realistic 14th-century Benedictine monastery populated by a parade of grotesque characters, all of whom spend their time lurking in dark places or scuttling, half-unseen, in the omnipresent gloom. A series of mysterious and gruesome deaths are somehow tied up with the unwelcome attention of the Inquisition, sent to root out suspected heretical behavior among the monastic scribes whose lives are dedicated to transcribing ancient manuscripts for their famous library, access to which is prevented by an ingenious maze-like layout.Enter Sean Connery as investigator-monk William of Baskerville (the Sherlock Holmes connection made explicit in his name) and his naive young assistant Adso (a youthful Christian Slater). The Grand Inquisitor Bernado Gui (F.

{"description": "When Columbia Pictures sought to pair Mae West and W.C. Fields in a film, neither was thrilled, but since both stars' careers were on the skids, they agreed to the project. They fought about everything: script, billing, casting, philosophy, work habits, style. Onscreen, Fields is always the butt of his own jokes. West never is. He's all broad slapstick, she, all sly innuendo. In the film West hangs onto her precious image--that inimitable combo of sexiness and wit--as Fields systematically subverts it. It's the clash of the screen-legend titans.In the Wild West town of Greasewood, West, as Flower Belle Lee (her usual seductive saloon singer), is kidnapped by the Masked Bandit (Joseph Calleia, in a role Bogart turned down). After refusing to turn him in, she's run out of town and can only return when she's \"married and respectable.\" She meets flimflam man Cuthbert J. Twillie (Fields) on a train. He's instantly smitten: \"My heart is a bargain today, will you take me?\" \"I'll take you, and how,\" she agrees, spying his satchel of cash. Many plot twists later, Twillie's on the gallows. Hangman: \"Have you any last requests?\" Twillie: \"I'd like to see Paris before I die. Philadelphia will do.\" In her ideal happy ending, West's Flower Belle finds true love--with two men--the Masked Bandit and the town muckraker, Wayne Carter (Dick Foran).The film's funniest scenes involve Field's futile attempts to get West into a compromising position: \"I have some very definite pear-shaped ideas I'd like to discuss with thee.\" Suffice it to say that Fields ends up in bed with a goat.--Laura Mirsky", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302798434", "078322835X", "630018305X", "6300186016"], "bought_together": ["6302798434"], "also_viewed": ["6302798434"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 325922}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.87, "brand": "", "asin": "6300181294", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5196A24E18L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "My Little Chickadee [VHS]"}
{"description": "For those who love the Marx Brothers (Animal Crackers,A Night at the Opera), that this movie is side-slappingly funny is a given. For those new to the Marx Brothers, this is the perfect introduction to Groucho, Chico, and Harpo (and even Zeppo), three of the funniest men to ever grace the screen. Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho) is the dictator of the small nation Freedonia. The country is a disaster, in financial disrepair, and the wealthy Mrs. Teasdale (Margaret Dumont) is its benefactor and the object of Firefly's shrewd affection. When the leader of the neighboring Sylvania decides he's in love with Mrs. Teasdale, Firefly declares war. The movie, from 1933, is tremendously satirical, a play on politics and war.

And remember, while you're out there risking your life and limb through shot and shell, we'll be in be in here thinking what a sucker you are.\") Full of witty lines, great sight gags, and even some snazzy song numbers (\"Freedonia's Going to War\" is the hilarious declaration of battle), this is surely one of the best--if notthebest--the Marx Brothers have to offer.--Jenny Brown", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301221494", "6300181243", "6301965965", "6300184072", "B0000040EK", "6301337999", "B004P9UWLY", "1558807780", "6301976126", "0790743213", "6301963911", "0783221347"], "bought_together": ["6301221494", "6300181243"], "also_viewed": ["B0000040EK", "B004P9UWKA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 314000}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.49, "brand": "", "asin": "6300181367", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51713HWP6QL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Duck Soup [VHS]"}

{"description": "This splatter flick, along with John Carpenter'sHalloween, helped spawn the great horror-movie movement of the '80s, not to mentioneightsequels, many of which had nothing to do with the films that preceded them.

Forever duplicated, the originalFriday the 13thpopularized a number of themes and techniques that today are now clich&eacute;s: the increasingly gory murders, the remote forest location, the anonymous and nubile cast, the murderer as cult hero, and, of course, the moral that if you have sex, you will die, very painfully. Still, if you have to see aFriday the 13thmovie, this is the one to check out. A group of eager (and horny) teenagers decide to reopen Camp Crystal Lake, which 20 years earlier was closed after the shocking and mysterious murders of two amorous camp counselors. You can take it from there, as the teens get picked off one by one, during a dark and stormy night; of course, their car won't start and there's no phone. The ending stole shamelessly from Brian De Palma'sCarrie, but it still provides a slight if campy shock. Look for a young Kevin Bacon as the requisite stud--you can tell that's what he is because when the cast appears in swimsuits, he's wearing a Speedo--who's the beneficiary of the film's best murder sequence, an arrowhead to the throat.

Jeffrey Jones is nasty and scheming as the principal who's out to catch him. Jennifer Grey is winning as Ferris's sister (who ends up making out in the police station with a prophetic vision of Charlie Sheen). But there's a definite sense that this film was of a particular time frame: the '80s. It's still fun, though. There's Ferris singing \"Twist and Shout\" during a Chicago parade, and a lovely sequence in the Art Institute. But don't get it and expect your kids to love it the way you did. Like it or not, it's yours alone.--Keith Simanton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000490M", "630018403X", "6302091632", "6302824729", "6301570723", "6300213668", "6304718551", "0767825411", "0784011923", "6300183467", "6304932553", "6302765536", "B0000048S1", "6300214710", "630339406X", "6303344224", "6300269639", "630442972X", "0783216084", "B00000JGEI", "B00005B6ND", "6300183181", "6305814694", "0790731436", "6301578805", "6302936381", "6303506291", "6302998611", "B00006G8LB", "6300263673", "6300184269", "6300214370", "6301627768", "6301827732", "6303540082", "6302374189", "6303236863", "6302820448", "6303057942", "6300215814", "B0000BWVBD", "B00008DZ83", "6303953425", "0790705141", "B000059XY5", "0792837797", "6301966988", "6302409365", "B0002F6BQU", "6300215695", "6300185249", "6301412761", "6302581907", "6304994540", "6301208773", "6300214540", "6303123244", "6302814782", "6303454089", "6300218031", "6305537798", "B00003CXDU", "B000051S41", "0790740222", "B00023BLXA", "B000059XVO", "6304209266", "0767816617", "B000R3KOWE", "B000055YW4", "630362572X", "0790742322", "6302250269", "6300182185", "6304773366", "B00005LL26", "6302968143", "B00008R9K9", "6303853102"], "bought_together": ["6302091632", "0767825411"], "also_viewed": ["0767825411", "6304718551", "6303148352", "0783235968", "6303506291", "B00005LL26", "6300213668", "630339406X", "6304117752", "6304539258", "6304401132", "6300183467", "0783216084", "0792116887"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 53441}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.94, "brand": "", "asin": "6300214753", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/415GP1CKNGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ferris Bueller's Day Off [VHS]"}
{"description": "This minor 1955 work by Alfred Hitchcock, one of the lighter entries of his creative peak in the 1950s, is still imbued with the master's stock themes of shared guilt and romantic ambivalence. It is also hardly lacking in Hitchcockian cinematic inventiveness, such as a famous, often-imitated sequence in which some smooching between stars Cary Grant and Grace Kelly is intercut with a fireworks show that just happens to be going on outside in a Riviera setting. Grant plays a reformed cat burglar who is suspected of reviving his trade, though he knows someone else is using his old methods.

{"description": "In the tradition of such obsessively driven directors as Erich von Stroheim and Werner Herzog, Francis Ford Coppola approached the production ofApocalypse Nowas if it were his own epic mission into the heart of darkness. On location in the storm-ravaged Philippines, he quite literally went mad as the project threatened to devour him in a vortex of creative despair, but from this insanity came one of the greatest films ever made. It began as a John Milius screenplay, transposing Joseph Conrad's classic story \"Heart of Darkness\" into the horrors of the Vietnam War, following a battle-weary Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) on a secret upriver mission to find and execute the renegade Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has reverted to a state of murderous and mystical insanity. The journey is fraught with danger involving wartime action on epic and intimate scales. One measure of the film's awesome visceral impact is the number of sequences, images, and lines of dialogue that have literally burned themselves into our cinematic consciousness, from the Wagnerian strike of helicopter gunships on a Vietnamese village to the brutal murder of stowaways on a peasant sampan and the unflinching fearlessness of the surfing warrior Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who speaks lovingly of \"the smell of napalm in the morning.\" Like Herzog'sAguirre: The Wrath of God, this film is the product of genius cast into a pit of hell and emerging, phoenix-like, in triumph. Coppola's obsession (effectively detailed in the riveting documentaryHearts of Darkness, directed by Coppola's wife, Eleanor) informs every scene and every frame, and the result is a film for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301115430", "630018627X", "0790701251", "6300183211", "6303686796", "6305363668", "079284646X", "6304935811", "0784011923", "6303953425", "0792836510", "6302822688", "B000003KHS", "630021639X", "6304119046", "B00003CXE6", "6302610702", "0792158261", "B000K7VHQE", "6303036570", "6303020089", "6303651488", "0800125762", "B004LWZW9W", "B00000JGEI", "0790705141", "6302360978", "6302415853", "0783107986", "B00005ATQA", "630336568X", "0790731975", "6305095566", "6300216500", "6301662954", "6302921058", "6300246965", "6300182878", "0800100832", "B00005JKEC", "6304286961", "B000062XM6", "0784011575", "630197154X", "B00004TYS8", "B00004WIDB", "6304414099", "0800116917", "6302517036", "0800199421", "6304259131", "0783202253", "6303109950", "6303313345", "B00006C7G9", "0792837312", "6302482712", "6300213986", "6303421563", "6304039549", "B000065U6Q", "B0000A36J1", "6300182770", "B00004CNR5", "6304025831", "6303422020", "0790748169", "0800132009"], "bought_together": ["6301115430", "0790701251"], "also_viewed": ["6303953425", "6305363668", "6305750750", "B00000J2KZ", "6303506291", "6303314015"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 172447}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6300214826", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EFVS37MRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Apocalypse Now [VHS]"}

{"description": "The wartime memories of surviving World War II bomber squadrons were still crystal clear when this acclaimed drama was released in 1949--one of the first postwar films out of Hollywood to treat the war on emotionally complex terms. Framed by a postwar prologue and epilogue and told as a flashback appreciation of wartime valor and teamwork, the film stars Gregory Peck in one of his finest performances as a callous general who assumes command of a bomber squadron based in England. At first, the new commander has little rapport with the 918th Bomber Group, whose loyalties still belong with their previous commander. As they continue to fly dangerous missions over Germany, however, the group and their new leader develop mutual respect and admiration, until the once-alienated commander feels that his men are part of a family--men whose bravery transcends the rigors of rigid discipline and by-the-book leadership. The film's now-classic climax, in which the general waits patiently for his squad to return to base--painfully aware that they may not return at all--is one of the most subtle yet emotionally intense scenes of any World War II drama. With Peck in the lead and Dean Jagger doing Oscar-winning work in a crucial supporting role, this was one of veteran director Henry King's proudest achievements, and it still packs a strong dramatic punch.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301736362", "0792838556", "6301977289", "6302224462", "B00000F13T", "B00005Q4GY", "6302226899", "6300246965", "0783226152", "6303057225", "B0007TKNGA", "B0001WTWWE", "6300181472", "0792116887", "B0001NBMH6", "B00AEFYBA6", "0792837959", "6301967593", "B00005PJ8S", "6302909023", "6301979761", "0790733390", "6301798503", "B00005A1VH", "6303562248", "6301976924", "1558807780", "B0072GPQNG", "6300208281", "630299005X", "6304196954", "6302360978", "6301662954", "0782006779", "6300268748", "0800132009", "6302862906", "6302227135", "6304457316", "6302756472", "6301798708", "6301734734", "B000006N70", "630021639X", "6301564456", "6301976622", "6304071876", "6300246868", "0800100832", "0792102320", "B000M7BEPQ", "6302413435", "6301967410", "6300185192", "6303491006", "6301978390", "6301802330", "6300269795", "6304458975", "6300216217", "6302208912", "6302308208", "B000BWIZTU", "6303120474"], "bought_together": ["6301977289", "6301736362"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 322550}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.89, "brand": "", "asin": "6300247090", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MXD828JFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Twelve O'Clock High [VHS]"}
{"description": "Jack Crabb is the only white survivor of the Battle of Little Big Horn and the centenarian shares his story in this picaresque fable of the Old West. In Arthur Penn's adaptation of Thomas Berger's novel, Dustin Hoffman plays Jack from teen years into old age in a bravura performance. And Jack's story is a fantastic one: captured by Indians as a boy, reared as an Indian, shuttling back and forth between the white and Indian worlds. In the process, he befriends everyone from Wild Bill Hickock to George Armstrong Custer and is a gunslinger, a snake-oil salesman, and an Army scout.

{"description": "Hands down, this is the best movie (and was one of the first) to come out of the seemingly endless cycle of disaster movies that dominated box offices during the 1970s. It could even be argued thatTitanicowes some of its success to the precedent set by this 1972 blockbuster starring Gene Hackman as a priest who leads a small group of survivors to safety from the bowels of a capsized luxury liner. From its stellar cast to its cheesy, Oscar-winning theme song,The Morning After, the movie has all the ingredients of a popular classic, beginning with a New Year's Eve celebration aboard the ill-fatedPoseidonand ending as a pop allegory when the Hackman character becomes a Christ-like martyr. Filmed on spectacular sets where everything down is up and the ship's thick hull points in the direction of salvation, this is \"a waterloggedGrand Hotel\" (in the words ofNew Yorkerfilm critic Pauline Kael) that is as entertaining as it is unabashedly brainless.The Poseidon Adventureis filled with performances that rise above the limits of the screenplay.

{"description": "More timely now, perhaps, than when it was first released in 1957, Elia Kazan's overheated political melodrama explores the dangerous manipulative power of pop culture. It exposes the underside of Capra-corn populism, as exemplified in the optimistic fable of grassroots punditryMeet John Doe. In Kazan's account, scripted by Budd Schulberg, the common-man pontificator (Andy Griffith) is no Gary Cooper-style aw-shucks paragon. Promoted to national fame as a folksy TV idol by radio producer Patricia Neal, Griffith's Larry \"Lonesome\" Rhodes turns out to be a megalomaniacal rat bastard. The film turns apocalyptic as Rhodes exploits his power to sway the masses, helping to elect a reactionary presidential candidate. The parodies of television commercials and opinion polling were cutting edge in their day (Face in the Crowdwas theNetworkof the Eisenhower era), and there are some startling, near-documentary sequences shot on location in Arkansas. An extraordinary supporting cast (led by Walter Matthau and Lee Remick) helps keep the energy level high, even when the satire turns shrill and unpersuasive in the final reel. There's an interesting parallel in Tim Robbins's snide pseudodocumentaryBob Roberts: both these pictures have almost as much contempt for the lemmings in the audience as for the manipulative monsters who herd them over the cliff.--David Chute", "related": {"also_bought": ["0782008348", "B000006914", "6300269310", "0792837967"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 317638}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.13, "brand": "", "asin": "6300273210", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F6M66WT0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Face in the Crowd [VHS]"}

{"description": "The long shadow of Malle's autobiographical memoir of occupied France continues to fall heavily across subsequent representations of World War II, boarding school, and male adolescence--in fact, it would be difficult to identify a recent film that addresses these concerns and does not, in some substantial way, echoAu Revoir Les Enfants. The straightforward, unsentimental, gutsyEnfantsfinds its 12-year-old protagonist, Julien Quentin, sheltered from the conflict in a Catholic school. His classmate Jean, a new arrival, becomes first a competitor, then a beloved friend. Jean, however, hides a secret from his classmates and the Gestapo; evenly, subtly, Malle creates an atmosphere of hovering and inescapable danger. It won't take you more than a few frames to guess Jean's \"secret,\" and many of the plot points here are too telescoped. Nevertheless, the plainspoken courage with which Malle tells his story remains wholly engrossing. The cinematography here is masterful and drunk with childlike wonder, alternating claustrophobic, wood-paneled church interiors with vivid, occasionally frightening outdoor vistas. And never is it more affecting than in the chilling scene where Justin gets lost in the woods during a seemingly innocent game of capture-the-treasure; trees and rocks flash by the running boy with an austere, impersonal beauty.

March, a sometimes stagey actor, is at his committed best, notably in the sequence where (in a single-scene second role) he plays the simpleton mistaken for the fugitive Valjean.

{"description": "Glenn Savan's depressing and self-loathing novel about a 27-year-old upper-class Jewish widower mired in self-pity after his beloved wife dies, and who finds love and sexual rebirth with a trailer-trash older woman, was brought to the big screen by the competent director Luis Mandoki (When a Man Loves a Woman,Message in a Bottle). But the savage irony in Savan's book has been face-lifted by screenwriters Ted Tally (The Silence of the Lambs) and Alvin Sargent (Ordinary People) into something else entirely: what passes for low-rent \"slumming\" in Hollywood means hiring sexy Susan Sarandon to play Nora Baker, the poor, uneducated 43-year-old waitress in a White Palace burger joint who strikes up an unlikely relationship with sad Max Baron (James Spader). Widower Max attends a bachelor party for best pal Neil (Jason Alexander) and discovers that the local White Palace has stiffed the boys a whopping six burgers. Max barges into the joint, bent on getting his money back, and meets a testy Nora, who is bemused at the young man's insolence. While driving home, Max stops abruptly at a bar for a drink. Inside, Nora is nursing a vodka and takes a shine to the tuxedo-clad, handsome, and morose younger man. He gives her a lift, she seduces him, and the rest of the movie examines how two such opposites in manners and morals can find happiness. The only common bond they have is great sex and a private tragedy.White Palacenudges at the dark journey and the smashing of illusion that was at the heart of the novel, but there is still a fairy-tale element to the film that negates the earthy essence that distinguished the book. In Mandoki's vision,White Palaceis about overcoming class, family, and outside opinion to find true love. In Savan's book, Max wastes into decline while Nora ultimately thrives in the quest for truth, redemption, and self-forgiveness. She becomes his salvation only after he stops hating himself. But mainstream Hollywood shuns making \"protagonists\" so mad, bad, or sad, and as such, too much glitter is tossed on Spader, while Sarandon, as usual, is the only one who seems to embody and understand her character's angst. She deserved her Oscar for Nora, not the nun inDead Man Walking.--Paula Nechak", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008DDSA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 348202}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6301945301", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31EG5WX3JAL.gif", "title": "White Palace [VHS]"}

{"description": "Writer-director Sam Raimi's extremely stylized, blood-soaked follow-up to his creepyEvil Deadisn't really a sequel; rather, it's a remake on a better budget. It also isn't really a horror film (though there are plenty of decapitations, zombies, supernatural demons, and gore) as much as it is a hilarious, sophisticated slapstick send-up of the terror genre. Raimi takes every horror convention that exists and exaggerates it with mind-blowing special effects, crossed with mocking Three Stooges humor. The plot alone is a genre clich&eacute; right out of any number of horror films. Several teens (including our hero, Ash, played by Bruce Campbell in a manic tour-de-force of physical comedy) visit a broken-down cottage in the woods--miles from civilization--find a copy of the Book of the Dead, and unleash supernatural powers that gut every character in sight. All, that is, except Ash, who takes this very personally and spends much of the of the film getting his head smashed while battling the unseen forces. Raimi uses this bare-bones story as a stage to showcase dazzling special effects and eye-popping visuals, including some of the most spectacular point-of-view Steadicam work ever (done by Peter Deming). Although it went unnoticed in the theaters, the film has since become an influential cult-video favorite, paving the way for over-the-top comic gross-out films like Peter Jackson'sDead Alive.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305095566", "6302798450", "B00023NRSM", "6303257879", "0790705141", "6304983794", "6302921058", "6300214087", "B000WC3864", "6300182878", "0783227434", "6300262731", "6302088607", "6300181987", "B000005XXG", "B0001VL30O", "B000007PI9", "6303396585", "6304288433", "6300213714", "6303579388", "6300189015", "0792836685", "6300214192", "6301094352", "0783235607", "0783246641", "6304451024", "0790741512", "0792845684", "630428845X", "6300214311", "0767825411", "0792836634", "6300262855", "6302814359", "B00000I4R9"], "bought_together": ["6305095566", "6302798450"], "also_viewed": ["B00IF8Q0YE", "6305095566", "6302798450", "6300182878", "B000RIWAVW", "6301208536", "0792839234", "6302921058"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 222150}, "asin": "6302038308", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z%2BYIlqC1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Evil Dead II [VHS]"}

{"description": "Two of the juiciest roles in the American theater fall at the feet of Spencer Tracy and Fredric March, and both men make a meal of it.Inherit the Wind, based on the play by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee, is a slightly fictionalized account of the Scopes Monkey Trial, that galvanizing legal drama of the 1920s. When a young Tennessee teacher is prosecuted for teaching the theory of evolution in a public school, he receives unwanted public attention as well as the legal advice of a giant. Tracy plays the role based on Clarence Darrow, the eloquent defense attorney, and March storms his way through a part based on Williams Jennings Bryan, the failed presidential candidate (and famed orator) who prosecuted the case. Gene Kelly plays a character based on the acid-penned H.L. Mencken, reporting on the trial and caustically commenting on the absurdity of the human animal. Stanley (Judgment at Nuremberg) Kramer's direction is not especially subtle, but the verbal fireworks unleashed during the trial sequences are still stirring.

{"description": "A hallmark of the science fiction genre as well as a wry commentary on the political climate of the 1950s,The Day the Earth Stood Stillis a sci-fi movie less concerned with special effects than with a social parable. A spacecraft lands in Washington, D.C., carrying a humanoid messenger from another world (Michael Rennie) imparting a warning to the people of Earth to cease their violent behavior. But panic ensues as the messenger lands and is shot by a nervous soldier. His large robot companion destroys the Capitol as the messenger escapes the confines of the hospital. He moves in with a family as a boarder and blends into society to observe the full range of the human experience. Director Robert Wise (West Side Story) not only provides one of the most recognizable icons of the science fiction world in his depiction of the massive robot loyal to his master, but he avoids the obvious camp elements of the story to create a quiet and observant story highlighting both the good and the bad in human nature.--Robert Lane", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000HDNPM0", "6300215539", "6301327845", "6304507348", "6301977815", "6300208508", "6300181278", "0800132009", "6302120101", "6302797667", "6300181340", "6304233639", "6300183513", "0790743213", "6300181286", "6300183580", "6300269566", "6300183084", "0783235593", "0783221347", "6302884705", "0783235607", "6302763835", "0783236352", "630442972X", "6300215644", "0800116917", "0790752395", "0790743159", "6300182533", "630266232X", "6300269477", "6302605164", "6300185974", "B00005B238", "0782008348"], "bought_together": ["6300215539"], "also_viewed": ["6300208508"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 312863}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.34, "brand": "", "asin": "6302168465", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QGHTN64FL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Day the Earth Stood Still [VHS]"}
{"description": "William Friedkin's classicpolicierwas propelled to box-office glory, and a fistful of Oscars, in 1972 by its pedal-to-the-metal filmmaking and fashionably cynical attitude toward law enforcement. Gene Hackman's Popeye Doyle, a brutally pushy New York City narcotics detective, is a dauntless crime fighter and Vietnam-era \"pig,\" a reckless vulgarian whose antics get innocent people killed. Loosely based upon an actual investigation that led to what was then the biggest heroin seizure in U.S. history, the picture traces the efforts of Doyle and his partner (Roy Scheider) to close the pipeline pumping Middle Eastern smack into the States through the French port of Marseilles. (The actual French Connection cops, Eddie Egan and Sonny Grosso, make cameo appearances.) It was widely recognized at the time that Friedkin had lifted a lot of his high-strung technique from the Costa-Gavras thrillersThe Sleeping Car MurdersandZ--he even imported one of Costa-Gavras's favorite thugs, Marcel Bozzuffi, to play the Euro-trash hit man plugged by Doyle in an elevated train station. There was an impressive official sequel in 1975,French Connection II, directed by John Frankenheimer, which took Popeye to the south of France and got him hooked on horse. A couple of semi-official spinoffs followed,The Seven-Ups, which elevated Scheider to the leading role, andBadge 373, with Robert Duvall stepping in as the pugnacious flatfoot.--David Chute", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000003KDG", "6300214567", "6300216500", "0790738139", "6305261296", "630442972X", "630407185X", "0790734079", "0790733897", "0790743531", "1558807780", "630321245X", "6300247384", "6301965701", "0792837916", "0800100832", "6304429274", "6300181340", "6300213900", "6302799163", "6303212263", "6302909023", "B00008R9K9", "B000007PI9", "0766202771", "B00005A1VH"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 82875}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6302238331", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K7T6QP3QL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The French Connection [VHS]"}

{"description": "British thespian and sophomore director Kenneth Branagh follows up his adaptation of Shakespeare'sHenry Vwith this abrupt change of pace, a slick, stylish thriller evocative of Hitchcock, classic film noir, and gothic shockers. Sporting an exaggerated American accent, Branagh stars as L.A. private eye Mike Church, a hard-boiled but softhearted detective who takes on the case of a mysterious amnesiac (Branagh's then-real-life wife, Emma Thompson). With the help of an offbeat furniture dealer and part-time hypnotist (Derek Jacobi), Grace (as Mike has named her) dredges up her hidden memories. Little do they realize that her recollections are of a past life in L.A.'s recent history, and as she recounts the details of a famous marriage that ended with a notorious murder (played out as black-and-white flashbacks starring Branagh and Thompson), events of the present begin to mirror the past, as if fate were pulling the two into fatal replay of history. Branagh's flashy, flourished direction echoes with an array of '40s and '50s classics and near classics (most notably Hitchcock'sRebeccaandSpellbound) and drives the story with an edgy urgency, all the better to distract from some of the sillier elements of the plot. But while this film may not make literal sense in the harsh light of day, in the twilit, shadowy world of classic Hollywood this slyly inventive thriller is a bravura bit of old-fashioned entertainment, done up with modern flair.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302482712"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 336608}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6302289009", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H8X0SC52L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dead Again [VHS]"}

{"description": "Star Trek Vleft us nowhere to go but up, and with the return ofStar Trek IIdirector Nicholas Meyer,Star Trek VIrestored the movie series to its classic blend of space opera, intelligent plotting, and engaging interaction of stalwart heroes and menacing villains. Borrowing its subtitle (and several lines of dialogue) from Shakespeare, the movie finds Admiral Kirk (William Shatner) and his fellowEnterprisecrew members on a diplomatic mission to negotiate peace with the revered Klingon Chancellor Gorkon (David Warner). When the high-ranking Klingon and several officers are ruthlessly murdered, blame is placed on Kirk, whose subsequent investigation uncovers an assassination plot masterminded by the nefarious Klingon General Chang (Christopher Plummer) in an effort to disrupt a historic peace summit. As this political plot unfolds,Star Trek VItakes on a sharp-edged tone, with Kirk and Spock confronting their opposing views of diplomacy, and testing their bonds of loyalty when a Vulcan officer is revealed to be a traitor. With a dramatic depth befitting what was to be the final movie mission of the originalStar Trekcrew, this film took the veteran cast out in respectably high style.

{"description": "Throughout his long, wandering, often distinguished career Francis Ford Coppola has made many films that are good and fine, many more that are flawed but undeniably interesting, and a handful of duds that are worth viewing if only because his personality is so flagrantly absent. Yet he is and always shall be known as the man who directed theGodfatherfilms, a series that has dominated and defined their creator in a way perhaps no other director can understand. Coppola has never been able to leave them alone, whether returning after 15 years to make a trilogy of the diptych, or re-editing the first two films into chronological order for a separate video release asThe Godfather Saga. The films are our very own Shakespearean cycle: they tell a tale of a vicious mobster and his extended personal and professional families (once the stuff of righteous moral comeuppance), and they dared to present themselves with an epic sweep and an unapologetically tragic tone. Murder, it turned out, was a serious business. The first film remains a towering achievement, brilliantly cast and conceived. The entry of Michael Corleone into the family business, the transition of power from his father, the ruthless dispatch of his enemies--all this is told with an assurance that is breathtaking to behold. And it turned out to be merely prologue; two years laterThe Godfather, Part IIbalanced Michael's ever-greater acquisition of power and influence during the fall of Cuba with the story of his father's own youthful rise from immigrant slums. The stakes were higher, the story's construction more elaborate, and the isolated despair at the end wholly earned. (Has there ever been a cinematic performance greater than Al Pacino's Michael, so smart and ambitious, marching through the years into what he knows is his own doom with eyes open and hungry?)The Godfather, Part IIIwas mostly written off as an attempted cash-in, but it is a wholly worthy conclusion, less slow than autumnally patient and almost merciless in the way it brings Michael's past sins crashing down around him even as he tries to redeem himself.--Bruce Reid", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302054982", "6304025831", "6301792734", "6305123616", "6302383455", "B000059HFB", "6300271617", "B0000DI87S", "6304233639", "0792151712", "B00005PJ6V", "6303029027", "6300183211", "B000C20VRS", "6301574117", "0792158261", "6300214826", "B0000A36J1", "0790731975", "0783222149", "6304994540", "630354231X", "6304508611", "B00011CZRE", "6301977742", "B00003CXOO", "B00005NOHP", "B00000K3AN", "6301963911", "B000059HGY", "B000005QWI", "B00005NKW1", "6301628454", "6302822688", "6304285116", "B00000K2SO", "B000054OW2", "6302909023", "6302305934", "B00000FZCU", "0792845684", "6304071876", "B00005ATQA", "6305169187", "630268644X", "B00004W9C7", "B00004CIOV", "0800116917", "B00000K2SC", "B000067IXQ"], "also_viewed": ["6302383455", "B0019L770A", "B000003KHS", "0792174909", "B00EN09FKO", "630021639X", "B000059HFB", "6304467567", "0792152808", "B00BBND56G", "B002J40X0C", "6301792734", "0800116917", "B00000J2KZ", "0793558107", "B0000DI87S", "B0019L21GA", "0792158261", "6305363668", "6300183211", "0684836475", "6304443064", "6302158176", "B000930DLO", "B00006AL1C", "0792151712", "B000028U3S", "B00AEBB9DM", "B0018U250O", "B00AQJ8MLY", "6305123616", "B006TTC5DQ", "B00000F3SE", "B007STBUIW", "B002M2Z3BA", "B00J2R3VZI", "B00ITAQ2MS", "B0071JADFU", "B001UCJVJI", "B000LPS4BG", "B001FB55H6", "B002VWNIAY", "B008Y1YK0I", "B005FDXT32", "B005LAIIJY", "B000K6TOK6", "B00E9PMMX0", "B00KCTG4PO", "B00H9KKKAY"]}, "price": 30.59, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 105101}, "asin": "6302610702", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41yBN5Ti01L._SX300_.jpg", "title": "The Godfather Collection [VHS]"}

{"description": "Taylor Hackford (An Officer and a Gentleman) directed this 1993 epic about Chicano gang wars in the California prison system and the differing and tragic paths of three boyhood friends. Half-brothers Paco and Cruz grow up with their cousin Miklo in Chicano Los Angeles, and each in turn is influenced by their violent environment and the prevalence of drugs on their streets. Cruz becomes an artist but winds up tragically addicted to heroin, while Miklo serves time for murder and Paco becomes a cop, setting the stage for a confrontation between the two when Miklo is released from prison. The film strives for an epic feel but takes too long to set up its interweaving stories. It is notable, however, for some fine acting on the part of Benjamin Bratt and Damian Chiapa, as well as smaller roles by Billy Bob Thornton, Ving Rhames and Delroy Lindo. Its depictions of life in the California prison system are harrowing and powerful, and serve as the centerpiece of this urban drama.--Robert Lane", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B000PIIKMM", "B00004ZESY"]}, "price": 9.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 267836}, "asin": "6302968135", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZSF84252L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blood in Blood Out [VHS]"}

{"description": "Few actresses have captivated the camera as powerfully as Dorothy  Dandridge inCarmen Jones. Her polished beauty plays in irresistible contrast to her title character's leonine sexuality and fluid emotions; a man can't decide from moment to moment if he wants to save her from doom, build her a castle, or never let her out of bed. Of course, that's the problem with the boys in this semi-experimental adaptation of Bizet's opera,Carmen. Straight-arrow Joe (a strapping Harry Belafonte), an obedient corporal on a Southern military base during World War&nbsp;II, is all set to go to flight school and marry his hometown sweetie, Cindy Lou (Olga James), when his troublemaking sergeant orders him to accompany Carmen to a civilian court. In short order, Joe is swept up in Carmen's carnal anarchy and her craving for  release from lousy options in life. An impulsive act of violence ensures that Joe's future is gone forever, putting Carmen in the difficult position of destroying their relationship to save him. Oscar Hammerstein II took  Bizet's music in 1943 and rewrote the book and lyrics. The result is largely a smashing success with a few missteps (the bullfighter in Bizet's piece becomes a heavyweight boxer here, which breaks up a certain grace in the  story) and a couple of perfect stretches (the long prelude to Carmen and Joe's first embrace, set on Carmen's home turf). Despite the fact that both Dandridge and Belafonte were singers, their vocal performances were  dubbed by LeVern Hutcherson and Marilyn Horne. (Yes, it is a little disconcerting to hear another voice come out of the more familiar Belafonte's mouth.) Otto Preminger directed with his usual eye on economy of action and production, as the numerous musical numbers tend to be shot in lengthy, single,  carefully choreographed takes. The result can be a little visually static at times, but the passion behind the singing pulls everything through.--Tom  Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 467747}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.65, "brand": "", "asin": "6303102425", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TGP1S6K4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Carmen Jones [VHS]"}

Beginning on the icy planet Krypton, the story follows the baby Kal-El, whose rocket ship lands in Smallville, Kansas. He is found there by a childless couple and raised as the shy Clark Kent (the young Kent is played by Jeff East). The film is perhaps most touching in these sequences, with expanses of wheat fields blowing in the wind and with a young man who can't figure out what part in destiny his great powers are meant to play. The second half, with Reeve taking over as Clark/Superman, is bustling, enchanting (the scene in which Superman flies girlfriend Lois Lane--played by Margot Kidder--through the night sky is great date material), and funny, thanks largely to Gene Hackman's sardonic portrayal of nemesis Lex Luthor.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300268993", "B000059XYC", "6300270122", "6303020089", "B000059XXZ", "0784011923", "B0002XNSYA", "B00005A1VG", "6303506291", "6301969413", "0800198395", "6302941318", "6304509154", "630196649X", "6304508611", "0790731975", "0790700506", "6300181537", "B000059XY5", "0790733897", "B00000JGEI", "6300214311", "6304047843", "6302238331", "6300214060", "630407185X", "6303148352", "6303212379", "6302510023", "0783216084", "B00004TYS8", "6302380294", "0790744589", "0792133153", "6302091632", "6302098424", "6304143184", "B0000068SI", "B00004RNAC", "6302510031", "630251018X", "6302510015", "B0000CDL3W", "6302510198", "B0001VL30O", "B000006FNX", "6302909023", "B000065U6Q", "6302032377"], "bought_together": ["6300268993", "B000059XYC"], "also_viewed": ["B000IJ79WU", "6300268993", "B000059Z8K", "B000P6XQ50", "B0039208JE", "6300270122", "B000IJ79VQ", "B000059XYC", "B000IJ79X4", "B001DJLD2G", "B000059XXZ", "B00F4FFO8E", "B00005JKCH", "6302642248", "6303953425", "B00005LIRF", "B00EAPMGIU", "B000IJ79XE", "B00BBND56G", "0790734079", "0784011923", "B000VI70QS", "B00005LKLF", "B000059Z8L", "B000UR9T8C", "B00005JXY3", "B0039208QM", "6303506291", "B0016MOWOQ", "B0087F7VSY", "B00000GUNY", "0783222726", "B00DYEN6XC", "B00E5I2MCM", "B0090SI582", "B00JPS6A3O", "B0057R5XRG", "B008JFUO72", "B008JFUS0U"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 202304}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.75, "brand": "", "asin": "6303212263", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51E39PXF9BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Superman the Movie [VHS]"}

Scott now has to deal with his suspicious ex-wife (Wendy  Crewson,Air Force One) and her psychiatrist boyfriend (Judge Reinhold,Beverly Hills Cop), who both think he's playing tricks with Charlie's  mind, and also with his own out-of-control body, which is putting on weight and  growing a prodigious beard.The Santa Clauseprobably won't supplantIt's a Wonderful LifeorMiracle on 34th Streetas anyone's  favorite holiday film, but it's an enjoyable, straightforward family film,  anchored by the affable charisma of Allen.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008X5J8", "B00005LOUS", "6302091632", "6304501153", "B000OLGCIE", "B0002F6BQU", "0788802194", "B00008X5J7", "0788809806", "6304089767", "0788812807", "B00000JKNP", "6301969707", "6302765536", "079070546X", "155890641X", "B00001YX9H", "0788805843", "0788803743", "0788812408", "6303983812", "6303122647", "6302526574", "B00003CX7L", "6304400551", "0793941520", "0307142450", "6302320402", "6302794331", "0307142469", "B00009L4S1", "6303314015", "6305229449", "6302961572", "6305326940", "6305515042", "0788812440", "B000056VP3", "0788812181", "B00000J2JC", "6304401132", "6304293968", "B000A468XY", "B000035Z46", "6303315305", "B00000J2JA", "6304089449", "B0007A2GSM", "B00008X5J6", "6303952763", "B00007AJLF", "6303804357", "6303929567", "6303052703", "B00006LPK3", "6303409997", "6303925235", "6302503795", "B000063V14", "6304231814", "6303614493", "B00004Y2PU", "6303929575", "B00003CXQ0", "B00001IVED", "B000028U3S", "6306010491", "6304209282", "6301995902", "6302648750", "0790732580", "6305942285", "B00005UF9D", "B00004WIBZ", "0783221800", "1560395737", "6304118937", "B00004T2SI", "0788810995", "B00005BCMY", "6304311834", "B0001AW0AC", "6303212379", "6301666569", "B00003CXQ6", "B00005JY0D", "B0001FR3GI", "0783230095", "B000093FH7", "B00005JLR1", "B00006953H", "6304489617", "0790732475", "6302705517", "6305198861", "0788810677", "1568322259"], "bought_together": ["B00008X5J8", "B000OLGCIE"], "also_viewed": ["6303314015", "6303929338", "B00005JKDQ", "6304089767", "0788805533", "B000035Z2S", "6302787068", "6303168957", "6301991311", "B00005KAQI", "6302968143", "6302526574", "0788812408", "6303534422", "6303983812", "6303109918", "B00008X5J7", "0788802194", "6302426200", "B0007KTBIU", "6305942285", "6302642248", "B00008X5J8", "6304290888", "B000OLGCIE", "6300275310", "6305198861", "6304400551", "6303925235", "B00007AJLB", "0788806270", "6302158095", "B00003CXQX", "B00005JLR1", "0788805843", "6303409997", "B00004T2SI", "6302091632", "0788809806", "6301390725", "6304416415", "6301404440", "0793941520", "6302320402", "6305940932", "6304401736", "6304500831", "6305177473", "B00006953H", "6301948106", "6302178924", "B000035Z46", "6303122647", "B00004R99N", "6303804357", "6304089627", "B00005JL95", "6304501153", "6302961572"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 269737}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6303442447", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/712N3XHW6AL._SY300_.gif", "title": "The Santa Clause [VHS]"}

{"description": "This film represents Hugh Grant's first big bid at Hollywood stardom, on the heels of the success ofFour Weddings and a Funeral. But he stumbled twice: first with this mundane comedy, then by being arrested after soliciting a prostitute near downtown Hollywood, the week before the film opened. Directed by Chris Columbus (Mrs. Doubtfire),Nine Monthswas a weak reworking of a French film about an aging bachelor (Grant)  who can't decide whether to commit to the woman he loves (Julianne Moore). When she becomes pregnant, he still can't make up his mind and winds up blowing hot and cold on the subject of fatherhood, which causes tension in the relationship. There's a lot of low comedy involving Grant's best friend; Tom Arnold plays this ultra-married and child-ridden suburbanite, who makes fatherhood look like a living hell. Robin Williams has a funny cameo as a foreign doctor, but in the end, the sentiment is ladled on and Grant doesn't have nearly enough funny material to work with.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_viewed": ["6303100864"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 513846}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.94, "brand": "", "asin": "6303890458", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41QM231ZPRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Nine Months [VHS]"}

That same president, late in the film, personally flies a jet fighter to deliver a payload of missiles against an attack by extraterrestrials.Independence Dayis the kind of movie so giddy with its own outrageousness that one doesn't even blink at such howlers in the plot. Directed by Roland Emmerich,Independence Dayis a pastiche of conventions from flying-saucer movies from the 1940s and 1950s, replete with icky monsters and bizarre coincidences that create convenient shortcuts in the story. (Such as the way the girlfriend of one of the film's heroes--played by Will Smith--just happens to run across the president's injured wife, who are then both rescued by Smith's character who somehow runs across them in alien-ravaged Los Angeles County.) The movie is just sheer fun, aided by a cast that knows how to balance the retro requirements of the genre with a more contemporary feel.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303148352", "6301792734", "6302610702", "6304169558", "B00005JKZ2", "B00007JME0", "0800132009", "B0002MB7R6", "6305169187", "080010367X", "6303257844", "6300215830", "B000062XM6"], "bought_together": ["6303148352"], "also_viewed": ["0800125762", "080010367X", "6300213668", "6303049079", "6303257844", "6304169558", "630382790X", "B00000JGEI", "6305169187", "6300214060", "6301792734", "0792116887", "6304089767", "B0002MB7R6", "B00003CX8I", "6304290888", "B000062XM6", "0792107128", "B00005B238", "630339406X", "B00000IQV1", "6302936381", "155890641X", "6302415853", "6303506291", "6301796535", "6301208773", "B000006FYP", "6305750750", "6302516986", "0792151712", "0767825411", "6302642248", "6301963725", "6303215734", "080018789X", "6303614493", "6303675220", "B00005JM5E", "6304500831", "B000096IB6", "B00000K3AN", "6302091632", "0783229011", "B0087F7VSY", "B00HF98SJY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 266473}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6304233639", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71TEN1TNW7L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Independence Day [VHS]"}

{"description": "George Romero's 1978 follow-up to his classicNight of the Living Deadis quite terrifying and gory (those zombies do like the taste of living flesh). But in its own way, it is just as comically satiric as the first film in its take on contemporary values. This time, we follow the fortunes of four people who lock themselves inside a shopping mall to get away from the marauding dead and who then immerse themselves in unabashed consumerism, taking what they want from an array of clothing and jewelry shops, making gourmet meals, etc. It is Romero's take on Louis XVI in the modern world: keep the starving masses at bay and crank up the insulated indulgence.

{"description": "This soapy but highly watchable television \"sequel\" toGone with the Wind, the most popular Hollywood movie ever made, has nothing to do with memories of a vanished antebellum South. But it does end up in Ireland, where the determined Scarlett O'Hara Butler (played with frosty passion by Joanne Whalley-Kilmer) turns hard times into an opportunity by buying the ancestral home of her family. Before that happens, however, Scarlett fights to win back the estranged Rhett Butler (manfully portrayed by Timothy Dalton), often seen in the company of other women, struggles for control over the homestead Tara, and gets caught in yet another compromising position with poor Ashley Wilkes (Stephen Collins). The troubles never stop (Scarlett's Ireland adventures land her in a heap of trouble from which only Rhett can save her), but this TV miniseries wisely keeps the focus on these captivating characters, their entangled histories, and the collective destiny that refuses to part them. The show also looks good: the location scenes in Ireland are particularly handsome, and there is something unaccountably satisfying about seeing Scarlett and Rhett walking through peaceful green hills.

{"description": "Romance at its most anti-romantic--that is the Billy Wilder stamp of genius, and this Best Picture Academy Award winner from 1960 is no exception. Set in a decidedly unsavory world of corporate climbing and philandering, the great filmmaker's trenchant, witty satire-melodrama takes the office politics of a corporation and plays them out in the apartment of lonely clerk C.C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon). By lending out his digs to the higher-ups for nightly extramarital flings with their secretaries, Baxter has managed to ascend the business ladder faster than even he imagined. The story turns even uglier, though, when Baxter's crush on the building's melancholy elevator operator (Shirley MacLaine) runs up against her long-standing affair with the big boss (a superbly smarmy Fred MacMurray). The situation comes to a head when she tries to commit suicide in Baxter's apartment. Not the happiest or cleanest of scenarios, and one that earned the famously caustic and cynically humored Wilder his share of outraged responses, but looking at it now, it is a funny, startlingly clear-eyed vision of urban emptiness and is unfailingly understanding of the crazy decisions our hearts sometimes make. Lemmon and MacLaine are ideally matched, and while everyone cites Wilder'sSome Like It Hotclosing line \"Nobody's perfect\" as his best, MacLaine's no-nonsense final words--\"Shut up and deal\"--are every bit as memorable. Wilder won three Oscars forThe Apartment, for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay (cowritten with longtime collaborator I.A.L. Diamond).--Robert Abele", "related": {"also_bought": ["1558807780", "6300216233", "6304039530", "0800113055", "6301607929", "6301973259", "6300183890", "6302226899", "6300183513", "6301973232", "6300268470", "6301670159", "6301798503", "6300215644", "630266232X", "6304039522", "0782008348", "0783236352", "B00000GJ2B", "6301670140", "0792108868", "630196912X", "0790743213", "B0000040EO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 362176}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.39, "brand": "", "asin": "6304308388", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VQCSN36TL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Apartment [VHS]"}

As Jean-Michel's work gained favorable attention from New York's elite art community, he went from a street punk living in a cardboard box to the first black artist to succeed in the all-white dominated art world. Tony Award-winning actor Jeffrey Wright does a brilliant job portraying a man tortured by self-doubt and thoughts of suicide, struggling to survive and be acknowledged as an artist.

{"description": "Veronica Sawyer (Winona Ryder) has sacrificed everything in order to preserve her place in Westerburg High's most impenetrable social clique, the HEATHERS. As the only member of the group not named \"Heather\", Veronica has to work extra hard just to stay afloat. Going against her own morals and intelligence, Veronica succumbs to peer pressure on a daily basis, faking her delight in the humiliation of the school's less popular students. Bored of the frat parties and cow tipping so popular among her friends, Veronica's curiosity is peaked when a mysterious new guy named J.D. comes to town. The dark, brooding J.D. (Christian Slater at his best) observes Veronica among her pack in the lunchroom (where social hierarchy is most clearly displayed), concluding that Veronica is not a Heather at heart. When Veronica confides in J.D. that she hates her friends and wishes Heather #1 was dead, she never expects her words to have such dire consequences. Before she knows what's happening, J.D. is dragging Veronica on a killing spree staged as a teen suicide outbreak. But as Veronica soon learns, even death cannot stop the HEATHERS. As one Heather dies, her red scrunchee (the symbol of all power) gets passed on to the next Heather in line, and the clique that was the HEATHERS starts to feel like an inescapable social disease. How far will this war for popularity go? By far the darkest of teen comedies, HEATHERS invented a vocabulary of teen-speak all its own, asking questions like \"What's your damage?\" and introducing phrases like \"How very\". Director Michael Lehmann successfully blends the horror, comedy, and teen movie genres, creating a truly original film. Full of dark humor and deeply sardonic messages, HEATHERS takes a fresh look at the often-sugarcoated cinematic world of high school. Set in the 1980's, the film feels timeless in its relevance because of the daring nature of its themes.", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300183416", "B00005T33W", "0767819586", "B000065RCD"], "bought_together": ["6300183416"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 590283}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.94, "brand": "", "asin": "6304361009", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BZA4724XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Heathers [VHS]"}

{"description": "A grandly entertaining, old-fashioned adventure based on the Rudyard Kipling short story,The Man Who Would Be Kingis the kind of rousing epic about which people said, even in 1975, &quot;Wow! They don't make 'em like that anymore!&quot; When director John Huston (The Maltese Falcon,The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,The African Queen) first started trying to make the film, with Gable and Bogart, the project was derailed by the latter's death. It was a few decades before Huston was able to finally realize his dream movie--and with an unimprovable cast. Sean Connery and Michael Caine are, respectively, Daniel Dravot and Peachy Carnahan, a pair of lovably roguish British soldiers who set out to make their fortunes by conning the priests of remote Kafiristan into making them kings. It's a rollicking tale, an epic satire of imperialism, and the good-natured repartee shared by Caine and Connery is pure gold. In today's screen adventures, humor is usually imposed on the material by a writer or director trying to make some kind of cleverly self-aware comment (&quot;Hey, we know it's a movie!&quot;), but that sort of jokiness can create so much ironic distance that it pushes the audience right out of the picture.

{"description": "Decades ago, documentary filmmaker Leon Gast attempted to complete a feature about the 1974 \"Rumble in the Jungle\" championship bout between boxers Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in Kinshasa, Zaire. Sundry complications, though, held up the project until its release in 1996. It was well worth the delay. From Gast's perspective of modern history, the six weeks Ali and Foreman were forced to spend waiting in Africa for their fight to take place now looks like an important moment in America's cultural understanding of African American roots. In a nutshell, Ali had been stripped of his heavyweight champion title because his opposition to the Vietnam War-era draft had landed him in prison. Reigning champ Foreman agreed to a Don King-promoted match in Kinshasa, but after all parties got there the fight was put off. Gast captures the charismatic Ali, in the ensuing days and weeks, going out among the people and getting to know them while the more reclusive Foreman keeps to his own company. Meanwhile, King brings over black American artists such as James Brown and the Spinners to mix it up with African musicians. The sense of excitement and connection is thrilling, as is the boxing footage of Foreman and Ali finally taking swings at one another in a titanic duel. Writers George Plimpton and Norman Mailer, each of whom was covering the fight as journalists, are on hand to recollect the details. Whether you're a fight fan or not, this is a unique experience and a fascinating insight into America's sense of identity.--Tom Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 447868}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.79, "brand": "", "asin": "6304488297", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51W9FAZGTEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "When We Were Kings [VHS]"}

{"description": "It's not quite as clever as it tries to be, butThe Gamedoes a tremendous job of presenting the story of a rigid control freak trapped in circumstances that are increasingly beyond his control. Michael Douglas plays a rich, divorced, and dreadful investment banker whose 48th birthday reminds him of his father's suicide at the same age. He's locked in the cage of his own misery until his rebellious younger brother (Sean Penn) presents him with a birthday invitation to play \"The Game\" (described as \"an experiential Book of the Month Club\")--a mysterious offering from a company called Consumer Recreation Services. Before he knows the game has even begun, Douglas is caught up in a series of unexplained events designed to strip him of his tenuous security and cast him into a maelstrom of chaos. How do you play a game that hasn't any rules? That's what Douglas has to figure out, and he can't always rely on his intelligence to form logic out of what's happening to him. Seemingly cast as the fall guy in a conspiracy thriller, he encounters a waitress (Deborah Unger) who may or may not be trustworthy, and nothing can be taken at face value in a world turned upside down.

{"description": "The 1998 testosterone-saturated blow-'em-up from producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay (The Rock,Bad Boys) continues Hollywood's millennium-fueled fascination with the destruction of our planet. There's no arguing that the successful duo understands what mainstream American audiences want in their blockbuster movies--loads of loud, eye-popping special effects, rapid- fire pacing, and patriotic flag waving. Bay's protagonists--the eight crude, lewd, oversexed (but lovable, of course) oil drillers summoned to save the world from a Texas-sized meteor hurling toward the earth--are not flawless heroes, but common men with whom all can relate. In this huge Western-in-space soap opera, they're American cowboys turned astronauts. Sci-fi buffs will appreciate Bay's fetishizing of technology, even though it's apparent he doesn't understand it as anything more than flashing lights and shiny gadgets. Smartly, the duo also tries to lure the art-house crowd, raiding the local indie acting stable and populating the film with guys like Steve Buscemi, Billy Bob Thornton, Owen Wilson, and Michael Duncan, all adding needed touches of humor and charisma. When Bay applies his sledgehammer aesthetics to the action portions of the film, it's mindless fun; it's only whenArmageddontackles humanity that it becomes truly offensive. Not sinceMississippi Burninghave racial and cultural stereotypes been substituted for characters so blatantly--African Americans, Japanese, Chinese, Scottish, Samoans, Muslims, French ... if it's not white and American, Bay simplifies it. Or, make that whitemaleAmerica; the film features only three notable females--four if you count the meteor, who's constantly referred to as a \"bitch that needs drillin',\" but she's a hell of a lot more developed and unpredictable than the other women characters combined. Sure, Bay's film creates some tension and contains some visceral moments, but if he can't create any redeemable characters outside of those in space, what's the point of saving the planet?--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304681496", "6304233639", "0783222475", "0792845684", "B00003CXTF", "B00004WIDB", "B00000JGEN", "0792151712", "B000007OY0", "B0001DI5W6", "0783222955", "6302610702", "079213690X", "6302909023", "6300215830", "6301976622", "6301643410"], "bought_together": ["6304681496"], "also_viewed": ["6301398912", "630382790X", "6304233639", "6300214540", "6303257844", "B000003KHS", "0792151712", "B000059XYK", "0800125762", "B00005JM5E", "6302415853", "B00005PJ8I", "0783241542", "B00003CXTF"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 194393}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.38, "brand": "Touchstone Home Video", "asin": "6305169187", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515Y886RQYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Armageddon [VHS]"}

{"description": "One of the most endearing and intelligent romantic comedies of the '90s, the Oscar-winningShakespeare in Loveis filled with such good will, sunny romance, snappy one-liners, and devilish cleverness that it's absolutely irresistible. With tongue placed firmly in cheek, at its outset the film tracks young Will Shakespeare's overwrought battle with writer's block and the efforts of theater owner Philip Henslowe (Geoffrey Rush, in rare form) to stage Will's latest comedy,Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter. Jokey comedy, though, soon takes a backseat to ravishing romance when the beautiful Viola De Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow) disguises herself as a young man to wangle herself an audition in the all-male cast, and wins both the part of Romeo and, after much misunderstanding, the playwright's heart. Soon enough, Will's pirate comedy becomes the beautiful, tragicRomeo and Juliet, reflecting the agony and ecstasy of Will and Viola's romance--he's married and she's set to marry the slimy Lord Wessex (Colin Firth) in the near future.The way that Oscar-winning screenwriters Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard enfold their story within the parameters ofRomeo and Juliet(and evenTwelfth Night) is nothing short of brilliant--it would take a Shakespearean scholar to dissect the innumerable parallels, oft-quoted lines, plot developments, and thematic borrowings. And most amazingly, Norman and Stoppard haven't forgotten to entertain their audience in addition to riding a Shakespearean roller coaster, with director John Madden (Mrs. Brown) reigning in his huge ensemble with rollicking energy. Along the way there are small gems to be found, including Judi Dench's eight-minute, Oscar-winning turn as atrulyregal Queen Elizabeth, but the key element ofShakespeare in Love's success rests on the milky-white shoulders of its two stars. Fiennes, inexplicably overlooked at Oscar time, is a dashing, heartfelt Will, and as for Best Actress winner Paltrow, well, nothing she'd done before could have prepared viewers for how amazing she is here. Breathtakingly beautiful, fiercely intelligent, strong-willed, and lovestruck--it's a performance worthy of Shakespeare in more ways than one. By the film's end, you'll be thoroughly won over--and brushing up your Shakespeare with newfound ardor.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790734060", "6304071876"], "also_viewed": ["B00006FN65"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 406033}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.72, "brand": "", "asin": "6305470448", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q5DABSM6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Shakespeare in Love [VHS]"}

{"description": "Matthew Broderick makes up for years of wet-noodle performances with his low-key but unsparing characterization of Jim McAllister, a high school teacher at George Washington Carver High School in Omaha, Nebraska. Driven by a strange mixture of loathing and lust for pathologically overachieving student Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon), McAllister encourages a dim but popular athlete, Paul (Chris Klein fromAmerican Pie), to run against her in the election for student-council president. Director-cowriter Alexander Payne (Citizen Ruth) turns this deceptively simple premise into a complex and scathing comedy of ambition, corruption, and desire, all at its most naked and petty. Every scene contains some painfully funny nuance that will make you wince in a mixture of astonishment and empathy. Witherspoon flips effortlessly back and forth from adolescent vulnerability to steely-eyed strength; she's becoming a contemporary Carole Lombard. The movie itself feels like a magnificent throwback to the richly layered comedies of the '30s, which drew their humor from sharply drawn characters and twisting plots instead of explosions of bodily fluids. With a wealth of smart, cutting details,Electionrewards multiple viewing.--Bret Fetzer", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 397935}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.5, "brand": "", "asin": "6305574928", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/216DM4ARS6L.jpg", "title": "Election [VHS]"}
{"description": "Sean Connery plays a master thief thought to be long retired, while Catherine Zeta-Jones is his foil, a hotshot insurance investigator assigned to his case. They both have a little something to hold over each other's heads, until it turns out that Zeta-Jones is a professional art thief herself and is playing on both sides of the fence. At first they eye each other with mutual distrust until they team up for a job, which goes off without a hitch. Inevitably their prickly relationship begins to thaw somewhat, and the two become attracted to each other as they plan out the massive Y2K bank scam that is the movie's climax (complete with sequel-ready ending).Entrapmentplays somewhat like a '70s caper movie revamped for the gadget-happy high-tech '90s. The plot takes a few too many labored twists and turns, and the chemistry between the two leads is nearly nonexistent, though both carry on gamely in their parts. On the other hand, there is some genuine suspense in many scenes as they go about their business, dripping with whiz-bang burglary devices. Zeta-Jones, of course, is drop-dead gorgeous, and Connery is as reliable as always in his role. The fairly flat editing and direction tends to drag the film down somewhat, but fans of caper movies, high-tech thrillers, and the two leads should find plenty to like in this film.--Jerry Renshaw", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006IUNT", "6304925131", "079212569X", "0792133153", "0792116887", "B0000048TX", "6303696813", "0790731975", "6303313345", "6304258984", "0783223218", "0800125762", "B00004WIDB", "B00000IO4G", "0783216084", "6303020089", "0790748169", "6300183211"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 212089}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6305622825", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/7179VDAPNGL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Entrapment [VHS]"}
{"description": "\"I have a bad feeling about this,\" says the young Obi-Wan Kenobi  (played by Ewan McGregor) inStar Wars: Episode I, The Phantom  Menaceas he steps off a spaceship and into the most anticipated cinematic event... well, ever. He might as well be speaking for the  legions of fans of the original episodes in theStar Warssaga  who can't help but secretly ask themselves: Sure, this isStar  Wars, but is itmy Star Wars? The original elevated  moviegoers' expectations so high that it would have been impossible for  any subsequent film to meet them. And as with all theStar Warsmovies,The Phantom Menacefeatures inexplicable plot twists, a  fistful of loose threads, and some cheek-chewing dialogue. Han Solo's  swagger is sorely missed, as is the pervading menace of heavy-breathing  Darth Vader. There is still way too much quasi-mystical mumbo jumbo,  and some of what was fresh aboutStar Wars22 years earlier  feels formulaic. Yet there's much to admire. The special effects are  stupendous; three worlds are populated with a m&eacute;lange of creatures, flora, and horizons rendered in absolute  detail. The action and battle scenes are breathtaking in their  complexity. And one particular sequence of the film--the  adrenaline-infused pod race through the Tatooine desert--makes the chariot race inBen-Hurlook like a Sunday stroll through the park.Among the host of new characters, there are a few familiar walk-ons. We  witness the first meeting between R2-D2 and C-3PO, Jabba the Hutt looks  younger and slimmer (but not young and slim), and Yoda is as crabby as  ever. Natalie Portman's stately Queen Amidala sports hairdos that make  Princess Leia look dowdy and wields a mean laser. We never bond with  Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson), and Obi-Wan's day is yet to come. Jar Jar Binks, a cross  between a Muppet, a frog, and a hippie, provides many of the movie's lighter moments, while Sith Lord Darth  Maul is a formidable force. Baby-faced Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) looks too young  and innocent to command the powers of the Force or wield a lightsaber (much less transmute into the future Darth Vader), but his  boyish exuberance wins over skeptics.Near the end of the movie, Palpatine, the new leader of the Republic,  may be speaking for fans eagerly awaitingEpisode IIwhen he  pats young Anakin on the head and says, \"We will watch your career with  great interest.\" Indeed! --Tod Nelson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000633ZP", "6301792734", "B00005JLXH", "B00006HBUJ", "6304539258", "6304539274", "6301792769", "B000FQVX78", "6304539290", "0792158261", "B000FQJAJG", "6304117752", "0767729307", "B001GQSY5K", "6304178352", "B000FAGGWQ", "B00BBND56G", "B000FQJAIW", "B00005LL26", "B00003CXCT", "B00003CXI0", "B002I9Z8AS", "B00006AL1C", "B00CFWWDWE", "B000066HAS", "B000001ON6", "B000MUANT6", "6305587159"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLXH", "B00006HBUJ"], "also_viewed": ["B00006HBUJ", "B00005JLXH", "B00E9PMML2", "B0000633ZP", "6301792734", "B00BBND56G", "6304539258", "6301792769", "6304539274", "B00006JDUE", "0767729307", "B00E9PMMX0", "B000FQJAIW", "B000FQVX78", "B000FQJAJG", "B00000IQMT", "B000FAGGWQ", "B003ZSJ212", "0345434110", "6303148352", "6304089767", "0439834775", "6304117752", "B00BUZW14M", "6304500831", "0590010891", "0345341465", "6304434340", "B001GQSY5K", "155890641X", "B00005LL26", "6302961572", "0792151712", "B003W77SEO", "B000M4Y8JI", "0767825411", "B00003CXXI", "B00000IZ8A", "B00169IZN8", "6302787068", "B00006G8LB", "080010367X", "0800125762", "6302091632", "0792158261", "B000850IS6", "6300214826", "6303506291", "B00005V1Z8", "B000641D2Y", "0784011923", "B00008Y47S", "6300214060", "630382790X", "B00003CXI0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 79460}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.44, "brand": "Star Wars", "asin": "630575067X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41SJPKK4S4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Wars - Episode I, The Phantom Menace [VHS]"}
{"description": "Noted for intimate character studies created in collaboration with his actors, director Mike Leigh makes a dramatic change of pace with this biography of comic opera composers W.S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan. Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) is an easily angered but otherwise emotionally remote lyricist who works in collaboration with composer Sullivan (Alan Corduner), a genial and fun-loving sort who feels unsatisfied writing light operettas and longs to work with more serious material. While Sullivan is having a creative crisis, Gilbert is facing a failing marriage to Lucy (Lesley Manville), who loves her husband even if he can't return her affections, and must deal with his ailing father (Charles Simon). When they suffer their first failure, both men are depressed, and Sullivan announces that he's giving up operetta for good. However, a visit to an exhibit of Japanese art sparks an idea in Gilbert, and soon he and Sullivan are hard at work on what will become one of their greatest successes, The Mikado. Much of the film is devoted to the staging of this classic, with Shirley Henderson, Dorothy Atkinson, Martin Savage, Timothy Spall, and Kevin McKidd as members of the operetta's cast.

{"description": "This complex and intriguing drama chronicles--with some probable narrative liberties--the chain of events that instigated the provocative Profumo affair, the infamous cold war scandal that toppled Britain's conservative government in the early 1960s. John Hurt stars as charming osteopath Stephen Ward, who grooms a malleable and beautiful teen showgirl, Christine Keeler (Joanne Whalley-Kilmer), to party with his swinging high-society friends. Trouble starts brewing when Christine becomes simultaneously entangled with both a Russian diplomat and a British cabinet minister. Once the media learn of her sexual escapades, the reigning Conservative Party comes under fire and begins seeking a scapegoat to distract the public from the dangerous political implications that the affairs represent. Under Michael Caton-Jones's confident direction, the film generates sympathy for its decadent lead characters, and it intelligently explores how private personal matters become vulgar public affairs when political machinations intrude. The most intriguing aspect ofScandalis the platonic love affair between Keeler and Ward amid the trials and tribulations of their stormy relationship--think of it as a twisted variation onMy Fair Lady. The fine cast also includes Ian McKellan as John Profumo and Bridget Fonda as Christine's partner-in-fun Mandy Rice-Davies. The uncut DVD version features a little more skin than the R-rated release, although viewers will probably wonder why those few extra shots caused such a stir.--Bryan Reesman", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790750643", "B000053VAT", "B0016I0AKU", "B00004ZBVM", "B00K2CHUWW", "B00AEFYD2M", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B0049TVHSC", "0007435851", "B00GRZPRB4", "0224023470", "B004ULEENE", "B00FR23S3W", "B0007W6HVM", "B007MDB6Y2", "B00005B8U4", "B00006L91I", "B009M7PR5A", "B004YMATCY", "B0045O2PHS", "B000QXDFRG", "B002UJIY2A", "B004SUDQC2", "B0000D0YXV", "B006M3M5FM", "B007RGB58G", "B00005JMU1", "B00005U2K5", "B00000DTOM", "B005VUTRGW", "B00IVLRC88", "B002E01M8I", "B00008L3S6", "B00DL48BM6", "B00J5LXT44", "B0002V7O5Q", "B0012IV3Q4", "B00GS08Y3Q", "B00ET2ODTE", "B00005K3NU", "B00HF98SPS", "B004SIP9CO", "B0047DKLCI", "B003Z8ZC2A", "149093989X", "B005ZVIPG0", "B000SKU04S", "B00EP2SN58", "6305428522", "B00J5364N0", "B00EVU3T26", "B004OUZLGA", "B00EALTWHW", "B008SGVSMM", "B008RO6PJQ", "B00004TWZH", "B0000BXMZ3", "B00007ELDG", "B00ESZZOLI", "B000A7Q1UQ", "B000HT3QBO", "B0047UJBJA", "B001EOQCJE", "B004KNO798", "B00004ZBVO", "1843587556", "B001E0ADF2", "0330481673", "B00014K5YG", "B00009YXHG", "B000CBG5PG", "B00005R5GD", "B00020X88Y", "B00GPPXNIK", "B006Z7Z3VS", "B002ONC9NC", "B00013RC66", "B001CW7ZT4", "B00AZESO72", "0792846486", "B00049QJBG", "B00005V9HM", "B00014NE62", "1452122199", "B00005U2KC", "B00AN5LCXQ", "B00003CXSA", "B00005K3NV", "B003EYVXSW", "B005UVTTOM", "B001AXL67W", "B00FMGPWD2", "B00AEK9BKQ", "B00005JMIJ", "B006OT0UUQ", "B000059TG7", "B00GICP84W", "0792845803"], "bought_together": ["B007MDB6Y2", "B009M7PR5A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007MDB6Y2", "B009M7PR5A", "B00FR23S3W", "B0016I0AKU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 195343}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 54.5, "brand": "", "asin": "6305971196", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/415XT0KB44L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Scandal"}

His only solace is his lover, Marie  (Eva Mattes)--so when he begins to suspect her of infidelity, his jealousy  swiftly turns murderous.

{"description": "This DVD is packed with extras designed for kids and special-effects enthusiastics. Stuart himself hosts the extras, guiding the viewer through the special menus. A favorite with the kids will probably be the game asking questions about the movie. Using clips from the movie and three different levels, it's quite appealing. As for meatier things, there is a curious look at animators' \"tryouts\" in creating Stuart, plus excellent demonstrations of how Stuart interacts with humans, using multiple images and commentary. Another highlight is seeing the first conceptual drawings of the boat race, vastly different from the final sequence. There are two commentary tracks on the film, one with the visual-effects team revealing their secrets and the other with the engaging director, Rob Minkoff. Also including  short documentaries, music videos, and a read-along book with Stuart,  this is a rare disc because the kids will like the extras as much as the film.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JLGM", "B000M343BC", "B00003CXJ4", "B000CQ98FU", "B00AEFXMSS", "B004HO6I4M", "B0006JMLRK", "B002WJI2QQ", "B000MV9026", "B0012EM5D8", "B001DPHDCY", "B004EPZ034", "6305161887", "B00005JNQS", "0783231474", "B005SDUV4E", "B0006UEVT0", "B00CWM58WY", "B0000AOX0O", "B000065V42", "B00000JL8E", "B0000VV4W2", "B005F96UJ6", "B00029LO0Y", "0783219806", "0783219733", "B0000VCZKW", "B00H5NY7O0", "B0000AK7AB", "B00009YXAW", "B000RMJ4F8", "B00AEFYO08", "B00GT85OLC", "B00005JG6M", "B000UVKGPI", "B000XKW2WG", "B003L4Y5BW", "B001U3D88M", "0064400565", "B00005JM7T", "B000ION23A", "B007FF3HQM", "B0006J28MI", "B000EOMB9U", "B0018ATR2S", "B00005LB87", "B002GHHHNS", "B001GCUNWQ", "B005LAIIT4", "B003R2BWJG", "B00005JMQZ", "B000056H26", "B000LPS2VI", "B0084IHVUC", "B004LWZW9W", "B008R65XKG", "B00EBBGLFC", "B00028HBES", "B0030ZIZRC", "B004AKCME8", "B00AEFXMGU", "B001LPWGFA", "0783232292", "B0000VCZKM", "B005LAIISA", "B000U1ZV5I", "B000NQRV4Y", "B000CZ0PT4", "B00JK531ES", "B008R65XPQ", "B001P4Q3CY", "B0000UJDLM", "B00003CXG7", "B00B7EQPNE", "B001ILFUD2", "B000J10FLY", "B000AY74OG", "B0042U94UQ", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00K2CHSS8", "B008NNY9QW", "B00006LPHB", "B000V5IP6U", "B00HLTD2OE", "B0009NZ2KG", "B000P0J09W", "B00365F6I2", "B000A2WAQK", "B00F522C7C", "B007R6DJP8", "B0087F7VSY", "B000Y11B7G", "B0039N74CW", "B00005JMFH", "B0016Q2D5M", "B003H9M1Q2", "B00005JLR2", "B000H5TH2A", "B00DV2MVWO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004HO6I4M", "B00CWM58WY", "B004EPZ034", "B000H5TH2A"]}, "price": 12.86, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 149960}, "asin": "B00000F7AE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YZM5J2MJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Stuart Little (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "\"I put the grrr in swinger, baby!\" a deliciously randy Austin Powers coos near the beginning ofThe Spy Who Shagged Me, and if the imagination of Austin creator Mike Myers seems to have sagged a bit, his energy surely hasn't. This friendly, go-for-broke sequel to 1997'sAustin Powers: International Man of Mysteryfinds our man Austin heading back to the '60s to keep perennial nemesis Dr.&nbsp;Evil (Myers again) from blowing up the world--and, more importantly, to get back his mojo, that man-juice that turns Austin into irresistible catnip for women, especially American spygirl Felicity Shagwell (a pretty but vacant Heather Graham). The plot may be irreverent and illogical, the jokes may be bad (with characters named Ivana Humpalot and Robin Swallows, n&eacute;e Spitz), and the scenes may run on too long, but it's all delivered sunnily and with tongue firmly in cheek.Myers's true triumph, though, is his turn as the neurotic Dr.&nbsp;Evil, who tends to spout the right cultural reference at exactly the wrong time (referring to his moon base as a \"Death Star\" with Moon Units Alpha and Zappa--in 1969). Myers teams Dr.&nbsp;Evil with a diminutive clone, Mini-Me (Verne&nbsp;J. Troyer),  who soon replaces slacker son Scott Evil (Seth Green) as the apple of the doctor's eye; Myers and Troyer work magic in what could plausibly be one of the year's most affecting (and hysterically funny) love stories. Despite a stellar supporting cast--including a sly Rob Lowe as Robert Wagner's younger self and Mindy Sterling as the forbidding Frau Farbissina--it's basically Myers's show, and he pulls a hat trick by playing a third character, the obese and disgusting Scottish assassin Fat Bastard. Many viewers will reel in disgust at Mr.&nbsp;Bastard's repulsive antics and the scatological bent Myers indulges in, including one showstopper involving coffee and--shudder--a stool sample. Still, Myers's good humor and dead-on cultural references win the day; Austin is one spy who proves he can still shag like a minx.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"bought_together": ["0780619552", "B00006WUWP"], "also_viewed": ["B008MIMWOO", "0780619552", "6303402348"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 58352}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.5, "brand": "", "asin": "B00001U0BK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KP9SFVSGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me [VHS]"}

{"description": "As revisionist history, Michael Mann's intelligent docudramaThe Insideris a simmering brew of altered facts and dramatic license. In a broader perspective, however, the film (cowritten withForrest GumpOscar-winner Eric Roth) is effectively accurate as an engrossing study of ethics in the corruptible industries of tobacco and broadcast journalism. On one side, there is Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe), the former tobacco scientist who violated contractual agreements to expose Brown & Williamson's inclusion of addictive ingredients in cigarettes, casting himself into a vortex of moral dilemma. On the other side is60&nbsp;Minutesproducer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), whose struggle to report Wigand's story puts him at odds with veteran correspondent Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer) and senior executives at CBS News.As the urgency of the story increases, so does the film's palpable sense of paranoia, inviting favorable comparison toAll the President's Men. While Pacino downplays the theatrical excess that plagued him in previous roles, Crow is superb as a man who retains his tortured integrity at great personal cost.The Insideris two movies--a cover-up thriller and a drama about journalistic ethics--that combine to embrace the noble values personified by Wigand and Bergman. Even if the details aren't always precise (as Mike Wallace and others protested prior to the film's release), the film adheres to a higher truth that was so blatantly violated by tobacco executives seen in an oft-repeated video clip, lying under oath in the service of greed.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002DU39GW", "B00005BCKF", "0470499052", "0314277447", "B0002XNT12", "0314904573", "B0038Z5T4Q", "074945332X", "B00337KM2S", "B003L20IG0", "630542828X", "0205667503", "B001N44BVQ", "B000H0MKOC", "B000CNESTE", "B00121QGPY", "B00441GYPG", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00004YA78", "B0001HLVS2", "B00BTYOYG2", "B000CEXEWA", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005JKG9", "B00AEFXYJA", "B000085OXZ", "B00BB67UNW", "B0035JHYGQ", "B00003CXFV", "B00004Y7Y4", "B00005JLX2", "B00AEBB95K", "B000XR9L50", "B000LXHK2C", "B000CNESU8", "B00441GYOM", "B00003CWUX", "B00A2H9VKG", "B002VWNICC", "B001AS32QK", "B000059TFO", "0780622561", "B002CPMB9O", "B0000296JH", "007337959X", "B000ARTN3I", "B002O3Z4WU", "B004SIP6C2", "B0000AM6JI", "B000OYAT3U", "B005FITIGO", "B00005JKMQ", "B0034G4P7G", "0792838947", "B00008CMRK", "B00003CXP7", "B000CQLZ8S", "B00004Z1FL", "B0001907AI", "B004SUDQ1S", "B00CLH0848", "0767817710", "B00007G1YQ", "B00008R9KG", "B000C3L2IO", "B0031OCY2E", "B00127RAGC", "B003U0AHBO", "B00JBGSHSQ", "B004IFYMWK", "B00004XPPB", "B0009OUBC4", "B004U7MR1Y", "B00008BNTD", "B001EJW0SG", "0783226845", "B003LR5BD0", "6304696507", "B0001I56FA", "B00DDY45DI", "B00GUO2SKA", "B0000YEEGM", "B000HT38IK", "B00006RCNV", "B000UGBOT0", "B000A9QK5K", "B000A9QK6E", "B00IJS2OHM", "B006DHATE6", "B0002J4X2K", "B000MXPE7O", "B004SIP7TE", "6305428115", "B00BLF9FYA", "B00AEBB9EG", "B0036TGSR6", "0783229402", "B00005BCK9", "B00004RE27"], "bought_together": ["B002DU39GW", "B003L20IG0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002DU39GW", "B000Y11B8U", "B003L20IG0", "B00005JN2Z"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17334}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.75, "brand": "Disney", "asin": "B00003CWRX", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y28RGA5AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Insider"}

{"description": "This is where is the Lynchian nightmare began. Though he may have redefined surrealistic cinema in the 1980s and forever altered the face of television in the 90s, for many hardcore fans it is this infamous feature film debut that is David Lynch's crowning achievement. Many words have been used to describeEraserhead(weird, bizarre, frustrating, enlightening, significant, unwatchable, meaningless, and momentous), but there is no denying it is completely unforgettable. As a surreal work of art,Eraserheadeasily holds it own next to the works as Bu&ntilde;uel, Cocteau, and Dali. And like many surrealistic works, there is no clear answer on whatEraserhead\"means.\" But, if you are trying to find a simple, linear, plot inEraserhead, you are clearly missing the point. ForEraserheadis not simply a movie to view, but a true cinematic experience, like jumping into someone's nightmare and seeing it from their perspective.  Whether you see it as a meditation on the terror of being a new parent, the suffocating feeling of living in an increasingly vapid, industrial wasteland, or a nightmare about the fear of loneliness, the film easily holds up to multiple viewings. And since this film is a dark visual ride and a supreme aural achievement, this long awaited, new transfer is an absolute blessing for David Lynch fans who will finally get to see, hear and experienceEraserheadclearly on DVD.  Bizarre experiment? Surrealistic nightmare? Or a meaningless cult film?

{"description": "Schizoid serial killer Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) has  been captured at last, but a neurological seizure has rendered him  comatose, and FBI agent Peter Novak (Vince Vaughan) has no way to  determine the location of Stargher's latest and still-living victim. To  probe the secrets contained in Stargher's traumatized psyche, the FBI  recruits psychologist Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez), who has  mastered a new technology that allows her to enter the mind of another person. What she finds in Stargher's head is a  theater of the grotesque, which, as envisioned by first-time director  Tarsem Singh, is a smorgasbord of the surreal that borrows liberally  from the Brothers Quay, Czech animator Jan Svankmajer, Hieronymous  Bosch, Salvador Dali, and a surplus of other cannibalized sources.This provides one of the wildest, weirdest visual feasts ever committed  to film, andThe Cellearns a place among such movie mind-trips  as2001: A Space Odyssey,Altered States,What Dreams  May Come, andUn Chien Andalou. Is this a good thing? Sure,  if all you want is freakazoid eye-candy. If you're looking for emotional depth,  substantial plot, and artistic coherence,The Cellis sure to  disappoint. The pop-psychology pablum of Mark Protosevich's screenplay  would be laughable if it weren't given such somber significance, and  Singh's exploitative use of sadomasochistic imagery is repugnant (this  movie makesSevenlook tame), so you're better off marveling at  the nightmare visions that are realized with astonishing potency.The Cellis too shallow to stay in your head for long, but while  it's there, it's one hell of a show.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0026LYLTM", "B001BPJJ9G", "B003TRMLQM", "6305238065", "B00005UQ9W", "0767805763", "0783229402", "B000OYC7BW", "B008NNY8RM", "B000BMY2MO", "B0000CERP3", "B000O76ZQC", "B0045HCJSU", "B00006SFKM", "0767821629", "B000K4X5P8", "B00AEBBA2W", "B000VUFJ0K", "B00011CZRE", "B001MVYUR0", "B00009QUH4", "B000NQRR1Q", "B000TJ6PBK", "B00006HAWN", "B00009MGEM", "B00005R5GF", "B0018O4YT0", "B0001EFTTW", "B00441GYVK", "B00005NRO0", "B00000I1KK", "0783237413", "B00003CXKA", "B000063US5", "B00005ATQB", "B00441GYXI", "B002OVB9YE", "B00BTYNXJG", "B00000JSJC", "6305718954", "B0012680CQ", "B001JNNDJM", "B000GCFO0I", "B0037XPP8Y", "B00K57K2JM", "B004EPYZU8", "B00008EY9G", "B0000AC8LR", "B00AEFXW8I", "B00003CXXP", "B004SEUJOQ", "B001R3YRG2", "B00013RC7K", "B0000AVHCD", "6305313687", "B0016BO72O", "B00DW5IKYS", "B00005JOWW", "B00006FDCD", "B00003CXPS", "B007I1Q54O", "B00005JMWP", "B0009G3B0G", "B0006GAOMW", "B0007Y08QA", "B004P7CN7W", "B00005N5RM", "B00005JLWN", "B002VRNIZO", "B0001Z52RU", "B00005Q4CS", "B000069I1I", "B008HUSFXO", "B00AJXO56I", "B00BLN4UPG", "B0009X75J2", "B00006JDU8", "B003VA3JUO", "B00005JKLZ", "B000053UIF", "B00005V1WW", "0783229526", "B002KLQ2ZO", "0780622650", "B005FUTBWS", "B0006L0LOS", "0780627849", "0783240295", "B000LP6KNU", "B000U7169M", "B000RGN2JI", "B000GI3KGC", "B00003CY6P", "0767824954", "B0009A40ES", "B0002CX22E", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00005UQ9I", "B00003CWRF", "B00005N7Z1"], "bought_together": ["B0026LYLTM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001BPJJ9G", "B003TRMLQM", "B005CFBYW6", "B000A343RI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 25555}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 10.99, "brand": "New Line Studios", "asin": "B00003CXKM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2BF5HiVvcL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Cell (New Line Platinum Series)"}

The goofy plot's only half the fun; with  roles for Stiller's parents (Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara), dozens of  celebrity cameos, endlessly quotable dialogue, and improvisational  energy to spare,Zoolanderis very smart about being very stupid, easily matching theAustin Powersfranchise for inspired comedic lunacy.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFXJS6", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B0009HBPN0", "B00005JMYI", "B00AEFYPXY", "B000J4P9P8", "B00AEFYS2M", "B0016MOV92", "B000BKJ762", "B000BKVQS4", "B0006GANPA", "B00AEBBA2C", "B001G5T6GW", "B00AEBB9GY", "B00024JC4E", "B008220BGQ", "B00005JMW7", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B000WZEZGI", "B001J9KJ4I", "B001DPHDB0", "B008R65XTC", "B000035Z38", "B002ZG99H2", "B00005JKMN", "B000AP04L0", "B000A7DVR2", "B000ELJAEM", "B00466HN7M", "B00003CXO1", "B0000AKCKI", "B000089778", "B0083XXVFW", "6305161860", "B000M341QE", "B008R65XNS", "B000ADWDE8", "B002BIULKS", "B00AEFYM2S", "B002WY65VU", "B00AEFY854", "B008R65XUQ", "B00AEFZ8OY", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000G6BLW4", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B00004TJMW", "B00AEFY0F2", "B003CRM6PA", "B000XPU66U", "B003Y5H4ZW", "B00AEFXIUK", "B002ZG98B4", "B000HT386M", "B000085EFK", "B00287Z18Y", "B003VPX5Y4", "B002O3Z4YI", "B001UV4X8S", "B008JFUORW", "B0000AC8LR", "630529142X", "B00AEBB9DM", "B003Y5H5B0", "B004EPZ084", "B00005O3VC", "0800195175", "B0001Z4OXS", "B0000A02TZ", "B000Z8GZYW", "B002ZG980U", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00CE00ZV8", "B0074FURNE", "B004H83IM8", "B00005JL93", "B0036TGSIK", "B002T9H2LA", "B002P7UCJ0", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00003CXPS", "B00AEBBA2M", "B001OD4S50", "B0002F6BRE", "B00014NE9E", "B000FS9FCG", "B0019HQICW", "B003TY2SPO", "B00005JM20", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00068WOH8", "B00005OCJP", "B000MMMT9G", "B0018CNNV2", "B00004Z4WR", "B000P0J09M", "B00011CZRE", "B0009A40ES", "B000IZJZIU", "B001AGXEAG"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBB8FQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AMSNED0", "B00AEFYPXY", "B004EPZ084", "B00AEFYS2M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 80747}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.82, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B00003CXPJ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BF60YQ17L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Zoolander (Special Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "LikeSaving Private Ryan,Enemy at the Gatesopens with a  pivotal event of World War II--the German invasion of  Stalingrad--re-created in epic scale, as ill-trained Russian soldiers  face German attack or punitive execution if they flee from the enemy's  advance. Director Jean-Jacques Annaud captures this madness with urgent  authenticity, creating a massive context for a more intimate battle  waged amid the city's ruins. Embellished from its basis in fact, the  story shifts to an intense cat-and-mouse game between a Russian shepherd  raised to iconic fame and a German marksman whose skill is unmatched in  its lethal precision. Vassily Zaitzev (Jude Law) has been sniping Nazis  one bullet at a time, while the German Major Konig (Ed Harris) has been  assigned to kill Vassily and spare Hitler from further embarrassment.There's love in war as Vassily connects with a woman soldier (Rachel  Weisz), but she is also loved by Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), the Soviet  officer who promotes his friend Vassily as Russia's much-needed hero.  This romantic rivalry lends marginal interest to the central plot, but  it's not enough to make this a classic war film. Instead it's a taut,  well-made suspense thriller isolated within an epic battle, and although  Annaud and cowriter Alain Godard (drawing from William Craig's book and  David L. Robbins's novelThe War of the Rats) fail to connect  the parallel plots with any lasting impact, the production is never less  than impressive. Highly conventional but handled with intelligence and  superior craftsmanship, this is warfare as strategic entertainment,  without compromising warfare as a manmade hell on Earth.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFXRRO", "B004U7MQWY", "B00AEBBA36", "B00001ZWUS", "B0007KIFGE", "B000065U1N", "B0015D20FE", "B001KZOUU0", "B00005PJ8T", "079284646X", "B001TUZG4K", "B00005JPKE", "B000095WW8", "B00003CXHJ", "B009XTF8NI", "0792839730", "B000M4RG42", "B00005JK8K", "B000P0J09C", "B00275EGWY", "B00003CXTG", "B003ASLJOU", "B003ELKNH2", "B000EHSVSC", "B004C45AZU", "B00AEFXKUI", "B00004XPPG", "0142000000", "B0007TKNGA", "B00HEPE6MM", "B00B0U2SFE", "B00005N5S3", "B00005PJ8S", "B00AEFYBA6", "B00006CXSS", "B00005ASGB", "B002ZG97RE", "B0007TKNLA", "0767802470", "B00IVLR9JA", "B00A34LX2M", "B00AEFY0F2", "0767817745", "B001LMAK9M", "B0000542CK", "B005LAIGYQ", "B000EHSVS2", "B00AEBB86U", "B00D3XMA9A", "B0000714C4", "B000XR9L50", "B000H1RFSM", "B005E2YL3Q", "B004TXFFI6", "6304698747", "0792838041", "B00008AOTR", "B000ELL1R6", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B000E5N63Y", "B000YBKO6U", "B00BY0EBK0", "6305558167", "B002O3Z50Q", "B00005PJ8K", "B006TTC5HC", "B0007TKNM4", "B00AEFY4IA", "6304765258", "B00AEBB86A", "B000DZIGDU", "B000FVQLRA", "B00AEFY5B6", "6305692688", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AMSLDTM", "B0000TANUI", "B00JA3RVG4", "B004SIP6QI", "B000O599YO", "B000MZHW40", "B00004XPPC", "0792838408", "B007HCI42A", "B0009RCPUC", "B00005B6JZ", "B0002YLCG0", "B00CZB9BE8", "B002O3Z510", "B00005OSJQ", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005QAQI", "B000CNESN0", "B00008AOTO", "B005DKS1TE", "B00DL48BM6", "0792841662", "B0001NBMH6", "B0001FGC1U", "6304711891"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFXRRO", "B00AEBBA36"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFXRRO", "B00AEBBA36", "B00HEPE6MM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22765}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.69, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B00003CXRA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510oEAHvU8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Enemy at the Gates"}

{"description": "Along withFantasiaandFantasia 2000, the  anthology set contains a third disc that examines a segment of both  movies in detail. Each segment has an introduction that has experts  (including Leonard Maltin), producer Roy E. Disney, or the animators  setting up the piece's history. Notes on the music and dozens of design  photos are included on all the segments, although others offer more  intriguing features. Abandoned animation is shown on many segments, as  are a few behind-the-scenes shorts; the most intriguing are experts  from Walt Disney's hosted documentaries on how his company made movies.  As for the photos, they are awkwardly catalogued and only the most  patient of viewers would want to look at all of them. In some segments,  though, these images are entertainingly produced as a \"story reel,\"  presenting these images--rough animation, sketches, pastel  paintings--with the musical accompaniment. For those looking for a more  well-rounded view of the films, the two one-hour documentaries on each film's disc lay the groundwork, but none of the anthology looks at how  the first film was seen through the years or gives time to anyone who  wasn't gung-ho about every element of the films. There is hardly a  mention of embarrassing stereotypes that were matted (and still are)  out of the \"Pastoral\" segment, or the intriguing aspect of the film as  a '60s icon for the ultimate head-trip. Disney does let their guard  down to show sequences that were being readied in 1940 for future  editions (including a recently restored short scored to \"Clair de  Lune\"). Most tantalizing is a look at how the special effects were done  in the original film. The guide is a scrapbook that one of the  technicians kept and was discovered only in 1990. Fans can only hope a  reproduction will be made available someday.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00KBES386", "B00004R99B", "B00004R99H", "B00004R99D", "0486287858", "B0040QTNSU", "B0040JHNAW", "B001ILFUDC", "B0012RLXBU", "0810980789", "0486462145", "B00006II6O", "B002A00J0O", "B0034GK74G", "B00008EY6W", "B00004U9WQ", "B0000BWVAI", "B00003CXCQ", "1579121489", "B00004R99S", "B000001M4K", "B00838HSYM", "B000YERP2S", "B004C03TJ8", "B000B8QG4A", "B0000BWVAF", "B000AAF1TU", "B0002YLCOM", "B006ML50SS", "B003H9M1Q2", "B00004R99Y", "B000063UR0", "B000GW8U1I", "B00447L4JG", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B0084IHVGG", "B003ZHVJGO", "B00335EQ0E", "B000FFJYA2", "B0001I561E", "B000BMGEIE", "B00005RDST", "B004PXNXB6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0040QTNSU", "B00003CX9W", "B00003CWPX", "B00004R99B"]}, "price": 44.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 89574}, "asin": "B00004Y7S5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JDY453ZBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Fantasia Anthology (3-Disc Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "If you've seenScreamandI Know What You Did Last Summer, then you know the entire plot ofScary Movie. That's okay, though, because this is a parody, and it helps to know the story in order to be able to get the jokes. No, the biggest surprise here is not the  story as much as the amount of full-frontal male nudity. Really, in addition to all the dick jokes (and the ass jokes and fart jokes), there's a couple of shots of the male member, one of which is erect and used as a weapon.Scary Moviesomehow ended up with an R rating, which in a sense is groundbreaking; perhaps our ratings board is loosening up after all.But is it funny? That's the most important question, and the answer to that is yes. In the vein ofAirplane!, with a dash of the Farrelly brothers,Scary Moviekeeps throwing jokes at you one after another. The law of averages says some of them have to hit, and enough of them do to keep the movie entertaining. Unlike the makers ofAirplane!, however, the Wayans brothers aren't making this movie out of a love of the genre, and unlike the Farrelly brothers, they don't make fun of retarded people with any sort of respect, so the humor throughout feels a lot uglier. Still, there are enough funny scenes inScary Movieto make the viewing experience worthwhile. Special credit must go to Lochlyn Munro as Greg, the over-the-top jock, who steals the movie up until the time he's gotta die.--Andy Spletzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SIP9I8", "B004SIP9KQ", "B000FOQ1KY", "B00CAATSME", "B0009P42WI", "B001J710YI", "B004SIP9O2", "B00AZMFINM", "B004SIP9MY", "B0016MJ6J2", "B004SIP9P6", "B000F9RLL2", "B004LWZW2O", "B005CFBYW6", "B004P7CMZ0", "6305017115", "B005DCJ218", "B0000VCZMK", "B00177YA06", "0780631684", "B000055WFZ", "B00008K7AM", "B002IT5GDC", "B000O76ZOO", "B0002VYOVI", "B00AEFXQLQ", "B000RIWAVW", "B001NPD9LS", "B000069CF0", "B004SIP8ES", "B00441GYVA", "630529142X", "B000FA57UI", "B000AM4P9K", "B009XTF8KQ", "B002A5EBMQ", "0767811070", "B00AEFYPXY", "B00005LC4Q", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B000K405CY", "B000IFRT4W", "B0021L8UXA", "B003Q6D27S", "B000FC2HS6", "B00081912E", "B00003CY5Y", "0783235070", "B00AEFYYH6", "B00H0EN98E", "B004EPZ084", "B000FA57US", "B001P3SA9Y", "B0031U8OEK", "B00003CXPS", "B003PIUINS", "B000VKL6Z2", "B001L9EXUC", "B000WZEZGI", "B003UESJBU", "B005DEUEXQ", "B00003CXS7", "B00009PY4G", "B00BEIYGT8", "B002GHHHG0", "B006W4KVH0", "B000GBEWHK", "B00AJLHUA8", "B002ZG971U", "B000WGYMTC", "B00J5JSV3A", "B00005K3NR", "B000J4QW7W", "B001J9KJ4I", "B00003CXZ1", "B004EPZ06G", "B000V4UFZK", "B0006SSOHC", "B00001QGUM", "B000022TSW", "B00AEFYE08", "0767824954", "B000031WD9", "B00004STUL", "B00005JNZU", "B004SEUJO6", "B008R65XTC", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B00AEFY37C", "B002ZG97TW", "B00005N7Z1", "B004P7CN7W", "B00003CY6D", "B00E8RKHWW", "B00BEIYMZ6", "B008G33PIM", "B000P0J09M", "B00006FDCD", "B00AEFYQWO"], "bought_together": ["B004SIP9I8", "B004SIP9KQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FOQ1KY", "B004SIP9KQ", "B004SIP9I8", "B008MXMFVE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 150447}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.99, "brand": "Dimension", "asin": "B00004Z4WQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5123WET5P4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Scary Movie"}
{"description": "While more cautious fans may want to pick and choose among the previously released individual volumes ofMonty Pythonfor their collection, true Pythonites will want to own this definitive, 14-volume DVD-only boxed set that contains all 45 episodes (in chronological order) ofMonty Python's Flying Circus. This \"persistently silly\" collection encompasses three-and-a-half seasons of dead parrots, cross-dressing lumberjacks, loonies, upper class twits, and spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, baked beans, spam, spam, and spam. Click past the occasional clunker and go directly to such signature sketches as the Ministry of Silly Walks, the Spanish Inquisition, the Fish-Slapping Dance, the Dead Parrot Sketch, the Lumberjack Song, the Cheese Shop, the Argument Clinic, and Nudge, Nudge. Taken as a whole, one marvels at how Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin, and Terry Gilliam thoroughly subverted television convention with \"something completely different,\" like sketches with no punch lines (\"Your average TV viewer isn't going to understand this\").A warning to the uninitiated: there is much \"material that some may find offensive, but which is really smashing.\" Violations of something called the \"Strange Sketch Act\" are the least of the troupe's offenses, as witness the Oscar Wilde Sketch, the Dirty Vicar Sketch, and the Most Awful Family in Britain Sketch, all of which achieve \"the really gross awfulness\" all Python fans are looking for.

{"description": "With its modest special effects, lean plot, and small cast of lesser  stars, this 1951 thriller remains a sturdy blueprint for fusing horror and  science fiction. The formula has been employed countless times since, fleshed  out with more extensive and elaborate production values, and manned by higher profiled marquee names, but the results have yet to improve onThe Thing from Another World, Howard Hawks's lone foray into sci-fi.The story begins as military airmen are dispatched to a remote Arctic research station where scientists have detected the crash of a spacecraft.  An effort to retrieve the saucer-shaped vehicle fails, but the team returns to the station with the frozen body of its sole occupant. When the extraterrestrial pilot is accidentally thawed, the crew, headed by a tough-talking pilot (Kenneth Tobey), grapples with a massive, chlorophyll-based humanoid (James Arness) thirsty for blood and in no mood for galactic diplomacy.Hawks takes only a production credit for this low-budget exercise, but his filmmaking style transcends Christian Nyby's nominal direction: rapid-fire, overlapping dialogue, an ensemble of comrades whose professionalism is tempered by wisecracks, and unsentimental female characters (embodied by feisty romantic interest Margaret Sheridan) recall Hawks's signature works, while propelling the plot over any potential gaps in credibility. It's hardly surprising, then, thatThe Thing from Another Worldremains among the most influential science fiction movies ever shot, or that it remains exciting entertainment a half century later.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKFR", "0783240953", "6303257801", "6302120101", "B00007JME0", "B000AQKU72", "B000DZC5PA", "B007Y1NNAW", "6300183084", "B00005R1O7", "6302890721", "0790731975", "6304507348", "0792835077", "6301977742", "0783236352", "6301977149", "6301968948", "6300208508", "B0000068SI", "B000JTATHG", "6301661729", "6304429274", "6300247589", "0790752395", "6302526191", "B000HDNPM0", "6303398375", "630442972X", "6303953492", "6302763835", "6301976401", "0783103107", "6300215539", "6302843200", "630168740X", "6300213900", "6300216500", "6300181278", "6302841798", "6300213838", "6302182530", "6300269477", "6300185281", "6300247597", "6301562178", "0790736055", "6300182533", "6300181340", "B00004R67T", "630258793X", "6303082815"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKFR", "B007Y1NNAW"], "also_viewed": ["B0067QPVJ6", "6300182878", "B000FOPPEC", "6303506291", "B00005JKFR", "6300247171", "B0045HCJKS", "B00AEBB8VK", "B00IYJFB2G"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 345640}, "asin": "B00005JG70", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5120YBRYW7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Thing From Another World [VHS]"}

The title character--who first appeared onThe Chris Rock Show--speaks a kind of slang on steroids, an incomprehensible stream of nonsense syllables that nonetheless makes him irresistible to women and a threat to evildoers everywhere. Pootie is part movie star, part superhero, righting wrongs with the slap of his daddy's belt. But when an evil corporation uses a super-ho named Ireenie (Jennifer Coolidge fromBest in ShowandLegally Blonde) to steal this magic belt, Pootie must find himself again. In the title role, Lance Crouther glides through the movie like Isaac Hayes's skinny younger brother, while Chris Rock lends his trademark bark to multiple roles, including Pootie's father. Crazed editing and a great soundtrack givePootie Tanga little extra oomph. A bizarre comedy, likely to develop a cult following.

Burnett is soon alone, trying to outrun a pursuing army, while commanding officer Reigert (Gene Hackman) finds his rescue operation hamstrung by politics, forcing Burnett to run far out of his way.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000095WW8", "B000G6BL60", "B00AEFXVCU", "B00003CXHJ", "B000065U1N", "B00AEBB86U", "B00AEBBA36", "B00004ZBVG", "B001KMB6XM", "6304765258", "B00003CXGV", "B00001ZWUS", "B00005JK8K", "B000N3SRO0", "6305428115", "B00AEBB86A", "B00003CXTG", "B00AEFYENK", "B001NY4WYC", "B00005PJ8T", "0767817745", "B00005JKBC", "B00BTYNXL4", "B0015D20FE", "B00005JA9F", "1558908315", "B00015YVDG", "B004U7MQWY", "B001LMAK9M", "B003ASLJIQ", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B002OGMGV4", "B002AT8K9W", "B000MZHW40", "B002AS464Q", "B00AEFY5B6", "B000P0J09C", "6304806434", "079284646X", "B00004XPPG", "B005LAIGYQ", "B00HEPE6MM", "0783240295", "6304711891", "B0015XHP2C", "B00008K76U", "B00008G8M4", "B0002V7OI8", "B0001NBMH6", "B00275EGWY", "B0007TKNGA", "B00005UQ9T", "B002IFUCZ8", "B0012KJ0DK", "B000WMA6R8", "B00005B6JZ", "B00005JKTP", "B008JFUNKU", "B00000G3PA", "B0000542CK", "B0045HCJFS", "B00AEFXRRO", "B0006GANOQ", "B000FFL2G6", "0792839730", "B0002O7XTU", "B000QUCRB4", "B00009L1TA", "0790736411", "B00005BCKF", "B00008OE4W", "B000OT6V0K", "B000KLQUSU", "B00I4X8KXY", "B00004STDN", "B00AEFXYJA", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B0045HCJG2", "B003ASLJOU", "B002NZK5R8", "B002NZK5UU", "B0002WZTOI", "6304883773", "0783226888", "B000P0J0EW", "B000CEV3M8", "B00008K76W", "B00003CXJ1", "B00A2H9P98", "B0000B1OFL", "B0004Z33EG", "B000RW3VCK", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000056VP4", "B0045HCJGC", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B0004Z33G4", "0792159659", "B00005JLQN"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFXVCU", "B00AEBBA36", "B00HEPE6MM"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 137715}, "asin": "B00005JKL8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J7E5RVJDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Behind Enemy Lines"}

{"description": "Keanu Reeves stars in this story that might best be described asBad News Bearsin the projects. Conor O'Neill (Reeves) is a charming ne'er-do-well with a disturbing gambling addiction. His penchant for betting on the wrong teams leaves him owing several thousand dollars to very violent people, and he ends up coaching a children's baseball team to pay off his debt. The movie skimps a bit on process: the kids start out as terrible players and become better but we don't see how; Conor starts caring but we don't see why. As by-the-numbers movies go, though, it isn't a bad one. The young actors in the cast are talented and understated. Most of the kids' characters are only barely fleshed out by the script, but this keeps the movie from being hijacked by extra-cute mugging. Parents should be cautioned--this movie has some very violent scenes that will frighten young children, and swearing is depicted as precocious and adorable. Still, like a baseball game, it isn't a bad way to spend your time.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000KHYN9C", "B00004Y2R1", "B00AMEZDJW", "B00000JGHV", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B002O3Z4XY", "B00AEFXOKO", "B0000633U2", "6305505780", "B00005JPK8", "B004GJYROG", "B0012YYZDG", "B00009AOAX", "078324021X", "B00003CY51", "B00AEFYE08", "B002GIBVWA", "B00005M20J", "B00E1HIWU8", "B0006J28MI", "B005SQRYEG", "B001DJLD12", "B0007LLPXI", "630514415X", "B000068NNU", "B0000JBUHI", "B003VE9WTW", "B00AEFXHNI", "B00DW5IKW0", "B000089771", "B000BITV9W", "1558908390", "B0001MMGC2", "B000089778", "B0010YSD90", "B000056VP4", "B00066FAQW", "B00005A3KS", "B00E1HIX66", "B00005JLG1", "B00005JLRZ", "B00028HBES", "6304821832", "0788815466", "B000FS9ULC", "B00AEFXSLE", "B000069I0E", "B001BP4K22", "0783230338", "B002GSXKOM", "B0010YSD8Q", "B00ANDDBBY", "B00DNF1SSC", "B000069I1K", "630592273X", "B0006GAI5U", "B000PE0GRI", "B000EXZFCQ", "B00006SFL7", "B0060ZJ7BC", "B00006LPH6", "B004GJYRF0", "B002VWNICM", "B004499NII", "B00AEFXGWK", "B000063RQO", "B00007BK2S", "B000053VAX", "6305428271", "B000G0O5I2", "B00008979O", "B0009A40NO", "B00005NRO0", "B00DQCSWUE", "B000WD3XKO", "6305065551", "0783230524", "B004WJT5E2", "B000XSWVEC", "B0000YEE6M", "B002CA68N4", "B000MNOX9E", "B009NNM9OA", "B000089773", "B000J10F14", "B00AEBB9UU", "B0006GANOQ", "B00AEFYKWU", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00007LP8J", "B00AEFY17E", "B002NZK5U0", "B0009K7RMA", "B00595W4CI", "B00L4K3MLE", "B000HDZKLO", "B000BOH8X2", "B000FUTVLY", "B00003W8NT", "0783237367"], "bought_together": ["B00AMEZDJW", "B00004Y2R1"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AMEZDJW", "B002O3Z4XY", "B00DNF1SSC", "B005SQRYEG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10614}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.81, "brand": "Team Marketing", "asin": "B00005JKE4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R4A6RG4XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hardball"}

Also included are storyboard comparisons and another glimpse of one of Shyamalan's early home movies.Signsis the first of the Vista Series to be a single disc and the extras seem light, but there are only a couple of quibbles: the director again does not provide a commentary track and there is no DTS soundtrack.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004BZIY", "B00064LJVE", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00003CXQA", "B000JLTR8Q", "B004SIP92O", "B00AEFYYH6", "B003102JDC", "B00005JNTI", "B00000G3PA", "B002GHHHKQ", "B003Y5H4SO", "B0002DB54A", "B00008G8M4", "B00AEBBA2W", "B0000648X0", "630471193X", "B002O3Z50G", "B00011CZRE", "B000PHVZNE", "B0087ZG7HK", "B002NZK5SM", "B00004XPPG", "B00005JOC9", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B0021L8UXA", "0783225733", "B0006L0LOS", "B0006SGYL0", "B000NOKFHQ", "B005LAIHXQ", "0800177029", "6305767866", "B00004TS0G", "6304711891", "B00AEFY3MC", "B002GIBVVG", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000U1ZV8K", "B00005JNY3", "B00070FX5U", "B00AEBB8NI", "B0002KVUKM", "B00008G8LY", "B000F6IOAM", "B00005JN0T", "B00AEBBA36", "B002LMV7R0", "B002NZK5UU", "B0013FDM7E", "B002O3Z4WK", "B0068FZ0GK", "B00015YVDG", "B000LC55F2", "B00001ZWUS", "B002GHHHL0", "B000BTJDGC", "B000EHRVOW", "B0087ZG7J8", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00005JN2Z", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEFXSLE", "B00019073K", "B00005LC4D", "B00005JL78", "B00IBKXSKA", "B004EPYZPS", "B00000JDIQ", "B00AEBB9WI", "B000RIWAVW", "0780618548", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00005JN0W", "B00AEFXNLY", "6305428115", "0767811100", "0800141601", "B00AEFXT1S", "0780631536", "B00000IQC4", "B004P7CNUY", "B001GCUO02", "B002AS464Q", "B00003CWS3", "B00006FDCD", "B000FS9FCG", "B00005JKZH", "B000067FP8", "B000K7VHQE", "B00BEIYG98", "B00005JNNT", "B000068NNU", "B000XT1P4S", "B0087ZG7PW", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B002I9Z8BM", "B00AEFXKUI", "B0010X73ZG", "B00003CXIP"], "bought_together": ["B00004BZIY", "B004SIP92O"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004BZIY", "B00386EZUY", "B000QUU4M8", "B0000VCZK2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 11300}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.99, "brand": "Touchstone Video", "asin": "B00005JL3T", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51c02AOAyCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Signs"}

{"description": "The plethora of extras on this two-disc set are worth your time. There are several well-produced segments on the physical aspects of the film highlighted by a tour of the vast Cinecitt&#xE0; Studio sets with director Martin Scorsese and production designer Dante Ferretti (with a 360-degree-view feature to boot). Historian Luc Sante introduces you to the Five Corners area in New York circa the mid-19th century, and there's a vintage vocabulary guide (from the 1859 edition ofThe Rogue's Lexicon). Even though it was made as a \"puff piece\" for the movie, the Discovery Channel show \"Uncovering the Real Gangs of New York\" is an informative half-hour on the film's historical background. There's another espresso double-shot from a Scorsese commentary track. Not recorded traditionally as he watches the movie, the track pieces together thoughts from the director including some recorded in an NPR interview. This allows Scorsese to be even more focused, dealing with the history of the time and his own 30-year struggle to make the film. One serious demerit for stretching the feature film over both discs, which most likely had to be done with having both Dolby 5.1 and DTS tracks along with the commentary on the long film.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000M341QE", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00080ZG10", "B00AEBB8NI", "B006OFN0SE", "B00005JLSB", "B000C20VPA", "B000MZHW40", "B001N44BVQ", "B002ZG980U", "B000P0J09M", "B00049QQHI", "B004SIP8ZM", "0767830555", "6305313687", "B0006GAOJA", "B00008975Z", "B0016Q2D66", "B0000DI87S", "B00008DP4C", "B00011CZRE", "B000P0J0EW", "B00004XPPB", "B008R65XYC", "B005LAIIJY", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000C20VRS", "B004SIP95G", "B000286RP2", "B002CPMB9O", "B002T9H2LA", "0307388980", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000A7DVR2", "B00AEFXKUI", "B008MILL8W", "B00AEBB9F0", "B001EZE5DI", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004FQX5B6", "B002QEHPQU", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00H9KKGTO", "B004SIP6GI", "B002VWNIEA", "B0001FGBUW", "B000A2UBN4", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00003CWM3", "B008D1Q1VA", "B00005V9HH", "B003ASLJQI", "B003ASLJQS", "B007SPPANM", "B000093FLA", "B00003CXZ4", "B00004XPPG", "B00001ZWUS", "B000H5TH20", "B000FKO5QK", "B002ZG99N6", "6304711905", "B0018CMJSU", "0767817710", "B009AMANBA", "079284646X", "B000FS9FCG", "B000065U1N", "B00AEBB89W", "B000P0J0AG", "B004SIP6QI", "B001QTXM5Y", "B004499LWG", "0783227906", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000J4P9P8", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00AEBB95K", "B000NOKFHQ", "B002VWNICC", "B00009W5CA", "B004U7MR14", "B004AOECXI", "B00003CXRM", "0783231202", "B000069HZP", "0783229526", "B001JIE7JC", "B00005221M", "B000N6TX1I", "B00005JMJG", "B000N3SRO0", "B00003CXWV", "B00005JMYI", "B003HKN52U", "0790732238", "B00004U103", "B003UESJHO", "B000P0J09C"], "bought_together": ["B000M341QE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002ZG980U", "B000P0J09M", "B0013FXWU6", "B00H9KKGTO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 46244}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.89, "brand": "Miramax", "asin": "B00005JKN9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516W0haa4aL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gangs of New York (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}

{"description": "Such a simple idea--yet so fiendishly complex in the execution.24, as surely everyone knows by now, is a thriller that takes places over 24 hours, midnight to midnight, in 24 one-hour episodes (well, 45-minute episodes if you subtract the commercials). Everything takes place in real time, which means no flashbacks, no flash-forwards, no handy time-dissolves. Every strand of the plot has to be dovetailed and interlocked so things happen just when they should, in the right amount of time. Not that easy.Creator Robert Cochran and his team of writers and directors have done an impressive job of putting the jigsaw together and keeping the tension ratcheted up high, as federal agent Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) runs around L.A. trying to stall an assassination attempt on an African American presidential candidate and rescue his wife and daughter from the clutches of the Balkan baddies. Twists, turns, revelations, and cliffhangers are tossed at us with satisfying regularity. It's not perfect: we get some hokey plot devices (instant amnesia, anybody?); the final twist makes no sense whatsoever; there are altogether too many huggy family moments; and as for Dennis Hopper's \"Serbian\" accent....Even so, this is undeniably mold-breaking TV. Sutherland, rescuing his career from the doldrums in one heroic leap, fully deserves his Golden Globe. Sets and locations are artfully deployed, and Sean Callery's score is a powerful, brooding presence. LikeMurder OneandThe Sopranos,24is one of those series that future TV thrillers will be measured against.--Philip Kemp", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008YGRU", "B0002XVQSU", "B000B837XI", "B000ICLRKC", "B000MR8W92", "B001L5SRJE", "B002ZCY7SW", "B000NDEXKW", "B001DMVZOE", "B002ZCY7TG", "B0015QWZ8S", "B0001WHXM0", "B001QE99AQ", "B009LDD1H6", "B000VWC9YW", "B001DJLCRC", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B0075FF5QM", "B000RO6JY0", "B001934SNM", "B0015RRNMA", "B00005JOC9", "B000R9YLKY", "B003145HQY", "B00005JNOG", "B00J5LXT44", "B00KPP6R9S", "B0053O8AKU", "B000Q6GUW0", "B000YABIQ6", "B0044E9JU0", "B00HW3EXCE", "B009MF5BXK", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00BW4S8AC", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B00JL6L4UY", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B00HX0KIAM", "B008CLI4N4", "B000W91RUG", "0553397737", "B00KDK64DY", "B00AIBZMM2"], "bought_together": ["B00008YGRU", "B0002XVQSU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0044E9JU0", "B00008YGRU", "B0002XVQSU", "B00LDCGBNE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18292}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.38, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B00005JLF2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41PB6M8MGRL._SX300_.jpg", "title": "24: Season 1"}

{"description": "Disney changes how they have been delivering their recent theatrical hits and improves the DVD experience. Gone is the creators' commentary track; instead there's a robust 45-minute feature on the making of the film that opens up the audience to older kids interested in the craft. The commentary track is for laughs with the MacKenzie Brothers-influenced moose Rutt & Tuke (SCTValumnus Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas) having a good old time; it's a treat for adults as kids. Also, the traditional still gallery has been replaced by a deft 10-minute display of the various artwork, narrated by the artists. All the deleted scenes are voiced and in various forms of animation; additionally there is a Phil Collins song that was not used in the film. Disney reaches into Pixar's bag of tricks with \"outtakes\" that kids will love, along with the two above-average set-top games. Connoisseurs should appreciate the options: both 2.35 and 1.77 widescreen formats are offered as well as 5.1 Dolby and DTS sound.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FQISFS", "B00029LO0Y", "B00005RDSQ", "B00005JLR2", "B000AAF1TU", "B001O5LVPI", "B001ILFUD2", "B00005TN8K", "B000DWMYQ8", "B0084IHVUC", "B000AAF1U4", "B0084IHVGG", "B003E66Y3E", "B0034GK74G", "B00003CXG7", "B00CTNYLQA", "B004ZBACOE", "B00AO686JC", "B000G75AZC", "B0000AOX0O", "B000L22SG6", "B00007LVCM", "B0084IHVN4", "B00004R99S", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B0007PIDBQ", "B000089G5O", "B000GW8U1I", "B000ROAK2W", "B000B8QG4A", "B000056H26", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B003H9M1Q2", "B003RACGZM", "B0002YLCOM", "B000YERP2S", "B00CUDD0C0", "B0000E32WJ", "B00CQRN3QI", "B0007KTBIU", "B000B8QG3G", "B0000VV4W2", "B000BITUVG", "B0001I561E", "B000HWZ4Q6", "B00024I2Z4", "B00009YXAW", "B00003CXB4", "B001FAFO3W", "B00EV1YZ96", "B0007Z9R0M", "B0006JMLRK", "B003E66Y84", "B000063V8M", "B0000524D0", "B001OMU6UM", "B00003CXCQ", "B001ILFUDC", "B000VBJEEG", "B00006LPHB", "B0034JKZ86", "B00005T7H3", "B003ZHVJGO", "B00004R99F", "B000050MN3", "B000096IAI", "B00000JGOQ", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00005T7H7", "B0013ND30M", "B00335EQ0E", "B0001I55VA", "B008YWY0HK", "6305161887", "B000H7JCK0", "B000F48D5U", "B00AFEX83C", "B004G600A4", "B00004R99Y", "B0012EM5D8", "B00004R99H", "B001FTIJS0", "B004A8ZX0K", "B0006UEVT0", "B004HO6I4M", "B000B8QFYG", "B00CHVJODE", "B007MDB6L0", "B00E9ZATJO", "B000035Z48", "B0024NSFYY", "B00005JNQS", "B0052OPJ1E", "B002ZG97YM", "B001NCDFTW", "B0001I55W4", "B0039N74CW", "B0000764FF", "B000LRJD64", "B00005JNS0"], "bought_together": ["B000FQISFS", "B000AAF1TU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00CTNYLQA", "B000OLGCI4", "B00CWM58WY", "B001O5LVPI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6077}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.96, "brand": "Disney", "asin": "B00005JMFH", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61LoOHu0mzL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Brother Bear (Two-Disc Special Edition)"}

{"description": "In the tradition of THE PRINCESS DIARIES, Disney's FREAKY FRIDAY is the extremely funny and heartwarming comedy everyone will love. Dr. Tess Coleman (the hilarious Jamie Lee Curtis) and her teenage daughter Anna (rockin' Lindsay Lohan) have one thing in common -- they don't relate to each other on anything. Not clothes or men or Anna's passion to be in a rock band. Nothing. Then one night a little mystic mayhem changes their lives and they wake up to the biggest freak-out ever.

{"description": "More sex. More violence. That's what you get in the unrated director's cut ofTaking Lives, which ought to tell you where director D.J. Caruso's priorities lie. The hot scenes between Angelina Jolie and Ethan Hawke are extended (offering a bit more nudity for Jolie's lecherous fans), and the fate of Gena Rowlands's character isconsiderablymore graphic, but none of the added footage makes the movie any better or worse. That said, this cynical director's cut is the only version worth buying if you're looking to fill out your serial-killer-thriller collection (or your movies-in-which-Jolie-gets-naked collection), and you might as well enjoy the gag reel outtakes because they contain the only footage on the entire DVD in which Jolie cracks a genuine smile. The four featurettes are really just one standard-issue promo reel chopped into thematic categories with a pretentiousCSIvibe, and while they offer little of substance, seasoned film buffs will welcome the appearance of veteran British editor Anne V. Coates, who briefly explains her approach to cutting high-tension scenes. The rest is routine at best, but given the choice between the full-screen DVD and this steamier, more gruesome widescreen version, well, it's no contest. Jolie and her breasts await you.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783240295", "B00005V4XV", "B0002KPIQY", "B00006G8JD", "B001GKJ2E8", "B0021L8V0M", "B000G2YCVA", "B001NFNFNU", "B000VBB6F6", "B00BTYU3W6", "B00029RT9E", "B00003CXZ1", "B002NZK5RI", "B004A8ZWSS", "B0050UEVNM", "B00003CWQR", "B000AP04FG", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B00AEFYGBA", "6305821216", "B000MXPE7O", "B00AEFYF2K", "B00011CZRE", "B0000ZG072", "B00096S49Y", "B00007AJE1", "B000PMFS2I", "0792159659", "B001HVZOB6", "B00004Z4WR", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00AEFXEGS", "B000MX7V70", "B000GRUMSC", "B00008L3S6", "B00151QYXU", "B0045HCIYA", "B000FS9UKI", "B006OB3JVQ", "B00005JN0T", "B0010YVCB6", "B00005JLZN", "6305308837", "B00003CY0V", "B00AEBBA2W", "B0034G4OSG", "B002NZK5VO", "B000E5N684", "B00015YVDG", "B0001GF2D8", "B0000541TM", "B0006IIPIK", "0790730979", "B00K2CHX9C", "B002QW7AMG", "B00AP2DC94", "B00023P4I8", "B001CC7PLM", "0767810872", "B00E8G5HXM", "B003LR5BD0", "B0062P3392", "B00BB67UNW", "B00BNH9NCU", "B0007W7I4W", "B0010HOZW6", "B003L20IG0", "0783229402", "B004XQO90O", "B00006RCNY", "B00006HAWN", "B00024JC30", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B0000V492Y", "B00174RCHW", "B0040J1RX6", "B0002IQLHQ", "B002AT8KAG", "B00005JN2Z", "B001N44BVQ", "B0047T74CM", "B00BEIYIF0", "B004A8ZX28", "B000U1ZV76", "B000G5SILC", "B000R4SMCW", "0767807588", "B00009WVSL", "B002DU39GW", "6301971345", "B004SIP7VM", "B000BVM1S2", "0767802519", "B00887490Y", "B004VJJG92", "B0067EKYAY", "B000BYY11Y", "B001JNNDJM", "B00005JKQS"], "bought_together": ["0783240295"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0021L8V0M", "B001GKJ2E8", "B000AP04FG", "B001NFNFNU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 54618}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.95, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JMWP", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513DTkJ5nnL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Taking Lives - Director's Cut (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Like a good dream, Sofia Coppola'sLost in Translationenvelops you with an aura of fantastic light, moody sound, head-turning love, and a feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, even though you've probably never been to this neon-fused version of Tokyo. Certainly Bob Harris has not. The 50-ish actor has signed on for big money shooting whiskey ads instead of doing something good for his career or his long-distance family. Jetlagged, helplessly lost with his Japanese-speaking director, and out of sync with the metropolis, Harris (Bill Murray, never better) befriends the married but lovelorn 25-year-old Charlotte (played with heaps of poise by 18-year-old Scarlett Johansson). Even before her photographer husband all but abandons her, she is adrift like Harris but in a total entrapment of youth. How Charlotte and Bill discover they are soul mates will be cherished for years to come. Written and directed by Coppola (The Virgin Suicides), the film is far more atmospheric than plot-driven: we whiz through Tokyo parties, karaoke bars, and odd nightlife, always ending up in the impossibly posh hotel where the two are staying. The wisps of bittersweet loneliness of Bill and Charlotte are handled smartly and romantically, but unlike modern studio films, this isn't a May-November fling film. Surely and steadily, the film ends on a much-talked-about grace note, which may burn some, yet awards film lovers who \"always had Paris\" with another cinematic destination of the heart.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305428239", "B0007UC8Y4", "B000BX8R10", "B00005JMJG", "B0000640VJ", "B0010X8NF0", "B003UESJLU", "B007L6VR12", "0767821408", "B00007AJF8", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00DW5IKYS", "B001QOGYBI", "B000M06KJ8", "B00005JLRE", "B00000G02H", "B0006TPE4C", "B0007TKOAA", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00DYVUBYM", "B00H9HZITU", "B000Z8GZYW", "B004SEUIXS", "B00AEFXN9G", "B003CRM6PA", "B00008RH3J", "B000EQHXNW", "B0001I1K32", "B0008JIJ2O", "B001DJ7PR8", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0009PVZD2", "B000CS464G", "B00337KM2S", "B003102JDM", "0790734796", "B001P3SA8K", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B0000WN0SC", "B00003CWTI", "B00003CXZ4", "B00008975Z", "B0057ZAA6W", "B000IU37SO", "B00004RJ73", "B00AEFXGIY", "B007P9HW3M", "B005MYEQ4U", "B000K7VHQE", "B00005JNC2", "B00079Z9VO", "B000063JDE", "B0001US61O", "B0000WN15O", "B00G7QPXUI", "B0041KKYEM", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00006LPGP", "B0006H32EI", "B00005JKJA", "B00AEFYCL4", "B000KX0IOK", "B002T9H2LA", "B001TOD92C", "B004XVMCKS", "B00AEBB9CS", "B008220DGE", "0767802519", "B000069HYF", "B007D5E7C2", "B000M7XRAG", "B004U7MR14", "B003O7I6SE", "B000A7DVR2", "B005LAIIJY", "B00A81MV3U", "B000055Y0X", "B00005V9HH", "B000E33VWW", "0783225903", "B00AEFXE9U", "B000N6TX1I", "B00CIOD6HK", "B0021L8UOY", "B004SIP95G", "B000PAAJZ6", "B002ZG980U", "B007UW9WOQ", "B00GKOJ98E", "B0014D5RBE", "B00011CZRE", "B001HN699A", "B000M4RG7E", "B003ELKNH2", "0767802535", "B00121QGPY", "B004FQX5B6", "6305609764", "B0009A40ES"], "bought_together": ["B0007UC8Y4", "6305428239"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00JAQJMJ0", "B007L6VR12", "B001QOGYBI", "B0010X8NF0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2901}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.77, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JMJ4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518vLN4%2B7KL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lost in Translation"}

{"description": "Like any DVD blockbuster from producer Jerry Bruckheimer, the extras are plentiful and often a bit too self-congratulatory (worst offender here is the primary commentary track). The slickly (natch) produced making-of documentary goes through the standard routine; however, the less-flashy \"fly on the wall\" bits--just showing what happens on set without comment--is more fun, offering effortless insight on the filmmaking process. The best treasure is a nifty interactive history on pirates with plenty of background material. You can simply play the filmed segments or take a tour around a ship to discover the material (and a few surprises). There's a lot of archival material on the theme-park ride that inspired the film and several odds and ends including an enjoyable chronicle of the vintage ship's voyage from its home harbor to the movie set. The kids should really dig the DVD-ROM \"Moonlight Becomes Ye,\" in which they can turn their own mug into a ghostly pirate. There's also a bounty of extended and deleted scenes (19 in all) and a very funny blooper reel. With both DTS and Dolby 5.1, sound systems will get a workout with the excellent (and loud) sound design.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000I0RQVI", "B000U7WV1Y", "B005COPWZW", "B004A8ZWUQ", "B00005JN5E", "B0013BM63O", "B006VRRGNK", "B00005JKZV", "B00005JPH2", "B0014Z4OMU", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00003CWT6", "B004DTLK80", "B00005JKZY", "B0000A1RJI", "B004M1A21K", "B004DTLK7G", "B00003CXZ1", "B001HN694K", "B001E75QH0", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00005JKCH", "B0087ZG7HK", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B000E6EK2Y", "B000E8M0VA", "B003UYUQZW", "B00AEFYGBA", "B000W746GK", "B00005JMQW", "B0083SBMBM", "B001DHXT20", "B0002234LS", "B000W7F5SS", "B002PMV9FG", "B0002KVUKM", "B004EPYZUS", "B0053FANRC", "B00BEZTMFY", "6304806434", "B000VR0570", "0783231644", "B001OQCV6A", "B000AYELVA", "B008JFUO72", "B005G4TJUC", "B00004R99S", "B00023B1LC", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00003CXI1", "B001HQZJMU", "B00000IRE6", "B0002ZDVEU", "B008QE9XD2", "B00F84H73Q", "B00E5I2MEK", "B003Y5H5EW", "B007K3JFUQ", "B003QO8TOQ", "B000NQRR1Q", "B000YPUF9W", "B001EZE5BU", "B004A8ZWSS", "B0009MDPYM", "B00LG6YEKE", "B002ZG980U", "B002ZG994U", "B000U1ZV8K", "B001DZ8TRW", "B00005JLR2", "B000VWYJ86", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00000JQB5", "B004XKCZAG", "B000W796OM", "B001GCUO0W", "B00AQSN7HE", "B00000ILDH", "B0053FANT0", "B0000VAFO0", "B0002IQMAM", "B000HRMAPE", "B004LWZW7Y", "B008UZA8FY", "B0001HLVS2", "B00007AJGH", "B00005JNJV", "B003YAR97K", "B00CHVJODE", "B000UR9T8C", "B0049IHX2C", "B000G6BLW4", "B00177YA1K", "0783227345", "B0014Z4ON4", "B001TK80C0", "B002O5M4T4", "B00AEBBA72", "B00005JOC9"], "bought_together": ["B000I0RQVI", "B000U7WV1Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005COPWZW", "B000I0RQVI", "B0071JADFU", "B00005JPFX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6260}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.23, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JM5E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51fX40gGdXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "The Quiet Americanproves that elegant and intelligent filmmaking can be emotionally powerful. Michael Caine plays Thomas Fowler, a British journalist in 1950s Vietnam with a lovely Vietnamese mistress named Phuong  (Do Thi Hai Yen) and a jaded view of the political strife teeming around him. He befriends a seemingly innocuous American named Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser), who falls in love with Phuong--and slowly, Pyle's real purpose in  Vietnam becomes revealed. Fowler finds that, to hold on to the carefully balanced life he's created for himself, he must make choices he's long avoided. Caine and Fraser are both superb and give a human face to complicated politics; as a result,The Quiet Americanmanages to be  compelling as both history and a story about very specific people embroiled in a very personal conflict.

{"description": "Jamie Foxx's uncannily accurate performance isn't the only good thing aboutRay. Riding high on a wave of Oscar buzz, Foxx proved himself worthy of all the hype by portraying blind R&B; legend Ray Charles in a warts-and-all performance that Charles approved shortly before his death in June 2004. Despite a few dramatic embellishments of actual incidents (such as the suggestion that the accidental drowning of Charles's younger brother caused all the inner demons that Charles would battle into adulthood), the film does a remarkable job of summarizing Charles's strengths as a musical innovator and his weaknesses as a philandering heroin addict who recorded some of his best songs while flying high as a kite. Foxx seems to be channeling Charles himself, and as he did with the life of Ritchie Valens in La Bamba, director Taylor Hackford gets most of the period details absolutely right as he chronicles Ray's rise from \"chitlin circuit\" performer in the early '50s to his much-deserved elevation to legendary status as one of the all-time great musicians. Foxx expertly lip-syncs to Ray Charles' classic recordings, but you could swear he's the real deal in a film that honors Ray Charles without sanitizing his once-messy life.--Jeff ShannonMore on Ray CharlesModern Sounds in Country and Western Music(CD)The Genius of Ray Charles(CD)Ray Charles and Betty Carter--Dedicated to You(CD)Genius & Soul--The 50th Anniversary Collection(CD)Ray: A Tribute to the Movie, the Music, and the Man(book)More Albums by Ray Charles", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000E8QVWY", "B001P3SA94", "B00465I1CE", "B00005JKMQ", "6305428409", "B003BV8I3Q", "B00AEFXTKO", "B0002LE9HC", "B000BOH8X2", "B00AEFYG3S", "0790739313", "B000JJSL1W", "B000A50460", "B00005TQ44", "0783230524", "B0009R1TJ0", "0780627822", "B00AEFZ63M", "B000P0J092", "B002VWNICM", "B00EV4EUT8", "B000JLTRH2", "B000N6U0E2", "B0041QSZS8", "0783237367", "078324228X", "B00AEFY6TW", "B003HKN534", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00007AJG1", "B00007L4KF", "B00ANDDBBY", "B000BITV9W", "0783114907", "B00007AJG2", "1558908390", "B00005JLRZ", "B000FVQLQQ", "6305692572", "0767821637", "B002CA68NO", "B00AFEXRME", "B002CPMB9O", "B004SIP93S", "B000063JDI", "B00005NB8K", "B00125WAWS", "6305505780", "B000IFRT4W", "B001TUZGPO", "B009NNM9OA", "B000RB6XG2", "B000P0J0CY", "B0001FR3IQ", "B000FVQLRA", "B00066FAVW", "B002XMGGK6", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00DW5IL2E", "B00005JPK8", "0767811070", "B000I0QL7I", "B000069I0E", "B00080ZG10", "0306814315", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00049QQHI", "B00000JGHV", "B0007CEXYK", "B0001Q4BOE", "B0000YEE6M", "B000NIVJF4", "B008Y1YJN6", "B00066VTU8", "B001132GNY", "B0006QAIG4", "B0034G4OSG", "B000C20VRS", "0800141741", "B00A2H9QN8", "B000Y11B8K", "B00005LB86", "B000056VP4", "B00005JL72", "B000095J01", "B000Q7ZNZ4", "B002CAWNEM", "B003UESJHO", "B00066FAQW", "0783230389", "B0013FDM7E", "B00007ELEO", "B00AMEZDJW", "B000P0J0CE", "B003Y5H4ZC", "0767821955", "B00003GPFT", "B0021L8V2A"], "bought_together": ["B000E8QVWY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002LE9HC", "B000E8QVWY", "B000BOH8X2", "B00AZMFJYA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17277}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.89, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JND5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41RQ8ETK19L._SX300_.jpg", "title": "Ray (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Batman Beginsdiscards the previous four films in the series and recasts the Caped Crusader as a fearsome avenging angel. That's good news, because the series, which had gotten off to a rousing start under Tim Burton, had gradually dissolved into self-parody by 1997'sBatman & Robin. As the title implies,Batman Beginstells the story anew, when Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) flees Western civilization following the murder of his parents. He is taken in by a mysterious instructor named Ducard (Liam Neeson in another mentor role) and urged to become a ninja in the League of Shadows, but he instead returns to his native Gotham City resolved to end the mob rule that is strangling it. But are there forces even more sinister at hand?Cowritten by the team of David S. Goyer (a veteran comic book writer) and director Christopher Nolan (Memento),Batman Beginsis a welcome return to the grim and gritty version of the Dark Knight, owing a great debt to the graphic novels that preceded it. It doesn't have the razzle dazzle, or the mass appeal, ofSpider-Man 2(though the Batmobile is cool), and retelling the origin means it starts slowly, like most \"first\" superhero movies. But it's certainly the best Bat-film since Burton's original, and one of the best superhero movies of its time. Bale cuts a good figure as Batman, intense and dangerous but with some of the lightheartedness Michael Keaton brought to the character. Michael Caine provides much of the film's humor as the family butler, Alfred, and as the love interest, Katie Holmes (Dawson's Creek) is surprisingly believable in her first adult role. Also featuring Gary Oldman as the young police officer Jim Gordon, Morgan Freeman as a Q-like gadgets expert, and Cillian Murphy as the vile Jonathan Crane.--David HoriuchiBatmanat Amazon.comAllBatmanDVDsBatman Begins101: A Comic Book PrimerWhere Have I Seen Christian Bale?AllBatmanComics and Graphic NovelsBatmanToysBatman BeginsSoundtrackStills fromBatman Begins(click for larger images)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA", "B002GSXKN8", "B000P0J06U", "B001OST0LW", "B000P0J06K", "B004EPZ07K", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00005JKCH", "B001GCUO1Q", "B002ZG980U", "B001OST0M6", "B008JFUPFI", "B004LWZWFQ", "B00005JMQW", "B004LWZW42", "B000VI70QS", "B001DHXT20", "B000M341QE", "B0000959N0", "B000UR9T8C", "B00005JNTU", "B000AYELVA", "B00E5I2M6I", "B002IPFWTE", "B000HEVZ9E", "B0090SI56Y", "B002HWRYJE", "B0006L0LOS", "B000OVLBF8", "B00003CWT6", "B000VR0570", "B00E5I2MEK", "B000HCO83Q", "B0007P0Y7C", "B008JFUO72", "B00F4FFO8E", "B001CDR1FG", "B000P0J0EW", "B002T9H2LA", "B0002KVUKM", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00005N5S5", "B0083SBMBM", "B0001BKAEY", "B00AQSN7HE", "B000J10EQU", "B00005JKZY", "B002NXSRVG", "B000AYELVU", "B001OQCV6A", "B004LWZW4M", "B001VLBDD0", "B001GZ6QEC", "B004GJYRA0", "B007REV4T8", "B001TK80C0", "B000HRJLII", "B001QTXM5Y", "B005G4TJUC", "B00005JKZV", "B0053FANT0", "B00005JA8B", "B003YAR97K", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00001ZWUS", "B004EPYZQC", "B001N44BVQ", "B006VRRGNK", "B001AEF6HM", "B00000JQB5", "B00011CZRE", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00AEFY0F2", "B007K3JFUQ", "B0002IQMAM", "B00005JN0T", "B002SJIO4A", "B000VWYJ86", "B0013FDM7E", "B00005JNTI", "B00407PNY2", "B00DTPRZ24", "B008JFUS0U", "B00004Z4WR", "B000FS9FCG", "B000QXDED6", "B0085A9HU6", "0780624890", "B00005LOUK", "B000065U1N", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005JN5T", "B001QB9H1U", "B00005JMUA", "0792844890", "B0007DFJ0G", "B004EPYZSK", "B008JFUOWM", "B00AEFY5B6"], "bought_together": ["B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009JBWOU0", "B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA", "B002ZG980U"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7806}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.99, "brand": "DC Comics", "asin": "B00005JNJV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518zjc4XtzL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Batman Begins (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}

Instead of a mad slasher, however, Spielberg (along with writers Josh Friedman & David Koepp) utilizes aliens hell-bent on quickly destroying humanity, and the terrifying results that prey upon adult fears, especially in the post-9/11 world. The realistic results could be a new genre, the grim popcorn thriller; often you feel like you're watching Schindler's List more than Spielberg's other thrill-machine movies (Jaws,Jurassic Park). The film centers on Ray Ferrier, a divorced father (Tom Cruise, oh so comfortable) who witnesses one giant craft destroy his New Jersey town and soon is on the road with his teen son (Justin Chatwin) and preteen daughter (Dakota Fanning) in tow, trying to keep ahead of the invasion. The film is, of course, impeccably designed and produced by Spielberg's usual crew of A-class talent. The aliens are genuinely scary, even when the film--like the novel--spends a good chunk of time in a basement. Readers of the book (or viewers of the deft 1953 adaptation) will note the variation of whom and how the aliens come to Earth, which poses some logistical problems. The film opens and closes with narration from the novel read by Morgan Freeman, but Spielberg could have adapted Orson Welles's words from the famous Halloween Eve 1938 radio broadcast: \"We couldn't soap all your windows and steal all your garden gates by tomorrow night, so we did the best next thing: we annihilated the world.\"--Doug ThomasWar of the Worldsat Amazon.comThe SoundtrackThe War of the Worlds(1953)War of the Worlds - The Complete First Season(TV series)Classic Sci-Fi Movies and Their RemakesAliens Invade on DVDThe Prog-rock Opera (no kidding)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B00005JL78", "B001SGEUYW", "B00008G8M4", "B00005JL3T", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AEFXNLY", "B00005JMXX", "B001OQCV2E", "B000VECAD0", "B002O3Z510", "B0002V7OI8", "B000H30B2C", "B000EGDB10", "B00005JN2Z", "B005LAIIMG", "B005PTYP70", "B002O3Z50G", "B0002V7ON8", "B00005JN0T", "B00K2CHW48", "B002SJIO4A", "0783225547", "B008JFUO36", "B00005JKLZ", "B00AS1Q93S", "1936594056", "B004EPYZUS", "B001TUZG4K", "B00AEFXR1K", "B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFXYJA", "0767817478", "B0034G4ORC", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00070FX5U", "B0045HCJSA", "B00000G3PA", "B005LAIHPE", "B003Y5H5GK", "B00AEBBA72", "B00003CWU3", "B00I9TDMRM", "B001ECDVKE", "B00003CXXP", "B000V4UFZK", "B0010X73ZG", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00005JKFR", "B000XT1P4S", "B003HKN52U", "B0009PW4D2", "B000HRMAPE", "B004EPYZPS", "B0018QPPXW", "B0002WZTOI", "B00AEBB9LO", "B004LWZW4M", "B003ABZHAO", "B003YJFALS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B000OT6V64", "B004P7CN7W", "B000CCBC9O", "B00000ILDD", "0767803434", "B001L57ZYM", "B000065V3G", "B007STBUHI", "B002ZG980U", "B008JFUQZ2", "B00005B6JZ", "B0006GANOQ", "B000F1IQN2", "1494343576", "B001GCUO02", "B00004Y87O", "0783226810", "B004EPYZSK", "B000P0J0BU", "B005LAIHXQ", "B001680M26", "B000EQHXN2", "B0045HCJFS", "B00004BZIY", "B00008G8M5", "B00003CXQA", "B008JFUS0U", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00EIN6KJ0", "B0000DZ6N3", "B000MV8A9A", "B00005JKYX", "B0000YEEGM", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B0013FCWUW", "B002ZG9864", "B00003CWTI", "B008MIMWQW", "B00IKM5OCO"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBB8VK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B004LWZW4M", "B00005JL78", "B004EPYZSK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18739}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JNTI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51upxzPRnXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "War of the Worlds"}

{"description": "Marvel Comics' first family of superherodom, the Fantastic Four, hits the big screen in a light-hearted and funny adventure.  It begins when down-on-his-luck genius Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd,Horatio Hornblower) has to enlist the financial and intellectual help from former schoolmate and rival Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon,Nip/Tuck) in order to pursue outer-space research into human DNA.  Also on the trip are Reed's best friend, Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis,The Shield); his former lover, Sue Storm (Jessica Alba,Dark Angel,Sin City), who's now Doom's employee and love interest; and her hotshot-pilot brother, Johnny Storm (Chris Evans,Cellular).  Things don't go as planned, of course, and the quartet becomes blessed--or is it cursed?--with superhuman powers: flexibility, brute strength, invisibility and projecting force fields, and bursting into flame.  Meanwhile, Doom himself is undergoing a transformation.Among the many entries in the comic-book-movie frenzy,Fantastic Fouris refreshing because it doesn't take itself too seriously. Characterization isn't too deep, and the action is a bit sparse until the final reel (like most \"first\" superhero movies, it has to go through the \"how did we get these powers and what we will do with them\" churn). But it's a good-looking cast, and original comic-book cocreator Stan Lee makes his most significant Marvel-movie cameo yet, in a speaking role as the FF's steadfast postal carrier, Willie Lumpkin. Newcomers to superhero movies might find the idea of a family with flexibility, strength, invisibility, and force fields a retread ofThe Incredibles, but Pixar's animated film was very much a tribute to the FF and other heroes of the last 40 years. The irony is that whileFantastic Fouris an enjoyable B-grade movie, it's the tribute,The Incredibles, that turned out to be a film for the ages.--David HoriuchiOn the DVDThe principal extra on the DVD is a spirited commentary track by Jessica Alba, Michael Chiklis, and Ioan Gruffud.  Self-avowed FF fan Chiklis explains why the Thing doesn't have a craggy brow, Alba recalls which things were \"cool,\" and they talk about looking forward to the sequel. There are three short deleted scenes (including a goofy Wolverine reference), 20 minutes of barely watchable hand-held video footage from the press tour, music videos, and some short featurettes including an appearance by FF creator Stan Lee.--David HoriuchiThe Fantastic Four at Amazon.comComics and Graphic NovelsDisney animated seriesThe classic comic bookMovie tie-in graphic novelThe Xbox gameFantastic FourSoundtrackThe Fantastic CastJessica Albaas Sue StormMichael Chiklisas The ThingIoan Gruffuddas Reed RichardsChris Evansas Johnny StormStills fromFantastic Four(click for larger images)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000VI70QS", "B0000959N0", "B001DHXT20", "B0007P0Y7C", "B004EPZ07K", "B001CDR1FG", "B00E5I2MEK", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00E5I2MCM", "B000OVLBF8", "B00005JMQW", "B008JFUO72", "B004LWZW42", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000UR9T8C", "B0090SI56Y", "B000HEVZ9E", "B000HCO83Q", "B00005JKCH", "B005OY6LBE", "B001OQCVI8", "B008JFUS0U", "B004LWZWFQ", "B000AYELVU", "B0002IQMAM", "B003YAR97K", "B0083SBMBM", "B001QB9H1U", "B001AK3S4Y", "B005LAIGW8", "B000AYELVA", "B001F7MSFM", "B0006L0LOS", "B003H8F3AY", "B008JFUPFI", "B006DHAT5K", "B002GSXKN8", "B002ZG99G8", "B00005JNJV", "B002IPFWTE", "B002NXSRVG", "B000VR0570", "B0006D3HGA", "B004LWZWGA", "B005LAII44", "B000YV1Q2G", "B00F4FFO8E", "B005G4TJUC", "B00005JN0T", "B0007US7CQ", "B00E1HIXEI", "B000J10EQU", "B0002KVUKM", "B000VKL6T8", "B001TK80C0", "B002ZG99B8", "B000Y7U98C", "B002GSXKNI", "B00005JM5B", "B001GZ6QC4", "B000PFUAP0", "B00005JKWJ", "B0009P42WI", "B00174RCHW", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00005JKYX", "B005TK0MFE", "B000VNMMPW", "B001QTXM5Y", "B000EU1Q7M", "B00008G8M4", "B000P6XQ50", "B00005JN5E", "B0007V6ITE", "B001VLBDD0", "B005LAIH54", "B001FB55HQ", "B000IJ79WU", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B00561BNJK", "B001VLFE7G", "B000CNER1S", "B00K7IPFSM", "B001BP4K22", "B00005JL78", "B0001CNRS4", "B00979KQD6", "B00157OI9Q", "B004EPYZUS", "B002HWRYJE", "B009YQJ322", "B003Y5H5EW", "0780624890", "B001RHGRT8", "B0013J55B6", "B0013BM63O", "B0053FANPY", "B009MO57H6", "078401132X"], "bought_together": ["B000VI70QS", "B001DHXT20"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000VI28Z6", "B000VI70QS", "B008JFUS0U", "B0090SI56Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12162}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.98, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00005JNTU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AM4R5J04L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fantastic Four (Widescreen Edition)"}

There is only one behind-the-scenes feature, a 16-minute cursory but entertaining glance at director John Lasseter's influences (his dad was a car-parts manager), including some of the real-life inspiration for the film such as Michael Wallis's influential book on Route 66 (he also voiced the sheriff). There's a new cartoon for the DVD, \"Mater and Ghost Light,\" which is smile-inducing at best. Four deleted scenes (in storybook format with voices) also show a darker tone the movie may have taken at one point.

{"description": "Movies don't come any bigger than Peter Jackson'sKing Kong, a three-hour remake of the 1933 classic that marries breathtaking visual prowess with a surprising emotional depth. Expanding on the original story of the blonde beauty and the beast who falls for her, Jackson creates a movie spectacle that matches hisLord of the Ringsfilms and even at times evokes their fantasy world while celebrating the glory of '30s Hollywood. Naomi Watts stars as Ann Darrow, a vaudeville actress down on her luck in Depression-era New York until manic filmmaker Carl Denham (a game but miscast Jack Black) entices her with a lead role. Dazzled by the genius of screenwriter Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody), Ann boards the tramp steamer S.S.Venture, which she--and most of the wary crew--believes is headed for Singapore. Denham, however, is in search of the mythic Skull Island, hoping to capture its wonders on film and make a fortune. What he didn't count on were some scary natives who find that the comely Darrow looks like prime sacrifice material for a mysterious giant creature....There's no point in rehashing the entire plot, as every movie aficionado is more than familiar with the trajectory ofKing Kong; the challenge facing Jackson, his screenwriters, and the phenomenal visual-effects team was to breathe new life into an old, familiar story. To that degree, they achieve what could be best called a qualified success. Though they've assembled a crackerjack supporting cast, including Thomas Kretschmann as theVenture's hard-bitten captain and young Jamie Bell as a plucky crewman, the first third of the movie is rather labored, with too much minute detail given over to sumptuous re-creations of '30s New York and the unexciting initial leg of theVenture's sea voyage. However, once the film finds its way to Skull Island (which bears more than a passing resemblance toLOTR's Mordor),Kongturns into a dazzling movie triumph, by turns terrifying and awe-inspiring. The choreography and execution of the action set pieces--including one involving Kong and a trio of Tyrannosaurus Rexes, as well as another that could be charitably described as a bug-phobic's nightmare--is nothing short of landmark filmmaking, and a certain Mr. Spielberg should watch his back, asKongtrumps most anything that has come before it.Despite the visual challenges ofKing Kong, the movie's most difficult hurdle is the budding romance between Ann and her simian soulmate. Happily, this is where Jackson unqualifiedly triumphs, as this unorthodox love story is tenderly and humorously drawn, by turns sympathetic and wondrous. Watts, whose accessibility balances out her almost otherworldly loveliness, works wonders with mere glances, and Andy Serkis, who digitally embodies Kong here much as he did Gollum in theLOTRfilms, breathes vibrant life into the giant star of the film without ever overplaying any emotions. The final, tragic act of the film, set mostly atop the Empire State Building, is whereKongearns its place in movie history as a work that celebrates both the technical and emotional heights that film can reach.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"bought_together": ["B000EHQTZO", "B00AEFYEU8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EHQTZO", "B00AEFYEU8", "B0087ZG7HK", "0767817478"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 32487}, "categories": [["Movies & TV"]], "price": 8.94, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JO20", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513Y54TGdwL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "King Kong (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Unlike so many boxed-set tributes to actors, this one's actually got a tight, logical theme:Errol Flynn Adventuresoffers five World War II pictures made at Warner Bros. during Flynn's reign as a top leading man. Four of the films were directed by one of Flynn's favored collaborators, the robust Raoul Walsh, and all of them have an urgent wartime commitment that puts them in a zone between entertainment and propaganda.That zone is a compelling place, and often emotionally potent. The earliest (1942) of the films is also the lightest in tone: Walsh'sDesperate Journeyhas a joshing attitude that belies its title. Flynn plays the Aussie leader of a multinational bomber crew that crash-lands in Germany (where the Germans actually speak German) and must make its way across hostile territory to safety--a suspenseful setup that allows for some derring-do and wisecracking on the trip (although Flynn and Walsh are adept at shifting gears from comedy to heroism at a moment's notice). Ronald Reagan plays a flippant US flyboy and enjoys one of his best moments on screen with an engaging scene of double talk.Edge of Darkness, directed by Lewis Milestone, is an extraordinarily powerful 1943 film about a defiant band of resisters in a small seaside town in Nazi-occupied Norway. Serious and stirring, with messages aplenty about the importance of solidarity and sacrifice during wartime, the movie goes all the way and then some. Flynn tamps down his usual jocularity, folding himself into a remarkable ensemble (we're talking at least a dozen significant roles here) that includes Walter Huston, Ann Sheridan, Judith Anderson, and Ruth Gordon.By comparison,Northern Pursuitis tame, with Flynn in snowy Canada, escorting a Nazi (Helmut Dantine) to custody&hellip; or is he? The question mark is about the only interesting wrinkle in this far-fetched picture, although Flynn doesn't embarrass himself. Ah, but our man slips into fine form in 1944'sUncertain Glory, a crackerjack premise that allows Flynn to exude his more roguish charms. His character is a convicted killer scheduled for the guillotine, and he and his guardian (Paul Lukas) contemplate the possibility of the doomed man falsely turning himself in as a wanted saboteur; the Nazis are holding 100 locals hostage to slaughter if the real saboteur doesn't turn himself in, and after all, wouldn't a Nazi firing squad be preferable to the guillotine?Much larger in scope, and a demonstration of Walsh's talent for dynamic compositions and irresistible narrative flow, isObjective, Burma!, a tough battle epic in which the soldiers get realistically grimy. Flynn's platoon parachutes into Burma for a mission--but the real challenge is trekking back out again. Harrowing in both its suggestion of Japanese atrocities and its willingness to kill off characters you didn't expect to see die, this film must surely have been an influence onSaving Private Ryan.

{"description": "Literary adaptations just don't get any better than director Joe Wright's 2005 version of Jane Austen'sPride & Prejudice. The key word here isadaptation, because Wright and gifted screenwriter Deborah Moggach have taken liberties with Austen's classic novel that purists may find objectionable, but in this exquisite film their artistic decisions are entirely justified and exceptionally well executed. It's a more rural England that we see here, circa 1790 (as opposed to Austen's early 19th century), in which Elizabeth Bennet (Keira Knightley) is one of several sisters primed for marriage, with an anxious mother (Brenda Blethyn) only too desperate to see her daughters paired off with the finest, richest husbands available. Elizabeth is strong-willed and opinionated, but her head (not to mention her pride and prejudice) lead her heart astray when she meets the wealthy Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen), whose own sense of decency and discretion (not to mentionhispride and prejudice) prevent him from expressing his mutual affection. They're clearly meant for each other, and as Knightley's performance lights up the screen (still young enough to be girlishly impertinent, yet wise beyond her 20 years), Austen's timeless romance yields yet another timeless adaptation, easily on par with the belovedBBC miniseriesthat has been embraced by millions since originally broadcast in 1995. Individual tastes will vary as to which version should be considered \"definitive,\" but with a stellar supporting cast including Judi Dench and Donald Sutherland, this impeccable production achieves its own kind of perfection.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_viewed": ["0800141660", "B00003JRCQ", "B00G6HO368", "B004SIP7AS", "B004P7CNZO", "B0053Q9DHW", "B000244FDW", "B000GRUQKQ", "B000244FFU", "B0018YCF50", "B001L57ZZG", "B004XVMCMQ", "B00AF82WTO", "B008D1RCHC", "B000Z27HLS", "B000BEZQ0Y", "0767851013", "0486284735", "B0002ZH5PQ", "B0012Q3T6I", "6303921248", "B002XTBE6K", "B001PJRAUS", "B00HYMBAQ0", "B0080QOL1A", "B00062IZ0Y", "B001C4AFOY", "B0012XIGVE", "B002KHNFFS", "B000244FF0", "B0012OVCE6", "B00HYMASS6", "B0009UZGAA", "B000784WMW", "0767020308", "B000LPQ6DE", "B001TJYFRU", "B000FTCEYQ", "B000ZS8GW6", "B005GRF2UK", "B004FM2EL2", "B00G7QPXAI", "149440477X", "B009ERK0SW", "B00006ZXSK", "B0000AUHPK", "B004UOHNCA", "0767020294", "B00094AS9U", "B000Z27HMW", "B002DY9KR0", "B000N4SHOE", "B000683VI4", "193799418X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00G6HO368", "0800141660", "B00003JRCQ", "B005S9EK5Y"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JOHI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZGC68T2JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pride &amp; Prejudice"}

In 90 breathtaking minutes of efficient and intricate storytelling, writer-director George Clooney and cowriter Grant Heslov pay honorable tribute to the journalistic integrity of legendary CBS newscaster Edward R. Murrow,Director George Clooneywho confronted the virulent and overzealous anti-Communist witch-hunting of Wisconsin Sen. Joseph McCarthy in 1953-54, and emerged as a triumphant truth-seeker against the abuses of corporate and governmental power.David Strathairn as Edward R. MurrowAs played by David Strathairn, Murrow is a dogged realist, keenly aware of the smear tactics that will be employed against him; Clooney provides crucial backup as Murrow's \"See It Now\" producer and closest confidante Fred Friendly, forming a fierce but not entirely fearless triumvirate of broadcasting  bravery with CBS chief William Paley (Frank Langella), who anxiously champions Murrow's cause under constant threat of reprisals. While using crisp black-and-white cinematography (by Robert Elswit) to vividly recreate the electrifying atmosphere of the CBS newsroom and the early years of television, Clooney (son of long-time Cincinnati newsman Nick Clooney) proves his directorial skill by juggling big themes and an esteemed ensemble cast, never stooping to simplification of ethically complex material.Good Night, and Good Luckis an instant classic, destined for all the accolades it so richly deserves.--Jeff ShannonLearn More About Edward R.

{"description": "Scarecrow and Mrs. Kingproves there was life for Kate Jackson afterCharlie's Angels--and for Bruce Boxleitner beforeBabylon 5. Jackson's divorc&eacute;e, Amanda King, a pretty lady with an '80s perm, lives outside D.C. with her sons, Jamie and Phillip. At a train station, she meets Boxleitner's Lee \"Scarecrow\" Stetson, who convinces her to do a \"life or death\" favor. The delivery to the man in the red hat doesn't go as planned, but King ends up cracking the case and a new team ensues. Scarecrow's boss, Billy (Mel Stewart), thinks a housewife will make a perfect decoy, though fellow agent Francine (Martha Smith) has her doubts. As she says about her colleague, \"His methods might be unorthodox, but Scarecrow always delivers.\" Unfortunately for the apprentice agent, she can't tell anyone about her new career, not even her mother, Dotty (Beverly Garland, great value), who looks after the boys when she takes on assignments, offering different excuses every time. In Scarecrow, however, Amanda finds a friend as well as a partner--and a possible love interest, to judge from their longing glances.IfScarecrow and Mrs. Kingbears comparison withRemington Steele, the cases that deal with the domestic arena help to set it apart, with perpetrators ranging from cooking-show hosts to cosmetics titans. The more dramatic episodes don't work as well, mostly because they feel like retreads fromThe Rockford Files(executive producer Juanita Bartlett has written for both programs). Also, Jackson is a deft comic actress, but her crying scenes don't quite convince. Still, it's a minor complaint about a light entertainment that wasn't aiming for documentary realism. Plus, it's the chemistry between the leads that led to three more seasons--and Boxleitner'sGQgood looks certainly didn't hurt.--Kathleen C.

In an unprecedented demonstration of worldly citizenship, Eastwood (from a spare, tightly focused screenplay by first-time screenwriter Iris Yamashita) has crafted a truly Japanese film, with Japanese dialogue (with subtitles) and filmed in a contemplative Japanese style, serving as both complement and counterpoint to Eastwood's previously released companion filmFlags of Our Fathers. Where the earlier film employed a complex non-linear structure and epic-scale production values to dramatize one of the bloodiest battles of World War II and its traumatic impact on American soldiers,Lettersreveals the battle of Iwo Jima from the tunnel- and cave-dwelling perspective of the Japanese, hopelessly outnumbered, deprived of reinforcements, and doomed to die in inevitable defeat. While maintaining many of the traditions of the conventional war drama, Eastwood extends his sympathetic touch to humanize \"the enemy,\" revealing the internal and external conflicts of soldiers and officers alike, forced by circumstance to sacrifice themselves or defend their honor against insurmountable odds. From the weary reluctance of a young recruit named Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya) to the dignified yet desperately anguished strategy of Japanese commander Tadamichi Kuribayashi (played by Oscar-nominatedThe Last Samuraicostar Ken Watanabe), whose letters home inspired the film's title and present-day framing device,Letters from Iwo Jima(which conveys the bleakness of battle through a near-total absence of color) steadfastly avoids the glorification of war while paying honorable tribute to ill-fated men who can only dream of the comforts of home.--Jeff ShannonOn the DVDsLike the film itself, the two-disc special edition ofLetters from Iwo Jimais predominantly Japanese in content, and that's as it should be. Disc 1 presents the film in a  flawless widescreen transfer, with a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround soundtrack that perfectly captures the film's wide dynamic range. The optional subtitles can be turned off for those wishing to immerse themselves in a completely Japanese viewing experience. Disc 2 opens with \"Red Sun, Black Sand: The Making ofLetters from Iwo Jima,\" a 20-minute behind-the-scenes documentary that concisely covers all aspects of production, from director Clint Eastwood's initial decision to create a companion piece toFlags of Our Fathers, to interview comments from principal cast and crew, the latter includingFlagsscreenwriters Paul Haggis andLettersscreenwriter Iris Yamashita, costume designer Deborah Hopper, editor Joel Cox, cinematographer Tom Stern, production designer James Murakami (taking over for the ailing Henry Bumstead), and coproducer Rob Lorenz. \"The Faces of Combat\" is an 18-minute featurette about selecting the Japanese (and Japanese-American) cast ofLetters, and how they were chosen through the international collaboration of Eastwood's long-time casting director Phyllis Huffman (who turned over some of her duties to her son while struggling with terminal illness) and Japanese casting associate Yumi Takada, who filled important roles with Japanese celebrities (like pop star Kazunari Ninomiya, who plays \"Saigo\") and unknown actors alike.\"Images from the Frontlines\" is a 3.5-minute montage of images from the film and behind-the-scenes, set to the sparse piano theme of Eastwood's original score. The remaining bonus features chronicle the world premiere ofLettersin Tokyo on November 15, 2006. The premiere itself is covered in a 16-minute featurette taped at the famous Budokan arena, where we see the red-carpet procession, a full-capacity audience despite cold November weather, and introductory comments from the film's primary cast and crew, many of them quite moving with regard to the satisfaction of working on a film that helps Japanese viewers come to terms with a painful chapter of their history. The following day's press conference (at the Grand Hyatt Tokyo hotel) is a 24-minute Q&A; session covering much of the same territory, with additional testimony from principal cast & crew. Throughout this two-day event, it's clear that Eastwood (referring to himself as \"a Japanese director who doesn't speak the Japanese language\") was warmly embraced by the Japanese, and thatLetters from Iwo Jimahad served its intended purpose, reminding us of the horrors of war while uniting both Japanese and Americans in somber reflection, 61 years after the battle of Iwo Jima.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000M4RG42", "B00005PJ8T", "B00001ZWUS", "B00AEBBA36", "B001IBIHQ4", "B0015D20FE", "B00005JK8K", "B004U7MQWY", "0767802470", "B00AEFXVCU", "B00006CXSS", "B00275EGWY", "B000NTPG7A", "B00AEFXRRO", "B000065U1N", "B00003CXTG", "0792839730", "0792841409", "B007S0DCUU", "B000FVQLRA", "079284646X", "B00005PJ8S", "B0009RCPUC", "B003ASLJO0", "B00AEBB86U", "B00AEFXGIY", "B000EHSVS2", "B000P0J09C", "B003ASLJOU", "B002T9H2LA", "B000EHSVSC", "B00B0U2SFE", "B000AQ69QI", "B002O3Z4WU", "B006OFN0SE", "B003AWRMCO", "B0000BWVCR", "B00AEFYBA6", "B002O3Z510", "B00008K76U", "B00AEFYENK", "B0007TKNLA", "B003ASLJQS", "B003ASLJPE", "B00003CXHJ", "B003ASLJQI", "B00003CXA6", "B0007TKNGA", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00096S4B2", "B008XJM7T2", "0782010040", "B00004XPPC", "B001TUZG4K", "B003AWRMCE", "B009XTF8NI", "B002GHHHPQ", "B00CZB9BE8", "B00004XPPG", "B00AEFXN9G", "B0002V7ON8", "B00AEFXVOI", "B000H5V8H2", "B003ASLJKE", "B005GYSV4M", "B00005N5S3", "B0041H55H6", "B0076XTIWU", "B003AWRMC4", "B00AEFY5B6", "0800177967", "B00009OOFA", "B003ASLJMW", "0792838408", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B006TTC5HC", "B004DY1VIO", "B000NQQ4OM", "B000E5N6KW", "B003AWRMCY", "B00AEFY0F2", "B003UESJHO", "B00DL48BM6", "B003XMKU16", "B00AZNEW5G", "B003ELKNH2", "B0007P0YKY", "B000095WW8", "B002CPMB9O", "B000ELL1R6", "B000A2WJBQ", "B002ID09BM", "B0051HCVEU", "B002ZG97RE", "B0006VL1J2", "B0001GF2GU", "0792841662", "0792843576", "6304765258", "B000MGTQ7U"], "bought_together": ["B000M4RG42", "B00001ZWUS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000M4RG42", "B000P1XITE", "B00AEBBA36", "B00001ZWUS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 20999}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.44, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JPKE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51iZss0%2BzhL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Letters from Iwo Jima (Two-Disc Special Edition)"}
{"description": "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's Endis a rollicking voyage in the same spirit of the two earlierPiratesfilms, yet far darker in spots (and nearly three hours to boot). The action, largely revolving around a pirate alliance against the ruthless East India Trading Company, doesn't disappoint, though the violence is probably too harsh for young children. Through it all, the plucky cast (Keira Knightley, Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush) are buffeted by battle, maelstroms, betrayal, treachery, a ferocious Caribbean weather goddess, and that gnarly voyage back from the world's end--but with their wit intact. As always, Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow tosses off great lines ; he chastises \"a woman scorned, like which hell hath no fury than!\" He insults an opponent with a string of epithets, ending in \"yeasty codpiece.\"!In the previousThe Curse of the Black Pearl, Sparrow was killed--sent to Davy Jones' Locker. In the opening scenes, the viewer sees that death has  not been kind to Sparrow--but that's not to say he hasn't found endless ways to amuse himself, cavorting with dozens of hallucinated versions of himself on the deck of the Black Pearl. But Sparrow is needed in this world, so a daring rescue brings him back. Keith Richards' much ballyhooed appearance as Jack's dad is little more than a cameo, though he does play a wistful guitar. But the action, as always, is more than satisfying, held together by Depp, who, outsmarting the far-better-armed British yet again, causes a bewigged commander to muse: \"Do you think he plans it all out, or just makes it up as he goes along?\" As far as fans are concerned, it matters not.--A.T. HurleyOn the DVDHere's something you can't say about just any DVD extras: There appears to bemoreof Keith Richards in the outtakes, interviews, and other special features on theAt World's Enddisc than in the actual film. For those scenes alone, this special edition is well worth the price. Richards looks as woozy and gamey as all the rumors suggested, and answers questions he's not asked, with Johnny Depp sitting next to him, almost acting as a translator. Richards offers pithy comments like, \"Everything I do is original, you better believe,\" and smiles when other cast members call him \"Two-Take Richards\" for supposedly nailing his scenes.The packed second disc also includes a terrific mini-doc on how the filmmakers created the famous maelstrom, in an enormous hanger in Palmdale, California, with the ships floating 30 feet off the ground. \"Just moving theBlack Pearlwas an enormous undertaking,\" says producer Jerry Bruckheimer with serious understatement. Other cool extras include \"Tale of the Many Jacks,\" deleted scenes with great commentary, \"The World of Chow Yun-Fat,\" a bio of composer Hans Zimmer, features on the set designers, a look at the impressive Brethren Court, and some hilarious bloopers. \"You can't curse in a Disney film,\" deadpans Depp when a costar blurts out something blue. \"See? I told him.\" The extras are truly as much of a rollicking adventure as the film.--A.T.

{"description": "First released in France, Luc Besson'sArthur and the Invisiblesis a touching computer animated adventure that makes up in look and in character for what it lacks in narrative originality. As a direct hybrid ofExcaliburandA Bug's Life, Arthurstars a heroic ten year-old, Arthur (Freddie Highmore), who draws a sword from a stone to fight a miniature battle in the garden before finding treasure valuable enough to save his grandfather's farm from purchase by developers. Arthur's grandfather, Archibald, having long ago discovered the miniscule world of Minimoys, garden gnome-like elves that lived in his yard, shrunk himself in order to hunt elusive rubies that were hidden in their evil Mecropolis, headed by Maltazard (David Bowie). Now Arthur must assist the benevolent Minimoy clan, ruled by The King (Robert De Niro) and Princess Selenia (Madonna), in challenging Maltazard for possession of the jewels. Shots taking the viewer down through grass blades into the microscopic, yet gigantic yard world readjust one's sense of size, as do scenes, for example, in which a small, elven Arthur fights mosquitoes with catapulted tomatoes. Meanwhile, live action scenes of Arthur's worried grandmother (Mia Farrow) provide respite from a completely computerized world.

{"description": "\"I bought a car. Turned out to be an alien robot. Who knew?\" deadpans Sam Witwicky, hero and human heart of Michael Bay's rollicking robot-smackdown fest,Transformers. Witwicky (the sweetly nerdy Shia LaBeouf, channeling a young John Cusack) is the perfect counterpoint to the nearly nonstop exhilarating action. The plot is simple: an alien civil war (the Autobots vs. the evil Decepticons) has spilled onto Earth, and young Sam is caught in the fray by his newly purchased souped-up Camaro. Which has a mind--and identity, as a noble-warrior robot named Bumblebee--of its own. The effects, especially the mind-blowing transformations of the robots into their earthly forms and back again, are stellar.Fans of the earlier film and TV series will be thrilled at this cutting-edge incarnation, but this version should please all fans of high-adrenaline action. Director Bay gleefully salts the movie with homages to pop-culture touchstones likeRaiders of the Lost Ark,King Kong, and the early technothrillerWarGames. The actors, though clearly all supporting those kickass robots, are uniformly on-target, including the dashing Josh Duhamel as a U.S. Army sergeant fighting an enemy he never anticipated; Jon Voight, as a tough yet sympathetic Secretary of Defense in over his head; and John Turturro, whose special agent manages to be confidently unctuous, even stripped to his undies. But the film belongs to Bumblebee, Optimus Prime, and the dastardly Megatron--and the wicked stunts they collide in all over the globe. Long live Transformers! --A.T. HurleyOn the DVDThe special edition ofTransformersis packed with extras (and more than a few product placements for Hasbro). The entire second disc is devoted to featurettes on aspects of making the technical tour-de-force--and the land mines involved in tinkering with a beloved '80s franchise. Executive producer Steven Spielberg is very much a part of the proceedings, from his introductory comments (\"I think everybody likes the idea of taking something you're familiar with and turning it into something you're not so familiar with--like an 18-wheeler become Optimus Prime\") to mentions of his films that influenced this one, likeE.T.andClose Encounters of the Third Kind.Director Michael Bay is brash and entertaining as he talks about his initial reluctance to take on the project, his indoctrination at \"Transformers U\" at Hasbro, and his enthusiasm for guerrilla-style action filmmaking. Star Shia LaBoeuf says, \"He is the sickest action director\" out there, and there's plenty of evidence here to support that. Other great highlights include features on how key scenes were shot, including the heart-pounding desert battle and the shootout in the streets of downtown L.A.--adrenaline-pumping stuff, even without the Transformers CGI'd in. --A.T.

{"description": "You know you're going to get a different kind of superhero when you cast Robert Downey Jr. in the lead role. AndIron Manis different, in welcome ways. Cleverly updated from Marvel Comics' longstanding series,Iron Manputs billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (that's Downey) in the path of some Middle Eastern terrorists; in a brilliantly paced section, Stark invents an indestructible suit that allows him to escape. If the rest of the movie never quite hits that precise rhythm again, it nevertheless offers plenty of pleasure, as the renewed Stark swears off his past as a weapons manufacturer, develops his new Iron Man suit, and puzzles both his business partner (Jeff Bridges in great form) and executive assistant (Gwyneth Paltrow). Director Jon Favreau geeks out in fun ways with the hardware, but never lets it overpower the movie, and there's always a goofy one-liner or a slapstick pratfall around to break the tension. As for Downey, he doesn't get to jitterbug around too much in his improv way, but he brings enough of his unpredictable personality to keep the thing fresh. And listen up, hardcore Marvel mavens: even if you know the Stan Lee cameo is coming, you won't be able to guess it until it's on the screen. It all builds to a splendid final scene, with a concluding line delivery by Downey that just feels absolutely right.--Robert HortonStills fromIron Man(Click for larger image)&nbsp;", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00E5I2M6I", "B008JFUO72", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00E5I2MEK", "B0083SBMBM", "B008JFUS0U", "B001CDR1FG", "B00E5I2MAO", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001GCUO1Q", "B008JFUPFI", "B000VI70QS", "B000HEVZ9E", "B0000959N0", "B00005JKCH", "B00005JNJV", "B00005JNTU", "B0090SI56Y", "B000VR0570", "B00005JMQW", "B002HWRYJE", "B0007P0Y7C", "B004LWZW42", "B00D7OMNXS", "B001OQCV6A", "B007K3JFUQ", "B004EPZ07K", "B004LWZWGA", "B000UR9T8C", "B0083SBJXS", "B0060FXDCG", "B002IPFWTE", "B00E5I2ME0", "B00IXD2MGQ", "B000AYELVA", "B00C6B8TB8", "B008QZ5PY2", "B000OVLBF8", "B000AYELVU", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001QB9H1U", "B009JBWOU0", "B001AK3S4Y", "B001GZ6QC4", "B005G4TJUC", "B002NXSRVG", "B000HCO83Q", "B003YOZNBU", "B003Q6D2B4", "B00023B1LC", "B0002IQMAM", "B008JFURII", "B00HERGM86", "B00E5I2MDQ", "B006VRRGNK", "B002ZG99QS", "B00000JQB5", "B007REV4T8", "B00008G8M5", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B0002ZDVEU", "6305718954", "B001DTPZNY", "B005LAIGW8", "B001F7MSFM", "B001GCUNWQ", "B00A2H9P98", "B000RW3VDE", "B002O5M4T4", "B00005JA8B", "B005LAIIPS", "B005LAII44", "B00BEIYHO2", "B000GUJZ00", "B00005N5S5", "B002SJIO4A", "B000VWYJ86", "B004EPZ0BG", "B0049IHX2C", "B00AEBBAEK", "B00005JM5E", "B008JFUOWM", "B000FS9FCG", "B00005PJ6N", "B00979KQFO", "B00AEFXKUI", "B002K0WBXW", "B0042U94UQ", "B004EPYZUS", "B008JFUQZ2", "B0084IG8TM", "B001DJLD1M", "B008JFUS5A", "B00006HBUJ", "B000J103OI", "B00F84H73Q", "B0087ZG7NO", "B000U1ZV8K"], "bought_together": ["B00E5I2M6I", "B008JFUO72"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008JFUO72", "B00E5I2M6I", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2MEK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12121}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "DOWNEY,ROBERT JR.", "asin": "B00005JPS8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515wjJQt2nL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Iron Man (Ultimate 2 Disc Edition)"}
{"description": "Here's hoping James Mangold's big, raucous, and ultrabloody remake of3:10 to Yumaleads some moviegoers to check outDelmer Daves's beautifully lean, half-century-old original. That classic Western spun a tale of captured outlaw Ben Wade (Glenn Ford)--deadly but disarmingly affable--and the small-time rancher and family man, Dan Evans (Van Heflin), desperate enough to accept the job of helping escort the badman to Yuma prison. Wade, knowing that his gang will be along at any moment to spring him, works at persuading the ultimately lone deputy to accept a bribe, turn his back on \"duty,\" and go home safe and rich to his family. That the outlaw has come to admire his captor intriguingly complicates the suspense.All of the above applies in the new3:10, but it takes a lot more huffing and puffing to get Wade (Russell Crowe this time) and Evans (Christian Bale) into position for the showdown. Mostly, more is less. To Mangold's credit, his movie doesn't traffic in facile irony or postmodern detachment; it aims to be a straight-up Western and deliver the excitement and charisma the genre's fans are starved for. But recognizing that contemporary viewers might be out of touch with the bedrock simplicity and strength of the genre--not to mention its code of honor--Mangold has supplied both Evans and Wade with a plethora of backstory and \"motivations.\" At the overblown action climax, the crossfire of personal agendas is almost as frenetic as the copious gunplay. (By that point the movie has killed more people than the Lincoln County War.)Best thing about the remake is Russell Crowe's Ben Wade, a Scripture-quoting career villain with an artist's eye and a curiously principled sense of whom and when to murder. As his second-in-command, Ben Foster fairly pirouettes at every opportunity to commit mayhem, and Peter Fonda contributes a fierce portrait of an old Wade adversary turned bounty hunter for the Pinkerton detective agency.--Richard T.

{"description": "The Dark Knightarrives with tremendous hype (best superhero movie ever? posthumous Oscar for Heath Ledger?), and incredibly, it lives up to all of it.  But calling it the best superhero movie ever seems like faint praise, since part of what makes the movie great--in addition to pitch-perfect casting, outstanding writing, and a compelling vision--is that it bypasses the normal fantasy element of the superhero genre and makes it all terrifyingly real.  Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is Gotham City's new district attorney, charged with cleaning up the crime rings that have paralyzed the city. He enters an uneasy alliance with the young police lieutenant, Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), and Batman (Christian Bale), the caped vigilante who seems to trust only Gordon--and whom only Gordon seems to trust. They make progress until a psychotic and deadly new player enters the game: the Joker (Heath Ledger), who offers the crime bosses a solution--kill the Batman. Further complicating matters is that Dent is now dating Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, after Katie Holmes turned down the chance to reprise her role), the longtime love of Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne.In his last completed role before his tragic death, Ledger is fantastic as the Joker, a volcanic, truly frightening force of evil. And he sets the tone of the movie: the world is a dark, dangerous place where there are no easy choices.  Eckhart and Oldman also shine, but as good as Bale is, his character turns out rather bland in comparison (not uncommon for heroes facing more colorful villains). Director-cowriter Christopher Nolan (Memento) follows his critically acclaimedBatman Beginswith an even better sequel that sets itself apart from notable superhero movies likeSpider-Man 2andIron Manbecause of its sheer emotional impact and striking sense of realism--there are no suspension-of-disbelief superpowers here. At 152 minutes, it's a shade too long, and it's much too intense for kids. But for most movie fans--and not just superhero fans--The Dark Knightis a film for the ages.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B000PC6A3E", "B002ZG981E", "B00G4RD4PQ", "B0039208QM", "B001GMALGY", "B00E2Y0YBK", "B00C2IGQBA", "B0039208JE", "B00H14WTLQ", "B0039208CG", "B0085D3I3K", "B0039208C6", "B000M5AJQI", "B00319ECGK", "B001FB55H6", "B00EIG5M5A", "7020070078", "B00E2Y6AUY", "B00D5FMGGS", "B001OQCV6K", "B0013FBS20", "B000Q6GX5Y", "B001GKJ2FC", "B00FPS79F6", "B001992NUQ", "B004JMSIRC", "B001RIY4WE", "B00DYEN6XC", "B008QZ5PY2", "B001F7MSG6", "B00FAHYNWE", "B00J7PRJXU", "B001AQT0Z4", "B001UV4XEW", "B0083SBJXS", "B00AEFY552", "B00C8RD79O", "B007KAJG3K", "B007L4HET8", "B004EPZ07U", "B007L4HFDI", "B00AEFXKOO", "B000PC0U1W", "B00C6B8TB8", "B00HINFI4K", "B003TT2X6I", "B001KZIRM2", "B002ZG99NG", "B00EZ4M68G", "B004SIP90G", "B003ZHR6RK", "B001GCUO16", "B003TT2X6S", "B00JNEWSLS", "B001F3FUK6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B002ZG981E", "B000PC6A3E"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPY0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pGxSkkz4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Dark Knight [Theatrical Release]"}

But it is not until another stranger, the handsome Roux (Johnny Depp -- SLEEPY HOLLOW), arrives in town that Vianne is finally able to recognize her own desires!", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SEUIXS", "B004XVMCMG", "B0000VD02Y", "0780621611", "B000LXHK2C", "0140282033", "B000053VAZ", "B004SIP9U6", "B002RSDW80", "B0034PHWG8", "B00008G7UF", "B004SIP7PS", "B00006ZXSI", "B0042816YK", "B004SIP7F8", "B00005TNEQ", "B004SIP7D0", "B000F7CECK", "B00AEBB9F0", "B000CBG5PG", "0783240171", "B000ETRCN0", "B002ZG988M", "B00005R87R", "B000EHRVOW", "B003B3V0W0", "B00166UFTS", "B004SIP6C2", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00005JKG1", "B001LPWGBY", "B004SEUJK0", "B000UVV26A", "B0000AOV4I", "B00005JPSM", "630560097X", "B00L16P1I8", "B0011FLH14", "B005S9EJ14", "B00CEIOGZG", "B005CFBZX4", "B000YDBPAM", "B00EIBO8T6", "B001HN69AY", "B004SIP9RO", "B004SIP8JI", "B005MYEQ4U", "B0073U2EWM", "B00AEBBA72", "B0000CE684", "B00KQTGWPC", "B005ETAM4Q", "0147509785", "B0062VL4QA", "6305133468", "B001HN694K", "B00AZMFO6I", "B00006ZXSK", "B000LPR4U8", "B00006FMUW", "B000C8STWQ", "B000CCBCAS", "B007UW9W5U", "B001NLJ3NU", "B000BB1MI2", "B0045HCJJY", "B00DW5ILUG", "B00AEBB8OC", "B006ISJQ1W", "B0002234LS", "6305212112", "B000HT3PPG", "B001ECDVK4", "B0009OL7Z4", "B0001I55M4", "B000EDWKXI", "B00001W9G0", "B00004X13T", "B004SIP8W0", "B00000K3TN", "B0064MT1FI", "6305213283", "6304765266", "0800141741", "B000BNX3B4", "076782170X", "B00AEFY4CG", "B000056PMU", "B000F3UAFC", "B00003CXPD", "B000023VTP", "B0038N9WKU", "6304907729", "6305291403", "B00003A9QI", "B004GJYRA0", "B000077VR3", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00008G8LG", "B000RF7XYO"], "bought_together": ["B004SEUIXS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004SEUIXS", "B00C888MJ8", "B0000VD02Y", "0140282033"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 66054}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.98, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005K3OT", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BVvKaN4EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Chocolat (Miramax Collector's Series)"}
{"description": "The long road toPollockbegan when actor Ed Harris received a biography of Jackson Pollock from his father, who noticed that his son bore an uncanny resemblance to the artist. Harris's fascination with Pollock matched his physical similarity; the actor chose to direct and star in this impressive film biography. And his devotion assured a work of singular integrity, honoring the artist's achievement in abstract expressionism while acknowledging that Pollock was a tormented, manic-depressive alcoholic whose death at 44 (in a possibly suicidal car crash) also claimed the life of an innocent woman. The film also suggests that Pollock's success was largely attributable to the devotion of his wife, artist Lee Krasner, played with matching ferocity by Marcia Gay Harden in an Oscar&reg;-winning performance.In many respects a traditional biopic,Pollockbegins in 1941 when Pollock meets Krasner, who encourages him and attracts the attention of supportive critic Clement Greenberg (Jeffrey Tambor) and benefactor Peggy Guggenheim (Amy Madigan). As Pollock rises from obscurity to international acclaim, Harris brings careful balance to his portrayal of a driven creator who found peace during those brief, sober periods when art brought release from his tenacious inner demons. The film offers sympathy without sentiment, appreciation without misguided hagiography. As an acting showcase it's utterly captivating. As a compassionate but unflinching exploration of Jackson Pollock's intimate world, there's no doubt that Harris captured the essence of a man whose life was as torturous as his art was redeeming.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0030T120A", "B005TTEG3O", "B004SIP7S0", "B003ODIV10", "B000BYA4HY", "B0041I97CO", "B00116GEJ8", "B001CK7OM4", "B001CK7OLU", "B000WZAE7W", "B0043CT8GI", "B000AL72R8", "B000NVI0EY", "B002ZMZBIM", "B0001US61O", "B0051URXWM", "B003WKQ46E", "B0026BTRUK", "B003VTKZ8O", "B003MWHUMY", "B000CCCZYA", "0810984962", "B0009X7BHI", "B000GEIREQ", "B0006GANX2", "B000092T3B", "B001O7R768", "B008BWFP18", "B000053VBM", "B000IHYXK8", "B00470MG06", "B000YKYT2G", "B00EV1YZKK", "B004U7MR1Y", "B003ELMR8U", "B009B8YZ8U", "B001BWYT4E", "B000055XMV", "B003BR8MDQ", "0913391190", "3836512769", "B0031REQKE", "B000NO1XG8", "B000H6SXSI", "B002RB56WM", "B0064MT1SA", "B00HQF9UPI", "B00005AUKF", "B000E3LCXW", "B000QGDXG6", "B00BQXTDEO", "B003ELMR80", "B000KN7C1W", "B0011IR2R4", "B0077PBPNM", "B005DNDUEW", "B004CJQVQC", "B0007PALGG", "B003JHXS1E", "B0087HDEGA", "B0056G1ARU", "B000053VAV", "B0000TPAQA", "B000E3LCXC", "0226074064", "3822821357", "0060973676", "B0064MT1FI", "B002LC3M8M", "B004CYVZ5E", "6304712936", "B001P3SA8K", "B00003CXPV", "B000FFJYCK", "0780619587", "B00004STD8", "B004XVMCNK", "B003L16F5Y", "B000E33VWW", "B0011NVC8Y", "B004SUDQ8G", "B00B5EC9BI", "B0041I97C4", "B005J4TLQ6", "B0041KKYEM", "B0043CT8GS", "B0009U6XD4", "B0011FLH14", "B00005UQ7S", "B0002JL9N6", "B00003CWN3", "B00GUO2SKA", "B002SF9YUM", "B0006A9I2U", "0792845803", "B000063N9O", "B00441GZ00", "B00CBFB8SU", "0815410093"], "bought_together": ["B004SIP7S0", "B0030T120A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004SIP7S0", "B0030T120A", "B000BYA4HY", "B0006GANX2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 16504}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.99, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00005KHJJ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P6XQX68ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pollock (Special Edition)"}

ButTomcatsisn't quite as brain-dead as that, though it is phenomenally more neurotic.

O'Connell needs the money to pay off a gambling debt, but his problem is that the other bachelor is a horrendous pig (Jake Busey) unlikely ever to land a gal. A general mean-spiritedness flows through this wearying comedy, manifest in such ugly moments as watching someone's girlfriend run over by a golf cart and an excised, cancerous testicle kicked around hospital hallways.

{"description": "Frank Lloyd Wright was the greatest of all American architects. He was an authentic American genius, a man who believed he was destined to redesign the world, creating everything anew. Over the course of his long career, Wright designed over eight hundred buildings, including such revolutionary structures as the Guggenheim Museum, the Johnson Wax Building, Fallingwater, Unity Temple and Taliesin. Wright's buildings and his ideas changed the way we live, work and see the world around us. Frank Lloyd Wright's architectural achievements were often overshadowed by the turbulence of his melodramatic life. In ninety-two years, he fathered seven children, married three times, and almost constantly embroiled scandal. Some hated him, some loved him, but in the end, few could deny that he was the most important architect in America   and perhaps the world. With exquisite live cinematography, fascinating interviews, and rare archival footage, this riveting film brings Wright's unforgettable story to life.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005LVO6QC", "B000EHQWOW", "0764932438", "B000BITUH0", "B000BITUJS", "B000BITUI4", "B0009K7RXO", "B0017ZBLLE"], "bought_together": ["B000EHQWOW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BITUH0", "B000EHQWOW", "B0009K7RXO", "B000BITUJS"]}, "price": 21.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 129174}, "asin": "B00005MEPO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H9K7Z73CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Frank Lloyd Wright: A Film by Ken Burns and Lynn Novick"}
{"description": "Along withMonty Python's Flying Circus,The Avengerspractically defined British cult television, and it was never better than during the three years that Diana Rigg's Emma Peel character tossed out her witty barbs and karate kicks.The Complete Emma Peel Megasetencompasses all 51 episodes from 1965-66 (in black and white) and 1967 (in color).  Paired with Patrick Macnee as the dapper, umbrella-wielding John Steed, Rigg's Mrs. Peel turned heads with her sexy outfits, then broke skulls of the various would-be world-dominating bad guys who crossed her path.  Like the mixed crime-fighting teams who came after them in shows likeMoonlightingandThe X-Files, Steed and Mrs. Peel had a constant platonic playfulness.  In one episode when Mrs. Peel is working undercover at a department store, Steed drops in for a visit, remarking, \"They told me 'Mrs. Peel is in Ladies Underwear.'  I rattled up the stairs three at a time.\" However, unlike their spiritual successors, Steed and Mrs. Peel never jumped the shark; instead she bid a fond farewell as she passed the torch to Steed's next partner, Tara King (Linda Thorson), just as she had been passed the torch from Honor Blackman.  (Blackman left her Kathy Gale character to go on to fame as Pussy Galore inGoldfinger--in one episode, Steed receives a postcard from Gale sent from Fort Knox.)  But although Macnee had some enjoyable moments with other partners throughout the series' run, it's the Emma Peel years that fans remember most fondly, not only for the great chemistry between the lead actors, but the superb writing and distinctly British, and distinctly '60s, quirky charm.

{"description": "The Daughter of the Regimentseems to burst over with Gallic wit and charm.  It tells a tale of young love--frustrated, then victorious--and gave the composer Donizetti ample chances to write military rhythms, pastoral mood music, and passionate love exchanges, as well as to create a role that any prima donna would fight to perform. The story centers on the waif Marie, who is adopted by a French army regiment, falls in love with a Tyrolean youth called Tonio, but is carried off to live with the Marquise of Berkenfeld, who plans to turn her into a genteel lady and marry her to an aristocrat.  But at the final curtain, the Marquise (who turns out to be her long-lost mother) relents and lets her marry Tonio.This Australian Opera production was praised as such: \"Dame Joan Sutherland has made the cute heroine Marie as much her own as the tragic Lucia. Sutherland tossed off the soprano's florid runs and trills like a lark ascending while romping around the stage with the tongue-in-cheek nonchalance of a born comedian.  The supporting cast was splendid both vocally and histrionically.\"  --The Australian. \"The Daughter of the Regimentis purely opera as entertainment.  However, it does demand exceptionally fine singing.  On both counts, for vocal splendor and for entertainment, it succeeds admirably.\"--Canberra TimesCast:Joan Sutherland: MarieAnson Austin: TonioHeather Begg: MarquesaGregory Yurisich: SulpiceGordon Wlcocs: HortensioMarie-Claire: Duquesa", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FII2ES", "B00005AAEX", "B000B8ISPK", "B0000687EC", "B0013V33DG", "B00I3LDEFQ", "B0009W4LLS", "B00CIWPJ0Y", "B0000640T8", "B003ELZL0Q", "B000FII2E8", "B000EQHHJW", "B00005NGA8", "B000Y9M09G", "B000T0XEGS", "B000094HMU", "B000065B0C", "B00005RIXJ", "B0000687ED", "B00004ZEQF", "B006ZRAF0C", "B00008DDRL", "B007N0SW0A", "B00005UW8C", "B000VZAV62", "B002Y5FKUE", "B000VLYIW4", "6305078637", "B00066K2QU", "B0002TTTGU", "B0009YBYSE", "B0006VC3OO", "B00004Y2QP", "B00006CXFD", "B000A3XZ0E", "B000JJSRN4", "B0000640T2", "B00005OSLJ", "B00002NDLW", "B00008DDUN", "B00066K2R4", "B002S9USSU", "B000AYJCRS", "B0007OC7EQ", "B0007TFI9W", "B0094AH3MU", "B0002TXT2U", "B000050X2Y", "B000E5KOJI", "B000EQHHK6", "B000JJSRMU", "B0009X24RA", "B00195FUG4", "B0009K1ZHS", "B000093FQI", "B0041XSC4I", "B0002TTTK6", "B0007RO54I", "B000055XTE", "B000E5KOJS", "B0012EF7MO", "B008XNPNO4", "B008L1VZS6", "B0000631A9", "B00009PY2C", "B000VJ271A", "B000FIMG7M", "B0012L0TFM", "B000F3TAO4", "B000GPPPXQ", "B008HC9982"], "bought_together": ["B000FII2ES", "B000B8ISPK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0013V33DG", "B0000041QJ", "B000F3T3CS", "B000FIGXGM"]}, "price": 17.96, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Classical"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Opera & Classical Vocal"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 311530}, "asin": "B00005RIXO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Gbf0KTGfL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gaetano Donizetti: La Fille du Regiment - Opera Australia"}

{"description": "This ambitious miniseries begins with Jack's descendant (Matthew Modine) and works its way backward to the story of the original young man and the beanstalk. Because the first Jack used that towering vine to steal a giant's magic goose and harp, an entire world was reduced to poverty and a bloodline was cursed--all Robinson men die in their 40s, and the modern-day Jack is around that age. Fortunately, Ondine (Mia Sara), a visitor from the giant's alternative reality, has a plan. If she and Jack can recover the stolen items in time, they may be able to solve both problems. The made-for-TV movie boasts top stars (including Vanessa Redgrave and Jon Voight) and Jim Henson's Creature Shop's nifty special effects. Although children younger than 10 may find the complex narrative confusing and the implied violence scary,Jack and the Beanstalkis an inventive retelling that adds new life to an old story.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "The episodes in this collection conclude theNew Generation/Mospeadastory line--and the entire series. As the war between the Earthlings and the alien Invid escalates, the Regis of the Invid creates two additional \"Invid larvae humanoids\" (aliens in human form), Sera and Corg. Sera argues for understanding between species, while Corg becomes a fanatic warrior. Meanwhile, Lieutenant Scott Bernard and his motley crew of freedom fighters prepare to join Admiral Rick Hunter's returning star fleet for a final attack on the Invid stronghold. Faced with imminent defeat, the Regis, who invaded Earth and enslaved humanity, delivers an address denouncing war to Scott's crew and transports her people \"to a higher plane.\" Only Marlene/Ariel and Sera remain, and their romances with Scott and Lancer parallel the peace-through-intermarriage theme that began with Max and the Zentraedi Miriya in theMacrosscontinuity. It's a surprisingly lame conclusion to three interstellar wars. This early sci-fi epic helped foster an audience for Japanese animation in America and was created by the producers at Harmony Gold, who edited together the unrelated seriesSuper Dimension Fortress: Macross,Genesis Climber Mospeada, andSuper Dimensional Cavalry Southern Cross.

{"description": "These brief (30 minutes total), silly adventures use a few elements of Lewis Carroll's \"Alice\" stories as a premise. The title character has been transformed into a blond teenager in a sailor suit; all the other characters have been recast as curvaceous women in scanty costumes. The White Rabbit is a Playboy bunny, years after the last Playboy Club closed. The Cheshire Cat attempts to seduce Miyuki; the Queen of Hearts (who wears a dominatrix costume) cracks a whip and tries to make Miyuki kiss her boots. Of course, it's all a dream, but not a pleasant one. Western viewers may have trouble understanding why the all-female Clamp studio would make such a sophomoric example of fan-service sexism. Perhaps the material plays differently in Japan, but it's difficult to see how.

{"description": "Seething passions, wandering ghosts, and an unexploded bomb fill this beautifully filmed tale of war and suspense. ThoughThe Devil's Backbonewas advertised as a horror movie in the States, it's really more of a drama that happens to have ghosts in it. During the Spanish Civil War, young Carlos is abandoned at a completely isolated orphanage. The tensions therein have been building for years, exacerbated by the unexploded bomb resting menacingly in the courtyard. Bullies scheme, tempers flare, and a ghost that visits Carlos's bed seems to be the key to it all. The movie is full of excellent performances, especially by Marisa Paredes as the gruff-but-kind headmistress, Eduardo Noriega as the handyman with secrets to keep, and Federico Luppi as the benevolent professor who likes to keep deformed fetuses in jars.

First-time director Roman Coppola (son of Francis) creates a slight but fun picture steeped in 1960s movie lore: the film-within-a-film is a pop-art spectacle that recallsBarbarella,Modesty Blaise, andDanger: Diabolique, while its Italian producer (Giancarlo Giannini) is a high-living Dino De Laurentiis. If the film is slight, the details are right, from the opulent and outrageous sets to the meticulously retro special effects to the groovy music by Mellow. You could think ofCQas Coppola's8&#xBD;, about a man so busy filming his life he forgets to live.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000067J18", "B00LT1JHLW", "B00LNBQ8SI", "B00LMCDHMS", "B0000645I7", "B000066JBR", "B006YZOXHQ", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B0002L57XC", "B000067J17", "B00J5LXMTG", "B00KLSSKA8", "B000228EJA", "B00K0MM4AM", "B008FYZHPG", "B00JAQJNN0", "B00HNTOVX8", "B00000IREA", "B00K31RBYY", "B00BLF9FTA", "B00BN3DTVK", "B0001XAOBG", "B000HT3PF6", "B00AWWX6XY", "B00F3L8P26", "B00H3JHHSE", "B00JPS6A3O", "B006UKX6GO", "B00013YT3A", "B00008K7AG", "B00009IB1F", "B0000589U8", "B00GDDNFDW", "B006A8XFSA", "B000C65ZA2", "B00D9EJFV4", "B00DBNLBAQ", "B0002C9DJU", "B00DYVU9K8", "B000TZJCNM", "B00EMAGK1W", "B008RNYMPG", "B008CB8CJK", "B000NY1E9E", "B00HUCF6KK", "B00E8G5H8W", "B00DOZNI8Y", "B0009RCPWK", "B00CPTUO1Y", "B000BTITYE", "B001J710Y8", "B00EIL7IKW", "B000R348QW", "B0026LYMFU", "B00005K3OF", "B00DOZNEG0", "B00008H2HK", "B00BC75H5S", "B00B2BYXSG", "B00B0LKVIY", "B000XCK0OQ", "B000025AQB", "B0045HCJ9O", "B001993Y1S", "B00DPUB56U", "B0024HH32A", "B003PIUINS", "B008OHV5R8", "B009L6S5EC", "B009POCFTG", "B00AJXO4FA", "B0055OG2BC", "B00441GYVK", "B008ERNLTS", "B001BGS17Q", "B005JZBP4Q", "B00007L1KE", "B00009NHC5"], "bought_together": ["B000067J18"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000067J18", "B000228EJA", "B000066JBR", "B000HT3PF6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 91722}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.54, "brand": "Davis", "asin": "B00006CXH2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EiahXZzVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "CQ"}

So everyone worries: what will become of Toula? Then one day she sees the ultimate unattainable guy and realizes the only way her life will get better is if he gets away from her big, fat Greek family. Toula escapes from the family restaurant. She exchanges her seating hostess jacket for a college diploma, convinces her aunt to give her a new job, and trades in her coke-bottle glasses for contact lenses, just in time for \"him\" to walk back into her life. Ian Miller is tall, handsome but defnitely not Greek. Their courtship is an Olympian culture clash. Can Ian handle Toula, her parents, her aunts, uncles, cousins and several centuries of Greek heritage? Will Toula discover the love she's been missing right in the heart of her big, fat family?

When \"Uncle Sy's\" picture-perfect fantasy collides with an ugly dose of reality, what happens next \"has the spine-tingling elements of the best psychological crime thrillers!\" (The New York Observer)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00079HZOS", "B003LR5BD0", "B004SUDQB8", "B0043X1FM2", "B0043X1FL8", "B000N4RAR4", "B00000IQV7", "B00008L3U1", "B002PI1NRO", "B00005JLX2", "B000U1ZV76", "630587493X", "B000B8QG22", "B00006AUJR", "B00003CXZ4", "B00000G02H", "B000LC5B7O", "B00AEFXESQ", "B000J3FBDO", "B000GI3KGC", "6305262128", "B0000633R5", "B00003CWS3", "B00005JL5F", "B000FDEVA2", "B00005QCTY", "B00007GZR5", "B00009MEC4", "B00005V9HT", "B003ASLJQS", "B0018O4YT0", "B00005JPQE", "B00009W5CA", "B00092ZLSK", "6305213305", "B000069HZP", "B00011CZRE", "B004FQX5B6", "B0002234LS", "B00AEFYYH6", "B00005NKT5", "B000QQLVPQ", "B004XVMCKS", "6304584210", "B000031EGV", "B0009A40ES", "B001R3YRG2", "B00H9L26AA", "B00AEBBA4K", "B000CS464G", "B000286RNE", "B0001US62I", "B00009WVSL", "B000CNESTE", "B000A2UBN4", "B00012QLB4", "B0010YVCI4", "0790742047", "B00018D42W", "0767802519", "B000CQLZ0Q", "6305065551", "B000Q66Q8I", "B000V4UFZK", "B000E33VWW", "B0021L8UPS", "B00008EY9G", "B000067IZ3", "0792833198", "B00005JLRE", "078322933X", "B00AEBB89W", "B003ELMR9E", "B00003CWTL", "B002PLPQLU", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B00003CXWV", "B003AWRM9M", "B002NZK5RI", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000BX8R1A", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B00008975Z", "B00I31COHA", "B00195I3O0", "B00003CXCF", "B004SIP95G", "B00H9HZITU", "B0045O2PHS", "1558908404", "0767830555", "B0000VV5DA", "B0002O7XW2", "B00006RCNV", "B000LP6KNU", "B003U6SJYU", "B000U7169M", "B000P0J0AG", "6305144168", "B00441GYPG"], "bought_together": ["B003LR5BD0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00079HZOS", "B003LR5BD0", "630587493X", "B00003CWL6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 126823}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.24, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00007976T", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XX12WQGXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "One Hour Photo (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Dirk Bogarde risked his career to make this 1962 film about a lawyer who risks his career to stand up to blackmailers. Part crime thriller and part plea for tolerance,Victimuses the terror of a blackmailing ring to point out the injustice of Britain's antisodomy laws. Bogarde plays Melville Farr, a married lawyer who learns of a blackmail scheme when one of its victims, an old friend, commits suicide rather than tell the police. As Farr conducts an investigation, he must confront his own past.Victimwas ahead of its time--it was the first English-language movie to use the word \"homosexual\"--and as such it seems quaint and stilted at times. Straw-man clich&#xE9;s about homosexuality must be knocked down, and, like in all first-wave issue movies, occasionally characters need to have rather stilted debates. Still, the crime plot stands on its own, the performances are excellent, and the film is brave enough to make some very good points.

{"description": "To the ranks of shows too brilliant and outrageous for prime time (The Ben Stiller Show,Andy Richter Controls the Universe), add Seth McFarlane'sFamily Guy. This animated series, which debuted after the 1999 Super Bowl, simply sparked too much controversy and offended too many sensibilities to survive (Entertainment Weeklydubbed it \"the Awful Show They Just Keep Putting on the Air\"). That the Fox network also played hackysack with its schedule, ensuring viewers would not be able to find it, sealed its fate (it was cancelled in 2002). This boxed set containing all 28 episodes from the first two seasons is payback for the show's devoted cult following, who may be moved to echo the words of infant Stewie Griffin, the megalomaniacal 1-year-old bent on matricide and world domination: \"Victory is mine!\"The dysfunctional Griffins of Quahog, Rhode Island, invite comparisons toThe Simpsons. The testicular-chinned father, Peter Griffin, is a clueless oaf in the Homer mold. \"Peter, what did you promise me last night?\" asks his long-suffering wife Lois in one episode. \"That I wouldn't drink at the stag party,\" he replies. \"And what did you do?\" she asks. \"Drank at the stag part--oh ho ho, I almost walked into that one,\" he cackles. Other family members include teenage daughter Meg, a desperate high school social pariah; 13-year-old son Chris, a chip off his father's blockhead; and Brian, the family's sarcastic talking dog. But this series' true inspiration is football-pated Stewie (voiced by McFarlane, who earned an Emmy), who was born to be a Bond villain once he escaped his mother's \"ovarian bastille.\"Family Guyrecklessly ventured whereThe Simpsonsfeared to tread. In one episode, Meg's one and only friend turns out to be the member of a suicidal cult. In another, Death (voiced by Norm McDonald) becomes an unwanted houseguest. Each episode plays fast and furious with surreal flashes (in one episode, Peter turns his house into a puppet) and pop-culture references and TV, movie, and commercial parodies that invite repeated viewings. Freed from its own family-hour bastille and the whims of dim network executives,Family Guycan be appreciated at last on its own profane, sacrilegious, and irreverent terms. Welcome to the DVD family, Griffins.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008YGRV", "B000AQ68Z0", "B000HT3P6U", "B000RO6JZO", "B0012018OE", "B001VFM0ZG", "B003DZX46G", "B003L77G9W", "B0058YPMHO", "B00E0FW054", "B000E6ES9O", "B000A3DFV8", "B00FR81Z40", "B003V3FVQ6", "B000NNK4DM", "B0006B41GM", "B0040JHX0W", "B0012KSUTA", "B001N9VW5Y", "B001RIZ7OI", "B003X4KHRG", "B002LARYTW", "B002JVWQYG", "B00023P49C", "B003CN5B7E", "B000YOX3HE", "B008412UKA", "B0053O8A32", "B0058RN7KA", "B003L77G7Y", "B00023P49M", "B007KFZ85K", "B000E0OE3K", "B00008YGRS", "B0000CABL2", "B00LFW6BA0", "B00BYNL8DU", "B0001ZWLVU", "B008412UQ4", "B004696M94", "B007KFZ7UQ", "B005QIOJUI", "B0044E9JTG", "B007KFZ88M", "B000RW3VDE", "B009SQ9Q5M", "B00A2JFNSS", "B0018RKEQE", "B007KFZ7PG", "B000067DNE", "B007KFZ7YM", "B007KFZ8AK", "B001L1S1PS", "B0001MZ7KA", "B000CNESM6", "B002LASCJ8", "B007KFZ87S", "B007KFZ7Q0", "B0002WZRSG", "B004MLEYTG", "B0006Z2L2Y", "B007KFZ8AA", "B00005JM3G", "B008OTH56Q", "B000ADWCYY", "B007ZFR67I", "B000B5XOR0", "B000FSME2Y", "B0044E9JSW", "B000FEBWTE", "B000B5XOWU", "B0000C2IQB", "B008AITJ7O", "B00000F5W8", "B007KFZ8B4", "B00005JOHC", "B005CGI4EG", "B0086UVMEE", "B000W91RUG", "B0024FAR6Q", "B000ERVJNG", "B003L77G6U", "B0060OKO2O", "B00BUWD7Y8", "B006W93ELK", "B001O0TWXG", "B003KZ27N0", "B00775R45A", "B000GPIPTM", "B002N5N4FS", "B0030Y11UG", "B000GETTKM", "B00HDU9UOW", "B002C11LCG", "B0000AQS81", "B00AIANIPQ", "B000KLQUMQ", "B000TM1CKQ", "B004XVMCH6", "B004MLEYUK"], "bought_together": ["B00008YGRV", "B000AQ68Z0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00008YGRV", "B00E0FW054", "B000HT3P6U", "B003L77G9W"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 28363}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 11.89, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B000083C6V", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N2CR5F9CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Family Guy, Volume One"}

{"description": "To quote New York movie critic Jay Sherman, voiced to Master Thespian perfection by Jon Lovitz, \"it stinks\" thatThe Criticlasted all but two seasons. \"I used to have a show on ABC,\" Sherman bitterly remarks at one point, \"for about a week.\" The show, created by Al Jean and Mike Reiss ofSimpsonslegend, fared no better when it moved to Fox, and little better when re-run on Comedy Central. But it did garner a devoted following, and thanks to DVD and the Internet, \"the last hope of fading stars\" (according to one of the ten \"Webisodes\" contained in this three-disc set), Jay Sherman lives! Television's saddest sack is the host of a TV review show,Coming Attractions. He must deal with the slings, arrows, and outrageous misfortunes heaped upon him by his ex-wife, adoptive WASP parents, and ratings-desperate Ted Turner-esque boss. On the movie front,The Criticis no less inside than the similarly ill-fatedAction, but its hilarious parodies of classics and contemporary blockbusters, from the musical \"Apocalypse Wow\" to \"Dennis the Menace II Society,\" make it much more accessible to any multiplex-goer.The Critictook particular glee in zinging Howard Stern, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Woody Allen and Soon-Yi. (We pause to praise the show's unsung heroes, Maurice Le Marche and Nick Jameson, who provide uncanny celebrity impersonations each episode). Some references have a longer shelf life than others. Conan O'Brien, at the time a fledgling talk-show host, certainly got the last laugh on a spied newspaper headline, \"Conan Replaced by Dancing Chicken.\" And the series' best episode, in which Jay reunites an estranged Roger Ebert and the late Gene Siskel, plays now as a touching tribute to the original Thumb and Thumber.The Criticis poised for discovery. Is it too much to hope that, as withFamily Guy, voluminous DVD sales may spark interest in creating new episodes?--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000ARXF7I", "B000ABKHZC", "B0019N8P2W", "B00LBHOCHS", "B000UX6TIY", "B00006IGVK", "B0007CILMA", "B000GIXLWA", "B000PAAJZG", "B001FT4PF6", "B0007CILMK", "B00069L0Z4", "B0002WZRTU", "B00097DY2U", "B0001MZ7K0", "B00AIANIPQ", "B00C7E3E7S", "B000FO0AG0", "B002WJHDJI", "B0000AQS89", "B00GOC74PC", "B000HWZ4LG", "B001AIQ15O", "B0014FAIWU", "B00L89VL96", "B000Q6775O", "B007QD0VOE", "B004MWLXTO", "B000EBGE9Q", "B000FS9MVK", "B00DOZNH58", "B001G0MFFG", "B0007Y08LA", "B00K8HAJN8", "B00AQ590IC", "B007KFZ7PG", "B000H7JCFK", "B001FT4PDI", "B007KFZ7Q0", "B00I2YXN5A", "B005OZJVE2", "B00I099JZK", "B002WJHDIO", "B000AABKGI", "B00466HOR6", "B004WO9OOS", "B0012680AI", "B0048LPRDC", "B000M7XRC4", "B000E6ES9O", "B000B8I9XQ", "B0012KSUTA", "B00GSSD73K", "B0002PYSB0", "B0000WN15E", "B000EMGIDC", "B005DCJ2TU", "B007KFZ7YM", "B007KFZ8AA", "B0002NY8XA", "B0069R250G", "B002GSXKRO", "B0024FAR52", "B001NOMO2Y", "B001GQ3GHG", "B007KFZ8AK", "B001J4E1C4", "B00L326LTI", "B007KFZ88M", "B00GUALJUO", "B0017INRG8", "B001PU8N12", "B0029WGIDK", "B003IJ72WY", "B0055SNHQ6", "B001LRL4XI", "B000NNK4DM", "B002GOAGYI", "B0002YCVY2", "B00BCMT1PK", "B00AUJH32E", "B0001MZ7KA", "B000ATQYVA", "B003L77G7Y", "B0017RFXJI", "B007I1Q544", "B00316DA9I", "B00K2CHVSK", "B0016KCCCM", "B0000797E5", "B001D2WUCK", "B007KFZ87S", "B000AXWX70", "B004VT9JLC", "B001RIZ7OI", "B00BTRKMNI"], "bought_together": ["B0019N8P2W", "B000ABKHZC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0019N8P2W", "B00AIANIPQ", "B00DOZNH58", "B000HWZ4LG"]}, "price": 12.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8351}, "asin": "B00008EY6Q", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514B8EE8A0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Critic - The Complete Series"}

{"description": "Depending on how you liked this romantic comedy, you just might find more laughs in the delightful banter between the director and his two stars on the commentary track. Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant join writer-director Marc Lawrence for a lively 102 minutes of conversation. Not much movie magic is discussed, but the three talents will sacrifice all for a good joke. It's best to watch the commentary track with the \"Two Bleeps Notice\" viewing option: when a heart appears on-screen, you can immediately view outtakes from that stage of the film. The flubs, on-set antics, and jokes are all guaranteed to bring a laugh. Other extras include two additional scenes (the wedding finale was judicially cut) and a HBO puff-piece on the making of the film. Yet the disc is a must-have for any fan of Bullock or Grant because it offers a chance to listen in on them; they're just as charming off-screen as on.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002K0WBXW", "6304765266", "B000023VTP", "B00005JPE3", "B000YDBPAM", "B00AEBB8NS", "B000HEWEE4", "0783235380", "B00003CXSM", "B0009OL7Z4", "B0000897EG", "B00AEBB8YW", "B0007PLLBU", "B0021L8UZS", "B00006ZXSO", "B00AEFY99O", "B0000AOV4I", "B004SIP9RO", "B004SIP8JI", "B00007E2F5", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B00008G7UF", "B00006ZXSQ", "B0038N9X3Q", "B001ECDVK4", "B00006FMUW", "B00005JPSM", "B002NZK5V4", "B002ZG989G", "B000MQC9H4", "B00066FB2A", "B000CEV3M8", "B00000JGHN", "B00005JN3W", "B00005JG6N", "B00005JL7Q", "B002SYAGNC", "B00004UEDQ", "B000CCBCAS", "B00081U7HC", "B0015I2RT8", "B00068GTK6", "B000NA1WE0", "B0006GANOQ", "B002ZG988M", "B00006ZXSN", "B00AEBB9WI", "B005XB8SRS", "6305213283", "B0045HCJJ4", "B002ZG9968", "B00E8RKHWW", "B004SEUJK0", "B00006ZXSL", "B000A343RI", "B00AKGG6JS", "B0006A9FIM", "B00005O5CM", "B00AEFXWXI", "6305236569", "B00008G6E8", "B00AEFXYOA", "B004EPZ070", "B002VECM6S", "B002P413IC", "B00AEFYWQY", "B000QGDY0G", "B003B3V0N4", "B0013D8LHC", "0780625277", "B003Y5H574", "B0000VD02Y", "0767811100", "B00164X59M", "6305736685", "B001AKTZW8", "B001WAKOW6", "B00EP2SN58", "B00EIBO8T6", "B000XJD33O", "B000BNX3B4", "B00006ZXSK", "B004SIP8LG", "B00005JM55", "0767821769", "B004SIP9VA", "B00AEFYSEA", "B0009KA2OA", "B001C5LLQ4", "B00164KYV4", "B002NZK5R8", "B002NZK5VO", "B002NZK5RS", "B000683VI4", "0800141660", "B0002Y121K", "B0071HPOGK", "B00AEFXKUI", "B00006ZXSI", "B003Y5H524"], "bought_together": ["B002K0WBXW", "6304765266"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002K0WBXW", "B004SIP9RO", "6304765266", "B000023VTP"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18204}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.56, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00008NRI7", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VJyiu%2ByUL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Two Weeks Notice (Full-Screen Edition) (Snap Case)"}

{"description": "Nineteen actors have portrayed Simon Templar, the gentleman adventurer created by Leslie Charteris in 1928. Among the most memorable incarnations were George Sanders (in a series of 1930s films) and Vincent Price (who voiced the character on radio in the 1940s). But for baby boomers, there is only one Simon: Roger Moore, who starred in this classic 1960s British TV series. Moore makes a better Templar than he did a Bond (and he is certainly better than Val Kilmer, who stared in the 1997 feature film), and the inside jokes include guest appearances by Lois Maxwell, best known to 007 fans as Miss Moneypenny.  Except for the gadgets,The Sainthas all the pleasures of the Bond films: a real international man of mystery impeccably dressed (these entertaining adventures are \"more cloak than dagger\"), exotic locations, cold war intrigue, sparkling bons mots, and beautiful (albeit chaste) women, and the highlight of any episode is the devilishly funny prologue, in which, no matter where he is, someone always identifies our hero as \"the infamous\" Simon Templar, prompting him to cast his eyes heavenward as he is crowned by his signature animated halo. This 14-disc set includes all 47 original color episodes presented in their U.S. broadcast order.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007D4MRC", "B0007D4MRM", "B0000DC14E", "B00029NKSS", "B0001Z35LU", "B000GUK3SS", "B00962R0H4", "B005HF4WMU", "B0006TPDQG", "B001NH4CEY", "B000BD1LKY", "B0007WFXUI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007D4MRC", "B0001Z35LU", "B00005ICEE", "B00E5G03I4"]}, "price": 8.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 295324}, "asin": "B00009M9DL", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51869KTM3WL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Saint Megaset"}

{"description": "When Neil Jordan is really on his game, as he is withThe Good Thief, his directorial skill is a marvel to behold. In the character-driven mode of Jordan'sMona LisaandThe Crying Game, this smooth, underrated caper provides an abundance of cinematic riches, not the least being Jordan's peerless knack for dialogue and a tailor-made role for Nick Nolte. For better or worse, Nolte's off-screen drug abuse served him well in portraying Bob Montagnet, ace thief, recovering heroin addict, and beloved denizen of the French Riviera, where his luck is about to take some very clever turns. The elegant plot is yours to discover: In loosely remaking the French classicBob le Flambeur, Jordan crafts what one reviewer aptly called \"the underbelly ofOcean's Eleven,\" involving an impenetrable vault full of priceless art, a rescued Russian prostitute, an eccentric band of accomplices, and high-stakes poker in Monte Carlo. Nolte's right at home in this rich-and-risky milieu, and the combined talents of Jordan and ace cinematographer Chris Menges makeThe Good Thiefa pleasure from start to finish.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005UQ9T", "B00004RFAJ", "B00HGBAG5K", "B00112S8RS", "B000BOH904", "B00D3LA5WG", "B000EHRVOM", "B00G7QPXUI", "B0009A40EI", "B00008K7AO", "B00D3DJIG8", "B00006L91I", "B004QDRW0S", "B0001EFV7C", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00AENNHOE", "B00GBT62PQ", "B0002V7O5Q", "B00AN10MK4", "B009AMAL4Y", "B00008KC4I", "B00005JNQA", "B007UW9W5U", "B00004W229", "B00008972P", "0767847415", "B00DX88HME", "B0000633SC", "B000062XE6", "B00006RCNV", "B00008PHCU", "B00005U2KC", "B0045HCIZE", "B00AEBB89W", "B00H9KKGTO", "B004SIP7VM", "B004C45AZU", "B000C65Z1G", "B00000F527", "B0003JAO7C", "B00097DY2A", "B00008YNHD", "B000JYW5AK", "B004MQ6W5K", "B00049QJ9I", "B0001BKACG", "B00005OLYF", "B0095YMNGG", "B00AQBDU4Q", "B000053VAX", "B00005QCVU", "B004XQO90O", "B00005NRN8", "B008220DGE", "B002VWNICC", "B002ZG98C8", "B00005JMJ4", "B000PAAJZ6", "B001RTP3YQ", "B009POCG0Y", "B007L6VRBM", "B000063US2", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B000069HZP", "B00166UFTS", "B00AEFYSEA", "B00005JNC2", "6305657947", "B00B1E6FF8", "1572525983", "B000059PPK", "B000TXNDSO", "B000MG2LOA", "B00007M5HI", "B00026L754"], "bought_together": ["B00005UQ9T"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0385337469", "B00008KC4I"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 158740}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.21, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B00009WVT3", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P4Q33DNFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Good Thief"}

{"description": "Marking an assured directorial debut for actor John Malkovich,The Dancer Upstairsis a tense, nerve-jangling political thriller that values adult storytelling and emotional depth over cheap thrills. It's a challenge for those accustomed to the frantic pace of Hollywood thrillers, but attentive viewers will be richly rewarded by Malkovich's slow-burn approach to the film's terrorist plot, adapted by Nicholas Shakespeare from his ownnovel, based on the \"Shining Path\" movement that terrorized Peru in the 1980s. The plot unfolds in an unnamed Latin American capital, where a lawyer-turned-police detective named Rejas (Javier Bardem) leads an investigation to locate Ezequiel, a terrorist whose followers have left a trail of fear, death and destruction across the city. Rejas falls in love with his daughter's ballet teacher (Laura Morante), but the film's ultimate revelation--a coincidence that Malkovich handles with credible delicacy--throws this simmering drama into stark relief, bringing Bardem's character (and his subtle performance) to a greater awareness of his own personal and political humanity.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0011FLH14", "B00116GEJ8", "B00003CXRG", "B00080Z53O", "B0041KKYF6", "B001DN0UY4", "B0036TGSJE", "B004MOJW0E", "B001DJ7PR8", "B000K2V7F0", "B008YYSD3U", "B000088UZ4", "B00005LZOD", "B000N3T0DW", "B00AZMFKXK", "B000GUJYH4", "0385721072", "B0001DCYMI", "B00005N8A9", "B00005JLQW", "B00008AOX5", "B003Z8ZC2A", "B009B8YMB0", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005JNCZ", "B00001ODHV", "B004XVMCMG", "B000CCD1RA", "B002VECLXC", "B0007NBJHI", "B00005JL57", "B000274TLW", "B002FHGESI", "B008FYZHHE", "B0002TT0MI", "B00018D40O", "B0006Z2NKO", "B001UV4XRY", "B000PISZ7W", "B004AE3QYE", "B00000F7E6", "B00006G8G3", "B00000K3TU", "B000F7CMRM", "0140157654", "B0007OCG5G", "B000C3L2PC", "B00HRISNPM", "B004YCKKH8", "B00008L3S6", "B006DHATE6", "B0030Y1282", "B002SF9YNY", "B003Z8ZC0M", "B002I5GNZQ", "B00006L91I", "B000J3OTOG", "B0000A2ZTY", "B008XAT0U0", "B00004Z1FK", "B00HEEAMCG", "B000Y54UUC", "B000N6TX1I", "B002T4GXUG", "B002DU39GW", "B001LRJH0U", "B0081HLM2E", "B0013XZ2QK", "B002LVVCJY", "B00AQBDU4Q", "B002ZG993Q", "B00005JL6M", "B001WLMOL4", "B008FYZJ2C", "B0000AMU29", "B0016LFG3S", "B004ZJZQ92", "B00AEFXRWO", "B00AEFY8MM", "B001FB5634", "B0000TPAH4", "B002EOVWVQ", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B000E5KURY", "B002M2T1VI", "B005CFBZ3O", "B000O76ZQC", "B0043X1FNQ", "B00GPPXNIK", "B000CCW2O8", "B001N44BVQ", "B004CIIXDC", "B00008L3TF", "B001URA5Y8", "B00003CXXY", "B0016MJ6HY", "B000G0O5IM", "B004SIP6BI", "B000QGE84M"], "bought_together": ["B0011FLH14"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0011FLH14", "B00003CXRG", "B004XVMCMG", "B001DJ7PR8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 85585}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.79, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B0000AGQ5V", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4173C4VBCSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Dancer Upstairs"}

The decade-shaping interviewees include Martin Scorsese, Robert Altman, Francis Coppola, et al. The film's argument has actually been conventional wisdom for at least 10 years, but it's well-supported by an abundance of clips, which should inspire even hardcore film buffs to seek out rarities such asThunderbolt and LightfootorThe King of Marvin Gardens.

{"description": "Season 4 began on a high point with the Centauri Prime in the grip of the insane Emperor Cartagia (Wortham Krimmer) and a run of six shows leading to the climax of the war against the Shadows in \"Into the Fire.\" If this colossal narrative was resolved a little too easily and the ultimate aim of the Shadows turned out to be a tad disappointing, it still proved to be the most powerful slice of space opera to ever grace the small screen. In the aftermath the sheer scale dropped back a little but the pace never slowed as the rest of the season played out in one relentless cycle of conspiracy, betrayal and conflict,Babylon 5siding with the rebel Mars colony against the totalitarian Earth.Meanwhile Delenn came increasingly into conflict with her own people and, paralleling her relationship with Sheridan, Garibaldi became involved with his ex-fianc&#xE9;e Lise Hampton (Denise Gentile), while an intense platonic love grew between Ivanova and Marcus Cole. On an unstoppable wave fuelled by roller-coaster plot twists and spectacular action shows from \"No Surrender, No Retreat\"--when Sheridan avows to overthrow EarthGov--to \"Rising Star\"--when the aim is realized--Babylon 5achieved a consistent excellence rare in television. Yet within that run \"Intersections in Real Time\" stood out as a bold experiment; essentially a two-hand drama taking place entirely within one dimly lit room. Beyond this a major character died and Sheridan and Delenn married before the season finale again broke with expectation. In \"The Deconstruction of Falling Stars,\" a future descendant of humanity one million years hence reviews excerpts from the history ofBabylon 5. In one sequence set in 2762, a Brother is devoted to the preserving of history some time after the \"Big Burn.\" A homage to Walter M.

{"description": "Based on an idea by Gene Roddenberry,Andromedaconfidently wears its debt toStar Trekon its sleeve, recalling the best sci-fi of Roddenberry's heyday. The two-part premiere \"Under the Night\" and \"An Affirming Flame\" make for a terrific introduction to the lead character, Captain Dylan Hunt, played by Kevin (ex-Hercules) Sorbo. He's a sympathetically flawed idealist in command of theAndromeda Ascendant, a massive starship of the now-disbanded Systems Commonwealth. The fall of civilization has meant that although she ought to be a relic she remains the zenith of technological advancement.In the series opener we see Captain Hunt in battle against 10,000 enemy ships, winning a bout of fisticuffs with a close friend turned enemy traitor, wrestling with the shock of being frozen in time for 300 years and then diplomatically negotiating his way out of a salvage rights battle for his ship. TheAndromeda Ascendant's emotionally driven, life-like computer is desired by theEureka Marusalvage vessel, and feisty Captain Beka Valentine can barely stop her engineer Harper from drooling about tinkering with her. TheMaru's shipmates are similarly driven: Rev Bem (from another sworn enemy race) has a spiritual calling, while cutesy-pie Trance Gemini's motivations are part of her winning mysteriousness. One final addition is the show's muscle, Tyr, the enemy with a conscience who would later get the spotlight in such episodes as \"All Neptune's Great Oceans\" and \"Music of a Distant Drum.\"\"The Pearls That Were His Eyes\" was one of the first conceived episode ideas, but was delayed until the availability of aStar Trekregular. That eventually turned out to be John (Q) de Lancie, who gives a brilliant turn as Beka's long-lost Uncle Sid.  \"Star-Crossed\" is the first-season episode that caused more gossip than any other.Stargateregular Michael Shanks guest stars, falls in love with Rommie on screen (and with Lexa Doig off screen), and then suddenly quitsSG-1. There's certainly a spark between them in the show to support the gossip. The secondary cause for talk was its broadcast rescheduling in sympathy with the events of September 11 since it opens with a terrorist attack. Criticized by some for its extreme violence, the season finale \"Its Hour Come 'Round at Last\" will stay with you one way or another. Maybe for the sight of an alternate Rommie turning uncharacteristically nasty to everyone and seriously kicking butt. Or maybe the mind-blowing Magog Worldship, made up of 20 planets and their sun. Or maybe just the seemingly impossible scenario each major character is faced with as the show ends.--Paul Tonks", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003ZFC9M4", "B0042YZFYG", "B0048FUUAI", "B004HYW84G", "B001RHGRTS", "B0009JE6FM", "B0006VXLLI", "B00F3L8P26", "B003Y7JWZ0", "B002BAW6FE", "B000JLTRHW", "B000BCCAEQ", "B00061QJSK", "B002BAW6GS", "B002BAW6FY", "B003H9LIU2", "B0009HI5KQ", "B006LG74RE", "B002BAW6GI", "0783225741", "B00404ME2E", "B00AMDA2P8", "B0041OOSMC", "B00344EAKA", "B00466H3CC", "B004EXWGHY", "B002BAW6H2", "B0006FO9B0", "B000ELL1QC", "B002VA59ZS", "B0041B77RS", "B000A6CLL0", "B0006GAOP4", "B00L4K3MLE", "B00E3QJ7JC", "B0009JE6G6", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B00K7IPFSM", "B002VA5A02", "B009P3J69O", "B0007TKH66", "B000F8O2Q0", "B00376AVHQ", "B00AMDA2QC", "B00IWTVDUW", "B0009I7NGW", "B006LG74Q0", "B002CLKP00", "B007AFC0W4", "B00466H3CW", "B003BV8I7C", "B000CEXFYW", "B000E33VZY", "B0044ZTWRY", "B000BNI90Y", "B0049H6RWK", "B00453QOC6", "B003NH3X5Q", "B00006CXFV", "B001DW2BG0", "B000FIHN8O", "B000WTZ6SK", "B00008KA57", "B0001NBNFW", "B004TJ1H3C", "B00062IDCO", "B00243FQFA", "B00076ONT6", "B00JK47BHM", "B000AJJNFE", "B000F8O2OM", "B005GYXO30", "B006LPHY6G", "B00B2203PM", "B0057FGD3Q", "B001HUWQEA", "B001DF681G", "B000V5EYXS", "B009DE6HW4", "B00062IDLA", "B002U0KHME", "B000B8IA2G", "B000F8O2PQ", "B0002WZTCA", "B000F8O2OW", "B0017MO10U", "B0017MO11O", "B000BR9SA0", "B002ZCY872", "B000F8O2P6", "B00344EAQO", "B0000CABIJ", "B000AOEMXC", "B00466H3A4", "B000HEZEY6", "B000TJBNHQ", "B00008G8P2", "0306820366", "B00CDEJRDC", "B000228EBS"], "bought_together": ["B003ZFC9M4", "B0042YZFYG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B006P2TA44", "B004HYW84G", "B003ZFC9M4", "B0048FUUAI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 189276}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 89.99, "brand": "ADV Films", "asin": "B0000DIZR6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TYBD7066L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Andromeda - Season 1 Collection"}
{"description": "If you're not a Tenacious D fan already,The Complete Master Worksmight make you an instant convert (or scare you away; it all depends). One thing's for sure: If you thought \"the D\" were nothing more than a novelty act, this two-disc feast will set you straight, proving that classically trained guitarist Kyle Gass and fast-rising comedy star Jack Black (School of Rock) are a bona fide acoustic power duo, scorching the pop-cultural landscape with their satirically scathing lyrics while qualifying as legitimate musicians with awesome chops and just enough insanity to make them dangerous on stage. Disc 1 (\"For Fans\") is all meat and potatoes, consisting of a brilliant concert (taped at London's Brixton Academy, November 3, 2002) in which Black casts himself as an abrasive provocateur, daring to offend \"KG\" and the audience alike with barbed taunts and spiteful attitude (all faked, of course, but convincing enough to sucker the gullible). The musicianship is first-rate, and Black's vocals remarkably spry, a deft combination of rapid-fire scatting and heavy-metal worship. The HBO episodes chronicle TD's early years as their popularity was still mostly an L.A.-based phenomenon, and without exception they're wet-your-pants hilarious.Disc 2 is aptly dubbed \"For Psycho Fans,\" offering a potpourri of TD ephemera for true devotees, including three HBO short films that are gross enough (and funny enough) to make any Farrelly Brothers comedy look positively tame by comparison (in other words, this definitely isn't kid's stuff). The TV appearances are somewhat redundant with the concert material, and the \"On the Road\" video diaries are perfunctory but fun. The best is saved for last: two music videos paired with \"making-of\" featurettes, including Spike Jonze's fantasy-oriented video for \"Wonderboy,\" and a devilishly adult-oriented video for \"FHG\" (salacious \"D\" fans know whatthatmeans) from the animators ofRen & Stimpy. If you're offended, don't blame \"Kage\" and \"Jables\"--their Tenacious DVD has \"Parental Advisory\" clearly stamped on its cover, and prudes are well-advised to stay away.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001G5IK32", "B000MCH5RM", "B007YLEM3Y", "B007D7H6IW", "B000IOM1RI", "B001G5IK3C", "B000K6B4E0", "B000OT8PAE", "B001GKWDTY", "B00135TTRQ", "B00L326LTI", "B0017RFY56", "B00AEBBA2M", "157560812X", "B000F1IO3O", "B00IACUO8S", "B001053088", "B000001Y5P", "0486437507", "B005S19BHO", "B002HK9IOU", "B0004Z33FK", "B000CQQID0", "B000LC52DC", "B0000DZEE3", "B007I1Q544", "B00009W8JZ", "B00274SITW", "1926778642", "B002KLAL88", "B005OTGS6C", "B00005Y3ZL", "B001CDFY4Q", "B00INLE5K4", "B001CDFY7S", "B000P2A6CA", "B0002WZRSG", "B00AEFYSL8", "B000H6SY32", "B000005ENT", "B000LPR9ZI", "B000KJU1MS", "B000ZOT8FO", "B001E95ZHY", "B000OT5M14", "B00AU15GLC", "B00113YHXG", "B0002ERXBS", "B003L77GLU", "B004TSDWMM", "B004NNV5MM", "B000BNTM96", "B00006CXI1", "B000F6II1M", "B0083XXWRE", "B006KCZBK6", "B003L7DK74", "B000ARXF7I", "B00F3TD8QQ", "B001NY4WLA", "B007ZFR67I", "B00BC56IB2", "B000FMH8RG", "B00009V7T2", "B0048LPRDC", "078401213X", "B00094ARHS", "B0014DBZXS", "B002OOWKSU", "B0001I9Y8U", "B001T21R5U", "6305840083", "0783227434", "B000GG4Y2S", "B0002V7TMY", "B0000DC13R", "B00007B4E6", "B003EYVXSW", "B0035LCV12", "6305594333", "B0013LPS8E", "B006H3KQWG", "B000093FLA", "B00267N3EU", "B007J3ISIM", "B000A7DVR2", "B0007UC8Y4", "B00000G02H", "B005JLN9Z8", "1401238629", "B001CQONK4", "B002MTTZ5I", "B0007RO8MW", "B001H9N870", "B00BPEJX12", "B006CR2OD6", "B001CK1D44", "B0054QHHHE", "B000001FTD", "6305428239"], "bought_together": ["B001G5IK32", "B000MCH5RM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000MCH5RM", "B007YLEM3Y", "B000IOM1RI", "B007D7H6IW"]}, "price": 13.98, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Comedy & Spoken Word", "Comedic Music"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 35002}, "asin": "B0000E2FLB", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EJY4YVCSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tenacious D - The Complete Master Works"}
{"description": "TheAlien Quadrilogyis a nine-disc boxed set devoted to the fourAlienfilms. Although previously available on DVD as theAlien Legacy, here they have been repackaged with vastly more extras and with upgraded sound and picture. For anyone who hasn't been in hypersleep for the last 25 years, this series needs no introduction, though for the first time each film now comes in both original and \"special edition\" form.Alien(1979) was so perfect it didn't need fixing, and Ridley Scott's 2003 director's cut is fiddling for the sake of fiddling. Watch it once, then return to the majestic, perfectly paced original. Conversely, the special edition of James Cameron'sAliens(1986) is the definitive version, though it's nice to finally have the theatrical cut on DVD for comparison. Most interesting is the alternativeAlien 3(1992). This isn't a \"director's cut\"--David Fincher refused to have any involvement with this release--but a 1991 work-print that runs 29 minutes longer than the theatrical version, and has now been restored, remastered, and finished off with (unfortunately) cheap new CGI. Still, it's truly fascinating, offering a different insight into a flawed masterpiece. The expanded opening is visually breathtaking, the central firestorm is much longer, and a subplot involving Paul McGann's character adds considerable depth to story. The ending is also subtly but significantly different.Alien: Resurrection(1997) always was a mess with a handful of brilliant scenes, and the special edition just makes it eight minutes longer.TheAlien Quadrilogyoffers the first and fourth films with DTS soundtracks, the others having still fine Dolby Digital 5.1 presentation. All four films sound fantastic, with much low-level detail revealed for the first time. Each is anamorphically enhanced at the correct original aspect ratio, and the prints and transfers are superlative. Every film offers a commentary track that lends insight into the creative process--though the Scott-only commentary and isolated music score from the firstAlienDVD release are missing here.Each movie is complemented by a separate disc packed with hours of seriously detailed documentaries (all presented in full-screen with clips letterboxed), thousands of photos, production stills, and storyboards, giving a level of inside information for the dedicated buff only surpassed by theLord of the Ringsextended DVD sets. A ninth DVD compiles miscellaneous material, including an hourlong documentary and even all the extras from the oldAlienlaserdisc. \"Exhaustive\" hardly beings to describe theAlien Quadrilogy, a set that establishes the new DVD benchmark for retrospective releases and looks unlikely to be surpassed for some time.--Gary S.

The star this time is John Malkovich, whose older Tom Ripley has settled into an Italian villa and a life of aesthetic contemplation (a little like Hannibal Lecter inHannibal). A former partner (Ray Winstone) drags an innocent frame-maker (Dougray Scott), dying of leukemia, into the role of unexpected hit man. Ripley, for his own enigmatic reasons, helps. Liliana Cavani, ofThe Night Porternotoriety, directed this handsome if nebulous film (which has no connection to theMatt Damon picture, other than a Patricia Highsmithsource novel). Malkovich exudes his usual oily disenchantment with the world; Lena Headey, like the location footage, is gorgeous.

{"description": "In the investigative tradition of master illusionist and early 20th-century ghostbuster Harry Houdini, magicians Penn Jillette and partner Teller debunk the paranormal in their wildly entertaining Showtime series,Penn & Teller: Bullsh*t!. The first season of this unusual show finds the garrulous Penn and silent Teller taking aim, over 13 episodes, at such perennial hokum as \"Talking to the Dead,\" \"ESP,\" and \"Ouija Boards.\" But they also go after a couple of contemporary, exploitation-driven industries they believe con vulnerable people in the same way phony mediums rip off the bereaved and \"regression therapists\" lead on would-be alien abductees.One of these industries is the network of charlatans promising sexual enhancement through bigger breasts or male genitals; the other is the publishing world's raging river of self-help books. But our boys don't stop there. Just to make sure each viewer comes away impeached at least once for championing a sacred cow, Penn and Teller take on creationists, anti-smokers, vegetarians, extreme environmentalists, and feng shui enthusiasts. Everyone is bound to feel a little offended at some point in this boxed set's 360 minutes, but P&T; offset their indignation with wily humor and the occasional, dazzling trick.\"Talking to the Dead\" doesn't dwell on Houdini's penchant for exposing the fakery behind old-fashioned seances. But it does attack today's celebrity mediums, especially the Sci-Fi Channel's John Edward, whose off-screen methods for gathering useful, private information about his audiences are revealed. \"Alien Abductions\" seeks reasons behind claims of extraterrestrial probing of human orifices, but saves most of Penn and Teller's wrath for those who profit from others' delusions. \"Near Death Experiences\" challenges assumptions about glimpsing the afterlife, and \"Alternative Medicine\" weighs in on the ever-sensitive subject of non-medicinal remedies for illness.The most fun episode, by far, is \"Sex, Sex, Sex,\" which is adorned by a lot of beautiful, naked men and women milling about while Penn and Teller chase down sundry hucksters, including a hypnotherapist who claims she can enlarge naughty bits through subconscious suggestion. This engrossing, three-disc set is rounded out by a number of delightful special features, including entertaining outtakes and a bonus \"Ghost Segment.\"--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006FO5IC", "B000GTJSLW", "B000K7UBZ2", "B0014FAIUC", "B004OWQTRI", "B001S86J0S", "B0037TPIDK", "B000CRR3B0", "B0006FO5IM", "1451610378", "145161036X", "B004OWQTS2", "B000XV55YW", "B000GTJSMQ", "B0014FAIUW", "0399161562", "B000C3L2NE", "B00K0MM4AM", "B001S86J12", "B003156IKM", "0679743111", "B001MFNB5I", "B000A59POW", "B00IWULSTC", "B004OWQTPU", "B00J8LXD56", "B0000E2PVR", "B00BPEJX12", "B000F48D14", "B0000ZMH8S", "0394753518", "1939578094", "B004SIPA4G", "B00C8CQTJY", "B00BN3DZZA", "B0001MZ7KA", "B00F4NPBI4", "B00D7OMNXS", "B000Q7ZOAI", "B0058YPMHO", "B004L3AQLU", "B003L77G3I", "B0025VKX04", "B0087MN9HO", "B008JFUO0Y", "B0037TPICG"], "bought_together": ["B0006FO5IC", "B000GTJSLW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004OWQTPU", "B0006FO5IC", "B000GTJSLW", "B000CRR3B0"]}, "price": 28.78, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 64186}, "asin": "B00019PDNY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NMYHH2VFL._SX300_.jpg", "title": "Penn &amp; Teller - Bullsh*t! - The First Season"}
{"description": "Playmakersgrows on a viewer in the most important way a good television series should: by encouraging curiosity about the growth and fate of key characters. One might easily dismiss this ESPN original drama as a mere catalog of the problems that dog some professional football players, very often to public scrutiny: injuries, drugs, egos, criminal associations, etc. But patience rewards those who watch enough ofPlaymakers's 11 episodes to care about the humanity of the show's troubled athletes. The series concerns NFL contenders the Cougars, led by a hard but fair coach (Anthony John Denison) suffering from prostate cancer while dealing with a treacherous team owner (Bruce Gray), a problematic prima donna (Omar Gooding), and mid-ranked players struggling with fundamentals of the game.Meanwhile, several Cougars emerge as major characters, among them middle linebacker Eric Olczyk (Jason Matthew Smith), a good guy psychologically impaired after paralyzing an opposing player and now trying to get both his game and life back. Olczyk's best friend, running back Leon Taylor (Russell Hornsby), is at the end of his contract and faces stiff competition for his job, causing stress that translates into a reputation-destroying act of domestic violence. Star quarterback Derek McConnell, a hound among hounds, impregnates a stranger and compels a team assistant (Stephen Bogaert) to handle abortion details. Time after time, the men ofPlaymakersfind themselves pressured to live and function with an eye toward the team's good image and commercial prospects. Yet clean living is terribly difficult given the physical sacrifices, emotional isolation, management sabotage, and temptations foisted upon pro players. The many dramatic strings drawn out over the series come together in the very fine final episode, ending on a note of irony as outrageous as anything previously seen on television.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007US7BW", "B000JBXP20", "B000BFJM5S", "B000R7HY46", "6305428492", "B000FVR1T2", "B002NZK5QO", "B001B187BQ", "B002VKB0NI", "B0010YSD90", "B000FOPPBA", "B00021R7E4", "B0006H32DO", "B000RF1QE2", "B00006FDBV", "B008B4KVRE", "B000A2XAQ4", "0375725067", "B0002IQGRG", "B000O77SOK", "B0039YAL80", "B0009GV9E6", "B009XC8RNI", "B00DBPBP8C", "B00005Y6YJ", "B004HFRZ4S", "B000N3T0EG", "B00553K9IA", "B00007BK2Q", "B00AEFXJY0", "B005SQRYEG", "B00DSQ40R2", "B00AEBB8SS", "B00000FBH2", "B009DA74O8", "B00004U103", "B0067QPVD2", "B00AY1CT3G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000JBXP20", "B000BFJM5S", "B00008WJBD", "B000R7HY46"]}, "price": 21.08, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 87407}, "asin": "B0001A79GM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MNRRRC34L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Playmakers - The Complete Series"}
{"description": "Cue the Henry Mancini music and watch out for Cato--the gist of thePink Pantherseries has been gathered in a six-disc boxed set. At the center of it is Peter Sellers's incarnation of inspector Jacques Clouseau, a hopelessly bumbling detective with a genius for resting his hands in the wrong place (on the surface of a spinning globe, for instance) and mangling the English language.Writer-director Blake Edwards cast Peter Ustinov as Clouseau inThe Pink Panther, but Ustinov dropped out just before shooting began. Edwards (who recounts this story in a spotty commentary track included here) and Sellers bonded over their affection for Laurel and Hardy, and immediately transformed the character of Clouseau into a walking sight gag. The first film has a delicious swinging sixties vibe, while jewel thief David Niven, Claudia Cardinale, and Capucine occupy as much screen time as Sellers. Sellers really hits his stride inA Shot in the Dark, an elegantly funny tale of Clouseau sleuthing out a murder investigation. This one introduced Herbert Lom, as the increasingly frazzled Inspector Dreyfus, and Burt Kwouk, as Clouseau's houseboy-nemesis Cato. Sellers and Edwards, whose relationship was stormy, put Clouseau aside for over 10 years, until a trilogy of mid-1970s comedies restored the character to commercial (and dare we say cultural) primacy.Unfortunately, the very funny comeback picture,Return of the Pink Panther, is absent from this set due to rights issues with the studios involved.The Pink Panther Strikes Againhas Dreyfus going bananas and targeting Clouseau;Revenge of the Pink Pantherputs Clouseau in a hilarious series of disguises, climaxing in a wonderfully mounted sequence in Hong Kong. (Throughout the series, the calm, classical staging of gags by Blake Edwards reminds you of what a lost art this has become.)Trail of the Pink Pantherlooks better now than it did when originally released in 1982, shortly after Sellers's death; it's a batch of unused Sellers routines from previous pictures, strung together with a loose plot. In other words, it's a \"deleted scenes\" extra, and quite funny at times.Subsequent effortsCurse of the Pink PantherandSon of the Pink Pantherare neither included nor mentioned. A half-hour documentary gives pleasant memories from Edwards, but feels incomplete. The cartoon Panther gets his own 11-minute mini-doc, plus six cartoon shorts including the Oscar-winning \"The Pink Phink.\"--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009IW8OE", "B001IHJ988", "B001LXIDUY", "B0009S4J2I", "B001HUWQGS", "B00260HH1M", "B0009S4J4G", "B00005JKH9", "B003NTUOGU", "B000055Y0X", "B000FBH3V8", "B00009MEKJ", "B000CCBCDK", "B00005RDRO", "B0001Y9YJ8", "B00005JL0I", "B0016LFG5Q", "B001LXIDUO", "B0007R4SX6", "B000MQ54M6", "B000CEXFBK", "B001NPD9R2", "B000MEYKC8", "B0009S4J3C", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B000CNFC4E", "B000NDEXPM", "B0009S4J32", "B002TSAAME", "B0001F0WM0", "B000CEXFC4", "B000056NN6", "B00008438W", "B001IHJ974", "B0009S4J50", "B0009S4J4Q", "B0007ZEOCS", "B0009S4J2S", "B00014NEX0", "B0006IIPK8", "B0007XBKP4", "B00K2CHVSK", "B0000AUHPB", "B002HK9IDQ", "B00AEBB97S", "B0000CBY1C", "B0089TQ7AG", "B0007TKNM4", "B003DUBAX0", "B002HR456E", "B000G6BLWE", "B00005NSXY", "B001PK47H6", "B0058O1FES", "B00016MSV2", "B00132D7XQ", "B00000CQJZ", "B000G26YAW", "B000FO0A9W", "B00871C09S", "B000RPCK1U", "6305308748", "B00AEFYVUQ", "B008M4C1BC", "B005NFJAQC", "B0082LUGPI", "B00006ADD5", "B000244EWO", "B00AEFXDO6", "B0014BQQYS", "B002VWNIAY", "B00006JU7S", "B007N31YH0", "B003ZEQMH8", "B00009IB1F", "B001666484", "B00E8AVN9U", "B00005V5NS", "B00AEBBA9U", "B00000I5Y6", "B00066FBQG", "B001KZOVJK", "B00K7IPGS6", "B003UN2I4K", "B0009RCPY8", "076780676X", "B001RTKKNA", "B0009UZG3C", "B000P296AS", "B000E6ESI0", "B000FFJYAM", "B0000AGWJ3"], "bought_together": ["B0009IW8OE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0009IW8OE", "B0009S4J3C", "B000CEXFC4", "6305308748"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 24047}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 70.95, "brand": "MGM", "asin": "B0001AG01M", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/416EFSMVDPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Pink Panther Film Collection (The Pink Panther / A Shot in the Dark / Strikes Again / Revenge of / Trail of the Pink Panther)"}
{"description": "When orphaned shop clerk Arthur Kipps inherits a fortune, his future seems assured--but money doesn't buy happiness, as the gawky lad learns when he mixes with the swells. The splashy musicalHalf a Sixpencewas adapted from H.G. Wells's novel,Kipps, and it saw considerable success as astage vehiclefor the exuberant Tommy Steele. The film version gets caught in that mid-1960s mode of the lumbering super-production (the kind that helped kill the movie musical). Lavishly mounted by old pro director George Sidney, and boasting some echt-sixties photography by the great Geoffrey Unsworth,Half a Sixpenceoffers its share of eye candy. The blowhard presence of Cyril Ritchard and the spectacular dancing of Grover Dale help. Then there's Tommy Steele, whose stage-scaled performance is all teeth and hair; he attacks the razzmatazz numbers with ferocity--maybe more ferocity than charm.

{"description": "As upscale sitcoms go,Something's Gotta Givehas more to offer than most romantic comedies. Obviously working through some semi-autobiographical issues regarding \"women of a certain age,\" writer-director Nancy Meyers brings adequate credibility and above-average intelligence to what is essentially (but not exclusively) a fantasy premise, in which an aging lothario who's always dated younger women (Jack Nicholson, more or less playing himself) falls for a successful middle-aged playwright (Diane Keaton) who's convinced she's past the age of romance, much less sexual re-awakening. As long as old pals Nicholson and Keaton are on screen discussing their dilemma or discovering their mutual desire,Something's Gotta Giveis terrific, proving (in case anyone had forgotten) that Hollywood can and should aim for an older demographic. Myers falls short with the sitcom device of a younger lover (Keanu Reeves) who wants Keaton as much as Nicholson does; it's believable but shallow and too easily dismissed. Myers also skimps on supporting roles for Frances McDormand, Amanda Peet, and Jon Favreau, but thankfully this is one romantic comedy that doesn't pander to youth.

{"description": "Somebody smart produced the director's commentary track forBig  Fish; they brought in an interviewer to keep Tim Burton on track, thus  avoiding those moments when a director gapes silently at his movie,  grasping for some fresh thought. This sense of control, however, fosters a  somewhat corporate atmosphere, which also infests the typically fatuous  featurettes about \"The Character's Journey\" and \"The Filmmakers' Path.\"  Which is not to say they're a waste: Ewan McGregor is simply the most  charming man in the world; the various beasties in the movie are  technically interesting; and there's an interesting bit about the author  of the book and the screenwriter, usually two of the most ignored figures  in cinema. There's also a mildly diverting trivia quiz about Tim Burton's  earlier movies.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["1616201649", "B0000YTP02", "B00AEBBAEK", "B0000AC8LI", "B002UOMH00", "B0000VD04M", "B00AEBBA72", "B001AGXEAG", "B001ECDVKE", "B00A8KJK7G", "B000077VR3", "B00H3UKZ6E", "B001HN694K", "B008QE9XD2", "B000K7VHQE", "B0079K4WEE", "1565122178", "B000BB1MI2", "B004A8ZWV0", "B0001ADAVK", "B00005V9HH", "B002ZG980U", "B00447L4JG", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JKIS", "B00006LPGP", "B00003CXRM", "B00005JLSB", "B000P0J06U", "B004SIP7PS", "B00AEFY0F2", "B0006FYOTC", "B000E6ESL2", "B000P0J06K", "B00006JDU8", "B001CK1D44", "B0036TGSR6", "B005LAIIHG", "B00005JMJG", "B000LC55F2", "B00008G8M5", "B0010X73ZG", "B000RJO578", "B000P0J0BK", "B001J9KJ4I", "6305212112", "B00128VA76", "B004U7MR14", "B000C3L27U", "B000F8DBDK", "B00004WG2F", "B001OST0M6", "B000089778", "B00006JMSM", "B0009IOR5M", "B0000AK7AA", "B00005JKJJ", "B00003CXC3", "B003UAKE9Y", "B002VWNIEA", "B0006UEVT0", "B000NO39FG", "B00005NB8K", "B0000640VJ", "B001QOGYBI", "B000O76ZQC", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B000O76T72", "B004SIP92O", "B00008L3U1", "B005I0DV4Y", "B003L20IJM", "0767836324", "B004SEUIXS", "B001HN69AY", "B000A7DVR2", "B00003CXIP", "B000053VAZ", "B001KVZ6FW", "B000P0J0EW", "B000J4P9P8", "B001E1HCRI", "B00003CXZ4", "B0000VD02Y", "B000N6U0E2", "B00AEBB9K0", "B0001XALGY", "B00004Y87O", "B004SIP8W0", "B002GIBVV6", "B004EPYZU8", "B005LAIHYU", "B004SIP6BI", "B0010X8NF0", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000LXH0AE", "B00AEBB9SM", "B00009W5CA", "B002NZK5V4"], "bought_together": ["B0000YTP02"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000YTP02", "1616201649", "B00E8RKHWW", "B00CWM58WY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3909}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.98, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0001GOH6Q", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BHMMY1RSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Big Fish"}
{"description": "Felicity: Junior Year Collectionis an improvement overyear 2--perhaps inevitably, as the characters are lurching toward adulthood more rapidly and definitively. For the most part, Felicity (Keri Russell) and the gang still face the same challenges--commitment, academic momentum, conflicts over values, pressure from parents--but the stakes are higher because everyone has outgrown adolescent defenses and revealed more of themselves to lovers and friends. The third season begins with lots of smiles and hopes as Felicity, boyfriend Ben (Scott Speedman), would-be filmmaker Sean (Greg Grunberg), kinky Wiccan Meghan (Amanda Foreman), and the rest return from a summer break to get reacquainted. Felicity, expected to move in with pals Julie (Amy Jo Johnson) and Elena (Tangi Miller), impulsively decides to move into an apartment with Ben instead--without telling Ben. The funky hovel becomes a source of conflict (even more after Ben lets a beautiful neighbor take a bath in his and Felicity's living-room tub) that exacerbates the couple's ambivalence about one another.But a lot of things do that, including a visit from Felicity's mom (Eve Gordon) that finds the latter lobbying against Ben (who hasn't chosen a career and gets into a couple of fights this season) and for Noel (Scott Foley, whose character seems destined for success and who remains, secretly, in love with Felicity). Meanwhile, Sean and Meghan deal with the former's possible testicular cancer, Elena grapples with her virgin boyfriend's insistence on no pre-marital sex, Julie disappears while depressed over her relationship with her father, and newcomer Molly (Sarah-Jane Potts) tries to break off a relationship with a gun-toting drug addict (Robert Patrick Benedict). Typically, season 3 has frequent, jaw-dropping dramatic highlights, including a shooting that results in a profound experience for nearly everyone, an episode in which Felicity wakes up naked in a fraternity house, and another in which she is the recipient of an awkward pass by Ben's alcoholic father (John Ritter). Life is never dull in this series executive-produced by Ron Howard and Brian Grazer, and the subject of growing up, when treated with as much insight asFelicityoffers, is always interesting. Among the special features is a great parody of the series fromMad TV.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00BGQ2NDO", "B0077PTWHI", "B0077PTWY6", "B0006J28DM", "B0001IN0T4", "B005CGI3ZG", "B00127RAGM", "B004GJYRFA", "B000TGURZ8", "B00369ERC4", "B000BNXD6O", "B000LXH3SI", "B003INBNV6", "B000FUTVPA", "B001UHOWYM", "B002KQ6UE2", "B001ULCY48", "B00BMKGZVA", "B00000IP8T", "B003R0MF6W", "B001DZOCVO", "B001VPJYZU", "B000U1ZV2G", "B008L0YMWS", "B00000FZC1", "B003F3NE7K", "B0077PTX0E", "B0018CWEVW", "B000P6YNT8", "B003L77G56", "B0001EQHXO", "B000R7HRRA", "B002KQ6UDS", "B004WO9OMA", "B0009K7QZ8", "B0050MB5P2", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B0016OOM6W", "B000NOKFGW", "B003Y5HWGI", "B0012BS5XU", "B000FL7CAK", "B002BAW6I6", "B001EWDXT8", "B004AZ7ZKE", "B001MVWRMU", "B000065CVV", "B00AEBB8NS", "B000GYI32M", "B00EC9UHWG", "B004MWLXTY", "B002AMVEEM", "B001FB5TAY", "B00BETQ5Q4", "B001U9BS2O", "B00DRSGQ7I", "B005DCJ0Q0", "B001JAHQ16", "B00A8KJN8M", "B003LXM1PK", "B00BEIYG98", "B006DHAT5K", "B003L77G42", "B003T04NCE", "B0027CSMYA", "B0002V7TZQ", "B001RHGRU2", "B00JF5GAZA", "B002BAW6HW", "B001G0MFD8", "B00008AOX3", "B001MVWRMK", "B002VKE1KC", "B001K2LFNI", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B00AEBB8QK", "B001MVWRN4", "B001JAHQ1G", "B0058EE6OO", "B000094J5Z", "B000XCZGY0", "B000EHSVKK", "B000NA2BEU", "B00BNV9WEA", "B000G1R4SY", "B00ELKDDWM", "B0040QTNSA", "B002BJGYTY", "B000N6TYLW", "B007PKSNEI", "B0006FFRBG", "B00915G6R6", "B00G7QPXAI", "B000NA1PUG", "B000EAT23C", "B000HWZ4MA", "B0056GLNQI", "B001MVWRNE", "B00DDHFKMA", "B001GP5TMW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0077PTWHI", "B0077PTWY6", "B00BGQ2NDO", "B000TGURZ8"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 183373}, "asin": "B0001I55RY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514KZ0D880L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Felicity - Junior Year Collection (The Complete Third Season)"}

{"description": "It doesn't seem possible, but the second season ofSoapis even better than thefirst. Only the greatest primetime sitcoms achieve triple-threat genius: Casting, writing, and direction reached their zenith as the 1978-79 season began with a resolution to season 1's cliffhanger murder. Chester (Robert Mandan) loses his memory and wander out west while his ditzy wife Jessica (Katherine Helmond) enjoys a fling with the detective (new cast member John Byner) she'd hired to find Chester. Across town, the working-class Campbells have their own melodramas to contend with: Despite being gay, stepson Jodie (Billy Crystal) is an expectant father and moves in with pregnant Carol (Rebecca Balding), and later a lesbian roommate; Mary (Cathryn Damon) suspects Burt (Richard Mulligan) of having an affair; Corrine (Diana Canova) and ex-priest Tim (Sal Viscuso) have a baby that's demonically possessed; and Burt is abducted by aliens!Exorcisms and flying saucers might suggest desperation on the part of writer-creator Susan Harris, but the opposite is true: the controversy that plaguedSoap's first season had subsided (thanks to valiant defense by ABC President Fred Silverman), and Harris and Jay Sandrich (who directed 20 of these 22 episodes) were able to push their spoofy plots to even greater heights of absurdity without sacrificing the show's core integrity. Jimmy Baio (as Billy Tate) gets his moment to shine, and Robert Guillaume (as Benson) deservedly won an Emmy for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. Most impressively,Soapbuilt its madness upon a solid tragi-comic foundation, with risky shifts of tone and characters invested with surprising depth and compassion. The episodes are consistently full of classic scenes and side-splitting dialogue. In a 20-minute bonus featurette, Harris and coproducers Paul Witt and Tony Thomas reveal how luck, timing, talent, and network support brought the series to life. Simply put, it doesn't get any better than this.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00361XWFA", "B00361XWEQ", "B00361XWFK", "B000Q6GUJS", "B000MEYKA0", "B00008EY6N", "B00LMKKY2Q", "B0002NY8R6", "B0006Q93BU", "B000A0GOP0", "B002PQ7JR4", "B0006N2EZK", "B00HNGC56G", "B000FTC1GW", "B000MXPE6U", "B00ESZZOM2", "B0002PYTD2", "B000MGTQ6G", "B000YGGNGK", "B0025KVNOU", "B005BUA1JY", "B00HRUQB5O", "B0006N2EZA", "B001OXLGK0", "B000291Q3O", "B000EQ46HI", "B0011N19HI", "B000FFJ8BM", "B0000E32X2", "B000LC4Z8K", "B000CNE0SS", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B001RXDLZ0", "B000N6UF10", "B004J713KQ", "B000E33VYU", "B002WN8IR0", "B000FDFSH2", "B003XMKU0W", "B0006IUDYY", "B00004RE45", "B0001NBNIY", "B00006J6XI", "B000MGTQ6Q", "B00IFK7ONI", "B000EXDS02", "B003BGZ618", "B002AT8KBU", "1593936877", "B00GC2KI2U", "B000UX6TL6", "B001N26GSE", "B00000K3U3", "B000CNE0T2", "B00GHH9HW2", "B0007Y08JW", "B005CGI4EG", "B000EXDS34", "B000YKYT1M", "B0001BS3IE", "B000VNMMVG", "B00441GYXS", "B000GTLB6C", "B00DXLO0D6", "B001D2WUDE", "B00006J6XH", "B0016MJ73M", "B00FM4S7P4", "B000BOH990", "B005KK2FTO", "B000BOH98G", "B00D2UMHB0", "B00DJYK1XU", "B00008EYBH", "B000TD2KY2", "B000R7I3YG", "B002PQ7JQU", "B00065GX8C", "B001L1S1R6", "B005GZM0J8", "B000UX6TLG", "B00BM2JVAA", "B000HT38IK", "B002TQKL16", "B000MGBSH6", "B0000AQS8B", "B000BZISRQ", "B0001907BW", "B001BGS17Q", "B00008WJEZ", "B001JFKWE4", "B0001JXP2A", "B00D4ABT8K", "B00DXLO086", "B000AA4KQ0", "B0045HCJKS", "B0000798EY", "B000UAE7DQ", "B000G6BL7O", "B000BOH986"], "bought_together": ["B00361XWEQ", "B00361XWFA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00361XWEQ", "B00361XWFK", "B00361XWFA", "B0016MJ73M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 102592}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.99, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000255LJ8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VRQYPX54L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Soap - The Complete Second Season"}

{"description": "Prepare to get hooked onEverwood, a family drama-comedy from the WB television network that looks and feels like a hybrid ofNorthern ExposureandPicket Fences--both shows, incidentally, being major influences onEverwood's talented creator, Greg Berlanti (Dawson's Creek). A fish-out-of-water tale with unusually high stakes in the relationship arena,Everwoodgets much of its charge from near-perfect performances by Treat Williams (The Deep End of the Ocean) and Gregory Smith (The Patriot) as a contentious father and son trying to keep their family going after a catastrophic loss. Williams plays Andy Brown, a world-class neurosurgeon whose Manhattan practice caters to the rich and famous; it also keeps him far removed from daily life and big events within his family. After Andy's wife (Brenda Strong) dies in a car accident, he finds himself raising a gifted 15-year-old boy, Ephram (Smith), who hates him because of years of neglect, and the much younger Delia (Vivien Cardone fromA Beautiful Mind), who is scared and confused without her mom.Andy, often seen in the first couple of episodes speaking to his late spouse, decides the best way to honor her memory is to move the family to little Everwood, Colorado, a special place in her memory. Not just a move--more of a wholesale re-invention, beginning with Andy's new salt-and-pepper beard and including a no-charge medical clinic he opens in Everwood's former train station. The free practice puts Andy at odds with the unpleasant Dr. Abbott (Tom Amandes of the syndicatedThe Untouchables), whose daughter, Amy (Emily VanCamp), develops a friendship with lonely Ephram while she also pines for her boyfriend, Colin (Mike Erwin), long lost in a deep coma. Over the course of the first season, many lines of connection will be drawn between these folks. Andy will be asked to attempt a risky operation on Colin, with ramifications affecting his son, Amy, and others. Abbott's sour relationship with Andy will lighten up enough for the former to join Andy's practice, and other surprises are in store.The series is filled out by other, sweet and eccentric regulars, including Debra Mooney as Andy's nurse (also Abbott's plain-speaking mom), John Beasley as her husband and Delia's bus driver, and Stephanie Niznik as Andy's neighbor, Nina, a surrogate mother. Surprisingly gutsy storytelling, generally understated dialogue, heartfelt performances, and gorgeous Colorado exteriors keep one coming back for more.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000LXH3SI", "B001UHOWYM", "B001ULCY48", "B003R0MF6W", "B000U1ZV2G", "B0077PTWY6", "B0077PTWHI", "B00BGQ2NIO", "B000FUTVPA", "B00BGQ2NDO", "B001FB5TAY", "B0001IN0T4", "B000R7HRRA", "B00DRSGQ7I", "B0018CWEVW", "B001VPJYZU", "B003L77G56", "B000V7HGM2", "B000CRR3OC", "B000NOKFGW", "B006HAJAQ2", "B00127RAGM", "B003F3NE7K", "B000TGURZ8", "B00BBGZ17O", "B00008AOX3", "B001NY4X0U", "B000P6YNT8", "B008FTX6MM", "B000BNXD6O", "B0007TKHKC", "B001AQT158", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B00JF5GAZA", "B00DDHFKMA", "B00BC0JH24", "B003LXM1PK", "B00F1FVKVC", "B005CGI3ZG", "B0009K7QZ8", "B003LXM1B4", "B000HWZ4MA", "B003QZSWRY", "B0001CCXZW", "B0013DZNAA", "B00JM5C8WM", "B000K7VHJ6", "B0015XWU9K", "B000NA2BEU", "B0000E5NPY", "B000GYI32M", "B0002V7TZQ", "B002KQ6UE2", "B0018CWF02", "B0009F43DG", "B0037XPPAM", "B000FL7CAK", "B005BO5MWG", "B00369ERC4", "B009ERK2UI", "B00GTZWUPS", "B0011UBDS6", "B003L77G42", "B008817WUY", "B00133QNS6", "B001TKJDIU", "B003L77H1Y", "B002BAW6HW", "B0002I838Q", "B0018CWEZI", "B000RF1QE2", "B00A8KJN8M", "B003F3NDW6", "B001VPJZ0E", "B00005JNJ1", "B0051GOB2G", "B001MVWRNE", "B0050MB5P2", "B004YPED14", "B0096UJ94I", "B002DQSKME", "B005LAJ212", "B00540G3GG", "B001CQONOK", "B0007V6IW6", "B000NA1PUG", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B009DJKKKE", "B00B5AAW52", "B0008FXSSI", "B009M7R2LM", "B00ECIS3W8", "B0006UEVTK", "B003R0MEXQ", "B000N3T0EG", "B008817XIK", "B002ZHKZFQ", "B001FQRIRG", "B001SGVDPG", "B0006FFRBG"], "bought_together": ["B000LXH3SI", "B001UHOWYM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001UHOWYM", "B000LXH3SI", "B001ULCY48", "B005BO5MWG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 126410}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.69, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B0002DB0FO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ugsF-lhkL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Everwood - The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "There will be a debate of which 2004 DVD collection of Marx Brothers films was better. This Universal release of the better known Paramount-produced films are the only ones starring all four brothers: Groucho, Chico, Harpo, and Zeppo. TheWarner collectioncontains less-vital films, but is loaded with extras and commentaries. The Universal collection contains only 20 minutes of interviews from NBC'sToday Show--interesting but short--with Harpo, Groucho, and Harpo's son Bill from the '60s and '70s. All of the films in this collection were released on DVD by Image Entertainment in 2000 and the prints look the same, which isn't necessarily bad; one just wishes a major restoration had been undertaken.The films--packaged handsomely with a booklet--are essential Marx Brothers, their first five films made from 1929 to 1933. The least timeless is their first,The Cocoanuts, based on their Broadway hit. The film--one of the first full talkies--takes place in a hotel with owner Groucho out to grab every dollar.Animal Crackersis the brothers' first classic, a lickety-split comedy about an art theft being investigated by Groucho's alter-image, Captain Spaulding. For introducing youngsters to the work of Marx,Monkey Businessis the best way. The shenanigans start right at the start as the brothers stowaway on a luxury liner. It's their first film that wasn't based on a play, as they endeavored to find new material.Horse Feathersgave them more fertile ground plus a sure-fire Hollywood director at the helm (Norman McLeoad). Their fantasia of college life includes the riotous football-game finale. Music, always a key part of their plays and films is given more weight here and includes Groucho's theme, \"I'm Against It.\" Music is again key as the musicals of the era are spoofed in the brothers' undisputed masterpiece,Duck Soup. From a land called Fredonia, Groucho plays a slapdash ruler who rewrites the rules of governing, leading to a most memorable war with Sylvania (so war gets lampooned. too).Duck Soupalso boasts the most famous Marx brothers sketch: Groucho trying to fool his mirror.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001HAIP4", "B00BY0EBDC", "B002TSAAAG", "B0001HAINQ", "B002ID099O", "B000LC4C0Q", "B0002KGXZO", "0879100362", "B000E6ESX0", "B00ILGPI9I", "B004P9UWM8", "B0000WN0PA", "B006WN5W5M", "B004P9UWL4", "B00006SFJ7", "0306806665", "B00JRHW4GK", "B000SSQ7JW", "B00406UJZG", "B0001FGBZW", "B00008ZZ7B", "B001FD6MJO", "B0002HS738", "B0001HAIMW", "B00KIZY3XW", "B005BYBZKY", "B00BX49C3S", "0517515466", "B00143XDYM", "0783228457", "B004P9UWLY", "B005DDN51A", "B0001JXP2A", "B003ZYU3T6", "1416536035", "B008FYZHHE", "B0024FAG1C", "B00005UMFC", "B005F265CU", "B004NWPXZS", "B00406UJWE", "B00000ILEU", "B0045HCJHG", "B0000648YD", "B000TXP56M", "B008M4C1BC", "B0081NAVGG", "B00CHMBQCU", "B001AXL67W", "B00005RDRL", "B005F265IE", "B000B5XORU", "B00A04YHI2", "B0007939MK", "B001EXE2Y2", "B0009W5J6E", "0783225903", "B00ESZZOLI", "B00006RCNV", "B0000BV1XX", "B007N31YH0", "B00023P4O2", "B002VWNIAY", "B000N3T0H8", "B002GSXKPQ", "B00AEFYR9G", "B00EO2I6RO", "B001B23ED6", "B00518A70E", "B007FQXEVY", "B0072BNJZ8", "B000E33W26", "B00J2PQZEY", "B0007ZEO8C", "B004UOHNH0", "B004GJYR7I", "B00IF0KASY", "B00CVB6XF2", "B00008RH3L", "B00005JKF6", "B0002AHW3G", "B00AMDA2OY", "B005EVY8MQ", "B00D9EJFZA", "B001E18222", "B0036FJ6OM", "B000E8JO32", "B000HT3PF6", "B0090XLDKY", "B000WGYMB0", "B00E44EZUE", "B000A1INJE", "B00005QEO0", "B00BY8DAAE", "B001IHJ988", "B001KXZGNW", "B00151QYYE", "B0009S4J3M", "B007REV4LQ", "B00004R99Y"], "bought_together": ["B0001HAIP4", "B00BY0EBDC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001HAIP4", "B004P9UWM8", "B002TSAAAG", "B0001HAINQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 36968}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 37.78, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

{"description": "Winner of the Outstanding Comedy Series Emmy its first year out,Arrested Developmentis the kind of sitcom that gives you hope for television. A mockumentary-style exploration of the beleaguered Bluth family, it's one of those idiosyncratic shows that doesn't rely on a laugh track or a studio audience; it's shot more like a TV drama, albeit with an omniscient narrator (executive producer Ron Howard) overseeing the proceedings. Holding the Bluths together just barely is son Michael Bluth (Jason Bateman), the only normal guy in a family that's chock full of nuts. Hardworking and sensible, Michael's certain he's going to be given control of his family's Enron-style corporation upon the retirement of his father (Jeffrey Tambor). The fact that he's passed over instead for his mother (Jessica Walter) is only a blip when compared to his father's immediate arrest for dubious accounting practices, and the resulting freeze on the family's previously limitless wealth.Bereft of money, and even less family love, the Bluths have to band together in their moment of need--not easy when everyone's looking out for number 1. In addition to his scabrous parents, Michael has to contend with his lothario older brother (Will Arnett), his basically useless younger brother (Tony Hale), his greedy twin sister (Portia DeRossi), and her sexually ambiguous husband (David Cross). Michael's only comrade in sanity is his son George Michael (Michael Cera), but then again, the teenage boy harbors a secret crush on his cousin (Alia Shawkat). A peerless ensemble led by the brilliant Bateman (who ever knew he could be this good?), all the actors are pitch-perfect in their roles, delivering the dryly funny, sometimes absurdist dialogue with the speed and flair of classic farce.  The unusual tone ofArrested Developmenttakes a bit of getting used to--it's far different from anything you'll see on TV, even HBO--but once you buy in to the Bluths' innumerable dysfunctions, you'll be laughing your head off for hours.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000A9QKRI", "B000EXDS7K", "B000RBA6CO", "B002DPPH6W", "B000RW3VDE", "B0024FAD9M", "B001B9LWME", "B0018RKEQE", "B002N5N5NE", "B00ICR6SBI", "B0009VBTP0", "B0002W4P98", "B001L1S1PS", "B0058JEHTS", "B002N5N5PM", "B003L77GE2", "B001DJLCRC", "B0000E2PVR", "B0024FAD9W", "B003L77GJM", "B002JVWQSW", "B000SINT4S", "B0053O8ACS", "B00AQ7EJ04", "B00005JNOG", "B000YABIQ6", "B000FFJYE8", "B001DPHDBU", "B00005JNEQ", "B0033WH6MW", "B005OZIV20", "B002N5N5KW", "B0058JEHSO", "B000GETTKM", "B00008YGRS", "B002N5N5SO", "B00475B0G2", "B008412UKA", "B003L77G06", "B000EBGFPY", "B007QU37LG", "B00J5LXT44", "B000AJJNI6", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B005S97V82", "B00HW3EXCE", "B00AB65SVE", "B000BNI90Y", "B000HT3P7E", "B003DZX46G", "B002N5N5LG", "B0032UYFA6", "B003R4ZMOA", "B001IBIDLI", "B009LDD40U", "B001GCUER0", "B000TGURZ8", "B001VPJYZ0", "B0038M2AOG", "B000P2A6C0", "B002AMVED8", "B003UD7JDA", "B00005JLEX", "B00INLE5K4", "B00166UFSY", "B001RTSPVY", "B001NOMOS8", "B007CO5MVE", "B000U1ZV1W", "B003L77G3I", "B00007149S", "B002LITH76", "B00EEDNR9A", "B000GPIPTM", "B0058EE6OO", "B00BI7ZAM2", "B001AEF6AY", "B000AJJNFE", "B003L77GBU", "B001YYQA0K", "B000E0OE4O", "B003L77GTC", "B000E3L7F0", "B000YAA2SQ", "B0012CJQY6", "B00443FN1A", "B002OOWKSU", "B001MVWRNE", "B00079FUI6", "B000NOKFH6", "B0060MYKYY", "B00BT1XCOU", "B0018CWEYO", "B00BGI07NK", "B001QE99AQ", "B0058YPG1G", "B005Y1ZU6Y", "B0010X744G", "B00BTRKMNI"], "bought_together": ["B000A9QKRI", "B000EXDS7K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00EPH8S58", "B00CE4L28E", "B000EXDS7K", "B000A9QKRI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 20221}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 12.49, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B0002PYS7Y", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51mhi7ed5ML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Arrested Development: Season 1"}

{"description": "Launched during the neon-lit 1980s,The Golden Girlsshed light on a side of Miami ignored byMiami Vice. In other words, no drugs, no murder--just four women of \"a certain age,\" spending their golden years in the sun. Like the theme, \"Thank You for Being a Friend,\" the long-running sitcom was about friendship (not crime). As for the \"girls,\" they were tart-tongued Dorothy (Beatrice Arthur), former farm girl Rose (Betty White), Southern belle Blanche (Rue McClanahan), and Dorothy's salty Sicilian mother Sophia (Estelle Getty). All were widows, with the exception of the divorced Dorothy.  Created by Emmy-winning producer Susan Harris (Soap),The Golden Girlsre-ignited the careers of 1970s TV veterans Arthur (All in the Family,Maude) and White (The Mary Tyler Moore Show). At the same time, it made stars of McClanahan (who co-starred onMaude), by playing a comic version ofA Streetcar Named Desire's Blanche Dubois, and the scene-stealing Getty, made to look older than her actual age (she and Arthur were born the same year).Notable guests to lend their talents to the first season includeStar Trek: Voyager's Robert Picardo (\"The Operation\"),Alice's Polly Holliday (\"Blind Ambitions\"), andWKRP in Cincinnati's Gordon Jump (\"Big Daddy\"). In addition, Harold Gould (Rhoda), who appears in \"Rose the Prude,\" would return as a (different) recurring character five years later.The Golden Girlsran for seven seasons and spawned spin-offThe Golden Palace(without Arthur) and a British version calledThe Brighton Belles. By the end of its run in 1992, it had garnered numerous awards, including two Emmys for best comedy series. In addition, each of the four actresses received a well-deserved Emmy for her efforts.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "The bonus material is comprised of nine 4-6 minutes featurettes on various aspects of the production, giving insight on how the selection of director Paul Greengrass--with his documentary, impromptu methods--led to the film's much-talked-about style. The most interesting are about how they blow up things (without a computer) and a look at the Go Mobile, a new rig to capture a car chase on film. Even though it's not listed on the packaging, there is a commentary track with the director (uninteresting as it is). Something that is listed on the package, \"Explosive Deleted Scenes,\" is really about 7 minutes of ho-hum expository scenes. Note: the frantic, hand-held camera work in the film makes it hard to view on the small screen, especially on the full-screen edition.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000VWYJ86", "B00023B1LC", "B005LAIIPS", "B002ZG97RE", "B000W1V5VU", "B0000B1OFL", "B000EGDB10", "B0007P0XBO", "B000P0J0BK", "B001TODCII", "B000QEIOTO", "B002ZHKZD8", "B00AEBB86A", "B002ZHKZCO", "B003QO8TOQ", "B0002VEUV2", "B00AQSN7HE", "B007REV4T8", "B004EPYZUS", "B003Q6D2B4", "B000HRMAPE", "B00121QGPY", "B00AEFXYJA", "B00005JNJV", "B00005JL5F", "B001PPLIEG", "B00429C1TI", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00005JM5E", "B000AYELVU", "B0021L8V0M", "B00005JN5E", "B00008G8M4", "B005LAIGRS", "B00005JN2Z", "6305428115", "B002GSXKP6", "B00008AOVL", "B000P0J0AQ", "B002XMGGK6", "B0046BI81W", "B00AEFY5B6", "B004LWZWGA", "B00BUAEYVK", "B00005JLSB", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00AS1Q93S", "B002T9H2LA", "B008JFURII", "B000I0RQVI", "B00151QYCQ", "B000M341QE", "B002HWRYJE", "B0002HOEC6", "B000F6IOC0", "B003L20IG0", "B0067EKYAY", "B00005JKYX", "B005LAIIQC", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00E5I2MCM", "B004A8ZX28", "B007K3JFUQ", "B005LAIGLE", "B0002V7OI8", "B000RPCK1U", "B00005B6JZ", "B00DSDUVFK", "B00004Z4WR", "B001OQCV6A", "B0000VAFO0", "B005PTYP70", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00AEFY0F2", "B003AWRMCE", "B00005JOC9", "B003ASLJRC", "B003ASLJIQ", "B0007KIFGE", "B000YGDNPO", "B00016MSV2", "B00001ZWUS", "B0004Z33EG", "B00004STUL", "B0000897EG", "B004EPYZP8", "B000MXPE7O", "B00012QLB4", "B004LWZW42", "B001QB9H10", "B001QTXM5Y", "B000GFLKF8", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001HN697M", "B000W9DTG6", "B00003CXC5", "B0007WFX62", "B000R9U3B0", "B001TK80C0"], "bought_together": ["B000VWYJ86", "B00023B1LC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001F12J0C", "B000VWYJ86", "B005LAIIPS", "B00023B1LC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 16071}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B0002ZDVEU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H2QD8RJ8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Bourne Supremacy (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "From the creators ofBatman: The Animated Seriescomes DC Comics' polar opposite: the Man of Steel inSuperman: The Animated Series, Volume One. Like the Dark Knight's series,Superman: The Animated Seriesis a successful, modern telling of the classic story. Superman's tale is already known to most people, enduring as a modern American myth. The challenge for the producers was how to make something old and familiar new again. Quite successfully, they managed to modernize the Superman environment and its characters enough to attract a new audience but also maintained the integrity of the mythos to satisfy longtime fans. What liftsSuperman: The Animated Seriesabove all past Superman shows is its high-quality animation, strong dramatic scripts, a star studded cast, and the creators' willingness to present the show more like a series than a cartoon. It begins with a three-part episode (\"The Last Son of Krypton\") chronicling the last days of Krypton, the introduction of Braniac, Kal-El's trip to Earth, his development into Superman, and finally his introduction to the world. These three episodes lay the foundation for the next 15 adventures that follow, including confrontations with rivals Lex Luthor, Metallo, Braniac, the bizarre Lobo, and others. For fans of Superman, DC Comics, superheroes, the comic genre, and action tales in general,Superman: The Animated Seriesis not to be missed.--Rob Bracco", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000B7QCGS", "B000F4RH8E", "B000B7QCHC", "B0007XG43W", "B0002ZMHWM", "B000CSTK3S", "B000F4RH8O", "B00023E894", "B000GYI33Q", "B000LE17A2", "B000GYI336", "B000CSTK42", "B000LE1798", "B000YDBP84", "B000A9QKLO", "B000A9QKLE", "B000A9QKL4", "B00LT1JHLW", "B000UPMZ1M", "B00005Y71G", "B000M2E32W", "B0016OM3WC", "B000CEXFZ6", "B000FZETS4", "B000F0V0LS", "B0018TNMCA", "B001LK8SQ6", "B005SH63HO", "B003L7DK88", "B00280LZBI", "B000PFSYO4", "B001QIVEVE", "B0009UZG28", "B000A59PLU", "B000OPODNQ", "B001A5ES9I", "B000PE0G0A", "B0007XFZMS", "B001QIVEVO", "B001OD8E4G", "B004L9GM3A", "B002DYKPF6", "B004VWKD3M", "B0000VCZLG", "B002DYKPFQ", "B004QOB8PW", "B000OPODNG", "B00GZ0ML2Y", "6305943389", "B005HN69G4", "B002FGUHBE", "B0081BEZXS", "B00BBAQD6S", "B001614E68", "B0001HAI0E", "B006PA0WF2", "B00HMOW9YM", "B00IGVJH0E", "B00CENSU1W", "B00023E88U", "B001LK8TEM", "B000CEXFZG", "B002A5EBLW", "B00GD9GNEY", "B0001A7V1U", "B00CPEK3NI", "B00CENWUYK", "B003UN2ILS", "B0036EH3XY", "B009OAWMK8", "B000M2E33G", "B00ISDJUYI", "B0007US7CQ", "B003XTUAWI", "B000TSTEJG", "B00GZ0ML4C", "B00GD9GNUS", "B000PC8AKK", "B007RG8ZF2", "B002YOKVUY", "B003UN2ICM", "B000UPMZ1C", "B0000X2ECY", "B000FZETRU", "B002K0WBDM", "B003XTUAHS", "B004EE30C8", "B0016PURB0", "B007KW5MOU", "B002S3Y1LQ", "B003Z8ZCDO", "B00005Y71H", "B003ITZBVS", "B00I099JZK", "B0007VY40E", "B002JUFPXG", "B00DP9RYDY", "B003M8NGLC", "B0027FG29Y", "B007MCSV1O"], "bought_together": ["B000B7QCGS", "B000F4RH8E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000B7QCGS", "B002LWJ510", "B0002ZMHWM", "B000B7QCHC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 73066}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 13.64, "brand": "WEA", "asin": "B0002ZMHX6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61S4EGDCR1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Superman: The Animated Series, Volume 1 (DC Comics Classic Collection)"}

{"description": "LikeGattacadid before it,Code 46extrapolates from the present to posit a chilling, dystopian look at our genetically regimented future. In the corporate-controlled, near-future scenario presented by prolific director Michael Winterbottom and his regular screenwriter Frank Cottrell Boyce, nations and languages have merged to form a polyglot society in which genetic imperfections are avoided by the strict enforcement of Code 46, which prohibits sex between people who share 100%, 50%, or even 25% matching DNA. As an insurance-fraud investigator in Shanghai to investigate the issuance of forged passports (a major offense in an overcrowded world), Tim Robbins meets his prime suspect (Samantha Morton, echoing her role inMinority Report), and their violation of Code 46 has tragic and ultimately dehumanizing repercussions. Fascinating as a \"what-if\" scenario, Winterbottom's film is more successful as a melancholy mood-piece than a science-fiction tale. While the plot and characters suffer from occasionally vague definition,Code 46offers a fascinating study of human longing in an age of oppressive globalization.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00K0MM4AM", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B004SUDQ72", "B0018O4YT0", "B0002CHIKG", "0783225903", "0767805712", "B000I8OOG0", "B00000K3TS", "B000HOL67U", "B0001Z37IG", "078401213X", "B000056N2Z", "B003TRMLM6", "B00000JSJC", "B000JMK6LW", "B000C20VVE", "B009POCG0Y", "B00JAQJNN0", "0767821629", "B00J4LMJ3W", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B004EQAVHI", "B008B9JTDQ", "B0000AOX0F", "B000UYX4Q8", "B0013LL2Z2", "B000ADWDFC", "B00000F4MA", "B000BGH29K", "B00003CXZ4", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B003U6SJY0", "B004EQAVFU", "B00005UQ9T", "B0045HCJ8K", "B00009ATIX", "B003XURDAY", "B001FOPOD8", "0780021541", "B00005JL6M", "B008220DGE", "B00005JL78", "B000087F6L", "B000QXDCJ2", "B0036TGSR6", "B00005R87B", "B009ERK35W", "B00H3JHGBC", "B00005QCVN", "B00CHMBQRA", "155890834X", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B007REV4LQ", "B002FUI4CE", "B003O7I6SE", "B004U7MQWY", "B000A2T2VG", "B00B2BYXSG", "B000O7667K", "B00067BBMS", "B003TRMLQM", "B00018D3V4", "B004FQX59S", "B0069UP2PI", "B00C7A8WZQ", "B00003CXGA", "B00005JKJA", "B000NJL4QC", "B004WCTLNY", "6305428115", "B000HEWEJ4", "B00BC75H5S", "B000CNESU8", "B005LAII3A", "B004LWZW7E", "B001LMAK88", "0767821408", "B00004TA8X", "B002CA68GQ"], "bought_together": ["0783225903"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0018O4YT0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 171201}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.99, "brand": "TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX HOME ENT", "asin": "B00067BBMI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510M83ND4ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Code 46"}

This ideal bachelor lifestyle ends up unraveling and Alfie must learn to admit defeat and change his ways.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000055ZF8", "B000N4SHOO", "B004499LX0", "B00AEBB8SS", "B0000714C4", "B0016MJ6HY", "B000QGDXG6", "B001221DU6", "B000056VOT", "B004SUDQ72", "B002Q3MZXE", "B002ZG98SW", "B000MQC9H4", "B004XVMCK8", "B0006IIPIK", "B00005V5NU", "B00BNWWVFG", "B004SIP6QI", "B00003CXXP", "B000F3UA5M", "B00001PE4D", "B000F7CECK", "0783229402", "B000056HP2", "B0013XZ6X4", "B004499LWQ", "B0009X7BDC", "B00005JLX8", "B00006ZXSO", "B002OVED88", "B001OXLGJQ", "B00I4CWIVU", "B000BVM1S2", "B00005V4XV", "B0000E32YH", "B00DVD5SBE", "B000FIHN5M", "B0036TGTDE", "B0006IIPLM", "B00AEFYC96", "B000EQHXNW", "B000H5TH1Q", "1419897543", "B000ALM40I", "B003Y5H574", "B000WC38WI", "B0026IQTQI", "B008PZ69RU", "B0037QGS0A", "B00DJYJQSQ", "B00AEFXVCU", "B00007JXWX", "B000059TG7", "B0009I8QHC", "B001DJ7PR8", "B0038N9X3Q", "B004L3AR0K", "B000EDWKXI", "B004YCKJNI", "B0009UZGIM", "B000E5KURY", "B004SEUIU6", "B001DB6J6Y", "B00AEBB9M8", "B00575GYU8", "B0040ILVME", "B004SUDQC2", "B0029Z8K74", "B0006TPE4C", "B008PZ69M0", "0792844874", "0767805712", "6305308837", "B000U1ZV8A", "B001URA5Y8", "B003U6SJY0", "B00005YUPD", "B002ZG98FU", "B00079Z9VO", "B002CLKOWO", "B000OY8NBK", "B002AT4JOM", "0780621611", "B002NPY7EU", "B005HI4LMI", "B006GL8NQ0", "B000AAF27G", "B00003CXPV", "B004FQX58O", "B001FB55L2", "B00005JKMQ", "B000KX0IOK", "B004SIP9X8", "B0007G89FK", "B00003CY0V", "B00441GYR4", "B00005YUPC", "B000BKVQS4", "B00008K7AO", "B0013F2ESM"], "bought_together": ["B000055ZF8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000055ZF8", "B0000714C4", "B00AEFXE9U", "B000QGDXG6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 95460}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.99, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B00077BOFG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HVKMPCCDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Alfie (Widescreen Special Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "The highly acclaimed, award-winning Turkish filmDistantis a deeply compassionate and frequently amusing study of quiet desperation, prompting many critics to favorably compare writer-director Nuri Bilge Ceylan's subtly hypnotic drama to the films of Ozu and Tarkovsky. Watch closely and you'll recognize someone you know, or even yourself, and the quietest moments are the most enjoyably revealing. Muzaffer &#xD6;zdemir and Mehmet Emin Toprak shared Best Actor honors at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival for their perfectly nuanced performances as (respectively) divorced, 40-something photographer Mahmut and his distant relative Yusef, who arrives in Istanbul looking for work, and quickly wears out his welcome. Tensions mount, revealing solitude as the natural (if not preferred) state of these lonely, melancholy men. (In the context of this film, it's tragically ironic that Toprak was killed in an auto accident, at age 28, six months before his honors at Cannes.) With understated humor, Ceylan observes Mahmut and Yusef's chronic isolation, but he never passes judgment.Distantcould've been made anywhere and it would yield the same visually seductive study of detachment. Tune into its wavelength and you'll find it unforgettable.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000OYNVOO", "B002HMUUP4", "B007FEHA0C", "B00005JKGX", "B007P470R0", "B000E0OE44", "B000I8OOG0", "B0016K3988", "B007FDT0LU", "B0087OULO6", "B00AQ6J3AG", "B001DB6J82", "B009RWRIMA", "B00I3C1T1Q", "B00772HQTC", "B000GDH9K0", "B005P2BLC4", "B002U4F5W2", "B00GOT165E", "B00092ZLEY", "B00G7QPXUI", "B00GMV8B1G", "B00006ADES", "B00H91LWBY", "B00049QR18", "B000WOSAU6", "B006G2FK10", "B00AIBZLHS", "B00HE010QM", "B004VH657U", "6305744114", "B008D19WMU", "B008ZDC7M8", "B000GBEWMA", "B00031TYGW", "0780023307", "B00F98FNNM", "B00HE01030", "B00004W229", "B001BEK8CE", "B00DZP1BUU", "B000BB14IA", "B00062134E", "B00000F7E6", "B007P4SQB4", "B00GA9F2PI", "B004VTLO9M", "B00GBT62PQ", "B003UESJIS", "B00H0EN948", "B0000B1A5P", "B00006JMQH", "B002ZXZJ9C", "B00005PJ6Y", "B000GFLEM2", "B000SIWHAK", "B0002KQOH6", "B000GTJSE4", "B00009Y3OK", "B00DEKKEPO", "B001152TL6", "B00005BHW6", "B001MYIXAC", "B000FS9FM6", "B00HT2RTU6", "B000BB14I0", "B00BJB2H1E", "B00003CXUM", "B003IPJKX2", "B0000A02TX", "B000YMDIZS", "B00DYVUBYM", "B00AZMFM3I", "B00B2BYY1M", "B0009VND0E", "B001MPS7GG", "B00EO2I6QK", "B002JTMNZA", "B00ATK02FO", "B004CGUC10", "B000O77R6E", "B0002F6BFG", "B000E6EGT6", "B00005RRJE", "B0027AB988", "B006Z7Z3WW", "B001IZNIV4", "B001FWVKVA", "B0069UV0AY", "B0001EFUFK", "B004NWPY34", "B008DCAG9M", "B000GRUMZA", "B0009IWFD8", "B0019X40CG", "B00CCI2CU4", "B005TJ8GJ4", "B005BXSD2S", "B00006IUII", "B00007L4MH"], "bought_together": ["B000OYNVOO", "B002HMUUP4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007FEHA0C", "B000OYNVOO", "B002HMUUP4", "B0045ZAQSM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 42040}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 29.46, "brand": "", "asin": "B0007939R0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SD5BR00WL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Distant"}

{"description": "While 2003'sDaredevilwas a conventional superhero movie, the 2005 spinoff,Elektra, is more of awuxia-styled martial arts/fantasy flick. Elektra (Jennifer Garner) has returned to her life as a hired assassin, but she balks at an assignment to kill a single father (Goran Visnjic,ER) and his teenage daughter (Kirsten Prout). That makes her the target of the Hand, an organization of murderous ninjas, scheming corporate types, and a band of stylish supervillains seeking to eliminate Elektra and tip the balance of power in the ongoing battle of good vs. evil.As the star ofAlias, Garner has proven that she can kick butt with the best of them, and some of the visual effects are impressive, but the action sequences tend to be anticlimactic, and there's not much to the story. Fans will notice numerous references toFrank Miller's comic books, but there's very little resemblance to Miller's cold-blooded killer (Elektra with an agent? Elektra referring to herself as a \"soccer mom\"?).IsElektrabetter thanDaredevil? Not really, even with the distinct advantage of having all Garner and no Ben Affleck. That could be the spinoff's greatest disappointment: afterSpider-Man 2raised the bar for comic-book movies,Elektralowered it back toDaredevil's level.  Directed by Rob Bowman (theX-Filesmovie), and featuring Terence Stamp as the mysterious mentor Stick, Will Yun Lee (Die Another Day) as the chief villain, and NFL-player-turned-mixed-martial-arts-champion Bob Sapp as the immovable Stone.DVD featuresBen Affleck's much-rumored cameo is one of the deleted scenes on theElektraDVD.  It's a one-minute throwaway, and while he's supposedly appearing as Matt Murdock (who romanced Elektra inDaredevil), the barrage of celebrity gossip makes it impossible to see him as anything other than Jennifer Garner's real-life boyfriend.  There's also a making-of featurette, which is mostly promotional hype other than a few interesting effects shots; four editing featurettes; and Jennifer Garner's videotaped message to ComicCon.--David HoriuchiMore onElektraElektra: The Album(Soundtrack CD)Elektra: The Movie(Comic Adaptation)Frank Miller Comic BooksDaredevil(Director's Cut) (DVD)Jennifer Garner stars inAlias(DVD)More Superhero DVDs", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000959N0", "B000VI70QS", "B00005JNTU", "B0006L0LOS", "B000FGGE68", "B001QB9H1U", "B001CDR1FG", "B000OVLBF8", "B00AEFXCLU", "B0002IQMAM", "B005LAIGW8", "B001DHXT20", "B004EPZ07K", "B001F7MSFM", "B001GCUO1Q", "B0009A409S", "B008JFUS0U", "B002GSXKNI", "B00E5I2MEK", "B004LWZW42", "B0007V6ITE", "B000UR9T8C", "B001AK3S4Y", "B00K7IPFSM", "B00E5I2MCM", "078401132X", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00005JM5B", "B0090SI56Y", "B00005JKWJ", "B004LWZWFQ", "B0002KVUKM", "B000HCO83Q", "B003YOZNBU", "B000J10EQU", "B00003CXZ1", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000AYELVU", "B00005JMQW", "B008JFUO72", "B003Y5H5EW", "B000HEVZ9E", "B000AYELVA", "B000VI28Z6", "B00JL6L4UY", "B009MO57H6", "B00AEFYGBA", "B002ZG99B8", "B0083SBMBM", "B001CC7PKS", "B00005JKCH", "B0007WFX62", "B0006IIPIK", "6307397594", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B0009MDPYM", "B001OQCVI8", "B00JPS7HOA", "0780624890", "B00F4FFO8E", "B002GSXKN8", "B008JFUPFI", "B00IKM5LXG", "B00177Y9ZC", "B003YAR97K", "B002ZG98UA", "B002NXSRVG", "B000EQHXN2", "B001RHGRT8", "B00IZZDWKM", "B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA", "B0021L8V0M", "B000VR0570", "1558908846", "B001HN697M", "B00005JLYW", "B008JFURII", "B001MVWRNE", "B001FB55HQ", "B005LAII44", "B00A2H9OSK", "B001QTXM5Y", "B002ZG983M", "B00BTYMPUY", "B002U4UZSQ", "B001QB9H2E", "B002ZG99G8", "B005G4TJUC", "B0012RLX88", "B003Q6D2B4", "B00195FUDC", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B001OQCUZM", "B00HMVJB0K", "B002ZG98N2", "B00005JNJV", "B004SIP9Z6", "B000K7UBSO", "B00HEPDGKA"], "bought_together": ["B0002XVQNU", "B000VI70QS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JLXE", "B0090SI56Y", "B00979KQAO", "B000VI28Z6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23534}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B0007P0Y7C", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R5W%2BoU9CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Elektra (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Let's just say Dr. Phil wouldn't last 10 minutes with the squabbling Teutels of Orange County Choppers in Rock Tavern, New York.American Choppers, the wildly entertaining reality series from cable's Discovery Channel, is a hybrid television show blending serious family dysfunction with gearhead razzmatazz and deadline tensions in a motor shop (as with that other Discovery series,Monster Garage, where nonconformist engineers work frantically to build unique vehicles).Choppersconcerns generational feuding between two highly talented designers and builders of one-of-a-kind, sometimes beautiful choppers (no, no--don't call them motorcycles), a father-and-son team who happen to share the same name. Fiftysomething Paul Teutel Sr. is the walrus-mustachioed owner of OCC, a boulder of a man with a sharp tongue, ironic sense of humor (he's the first to laugh hysterically when he and his son, simultaneously backing out of OCC's icy driveway in a macho display of speed, collide their trucks) and passive-aggressive tendencies. Even to a casual viewer, Paul Jr., OCC's Chief Fabricator and Designer, is clearly the target of his dad's mid-life anxiety over creeping irrelevancy. But the younger Teutel has a nasty streak, too, especially a working knowledge of how to make his father feel isolated, marginalized, even unloved.Most of the 13 episodes in this boxed set find Paul Jr. immersed in some kind of expensive project, building a spidery display chopper for a big trade show in New York City, a NASCAR-themed bike for a special event, or a Firebike to honor the fallen firefighters of 9/11. In each case, Paul Sr. hovers over his son's shoulder, observing skeptically, criticizing one or another detail, barking about the schedule. Junior fights back, attacking what he perceives as the old man's cluelessness, mocking his unwanted efforts to collaborate. It's ugly, but it's also compelling and somehow even fun--perhaps because both men are so transparent in their complementary issues. Not every episode is full of friction; there are lighter moments and times of emotional release and bonding. Late in the season, when Junior's brother Mikey gets involved in the family business, an added layer of sibling rivalry brings a whole new dimension to this unusual psychodrama.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007V6IVW", "B000B5IP1A", "B0034708LC", "B004LGGXFU", "B000TYWW80", "B000TYYNIW", "B002C8MD5I", "B002M3JJE6", "B000E1PFNW", "B001PJRAVM", "B000W4RNKO", "B0007V6IWG", "B000TEUSL8", "B003LLVVX0", "B000VZK1WQ", "B0012EBV6K", "B000TYV4SE", "B000UHYEUU", "B004MCGNU8", "B005F0TGXM", "B00316DAAC", "B000ND91OA", "B0008KLV8M", "B000MX7V7A", "B00062IDZQ", "B000NVIWNS", "B000QFCDAY", "B0015XWU9A", "B000I2J6W8", "B001CQS7KG", "B003QP4CZA", "B00BYS0S72", "B000V8B14U", "B00A4Y62DQ", "B000EYK4H6", "B0007US79Y", "B000TYYNBY", "B00AY9V3DU", "B000AJJNIQ", "B0002W4SWW", "B002CA68NO", "B00003CXOP", "0783227884", "B00005JLEX", "0446528013", "B000WHVMFI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0034708LC", "B004LGGXFU", "B0009Y2UTQ", "B0007V6IVW"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 133479}, "asin": "B0007V6IVM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AKMA1ABPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "American Chopper the Series - First Season"}
{"description": "Playwright David E. Talbert has become well-known for his inspirational, Christian-themed dramas featuring primarily African-American casts. HE SAY, SHE SAY BUT WHAT DOES GOD SAY?, one of Talbert's first hits, is presented here in a recording of the stage production. In one of Detroit's toughest neighborhoods, a small church finds itself stuck next door to a nightclub frequented by hustlers, pimps, and gangsters. Both the church's congregation and the club's dangerous owners decide to try and rid the neighborhood of the other, leading to uncertainty and a series of tense confrontations.

{"description": "Fans ofIce Princesswill enjoy seeing the five deleted scenes, even though like most DVD deleted scenes they wouldn't have added much to the film.  In fact, the alternate opening (an extended scene that flashes back to Casey's earlier childhood) and a later scene would have undesirably softened Joan Cusack's and Kim Cattrall's characters.  Some cut scenes involving Casey and her Snoplow classmates are fun.  The two music videos spotlight key songs from the soundtrack, Caleigh Peters's \"Reach\" and Ally & AJ's \"No One,\" but co-star Hayden Panettiere's \"I Fly\" is a curious omission.  The commentary track follows the Disney trend of featuring its young actors, in this case Michelle Trachtenberg (Casey), Panettiere (Gen), Trevor Blumas (Teddy), and Kirsten Olsen (Nikki, the \"Jumping Shrimp\").  Film aficionados won't learn that much about the crafting of the movie, but the kids have spirit and talk about the \"exploding butt shot\" and who already knew how to skate.  It can be a little tricky to figure which girl is speaking, though.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002WY65V0", "B004CYVZ4K", "B000CCBCAI", "B0007US7C6", "B00005JMCW", "B00063KGPU", "B0024NSFYO", "B00795C5X4", "B000059XTL", "B000FCW15A", "B003B1X85O", "B00005JM9Q", "B00404ME2Y", "B0006SSMWE", "B000209KMW", "B003Y5H52O", "B001B7CO0K", "6305870179", "B000F48D5A", "B004SIP75S", "B00AEFYWQY", "B006X08DZ0", "B000AM4P9A", "B000H5V8CW", "B000324Y98", "B004QIG7CW", "B0001Z3HIG", "B001725ZD2", "B001R3YRIU", "B007I8KXDQ", "B0007LXPBI", "B000B2YR92", "B00005JPO4", "B00062IVN0", "B000ICM5SU", "B0009DWL8W", "B000VAPZM2", "B003PGNBNY", "B0007LXPBS", "B006JTS6XY", "B001KX50B0", "B001NE80P4", "B002WNU0QM", "B000FVQM4W", "B002WNU0OY", "044047731X", "B001G2S3Y6", "B000Y9PC7S", "B002GOAH1U", "B001GC9VK6", "B00GOITWRE", "B0007Z9R66", "B000F2BNW2", "B000JMK6OO", "B007DBGS4G", "B00005JN0Z", "B001FCD252", "B002BIULQ2", "B004IZVMXM", "B000CDSS0Y", "B0006GAOCW", "B00005JMXO", "6305428387", "B0009HLBQQ", "B0007Z9R5W", "B00004Y7D2", "B0013ND3MK", "B00005V9I9", "B004FXQYG2", "B00FKXBECU", "B001H1I8KK", "B000LXHFNG", "B001AR012O", "B001TUZD8O", "B000065V42", "B005EJIG62", "B004FJ87EI", "B000MBUXEA", "B00ANV82HE", "B000JFY05W", "B003NHRIVQ"], "bought_together": ["B000CCBCAI", "B004CYVZ4K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001S3C0M4", "B000CCBCAI", "B00005JMCW", "B000FCW15A"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22973}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B0009JE57G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ESDWWN2SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ice Princess (Full Screen Edition)"}

{"description": "Warm Springsis a riveting, deeply moving film about a lesser-known chapter in the life of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the American president who saw his country through the dark, terrible times of the Great Depression and most of World War II.  Before those epochal events, however, Roosevelt spent time in a political wilderness, groomed for high office but struck down by polio at age 39.Warm Springsis the fascinating story of Roosevelt's painful journey from despair back to wisdom and leadership. Kenneth Branagh gives an emotionally raw, courageous performance as FDR, estranged from his wife, Eleanor (a near-luminous Cynthia Nixon), and his political guru (David Paymer) while ambivalently seeking rehabilitation at Warm Springs, a broken-down spa in the backwoods of Georgia. Mired in misery, misanthropy, and drink, Roosevelt is coaxed back to civilized behavior and a glimmer of altruism by the spa's ailing, folksy manager, Tom Loyless (a remarkable Tim Blake Nelson), and the ministrations of a progressive-minded, physical therapist (solid work by Kathy Bates). Word of Roosevelt's improvement in the buoyant, mineral-rich waters of Warm Springs draws other polio victims--some of whom endure terrible discrimination and misery while traveling&#x97;to the spa. In time, these hopeful, all-ages paraplegics form a community that inspires a sense of mission in Roosevelt, setting the stage for his return to the political arena. Surehanded, 80-year-old veteran director Joseph Sargent (on a roll following his lovely, 2004 cable movieSomething the Lord Made) has made a pitch-perfect and intimate, historical drama one never wants to see end.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000ND91S6", "B002BFCMNA", "B002CWKTUA", "B00CLH08KC", "B00DDY45DI", "B000KJTG0G", "B002AMUDJY", "B00CKZUZSU", "B0001US6CI", "B00B4ZN3XQ", "B000BITUWK", "B00028G75C", "B0088FS286", "B001KGDNAW", "B0002I833Q", "B00005YUO1", "B00008W2OX", "B000BITUWA", "B004Z2ECX0", "B0013NAML0", "B00005JXI7", "B004YDSNMQ", "B005VUTRGW", "B001BSBC16", "B00000IQC0", "B003N9ASF2", "B004H9YNLW", "B00005N5S2", "B00B4ZN4VC", "B00BTYJYP8", "B000AYELAQ", "B00005J760", "B009OE2O70", "B0054DPLUC", "B005DL6P8C", "B001AMHNKW", "0230619142", "B0095ZIHZ6", "B00JKJ0XJU", "B00005B6OY", "B00CZB9BE8", "B001MVWFAO", "B0007LFPJ8", "B0006Q93H4", "B0007WFUGK", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B00007GZYC", "B008XAT0YQ", "B0000694XY", "B000CEXEWA", "B00EO10IEE", "B0006Z2L9W", "B0006U5V9E", "B000WGWQG8", "B00AZMFO6I", "B000089QEK", "B000BNX4N6", "B00067BCBI", "1400064422", "B0040Y5K2U", "B00DL48BM6", "B000KB48NE", "B004XYOQU4", "B00DHSDMPC", "B00009WVSV", "0783227973", "B004GDB75E", "B009AMANBA", "B000BITUJS", "B00HUAH14Q", "B00J5LXT44", "B002WBYDR6", "B00AIZ2K78", "B000NTM9ZW", "B000TLTCPO", "B00J4LMHMK", "B0009S4IE2", "B007KAUWO2", "B0006SSQ3O", "B00005JMLR", "B0001NBNGQ", "B00D2CYU2W", "B00FOLGW48", "B00DGCIZD8", "B000BYRCG0", "B0080QOL10", "B00003M5G9", "B000EOTELI", "B000MEYJHY", "B00B4TAXXK", "B001B1Q2UO", "B00028G6H6", "B00GJT2OWS", "B000EHSVSC", "B000LAZE8C", "0812970497", "B00026L9CU", "B0009P42U0", "B000742G6U", "B000BYRCFQ"], "bought_together": ["B002CWKTUA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00B4ZN3XQ", "B002CWKTUA", "B002BFCMNA", "B000KJTG0G"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 128555}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0009UVBI6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AKhY-do2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Warm Springs"}

{"description": "Cynics have suggested that death is a shrewd career move for some artists, and when it comes to singer-songwriter Gram Parsons, whose life, work, and demise are chronicled inFallen Angel, they may be right. Although undeniably talented, Parsons never had a hit and made just six albums, and only one of them (the Flying Burrito Brothers'The Gilded Palace of Sin) is a bona fide classic. That's one reviewer's opinion, anyway. Yet three decades after he died (in 1975, at age 26), Parsons is revered as a country rock pioneer, a significant influence on Keith Richards and the Rolling Stones, and a colossal talent who never got his due. While that may all be true, what's beyond dispute (and it's confirmed by the great majority of those interviewed in director Gandulf Henning's documentary) is that Parsons was a screw-up, a drunk and drug abuser who squandered his opportunities and dug himself an early grave, even by rock star standards. It wasn't all his fault. Any kid with a family background like his (his father committed suicide and his mother died from the ravages of alcoholism&#x85; possibly with the assistance of her second husband, Parsons' stepfather, who was a big drinker himself) is bound to have, shall we say, issues; Parsons was also well off financially, a fact that many interviewees (most notably Chris Hillman, who played with him in the Byrds and the Burritos) suggest might have attributed to his lack of driving ambition. Richards, duet partner Emmylou Harris, and other former bandmates are on hand to tell the tale, along with his widow, various surviving relatives, and close friends and associates. There's lots of Parsons' music on the soundtrack, as well as excerpts from a couple of Burritos promo films and some interesting footage of him singing with Harris. In the end, the film's most haunting moments concern the events that followed Parsons' death, when road manager Phil Kaufman commandeered (stole, actually) his casket and drove it to California's Joshua Tree National Monument, where he set it on fire, apparently according to the singer's wishes. Nowthatis the stuff of legend.--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000002LKH", "0813042046", "B0000033ZC", "0345503368", "B000024R2P", "B0000C0FHP", "B000026GYF", "B000777I74", "B0002V7SO8", "B00000JMXD", "B000W1V8DU", "B0009CTUSW", "B00013BN4S", "0375505709", "B00013BN5C", "0312194641", "B00004ST4S", "B00063MC48", "1888580313", "1906002169", "B000056IAI", "B00701QUQU", "067170513X", "B00005BC89", "B00013BN52", "B000CNF80W", "B0012GMZUY", "0670025631", "1560256737", "B00E5MIMHW", "B00KBEY2Q8", "B009186JYI", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B00I9UEH7U", "B000O5905C", "B0018PH3OC", "B00DNJ99F2", "B008HFS4XU", "B00004YZFR", "B00FZRMIYY", "B005ALQUNK", "B0034BBB2S", "B003GCMX5Y", "B00AKV1K9O", "B000P0J060", "0956642039", "B003XMKMZU", "B004J2FJCO", "B00701QS26", "1596916141", "B005FLX39Y", "1575609541", "B005OGYH9A", "1556525893", "0306821311", "B00004OCEN", "B000P6R9TO", "B00BSBUZPK", "B000002IAZ", "B00KBEY2ZE", "B00B7VPKMY", "B00DW5IM9Q", "B00BAO98Z8", "B009KFJ05C", "B003RIBQNM", "B00004WZOJ", "B0012GMUTU", "B0009NR7YU", "B00DZP1BVO", "B004XKI9QU", "B000003IWM", "B00BQTLVWK", "B00FCFX6OK", "B009DVKU2K", "B001IHJ988", "B007TJ0T4M", "0916003019", "B000001BLC", "B00000DRVM", "B000SQLC1W", "B000066JEC", "B0000059PE", "B001A7075K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000002LKH", "0345503368", "B0002V7SO8", "B000024R2P"]}, "price": 11.51, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Vocal Pop"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock", "Country Rock"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 172832}, "asin": "B000A0GY32", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ndsY5h0aL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gram Parsons: Fallen Angel"}
{"description": "Movie studios, by and large, avoid controversial subjects like race the way you might avoid a hive of angry bees. So it's remarkable thatCrasheven got made; that it's a rich, intelligent, and moving exploration of the interlocking lives of a dozen Los Angeles residents--black, white, latino, Asian, and Persian--is downright amazing. A politically nervous district attorney (Brendan Fraser) and his high-strung wife (Sandra Bullock, biting into a welcome change of pace fromMiss Congeniality) get car-jacked by an oddly sociological pair of young black men (Larenz Tate and Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges); a rich black T.V. director (Terrence Howard) and his wife (Thandie Newton) get pulled over by a white racist cop (Matt Dillon) and his reluctant partner (Ryan Phillipe); a detective (Don Cheadle) and his Latina partner and lover (Jennifer Esposito) investigate a white cop who shot a black cop--these are only three of the interlocking stories that reach up and down class lines. Writer/director Paul Haggis (who wrote the screenplay forMillion Dollar Baby) spins every character in unpredictable directions, refusing to let anyone sink into a stereotype. The cast--ranging from the famous names above to lesser-known but just as capable actors like Michael Pena (Buffalo Soldiers) and Loretta Devine (Woman Thou Art Loosed)--meets the strong script head-on, delivering galvanizing performances in short vignettes, brief glimpses that build with gut-wrenching force.

{"description": "The teaming of Johnny Knoxville (Jackass: The Movie) and Seann William Scott (Dude, Where's My Car?) as well as the presence of the '70s-flavored car chases that were a specialty of the TV series guarantees thatThe Dukes of Hazzardwill be even more lowbrow than the CBS TV series (1979-85) that inspired it. However, this brain-damaging comedy is more \"rehash\" than \"remake,\" as good ol' Georgia boys Luke Duke (Knoxville) and his cousin Bo (Scott) are frequently upstaged by the General Lee, the Confederate-flagged '69 Charger that they drive, jump, race, and fly in as they smuggle moonshine for their Uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson). Meanwhile, cousin Daisy Duke (Jessica Simpson) is reliably available to model her short-shorts (aka \"Daisy Dukes\") and awesome figure (and let's face it, Simpson's talents pretty much begin and end right there), while corrupt honcho Boss Hogg (Burt Reynolds, who should know better) recruits a local NASCAR star to advance his wily scheme of converting Hazzard County into a strip mine. Director Jay Chandrasekhar (Super Troopers) manages to mine some good-natured humor from the movie's oval-track detour and a few colorful supporting players (notably Kevin Hefferman as the Duke's pal Sheev). Otherwise, consider yourself warned:The Dukes of Hazzardis shameless Hollywood product at its most forgettable, trafficking in shameless white, rural Southern stereotypes.

{"description": "With Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson as a pair of brazen wedding crashers, this buddy/romantic comedy milks a few big laughs from its foolproof premise. Under the direction of David Dobkin (who previously worked with Wilson onShanghai Knights), the movie ranges from bawdy romp to mushy romance, and that tonal identity crisis curtails the overall hilarity. But when the well-teamed costars are firing on all pistons with fast-paced dialogue and manic situations, belly laughs are delivered at a steady clip. Things get complicated when the guys infiltrate the family of the Treasury Secretary (Christopher Walken), resulting in a romantic pair-off between Vaughn and the congressman's oversexed daughter Gloria (Isla Fisher) while Wilson sincerely woos another daughter, Claire (Rachel McAdams), who's unhappily engaged to an Ivy League cheater (Bradley Cooper). Walken is more or less wasted in his role, but Jane Seymour and Henry Gibson make amusing appearances, and a surprise guest arrives late in the game for some over-the-top scene-stealing. It's all a bit uneven, but McAdams (considered by some to be \"the next Julia Roberts\") is a pure delight, and with enough laughs to make it easily recommended,Wedding Crasherswill likely find its place on DVD shelves alongside other flawed but enjoyable R-rated comedies that embrace a naughtier, nastier brand of humor with no need for apologies.--Jeff ShannonVince Vaughn's MoviesWhy We Love Rachel McAdamsOwen Wilson's MoviesThe SoundtrackThe Return of Crass ComedyThe 40-Year-Old Virgin", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFYS2M", "B000ELJAEM", "B00466HN7M", "B008R65XNS", "B00005JNZU", "B00006FMUW", "B000J4P9P8", "B002ZGW92E", "B001G5T6GW", "B000WZEZGI", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B00003CXSM", "B001TUZD8O", "B000HCPS94", "B001C0JCBA", "B0009HBPN0", "B001OD4S50", "B00005JMYI", "B00005JG6N", "B004EPZ084", "B0015I2RT8", "B00AEFYAMA", "B00AEBB8NS", "B00AEFXJS6", "B000069CF0", "B000TZJBPQ", "B00003CXO1", "B001C5LLQ4", "B0009OL7Z4", "B0007RT9M6", "B00005JMW7", "B001J9KJ4I", "B0006GANPA", "B003Y5H574", "B000BKJ762", "B000E6EHE0", "B003Y5H524", "B000ICM5X0", "B00AEFY7I2", "B002K0WBXW", "B00AEBB9K0", "B000VXWX7E", "B0013D8LHC", "B004HO6I2E", "B001DPHDB0", "B0016MOV92", "B00AEFYM2S", "B004EPZ070", "B000JJ4DNW", "B003CRM6PA", "B00BEIYMZ6", "B008R65XMO", "B00005JMX6", "B00AEBBA2C", "B004EPZ06G", "B004EPYZS0", "B003Y5H5B0", "B00024JC4E", "B0000AKCKI", "B000957O82", "B00AEFYQE2", "B00DV2MVWO", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B001L9EXTS", "B0041KKYGU", "B00AEFZ3XU", "B002U4UYZA", "B000CPH9PM", "B000EMGJAO", "B000M341QE", "B008R65XUQ", "B00005JMCT", "B001AKTZW8", "B00008WJD6", "B00AEFYSL8", "B002P413IC", "B00AEFXVW0", "B002ZG99H2", "B0000A02TZ", "B005LAII12", "B001SN78JO", "B008JFUORW", "B000LC3ICE", "B002T9H2LA", "B0051MKNRC", "B003HKN52U", "B000CCBCAS", "B00AEFYZCU", "B002ZG980U", "B00AEFY99O", "B002VWNIEA", "B0000524E5", "B004AV5GX6", "B000A343RI", "B000EMGJ7C", "B004LWZW5G", "B00AEFXDO6", "B00000K3UU", "B004SIP95G", "B0009RCPUW"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFYS2M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00466HN7M", "B001G5T6GW", "B003Y5H5B0", "B000J4P9P8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 92528}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.95, "brand": "New Line Home Video", "asin": "B000BKVQRU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z2E7093FL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wedding Crashers (R-Rated Widescreen Edition)"}

Midway through the 21st century, Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) lives in a confined indoor community after ongoing abuse of the Earth has rendered most of the planet uninhabitable. One of the only places in the outside world still capable of sustaining life is an idyllic island where citizens are chosen to live through a lottery. Or at least that's what Lincoln and his fellow citizens are taught to believe; the truth is that Lincoln, like everyone he knows, is actually a clone who is kept under wraps to provide needed organs when the person who supplied his or her DNA falls ill. When he becomes aware that his existence is a fraud, Lincoln escapes to the outside world with a fellow clone, Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson), though the powers that be are determined to see that no one gets away alive.The Islandalso stars Steve Buscemi, Djimon Hounsou, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Sean Bean.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767805712", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B0069UP2PI", "B00005JL78", "B0013PSTMC", "B004LWZW7E", "B004XQO90O", "B008JFUO36", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B00AEFXCLU", "B001GCUO02", "B0001NBNDY", "B002GIBVVG", "B00KHWSB5M", "B0018O4YT0", "B00005JLWN", "B0001CNRAM", "B002ZG98SW", "B00005JN0T", "B00K7IPFSM", "B00JPFTX5O", "B0009YA3OA", "B001CC7PLM", "B000AP04FG", "B005LAIIMG", "B005LAII8A", "B0013LL2Z2", "B002ZG980U", "B008JFUN50", "B00005JMWP", "B000EQHXNW", "B004WCTLNY", "B004EPYZOO", "B001GKJ2E8", "B007R6DJP8", "B00AEFXSLE", "B00AKGG8I2", "B000EZ908Y", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00BEIYIF0", "B0045HCJ8A", "B004LWZW4M", "B000BVM1S2", "B0067EKYAY", "B00AEBB8NI", "B001FB55HQ", "B00005JPAR", "B004LWZW42", "B001VLBDD0", "B0062P3392", "B000FS9FCG", "B008JFUPFI", "B00IKM5MIA", "B004A8ZX28", "B000056PMU", "B00005JPD0", "B005COLETU", "B003Q6D2B4", "B004EPYZSK", "B000P0J0EW", "B009AMAJPA", "B002SG7Z7A", "B00H83EUQW", "B000LC55F2", "B00DWZHTOU", "B005NKIPUY", "B005LAIHPE", "B000A2IPQY", "B00AEBB89W", "B0051MKNV8", "B005LAIIPS", "B001EAWMGA", "B00A7MSQRK", "6304711891", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B002GHHHOC", "B0021L8V0M", "B000P0I4O4", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AS1Q93S", "B00004XPPG", "B0045HCJFS", "B003UYUQZW", "B001OQCVI8", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00096S49Y", "B005LAIGRS", "B000EGDB10", "B002ZG984Q", "B000FGGE68", "B003L20IG0", "B0036TGSR6", "B0045HCJGC", "B002DU39GW", "B0002KVUKM", "B008JFUQZ2", "B000H30B2C", "0767803434", "B00AEBB8QK"], "bought_together": ["0767805712", "B0069UP2PI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004WCTLNY", "B004XQO90O", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B004SBQAN8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 95555}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.44, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B000BO0LH2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5133H8SZ04L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Island"}

Drake and Josh anticipate 10 days of doing exactly what they want when their parents leave town for a cruise and their sister Megan heads for Colorado to see a friend.  Unfortunately, Drake and Josh mistakenly put Megan on a flight bound for Los Angeles and then feel compelled to jump on the next flight to try to catch her.  After an eventful flight, the pair tracks her down at an exclusive hotel, manages to worm their way into a live-feed concert opportunity for Drake's band on MTV's hot \"TRL\"  television program, and somehow finds themselves mixed up in a money-printing scam that endangers both Drake's and Josh's life.  Can a couple of teenagers and their little sister outsmart these seasoned crooks and manage to get to the studio in time for Drake's all-important band gig?

Maggie is a party girl who barely graduated from high school, recycles jobs as quickly as yesterday's newspapers and believes her biggest asset is her attractiveness to the opposite sex. Rose is a Princeton educated attorney at a top law firm in Philadelphia. Her low self-esteem regarding her physical appearance has left her dating life non-existent. Rose's one joy in life is shoes (because they always fit), but unfortunately she has few social opportunities to remove them from her closet. After a calamitous falling out, the two sisters travel a bumpy road toward true appreciation for one another--aided along the way by the discovery of the maternal grandmother they thought was dead.

{"description": "A hilarious comedy about frustrated waiters, stingy tippers and dicey food, Lions Gate Films' WAITING... stars Ryan Reynolds, Anna Faris and Justin Long as young employees battling boredom at Shenanigan's, a generic chain restaurant. A waiter for four years since high school, Dean (Justin Long) has never questioned his job at Shenanigan's. But when he learns that Chett, a high school classmate, now has a lucrative career in electrical engineering, he's thrown into turmoil about his dead-end life. Dean's friend Monty (Ryan Reynolds) is in exactly the same boat, but he couldn't care less. More concerned with partying and getting laid, Monty is put in charge of training Mitch (John Francis Daley), a shy new employee.  Over the course of one chaotic shift, Mitch gets to know the rest of Shenanigan's quirky staff: Monty's tough-talking ex-girlfriend, Serena (Anna Faris), Shenanigan's over-zealous manager, Dan (David Koechner), and head cook Raddimus (Luis Guzman), who's obsessed with a senseless staff-wide competition known only as \"The Game\"...  Featuring crazy busboys, unsanitary kitchen antics, and lots of talk about sex, WAITING... is a hysterical, behind-the-scenes look at the restaurant industry, and an affectionate ode to those lost, and thoroughly unproductive, days of youth.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001MFNB58", "B000EMGJAO", "B000069CF0", "B000LC3ICE", "B000E6EHE0", "B00363WGBO", "B000JJ4DNW", "B000IZJZIU", "B000WZEZGI", "B0023TCWE8", "B000I0RNVQ", "B00AEFYS2M", "B001J9KJ4I", "B000AP04L0", "B001L9EXTS", "B000Y7U93C", "B00AEFZ3XU", "B001OD4S50", "B00AEFXVW0", "B00007AJGM", "B00005JNZU", "B0002V7TMY", "B000031WD9", "B000YW8RN6", "B00260HH1W", "B0016MJ6GA", "B0009P42WI", "B000063RQO", "B00005JKMN", "B002ZG97XI", "B0017JHQPK", "B000BKVQS4", "B004HO6I2E", "B0007DFJ0G", "B004SIP6LS", "B001G5T6GW", "B000M9CB4W", "B00000FA91", "B00005JMX6", "B00005V9HR", "0783230338", "B004SIP8ES", "B00AEFXIUK", "B00029RTAI", "B0009HBPN0", "B001O0TWYK", "B000K7VHOG", "B001KKU9DW", "6301964160", "B00860YIJU", "B000EGDBZ6", "630529142X", "B000J4P9P8", "B000WCN8QE", "B004I9SJH0", "B00005JMYI", "B00AEFY854", "B00003CXPS", "B00AEFYZCU", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B007D0FUTG", "B003Y5H5B0", "B000O77SF4", "B002FU8IWU", "B003PIUINS", "B00003CXWV", "B002IKIHEG", "B004SIP95G", "B008R65XNS", "B002T4GWWA", "B00AEFYAMA", "B0068MNO2U", "B000MCH5RM", "B000BO0L90", "B002ZGW92E", "B005LAIH9A", "B000G0O5I2", "0790729997", "B004EPZ084", "B00009W5F2", "B000N3SU92", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00008WJD6", "B004SEUJO6", "6305222908", "B00DW5IKYS", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B0026BXHQ0", "B00AEBBA2C", "B000OYC7BW", "B002ZG98B4", "B000FKO5QK", "B00029RTCG", "B000TZJBPQ", "B000031EFY", "B0016Q2D66", "B00AG4714S", "B0006HBZEW", "0800141687", "B00441GYVK"], "bought_together": ["B001MFNB58", "B000EMGJAO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00E8RKHWW", "B000AP04L0", "B004SEUIW4", "B000EMGJAO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 11312}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.21, "brand": "Vidmark/Trimark", "asin": "B000CPH9PM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TJVHXCPGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Waiting...

{"description": "On the surface, David Cronenberg may seem an unlikely candidate to directA History of Violence, but dig deeper and you'll see that he's the right man for the job. As an intellectual seeker of meaning and an avowed believer in Darwinian survival of the fittest, Cronenberg knows that the story of mild-mannered small-town diner proprietor Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) is in fact a multilayered examination of inbred human behavior, beginning when Tom's skillful killing of two would-be robbers draws unwanted attention to his idyllic family life in rural Indiana. He's got a loving wife (Maria Bello) and young daughter (Heidi Hayes) who are about to learn things about Tom they hadn't suspected, and a teenage son (Ashton Holmes) who has inherited his father's most prominent survival trait, manifesting itself in ways he never expected. By the time Tom has come into contact with a scarred villain (Ed Harris) and connections that lead him to a half-crazy kingpin (William Hurt, in a spectacular cameo), Cronenberg has plumbed the dark depths of human nature so skillfully thatA History of Violencestands well above the graphic novel that inspired it (indeed, Cronenberg was unaware of the source material behind Josh Olson's chilling adaptation). With hard-hitting violence that's as sudden as it is graphically authentic, this isA History of Violencethat's worthy of serious study and widespread acclaim.--Jeff ShannonOn the DVDOn a single disc and with little fanfare, this DVD makes an excellent case for the best extras of the year. Dive into the one-hour-long documentary and learn more about moviemaking than on many a double-disc. The secret lies in director David Cronenberg's (and his usual crew) folksy casualness in showing off the craft, be it makeup (green screens were used), directing (Cronenberg doesn't storyboard), or art direction (the diner set). It also is very funny to hear about \"fish Fridays\" and how Maria Bello's Uncle Pete became an influence. Even the infamous sex-on-the-staircase scene is diagnosed with candor as stars Viggo Mortensen and Bello act as if there is no backstage camera. There's only one deleted scene, but it's uncommonly deconstructed on why it was filmed and why it was cut (it's a very Cronenbergian dream sequence). A short bit on Cannes is also a delight. So much is here that Cronenberg's smart commentary track is nearly superfluous.

{"description": "Immoral, politically incorrect, and fiercely funny,Action: The Complete Seriesis a timeless comedy focusing on a group of Hollywood insiders whose moral compass has spun out of control. Led by uber-producer Peter Dragon (Jay Mohr), the series' first and only season ferociously lampoons the sleaziness of modern-day Hollywood. Dragon--seemingly the separated-at-birth brother of slimy uber-agent Bob Sugar (also played by Mohr) fromJerry Maguire--is a jerk who pretends to be gay when it's convenient and doesn't understand why Salma Hayek (playing herself) would slap him silly for making inappropriate suggestions during an earlier audition.  In Dragon's lair, sexual harassment is an inconvenience, the screenwriter is an afterthought, and a movie isn't a film unless it's got mega-explosions.  Mohr and Illeana Douglas (portraying an ex-child star turned prostitute turned studio executive) are a joy to watch. When a sycophantic colleague accuses Dragon of promoting a hooker over him, he calmly says, \"She's my prostitute. You're my whore.\"  A subtle difference, yes, but one that makes a world of difference in Hollywood. If there's a plus side to this topnotch series being canceled in 1999, it's that the writers didn't have time to let the show disintegrate into hackneyed clich&#xE9;s. There is no warm-hearted parable to justify the nasty means--just a lot of quick-witted dialogue and an excellent ensemble cast that makes viewers enjoy the characters despite (or should that bebecause of?) their numerous flaws.--Jae-Ha Kim", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002W1HBIO", "B000E33VYU", "B00KYCA4QY", "B00HZMZ286", "B00K8HAIAW", "B00GT2TEPU", "B00IJZW35I", "B001QE99BA", "B00JK47BHM", "B0081QF6Q8", "B008L0YMWS", "B000MTEFVE", "B0051GOB2G", "B00BQK4Y7S", "B00FPUN57K", "B0062KMDWU", "B00HZVX1C6", "B000FL7CB4", "B0025KVKDO", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B002C3GTLC", "B00275EDYA", "B0016BWAE6", "161696121X", "B00HRCBGRA", "B006VC3LDO", "B000A6T1KY", "B0030VANJO", "B00CPR3RB0", "B00I099JY6", "B00DNQCH0Y", "B00I099JWI", "B000H7JCFK", "B000F48D7I", "B0002PYSB0", "B00J2PQZEY", "B00GZP0MI4", "B0083XXWRE", "1401308015", "B0006UEVUE", "0425269027", "B0055SNHQ6", "B00CYQXH4O", "B004RCLTAM", "B00008EY6Q", "B009CI8S6Y", "B0007N1AM2", "B00D4C5GXC", "B000E3L7F0", "B000FUTVPA", "B0007TKHKC", "B00E8AVNAE", "B00005JM3A", "B0006GAO18", "B000N3T0EG", "B000BT96OG", "B0015ET3YO", "B0056GLNQI", "B000FJH5M2", "B00H7KJTCG", "B00BGI08GG", "B000GPIPTM", "B00E3V9N1E", "B003PGNBO8", "0792841409", "B001AQO43M", "B002WC89WK", "B00F1FVMUQ", "B00BGI07NK", "B001CQONOA", "B0068FZ0O2", "B000CQQID0", "B000EQ45BU", "B0089N2ZH6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002W1HBIO", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B0056GLNQI", "B003L20IG0"]}, "price": 6.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 144105}, "asin": "B000CQQI8K", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B0BWTGGGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Action: The Complete Series"}

{"description": "The latest entry in theHarry Pottersaga could be retitledFast Times at Hogwarts, where finding a date to the winter ball is nearly as terrifying as worrying about Lord Voldemort's return. Thus, the young wizards' entry into puberty (and discovery of the opposite sex) opens up a rich mining field to balance out the dark content in the fourth movie (and the stories are only going to get darker). Mike Newell (Four Weddings and a Funeral) handily takes the directing reins and eases his young cast through awkward growth spurts into true young actors. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe, more sure of himself) has his first girl crush on fellow student Cho Chang (Katie Leung), and has his first big fight with best bud Ron (Rupert Grint). Meanwhile, Ron's underlying romantic tension with Hermione (Emma Watson) comes to a head over the winter ball, and when she makes one of those girl-into-woman Cinderella entrances, the boys' reactions indicate they've all crossed a threshold.But don't worry, there's plenty of wizardry and action inGoblet of Fire. When the deadly Triwizard Tournament is hosted by Hogwarts, Harry finds his name mysteriously submitted (and chosen) to compete against wizards from two neighboring academies, as well as another Hogwarts student. The competition scenes are magnificently shot, with much-improved CGI effects (particularly the underwater challenge). And the climactic confrontation with Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes, in a brilliant bit of casting) is the most thrilling yet.Goblet, the first installment to get a PG-13 rating, contains some violence as well as disturbing images for kids and some barely shrouded references at sexual awakening (Harry's bath scene in particular). The 2 1/2-hour film, lean considering it came from a 734-page book, trims out subplots about house-elves (they're not missed) and gives little screen time to the standard crew of the otherPotterfilms, but adds in more of Britain's finest actors to the cast, such as Brendan Gleeson as Mad-Eye Moody and Miranda Richardson as Rita Skeeter.

{"description": "\"Why do we put up with this bloody climate?\" moans Larry Durrell during the rainy prelude to this Masterpiece Theater presentation. It's 1935 and 12-year-old Gerald (Eugene Simon,Casanova) is living with his family in Bournemouth. His father passed away years ago. Much like Judi Dench inMrs. Henderson Presents, his mother (Imelda Staunton,Vera Drake) sees widowhood as a chance to make a fresh start. On Larry's advice, she decides to relocate the brood to sunny Corfu (now Kerkira), so off to Greece they go: Mother, nature-obsessed Gerry, boy-crazy Margot (Tamzin Merchant), gun-happy Leslie (Russell Tovey), and literature-loving Larry (Matthew Goode,Match Point). Minutes after their arrival, a burly fellow named Spiro (Iranian comedian Omid Djalili,Gladiator) takes the quintet under his wing and finds them a roomy villa. Soon Gerald is collecting every manner of animal: turtles, rose beetles, rabbits. The other Durrells embark on adventures of their own, brassy jazz-pop punctuating their every move. Previously produced as a 1987 miniseries by the BBC, this fanciful film boils Durrell's enduring memoir down to a brisk 90 minutes. The structure may be episodic, but the attention to detail--the exotic fauna, the evocative costumes--is praiseworthy. As Gerry notes about his creatures, \"They're just like us, aren't they--families. I want to know how they all work. Imagine if they weren't there?\" While Gerald would go on to become a naturalist, brother Lawrence would find also fame withThe Alexandria Quartet.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins--a pair of actresses who hated each other--re-mix their chemistry fromThe Old MaidinOld Acquaintance, an entertaining adaptation of John Van Druten's play. The action begins with Davis, a semi-famous author, returning to her small town and the home of old friend Hopkins. The later has opted for the settled life of husband and pregnancy, and she doesn't much hide her envy of Davis's success. Then the tables turn, as Hopkins pens a series of potboilers that sell much better than her friend-rival's. The movie keeps checking up on these two as the years pass, each wanting what the other has. It kicks around such staples as career vs. family, but what comes across most memorably inOld Acquaintanceis the friendship between the two characters despite their rivalry; in that sense, the best scene in the film is the last scene. Hopkins has the flashy role, a silly ninny who seemingly never stops screeching, and Davis takes the more centered, self-effacing part. (By the way, Davis said that a scene in which she wears men's pajama tops caused a bit of a vogue at the time.) The men are in the background, although John Loder does a nice job of layering a gentle humor to Hopkins' long-suffering husband. Gig Young, in one of his earliest roles, is almost unrecognizable as a Davis paramour.

{"description": "Arrested Development--one of the greatest comedies in the history of television--went out in a blaze of glory. The truncated final season packed more biting humor per minute than ever before. In only 13 episodes, dozens of intertwining storylines spun in all directions: In addition to the overarching story about the fractious infighting of the Bluth family and the family's housing development company being investigated for treason in Iraq (a plot arc that comes to a dazzlingly surreal conclusion), the put-upon \"good son\" Michael Bluth (Jason Bateman,Teen Wolf Too) pursues romance with a lovely British woman (Charlize Theron,Monster) who turns out to be woefully inappropriate; swaggering magician Gob (Will Arnett,Monster-In-Law) flees from his newly-discovered teenage son while still pandering for the affection of his self-absorbed father (Jeffrey Tambor,The Larry Sanders Show); flighty Lindsay (Portia de Rossi,Ally McBeal) and her sexually blurry husband Tobias (David Cross,Mr. Show) both get the hots for the family's new lawyer, Bob Loblaw (Scott Baio,Charles in Charge); and much, much more. It's difficult to describe what makesArrested Developmentso brilliant. The ensemble is uniformly superb (Jessica Walter, as the family's boozing, scheming matriarch, is particularly devastating this season) and the surprising guest stars (including Andy Richter, James Lipton, Justine Bateman, and many others) are perfectly cast; the characters' abominable behavior defies conventional television notions of \"likability\", yet they only grow more endearing the more you watch; the humor embraces wild slapstick and sharp satire, often within a single scene; and the nimble documentary style allows for sly glancing references to jokes and scenes from long-past episodes, rewarding devoted fans. But the key is that, no matter how screwballArrested Developmentbecomes, the show offers a rich, textured, and wonderfully coherent world in which these characters feel genuine, a world completely unlike the flat, plastic simulacrum offered by the average sitcom.Arrested Developmentwas true to itself to the end. Its followers will cherish it forever.--Bret FetzerStills from The Third Season ofArrested Development(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000A9QKRI", "B0002PYS7Y", "B00ICR6SBI", "B000RBA6CO", "B0024FAD9M", "B001B9LWME", "B000RW3VDE", "B002DPPH6W", "B0018RKEQE", "B002N5N5KW", "B001L1S1PS", "B0053O8ACS", "B000FFJYE8", "B0002W4P98", "B003L77GE2", "B000SINT4S", "B009LDD40U", "B002N5N5PM", "B00GSW3EQG", "B000GETTKM", "B00008YGRS", "B001YYQA0K", "B0024FAD9W", "B002N5N5SO", "B00005JNEQ", "B00BI7ZAM2", "B000AJJNI6", "B0009VBTP0", "B0008JIJ1A", "B00AQ7EJ04", "B003L77GBU", "B000DZ7YN8", "B003R4ZMOA", "B003L77GDS", "B009LDCVJU", "B0058JEHTS", "B00166UFSY", "B001AEF6AY", "B000QXDJLI", "B007CO5MVE", "B003UD7JDA", "B001NOMOS8", "B0012CJQY6", "B009TE9GNK", "B002EOVX9W", "B001VPJYZ0", "B007QU37LG", "B008L0YMZA", "B00123BY6S", "B001DJLCRC", "B000NNK4DM", "B005S97V82", "B003L77GTC", "B0012CJQYG", "B0000V45YG", "B003L77GJM", "B0001I9Y8U", "B00007E8V4", "B0058YPG1G", "B002N5N5NE", "B001DPHDBU", "B000EMI6LE", "B0012CJQYQ", "B000TGURZ8", "B000Q6GUKW", "B000E6ES9O", "B00008YGRV", "B00AB65SVE", "B004YM6JSW", "B0053O8A8M", "B007ZFR67I", "B000ENUYGI", "B0032UYFA6", "B00008PHCU", "B007C8RZQ0", "B000EBGFPY", "B001RTSPVY", "B005OZIV20", "B007W58N6O", "B0007RO8MW", "B00475B0G2", "B000U1ZV1W", "B000083C6V", "B002AMVED8", "B000LC3IKG", "B000S76LKI", "B00A2XQU7M", "B0058EE6OO", "B00BTRKMNI", "B002N5N5LG", "B007KFZ7YM", "B00BT1XCOU", "B00166647K", "B001OQCVFG", "B000FL7CAU", "B0013FSL16", "B000GPIPTM", "B0053O8A78", "B0060MYKYY", "B002OOWKSU"], "bought_together": ["B000A9QKRI", "B0002PYS7Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002PYS7Y", "B000A9QKRI", "B00ICR6SBI", "B00EPH8S58"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22585}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 12.54, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B000EXDS7K", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F7EES6SHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Arrested Development: Season 3"}

It begins in chronological order withEnterprise's premiere episode, \"Broken Bow.\"  A new starship,Enterprise NX-01, is rushed into service when a Klingon crash-lands on Earth and Starfleet decides to return him to his home world.  Then skip to two episodes of the Original Series, \"Errand of Mercy\" and \"The Trouble with Tribbles,\" which focus on the conflicts between the Federation and the Klingons.  But the two factions had begun working together by the time ofThe Next Generation.  In \"A Matter of Honor,\" Riker (Jonathan Frakes) spends some time serving aboard a Klingon ship, and hisEnterpriseshipmate, Worf (Michael Dorn), delves deep into his Klingon culture along with his brother Kurn (Tony Todd) in \"Sins of the Father.\"  Then in the two-part \"Redemption,\" a bridge between the fourth and fifth seasons, the Klingon empire teeters on the brink of civil war.  Worf arrived at the space stationDeep Space Ninewhen the Klingons offer to join the Federation in the Dominion war in \"The Way of the Warrior.\"  There he remained for \"The Sword of Kahless,\" in which the search for a mythical artifact turns into a very real struggle for power.  Last areDS9's humor classic \"Trials and Tribble-ations,\" followed byVoyager's \"Barge of the Dead,\" in which B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson) has visions of the Klingon afterlife.Of all the fan collectives released so far,Star Trek Fan Collective: Klingonhas the largest number of episodes to draw from, so there will inevitably be controversy over  which episodes were selected (via fan vote).  While the two Tribble episodes are among the franchise's most popular, the Klingons are somewhat tangential characters, and \"Trials and Tribble-ations\" was previously included onStar Trek Fan Collective: Time Travel.  The space might have been better spent on the Original Series' \"Day of the Dove\" or moreTNGandDS9, though that might have turned the set intoStar Trek Fan Collective: Worf.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000ERVJJ0", "B000CCBCIA", "B001AII4RC", "B000P5FH44", "B000CSUNLQ", "B001TH16CE", "B002MU4NM2", "B00023P4F6", "B002MU4NLS", "B001TH16CO", "B00IUR3YI0", "B00005JLRT", "B005DEUEV8", "B002I9Z8EO", "B00008KA58", "B00D3XM3MY", "B002I9Z8GM", "B00H8KC1N4", "B000HEWEJ4", "B000063V8T", "B000063V8S", "B00CLA3Y2I", "B00IURL19Y", "067174559X", "B0007TKH66", "B000A6CLL0", "B002I9Z8I0", "B0017VG69U", "B0000UJL96", "B00008KA59", "B00005JKHP", "B000AOEMXC", "B00BCJR9H0", "B00GTZWZH6", "B002I9Z8G2", "B0010YVCAM", "B00005JLF5", "B001RHGRTS", "B00ISSF7S6", "B0089J2818", "B00GD9GNEY", "B006ZL1PAC", "B00HUPC5X8", "147672220X", "B0009I7NGW", "0671537555", "B0002NY81C", "B00JL6L4WC", "B000063V8R", "B00BHWG0DQ", "B0010YSD7M", "B0011FLH00", "B00005JM3A", "B00FFEM0W2", "B000062XFG", "B00008GEK4", "B000127LW2", "B00BAXTY8U", "B00CRX82LM", "B00005Y1NF", "B00DCLTFCI", "B002I9Z8BM", "B00CTSDDVO", "B000063UR1", "B002PQ7JQK", "B0006J28MS", "B0007UDCX0", "B000HT3Q2I", "B000CQM4YM", "B00H57HOSC", "B0002JP4GE", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00BD6K54G", "B002HWRYJE", "B001DHXT3Y", "B00062IDCO", "B00AEFXV3E", "B002I9Z8GW", "B000A9QKRI", "B004NJC0JI"], "bought_together": ["B000CCBCIA", "B000ERVJJ0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000CCBCIA", "B001AII4RC", "B000P5FH44", "B000CSUNLQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 110583}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 18.16, "brand": "Paramount Pictures", "asin": "B000FEBWTY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513X4RE7WRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek Fan Collective - Klingon"}
{"description": "Jack of All Trades, starring Bruce Campbell (Evil Dead) as Jack Stiles, and Angela Dotchin as his supervisor, Emilia Rothschild, is a campy, post-Revolutionary War-era comedy series that's fun because it's so bizarre. In each of the twenty-two episodes, Jack and Emilia, hired by Thomas Jefferson as undercover spies, fight French Imperialism while encountering history's greatest political celebrities. In a dynamic reminiscent ofMoonlighting, Emilia's feminist savvy for espionage is repeatedly undermined by Jack's dumb-but-sweet na&#xEF;vete. Their brains and brawn combo is unbeatable, as they continuously foil conquest plans hatched by French Governor Croque (Stuart Devenie) and his cousin, Napolean Bonaparte (Verne Troyer, a.k.a Mini Me). No one is sacred in this series: French plans for takeover are always obviously revealed in one idiotic swoop, as if the Governor and Napolean are The Joker and The Penguin in vintageBatmanepisodes. Jack, master of one-liners like, \"Beat it turkey, I&#x92;m having Thanksgiving,\" pokes fun at America's love of corny jokes. Plots, too, are ridiculous. In \"X Marquis the Spot,\" Jack and Emilia visit Marquis de Sade's \"Agony Island\" in search of King George's crown. De Sade, clad in absurd red and black leathers, forces everyone to wear leashes and engage in S&M; master/slave tactics. In \"Shark Bait,\" Jack and Emilia enjoy a submarine ride in a machine that looks like a giant, Victorian fish, when their sub is swallowed by Leonardo da Vinci's great, great, great, great grandson, Captain Nardo's bigger sub. Scripted fantasy elements commingle with slapstick humor, satire, and physical comedy in this odd show destined for cult classic status. With Sam Raimi as executive producer and Eric Gruendemann and Josh Becker, ofHerculesandXenafame, as directors,Jack of All Tradesgot that extra dose of twisted, off-color humor needed to make it a truly original show.--Trinie Dalton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000F7CMPE", "B0009JE6FM", "B001KEGR5W", "B00C6F61IW", "B00005JOJP", "B001KEGR5M", "B000AQ69QS", "B00F3L8P26", "B000WC38FA", "B000JLTRHW", "B00BHLTIXQ", "0312291450", "B00404ME2E", "B004XM38CS", "031231261X", "B000ELL1QC", "B004ZBFRG2", "B0012IX35S", "B003H9LIU2", "B006LPHY6G", "B0001LQJMQ", "B008R52LA2", "0312242646", "B003KW7CQ0", "B000BCCAEQ", "B001RXDM2M", "B000IJ7A5Q", "B000E33VZY", "B000PFUAN2", "B001C0PFG6", "B0016MJ6P6", "B00L326LTI", "B009ERK2UI", "B005NKIPUO", "B001KEGR7U", "B00AMDA2P8", "B0058I9DZM", "B00KTZALDC", "B002QU1Z1K", "B0051GOB2G", "B004EXWGJW", "B003BGZ61S", "B0011FLH00", "B003QJC208", "0312312601", "B00GTZWZH6", "B000EOTV98", "0783227434", "B000E33VZO", "B001QE99BA", "B004PQM81E", "B00E8OMZGG", "B001CQONOA", "B000N3T0EG", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B00K0D972O", "B003MX91H0", "B006LG74RE", "B003XEKUBY", "B00BCMT3TO", "B004I1K2FK", "B00GOHZLDO", "B003NH3X5Q", "B0037AGB9O", "B00170LCWC", "B00344EAQO", "B003XMKU3Y", "B000SMNL92", "B002VA59ZS", "B006LG74Q0", "B00AMDA2QC", "B004HHX9T6", "B001RXDM1I", "B0009HI5KQ", "B0063DOV2Q", "B00E5G03I4", "B00JK47BHM", "B0012EM5CY", "B000QUEQ4U", "B0060MYLCU", "B0012IXBNC", "B00B04NIZO", "B001RHGRTS", "B00IXPWGIS", "B00061QJSK", "B0006FO9B0", "B00I099JZK", "B0002MHDW4", "B00466H3CC", "B0009KQP3C", "B00466H3CW", "B007AFC0W4", "B003PGNBO8", "B00CPTUNR4", "B00BD6K54G", "B00FJX96BC", "B0000AUHQE", "B00HXH0102", "B009P3J69O", "B00IO998U2"], "bought_together": ["B000F7CMPE", "B0009JE6FM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000F7CMPE", "B00F3L8P26", "B00005JOJP", "B0009JE6FM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 11230}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.68, "brand": "CAMPBELL,BRUCE", "asin": "B000FJH5MC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511KCSD8H0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jack of All Trades - The Complete Series"}
{"description": "The second season of HBO's Depression-era gothic--John Steinbeck by way of Tod Browning--picks up where the first left off. Professor Lodz (Patrick Bauchau) is dead. Ben (Nick Stahl), the show's protagonist, appears to be the culprit. Samson (Michael J. Anderson) helps him dispose of the body. Later he tells the other carnival workers that Lodz \"took a powder.\" Lila (Debra Christofferson) doesn't buy it. Meanwhile, Sophie (Clea DuVall), who lost her mother to fire the previous year, feels unmoored without her guidance. A few states away, Brother Justin (Clancy Brown) harbors ever greater delusions of grandeur--and inappropriate thoughts about his sister, Iris (Amy Madigan). In \"Alamagordo, NM,\" he decides to establish a temple, which he dubs Jonestown, er, Jericho. At the same time, life amongst the carnies, who are heading towards Justin's California, is becoming increasingly tense. Ruthie (Adrienne Barbeau), for instance, is starting to see dead people--like Lodz--and Stumpy (Toby Huss) is no longer able to keep his gambling in check. As with the first season, the action continues to alternate between the carnival and the congregation. What binds the two is a man named Scudder (John Savage), who has connections to Ben and Justin. Although writer/creator Dan Knauf had planned to tie things up between seasons three and six, HBO did not renewCarniv&#xE0;lea second time. Nonetheless, a surprising number of questions are answered, like the identity of \"Management\" (voiced by an un-credited Linda Hunt) and whether Ben and Justin will have a final showdown. The answer to the latter question is: Yes, they will--and there&#x92;ll be casualties.--Kathleen C.

His mad quest begins after he accidentally overhears Lisa's melodic voice speaking in the phone booth next door. But before he knows it, she is gone.

{"description": "A disturbing film about a young Belgian couple and their newborn child,L'Enfanttells a heartbreaking tale that is less about love than about the possibility of moral redemption. We quickly learn what kind of people Sonia and Bruno are. Sonia (Deborah Francois) is a sweet teenager who has just given birth to Bruno's (Jeremie Renier) child. Instead of visiting her and seeing their baby in the hospital, Bruno sublets her apartment to \"friends\" who slam the door in her face when she tries to return home. We do not know what Sonia does for a living, but we know she's diligent enough to maintain a small apartment and keep her pantry stocked with instant soup. Bruno, on the other hand, refuses to take a job. Instead, he leads a gang of thieves who're approximately half his age (and height). Still, Sonia loves him. And Bruno, who may be incapable of love, enjoys the carefree benefits of having a girlfriend who doesn't expect too much. All this changes when Bruno does the unthinkable--he sells their child. He calmly explains to her, \"I thought we'd have another.\" Overnight, Sonia changes from a little girl to a bitter woman who no longer excuses Bruno's behavior. When he returns to her apartment claiming he loves her, she spits back, \"You're lying. You can't help it.\" Not realizing the irony of his own actions, he then begs her for money. Renier and Francois are formidable actors who convey feelings with subtle nuances. Though the film is in French, the viewer never feels lost. The subtitles certainly help, but the actors are so good that their intonations and expressions speak volumes themselves.L'Enfant--a 2005 Cannes winner by filmmaking brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne--is a brutal film to watch not because of any gore or violence, but because of the frailty of the characters and their desperation to survive. In his quest to return the child to Sonia, Bruno attempts to become a better human being. But the viewer is never left with the satisfaction of knowing that he will ever be able to truly redeem himself.--Jae-Ha Kim", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002U6DVOY", "B0001JXP16", "B0083V2VZ0", "B0083V2W18", "B00AIBZLHS", "B00A8QDI1Y", "B0083V2VXC", "B00HVOFP6W", "B002BWP4A6", "B00151QYE4", "B00000F7E6", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B00K0MM4AM", "B00A8QDHUQ", "B0001EFUFK", "B0000C9JFO", "B000I8OOG0", "B0087OULO6", "B00092ZLEY", "B00GPPXNLC", "B00HE010QM", "B00IGK6TH4", "B00AIBZLR8", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B00HE011DE", "B00HRJVHEK", "B00009OOFG", "B000B9EYFW", "B0083V2W54", "B004Q0CHB0", "B002AG2NTI", "B009VO9XSG", "B0084O26SI", "B000YAA68W", "B00006ADG1", "B002BWP3UC", "B0002KQOH6", "B000P6R9NK", "B0036TGTDO", "B002AFX53C", "B00002RAPT", "B00080Z53O", "B00005JKJA", "B0035ECHIG", "B003ICZW7S", "B001152TL6", "B00GPPXP6A", "B00005UK01", "B0000B1A5P", "B00002VWE0", "B0036TGSJE", "B000059TON", "B0000C2IQP", "B00023P4N8", "B0006GAOJA", "6305362688", "B00HVOFP9O", "B000PKG6O4", "0780618564", "B00HVOFP08", "B00HXH00ZI", "B00005N8A9", "B0007OCG5G", "B0041KKYF6", "B001MPS7GG", "B004SUDQ22", "B00003CXKS", "B000296E7W", "B005MXQD74", "B00HB3AP9A", "0767812158", "B002E2M5IC", "6305744114", "0671604295", "B00005J75R", "B00AZNEVNE", "B00GPPXNIK", "B000OVLBGC", "B000I8OMEY", "B00FGVRZOM", "B0002DB52M", "B00007J5VT", "B00005JL57", "B00009MEA0", "B0029O0BK4", "B0077E8RFC", "B00GA9F2PI", "B00421IR5I", "B001QFYCZM", "B00FGVRZR4", "0231163290", "B008CJ0JS4", "B000A5044C", "B00004TBFS", "B00005M2C7", "6305081034", "B0054QHHHE", "B006TTC5MM", "B001EOQCMG"], "bought_together": ["B002U6DVOY", "B0001JXP16"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00A8QDI1Y", "B001THZAAI", "B0083V2W18", "B00151QYE4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 123246}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.99, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000G0O5IM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519ND3S0K4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "L'enfant (The Child)"}

{"description": "There's never been, and never will be, another comedy likePlaytime. Three years in the making, French comedy master Jacques Tati's 1967 classic was an epic, experimental undertaking of unprecedented scale: Requiring the lavish construction of three entire city blocks of ultra-modern buildings, it was the most expensive French film up to that time, financially ruined its creator, baffled many viewers and critics when it was finally released after numerous delays, and is now regarded as Tati's undisputed masterpiece. Once again, Tati plays his comedic alter ego, the hapless M. Hulot (first seen in 1953'sMr. Hulot's Holiday), seen here as a befuddled pawn on a gigantic chessboard (metaphorically speaking) of modern conformity. He's simply trying to get to an appointment, but in the film's astonishing mock-Parisian landscape of antiseptic steel, glass, and plastic, Tati's resonant theme of contemporary confusion is fully expressed through meticulous use of framing and space--so effectively, in fact, that critic Jonathan Rosenbaum (in an accompanying essay) suggests that the film's dazzling \"Royal Garden\" sequence \"may be the most formidable example of mise-en-sc&egrave;ne in the history of cinema.\" With M. Hulot taking a back-seat to the film's breathtaking accumulation of visual details,Playtime(or, if you prefer,Play Time) rewards multiple viewings, revealing something new every time in its widescreen canvas of subtle gags and delirious eccentricity. Although journalist Art Buchwald provided English dialogue for the film,Playtimebears closer kinship to silent comedy, with universal humor and a musical soundtrack that's as essential as any of the visuals. Tati (1908-1982) never recovered from the film's financial failure, but happily, he lived long enough to seePlaytimereceive its much-deserved critical re-appraisal.--Jeff ShannonStills fromPlaytime(Click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005A8TU", "B00005A8TV", "B00180R05O", "B003UESJII", "B0007SMDCS", "B000OPPADS", "B0000BUZKP", "B00HE010QM", "B001CW7ZSA", "B00005JKPT", "6305744114", "B00005QAPJ", "B008CJ0JS4", "B0000633SC", "0870708899", "B0001ZIYDO", "B000I8OOG0", "B0012Z361M", "B000025RE7", "B00AQ6J6H6", "6305081034", "B004M66YUS", "B00092ZLEY", "B00FGVRZR4", "0780022629", "6305257450", "B00GPPXNIK", "B000E5LEV0", "B0002V7O0Q", "B00005AUKD", "B00005NC66", "0780021541", "B00065GX64", "B000FILVNM", "B00000IOKV", "B00K5EJHGO", "B005HK13S6", "B00003CWTI", "B000065V38", "B002U6DVQ2", "B004WPYO7E", "B0068CEH12", "B00005B1ZK", "B000093NQZ", "B000093NR0", "B001LMU1C8", "B000C8Q900", "B00005EBSB", "B00005Y727", "B00005QAPH", "B000YAA68W", "B009VO9XSG", "B002PAD2S0", "B000244F2S", "B00GRA7M2G", "B000EOTWIS", "B00AQ6J64O", "B000TXNDV6", "B001D8W7EU", "B004ALIG4M", "B005152C7S", "B000A5044C", "B00004XQMY", "B000063K2Q", "0780022343", "1559409053", "B000A0GOF0", "B003V5EH6E", "B00005PJ8T", "B000ZM1MIM", "B004WPYO6U", "B0035ECHIG", "B00AEFY9GW", "B003SEH3EQ", "0062026151", "B00005JKGO", "B00023P4N8", "B00000F7E6", "B002E01MBA", "B000BB14IA", "B000UJ48SQ", "B00005B1ZM", "B000K0YLX2", "B0009S4IJW", "B00A3IOY8S", "0374289204", "B002AFX53C", "B000NOK0HG", "B0047P5FSQ", "B002C8YSDI", "B0001IN0MQ", "B000FUF7CQ", "B001WLMOHI", "B002945DUW", "B00004Z1FM", "B00AQ6J5JU", "B00AEBB89C", "0816616779", "B00AQ6J3AG"], "bought_together": ["B00005A8TV"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005A8TV", "B00005A8TU", "B004WPYO7E", "B00LUSUVB4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 80248}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 76.99, "brand": "Image Entertainment", "asin": "B000G8NXZ0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y3A1SBFQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Playtime (The Criterion Collection)"}

{"description": "\"We must own crisis and we must brand crisis.\" So says advertising consultant Tad Devine in this insightful documentary. Along with James Carville, Jeremy Rosner, and other Greenberg Carville Shrum (GCS) pollsters and strategists, he's helping to shape the campaign of Bolivian presidential candidate Gonzalo \"Goni\" S&#xE1;nchez de Lozada of the MNR Party (Goni first held office from 1993-1997). That was in 2002. As with most American elections, things start off on a positive note and soon turn negative as the \"crisis\" changes from the economy to the competition, Evo Morales (the MAS Party) and Manfred Reyes Villa (the NFR Party). Goni's own campaign manager believes that his age and perceived \"arrogance\" are stumbling blocks (and possibly the cigar-smoking millionaire's wealth, since only the very rich can afford GCS). Rachel Boynton's debut feature tracks the process from start to finish: 100+ days of brainstorming sessions, focus groups, and television appearances. It'sThe War Room, Part II: The Bolivian Years. Unfortunately, Bolivia is not America and Goni is not Bill Clinton. The violent anti-government riots that break out in 2003, as the country's economy remains in tatters, bring to mind the old saw, \"Be careful what you wish for...\" In the end, it's easy to demonize GCS, but Boynton doesn't point fingers--with a true populist like Clinton, their plan just might have worked.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Predator:RambomeetsAlienin this terrific science-fiction thriller from 1987, directed by John McTiernan just a year beforeDie Hardmade him Hollywood's most sought-after director of action-packed blockbusters. Arnold Schwarzenegger leads an elite squad of U.S. Army commandos to a remote region of South American jungle, where they've been assigned to search for South American officials who've been kidnapped by terrorists. Instead they find a bunch of skinned corpses hanging from the trees and realize that they're now facing a mysterious and much deadlier threat. As the squad is picked off one by one, Arnold finds himself pitted against a hideous alien creature that's heavily armed and wearing a spacesuit enabling the creature to render itself invisible. The title says it all in describing the relentless, escalating action that follows, maintained by McTiernan with an abundance of visual flair. The film's special effects are still impressive, and stunning locations in the Mexican jungles create a combined atmosphere of verdant beauty and imminent danger. The plot doesn't hold up to much scrutiny, but the movie's so exciting and tightly paced that its weaknesses seem irrelevant. --Jeff ShannonPredator 2:Predatorwreaked havoc in the jungle and struck box-office gold, so Hollywood logic dictated thatPredator 2should raise hell in the big, bad city. Los Angeles, to be specific, and this near-future L.A. (circa 1997) is an ultra-violent playground for the invisibility-cloaked alien that hunted Arnold Schwarzenegger in the previous film. Scant explanation is given for the creature's return, and because Ah-nuld was busy makingTotal Recall, Danny Glover was awkwardly installed as the maverick cop (is there any other kind?) who defies a government goon (Gary Busey) to curtail the alien's inner-city killing spree. But why bother, when the victims are scummy Colombian drug lords? Don't look for intelligent answers; director Stephen Hopkins favors wall-to-wall action over sensible plotting, allowing Stan Winston's more prominently featured Predator to join the ranks of iconic movie monsters. And anticipatingAlien vs. Predatorin comic books and in theaters, there's a familiar-looking skull in the Predator's trophy case! --Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002ZG98LO", "B001451HXO", "B0000VCZK2", "B001451HX4", "B00005N5S5", "B001VLBDD0", "B00005JMZK", "B000REQQGQ", "B00000ILDG", "B005COLETU", "B000U1ZV8K", "B0004Z33G4", "B000BPL2FQ", "B00AKGG828", "B00070FX5U", "B005LAIHXQ", "B0002CHK1S", "B00000ILDF", "B0057RCFQS", "B002GSXKNI", "B00FWXMSDW", "B000JYW5BE", "B000RW3VCK", "B001AK3S4Y", "B00000ILDH", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B005PTYP70", "B0000VD12I", "B0015XHP2C", "B004EPYZUS", "B000056PMU", "B00001ZWUS", "B00005R2IS", "B001DJLD1M", "B00GDDNFDW", "079284646X", "B00000G3PA", "0783225946", "B00008G8M4", "B001TK80C0", "B0050MB5NO", "B000RJO56E", "B001HQZJMU", "B00000IQVQ", "B00004STDN", "B00DTPRZ24", "B00026ZG10", "B001B3LIOC", "B00005JKYX", "B006W4KVI4", "B0015XHP4A", "B008874968", "B000MGBLSC", "B000U1ZV6C", "B0009RCPY8", "0783228686", "B000U1ZV4Y", "6305767866", "B00006RCOC", "B001B8XRT6", "B001F7MSFM", "B00111YM5Q", "B003XURDAY", "B006VRRGNK", "B00008G8M5", "0783226837", "B002DPVI0Q", "B00H1RMWYW", "B00006JDVV", "B000FOPPEM", "B000NA1WGS", "B004P7CMOQ", "B000A9QK9Q", "B0006HBZYC", "B000WC389G", "B0009W5JR8", "B0002J58HO", "B008JFUNKU", "B006ZL1P66", "0767802519", "B001DJLD0S", "B009WGYXIS", "B002GHHHL0", "B002Z7FWBI", "B001GCUO1Q", "B0004Z33EG", "B009MO57H6", "B00AEFY5B6", "B001FOK70S", "B00005JL3K", "6304806434", "B00005N5RM", "B000V4UFZK", "B005LAII44", "B00005JA8B", "0783114885", "B0067QPVJ6", "B003PIUINS", "B004EI2NP4", "B004SIP8ZM"], "bought_together": ["B002ZG98LO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JA8B", "B00007AJG4", "B00J0BTEQQ", "B001451HXO"]}, "price": 21.65, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 187088}, "asin": "B000GUJYQ0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519P94HP4GL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Predator / Predator 2 - 2-Movie Gift Set"}
{"description": "Aliaswas a show that constantly reinvented itself. And its fifth and final season was no exception, as the creative team behind the espionage show worked to pull together the labyrinthine plot elements that had existed over the years, as well as tailor the show around the pregnancy of star Jennifer Garner. The results were somewhat tinged with melancholy as everything was wrapped up, but also had a maturity and respect for its characters--which is not to say thatAliaslacked in action. In fact, the season started out with a literal bang, as a truck slammed into the car carrying Sydney Bristow (Garner) and her co-worker and lover Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan), right after Vaughn had made a mind-blowing revelation to Sydney. What followed was a mind-trippingly enticing blend of fake identities, false fronts, blind alleys, and new characters with dubious intentions, with the importance of the enigmatic Rambaldi device hanging over it all. Just another day at the office forAlias, you say? Not this time--for long-time fans of the shows, the true natures of all characters would finally be revealed, and Sydney would at long last discover the powers of the dreaded Rambaldi device, as well as who was behind the machinations to obtain it for world domination.WhatAliasdid best was mix its outlandish plotlines with accessible characters who were more than just pieces on an espionage game board. The final season did have a few false starts, as it juggled the departure (and reappearance) of established characters and the introduction of new ones, but by the time it had reached its 100th episode, \"There's Only One Sydney Bristow,\" battle lines were drawn as the core characters hurtled toward the show's conclusion. Not to be too cryptic, but the less you know the better, as part of the fun is puzzling out who's doing what to whom; suffice it to say that the ever-capable Garner, along with Victor Garber and Ron Rifkin as the dueling father figures in her life, laid a groundwork of personal drama that held the show together amidst all the shootouts, tech gadgets and costume changes. While (literally) everyone from Sydney's past made an appearance in the show's 100th episode (including an outstanding turn by Bradley Cooper as Syd's erstwhile friend Will), there were a couple great additions too: Rachel Nichols made a fetching Syd-in-training while Amy Acker, who played the daffy good-girl Fred onAngel, was a menacing and captivating adversary. We will answer one question for die-hardAliasfans: Yes, Lena Olin does return as the lethal Irina Derevko.

{"description": "Paul Newman's career slipped onto an unstoppable track withSomebody Up There Likes Me, his 1956 biopic about boxer Rocky Graziano. Of course that was his second picture, the first being the oft-joked-about bungleThe Silver Chalice. Newman's Method-y intensity and dazzling good looks brought him stardom, and his intelligence and uncommon seriousness as an actor kept his movies interesting, especially as he tackled some of the best roles of the \"antihero\" era--an era he helped create.Somebody Up There Likes Meis included inThe Paul Newman Collection, a bulging seven-DVD package that shakes out thusly:  three late-1950s titles from the beginning of his career, one mid-sixties hit, and three lesser films of the early 1970s. It's by no means a \"best of\" compilation, being limited to Warners and MGM titles, but it gives a flavor of Newman in his prime time. He got the Graziano role after James Dean died, and his performance is a very busy, post-Brando jumble of tics and mumbles. The movie holds up nicely as a boxing picture, and the location NYC shooting won an Oscar for cinematographer Joseph Ruttenberg (you can see why director Robert Wise got hired to doWest Side Storyafter this). Sal Mineo and Steve McQueen are in the cast as Newman's fellow j.d.s.The Left-Handed Gun(1958), based on a teleplay by Gore Vidal, is a truly weird, compulsively watchable artifact from the psychological-Western genre. Newman plays Billy the Kid, glowering and grimacing like a rebel without a cause. It's one of those films that has much more to do with the time it was made than the time it is set; also notable as the big-screen debut for stage and TV director Arthur Penn.The Young Philadelphians(1959) is more conventional, an entertaining soap opera about a young lawyer (Newman) with an old-money Philly name but no money, who gets burned by love and decides to connive his way to the top. Young Robert Vaughn snagged an Oscar nomination for a showy turn as an alcoholic society lad.Harper(1966) is chockfull of kooky mid-Sixties design and Rat Pack patter (courtesy screenwriter William Goldman). But it must be said that Newman is miscast as the melancholic private eye of Ross Macdonald's literary world, here re-imagined as a wisecracking hepcat who mugs his way through a missing-persons investigation. The supporting cast is a weird over-the-hill gang including Lauren Bacall, Janet Leigh, and Shelley Winters. That film's hero, Lew Harper (renamed from Macdonald's \"Archer\"), returned in 1976'sThe Drowning Pool, a more bearable if somewhat humdrum whodunit set in New Orleans. Newman's wife, Joanne Woodward, has a supporting part, but the picture is most notable for an early Melanie Griffith nymphet role.Pocket Money(1972) is one of those only-in-the-seventies movies that pairs Newman with Lee Marvin in a drowsy, nearly plotless comedy. Both actors give elaborate performances:  Newman plays a numbskull two-bit cattle broker who takes absolutely everything literally, and Marvin is his buddy in Mexico who signs on for an ill-considered cattle-buying job. One of the credited screenwriters is Terrence Malick, and the movie has a highly eccentric feel for language. Finally,The Mackintosh Man(1973) is one of the periodic duds that director John Huston would crank out in his otherwise starry career, with Newman as a spy on an incomprehensible case in England. The first half is a red herring, and Dominique Sanda (more recently ofThe Conformist) is out of depth with the English language. It's a bleak film with a kind of grinding fascination, and the Maurice Jarre score is catchy but fatally overused.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000NQRR34", "B00AEFY9GW", "B00008MTW2", "B00008MTW0", "B002CWKTU0", "B0006FO8PC", "B000EBD9U8", "B00441GYOM", "B000HWZ4D4", "B0052YDMZE", "B008RNYMT2", "B000EBD9T4", "B000063US2", "B000KNFP6G", "B0019UGYK0", "B0014BQR1A", "B00AEFXFW6", "B004SUDQ8G", "B00BTYPW8G", "B000LPG1KM", "B001GS7Z0I", "B0052YHHFA", "B00195I3PE", "B00KE3B6O2", "B000F7CMRC", "B00AEFYPHA", "B001KO1BBW", "B000KE5WL8", "B000FTCLQW", "B00319ECCY", "B00AEFY9YY", "B00J9BZ4KC", "B004LLIRRM", "B0007PALJS", "B000N3T0GY", "B000BT96DW", "B004LLIRRC", "B00J49R1BY", "078323211X", "B0001Z3I0I", "B0000DZTLW", "B003552QU4", "B000NTPG70", "B000CCW2UC", "B008JEJPJG", "B00083FZFE", "B00BTYRB58", "B000GRUQJW", "B000HWZ4EI", "B000031EGW", "B001CC7PM6", "B0007TKNKQ", "B0001GF2HY", "B0007TKGYY", "B002BIULMQ", "B000EHSVW8", "B000035Z5G", "B000B83846", "B000EHSVWS", "B00ICWO1LC", "B009X919UE", "B000N3T0GE", "B000OT6V0U", "B0008ENHUS", "B000M2E31I", "B00007ELD2", "B000EXDSBG", "B00195I3P4", "B00BTYU3UI", "B0007PALOI", "B0007MANZI", "B008L3650W", "B0007PALKC", "B000BDH6DU", "B000EHSVSW", "B00005JP3X", "B000244EWO", "B0006HBZBK", "B000JLTRGI", "B00IS6WQ2S", "B008JEJSB6", "B000BT96DC", "B001ER4CNO", "B003552QUY", "B000G6N0HI", "B004UOHNAC", "B00008PC1D", "B00153ZQSW", "B000054OTY", "B00005LOL5", "B0095Y3YHI", "B000063US3", "B0001WTWYW", "B000062XF2", "B000QRI1GW", "B000KE5V5K", "B0041ONFI0", "B000GETTIO", "B000TGJ82Q", "B0017TYPIG"], "bought_together": ["B000NQRR34", "B00AEFY9GW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000HWZ4D4", "B00BQ44ERE", "B00008MTW2", "B000EBD9T4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 152322}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 89.95, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000HWZ4DE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519KZ8K5BEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Paul Newman Collection (Harper / The Drowning Pool / The Left-Handed Gun / The Mackintosh Man / Pocket Money / Somebody Up There Likes Me / The Young Philadelphians)"}
{"description": "Lo and behold,Clerks IIdefies the odds as a sequel that even the most ardentClerksfans can be happy about. Twelve years after Kevin Smith turned the independent film world upside-down with his $27,000 black-and-white comedy, perpetual slackers Dante (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson) return for another raucous romp in suburbia, but this time there's no beloved Quick Stop mini-mart to ensure their low-level employment. Now they're aimless 33-year-olds flippin' burgers at Mooby's, a fast-food joint with a cow theme that's \"udderly delicious.\" Dante's engaged to his long-time girlfriend but has unexpectedly fallen in love with Mooby's manager Becky (and since she's played by Rosario Dawson, can you blame him?), and Randal's still holding out for life, liberty, and the pursuit of low ambition. The responsibilities of adulthood are rearing their ugly head, and with Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith) still dealing weed and generally being obnoxious, well... something's gotta give, right? The way Smith has written this long-awaited follow-up, the dilemmas of Dante, Randal, and their ongoing friendship are something that anyone can relate to, and with Dawson lighting up the screen (in a role demanded by producer Harvey Weinstein to boost box-office appeal), the movie's romantic chemistry is surprisingly delightful. Rest assured, also, that Smith (shooting mostly in color this time, on a $5 million budget) hasn't forgotten where he came from:Clerks IIis jam-packed with the same lewd, crude humor that madeClerksan indie-film phenomenon, and Smith's good-natured sincerity is still on full display, ensuring that only the most prudish viewers could possibly be offended. For everyone else, this is as enjoyable as any sequel could ever hope to be, with amusing cameos by Smith-movie veterans Ben Affleck and Jason Lee, among others.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SIP6LS", "B00000IQW4", "B004SIP8ES", "B004XVMCH6", "B007D0FUTG", "B00003CWOL", "B004U7MQW4", "B001KKU9DW", "B005FUTBWS", "B0016MJ6GA", "B00007149S", "B000CPH9PM", "B004SIP6N6", "B001CDFY4Q", "B000I0QLOQ", "B000ICL3L0", "B000EMGJAO", "1592406890", "B001OD4S50", "B000JJ4DNW", "B00068WOH8", "B0018BZEOC", "B005G5NPLA", "B0023TCWE8", "B00363WGBO", "B0002V7TMY", "B007D0FVYA", "B00003CXPS", "B000A7DVR2", "B001J9KJ4I", "0783230338", "B000BBOUCC", "B00009MGEM", "B000093FLA", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000031EFY", "B001C0JCBA", "B006WXHJLC", "B00029LO5E", "B001MFNB58", "0783227434", "B002ZG96ZC", "0800141687", "B008220BGQ", "B00007AJGM", "B0050PYNP8", "B00441GYVA", "B000M9CB4W", "1592407447", "B00BEIYH1A", "B00AEFXVW0", "B000WC3864", "B00AEFZ7F4", "B003VPX5Y4", "0767837398", "B005LAII12", "B000BYA5G4", "B009AMALGM", "B000AARKXA", "B00003CXS7", "B000GBEWGQ", "B000AXWHSA", "B004QL7K70", "0783229526", "B00005JN2Z", "B002O3Z4VG", "B00B4VSUBK", "B000WZEZGI", "B000VXWX7E", "B002ZG97XI", "B00BPEJWAE", "B008RNYMG0", "184856497X", "B00860YIJU", "B004SIP8ZM", "B004EPZ084", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00008975Z", "B00005JM23", "B000IZJZIU", "B003Y5H5C4", "B006TTC50Y", "B004SEUJFK", "B00E1HIX66", "B00005JKMN", "B00005JKHP", "B000069CF0", "B00007ELER", "B009DA743Y", "B001G5T6GW", "B00004TJMW", "B0006HBZE2", "B00005JNZU", "B00029RTAI", "B004UXUWEC", "B0018RKEQE", "6305551235", "B007WW94TW"], "bought_together": ["B004SIP6LS", "B00000IQW4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004SIP6LS", "B00000IQW4", "B0016MJ6GA", "B004SIP8ES"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14519}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.25, "brand": "Weinstein Company", "asin": "B000I0RNVQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51tIUlFx1EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Clerks II (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "For being one of the shows that's often thought of as an example of reality TV's origins, there's never been much reality in the overly long-lived seriesThe Simple Life. This two-sided, single disc of the fourth (and last) season has even less to do with reality than any of its preceding installments. Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie are still acting their parts of simpleton celebrities thrust into the \"real\" lives of regular folk, but during the contractually obligated production of what had become an astonishingly popular show, the poor little rich girls were in the midst of a bitter feud. They hated each others' guts, weren't speaking, and thanks to the machinations of their individual publicity experts, the whole world knew it. Consequently, the two rarely share screen time together except for ample sequences of split-screening, which makes for an even more bizarre pairing for two dim-witted million-heiresses who remain famous for nothing more that, well, being famous. Season four consists of a variety of slices of suburban Los Angeles family life with the wife/mother role being taken over on alternate days by either Paris or Nicole. As usual, they sneer and make fun of the lower class that they visit--all the while showing absolutely no class of their own. Their feud is vaguely addressed in the first episode, with the other nine being fairly rote imitations of their earlier-season forays into the humdrum of screaming kids, grocery shopping, preparing food, bill-paying, and every other mundane things the girls have been coached into criticizing and laughing at by the show's producers. We're invited into some parts of the girls' \"real\" lives with glimpses into their homes amidst their psychological destruction of others'. But as with the prior seasons, the can't-look-away-from-the-train-wreck aspect is the thing that keeps our attention. They hate us and we hate them, so it's the very definition of symbiotic entertainment. Since they also hate each other there's an extra element of amusement; only don't think too hard lest the fine line between amusement and contempt disappears. Who knows if their feud was real or made up by the genius publicity machines behind their fame. One thing that's not made up and definitely not comical is the gruesome change in Nicole Richie's body as her issues with low body weight reveal itself over the course of the episodes.

{"description": "Continuing the BBC's unrivalled reputation for costume drama, their new adaptation of Jane Eyre proved to be one of the television triumphs of 2006. Based, as you'd expect, on the Charlotte Bronte book of the same name, this two-disc set brings together the full series, spread across the best part of four sumptuous hours.\nIt's a faithful adaptation, with Ruth Wilson giving an exceptional performance in the title role. Mr Rochester's boots, meanwhile, are filled by Toby Stephenson, and both prove to be wise choices. Backed up by an excellent supporting cast, they're also supported by some quite superb scenery, warm photography and skilful, at times neatly understated the direction, that gives the story space to develop.\n\nIs the best adaptation of Jane Eyre? It certainly builds a compelling case, and while there's the odd slight misstep along the way, it's primarily a terrific interpretation of a classic romance. Perhaps the only real disappointment is that the DVD release itself doesn't offer more in the way of added features, but given the presentation and quality of the main attraction, that's unlikely, rightly, to deter those in search of some classic BBC drama. --Jon Foster \n\n\nProduct Description\nDVD includes Audio Navigation and Description on both discs", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000784WMW", "B0053Q9DHW", "B00AF82WTO", "B00G6HO368", "B00005JOA0", "B002XTBE6K", "B000Z27HLS", "0767020294", "B000AYEL6U", "B0012OVCE6", "B00003JRCQ", "B005GRF2UK", "B001PUTN3Y", "B004XVMCMQ", "0800141660", "B000FS9FG2", "B0053Q9DQI", "B000MGBLHS", "B0012Q3T6I", "B000Z27HMW", "B00062IZ0Y", "B000E1ZBGS", "B000S2B23E", "B000784WNQ", "B008KEQLZ6", "0767020308", "B004SIP7AS", "B001PJRAUS", "B001TJYFRU", "B000244FDW", "B004P7CNZO", "B00BQXTCYK", "B0000AUHPK", "1494464586", "B00AATUZQA", "B005603236", "1843175711", "B000GIXLUC", "B00005R5GB", "B0000AQS3P", "B001C4AFOY", "B000M2E32M", "B0009UZGAA", "B000E0ODZE", "0141040386", "0767812115", "B001PU8N0I", "B000089QEM", "B000A8AXXG", "B00005JKKY", "B001J4E1D8", "0767851013", "B000FQIRXQ", "B000GRUQKQ", "B0077PBPGO", "B000EBD9VC", "B000ZS8GW6", "B003U80I5G", "B000N4SHOE", "B001P807RC", "B00008G8WJ", "B00G7QPXAI", "B00006HAZH", "B0009PVZL4", "B000M2E32C", "190463303X", "B00005B1VM", "B001C46P2K", "B00005YUNK", "B003QP2TW8", "B0041I8DLK", "B000244F9G", "B000BKDNX0", "B0000C23D5", "B0009PVZM8", "B00141188M", "B00E1LSJIO", "B004SI5VSQ", "B000BITVAG", "B00065GX96", "B005Q7UGLA", "0679409882", "B005T0OY5S", "B00F1BFRA6", "B000NOIX48", "B008N25XAE", "B0007OY2P8", "0307700372", "B002VWNICW", "1853260649", "B007A2O3FO", "0307917703", "B00005O7N8", "B004VK744A", "B00G6HO3OA", "B0004Z33DM", "B000KJU132", "B009L2EW5W", "B001L57ZZG", "B0080QOL10"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0053Q9DHW", "B000784WMW", "B000S2B23E", "B00G6HO368"]}, "price": 29.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 214466}, "asin": "B000IJ7H2C", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SEkByt8DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jane Eyre (BBC) [Region 2] [UK Import]"}

{"description": "This clever, funny big-screen adaptation of Lauren Weisberger's best-seller takes some of the snarky bite out of the chick lit book, but smoothes out the characters' boxy edges to make a more satisfying movie. There's no doubtThe Devil Wears Prada belongs to Meryl Streep, who turns in an Oscar&#65533;-worthy (seriously!) strut as the monster editor-in-chief ofRunway, an elite fashion magazine full of size-0, impossibly well-dressed plebes. This makes new second-assistant Andrea (Anne Hathaway), who's smart but an unacceptable size 6, stick out like a sore thumb. Streep has a ball sending her new slave on any whimsical errand, whether it's finding the seventh (unpublished) Harry Potter book or knowing what type she means when she wants \"skirts.\" Though Andrea thumbs her nose at the shallow world of fashion (she's only doing the job to open doors to a position atThe New Yorker someday), she finds herself dually disgusted yet seduced by the perks of the fast life. The film sends a basic message: Make work your priority, and you'll be rich and powerful... and lonely. Any other actress would have turned Miranda into a scenery-chewing Cruella, but Streep's underplayed, brilliant comic timing make her a fascinating, unapologetic character. Adding frills to the movie's fun are Stanley Tucci as Streep's second-in-command, Emily Blunt (My Summer of Love) as the overworked first assistant, Simon Baker as a sexy writer, and breathtaking couture designs any reader ofVogue would salivate over. --Ellen A.

{"description": "If Richard Donner's 1978 feature filmSuperman: The Moviemade us believe a man could fly, Bryan Singer's 2006 follow-up,Superman Returns, lets us remember that a superhero movie can make our spirits soar. Superman (played by newcomer Brandon Routh) comes back to Earth after a futile five-year search for his destroyed home planet of Krypton. As alter ego Clark Kent, he's eager to return to his job at the Daily Planet and to see Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth). Lois, however, has moved on: she now has a fianc&#xE9; (James Marsden), a son (Tristan Leabu), and a Pulitzer Prize for her article entitled \"Why the World Doesn't Need Superman.\" On top of this emotional curveball, his old archrival Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) is plotting the biggest land grab in history.Singer, who made a strong impression among comic-book fans for his work on the X-Men franchise and directed Spacey inThe Usual Suspects, brings both a fresh eye and a sense of respect to the world's oldest superhero. He borrows John Williams's great theme music and Marlon Brando's voice as Jor-El, and the story (penned by Singer'sX-Mencollaborators Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris) is a sort-of-sequel to the first two films in the franchise (choosing to ignore that the third and fourth movies ever happened). The humorous and romantic elements give the movie a heart, Singer's art-deco Metropolis is often breathtaking, and the special effects are elegant and spectacular, particularly an early airplane-disaster set-piece. Of the cast, Routh is excellent as the dual Superman/Clark, Spacey is both droll and vicious as Luthor, and Parker Posey gets the best lines as Luthor's moll Kitty. But at 23, Bosworth seems too young for the five-years-past-grizzled Lois. It's nice to see Noel Neill, Jack Larson (both from the classicAdventures of SupermanTV series), and Eva Marie-Saint on the screen as well. Superman Returns is one of those projects that was in development for seemingly forever, but it was worth the wait -- it's the most enjoyable superhero movie sinceSpider-Man 2andThe Incredibles.--David HoriuchiMore SupermanWatch our exclusive interviews with the cast ofSuperman ReturnsOther feature filmsSuperman in high definitionSmallvilleAdventures of SupermanSee all Superman DVDs", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001DJLD2G", "B000IJ79VQ", "B000IJ79X4", "B000IJ79XE", "B000IJ79WU", "B008JFUPFI", "B000IJ79UW", "B001CDR1FG", "B000ION23U", "B002GSXKN8", "B004EPZ07K", "B0000959N0", "B00005JNTU", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001DHXT20", "B000VI70QS", "B0006L0LOS", "B0007P0Y7C", "B000UR9T8C", "B00005JNJV", "B00005JMQW", "B00005JKCH", "B000AYELVU", "B004LWZW42", "B0090SI56Y", "B001OST0LW", "B001OST0M6", "B001QB9H1U", "B000HCO83Q", "B000PE0G0A", "B001GCUO1Q", "B0002IQMAM", "B004LWZWGA", "B008JFUS0U", "B000P0J06K", "B000OVLBF8", "B00E5I2MCM", "B003YAR97K", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00080ZG2O", "B003QO8TOQ", "B001FB55HQ", "B005LAIGW8", "B000I8OM94", "B000FO0AHY", "B00IZZDWKM", "B000P0J06U", "B0007V6ITE", "B008JFUO72", "B000AYELVA", "B002NXSRVG", "B00DYEN6XC", "B00E5I2MEK", "B000BT96EG", "B001HQZJMU", "B001QTXM5Y", "B00E5I2M6I", "B002HWRYJE", "B00E5I2M9K", "B001614E68", "B000059Z8L", "B001VLBDD0", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B000EU1Q2M", "B000KJU1KK", "B00BTYMPUY", "B000H30B2C", "B001F7MSFM", "B0013BM63O", "B00F4FFO8E", "B000EGDB10", "B00008G8M5", "B00JPS7HOA", "0790738953", "B000B7QCGS", "B000HWZ4E8", "B00BBXSPES", "B000FMGTTE", "B0083SBMBM", "B003Z8ZCDO", "B005LAII44", "B000P6XQ50", "B000VI28Z6", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001RHGRT8", "B000F4RH8E", "B002ZG99B8", "B001AK3S4Y", "B00005JL78", "B0002ZMHX6", "B0007G89FU", "B006VRRGNK", "B00BBAQD6S", "B009JBWOU0", "B000BT96FA", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00BGI086Q", "B003UN2ICM", "B0000VCZMK"], "bought_together": ["B008JFUPFI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008JFUPFI", "B00F4FFO8E", "B001DJLD2G", "B000IJ79UW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 57565}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.73, "brand": "DC Comics", "asin": "B000J10EQU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ddmxk8VML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Superman Returns (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Home from the Hillis among the underrated titles in the careers of Robert Mitchum and Vincente Minnelli, two disparate talents who create a potent familial saga here. The setting is East Texas, where Mitchum's philandering patriarch rules the local area. His wife (Eleanor Parker) has raised their son (George Hamilton) as a momma's boy, the kind of soft kid who gets bamboozled into going on a \"snipe hunt\" with the pranking locals. His opposite number is a manly farmhand (George Peppard) with his own bond with Mitchum. Southern melodrama thrives in such a setting, and the film doesn't avoid all the traps, but Minnelli suffuses the movie with the same emotional effects of color and movement that he brought to his direction of musicals. Minnelli's sensitivity and Mitchum's strength carry the movie, but the secret weapon is the unexpectedly good work from the two Georges, both of whom were at the beginning of their careers. (You can see from this film that Peppard is a dead-cert to become a major movie star, which he almost did--but then didn't, for a variety of reasons.) The film was shot on location around Paris, Texas, and although this is far from Minnelli'sAn American in Paris, the exciting hunting sequences are solid proof that you can't pigeonhole a talented director. You can't pigeonhole Mitchum, either, and this is one of his best roles.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000JLTRG8", "B000BDH6E4", "B00195I3OU", "B000FUH38C", "B00008DDGW", "B000JU8HBA", "B00005BCK0", "B00195I3P4", "B00005LC4D", "B008JEJSB6", "B00143XE1O", "B000056H2H", "B000QRI1GW", "B00195I3OK", "B00005JP3X", "B00008MTW2", "B00FNR9YY8", "B0029B4ZVI", "B000244EYW", "B0026KWLAO", "B001QYVW0Q", "B00008CMT3", "B007RKFXQW", "B00008MTW0", "B003ZYU3U0", "B000EHSVVY", "B000CBG5PQ", "0767827791", "B00004XMV9", "B0001NBMHQ", "B00195I3PE", "B000XT1P48", "B001LPWGGY", "B003552QU4", "B00005JP4J", "B00083FZFE", "B0002HOEQM", "B00009AVA5", "B00BTYSIV4", "B007232DF8", "B00CV1PFTC", "B000N3T0GY", "B000FTCLQW", "B0001GF2HY", "B00005JP3T", "B000HA4WSO", "B00D6I7JEI", "B0000AUHQA", "B00KIZYDCI", "B000FKO3V2", "B000OT6V0U", "B007TYI7YQ", "B000EBD9T4", "B00BTYU3UI", "B0007QS2ZM", "B00BTYPW8G", "B0000DJZ8Q", "B002DDQVP0", "B00005AUKC", "B0007OY2OY", "B000E1MXSW", "B0007US7FI", "B000JF5T5W", "B009WHDEQO", "B00AEFYPHA", "B00005PJ6T", "B00BCMSYDU", "B001HSNTKW", "B000EBD9TE", "B001CR4966", "B004LB5FAE", "B0041ONFI0", "B000EHSVW8", "B006W95BXO", "B000KJU18C", "B006VRRGOO", "B009INAHZS", "B000JLTREK", "B0006B2A7E", "B00AEBB932", "B0052YHHFA", "B000RXVND8", "B00E5N8SFC", "B0001NBMH6", "B008FYZJ0O", "B00BY8DAAE", "B00ED2SZLC", "B000AP04M4", "B000054OTY", "B004KO1HG8", "B001CC7PM6", "B004XKVP7K", "B0016LFG2Y", "B00AATV07S", "B00074DY16", "B00096S4BM", "B0001Z3I0I", "B000244EZ6", "B0039R18WU", "B0082SICCU"], "bought_together": ["B000JLTRG8", "B000FUH38C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000JLTRGI", "B000FUH38C", "B00AEFXUL2", "B0045HCJSK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 34092}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.16, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000JLTR9A", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SHuVC9JfL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Home from the Hill"}
{"description": "Pile together a blue-ribbon cast, a screenplay high in quirkiness, and the Sundance stamp of approval, and youve got yourself a crossover indie hit. That formula worked for Little Miss Sunshine, a frequently hilarious study of family dysfunction. Meet the Hoovers, an Albuquerque clan riddled with depression, hostility, and the tattered remnants of the American Dream; despite their flakiness, they manage to pile into a VW van for a weekend trek to L.A. in order to get moppet daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) into the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. Much of the pleasure of this journey comes from watching some skillful comic actors doing their thing: Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette as the parents (hes hoping to become a self-help authority), Alan Arkin as a grandfather all too willing to give uproariously inappropriate advice to a sullen teenage grandson (Paul Dano), and a subdued Steve Carell as a jilted gay professor on the verge of suicide. The film is a crowd-pleaser, and if anything is a little too eager to bend itself in the direction of quirk-loving Sundance audiences; it can feel forced. But the breezy momentum and the ingenious actors help push the material over any bumps in the road. -- Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000YABYLA", "B00005JMJG", "B001UV4XGU", "B00A81MV3U", "B00DL46ZN8", "B00005JNC2", "B0007TKOAA", "B001UV4XUG", "B00005ALS0", "B00118T632", "B00AEFXESQ", "B007L6VR12", "B008220BA2", "B003L20ICE", "B0000640VJ", "B008OHV49W", "B001P9KR8U", "B000A7DVR2", "B00000F5MN", "B007L6VRBM", "B00AFEY354", "B0001GOH6Q", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00337KM2S", "B000H0MKOC", "B004UXUX4Q", "B0034G4OZE", "B00011CZRE", "B00275EGWY", "0205751989", "B000FVQLQQ", "B0010X8NF0", "B004SIP95G", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B004QL7KKC", "B00079Z9VO", "B00003CXZ4", "B0021L8UOY", "B001MM3AZM", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00606P0BM", "B00005Q4CS", "B00ADRYCWC", "B001TOD92C", "B004SEUIW4", "B000P0J0EW", "B0015OKWKI", "B000CS464G", "B0007PLLBU", "B00009W5CA", "B00005JLSB", "B004A8ZWV0", "B007RKFXUS", "B0010AN7Z4", "B00012QLB4", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B003UESJH4", "B00005JNBQ", "B007VYE4PK", "B000WZEZGI", "B00AEBB9F0", "6304907729", "B003Y5H574", "B000SFOW8I", "B00005JMJ4", "B001BL96K2", "B00006FMUW", "B002VPTJOA", "B00003CXO1", "B000J103OI", "B0038N9WKU", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00008975Z", "B003ASLJQI", "B0049985XW", "B003ASLJO0", "B001J9KJ4I", "B001FZQOW2", "B00000G02H", "1557047707", "B000BYRCQU", "B00121QGPY", "B00005JL57", "B000021Y77", "B000A3XY5A", "B000MZHW40", "B0000AC8LR", "B00AEFY0KW", "B0045HCJ9E", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B00AEBB9FA", "B00005A06N", "B000ELJAEM", "B00AEFYAMA", "B00E8RKHWW", "B00005JLRE", "B005LAIHE0", "B000M341QE", "B0039UT3LK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00118T632", "B00DL46ZN8", "B0007UC8Y4", "B001AGXEAG"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 401537}, "asin": "B000JU9OJ4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51T7A7BDBWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Little Miss Sunshine [Region 2]"}

{"description": "Annette Bening is the stand-out highlight in this dysfunctional \"family\" comedy based on the bestselling memoir by Augusten Burroughs. Although fans of the book may be slightly disappointed with the film's uneven and somewhat campy rendition of Burroughs' twisted adolescence in the 1970s, there's plenty of pleasure to be found in the work of an excellent cast led by Bening, who gives a subtle dare-to-hate-me performance as Burroughs' mother Diedre, a would-be poet who's so aloof about her teenage son Augusten (played by fresh-faced newcomer Joseph Cross, fromFlags of Our Fathers) that she allows him to be legally adopted into the eccentric family of her psychiatrist, Dr. Finch (Brian Cox). As the half-crazed Finch overmedicates Diedre into a haze of semi-conscious madness, he also turns Augusten's life upside down while his wife (Jill Clayburgh) and daughters (Gwyneth Paltrow, Evan Rachel Wood) indulge their own eccentricities and Augusten enters into an intimate relationship with one of Finch's adopted patients (played by Joseph Fiennes).As adapted and directed by Nip/Tuck creator Ryan Murphy,Running with Scissorslacks the singular voice of Burroughs' dryly comedic first-person narrative, but even as the film struggles to find a consistent tone, it's so full of wacky behavior that you can't help laughing. It's a messy, patchwork quilt of a movie, blessed by authentically garish '70s production design and a soundtrack of familiar '70s hits. In rendering Burroughs' indelible portrait of weak, irresponsible adults and the people they victimize, Murphy and his well-chosen cast (which also includes Alec Baldwin as Diedre's ex-husband) find moments of touching pathos amidst the madness. For her part, Bening delivers an acclaimed performance that gives the film a dramatic weight it otherwise lacks. The rest is for anyone who enjoys a laugh at the freak-show expense of damaged and damaging characters. --Jeff ShannonStills fromRunning with Scissors(click for larger image)MoreRunning with Scissorson Amazon.comThe BookMore Films staring Annette BeningMore Films about Eccentric Families", "related": {"also_bought": ["031242227X", "125003440X", "031242681X", "0312428278", "0312422288", "0312315953", "0312341911", "0312272057", "B00003CWQR", "0312563558", "B0034G4OZE", "B001TK2BMK", "1250032105", "B000CS464G", "B006G7YSP4", "B000087F7E", "0312315945", "B000JBWWQA", "B000KX0IOK", "B00AEFXESQ", "140006869X", "B00007JXWX", "B00AFEY354", "B00013RC2K", "B0000640VJ", "B00005JMJG", "0312283709", "1427200718", "B00175VSBC", "B0000AC8LR", "B0016MJ6T2", "B00AEFYSWM", "B000EHQU0S", "0307395987", "B00049QQHI", "0312315961", "B002VECLVO", "B004SEUIZG", "6305784817", "B00005Q4CS", "B0007PALGG", "B0006TPE4C", "B00008DP4C", "B00005JLSB", "B00001PE4D", "B00005JLHW", "B000FVQLQQ", "B003L20ICE", "B000N3SU92", "B00004UEDQ", "B0007G89FK", "B000MEYKD2", "B001JIE7JC", "B004FQX5B6", "B0014D5RBE", "B00070EBOY", "B00003CWTI", "B007HRKBI0", "0307396185", "B0057ZAA6W", "B005PTMPYA", "B0041KKYEM", "B00ADRYCWC", "0312938853", "B000F6II1M", "B0001DMVBC", "B0053XZ8O2", "B00008972P", "B0001EFUFK", "B0014GI6I2", "B00DW5IKYS", "B000E33VWW", "B0058ZPNOK", "B006QVRVJK", "B0036TGT8Y", "B00FXWAZW8", "B000QGDY0G", "B004H83IG4", "B005C7SXMS", "B000A7DVR2", "B0016LFG4C", "0800177789", "B002LMV7RA", "B00004TWZH", "B00CC2V7AQ", "B005DI8X3K", "B00EYPJHDI", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00AEFY8MM", "B000H9I1OG", "0316777730", "B00005JLQH", "B000092T3P", "B0043X1FL8", "B0010X8NF0", "B004499LX0", "B00AEFXUXU", "B008N25X7M", "B002DP0J24", "B0007UC8Y4"], "bought_together": ["031242227X", "125003440X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002HJ3KD6", "125003440X", "1250032105", "B000GQLCQY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 56416}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.5, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000M5B98A", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51xHRfPC6cL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Running With Scissors"}
