{"description": "Typical of Disney's 1970s output, this squeaky-clean comic adventure about a group of church volunteers and soccer moms who take on local gangsters is packed with slapstick humor, sight gags, and nonlethal car crashes. Curiously enough, it's based on the true story of Reverend Albert Fay Hill, who wrote a book about his efforts to stop mob-run gambling in his city. Edward Herrmann plays the fictionalized Presbyterian minister Mike Hill, a soft-spoken widower with two kids who ruffles the feathers of the dedicated church secretary (Susan Clark) when he organizes a group of women to help the Treasury Department catch the bookies in the act. The mobsters are more Damon Runyon than John Gotti: no one gets hurt and everything ends in a demolition derby free-for-all as the suburban-lady volunteers play bumper cars with the mobsters. There's a potentially fascinating story in there that Disney keeps a G-rated cap on (though seeing Karen Valentine swingin' her booty under the cover of pounds of makeup and a little halter top is a surprise in a family film), but it's a harmless little comedy enlivened by plucky performances by Barbara Harris and Cloris Leachman and a fun turn by Ruth Buzzie as a church elder with a CB-radio handle.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301708261", "6301708288", "B000GNOSHW"], "also_viewed": ["B0000AQZYM", "6301708113"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 368172}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.78, "brand": "", "asin": "076400557X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MBP8T6XML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "North Avenue Irregulars [VHS]"}
{"description": "Woody Allen's feature-film debut,Take the Money and Run, a mockumentary that combines sight gags, sketchlike scenes, and standup jokes at rat-a-tat speed, looks positively primitive compared to his mature work. Primitive, but awfully funny. Allen plays Virgil Starkwell, a music-loving nebbish who turns to a life of crime at an early age and, undaunted by his utter and complete failure to pull off a single successful robbery, continues his unbroken spree of bungled heists and prison breaks even after he marries and raises a family. Narrator Jackson Beck, whose stentorian voice of authority makes a perfect foil for Starkwell's absurd exploits, lobs one droll quip after another with deadpan seriousness. Though spotty, Allen tosses so many jokes into the mix that it hardly matters and when they hit they are often hilarious: the chain gang posing as cousins to their old-woman hostage (\"We're very close,\" Virgil explains to a dim cop), arguing with a dotty movie director who is supposed to be their cover for a bank robbery, Virgil's escape attempt with a bar of soap. Allen spoofs decades of crime films, everything fromI Am a Fugitive from a Chain GangtoBonnie and Clyde, but you don't have to know the movies to enjoy this goofy, sometimes clumsy, but quite clever comedy.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000068DV", "6303011411", "0792846117", "6300216365", "B00003CXGR", "6304785801"], "also_viewed": ["6302697042"]}, "price": 19.9, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 382476}, "asin": "0764003828", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TBXJ3E20L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Take the Money and Run [VHS]"}

James Darren narrates a little ditty at his honeymoon in Malta during filming; Irene Papas narrates a giddy, old-fashioned look at \"Two Girls on the Town.\" There's even a filmed bit with producer-writer Carl Foreman that showed once at the premiere. The 20-minute retrospective made in 1999 has the expected reminiscences from Gregory Peck and Anthony Quinn. Director J.&nbsp;Lee Thompson's audio commentary is a bit frustrating; he's now in his 80s, and most of his recollections are slow in coming.

{"description": "You might not get a thrill from the sight of Faye Dunaway and Marlon Brando throwing popcorn into each other's mouths, but that didn't stopDon Juan DeMarcofrom gaining a new lease on life thanks to cable television and home video. It's a quirky romantic comedy about a mental patient (Johnny Depp) who claims to be Don Juan, the world's greatest lover, and he gets quite a few women to believe it's true. Brando plays the psychiatrist who tries to analyze his patient's apparent delusion, and Dunaway plays Brando's wife, who wants to inject some Don Juan-ish romance into their marital routine. Walking a fine line between precious comedy, wistful drama, and delicate fantasy, the movie gets a big dose of charm from its esteemed cast, with Depp delivering dialogue that would have sounded ludicrous from a lesser actor.

{"description": "Edward Norton was nominated for a 1998 Best Actor Oscar for his role as  Derek Vinyard, a thoughtful kid turned neo-Nazi after his father is slain.  Edward Furlong plays his younger brother, Danny, determined to follow in his brother's footsteps.  The easy routes the film seems prepared to take never materialize.  It continually makes Derek's transformation both in and out of his racist beliefs believable and persuasive.  Stacy Keach is given the head vampire role of the local skinhead chapter, Cameron, and he's the closest this film comes to an overt overstatement.  Norton, however, is fantastic, embodying a person who roller-coasters through hatred like he can't wait to ride again.  His diatribes are not unlike what can be heard on any given conservative radio station on any given day, but he doesn't spew them as cant or screed.  Only when his violent emotions take charge, negating any sense or stand, is the underlying fallacy and nature of his beliefs made plain. This film was undermined by the film's own director, Tony Kaye, who made such a braying ass of himself and his work that it distorted the public's view of what is an interesting social and psychological lesson in the war between ideas and ideologues, reason and racism.--Keith Simanton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303686796", "B00004W5UA", "B00000J2L7"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 321982}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.59, "brand": "", "asin": "0780625129", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516KFV9DGKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "American History X [VHS]"}

{"description": "Based on a novel by Edward Lewis Wallant, this gritty story follows Sol (Rod Steiger in a breakout performance), a lonely camp survivor who has dealt with the destruction of his family by suppressing all emotion and cleaving to the philosophy that nothing matters except money. (His bedridden and dying friend Mendel describes him, to his face, as \"the walking dead.\") Sol cannot accept the friendship of his assistant, Ortiz (Jaime Sanchez), or of an equally lonely widow (Geraldine Fitzgerald). As the 25th anniversary of his wife's murder approaches, he starts to fall apart, and it becomes clear that what he really wants is to die. The film was considered shocking when first released, both because of its rawness and because of brief nudity. Time has made some of the dramatic touches seem melodramatic--especially the corny \"blood on my hands!\" final scene. But Steiger's performance is still remarkable, and, even after MTV, the sudden-flashback editing is a forceful technique. A high point of Sidney Lumet's career.

Simultaneously violent, funny, and suspenseful,Boundis sure to test your tolerance for bloodshed, but the film is crafted with such undeniable skill that several critics (including Roger Ebert) placed it on their top-ten lists for 1996.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00002CGGH", "B00023P4M4", "B00004U104", "B000PMFS2I", "B00006RJ97", "B0001HAGSI", "B000F7CEBG", "B0002KPIQY", "B002SF9YTS", "B00AFDN5Y0", "B00005QW5T", "B000OVLC0W", "B008XAGN46", "B00GPPXNIK", "B0001GF2D8", "B004BJMEO6", "B000SUKPL6", "B00011Y1QC", "B000J4QWIG", "B00009MEB8", "B004EI2NM2", "B000A4T804", "B000TLTCQI", "B0045HCIYA", "B00003CYJ4", "B00005JKJA", "B00005QJIG", "B00006CXI7", "B00003CWN3", "B0038M61IC", "B004N21KIC", "B005Q4CLKW", "B00FKPJ3VM", "B0029Z8K74", "B00008972P", "B0037QGS0A", "B00005NRNS", "0783226993", "B002AS463W", "B000A2X46K", "B00005BKZK", "B004AYMY92", "B00019075S", "0783230559", "B000F3UA6Q", "B00006L91I", "B000E5N684", "B00C1LIZEE", "B0006IIPLM", "B00441GZ00", "B0045O2PHS", "B000O76ZO4", "B003YJFALI", "B000F0UUD2", "B0009298MU", "B000AQOHN0", "B000BX0VT6", "B000069HZO", "B00LEW3L5Y", "B005JZBPHS", "B00CBG9SQS", "B001CRC4DG", "B00EMAGCHE", "B00005V4XV", "B001E2PQGG", "B000F4RHBQ", "B00006RCNY", "B00004STHG", "B000EQ5SRK", "0767835093", "B00005V9ID", "B002CA68NO", "B00I3SW3CE", "B000HC2LHG", "6305065551", "B001LMU1NC", "B000AM6OVW", "B004AHAEV4", "B00E8G5HXM", "B000HT3P4M", "B0001US62I", "B0002KQNKE", "B003OYPOUA", "B0000639HI", "B004SIP9CO", "B006M3M5FM", "B004SUDQC2", "B002T4GY4Q", "1573441996", "B00AEBBA4K", "B00003CXKS", "B00AG474YU", "B003Z8ZC2A", "B00AEFYD2M", "B00ELE8D2I", "B00BTYJYOY", "B003J216KO", "B0010SAGHS", "B0006QAIG4"], "bought_together": ["B00002CGGH", "B00004U104"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000PMFS2I", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B00AFDN5Y0", "B00006RJ97"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 193661}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 34.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0782008364", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BRDFP1Y7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bound (Unrated)"}
{"description": "The dominant themes of director Sidney Lumet's distinguished career are in full force in this moral melodrama involving a young district attorney (Andy Garcia) who takes on a career-making case only to uncover his father's possible involvement in pervasive police corruption. Balancing personal ethics and political compromise in a high-wire act of power and its abuse, Lumet relies on dialogue and superb performances (including those by Ron Leibman, Richard Dreyfuss, and Lena Olin) to achieve a devastating impact. The script (based on the novelTainted Evidenceby Robert Daley) is too smart and Lumet's direction too sure-footed to fall back on the black-and-white exploits of conventional criminals and their crimes. The movie's moral framework (like that of Lumet's earlier filmQ&A;) is more realistic, dealing in the gray areas between right and wrong where misdeeds can arise from the best intentions. At the center of Garcia's dilemma is his father, a seasoned New York cop played so convincingly by Ian Holm that you'd never guess the actor was British. Although it received mixed reviews when released in 1997,Night Falls on Manhattanranks among Lumet's finest films.--Jeff Shannon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 228780}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0782007058", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MBY8BXTBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Night Falls on Manhattan [VHS]"}

{"description": "There are two versions of the 1995 space adventure on this 10th anniversary DVD set, but it's not what you think.

The first major Hollywood film to be reprocessed for viewing on these massive screens,Apollo 13was shortened by 24 minutes so it could be loaded onto the gigantic reels in the IMAX theaters. The new cut delivers a mostly space-centered film; much of the domestic scenes (featuring Kathleen Quinlan's Oscar-nominated performance) are gone, which may help young space cadets get into the film. The IMAX print is also less wide than the theatrical version (1.66:1 versus 2.35:1) and delivers a DTS soundtrack not found on the theatrical version. Both prints are remastered and look grand. The main features from the initial DVD are intact (the making-of feature and two commentary tracks).

{"description": "Sir Jeremy Isaacs highly deserves the numerous awards for documentaries he has earned: the Royal Television Society's Desmond Davis Award, l'Ordre National du M&eacute;rit, an Emmy, and a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II. His epicThe World at Warremains unsurpassed as the definitive visual history of World War II.The Second World War was different from other wars in thousands of ways, one of which was the unparalleled scope of visual documents kept by the Axis and Allies of all their activities. As a result, this war is understood as much through written histories as it is through its powerful images. The Nazis were particularly thorough in documenting even the most abhorrent of the atrocities they were committing--in a surprising amount of color footage.The World at Warwas one of the first television documentaries that exploited these resources so completely, giving viewers an unbelievable visual guide to the greatest event in the 20th century. This is to say nothing of the excellent, comprehensible narrative. Some highlights:A New Germany 1933-39: early German and Nazi documentation of Hitler's rise to power through the impending attack on PolandWhirlwind: the early British losses in the blitz in the skies over Britain and in North AfricaStalingrad: the turning point of the war and Germany's first defeatInside the Reich--Germany 1940-44: one of the most fascinating documentaries that exists on life inside Nazi Germany, fromLebensbornto the Hitler YouthMorning: prior toSaving Private Ryan, one of the only unromanticized views of the Normandy invasionGenocide: this film is one of the most widely shown introductions to the HolocaustJapan 1941-45: althoughThe World at Waris decidedly focused more on the European theater, this is an important look into wartime Japan and its expansion--early 20th-century history that lead to Japan's role in World War II is superficialThe bomb: another widely shown documentary of the Manhattan Project, the Enola Gay, Hiroshima, and NagasakiThe World at Warwill remain the definitive visual history of World War II, analogous to Gibbon'sDecline and Fall of the Roman Empire. No serious historian should be missingThe World at Warin a collection, and no student should leave school without having seen at least some of its salient episodes.

It stars Dennis Weaver as a driver being pursued by a menacing truck, which is following him with all the vengeance of the ancient furies. In this spiritual update from 1984, C.&nbsp;Thomas Howell plays a guy taking a drive-away car from Chicago to San Diego. On a whim, in the rain, and against his better judgment, he picks up a hitchhiker (Rutger Hauer). The hitcher quickly admits to being a murdering psychopath, and once Howell finally gets him out of his car, he is pursued with all the vengeance of the ancient furies. We're never sure if the hitcher is a figment of his imagination, making Howell a schizophrenic killer, or if he's real and Howell is the random victim of a wandering madman, which is how his potential new girlfriend (Jennifer Jason Leigh) thinks of him.

{"description": "After building up the duo's popularity through popular recordings and several performances onSaturday Night Live,John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd--as \"legendary\" Chicago blues brothers Jake and Elwood Blues--took their act to the big screen in this action-packed hit from 1980. As Jake and Elwood struggle to reunite their old band and save the Chicago orphanage where they were raised, they wreak enough good-natured havoc to attract the entire Cook County police force. The result is a big-budget stunt-fest on a scale rarely attempted before or since, including extended car chases that result in the wanton destruction of shopping malls and more police cars than you can count. Along the way there's plenty of music to punctuate the action, including performances by Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Cab Calloway, and James Brown that are guaranteed to knock you out. As played with deadpan wit by Belushi and Aykroyd, the Blues Brothers are \"on a mission from God,\" and that gives them a kind of reckless glee that keeps the movie from losing its comedic appeal. Otherwise this might have been just a bloated marathon of mayhem that quickly wears out its welcome (which is how some critics described this film and its 1998 sequel). Keep an eye out for Steven Spielberg as the city clerk who stamps some crucial paperwork near the end of the film.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783227078", "6300182150", "B000005PFL", "0800198395", "6302877881", "6301569385", "6300989003", "630220366X", "6305576173", "B000006N70", "6304071876", "6301300394", "B00005Q4GY", "6301971809", "630281622X", "0800132009", "B0000068ZQ", "6305363668", "B00005RRG6", "6301697294", "6304196954", "0783202253", "6300181987", "6301208773", "6302032377", "0800116917", "6304107250", "6303168507", "0766202771", "0783235607", "6300246965", "B000077VT7", "6302909023", "630150528X", "6304155972", "B000005QWI", "B000007PI9", "630470786X", "6300214567", "6303057225", "0792839846", "B00000JGEK"], "bought_together": ["0783227078"], "also_viewed": ["6300182150", "B000005PFL", "B00000JKNP", "B00003CXCQ", "B00G5G7EXY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 240790}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.98, "brand": "", "asin": "0783225199", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BZ5ANGQ2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blues Brothers [VHS]"}

Recovering with the aid of a local dwarf (a memorable role for Billy Curtis), the Stranger is hired by the intimidated townsfolk to fend off a band of violent ex-convicts. After teaching the citizens self-defense and instructing them to paint the entire town red and rename it &quot;Hell,&quot; the Stranger vanishes. He reappears when the marauding criminals arrive, and delivers justice and teaches the townsfolk a harsh lesson about moral obligation. Is he a figure from their past or a kind of supernatural avenger?

It's the movie that macho maverick writer-director John Milius was born to make, and Arnold was genetically engineered for his role as the muscle-bound, angst-ridden hero created in Robert E. Howard's pulp novels. Oliver Stone contributed to Milius's screenplay, and the production design by comic artist Ron Cobb represents a perfect cinematic realization of Howard's fantasy world. To avenge the murder of his parents, Conan tracks down the evil Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones) with the help of Queen Valeria (played by buff B-movie vixen Sandahl Bergman) and Subotai the Mongol (Gerry Lopez).

{"description": "Yet another potent (although critically underrated) drama from Jim Sheridan and Daniel Day-Lewis, the Irish director and British star (respectively) ofMy Left FootandIn the Name of the Father. The story focuses on Danny Flynn (Day-Lewis), a promising boxer who had been imprisoned at age 18 for associating with IRA terrorists. After serving a 14-year sentence, he returns to his Belfast neighborhood at a time when local IRA leader Joe Hamill (Brian Cox) is attempting to negotiate a peace treaty with the British. Despite having no further interest in IRA rivalries, Danny finds himself at the center of political and emotional turmoil when he is reunited with his former girlfriend Maggie (Emily Watson, ofBreaking the Waves) who, in Danny's absence, married another IRA man who is now in prison. A strict, unwritten law forbids relationships with the wives of IRA prisoners, but as the former boxer channels his energy into reviving a neighborhood boxing gym, the attraction between Danny and Maggie proves irresistible. This gives a strategic advantage to a militant IRA rival who opposes the peace treaty, drawing Danny back into the bitter and potentially deadly struggle between warring IRA factions. Emphasizing the emotional complexities that arise between Danny and Maggie, this powerful, superbly acted drama demonstrates a sharp understanding of the deep-rooted fears and loyalties that fuel the &quot;troubles&quot; in Ireland, where peace seemed to finally (if tentatively) be achieved in the summer of 1998.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["630310360X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 468133}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.49, "brand": "", "asin": "0783227280", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WD28B954L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Boxer [VHS]"}

Gallo plays Billy Brown, recently released from prison and unable to find so much as a decent bathroom in his cold hometown. Billy's parents are unaware that he's been locked up; in a pathetic attempt to impress them with how successful he's become, he hits on the novel plan of kidnapping young dance student Layla (Ricci) and forcing her to play the role of his wife. Billy's distant--to say the least--parents are played to the hilt by Anjelica Huston and Ben Gazzara, Huston in particular bringing a demented glee to her role as Billy's football-obsessed mother. As the movie unfolds, we learn more about Billy's tormented childhood and unfortunate tendency to bet on the Bills in the Super Bowl. Gallo boldly throws himself into the task of playing a complete sleazebag, and Ricci does lovely standout work as the one ray of hope in the grinding darkness of Billy's life.

{"description": "Woody Allen as a worker ant with an inferiority complex? Sylvester Stallone as an affable soldier ant who discovers that digging tunnels is cool? The animation playground we all knew so well is turning into a theme park full of in-jokes for grownups.Antzexplores age-old topics (one person--err, insect--can make a difference, individuality and social responsibility must exist side by side, war is hell) with comic asides and Woody Allen's funniest quips this side of PG (adults will chuckle at the socialist slogans bandied about as he campaigns for workers' rights). Sharon Stone voices the rebellious princess with a fun-loving streak that doesn't quite overcome her royal bearing and court training, but she can learn. Gene Hackman is all teeth (ants have teeth?) and menacing grins as the Army general plotting insect-icide. This bug's-eye view of life on Earth gives Allen's neurotic nonconformist an epic adventure of microscopic proportions: a devastating war with a termite colony, an odyssey to the fabled land of plenty (a picnic ground), and a race to save his fellow workers from certain death. Other voices include Anne Bancroft as the Queen, Christopher Walken, Jennifer Lopez, Danny Glover, Dan Aykroyd, Jane Curtin, and John Mahoney. The computer animation isn't exactly realistic but feels as solid and contoured as puppet animation with the smoothness and slickness of traditional cel cartoons, and the character designs and animation offer a marvelous range of expressions. The PG rating includes a gritty battle sequence that may frighten youngsters.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00007LVCM", "B0012EM5D8", "B00003CXJ4", "B0006JMLRK", "B000ION23A", "B00005JNQS", "B000MV9026", "B000M343BC", "B000RMJ4F8", "B005SDUV4E", "B0006UEVT0", "B0000640SC", "B004HO6I4M", "B001DPHDCY", "B002WJI2QQ", "B00CWM58WY", "B0000AOX0O", "B00003CXG7", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B005LAIISA", "6305161887", "B00029LO0Y", "B0000VV4W2", "B000AY74OG", "B007FF3HQM", "B008NNY9QW", "B001GCUO7A", "B0039N74CW", "B003E66Y84", "B006JD48LO", "B004EPZ034", "B000L22SG6", "B000H7JCK0", "B001PR0YEE", "B001U3D88M", "B00BTYSIWI", "B00CHVJODE", "B000A2WAQK", "B001LPWGFA", "B003H9M1Q2", "B00000JGOQ", "B0013FSL3E", "B00B7EQPNE", "B001GCUNWQ", "B00AFEX83C", "B000VBJEEG", "B00AEFXMSS", "B00CTNYLQA", "B000065V42", "B000056H26", "B0030IIZ4M", "B001ILFUD2", "B0084IHVGG", "B000CZ0PT4", "B00365F6I2", "B0046A9RMM", "B00E9ZATJO", "B00JK531ES", "B00000JL8E", "B003UMW63E", "B00ALMNCLQ", "B000BITUVG", "B00EBBGLFC", "B0084IHVUC", "B001ECQ75A", "B00004YNUM", "B00005TN8K", "B00AEFYO08", "B005LAIHW2", "B000EQ5UHS", "B000UFIYOO", "B001OMU6UM", "B00009M9BK", "B001NCDFTW", "B000UVKGPI", "B0042U94UQ", "B00009YXAW", "B0013FSWT2", "B005LAIH4A", "B004A8ZX0K", "B000E33W0S", "B000DWMYQ8", "B000AAF1TU", "B00005RDSQ", "B000ROAK2W", "B001ILFUDC", "B000GUJZ00", "0783219806", "B00HLTD2OE", "B000089773", "B001FAFO3W", "B000035Z48", "B0084IHVN4", "B00CQRN3QI", "B001HN6918", "B00005JN4W", "B00004R99S", "B00F522C7C", "B001PR0Y7Q", "B004LWZW7Y"], "bought_together": ["B00007LVCM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00007LVCM", "B00CWM58WY", "B004HO6I4M", "B0011ZNAIC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6637}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.81, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "0783231474", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51iCc1u153L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Antz"}
{"description": "Sydney Pollack's approach to audio commentary for DVD editions of his  films is different from that of most other directors. Instead of detailing each scene ofOut of Africa, for example, Pollack  paints in broad strokes, talking about cinematic themes and in particular the translation of Karen Blixen's life in Africa from book to film. The fan of flubs and trivia won't find Pollack making any cute remarks, but he's  certainly interesting for the run of the film, describing the location shooting in Africa and how he dealt with Robert  Redford's casting and lack of accent. The new 45-minute documentaryA Song of Africahas old and new interviews with Pollack and Meryl Streep, who clearly should have shared the film's commentary duties; she's insightful and quite fun to listen to.

{"description": "Robert Cummings stars as Barry Kane, a patriotic munitions worker who is falsely accused of sabotage, in this wartime thriller from Alfred Hitchcock. Plastered across the front page of every newspaper and hated by the nation, Kane's only hope of clearing his name is to find the real villain. If this sounds a bit like Hitchcock's laterNorth by Northwest, it is. There are interesting echoes throughout, including a heart-stopping sequence on top of a national monument. But the most interesting thing aboutSaboteuris the frequency with which characters demonstrate their willingness to obstruct the police, going on nothing more than the fact that Kane seems like a stand-up guy. They do, again and again, apparently just because good people can spot other good people.Saboteurwas made during the thick of World War II, so there are a few passages of heavy-handed jingoism to get through but they're relatively painless. The script as a whole is a clever one--Algonquin wit Dorothy Parker shares a screenwriting credit, and her trademark zingers make for a terrific mix of humor and suspense.Saboteuris a pleasure whether you're a die-hard Hitchcock fan or just someone who likes a good nail-biter.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300183580", "0783235682"], "also_viewed": ["B001D8W7EA", "B000A1INJE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 450820}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.45, "brand": "", "asin": "0783236344", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5110R9HJEJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Saboteur [VHS]"}
{"description": "Australian director Scott Hicks's follow-up to his widely belovedShinecomes as a small shock. Based on David Guterson'sbestselling novel,Snow Falling on Cedarsis far removed from the  character-driven, pure storytelling ofShineand a comparative plunge  into moody atmospherics. Action insinuates itself  through the director's determined eye for watercolor composition  and free-floating perspective, like random shoots of new growth in an  overwhelming rain forest. It's impossible to be complacent as a viewer  because Hicks's meditative style paradoxically forces one to locate and make  the story happen internally.The approach makes good aesthetic sense in that Guterson's story couches  courtroom drama in dreamy textures, and Hicks is determined to reflect that even if it means turning an audience's idea of narrative on its head. He also  gets a lot of help from the weather in the Pacific Northwest: the setting is  one of Washington State's San Juan Islands, where rain embraces earth and sky in a singular, introverted  personality. There, a Japanese American war hero (Rick Yune) stands  accused of murdering a white fisherman in the years following World  War&nbsp;II. His wife (Youki Kudoh) is the former childhood sweetheart and lover  of a  local newspaperman (Ethan Hawke) whose bitterness over the loss--as well as his helplessness during the internment of  Japanese Americans, and the crusading legacy of his journalist father (Sam  Shepard)--prevents him from coming to the defense of the accused man.Layered emotions, layered sensations, layered clouds. This is historical  fiction of a sort that works best as an experience of time's relativity:  flowing, stopping, trickling. Ironically, the film's most commercial element,  the trial, is the least interesting aspect, though old pro Max Von Sydow  makes those scenes great fun as a wily defense counsel.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EXDSCK", "B000NTPG7A", "067976402X", "B0051HCURS", "B004SIP6C2", "B00005MEVY", "B0009298P2", "B00005JKGK", "B005DCJ1J6", "B004SIP6QI", "0151001006", "B000038IDY", "B005KG4CUS", "B00197POZO", "1586634909", "B001KEHAEE", "B0012OX7EO", "B004SIP83Y", "B000CQLZ8S", "B00083FZFE", "B00FPUN21O", "B004SIP7F8", "0743457579", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B00G15MDI0", "B007RL2R9M", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B003EYVXRS", "B00166UFTS", "B002ZG99EK", "B0013XZ6X4", "B0045HCJRQ", "B000EHRVMY", "B00GUO2SKA", "B000RF7XYO", "B003ASLJQ8", "B000DN5W1G", "B001FB55L2", "B000P5FH3K", "B004UXUUDA", "B000HC2LHG", "B000056KMW", "B00H7LJ2UO", "B004UXUX4Q", "B004AE3QYE", "B009IQG5M4", "B002AT4PA0", "B00H9L26AA", "B008PJZDX2", "B0007OP1XA", "630523650X", "B00G7QPXUI", "B00BTYU3SK", "B00011Y1PI", "B00HLTD49C", "B004VHOAGS", "B00AEFY8MM", "B000BYRCQU", "6305428522", "B000QGEB1M", "B0006TPE4C", "B002OVB9YE", "B00007G1WH", "B004SIP71M", "B0064MT1LM", "0780619587", "B004SUDQ8G", "B000ZOXDFA", "B001CITQWM", "1477513981", "B00AEFXGIY", "0767811100", "B0071HPP3M", "B00GJT2OWS", "B0007QJ210", "B000BOH904", "B00JBGWP3Y", "B004SIP9U6", "B000R4SMCW", "B0007Z0NYQ", "B006FE83UE", "B000KX0IOA", "B004SIP8W0", "B004SEUJ82", "B0002O7XVI", "B001P9KR8U", "B00B4ZN3XQ", "B00028G7IO", "B0009W5IMO", "B004SEUJOQ", "B0001V6ZK2", "B000NOIX48", "B000P0J092", "6305428352", "6304883773", "B00GST8U4U", "B000I0RNV6", "B0064MT1FI", "B00005PJ6V", "B000P0J0AG"], "bought_together": ["067976402X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["067976402X", "B000NTPG7A", "B000EXDSCK", "B00005JKGK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 24564}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.49, "brand": "Universal", "asin": "0783240325", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513NKVN69ML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Snow Falling on Cedars"}

{"description": "Patterns exist everywhere: in nature, in science, in religion, in  business. Max Cohen (played hauntingly by Sean Gullette) is a mathematician searching for these patterns in everything. Yet, he's not the only one, and everyone from Wall Street investors, looking to break the market, to Hasidic Jews, searching for the 216-digit number that reveals the true name of God, are trying to get their hands on Max. This dark, low-budget film was shot in black and white by director Darren Aronofsky. With eerie music, voice-overs, and overt symbolism enhancing the somber mood, Aronofsky has created a disturbing look at the world. Max is deeply paranoid, holed up in his apartment with his computer Euclid, obsessively studying chaos theory.  Blinding headaches and hallucinogenic visions only feed his paranoia as he attempts to remain aloof from the world, venturing out only to meet his mentor, Sol Robeson (Mark Margolis), who for some mysterious reason feels Max should take a break from his research. This movie is complex--occasionallytoocomplex--but the psychological drama and the loose sci-fi elements make this a worthwhile, albeit consuming, watch.Piwon the Director's Award at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival.--Jenny Brown", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 496232}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0784011796", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P5P0C06XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pi [VHS]"}
{"description": "This classic 1963 Disney film features child icon Hayley Mills  as Nancy Carey, a teenage girl whose family moves from Boston  to the New England countryside as a result of their father's untimely  passing.  Nancy writes to the kindly Mr.&nbsp;Poppem (Burl Ives) and  single-handedly convinces him to rent the family a charming, if run-down,  house for a mere $60 a year. Ever the optimist, Nancy brims with  excitement at the family's new life, but this \"perfect world\" has its  problems--notably an absentee landlord who knows nothing about the Carey  family's rental agreement.  Through hard work and Mr.&nbsp;Poppem's continuing  generosity, the Careys fix up the house and find life in the rural Maine  town quite satisfactory.  Things become tense when their cousin Julia arrives  for an extended visit, but eventually Nancy and Julia grow from one  another's experiences and become good friends. You'll never guess what  happens when the absent landlord returns unannounced during the family's  Halloween housewarming party!One section that may sit poorly with modern audiences features Nancy and  Julia discussing how to emphasize one's femininity at the expense of hiding the real you--an indication of how much American thinking has changed in a  relatively short period of time.

{"description": "There's nothing hip about this vintage Disney film that begins and ends with a corny song about the \"best doggone dog in the West.\" But that's the beauty ofOld Yeller, originally released in 1957. The simple, heart-warming story of a boy who bonds with a feisty stray dog in 1860s Texas is full of 1950s sensibilities: A Donna Reed-style perfect \"Momma\" (Dorothy McGuire) who knows best, a couple of brothers who quarrel in the best sitcom tradition, and a father (Fess Parker, in a small role) who goes off to provide for his family, leaving his older boy (Tommy Kirk) in charge and his incredibly cute younger one (Kevin Corcoran) to steal as many scenes in the movie as he possibly can. With Old Yeller at his side, Kirk becomes a little man, who in the end must make a decision so heart-breaking that it's one of filmdom's most memorable moments.--Valerie J.

{"description": "Do you know anyone who hasn't seen this movie? A box-office smash when released in 1993, this spectacular update of the popular 1960s TV series stars Harrison Ford as a surgeon wrongly accused of the murder of his wife. He escapes from a prison transport bus (in one of the most spectacular stunt-action sequences ever filmed) and embarks on a frantic quest for the true killer's identity, while a tenacious U.S. marshal (Tommy Lee Jones, in an Oscar-winning role) remains hot on his trail. Director Andrew Davis hit the big time with this expert display of polished style and escalating suspense, but it's the antagonistic chemistry between Jones and Ford that keeps this thriller cooking to the very end. In roles that seem custom-fit to their screen personas, the two stars maintain a sharply human focus to the grand-scale manhunt, and the intelligent screenplay never resorts to convenient escapes or narrative shortcuts. Equally effective as a thriller and a character study, this is a Hollywood blockbuster that truly deserves its ongoing popularity.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790736411", "0767803434", "B00AEBB9UK", "B00008K76W", "B002NZK5R8", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000055Y0Y", "B00008K76V", "B004IK30MI", "B002NZK5UU", "B000CEV3M8", "B0045HCJ8K", "B00AEFXYJA", "B00008K76U", "0783225733", "B0045HCJFS", "B000O77SRC", "B000F8DV1M", "B00AEBB9NM", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B000EGDB10", "0800141601", "B002AT8K9W", "6305428115", "B0006GANOQ", "B00026ZG10", "6304711891", "B003ASLJIQ", "6304806434", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00AEFYF2K", "B000NTMA0Q", "0783240295", "B002NZK5VO", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00015YVDG", "B00AEBB8YW", "0790732238", "B002GIBVVG", "B00004STDN", "B002AT8KAG", "B00AEFXBG6", "B00AEFXVOI", "B000SFOW8I", "B002VWNICC", "B000U1ZV8K", "B002GHHHP6", "B00009WVSL", "B00008G8M4", "B002AS464Q", "B000PHVZNE", "B003AWRMBA", "0790732149", "B0007IO6NM", "B001ECDVJU", "B00AEBBA2W", "0783226888", "B000QUCRB4", "6305213283", "6304765258", "6304765266", "6305133468", "B00005B6JZ", "B002O3Z50G", "B00000G3PA", "B0043X1FNQ", "B000FO0AA6", "B00003CXGV", "B004AOECXI", "B00096S49Y", "B0014C2FX8", "6305236569", "B003ASLJMW", "B0014Z4OMU", "B000P0J0EM", "0790730979", "B0006N2EZ0", "0783222149", "B001LXIDW2", "0783226942", "B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B00158K0QU", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00AEFXEGS", "0780618548", "0783235070", "B00004XPPG", "B0045HCJGC", "B000FO0A9W", "B0000AOV4I", "B000YCPUWW", "B00177YA1K", "630471193X", "B007SPPANM", "0792844874", "B00081U7HC"], "bought_together": ["0790736411", "0767803434"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000JYW5BE", "B004LWZW4M", "B000UBMSB8", "B0054OGQM8"]}, "price": 17.75, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 201394}, "asin": "079072961X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514VJP0EEHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Fugitive"}
{"description": "Thanks to the ambitious vision of director Tim Burton, the blockbuster hit of 1989 delivers the goods despite an occasionally spotty script, giving the caped crusader a thorough overhaul in keeping with the crime fighter's evolution in DC Comics. Michael Keaton strikes just the right mood as the brooding &quot;Dark Knight&quot; of Gotham City; Kim Basinger plays Gotham's intrepid reporter Vicki Vale; and Jack Nicholson goes wild as the maniacal and scene-stealing Joker, who plots a takeover of the city with his lethal Smilex gas. Triumphant Oscar-winning production design by the late Anton Furst turnsBatmaninto a visual feast, and Burton brilliantly establishes a darkly mythic approach to Batman's legacy. Danny Elfman's now-classic score propels the action with bold, muscular verve.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000P0J06U", "B001OST0LW", "B001OST0M6", "B00005JNJV", "B001GZ6QC4", "B000IJ79UW", "B004LWZWGA", "B00005LOUK", "B001AGXEAG", "B000IJ79WU", "B0000VD04M", "B00005JKCH", "B000IJ79XE", "B00AEBBA72", "B000IJ79X4", "B002VWNIDG", "B004LWZW42", "B00005JMQW", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001CK1D44", "B000J10EQU", "B009JBWOU0", "B0000AC8LI", "B0006L0LOS", "6304698739", "B001VLBDD0", "B001ECDVKE", "B0000959N0", "B008JFUPFI", "B000EGDB10", "B00LBHOCHS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B000OT6V64", "6304711891", "B002VWNID6", "B000AQOHNA", "B000AYELVA", "B00F4FFO8E", "B000A9QKL4", "B00DP9MDE4", "B00005JNTU", "B000BZISVM", "0780630890", "0780630882", "B0014Z4ON4", "B000RW3VCK", "B000P0J0AG", "B0090SI56Y", "B002GSXKN8", "B00005N7Z1", "B000AYELVU", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00005R2IS", "B004FQX5B6", "0790731924", "B00AEBB9NM", "B00007AJGH", "B00005T7I1", "B000P0J0A6", "B000M341QE", "B000P0J09M", "0792844866", "B004SIP95G", "B000VI70QS", "B004L9GMBC", "B00027JZ3E", "B0001BKAEY", "B000A9QKLE", "B0014C2FX8", "B000V4UFZK", "B003XURDAY", "B00008G8M5", "B00070FX5U", "B00GZ0ML2Y", "B000O77SQS", "B004SIP9Z6", "B0007G89FU", "B000UR9T8C", "B001QB9H1U", "B000RTB0R6", "B00177YA1K", "B00008G8M4", "B004SIP9O2", "B00AEBB9FA", "B00005ATZT", "B000FS9FCG", "B0009UZG28", "B000P0J09W", "B001CDR1FG", "B00005N5S5", "6305767866", "B0087F7VSY", "B00081912E", "B001TK80C0", "0780630858", "B004YJMQHI", "B00AEBB9DM", "B007K3JFUQ", "6304712987", "B0001GOH6Q"], "bought_together": ["B000P0J06U", "B001OST0LW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002GSXKN8", "B00005JNJV", "B000B5XOSO", "B00C2IGQBA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 141600}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.0, "brand": "WARNER STUDIOS", "asin": "0790729652", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41SYDPY4YPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Batman (1989)"}
{"description": "Martin Scorsese's 1990 masterpieceGoodFellasimmortalizes the hilarious, horrifying life of actual gangster Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), from his teen years on the streets of New York to his anonymous exile under the Witness Protection Program. The director's kinetic style is perfect for recounting Hill's ruthless rise to power in the 1950s as well as his drugged-out fall in the late 1970s; in fact, no one has ever rendered the mental dislocation of cocaine better than Scorsese. Scorsese uses period music perfectly, not just to summon a particular time but to set a precise mood.GoodFellasis at least as good asThe Godfatherwithout being in the least derivative of it. Joe Pesci's psycho improvisation of Mobster Tommy DeVito ignited Pesci as a star, Lorraine Bracco scores the performance of her life as the love of Hill's life, and every supporting role, from Paul Sorvino to Robert De Niro, is a miracle.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000C20VPA", "B000C20VRS", "B008R65XYC", "B000M341QE", "B0018CMJSU", "B0019L770A", "B0019L21GA", "B00004XPPB", "B000P0J0AG", "B0000DI87S", "B000P0J0EW", "B00003CXWV", "B00CCMKPO0", "B00G1C2URC", "B00004U103", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004SIP95G", "B002CPMB9O", "B0019L21H4", "B007TBIUSM", "B000286RP2", "B00011CZRE", "B004SIP8ZM", "B0006GAOJA", "B002T9H2LA", "B006TTC5HC", "B002VWNIEA", "0767830555", "B0000AMJEK", "B0000AM6JI", "B00005V9HH", "B004FQX5B6", "B000SFOW8I", "B00008975Z", "B002CA68N4", "6305313687", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00013RC2U", "0792174909", "B007D0FVRM", "B000A7DVR2", "B004G7XCRQ", "B002QEHPQU", "B003ASLJO0", "B000LP6KNU", "B000H5TH20", "B000P0J09C", "6305263248", "0783229526", "B00009W5CA", "B001C0I61M", "B000EHSVRI", "B00IEK9U0E", "B002ZG980U", "B004SIP7TE", "B004SIP7ZS", "B0006GAO5Y", "B00B0U2SFE", "B000ERVKBC", "B000A2UBN4", "B002AF4Y9G", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B0000714BS", "B000E5KQHI", "B00005JA8B", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B003AWRMCE", "B000P0J0EM", "1558908390", "B00080ZG10", "0767802519", "B003ELKNH2", "B003BV8I3Q", "B000035Z5G", "B00AEFXDO6", "B000E8NRBC", "B00000JGHV", "B00004RJ71", "B00AEBB9CS", "B004SIP93S", "B00AEFYSEA", "B004SIP6WW", "B003ASLJQS", "B0001Z4OXS", "B002VWNIDG", "0783225946", "B00AEBB9ZK", "B00AEFXXMI", "B0000A02TZ", "B000MZHW40", "B004SIP6GI", "B002ZG99N6", "B00AEBB95K", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00BB67UNW", "B00029RTAI", "B000P0J0D8", "B003ASLJOU", "B000Z8GZYW", "B003ASLJS6"], "bought_together": ["B000C20VPA", "B000C20VRS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000M341QE", "B0018CMJSU", "B000P0J0EW", "B00BCB1JJW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 120285}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.49, "brand": "WARNER STUDIOS", "asin": "0790729725", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YHNBJW24L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "GoodFellas"}
{"description": "Stanley Kubrick'sThe Shiningis less an adaptation of Stephen King's bestselling horror novel than a complete reimagining of it from the inside out. In King's book, the Overlook Hotel is a haunted place that takes possession of its off-season caretaker and provokes him to murderous rage against his wife and young son. Kubrick's movie is an existential Road Runner cartoon (his steadicam scurrying through the hotel's labyrinthine hallways), in which the cavernously empty spaces inside the Overlook mirror the emptiness in the soul of the blocked writer, who's settled in for a long winter's hibernation. As many have pointed out, King's protagonist goes mad, but Kubrick's Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is Looney Tunes from the moment we meet him--all arching eyebrows and mischievous grin. (Both Nicholson and Shelley Duvall reach new levels of hysteria in their performances, driven to extremes by the director's fanatical demands for take after take after take.)The Shiningis terrifying--but not in the way fans of the novel might expect. When it was redone as a TV miniseries (reportedly because of King's dissatisfaction with the Kubrick film), the famous topiary-animal attack (which was deemed impossible to film in 1980) was there--but the deeper horror was lost. Kubrick'sThe Shininggets under your skin and chills your bones; it stays with you, inhabits you, haunts you. And there's no place to hide...--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300267881", "0790734079", "B00005ATQA", "6302038308", "6300182770", "B0009RRUKW", "0783235607", "0783228317", "B00000J2KZ", "B00004RNAC", "0790736039", "B00023NRSM", "6304508611", "6300182878", "6302921058", "6304509154", "0783216084", "6300214087", "B00004W5UA", "6301427076", "630268644X", "B000003KHS", "B000AMW2TK", "0790700506", "6300181340", "6300214753", "6302054982", "0784011923", "6305363668", "6303686796", "6305095566", "630021639X", "6302822688", "6305576173", "0783246641", "6304994540", "6303953425", "B00004U8PA", "0792158261", "0792100085", "6300213986", "6300189015", "630533577X", "6300214826", "0792846303", "6304288433", "6300147630", "0792842111", "B000007OY0", "0790741512", "6302158176", "0792846311", "6300183416", "0800103106", "B000005PFL", "6300183211", "0790733927", "6301666569", "6301871952", "0767825411", "630339406X", "6303109950", "6300216500", "6300214192", "6300262731", "6303257674", "6304214502", "630018627X", "6300214311", "1558807381", "0792839234", "0767819187", "B00005B238", "0790731975", "6303579388", "B000059HFB", "6302798450", "B00000FZCU", "6303651461", "6303566391", "6302642175", "6301971582", "6300218058", "6301094352", "6300184064", "6300181278", "6304457383", "6300214672", "6300262855", "0800125762", "6303257305"], "bought_together": ["0790734079"], "also_viewed": ["6300147630", "6300182878", "B00005ATQA", "6300189015", "6300267881", "B00023NRSM", "6300213005", "6303953425", "0307743659", "6303148352", "0790734079", "B001AQT0Z4", "6300183211", "0784011923", "B00BBND56G", "0788806270"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 268792}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0790705141", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5106FV0S4PL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Shining [VHS]"}
{"description": "EDITOR'S NOTE: According to a Warner Home Video technician involved in  the production ofThe Stanley Kubrick Collection, Kubrick authorized all aspects of theCollection, from the use of Digital Component Video (or \"D-1\") masters originally approved in 1989, to the use of minimalist screen menus, chapter stops, and (in the case of2001: A Space OdysseyandThe Shiningon DVD) supplementary materials. Full-screen presentation ofThe ShiningandFull Metal Jacketwas also approved by Kubrick, who recomposed his original framing,  reportedly believing that those films looked best on video in the full-screen format. (In fact, the original theatrical aspect ratio ofThe Shiningwas 1.66:1, meaning that a relatively small portion of the image is lost.) Kubrick also chose mono over stereo,  believing that inconsistencies in theatrical sound systems resulted in loss of control over theatrical presentation. In every respect, the Warner spokesman  said, the films in theCollectionremain as Kubrick approved them. Any future attempt to remaster or alter them would  have to be approved by an appointee of the Kubrick estate.", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301115430", "6300214826", "630018627X", "6304935811", "6301979761", "B00006C7G9", "B00000J2L7", "0784011923", "0790748169", "630407185X", "0800132009", "6302816580", "6301208773", "B00000JGEI", "B000BT8VVK", "B00000IO4G", "630018224X", "0792133153", "6300248135", "6302054982", "630300394X", "B00000K3AN", "6303696813", "6303020089", "6302415853", "6304826133", "6303029027", "0783235607", "6304259131", "B000065JH1", "0800179552", "6301217977", "B00007CVYA", "0800116917", "B0000CDL3W", "6304214502", "6302935148", "6304414099", "6303168507", "076783819X", "6300248089", "0800125762", "630018403X", "6300213005", "6303269834", "6303109950", "6300246965", "B00006IUOZ", "6300183211", "6304925131", "0783202253", "0783107986", "079213690X", "B000005XXG", "B00000FZCU", "0800187873", "6300214540"], "bought_together": ["6301115430", "6300214826"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 348239}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0790701251", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZM1C6TC7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Full Metal Jacket [VHS]"}

{"description": "One of the funniest films in many a moon was hiding at art house  theaters in 1998. FormerSaturday Night Livecomedian and Spinal Tap member Christopher Guest creates the ultimate parody of small-town dramatics,Waiting for Guffman.

The mockumentary follows the various townsfolk wishing for stardom: Parker Posey as a Dairy Queen clerk, Catherine O'Hara and Fred Willard as stage-struck travel agents, Matthew Keeslar as the town's bad boy, and Eugene Levy (who cowrote the film with Guest) as a dentist who dreams of glory on the stage.

{"description": "A favorite film of some of the world's greatest filmmakers, including Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg, John Ford'sThe Searchershas earned its place in the legacy of great American films for a variety of reasons. Perhaps most notably, it's the definitive role for John Wayne as an icon of the classic Western--the hero (or antihero) who must stand alone according to the unwritten code of the West. The story takes place in Texas in 1868; Wayne plays Ethan Edwards, a Confederate veteran who visits his brother and sister-in-law at their ranch and is horrified when they are killed by marauding Comanches. Ethan's search for a surviving niece (played by young Natalie Wood) becomes an all-consuming obsession. With the help of a family friend (Jeffrey Hunter) who is himself part Cherokee, Ethan hits the trail on a five-year quest for revenge. At the peak of his masterful talent, director Ford crafts this classic tale as an embittered examination of racism and blind hatred, provoking Wayne to give one of the best performances of his career. As with many of Ford's classic Westerns,The Searchersmust contend with revisionism in its stereotypical treatment of \"savage\" Native Americans, and the film's visual beauty (the final shot is one of the great images in all of Western culture) is compromised by some uneven performances and stilted dialogue. Still, this is undeniably one of the greatest Westerns ever made.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300268470", "630197705X", "0792106989", "6301325508", "0782008348", "6303057225", "6300181588", "6300268799", "0792102320", "6301797922", "6301802330", "6303192254", "0792838556", "6301805518", "6304071876", "6301798759", "6300184951", "6300269884", "6300267830", "1555265952", "6300181715", "0792107128", "6303599052", "6300208281", "0783221347", "B00004RFFA", "6304457308", "6304457278", "079284517X", "6301977165", "6300268748", "B000051S3Z", "B001E419N8", "B000M7BEPQ", "B000GX4476", "0792110188", "6301628454", "6300988473", "0800132009", "B000059HGY", "6301805615", "B00004WZR1", "6301670159", "0792107683", "630310374X", "0783235607", "6303942830", "6302884438", "6305237115", "630150528X", "0792834879", "0790743213", "0783235593", "6304259131", "6301798503", "630018224X", "6302130379", "B000006N70", "6304935811"], "also_viewed": ["6303599052", "6303168507", "6300269884", "6301802330", "0792106989"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 293111}, "asin": "0790736918", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G79RSPRAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Searchers [VHS]"}
{"description": "Winner of the Academy Award&reg; for best picture of 1989, this gracefully moving drama, adapted from the hit play by Alfred Uhry, chronicles the 25-year friendship between a stubborn, aging Southern widow (Jessica Tandy) and her loyal chauffeur (Morgan Freeman). At first, the self-sufficient Miss Daisy is reluctant to accept the services of a chauffeur, but Hoke is quiet, wise, and tolerant, and as the years pass the unlikely friends develop a deep mutual respect and admiration. Tandy deservedly won the Oscar for her sassy and sensitive performance, and Freeman earned an Oscar nomination for bringing quiet depth and integrity to his memorable role. Ironically, director Bruce Beresford (Tender Mercies) was not nominated, but the film won Oscars for makeup and for Uhry's screenplay, in addition to a supporting actor nomination for Dan Aykroyd as Daisy's supportive son. Delicate, funny, and bittersweet,Driving Miss Daisywas a surprise hit when released, and marked the crowning achievement of Tandy's great career.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305212112", "B0000JBALO", "B00004TJKK", "076780676X", "B00005NRN8", "B003ASLJK4", "B00AEBB9FA", "0783240171", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000P0J092", "B00001W9G0", "B004A8ZWVK", "B006FE83UE", "B000765IJK", "B004SIP7F8", "B001VC99HQ", "B00DDT0JB0", "B00AEFXYOA", "B000TXP56C", "B004SEUJOQ", "B000YAF4MA", "B004FQX5A2", "B001ECDVJU", "0767836359", "B003LMPKSQ", "B00AEFXD1O", "B002M2Z3BA", "B004AOECXI", "B00AEFY4CG", "6305128952", "0800141806", "B00004XPPC", "B00005MEOU", "B002NZK5RS", "B0045HCJ76", "B00006G8GZ", "B008B9JTFO", "B000JYW5B4", "B001ECDVK4", "6305236569", "6305428352", "B00AFEYJ80", "B000XJD34I", "6305133468", "B001NLJ3NU", "B00AEFYK5M", "B002VWNICM", "B00AATV07S", "B00020HAV0", "B007SPPANM", "B00020HAWE", "B000PHVZNE", "B002VECM6S", "B000065FJC", "B002VWNIAY", "B00011D1OU", "B00006RCO2", "B004SIP6C2", "B0010AN7Z4", "B000E6ESI0", "B0045HCJJY", "B0000YTP02", "6305213283", "B000EHRVOW", "6304907729", "B00K6D1QV8", "B00404ME1A", "B000JU8H9C", "B00EV4EUT8", "B000059HAN", "B00005AUKE", "B0009S4IKQ", "B005HWAOP2", "B007N31YH0", "B00AEFY9GW", "B000QQLVPQ", "B000KJTGHO", "B00AEBBACM", "630471193X", "B000244GCW", "B002HK9IDQ", "B000YDBPAM"], "bought_together": ["6305212112", "B0000JBALO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000JBALO", "6305212112", "B00DDT0JB0", "B003ASLJK4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 77014}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790730987", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4161YA15GNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Driving Miss Daisy"}

{"description": "Mel Gibson's Oscar-winning 1995Braveheartis an impassioned epic about William Wallace, the 13th-century Scottish leader of a popular revolt against England's tyrannical Edward I (Patrick McGoohan). Gibson cannily plays Wallace as a man trying to stay out of history's way until events force his hand, an attribute that instantly resonates with several of the actor's best-known roles, especiallyMad Max. The subsequent camaraderie and courage Wallace shares in the field with fellow warriors is pure enough and inspiring enough to bring envy to a viewer, and even as things go wrong for Wallace in the second half, the film does not easily cave in to a somber tone. One of the most impressive elements is the originality with which Gibson films battle scenes, featuring hundreds of extras wielding medieval weapons. After Eisenstein'sAlexander Nevsky, Orson Welles'sChimes at Midnight, and even Kenneth Branagh'sHenry V, you might think there is little new that could be done in creating scenes of ancient combat; yet Gibson does it.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004XPQ6", "B00003CXE6", "6303953425", "6304935811", "B0001VL30O", "B000054OW2", "6302415853", "0790741512", "6304071876", "6301792734", "6303168507", "6303942830", "0800125762", "6300183211", "B000007OY0", "B000056BRF", "6300214540", "B000065U6Q", "B00004WIDB", "B00003CXTF", "B00007KK15", "079070546X", "B0000A36J1", "B00000K3AN", "6302482712", "6300263673", "6305169187", "0788811355", "B00003BE3X", "0800116917", "6304414099", "6303020089", "0792133153", "0790744589", "6302909023", "0800132009", "079212569X", "6300185095", "6303313345", "0767819462", "6304259131", "B00000K2SC", "0800199421", "B0001DI5W6", "B00005JLTM", "630018224X", "0790701251", "6304151306", "6303696813", "0790731274", "0792147618", "B00005RIJ3", "6301586026", "6302945089", "0783223218", "6305718792"], "bought_together": ["B00004XPQ6", "B00003CXE6"], "also_viewed": ["0792151712", "6303314015", "6301966988", "6303402348", "B00004WIDB", "0792116887", "6300213668", "0800125762", "B00004XPQ6", "0792842111", "B00003CXTF", "0788812408", "6302526574", "6303215734", "0788806270", "6300183211", "B00004U8P4", "0788802194"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 521725}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.5, "brand": "", "asin": "0792139771", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PF2QYK62L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Braveheart (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "The only remaining evidence that Sylvester Stallone might have had a respectable career, this 1976 Oscar winner (for Best Picture, Director, and Editing) is still the quintessential ode to an underdog and one of the best boxing movies ever made. After writing the script about a two-bit boxer who gets a &quot;million-to-one shot&quot; against the world heavyweight champion, Stallone insisted that he star in the title role, and his equally unknown status helped to catapult him (and this rousing film) to overnight success. The story is familiar, but it has been handled with such vitality and emotional honesty that you can't help but leap and cheer for Rocky Balboa, the chump turned champ (despite his valiant defeat in the ring) who stuns the boxing world with the support of his timid girlfriend, Adrian (Talia Shire), and grizzled trainer, Gus (Burgess Meredith). Oscar nominations went to all the lead actors (including Burt Young as Adrian's hot-tempered brother), but four sequels could never top the universal appeal of this low-budget crowd pleaser.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006GAOG8", "B0006GAO6I", "B0006GAOGI", "B000N4SHPS", "B0006GAOGS", "B007STBUHI", "B00005MEOU", "B000ICM5O4", "B00AEFY0F2", "6304907729", "B00004W221", "B000IJ79UW", "B00000HZY2", "B007N31YH0", "B00004XPPC", "B004FQX5A2", "B0014Z4OMU", "B00003CXBU", "B0008JIJ2E", "B000XJD34I", "B007SPPANM", "B000ARTN3I", "B0001US8F8", "B000KX0IOA", "B003ASLJQI", "0792843592", "0780021312", "B00079Z9VO", "B00J2AU8MY", "B001LXIDVI", "B0068FZ0GK", "B00AEBB9FA", "B000BYA4HE", "B000EHRVOW", "B00006ADD5", "B0010AN7Z4", "B00066FBQG", "B000BITV92", "B0087ZG7HK", "B000IJ79WU", "B000059H9A", "B000ZM1MG4", "B0002WZTOI", "B0001US66Y", "B0049985XW", "B001GZ6QC4", "B000VECAD0", "B006FE83UE", "0792838041", "0800177258", "B004SIP7F8", "B00005JKCH", "B00AEFY6DI", "B00008K76U", "B00AEBB9F0", "B001AEF6BS", "B00004BZIY", "B004QBWU02", "B0060ZJ7BC", "B00011D1OK", "B00004TVUD", "B000HE2ZUW"], "bought_together": ["B0006GAOG8", "B0006GAO6I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000WC3A0S", "B004FQX5C0", "B00J4BW10S", "B000N4SHPS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 405226}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.85, "brand": "", "asin": "079283321X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AP5MY2B5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rocky (1976)"}

{"description": "The first feature film to be photographed and projected in the panoramic three-camera Cinerama process, this epic Western is almost as expansive as the West itself, chronicling a pioneering family's triumphs and tragedies in numerous episodes spanning three generations and a half century of westward movement. Divided into five segments directed by veteran Hollywood filmmakers Henry Hathaway, George Marshall, and the legendary John Ford (and including uncredited sequences directed by Richard Thorpe), the film was one of the most ambitious ever made by the venerable MGM studio. Its stellar cast reads like a virtual who's who of Hollywood's biggest stars. Debbie Reynolds plays a sturdy survivor of many pioneering dangers, and the eventual widow of a gambler (Gregory Peck), who is later reunited with her nephew (George Peppard), a Civil War veteran and cavalryman who heads for San Francisco as the transcontinental railroad is being built. Many more characters and stories are woven throughout this epic film, which is dramatically uneven but totally engrossing with its stunning vistas and countless outdoor locations in Illinois, Kentucky, South Dakota, Monument Valley in Arizona, California, Colorado, and elsewhere.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008CMT3", "B000056H2H", "B00E3QJ8DC", "B006VRRGOO", "B00AEFXUL2", "6304696612", "B00009AVA5", "B000O599Y4", "B00BXTDVEO", "B000O59A0C", "B00AEFYL6K", "B000O599ZS", "B0082LUFA4", "0783228031", "B000O77LY2", "B000O599NK", "078322592X", "B00393SG0G", "B0045HCJSK", "B000ANVPP6", "B000OT6V0U", "B00BGQ2P9G", "B00008CMR6", "B000FTCLQC", "B000O599YE", "B00008MTW5", "B0009ML2KQ", "B00AEFYPHA", "B00AEBB8YM", "B00AEBB932", "B000O599YY", "B005GZ2CWS", "B00008MTW6", "B000ANVPPQ", "B009YX8MSG", "B000G6N0HI", "B007Y1NR1W", "B000BT96DW", "B00J9BZ4KC", "B00BAXTY7G", "B00004TJQK", "B00004ZBVE", "B00AMDA2OY", "B00004XMV9", "B000O599NA", "B00E4DJK78", "B00BFWKE62", "B0007US7FI", "B000O599WQ", "0783230478", "B000O599VM", "B000059TFU", "B000NQRR34", "B00AEFYBA6", "B0009ML2JC", "B00008MTW7", "B00AEFY6ZQ", "B00C3ALLPS", "B000056H2E", "B000QRI1GW", "B000031EGW", "B000O599ZI", "B00IU6HPIQ", "B000N3T0GY", "B000O599YO", "B003ASLJRC", "B003NF97MQ", "B00FNR9YY8", "B00005PJ8S", "0792838408", "B0001Z3I0I", "B00A92MCNW", "B0007PALM0", "B00AEFXSVE", "B005AMJ38S", "B000BPL2FG", "B009INAI02", "B0014BJ1A4", "B00CFHEE08", "B00005ASGH", "B0007MANZI", "B001B187NO", "B00132D7Y0", "B004GSVX8A", "B0007MANYY", "B004DY1VIO", "B0009X75WE", "B001D7T6BI"], "bought_together": ["B00008CMT3", "B000056H2H"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BXTDVEO", "B00J9BZ4KC", "B000056H2H", "B00IU6HPIQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 315351}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 30.49, "brand": "", "asin": "0792839072", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61HH9Y5XTJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "How the West Was Won"}

{"description": "Larry McMurtry's novel was a sequel toThe Last Picture Show, picking up with the same characters in the 1980s, after the Texas oil boom had gone bust. Peter Bogdanovich, down on his luck, was tapped to direct and managed to reassemble much of the original cast: Jeff Bridges, Cybill Shepherd, Timothy Bottoms, Cloris Leachman, and Randy Quaid. WherePicture Showfocused on Bottoms's character, this episode centers on Bridges. Fending off creditors, dealing badly with middle age, and drinking too much, he reconnects with Shepherd when she returns to town. But there's not a lot of plot; rather, this is a meditation on the disappointments life can hand out. Bridges, as always, is solid; Bottoms, something of a lost soul in his acting career, seems typecast as the achiever who never recovered from the shell shock of the Korean War. Still, an interesting companion piece to the first film.--Marshall Fine", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 355856}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Texasville [VHS]", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767827902"], "also_viewed": ["0767827902"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BP5X5HHJL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "0792840100"}

Heart-wrenching, touching and \"filled with emotional dynamite\" (The Hollywood Reporter), it remains \"one of the best films about war veterans ever made\" (American Movie Classics).  *1946: Director, Actor, Supporting Actor, Writing/Screenplay, Film Editing, Music/Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00011D1OU", "B00006RCO3", "B00006RCO2", "B0000549B1", "B00005JKF6", "B0009S4IKQ", "B000BITV92", "B0006HBV3W", "B00AEFY6DI", "B00011D1OK", "B00012FXJ0", "B000BYA4HE", "B000KJTGHO", "0780021312", "B001GUYAZY", "B0006B2AA6", "B001D8W7EU", "B00006RCO1", "B0004Z322O", "B00005AUKB", "B0087ZG7OI", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B0002KPHZ6", "B00003CXBU", "B002VWNIAY", "B00AEFXD1O", "B00AEBB89C", "B0009NZ2OW", "B00004TVUD", "B00004XPPC", "B0010AN7Z4", "B00AEFZDNA", "B00006AUGN", "B000067IVZ", "B000XJD34I", "B001GLX6TY", "B007I1Q50I", "B000CNESN0", "B00005AUKE", "B00D3K357O", "B00AEBB932", "0792833287", "B0008ENIKM", "B0002XNT08", "B000CCW2SY", "B0007PALUM", "B000083C6R", "B0045HCJQM", "6304907729", "B000JU8H9M", "B001JPQWSE", "B00008LDNZ", "B00AATUZQA", "B0049985XW", "B008D1Q1VU", "B000085EFE", "B000HWZ4C0", "B003ZEQMH8", "B00K6D1QV8", "B0008ENIAC", "B002VWNIBI", "B0045HCJJY", "B0000DJZ8Q", "B0007US7FI", "B00003Q433", "B00AEBBA7W", "B00366E07E", "B000O78L0U", "B000FZETR0", "B0045HCJ9E", "1594204306", "B006FE83UE", "B0045HCJQW", "B000AP04M4", "B00006ADD5", "6304712936", "B00005PJ8S", "B001GLX6UI", "B000KGGJ1I", "B001EOQCMG", "B00008DDGW", "B0087ZG7R0", "B002M2Z3BA", "B00EOBB866", "B000ION7A8", "B000EU1Q1I", "B001D8W7EK", "B00407PNWO", "B0050FXDDQ", "B00004XMV9", "B000BYA4II", "B00AEFYBA6", "B003WH765U", "B0001US8F8", "B007IU8Z5W", "B00AEBB8OC", "B000056H2H", "0312342357", "B00005JKGX", "B00AEFYSWM"], "bought_together": ["B00011D1OU", "B00006RCO3"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00006RCO3", "B00011D1OU", "B0006B2AA6", "B0000AM6IY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 83540}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 23.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0792846133", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51aHCyw38-L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Best Years of Our Lives"}
{"description": "Truman Capote's extraordinary nonfiction book about the course of two killers in this world--their lives, their senseless slaughter of an entire family, their executions--was faithfully adapted for the screen in this 1967 film by Richard Brooks (Deadline USA,The Blackboard Jungle). Robert Blake and Scott Wilson are remarkable as the murderers, but what has kept this film special over the decades is Brooks's blunt, clearheaded, and nonsensational approach to the story. (The term \"semidocumentary\" has been applied to Brooks's style on this film, and it's an entirely fair description.) The experience of watchingIn Cold Bloodis naturally unsettling, but the director--as with Capote--leaves final judgments about justice to the beholder.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305263213"], "bought_together": ["6305263213"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 379007}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0800113268", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MMT7WJEBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "In Cold Blood [VHS]"}
{"description": "Here's a model for adapting a novel into a movie. The bestseller by James Jones, a frank and hard-hitting look at military life, could not possibly be made into a film in 1953 without considerably altering its length and bold subject matter. Yet screenwriter Daniel Taradash and director Fred Zinnemann (both of whom won Oscars for their work) pared it down and cleaned it up, without losing the essential texture of Jones's tapestry. The setting is an army base in Hawaii in 1941. Montgomery Clift, in a superb performance, plays a bugler who refuses to fight for the company boxing team; he has reasons for giving up the sport. His refusal results in harsh treatment from the company commander, whose bored wife (Deborah Kerr) is having an affair with the tough-but-fair sergeant (Burt Lancaster). You remember--the scene with the two of them embracing on the beach, as the surf crashes in. The supporting players are as good as the leads: Frank Sinatra and Donna Reed won Oscars (and Sinatra revitalized his entire career), and Ernest Borgnine entered the gallery of all-time movie villains, as the stockade sergeant who makes Sinatra miserable. Zinnemann's work is efficient but also evocative, capturing the time and place beautifully, the tropical breezes as well as the lazy prewar indulgence. This one is deservedly a classic.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305261296", "6302226899", "6302413435", "6305123616", "079284517X", "6302413400", "0783221347", "0783222955", "B000005PPB", "0800113055", "6301586026", "6303057225", "6300215644", "6303402070", "6300215741", "0790743159", "6301976983", "6302877873", "B0000048YM", "630150528X", "0793910323", "6302000661", "1558807780", "6300216012", "6302120624", "6302842263", "6302700949", "6302360978", "6300246965", "6304111398", "6301628454", "6304291698", "0800132009", "6301578805", "6301706587", "6301975987", "6300216721", "6302593220", "6301670140", "630442972X", "0792107683", "6301670159", "6304359705", "6301955293", "6301798503", "6301976622", "6301599225", "1558808590", "B00000F13M", "6300183890", "6300267865", "0792101448", "6301797957", "6301973232", "0782008348", "6301564456", "0792110269", "6301798732", "B000M5BRX2", "6301969294", "0783235623", "6302484391", "0790743213", "6300215962", "6300147355", "630266232X", "6300182304", "6303282237", "0792841026", "0790733935", "0792837967", "6301959728", "0783236352", "6302779782", "6302640504", "B0000048YO", "6304383169", "6302238331", "6301640667", "6300214826", "6300181421", "6303029027", "6300181340", "6304429274", "0792837096", "6301973259", "6303560040", "6302753198", "6304056915", "0792837630", "6303943004", "6302797713", "0782006779", "6301798759", "6302278929", "6300246868", "630533577X", "0792837649", "6304935811", "0800100816"], "bought_together": ["6305123616"], "also_viewed": ["6304117752", "0783222955", "0783221347", "6303215734", "6304429274"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 203870}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0800100832", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4157079C8HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "From Here to Eternity [VHS]"}

The character's troubles don't end there, however: Her ex-husband is posing a threat, and a perverted congressman (Burt Reynolds) is looking for more than a lap dance. Bergman's great wit is nowhere in sight, and the film primarily becomes another opportunity for Moore to function like a special effect.

Set at an upper-crust seaside resort, the 1971 film recounts Bathory's plot to replace her current consort (Andrea Rau) with a fresher specimen, an abused newlywed whose brutal young husband is an inconvenience waiting to be eliminated. Although both the bi-sex and the neck-biting violence are tame by today's standards, the film has a graceful, gliding sense of pace that gets under your skin; something unspeakably kinky always seems to be just about to happen.

{"description": "In the 1960s and early '70s, Claude Chabrol was celebrated as the Gallic Hitchcock for his crisp, character-rich thrillers.La  C&eacute;r&eacute;monie, his 1997 hit adapted from Ruth Rendell's novelA Judgement in Stone, is a return to form, an assured domestic drama set in the upper-class household of the kind but condescending Lelievres family. Sandrine Bonnaire, excellent in an enigmatic, uncommunicative role, stars as their new, neurotically silent maid Sophie. She performs her duties efficiently and emotionlessly, staring out from behind an implacable, mask-like face born of loneliness and defensiveness. Isabelle Huppert is the town's gleefully misanthropic postmistress Jeanne, a gossipy, energetically insolent misfit who hates the Lelievres. When she becomes Sophie's best friend, her pathological game of taunts and gossip goes into overdrive with her sudden access to their house, and an already simmering class conflict boils over in unleashed anger. Chabrol charts the cascade of mischief and misunderstandings to its shattering conclusion, with a sensitivity to character and an eagle-eyed remove that makes the explosive climax all the more chilling. It's a devastating thriller, one of Chabrol's best, and a powerful portrait in hate and psychosis pushed over the edge in misunderstanding, manipulation, and mistrust. Jacqueline Bisset is the fumbling but sincere Mme. Lelievres, Jean-Pierre Cassel her complacent husband, and Virginie Ledoyen (A Single Girl) their sensitive young daughter.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00007G1XG", "B000056PL3"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 475611}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.88, "brand": "", "asin": "1567301274", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21A766FTA1L.jpg", "title": "La Ceremonie [VHS]"}

{"description": "Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut's third feature, though it's named for the two  best friends who become virtually inseparable in pre-World War&nbsp;I Paris, is  centered on Jeanne Moreau's Catherine, the most mysterious, enigmatic woman in his career-long gallery of rich female portraits. Adapted from the novel by Henri-Pierre Roch&eacute;, Truffaut's picture explores the 30-year friendship between Austrian biologist Jules (Oskar Werner) and Parisian writer Jim (Henri Serre) and the love triangle formed when the alluring Catherine makes the duo a trio. Spontaneous and lively, a woman of intense but dynamic emotions, she becomes the axle on which their friendship turns as Jules woos her and they marry, only to find that no one man can hold her. Directed in bursts of concentrated scenes interspersed with montage sequences and pulled together by the commentary of an omniscient narrator, Truffaut layers his tragic drama with a wealth of detail. He draws on his bag of New Wave tricks for the carefree days of youth--zooms, flash cuts, freeze frames--that disappear as the marriage disintegrates during the gloom of the postwar years. Werner is excellent as Jules, a vibrant young man whose slow, melancholy slide into emotional compromise is charted in his increasingly sad eyes and resigned face, while Serre plays Jim as more of an enigma, guarded and introspective. But both are eclipsed in the glare of Moreau's radiant Catherine: impulsive, demanding, sensual, passionate, destructive, and ultimately unknowable. A masterpiece of the French New Wave and one of Truffaut's most confident and accomplished films.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["1572524448"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 485144}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.97, "brand": "", "asin": "1572525851", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NEMNZZ25L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jules and Jim [VHS]"}

{"description": "In 1941, Barbara Stanwyck was offered two screwball roles equally suited to her tart intelligence, deft comic timing, and undeniable sex appeal, and it's a photo finish as to which was funnier--showgirl-on-the-lam Sugarpuss O'Shea, the title character in Howard Hawks'sBall of Fire, or con artist Jean Harrington a.k.a. Lady Eve Sidwich, the delirious fulcrum for this classic Preston Sturges comedy. Under Sturges's typically antic microscope, the collision between the gold-digging Harrington and the very rich, very hapless brewery-heir-turned-herpetologist Charles Pike (a wonderfully callow, guileless Henry Fonda) yields ample opportunity for the writer-director to skewer issues of class and sex; as always, Sturges is bold in pushing the censors' envelope, capturing a palpable erotic heat between the canny Jean and the literally feverish Charlie, who, after a year up the Amazon, is instantly smitten by the mere sight of her shapely ankles (in hindsight, a precursor to her subsequent effect inDouble Indemnity). To give away the plot machinations driving the farce would spoil the fun, beyond confirming impersonations, mixed signals, and misunderstandings as the turns in a consistently rollicking ride that makes good use of Charles Coburn and screwball character veterans Eugene Pallette, William Demarest, and Eric Blore.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB9EG", "0792844564", "6303391931", "630365164X", "6303383009", "B00156HZM4", "B006P0UQ2G", "6301972171", "B000021Y6M", "6303364772", "6302224365", "6301965760", "6303393985", "6301977181", "6301805615", "6301969081", "1558807780", "6300185206", "6301232291", "0783228074", "6300209741", "630266232X", "6301976282", "6303631851", "6301978390"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 314886}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6300185125", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GXV4Y7KJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lady Eve [VHS]"}

Preppie commodities trader Dan Aykroyd (perfectly cast) is stripped of all his worldly goods and expelled from the firm, and Murphy's smelly derelict is appointed to take his place, graduating to tailored suits and a world-class harem in record time. Eventually the two men team up to teach the nasty old manipulators a lesson, cornering the market in frozen orange juice futures in the process.

{"description": "That Oscar-winning title song buzzes in your ears long after the movie has stopped. The attraction here is youthful spirit and a pulsating score, because the weak story is merely a conduit for the song-and-dance numbers. The plot is every young woman's daydream come true. Jennifer Beals holds down a macho job as a welder by day, but performs erotic dance numbers in a club at night. It's not a strip club, so her morality remains intact. She dates her wealthy boss (Michael Nouri) and practices hard for the day she can audition for the upscale, local dance school, even though she has no formal training. It is malarkey, of course, unless you view this as total romantic fantasy. It works because you are carried along by the sheer force of the energetic, boisterous, MTV-style imagery by director Adrian Lyne. Beals is a plus as the stubborn, pouty, somewhat eccentric young woman made all the more interesting for her driving ambition. In the end, she is aided by her Prince Charming, who arrives bearing favors. Mind you, this is not the same as a rescue, as Beals is one rather tough damsel who does just fine on her own.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["630287789X", "6300263673", "6300183211", "6300182916", "6300213668", "0792100085"], "bought_together": ["B000009CMK"], "also_viewed": ["6300263673"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 175909}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.45, "brand": "", "asin": "6300214184", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K5Z4QMFFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Flashdance [VHS]"}
{"description": "This splatter flick, along with John Carpenter'sHalloween, helped spawn the great horror-movie movement of the '80s, not to mentioneightsequels, many of which had nothing to do with the films that preceded them. It also gave birth to Jason Voorhees, one of the three biggest horror-movie psychos of the modern era (the other two beingHalloween's Michael Myers andA Nightmare on Elm Street's Freddy Krueger). Forever duplicated, the originalFriday the 13thpopularized a number of themes and techniques that today are now clich&eacute;s: the increasingly gory murders, the remote forest location, the anonymous and nubile cast, the murderer as cult hero, and, of course, the moral that if you have sex, you will die, very painfully. Still, if you have to see aFriday the 13thmovie, this is the one to check out. A group of eager (and horny) teenagers decide to reopen Camp Crystal Lake, which 20 years earlier was closed after the shocking and mysterious murders of two amorous camp counselors. You can take it from there, as the teens get picked off one by one, during a dark and stormy night; of course, their car won't start and there's no phone.

Well,The Nutty Professorcertainly is Lewis's best film. But all one has to do is watch it to realize the motivation behind Buddy Love is more confessional: he's really much more like Lewis's darker, narcissistic side, while the shlubby scientist (also played by Lewis) from whom Love springs is closer to the star's screen image.

{"description": "Francis Ford Coppola took some of the deep background from the life of Mafia chief Vito Corleone--the patriarch of Mario Puzo's bestselling novelThe Godfather--and built around it a stunning sequel to his Oscar-winning, 1972 hit film. Robert De Niro plays Vito as a young Sicilian immigrant in turn-of-the-century New York City's Little Italy. Coppola weaves in and out of the story of Vito's transformation into a powerful crime figure, contrasting that evolution against efforts by son Michael Corleone to spread the family's business into pre-Castro Cuba. As memorable as the first film is,The Godfather IIis an amazingly intricate, symmetrical tragedy that touches upon several chapters of 20th-century history and makes a strong case that our destinies are written long before we're born. This was De Niro's first introduction to a lot of filmgoers, and he makes an enormous impression. But even with him and a number of truly brilliant actors (including maestro Lee Strasberg), this is ultimately Pacino's film and a masterful performance.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000003KHS", "6302158176", "6300183211", "B0019L21H4", "6300214826", "6303686796", "6303168507", "0782008348", "6303471501", "0790705141", "0790733927", "6303402070", "B00003CXE6", "B000056BRF", "6300267997", "6300181340", "B0001VL30O", "6301977815", "6305363668", "0800132009", "6304508611", "B00005B238", "6300182878", "0792845684", "6302226899", "B00005Q4GZ", "0800100832", "6304429274", "B0000A36J1"], "bought_together": ["B000003KHS", "6302158176"], "also_viewed": ["B000NTPDSW", "B0019L770A", "B000003KHS", "6302158176", "6302610702", "6300183211", "0792174909", "B00EN09FKO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 228315}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.9, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "630021639X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41807N7YNFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Godfather, Part II [VHS]"}

{"description": "Black comedies don't come much blacker than this cult favorite from 1972, and they don't come much funnier, either. It seemed that director Hal Ashby was the perfect choice to mine a mother lode of eccentricity from the original script by Colin Higgins, about the unlikely romance between a death-obsessed 19-year-old named Harold (Bud Cort) and a life-loving 79-year-old widow named Maude (Ruth Gordon). They meet at a funeral, and Maude finds something oddly appealing about Harold, urging him to \"reach out\" and grab life by the lapels as opposed to dwelling morbidly on mortality. Harold grows fond of the old gal--she's a lot more fun than the girls his mother desperately matches him up with--and together they makeHarold & Maudeone of the sweetest and most unconventional love stories ever made. Much of the earlier humor arises from Harold's outrageous suicide fantasies, played out as a kind of twisted parlor game to mortify his mother, who's grown immune to her strange son's antics. Gradually, however, the film's clever humor shifts to a brighter outlook and finally arrives at a point where Harold is truly happy to be alive. Featuring soundtrack songs by Cat Stevens, this comedy certainly won't appeal to all tastes (it was a box-office flop when first released), but if you're on its quirky wavelength, it might just strike you as one of the funniest movies you've ever seen.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301590740", "B00000FZCU"], "bought_together": ["6301590740"], "also_viewed": ["6300247171"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 239875}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6300216268", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5184NCC63XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Harold &amp; Maude [VHS]"}
{"description": "AfterThe Exorcistsparked a lengthy trend of supernatural thrillers, this 1976 horror film scored a hit with critics and audiences for mixing gothic horror and mystery into its plot about a young boy suspected of being the personification of the anti-Christ. (No doubt it's a favorite of shock-rocker  Marilyn Manson.) Directed by Richard Donner (best known for hisSupermanandLethal Weaponfilms),The Omengained a lot of credibility from the casting of Gregory Peck and Lee Remick as a distinguished American couple living in England, whose young son Damien bears \"the mark of the beast.\" Mysterious deaths and unexplained incidents draw the attention of a photographer (David Warner), whose investigation leads to the young boy--and also to the photographer's shocking decapitation (in a scene that has since been inducted into the horror hall of fame). At a time when graphic gore had yet to dominate the horror genre, this film used its violence discreetly and to great effect, and the mood of dread and potential death is masterfully maintained. It's all a bit hokey, with a lot of biblical portent and sensational fury, but few would deny it's highly entertaining.

Lee faces down the towering Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in an impressive battle, one of the only surviving scenes from Lee's original shoot, while outtakes from his battle with Chuck Norris inReturn of the Dragonare used along with real-life footage from Lee's funeral. The rest of the film is a mishmash of car chases and clumsily edited fights, complete with awkward inserts of Lee's face. His double remains hidden behind a pair of dark glasses or a motorcycle helmet throughout, and he abruptly changes into a yellow jumpsuit for no reason other than to match Lee's costume in the final scene.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"bought_together": ["0790735172", "6300250164"], "also_viewed": ["6300250164", "B0015RCUQO", "6302469090", "0790735172"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 441683}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.21, "brand": "", "asin": "6300250172", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4128N3E835L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Game of Death [VHS]"}
{"description": "A funny thing happened toFinian's Rainbowin between its debut as a Broadway musical in 1947 and its appearance as a film in 1968. After 21 years, its theme of racial tension in the American South was no longer cutting edge, and the fact that its heroes are a group of sharecroppers called the Rainbow Valley Tobacco Cooperative dates it even further. Add a number of subplots and the heavy hand of a 29-year-old Francis Ford Coppola directing his first and only musical, and the two-and-a-half-hour running time feels bloated. Hermes Pan (best known for the classic Astaire-Rogers movies) is credited with choreographing the overbusy musical numbers, but he was reportedly overruled by Coppola at every turn. Still, there is a lot to enjoy in this movie, most notably Fred Astaire in his last lead role in a musical. Fred plays Finian McLonergan, an Irishman who has traveled to America in hopes of planting a pilfered pot of gold near Fort Knox and watching it grow. Even at 69, Fred shows he is still capable of a sprightly step and warbling \"Look to the Rainbow.\" Another plus is the casting of '60s pop icon Petula Clark as his daughter, as she sings with an unaffected loveliness. Finally, the score by Burton Lane and E.Y. Harburg includes two of the best Broadway songs ever written--\"Old Devil Moon\" and \"How Are Things in Glocca Morra?\"--as well as the comic ditty \"When I'm Not Near the Girl I Love.\"--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790744759"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 354524}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.01, "brand": "", "asin": "6300269558", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RQDDQFQ9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Finian's Rainbow [VHS]"}
{"description": "When Mac MacIntyre (played with deadpan perfection by Peter Riegert) is sent by his star-gazing, slightly insane Knox Oil and Gas boss (Burt Lancaster) to Scotland's West Coast to buy the rights to a seaside town slated to be the site of an oil refinery, Mac embarks on his journey reluctantly. \"Why do I have to go to all the way to Scotland?\" Mac complains to a coworker. \"I'm really more of a Telex man.\" But on the way to closing the deal, a funny thing happens: the place takes root in Mac. The town's eccentric inhabitants, eventful night sky, and stunning scenery soak into his psyche and combine to bring a very different Mac to the surface, a Mac who collects seashells, walks on the beach in his jeans instead of his suit, and throws his calendar watch, beeping \"meeting time in Houston,\" into the sea.Mac eventually vies to switch places with Gordon Urquhart--accountant, bartender, innkeeper, and community representative in the land deal. After an evening spent drinking 42-year-old scotch (\"old enough to be out on its own,\" Mac chirps, and then laughs smugly at his own joke) and negotiating the real estate deal, Mac tries to negotiate a deal for himself--to trade his high-rise Houston apartment, Porsche, and oil-company job for Urquhart's less traditional, but more fulfilling, life.The plot runs along almost as if behind the scenes, and the characters are intriguing, but the real appeal here is the incisive yet gentle humor. During a visit to a Knox Oil lab, Mac is shown into a room that contains a miniature of the town he has been sent to purchase. The head of the lab says, \"Welcome to our little world,\" and then gives Mac the plastic replica of the town as a souvenir. \"Dream large,\" he intones. The irony's easy to miss and is just one example of the intelligent presence--in the form of writer and director Bill Forsyth--working behind the scenes here.Mark Knopfler's delicate, haunting soundtrack complements the sometimes melancholy, sometimes hilarious currents ofLocal Heroto perfection.--Stefanie Durbin", "related": {"bought_together": ["B00000ILEC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 351312}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 23.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6300270009", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41W035SZKPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Local Hero [VHS]"}

Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick are the besotted couple who find that life is not always fun when viewed through ros&eacute;-colored glasses. He's the San Francisco business executive who marries Remick and seduces her into a cocktail culture that soon overpowers them both.

{"description": "Part mystery, part wartime polemic,Lifeboatfinds director Alfred Hitchcock tackling a cinematic challenge that foreshadows the self-imposed handicaps ofRopeandRear Window. As with those subsequent features, Hitchcock confines his action and characters to a single set, in this instance the lone surviving lifeboat from an Allied freighter sunk by a German U-boat in the North Atlantic. A less confident, ingenious filmmaker might have opened up John Steinbeck's dialogue-driven character study beyond the battered boat and its cargo of survivors, but Hitchcock instead revels in his predicament to exploit the enforced intimacy between his characters.Indeed, we never actually see the doomed freighter--the smoking ship's funnel beneath the credits simply sinks beneath the waves, and we're plunged into the escalating tensions between those who gradually find their way to the boat, a band of eight English and American passengers and crew, plus a German sailor (Walter Slezak) rescued from the U-boat, itself destroyed by the freighter's deck gun. Heading the cast and inevitably commanding their and our attention is the cello-voiced Tallulah Bankhead as Connie Porter, a cynical, sophisticated writer whose priorities seem to be hanging onto her mink and keeping her lipstick fresh. Gradually, the others find Porter and her lifeboat, forming a temporary community that inevitably suggests a careful cross section of archetypes, from wealthy industrialist (Henry Hull) to ship's boiler men (John Hodiak and William Bendix).Hitchcock juggles the interpersonal skirmishes between the boat's occupants with the mystery of their German prisoner, which itself becomes a meditation on the fine line between nationalism and morality, a line that Slezak walks delicately until his identity is resolved. Visually, Hitchcock transforms his back-lot set and its rear-projected cloudbanks into a desolate stretch of ocean, while capturing the horror of an amputation through an economical set of images culminating in an empty boot.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0045HCJ9E", "6302413435", "0783236352", "B002GSXKQA", "0790743159", "1558807780", "6301800974", "0783235623", "0769403468", "6301640667", "6301975987", "6301973232", "1558808590", "630150528X", "0800100832", "6301564456", "6302226899", "6301959728", "B000EVD38G", "B00004R67T", "6302909023", "B00005Q4GY", "6304457316", "0790743213", "6300246965", "6301798503", "6302360978", "0783221347", "6301797957", "6301973410", "6300183580", "6304196954", "6301798708", "B000056BRF", "6302842263", "6304359705", "0792108280", "079074886X"], "also_viewed": ["B001D8W7F4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 319371}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6301798732", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AC1NXHYzL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lifeboat (The Hitchcock Collection) [VHS]"}

{"description": "An alternate title for this movie could easily beRV to Hell.  Two middle-class couples take their spankin'-new motor home on a trip to  Colorado. While camping out in Texas, the men see something they shouldn't--a  human sacrifice by Satanists who somehow manage not to notice their Safeway- sized vehicle until the last minute. The tourists flee from the devil  worshippers, getting the monstrous RV hung up in a stream, and so goes the  rest of the movie. The local sheriff is in league with the devil, and every  town they come to is full of pesky Satanists. The vacationers are nothing if  not resourceful, though; when a pair of determined Beelzebubbers cling to the  vehicle like barnacles, Peter Fonda pokes at them with an aluminum  vacuum-cleaner wand until they give up and fall off! Oddly, halfway through the  film, it turns from a fairly routine (if suspenseful) horror movie to a Ron  Howard-style car-chase film, with a half-dozen vehicles pursuing the motor  home. The vacationers continue to abuse the RV until large chunks of it begin  to fall off, fending off their enemies with a shotgun until the nasty  surprise ending. With a cast that includes Fonda, Warren Oates, Loretta Swit,  and Lara Parker, it's hard to go wrong (though the women's roles consist of  screaming ineffectually, making coffee, and cleaning the earth-toned  Winnebago).

{"description": "Glenn Savan's depressing and self-loathing novel about a 27-year-old upper-class Jewish widower mired in self-pity after his beloved wife dies, and who finds love and sexual rebirth with a trailer-trash older woman, was brought to the big screen by the competent director Luis Mandoki (When a Man Loves a Woman,Message in a Bottle). But the savage irony in Savan's book has been face-lifted by screenwriters Ted Tally (The Silence of the Lambs) and Alvin Sargent (Ordinary People) into something else entirely: what passes for low-rent \"slumming\" in Hollywood means hiring sexy Susan Sarandon to play Nora Baker, the poor, uneducated 43-year-old waitress in a White Palace burger joint who strikes up an unlikely relationship with sad Max Baron (James Spader). Widower Max attends a bachelor party for best pal Neil (Jason Alexander) and discovers that the local White Palace has stiffed the boys a whopping six burgers. Max barges into the joint, bent on getting his money back, and meets a testy Nora, who is bemused at the young man's insolence. While driving home, Max stops abruptly at a bar for a drink. Inside, Nora is nursing a vodka and takes a shine to the tuxedo-clad, handsome, and morose younger man. He gives her a lift, she seduces him, and the rest of the movie examines how two such opposites in manners and morals can find happiness. The only common bond they have is great sex and a private tragedy.White Palacenudges at the dark journey and the smashing of illusion that was at the heart of the novel, but there is still a fairy-tale element to the film that negates the earthy essence that distinguished the book. In Mandoki's vision,White Palaceis about overcoming class, family, and outside opinion to find true love. In Savan's book, Max wastes into decline while Nora ultimately thrives in the quest for truth, redemption, and self-forgiveness. She becomes his salvation only after he stops hating himself. But mainstream Hollywood shuns making \"protagonists\" so mad, bad, or sad, and as such, too much glitter is tossed on Spader, while Sarandon, as usual, is the only one who seems to embody and understand her character's angst. She deserved her Oscar for Nora, not the nun inDead Man Walking.--Paula Nechak", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008DDSA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 348202}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6301945301", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31EG5WX3JAL.gif", "title": "White Palace [VHS]"}

While Burns is a historian, a researcher, and a documentarian, he's above all a gifted storyteller, and it's his narrative powers that give this chronicle its beauty, overwhelming emotion, and devastating horror. Using the words of old letters, eloquently read by a variety of celebrities, the stories of historians like Shelby Foote and rare, stained photos, Burns allows us not only to relearn and finally understand our history, but also to feel and experience it.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304209908", "6303218725", "B000R7NBMK", "B002BO2R4K", "630428957X", "0780618831", "B000BITUI4", "B003S1UNZU", "B0089VX0UO", "B004NJC0R0", "B00A2XTHYU", "B00003CXA6", "B004FGA2HQ", "B007VYEF04", "B009AMANBA", "B000050HEQ", "6303026109", "630272001X", "B00005N900", "0780620135", "6304383657"], "bought_together": ["6304209908"], "also_viewed": ["B000BITUFC", "B000R7NBMK", "6303218725", "6304209908", "0394749138", "B003S1UNZU", "B00JDCFQ6E", "0394562852", "B000ANVQ50", "0705425312", "B0002F6AH0", "0345348109", "B00003CXA6", "B0086IMN80", "6303026109", "B000T28PFQ", "B000BITUHU", "019516895X", "6303696627", "B000NTPDSW", "B00AQNOCZ0", "B00JAQJMJ0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 188197}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 85.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6301996135", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61MYX3J1YSL._SX300_.jpg", "title": "The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns (Boxed Set) [VHS]"}

{"description": "The \"lost\" sleeper hit of 1980 has since become one of the most revered cult movies of all time, largely due to its bawdy, irreverent story about the art and artifice of filmmaking and an outrageously clever performance by Peter O'Toole. As megalomaniacal film director Eli Cross, O'Toole plays a larger-than-life figure whose ability to manipulate reality is like a power-trip narcotic. The focus of his latest mind game is a fugitive (Steve Railsback) recruited to replace a stuntman killed during a recent on-set accident. In return for protective sanctuary, the fugitive takes a crash course in stunt work but soon discovers that he's the paranoid player in a game he can't control, with the dictatorial director making up the rules. Or is he?The Stunt Manis a game of its own, played through the fantasy of filmmaking, and half the fun of watching the movie comes from sharing the stuntman's paranoid confusion. Barbara Hershey has a smart, sexy supporting role as a lead actress who won't submit to her director's seemingly devious behavior; but it's clearly O'Toole who steals the show. Director Richard Rush adds to the movie's maverick appeal--in a career plagued by struggles against the mainstream studio system, Rush hasn't made a better movie before or since.The Stunt Manclearly represents the potential of his neglected talent.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0800116917", "6301016289", "6303562248"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 478717}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.97, "brand": "", "asin": "6302260973", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RB3Q3HJDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Stunt Man [VHS]"}

That's too bad, because this underrated  Joe Johnston film has a certain loopy charm. The story centers on a pre-World  War&nbsp;II stunt pilot (Bill Campbell) who accidentally comes into possession of a rocket-propelled backpack much coveted by the Nazis. With the aid of his mechanic pal (Alan Arkin), he gets it up and running, then uses it to foil a plot by a gang of vicious Nazi spies (is there any other kind?) led by Timothy Dalton.

An altogether enjoyable comedy, the film is full of small surprises, big laughs, and wonderful character turns. Catherine Ballou (Jane Fonda) is a schoolteacher until a hired thug kills her daddy. To protect what she loves, she collects two petty criminals, a wisecracking hired hand, and a hired killer, Kid Shelleen (Lee Marvin). Unfortunately, Shelleen is a raging drunk who is so inebriated and unsteady with a gun he literally misses the broad side of a barn. However, Cat, has, as they used to say in those days, a mind of her own, and she masterminds a spectacular train heist that puts them all on the lam. Marvin won an Academy Award for his role as the derelict Shelleen, and his performances (he actually has two) are still topnotch and on target.

{"description": "When a young Dutchman discovers that his girlfriend has gone missing during their return to Holland from a bicycling trip in France, he begins a three-year search that forms the basis of this unsettling psychological thriller from 1988, originally titledSpoorloos. The missing woman's whereabouts remain a mystery, but the film provides an early introduction to her abductor, a seemingly normal family man whose domestic tranquility hides a meticulous, methodical madness. As the despondent husband advertises all over France and Holland for his missing wife, this game of cat-and-mouse escalates into a strategy of psychological horror, revealing certain facts and merely suggesting others to create an intense atmosphere of dread and anticipation.

{"description": "This documentary of the Rolling Stones' 1969 US tour has become a legendary, harrowing symbol of the tragic demise of the \"Peace and Love\" era. After a successful tour across the United States, the Rolling Stones gave a free December concert at Altamont Speedway in California with the Grateful Dead (not seen performing), Ike and Tina Turner, Jefferson Airplane, and the Flying Burrito Brothers (all seen performing one song each). The poorly planned show was fraught with problems from its inception. The band unwisely selected the Hells Angels motorcycle club to provide security, and after the pre-existing chaos was fueled by very visible alcohol and drug abuse, the bikers resorted to violence to keep the stoned, restless, and often naked crowd in line. The result: dozens of injuries and the on-screen stabbing of a young African-American man (during \"Sympathy for the Devil,\" no less) by one of the concert's \"staff security.\" In a manipulative but effective move, the Maysles brothers and Charlotte Zwerin filmed Mick Jagger in the editing room witnessing the on-camera murder for the first time. But aside from that unexpected drama, the film also works as a rock-and-roll document, capturing the band at their most relaxed, intoxicating, and electrifying.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001NXDSLQ", "6301095294"]}, "price": 27.98, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Classic Rock", "Album-Oriented Rock (AOR)"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Metal"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock", "Blues Rock"], ["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 311795}, "asin": "6302415993", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21S9HY0GRFL.jpg", "title": "The Rolling Stones - Gimme Shelter [VHS]"}
{"description": "One of the spookiest ghost stories ever put to film,The Uninvitedis also one of the few classic haunted-house movies to treat the subject with respect and seriousness. Ray Milland and Ruth Hussey play a brother and sister who leave the city to live in a beautiful old house dramatically perched on a cliff overlooking the Cornish coast. As they discover some of the house's peculiarities--the unexplained chill that settles in certain rooms, the aroma of mimosas that wafts through the house, flowers that wilt when brought inside--they are told by local girl Gail Russell that the house is haunted, by the spirit of Russell's mother no less. The rationalist city folk first scoff at the idea but as Milland slowly falls in love with the frightened girl he investigates the legends and discovers some startling hidden truths. Donald Crisp costars as  Russell's humorless, hard-bitten grandfather who forbids her visits to the house. Handsomely shot against the beautiful Cornish countryside, director Lewis Allen wisely suggests more than he shows and the uneasy tone and quietly restrained direction looks forward to such films asThe HauntingandThe Legend of Hell House. Though Allen ultimately reveals a suitably spine-tingling apparition, some of the film's best moments are chilling in their simplicity: nocturnal moans, slamming doors, and the dog's whimpering fear of the upstairs.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005UMF5", "B0045HCJJE", "B0009X75EC", "0783116926", "B000063UR0", "B007XF0W3K", "6301708113", "6303985637", "B00005N5RQ", "B00027JYNK", "B0013D8LAE", "630197350X", "6305416222", "B008BSM1XC", "B000083C6R", "6300183912", "6300208133", "6303333079", "6300154939", "6303011403", "6302878535", "6303364772", "6301661826", "6304308418", "6301415159", "6301670140", "0783236352", "6302308585", "6302374227", "6301640667", "6302424909", "6300183084"], "bought_together": ["B0009X75EC"], "also_viewed": ["B00L3ZB27Q", "6301646088", "B000083C6R", "B0000694WH", "6305106959", "B00JAQJMJ0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 213246}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 30.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6302503493", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51S64WSVPFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Uninvited [VHS]"}

{"description": "City Lightsis a film to pick for the time capsule, a film that best represents the many aspects of director-writer-star Charlie Chaplin at the peak of his powers: Chaplin the actor, the sentimentalist, the knockabout clown, the ballet dancer, the athlete, the lover, the tragedian, the fool. It's all contained in Chaplin's simple story of a tramp who falls in love with a blind flower girl (Virginia Cherrill). Chaplin elevates the Victorian contrivances of the plot to something glorious with his inventive use of pantomime and his sure grasp of how the Tramp relates to the audience. In 1931, it was a gamble for Chaplin to stick with silence after talking pictures had killed off the art form that had made him famous, but audiences flocked toCity Lightsanyway. (Chaplin would not make his first full talking picture until 1940'sThe Great Dictator.) After all the superb comic sequences, the film culminates with one of the most moving scenes in the history of cinema, a luminous and heartbreaking fade-out that lifts the picture onto another plane. (Woody Allen paid homage to the scene at the end ofManhattan.)

{"description": "This silky smooth film noir pits gruff police detective Dana Andrews, stiff and blunt in his street-bred manners, against a cultured columnist and acidic wit (Clifton Webb at his prissiest) in a battle of wits during a murder investigation. The cop is a romantic hiding under a hard-boiled exterior who falls in love with the beautiful victim through the portrait that hangs in her apartment. Gene Tierney, whose heart-shaped face mixes the exotic with the girl next door, brings the poise and calm of a model to her role as the object of every man's gaze and the target of a killer.Laura, handsomely shot in dreamy black and white, is the first and best of Otto Preminger's cool, controlled murder mysteries. In the gritty world of film noir it remains the most refined and elegant example of the genre, but under the tasteful decor and high-society fashions lies a world seething in jealousy, passion, blackmail, and murder.

{"description": "Like moths to a flame, great actors gravitate to the singular genius of playwright-screenwriter David Mamet, who updated his Pulitzer Prize-winning play for this all-star screen adaptation. The material is not inherently cinematic, so the movie's greatest asset is Mamet's peerless dialogue and the assembly of a once-in-a-lifetime cast led by Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, and Alec Baldwin (the last in a role Mamet created especially for the film). Often regarded as a critique of the Reagan administration's impact on the American economy, the play and film focus on a competitive group of real estate salesmen who've gone from feast to famine in a market gone cold. When an executive \"motivator\" (Alec Baldwin) demands a sales contest among the agents in the cramped office, the stakes are critically high: any agent who fails to meet his quota of sales \"leads\" (i.e., potential buyers) will lose his job. This intense ultimatum is a boon for the office superstar (Pacino), but a once-successful salesman (Lemmon) now finds himself clinging nervously to faded glory. Political and personal rivalries erupt under pressure when the other agents (Alan Arkin, Ed Harris) suspect the office manager (Kevin Spacey) of foul play. This cauldron of anxiety, tension, and sheer desperation provides fertile soil for Mamet's scathingly rich dialogue, which is like rocket fuel for some of the greatest actors of our time. Pacino won an Oscar nomination for his volatile performance, but it's Lemmon who's the standout, doing some of the best work of his distinguished career. Director James Foley shapes Mamet's play into a stylish, intensely focused film that will stand for decades as a testament to its brilliant writer and cast.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303515223", "1558807780"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 369412}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.3, "brand": "", "asin": "6302732875", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51S2V1ZW1GL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Glengarry Glen Ross [VHS]"}
{"description": "Just asDo the Right Thingwas the capstone of Spike Lee's earlier career,Malcolm Xmarked the next milestone in the filmmaker's artistic maturity. It seemed everything Lee had done up to that point was to prepare him for this epic biography of America's fiery civil-rights leader, who is superbly played by Oscar-nominated Denzel Washington, from his early days as a zoot-suited hustler known as \"Detroit Red\" to his spiritual maturity after his pilgrimage to Mecca, as a Black Muslim by the name of El Hajj Malik El Shabazz.Do the Right Thingclimaxed with the photographic images of Malcolm X and Dr. Martin Luther King engulfed by flames of rage;Malcolm Xexplores the genesis and evolution of that rage over Malcolm's lifetime, and how these two great figures--held up to the public as polar-opposites within the African American human rights movement (King for nonviolent civil disobedience, Malcolm for achieving equality \"by any means necessary\")--were each essential to the agenda of the other. Lee careens from the hedonistic ebullience of Malcolm's early days to the stark despair of prison, from his life-changing conversion to Islam to his emergence as a dynamic political leader--all with an epic sweep and vitality that illuminates personal details as well as political ideology. Angela Bassett is also terrific as Malcolm's wife, Betty Shabazz.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300270971", "6300269159", "6303953425", "6300215830", "6303168507", "B0000065S0", "6300268861"], "bought_together": ["6300270971"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 356174}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.85, "brand": "", "asin": "6302787556", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31E06Q2Y8NL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Malcolm X [VHS]"}

{"description": "This love story made in 1955 and set against the backdrop of war is a many-splendored thing: it features a drop-dead gorgeous Eurasian doctor seeking meaning in her life (Jennifer Jones), a dashing but married American war correspondent who's macho yet not afraid to declare his love (William Holden), and a couple of murky subplots to give their relationship its oh-what's-going-to-happen-next edge (her Chinese heritage, his wife, the outbreak of the Korean War). One scene builds beautifully upon the next, accompanied by dialogue that often sounds like poetry: \"I will make no mistakes in the name of loneliness,\" the doctor says near the beginning of their relationship.

Unfortunately, the lady happens to be the target of her mobster ex-husband (Michael Parks), who has a tight grip on New York's garment district. Disfigured and finally murdered by her former spouse, Olivia is avenged in very creative ways by Paul, who resorts to such esoterica as using a remote-controlled soccer ball to deliver an explosive punishment. Bronson largely phones it in for this potboiler, though even in the winter of his life he can look quite compelling in his stoic way.

{"description": "This 1970 Billy Wilder comedy-drama about a major defeat in the career of Sherlock Holmes may have little to do with the legacy of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, but in its uncut form it happens to be one of the finest films of the decade. Robert Stephens makes a perfectly splendid Holmes, brilliant, sophisticated, and deeply flawed, while Colin Blakely plays Dr. Watson as a drinker and ladies' man with more personality and intelligence than is often granted him by filmmakers. The case (which has some echoes of Doyle's story \"The Bruce-Partington Plans\") begins with Holmes aiding the distressed Madame Valladon (Genevi&egrave;ve Page), who is searching for her missing husband. The inquiry shifts to Scotland, and despite a stern warning from the hero's brother, Mycroft Holmes (Christopher Lee), Sherlock pursues events that reveal a top-secret government plan. Lush, energetic, funny, gorgeous to look at, and ultimately tragic, the film is layered with Wilder's familiar collision of cynicism and yearning, hope and betrayal, grace and isolation.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302989590"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 450050}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.55, "brand": "", "asin": "6303091989", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514P4M6PP7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Private Life of Sherlock Holmes [VHS]"}

{"description": "Edward D. Wood Jr. was an actor writer-director-producer, occasionally in drag, who combined meager bursts of talent with an undying optimism to create some of the most bizarrely memorable \"B\" movies to ever come out of Tinseltown. Though Wood died in obscurity as an alcoholic in 1978, his films have been considered cult classics for years. He is consistently voted the worst director who ever lived. You would think this an odd subject, but director Tim Burton harnesses the undying hopefulness that made Wood such a character. Shot in black and white, just like Wood's creations, this stylized, witty production captures the poetic absurdity of Wood's films and his unconventional life. Burton's recreation of Wood's wonderfully awfulPlan 9 from Outer Spacelooks much better than the original low-budget quickie. Burton tackled an extremely strange subject matter for a biopic, but Wood is presented as naive almost to the point of delusion, so the story works. The pace sags in the middle, as the weirdness starts to wear thin, but Depp proves himself an adroit actor, even while wearing angora and a blonde wig. Wood's unconventional repertoire company is faithfully reproduced, including an Academy Award-winning Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi. Landau is pathetic, droll, and charismatic as the elderly junkie who made his last screen appearances in Wood's films.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301763041", "0800187873"], "bought_together": ["6301763041"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 314635}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.87, "brand": "", "asin": "6303407188", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F97RJE9XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ed Wood [VHS]"}

{"description": "David Lean focused all his talent as an epic-maker on Boris Pasternak's sweeping novel about a doctor-poet in revolutionary Russia. The results may sometimes veer toward soap opera, especially with the screen frequently filled with adoring close-ups of Omar Sharif and Julie Christie, but Lean's gift for cramming the screen with spectacle is not to be denied. The streets of Moscow, the snowy steppes of Russia, the house in the country taken over by ice; these are re-created with Lean's unerring sense of grandness. The movie is so lush and so long that it becomes an irresistible wallow, even when logic suffers--likeGone with the Windbefore it andTitanicafter. Sharif, who achieved stardom in Lean's previous film,Lawrence of Arabia, mostly looks noble, but the supporting cast is spiky: Rod Steiger as a fat-cat monster, Tom Courtenay as a self-righteous revolutionary, and Klaus Kinski and Alec Guinness in smaller roles.

A U.S. bomber is accidentally ordered toward Moscow, ready to drop its load. The U.S. president (Henry Fonda) and various military and congressional leaders must then scramble to deal with the disaster. The built-in suspense is well maintained by director Sidney Lumet, working from a script by former blacklisted writer Walter Bernstein. The solemn, serious approach doesn't begin to touch the brilliance ofStrangelove's inspired take on the nuclear nightmare, butFail Safeis absorbing and well acted (a memorable role for Walter Matthau, for instance). The movie enters unexpected territory in its final minutes; conditioned for feel-good endings, viewers are still genuinely shocked by the plot turns in the final reels. The climax comes as a sobering slap in the face, intriguingly staged by Lumet.

{"description": "The definitive screen adaptation of Henry James'sThe Turn of the Screw, the 1961 production ofThe Innocentsremains one of the most effective ghost stories ever filmed. Originally promoted as the first truly \"adult\" chiller of the big screen (a marginally valid claim considering the release ofPsychoa year earlier), the film arrived at a time when the thematic depth of James's story could finally be addressed without the compromise of reductive discretion. And while the Freudian anxiety that fuels the story may seem tame by today's standards, the psychological horrors that comprise the story's \"dark secret\" are given full expression in a film that brilliantly clouds the boundary between tragic reality and frightful imagination.In one of her finest performances, Deborah Kerr stars as Miss Giddons, a devout and somewhat repressed spinster who happily accepts the position of governess for two orphaned children whose uncle (Michael Redgrave) readily admits to having no interest in being tied down by two \"brats.\" So Miss Giddons is dispatched to Bly House, the lavish, shadowy estate where young Flora (Pamela Franklin) and her brother Miles (Martin Stephens, so memorable in 1960'sVillage of the Damned) live with a good-natured housekeeper (Megs Jenkins). At first, life at Bly House seems splendidly idyllic, but as Miss Giddons learns the horrible truth about the estate's now-deceased groundskeeper and previous governess, she begins to suspect that her young charges are ensnared in a devious plot from beyond the grave.Ghostly images are revealed in only the most fleeting glimpses, and the outstanding Cinemascope photography by Freddie Francis (who used special filters to subtly darken the edges of the screen) turns Bly House into a welcoming mansion by day, a maze of mystery and terror by night. Sound effects and music are used to bone-chilling effect, and director Jack Clayton, blessed with a script by William Archibald and Truman Capote, maintains a deliberate pace to emphasize the ambiguity of James's timeless novella. The result is a masterful film--comparable to the 1963 classicThe Haunting--that uses subtlety and suggestion to reach the pinnacle of fear.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302180015", "B0009A2PQI", "6301797957"], "also_viewed": ["B000060MVG"]}, "price": 33.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 383381}, "asin": "6303957064", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51778QWGJKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Innocents [VHS]"}

{"description": "Some people may sneer at this 1965 musical, but the truth is the film has earned its status as a perennially watchable romantic-drama, largely on the strength of a fun story and chemistry between stars Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer. Veteran filmmaker Robert Wise (The Day the Earth Stood Still) mostly stays out of the way of the film's appealing elements, which include a based-on-fact tale of Austria's von Trapp family, who fled their Nazi-occupied country in 1938. Andrews is delightful and even fascinating as Maria, who sheds her tomboyish ways as a novice nun to accept the mantle of adulthood, becoming matron of the motherless von Trapp clan. Plummer is matinee-idol handsome and gives a smart performance to boot, and the cast of young people and kids who make up the singing von Trapp children make a strong impression. Based on the Rodgers and Hammerstein stage musical, the score includes such winners as \"Maria\" and the future John Coltrane hit \"My Favorite Things.\"--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304400551", "6304178352", "6305123616", "B00000JS61", "6305282927", "B00000F6D1", "630233683X", "6304151306", "6302526574", "6303494390", "0792839846", "0792839129", "155890641X", "6303215734", "0788802194", "0788812807", "6301390725", "6303314015", "0788812408", "630150528X", "0790744759", "6303444202", "6300263673", "6302787068", "6304401132", "6302320402", "0788805533", "B00004TRD5", "6300246787", "6303854311", "B000056BRF", "0788805843", "0792151712", "B0041GWWUK", "6304500831", "6302091632", "6303168507", "630197736X", "6301586026", "6300207919", "6302642248", "6300215695", "0788806270", "B00005LL26", "B0000048YM", "6304089767", "5559477621", "6300275310", "6305229449", "6302178924", "6300277089", "6305750750", "6304331851", "6302936381", "B00000JKNP", "6300181111", "B0000AQZYM", "6300215814", "6300215830", "6300274195", "B002M2Z3BA", "6300213668", "B000035Z2S", "0788803743", "B00000491O", "B00000I1EM", "B00005RRG3", "B002HK9IDQ", "6301796535", "6305940932", "0783222955", "6303315305", "6302271991", "6301966317", "B00004RV8M", "0792840836", "6304100507", "6301972279", "0792837614", "6304546262", "B00005RRG5", "6303929338", "6302150620", "6300182304", "6305326940", "078881172X", "B0000E32WB", "6302816246", "6300215741", "6301792734", "B0000633ZP", "0800132009", "B00005RRG6", "B0002F6BQU", "B000059HH1", "6305177473", "B0000VCZKM", "6301971531", "0792839749"], "bought_together": ["6304400551"], "also_viewed": ["6304400551", "6304178352", "6303314015", "6305123616", "155890641X", "0788812408", "B00000JS61", "0788802194", "6302526574", "6302642248", "0792839129", "6305282927", "B00000F6D1", "078881172X", "6304500831", "6300274268", "6302158095", "6303215734", "B000035Z2S", "6304151306", "6304143184", "0792151712", "0788805843", "6304401132", "6302787068", "6300213668", "0788806270", "6301969707", "630233683X", "6305326940", "0792839846", "6305750750", "B00005LL26", "6302178924", "6304978286", "5559477621", "6303036813", "6303494390", "B00000JKNP", "6304539258", "6304873441", "6301792769", "6304290888", "6304718551", "B0041GWWUK", "B000003KHS", "6304089767", "6303929338", "6302091632", "6302961572", "B0007KTBIU", "6300263673", "6303675212", "6301752627", "6301792734", "B00FWMVVLS", "0783229011", "6304539274", "B00004TRD5"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 84952}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.94, "brand": "", "asin": "6304117752", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AESVTB4DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Sound of Music [VHS]"}
{"description": "Of the many film versions of Victor Hugo's novel, this classic from Hollywood's golden year of 1939 remains the best, rivaled only by the 1923 silent version starring Lon Chaney. In his triumphant attempt to create a performance as memorable as Chaney's, Charles Laughton played the lovelorn Parisian hunchback Quasimodo under a disfiguring costume and gruesome makeup that rendered the actor almost unrecognizable. The result is a gripping and heartfelt portrayal of the misshapen bell ringer who falls desperately in love with the beautiful gypsy Esmeralda (played by Maureen O'Hara). The lavish production also greatly benefits from exquisitely moody black-and-white cinematography, brilliant medieval set design, and the atmospheric direction by German expatriate William Dieterle, whose style was heavily influenced by German films of the era.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001GH3CLA", "6301797906", "0792107683", "630182671X", "6301978536", "6303269915", "6301967410", "6301964268", "6300183513", "630197624X", "1558807780", "0792841026", "6304457316", "0790743159", "6302032237", "6304359721", "6305123616", "6302801133"], "also_viewed": ["6304290888", "B0000524CZ", "0788811002", "6302320402", "6300275310", "6302178924", "6304383851", "B001GH3CLA"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 330166}, "asin": "6304119038", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514NBTGM46L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Hunchback of Notre Dame [VHS]"}

But make no mistake: director Matthew Bright isn't out to feed anyone's sickest impulse.

{"description": "A deft balance between special effects, comedy, and family dynamics made this 1989 film a hit for Disney and spawned both a string of video sequels and a subsequent TV series. Moranis is endearing as the bumbling inventor/father of the Szalinski family. He inadvertently shrinks his own children then throws them out with the trash.

{"description": "Dashing Errol Flynn is the definitive Robin Hood in the most gloriously swashbuckling version of the legendary story. Warner Brothers reunited Michael Curtiz, their top-action director, with the winning team of Flynn and Olivia de Havilland (Maid Marian) and perennial villain Basil Rathbone as the aristocratic Sir Guy of Gisbourne, and pulled out all stops for the production. It became their costliest film to date, a grandly handsome, glowing Technicolor adventure set to a stirring,Oscar-winning scoreby Erich Wolfgang Korngold. The decadent Prince John (a smoothly conniving Claude Rains) takes advantage of King Richard's absence to tax the country into poverty but meets his match in the medieval guerrilla rebel Robin Hood and his Merry Men of Sherwood Forest, who rise up and, to quote a clich&eacute; coined by the film, \"steal from the rich and give to the poor.\" Stocky Alan Hale Sr. plays Robin's loyal friend Little John (a part he played in Douglas Fairbanks's silent version), Eugene Palette the portly Friar Tuck, and Melville Cooper the bumbling Sheriff of Nottingham. Flynn's confidence and cocky charm makes for a perfect Robin Hood, and his easygoing manner is a marvelous counterpoint to Rathbone's regal bearing and courtly diction. The film climaxes in their rousing battle-to-the-finish sword fight, a magnificently choreographed scene highlighted by Curtiz's inventive use of shadows cast upon the castle walls.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302120527", "6301976932", "6301977181", "6301977149", "6303212263", "6305123616", "B00004RFHL", "6301574117", "0790743159", "6300214060", "B00005A1VH", "6304178352", "0792839846", "630233683X", "6301977173", "6302961688", "630150528X", "6304935811", "B00005RRG6", "B00000JKNP", "6301973305", "6301670140", "1558800034", "0792107683", "B00004RGUU", "0782008348"], "bought_together": ["6301977149"], "also_viewed": ["B00005PJ8I"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 538065}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6304546386", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RMAFMQ02L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Adventures of Robin Hood [VHS]"}

Val Kilmer plays Simon Templar, the mercenary spy, who is hired to steal a fusion formula but falls in love with the scientist (Elisabeth Shue) who cooked it up.

Director Kurt Neumann, best known for the originalThe Fly, gives this low-budget sci-fi thriller an impressive scope, sending the striking, austerely designed giant robot (a walking battery with piledriver legs) marching across a B&W; widescreen frame like a relentless tank and punctuating the drama with an impressively chilling A-bomb blast.

{"description": "In the wake of the 45-million-dollar gross of the original Airport (1970), Universal was all but required by an act of Congress to produce Airport '75.  Of all the Airport films, this is the best example of \"famous folks in peril\" that helped define the disaster era of the 1970s.  Charlton Heston heads the all-star cast as Alan Murdock, the former test pilot who must keep a disabled 747 from crashing in flames. The crisis begins when a businessman (Dana Andrews), flying his small private plane, suffers a fatal heart attack and the plane smashes into the cockpit of the 747. Following Murdock's radioed instructions, stewardess Nancy Pryor (Karen Black) takes over the controls. The special-guest passenger lineup includes Helen Reddy as a singing nun (a character wickedly satirized in the 1980 parody Airplane!), Myrna Loy as an alcoholic, and Sid Caesar as a garrulous passenger. While Airport '75 yielded only 25 million dollars at the box office, the franchise continued, spawning Airport '77 a few years later and Airport '79 two years after that. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0087ZG7Q6", "6305137161", "B000EHSVOG", "B000ETRA5U", "B00BWJQEFI", "B000EHSVNW", "B00AFEYS9A", "B0087ZG7LG", "B00008AOTN", "B00083FZFE", "0783229372", "B00AEFY6DI", "B000063US2", "B000O599YY", "B000OHZJO6", "B00008438U", "B0001FGC1U", "B001EKP5D2", "B0029KDDIK", "B000O599NA", "B00108FMFO", "B001NSLE4Y", "B0002MHE1O", "B00AMQGB6O", "B0008ENIAC", "B00K6J7Q1Q", "B000HWZ4D4", "B000P0J0BU", "B000EXDSCA", "B004L9GMBC", "B0000549B1", "B00ENP2QZA", "B00AEFXDO6", "B000BZISTY", "B000063JDF", "B001PCNZHM", "B0000648ZW", "B00000K3TX", "B00C3ALLFS", "B00AEBB8VK", "B0006J28LY", "6305999872", "0783229364", "B0000648ZR", "B0009WFF68", "B000A2WJBQ", "B00441GYOM", "B00AEBB94G", "B00DJYKGKS", "B0001NBMH6", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B00009AVA5", "B000O599Y4", "B00AEFY7NM", "B000WMFZMY", "B00AEBB97S", "B006TTC5WC", "B000053VB2", "B001BGS17Q", "0783225547", "B00000331T", "B00004XPPC", "B0045HCJSA", "B0000DJZ8R", "B0010YVCI4", "B00AEFXVOI", "B00005A8XX", "B001AQO3SS", "B001D8W7EK", "B003AWRMBA", "B001D8W7EU", "B00005JKFR", "B004GJYR7I", "B0007939NO", "B00AEFXDGE", "B000083C6R"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AFEYS9A", "B0087ZG7Q6", "B000EHSVOG", "B000EHSVNW"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 95275}, "asin": "6304843267", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KK3P8T9DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Airport 75"}

{"description": "Annette Bening twists like a mink on a leash through Stephen Frears's adaptation of Jim Thompson's novel. This may be the perfect trope for the moral hysteria that coils around a mother, her son, and his girlfriend in this slender but highly pleasurable neo-noir. Small in effect and local in scope, the film is about small-fry, attractive, bloodless con artists who view the world as neatly split between ropers and suckers, grifters and squares. \"Grifter's got an irresistible urge to beat a guy that's wise,\" an old-timer tells Roy (John Cusack). And yet the three characters here--played by Angelica Huston, Cusack, and Bening--only beat the innocent: Lilly (Huston) gigs at the track for a mobster named Bobo, putting wads of cash on long-shot horses to even out the odds. Roy, her son, swindles citizens by dimes and degrees, flashing twenties at bars then paying for his beer with tens. His girlfriend, Myra (Bening), is hustling herself, her salad days as a long-con roper behind her. Theirs is a world of gut punches and smart lines, and the adrenaline these cheats and chiselers live by is palpable onscreen. But a larger canvas? Maybe it's there as a parallel universe. \"What do you sell again?\" Myra asks Roy, the matchbook salesman. \"Self-confidence,\" he says, a wry allusion to the confidence game all three of them are playing.

{"description": "Some pundits called it a flawed, exploitative action film that glamorized drug dealing and the luxury of a lucrative criminal lifestyle, spawning a trend of films that attracted youth gangs and provoked violence in theaters. Others hailed it as a breakthrough movie that depicted drug dealers as ruthless, corrupt, and evil, leading dead-end lives that no rational youth would want to emulate. However you interpret it,New Jack Cityis still one of the first and best films of the 1990s to crack open the underworld of cocaine and peer inside with its eyes wide open.  It's also the film that established Wesley Snipes as an actor to watch, with enough charisma to bring an insidious quality of seduction to his role as coke-lord Nino Brown, and enough intelligence to portray a character deluded by his own sense of indestructible power. Director Mario Van Peebles stretched his otherwise-limited talent to bring vivid authenticity and urgency to this crime story, and subplots involving a pair of tenacious cops (Ice-T, Judd Nelson) and a recovering coke addict (Chris Rock) provide additional dramatic tension. Although some critics may hesitate to admit it,New Jack Citydeserves mention in any serious discussion about African American filmmakers and influential films.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFYE08", "1558908390", "B002CA68N4", "B00000JGHV", "B00007AJG1", "B004SIP93S", "B002CA68NO", "6305505780", "B0000YEE6M", "B00005JLG1", "0767811070", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00AEFY6TW", "B0000JBUHI", "B00003CY51", "B000BOH8X2", "B000BITV9W", "B00003W8NT", "B000JRYOPG", "B00005U156", "0792838076", "B00066FAQW", "6305428409", "0780627822", "0767821955", "B0006H32DO", "0783230524", "B00007ELEO", "B00005JL72", "B000051YMS", "B002GSXKOM", "0783237367", "6304821832", "0783230389", "B000TLOMPE", "B00008977B", "B000060MWA", "B00005JD5J", "B00004Y2R1", "B000035P5I", "B0001FGBUW", "B0000TWMTS", "B00465I1CE", "B002CPMB9O", "B00005B8UA", "B00AEBB9AA", "B00005N89M", "B000A2XAQ4", "B0000714BU", "B00005JD5H", "B003NH6FY2", "B000C20VRS", "B000HDZKLO", "B0000AC8LH", "B001DJLD12", "B00005ASOO", "B00066FAVW", "0780627857", "B000P0J092", "0780631234", "630514415X", "B004P7CMZ0", "6305505802", "6305120013", "B002VWNIEA", "B0000696I2", "B000053VBC", "B003BV8I3Q", "B00E1HIXA2", "B0024EWP6W", "B0009S4IGA", "B0009K7RMA", "B00000JGHO", "B003VA3JZY", "B006VRRGQW", "B000FS9ULC", "B00003CXWV", "0767813901", "B000E40QC4", "B00008MTYF", "B00066FAC6", "B00004RJ71", "B002FOFX9M", "B00BTYRB2G", "B000JJSL1W", "0783240201", "B00007BK2Q", "155890834X", "B002VWNICM", "B001K98MGE", "B002CWKU36", "B000069DOB", "B000P0J0CE", "B00021R7E4", "B000JLTRH2", "B00AMSM9AO", "B0000714BS", "B001KKU9DM", "B00006HAYO", "B00DW5IL2E"], "bought_together": ["1558908390", "B00AEFYE08"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000YEE6M", "6305505780", "1558908390", "B000BITV9W"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 170777}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.0, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "6305047480", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H52SBMMYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "New Jack City"}
{"description": "Basil Fawlty, as created and performed by John Cleese, is the rudest, most boorish, most hilariously obnoxious man on the face of the planet. What a natural for a TV sitcom! His screen wife, Sybil (Prunella Scales), put it best in the episode \"The Psychiatrist\": \"You're either crawling all over them, licking their boots, or spitting poison at them like some Benzedrine puff adder.\" He mockingly replies, \"Just trying to enjoy myself, dear.\" With his gangly frame and contortionist abilities, Cleese brilliantly punctuates Basil's outrageous faux pas with absurd gymnastics and turns Three Stooges-style pokes and kicks into a slapstick ballet. Scales's Sybil is the genial but obliviously chatty voice of reason and Andrew Sachs mangles the English language as the Spanish bellhop Manuel, whose struggles with simple directions results in comic lunacy reminiscent of Robert Benigni. After a six-episode run in 1975, Cleese and cowriter and costar Connie Booth (who plays Polly, the maid all too often pulled into Basil's ridiculous plans) reunited the cast in 1979 for another six episodes without missing a punch line. The four-volume collection contains all 12 shows, interspersed with interview segments featuring Cleese discussing the genesis of the series and anecdotes about the individual episodes. Remember to watch the opening credits of each show to spot the creative misspellings on the hotel sign (my favorite: \"Fatty Owls\").--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303631991", "6302293553", "B00004TJRU", "6304626495", "B000035P9O"], "bought_together": ["6303631991"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 434629}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 21.97, "brand": "", "asin": "6305076464", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5153HAF049L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fawlty Towers - The Complete Collection [VHS]"}

{"description": "Brian De Palma's 1998 thriller is largely an exercise in airing out his orchestral, oversized visual style (think of hisBlowout,Body Double, orRaising Cain) for the heck of it. The far-fetched story features Nicolas Cage as a crooked police detective attending a championship boxing match at which the Secretary of Defense is assassinated. The unfortunate Secretary's right-hand man (Gary Sinise) happens to be Cage's old friend, a fact that complicates the cop's efforts to reconstruct the crime from conflicting accounts--a directorial strategy bearing similarities to Kurosawa'sRashomon. The outrageousness of the scenario essentially gives De Palma permission to construct a baroque cathedral of spectacular camera stunts, which (he well knows) are inevitably more interesting than the hoary conspiracy plot. (The opening scene alone, which runs on for a number of minutes and consists of one, unbroken shot that moves in from the street, following Cage up and down stairs, and in and out of rooms until finally ending ringside at the match, is breathtaking.) The shifting points of view--based on the contradictory statements of witnesses--also give De Palma license to get creative with camera angles and scene rearrangements.  The script bogs down in the third act, but De Palma is just revving up for a big, operatic finish that is absolutely gratuitous but undeniably impressive.

{"description": "Jackie Chan resurrects the oldCorsican Brotherschestnut of identical twin brothers separated at birth who meet up as adults and discover that they share more than blood ties. Poor boy Chan is a mechanic and race-car driver whose black-market activities have made him the target of some nasty mobsters, while jet-setting Chan is a world-famous conductor back in Hong Kong for a concert. In the same vicinity for the first time in years, they can suddenly feel each other's pain, and more. As one Chan jumps a jet boat for a wild escape, the other becomes a spastic victim of the furious ride, thrown around a posh restaurant while drenching his date with drinking water. Though the American cut has been pared of the worst of Chan's incessant mugging (it's about 12 minutes shorter than the original version), it's still overloaded with silly slapstick and cartoonish mistaken-identity gags as the boys swap girlfriends and dance. But wade through the crude comedy and you're rewarded with a gymnastic free-for-all climax in a car-testing workshop, where Chan leaps over, under, and through cars while taking on an army of gangsters before split-screen brothers team up for a bit of marionette martial arts.

{"description": "Roger Corman produced this shamelessJawsrip-off at the  height of the \"nature gone wild\" boom of American cinema and struck B-movie gold. Scripted by John Sayles and directed by Joe Dante, this  tongue-in-cheek thriller stars Bradford Dillman (doing his best Rip Torn  impression) as an antisocial mountain man and Heather Menzies as a rookie  detective who race a school of mutant piranha downriver. Dante and Sayles  provide the requisite blood and gore for this drive-in meat market: a kids' summer camp and a waterfront amusement park await the little beasties.  Along the way, riverside retiree Keenan Wynn gets his ankles stripped clean, camp counselor Paul Bartel is chomped on the cheek by a hungry little  bugger who takes to the air, and hordes of unlucky bathers are caught in  the center of a feeding frenzy. What differentiates this little gem from  the legion of similar knockoffs are the satirical swipes at military  arrogance and crass commercialism, Dante's energetic enthusiasm, and the  bursts of black humor: \"Lost River Lake: Terror, horror, death. Film at  11.\" The culty cast also includesInvasion of the Body Snatchers's  Kevin McCarthy as the hysterical scientist guarding the creatures, horror  diva Barbara Steele as a devious government researcher, and longtime Corman regular Dick Miller as an unscrupulous entrepreneur (\"Sir, the piranha are  eating the guests\").The DVD features good-humored commentary by director Joe Dante and producer Jon Davison, who also narrate the 10 minutes of good-quality home-movie  footage shot by Davison.

{"description": "Sean Connery plays a master thief thought to be long retired, while Catherine Zeta-Jones is his foil, a hotshot insurance investigator assigned to his case. They both have a little something to hold over each other's heads, until it turns out that Zeta-Jones is a professional art thief herself and is playing on both sides of the fence. At first they eye each other with mutual distrust until they team up for a job, which goes off without a hitch. Inevitably their prickly relationship begins to thaw somewhat, and the two become attracted to each other as they plan out the massive Y2K bank scam that is the movie's climax (complete with sequel-ready ending).Entrapmentplays somewhat like a '70s caper movie revamped for the gadget-happy high-tech '90s. The plot takes a few too many labored twists and turns, and the chemistry between the two leads is nearly nonexistent, though both carry on gamely in their parts. On the other hand, there is some genuine suspense in many scenes as they go about their business, dripping with whiz-bang burglary devices. Zeta-Jones, of course, is drop-dead gorgeous, and Connery is as reliable as always in his role. The fairly flat editing and direction tends to drag the film down somewhat, but fans of caper movies, high-tech thrillers, and the two leads should find plenty to like in this film.--Jerry Renshaw", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006IUNT", "6304925131", "079212569X", "0792133153", "0792116887", "B0000048TX", "6303696813", "0790731975", "6303313345", "6304258984", "0783223218", "0800125762", "B00004WIDB", "B00000IO4G", "0783216084", "6303020089", "0790748169", "6300183211"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 212089}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6305622825", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/7179VDAPNGL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Entrapment [VHS]"}

{"description": "A live concert at Carnegie Hall filmed in September 1998,My Favorite Broadway: The Leading Ladiesgathers a glittering lineup of Broadway's best, past and present. Some marquee names such as Bernadette Peters, Patti LuPone, and Betty Buckley are conspicuously missing, and Julie Andrews hosts but does not sing, but it still has Liza and stars aplenty from the '90s (Bebe Neuwirth, Faith Prince) as well as the '70s and '80s (Elaine Stritch, Jennifer Holliday, Nell Carter). The older stars sing songs from landmark original roles, while the '90s stars tend to sing either songs they've performed in revivals or songs from older shows--curiously, modern headliners such as Audra McDonald and Linda Eder sing older material rather than the contemporary shows (Ragtime,Jekyll & Hyde, respectively, among others) with which they are strongly associated.A number of these performances might be slightly inferior to those on the original recordings, but there are a number of gems, and the star power of the whole lineup is undeniable. In addition, even though only a few numbers provide action to watch, video is a valuable format for this concert because it gives faces to stars who most viewers outside of New York might recognize only by name or still photographs, and also allows fans to catch up with yesterday's stars. (Those who were dazzled by Andrea McArdle's cameo in the 1999 TV remake of her original star-making vehicle,Annie, will love her sweet, understated performance here.) Furthermore, the 99-minute video program provides more footage than the PBS telecast (85 minutes) or the CD release (61 minutes). This is highly recommended for Broadway fans.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000059H81", "B0000BZNDK", "B00005NGAE", "B000JGWD32", "B00002EIU6", "B000649YA2", "B00KO76FSA", "B00404ME0G", "B000ARXFBE", "B0007WFXZI", "B0000029PM", "B000BITUNE", "B0002TSZN8", "B00JM5CAHA", "B00001PE59", "B00009XN5R", "B00BDSRB2S", "B008SBXFUU", "B00CB5ERVA", "B00004W5VC", "B00IXD2N1K", "B00JAOW3MA", "B000092Q7E", "B00IBQ5M1W", "B000093NR3", "B00JK5C46E", "B000UAE7NG", "B00003CWT3", "B000007SNS", "B0000C23HY", "B000JMKK7W", "6304493703", "B000ATQYVK", "630530209X", "B00FWMVVLS", "B00062IDHE", "B0060QSGJ0", "B00HGGUS4O", "B004RV6ZW0", "B0081NASLY", "B002JT69LE", "B00IC13UCY", "B00E4XR7TG", "B0013Z7RUC", "B000088E4T", "B00FN3HRG4", "B00H3UKZ6E", "B0001IXTF4", "B00GXD6UMK", "B00JDCORSC", "B000FIHNHK", "B0002W4T9E", "B00400V6GI", "B002NOYX0E", "B000RINX8Q", "B000EOTWO2", "B0000TWMMA", "B003XYL7CK", "B000002W45", "B0007Z0O9U", "B00006FXHI", "B0006419V4", "B00005KH3H", "B0049MTTFW", "B001VB8UAE", "B0000VV4MW", "B00FBDJE8K", "B0009W5KCW", "B00005QW5X", "B005SFR7YE", "B000I2J6YG", "B00064ADMK", "B00068NVG6", "B001CHFM12", "B006ZZQMXS", "B000EWBKMG", "B00AATGDY8", "B005F265FW", "B004G8LKBU", "B00DZP1C8Q", "B000VKL6RK", "B00008G7QH", "B000059LY8", "B00CEHHL2C", "B00005JM6A", "B00000C2LN", "0312239521", "B000002W8N"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000059H81", "B000BITUNE", "B00002EIU6", "B00005NGAE"]}, "price": 10.24, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Broadway & Vocalists", "Musicals"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Vocal Pop"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Soundtracks"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 113635}, "asin": "6305669201", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/710CFZ26BTL._SY300_.gif", "title": "My Favorite Broadway: The Leading Ladies"}

{"description": "Lucio \"King of the Eyeball Gag\" Fulci made his name  with a series of gory, gooey horror epics, andThe Beyondstands above  all as his outr&eacute; masterpiece. The largely incoherent plot has something to do  with a turn-of-the-century curse and a doorway to hell in the cellar of an old New Orleans hotel. Fulci shows his usual sensitivity with wooden acting, clumsy  dialogue, and buckets of oozing blood and pus, but don't let that get in  the way of enjoying this mad tale of zombies from hell  invading Earth and eating their way through a cast of humans: crucified martyrs, blind  visionaries, creepy hotel handymen, befuddled cops, and a plucky pair of  heroes desperately fleeing a horde of hungry undead. The blood-red art  direction is eerily beautiful, and Fulci's relentless long takes, punctuated by jolting shock cuts and eruptions of grotesque violence, create a mood  of sheer paranoid horror right down to the final, mind-bending image. And  don't forget the Fulci claim to fame: eyes are gouged out, eaten away,  melted with acid, and (shudder) popped out by a spike through the back of  the skull. Yech! If you dare ignore such piddling details as narrative  logic and let yourself get carried away on the creepy visuals, it's a  deliciously stylish treat, an edgy bit of gothic gore pitched in all its  bone-crunching, flesh-ripping, organ-splatting glory. This sadistic,  sanguinary hell-spawn tale is for gore-hounds only.The DVD features chatty but largely jokey commentary by David Warbeck and  Catriona MacColl and an alternate German credits sequence featuring Fulci's preferred sepia-tinged prologue (but no alternate footage).--Sean  Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0036R92US", "B0057O6IMS", "B0002C9DK4", "B004FUPK6U", "B000S0GYRU", "B004KDYR20", "B001D5C1R6", "B000S0GYRK", "B002E01MHY", "B000KRNG54", "B0036R92UI", "B0057O6IDW", "B000T28POC", "B00LMBUR6S", "B001OBBS4Q", "B000HXDWNM", "B000096I9V", "B000MV8ZCW", "B000JU7JIW", "B00000IBRJ", "B000TZJCMS", "B00009WNXA", "B0007WQHI0", "B003NEQ74S", "B008DRKJ76", "B000HXDWRS", "B001AR0D6I", "B000YKI4U4", "B002E01MI8", "B00ARWX9NG", "B000S0GYRA", "B004WMOSKA", "B004FUPK3I", "B001B187L6", "B00LMBURDG", "B00000JT2R", "B003L1YESE", "B0002VYOVS", "B005ZHBEPI", "B000063K1F", "B0026LYMJ6", "B00004Z1GI", "0783228457", "B00005NG08", "B00LBFFR2Y", "B000RPCK2O", "B000TZJCNC", "B000AC7P5Q", "B00005KH30", "B008BWFOXM", "B000TZJCN2", "B00BCMSY80", "B000S0GYS4", "B005OT7ZWI", "B002GPVDMG", "B000IMUYJM", "B0009OUBC4", "B00005U12U", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B005CVFZ66", "B000GIXCL0", "B008CYDD7I", "157362408X", "B008I34YOE", "B003THSXJ6", "B000V6LT5S", "B0001611DI", "B000MV8ABS", "B0002C9DJU", "B00JJOY47I", "B000BB1926", "B00JV054A6", "B000IJ7A5Q", "B00B49GSQQ", "B001MEJY8W", "B000TZJCNW", "B000F3UA8E", "B00125WATQ", "B00FGAKEU0", "B0000694YT", "B003V924Y2", "B000RPCJA2", "B000E41MTU", "B000E8M0P6", "B00023P4SS", "B000V6LT6C", "B00009PY2T", "B0072GPQ8G", "1598830392", "B000067J0M", "B004KDYR1G", "B00GHH9IIA", "B00E5S2HGS", "B00BCMT2BI", "B001LIK8DO", "B00IA1VKVY", "B000T28POM", "B0001XAKUQ", "B0002DB5PO", "B003JFCG82"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002C9DK4", "B0036R92US", "B0057O6IMS", "B004KDYR20"]}, "price": 19.08, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 91834}, "asin": "6305972052", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YAWQZAA4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Beyond"}

{"description": "When Steven Spielberg was an adolescent, his first home movie was a backyard war film. When he toured Europe withDuelin his 20s, he saw old men crumble in front of headstones at Omaha Beach. That image became the opening scene ofSaving Private Ryan, his film of a mission following the D-day invasion that many have called the most realistic--and maybe the best--war film ever. With 1998 production standards, Spielberg has been able to create a stunning, unparalleled view of war as hell. We are at Omaha Beach as troops are slaughtered by Germans yet overcome the almost insurmountable odds.A stalwart Tom Hanks plays Captain Miller, a soldier's soldier, who takes a small band of troops behind enemy lines to retrieve a private whose three brothers have recently been killed in action. It's a public relations move for the Army, but it has historical precedent dating back to the Civil War. Some critics of the film have labeled the central characters stereotypes. If that is so, this movie gives stereotypes a good name: Tom Sizemore as the deft sergeant, Edward Burns as the hotheaded Private Reiben, Barry Pepper as the religious sniper, Adam Goldberg as the lone Jew, Vin Diesel as the oversize Private Caparzo, Giovanni Ribisi as the soulful medic, and Jeremy Davies, who as a meek corporal gives the film its most memorable performance.The movie is as heavy and realistic as Spielberg's Oscar-winningSchindler's List, but it's more kinetic. Spielberg and his ace technicians (the film won five Oscars: editing (Michael Kahn), cinematography (Janusz Kaminski), sound, sound effects, and directing) deliver battle sequences that wash over the eyes and hit the gut. The violence is extreme but never gratuitous. The final battle, a dizzying display of gusto, empathy, and chaos, leads to a profound repose.Saving Private Ryantouches us deeper thanSchindlerbecause it succinctly links the past with how we should feel today.

{"description": "Gosh--kids. You gotta love 'em, right? Well, not necessarily-- particularly if you're Adam Sandler. ButBig Daddyis about paternal devotion in its own oblique way. Sandler plays Sonny Koufax, a law-school grad who has been milking an accident settlement to cover his living expenses, while he continues to slack his way through life. But when his girlfriend threatens to dump him, he decides to show her he's serious about their relationship and pretends to adopt a little boy (in fact, his roommate's son from a one-night stand several years earlier, who shows up on their doorstep just after the roommate leaves town on a job). But after taking care of the tyke for a couple of days, Sonny finds that it's a little like feeding that stray dog that followed you home: Before you know it, you've grown attached to the little fella--and then what are you going to do? By turns crude and maudlin,Big Daddyhas its share of laughs and will certainly entertain fans who like Adam Sandler best when he plays the case of arrested development with a smart-aleck retort for everything.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"bought_together": ["6303610811", "0788816454"], "also_viewed": ["B00005JL93", "B00006IJDA", "B0090SI53C", "0788812807", "155890641X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 69715}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.49, "brand": "", "asin": "B00000K3UR", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XEBBHCTQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Big Daddy [VHS]"}
{"description": "It's difficult to create a film that's fast paced, exciting, and aesthetically appealing without diluting its dialogue.Run Lola Run, directed and written by Tom Tykwer, is an enchanting balance of pace and narrative, creating a universal parable that leaps over cultural barriers. This is the story of young Lola (Franka Potente) and her boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu). In the space of 20&nbsp;minutes, they must come up with 100,000&nbsp;deutsche marks to pay back a seedy gangster, who will be less than forgiving when he finds out that Manni incompetently lost his cash to an opportunistic vagrant. Lola, confronted with one obstacle after another, rides an emotional roller coaster in her high-speed efforts to help the hapless Manni--attempting to extract the cash first from her double-dealing father (appropriately a bank manager), and then by any means necessary. From this point nothing goes right for either protagonist, but just when you think you've figured out the movie, the director introduces a series of brilliant existential twists that boggle the mind. Tykwer uses rapid camera movements and innovative pauses to explore the theme of cause and effect. Accompanied by a pulse-poundingsoundtrack, we follow Lola through every turn and every heartbreak as she and Manni rush forward on a collision course with fate. There were a variety of original and intelligent films released in 1999, but perhaps none were as witty and clever as this little gem--one of the best foreign films of the year.--Jeremy Storey", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 496767}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.74, "brand": "", "asin": "B000021Y74", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KYAD2YAVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Run Lola Run [VHS]"}

{"description": "As revisionist history, Michael Mann's intelligent docudramaThe Insideris a simmering brew of altered facts and dramatic license. In a broader perspective, however, the film (cowritten withForrest GumpOscar-winner Eric Roth) is effectively accurate as an engrossing study of ethics in the corruptible industries of tobacco and broadcast journalism. On one side, there is Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe), the former tobacco scientist who violated contractual agreements to expose Brown & Williamson's inclusion of addictive ingredients in cigarettes, casting himself into a vortex of moral dilemma. On the other side is60&nbsp;Minutesproducer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), whose struggle to report Wigand's story puts him at odds with veteran correspondent Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer) and senior executives at CBS News.As the urgency of the story increases, so does the film's palpable sense of paranoia, inviting favorable comparison toAll the President's Men. While Pacino downplays the theatrical excess that plagued him in previous roles, Crow is superb as a man who retains his tortured integrity at great personal cost.The Insideris two movies--a cover-up thriller and a drama about journalistic ethics--that combine to embrace the noble values personified by Wigand and Bergman. Even if the details aren't always precise (as Mike Wallace and others protested prior to the film's release), the film adheres to a higher truth that was so blatantly violated by tobacco executives seen in an oft-repeated video clip, lying under oath in the service of greed.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002DU39GW", "B00005BCKF", "0470499052", "0314277447", "B0002XNT12", "0314904573", "B0038Z5T4Q", "074945332X", "B00337KM2S", "B003L20IG0", "630542828X", "0205667503", "B001N44BVQ", "B000H0MKOC", "B000CNESTE", "B00121QGPY", "B00441GYPG", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00004YA78", "B0001HLVS2", "B00BTYOYG2", "B000CEXEWA", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005JKG9", "B00AEFXYJA", "B000085OXZ", "B00BB67UNW", "B0035JHYGQ", "B00003CXFV", "B00004Y7Y4", "B00005JLX2", "B00AEBB95K", "B000XR9L50", "B000LXHK2C", "B000CNESU8", "B00441GYOM", "B00003CWUX", "B00A2H9VKG", "B002VWNICC", "B001AS32QK", "B000059TFO", "0780622561", "B002CPMB9O", "B0000296JH", "007337959X", "B000ARTN3I", "B002O3Z4WU", "B004SIP6C2", "B0000AM6JI", "B000OYAT3U", "B005FITIGO", "B00005JKMQ", "B0034G4P7G", "0792838947", "B00008CMRK", "B00003CXP7", "B000CQLZ8S", "B00004Z1FL", "B0001907AI", "B004SUDQ1S", "B00CLH0848", "0767817710", "B00007G1YQ", "B00008R9KG", "B000C3L2IO", "B0031OCY2E", "B00127RAGC", "B003U0AHBO", "B00JBGSHSQ", "B004IFYMWK", "B00004XPPB", "B0009OUBC4", "B004U7MR1Y", "B00008BNTD", "B001EJW0SG", "0783226845", "B003LR5BD0", "6304696507", "B0001I56FA", "B00DDY45DI", "B00GUO2SKA", "B0000YEEGM", "B000HT38IK", "B00006RCNV", "B000UGBOT0", "B000A9QK5K", "B000A9QK6E", "B00IJS2OHM", "B006DHATE6", "B0002J4X2K", "B000MXPE7O", "B004SIP7TE", "6305428115", "B00BLF9FYA", "B00AEBB9EG", "B0036TGSR6", "0783229402", "B00005BCK9", "B00004RE27"], "bought_together": ["B002DU39GW", "B003L20IG0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002DU39GW", "B000Y11B8U", "B003L20IG0", "B00005JN2Z"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17334}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.75, "brand": "Disney", "asin": "B00003CWRX", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y28RGA5AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Insider"}

Tolkien's classicThe Lord of the Rings,  but this robust adaptation maintains reverent allegiance to Tolkien's creation,  instantly qualifying as one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. At 178  minutes, it's long enough to establish the myriad inhabitants of Middle-earth,  the legendary Rings of Power, and the fellowship of hobbits, elves, dwarves, and  humans--led by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the brave hobbit Frodo  (Elijah Wood)--who must battle terrifying forces of evil on their perilous  journey to destroy the One Ring in the land of Mordor. Superbly paced, the film  is both epic and intimate, offering astonishing special effects and production  design while emphasizing the emotional intensity of Frodo's adventure.

{"description": "Many Hollywood directors should follow Rod Lurie's lead and invite their stars to do the DVD commentary. Oscar nominee Joan Allan joins Lurie, turning the commentary track into an enjoyable conversation. It tends to be a lovefest at times but does give insight into the relationship between a lead actor and director during filmmaking. Over the end credits, Lurie mentions the brouhaha that actor (and producer) Gary Oldman started when he made discouraging comments about the film's final cut. It's interesting to note none of Oldman's work ends up in the dozen deleted scenes shown on the DVD. The scenes have much more meat on the bone than most and illustrate some curious character development. The half-hour making-of featurette has the standard press-kit materials but also gives us a good background on the history of political thrillers.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783227973", "B0060ZJ7DA", "0780622561", "B001ECDVK4", "B0043X1FNQ", "B000CEXEWA", "B004IFYMWK", "B00AEFYTMQ", "B00003CWRX", "6304696507", "B00AEFYUQQ", "6305297142", "B003ASLJIQ", "B00005JNP4", "B0001V6ZJI", "B001ECDVJU", "B0059XTTW8", "0783116934", "B0013XZ2QK", "B000067IZ3", "B00005BCK9", "B00000K3TU", "0792159659", "B00005UM2X", "B000C65Z1G", "B00441GYTC", "6305428522", "B00003CXQG", "630542828X", "B002NZK5UU", "6305310335", "B00000IQC0", "B002EAYE42", "B00005OOQ2", "B002ZG993Q", "B004SIP6C2", "B005FITIGO", "B0043X1FKY", "B00004RF83", "0767802519", "B00006ZXSN", "0783229402", "B006ML50QK", "B00003CXPV", "0800141806", "B00DW5IK9S", "B000BYRCQU", "B00006L92U", "B000CQLZ8S", "B00008K76V", "B00AEBB8LA", "B000Y11B8U", "0767803434", "B007KAUWO2", "6304696515", "B003Y5H4R0", "B0000542C5", "B0011V7PSC", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00G7QQ3AC", "0790730979", "B00AEFXUXU", "B001PR0Y8K", "B00000K3CS", "B00015YVDG", "1558908382", "B00AEFXYJA", "B00008K76U", "B002DU39GW", "0792845811", "B004SIP7F8", "B000056HEA", "B0039UT3LK", "B0007IO6NM", "B00JA3RVG4", "B00G7QPXUI", "B00004XPPB", "B00005BCKF", "0764585533", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B0000SXK0E", "B000063US3", "B004FQX59I", "B00008K7AO", "B00AEFYIH2", "B00003CXFV", "B001GLX6UI", "B00006RCNY", "B0045HCJJ4", "B00BTYRB58", "6305428115", "B001AMHNKW", "B0012EBV6A", "0767811100", "B0060ZJ7AI", "B0009GX1CE", "B000HT38IK", "B00004ZBVO", "B00005ATZT"], "bought_together": ["0783227973", "0780622561"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0064470393", "0783227973"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 40208}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.99, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXP7", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/411PCH1X0RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Contender"}

{"description": "Originally developed as an epic calledKingdom of the Sun,The Emperor's New Groovelost scale and most of Sting's song score (some of which can be heard on the soundtrack) on its way to the screen. The end result is the lightest Disney film in many a moon, a joyous romp akin toAladdinin its quotient of laughs for kids and adults. The original story centers on the spoiled teenage emperor Kuzco (David Spade), who enjoys getting the best of his Aztecan subjects. When he fires Yzma (Eartha Kitt), his evil sorceress, she seeks revenge and turns Kuzco into a llama with the help of her hunk of the month, a lunk named Kronk (Patrick Warburton). Alone in the jungle, the talking llama is befriended by Pacha (John Goodman), who has just been told to vacate his pastoral home by the human Kuzco. What's an ego to do? That's pretty much the story and the characters--simple, direct, fun--a Disney film on a diet. For any fan of the acidic humor of Spade, this is essential viewing. As narrator of his tale, Kuzco uses a sarcastic tone to keep the story jumping with plenty of fun asides (he even \"stops\" the film at one point to make sure you know the story is abouthim). Even better is character actor Warburton (Elaine's stuck-up boyfriend onSeinfeld), who steals every scene as the dim-witted, but oh-so-likable Kronk. There's even a delicious Tom Jones number that starts the film off with a bang.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["0788805843", "6305229449", "B00005JKDQ", "B00005JL95", "B00005RDVV", "6302526574", "B000035Z2S", "0788812408", "B0000AQZYM", "6300275310", "6304290888", "6304401132", "6303314015", "0788802194", "6302787068", "6304089767", "6303983812", "6304500831", "B00003CX7L", "6303534422", "6302642248", "B00003CXHR", "B00005JLR1", "0788805533", "B00016JF2W", "078881172X", "6302178924", "6304978286", "0788812807", "6305326940", "6305319138", "6300274268", "6302961572", "6304100507", "155890641X", "0788806270", "0788803743", "6305940932", "6302320402", "B00004R99N", "6300274195", "6303929338", "B00003CWPW", "B00003CXXI", "6302426200", "B0000E32WB", "B00003CXG6", "B00005T7H6", "6304400551", "B00005JKX3", "6304501153", "6304089201", "0788812440", "6301991311", "0788811002", "6303036813", "B000JBWWRO", "B000B8QFYG", "6300274608", "6302158095", "B0000524CZ", "B000035Z46", "6303122647", "6305318867", "6304155972", "B00000ICHA", "B0002YLCHE", "6304401736", "0783236689", "B00004R996", "6304416415", "6304176996", "1558906150", "B0007Z9R0M", "B00006CXK5", "B00005JMQY", "0788809806", "B00006IUM9", "B00004R99A", "B00029LO18", "6304873441", "B000028U3S", "6304400225", "B0007A2GSM", "6301948106", "6301390725", "B00003CWPX", "6303929567", "6302968143", "B00004R99I", "6303232221", "078880720X", "6304434340", "B00003CXG7", "6305177473", "0788812181", "B00003CXQ6", "B000009CTR", "B000DWMYQ8"], "bought_together": ["0788805843", "6305229449"], "also_viewed": ["0788805843", "B00005JKDQ", "6304089767", "155890641X", "6303314015", "078881172X", "6302787068", "6302526574", "0788805533", "6305326940", "0788812408", "B00005JL95", "0788802194", "0788806270", "B0000AQZYM", "6302320402", "6302642248", "6303929338", "6304500831", "6303534422", "B00003CX7L", "6305229449", "6304401132", "B00005RDVV", "0788812807", "6304400551", "6304290888", "6300275310", "B000035Z2S", "6305940932", "6303983812", "B00003CXHR", "6304089201", "B00016JF2W", "6303036813", "B00006CXK5", "6302158095", "B0007KTBIU", "6300274268", "6305319138", "B00003CXG6", "B000035Z46", "6302178924", "6300274195", "B00005JLR1", "B0000E32WB", "6303122647", "6302961572", "6304100507", "B00005JKX3", "6301991311", "6304978286", "B00003CXXI", "B0000524CZ", "6303939015", "6304501153", "6302426200", "B00005T7H6", "B00004R99N"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 169967}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.39, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXQX", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CARZ3R0XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Emperor's New Groove [VHS]"}

{"description": "Five comely and well-to-do female friends receive dire threats inside anonymous valentines. When two of them meet violent ends, the remaining trio suspect that the killer may be a nebbishy former classmate whom they spurned years before at a school dance. Their solution: Throw a lavish Valentine's Day party, all the better to distract them from the hulking, cherub-masked killer...As the above suggests,Valentineis the absolute nadir of the post-Screamslasher film. Australian director Jamie Blanks (whose previous effort was the equally dismalUrban Legend, 1998) obviously had lofty goals for his film, given his bald-faced homages to John Carpenter and Dario Argento. But he hasn't a clue as to how to generate suspense, and his frequent reliance on well-worn shock effects (hands dropping on shoulders, etc.) suggests more contempt for the genre than affection. No less than four writers (including two writer-producers forRoswell, which explains the appearance of series star Katherine Heigl) contributed to the screenplay, which fails to generate the twentysomething drama and hip, cutting dialogue required for this brand of horror. As the five friends, actresses Marley Shelton, Denise Richards, Jessica Capshaw, Jessica Caufield, and Heigl have little to do other than alternately look attractive or afraid; Richards, in particular, looks weary of playing the man-eater. As Shelton's dipsomaniac boyfriend, David Boreanaz (Angel) lumbers through each scene with an embarrassed scowl.Warner Bros.' DVD includes commentary by Blanks, as well as cast and crew interviews and a video for Orgy's contribution to the noisy, new-metal soundtrack.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767824954", "B00275EHDM", "B0020PFYHC", "B00003CXLD", "B0000541TL", "B000AM4P9K", "B00005JOWW", "6305300801", "B000A5045Q", "B0002VYOVS", "B00005J761", "B002ZG99IG", "B000MM0LIM", "B000TSIJWY", "B001AV3BWM", "B000BTIU4S", "B001JFZ122", "6305017115", "B0053TWVQE", "B000F6IOAM", "B0021L8UPS", "B004LWZW2O", "B0009MWELW", "B004P7CN7W", "B001NPD9LS", "B00441GYVK", "B001QMCJ0U", "B005CFBYW6", "B002FICQFM", "B004P7CNUY", "B0002IQLH6", "B00005JMDZ", "0792840127", "B000RGN2JI", "B00005UQ9W", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B0001GF2D8", "B00003CXWM", "B00AEJM61I", "B009IV2Z3M", "B00005RYKU", "B00008LUNW", "B00G5GNYY2", "B004SUDQ1I", "B001G9CNI6", "B0000ALPFL", "B00A2H9L2E", "B000069I05", "B001MFNB8U", "B002GHHHL0", "B00003CWRF", "B00JJOY45U", "078322933X", "B000MX7V3O", "B00GHH9IIA", "B000A6T1ZY", "B000FSME9W", "B00JWXDD6O", "B0002WT4OE", "B00275EHDW", "B00006FI0R", "B00BM4Q4H6", "B000FS2W3A", "B00AJLHUA8", "B000096I9V", "B005GT3X68", "B009IV2Z7S", "B001B8XRT6", "B00006LPHA", "B000WC389G", "B00008DDVY", "B00EU8RC1S", "B000067IXO", "B000ARFPMQ", "B00HW3EJ6Y", "B005ZHBEPI", "B000A6T20S", "B000IMUYJM", "B00AZTUUQK", "B000PMLJMQ", "B000NO3DLG", "B0001ZX0GK", "B008G4T7W4", "B003M05KU0", "B0053TWV46", "B002USF1WC", "B001GCUO4S", "B0052DP1RC", "B00HRUQ7WG", "B00013RC7K", "B0013LL2YS", "B000HT38EO", "B00023P4SS", "B00001PE4D", "B002G1WPI6", "B0054602MG", "B000CCBC9O", "B000UUX2Z0", "6305238065", "B000FA57US"], "bought_together": ["0767824954"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0767824954", "B001UE7D6O", "B00275EHDM", "B005CFBYW6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23437}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 34.99, "brand": "RICHARDS,DENISE", "asin": "B00003CXUP", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JFFE1942L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Valentine"}
{"description": "Employing shock techniques and sound design in a relentless sensory assault,Requiem for a Dreamis about nothing less than the systematic destruction of hope. Based on the novel by Hubert Selby Jr., and adapted by Selby and director Darren Aronofsky, this is undoubtedly one of the most effective films ever made about the experience of drug addiction (both euphoric and nightmarish), and few would deny that Aronofsky, in following his breakthrough filmPi, has pushed the medium to a disturbing extreme, thrusting conventional narrative into a panic zone of traumatized psyches and bodies pushed to the furthest boundaries of chemical tolerance. It's too easy to call this a cautionary tale; it's a guided tour through hell, with Aronofsky as our bold and ruthless host.The film focuses on a quartet of doomed souls, but it's Ellen Burstyn--in a raw and bravely triumphant performance--who most desperately embodies the downward spiral of drug abuse. As lonely widow Sara Goldfarb, she invests all of her dreams in an absurd self-help TV game show, jolting her bloodstream with diet pills and coffee while her son Harry (Jared Leto) shoots heroin with his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and slumming girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly). They're careening toward madness at varying speeds, and Aronofsky tracks this gloomy process by endlessly repeating the imagery of their deadly routines. Tormented by her dietary regime, Sara even imagines a carnivorous refrigerator in one of the film's most memorable scenes. And yet... does any of this have a point? Is Aronofsky telling us anything that any sane person doesn't already know?Requiem for a Dreamis a noteworthy film, but watching it twice would qualify as masochistic behavior.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JM23", "6305594333", "B0007CEXYK", "B00005YUPD", "078401213X", "1560252480", "B00H3JHGBC", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005JMJG", "B000I0QL7I", "B0009A40ES", "B00049QQHI", "B00005ATQB", "B000LAZDPG", "B00003CXZ4", "0792838068", "B0000AC8LR", "0783229526", "6305692572", "B0041KKYEM", "B000QGEB1M", "B00008977H", "B001AR60GK", "B000MGB6NM", "B0045HCJ08", "6305313687", "B001TOD92C", "B00009Y3QI", "B000NO39FG", "B000JBXXYK", "B00008975Z", "6305162026", "B00004UEDQ", "B000068MC2", "B00606OZUY", "B00003CWQR", "B000ERVK4Y", "B000A7DVR2", "B000A9QK6E", "B00EUENWIY", "B0016MJ6T2", "B00005JPAR", "B00008MTXI", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEFXESQ", "B000JMK6LW", "B00004Y6Q5", "B000FVQLQQ", "B000BYA5G4", "B00005JKJA", "B00005JKM2", "B0029LHW68", "B000BBOUUE", "B004FQX5B6", "B000PAAJZ6", "B000N3SU92", "B003YKYX9M", "B00AEBB8O2", "B00007AJF8", "B00A2H9QN8", "B0009WFEDC", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00013RC2K", "B000A7Q2DM", "B00003CXWV", "0792845803", "B001URA5Y8", "B00195I3O0", "B00006AFUR", "B000063JDE", "B00BMKGZVA", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00112S8RS", "B00177YA6U", "0767837398", "B000O76ZQC", "B0052ADP6Y", "B000J10F8C", "B000E6ESU8", "B00009OOFH", "B00005JLRE", "B0059GVBHG", "0767824954", "B00005JLWN", "B00E8G5GU6", "B000QXDCLA", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00004ZETA", "B00AEBB9CS", "B000021Y77", "B00011CZRE", "B002VECM4A", "B00003CXKS", "B006KH6CF4", "B000K7VHQE", "6305127654", "B00AFEXRME", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00020HB32"], "bought_together": ["B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JM23"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JMJG", "B000MEYKD2", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JPAR"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 222264}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.36, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXP1", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519CB9K0QML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut"}

{"description": "In the first season ofThe X-Files, creator Chris Carter was uncertain of the series' future, so each of the episodes is a self-contained suspense story; they do not delve deep into the ongoing X-Files mythology or turn to self-parody and humor as do episodes in later seasons. Yet, these episodes display the elements for which the show would become famous: the cinematic production values and top-notch special effects, the stark lighting of the Vancouver sets, the atmospheric halo of Mark Snow's score, and the clever plots dealing with subjects ranging from the occult, religion, and monsters to urban legends, conspiracy theories, and science fiction. Most importantly, season&nbsp;1 introduces FBI agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Fox \"Spooky\" Mulder (David Duchovny), two of the most attractive government officials around. Scully is the serious-minded medical scientist assigned to join Mulder on the X-Files, a division of the FBI dealing with the paranormal. Mulder is the intuitive thinker with a dry wit, a passionate believer in the existence of paranormal phenomena and one of the few characters on television smart enough to figure out who the bad guy is before the audience does. Their muddled relationship, a deep friendship laced with sexual tension, provides the human heart in a world where the bizarre and horrible lurk in everyday society.The materials on the bonus disc provide some interesting trivia and background, but it is the 24 episodes themselves that make this seven-disc boxed set a true find. Those unfamiliar withThe X-Filesoften view all the fuss with the same skepticism with which Scully first regards her new partner's ideas.

The three are all in the same journalism class (acidic monologist Eric Bogosian plays the acidic professor) and decide to start and track a rumor for their term papers. They pick rich and beautiful couple Beau and Naomi (Joshua Jackson and Kate Hudson) as the focus of the rumor, and before you know it their juicy story starts spinning out of control into ugly territory and a truly ludicrous climax.

{"description": "Who delivers ten times out of ten? Samuel L. Jackson is SHAFT, the man and the movie. John Singleton (\"Boys 'n' the Hood\") directs this gritty action-packed thriller. With his uncle John Shaft (Richard Roundtree, reprising his original role) as his mentor, it's no surprise that today's Shaft is the coolest dude and the hottest action around. To stop a racist killer (Christian Bale), Shaft's got to track down the only eyewitness (Toni Collette) that can put the perpetrator behind bars. As Shaft closes in, so does the danger. Armed with attitude and up against corrupt cops and venomous druglords, he's out to make crime pay up!", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000KG4BD6", "B00008977B", "B00003W8NT", "0792838076", "1558908390", "B00AEFY6TW", "6305505780", "B0000TWMT8", "B002AT8K9W", "B000E0WJOQ", "B003VA3JZY", "B0041QSZS8", "B0000696I2", "B00008EYA5", "0780618548", "B00007AJG1", "B00000JGHV", "B008B9JTLI", "B001KKU9DM", "B00003CXGV", "B002CA68NO", "B0000JBUHI", "B00AEBB9AA", "B00151QYSK", "B004U7MR14", "B000053VBA", "B008FCX2D2", "B0001FGBUW", "6305505802", "B00004STUL", "B002VWNIEA", "B00066FAVW", "B00005LB86", "0783237367", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00066FAQW", "B000053VBC", "B000TLOMPE", "B000JYW5BO", "B00AEFYE08", "B00007L4KF", "B004SIP95G", "B002U4UZT0", "B000A2XAQ4", "6304821832", "B000056BOW", "B00DHDDE1Y", "B00009ZPUA", "B002CWKU3G", "B002CPMB9O", "B00007ELEO", "B00AEFYF2K", "B0000VJG72", "6305310335", "B001DJLD12", "B00005JLG1", "0783240295", "B00AEFY0XE", "0780627822", "0783240201", "6305428409", "B00004Y2R1", "B000YAF4Q6", "B00E1HIWU8", "0790742004", "B000JBXHQY", "B00AEFXT1S", "0792159659", "B002GHHHL0", "155890834X", "B000QXDCLU", "B000BT98XK", "B000HDZKLO", "B00124ONGA", "B002CA68N4", "0790732149", "B00AEFXEGS", "6304698747", "B003HTSJAY", "B00007AJG2", "B00005JL72", "B000U1ZV4Y", "B001JV5AZE", "B00AEBB9NM", "B00003CY51", "B002CWKU2M", "6304779631", "B003BV8I3Q", "B00177YFYM", "B00096S49Y", "B002GHHHME", "B00003L9CG", "B00005JPD0", "B004SIPAP0", "B001MZ5W3M", "B00BTYRB2G", "B0041QSZ9M", "B000P0J0CE", "B00003CXGG", "6304711891"], "bought_together": ["B000KG4BD6", "B0000TWMT8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000KG4BD6", "B001JV5AZE", "B000BT98XK", "B003VA3JZY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 44275}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B00004Z1FX", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ECQBDCKHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Shaft"}
{"description": "Following in the footsteps of such directors as the silent cinema's F.W. Murnau and Fritz Lang and the surrealists Luis Bunuel, Jean Cocteau and David Lynch comes the first feature from Canadian filmmakers Guy Maddin. Released theatrically in 1986 to acclaim from critics and audiences alike, Tales From The Gimli Hospital is now regarded as one of the true cult hits of the Eighties: a bizarre entry on the midnight movie circuit that found an eager audience and set its director's career in motion.  Set during a smallpox epidemic in the village of Gimli, Manitoba, near the turn of the century, Tales From The Gimli Hospital is a dreamlike film that explores the jealousy and madness instilled in two men who share a hospital room \"in a Gimli we no longer know.\" The two men, Einar (Kyle McCulloch) and Gunnar (Michael Gottli) are friends at first, until they share their darkest secrets. Tales of creeping pestilence, unconsummated passions, reckless envy and necrophilia are told, climaxing in a deadly battle between the two patients, now rivals. Does a better world await these two lost souls on Earth... or in Heaven?  For this Kino on Video DVD, Guy Maddin has supervised the digital transfer of the film and provided scene-specific audio commentary. Also featured are two rare short films: The Dead Father (1986, 25 Min.), about a young man's inability to cope with sudden appearances of his recently deceased dad, and Hospital Fragment (1988, 4 Min.), a tale of sexual give-and-take from the haunted Gimli universe.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00474ID4U", "B001E1B6RA", "B0019X4008", "B007JZFXBU", "1552451313", "B00062IXJW", "B001MV4A20", "B000MQ4WP6", "1894037111", "B00005Y725", "1604735635", "B0002KPHTW", "B00H206P4Q", "1552452115", "B001PMICGG", "B002VRNIGS", "B008057CZ8", "0780023161", "B007VQG1MM", "B002TOL49G", "B007R5A1EQ", "B00DCJ2ARC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00474ID4U", "B007JZFXBU", "B0019X4008", "B001E1B6RA"]}, "price": 29.73, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 303556}, "asin": "B00004Z4TF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417J570AFCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tales from the Gimli Hospital"}

{"description": "Few things in life are more deliriously satisfying than an episode ofAbsolutely Fabulous. The first series of this Britcom burst out of the gate fully formed and viciously funny: Edina Monsoon (Jennifer Saunders,French & Saunders,Shrek 2), a publicist who will drink, snort, or eat anything put in front of her, lives with her daughter Saffron (Julia Sawalha,Chicken Run), who rebels against her compulsively bohemian mother by being as sensible and straight-laced as possible. She might have some influence over the easily swayed Eddy...were it not for Edina's best friend and topnotch enabler, Patsy Stone (Joanna Lumley,The New Avengers), a terrifying fashion director who drinks and snorts even more substances than Edina. This comic triangle has chemistry beyond compare. The first season is the purest, mining the most humor from the role-reversal of Saffron trying to parent Edina and from the sheer excess of Patsy and Edina's appetites. Saunders wrote all six episodes; her dialogue sparkles like a gem and cuts like a razor, savaging every trend imaginable, mocking the fashion world, dieting, women's magazines, liposuction, collagen treatments, resisting growing old, France--nothing is sacred and nothing is spared.Absolutely Fabulousis unadulterated perfection, simply one of the funniest sitcoms ever made, British or American.

{"description": "F.W. Murnau's last German production before leaving for Hollywood is a  visually dazzling take on the Faust myth. Pushing the resources of the grand old  German studio UFA to the limits, Murnau creates an epic vision of good versus  evil as devil Emil Jannings tempts an idealistic aging scholar with youth,  power, and romance. The handsome but wan Swedish actor Gosta Ekman plays the  made-over Faust as a perfectly shallow scoundrel drunk with youth, and the  lovely Camilla Horn (in a part written for Lillian Gish) is the young virgin  courted, then cast aside, by Faust. The drama falters in the middle with a  tedious courtship and bizarre comic interludes, but the delirious images of the  opening (Jannings enveloping a mountain town in his dark cloak of evil) and the  high melodrama of the climax (Horn desperately clutching her baby while  crawling, abandoned and lost, through a snowstorm) triumphs over such  shortcomings. The sheer scale of Murnau's epic and the magnificent play of  light, shadow, and mist on his exquisitely designed sets makes this one of the  most cinematically ambitious, visually breathtaking, and beautiful classics of  the silent era.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006JMQH", "B00006JMQG", "B00005O5CA", "B000VUQ4HW", "B00180R06I", "B00917IPOQ", "B0040QYROA", "B00007CVS6", "B0000B1A1J", "B001CD6HQA", "B00007CVS8", "B0056ANHCC", "B000FS9FLW", "B00006JMQI", "B000HT3QBO", "0780022343", "B000V7HFL4", "B00000ILEU", "B00065GX64", "B000V3IXAA", "B000TEUSI6", "B0000B1O9L", "B000FS9FLM", "B00EO2I6RO", "B00917IPSW", "B00005RF2C", "B00113ALKO", "B00006JMQJ", "B00116VG2S", "B00005QW59", "B003MT2EK0", "B00005J75F", "B00064AEXI", "B00004Z4VE", "B0001UZZS6", "1559409002", "B0040QYROK", "B00005QW58", "B00064AEWY", "B00JSB19YI", "B005FQ2H0A", "B000I8OOG0", "B00D9BNONW", "B009RWRINE", "B00005B6L0", "B0001Y4MJA", "B00005O5CF", "B00J5LXMTG", "B00ITE4XUM", "B00HE010LC", "B00JPQ1IMY", "B009KG7F30", "B003Y58CKI", "B0009S4IKG", "B0007TKNHY", "B000FS9FLC", "B0013K8J90", "B003TTZTC8", "B0083Q4JXM", "B004C2523M", "B000V3IX82", "B005D0RDKM", "B0002DCHQA", "B00480OCCU", "B0063E00HU", "B00IPAORL0", "B00EVU3SO0", "B00JGR3M26", "B00FJYXP36", "B00AZFECHW", "B001M9ELJE", "B00009ME9Z", "B001SMC9L2", "B004OOL73W", "B003WKL6YE", "B002MZZUGK", "B00GG0NABE", "B0000AKY54", "B000E8JO32", "B005D0RDNY", "B005J7K9CI", "B00005YJMX", "B00AFQSZB0", "B007N5YJMU", "B001WLMOL4", "B00009PY4A", "B002NTDX6O", "B00G3HOJZ6", "B0081XAQNE", "B000063UR0", "B008BWFOXM", "B001BSBBIK", "B000SFJ4KE", "B007N5YJPC", "B009AGEY98", "B00I06G1K4", "B00HVOFP9O", "B001BSBBIA", "B00E5G03BQ", "B008FL8OTK"], "bought_together": ["B00006JMQH", "B00006JMQG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003Y58CKI", "B00006JMQG", "B000VUQ4HW", "B00005O5CA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 277699}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 22.15, "brand": "Kino International", "asin": "B00005ASOS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515WKJY3APL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Faust"}

{"description": "Though he had made comedies with Robert De Niro (Hi Mom,Greetings!), a horror movie (Sisters), and a rock musical (Phantom of the Paradise), it wasn't until this 1976 film that Brian De Palma truly announced himself as the heir to Alfred Hitchcock. Written by Paul Schrader, this film is an homage toVertigo, with its own stylish twists and turns. Cliff Robertson plays a businessman who, while traveling in Italy, meets a young woman (Genevieve Bujold) who is a dead ringer for his late wife, who had been killed in a kidnapping years earlier. As he woos and wins her, the vibes get creepier and creepier because, well, something's not right about this woman. Interestingly, this film came out the same year as De Palma'sCarrie, a much more successful movie at the box office. But it was this movie that, for all its flaws, proclaimed De Palma as a stylist with a sure-handed command of visual storytelling.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000H5TH1Q", "B00005K3NU", "B00005LIRC", "B00004W3HG", "B00005K3NV", "0783228449", "B00005LIRB", "B0009HMTKI", "B000ELL1R6", "B00JVQ7PWU", "B00EVU3T26", "B005OT82ZC", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B004DSCMLA", "B00JX3SHIC", "B003XF1VY8", "B00HW3EJ6Y", "B0058O1FES", "B00005O06R", "B00J7YV0UE", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B004Y72Y4K", "B008Y5OWSO", "B000244EWO", "6305428085", "B00CVB6XF2", "B0082LUEFA", "B00HT2L7VS", "B000YDOOSM", "B0009298N4", "B00CUKTHES", "B0007GAG42", "B009X919UE", "B00IYJRIKO", "B0006HBV3C", "B000CCW2SY", "0767817729", "B0024FAG8A", "B00JPUUSSU", "B000EOTTY0", "0792844874", "B0045HCJ8A", "B00AEBB8W4", "B002AMVEII", "B00ICWO1LC", "B00AQ6J64O", "B0009GX1CE", "B000068TPG", "0790742446", "B00C7T0EPS", "B00013D580", "B000CCW2U2", "B00CPTUOI2", "B00062IVM6", "0792846877", "B00074DY0M", "B001QFFBAM", "B004DK9DQ0", "B000ECX0RY", "B00H9HZITU", "B0006SSQSY", "B00AEBB8JM", "B00AEFXJF4", "B001ARDBWG", "B0008ENI98", "B0030Y12F0", "B00023P4U6", "B0089LT7ZG", "B001BGS17Q", "B00FPUN21O", "B000G6BLYM", "B008WAM2E2", "B004VQRCHS", "B00AG6NO7O", "B00DX88J9A", "B00BGARG3C", "B00DNJ96MS", "B0043X1FNQ", "B000HWZ4D4", "B00000IPHP", "B00005O06Q", "B00AEFYO5I", "B0007ZEO8C", "B00005V9HX", "B00000JT2R", "B00008L3S6", "B000069I0A", "B00027JYNK", "B00HE011DE", "B00013RC66", "B00HT2RTU6", "B003XTOBU0", "B00026L8US", "B00782O7MA", "B000E8JO32", "078062856X", "B001DZOCY6", "B0008JGQN8", "B000056BP1", "B000LC4ZCG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["078322947X", "B00005LIRB"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 176465}, "asin": "B00005J6US", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YHKJPDT1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Obsession"}
{"description": "With its modest special effects, lean plot, and small cast of lesser  stars, this 1951 thriller remains a sturdy blueprint for fusing horror and  science fiction. The formula has been employed countless times since, fleshed  out with more extensive and elaborate production values, and manned by higher profiled marquee names, but the results have yet to improve onThe Thing from Another World, Howard Hawks's lone foray into sci-fi.The story begins as military airmen are dispatched to a remote Arctic research station where scientists have detected the crash of a spacecraft.  An effort to retrieve the saucer-shaped vehicle fails, but the team returns to the station with the frozen body of its sole occupant. When the extraterrestrial pilot is accidentally thawed, the crew, headed by a tough-talking pilot (Kenneth Tobey), grapples with a massive, chlorophyll-based humanoid (James Arness) thirsty for blood and in no mood for galactic diplomacy.Hawks takes only a production credit for this low-budget exercise, but his filmmaking style transcends Christian Nyby's nominal direction: rapid-fire, overlapping dialogue, an ensemble of comrades whose professionalism is tempered by wisecracks, and unsentimental female characters (embodied by feisty romantic interest Margaret Sheridan) recall Hawks's signature works, while propelling the plot over any potential gaps in credibility. It's hardly surprising, then, thatThe Thing from Another Worldremains among the most influential science fiction movies ever shot, or that it remains exciting entertainment a half century later.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKFR", "0783240953", "6303257801", "6302120101", "B00007JME0", "B000AQKU72", "B000DZC5PA", "B007Y1NNAW", "6300183084", "B00005R1O7", "6302890721", "0790731975", "6304507348", "0792835077", "6301977742", "0783236352", "6301977149", "6301968948", "6300208508", "B0000068SI", "B000JTATHG", "6301661729", "6304429274", "6300247589", "0790752395", "6302526191", "B000HDNPM0", "6303398375", "630442972X", "6303953492", "6302763835", "6301976401", "0783103107", "6300215539", "6302843200", "630168740X", "6300213900", "6300216500", "6300181278", "6302841798", "6300213838", "6302182530", "6300269477", "6300185281", "6300247597", "6301562178", "0790736055", "6300182533", "6300181340", "B00004R67T", "630258793X", "6303082815"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKFR", "B007Y1NNAW"], "also_viewed": ["B0067QPVJ6", "6300182878", "B000FOPPEC", "6303506291", "B00005JKFR", "6300247171", "B0045HCJKS", "B00AEBB8VK", "B00IYJFB2G"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 345640}, "asin": "B00005JG70", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5120YBRYW7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Thing From Another World [VHS]"}

The town develops its own offbeat personality as well, a Mayberry-meets-Twin-Peaks  blend of Native mysticism, Aurora Borealis-induced dreams, unlikely tales of long-lost family members, and rumors of a Bigfoot-like creature known simply as \"Adam.\"Northern Exposureprovides a utopian escape--a place where life is interesting but never dangerous, everyone's insightful, the mystical becomes real, and nobody's burdened with a mundane 9-to-6 desk job. Cicely is a delightful place to visit, even if it's only for an hour at a time.A mid-season replacement, season 1 consists of just eight episodes on two DVDs. Each episode includes 5-10 minutes of outtakes and deleted scenes.--Shane Burnett", "related": {"also_bought": ["B006WK4Y8Q", "B00FWMVVK4", "B00FWMVVI6", "B00FWMVVKY", "B00FWMVVHC", "B000002OMG", "B000K7VHJ6", "B000002OT2", "B00D2UMHVA", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B000F8O2MO", "B000TGURZ8", "B00GOC74I4", "B00GHP8SS8", "B0017KP8Y0", "B000EOTTS6", "B000FTC1GW", "B000CQM4YM", "B00GOC74QG", "B000UX6THK", "B000H1RFXM", "B00308BANA", "B000FA57U8", "B0007WQHFS", "B000DZ95IU", "B007USE5CE", "B00I4581F4", "B0000DFZ5O", "B00GLT2TR6", "B008MCKLAM", "B004HJ0ZN2", "B00BNAE6M4", "B003XJABZO", "B008MCKL5W", "B00005Y71F", "B000S0KYTE", "B0027CSMY0", "B0050MB3I6", "B000PHX5KU", "B00DMH1DJA", "B0009NSCRQ", "B00DYQ1G78", "B003R4ZMQI", "B000V6LSO0", "B009LDD4V4", "B0001CCXZW", "B005IA9JQ8", "B0049GYXH2", "B00BPW65OW", "B002C6A6N6", "B00DL48BM6", "B00GOC75YW", "B00HNGC56G", "B00DXLO086", "B00BN3DUVE", "B00KM9MP9I", "B000E1ZBGS", "B00EIXWW2O", "1451666179", "B009DS6YGO"], "bought_together": ["B006WK4Y8Q", "B00FWMVVK4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EOTTS6", "B000V6LSO0", "B006WK4Y8Q", "B00FWMVVKY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 81938}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 13.56, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

{"description": "There's only one deleted scene in this two-disc DVD set, but it's a doozy. The \"Sgt. Candy Scene\" is a must-see and, unfortunately, the best thing on the second disc. The rushed HBO documentary shows us far more flash than substance. Better is the Visual Effects Lab that goes more in-depth with four sequences, although you need to wade through a hokey interface for each segment. Making your \"own\" effects isn't that much fun; you can only choose a few effects that change in two scenes. Anyone looking to get the complicated backstory of the trilogy figured out should dig into the \"Sky Net Database\" and an intricate timeline. The two commentary tracks are worth a listen, with director Jonathan Mostow's solo track the better one. The director goes into great detail on how the little things (from lighting street scenes to tricks for destroying buildings) count.  The second track is pieced together from the actors recorded separately. Mostow appears with actress Claire Danes (doing her first commentary track) and their chemistry is enjoyable after a slow start. The other actors have less interesting things to say, including Schwarzenegger who is constantly--yet enthusiastically--selling the film.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5", "B001FB55HQ", "B00005JA8B", "B00070FX5U", "B00007AJG4", "B002ZG98LO", "B000T9OP7G", "B002GHHHME", "B00005JKIP", "B002QFYJFY", "B0002J58HO", "B0000AXE8I", "B001AQO43M", "B00AKGG828", "B00026ZG10", "B0001BKAEY", "B00IZZDWKM", "B001451HXO", "B0000VCZK2", "B000056PMU", "B000BPL2FQ", "B000RW3VCK", "B0004Z33F0", "B000U1ZV8K", "B0045HCJGC", "B0004Z33EQ", "B00005JNTU", "B000HRMAPE", "B00008G8M4", "B000RRS7RE", "B00005JKYX", "B0000VD12I", "B000FC2FQA", "B00000ILDG", "B00000G3PA", "B00005JMZK", "B000MGBSE4", "B0087ZG7J8", "B0004Z33EG", "B000P0J0AQ", "B00005JMEW", "B0087ZG7NO", "B00003CXTA", "B0002CHK1S", "B000RJO56E", "B00177YA1K", "B00004STDN", "B005COLETU", "B001AK3S4Y", "B000VNMMR0", "B0000959N0", "B00005JMUA", "1558908846", "6305767866", "B001RIY4WE", "B0049IHX2C", "B000VI70QS", "B000EGDB10", "B002GSXKN8", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B0045HCJ9O", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00005JNJV", "B001451HX4", "B00I9TDMRM", "B0006GANOQ", "B00003CXSP", "6305428115", "B00016MSV2", "B00005JOC9", "B000TJBN80", "B009MO57H6", "B000O77SQS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B001OST0M6", "B005LAIHXQ", "B0002J4X1Q", "B0002V7OI8", "B0015XHP2C", "6304806434", "B000QXDED6", "B00005JL3K", "B008JFUPFI", "B003PIUINS", "0783225946", "0792839056", "B00005N7Z1", "B0006GAO6I", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00005JL78", "B001HN697M", "B00IJS2OXG", "B002NXSRVG", "B00008G8M5", "B00005JN0T", "B003XURDAY", "B000O77SRM", "B006VRRGNK", "B00F4FFO8E"], "bought_together": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5", "B001FB55HQ", "B002JT6AO0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 115564}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.47, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JM0B", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5143TFPX8SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Three men relive their carefree college years by killing off as many  brain cells as possible in this over-the-top comedy. Mitch (Luke Wilson)  returns home from a less-than-pleasant business trip one evening to  discover his wife, Heidi (Juliette Lewis), involved in a m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois  with two blindfolded strangers. Feeling less than welcome at home after  this, Mitch rents a house near the campus of a nearby college; two of  Mitch's old college buddies, Beanie (Vince Vaughn) and Frank (Will  Ferrell), stop by to cheer him up. They soon become regular guests at  Mitch's place, despite the fact that Frank only recently wed Marissa  (Perrey Reeves), while Beanie and his wife, Lara (Leah Remini), are busy  with two kids. Beanie decides to throw a housewarming party for Mitch,  and since Beanie sells audio equipment for a living, he's able to trick  out the big bash with a massive PA system and an appearance by Snoop  Dogg. Mitch soon finds he's the not-entirely-willing proprietor of the  school's leading party spot, which raises the ire of Pritchard (Jeremy  Piven), a dean at the college who was the target of Mitch, Frank, and  Beanie's abuse when they were all students. Pritchard arranges to have  Mitch's neighborhood zoned into a student housing district, but Beanie  and Frank respond by forming a fraternity and making Mitch's home their  headquarters. Mitch, however, is not enthusiastic about the idea,  especially as he's trying to impress Nicole (Ellen Pompeo), a beautiful  divorcee who is less than enchanted with Frank and Beanie's \"party  hearty\" lifestyle.Old Schooldirector Todd Phillips knows more than a  bit about the seamy side of fraternity life as director of the infamous  unreleased documentaryFrat House.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BKVQS4", "B001G5T6GW", "B000J4P9P8", "B000WZEZGI", "B00005JMYI", "B00005JNZU", "B0016MOV92", "B00AEFXJS6", "B001OD4S50", "B0009HBPN0", "B002ZG99H2", "B00AEFYZCU", "B001J9KJ4I", "B00AEFYPXY", "B000EMGJAO", "B008220BGQ", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B004EPZ084", "B000JJ4DNW", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B00005JKMN", "B000069CF0", "B0000A02TZ", "B008R65XNS", "B002IKIHEG", "B00AEFYAMA", "B000BKJ762", "B003Y5H5B0", "B000IZJZIU", "B00AEBB9K0", "B000CPH9PM", "B00AEBBA2C", "B0050PYNN0", "B003CRM6PA", "B000AP04L0", "630529142X", "B00B65JMEI", "B0006GANPA", "B000TZJBPQ", "B003VPX5Y4", "B002ZG97XI", "B004EPYZS0", "B00466HN7M", "B001C0JCBA", "B0083XXVFW", "B000A7DVR2", "B00029RTAI", "B00CE00ZV8", "B005LAII12", "B00007AJGM", "B008R65XYC", "B00BEIYMZ6", "B000ELJAEM", "B008R65XTC", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEFXVW0", "B00AIQARTU", "B00003CXWV", "B000P0J09M", "B00005JMX6", "B004HO6I2E", "B002BIULKS", "B00AEFZ3XU", "B0012IWNZY", "B00BNWWYE4", "B0023TCWE8", "B00363WGBO", "0783229526", "B00AEBB9DM", "B0002V7TMY", "B000E6EHE0", "B0009X761E", "B00029RTCG", "B0002F6BRE", "B0002I84FI", "B0051MKNRC", "B003BV8IC2", "B00005JL93", "B000EGDBZ6", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00AEFYFWA", "B000P0J09W", "B00DV2MVWO", "B008R65XUQ", "B000M341QE", "B00AEBB9GY", "B00003CXPS", "B000HCPS94", "B005LAII2Q", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00AEFXIUK", "B00407PO3W", "B00AEFY5B6", "B004EPZ06G", "B004LWZW5G", "B00AEFZ8OY", "B003Y5H5C4", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEFYVMO", "B00004Z4WR"], "bought_together": ["B001G5T6GW", "B000J4P9P8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001G5T6GW", "B000WZEZGI", "B000J4P9P8", "B003Y5H5B0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 27583}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JM1F", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MFGXVNN8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Old School (Widescreen Unrated Edition)"}

{"description": "In terms of alluring female nudity,Swimming Poolshows a lot, but it's what remains concealed that gives this erotic thriller a potent, voyeuristic charge. With his Hitchcockian handling of secrets and lies, prolific French director Fran&#xE7;ois Ozon reunites with hisUnder the Sandstar, Charlotte Rampling, to tell a seductive tale of murder and complicity, beginning when British mystery novelist Sarah Morton (Rampling) seeks peace and relaxation at her publisher's French villa, only to find his brash, sexually liberated daughter Julie (Ludivine Sagnier) arriving shortly thereafter to disrupt her solitary reverie. What begins as mutual annoyance turns into something more sinister and duplicitous, alternating between Julie's predatory sex with men and Sarah's observant, perhaps jealous fascination.

{"description": "Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen play good girl/bad girl sisters who suddenly find themselves on a high-speed chase escaping crooks, attracting hunks, and wreaking havoc in this lightweight comedy set in the Big Apple. Ashley plays high school scholar Jane Ryan, an overachiever with her sights set on winning a college scholarship competition. Mary-Kate plays her sister, Roxy, a rebellious teen truant who would rather be a rock star than a student. Since their mother's death, the sisters' relationship has been strained. Now their worlds collide when a day in Manhattan forces Jane and Roxy to join forces, overcoming their differences to battle an international smuggling ring while trying to make it in time for Jane's competition. While the script is predictably bland, viewers will enjoy the comedic strengths of Eugene Levy (Serendipity,American Pie) as Roxy's ubiquitous truant officer. Though the twins manage some decent slapstick, their sensuality, sexual innuendo, and suggestive disrobing is disappointing. DVD bonus features include some hilarious bloopers and alternate endings.

{"description": "Like any DVD blockbuster from producer Jerry Bruckheimer, the extras are plentiful and often a bit too self-congratulatory (worst offender here is the primary commentary track). The slickly (natch) produced making-of documentary goes through the standard routine; however, the less-flashy \"fly on the wall\" bits--just showing what happens on set without comment--is more fun, offering effortless insight on the filmmaking process. The best treasure is a nifty interactive history on pirates with plenty of background material. You can simply play the filmed segments or take a tour around a ship to discover the material (and a few surprises). There's a lot of archival material on the theme-park ride that inspired the film and several odds and ends including an enjoyable chronicle of the vintage ship's voyage from its home harbor to the movie set. The kids should really dig the DVD-ROM \"Moonlight Becomes Ye,\" in which they can turn their own mug into a ghostly pirate. There's also a bounty of extended and deleted scenes (19 in all) and a very funny blooper reel. With both DTS and Dolby 5.1, sound systems will get a workout with the excellent (and loud) sound design.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000I0RQVI", "B000U7WV1Y", "B005COPWZW", "B004A8ZWUQ", "B00005JN5E", "B0013BM63O", "B006VRRGNK", "B00005JKZV", "B00005JPH2", "B0014Z4OMU", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00003CWT6", "B004DTLK80", "B00005JKZY", "B0000A1RJI", "B004M1A21K", "B004DTLK7G", "B00003CXZ1", "B001HN694K", "B001E75QH0", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00005JKCH", "B0087ZG7HK", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B000E6EK2Y", "B000E8M0VA", "B003UYUQZW", "B00AEFYGBA", "B000W746GK", "B00005JMQW", "B0083SBMBM", "B001DHXT20", "B0002234LS", "B000W7F5SS", "B002PMV9FG", "B0002KVUKM", "B004EPYZUS", "B0053FANRC", "B00BEZTMFY", "6304806434", "B000VR0570", "0783231644", "B001OQCV6A", "B000AYELVA", "B008JFUO72", "B005G4TJUC", "B00004R99S", "B00023B1LC", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00003CXI1", "B001HQZJMU", "B00000IRE6", "B0002ZDVEU", "B008QE9XD2", "B00F84H73Q", "B00E5I2MEK", "B003Y5H5EW", "B007K3JFUQ", "B003QO8TOQ", "B000NQRR1Q", "B000YPUF9W", "B001EZE5BU", "B004A8ZWSS", "B0009MDPYM", "B00LG6YEKE", "B002ZG980U", "B002ZG994U", "B000U1ZV8K", "B001DZ8TRW", "B00005JLR2", "B000VWYJ86", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00000JQB5", "B004XKCZAG", "B000W796OM", "B001GCUO0W", "B00AQSN7HE", "B00000ILDH", "B0053FANT0", "B0000VAFO0", "B0002IQMAM", "B000HRMAPE", "B004LWZW7Y", "B008UZA8FY", "B0001HLVS2", "B00007AJGH", "B00005JNJV", "B003YAR97K", "B00CHVJODE", "B000UR9T8C", "B0049IHX2C", "B000G6BLW4", "B00177YA1K", "0783227345", "B0014Z4ON4", "B001TK80C0", "B002O5M4T4", "B00AEBBA72", "B00005JOC9"], "bought_together": ["B000I0RQVI", "B000U7WV1Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005COPWZW", "B000I0RQVI", "B0071JADFU", "B00005JPFX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6260}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.23, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JM5E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51fX40gGdXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "The supplemental features ofFahrenheit 9/11offer almost an hour and a half of further manna for Michael Moore's supporters and ammunition for his critics, including appearances by two of the most memorable figures in the film, Michigan mother Lila Lipscomb and Marine corporal Abdul Henderson.  \"The Release ofFahrenheit 9/11\" (11 minutes) collects reactions to the film from celebrities, political leaders, and Quentin Tarantino and Tilda Swinton of the 2004 Cannes Film Festival jury (but no film critics).  Lipscomb gives a moving speech at the film's Washington, D.C. premiere (4 minutes), and in an 18-minute sequence, an embedded Swedish journalist recounts his experiences, accompanied by footage of U.S. soldiers raiding an Iraqi home.  This provides the context for the scene in the main film in which a soldier gets his picture taken with a bound and hooded Iraqi, which is chillingly similar to the infamous pictures from Abu Ghraib prison.  The second part of the DVD features consists of seven new or extended scenes (about 50 minutes total), including more footage of Iraq before the invasion; protesters outside Abu Ghraib and former prisoners showing their injuries; more thoughts from Cpl. Abdul Henderson; National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice trying to squirm off the hook in front of the 9/11 Commission; and President Bush going through the motions of a press appearance after he appeared before the same commission.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000UNYJXQ", "B0030Y11XS", "B00008DDVV", "B00009YXAS", "B00008K76O", "B0030Y11O2", "B0002RQ2Q2", "B001G43C1S", "B00008L3TE", "B0041KKYBA", "B00068VAOG", "B000T28C5Y", "B000ICL3KG", "B000BTH4K4", "B002FOQY7M", "B0002OXVBO", "B001NMT8R0", "B001MFNB5I", "B001MVWFAO", "0743272927", "B000FBH3W2", "B0007DBJM8", "B000UYX4N6", "B0027BOL4G", "B000U6YJMO", "B00G0PXU2Y", "B00005JPXA", "B000GYHRHO", "B002EP8TQG", "B000C3L2IO", "B000JVSUSE", "B004EPYZDA", "B0016N52IK", "B001BEK8FQ", "B0041KKYBK", "B00KY6YAO2", "B00F12IRSO", "B00DYC648S", "B001F5274G", "B0001L3LUE", "B000HWXOT0", "B005FITIGO", "B003CJXJ8Q", "B0013D8LHM", "B00DPUB5LK", "044653224X", "B005KBJC0I", "B004FQX59I", "B00KUS5YGC", "B007KAUWO2", "B00GYG8BKK", "B000093NQZ", "B001P9G3HE", "B00483VQTE", "B003Q6D28C", "B001B7CNW4", "B000BBOUHM", "B00744WZ8U", "B00066VTBW", "B001KWB0L0", "B00443YDWK", "B000059TG8", "B000JLTRIQ", "B003JUINFM", "0060392452", "B000I5Y8FU", "B000BITURA", "B003XKNGLY", "B004EPYZDK", "B003M987AG", "B000PY52IG", "B006ML50QK", "B000QGE89W", "B00EK52XQK", "B00DENQEE6", "B000GH3CR0", "B0047UJBP4", "B00005J75F", "0446693790", "B0006N2DSI", "B001AEF6HM", "B00005JLYW", "B001J66JQI", "B000O0YV7O", "B002NPCJRC", "B00AZMFG48", "B0042KZJIC", "B00827OX5Q", "B0002HDXTQ", "B001E5FYS8", "B00AEBB89C", "B003H23KSM", "B000CEXEWA", "0615602223", "B006JN86VW", "B00914YLAG", "B0001IXT36", "B008PUI1GM", "B004SIP7ZS"], "bought_together": ["B000UNYJXQ", "B0030Y11XS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000UNYJXQ", "B0030Y11XS", "B00008DDVV", "B0002OXVBO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 44430}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.0, "brand": "From HIBISCUS EXPRESS, http://www.amazon.com/shops/AXD9LOVGJXES3", "asin": "B00005JNEI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KDRVF1JGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fahrenheit 9/11"}

{"description": "With the slimmest extras package for a Pixar film debuting on DVD,Carsstill shines for home viewing. As with earlier digital-to-digital transfers, the film sounds and looks stunning. There is only one behind-the-scenes feature, a 16-minute cursory but entertaining glance at director John Lasseter's influences (his dad was a car-parts manager), including some of the real-life inspiration for the film such as Michael Wallis's influential book on Route 66 (he also voiced the sheriff). There's a new cartoon for the DVD, \"Mater and Ghost Light,\" which is smile-inducing at best. Four deleted scenes (in storybook format with voices) also show a darker tone the movie may have taken at one point. Best is the adorable short \"One Man Band\" that showed theatrically with the film, and the film's credit sequence can be seen full screen without the credits (and find the Easter egg for an extended version).

{"description": "Movies don't come any bigger than Peter Jackson'sKing Kong, a three-hour remake of the 1933 classic that marries breathtaking visual prowess with a surprising emotional depth. Expanding on the original story of the blonde beauty and the beast who falls for her, Jackson creates a movie spectacle that matches hisLord of the Ringsfilms and even at times evokes their fantasy world while celebrating the glory of '30s Hollywood. Naomi Watts stars as Ann Darrow, a vaudeville actress down on her luck in Depression-era New York until manic filmmaker Carl Denham (a game but miscast Jack Black) entices her with a lead role. Dazzled by the genius of screenwriter Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody), Ann boards the tramp steamer S.S.Venture, which she--and most of the wary crew--believes is headed for Singapore. Denham, however, is in search of the mythic Skull Island, hoping to capture its wonders on film and make a fortune. What he didn't count on were some scary natives who find that the comely Darrow looks like prime sacrifice material for a mysterious giant creature....There's no point in rehashing the entire plot, as every movie aficionado is more than familiar with the trajectory ofKing Kong; the challenge facing Jackson, his screenwriters, and the phenomenal visual-effects team was to breathe new life into an old, familiar story. To that degree, they achieve what could be best called a qualified success. Though they've assembled a crackerjack supporting cast, including Thomas Kretschmann as theVenture's hard-bitten captain and young Jamie Bell as a plucky crewman, the first third of the movie is rather labored, with too much minute detail given over to sumptuous re-creations of '30s New York and the unexciting initial leg of theVenture's sea voyage. However, once the film finds its way to Skull Island (which bears more than a passing resemblance toLOTR's Mordor),Kongturns into a dazzling movie triumph, by turns terrifying and awe-inspiring. The choreography and execution of the action set pieces--including one involving Kong and a trio of Tyrannosaurus Rexes, as well as another that could be charitably described as a bug-phobic's nightmare--is nothing short of landmark filmmaking, and a certain Mr. Spielberg should watch his back, asKongtrumps most anything that has come before it.Despite the visual challenges ofKing Kong, the movie's most difficult hurdle is the budding romance between Ann and her simian soulmate. Happily, this is where Jackson unqualifiedly triumphs, as this unorthodox love story is tenderly and humorously drawn, by turns sympathetic and wondrous. Watts, whose accessibility balances out her almost otherworldly loveliness, works wonders with mere glances, and Andy Serkis, who digitally embodies Kong here much as he did Gollum in theLOTRfilms, breathes vibrant life into the giant star of the film without ever overplaying any emotions. The final, tragic act of the film, set mostly atop the Empire State Building, is whereKongearns its place in movie history as a work that celebrates both the technical and emotional heights that film can reach.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"bought_together": ["B000EHQTZO", "B00AEFYEU8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EHQTZO", "B00AEFYEU8", "B0087ZG7HK", "0767817478"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 32487}, "categories": [["Movies & TV"]], "price": 8.94, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JO20", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513Y54TGdwL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "King Kong (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Critics and controversy aside,The Da Vinci Codeis a verifiable blockbuster. Combine the film's huge worldwide box-office take with over 100 million copies of Dan Brown's book sold, andThe Da Vinci Codehas clearly made the leap from pop-culture hit to a certifiable franchise. The leap for any story making the move from book to big screen, however, is always more perilous. In the case ofThe Da Vinci Code, the plot is concocted of such a preposterous formula of elements that you wouldn&#x92;t envy screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, the man tasked with making this story filmable. The script followsDan Brown&#x92;s bookas closely as possible while incorporating a few needed changes, including a better ending. And if you&#x92;re like most of the world, by now you&#x92;ve read the book and know how it goes: while lecturing in Paris, noted Harvard Professor of Symbology Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is summoned to the Louvre by French police to help decipher a bizarre series of clues left at the scene of the murder of the chief curator. Enter Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), gifted cryptologist. Neveu and Langdon team up to solve the mystery, and from there the story is propelled across Europe, ballooning into a modern-day mini-quest for the Holy Grail, where secret societies are discovered, codes are broken, and murderous albino monks are thwarted&#x85; oh, and alternative theories about the life of Christ and the beginnings of Christianity are presented too, of course. It&#x92;s not the typical formula for a stock Hollywood thriller. In fact, taken solely as a mystery, the movie almost works--despite some gaping holes--mostly just because it keeps moving. Brown&#x92;s greatest trick was  to have the entire story take place in one day, so the action is forced to keep moving, despite some necessary pauses for exposition. As a screen couple, Hanks and Tautou are just fine together but not exactly memorable; meanwhile Sir Ian McKellen&#x92;s scenery-chewing as pivotal character Sir Leigh Teabing is just what the film needed to keep it from taking itself too seriously. The whole thing is like a good roller-coaster ride: try not to think too much about it--just sit back and enjoy the trip.--Daniel VanciniVisit The Da Vinci Code StoreOn The DVDThe DVD extras on a film as popular asThe Da Vinci Codeshould be plentiful, and this version doesn&#x92;t skimp. With over 90 minutes of special features, including ten behind-the-scenes featurettes, there&#x92;s a lot here to explore beyond the film itself. The question is, is there anything new here that we haven&#x92;t heard before, in all the hype, pseudo-documentaries, and controversy surrounding the movie, to make it worthwhile?  For most viewers, the answer will be \"yes.\" Essentially, if you like the movie, if you enjoyed the book, you will get a lot out of them.Just as the movie is intended to make the book come to life, the DVD extras should make the film come to life by pointing the audience into the world of the filmmakers, connecting the dots between print and film, and for the most part they do just that. The extras here range from the typical look behind-the-scenes to more in-depth features on the supporting characters, the locations, and theMona Lisaherself.  \"First Day on the Set with Ron Howard\" features the director gushing about the opportunity to film in the Louvre and work with Tom Hanks again (the two worked together before onSplashandApollo 13). It&#x92;s a short piece that doesn&#x92;t reveal much beyond making an attempt to share Howard&#x92;s excitement (with the \"Gee, I really loved working with him/her on this project\" that you hear in every such featurette), but viewers might enjoy seeing how the stage was set up in the famous museum, down to the spike tape on the floor showing actors where to hit their marks.The Filmmaking Experience, Parts 1 and 2further explores the creative and technical aspects of the filmmaking process.A Conversation with Dan Brownstarts out feeling like a puff-piece (the man who wrote this book got started at age 5 with a story calledThe Giraffe, The Pig, and the Pants on Fire. \"It was a thriller,\" he says.) and unfortunately it doesn&#x92;t go very deep into much of anything of interest. But on the other hand, this isn&#x92;t60 Minuteshere; it&#x92;s intended to give viewers a better sense of the man behind the franchise, which it does.  Much of the footage from this interview is sprinkled throughout some of the other featurettes. Meanwhile, the character behind the franchise, Robert Langdon, is examined in his own featurette, as is Sophie Neveu. The cool thing here is getting under the skin of the actors to see how they approached the characters, knowing that most of the movie-going public already has formed their own ideas about the characters from the book.The most interesting extras are the featurettes that focus on the history behind the mystery. Or is it the mystery behind the history?  Either way, the first one on theMona Lisa, and the second featurette on the many codes and symbols that are hidden throughout the movie balance out the remainder of the extras nicely by demonstrating the sense of intrigue, mystery, and game-playing adventure that madeThe Da Vinci Codeso popular in the first place.--Daniel VanciniBeyondThe Da Vinci CodeThe Films of Tom HanksThe Films of Ron HowardThe Da Vinci DVDs: Decoding \"The Da Vinci Code\"More About The ArtistStills fromThe Da Vinci Code(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00005JN5E", "B0013BM63O", "B002ZTQVKM", "B0007XG02W", "B001OLP2TI", "B002C68WNW", "0307474275", "B002O5M4SU", "B00005JLSB", "B000PHVZNE", "B0077ATSSQ", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000EPR7NE", "0743486226", "B001LMAK9W", "B000P0J0EW", "0385504209", "B005HWAOP2", "B001OQCV2E", "B0013XZ2QK", "B001EZE5D8", "B00005JL3T", "B000EOTW0Q", "6304711891", "B000YDBPAM", "0307950689", "B000HT386M", "B00008G8M4", "B000P0J0EM", "B002ZG99KO", "0800141806", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00001ZWUS", "B0002V7OI8", "B002O3Z50Q", "B0006GANOQ", "B002NZK5UU", "B000NQRR1Q", "0385504225", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00005Y71F", "B000OYC7BW", "B00DL48BM6", "B00026ZG10", "B0018CWW5K", "B00004BZIY", "B0000B1OFL", "B00023B1LC", "B000N6U0E2", "B00A8MGIZG", "B00005JM5E", "B002LMV7R0", "B00004Z4WR", "B000K2UGXO", "B00005JMYC", "B001MVYUQG", "B00005JLWN", "B000056PMU", "B0000AOV4I", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00441GYXS", "B001F12J0C", "B00ES28X3C", "B002ZG980U", "B001VLBDD0", "B00008K76U", "B001TK80C0", "B008JFURII", "B000VWYJ86", "0792159659", "B00AEFYGBA", "B0009MDPYM", "B00177YA1K", "B00005N5S5", "B0043X1FM2", "B0002J58HO", "B00005JM5B", "B00AZMFJYA", "B003AWRMBA", "074349346X", "B003VA3JUO", "0783240295", "6305767866", "B0000844I8", "B000065U1N", "B002GHHHKQ", "B000K7VHQE", "B0000AXE8I", "0800177258", "B000ASDFGI", "B003Q6D2B4", "B000HRMAPE", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JMOW", "B00GPWEPZ8", "0312944926", "B000VI70QS", "B000KF0GWW"], "bought_together": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00005JN5E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00I563DSC", "B0013BM63O", "1400079152"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7555}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.5, "brand": "DaVinci", "asin": "B00005JOC9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SLBDLMtIL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Da Vinci Code (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)"}

{"description": "Edith Piaf is the subject ofLa Vie en Rose, director Olivier Dahan's powerful if emotionally redundant biographical film about the iconic French superstar whose life, as depicted here, seems to have been a numbing succession of tragedies interrupted on occasion by artistic triumph. Dahan's portrait begins with Piaf's stay in a brothel as a young girl. Left to the care of her grandmother (who runs the place) after her father pulls her away from a narcissistic mother, Piaf undergoes significant health problems and grows up to sing on the street in lieu of outright prostitution. The film pulses along with the usual biopic rhythms, with pivotal moments in the life of Piaf (played as an adult by Marion Cotillard) turning up regularly only to be smacked aside by the unseen hand of perpetual misfortune. There's the impresario (Gerard Depardieu) who recognizes Piaf's great but raw talent only to have a run-in with the criminal element around her. There's the heavyweight fighter (Marcel Cerdan) who becomes the love of Piaf's life but can't be with her. Drug addiction, random car accidents, tax problems, you name it, it's all here, topped by an unnerving revelation that pops up inLa Vie en Rose's final moments. After awhile, with such a concentration of bad news squeezed into 140 minutes, one begins to wish Dahan had taken a more expansive approach to Piaf's life and times. But the film is never less than interesting, and the lead performance by Cotillard is often astonishing.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002LE8MGW", "B004SEUIXS", "B000UVV26A", "B001CIOCLC", "B000002UYD", "B002VKB0M4", "B000YPUFBA", "B002AG2NTI", "B0007Z0NYQ", "B0087IT8FK", "B000MEYIBG", "B0009P7EI2", "B004WDZR0O", "B00279MJHE", "0307268012", "B0069UV0AY", "B001THZAAI", "B005MYEQ4U", "B000002TMF", "B000LXH10I", "B00421IR5I", "B0000C9JFO", "B007I1Q59E", "B00AZNEVNE", "B000I6BJ56", "B000811672", "B00007J5VT", "B008H1Q3QY", "B0002S64SM", "B003L20III", "B00782O7IY", "1613743920", "B005V4X8PO", "B0007A61K6", "B0030MD5TS", "B0019UGYAU", "B0000YEENU", "B0084O26SI", "B004B3254Q", "B0001Y4JO8", "B004ZBFRRG", "B006KDHJMS", "B00A92MEJY", "B000UAE7MM", "B009CSVQ8Q", "B000SAAT76", "B00008979K", "B000CSUNRU", "B000YAA68W", "B004SIP6BI", "B0041KKYF6", "B002QQ8HAG", "B00005JM48", "B00007L4I6", "B000934FC2", "B005CKW8BM", "B004YCKKIM", "B002ONC9NC", "B001AZJKKK", "B0012EI8ES", "B009B8YMB0", "B000053VBN", "B0002V7TI8", "B004UXUUDA", "B008CJ0JS4", "B001DZA3W6", "B0031REQKE", "B000LXHK2C", "B005HISOJ4", "B000B58DHQ", "B000296E7W", "0792833279", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B005CU5OF4", "B0000A1HQP", "B00ENMZK1A", "B00166UFTS", "B000053VBP", "B00CDV4PPK", "B00005AUK9", "B004XVMCMG", "B00005NC66", "B00008G7UF", "B0031SU2Y2", "B00000AVEO", "B000M06KJ8", "B00ANQHR7U", "B004NWPY3E", "B001C71IEM", "B006OB3JVQ", "B00G15MDI0", "B001KVZ6AM", "B0036TGSJE", "B001O549EI", "B0045NXMJE", "B000SSQ7JC", "B004ZG5EYC", "B00000K3TS"], "bought_together": ["B002LE8MGW", "B001CIOCLC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005MYEQ4U", "B002LE8MGW", "B004SEUIXS", "B000UVV26A"]}, "price": 11.14, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9014}, "asin": "B00005JPX8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ylggkac7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "La Vie en Rose (Extended Version)"}

{"description": "The 14-minute featurette \"Behind the Book: The Themes ofBridge to Terabithia\" discusses such topics as friendship and family as presented in both the book and the movie through interviews with the young lead actors, the book's author, Katherine Paterson, and several librarians and school teachers. Paterson and her son, producer-screenwriter David Paterson, also recall how an actual incident in David's life inspired the book. A six-minute visual-effects featurette looks at the film's creatures from sketch to computer design to screen, including how the features of the school kids helped shape the creatures. Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb, \"chaperoned\" by producer Lauren Levine, recount their experiences on one commentary track, while the second, by director Gabor Csupo, writer Jeff Stockwell, and producer Hal Lieberman, is drier but informative. Topics covered include praise for young Bailee Madison, how Zooey Deschanel wouldn't have been considered a predator back in the '70s, and the somewhat-controversial marketing campaign that focused heavily on the film's fantasy elements. Also included is Robb's music video for \"Keep Your Eyes Wide Open.\"--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB8KQ", "B00009XUM5", "B0009NZ2KG", "0060734019", "B00005JLOT", "B001NPD9JA", "B001APZMJS", "B0016Q2D5M", "B00AEFYIQ8", "B000E8M0VA", "B000Q66FB6", "B00005JPH2", "B000DBHX4M", "B0012IWO0I", "B0000VCZKW", "B00139W3NE", "B007R6DJP8", "B00005JG6M", "B000E6ES9E", "0064401847", "B003TNS3HC", "B001LPWGBO", "1557344019", "B00HR34TBE", "B004M1A21K", "B00005JMCW", "B007IU8YY4", "B00437IEI6", "B000GB5MH4", "B00ECW9U6M", "B00979KQFO", "B00BIYQPJC", "B000AM4P9A", "B0002S64VO", "B000J10FLY", "B00128VA76", "B000T9D6FS", "B003NHRIVQ", "1557344086", "B002GIBVV6", "B0050VDN76", "B000QUU7KW", "6305865612", "B000031EGV", "B0087F7VSY", "B000FFJYB6", "B000065V42", "B0009I7NGM", "B00AEBBA2M", "B002NZK5SW", "B000P0J09W", "B00AEFY8FO", "B0000633U5", "B0021L8URG", "B000AP04GK", "B000ION23A", "B002935GMS", "B004AKCME8", "B000G1R394", "1557344159", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00005TPMM", "0440414806", "B004SIP75S", "B0009JE57G", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B004NTDF5Q", "B003RHZ6IE", "B00005JNY3", "B0000YTP02", "B00005JMFH", "B003L4Y5BW", "B004A8ZX3C", "B001GC9VK6", "B00005RRG7", "B004SIPA9Q", "B000056T4I", "B001GCUO7A", "6305428042", "B008JFUS5A", "0312369816", "B001DDBD5E", "B000F2BNW2", "B000BJ7BCK", "B0001A79EO", "B001OQCV1K", "B005F96UJ6", "B0006J28MI", "0385736061", "B004QL7K16", "B0000AM6IY", "B0000AC8LI", "B0001I562I", "B003ZHR6TS", "B000NA28I4", "B00005JPO4"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBB8KQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBB8KQ", "B000E8M0VA", "0060734019", "B00005JPH2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 83708}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JPL5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VaImU5H0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bridge to Terabithia (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Nearly 20 years after riding his last Crusade, Harrison Ford makes a welcome return as archaeologist/relic hunter Indiana Jones inIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, an action-packed fourth installment that's, in a nutshell, less memorable than the first three but great nostalgia for fans of the series. Producer George Lucas and screenwriter David Koepp (War of the Worlds) set the film during the cold war, as the Soviets--replacing Nazis as Indy's villains of choice and led by a sword-wielding Cate Blanchett with black bob and sunglasses--are in pursuit of a crystal skull, which has mystical powers related to a city of gold. After escaping from them in a spectacular opening action sequence, Indy is coerced to head to Peru at the behest of a young greaser (Shia LaBeouf) whose friend--and Indy's colleague--Professor Oxley (John Hurt) has been captured for his knowledge of the skull's whereabouts. Whatever secrets the skull holds are tertiary; its reveal is the weakest part of the movie, as the CGI effects that inevitably accompany it feel jarring next to the boulder-rolling world of Indy audiences knew and loved. There's plenty of comedy, delightful stunts--ants play a deadly role here--and the return ofRaiderslove interest Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood, once shrill but now softened, giving her ex-love bemused glances and eye-rolls as he huffs his way to save the day. Which brings us to Ford: bullwhip still in hand, he's a little creakier, a lot grayer, but still twice the action hero of anyone in film today. With all the anticipation and hype leading up to the film's release, perhaps no reunion is sweeter than that of Ford with the role that fits him as snugly as that fedora hat.--Ellen A.

{"description": "\"I bought a car. Turned out to be an alien robot. Who knew?\" deadpans Sam Witwicky, hero and human heart of Michael Bay's rollicking robot-smackdown fest,Transformers. Witwicky (the sweetly nerdy Shia LaBeouf, channeling a young John Cusack) is the perfect counterpoint to the nearly nonstop exhilarating action. The plot is simple: an alien civil war (the Autobots vs. the evil Decepticons) has spilled onto Earth, and young Sam is caught in the fray by his newly purchased souped-up Camaro. Which has a mind--and identity, as a noble-warrior robot named Bumblebee--of its own. The effects, especially the mind-blowing transformations of the robots into their earthly forms and back again, are stellar.Fans of the earlier film and TV series will be thrilled at this cutting-edge incarnation, but this version should please all fans of high-adrenaline action. Director Bay gleefully salts the movie with homages to pop-culture touchstones likeRaiders of the Lost Ark,King Kong, and the early technothrillerWarGames. The actors, though clearly all supporting those kickass robots, are uniformly on-target, including the dashing Josh Duhamel as a U.S. Army sergeant fighting an enemy he never anticipated; Jon Voight, as a tough yet sympathetic Secretary of Defense in over his head; and John Turturro, whose special agent manages to be confidently unctuous, even stripped to his undies. But the film belongs to Bumblebee, Optimus Prime, and the dastardly Megatron--and the wicked stunts they collide in all over the globe. Long live Transformers! --A.T. HurleyOn the DVDThe special edition ofTransformersis packed with extras (and more than a few product placements for Hasbro). The entire second disc is devoted to featurettes on aspects of making the technical tour-de-force--and the land mines involved in tinkering with a beloved '80s franchise. Executive producer Steven Spielberg is very much a part of the proceedings, from his introductory comments (\"I think everybody likes the idea of taking something you're familiar with and turning it into something you're not so familiar with--like an 18-wheeler become Optimus Prime\") to mentions of his films that influenced this one, likeE.T.andClose Encounters of the Third Kind.Director Michael Bay is brash and entertaining as he talks about his initial reluctance to take on the project, his indoctrination at \"Transformers U\" at Hasbro, and his enthusiasm for guerrilla-style action filmmaking. Star Shia LaBoeuf says, \"He is the sickest action director\" out there, and there's plenty of evidence here to support that. Other great highlights include features on how key scenes were shot, including the heart-pounding desert battle and the shootout in the streets of downtown L.A.--adrenaline-pumping stuff, even without the Transformers CGI'd in. --A.T.

{"description": "Marriage is a huge step in any relationship and, with the divorce rate skyrocketing, some clergymen find it advisable to council prospective couples prior to the marriage ceremony. Reverend Frank (Robin Williams) takes his marriage preparation course to a whole new level, putting couples through a very unusual and grueling set of classes that cover everything from trust and communication to experiencing childbirth, meeting each other's needs in and out of bed, and group sessions on how to fight fairly. Happy couple Sadie Jones's (Mandy Moore) and Ben Murphy's (John Krasinski) perfect compatibility is tested to the limits with extraordinary (and hysterical) assignments like caring for twin baby robots that cry and poop without restraint while baby-sitting a friend's two young children and shopping for wedding china. Driving a car blindfolded while one's intended gives directions is no simple task either, but abstinence from sex and writing their own marriage vows may be the couple's most difficult homework assignments. Comedy reigns throughout the entire movie thanks to Robin Williams, his choir-boy assistant Josh Flitter (Nancy Drew) and the rest of the cast and laughing out loud is definitely a course requirement for viewers, but underneath the hilarity is a serious message about making marriage work.--Tami HoriuchiDVD featuresIncludes widescreen anamorphic and full-screen versionsAdditional scenes with optional director commentaryAsk Choir Boy: Choose which relationship/marital questions he answers", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00561BNI6", "B000OCZA04", "B000P0J08S", "B00104AYFQ", "B0000CDRVU", "B001TUZD8O", "B00005JN3W", "B000A343RI", "B00008WJD6", "B0015I2RT8", "B0034GK78W", "B002ZG989G", "B00003CXSM", "B001AKTZW8", "B003B3V0N4", "6304584210", "B004EPZ070", "B001BL96JI", "B00AEBB8NS", "B001OQCUZM", "B002ZG9968", "B000LC5B7O", "B00005JPSM", "B000Y7U93C", "B00005JG6N", "B001Y8DJVE", "B008R65XWO", "B003EYVXXC", "B000BKVQS4", "B0009OL7Z4", "B00AEBB9M8", "B000ELJAEM", "B002K0WBXW", "B000ICM5X0", "B000GB775E", "B000RETOGA", "B00005JN4H", "B00006FMUW", "B00386EZKE", "B002ZG97QK", "B00AEFY99O", "B0049TC88U", "B003Y5H524", "B0000DZ6N3", "B000MEYJHE", "B0021L8UOY", "B000E6EHE0", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00007976U", "B00AEFXWXI", "B00008VFCA", "B00005JN0Z", "B0038N9WKU", "B002SYAGNC", "B00007E2F5", "B00DMDE02Q", "B002ZG984Q", "B0015U0QVW", "B0012KJ0DK", "B004IK30PA", "B000YAA68C", "B0002OXRSG", "B002ZG97B0", "B0002I84N0", "B0007RT9M6", "B004SIP9X8", "B000099T4E", "B00006ZXSL", "B001CTA1UM", "B001C5LLQ4", "B000HCPS94", "B00164KYV4", "B000P0J0DS", "B004SIP7I0", "B00005JMXX", "B002ZG998G", "B0000897EG", "B000J4QW7W", "B00466HN7M", "B00AEBB8R4", "B003Y5H4ZW", "B002ZG98FU", "B005LAIIB2", "B000957O82", "B003UEYBPI", "B000EMGICS", "B00AEFYWQY", "B00029LO5E", "B002ZGW92E", "B0026BXHQ0", "B000VKL6T8", "B00HW3EZZE", "B005LAIGSM", "B000LC4Z8A", "B0010X5X4O", "B002ZG99UE", "B000E8N8H0", "B002U4UYZA", "B001HN69C2", "B004HO6I2E"], "bought_together": ["B000OCZA04"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0034GK78W", "B002ZG989G", "B00561BNI6", "B001Y8DJVE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 56082}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JPQE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-wgdGowCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "License to Wed"}

{"description": "The Dark Knightarrives with tremendous hype (best superhero movie ever? posthumous Oscar for Heath Ledger?), and incredibly, it lives up to all of it.  But calling it the best superhero movie ever seems like faint praise, since part of what makes the movie great--in addition to pitch-perfect casting, outstanding writing, and a compelling vision--is that it bypasses the normal fantasy element of the superhero genre and makes it all terrifyingly real.  Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is Gotham City's new district attorney, charged with cleaning up the crime rings that have paralyzed the city. He enters an uneasy alliance with the young police lieutenant, Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), and Batman (Christian Bale), the caped vigilante who seems to trust only Gordon--and whom only Gordon seems to trust. They make progress until a psychotic and deadly new player enters the game: the Joker (Heath Ledger), who offers the crime bosses a solution--kill the Batman. Further complicating matters is that Dent is now dating Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, after Katie Holmes turned down the chance to reprise her role), the longtime love of Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne.In his last completed role before his tragic death, Ledger is fantastic as the Joker, a volcanic, truly frightening force of evil. And he sets the tone of the movie: the world is a dark, dangerous place where there are no easy choices.  Eckhart and Oldman also shine, but as good as Bale is, his character turns out rather bland in comparison (not uncommon for heroes facing more colorful villains). Director-cowriter Christopher Nolan (Memento) follows his critically acclaimedBatman Beginswith an even better sequel that sets itself apart from notable superhero movies likeSpider-Man 2andIron Manbecause of its sheer emotional impact and striking sense of realism--there are no suspension-of-disbelief superpowers here. At 152 minutes, it's a shade too long, and it's much too intense for kids. But for most movie fans--and not just superhero fans--The Dark Knightis a film for the ages.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B000PC6A3E", "B002ZG981E", "B00G4RD4PQ", "B0039208QM", "B001GMALGY", "B00E2Y0YBK", "B00C2IGQBA", "B0039208JE", "B00H14WTLQ", "B0039208CG", "B0085D3I3K", "B0039208C6", "B000M5AJQI", "B00319ECGK", "B001FB55H6", "B00EIG5M5A", "7020070078", "B00E2Y6AUY", "B00D5FMGGS", "B001OQCV6K", "B0013FBS20", "B000Q6GX5Y", "B001GKJ2FC", "B00FPS79F6", "B001992NUQ", "B004JMSIRC", "B001RIY4WE", "B00DYEN6XC", "B008QZ5PY2", "B001F7MSG6", "B00FAHYNWE", "B00J7PRJXU", "B001AQT0Z4", "B001UV4XEW", "B0083SBJXS", "B00AEFY552", "B00C8RD79O", "B007KAJG3K", "B007L4HET8", "B004EPZ07U", "B007L4HFDI", "B00AEFXKOO", "B000PC0U1W", "B00C6B8TB8", "B00HINFI4K", "B003TT2X6I", "B001KZIRM2", "B002ZG99NG", "B00EZ4M68G", "B004SIP90G", "B003ZHR6RK", "B001GCUO16", "B003TT2X6S", "B00JNEWSLS", "B001F3FUK6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B002ZG981E", "B000PC6A3E"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPY0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pGxSkkz4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Dark Knight [Theatrical Release]"}

{"description": "Directors Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky return to the scene  of the crime with this urgent follow-up to their harrowing 1996  documentary,Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood  Hills. That profoundly disturbing film chronicles the tragic and  twisted case of three young men--Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin, and  Jessie Misskelley--who were convicted of the brutal 1993 murders of  three second graders. The film suggests that perhaps their only crime  was dressing in black and liking Metallica. To the townspeople, this  smacked of Satanism and marked them as made-to-order suspects.  Meanwhile, Mark Byars, the stepfather of one of the victims emerged  from the film as a \"Why-isn't-anyone-following-up-on-this?\" suspect.Revelations, which, for those who missed the first film,  efficiently recaps the case, and charts the trio's maddening appeals  process (police browbeat a confession out of Misskelley, who has an IQ  of 71, after 12 hours of questioning), as well as the efforts of a  group of Internet advocates to \"Free the West Memphis Three.\" Byers is  back as well, and he is infinitely more terrifying than anything inBook of Shadows, Berlinger'sBlair Witchsequel. We learn  that Byers had all his teeth extracted in the years after the murders  (human bite marks are among the new evidence introduced). We also learn  that his wife has since died of undetermined causes. When Byers passes  a suspect lie detector test, he exults, \"I knew I was innocent.\" A  further mystery is why bothParadise Lostfilms have not  garnered the media attention or sparked the outrage that attended Errol  Morris'sThe Thin Blue Line, which led to the release of an  innocent man who was imprisoned for more than 10 years.

{"description": "In season four,The X-Filescontinued to expand the  breadth and complexity of the mythology established in the previous two  seasons while developing a deeper, romantically ambiguous relationship  between its photogenic leads, FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder (David  Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). New players such as  United Nations official Marita Covarrubias and virus-carrying bees  joined familiar faces like Cigarette Smoking Man, Alex Krycek, the  blockheaded Alien Bounty Hunters, and the Consortium in the growing  cast of a global struggle involving multiple factions of alien forces.  It was a season in which Mulder and Scully seemed to lose ground to the  global forces surrounding them, in which Mulder was infected with the  black oil and Scully discovered she had cancer. With even the loyalties  of Assistant Director Skinner and Mulder's mother in doubt, Mulder and  Scully learned to trust only each other in their pursuit of the  truth.The show also continued to take breaks from the dizzying, heavy  mythology to serve up standalone episodes with the show's unusual blend  of sophisticated humor and creepy paranormal explorations. In \"Musings  of a Cigarette Smoking Man,\" the show parodied the scope of the  public's conspiracy paranoia, implying that Cigarette Smoking Man was  involved in everything from JFK's assassination to the Buffalo Bills'  four straight losses in the Super Bowl. The three previous seasons had  not exhausted the list of popular paranormal phenomena to tackle, and  season four covered a wide range of topics from invisibility  (\"Unrequited\"), past lives (\"The Field Where I Died\"), and inbreeding  (\"Home\") to shape-shifting (\"Small Potatoes\") and golems (\"Kaddish\").The X-Filesproved, again, to be that rare science-fiction show  that could both frighten and touch its audience, telling intelligent  stories that resonated with the skeptic in each of us, all the while  sprinkling in a few laughs.--Eugene Wei", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000CNE0T2", "B000BOH990", "B000CNE0TC", "B000EXDS34", "B000BOH98G", "B000EXDS3E", "B000EXDS3Y", "B000BOH986", "B0007X7044", "B001G7PSZI", "B001FACH7S", "B0006UEVUE", "B001CY5N00", "B003V1IU3O", "B001G7PT4I", "0061686174", "B000244E2O", "B00465I156", "B00133QNSG", "0061053309", "B0002NY8R6", "1933784725", "B00005JA9M", "B00FXW9664", "B0009X76XW", "B000SULWKO", "B000FFJYC0", "B000E1MXWS", "B000NOKFH6", "B001G0MFIS", "B001A9ZRLC", "B001DPHDBU", "B000063V8R", "B00005Y1NF", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B000667HBS", "B00FWMVVI6", "B00FWMVVHC", "B000R7I44K", "B003K2G0TA", "B004TPJMRY", "B0001AVZDU", "B000ATQYWY", "B000A88EU0", "B0038M2AWI", "B002VA5A02", "B001CQONKY", "B0081QF6Q8", "B00008KA59", "B00GX7D5JW", "B001992NWO", "B003L77H1E", "B000FOPPBA", "B000U1ZV1W", "B000CQM4YM", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B00BTFK01Y", "B000UX6TIE", "B00IWTVDUW", "B000B8I9ZO", "B00FWMVVKY", "B002BAW6GS", "B003R0MF1W", "B000F8O2PQ", "B001VPJYZ0", "B00AJXO4FA", "B003BE2KBO", "B0018CWEYY", "B000FIMG68", "B0085KGGTQ", "B00HUPC5X8", "B008LCRA98", "B003L77GWE", "B00JF5GAZA", "B002WC89WK", "B0007CNY4K", "B00IQ8TT82", "B00080ZG2E", "B000XJD3K2", "B0002DB5N6", "B0019LY5IM", "B000I0QLR8", "B003TNW030", "B000H7JCGY", "B006BZ8NSE", "B00BM2JVAA", "B0006UEVTK", "B0002WZTCA", "B000A6CLKQ", "B000KGH00W", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00IYMSMTM", "B0002NY8GW", "B00J5JSV1W", "B00005JNOG", "B00CRX82LM", "B00K0MM4AM", "B000X5SPBI", "B000OHBCI8", "B000ICLRKC"], "bought_together": ["B000BOH990", "B000CNE0T2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BOH990", "B000BOH986", "B000BOH98G", "B000CNE0T2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 200096}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 66.47, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005NC6H", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PSBVDYPVL._SX300_.jpg", "title": "The X-Files - The Complete Fourth Season"}

But when misdeeds from Zelig's multiple-personality past start to surface (larceny, bigamy and an unauthorized appendectomy), the human chameleon is on the run again, and Eudora must search the world over to find and save the only man who's every man she's ever wanted!", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFYVUQ", "B00005AUJK", "B00005O06L", "B00005O06M", "0792846125", "B00005O06I", "0792846117", "B00005O06K", "B00005O06J", "0767819764", "B00005AUJO", "0792846087", "B00013D580", "B00005AUJH", "6304907729", "0792846060", "B00008L3SA", "B00020X88E", "B00003CXGS", "0792846095", "B00008978N", "B000AM6P2U", "B00005AUJI", "B00003CY6A", "B00004STRD", "B000IU37SO", "B002LMV7RA", "0393325822", "0156717204", "B00005JL81", "B0013D8LC2", "B0064NTZKI", "B007NYZA0Q", "B000087F6L", "B005MYEQ4U", "B00005AUJM", "B001DJ7PR8", "B00009Q4W7", "0307269647", "B009UTX4M8", "B009UTX53Q", "B006FSRSFQ", "0307389979", "B00G7QPXUI", "B001IHJ988", "B00G7QPYX4", "B00H96KG2U", "B00006RCNV", "B001BEK8E2", "B00079Z9VO", "B00005QAPH", "0393051676", "B001WLMOL4", "B00E5N8SFC", "B004ULEEQG", "B00A01CQIS", "B000055Y0X", "B0002MHE1O", "B000BMY2LU", "0810957426", "B000TXNDV6", "B00005UQ7T", "B0087ZG7R0", "B000244EWY", "B000093NQZ", "B0049985XW", "B001D8W7EK", "B00005AUJE", "B00GJNQ3I0", "B0050FXDDQ", "B000UJ48SQ", "B001G9F9IW", "B000CNE08S"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFYVUQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005O06M", "B00AEFYVUQ", "0792846117", "B00005AUJK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 36675}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.42, "brand": "MGM", "asin": "B00005O06N", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41AFRGT4F7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Zelig"}
{"description": "Screen greats Robert Mitchum, Peter Falk, and Arthur Kennedy star in the riveting war drama ANZIO, a vivid portrait of one of the bloodiest WWII battles ever fought. After landing with allied troops at Anzio, Italy in 1944, war correspondent Dick Ennis (Mitchum) and buddy Corporal Rabinoff (Falk) tell Anzio commander General Lesley (Kennedy) that the road to Rome is wide open. But instead of heading to Rome, Lesley attempts to build a coastal stronghold, only to discover that the Germans have outflanked them by enclosing the Anzio beachhead. Four months and over 30,000 casualities later, the Allied forces smash through the German lines and victoriously march to Rome. Directed by highly-acclaimed action director Edward Dmytryk (The Caine Mutiny, Back to Bataan), ANZIO is a powerful film and a symbol of heroic tenacity.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0015S2OWI", "B00096S4B2", "B00096S4BM", "B00005PJ8K", "0792843576", "B0007TKNLU", "0792841662", "B00005ASGB", "B00008AOTO", "B0029778T8", "B0007TKNGA", "B000062XEX", "B000MGBLIC", "B000E5N6KW", "B000NTPG66", "B0001NBMGC", "B0001NBMHQ", "B000A2WJBQ", "B00005N5S3", "B0001NBMH6", "B0001WTWWE", "B00143XE0U", "B000NO1XJA", "B00AEFYBA6", "B000NTPG6Q", "B00008AOTR", "B004GSVXBW", "B0002V8OAK", "B00005B1YF", "B000EHSVSC", "B00005PJ8L", "B00AEFXLKC", "B000EMGJFE", "B00008MTY1", "B0005C9MQ6", "B00CHYSSME", "B00005B1YH", "B00005JN9P", "B000MGTQ7U", "0792844017", "B000O78L0U", "0792841670", "B00008DDGW", "B005DTZXPA", "B005DTZXL4", "B004VGHF7K", "B00005PJ8S", "B00008R9M6", "B00005R23T", "B00005QCVP", "B008A1TWXC", "B004IFYMXE", "B00008PC0Y", "B000H1RFSM", "B0001NBMI0", "B0000639EI", "B00HZOXRCC", "B000TLTCPO", "B000EHSVS2", "B003AWRMCO", "B000E0WJN2", "B00005JP3T", "B004176JJY", "B000O599Z8", "B0001FVDIC", "B004IFYMXO", "B000066C6H", "B004R6EF9U", "B004R6EFAO", "B000063URX", "B000O599N0", "B00004XPPC", "B000CNESN0", "B0001GF2GU", "B000U1ZV6M", "B005HQBO9I", "0782010040", "B004U7EIES", "B001PO55LE", "B000MRA542", "B00BTYU3UI", "B000HT38BW", "B000O599YO", "B00C2535TE", "B005DIA0IQ", "B00005N5S2", "B0008ENHU8", "B00BFWKE62", "B00AEFXFW6", "B000O599VC", "B002DNLT1Q", "B003B3NV5E", "B003ASLJPE", "B004TPJN3C", "B0014CCPP6"], "bought_together": ["B0007TKNGA", "B00005N5S3"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFYBA6", "B0007TKNGA", "B00096S4B2", "B00005PJ8S"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18879}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.99, "brand": "MITCHUM,ROBERT", "asin": "B00005OSJQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51f4cAGG8DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Anzio"}

{"description": "Like the TV incarnation ofThe Odd Couple, theM*A*S*Hseries has supplanted the original film in the public's consciousness. Legendary comedy writer Larry Gelbart (Your Show of Shows) deserves a medal for developing Robert Altman's bloody, funny 1970 classic for television with much of its anti-establishment spirit intact. These 24 first-season episodes--bracingly less politically correct than the shows in the final seasons--chart the program's sometimes bumpy evolution as it tried to remain true to the film's anarchic spirit while finding its own voice. The most memorable episodes include \"The Pilot,\" which establishes the characters in broad strokes; \"Sometimes You Hear the Bullet,\" in which a friend of Hawkeye's (Alan Alda) dies on the operating table (look for \"Ronny\" Howard as an underage soldier); \"Cowboy,\" in which someone is trying to kill clueless commander Henry Blake (McLean Stevenson); and the pivotal \"Dear Dad,\" the first of what would be a series of multistory episodes in which Hawkeye writes to his father about life at the 4077th. It is interesting to note film characters who made early exits from the series, including Timothy Brown's Spearchucker and Karen Philipp's Lt. Dish (George Morgan, who plays Father Mulcahy in the pilot, we hardly knew ye). Klinger (Jamie Farr), bucking for his Section 8 discharge, doesn't appear until the fifth episode, \"Chief Surgeon Who?\" And Gary Burghoff's Radar is a much more wily and savvy partner in crime to \"Yankee Doodle Doctors\" Hawkeye and Trapper John (Wayne Rogers) than in later seasons. In its 11-year run,M*A*S*Hearned 14 Emmy Awards, and it remains one of TV's most beloved series. Though it is a staple of syndication, the episodes are presented here uncut, probably for the first time since their original broadcast. ForM*A*S*Hdevotees, this three-disc set is just what the doctor ordered.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001DMVZJO", "B001DMVZJY", "B001DMVZKI", "B001DMVZL2", "B001DMVZLW", "B001DMVZLM", "B001DMVZM6", "B001DMVZN0", "B001DMVZNA", "B001DMVZNK", "B0001ZJ1HW", "B00008YGS0", "B00008NV4G", "B000OT6V1E", "B00BMJ7ZKG", "B000HT3P5G", "B002E58FT2", "B0007KIFK0", "B0002NY8R6", "B000B837XS", "B0024HH32A", "B000291Q3Y", "B0006N2EZK", "B00008EY6N", "B000NJMJHA", "B0002NY8PI", "B000068V9Y", "B000A6T1J0", "B0000E32X2", "B00005JMHI", "B000NOIX7K", "B00005JLIC", "B000291Q3O", "B003JV0ITA", "B000EWBNMI", "B0050MB5AC", "B000MXPE6U", "B000CCBCK8", "B0001NBNIY", "B000FSME1K", "B000IHYXIK", "B0007Y08P6", "B001OXLGK0", "B000LV6W00", "B00A2L1CJK", "B00009VRF0", "B000068V9X", "B00HVFA36I", "0688149553", "B00GOC75YW", "B000E3L7EQ", "B0000ZMH8S", "B000YKYT1M", "B000HT3P5Q", "B0000DC3VM", "B00008R9MC", "B000H7JCHS", "B000YGGNGK", "B0085Z6ZD8", "B0000DFZ5O", "B0012EBV8I", "B0006BAWSI", "B001E6JC26", "B000VDDDY6", "B000BOH986", "B000EOTTS6", "B000NTMA1U", "B00GHH9HUE", "B0012EBV88", "B008KZX7W0", "B000A0GXGK", "B0087GKHXO", "B0002W4SX6", "B000UX6TKM", "B0009UC7MK", "B0007LXP86", "B000MGBSH6", "B000N6UF10", "B0002W4SWW", "B000EQ46HI", "B0009OUBPQ", "B0002I837M", "B00JHH1VUU", "B0006N2EZA", "B00361XWEQ", "B000NOIX66", "B00005JLEX", "B000UX6TJI", "B002C2KAS6", "B000BGR1B4", "B0001ZMWXW", "B000HWZ4HU", "B000BNTM46", "B00HRUQA6O", "B0007US79Y", "B005IQGNHK", "B009OE2O7A", "B002L9N4O2", "B000F9T70A"], "bought_together": ["B001DMVZJO", "B001DMVZJY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BMJ7ZKG", "B001DMVZJO", "B001DMVZJY", "B000HT3P5Q"]}, "price": 32.88, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 79655}, "asin": "B00005QVVC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516996K0KCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "M*A*S*H - Season One (Collector's Edition)"}

{"description": "Egyptologist and general mess Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) discovers a map to the lost city of Hamunaptra, and so she hires rogue Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) to lead her there. Once there, Evelyn accidentally unlocks the tomb of Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), a man who had been buried alive a couple of millennia ago with flesh-eating bugs as punishment for sleeping with the pharaoh's girlfriend. The ancient mummy is revived, and he is determined to bring his old love back to life, which of course means much mayhem (including the unleashing of the 10 plagues) and human sacrifice. Despite the rather gory premise, this movie is fairly tame in terms of violence; most of the magic and surprise come from the special effects, which are glorious to watch, although Imhotep, before being fully reconstituted, is, as one explorer puts it, rather \"juicy.\"", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001HQZJMU", "B00003CXC5", "B00005JKYX", "B002ZG98UA", "B004SIP9Z6", "B000H30B2C", "B001DTPZNY", "B00AEFY5B6", "B000I0RQVI", "B009MO57H6", "B000U7WV1Y", "B001DJLD1M", "B0009RCPY8", "B001ILFUDC", "B000EQ5TSS"], "bought_together": ["B001HQZJMU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B006VRRGNK", "B000ASATYY", "B00003CXTA", "B00000JQB5"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 327919}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 39.95, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005Y6ZR", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RQGKVASYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Mummy Collection - The Mummy / The Mummy Returns (Full Screen Edition)"}

{"description": "Retelling a story that has made it onto the silver screen more than most, this latest adaptation of The Count of Monte Cristo makes yet another swashbuckling attempt to win over a new generation of cinema goers. A dashing James Caviezel takes the role of the Count, who is driven by a desire for revenge after being betrayed by his best friend Fernand (played by a dishevelled Guy Pearce) and landed with 16 years of solitary confinement in Chateau D'If, a damp cavernous prison. Thus the scene is set for a good old-fashioned romp. The trouble with this \"re-imagining\" (to borrow a phrase from Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes) is that it's never quite sure whether to take itself seriously or not. Alexandre Dumas's original story is a traditionally melodramatic tale of deceit and double-crossing, with clear-cut bad guys and a moral lesson to be learned at the end. Here, director Kevin Reynolds appears unsure about whether to stick with tradition or bring the story up to date and turn it into a post-modern play on the old Victorian values and style. When the Count and his heavy-breathing loved one are reunited, their kiss is actually framed as a cameo. Both lead actors are also prone to heavy bouts of overacting, garnishing their performances with exaggerated baroque gestures. Clearly this is a film in which the actors could over-indulge themselves and (almost) get away with it, were it not for the fact that--bar Richard Harris as the \"Priest\"--none of them seem to have the faintest idea about how to conduct themselves in a period drama. This Count of Monte Cristo will leave the audience a little confused as to whether they should cry along with the story or laugh along with the actors. --Nikki Disney On the DVD: The Count of Monte Cristo on disc offers no escape from the dry drawl of director Kevin Reynolds, who features in almost every element of the extensive extras package. With a shy studio disclaimer before his commentary, he's got a refreshingly frank attitude to", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792839137", "6305428077", "B001EAWMGA", "B000U34PM6", "B000CEXGAU", "B00DCRE87O", "B000ARXF96", "B00004YA66", "B0002HOEPI", "B000BFJM26", "B002U0KHNS", "B00BC0JGUW", "B00005NRO0", "B0064MT1L2", "B000A50442", "B000HC2LZS", "1411469488", "B002AK9URM", "076781505X", "0140449264", "B0007N19X2", "B002VWNID6", "0800141601", "B00062IVOY", "0822003260", "B0002235R6", "B000ENC5YW", "B000P0J0EW", "B00006ZXSO", "B000056PMU", "9626340398", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B000056VP4", "B00CHMBQM0", "B005S9EK5Y", "B001ECDVJU", "B000NVT0SO", "B0001NBMEE", "B00006L949", "B00AEFYO5I", "B0002TSZI8", "B00005LOL0", "B0002YLCG0", "B004SIP75S", "B00081U7HC", "B00004TJJV", "0553213504", "B004SIP9RO", "6304765266", "6304711905", "B00096S4DK", "B0006N2EZ0", "B002K0WBXW", "B000093FLA", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00AEFZ2DG", "B00006ZXSK", "B006P0FIGU", "B002GHHHJC", "0783222149", "B00005JM5B", "B000YGDNPO", "B004IK30MI", "B00096S49Y", "B00860YICC", "6304711891", "B00006ZXSI", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00005JMOW", "B00866JL96", "B000LP6KNU", "B00005PJ8T", "B00004WG2F", "B00000G3PA", "6305428115", "6305692688", "B000E1ZBGS", "B001ECDVK4", "B00000F4ZY", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00028HBKM", "B0041SI78O", "B000BITVBA", "B00003CXFV", "B004SIP7ZS", "B001E75QH0", "6305213283", "6305416222", "B00066FB52", "B0034G4P94", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000P0J0DS", "B00DHHWXYY", "6305127646", "6305236569", "B009LDD1H6", "6305128952", "B00005ATZT", "B0074JOUHE", "6304698798"], "bought_together": ["0792839137", "6305428077"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0792839137", "0140449264", "B000CEXGAU", "B000U34PM6"]}, "price": 12.5, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 231677}, "asin": "B000063W1R", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51LYMHVq8EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Count of Monte Cristo [Region 2]"}

As the centuries-old war between humanity and the Aragami is heating up, Momiji goes to Tokyo to work with the government agency fighting the monsters. She's joined by the roguish Mamoru Kusanagi: as a child he was kidnapped by a powerful Aragami and given seven souls, ormitama(symbolized by the \"Blue Seed\" of the title). In battle Kusanagi transforms into a werewolfish version of himself with sword blades in his forearms. He's challenged by the Jim Morrison-esque Murakomo, a servant of the Aragami lords who possesses eightmitama. The plot takes an unsettling turn with the rebirth of the god of darkness, Susano-Oh, whom Murakomo tends with Momiji's twin sister, Kaede--who died in the first episode. The adventures and romance are played against an ecological message that's wrapped in right-wing rhetoric reminiscent of the ultraconservative cabal inGasaraki: contemporary Japanese culture is damned as \"barren,\" \"dead,\" and \"cannibalistic\". Although she tends to dither, Momiji never indulges in the whining and tantrums that make many other magical girls so annoying; the dashing Kusanagi assumes the role of protector-lover without losing his outlaw &#xE9;lan as Tamahome does inFushigi Yugi.

{"description": "From the studio that brought you REMEMBER THE TITANS comes an inspirational film based on a true story. Jim Morris (Dennis Quaid), father, teacher, and high school coach, thought his dream was over. He'd had his shot playing baseball, blew out his shoulder, and retired without ever making it to the big leagues. Then, in 1999, Coach Morris made a fateful bet with his perpetually losing team. If they won the district championship, Morris -- who threw a 98 mph fastball -- would try out for the majors. The team went from worst to first, and Jim, living up to his end of the bargain, threw caution to the wind and was on the road to becoming the oldest rookie in the major leagues. This heartfelt, uplifting story about not giving up on your dreams is a remarkable and affecting story that will have everyone cheering.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0068FZ0GK", "B000MNOX94", "B004X2TYG2", "B0000633U2", "B0012YYZDG", "B0007LLPXI", "B00005M20J", "B00009AOAX", "0792843592", "B000J3OTT6", "0800177258", "B00AEFXHNI", "B0010YSD90", "B000056VP4", "B00004W221", "B000069I1K", "B00028HBES", "B005SQRYEG", "B0001US66Y", "B00DW5IKW0", "B00005JPBO", "B000EXZFCQ", "B0000524E4", "B00DNF1SSC", "B000MNOX9E", "B0036APHRC", "B00AATUZLU", "B0007LLPWO", "B000FOPPDI", "B008H6GHHY", "B001KRCDT8", "B004GJYRF0", "B000FTCLRG", "B0019ESNG4", "B000CNFC76", "B00F3LSXPA", "B003VE9WTW", "B00720ONHM", "B00004TJQJ", "B0000DZTNB", "B0008JIJ2E", "B000X5RBXG", "B0002WZTOI", "6305428387", "B0006FYOTC", "B004DK5CW4", "B00008EY60", "B00009AVA4", "B001LXIDVI", "B00006SFL7", "B001BSBBF8", "B000KLQUS0", "B004J713LK", "B00BFE33SQ", "6305428352", "B00E1HIWTO", "0783225733", "B00008O38G", "B000065V42", "B00005JKVU", "B0087F7VSY", "B000068QPY", "B007TGOJLE", "B001YV504U", "B000YGGNMO", "B000P0J09W"], "bought_together": ["B0068FZ0GK", "B000MNOX94"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0068FZ0GK", "B004X2TYG2", "B000J3OTT6", "B0007LLPXI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 105793}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.5, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B000068DBE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510YP5SNYNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Rookie (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "The new short film \"Scrat's Missing Adventure: Gone Nutty\" showcases the well-timed animation--strongly influenced by Chuck Jones's Road Runner-Wile E. Coyote shorts--that made that frantic little character so effective as a comic foil. It's interesting to compare the Oscar&#xAE;-winning short \"Bunny\" withIce Age. The viewer can see the Blue Sky artists developing the more angular and less detailed look that's become the studio's signature. Like Sid the Sloth, the title character in \"Bunny\" suggests a slightly frayed walk-around figure from a theme park; the texture of her coat anticipates the old-chenille-bathrobe look of Manny the Mammoth's pelt. The clips in different languages, trailers, directors' commentary, and making-of features feel rather standard, but listening to John Leguizamo experiment with different voices before settling on the exaggerated lisp for Sid offers an unusual and funny insight into the development of an animated character.--Charles Solomon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000GUJZ00", "B001GCUNWQ", "B005LAIISA", "B000MV9026", "B004HO6I4M", "B000AY74OG", "B001DPHDCY", "B002WJI2QQ", "B0006JMLRK", "B0012EM5D8", "B0000AOX0O", "B00CWM58WY", "B005QODEEE", "B0039N74CW", "B00005JNQS", "B00003CXJ4", "0783231474", "B001ECQ75A", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B0000640SC", "B001NCDFTW", "B004EPZ034", "B000M343BC", "B000RMJ4F8", "B0042U94UQ", "B00007LVCM", "B00AFEX83C", "B0000VV4W2", "B000UVKGPI", "B00005JMQZ", "B0013FSWT2", "B00G5G7EXY", "B008JFUQ16", "B002ZG97YM", "6305161887", "B0030IIZ4M", "B00005JNS0", "B0013FSL3E", "B005SDUV4E", "B00CHVJODE", "B00EBBGLFC", "B00EV1YZ96", "B001GCUO7A", "B005LAIHW2", "B00E9ZATJO", "B000056H26", "B00029LO0Y", "B000VBJEEG", "B006JD48LO", "B00F522C7C", "B005LAIH4A", "B003H9M1Q2", "B004G600A4", "B00005JM7T", "B005F96UJ6", "B00365F6I2", "B008YWY0HK", "B0030IIYYS", "B00JK531ES", "B00947N6D8", "B001OMU6UM", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B001ILFUD2", "B00000JL8E", "B000L22SG6", "B001GCUNW6", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00009YXAW", "B004LWZW7Y", "B001HN6918", "B003ZHVJGO", "B000065V42", "B00HLTD2OE", "B00275EHJG", "B00E00OGE2", "B00003CXB4", "B001HN6922", "B001U3D88M", "B002ZG9904", "B000H7JCK0", "B000AAF1TU", "B00005JMFH", "B001LPWGFA", "B008NNY9QW", "B009PPO78W", "B000LPS2VI", "B003E66Y84", "B00157OICI", "B003UESJF6", "B00003CXG7", "B001O5LVPI", "B000EQ5UHS", "B00028HBES", "B0000VCZKW", "B000ROAK2W", "B00ALMNCLQ", "B00I6JOD2S", "B000YERP2S", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00H5NY7NG"], "bought_together": ["B004HO6I4M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004HO6I4M", "B005LAIISA", "B00IEXX4KS", "B000MV9026"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 126280}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.07, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B00006CXHU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5150B79E6SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ice Age (2-Disc Special Edition)"}
{"description": "The epic sci-fi seriesBabylon 5was a unique experiment in the history of television. It was effectively a novel for television in five seasons, consisting of 110 episodes with a clear beginning, middle, and end. The first season introduces the main characters, headed this year by Commander Jeffery Sinclair (Michael O'Hare) and Security Chief Michael Garibaldi (Jerry Doyle), and familiarizes the audience with the unique environment of a five-mile-long space station in the year 2257.The first episode, \"Midnight on the Firing Line,\" plays at a breathless pace, introducing Commander Susan Ivanova (Claudia Christian) and establishing the conflict between the Narn and Centauri races as represented by their ambassadors, G'Kar (Andreas Katsulas) and Londo Mollari (Peter Jurasik). Then follow several mediocre episodes that initially give the impression thatB5is aStar Trekclone afflicted with \"silly alien of the week\" syndrome. With \"And the Sky Full of Stars,\"B5really begins to hit its stride, Sinclair being forced to relive his mysterious experiences during the Earth-Minbari war. Filler shows such as \"TKO\" are notable only for being controversially violent, while the disappointing \"Grail\" points to writer-creator J. Michael Straczynski's fascination with Arthurian mythology. \"Signs and Portents\" introduces the sinister Mr. Morden (Ed Wasser) and offers the chilling first appearance of the Shadows, an ancient alien threat.B5hits warp speed with a run of exceptional episodes building to the season finale. The two-part \"Voice in the Wilderness\" has Mars breaking into open revolt against Earth and the discovery of a \"Great Machine\" on the dead world Epsilon 3. Referencing 1950s sci-fi classicForbidden Planet, the story leads to the superb  time-travel-based \"Babylon Squared.\" Season finale \"Chrysalis\" proves more than just the usual television cliffhanger, placing Minbari ambassador Delenn in conflict with her ruling Grey Council and forcing on her a decision that laid the groundwork forBabylon 5's eventually becoming a great love story.--Gary S.

{"description": "The third season of Joss Whedon'sBuffy the Vampire Slayerwas marked by the arrival in Sunnydale of renegade slayer Faith (Eliza Dushku), a moody loner who seemed to like her demon-staking calling just a littletoomuch. While Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) was always wary of Faith, the two developed a deep friendship and appreciative rapport--that is, until the evil mayor of Sunnydale (Harry Groener) tapped into Faith's dark side and lured her into his plot to take over the world, first as a double agent spying on Buffy, then as out-and-out nemesis. And as the mayor's ascension approached--which happened to fall on Sunnydale High's graduation day--Buffy and Faith's battles got nastier and nastier, as Buffy attempted to wrestle with her dark side (literally and figuratively), save the world and her friends, and keep her lover Angel (David Boreanaz) out of Faith's evil clutches.Chock-full of exceptional episodes, this third season started out with a bang (the superb season opener \"Anne,\" in which a runaway Buffy finally returns to her Slayer calling) and never let up. Among other highlights, the season introduced former vengeance demon and soon-to-be regular Anya (Emma Caulfield), fleshed out Angel's tortured character (and readied him for his own series), and featured a hilarious doppelganger Willow (Alyson Hannigan), a vampire from a parallel universe, who in Willow's own words was \"evil and... skanky... and kinda gay!\" (Total foreshadowing there, folks.) The season's pi&#xE8;ce de r&#xE9;sistance, though, was the two-parter \"Graduation Day,\" wherein Faith tries to kill Angel, and the students of Sunnydale High prepare to do battle with a mutated mayor and his army of demons. Aside from the series' exceptional writing and acting, this compelling year ofBuffywas anchored by the consistently excellent Gellar, as well as Dushku's complicated Faith, a girl youtrulylove to hate. By the time you finish these episodes, Faith will have cast a spell on you that you'll find very hard to shake.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVM8", "B000EHSVKK", "B000EHSVMS", "B000EHSVN2", "B000I0QLQY", "B000I0QLR8", "B000I0QLRI", "B000I0QLRS", "B000I0QLS2", "B007H9CNOI", "B0006IUE16", "B000HD1482", "B0009W5J4Q", "B000B5XOW0", "B000CCBCGM", "B000ERVJM2", "B000GG4Y6O", "B000JLTRIG", "B000OIOPHC", "B003YF9Q08", "B00344EAQO", "B0000AQS0F", "1593078226", "B00466H3CW", "B005CM1IIE", "B00005JLKB", "1595821651", "B002JVWR4U", "B00JF5G8WU", "B006LG74Q0", "B0024FAR66", "B0001JXPPC", "B00J2T1856", "B00022FWEU", "B00006J3WH", "B0009JE6FC", "B00IKM5LXG", "B00001R3O1", "B000069I1I", "B000CNE0SS", "B000BNI90Y", "B001JAHRME", "1595826106", "B00AMDA2QC", "1442412097", "1595825584", "B00005Y1NF", "159307963X", "B0012Z36F8", "B000X5SPBI", "B003L77GAQ", "B000CNE0TC", "B00133QNS6", "B000EBGFPY", "B001FB4W0C", "B002U8XW9Q", "B001QE99AQ", "B000N6SE4U", "B003R4ZMN6", "0789326302", "B000BOH986", "B009LDCXNY", "B001M5UDGS", "1442412119", "B0018RKEQY", "B000NOKFH6", "B00511N79O", "B002BWP2IK", "B000MX7V66", "B000062XFG", "B00006FD9N", "B00JF5GAZA", "B00133QNSG", "B009LDCWWG", "B00133QNRW", "B000E5KQM8", "B000F3UAE8", "B000FL7CAK", "B000B8QFYG", "B003L77GWE", "B00EIL7E9C", "B00B1RB7TO", "B00191AEYQ", "B0030Y12AA", "B0011FLGZQ", "B000AJJNI6", "B001ILFUA0", "B001MVWRNE", "B000095ZGW", "B000RW3YYA", "B00K0D9760", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B000NA28I4", "B000LC4ZI0", "B000BOH98G", "B000AJJNFE", "B000O77SN6", "B00005JLYW"], "bought_together": ["B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVM8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVKK", "B0046XG48O", "B000EHSVLY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 154783}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 32.59, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B00006RCNX", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RSRJ6FCWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Third Season"}

{"description": "Many movies strive to capture the confused, yearning spirit of The Graduate or The Catcher in the Rye; Igby Goes Down succeeds. Igby (Kieran Culkin) is a teen struggling to find any purpose or meaning to his life; surrounding him are his tyrant mother Mimi (Susan Sarandon), schizophrenic father Jason (Bill Pullman), wealthy and deceitful godfather D.H. (Jeff Goldblum), and cold brother Oliver (Ryan Phillippe)--all of whom have their own problems. While evading being sent to yet another boarding school, Igby seeks solace with two women: Rachel (Amanda Peet), a drug-addicted dancer who's D.H.'s mistress, and Sookie (Claire Danes), a college student who becomes perhaps his only friend. Culkin carries the film, ably supported by the superb cast; script, direction, and performances are razor sharp. Igby Goes Down doesn't let anyone--including Igby--off the hook for their cruelty, hypocrisy, or lack of empathy. --Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006JMQ4", "B002FP1426", "B00005JMJG", "B000FVQM2Y", "B000087JCE", "B00005JNC2", "B0000640VJ", "B0006TPE4C", "B0071HPP3M", "B00G3DA5XA", "6305428239", "1419897543", "B00005U14H", "B0041KKYF6", "B00FPUN57K", "B0016MJ6T2", "B000M5B98A", "B00HW3F1IO", "B00AEFY8MM", "B00DPUB5GA", "B00BN3ED8I", "B00003CXGA", "B0012E2GFK", "B0013D8LCC", "B0034G4OZE", "B000EDWKX8", "B0007UC8Y4", "B00013RC2K", "0767805763", "B000FFJYDY", "B00DW5IKYS", "B000K7VHQE", "0767821408", "B00009W5CA", "B0001EFUFK", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JL57", "B003U6SJYU", "B00D3DJIG8", "B00005V4XV", "B00000IC7G", "B0010X8NF0", "B003LXM1PK", "B000CS464G", "B000BZISVM", "B001CT05JE", "B00EO2I6SI", "B001PPLJIQ", "B00000G02H", "B00B04NIWM", "B00077BOFG", "B000ADWDFC", "B000BX8R10", "B00AFEY354", "B0001CNRRU", "B004OUZLGK", "B00005T30L", "B000BOH904", "B00GGMKSGM", "B0006J28KK", "B0010DM3R4", "B000V6LSOA", "B00023P4N8", "B004SUDQ72", "B00008K7AO", "0792839706", "B00AEFXE9U", "B00384TDZ8", "B005PTMPYA", "B0008JIJ10", "B00006AUIH", "B000QUEQ4K", "B00007L4KI", "B0000VV4OK", "0767821599", "B00005JNP4", "0767812158", "B0058ZPNOK", "B000CBG5PG", "B000NO39FG", "B000M4RG7E", "B002PLPQLU", "B001URA5XY", "B004IK30KA", "B007L6VR12", "B00996RSYM", "B000H0MKOC", "B00002E20R", "B000286RP2", "B002ONC9NC", "B008220BA2", "B00007AJF8", "B00003CWTI", "B00000IQW4", "B008OHV49W", "B00BMKGZVA", "B001FOK70S", "B004XVMCMG", "B00013RC7K", "B000F5GNX8"], "bought_together": ["B00006JMQ4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00006JMQ4", "B00005JMJG", "B002M9WW4E", "B0010X8NF0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 81400}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.98, "brand": "MGM (Video &amp; Dvd)", "asin": "B00007JXWX", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GWGWY7M9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Igby Goes Down"}

{"description": "DEAD OF NIGHT A group of strangers is mysteriously gathered  at a country estate where each reveals a chilling tale of the  supernatural. First, a racer survives a brush with death only to receive  terrifying premonitions from beyond the grave. Then a teen's innocent  game of hide-and-seek leads to an encounter with the macabre. Next, a  young couple purchases an antique mirror that unleashes a horrific power  from its past. In a lighter vein, two competitive golfers play for  stakes that may haunt the winner forever. Finally, a renowned  ventriloquist descends into an abyss of madness and murder when his  dummy develops a mind of its own. But even after these frightening tales  are told, does one final nightmare await them all? Britain's venerable  Ealing Studios brought together four brilliant directors -Charles  Crichton (THE LAVENDER HILL MOB), Basil Dearden (THE MIND BENDERS),  Alberto Cavalcanti (NICHOLAS NICKLEBY) and Robert Hamer (KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS) to create this classic chiller that remains one of the most  influential horror films ever made.

When  fortunes are won and lost with the turn of a card, will one man wager  his very soul on a final twist of fate?

{"description": "Delenn's future love interest, Captain John Sheridan (Bruce Boxleitner) arrived onBabylon 5in the first episode of season 2, \"Points of Departure.\" The show marked the handing over of command ofB5to Sheridan from Commander Jeffery Sinclair, actor Michael O'Hare becoming a victim of studio politicians who wanted a bigger star in the leading role. This excellent installment also revealed more about why the Minbari surrendered to Earth at the Battle of the Line when they were on the verge of victory. \"Revelations\" explains that Sheridan's wife, Anna, died during an archaeological survey of the world Z'ha'dum, the name being just one of many references to Tolkien's the Lord of the Rings (the bridge at Khazad-Dum). \"The Geometry of Shadows\" introduced the Technomages, characters who featured more significantly in the ill-fated spinoff seriesCrusade(1999), while \"The Coming of Shadows\" proved to beBabylon 5's finest hour to date. The story of political intrigue foreshadowing the fate of two of the major characters beatApollo 13,Toy Story,12 Monkeys, andStar Trek: Deep Space Nineepisode \"The Visitor\" to win the Hugo award for Best Dramatic Presentation at the 1996 World Science Fiction Convention and proved so powerful that J.

The inclusion of a PSI-Corps commercial paid homage to Paul Verhoeven's satirical ads inRobocop(1987), while his laterStarship Troopers(1997) seemed at times like a spoof ofB5's earnest space opera. In \"In the Shadow of Z'ha'dum,\" Sheridan learns that Morden was on the ship on which Anna died; the episode sees the captain pushed to his limits by grief and determination to discover why Morden survived. Three exceptional shows conclude the season. The Narn-Centauri war escalates in \"The Long, Twilight Struggle,\" Sheridan faces a most unusual ordeal in \"Comes the Inquisitor,\" and in \"The Fall of Night\" all hope of peace is shattered as a nerve-racking assassination attempt reveals a startling secret about Ambassador Kosh.--Gary S.

{"description": "Since winning an Academy Award for his exuberant performance inJerry Maguire, Cuba Gooding Jr. has gotten little but static from critics for a spate of calamitous career choices not seen since '80s-vintage Burt Reynolds. But he triumphantly returns to Oscar-worthy status with his moving performance as Radio, a mentally challenged young man, whom South Carolina high school football coach Harold Jones (Ed Harris) takes under his nurturing wing. This does not play well with the school's patient but questioning principal (Alfre Woodard); the school's biggest athletic booster, who views Radio as a distraction; the man's son, the team's star player, who plays cruel pranks on the trusting Radio; and the Coach's teenage daughter, who feels neglected. Almost all will be won over by Radio's trusting and good nature. Based on aSports Illustratedstory,Radiowas adapted for the screen by Mike Rich, screenwriter ofThe Rookie, and as in that superior family film, the heroics are mostly off the field. As Coach says, with all the subtlety of a blitz, \"We're not the ones been teaching Radio; he's the one been teaching us.\" The ending, in which we see the actual Radio, still cheering his team on 26 years later, will melt the most cynical hearts.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JPBO", "B002VECM6S", "B000056VP4", "B000066HAS", "B00004W221", "B000J3OTT6", "B000EXZFCQ", "0792843592", "6305531293", "B00AEFXOKO", "B000068NNU", "B001LGXIA6", "B002NZK5UK", "0788815466", "B000KHYN9C", "6305428352", "B0001US66Y", "B000N6U0E2", "B00000IQV7", "B00004TJQJ", "B002D755AI", "B00125WAWS", "B0006FYOTC", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00005JNEW", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00KPYT9PS", "B000FVQLQQ", "B000KLQUS0", "B0068FZ0GK", "B000Q7ZNZ4", "B002VWNIBI", "B000K2UGZM", "B001FB55NK", "B004KPLVX6", "B00722MQE2", "B0026S2TU8", "B004DK5CW4", "B0001ADAVK", "630542845X", "B00005JKWX", "B000CDSS18", "B0000YTP02", "B00006HAWN", "B00AEFZ63M", "6305133468", "B00AEFXOE0", "B009NNM9OA", "B000MNOX94", "B000PHVZNE", "B00AEFY17E", "B000G1R394", "B001QB5SS6", "B005OZVXCU", "B000FVR1T2", "B0000AM6NV", "B002YMWQ2M", "B002VWNICM", "B0023UZBBI", "B009YQJ2Q4", "B00005JMCN", "B0026JI1R2", "B0002TSZI8", "B000KF0GWW", "078324021X", "6305428387", "B0038M2AZA", "B008FCX2D2", "B000QQLVPQ", "0767836359", "0783225733", "B000X5RBXG", "B004SEUJOQ", "B00KD5HFJG", "B00AMEZDJW", "B00AEFXV3E", "B000RBA6C4", "B00AEFXY6I", "0767802497", "B000FFJYB6", "B000274T94", "B0000648ZR", "B00133KFGW"], "bought_together": ["B002VECM6S", "B000056VP4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000X5RBXG", "B000056VP4", "B000J3OTT6", "B00005JPBO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 13680}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "Team Marketing", "asin": "B00008EY60", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510370Y4VYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Radio"}

{"description": "Season 2 ofFelicitynot only sees the massacre of star Keri Russell's golden locks (at one point, a minor character refers to the new, short-cropped Felicity as \"Chia-Head\") but endless turmoil--most of it quite addictive to watch--in perhaps seven or eight overlapping romances.First there's the issue of season 1's cliffhanger. Did Felicity spend her summer with former high-school crush Ben (Scott Speedman) or her dormitory's resident advisor, Noel (Scott Foley), who harbors strong feelings for her? Episode 1 teases us with the answer while laying the bumpy groundwork for our heroine's sophomore year: Felicity has come back to college in New York City as an R.A. in her old dorm, once again sharing a room--much to her discontent--with acerbic Wiccan-punk Meghan (Amanda Foreman). Ben has a part-time job working in a coffee shop owned by Felicity's confidante Javier (Ian Gomez). Noel is sharing an apartment with another Felicity ally, Elena (Tangi Miller), as well as filmmaker Sean (Greg Grunberg), who previously made a documentary focusing on Ben and Felicity's relationship.Tangled connections and shifting loyalties make for a long, involving second year in this drama-comedy from Disney and Imagine Entertainment. Characters fall in and out of love, earn and betray trust, leap before they look, and redeem themselves with powerful acts of forgiveness or faith.Felicitycreators J.J. Abrams (writer,Forever Young) and Matt Reeves (director,Relativity) set out to capture the unique contradictions of young adulthood in this show--in particular, clinging to a precise college track while trying to make sense of post-adolescent love and responsibility--and for the most part succeed very well. Sometimes too well: The storylines may become a little redundant, the drama a tad flat with such singular interest in the muddled passions of 19-year-olds. But each episode is sharply written, comically incisive, and never less than watchable.Great special features: Keri Russell's audition, audio commentaries, a never-before-seen pilot, and theFelicityEmmy Parody, i.e., a spoof of the TV show produced for an Emmy Award telecast.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0077PTWY6", "B00BGQ2NIO", "B00BGQ2NDO", "B0006J28DM", "B000TGURZ8", "B0001IN0T4", "B002KQ6UE2", "B000FUTVPA", "B00369ERC4", "B0056GLNQI", "B005CGI3ZG", "B0077PTX0E", "B0058EE6OO", "B0077PTWH8", "B0016OOM6W", "B004GJYRFA", "B0077PTWX2", "B003INBNV6", "B00BMKGZVA", "B001RHGRU2", "B0081QF6Q8", "B003R0MF6W", "B00127RAGM", "B00000IP8T", "B000F3UAE8", "B001ULCY48", "B001UHOWYM", "B000U1ZV2G", "B000LXH3SI", "B0009A407A", "B000NOKFGW", "B000BNXD6O", "B005DCJ0Q0", "B004MWLXTY", "B0001EQHXO", "B000N3T0EG", "B004WO9OMA", "B0011UBDS6", "B0030VANIU", "B00008AOX3", "B002ZTQW3S", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B0018CWF02", "B00ADQDTPE", "B001FB5TAY", "B003L77G56", "B00005JPII", "B003F3NE7K", "B00L9OPOSO", "B003L77G42", "B0018CWEVW", "B001VPJYZU", "B003LXM1PK", "B001OQCVCE", "B001DZOCVO", "B003QZSWRY", "B000P6YNT8", "B000R7HRRA", "B008L0YMWS", "B0058YPIF0", "B000065CVV", "B001RXDM2C", "B004M9ZI0C", "B002AK9UOK", "B00ECGHM5O", "B00A8KJN8M", "B003L77GCE", "B0050MB5P2", "B002AMVEEM", "B0006FFRBG", "B0024FAD7O", "B000FL7CAK", "B001CDKQ8K", "B00005JNAF", "B009LDD4V4", "B0041KKYI8", "B005CA4SOM", "B0007V6IW6", "B002KQ6UDS", "B0002234R2", "B000FS9MY2", "B0032UYFAQ", "B00CKJJ1G8", "B00DXLO086", "B000NA2BEU", "B00CKJJ1IG", "B00KM5F31O", "B00DXLO0D6", "B00B1LKXV8", "B00133QNS6", "B00561BNI6", "B000GFLEKY", "B001MVWRNE", "B004ZG5F0K", "B0002RQ3MK", "B000OCXNQW", "B002AMVEJ2", "B0051GOB2G", "B001MVYUP2", "B0031DMU5Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0077PTWY6", "B000TGURZ8", "B00369ERC4", "B00BMKGZVA"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 148055}, "asin": "B00008GQ33", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FR4M3NXRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Felicity - Sophomore Year Collection (The Complete Second Season)"}
{"description": "Depending on how you liked this romantic comedy, you just might find more laughs in the delightful banter between the director and his two stars on the commentary track. Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant join writer-director Marc Lawrence for a lively 102 minutes of conversation. Not much movie magic is discussed, but the three talents will sacrifice all for a good joke. It's best to watch the commentary track with the \"Two Bleeps Notice\" viewing option: when a heart appears on-screen, you can immediately view outtakes from that stage of the film. The flubs, on-set antics, and jokes are all guaranteed to bring a laugh. Other extras include two additional scenes (the wedding finale was judicially cut) and a HBO puff-piece on the making of the film. Yet the disc is a must-have for any fan of Bullock or Grant because it offers a chance to listen in on them; they're just as charming off-screen as on.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002K0WBXW", "6304765266", "B000023VTP", "B00005JPE3", "B000YDBPAM", "B00AEBB8NS", "B000HEWEE4", "0783235380", "B00003CXSM", "B0009OL7Z4", "B0000897EG", "B00AEBB8YW", "B0007PLLBU", "B0021L8UZS", "B00006ZXSO", "B00AEFY99O", "B0000AOV4I", "B004SIP9RO", "B004SIP8JI", "B00007E2F5", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B00008G7UF", "B00006ZXSQ", "B0038N9X3Q", "B001ECDVK4", "B00006FMUW", "B00005JPSM", "B002NZK5V4", "B002ZG989G", "B000MQC9H4", "B00066FB2A", "B000CEV3M8", "B00000JGHN", "B00005JN3W", "B00005JG6N", "B00005JL7Q", "B002SYAGNC", "B00004UEDQ", "B000CCBCAS", "B00081U7HC", "B0015I2RT8", "B00068GTK6", "B000NA1WE0", "B0006GANOQ", "B002ZG988M", "B00006ZXSN", "B00AEBB9WI", "B005XB8SRS", "6305213283", "B0045HCJJ4", "B002ZG9968", "B00E8RKHWW", "B004SEUJK0", "B00006ZXSL", "B000A343RI", "B00AKGG6JS", "B0006A9FIM", "B00005O5CM", "B00AEFXWXI", "6305236569", "B00008G6E8", "B00AEFXYOA", "B004EPZ070", "B002VECM6S", "B002P413IC", "B00AEFYWQY", "B000QGDY0G", "B003B3V0N4", "B0013D8LHC", "0780625277", "B003Y5H574", "B0000VD02Y", "0767811100", "B00164X59M", "6305736685", "B001AKTZW8", "B001WAKOW6", "B00EP2SN58", "B00EIBO8T6", "B000XJD33O", "B000BNX3B4", "B00006ZXSK", "B004SIP8LG", "B00005JM55", "0767821769", "B004SIP9VA", "B00AEFYSEA", "B0009KA2OA", "B001C5LLQ4", "B00164KYV4", "B002NZK5R8", "B002NZK5VO", "B002NZK5RS", "B000683VI4", "0800141660", "B0002Y121K", "B0071HPOGK", "B00AEFXKUI", "B00006ZXSI", "B003Y5H524"], "bought_together": ["B002K0WBXW", "6304765266"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002K0WBXW", "B004SIP9RO", "6304765266", "B000023VTP"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18204}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.56, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00008NRI7", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VJyiu%2ByUL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Two Weeks Notice (Full-Screen Edition) (Snap Case)"}
{"description": "To resolve the season 2 cliffhanger, General Hammond rounds up every conceivable ally to rescue the SG-1 team from Hathor's clutches and gets a much-needed field trip in the process. \"Into the Fire \" is actually a weak opening for the new year, but does boast some impressive visuals as Hammond and Brat'ac pilot a shuttle through an open Stargate (euphemistically called \"threading the needle\"). In subsequent episodes, Daniel Jackson is intrigued by the planet Orban's scientific advances over only a few years. An exchange of knowledge is agreed and the precise \"Learning Curve\" of their children is revealed. Still recalling the original movie, O'Neill is concerned for the siblings because of the loss of his son. In \"Demons\" some serious lambasting of organized religion occurs in a storyline concerning a medieval Christian village that's being terrorized by a giant Goa'uld servant creature. This episode both brings to light and questions each of the principal characters' beliefs.\"Forever in a Day\" begins an important storyline about Daniel's wife Sha're's stolen child who is a \"Harcesis,\" an illegal breeding between Goa'uld hosts. Then an earlier thread is picked up in \"Past and Present\" on planet Vyus whose people all suffer amnesia. Their leader Ke'ra (played by Megan Leitch who's portrayed Mulder's missing sister in The X-Files) is a link to the earlier \"Prisoners\" episode and the dangerous \"destroyer of worlds\". In a two-part cliffhanger, Sam must attempt to rescue her father, face Satan himself on a prison moon, and resurrect \"Jolinar's Memories\" from the Goa'uld she was briefly possessed by, then \"The Devil You Know\" reveals an embarrassing secret that could allow the team to escape the clutches of Satanic Sokar. \"Pretense\" is one of those sci-fi series staples as a character is put on trial to prove their guilt on behalf of another. \"Urgo\" expands the general sardonic humor with a little pathos for the guest appearance by Dom DeLuise. Lots of slapstick ensues.\"A Hundred Days\" is the three months O'Neill spends stranded on planet Edora by the fire rain of a passing asteroid belt. Then in \"Shades of Grey\" he appears to suffer a total personality switch when he steals technology from the Tollan and is insubordinate in the extreme.

It's hard to describe just how captivated the nation's media and viewing public were with cheesemeister Aaron Spelling's ABC-TV hit, but for awhileCharlie's Angelswas wildly popular appointment television at its most self-consciously banal. The first season's three (and best-remembered) belles--lioness Farrah Fawcett (then Farrah Fawcett-Majors), pin-up babe Jaclyn Smith, and Thinking Man's beauty Kate Jackson--were something like primetime Spice Girls, gracing countless magazine covers and bestselling posters. The idea (even if a fan of the show didn't happen to be a straight male) was that one was compelled to choose a favorite angel as a kind of ink-blot window onto one's subconscious life.While the 2000Angelsfeature film(starring Cameron Diaz, etc.) kept faith with the original show's self-mockingly sloppy storytelling, there's nothing like seeing the old episodes for a lesson in narrative hubris. Basically, the three leading characters were bored policewomen wooed away to a private firm owned and operated by the unseen sybarite, Charlie (voiced--over speakerphone--by an uncredited John Forsythe). After a long set-up each week, the girls' investigations typically saw them going undercover: as fashion models--no great stretch--in \"Night of the Strangler\"; nurses in \"Terror on Ward One\"; roller-derby stars in \"Angels on Wheels\"; and vulnerable convicts (of course) in \"Angels In Chains.\" The exploitation factor is not as bad as it might have been. The cast was so glamorous, their chemistry so perfect,Charlie's Angelsnever became a mere meat market. Despite such nods to modernity as Fawcett's no-bra look, the episodes were old-fashioned in their heroine-in-peril appeal, yet there was a difference: The Angels looked out for themselves and each other.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001BS3IE", "B000FDFSH2", "B0028RABR0", "B000B8IA3U", "B003W5C0TY", "B00AIA884W", "B000Z6GT18", "B005LFQRTC", "B0001ZMWYG", "B000ASDFIG", "B004M9ZI0C", "B00018D3RI", "B005EVY8NA", "B00080ZG2E", "B0018O5WTQ", "B0007CNY54", "B008OR5X6M", "B0006Z2KZ2", "B00AA8Q0JM", "B00005JO4F", "B000GRU09I", "B00023GGAI", "B00A4Y62JU", "B000NQRV8U", "B0007Y8AYC", "B0028SVY3Y", "B00008EYBH", "B002WQ79A4", "B007KW5M6I", "B000EQ45BU", "B00HZMZ286", "B0000DFZ5O", "B0007V6IWQ", "B000QUEQ68", "B00005JOJR", "B0006Z2L4W", "B003L77FWA", "B000291Q3Y", "B000LE16VC", "B001HUHBC2", "B008H6GHII", "B000FDDYPA", "B000WQWPSM", "B003L77FWU", "B000E1EHPY", "B002A5EBMQ", "B000BGR1B4", "B000HIVIOM", "B000GW8UAE", "B0006IUDXA", "B00005JOA4", "B0007IO6V4", "B00005JMHI", "B0002COTDA", "B000K7UBXE", "B0024FAD7Y", "B00DYQ1GBE", "B006CR2OWM", "B000CS45AG", "B00JDCP0QA", "B00008YLVB", "B0055CP9MC", "B0012IXBNC", "B000PMGS5E", "B000HEVZ7Q", "B00000F6RL", "B000BUE5CI", "B00EIBO8PU", "B0014VPFKY", "B000EHSVB4", "B000LXGXY8", "B0002MHDW4", "B004X1M3DE", "B004UV3KSE", "B00028G7LG", "B000HWZ4HU", "B000VS6R30", "B00005JLYW", "B000GW8U9U", "B000NDEXO8", "B0007YMWFK", "B00005JO3P", "B00803LRK6", "B00005JLEY", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B000HEVZLC", "B001D2WUDE", "B003BGZ61S", "B009L0NC82", "B0058J3S16", "B000HIVIOC", "B000O77SNG", "B000E5KQLY", "B000PGTPC8", "B000F48D0U", "B00GLPYVQC", "B001J0FVYK", "B00DXLO0BI"], "bought_together": ["B0001BS3IE", "B000FDFSH2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008H6GHII", "B0001BS3IE", "B00GOC750Q", "B000FDFSH2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 32104}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 10.16, "brand": "Columbia Tri Star", "asin": "B00008WJEZ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51537RK5V7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Charlie's Angels: Season 1"}

{"description": "Nobody would argue with the thought that Sissy Spacek is the perfect heroine of Stephen King's scary tale of teenage telekinesis.

Her transformation from doormat to vengeful prom queen remains surefire wish fulfillment for anyone who ever felt a misfit in high school.

{"description": "It wasn't until the beginning ofStargate SG-1's fourth season that fans knew to take the Replicator threat seriously. The spidery nasties had only seemed like one of many new enemies introduced in previous years. But when the one seemingly omnipotent backbone of the galaxy was asking Earth for help, clearly we were in real trouble! In fact, the team's list of enemies expanded and got far more complicated this year. Proving without a shadow of a doubt that this is science fiction, the Russians reveal they have their own Stargate program and ask the Americans for help. This twist allows for exploration of all the political machinations occurring behind the scenes of the SG-C, all of which appear to stem from the embittered Senator Kinsey (Ronny Cox).There were quite a few Earth-based stories in the year, but not all the new enemies were originally local. Willie Garson comically guest-starred as Martin, a geekily suspicious guy with too much knowledge of the Stargate. More sinister was an old flame of Daniel's turning into something far more painful than an old wound (thanks to an ancient Egyptian curse). Thankfully, the writers hadn't forgotten the importance of one-off storylines too. In \"Upgrades\" the team learns a lesson in abuse of power. In \"The Other Side\" (featuringDS9's Rene Auberjonois) they learn about blind trust. In \"Scorched Earth\" a dangerous claim for a planet's ownership means they learn to value Daniel's contribution to the group dynamic. If only this last lesson were learned better, season 5 might not have ended up as muddled as it did.--Paul Tonks", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303961614", "B000F8O2OW", "B000F8O2PG", "B000F8O2OM", "B000F8O2PQ", "6302020190", "B000F8O2Q0", "B000HEZEY6", "B000PMFRTC", "B0010YSD7M", "B000B8IA2G", "B000LC4ZI0", "B0017MO10U", "B000RW3YYA", "B0017MO11O", "B00243FQFA", "B0029WLJHK", "B00402FGE4", "B0000844I8", "B004TJ1H3C", "B001MT7ZIS", "B002EL4RLQ", "B004WJT5H4", "B002KPINY8", "B002BAW6H2", "B002BAW6GI", "B002BAW6FE", "B001MT7ZL0", "B000AJJNFE", "B0093LE30U", "B004X60QWO", "B001BVRNPW", "B0093LE3BO", "B0093LE33C", "B002BAW6FY", "B0017XOF5A", "B004X60QE2", "B003L77GUG", "B005PPMHWE", "B0006FO9B0", "B0093LE3C8", "B00129W6LE", "B00242KD1S", "B000BNI90Y", "B00G4RBBQK", "B0048FUUAI", "B004HYW84G", "B0009299PG", "B0093LE32S", "B004EXWGHY", "B004O63BA2", "B0032JTUX4", "B00402FGEE", "B003L77GWE", "B005PPMHO2", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B00F6WXPSQ", "B000EXDS3Y", "B002BAW6GS", "B006LG74Q0", "B002ZCY872", "B007USE5CE", "B00ID3TPHA", "B002GP7ZVY", "B002BWP2IK", "B000EXDS34", "B00AMDA2QC", "B001HUWQEA", "B00GTZWXYQ", "B008I34Z34", "B000WTZ6SK", "B009LDCXQQ", "B00IURL19Y", "B001HX868M", "B002HRF68A", "B00GOC74QG", "B0007TKH66", "B002GP7ZW8", "B002JVWRD6", "B002E01MBA", "B002N5N5MK", "B00JEZWRE4", "B001FB4W0M", "B00G4RH1VE", "B006LG74RE", "B003BNO9GO", "B001C4CI8U", "B00A3717C0", "B00IWTVDUW", "B002GP7ZVO", "B003L77G2Y", "B000R9YLKY", "B0002Y0QV2", "B003BJO8IM", "B007ZFR67I", "B002CLKP00", "B0009JE6G6", "B000ERVJKE", "B001RHGRTS", "B00HWWUQWQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000F8O2OW", "B000F8O2Q0", "B000F8O2OM", "B000F8O2PG"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 133977}, "asin": "B00009X75H", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519WHHQ1CNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Stargate SG-1 Season 4 Boxed Set"}

As Kermit loses his livelihood, he plunges into the \"I wish I'd never been born\" mind-set instantly recognizable to George Bailey fans. It's going to take some Divine intervention (Whoopi Goldberg is cast as God, no less), plus a little help from a heavenly \"Clarence.\" Despite some moments where the script seems adrift (how hard it must be to live up to the irresistible precedent set by the 1979 premierMuppet Movie) and some humor that borders on risqu&#xE9;, Fozzie and the gang are in fine form.

{"description": "Harrison Ford lends his solid, perpetually disgruntled presence toHollywood Homicide, an action comedy in which he's paired with the squinty eyes and peaches-and-cream complexion of Josh Hartnett (Black Hawk Down,O). Radical French filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard would appreciate this complete deconstruction of the buddy-cop flick genre; basic cinematic elements (mismatched partners, a hard-ass superior riding them, arguments about who's going to drive, arguments about intuition vs. diligent detective work, the bad cop who killed Hartnett's father, etc.) have been scrambled and slapped together with no concern for coherence, making clear their innately artificial nature. Sex scenes and car chases come out of nowhere and disappear without consequence, providing arbitrary visual stimulus. During shootouts, it's impossible to tell who got killed or why, underscoring a basic doubt about the purpose of making movies likeHollywood Homicide. It's rare for a mainstream movie to be so daringly (if perhaps accidentally) avant-garde.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000F8DV1M", "B001DJLD08", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B001UDS4BS", "B00AEFYENK", "6305213283", "B00AEBB9UK", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00441GYZQ", "B00096S4DK", "B00005LB88", "6305133476", "0792844017", "0767803434", "B00AEFYW64", "B002ZG98FU", "B000K2UVZM", "B0045HCJ8K", "B0045HCJFS", "B000FKO5QK", "0767821513", "B00067BBMS", "B00AEBB9NM", "B002ZG97J2", "B00008EYA5", "B00005JLX2", "B000085EF5", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00008EY9G", "B004SEUJ9Q", "B004P7CN7W", "B000BYA4J2", "B0015OKWL2", "B004EPYZSK", "B002AT8K9W", "B0007IO6NM", "0767802578", "B001NY4WYC", "6304698747", "0790732149", "B00008K76V", "B00009MEKO", "B00005UQ9T", "B004EPYZT4", "0767818024", "B003LR5BD0", "B003A12WBQ", "0790731460", "6305263248", "B00004WG2F", "B000P0J06U", "B0087DFIYA", "B00008OE4W", "B000MGBLTQ", "B0034G4ORC", "B0019EXZY4", "6305133468", "B0000AZT79", "B0000B1OFL", "B002ZG96ZC", "B001OST0LW", "B000OYAT3U", "B00005R5GM", "B000LC3ICE", "B00E1HIWXU", "B00260HH2G", "B00BTYOYG2", "B001UV4XGA", "B0000A9GHD", "B003AWRM9W", "B004P7CMVE", "B000EHSVOG", "B00005N5S5", "B000XT1P4S", "B000069DOB", "B001BGS17Q", "B003Q6D2B4", "B001GMAVGE", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B00AEFXT1S", "B001VLBDD0", "B004A8ZWSS", "B000YDMPC4", "0792844874", "B001GKJ2E8", "B00AEBB9UU", "B000JYW5BE", "B000XJD34I", "B008CRB1HY", "B008JFURII", "B002AS464Q", "B0001Z37HM", "B000BFH2C8", "B00008K76W", "B000P0J08S", "0783229364", "B001SN78JO", "B00AEBB95K", "B00BUAEYVK", "B0045HCJ8A"], "bought_together": ["6305213283"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AU740H2", "B001UDS4BS", "B001DJLD08", "B00005LB88"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 45508}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.0, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0000B00KB", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XVMJ3CPGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hollywood Homicide"}
{"description": "Though it bears little resemblance to the original 1969 thriller starring Michael Caine, the 2003 remake ofThe Italian Jobstands on its own as a caper comedy that's well above average. The title's a misnomer--this time it's actually a Los Angeles job--but the action's just as exciting as it propels a breezy tale of honor and dishonor among competing thieves. Inheriting Caine's role as ace heist-planner Charlie Croker, Mark Wahlberg plays straight-man to a well-cast team of accomplices, including Mos Def, Jason Statham, and scene-stealer Seth Green in a variation of the role originally played by Noel Coward. As the daughter of Croker's ill-fated mentor (Donald Sutherland), Charlize Theron is recruited to double-cross a double-crosser (Edward Norton in oily villain mode), and once again, speedily versatile Mini Coopers play a pivotal role in director F. Gary Gray's exhilarating car-chase climax. It's perhaps the greatest product placement in movie history, and just as fun the second time around.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB86A", "B00AEFY0XE", "B0000AUHPB", "B0019EXZY4", "B00004Z4WR", "B005LAIGLE", "B001MTYRKC", "B000ZS8GWQ", "B000J3OTT6", "B00AEBB8LA", "B000P0J0BK", "B00BB67UNW", "B004HO6HWA", "B004P7CMVE", "0767818024", "B004ULNJIU", "B003Q6D2B4", "B001F12J0C", "B001QB9H10", "B004EPYZP8", "B008E70EES", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B0062P3392", "B001TODCII", "B002GSXKP6", "B000BTITKS", "B0010YVCB6", "B000K7UBSO", "078322933X", "B001ILHY1I", "B0007P0XBO", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B003UESJHO", "B000AP04FG", "B0002ZDVEU", "B000JYW5BE", "B000W1V5VU", "B00008AOVL", "B00005JLIF", "B000093FLA", "6305657947", "6304711891", "B003L20IG0", "B00DU22OI6", "B005LAIGRS", "B008JFURII", "B002XMGGK6", "B002DU39GW", "B00HEPC0TS", "B005LAIILM", "B000P0J0C4", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000W9DTG6", "B000M341QE", "B002NZK5UU", "B000X1Z0C4", "B00AEFZ2DG", "B000FKO5QK", "B001UV4XGA", "B00023B1LC", "B000GFLKF8", "B00005JLSB", "B000ENC5YW", "B00AEFY5B6", "B001J710Z2", "B002ZG99H2", "B000VWYJ86", "B00005JN0T", "B002ZG999U", "6305428115", "B00000JGNP", "B00140PK82", "B002ZG9864", "B002GIBVVQ", "B004H83IFK", "B00BEIYLO8", "B00005UQ9T", "6304806434", "0783240295", "B005LAIGXW", "B00003CY0V", "B000KF0GWW", "B000P0J0EW", "B00005JLX2", "B002VECM6S", "B002ZG97RE", "B002O3Z4XY", "B000E5N684", "B002ZG980U", "B00005B6JZ", "B001N44BVQ", "B000FKO3WG", "B00005JKBC", "B007REV4T8", "B00E8RKHWW", "B001DZOC6Y", "B0012KJ0DK", "B002GHHHP6", "B00005JN0W", "B00AQSN7HE"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBB86A", "B00AEFY0XE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000AUHPB", "B00AEBB86A", "B00004Z4WR", "B005LAIIHG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8732}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B0000B1OFL", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X762iDLcL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Italian Job"}

{"description": "The sixth season ofBuffy the Vampire Slayerfollowed the logic of plot and character development into some gloomy places. The year begins with Buffy being raised from the dead by the friends who miss her, but who fail to understand that a sacrifice taken back is a sacrifice negated. Dragged out of what she believes to have been heavenly bliss, she finds herself \"going through the motions\" and entering into a relationship with the evil, besotted vampire Spike just to force her emotions.  Willow becomes ever more caught up in the temptations of magic; Xander and Anya move towards marriage without ever discussing their reservations; Giles feels he is standing in the way of Buffy's adult independence; Dawn feels neglected. What none of them need is a menace that is, at this point, simply annoying--three high school contemporaries who have turned their hand to magical and high-tech villainy. Added to this is a hungry ghost, an invisibility ray, an amnesia spell and a song-and-dance demon (who acts as rationale for the incomparable musical episode \"Once More, with Feeling\").This is a year in which chickens come home to roost: everything from the villainy of the three geeks to Xander's doubts about marriage come to a head, often--as in the case of the impressive wedding episode--through wildly dark humor. The estrangement of the characters from each other--a well-observed portrait of what happens to college pals in their early 20s--comes to a shocking head with the death of a major character and that death's apocalyptic consequences. The series ends on a consoling note which it has, by that point and in spite of imperfections, entirely earned.--Roz Kaveney", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EHSVN2", "B000EHSVM8", "B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVLE", "B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVKK", "B000I0QLRI", "B000I0QLRS", "B000I0QLS2", "B000I0QLQY", "B000I0QLR8", "B007H9CNOI", "B000HD1482", "B003YF9Q08", "1593078226", "B00006J3WH", "B0006IUE16", "B0009W5J4Q", "B002JVWR4U", "B000ERVJM2", "B000GG4Y6O", "B000JLTRIG", "B000CCBCGM", "1595825584", "1595826106", "B000B5XOW0", "B00001R3O1", "B0024FAR66", "B001FB4W0C", "B00AMDA2QC", "1595821651", "B005CM1IIE", "B000OIOPHC", "B006LG74Q0", "B00JF5G8WU", "159307963X", "B00344EAQO", "B0000AQS0F", "B00466H3CW", "B002U8XW9Q", "B000X5SPBI", "1595824154", "B000BOH990", "B000BOH98G", "1595823425", "B00133QNSG", "B003R4ZMN6", "B00511N79O", "B000O77SN6", "B008EVT42W", "B000BOH986", "B000CNE0SS", "B009LDCXNY", "B0002XVKMM", "B000RO6JYK", "B00076ONT6", "B009LDCWWG", "B00IWTVDUW", "B000FP2OPY", "B006LG74RE", "B000R7GKQE", "B0010YSD7M", "B00243FQFA", "B000O77SMW", "1442412097", "B003R0MF7G", "B002JVWRAO", "B009LDD4V4", "B001MVWRNO", "B001AQO43M", "0789326302", "B000JW1TYU", "B000AO9BSS", "1595823107", "B004YM6JLO", "B0000C9JFQ", "B0006J28E6", "B001RXDM2C", "B000EXDS3E", "B005PPMHO2", "B00466H3CC", "B0058YPGL6", "B00133QNS6", "B00006FD9N", "B001992NWO", "B0001O3YLM", "1595829229", "B00A8KJN8M", "B003L77GAQ", "B00133QNRW", "B00005JNOG", "B001MVWRNE", "B00AMDA2P8", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B000G1R4TS", "B0077PTWHI", "B001QE99AQ", "B000EXDS34", "B00344EAKA", "B001M5UDGS"], "bought_together": ["B000EHSVN2", "B000EHSVM8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EHSVM8", "B000EHSVLY", "B0046XG48O", "B000EHSVLE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 112363}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 34.59, "brand": "", "asin": "B0000DANYD", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417707V8Z5L._SX300_.jpg", "title": "Buffy The Vampire Slayer - The Complete Sixth Season"}
{"description": "Season 4 began on a high point with the Centauri Prime in the grip of the insane Emperor Cartagia (Wortham Krimmer) and a run of six shows leading to the climax of the war against the Shadows in \"Into the Fire.\" If this colossal narrative was resolved a little too easily and the ultimate aim of the Shadows turned out to be a tad disappointing, it still proved to be the most powerful slice of space opera to ever grace the small screen. In the aftermath the sheer scale dropped back a little but the pace never slowed as the rest of the season played out in one relentless cycle of conspiracy, betrayal and conflict,Babylon 5siding with the rebel Mars colony against the totalitarian Earth.Meanwhile Delenn came increasingly into conflict with her own people and, paralleling her relationship with Sheridan, Garibaldi became involved with his ex-fianc&#xE9;e Lise Hampton (Denise Gentile), while an intense platonic love grew between Ivanova and Marcus Cole. On an unstoppable wave fuelled by roller-coaster plot twists and spectacular action shows from \"No Surrender, No Retreat\"--when Sheridan avows to overthrow EarthGov--to \"Rising Star\"--when the aim is realized--Babylon 5achieved a consistent excellence rare in television. Yet within that run \"Intersections in Real Time\" stood out as a bold experiment; essentially a two-hand drama taking place entirely within one dimly lit room. Beyond this a major character died and Sheridan and Delenn married before the season finale again broke with expectation. In \"The Deconstruction of Falling Stars,\" a future descendant of humanity one million years hence reviews excerpts from the history ofBabylon 5. In one sequence set in 2762, a Brother is devoted to the preserving of history some time after the \"Big Burn.\" A homage to Walter M. Miller's classicA Canticle for Leibowitz, Sheridan and Delenn have themselves become the stuff of legend.--Gary S.

{"description": "Released almost exactly 11 years after Clint Eastwood'sUnforgiven, Kevin Costner'sOpen Rangeproved yet again that the Western istheclassic American genre. While it lacks the thematic impact of Eastwood's masterpiece, Costner's first film since 1997's ill-fatedThe Postmanreturns the actor/director ofDances With Wolvesto the open prairies of America--in this case the free-range frontier of 1882--where legal \"free-grazing\" cattle drives were falling prey to empire-building land-owners. In the wake of territorial murder, free-grazing cowboys Boss (Robert Duvall) and Charley (Costner) seek vengeful justice against the ruthless rancher (Michael Gambon) who threatens their law-abiding survival. A feisty ally (the late Michael Jeter, in his next-to-final film role) and a doctor's sister (Annette Bening) offer support during climactic shootouts, masterfully staged with the shock and suddenness of real-life gunfire. Rich in character development and thick-hided humor, this handsome production redeemed Costner's directorial career with a well-told story (by Craig Storper, based on Lauran Paine's novelThe Open Range Men), flawless performances, and stunning Canadian locations.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000GFRI4K", "B0018PH3L0", "B000E5N6LG", "6304711905", "B001LRJH0U", "B004AOECXI", "B00116GEJS", "B0038EGD3I", "B00DZUV0M4", "B000XR9L50", "B003AWRMCE", "B00368PSKK", "B001LMAK88", "6305504024", "B00368PSKU", "B003NF97MQ", "B00005LOL0", "B003ASLJRC", "B00007G78A", "B002LII6PU", "B00AEBBA0E", "B001VC99HQ", "B003ASLJS6", "B003AWRM9M", "B003UESJME", "B002O3Z4XE", "B000BITVBA", "0767817710", "B000056H2J", "B00008IHAW", "B000059H7K", "B00005JMOW", "B0081FSMPG", "B0000YTP02", "B0045HCJTO", "B000EOTUSK", "B000W1SZBS", "B00CQ9VEDK", "B00008CMR4", "B001R0AY9Y", "B0007OY2OO", "078324021X", "0783228007", "B00AEFYSEA", "B0016OLXN2", "B00004WG2F", "B001KO1BCQ", "B00B83ROIE", "B00AEFYPHA", "B0018RWMNM", "B00A92MF6Q", "B004AOECTC", "B00002SSKG", "B00006AUHQ", "B00AEBBA36", "B00AEBB932", "B0035JHYJI", "B00004XPPG", "B009INAI02", "B002U4UYYQ", "0792839056", "B000KF0GWW", "0783229631", "B00001ZWUS", "B00007ELF1", "B00AMDA2OY", "B0006HBZXS", "B000NOIVT0", "B0007TKNM4", "B000A2WP7O", "B000A2WAQU", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00000K0DM", "B000O599Y4", "B001PO55AA", "B00005JNP4", "B000O599YE", "B00005JLV5", "B004KDYQYY", "B003Q7B6ZC", "B000P0J0EM", "B000ANVPP6", "B000O599WQ", "B001B187MU", "B007Y1NR1W", "B000059TFW", "B002O3Z510", "B00005JKZH", "B000P0J0EW", "6304698747", "B0045HCJSK", "B00AEBB8YM", "B00005JN0W", "B00IO03I6Q", "0792844874", "B000GIW9I2", "B0068FZ0O2", "078322592X", "B0006N2EZ0", "0783225725"], "bought_together": ["B000GFRI4K", "B0018PH3L0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0018PH3L0", "6304711905", "B004AOECXI", "B001LMAK88"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3051}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "Touchstone Video", "asin": "B0000TANUI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5166e3Ia3aL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Open Range"}
{"description": "The best movie musical you've never heard of isLove Me Tonight, a deliciously clever 1932 Rodgers and Hart romp. The film opens with a tour de force, as the rhythmic sounds of a Paris morning morph into music and we meet a humble tailor (Maurice Chevalier) whose future looks bright. At least he thinks so. And then the great song \"Isn't It Romantic?\" kicks in, introduced by Chevalier but immediately handed off to client, cab driver, and a series of tune-carriers who finally bring the catchy melody to a dreamy princess (Jeannette MacDonald). It's probably the giddiest sequence in a very fun film, and \"Isn't It Romantic?\" would continue popping up in Paramount movies for years (Billy Wilder was especially partial to it). The humble tailor must travel to the princess's chateau to collect a bill from family playboy Charlie Ruggles, which puts Chevalier in pleasant proximity to MacDonald and saucy Myrna Loy. It also brings forth more Rodgers and Hart goodies:  the classic \"Lover\" (a great romantic waltz played here as a lark), \"Mimi,\" and the title song. Rouben Mamoulian directed, in the full stride of his early-sound creativity (this was just after hisDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde), using a variety of effects that look positively New Wave. Chevalier and MacDonald are a delight together (by all means see them inThe Love ParadeandOne Hour with You, too), and Charlie Butterworth has some glorious moments as a prospective MacDonald suitor. Also worth the price of admission:  the spectacle of crusty character actor C. Aubrey Smith singing.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000ZM1MJG", "B00C2QWY86", "B0074JOVA0", "B000F7CMQI", "B008LZLH9E", "B005MXKRKS", "B008LZMN24", "B0050PTG8C", "B007Z3OA2O", "B0074JOV78", "B005OWKP90", "B007Z3N7BE", "B0050PWZD0", "B00007CVS4", "B009L2T9VO", "B00KIZY3XW", "B0074JOVLO", "B001QFFBAM", "B009L2TAJU", "B009L2T99Q", "B0012GVMIK", "B004132I6Q", "B00J70UXEM", "B0024FAG1C", "B00I9BU49Y", "B00CA4S308", "B00005JKSC", "B00J2PQYY0", "B000HT3Q2S", "B00C2QWYP4", "B00J2T18MY", "B00012FXJ0", "B0041T50J2", "B00006LPEO", "B00406UJWE", "B00CUKTGSA", "B00D9BNONW", "B00HVOFP9O", "B00005QW59", "B005F265FW", "B00005JKGX", "B0017IAIGU", "B000E6ESXK", "B000E0OE1M", "B0024FAG1M", "B002SUS3IQ", "B0012GVMIA", "B00KGLS050", "B002EAYEEC", "B005F265IE", "B0009S4IJC", "B001675YPW", "B00I04SVV8", "B00406UJZG", "B00D9BNOKK", "B0012GVMIU", "0199973849", "B00ICWO1LC", "B008JEJROE", "B00C2QWZ3U", "B000PKG7CU", "B0002XNT08", "B0007939MK", "B00J2TE3DU", "B00GJT1ZPU", "B0002B15RE", "B000SIWHBE", "B0047BXR1C", "B000GRUQL0", "B009L2T9LE", "B003552QWC", "B0011FDVEK", "B00I9BU5ZM", "B000PAAK5A", "B00K6D1SAC", "B006TTC5A4", "B000E8JO32", "B00K6D1S7A", "0971199817", "B0074JOV0U", "B00BQ6TIVO", "B00FNRA1D6", "B0006H32DY", "B002EAYE6U", "B0079R1M40", "B002LH42H2", "B000I2JDF8", "B00FNRA0KA", "078324097X", "B000E6ESX0", "B0012GVMI0", "B009RNK10K", "B000E6ESWG", "B000FTCLQW", "B00008AOWJ", "B000KJU13C", "B0018RKEQ4", "B002TOL4EQ", "B000083C8K", "B00J2TCHP6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00KIZY3XW", "B00KIZYDCI", "B00KIZY7QA", "B00KIZYANK"]}, "price": 19.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 65860}, "asin": "B0000UX4V2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H77FZ2VYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Love Me Tonight"}
{"description": "Like the movie, the DVD extras are smarter and a lot more entertaining than your average flick. The making-of feature (\"Lessons Learned\") has the usual behind-the-scenes banter but Jack Black is in fine form--that is, something special--interviewing as much as being interviewed about the making of the film. His unique pitch to Led Zeppelin to use their song is alone worth the price of the DVD. Black is more his maniacal self and a bit more grating in MTV's Diary segment, but his commentary track with director Richard Linklater is as insightful as it is funny. Ok, it's a lot more funny, but entertaining throughout. The commentary track featuring just the kid actors is less so, but any preteen would love listening to it. To top it off, the DVD-ROM has Dewey Finn's instantly famous blackboard history of rock. You can drill down to the bands mentioned and get a brief history of each.

In the style of the late Mario Bava, this unforgettable classic contains scenes that rank among the very best the genre has to offer. In sparkling Technicolor (struck from a negative untouched for nearly 40 years), the film emerges as a truly stunning piece of cinematic mastery &#x96; as well as a nightmare-inducing vision of hell. A young artist is hired to do a study of a famous local landmark, a windmill that contains stone statues of notorious female monsters of the past. One day he meets a mysterious, dangerously beautiful woman at the mill. Before long, he is drawn into her clutches. Just what is the terrible secret that keeps her hiding from the world?

{"description": "No actor works harder to open a movie than Tom Cruise. His enthusiasm is throughout the DVD extras as he mirrors his samurai character by constantly talking about \"loyalty\" and \"discipline\" while working on the film. However as a post-movie experience, the top-line extras with Cruise and director Edward Zwick are repetitive and underwhelming, with too many clips from the film we assume DVD viewers have just seen. The History Channel show is also a pre-release promotional device that misses an opportunity to really dig into this intriguing time period. Better are segments on the costumes, the production design, and how you put together an Imperial army--in New Zealand, no less. Zwick's low-key and dense commentary (plus a \"Video Journal\") is not vital, but he illustrates many of the little peculiarities it took to make the wide-ranging film come together. There are two deleted scenes; a samurai's first appearance is particularly memorable.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFY5B6", "B002O3Z50Q", "B00004XPPG", "B00AMSLDTM", "B0002YLCG0", "B0000DZTIW", "B000AARKOO", "B000QXDED6", "B003U0AHBO", "B00AEFXKUI", "B000A2WP7O", "B008MIMWOY", "B00AEBBA36", "B004AOECXI", "6305692688", "B000MGB6NM", "B0000TANUI", "079283366X", "B00005JL78", "B000W1SZBS", "B004SIP88Y", "B0034G4P58", "B001TUZG4K", "B00AS1Q93S", "B000MRA592", "B00001ZWUS", "B000E5N6LG", "B000XR9L50", "B0001HLVS2", "B00HEPDGKA", "B003ASLJO0", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000P0J0EW", "B0000A2ZNX", "B00005JNTI", "B0018QPPXW", "B000065U1N", "B000095WW8", "B0002WZTOI", "B002VWNIEA", "B004U7MQWY", "B002VWNID6", "B008JFUO36", "B00AEBB86A", "B00005JN0W", "B0007Q6VXC", "B001LRJH0U", "B000MZHW40", "B0002IQMAM", "B00004WG2F", "B003INBO3I", "B000EHRVMY", "B000NOKFHQ", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEFXVCU", "B000YENUI6", "B000M341QE", "B0000YEEGM", "B001680M26", "B008R65XYC", "B002ZG99QS", "B00008K76U", "B000HRMAPE", "B007TBKAXK", "B00000G3PA", "0767810856", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00AEFXYJA", "B002T9H2LA", "B000P0J0AG", "B00003CXZ1", "B000O599YO", "B000FS9FCG", "6304711905", "B00AEFXRRO", "B000HRMAUY", "B001ILHY1I", "B002NZK5V4", "B002VWNICC", "B000VKL6ZM", "B001UDS4BS", "B002ZG997C", "B004SIP8ZM", "0800177967", "B0001O3YD0", "B00005ATZT", "B004XFZ3UU", "B00004Z4WR", "B005LAIH2W", "B0007TKNGA", "B00000JQB5", "B0012Q732O", "B002ZG97RE", "B0002VEUV2", "0800141741", "B002ZG977Y", "B00005N5S3", "B00008G8M4", "B0000B1OFL"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFY5B6", "B00004XPPG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000QXDED6", "B00BEJL6JK", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00JU949TK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 121880}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 17.25, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001JXOUS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EdSWs9r9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Last Samurai (Full Screen Edition)"}

{"description": "As the triumphant start of a trilogy,The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ringleaves you begging for more. By necessity, Peter Jackson's ambitious epic compresses J.R.R. Tolkien's classicThe Lord of the Rings, but this robust adaptation maintains reverent allegiance to Tolkien's creation, instantly qualifying as one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. At 178 minutes, it's long enough to establish the myriad inhabitants of Middle-earth, the legendary Rings of Power, and the fellowship of hobbits, elves, dwarves, and humans--led by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the brave hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood)--who must battle terrifying forces of evil on their perilous journey to destroy the One Ring in the land of Mordor. Superbly paced, the film is both epic and intimate, offering astonishing special effects and production design while emphasizing the emotional intensity of Frodo's adventure, and ends on a perfect note of heroic loyalty and rich anticipation.After the breaking of the Fellowship, Frodo and Sam journey to Mordor with the creature Gollum as their guide inThe Two Towers. Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) join in the defense of the people of Rohan, who are the first target in the eradication of the race of Men by the renegade wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee) and the dark lord Sauron. Fantastic creatures, astounding visual effects, and a climactic battle at the fortress of Helm's Deep makeThe Two Towersa worthy successor toThe Fellowship of the Ring, grander in scale but retaining the story's emotional intimacy.WithThe Return of the King, the greatest fantasy epic in film history draws to a grand and glorious conclusion. The trilogy could never fully satisfy those who remain exclusively loyal to Tolkien's expansive literature, but as a showcase for physical and technical craftsmanship it is unsurpassed in pure scale and ambition, setting milestone after cinematic milestone as Frodo and Sam continue their mission to Mordor to destroy the soul-corrupting One Ring. While the heir to the kingdom of Men, Aragorn, endures the massive battle at Minas Tirith with the allegiance of Legolas, Gimli, and Gandalf, Frodo and Sam must survive the schizoid deceptions of Gollum, who remains utterly convincing as a hybrid of performance (by Andy Serkis) and subtly nuanced computer animation. Jackson and cowriters Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens have much ground to cover; that they do so with intense pacing and epic sweep is impressive enough, but by investing greater depth and consequence in the actions of fellow hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), they ensure thatThe Return of the Kingmaintains the trilogy's emphasis on intimate fellowship and remains faithful to Tolkien's overall vision. By ending theLOTRtrilogy with noble integrity and faith in the power of imaginative storytelling,The Return of the King, like its predecessors, will stand as an adventure for the ages.--Jeff Shannon and David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B005OCFGTO", "B001DJLD1M", "B001BYMX4A", "B009JBWOU0", "B00003CXCT", "B00005JPH2", "B001BRJZPW", "B000QXDED6", "B000E8M0VA", "B000VWYJ86", "B000HEVZ9E", "B005COPWZW", "B00005JKZY", "0345538374", "B001F12J0C", "B0057RCFQS", "B00003CWT6", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00003CXC5", "B000I0RQVI", "B0060FXDCG", "B0054OGQM8", "B004M1A21K", "B001DHXT20", "B008MIMWP8", "B008JFUO72", "B001VLFE7G", "B00G1BPIOU", "B002HWRYJE", "B000YGDNPO", "B000VBIGCW", "B00E9PMML2", "B004H83IM8", "B004EPZ08O", "B0015XHP4A", "B001E75QH0", "B0090SI56Y", "B000P0J0AQ", "B001VLBDD0", "B008JFUS0U", "B00IV2I7IQ", "B003PIUINS", "B000UR9T8C", "B000U7WV1Y", "B006VRRGNK", "B007D5E7C2", "0345518845", "B0049IHX2C", "B00AZMFJYA", "B0015I2RT8", "B004LWZWGA", "B002I9Z8I0", "B0001HLVS2", "B002VPE1AW", "B004LWZW42", "B00003CXZ4", "B00E5I2MCM", "B004EPYZU8", "B008JFURII", "B00003CXC3", "B005LAIH54", "6305313687", "B0084IG8TM", "B00000K3D4", "B001CK1D44", "B00AEFXDO6", "B002ZG999U", "B00E9PMMX0", "B0042U94UQ", "B00275EGWY", "B001KVZ6FW", "B003Q6D2B4", "B000J4P9P8", "B0001Z4OXS", "B00177YA1K", "B003UYUQZW", "B0019L770A", "B000E6ESEY", "B003AWRMCE", "B000HCO83Q", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B0083SBMBM", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00011CZRE", "079284646X", "B00008G8M5", "B002ZG97YM", "B002ZG980U", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000U1ZV8K", "B008UZA8FY", "B005LAIIMG", "B004EPZ084", "B003EYVXTG", "B00005JKZV", "B00447L4JG"], "bought_together": ["B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HWWUQWQ", "B00005JKZY", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00003CWT6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 72846}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 39.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001VL0K2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51z4rwl-jOL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Originsis a spectacular four-part miniseries, first presented on PBS'sNova, about the beginnings of the universe, our solar system, life on Earth, and the possibility of extraterrestrial life on other planets. It is not a stretch to say thatOrigins, among all television documentaries about the evolving cosmos, offers the most breathtaking dramatic visual representation of Earth's tumultuous history, and the clearest, step-by-step explanation of the formation of planets, the development of water and living organisms, and the forces that shape other parts of our galaxy and beyond.Hosted by the engaging Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History,Originsconsists of four one-hour episodes. The first focuses on the initial billion years of Earth history, research into the emergence of water (which appeared surprisingly early, as it turns out, and could have been delivered by comets) and the birth of the moon. The second show concerns hardy, single-cell organisms on Earth developing, in some quite inhospitable places, into complex life forms, while the third covers the Big Bang and the final installment looks at theories involving extraterrestrial life. If the topics sound familiar, their presentation is always fresh, dynamic, and thoroughly accessible. WatchingOriginswould be a great, context-providing preface to the study of a number of niche subjects, including geology, physics, biology, and much else. An invaluable production.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000ZG0TA", "B0056031LE", "B004QSQMG8", "B0047HXMMU", "B004D7SBMU", "B001UW59JY", "B00IWULQQ2", "B008BJTQ0W", "B0001WTULW", "B002TCRQ6I", "B006WY0VRU", "0393327582", "B007IUEE8O", "B00465I1AG", "B000055ZOB", "B004D7SBLQ", "B0047HXMKM", "B003QWVPGW", "B0028ERBSA", "B0031SZER2", "B0038L0WF6", "B005F0TH2C", "B008IG0FEY", "B0077PBPXM", "B000GIXLLG", "B001N77YRG", "B00FNPQW7M", "B000BKDO6G", "1565856635", "B00FOLGW5C", "B00IAR2CHY", "B00005RG6J", "B00BCV3IN2", "B0015LPRPG", "B003NF97OE", "159102188X", "0393330168", "B000JJ5F8O", "B001IBCS3C", "B004XKVPLG", "B000BKDNY4", "B0056031FA", "B000MZGN54", "0393059928", "B005QW98IW", "B004K4FUWU", "B00IWULSTC", "B000C8STO4", "0393343626", "B004FOPFFC", "B000BITUD4", "B00BQI43E4", "B006QVRUY6", "B0039ZBM14", "B001R60ER0", "0385488351", "1576833445", "B00126808K", "B0000AYL48", "B000067J0I", "B005KLOPGY", "B002XNEIIM", "B002MIK0UI", "B0035JHYMK", "068486309X", "B003VMFWZW", "B001JXPC1O", "B00018U8YE", "0393082105", "B00IXPQUE4", "B000BITUCK", "B005GNLX3Y", "B00331RHEU", "1598038516", "B000C8STOE", "B000YY6VIC", "B000XBPDYY", "B00465I1A6", "B00BIYQPVA", "0309064880", "B00AK51Q8U", "B004D7SBD4", "B007IUEDW6", "B00HNR3ZF0", "B00IN69MWK", "0345331354", "B0027UY8CW", "B00153ZQY6", "B001IBCS2S", "B002TC6J1G", "0813527406", "B004PYDN4M", "B004D7SBH0", "0385488378", "B0030BS1FM", "B000ANVQ6Y", "B005KLOPLO", "B004AR4WIK", "0231075618", "B000VWX6TO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00IWULQQ2", "B000055ZOB", "B004QSQMG8", "B0000ZG0TA"]}, "price": 34.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 46346}, "asin": "B0001WTWPG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HLFn2G0ML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "NOVA - Origins"}

{"description": "Sixteen seasons (and counting) of pop culture-rocking brilliance, the first four of which have already been gloriously archived on DVD. But in the words of Krusty the Clown: What hasThe Simpsonsdone for me lately? Well, how about all 22 episodes of season 5, each accompanied by commentary, deleted scenes, and other encyclopedic extras that hopelessly devotedSimpsonsfans crave, no, demand? Season 5 is perhaps not as classics-packed as thethirdandfourthseasons, but no self-respectingSimpsonsfan should be without the episodes \"Homer's Barbershop Quartet,\" featuring George Harrison, \"Cape Feare,\" one of Sideshow Bob's (and guest voice Kelsey Grammer's) finest half-hours, \"Rosebud,\" \"Springfield (Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Legalized Gambling),\" and \"Bart Gets Famous,\" with the Springfield-sweeping catchphrase \"I didn't do it.\" Plus, the star power this season is impressive: Michelle Pfeiffer as Homer's comely, donut-loving co-worker in \"The Last Temptation of Homer,\" Albert Brooks as a self-help guru who unleashes \"Bart's Inner Child,\" Kathleen Turner as the creator of Malibu Stacy in \"Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy,\" and, as themselves, the Ramones (\"Rosebud\"), James Woods (\"Homer and Apu\"), Buzz Aldrin (\"Deep Space Homer\"), and even Robert Goulet (\"Springfield\").But it is the writers and the core ensemble cast who exhibit, to quote \"Deep Space Homer,\" \"the right... What's that stuff?\" Series milestones include the first appearance of yokel Cletus in \"Bart Gets an Elephant,\" and Maggie's infant nemesis, The Baby with One Eyebrow in \"Sweet Seymour Skinner's Badasssss Song,\" which also happens to beThe Simpsons' 100th episode. Add in a very good \"Treehouse of Horror\" episode, (which outs Ned Flanders as the Devil and Marge as the head vampire), and one Emmy-nominated musical extravaganza (\"Who Needs the Quick-E-Mart\" from \"Homer and Apu\"), and you have aSimpsonsseason that's not just great, it's DVD-box-set great.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B007KFZ8B4", "B007KFZ7YM", "B007KFZ7Q0", "B007KFZ8AK", "B007KFZ88M", "B007KFZ7UQ", "B007KFZ87S", "B007KFZ7PG", "B007KFZ85K", "B001GQ3GHG", "B000067DNE", "B000BQPC42", "B0024FAR52", "B003KZ27N0", "B005QIOJ3A", "B009DW5YJI", "B001L1S1PI", "B000WGYMGK", "B00F4NPBI4", "B00009N80Z", "0060952520", "B003KZ27NA", "B002R8JE7S", "B000WGYMD8", "B008412UQ4", "B00LBHOCHS", "B00008YGRS", "B00008YGRZ", "B00F4NPBAC", "0061711284", "B006W93ELK", "B0001ZWLVU", "B009DW5X0I", "B0006Z2L2Y", "0060987634", "B0000CABL2", "B00JO5SS7E", "B00023P49C", "B007ZFR67I", "B004MLEYTG", "B00005JM3G", "B004Y6MUFY", "B00K8HAJN8", "B009DW5YA2", "B003DZX46G", "B001O0TWXG", "0060007974", "B0030Y11NS", "B0018O5WUU", "B00023P49M", "B0012018OE", "B004696M94", "B0007PAM06", "B001VFM0ZG", "B005QIOJ6M", "B00008EY6Q", "B000FSME2Y", "B0002XVQT4", "B00JDFTN60", "B000USUA8E", "B008LCRA7K", "B006W93EM4", "B001O9CCP2", "B000HC2LX0", "B000CNESM6", "B000BZISQW", "B0000AGWRT", "B005MQ58WW", "B000KLQUMQ", "B001957A44", "B000AQ68VO", "B00I2YXN5A", "B0030Y11UG", "B00ALTQRFC", "B005QIOJUI", "B001G0MFFG", "B008LCRA98", "B001EOQVA4", "B000ADWCYY", "B00FCCI26U", "B0007XG43W", "B0009VBTP0", "0062267752", "B000P0J06U", "B000EHSVDC", "B009SQ9Y7M", "B003Q7B79M", "B00JNCS59Y", "B008412UKA", "B003ES5JTW", "B000083C6V", "B008FL8OTK", "B008LCRABQ", "B00FMGPVCO", "B0038SUBDC", "B00BUWD7Y8"], "bought_together": ["B007KFZ8B4", "B007KFZ7YM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007KFZ8B4", "B007KFZ7UQ", "B007KFZ85K", "B007KFZ7YM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 41560}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 16.9, "brand": "Simpsons", "asin": "B00020SLO0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515S520D0DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Simpsons - The Complete Fifth Season collector's ed [DVD] [1993]"}

{"description": "Purists may scoff atThe Doors of the 21st Century, but for those who believe in second chances, this concert succeeds as both reunion and revival of one of the greatest rock bands in history. Replacing the late, great Jim Morrison is a daunting task, but the addition of British vocalist Ian Astbury (who bears more than passing resemblance to Morrison) is a risk that pays off surprisingly well during this 102-minute gig, superbly recorded in Houston, Texas, during the band's 2003 world tour. Astbury respects Morrison's legacy, but wisely avoids slavish re-creation of \"the Lizard King\"'s inimitable style; he's paying affectionate tribute while channeling his own vocal energy into Morrison's poetry. In performing the entirety of the Doors' classicL.A. Womanalong with other timeless hits, keyboardist Ray Manzarek and guitarist Robby Krieger (drummer John Densmore moved on to a variety of solo projects; he's replaced here by Ty Dennis) make good on a 32-year-old promise to give Doors fans the tour that Morrison's death pre-empted, adding what the Doors never officially had: a bass player (Angelo Barbera) to re-create the LP's rhythm section. The band's in excellent form here, so let the naysayers whine; this DVD proves that new Doors are better than no Doors at all.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005IB9H", "B000MCIBAW", "B00CZAYOWI", "B000MG1ZG0", "B000MCIBE8", "B003H5WF3U", "B0053TWVFA", "0783233485", "B00GSGT7G8", "B00005UM2K", "B0002CTSXQ", "B00000K29Y", "B000F48D00", "B000065OND", "B000F8O49A", "B000N3SUB0", "B0009V6FJU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0090O07S2", "B005DJ62MS", "B003H5WF3U", "0425170454"]}, "price": 11.88, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Metal"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Vocal Pop"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 124053}, "asin": "B0002A2W3Q", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RNZWWWF7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Doors of the 21st Century - L.A.

{"description": "TheBabylon 5pilot movieThe Gatheringwas originally broadcast in 1993 a full year ahead of the regular show. A somewhat dull tale of an attempt to assassinate Koch, the Vorlon ambassador toB5, the feature served to introduce Commander Jeffery Sinclair (Michael O'Hare) and Security Chief Michael Garibaldi (Jerry Doyle) as well as familiarize the audience with the unique environment of a five-mile-long space station in the year 2257. Missing many of the main cast, and suffering from a leaden pace and mediocre music score, series creator J Michael Straczynski later improvedThe Gatheringby tightening the cut for a special edition (the version released on DVD), adding some deleted character moments and commissioning a new score from series composer Christopher Franke.Four new TV movies were part of the deal to syndicateBabylon 5.In the Beginningis a prelude set 10 years beforeBabylon 5, telling the story of the Earth-Minbari war. Told retrospectively, many of the mysteries revealed gradually in the main series are recounted, making the show a collection of spoilers for newcomers while adding little for established fans. It is effective to see events only previously talked about, and enjoyable to have most of the main cast playing younger versions of themselves.River of Soulsis a self-contained adventure featuring a return of the Soul Hunters from Season One, whileThirdspaceoffers a spectacular Lovecraftian space opera which slots into the saga after the end of the Shadow War.A Call to Armsis the most important of the TV films, laying the ground for the future TV seriesCrusade. Set five years after the Shadow War, it tells the story of a Drahk revenge attack on Earth.

{"description": "Billed as \"the greatestSurvivorever\" when it launched following the Super Bowl in January 2004,Survivor All-Starsbroke new ground for the hit reality series by bringing back 18 of its most famous (and infamous) characters from the previous seven installments to battle it out in a quest for affirmation or redemption (and, of course, the million-dollar prize).  Half the fun was seeing who was picked to return, and there were many tasty selections: original winner Richard (natch) from Borneo; Colby, Jerri, and Tina from the Australian Outback; Ethan, Lex, and Big Tom from Africa; and the newest alumnus, Rupert from the just-completed Pearl Islands.  (There were, of course, many omissions, such as Mike Skupin, who deserved a second chance after falling into the fire in Australia.)Right from the beginning, it was clear that thisSurvivorwas going to be different. Because people now knew each other (from sharing a previous game, watching on TV, or mixing atSurvivor-related functions), some of the schemers were quickly sniffed out and snuffed out, and players were more aggressive about creating alliances (which sometimes overlapped, but hey, it's only a problem if you get caught).  In addition, because no one wanted to see someone win a second million dollars, previous champions found that they had targets on their backs. As a result, there was an entirely new wave of power players.  Along the way there were some surprising and very emotional developments (which had the unfortunate side effect of killing some of the show's action) and the first on-screenSurvivorromance.  In the end,Survivor All-Starsdidn't live up to its billing as the best ever (that title would remain withseason 2 in the Australian Outback), but it did bring a new twist and some genuinely memorable moments to a long-running series.The DVD set adds significant value to the season, including some welcome behind-the-scenes info on the series as a whole. The bonus footage consists of  much longer versions of each member's \"confessional\" after being voted out,  and 57 minutes of scenes that are edited and scored like the regular  episodes.  Among those scenes are a tribal council that was never  seen on TV and Rob Cesternino's dead-on impression of host Jeff Probst at a  mock tribal council, which was seen during the season as new footage in the  midseason \"recap\" episode.  That episode is the only one not included in  the set, but with the above-mentioned moment preserved, only the most  hardcore fan would object to the loss of this dead spot in every season.   Three different quartets of cast members recorded commentary tracks on a  total of 10 episodes, including the final four on the last episode and the first reunion (the second is also included).  They provide a lot of insight and fun stories, though there's a bit too much yelling over each other.   There are also featurettes that should appeal to all fans of the show: how the challenges are created and tested, the casting process, behind the scenes at the final show, and TV promos for the previous seven seasons.  The individual profiles of all 16 All-Stars consist of footage of their original appearances, which may help remind you why they were picked to return, and interviews before the the season started.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BTGY2I", "B000FSME38", "B0007TKGVC", "B000HWZ4M0", "B005FRACYM", "B00005JOAQ", "B0001ZDKXI", "B007PK88HA", "B007PK88AW", "B004DNXIHM", "B000Q7ZOMQ", "B000N6TYQC", "B00GHXYN52", "B00GHXYKV4", "B000BDGW94", "B00KGKDXQW", "B00KGKDWR2", "B00005N89A", "B000A6T1JK", "B00C3MOUQI", "0989338622", "B008R4LHJ4", "B005Y3SR8A", "B007HPNIL4", "B005Y3SR0S", "B007HPMODM", "B004D4Y3IE", "1933771054", "B00KHB3GSK", "B008R4LNPM", "B00C3MOUIG", "B0028LJDB6", "B00KHB3H5W", "B00I5YB6N8", "B000QHH9CY", "B00I5YBJ5S", "B0049488NO", "B0001A7UZW", "1575001438", "B00004WHR4", "1937061914", "B000050XQO", "B003HOJ27S", "1468150979", "B00009QMRP", "0312284217", "B003G71666", "B00284G2B2", "B002N5N4K8", "B0000D1FJ9", "B000ATQYSS", "B00AL3HHWA", "1480800171", "B004B93RFG", "B004OTQNJ0", "B00EJSMP20", "B0002CX1WA", "B00DP1D8NM", "B005IQGNHK", "B00013RC34", "B0051O0NIE", "B00I9KW95M", "B000UNYJT0", "0142424242", "B003ONTVDW", "B001D0T4IU", "B00HW3EXCE", "B0016QNSC4", "B001DJ7PXM", "B0064S91MK", "B000F0V0KY", "B00ESFYY78", "B0014E6424", "0142424269", "B0007QJ1XE", "0142424250", "0547974957", "B003UD7JC6"], "bought_together": ["B000BTGY2I", "B000FSME38"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BTGY2I", "B0007TKGVC", "B00005JOAQ", "B000FSME38"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 21267}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.33, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B0002ERWV4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515KA36DFCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Survivor All-Stars - The Complete Season"}

{"description": "Season 2 of the cult science-fiction seriesRoswellopens on a promisingly positive note, with the rescue of alien teen Michael (Brendan Fehr) by Max (Jason Behr) and his pals, but as soon as things settled down, new challenges threaten their existence. That was par for the course on this imaginative program, which hit its stride in its sophomore year (2000-2001) with a tighter blend of thoughtful youth drama and otherworldly action. The season's chief threats to aliens Max, Michael, Isabel (Katherine Heigl ofGrey's Anatomy), and newcomer Tess (Emilie De Ravin ofLost), and Earthlings Liz (Shiri Appleby), Maria (Majandra Delfino), and Alex (Colin Hanks) are Vanessa Whitaker (Gretchen Egolf), a congresswoman with a very sinister secret agenda, and Brody Davis (Desmond Askew), the new curator of Roswell's UFO Museum, who harbors an equally unpleasant plan for the friends. The struggle between human and alien forces, both good and evil, to uncover the truth about Max and his companions leads to a pair of shocking events--a death among the group, and in the season finale, Max, Michael, and Isabel's possible return to their home planet. Other highlights from season 2 include the imaginative period piece \"Summer of '47,\" with the series regulars assuming the roles of townspeople and government officials at the time of the original alleged UFO crash; the two-parter \"Meet the Dupes\" and \"Max in the City,\" which poses the alien quartet against their physically identical doubles (with extremely different personalities); and \"A Roswell Christmas Carol,\" which offers an unsentimental retake on the Dickens story.As with the first-season set, supplemental features are surprisingly abundant for a relatively minor show; commentary is included on three of the 21 episodes (two by executive producer Ron Moore), while the featurette \"Here with Me\" has the writers, producers, and cast offering their opinions on the season. There's also another installment of the \"Shiri and Majandra Show,\" with more lighthearted reminiscences from the actresses, as well as two additional featurettes on the program's score and the process of transforming a storyboarded scene into filmed action. A five-minute montage of clips set to music called \"A Little Something Extra for the Fans\" is the lightest of all the extras (and fans should note that many of the music cues featured in the original broadcasts have been replaced in this set), butRoswellaficionados will undoubtedly be happy with everything they get.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00133QNSG", "B00133QNRW", "B000NOKFGW", "B00005YU87", "B001ILFUB4", "B002QZDSW4", "B000O77SN6", "B000FJH5M2", "B0001907BC", "B0009A407A", "B000092T3Y", "B0009JE6FC", "B000F3UAE8", "B000O77SMW", "B00008AOX3", "B0002XVKMM", "B00177YA10", "B00JF5G8WU", "B00IWTVDUW", "B000FOPPBA", "B00166UFTI", "B000OCXNQW", "B0011FLGZQ", "B0000E5NPY", "B003R0MF6W", "B000AO9BSS", "B0002234R2", "B002JVWR4U", "0671035649", "B001MVWRNO", "B000EHSVKK", "B0051GOB2G", "B0006J28DW", "B001MVWRNE", "B00HQOFAKI", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B000I0QLR8", "B0077PTWHI", "B000QDLSR0", "B00022FWEU", "B001MVWRN4", "B001MVWRMU", "B00HUPC5X8", "B00005JM39", "B00127RAGM", "B0007V6IW6", "B000I0QLS2", "B000VSDNFA", "B0001I55S8", "B000EHSVLE", "B000BNXD6O", "B00JF5GAZA", "B004SMDJ9U", "B0077PTWY6", "B002BWP2IK", "B00GHH9IAI", "B00GHH9HBI", "0671035614", "B0002RQ3MK", "B002HMTX84", "B000EHSVL4", "B000EAT23C", "B001CQONMC", "B00152R4VK", "B00JK47BHM", "B0024FAR66", "B004YPED14", "B008X6N8KW", "B006LG74Q0", "B000I0QLQY", "B000YDOOEQ", "B00GQQ75QO", "B003L77GWE", "B0001IN0T4", "B004GJYRFA", "B00AMDA2QC", "B000CNE0T2", "B0009JE6G6", "B008H1Q61G", "B0012Z36F8", "B000EHSVM8", "B0024FAD9C", "B00BGQ2NIO", "B00DPJEWD4", "B000EHSVMS", "B000I0QLRI", "B00B5ARKC0", "B001MVWRMK", "B00GOC74I4", "B005DCJ0Q0", "B000J10KKA", "B008JFUS0U", "B004LROMWU", "B000BOH990", "B0037AGB9O", "B0011UBDS6", "B00BGI086Q", "B000FL7CAK", "B001ILFUA0", "B00G6HO4O4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00133QNRW", "B00133QNSG", "B000NOKFGW", "B000JJ6K0Q"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 124380}, "asin": "B0002PYT7I", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511BBPPKGWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Roswell - The Complete Second Season"}

{"description": "When a movie can blend passionate social concern with good old-fashioned suspense, it must be doing something right.Maria Full of Gracescores high on both counts. Maria is a Colombian teenager who, for a large paycheck, agrees to be a mule for drug-runners:  she has to swallow dozens of thumb-sized capsules of heroin and smuggle them into New York. This debilitating process is painstakingly described, and of course not everything goes as planned when Maria and her fellow mules land in America. Director Joshua Marston is working on a low budget, which explains the film's narrow, single-minded focus--but this may be a strength, not a weakness. The trump card is the lead performance of Catalina Sandrino Moreno, who won awards at the Seattle and Newport Film Festivals. Her empathetic face carries us along on Maria's journey, and humanizes a problem that is too easily relegated to a headline.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002FHGESI", "B00005JNCZ", "B0041KKYF6", "B000N3T0DW", "B00080Z53O", "B000O76ZQC", "B00005N8A9", "B00180IPM6", "B00008AOX5", "B0036TGSJE", "B008S2NABI", "B000YIGNCC", "B0007NBJHI", "B0042EJDGM", "B000RHRGSK", "B00AZMFKXK", "B005HFI7IU", "B000LV6OC6", "B00005JL57", "B0015ET3YO", "B003A0T8BO", "B004XVMCMG", "B000WC38IC", "B002M2T1VI", "B000N3SU6K", "B001ILTUKQ", "B0052LE7C4", "B005FIXA6S", "B002E01LOI", "B00GJNQ3S0", "B0047685T6", "B00075VX2C", "B00005JLQW", "B000AM4P90", "B001UV4XC4", "B004SIP7S0", "B00006G8G3", "B004SIP6GI", "B00005LZOD", "B0011FLH14", "B004MNM1FI", "B002M2T1V8", "B0086900LG", "B002BWP3UC", "B00E5G03KM", "B000AYEIDQ", "B00134PSV8", "B001FOPOD8", "B0000AMU29", "B00003CXRG", "B0014BQR6U", "B000274TLW", "B000LXHFMW", "B0000C9JFO", "B0001CNQX0", "B00004U1FA", "B00E1S1MMM", "B007961SAE", "B000GETTJI", "B004IF4EVY", "B00F6Y3E26", "B0032AJVE6", "B003O3EKRO", "B003X3BYJM", "B0009HLC9W", "B0000714BS", "B00000F5KH", "B002VECLXC", "B0000714BQ", "B0009S4IGK", "B002FUI4CE", "B00006BS7S", "B00APUAKYG", "B000K2V7F0", "B000SLYE6M", "0764146076", "B0000A2ZTY", "B0002VEZ3U", "1444137697", "B001M5BF7Y", "B000KJU15U", "B001Q56XOA", "B001QX014A", "0070020698", "B001S400C0", "B000VXUW0E", "B00H1RMPH6", "B000QYKDFC", "B000067IZ3", "B000JBXH78", "B00IQIAL8Y", "B007L6VPXC", "B0051T46YG", "B0002DRDIW", "B002EZLPOO", "B000N3T0DM", "B0002RQ316", "B0000U0X20", "B0013HL6ES"], "bought_together": ["B000O76ZQC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00180IPM6", "B0036TGSJE", "B005HFI7IU", "B000O76ZQC"]}, "price": 4.09, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3577}, "asin": "B0002TT0MI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51o4PdGtr3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Maria Full of Grace"}

{"description": "Homicide's sixth season begins with a bang. Three-part premiere \"Blood Ties\" represents the Peabody Award-winning drama at its best. The ambitious story arc introduces a case that will pit the detectives against a prominent Maryland family--and each other. The Wilson family includes Lt. Giardello's friend, Felix (James Earl Jones), his loyal wife (Lynne Thigpen), and his wayward son (Jeffrey Wright). By the time the case is put to rest, everyone involved will have lost more than they've gained. On the plus side, Pembleton (Andre Braugher) has another baby on the way and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) is about to embark on a relationship--with Dr. Cox (Michelle Forbes).More changes are on the way. Characters introduced in season 5 will become regulars in season 6: Laura Ballard (Callie Thorne), Stuart Gharty (Peter Gerety), and Paul Falsone (Jon Seda). Culture clashes will commence the moment they step into the squad room. But some things never change andHomicidewill continue to boast some of the best acting, writing, and directing on network television. Another standout episode, \"The Subway,\" featuring Vincent D'Onofrio, would even become the focus of a PBS special,Anatomy of a Homicide, which is included with this collection.The biggest story arc will last the entire season. The squad may have thought that the shooting of Luther Mahoney marked the end of his reign, but they were wrong. Luther had followers, like his steely sister, Georgia Rae (Hazelle Goodman), and her loose-cannon son, Junior (Mekhi Phifer). Kellerman (Reed Diamond) will continue to be dogged by rumors that the shoot wasn't \"clean,\" and the other detectives will start to abandon him, even former flame Cox and ex-partner Lewis (Clark Johnson). The sixth season ofHomicidewould turn out to be the last for Forbes, Diamond, and Emmy Award-winner Braugher.--Kathleen C.

I can do all those in my truck.\" The decadent air of Ron White darkens the show: \"If I'd known the difference between 'antidote' and 'anecdote,' my friend would still be alive today.\" Foxworthy, the likable Everyman, comments on his wife's hypochondria: \"Honey, you do not have testicular cancer.\" Finally, Larry the Cable Guy lowers the bar on sick-hick humor but does score occasionally: \"I got a vasectomy at Sears.

{"description": "Something the Lord Maderecounts the relationship between Dr. Alfred Blalock (Alan Rickman) and Vivian Thomas (Mos Def). It begins in 1930s Nashville when imperious cardiac surgeon Blalock hires Thomas, an African American carpenter, as his janitor. When the latter reveals a passion for medicine and facility with surgical instruments, Blalock promotes him to lab tech. Thomas isn't given a raise, works side jobs to make ends meet, and is expected to be grateful. Along the way, he follows Blalock from Vanderbilt to Johns Hopkins, where they save thousands of lives through their pioneering work, but will Thomas ever get any credit? The film provides a satisfying answer to that question. Joseph Sargent (A Lesson Before Dying) directs with subtlety and intelligence, while Rickman and Mos Def are in top form, often underplaying where most actors would do otherwise.Something the Lord Madewon the 2004 Emmy for outstanding made-for-TV movie.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Lives were upended--and some co-opted--in the fifth and final season ofAngel, as the denizens of Angel Investigations found themselves taking on one of their scariest endeavors ever: corporate life. After making a literal deal with the devil (or something distinctly devil-like), Angel (David Boreanaz) moved his team from their crumbling hotel to the high-rise digs of law-firm-from-hell Wolfram & Hart, his reasoning being they could better fight the forces of evil from the inside, and with more resources to boot. Clever maneuvering or easy rationalization? Not a few members of Angel's team accused him of selling out (as did a number of viewers), but as with most of the show's previous four seasons,Angelsomehow took a dubious premise and mined it for gold. And with one core cast member gone (Charisma Carpenter, whose Cordelia was immersed in a deep coma), it seemed as if the show, from within and without, would suddenly fall apart--that is, until Angel's longtime nemesis Spike (James Marsters) showed up, fresh from his sacrificial roasting at the series finale ofBuffy the Vampire Slayer. Let the vampire games begin!WithBuffyoff the air, fans flocked toAngel's last season to get their fix of Joss Whedon's \"Buffyverse\" in any form they could, and the addition of Spike was a shrewd one, albeit not enough to keep the show from getting canceled. And for the first half of the season, the creative forces behind the show seemed to be toying ruthlessly with the audience. Spike was around, but not entirely corporeal; Angel himself became sullen and withdrawn; and most horrifically, sweetheart scientist Fred (Amy Acker) and former watcher Wesley (Alexis Denisof) underwent traumas that would test even the most devoted viewer. However, just when you'd be about to throw in the towel, things started changing for the better--Spike became a permanent fixture (both in the flesh and on the show), Angel's secret motives were revealed, and the introduction of demon warrior Illyria, who proved to be the show's answer toBuffy's sardonic demon-made-human Anya, was a welcome breath of fresh air.  Creatively,Angelalso came up with some of its best episodes, including \"Smile Time\" (where Angel is turned into a puppet &#x96; really!) and \"You're Welcome\" (the show's 100th episode, which marked the bittersweet return of Carpenter's Cordelia). The ending of the series was deliberately ambiguous, and not everyone made it through alive, but in going out kicking, it was a proper sendoff for a show that always fought the good fight.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000I0QLRS", "B000I0QLRI", "B000I0QLR8", "B000I0QLQY", "B000EHSVM8", "B000EHSVN2", "B000EHSVMS", "B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVLE", "B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVKK", "B0006IUE16", "B0009W5J4Q", "B007H9CNOI", "B000B5XOW0", "B000CCBCGM", "B0046XG48O", "B00AMDA2QC", "B00006J3WH", "B001L1S1OY", "B000ERVJM2", "B002JVWR4A", "B001992NWO", "B009LDD4V4", "B00HUPC5X8", "B000JLTRIG", "1593078226", "B000X5SPBI", "B000GG4Y6O", "B0000AQS0F", "B000RO6JYK", "B0024FAR66", "B002JVWR4U", "B000OIOPHC", "B000HT3P60", "B000BOH990", "B00AMDA2P8", "B00HR736AA", "B002JVWRAO", "B0053O89IS", "B00133QNS6", "B00JF5GAZA", "B009LDCXNY", "B000BOH98G", "B002N5N5MK", "B001FB4W0C", "B000BOH986", "B000FIMG68", "B0009JE6FC", "B006LG74Q0", "B00008KA59", "B000A5045Q", "B003L77G8I", "B0016QNSGA", "B002CLKP00", "B004YM6JI2", "B001MVWRMU", "1595826106", "B001QE99AQ", "B0024FAD9C", "B000CNE0SS", "B000FP2OPY", "B00008KA57", "B001B7CNZ6", "B0085KGG96", "B009LDD5XQ", "159307963X", "B000HD1482", "B003BV8I7C", "B000F8O2PG", "B00006FD9N", "B00008KGT0", "B003L77GGK", "B000EMG922", "6302020190", "B00020H9NO", "B000OCY7TY", "B000B8I9ZO", "B000LE1798", "B0053O8A46", "B0000959N0", "B00133QNSG", "B000EXDS3E", "B000CNE0T2", "B0009ZE9Y4", "1569717516", "B000R7GKQE", "B00BBXSPES", "B003L77G6U", "B0011FLGZQ", "B000BUE5D2", "B00HVJKAMG", "B00HQQ7KCC", "B002BWP2BW", "B001MVWRMK", "B004LWZW42", "B00001R3O1", "B00IWTVDUW", "B0002Y0QV2", "B001MVWRN4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000I0QLR8", "B000I0QLRS", "B000I0QLQY", "B000I0QLRI"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 91567}, "asin": "B0006GAO54", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MHX7XV3QL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Angel - Season Five"}

{"description": "The highly acclaimed, award-winning Turkish filmDistantis a deeply compassionate and frequently amusing study of quiet desperation, prompting many critics to favorably compare writer-director Nuri Bilge Ceylan's subtly hypnotic drama to the films of Ozu and Tarkovsky. Watch closely and you'll recognize someone you know, or even yourself, and the quietest moments are the most enjoyably revealing. Muzaffer &#xD6;zdemir and Mehmet Emin Toprak shared Best Actor honors at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival for their perfectly nuanced performances as (respectively) divorced, 40-something photographer Mahmut and his distant relative Yusef, who arrives in Istanbul looking for work, and quickly wears out his welcome. Tensions mount, revealing solitude as the natural (if not preferred) state of these lonely, melancholy men. (In the context of this film, it's tragically ironic that Toprak was killed in an auto accident, at age 28, six months before his honors at Cannes.) With understated humor, Ceylan observes Mahmut and Yusef's chronic isolation, but he never passes judgment.Distantcould've been made anywhere and it would yield the same visually seductive study of detachment.

{"description": "If you spliced Charles Addams, Dr. Seuss, Charles Dickens, Edward Gorey, and Roald Dahl into a Tim Burtonesque landscape, you'd surely come up with something likeLemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events. Many critics (in mostly mixed reviews) wondered why Burton didn't direct this comically morbid adaptation of thefirst three booksin the popular series by Daniel Handler (a.k.a. \"Lemony Snicket,\" played here by Jude Law and seen only in silhouette) instead of TV andCasperveteran Brad Silberling, but there's still plenty to recommend the playfully bleak scenario, in which three resourceful orphans thwart their wicked, maliciously greedy relative Count Olaf (Jim Carrey), who subjects them to... well, a series of unfortunate events. Along the way they encounter a herpetologist uncle (Billy Connolly), an anxious aunt (Meryl Streep) who's afraid ofeverything, and a variety of fantastical hazards and mysterious clues, some of which remain unresolved. Given endless wonders of art direction, costume design, and cinematography, Silberling's direction is surprisingly uninspired (in other words, the books are better), but when you add a throwaway cameo by Dustin Hoffman, Law's amusing narration, and Carrey's over-the-top antics, the firstLemonymovie suggests a promising franchise in the making.--Jeff ShannonA Message from Count OlafDear Adoring Fan of Count Olaf,Perhaps once every thousand years, a talent emerges that completely changes the way movies are made, orphans are orphaned, and heartthrobs throb. Often this talent has only one eyebrow, as is the case with one of the most cherished and admired actors scheming today. Surely you can you guess of whom I think.No, you fool! I am referring to the One...the Only...the Unbelievably Handsome Count Olaf!Or, as I like to call him, Me.If you&#x92;ve already seen my performance in Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, you must still be speechless. But if you haven&#x92;t, you are in serious danger. Just teasing. But you could be after I send one of my gifted henchpersons to your home!So why not get my movie on DVD? This major motion spectacle has everything. Me, acting! Leeches, attacking! Orphans, almost falling off a cliff!

{"description": "The Complete James Dean Collectionincludes two-disc special editions of the three major films Dean made during his meteoric career:East of Eden(1955, never before available on DVD),Rebel Without a Cause(1955), andGiant(1956).  In addition to new transfers, the films collect new and vintage documentaries, commentary tracks, publicity materials, and even the infamous \"Drive Safely\" commercial spot Dean filmed shortly before his death in an auto accident.East of Edenis an acknowledged classic, and the starring debut of James Dean lifts it to legendary status. John Steinbeck's novel gave director Elia Kazan a perfect Cain-and-Abel showcase for Dean's iconic screen persona, casting the brooding star as Cal, the younger of two brothers vying for the love of their Bible-thumping father (Raymond Massey) in Monterey, California, at the dawn of World War I. Massey is a lettuce farmer, striving for market domination with an ill-fated refrigeration scheme. Having discovered that his presumed-dead mother (Oscar winner Jo Van Fleet) is a brothel owner in nearby Salinas, Cal convinces her to finance an investment that will restore his father's lost fortune, but neither money nor the tenderness of his brother's fianc&#xE9;e (Julie Harris) can assuage Cal's anguished need for paternal acceptance that comes nearly too late. Kazan's oblique camera angles and Dean's tortured emoting may seem extreme by latter-day standards, but their theatrics makeEast of Edena timeless tale of family secrets and hard-won affection.When people think of James Dean, they probably think first of the troubled teen fromRebel Without a Cause: nervous, volatile, soulful, a kid lost in a world that does not understand him. Made between his only other starring roles, inEast of EdenandGiant,Rebelsums up the jangly, alienated image of Dean, but also happens to be one of the key films of the 1950s. Director Nicholas Ray takes a strikingly sympathetic look at the teenagers standing outside the white-picket-fence '50s dream of America: juvenile delinquent (that's what they called them then) Jim Stark (Dean), fast girl Judy (Natalie Wood), lost boy Plato (Sal Mineo), slick hot-rodder Buzz (Corey Allen). At the time, it was unusual for a movie to endorse the point of view of teenagers, but Ray and screenwriter Stewart Stern captured the youthful angst that was erupting at the same time in rock & roll. Dean is heartbreaking, following the method acting style of Marlon Brando but staking out a nakedly emotional honesty of his own. Going too fast, in every way, he was killed in a car crash on September 30, 1955, a month beforeRebelopened. He was no longer an actor, but an icon, andRebelis a lasting monument.Giantgot its name because everything in the picture is big, from the generous running time (more than 200 minutes) to the sprawling ranch location (a horizon-to-horizon plain with a lonely, modest mansion dropped in the middle) to the high-powered stars. Stocky Rock Hudson stars as the confident, stubborn young ranch baron Bick Benedict, who woos and wins the hand of Southern belle Elizabeth Taylor, a seemingly demure young beauty who proves to be Hudson's match after she settles into the family homestead. For many the film is chiefly remembered for James Dean's final performance, as poor former ranch hand Jett Rink, who strikes oil and transforms himself into a flamboyant millionaire playboy. Director George Stevens won his second Oscar for this ambitious, grandly realized (if sometimes slow moving) epic of the changing socioeconomic (and physical) landscape of modern Texas, based on Edna Ferber's bestselling novel. The talented supporting cast includes Mercedes McCambridge as Bick's frustrated sister, put out by the new \"woman of the house\"; Chill Wills as the Benedicts' garrulous rancher neighbor; Carroll Baker and Dennis Hopper as the Benedicts' rebellious children; and Earl Holliman and Sal Mineo as dedicated ranch hands.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B007TBJUVS", "B000MV9O5O", "B0009XT7ZM", "B000LM4W9M", "0446516430", "B0009XT7ZC", "B001JDADR2", "B0009X77GS", "B001NG8BEM", "0956494277", "B004XKVP7K", "1940287014", "0756609348", "B00003CXBU", "B009ELWC3O", "B00C1LIZI0", "B001LPWGGY", "B0009IXRJ4", "B000063US2", "B0019UGYK0", "B00003CXBZ", "B000EBD9T4", "B00421A7G0", "B000TXP56M", "B00079Z9VO", "B003LMPKSQ", "B0045HCJ8U", "B000P2A22O", "B00AEFY9GW", "B000UPMZ30", "B004CQZFH6", "B0014VK86U", "B0007TKNHE", "B0000DJZ8R", "B000Y3FTDQ", "155652398X", "B000063UQP", "0767818172", "B0000AM6IY", "B0074JOVUU", "B0050FXDDQ", "B0008ENID4", "B001LMU1C8", "B002VWNIAY", "B007N31YH0", "1465010939", "B002M2Z3BA", "B00006FDAU", "B001IHJ97O", "B0007MAO0C", "B00005AUKC", "B004H83ILY", "B0008ENHV2", "B00008MTW0", "B00066FBQG", "B006FE83UE", "B00008MTW2", "B000ECX0O2", "B0072BNJZ8", "B00BTYU3ZS", "B000FUH38C", "B00004XPPC", "B00441GYOM", "B00GHP8SH4", "B00004TX2E", "B0007US7FI", "B0000549B1", "B000EHSVOG", "B004QBWU02", "B00AEFXV3E", "B0008JGQN8", "B000FFJYAW", "B0012KSUTK", "B00AWQEK26", "B00070HK24", "B0045HCJ9E", "1555976735", "B001989ZF8", "B002GSXKQA", "B0002Y4TNI", "B003UN2IAY", "B00DNQM7N6", "B009WHDEQO", "B0045HCIZE", "B0000JBALO", "B0000CBY1C", "B00AEFYL6K", "B00001W9G0", "B0047BXQZY", "B0008ENHUI", "B00I2U91Z0", "B00AEBB9F0"], "bought_together": ["B007TBJUVS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007US7EY", "B0007US7FI", "B001KXZGO6", "B007TBJUVS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 16747}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.7, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0007TKNK6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516QFT9GNJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Complete James Dean Collection (East of Eden / Giant / Rebel Without a Cause Special Edition)"}

{"description": "Lois & Clarkwas one of the sweetest surprises of the 1993 television season, and while it certainly enjoyed a devoted following until the series jumped the tall building in its later years, we can probably thank the Phoenix-like rise ofDesperate Housewives' Teri Hatcher's career to thank for its arrival on DVD. The premise ofLois & Clarkis one fraught with peril, particularly for core fans. This incarnation of the Man of Steel saga recastsSupermanas romantic comedy. One of the series creators once described this series as \"basically,Moonlighting, only Bruce Willis can fly.\" This is overstating the case by leaps and bounds. Clark Kent (Dean Cain) has not been reinvented as a wisecracking street-wise hipster. The chemistry between the new Metropolis arrival and rookieDaily Planetscribe and ace investigative reporter Lois Lane (Hatcher) is not as sexually charged as David and Maddie, and their banter is not as sharp. But as withMoonlightingit would be a few seasons before the two lovelorn characters consummated their attraction.The dramatic arc of this inaugural season is \"the fall of the house of Luthor,\" but at its heart is the triangle between Clark, Lois, and the charming snake Lex Luthor (John Shea), who, in the pilot episode, Superman vows to bring to justice (\"Let the games begin,\" Luthor responds). Further complicating matters is that Superman has literally swept Lois off her feet. But until the episode \"Barbarians at the Planet,\" in which Lex proposes to Lois, Lois professes her love to Superman, and Clark confesses his love to Lois,Lois & Clarkbreezily tweaks the touchstones ofSupermaniconography. \"I've never noticed it before,\" a \"drunk with love\" Lois observes to a bespectacled Clark in \"Pheremone, My Lovely,\" \"You look a lot like Superman.\" Though special effects have progressed since the 1990s,Lois & Clarkhas lost little of its sparkle and panache, thanks to its super leads, whose fledgling careers soared to dizzying new heights.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BT96EG", "B00BBXSPES", "B00BBXSPCK", "B000EU1Q2M", "B00AKK6MD4", "B004EXWGJW", "B000HWZ4E8", "B00LT1JHLW", "B000I8OM94", "B00G7QPX6C", "B00DX88IL4", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B000A5046K", "B001FB4VZS", "B0002Y0QV2", "B00005JLKB", "B000X5SMXY", "B000G1R4SO", "B002JVWRDQ", "B000BT96FA", "B0001JXPPC", "B000N6SE4U", "B003L77GG0", "B0009A5MUO", "B000J10EQU", "B001FB4W02", "B003L77GGA", "B002JVWRE0", "B000SMNL92", "B000OPODNQ", "B0000C237S", "B002K0WBDM", "B000ION23U", "B0012U7IWU", "B005G5NPD8", "B000093W4T", "B000A2X3T8", "B002LWJ510", "B00HFWETQW", "B000P6XQ50", "B001MVWRNE", "B000B7QCGS", "B002LFPBKQ", "B000R206FK", "B0039ZBM3W", "B0001ZMWYG", "B000AJJNIQ", "B0000CBXZ6", "B0000CBXZ5", "B0007US79Y", "0761504826", "B0039ZBM1O", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B0002NY81C", "B004XWLN20", "B000F4RH8E", "B0002W4SWW", "B0080QOKHU", "B00BGI086Q", "B0002ZMHX6", "B00022FWEU", "1401238246", "B0029WGIDK", "B00HMOW9YM", "B000CSTK42", "B00005JM3A", "B000EYK4H6", "B001OD8E4G", "B000LE178Y", "B0009W5J4Q", "B000GYI336", "B00E5G03I4", "B0016QNSGA", "B00J49R0ZQ", "B0015XWU9A", "B00HUPC5QU", "B0049IHWYG", "B003YJFALS", "B00344EAG4", "B00HMOWA0A", "B003L77FWU", "B003W5C0TY", "B00DYEN6XC", "B0030VANIU", "B001DJLD2G", "B003XL6EI0", "B000CQM4YM", "B000IJ79UW", "B001MVWLYY", "B004EPZ07K", "B004P7CN3G", "B003L77FYS", "B001B23ED6", "B0009KQP96", "B0006GAOP4", "B000EPFCXQ", "B00008ZL4Q", "B000IJ79X4", "B008JFUPFI", "B0053O89KG"], "bought_together": ["B000BT96EG", "B00BBXSPES"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BBXSPES", "B000BT96EG", "B00BBXSPCK", "B000HWZ4BG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 20935}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.57, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00080ZG2O", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510r8P8kLIL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman: Season 1"}
{"description": "From Hollywood's legendary Cocoanut Grove to the pioneering conquest of the wild blue yonder, Martin Scorsese'sThe Aviatorcelebrates old-school filmmaking at its finest. We say \"old school\" only because Scorsese's love of golden-age Hollywood is evident in his approach to his subject--Howard Hughes in his prime (played by Leonardo DiCaprio in his)--and especially in his technical mastery of the medium reflecting his love for classical filmmaking of the studio era. Even when he's using state-of-the-art digital trickery for the film's exciting flight scenes (including one of the most spectacular crashes ever filmed), Scorsese's meticulous attention to art direction and costume design suggests an impassioned pursuit of craftsmanship from a bygone era; every frame seems to glow with gilded detail. And while DiCaprio bears little physical resemblance to Hughes during the film's 20-year span (late 1920s to late '40s), he efficiently captures the eccentric millionaire's golden-boy essence, and his tragic descent into obsessive-compulsive seclusion. Bolstered by Cate Blanchett's uncannily accurate portrayal of Katharine Hepburn as Hughes' most beloved lover,The Aviatoris easily Scorsese's most accessible film, inviting mainstream popularity without compromising Scorsese's artistic reputation. As compelling crowd-pleasers go, it's a class act from start to finish.--Jeff ShannonDVD FeaturesIn his commentary track, director Martin Scorsese offers his own impressions of Howard Hughes and rattles off his memories of experiencing Hughes's films.  He mentions how he made Cate Blanchett watch every Katharine Hepburn film from the '30s on the big screen, and observes that Kate Beckinsale had \"a real sense of the stature of a Hollywood goddess.\"  But in general he doesn't talk much about the craft of making the film.  That area is covered better by editor Thelma Schoonmaker, who also appears on the commentary track, and producer Michael Mann makes a few appearances (all were recorded separately).  The picture is brilliant, but the 5.1 sound is not as aggressive in the rear speakers and subwoofer as one might expect, other than some nice surround effects in theHell's Angelsflying sequence.The second disc collects almost three hours of features.  There's one unnecessary deleted scene, and an 11-minute making-of featurette that's basically the cast and director heaping praise on each other.  More interesting are the short featurettes on visual effects (including the XF-11 scene, of course), production design, costumes, hair and makeup, and score, and Loudon Wainwright discusses his and his children's musical performances.  Historical perspective is provided by spotlights on Hughes's role in aviation and his obsessive-compulsive disorder, and a 43-minute Hughes documentary from the History Channel (part of the Modern Marvels series, it focuses on his mechanical innovations and spends less than a minute on his movies).  More unusual are DiCaprio and Scorsese's appearance on an OCD panel, and a half-hour interview segment DiCaprio did with Alan Alda.--David HoriuchiThe Personalities ofThe AviatorClick the links to explore more movies by these stars.Leonardo DiCaprioasHoward Hughes\"Sometimes I truly fear that I... am losing my mind.

{"description": "Fans of Christina Ricci will note that the saucer-eyed actress takes a big leap from deadpan-child and grumpy-ingenue roles withProzac Nation, an adaptation of Elizabeth Wurtzel's bestselling book. Ricci puts her all into playing Lizzie, a self-absorbed Ivy League writer wannabe who alienates friends and family with her out-of-control mood swings and other chemical imbalances. Ricci is committed and convincing, but nothing she does ameliorates Lizzie's exasperating personality; spending 90 minutes around this person is an eternity of tantrums. Around to provide audience stand-ins are Jason Biggs, Michelle Williams, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, all of whom disapprove of Lizzie's self-destructive behavior. Jessica Lange, professional as always, is Lizzie's brittle mother. If the movie really did capture the sense of the zeitgeist suggested by its grandiose title, or if it carried some intriguing stylistic urgency that carried us into its depressive labyrinth, perhaps Lizzie's journey would be palatable. But the long delay betweenProzac Nation's shooting (in 2001) and its emergence on cable-TV and DVD is all too easy to understand.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003IY498Y", "B00AEFXJ86", "B000HC2M0C", "0767821009", "B00003CWQR", "B004P7CN3G", "B00008Z463", "B0004Z3242", "B00AEFXJ1I", "B00005JLD1", "1573229628", "B003IY49K2", "B00005JMON", "B000092T3X", "076782153X", "B00ET2ODTE", "B00DW5IKYS", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B00EMAGKNU", "B00013RC2K", "B000FO0AD8", "B000021Y7L", "B00005UW73", "B004U7MR4G", "B001KEHAEE", "B005TTEFZ8", "B004OUZLGK", "B000GIXLXE", "B006Z7Z3VS", "B0037QGS0A", "B001URA5Y8", "B00020VZTS", "B00080ZHD2", "B00005QJIG", "B0083QN87K", "B000JBXXYK", "B00C7T0EPS", "0780625528", "B000TLTCQI", "B001CRC4DG", "B00005R87R", "B000255LIY", "B000BBOUUE", "B000DZ8540", "B000BX8R10", "B009M4KTUG", "B001URA5XY", "B000FIHN5M", "B00005JKJG", "B005Z9MGRG", "B006M3M5FM", "B00005Q4CS", "B00023P4I8", "076782170X", "B0030BOCMS", "B000F7CEC0", "B004SUDQDQ", "B007CEFTSA", "B00G5GNZ78", "B00EVU3T26", "B000F0UUD2", "0743223314", "B006ZGROB6", "B000089798", "B008NA3I30", "B005M2AKJW", "B009L79YRI", "B002ZG97O2", "B0029Z8K74", "B001C5LLVE", "B00BTYXNPK", "B00CPTUO1Y", "B000PKG8TM", "B0040J1RX6", "B00GPPXNIK", "B0006FO8E8", "B005M2AKLK", "B00375LBKI", "B0045HCIYA", "B00DVD5SBE", "B006GL8NQ0", "B00E8G5HXM", "B004XNNUZ2", "B002Q3MZXE", "B00I208ZHA", "B00005JMIJ", "B00005T30L", "B00003CXK7", "B00HW3EJ6Y", "0783241909", "B00AY6PK5A", "B0020LH8WU", "B00ET2ODU8", "B00C68SIUS", "B00068S3WS", "B00817TUVO", "B000LAZDPG", "B009OCR2U6", "B000022TSK", "B000PHX5MS"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFXJ86", "B003IY498Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFXJ86", "B003IY498Y", "B00003CWQR", "B000HC2M0C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 118534}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 20.15, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00094ASC2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51M300CS04L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Prozac Nation"}

{"description": "The classic to clunker ratio is still extraordinarily high, thoughThe Simpsons' sixth season could give some devoted viewers pause. The show that takes cheeky delight in mooning television convention gives us \"Another Simpsons Clip Show\" and its first season-ending cliffhanger, \"Who Shot Mr. Burns?\" And, as does Bart in \"A Star Is Burns,\" we should all feel a little dirty at the \"cheap cartoon crossover\" appearance of Jay Sherman (Jon Lovitz), designed to give a boost to the ill-fated animated seriesThe Critic. But this is just beard-stroking tongue-clucking regarding a season that delivered episodes that rank in the hallowedThe Simpsonspantheon, among them, \"Homer Badman,\" in which lust for a gummy Venus de Milo, peeled from the behind of an unwitting babysitter, makes Homer the object of feminist protest and tabloid TV fodder, and \"Homer the Great,\" in which Homer is discovered to be the Chosen One to lead the secret society, \"The Stonecutters\" (\"Who holds back the electric car/Who made Steve Guttenberg a star?/We do!\").  Several episodes take their inspiration from classic films and books: Hitchcock'sRear Window(\"Bart of Darkness\"); Michael Crichton'sWestworldandJurassic Park(\"Itchy and Scratchy Land\"); and Stephen King and Ray Bradbury (\"Treehouse of Horror V\").This season's roster of guest voices is also especially impressive, including Winona Ryder as \"Lisa's Rival,\" Meryl Streep as Rev. Lovejoy's bad-seed daughter (\"She's like a Milk Dud,\" a smitten Bart laments. \"Sweet on the outside, poison on the inside\"), the late Anne Bancroft in \"Fear of Flying\"; Patrick Stewart in \"Homer the Great\"; Mel Brooks and Susan Sarandon in \"Homer vs. Patty and Selma,\" and Mandy Patinkin as Lisa's future fianc&#xE9;e in the surprisingly moving \"Lisa's Wedding.\" There has, of late, been a feud a-brewin' between fans ofThe SimpsonsandFamily Guy. Which show is funnier? HasThe Simpsonslost it? IsFamily GuyaSimpsons-wannabe? Hey; Can't we all just laugh along?

{"description": "He never learns. In the fourth season of his award-winning HBO comedy series, the quasi-fictional character of Larry David continues to say--and do--whatever he wants whenever he wants. In the first episode alone (\"Mel's Offer\"), in which Mel Brooks offers him the role of Max Bialystock inThe Producers, David offends a doctor, a lesbian couple, a wheelchair user, and Ben Stiller (by not shaking his hand after he sneezes). Then, in the second (\"Ben's Birthday Party\"), he offends a blind man--by telling him his girlfriend's not as hot as she claims--and pokes Stiller in the eye with a skewer while attempting to show agent Jeff Greene (Jeff Garlin) his new golf move.Larry continues to offend Stiller until he drops out ofThe Producersand, in the fifth episode (\"The 5 Wood\"), David Schwimmer (Friends) steps in. The following episode (\"The Car Pool Lane\"), in which David attends a Dodgers game--with a prostitute, so he can use the carpool lane--made history when it set an innocent man free. Unused footage from the show, entered into evidence by the defense attorney, confirmed his client's alibi that he couldn't have committed a murder because he was at the game (alas, the Braves still trounced the Dodgers). Other guests include Ted Danson (\"The Weatherman\"), Russell Means (\"Wandering Bear\"), and Gina Gershon (\"The Survivor\") as a Hasidic hottie. In addition, the hour-long season finale (\"Opening Night\") boasts a bevy of stars, including David&#x92;s old colleague Jerry Seinfeld, Nathan Lane (Broadway's original Bialystock), and fellow Tony Award winner Anne Bancroft (The Miracle Worker).

{"description": "Movie studios, by and large, avoid controversial subjects like race the way you might avoid a hive of angry bees. So it's remarkable thatCrasheven got made; that it's a rich, intelligent, and moving exploration of the interlocking lives of a dozen Los Angeles residents--black, white, latino, Asian, and Persian--is downright amazing. A politically nervous district attorney (Brendan Fraser) and his high-strung wife (Sandra Bullock, biting into a welcome change of pace fromMiss Congeniality) get car-jacked by an oddly sociological pair of young black men (Larenz Tate and Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges); a rich black T.V. director (Terrence Howard) and his wife (Thandie Newton) get pulled over by a white racist cop (Matt Dillon) and his reluctant partner (Ryan Phillipe); a detective (Don Cheadle) and his Latina partner and lover (Jennifer Esposito) investigate a white cop who shot a black cop--these are only three of the interlocking stories that reach up and down class lines. Writer/director Paul Haggis (who wrote the screenplay forMillion Dollar Baby) spins every character in unpredictable directions, refusing to let anyone sink into a stereotype. The cast--ranging from the famous names above to lesser-known but just as capable actors like Michael Pena (Buffalo Soldiers) and Loretta Devine (Woman Thou Art Loosed)--meets the strong script head-on, delivering galvanizing performances in short vignettes, brief glimpses that build with gut-wrenching force.

{"description": "Herculesis the enjoyable, full-length version of a truncated television miniseries starring Scots actor Paul Telfer in a revisionist telling of the mythical Greek hero's life. Reputed to be the son of Zeus and Hera-worshipping priestess Alcmene (Elizabeth Perkins), Hercules is born a fraternal twin but half-brother to Iphicles (Luke Ford), son of Amphitryon (Timothy Dalton). Though he is raised under the latter's protection and counsel, Hercules has an unrelenting streak of bad luck that finds him accused of murder, rape, and the killing of his own children. With such a black cloud hanging over him, Hercules seeks redemption through his famous Labors. Sean Astin, Leelee Sobieski, and Leeanna Walsman co-star in a complex story of intrigue, revenge, and hope, full of gleaming swords and fairly good special effects, including a passable centaur and multi-headed hydra.

{"description": "A sitcom behemoth of the last 10 years,Friendsshot out of the gate in 1994 with snappy writing and an attractive cast. The exploits of sensitive paleontologist Ross Geller (David Schwimmer), his obsessive-compulsive sister Monica Geller (Courteney Cox); Monica's roommate Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston), a spoiled rich girl trying to live on her own; earthy aromatherapist/masseuse Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow); and Monica's neighbors across the hall-- sarcastic Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry) and his dim-bulb roommate Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc) became a nationwide obsession, a pop-culture icon (remember \"The Rachel\" haircut?)  and a top Nielsen hit for its entire run.See the10 or more seasons club.The first two seasons were mostly centered on the on-off saga of Ross and Rachel, and while their relationship remained a strong presence through romantic rivals and even a baby,View clips andvote for your favoriteFriendsmoment.the other characters eventually moved from sideshow players into a shared comedic lead. ButFriendswas not without its heart. Most of the cast had dysfunctional relationships with their parents and went through loss, divorce, marriage, parenthood, and love triangles. The emotional pregnancies of Rachel (by Ross) and Phoebe (surrogate to her half-brother's triplets) won the actresses Emmy Awards, and Joey's tender feelings for Rachel in Season 8 won LeBlanc, the most improved actor in the series, a nomination.Most sitcoms run out of ideas by the fifth season, butFriendsgave itself a refreshing jolt the minute Monica and Chandler wound up in bed together. Their budding romance was not only the one of the funniest arcs of the series, but one of the most sentimental, as they planned a wedding, struggled to have a child and eventually turned to adoption. By seasons seven and on, the characters had each \"grown up\" from young singletons to thirtysomethings finding permanence in their careers and love lives but never losing the laughs.Just friends? See our guide towho kissed whomonFriends.Friendsfeatured a parade of celebrity guests, but unlikeWill & Grace, it actually utilized most of the stars as more than cameos: The sextet's parents were all brilliantly cast, particularly Kathleen Turner as Chandler's drag-queen father and Teri Garr as Phoebe's dizzy mom. Everyone from George Clooney to Sean Penn to Julia Roberts to Bruce Willis has appeared on the sitcom, and Tom Selleck certainly enjoyed a career resuscitation after his recurring role as Monica's older man.But no star power ever penetrated the bond between the six stars, and their unmatchable chemistry worked for 10 seasons. Even if the show is on reruns daily, this boxed set ofFriendsremains watchable over and over again--even if that theme song grates on your nerves.Standout episodes include The One With All The Poker (Season 1), The One With The Birth (1), The One With the Prom Video (2), The One With the Flashback (3), The One Where Monica and Richard are Just Friends (3), The One Where Ross and Rachel Take a Break (3), The One With the Embryos (4), The One With All the Wedding Dresses (4), The One With the Thanksgiving Flashbacks (5), The One Where Everybody Finds Out (5), The One Where Ross Got High (6), The One With the Videotape (8), The One With the Rumor (8), The One With the Male Nanny (9), The One With Rachel's Other Sister (9), The One With Ross' Tan (10), and The One Where the Stripper Cries (10).--Ellen A.

{"description": "Asylumstars Natasha Richardson in an unsettling psychological thriller about the repressed, 1950s wife of a psychiatrist (Hugh Bonneville) and her affair with a convicted killer (Marton Csokas). Stella (Richardson), Max (Bonneville), and their son Charlie (Gus Lewis, who played the young Bruce Wayne inBatman Beyond) move to a high-security psychiatric hospital, where the priggish Max joins the staff and hopes to ascend, in time, to the top spot, replacing the soon-to-retire hospital director (Joss Ackland). Standing in Max's way is another doctor, Cleave (Ian McKellen), who takes a quiet yet somehow sinister interest in unhappy Stella's apparent attraction to Edgar (Csokas), a connection that will lead to more than one sorrowful end. Based on a novel by Patrick McGrath (who adapted his ownSpiderinto the screenplay for David Cronenberg's 2002 film),Asylumis directed by David Mackenzie (Young Adam) with a subtle but growing apprehension of manipulated destiny in Cleave's hands.

{"description": "Blockbuster action director Michael Bay delivers a striking look at a strange world of the future in this sci-fi action drama. Midway through the 21st century, Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) lives in a confined indoor community after ongoing abuse of the Earth has rendered most of the planet uninhabitable. One of the only places in the outside world still capable of sustaining life is an idyllic island where citizens are chosen to live through a lottery. Or at least that's what Lincoln and his fellow citizens are taught to believe; the truth is that Lincoln, like everyone he knows, is actually a clone who is kept under wraps to provide needed organs when the person who supplied his or her DNA falls ill. When he becomes aware that his existence is a fraud, Lincoln escapes to the outside world with a fellow clone, Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson), though the powers that be are determined to see that no one gets away alive.The Islandalso stars Steve Buscemi, Djimon Hounsou, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Sean Bean.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767805712", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B0069UP2PI", "B00005JL78", "B0013PSTMC", "B004LWZW7E", "B004XQO90O", "B008JFUO36", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B00AEFXCLU", "B001GCUO02", "B0001NBNDY", "B002GIBVVG", "B00KHWSB5M", "B0018O4YT0", "B00005JLWN", "B0001CNRAM", "B002ZG98SW", "B00005JN0T", "B00K7IPFSM", "B00JPFTX5O", "B0009YA3OA", "B001CC7PLM", "B000AP04FG", "B005LAIIMG", "B005LAII8A", "B0013LL2Z2", "B002ZG980U", "B008JFUN50", "B00005JMWP", "B000EQHXNW", "B004WCTLNY", "B004EPYZOO", "B001GKJ2E8", "B007R6DJP8", "B00AEFXSLE", "B00AKGG8I2", "B000EZ908Y", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00BEIYIF0", "B0045HCJ8A", "B004LWZW4M", "B000BVM1S2", "B0067EKYAY", "B00AEBB8NI", "B001FB55HQ", "B00005JPAR", "B004LWZW42", "B001VLBDD0", "B0062P3392", "B000FS9FCG", "B008JFUPFI", "B00IKM5MIA", "B004A8ZX28", "B000056PMU", "B00005JPD0", "B005COLETU", "B003Q6D2B4", "B004EPYZSK", "B000P0J0EW", "B009AMAJPA", "B002SG7Z7A", "B00H83EUQW", "B000LC55F2", "B00DWZHTOU", "B005NKIPUY", "B005LAIHPE", "B000A2IPQY", "B00AEBB89W", "B0051MKNV8", "B005LAIIPS", "B001EAWMGA", "B00A7MSQRK", "6304711891", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B002GHHHOC", "B0021L8V0M", "B000P0I4O4", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AS1Q93S", "B00004XPPG", "B0045HCJFS", "B003UYUQZW", "B001OQCVI8", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00096S49Y", "B005LAIGRS", "B000EGDB10", "B002ZG984Q", "B000FGGE68", "B003L20IG0", "B0036TGSR6", "B0045HCJGC", "B002DU39GW", "B0002KVUKM", "B008JFUQZ2", "B000H30B2C", "0767803434", "B00AEBB8QK"], "bought_together": ["0767805712", "B0069UP2PI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004WCTLNY", "B004XQO90O", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B004SBQAN8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 95555}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.44, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B000BO0LH2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5133H8SZ04L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Island"}

{"description": "Here's what you'll find in the seventh season ofRed Dwarf: the truth behind the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the return of Ace Rimmer (or a reasonable facsimile), an emotional rollercoaster created  from real emotions, a very seductive virus, and numerous mishaps involving dimensional accidents, wormholes, nanobots, and male-female relationships. If that makes perfect sense to you, you're undoubtedly a fan of the cult comedy/science fiction series, but even if you're not, there are plenty of laughs to be had. Of course, not everyRed Dwarffan will be in accordance--Series 7 has been the subject of much controversy since its original airing in 1997-98, due mostly to the departure of co-creator Rob Grant, the departure of Chris Barrie's Arnold Rimmer, and the arrival of new castmate Chloe Annett as Dave Lister's ex-girlfriend, Christine Kochanski (who had been played by another actress, Clare Grogan, in earlier episodes). But no matter which side you happen to pick for this debate, there are still enough amusing and thought-provoking moments in each episode to please even the most demanding fan.Highlights for the season include the opener, \"Tikka to Ride,\" which turns a trip for curry into a visit to Dallas circa '63; \"Blue,\" which addresses the departure of Rimmer and the uncomfortable relationship between Kochanski, Lister (Craig Charles), and Kryten (Robert Llewellyn), and \"Nanarchy,\" in which the aforementioned microscopic robots create more havoc than actual repair. Supplemental features have always been one of the main attractions to the Red Dwarf DVD sets, and Series 7 doesn't disappoint: included are commentary by the cast (including Norman Lovett, the original Holly) on \"Nanarchy\"; \"Back from the Dead,\" a 90-minute featurette with new interviews and previously unseen footage; a pair of short films made by fans for a competition; extended editions of three episodes (with no laugh track); 40 minutes of deleted scenes; early effects footage; and lots more.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EU1Q4U", "B0006Z2L0Q", "B0006Z2L0G", "B0026P3HPW", "B0000WN0ZU", "B009Z59778", "B0000WN0ZA", "B00007AP32", "B00007AP31", "B002FQJT0Y", "B009Z5BPYG", "B00L326LTI", "B00E688U9K", "B006LPHY6G", "B000BHHVNQ", "B00CDEJRDC", "B001NOMOS8", "B00C6ACVWM", "B00GRZPRQO", "B00C6ACWLC", "B00IO998U2", "B001B23ED6", "B008R52LA2", "B00443FN1A", "B00C6ACUF0", "B000HEWEJ4", "B0002F6BSS", "B000067FPC", "B0035JHYMA", "B000B7QCJ0", "B001C71IGA", "B00004WG2D", "B00C6ACT3I", "B004SGWYW4", "B004GJYRGO", "B0002848WQ", "B00I462Y60", "B001Q9ECNA", "B000Z7G87W", "B000BNI90Y", "B00129W6LE", "B002E58FU6", "B00F3L8P26", "B00AATGDXO", "B00A2XQTVY", "B00A2XQU7M", "B0013LL2Z2"], "bought_together": ["B000EU1Q4U", "B0006Z2L0Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0006Z2L0Q", "B009Z59778", "B0000WN0ZU", "B0006Z2L0G"]}, "price": 16.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 151163}, "asin": "B000BVM1TQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P-32nPQkL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Red Dwarf: Series VII"}

{"description": "Based on Anthony Swofford&#x92;s excellentmemoirabout his experiences as a Marine Sniper in Gulf War I,Jarheadis a war movie in which the waiting is a far greater factor upon the characters than the war itself, and the build up to combat is more drama than what combat is depicted. To some viewers hoping for typical movie action, this will seem like a cruel joke. But it&#x92;s not. It&#x92;s just the story as it was written, and if you liked the book, you will probably like the movie. If you didn&#x92;t, then the movie won&#x92;t change your mind.The movie follows the trajectory of Swofford (played with thoughtful intensity by Jake Gyllenhaal) from wayward Marine recruit (he joined because he \"got lost on the way to college\") to skilled Marine sniper, and on into the desert in preparation for the attack on Iraq. No-nonsense, Marine-for-life Staff Sgt. Sykes (Jamie Foxx), the man who recruited Swofford and his spotter Troy (Peter Sarsgaard) into the sniper team, leads them in training, and in waiting where their lives are dominated by endless tension, pointless exercises in absurdity (like playing football in the scorching heat of the desert in their gas masks so it will look better for the media&#x92;s TV cameras), more training, and constant anticipation of the moment to come when they&#x92;ll finally get to kill. When the war does come, it moves too fast for Swofford&#x92;s sniper team, and the one chance they get at a kill--to do the one thing they&#x92;ve trained so hard and waited so long for--eludes them, leaving them to wonder what was the point of all they had endured.As directed by Sam Mendes (American Beauty), the movie remains very loyal to the language and vision of the book, but it doesn&#x92;t entirely work as the film needs something more than a literal translation to bring out its full potential. Mendes&#x92;s stark and, at times, apocalyptic visuals add a lot and strike the right tone: wide shots of inky-black oil raining down on the vast, empty desert from flaming oil wells contrasted with close-ups of crude-soaked faces struggling through the mire vividly bring to life the meaning of the tagline \"welcome to the suck.\" But much of the second half of the movie will probably leave some viewers feeling disappointed in the cinematic experience, while others might appreciate its microcosmic depiction of modern chaos and aimlessness.Jarheadis one of those examples where the book is better than the movie, but not for lack of trying.--Dan Vancini", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00JRB01RK", "B00275EGWY", "B001FB55L2", "B000065U1N", "B00JRB00RG", "B000P0J09C", "B00JU949TK", "079284646X", "B002ZG97RE", "B0015D20FE", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B00001ZWUS", "B005LAIGYQ", "B00AEBBA36", "B00JA3RVG4", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B008220CQU", "B00HEPE6MM", "B00102F5WK", "B003ASLJOU", "B000095WW8", "B00AZNEW5G", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00005YUPD", "B004XQO90O", "B000Y7WGOW", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00IKM5OCO", "B00JBGSHSQ", "B00005JOFQ", "B0036RPM8Y", "B00AEBB89W", "0743244915", "B003ELKNH2", "B00JL6L4UY", "B004L3AR0K", "B00A34LX2M", "B00005PJ8T", "B004SUDQ22", "B00I4X8KXY", "B00J11U54K", "B00005JK8K", "B00J0IN6Z4", "B0034G4P30", "B00IARA8KM", "B0000AC8LR", "B000M4RG42", "B00HW3LAF2", "B00DL48BM6", "B004LGGXG4", "B0000ACOXL", "B00AEFXVCU", "B0000542CK", "B00005JLOB", "B00006JU8B", "B0000797IO", "B00JPFTS2M", "B00005U8QN", "B005LAIGRS", "B00AEBB86U", "B00HEPC0TS", "B00KDK64DY", "B00JH4SZWK", "B00IO03I6Q", "B00HWWUR02", "B001MZ5W3M", "B000KGGIZK", "B000DZ7YN8", "B00005JMXX", "B00AEBB86A", "B0007KIFGE", "B00IKM5MIA", "1558908315", "B005LAIGLE", "B001N44BVQ", "B00IJS2OHM", "B00005R87B", "B00J5JSV3A", "B00HX0KIAM", "B00ICWO144", "B00GV8B17Q", "B00JQF7ZR6", "B003UESJHO", "B00005JL5F", "B00GMV8JVI", "B00IKM5NJS", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00KNALRZ4", "B00JU94ZPS", "B00E8AVNAE", "B00HVXK15S", "B00004XPPG", "B0034G4P94", "B009POCG0Y", "B008MIL46Q", "B009AMAJPA", "B001AQO3WY", "B00HGJAPYO", "B00ALCBTWU", "B008JFUNKU"], "bought_together": ["B00275EGWY", "B000065U1N"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00275EGWY", "B00JU949TK", "B000065U1N", "B000P0J09C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15490}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.75, "brand": "VISIT MORE @ HIBISCUS EXPRESS, http://www.amazon.com/shops/AXD9LOVGJXES3", "asin": "B000DZIGDU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P2RVVCH9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jarhead (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "CBS had an instant hit on their hands whenThe Wild Wild Westmade its network debut on September 17, 1965. While many of the popularTV Westernswere running out of steam, series creator Michael Garrison ripped a page from the Ian Fleming/Sean Connery playbook and conceivedThe Wild Wild Westas a \"James Bond Western,\" energizing the genre by combining a traditional Western setting (primarily the San Francisco region in the 1870s) with the accoutrements of the spy genre. It was a foolproof formula, further refined by producer Fred Frieberger (who later produced the third and final season ofStar Trek), andTWWWheld its popular time-slot (7:30-8:30 on Friday nights) for its entire four-season run. Smart casting proved to be another source of audience appeal: While Robert Conrad fit nicely into his role (and tight-fitting costume) as macho Secret Service agent James West, doing his own challenging stunts and charming each episode's obligatory beautiful female guest star, Ross Martin proved an equally excellent choice to play West's skillful sidekick Artemus Gordon, a debonair dandy whose mastery of disguises and dialects would prove essential as they tackled dangerous crime-fighting assignments from President Ulysses S. Grant.The series' unique appeal arose from its clever and frequently bizarre plots. Every episode title began with a variation of \"The Night of...\" (including the pilot, \"The Night of the Inferno,\" with more unusual titles thereafter), and as Jim and Arte plotted strategies from the comfort of their tricked-out custom railroad car, their exploits frequently led them into realms of the occult, mad science, bizarre inventions, and villains so eccentrically twisted that they became instant favorites among the show's growing legion of fans. Best of them all was the nefarious Miguelito Loveless, first appearing in \"The Night the Wizard Shook the Earth\" (original airdate 10/01/65) and played to perfection by dwarf actor Michael Dunn, a '60s TV regular familiar toStar Trekfans from his memorable role in the original series episode \"Plato's Stepchildren.\" A gifted, intellectual renaissance man (like Ross Martin) with an angelic singing voice, Dunn was an overnight sensation, guest-starring in four of the first season's 28 episodes, with six more appearances in subsequent seasons. Dunn's gleeful malevolence (accompanied by his mute henchman Voltaire, played by giant actor Richard Kiel) was an essential addition to the series' sideshow esthetic; weirdness, humor, gorgeous women, and devious ingenuity (in plotting, action and gadgetry), became the trademarks that setTWWWapart from its more conventional TV Western competition.--Jeff ShannonOn the DVDFor this much-anticipated DVD release, Paramount has made above-average efforts to satisfy fans. Virtually every episode looks and sounds practically brand-new, and withTWWWexpert Sue Kesler serving as DVD co-producer, this seven-disc set features a wealth of archival extras, many culled from Kesler's own research as author of the out-of-print guidebookThe Wild Wild West: The Series. In addition to excerpts from audio-taped interviews with Frieberger, writer (and \"Dr. Loveless\" creator) John Kneubuhl (who tells a fascinating story of how Liberace almost guest-starred on the show), music composer Richard Markowitz, and special-effects technician Tim Smyth, each episode includes brief but informative audio introductions by Robert Conrad, who also appears (with Martin) discussing the show (and their subsequent TV-movie revival ofTWWW) in a 1978 talk-show appearance. Excerpts from the original music-theme scoring sessions were found in UCLA's Film and Television archive, and other extras include a network series promo clip (from a later season, afterTWWWswitched to color), a sketch by Ross Martin, a photo gallery, and even one of Conrad's notorious Eveready Battery commercials from the late '70s. All in all, this 40th Anniversary package should giveTWWWfans ample reason to celebrate, boding well for the other season-sets to follow.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000LE16Y4", "B000UX6TKC", "B00105307O", "B000HWZ4HU", "B0012EBV88", "B000BOH8Z0", "B000NOIX66", "B000BZISS0", "B0007KIFK0", "B00E5G03I4", "B0012EBV8I", "B000UX6TJI", "B007AAF3FK", "B000BGR1B4", "B000LE16VC", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B000CCBCK8", "B00J9BZ4KC", "B0000DC3VM", "B00KTZALDC", "B000EQ46HI", "B000EQ46H8", "B000FFJ87Q", "B000EHSVB4", "B000EXDS2A", "B00IXPWGIS", "B0012Z36FI", "B000A6T1J0", "B000K7VHYG", "B00B00HUC0", "B001BN4WI6", "B00005JNS8", "B000GUJZ0U", "B0002COTDA", "B008I34Y3K", "B000FSME1K", "B000PHX5KU", "B0007YMWGY", "B000IHYXIK", "B000M8N412", "B002DPH91I", "B000NOIX7K", "B00E96AY20", "B00FNRA0KA", "B00JEZWRE4", "B0002CX1M0", "B000XJD3K2", "B00005JNHU", "B000PGTPC8", "B000E33VZ4", "B000W8OM68", "B00JDCP0QA", "B0044XV7AQ", "B00K6J7FGC", "B000N6UF10", "B001E6JC30", "B0014FAIVG", "B00BXTDVEO", "B00013F38K", "B009V2KO9K", "B000N2HD6O", "B001S86IZE", "B005TZFYWA", "B000LV6W00", "B002L9N4E2", "B0046S8MRU", "B002GOAH1A", "B0002W4TVM", "B000LPS2VS", "B00BUDDMGU", "B00A2L1CKO", "B001FT4PEW", "B0014BQR3I", "B000LXGXY8", "B0006UEVTA", "B000BF0C8E", "B00132D7VI", "B001E6JC1W", "B001CQONOA", "B0009B16TO", "B00005JLEY", "B000ASDFIG", "B000FOQ03C", "B001TWT0CW", "B000F9T70K", "B000ARLYDK", "B0013PVGGI", "B0001JXQ2Y", "B00GWJIDB6", "B0000V4906", "B000TQZBNQ", "B000FSMEB0", "B004X1M3IO", "B007V4ETS2", "B00CMQIDVI", "B000RZIGTA", "B00BUWD7NE", "B001J0FVYK", "B00IS6WQ2S", "B00CCYNYBO"], "bought_together": ["B000LE16Y4", "B000UX6TKC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001CQONOA", "B000LE16Y4", "B000UX6TKC", "B00105307O"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 46749}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 29.08, "brand": "Wild West", "asin": "B000ERVJKO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AS4MSEK2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Wild Wild West - The Complete First Season"}
{"description": "Asia Argento's adaptation of JT Leroy's short story collection,The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things, still has the heartbreaking urgency of a tale about child abuse, regardless of Leroy's proven fraudulent identity. Weaving plots together from Leroy's two books,Sarah, andThe Heart Is Deceitful, Argento relays the history of orphaned Jeremiah (Jimmy Bennett/Cole Sprouse), whose mother Sarah (Asia Argento) abandons him as a baby to work as a truck-stop lot lizard for her methamphetamine habit. Sarah tears Jeremiah away from a stable foster home to pathetically attempt mothering her seven-year old son. Jeremiah instantly grows up in strip clubs, drug dealers' homes, big rigs, and in the hot rod that he and his mother call home. His sadomasochistic sexual psychology also develops prematurely, informed by men who rape and beat him, and a mother whose work as a hooker requires Jeremiah's dressing up as a girl to pass as her younger sister. Enter a born again, psychotically zealous Grandfather (Peter Fonda) who takes temporary custody of Jeremiah, and the viewer begins to understand Sarah's severe rebelliousness, sensing that the punk, 23-year old prostitute may be a better parent for Jeremiah, simply because she loves him. Shot by Eric Alan Edwards(Kids, My Own Private Idaho), and with a soundtrack including Sonic Youth, Subhumans, Billy Corgan, and Hasil Adkins, the film has a raunchy, Southern appeal similar to that of Leroy's books. Cameos appearances by Winona Ryder and Marilyn Manson add rock star power. Argento keeps it sexy, as this is as much a story of the mother-child bond as it is about the malformation of a boy's sexual identity. True or not,The Heart is Deceitful Above All Thingsis a sincere yet stylized rendition of a terribly sad story.--Trinie Dalton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000HC2M2K", "B0025KVKDO", "B000FJGR76", "B0015LPRZQ", "B000KX0HFK", "B0001XAQ9Q", "B000A2X3MU", "B0006ZXJMK", "B000CQLZ8S", "B004V8W52S", "B001G5RSRG", "1582342113", "B00ECXJBN8", "B0010DR4BO", "158234146X", "B00008EYA5", "B000ROAME8", "B000ALM4AS", "B00006G8JQ", "0060987464", "B001AZKB8K", "B000TJBN80", "B0016MJ6T2", "B0009KA7XG", "B001662FK0", "B00DPUB56U", "B009SFR2QI", "B00023P4I8", "B0001ZMXKE", "B000059HA5", "B0083TUE7E", "6305777837", "B00366BJAK", "B000AYEL10", "B0046WCM7M", "B001152TL6", "B000FDE5CQ", "B005M2AKJW", "B0013D8L7W", "B00028G6Y4", "B00HOGBXS6", "B000063K0V", "B000F6II1M", "B000WWQI0W", "B00AO7HPSY", "1583228519", "B007OXB1H2", "B000BR6QIW", "B00275EGX8", "B001AR0D6I", "B003VL3UR0", "B00005N6QY", "B000E3LD54", "B000A2UBN4", "B001EHDMW6", "B000I0QLQY", "B00EOBB7LC", "B00004ZBVO", "B000P7V5MA", "B008220DGE", "B000HT38EO", "B00000IC7G", "B0000A2ZNK", "B00007G1Z6", "B000PITXT6", "B0009RQRT2", "B0002Y4TE2", "B001GKJ2E8", "B002X9S6RK", "B003B2UK1S", "B003TRMLQM", "B000FFJYDY", "B0020LH8WU", "B00275EGWY", "B00CVHRCTM", "B00000K3UU", "B00187FPC2", "B00004YA67", "B001A4VH2U", "B005D0RDKM", "B00H91LWDM", "B000087F7E", "B004P2VQZ2", "B00BEIYG98", "B000ZLFAM2", "B0000A9GHF", "B00A0P17L6", "B001J710Y8", "0783230427", "B00009W0U4", "B0009S2KJM", "B0085A9HU6", "B00013RC2K", "B007XF0W3K", "B000A7Q2I2", "1582341427", "B000EGDMOG", "B000MM1FC8"], "bought_together": ["B000HC2M2K", "B000FJGR76"], "buy_after_viewing": ["1582342113", "B0015LPRZQ", "B000FJGR76", "B000HC2M2K"]}, "price": 15.63, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 153304}, "asin": "B000F1IO3E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GGT9RW1WL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things"}

{"description": "A science fiction-Western and comedy-drama with echoes ofThe Wild Wild WestandRaiders of the Lost Ark,The Adventures of Brisco County Jr.: The Complete Seriesis uniquely entertaining. Anchored by the comically heroic style of likable B-movie actor Bruce Campbell,Adventureslasted one television season in 1993-94. But it left behind a full 27 episodes (including two two-part stories) full of classic TV Western production values and a running storyline that resemblesThe X-Filesafter awhile.Campbell plays Brisco County Jr., a bounty hunter and son of a legendary U.S. marshal (R. Lee Ermey) gunned down by the villainous John Bly (Billy Drago) and his band of misfits. The younger Brisco is hired by a consortium of businessmen to protect their interests from the likes of Bly, and while he's dedicated to that cause, Brisco is also determined to avenge his father's murder. Helping him do a little of both is a fussy attorney, Socrates Poole (Christian Clemenson); a rival bounty hunter, Lord Bowler (Julius Carry); a wacky inventor, Professor Wickwire (John Astin); and a sultry saloon singer, Dixie (Kelly Rutherford). Rockets, mysterious orbs, and superhuman strength are some of the delightfully out-of-their-element phenomena that find themselves alongside more conventional cowpoke ingredients, including a horse so smart he can chew the ropes binding Brisco's hands. For the most part, the stories stand alone. But as the season progresses, a lot of things get weirder, albeit in a good way: the truth about Bly and his connection to a golden orb everyone wants, for example, are certainly unexpected. But the show is always dazzling, often satiric (\"Oy!\" Dixie exclaims when Brisco outlines the steps involved in stopping a runaway wagon they're trapped within), yet heartening in an old-fashioned way. Special features include Campbell's reading of a chapter about the series in his autobiography.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FJH5MC", "B001KEGR5M", "B0009JE6FM", "B001KEGR5W", "B00005JOJP", "B000WC38FA", "B000AQ69QS", "B00F3L8P26", "B00LT1JHLW", "B00KTZALDC", "B0001LQJMQ", "0312291450", "B001CQONOA", "031231261X", "B009ERK2UI", "B005NKIPUO", "B004ZBFRG2", "B001KEGR7U", "B004EXWGJW", "B000PFUAN2", "B003BGZ61S", "B00IXPWGIS", "B00E96AY20", "B00LLV9XJQ", "B003XMKU3Y", "B001AQO3XS", "0312242646", "B00LMBUR6S", "B00IS6WQ2S", "B002PQ7JQK", "B004XM38CS", "B0006UEVUE", "0783227434", "B00404ME2E", "B0056GLNQI", "B004PQM81E", "B005UFUU6E", "B00LCAD24S", "B00L326LTI", "B00LNBQ8SI", "B00KUS5YGC", "B00HZMZ286", "B003XMKU0M", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B000H7JCFK", "B0063DOV2Q", "B000BF0C8E", "B000XJD3K2", "B000BGR1B4", "B00DYQ1GBE", "B003QS0E54", "B00B00HUC0", "B006LPHY6G", "B008R52LA2", "B002ZCY84U", "B00005JNIS", "B0081QF6Q8", "B00IGVJH0E", "B000HEVZ7G", "B00FQ1PSO6", "B000N2HD6O", "B003H9LIU2", "B000NOKFGW", "B00005JNU5", "B002GY9F9K", "B000IJ7A5Q", "B002QU1Z1K", "B00L9SXSCE", "B00C6F61IW", "B00J2T1856", "B0014BQR38", "B001C0PFG6", "B009OE2NZI", "B00LNBQ8UG", "B006P2TA44", "0783228457", "B004HHX9T6", "B001D2WUD4", "B000ELL1QC", "B000YENUOK", "B005GYXN2M", "B000RXVNCO", "B00LBHOCHS", "B00L9K2EGS", "B00JAD6BYW", "B00009WVTJ", "B00E5G03I4", "B0016MJ6P6", "B000HT38HQ", "B00402FGE4", "B00F77MAC2", "B000LXGXY8", "B003UD7J26", "B00IF0KAYS", "B004EXWGHY", "B00IMQZV3U", "B00JRENJTY", "B00IU6HPIQ", "B00005JN8Q", "B0009A407A"], "bought_together": ["B000FJH5MC", "B00005JOJP"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FJH5MC", "B00AQ6FFUI", "B00F3L8P26", "0312291450"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2338}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 18.8, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B000F7CMPE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61VP0BFB2GL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.: The Complete Series"}

{"description": "The charmed life of a successful young engineer is thrown into chaos following a decidedly uncomfortable dinner with his powerful boss and the man's socially scabrous wife in With a Friend Like Harry director Dominik Moll's twisted, semi-supernatural thriller. Upon relocating to an ultra-modern community in the south of France with the promise of a lucrative position at powerful Richard Pollock's (Andr  Dussollier) hi-tech firm, Alain Getty (Laurent Lucas) and his wife, Benedicte (Charlotte Gainsbourg), find their life together going better than they ever imagined. Happy in his work and deeply in love with his beautiful wife, Alain relishes his newfound success before a fateful dinner with Richard and his venomously eccentric wife, Alice (Charlotte Rampling), casts a dark thunderhead over Alain's azure skies. Unable to sleep after the troubling and abbreviated dinner and driven to repair the kitchen sink during a sleepless fit of late-night productivity, Alain is shocked to discover that a lemming has become lodged in the drainage pipes. As Alain attempts to discover just how a rodent native to Scandinavia found its way to a tiny drain pipe in France, a sudden revelation regarding the grim fate of Richard's troubled wife finds the once rational engineer struggling to maintain his sanity, and his marriage, against a malevolent and seemingly supernatural force. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006RZ2W", "B00005JMIJ", "B00004R611", "B00ARX2VZW", "B00007G1XQ", "B0009XRZKQ", "B00D3LA5WG", "B0030BOCFU", "B0074V619W", "B00005NTN4", "B008WAM2EM", "B000069HV1", "B0001EFV9A", "1572525983", "B003L20IJ2", "B0000DIJPW", "B00068S3QY", "B00006HAWU"], "bought_together": ["B00005JMIJ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004R611", "B001JV5BA8", "B00005JMIJ", "B000069HV1"]}, "price": 14.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 201094}, "asin": "B000FGGNA0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51f1FJd52ML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lemming (Original French Version - With English Subtitles)"}
{"description": "Just call him \"Jesse the Greek.\" In the fourth season premiere ofFull House, Katsopolis receives a visit from his European relatives, including Michelle's look-a-like cousin, marking one of the few times in the show&#x92;s eight-season history that the Olsen twins will share the screen. \"Greek Week\" ends with Jesse (John Stamos) and Becky (Lori Loughlin) getting engaged--a \"big fat wedding\" will transpire before the year is through. Interestingly, life will imitate art in 1998 when Stamos weds a real-life Rebecca (model/actress Rebecca Romijn). Other developments include a new production company, Double J Creative Services, for Joey (Dave Coulier) and Jesse (\"The I.Q. Man\")--with Danny as their silent partner--and Becky and Jesse finally tie the knot (\"The Wedding\" two-parter). Standout episodes include \"Secret Admirer,\" in which everyone (who is able to read) thinks a fake love letter is intended for them, and \"One Last Kiss,\" in which Jesse covers the Knack's \"My Sharona\" at his high school reunion. He may have abandoned the mullet to the 1980s, but the 1990s edition proves he can still get his rock on. (The same cannot be said about Danny's misguided attempts at coolness.)Fourth season guests include Wayne Newton (\"Viva Las Joey\"), Jaleel \"Urkel\" White (\"Stephanie Gets Framed\"), and those eternal beach bunnies, Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello (\"Joey Goes Hollywood\"). Also continuing to receive guest star billing is Andrea Barber (nosey neighbor Kimmy), even though she appears in most of the 25 episodes. The year ends with two graduations, D.J. (Candace Cameron) from junior high and Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen) from pre-school (\"The Graduates\"). Most importantly, there&#x92;s a Katsopolis birth announcement (\"Rock the Cradle\"). As Michelle would say, \"Whoah, baby!\"--Kathleen C.

{"description": "The innate connection between twins is a strange but very real phenomenon, so it's no surprise that when 21-year old twins Camryn (Tamera Mowry) and Alex (Tia Mowry) bump into one other in a clothing shop, they feel an instant connection with one another even though they were separated at birth.  What is a surprise is that the two girls are really powerful witches from another dimension who were spirited away to escape the destructive force known as the \"Darkness.\"  Kept safe for the last 21 years by two quirky protectors Karsh and Ileana, the girls are now destined to combine their respective gifts of sight and knowing with their newly discovered magical powers in order to save their own mother and her entire dimension from the invading Darkness.  The biggest difficulties for the girls prove to be learning to trust in themselves and their powers, agreeing upon their combined role in the fight, and focusing their powers against the Darkness.  Based on the bookThe Power of Two, this 86-minute Disney Channel Original Movie features a convincing and enthusiastic performance by Disney Channel'sSister, Sisterstars Tia and Tamara Mowry and some other-worldly special effects.  Bonus features include brief behind the scenes commentary by Tia and Tamara Mowry, a never-before-seen alternate ending, and an interactive fortune-telling game.

{"description": "This clever, funny big-screen adaptation of Lauren Weisberger's best-seller takes some of the snarky bite out of the chick lit book, but smoothes out the characters' boxy edges to make a more satisfying movie. There's no doubtThe Devil Wears Prada belongs to Meryl Streep, who turns in an Oscar&#65533;-worthy (seriously!) strut as the monster editor-in-chief ofRunway, an elite fashion magazine full of size-0, impossibly well-dressed plebes. This makes new second-assistant Andrea (Anne Hathaway), who's smart but an unacceptable size 6, stick out like a sore thumb. Streep has a ball sending her new slave on any whimsical errand, whether it's finding the seventh (unpublished) Harry Potter book or knowing what type she means when she wants \"skirts.\" Though Andrea thumbs her nose at the shallow world of fashion (she's only doing the job to open doors to a position atThe New Yorker someday), she finds herself dually disgusted yet seduced by the perks of the fast life. The film sends a basic message: Make work your priority, and you'll be rich and powerful... and lonely. Any other actress would have turned Miranda into a scenery-chewing Cruella, but Streep's underplayed, brilliant comic timing make her a fascinating, unapologetic character. Adding frills to the movie's fun are Stanley Tucci as Streep's second-in-command, Emily Blunt (My Summer of Love) as the overworked first assistant, Simon Baker as a sexy writer, and breathtaking couture designs any reader ofVogue would salivate over. --Ellen A.

{"description": "Growing up can be a confusing journey fraught with difficult choices.  Boog (Martin Lawrence) is a domesticated Grizzly Bear who leads a perfectly happy life inside of Park Ranger Beth's (Debra Messing) garage, but a chance meeting with an overly energetic mule deer named Elliot (Ashton Kutcher) quickly changes everything and lands Boog high in the forest a few days before the opening of hunting season.  Devoid of even the most basic survival skills, Boog and Elliot stumble through the woods and find themselves at the mercy of every forest animal from skunks to chipmunks as well as an evil hunter named Shaw (Gary Sinise).  After unintentionally inciting and endangering an entire forest full of clever animals, Boog and Elliot come to the realization that only by banding together do the forest animals stand a chance of outsmarting the hunters and ensuring their own survival.This first animated film from Sony Pictures Animation takes its inspiration from cartoonist Steve Moore(In the Bleachers)and features animals with human-like intelligence, a vibrant color palate, and skilled animation that makes everything from the wind blowing Boo's fur to the animals' wild trip down the falls simply breathtaking.  While it doesn't quite live up toOver the Hedge,Open Seasonis an entertaining production that explores the difficult process of maturation, the universal need for acceptance, and the true value of friendship.  Special features include a 15-minute featurette about the animation process at Sony Pictures Animation and Image Works, a 7-minute look at the recording sessions featuring the voices behind the characters, two deleted scenes, three short animated cartoon strips, a short \"Boog and Elliot's Midnight Bun Run\" that's an extension of the trailer scene in the movie, art gallery, beat boards, humorous commentary from the animals' point of views, and a full length commentary by Producer Michelle Murdocca, Directors Roger Allers and Jill Culton, and others.  Activities include a \"Voice-A-Rama\" where viewers can hear specific lines spoken by alternate voices and a trivia \"Wheel of Fortune--Forest Edition\" as well as a DVD-ROM link to more online fun.

{"description": "Anyone who seeks out a Steven Seagal movie has certain expectations:  Bone-crunchingly brutal martial arts action; spiritual or ecological wisdom uttered in Seagal's hoarse monotone; and one long relentless scowl.Flight of Furyfails to deliver on all counts. Seagal plays an ex-military guy who's the only man who can retrieve a stolen stealth fighter. So he goes to Afghanistan, where he teams up with a sexy agent of some kind (Ciera Payton, making her cinematic debut) to shoot a bunch of Afghan mercenaries and fly away. The only plausible explanation for this movie's existence is that Seagal and his producers bought some stock footage of jet fighters and decided to build a story around it. The action scenes are murky, brief, and edited to compensate for Seagal's increasing bulk. The rote dialogue--co-written by Seagal--is recycled from a dozen other action movies. And Seagal can't even muster the energy to frown, let alone scowl. This inert lump of a movie is the latest in a series of clumsy, incompetent, straight-to-video clunkers from Seagal, who is cynically squeezing every dollar he can out of his long-suffering fanbase.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000F6IOCA", "B0030E5PWQ", "B001AR010Q", "B000A5043S", "B000VECACQ", "B000255LCK", "B004MLEYUU", "B00083FZEU", "B002G1WPIG", "B00007JZUP", "B004V4RT8C", "B0090EDEM8", "B0011VIO4Q", "B001MLZNKS", "B000E6ESD0", "B001VFM0YC", "B00005QAP6", "B000BRBA92", "B0006VL1IS", "B000006PAB", "B000QXDCLU", "6305428158", "B00009ZPTZ", "B0000844MD", "B000U1ZV6C", "B008XAT0SW", "B0050MB5NO", "B00FEHCPZ2", "B002WSZSNM", "B0045HCIWW", "B004SEUJ1O", "B002ZG98C8", "0790740826", "0790729334", "B00003CXW4", "B0045HCJFS", "B003YXZHI0", "B001B3LIOC", "B00067BBRS", "B003Z94WBG", "B0090EDE1Y", "B0017XOF50", "B004USUP1C", "B0087OULG4", "B0045HCIWM", "B001VFM0YM", "6304712898", "B00A4TMLNG", "B00JU94ZPS", "B000E0WJLE", "B00BUAEYVK", "B0035G5IZI", "B00DSDUVFK", "B00E5SAJ5Y", "B0010YVCB6", "B008R52L3E", "B000ENUYH2", "B004MLEYU0", "B00596WEVI", "B00FEHCQNI", "B008NP4ZUU", "B00BUH1QHS", "B000HT38HQ", "B001B8T6C8", "B001M9ELQC", "B000N3T0E6", "B002GHHHME", "B0045O2PFU", "B00BLF9FOK", "B003G0E31I", "B00H1RMWYW", "B000ELL1Q2", "B006JN8798", "B0062P3392", "076780970X", "B000GW8U9U", "B00FRILRL6", "B000ENUYGS", "B003VQO4WU", "B007XTDXDW", "B00005N5QW", "B007IUEEBQ", "B00260HH2G", "B004499LTO", "B0038Z5SEM", "B000BTITKS", "B00441GYZG", "B000KLQUSU", "B000RL6GBO", "B004IFYMWK", "B0015XHP2C", "0767802497", "B007XF0XUW", "B0067EKYAY", "B00B04NIM2", "B002935GNC", "6304779178", "B00140PK82", "B00ARRQ9NI", "B00DU22OI6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0090EDEM8", "B000F6IOCA", "B0030E5PWQ", "B004MLEYUU"]}, "price": 17.15, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 177983}, "asin": "B000LPR6G0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51xw9g%2BmdLL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Flight of Fury"}
{"description": "Martin Scorsese makes a welcome return to the mean streets (of Boston, in this case) withThe Departed, hailed by many as Scorsese's best film sinceCasino. Since this crackling crime thriller is essentially a Scorsese-stamped remake of the acclaimed 2002 Hong Kong thrillerInfernal Affairs, the film was intensely scrutinized by devoted critics and cinephiles, and while Scorsese's intense filmmaking and all-star cast deserve ample acclaim,The Departedis also worthy of serious re-assessment, especially with regard to what some attentive viewers described as sloppy craftsmanship (!), notably in terms of mismatched shots and jagged continuity. But no matter where you fall on the Scorsese appreciation scale, there's no denying thatThe Departedis a signature piece of work from one of America's finest directors, designed for maximum impact with a breathtaking series of twists, turns, and violent surprises. It's an intricate cat-and-mouse game, but this time the cat and mouse are both moles: Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is an ambitious cop on the rise, planted in the Boston police force by criminal kingpin Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a hot-tempered police cadet who's been artificially disgraced and then planted into Costello's crime operation as a seemingly trustworthy soldier. As the multilayered plot unfolds (courtesy of a scorching adaptation byKingdom of Heavenscreenwriter William Monahan), Costigan and Sullivan conduct a volatile search for each other (they're essentially looking for \"themselves\") while simultaneously wooing the psychiatrist (Vera Farmiga) assigned to treat their crime-driven anxieties.Such convenient coincidences might sink a lesser film, butThe Departedis so electrifying that you barely notice the plot-holes. And while Nicholson's profane swagger is too much \"Jack\" and not enough \"Costello,\" he's still a joy to watch, especially in a film that's additionally energized by memorable (and frequently hilarious) supporting roles for Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg, and a host of other big-name performers.The Departedalso makes clever and plot-dependent use of cell-phones, to the extent that it couldn't exist without them. Powered by Scorsese's trademark use of well-chosen soundtrack songs (from vintage rock to Puccini's operas),The Departedmay not be perfect, but it's one helluva ride for moviegoers, proving popular enough to become the biggest box-office hit of Scorsese's commercially rocky career.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002ZG99N6", "B000P0J09M", "B004SIP7TE", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002ZG980U", "B002VWNIEA", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEBB8NI", "B002T9H2LA", "B00005JLSB", "B000MZHW40", "B00080ZG10", "B003ASLJQS", "B000P0J0AG", "B000P0J0EW", "B000C20VPA", "B003UESJHO", "B004SIP7ZS", "B003ASLJO0", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AHTYI5M", "B00275EGWY", "B000XR9L50", "B000A3XY5A", "B0007DFJ0G", "B001N44BVQ", "B00003CXWV", "B008MILL8W", "B000286RP2", "B004SIP7VM", "B00005V9HH", "6305313687", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004FQX5B6", "B00AEFXKUI", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEBB86A", "B005LAIIJY", "B0016Q2D66", "B003ASLJQI", "B00008975Z", "B000IY04Q8", "B001P9KR8U", "B00005JNJV", "B000C20VRS", "B008R65XYC", "B005LAIGRS", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00008DP4C", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00005JN0W", "B005LAIGLE", "B000A2UBN4", "B002QEHPQU", "B000P0J0EM", "B003UESJH4", "B007D5E7C2", "6304765258", "B000P0J0D8", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00004WG2F", "0767830555", "B000LC55F2", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B004EPYZP8", "B000A7DVR2", "B00005JPD0", "B000WZEZGI", "B00049QQHI", "B000FS9FCG", "B00004XPPB", "B006OFN0SE", "B009AMAL4Y", "B004U7MR14", "B000GFLKF8", "B003AWRMCE", "B0019L770A", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B0000AM6JI", "B004SIP9Z6", "B001GZ6QC4", "0783240295", "B0010DR4BO", "B000065U1N", "B00001ZWUS", "B00BB67UNW", "B0000B1OFL", "B00AEBB9K0", "B00DHDDE32", "B00005JKWX", "B0051MKNV8", "B002ZG97RE", "0767802519", "B0034G4P94", "B00DHHWXYY", "B00005B6JZ", "B00003CXZ4", "B001TODCII"], "bought_together": ["B000P0J09M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000RETOHY", "B000P0J09M", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEBB8NI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5067}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.5, "brand": "Warner Bros", "asin": "B000M341QE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RZnzpL34L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Brilliantly conceived, superbly directed, and beautifully acted,Babelis inarguably one of the best films of 2006. Director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and his co-writer, Guillermo Arriaga (the two also collaborated onAmores Perrosand21 Grams) weave together the disparate strands of their story into a finely hewn fabric by focusing on what appear to be several equally incongruent characters: an American (Brad Pitt) touring Morocco with his wife (Cate Blanchett) become the focus of an international incident also involving a hardscrabble Moroccan farmer (Mustapha Rachidi) struggling to keep his two young sons in line and his family together. A San Diego nanny (Adriana Barraza), her employers absent, makes the disastrous decision to take their kids with her to a wedding in Mexico. And a deaf-mute Japanese teen (the extraordinary Rinko Kikuchi) deals with a relationship with her father (Koji Yakusho) and the world in general that's been upended by the death of her mother. It is perhaps not surprising, or particularly original, that a gun is the device that ties these people together. YetBabelisn't merely about violence and its tragic consequences. It's about communication, and especially the lack of it--both intercultural, raising issues like terrorism and immigration, and intracultural, as basic as husbands talking to their wives and parents understanding their children. I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's command of his medium, sound and visual alike, is extraordinary; the camera work is by turns kinetic and restrained, the music always well matched to the scenes, the editing deft but not confusing, and the film (which clocks in at a lengthy 143 minutes) is filled with indelible moments. Many of those moments are also pretty stark and grim, and no will claim that all of this leads to a \"happy\" ending, but there is a sense of reconciliation, perhaps even resolution. \"If You Want to be Understood... Listen,\" goes the tagline. And if you want a movie that will leave you thinking,Babelis it.--Sam GrahamBeyondBabelOther Interweaving Storylines on DVDOther DVDs by Director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rrituWhy We Love Cate BlanchettStills fromBabel(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001CNRRU", "B00005N8A9", "B0041KKYF6", "B000A3XY5A", "B000F7CMRM", "B000067IZ3", "B00005JL57", "B00AEFXESQ", "B001P9KR8U", "B000N6TX1I", "B001JIE7JC", "B00005JPKE", "B00AEFXQ9S", "B00005JMJ4", "B0010DR4BO", "B000NIVJF4", "B000NIVJFY", "B000F1IQN2", "B00HF98SPS", "B0045ZAQRS", "B00011CZRE", "B000N3T0DW", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B000MZHW40", "B004SIP6VI", "B0034G4P30", "B008JFUNKU", "B003ASLJQS", "B000E1NXJ0", "B004SIP6GI", "B00AEBB89W", "B00275EGWY", "B000IONJM4", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00003CWTI", "B00080Z53O", "B00005JNCZ", "B00114XTHA", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00112S8RS", "B001PPLJIQ", "B000MXPE7O", "B00102F5WK", "B00121QGPY", "B0016Q2D66", "B002J1RZHE", "B008220DGE", "B000O76ZQC", "B0013XZ6X4", "B00080ZG10", "B00337KM2S", "B000286RP2", "B004SIP8ZM", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005JMJG", "B00005Q4CS", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B0036TGSJE", "B001TOD92C", "B000OY8NBK", "B004XVMCKS", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B00005JLRE", "B00005JH9M", "B00004WG2F", "B00AEBB8SS", "B00005JKJA", "B00H9HZITU", "B000YENUI6", "B0041KKYDI", "B001MZ5W3M", "B000N3SU92", "B000EQHXNW", "B0041KKYEM", "B001LLH8SE", "B0007TKOAA", "B000P0J0BK", "B002S5N052", "B004SIP7S0", "B00AEBB8NI", "B002SJIO4A", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B000E33VWW", "B000M341QE", "B002VWNICC", "B001NFNFNU", "6305313687", "B00005JKTF", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B00008K7AO", "B00DL48BM6", "079073639X", "B00H83EUQW", "B000FVQLRA", "B0002TT0MI", "B00AHTYI5M", "B00H9L26AA", "B00003CWRX", "B002FHGESI"], "bought_together": ["B00005N8A9", "B0041KKYF6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000A3XY5A", "B0001CNRRU", "B0041KKYF6", "B00G4Q3KOC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 100262}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.22, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B000MCH5P4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51poif023LL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Babel"}
