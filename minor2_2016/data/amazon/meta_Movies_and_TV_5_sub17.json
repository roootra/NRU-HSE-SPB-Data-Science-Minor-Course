{"description": "This television film based on the autobiographical novels of country veterinarian James Herriot predates the popular British TV series of the same name by several years. Shot on location in the picturesque Yorkshire countryside, it is utterly charming and features quite an illustrious cast. Academy Award-winning actor Sir Anthony Hopkins is terrific as the dedicated, exasperating Dr. Siegfried Farnon, who takes young Herriot, fresh out of a London veterinary college, on as his assistant.  Herriot is appealingly played by Simon Ward (perhaps best known as the Duke of Buckingham inThe Three Musketeers).  The movie opens as Herriot arrives for an interview with Farnon.  Dressed in his spotless Saville Row suit, Herriot is immediately swept along on a \"horse call\" and finds himself treating a messy injury.  This is the life that Herriot always dreamed of!  Like the series, the movie is a must for animal lovers.  (Yes, Mrs. Pumphrey is here with her pampered lap dog, Tricky Woo.)  It's also delightfully romantic, as it follows the courtship between Herriot and his bride-to-be, Helen (lovely Lisa Harrow).  Droll British humor and authentic period detail cap off a thoroughly satisfying production.--Laura Mirsky", "related": {"also_bought": ["0312330855", "B003DUBAXK", "0312206291"], "also_viewed": ["B003DUBAXK", "B003DUBAWQ", "0345434900"]}, "price": 36.97, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 340319}, "asin": "0764004719", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514Q4NA4AML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "All Creatures Great &amp; Small [VHS]"}

{"description": "Arguably the most intelligently written film to feature the masterful stop-motion animation of Ray Harryhausen,Jason and the Argonautsis a colorful adventure that takes full advantage of Harryhausen's \"Dynarama\" process. Inspired by the Greek myth, the story begins when the fearless explorer Jason (Todd Armstrong) returns to the kingdom of Thessaly to make his rightful claim to the throne, but the gods proclaim that he must first find the magical Golden Fleece. Consulting Hera, the queen of gods, Jason recruits the brave Argonauts to crew his ship, and they embark on their eventful journey. Along the way they encounter a variety of mythic creatures, including the 100-foot bronze god Talos, the batlike Harpies, the seven-headed reptilian Hydra, and an army of skeletons wielding sword and shield. This last sequence remains one of the finest that Harryhausen ever created, and it's still as thrilling as anything from the age of digital special effects. Harryhausen was the true auteur of his fantasy films, and his brilliant animation evokes a timeless sense of wonder.Jason and the Argonautsis a prime showcase for Harryhausen's talent--a wondrous product of pure imagination and filmmaking ingenuity.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001DB6J50", "0767847431", "B00004TJJV", "B002ZD3V10", "B00006JDRG", "B000062XE5", "B001DZOCY6", "B000QGEB1W", "B00007JMD8", "B00018D3ZA", "B00005LKHN", "B0045HCJSA", "B003DVNUUK", "B00005Y6XR", "B000SAGGL4", "B00005JKU0", "B000095WW6", "B00006AUGK", "B008XTVWHK", "B004B93RDS", "B0037JO0X4", "B000SFJ4K4", "B000FOPPEC", "B00AEBB8VK", "B0001BKBFC", "B000BMY2KG", "B0007R4T1W", "B00005JKFR", "B000VULA94", "B000AQKU72", "B0024FADBK", "B000O78KWE", "B0044O1Q60", "B000062XF2", "B0001NBMDK", "B000B7MX7A", "B000063UR0", "B00ALTQRUC", "B000HEWEDK", "B001BGS17Q", "B005OT7YX8", "B00004TJK0", "B005E7SFDI", "B000056AXZ", "B00007ELD2", "0783240961", "B000EHQTZO", "B00152VXUS", "B00005R1O8", "0783240953", "B000YDOOHI", "B00A33J8R0", "B00009NHC0", "B0024LIBDQ", "B00518A70E", "B0007R4T26", "B000A6T1ZE", "B0074JOUHE", "B0001I55XI", "B00D9EJFZA", "B002945DU2", "B000O78KY2", "B000Y2Q9J0", "B00AEBB94G", "B00005RRG7", "B0006B2A7E", "B00005JMH8", "B0045HCJKS", "6305869367", "B000FVQLKW", "B0006GANX2", "B000MGTQ7U", "6305761078", "B000056NWI", "B000AYELJ2", "B001AR0D40", "B005R2SHIS", "B00094ARW8", "B00A33J90G", "B000A9QK7I", "B00BQ7GU1Y", "B006TTC5J0", "B004FZWDPG", "B0002KPHW4", "0790742829", "B00B2M7DKA", "B004QF71ZW", "B0024FAG2G", "B00005JN8Z", "B00000F17E", "B003L7DK60", "B00006JMQG"], "bought_together": ["B001DB6J50", "0767847431"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001DB6J50", "0767847431", "B00004TJJV", "B002ZD3V10"]}, "price": 29.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12182}, "asin": "0767810864", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WNMTYA9qL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jason and the Argonauts"}

{"description": "For all of its conventional plotting about an obsessive-compulsive curmudgeon (Jack Nicholson) who improves his personality at the urging of his gay neighbor (Greg Kinnear) and a waitress (Helen Hunt) who inspires his best behavior, this is one of the sharpest Hollywood comedies of the 1990s. Nicholson could play his role in his sleep (the Oscar he won should have gone to Robert Duvall forThe Apostle), but his mischievous persona is precisely necessary to give heart to his seemingly heartless character, who is of all things a successful romance novelist. As a single mom with a chronically asthmatic young son, Hunt gives the film its conscience and integrity (along with plenty of wry humor), and she also won an Oscar for her wonderful performance. Greg Kinnear had to settle for an Oscar nomination (while cowriter-director James L. Brooks was inexplicably snubbed by Oscar that year), but his work was also singled out in the film's near-unanimous chorus of critical praise. It's questionable whether a romance between Hunt and the much older Nicholson is entirely believable, but this movie's smart enough--and charmingly funny enough--to make it seem endearingly possible.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001AVZA8", "B000YAF4MA", "0800141741", "B004FQX5B6", "B0000YEEGM", "B0038N9WKU", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00AEBB9WI", "B00005JLSK", "0783226845", "B0000AOV4I", "B000YDBPAM", "B000XJD33O", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00081U7HC", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00003CXFV", "B001ECDVK4", "6305212112", "B000EHRVOW", "B00009Y3PV", "6304765266", "B00004RJ73", "B005F2JRUC", "0783225733", "B00AEFXYOA", "6305236569", "B000OCZA04", "B000FFJYBG", "B003ASLJK4", "0792833198", "B000JYW5B4", "B00012QLB4", "B00BTYRB3U", "B0043X1FL8", "B000055Y0Y", "B00005B6JZ", "B000EHQU0S", "B00AEBB9UK", "B00008G7UF", "B0002B15ZG", "B00005JG6N", "B001MBTTNA", "B001ECDVJU", "B00003CWQR", "B00AEFY4CG", "630471193X", "B002GHHHP6", "B00AEBB9NM", "B0000A02TZ", "0767821769", "B00569I5BQ", "B00AEFYSWM", "B00AEFXYJA", "B000XT1P3E", "B002GHHHGU", "B00026ZG10", "6305128952", "B00005OLYF", "B001LMAK9W", "B000N6U0E2", "B000EMGJ7C", "B000023VTP", "B00CPTUOI2", "B004SIP9U6", "B00001ZWUS", "B003BV8ICC", "B0043X1FM2", "B0013XZ2QK", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00AEBB9FA", "B007SPPANM", "B00005JM4Q", "B007N31YH0", "B000VECAD0", "B00003CXO1", "B00009WVSL", "B00003CXSM", "B000NA1WDQ", "B00004BZIY", "B002AS464Q", "B000J103OI", "B000021Y7L", "B000ENC5YW", "B0002V7ON8", "B00009W5CA", "B00015YVDG", "B0009X75O2", "B0000JBALO", "0767803434", "6305065551", "B000MQC9H4", "6305692572", "B00013RC2U", "6305144168", "B00008979G", "B000CCBCAS", "0792846443", "B000M341QE"], "bought_together": ["B0001AVZA8", "B000YAF4MA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001AVZA8", "B0038N9WKU", "B000YAF4MA", "B00013WWT8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5469}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.96, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "0767811100", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KRRMHSAJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "As Good As It Gets"}

{"description": "Bugsyrepresents an almost miraculous combination of director, writer, and star on a project that represents a career highlight for everyone involved. It's one of the best American gangster movies ever made--as good in its own way as any of theGodfatherfilms--and it's impossible to imagine anyone better than Beatty in the movie's flashy title role. As notorious mobster and Las Vegas visionary \"Bugsy\" Siegel, Beatty is perfectly cast as a man whose dreams are greater than his ability to realize them--or at least, greater than his ability to stay alive while making those dreams come true. With a glamorous Hollywood mistress (Annette Bening) who shares Bugsy's dream while pursuing her own upwardly mobile agenda, Bugsy seems oblivious to threats when he begins to spend too much of the mob's money on the creation of the Flamingo casino. Meyer Lansky (Ben Kingsley) and Mickey Cohen (Harvey Keitel) will support Bugsy's wild ambition to a point, after which all bets are off, and Bugsy's life hangs in the balance. From the obvious chemistry of Beatty and Bening (who met and later married off-screen) to the sumptuous reproduction of 1940s Hollywood, every detail in this movie feels impeccably right. Beatty is simply mesmerizing as the man who invented Las Vegas but never saw it thrive, moving from infectious idealism to brutal violence in the blink of an eye. Director Barry Levinson is also in peak form here, guiding the stylish story with a subtle balance of admiration and horror; we can catch Bugsy's Vegas fever and root for the gangster's success, but we know he'll get what he deserves. We might wish that Bugsy had lived to see his dream turn into a booming oasis, but the movie doesn't suggest that we should shed any tears.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004U103", "B00013RC2U", "B004G7XCRQ", "B0000AMJEK", "B002954A4Q", "B007TBIUSM", "B00000JGHJ", "B000068QPV", "B0000DI87S", "B000E5KQHI", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000EHSVRI", "B000C20VPA", "B0010YVCI4", "B00008RH3L", "B001C0I61M", "B00004XPPB", "B000E8NRBC", "B00CMDPT3Q", "B000P0J09M", "0792838076", "6305297142", "0792846877", "B000GG4Y32", "B0019CUG02", "B000286RP2", "B002EAYDN4", "B004YCKKFK", "B008XTVWMU", "B002QEHPQU", "B004JKS996", "6305428522", "B000C1VAFG", "B0001EFV7C", "B00AEFY7NM", "B0007G89FK", "B00007G1YP", "B00080ZG10", "B001EKP5D2", "B00005JP93", "B008R65XYC", "B00005AA9C", "B00009Y3PV", "B00005T7I1", "B0000AM6JI", "B000N3T0H8", "B004FQX59I", "B00005V9HH", "B00005IA7Y", "B000C20VRS", "0792838068", "B002CPMB9O", "B00CCMKPO0", "B000063K2Q", "B008YAPRQK", "B000ERVKBC", "B002VWNICC", "B000P0J0AG", "B0006OEXTE", "B000NQPZCO", "B0018CMJSU", "B00AEFYTMQ", "B007NE08LM", "B00H9KKGTO", "B0006HBV3C", "B0002V7O5Q", "B00AEBB95K", "B001EIOOV8", "B0006GAOJA", "B00AEFXN9G", "0767830555", "B005S9ELVC", "B004SIP7TE", "B0006GANN2", "B0019UGYK0", "B00441GYPG", "B0009HMTGC", "B0064MT1FI", "B003HE4FAC", "B0003JANSW", "1451635672", "B00E96AZBK", "B000CNESTE", "B000M341QE", "B0006HBLUK", "B00007M57P", "B00005LC4D", "B0001FGBUW", "1467907898", "B007N31YH0", "B007UW9W5U", "B00BMJ7ZKG", "B00FRILRL6", "B00008975Z", "0792844831", "B0000542CB", "1607105829", "B001DW2BJW", "B000AQ69SG", "B00AEFXVOI"], "bought_together": ["B00004U103", "B0000AMJEK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002V7T0G", "B00004U103", "B00013RC2U", "B000EHSVRI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 217388}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.74, "brand": "", "asin": "0767818059", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XE61M6B7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bugsy"}

{"description": "Could this be the funniest movie ever made? By any rational measure of comedy, this medieval romp from the Monty Python troupe certainly belongs on the short list of candidates. According toLeonard Maltin's Movie & Video Guide, it's \"recommended for fans only,\" but we say hogwash to that--you could be a complete newcomer to the Python phenomenon and still find this send-up of the Arthurian legend to be wet-your-pants hilarious. It's basically a series of sketches woven together as King Arthur's quest for the Holy Grail, with Graham Chapman as the King, Terry Gilliam as his simpleton sidekick Patsy, and the rest of the Python gang filling out a variety of outrageous roles. The comedy highlights are too numerous to mention, but once you've seen Arthur's outrageously bloody encounter with the ominous Black Knight (John Cleese), you'll know that nothing's sacred in the Python school of comedy. From holy hand grenades to killer bunnies to the absurdity of the three-headed knights who say \"Ni--!,\" this is the kind of movie that will strike you as fantastically funny or just plain silly, but why stop there? It's all over the map, and the pace lags a bit here and there, but for every throwaway gag the Pythons have invented, there's a bit of subtle business or grand-scale insanity that's utterly inspired. The sum of this madness is a movie that's beloved by anyone with a pulse and an irreverent sense of humor. If this movie doesn't make you laugh, you're almost certainly dead.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000G6BLWE", "0767827724", "0792844890", "B00AEFXDO6", "B00003CXC3", "B0006JGNB0", "B0009XRZ92", "B000G6BLW4", "B002LFPAUC", "B000M7XR9W", "B00AMSQBUI", "B00AMSQBRQ", "B00000IQBW", "B006C9VR4Q", "B000055Y0X", "B000E6ESIK", "B00005PJ6O", "B000GEIRSM", "B000BMY2LU", "B00AEFYPAC", "B00287Z18Y", "B000V4UFZK", "1929780699", "B001AGXEAG", "B000P0J09W", "B0001Y4LBY", "6305428263", "B0089Q1TPM", "B008RNYMPG", "B001G5T6GW", "B00005ALS0", "B00AEFY3MC", "B004ALIG0G", "B0001ZX0O2", "B0009RCPY8", "B00006FDCT", "B001ECDVKE", "B00005PJ6N", "B002BIULL2", "B004SEUJBE", "B0000A14TA", "B00004RJ73", "B00006LPGP", "B00AEFXXMI", "B000NJMJGG", "B004QSQMKE", "B003AWRMBA", "B00AG473GE", "B000ELJAEM", "0800195175", "B00005JMYI", "B00177YA1K", "B00000K3D4", "B00AEBBA2C", "B002NZK5V4", "B003ASLJPE", "B004L9GMBC", "B000A283AW", "B005S9EK5Y", "B000QQLVPQ", "B000Z8GZYW", "B000EQHXOG", "B002NZK5SW", "B004SIPA4G", "B00AEBB9DM", "B0050FXDDQ", "B002G1K82Q", "B00000JPH6", "B000077VR3", "B007LNBS2I"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXC3"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000E6ESIK", "B00003CXC3"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 33308}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.82, "brand": "", "asin": "0767824571", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AAJB7EEQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Monty Python and the Holy Grail"}
{"description": "Best known forDeliverance(1972), John Boorman produced what is  arguably his greatest film withPoint Blank(1967). In that ambiguous gangster flick, set in a pastel L.A.  wasteland, Lee Marvin may or may not be a walking dead man, animated by the desire to avenge his fatal betrayal by the woman he loved and his best  friend. Many of Boorman's films take the form of quests, fueled by some dream  of utopia; on some level,Point Blankis the tragedy of a just man, appalled  and ultimately defeated by the complexity of his world's corruption.The Generalbegins with the death of Martin Cahill--celebrated Dublin gangster  who stole millions during the 1980s--then literally reverses the approach and  assault of his IRA assassin, flashing back in time, back through Cahill's  colorful, criminal quest for his kind of ideal community. Boorman says his  Cahill is a throwback to those Celtic chieftains of old who ruled by thievery  and violence; as an anachronism, this charming, brutal bear of a man  (perfectly incarnated by Brendan Gleeson) is undeniably reprehensible, but he  stands in deliberate contrast to the institutionalized hypocrisy and  corruption of church, state, and IRA alike. Brazenly hanging out in  police HQ to establish an alibi; maneuvering gracefully through perfectly  choreographed heists; dispensing affection to his wife, and her sister;  nailing the hands of a suspected cheat to a pool table; handing out food to women whose husbands are out of work--Gleeson's bluff, often comic gangster is always bigger than life, an eruption of unsocialized energy through the  layers-deep sediment of socially acceptable sin. (In real life as in the  film, Cahill always hid his face  under a sweatshirt hood, or behind his  spread fingers--he looks like some mischievous, giant-child.) Shot by the  great Seamus Deasey in color, then transferred to black-and-white stock,The  Generalis visually voluptuous, the anatomy of a charismatic monster's soul expressed in lustrous light, silken shades of gray, and ebony shadows.--Kathleen Murphy", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005WAP2V0", "B003UAKEBW", "B00005V1WP", "B003498SCQ", "B0002V7SOS", "B004XVMCQ2", "0783227906", "B0009G3BCY", "B0018BD9DA", "0783227329", "B000189LE2", "B00008DDHZ", "B004TPJN9Q", "B000JYW5AK", "B000AQKV1C", "B000OCY7JO", "0790729407", "B00000F3FS", "B001ADXX1E", "B00018D3L4", "B0000714BW", "B00007K02D", "B00DMDSC4S", "B004U7MR1Y", "B003LL3FIY", "B00IY1T8T6", "B00005JLR8", "B002U1LGSW", "B00260HH3U", "B00000ILEC", "B000GGSMC6", "B000QXDCLK", "B003T6LHWC", "B000XUOLQQ", "B005SYZZ7Q", "B004IY6A0S", "B007UW9W5U", "B00008RV0G", "B00005V9HK", "B00004TJKJ", "B0001EFV7C", "B00393SG56", "B003Y7F1M8", "B004ALIG1U", "B002U2Q0EG", "B002AMUDJY", "B002LYD2MG", "B00005QBZA", "B00018D40O", "B00004W5U6", "B007REV4LQ", "B005SH65G8", "B00005JN7T", "B000GIW9I2", "B009AMAL4Y", "B008H6GHE2", "B00F6SHGF8", "6305796297", "B000005IQX", "B000YENUI6", "B000CBG5PQ", "B004UVYQYQ", "B00FGVS07S", "0792163087", "B000063UQP", "B00B999E9O", "B000WPE8T2", "B0009GX1CE", "B005WKH3AI", "B000OCY7JE", "B003Y5H4R0", "B002XTXG1G", "B004W5MHL4", "B0000EYUBQ", "B00008DDVT", "B00D3DJIG8", "B00078XGRY", "B00BTYJYR6", "B007CEFTSA", "B000P6XU60", "B000X1Z0BU", "B0000SXK0E", "B00003CWSX", "B0014XVT98", "B00AEFY9GW", "B000093NQZ", "B00005B20H", "B000S8CLR4", "B00BJB2GRO", "B00BLF9FYA", "B0001GF2FQ", "B00097DY2A", "B000NOK0GW", "B000062XE6", "B008VF0XZ8", "B00009W5CA", "B00AQ5901E", "B000059HAE", "B002BWP3UC", "B004UVYQZA"], "bought_together": ["B005WAP2V0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005WAP2V0", "B001E18222", "B003UAKEBW", "0783227906"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 77130}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.99, "brand": "GLEESON,B/VOIGHT,J", "asin": "0767833600", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51kZ7m-s3ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The General"}
{"description": "This smart, tautly directed thriller from Wolfgang Petersen is about the cat-and-mouse games between a Secret Service agent named Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) and the brilliant, psychopathic assassin (John Malkovich) who's itching to get the President in his cross hairs. The back-story--Horrigan is haunted by his inability to prevent John Kennedy's assassination (Eastwood is computer-generated into archival footage)--is more than a little hokey, but the plotting itself is smartly, even ingeniously, constructed.

{"description": "Wes Craven's 1984 horror film is a better movie than it is generally credited for being. Forget the tawdry sequels; this highly original, almost surrealist work stars Robert Englund as a mutilated monster who kills teenagers during their dreams. Craven, who only directed one Elm Street sequel (Wes Craven's New Nightmare), takes the Hitchcockian step of layering in psychological explanations for the terror and then proving them all irrelevant in the face of mindless evil. The horror in the film is emotionally raw, in contrast to the overimaginative set pieces of most of the sequels that followed; and the final scene is as deeply unsettling as anything Luis Bu&ntilde;uel ever committed to film.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300214087", "B00023NRSM", "B0000039A6", "B00000JQTO", "6302975832", "6303396585", "630018403X", "0792836634", "0784011923", "0790700506", "B00000JQTR", "6301589025", "6302166926", "6300182878", "6301961404", "6300263681", "B00005JA8B", "6300184269", "6300267881", "6300214311", "6305095566", "B00000JQTQ", "0790742322", "B0000VCZMU", "0780607287", "0790705141", "6300214192", "6300214605", "6303506291", "0792839234", "630026999X", "6302921058", "0783235607", "6304509154", "6304288433", "B00000ILE6", "6300214656", "6300218058", "6302038308", "6301094352", "6302968143", "B00000JGEI", "6303257879", "6303265693", "0792846303", "630428845X", "6300247171", "B000005XXG"], "bought_together": ["6300214087", "B00023NRSM"], "also_viewed": ["0792836634", "B000BRKTL2", "0780627032", "B00023NRSM", "6300214087", "B000RIWAVW", "B0000039A6", "6302921058", "6302975832", "B00005LC4Q", "B000FA57UI", "6303396585", "0790705141", "B00AZ7V0W0", "B0089N4G50", "B00000JQTO", "6300182878", "0790700506", "6304288433", "B000FA57US", "6305095566", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B000VKL6Z2", "6301792769", "B001DJLD1W", "630428845X", "6300214192", "6304983794", "B00D7AM71A", "B000FS9FE4", "6304509154", "630229648X", "6301792734", "B00DEQQK8S", "6303265693", "0767817664", "B000RRJOPS", "6303257879", "0780630858", "B00000K3TO", "6301961404", "6304240562", "0783235607", "B0000VCZMU", "B0001611DI", "6301708695", "0780630866", "6300247171", "B00004SVYQ", "B00FN5Z8UY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 392902}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.92, "brand": "", "asin": "0780619412", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BTBTJRFDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Nightmare on Elm Street [VHS]"}

{"description": "The mind-bending worlds of author H.P. Lovecraft have long interested horror directors, but the films have rarely successfully captured his nightmarish mix of madness and mythology. John Carpenter'sIn the Mouth of Madnessis not directly based on Lovecraft's work, but screenwriter Michael De Luca draws his inspiration from Lovecraft's Cthulu mythology and then adds his own ingenious twists. John Trent (Sam Neill), an insurance investigator recently fitted for a straightjacket, tells his story to a psychiatrist. Hired to track down the missing pop-horror phenomena Sutter Cane, a Stephen King-like author whose fans are literally made for his books, Trent finds the supposedly fictional Hobb's End.  He watches the town collapse into madness, murder, and monstrous transformations: the fantastic horrors of Cane's novels played out in front of his eyes. \"Reality isn't what it used to be,\" deadpans one zombielike townsperson. In fact, it is how Cane writes it--but is he Devil, dark oracle, or simply a preacher in the service of an evil that grows stronger with every soul his books convert? The script never quite gets a grip on the blurry relationship between fact and fiction, but those details fade in the face of Carpenter's demented imagery, shiver-inducing twists, and dark wit.

{"description": "Originally broadcast in April and May of 1998, the epic miniseriesFrom the Earth to the Moonwas HBO's most expensive production to date, with a budget of $68 million. Hosted by executive producer Tom Hanks, the miniseries tackles the daunting challenge of chronicling the entire history of NASA'sApollospace program from 1961 to 1972. For the most part, it's a rousing success. Some passages are flatly chronological, awkwardly wedging an abundance of factual detail into a routine dramatic structure. But each episode is devoted to a crucial aspect of the Apollo program. The cumulative effect is a deep and thorough appreciation of NASA's monumental achievement. With the help of a superlative cast, consistent writing, and a stable of talented directors, Hanks has shared his infectious enthusiasm for space exploration and the inspiring power of conquering the final frontier.NASA's complete participation in the production lends to its total authenticity, right down to the use of NASA equipment, launch locations, and even spacecraft. The re-creation of the lunar landscape is almost as impressive as the real thing and is further enhanced by the use of helium balloons to lighten the actors playing moon-walking astronauts. (These and other backstage details are revealed in the \"making of\" featurette, along with a wealth of supplemental materials, on a bonus disc in the miniseries' DVD package.) With a fictional, Walter Cronkite-like TV reporter (Lane Smith) serving as the dramatic link for all 12 episodes, this ambitious production may not be a great work of art. But as a generous and definitive example of nonfiction drama, it's full of the same kind of awe, inspiration, and humanity that led to \"one giant leap\" in the all-too-short history of 20th-century space exploration.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000XJ5TPE", "B001BEK8CY", "B004GJYRI2", "B0026IQTR2", "0783225733", "014311235X", "B000V7O0DU", "B00E2083J4", "B0002TSZQ0", "1439148813", "B00371QQ2U", "1588342735", "B0026VBOIS", "B0006FYOTC", "B0026VBOJC", "0395670292", "0670020788", "B003NOGNPQ", "B00004U2MS", "0374531943", "0525945717", "1453258264", "B00080ETMM", "0307262928", "B00FA8Y2OW", "B004ODLUF8", "B000002OW6", "0312427565", "0060194162", "1613749015", "B001DE29SI", "B00008MTVZ", "074325631X", "0307463451", "0151004676", "B00IWULSTC", "0743200799", "0375406344", "B00IWULQQ2", "0062296086", "0867130504", "0618619585", "B00008G8LY", "B004GWVQGA", "B00D7AM2GA", "B002GHHHKQ", "B005QW98AK", "B001IBIHQ4", "B00H83EV5W", "B00006CXSS", "0792838408", "B001YV504U", "B00AZMFJYA", "B000055ZOB", "B00129H7VS", "B004AOECXI", "B008FD36IC", "0316253014", "B000LXGXY8", "B004AR4WSA", "B00HWWUQYY"], "bought_together": ["B004GJYRI2", "0783225733"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001BEK8CY", "0783225733", "B000XJ5TPE", "B004GJYRI2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 111613}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 87.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0783114222", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41HVKCSFH1L._SX300_.jpg", "title": "From the Earth to the Moon (Four Disc Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "Director Ernest Dickerson injects a hearty dose of dark humor in this stylish comic-book horror tale. Based on the campy cable horror series (which was inspired by the 1950s E.C. comic book series of the same name), this tight, modestly budgeted little thriller stars William Sadler as an intense stranger who arrives at a run-down boarding house in flight from the Collector (a cocky, droll Billy Zane). The Collector is after an item in the stranger's possession, which turns out to be a holy relic, and when his efforts end in failure he explodes in a demonic fury that reveals his evil origins, laying siege to the house with an army of zombies and infiltrating the minds of each the boarders with insidious fantasies. It's a seedyGrand Hotelby way ofThe Exorcist, cooked up with plenty of gore and a smattering of sex, and served with dry wit.

The story (ifDunecan be said to have just one story) is complex and convoluted in the epic tradition; it has something to do with political intrigue and a planet that is home to a precious spice and gigantic sand worms. Think Shakespeare'sHenry IVwith a dash ofTremors, and set in another galaxy. But despite plenty of strangely whispered voice-overs that explain the characters' thoughts (and endlessly detailed exposition), storytelling is not really among the film's strong points. There are, however, a lot of memorably fantastic/grotesque images, an extraordinary cast, and a soundtrack featuring Toto. I told you it was weird.

{"description": "After the global phenomenon that wasJurassic Park, it was a given that novelist Michael Crichton would conjure up a sequel and that Steven Spielberg would then commit it to film. Considering the potential profit involved, it was practically a commercial mandate. Perhaps it was inevitable that both efforts were contrived, and well below the talents of Crichton (well, maybe) and certainly Spielberg, who just didn't have the heart for this recycling after the artistic triumph ofSchindler's List. What we're left with, for better and worse, is a redundant blockbuster that still benefits from Spielberg's mastery of high-intensity action sequences and the further development of amazing computer-generated special effects. What's missing is the awe and wonder that madeJurassic Parka technical marvel and a dazzling product of scientific imagination. The story's a no-brainer: after the deadly fiasco of the original dinosaur theme park, we're taken (along with returning star Jeff Goldblum) to a second island where genetically engineered dinosaurs still thrive under the watchful eye of Goldblum's biologist girlfriend (Julianne Moore). But a devious capitalist (Arliss Howard) is determined to export dinosaurs to a new park in San Diego, financing a hunt-and-capture expedition that results in another series of fatal disasters. In Spielberg's hands this movie's more exciting than it has a right to be, given the creative paucity of Crichton's novel and David Koepp's adapted screenplay. The special effects are state-of-the-art, and the T-Rex's rampage through the streets of San Diego is nothing short of spectacular; but apparently an improvement upon the shortcomings ofJurassic Parkwas too much to hope for.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CXXR", "6303148352", "0788805533", "6301666569", "6304290888", "6303506291", "0783216084", "6304169558", "6303212379", "B0000524CZ", "B0000048S1", "B00006FDFG", "6304155972", "0788811002"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXXR", "6303148352"], "also_viewed": ["B00B4804KS", "B0087ZG7J8", "6303148352", "B0057R5XRG", "B00003CXXR", "0788812408", "078881172X", "080010367X", "6304015127", "630157401X", "6303486894", "B00000JGEI", "630021463X", "6303215734", "6300215830", "6302320402", "6304089767", "6305750750", "B00005JM5E", "6303314015", "6302642248", "B000LPS4BG", "079213690X", "B008M4MB8K", "B007LNBS2I", "B00HWWUQWQ"]}, "price": 25.93, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 670881}, "asin": "0783223358", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FZH56FA4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lost World: Jurassic Park [VHS]"}
{"description": "Director Martin Scorsese reunites with members of hisGoodFellasgang (writer Nicholas Pileggi; actors Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Frank Vincent) for a three-hour epic about the rise and fall of mobster Sam &quot;Ace&quot; Rothstein (De Niro), a character based on real-life gangster Frank &quot;Lefty&quot; Rosenthal. (It's modeled after onWiseguyandGoodFellasand Pileggi's true crime bookCasino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas.)  Through Rothstein, the picture tells the story of how the Mafia seized, and finally lost control of, Las Vegas gambling. The first hour plays like a fascinating documentary, intricately detailing the inner workings of Vegas casinos. Sharon Stone is the stand out among the actors; she nabbed an Oscar nomination for her role as the voracious Ginger, the glitzy call girl who becomes Rothstein's wife. The film is not as fast paced or gripping as Scorsese's earlier gangster pictures (Mean StreetsandGoodFellas), but it's still absorbing. And, hey--it's Scorsese!--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000P0J09M", "B000C20VRS", "B00004XPPB", "B000P0J0AG", "B0000AM6JI", "B0006GAOJA", "B0019L770A", "B0019L21GA", "B00003CXWV", "0767830555", "B000286RP2", "B0018CMJSU", "B000M341QE", "B004SIP7TE", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AEBB9NM", "B00004U103", "B0000DI87S", "B00008975Z", "B00013RC2U", "B00CCMKPO0", "B0019L21H4", "B000A2UBN4", "B006TTC5HC", "B004SIP95G", "B007TBIUSM", "B002QEHPQU", "B000H5TH20", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005V9HH", "B00G1C2URC", "B00011CZRE", "B002VWNIEA", "B002T9H2LA", "B0000AMJEK", "B0001FGBUW", "B000P0J0EW", "B000A7DVR2", "6305313687", "B004G7XCRQ", "B000P0J0D8", "B000LP6KNU", "B0007DFJ0G", "1558908390", "B000P0J09C", "B00080ZG10", "B00005B6JZ", "B000CNESTE", "B004FQX5B6", "B000067IZ3", "B004U7MR14", "0783229526", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00008RH3L", "B0018CWW5K", "B002CA68N4", "B00562D3Y2", "B006X08FGW", "B007D5E7C2", "B000SFOW8I", "B008R65XYC", "B00005ATQB", "B00001ZWUS", "B000EHSVRI", "B00AEFXESQ", "B0009A40ES", "B002ZG99N6", "B003ELKNH2", "B000OT6V0K", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000002OZ9", "B000MZHW40", "B00AEFXKUI", "B004L9GMBC", "B00006RCNV", "B000PAAJZ6", "B001JIE7JC", "B00AEBB95K", "B004SIP93S", "B000E5KQHI", "B00IEK9U0E", "B0000AMRJE", "B000ZM1MGE", "B000QEIOT4", "B0041QSZS8", "B000093FLA", "B0000YEE6M", "B002VWNIDG", "B00029RTAI", "B002NZK5QO", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00079Z9VO", "B00AEBB8LA", "B007SPPANM", "B000035Z5G", "B00004XPPG", "079284646X", "B000FI8MPW", "B003AWRMCE", "B00AEFY0F2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000P0J09M", "B000C20VRS", "B008R65XYC", "B000M341QE"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 158336}, "asin": "0783225792", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/712YQJ017YL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Casino"}

Oscar winner Emma Thompson co-stars in this gripping film the Los Angeles Times calls, \"A politically charged 'Fugitive.'\" In the Name of the Father tells the true saga of Gerry Conlon.  A petty thief in strife-torn '70s Belfast, Gerry's main interests are getting drunk and partying, much to the dismay of his quiet, frail father Giuseppe (Pete Postlethwaite). When Gerry angers the IRA, his father sends him to England, where his antics land him in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Innocent, but forced to confess to a savage terrorist bombing, he is sentenced to life imprisonment as one of the \"Guildford Four.\"  An innocent Giuseppe is also arrested and jailed, and while behind bars, Gerry slowly learns that his father's seeming weakness masks an unmatched inner strength and wisdom. Working with a fiercely dedicated lawyer (Thompson), Gerry determines to prove his innocence, clear his father's name and expose the truth behind one of the most shameful legal events in recent history.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783227329", "B004U7MR1Y", "B000OCY7JO", "0790729407", "B00005V1WP", "B004TPJN9Q", "B007UW9W5U", "B003498SCQ", "B00008DDHZ", "B0009VRHNI", "B004499LWG", "B000005IQX", "B00013F2S6", "B004XVMCQ2", "B0009G3BCY", "B00B5A9FL4", "B000CBG5PG", "B0002V7SOS", "B00007K02D", "B004SIP7TE", "B000AQKV1C", "B00000ILEC", "0452272785", "0767833600", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00005JLR8", "B00000F3FS", "0767802578", "B00008R9KF", "B00004TJKJ", "B000CBG5PQ", "B000A2WP7O", "B002YMWPUA", "B000EHSVQO", "B000189LE2", "B001FB55OE", "B009YX8MSG", "B00078XGRY", "B001ADXX1E", "B000056BP3", "B005WAP2V0", "0783231202", "B00004W5U6", "B005SH65G8", "B003LL3FIY", "0800141806", "B00B5A9FP0", "B000X1Z0BU", "B00004TJKI", "B00DMDSC4S", "B00J5G1P2W", "B00J5LXT44", "087113702X", "B00009W5CA", "B000063US3", "B00441GYPG", "B0006Z2NAY", "B006TTC5HC", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B004IY6A0S", "B00IBKXQJS", "B000KX0IOA", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00CX7OWWA", "B00003CXC9", "B00005MEOU", "B0064MT1FI", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00K6D1QV8", "B0001DCYUU", "B0002V7ON8", "B000JYW5AK", "B0007PALZ2", "B002VWNICC", "B0002CR04A", "B0000714BW", "B00005B6JZ", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B000EHRVOM", "B009AMANBA", "B006FE83UE", "B002LYD2MG", "B0049BKOIY", "6304696515", "630542828X", "B0045HCJ8K", "B000LPR6GA", "B004FQX59I", "B000GG4Y32", "B00G15MDI0", "B00005JKG9", "B000H5TH20", "0767812158", "B00AEFXBPM", "B0057ZAA6W", "B001AMH7XA", "B004SUDQ72", "B000059TFO", "B00008DDVT", "0784011710"], "bought_together": ["B004U7MR1Y", "0783227329"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0790729407", "B000OCY7JO", "B004U7MR1Y", "B000005IQX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17197}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.95, "brand": "LEWIS,DANIEL DAY", "asin": "0783227906", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2BVccNfwrL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "In the Name of the Father"}

{"description": "Paul Newman and Julie Andrews star in what must unfortunately be called one of Alfred Hitchcock's lesser efforts. Still, sub-par Hitchcock is better than a lot of what's out there, and this one is well worth a look. Newman plays cold war physicist Michael Armstrong, while Andrews plays his lovely assistant-and-fianc&eacute;e, Sarah Sherman. Armstrong has been working on a missile defense system that will \"make nuclear defense obsolete,\" and naturally both sides are very interested. All Sarah cares about is the fact that Michael has been acting awfully fishy lately. The suspense ofTorn Curtainis by nature not as thrilling as that in the average Hitchcock film--much of it involves sitting still and wondering if the bad guys are getting closer. Still, Hitchcock manages to amuse himself: there is some beautifully clever camera work and an excruciating sequence that illustrates the frequent Hitchcock point that death is not a tidy business.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002IXSVI", "6300183513", "0790743213", "6300181340", "0783235682", "6300183580", "6301670159", "B000UVV25Q", "6301640667", "0783235615", "6300268748", "0783235607", "0783235674", "6301670140", "0783236352", "0783221347", "0783235593", "6301798503", "6303562248", "6301798759", "B000007NPV", "6301800974", "0783235623", "6300270386", "6303120474", "6304152450", "0800132009", "6301965760", "6303451535", "B00004RFFA", "B00000FZXC", "0782008348", "6300181529", "0792107683", "6300216217", "6305012792"], "bought_together": ["B0002IXSVI"], "also_viewed": ["B00BWJQEC6", "B00ARA4SLU", "B000CCW2TS", "B00F0IRN7U", "B001D8W7EK", "B00AQMGQVY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 233901}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.39, "brand": "", "asin": "0783235704", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WFN1SW9TL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Torn Curtain [VHS]"}
{"description": "Anyone who has seen and loved Neil Jordan'sThe Company of Wolvesshould feel  right at home in his off-beat psychological thrillerIn Dreams. A sexy, very  adult take on \"Little Red Riding Hood,\"Wolvesunreeled as a series of  surreal \"fairy tales\" interwoven within the heated dreams of a young girl  verging on womanhood.Wolves' patron saints were Freud and Jung (as sifted  through Jordan's wickedly fertile imagination), and the duo are very much aboard forIn Dreamsas well.  Here's a movie that takes place entirely in dreamtime,  where the dark, violent fantasies of Claire Cooper (Annette Bening)--wife,  mother, and illustrator of children's books--play out unpoliced by superego,  conscience, or society. On the face of it, Claire's a clairvoyant whose mind  becomes more and more possessed by child-killer Vivian Thompson (Robert  Downey Jr.). Cops and shrinks refuse to take her seriously until she loses  her own daughter and much, much more. Tapping into weird images of her  soulmate's childhood, when he was abused by a hateful mother in a house now submerged in a nearby reservoir, Claire comes closer and closer to her  gender-shifting bad boy (and his latest victim). From start to finish,In  Dreamsdwells in hyperreality. Whether leeched of or drenched in color, slipping eerily through an underwater world, rushing madly toward  catastrophe--every hallucinatory shot is saturated with menace. It's the kind  of potent, unresolved menace that haunts your waking day after a particularly  unsettling nightmare. Watch this gorgeous film as therapeutic (?) theater  inside Claire's mind, where she and her murderous doppelganger act out a  terrible Oedipal drama driven by sex and jealousy. Bening and Downey deliver  superb, risky performances, and Darius Khondji's cinematography, with almost  every frame punctuated by blood-reds, is sensuously dreamlike.In Dreamsis  one of those great, flawed films that reaches for more than it ultimately  achieves. But what a welcome change from the dullness and shallowness of the  formulaic sure things that dominate movie screens as the 20th century draws to a close.--Kathleen Murphy", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001FR3IQ", "B004YCKJNI", "B000NO1XG8", "B0000DD76U", "B000KB489I", "B00064AFK0", "B0071HPP1Y", "B00004W21Z", "B00JPQ1I7O", "B0002DB54A", "B00005Y1UV", "B00D2UMHGA", "B000F5GNX8", "B00003CXDJ", "B000BBOUW2", "0783230079", "B000JMK6LW", "0800177789", "B00008L3S6", "B004ALIG4W", "B002OGMGV4", "B003VA3JUO", "B004SUDQ22", "B0000648X0", "B00AEFYC96", "B00BEIYMAG", "B002AT8KAG", "0688124402", "B000RO9Q7W", "B00AEFY31S", "B00AEFY2WI", "B002NZK5RI", "B00003CWRF", "B000I2J736", "B00022S7EC", "B000QXDCLA", "B00J0IN6Z4", "B00DW5IL2E", "B00005JH9M", "B00CX7TOOG", "B00DW5IJR6", "B007UW9W5U", "B000EU1ONS", "B00008L3UM", "B00AEBBA2W", "B0037QGS0A", "B000069HZP", "B002NPY7F4", "0783237413", "B00003CXKM", "B00005O5AX", "B0006IIKQW", "B001DE29SS", "B0000A1HR4", "B009XTF8KQ", "B001DB6J6Y", "184358185X", "B004SUDQ8G", "B00001U0DU", "B000X1CQJ4", "B0009298N4", "B0027VTMAE", "B001BPB5YI", "B00AEFYXQI", "6305238065", "B00AEFY37C", "B0000694XY", "B0051CSIKQ", "B003ZHR6T8", "6304884370", "B00AEFY2LO", "B004P3ENLA", "B007IJKQRS", "B00006L91I", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B000U1ZV44", "B0002HOEPI", "B0097C0AUC", "B00000K3TU", "6305133409", "0790730979", "B00BTYOYGW", "B00008DDVY", "0767807588", "B0045NXMJE", "B0007WQHI0", "B00AEFXPG2", "B0002DB52M", "B000OYC7BW", "B00013RC7K", "B00175VSBC", "B0021L8UG2", "B0043X1FNQ", "B002GHHHG0", "B00E1HIWXU", "B00005JL3T", "B004EPYZO4", "B0002C4JJ4", "B00AEFXKZ8"], "bought_together": ["B0001FR3IQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0071HPP1Y", "B00AEBBA2W", "B001BPB5YI", "B0001FR3IQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 136034}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 16.99, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "0783235410", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71EZ8HJ90ML._SY300_.gif", "title": "In Dreams"}

Ada travels with her daughter Flora (Anna Paquin) and her beloved piano to a remote spot on the coast of New Zealand for an arranged marriage to a farmer (Sam Neill). She gives piano lessons to a gruff neighbor (Harvey Keitel) who has Maori tattoos on his face, and, well, things develop from there.

Jessica Lange stars as a Chicago criminal attorney whose beloved immigrant father (Armin Mueller-Stahl, in his American film debut) is accused of once having been a monstrous SS officer for Hitler. While Lange's character does a good job defending the old man in court against witnesses who charge him with numerous unspeakable acts, her own certainty that  he is innocent slowly crumbles, leaving her with a horrifying personal dilemma. Directed by Costa-Gavras (Z), the film displays some of his distracting tendency toward unnecessarily broad storytelling, but Eszterhas's script is disciplined and moving, and Lange and Mueller-Stahl are stunning in their depiction of a loving relationship deeply shaken by history.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00006349J"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 488600}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.96, "brand": "", "asin": "0784011486", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31BE03EB0SL.gif", "title": "Music Box [VHS]"}

{"description": "It always comes up when people are comparing their most traumatic movie experiences: \"the death of Bambi's mother,\" a recollection that can bring a shudder to even the most jaded filmgoer. That primal separation (which is no less stunning for happening off-screen) is the centerpiece ofBambi, Walt Disney's 1942 animated classic, but it is by no means the only bold stroke in the film. In its swift but somehow leisurely 69 minutes,Bambicovers a year in the life of a young deer. But in a bigger way, it measures the life cycle itself, from birth to adulthood, from childhood's freedom to grown-up responsibility. All of this is rendered in cheeky, fleet-footed style--the movie doesn't lecture, or make you feel you're being fed something that's good for you. The animation is miraculous, a lush forest in which nature is a constantly unfolding miracle (even in a spectacular fire, or those dark moments when \"man was in the forest\"). There are probably easier animals to draw than a young deer, and the Disney animators set themselves a challenge with Bambi's wobbly glide across an ice-covered lake, his spindly legs akimbo; but the sequence is effortless and charming. If Bambi himself is just a bit dull--such is the fate of an Everydeer--his rabbit sidekick Thumper and a skunk named Flower more than make up for it. Many of the early Disney features have their share of lyrical moments and universal truths, butBambiis so simple, so pure, it's almost transparent. You might borrow a phrase from Thumper and say it's downright twitterpated.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["155890641X", "0788812807", "6302642248", "0788802194", "6302320402", "6304401132", "078881172X", "6304500831", "6303314015", "6300274195", "0788812408", "6302526574", "6302787068", "6302961572", "6300274268", "6305229449", "6303983812", "0788803743", "6304089767", "B0000AQZYM", "B000035Z2S", "6305319138", "6300275310", "0788805843", "0788805533", "6303929338", "6302158095", "6302178924", "6304100507", "B00005JKDQ", "6304400551", "6305326940", "6304290888", "6304978286", "6304400225", "6305940932", "B00004R99N", "6303036813", "6301390725", "B00003CX7L", "B0000E32WB", "6304089201", "B00000ICHA", "B000B8QG3G", "B0000524CZ", "6302426200", "6304501153", "B00003CXQX", "B00005T7H6", "1558906150", "6300274608", "B00000JS61", "6303534422", "B0009SUS4Q", "6304400381", "B00004R99I", "B000009CTR", "6302484359", "6301991311", "B00005RDVV", "B0007A2GSM", "B00003CXHR", "0788811002", "B000035Z46", "B00005RRG3", "6300276554", "6303122647", "6303123244", "6304401736", "0788812181", "B00006IUM9", "1558901892", "6301948106", "6305942285", "6300277003", "B00003CWPW", "6304015127", "B00007AJLB", "B00005JL95", "0788810634", "6304873441", "6303295614", "6303939015", "0783236689", "6304117752", "B00016JF2W", "B000BAVLYS", "0788812440", "B0002YLCHE", "6302481805", "6304155972", "6303991408", "B00008Y47S", "B00003CXXI", "B000B8QG4A", "6302961661", "B00003CXQ6", "B0001I55VK", "B00004YNUH"], "bought_together": ["155890641X", "0788802194"], "also_viewed": ["155890641X", "0788802194", "6303314015", "0788812408", "6304500831", "6302526574", "6302320402", "078881172X", "6302642248", "6302787068", "0788812807", "6300274195", "6304401132", "6302961572", "6304089767", "6300274268", "0788805843", "B000035Z2S", "6304290888", "0788805533", "6305319138", "6303983812", "6305229449", "6303929338", "6300275310", "6302178924", "6304400551", "B0000AQZYM", "6302158095", "6303534422", "B00005JKDQ", "B0007KTBIU", "6305326940", "B00003CXQX", "6304501153", "6303036813", "B000B8QG3G", "6304100507", "B00004R99N", "6305940932", "B00003CXHR", "6304978286", "B000035Z46", "B00005JL95", "B00005RDVV", "B005JQFQ5Y", "B00003CX7L", "6304873441", "6304089201", "6304400225", "6302426200", "6301991311", "6304401736", "0788811002", "B0000524CZ", "6300274608", "6301390725", "B00016JF2W", "B00004REYY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 63167}, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Children's Music", "Disney"], ["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.94, "brand": "Disney", "asin": "0788806270", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DVF3SBVRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bambi (Walt Disney's Masterpiece) [VHS]"}
{"description": "Robin Williams won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, and actors Matt Damon and Ben Affleck nabbed one for Best Original Screenplay, but the feel-good hitGood Will Huntingtriumphs because of its gifted director, Gus Van Sant. The unconventional director (My Own Private Idaho,Drugstore Cowboy) saves a script marred by vanity and clunky character development by yanking soulful, touching performances out of his entire cast (amazingly, even one by Williams that's relatively schtick-free). Van Sant pulls off the equivalent of what George Cukor accomplished for women's melodrama in the '30s and '40s: He's crafted an intelligent, unabashedly emotional male weepie about men trying to find inner-wisdom.Matt Damon stars as Will Hunting, a closet math genius who ignores his gift in favor of nightly boozing and fighting with South Boston buddies (co-writer Ben Affleck among them). While working as a university janitor, he solves an impossible calculus problem scribbled on a hallway blackboard and reluctantly becomes the prodigy of an arrogant MIT professor (Stellan Skarsg&#229;rd). Damon only avoids prison by agreeing to see psychiatrists, all of whom he mocks or psychologically destroys until he meets his match in the professor's former childhood friend, played by Williams. Both doctor and patient are haunted by the past, and as mutual respect develops, the healing process begins. The film's beauty lies not with grand climaxes, but with small, quiet moments. Scenes such as Affleck's clumsy pep talk to Damon while they drink beer after work, or any number of therapy session between Williams and Damon offer poignant looks at the awkward ways men show affection and feeling for one another.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FVQLQQ", "B000P0J0EW", "6305144168", "B0043X1FL8", "B00000IQV7", "B00AEFY0F2", "B0000YEEGM", "B00JPQ1INI", "B004FQX5B6", "0800141741", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00562D3Y2", "B00125WAWS", "0783226845", "B003ASLJQS", "B00005JLRZ", "B000M341QE", "B0034G4P7G", "B002ZG99N6", "B000N4RAR4", "0767811100", "6305428352", "B000P0J0EM", "B00009W5CA", "B002NZK5UK", "B003ASLJO0", "B00003CWQR", "B004SIP7VM", "B000B8QG22", "B00005V9HH", "B001F34HRS", "B004AOECXI", "B000N6U0E2", "B00AEFXYJA", "079284646X", "B0043X1FM2", "B00AEFY17E", "B000066HAS", "B000PHVZNE", "B003AWRMC4", "B00000G3PA", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00005JKWX", "B000MZHW40", "B000Z8GZYW", "B0018CWW5K", "B000P0J0C4", "B000P0J09M", "B00004BZIY", "B00B0U2SFE", "B003AWRMCE", "B00001ZWUS", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005B6JZ", "B00005JLSB", "B0002ZDVEU", "6305428271", "B000FKO5QK", "B00AEBB9SM", "B00007GZR5", "B001SN78JO", "B000QQLVPQ", "630587493X", "B0001ADAVK", "B004WCTLNY", "0792843592", "B00AEBBA36", "B000FVQLRA", "B00AEFXXMI", "B000XJD33O", "B0002WZTOI", "B00004XPPG", "B00008G8M4", "B00AEBB9LO", "B000056VP4", "B006VRRGNK", "6305313687", "B0006FYOTC", "B001QERPAC", "B002O3Z4WK", "B001680M26", "B00AEFY4CG", "B000YDBPAM", "B0068FZ0GK", "0767836359", "B00005JN2Z", "B000765IJK", "B00008NFR4", "630471193X", "B002NZK5VO", "B000EGDB10", "B000068MBX", "B00000J122", "B00AMSLDTM", "B000MNOX94", "B000R4SMCW", "B00009AOBI", "B000XR9L50", "B00005JOC9"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000P0J0EW", "B000M341QE", "0783226845", "B002ZG99N6"]}, "price": 8.67, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 107799}, "asin": "0788814664", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EQNMPT51L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Good Will Hunting"}

{"description": "Martin Scorsese's 1990 masterpieceGoodFellasimmortalizes the hilarious, horrifying life of actual gangster Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), from his teen years on the streets of New York to his anonymous exile under the Witness Protection Program. The director's kinetic style is perfect for recounting Hill's ruthless rise to power in the 1950s as well as his drugged-out fall in the late 1970s; in fact, no one has ever rendered the mental dislocation of cocaine better than Scorsese. Scorsese uses period music perfectly, not just to summon a particular time but to set a precise mood.GoodFellasis at least as good asThe Godfatherwithout being in the least derivative of it. Joe Pesci's psycho improvisation of Mobster Tommy DeVito ignited Pesci as a star, Lorraine Bracco scores the performance of her life as the love of Hill's life, and every supporting role, from Paul Sorvino to Robert De Niro, is a miracle.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000C20VPA", "B000C20VRS", "B008R65XYC", "B000M341QE", "B0018CMJSU", "B0019L770A", "B0019L21GA", "B00004XPPB", "B000P0J0AG", "B0000DI87S", "B000P0J0EW", "B00003CXWV", "B00CCMKPO0", "B00G1C2URC", "B00004U103", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004SIP95G", "B002CPMB9O", "B0019L21H4", "B007TBIUSM", "B000286RP2", "B00011CZRE", "B004SIP8ZM", "B0006GAOJA", "B002T9H2LA", "B006TTC5HC", "B002VWNIEA", "0767830555", "B0000AMJEK", "B0000AM6JI", "B00005V9HH", "B004FQX5B6", "B000SFOW8I", "B00008975Z", "B002CA68N4", "6305313687", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00013RC2U", "0792174909", "B007D0FVRM", "B000A7DVR2", "B004G7XCRQ", "B002QEHPQU", "B003ASLJO0", "B000LP6KNU", "B000H5TH20", "B000P0J09C", "6305263248", "0783229526", "B00009W5CA", "B001C0I61M", "B000EHSVRI", "B00IEK9U0E", "B002ZG980U", "B004SIP7TE", "B004SIP7ZS", "B0006GAO5Y", "B00B0U2SFE", "B000ERVKBC", "B000A2UBN4", "B002AF4Y9G", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B0000714BS", "B000E5KQHI", "B00005JA8B", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B003AWRMCE", "B000P0J0EM", "1558908390", "B00080ZG10", "0767802519", "B003ELKNH2", "B003BV8I3Q", "B000035Z5G", "B00AEFXDO6", "B000E8NRBC", "B00000JGHV", "B00004RJ71", "B00AEBB9CS", "B004SIP93S", "B00AEFYSEA", "B004SIP6WW", "B003ASLJQS", "B0001Z4OXS", "B002VWNIDG", "0783225946", "B00AEBB9ZK", "B00AEFXXMI", "B0000A02TZ", "B000MZHW40", "B004SIP6GI", "B002ZG99N6", "B00AEBB95K", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00BB67UNW", "B00029RTAI", "B000P0J0D8", "B003ASLJOU", "B000Z8GZYW", "B003ASLJS6"], "bought_together": ["B000C20VPA", "B000C20VRS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000M341QE", "B0018CMJSU", "B000P0J0EW", "B00BCB1JJW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 120285}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.49, "brand": "WARNER STUDIOS", "asin": "0790729725", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YHNBJW24L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "GoodFellas"}
{"description": "Director William Friedkin was a hot ticket in Hollywood after the success ofThe French Connection, and he turned heads (in more ways than one) when he decided to makeThe Exorcistas his follow-up film. Adapted by William Peter Blatty from hiscontroversial bestseller, this shocking 1973 thriller set an intense and often-copied milestone for screen terror with its unflinching depiction of a young girl (Linda Blair) who is possessed by an evil spirit. Jason Miller and Max von Sydow are perfectly cast as the priests who risk their sanity and their lives to administer the rites of demonic exorcism, and Ellen Burstyn plays Blair's mother, who can only stand by in horror as her daughter's body is wracked by satanic disfiguration. One of the most frightening films ever made,The Exorcistwas mysteriously plagued by troubles during production, and the years have not diminished its capacity to disturb even the most stoical viewers. The film is presented in letterbox format on digital video disc, with a soundtrack that's guaranteed to curdle your blood.

{"description": "The most viscerally frightening and disturbing homicidal-maniac picture sinceThe Silence of the Lambs,Sevenis based on an idea that's both gruesome and ingenious. A serial killer forces each of his victims to die by acting out one of the seven deadly sins. The murder scene is then artfully arranged into a grotesque tableau, a graphic illustration of each mortal vice. From the jittery opening credits to the horrifying (and seemingly inescapable) concluding twist, director David Fincher immerses us in a murky urban twilight where everything seems to be rotting, rusting, or molding; the air is cold and heavy with dread. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are the detectives who skillfully track down the killer--all the while unaware that he has been closing in on them, as well. Gwyneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey are also featured, but it is director Fincher and the ominous, overwhelmingly oppressive atmosphere of doom that he creates that are the real stars of the film. It's a terrific date movie--for vampires.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005V9HH", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000M341QE", "0783240295", "B00003CXZ4", "6305313687", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000P0J0EW", "B000LP6KNU", "B000P0J09M", "B000P0J0AG", "B000069HZP", "B004SIP95G", "B0009A40ES", "B0007PALZ2", "B002NZK5RI", "B002AF4Y9G", "B00AEBB89W", "B004SIP7VM", "B00AEFXQ9S", "B00004BZIY", "B003ASLJO0", "B00003CXWV", "B00096S49Y", "B00AEFYF2K", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00008975Z", "B002T9H2LA", "B00005JLKN", "B000LC55F2", "0767802519", "B004FQX5B6", "B002VWNIEA", "B004SIP7TE", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00AEFXEGS", "0792846435", "B00003CXSP", "B002VWNICC", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000C20VPA", "B00AEFXESQ", "B000P0J0EM", "B000093FLA", "B002ZG99N6", "B002NZK5VO", "B003LR5BD0", "B002VWNIDG", "B000I2J736", "B0001FR3IQ", "B00AEFYYH6", "B000F5GNX8", "B002ZG980U", "B00005JN0W", "B00005JMJG", "B0000AC8LR", "B003ASLJQI", "B000E5N684", "B002XMGGK6", "B003HKN52U", "B00AP2DC94", "B00001ZWUS", "B000A2UBN4", "B000244GCW", "B000A7DVR2", "B002GHHHN8", "B00004WG2F", "B00AEFXKUI", "B001R3YRG2", "B002NZK5UU", "B00004XPPG", "B0034G4P7G", "B000FKO5QK", "B0009MDPYM", "B000NVT0SO", "B003ASLJQS", "B00005JPD0", "B00005JKWX", "B000YAF4MA", "B00005JKIS", "6305065551", "0783229526", "0783233477", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00005JA8B", "B00AEFXYJA", "B0000YEEGM", "B007D5E7C2", "B0002V7ON8", "B000N6U0E2", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00AEBB8LA", "6305718954", "B002AT8K9W", "B00AMSLDTM", "B000FS9FCG"], "bought_together": ["B0007DFJ0G", "6305313687"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004LWZW4M", "B00005V9HH", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000P0J0EW"]}, "price": 13.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 172718}, "asin": "0790729989", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VQ890AJML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Seven (Widescreen)"}
{"description": "Twisterwas a mega-million-dollar blockbuster--helmed by a director (Dutchman Jan de Bont) hot off another scorcher hit (Speed)--that flaunted state-of-the-art digital effects and featured a popular leading actress (Helen Hunt) who would win an Academy Award for her next film (As Good As It Gets). But ask anybody who's seen it and they'll tell you who the real star ofTwisteris: the cow. Not to give anything away, but the cow is one of those inspired little touches (like, say, Bronson Pinchot's career-making cameo inBeverly Hills Cop) that adds a touch of personality to a gigantic Hollywood production. The story is blown out the window after an impressive prologue in which Hunt's character, as a little girl, witnesses her daddy being sucked into a tornado. Basically, Hunt and Bill Paxton are thrill-seeking meteorologists chasing twisters in order to study them (and help warn people of them, of course) with a new technology they've developed. If you thought the Kansas tornado inThe Wizard of Ozwas every bit as scary as the Wicked Witch of the West, then this may be the movie for you.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783225547", "B00E8G5HQE", "B00008G8M4", "B0002V7OI8", "B00000G3PA", "B00005JMXX", "B000P0J0C4", "B0006GANOQ", "B002GIBVVG", "B00AEFXPSK", "6304806434", "B001OFM2TC", "B0045HCJFS", "B0057RCFQS", "0783225733", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000N4RAS8", "B000P0J09W", "6304711891", "B00004Z4WR", "B007STBUHI", "B007SPPANM", "B00E8G5HZ0", "B001OQCV2E", "B0013BM63O", "B00AEFXPMG", "B000QUCRB4", "6305236569", "B000EHSVPK", "B002GHHHKQ", "B000EGDB10", "B00026ZG10", "B000QUU4LY", "B00AEFY4CG", "0800195175", "B001LXIDW2", "0790732149", "1558908315", "B00177YA1K", "B0007PLLBU", "B00003CXFV", "B00081U7HC", "6305212112", "1603800875", "B000JYW5BE", "B0068FZ0O2", "0783235070", "B00003CXTG", "B000FO0AA6", "B000ETRA5U", "B00005JN5E", "B001LXIDVS", "B006VRRGNK", "B0068FZ0GK", "B0013FDM7E", "B00003CXSM", "B00004XPPG", "B000CEV3M8", "6304765266", "B001LXIDVI", "B000QUCQX8", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00393SG1U", "0790730979", "B00AEFXE9U", "B00AEFXXMI", "B000EHSVNW", "0767803434", "B004AOECXI", "B000GRUMPU", "B001ECDVK4", "630471193X", "B00008WFU4", "B005QW98NM", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEBB8NS", "B000SFOW8I", "B00AEFYW64", "B002NZK5V4", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B00008G6E8", "B0045HCJT4", "0783223609", "B00000IQC4", "B00005ATZT", "B00008WFU5", "B00008K76U", "B00AEFY5TI", "B0006FYOTC", "B007IUEE0C", "B00AEFY0F2", "B0002CHK1S", "0783225504", "B001CRC4DG", "B00407PO3W", "B002XUBDRY", "B0000844I8", "0800177258", "B00005JNTI"], "bought_together": ["B00008G8M4", "B00000G3PA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00634MLO0", "B00008G8M4", "B005LAIIPS", "0783225733"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 91188}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790729636", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GW5RZP9SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Twister"}
{"description": "Winner of four Academy Awards, including best picture, director, supporting actor, and best editing, Clint Eastwood's 1992 masterpiece stands as one of the greatest and most thematically compelling Westerns ever made. &quot;The movie summarized everything I feel about the Western,&quot; said Eastwood at the time of the film's release. &quot;The moral is the concern with gunplay.&quot; To illustrate that theme, Eastwood stars as a retired, once-ruthless killer-turned-gentle-widower and hog farmer. He accepts one last bounty-hunter mission--to find the men who brutalized a prostitute--to help support his two motherless children. Joined by his former partner (Morgan Freeman) and a cocky greenhorn (Jaimz Woolvett), he takes on a corrupt sheriff (Oscar winner Gene Hackman) in a showdown that makes the viewer feel the full impact of violence and its corruption of the soul.

{"description": "A gripping true crime yarn, a juicy slice of overheated New York atmosphere, and a splendid showcase for its young actors,Dog Day Afternoonis a minor classic of the 1970s. The opening montage of New York street life (set to Elton John's lazy &quot;Amoreena&quot;) establishes the oppressive mood of a scorching afternoon in the city with such immediacy that you can almost smell the garbage baking in the sun and the water from the hydrants evaporating from the sizzling pavement. Al Pacino plays Sonny, who, along with his rather slow-witted accomplice Sal (John Cazale, familiar as Pacino'sGodfatherbrother Fredo), holds hostages after a botched a bank robbery. Sonny finds himself transformed into a rebel celebrity when his standoff with police (including lead negotiator Charles Durning) is covered live on local television. The movie doesn't appear to be about anything in particular, but it really conveys the feel of wild and unpredictable events unfolding before your eyes, and the whole picture is so convincing and involving that you're glued to the screen. An Oscar winner for original screenplay,Dog Day Afternoonwas also nominated for best picture, actor, supporting actor (Chris Sarandon, as a surprise figure from Sonny's past), editing, and director (Sidney Lumet ofSerpico,Prince of the City,The Verdict, andRunning on Empty).--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["630018627X", "6300216543", "B000003KHS", "6300183211", "630021639X", "0790705141", "6300267881", "6304457375", "0764006770", "0783229585", "6301208773", "B000AMW2TK", "0792845684", "B00000J2KZ", "0792839846", "6301888901", "0790731975", "0783216084", "6301971809", "6303020089", "0800116917", "6303379214", "6301971582", "0792835077", "6300216500", "B00003CXZ3", "B000006ORX", "6304259131", "0792133153", "0783223218", "0790748169", "B00003G1FZ", "6303313345", "6303696813", "B000007PI9"], "bought_together": ["630018627X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 460635}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790733927", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YH9ME7MFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dog Day Afternoon [VHS]"}

{"description": "This feature-length tape began as a three-episode story line on the animated TV series, a superhero crossover where Bruce Wayne visits Metropolis and the Dark Knight meets the Man of Steel for the first time. The two heroes mix like oil and water, the law-and-order Superman suspicious of Batman's rather ruthless methods; but they form an uneasy partnership when Lex Luthor and the Joker team up to take on the duo. To add a personal dimension to the already edgy rivalry, Wayne romances Lois Lane under Clark Kent's very nose. The stylized animation and sharp design of the TV series give the limited animation a sleek, smooth quality and an energetic sense of movement. Timothy Daly supplies the voices for Clark Kent and (in a deeper register) Superman, with Kevin Conroy performing the same vocal trick for Bruce Wayne/Batman; but Dana Delany only has to worry about one persona as Lois Lane.

One of the most conspicuous flops of its decade, the 1997 release must have seemed like a sure thing on paper: a kind of futurist Western starring Costner as a charismatic drifter-turned-hero who leads the resistance against a military tyrant (Will Patton) by reviving the long-dormant postal system to reunite isolated communities in their fight for freedom. The movie bombed, but, like many audacious failures, it's got qualities that make it at least partially endearing, and its earnestness (although bordering on corny) keeps it from being entirely silly.

{"description": "In a time when it seems that every other movie makes some claim to being a film noir,L.A. Confidentialis the real thing--a gritty, sordid tale of sex, scandal, betrayal, and corruption of all sorts (police, political, press--and, of course, very personal) in 1940s Hollywood. The Oscar-winning screenplay is actually based on several titles in James Ellroy's series of chronological thriller novels (including the title volume,The Big Nowhere, andWhite Jazz)--a compelling blend of L.A. history and pulp fiction that has earned it comparisons to the greatest of all Technicolor noir films,Chinatown. Kim Basinger richly deserved her Supporting Actress Oscar for her portrayal of a conflicted femme fatale; unfortunately, her male costars are so uniformly fine that they may have canceled each other out with the Academy voters: Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kevin Spacey, and James Cromwell play LAPD officers of varying stripes. Pearce's character is a particularly intriguing study in Hollywood amorality and ambition, a strait-laced &quot;hero&quot; (and son of a departmental legend) whose career goals outweigh all other moral, ethical, and legal considerations. If he's a good guy, it's only because he sees it as the quickest route to a promotion.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005V9HH", "B00AEFXN9G", "B000K2UVZM", "B0002V7O5Q", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00009W5CA", "B00AEBB9NM", "B00003CXZ4", "B00AEBB9N2", "B000KWZ7JC", "B000HC2LHG", "B00011CZRE", "0446674249", "0767830555", "B0006GANN2", "B00005JKJA", "B004SIP95G", "B00HJRVWM2", "B000055Y0Y", "B00AEFY5B6", "B000P0J0EW", "B005S9ELVC", "0767802519", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005PJ8T", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005ATZT", "B002DU39GW", "B003AWRMCE", "6304698747", "B0006GAOJA", "6305308837", "B003ELKNH2", "B004FQX5B6", "0790732149", "B004U7MR14", "B000LP6KNU", "B000FFJYA2", "B000C20VRS", "B00005AUK9", "B0002XNT12", "B003XURDAY", "B00079Z9VO", "B0002HOERG", "B00008975Z", "B000O77SRC", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B000A2UBN4", "B0000AM6JI", "B00BTYOYG2", "B000M341QE", "B0045HCJ9E", "B003ASLJQ8", "B002VWNIAY", "B004SIP7TE", "079284646X", "B004AOECXI", "B000063US2", "B002NZK5VO", "B00005JLRE", "B0087ZG7OI", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00003CWUX", "B0010YSD8Q", "B00006FMAT", "B000P0J09M", "B000A7DVR2", "6305262268", "B003L20IG0", "B00066FBQG", "B00AEBB95K", "B004SIP7F8", "B000GIW9I2", "6305999872", "0767817710", "B000XR9L50", "B00080ZG10", "B00005BCKF", "B000PAAJZ6", "B002T9H2LA", "B000GFLKF8", "B00LG6YEKE", "B000LC55F2", "6305263248", "B0087ZG7R0", "B000CEXEWA", "6305161879", "B000P0J0D8", "0792833279", "B00008OE4W", "B00004XPPB", "B007UW9W5U", "B0045HCJIK", "B00005JMEW", "B00AEBB9UK", "6305428115", "B004SIP9Z6", "B004SIP7ZS", "B0000DI87S", "B00B0U2SFE"], "bought_together": ["B00005V9HH", "B00009W5CA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00GHJ1YUI", "B00005V9HH", "B007NPYP24", "B00003CWL6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 51121}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.89, "brand": "", "asin": "0790734850", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R182THC0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "L.A.

{"description": "In the fourth and reportedly final film of theLethal Weaponseries, director Richard Donner reunites with Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, who reprise their roles as Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh for one last hurrah in a film that is decidedly better than the third and first chapters. This time the pair are pitted against Jet Li, who plays the leader of a Chinese  organized crime unit. Li, a veteran of hundreds of Hong Kong action films, more than holds his own against the more established team of Gibson, Glover, Renee Russo, and Joe Pesci with his subtle yet strong portrayal of the quietly irrepressible Wah Sing Ku. As always with theLethalseries, the plot is incredibly simple to follow: someone steals something, someone gets killed, and Murtaugh is reluctantly thrown into the mix while Riggs dives into the case with gleeful aplomb. As with the previous movies, we watch for the sheer action and chemistry alone. The action sequences throughout the fourth installment are exquisite, from the opening scene involving a flamethrower, a burning building, and a half-naked Murtaugh strutting like a chicken (don't ask, just watch), to the climactic showdown that pays genuine tribute to Jet Li's masterful martial art skills. As for chemistry, the bond between these characters is so strong by now that you sometimes feel like you're watching a TV series in its sixth season, such is the warm familiarity between the audience and the personalities on the screen. The humor is more fluid than ever, aided immeasurably by the casting of comedian Chris Rock, who like Li does a great job of making his presence known in some memorable verbal tirades that would bring a smile out of the Farrelly brothers. But it's the verbal and emotional jousting between Glover and Gibson that makes this fourth episode especially appealing; both are in peak form with great physical and verbal timing. One can only hope that if this is indeed the last of theLethalfilms, that it won't be the last time we see Glover and Gibson together on screen.--Jeremy Storey", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300271331", "6302596092", "6301572688", "6301017080", "B000U1ZV8K", "6304681496", "6304007523", "6302765536", "B00004XPQ6", "6302091632", "6304932553", "080010367X"], "bought_together": ["6300271331", "6302596092"], "also_viewed": ["6301572688", "6302596092", "6300271331"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 396077}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.18, "brand": "", "asin": "0790738945", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516WCCP833L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lethal Weapon 4"}

Jack Nicholson did it inThe Witches of Eastwick; Robert De Niro did it inAngel Heart(as Louis Cyphre--get it?). InThe Devil's AdvocateAl Pacino takes his turn as the great Satan, and clearly relishes his chance to raise hell. He's a New York lawyer, of course, by the name of John Milton, who recruits a hotshot young Florida attorney (Keanu Reeves) to his firm and seduces him with tempting offers of power, sex, and money. Think of the story as a twist on John Grisham'sThe Firm, with the corporate evil made even more explicit. Reeves is wooden, and therefore doesn't seem to have much of a soul to lose, but he's really just our excuse to meet the devil. Pacino's the main attraction, gleefully showing off his--and the Antichrist's--chops at perpetrating menace and mayhem.

{"description": "This romantic, witty, and ultimately poignant glimpse at two strangers (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy) who share thoughts, affections, and past experiences during one 14-hour tryst in Vienna somehow remains writer/director Richard Linklater's  (Dazed and Confused,Slacker) most overlooked gem. Delpy, a stunning, low-key Parisian, meets the stammering American Hawke, as the two share a Eurorail seat--she's starting school in Paris, he's finishing a vacation. Their mutual attraction leads to an awkward meeting (beautifully played by each performer), and Hawke suggests that Delpy spend his remaining 14 hours in Vienna with him.Typically, this skeleton is as much plot as Linklater provides; as usual, he's more interested in concentrating his talents on observing the casual, playful conversations between his leads. His tight time frame allows the characters to say anything to one another, and topics ranging from politics to past romances to fears of the future flow with subtle finesse. The short time frame is also cruel, however, because beneath this love affair lies the painful reality that the two most likely will never see each other again and will be left only with memories--an idea Linklater drives home with an effective snapshot conclusion.Hardly the trite Gen-X bitch session that many '90s films using this approach become, the film feels more like a Bresson or Rohmer piece, containing sharp perceptions--and flawed humans rather than stereotypes. The protagonists' frank revelations and heated exchanges flow in a stream-of-consciousness style, and its no accident that Linklater set the film in Vienna, where Freud invented and practiced psychotherapy.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002Z0EYU", "B0002YLC24"], "bought_together": ["B0002Z0EYU"]}, "price": 29.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 540185}, "asin": "079073382X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Z7RQ7GT4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Before Sunrise [VHS]"}

James Cagney, in a towering performance, is Cody Jarrett, a transparently psychotic robber with a molten temper, feral cunning, and mercurial charm that are finely calibrated extensions of the doomed gangsters he played a decade before, this time coiled not around a Depression-era impetus of greed or class rivalry, but an Oedipal bond. Cody's beloved, calculating \"Ma\" (Margaret Wycherly) is the compass for his every move, her iron will and long shadow acknowledged not only by Cody but by his gang, his bored, restless wife (Virginia Mayo, radiating sensuality and guile), and the undercover cop (Edmond O'Brien) planted in Jarrett's path.Director Raoul Walsh propels the story from a rolling start, a tautly paced train robbery that goes awry, culminating in the leader's capture. An ambitious henchman (Steve Cochran) plots a behind-bars hit foiled by O'Brien, who's infiltrated the prison to befriend Jarrett, a goal handily accomplished with the rescue. Jarrett's paranoia, murderous anger, and longing for his mother are interwoven with intermittent, incapacitating headaches that underline and amplify his core of inner rage; Cagney makes these seizures harrowing, revealing purely animal pain and terror at once frightening and pathetic.Jarrett's escape, the gang's reunion with fellow escapee O'Brien aboard, trusted by Jarrett but not his partners, and the big score that unravels in a climactic gun battle in an oil refinery are conducted with a gritty economy, and Walsh and his cast evoke a criminal life devoid of glamour, noteworthy for the undercurrents of distrust that keep tempers flaring. The final showdown, and Jarrett's crazed, taunting battle cry in the face of death (\"Top of the world, Ma!\"), achieve a sense of tragic inevitability that deservedly make this a defining moment in Cagney's screen career.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301976932", "6302360978", "0792839846", "6302503515", "0790743159", "6304039522", "6301965965", "6303402070", "6304429274", "6305261296", "0782008348", "630266232X", "6301863186", "6304111363", "0790743353", "6301863194", "6301628616", "B000FP7V2U", "1558807780", "6301748107", "6302238331", "6304359705", "6300215644", "B000BWIZRW", "6302413435", "6301798503", "6301978331", "6302278929", "6301967968", "0783217390", "0783235607", "6301976983", "0790743213", "6301976061", "079074886X", "0783221347", "0792107683", "0790744988", "6301797957", "6303391923", "0800100832", "6301564456", "B00005A1VH", "630321245X", "6300183912", "6302801133", "6301967593", "B00000J2L7", "6301965620", "6302424909", "6302375819", "0792101448", "6301973410", "6304119046", "6301670140", "6302374227", "B0002IXSVI"], "bought_together": ["0792839846"], "also_viewed": ["6301797906", "0790743353", "B003UN2I4K"]}, "price": 9.5, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 493158}, "asin": "0790743531", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RZYVNQB6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "White Heat [VHS]"}

{"description": "In suspense films characters frequently deceive one another. But can thecameratell a lie? This is one of the questions that Hitchcock takes up inStage Fright(1950), and his answer has puzzled, infuriated, and delighted audiences ever since its initial release.Stage Frightis one of only two films Hitchcock made in Great Britain after he moved to America in 1940 (the other isFrenzy, his late masterpiece). It is also his only picture to star Marlene Dietrich, whose character's allegiances are even more ambiguous than usual.Years after makingStage Fright, Hitchcock claimed that because the villains were just as frightened as the heroes, the film did not carry the requisite quota of menace. But it has received a good deal of attention in recent years and is worth a fresh look. The director did admit that he was proud of the movie's most astounding plot twist, though no commercial filmmaker since has been bold enough to let the camera lie so eloquently.--Raphael Shargel", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000FZXC", "0783235623", "0783235674", "6301800974", "6301640667", "0783235704", "0783235682", "6305123616", "6300268594", "6300183580", "0783221347", "6300273202", "6300183513", "6302413435", "6300208133", "630150528X", "0790743213", "0792107683", "6302374227", "B0002IXSVI", "0783235593"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 535493}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.96, "brand": "", "asin": "0790742411", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41J4PY6F93L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Stage Fright [VHS]"}
{"description": "Adapted from a hit Broadway play by Robert Sherwood and starring original cast members Leslie Howard and Humphrey Bogart, this 1936 suspense drama is set in an aging desert roadhouse caf&eacute;, where a young woman (Bette Davis) dreams of escaping a dead-end existence spent with her father and a lunkheaded, would-be suitor. Along comes a penniless poet (Howard), a wanderer who has made a mess of his life and crossed the hot sands as a symbolic act of meaningful futility. Davis's waitress is instantly enchanted, and in short order they begin talking about heading out to the world together. Then a twist: the world comes to them--in the form of escaped convicts, led by the monosyllabic Duke Mantee (Bogart), who secretly agrees to the poet's request that the fugitive gangster kill him. Directed by Archie Mayo (The Great American Broadcast), much of the film, perhaps inevitably, looks set-bound. Most of the action occurs in the caf&eacute;, and the script's tension sadly dissipates a bit as villains and hostages stay glued to their seats. The film's enduring appeal has everything to do with the leading performances: the fascinating alchemy of Howard's ethereal air, Davis's sexy urgency, and Bogart's bemused menace. If the story feels a trifle dated and perhaps a bit smug, the actors make it compelling nonetheless.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301976983", "6301968948", "0790743159", "B000BWIZRW", "6301973291", "6302952581", "6302011027", "6301968891", "6302548438", "079074886X", "630254842X", "6302360978", "6300183890", "6301978110", "6303364772", "B0000068EE", "6301798503", "6301797906", "6304429274", "0792839846", "B00005Q4GZ"], "bought_together": ["6301976983"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 608098}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.59, "brand": "", "asin": "0790747219", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PBHHMJ5YL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Petrified Forest [VHS]"}

{"description": "When it was released during Hollywood's golden year of 1939,The Wizard of Ozdidn't start out as the perennial classic it has since become. The film did respectable business, but it wasn't until its debut on television that this family favorite saw its popularity soar. And whileOz's TV broadcasts are now controlled by media mogul Ted Turner (who owns the rights), the advent of home video has made this lively musical a mainstay in the staple diet of great American films. Young Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland), her dog, Toto, and her three companions on the Yellow Brick Road to Oz--the Tin Man (Jack Haley), the Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr), and the Scarecrow (Ray Bolger)--have become pop-culture icons and central figures in the legacy of fantasy for children. As the Wicked Witch who covets Dorothy's enchanted ruby slippers, Margaret Hamilton has had the singular honor of scaring the wits out of children for more than six decades. The film's still as fresh, frightening, and funny as it was when first released. It may take some liberal detours from the original story by L. Frank Baum, but it's loyal to the Baum legacy while charting its own course as a spectacular film. Shot in glorious Technicolor, befitting its dynamic production design (Munchkinland alone is a psychedelic explosion of color and d&eacute;cor),The Wizard of Ozmay not appeal to every taste as the years go by, but it's required viewing for kids of all ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005F96UJ6", "B0000VCZKM", "B00E9ZATKI", "0792839749", "B0087F7VSY", "B0090XLDKY", "B002M2Z3BA", "076781326X", "B00C7JGDBW", "B000P0J09W", "B000URDCC6", "B002HK9IDQ", "B0000DZ3EN", "B000RPCK2E", "B000065V42", "B001JV5BF8", "B0000AM6IY", "B00335EQ0E", "B005NFJAZS", "B003VS0CX8", "B0000VCZKW", "0062278010", "B002NZK5SW", "B0010X744G", "B00CQRN3QI", "B0009XT8ME", "B000HT3PGU", "B006VJ1AAI", "B00005RRG7", "B008H6GHEM", "B00GVFJ5QS", "B00HVBB140", "B002VWNIAY", "B000BT970O", "B002CLBJPK", "0060293233", "B00028HBES", "B00322XV8Q", "B00EV1YZ96", "B000AJJNIG", "B00AATV0WS", "B0054OGQM8", "1495421864", "0739060821", "B00AEFXMGU", "0792833759", "B00AMSQBNK", "B000TPTCP0", "B0009X75QU", "B00ITVMMOY", "B00005RRGB", "B0017Q0SJ4", "0767836324", "B004302N2Q", "084318017X", "B001GLX6UI", "B003YBW2Y4", "1402766254", "B00019GHU2", "B00003CXCQ", "B00AMSM9CW", "B00005JG6M", "B0047QLNUY", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B00447L4JG", "0767819659", "B00000JPH6", "B002BIGCXS", "B00G5G7EXY", "B0000AK7AB", "B006FE83UE", "B002VWNIBI", "B00005JL1P", "B001ILFUDC", "0800177258", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00005RDSQ", "B00JHH1ZN8", "B0006IINYQ", "B0015NORDW", "B002GHHHNS", "B0013ND30M", "0792838408", "B001AGXEAG", "B0047CG9F2", "B00006ADD5", "B0013FSL3E", "B00079Z9VO", "B00F6SHECS", "B0008JIJ2E", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00005JN4W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HVBB140", "B005F96UJ6", "B0000VCZKM", "B00I6JOD2S"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 206236}, "asin": "0792833171", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GYW80GAJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Wizard of Oz"}
{"description": "MGM's bold idea to remake George Cukor's Oscar-winning upperclass romantic farce,The Philadelphia Story, into a star-studded, Technicolor musical with Cole Porter tunes somehow works splendidly and remains an underrated gem. Even the plot and character names--and some bits of dialogue--all remain the same as the original. Crooning Bing Crosby replaces Cary Grant as the wealthy ex-husband trying to win back his soon-to-be-remarried ex-wife, spoiled ice queen Tracy Lord (Grace Kelly, stunning and aloof in her last film role, originated in the earlier comedy by Katherine Hepburn). Unlike Grant, however, Crosby has jazz great Louis Armstrong, playing himself, in his corner for quixotic persuasion. Frank Sinatra (cocky in James Stewart's former role) and Celeste Holm add support as the nosy reporters covering, and subsequently complicating, the upcoming wedding. Sure,High Societylacks the original's witty satire, sarcasm, and character complexity; but it's assuredly paced and wonderfully acted, and contains enough romantic chemistry to keep the plot engaging. And then there's the music. Unlike the grandiose production numbers of many '40s and '50s musicals,High Society's musical sequences are considerably low-key and intimate, focusing on Porter's lyrical content, and the style in which it's delivered by the charismatic performers. Armstrong kicks the film off in telling style: he sings the title track, a calypso tune outlining the plot like a Greek chorus, not as an elaborately choreographed song-and-dance number, but instead stuffed claustrophobically in the back of a limousine with his jazz band. Other musical standouts include Sinatra and Crosby playfully tossing barbs during \"Well, Did You Evah?\"; Crosby and Armstrong teaming up for an energetic clash of styles in \"Now You Has Jazz\"; the two soaring, archetypal ballads by the leads--Crosby's \"I Love You, Samantha\" and Sinatra's superior \"You're Sensational\"; and, finally, the satirical Sinatra/Holm duet, \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?,\" the closestHigh Societyever comes to social or class commentary.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302363292", "0792840836", "0792840844", "0792837630", "6300215660", "6303494390", "B00004RV8M", "6300183513", "6300215741", "6303444202", "630197736X", "6300183580", "6305282927", "B0000040EO", "0783221347", "630150528X", "155880997X", "0782006809", "6301586026", "B00000F6D1", "B00004TRD5", "630233683X", "0782006779", "6302227127", "0790744759", "0792839846", "6301670140", "6302484391", "6300215695", "6303209890", "0792840860", "6300181529", "B00005LMA7", "6303394019", "B000056BRF", "6301278410", "B000EW1RBA", "0800100832", "6300251152", "6301964012", "0782008348", "630266232X", "1558807780", "0783235593", "6303333079", "630290899X", "B00003OSTO"], "bought_together": ["6302363292", "0792840844"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 285126}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0792837649", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DXMQJX2DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "High Society [VHS]"}

Bertolucci is also operating on subtext here: in a way, Brando's nonengaging engagement is a metaphor for a certain attitude toward directing movies.

{"description": "If you can stifle the urge to laugh at its pastel unisex costumes and futuristic shopping-mall d&eacute;cor, this extravagant science fiction film from 1976 is still visually fascinating and provocatively entertaining. Set in the year 2274, when ecological disaster has driven civilization to the protection of domed cities, the story revolves around a society that holds a ceremonial death ritual for all citizens who reach the age of 30. In a diseaseless city where free sex is encouraged and old age is virtually unknown, Logan (Michael York) is a \"sandman,\" one who enforces this radical method of population control (but he's about to turn 30 and he doesn't want to die). Escaping from the domed city via a network of underground passages, Logan is joined by another \"runner\" named Jessica (Jenny Agutter), while his former sandman partner (Richard Jordan) is determined to terminate Logan's rebellion. Using a variety of splendid matte paintings and miniatures,Logan's Runearned a special Oscar for visual effects (images of a long-abandoned Washington, D.C., are particularly impressive), and in addition to fine performances by Jordan and Peter Ustinov, the film features '70s poster babe Farrah Fawcett in a cheesy supporting role. Jerry Goldsmith's semi-electronic score is still one of the prolific composer's best, andLogan's Runremains an interesting example of '70s sci-fi that precededStar Warsby less than a year.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0045HCJKS", "B0016I0AJG", "B000P0J0BU", "B006MFQ4OS", "B0050MB5N4", "B00008438U", "B004LB5FDG", "B000063UR1", "B001DE29SI", "B0045HCJSA", "B001BGS17Q", "B0045HCJ9O", "0899668968", "B000087F6L", "B000E6ESEO", "B00000IREA", "B0003JAOO0", "0784011338", "B00AEBB8VK", "B004L9GMBC", "B000HEWEDK", "B002945DU2", "B002VA5A02", "B000O78KWE", "B00A44GNTE", "B00005JKFR", "B005FQ2H8W", "B0029ATTAQ", "B004KPLVV8", "B00009NHC0", "0780622650", "B004VT9JMG", "B00007JMD8", "B0045HCJ8A", "0783226063", "B0001I55SS", "B000BZN1NM", "B001BSBBNK", "B007Y1NNAW", "B000BOH8Y6", "B00005JKU0", "B00AEBB94G", "B000096IAC", "B005AMJ36U", "B00AJXO3S8", "B000QXDCJ2", "B003NH3X5Q", "B00BMJ7ZKG", "B008R65XN8", "B00005Y6XR", "B00005JP4N", "B00BJC8OJ2", "B001ECDVKE", "B0018O4YT0", "0767805712", "B000YBKO6U", "B00004XPPE", "B0016B6ZJW", "B000OA8OK4", "6305761078", "B00AEFYCW8", "6305869103", "B000E8QVBU", "0553025171", "B0002MHDW4", "B002I9Z8I0", "B001DW2BG0", "B00D9EJFZA", "0783225903", "B002GHHHKQ", "B00158K0QU", "B00CFHEFSO", "B00LC4PCVU", "B00F3L8P26", "B007JE3JQW", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B0006J28MS", "B00AQSN620", "B00441GYQ0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00EF1PM44", "B0045HCJKS", "B0016I0AJG", "B000E6ESEO"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 255518}, "asin": "0792839692", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511T4XVBY9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Logan's Run"}
{"description": "InThe Bad and the Beautiful, Kirk Douglas plays a tyrannical, manipulative producer fallen on hard times. To get back on his feet, he asks for help from three Hollywood giants whose careers he helped launch--a director (Barry Sullivan), an actress (Lana Turner), and a writer (Dick Powell). Unfortunately, they all hate him. Flashbacks explain why. Douglas had been close to all three at different points in his career: He and the director started out together making B-movies, he gave the wayward actress her first starring role, he turned the novelist into a successful screenwriter.  Then in one way or another he stabbed each of them in the back, though not always deliberately. The script has a lot of backstage  clich&eacute;s, but Vincente Minnelli's sharp, energetic direction, the gorgeous black-and-white  cinematography, and the topnotch performances--particularly Douglas and Gloria Grahame, who won an Oscar for her sweet role as the writer's cheerful Southern wife--flesh out the clich&eacute;s with cutting details and convincing bile. Caustic, starry-eyed, and slyly funny,The Bad and the Beautifulis a strange and skillful blend of \"If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere\" pluck and poisonous cynicism, one of the great movies about making movies.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303391931", "078200847X", "6304628188", "6301491920", "6302000661", "6302227135", "6300183890", "0783215096", "6300183874", "6301968891", "6303364772", "0792839846", "6304508557", "6301969316", "630266232X", "6301564456", "0790743531", "0792845951", "6302375827", "6302278929", "B00000493Q", "0783215517", "630197350X", "0792844564", "6301967410", "079284517X", "6300273202", "6300216012", "6304308418"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 448211}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.93, "brand": "", "asin": "0792840038", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C42P8QFDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Bad and the Beautiful [VHS]"}
{"description": "Five years afterCaptain Bloodmade him a swashbuckling star, Errol Flynn returned to the high seas as privateer Captain Thorpe inThe Sea Hawk. Flynn plays the dashing gentleman pirate as dedicated patriot, looting Spanish ships for English coffers with the private blessing of Queen Elizabeth (Flora Robson, reprising the role fromFire over England). The film opens with a rousing sea battle: broadside cannon fire sends masts falling and splinters a-flying before Flynn's men take their Spanish quarry in a furious shipboard cutlass battle. The fearless fighter becomes a stumbling schoolboy when he falls for the Spanish ambassador's niece, but he's back in his element when he sails to the New World for treasure and lands in the middle of a deadly conspiracy. Big-eyed beauty Brenda Marshall stands in for Flynn's usual love interest Olivia de Havilland, and the film misses the latter's sass and spirit, but it's a minor shortcoming. Claude Rains plays his usual smoothly conniving villain, and hearty Alan Hale returns as Flynn's loyal sidekick. Michael Curtiz proves once again why he was Warner Brothers' top director with a handsome, action-packed film that mixes intrigue and suspense with grand set pieces, concluding with a rousing series of escapes, chases, and a runaway sword fight. Classic Hollywood swashbuckling at its best.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301977165", "6302120527", "6300988473", "B00IF0KAYS", "6301325508", "B000N3T0GO", "6301978331", "B004MGMABA", "B000F100F4", "6304429274", "B0047BXQZY", "6301976924", "6302120101", "B00005A1VG", "B006P0UQ2G", "B000A9QK8M", "6303943004", "630197638X", "B000EO7AIC", "6302353785", "B0000040EO", "B000005XY2", "6304457316", "6303257801", "6301327845", "6301976061", "B000056PNU", "B0000524DN", "0783236352", "6301736362", "6300215512", "6302120454", "6301967593", "6300208281", "6301395875", "B000DZAM5A", "6303072798", "6301449142", "630274721X", "6303599052", "B00004TX24", "6302700949", "6302182530", "6301963636", "079284517X", "6303333079", "6302309751", "6301798759", "0783235682", "B00A1AU66M", "6303037380", "6301663012", "6301628454", "0792107683", "630266232X", "630150528X", "630345786X", "0792838556"], "bought_together": ["6301977165", "6301325508"], "also_viewed": ["B000N3T0GO", "B00407PNWO", "B00005JMR7", "B0047BXQZY", "B006VRRGOO", "6302120527", "B000M2E304", "B004MGMABA", "B003ASLJRC", "6301564464", "B00005JO4D", "B00005PJ8S", "630197638X", "B0007OY2PS", "6301977165", "6300988473", "B002PAP6J8", "B000FBHCTG", "B001EWBY80"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 522757}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.67, "brand": "", "asin": "0792841042", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511M01QVDSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sea Hawk [VHS]"}

{"description": "Pierce Brosnan returns for his second stint as James Bond (afterGoldenEye), and he's doing it in high style with an invigorating cast of costars. It's only appropriate that a Bond film from 1997 would find Agent 007 pitted against a media mogul (Jonathan Pryce) who's going to start a global war (beginning with stolen nuclear missiles aimed at China) to create attention-grabbing headlines for his latest multimedia news channel. It's the information age run amok, and Bond must team up with a lovely and lethal agent from the Chinese External Security Force (played by Honk Kong action star Michelle Yeoh) to foil the madman's plot of global domination. Luckily for Bond, the villain's wife (Teri Hatcher) is one of his former lovers, and at the behest of his superior M (Judi Dench), 007 finds ample opportunity to exploit the connection. Although it bears some nagging similarities to many formulaic action films from the '90s,Tomorrow Never Dies(with a title song performed by Sheryl Crow) boasts enough grand-scale action and sufficiently intelligent plotting to suggest the Bond series has plenty of potential to survive into the next millennium. Armed with the usual array of gadgets (including a remote-controlled BMW), Brosnan settles into his role with acceptable flair, and the dynamic Yeoh provides a perfect balance to the sexism that once threatened to turn Bond into a politically incorrect anachronism.  He's still Bond, to be sure, but he's saving the world with a bit more sophisticated finesse.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304032579", "B00008V2VP", "6305784906", "6304047843", "6302510031", "6302380294", "6302510023", "6302510198", "630251004X", "B000006FNX", "630251018X", "6302510015", "6302380596", "6302510007", "B00AQSN7HE", "B001PPLIEG", "6302380588", "B007REV4T8", "B00004TYS8", "6302824613", "6303651488", "6303651461", "630238060X", "B0000068SI", "B00000JGEI", "6303313345", "B000005QWI"], "bought_together": ["6305784906", "B00008V2VP"], "also_viewed": ["B009NUV0E8", "6304032579", "B001PO6FF4", "B00008V2VP", "B001AQO3TW", "B00AZFECS6", "630251004X", "B007REV4YI", "B001PPLIEG", "6302510007", "B009L6S5EC", "6304047843", "6305784906", "6302510198", "6303651488", "B00AQSN7HE", "630238060X", "B0055OG2BC", "B0030IIZ4M", "630251018X", "6302380294", "6303651461", "B00004TYS8", "6303402348", "B00K7IPGS6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 584838}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.79, "brand": "", "asin": "079283965X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4149PM1DNVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tomorrow Never Dies (Limited Edition Gift Pack) [VHS]"}

{"description": "One of the more upbeat and accessible films by acclaimed Swedish director Ingmar Bergman. Written by Bergman, this autobiographical story follows the lives of two children during one tumultuous year. After the death of the children's beloved father, a local theater owner, their mother marries a strict clergyman. Their new life is cold and ascetic, especially when compared to the unfettered and impassioned life they knew with their father. Most of the story is seen through the eyes of the little boy and is often told in dreamlike sequences. Colorful, insightful, and optimistic, this is far less grim than most of Bergman's work. It was awarded four of the six Oscars for which it was nominated, including Best Foreign Language Film. Though this was announced as his last film, Bergman continued to work into the late 1990s, though mostly for Swedish television.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304209584", "6303107338", "6302641888"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 463606}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.11, "brand": "", "asin": "0792840240", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4162EFCVM8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fanny and Alexander [VHS]"}

{"description": "Horror master John Carpenter offers up a triple treat withThe  Fog: Jamie Lee Curtis, Adrienne Barbeau, and Janet Leigh all in the same  movie. As if that weren't enough, both John Houseman and Hal Holbrook make  appearances, each clearly enjoying the novelty of being in a horror flick.The Fogopens just before the centennial celebration of the seaside  town of Antonio Bay. Then the witching hour strikes, glowing fog rolls in,  and all hell breaks loose. Carpenter wrote the script with producer Debra  Hill, his collaborator onHalloween, and the two know their craft.  It's a creepy story and a tight script, and, as in their previous effort, the  audience gets to know the main characters a bit before they're put in danger.  The movie also has a sly sense of humor: \"Things seem to happen to me,\" says  slasher vet Jamie Lee. \"I'm bad luck.\" Barbeau is also obviously having a  great time, sinking her teeth into her role as a frightened disc jockey  watching the fog roll in from a lighthouse.The Fogoffers a few  shocks and plenty of good old-fashioned clammy chills. You'll never look at  weather systems the same way again.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792846311", "6300181340", "6300247104", "6300182878", "B00023NRSM", "0764006770", "0790705141", "6300147630", "B0009RRUKW", "6304508611", "B0002IXSVI", "0784011923", "6300214311", "0783235607", "6303917283", "6300214672", "6300214192", "0792839234", "6300214087", "6300189015", "0790700506", "6302814731", "6300214605", "6302990130", "B00000JGEN"], "bought_together": ["0790705141"], "also_viewed": ["6300182878", "B001CW7ZWG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 355426}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0792846303", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417H464DWZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Fog [VHS]"}
{"description": "Writer David Mamet created two engrossing and memorable characters, played by Alec Baldwin as the urbane fashion photographer and Anthony Hopkins as a reserved and intellectual billionaire. They find themselves teamed up against a giant Kodiak bear, and their own inner demons, when lost together in the Alaskan wilderness. There is a lot going on in this picture, as the subject matter includes male rivalry, the isolationism of extreme wealth, and, most conspicuously, the survival of the fittest. Mamet's script, which sounds a little too arch in spots, is well served by New Zealand director Lee Tamahori, who knows how to capture beauty and brutality in one frame. Although the themes are enormous in scope, they are well balanced. One rarely overpowers the other, nor does the achingly beautiful scenery overshadow the acting. Even if you do not like the intellectualism of the dialogue, there are some great scenes with the bear.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783216084", "6300182304", "6300182452", "0783222955", "B00003BE3X", "B00003CXFU", "0783223218", "6302945089", "6301888901", "6301208773", "6303020089", "6302787564", "6304258984", "0800132009"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 312341}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.94, "brand": "", "asin": "0793927501", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518EXVXQ1VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Edge [VHS]"}

{"description": "If you think Jim Carrey's comedy is an acquired taste, think ofThe Cable Guyas a potent bottle of bittersweet wine. The film has a lingering aftertaste, but it is just a bit too dark, a bit too extreme to invite another serving. On the other hand, you've got to give Carrey some credit for risking his $20-million paycheck (and a big chunk of box-office revenue) on this black comedy. A needy, psychologically unbalanced cable-television installer (Carrey) forces his friendship upon an unsuspecting bachelor (Matthew Broderick) who has just broken up with his fianc&eacute;e. The movie gets edgier and more desperate--and in some respects funnier--as Carrey's cable guy gradually goes crazy. Director Ben Stiller manages to pack some pointed social commentary into the movie's many humorous detours.  Although it was a box-office disappointment,The Cable Guyis nevertheless a daring comedy for those who have had their fill ofAce Ventura.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CXE4", "0783235070", "B00081912E", "B00AEBB9SM", "B002BIULKS", "B000P0J06A", "B000BKJ762", "0790732157", "B003PIUIHO", "B001SN78JO", "B0000AKCKI", "B00003CWTL", "B000OYC7BW", "B004H83IJQ", "B000E8N8H0", "B008R65XUQ", "B002BIULL2", "B00AEBBA2C", "630529142X", "B00000K3UU", "B00005JL93", "B00AEFXIUK", "B0000CDRVX", "B006TTC5PY", "B00005NGAY", "B00005JM4Q", "B000ELJAEM", "B00AEFXPG2", "B00003CXPS", "B00AEFYZCU", "155890834X", "B0068FZ0O2", "B000HT386M", "B00009PY3X", "B00005JKNC", "B00005KA6V", "B000PHX5P0", "B00003GPFT", "B00005JMYI", "B004A8ZX3C", "B004H83IM8", "B00003CXO1", "B00005OCJP", "B000068TPB", "B00AEBB9K0", "0792842162", "B00AEFYS2M", "B00024JC4E", "B00177YA1K", "B000FP2OPO", "B0009P42WI", "B00005JMJG", "0783227345", "B000CPH9PM", "B000A3XYIM", "B00AEBB9GY", "B008R65XTC", "B000U1ZV4Y", "B0009HBPN0", "B002ZG971U", "6304806434", "6305161860", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000VXWX7E", "6305428263", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00004TJMW", "B000WZEZGI", "B0006GANPA", "6305433925", "B000068MBS", "B00AEFYIQ8", "B00AEFYPXY", "B000I0RNVQ", "B0016MOV92", "B00000K3U4", "0800195175", "B000067FP8", "B001G5T6GW", "B00E1HIX66", "B000MGBSJE", "B00013RC7K", "B00441GYVA", "B002ZG9800", "B0009ZE9VW", "B0000VD11E", "B0009X761E", "B0015XHQT4", "B000K405CY", "B004P7CMZ0", "B0016MJ6J2", "B00001U0BN", "6304711891", "B00003CXS7", "B000MCH5RM", "6305017115", "B00JHH21AE", "B00000JMOD", "B001AEF6C2"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXE4", "0783235070"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CXE4", "0783235070", "0790732157", "B00AEBB9SM"]}, "price": 13.49, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 32844}, "asin": "0800141687", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q8NQFB21L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Cable Guy"}

In addition to being saddled with a devoted-but-nerdy best friend, Matt (Sean Marquette), she falls victim to one of the dangers of playing Seven Minutes in Heaven with the coolest kids in school: being stranded without a willing make-out partner. Humiliated, Jenna buries herself in the aforementioned make-out closet, wishing she could skip the whole adolescence bit and move straight into adulthood, and miraculously wakes up just weeks away from her 30th birthday. Of course, a lot has changed since going to bed the night before, not the least of which being an impressive set of womanly curves. The new, older Jenna (Jennifer Garner) is a successful magazine editor with friends in high places and a lion's share of potential suitors -- including a hockey-playing boyfriend and a swarthy married man. The problem is that her mind hasn't matured with her body; Jenna not only finds living on her own more terrifying than cool, but is quick to dismiss any male over the age of 14 as \"gross.\" Half excited, half mortified, Jenna seeks out Matt (Mark Ruffalo), whom she learns she had spurned as a teenager in an effort to join the popular crowd.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006ZXSL", "B00AKGG6JS", "B00005O5CM", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B0015I2RT8", "B001OQCUYI", "B00005JMCW", "B001OQCUZM", "B00003CXSM", "B000J103OI", "B00AEFYM2S", "B002K0WBXW", "B00AEBB8R4", "B000EMGICS", "B004SIP9X8", "B003LSFM6U", "B0000897EG", "B000ELJAEM", "B00AEFY99O", "1401324142", "6304765266", "1416205152", "B00GO37I8Y", "0809229374", "B0001XAR1I", "B0001Z3TXE", "B00005JM55", "B00AEFYWQY", "B00007E2F5", "B0002VYOVI", "B00KS9V6EC", "B000J4QW7W", "B000YDBPAM", "B0007PLLBU", "B001TUZD8O", "B002ZG988M", "B0009OL7Z4", "B004SIP9RO", "B0000ZMGWK", "1400050138", "B0000DZ6N3", "B00AQS803A", "6302077818", "B00006ZXSK", "B00005JN0Z", "B000YAA68C", "B0007LXPBI", "B00E4Z7FQY", "B002P413IC", "B001ASQ9OM", "B006YTGL86", "B00795C5X4", "B00063KGPU", "B000BVM1S2", "B000209KMW", "B000A343RI", "B00062IVN0", "B000P0J0DS", "B00002SSKI", "6305428425", "B003TY2SWC", "B0051GLDVS", "B00008K7AM", "B0071HPOGK", "B0000AKCJK", "B000023VTP", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00006FMUW", "B002XTXG8O", "B00AMEZDJW", "B001AEF6BS", "B00447L4KA", "B000MQC9H4", "6305428042", "B002GOAH1U", "B0036TGSIK", "B002A5EBMQ", "B0000AOV4I", "B001C5LLQ4", "B000324Y98", "B00005JG6N", "6305236569", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B004EPZ070", "B003L20ICE", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00AEBBA2M", "B00005JN3W", "B0075RREYG", "B000F2BNW2", "0783235070", "B0021L8UO4", "0800177258", "B002SYAGNC", "B000HT386M", "B0007P0Y7C", "B000QUU4LY", "B00006ZXSN", "B00AEBB9WI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0013D8LFY", "B002K0WBXW", "B00AKGG6JS", "B001OQCUZM"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 461629}, "asin": "1404918051", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EO6%2BQ3jvL.jpg", "title": "13 Going on 30: Fun &amp; Flirty Edition"}

{"description": "Considered by many to be the greatest B&nbsp;movie ever made, the original-release version of Orson Welles's film noir masterpieceTouch of Evilwas, ironically, never intended as a B&nbsp;movie at all--it merely suffered that fate after it was taken away from writer-director Welles, then reedited and released in 1958 as the second half of a double feature. Time and critical acclaim would eventually elevate the film to classic status (and Welles's original vision was meticulously followed for the film's 1998 restoration), but for four decades this original version stood as a testament to Welles's directorial genius. From its astonishing, miraculously choreographed opening shot (lasting over three minutes) to Marlene Dietrich's classic final line of dialogue, this sordid tale of murder and police corruption is like a valentine for the cinematic medium, with Welles as its love-struck suitor. As the corpulent cop who may be involved in a border-town murder, Welles faces opposition from a narcotics officer (Charlton Heston) whose wife (Janet Leigh) is abducted and held as the pawn in a struggle between Heston's quest for truth and Welles's control of carefully hidden secrets. The twisting plot is wildly entertaining (even though it's harder to follow in this original version), but even greater pleasure is found in the pulpy dialogue and the sheer exuberance of the dazzling directorial style.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302281849", "B001BZQMFA", "0783236352", "1558807780", "0783221347", "0782008348", "630266232X", "630347327X", "6305012792", "6302655897", "6302413400", "6302413435"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 403157}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.88, "brand": "", "asin": "1558804226", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G3Y343C4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Touch of Evil [VHS]"}
{"description": "The surprising truth about Disney's 1982 computer-game fantasy is that it's still visually impressive (though technologically quaint by later high-definition standards) and a lot of fun. It's about a computer wizard named Flynn (Jeff Bridges) who is digitally broken down into a data stream by a villainous software pirate (David Warner) and reconstituted into the internal, 3-D graphical world of computers. It is there, in the blazingly colorful, geometrically intense landscapes of cyberspace, that Flynn joins forces with Tron (Bruce Boxleitner) to outmaneuver the Master Control program that holds them captive in the equivalent of a gigantic, infinitely challenging computer game. Disney's wizards used a variety of cinematic techniques and early-'80s state-of-the-art computer-generated graphics to accomplish their dynamic visual goals, and the result was a milestone in cyberentertainment, catering to technogeeks while providing a dazzling adventure for hackers and nonhackers alike. Appearing just in time to celebrate the nascent cyberpunk movement in science fiction,Tronreceived a decidedly mixed reaction when originally released, but has since become a high-tech favorite and a landmark in special effects, with a loyal following of fans. DVD is a perfect format for the movie's neon-glow color scheme, and the musical score by synthesizer pioneer Wendy Carlos is faithfully preserved on the digitally remastered soundtrack.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002ZG99QS", "B0001I55SS", "B004K4IZ3G", "B008R65XN8", "B0024FADAQ", "B0015NORDW", "B0037KMHRY", "B003TEI3E4", "B0013LL2Z2", "B0030MOTNE", "B008JFUS0U", "B008JFUO72", "B006ZOFX7K", "6305047456", "142313463X", "B0045HCJ9O", "B0039MIPDA", "0783226063", "B002GHHHOM", "B00008OE4W", "B0090SI56Y", "B0001I562I", "B000056WR3", "B0045HCJKS", "B0042YXWUK", "B004VT9JLM", "B003RACGZM", "B000P0J06K", "B005LAIH2W", "B002HWRYJE", "B002SR6CIM", "B0038OMQPW", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B0038ZITIE", "B006VRRGNK", "B00K7IPFSM", "B0001Z37HM", "B004M20YDU", "B004J1P5RE", "B00AEFXT7W", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000VECAD0", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00005PJ6N", "B0030MOXA8", "B00E5I2M9K", "B0002J58GU", "B001PPLIEG", "B001O4KBPA", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000QXDCJ2", "B0038OMQNY", "B00005PJ6M", "B004LWZW42", "6305428514", "B00005JKFR", "B008JFUO36", "B00005JKU0", "B008JFUQZ2", "630469654X", "B00005JKEX", "B005LAII3A", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00005AB62", "B000HEVZ9E", "B001AGXEAG", "B00JPS7HOA", "B001FB55HQ", "B004L9GMBC", "B002GHHHKQ", "B001MWUWU8", "B00006JC48", "B005COPWZW", "B000SUKPL6", "B00000JPH6", "B004LWZWFQ"], "bought_together": ["B002ZG99QS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002ZG99QS", "B004OBQQRW", "B0044XV3R8", "B00I6JOD2S"]}, "price": 14.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 226749}, "asin": "1558908358", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GQ2WSNH5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tron"}
{"description": "The Best of Chris Farleyblasts through 68 minutes of the wildly hilarious characters the comic actor created while withSaturday Night Livein the early 1990s. Farley was a comedic gem--not only because he created such bizarre, repulsively funny characters, such as Matt Foley, Motivational Speaker, or Lori Davis, cosmetics infomercial queen, but because he lived completely inside the character, delivering lines with whatever fury, stupidity, hypertension, insecurity, or femininity the situation demanded. Clearly, Farley loved making people laugh and he wasn't afraid to use his big bulk to do it, whether it entailed stripping as a Chippendale's dancer, belly flopping on coffee tables, rolling around on a couch as Tom Arnold, or punching his forehead in dismay on the \"Chris Farley Show.\" What's great about this collection is all of those characters appear; what's disappointing is that some don't linger long enough, while others appear a bit too long. The cafeteria-lady number could've been cut short in lieu of a longer Tom Arnold segment, or Herlihy Boy could've been removed altogether in favor of complete \"Chris Farley Show\" segments. Still, if you forgot how side-splitting Farley's portrayal of Dom DeLuise or the French-fry-stuffing Gap girl was, this video will happily jog your memory.--Karen Karleski", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002I84FI", "B004CJB0CC"], "bought_together": ["B0002I84FI"], "also_viewed": ["B0000C2IQW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 483702}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 4.98, "brand": "", "asin": "1573626163", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RHZWZA8YL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Saturday Night Live - The Best of Chris Farley [VHS]"}

{"description": "The best-sellingnovelby Michael Crichton was faithfully adapted for this taut 1971 thriller, about a team of scientists racing against time to destroy a deadly alien virus that threatens to wipe out life on Earth. As usual with any Crichton-based movie, the emphasis is on an exciting clash between nature and science, beginning when virologists discover the outer-space virus in a tiny town full of corpses. Projecting total contamination, the scientists isolate the deadly strain in a massive, high-tech underground lab facility, which is rigged for nuclear destruction if the virus is not successfully controlled. The movie spends a great deal of time covering the scientific procedures of the high-pressure investigation, and the rising tensions between scientists who have been forced to work in claustrophobic conditions. It's all very fascinating if you're interested in scientific method and technological advances, although the film is obviously dated in many of its details. It's more effective as a thriller in which tension is derived not only from the deadly threat of the virus, but from the escalating fear and anxiety among the small group of people who've been assigned to save the human race. The basic premise is still captivating; it's easy to see how this became the foundation of Crichton's science-thriller empire.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302909023", "6300183580", "6301562178", "6303212263", "6300213838", "6301977815", "0792835077", "6302098424", "630442972X", "6300271781", "6301971426", "6301968948", "6301744160", "6300183513", "6300181340", "6303257828", "6302182522", "0792845684"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 63562}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 25.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6300181537", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51M29A10DWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Andromeda Strain [VHS]"}

{"description": "Clint Eastwood (making his very assured directorial debut) is a poetry-spouting stud-muffin DJ stalked by a maniacally amorous fan after a misguided one-night stand in this enjoyably schlocky, undeniably effective film about good intentions gone murderously wacky. Although many of thevery'70s trappings presented here may ultimately be too dated to be taken seriously (including a very self-indulgent jazz number and a hilariously gooey seduction number between Eastwood and Donna Mills), the core premise of infatuation taken out of bounds remains uncomfortably plausible--and was influential enough to be appropriated by one of the biggest hits of the '80s. (Here's a hint--it starred Michael Douglas, Glenn Close, and a very unfortunate bunny rabbit). A well-staged and occasionally very frightening thriller worth watching for Jessica Walter's peerlessly unhinged performance alone. Frequent Eastwood collaborator Don Siegel (director ofDirty Harry,Coogan's Bluff, andThe Beguiled, to name but a few) has a nice cameo as Murphy, the mustachioed, chess-playing bartender.--Andrew Wright", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304429711", "6300215644", "B000005PJ6", "6300247236", "0790751216", "B003ASLJO0", "6300182452", "6304259131", "B00407PNY2", "B0002IXSVI", "079284517X", "6301773586", "1558807780", "6300215741", "079212569X", "6304457391", "6300215962", "6300215717", "6302224306", "6301863194", "6303589073", "0790748169", "0784001294", "6302935148", "6301607929", "B00005A1VH", "6301797957", "6304457383", "630443796X", "6300215601", "630248443X", "6300216543", "0790731975", "6300182495", "6305076146", "6300216721", "6300268063", "6302841984", "6300181707", "6300215873", "6303082815", "B000006FNX", "079073172X", "6304119046", "6300182533", "6303020089"], "also_viewed": ["B001M9ELQ2", "B000005PJ6"]}, "price": 10.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 276056}, "asin": "6300181405", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ABNPHZEHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Play Misty for Me [VHS]"}
{"description": "Even a man who is pure in heart,And says his prayers by night,May become a wolf when the wolfbane bloomsAnd the autumn moon is bright.If you haven't heard this piece of horror-movie doggerel before, you'll never forget it after seeingThe Wolf Manfor two reasons: it's a spooky piece of rhyme and nearly everybody in the picture recites it at one time or another. Set in a fog-bound studio-built Wales,The Wolf Mantells the doom-laden tale of Lawrence Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.), who returns to the estate of his wealthy father (Claude Rains). (Yes, Chaney's American, but the movie explains this, awkwardly.) Bitten by a werewolf, Talbot suffers the classic fate of the victims of lycanthropy: at the full moon, he turns into a werewolf, a transformation ingeniously devised by makeup maestro Jack Pierce. Pierce was the man who turned Boris Karloff into the Frankenstein monster, and his werewolf makeup became equally famous, with its canine snout and bushy hairdo--and, of course, seriously sharp dental work.The Wolf Manwas a smash hit, giving Universal Pictures a new monster for their already crowded stable, and Chaney found himself following in the footsteps (or paw prints) of his father, who had essayed a monster or two in the silent era. This is a classy horror outing, with strong atmosphere and a thoughtful script by Curt Siodmak--well, except for the stiff romantic bits between Chaney and Evelyn Ankers. It's also got Bela Lugosi (briefly) and Maria Ouspenskaya, the prunelike Russian actress who foretells doom like nobody's business.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300183084", "6302120101", "6300181278", "6300181286", "6300183629", "6300185281", "6300185443", "630252542X", "6302843219", "6300181820", "6302526167", "6301257014", "630018529X", "6302841763", "6301005783", "6302526175", "630284178X", "6303626424", "6301967410", "6302841771", "6302884713", "6302843227", "0790736055", "6302841798", "6302841844", "6302814707", "6302526140", "6302182530", "6302526191", "6302526094", "6302194296", "630281474X", "6300247589", "6304507348", "6300208508", "630210176X", "6302526183", "B000HDNPM0", "6303128645", "6300182983", "630214227X", "6302101743", "0790736071", "6303158579", "B00005A1VH", "0783235593", "B00000J2KZ", "1564427099", "630197350X"], "bought_together": ["6300183084", "6302120101"], "also_viewed": ["6300181278", "6302120101", "6300181286", "6300183084", "630018529X", "6300185281", "6300183629", "6302843219", "630252542X", "B00000K14A", "6302843197", "6300185443", "6302526086", "6302526175", "6300181820", "6302841771", "6302841763", "6303129013", "6303129161", "B008FL8OTK", "6302841879", "6302843200", "630312917X", "630252587X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 211621}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.29, "brand": "", "asin": "6300183092", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VRRBHJATL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wolf Man [VHS]"}
{"description": "Nothing interests filmmaker Robert Altman more than a contained culture that mixes bare humanity with local eccentricity (think of hisM*A*S*HandNashville). So Altman'sPopeye(1980), based on the old comic strip, works best as a portrait of a busy, cluttered, cartoonish town called Sweethaven. But it is much less successful as a comprehensible story about the famous sailor with massive forearms and a relationship with Olive Oyl (Shelley Duvall). Robin Williams plays Popeye with his usual brilliance for mimicry, Paul Dooley makes a credible Wimpy, and Paul L. Smith makes an impression as the oversized bully, Bluto.

{"description": "As bad asFriday the 13th, Part 2is, it's a work of art in comparison to the rest of theFriday the 13thflicks that came afterward. This installment officially introduced us to Jason Voorhees as the killer (if you remember Drew Barrymore's fatal phone quiz inScream, you know that the killer in the firstFriday the 13thwas actually Jason's mother), and made the slicing and dicing even more generic. Survivor Alice is dispatched within the first 10 minutes, and we're left with plucky Ginny (Amy Steel, doing a fairly decent Jamie Lee Curtis impression) to do battle with the monstrous Jason. Ginny's part of a another group of horny teenagers (less intelligent as well as less attractive than their predecessors) who try to resurrect Camp Crystal Lake five years after the initial murders--a pretty mean feat, considering this movie was made only a year after the first one. Being a smarty-pants child-psychology major, Ginny tries to outwit the dim Jason, and at one point dons the bloody and moldy sweater of Jason's late mother (which is more disgusting than any of the killings beforehand) in an attempt to confuse the masked killer. Jason may not be the brightest bulb on the tree, but the only one who's going to pull the wool--or in this case, the burlap--over his eyes is Jason himself, who wears a sack with one eyehole throughout the movie to hide his deformed features (he finally found his way to a sporting-goods store and his trademark hockey mask appears in the third installment of the series).

{"description": "You didn't think Mr. Spock wasreallydead, did you? When Spock's casket landed on the surface of the Genesis planet at the end ofStar Trek II, we had already been told that Genesis had the power to bring \"life from lifelessness.\" So it's no surprise that this energetic but somewhat hokey sequel gives Spock a new lease on life, beginning with his rebirth and rapid growth as the Genesis planet literally shakes itself apart in a series of tumultuous geological spasms. As Kirk is getting to know his estranged son (Merritt Butrick), he must also do battle with the fiendish Klingon Kruge (Christopher Lloyd), who is determined to seize the power of Genesis from the Federation. Meanwhile, the regenerated Spock returns to his home planet, andStar Trek IIIgains considerable interest by exploring the ceremonial (and, of course, highly logical) traditions of Vulcan society. The movie's a minor disappointment compared toStar Trek II, but it's a--well, logical--sequel that successfully restores Spock (and first-time film director Leonard Nimoy) to the phenomenalTrekfranchise...as if he were ever really gone. With Kirk's willful destruction of the U.S.S.Enterpriseand Robin Curtis replacing the departing Kirstie Alley as Vulcan Lt.

{"description": "The quintessential movie spoof that spawned an entire genre of parody films, the originalAirplane!still holds up as one of the brightest comedic gems of the '80s, not to mention of cinema itself (it ranked in the top 5 ofEntertainment Weekly's list of the 100 funniest movies ever made). The humor may be low and obvious at times, but the jokes keep coming at a rapid-fire clip and its targets--primarily the lesser lights of '70s cinema, from disco films to star-studded disaster epics--are more than worthy for send-up. If you've seen even one of the overblownAirportmovies then you know the plot: the crew of a filled-to-capacity jetliner is wiped out and it's up to a plucky stewardess and a shell-shocked fighter pilot to land the plane. Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty are the heroes who have a history that includes a meet-cute &agrave; laSaturday Night Fever, a surf scene right out ofFrom Here to Eternity, a Peace Corps trip to Africa to teach the natives the benefits of Tupperware and basketball, a war-ravaged recovery room with a G.I. who thinks he's Ethel Merman (a hilarious cameo)--and those are just the flashbacks! The jokes gleefully skirt the boundaries of bad taste (pilot Peter Graves to a juvenile cockpit visitor: \"Joey, have you ever seen a grown man naked?\"), with the high (low?) point being Hagerty's intimate involvement with the blow-up automatic pilot doll, but they'll have you rolling on the floor. The film launched the careers of collaborators Jim Abrahams (Big Business), David Zucker (Ruthless People), and Jerry Zucker (Ghost), as well as revitalized such B-movie actors as Lloyd Bridges, Peter Graves, Robert Stack, and Leslie Nielsen, who built a second career on films like this.

{"description": "Back when the  firstStar Trekfeature was released in December 1979, theTrekfranchise was still relatively modest, consisting of the original TV series, an animated cartoon series from 1973-74, and a burgeoning fan network around the world. Series creator Gene Roddenberry had conceived a second TV series, but after the success ofStar Warsthe project was upgraded into this lavish feature film, which reunited the original series cast aboard a beautifully redesigned starship U.S.S.Enterprise. Under the direction of Robert Wise (best known forWest Side Story), the film proved to be a mixed blessing forTrekfans, who heatedly debated its merits; but it was, of course, a phenomenal hit. Capt. Kirk (William Shatner) leads his crew into the vast structures surrounding V'Ger, an all-powerful being that is cutting a destructive course through Starfleet space. With his new First Officer (Stephen Collins), the bald and beautiful Lieutenant Ilia (played by the late Persis Khambatta) and his returning veteran crew, Kirk must decipher the secret of V'Ger's true purpose and restore the safety of the galaxy. The story is rather overblown and derivative of plots from the original series, and avid Trekkies greeted the film's bland costumes with derisive laughter. But as a feast for the eyes, this is an adventure worthy of big-screen trekkin'. Douglas Trumbull's visual effects are astonishing, and Jerry Goldmith's score is regarded as one of the prolific composer's very best (with its main theme later used forStar Trek: The Next Generation). And, fortunately forStar Trekfans, the expanded 143-minute version (originally shown for the film's network TV premiere) is generally considered an improvement over the original theatrical release.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300214400", "6300213803", "6301543408", "6303202004", "630021463X", "6303909949", "B0000AUHOH", "B00008OSD3", "6301792734", "6305587159", "6300182304", "B0000A36J1", "B000065U6Q", "6304415346", "6305365121", "630336568X", "0671830880", "6300214060", "6304935811", "6302380588", "6303651488"], "bought_together": ["6300213803", "6300214400"], "also_viewed": ["6300213803", "6301543408", "B00DB97LRC", "6300214400", "630021463X", "B00BAXTYIA", "B00005JLRT", "6303202004", "B00DB97LCM", "B00000ILBK", "B002I9Z8DK", "B0000AUHOH", "B002I9Z8B2", "6304415346", "6304539258", "B000USUA8Y", "B002I9Z8CG", "B0095XPZBC", "B002I9Z8GW", "B001TH16DI", "B0083TUEHY", "B00HETWFVC", "630273486X", "B000HEWEJ4", "6303909949", "6300213668"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 278050}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.79, "brand": "", "asin": "6300216802", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4164CYFHC6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek - The Motion Picture [VHS]"}

Nevertheless, it is entirely winning, with Shirley MacLaine and Debra Winger playing a combative mother and daughter who see each other through various ups and downs in love and loss, and most especially through a terminal illness endured by Winger's character. Jack Nicholson deservedly won an Oscar for his supporting role as a free-spirited astronaut who backs away from a romance with MacLaine and then returns in the clutch.

{"description": "AfterThe Exorcistsparked a lengthy trend of supernatural thrillers, this 1976 horror film scored a hit with critics and audiences for mixing gothic horror and mystery into its plot about a young boy suspected of being the personification of the anti-Christ. (No doubt it's a favorite of shock-rocker  Marilyn Manson.) Directed by Richard Donner (best known for hisSupermanandLethal Weaponfilms),The Omengained a lot of credibility from the casting of Gregory Peck and Lee Remick as a distinguished American couple living in England, whose young son Damien bears \"the mark of the beast.\" Mysterious deaths and unexplained incidents draw the attention of a photographer (David Warner), whose investigation leads to the young boy--and also to the photographer's shocking decapitation (in a scene that has since been inducted into the horror hall of fame). At a time when graphic gore had yet to dominate the horror genre, this film used its violence discreetly and to great effect, and the mood of dread and potential death is masterfully maintained. It's all a bit hokey, with a lot of biblical portent and sensational fury, but few would deny it's highly entertaining.  Jerry Goldsmith's Oscar-winning score works wonders to enhance the movie's creepy atmosphere.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300247147", "6300267881", "B00004TS0H", "6304508611", "0792846303", "6300247333", "B00096S48U", "0792836634", "B00005B238"], "bought_together": ["6300247147"], "also_viewed": ["6300247147", "B000AMW2TK", "6300247333"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 237731}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.9, "brand": "", "asin": "6300247104", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41QZ2BFBRFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Omen [VHS]"}
{"description": "Bruce Lee kicked around Hollywood for years looking in vain for an American break when Hong Kong came calling. As Kato in the TV series The Green Hornet he had become an Asian star (the series was renamed for his character when it crossed the Pacific) and ripe for his own vehicle. This raw, low-budget effort, called The Big Boss in its native Hong Kong, is a generic revenge drama enlivened by Lee's intense screen presence and martial arts prowess. He's a country boy who takes a job at a Thailand ice-packing plant and discovers it's a cover for heroin smuggling. Lee is held back through the first half of the film by a promise he made his sweet, gray-haired mom not to brawl (which means you have to wait to see him in action), but his indignation turns to fury as friends and coworkers disappear and the boss sends thugs to take care of the brooding, intense country boy. The final half of the film is a series of violent confrontations, culminating in a marvelously choreographed showdown at the ice plant. Lean, mean Lee, with a physique that looked sculpted in bronze, became an overnight sensation with this film, breaking all Asian box-office records and starting an international kung fu craze, but none of the pretenders ever touched Lee's cool cinematic charisma or his martial arts grace. Lee returned the next year in The Chinese Connection. --Sean Axmaker", "related": {"bought_together": ["6300250164"], "also_viewed": ["B00005OSN6", "B0015RCUQO", "B00005B1X4", "6300250164"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 574610}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.7, "brand": "", "asin": "6300250156", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BYRDFFDSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fists of Fury [VHS]"}

{"description": "Director Francis Coppola's adaptation of the popular S.E. Hinton novel about the price of rebellious youth is notable chiefly for the stunning cast of young actors who went on to rich and varied careers. In supporting roles, the film features the likes of Tom Cruise, Patrick Swayze, Diane Lane, Rob Lowe, Emilio Estevez, and Tom Waits, among others. The story centers on two rival gangs in the early 1960s Midwest, and the violent turf wars that escalate and tragically claim young lives. C. Thomas Howell plays the central character who yearns to prove himself and be accepted by his older brothers' gang, while at the same time finding his first love and dreaming of a life beyond his dead end existence.

But there's much to enjoy here as Merlin shows Newt, the young Arthur, things that will help him become the ruler of the Britons. The transformation sequences, where the boy is turned into a fish, a bird, and a squirrel are vintage Disney. The oft-repeated scene of Merlin battling it out with the mean old Madame Mim still is worth a few chuckles, but it belies the problem with most of the film--the scenes are only there for the chuckles.

{"description": "Imaginatively rendered but slightly chilly, this 1951 Disney adaptation of the Lewis Carroll classic is also appropriately surreal. Alice (voiced by Kathryn Beaumont) has all the anticipated experiences: shrinking and growing, meeting the White Rabbit, having tea with the Mad Hatter, etc. Characterization is very strong, and the Disney team worked hard to bring screen personality to Carroll's eccentric creations. For a Disney film, however, it seems more the self-satisfied sum of its inventiveness than a truly engaging experience.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304401132", "155890641X", "0788812408", "0788802194", "0788812807", "6302526574", "078881172X", "6302642248", "0788806270", "6302178924", "6303314015", "6302320402", "6304500831", "6300274195", "6300275310", "6303983812", "6302961572", "6305229449", "B000035Z2S", "6304400551", "0788805843", "6305319138", "6304290888", "6302787068", "0788803743", "6304089767", "6303929338", "6304100507", "B00005JKDQ", "B0000AQZYM", "6302158095", "6305326940", "6304978286", "6300274608", "B00000ICHA", "6304400225", "6305940932", "B00004R99N", "6301390725", "6302426200", "B00003CXQX", "B00005T7H6", "6301991311", "B00003CXHR", "B00003CX7L", "6303122647", "0788805533", "0788812440", "B00005RDVV", "1558906150", "6304089201", "6303036813", "B00000JS61", "6303534422", "6304501153", "6304155972", "B00005JKX3", "B0000524CZ", "0788811002", "B00016JF2W", "B0000E32WB", "1558901892", "B00000J2JA", "6304400381", "B00005JL95", "6304873441", "0788810634", "B0009SUS4Q", "6302484359", "078880720X", "6300276554", "B0002YLCHE", "0788810448", "B00007AJLB", "B00004R996", "B000063V8N", "0788812181", "B00008Y47S", "6304492952", "B00000ICHI", "6303295614", "6304089627", "B00004R99I", "6304492960", "6303439357", "B000035Z46", "B0001I55VK", "6302313937", "6303939015", "B00029LO18", "B00004REYY", "B00003CXXI", "0788809806", "B00005K9OA", "B00008DP4A", "6305942285", "6301106539", "6304401736", "6305177473"], "bought_together": ["6304401132", "0788812408"], "also_viewed": ["0788802194", "0788812408", "6303314015", "6304401132", "6302642248", "6302526574", "6304500831", "0788806270", "155890641X", "6302787068", "6302320402", "6302178924", "6304400551", "078881172X", "6300274195", "B000035Z2S", "6303983812", "6304290888", "6300275310", "0788805843", "0788812807", "6305319138", "6303534422", "B0000AQZYM", "6302961572", "6305229449", "6303929338", "6304089767", "6305940932", "6304978286", "6304100507", "0788805533", "B00005JKDQ", "6302426200", "6305326940", "B00004R99N", "B00003CXHR", "6300274608", "6304400225", "B00005RDVV", "B00003CX7L", "6304089201", "B0007KTBIU", "6302158095", "6301991311", "B00005JL95", "B00003CXQX", "6304501153", "0788812440", "B00004R99I", "B00000ICHA", "6304400381", "1558906150", "0788811002", "6304117752", "6301390725", "B00003CXXI", "B00000JS61"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 113227}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.43, "brand": "Disney", "asin": "6300274268", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51yPdnVWYXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Alice in Wonderland (Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection) [VHS]"}

Certainly it's not for lack of effort on the part of its stars. Martin is an uptight businessman trying to get home from New York for the holidays. But one thing after another gets in his way--most of it having to do with Candy, a boorish but well-meaning boob who takes a liking to him. Together they travel all over the map; no matter how hard Martin tries to shake him, he can't.

{"description": "Rebeccais an ageless, timeless adult movie about a woman who marries a widower but fears she lives in the shadow of her predecessor. This was Hitchcock's first American feature, and it garnered the Best Picture statue at the 1941 Academy Awards. In today's films, most twists and surprises are ridiculous or just gratuitous, so it's sobering to look back on this film where every revelation not only shocks, but makes organic sense with the story line. Laurence Olivier is dashing and weak, fierce and cowed. Joan Fontaine is strong yet submissive, defiant yet accommodating. There isn't a false moment or misstep, but the film must have killed the employment outlook of any women named Danvers for about 20 years.

The movie itself is similarly irresistible, a colorful soap opera about the passions of a pair of dewy-eyed teens and their straying parents. At an island resort in Maine, Sandra Dee and Troy Donahue (the reigning teen idols of the day) fall hard for each other. What they don't know is that her father (Richard Egan) and his mother (Dorothy McGuire), lovers 20 years earlier, have rekindled their affair. Both, inconveniently, have spouses, which is what makes this a soap opera. Lovers of camp will find much to savor in the incredible '50s attitudes, and in the innocence of supervirgin Dee (\"Johnny, have you been bad with girls?\").

Connery stars as Zed, one of a carefully bred race of supervisors, the Exterminators, who oversee the agricultural labor of the neanderthal Brutals, since in 2293, with most of the Earth's surface off-limits as a polluted Outlands, industrial society has been abandoned. All worship Zardoz, a huge flying stone head who makes periodic visits to Earth to pick up grain consignments and issue bizarre statements involving the male anatomy through the voice of Arthur Frayn (Niall Buggy). An increasingly skeptical Zed decides to stow away inside the head, which deposits him in the Vortex, a commune of scientists and intellectuals who are ruled by the ever-youthful and asexual Eternals. They capture Zed, allowing geneticist May (Sara Kestleman) to use him as a research subject for a limited period, but he begins to arouse more than scientific curiosity in the commune's supposedly nonsexual female population.", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301801709"], "also_viewed": ["B00127IE0S"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 357031}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.11, "brand": "", "asin": "6301744128", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51M1VYRMB8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Zardoz [VHS]"}

{"description": "No director could ever have hoped to repeat the artistic achievement of Stanley Kubrick's2001: A Space Odyssey, and nobody knew that better than Peter Hyams, who made this much more conventional film from the first of three sequel novels by Arthur C. Clarke. Whereas Kubrick made a poetic film of mind-expanding ideas and metaphysical mysteries, Hyams shouldn't be blamed for taking a more practical, crowd-pleasing approach. In revealing much of what Kubrick deliberately left unexplained,2010lacks the enigmatic awe of its predecessor, but it's still a riveting tale of space exploration and extraterrestrial contact, beginning when a joint American-Soviet mission embarks to determine the cause of failure of the derelict spaceshipDiscovery.  Having arrived atDiscoverynear the planet Jupiter, the American mission leader (Roy Scheider) and his Russian counterpart (Helen Mirren) must investigate the apparent failure of the ship's infamous onboard computer, HAL 9000, as well as the meaning of countless mysterious black monoliths amassing on Jupiter's surface (an interpretation Kubrick originally left up to his viewers). Meanwhile, Earth is on the brink of nuclear war, and an apparition of astronaut David Bowman (Keir Dullea) appears to repeatedly promise that \"something wonderful\" is about to happen.--Jeff Shannon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 492181}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6301963660", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/410PMMK1VFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "2010: The Year We Make Contact [VHS]"}

{"description": "In the entire history of American movies,The Night of the Hunterstands out as the rarest and most exotic of specimens. It is, to say the least, a masterpiece--and not just because it was the only movie directed by flamboyant actor Charles Laughton or the only produced solo screenplay by the legendary critic James Agee (who also cowroteThe African Queen). The truth is, nobody has ever made anything approaching its phantasmagoric, overheated style in which German expressionism, religious hysteria, fairy-tale fantasy (of the Grimm-est variety), and stalker movie are brought together in a furious boil. Like a nightmarish premonition of stalker movies to come,Night of the Huntertells the suspenseful tale of a demented preacher (Robert Mitchum, in a performance that prefigures his memorable villain inCape Fear), who torments a boy and his little sister--even marries their mixed-up mother (Shelley Winters)--because he's certain the kids know where their late bank-robber father hid a stash of stolen money. So dramatic, primal, and unforgettable are its images--the preacher's shadow looming over the children in their bedroom, the magical boat ride down a river whose banks teem with fantastic wildlife, those tattoos of LOVE and HATE on the unholy man's knuckles, the golden locks of a drowned woman waving in the current along with the indigenous plant life in her watery grave--that they're still haunting audiences (and filmmakers) today.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["1558808590", "6301976126", "0784011451", "0792101448", "6304212151", "1558807780", "B000003NDA", "6301966430", "6301491920", "B00000F6MH", "6304366035", "6302226899", "0790743159", "6302413435", "6301586026", "0790741431", "6300208133", "6304429274", "0783217528", "6301797906", "6301798732", "0800100832", "B000GX7MMA", "B000054OW2", "6301977815", "B000056BRF", "B0000048YO", "B001E419N8", "630266232X", "6301978110", "6302968100", "6305237115", "6301564456", "0782008348", "0792115449", "6302353785", "6301964012", "630150528X"], "bought_together": ["1558808590"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 201324}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6301973232", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/717SP3TYNML._SY300_.gif", "title": "Night of the Hunter [VHS]"}

{"description": "William Friedkin's classicpolicierwas propelled to box-office glory, and a fistful of Oscars, in 1972 by its pedal-to-the-metal filmmaking and fashionably cynical attitude toward law enforcement. Gene Hackman's Popeye Doyle, a brutally pushy New York City narcotics detective, is a dauntless crime fighter and Vietnam-era \"pig,\" a reckless vulgarian whose antics get innocent people killed. Loosely based upon an actual investigation that led to what was then the biggest heroin seizure in U.S. history, the picture traces the efforts of Doyle and his partner (Roy Scheider) to close the pipeline pumping Middle Eastern smack into the States through the French port of Marseilles. (The actual French Connection cops, Eddie Egan and Sonny Grosso, make cameo appearances.) It was widely recognized at the time that Friedkin had lifted a lot of his high-strung technique from the Costa-Gavras thrillersThe Sleeping Car MurdersandZ--he even imported one of Costa-Gavras's favorite thugs, Marcel Bozzuffi, to play the Euro-trash hit man plugged by Doyle in an elevated train station. There was an impressive official sequel in 1975,French Connection II, directed by John Frankenheimer, which took Popeye to the south of France and got him hooked on horse. A couple of semi-official spinoffs followed,The Seven-Ups, which elevated Scheider to the leading role, andBadge 373, with Robert Duvall stepping in as the pugnacious flatfoot.--David Chute", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000003KDG", "6300214567", "6300216500", "0790738139", "6305261296", "630442972X", "630407185X", "0790734079", "0790733897", "0790743531", "1558807780", "630321245X", "6300247384", "6301965701", "0792837916", "0800100832", "6304429274", "6300181340", "6300213900", "6302799163", "6303212263", "6302909023", "B00008R9K9", "B000007PI9", "0766202771", "B00005A1VH"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 82875}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6302238331", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K7T6QP3QL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The French Connection [VHS]"}

{"description": "This cut-rate sequel toDracula, sans Bela Lugosi, turns out to be an unexpectedly sleek and stylish movie. Gloria Holden, tall, dark, and continental, is the aristocratic title character fighting her nature and seeking a cure for her affliction. A sympathetic psychiatrist, Dr.&nbsp;Garth (Otto Kruger), encourages her to \"face her fears,\" but when she lures a pretty young streetwalker to her room to model for a painting, the temptation of her fleshy offering proves too much to overcome. Edward Van Sloan reprises his role as Van Helsing, held by the police for the murder of Count Dracula (the film opens on the final scene fromDracula) but released in the nick of time to help Garth, now at the mercy of the bitter and vindictive vampire. Director Lambert Hillyer makes the most of his low budget, with austere, angular sets and an almost abstract sense of the foggy city night. Holden's mysterious face and tall, willowy body make her an even more striking vampire than Lugosi, and Irving Pichel's offbeat servant is like an American gangster with the breeding of a European aristocrat: thick and thuggish, but always proper. The script falls into the usual rut of Universal's later horror films, losing the mood in the busy plot, but the smooth style and Holden's dignified performance lift this above most Universal sequels.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301005783", "6302526167", "6300183084", "6300183629", "630252542X", "6302843219", "6302843227", "6302841771", "6302526140", "6302526094", "6300181278", "630284178X", "6302841763", "630252587X", "6302526086", "6300185443", "6300183092", "6301257014", "6302526191", "6300185281", "6302843200", "6303046436", "6303626475", "6302843197", "6300181286", "6302841844", "6303129188", "1564427099", "6303129013", "0792846737", "6302841798"], "bought_together": ["6301005783", "6300183084"], "also_viewed": ["6300181278", "6302843197", "6302841879", "6302841763", "6302526086", "630252587X", "6301257014", "6300183092", "6302526140", "630252542X", "B00005LC4J", "6300181286", "6302841771", "6302526191", "6302843200", "630312917X", "6302843219", "6303129145", "630284178X", "6303129013", "6301005783", "B0001CNRLG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 334333}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 29.2, "brand": "", "asin": "6302526175", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5131HT366YL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dracula's Daughter [VHS]"}

{"description": "William Wharton's autobiographical novel of World War II becomes a  moving portrait of war's madness in the microcosm of a small intelligence patrol on the German front in 1944. The unit, composed of high IQ soldiers, is sent to scout ahead. They discover a small platoon of Germans hiding in the forest, but these soldiers would rather fight with snowballs than guns and exchange Christmas presents instead of mortar fire. The young, rather unsoldierly Americans are offered the opportunity to \"capture\" the Germans without a fight--until a fatal misunderstanding plunges their efforts into tragedy. Director Keith Gordon, who also penned the screenplay, creates an unusually eloquent, offbeat platoon drama shot amidst the tranquil beauty of a snow-covered forest. His excellent cast includes future stars Ethan Hawke and Gary Sinise, with Frank Whaley, Kevin Dillon, Arye Gross, and Peter Berg rounding out the platoon. Though little seen upon its 1992 release, this moving drama received high praise for its vivid characters and delicately wrought imagery and remains one of the most powerful pacifist dramas of the post-war era.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 270799}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 26.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6302588626", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515XM58H10L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Midnight Clear [VHS]"}
{"description": "Throughout his long, wandering, often distinguished career Francis Ford Coppola has made many films that are good and fine, many more that are flawed but undeniably interesting, and a handful of duds that are worth viewing if only because his personality is so flagrantly absent. Yet he is and always shall be known as the man who directed theGodfatherfilms, a series that has dominated and defined their creator in a way perhaps no other director can understand. Coppola has never been able to leave them alone, whether returning after 15 years to make a trilogy of the diptych, or re-editing the first two films into chronological order for a separate video release asThe Godfather Saga. The films are our very own Shakespearean cycle: they tell a tale of a vicious mobster and his extended personal and professional families (once the stuff of righteous moral comeuppance), and they dared to present themselves with an epic sweep and an unapologetically tragic tone. Murder, it turned out, was a serious business. The first film remains a towering achievement, brilliantly cast and conceived. The entry of Michael Corleone into the family business, the transition of power from his father, the ruthless dispatch of his enemies--all this is told with an assurance that is breathtaking to behold. And it turned out to be merely prologue; two years laterThe Godfather, Part IIbalanced Michael's ever-greater acquisition of power and influence during the fall of Cuba with the story of his father's own youthful rise from immigrant slums. The stakes were higher, the story's construction more elaborate, and the isolated despair at the end wholly earned. (Has there ever been a cinematic performance greater than Al Pacino's Michael, so smart and ambitious, marching through the years into what he knows is his own doom with eyes open and hungry?)The Godfather, Part IIIwas mostly written off as an attempted cash-in, but it is a wholly worthy conclusion, less slow than autumnally patient and almost merciless in the way it brings Michael's past sins crashing down around him even as he tries to redeem himself.--Bruce Reid", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302054982", "6304025831", "6301792734", "6305123616", "6302383455", "B000059HFB", "6300271617", "B0000DI87S", "6304233639", "0792151712", "B00005PJ6V", "6303029027", "6300183211", "B000C20VRS", "6301574117", "0792158261", "6300214826", "B0000A36J1", "0790731975", "0783222149", "6304994540", "630354231X", "6304508611", "B00011CZRE", "6301977742", "B00003CXOO", "B00005NOHP", "B00000K3AN", "6301963911", "B000059HGY", "B000005QWI", "B00005NKW1", "6301628454", "6302822688", "6304285116", "B00000K2SO", "B000054OW2", "6302909023", "6302305934", "B00000FZCU", "0792845684", "6304071876", "B00005ATQA", "6305169187", "630268644X", "B00004W9C7", "B00004CIOV", "0800116917", "B00000K2SC", "B000067IXQ"], "also_viewed": ["6302383455", "B0019L770A", "B000003KHS", "0792174909", "B00EN09FKO", "630021639X", "B000059HFB", "6304467567", "0792152808", "B00BBND56G", "B002J40X0C", "6301792734", "0800116917", "B00000J2KZ", "0793558107", "B0000DI87S", "B0019L21GA", "0792158261", "6305363668", "6300183211", "0684836475", "6304443064", "6302158176", "B000930DLO", "B00006AL1C", "0792151712", "B000028U3S", "B00AEBB9DM", "B0018U250O", "B00AQJ8MLY", "6305123616", "B006TTC5DQ", "B00000F3SE", "B007STBUIW", "B002M2Z3BA", "B00J2R3VZI", "B00ITAQ2MS", "B0071JADFU", "B001UCJVJI", "B000LPS4BG", "B001FB55H6", "B002VWNIAY", "B008Y1YK0I", "B005FDXT32", "B005LAIIJY", "B000K6TOK6", "B00E9PMMX0", "B00KCTG4PO", "B00H9KKKAY"]}, "price": 30.59, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 105101}, "asin": "6302610702", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41yBN5Ti01L._SX300_.jpg", "title": "The Godfather Collection [VHS]"}

{"description": "Poor Joan Crawford just can't get a break.

Her pretty sculptress daughter (Diane Baker) just wants Mom to return to society and a happy, well-adjusted life... or does she?  The plot is a little trite and predictable, the direction a bit staid, but it's all Joan's show anyway. Obviously director William Castle told her to play up her character's insanity, and Crawford turns the knob on the acting meter up to 10, then breaks it off and throws it away. She spectacularly mugs her way through the whole film, abruptly changing from severe schoolmarm to trampy vamp and back again several times. The scene where Mom meets her daughter's fianc&eacute;e for the first time is particularly memorable; Mom guzzles half an iced-tea glass full of bourbon, then crawls all over the boyfriend while the viewer squirms uncomfortably. Back in '64, lucky moviegoers were given little cardboard axes  when this feature made its run in the theaters. Sadly, the cardboard axes are  long gone, but this is still highly recommended for fans of Crawford, Castle,  and high-powered thespianism in general.--Jerry Renshaw", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303962068"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 331860}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 34.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6302799171", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WJ5Q02HRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Strait Jacket [VHS]"}

{"description": "This absolutely charming, wholly engaging romantic comedy is the hidden gem of the four collaborations of Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant. Most everyone's seenThe Philadelphia Story, but few know of this unorthodox, hilarious comedy of life among the rich and privileged, though both were Broadway hits by playwright Philip Barry. Grant plays the happy-go-lucky Johnny Case, a self-made man with a dream in his heart of making just enough money to retire on and then traveling around the world. Johnny proposes to the lovely Julia (Doris Nolan) in Lake Placid, but it isn't until he comes to pay her a visit in New York that he discovers she's the daughter of a wealthy industrialist. Although his nonconformity ruffles the feathers of Julia's stuffy father, he's soon won over the whole family--most notably, Julia's rebellious sister Linda (Hepburn), who in becoming Johnny's greatest advocate finds herself irresistibly drawn to him. There's more going on here than a spiffy, surface romance, with Johnny's free-spirit determination going up against rock-hard establishment values, and director George Cukor plays up the social politics of the story just as well as the wonderful, exquisite romance. Hepburn and Grant, as always, are perfectly paired, and given able support by Lew Ayres as the black sheep of Hepburn's family, and Edward Everett Horton and Jean Dixon as Grant's longtime pals. Filmed previously in 1930; Hepburn understudied the role of Linda on Broadway and used a scene from the play in her first screen test.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000040EO", "6302990076", "630150528X", "0792839846", "6302227127", "6304383177", "0782006779", "6302305950", "630310245X", "6302208920", "6303102441", "6301278437", "6304525125", "6302798434", "6301328531", "B000PYKZYC", "6304056958", "6303333079", "6302725542", "0792840836", "B0000049FG", "6302484448", "6301973267", "0790744759", "6301987845", "1559838450", "B006P0UQ2G", "630266232X", "630299005X", "6301964012", "6303364772", "0783215096", "6301670140", "B00005LMA7", "6304111398", "6302011035", "6301798503", "0792837630", "6301967410", "0792837649"], "also_viewed": ["B008D1Q1VU", "B000A8AX6I"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 332020}, "asin": "630290899X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510FZJEFSHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Holiday [VHS]"}

{"description": "Ingmar Bergman's 1956 film has been parodied by everyone fromWoody Allen toBill and Ted's Bogus Journey, but it remains one of the strangest and richest classics of world cinema. Max Von Sydow plays a knight returning from the Crusades to encounter an apocalyptic scenario inspired by the Book of Genesis. He plays chess with Death (Bengt Ekerot), sees a manacled witch, watches a band of flagellants go by--all of it foretelling an inevitable end to life. Unabashedly allegorical and lyrical and existing in a world unto itself, the film is enormously mesmerizing no matter what one thinks of the weighty meanings Bergman has attached to it all.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302783356", "6304209584", "6303107346", "6302783348", "6302641888", "6300150151", "B00000J2L7", "B00005NC4X", "6301025083", "1572524448", "6302718910", "B000001A5E", "6302969352", "6300147908", "B00005ATQA", "6303107354"], "bought_together": ["6302783356", "6303107346"], "also_viewed": ["6302783356", "6303107346", "6302641888"]}, "price": 9.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 369038}, "asin": "6303107338", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412D1M83FTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Seventh Seal [VHS]"}

{"description": "David Lean focused all his talent as an epic-maker on Boris Pasternak's sweeping novel about a doctor-poet in revolutionary Russia. The results may sometimes veer toward soap opera, especially with the screen frequently filled with adoring close-ups of Omar Sharif and Julie Christie, but Lean's gift for cramming the screen with spectacle is not to be denied. The streets of Moscow, the snowy steppes of Russia, the house in the country taken over by ice; these are re-created with Lean's unerring sense of grandness. The movie is so lush and so long that it becomes an irresistible wallow, even when logic suffers--likeGone with the Windbefore it andTitanicafter. Sharif, who achieved stardom in Lean's previous film,Lawrence of Arabia, mostly looks noble, but the supporting cast is spiky: Rod Steiger as a fat-cat monster, Tom Courtenay as a self-righteous revolutionary, and Klaus Kinski and Alec Guinness in smaller roles. Geraldine Chaplin, in her adult debut, plays the doctor's compliant wife.

{"description": "Ever since this convoluted thriller dazzled audiences and critics in 1995 and won an Oscar for Christopher McQuarrie's twisting screenplay,The Usual Suspectshas continued to divide movie lovers into opposite camps. While a lot of people take great pleasure from the movie's now-famous central mystery (namely, \"Who is Keyser S&ouml;ze?\"), others aren't so easily impressed by a movie that's too enamored of its own cleverness to make much sense. After all, what are we to make of a final scene that renders the entire movie obsolete? Half the fun ofThe Usual Suspectsis the debate it provokes and the sheer pleasure of watching its dynamic cast in action, led (or should we say, mislead) by Oscar-winner Kevin Spacey as the club-footed con man who recounts the saga of enigmatic Hungarian mobster Keyser S&ouml;ze. Spacey's in a band of thieves that includes Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Pollak, and Benicio Del Toro, all gathered in a plot to steal a large shipment of cocaine. The story is told in flashback as a twisted plot being described by Spacey's character to an investigating detective (Chazz Palmintieri), andThe Usual Suspectsis enjoyable for the way it keeps the viewer guessing right up to its surprise ending. Whether that ending will enhance or extinguish the pleasure is up to each viewer to decide. Even if it ultimately makes little or no sense at all, this is a funny and fiendish thriller, guaranteed to entertain even its vocal detractors.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0800125762", "0800125789", "6302935148", "0783222955", "B00005QATY", "B00003CWL5", "6304259131", "6300215741"], "also_viewed": ["6304140851"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 469637}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6303908306", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z2K7HPEJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Usual Suspects, Letterbox Edition  [VHS]"}
{"description": "This superbly acted, mordantly funny romp through 70&nbsp;years or so of Roman history is one of the best-loved miniseries ever made, and deservedly so. Derek Jacobi plays Roman Emperor Claudius, who reflects in old age on his life and his remarkable family, giving us a history lesson that's unlike anything you learned in school.The story begins in 24&nbsp;B.C. during the reign of Augustus Caesar, Rome's  first emperor, and ends in A.D.&nbsp;54 with Nero on the throne. In between,I, Claudiusdetails the scheming, murder, madness, and lust that passed for politics in the early years of the Pax Romana. The biggest worm in the Roman apple is Augustus's wife, Livia (the superb Si&acirc;n Phillips), whose single-minded pursuit of power shapes the destiny of the Empire. With a carefully planted rumor here and a poisoned fig there, she gradually maneuvers her son, Tiberius, toward the throne, creating an atmosphere of suspicion and treachery that starts Rome on its helter-skelter slide into bloody chaos. Phillips somehow makes us understand this extraordinarily wicked woman. As she ages and her carefully wrought webs begin to unravel, it becomes clear that Livia has been as thoroughly poisoned by her own ambition as her victims were by her carefully prepared meals.Further acting honors go to George Baker as Tiberius, who resists but eventually succumbs to the destiny forced upon him by his mother, and to John Hurt as a hilarious and absolutely terrifying Caligula. In one breathtakingly tense scene, the mad Emperor performs a dance in drag, then asks Claudius to critique it, perfectly capturing the horror of a world where one wrong word means death, or worse. Jacobi is the perfect Claudius, hiding his intelligence behind a crippling stammer and shuffling around the edges of events--until he finds himself pulled to the very center. His wry comments give shape to the tangled story of his family and help the audience make sense of a dauntingly complex cast of characters.I, Claudiusmight seem a little studio-bound to viewers brought up on more recent big-budget costume dramas, but the topnotch cast and the incident-filled plot are more than enough to hold the attention through almost 11&nbsp;hours of gripping, deliciously wicked Roman follies. This boxed set also includes a documentary entitled \"The Epic That Never Was,\" about Alexander Korda's failed attempt to filmI, Claudiusin 1937. The film, directed by Josef von Sternberg and starring Charles Laughton as Claudius and Merle Oberon as Messalina, was abandoned unfinished, and it remains one of Hollywood's great lost movies.--Simon Leake", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302676185", "630354231X", "6302075270"], "also_viewed": ["B006JY3OHW", "6302075270"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 306411}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.93, "brand": "", "asin": "6303980813", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AV6N7YYFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "I, Claudius [VHS]"}
{"description": "This Russian-made study of Cuba, partially written by renowned poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko, captures the island just before it made the transition to a post-revolutionary society. Moving from city to country and back again, I AM CUBA examines the various problems caused by political oppression as well as by great discrepancies in wealth and power.\n\nBeginning in Havana in the pre-Castro era, we see how foreigners contributed to the city's prostitution and poverty; this sequence features dreamy, hallucinogenic camera work that creates a feeling of unease and dislocation. Then, in glorious images of palm tress and fertile land, the film looks at the sugar cane fields in the countryside, and the difficulties faced by peasants working the land. Finally, back in the city again, leftist students battle the police and a corrupt government--and pay a high price for their rebellion.", "price": 44.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 520561}, "asin": "630396835X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QT7SPK4GL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "I Am Cuba [VHS]"}

He flies missions and trains pilots and, hoping for redemption, founds an orphanage.Director Douglas Sirk, much as he did with an earlier Hudson vehicle, MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION, crafts a riveting, poignant melodrama around the themes of guilt and redemption.

{"description": "This brilliant film manages to reinterpret the story of Victor Hugo's  classic novel, critique it, and investigate the nature of art and life on top of  that--all in three hours that zip past, fueled by the dynamic performance of  French icon Jean-Paul Belmondo (Breathless,Le Doulos). In 1900,  Henri Fortin (Belmondo) is wrongfully imprisoned for murder; his loyal wife is  forced into menial labor and prostitution; then in the beginning of World War  II, Fortin's son (Belmondo again) helps a Jewish family elude the Nazis, setting  in motion his own imprisonment, escape, and adventures as a criminal. Not only  is that just the first half of the movie, there are also the story lines of the  husband, wife, and daughter of the Jewish family, who each have their own  struggles.

{"description": "John Travolta is Vic Deakins, a bomber pilot who launches a devilish plan to hijack two nuclear missiles for big-time extortion. Vic never sweats, spews out great one-liners, knocks off money men with glee, toys with killing half a million people... he even smokes!If you giggled at his \"Ain't it cool\" line from the trailer, you're in the right frame of mind for this comedic action film. Never as gritty or semi-realistic--or for that matter as heart-thumping--as the originalDie Hard,Broken Arrowstill delivers. If Travolta is cast against type, everyone else is by the numbers; Christian Slater as Hale, the earnest copilot looking to foil the plot, Samantha Mathis as the brave park ranger caught in the middle, Frank Whaley as an eager diplomat, Delroy Lindo as a right-minded colonel. As with his previous script (the superiorSpeed), writer Graham Yost moves everything quickly along as Hale and the ranger try to cut off Deakins's plan over a variety of terrains. We have plane crashes, car chases, a pursuit through an abandoned mine, a helicopter-train shootout, and lots of fighting between boys. Each time Hale finds himself perfectly in place to foil Deakins. You're suppose to laugh at the unbelievable situations. That's whereArrowis deceptive: its tone is right for the laughter compared to the mean-spirited Schwarzenegger and Stallone action films with labored jokes. Hong Kong master director John Woo (The Killer,Hard Target) pulls out all the stops--slow motion of Hale and Deakins's gymnastic gun play, nifty stunts, countdowns to doomsday. Woo may know action, but he needs more guidance in creating unique and stunning special effects. This is action entertainment at its cheesiest.

{"description": "In this screen version of the James Thurber-Elliot Nugent Broadway play of the same name, Henry Fonda stars as bespectacled, bookish college professor Tommy Turner, who puts his career on the line by insisting upon standing up for his right to free speech. Determining to read a letter written by executed anarchistic Bartolomeo Vanzetti to his classroom,Tommy not only risks dismissal and castigation by the conservative college trustees, but seriously jeopardizes his marriage to his wife Ellen (Olivia DeHavilland), who wishes that Tommy would stop making waves and start lobbying for a raise. Coinciding with all this is the arrival of former college football star Joe Ferguson (Jack Carson), who many years earlier had been Tommy's rival for Ellen's affections. Eminently successful and aggressively athletic, Joe seems to be everything that Tommy isn't, and the little professor is worried that he's going to lose Ellen to Joe after all. An all-night drinking session with equally idealistic student Michael Barnes (Herbert Anderson) convinces Tommy to stick to his principles no matter what the cost-and miracle of miracles, this resolve makes him a hero in everyone's eyes, including sweet Ellen.

{"description": "Some people may sneer at this 1965 musical, but the truth is the film has earned its status as a perennially watchable romantic-drama, largely on the strength of a fun story and chemistry between stars Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer. Veteran filmmaker Robert Wise (The Day the Earth Stood Still) mostly stays out of the way of the film's appealing elements, which include a based-on-fact tale of Austria's von Trapp family, who fled their Nazi-occupied country in 1938. Andrews is delightful and even fascinating as Maria, who sheds her tomboyish ways as a novice nun to accept the mantle of adulthood, becoming matron of the motherless von Trapp clan. Plummer is matinee-idol handsome and gives a smart performance to boot, and the cast of young people and kids who make up the singing von Trapp children make a strong impression. Based on the Rodgers and Hammerstein stage musical, the score includes such winners as \"Maria\" and the future John Coltrane hit \"My Favorite Things.\"--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304400551", "6304178352", "6305123616", "B00000JS61", "6305282927", "B00000F6D1", "630233683X", "6304151306", "6302526574", "6303494390", "0792839846", "0792839129", "155890641X", "6303215734", "0788802194", "0788812807", "6301390725", "6303314015", "0788812408", "630150528X", "0790744759", "6303444202", "6300263673", "6302787068", "6304401132", "6302320402", "0788805533", "B00004TRD5", "6300246787", "6303854311", "B000056BRF", "0788805843", "0792151712", "B0041GWWUK", "6304500831", "6302091632", "6303168507", "630197736X", "6301586026", "6300207919", "6302642248", "6300215695", "0788806270", "B00005LL26", "B0000048YM", "6304089767", "5559477621", "6300275310", "6305229449", "6302178924", "6300277089", "6305750750", "6304331851", "6302936381", "B00000JKNP", "6300181111", "B0000AQZYM", "6300215814", "6300215830", "6300274195", "B002M2Z3BA", "6300213668", "B000035Z2S", "0788803743", "B00000491O", "B00000I1EM", "B00005RRG3", "B002HK9IDQ", "6301796535", "6305940932", "0783222955", "6303315305", "6302271991", "6301966317", "B00004RV8M", "0792840836", "6304100507", "6301972279", "0792837614", "6304546262", "B00005RRG5", "6303929338", "6302150620", "6300182304", "6305326940", "078881172X", "B0000E32WB", "6302816246", "6300215741", "6301792734", "B0000633ZP", "0800132009", "B00005RRG6", "B0002F6BQU", "B000059HH1", "6305177473", "B0000VCZKM", "6301971531", "0792839749"], "bought_together": ["6304400551"], "also_viewed": ["6304400551", "6304178352", "6303314015", "6305123616", "155890641X", "0788812408", "B00000JS61", "0788802194", "6302526574", "6302642248", "0792839129", "6305282927", "B00000F6D1", "078881172X", "6304500831", "6300274268", "6302158095", "6303215734", "B000035Z2S", "6304151306", "6304143184", "0792151712", "0788805843", "6304401132", "6302787068", "6300213668", "0788806270", "6301969707", "630233683X", "6305326940", "0792839846", "6305750750", "B00005LL26", "6302178924", "6304978286", "5559477621", "6303036813", "6303494390", "B00000JKNP", "6304539258", "6304873441", "6301792769", "6304290888", "6304718551", "B0041GWWUK", "B000003KHS", "6304089767", "6303929338", "6302091632", "6302961572", "B0007KTBIU", "6300263673", "6303675212", "6301752627", "6301792734", "B00FWMVVLS", "0783229011", "6304539274", "B00004TRD5"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 84952}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.94, "brand": "", "asin": "6304117752", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AESVTB4DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Sound of Music [VHS]"}

{"description": "\"The love impulse in man,\" says a psychiatrist inBringing Up Baby, \"frequently reveals itself in terms of conflict.\" That's for sure. For a primer on the rules and regulations of the classic screwball comedy, which throws love and conflict into close proximity, look no further. A straight-laced paleontologist (Cary Grant) loses a dinosaur bone to a dog belonging to free-spirited heiress Katharine Hepburn. In trying to retrieve said bone, Grant is drawn into the vortex surrounding the delicious Hepburn, which becomes a flirtatious pas de deux that will transform both of them. Director Howard Hawks plays the complications as a breathless escalation of their \"love impulse,\" yet the movie is nonetheless romantic for all its speed. (Hawks'sHis Girl Friday, also with Grant, goes even faster.) Grant and Hepburn are a match made in movie heaven, in sync with each other throughout.

{"description": "Dashing Errol Flynn is the definitive Robin Hood in the most gloriously swashbuckling version of the legendary story. Warner Brothers reunited Michael Curtiz, their top-action director, with the winning team of Flynn and Olivia de Havilland (Maid Marian) and perennial villain Basil Rathbone as the aristocratic Sir Guy of Gisbourne, and pulled out all stops for the production. It became their costliest film to date, a grandly handsome, glowing Technicolor adventure set to a stirring,Oscar-winning scoreby Erich Wolfgang Korngold. The decadent Prince John (a smoothly conniving Claude Rains) takes advantage of King Richard's absence to tax the country into poverty but meets his match in the medieval guerrilla rebel Robin Hood and his Merry Men of Sherwood Forest, who rise up and, to quote a clich&eacute; coined by the film, \"steal from the rich and give to the poor.\" Stocky Alan Hale Sr. plays Robin's loyal friend Little John (a part he played in Douglas Fairbanks's silent version), Eugene Palette the portly Friar Tuck, and Melville Cooper the bumbling Sheriff of Nottingham. Flynn's confidence and cocky charm makes for a perfect Robin Hood, and his easygoing manner is a marvelous counterpoint to Rathbone's regal bearing and courtly diction. The film climaxes in their rousing battle-to-the-finish sword fight, a magnificently choreographed scene highlighted by Curtiz's inventive use of shadows cast upon the castle walls.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302120527", "6301976932", "6301977181", "6301977149", "6303212263", "6305123616", "B00004RFHL", "6301574117", "0790743159", "6300214060", "B00005A1VH", "6304178352", "0792839846", "630233683X", "6301977173", "6302961688", "630150528X", "6304935811", "B00005RRG6", "B00000JKNP", "6301973305", "6301670140", "1558800034", "0792107683", "B00004RGUU", "0782008348"], "bought_together": ["6301977149"], "also_viewed": ["B00005PJ8I"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 538065}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6304546386", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RMAFMQ02L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Adventures of Robin Hood [VHS]"}

{"description": "One of the greatest screen biographies ever produced, this monumental film runs nearly three hours, won seven Academy Awards, and gave George C. Scott the greatest role of his career. It was released in 1970 when protest against the Vietnam War still raged at home and abroad, and many critics and moviegoers struggled to reconcile current events with the movie's glorification of Gen. George S. Patton as a crazy-brave genius of World War II.How could a movie so huge in scope and so fascinated by its subject be considered an anti-war film? The simple truth is that it's not--Patton is less about World War II than about the rise and fall of a man whose life was literally defined by war, and who felt lost and lonely without the grand-scale pursuit of an enemy. George C. Scott embodies his role so fully, so convincingly, that we can't help but be drawn to and fascinated by Patton as a man who is simultaneously bound for hell and glory. The film's opening monologue alone is a masterful display of acting and character analysis, and everything that follows is sheer brilliance on the part of Scott and director Franklin J. Schaffner.Filmed on an epic scale at literally dozens of European locations, Patton does not embrace war as a noble pursuit, nor does it deny the reality of war as a breeding ground for heroes. Through the awesome achievement of Scott's performance and the film's grand ambition, Patton shows all the complexities of a man who accepted his role in life and (like Scott) played it to the hilt.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303057225", "0800132009", "B0007TKNGA", "6304071876", "6302909023", "6301966317", "6300181472", "B000059HGY", "6300214826", "6300268748", "079213690X", "630407185X", "B00000K3AN", "6301797906", "6301115430", "079284646X", "0790701251", "0790752395", "6302529441", "0783221347", "B00000F13T", "6300216543", "B00006C7G9", "6304151306", "B00005LL26", "630018224X", "6301971809", "6301965817", "6300181340", "630442972X", "6300988473", "630105573X", "0783216084", "6301777867", "B00003CXTF", "B000003KDG", "6303020089", "6301969251", "B000003KHS", "B00004CNR5", "6301662954", "0784011923", "B00000FZCU", "6300215962", "0800100832", "1569942072", "B00003CXE6", "6300271846", "6300181154", "630274721X", "0790734079", "0764004638", "0800125762", "6302415853", "6301976622", "630018627X", "B00005A1VG", "B000007OY0", "B000068TSI", "B00005ATQA", "0800116917", "6300216802", "6303696813", "6300267830", "0790758474", "0792116887", "0783235607", "630197154X", "B00005Q4GY", "B0000048YO", "6302224330", "0800106032", "6303824358", "B000056BRF", "6304457278", "6300267938", "6300182304"], "bought_together": ["6303057225"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 219212}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.74, "brand": "", "asin": "6304935811", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/418V1BMMHEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Patton [VHS]"}
{"description": "After the tight plotting and quirky intensity ofFargo, this casually amusing follow-up from the prolifically inventive Coen (Ethan and Joel) brothers seems like a bit of a lark, and the result was a box-office disappointment. The good news is,The Big Lebowskiis every bit a Coen movie, and its lazy plot is part of its laidback charm. After all, how many movies can claim as their hero a pot-bellied, pot-smoking loser named Jeff \"The Dude\" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) who spends most of his time bowling and getting stoned? And where else could you find a hairnetted Latino bowler named Jesus (John Turturro) who sports dazzling purple footgear, or an erotic artist (Julianne Moore) whose creativity consists of covering her naked body in paint, flying through the air in a leather harness, and splatting herself against a giant canvas? Who else but the Coens would think of showing you a camera view from inside the holes of a bowling ball, or an elaborate Busby Berkely-styled musical dream sequence involving a Viking goddess and giant bowling pins? The plot--which finds Lebowski involved in a kidnapping scheme after he's mistaken for a rich guy with the same name--is almost beside the point. What counts here is a steady cascade of hilarious dialogue, great work from Coen regulars John Goodman and Steve Buscemi, and the kind of cinematic ingenuity that puts the Coens in a class all their own.

{"description": "Richard Lester's 1975 sequel to his rompingThree Musketeers--released the year before--reunites his swashbuckling cast for a decidedly less happy and more somber experience. This time, D'Artagnan (Michael York) and his Musketeer mentors (Richard Chamberlain, Oliver Reed, Frank Finlay) have a tougher fight against their old enemies, and the adventure is not without its casualties.

The actors are with him every step of the way: Reed, Chamberlain, Finlay, and York are a heroic version of the Marx brothers, Raquel Welch was never better, and Charlton Heston clearly enjoys playing the evil Cardinal Richelieu.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305037264", "6305428077", "B00028G7GQ", "B003BJODK0", "B007Y1NR1W", "B0087ZG7HK", "B00023GG9Y", "6305162034"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003BJODK0", "6305428077", "B00028G7GQ", "0792839137"]}, "price": 44.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 82995}, "asin": "6305037256", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EZ5AKRZAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Four Musketeers"}

They're all part of Mel Brooks's wild and wacky first film, THE PRODUCERS. In this hysterical farce, rapacious but lovable producer Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) hasn't had a hit in years and resorts to fulfilling sexually crazed little old ladies' fantasies for extra cash. But when he meets his new meek, neurotic accountant, Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder), the two accidentally come up with a plot to oversell shares in a surefire flop musical and make off with the profits. The plan sends the new partners-in-crime on a search for the worst play ever: SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER, written by an ex-Nazi (Kenneth Mars) whose only friends are the filthy city pigeons he keeps on his roof. Inspired, manic performances by all involved, along with Brooks's lively direction--which affectionately alludes to such MGM Golden Age musicals as SINGIN' IN THE RAIN--make THE PRODUCERS both referential and highly original as it moves along swiftly to the ultimate musical climax.", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301797973", "630281622X", "6305576173", "6300247112"], "bought_together": ["6301797973"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 552537}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6305112878", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/215KFPD56ZL.jpg", "title": "Producers [VHS]"}

{"description": "Halloweenis one of the great modern horror films, but as a franchise its track record has been spotty at best, painfully bad at worst.Halloween H2O: Twenty Years Later, directed by horror vet Steve Miner (Friday the 13thparts 2 and 3,House), won't displace John Carpenter's original but it might help you forget the films in between. Miner certainly has: the film begins as if sequels 3 through 6 never happened. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis, reprising her role for the first time in almost two decades) faked her death and is now a single mom and headmistress of an exclusive California private school. She's also a secret alcoholic who lives in fear of her homicidal brother-bogeyman Michael Myers. Guess who decides to show up for a family reunion? The film begins with classic horror-movie exposition (the deserted college campus, Michael's escape, Laurie's waking nightmares) accomplished with some humor and style, but it's all setup for the second half, a driving roller coaster of stalk-and-slash thrills. There's little of the self-conscious genre referencing ofScreamand at times the film is a little far-fetched--it is a slasher movie about a knife-wielding homicidal maniac who won't stay dead, after all--but Curtis transforms Laurie from a shrieking victim into an empowered, determined horror-movie heroine who's learned a thing or two from the previous films.

{"description": "Saturday Night Feverit's not--call it more likeSunday  Morning Leftovers. This portrait of the legendary Manhattan disco and its colorful cofounder, Steve Rubell, plays like the outtakes of a much more interesting film--where's the sex, the drugs, the classic disco music? (It shouldn't surprise viewers that Miramax and writer-director Mark Christopher had a falling-out over the final cut of the film; Miramax prevailed.) Considering that the essence of Studio&nbsp;54 was about the rich and beautiful, it seems a bit unwise to focus on the poor and  only-somewhat-beautiful, namely Shane (Ryan Phillippe), a Jersey boy who gets taken in by the razzle-dazzle of the disco era. Crossing the river, Shane finds another, more exciting life at Studio&nbsp;54 as a shirtless bartender, and soon finds himself partying with the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me--and  smitten with comely soap star Julie (Neve Campbell). The permutations of the story are familiar; if you've never seen VH1'sBehind the Musicdocumentary take on Studio&nbsp;54 you'll find this film enjoyable, but unlike that exhaustive portrait, too many elements are missing. Most of Phillippe's performance seems to have ended up on the cutting-room floor (although his chiseled torso gets maximum exposure), Campbell's role is basically a glorified cameo, and Breckin Meyer and Salma Hayek, as Phillippe's only true pals, are wasted. The one true gem of the film, though, is Mike Myers's take on the late Steve Rubell, an inspired high-wire performance that balances humor and tragedy without ever giving in to camp or pathos. Had this been a more well-received movie, he'd be remembered come Oscar time--his drunken proposition of Philippe is a minor treasure. The soundtrack does feature some unknown chestnuts and a few new remixes, including an inspired disco version of--believe it or not--Gordon Lightfoot's \"If You Could Read My Mind.\"--Mark Englehart", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 272112}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6305210144", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71Z4BW48N8L._SY300_.gif", "title": "54 [VHS]"}

Ever had to endure a smarmy, condescending boss? ThenOffice Spaceshould hit pretty close to home for you. Peter (Ron Livingston) spends the day doing stupefyingly dull computer work in a cubicle. He goes home to an apartment sparsely furnished by IKEA and Target, then starts for a maddening commute to work again in the morning. His coworkers in the cube farm are an annoying lot, his boss is a snide, patronizing jerk, and his days are consumed with tedium. In desperation, he turns to career hypnotherapy, but when his hypno-induced relaxation takes hold, there's no shutting it off. Layoffs are in the air at his corporation, and with two coworkers (both of whom are slated for the chute) he devises a scheme to skim funds from company accounts. The scheme soon snowballs, however, throwing the three into a panic until the unexpected happens and saves the day. Director Mike Judge has come up with a spot-on look at work in corporate America circa 1999. With well-drawn characters and situations instantly familiar to the white-collar milieu, he captures the joylessness of many a cube denizen's work life to aT.

WithMary, they've created a consistently hilarious romantic comedy, made all the funnier by the fact that you know that they know that some of their gags go way over the line.Cameron Diaz stars as Mary, every guy's ideal. Ben Stiller plays a high-school suitor still hung up on Mary years later; the obstacles standing between him and her include a number of psychotic suitors, a miserable little pooch, and, oh yeah, a murder charge.The Farrellys' admittedly simplistic camera work, which adapts easily to a TV screen, and the fact that you'll likely laugh yourself so silly over certain scenes you'll want to replay them to see what you were missing while you were busy convulsing, make this a perfect video movie.--David Kronke", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300214567"], "also_viewed": ["B00004YZEG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 467528}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.01, "brand": "", "asin": "6305499071", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41T5QB162RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "There's Something About Mary (Special Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "It's, like, Shakespeare, man! This good-natured and likeable update ofThe Taming of the Shrewtakes the basics of Shakespeare's farce about a surly wench and the man who tries to win her and transfers it to modern-day Padua High School. Kat Stratford (Julia Stiles) is a sullen, forbidding riot grrrl who has a blistering word for everyone; her sunny younger sister Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) is poised for high school stardom. The problem: overprotective and paranoid Papa Stratford (a dryly funny Larry Miller) won't let Bianca date until boy-hating Kat does, which is to say never. When Bianca's pining suitor Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) gets wind of this, he hires the mysterious, brooding Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger) to loosen Kat up. Of course, what starts out as a paying gig turns to true love as Patrick discovers that underneath her brittle exterior, Kat is a regular babe. The script, by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith, is sitcom-funny with peppy one-liners and lots of smart teenspeak; however, its cleverness and imagination doesn't really extend beyond its characters' Renaissance names and occasional snippets of real Shakespearean dialogue. What makes the movie energetic and winning is the formula that helped makeShe's All Thatsuch a big hit: two high-wattage stars who look great and can really act. Ledger is a hunk of promise with a quick grin and charming Aussie accent, and Stiles mines Kat's bitterness and anger to depths usually unknown in teen films; her recitation of her English class sonnet (from which the film takes its title) is funny, heartbreaking, and hopelessly romantic. The imperious Allison Janney (Primary Colors) nearly steals the film as a no-nonsense guidance counselor secretly writing a trashy romance novel.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303853102", "6302998611", "6302787068", "6301796535", "B00006RCST", "630018403X", "6300183467", "6302091632", "0800109481", "6300214753", "6302968100", "6300263673", "6304978286"], "also_viewed": ["B005HY1P94"]}, "price": 10.53, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 177740}, "asin": "6305537798", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/712HBPMSPEL._SY300_.gif", "title": "10 Things I Hate About You [VHS]"}
{"description": "Volume 7 in this excellent DVD series of originalStar Trekprograms includes \"The Galileo Seven,\" which teleplay writer Oliver Crawford  says was inspired by his viewing of a 1939 film calledFive Came Back. (A catty footnote: David Gerrold, scribe of the famous \"The Trouble with Tribbles\"  episode, called \"The Galileo Seven\" a rip-off of the Jimmy Stewart filmThe Flight of the Phoenix. Meow.)Five Came Backconcerned a plane crash in the Andes and the survivors who faced the constant threat of surrounding headhunters. Crawford toyed with the idea and came up with a story  line in which Spock (Leonard Nimoy), Dr. McCoy (DeForest Kelley), and a couple  of other crew members crash on the surface of a hostile planet during a shuttle mission. With communication between the small craft and theEnterprisedisrupted by quasar activity, Spock and the others must defend  themselves against a formidable threat with only primitive, handmade weapons. That's the scenario, but the real drama is in the rising conflict  between the half-Vulcan Spock's coldly logical approach to survival and the  passions of his human crew, who soon come to regard him as a hateful, unfeeling monster. This is an interesting episode, both as a taut action piece and,  somewhat indirectly, as a portrait of intolerance (specifically, an intolerance  of individual differences) developing under stress.Also on this disc is \"Court Martial,\" a courtroom drama in which Captain Kirk (William Shatner) stands trial for negligence in the death of anEnterprisecrewman. As the proceedings rumble on, Spock investigates some  hidden truths about the dead man and the apparent computer malfunction that led to the  tragedy. While \"Court Martial\" is a lesser episode from theStar Trekcanon (the action is a bit mired in trial proceedings), it's still a  lot of fun and features a supporting role from veteran Hollywood character actor  Elisha Cook Jr.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00001MXXW", "B000022TTP", "0792160932", "6305744882", "B000055Z4J", "6305513406", "6305755035", "B00001MXXS", "B00004Y630", "B000059XU0", "B000022TTI", "B00004Y62Z", "B00005ASGJ", "B00005J6RE", "B0002JJBZO", "6305910464", "6305910537", "B00004W5UI", "0792160959", "6305513414", "B00005BCK7", "B00005KHK3", "B00005KHK4", "B00005J6RF", "B00005N5SE", "B00005QTAR", "B00005M2D0", "B00005BCK6", "B00004W5UH", "B00005ASGI", "B00005M2CZ", "B00005NVDI", "B000059XTZ", "B00005Q79B", "B00005QAPY", "B000055Z4I", "B00005N5SF", "B000A2S7VM", "B0000UJL96", "B004IIPUSC", "B00005QTAS", "B00DB97LRC", "B002I9Z8AS", "B00005NVDJ", "6305755043", "B000PMBEAI"], "bought_together": ["B000022TTP", "B000022TTI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001DHXT6G", "6305910537", "B00005KHK4", "B000055Z4J"]}, "price": 12.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 381790}, "asin": "630574484X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MB72WA9CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek - The Original Series, Vol. 7, Episodes 14 &amp; 15: The Galileo Seven/ Court-Martial"}

{"description": "One of the patients in an institution for the incurably insane was once its director, and a young psychiatrist (Robert Powell) has to figure outwhichone as they all tell him their stories. What better setting for a horror anthology? It's an inspired framing device, making this one of the better examples of the genre, even if screenwriter Robert Bloch at times resorts to gimmicks rather than invention. The first two stories are less than brilliant (the first is highlighted by dismembered body parts neatly wrapped in butcher paper wriggling back to life for revenge), but Charlotte Rampling and Britt Eklund are marvelous in the third tale, about a mentally unbalanced young woman and her dangerous best friend. Herbert Lom is also excellent in the final story as a scientist who carves an army of dolls he claims he can bring to life by sheer will power.Director Roy Ward Baker (Quatermas and the Pit) builds momentum with each story until the dark and deliciously bloody climax. This Amicus Studios production looks visually dull compared to Hammer's gothic gloss, but it features a great British cast (including Patrick Magee and Hammer stalwart Peter Cushing), and ultimately Baker makes that gloomy look work for his increasingly creepy production. Amicus produced a series of horror anthologies, including the original 1972Tales from the CryptandThe Torture Garden(also scripted by Bloch).--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000TUDBGG", "B000RXVNCO", "B0000A9GHP", "B000AM6OOY", "B000FFJZO2", "B0007VY558", "B0016LFUVQ", "B00B94VJYW", "B00EBDXTFU", "B000096I9X", "B00000F62P", "B0009X770O", "B003M8NGG2", "B008HSK3PE", "B00005NSXY", "B00006G8K0", "B005GPFZEK", "B005AMJ2ZM", "B000UAFDR0", "B00H7BJ0C4", "B005ETANC2", "B000E1P2EY", "B000062XEY", "B00000ILEU", "B0001CNRNE", "B001HPOJ68", "B001B9ZVVC", "B0007R4TR6", "B005CVFZ4I", "B00005NKTH", "B003XF1VY8", "B0000694WH", "B006TBYC76", "B000068TPG", "B0088R9KFI", "B0007R4SZY", "B003JIPN20", "B00D9EJFZA", "B000068TPF", "B001DXS4DI", "B00E3LUR6O", "B00009PY4D", "B0006L0LHK", "B003L1YESE", "B00EBDXVVW", "B00005R1O7", "B001BSBBGC", "B000GRUQJW", "B000TGJ89E", "B005HIBWBG", "B000GIW964", "B00FUABK36", "B00005LIRD", "B00D7AM71A", "B00FOLGW3E", "B0001FVE5O", "B003NOGNQU", "B00ICWO1LC", "B002FLOTPO", "B0007R4T26", "B006NOC0QO", "B00DOZNGC2", "B0002CX1M0", "B00005JOJE", "B00EU8RBZK", "B00JRENJTY", "B000RPCJ9I", "B00DOZNI8Y", "B000063UR0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000TGJ89E", "B000AM6OOY", "B0000A9GHP", "B000RXVNCO"]}, "price": 15.86, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 376522}, "asin": "6305870896", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SZSX6HYYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Asylum"}

{"description": "John Lasseter and his gang of high-tech creators at Pixar create another entertainment for the ages. Like the few great movie sequels,Toy Story&nbsp;2comments on why the first one was so wonderful while finding a fresh angle worthy of a new film. The craze of toy collecting becomes the focus here, as we find out Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) is not only a beloved toy to Andy but also a rare doll from a popular '60s children's show. When a greedy collector takes Woody, Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) launches a rescue mission with Andy's other toys. To say more would be a crime because this is one of the most creative and smile-inducing films since, well, the firstToy Story.Although the toys look the same as in the 1994 feature, Pixar shows how much technology has advanced: the human characters look more human, backgrounds are superior, and two action sequences that book-end the film are dazzling. And it's a hoot for kids and adults. The film is packed with spoofs, easily accessible in-jokes, and inspired voice casting (with newcomer Joan Cusack especially a delight as Cowgirl Jessie). But as the Pixar canon of films illustrates, the filmmakers are storytellers first. Woody's heart-tugging predicament can easily be translated into the eternal debate of living a good life versus living  forever.Toy Story&nbsp;2also achieved something in the U.S. two other outstanding 1999 animated features (The Iron Giant,Princess Mononoke) could not: it became a huge box-office hit.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304089767", "B00005JKDQ", "B0000AQZYM", "6305326940", "0788805843", "0788812408", "155890641X", "6303314015", "0788802194", "B000035Z2S", "0788805533", "6305229449", "078881172X", "6304500831", "0788812807", "6302526574", "6302642248", "6303983812", "B00003CXQX", "6304401132", "0788806270", "6302787068", "6305940932", "6302320402", "6304290888", "6303534422", "B00275EHJG", "B00004T2SI", "6305319138", "B00005JL95", "0788803743", "6302178924", "6300274268", "6304100507", "6305942285", "B00004R99N", "6300275310", "B00006CXK5", "B00003CXXI", "B00005JMQY", "6304400225", "6304400551", "6302961572", "6303122647", "6304501153", "B00005JKX3", "0788811002", "6300274195", "B0000E32WB", "6303929338", "B00005T7H6", "6304978286", "B00005RDVV", "B00016JF2W", "6302158095", "B0000524CZ", "6304401736", "B000035Z46", "B00003CXHR", "0788812440", "6303036813", "6304089201", "B0007A2GSM", "B00000JS61", "B000028U3S", "B00005RRG3", "6301991311", "B00003CWPW", "B00009L4S1", "6304400381", "6300274608", "B00003CXQ6", "B00000I7Q3", "0788812181", "B000AY74OQ", "6305559295", "0792153677", "B00005LOUS", "0788809806", "078880720X", "B000009CTR", "1558906150", "B00001YX9H", "6301390725", "B00007AJLB", "B00000J2JA", "6304434340", "0783221800", "B00000ICHA", "1558907718", "6303148387", "B00004T2SJ", "6304155972", "6303939015", "0788810448", "6301404440", "630169774X", "B00003CXQ0", "6302968143", "B00006IUM9"], "also_viewed": ["6304089767", "6303314015", "B00005JKDQ", "B0000AQZYM", "0788805843", "6302787068", "0788812408", "6305326940", "155890641X", "0788805533", "0788802194", "6305940932", "6302320402", "078881172X", "6305229449", "6302526574", "6304500831", "B000035Z2S", "B00003CXQX", "6303983812", "6302642248", "6304100507", "6300274195", "6304290888", "0788812807", "0788806270", "6303036813", "6300274268", "6305319138", "B00005JL95", "6304501153", "6300275310", "B00004T2SI", "6303534422", "6305942285", "6302178924", "B00003CXXI", "6304401132", "6302961572", "B0007KTBIU", "6304400551", "6303929338", "6304089201", "B00004R99N", "6304978286", "B0000524CZ", "B00275EHJG", "B00005JKX3", "B00000I7Q3", "B00003CXHR", "6304089112", "6302426200", "B0000E32WB", "B00006CXK5", "B0030IIZ4M", "6305310068", "6304401736", "B00016JF2W", "B000063V8N"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 182756}, "asin": "6305949557", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515BCFM46JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Toy Story 2 [VHS]"}

{"description": "A View to a Kill: Roger Moore's last outing as James Bond is evidence enough that it was time to pass the torch to another actor. Beset by crummy action (an out-of-control fire engine?) and featuring a fading Moore still trying to prop up his mannered idea of style, the film is largely interesting for Christopher Walken's quirky performance as a sort-of supervillain who wants to take out California's Silicon Valley. Grace Jones has a spookily interesting presence as a lethal associate of Walken's (and who, in the best Bond tradition, has sex with 007 before trying to kill him later), and Patrick Macnee (Steed!) has a warm if brief bit. Even directed by John Glen, who brought some crackle to the Moore years in the Bond franchise, this is a very slight effort. --Tom KeoghThunderball: James Bond's fourth adventure takes him to the Bahamas, where a NATO warplane with a nuclear payload has disappeared into the sea. Bond (Sean Connery) travels from a tiny health spa (where he tangles with a mechanized masseuse run amuck) to the casinos of Nassau and soon picks up the trail of SPECTRE's number-two man, Emilio Largo (Adolfo Celi), and his beautiful mistress, Domino (Claudine Auger), whom Bond soon seduces to his side. Equipped with more gadgets than ever, courtesy of the resourceful \"Q\" (Desmond Llewelyn), agent 007 escapes an ambush with a personal-size jet pack and takes to the water as he searches for the undersea plane, battles Largo's pet sharks, and finally leads the battle against Largo's scuba-equipped henchmen in a spectacular underwater climax. This thrilling Bond entry became Connery's most successful outing in the series and was remade in 1983 asNever Say Never Again, with Connery returning to the role after a 12-year hiatus. Tom Jones belts out the bold theme song to another classic Maurice Binder title sequence.  --Sean AxmakerDie Another Day: The 20th James Bond adventure,Die Another Daysucceeds on three important fronts: it avoids comparison to Austin Powers by keeping its cheesy humor in check, allows Halle Berry to be sexy and worthy of a spinoff franchise, and keeps pace with the technical wizardry that modern action films demand. Pierce Brosnan's got style and staying power as James Bond, now bearing little resemblance to Ian Fleming's original British super-spy, but able to hold his own at the box office. He's paired with American agent Jinx (Berry) in chasing a genetically altered North Korean villain (Rick Yune) armed with a satellite capable of destroying just about anything. John Cleese and Judi Dench reprise their recurring roles (as \"Q\" and \"M,\" respectively); they're accompanied by weapons-laden sports cars, a hokey cameo by Madonna (who sings the techno-pulsed theme song), and enough double-entendres to keep Bond-philes adequately shaken and stirred. With clever nods to 007's cinematic legacy,Die Another Daymakes you welcome the familiar end-credits promise: James Bond will return. --Jeff ShannonThe Spy Who Loved Me: The best of the James Bond adventures starring Roger Moore as tuxedoed Agent 007, this globe-trotting thriller introduced the steel-toothed Jaws (played by seven-foot-two-inch-tall actor Richard Kiel) as one of the most memorable and indestructible Bond villains. Jaws is so tenacious, in fact, that Moore looks genuinely frightened, and that adds to the abundant fun. This time Bond teams up with yet another lovely Russian agent (Barbara Bach) to track a pair of nuclear submarines that the nefarious Stromberg (Curt J&#xFC;rgens) plans to use in his plot to start World War III. Featuring lavish sets designed by the great Ken Adam (Dr. Strangelove),The Spy Who Loved Meis a galaxy away from the suave Sean Connery exploits of the 1960s, but the film works perfectly as grandiose entertainment. From cavernous undersea lairs to the vast horizons of Egypt, this Bond thriller keeps its tongue firmly in cheek with a plot tailor-made for daredevil escapism. --Jeff ShannonLicense to Kill: Timothy Dalton's second and last shot at playing James Bond isn't nearly as much fun as his debut, two years earlier, in the 1987The Living Daylights. This time Bond gets mad after a close friend (David Hedison) from the intelligence sector is assassinated on his wedding day, and 007 goes undercover to link the murder to an international drug cartel. Robert Davi makes an interesting adversary, but as with most of the Bond films in the '70s, '80s, and '90s--and especially since the end of the cold war--one has to wonder why we should still care about these lesser villains and their unimaginative crimes. Still, Dalton did manage in his short time with the character to make 007 his own, which neither Roger Moore did nor Pierce Brosnan did. --Tom KeoghBeyondJames Bond Ultimate Collection - Vol. 2James Bond Ultimate Collection - Vol. 1James Bond Ultimate Edition - Vol. 3James Bond Ultimate Edition - Vol. 4Stills fromJames Bond Ultimate Collection - Vol. 2(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000BLFI", "B000ICM5V2", "B000ICM5VC", "B001PPLIEG", "B00AQSN7HE", "B00006BH8G", "B00004WEJZ", "B007REV4T8", "B0000BYRO7", "B0000BYRO9", "B00005JL0I", "B001CXYDO8", "B000M53GLS", "B000RPCK1U", "B000RPCK1K", "B001R10BN2", "B00003CXC5", "B000M53GM2", "B000BZISSU", "B004BR7XLM", "B000MGBLTQ", "B009RO9LKK", "B000NDEXPC", "B00003CX5P", "B000RPCK1A", "B00003CXCT", "B008YAPQX4", "B000E6ESEY", "B000P6XQ50", "B000FAGGWQ", "B00LC4PBQQ", "0756698375", "B000068OCS", "B000BCE8Q4", "B00005JLXH", "B007REV4YI", "B000NTPG70", "B000FKO3US", "B00DB97LRC", "B0024FAG1C", "B00003CXJ1", "B00008PC0Y", "B008LCRAC0", "B00004VVMZ", "B000063V8T", "B00006HBUJ", "B0024FAG1M", "B000059H9A", "B009A87Z6U", "B000NIBUR6", "B00005JNJV", "B002GSXKN8", "B009A87ZQU", "B0018PH3L0", "B0006Z2LMO", "B00005JL8F", "B000AOEMXM", "B00062IDDS", "B00BEZTMFY"], "bought_together": ["B00000BLFI", "B000ICM5V2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00000BLFI", "B000RPCK24", "B007REV4T8", "B000ICM5VC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 117388}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 49.25, "brand": "TCFHE/MGM", "asin": "B00000BCPF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5166P3S9ATL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "James Bond Ultimate Edition - Vol. 2 (A View to a Kill / Thunderball / Die Another Day / The Spy Who Loved Me / Licence to Kill)"}

{"description": "Considered by many to represent a low point in Steven Spielberg's  career,  1990'sAlwaysdid suggest something of a temporary drift in the  director's sensibility. A remake of the  classic Spencer Tracy filmA Guy Named Joe,Alwaysstars  Richard Dreyfuss as a Forest Service pilot who takes great risks with his own  life to douse wildfires from a plane. After promising his frightened fianc&eacute;e  (Holly Hunter) to keep his feet on the ground and go into teaching,  Dreyfuss's character is killed during one last flight. But his spirit wanders  restlessly, hopelessly attached to and possessive of Hunter, who can't see or  hear him. Then the real conflict begins: a trainee pilot (Brad Johnson), a  likable doofus, begins wooing a not-unappreciative Hunter--and it becomes  Dreyfuss's heavenly mandate to accept, and even assist in, their budding  romance. The trouble with the film is a certain airlessness, a  hyper-inventiveness in every scene and sequence that screams of Spielberg's self-education in Hollywood classicism. Unlike the masters he is constantly quoting and emulating inAlways, he forgets to back off and let the  movie breathe on its own sometimes, which would better serve his clockwork  orchestration of suspense and comedy elsewhere. Still, there are lovely  passages in this film, such as the unforgettable look on Dreyfuss's face a  half-second before fate claims him. John Goodman contributes good supporting  work, and Audrey Hepburn makes her final screen appearance as an angel.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002GHHHNI", "630471193X", "B00004W46I", "6305428352", "B00CVB6XZM", "B002GOAGZC", "B0045HCJ76", "0783230079", "B00AEFY4CG", "B000NA1WDQ", "B00028HBIE", "B0007ZEOD2", "B00008438W", "B002GHHHP6", "630542845X", "B000E1MXSW", "B0045HCIY0", "B000EHRVOW", "B004IK30KA", "B002GHHHPQ", "B000GI3RMY", "0783231032", "B003ASLJK4", "B00023P4QK", "B0039QPVRY", "B007JNR4WI", "B00005JMYC", "B005FQ2H8W", "0767818105", "B0045HCJRQ", "6305213283", "0783227396", "B00AEFXYOA", "B00005JL6M", "B00AEFYIH2", "B003L16F7C", "B00000IQV7", "B00000IQC2", "B002O3Z50G", "B004SIP8JI", "B002GHHHHO", "B001DB6J6Y", "B001R23GBU", "0783226810", "B000H6SXS8", "B00007GZR5", "B00AEFY7NM", "B002NZK5TQ", "B00347AIS0", "B000Y11BBW", "B00DDT0JB0", "B00003CXHG", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B00008G8M4", "B00005T7HZ", "B00D6I7IYY", "B00008PX7J", "6305428506", "6305236569", "B006TTC5B8", "B002O3Z4WU", "6305144168", "B0006FYOTC", "B00009NHC5", "0783225733", "B00006JU7S", "B00005KAQP", "B002GHHHKQ", "B001ECDVJU", "B00003CWU3", "B004KPLVYA", "B0002B15YM", "B0001CNRBG", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00000G3PA", "B000MQC9H4", "078322740X", "6305212112", "B0088XQC4O", "0788815466", "6305128952", "B00DNF1RM4", "B000765IJK", "B0009UZG3C", "B0000JBALO", "B0087ZG7NO"], "bought_together": ["B002GHHHNI", "B00004W46I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002GOAGZC", "B00004W46I", "630471193X", "B002GHHHNI"]}, "price": 6.66, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2309}, "asin": "B00000IQW5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FKVTBYN6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Always"}
{"description": "In 1969, five overeducated British comics and an American illustrator invaded the homes of unsuspecting BBC viewers with a brand of comedy that was, at the very least, odd. \"Absurd,\" \"bizarre,\" and \"incomprehensible\" are other descriptions that jump to mind. Nonetheless, this wacky sextet inaugurated an absurd tradition that continued through three-and-a-half seasons of half-hour TV episodes, a series of live performances, a handful of movies, and a legacy of dead parrots and upper-class twits.Monty Python's Flying Circus, Season 1features the first series of episodes foisted on a still-reeling public, introducing running gags (\"And now for something completely different\") and recurring characters (an armor-clad Terry Gilliam wielding a rubber chicken, Graham Chapman's pompous Colonel intruding on sketches he deems simply too silly, and of course Michael Palin's \"It's a Man\" wandered through the entire season). Among the sketch highlights are Nudge Nudge, the Funniest Joke in the World, How to Defend Yourself from a Man Attacking You with Fresh Fruit, Confuse a Cat, and The Dull Life of a City Stockbroker, all interspersed with various and sundry cut-out-animation sequences by Terry Gilliam. Also here are the Lumberjack Song, the Dead Parrot sketch, and the epic Science Fiction sketch (featuring the tennis-mad Blancmanges from outer space), and John Cleese announcing, \"And now for something completely different\" with all the authority of a BBC announcer who suddenly finds his news desk hijacked by mobsters. Some of these early episodes may lack the consistency and stream-of-consciousness flow of their later, more assured work, but they're packed with some of the most memorable moments of the group's brief but brilliant history. The Pythons hit their first-season stride in the middle episodes, in which clever sketches and strange and wonderful linking gags come together in a wierd logic, but if the final episodes of the series flag compared to their comic peak, their brand of comic madness infects every episode with moments of pure lunatic magic.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 539240}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "title": "Monty Python's Flying Circus, Season 1 [VHS]", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B0009XRZ92", "B00000JSJE", "B00008WQ9X", "B00000JSJF"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/718V7ZQ4STL._SY300_.gif", "asin": "B00000JMPG"}
{"description": "When Steven Spielberg was an adolescent, his first home movie was a backyard war film. When he toured Europe withDuelin his 20s, he saw old men crumble in front of headstones at Omaha Beach. That image became the opening scene ofSaving Private Ryan, his film of a mission following the D-day invasion that many have called the most realistic--and maybe the best--war film ever. With 1998 production standards, Spielberg has been able to create a stunning, unparalleled view of war as hell. We are at Omaha Beach as troops are slaughtered by Germans yet overcome the almost insurmountable odds.A stalwart Tom Hanks plays Captain Miller, a soldier's soldier, who takes a small band of troops behind enemy lines to retrieve a private whose three brothers have recently been killed in action. It's a public relations move for the Army, but it has historical precedent dating back to the Civil War. Some critics of the film have labeled the central characters stereotypes. If that is so, this movie gives stereotypes a good name: Tom Sizemore as the deft sergeant, Edward Burns as the hotheaded Private Reiben, Barry Pepper as the religious sniper, Adam Goldberg as the lone Jew, Vin Diesel as the oversize Private Caparzo, Giovanni Ribisi as the soulful medic, and Jeremy Davies, who as a meek corporal gives the film its most memorable performance.The movie is as heavy and realistic as Spielberg's Oscar-winningSchindler's List, but it's more kinetic. Spielberg and his ace technicians (the film won five Oscars: editing (Michael Kahn), cinematography (Janusz Kaminski), sound, sound effects, and directing) deliver battle sequences that wash over the eyes and hit the gut. The violence is extreme but never gratuitous. The final battle, a dizzying display of gusto, empathy, and chaos, leads to a profound repose.Saving Private Ryantouches us deeper thanSchindlerbecause it succinctly links the past with how we should feel today. It's the film Spielberg was destined to make.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006C7G9", "6303168507", "6303057225", "B00AEBBA36", "6302529441", "0800125762", "6304935811", "B00003CXTF", "B000EHSVS2", "0790734060", "6303257844", "6302415853", "B0007TKNGA", "6301247345", "6301662954", "0790734079", "6302610702", "6302909023", "630407185X", "0783221347", "079213690X", "0800132009", "0790701251", "6305363668", "6301115430", "0790752395", "6304071876", "6300268748"], "bought_together": ["B00006C7G9"], "also_viewed": ["0792151712", "6301792734", "0792837614", "B00003CXXO", "6303109950", "6304117752", "6303402348", "6303168507", "B00003CXTF", "B000RC7QVC", "0783221347", "078323662X", "630018627X", "6304151306", "0783230095", "6304233639", "B0000040EJ", "6303187064"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 269908}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.5, "brand": "", "asin": "B00000K3AM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4143F912CXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Saving Private Ryan [VHS]"}

{"description": "Comparisons toThe Blair Witch Projectare inevitable for the inventive, satiricalThe Last Broadcast, a chilling and funny mockumentary by filmmakers Stefan Avalos and Lance Weiler. Besides being made and coming to prominence around the same time (though without aBlair Witch-style marketing juggernaut),The Last Broadcastalso details the doomed travails of some amateur filmmakers as they track a mysterious, murderous legend in a dark forest. Hmmm, sound familiar? Actually,The Last Broadcasttakes a different tack on this premise, one more media-savvy thanBlair Witch. Turns out that this is the latest installment of theX-Files-ish public access showFact or Fiction, and its doofusy hosts (Avalos and Weiler themselves) plan on doing a live broadcast from deep in the New Jersey woods on their ongoing quest for the Bigfoot-like Jersey Devil. Teaming up with two Internet-based fans, they plunge themselves and their equipment into the wintry woods; only one man, the creepy psychic Jim (Jim Seward), returns, and is promptly convicted of the murders of the other three. While it does boast footage made by the \"dead\" filmmakers,The Last Broadcastis more formally structured as a documentary, complete with officious, muckraking host (David Leigh) and much behind-the-scenes footage. We're let in on the backgrounds of the victims, the 911 phone calls, the murder trial, the inconsistencies the prosecution overlooked, and the painstaking work of reconstructing the film stock, which may unlock the mystery of the true killer. Filmed entirely with digital cameras and assembled on digital systems for a mind-boggling $900,The Last Broadcastboasts a great look and a sharp, satiric eye for sending up the media--Avalos and Weiler are in calm command of their medium and message. The film does take a sharp turn that could either enrage or amaze viewers enraptured by what's preceded, but it's a minor quibble at best. And unlikeThe Blair Witch Project,The Last Broadcastdoes answer all the mysterious questions it raises.--Mark Englehart", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 622788}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.96, "brand": "", "asin": "B00001WY85", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EVVR863XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Last Broadcast [VHS]"}
{"description": "So who exactly was Deep Throat, that all-important source who helped Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein bust open the Watergate scandal? Well, according to this thoroughly funny, keenly smart comedy from director Andrew Fleming (The Craft), it was two sweetly daft teenage girls named Betsy and Arlene. Taking the history and figures from Watergate and running gleefully and sacrilegiously amok,Dickoffers up a hilarious what-if scenario that takes the Nixon administration's downfall from grave tragedy to hilarious farce. When Betsy (Kirsten Dunst) and Arlene (Michelle Williams) run into a shady figure in the stairwell of Arlene's Watergate apartment building, little do they know they've stumbled upon G.&nbsp;Gordon Liddy (Harry Shearer) on the night of the Democratic National Headquarters break-in. Later, on a White House field trip, they wind up meeting with Nixon himself (Dan Hedaya), who, to ensure their silence, decides to make them official White House dog walkers and \"secret youth advisors.\" Of course, Betsy and Arlene soon find out their idol has feet of clay, and ultimately decide to aid \"radical muckraking journalists\" (and queasy rivals) Woodward (Will Ferrell) and Bernstein (Bruce McCullough) in their investigation. Fleming and cowriter Sheryl Longin's enfolding of the Watergate scandal is extremely clever and inspired, from Arlene's 18-and-a-half-minute declaration of love on Nixon's tape recorder to the Hello Dolly cookies (laced with a certain herbal stimulant) that help bring about the U.S.-Soviet accord. And after all the angsty-serious portraits of Watergate, it's bliss to see the prime players sent up mercilessly; in addition to Shearer, the cast boasts Dave Foley (Erlichman), Jim Breuer (John Dean), Saul Rubinek (Kissinger), and Ana Gasteyer (Rosemary Woods), all in fine form. Hedaya's Nixon, dead-on but never parodic, is an Oscar-worthy comic turn, and Dunst and Williams invest their characters with affection and humor; the success of the film lies in the way these talented actresses make us laughwithBetsy and Arlene, never at them. Don't be put off by the teen sheen on this comedy--it's also for all of us who still remember Watergate even after 25 years, and still love dancing on the scandal's grave.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303057942"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 509409}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.95, "brand": "", "asin": "B000021Y7C", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517TQG3CXVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dick [VHS]"}
{"description": "It's difficult to create a film that's fast paced, exciting, and aesthetically appealing without diluting its dialogue.Run Lola Run, directed and written by Tom Tykwer, is an enchanting balance of pace and narrative, creating a universal parable that leaps over cultural barriers. This is the story of young Lola (Franka Potente) and her boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu). In the space of 20&nbsp;minutes, they must come up with 100,000&nbsp;deutsche marks to pay back a seedy gangster, who will be less than forgiving when he finds out that Manni incompetently lost his cash to an opportunistic vagrant. Lola, confronted with one obstacle after another, rides an emotional roller coaster in her high-speed efforts to help the hapless Manni--attempting to extract the cash first from her double-dealing father (appropriately a bank manager), and then by any means necessary. From this point nothing goes right for either protagonist, but just when you think you've figured out the movie, the director introduces a series of brilliant existential twists that boggle the mind. Tykwer uses rapid camera movements and innovative pauses to explore the theme of cause and effect. Accompanied by a pulse-poundingsoundtrack, we follow Lola through every turn and every heartbreak as she and Manni rush forward on a collision course with fate. There were a variety of original and intelligent films released in 1999, but perhaps none were as witty and clever as this little gem--one of the best foreign films of the year.--Jeremy Storey", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 496767}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.74, "brand": "", "asin": "B000021Y74", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KYAD2YAVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Run Lola Run [VHS]"}
{"description": "With a voracious trio of mako sharks wreaking havoc,Deep Blue  Seadares to up the ante onJaws, but director Renny Harlin trades the nuanced suspense of Spielberg's 1975 blockbuster for the trickery of the digital age. In other words, why build genuine terror when you can show ill-fated humans getting torn into bloody chunks? The aforementioned makos have been lab rats in an effort to harvest a miracle cure for Alzheimer's disease from the brains of sharks, but the research has an unfortunate side effect: the sharks get smarter, and they're determined to break out of Aquatica, the deep-sea complex where they've been penned.Model-actress Saffron Burrows plays the researcher; Thomas Jane pulls double-duty as shark expert and action hunk; Samuel&nbsp;L. Jackson's the corporate sponsor who chooses theworsttime for an Aquatica tour; and rapper LL&nbsp;Cool&nbsp;J is nicely cast as Aquatica's cook and comic  relief. Michael Rapaport, Jacqueline McKenzie, and Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd round out the cast, most of whom are turned into shark food as the makos turn Aquatica into a floating junkyard. Harlin takes devilish pleasure in providing sudden, unexpected shocks--no small feat in such a derivative thriller--and  as a series of action set-pieces,Deep Blue Seanever disappoints. It's inevitable that Burrows should end up in her underwear like Sigourney Weaver inAlien, but even then the movie offers a credible reason for the strip-down; thatDeep Blue Seacan be simultaneously ridiculous and sensible is just another one of its shlocky charms.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B008DL4LQ2", "0767802497", "B00008WFU5", "B0006HBZYC", "B00008WFU4", "B00005A8XX", "6305090564", "B004USUP58", "B003VA3JUO", "B000WTVZGC", "B002NZK5U0", "B00AEFYXQI", "6305943133", "B007STBUHI", "B003ZZ7TPG", "0783225547", "B001YYQ9S8", "B00153ZR8G", "B00AIZ2FPK", "B00005O5B5", "B00064X5L6", "B00064AE0G", "B00AEFYSR2", "B000JBXHQY", "B0002V7OI8", "B00E8G5HQE", "B005CHV14A", "B004FHCHAU", "B00018D3UU", "B00DCLTA6Y", "B000BNX3BE", "B003ABZG14", "B003954IV0", "B00BTYNXJG", "B000NVT0TI", "0767817478", "B000N4RAS8", "B000ASATZ8", "B00000IQC4", "B001DSNEK6", "B00000IQVQ", "B00000G3PA", "B004K4FUVQ", "B00008G8M4", "B002O3Z50G", "0783237413", "B00004STDN", "B004XVMCN0", "B002ZG98LO", "0792839684", "B00005UQ9W", "B000PFU83O", "B0010X73ZG", "B00013RC7K", "B00AEFXPMG", "B004LWZW6K", "B00005JOWW", "B00003L9CQ", "B004AC6PV2", "B0002W4SBI", "B000WTVZGW", "B003UN0752", "B0002IQMAM", "B00005JM5B", "B00BNAE14W", "B00AEFXPSK", "B004P7CN7W", "B000X0GWNG", "B00005RYKU", "B00004Z4WR", "0767824954", "B000BUNZY2", "B00008G8LY", "B00317LM8S", "B00111YM56", "B00003CXKA", "B00600SOXE", "B00005JMXX", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B00005JMZK", "6304806434", "B0045HCJ0S", "B00BTYOYG2", "B000AM4P9K", "B004W7D1G2", "B00AEFYV9W", "B002ZG98KK", "B0001FR3IQ", "B00009WVSL", "B0057RCFQS", "B004EPZ08O", "B00003CXO1", "B000CSUNLG", "B003PIUINS", "B001ECDVKE", "B00111YM5Q", "B00IS6WQ5K", "B0021L8UXA", "B00003CXUP"], "bought_together": ["B00008WFU5", "B00008WFU4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0767802497", "B00008WFU4", "B008DL4LQ2", "B00004TDTO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 122500}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.55, "brand": "JACKSON,SAMUEL L.", "asin": "B00002E233", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71TDBGEC1NL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Deep Blue Sea"}

{"description": "Mounted in high lavish style, from the opening strains to coda,The Red Violinpays homage to the careful uses of color and composition without bothering to support these qualities with any real substance. Oh, it's a class act on the surface all the way, while failing on nearly every other level to convince. The story tells the story, revealing precious little else. The 17th-century Cremonese instrument-maker Niccolo  Bussotti finishes his final violin with a curious red varnish, the secret of which spans the film, yet will come as a surprise only to the very sleepy. The odd voyage of this unique violin through history is then explored from one episode to the next, from child prodigy to gypsies to Victorian virtuoso to a clandestine enclave of art lovers in Shanghai during the Cultural Revolution. This is all framed by  the violin's rediscovery in present day by instrument appraiser Charles Morritz (Samuel&nbsp;L. Jackson), for whom the perfect instrument strikes a resonant chord. The main scheme of the film, an object connecting a number of seemingly disparate stories, has been used many times, most notably in Max Ophuls'sLa Ronde. But while this approach is employed elsewhere to cause one scene to reverberate against another,The Red Violinis content to leave each episode thematically unconnected with any of the others. On the decorative level, the film may satisfy many viewers with its sensuous attention to tone and detail, as well as its eclectic and expertly  performedscore. But as  narrative it is very slight. Just pierce the pretty crust of this puff pastry and gaze in wonder at the pocket of air within.--Jim Gay", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 93392}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "The Red Violin", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000K3TN", "6304712936", "B00860YICC", "B0064MT1FI", "B00031TXC2", "B00000J28V", "B007T40GL8", "B004SIP7F8", "B0034PHWFO", "B000HDRANK", "B00005JKGK", "0780619587", "B004SIP6BI", "B000FVQLRA", "B00166UFA2", "B000QUCNOK", "B0010VQRGO", "B002M2T1VI", "B000MV8AE0", "B000GG4Y32", "B00005UJYA", "B00AZMFO6I", "B00AZ43C4M", "B0001US61O", "B00005MEOU", "B004YCKJNI", "B004SIP8W0", "B002VWNIAY", "B004SIP9U6", "B00B0U2SFE", "B000000XBT", "B000HDRANA", "B00003CX8N", "B000H7JD1I", "B00002RAPT", "B00006RCO2", "B000CSUNRU", "1573623903", "B00005O06J", "B00006ZXSI", "B0042ZEEI8", "B00000IQC0", "B00AEBB9UK", "B000NDIAXI", "B00005JPX8", "B000BYA4II", "B004SIPAJG", "B004SEUIXS", "B0087IT8FK", "B00003CXC9", "6305767866", "B00AATV07S", "B000Q66Q10", "B005CFBZ3O", "B00366E07E", "B00003CY5A", "B00G15MDI0", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B004SIP7D0", "B0002V7S34", "B000BITVAG", "B0082SICCU", "B00005JLRE", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B00133KFGW", "B004SIP6QI", "B004SUDQ2W", "B003AWRMCY", "B00003CXXG", "B00824FK9W", "B0001DCYUU", "0783240325", "B002O3Z4WU", "B00FF9SKQW", "B00011D1OU", "B00005JMOW", "B000U2U0E4", "B00002E20R", "B002BWP4A6", "B0002J58HO", "B00005O06M", "B002GTZSZU", "B000F5FMFS", "B000EHRVOW", "B00AEBB8SS", "B00003CX9W", "6304907729", "B00JAGF9E2", "B0050FXDDQ", "B000RF7XYO", "0767802519", "B00006RCO3", "B00005JO4D", "B001EOQCMG", "B0007QJ210", "B00067BBLY", "B00005LK94", "B0000639EW", "0792844874", "6305144168"], "buy_after_viewing": ["6304712936", "B00000K3TN", "B0064MT1FI", "B00031TXC2"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519PEFGQV5L._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "B000031WD7"}
{"description": "After viewingSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote to Walt Disney about adapting his novel of an ape-man into a feature animated cartoon. Sixtysome years later, the tale is finally told with brilliant design work that looks unlike any previous animated film. The story is a natural for Disney since the themes of misunderstood central figures have been at the heart of its recent hits. Disney'sTarzandoesn't wander far from the familiar story of a shipwrecked baby who is brought up by apes in Africa. What gives the film its zing is its clever use of music (the songs are sung by Phil Collins himself rather than onscreen characters) and the remarkable animation. Deep Canvas, a 3-D technology, was developed for the film, creating a jungle that comes alive as Tarzan swings through the trees, often looking like a modern skateboarder racing down giant tree limbs. The usual foray of sidekicks, including a rambunctious ape voiced by Rosie O'Donnell, should keep the little ones aptly entertained. The two lead voices, Tony Goldwyn as Tarzan and Minnie Driver as Jane, are inspired choices. Their chemistry helps the story through the weakest points (the last third) and makes Tarzan's initial connection with all things human (including Jane) delicious entertainment. Disney still is not taking risks in its animated films, but as cookie-cutter entertainment,Tarzanmakes a pretty good treat.

{"description": "As revisionist history, Michael Mann's intelligent docudramaThe Insideris a simmering brew of altered facts and dramatic license. In a broader perspective, however, the film (cowritten withForrest GumpOscar-winner Eric Roth) is effectively accurate as an engrossing study of ethics in the corruptible industries of tobacco and broadcast journalism. On one side, there is Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe), the former tobacco scientist who violated contractual agreements to expose Brown & Williamson's inclusion of addictive ingredients in cigarettes, casting himself into a vortex of moral dilemma. On the other side is60&nbsp;Minutesproducer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), whose struggle to report Wigand's story puts him at odds with veteran correspondent Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer) and senior executives at CBS News.As the urgency of the story increases, so does the film's palpable sense of paranoia, inviting favorable comparison toAll the President's Men. While Pacino downplays the theatrical excess that plagued him in previous roles, Crow is superb as a man who retains his tortured integrity at great personal cost.The Insideris two movies--a cover-up thriller and a drama about journalistic ethics--that combine to embrace the noble values personified by Wigand and Bergman. Even if the details aren't always precise (as Mike Wallace and others protested prior to the film's release), the film adheres to a higher truth that was so blatantly violated by tobacco executives seen in an oft-repeated video clip, lying under oath in the service of greed.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002DU39GW", "B00005BCKF", "0470499052", "0314277447", "B0002XNT12", "0314904573", "B0038Z5T4Q", "074945332X", "B00337KM2S", "B003L20IG0", "630542828X", "0205667503", "B001N44BVQ", "B000H0MKOC", "B000CNESTE", "B00121QGPY", "B00441GYPG", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00004YA78", "B0001HLVS2", "B00BTYOYG2", "B000CEXEWA", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005JKG9", "B00AEFXYJA", "B000085OXZ", "B00BB67UNW", "B0035JHYGQ", "B00003CXFV", "B00004Y7Y4", "B00005JLX2", "B00AEBB95K", "B000XR9L50", "B000LXHK2C", "B000CNESU8", "B00441GYOM", "B00003CWUX", "B00A2H9VKG", "B002VWNICC", "B001AS32QK", "B000059TFO", "0780622561", "B002CPMB9O", "B0000296JH", "007337959X", "B000ARTN3I", "B002O3Z4WU", "B004SIP6C2", "B0000AM6JI", "B000OYAT3U", "B005FITIGO", "B00005JKMQ", "B0034G4P7G", "0792838947", "B00008CMRK", "B00003CXP7", "B000CQLZ8S", "B00004Z1FL", "B0001907AI", "B004SUDQ1S", "B00CLH0848", "0767817710", "B00007G1YQ", "B00008R9KG", "B000C3L2IO", "B0031OCY2E", "B00127RAGC", "B003U0AHBO", "B00JBGSHSQ", "B004IFYMWK", "B00004XPPB", "B0009OUBC4", "B004U7MR1Y", "B00008BNTD", "B001EJW0SG", "0783226845", "B003LR5BD0", "6304696507", "B0001I56FA", "B00DDY45DI", "B00GUO2SKA", "B0000YEEGM", "B000HT38IK", "B00006RCNV", "B000UGBOT0", "B000A9QK5K", "B000A9QK6E", "B00IJS2OHM", "B006DHATE6", "B0002J4X2K", "B000MXPE7O", "B004SIP7TE", "6305428115", "B00BLF9FYA", "B00AEBB9EG", "B0036TGSR6", "0783229402", "B00005BCK9", "B00004RE27"], "bought_together": ["B002DU39GW", "B003L20IG0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002DU39GW", "B000Y11B8U", "B003L20IG0", "B00005JN2Z"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17334}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.75, "brand": "Disney", "asin": "B00003CWRX", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y28RGA5AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Insider"}
{"description": "As the triumphant start of a trilogy,The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ringleaves you begging for more. By necessity, Peter  Jackson's ambitious epic compresses J.R.R. Tolkien's classicThe Lord of the Rings,  but this robust adaptation maintains reverent allegiance to Tolkien's creation,  instantly qualifying as one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. At 178  minutes, it's long enough to establish the myriad inhabitants of Middle-earth,  the legendary Rings of Power, and the fellowship of hobbits, elves, dwarves, and  humans--led by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the brave hobbit Frodo  (Elijah Wood)--who must battle terrifying forces of evil on their perilous  journey to destroy the One Ring in the land of Mordor. Superbly paced, the film  is both epic and intimate, offering astonishing special effects and production  design while emphasizing the emotional intensity of Frodo's adventure. Ending on  a perfect note of heroic loyalty and rich anticipation, this wondrous fantasy  continues inThe Two Towers(2002).--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B005COPWZW", "B00005JM5E", "B002ZG980U", "B002PMV9FG", "B001GZ6QC4", "B007K3JFUQ", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JNJV", "B001OQCV6A", "B004M1A21K", "B008UZ7MYY", "B00HFFE8HE", "B000A9QKLO", "B000E8M0VA", "B000W7F5SS", "B0014C2FX8", "0618640150", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00003CX5P", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00005QZWI", "B0019L770A", "B000I0RQVI", "B002IPFWTE", "B001CDR1FG", "B0006UEVT0", "B003TT2X6S", "B001OQCV2E", "B009JBWOU0", "B00005JL78", "B00005JNOG", "B001UV4XHY", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B00GKOJ98E", "0345325818", "B0014Z4ON4", "B000H30B2C", "B005LXQLRW", "B001UV4XIS", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00CZDLGDU", "0345538374", "B004LWZW42", "B007REV4T8", "B000W746GK", "B00005JPH2", "B003TT2X72", "B004LWZWGA", "B0087ZG7J8", "B005G4TJUC", "B003ZK99NQ", "B00006HBUJ", "B008UZA8FY", "B0090SI56Y", "B000VI70QS", "B00005JNC2", "B004WCTLNY", "B0014Z4OMU", "6305313687", "B004AKCME8", "B000E6EK2Y", "0547928211", "B000LC55F2", "B0002KVUKM", "B000FQJAIW", "B008JFUO72", "B000FIMG68", "B005LAIHSG", "B005LAIIT4", "B004AOECXI", "B00029RTCG", "B000P0J0EM", "B002HWRYJE", "B0060FXDCG", "B001ECQ75A", "0792839749", "B00AEFXZJE", "B005LAII0I", "B0042U94UQ", "B001HN6918", "B00008G8M5", "B008JFURII", "B003ZKBELG", "B000P0J09W", "B003XURDAY", "B00335EQ0E", "B00008G8M4", "0547928203", "B000W796OM", "B00006ADD5", "B00J49R1BY", "B00B04NIZO", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00001ZWUS"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HFFE8HE", "B00005JKZY", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00005JKZV"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3641}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.49, "brand": "NEW Line Home Video", "asin": "B00003CWT6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Dj%2BQ1hLBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)"}
{"description": "If you want to see James Van Der Beek and Ashton Kutcher decked out in cowboy hats and leather chaps,Texas Rangersis the movie for you. Van Der Beek is a young recruit out to avenge his family, who were shot down by bandits; Dylan McDermott is the loose cannon commander of the Texas Rangers unit that's out to track those bandits down. Along for the ride are Kutcher, Usher Raymond, Robert Patrick, Randy Travis, and a host of other good-looking young actors. Rachael Leigh Cook provides some assurance that everything is appropriately heterosexual, though a scene in which Kutcher jumps into a washtub with Van Der Beek may raise some eyebrows. Head bandit Alfred Molina grins with nonchalance as his men gun down innocent bystanders. No one in the cast even attempts to speak with a credible Texas accent, but everyone's hair is exquisitely mussed.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005QW6V", "B002NALPBS", "B003B56ID4", "B001AR0D54", "B006LL3W0W", "B00EU8RBXW", "B00BAXTY7G", "B00F3TDA6O", "B002JHDBUS", "B00575GYUI", "B0007R8E54", "B000E5N6LG", "B0013D8L8Q", "B007PXYWNQ", "B0006GAO4A", "B0016MJ6JW", "B003VBR5YO", "B0083JEE1G", "B00008IHAW", "6305504024", "B006OALDLA", "B004NJC0U2", "B001B187MU", "B001U1RM40", "B00JA3RVG4", "B00195I3OK", "B00368PSKU", "B0000TANUI", "B0080QOK16", "B00368PSKK", "B00A92MD8G", "B0000694Y3", "B00EKU179E", "B003NF97MQ", "B0007OY2OO", "B000EOTUSA", "B000056H2J", "B004KDYQYY", "B001LRJH0U", "B005NGKMOU", "B009OE2O1Q", "B0007OY2NA", "B001GD6VT4", "B00116GEJS", "B009OE2O7A", "B009ERK2UI", "B0002DRDBY", "B002O3Z4XE", "B0056OZI20", "B00003CXIV", "B000MEYJHY", "B009INAI02", "B000BNTM9G", "B000V5EYXS", "B0081FSMPG", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B000GFRI4K", "B0038EGD3I", "B00991151O", "B005DEUER2", "B00AEFXUL2", "B00B999F2U", "B00AFEY7RI", "B0000C2IR4", "B0002235KI", "B000TGJ82Q", "B00AEFYPHA", "0783229631", "B001KO1BCQ", "B005Z9MFWC", "B00515J6RW", "B0001Z3I0I", "6305245460", "078322592X", "B002U4UYZK", "6304711905", "B0007MANYY", "B000059H7K", "B00DZFKNFO", "B00402FGH6", "B000P0I4O4", "B001LMAK88", "B000KF0GWW", "B004U7MQWY", "B004XWGZK0", "B00AEFXFW6", "B0074JOCTU", "B00008PC19", "B0055SJY86", "B0007MANZI", "B0002J4X2K", "B003ASLJRC", "B000G6N0HI", "B0018PH3L0", "B00004WG2F", "B0007OY2OE", "B000F6IODE", "B00BXTDVEO", "B00JLDT9UE", "B003VA3JZO"], "bought_together": ["B00005QW6V"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005QW6V", "B002NALPBS", "B008D1RDH6", "B003B56ID4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 164914}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.1, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXKP", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VA3WB2TCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Texas Rangers"}

{"description": "The Replacementsmanages to be both completely formulaic and yet immensely enjoyable. When a professional football players' strike happens, the owner of a fictitious team, the Washington Sentinels, commissions maverick coach Jimmy McGinty (Gene Hackman) to pull together a team. McGinty selects a collection of talented oddballs--a Welsh soccer player, a sumo wrestler, a couple of professional bodyguards--with athletic pasts, figuring that if it doesn't work out as a game, it might as well be a circus. To lead the team, he finds Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves), a once-promising player who had a disastrous championship game. Naturally, despite squabbling and bickering, a roguish camaraderie develops through a mixture of racial infighting, harassment from the striking professionals, and a big bar brawl--after which they're all thrown in jail and perform the most improbable impromptu dance number ever committed to film. The mixture of cheerfully clich&eacute; plot mechanics, an engaging collection of supporting actors (including Orlando Jones, Rhys Ifans fromNotting Hill, and Jon Favreau fromSwingers), and sheer ridiculousness somehow combines to makeThe Replacementscompletely entertaining. Reeves is somehow turning into a pleasant leading man; he even emotes convincingly in this movie. And let's face it, Gene Hackman is quite possibly the greatest actor alive, able to speak the trashiest dialogue with fierce conviction. Plus, just to prove that the tight pants and close huddles of football are heterosexual, there are many, many shots of cheerleaders going through stripper-inspired routines.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00E1HIXFW", "B002NZK5QO", "6305428492", "B000J3OTT6", "B000056VP4", "B00AEFYJI0", "B00AEFYKWU", "B000FOPPDI", "B000NTMA0Q", "B0006GANOQ", "B000F6ZIIS", "B00005JPBO", "B00AEBB9UU", "B00005JNEW", "B000A0GP0Y", "B00005JKE4", "B00E8G5HZ0", "B000KHYN9C", "0792843592", "B001SGEUYW", "B00004W221", "B00AEFXJY0", "B002GIBVWA", "B000FVR1T2", "B001Q8MMBK", "B002VECM6S", "0780627849", "B00BTYNXJG", "B0009MDPYM", "630529142X", "B00005QW6W", "B00003CXND", "B004OBQDHK", "B004KPLVX6", "B002K0WBXW", "B000HEWEE4", "B00014NEZI", "B00005M20J", "0800177258", "B001BP4K22", "0767802454", "6305428530", "B004GJYRF0", "B00005JL93", "B000053VAX", "B00000F4ZY", "B000CCBCAI", "B0000B1OFL", "B00026ZD04", "6304712499", "6305428077", "B00000G3PA", "B000GAKDAG", "0767817710", "B00DW5IL92", "B002U4UYYQ", "6304711891", "B000U1ZV8A", "B00008L3W3", "6305213283", "0783228465", "B003AWRMBA", "B00FEHCQEC", "B008R65XTC", "B004BFTFBU", "B0047685IC", "0767817729", "B000QUCRB4", "B0026BXHPG", "B00000JGPE", "6305428387", "B0007DAGZ4", "B004KPLVWM", "6305428115", "B00AEBB86A", "6304806434", "6305262128", "078324021X", "B0000524E5", "6305065551", "B0006GAI5U", "B0001US66Y", "0767821513", "B0009X76ZK", "B000EXZFCQ", "B002GOAH1A", "B00AEFYDM2", "B00007E2F5", "B000A343RI", "B00AEFYIH2", "6305133468", "B00AEBB86U", "0783225741", "B000069HQ2", "B00005A3KS", "B002AT8KD8", "B000YGGNMO", "B007STBUHI", "B000089778", "B000ELJAEM"], "bought_together": ["B00E1HIXFW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00B83N2NU", "B000MNOX94", "B00005JKE4", "0790749912"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 62076}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.99, "brand": "Team Marketing", "asin": "B00003CXLV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513B1VE3PSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Replacements (Snap Case)"}

{"description": "If you want to laugh and enjoy yourself, I recommend Bring It On. With a superb cast, catchy lines, and a fully developed plot, this movie is great! Kirsten Dunst stars as Torrance Shipman, the ditzy but loveable high school senior who is newly elected team captain of her high school cheerleading team. But when a replacement cheerleader, Missy Pantone, walks in to the Toros' cheerleading squad (hilariously portrayed by Eliza Dushku), she shows Torrance that the team's cheers are ripped off from the East Compton Clovers, and you can believe that the Clovers are fed up with the stealing. Torrance, horrified that her cheerleading career has been a fake, makes an effort to be original, but the result is a humiliating performance at a competition. Torrance is comforted by love interest Cliff Pantone (played by hottie Jesse Bradford), Missy's REALLY cute twin brother, and a romance begins. As the movie leads up to the UCA Nationals competition, the Clovers and Toros fight for the win. Who will it be? Well you better watch it for yourself. Bring It On is a refreshing change from the immature sick sex movies and it instead is fresh, bright, witty, and very funny.

{"description": "Shot in the rough, 16-millimeter style of a low-budget documentary,Tigerlandmarked director Joel Schumacher's welcomed return to simplicity after a slew of bloated blockbusters likeBatman & Robin. In revitalizing Schumacher's directorial talent,Tigerland--partially inspired by the Danish Dogme 95 movement of no-frills filmmaking--suggested that one solution to Hollywood's moribund \"product\" was to abandon excess, focus on essentials, and assemble a fine cast of unknown actors to make it all worthwhile. To that end,Tigerlandalso marked the deserving arrival of Irish actor Colin Farrell as Hollywood's hottest new discovery.Its story never leaves U.S. soil, soTigerlanddiffers from such in-country Vietnam films asPlatoonandFull Metal Jacket. Instead, it's about the anxieties and moral dilemmas that arise from theanticipationof death and killing. These roiling emotions are focused on the character of Private Bozz (Farrell), whose insubordination betrays a singular knack for leadership during infantry training at Fort Polk, Louisiana, in 1971. Part R.P. McMurphy and part Cool Hand Luke, Bozz is a defiant maverick, barely tolerated by his superiors, challenged or revered by his fellow grunts, and ultimately honed into a soldier of remarkable promise. An intense final week in the live-ammo training ground nicknamed \"Tigerland\" galvanizes the platoon and Bozz's place in it, and although the film (partially based on cowriter Ross Klavan's own experience) lacks the emotional impact ofPlatoon, it deals quite potently with the internal conflicts that must be waged before external warfare can be endured.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003M987QK", "B000FIHN5M", "B0002Y4PPK", "B00005JLX2", "B00005JKTP", "B00005JLQN", "B001MZ5W3M", "B004C45AZU", "B006ISJQ26", "B0015D20FE", "B000MGB6NM", "B003LL3FIY", "B0013D8LC2", "B0018BD9DA", "B000J4QWMC", "B0002V7SOS", "B00005QW6V", "B00AEBBA36", "B000P0J09C", "B00008EYA5", "B000ELL1R6", "B003Y5H5FG", "B00005PJ8L", "B003ELKNH2", "079284646X", "B00AEBB86U", "B000DZIGDU", "B00005PJ8T", "B00005JK8K", "B00AEFY4IA", "1558908315", "B000N3SRO0", "B004SUDQCM", "B001BNFRB2", "B00I6JODGO", "B00CLH09UQ", "B00096S4BM", "B00003CXHJ", "B00005JKQS", "B00001ZWUS", "B000MRA542", "B00JA3RVG4", "B00009RDG9", "B00005PJ8K", "B0001NBMGC", "B00AEFXVCU", "B006TTC5HC", "B003M987AQ", "B00000F2UF", "B00096S4BW", "B00004WG2F", "B00005JA9F", "B00HOGBXS6", "B000R9U3B0", "B0001NBMHQ", "B004P7CMVE", "B002ZG97RE", "B00275EGWY", "B0045HCJ0S", "B00005BJWC", "B007REV4LQ", "6304711905", "B0007TKNLA", "B00001U0DU", "B000095WW8", "B000R4SMCW", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00AMSQBTY", "B00005JL78", "B00004ZBVG", "B000BRP4BM", "B00AEFYENK", "B004TPJN3C", "B000065U1N", "B00005BCKG", "B008JFUN50", "B00IKM5OCO", "B00J11U54K", "0792841662", "B00H1RMWYW", "B00096S4DA", "B000XR9L50", "B001ULAUF8", "B00004RF82", "B00005QBZA", "6304765258", "B005LAIIRQ", "B0001FVDIC", "B001AZW73M", "B000WMA6R8", "0792844017", "B003BV8ID6", "B00005BCKF", "B007S0DCUU", "B0008ENHTY", "B00004STDN", "B00003CXQG", "6304806434", "B004ZJZQGA", "B004P7CMOQ"], "bought_together": ["B003M987QK", "B000FIHN5M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0006HBZXS", "B004U7MQWY", "B00005JKTP", "0783222149"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 39744}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.66, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00003CXOY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41K9ZC8W0ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tigerland"}

{"description": "When Randy the video geek rattles off the rules of surviving a horror  movie in Wes Craven'sScream, he speaks for a generation of filmgoers  who are all too aware of slasher movie clich&eacute;s. Playfully scripted by  Kevin Williamson with a self-aware wink and more than a few nods to its  grandfathers (fromPsychotoHalloweento theFriday the  13thdynasty),Screamskewers teen horror conventions with loving  reverence while re-creating them in a modern, movie-savvy context. And so  goes the series, which continues the satirical spoofing by tackling (what  else?) sequels while sustaining its own self-contained mythology. Catty  reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) turns grisly murders into lurid  bestsellers, a cult of killer wannabes continues to hunt spunky  psycho-survivor Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell) for their 15 minutes of fame, and a  cheesy movie series (Stab) develops within the movie series.Screamremains the high point of the series--a fresh take on a genre  long since collapsed into routine, butScream&nbsp;2spoofs itself  with witty humor (\"Why would anyone want to do that? Sequels suck!\" opines  college film student Randy), and delights with more elaborate set pieces and  all-new rules for surviving a horror movie sequel. The endangered veterans of  the original film reunite one last time forScream&nbsp;3, which plays  out on the movie set ofStab&nbsp;3. (It's a trilogy within a  trilogy!) With Williamson gone, replacement screenwriter Ehran Kruger tries  to mine the formula one more time. It's a little tired by now, and pale  imitations (Urban Legend,I Know What You Did Last Summer) have  further drained the zeitgeist, but the film bubbles with bright humor, and  director Craven is stylistically at the top of his game. As a trilogy, it  remains both the most consistently entertaining and self-aware horror series  ever made.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004LWZW2O", "B000A5045Q", "B003PIUINS", "B000RIWAVW", "B000FSME9W", "B008MXMFVE", "B004EPZ08O", "B000FA57UI", "B005CFC0N8", "6305300801", "6305017115", "B000FA57US", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B001DJLD1W", "B00005LC4Q", "B000RJUZOA", "B004AC6PMG", "0767824954", "B000Q66Q2O", "B001B1UO6W", "B004LWZW2Y", "B00AEFYYH6", "B004P7CN7W", "B004SIP9E2", "B0033B5XCS", "B002ZG99IG", "B004P7CNUY", "B0009MWEM6", "B000FOQ1KY", "B001NPD9LS", "B000VKL6Z2", "B0002JP572", "B004TI35YC", "B001DJLD0S", "B000V4UFZK", "B004P7CM9Q", "B00DTPRZ24", "B0009X763M", "B002R3G912", "B000FC2HS6", "B00CAATSME", "B00018D42W", "B001JFZ1UE", "B00AEFY37C", "B003Q6D27S", "B002AS45YM", "B0000CEB6Y", "B0000541TL", "B00441GYVK", "B000FWHW86", "B002ZG971U", "B0006SGYL0", "B000GETUDI", "B004LWZW24", "B003UGLCIA", "B003UN0752", "B00005A8XX", "B00275EHFU", "B005GT3X68", "B000EHRVP6", "B001AV3BWM", "B00006FI0R", "B00DTPRZ10", "B0053TWVDC", "B000083C6I", "B00008WFU4", "B00BM4Q4H6", "B00006FDCD", "B002G1WPI6", "B002YICNE2", "B008JFUNYG", "B00009PY4G", "B0000VCZMK", "B004AC6PV2", "B000FS9FE4", "B00004W4UD", "B000GBEWRU", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00003CXUP", "B001GCUO4S", "B005CFBZVG", "B000O77SQS", "B00000F0AD", "B008874968", "B0021L8UPS", "B00008WFU5", "B004SIP92O", "B00000IQC4", "B002VWNIDG", "B00079Z9WI", "B000UJ48P4", "B00L89VL96", "B0020PFYHC", "B0056P6SOG", "B0006SSOHC", "B000MM0LIM", "B001AGXEAG", "B00441GYVA", "B007STBUHI", "B00006FDBT"], "bought_together": ["B004LWZW2O"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00KDU8HQQ", "B004LWZW2O", "B004SIP9MY", "B004H83IM8"]}, "price": 36.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 141897}, "asin": "B00004W20F", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/416FN80BG7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Scream Trilogy - Boxed Set"}
{"description": "In a remote house in the Russian countryside, Mother is on her deathbed and her adult son is taking care of her. When she asks to go for a walk, he carries her to a bench where she takes a nap, then he carries her to a few places out in nature before bringing her home. Then he goes by a walk himself, returning to his mother who is lying quietly in her bed. Doesn't sound like much, does it? Against this skeletal story, critically acclaimed director Alexander Sokurov manages to push the boundaries of cinema, all the while evoking the deep and sometimes troubled love between a mother and her son. He does this not through quick cuts and hyperkinetic camera moves but by doing just the opposite. More often than not, between lines of dialog the camera is locked down and film is allowed to run through it, while the soundtrack is filled with wind and distant thunder. Consequently, whenever the camera does move, whenever someone does speak, it's electrifying. Sokurov further abstracts his often stunningly beautiful images with odd filters and lenses. Once you get into the pace of the film, it's hard not to get swept away by it, and it's even better on a second viewing.--Andy Spletzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001UE49BQ", "B0002V7OCE", "B003C9VF96", "B00009NHAT", "B00L3ZB8S4", "B0000ALPJ2", "B009NWJV8I", "B00HE011DE", "B00EO2I6S8", "B00J2PQYG8", "B000EDWM0Y", "B00GBT637S", "B000GBEWMA", "B00H91LWBY", "B00HE01030", "B00HVOFP6W", "B00HE010QM", "B0000633SD", "B00GMV8KGW", "B00GPPXOTS", "B00GA9F2PI", "B0000BWVCR", "B0001EFUFK", "B00CX7OW1G", "B00JAGF956", "B008ZDC7M8", "B00073K80M", "B007H7OQW2", "B002AFX53C", "B00AQ6J3AG", "B00005JKGX", "B0087OULO6", "B0000D0YWS", "B00064AEWY", "B006ML50YC", "B007P470R0", "B00005BCJZ", "B000IZJRHE", "B000IHYXH6", "B001BHTNAY", "B0002KQOH6", "B00GPPXNIK", "B000ELJA6K", "B002EEYL5A", "B0009WIE98", "B0006TPDUM", "1848853432", "B000W07ENO", "B000LPS38K", "B0001AOYGA", "B00007L4MH", "B0007LFPKM", "0231165315", "B000068TP3", "B000065AZB", "B0002KQNPO", "B00829WJ6O", "1572522410", "B000LW7L04", "B003AKJN00", "1572528060", "B004RBC5PG", "B005DQVWNK", "B002HMUUP4", "B000MRNWFQ", "B002I8VJ48", "B0016K3988", "B000077VS0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002V7OCE", "B000JQ1AFY", "B000AYELEC", "B000EWBNUU"]}, "price": 29.27, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 280701}, "asin": "B00004W45I", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PN0DAT0QL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mother and Son"}

{"description": "When Sarah (Neve Campbell) strikes up a conversation with a sad-eyed man called Alex (William H. Macy) at her therapist's office, she asks, \"Are you one of those middle-aged guys who's tired of his marriage and thinking maybe a beautiful young thing could help him out?\" She's right, but the source of Alex's depression is far from typical: he's a second-generation hit man who wants out, but his mom and dad won't let him quit.Donald Sutherland makes Alex's laconic and utterly monstrous father the most frightening parent since John Huston inChinatown. A series of flashbacks show how he introduced Alex to his trade, beginning with shooting squirrels in the woods. We never find out whether Alex's father has mob connections, and the fact that it's just a business to him (\"This one's a big job, lots of moola, I'll buy your mother a Lexus\") makes him all the more chilling. Alex's mother (the steely Barbara Bain) knows all about the family business, but his wife (Tracey Ullman) thinks he runs a mail-order company, and the only person he confides in is a therapist (John Ritter). When he meets and falls for Sarah, Alex realizes that he alone can stand up to his father, and he needs to act before his own son becomes the next apprentice.Henry Bromell's debut film as a writer-director probes the same dark corners of the middle-aged male psyche asAmerican BeautyandThe Sopranos. Alex's tormented life is a symbol of the damage that parents can inflict on their children, and Bromell imbues his story with a tragic inevitability.Panicreceived a shamefully limited theatrical release, in spite of its rare combination of a great script and brilliant performances.

{"description": "With its modest special effects, lean plot, and small cast of lesser  stars, this 1951 thriller remains a sturdy blueprint for fusing horror and  science fiction. The formula has been employed countless times since, fleshed  out with more extensive and elaborate production values, and manned by higher profiled marquee names, but the results have yet to improve onThe Thing from Another World, Howard Hawks's lone foray into sci-fi.The story begins as military airmen are dispatched to a remote Arctic research station where scientists have detected the crash of a spacecraft.  An effort to retrieve the saucer-shaped vehicle fails, but the team returns to the station with the frozen body of its sole occupant. When the extraterrestrial pilot is accidentally thawed, the crew, headed by a tough-talking pilot (Kenneth Tobey), grapples with a massive, chlorophyll-based humanoid (James Arness) thirsty for blood and in no mood for galactic diplomacy.Hawks takes only a production credit for this low-budget exercise, but his filmmaking style transcends Christian Nyby's nominal direction: rapid-fire, overlapping dialogue, an ensemble of comrades whose professionalism is tempered by wisecracks, and unsentimental female characters (embodied by feisty romantic interest Margaret Sheridan) recall Hawks's signature works, while propelling the plot over any potential gaps in credibility. It's hardly surprising, then, thatThe Thing from Another Worldremains among the most influential science fiction movies ever shot, or that it remains exciting entertainment a half century later.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKFR", "0783240953", "6303257801", "6302120101", "B00007JME0", "B000AQKU72", "B000DZC5PA", "B007Y1NNAW", "6300183084", "B00005R1O7", "6302890721", "0790731975", "6304507348", "0792835077", "6301977742", "0783236352", "6301977149", "6301968948", "6300208508", "B0000068SI", "B000JTATHG", "6301661729", "6304429274", "6300247589", "0790752395", "6302526191", "B000HDNPM0", "6303398375", "630442972X", "6303953492", "6302763835", "6301976401", "0783103107", "6300215539", "6302843200", "630168740X", "6300213900", "6300216500", "6300181278", "6302841798", "6300213838", "6302182530", "6300269477", "6300185281", "6300247597", "6301562178", "0790736055", "6300182533", "6300181340", "B00004R67T", "630258793X", "6303082815"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKFR", "B007Y1NNAW"], "also_viewed": ["B0067QPVJ6", "6300182878", "B000FOPPEC", "6303506291", "B00005JKFR", "6300247171", "B0045HCJKS", "B00AEBB8VK", "B00IYJFB2G"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 345640}, "asin": "B00005JG70", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5120YBRYW7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Thing From Another World [VHS]"}
{"description": "Antoine Fuqua (THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS, BAIT) turns up the intensity level with TRAINING DAY, a charged drama about police corruption in downtown Los Angeles. Ethan Hawke stars as Jake Hoyt, a well-intentioned young officer who thinks he's found his ticket to becoming a detective in the form of undercover officer Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Harris is a notorious figure in the streets and in the office. He also has the authority to make Jake's professional wishes come true, provided Jake is able to prove his worth on Alonzo's team. At first, Alonzo's blunt, carefree demeanor provides a shock to Jake's optimistic system, but as it becomes clear that Alonzo is dangerously out of control, Jake must decide whether or not to risk his future in the name of the law.\n\nWashington's performance as the evil, pragmatic detective is a sight to behold. He delivers his lines with a devilish ferocity that keeps the film bubbling throughout. Hawke slips into the role of the rookie everyman with ease, providing a good contrast to Washington's fiery presence. Former video director Fuqua completes the picture by casting musicians Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and Macy Gray in supporting roles.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792841778", "630268644X", "6303012140", "6300214826"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 428216}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.0, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005JKEC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/415AYTB1GNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Training Day [VHS]"}
{"description": "In the Imperial Valley of Southern California there is a little known body of water 226 feet below sea level, one of the lowest points in the United States. As there is no outlet from this sea, water is being removed only by evaporation, which results in a salinity level more than 25 percent higher than the Pacific Ocean. There is an eerie stillness to this vast sea, and a peculiar density to the water. This lake is the Salton Sea. Set against this remote and mysterious landscape, an unexpected and brutal crime leaves an innocent woman, caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, dead at the hands of masked gunmen. Her husband's life is left in ruins, his every waking moment haunted by the recurring imagery of the murder he witnessed, but was powerless to prevent. \"The Salton Sea\" is a character-driven crime thriller about an unlikely hero entangled in a web of deceit and treachery. Full of unexpected twists and turns, this is a compelling and emotionally-charged story about loss and recovery set to the lonely resonant tones of jazz great Miles Davis' horn. Danny Parker (VAL KILMER) is a man in search of redemption, consumed by a sense of loneliness and alienation. Following the death of his wife (CHANDRA WEST), he is set adrift in a seedy underworld inhabited by an eclectic, and often comical, cast of characters united principally by their choice of drug: crystal methamphetamine. An accomplished jazz musician, Danny is now a low-life \"tweaker\" in Los Angeles who leads us through a frenzied maze, one from which he must emerge before his tenuous grip on reality snaps for good. In a bold attempt Danny secretly hatches a plan to serve as middle-man in a lucrative drug deal. With the help of his friend Jimmy \"The Finn\" (PETER SARSGAARD), Danny is introduced to Pooh-Bear (VINCENT D'ONOFRIO), a methamphetamine baron with a penchant for sadistic recreational games, who seals the deal. But in this mad world, nothing - most of all Danny - is what it seems.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JM23", "B000LPS4L6", "B00022XE6S", "B00005Q4CS", "6305594333", "B000S0GYP2", "B000LAZDPG", "B00006L92T", "B001AK3S4O", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00004ZBVM", "B00J0BTF4M", "0767837398", "B00005NB8K", "B000F5GNX8", "B003Y5H5EM", "B008FYZI2I", "B0016BO72O", "B0012680CQ", "B0001EFTTW", "B000P0J0D8", "0767821629", "0783229526", "B008NNY8RM", "6305364559", "B00005R5GF", "B000BMY2MO", "0780618564", "B000I0QL7I", "6305127646", "B0001FGBUW", "B00005J75X", "B000QXDCLA", "B0000694Z2", "B002KLQ2ZO", "B000BVM1UA", "B000055WFW", "B00009Y3QI", "B00003CXWV", "B004UVYQYQ", "B00005O5AY", "B0000CERP3", "B005OTGRZE", "B00000JSJC", "B000B6CO48", "B001J9KJ48", "B000JBXXYK", "B000C20VVE", "B000MEYKD2", "0767805763", "B000065U1Q", "B0006IIKRG", "B0071BY2EG", "B00195I3O0", "B002OVB9YE", "B00004WZ0A", "B000929VTU", "B00003CXKM", "B00009QUH4", "B002AF4Y9G", "0780627849", "B0007CEXYK", "B00049QQHI", "6304711905", "B000P0J0AG", "B00079HZQ6", "B00006SFKM", "0780619951", "B00441GZ00", "0790742454", "B0006GAOMW", "B00AEFY4IA", "B00K0MM4AM", "B000099T4G", "B0028OH568", "B001EDFSIQ", "B00003CWSX", "B007N5YJMA", "1935195328", "B0000TPA0G", "B0009S2T0M", "B00008WI9N", "B003IWYWC4", "B000NO39FG", "B000A9QK6E", "B0045HCJ0S", "B00143XE00", "B001B1UO7G", "B002ZMZB64", "B00008RH3L", "0792846435", "B0016MJ6T2", "B00005JLWN", "B00007L4KI", "B0057ZAA0S", "B000I0RNVQ", "B00000JGHL", "B00006JMQ4", "B00GM5GLDW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JM23", "B000S0GYP2", "B000LPS4L6", "B005OTGRZE"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 38953}, "asin": "B00005JKM2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41REB5CM83L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Salton Sea"}

{"description": "A Beautiful Mindmanages to twist enough pathos out of John Nash's incredible life story to redeem an at-times goofy portrayal of schizophrenia. Russell Crowe tackles the role with characteristic fervor, playing the Nobel prize-winning mathematician from his days at Princeton, where he developed a groundbreaking economic theory, to his meteoric rise to the cover ofForbesmagazine and an MIT professorship, and on through to his eventual dismissal due to schizophrenic delusions. Of course, it is the delusions that fascinate director Ron Howard and, predictably, go astray. Nash's other world, populated as it is by a maniacal Department of Defense agent (Ed Harris), an imagined college roommate who seems straight out ofDead Poets Society, and an orphaned girl, is so fluid and scriptlike as to make the viewer wonder if schizophrenia is really as slick as depicted. Crowe's physical intensity drags us along as he works admirably to carry the film on his considerable shoulders. No doubt the story of Nash's amazing will to recover his life without the aid of medication is a worthy one, his eventual triumph heartening. Unfortunately, Howard's flashy style is unable to convey much of it.--Fionn Meade", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SIP7ZS", "B0043X1FL8", "B004FQX5B6", "B00AEFZ63M", "B0000YEEGM", "B00003CWQR", "B000ARTN3I", "B000EHQU0S", "6305144168", "0767811100", "B000066HAS", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEFYSWM", "B0002B15ZG", "1451628420", "B00000IQV7", "B000021Y7L", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFY5B6", "B003ASLJQI", "B000XJD3JI", "B004SUDQ22", "B004U7MR1Y", "B00A81MV3U", "B0043X1FM2", "B00B0U2SFE", "B002NZK5UK", "B000N6U0E2", "B003B3NGS6", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00004RJ73", "B00003CWRX", "B00125WAWS", "B00005JLSB", "6305428352", "B00008EY60", "0800141806", "B00001ZWUS", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEBB9CS", "6304712936", "0780619587", "B00007GZR5", "B000YAF4MA", "B000KX0IOA", "B004SIP8W0", "B00080ZG10", "B00B9LNPA6", "0783225733", "B003U0AHBO", "B00004BZIY", "B00005JND5", "B000E33VWW", "B003NF97NK", "B0038M2AZA", "B002CPMB9O", "B000P0J0EM", "B000A3XY5A", "B00AFEXRME", "B00005Q4CS", "B000LC55F2", "B00AEBB9SM", "B0006FYOTC", "B000056VP4", "B002WNU0QW", "B000RTB0R6", "0684819066", "B00003CXZ4", "B00AEFY17E", "B000EGDB10", "B002VECM6S", "B002ZG980U", "B001P9KR8U", "B001N44BVQ", "B000LP6KNU", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0002V7ON8", "B0018CWW5K", "B00JPQ1INI", "B0030Y12FU", "B003ELKNH2", "B000K2UGZM", "B00121QGPY", "B0001CNRAM", "B00003CXFV", "0783223609", "B007N31YH0", "B002HK9IDQ", "B005BYBZEK", "B000JJ5F8O", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B003UESJHO", "B00A7MSQSO", "B004SIP9U6", "B00005JL78", "B00012QLB4", "B003UESJH4", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000K7VHQE"], "bought_together": ["B004SIP7ZS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00C7MW5EI", "B004SIP7ZS", "B001F34HRS", "B00001ZWUS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3605}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.99, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

{"description": "The venerable Superman mythos gets a 21st-century updating in this imaginative and engaging television series from the WB Network, and series fans can celebrate the ratings success ofSmallvillewith a six-disc set that compiles its entire first season. The deluxe package offers a chance to revisit the origins of the characters and their numerous plotlines, as well as view deleted scenes and other bonus features.The premise ofSmallville--Superman as a teenager--takes up just a few pages in Superman's very first comic book appearance (inAction Comicsback in 1938), but series producers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar flesh out that period by portraying young Clark Kent (Tom Welling) not as the noble Superman-in-waiting, but as an average teen with some not-so-ordinary supernatural powers, including incredible strength and heat vision (Clark hasn't lifted up, up, and away as of yet). Clark's desire to fit in with his peers and make sense of his extraordinary abilities ground him in very realistic and identifiable terms for the series' primarily under-25 audience, as does his appealing and tentative romance with Kristen Kreuk as Clark's dreamgirl Lana Lang. ButSmallvillealso strikes gold when it takes a turn towards more comic book territory, as evidenced by the parade of shape-shifting killers and other outlandish antagonists (many generated, in one of the series' most ingenious notions, by the same devastating meteor shower that brought the infant Clark to Earth) that Clark must harness his powers to face and defeat. Gough and Millar, along with their capable cast (which includes Michael Rosenbaum as a young and already bald-pated Lex Luthor, and Annette O'Toole and John Schneider as the Kents) manage to pull off the precarious high-wire act of combining science fiction with coming-of-age drama to create this highly watchable program.Smallville: The Complete First Seasonoffers a very complete and attractive DVD package that is rounded out by some highly desirable extras for longtime series fans. The six-disc set offers all 21 episodes of the first season, including the pilot, in widescreen anamorphic format; Gough and Millar are featured on the set's sole commentary track, which appears on the pilot episode. Viewers can also access a number of deleted scenes from various episodes as well as view original pre-production storyboards and WB promotional spots. An interactive \"tour\" of Smallville rounds out the extras, but DVD-ROM owners can use the discs to access more features via theSmallvilleweb site.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001JXPPC", "B0002Y0QV2", "B0009A5MUO", "B000G1R4SO", "B000N6SE4U", "B000X5SMXY", "B001FB4VZS", "B002JVWRDQ", "B003L77GG0", "B002JVWRE0", "B0012U7IWU", "B000R206FK", "B003L77GGA", "B001FB4W02", "B00080ZG2O", "B000BT96EG", "B004XWLN20", "B00BBXSPES", "B00BBXSPCK", "B000EHSVLE", "1419826670", "B000EHSVLY", "B000FP2OPY", "B00BGI086Q", "B000R204DY", "B000EU1Q2M", "B001ILFUB4", "B0072BNKHA", "B002JVWRAO", "B000NOKFGW", "B000R7GKQE", "B000FDDYPA", "B000EHSVM8", "B00F4FFO8E", "B000JLTRIG", "B000CCBCGM", "B009LDCXNY", "B000X5SPBI", "B001MVWRNE", "1401238246", "B00CN009Y2", "B00260HH30", "B00DYEN6XC", "B000P6XQ50", "B00DX88IL4", "B0013K2ZFY", "B0006IUE16", "B008JFUPFI", "B000EHSVL4", "B000HT3P60", "B009LDCWWG", "B0015RRNMA", "B00077BPA0", "B000HT3P7E", "B000SMNL92", "B000PFSYO4", "B002LWJ510", "B000P6YNTI", "B001FB4W0C", "B00079FUI6", "B003FSTN5M", "B005SH63HO", "B00AKK6MD4", "1563891182", "B00005JLIC", "B00G7QPX6C", "B009OAWMK8", "B002JVWR4A", "B0053O8AKU", "B005YU8WO2", "B00634MLIQ", "B004EPZ07K", "B000CCBC9O", "B001992NWO", "B000BT96FA", "B0087ZG7NO", "B008JFUS0U", "B000GG4Y6O", "B000PMFRTC", "B0018CWEUI", "1401246370", "B00005JNJV", "B000HEZEY6", "B004YPED14", "B00AZMFJYA", "B000RO6JYK", "B000BOH986", "B000F8O2P6", "B004FM2EQC", "B000HCO83Q", "B002BFBB0A", "B001L1S1OY", "B0000AGQ2H", "B000I0QLQY", "B00005JM3A", "B0006Z2KZ2", "B008X6N8KW", "B00915G6TE", "B00EIL7E9C", "B001G0MFIS"], "bought_together": ["B0001JXPPC", "B0002Y0QV2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B006CR2ON6", "B004XWLN20", "B0001JXPPC", "B000G1R4SO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7871}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.75, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B00005JLKB", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51hmhycPIYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Smallville: Season 1"}

{"description": "It's not that the folks at Pixar are geniuses when it comes to DVDs... well, come to think of it, their fifth DVD set shows these folks are wizards. It's not just that the two discs are packed with watchable extras that hardly reiterate the same information; it's how they are handled--funny, inventive, with a light touch--unlike many PR-driven discs. A good place to start is the filmmakers' jolly commentary track, which branches off into 31 minutes of behind-the-scene stuff, deleted scenes, and curious anecdotes (they can also be watched separately). Pixar's first making-of documentary is a most concise and interesting 25-minute examination that also sheds light on how the company works. With a digital-to-digital transfer, the film looks great and is available in widescreen or reformatted to full screen. The \"Family Fun\" disc includes another Pixar made-for-the-DVD gem, the 7-minute \"Exploring the Reef\" with Jean-Michel Cousteau (Jacques's son) being upstaged by Dori and Marlin; it's a hoot and teaches a fact or two you will remember about reefs.

The story finds Earth's post-World War III humankind in a state of severe emotional repression: If no one feels anything, no one will be inspired by dark passions to attack their neighbors. Writer-director Kurt Wimmer's monochromatic,Metropolis-influenced cityscape provides an excellent backdrop to the heavy-handed mission of John Preston (Christian Bale), a top cop who busts \"sense offenders\" and crushes sentimental, sensual, and artistic relics from a bygone era. Predictably, Preston becomes intrigued by his victims and that which they die to cherish; he stops taking his mandatory, mood-flattening drug and is even aroused by a doomed prisoner (Emily Watson). Wimmer's wrongheaded martial arts/dueling guns motif is sheer silliness (a battle over a puppy doesn't help), butEquilibriumshould be seen for Bale's moving performance as a man shocked back to human feeling.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006JDVV", "B000LC55F2", "B000FS9FCG", "B0009A40ES", "B000KX0IM2", "B0007Y08QA", "B00AEFYCW8", "0767805712", "B00005JL78", "B0018O4YT0", "B001FB55HQ", "B00003CXZ4", "B00AEFXCLU", "B000FGGE68", "B000WMA6R8", "B002ZG980U", "B003XURDAY", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00005JPAR", "B000GFLKF8", "B00K2CHX9C", "B00AEFXW8I", "B000XR9L50", "B004XQO90O", "B000N6TX1I", "B000FKO5QK", "B004SIP9Z6", "B007WZTMCI", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000093FLA", "B0073U2FB2", "0783225814", "B000K7VHQ4", "B001OQCVI8", "B00011CZRE", "B000P0J0AQ", "B00000JSJC", "B0000AXE8I", "B008JFUQZ2", "B007X4ECMI", "B002ZG97CO", "B00AZMFJYA", "B008JFUO36", "B004P2VQZC", "B0000AC8LR", "B0045HCJT4", "B00J5LXT6M", "B00AEFY5B6", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00177Y9ZC", "B003UESJHO", "B000XA5K48", "B001DJLD1M", "B008JFUN50", "B005LAIHXQ", "B00K7IPFSM", "B0006IIPIK", "B005LAII8A", "B0013PSTMC", "B008JFUNHI", "B001L57ZYM", "B002QEHPQU", "B0034G4ORC", "B004SIP95G", "0767802519", "B001TOD92C", "B008JFUS0U", "B000087F6L", "B0051MKNV8", "B007WXUVHU", "B005LAIH2C", "B000R9U3B0", "B004LWZW7E", "B000MZHW40", "B00005JNJV", "B00005JPD0", "B000GGSMC6", "B0000ACOXL", "B0085A9HU6", "B009YQJ322", "B003Y5H5GK", "B009MO57H6", "B004LWZW4M", "0800195175", "B002QW7ALM", "B00005JMA8", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B001EAWMGA", "B002O3Z4WU", "B000BW7QWW", "B001GUYB08", "B00005V9HH", "B001UV4XWY", "B00A8MGIZG", "B002GSXKNI", "B00IARA8KM", "B004LWZWGA", "B00005JA8B", "B001QTXM5Y"], "bought_together": ["B000LC55F2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007Y08QA", "B006ZL1PGG", "B000LC55F2", "B004P7CMJG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 61424}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.34, "brand": "Dimension", "asin": "B00005JLWN", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K2WVH130L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Equilibrium"}

{"description": "Batman Beginsdiscards the previous four films in the series and recasts the Caped Crusader as a fearsome avenging angel. That's good news, because the series, which had gotten off to a rousing start under Tim Burton, had gradually dissolved into self-parody by 1997'sBatman & Robin. As the title implies,Batman Beginstells the story anew, when Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) flees Western civilization following the murder of his parents. He is taken in by a mysterious instructor named Ducard (Liam Neeson in another mentor role) and urged to become a ninja in the League of Shadows, but he instead returns to his native Gotham City resolved to end the mob rule that is strangling it. But are there forces even more sinister at hand?Cowritten by the team of David S. Goyer (a veteran comic book writer) and director Christopher Nolan (Memento),Batman Beginsis a welcome return to the grim and gritty version of the Dark Knight, owing a great debt to the graphic novels that preceded it. It doesn't have the razzle dazzle, or the mass appeal, ofSpider-Man 2(though the Batmobile is cool), and retelling the origin means it starts slowly, like most \"first\" superhero movies. But it's certainly the best Bat-film since Burton's original, and one of the best superhero movies of its time. Bale cuts a good figure as Batman, intense and dangerous but with some of the lightheartedness Michael Keaton brought to the character. Michael Caine provides much of the film's humor as the family butler, Alfred, and as the love interest, Katie Holmes (Dawson's Creek) is surprisingly believable in her first adult role. Also featuring Gary Oldman as the young police officer Jim Gordon, Morgan Freeman as a Q-like gadgets expert, and Cillian Murphy as the vile Jonathan Crane.--David HoriuchiBatmanat Amazon.comAllBatmanDVDsBatman Begins101: A Comic Book PrimerWhere Have I Seen Christian Bale?AllBatmanComics and Graphic NovelsBatmanToysBatman BeginsSoundtrackStills fromBatman Begins(click for larger images)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA", "B002GSXKN8", "B000P0J06U", "B001OST0LW", "B000P0J06K", "B004EPZ07K", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00005JKCH", "B001GCUO1Q", "B002ZG980U", "B001OST0M6", "B008JFUPFI", "B004LWZWFQ", "B00005JMQW", "B004LWZW42", "B000VI70QS", "B001DHXT20", "B000M341QE", "B0000959N0", "B000UR9T8C", "B00005JNTU", "B000AYELVA", "B00E5I2M6I", "B002IPFWTE", "B000HEVZ9E", "B0090SI56Y", "B002HWRYJE", "B0006L0LOS", "B000OVLBF8", "B00003CWT6", "B000VR0570", "B00E5I2MEK", "B000HCO83Q", "B0007P0Y7C", "B008JFUO72", "B00F4FFO8E", "B001CDR1FG", "B000P0J0EW", "B002T9H2LA", "B0002KVUKM", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00005N5S5", "B0083SBMBM", "B0001BKAEY", "B00AQSN7HE", "B000J10EQU", "B00005JKZY", "B002NXSRVG", "B000AYELVU", "B001OQCV6A", "B004LWZW4M", "B001VLBDD0", "B001GZ6QEC", "B004GJYRA0", "B007REV4T8", "B001TK80C0", "B000HRJLII", "B001QTXM5Y", "B005G4TJUC", "B00005JKZV", "B0053FANT0", "B00005JA8B", "B003YAR97K", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00001ZWUS", "B004EPYZQC", "B001N44BVQ", "B006VRRGNK", "B001AEF6HM", "B00000JQB5", "B00011CZRE", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00AEFY0F2", "B007K3JFUQ", "B0002IQMAM", "B00005JN0T", "B002SJIO4A", "B000VWYJ86", "B0013FDM7E", "B00005JNTI", "B00407PNY2", "B00DTPRZ24", "B008JFUS0U", "B00004Z4WR", "B000FS9FCG", "B000QXDED6", "B0085A9HU6", "0780624890", "B00005LOUK", "B000065U1N", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005JN5T", "B001QB9H1U", "B00005JMUA", "0792844890", "B0007DFJ0G", "B004EPYZSK", "B008JFUOWM", "B00AEFY5B6"], "bought_together": ["B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009JBWOU0", "B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA", "B002ZG980U"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7806}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.99, "brand": "DC Comics", "asin": "B00005JNJV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518zjc4XtzL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Batman Begins (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Despite super effects, a huge budget, and the cinematic pedigree of alien-happy Steven Spielberg, this take on H.G. Wells's novel is basically a horror film packaged as a sci-fi thrill ride. Instead of a mad slasher, however, Spielberg (along with writers Josh Friedman & David Koepp) utilizes aliens hell-bent on quickly destroying humanity, and the terrifying results that prey upon adult fears, especially in the post-9/11 world. The realistic results could be a new genre, the grim popcorn thriller; often you feel like you're watching Schindler's List more than Spielberg's other thrill-machine movies (Jaws,Jurassic Park). The film centers on Ray Ferrier, a divorced father (Tom Cruise, oh so comfortable) who witnesses one giant craft destroy his New Jersey town and soon is on the road with his teen son (Justin Chatwin) and preteen daughter (Dakota Fanning) in tow, trying to keep ahead of the invasion. The film is, of course, impeccably designed and produced by Spielberg's usual crew of A-class talent. The aliens are genuinely scary, even when the film--like the novel--spends a good chunk of time in a basement. Readers of the book (or viewers of the deft 1953 adaptation) will note the variation of whom and how the aliens come to Earth, which poses some logistical problems. The film opens and closes with narration from the novel read by Morgan Freeman, but Spielberg could have adapted Orson Welles's words from the famous Halloween Eve 1938 radio broadcast: \"We couldn't soap all your windows and steal all your garden gates by tomorrow night, so we did the best next thing: we annihilated the world.\"--Doug ThomasWar of the Worldsat Amazon.comThe SoundtrackThe War of the Worlds(1953)War of the Worlds - The Complete First Season(TV series)Classic Sci-Fi Movies and Their RemakesAliens Invade on DVDThe Prog-rock Opera (no kidding)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B00005JL78", "B001SGEUYW", "B00008G8M4", "B00005JL3T", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AEFXNLY", "B00005JMXX", "B001OQCV2E", "B000VECAD0", "B002O3Z510", "B0002V7OI8", "B000H30B2C", "B000EGDB10", "B00005JN2Z", "B005LAIIMG", "B005PTYP70", "B002O3Z50G", "B0002V7ON8", "B00005JN0T", "B00K2CHW48", "B002SJIO4A", "0783225547", "B008JFUO36", "B00005JKLZ", "B00AS1Q93S", "1936594056", "B004EPYZUS", "B001TUZG4K", "B00AEFXR1K", "B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFXYJA", "0767817478", "B0034G4ORC", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00070FX5U", "B0045HCJSA", "B00000G3PA", "B005LAIHPE", "B003Y5H5GK", "B00AEBBA72", "B00003CWU3", "B00I9TDMRM", "B001ECDVKE", "B00003CXXP", "B000V4UFZK", "B0010X73ZG", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00005JKFR", "B000XT1P4S", "B003HKN52U", "B0009PW4D2", "B000HRMAPE", "B004EPYZPS", "B0018QPPXW", "B0002WZTOI", "B00AEBB9LO", "B004LWZW4M", "B003ABZHAO", "B003YJFALS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B000OT6V64", "B004P7CN7W", "B000CCBC9O", "B00000ILDD", "0767803434", "B001L57ZYM", "B000065V3G", "B007STBUHI", "B002ZG980U", "B008JFUQZ2", "B00005B6JZ", "B0006GANOQ", "B000F1IQN2", "1494343576", "B001GCUO02", "B00004Y87O", "0783226810", "B004EPYZSK", "B000P0J0BU", "B005LAIHXQ", "B001680M26", "B000EQHXN2", "B0045HCJFS", "B00004BZIY", "B00008G8M5", "B00003CXQA", "B008JFUS0U", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00EIN6KJ0", "B0000DZ6N3", "B000MV8A9A", "B00005JKYX", "B0000YEEGM", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B0013FCWUW", "B002ZG9864", "B00003CWTI", "B008MIMWQW", "B00IKM5OCO"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBB8VK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B004LWZW4M", "B00005JL78", "B004EPYZSK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18739}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JNTI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51upxzPRnXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "War of the Worlds"}

An all-star ensemble cast shines in this comical and poignant look at breakups, breakdowns and breakthroughs. Joel (Jim Carrey) is stunned to discover that his girlfriend, Clementine (Kate Winslet), has had their tumultuous relationship erased from her mind. Out of desperation, he contacts the inventor of the process, Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson), to get the same treatment. But as his memories of Clementine begin to fade, Joel suddenly realizes how much he still loves her.

{"description": "In the DVD world, the Criterion Collection label generally indicates that you'll be getting your money's worth on the extras, andThe Life Aquatic with Steve Zissouis no exception. These two discs contain many features that fans of the film will expect: Seu Jorge performing David Bowie songs (complete versions), many documentary scenes of writer-director Wes Anderson at work, interviews with cast members including Cate Blanchett, Bill Murray, etc. Other extras are a little more confusing. For instance, does Seymour Cassel, who plays Zissou's deceased partner, know what he's doing when he complains to a hairless cigar merchant about having to go faux bald? And what's the deal withMondo Monda? It's a cringingly awkward Italian talk show in which the host (also an actor in the film) interviews the screenwriters, throwing out references so random and esoteric that even smart guys like Anderson and Noah Baumbach are left speechless. It's all a joke, right? In the end, the bonus material accomplishes its primary goal: get those who already enjoy the film to like it just a little bit more.--Leah Weathersby", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0010X8NF0", "6305428239", "B0000640VJ", "0767821408", "B007L6VR12", "B001QOGYBI", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B007L6VR6M", "B000CS464G", "B0006TPE4C", "081099741X", "B00005JMJ4", "B000934FC2", "B0035G5IOE", "B00JAQJNN0", "B00005JMJG", "B000BRD6T4", "B0045NXMJE", "B00007AJF8", "B00H9HZITU", "B0018BD9DA", "B004SEUIXS", "1623160510", "B001P3SA8K", "B000JMK6LW", "B0018O4YT0", "B001MM3AZM", "B0006H32EI", "B002E2M5IC", "B0012E2GFK", "B000M4RG7E", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000Y7U98C", "B001NPD9PY", "B00IJXJAIS", "B000A7DVR2", "B008MIMWP8", "B004FQX5B6", "B00GKOJ98E", "0783228457", "B000K7VHOG", "B002LMV7RA", "B00008RH3J", "B0009A40ES", "B00DL46ZN8", "0957490909", "B000F5GNX8", "B00005JLRE", "B00006AUIH", "B00005V9HH", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B001JIE7JM", "B000IU37SO", "B004RQDQIQ", "B00AEBB8SS", "B00006LPGP", "B00000K3TS", "B00H9L28OO", "B007D5E7C2", "B000065AI3", "B0033WH6MW", "B008220D5K", "B0014D5RBE", "B001BPJJ9G", "B00005JL78", "B007D0FVRM", "B00AEFYOJE", "B00003CXZ4", "6304493681", "B0083V2W4U", "B000Z8GZYW", "B008R65XNS", "0783229526", "B00HGGUTPW", "B003UESJMO", "B005HK13SG", "B000P0J0EW", "B002VWNIAY", "B000P0J0D8", "B004SIP7ZS", "B001HN69AY", "B003XURDAY", "B00H7KJRVY", "B00ECR7KX2", "B001GMAVGE", "B005LAIIJY", "B000055Y0X", "B0000AC8LR", "B000K7VHQE", "B00AEFYAMA", "6305922756", "B0041T52S6", "B009YQJ322", "B003CRM6PA", "B002T9H2LA", "B000O76ZQC", "B0040QYROA", "B005MYEQ4U", "B00I6JOD2S", "B00FZ4KR4U"], "bought_together": ["B0010X8NF0", "B0000640VJ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00JAQJMJ0", "B0010X8NF0", "B007L6VR12", "B0000640VJ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 72305}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.5, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JNLQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H5Q2VBE1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (The Criterion Collection)"}
{"description": "The trend is to convertmovies into stage musicals, butThe Producersgoes a step further: making a feature film of the smash-hitstage musicalthat was adapted from the1968 film. The chief drawing card, of course, is Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprising their roles from the stage. Lane plays Max Bialystock, a legendary Broadway producer who hasn't had a hit show in a long time. Enter nebbish accountant Leo Bloom (Broderick), who tells Bialystock he could actually make more money with a flop than a hit. So the two set out to produce the worst Broadway musical of all time, one guaranteed to close on opening night, with the collaboration of an outrageous cast of characters: Will Ferrell as sieg heil-ing author Franz Liebkind, Uma Thurman as Swedish bombshell Ulla, Gary Beach as director Roger De Bris, and Roger Bart as his assistant, Carmen Ghia, among others.As directed and choreographed by Susan Stroman (who did the same honors on Broadway) and co-written by Mel Brooks,The Producersis laugh-out-loud funny. It's also a relentlessly over-the-top, shamelessly bawdy, stereotype-ridden comedy that may turn off its audience just as much as its centerpiece,Springtime for Hitler, was intended to. But Broadway fans who are used to larger-than-life figures who play to the back row while showering the first row with spit, are likely to forgive and just enjoy the famous granny-walker dance, a supporting cast dotted with Broadway performers (playing a taxi driver is Brad Oscar, who originated the role of Liebkind on Broadway then later played Bialystock), or the mere spectacle of seeing Lane and Broderick memorializing the performances that millions never got a ticket to see. (For maximum laughs, stick around through the closing credits.)--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BMY2LU", "B00005AY6I", "B000BJS4TE", "B00005OCJO", "B00C7A8X4Q", "B004SEUJBE", "B000G6BLYC", "B000E6ESIK", "0786868805", "B0001ZX0O2", "B000E1YVZU", "0792844890", "0792833198", "B001LMAKAG", "B00AEBBAEK", "B000077VR3", "B00007GZRN", "B00001PE59", "B0007TKNII", "B009NYF2GQ", "B0013Z7RUC", "B000G6BLVA", "B002D0L0R2", "B0001Z4OXS", "B002NZK5TG", "B000G6BLWE", "B000G6BLW4", "B000G6BLQU", "B007XTDWKQ", "B00003CX8U", "B0038Z5SOM", "B000BITUNE", "B000E6ESJ4", "B0000AM6IY", "B00008973A", "B000G6BLRE", "B00004W5VC", "B000ATQYVK", "630530209X", "B00GTO6WXU", "6304806418", "B00004XMTJ", "B0060QSGJ0", "B001GKJ2DY", "B002JT69LE", "B001MT7ZEW", "B000I2J6YG", "B000ASDFGI", "0783240287", "B00AMQGCD6", "B005S9EK5Y", "B007LNBS2I", "B0000BWVMQ", "B002D0L0QS", "B000RPCK2E", "B000649YA2", "B00004RFEZ", "B00BX8PG3Y", "B008SBXFUU", "B00AEFYVUQ", "B005NFJAZS", "B0090XLDKY", "B00007J5VN", "B00005UQ8F", "B001PO550A", "B00005JLIU", "B00020X88E", "B00AEFY5TI", "B00DHN8GBC", "B00005JL1P", "B00KRFE9UK", "B00005OCMS", "B002ZG976U", "B00003CXJA", "B004H0M2X2", "B006GHA9QQ", "B000NTM9ZM", "B002N1C1CO", "076781326X", "B00067BBLY", "B000BT970O", "B000BYA4J2", "B00006D295", "B000067IZ3", "B005SFR7YE", "B001MVYUQ6", "B00AATV0WS", "B00DL48BM6", "B000G6BLT2", "B004VJJFDE", "6305161879", "B0000714BP", "B002HK9IDQ", "B001KP2J3K", "B00AEFXDO6", "B00EPH8SBM", "B0000BZK1R", "B00006RZ9Y", "B00005O3VC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BMY2LU", "B000E6ESIK", "0792844890", "B004SEUIWO"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 391998}, "asin": "B00005JO24", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514E4E65KRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Producers"}

{"description": "Helen Mirren reigns supreme inThe Queen, a witty and ingenious look at a moment that rocked the house of Windsor:  the week that followed the sudden death of Princess Diana in 1997. Diana's death came at just the same time that Prime Minister Tony Blair (played by the bright Michael Sheen) was settling into his new government--and trying to figure out the delicate relationship between 10 Downing Street and Queen Elizabeth II (Mirren). A large portion of the British population was trying to figure out the Windsors that week, as Elizabeth remained stiff-upper-lip and largely mum about the death of the beloved princess. In Peter Morgan's skillful script, we watch as Blair grows increasingly impatient with the Royals, who are sequestered in their Scottish estate while the public demands some show of grief. Prince Philip (James Cromwell, in good form) clumsily decides to take Diana's sons hunting, while a sympathetically-treated Prince Charles (Alex Jennings) displays some frustration with his mother's eerie calm.None of this conveys how funny the film is, or how deftly it flows from one scene to the next. Director Stephen Frears (Dirty Pretty Things) deserves great credit for that, and for the performances, and for the movie's marvelous sense of well-roundedness; you could see this movie and groan at the cluelessness of the Royals and their outmoded existence, or you might just sympathize with showing reserve in a world that values gross public displays of emotion. But either way, you'll marvel at Mirren, who makes the Queen far more alert and human than one might ever have imagined.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B003UESJH4", "B001C4AFOY", "B004M9QNVK", "B004GXKBDI", "B0059XTUVI", "B000Z8H0IC", "B000ZOXDFA", "B000RF7XYO", "B001L57ZZG", "B001TH92N4", "B000BKDNX0", "B0006Q93H4", "B000EOTELI", "B004XYOQU4", "B009TT0BSE", "B0012QE4Q2", "B001QUF3SW", "B007HW8U2Y", "B000EHQUGC", "B00342ANSA", "B004SIP9U6", "B000V02CNW", "B00005O7N8", "B00GM7STPI", "B003N9ASF2", "B002ZG99EK", "B004SIP71M", "B003Y5H4Y8", "B0001I55M4", "B001AZIRVI", "B00015HXDG", "B000E1NXJ0", "B000RF7XYY", "B00121QGPY", "B009AMANBA", "B000M06KJ8", "B000MEYJHY", "B00005JOFQ", "B007TBJUVI", "B0085A9JXG", "B003AND1SM", "B000NIVJF4", "B0010X73Z6", "B000K7VHQE", "B00005JKNF", "B000MCH5P4", "B001TR4G6W", "B004P7CNZO", "B0050PYNN0", "B000GH3CR0", "B00AEFY8MM", "B0068MNO4S", "B002RSDW80", "B001MVWFAO", "B004ZNFTDQ", "B000255LIY", "B000V6LSOA", "B00ARX2VZW", "B000G6BM0K", "B008220C38"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003UESJH4", "B004M9QNVK", "B001C4AFOY", "B004GXKBDI"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPAM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K34G0GCBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Queen"}
{"description": "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's Endis a rollicking voyage in the same spirit of the two earlierPiratesfilms, yet far darker in spots (and nearly three hours to boot). The action, largely revolving around a pirate alliance against the ruthless East India Trading Company, doesn't disappoint, though the violence is probably too harsh for young children. Through it all, the plucky cast (Keira Knightley, Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush) are buffeted by battle, maelstroms, betrayal, treachery, a ferocious Caribbean weather goddess, and that gnarly voyage back from the world's end--but with their wit intact. As always, Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow tosses off great lines ; he chastises \"a woman scorned, like which hell hath no fury than!\" He insults an opponent with a string of epithets, ending in \"yeasty codpiece.\"!In the previousThe Curse of the Black Pearl, Sparrow was killed--sent to Davy Jones' Locker. In the opening scenes, the viewer sees that death has  not been kind to Sparrow--but that's not to say he hasn't found endless ways to amuse himself, cavorting with dozens of hallucinated versions of himself on the deck of the Black Pearl. But Sparrow is needed in this world, so a daring rescue brings him back. Keith Richards' much ballyhooed appearance as Jack's dad is little more than a cameo, though he does play a wistful guitar. But the action, as always, is more than satisfying, held together by Depp, who, outsmarting the far-better-armed British yet again, causes a bewigged commander to muse: \"Do you think he plans it all out, or just makes it up as he goes along?\" As far as fans are concerned, it matters not.--A.T. HurleyOn the DVDHere's something you can't say about just any DVD extras: There appears to bemoreof Keith Richards in the outtakes, interviews, and other special features on theAt World's Enddisc than in the actual film. For those scenes alone, this special edition is well worth the price. Richards looks as woozy and gamey as all the rumors suggested, and answers questions he's not asked, with Johnny Depp sitting next to him, almost acting as a translator. Richards offers pithy comments like, \"Everything I do is original, you better believe,\" and smiles when other cast members call him \"Two-Take Richards\" for supposedly nailing his scenes.The packed second disc also includes a terrific mini-doc on how the filmmakers created the famous maelstrom, in an enormous hanger in Palmdale, California, with the ships floating 30 feet off the ground. \"Just moving theBlack Pearlwas an enormous undertaking,\" says producer Jerry Bruckheimer with serious understatement. Other cool extras include \"Tale of the Many Jacks,\" deleted scenes with great commentary, \"The World of Chow Yun-Fat,\" a bio of composer Hans Zimmer, features on the set designers, a look at the impressive Brethren Court, and some hilarious bloopers. \"You can't curse in a Disney film,\" deadpans Depp when a costar blurts out something blue. \"See? I told him.\" The extras are truly as much of a rollicking adventure as the film.--A.T.

{"description": "You know you're going to get a different kind of superhero when you cast Robert Downey Jr. in the lead role. AndIron Manis different, in welcome ways. Cleverly updated from Marvel Comics' longstanding series,Iron Manputs billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (that's Downey) in the path of some Middle Eastern terrorists; in a brilliantly paced section, Stark invents an indestructible suit that allows him to escape. If the rest of the movie never quite hits that precise rhythm again, it nevertheless offers plenty of pleasure, as the renewed Stark swears off his past as a weapons manufacturer, develops his new Iron Man suit, and puzzles both his business partner (Jeff Bridges in great form) and executive assistant (Gwyneth Paltrow). Director Jon Favreau geeks out in fun ways with the hardware, but never lets it overpower the movie, and there's always a goofy one-liner or a slapstick pratfall around to break the tension. As for Downey, he doesn't get to jitterbug around too much in his improv way, but he brings enough of his unpredictable personality to keep the thing fresh. And listen up, hardcore Marvel mavens: even if you know the Stan Lee cameo is coming, you won't be able to guess it until it's on the screen. It all builds to a splendid final scene, with a concluding line delivery by Downey that just feels absolutely right.--Robert HortonStills fromIron Man(Click for larger image)&nbsp;", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00E5I2M6I", "B008JFUO72", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00E5I2MEK", "B0083SBMBM", "B008JFUS0U", "B001CDR1FG", "B00E5I2MAO", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001GCUO1Q", "B008JFUPFI", "B000VI70QS", "B000HEVZ9E", "B0000959N0", "B00005JKCH", "B00005JNJV", "B00005JNTU", "B0090SI56Y", "B000VR0570", "B00005JMQW", "B002HWRYJE", "B0007P0Y7C", "B004LWZW42", "B00D7OMNXS", "B001OQCV6A", "B007K3JFUQ", "B004EPZ07K", "B004LWZWGA", "B000UR9T8C", "B0083SBJXS", "B0060FXDCG", "B002IPFWTE", "B00E5I2ME0", "B00IXD2MGQ", "B000AYELVA", "B00C6B8TB8", "B008QZ5PY2", "B000OVLBF8", "B000AYELVU", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001QB9H1U", "B009JBWOU0", "B001AK3S4Y", "B001GZ6QC4", "B005G4TJUC", "B002NXSRVG", "B000HCO83Q", "B003YOZNBU", "B003Q6D2B4", "B00023B1LC", "B0002IQMAM", "B008JFURII", "B00HERGM86", "B00E5I2MDQ", "B006VRRGNK", "B002ZG99QS", "B00000JQB5", "B007REV4T8", "B00008G8M5", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B0002ZDVEU", "6305718954", "B001DTPZNY", "B005LAIGW8", "B001F7MSFM", "B001GCUNWQ", "B00A2H9P98", "B000RW3VDE", "B002O5M4T4", "B00005JA8B", "B005LAIIPS", "B005LAII44", "B00BEIYHO2", "B000GUJZ00", "B00005N5S5", "B002SJIO4A", "B000VWYJ86", "B004EPZ0BG", "B0049IHX2C", "B00AEBBAEK", "B00005JM5E", "B008JFUOWM", "B000FS9FCG", "B00005PJ6N", "B00979KQFO", "B00AEFXKUI", "B002K0WBXW", "B0042U94UQ", "B004EPYZUS", "B008JFUQZ2", "B0084IG8TM", "B001DJLD1M", "B008JFUS5A", "B00006HBUJ", "B000J103OI", "B00F84H73Q", "B0087ZG7NO", "B000U1ZV8K"], "bought_together": ["B00E5I2M6I", "B008JFUO72"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008JFUO72", "B00E5I2M6I", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2MEK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12121}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "DOWNEY,ROBERT JR.", "asin": "B00005JPS8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515wjJQt2nL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Iron Man (Ultimate 2 Disc Edition)"}
{"description": "Here's hoping James Mangold's big, raucous, and ultrabloody remake of3:10 to Yumaleads some moviegoers to check outDelmer Daves's beautifully lean, half-century-old original. That classic Western spun a tale of captured outlaw Ben Wade (Glenn Ford)--deadly but disarmingly affable--and the small-time rancher and family man, Dan Evans (Van Heflin), desperate enough to accept the job of helping escort the badman to Yuma prison. Wade, knowing that his gang will be along at any moment to spring him, works at persuading the ultimately lone deputy to accept a bribe, turn his back on \"duty,\" and go home safe and rich to his family. That the outlaw has come to admire his captor intriguingly complicates the suspense.All of the above applies in the new3:10, but it takes a lot more huffing and puffing to get Wade (Russell Crowe this time) and Evans (Christian Bale) into position for the showdown. Mostly, more is less. To Mangold's credit, his movie doesn't traffic in facile irony or postmodern detachment; it aims to be a straight-up Western and deliver the excitement and charisma the genre's fans are starved for. But recognizing that contemporary viewers might be out of touch with the bedrock simplicity and strength of the genre--not to mention its code of honor--Mangold has supplied both Evans and Wade with a plethora of backstory and \"motivations.\" At the overblown action climax, the crossfire of personal agendas is almost as frenetic as the copious gunplay. (By that point the movie has killed more people than the Lincoln County War.)Best thing about the remake is Russell Crowe's Ben Wade, a Scripture-quoting career villain with an artist's eye and a curiously principled sense of whom and when to murder. As his second-in-command, Ben Foster fairly pirouettes at every opportunity to commit mayhem, and Peter Fonda contributes a fierce portrait of an old Wade adversary turned bounty hunter for the Pinkerton detective agency.--Richard T.

{"description": "In this inspirational costume drama, Michael Apted (49 Up) recounts a period in British history sure to be unfamiliar to most Americans. In fact, his eye-opening biography of 18th century abolitionist William Wilberforce (Ioan Gruffudd) is likely to come as a revelation to many Britons, as well. After all, despite the presence of his wife, Barbara (Romola Garai), this isn't a particularly \"sexy\" story, but itisa powerful one. The title comes from John Newton's hymn \"Amazing Grace\" (\"I once was lost but now am found\"). Newton (Albert Finney) was a former slaveholder, who became a clergyman and spent his days repenting. While America had John Brown, England had Wilberforce, and Newton is one of many who helped the MP to abolish slavery in the UK. The story begins towards the end of Wilberforce's mission when he's sick with colitis and addicted to laudanum. Apted continues to alternate between 1797 and 1789, when Wilberforce was fitter and more idealistic, and ends in 1807 as his efforts come to fruition. Apted and writer Steven Knight (Dirty Pretty Things) do right by their hero. UnlikeAmistad, however, slaves are largely off-screen, with the exception of author Equiano (Senegalese vocalist Youssou N'Dour).Amazing Gracereserves its focus for the politicians who risked their reps for the greater good, like Wilberforce and Prime Minister Pitt (an excellent Benedict Cumberbatch), and those more concerned with the income slavery provided their constituents, like Lord Tarleton (Ciar&#xE1;n Hinds) and the Duke of Clarence (Toby Jones).--Kathleen C.

{"description": "In this French drama, Gaspar Noe, who won awards (Prix Georges Sadoul, Cannes Crix Week) for his 40-minute Carne (1991), continues where that film ended, beginning with a Carne recap: The Butcher (Philippe Nahon) narrates, telling how, as a war orphan working at 14, he opened his horsemeat butcher shop and fathered a mute, retarded daughter. After the mother and daughter left for life in a Paris suburb, he served a prison term after an assault on someone he mistakenly believed had raped his daughter. The follow-up sequel, set in a Lille suburb, begins in 1980: Obese bar owner (Franjkyie Pain) is pregnant by The Butcher, who is unable to find work. The couple moves in with her mother, but he becomes irritated with the two women and goes to Paris where the humiliation of job-hunting and the sum total of futility and hopelessness triggers thoughts of what he might accomplish with his gun and his last three bullets.

{"description": "Dracula's DaughterThis cut-rate sequel toDracula, sans Bela Lugosi, turns out to be an unexpectedly sleek and stylish movie. Gloria Holden, tall, dark, and continental, is the aristocratic title character fighting her nature and seeking a cure for her affliction. A sympathetic psychiatrist, Dr. Garth (Otto Kruger), encourages her to \"face her fears,\" but when she lures a pretty young streetwalker to her room to model for a painting, the temptation of her fleshy offering proves too much to overcome. Edward Van Sloan reprises his role as Van Helsing, held by the police for the murder of Count Dracula (the film opens on the final scene fromDracula) but released in the nick of time to help Garth, now at the mercy of the bitter and vindictive vampire. Director Lambert Hillyer makes the most of his low budget, with austere, angular sets and an almost abstract sense of the foggy city night. Holden's mysterious face and tall, willowy body make her an even more striking vampire than Lugosi, and Irving Pichel's offbeat servant is like an American gangster with the breeding of a European aristocrat: thick and thuggish, but always proper. The script falls into the usual rut of Universal's later horror films, losing the mood in the busy plot, but the smooth style and Holden's dignified performance liftDracula's Daughterabove most Universal sequels.Son of DraculaIt was perhaps inevitable that, after playing the Wolf Man, Frankenstein's monster, and the Mummy, Lon Chaney Jr. would round out his horror resum&eacute; with a turn at the great bloodsucker himself (not, as the title would suggest, his son). Looking dapper and dignified under the cape, if not exactly threatening, Chaney plays Count Alucard (that'sDraculaspelled backwards), a mysterious Carpathian summoned to America by a \"morbid\" heiress (Louise Allbritton). Eric Taylor's script is rather clunky, but the story (by horror specialist CurtThe WolfmanSiodmak) is often quite clever, playing like a supernatural twist on a psycho-thriller. Allbritton's frustrated fianc&eacute; Robert Page accidentally \"kills\" her while trying to shoot Alucard (who imperiously stands up to the hail of bullets) and then goes stark raving mad as he watches the dead rise to life and the living disappear in wisps of smoke and morph into creaky stage bats.Future film noir legend (and Curt's brother) Robert Siodmak (The Killers) does wonders with the swampy, misty Deep South setting despite his obviously threadbare budget, transforming the usual clich&eacute;s into moments of inspired melodrama. Only the clumsy antics of the skeptical cops and the plodding exposition spouted by an old Carpathian doctor (he just happens to be the local MD) get in the way of this moody minor horror gem.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005LC4L", "B00005LC4N", "B00005LC4M", "B00005LC4K", "B00005LC4O", "B0000694WM", "B000035Z3K", "B0009X770E", "B00000F62P", "B000WNHTCC", "B00005NSXY", "B0009X770O", "B0016586Q8", "B006TTC5J0", "B00B94VJYW", "B001B9ZVVC", "078323502X", "B003M8NGG2", "B000FWHW8Q", "B00001TZ6Q", "B000U1ZV7G", "0783240961", "B000GRUQJW", "B00000JQB7", "B000FWHW90", "B000UDGOBG", "B00000ILEU", "B00005KHJP", "B00009PY38", "0783233582", "B0000694WH", "B00D9EJFZA", "B00LMCDHMS", "B00LNBQ8UG", "B0034PWPHY", "B0000AUHOO", "B0007R4T26", "B00DOZNGC2", "B000FVQLKW", "B00D9EJFV4", "B0002NRRQU", "B000RXVNCY", "B005D0RDKM", "B00009PY4D", "B008HSK3PE", "B00005R1O7", "B00HFWETZ8", "B000EHSVJG", "B00009NHBC", "B000068TPF", "B000K7VL56", "B00000JMOF", "B000063UR0", "B0002KVULG", "B0000AUHOK", "B002945DUW", "B000UAFDR0", "B000060MVD", "B00009PY4A", "B000A0GOEQ", "B00005AUK0", "B001BSBBGC", "B002DY9KQG", "B000A0GOFA", "B00005RF2C", "B00006G8K0", "B0001CNRLG", "B00009NHC0", "B00FJYXP36", "B009AGEY98", "B0013XZ6SY", "B007Y1NNAW", "B00005NKTH", "B00FMGPWNW", "B007ZFSBWW", "B00DZP1C9K", "B0007R4SZY", "B000RXVND8", "0783240953", "B000VX9WB4", "B000AQKU72", "B000TUDBGG", "B000TLTCT0", "B000R7I48G", "B00ITZXDDY", "B00AWWX8YG", "B00009PY48", "B001BSBBIA", "B00FUABJJQ", "B000A0GOFK", "B000062XEY", "B00005KHJO", "B00000K3U3", "B000AM6OOY", "1559409002", "078324097X", "B00456VHMA", "B007UQ8IQU", "B000BYA5IC", "6305944288"], "bought_together": ["B00005LC4L", "B00005LC4K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005LC4L", "B00005LC4K", "B00005LC4N", "B006TTC5J0"]}, "price": 12.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 40262}, "asin": "B00005LC4J", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518j6eYh1hL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dracula's Daughter/Son of Dracula (Universal Studios Dracula Double Feature)"}

Fans accustomed to the slick appearance of the later episodes will be delighted by the rougher nature of these earlier episodes, when the characters weren't as well defined (Homer isn't quite as dumb as he is in later seasons) and the animation was still evolving. This only adds to the charm of these 13 episodes, which begin with \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire,\" the December 1989 Christmas special in which a down-and-out Simpson family adopt Santa's Little Helper. Throughout the season, familiar faces are introduced, as we catch first glimpses of Smithers, Mr. Burns, the Flanderses, and Patty and Selma. Highlights of the season include \"The Crepes of Wrath,\" in which Bart is sent to France as an exchange student (\"Don't mess up France the way you messed up your room\"); \"Bart the Genius,\" in which Bart ends up in a school for the gifted; and \"Krusty Gets Busted,\" in which Bart's lifelong animosity with Sideshow Bob begins.--Jenny Brown", "related": {"also_bought": ["B007KFZ7UQ", "B007KFZ8AK", "B007KFZ8B4", "B007KFZ8AA", "B000067DNE", "B007KFZ7YM", "B007KFZ7Q0", "B007KFZ7PG", "B007KFZ87S", "B007KFZ88M", "B001GQ3GHG", "B0024FAR52", "B001L1S1PI", "B003KZ27N0", "B005QIOJ3A", "B000WGYMD8", "B000WGYMGK", "B000BQPC42", "B009DW5YJI", "B00F4NPBI4", "B00023P49C", "B0012KSUTA", "B00009N80Z", "B000E6ES9O", "B002R8JE7S", "B000083C6V", "B009DW5X0I", "B008412UKA", "B003KZ27NA", "B005QIOJ6M", "B00L89VL96", "B000NNK4DM", "B00F4NPBAC", "B00008YGRV", "B00005JM3G", "B000B5XOWU", "B00008YGRS", "B00JDFTN60", "B0006Z2L2Y", "B0002PYS60", "B0000CABL2", "0062267752", "B007ZFR67I", "B00023P49M", "B002DKGWSE", "B000HT3P6U", "B0072BNKHA", "B0077ATSSQ", "B001E6HUXO", "B00AIANIPQ", "B001MVWRNE", "B001VFM0ZG", "B00JNB80YU", "B00HX14C7Q", "B000ADWCYY", "B0006Q93CO", "B00008EY6Q", "B008JFUO0Y", "1612185916", "B0000C2IQB", "B006W93ELK", "B005LAIHY0", "B00HN9D22Y", "B00JO5LJG6", "B001FB55HQ", "B001VLBDD0", "B009SQ9Q5M", "B00C7E3E7S", "B001AQO3QA", "B0024FAD9W", "B002N5N5SO", "B000EQHXOG", "B009LDD40U", "B001CK1D44", "B003Y5H5EW", "B0014Z4OMU", "B00I099K4U", "B003L77GDS", "B00JHH1VUU", "0785154620", "B00BUWD7Y8", "B000ELJAEM", "B005LAIIMG", "B002FOQXTQ", "B008MCKL5W", "B00IMIGWD6", "B00DQC2FPM", "B0087ZG7HK", "B00GZ0ML4C", "B00AO686MY", "B001QIVEVE", "B00005JG6M", "B0001I561E", "0385352107", "B00I0VTPWA"], "bought_together": ["B007KFZ7UQ", "B007KFZ8AK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007KFZ7UQ", "B007KFZ8AA", "B007KFZ7YM", "B00F4NPBI4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 70952}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 23.24, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B00005ML6Y", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P2P9TQYCL._SX300_.jpg", "title": "The Simpsons: The Complete First Season"}
{"description": "Amores Perrosroughly translates to \"Love's a bitch,\" and it's an apt summation of this remarkable film's exploration of passion, loss, and the fragility of our lives. In telling three stories connected by one traumatic incident, Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu uses an intricate screenplay by novelist Guillermo Arriaga to make three movies in close orbit, expressing the notion that we are defined by what we lose--from our loves to our family, our innocence, or even our lives. These interwoven tales--about a young man in love with his brother's pregnant wife, a perfume spokeswoman and her married lover, and a scruffy vagrant who sidelines as a paid killer--are united by a devastating car crash that provides the film's narrative nexus, and by the many dogs that the characters own or care for. There is graphic violence, prompting a disclaimer that controversial dog-fight scenes were harmless and carefully supervised, but what emerges fromAmores Perrosis a uniquely conceptual portrait of people whom we come to know through their relationship with dogs. The film is simultaneously bleak, cynical, insightful, and compassionate, with layers of meaning that are sure to reward multiple viewings.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JL57", "B0041KKYF6", "B00008AOX5", "B000N3T0DW", "B001UV4XC4", "B0001CNRRU", "B0002TT0MI", "B002FHGESI", "B0036TGSJE", "B00005JNCZ", "B00AEFXGIY", "B00005JLQW", "B00080Z53O", "B000O76ZQC", "B00006G8G3", "B002M2T1VI", "B000FII31A", "B000GETTJI", "B00180IPM6", "B004XVMCMG", "B0041KKYFG", "B000K2V7F0", "B004SIP6GI", "B000YIGNCC", "B003O3EKRO", "B001S400C0", "B00005LZOD", "B002VECLXC", "B002H0LCGM", "B005HFI7IU", "B0007OCG5G", "B0011FLH14", "B008S2NABI", "B00GJNQ3S0", "B000JBXH78", "B0052LE7C4", "B000RHRGSK", "B001BNFR8U", "B000UUX2SW", "B00AEFXGAW", "B000LV6OC6", "B002M2T1V8", "B009AVCA6W", "B00KE3B8HC", "B004SIP7S0", "B00003CXRG", "B0042EJDGM", "B001MWBK6I", "B0032AJVE6", "B003R9IET0", "B00000F7E6", "B005Q4CKLC", "B00AZMFKXK", "B000274TLW", "B00432M43C", "B000H0M4AW", "B002BWP3UC", "B004PKNYK4", "B0004Z32NI", "B0007NBJHI", "B00E1S1MMM", "1572526599", "B0047685T6", "B0051T46YG", "B0000TPA56", "B0015ET3YO", "B000WC38IC", "B000OVLBGC", "B00JV0547O", "B002BWP3UM", "B001QX014A", "B000LXHFMW", "B00000F5KH", "B002BWP4A6", "B000N3SU6K", "B001R4XRLC", "B004DF3S84", "B000A7Q1O2", "B00112S8RS", "B00GHH9HJA", "B00075VX2C", "B00000G02H", "B001M9ELV2", "B00004RJ71", "B0036TGSJO", "B001M5BF7Y", "B00000F3CD", "B0001CNQX0", "B00003CWTI", "B000M7Y4S0", "B000QXDCLK", "B00003CWSX", "B0001VO38S", "B0002VEZ3U", "B000067IZ3", "B002QFYJF4", "B000N3T0DM", "B000NA6C2M", "B0000A2ZTY", "B001MYIXAC"], "bought_together": ["B00005JL57", "B000N3T0DW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0041KKYF6", "B0002TT0MI", "B002FHGESI", "B000O76ZQC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23708}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.12, "brand": "LION&#39;S GATE ENTERTAINMENT", "asin": "B00005N8A9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X0QYZB1NL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Amores Perros"}
{"description": "If a top-level spy decided he didn't want to be a spy anymore, could he just walk into HQ and hand in his resignation? With all that classified knowledge in his head, would he be allowed to become a civilian again, free to go about his life? The answer, according to the stylish, brilliantly conceived 1960s British TV seriesThe Prisoner, is a resounding no. In fact, instead of receiving a gold watch for his years of faithful service, our hero (played by Patrick McGoohan) is followed home to his London flat and knocked unconscious. When he awakens, he finds himself in a picturesque village where everyone is known by a number. Where is it? Why was he brought here? And, most important, how does he leave?As we learn in Episode 1, Number 6 can't leave. The Village's \"citizens\" might dress colorfully and stroll around its manicured gardens while a band plays bouncy Strauss marches, but the place is actually a prison. Surveillance is near total, and if all else fails, there's always the large, mysterious white ball that subdues potential escapees by temporarily smothering them. Who runs the Village? An ever-changing Number 2, who wants to know why Number 6 resigned. If he'd only cooperate, he's told, life can be made very pleasant. \"I've resigned,\" he fumes. \"I will not be pushed, filed, stamped, indexed, briefed, debriefed, or numbered. My life is my own.\" So sets the stage for the ultimate battle of wills: Number 6's struggle to retain his privacy, sanity, and individuality against the array of psychological and physical methods the Village uses to break him.So does he ever escape? And does he ever find out who Number 1 is? \"Questions are a burden to others,\" the Village saying goes. \"Answers, a prison for oneself.\" Within this complete 17-episode set (which contains the entire series), all is revealed.

{"description": "Love is a mysterious game for the players inChoose Me, writer-director Alan Rudolph's uniquely eccentric spin on matters of the heart. A comedic drama steeped in a nocturnal, smooth-jazz atmosphere, the production is rooted in the mid-1980s but laced with a timeless film noir attitude. Its chamber-piece characters collide and carom from one to the other, each interaction revealing clues about how passions either cloud or clarify our paths to romantic fulfillment. Mickey (Keith Carradine) isn't the pathological liar he's supposed to be; sex-talk radio host Nancy Love (Genevi&egrave;ve Bujold) uses an assumed name and knows far less about sex than she lets on; and bar owner Eve (Lesley Ann Warren) knows too much about men but not enough about love. When they meet and mingle, Rudolph (using Teddy Pendergrass songs as the perfect mood-setting soundtrack) orchestrates a passionate dance of sex, sadness, and self-discovery that's wittily observant and altogether beguiling.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0041SI7D4", "B005OK0YNO", "B000069HZW", "B00HRISNPM", "B000BZN1OQ", "B003TTBA0S", "B0000V492O", "B001IZNIV4", "B00005JM8W", "B00GBT62PQ", "B000069I09", "B00166UFA2", "B0009GX1CE", "B003SEH3EQ", "B00004ZBVO", "B000E6ESXK", "B0000BXMZ1", "B005LLX582", "B0080JG2GE", "B000069HZU", "B000N2HBIO", "B008RNYMPG", "B000TGJ82Q", "B0089LT7ZG", "B001AQO3RO", "B000055ZF8", "B00AATGDUC", "B0002KQNKE", "B004TP55RK", "B00HUCF6KK", "B000NQRR34", "B000E5LEVA", "B00FRKKVL6", "B002T4GY4Q", "B000CNESTE", "B003VA3JTA", "B00AF4OTM6", "B00008CMSX", "B00AEFY9GW", "B004UOHNAC", "B0082LUEFA", "B00004XPPK", "B00023P4II", "B00000K3TU", "B009X919UE", "B00005JKGX", "6305262268", "B0001DMUWM", "0783226853", "B002DQSKMY", "B00ET2ODX0", "B000NIBUS0", "B00A1O0G3G", "B00AEFXLKC", "B004UXVFIO", "B00AEFXN9G", "B0008ENHUI"], "bought_together": ["B005OK0YNO", "B0041SI7D4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0041SI7D4", "B005OK0YNO", "B000069HZW", "B000BZN1OQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 140443}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 44.99, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00005O06R", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41XDRPCYQVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Choose Me"}
{"description": "Fran&ccedil;ois Ozon'sUnder the Sandrevolves around a tender, frightening contrast not easily forgotten: the dead live on only as long as we remember them. Marie (a luminous Charlotte Rampling) and Jean (Bruno Cremer), a middle-aged couple, are on vacation. As they ready the beach house almost wordlessly, a long-standing, intense love is immediately understood. While Marie naps on the shore, Jean goes off for a swim from which he never returns. Six months later, back in her empty Paris apartment, Marie goes about her life as if Jean is still there with her, reading in bed, massaging her feet, sitting at the breakfast table. At dinner parties and lunch dates, her close friends are visibly appalled her behavior. It becomes clear that Marie's place in society is increasingly precarious with a ghost at her side: her husband's bank accounts remain frozen because no body has been identified, her lectures at the university end abruptly in silence, her untimely laughter frightens a new lover. Ozon does not manipulate the viewer with surprise endings or try to charm with gags. Instead, we are intimately drawn into Marie's refusal to let go and her awful panic as Jean begins to fade.--Fionn Meade", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JMIJ", "B00007J5VT", "B002SAMMJ2", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B004AYMY9M", "B00DPJEWDO", "B000IHY9K2", "B00K0MM4AM", "B00FMGPWD2", "B0074V619W", "B000ARXG0E", "B00GAZ1H1U", "B000077VS6", "0792846125", "B004ZBFRRG", "B00023P4I8", "0780022823", "B00B022GVS", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B004JWWT2C", "B006UTC91S", "B00005KCB3", "B000N3SU92", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B00HE010QM", "B000N2G400", "B000HIVIQU", "B000SIWHC8", "B00HRJVHEK", "B0000C9JFO", "B000UVV26A", "B00BNWWVFG", "B000063US3", "B00000F7E6", "B000BGH29K", "B005V4X8PO", "B00003JRAV", "B002VKB0M4", "B00FRILRW0", "B00I3C1T34", "B00004Z1FL", "B00005JKGX", "B00BYGTN5M", "B007REV4LQ", "B004SKJYJG", "B00BTYXNPK", "B0002J4X20", "B0016MLILG", "B00002E20R", "B00008MTW2", "B000E3L7M8", "B0000DIJPW", "6305327068", "0780022343", "B00913M1Z4", "B001BNFRB2", "1572522135", "B000I0RNV6", "B0013FSXT6", "B006M3M5FM", "B000FGGNA0", "B00005NFY4", "B000FFJYAW", "B000MRNWFQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JMIJ", "B002SAMMJ2", "B004AYMY9M", "B00007J5VT"]}, "price": 11.82, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 270394}, "asin": "B00005OSK8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YAN8047SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Under the Sand"}

{"description": "The three nostalgic British musicals in theCliff Richard Collectionare a good reminder that, thanks to a few short years in the 1960s, Sir Cliff can legitimately include \"film star\" on his already exceptional show business r&#xE9;sum&#xE9;.The Young Ones(1961),Summer Holiday(1963), andWonderful Life(1964) would make tame fare for a teen audience today, but they retain a polished and honest charm that might surprise the sharpest of cynics.First and foremost, of course, they were Cliff Richard vehicles: designed to showcase his all-around talents and capitalize on his first, heady wave of pop chart success. They are also unashamed homages to the heyday of the MGM B-musical with familiar themes: let's put on a show/save the youth club/make a film. But with up-and-coming directors Sidney Furie and Peter Yates making imaginative and sophisticated use of wide-angle camerawork and fresh, snappy choreography by Herbert Ross and Gillian Lynne, they also have plenty of assets other than Richard's wholesome appeal. There are some fine set pieces and surreal flashes, notably the history of cinema inWonderful Lifeand the extraordinary mime sequence inSummer Holiday.

{"description": "\"A Simpson on a T-shirt. I never thought I'd see the day.\" So remarks Marge Simpson in \"Dancin' Homer,\" just one of 22 mostly classic episodes that comprise this series' brilliant second season.The Simpsonsby that time was already a pop culture phenomenon, but instead of suffering a sophomore slump, this iconoclastic animated series was just hitting its stride. Series milestones include: first Oscar&#xAE;-winning guest voice (an unbilled Dustin Hoffman in \"Lisa's Substitute\"), first Beatle guest voice (Ringo in \"Brush with Greatness\"), first \"Treehouse of Horror\" Halloween episode, first flashback episode (\"The Way We Was,\" in which Homer meets Marge), and the first episode to make me cry (Bart's last frolic with obedience school washout Santa's Little Helper in \"Bart's Dog Gets an F\"). It's in this season theThe Simpsonsreally finds its voice. The writing is sharper, and the upending of sitcom convention more subversive. \"Perhaps there is no moral to this story,\" observes Lisa at the end of \"Blood Feud.\" \"Exactly,\" agrees Homer. \"Just a bunch of stuff that happens.\"In the first season, Bart was the series' breakout star, but in the second,The Simpsonsestablished itself as a true ensemble series. Each character came into their own with career-best episodes. Marge, the family's long-suffering voice of reason, crusades against cartoon violence in \"Itchy & Scratchy & Marge.\" Lisa, the heart and tortured soul of the series, develops an ill-fated crush on her new teacher in \"Lisa's Substitute.\" Bart desperately tries to raise the money to buy Radioactive Man No. 1 in \"Three Men and a Comic Book.\" Homer's stock rises when he grows hair in \"Simpson and Delilah.\" Joining theSimpsonsroster of scene-stealing supporting characters are Dr. Hibbert (\"Bart the Daredevil\"), shyster lawyer Lionel Hutz (voiced by the late, great Phil Hartman in \"Bart Gets Hit by a Car\"), the Ahnold-esque action hero McBain (\"The Way We Was\"), slobbering aliens Kang and Kodos (\"Treehouse of Horror\"), and \"nutty professor\" Frink (\"Old Money\").

We will all come home together.&rdquo; This heroic true story of commitment, courage and sacrifice also stars Madeline Stowe, Greg Kinnear, Sam Elliott, Chris Klein, Keri Russell and Barry Pepper.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000065U1N", "B0015D20FE", "B00001ZWUS", "B00005JK8K", "079284646X", "B000M4RG42", "B00004XPPG", "B000P0J09C", "B004U7MQWY", "B00AEFXVCU", "B00003CXTG", "B000095WW8", "B00005PJ8T", "0679411585", "B003ELKNH2", "B005LAIGYQ", "B003ASLJOU", "B00006CXSS", "B00HEPE6MM", "B000ELL1R6", "B00AEFXRRO", "B00AMSLDTM", "0345472640", "B00005JPKE", "B00275EGWY", "B006TTC5HC", "0792839730", "B00AEBB86U", "B00005PJ8S", "B0002V7ON8", "B001IBIHQ4", "B000B8QG22", "B00319ECI8", "B0007TKNGA", "B00B0U2SFE", "B000EHSVSC", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEFXKUI", "B00AZNEW5G", "B000O599YO", "B00AEFY0F2", "B005LAIGN2", "B002O3Z4Z2", "0800177967", "B00AEBB86A", "B00HX7DFXC", "6304765258", "B00005N5S3", "B00000G3PA", "B004AOECXI", "B002O3Z510", "B007HCI42A", "B000DZIGDU", "B00AEFY5B6", "B0000TANUI", "B00003CXA6", "0782010040", "B000LAZE8C", "B000W1SZBS", "6304711905", "B004O8LETK", "B00003CXHJ", "B0007KIFGE", "B002O3Z50Q", "B002GHHHPQ", "006114777X", "B00005JA9F", "B00008K76U", "B000JLTRIQ", "B003ASLJO0", "B000XR9L50", "B0042KZJIC", "1558908315", "B001XSCRKO", "B00A34LX2M", "B0001NBMGC", "B00AEFYBA6", "0792841670", "B00005B6JZ", "B00AEBB9NM", "B0001WTWWE", "0792838041", "B00000JDIQ", "B00BY0EBK0", "B0007TKNM4", "B003U0AHBO", "B00ARWXJ54", "B0007TKNDI", "B0002WZTOI", "B004TPJN3C", "B000M341QE", "B000WMA6R8", "B00005PJ8K", "034547581X", "B00024JC4E", "B000A2WJBQ", "B00ALCBTWU", "B00005JNTI", "B0001FGC1U"], "bought_together": ["B00001ZWUS", "B000065U1N"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00001ZWUS", "0679411585", "B000065U1N", "B00006CXSS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 41392}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.45, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B000068TPN", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RtP2kk1TL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "We Were Soldiers (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "The DVD set of theBack to the Futuretrilogy is as classy and  professional as the series. Both new and original materials are included in the  plethora of extras, starting with two sets of making-of documentaries. Each disc  has material on that particular film, and some features look at the trilogy as a  whole. Producer-writer Bob Gale is the star of the extra features, candidly  presenting the original ideas and many deleted scenes (a few with doses of crude  humor). Much of the inside stuff is repeated in the various pieces, but that's  to be expected with such exhaustive materials. Michael J. Fox chimes in with a  video commentary presented in a picture-in-picture format (which would have  worked better as a straight interview) and the producers tackle the main  commentary track, but the highlight audio commentary is a free-flowing Q&A; with  Gale and director Robert Zemeckis in front of a USC film-school audience. Long  or short, the materials are uniformly enjoyable and deft, including segments on  advertising, special effects tests, on-screen anecdotes, outtakes, production  designs, and more.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001E75QH0", "B0009RCPY8", "B0057RCFQS", "B000P0J09W", "B001CCSI2W", "B00003CXC5", "B0087F7VSY", "B00003CXC3", "B001AGXEAG", "B00DQC2FPM", "B000FO0AA6", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B000065V42", "B006VRRGNK", "B000E33W26", "B000FO0A9W", "B00008G8LM", "B00IZZDWKM", "B001AEF6C2", "B00003CXCT", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B0006OBPTA", "B00007AJGH", "6305428050", "B0001I562I", "B008X905AK", "B000FS9UKI", "B0008JIJ2E", "B000YGDNPO", "0800141601", "B00AEFY0F2", "0792844890", "B00003CX5P", "B00HFFE8HE", "B0084IHVUC", "B0002WZTOI", "B00ALTQRRK", "0783225547", "B000MGBLTQ", "B0087ZG7HK", "B001DJLD2G", "B001QB9H10", "B0015NORDW", "B000P0J06U", "B009JBWOU0", "B00028HBES", "B000OVLBF8", "B002I9Z8I0", "B003UESJF6", "B00AEFXDO6", "0783231644", "B0000VCZKM", "B0000VCZK2", "B0014Z4OMU", "B00005T7HZ", "B000274T94", "B00006HBUJ", "B0060FXDCG", "B00005JNTU", "B00005JLXH", "B008H6GHEM", "B000QQLVPQ", "B006U1JD5G", "B0001Z3TXE", "B000ASATYY", "B000JYW5BE", "B00000JPH6", "B00005TN8K", "B00005PJ6N", "B000Y11B7Q", "B00008G8M5", "B007SPPANM", "B0012RWQJ8", "B0019HQICW", "B000BPL2GK", "B00005JPD0", "B00AGKHBQK", "B00006ZXSL", "0800177991", "B0067EKYAY"], "bought_together": ["B001E75QH0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001LXIDVI", "B008JFUPFI", "B009JBWOU0", "B0057RCFQS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 65851}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 34.5, "brand": "MCA", "asin": "B00006AL1D", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CRSVV0WEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)"}
{"description": "The James Bond Collection, Vol. 1collects the same feature-packed DVDs that appeared inprevious Bond boxes, but in a new combination of titles, one with a decidedly golden gleam. In 1962 Sean Connery defined the cinematic James Bond as a tough, charming, and thoroughly professional cold war spy with a license to kill in the lean, hard-edgedDr. No. With Ursula Andress (as the original Bond girl Honeychile Ryder, who makes her entrance in a bikini), Bond battles a renegade supervillain with little more than his wits, his cunning, and his Walther PPK. InGoldfinger(1964) Connery's steely presence helped forge the formula of tongue-in-cheek wit, wondrous secret agent toys created by Q, and megalomaniac supervillains bent on world destruction.Roger Moore brought a light tone and a suave assurance to the series, and inThe Man with the Golden Gun(1974), he battles million-dollar assassin Christopher Lee, one of Bond's most magnetic adversaries.The Spy Who Loved Me(1977), perhaps Moore's finest hour, is a return to the extravagant set pieces and cold war thrills of Connery's pictures and introduces Richard Kiel's steel-dentured Jaws to the series. Timothy Dalton made his second and final appearance as Bond inLicence to Kill(1989), the toughest of the Bond films since Connery's early efforts. Though not a fan favorite, it's a sleek, solid adventure with an edge missing from the Moore pictures.Pierce Brosnan is the latest to take on the 007 mantle, combining the best of Connery's cool and Moore's humor.GoldenEye(1995) is a grand globetrotting adventure with lovely Bond girls and a tough new M (Judy Dench).Tomorrow Never Dies(1997) doesn't recapture that magic mix of action, gadgetry, and romance, but does feature the first Bond girl to match 007 blow for blow: Hong Kong action superstar Michelle Yeoh. The DVD editions of the films each feature audio commentary tracks by the director and key members of the crew, making-of documentaries, and a host of stills, TV spots, and trailers.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000BYRO7", "B0000BYRO9", "B001PPLIEG", "B00AQSN7HE", "B007REV4T8", "B00004WEJZ", "B00AZFECL8", "B000ICM5V2", "B000NIBUR6", "B000RPCK1K", "B001R10BN2", "B00000BCPF", "B000M53GNG", "B00000BLFI", "B000RPCK24", "B000RPCK1A", "B000NIBURG", "B000ICM5VC", "B000NDEXPM", "B0045HCJFS", "B00005JL0I", "B000RPCK1U", "B000M53GLS", "B000NIBURQ", "B000M53GN6", "B009PN18R2", "B008YAPQX4", "B000NDEXPC", "B000E6ESEY", "B00EYA6VD2", "B000RPCK0Q", "B00AZMFJYA", "B009PN3OD8", "B009A87ZQU", "B007REV4YI", "B002GHHHME", "B0050FXDDQ", "B00004RG62", "B00DH34G9S", "B001EDVNNU", "B00388PK7O", "B00003CXQA", "B00JA3RVG4", "B002I9Z8I0", "6304711891", "B001F12J0C", "B00G7QQ0RS", "B005PTYP70", "B000M53GMW", "B000NIBUS0", "1618930311", "B00005JKBC", "B004SIP95G"], "bought_together": ["B0000BYRO7", "B0000BYRO9"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B006U1JD5G", "B007REV4T8", "B008YAPQX4", "B0000BYRO9"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 46258}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 56.99, "brand": "", "asin": "B00006BH8G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X7K7WRN3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The James Bond Collection, Vol. 1 (Special Edition)"}
{"description": "The new short film \"Scrat's Missing Adventure: Gone Nutty\" showcases the well-timed animation--strongly influenced by Chuck Jones's Road Runner-Wile E. Coyote shorts--that made that frantic little character so effective as a comic foil. It's interesting to compare the Oscar&#xAE;-winning short \"Bunny\" withIce Age. The viewer can see the Blue Sky artists developing the more angular and less detailed look that's become the studio's signature. Like Sid the Sloth, the title character in \"Bunny\" suggests a slightly frayed walk-around figure from a theme park; the texture of her coat anticipates the old-chenille-bathrobe look of Manny the Mammoth's pelt. The clips in different languages, trailers, directors' commentary, and making-of features feel rather standard, but listening to John Leguizamo experiment with different voices before settling on the exaggerated lisp for Sid offers an unusual and funny insight into the development of an animated character.--Charles Solomon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000GUJZ00", "B001GCUNWQ", "B005LAIISA", "B000MV9026", "B004HO6I4M", "B000AY74OG", "B001DPHDCY", "B002WJI2QQ", "B0006JMLRK", "B0012EM5D8", "B0000AOX0O", "B00CWM58WY", "B005QODEEE", "B0039N74CW", "B00005JNQS", "B00003CXJ4", "0783231474", "B001ECQ75A", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B0000640SC", "B001NCDFTW", "B004EPZ034", "B000M343BC", "B000RMJ4F8", "B0042U94UQ", "B00007LVCM", "B00AFEX83C", "B0000VV4W2", "B000UVKGPI", "B00005JMQZ", "B0013FSWT2", "B00G5G7EXY", "B008JFUQ16", "B002ZG97YM", "6305161887", "B0030IIZ4M", "B00005JNS0", "B0013FSL3E", "B005SDUV4E", "B00CHVJODE", "B00EBBGLFC", "B00EV1YZ96", "B001GCUO7A", "B005LAIHW2", "B00E9ZATJO", "B000056H26", "B00029LO0Y", "B000VBJEEG", "B006JD48LO", "B00F522C7C", "B005LAIH4A", "B003H9M1Q2", "B004G600A4", "B00005JM7T", "B005F96UJ6", "B00365F6I2", "B008YWY0HK", "B0030IIYYS", "B00JK531ES", "B00947N6D8", "B001OMU6UM", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B001ILFUD2", "B00000JL8E", "B000L22SG6", "B001GCUNW6", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00009YXAW", "B004LWZW7Y", "B001HN6918", "B003ZHVJGO", "B000065V42", "B00HLTD2OE", "B00275EHJG", "B00E00OGE2", "B00003CXB4", "B001HN6922", "B001U3D88M", "B002ZG9904", "B000H7JCK0", "B000AAF1TU", "B00005JMFH", "B001LPWGFA", "B008NNY9QW", "B009PPO78W", "B000LPS2VI", "B003E66Y84", "B00157OICI", "B003UESJF6", "B00003CXG7", "B001O5LVPI", "B000EQ5UHS", "B00028HBES", "B0000VCZKW", "B000ROAK2W", "B00ALMNCLQ", "B00I6JOD2S", "B000YERP2S", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00H5NY7NG"], "bought_together": ["B004HO6I4M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004HO6I4M", "B005LAIISA", "B00IEXX4KS", "B000MV9026"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 126280}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.07, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B00006CXHU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5150B79E6SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ice Age (2-Disc Special Edition)"}

{"description": "From Academy-Award&#xAE; winning director and producer Oliver Stone comes this riveting true story...March 30, 1981. An insane and obsessive young man named John Hinckley Jr. attemps to kill U.S. President Ronald Reagan.

But only those behind the scenes in the corridors of power know that this is more than a fight to save one man. With the Soviet Union poised to invade Poland and the possibility of a total nuclear war looming, someone must take control of the impending crisis.

{"description": "The screwball comedy was the definitive genre of the Depression, but as America edged toward war in the early '40s, it suffered some strange and wonderful mutations--none stranger thanThe Talk of the Town, directed by George Stevens from a script by novelist Irwin Shaw and frequent Capra collaborator (and future blacklist victim) Sidney Buchman. Cary Grant, awkwardly cast, is a small-town political agitator who is framed for the burning of a local factory; he takes refuge in the attic of a country cottage that landlady Jean Arthur is preparing to rent out to a celebrated law professor (silver-tongued Ronald Colman, perhaps the only actor in Hollywood who could make Grant look like a proletarian). Stevens, suspended between his light '30s style (Swing Time) and his heavy postwar manner (A Place in the Sun), struggles to balance a charming, surprisingly suspenseful romantic triangle with the heavy, debating-society tone of the screenplay, which pits Grant, the representative of a compassionate, emotional sense of justice, against the cool, abstract application of the law advocated by Colman. Caught between these two highly verbal characters, Jean Arthur doesn't have much to do but be adorable and provide the occasional quizzical reaction shot--two things she does with exquisite skill. Stevens and Arthur teamed up again one year later for another strange-bedfellows farce, the marvelousThe More the Merrier; in 1953 Arthur made her final film appearance in Stevens'sShane.--Dave Kehr", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002XNT08", "B0012GVMIA", "B00000JRW5", "B00B27WTBI", "B0000DD780", "B000085EFE", "B001GLX6US", "B003ZW9H68", "B0024FAG1C", "B0006B2AA6", "B000059ZTM", "B0012GVMIK", "B0001WTWS8", "B004P8R9OS", "B000ION7AI", "B0024FAG1M", "B008D19ZPY", "B00008ZZ7B", "B00KIZY3XW", "B002BZX0JK", "B001BSBBDK", "B002EAYE7Y", "B001GLX6TY", "B00008MTYC", "B0009HLD3C", "B0058K5SD6", "6305416222", "B0006H32DY", "B008D1Q1VU", "B002C4N9BE", "B0000A0DTV", "B000GRUQL0", "B000KJU13C", "B0000DD77V", "B0000714AT", "B00BGGITZU", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B0045HCJHG", "B0047BXR1C", "B00347AIMG", "B000HA4WS4", "B0000DD77W", "B002GSXKQA", "B00FEFOK4I", "B006TTC5A4", "B002EAYDWK", "B0001WTWRY", "B000KX0IOU", "B0012GVMIU", "B004D9ADD8", "B000N3T0FK", "B00C3ALLFS", "B000EU1Q1S", "B004GJYR7I", "B00A1AU6ZI", "B001GUYAZY", "B005ZVIN30", "B004193UCQ", "B00011D1OU", "B0045HCJQW", "B001D8W7EK", "B00AEBB97S", "B00K6D1QV8", "B00K8CQ1Q2", "B000CCW2SY", "B002KGREFQ", "B003IPD97U", "B000E6ESWG", "B007XTDWQA", "B004XQO8XC", "B00EOBB636", "B000054OT4", "B0090XPGUM", "B000CC1TNI", "B0047O2FPI", "B00KIZY0EE", "B00C3ALLSA", "B00CVB6XZM", "B000067IVZ", "B00DZP1BVO", "B002EAYDTS", "B00J2TE3DU", "B0043GAT5I", "B000054OUJ", "B0080QOK66", "B000TGKWPS", "B0006TPDSO", "B00E3HUVWI", "B00DZFKN54", "B004DK3G3G", "B00EOBB866", "B00BY8DAAE", "B00074DY0W", "B001D8W7F4", "B00KIZY2QA", "B0001WTWVU", "B00006RCO2", "B00012FXJ0", "B000O599MG", "B000F7CMS6"], "bought_together": ["B0002XNT08", "B0012GVMIA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002XNT08", "B000085EFE", "B0012GVMIA", "B00B27WTBI"]}, "price": 10.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30736}, "asin": "B000083C8K", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QFFZPFMBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Talk of the Town"}

{"description": "S.W.A.T.crams onto a single DVD two commentary tracks, deleted scenes, featurettes, and excellent technical specs, including an exciting sound mix.  The first commentary track is a combination of informative but subdued remarks by director Clark Johnson spliced with a track by Samuel L. Jackson and five other actors (but not Colin Farrell) together.  The comments by the actors are infrequent, raucous, and forgettable. There's also a commentary track by four of the writers, who discuss how they were writingS.W.A.T.when the North Hollywood shootout (on which the opening scene is based) took place, and what writers think about actors who improvise. The making-of featurette gives plenty of exposure and credit to the real-life S.W.A.T. officers who helped with the film, and a featurette on the original TV series is interesting, even though it's basically an advertisement for theDVD set.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004H2P6II", "B00005JLX2", "B0015LPRZQ", "B0025KVKDO", "B00005JLQN", "B0001XAQ9Q", "B00005JL3K", "B000J4QWMC", "B000A2X3MU", "B002ZG99N6", "B00275EGWY", "B000FJGR76", "B002AT8K9W", "B000KX0HFK", "B00AEBB86A", "B004LGGXG4", "B001MZ5W3M", "B000G5SILC", "B001BP4K22", "B00004Z1FX", "B000QUCRB4", "B000HC2M2K", "6304806434", "B00003CXNY", "B000TJBN80", "B000KLQUSU", "0790736411", "B00HLTD3ZW", "1558908315", "B000VG66XS", "B00016MSV2", "B002ZG994U", "B004V8W52S", "B008E70EES", "B000065U1N", "B000X1Z0C4", "B0000VJG72", "B00004Z4WR", "B0007W7I4W", "0767803434", "B0010YVCB6", "B00005JKTP", "B0034G4OUO", "B00005QW6V", "6304698747", "B000K7UBSO", "B000FFL2G6", "B000F8DV1M", "B004EPYZUS", "B000274T94", "B00004STUL", "B002VWNIEA", "B000095WW8", "B00000FZL2", "B00ECXJBN8", "B0000B1OFL", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00562I40K", "0792835727", "B0009KA7XG", "B000BTITKS", "B000KGGIZK", "B00009ZPUA", "B0002IQMAM", "B0058ZPNBI", "B005LAIIPS", "B001QB9H10", "B001O5LVVC", "B001UV4XGA", "B004HO6HWA", "B00BUC4TJ0", "B00BEIYHO2", "B004P3ENLA", "B0006GANOQ", "B0019EXZY4", "B00000G3PA", "B0013J55B6", "B002GHHHL0", "B00004STDN", "B0009DWL8W", "6304711891", "B0034G4ORC", "B003Y5H5FG", "B00BB67UNW", "B001ILHY1I", "B004EPYZQC", "B002AT8KA6", "0790732149", "B00260HH2G", "B000CQLZ8S", "B005LAIH2C", "B002ZG97RE", "B003M987QK", "B000A0GP0Y", "B000KX0HIW", "B00009L1TA", "B00005V9I6", "0783240295", "B000P0J0BK", "B0000542CK"], "bought_together": ["B004H2P6II"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00008YLVB", "B000M341QE", "B005CFBYW6", "B003Q6D2B4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 24979}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.98, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00008EYA5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BEAR8WT7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "S.W.A.T.

{"description": "Elijah Wood has one of his first post-Frodoleading roles in this mild-mannered comedy (the title of which wasTry Seventeenin its film festival showings). He's a 17-year-old college dropout who moves into a funky old apartment building and becomes intrigued by his wacky neighbors. Mandy Moore plays the self-absorbed actress across the hall, andRun Lola Rungoddess Franka Potente is a cranky photographer. The movie has a few surprises (the casting seems to suggest a teenybopper romance for Wood and Moore, but not so fast), although the energy level rarely perks up and it's pretty thin on actual narrative happenings. Wood's tendency toward fantasy is an especially tired device. A furtive sense of humor, plus the big adoring closeups of the highly photogenic leading ladies, provides the low-key interest. Trivia:  Elizabeth Perkins plays the hero's irresponsible mom; she was also Elijah Wood's mother inAvalon.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00104AYFQ", "B0000CDRVU", "B000P0J08S", "B0013527IE", "B0016MJ6WO", "B0002OXRSG", "B002DQSKMY", "B00561BNI6", "B00DPUB5EW", "B0010DM3R4", "B000FBNG1O", "B004SEUJ9Q", "B0000524E4", "B002AS463W", "B000XJD35M", "B000GPPNMY", "B00005JPQE", "B0006J28KK", "B000OCZA04", "B00BEIYGQG", "B000F7CEBG", "B0010X8NNM", "B001BN4WL8", "B000083C6R", "B000CQQIDA", "B002TZS5HE", "B003B2UJVE", "B000VS6LSG", "B0002V7SPM"], "bought_together": ["B00104AYFQ", "B0000CDRVU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00104AYFQ", "B0000CDRVU", "B000P0J08S", "B00005JPQE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 136918}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.54, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0000AKCJO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z1002KZSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "All I Want"}

{"description": "A movie doesn't win seven Oscars for nothing. A glowing Greer Garson (Best Actress) commands the screen as Mrs. Miniver, a middle-class British housewife whose strength holds her family together as World War II literally hits their home. Walter Pidgeon as her architect husband seems to be the prototype for future TV dads in this affecting portrait of love--familial and romantic--during war. But the relationship between Mrs. Miniver's college-age son (Richard Ney) and the upper-crust Carol (Best Supporting Actress Teresa Wright) is filled with inherent drama--as the war speeds up their young love, it also has the potential to doom it. The 1942 film, which also won for Best Picture and Best Director, is filled with colorful characters, snappy dialogue, and sensational plot twists. Although you spend much of the movie dreading that one of the Minivers will become a casualty of war, when it finally happens, it's not what you anticipated. Exactly what you'd expect from a legendary film that lives up to its billing.--Valerie J.

{"description": "It sounds likeLove Story, but with an intriguing twist. 23-year-old wife and mom Sarah Polley has spent her entire life sacrificing for others and living on the economic fringe; when she discovers she has only a few months to live, she resolves to keep the news secret. In her remaining time, she plots a course for various unfinished plans and deferred dreams:  write a journal, leave future messages for her kids, make a stranger (Mark Ruffalo) fall in love with her. Obviously, the danger of sentimentality lurks in director Isabel Coixet's concept, and the film does have a few soggy moments. Some critics lost patience with the main character's seeming selfishness (a good post-movie conversation starter). Yet there is something powerful in her insistence on claiming a small piece of existence exclusively for herself.

{"description": "Averyatypical mother-daughter relationship is at the center ofGilmore Girls, a comedy-drama that immediately set itself apart from the herd with smarter-than-smart dialogue and an endearing mix of whimsical comedy and family drama. Set in the Capra-esque burg of Stars Hollow, where everybody knows everyone and eccentrics abound,Gilmore Girlswas less a mother-daughter show and more of a screwball buddy comedy in which the two buddies happened to be parent and child. Pregnant at 16, Lorelai (Lauren Graham) left her rich parents to bring up her daughter Rory (Alexis Bledel) on her own terms; when Rory herself turns 16, Lorelai wants to send her academically gifted daughter to the prestigious Chilton school. The catch is, Lorelai can't afford it on her own, and rather than let Rory go without, the elder Gilmore girl brokers an uneasy truce with her parents (Edward Herrmann and Kelly Bishop), who finally get a chance to bond with their granddaughter while financing her education.It sounds like a premise potentially fraught with angst and trauma, but in realityGilmore Girlswas one of the freshest, airiest, most enjoyable shows to air on the perpetually melodramatic WB network, critically praised once viewers got hooked on its unique brand of humor. Rory's growing-up adventures, including her acclimation to snooty Chilton and romance with townie dreamboat Dean (Jared Padalecki), gave the show a teen-friendly feel, butGilmore Girlswas anchored in the adult by the luminous Graham, a brilliant comedic leading lady who could turn dramatic on a dime and never break stride. The show's hallmark was its rat-a-tat, whipsmart dialogue, delivered perfectly by Graham and Bledgel, as well as a host of wacky supporting characters who would go on to become invaluable cast members. The first season allowed the show--and its lead actresses--to bloom gracefully and establish a deep, humorous rapport that lent itself perfectly to weekly travails both comedic and dramatic.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002BJGYU8", "B002BJGYTY", "B002BJGYTO", "B002BJGYV2", "B000G1R4SY", "B000N6TYLW", "B00B1LKXV8", "B00008AOX3", "B0002I838Q", "B00006JIBS", "B0006Q93BA", "B000HWZ4IE", "B009MA9ZW8", "B00005JNEQ", "B0006FFRBG", "B0000E5NPY", "B004GJYRFA", "B0077PTWY6", "B00B5AAW52", "B003TY2SWC", "B004STBF2G", "B0009W5J4Q", "B001FB4VZ8", "B00A8KJN8M", "B000B5XOW0", "B00005JO9J", "B004STBF5S", "B00004RFCM", "B0002V7TZQ", "B0009K7QZ8", "B0009JE57G", "B000GYI32M", "B000XS3EFW", "B003SNJO5S", "B000YAA2SQ", "B004STBFPS", "B008FTX6MM", "B00005JLFT", "B00382S9UA", "0783235070", "B000R9YLKY", "B001ECDVK4", "B00006ZXSK", "B00AOCZOLO", "B000AYELVA", "B00684J49U", "B000NA2BEU", "B00AEBBAEK", "0061733512", "B009LDD4BO", "B005IA9JQ8", "B005IA9JQI", "B00AEFYM2S", "B009LDCXNY", "B005IA9JRM", "B00EIXWMII", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00008YGRU", "B002VWNIAY", "B002ZG988M", "1451666179", "B000NDEXK2", "B002JVWQSW", "B000W91RUG", "B004LWZW4M", "014242417X"], "bought_together": ["B002BJGYU8", "B002BJGYTY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B006WZIAHM", "B00B5AAW52", "B002BJGYTY", "B00B1LKXV8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9162}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.95, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001CCXZW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51oCGP2ik5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gilmore Girls: Season 1"}

{"description": "The turbulent lives of two handsome and high-priced Miami plastic surgeons may be one of the more unusual premises for a television series, but the FX Channel'sNip/Tuckcombines sudsy sex and biting wit with the emotional quandaries involved in body modification in a way that makes for an engrossing--and occasionally gross--hourlong drama. The show benefits greatly from its two leads--Dylan Walsh as the troubled \"good\" surgeon and Julian McMahon as his predatory (but equally troubled) \"bad\" partner--as well as Joely Richardson as Walsh's wife and Roma Maffia as the surgeons' nurse. IfNip/Tuckdoes have a stumbling point, it's in its occasionally glib dialogue (series creator Ryan Murphy was a writer for the verbally flashy high school seriesPopular), which can clash with an episode's more dramatic and poignant moments. The show also doesn't shy away from showing the more gruesome aspects of plastic surgery, but viewers can often see more stomach-churning images on the top-ratedCSI. But the strength of the performances and the originality of the premise make these rough spots manageable for viewers looking for an interesting spin on the usual \"doctor show.\" The five-DVD set offers an extended version of the pilot and all 12 episodes of the first season as well as a trio of documentaries (one on the show itself, another on its special effects, and a third, \"Realistic Expectations,\" on real-life plastic surgeons). A gag reel (amusingly titled \"Severed Parts\"), a selection of deleted scenes for most episodes, and a music video for the title theme (\"A Perfect Lie\" by the Engine Room) round out the box.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009IW88K", "B000FUTVLO", "B000QUTTPG", "B0013FSL16", "B003CN5SAY", "B001PQZYQI", "B000QUTTPQ", "1419811118", "B00079FUI6", "B0008JIJ1A", "B001QE99AQ", "B000ENUYGI", "B000OIOOVE", "B000Q6GUKW", "B00166647K", "B00HT851LO", "B000FFJYE8", "B00005JO9J", "B000FIMG4U", "B000FVQLIO", "B000FIMG5Y", "B00008AOX3", "B000QUTTQ0", "B00005JNOG", "B000FIMG68", "B00JF5GAZA", "B002WQ799U", "B000QDLSR0", "B0018CWEZI", "B000P6YNTI", "B0012CJQY6", "B00166UFSY", "B0024FAR5M", "B0036TGTF2", "B000P6YNSE", "B0012CJQYG", "B000FKO3GW", "B00005JPII", "B001AQBGM4", "B000P6YNSO", "B001FB4W0W", "B0007QS324", "B000V86OKG", "B001B7CNZ6", "B002N5N5QQ", "B000YABIQ6", "B000FUTVPA", "B0002RQ3MK", "B000NDEXK2", "B000Q6GUW0", "B001B7N4WM", "B002WQ79A4", "B0018CWEYY", "B000YW8RPE", "B003L77GRO", "B0015ABRE2", "B000R9YLKY", "B00005JNEQ", "B001VPJYZK", "B0012CJQZA", "B0002V7TZQ", "B0012CJQZ0", "B003F3NDP8", "B001LM64UG", "B0002MPQRS", "B0012CJQYQ", "B0018CWEYO", "B0000E5NPY", "B000R7HRRA", "B0011NVCAM", "B0002234R2", "B001ILFUAA", "B003CPPY5G", "B000P12LWY", "B00004RFCM", "B001MVWRNE", "B00IYMSMTM", "B000RW3VDE", "B002GHHHL0", "B002AMVED8", "B000E3L7F0", "B00168ML34", "B0055SNHQG", "B000FS9MY2", "B0013ZGN9I", "B00009Y3RW", "B005FISBTO", "B0006IUE16", "B000HT3P6U", "B0009K7QZ8", "B000G1R4TS", "B000JLTRJK", "B008H6GHF6", "B000B8IA08", "B00005JMMT", "B003LXM1PK", "B001CY5N1E", "B002N5N5M0", "B000MGBSI0", "B000G6BL88"], "bought_together": ["B0009IW88K", "B000FUTVLO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000QUTTPG", "B001PQZYQI", "B0013FSL16", "B003XWEQ8E"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 11266}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 12.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001O3YLM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2B5PfPHCXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Nip/Tuck: Season 1"}

{"description": "Challenge of the Super Friendsis the ultimate animated all-star contest of good versus evil.  The originalSuper Friends(running from 1973 to 1977--Wonder Twins and Gleek anyone??) was made up of the greatest DC Comics superheroes fighting together to uphold justice for all mankind. Overall, it was a pretty good show, but getting stale very fast. In 1978, the superhero animation bar was raised high when the first (and only) season ofChallenge of the Super Friendshit the Saturday morning circuit. Immediately these 16 episodes made up the best thatSuper Friendshad to offer for one reason alone: the creation of the Legion of Doom, banding together the 13 most sinister villains of all-time from remote galaxies. Led by the sinister genius of Lex Luthor, the Legion of Doom was dedicated to take over the universe, and only the Super Friends, led by Superman, Wonder Woman and the Dynamic Duo, dared to challenge this intergalactic threat and bring them to justice.There is no denying that animated superhero shows have come a long way sinceSuper Friends. TheChallenge of the Super Friendsis very '70s in presentation, riddled with inconsistencies and drawing mistakes, and allowing heroes to fly even if they couldn't fly in the comics. However, there is no denying the staying power of the stories, its concept, the superheroes/villains pairing and its overall charm.  Included in this set are a couple of nice features, particularly the superheroes/villains biographies, each with their own mini-video. There is also a good, brief documentary of today's comic book and TV show creators reflecting on their impressions ofChallenge of the Super Friendsand its influence on their careers. If you want to take a trip down memory lane to the Hall of Justice or the swamps of the Hall of Doom, you will not be disappointed by this set.--Rob Bracco", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007XFZMS", "B001HRS8HW", "B000W2C28Y", "B003F3NE4S", "B000PC8AKK", "B000TSTEJG", "B0027WNRV8", "B002S3Y1LQ", "B00CREAO9O", "B000087F7F", "B00CM0DIT6", "B00009AV9Z", "B00DVKKWFE", "B0029WGIDK", "B000OPODNG", "B00CL3JBI6", "B000OPODNQ", "B000TSTEMS", "B00HMOW9YM", "B00LT1JHLW", "B0018BDDFE", "B00HMOWA0A", "B002K0WBDM", "B00466X70Y", "B000OY9V7K", "B0001I55O2", "B000LE17A2", "B00553KAK2", "B000GYI33Q", "B000OY9V7A", "B00FNR9ZN8", "B002DH20Q0", "B003M8NGLC", "B001OD8E4G", "B0007US7CQ", "B00L9SXSCE", "B000FI9OEU", "0062210033", "B00E44EZHC", "B0002MFGDW", "B000AOEMU0", "B00I40K6RU", "B003L7DK88", "B000F4RH8O", "B005SH6482", "B003VADST6", "B000B7QCGS", "B000ZBEOHY", "B0002ZMHX6", "B00125WAY6", "B003CS28UC", "B00FFFUZ46", "B000RPD0DM", "B002T9H2MY", "B0049IHWYG", "B000EU1Q2M", "B004AUCDK6", "B004K5RN2O", "B00I099JZK", "B001OBBR38", "B00KH57U60", "B000AOEMUA", "B000FI9OEK", "B00IED43X0", "006221005X", "B004XKVRBE", "B00BH418RW", "B001GF8WRG", "B0001MZ7J6", "B007KW5MOU", "B000B7QCHC", "B002A5EBLW", "6305943389", "B000CEXFZQ", "B000F4RH8E", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B00GJ6HQDI", "B004P8R9S4", "B000WC38NM", "B0009IW8AI", "B00157OI9Q", "B0007QS31A", "B0036EH3XO", "B0018TNMCA", "B00IGVJH0E", "B001BN25VW", "B0007XG43W", "B000CSTK3S", "B00C16YYW6", "B009M4KT3I", "B007RG8ZF2", "B0001CNQVM", "B0016OM3WC", "B000CEXFZ6", "B001B8TKFG", "B005EKWZD6", "B00HETMEZE", "B001SGN1JM", "B0007939Q6", "B000FZETS4"], "bought_together": ["B0007XFZMS", "B000W2C28Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00CREAO9O", "B0007XFZMS", "B00DVKKWFE", "B002S3Y1LQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14952}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.2, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00023E88U", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61j80kWRKUL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Challenge of the Super Friends: The First Season"}
{"description": "Millenniummarked the second major television series created by Chris Carter, who'd already made his name as the brains behindThe X-Files. And, like its predecessor, it shares a lot of the same themes--it's a crime thriller that gradually unfolds into a grand conspiracy involving the government and the fate of the entire world.Agent Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) is a former FBI agent who has transplanted his family from Washington, D.C. to Seattle, after suffering something of a breakdown. He's an expert criminal profiler--arguably the best, thanks to his ability to \"see\" into the minds of killers--and he fears for the safety of his wife and young daughter. In Seattle, he joins the mysterious Millennium Group, an agency of freelance crime-busters who investigate particularly brutal crimes. As a result,Millenniumis downright bleak viewing, as Black jumps from horrific slaying to horrific slaying. Moreover, there's a growing sense of unease about the workings of the Millennium Group, so that in typical Chris Carter fashion, you don't know who to trust. With its pre-Y2K angst and overwhelming darkness, as well as its general humorlessness,Millenniumhasn't dated as well asThe X-Files. Still, thanks to Carter's vision and Henriksen's compelling take on the tortured Black, it's difficult not to get hooked.--Ted Kord", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000667HBS", "B0009X76XW", "B0006UEVUE", "B000EXDS3E", "B000EXDS3Y", "B000BOH98G", "B000BOH986", "B000BOH990", "B000CNE0T2", "B000CNE0SS", "B000EXDS34", "B000CNE0TC", "B0007X7044", "B001FACH7S", "B000O77SMW", "B000FOPPBA", "B000ATQYXI", "1480277460", "B000AM6OQ2", "B0000AOX0A", "B001G7PSZI", "B00028HOMM", "B00JQYV0B4", "B0056GLNQI", "B00E0KWBAI", "B001MVWRMU", "B0081QF6Q8", "B005HMHPE0", "B0001O3YD0", "B0015ET3YO", "0060575913", "0143039911", "B004X60QE2", "B0006UEVTK", "B00022FWEU", "B0013DZNAA", "B00HUPC5X8", "B00005JM67", "B000BCCAEQ", "B000056BP1", "B00E5S2HGS", "0060083972", "B00FUABG1C", "B004YPED14", "B001MVWRN4", "B001RHGRTS", "B00BTFK01Y", "B00B5ARKC0", "6304698763", "0141182342", "B0009NZ2RE", "B0013ZGN9I", "B00062IDEW", "B001CY5N00", "B0000694XX", "B0007N1AM2", "B001MVWRNE", "B000N3T0EG", "B00004YC1W", "B000FJH5M2", "B000HT3P60", "B000EOTTS6", "B001MVWRNO", "B00008NV4G", "B0000AOX09", "B0053O8A46", "B00A8KJN8M", "B005S9EJ8W", "B000B5XOVQ", "B003UD7J26", "B001AZIRZO", "B005LAIHXQ", "B0002V7OI8", "B0009W5J4Q", "B0055SNHQG", "B002AS464Q", "B001715A92", "B0051GOB2G", "B000MV8ABS", "B00AATGDUC"], "bought_together": ["B000667HBS", "B0009X76XW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001CY5N00", "B0006UEVUE", "B000667HBS", "B001FACH7S"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 75357}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 20.65, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B000244E2O", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VH96EF60L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Millennium - The Complete First Season"}
{"description": "There really can't be enough movies adapted from Elmore Leonard novels;  his sinuous storylines and fluid, surprising dialogue give any movie a  boost from the start. InThe Big Bounce, laid-back Owen Wilson  (The Royal Tenenbaums,Shanghai Noon) plays Jack, a  small-time crook trying to lead an easier life in Hawaii. Trouble is, he  can't keep out of trouble, and when he does stay clean, trouble finds  him--in this case, in the bikini-clad form of Nancy (Sara Foster), the  mistress of a local developer who gets turned on by the whiff criminal  activity. She lures Jack into a scheme that ultimately involves a solid  cast including Morgan Freeman, Charlie Sheen, Gary Sinise, Bebe Neuwirth,  Willie Nelson, and more. Foster doesn't bring much to movie besides her  alarmingly sculpted body and the ending peters out, butThe Big  Bouncehas enough snap and crackle that you don't miss the pop.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001U0HB5Q", "B0008FXT1Y", "B0000CDLBB", "B00JQF7ZR6", "B000085EFK", "B00007GZRI", "0783229402", "B00024JC4E", "0792833279", "B000NQRR34", "B0000714BV", "B000Y11BC6", "B00466H3EK", "B000A0GP0Y", "B00009V2J7", "B000ICM5X0", "B0002V7TMY", "B000BKVQS4", "B00005JMWP", "B00HF98SPS", "B0007OY2OE", "B00538MG6A", "B003EYVXXC", "B00029NMRM", "B00022XE6S", "B0013FW05Y", "B0033PSH9U", "B004XFZ4HC", "B003AWRMA6", "B00AFQSYFM", "B00005JLH0", "B000OPOAPC", "B0007KZQAM", "6305308837", "B00G7QPUII", "B00BTYU3W6", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B000O77SF4", "B0002W4UDE", "B00005JLRQ", "B00DVD5SBE", "B002NO4ISG", "B0012KJ0DK", "B003Y5H524", "B0000A2ZU3", "B000069I1H", "B00005UQ9T", "B000XA5K48", "B000065V3I", "B000SM6FLI", "B004B93RGK", "B000067IZ3", "B00008CMR1", "B007EQR0D8", "B0009RCPUW", "B004U7MR14", "B003Q6D200", "B001JIE7JC", "B000QUCRB4", "B004SEUJOQ", "B00IXD2MMU", "B000GRUMRS", "B000244GCW", "0062191357", "B008E70EES", "B000FKO5QK", "B000K7VHNW", "B00HEPC0TS", "B000FFJYBG", "0783228007", "B00J49R0ZQ", "B0007OCG56", "B00008K7AO", "B00AEFXVOI", "B002ZG97O2", "B001HVZO7A", "B00GICP7UW", "B000056PMU", "B008A6QC08", "B001RHGRT8", "B004EPZ084", "B00DZP1C2W", "B003L20IG0", "B000UNYK4E", "B00005JMX6", "B002GIBVVQ", "B000BYA4IS", "B00005JMW7", "B00008G6E8", "B000JYW5BE", "B000B8GT92", "B000K7UBSO", "B00BLF9FYA", "6305213283", "6305922675", "B0051MKNRC", "B004EPYZP8", "B00005JMIJ", "B00AEFZE48"], "bought_together": ["B001U0HB5Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004LWZWBU", "B00009V2J7", "0783229402", "B000BKVQS4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 45294}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00024JC30", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GF3EWRDKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Big Bounce (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Having scored a critical triumph withMean Streets, Martin Scorsese acceptedAlice Doesn't Live Here Anymoreas his first big-studio assignment, proving his versatility and further advancing his promising career. Hot offThe Exorcistwith her choice of projects at Warner Brothers, Ellen Burstyn sought a hot young talent (Scorsese was recommended by Francis Coppola) to direct Robert Getchell's fine, sensitive screenplay about Alice Wyatt, a newly-widowed 35-year-old lounge singer with a bratty 12-year-old son (Alfred Lutter) and a very uncertain future. Her pursuit of broken dreams lands her a waitressing job in an Arizona diner, where she befriends foul-mouthed Flo (Diane Ladd) and meets and falls in love with a divorced farmer (Kris Kristofferson).  With absolute authenticity of emotion and incident,Alice--which earned Burstyn a well-deserved Oscar&#xAE; and features supporting roles for futureTaxi Drivercostars Jodie Foster and Harvey Keitel--conveys a then-timely sense of strength and endurance from a single mother in desperate times. There have been several similar dramas made since 1974, butAlice(which inspired the popular TV sitcomsAliceandFlo) is still the best.

{"description": "Where else but onSouth Parkwill you find irreverent comedy as scathingly hilarious as \"The Passion of the Jew\"? Premiering just one month afterThe Passion of the Christwas released in theaters, this typically outrageous episode tore into Mel Gibson's film with characteristic glee, ruthlessly condemning Gibson's courtship of controversy and depicting Gibson as a raving, greedy, egotistical lunatic (recalling the classicfirst seasonepisode \"Mecha-Streisand\") while promoting a fair-minded appreciation of Christ's teachings over the relentless violence of Gibson's film. Perfectly playing off established character conflicts, the episode pits Mel-worshipping Cartman (who embraces Gibson's alleged anti-Semitism to justify his own homespun Nazi revival) against Kyle, who is traumatized by Gibson's film into feeling guilty about his own Jewish heritage. Never ones to flinch from taboo topics or political correctness, series creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone outdid themselves with this amazingly rapid response to Gibson's film, and it's destined to rank as an all-timeSouth Parkclassic. Likewise, the bonus episodes \"Christian Rock Hard\" (from 2003) and \"Red Hot Catholic Love\" (from 2002) tackle the commercialism of Christian music (as deviously exploited by Cartman) and the news-making controversy of sexual misconduct among Catholic priests, which somehow manages to incorporate a scatological sub-plot about the marvels of \"interorectogestion,\" answering the age-old question of... well, you'll just have to watch to find out.

{"description": "MixThe Great Racewith the slapstick humor ofRoad Runnercartoons and the wildly inventive minds of Hanna-Barbera, and you've got the 1968 animated seriesWacky Races. You remember the lineup: the Slag brothers in the Boulder-Mobile; the Gruesome Twosome in the Creepy Coupe, with a dragon in its belfry; Prof. Pat Pending (ha ha) in the Convert-a-Car; Red Max in the Crimson Haybailer biplane; Sergeant Blast and Private Meekly in the tank-like Army Surplus Special; the Ant Hill Mob in the Bullitt-Proof Bomb; Lazy Luke and Blubber Bear in the Arkansas Chugga-Bug; Rufus Ruffcut and Sawtooth the beaver in the Buzz Wagon; the Belle of the Brickyard, Penelope Pitstop, in the Compact Pussycat; Peter Perfect in the Turbo Terrific; and our hissable villains, Dick Dastardly and his snickering muttering dog, Muttley (\"Sassa frassin'...\") in the Mean Machine.  In each 11-minute episode, the physics-defying cars compete in different areas of the country (\"See-Saw to Arkansas,\" \"Rhode Island Road Race,\" \"The Carlsbad or Bust Bash\"), so evenly matched that any car has a chance to win despite the evil schemes of Dastardly and Muttley, who always seem to come to a Wile E. Coyote-type end (writer Mike Maltese worked on both series). There's never really a plot, but just a string of situations and gags before someone finally crosses the finish line to earn the checkered flag.The DVD set contains all 34 episodes of the series, looking reasonably good.  Four members of the original creative team appear on a commentary track on four different episodes, and their discussion is less interesting for what they have to say aboutWacky Races(\"What was that car again?\") than for their memories of working for Hanna-Barbera (\"we did things off the top of the head\").  There's also pop-up factoids on two episodes, a 20-minute recap of the series' history, and a look at the two spinoff series,Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying MachinesandThe Perils of Penelope Pitstop.  That a relatively short-lived series could inspire two spinoffs, toys, comic books, a CD-ROM game, and other souvenirs is a testament to its ability to capture the Saturday-morning imagination and create a lot of fond memories.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007QS31A", "B0007QS31K", "B000FI9OEU", "B000FI9OEK", "B0002ZMHW2", "B002T9H2MY", "B003VADST6", "B000AOEMUA", "B000AOEMU0", "B000RPD0DM", "B00E44EZHC", "B001QU880M", "B004K5RN2O", "B000ZBEOHY", "B000OY9V7K", "B000OY9V7A", "B007Q49X4C", "B000ZBEOHO", "B002GNOLXQ", "B004P8R9S4", "B004ZRGSDM", "B00553KAK2", "B001RXDM22", "B002GNOLY0", "B001QU880W", "B0029WGIDK", "B0001MZ7IC", "B000MTPA5Y", "B00E1QLEJA", "B004M64QSK", "B0049IHWVY", "B00080ZFZC", "B00466X70Y", "B005SQRYG4", "B000TSTEMS", "B0001MZ7J6", "B007RKFXWQ", "B00961EO24", "B00B4ZN4D0", "B00125WAY6", "B00480OCWA", "B0013D8LPY", "B006JN86Z8", "B00BTHR0VK", "B00480OCWU", "B000P6R9IA", "B00LT1JHLW", "B000GG4XWE", "B000NDI3Q2", "B004VW4VAI", "B008N8A3JE", "B00961ENYI", "B000UAE7PE", "B005EXA87S", "B00BH418RW", "B000P6R9O4", "B000E1JOZ2", "B009H3LNF2", "B000E1JOYS", "B00652FG7O", "B00465I17Y", "B000CEXFZQ", "B00FNR9ZN8", "B0010YO0IS", "B00CGCKEYM", "B000PC1PAW", "B00DY9528Y", "B006WDWBK6", "B009P3J6BM", "B003Q7B7HO", "B0037XPPAW", "B005FQ1ONG", "B00KBES386", "B00553K9R6", "B009P3J5XG", "B0014VPFHW", "B0011XFOIS", "B001B23ED6", "B00465I1BA", "B002S3Y1LQ", "B0007939Q6", "B0001CNQUS", "B009P3J630", "B0007XFZMS", "B00555ZT7Y", "B00HMOW9YM", "B00F3L8OQS", "B002DH20Q0", "B004SD6X7E", "B008BSM18M", "B002H047OG", "B000ZOXDK0", "B005LOBWA2", "B0042I6528", "B003DU50U4", "B001O2UTTK", "B003CS28UC", "B005BYBZQ8", "B005BUA1CQ", "B0002ABU5C"], "bought_together": ["B0007QS31A", "B000FI9OEU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002T9H2MY", "B003VADST6", "B00466X70Y", "B00553KAK2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 33272}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 16.46, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B0002MFGDW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61%2BbBCPhUHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wacky Races - The Complete Series"}

Anderson,Twin Peaks' diminutive backwards-talker) notes in pilot episode \"Milfay,\" directed by Rodrigo Garc&#xED;a (son of Gabriel Garc&#xED;a Marquez), \"To each generation [is] born a creature of light and a creature of darkness.\" With that the story begins. The year is 1934, the setting the Oklahoma dustbowl. In short order, Ben Hawkins (In the Bedroom's Nick Stahl) loses his mother and his home. He's poor, he's alone--he needs a job. So he joins Samson's carnival, en route to the West. Hawkins, naturally, is the good guy. Waiting for him in California is the not so good Brother Justin Crowe (Clancy Brown,The Shawshank Redemption), a fire and brimstone preacher with supernatural powers and a fiercely loyal sister (Amy Madigan). Hawkins, as it turns out, has similar powers....Created by Daniel Knauf (Wolf Lake),Carniv&#xE0;lefeels like David Lynch (weird, slow, occasionally kinky), plays likeAmerican Gothic(Shaun Cassidy's cult series about a good kid and an evil sheriff), and looks like John Ford'sGrapes of Wrath.

They include Sophie (Clea DuVall), who reads fortunes--with her comatose mother's assistance, the vaguely sinister Lodz (Patrick Bauchau), blind absinthe-drinker and mentalist (he can see both the future and the past), and Ruthie (Adrienne Barbeau), snake charmer, strongman's mother, and all-around maternal figure. By the final episode of the season (\"The Day That Was the Day\"), also directed by Garc&#xED;a, one of these characters will be dead.Carniv&#xE0;lewon five richly deserved technical Emmys for its first year, including awards for cinematography and art direction. Like HBO's edgyDeadwood, it's period drama for people who don't normally like period drama.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "The third season ofERhad some of the series' most compelling and wrenching story lines.  John Carter (Noah Wylie) is now an intern, but his surgical dreams continue to be thwarted by Dr. Benton (Eriq La Salle), a frustration shared by fellow student Dennis Gant (Omar Epps).  Benton also torments former lover Jeanie Boulet (Gloria Reuben), who has tested positive for HIV.  Because he has tested negative, he's free to badger her about the risks involved in her treating patients while moving on to his next potential conquest, a sexy waitress named Carla (Lisa Nicole Carson).  Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards) continues to be one of the series' focal points, struggling to survive the bureaucracy of management and still feel like a doctor.  And now single, he goes on bad dates as does Dr. Lewis (Sherry Stringfield), both ignoring the obvious until a seemingly casual vacation invitation sets a number of uncomfortable wheels turning.The other focal point is nurse Carol Hathaway (Julianna Margulies), for whom things go from bad to worse. She has serious money problems, her career choice doesn't look so good anymore, and when a patient dies, she finds herself suspended.  That sets the stage for one of the series' most memorable episodes, which takes place almost completely outside the hospital.  Hathaway goes to the corner grocery store, where she meets guest star Ewan McGregor, and things take off from there.  She also wisely keeps her distance from former lover Dr. Ross (George Clooney), who may have really done it when he brings into the ER a one-night stand suffering from a seizure and has to admit he doesn't even know her name.County General survives a closure scare, but instead has to absorb some new additions, including chief of staff Donald Anspaugh (John Aylward), intern Maggie Doyle (Jorjan Fox), and the best pediatric surgeon in Chicago, Abby Keaton (Glenne Headley), who attracts the attention of Benton and Carter for professional and/or personal reasons.  But those additions are countered by two emotional goodbyes, and other gritty story lines, including a troubled teen (Kirsten Dunst) and an assault on a doctor, helped makeER's third season often tough to take, but unforgettable.Special features consist of commentary tracks on two episodes; a 15-minute spotlight on the episode \"Fear of Flying\" with new interviews with Sherry Stringfield, Noah Wylie, and Glenne Headley; bloopers and outtakes; and a featurette on the ER's nurses with interviews of Yvette Freeman, Abraham Benrubi, Ellen Crawford, and others, but not Julianna Margulies.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004STBFPS", "B004STBF2G", "B004STBFI0", "B00005JLFT", "B004STBEXQ", "B000MTEFUK", "B000WMA74A", "B0015XHR5C", "B001FSKE8E", "B001JAHQ0W", "B001JAHQ16", "B001JAHQ1G", "B001JAHQ1Q", "B001L1S1OO", "B001AQT158", "B00005JNJ1", "B003LXM1B4", "B001VPJZ0O", "B003F3NE1Q", "B000GPPNO2", "B003F3NDW6", "B001VPJZ0E", "B0018CWEZI", "B0018CWEXK", "B000P6YNSO", "B00I4581F4", "B0001CCXZW", "B00HRUQA6O", "B000FIMG5Y", "B00005JO9J", "B003R0MEXQ", "B00684J49U", "B002ZCY84U", "B00684J49K", "B00BBGZ17O", "B009RX7IX8", "B003LXM1PK", "B0047HXMNE", "B002BJGYTY", "B00DDHFKMA", "B00915G6R6", "B000BB1MIM", "B009RX7WTI", "B00D2UMHVA", "B001A4VH2U", "B003FSTN52", "B000ATQYXI", "B00005JLEX", "B00GLT2TR6", "B002WN8IR0", "B0053O89YM", "B003TNW04Y", "B000TGJ8AS", "B001E6FMMU", "B00EIXWMII", "B003R0MEW2", "B003L77FYS", "B00915G6TE", "B002BJGYU8", "B009LDD4V4", "B0000A2ZNL", "B0053O89KG", "B000BNXD6O", "B002NZK5VO", "B00CWX1HKU", "B0053O89IS", "B00127RAGM", "B000FIMG4U", "B003UD7J26", "B00E7XS4EA", "B00BUWD7E8", "B00GHH9HUE", "B006WK4Y6I", "B008LCRABQ", "B000MGBSIK", "B0001IN0T4", "B00386EZKE", "B00915G6NK", "B003L77G10", "B003FSTN5C", "B003L77G8I", "B000Y11B7Q", "B005LAIGSM", "B000SQFC40", "B00EIXWW2O", "B00DV2MVWO", "B004QOB8VG", "B008JFUS5A", "B00004R99F", "B003UD7J6W", "B00915G6Q2", "B000HC2LHQ", "B00ISZNCKE", "B00CYQXATG", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B00GPWEPZ8", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B00HVFA39A", "B000068QPY"], "bought_together": ["B004STBF2G", "B004STBFPS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004STBF2G", "B00005JLFT", "B004STBFI0", "B004STBFPS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 84044}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 22.8, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00064MW74", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HUH6rG-xL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "ER: Season 3"}

{"description": "Make no mistake,Clone Warsis honest-to-goodness authenticStar Wars. The animated \"microseries\" takes place betweenEpisode II, Attack of the ClonesandEpisode III, Revenge of the Sith. If the feature films cover the beginning and end of the war,Clone Warsdepicts the actual battles and events that made heroes into legends. Don't expect too much character development, as the episodes tend to be driven more by flat-out action than by dialogue (which can be a good thing, considering someStar Warsdialogue). We see such familiar faces as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda, and Mace Windu in combat, and we meet the elite ARC (Advanced Recon Commandos) clone troopers plus new Jedi--the amphibious Kit Fisto and two women, Luminara Unduli and Barriss Offee. We also see a little more development of Anakin--showing off the best pilot skills in the army, defying Obi-Wan, and engaging in a deadly duel with Sith apprentice Asajj Ventress. But just when it's clear that the Separatist droid armies are no match for a Jedi, the tide begins to turn with the introduction of the menacing General Grievous, who plays a crucial part inEpisode III. The cast mostly consists of veteran voice actors, but Anthony Daniels does appear as C-3PO.Clone Warswas created by Genndy Tartakovsky, whose resume includes such stylish series asSamurai Jack,Dexter's Laboratory, andThe Powerpuff Girls, and the program won a 2004 Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming One Hour or More). These 20 episodes, which played on the Cartoon Network (and were originally designated seasons 1 and 2), can be viewed as a seamless 69-minute whole or as individual chapters. DVD features include two commentary tracks, a making-of featurette, video game andEpisode IIItrailers, and an Xbox playable demo of the stealth gameRepublic Commando. If you're a fan who can't wait forEpisode III,Clone Warsis essential viewing.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BCE8Q4", "B001GQSY5K", "B001GQSY64", "B00E8G5H0K", "B00E8G5HFA", "B009OAWMLM", "B0002YCUPC", "B0002YCUQ6", "B00005JLXH", "B00006HBUJ", "B0026IBRRO", "B00003CX5P", "B005J9ZFWK", "B00E8G5HDW", "B0057UA4FY", "B00KH57UXS", "0345511298", "B004LROMT8", "B0002YCUR0", "B00FX58Y9Q", "B008FTX6OU", "1465408738", "B004JMF00K", "B000FAGGWQ", "1783291044", "1593079117", "B001PO53IO", "B00E9PMML2", "1595826122", "B000FQJAIW", "B00E8G5H6Y", "1616616806", "B00AXFK96M", "B007GMKWYE", "B0089BSMKM", "1465420800", "1616552271", "B00KUS5YGC", "B00K0MM4AM", "1616555513", "B00JMXWQ30", "B004LROMU2", "B00003CXCT", "B001E533E0", "B0001HAI0E", "B00K7IPGS6", "B003ZSJ212", "B005CSYQ2S", "B00APGRMX2", "B007TM7Z6O", "1595826998", "B0044E9JTG", "B007IKKSNY", "0345477642", "B000W4TGIQ", "1616552514", "B0012EM5CY", "1593076800", "1593076789", "B00005RCQJ", "B000J3O194", "B00KHA88PC", "1595822283", "B00027CXEM", "0345493346", "0811868893", "B000JLTR86", "B000F4RH8E", "B00008DHNZ", "B008FTXQ8G", "1452102279", "B000067DPK", "B00004TN2T", "0756682533", "1595828664", "1569719624", "B003F7WLAM", "1593078307", "B00GZ0ML4C", "B00HMOW9YM", "B005KR6NOK", "0553296124", "1593073070", "1593072430", "B000VDDDVE", "1595829539", "1595829474", "1419714007", "0345435419", "B001CT05VC", "0590519336", "1595828028", "B0072BNK02", "B00HXH0102", "0590519220", "0761178104", "6305869103", "B002ABVLZA"], "bought_together": ["B000BCE8Q4", "B001GQSY5K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001GQSY5K", "B00E8G5H0K", "B000BCE8Q4", "B0057UA4FY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 24277}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 34.5, "brand": "", "asin": "B0006Z2LMO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51A6GEB6SAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Wars: Clone Wars - Volume One"}

{"description": "Two young sisters recovering from an unnamed trauma must face a mysterious past in this excellent South Korean shocker. A worldwide hit upon its release and based on an old Korean fairy tale; two sisters (wonderfully played by Su-jeong Lim and Geun-yeong Mun) come to live with their cold and distant father and turn-on-a-dime stepmother in a house where nothing is as it seems.   A wonderfully haunting score, starkly beautiful imagery, and a labyrinthine plot that twists and turns at every dark corner all set the stage for a riveting and often terrifying guessing game of a movie. Equal parts drama, mystery, and ghost story,A Tale of Two Sistersis a richly complex and challenging cinematic treat that may very well demand repeat viewings.--Matt Wold", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002P7UCJK", "B000GB5MOW", "B00005JNJR", "B000GBEWNY", "B0009WFEDC", "B004P2VQZ2", "B0000CC885", "B000MM0LH8", "B000LPS3B2", "B000BGH2A4", "B0009S2T0M", "B003Y7F1IW", "B000Q7ZKWU", "B0009KA2UO", "B000088NQR", "B000E0OE4O", "B000FS9FIA", "B000FVQYW2", "B0028DRGDQ", "B00DW5IM14", "B001570H5K", "B000CRR3ME", "B000H5U5YO", "B0015ET3YO", "B000CSTKHE", "B000274TLW", "B0007XBM8O", "B000AAF25S", "B001MEJY8W", "B000E3LGMY", "B000GSE6H4", "B003UTPL2A", "B004O63TWW", "B000NO243E", "B000MEYKCI", "B000NA28GG", "B003NLE5JA", "B006L4MWVE", "B001MYIXAC", "B0000CABGW", "B0009XRZQK", "B0014VPFVS", "B0009KQOZQ", "B002OMIKSG", "B000PKG8TW", "B000GI3RHY", "B00125WATQ", "B000H0M4CK", "B000FZEQEQ", "B002U041OE", "B0000AVHAO", "B000S0GYRU", "B004P2VQXE", "B000ARFPMQ", "B001VG2MAI", "B004ZKKKW4", "B0009A40PC", "B006C1S1DY", "B00006AUIG", "B000FZEQVY", "B001KEGR66", "B000FZEQFK", "B000MM0LHS", "B004H2CXBQ", "B003JDQJM8", "B000BVM240", "B001I82RVS", "B00C6WHPO4", "B000X1RYEQ", "B000A1OFZA", "B0007CNY2W", "B00AEFYYH6", "0783116926", "B008G1JIQC", "B008OTTVC2", "B004KDYR20", "B000A2XA8M", "B00006FDBW", "B0009W5KHW", "B003Q6D246", "B00BOYLIAC", "B00009MEC4", "B005SQRYB4", "B006L4MWTQ", "B000WC38EQ", "B006QWC2ZC", "B002OVO18A", "B002E2QH8G", "B00BTFK014", "B0007M23D8", "B0009X765K", "B0016K76V4", "B00A3TFMDI", "B002LMSWN2", "B002C8YSCE", "B001D5C1OO", "B00BSU0FQA", "B0001IXSZ0", "B00004W3HF", "B0002ZDW7Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0009S2T0M", "B002P7UCJK", "B000GBEWNY", "B004P2VQZ2"]}, "price": 12.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 124871}, "asin": "B0007M2374", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517GSMP9KRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Tale of Two Sisters (Deluxe Edition)"}

{"description": "Frasier's fifth season is marked by two central themes. First is Roz's (Peri Gilpin) unexpected pregnancy, which naturally opens the door for countless promiscuity jokes for the radio show's beleaguered producer. The second is the continuing drama of Niles (David Hyde Pierce) and his frosty wife, Maris, which seems to finally come to a head. Not that even a good marriage has ever kept Niles from pining for Daphne (Jane Leeves), of course. Frasier's (Kelsey Grammer) show is sailing along, and for the occasion of his 1000th show, is honored by the mayor for \"Frasier Crane Day,\" which allows the cast to do some rare location shooting in Seattle.

{"description": "From Hollywood's legendary Cocoanut Grove to the pioneering conquest of the wild blue yonder, Martin Scorsese'sThe Aviatorcelebrates old-school filmmaking at its finest. We say \"old school\" only because Scorsese's love of golden-age Hollywood is evident in his approach to his subject--Howard Hughes in his prime (played by Leonardo DiCaprio in his)--and especially in his technical mastery of the medium reflecting his love for classical filmmaking of the studio era. Even when he's using state-of-the-art digital trickery for the film's exciting flight scenes (including one of the most spectacular crashes ever filmed), Scorsese's meticulous attention to art direction and costume design suggests an impassioned pursuit of craftsmanship from a bygone era; every frame seems to glow with gilded detail. And while DiCaprio bears little physical resemblance to Hughes during the film's 20-year span (late 1920s to late '40s), he efficiently captures the eccentric millionaire's golden-boy essence, and his tragic descent into obsessive-compulsive seclusion. Bolstered by Cate Blanchett's uncannily accurate portrayal of Katharine Hepburn as Hughes' most beloved lover,The Aviatoris easily Scorsese's most accessible film, inviting mainstream popularity without compromising Scorsese's artistic reputation. As compelling crowd-pleasers go, it's a class act from start to finish.--Jeff ShannonDVD FeaturesIn his commentary track, director Martin Scorsese offers his own impressions of Howard Hughes and rattles off his memories of experiencing Hughes's films.  He mentions how he made Cate Blanchett watch every Katharine Hepburn film from the '30s on the big screen, and observes that Kate Beckinsale had \"a real sense of the stature of a Hollywood goddess.\"  But in general he doesn't talk much about the craft of making the film.  That area is covered better by editor Thelma Schoonmaker, who also appears on the commentary track, and producer Michael Mann makes a few appearances (all were recorded separately).  The picture is brilliant, but the 5.1 sound is not as aggressive in the rear speakers and subwoofer as one might expect, other than some nice surround effects in theHell's Angelsflying sequence.The second disc collects almost three hours of features.  There's one unnecessary deleted scene, and an 11-minute making-of featurette that's basically the cast and director heaping praise on each other.  More interesting are the short featurettes on visual effects (including the XF-11 scene, of course), production design, costumes, hair and makeup, and score, and Loudon Wainwright discusses his and his children's musical performances.  Historical perspective is provided by spotlights on Hughes's role in aviation and his obsessive-compulsive disorder, and a 43-minute Hughes documentary from the History Channel (part of the Modern Marvels series, it focuses on his mechanical innovations and spends less than a minute on his movies).  More unusual are DiCaprio and Scorsese's appearance on an OCD panel, and a half-hour interview segment DiCaprio did with Alan Alda.--David HoriuchiThe Personalities ofThe AviatorClick the links to explore more movies by these stars.Leonardo DiCaprioasHoward Hughes\"Sometimes I truly fear that I... am losing my mind.

{"description": "My stars! The first, and perhaps most magical, season ofBewitchedstill casts an enchanting spell. For escapist fantasy, this series, no doubt inspired by the playBell, Book and Candle, broke significant television ground. The Stephens were sitcoms' first mixed marriage. Advertising executive Darrin Stephens (Dick York) was mortal, and wife Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery) was a witch. According to a retrospective segment included on this four-disc set, the Stephenses were also the first couple to sleep in one bed! And Samantha's mother, Endora (the venerable Agnes Morehead), and father, Maurice (Maurice Evans, most popularly known as Dr. Zaius in the originalPlanet of the Apes, were TV's first separated couple. Surely, Darrin did for advertising what Dick Van Dyke's Rob Petrie did for comedy writing. And nose-twitching Samantha certainly gave Mary Tyler Moore's Laura Petrie a run for the money in the sexy suburbanite sweepstakes. This high-concept series' saving grace was that Darrin insisted that Samantha not engage in any \"hocus-pocus.\" But in this first season, she would be compelled to use her extraordinary powers to right social wrongs (such as derogatory-witch stereotypes in the Halloween episode \"The Witches Are Out\"), champion the underdog (a lonely boy whose overprotective mother won't let him play baseball in \"Little Pitchers Have Big Fears\"), or to restore a troubled boy's Christmas spirit (\"A Vision of Sugar Plums\"). Or, she might just want to turn the tables on an insulting former girlfriend of Darrin's (the pilot, \"Darrin, Take This Witch, Samantha\").York and Montgomery had palpable chemistry. They also received able support by a stellar ensemble of character actors. Alice Pearce and Marion Lorne would earn Emmys for their signature roles as busybody neighbor Mrs. Kravitz and dotty Aunt Clara, respectively. George Tobias portrayed oblivious. long-suffering Abner Kravitz, with David White as Darrin's boss, Larry Tate. In today's more PC climate,Bewitchedmay offend the \"banHarry Potter\" crowd. But for baby boomers especially, this inaugural set will happily conjure up vintage television memories.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000ASDFIQ", "B000E3L7FK", "B000HIVIOM", "B000PISZ86", "B0014FAIYS", "B001LRTT30", "B00280QNKG", "B000E33VZ4", "B000HEZEYG", "B000FI8MQG", "B000RXZL0E", "B0006Z2L4W", "B0007V6IWQ", "B00LT1JKN2", "B000KLQUSK", "B00DXLO0D6", "B000TD48SI", "B0009B16TY", "B000E3L7EQ", "B00DXLO086", "B0000V4906", "B0050MB5AC", "B000291Q3Y", "B001BN4WHW", "B00A2L1CKO", "B000A0GORS", "B0009I7NH6", "B0072BNJ0I", "B0006BAWSI", "B000ASDFGI", "B000B5XOUM", "B000FSMEB0", "B008KZX7W0", "B00005JOEB", "B0006TPE1U", "B00005JLIC", "B00A2L1CJK", "B0002NY8PI", "B000291Q3O", "B000CCBCHQ", "B0007KIFK0", "B00009VRF0", "B0002I837M", "B000BITV1A", "B000EQ5PTQ", "B001E6JC30", "B000EXZFS0", "B000YKYT1M", "B00005JNS8", "B0009OUBPQ", "B000BT96OG", "B0000DFZ5O", "B0063FGERO", "B002E58FT2", "B000EQ45BU", "B00HVFA36I", "B00JU3S6IQ", "B002AMVEHY", "B001LM64VK", "B001N26GSE", "B000H6SY28", "B00AIA89OQ", "B001GMH8WE", "B008VNI9EW", "B00GOC74RU", "B000MQ4WMY", "B003PK28FM", "B000SMNK16", "B00000F61N", "B008VNI9TC", "B008L3650M", "B00DICPAMU", "B00GLT2SOA", "B000MGTQ6G", "B0002IQKAY", "B00JAD6BYW", "B002M9WW6W", "B000BYRCF6", "B0096RC57O", "B00FM4S8IU", "B000HWZ4IY", "B000A6T1J0", "B0001O3YHQ", "B001DZOCZU", "B005UL4NH0", "B00096S480", "B000LC4ZIA", "B00I458456", "B002ACKBU0", "B00008EYBH", "1589797493", "B00007KK5I", "B00HRUQB5O", "B003CNQPMY", "B0077T5SBS", "B0002JZT5U", "B000P6R9IA", "B000EBGE82", "B000ERVJKO", "B0002XVQNK"], "bought_together": ["B000ASDFIQ", "B000E3L7FK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DXLO086", "B00GOC74RU", "B0014FAIYS", "B000E3L7FK"]}, "price": 15.43, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 42875}, "asin": "B0009B16TE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KSHC6SXQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bewitched - The Complete First Season (Black and White)"}
{"description": "Revelationsis a spooky, classy thriller depicting the world as a battleground between satanists and those who adhere to miracles revealing God's divine plan for humanity. Bill Pullman stars as Harvard scientist Bill Massey, whose successful quest to bring his daughter's seemingly demon-possessed serial killer to justice turns him into a well-known debunker of others who claim to speak for the Beastmaster. Problem is, the man who killed Massey's girl appears to be the real thing, endowed with prophetic powers and a second sight that comes in handy when it's time to go after the grieving hero's other child.Enter Sister Josepha (Natascha McElhone), a miracles investigator whose work is financially supported by a famous billionaire but disowned by the Vatican. Josepha has been led to Massey through a brain-dead girl who, though medically impossible, quotes scripture and has drawn a map to his office.

{"description": "Val Lewton's name is synonymous with the subtlest, most mysterious brand of horror filmmaking in Hollywood's golden age, and thenine horror classicshe produced at RKO between 1942 and 1946 constitute the most remarkable cycle of creativity in B-movie history. He and director Jacques Tourneur scored with both a popular hit and a masterpiece in 1942:Cat People. The story involves a pretty young Serbian woman in Manhattan (Simone Simon) convinced that her ancestors had practiced animal worship during the Middle Ages--and that she herself might shape-change into a lithe, ravening panther if her passions were aroused. The film is uncannily successful in keeping the viewer guessing whether this is a phobia borne of morbid obsession and sexual repression, or a genuine, horrific possibility. There are two sequences of matchless artistry and almost unbearable suspense--a lonely, echoing walk through pools of lamplight alongside Central Park, and a late-night swim in a deserted indoor pool--that build to throat-grabbing climaxes and remain milestones in the history of screen horror.The Curse of the Cat People(1944), a sequel that is not quite a sequel, is a pretend-horror movie that's really a contemplation of the fragility of childhood.--Richard Jameson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000069HZO", "B000A0GOFA", "B000DZD9SM", "B000DZBNKS", "B00027JYMG", "B000A0GOFK", "B0000694WH", "B00DZP1C9K", "B00000ILEU", "B0009X75EC", "B007Y1NNAW", "B00KIZY3XW", "B004X63SCY", "B00180R06I", "B00K6D1SAC", "B00DBE97S8", "B00DBNLBAQ", "B0009X770E", "B00027JYLC", "B008D19ZPY", "B00005N5RQ", "B00ICWO1LC", "B000CCW2SY", "B002945DUW", "0783240961", "B00001TZ6Q", "B0007TKNHY", "B000WNHTCC", "B00006JMQG", "B000EHQTZO", "B000A0GOEQ", "B000244EZ6", "B00FMGPWD2", "B00CUKTHES", "6305869367", "B005D0RDKM", "B00009NHC0", "B006TTC5J0", "B0002KQNKE", "B00005A8TW", "B000TLTCT0", "B00005LC4O", "B00D9EJFZA", "B000KJTGFG", "B0007R4T26", "B003552QWC", "B00003CXCF", "B000063UR0", "B008BWFOXM", "B00006JMQH", "078323502X", "B00005LC4K", "B00K6D1QOA", "1559409002", "B001BSBBGC", "B009AGEY98", "B009KG7F30", "B000RXVND8", "B0006UEVVS", "B000244F2S", "B00009NHBC", "B00019JR5Y", "B0007ZEO8C", "B0007GAG42", "B002GSXKQA", "B0002KVULG", "B00000JQB7", "0783240953", "B000GRUQK6", "B00K6D1S7A", "B0026ZQJP2", "B001CC7PLW", "B004NWPY3E", "B000FOPPEC", "B000FWHW90", "B00005LC4J", "B00JF5GAIW", "B000G28GHG", "B00007ELDG", "B00D9EJFV4", "B000BITV92", "B0089LT800", "B000GRUQJW", "B00005JKGX", "B00023P4GA", "B00DZP1BVO", "B00005AUK9", "B000RXVNCY", "B000W4D94S", "B00I9BU60Q", "B00005NFZC", "B0000AZKO7", "B0000549B1", "B0009S4IKQ", "B0045HCJJE", "B00005RDRL", "B00006SFIT", "B0087ZG7PW", "B00005R1O7", "B00005NSXY"], "bought_together": ["B000069HZO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000069HZO", "B000A0GOEQ", "B007Y1NNAW", "B0000694WH"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30538}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000A0GOF0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51s%2BJSu9xQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cat People / The Curse of the Cat People (Horror Double Feature)"}

{"description": "Nobody Knows, an extraordinary film from Japanese director Kore-Eda Hirokazu, is a heartbreaking and touching story about how selfish a single mother can be to her four children, and how resilient children can be. Kicked out of several apartments for her large brood, Keiko (Japanese pop star You) sneaks them in to a new one (two inside the suitcases) and goes over the house rules: No loud noises. They must stay hidden inside the apartment all day, every day. Only Akira, the oldest, leaves to do grocery shopping while she works. He also makes dinner while Keiko goes out on dates (implying to her children that she's looking for a rich husband so that they can all live in a big house together).One day, Keiko (not a villain, but an unsympathetic, helium-voiced child herself) announces she's going away for a few weeks to work. She soon emerges every few months, only to drop off money before taking off again, at one point, for good. Akira forgoes any normal 12-year-old's upbringing (even school) to play mother, father, even Santa Claus to his siblings. There's a trapped feeling inNobody Knows. For the younger kids, it's the inability to escape to the outside world. For Akira, it's seeing the outside world and knowing he has too many responsibilities to participate in it--when he tries, the results are disastrous. As the children grow up and resources become more scarce, the film's tenacity to show every painful detail of their existence slows the pace to almost a standstill. Still, it's a lovely, haunting tale beset with unforced performances from its young actors, particularly Yagira, who won the best actor prize at Cannes. --Ellen A.

Few people, including his students, have any respect for him and he literally shakes in his boots during an air raid. He is quite friendly with his fellow teacher, Louise Martin and her brother Paul who also happen to be neighbors. If truth be told, Albert is quite in love with Louise but she is in a relationship with George Lambert and he feels she is quite beyond his reach. Paul is a member of the resistance and is killed when Lambert informs the Nazis. Outraged at what he's done, Albert arrives at Lambert's office just as the informer commits suicide. Albert is charged with murder but the local Nazi commander, Major Erich von Keller, offers him a deal: if Albert agrees to remain silent rather then continue a speech in his own defense which is arousing fellow citizens, he will ensure a not guilty verdict. Albert returns to the courtroom and in an act of bravery urges his fellow citizens to fight their oppressors.

{"description": "A gripping escape plan provides the narrative spine toThe Tunnel, an exciting Cold War story. This film fictionalizes the true story of the digging of a 430-foot tunnel running under the Berlin Wall in 1964, as tunnel rats on the west side labor to find a way out for friends and family in the Communist East. The principals are led by a famous German swimmer (the excellent Heino Ferch, sort of the German Bruce Willis), whose sister is trapped in East Berlin. Juicy characters abound, including some compromised East Berliners and unlikely heroes on the West side. Also incorporated into this story is an American TV news crew shooting the digging as it goes along. Director Roland Suso Richter shotThe Tunnelfor television and if it is somewhat artless, it still grabs the viewer in irresistible suspense--and sustains the tension for 167 minutes.

{"description": "Of all the documentaries that deal with the horrible events of September 11, 2001, National Geographic's two-part, 3-1/2-hour programInside 9/11is the only one to trace the evolution of Osama bin Laden's reign of terror from its origins in the Soviet-Afghan war of the early 1980s to 9/11 and beyond. Presented as a comprehensive timeline that culminates in the hijacking of four passenger jets (including those that destroyed the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York), the program incorporates news footage and archival photos, computer graphics, thoroughly researched documentation, and eyewitness interviews to build an epic chronology of Islamic fundamentalism, carried out by radical sects which, in bin Laden's own words, \"love death\" with a religious fervor that was largely dismissed, in the early stages of terrorist assembly, by American intelligence services. The stage is set for bin Laden's well-financed orchestration of al Qaeda activities, andInside 9/11reaches a factual fever pitch as it focuses on the major players (including 9/11 architect Khalil Shaikh Mohammed, hijacker pilots Mohamed Atta and Ziad Jarrah, and other \"sleeper cell\" terrorists) as the countdown to 9/11 continues. What emerges from this minute-by-minute account is, in the harsh light of history, a much-needed understanding of how 9/11 happened, the conditions that led to lapses in CIA and FBI cooperation, airport security, and the \"holy war\" that bin Laden had so effectively precipitated. Subsequent, post-9/11 suicide missions are also included in this expansive chronology, making it potently clear that the war on terror will continue, and in some respects has only just begun.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001F5274G", "B004WCSMDE", "B005KBJC0I", "B00827OX5Q", "B00006BS70", "B00006B1HI", "B005IG5K6A", "B005LSJ0SO", "B000FWHW7C", "B000065Q9C", "B000EYJHDS", "B00AZL30O2", "B004X7UAMO", "B000C3L270", "B00HEUXKOC", "B0014VPFPO", "B0032LV4MM", "B000069503", "B0027OJBQG", "1426208073", "B0002TT0O6", "B001NDLEJO", "B000GH3CR0", "B000M2E34K", "0316198021", "B00BCMT2EA", "B000K4X5PS", "B0007R4T3U", "B00006AUH7", "B002FOQY7M", "B0030BS1FM", "B00B4TAXXK", "0670031712", "B000J10F8C", "B00ENP2QZA", "B002PTVMWO", "B000JLTRIQ", "0847841332", "B0007N19C8", "B000KJU1EQ", "B003C27X44", "B00A2XTHYU", "B00005R87A", "B00005J760", "B007N31XIU", "B009INAJYM", "B006J6CED0", "B00807HU4O", "B00701QYIE", "B000GDH8JM", "B006US3UKS", "0809057395", "B002PTVMX8", "B005IG5K2E", "0805094210", "B007T40GPO", "B00G6SGV3A", "B0009IW89Y", "B00063MCHA", "B004FN274K", "B0091908Q2", "158816635X", "1576871304", "B003Q7B7D8", "B00652U70A", "B000ARXF7S", "B000059XTK", "B00B559ZJG", "B00AMHFPK6", "B009XTF8NI", "B00ARM3FTO", "B001UW59KS", "B005X7H9SQ", "B000GPCB5Q", "B0032LV4LS", "B00005JNEI", "B00006ADG4", "B0056950AK", "B004FN25UG", "B004IF4EXW", "B0071LEIPE", "B008XJM7T2", "B005GP7F34", "B008I1G6Y2", "B000BBOUW2", "B003XMKU2A", "B005O25AEU", "B0007GP836", "B006ML50SS", "B0009KNR42", "B004FN26ZK", "B006ENHG8Q", "1571108122", "B004FN274A", "B009OE2O70", "B009AMANBA", "B000K4X5PI", "B00AZNEW5G", "B001CU7XR0"], "bought_together": ["B001F5274G", "B004WCSMDE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005KBJC0I", "B004WCSMDE", "B001F5274G", "B00827OX5Q"]}, "price": 29.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 306663}, "asin": "B000BBS9QK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51tX%2BiS3njL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "National Geographic - Inside 9/11"}
{"description": "Following in the tradition of such great World War II films as \"Saving Private Ryan\" and \"Patton\", \"The Great Raid\" tells the true story of an American rescue mission that took place over five days in January, 1945. Cabanatuan prison was located some thirty miles behind Japanese lines. Inside its walls were over 500 American prisoners. Many were survivors of the Bataan death march. These men had been improsoned for over three years. Many began to feel that their country had left them behind.\n\nBy late 1944, the Americans had returned to the Philippines. After learning about the existance of Cabanatuan, the Americans devised a plan to send an elite group of Army Rangers in to resue the POWs. Lt. Col. Henry Mucci (Benjamin Bratt), commander of the 6th Ranger Batallion, was given the assignment of developing the mission. Captain Robert Prince (James Franco) was placed in charge of planning and actually carrying out the raid. The Rangers would have to travel thirty miles into enemy-held territory, much of the time in broad daylight with very little cover. Fortunately, they received a great deal of help from the Filipino resistance.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFXRRO", "B00AEFXVCU", "B00AEBBA36", "B0015D20FE", "B000M4RG42", "B00005PJ8T", "B000065U1N", "B000095WW8", "B001IBIHQ4", "B00006CXSS", "B00AEBB86U", "B00005JPKE", "B00001ZWUS", "B00005N5S3", "B00005JK8K", "0471037427", "038549565X", "0792839730", "B001KZOUU0", "B00C2535TE", "B0007TKNGA", "B00HEPE6MM", "079284646X", "B007HCI42A", "B000EHSVSC", "B000MGTQ7U", "B003ASLJOU", "B004C45AZU", "B000WMA6R8", "B00772M1D8", "B000E0WJN2", "B000ELL1R6", "B00BTYNXL4", "B005LAIGYQ", "B000MRA542", "B00005AVZU", "B003ELKNH2", "B000E5N6KW", "B00003CXHJ", "0792844017", "B00005PJ8K", "B000O599YO", "B00AEFYBA6", "B00003CXTG", "B0007KIFGE", "B00004XPPG", "B003AWRMCO", "B005DKS1TE", "B007WXUVHU", "B000R9U3B0", "B005OTGS4E", "B000066C6J", "B000EHSVS2", "B00005PJ8S", "B00005U8F4", "B00BY0EBK0", "B00005R87B", "B00096S4B2", "B00AEFYENK", "B00005JKTP", "B008JFUNKU", "B000P0J09C", "B00004XPPC", "B002EAYE0Q", "B00275EGWY", "B00008AOTR", "B002OGMGV4", "B001PO55LE", "B002O3Z510", "B00AEBB86A", "B00D3XMA9A", "B00DL48BM6", "0792838408", "B00AEFXKUI", "B005LAIGRS", "B000EHSVVE", "B00005N5S2", "B00K2CHY1Y", "B000NVT0RU", "B00008R9M6", "B00008J2PG", "B00003CXA6", "B001CU9D2I", "B002ZG97RE", "B005HQBO9I", "B00005OSJQ", "B00008AOTO", "B00JA3RVG4", "B000O599VC", "B004SJVQ4I", "B004P7CMVE", "B0001NBMH6", "B00080ETYA", "B00005R23T", "0385495641", "B00004ZBVG", "B00021R7BM", "B00CLH09UQ", "B004GSVXBW", "B00911L7VA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFXVCU", "B00AEFXRRO", "B00AEBBA36", "B00001ZWUS"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 239439}, "asin": "B000BOH8UA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WY802K3GL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Great Raid (Widescreen Director's Cut)"}
{"description": "Nobody does comic existential angst like Nicolas Cage, who gets a good workout inThe Weather Man, an underrated slice of quiet desperation. Cage plays David Spritz, a Chicago TV meteorologist who knows only too well the constant uncertainty of predicting the weather. Despite a possible offer from a network morning show, David's life is a mess:  he's estranged from his kids and irritated wife (Hope Davis), he's perpetually at odds with his remote father (Michael Caine), and lately people on the street have had the disconcerting habit of throwing food at him. Director Gore Verbinski (Pirates of the Caribbean) has perhaps too heavy a touch for this kind of comic melancholy, but screenwriter Steven Conrad has an interesting, almost Mamet-like ear for \"written\" dialogue--Cage has a few voiceover monologues, including an uproarious sequence involving tartar sauce and a walk to the store, that are hugely funny. It's possible that we've seen Cage in this kind of character one too many times, but he's still good at it, and his doleful face and pasted-on smile fit the mood of the picture. Unlike the heroes of most Hollywood movies, David Spritz doesn't always--or often--do the right thing, but Cage makes you want to see the poor sap make it.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00012QLB4", "B005F2JRUC", "B00005JLRE", "B000JYW5DW", "B000BBOUW2", "B001J710Z2", "B000PMFRZQ", "B000GRUMRS", "B000CNESJO", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B00E8G5HNM", "B000BYA5G4", "B000059TG6", "B004EPYZOO", "B00003CXXG", "B000IFRT5Q", "B001GCUO02", "B00BTYMPX6", "0767810856", "6304806434", "B00006LPGP", "B002TVQ48A", "B002TVQ48K", "B001MLZNLW", "B00441GZ00", "B00000G02H", "B00008L3UF", "0792838068", "B00AEBB8JM", "B00BJB2GZG", "B004XFZ4JK", "B00062IDGK", "B000OVLBF8", "B007IUEEA2", "B000B8I9Y0", "B002GHHHKG", "B00IKM5OYW", "0792844831", "B000NA1WDQ", "076780676X", "B001JIE7JC", "B00005JLSB", "B0007P0X9G", "B00007AJF8", "B00C6F61HS", "6304711891", "B00005JL7Q", "B00005JK8K", "B00005JN5E", "B00004Z4WR", "B004SIP95G", "B00003CXPV", "B00003L9CH", "B00000JGHL", "B00275EHBY", "B00003CWTI", "B0071HPOV0", "B0015OKWKS", "B002VECMAE", "B00HUCF6KK", "B0039UT3LK", "6301971345", "B000EHRVOW", "B00AEFYAC0", "B000H0MKOC", "B005DCJ2DG", "B00007J5VQ", "B002ZG99KO", "B003102JDM", "B0009R1TI6", "B002CPMB9O", "B00BB67UNW", "B000FDEVA2", "B000CBCWRG", "B000066TGP", "B0013D8LC2", "B00020HAX8", "B00005JLO8", "B00005JLFA", "B001P3SA8K", "B002ZG980U", "B0045HCJFS", "B006TTC5MM", "B000DZIGDU", "B000H6SXSI", "B00AEBB9CS", "B000EDWKXI", "B000NIVJF4", "B00062IVM6", "B00009K011", "B0015OKWKI", "B009L79YFU", "B00005JMJG", "B0002W4UDE", "B000286RNE", "B002ZG983M", "B000UJ48SQ", "B000MEYFY6", "B00008EY9G", "B00AEBB9WI"], "bought_together": ["B00012QLB4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00012QLB4", "B000JLTRIQ", "B005F2JRUC", "B000JYW5DW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 132923}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.47, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B000CSUNQQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JTWC5Y4HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Weather Man (Widescreen Edition)"}

She impulsively travels to Jindabyne, a snowy ski resort town, because she once met a man from there who said she should call him if she was ever in town. When that connection doesn't materialize, Heidi is forced to fend for herself with little money. Her first night in town, she goes to a bar, drinks, meets a boy, and goes home with him. She doesn't even notice Joe (Sam Worthington) watching her. The next morning, Heidi is dismayed to find that the guy she slept with has a girlfriend, and is on his way back to Sydney. Desperate and broke, she goes looking for work. Despite her good looks and charm, she's a bit too aggressive in trying to win friends and influence people. That night, she hooks up with Joe, and senses a connection between them. Instead of taking her home, he takes her to a motel. He seems reluctant to get involved with her, but she is persistent. The next morning, he hurriedly leaves for work. Joe works for his father, a wealthy farmer. Heidi meets the motel owner, Irene (Lynette Curran), who kindly offers to let her stay a couple of days, until she finds a job.

{"description": "If you're a sucker for the big top--and specifically if you're a sucker for the cornball melodrama ofThe Greatest Show on Earth--you might be the audience forRing of Fear, an obvious knock-off of Cecil B. DeMille's Oscar-winner. Otherwise, it would take not just sawdust in the blood but sawdust in the head to enjoy this silly suspense movie. It's set in the Clyde Beatty Circus, and the illustrious Mr. Beatty (a famed lion-tamer in his day) gets top billing--although his is by no means the central performance. A lunatic (Sean McClory, apparently wearing Charlton Heston's jacket and hat fromGreatest Show) escapes from prison in order to stalk a former flame, circus trapeze artist Marian Carr. In a bizarre plot twist, the famous writer of hard-boiled novels, Mickey Spillane, arrives at the circus to research a story and ends up investigating the strange acts of sabotage that are dogging the big top. (A truly wonderful flashback informs us that not only has McClory returned to the circus to win back the aerialist, he also wants revenge on Beatty, who once laughed at him for showing cowardice in the presence of a jungle cat.) Mickey Spillane plays himself, and although he can't act much he gives a nice presentation of a 1950s hep cat. Supposedly Spillane worked on some of the dialogue; one hopes he wrote his own gotcha to the villain, \"Your eyes... they belong to a homicidal maniac.\" Lots of footage is devoted to Beatty snapping his whip at lions and tigers in his act, but other than that there's surprisingly little circus action. The John Wayne-Robert Fellows company (later known as Batjac) produced this one, which is in good, early CinemaScope.You never see the title character in William Wellman'sTrack of the Cat--a black panther terrorizing the land and herd of a frontier family--which is just one of the many bold strokes of this ambitious movie. The intruder claims not merely cattle but also one family member, so middle son (and unquestioned alpha male) Robert Mitchum goes out in the dead of winter to bag the cat. Meanwhile, the tensions inside the ranch house are distilled from Greek tragedy with a large dollop of Freud:  harridan mother Beulah Bondi (good performance) wants her sons to remain unmarried, despite the fact that youngest boy Tab Hunter has fallen for a forward lass played by Diana Lynn. Teresa Wright--almost unrecognizable as the spinster sister--speaks for sanity and modern thinking.Trackis the second film Wellman made from a novel by Walter Van Tilburg Clark; the first wasThe Ox-Bow Incident, that equally serious and offbeat Western about lynch violence. For this   one, Wellman admitted that one of his motivations was a long-held desire to make a color film that was essentially black-and-white; the snowy backdrops of the exteriors (shot spectacularly around Washington State's Mount Rainier) offered that chance. It's a very exactingly directed movie, both indoors and out, and qualifies as an experiment in mise-en-scene; but experiments in mise-en-scene have rarely translated into box-office success, andTrack of the Catwas no exception. One problem:  despite Mitchum's robust presence, his solitary journey (which could be covered in interior monologue in a novel) is rather inscrutable. The spiky script is by A.I. Bezzerides, who would doKiss Me, Deadlya year later. By the way, Wellman later regretted not showing the cat--but he was right the first time. It's an eerie touch in a movie that gets under your skin.Plunder of the Sunplays like a low-budget merging of two Bogart classics,The Treasure of the Sierra MadreandThe Maltese Falcon. Wiseguy Al Colby (Glenn Ford) finds himself short of funds in Havana, but a mysterious antiquities trader (Francis L. Sullivan, doing his best Sydney Greenstreet) enlists Colby to transport a package from Cuba to Mexico. The package is a piece in a puzzle that could lead to millions in ancient gold, possibly buried in the elaborate ruins of Zapotecan temples--if Colby can survive the other adventurers jockeying to get the stuff. Director John Farrow keeps the story moving and the shadows at a satisfyingly noirish level even if the material never rises to anything like classic status, while Glenn Ford provides a fitting cruel streak for his nobody-makes-a-sucker-out-of-me hero. This was one of two movies Farrow made in Mexico that year for John Wayne's Batjac production company, the other beingHondo. The balled-up plot, international gaggle of eccentric performers (most colorfully Wayne regular Sean McClory), and somewhat chintzy location shooting call to mind another globe-trotting movie of that era, Orson Welles'Mr. Arkadin, and this movie even shares actress Particia Medina with that picture.A film noir set-up unfolds in the opening minutes ofMan in the Vault: while relaxing one night at a bowling alley, a humble locksmith named Tommy Dancer (William Campbell) finds himself dragged into a bank heist plot because of his dexterity with lock-picking. It only takes 72 minutes for Tommy's nightmare to unfold, and yet the storyline seems uncommonly convoluted; rival gangsters are involved, Tommy strikes a volatile match with a slumming Beverly Hills dame (Karen Sharpe), and a moll plays a seemingly extraneous role--not that there's anything wrong with that, when the moll is the young Anita Ekberg. The ultra-cheap production values deflate the effort to put some noir atmosphere into the thing, but the main problem is leading man Campbell, who was a cross between Vince Edwards and a young Tony Curtis, but without the attitude. (He had been inThe High and the Mighty--like this film produced by John Wayne's Batjac company--and went on to many TV roles.) Still, there are moments, and director Andrew V. McLaglen tries to work some ingenious visual touches into the mix. Berry Kroeger makes a truly decadent villain, while Batjac regular Pedro Gonzalez Gonzalez gives comic relief. The film comes very early in the credits of McLaglen and screenwriter Burt Kennedy, both of whom became associated with Westerns later in their long, fruitful careers. The movie keeps returning to the bowling alley (\"Art Linkletter's La Cienaga\") thereby setting up one of the strangest scenes of noir menace ever filmed.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00BY0EBK0", "B00C81AW8E", "B0009ML2JC", "B00007ELD2", "B007Y1NR1W", "B0009OL8IK", "B000B83846", "B00BCMSYDU", "B009ANP24C", "B000087F3G", "1478390611", "B00D3XMNAG", "B00DS79H7E", "B0001US6CS", "B00284G2AI", "B000A3456M", "B00DS79HG0"], "bought_together": ["B0009ML2JC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BDH6E4", "B00B1CGFVE", "B000EQHXMI", "B000U1ZV6M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 323544}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 17.62, "brand": "Paramount Pictures", "asin": "B000ERVJJA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GPSWVZ7CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "John Wayne's Suspense Collection (Ring of Fear / Track of the Cat / Plunder of the Sun / Man in the Vault)"}

{"description": "\"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\" was clearly comedian Bob Newhart and company's motto during the fourth season (1975-76) ofThe Bob Newhart Show, all  24 episodes of which are preserved in this three-disc set. Even with the show's ratings dipping somewhat, there's no shark-jumping going on here; Newhart and producers Jay Tarses and Tom Patchett clearly understood what made this show tick, and notwithstanding a little tinkering, they stuck with it. \"It,\" of course, largely depended on Newhart himself. A brilliant reactor, he continues to bring his array of deadpan takes and brilliant, understated timing to the part of Chicago psychologist Bob Hartley, who's surrounded by the usual group of family (primarily Suzanne Pleshette as wife Emily), friends (Peter Bonerz as best bud Jerry Robinson), neighbors (Bill Daily as the tactless Howard Borden), staff (Marcia Wallace is always a riot as receptionist Carol Kester), patients (Jack Riley is the standout as the neurotic Mr. Carlin, but they're all good), and various guest stars (including Rene Auberjonois, Tom Poston, and Lawrence Pressman). Carol gets married a few episodes in, and Emily is promoted to vice-principal at her school, but these are largely cosmetic changes that do little to alter the series' overall tone.Aside from Newhart himself, props are due to the writers. As always,The Bob Newhart Show's humor is mostly low-key, with none of the raunch, tasteless sexual innuendo, and flamboyant idiocy of today's sit-coms. What's more, subjects as serious as death (\"The Longest Good-bye\" and \"Death of a Fruitman\"), obesity (\"Heavyweights,\" in which Bob presides over a workshop for \"people of the hefty persuasion\"), professional ethics (\"Who is Mr. X?\"), and jealousy on the job (\"A Matter of Vice-Principal\") are broached without ever becoming sententious or heavy-handed. Of course, three decades after the fact, some things will seem a little dated: the clothes are cringe-worthy, and it's hard to imagine anyone these days getting away with describing Beirut as a place where \"everybody looks like Danny Thomas.\" Still, Newhart's show remains one of the best of the several great sit-coms that emerged in the '70s. Bonus features include commentary (by Newhart and others) on five episodes, a gag reel, and a featurette.--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000E6ES9Y", "B000A9QKSM", "B000YKYT1M", "B000BOH8YQ", "B0011N19HI", "B003VTKZ84", "B000EXDS02", "B002WN8IR0", "B00GHH9HW2", "B00096S480", "B00HNGC56G", "B00005JLIC", "B00JHH1VUU", "B006VC3LDO", "B000G6BLDI", "B00HRUQB5O", "B00H8KC1N4", "B00KTZALDC", "B000EQ5PTQ", "B001OXLGK0", "B00FM4S7P4", "B001DHXT52", "B001O4KBN2", "B00274SIVK", "B003CNQPME", "B00GOC74QG", "B000Z27H8Q", "B000N2HD6O", "B000LXGXY8", "B002PQ7JR4", "B000NTMA1U", "B000F8O2MO", "B000291Q3O", "B000A0GOP0", "B000M343B2", "B000XJD3K2", "B0014FAIXO", "B00G5N6C8U", "B000Y7U9AK", "B000MGTQ6G", "B000BGR1B4", "B000EBGE82", "B0019BI114", "B00IF0KAYS", "B000BYRCF6", "B00BHWG0N6", "B004083REE", "B0014FAIYS", "B00FM4S8IU", "B0030BS1E8", "B000B6CODY", "B005DCJ0Q0", "B004WO9OMA", "B001GMH8WE", "B000HWZ4IY", "B006363QHE", "B0007TKG76", "B000WQWPSW", "B000G0O5J6", "B000UX6TLG", "B0009UC80Q", "B000FSME10", "B002C8YSBU", "B0001IN0BC", "B000QUEQ6I", "B0011FLGYM", "B000M343AS", "B001P9N9B2", "B0041SI7B6", "B001JTRKHW", "B009TTGLJ2", "B000PGTPC8", "B0007WFY4S", "B001JFKWE4", "B000BF0C8E", "B000CCBCCG", "B000E3L7EQ", "B00GLT2SOA", "B0001NBNIY", "B000E3L7FK", "B0031XYLR6", "B004MWLXTY", "B002E58FTM", "B001O4KBP0", "B002FLOTFO", "B0006IUDYY", "B00GLPYVT4", "B000MQ4WMY", "B00IZ27GD4", "B000H6SY28", "B0025KVNOU", "B0009IWGOG", "B00JDCP0QA", "B000TD2KY2", "B000CELOVI", "B0009UC7MK", "B00HW3LG3S", "B0006N2EZA"], "bought_together": ["B000E6ES9Y", "B000A9QKSM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000YKYT1M", "B000A9QKSM", "B00HRUQB5O", "B000E6ES9Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 36101}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B000G6BL7O", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515Y74F2MQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Bob Newhart Show: Season 4"}

{"description": "More of a real-life exploitation film than a bonafide documentary,Cocaine Cowboysis tailor-made for anyone who worships Brian De Palma'sScarface. It's no surprise that this slick, energetic film found a niche audience among crime-obsessed hip-hoppers; from a journalistic perspective it's an irresponsible mess, but director Billy Corben is obviously more interested in capturing the thrills and danger of the drug trade that transformed Miami, Florida during theMiami Viceera of the late 1970s and '80s. Corben has no particular interest in seriously examining the sociopolitical implications of Miami's drug-fueled rise and fall, soCocaine Cowboyslives up to its title by focusing on some of the most colorful, daring, and outrageously successful survivors of that era, when tons of cocaine were distributed through Miami by the kingpins of Colombia's notorious Medellin cartel. Chief among the many interviewees are Jon Roberts and Mickey Munday (who personally transported over $2 billion worth of cocaine into Miami) and Jorge \"Rivi\" Ayala, a convicted drug-trade assassin now serving consecutive life terms in prison. They're lively storytellers who are egotistically eager to share their coke-tales, and Corben's only too happy to capture their exploits on film, up to and including the dubious use of violent reenactments that could easily serve as a recruitment film for Tony Montana wannabes.It's simultaneously disgusting and compelling, especially since Corben has a knack for matching swift editing to the pulsing score by TV's originalMiami Vicecomposer Jan Hammer. In the final analysis, it must be said thatCocaine Cowboyssucceeds as a brash and breathtaking record of a bygone era, when murder rates were at an all-time high, coke was everywhere, and Miami was financially transformed into a nightlife mecca where criminals were kings. Or queens, as in the case of Griselda Blanco, the ruthless and self-appointed \"Godmother\" of the cocaine trade, who was responsible for countless murders and as of 2007 remained at large, her whereabouts unknown. All of this deadly life in the fast lane makes for a fascinating movie, but Corben and coproducer David Cypkin's breathless commentary makes it clear that they're young, immature thrill-seekers, and their film makes no apologies for glorifying the drug trade while exploring its bloody and frequently fatal consequences. Their commentary also accompanies an abundance of deleted scenes, and there's also a bonus featurette, \"Hustlin' with the Godmother,\" in which Griselda Blanco's former lover and big-time coke dealer Charles Cosby tells his story, which clearly has all the makings of a Hollywood movie along the lines ofBlow. You can bet that film will eventually be made, and don't be surprised if it's Corben who makes it.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00180R03Q", "B004L9GLPE", "B000YDOOQE", "B003BEE292", "0307450430", "B002HREZBE", "B0014FAIV6", "B0015XASZ8", "B000TGJ8EY", "B000S0PLU6", "B00003CXWV", "B00473YVZQ", "B000RETO10", "0307450422", "B00CMDPT3Q", "B000LC4620", "B003X8CWBQ", "0671703129", "B00JF5GAIW", "B007F5M91Q", "B00J5G1P2W", "B0006VXM9E", "B004SIP93S", "1558908390", "B009L9LC4E", "B00CPKZKX0", "B002CPMB9O", "B000C20VRS", "B000MG2LTK", "B00I45844W", "B007HOQ5FQ", "B0001FGBUW", "B0009K7RMA", "B0025XUTKQ", "0312674155", "B00CEJVNEM", "B00004Z1FX", "B008RDVL3M", "B00004U103", "B000C20VPA", "B00005QCVX", "B00DRCY9UA", "B00000JGHV", "B000JRYOPG", "B00IARA8KM", "B00546LRBG", "B000JBXHZA", "B006MNIYFW", "B000060MWA", "B00CNEVHQC", "B002C749YM", "B00FPT70VS", "B00GHH9HJA", "B001LEPEDW", "B007TBIUSM", "B00IPL28QU", "B00GMV8AEO", "B00J0IPLBQ", "B0006HBLUK", "B0043X1FI6", "B00H9KKKAY", "B003VA3JZY", "B00005U156", "B0051MKNV8", "1484091183", "0615305733", "B0041QSZS8", "B00HOGBXS6", "0802137571", "B00GBT62PQ", "B0000YEE6M", "9584233408", "B001CO42MU", "B000H5TH20", "B000GGSMC6", "B000P0J09M", "0393336646", "B005X7HA9E", "0792839056", "B00D5XC8PE", "B001LN6NRE", "B00004XPPB", "B00GU8HIMY", "B0000TWMT8", "B004SEUJXM", "B00AEFYE08", "0517568217", "B00GUO2SKA", "B000E3E266", "B001B7CNW4", "B000N3SROA", "B0000JBUHI", "0792833287", "B0019X3YZA", "B000P0J0D8", "B004499NII", "0783230443", "B002954A4Q", "B00IXD2LJY"], "bought_together": ["B00180R03Q", "B004L9GLPE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0307450430", "B00180R03Q", "B000TGJ8EY", "0061000272"]}, "price": 9.9, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17425}, "asin": "B000KLQUUS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/610XV6GXD5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cocaine Cowboys"}

{"description": "This film is more a creative,  classy thriller,  rather than a  straight-up horror film.  In addition in  Little Erin Merryweather  the men are the victims for once, and a young woman the serial killer. The film flips the genre on its head while being a throwback to the 70's style of Horror film made popular by The Omen . Overall the film is very powerful, and makes use of the beautiful landscape of his home state as an integral part of the film it becomes almost a character. --Samantha Fields, Wellesley TownsmanI gotta tell ya that I really did like Little Erin Merryweather. Vigdis Anholt turned in a really cool performance as the mentally deranged Erin Merryweather. I guarantee you ll get a kick out of Erin when she s all  dolled  up. I was really diggin  the whole  dolly/painting/child voice over  that occasionally sprung up during Erin s frequent breaks from reality as well. It really added a creepy atmosphere to the film. I should also mention writer/director David Morwick s performance as Peter Bloom; he did a pretty damn good job. These two actors really stood out from the rest. --Brian Harris, Joehorror.comLEM is an intelligent fast-paced thriller that strays away from previous slasher films in a good way. Instead of being one big 90 minute homage to films of the past, Morwick took us into a new realm, one of which we have never been before. Unlike \"Urban Legend\" or \" I Spit on Your Grave,\" were the female is just out for revenge, LEM gives us a REAL reason for a female killer. Little Erin Merryweather blew my socks off!

{"description": "Martin Scorsese makes a welcome return to the mean streets (of Boston, in this case) withThe Departed, hailed by many as Scorsese's best film sinceCasino. Since this crackling crime thriller is essentially a Scorsese-stamped remake of the acclaimed 2002 Hong Kong thrillerInfernal Affairs, the film was intensely scrutinized by devoted critics and cinephiles, and while Scorsese's intense filmmaking and all-star cast deserve ample acclaim,The Departedis also worthy of serious re-assessment, especially with regard to what some attentive viewers described as sloppy craftsmanship (!), notably in terms of mismatched shots and jagged continuity. But no matter where you fall on the Scorsese appreciation scale, there's no denying thatThe Departedis a signature piece of work from one of America's finest directors, designed for maximum impact with a breathtaking series of twists, turns, and violent surprises. It's an intricate cat-and-mouse game, but this time the cat and mouse are both moles: Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is an ambitious cop on the rise, planted in the Boston police force by criminal kingpin Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a hot-tempered police cadet who's been artificially disgraced and then planted into Costello's crime operation as a seemingly trustworthy soldier. As the multilayered plot unfolds (courtesy of a scorching adaptation byKingdom of Heavenscreenwriter William Monahan), Costigan and Sullivan conduct a volatile search for each other (they're essentially looking for \"themselves\") while simultaneously wooing the psychiatrist (Vera Farmiga) assigned to treat their crime-driven anxieties.Such convenient coincidences might sink a lesser film, butThe Departedis so electrifying that you barely notice the plot-holes. And while Nicholson's profane swagger is too much \"Jack\" and not enough \"Costello,\" he's still a joy to watch, especially in a film that's additionally energized by memorable (and frequently hilarious) supporting roles for Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg, and a host of other big-name performers.The Departedalso makes clever and plot-dependent use of cell-phones, to the extent that it couldn't exist without them. Powered by Scorsese's trademark use of well-chosen soundtrack songs (from vintage rock to Puccini's operas),The Departedmay not be perfect, but it's one helluva ride for moviegoers, proving popular enough to become the biggest box-office hit of Scorsese's commercially rocky career.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002ZG99N6", "B000P0J09M", "B004SIP7TE", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002ZG980U", "B002VWNIEA", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEBB8NI", "B002T9H2LA", "B00005JLSB", "B000MZHW40", "B00080ZG10", "B003ASLJQS", "B000P0J0AG", "B000P0J0EW", "B000C20VPA", "B003UESJHO", "B004SIP7ZS", "B003ASLJO0", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AHTYI5M", "B00275EGWY", "B000XR9L50", "B000A3XY5A", "B0007DFJ0G", "B001N44BVQ", "B00003CXWV", "B008MILL8W", "B000286RP2", "B004SIP7VM", "B00005V9HH", "6305313687", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004FQX5B6", "B00AEFXKUI", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEBB86A", "B005LAIIJY", "B0016Q2D66", "B003ASLJQI", "B00008975Z", "B000IY04Q8", "B001P9KR8U", "B00005JNJV", "B000C20VRS", "B008R65XYC", "B005LAIGRS", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00008DP4C", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00005JN0W", "B005LAIGLE", "B000A2UBN4", "B002QEHPQU", "B000P0J0EM", "B003UESJH4", "B007D5E7C2", "6304765258", "B000P0J0D8", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00004WG2F", "0767830555", "B000LC55F2", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B004EPYZP8", "B000A7DVR2", "B00005JPD0", "B000WZEZGI", "B00049QQHI", "B000FS9FCG", "B00004XPPB", "B006OFN0SE", "B009AMAL4Y", "B004U7MR14", "B000GFLKF8", "B003AWRMCE", "B0019L770A", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B0000AM6JI", "B004SIP9Z6", "B001GZ6QC4", "0783240295", "B0010DR4BO", "B000065U1N", "B00001ZWUS", "B00BB67UNW", "B0000B1OFL", "B00AEBB9K0", "B00DHDDE32", "B00005JKWX", "B0051MKNV8", "B002ZG97RE", "0767802519", "B0034G4P94", "B00DHHWXYY", "B00005B6JZ", "B00003CXZ4", "B001TODCII"], "bought_together": ["B000P0J09M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000RETOHY", "B000P0J09M", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEBB8NI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5067}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.5, "brand": "Warner Bros", "asin": "B000M341QE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RZnzpL34L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "It takes a certain kind of comic genius to create a character who is, to quote the classic Sondheim lyric, appealing and appalling. But be forewarned:Boratis not \"something for everyone.\" It arrives as advertised as one of the most outrageous, most offensive, and funniest films in years. Kazakhstan journalist Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen reprising the popular character from hisDa Ali G Show), leaves his humble village to come to \"U.S. and A\" to film a documentary. After catching an episode ofBaywatchin his New York hotel room, he impulsively scuttles his plans and, accompanied by his fat,hirsute producer (Hardy to his Laurel), proceeds to California to pursue the object of his obsession, Pamela Anderson.Boratis not about how he finds America; it's about how America finds him in a series of increasingly cringe-worthy scenes. Borat, with his '70s mustache, well-worn grey suit, and outrageously backwards attitudes (especially where Jews are concerned) interacts with a cross-section of the populace, catching them, a la Alan Funt onCandid Camera, in the act of being themselves. Early on, an unwitting humor coach advises Borat about various types of jokes. Borat asks if his brother's retardation is a ripe subject for comedy. The coach patiently replies, \"That would not be funny in America.\" NOT! Borat is subversively, bracingly funny. When it comes to exploring uncharted territory of what is and is not appropriate or politically correct, Borat knows no boundaries, as when he brings a fancy dinner with the southern gentry to a halt after returning from the bathroom with a bag of his feces (\"The cultural differences are vast,\" his hostess graciously/patronizingly offers), or turns cheers to boos at a rodeo when he calls for bloodlust against the Iraqis and mangles \"The Star Spangled Banner.\"Success, John F. Kennedy once said, has a thousand fathers. A paternity test onBoratmight reveal traces of Bill Dana's Jose Jimenez, Andy Kaufman, Michael Moore,The Jamie Kennedy Xperiment, andJackass. Some scenes seem to have been staged (a game Anderson, whom Borat confronts at a book signing, was reportedly in on the setup), but others, as the growing litany of lawsuits attests, were not. All too real is Borat's encounter with loutish Southern frat boys who reveal their sexism and racism, and the disturbing moment when he asks a gun store owner what gun he would recommend to \"kill a Jew\" (a Glock automatic is the matter-of-fact reply). Comedy is not pretty, and inBoratit can get downright ugly, as when Borat and his producer get jiggly with it during a nude fight that spills out from their hotel room into the hallway, elevator, lobby and finally, a mortgage brokers association banquet. High-five! --Donald LiebensonOn the DVD\"Global Visitings\" capturesBorat-mania in all its hype and glory, as Sacha Baron Cohen, never breaking character, promotes his film around the world. On the itinerary isLate Night with Conan O'Brienand the Toronto Film Festival, a now-legendary screening aborted after a projector malfunction. A mixed bag of deleted scenes finds Borat trying to bait more unsuspecting citizens, including an animal-control worker who refuses Borat a dog after he asks, \"How do you recommend I cook this?\" and a doctor who is nonplussed by Borat's obscene medical history. A supermarket visit offers the most maddening fromage-inspired looniness since Monty Python's \"Cheese Shop\" sketch. Also good for a few chuckles are a faux soundtrack commercial and aBaywatchparody (\"Sexydangerwatch\").--Donald LiebensonBeyondBoratAll things Sacha Baron CohenBoratApparelBoratSoundtrackStills fromBorat(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002P7UCJ0", "B005LAIHGI", "B0002ZMITY", "B002OID4WM", "B00020X852", "B000A88ESW", "B000WZEZGI", "B001G5T6GW", "B005LAIHHC", "B00AEFZ8OY", "B002P7UCJA", "B00005JNZU", "B001DPHDB0", "B001J9KJ4I", "B00G2P79BU", "B000J4QW8Q", "B00AEFYS2M", "B00005JMYI", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B0006GANPA", "B001OD4S50", "6305922756", "B003XJABTK", "B00AEBBA2C", "B008R65XNS", "B000BKVQS4", "B00AEBB9K0", "B003CRM6PA", "B000A7DVR2", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B0016MOV92", "B000BKJ762", "B00009W5CA", "B000AP04L0", "B008220BGQ", "B002T9H2LA", "B00068WOH8", "0385523467", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00008975Z", "B004SIP95G", "B00003CXZ1", "0783229526", "B002ZG99N6", "B003VPX5Y4", "B002SJIO4A", "B00005JLQN", "B00AEFY854", "B00005O3VC", "B004XVMCH6", "B000K7VHQE", "B0006HBZEW", "B00005JMUA", "B000VE439Y", "B00AEFXDO6", "B000EMGJAO", "B0000A02TZ", "B00005JNBQ", "B003Y5H5B0", "B00BEIYMZ6", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000MCH5RM", "B000K7VHOG", "B00005ALS0", "B001UV4X8S", "B00009MGEM", "B0001Z4OXS", "B000C20VPA", "B0012IWNZY", "B00CE00ZV8", "B00005QCVX", "B000I0RNVQ", "B000022TSW", "B001TOD92C", "B000P0J09M", "B00005JL78", "B00AEFYAMA", "B00AEFXGIY", "B000J4P9P8", "B000055Y0X", "B004EPZ084", "B001VLBDD0", "B00AEFY5B6", "B006XZWAWM", "B00005JKMN", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000XFVIOO", "B002GSXKOW", "B00006G8HR", "B000HT386M", "B000MQCUJG", "B00007AJF7", "B00005KA6V", "B004SIP9MY", "B00AEBBA72", "B00018D42W", "B000TZJBPQ", "B0009HBPN0", "B004P9UWM8"], "bought_together": ["B005LAIHGI", "B002P7UCJ0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005LAIHGI", "B000WZEZGI", "B002OID4WM", "B000TZJBPQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15271}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.29, "brand": "COHEN,SACHA BARON", "asin": "B000MMMT9G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51uGbGa68JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"}
