{"description": "In the first and finestRoboCopmovie, director Paul Verhoeven combined near-future science fiction with a keen sense of social satire--not to mention enough high-velocity violence to satisfy even the most voracious bloodlust. InStarship Troopers, Verhoeven andRoboCopcowriter Ed Neumeier take inspired cues from Robert Heinlein's classic sci-fi novel to create a special-effects extravaganza that functions on multiple levels of entertainment. The film might be called &quot;Melrose Place in Space,&quot; with its youthful cast of handsome guys and gorgeous women who look like they've been recruited (and in some cases they were) from the cast ofBeverly Hills 90210. Viewers might focus on the incredible, graphically intense action sequences (definitelynotfor children) in which heavily armed forces from Earth go to off-world battle against vast hordes of alien &quot;bugs&quot; bent on planetary conquest. The attacking bugs are marvels of state-of-the-art special-effects technology, and the space battles are nothing short of spectacular. ButStarship Troopersis more than a showcase for high-tech hardware and gigantic, flesh-ripping insects.  Recalling his childhood in Holland during the Nazi occupation, Verhoeven turns this epic adventure into a scathingly funny satire of fascist propaganda, emphasizing Heinlein's underlying warning against the hazards of military conformity and the sickening realities of war. It's an action-packed joy ride if that's all you're looking for, but Verhoeven has a provocative agenda that makesStarship Troopersas smart as it is exciting. The DVD includes an above-average commentary by the director and Neumeier, several deleted scenes, a behind-the-scenes documentary and promotional featurette, cast bios, production notes, and more.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0018CWWA0", "B0001XAOQ6", "B0088X7YMS", "B00D3LA7G0", "B00005N7Z1", "B00070FX5U", "0800195175", "B001ECDVKE", "B00005JA8B", "B00004Y87O", "B0000844I8", "B00008G8LY", "B004P7CN5O", "0441783589", "B00008G8M4", "0780622650", "B00003L9CQ", "B004P7CN7W", "B001JFZ118", "B003XURDAY", "B00I9TDMRM", "B001ILHY1I", "B0002CHK1S", "B00IMYVCGW", "B00000ILDD", "B009YQJ322", "B00000G3PA", "0767817478", "B0088X7YU0", "079284646X", "B000068MC3", "B000P0J09C", "B007STBUHI", "B007D5E7C2", "B004L9GMBC", "B002NZK5U0", "B00026ZG10", "B0045HCJ0S", "B00E8G5HQE", "B00009ATIX", "0783227434", "0780619951", "B000QXDED6", "B00D7AM6M0", "B00006JDVV", "B00AEFY3MC", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B0085A9J18", "B0000959N0", "B004P7CMOQ", "B00005JLQN", "B000RW3VCK", "B0004Z33G4", "B0000UJL96", "B0009JE6G6", "B000JJ4DNW", "B00005JM5B", "B000035Z38", "0767802454", "B0009MDPYM", "B005LAIH54", "B0000AOX0F", "B000VR0570", "B00AEFYDM2", "B00AEFXW8I", "0767802519", "6304711891", "B005G4TJUC", "B00AKGG828", "6305869103", "B0015RCUR8", "B000P0J0AQ", "B008CYDD7I", "0783226837", "B004SIP9Z6", "B002GHHHL0", "B0001VTPW2", "B0009X76XC", "B003J42JLC", "B00003CY6P", "B00000J11D", "B001KKU9DW", "B00AEBB9SM", "B006ZGROB6", "B00AEFXPMG", "1558908846", "B0002V7OI8", "B001VLFE7G", "B0087ZG7HK", "B0000A2ZU1", "B000A5045Q", "B008JFUQZ2", "0800141822", "B000096IAC", "B002ZG98C8", "B001B3LIOC", "B0068FZ0O2", "B000NQRR1G", "B008JFUN50"], "bought_together": ["B0018CWWA0", "B0001XAOQ6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0018CWW9G", "B0088X7YMS", "B00070FX5U", "B0090SI56Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 183809}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.55, "brand": "Sony Pictures Home Entertainment", "asin": "0767802659", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51967mHEbrL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Starship Troopers"}
{"description": "Philadelphiawasn't the first movie about AIDS (it followed such worthy independent films asParting GlancesandLongtime Companion), but it was the first Hollywood studio picture to take AIDS as its primary subject. In that sense,Philadelphiais a historically important film. As such, it's worth remembering that director Jonathan Demme (Melvin and Howard,Something Wild,The Silence of the Lambs) wasn't interested in preaching to the converted; he set out to make a film that would connect with a mainstream audience. And he succeeded.Philadelphiawas not only a hit, it also won Oscars for Bruce Springsteen's haunting &quot;The Streets of Philadelphia,&quot; and for Tom Hanks as the gay lawyer Andrew Beckett who is unjustly fired by his firm because he has AIDS. Denzel Washington is another lawyer (functioning as the mainstream-audience surrogate) who reluctantly takes Beckett's case and learns to overcome his misconceptions about the disease, about those who contract it, and about gay people in general. The combined warmth and humanism of Hanks and Demme were absolutely essential to making this picture a success. The cast also features Jason Robards, Antonio Banderas (as Beckett's lover), Joanne Woodward, and Robert Ridgely, and, of course, those Demme regulars Charles Napier, Tracey Walter, and Roger Corman.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B000003KHS", "6301792734"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 602343}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.9, "brand": "", "asin": "0767809270", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PPAS4K30L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Philadelphia [VHS]"}
{"description": "While most movie buffs are likely to callHalloweenthe best movie from John Carpenter, others--die-hard romantics and anyone who cried while watchingE.T.--might vote in favor of the director's 1984 hitStarman. It's easily Carpenter's warmest and most beguiling film, and the only one that ever earned an Oscar nomination. That honor went specifically to Best Actor nominee Jeff Bridges for his performance as an alien visitor to Earth who is knocked off course and must take an interstate road trip to rendezvous with a mothership from his home planet. To complete this journey he assumes the physical form of the dead husband of a Wisconsin widow (Karen Allen) who responds first with fear, then sympathy, and finally love. Carpenter's graceful strategy is to switch the focus of thisE.T.-like film from science fiction to a gentle road-movie love story, made believable by the memorable performances of Bridges and Allen. It's a bit heavy-handed with tenacious government agents who view the Starman as an alien threat (don't they always?), but Carpenter handles the action with intelligent flair, sensitivity, and lighthearted humor. If you're not choked up during the final scene, well, you just might not be human.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B007G8SEF2", "B000QXDCJ2", "B0024FADAQ", "B00005JKIS", "B00020HAV0", "630471193X", "B0001I562I", "6305869103", "B0000844I8", "B0000648ZQ", "B00020HAWE", "0783232047", "B005FQ2H8W", "B00009AOBK", "B002GOAGZC", "B00008438U", "B00AEFXT7W", "B0045HCJKS", "B005QX8U2Q", "B001BGS17Q", "B0003JANU0", "B003ASLJMW", "B000EHRVOW", "B002GHHHKQ", "B00000G3PA", "B004AOECXI", "B00AEFY3MC", "B0000UJDLM", "B0015NORDW", "B00004TX5G", "B00008G8LY", "B000065U1Q", "B00004W46I", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00008G8M4", "B00015YVD6", "B00005JKFR", "B001ECDVJU", "6305428506", "B0045HCJSA", "B00AEBB8VK", "B0087F7VSY", "B0013LL2Z2", "B0025VLELQ", "B002GHHHNI", "B00009AOBI", "B00005JPD0", "0767821467", "B000EHSVOG", "B00GJNQ4M0", "B000JU8H9C", "B00004YA66", "B00009PY3X", "B0068FZ0GK", "B0045HCJ9E", "B0002V7OI8", "B000VECAD0", "6305213283", "B000FO0A9W", "630542845X", "0784011338", "B000096IAC", "B004SIP6C2", "B0001NBLYK", "B00066FBQG", "0783225814", "B00000IQW5", "0800195175", "B00AEFY4CG", "6305236569", "6305308853", "B00009OWJY", "B000FO0AA6", "0792844866", "B000NJMJGG", "B000MDFTHE", "B00AEFYXJ0"], "bought_together": ["B0024FADAQ", "B000QXDCJ2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0024FADAQ", "B000QXDCJ2", "B000VECAD0", "B000OA8OK4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15141}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.38, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "0767812166", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5111TSVWTWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Starman"}
{"description": "Bill Murray was heading toward a career peak on the back of comedies such as this one from 1981, the second film in his ongoing collaboration with director Ivan Reitman (the two went on to makeGhostbusters). Murray plays a chronic loser who joins the army and fails to find a fan for his ironic sensibilities in his by-the-book sergeant (Warren Oates). When push comes to shove, however, the smirking hero takes charge of his ragtag unit and turns them into fighting machines, albeit to the rhythm of hit songs by Manfred Mann and Sly Stone.

His hostilities toward women may turn some viewers off, but his wife, Aline, seems to be a grounding point, and she provides a solid counterbalance to the man.  No one shies away from discussing incredibly intimate things (namely, sex!), which explains much of R. Crumb's cartoons.

This time around, the dramatics and  conclusions fall into place a little too well, instead of finding life's  little accidents along the way. Everyone now looks a bit too cute and oh,  so nice. As the matron, Marmee, Susan Sarandon kicks the film into a  modern tone, creating a movie alive with a great feminine sprit. Kirsten  Dunst (Interview with the Vampire) has another showy role. The young  ensemble cast cannot be faulted, with Ryder beginning the movie in a role  akin to light comedy and crescendoing to a triumphant end worthy of an  Oscar.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003VA3JW2", "B0084CATVQ", "B000E0WJOG", "0800141660", "B004SIP7AS", "B004UOHNCA", "B000E1ZBGS", "B002GIBVV6", "B00005YNTR", "B0007LXPAY", "0553212753", "B00006ZXSK", "B00005Y7AN", "B00AEBB8YW", "1402712367", "B000002AZK", "6304765266", "B00062IZ0Y", "B0007NMHNS", "0141192410", "1497432529", "B000YDBPAM", "6310292196", "B0006419KA", "B00004TJKK", "B004XVMCMQ", "B000URDCC6", "6304698623", "B00005R5GB", "B00386EZKE", "B00005RRGB", "B001NY6YTI", "B001C4AFOY", "B0000VCZKM", "B00G6HO3OA", "B000LPQ6DE", "B001KWRBH2", "B000FKPDWK", "6305212112", "0767020294", "B00009RDGF", "B0000542C7", "B00005TPMM", "B002NZK5RS", "B004P7CNZO", "0783230486", "B0013D8LH2", "B000FFL2H0", "B004U7MQZ6", "B000VBIGCW", "0486296342", "0767821769", "B000M06KJ8", "B004A8ZWVK", "144042358X", "1402713193", "6305213283", "B0045HCJJY", "0767836324", "B000784WMW", "B000209KMW", "B000FO0AA6", "B00AEFXYOA", "B000Z27HLS", "B001BPVB5G", "B006H37P2K", "B000MQC9H4", "B00015YVD6", "B000HT3PGU", "6304711913", "B000641D2Y", "B00003CXC3", "B000OYCM5I", "B0002KVIKY", "B004499LWG", "B000RPCK2E", "B000068TR1", "B003VS0CX8", "B003TY2SWC", "B000059XV6", "B001PJRAUS", "B000N4SHOE", "0767819659", "B002ZG988M", "B001GCUO0W", "B00005JPH2", "B00063KGPU"], "bought_together": ["B000E0WJOG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004UOHNCA", "B000E0WJOG", "B003VA3JW2", "B000E1ZBGS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 4249}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"], ["Musical Instruments", "Studio Recording Equipment", "Computer Recording"]], "price": 14.97, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "0767851013", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Dh-cFqKtL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Little Women (Collector's Series)"}

Forget the tawdry sequels; this highly original, almost surrealist work stars Robert Englund as a mutilated monster who kills teenagers during their dreams. Craven, who only directed one Elm Street sequel (Wes Craven's New Nightmare), takes the Hitchcockian step of layering in psychological explanations for the terror and then proving them all irrelevant in the face of mindless evil. The horror in the film is emotionally raw, in contrast to the overimaginative set pieces of most of the sequels that followed; and the final scene is as deeply unsettling as anything Luis Bu&ntilde;uel ever committed to film.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300214087", "B00023NRSM", "B0000039A6", "B00000JQTO", "6302975832", "6303396585", "630018403X", "0792836634", "0784011923", "0790700506", "B00000JQTR", "6301589025", "6302166926", "6300182878", "6301961404", "6300263681", "B00005JA8B", "6300184269", "6300267881", "6300214311", "6305095566", "B00000JQTQ", "0790742322", "B0000VCZMU", "0780607287", "0790705141", "6300214192", "6300214605", "6303506291", "0792839234", "630026999X", "6302921058", "0783235607", "6304509154", "6304288433", "B00000ILE6", "6300214656", "6300218058", "6302038308", "6301094352", "6302968143", "B00000JGEI", "6303257879", "6303265693", "0792846303", "630428845X", "6300247171", "B000005XXG"], "bought_together": ["6300214087", "B00023NRSM"], "also_viewed": ["0792836634", "B000BRKTL2", "0780627032", "B00023NRSM", "6300214087", "B000RIWAVW", "B0000039A6", "6302921058", "6302975832", "B00005LC4Q", "B000FA57UI", "6303396585", "0790705141", "B00AZ7V0W0", "B0089N4G50", "B00000JQTO", "6300182878", "0790700506", "6304288433", "B000FA57US", "6305095566", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B000VKL6Z2", "6301792769", "B001DJLD1W", "630428845X", "6300214192", "6304983794", "B00D7AM71A", "B000FS9FE4", "6304509154", "630229648X", "6301792734", "B00DEQQK8S", "6303265693", "0767817664", "B000RRJOPS", "6303257879", "0780630858", "B00000K3TO", "6301961404", "6304240562", "0783235607", "B0000VCZMU", "B0001611DI", "6301708695", "0780630866", "6300247171", "B00004SVYQ", "B00FN5Z8UY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 392902}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.92, "brand": "", "asin": "0780619412", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BTBTJRFDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Nightmare on Elm Street [VHS]"}

{"description": "Coasting on the successes ofGods and MonstersandGeorge of the Jungle, Brendan Fraser turns in yet another winning performance in this fish-out-of-water comedy in which Pleasantville meets modern-day Los Angeles, with predictably funny results. Fraser stars as Adam, who was born in the bomb shelter of his paranoid inventor dad (a less-manic-than-usual Christopher Walken), who spirited his pregnant wife (Sissy Spacek, in fine comic form) underground when he thought the Communists dropped the bomb (actually, it was a plane crash). Armed with enough supplies to last 35 years, the parents bring up Adam inLeave It to Beaverstyle with nary any exposure to the outside world. When the supplies run out, and dad suffers a heart attack, Fraser goes up to modern-day L.A. for some shopping and long-awaited culture shock. More of a cute premise with lots of clever ideas attached than a fully fleshed out story,Blast from the Pastis also supposed to be part romantic comedy, as the hunky Adam hooks up with his jaded Eve (Alicia Silverstone) and tries to convince her to marry him and go underground. The sparks don't fly, though, because Silverstone is saddled with the triple whammy of being miscast, playing an underwritten character, and suffering a very bad hairdo. Fraser, however, carries the film lightly and easily on his broad, goofy shoulders, mixing Adam's gee-whiz innocence with genuine emotion and curiosity; only Fraser could pull off Adam's first glimpse of a sunrise or the ocean with both humor and pathos. Also winning is Dave Foley as Silverstone's gay best friend, who manages to make the most innocuous statements sound like comic gems.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005RIJ3"], "bought_together": ["B00005RIJ3"], "also_viewed": ["B00G5G7EXY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 277212}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0780626478", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513Y40DFZ6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blast From the Past [VHS]"}

{"description": "What if you were asked to investigate a murder in which you were the prime suspect? From this seemingly impossible notion comes a grandly entertaining nail-biter. Charles Laughton plays the punctuality obsessed, slave-driving head of a publishing empire who won't let his crime magazine's star editor (Ray Milland) take a day off to spend with his family. The overworked Milland, having just upset a delayed honeymoon trip for the umpteenth time, goes on a sorrow-drowning, bar-hopping bender with a mysterious woman who, it turns out, is Laughton's mistress. Later that night after Milland has gone home, Laughton murders her, and the next day he assigns Milland to investigate, since a number of clues point to her having spent time with another man that night. Milland, then, must not only find the real murderer but sidetrack the investigation away from himself. That both characters are solving the crime in tandem yet unwittingly working toward pinning the murder on each other is at the heart ofThe Big Clock's labyrinthine brilliance. Helping bring out the dark humor in this adaptation of Kenneth Fearing's noir novel (included in the Library of America's Crime Novels collection) is Elsa Lanchester as a high-strung painter who can sketch the prime suspect (Milland), a time-bomb plot device that only adds to the already unbearable suspense. This is a taut, lean thriller, superbly handled by director John Farrow, who never fails to remind his audience through repeated use of clocks, timepieces, and watches that all too often in our lives that ticking sound is the enemy.

{"description": "This 1981 television miniseries, based on Ernest K. Gann's historical novelThe Antagonists, is a dramatization of a documented revolt by nearly a thousand Jerusalem Jews against Roman oppressors in A.D. 72 to 73. Following a city-wide siege by Rome's soldiers, Jewish Zealots move into a fortress in the mountains of Masada, from which they present a defense strong enough to convince the enemy to negotiate. Peter O'Toole, in all his golden dignity,  plays Cornelius Flavius Silva, commander of the Roman legions, and Peter  Strauss is Zealot leader Eleazar ben Yair. Both are outstanding as  representatives from each side trying, in good faith, to find a way out of  the deadlocked situation. Unfortunately, neither realizes that Rome has no  intention of yielding, resulting in one of the greatest tragedies in Jewish history. A strong cast of character actors--David Warner, Barbara Carrera,  Timothy West, and Anthony Quayle--is rewardingly watchable, the action and  sets are persuasive without overwhelming the story's human dimension, and   direction by Boris Sagal (The Omega Man) is crisp and enthralling.

An ambitious, epic, utterly mind-boggling--and, let's admit it, all-out weird--adaptation of Frank Herbert's classic science fiction novel,Duneremains one of the most controversial films in the director's exceedingly provocative career.

Think Shakespeare'sHenry IVwith a dash ofTremors, and set in another galaxy. But despite plenty of strangely whispered voice-overs that explain the characters' thoughts (and endlessly detailed exposition), storytelling is not really among the film's strong points.

{"description": "Winner of seven Academy Awards including Best Picture, Director, and Screenplay, this critical and box-office hit from 1973 provided a perfect reunion for director George Roy Hill and stars Paul Newman and Robert Redford, who previously delighted audiences withButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Set in 1936, the movie's about a pair of Chicago con artists (Newman and Redford) who find themselves in a high-stakes game against the master of all cheating mobsters (Robert Shaw) when they set out to avenge the murder of a mutual friend and partner. Using a bogus bookie joint as a front for their con of all cons, the two feel the heat from the Chicago Mob on one side and encroaching police on the other. But in a plot that contains more twists than a treacherous mountain road, the ultimate scam is pulled off with consummate style and panache. It's an added bonus that Newman and Redford were box-office kings at the top of their game, and while Shaw broods intensely as the Runyonesque villain,The Stingis further blessed by a host of great supporting players including Dana Elcar, Eileen Brennan, Ray Walston, Charles Durning, and Harold Gould. Thanks to the flavorful music score by Marvin Hamlisch, this was also the movie that sparked a nationwide revival of Scott Joplin's ragtime jazz, which is featured prominently on the soundtrack. One of the most entertaining movies of the early 1970s,The Stingis a welcome throwback to Hollywood's golden age of the '30s that hasn't lost any of its popular charm.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00066FBQG", "B00023P4R4", "B0019UGYK0", "B000CEXEWA", "B00008OE4W", "B000063US2", "B00441GYOM", "B00079Z9VO", "B000MNOX94", "0783240171", "B002VWNIAY", "B00001W9G0", "0792838408", "B0008ENHUI", "B006FE83UE", "B0008ENHTO", "6305128952", "B00BTYU3SK", "B000087F6M", "B00AEFXD1O", "B00407PNY2", "B00003CXBU", "B0045HCJ9E", "B00004XPPC", "B00AEFY66U", "B000ZM1MG4", "B004SEUJOQ", "6304907729", "B00008CMSX", "B0010YVCI4", "B000EHSVS2", "B00AKGG5WG", "B000FZETR0", "B00871C09S", "B0049985XW", "B0068FZ0GK", "B00005A06N", "0783226039", "B003LMPKSQ", "B000W1SZBS", "B00AEBB932", "B007STBUHI", "B00005MEOU", "B002HK9IDQ", "0767818105", "B000XJD34I", "B00008K76U", "B0000JBALO", "B0052YDMZE", "B00006ADD5", "B0087ZG7R0", "B002M2Z3BA", "B00003CXB5", "B00AEFY9GW", "B003L16F7C", "B000EHRVOW", "6304712936", "B003ZEQMH8", "B000RPCK2E", "B001KXZGO6", "B0006GAO5Y", "0790731886", "B000KX0IOU", "B000I0QL82", "B00008UALL", "B00AEBBA0E", "B0010AN7Z4", "B000YDBPAM", "B004SIP7F8", "B0000AM6IY", "B000FO0AA6", "B000BITV92", "B002VWNIBI", "B001LMAK88", "B00AATUZLU", "B0000CBY1C", "B002VWNID6", "0783225733", "B001EJW0SG", "B00006RCO1", "B007Y1NR1W", "B000O78L00"], "bought_together": ["B00066FBQG", "B0019UGYK0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00066FBQG", "B000MNOX94", "B0010YVCI4", "B00079Z9VO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30100}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.99, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "0783225873", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Nmqp86vQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Sting (Full Screen Edition)"}

{"description": "In this wicked thriller from 1992, director Brian De Palma shamelessly borrows from Alfred Hitchcock (as usual) and several other filmmakers to create a shock-a-thon that plays like a film buff's highlight reel from a dozen different thrillers. Taken on those terms it's a lot of fun to watch (though not for the faint-hearted), and multiple maniac roles for John Lithgow make it an irresistible shocker that isn't afraid to wallow in its own excess. Lithgow not only plays the evil Dr. Carter Nix, who is performing strange experiments on children, but he also plays the doctor's twin sons, Josh and Cain, who kidnap kids and bring them to their father's laboratory. Lolita Davidovich is a mother whose child has been abducted, but she won't give up without a fight. If this sounds repulsive, rest assured that De Palma focuses on the battle between the mother and the nefarious twins (this isn't a film about gratuitous child abuse), and film students will delight in the allusions to Hitchcock, Michael Powell'sPeeping Tom, and Orson Welles'sTouch of Evil,among others. It never makes much sense or adds up to anything truly satisfying, but thanks to Lithgow's wild performancesRaising Cainis the kind of over-the-top thriller that grabs you for 95 minutes and holds you in its entertaining grip.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005K3NU", "B000H5TH1Q", "B00005LIRC", "B00005K3NV", "B000U1ZV76", "B00803PG44", "0790776960", "B003TTBA0S", "B00004W3HG", "B00005LIRB", "B000XT1P4S", "B003JSSPUM", "6304884400", "0790742446", "B000KGGJ04", "B0058O1FES", "B00AEBB8JM", "B00KPP6R9S", "B000ELL1R6", "B008DVJOQ4", "B00HVOFP12", "B00KE3B6NI", "B000244GCW", "B00006L92X", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B0009GX1CE", "B000Q66Q8I", "B00C2CDJ34", "B000TUDBFW", "B00EVU3S4U", "B008DVJNTW", "B000E5N684", "B0009298N4", "B00HW3EJ6Y", "B0003JANWS", "B00005JOJE", "B00062IVJ4", "B00JQYV0B4", "B003JSSPV6", "B00EVU3T26", "B004YCKIZW", "B000HT38B2", "0780624890", "B003TRMLQM", "B004CQZFIU", "B000HC2M0C", "B00C7A8WZQ", "B000YDOOSM", "B005CFC0MO", "B004JPJHL0", "B00008L3S6", "B00AEFYD2M", "0790732149", "B0043X1FNQ", "630523650X", "B00AEFXR8I", "B005ZVINFS", "B00013RC66", "B000069HZO", "B000U1ZV7Q", "B004P7CN3G", "B0009X768W", "B00000FYSU", "B00CQRNKKM", "B00005JO5L", "B00HRISNPM", "B002AMVEII", "B00IKM5MIA", "B0050MB5KM", "B004FUPK3I", "B00AEFYF2K", "0783116926", "B00009Y3QI", "B00003JRAV", "6305090564", "B000096I9V", "B002I41KNC", "B00092ZLSK", "B00005JP4N", "6305308837", "B000PMFRYC", "B00AEFXKZ8", "B00D97DMBU", "B005OT810I", "B0012KSUTK", "B00D9EJFV4", "B00BOWOBTO", "B00005UM28", "B000S0GYRK", "0767802616", "B00803PFZO", "B00FJYXP36", "B00HT2RTU6", "0780625528", "B001UDS4BS", "B00AEFXBPM", "B00GHH9GSC", "B008XAT0VO", "B002NN7EY2", "B000CR76U8"], "bought_together": ["B00005K3NU", "B000H5TH1Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005K3NU", "B00803PG44", "B000CPHAB0", "B00006L92X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 137117}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.62, "brand": "UNIVERSAL", "asin": "0783228449", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41WCzRKKcJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Raising Cain"}

Soon, it's brother-in-law against brother-in-law in an uproarious and hilarious fight to the finish to see which one really knows how to enjoy The Great Outdoors.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB9E6", "0783227388", "0790740044", "B000GCFNZO", "B00004RJ73", "B00441GYQ0", "B005XB8SLE", "B00287Z18Y", "B007P9HW3M", "B002O3Z4YI", "0783233515", "B000K7VHTQ", "B00ID3TPBQ", "B000065V3P", "B0071HPOHY", "0767821467", "B000065U1D", "6305236569", "0792844866", "B0000A14TA", "B000P0J09W", "B00158K0QU", "B005LL817W", "B000VBIGD6", "B00005T7HZ", "B00015YVD6", "B00AEBBA2C", "B00007GZQZ", "078322740X", "B005QX8UEE", "B00AEFXIUK", "B00AEFXXMI", "076780760X", "B00AEBB9DW", "B00009W5F3", "6305428387", "B0019HQICW", "0792844890", "B008R65XKQ", "6305428050", "B000EHQU08", "B00AEFXDO6", "B000QFCD7W", "B00008G8LM", "B001AEF6C2", "B00008DDXA", "B0068FZ0GK", "B004DOTKDM", "B001AGXEAG", "0790742071", "B00008DDXK", "B00028HBES", "6305162018", "B0043X1FLI", "0783231032", "B00407PNZ6", "B0000AVH9Q", "B00AEFY0F2", "0767836359", "B000Z8GZYW", "B000E8QVCY", "0767818105", "B008M4C1BC", "B00009AOAZ", "B0009X75WE", "B0009PVZ9Q", "B0000CBY1C", "B00003CXC3", "B00005T7I2", "B0000JBALO", "B002ZG97TW", "B00005PJ6O", "B00AEFYT94", "B000063UR3", "B000FO0AA6", "B005XB8SGO", "B000PHX5P0", "B000A6T230", "B00BTYRB2G", "B000MRNWK6", "0790742012"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBB9E6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008R65XKQ", "B00AEBB9E6", "0790740044", "B000GCFNZO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3237}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.99, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

{"description": "The original cowriter and director ofFear and Loathing in Las Vegaswas Alex Cox, whose earlier filmSid and Nancysuggests that Cox could have been a perfect match in filming  Hunter&nbsp;S. Thompson's psychotropic masterpiece of \"gonzo\" journalism. Unfortunately Cox departed due to the usual \"creative differences,\" and this ill-fated adaptation was thrust upon Terry Gilliam, whose formidable gifts as a visionary filmmaker were squandered on the seemingly unfilmable elements of Thompson's ether-fogged narrative. The result is a one-joke movie without the joke--an endless series of repetitive scenes involving rampant substance abuse and the hallucinogenic fallout of a road trip that's run crazily out of control. Johnny Depp plays Thompson's alter ego, \"gonzo\" journalist Raoul Duke, and Benicio Del Toro is his sidekick and so-called lawyer Dr. Gonzo. During the course of a trip to Las Vegas to cover a motorcycle race, they ingest a veritable chemistry set of drugs, and Gilliam does his best to show us the hallucinatory state of their zonked-out minds. This allows for some dazzling imagery and the rampant humor of stumbling buffoons, and the mumbling performances of Depp and Del Toro wholeheartedly embrace the tripped-out, paranoid lunacy of Thompson's celebrated book. But over two hours of this insanity tends to grate on the nerves--like being the only sober guest at a party full of drunken idiots. So while Gilliam's film may achieve some modest cult status over the years, it's only becauseFear and Loathingis best enjoyed by those who are just as stoned as the characters in the movie.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006H32EI", "B006ISJQ1W", "B00003CXWV", "0767837398", "B002AF4Y9G", "B000A7DVR2", "B001EDFSIQ", "0679785892", "B0057ZAA6W", "6305313687", "B00029RTAI", "B0007DFJ0G", "B002QEHPQU", "B00008975Z", "B001HN69AY", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00005JM23", "B000F7CECK", "B000JMK6LW", "B000093FLA", "B000P0J09M", "B003HKN52U", "0783225903", "B00005R87R", "B004SIP95G", "B00000IRE6", "B000031EFY", "B00005ATQB", "B005Y4I6VW", "B0006HBZE2", "B00005Q4CS", "B004FQX5B6", "B009NNXQJW", "B0000VD04M", "B00006JDU8", "B00005V9HH", "B00011CZRE", "B002T9H2LA", "B000C20VPA", "B002CPMB9O", "B000AXWHSA", "B000ASDFI6", "B000P0J0D8", "0792838068", "B003W88QVC", "B00029RTCG", "B0011E5M66", "B0007PALZ2", "B00005JMJG", "B007D0FVRM", "B001J9KJ4I", "B006ISJQBM", "B000EMGJAO", "B0000CDUT5", "B000KB4898", "B0000AC8LR", "B004P7CNC2", "B004SIP7TE", "B00AEFXE9U", "B004SIP8ES", "B00AEFYS2M", "B000C20VRS", "B0000AC8LI", "B00ALU48M0", "B0009A40ES", "B000LP6KNU", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00AEBB8NI", "B0000640VJ", "B004SIP6LS", "B000286RP2", "B000GGSMC6", "0780621611", "B001HN694K", "B00009W5CA", "B004XVMCH6", "B001GCUO0W", "B000GBEWGQ", "B0006GAOJA", "B008R65XYC", "B000IY04Q8", "B000006NN1", "B000S6M1Y4", "B0012E2GFK", "B0007UC8Y4", "B0043X1FM2", "B0001CNRRU", "B00ALU46VI", "0767835093", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005NTOH", "B000MMMT9G", "B005LAIIJY", "B00AG4714S", "B00000K3TS", "B000053VAZ", "B00009MGEM", "B001M4YZ90", "B002ZG980U", "1451659717"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXWV"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0679785892", "B00029RTAI", "0783225903", "B000A7DVR2"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3274}, "asin": "0783229526", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51LL2U2I2AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"}

{"description": "Following the blockbuster success ofThe Exorcist, director William Friedkin had the clout to make any film he wanted, and he nearly ruined his career makingSorcerer, an ill-fated remake of the classic French thrillerThe Wages of Fear. Given the big-budget treatment that Friedkin could command, the original plot remains unchanged: In an unnamed Latin American country, Roy Scheider leads a group of four fugitives who will earn their freedom if they can successfully transport truckloads of volatile nitroglycerine over treacherous terrain to extinguish a raging oil fire. The unstable explosives could prove deadly at any point of the journey, and numerous obstacles threaten the completion of the mission. Produced under rugged conditions in the jungles of the Dominican Republic, the film is visually impressive and contains intense moments of astonishing suspense, but the specter of the superior French version hangs over every scene. This version remains a folly of directorial ambition run amuck, but for the very same reasonSorcereris a film that's hauntingly unforgettable, fueled by an atmosphere of dread and the forceful powers of nature. Presented in full-screen format on DVD, the film is aided immeasurably by Tangerine Dream's eerie electronic score.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000AQKUH2", "B005Q5WM6O", "B00JV0547O", "B000EHSVR8", "B00005JLJW", "B00I116MVQ", "B00JA3RVG4", "B00IARA8KM", "B004DSCMLA", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00IKM5OCO", "B00KSQ0N44", "B00HYRYO5O", "B00GOT11TA", "B00I0CAVWW", "B00H96KG2U", "B0008KLVA0", "B00I45844W", "B00K7IPFSM", "B00J0IN6Z4", "B00K2CHX9C", "B00J11U54K", "B00IKM5LXG", "0792838947", "B0000VLLHK", "B00KHWSB5M", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B000N3SROU", "B001PYD0KM", "B00JL6L4UY", "B00L4K450G", "B00I116MZ2", "B00JU949TK", "0061775126", "B00ICWO1LC", "B00KIZY2QA", "B00BEJL6JK", "B00004REAG", "B00J5JSV3A", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B00HW3F0X0", "B00J4LMHMK", "B0006TPDPM", "B0009GX1CE", "B00H8J2NTC", "B00CUKTHES", "B00097DY2A", "B00HW3LAF2", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00HHYF570", "B00JBGSHSQ", "B00DL48BM6", "0615928315", "B00HRJVHIQ", "B00IKM5NJS", "B00I9BU60Q", "B00GS08Y3Q", "B00005IA7Z", "B00IKM5LFY", "B0007ZEOC8", "B00H7BJ0C4", "B00K2CHW48", "B00J81S92S", "B00HEPDGKA", "B00JQYV0B4", "B00KHA99BY", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00KM9LY3Q", "B003INBNOS", "B00IKM5MIA", "B00HEPC0TS", "B00JLDTBCU", "B00GBT62PQ", "B00HRISNPM", "B00005U2KC", "B00H9HZITU", "B00HF00RJW", "B00HQF9TFO", "B00H91LWDC", "B00HVOFP12", "B00DPUB56U", "B00HQFA1VA", "B00J5LXST0", "B0000EYUCK", "B000HWZ4D4", "B00HRJVHOU", "B00JVQ7PWU", "B00HUCF420", "B00005LIRC", "B00GOT1BHC", "B00GMV8JVI", "B00HF98SPS", "B00H83EUQW", "B00EL6A8IS", "B00HEPE6MM", "B00H96KFV2", "B00JAGF9E2", "B00J5G1P2W", "B0006UEVVS"], "bought_together": ["B000AQKUH2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["6305999872", "B00K7IPFSM", "B00JVQ7PWU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 72224}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 39.95, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

{"description": "The only real problem withStir of Echoeshas nothing to do with the movie itself, but with unlucky coincidence. Adapted from a Richard Mathesonnovel, this film  arrived around the same time asThe Sixth Sense, and surface similarities made it suffer by cursory comparison and the competing film's phenomenal success. It's a pity, because this one features one of Kevin Bacon's best performances, in a psychological thriller that makes a lot more right moves than wrong ones. Bacon plays a blue-collar guy who laments his ordinary life, only to learn, when his sister-in-law (Ileanna Douglas) hypnotizes him, that he is a \"receiver\" capable of seeing spirits and split-second glimpses of past and future events. It's a torturous gift to have--especially since his friendly Chicago neighborhood possesses a dark secret--and Bacon plays the role with an appropriate mixture of obsession and internalized torment.Similarity toThe Sixth Senseapplies only to the basic premise and the character of Bacon's young son. Otherwise, this is more of a hard-edged journey of self-discovery, marital crisis, and recovery, with Bacon's wife (played by the highly underrated Kathryn Erbe) involved in an underdeveloped subplot about a group of people who share Bacon's gift as paranormal \"receivers.\" Furthering his career as a writer-director of intelligent thrillers, David Koepp makes a few missteps in pacing and thematic overkill, but overallStir of Echoesis a sharp, sensitive thriller that unfolds to reveal a dramatically satisfying solution to its mystery.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBBA2W", "B00004BZIY", "B00006AUJR", "B000VKKV3K", "B004SIP92O", "0800177789", "B00005JNY3", "6305718954", "B00007AJE1", "B000TJ6PBK", "B0001FR3IQ", "B00003CXKA", "B00AEFYYH6", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B0000648X0", "B002NZK5RI", "B00005JL3T", "0783222149", "B000V4UFZK", "B003VA3JUO", "B00003CWRF", "B000HT38IK", "B00009WVSL", "B0097C046W", "B00005JH9M", "B00008DDGY", "0783116926", "B004LWZW24", "B004AC6PV2", "B00008EY9G", "B0009X763M", "0783226837", "B0021L8UFI", "0783240295", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00011CZRE", "B00005UQ9W", "B004EPYZO4", "B002DKGWSE", "B0021L8UXA", "B0024FADD8", "B003ASLJQS", "6305161933", "155890848X", "B0001GF2D8", "B00064LJVE", "B009XTF8KQ", "B000Y7U97I", "B002GHHHN8", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00005JKZH", "B002JT69IW", "0767817737", "B00AEFYF2K", "6304711891", "B00KU2ZKKI", "0792840127", "B005LAIGOQ", "B001KKU9CI", "B001JNNDJM", "B00AZTUUQK", "B000U7169M", "B00026ZD04", "B002VWNIDG", "B002O3Z4WK", "B00AJLHUA8", "B003L20IEW", "B0002IQLHQ", "B000AM4P9K", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00IJS2OR2", "B00009PY4G", "B000OVLBGM", "B001BP4K22", "B001R3YRG2", "B0002234LS", "B0000694XX", "B00B96TGQS", "B002AT8K9W", "B000NIVJF4", "B000HC2LFI", "6305065551", "B00AIBZKV0", "B00013RC7K", "B004SUDQDG", "0792159659", "B000GFLKF8", "B0021L8UPS", "B00AEBB91E", "B000PMLJMQ", "B0001IMCFC", "B002NZK5SM", "6305428115", "B000LP6KNU", "B00006FDCD", "6304806434", "B00AEFXKZ8", "B008Y1YK7G", "B0006SGYL0"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBBA2W", "B00004BZIY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004SIP92O", "B004AC6PWG", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00004BZIY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 163731}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.99, "brand": "Lions Gate", "asin": "0784013470", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71YSZMKZKXL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Stir of Echoes"}
{"description": "Because it was released less than a year after Oliver Stone'sPlatoonand within months of Stanley Kubrick'sFull Metal Jacket, this exceptionally well-made film about one of the bloodiest battles of the Vietnam War was largely overshadowed and overlooked. It's a pity, because in some respects this is the best of the Vietnam films of the late 1980s, at least in terms of the everyday authenticity it depicts. Stripped clean of dramatically extraneous narrative, the movie opts instead for a straightforward approach to its day-by-day account of one of the war's costliest victories--a deadly siege on Hill 937 in the Ashau Valley, where soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division engaged the enemy over the course of eleven brutal assaults between May 10th and 20th, 1969. The film specifically follows the 3rd Squad, 1st Platoon, a mixture of \"new guys\" and battle-weary \"short-timers\" who fought against terrifying odds and suffered a 70% casualty rate. From first scene to last,Hamburger Hilltraces the rise and fall of their battle experience, from the horror of firefights to the camaraderie of men who've faced death and survived. Racial tensions flare and subside, trusts are established, and courage emerges from unexpected places. Through it all, writer Jim Carabatsos and director John Irvin maintain a purity of focus that pays tribute to the soldier's life without promoting false patriotism or gung-ho theatrics. In addition, the film features a cast full of talented and well-known actors in the early stages of their careers, including Dylan McDermott (from the TV series \"The Practice\") and Don Cheadle, before gaining fame inDevil in a Blue DressandBoogie Nights. Color accuracy, image clarity, and the explosive soundtrack have been remarkably preserved in a flawless DVD transfer, lending even greater immediacy to this underrated film.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["079284646X", "B000P0J09C", "B00AEBBA36", "B00AEBB86U", "B000ELL1R6", "B007HCI42A", "B003ELKNH2", "B00005PJ8T", "B0007TKNDI", "B003ASLJOU", "B006TTC5HC", "B00001ZWUS", "B005FUTC1I", "B004U7MQWY", "B0002V7ON8", "B0089J289K", "B000065U1N", "B00005JK8K", "B00AEFXVCU", "B00005JPKE", "B000095WW8", "B000M4RG42", "B00004ZBVG", "B000UJ48UO", "B000B8QG22", "B000DZIGDU", "B00BTYNXL4", "B003BV8ID6", "0792841662", "0792839730", "B00AEBB9O6", "B002EAYDUC", "B000WMA6R8", "B00003CXTG", "B0007TKNLA", "B000O599YO", "B00AEFXRRO", "B000MRA542", "B006TTC5DQ", "B0007TKNGA", "B0014VPFPO", "B004SIP81Q", "B002GHHHPQ", "B00AEFXLKC", "B007RL2R9M", "B004X60QRE", "B003ASLJPE", "B000KGGIZK", "B000BRP4BM", "B00AEFYBA6", "B004DY1VIO", "B00006CXSS", "B005LAIGYQ", "B002OGMGV4", "B00HEPE6MM", "B00005N5S3", "B0007KIFGE", "B001PO55LE", "B00005U8F4", "B000EOTUSA", "B00BY0EBK0", "B005ZEM8YC", "B003ASLJRC", "B00275EGWY", "B0027VK15Y", "B000G0O5N2", "B005BSCPY0", "B000NTPG6Q", "B00005PJ8S", "B00005JN9P", "6305225788", "0767802470", "B003ASLJO0", "B0001GF2FQ", "B000RTB0R6", "B0004Z33EG", "6304711905", "B0001Z3I12", "B000U1ZV6M", "B00008974J", "B001IBIHQ4", "B0015XHP2C", "B00005AVZU", "B009GXTFNK", "B005DTZXMI", "B00031V21M", "B00CHYSSME", "B00102F5WK", "B004BVS2BI", "B00DDY45DI", "6304765258", "B001ULAUF8", "B00004XPPG", "B00BTYJYR6", "B00319ECI8", "B000O77QD8", "B000EHSVS2", "B00096S4BM", "B0004Z33F0", "B003XMKU16"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBBA36", "079284646X", "B000P0J09C", "B007HCI42A"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 291696}, "asin": "0784012148", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41NV639360L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hamburger Hill"}
{"description": "This first commercially available video version of the legendary 26-second \"Zapruder Film\"--the 8mm record of John F. Kennedy's 1963 assassination, which was filmed by Abraham Zapruder--provoked a storm of controversy when it first appeared on video shelves. Added to the National Film Registry in 1994, this historical document remains a significant record of one of the nation's most devastating events and is still cited as a key piece of evidence in the debate over the truth of Kennedy's murder. This unprecedented release has been digitally mastered with the approval of the Zapruder family. An accompanying documentary, which explores the mastering process in detail, features a short portrait of Zapruder and a fascinating history of the film's official and unofficial showings up to the present. The tape also includes a frame-by-frame analysis of the film, a chronology of events, and additional historical video. This short film is still too gruesome and upsetting for many to watch, but Abraham Zapruder's famous home movie remains to this day one of the most controversial pieces of filmed history.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["1492248177", "193806710X", "0786034270", "1616082917", "1897244673", "0806514442"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 431017}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.97, "brand": "", "asin": "0788600222", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SVZJNK29L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Image of an Assassination: Zapruder Film [VHS]"}

{"description": "Director William Friedkin was a hot ticket in Hollywood after the success ofThe French Connection, and he turned heads (in more ways than one) when he decided to makeThe Exorcistas his follow-up film. Adapted by William Peter Blatty from hiscontroversial bestseller, this shocking 1973 thriller set an intense and often-copied milestone for screen terror with its unflinching depiction of a young girl (Linda Blair) who is possessed by an evil spirit. Jason Miller and Max von Sydow are perfectly cast as the priests who risk their sanity and their lives to administer the rites of demonic exorcism, and Ellen Burstyn plays Blair's mother, who can only stand by in horror as her daughter's body is wracked by satanic disfiguration. One of the most frightening films ever made,The Exorcistwas mysteriously plagued by troubles during production, and the years have not diminished its capacity to disturb even the most stoical viewers.

{"description": "Stanley Kubrick'sThe Shiningis less an adaptation of Stephen King's bestselling horror novel than a complete reimagining of it from the inside out. In King's book, the Overlook Hotel is a haunted place that takes possession of its off-season caretaker and provokes him to murderous rage against his wife and young son. Kubrick's movie is an existential Road Runner cartoon (his steadicam scurrying through the hotel's labyrinthine hallways), in which the cavernously empty spaces inside the Overlook mirror the emptiness in the soul of the blocked writer, who's settled in for a long winter's hibernation. As many have pointed out, King's protagonist goes mad, but Kubrick's Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is Looney Tunes from the moment we meet him--all arching eyebrows and mischievous grin. (Both Nicholson and Shelley Duvall reach new levels of hysteria in their performances, driven to extremes by the director's fanatical demands for take after take after take.)The Shiningis terrifying--but not in the way fans of the novel might expect.

{"description": "It's enlightening to view Tim Burton'sMars Attacks!as his twisted satire of the blockbuster filmIndependence Day, which was released earlier the same year, although the movies were in production simultaneously. Burton's eye-popping, schlock tribute to 1950s UFO movies actually plays better on video than it did in theaters. The idea of invading aliens ray gunning the big-name movie stars in the cast is a cleverly subversive one, and the bulb-headed, funny-sounding animated Martians are pretty nifty, but it all seemed to be spread thin on the big screen. On video, however, the movie's kooky humor seems a bit more concentrated. The Earth actors (most of whom get zapped or kidnapped for alien science experiments) include Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Annette Bening, Pierce Brosnan, Danny DeVito, Martin Short, Sarah Jessica Parker, Rod Steiger, Michael&nbsp;J.

{"description": "After Hammer Studios' tremendous success withThe Curse of Frankenstein, they struck a deal to adapt Universal's catalog of classics and set their sights first onDracula. Christopher Lee removes the monstrous makeup from the earlier film and makes his entrance as an elegant, confident, altogether seductive Dracula, a frightening figure of flashing eyes and erotic allure. Peter Cushing, with his hawklike profile and piercing eyes, turns his rationalist intensity to Van Helsing: man of science as crusading vampire hunter. Director Terence Fisher and screenwriter Jimmy Sangster make a few changes to Bram Stoker's tale; gone are Renfield, Transylvania, howling wolves, and transformations into bats. The Count is an old-world aristocrat firmly ensconced in a castle in England and Van Helsing a crusading vampire hunter who plots his demise with an elaborate plan. This is the first film to really mine the erotic appeal of vampires: Dracula seduces Mina and Lucy like a devil tempting good to the dark side through sex--more suggestive than explicit, but daring for 1958. Lee is electric as the ferocious Count, despite his limited screen time, and Cushing turns Van Helsing into a virtual swashbuckler of a hero, leaping and diving through the climax like an aging action hero. Cushing reprises his role inThe Brides of Dracula, while Lee absented himself from the series until 1966'sDracula: Prince of Darkness.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["1564427099", "0790736098", "0790736071", "6302814707", "6302503507", "6305095566", "6303149189", "6300208052", "6300183092", "0792845552", "6300183629", "6300181278"], "also_viewed": ["0790736098", "1564427099", "0790736071", "B00BPX7K5Y"]}, "price": 59.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 607938}, "asin": "0790736101", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513ZKF03WDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Horror of Dracula [VHS]"}
{"description": "Actor Griffin Dunne improves a bit on his first film as a director,Addicted to Love, with this drama-comedy about a family of witches. Nicole Kidman and Sandra Bullock play spell-casting sisters of different temperaments: the former is a high-living, free-spirited sort, while Bullock's character is a homebody who can't get around a family curse that kills the men in their lives. A widowed single mom, Bullock gets into a jam with an abusive Bulgarian (Goran Visnjic) and is helped out by her sibling, but the result brings a good-looking, warm, inquisitive cop (Aidan Quinn) into their lives. The film has a variety of tonal changes--cute, scary, glum--that Dunne can't always effectively juggle. But the female-centric, celebratory nature of the film (the fantasies, the sharing, the witchy bonds) is infectious, and supporting roles by Dianne Wiest and Stockard Channing as Kidman and Bullock's magical aunts are a lot of fun.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305428042", "B000FFJYBG", "B00004W4UD", "B002NZK5RS", "B00006ZXSQ", "0425190374", "B00000DAGF", "6304765266", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B00006ZXSK", "B000CEV3M8", "B00AEFXYOA", "B002K0WBXW", "B00004UEDQ", "B00007E2F5", "0783235380", "B0000524E5", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00008NRI7", "B00005JNY3", "B005FH1RRI", "B001AGXEAG", "0783225482", "B000NA1WDQ", "B00004TJKK", "B0007Z9R66", "B000YDBPAM", "B0000714BP", "B00081U7HC", "B007TBJUW2", "B000765IJK", "B003PIUIJC", "B0002W4UDE", "B002SYAGNC", "B002ZG976U", "B00066FB2A", "B0000AOV4I", "B0007PLLBU", "B000056T4I", "B00002SSKI", "B002NZK5VO", "B002GOAH10", "B000BNX3B4", "6305428395", "B002AS464Q", "B008F283VS", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B0047685GO", "B0038N9X3Q", "630587493X", "6305236569", "B00AEFXO8Q", "6305212112", "B00000JGHN", "B00AMEZDJW", "B00006ZXSL", "B000HEWEE4", "B00068GTK6", "B000MQC9H4", "B0007Z9R5W", "B000067J1O", "B004SIP92O", "B00465I16K", "6305433925", "6305428425", "630471193X", "0399140557", "B002O3Z50G", "B002GOAGZC", "B0000DIXDR", "B000P0J08S", "B00005JPD0", "B004GSVXCG", "B0007ZEOD2", "B001CFEBW0", "B00AEFXZJE", "B00AEBB8NS", "B000A343RI", "B001Y8DJVE", "B00441GYVK", "B00AEBBA72", "B0036TGSIK", "B004SIP8LG", "B00DCRE87O", "B000QGDY0G", "B000Y9PC7S", "B002AT8KAG", "B000NA1WE0", "B0032XNKY0", "B002GHHHNI", "B00005JLNZ", "B005F2JRUC", "B004SIP8JI", "B0045HCJGC", "B0009OL7Z4", "B000V4UFZK", "B00AEFY4CG", "B002JT69IW", "B00001PE4D", "B004499LWG"], "bought_together": ["6305428042"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003F1804E", "6305428042", "B005FH1RRI", "B002NZK5RS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 34642}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.22, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "0790740060", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/416BJPBTHBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Practical Magic (Snap Case Packaging)"}

{"description": "Adapted from a hit Broadway play by Robert Sherwood and starring original cast members Leslie Howard and Humphrey Bogart, this 1936 suspense drama is set in an aging desert roadhouse caf&eacute;, where a young woman (Bette Davis) dreams of escaping a dead-end existence spent with her father and a lunkheaded, would-be suitor. Along comes a penniless poet (Howard), a wanderer who has made a mess of his life and crossed the hot sands as a symbolic act of meaningful futility. Davis's waitress is instantly enchanted, and in short order they begin talking about heading out to the world together. Then a twist: the world comes to them--in the form of escaped convicts, led by the monosyllabic Duke Mantee (Bogart), who secretly agrees to the poet's request that the fugitive gangster kill him. Directed by Archie Mayo (The Great American Broadcast), much of the film, perhaps inevitably, looks set-bound. Most of the action occurs in the caf&eacute;, and the script's tension sadly dissipates a bit as villains and hostages stay glued to their seats. The film's enduring appeal has everything to do with the leading performances: the fascinating alchemy of Howard's ethereal air, Davis's sexy urgency, and Bogart's bemused menace. If the story feels a trifle dated and perhaps a bit smug, the actors make it compelling nonetheless.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301976983", "6301968948", "0790743159", "B000BWIZRW", "6301973291", "6302952581", "6302011027", "6301968891", "6302548438", "079074886X", "630254842X", "6302360978", "6300183890", "6301978110", "6303364772", "B0000068EE", "6301798503", "6301797906", "6304429274", "0792839846", "B00005Q4GZ"], "bought_together": ["6301976983"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 608098}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.59, "brand": "", "asin": "0790747219", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PBHHMJ5YL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Petrified Forest [VHS]"}

{"description": "After the Oscar-winning The English Patient, writer/director Anthony Minghella attempted another tricky literary adaptation with The Talented Mr. Ripley, which features heartthrob Matt Damon cast against type as a psychopathic bisexual murderer. Tom Ripley (Damon) is a bright and charismatic sociopath who makes his way in mid-'50s New York City as a men's room attendant and sometimes pianist, though his real skill is in impersonating other people, forging handwriting, and running second-rate scams. After being mistaken for a Princeton student, Tom meets the shipping tycoon father of Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law), who has traveled to the coast of Italy, where he's living a carefree life with his father's money and his beautiful girlfriend, Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow). Dickie's father will pay Ripley 1,000 dollars plus his expenses if he can persuade Dickie to return to America. As Ripley and Dickie become friends, Tom finds himself both attracted to Dickie and envious of his life of pleasure. In time, he decides that he would rather be Dickie Greenleaf than Tom Ripley, so rather than go back to his life of poverty, Ripley impulsively murders Dickie and assumes his identity. The Talented Mr. Ripley was based on the first of a series of novels featuring Tom Ripley written by Patricia Highsmith; the story was previously filmed in 1960 as Purple Noon, with Alain Delon as Ripley.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000E33VWW", "B004SIP71M", "B0014GI6I2", "B00112S8RS", "B0013XZ2QK", "B008220DGE", "B002LVVCJY", "B00008WI9N", "B001P3SA8K", "B0060ZJ7DA", "B00018D40O", "B00AQBDU4Q", "B00003CWTI", "6305803765", "B0000BXMZ8", "B000PAAJZ6", "B00005BCK9", "B009D004TA", "B00008K7AO", "B00320J6WS", "B00000IC7G", "B002AT8KAG", "B00AEFXE9U", "B0006GW2JU", "B00GUO2SKA", "0393332144", "B00AQTY3JO", "6305781095", "B00005JMW7", "0783226845", "B00000G02H", "B00G7QPXUI", "B000M341SC", "B0060ZJ7BC", "B0009W5IMO", "B00H9KKGTO", "B000P5FH3K", "B00077BOFG", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B000HRMAPE", "B000BOH904", "B0036TGSR6", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00H9L26AA", "B004SIP7F8", "0788815490", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B004SUDQ22", "B0000VD02Y", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00562D3Y2", "B000A7DVR2", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B004SIP8W0", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00AMEZDK6", "B00005LIRC", "B000QGEB1M", "B000059XTI", "B004SIP6QI", "B000189LE2", "6305213305", "B0000640VK", "B000EQHXNW", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B001MSYH7Q", "B00D2CYU2W", "B000NIVJFY", "B00005JKN2", "B002ZG9800", "B00079Z9VO", "B00005R87R", "B000034CZA", "B00AEFYC96", "B008220DIC", "0792844807", "B004SIP73U", "B000MZHW40", "B0007UC8Y4", "B0016Q2D66", "6305065551", "B0045HCJ8K", "B00006RCNY", "B0010X8NF0", "B0001DCYUU", "6305781052", "B00005V5NU", "B0012OX7EO", "B000P0J0D8", "B00008G7UL", "6305428239", "0792846443", "B0045O2PHS", "6304696515", "B000F1IQN2", "B00GM7STPI", "B00AEFY8MM", "B00003CWRX"], "bought_together": ["B000E33VWW", "B004SIP71M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00JAQJMJ0", "0783225903", "B002ZG97RE", "B009D004TA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 52816}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.79, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "0792165020", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516X8NQJ30L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Talented Mr. Ripley"}
{"description": "When the theatrical release of James Cameron'sTitanicwas delayed from July to December of 1997, media pundits speculated that Cameron's $200&nbsp;million disaster epic would cause the director's downfall, signal the end of the blockbuster era, and sink Paramount Studios as quickly as the ill-fated luxury liner had sunk on that fateful night of April&nbsp;14, 1912. Some studio executives were confident, others horrified, but the clarity of hindsight turned Cameron into an Oscar-winning genius, a shrewd businessman, and one of the most successful directors in the history of motion pictures.Titanicwould surpass the $1&nbsp;billion mark in global box-office receipts (largely due to multiple viewings, the majority by teenage girls), win 11&nbsp;Academy Awards including best picture and director, produce the best-selling movie soundtrack of all time, and make a global superstar of Leonardo DiCaprio. A bona fide pop-cultural phenomenon, the film has all the ingredients of a blockbuster (romance, passion, luxury, grand scale, a snidely villain, and an epic, life-threatening crisis), but Cameron's alchemy of these ingredients proved more popular than anyone could have predicted. His stroke of genius was to combine absolute authenticity with a pair of fictional lovers whose tragic fate would draw viewers into the heart-wrenching reality of theTitanicdisaster. As starving artist Jack Dawson and soon-to-be-married socialite Rose DeWitt Bukater, DiCaprio and Kate Winslet won the hearts of viewers around the world, and their brief but never-forgotten love affair provides the humanity that Cameron needed to turnTitanicinto an emotional experience. Present-day framing scenes (featuring Gloria Stuart as the 101-year-old Rose) add additional resonance to the story, and although some viewers proved vehemently immune to Cameron's manipulations, few can deny the production's impressive achievements. Although some of the computer-generated visual effects look artificial, others--such as the sunset silhouette ofTitanicduring its first evening at sea, or the climactic splitting of the ship's sinking hull--are state-of-the-art marvels. In terms of sets and costumes alone, the film is never less than astounding. More than anything else, however, the film's overwhelming popularity speaks for itself.Titanicis an event film and a monument to Cameron's risk-taking audacity, blending the tragic irony of theTitanicdisaster with just enough narrative invention to give the historical event its fullest and most timeless dramatic impact.Titanicis an epic love story on par withGone with the Wind, and like that earlier box-office phenomenon, it's a film for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305123616", "6304117752", "6301792734", "6303215734", "B00000JS61", "6304178352", "6303396623", "6303314015", "B00003CXTF", "0769403468", "6301734734", "6302936381", "6303300480", "6305368139", "B00005RRG3", "6302610702", "0792839846", "6300207919", "B000P0J0C4", "6304546262", "B000056BRF", "6304400551", "6303101267", "630150528X", "6303637574", "B000P0J0EW", "6305126062", "6302935148", "0800199421", "6304681496", "0792116887", "6301963911", "B0000DCGT1", "B00001IVED", "6305169187", "B00006RCST", "6300216721", "630197879X", "0800113055", "076780922X", "080010367X", "0800141326", "0800184319", "6304039522", "B000066AXC"], "bought_together": ["6305123616"], "also_viewed": ["B009VQHDSQ", "6303314015", "B0074JODXU", "B00003CXTF", "B003JQZXWW", "6302787068", "6301796535", "0788812807", "0788806270", "B00005JKDQ", "6304500831", "6305229449", "6304117752", "6300213668", "6304089767", "B0000AQZYM", "079213690X", "6303049079", "6305123616", "6303402348", "6301792734", "0788812408", "B00079HZSE", "B000035Z2S", "B00000K3AN", "0788805843", "6302526574", "B0000029YC", "6303534422", "6303215734", "B0070285YE", "B00008LDO9", "0783216084", "6304434340", "B00BBND56G", "0788805533", "6300183211", "6302320402", "6305750750", "B0002CHI3S", "0790748266", "6304143184", "B0000040CM", "B005X7H9SQ", "B00004RFHF", "B00005V1Z7", "6302814782", "6301572688", "B00000JS61", "B008SLUWZG", "6303257844", "B00078XGO2", "0790736039", "B0000040EJ", "B000065U6Q", "B00003CX7L", "B00000ADKZ", "6300263673", "6302178924"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 65950}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.47, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "0792151712", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21BAWEVBJ1L.jpg", "title": "Titanic [VHS]"}

{"description": "A man calling himself Henry Faber is actually \"the Needle,\" a German spy in England bearing critical information on Allied invasion plans that he must deliver personally to the Fhrer. He's so named because of his preferred method of assassination, the stiletto. He is a coldly calculating sociopath, emotionlessly focused on the task at hand, whether the task is to signal a U-boat or to gut a witness to avoid exposure.\n\nOn his way back to Germany, a fierce storm strands him on Storm Island, occupied only by a woman named Lucy (Kate Nelligan), her disabled husband, their son, and their shepherd, Tom. A romance develops between the woman and the spy, due to an estrangement of affections between Lucy and her husband, whose accident has rendered him emotionally crippled as well.\n\nThe love affair suggests there's a sympathetic personality buried somewhere inside the Nazi spy, though he remains enigmatic. Early on, we discover that he may not enjoy the hand life has dealt him. When a courier asks him about the way he lives, and \"What else can one do?\" the Needle answers, \"One can just stop.\"\n\nLucy realizes that her lover has been lying after she discovers her husband's dead body. \"The Needle\" must get to Tom's radio in time to report to his superiors the exact location of the D-Day invasion. Lucy is the Allies' last chance. He is reluctant to harm her, but she has no such qualms and shoots him as he tries to escape in a boat. Additional footage tells of Faber's activities four years before and of David's accident, while another ending finds Lucy receiving help from British Intelligence.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005QCVP", "6303057225", "B0000040EJ", "0783240171", "6302529441", "6302700949", "6302909023", "6302238331", "6302413435", "0790743213", "0800132009", "0792837096", "6300181340", "0790733463", "6301971809", "630150528X", "6300215741", "6300185168", "6302717736", "6302529484", "6302779782", "6300216748", "630280051X", "6303451535", "6303168507", "0783221347", "079074886X", "B00024I2TK", "079284517X", "6303082866", "0783235623", "B00008R9K9"], "bought_together": ["B00005QCVP"], "also_viewed": ["B0039A9M7K", "B004CQZF8U", "0451204530", "0451215710", "0062020889", "0525953094"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 312020}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.91, "brand": "", "asin": "0792835050", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516X8HB6Y7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Eye of the Needle [VHS]"}

{"description": "One of the most rousingly enjoyable sports movies ever made, this small-town drama tells the story of the Hickory Huskers, an underdog basketball team from a tiny Indiana high school that makes it all the way to the state championship tournament. It's a familiar story, but sensitive direction and a splendid screenplay helped make this one of the best films of 1986, highlighted by the superb performances of Gene Hackman as the Huskers' coach, and Oscar nominee Dennis Hopper as the alcoholic father of one of the team's key players. As the drama unfolds we come to realize that many of the characters (including Barbara Hershey as a schoolteacher with whom Hackman falls in love) are recovering from disappointing setbacks, and this depth of character is what makes the otherwise conventional basketball story so richly rewarding. LikeRocky,Rudy,andBreaking Away, this is a quintessentially American movie about beating the odds and rising above one's own limitations.

{"description": "It is the future. Society has at last solved all its major problems, thanks to amiable lunkheads Bill and Ted and the inspiring music of their band, Wyld Stallyns. Only one man is dissatisfied with the way things have turned out, the evil De Nomolos. In an effort to change the future, De Nomolos sends evil Bill and Ted robots back in time to prevent the real Bill and Ted from winning a pivotal Battle of the Bands. What follows is a spirited journey through the afterlife as Bill and Ted try to rescue their girlfriends, save the future, and, oh, yeah, learn how to play the guitar.Bill & Ted's Bogus Journeyswings easily between childish and clever humor, and is good at both: a Bergman reference is quickly followed by an equally funny bit about Death's stinky feet. Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter seem happy to be reprising their roles and even manage to add funny spins on Evil Robot Bill and Ted. William Sadler very nearly steals the movie as Death, playing both his wounded dignity and budding desire to be funky to a T. As if that weren't enough, George Carlin returns as Rufus and Pam Grier does a cameo just for the hell of it.Bill & Ted's Bogus Journeyis ample proof that not all sequels suck.

{"description": "Dustin Hoffman plays a lowlife who happens upon a plane crash and rescues the passengers, but doesn't really care about the value of his deed or the attendant publicity when the media starts searching for the hero. Another fellow (Andy Garcia) steps into the gap and claims credit, and as his life changes for the better he takes on a messianic glow. Geena Davis is the cynical television reporter who pushes the latter's fame in order to keep her story alive, and this film, directed by Stephen Frears (Prick Up Your Ears), takes a few familiar jabs at a manipulative and voyeuristic press. This is essentially an unofficial remake ofMeet John Doe, though it is less dramatic and forceful in the end than Frank Capra's classic. Chevy Chase has an oddly anachronistic part as Davis's editor (maybe he thought he really was inMeet John Doe), but the film belongs to Hoffman, who makes his character a slightly cleaned-up version of the actor's own Ratso Rizzo inMidnight Cowboy.--Tom Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 443525}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.7, "brand": "Hero", "asin": "0800121260", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51E50H7302L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hero [VHS]"}

Gary Oldman plays the vampire, Dracula, doomed to be a creature of the night after forsaking God but aroused by the image of a British woman (Winona Ryder) who resembles his own lost love. Oldman does well by the monster, even if he doesn't register much personality in the process, and Anthony Hopkins is a little overachieving as the vampire killer Van Helsing. The rest of the cast is serviceable, except Keanu Reeves, who--not atypically--is wooden and somehow empty. Coppola seems to approach the film as chunks of experimental opportunity, some of which work out all right while others are mannered or even foolish.

{"description": "A slapstick comedy starring Chris Farley,Beverly Hills Ninjais part prop-gag movie and part testament to the late comedian's physical comedic abilities. As a baby, Haru (Farley) appeared on the coastal shores of Japan. Legend has it that a foreigner would arrive and become the greatest ninja ever, known as the \"Great White Ninja.\" As Haru grew, it became apparent: he was not the one. But when a beautiful stranger named Sally (Nicollette Sheridan) appears at the dojo seeking a ninja's help, Haru finds his calling. Through a series of mix-ups (generally caused by Haru himself), Haru is framed for murder and he follows Sally to Beverly Hills to set things right. Finding out Sally's boyfriend is a counterfeiter and murderer, Haru with the help of hotel bellboy Joey (Chris Rock) and unknowingly with the help of his ninja brother Gobei (Robin Shou) takes down the counterfeit ring and finds his place among the ninja clan.Beverly Hills Ninjais full of individual comic gags that are hilarious in their purity--call it sadistic, but sometimes it's just plain funny watching a guy unwittingly walk into a lamppost while carrying on a conversation. Farley was a master at these tried-and-true gags, which reach right back into the origins of comedy.

{"description": "Considered by many to be the greatest B&nbsp;movie ever made, the original-release version of Orson Welles's film noir masterpieceTouch of Evilwas, ironically, never intended as a B&nbsp;movie at all--it merely suffered that fate after it was taken away from writer-director Welles, then reedited and released in 1958 as the second half of a double feature. Time and critical acclaim would eventually elevate the film to classic status (and Welles's original vision was meticulously followed for the film's 1998 restoration), but for four decades this original version stood as a testament to Welles's directorial genius. From its astonishing, miraculously choreographed opening shot (lasting over three minutes) to Marlene Dietrich's classic final line of dialogue, this sordid tale of murder and police corruption is like a valentine for the cinematic medium, with Welles as its love-struck suitor. As the corpulent cop who may be involved in a border-town murder, Welles faces opposition from a narcotics officer (Charlton Heston) whose wife (Janet Leigh) is abducted and held as the pawn in a struggle between Heston's quest for truth and Welles's control of carefully hidden secrets. The twisting plot is wildly entertaining (even though it's harder to follow in this original version), but even greater pleasure is found in the pulpy dialogue and the sheer exuberance of the dazzling directorial style.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302281849", "B001BZQMFA", "0783236352", "1558807780", "0783221347", "0782008348", "630266232X", "630347327X", "6305012792", "6302655897", "6302413400", "6302413435"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 403157}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.88, "brand": "", "asin": "1558804226", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G3Y343C4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Touch of Evil [VHS]"}
{"description": "It seemed like a pretty good career move, and for the most part it was.  Demi Moore will never top any rational list of great actresses, but as her career stalled in the mid-1990s she had enough internal fire and external physicality to be just right for her title role inG.I. Jane. Her character's name isn't Jane--it's Jordan O'Neil--but the fact that she lacks a penis makes her an immediate standout in her elite training squad of Navy SEALs. She's been recruited as the first female SEAL trainee through a series of backroom political maneuvers, and must prove her military staying power against formidable odds--not the least of which is the abuse of a tyrannical master chief (Viggo Mortensen) who puts her through hell to improve her chances of success. Within the limitations of a glossy star vehicle, director Ridley Scott manages to incorporate the women-in-military issue with considerable impact, and Moore--along with her conspicuous breast enhancements and that memorable head-shaving scene--jumps into the role with everything she's got. Not a great movie by any means, but definitely a rousing crowd pleaser, and it's worth watching just to hear Demi shout the words &quot;Suck my ----!!&quot; (rhymes with &quot;chick&quot;).--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0045HCIYA", "B000F6IODE", "B00005B6JZ", "6304696558", "B00005JA9F", "6304765258", "B000KF0GWW", "B00005Y1UX", "B00000G3PA", "B000N3SRO0", "6304711891", "0792159659", "B00AEBBA36", "B0000542CK", "0790730979", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00081U7HC", "B00003CXGV", "6304806434", "B00AEFXR1K", "B00003CXTG", "B0002WZTOI", "B000065U1N", "B00003CXFV", "B000095WW8", "B0045HCJFS", "B000JYW5BE", "B002AT8K9W", "B003ASLJOU", "B0006N2EZ0", "B00AEFY4CG", "0767810872", "B00004STDN", "B002O3Z4WK", "B001B3LIOC", "B000CEV3M8", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B000U1ZV8K", "B0007KIFGE", "B004GJYRK0", "B001680M26", "B00008EYA5", "6305236569", "B00AEBB86U", "B000KGGIZK", "B002O3Z50G", "079284646X", "0783225733", "1558908846", "6305128952", "B0009UZG3C", "B00AEFYUQQ", "0790736411", "B002NZK5VO", "B00003CXHJ", "B002NZK5UU", "0790732149", "6304711905", "6305428506", "B00004WG2F", "B00096S49Y", "B00001ZWUS", "B000FI8MPW", "B00AEFXYJA", "B002GHHHJC", "0767817745", "B0002V7OI8", "0780618548", "B00AEFY0F2", "B006TTC5HC", "B000QUCRB4", "B00005JK8K", "B000PMFS2I", "B000ENC5YW", "B00HEPE6MM", "0783225547", "B00004XPPG", "6305213283", "B00005JPD0", "B002VWNID6", "B00007E2F5", "0767811100", "B005LAIGYQ", "0767815122", "B000DZIGDU", "B000274T94", "0783240295", "B00AZNEW5G", "B00006HAWN", "B0045HCJ5S", "B000O599YO", "B0068FZ0O2", "0767821769", "B00AEFXZJE", "B00009WVSL", "B000P0J0CY", "B00AEFXYOA", "B000P0J0C4", "B004SIP7ZS", "B003ASLJIQ"], "bought_together": ["B0045HCIYA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005B6JZ", "B00003CXPP", "6304696558", "B00DV2MVWO"]}, "price": 4.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7428}, "asin": "1558908315", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WE3PRTH1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "G.I.

{"description": "Judge Dreddis one of those movies that doesn't have a brain of its own, so it can only rip off a lot of ingredients from other, better movies. It's a mishmash ofBlade Runner,Total Recall, andThe Road Warrior, with a dash ofStar Warstossed in for good measure. As if that weren't enough, it's got Sylvester Stallone, who seems to be the only one in the movie who's in on the game and knows it's all a sci-fi scam. LikeThe Fifth Elementa few years later,Judge Dredddepicts a futuristic megalopolis packed with crowded vertical overgrowth and rampant commerce, where anarchy reigns supreme. Violent \"block wars\" are fought by lawless citizens with machine guns, and Judge Dredd (Stallone) is one of the city's heavily armed policemen, given free rein to judge and execute the perpetrators of violence. But Dredd himself is subjected to judgment and swift justice when his own gun is identified in the murder of a prominent TV reporter, forcing him to do whatever he can to clear his name. Diane Lane plays his partner in crime-fighting and romance, and Rob Schneider provides juvenile comic relief as Dredd's streetwise sidekick. Impressive special effects are on vivid display, and the movie's fun for what it's worth.

{"description": "Before coming to America to make such acclaimed films asTender MerciesandDriving Miss Daisy, Australian director Bruce Beresford made a lasting impression with this compelling courtroom drama, considered one the finest films of the Australian new wave of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Based on a true story about three soldiers in the Boer War who are served up as political scapegoats of the British Empire, the film uses a flashback structure to dramatize the courtroom testimony.  It begins when the three Australian soldiers are railroaded for the justified killing of a German missionary and placed on trial for court-martial not as a matter of justice, but to mollify the German government for the sake of political expediency. Burdened with a competent but inexperienced and hopelessly disadvantaged lawyer, the soldiers realize that their fate has been sealed and the outcome of their trial is a fait accompli. Unfolding with urgent precision and a riveting focus on its well-drawn characters,Breaker Morantwas the all-time box-office hit in Australia at the time of its release in 1980, and it remains one of the very best historical dramas ever made.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00BTYJYR6", "B000CJ2E5I", "B00008PC13", "1593860161", "B0045HCIZE", "B0009UVCR6", "B000EOTUSA", "B000062XF0", "B00004TJKI", "B0002CR04A", "B0000639EU", "B001CTBGNS", "0792841409", "B00108FMFO", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B00005U8F4", "B0000EYUCK", "B0011FDVGI", "B000MV90B2", "B00006JU7U", "B000UJ48SQ", "B000EHSVQO", "0767802470", "B00049QQJQ", "B00004XPPC", "B00A29HFMU", "B0000B1A58", "B000E1E2N6", "B000LPR6GA", "B00006ADD5", "0330445936", "B00IBKXSKA", "B000YENUOK", "B00K6D1QV8", "630542828X", "B00005PJ6V", "0780021134", "B001LMAK6A", "B000AQ6A0I", "B000055Y0X", "B000HWZ4C0", "B000M2E30O", "B003XTOBU0", "B00AEFZDNA", "B000GG4Y32", "B004NTC7EQ", "B00DL48BM6", "B00007G1WH", "B00008UALL", "B00005JLD4", "B005DKS1TE", "B009XTF8NI", "B000V7HFL4", "B000CCUFB0", "B000O05DSK", "B0087ZG7OI", "B003B3NV6I", "B0008GGN9I", "B00D6I7ITY", "B004HHX9XC", "B00008AOTN", "B00096S4DA", "B0046YK4KW", "B004AKNRRY", "B006FE83UE", "B00C2535TE", "B00003CXBU", "B004ALIG0G", "B00004W229", "B00824FK9W", "B0024FADBU", "B002UXYCYK", "B0000A0DTC", "B0008ENHTO", "B00005NKTH", "B005T0OY5S"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BTYJYR6", "B00008PC13", "B0000EYUCK", "B000CJ2E5I"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 104079}, "asin": "1572521775", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2BX9BSQzuL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Breaker Morant"}

The film concentrates on that threshold-of-adulthood period familiar to past and present 16-year-olds, folding together common experiences of youth (love, hassles with mom, a desire to travel) with the special burdens endured by the hero. Stoltz, absolutely unrecognizable under lots and lots of prosthetic makeup, is quite good, as are Cher (as Rocky's mother) and Sam Elliott (Rocky's father figure).

{"description": "When Samuel (Lukas Haas), a young Amish boy traveling with his mother Rachel (Kelly McGillis), witnesses the murder of a police officer in a public restroom, he and his mother become the temporary wards of John Book (Harrison Ford), a detective who's been assigned to solve the crime. After suspect lineups and mug-shot books yield nothing, Samuel, in the most memorable scene of the film, recognizes the murderer as a narcotics agent whose picture he sees in the precinct. Once Book realizes that the police chief is in on it, too, he whisks Samuel and Rachel back home to Amish country, where he himself goes into hiding as a plain Amish man. The juxtaposition between the life of the Amish and the violence of inner-city police corruption work surprisingly well for the story, and Kelly McGillis as the falling in love widow gives an almost perfect performance. Directed by Peter Weir, the film is extremely successful in drawing the viewer into its world and, accordingly, is immensely entertaining. The only thing that mars its polish is the one-dimensional, almost cartoonish handling of the upper-echelon police corruption--a subtler, more realistic treatment of this aspect of the story would have rendered the film near perfect.--James McGrath", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792116887", "B000007OY0", "6304259131", "0800125762", "6302816629", "6302238331", "6302935148", "0792133153", "6303269834", "B00000JS61", "080018789X", "630442972X", "B000003KDG", "0790743213", "6302415853", "6304071876", "079284517X", "B00005PJ8I", "6303402348", "0790748169", "6303057225", "6303637574", "6301599896", "6303942830", "B0000068ZQ", "6303020089", "6300181340", "0783235607", "6303402070", "B00007E2F6", "0790734079", "6300182479", "B00000J2L7", "6301734734", "079212569X", "6301736362", "6302909023", "0800116917", "6305126062", "6302226899", "6303696813", "6300247112", "0783226152", "B00000F5PI", "6305426678", "B000006N70", "0800132009", "6303058981", "6305012792", "B003MG6FJY", "6301976924", "5559477621", "B00005A1VH", "0783231482", "6303451462", "B000063UUP", "0792107683", "0800123506", "6304458975", "6303109950", "0790733935", "6304214502", "0792838556"], "bought_together": ["0792116887", "6302816629"], "also_viewed": ["6302380588"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 257292}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6300214567", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JAT9P45FL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Witness [VHS]"}
{"description": "AlthoughStar Trek: The Motion Picturehad been a box-office hit, it was by no means a unanimous success withStar Trekfans, who responded much more favorably to the \"classicTrek\" scenario ofStar Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. Inspired by the \"Space Seed\" episode of the original TV series, the film reunites newly promoted Admiral Kirk with his nemesis from the earlier episode--the genetically superior Khan (Ricardo Montalban)--who is now seeking revenge upon Kirk for having been imprisoned on a desolated planet. Their battle ensues over control of the Genesis device, a top-secret Starfleet project enabling entire planets to be transformed into life-supporting worlds, pioneered by the mother (Bibi Besch) of Kirk's estranged and now-adult son. While Mr. Spock mentors the young Vulcan Lt. Saavik (then-newcomer Kirstie Alley), Kirk must battle Khan to the bitter end, through a climactic starship chase and an unexpected crisis that will cost the life of Kirk's closest friend. This was the kind of character-basedTrekthat fans were waiting for, boosted by spectacular special effects, a great villain (thanks to Montalban's splendidly melodramatic performance), and a deft combination of humor, excitement, and wondrous imagination. Director Nicholas Meyer (who would play a substantial role in the success of futureTrekfeatures) handles the film as a combination ofMoby Dick, Shakespearean tragedy, World War II submarine thriller, and dazzling science fiction, setting the successful tone for theTrekfilms that followed.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300214400", "6301543408", "6303202004", "6300216802", "630021463X", "6304415346", "6300214060", "B00008OSD3", "6305587159", "6300213285", "6300213110", "B0001VL30O", "B0000A36J1"], "bought_together": ["6300214400", "6301543408"], "also_viewed": ["6300214400", "6300216802", "630021463X", "6301543408", "6303202004", "B00DB97LRC", "630273486X", "6304178352", "0792116887", "0800103106", "6303148352", "6304415346", "6300214540", "6304539274", "6304539258", "B00001WY7T", "6302877881", "B00BAXTYIA", "B002I9Z8G2", "6300213285", "B00BAXTY62", "B00DB97LCM", "B00CTSDDVO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 133455}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.49, "brand": "", "asin": "6300213803", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/414HTCFYHJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek II - The Wrath of Khan [VHS]"}
{"description": "Maybe it doesn't quite live up to its sterling reputation, and maybe the leading man and director were slightly miscast. But who cares?Roman Holidayis the film that brought Audrey Hepburn to prominence, and the world movie audience went weak at the knees. The endlessly charming Hepburn had her first starring role in this sweet romance, playing a European princess on an official tour through Rome. Frustrated by her lack of connection to the real world, she slips away from her protective handlers and goes on a spree, aided by a tough-guy news reporter (Gregory Peck). Director William Wyler, more at home with such heavy-going, Oscar-winning classics asThe Best Years of Our LivesandBen- Hur, doesn't always keep the champagne bubbles afloat, and the Peck role would have fit Cary Grant like a silk glove. But the film is great fun, the location shooting is irresistible, and Hepburn embodies an image of chic style that would rule for the rest of the fifties.

{"description": "Francis Ford Coppola took some of the deep background from the life of Mafia chief Vito Corleone--the patriarch of Mario Puzo's bestselling novelThe Godfather--and built around it a stunning sequel to his Oscar-winning, 1972 hit film. Robert De Niro plays Vito as a young Sicilian immigrant in turn-of-the-century New York City's Little Italy. Coppola weaves in and out of the story of Vito's transformation into a powerful crime figure, contrasting that evolution against efforts by son Michael Corleone to spread the family's business into pre-Castro Cuba. As memorable as the first film is,The Godfather IIis an amazingly intricate, symmetrical tragedy that touches upon several chapters of 20th-century history and makes a strong case that our destinies are written long before we're born. This was De Niro's first introduction to a lot of filmgoers, and he makes an enormous impression. But even with him and a number of truly brilliant actors (including maestro Lee Strasberg), this is ultimately Pacino's film and a masterful performance.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000003KHS", "6302158176", "6300183211", "B0019L21H4", "6300214826", "6303686796", "6303168507", "0782008348", "6303471501", "0790705141", "0790733927", "6303402070", "B00003CXE6", "B000056BRF", "6300267997", "6300181340", "B0001VL30O", "6301977815", "6305363668", "0800132009", "6304508611", "B00005B238", "6300182878", "0792845684", "6302226899", "B00005Q4GZ", "0800100832", "6304429274", "B0000A36J1"], "bought_together": ["B000003KHS", "6302158176"], "also_viewed": ["B000NTPDSW", "B0019L770A", "B000003KHS", "6302158176", "6302610702", "6300183211", "0792174909", "B00EN09FKO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 228315}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.9, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "630021639X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41807N7YNFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Godfather, Part II [VHS]"}
{"description": "Back when the  firstStar Trekfeature was released in December 1979, theTrekfranchise was still relatively modest, consisting of the original TV series, an animated cartoon series from 1973-74, and a burgeoning fan network around the world. Series creator Gene Roddenberry had conceived a second TV series, but after the success ofStar Warsthe project was upgraded into this lavish feature film, which reunited the original series cast aboard a beautifully redesigned starship U.S.S.Enterprise. Under the direction of Robert Wise (best known forWest Side Story), the film proved to be a mixed blessing forTrekfans, who heatedly debated its merits; but it was, of course, a phenomenal hit. Capt. Kirk (William Shatner) leads his crew into the vast structures surrounding V'Ger, an all-powerful being that is cutting a destructive course through Starfleet space. With his new First Officer (Stephen Collins), the bald and beautiful Lieutenant Ilia (played by the late Persis Khambatta) and his returning veteran crew, Kirk must decipher the secret of V'Ger's true purpose and restore the safety of the galaxy. The story is rather overblown and derivative of plots from the original series, and avid Trekkies greeted the film's bland costumes with derisive laughter. But as a feast for the eyes, this is an adventure worthy of big-screen trekkin'. Douglas Trumbull's visual effects are astonishing, and Jerry Goldmith's score is regarded as one of the prolific composer's very best (with its main theme later used forStar Trek: The Next Generation). And, fortunately forStar Trekfans, the expanded 143-minute version (originally shown for the film's network TV premiere) is generally considered an improvement over the original theatrical release.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300214400", "6300213803", "6301543408", "6303202004", "630021463X", "6303909949", "B0000AUHOH", "B00008OSD3", "6301792734", "6305587159", "6300182304", "B0000A36J1", "B000065U6Q", "6304415346", "6305365121", "630336568X", "0671830880", "6300214060", "6304935811", "6302380588", "6303651488"], "bought_together": ["6300213803", "6300214400"], "also_viewed": ["6300213803", "6301543408", "B00DB97LRC", "6300214400", "630021463X", "B00BAXTYIA", "B00005JLRT", "6303202004", "B00DB97LCM", "B00000ILBK", "B002I9Z8DK", "B0000AUHOH", "B002I9Z8B2", "6304415346", "6304539258", "B000USUA8Y", "B002I9Z8CG", "B0095XPZBC", "B002I9Z8GW", "B001TH16DI", "B0083TUEHY", "B00HETWFVC", "630273486X", "B000HEWEJ4", "6303909949", "6300213668"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 278050}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.79, "brand": "", "asin": "6300216802", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4164CYFHC6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek - The Motion Picture [VHS]"}

{"description": "AfterThe Exorcistsparked a lengthy trend of supernatural thrillers, this 1976 horror film scored a hit with critics and audiences for mixing gothic horror and mystery into its plot about a young boy suspected of being the personification of the anti-Christ. (No doubt it's a favorite of shock-rocker  Marilyn Manson.) Directed by Richard Donner (best known for hisSupermanandLethal Weaponfilms),The Omengained a lot of credibility from the casting of Gregory Peck and Lee Remick as a distinguished American couple living in England, whose young son Damien bears \"the mark of the beast.\" Mysterious deaths and unexplained incidents draw the attention of a photographer (David Warner), whose investigation leads to the young boy--and also to the photographer's shocking decapitation (in a scene that has since been inducted into the horror hall of fame). At a time when graphic gore had yet to dominate the horror genre, this film used its violence discreetly and to great effect, and the mood of dread and potential death is masterfully maintained. It's all a bit hokey, with a lot of biblical portent and sensational fury, but few would deny it's highly entertaining.  Jerry Goldsmith's Oscar-winning score works wonders to enhance the movie's creepy atmosphere.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300247147", "6300267881", "B00004TS0H", "6304508611", "0792846303", "6300247333", "B00096S48U", "0792836634", "B00005B238"], "bought_together": ["6300247147"], "also_viewed": ["6300247147", "B000AMW2TK", "6300247333"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 237731}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.9, "brand": "", "asin": "6300247104", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41QZ2BFBRFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Omen [VHS]"}

{"description": "Bruce Lee wrote and directedReturn of the Dragon, his third film, a mix of hard-edged kung fu and goofy humor. Once again he plays the country boy who travels to a foreign land, in this case Italy, where his restaurant-owning cousins face trouble from the local syndicate. Their strong-arm tactics have driven customers away and now threaten the family, but Lee refuses to buckle under their pressure and takes them on in a series of impressive confrontations. The film ends with a memorable showdown with world-champion karate artist Chuck Norris in the Roman Colosseum (though much of it is staged in a rather cheap studio set), a brutal, almost inhuman battle that revels in the intense punishment taken by the combatants. Norris is one of Lee's best opponents and a marvelous physical contrast: brawny and hairy, using power and blunt karate moves while lean, wiry Lee counters with speed, gymnastic prowess, and balletic grace. The mix of comedy and kung fu comes off as camp at times, but that's hardly the reason to see the film. When Lee gets into action, whether he's taking on a gang of knife-wielding thugs or dueling Norris to the death, he becomes the total focus.

{"description": "Director Francis Ford Coppola and executive producer George Lucas shared a strong desire to film the story of Preston Tucker, the man who revolutionized car design in the late 1940s, only to have his innovation squelched by the \"big three\" automakers in a legal battle between Tucker and powerful political lobbies. Coppola surely related to and sympathized with Tucker as a visionary underdog, and so this stylish, energetic film envisions \"the man and his dream\" in idealistic terms--an unabashed optimist (played by Jeff Bridges) who realizes his vision through blind faith and tenacity. Martin Landau gives a superb, heartbreaking performance as an associate who desperately wants to share Tucker's enthusiasm, but knows that corporate wolves are knocking at the door and will soon burst in with fangs bared. Joan Allen is equally good as Tucker's supportive wife, and the film's combination of dazzling costumes, production design, and the fabulous Tucker itself (of which only 50 models were made) creates an infectious atmosphere of postwar optimism. In the end, however, this fascinating film is much like Coppola himself: possessed of genius, blinded by ambition, and prone to create works of erratic brilliance. Don't take that as criticism, however; this is a sharp, underrated film about a dreamer whose dream was a worthy one, even if it only briefly came true.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300246965", "B00097E6V8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 334350}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.97, "brand": "", "asin": "6301217861", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N963ZG7HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tucker--The Man and His Dream [VHS]"}

{"description": "Seven years after he earned his first screen credit as the writer ofFast Times at Ridgemont High, formerRolling Stonewriter Cameron Crowe made his directorial debut with this acclaimed romantic comedy starring John Cusack and Ione Skye as unlikely lovers on the cusp of adulthood. The casting is perfect, and Crowe's rookie direction is appropriately unobtrusive, no doubt influenced by his actor-loving, Oscar&reg;-winning mentor, James L. Brooks. But the real strength of Crowe's work is his exceptional writing, his timely grasp of contemporary rhythms and language (he's frequently called \"the voice of a generation\"), and the rich humor and depth of his fully developed characters. InSay Anything...Cusack and Skye play recent high school graduates enjoying one final summer before leaping into a lifetime of adult responsibilities. Lloyd (Cusack) is an aspiring kickboxer with no definite plans; Diane (Skye) is a valedictorian with intentions to further her education in Europe. Together they find unlikely bliss, but there's also turbulence when Diane's father (John Mahoney)--who only wants what's best for his daughter--is charged with fraud and tax evasion. Favoring strong performances over obtrusive visual style, Crowe focuses on his unique characters and the ambitions and fears that define them; the movie's a treasure trove of quiet, often humorous revelations of personality. Lili Taylor and Eric Stoltz score high marks for memorable supporting roles, and Cusack's own sister Joan is perfect in scenes with her onscreen and offscreen brother. A rare romantic comedy that's as funny as it is dramatically honest,Say Anything...marked the arrival of a gifted writer-director who followed up with the underratedSinglesbefore scoring his first box-office smash withJerry Maguire.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300147940", "630018403X", "B000051S41", "6300183467", "6300263673", "6300214370", "0792837207", "6300184269", "6300214753", "B000068MFS", "6300214710"], "bought_together": ["6300147940"], "also_viewed": ["0800109481", "6300213986", "6300214710", "B001AEF6BI", "6300183467", "0790740222", "0767825411", "6300270033"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 257141}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6301412761", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41V8JBQ2E7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Say Anything [VHS]"}

{"description": "When Roman tribune Marcellus Gallio (Richard Burton) is sent to Jerusalem, one of his assignments is the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Marcellus, a cynical and hardened man, wins the robe Jesus wore to the crucifixion while gambling with other Roman soldiers underneath the dying savior. He later becomes convinced that his hallucinations and violent outbursts are the result of a curse received from the robe, which is now in the possession of his escaped slave, Demetrius (Victor Mature), somewhere in the Middle East. He sets out to find Demetrius in order to destroy the robe and the curse and finds faith instead, converting to Christianity. This was the first movie to be filmed in CinemaScope, and won Oscars in 1953 for costume design, art direction, and set decoration. The visual aspects of the film are stunning, and it may be worth viewing for that alone; however, the script and acting leave much to be desired, and you won't find inspiration in these areas if that's what interests you.

{"description": "Many early science fiction films are now, quite inadvertently (and in most cases undeservedly), objects of camp attention: we laugh at the silly makeup, tin-can special effects, and the naive \"high-tech\" dialogue.Planet of the Apesis no such film. Its intelligent script, frightening costuming, and savagely effective conclusion (which needs no big-budget special effects to augment its impact) remain both potent and relevant. When Colonel George Taylor (the fabulous Charlton Heston) crash lands his spacecraft on what seems to be an unfamiliar planet, he is captured and held prisoner by a dominant race of hyperrational, articulate apes. However, the ape community is riven with internal dissention, centered in no small part on its policy toward humans, who, on this planet, are treated as mindless animals. Befriended and ultimately assisted by the more liberal simians, Taylor escapes--only to find a more terrifying obstacle confronting his return home. Heavy-handed object lessons abound--the ubiquity of generational warfare, the inflexibility of dogma, the cruelty of prejudice--and the didactic fingerprints of Rod Serling are very much in evidence here. But director Franklin Schaffner has a dark, pop-apocalyptic sci-fi vision all his own, and time has not dulled the monumental emotional impact of the film's climactic payoff shot.

{"description": "Annie Hallis one of the truest, most bittersweet romances on film. In it, Allen plays a thinly disguised version of himself: Alvy Singer, a successful--if neurotic--television comedian living in Manhattan. Annie (the wholesomely luminous Dianne Keaton) is a Midwestern transplant who dabbles in photography and sings in small clubs. When the two meet, the sparks are immediate--if repressed. Alone in her apartment for the first time, Alvy and Annie navigate a minefield of self-conscious \"is-this-person-someone-I'd-want-to-get-involved-with?\" conversation. As they speak, subtitles flash their unspoken thoughts: the likes of \"I'm not smart enough for him\" and \"I sound like a jerk.\" Despite all their caution, they connect, and we're swept up in the flush of their new romance. Allen's antic sensibility shines here in a series of flashbacks to Alvy's childhood, growing up, quite literally, under a rumbling roller coaster. His boisterous Jewish family's dinner table shares a split screen with the WASP-y Hall's tight-lipped holiday table, one Alvy has joined for the first time. His position as outsider is uncontestable he looks down the table and sizes up Annie's \"Grammy Hall\" as \"a classic Jew-hater.\"The relationship arcs, as does Annie's growing desire for independence. It quickly becomes clear that the two are on separate tracks, as what was once endearing becomes annoying.Annie Hallembraces Allen's central themes--his love affair with New York (and hatred of Los Angeles), how impossible relationships are, and his fear of death. But their balance is just right, the chemistry between Allen's worry-wart Alvy and Keaton's gangly, loopy Annie is one of the screen's best pairings.

The truth is, nobody has ever made anything approaching its phantasmagoric, overheated style in which German expressionism, religious hysteria, fairy-tale fantasy (of the Grimm-est variety), and stalker movie are brought together in a furious boil. Like a nightmarish premonition of stalker movies to come,Night of the Huntertells the suspenseful tale of a demented preacher (Robert Mitchum, in a performance that prefigures his memorable villain inCape Fear), who torments a boy and his little sister--even marries their mixed-up mother (Shelley Winters)--because he's certain the kids know where their late bank-robber father hid a stash of stolen money. So dramatic, primal, and unforgettable are its images--the preacher's shadow looming over the children in their bedroom, the magical boat ride down a river whose banks teem with fantastic wildlife, those tattoos of LOVE and HATE on the unholy man's knuckles, the golden locks of a drowned woman waving in the current along with the indigenous plant life in her watery grave--that they're still haunting audiences (and filmmakers) today.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["1558808590", "6301976126", "0784011451", "0792101448", "6304212151", "1558807780", "B000003NDA", "6301966430", "6301491920", "B00000F6MH", "6304366035", "6302226899", "0790743159", "6302413435", "6301586026", "0790741431", "6300208133", "6304429274", "0783217528", "6301797906", "6301798732", "0800100832", "B000GX7MMA", "B000054OW2", "6301977815", "B000056BRF", "B0000048YO", "B001E419N8", "630266232X", "6301978110", "6302968100", "6305237115", "6301564456", "0782008348", "0792115449", "6302353785", "6301964012", "630150528X"], "bought_together": ["1558808590"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 201324}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6301973232", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/717SP3TYNML._SY300_.gif", "title": "Night of the Hunter [VHS]"}

{"description": "F.W. Murnau changed the name and ghastly appearance of his villain, but this unauthorized version of Bram Stoker'sDraculacouldn't fool the Stoker estate, and it became the center of a lawsuit that almost resulted in its complete destruction. Thankfully this masterpiece survives (though in a somewhat altered form), for despite its liberties with the novel, this 1921 horror classic remains the most beautiful and resonant interpretation of Stoker. Though the plot remains essentially the same--naive real-estate clerk Thomas (Gustav von Wangenheim) is sent abroad to finalize a sale with the nocturnal Count Orlock (the hideous-looking Max Schreck), who imprisons Thomas and travels to England to claim Thomas's beautiful young wife, Ellen (Greta Schroder), as his own--the visual realization creates a very different story. Schreck plays the vampire as a grotesque demon, with his claw-like hands, bald head and sharp, bat-like ears, and he rises from his coffin with an supernatural stiffness, like a tent pole pulled upright. When the eerily empty ghost ship carrying his coffin arrives in Thomas's home port, a river of rats pours out and spreads through the town like a plague. Perhaps the most noticeable changes from the novel are the absence of Van Helsing and the richer realization of Ellen, the would-be victim, whose innate sensibility and solemn spirituality give her a spooky connection with the vampire. With his stark, symbol-laden visual scheme and sacrificial conclusion, Murnau creates a more mythic tale than any subsequent adaptation of Stoker's novel.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000067JAW", "6300183084", "6303626424", "6300183092"], "also_viewed": ["630526323X", "B00HRUQ8X4"]}, "price": 24.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 311149}, "asin": "6302194296", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VWHHY3ZJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Nosferatu [VHS]"}
{"description": "Kevin Costner's lousy English accent is a small obstacle in this often exciting version of the Robin Hood fable. That aside, it's refreshing to have a preface to the old story in which we meet the robber hero of Sherwood Forest as a soldier in King Richard's Crusades, coming home to find his people under siege from the cruelties of the Sheriff of Nottingham (Alan Rickman). After Robin and his community of outcasts and fighters take to the trees, director Kevin Reynolds (Fandango,187) is on more familiar narrative ground, and he goes for the gusto with lots of original action (Robin shoots two arrows simultaneously from his bow in two directions). Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, as Marion, makes a convincing damsel in distress, and Morgan Freeman brings dignity to his role as Robin's Moor friend. Alan Rickman, however, gets the most attention for his scene-chewing role as the rotten sheriff, an almost campy performance that is highly entertaining but perhaps a little out of sorts with the rest of the film.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["0788802194", "0783235968", "6303909884", "0792839846"], "also_viewed": ["6302415853", "6303422926", "6302178924"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 303110}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.5, "brand": "", "asin": "6302206294", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q09JK4QNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves [VHS]"}
{"description": "Australian model George Lazenby took up the mantle of the world's most suave secret agent when Sean Connery retired as James Bond--prematurely, it turned out. Connery returned inDiamonds Are Foreverbefore leaving the role to Roger Moore and Lazenby's subsequent career fizzled, yet this one-hit wonder is responsible for one of the best Bond films of all time.InOn Her Majesty's Secret Service, 007 leaves the Service to privately  pursue his SPECTRE nemesis Blofeld (played this time by Telly Savalas), whose latest master plan involves a threat to the world's crops by agricultural sterilization. Bond teams up with suave international crime lord Draco (Gabriele Ferzetti) and falls in love with--and marries--his elegant daughter, Tracy (Diana Rigg). Bond goes monogamous? Not at first; after all he has Blofeld's harem to seduce. Lazenby hasn't the intensity of Connery but he has fun with his quips and even lampoons the Bond image in a playful pre-credits sequence, and Rigg, fresh from playing sexy Emma Peel inThe Avengers, matches 007 in every way. Former editor Peter Hunt makes a strong directorial debut, deftly handling the elaborate action sequences--including a car chase turned road rally through the icy snow--with a kinetic finesse and a dash of humor. Though not a hit on its original release,On Her Majesty's Secret Servicehas become a fan  favorite and the closest the series has come to capturing the spirit of Ian Fleming's books.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["630238060X", "6302380294", "6302510023", "6302510015", "6302510007", "B0000068SI", "6302380588", "6302510031", "6303651488", "6303651461", "630251018X", "B000006FNX", "6304047843", "6305784906", "6302510198", "630251004X", "B00004TYS8", "B00008V2VP", "B000M53GMW", "B000RPCK1U", "6304032579", "B00004RWUH", "6304038801", "B000RPCK24", "B000RPCK1A", "B000M53GN6", "B000NDEXPM", "B000M53GMC", "B000M53GNG", "B000M53GLS", "B001PPLIEG", "B000NIBUS0", "B00AQSN7HE", "B000M53GM2", "B000RPCK0Q", "B000RPCK1K", "6302824613", "630150528X", "6304429274", "6302482712", "6303202004"], "bought_together": ["6302380294"], "also_viewed": ["6302380588", "6302510015", "B00004TYS8", "B00004W9C7"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 167907}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.44, "brand": "", "asin": "6302380596", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZCDSK1KML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "On Her Majesty's Secret Service [VHS]"}

Liam Neeson plays the gentleman Nazi unwittingly providing Griffith with cover as domestic help. The best parts of the film are the twists and turns in the romance (Douglas is very good at playing a character who can turn off all feeling at will) at the beginning, while the German scenes are less compelling despite such high stakes for the heroine.

{"description": "Since Adolf Hitler had the audacity to borrow his mustache from the most famous celebrity in the world--Charlie Chaplin--it meant Hitler was fair game for Chaplin's comedy. (Strangely, the two men were born within four days of each other.)The Great Dictator, conceived in the late thirties but not released until 1940, when Hitler's war was raging across Europe, is the film that skewered the tyrant. Chaplin plays both Adenoid Hynkel, the power-mad ruler of Tomania, and a humble Jewish barber suffering under the dictator's rule. Paulette Goddard, Chaplin's wife at the time, plays the barber's beloved; and the rotund comedian Jack Oakie turns in a weirdly accurate burlesque of Mussolini, as a bellowing fellow dictator named Benzino Napaloni, Dictator of Bacteria. Chaplin himself hits one of his highest moments in the amazing sequence where he performs a dance of love with a large inflated globe of the world. Never has the hunger for world domination been more rhapsodically expressed. The slapstick is swift and sharp, but it was not enough for Chaplin. He ends the film with the barber's six-minute speech calling for peace and prophesying a hopeful future for troubled mankind. Some critics have always felt the monologue was out of place, but the lyricism and sheer humanity of it are still stirring. This was the last appearance of Chaplin's Little Tramp character, and not coincidentally it was his first all-talking picture.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302561841", "6302561949", "6302561957", "6301095294", "6302561833", "630181214X"], "bought_together": ["6302561841"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 288707}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.88, "brand": "", "asin": "630256185X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71J4N8JPWYL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Charlie Chaplin: Great Dictator [VHS]"}
{"description": "Annabella Sciorra plays a Manhattan shrink with a couple of particularly troubling patients. The most haunting is a woman (Deborah Unger) with unusually kinky sexual tastes; Sciorra gets gooned out when she realizes that her new boyfriend (Jamey Sheridan) is the same guy her patient has been seeing. And when the patient winds up dead, Sciorra begins looking slantwise at her boyfriend. Unfortunately, despite some spooky mood setting, this psychological thriller goes in circles and ends up nowhere, thanks to the implausible stretches of writer-director Christopher Crowe's script. Sciorra seems hollow at the film's center, though Sheridan brings a certain scary charisma to his boyfriend role and Alan Alda is solid as her psychiatric mentor.--Marshall Fine", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 449019}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.82, "brand": "", "asin": "6302670322", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/416N7A9AA8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Whispers in the Dark [VHS]"}

{"description": "Certain to remain one of the greatest haunted-house movies ever made, Robert Wise'sThe Haunting(1963) is antithetical to all the gory horror films of subsequent decades, because its considerable frights remain implicitly rooted in the viewer's sensitivity to abject fear. A classic spook-fest based on Shirley Jackson's novelThe Haunting of Hill House(which also inspired the 1999 remake directed by Jan de Bont), the film begins with a prologue that concisely establishes the dark history of Hill House, a massive New England mansion (actually filmed in England) that will play host to four daring guests determined to investigate--and hopefully debunk--the legacy of death and ghostly possession that has given the mansion its terrifying reputation.Consumed by guilt and grief over her mother's recent death and driven to adventure by her belief in the supernatural, Eleanor Vance (Julie Harris) is the most unstable--and therefore the most vulnerable--visitor to Hill House. She's invited there by anthropologist Dr. Markway (Richard Johnson), along with the bohemian lesbian Theodora (Claire Bloom), who has acute extra-sensory abilities, and glib playboy Luke Sanderson (Russ Tamblyn, from Wise'sWest Side Story), who will gladly inherit Hill House if it proves to be hospitable. Of course, the shadowy mansion is anything but welcoming to its unwanted intruders. Strange noises, from muffled wails to deafening pounding, set the stage for even scarier occurrences, including a door that appears tobreathe(with a slowly turning doorknob that's almost unbearably suspenseful), unexplained writing on walls, and a delicate spiral staircase that seems to have a life of its own.The genius ofThe Hauntinglies in the restraint of Wise and screenwriter Nelson Gidding, who elicit almost all of the film's mounting terror from the psychology of its characters--particularly Eleanor, whose grip on sanity grows increasingly tenuous. The presence of lurking spirits relies heavily on the power of suggestion (likewise the cautious handling of Theodora's attraction to Eleanor) and the film's use of sound is more terrifying than anything Wise could have shown with his camera. Like Jack Clayton's 1961 chiller,The Innocents,The Hauntingknows the value of planting the seeds of terror in the mind, as opposed to letting them blossom graphically on the screen. What you don't see is infinitely more frightening than what you do, and with nary a severed head or bloody corpse in sight,The Hauntingis guaranteed to chill you to the bone.--Jeff Shannon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 433958}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6302872766", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5169GTZZBNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Haunting [VHS]"}

Shore's character agrees but is given a hard time by the girl's salt-of-the-earth family of farmers. The hero and Gugino's character actually have a crush on each other, and now that they have an opportunity to explore romance, their relationship is threatened by poor Pauly's tests of rural manhood.

{"description": "After initially rejecting the role as too sentimental, Ginger Rogers found the title character ofKitty Foyleto be an Oscar winner and a career breakthrough. Released in 1940, only a year after her nine-picture partnership with Fred Astaire ended,Kitty Foylehelped establish Rogers as a nonmusical box-office star. The film portrays a white-collar working girl who receives a warm and welcome marriage proposal from Mark (James Craig), a kindly but humble doctor. As soon as she accepts, however, she receives a different proposition, this one from her former love, wealthy socialite Wyn (Dennis Morgan), who plans to flee his life and his wife and asks Kitty to join him and live in unwedded bliss in South America. Kitty then recounts her life in flashback to help her choose which man to love.

When Julius Caesar, the leader of the Roman Empire, succumbs to the charms of the sultry Cleopatra, he creates a scandal big enough to shake the marble pillars of Rome. The ruler pays dearly for his romance, for the outraged Roman Senate repudiates him and the fickle Cleopatra decides to protect her interests by bestowing her affections on her former lover's rival, Marc Antony.", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 449913}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.34, "brand": "", "asin": "6303382959", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5114QD19F5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cleopatra [VHS]"}

{"description": "Jane Fonda was so respected as a serious actress that her comedy chops sometimes were overlooked. But it should be remembered that her first real hits (Barefoot in the Park,Cat Ballou) were comedies. This underrated 1977 outing also played for laughs, though it had social-satire underpinnings that still ring true. Fonda and George Segal play an upwardly mobile couple in the time before yuppies--think of them as protoyuppies. But their status-oriented existence suffers what could be a fatal blow when hubby is maneuvered out of his job. Broke and unemployed, they become armed robbers--and discover that crime can pay for them to live in the style to which they've become accustomed. Segal and Fonda have a breezy ease as confused suburbanites who bring the same neurotic thoroughness to crime that they do to their careers. But the script (whose authors include Jerry Belson and Mordechai Richler) never uses either the Robin Hood angle or any other angle that could sustain a sharp edge; as a result, the comedy winds up more cute than knowing.--Marshall Fine", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 514908}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.74, "brand": "", "asin": "630368677X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MPQF16E9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fun with Dick and Jane [VHS]"}

{"description": "Critics were decidedly mixed about this 1996 drama from Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci, and the movie enjoyed only a brief theatrical release. Now it's best known for its early appearance by Liv Tyler as a 19-year-old beauty named Lucy who summers at a villa in Tuscany with a variety of artistic types who immediately respond to her inspirational innocence. An amateur poet who has decided it's time to lose her virginity, Lucy has come to Italy after the death of her mother, who visited this artist's refuge 20 years earlier. Several young Italian men find Lucy quite heavenly (she is, after all, Liv Tyler), and she's not immune to their attentions, but she'd rather spend time with a playwright (Jeremy Irons) who is dying of AIDS and therefore has something other than sex on his mind. The movie's plot is about as substantial as Tyler's character (she's sexy, all right, but hardly an intellectual muse), butStealing Beautycreates a serene mood that's so soothing you'll want to book a flight to Tuscany immediately, just to soak up the setting's idyllic atmosphere. If you're in the right frame of mind, this movie is like a balm for the soul, and Tyler and Bertolucci can share the credit for making this two-hour vacation so charmingly relaxing.--Jeff Shannon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 417423}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6304195281", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q2KZSS3CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Stealing Beauty [VHS]"}

His rage erupts in violent attacks on the local Vietnamese community, but when his victims fight back his gang breaks up, and Hando flees the city with his best buddy Davey (Daniel Pollock) and redheaded hellion Gabe (Jacqueline McKenzie), a rich girl runaway who turns the dynamic duo into a splintered love triangle. Writer-director Geoffrey Wright's matter-of-fact treatment of this subculture eschews social commentary for visceral immediacy. His portrait of white supremacist punks living like squatters on the fringes of Australian society is powered by coiled anger and simmering frustration, which finds its outlet in brutal fights and murderous rampages (the intense violence earned the film an NC-17 rating). The lack of moral position may bother some people, especially in light of Wright's sympathetic treatment of particular members of Hando's racist army, and the cold, hate-driven violence is sometimes hard to watch, but his vivid characters and richly drawn world create a compelling drama for adventurous filmgoers.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 551223}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6304431848", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510RV14D60L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Romper Stomper [VHS]"}
{"description": "John Frankenheimer's follow-up toThe Manchurian Candidateis as intimate and subdued as its predecessor is flamboyant and energetic. Burt Lancaster is calm and calculating as the steely-eyed military hawk General Scott, who opposes the president's (Fredric March) plan to end the cold war with a bold nuclear disarmament plan. Lancaster's longtime friend and frequent costar Kirk Douglas is his smiling, joking right-hand man, Colonel \"Jiggs\" Casey, whose easygoing manner is jolted by evidence of a possible plot to overthrow the American government. Scripted by Rod Serling from the novel by Fletcher Knebel and Charles W. Bailey, the film plays much like a classic live TV drama (the medium that spawned both Frankenheimer and Serling), with the drama arising from conversations and confrontations and the action largely limited to scenes within the Pentagon and the White House. An ominous undercurrent of danger seeps through the realistic (and often real) settings of the film, conveyed chiefly through the intensity of the excellent ensemble performances. Notable among the supporting cast are Ava Gardner as a lonely Washington socialite who was once the general's mistress, Edmond O'Brien as an amiable alcoholic senator, Martin Balsam as the president's shrewd but skeptical secretary, and underrated character actor George Macready as the wily presidential advisor.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000408I", "B00005JMA5", "6304111398", "B00004XPPE", "B0001NBMH6", "B000055Y0X", "6300268047", "6303686745", "6300181405", "0792133153", "6302990076", "630396155X"], "bought_together": ["B00000408I"], "also_viewed": ["B00005JMA5"]}, "price": 29.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 333013}, "asin": "6304457391", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B1EQE5ZKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Seven Days in May [VHS]"}
{"description": "After Martin Scorsese went to Hollywood in 1972 to direct the low-budgetBoxcar Berthafor B-movie mogul Roger Corman, the young director showed the film to maverick director John Cassavetes and got an instant earful of urgent advice. \"It's crap,\" said Cassavetes in no uncertain terms, \"now go out and make something that comes from your heart.\" Scorsese took the advice and focused his energy onMean Streets, a riveting contemporary film about low-life gangsters in New York's Little Italy that critic Pauline Kael would later call \"a true original, and a triumph of personal filmmaking.\" Starring Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel in roles that announced their talent to the world, it set the stage for Scorsese's emergence as one of the greatest American filmmakers. Introducing themes and character types that Scorsese would return to inTaxi Driver,GoodFellas,Casino, and other films, the loosely structured story is drawn directly from Scorsese's background in the Italian neighborhoods of New York, and it seethes with the raw vitality of a filmmaker who has found his creative groove. As the irresponsible and reckless Johnny Boy, De Niro offers striking contrast to Keitel's Charlie, who struggles to reconcile gang life with Catholic guilt. More of an episodic portrait than a plot-driven crime story,Mean Streetsremains one of Scorsese's most direct and fascinating films--a masterful calling card for a director whose greatness was clearly apparent from that point forward.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790733927", "6302842263", "630026887X", "B000005PPB", "6302816629", "6301564456"], "also_viewed": ["6302066891", "6303534368"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 426972}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6304457375", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CA63GNNXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mean Streets [VHS]"}
{"description": "Political heavyweights decide that Jefferson Smith (James Stewart), an obscure scoutmaster in a small town, would be the perfect dupe to fill a vacant U.S. Senate chair. Surely this naive bumpkin can be easily controlled by the senior senator (Claude Rains) from his state, a respectable and corrupted career politician. Director Frank Capra fills the movie with Smith's wide-eyed wonder at the glories of Washington, all of which ring false for his cynical secretary (Jean Arthur), who doesn't believe for a minute this rube could be for real. But he is. Capra was repeating the formula of a previous film,Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, but this one is even sharper; Stewart and Arthur are brilliant, and the former cowboy star Harry Carey lends a warm presence to the role of the vice president. Bright, funny, and beautifully paced,Mr. Smith Goes to Washingtonis Capra's ode to the power of innocence--an idea so potent that present-day audiences may find themselves wishing for a new Mr. Smith in Congress. The 1939 Congress was none too thrilled about the film's depiction of their august body, denouncing it as a caricature; but even today, Capra's jibes about vested interests and political machines look as accurate as ever.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B006FE83UE", "B0000049FG", "B00AEBB89C", "B002VWNIAY", "B001D8W7EU", "0800113047", "6303215734", "B0045HCJQW", "B0000JBALO", "0783222955", "B00000F13T", "6300181472", "1558807780", "6300181111", "6305282927"], "bought_together": ["B006FE83UE"], "also_viewed": ["B006FE83UE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 430231}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.67, "brand": "", "asin": "6304481691", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K2W1W387L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mr Smith Goes to Washington [VHS]"}

Stern delivers a winning performance as the clumsy college kid and aspiring disc-jockey-turned-demon-shock-jock, who becomes an unlikely hero as he battles station managers, network executives, and conservative \"arbiters of decency\" in the name of unfettered bad taste.

Albert Finney is splendidly hilarious in the title role of a charming womanizer who was discovered as an abandoned infant in the bed of Squire Allworthy, a wealthy landowner who named the child Tom Jones and raised him as his own. As a young man, Tom yearns for the comely daughter (Susannah York) of a neighboring squire, but his amorous adventures (including an extended food orgy that becomes the film's funniest scene) lead him to London and to a duel with a jealous husband. He's sentenced to hang, but fate intervenes.

{"description": "Halloweenis as pure and undiluted as its title.  In the small town of Haddonfield, Illinois, a teenage baby sitter  tries to survive a Halloween night of relentless terror, during which  a knife-wielding maniac goes after the town's hormonally charged  youths. Director John Carpenter takes this simple situation and  orchestrates a superbly mounted symphony of horrors. It's a movie much scarier for its dark spaces and ominous camera movements  than for its explicit bloodletting (which is actually minimal). Composed  by Carpenter himself, the movie's freaky music sets the tone; and his  script (cowritten with Debra Hill) is laced with references to other  horror pictures, especiallyPsycho. The baby sitter is played  by Jamie Lee Curtis, the real-life daughter ofPsychovictim  Janet Leigh; and the obsessed policeman played by Donald Pleasence  is named Sam Loomis, after John Gavin's character inPsycho.  In the end, though,Halloweenstands on its own as an  uncannily frightening experience--it's one of those movies that had  audiences literally jumping out of their seats and shouting at the  screen. (\"No! Don't drop that knife!\") Produced on a low budget,  the picture turned a monster profit, and spawned many sequels,  none of which approached the 1978 original. Curtis returned for two  more installments: 1981's dismalHalloween II, which picked  up the story the day after the unfortunate events, and 1998's occasionally  grippingHalloween H20, which proved the former baby sitter  was still haunted after 20 years.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005LC4Q", "B000FA57UI", "B000FA57US", "B000Q66Q2O", "B005CFC0N8", "B004P7CNUY", "B0000AOX09", "B004P7CM9Q", "B000VKL6Z2", "B00006LPHA", "B002XD0J80", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B001NPD9LS", "B002YICNE2", "B000GETUDI", "B000FS9FE4", "B001DJLD1W", "B00AEFY2LO", "B00006FI0R", "B00AEFY2WI", "B005CFBYW6", "B00006FDBT", "B00AEFY31S", "B00AEFY37C", "B00005K3NR", "B00004TS0G", "B003UGLCIA", "B0087ZG7UW", "B000I2J68M", "B000V4UFZK", "B0000VCZMK", "B0033B5XCS", "B000AM6OQ2", "B0002JP572", "B002VWNIDG", "B0058S0OMS", "B000099T3M", "B00AEFY1V0", "B002ZG971U", "B00AEFYYH6", "B00003CXCF", "B004LWZW2O", "B001B1UO6W", "B00006FDCD", "B000E1ZBIG", "B004SIP9MY", "B000TSIJWY", "B000WC3864", "B004AC6PMG", "B001DJLD0S", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B004P7CMT6", "B0002CHK1S", "B000FC2GA0", "B008CYDD7I", "B0008191WO", "B0024FADD8", "B0053TWVDC", "B00018D42W", "B00AEFY2AA", "B00DTPRZ24", "B000KJU1KK", "B00AEFY2E6", "B0000CEB6Y", "B0006SGYL0", "B00004Y87O", "B0013D8LAE", "B00005JA8B", "B006ZL1P66", "B000GBEWRU", "B000IMUYJM", "B005J9ZFQG", "B001JFZ1UE", "B007STBUHI", "B000E8M0P6", "6305972001", "B00079Z9WI", "B00005A8XX", "B00009PY4G", "B000FAOC2W", "B000AA4JL6", "B0002C4JJ4", "B0002O7XW2", "B008JFUNYG", "B000HEWEGC", "B002LMSWN2", "B00BM4Q4H6", "B000HCO86I", "B008874968", "0783227434", "B0006SSOHC", "B001JFZ122", "B004LWZW24", "B000Q66Q8I", "B00001QGUM", "B000OYCMLM", "B000PMLJMQ", "B00000ILDD", "B00A1AU72A", "B004SIP9E2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00KDU8HQQ", "B00005LC4Q", "B000VKL6Z2", "B002YICNE2"]}, "price": 19.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 349265}, "asin": "6304697961", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NXT68J3CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Halloween"}

{"description": "Annette Bening twists like a mink on a leash through Stephen Frears's adaptation of Jim Thompson's novel. This may be the perfect trope for the moral hysteria that coils around a mother, her son, and his girlfriend in this slender but highly pleasurable neo-noir. Small in effect and local in scope, the film is about small-fry, attractive, bloodless con artists who view the world as neatly split between ropers and suckers, grifters and squares. \"Grifter's got an irresistible urge to beat a guy that's wise,\" an old-timer tells Roy (John Cusack). And yet the three characters here--played by Angelica Huston, Cusack, and Bening--only beat the innocent: Lilly (Huston) gigs at the track for a mobster named Bobo, putting wads of cash on long-shot horses to even out the odds. Roy, her son, swindles citizens by dimes and degrees, flashing twenties at bars then paying for his beer with tens. His girlfriend, Myra (Bening), is hustling herself, her salad days as a long-con roper behind her.

{"description": "Lina Wertm&uuml;ller's harrowing 1976 film stars Giancarlo Giannini as a petty crook with seven unattractive sisters to support, and it features a picaresque, World War II-era journey through a prison asylum, army service, and a Nazi concentration camp. Wertm&uuml;ller is more indulgent in highbrow sadomasochism than she is real profundity, but there's no denying that the film is powerful in its story of subjugation and survival. A climactic scene in which Giannini saves his skin at the camp by seducing its disgusting female commandant is unnervingly honest.

{"description": "What do a down-and-out Broadway producer, his anxiety-attack-prone accountant, a go-go dancing Swedish secretary, and a Nazi playwright have in common? They're all part of Mel Brooks's wild and wacky first film, THE PRODUCERS. In this hysterical farce, rapacious but lovable producer Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) hasn't had a hit in years and resorts to fulfilling sexually crazed little old ladies' fantasies for extra cash. But when he meets his new meek, neurotic accountant, Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder), the two accidentally come up with a plot to oversell shares in a surefire flop musical and make off with the profits. The plan sends the new partners-in-crime on a search for the worst play ever: SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER, written by an ex-Nazi (Kenneth Mars) whose only friends are the filthy city pigeons he keeps on his roof. Inspired, manic performances by all involved, along with Brooks's lively direction--which affectionately alludes to such MGM Golden Age musicals as SINGIN' IN THE RAIN--make THE PRODUCERS both referential and highly original as it moves along swiftly to the ultimate musical climax.", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301797973", "630281622X", "6305576173", "6300247112"], "bought_together": ["6301797973"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 552537}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6305112878", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/215KFPD56ZL.jpg", "title": "Producers [VHS]"}

{"description": "If you were a kid in the early 1960s, then you sawThe Parent Trapwith Hayley Mills--it's as simple as that. Now Disney has pulled the beloved comedy--about a pair of twins who meet for the first time at summer camp and vow to reunite their long-divorced parents--out of the mothballs and remade it with a decidedly '90s feel. This time, the twins act is performed by newcomer Lindsay Lohan, who plays both Hallie and Annie, who each live with one of their parents (Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson). Adversaries when they first meet at camp, Hallie and Annie become, well, sisters when they figure out that they are siblings. The comedy springs from their efforts to sabotage Dad's impending marriage to the gold-digging Elaine Hendrix, while reintroducing Dad to Mom. Quaid has a nice, loosey-goosey way with slapstick, as does Richardson, who plays a very funny drunk scene.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000022WA", "6303998046", "080013558X", "0788812181", "6302968143", "6305229449", "0788805843", "078880782X", "B00005JMCW", "0788802194", "0788812408", "6304401132", "B00063KGPU", "6304500718", "6302787068", "0788809806", "B0000E32WB", "B00008X5J8", "6305318867", "155890641X", "6300274268", "6302320402", "6303929567", "B0002YLCHE", "B000FCW15A", "B00005T7H6", "6304500831", "0788806270", "B00005RDVV", "B0009X75QU", "B00005JKX3", "B00000IZ00", "B00001YX9H", "6305319138", "6300274195", "6302526574", "6304089201", "B00005JKDQ", "6304293968", "6303929478", "6304100507", "6305940932", "6304401736", "0788810677", "B0001906WC", "B00003CXHR", "6302961572", "6302158095", "B000063V8N", "0788810634", "B00003CXQX", "0788816454", "6303232221", "B00005JM9Q", "6300275310", "B0000A02WB", "6304089767", "6303314015", "6302642248", "6304117752", "B000209KMW", "B00003CWPW", "6302581907", "B00004XPQQ", "6304416415", "B00005T7H1", "6300214753", "B000F4PDF8", "B00005JM9P", "6303925235", "6303066720", "B00000J2JB", "630341964X", "B00003CXG6", "6304311834", "630339406X", "B00005NGTF", "B00000F8J1", "B00329TVQA", "B00006G8LB", "6302914469", "B00005JLYP", "0800196767", "B00006L97W", "B0002MB7R6", "630450389X", "6303442447", "B000A468XY", "6305009589", "B00000490M", "6302453356", "B00005JKYF", "B0000D14JV", "6304118937", "B0002KQ6UG", "B00065GWMO", "B00007AJLB", "6305515042", "B00003CXDU"], "bought_together": ["B0000022WA"], "also_viewed": ["B0009X75QU", "B0000022WA", "6303983812", "6304400551", "080013558X", "6303534422", "B00005RRG9", "0788812807", "0788805843", "0788811002", "6303315305", "B00005RRG6", "6302968143", "B000035Z2S", "6304401132", "6304089201", "6303122647", "0788812181", "B0007KTBIU", "6301390725", "B00004R99N", "6303998046", "6301948106", "0788802194", "6303442447", "6302178924", "6304285388", "B000009CH0", "B0000524CZ", "6304501153", "6303168957", "6304311834", "155890641X", "6302787068", "0788812408", "B00000JS61", "B0001I55OW", "6304100507", "B00003CXQX", "6305318867", "B008H6GH9W", "B00005JKDQ", "6305326940", "078880782X", "6303036813", "B000055ZJP", "0788811207", "6304089112", "6302320402", "6305229449", "6304293968"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 90200}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6305177473", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FFFRBR3KL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Parent Trap (Walt Disney Pictures Presents) [VHS]"}

Witnessed shocking twists of fate. Entertained aliens. Experienced dread. And first journeyed to The Twilight Zone of Rod Serling's memorable TV series. And guided by four of our most imaginative moviemakers, we traveled there again in 1983.\n\nTwilight Zone -- The Movie is a spellbinding destination, as directors John Landis, Steven Spielberg, Joe Dante and George Miller fashion stories based on or inspired by classic episodes. Landis weaves the tale of a bigot who gets a walloping dose of his own hatred. Spielberg takes over with a fable of senior citizens offered a magical rejuvenation. Dante serves up a terror trip with a child who uses his cartoon-inspired powers to enslave his family. Then fear goes aloft with Miller's finale about a neurotic passenger who sees a monster on the jetliner's wing.

{"description": "Disney's foray into big-budget science fiction, close on the heels ofStar Wars, had some of the most impressive special effects to grace theater screens in the 1970s. Graced by handsome production design--most notably a glass and latticework interstellar craft that looks like a battleship crossed with a modern skyscraper--The Black Holeis in many ways the most beautiful science fiction film of its era. Unfortunately, the graceful and gorgeous picture is jarred by dialogue that wouldn't pass muster in a comic book and a silly conclusion that plays like a murky,  dime-store knockoff of2001. Too bad, because the visual realization of  the film is a veritable haunted house of futuristic phenomena, from the cloaked zombie-like drones shuffling through corridors to the devilish, crimson robot Maximillian, the strong arm of the mad scientist played by Maximilian Schell (a kind of wild man Captain Nemo with an even more ruthless temperament). Only the way-too-cute robot V.I.N.CENT (voiced by Roddy McDowall), a merchandising gimmick that looks like a Fisher-Price toy, mars the technological landscape.  Robert Forster is the quietly authoritative captain of an exploration ship that stumbles across the seemingly derelict ship, and Anthony Perkins, Yvette Mimieux, Ernest Borgnine, and Joseph Bottoms fill out his crew. This is one case of a triumph of art direction and special effects over story--it's worth sitting through it to see the magnificent scene of the fireball rolling through the ship's enormous hull alone. The rest is just atmospheric gravy.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304509146", "6302642175", "B000005XXG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 568213}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.79, "brand": "", "asin": "6305342768", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JZSP8QV5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Black Hole [VHS]"}

{"description": "It looks like writer-director Rick Famuyiwa started a popular trend with his marriage-jitters comedy about three friends who reminisce about their lives together as one prepares to leave the group when he gets married. Everyone who rushed to seeThe Best Manshould catch this sleeper which also stars Taye Diggs (as Roland, the reluctant groom), as well as Omar Epps and Richard T. Jones, who together provide charming, cheerful performances full of warmth and humor. This buddy story is told through flashbacks to 1986, when the three met at public school. The young men gain our affection in their competition to win the most girls, which enhances the bond of loyalty we see in them as men on the eve of Roland's wedding. The casting of the boy actors is almost spooky in its perfection, especially Sean Nelson (who had already proven his acting acumen inAmerican Buffalo) as the younger version of Epps. Although the cast is African American, there's no color bar to the themes or entertainment the movie offers, providing a salient lesson to network TV producers under attack by the NAACP for their inability to include characters of color in TV shows. Instead of stereotyping the characters by placing them in \"the hood,\" where gang members and tragedy rule, this life-affirming comedy depicts the lives of members of \"the wood,\" which refers to Inglewood, a middle-class suburb of L.A. that general audiences will find easy to relate to.--Lloyd Chesley", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FS9ULC", "0800126084", "6303354734", "0780623622", "B00003L9CF", "6303022928", "0780608372"], "bought_together": ["0800126084"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 301038}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6305668426", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71FWJTPF54L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Wood [VHS]"}
{"description": "For truly clever dialogue and a smartly structured plot, you can't go wrong with Oscar Wilde. Wilde's playAn Ideal Husbandis not his best known, but this film adaptation has all the wit you could ask for and a cast with the chops to deliver it: Cate Blanchett (Elizabeth,Oscar and Lucinda), Julianne Moore (Short Cuts,Boogie Nights), Minnie Driver (Grosse Pointe Blank,Big Night), Jeremy Northam (The Winslow Boy,Emma), and especially Rupert Everett (My Best Friend's Wedding,A Midsummer Night's Dream), who tosses off perfect epigrams with unflappable aplomb. The plot hinges on Northam, a member of Parliament (the British governing body, not the funk band) with a skeleton in his closet who is blackmailed into a shady business deal by a lady of mystery (Moore), who turns out to be a loathed school chum of the parliamentarian's wife (Blanchett). Everything is resolved happily, but not until after some devious twists of fate, several mistaken identities, lots of comic banter, and much social skewering. Wilde, who came to ruin when his homosexuality was brought to light, has a sharp eye for hypocrisy and the artificial poses demanded by society--but political commentary never gets in the way of a smart laugh.

{"description": "\"I have a bad feeling about this,\" says the young Obi-Wan Kenobi  (played by Ewan McGregor) inStar Wars: Episode I, The Phantom  Menaceas he steps off a spaceship and into the most anticipated cinematic event... well, ever. He might as well be speaking for the  legions of fans of the original episodes in theStar Warssaga  who can't help but secretly ask themselves: Sure, this isStar  Wars, but is itmy Star Wars? The original elevated  moviegoers' expectations so high that it would have been impossible for  any subsequent film to meet them. And as with all theStar Warsmovies,The Phantom Menacefeatures inexplicable plot twists, a  fistful of loose threads, and some cheek-chewing dialogue. Han Solo's  swagger is sorely missed, as is the pervading menace of heavy-breathing  Darth Vader. There is still way too much quasi-mystical mumbo jumbo,  and some of what was fresh aboutStar Wars22 years earlier  feels formulaic. Yet there's much to admire. The special effects are  stupendous; three worlds are populated with a m&eacute;lange of creatures, flora, and horizons rendered in absolute  detail. The action and battle scenes are breathtaking in their  complexity. And one particular sequence of the film--the  adrenaline-infused pod race through the Tatooine desert--makes the chariot race inBen-Hurlook like a Sunday stroll through the park.Among the host of new characters, there are a few familiar walk-ons. We  witness the first meeting between R2-D2 and C-3PO, Jabba the Hutt looks  younger and slimmer (but not young and slim), and Yoda is as crabby as  ever. Natalie Portman's stately Queen Amidala sports hairdos that make  Princess Leia look dowdy and wields a mean laser. We never bond with  Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson), and Obi-Wan's day is yet to come. Jar Jar Binks, a cross  between a Muppet, a frog, and a hippie, provides many of the movie's lighter moments, while Sith Lord Darth  Maul is a formidable force. Baby-faced Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) looks too young  and innocent to command the powers of the Force or wield a lightsaber (much less transmute into the future Darth Vader), but his  boyish exuberance wins over skeptics.Near the end of the movie, Palpatine, the new leader of the Republic,  may be speaking for fans eagerly awaitingEpisode IIwhen he  pats young Anakin on the head and says, \"We will watch your career with  great interest.\" Indeed! --Tod Nelson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000633ZP", "6301792734", "B00005JLXH", "B00006HBUJ", "6304539258", "6304539274", "6301792769", "B000FQVX78", "6304539290", "0792158261", "B000FQJAJG", "6304117752", "0767729307", "B001GQSY5K", "6304178352", "B000FAGGWQ", "B00BBND56G", "B000FQJAIW", "B00005LL26", "B00003CXCT", "B00003CXI0", "B002I9Z8AS", "B00006AL1C", "B00CFWWDWE", "B000066HAS", "B000001ON6", "B000MUANT6", "6305587159"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLXH", "B00006HBUJ"], "also_viewed": ["B00006HBUJ", "B00005JLXH", "B00E9PMML2", "B0000633ZP", "6301792734", "B00BBND56G", "6304539258", "6301792769", "6304539274", "B00006JDUE", "0767729307", "B00E9PMMX0", "B000FQJAIW", "B000FQVX78", "B000FQJAJG", "B00000IQMT", "B000FAGGWQ", "B003ZSJ212", "0345434110", "6303148352", "6304089767", "0439834775", "6304117752", "B00BUZW14M", "6304500831", "0590010891", "0345341465", "6304434340", "B001GQSY5K", "155890641X", "B00005LL26", "6302961572", "0792151712", "B003W77SEO", "B000M4Y8JI", "0767825411", "B00003CXXI", "B00000IZ8A", "B00169IZN8", "6302787068", "B00006G8LB", "080010367X", "0800125762", "6302091632", "0792158261", "B000850IS6", "6300214826", "6303506291", "B00005V1Z8", "B000641D2Y", "0784011923", "B00008Y47S", "6300214060", "630382790X", "B00003CXI0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 79460}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.44, "brand": "Star Wars", "asin": "630575067X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41SJPKK4S4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Wars - Episode I, The Phantom Menace [VHS]"}

{"description": "\"Based on a (mostly) true story,\" according to the opening titles, Tim Robbins's dazzling dramatization of one of the great stories in American theater indeed takes a few liberties with history. Ostensibly the story of the mayhem surrounding Marc Blitzstein's worker's operaThe Cradle Will Rock, directed by Orson Welles for the WPA at the height of the Depression, Robbins paints a veritable mural around this incident, a city alive with plotting industrialists (John Cusack as Nelson Rockefeller), radical artists (Ruben Blades's Diego Rivera), and struggling citizens (Bill Murray's frustrated vaudeville ventriloquist Tommy Crickshaw). Lightning strikes when the government closes the show before it even opens and the cast marches  20&nbsp;blocks to an empty theater and tosses the staging aside to perform in  the aisles, the balconies, and the seats. It's a rare moment of cinema capturing the immediacy and charge of live theater on the screen and it's the heart of Robbins's often exhilarating film. His heroes are Blitzstein (a warm, gently impassioned Hank Azaria) and cheery WPA Theater director Hallie Flanagan (Broadway star Cherry Jones), but in the process he snidely turns Welles and producer John Houseman into sour, silly caricatures. The stew of artistic creation and political action gets murky and at times contradictory, but vivid performances and Robbins' driving pace and staccato crosscutting keep it humming through even the most didactic moments. Thesongsare by Blitzstein, and the  character-rich cast also features Vanessa Redgrave, Susan Sarandon, John Turturro, Emily Watson, and Philip Baker Hall.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 490653}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6305810079", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41QWVERK22L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cradle Will Rock [VHS]"}

{"description": "Considered by many to be Federico Fellini's most beautiful and powerful film,La Stradawas the first film to reveal the range of Guilietta Masina, whose poignant performance as the childlike Gelsomina recalls Chaplin's Little Tramp. The bubbly, waiflike Gelsomina is a simpleton sold to the gruff, bullying circus strongman Zampan&ograve; (Anthony Quinn) as a servant and assistant. Treated no better than an animal, Gelsomina nonetheless falls in love with the brute Zampan&ograve;. When they join a small circus they meet Il Matto (Richard Basehart), a clown who enchants Gelsomina and relentlessly taunts Zampan&ograve;, whose inability to control his hatred of Il Matto (literally, \"the Fool\") leads to their expulsion from the circus and eventually to the film's fateful conclusion. Masina is heartbreaking as the wide-eyed innocent, whose generous spirit and love of life leads her to try to \"save\" Quinn's unfeeling, brutal Zampan&ograve;. Though the film resonates with mythic and biblical dimensions, Fellini never loses sight of his characters, lovingly painted in all their frailties and failings. Fellini's lyrical style reaches back to the simple beauty of his neorealist films and looks ahead to the impressionistic fantasies of later films, but at this unique period in Fellini's career, they combine to create a poetic, tragic masterpiece.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300208591", "6301025083", "6305372594", "630347327X", "6303107338", "1572522089", "6301965752", "6302969352"]}, "price": 14.49, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 183076}, "asin": "B000001A5E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RP0J8B69L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "La Strada [VHS]"}
{"description": "Edward Scissorhandsachieves the nearly impossible feat of capturing the delicate flavor of a fable or fairy tale in a live-action movie. The story follows a young man named Edward (Johnny Depp), who was created by an inventor (Vincent Price, in one of his last roles) who died before he could give the poor creature a pair of human hands. Edward lives alone in a ruined Gothic castle that just happens to be perched above a pastel-colored suburb inhabited by breadwinning husbands and frustrated housewives straight out of the 1950s. One day, Peg (Dianne Wiest), the local Avon lady, comes calling. Finding Edward alone, she kindly invites him to come home with her, where she hopes to help him with his pasty complexion and those nasty nicks he's given himself with his razor-sharp fingers. Soon Edward's skill with topiary sculpture and hair design make him popular in the neighborhood--but the mood turns just as swiftly against the outsider when he starts to feel his own desires, particularly for Peg's daughter Kim (Winona Ryder). Most of director Tim Burton's movies (such asPee Wee's Big Adventure,Beetlejuice,Batman) are visual spectacles with elements of fantasy, butEdward Scissorhandsis more tender and personal than the others. Edward's wild black hair is much like Burton's, suggesting that the character represents the director's own feelings of estrangement and co-option. Johnny Depp, making his first successful leap from TV to film, captures Edward's childlike vulnerability even while his physical posture evokes horror icons like the vampire inNosferatuand the sleepwalker inThe Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. Classic horror films, at their heart, feel a deep sympathy for the monsters they portray; simply and affectingly,Edward Scissorhandslays that heart bare.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B001AGXEA6", "B008MU8ZM0", "B00AEBBA1I", "B00AEBB9V4", "B008UZBHYU", "B000I5XOWI", "B003UMW68Y", "B0065AO94W", "B001EZE5BU", "B008BSM1GO", "B008QE9VJI", "B0043EV774", "B00GR76W1Q", "B005LAIIA8", "B000M9BPEY", "B005DZ35RC", "B007NPKPN2", "B002UOMGZQ", "B00288KNJU", "B003M8NG94", "B004P29LEU", "B008U0XRD4", "B005DZ35TU", "B000JSI7B2", "B001O8DB1W", "B000NA22C6", "B002S6L6XY", "B000002OFD", "B004VLZUI6", "B0088EDMMS", "B005HARX4Y", "B004SIP7QC", "B001AQR3E4", "B00AJCUL2G", "B003L4Y5B2", "B0039208JE", "B0054QHHHE", "B002QEHPR4", "B0027VTMAE", "B001CO42MU", "B001AR4K8K", "B003UESJLK", "B001IKKMCW", "B000WUMLU0", "B006MOYH0M", "B00993FEUK", "B003ZHR6PW", "B00C888MJ8", "B001AQT0UY", "B00AEFXXFU", "B0039208QM", "B00164GDA0", "B005KQVDH8", "B001HN69B8", "B001D8W7CW", "B000WSLAUO", "B00005R87R", "B00FAI3JE6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001AGXEA6", "B008MU8ZM0", "B00AEBBA1I", "B008FD36IC"]}, "price": 8.5, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 449136}, "asin": "B000005QLO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511ADGQ59YL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Edward Scissorhands"}

{"description": "So who exactly was Deep Throat, that all-important source who helped Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein bust open the Watergate scandal? Well, according to this thoroughly funny, keenly smart comedy from director Andrew Fleming (The Craft), it was two sweetly daft teenage girls named Betsy and Arlene. Taking the history and figures from Watergate and running gleefully and sacrilegiously amok,Dickoffers up a hilarious what-if scenario that takes the Nixon administration's downfall from grave tragedy to hilarious farce. When Betsy (Kirsten Dunst) and Arlene (Michelle Williams) run into a shady figure in the stairwell of Arlene's Watergate apartment building, little do they know they've stumbled upon G.&nbsp;Gordon Liddy (Harry Shearer) on the night of the Democratic National Headquarters break-in. Later, on a White House field trip, they wind up meeting with Nixon himself (Dan Hedaya), who, to ensure their silence, decides to make them official White House dog walkers and \"secret youth advisors.\" Of course, Betsy and Arlene soon find out their idol has feet of clay, and ultimately decide to aid \"radical muckraking journalists\" (and queasy rivals) Woodward (Will Ferrell) and Bernstein (Bruce McCullough) in their investigation. Fleming and cowriter Sheryl Longin's enfolding of the Watergate scandal is extremely clever and inspired, from Arlene's 18-and-a-half-minute declaration of love on Nixon's tape recorder to the Hello Dolly cookies (laced with a certain herbal stimulant) that help bring about the U.S.-Soviet accord. And after all the angsty-serious portraits of Watergate, it's bliss to see the prime players sent up mercilessly; in addition to Shearer, the cast boasts Dave Foley (Erlichman), Jim Breuer (John Dean), Saul Rubinek (Kissinger), and Ana Gasteyer (Rosemary Woods), all in fine form. Hedaya's Nixon, dead-on but never parodic, is an Oscar-worthy comic turn, and Dunst and Williams invest their characters with affection and humor; the success of the film lies in the way these talented actresses make us laughwithBetsy and Arlene, never at them. Don't be put off by the teen sheen on this comedy--it's also for all of us who still remember Watergate even after 25 years, and still love dancing on the scandal's grave.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303057942"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 509409}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.95, "brand": "", "asin": "B000021Y7C", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517TQG3CXVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dick [VHS]"}

{"description": "Though set in Toronto and directed by Canadian Jeremy Podeswa,The Five Sensesevokes the emotional geography of Krzysztof Kieslowski'sTrois Couleurstrilogy. Mightn't the senses do as well as colors to signal a chance-driven world where urban isolates miss and make connections in gloomy corridors and apartments, overcast parks, rainy streets, half-finished constructions? But Podeswa's almost aimless cutting among a clutch of apartment dwellers (each identified with smell, sight, taste, hearing, or touch) is more like a warm bath in easy solutions (or sad songs) than a bracing glimpse into the human condition. A masseuse named Seraph (Gabrielle Rose,The Sweet Hereafter's bus driver) ministers to a weeping boy unable to recall when he was last touched, but she can't reach out to her own daughter (Nadia Litz), a self-loathing teen with a taste for voyeurism. Down the hall, a music-loving ophthalmologist (Philippe Volter) sinks deeper into loneliness as he begins to go deaf. Upstairs, Rona (Mary-Louise Parker), who designs gorgeous but inedible cakes, is unable to quite trust the joyously sensual appetite of her Italian-chef boyfriend. Searching for true love by smell, Rona's bisexual friend Robert (Daniel MacIvor) discovers passing pleasure in a designer perfume with the power to conjure an unexpected liaison. If this wereThe Sweet Hereafter, the fate of the little girl who goes missing at the start of Podeswa's film might shadow these \"sensualists\" into radical transformation, perhaps even parole them from the prison of self. ButThe Five Sensesnever gets that far under the skin. Still, there is something pleasantly hypnotic, even liberating, about the way Podeswa drifts lightly over surfaces, never getting caught in the net of narrative.--Kathleen Murphy", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790739267", "B0006Q948C", "B00005JMIJ", "B00000F6N8", "B006M3M5FM", "B0010DM3R4", "B0008ENIVQ", "B00023P4I8", "B0001I2BUI", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00005LPZW", "B0045HCJGW", "B004QC6HKA", "B005Z9MGRG", "B00008WJBX", "B00008K7AU", "B000FZEQCI", "B0040J1RX6", "B000ERVJPE", "B0079K4WEE", "B00H9HZITU", "B004YMATCY", "B0014GI6I2", "B004XYABMQ", "B00005Q4CS", "B0009GX1XI", "B005OZIV20", "B00DPUB59W", "B0000639HO", "0783230559", "B001EOQCMG", "B004SIP7VM", "B005KC4LNU", "B00GTZWUPS", "B0089AJELY", "B0006OJH5O", "B008GFZWGI", "0792846109", "B004HHX9OQ", "B00004U104", "B00005QW5T", "B00GMV8LIO", "B00166UFSY", "B000HEWEWG", "B004XVMCMG", "B004SIP71M", "B000E3L7DW", "B004AGN9HQ", "B00003CWQR", "B00000JWVU", "B001675Z10", "B0009XXHQ2", "B0015HZA70", "B00B2GQ0F0", "B00005BCP4", "B000A2X3SO", "B004V8W51E"], "bought_together": ["0790739267", "B00000F6N8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005LPZW", "B000FZEQCI", "0790739267", "B0008ENIVQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 140283}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.35, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00003CXMJ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YWARKX83L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Five Senses"}

{"description": "To callPearl Harbora throwback to old-time war movies is something of an understatement. Director Michael Bay's epic take on the bombing that brought the United States into World War II hijacks every war movie situation and clich&#xE9; (some affectionate, some stale) you've ever seen and gives them a shiny, glossy spin until the whole movie practically gleams. Planes glisten, water sparkles, trees beckon--and Bay's re-creation of the bombing itself, a 30-minute sequence that's tightly choreographed and amazingly photographed, sets the action movie bar up quite a few notches. And in updating the classic war film, Bay and screenwriter Randall Wallace (Braveheart) use that old plot standby, the love triangle--this time, it's between two pilots (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) and a nurse (Kate Beckinsale) who find themselves stationed at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, during what they thought would be a nice, sunny tour of duty. Then, of course, history intervened.For the first 90 minutes of the movie, Affleck and Beckinsale find a nice, appealing chemistry that plays on his strengths as a movie star and hers as a serious actress--he gives her glamour, she gives him smarts. Their truncated romance--the beginning of which is told in flashback so we can get right to the point where he has to leave her to go to England--works, thanks to their charm. They're no Kate and Leo fromTitanic(a strategy the film strives hard toward), but they're pretty darn adorable in their own right. Hartnett, as the not entirely unwelcome third wheel, squints bravely but makes only a slight dent in the film. Everyone else inPearl Harbor--from Cuba Gooding Jr.'s brave navy seaman to Jon Voight's able impersonation of FDR--is pretty much a glorified walk-on, taking a backseat to the pyrotechnics and action sequences that keep the three-hour film in fairly constant motion. But when that action does take hold,Pearl Harboris quite a thrilling ride.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792151712", "B000059HGY", "B00000K3AN", "B00AEBBA36", "0792133153", "079212569X", "6305169187", "6301734734", "0792147618", "0792116887", "6304618344", "079213690X", "6303269834", "6304925131", "6305718792", "6304259131", "B00004WIDB", "6304935811", "6303057225", "6304143184", "6302250269"], "bought_together": ["B00000K3AN", "B00AEBBA36"], "also_viewed": ["B00000G3PA", "0792151712", "6300213668", "B00000JS61", "6303215734", "6303402348", "B00004WIDB", "079213690X", "6305750750", "B004751DFU", "B00005O893", "B00000K3AN", "6301792734", "B00E5I2MCM", "6305169187", "B00007LVCM", "B007SPPANM", "B00L4K3MLE", "B00FLML7HW", "B008QZ5PY2", "B00JBGWP3Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 234413}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.49, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXTF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HC1ZDJN6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "Employing shock techniques and sound design in a relentless sensory assault,Requiem for a Dreamis about nothing less than the systematic destruction of hope. Based on the novel by Hubert Selby Jr., and adapted by Selby and director Darren Aronofsky, this is undoubtedly one of the most effective films ever made about the experience of drug addiction (both euphoric and nightmarish), and few would deny that Aronofsky, in following his breakthrough filmPi, has pushed the medium to a disturbing extreme, thrusting conventional narrative into a panic zone of traumatized psyches and bodies pushed to the furthest boundaries of chemical tolerance. It's too easy to call this a cautionary tale; it's a guided tour through hell, with Aronofsky as our bold and ruthless host.The film focuses on a quartet of doomed souls, but it's Ellen Burstyn--in a raw and bravely triumphant performance--who most desperately embodies the downward spiral of drug abuse. As lonely widow Sara Goldfarb, she invests all of her dreams in an absurd self-help TV game show, jolting her bloodstream with diet pills and coffee while her son Harry (Jared Leto) shoots heroin with his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and slumming girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly). They're careening toward madness at varying speeds, and Aronofsky tracks this gloomy process by endlessly repeating the imagery of their deadly routines. Tormented by her dietary regime, Sara even imagines a carnivorous refrigerator in one of the film's most memorable scenes. And yet... does any of this have a point? Is Aronofsky telling us anything that any sane person doesn't already know?Requiem for a Dreamis a noteworthy film, but watching it twice would qualify as masochistic behavior.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JM23", "6305594333", "B0007CEXYK", "B00005YUPD", "078401213X", "1560252480", "B00H3JHGBC", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005JMJG", "B000I0QL7I", "B0009A40ES", "B00049QQHI", "B00005ATQB", "B000LAZDPG", "B00003CXZ4", "0792838068", "B0000AC8LR", "0783229526", "6305692572", "B0041KKYEM", "B000QGEB1M", "B00008977H", "B001AR60GK", "B000MGB6NM", "B0045HCJ08", "6305313687", "B001TOD92C", "B00009Y3QI", "B000NO39FG", "B000JBXXYK", "B00008975Z", "6305162026", "B00004UEDQ", "B000068MC2", "B00606OZUY", "B00003CWQR", "B000ERVK4Y", "B000A7DVR2", "B000A9QK6E", "B00EUENWIY", "B0016MJ6T2", "B00005JPAR", "B00008MTXI", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEFXESQ", "B000JMK6LW", "B00004Y6Q5", "B000FVQLQQ", "B000BYA5G4", "B00005JKJA", "B00005JKM2", "B0029LHW68", "B000BBOUUE", "B004FQX5B6", "B000PAAJZ6", "B000N3SU92", "B003YKYX9M", "B00AEBB8O2", "B00007AJF8", "B00A2H9QN8", "B0009WFEDC", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00013RC2K", "B000A7Q2DM", "B00003CXWV", "0792845803", "B001URA5Y8", "B00195I3O0", "B00006AFUR", "B000063JDE", "B00BMKGZVA", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00112S8RS", "B00177YA6U", "0767837398", "B000O76ZQC", "B0052ADP6Y", "B000J10F8C", "B000E6ESU8", "B00009OOFH", "B00005JLRE", "B0059GVBHG", "0767824954", "B00005JLWN", "B00E8G5GU6", "B000QXDCLA", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00004ZETA", "B00AEBB9CS", "B000021Y77", "B00011CZRE", "B002VECM4A", "B00003CXKS", "B006KH6CF4", "B000K7VHQE", "6305127654", "B00AFEXRME", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00020HB32"], "bought_together": ["B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JM23"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JMJG", "B000MEYKD2", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JPAR"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 222264}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.36, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXP1", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519CB9K0QML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Requiem for a Dream - Director's Cut"}

The \"True Patriots\" featurette is much better, examining the painstaking efforts toward authenticity in production design, artillery, and costuming. The visual effects featurette offers a study of several pivotal shots, displayed in triptych fashion (to show how effects are layered together from separate elements) and narrated by visual effects supervisor Stuart Robertson. Generous photo galleries are included, featuring shots of the primary cast, sets, and costumes (the last matched by a gallery of conceptual drawings), and the feature-length commentary by director Roland Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin is worthwhile, if not altogether essential.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFXKUI", "B00AMSLDTM", "B00AEBBA36", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00001ZWUS", "0800177967", "B000A2WP7O", "B00008G8M4", "B00003CXTG", "B004AOECXI", "B002O3Z510", "B000065U1N", "B00005221M", "B00000G3PA", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000E5N6LG", "B002O3Z50Q", "B0001HLVS2", "079284646X", "B00003CXA6", "B008MIMWOY", "6304711905", "0783225733", "B002VWNID6", "B0002WZTOI", "B000P0J0EW", "B00009OOFA", "B000NOKFHQ", "0783231202", "B000P0J0EM", "B003U0AHBO", "B004SIP7TE", "B00003CXQA", "B0000TANUI", "0792839137", "B00011CZRE", "B00005B6JZ", "B0002DRDBY", "B00AEFXRRO", "B002AS464Q", "B000WGWQG8", "B00026L9CU", "B00005JN5E", "B00007GZYC", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005ATZT", "B000067D1R", "B000U1ZV8K", "B00B0U2SFE", "B003AWRMCE", "6304806434", "B00AEBB932", "B00005JM6F", "B00005JL3T", "B002ZG997C", "B00AEFXVCU", "B000FI8MPW", "B000VKL6ZM", "B00319ECI8", "B005LAIGYQ", "B0045HCJT4", "B0008JIJ2O", "B002O3Z50G", "B00AZNEW5G", "B00008AOTO", "B000LP6KNU", "0783227973", "B002VWNIBI", "B004FQX5B6", "B00AEBB9WI", "B004IK30M8", "B004IK30MI", "B0007PALM0", "B00AEBBA0E", "B001TK80D4", "B000O77SRC", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000095WW8", "079283366X", "6305558167", "B00AEFXKOO", "B0007TKNM4", "B0002YLCG0", "B00003CXHJ", "B000MZHW40", "B000F48D4G", "B001BNFRB2", "B00AEFXYJA", "B000QXDED6", "0767817710", "B0004Z33EG", "B00005JN0W", "B003ASLJRC", "B00HEPE6MM", "0790729695", "B000FVQLRA", "B00004WG2F", "B008MIMWQW", "B000GG4Y32", "B0068FZ0O2"], "bought_together": ["B00001ZWUS", "B00AEBBA36"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFY5B6", "B004AOECXI", "B000NOKFHQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2823}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00004XPPG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NDFXHAW9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Patriot (Special Edition)"}

{"description": "If you've seenScreamandI Know What You Did Last Summer, then you know the entire plot ofScary Movie. That's okay, though, because this is a parody, and it helps to know the story in order to be able to get the jokes. No, the biggest surprise here is not the  story as much as the amount of full-frontal male nudity. Really, in addition to all the dick jokes (and the ass jokes and fart jokes), there's a couple of shots of the male member, one of which is erect and used as a weapon.Scary Moviesomehow ended up with an R rating, which in a sense is groundbreaking; perhaps our ratings board is loosening up after all.But is it funny? That's the most important question, and the answer to that is yes. In the vein ofAirplane!, with a dash of the Farrelly brothers,Scary Moviekeeps throwing jokes at you one after another. The law of averages says some of them have to hit, and enough of them do to keep the movie entertaining. Unlike the makers ofAirplane!, however, the Wayans brothers aren't making this movie out of a love of the genre, and unlike the Farrelly brothers, they don't make fun of retarded people with any sort of respect, so the humor throughout feels a lot uglier. Still, there are enough funny scenes inScary Movieto make the viewing experience worthwhile. Special credit must go to Lochlyn Munro as Greg, the over-the-top jock, who steals the movie up until the time he's gotta die.--Andy Spletzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SIP9I8", "B004SIP9KQ", "B000FOQ1KY", "B00CAATSME", "B0009P42WI", "B001J710YI", "B004SIP9O2", "B00AZMFINM", "B004SIP9MY", "B0016MJ6J2", "B004SIP9P6", "B000F9RLL2", "B004LWZW2O", "B005CFBYW6", "B004P7CMZ0", "6305017115", "B005DCJ218", "B0000VCZMK", "B00177YA06", "0780631684", "B000055WFZ", "B00008K7AM", "B002IT5GDC", "B000O76ZOO", "B0002VYOVI", "B00AEFXQLQ", "B000RIWAVW", "B001NPD9LS", "B000069CF0", "B004SIP8ES", "B00441GYVA", "630529142X", "B000FA57UI", "B000AM4P9K", "B009XTF8KQ", "B002A5EBMQ", "0767811070", "B00AEFYPXY", "B00005LC4Q", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B000K405CY", "B000IFRT4W", "B0021L8UXA", "B003Q6D27S", "B000FC2HS6", "B00081912E", "B00003CY5Y", "0783235070", "B00AEFYYH6", "B00H0EN98E", "B004EPZ084", "B000FA57US", "B001P3SA9Y", "B0031U8OEK", "B00003CXPS", "B003PIUINS", "B000VKL6Z2", "B001L9EXUC", "B000WZEZGI", "B003UESJBU", "B005DEUEXQ", "B00003CXS7", "B00009PY4G", "B00BEIYGT8", "B002GHHHG0", "B006W4KVH0", "B000GBEWHK", "B00AJLHUA8", "B002ZG971U", "B000WGYMTC", "B00J5JSV3A", "B00005K3NR", "B000J4QW7W", "B001J9KJ4I", "B00003CXZ1", "B004EPZ06G", "B000V4UFZK", "B0006SSOHC", "B00001QGUM", "B000022TSW", "B00AEFYE08", "0767824954", "B000031WD9", "B00004STUL", "B00005JNZU", "B004SEUJO6", "B008R65XTC", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B00AEFY37C", "B002ZG97TW", "B00005N7Z1", "B004P7CN7W", "B00003CY6D", "B00E8RKHWW", "B00BEIYMZ6", "B008G33PIM", "B000P0J09M", "B00006FDCD", "B00AEFYQWO"], "bought_together": ["B004SIP9I8", "B004SIP9KQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FOQ1KY", "B004SIP9KQ", "B004SIP9I8", "B008MXMFVE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 150447}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.99, "brand": "Dimension", "asin": "B00004Z4WQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5123WET5P4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Scary Movie"}

{"description": "Popular horror director Yoshisaki Kawajiri (Ninja Scroll) served as head writer on this 1995 feature. Komada and Koshigaya are scientists--and Bio Hunters, agents who battle the Demon Virus that causes humans to mutate into weird monsters. Komada has contracted the virus, but something in his immune system enables him to control his transformations. When Komada rescues Sayaka Murakami, the granddaughter of a famed psychic, from a gang of thugs, he unwittingly pits the Bio Hunters against the powerful politician Seijuro Tabe. The partners discover that Tabe is actually the horrible monster that's been roaming Tokyo, killing young women and eating their livers. He's no longer human, but a corpse possessed by the devil. The final battle pits Komada in his monster form against the tentacles and fanged jaws of the possessed Tabe, although Koshigaya administers the coup de gr&acirc;ce. A well-directed, violent entertainment,Bio Huntersuffers from a disjointed story: the link between Tabe's possession and the Demon Virus is never established. The ending suggests that the film may have been intended as a pilot, as Koshigaya declares the Bio Hunters' dedication to the ongoing battle against the Virus.Bio Hunteris not for viewers with weak stomachs. Not rated; suitable only for ages 18 and up for nudity, sex, violence, cannibalism, grotesque imagery, and violence against women.--Charles Solomon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004YZGB", "B00005V1XW", "B00005BCKE", "B005CVFZ16", "B0007939U2", "B000056MMA", "B000031EG6", "B0000APVFZ", "6304493681", "B009AVC922", "B00AIZ2LR2", "B00H9GIAQY", "B00005V4XG", "6305167257", "B00E00G9AQ", "1586640038", "B00000JL4L", "B001808CWE", "B00000JL42", "B000E5LF0K", "B00000JL4M", "6305262314", "B0007CNXYQ", "B00ENNBZ68", "B008YRL6WM", "B000OYCMNU", "B00006BSGS", "B004FHCHA0", "B00005KB6H", "B000UFAUUU", "B000FILUL0", "B0000B1OC6", "B00843TZEC", "B00HFC547A", "B00GRZPQR4", "B000NNUWYI", "B00005NG6U", "B00000IBUG", "B00014X8KO", "B00GS1GWRU", "B00000F0VU", "B00HFC30A8", "B00393UF6O", "B001AYWYEA", "B008NNY9YE", "B001N2WJ44", "B001CZJP0S", "B000Q66PX4", "B0009P42S2", "B00EV5I8JA", "B009AVCAJ4", "B003UNG8H8", "B000TZN7KQ", "B00BQ1DDUG", "B005WMQ5R8", "B0000WN0MS", "B007S9XXFA", "B0002J4X3Y", "B004SGWYVA", "B00E688U9K", "B00DNQM7M2", "B002CWKTQ4", "B008YRL7JE", "B004TP55PM", "B00005UW7E", "B00A92MDMM", "B001SGEUC4", "B004RIACSQ", "B00F9F4DX6", "B003UNASK6", "B00005QBZ9", "B00004Z4WG", "B001VFM5YW", "0767836316", "B009T3AHPC", "B009RZ890M", "B005SH647S", "B008HHTEUU", "B00000EZX5", "B00007M5JH", "B00CJ7XZFO", "B00DOZNGTK", "1573306886", "B00003UCAV", "B000087F31", "B007ILZAA4", "B00D44IQQE", "B004JPJHMY", "B000XSKDJW", "B005VAB7AQ", "B00B40N2UK", "B000063K2F", "B00441GYS8", "B0083QJVJO", "B00008K777", "B0001WTWMY", "B00012FWZ0", "B00B1RB8AC", "B0007R4TFI", "B002KX9CPO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009AVC922", "B005CVFZ16", "B00ENNBZ68", "B0007939U2"]}, "price": 10.72, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 170416}, "asin": "B0000541S4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514V9RPTK5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "BioHunter (Special Edition)"}

{"description": "When Sarah (Neve Campbell) strikes up a conversation with a sad-eyed man called Alex (William H. Macy) at her therapist's office, she asks, \"Are you one of those middle-aged guys who's tired of his marriage and thinking maybe a beautiful young thing could help him out?\" She's right, but the source of Alex's depression is far from typical: he's a second-generation hit man who wants out, but his mom and dad won't let him quit.Donald Sutherland makes Alex's laconic and utterly monstrous father the most frightening parent since John Huston inChinatown. A series of flashbacks show how he introduced Alex to his trade, beginning with shooting squirrels in the woods. We never find out whether Alex's father has mob connections, and the fact that it's just a business to him (\"This one's a big job, lots of moola, I'll buy your mother a Lexus\") makes him all the more chilling. Alex's mother (the steely Barbara Bain) knows all about the family business, but his wife (Tracey Ullman) thinks he runs a mail-order company, and the only person he confides in is a therapist (John Ritter). When he meets and falls for Sarah, Alex realizes that he alone can stand up to his father, and he needs to act before his own son becomes the next apprentice.Henry Bromell's debut film as a writer-director probes the same dark corners of the middle-aged male psyche asAmerican BeautyandThe Sopranos. Alex's tormented life is a symbol of the damage that parents can inflict on their children, and Bromell imbues his story with a tragic inevitability.Panicreceived a shamefully limited theatrical release, in spite of its rare combination of a great script and brilliant performances.

Will the King's supporters be able to restore their monarch's wits before he's stripped of his throne?   *1994: Director (Musical), Carousel  **1994: Art Direction", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004XYOQU4", "B000Z8H0IC", "B000RF7XYY", "B0000B1A58", "B001C4AFOY", "B0006Q93H4", "B00005JLJP", "B00015HXDG", "B0001KL5M6", "B001B1Q2UO", "B004XC5LQE", "B000RF7XYO", "B00007G1WH", "B00A4E8E78", "B000056HEA", "B001L57ZZG", "B000LPR6GA", "B000ZOXDFA", "B0012IV3Q4", "B004YCKJNI", "B004SIP9B0", "B000EHQUGC", "B00B2BYY1W", "B000NTM9ZW", "0767827775", "B004SIP98S", "B00003CXC9", "B000I2J6WI", "B003WEAW04", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B000GH3CQG", "B00005LOKU", "B0001V6ZK2", "B00BXTH44C", "B00ARX2VZW", "B00DQN6IOK", "B004M9ZI0M", "B001C46P2K", "B003UESJH4", "B002ZG99EK", "B000CSUNRU", "B000YPUFBA", "B00JJRLG7G", "B000FL7C9G", "B0001Z37IG", "B000EMGF2Q", "B000EOTELI", "B000V02CNW", "B00005OBAL", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B003WEAVZU", "0780618564", "B00166UFTS", "B001LPWGHS", "B00005O7N8", "B002U1LGSW", "0465027245", "B002TZS58I", "B000AYELAQ", "B006TTC5MM", "B000UJ48SQ", "B00005JKNF", "B003VE9WOC", "B007HW8U2Y", "B00GUO2SKA", "B003WEAVZK", "B00005V5NU", "B0001US7Q8", "630560097X", "B0045HCIZE", "B0059XTUVI", "B009Z59ZNE", "0792844041", "0307984702", "B009TT0BSE", "B00H9HZITU", "B00014NE62", "B004TPJN9Q", "B008RO875Q", "B0030BOCMS", "B00003CXPV", "B000ERVJQ8", "B00860YHSM", "B00GJT2OWS", "B004GXKBDI", "B0000AQS3P", "B00009IB1D", "B00004W5SS", "0571167497", "B000CSUNQQ", "B000M2E32M", "0783231202", "B003Q7B78S", "B003CP1T50", "B000LPS34E", "B00CZB9BE8", "B0010SAGGE", "B000NIVJFO", "B003AND1SM"], "bought_together": ["B004XYOQU4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004XYOQU4", "B00015HXDG", "B003UESJH4", "B004SIP98S"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 45607}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 55.99, "brand": "HAWTHORNE,NIGEL", "asin": "B00005AUJT", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FYFMPSRZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Madness of King George"}
{"description": "The British accents and lingo ofEssex Boysare so thick it may help to watch with subtitles--but the moviemaking is clear and crisp. Billy (Charlie Creed-Miles) is a cabdriver who starts getting chauffeuring gigs with some shady characters. But his life remains mild until he's sent to pick up Jason (Sean Bean fromRoninandLord of the Rings), a short-fused mobster who's just been released from five years in prison. Jason quickly decides to settle some old scores and drags Billy along for the ride. Soon Billy is part of a mob--and finds he likes the money and status that go with it, despite the misgivings of his girlfriend and of his former mentor, Mr. D (Tom Wilkinson). When Jason's volatile jealousy leads him to mistreat his wife Lisa (Alex Kingston fromER), things take a turn for the worse and Billy gets in deeper than he ever expected. In its rough plot outlines,Essex BoysresemblesGoodfellas--but the particular British flavor makes this a very different movie. Its gritty realism and attention to detail also separate it from the empty flash ofLock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels;Essex Boysearns its suspense with sharp writing, strong performances all around, and lean, tight direction. An excellent addition to the recent spate of gangster flicks.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001G6E7N8", "B003PAXOLE", "B0001BKACG", "B00124ONT2", "B00005R87B", "B004VK742M", "B0047VZS4G", "B000069HZZ", "B001BEK8A6", "B008H1Q3KU", "B00007KQKM", "B000ECXWW2", "B001DF67XU", "B0057FGD2C", "B00ET2ODTE", "B000QGDXGG", "B00F3TDA6O", "B00319EC9W", "B004P2VQZC", "B00HI9QG9K", "B00BTYXNPK", "B001HUHAQE", "B000GIXLWU", "B00EMAGKNU", "B00005V1WP", "6305263248", "B000QXDCLK", "B00HW3ELGW", "B00006IUJP", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B004KK3IIC", "B005OTGS4E", "B00J11U54K", "B00004TJJV", "B00J5LXT44", "B0000SXK0E", "B007MDB6UQ", "B00IKM5LXG", "B004VHOAGS", "B00009XN2V", "B00393SG56", "B000CQLZ8S", "B00C8CQ5SO", "B00HI9QDKM", "B00FRILRW0", "B008BWFP2W", "B00005LW55", "B000NO3DLG", "B000BC8SYW", "B004ALIG1U", "0767833600", "B001RXDM2M", "B004JMSIWM", "B00D3DJIG8", "B0008ENHTO", "B004UVYQYQ", "B000LV6OJE", "B0016QNSFG", "B000NJL4QC", "B00005JN8P", "B0057FGD0E", "0767802519", "B0030Y11T2", "B002FUIJ5Q", "B006M3M5FM", "B00C12ZISE", "0007232144", "0749921501", "B002BD9DG6", "1743382863", "B00006LPD1", "B005Y2HXDQ", "B00007AJDP", "B000055WAL", "B00079HZPC", "B0009KQOOM", "B000Z8H13Q", "1892649462", "B000Z7G8EA", "B000QUTS9S"], "bought_together": ["B001G6E7N8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001G6E7N8", "B0001BKACG", "B000BC8SYW", "B000FBNG1O"]}, "price": 19.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 177598}, "asin": "B00005B20H", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XLS3EJcUL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Essex Boys"}
{"description": "The premise ofLove Potion #9--that a magic potion makes the user irresistible to the opposite sex--could be the setup for the crassest sex farce imaginable. Instead, this film is a surprisingly subtle romantic comedy. Nebbishy scientist Paul (Tate Donovan) goes to a Gypsy fortuneteller (Anne Bancroft), who tells him she sees no women in his entire life. To make up for this depressing news, she gives him a few drops of a love potion--number 8. Paul, a biochemist, scoffs; but when his pet cat accidentally gets a taste and attracts every female cat in the neighborhood, he enlists fellow dweeby scientist Diane (Sandra Bullock) to analyze it. After experimenting on monkeys, they decide to test it on themselves; soon Diane is being pursued by handsome Italians in the street and comes close to marrying the Prince of England, while Paul gets a little revenge on a woman who previously rejected him, then embarks on his own love spree. Shortly they discover that they really want each other; but before they can get married, an old boyfriend of Diane returns with his own dose of love potion number 8. Paul's only hope is to get something even more powerful.Love Potion #9is genuinely clever and sweet, and both Donovan and Bullock work well with the low-key but effective humor of the movie's well-written script. It's a tribute to her talent and her girl-next-door looks that Bullock, unlike most pretty stars dressing down, is effective as both a lovelorn loser and the confident glamour-girl she becomes. Altogether, a charming and enjoyable film.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783235380", "6305736685", "B000CEV3M8", "B00465I16K", "B00068GTK6", "B00000JGHN", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B002SYAGNC", "6305874867", "6304765266", "B002NZK5V4", "B00006ZXSQ", "B0000640RY", "B00008G6E8", "B00004UEDQ", "B003PIUIJC", "B00008NRI7", "B0002IQLHQ", "B005FH1RRI", "B002K0WBXW", "B000M341SC", "B0077ATSSQ", "B0006GANOQ", "B000QGDY0G", "B002NZK5VO", "B000CCBCHG", "B000HEWEE4", "B00FQRZ6EM", "B002NZK5RS", "0783225482", "B0045HCJGC", "B000NA1WE0", "B000GB5M3S", "B000058TLQ", "B00E8RKHWW", "B0032XNKY0", "B00006ZXSL", "B0001GF24M", "6305236569", "B00HLSW6II", "B000HLDFK4", "B0047685GO", "B00008G7UF", "B000A3XY5A", "B00DMDE02Q", "B001M5M6XG", "B002ZG989G", "B0002B15X8", "B0007PLLBU", "B006GL8MQQ", "6305213283", "B0000A2ZO0", "6305133468", "B00015YVD6", "B002SYAGN2", "B0045HCJRG", "6305428395", "B0002I84N0", "B002NZK5UU", "B00AEBB8NS", "B000EXDRLW", "B002XUBDRY", "078322740X", "B00006ZXSO", "B0012RWQJ8", "B00AEFXYOA", "B00AEBB9WI", "B000ICLRHK", "B000N60H9U", "B004LWZW9C", "B00AEBB8YW", "B0000AYGBF", "B002P413IC", "B002ZG9968", "B000067J1O", "B0009KA2OA", "B00GSTHC7G", "B00008G7UM", "B0077ATSZE", "B004SIP9RO", "B005HWAOP2", "B0021L8UZS", "B00000JMOD", "B00H83EUQW", "B009INAK8C", "B000065V3E", "B004XQO8VO", "B0000714BW", "B0009OL7Z4", "B002AS464Q", "B001AEF6C2", "B0001IN0S0", "B002VECM6S", "B00005R5GA", "B00008G7UI", "B000KJU13C", "B0007IO6NM", "B00013WWT8", "0792844866", "B000QGDYZQ"], "bought_together": ["B000CEV3M8", "6304765266"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000G6BLJW", "6304765266", "B000CEV3M8", "B002SYAGNC"]}, "price": 29.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 141339}, "asin": "B00005B209", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J69QEGSSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Love Potion #9"}

Winner Cate Blanchett leads an incredible all-star cast including Academy Award-winner Hilary Swank (Boys Don't Cry), Keanu Reeves (The Matrix), Katie Holmes (Wonder Boys), Giovanni Ribisi (Saving Private Ryan), and Oscar-nominee Greg Kinnear (As Good As It Gets) in this stylishly filmed mystery that's as eerie as a backwoods swamp with a dark secret beneath it's even darker surface. Widow and mother of three, Annie Wilson (Blanchett), makes her living by foretelling others' futures...though her own has become cloudier than even she can see. Threatened by a client's violently jealous husband (Reeves) and plagued by visions of a missing towns-girl (Holmes), Annie is unwittingly pulled into a thicket of lies and deception in which her extraordinary gift could be used against her...and get her killed. Written by Billy Bob Thornton (Sling Blade) and Tom Epperson (A Family Thing), and directed by Sam Raimi (A Simple Plan), The Gift is a gripping tale of supernatural intrigue...and chilling terror.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000E6ESU8", "B00005JKN2", "6305127654", "B000NIVJFY", "B001OXLGJQ", "B00005JKTF", "B001URA5Y8", "B000189LE2", "B001RTKKS0", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00066FB3O", "B0002J4X2K", "B000JBXXYK", "B000BBOUUE", "B0002DB54A", "B0000640VK", "B000AM6OVW", "B00008972P", "B00006SFJJ", "B001DJ7PSC", "B005XB8T68", "B00005V4XW", "B000MTFFO0", "B0000541W8", "B00275EGNS", "B002YMWQ9U", "B001URA5YI", "B00004ZETA", "B004SUDQC2", "B000NO39FG", "B002O3Z4WK", "B00005JMIJ", "B0000ZMGWK", "B00112S8RS", "B002NZK5RI", "B000RF7XYO", "B000HT38EO", "B00005JNY3", "B0073U2EWM", "B00003CXND", "B001Q8MMBK", "B00BTYHC16", "B00GS08Y3Q", "0790776960", "B00BTYJYOY", "B0009X76ZK", "B0037QGS0A", "B00E8G5HXM", "B0045HCIYA", "B00G7QPXUI", "B001P3SA9O", "B00007AJE1", "B00FEHCQEC", "B0000AZT79", "B00BLSD5MK", "B00008G7UL", "B00005Y1UV", "B00102F5WK", "B00000J11D", "6305065551", "B0034G4OXQ", "B00006AUJR", "B000FIHN5M", "B00005YU1M", "B0002KPIQY", "B00026ZD04", "B001PPLJIQ", "B00AEBBA4K", "0792840127", "B0006IIKQW", "B00023P4I8", "B00005JKJA", "B00005NG06", "B004XYABMQ", "B008NA3I30", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00003CY0V", "B004ZJZQAQ", "B00K0MM4AM", "B00E8G5H8W", "B000ETRCN0", "B001AZKB8K", "B006M3M5FM", "0780627849", "B00AEFXJ86", "B0007CEXYK", "B0001GF2D8", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B0001932ZU", "B004SIP71M", "B00AEFXT1S", "B006KH6CF4", "B00AEFXGIY", "B00005YUO2", "B0013F2ESM", "B002GIBVWA", "B00GRZPRB4", "B00080ZG10", "B000OY8NBK"], "bought_together": ["B000E6ESU8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000QUU7KC", "B000NO39FG", "B001RTKKS0", "B001OXLGJQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 27495}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.68, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B00005JH9M", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BFJ7NZT7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Gift"}

{"description": "Heavy on atmosphere and light on everything else,From Hellis visually impressive while lacking the depth of the acclaimed graphic novel it's based upon. Making their third feature since 1993'sMenace II Society, twins Allen and Albert Hughes approach the Jack the Ripper case with physical precision, re-creating the gritty Whitechapel district of 1888 London in meticulous detail. What they've forgotten is the sheer terror that gripped Whitechapel in the wake of the Ripper's slaying of five prostitutes, investigated here by a Scotland Yard sleuth (Johnny Depp) who uses opium, laudanum, and absinthe to fuel his semiprescient visions of the slayings. Heather Graham attempts a slippery Cockney accent as a would-be victim, while Ian Holm steals the show as a has-been surgeon with devilish delusions of grandeur. Violence is obliquely suggested or briefly graphic, but no matter how you cut it,From Hellis only marginally thrilling as it treads familiar territory.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBBA72", "B000NQRR1Q", "B004P7CNC2", "B00005R87R", "B000F7CECK", "B00AEBBAEK", "B00000IRE6", "B002QEHPQU", "B0002234LS", "B008QE9XD2", "B0000VD04M", "B0009UZG0K", "0780621611", "B006ISJQ1W", "B004SIP7PS", "B0000AC8LI", "B00347AIOE", "B00003CXWV", "B003HKN52U", "B001HN69AY", "B000053VAZ", "B000TGJ80S", "B0012Q7M02", "B00AEBB9F0", "B002Q3MYA8", "B00C888MJ8", "B00004XPPB", "B000FDEV3Y", "0780628551", "0783229526", "B001HN694K", "B0000WN140", "B0009IOR6Q", "B00F84H73Q", "B00003CXRG", "B001GCUO0W", "B004A8ZWSS", "B004SIP6BI", "B00004W4UB", "B000N2HDJQ", "B000C3L27U", "B000GCFO0I", "B000BB1MI2", "B005S9EJ8W", "B0009XRZKQ", "B00AEBB89W", "B008R65Y28", "B001I04QCO", "B00008LUNW", "B00005JLKN", "B003Y5H54W", "B0012QE4Q2", "B00DZP1C2W", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00JPFTX5O", "B0000TPA0G", "B001AGXEAG", "B0041KKYEM", "B00J5JSV3A", "B000069I1I", "B002UOMH00", "B004SIP92O", "B001A50716", "B005LAIHYU", "B0002KVUKM", "B005COPWZW", "B0036BDQ7Y", "B000UJ48P4", "B004SIP7TE", "B0031U8OEK", "0783116934", "B005LAIHXQ", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B000063US5", "B00005JLQN", "B00DHD933W", "B002AF4Y9G", "B000LP6KNU", "B008JFUNYG", "B0021L8V34", "B001D2WU9I", "B007XF0W3K", "B003AWRMBU", "B00009MEKN", "B00HRCATDW", "B0020PFYHC", "B00003CXKM", "B004SUDQ4A", "B0010DR4BO", "B0097C046W", "B00IKM5LXG", "B000FAOC2W", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00K6D1RVW", "B002ZG97CO", "B00151QYXU", "B005LAIH2C", "6301971345", "6304712499", "B003H5WF3U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBBA72", "B004P7CNC2", "B00005R87R", "B000NQRR1Q"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 164982}, "asin": "B00005JKJM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/418JG1F78JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "From Hell (Two-Disc Special Edition)"}
{"description": "The classic science fiction novel by H.G. Wells becomes this big-budget adventure directed by the author's great-grandson Simon Wells. Guy Pearce stars as Alexander Hartdegen, a scientist, professor, and inventor in 1895 New York City who believes that time travel is possible. The sudden and unexpected death of his fianc&#x82;e spurs Alexander to build a time machine, which he hopes to use in an effort to change the past. When he is unable to change the past, Alexander hurls himself more than 800,000 years into the future, seeking answers about the nature of time, but instead encountering a dystopian world where humanity has divided up into two races, the peaceful Eloi and the subterranean Morlocks. Befriending the beautiful Eloi woman Mara (pop singer Samantha Mumba), Alexander must set out to save her from the underground world of the Morlocks when she is captured by them. Along the way, he is aided by Vox (Orlando Jones), a bio-mechanical being from the 21st century. Ultimately, Alexander makes a shocking discovery about the true nature of the Eloi and Morlocks and decides that the only way to change the future is to alter the present. Due to exhaustion, director Wells was briefly replaced during the last few weeks of production by Gore Verbinski, director of The Mexican (2001). The Time Machine co-stars Jeremy Irons and Mark Addy.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0045HCJSA", "B001BGS17Q", "B000CZ0PNK", "B00LNBQ8SI", "B00LMCDHMS", "B00LNBQ8UG", "B00ANDFL3A", "B00IYJFB2G", "0780619951", "B0000639BZ", "B00003CXXP", "B00003CWU3", "630587493X", "B00K2CHVSK", "B00007JMD8", "B00005JNTI", "B00L4K3MLE", "B00005JKU0", "B00AEBB8VK", "B000FVQLKW", "B00K2CHWYI", "B00LCAD24S", "B00005JKFR", "B001SGEUYW", "0780622650", "B005FQ2H8W", "B0019ESNGY", "B002945DU2", "B00AEBB8QK", "B00020HAWE", "B00000G3PA", "B00009NHC0", "0790750201", "B000HEWEDK", "B001P9N94E", "B00IKM5N1G", "B00008G8M5", "B00005JL78", "B000O78KWE", "B0000844I8", "B0050MB5KM", "B00007G1YQ", "B008JFUO36", "B00D9EJFZA", "B0000AUHOH", "B00133KHBK", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B00IKM5LXG", "B000096IAC", "B00003CXKM", "B0016I0AJG", "B00008G8M4", "B000YDOOHI", "B00K7IPGS6", "B003NH3X5Q", "B008JFUNHI", "B00005N5S5", "0767812166", "B001EAWMGA", "B0045HCJ0S", "B002NZK5SM", "B00ECW9UJY", "B004B93RDS", "B001AR0D4A", "B00HWWUQYY", "B0009X75J2", "B000K7VHQ4", "B00004W46I", "B00009ATIX", "B000SFJ4K4", "B000HC2LZS", "B000KGGIV4", "B003BJO8KU", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00008438U", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B001BSBBNK", "6305090564", "B000BUNZY2", "B006VRRGNK", "079073639X", "B0074JOUHE", "B00AEBBA72", "B00J5LXMTG", "B000C20VNM", "B001A4VH3Y", "B00JL6L4UY", "B000063UR0", "B00079HZS4", "B00AEFXT7W", "B002BFBB4Q", "0783226063", "B000MX7V70", "0783231032", "B00005Y6XR", "B00BTYPW7C", "B00006JDRG", "0783240961", "1558908846", "B0013LL2Z2"], "bought_together": ["B0045HCJSA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0045HCJSA", "B001BGS17Q", "B00AIBZMD6", "B0090SI56Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14168}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.26, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JKLZ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RZF2PBJAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Time Machine"}

{"description": "Delicate and hypnotic,The Hoursinterweaves three stories with remarkable skill: in the 1920s Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) grapples  with her inner demons and slowly works on her novelMrs. Dalloway;  in 1949 housewife Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) feels her own destructive impulses; and in 1999 book editor Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl  Streep)--much like the title character of Woolf's novel--prepares to throw a party, in honor of her dearest friend, a seriously ill  poet (Ed Harris). Small details reverberate from story to story  as a powerhouse cast (including Allison Janney, Toni Collette, Claire  Danes, Jeff Daniels, John C. Reilly, Stephen Dillane, and Miranda Richardson) gives subtle  and beautifully modulated performances.

{"description": "Such a simple idea--yet so fiendishly complex in the execution.24, as surely everyone knows by now, is a thriller that takes places over 24 hours, midnight to midnight, in 24 one-hour episodes (well, 45-minute episodes if you subtract the commercials). Everything takes place in real time, which means no flashbacks, no flash-forwards, no handy time-dissolves. Every strand of the plot has to be dovetailed and interlocked so things happen just when they should, in the right amount of time. Not that easy.Creator Robert Cochran and his team of writers and directors have done an impressive job of putting the jigsaw together and keeping the tension ratcheted up high, as federal agent Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) runs around L.A. trying to stall an assassination attempt on an African American presidential candidate and rescue his wife and daughter from the clutches of the Balkan baddies. Twists, turns, revelations, and cliffhangers are tossed at us with satisfying regularity. It's not perfect: we get some hokey plot devices (instant amnesia, anybody?); the final twist makes no sense whatsoever; there are altogether too many huggy family moments; and as for Dennis Hopper's \"Serbian\" accent....Even so, this is undeniably mold-breaking TV. Sutherland, rescuing his career from the doldrums in one heroic leap, fully deserves his Golden Globe. Sets and locations are artfully deployed, and Sean Callery's score is a powerful, brooding presence. LikeMurder OneandThe Sopranos,24is one of those series that future TV thrillers will be measured against.--Philip Kemp", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008YGRU", "B0002XVQSU", "B000B837XI", "B000ICLRKC", "B000MR8W92", "B001L5SRJE", "B002ZCY7SW", "B000NDEXKW", "B001DMVZOE", "B002ZCY7TG", "B0015QWZ8S", "B0001WHXM0", "B001QE99AQ", "B009LDD1H6", "B000VWC9YW", "B001DJLCRC", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B0075FF5QM", "B000RO6JY0", "B001934SNM", "B0015RRNMA", "B00005JOC9", "B000R9YLKY", "B003145HQY", "B00005JNOG", "B00J5LXT44", "B00KPP6R9S", "B0053O8AKU", "B000Q6GUW0", "B000YABIQ6", "B0044E9JU0", "B00HW3EXCE", "B009MF5BXK", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00BW4S8AC", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B00JL6L4UY", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B00HX0KIAM", "B008CLI4N4", "B000W91RUG", "0553397737", "B00KDK64DY", "B00AIBZMM2"], "bought_together": ["B00008YGRU", "B0002XVQSU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0044E9JU0", "B00008YGRU", "B0002XVQSU", "B00LDCGBNE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18292}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.38, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B00005JLF2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41PB6M8MGRL._SX300_.jpg", "title": "24: Season 1"}

{"description": "More sex. More violence. That's what you get in the unrated director's cut ofTaking Lives, which ought to tell you where director D.J. Caruso's priorities lie. The hot scenes between Angelina Jolie and Ethan Hawke are extended (offering a bit more nudity for Jolie's lecherous fans), and the fate of Gena Rowlands's character isconsiderablymore graphic, but none of the added footage makes the movie any better or worse. That said, this cynical director's cut is the only version worth buying if you're looking to fill out your serial-killer-thriller collection (or your movies-in-which-Jolie-gets-naked collection), and you might as well enjoy the gag reel outtakes because they contain the only footage on the entire DVD in which Jolie cracks a genuine smile. The four featurettes are really just one standard-issue promo reel chopped into thematic categories with a pretentiousCSIvibe, and while they offer little of substance, seasoned film buffs will welcome the appearance of veteran British editor Anne V. Coates, who briefly explains her approach to cutting high-tension scenes. The rest is routine at best, but given the choice between the full-screen DVD and this steamier, more gruesome widescreen version, well, it's no contest. Jolie and her breasts await you.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783240295", "B00005V4XV", "B0002KPIQY", "B00006G8JD", "B001GKJ2E8", "B0021L8V0M", "B000G2YCVA", "B001NFNFNU", "B000VBB6F6", "B00BTYU3W6", "B00029RT9E", "B00003CXZ1", "B002NZK5RI", "B004A8ZWSS", "B0050UEVNM", "B00003CWQR", "B000AP04FG", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B00AEFYGBA", "6305821216", "B000MXPE7O", "B00AEFYF2K", "B00011CZRE", "B0000ZG072", "B00096S49Y", "B00007AJE1", "B000PMFS2I", "0792159659", "B001HVZOB6", "B00004Z4WR", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00AEFXEGS", "B000MX7V70", "B000GRUMSC", "B00008L3S6", "B00151QYXU", "B0045HCIYA", "B000FS9UKI", "B006OB3JVQ", "B00005JN0T", "B0010YVCB6", "B00005JLZN", "6305308837", "B00003CY0V", "B00AEBBA2W", "B0034G4OSG", "B002NZK5VO", "B000E5N684", "B00015YVDG", "B0001GF2D8", "B0000541TM", "B0006IIPIK", "0790730979", "B00K2CHX9C", "B002QW7AMG", "B00AP2DC94", "B00023P4I8", "B001CC7PLM", "0767810872", "B00E8G5HXM", "B003LR5BD0", "B0062P3392", "B00BB67UNW", "B00BNH9NCU", "B0007W7I4W", "B0010HOZW6", "B003L20IG0", "0783229402", "B004XQO90O", "B00006RCNY", "B00006HAWN", "B00024JC30", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B0000V492Y", "B00174RCHW", "B0040J1RX6", "B0002IQLHQ", "B002AT8KAG", "B00005JN2Z", "B001N44BVQ", "B0047T74CM", "B00BEIYIF0", "B004A8ZX28", "B000U1ZV76", "B000G5SILC", "B000R4SMCW", "0767807588", "B00009WVSL", "B002DU39GW", "6301971345", "B004SIP7VM", "B000BVM1S2", "0767802519", "B00887490Y", "B004VJJG92", "B0067EKYAY", "B000BYY11Y", "B001JNNDJM", "B00005JKQS"], "bought_together": ["0783240295"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0021L8V0M", "B001GKJ2E8", "B000AP04FG", "B001NFNFNU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 54618}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.95, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JMWP", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513DTkJ5nnL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Taking Lives - Director's Cut (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "One hopes that at the annual HBO characters Christmas party, Larry Sanders, Carrie Bradshaw, and Tony Soprano make a point to raise a toast to Martin Tupper, the hapless hero ofDream On.  This groundbreaking 1990 sitcom from futureFriendscreators David Crane and Marta Kaufman ushered in a bold new era of original cable programming not bound by broadcast network content restrictions. Hence, the profanity and nudity (you didn't seethatonKnott's Landing!), which distinguished the series and helped put HBO on the pop culture map. Brian Benben stars as Martin, a New York book editor still reeling from the breakup of his marriage. The show's gimmick is that baby boomer Martin, a member of the first television generation, flashes on vintage TV clips that express his innermost feelings and desires. When his wife, Judith (Wendie Malick), visits Martin in \"The First Episode,\" he fantasizes reconciliation, but she wants him to sign the divorce papers so she can remarry. The scene is punctuated by clips (from an oldTwilight Zoneepisode, perhaps?) in which boxer Lee Marvin is pummeled in the ring and knocked out. But the clips and the language and the sex would get old fast if we didn't like the characters. Benben has the Everyman charm of a young George Segal, and he wears his anxiety to hilarious effect. He is devoted to his young teenage son, and still loves Judith, who is marrying a paragon, never seen, but described at one point as a \"Ghandi for our times.\" His dating relationships spectacularly crash and burn (cue clip of disabled aircraft). In one episode, he comes undone when he discovers his new lover was a porn star. At the office, he is at the mercy of his caustic secretary (Denny Dillon).Dream Onis of more than prurient interest. This was one of those lightning-in-a-bottle series blessed with a fresh vision, a seamless ensemble, and smart writing. To finally have it on DVD is a Dream come true.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008WJBD", "B0009WIE3Y", "B000BFJM5S", "B003NHMYJW", "B000VTHYAE", "B00JPSYPCM", "B0007XBMA2", "6305428263", "B00IU6HPIQ", "B000FL7CB4", "B0000696I7", "1936220849", "1936220830", "B00ET2ODU8", "B0008KLVA0", "B00CPTUO1Y", "B007K7IAGM", "B000B5IP4W", "B00CYQXCDK", "B000ANVPMO", "B009R5H6UQ", "B0007W6HVM", "B004YMATCY", "B008JFUNNM", "1936220822", "B009LDCVJU", "B00HI4EGQA", "B00FUABHVQ", "B000DZ8540", "B000FS9MY2", "B00A2XQTF0", "B00317LMAG", "B00049QJBG", "B00817MQBK", "B000MTFDB0", "B00HMOW9YM", "B0002CX1M0", "B00DOZNGTK", "B001AR0D5Y", "B0063DOV2Q", "B00E8G5H8W", "B0030VANIU", "B000QFCDAO", "B0051WTODQ", "B000N3T0EQ", "B009CI8S6Y", "B00000IREA", "B006M3M5FM", "B000ERVK5S", "B00005JN8Q", "B003H9M1QM", "B0050UEVJ6", "B00004TJJV", "B001FFBI9G", "B00369ERC4", "B00BUYWJEA", "193622089X", "B0090XPH06", "B00H9KKKAY", "B00DY9528Y", "B000UJ48SQ", "B003INBNV6", "B00E96AY20", "B0041KKZKA", "076782170X", "B00198PJNA", "B001CQONOA", "B00C7A8WZQ", "B003UD7J26", "B0001US78G", "B0009HLD4Q"], "bought_together": ["B00008WJBD", "B000BFJM5S"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BFJM5S", "B00008WJBD", "B0009WIE3Y", "B003NHMYJW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 51718}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 42.7, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005JN8P", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WW4Z3KS0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dream On - Seasons 1 &amp; 2"}

{"description": "The supplemental features ofFahrenheit 9/11offer almost an hour and a half of further manna for Michael Moore's supporters and ammunition for his critics, including appearances by two of the most memorable figures in the film, Michigan mother Lila Lipscomb and Marine corporal Abdul Henderson.  \"The Release ofFahrenheit 9/11\" (11 minutes) collects reactions to the film from celebrities, political leaders, and Quentin Tarantino and Tilda Swinton of the 2004 Cannes Film Festival jury (but no film critics).  Lipscomb gives a moving speech at the film's Washington, D.C. premiere (4 minutes), and in an 18-minute sequence, an embedded Swedish journalist recounts his experiences, accompanied by footage of U.S. soldiers raiding an Iraqi home.  This provides the context for the scene in the main film in which a soldier gets his picture taken with a bound and hooded Iraqi, which is chillingly similar to the infamous pictures from Abu Ghraib prison.  The second part of the DVD features consists of seven new or extended scenes (about 50 minutes total), including more footage of Iraq before the invasion; protesters outside Abu Ghraib and former prisoners showing their injuries; more thoughts from Cpl. Abdul Henderson; National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice trying to squirm off the hook in front of the 9/11 Commission; and President Bush going through the motions of a press appearance after he appeared before the same commission.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000UNYJXQ", "B0030Y11XS", "B00008DDVV", "B00009YXAS", "B00008K76O", "B0030Y11O2", "B0002RQ2Q2", "B001G43C1S", "B00008L3TE", "B0041KKYBA", "B00068VAOG", "B000T28C5Y", "B000ICL3KG", "B000BTH4K4", "B002FOQY7M", "B0002OXVBO", "B001NMT8R0", "B001MFNB5I", "B001MVWFAO", "0743272927", "B000FBH3W2", "B0007DBJM8", "B000UYX4N6", "B0027BOL4G", "B000U6YJMO", "B00G0PXU2Y", "B00005JPXA", "B000GYHRHO", "B002EP8TQG", "B000C3L2IO", "B000JVSUSE", "B004EPYZDA", "B0016N52IK", "B001BEK8FQ", "B0041KKYBK", "B00KY6YAO2", "B00F12IRSO", "B00DYC648S", "B001F5274G", "B0001L3LUE", "B000HWXOT0", "B005FITIGO", "B003CJXJ8Q", "B0013D8LHM", "B00DPUB5LK", "044653224X", "B005KBJC0I", "B004FQX59I", "B00KUS5YGC", "B007KAUWO2", "B00GYG8BKK", "B000093NQZ", "B001P9G3HE", "B00483VQTE", "B003Q6D28C", "B001B7CNW4", "B000BBOUHM", "B00744WZ8U", "B00066VTBW", "B001KWB0L0", "B00443YDWK", "B000059TG8", "B000JLTRIQ", "B003JUINFM", "0060392452", "B000I5Y8FU", "B000BITURA", "B003XKNGLY", "B004EPYZDK", "B003M987AG", "B000PY52IG", "B006ML50QK", "B000QGE89W", "B00EK52XQK", "B00DENQEE6", "B000GH3CR0", "B0047UJBP4", "B00005J75F", "0446693790", "B0006N2DSI", "B001AEF6HM", "B00005JLYW", "B001J66JQI", "B000O0YV7O", "B002NPCJRC", "B00AZMFG48", "B0042KZJIC", "B00827OX5Q", "B0002HDXTQ", "B001E5FYS8", "B00AEBB89C", "B003H23KSM", "B000CEXEWA", "0615602223", "B006JN86VW", "B00914YLAG", "B0001IXT36", "B008PUI1GM", "B004SIP7ZS"], "bought_together": ["B000UNYJXQ", "B0030Y11XS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000UNYJXQ", "B0030Y11XS", "B00008DDVV", "B0002OXVBO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 44430}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.0, "brand": "From HIBISCUS EXPRESS, http://www.amazon.com/shops/AXD9LOVGJXES3", "asin": "B00005JNEI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KDRVF1JGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fahrenheit 9/11"}

{"description": "Barry Levinson directed this comedy in which success has a rather surprising effect on two old buddies. Nick Vanderpark (Jack Black) and Tim Dingman (Ben Stiller) are best friends and next-door neighbors who work together at a sandpaper factory. Nick and Tim often find themselves wishing for something more from life, and Nick has a habit of dreaming up harebrained get-rich-quick schemes that usually end in disaster. Tim is particularly appalled by Nick's latest idea, \"Vapoorizer,\" a cleaning product which will make pet feces magically disappear, but to their shock, it turns out to be an incredible success, and before long Nick is wealthy beyond his wildest dreams. Tim, however, is still the same guy getting by in suburbia he's always been, and soon Tim finds himself bitterly resentful of his old friend. As Nick gets richer, Tim gets angrier, and he develops a drinking problem. One night, in a bar, Tim meets an eccentric drifter (Christopher Walken) who offers him some not-so-friendly advice on getting even with his old friend. Envy also stars Rachel Weisz and Amy Poehler as Tim and Nick's much-put-upon spouses.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004P7CNZ4", "B0017RFY56", "B000A3XYIM", "B00AEFYSL8", "B000089778", "0783235070", "B00005KA6V", "B000MCH5RM", "B00005JMW7", "B00024JC4E", "B00AEBB9K0", "B00AEFYPXY", "B005LAII2Q", "B0045HCJRG", "B002NO4ISG", "B00AEFXPG2", "B00HOGBXTU", "B000ICM5X0", "0790742071", "B0000WN1OU", "B000085EFK", "B002ZG99H2", "B00003CXS7", "B00005JLSB", "B000HT386M", "B00AEBB9E6", "B00BTYNXJG", "B00024JC30", "0792842162", "B00007JMDW", "B00AEBBA2M", "B00AEFXP8K", "B0006GANPA", "B00003CXE4", "B00013RC7K", "B00016MSV2", "B00005JM4Q", "B000TGJ82G", "B00004RJ73", "B00006G8JD", "B000274T94", "B00121QGV8", "B001AR0CUK", "079073639X", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B003TY2SPO", "B00005JLQN", "B001L9EXTS", "B001L5800A", "B000RW3VCK", "B004LWZW7E", "B002KLAL88", "B00BLN4UHY", "B00003CXPS", "B0000AKCKI", "B00005JKJJ", "B007UW9WMS", "B00441GZ2S", "B004SIP6WW", "B000OYC7BW", "B002BIULL2", "0800141687", "B00AEFYZCU", "B00005JPQE", "B000K7VHOG", "B000035Z38", "B00AEBBA2C", "B000LC3ICE", "B00008G8LM", "B000FO0AA6", "B001DPHDB0", "B000069HYG", "B00AKGG828", "B000G1R39E", "B00005JMUA", "B003B3V0UM", "B00003CXTM", "B0009PVZ9Q", "B00007AJF8", "B00BLN4UPG", "B000EMGJAO", "B0030Y11XS", "B0002VEUV2", "B00005JNBQ", "0767817710", "B00AEFXKZ8", "B004UXUWEC", "B007UW9W8W", "B007FO5PYK", "B00DL46ZN8", "B002T51X4Q", "B00005JMEW", "B000E8N8H0", "B000K7VHTQ", "B0009PVZD2", "B000TJ6PBK", "B0006TPE4C", "B00003CWTI", "B000RETOGU", "B007C8RZR4"], "bought_together": ["B0000YTOKI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AMSNED0", "B000H30B2C", "B000MCH5RM", "B000A3XYIM"]}, "price": 3.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 47859}, "asin": "B00005JM9Z", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AR4B8M2VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Envy (Widescreen Edition)"}

When a leading roboticist dies suspiciously, Spooner pursues a trail that may prove his suspicions.

{"description": "An excellent interview with director Sydney Pollack illustrates his intelligent approach of making films. However, the fact the alternate ending was even shot is bewildering. Thank goodness it didn't make the final cut! Pollack makes a passionate plea for keeping the widescreen aspect for home video. Although he enjoys the squarer, full-screen picture, he tells us that panning-and-scanning a widescreen print is disregarding how he shot the film.

{"description": "Movies don't come any bigger than Peter Jackson'sKing Kong, a three-hour remake of the 1933 classic that marries breathtaking visual prowess with a surprising emotional depth. Expanding on the original story of the blonde beauty and the beast who falls for her, Jackson creates a movie spectacle that matches hisLord of the Ringsfilms and even at times evokes their fantasy world while celebrating the glory of '30s Hollywood. Naomi Watts stars as Ann Darrow, a vaudeville actress down on her luck in Depression-era New York until manic filmmaker Carl Denham (a game but miscast Jack Black) entices her with a lead role. Dazzled by the genius of screenwriter Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody), Ann boards the tramp steamer S.S.Venture, which she--and most of the wary crew--believes is headed for Singapore. Denham, however, is in search of the mythic Skull Island, hoping to capture its wonders on film and make a fortune. What he didn't count on were some scary natives who find that the comely Darrow looks like prime sacrifice material for a mysterious giant creature....There's no point in rehashing the entire plot, as every movie aficionado is more than familiar with the trajectory ofKing Kong; the challenge facing Jackson, his screenwriters, and the phenomenal visual-effects team was to breathe new life into an old, familiar story. To that degree, they achieve what could be best called a qualified success. Though they've assembled a crackerjack supporting cast, including Thomas Kretschmann as theVenture's hard-bitten captain and young Jamie Bell as a plucky crewman, the first third of the movie is rather labored, with too much minute detail given over to sumptuous re-creations of '30s New York and the unexciting initial leg of theVenture's sea voyage. However, once the film finds its way to Skull Island (which bears more than a passing resemblance toLOTR's Mordor),Kongturns into a dazzling movie triumph, by turns terrifying and awe-inspiring. The choreography and execution of the action set pieces--including one involving Kong and a trio of Tyrannosaurus Rexes, as well as another that could be charitably described as a bug-phobic's nightmare--is nothing short of landmark filmmaking, and a certain Mr. Spielberg should watch his back, asKongtrumps most anything that has come before it.Despite the visual challenges ofKing Kong, the movie's most difficult hurdle is the budding romance between Ann and her simian soulmate. Happily, this is where Jackson unqualifiedly triumphs, as this unorthodox love story is tenderly and humorously drawn, by turns sympathetic and wondrous. Watts, whose accessibility balances out her almost otherworldly loveliness, works wonders with mere glances, and Andy Serkis, who digitally embodies Kong here much as he did Gollum in theLOTRfilms, breathes vibrant life into the giant star of the film without ever overplaying any emotions. The final, tragic act of the film, set mostly atop the Empire State Building, is whereKongearns its place in movie history as a work that celebrates both the technical and emotional heights that film can reach.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"bought_together": ["B000EHQTZO", "B00AEFYEU8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EHQTZO", "B00AEFYEU8", "B0087ZG7HK", "0767817478"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 32487}, "categories": [["Movies & TV"]], "price": 8.94, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JO20", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513Y54TGdwL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "King Kong (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "More than a few critics hailedSpider-Man 2as \"the best superhero movie ever,\" and there's no compelling reason to argue--thanks to a bigger budget, better special effects, and a dynamic, character-driven plot, it's a notch aboveSpider-Manin terms of emotional depth and rich comic-book sensibility.Ordinary PeopleOscar-winner Alvin Sargent received screenplay credit, and celebrated author and comic-book expert Michael Chabon worked on the story, but it's director Sam Raimi's affinity for the material that bringsSpidey 2to vivid life. When a fusion experiment goes terribly wrong, a brilliant physicist (Alfred Molina) is turned into Spidey's newest nemesis, the deranged, mechanically tentacled \"Doctor Octopus,\" obsessed with completing his experiment and killing Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) in the process. Even more compelling is Peter Parker's urgent dilemma: continue his burdensome, lonely life of crime-fighting as Spider-Man, or pursue love and happiness with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst)? Molina's outstanding as a tragic villain controlled by his own invention, and the action sequences are nothing less than breathtaking, but the real success ofSpider-Man 2is its sense of priorities. With all of Hollywood's biggest and best toys at his disposal, Raimi and his writers stay true to the Marvel mythology, honoringSpider-Mancreators Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, and setting the bar impressively high for the challenge ofSpider-Man 3.--Jeff ShannonDVD Features:The first commentary track is by director Sam Raimi and a self-deprecating Tobey Maguire speaking in tandem, and producer (and Marvel CEO) Avi Arad and coproducer Grant Curtis speaking in tandem. They discuss a number of topics, including Raimi's memory of his excitement over Richard Donner's Superman and how the character of Black Cat had to be dropped from the film. The second commentary is by six members of the Oscar-nominated effects team, and one of their primary focuses is how Doc Ock's arms were achieved by a combination of puppetry and CGI.The centerpiece of the second disc is a massive two-hour documentary that can be viewed all at once or in 12 separate pieces. It covers the development of the story, the visual effects, costumes, stunts, and sound and music. Three shorter featurettes cover Peter Parker's struggle between his personal and hero lives, Doc Ock, and the women in Spider-Man's life, and what's interesting is how they discuss those topics not just in relation to the movies but to the comic books as well. (For example, Betty Brant and Gwen Stacy had a much greater impact in the comics.) There's a scene in which you can toggle among three different camera angles, and a gallery of 17 paintings Alex Ross created for the opening sequence. The sound and picture are spectacular, though only theSuperbit editionhas DTS.--David HoriuchiMore Spiderman on DVDTheSpidermanToy StoreThe First FilmSpider Manon the small screenThe SoundtrackGame Boy AdvanceThe BookMore Superheroes on DVDBatmanBladeThe HulkJimmy NeutronJustice LeagueKim PossibleRobocopSpider-ManSupermanWonder WomanX-MenAlso see our Action & Adventure StoreStills fromSpider-Man 2(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000UR9T8C", "B00005JKCH", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00005JNTU", "B000VI70QS", "B001CDR1FG", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000AYELVA", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000AYELVU", "B008JFUO72", "B0083SBMBM", "B004LWZW42", "B004EPZ07K", "B00005JNJV", "B0002IQMAM", "B00E5I2MEK", "B000OVLBF8", "B00E5I2M9K", "B000HEVZ9E", "B008QZ5PY2", "B000HCO83Q", "B00JPS7HOA", "B001QB9H1U", "B00IGVJGYQ", "B0000959N0", "B0007P0Y7C", "B002GSXKN8", "B008JFUPFI", "B000J10EQU", "B0007V6ITE", "B0090SI56Y", "B001GZ6QC4", "6307397594", "B008JFUS0U", "B000IJ79VQ", "B000VR0570", "B002ZG99B8", "B00005JKWJ", "B004LWZWGA", "B005G4TJUC", "B002IPFWTE", "B00005JM5E", "B005LAIGW8", "0767817478", "B000H30B2C", "B002A5EBLW", "B0006L0LOS", "B000U7WV1Y", "B0000VCZLG", "B000P0J06K", "B002GSXKNI", "B002HWRYJE", "B0004Z33EQ", "B0009A409S", "B001DJLD2G", "B000I0RQVI", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B0007RT9MG", "B001GKJ2E8", "B0000AXE8I", "B007K3JFUQ", "B00004STUL", "B00BEZTMFY", "B000P0J06U", "B000957O82", "1402778007", "B0039N74CW", "B003UESJF6", "B00F4FFO8E", "B001HN697M", "B001OST0LW", "B0060FXDCG", "B0049IHX2C", "B000P0J0A6", "B000CEVC9M", "B000UVKGPI", "B009JBWOU0", "B00005JM5B", "B00I6JOD2S", "B001EDVNNU", "B000O77SRC", "B0000633UA", "B000P6XQ50", "B000E8M0VA", "B00008G8M4", "B000EGDB10", "B007REV4T8", "B00BPA2PEI", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B005OY6LBE", "0780624890", "B002935GMS", "0767803434", "6305428042", "B000O78KW4", "B009HIKAN8"], "bought_together": ["B000UR9T8C", "B00005JKCH"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004LWZWFQ", "B003YAR97K", "B00005JKCH", "B000UR9T8C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9593}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.0, "brand": "Marvel Kids", "asin": "B00005JMQW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51529JJX43L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Spider-Man 2 (Widescreen Special Edition)"}

Joseph McCarthy in 1953-54, and emerged as a triumphant truth-seeker against the abuses of corporate and governmental power.David Strathairn as Edward R. MurrowAs played by David Strathairn, Murrow is a dogged realist, keenly aware of the smear tactics that will be employed against him; Clooney provides crucial backup as Murrow's \"See It Now\" producer and closest confidante Fred Friendly, forming a fierce but not entirely fearless triumvirate of broadcasting  bravery with CBS chief William Paley (Frank Langella), who anxiously champions Murrow's cause under constant threat of reprisals. While using crisp black-and-white cinematography (by Robert Elswit) to vividly recreate the electrifying atmosphere of the CBS newsroom and the early years of television, Clooney (son of long-time Cincinnati newsman Nick Clooney) proves his directorial skill by juggling big themes and an esteemed ensemble cast, never stooping to simplification of ethically complex material.Good Night, and Good Luckis an instant classic, destined for all the accolades it so richly deserves.--Jeff ShannonLearn More About Edward R.

{"description": "Queen Latifah demonstrates her loose, easy charm inLast Holiday, a remake of the 1950 comedy with Alec Guinness. Though at first glance it's hard to imagine anyone less like Alec Guinness than Queen Latifah, they both communicate a world of inner thought with nothing more than a sly sideways glance. Georgia Byrd (Latifah), a department store employee, leads a life of frustrated desires--particularly for a bashful salesman from the outdoor furnishings department (LL Cool J,Deep Blue Sea). But when she learns she only has a few weeks left to live, Georgia gathers her money, quits her job, and flies to a swank European resort she's always dreamed of visiting. Naturally, her new carelessness with money and fearless candor lead everyone around her--including her senator (Giancarlo Esposito,Do The Right Thing) and her former boss (Timothy Hutton,Ordinary People)--to think she's a mover and shaker.Last Holidayunfolds the way you expect it to (dozens of movies and TV shows have similar plots), but Latifah and the capable cast keep it alive. Also featuring Alicia Witt (The Upside of Anger), Jane Adams (Happiness), and the ever-dependable Gerard Depardieu (Cyrano de Bergerac) as a passionate chef.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B000MQC9H4", "B003UEYBPI", "B0009X7BFK", "B000098XQ8", "B0013ERFGE", "B00005JN4H", "B001DJLCQS", "B000FUH35U", "B000YAF4Q6", "B007HHWJSA", "B00005JLON", "B000R17RQM", "B003L16FCC", "B001EZE5DS", "B003Y5H58S", "B000065V3J", "B005LAIH86", "B00AEFXY6I", "B000FS9ULC", "B00006RVJR", "B00177YFYM", "B000957O82", "B000093I8L", "B000803BQC", "B00066FAQW", "B000OCZA04", "B001WLMONM", "B00066FAC6", "B00005LB86", "B0014QLEI6", "B001NLJ3NU", "B00164KYV4", "B00BNV9WCW", "B000YGGNMO", "B001QUF7DS", "B0009RCPUW", "B00066FAVW", "B00003CXSM", "B000F3UA5M", "B00004Y2R1", "B000LW7REE", "0783240201", "B0009OL7Z4", "B002K0WBXW", "B004SIP9RO", "B00097DXFS", "B002ZG99RW", "B000CEV3KU", "B0018RNF60", "B00AEFXTKO", "B002CA68NO", "B0000VD02Y", "B001CTA1UM", "0780627822", "B000A343RI", "B004SIP9VA", "B0001Q4BOE", "B00005JPSM", "B0088RMEII", "B00008WJD6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000MQC9H4", "B003UEYBPI", "B005LAIH86", "B0009X7BFK"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JOSG", "imUrl": "http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-site/icons/no-img-sm._CB192198896_.gif", "title": "Last Holiday"}

{"description": "This two-disc collector's edition ofPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chestis packed with over five hours of special features that delve into everything from creating the mythology-inspired Davy Jones and Kraken figures, to working and planning without a completed script, the incredible CGI techniques used in the film, the intense sword training sessions and stunt work, and the unpredictability of filming on location in the Caribbean. The audio commentary by writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio is an interesting and insightful look into the finished film, but perhaps even more revealing is the 25-minute \"Charting the Return\" preproduction diary in which everyone from producer Jerry Bruckheimer to associate director Peter Kohn and writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio give a sense of the enormity of the project of concurrently writing and filming two sequels toPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. The overwhelming logistics of planning and casting without a finished script, scouting and preparing remote locations, constructing a new Black Pearl, and functional props like the rolling water wheel, and cutting costs to stay within budget are nothing less than mind-boggling. In the hourlong \"According to Plan\" feature, director Gore Verbinski, producer Jerry Bruckheimer, and a host of others detail the enormity of the project, focusing on the stamina involved in a 200-day shooting schedule and the need for adaptability and flexibility in dealing with everything from behind schedule excavations to the logistics of shooting on moving water and even the natural fury of a full-blown hurricane.  Shorter featurettes \"Meet Davy Jones: Anatomy of a Legend\" and \"Creating the Kraken\" focus on the mythological creatures in the film and the awesome visual effects and advances in CGI technology that made them possible.  \"Mastering the Blade\" follows Orlando Bloom (Will Turner), Keira Knightley (Elizabeth Swann), and Jack Davenport (Norrington) through some intense sword-fighting training sessions and \"Fly on the Set: The Bone Cage\" offers a frightening look at what it was like to shoot the bone cage scene of the movie.  Other bonus features include bloopers, an interactive tour of Johnny Depp's special makeup effects and wardrobe details, a look at how the 1967 Disney Land Pirates of the Caribbean ride was recently \"re-imagineered\" to incorporate some of the characters and elements from the new movies, producer Jerry Bruckheimer's photo diary, and a glimpse of the glitzy June 24, 2006 red carpet premiere on Disney Land's main street.--Tami Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JM5E", "B005COPWZW", "B004A8ZWUQ", "B0013BM63O", "B00005JN5E", "B004M1A21K", "B004DTLK80", "B000VR0570", "B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY", "B00005JKCH", "B001HN694K", "B00005JPH2", "B00AEFYGBA", "B00BEZTMFY", "B001HQZJMU", "B00E5I2M6I", "B006VRRGNK", "B001BEK8HO", "B000E8M0VA", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B001E75QH0", "B008QE9XD2", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00LG6YEKE", "B00AEBBA72", "B007K3JFUQ", "B000HRMAPE", "B0090SI56Y", "B000E6EK2Y", "B0053FANRC", "B00005JMQW", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B00177YA1K", "B001TK80C0", "B000UR9T8C", "B00003CXI1", "B004EPYZUS", "B00003CXTA", "B001OQCV6A", "B0014Z4ON4", "B005G4TJUC", "B000F7CECK", "B00HFFE8HE", "B001GCUO1Q", "B0087ZG7J8", "B003YAR97K", "B008JFUNTG", "B001GCUO0W", "B000NIBURQ", "B0053FANPY", "B00023B1LC", "B003QO8TOQ", "B002VPE1BQ", "B00F84H73Q", "B003Y5H54W", "B00003CWT6", "B00007AJGH", "B00E5I2M9K", "B000W7F5SS", "B0049IHX2C", "B00000IRE6", "B001F7MSFM", "B000AYELVA", "B002ZG9904", "B000VWYJ86", "B00CFA222M", "B003UYUQZW", "B008UZ949K", "B0002KVUKM", "B000209KMW", "B000UVKGPI", "B0087ZG7HK", "B0000WN140", "B001EZE5BU", "B002PMV9FG", "B000HT386M", "B000NQRR1Q", "B00003CXZ1", "630529142X", "B0002ZDVEU", "B004A8ZWSS", "B00005JM5B", "B000BTITKS", "B00E5I2MEK", "B002HWRYJE", "B001GZ6QC4", "B000W796OM", "B00AQSN7HE", "B0046BI81W", "B001VLBDD0", "B0060FXDCG", "B0084IG8TM", "B005OCFGTO", "B000OLGCIE", "B008JFUS0U", "B00007AJG4", "B009JBWOU0", "B001B3LIOC"], "bought_together": ["B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JM5E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005COPWZW", "B00005JM5E", "B0071JADFU", "B00005JPFX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 72898}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 16.95, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JP0F", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GQE7TQ72L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's Endis a rollicking voyage in the same spirit of the two earlierPiratesfilms, yet far darker in spots (and nearly three hours to boot). The action, largely revolving around a pirate alliance against the ruthless East India Trading Company, doesn't disappoint, though the violence is probably too harsh for young children. Through it all, the plucky cast (Keira Knightley, Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush) are buffeted by battle, maelstroms, betrayal, treachery, a ferocious Caribbean weather goddess, and that gnarly voyage back from the world's end--but with their wit intact. As always, Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow tosses off great lines ; he chastises \"a woman scorned, like which hell hath no fury than!\" He insults an opponent with a string of epithets, ending in \"yeasty codpiece.\"!In the previousThe Curse of the Black Pearl, Sparrow was killed--sent to Davy Jones' Locker. In the opening scenes, the viewer sees that death has  not been kind to Sparrow--but that's not to say he hasn't found endless ways to amuse himself, cavorting with dozens of hallucinated versions of himself on the deck of the Black Pearl. But Sparrow is needed in this world, so a daring rescue brings him back. Keith Richards' much ballyhooed appearance as Jack's dad is little more than a cameo, though he does play a wistful guitar. But the action, as always, is more than satisfying, held together by Depp, who, outsmarting the far-better-armed British yet again, causes a bewigged commander to muse: \"Do you think he plans it all out, or just makes it up as he goes along?\" As far as fans are concerned, it matters not.--A.T. HurleyOn the DVDHere's something you can't say about just any DVD extras: There appears to bemoreof Keith Richards in the outtakes, interviews, and other special features on theAt World's Enddisc than in the actual film. For those scenes alone, this special edition is well worth the price. Richards looks as woozy and gamey as all the rumors suggested, and answers questions he's not asked, with Johnny Depp sitting next to him, almost acting as a translator. Richards offers pithy comments like, \"Everything I do is original, you better believe,\" and smiles when other cast members call him \"Two-Take Richards\" for supposedly nailing his scenes.The packed second disc also includes a terrific mini-doc on how the filmmakers created the famous maelstrom, in an enormous hanger in Palmdale, California, with the ships floating 30 feet off the ground. \"Just moving theBlack Pearlwas an enormous undertaking,\" says producer Jerry Bruckheimer with serious understatement.

{"description": "One of the first things a viewer notices aboutCloverfieldis that it doesn't play by ordinary storytelling rules, making this intriguing horror film as much a novelty as an event. Told from the vertiginous point-of-view of a camcorder-wielding group of friends,Cloverfieldbegins like a primetime television soap opera about young Manhattanites coping with changes in their personal lives. Rob (Michael Stahl-David) is leaving New York to take an executive job at a company in Japan. At his goodbye party in a crowded loft, Rob&#x92;s brother Jason (Mike Vogel) hands a camcorder to best friend Hud (T.J. Miller), who proceeds to tape the proceedings over old footage of Rob&#x92;s ex-girlfriend, Beth (Odette Yustman)--images shot during happy times in that now-defunct relationship. Naturally, Beth shows up at the party with a new beau, bumming Rob out completely. Just before one's eyes glaze over from all this heartbreaking stuff (captured by Hud, who's something of a doofus, in laughably shaky camerawork), the unexpected happens: New York is suddenly under attack from a Godzilla-like monster stomping through midtown and destroying everything and everybody in sight. Rob and company hit the streets, but rather than run with other evacuees, they head toward the center of the storm so that Rob can rescue an injured Beth. There are casualties along the way, but the journey into fear is fascinating and immediate if emotionally remote--a consequence of seeing these proceedings through the singular, subjective perspective of a camcorder and of a story that intentionally leaves major questions unanswered: Who or what is this monster? Where did it come from? The lack of a backstory, and spare views of the marauding creature, are clever ways by producer J.J. Abrams and director Matt Reeves to keep an audience focused exclusively on what&#x92;s on the screen.  But it also makesCloverfieldcuriously uninvolving. Ultimately,Cloverfield, with its spectacular effects brilliantly woven into a home-video look, is a celebration of infinite possibilities in this age of accessible, digital media.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B004EPYZQ2", "B00IO9D3ZI", "B00EMMDMKM", "B002SJIO5E", "B0044ZOI32", "B001AR0D4A", "B004BZ5AMS", "B001MVYUQQ", "B003BJO8KU", "B0018AG6X6", "B005LAIGPU", "B00IO8VMB6", "B000PKG8SS", "B003Y5H5GU", "B00BPA2PGG", "B0017U7PT6", "B001YV502C", "B0013FBS20", "B008JFUR10", "B001KZVQJI", "B001CW7ZW6", "B0035WTJFW", "B000Y7U98W", "B003ABZGRI", "B000VDDWEC", "B000VDDWEM", "B002JT69IM", "B00164EAC8", "B002ZG981E", "B00AEFXORM", "B001DZOC3W", "B008SAPC20", "B003Y5H59M", "B00HERVMTK", "B00AVSFIV2", "B0032KNA4I", "B000L212HW", "B001FB55I0", "B0018O4YSQ", "B002ZG997M", "B002ZG9788", "B008G33O0G", "B000VDDWE2", "B00K2CHVSK", "B001GCUO5W", "B005J4TLQG", "B000PC6A3E", "B0027VT9ES", "B001F7MSG6", "B0051T46XM", "B00111YM60", "B001GZ6QEC", "B002HR1W1K", "B004SIPA4G", "B001OQCVII", "B001JNNDBA", "B001GKJ2FC", "B000WQWPKA", "B000OT6V00", "B0021L8UXK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004EPYZQ2", "B00IO8VMB6", "B004LWZW4W", "B005LAIHY0"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPXY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Wm5GO98oL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cloverfield [Theatrical Release]"}
{"description": "\"I bought a car. Turned out to be an alien robot. Who knew?\" deadpans Sam Witwicky, hero and human heart of Michael Bay's rollicking robot-smackdown fest,Transformers. Witwicky (the sweetly nerdy Shia LaBeouf, channeling a young John Cusack) is the perfect counterpoint to the nearly nonstop exhilarating action. The plot is simple: an alien civil war (the Autobots vs. the evil Decepticons) has spilled onto Earth, and young Sam is caught in the fray by his newly purchased souped-up Camaro. Which has a mind--and identity, as a noble-warrior robot named Bumblebee--of its own. The effects, especially the mind-blowing transformations of the robots into their earthly forms and back again, are stellar.Fans of the earlier film and TV series will be thrilled at this cutting-edge incarnation, but this version should please all fans of high-adrenaline action. Director Bay gleefully salts the movie with homages to pop-culture touchstones likeRaiders of the Lost Ark,King Kong, and the early technothrillerWarGames. The actors, though clearly all supporting those kickass robots, are uniformly on-target, including the dashing Josh Duhamel as a U.S. Army sergeant fighting an enemy he never anticipated; Jon Voight, as a tough yet sympathetic Secretary of Defense in over his head; and John Turturro, whose special agent manages to be confidently unctuous, even stripped to his undies. But the film belongs to Bumblebee, Optimus Prime, and the dastardly Megatron--and the wicked stunts they collide in all over the globe. Long live Transformers! --A.T. HurleyOn the DVDThe special edition ofTransformersis packed with extras (and more than a few product placements for Hasbro). The entire second disc is devoted to featurettes on aspects of making the technical tour-de-force--and the land mines involved in tinkering with a beloved '80s franchise. Executive producer Steven Spielberg is very much a part of the proceedings, from his introductory comments (\"I think everybody likes the idea of taking something you're familiar with and turning it into something you're not so familiar with--like an 18-wheeler become Optimus Prime\") to mentions of his films that influenced this one, likeE.T.andClose Encounters of the Third Kind.Director Michael Bay is brash and entertaining as he talks about his initial reluctance to take on the project, his indoctrination at \"Transformers U\" at Hasbro, and his enthusiasm for guerrilla-style action filmmaking. Star Shia LaBoeuf says, \"He is the sickest action director\" out there, and there's plenty of evidence here to support that. Other great highlights include features on how key scenes were shot, including the heart-pounding desert battle and the shootout in the streets of downtown L.A.--adrenaline-pumping stuff, even without the Transformers CGI'd in. --A.T.

{"description": "Alas! The fifthHarry Potterfilm has arrived. The time is long past that this can be considered a simple \"children's\" series--though children and adults alike will enjoy it immensely. Starting off from the dark and tragic ending of the fourth film,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenixbegins in a somber and angst-filled tone that carries through the entire 138 minutes (the shortest of anyHPmovie despite being adapted from the longest book). Hopes of winning the Quidditch Cup have been replaced by woes like government corruption, distorted media spin, and the casualties of war. As the themes have matured, so have the primary characters' acting abilities. Ron (Rupert Grint), Hermione (Emma Watson), and especially Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) are more convincing than ever--in roles that are more demanding.Harry is deeply traumatized from having witnessed Cedric Diggory's murder, but he will soon find that this was just another chapter in the continuing loss he will endure. Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) has returned and, in an attempt to conceal this catastrophe from the wizarding public, the Ministry of Magic has teamed up with the wizard newspaperThe Daily Prophetto smear young Potter and wise Dumbledore (Michael Gambon)--seemingly the only two people in the public eye who believe the Dark Lord has returned. With no one else to stand against the wicked Death Eaters, the Hogwarts headmaster is forced to revive his secret anti-Voldemort society, the Order of the Phoenix. This welcomes back characters like Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson), kind Remus Lupin (David Thewlis), fatherly Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), and insidious Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), and introduces a short list of intriguing new faces. In the meantime, a semi-psychotic bureaucrat from the Ministry (brilliantly portrayed by Imelda Staunton) has seized power at Hogwarts, and Harry is forced to form a secret society of his own--lest the other young wizards at his school be left ill-equipped to defend themselves in the looming war between good and evil. In addition, Harry is filled with an inexplicable rage that only his Godfather Sirius seems to be able to understand.This film, though not as frightening as its predecessor, earns its PG-13 rating mostly because of the ever-darkening tone.  As always, the loyal fans of J.K. Rowling's books will suffer huge cuts from the original plot and character developments, but make no mistake: this is agoodmovie.--Jordan ThompsonOn the DVDThe second disc ofThe Order of the Phoenixfeatures \"The Hidden Secrets of Harry Potter,\" a retrospective on the series so far, with \"Potter experts\" (i.e., people who run fan sites) weighing in on what's to come. This must have been filmed during production, because all their speculation about the conclusion of the saga is clearly dated and therefore superfluous (sinceOrderreleased theatrically at the same time as the seventh book, one would've expected a more current analysis). Many of the deleted scenes are mostly extensions, with the exception of one hilarious take of Professor Trelawney (Emma Thompson) trying--unsuccessfully--to eat gracefully during Dolores Umbridge's introduction at Hogwarts. The chatty actress Natalia Tena, who plays Tonks, gives a tour of the set in \"Trailing Tonks,\" even playing a Christmas song she wrote on her guitar, and director David Yates and editor Mark Day demonstrate editing 101 with a feature that lets you edit your own scene from the movie. Watch the feature but skip the self-editing part; the controls are too complicated to navigate and too frustrating to work properly (plus, hit the wrong button and you've gone all the way back to the beginning). A digital copy of the movie is also included on the bonus disc.--Ellen A.

{"description": "Produced by World Wrestling Entertainment mogul Vince McMahon,See No Evila standard-issue death-fest designed for maximum gross-out appeal, and in that sense it delivers the goods with crushed heads, multiple eye-gougings, throat-rippings and other grisly fates that gore fans will want to discover for themselves. If your idea of a good time is watching a mangy dog urinate into the vacant eye socket of a corpse, this is just the movie for you! In an attempt to create a new horror icon like Freddy Krueger or Jason Voorhees, former porno director Gregory Dark and less-than-stellar screenwriter Dan Madigan have dreamed up a routine plot that's hardly original, but deviously addictive to anyone who digs this kind of stuff: Eight troubled and not-very-bright teens, fresh out of a detention center, are given a second chance when they're taken to the decrepit, filthy Blackwell Hotel and told to clean the place up so it can be turned into a homeless shelter. What they don't know is that the hotel hides a secret, axe-wielding resident named Jacob Goodnight (played by WWE superstar Glen \"Kane\" Jacobs) who's got a knack for plucking the eyeballs from his hapless and ill-fated victims. He's basically an evil kid in the hulking body of a wrestler (call it type-casting, if you will), andSee No Evilis more sick than scary as Jacob does his handiwork, which includes the rather hilarious and grimly ironic dispatch of an animal rights activist, to name just one item in the movie's smorgasbord of splatter. At a brisk 85 minutes, the movie's over before you can work up any genuine terror. Still, a sequel seems likely (even if it's straight-to-video), and devoted horror fans will want to check it out.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B001LPWGC8", "B00009ZPU3", "B003L20IF6", "B000SM6FKY", "B002S0OB8W", "B0021L8UG2", "B001053038", "B001QB9H2E", "B000RGN2IY", "B001B1876G", "B002NPY7F4", "B0029XFN94", "B001R10BIC", "B002DKGWSO", "B00546031G", "B004SEUJVO", "B003PBYSTA", "B004RQDWIU", "B003Y5H4SY", "B002QVFOOI", "B000I5XOV4", "B00275EHDW", "B005LS4MUA", "B00005JOWW", "B003C5FMJE", "B003Q6D282", "B000KX0HH8", "B005DCJ218", "B004SIP9GK", "B004634VFM", "B0021L8UHQ", "B001AQMBHI", "B000HCO80E", "B001RHGRSY", "B00194XBPW", "B0029O0BMC", "B004CJB0A4", "B0021L8UQ2", "B001MFNB4E", "B003Y5H5G0", "B000EWBKLC", "B000O5B4CE", "B00LLAV26O", "B002JT69IM", "B0058O1FNO", "B002CVQAX6", "B002CVQAXQ", "B001FBJUXG", "B005DCJ1J6", "B00AIBZL14", "B001MVYUQQ", "B004GGQMUQ", "B008XAT118", "B0029O0BJU", "B004LOUD80", "B002NPY7EU", "B003H9LIRA", "B004BLTNL6", "B001M9ELP8", "B0021L8UXK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002QVFOOI", "B0057YUV6C", "B00E8RK5OC", "B000UJ48UO"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JOZS", "imUrl": "http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-site/icons/no-img-sm._CB192198896_.gif", "title": "See no Evil Art Prints &amp; Posters"}

{"description": "For anyone who thought the Oscar-winning documentaryMarch of the Penguinswas the most marvelous cinematic moment for these nomads of the south, you haven't seen nothing yet.Happy Feetis an animated wonder about a penguin named Mumble who can't sing, but can dance up a storm. George Miller, the driving force behind theBabe(andMad Max) movies, takes another creative step in family entertainment with this big, beautiful, music-fueled film that will have kids and their parents dancing in the streets. From his first moment alive, Mumble (voiced Elijah Woods) feels the beat and can't stop dancing. Unfortunately, emperor penguins are all about finding their own heart song, and the dancing youngster--as cute as he is--is a misfit. Luckily, he bumps into little blue penguins and a Spanish-infused group (led by Robin Williams) and begins a series of adventures. Miller has an exceptional variety of entertainment: Busby Berkley musical numbers, amusement-park thrills, exciting chase sequences (seals and orca lovers might like think otherwise), and even an environmental message that doesn't weigh you down. Best of all, you don't know where the movie is going in the last act, a rare occurrence these days in family entertainment. A fusion of rock songs, mashed-up and otherwise, are featured; this movie is as much a musical as a comedy. Mumble's solo dance to a new version of Stevie Wonder's \"I Wish\" by Fantasia, Patti, and Yolanda may be the most joyful moment on camera in 2006.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006UEVT0", "B001DPHDCY", "B0006JMLRK", "B0012EM5D8", "B004HO6I4M", "B004EPZ0AC", "B002WJI2QQ", "B000AY74OG", "B0000AOX0O", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B00005JNQS", "B000RMJ4F8", "B0000640SC", "B005SDUV4E", "0783231474", "B00003CXJ4", "B00CWM58WY", "B0000VV4W2", "B0042U94UQ", "B0039N74CW", "6305161887", "B00AEFXMSS", "B000M343BC", "B00007LVCM", "B001ECQ75A", "B00005JNS0", "B00000JL8E", "B000GUJZ00", "B000056H26", "B008NNY9QW", "B004EPZ034", "B00G5G7EXY", "B000LPS2VI", "B005LAIH4A", "B00F522C7C", "B005LAIISA", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B007FF3HQM", "B000VBJEEG", "B003H9M1Q2", "B00029LO0Y", "B008JFUQ16", "B00005JMQZ", "B00EV1YZ96", "B000ION23A", "B0013FSL3E", "B003ZHVJGO", "B002ZG97YM", "B001NCDFTW", "B004G600A4", "B00009YXAW", "B005LAIHW2", "B00AFEX83C", "B00475B0H6", "B000UVKGPI", "B00ALMNCLQ", "B00HLTD2OE", "B00005JM7T", "B001HN6922", "B000BI5KV0", "B0013FSWT2", "B0030IIZ4M", "B004ODLUGM", "B001GCUO7A", "B005F96UJ6", "B000UFIYOO", "B000G75AZC", "B00005QFE1", "B0000VCZKW", "B00IEXX4KS", "B001THIQFO", "B000A2WAQK", "B001GCUNWQ", "B00B7EQPNE", "B002NZK5SW", "B0007PIDBQ", "B00AOCDDGC", "B000V5IP6U", "B0044RFTD8", "B00AEFXMGU", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00CHVJODE", "B000CZ0PT4", "B006JD48LO", "B0007Z0NYG", "B00EBBGLFC", "B00003CXB4", "B000BMGEJI", "B008YWY0HK", "B0002YLCOM", "B00E9ZATJO", "B004A8ZX3C", "B00I6JOD2S", "B005G3VCYY", "B00CQRN3QI", "B004OWQTZ0", "B0001OGUQI", "B004EPZ01G", "B00005JMFH", "B000GIXEWC"], "bought_together": ["B004HO6I4M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004HO6I4M", "B00EBBGLFC", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00HR3D56O"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 21763}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.51, "brand": "Warner", "asin": "B00005JPCF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51sX2Hrdz6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Happy Feet (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Italian horror master Mario Bava brought his considerable skills to bear on this hypnotic genre hybrid, creating one of the most eerily atmospheric science fiction films ever made. A spaceship is lured to a mysterious planet, where members of its crew are slaughtered, and their bodies possessed by a near-extinct alien race--a minimalist plot, to be sure, but in the hands of Bava and cinematographer Antonio Rinaldi,Planet of the Vampires(the best-known of this film's many titles) is a near-masterpiece of style over substance. The simplest sets and backdrops are composed with a perfect eye for perspective and color, with sensible spaceship design and memorable costumes that look like they sprang from the futuristic fantasies of an S&M; biker gang. Performances are secondary but effectively low-key, serving to enhance Bava's painterly use of matte work and miniatures.

Fans accustomed to the slick appearance of the later episodes will be delighted by the rougher nature of these earlier episodes, when the characters weren't as well defined (Homer isn't quite as dumb as he is in later seasons) and the animation was still evolving. This only adds to the charm of these 13 episodes, which begin with \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire,\" the December 1989 Christmas special in which a down-and-out Simpson family adopt Santa's Little Helper. Throughout the season, familiar faces are introduced, as we catch first glimpses of Smithers, Mr. Burns, the Flanderses, and Patty and Selma. Highlights of the season include \"The Crepes of Wrath,\" in which Bart is sent to France as an exchange student (\"Don't mess up France the way you messed up your room\"); \"Bart the Genius,\" in which Bart ends up in a school for the gifted; and \"Krusty Gets Busted,\" in which Bart's lifelong animosity with Sideshow Bob begins.--Jenny Brown", "related": {"also_bought": ["B007KFZ7UQ", "B007KFZ8AK", "B007KFZ8B4", "B007KFZ8AA", "B000067DNE", "B007KFZ7YM", "B007KFZ7Q0", "B007KFZ7PG", "B007KFZ87S", "B007KFZ88M", "B001GQ3GHG", "B0024FAR52", "B001L1S1PI", "B003KZ27N0", "B005QIOJ3A", "B000WGYMD8", "B000WGYMGK", "B000BQPC42", "B009DW5YJI", "B00F4NPBI4", "B00023P49C", "B0012KSUTA", "B00009N80Z", "B000E6ES9O", "B002R8JE7S", "B000083C6V", "B009DW5X0I", "B008412UKA", "B003KZ27NA", "B005QIOJ6M", "B00L89VL96", "B000NNK4DM", "B00F4NPBAC", "B00008YGRV", "B00005JM3G", "B000B5XOWU", "B00008YGRS", "B00JDFTN60", "B0006Z2L2Y", "B0002PYS60", "B0000CABL2", "0062267752", "B007ZFR67I", "B00023P49M", "B002DKGWSE", "B000HT3P6U", "B0072BNKHA", "B0077ATSSQ", "B001E6HUXO", "B00AIANIPQ", "B001MVWRNE", "B001VFM0ZG", "B00JNB80YU", "B00HX14C7Q", "B000ADWCYY", "B0006Q93CO", "B00008EY6Q", "B008JFUO0Y", "1612185916", "B0000C2IQB", "B006W93ELK", "B005LAIHY0", "B00HN9D22Y", "B00JO5LJG6", "B001FB55HQ", "B001VLBDD0", "B009SQ9Q5M", "B00C7E3E7S", "B001AQO3QA", "B0024FAD9W", "B002N5N5SO", "B000EQHXOG", "B009LDD40U", "B001CK1D44", "B003Y5H5EW", "B0014Z4OMU", "B00I099K4U", "B003L77GDS", "B00JHH1VUU", "0785154620", "B00BUWD7Y8", "B000ELJAEM", "B005LAIIMG", "B002FOQXTQ", "B008MCKL5W", "B00IMIGWD6", "B00DQC2FPM", "B0087ZG7HK", "B00GZ0ML4C", "B00AO686MY", "B001QIVEVE", "B00005JG6M", "B0001I561E", "0385352107", "B00I0VTPWA"], "bought_together": ["B007KFZ7UQ", "B007KFZ8AK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007KFZ7UQ", "B007KFZ8AA", "B007KFZ7YM", "B00F4NPBI4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 70952}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 23.24, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B00005ML6Y", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P2P9TQYCL._SX300_.jpg", "title": "The Simpsons: The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "In the mid-1960s, with Dalekmania sweeping Britain, BBC TV'sDoctor Whomaterialized on the silver screen.Doctor Who and the Daleksreplaced William Hartnell with Peter Cushing and remade the Daleks' TV debut with a much bigger budget in Technicolor and Techniscope. With his two granddaughters, Roberta Tovey and Jennie Linden (and Roy Castle along for comic relief), the Doctor becomes an intermediary in a conflict between the robotic Daleks and angelic Thals on the almost-dead world of Skaro. A huge hit on release, the film remains an enjoyable, well-produced family adventure, though somewhat lacking the menace of the TV original.Daleks: Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.remakes the second Dalek TV serial and finds the Doctor and companions in a ravaged future London where a resistance movement has literally gone underground to fight the Nazi-like alien invaders. Peter Cushing once more makes a kindly, dependable Doctor, though Bernard Cribbins is given a cringe-making comedy routine impersonating a \"roboman,\" and the jazzy soundtrack is wildly out of place. Nevertheless this is a superior sequel, offering lavish production values, better action set pieces, and a higher suspense and fear factor than its predecessor. The best moments remain surprisingly chilling even today.The three-DVD set includesDalekmania, a fun, very well made 1995 documentary running 57 minutes and recounting the production of both feature films. Included are interviews with various surviving cast members.Doctor Who and the Daleks--the first disc--has an affectionate commentary track with Roberta Tovey and Jennie Linden, hosted by Jonathan Southcote, author ofThe Cult Films of Peter Cushing. SadlyDaleks: Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.has no substantial extra features, but both films include the respective trailer presented anamorphically enhanced and a DVD-ROM reproduction of the relevant movie brochure. The mono sound is good and the sharp, vibrant, anamorphically enhanced 2.35:1 transfers are all but flawless, making both films look good as new.--Gary S.

Oedekerk&#x92;s doofus humor and askew sight gags run a bit dry here--it lacks the lunatic inspiration ofThumb Warsand the gonzo goofiness ofThe Blair Thumb Project--but this third \"thumbation\" farce is kept above water by moments of absurd invention, oddball twists, and the most eccentric and inspired mutant thumb puppets to wiggle through a movie spoof.

{"description": "A sleeper when released in 1985,The Journey of Natty Gannhas since become an enduring family classic. While following a familiar Disney formula (the perilous adventures of a girl and her pet wolf), director Jeremy Paul Kagan adds something fresh at every turn, aided by a first-rate cast and beautifully scenic locations. Then-promising newcomer Meredith Salenger is perfect in the title role--a scrappy kid in Depression-era Chicago who travels cross-country to the Pacific Northwest, hoping to find her father (Ray Wise), who had been forced to leave her with an awful landlady while he took a logging job in Washington. Natty befriends the wolf and a fellow drifter (John Cusack, in an early role), and her journey is a memorable one, intense and realistic but still appropriate for kids. Although Salenger's subsequent film career has been modest (she later graduatedcum laudefrom Harvard),Natty Gannremains a worthy claim to fame.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000B8QG36", "B0001I562S", "B0000633U5", "B0000633U4", "B00005JLHX", "B003ZVJFEI", "B000A2WAQU", "B00007JMDX", "B0000633U6", "B0001I55Y2", "B00005RRG7", "0671606492", "B008Y1YKOE", "B0001I562I", "B000F4PDF8", "B00007GZR8", "B0009X75QU", "B00006675T", "B00005RRGB", "0792833759", "B001B73Q2K", "B000089G5L", "B000AJJNIG", "B0001I5628", "6304711913", "B00005JKVU", "B0000DZ3EK", "B006M0MKC8", "B00006472U", "B00005TPMM", "B006OKOZLU", "B000053VB2", "B00004RFHN", "6305128952", "B00005JLJC", "B003ZVJFGQ", "B0007UDC80", "B003TNS3HC", "B002CLBJPK", "B00005LK94", "B008H6GHEM", "B0001I563M", "B00005JN0Q", "B00007GZZW", "B006XMK11W", "B000G28NPQ", "6305613532", "6305428514", "B00006L949", "B0001I55UQ", "B000OTHVX6", "B00005T7HZ", "B008D9NI54", "B000059TFU", "B000Y11BBC", "B00077BPA0", "B00005OCMS", "B00005U5AG", "B0000VCZKM", "6305428506", "6305161887", "B000065V42", "156371616X", "B000HT389E", "B00007ELF1", "B0001I55U6", "B001CUBF6A", "B00AKGG6S4", "B002NZK5SW", "B00EU8RBXW", "6305428395", "B000Y11B7G", "0783232047", "B00005JPT0", "B0006FYOTC", "B000065V3X", "B001SXZ7TC", "B0000844M8", "6305236569", "B0001AW14C", "B001HY3B36", "B000FVQLM0", "B00287Z18Y", "B00005LKI0", "B002GHHHNI", "B000069I1J", "B008H6GHHY", "B0001I55P6", "B0024FADAQ", "B00008L3UF", "6305320950", "B000089779", "B003RHZ6IE", "B0000DZTIT"], "bought_together": ["B000B8QG36", "B0001I562S"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000B8QG36", "B0000633U4", "B0001I562S", "B0000633U5"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 20841}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.23, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B000065V3A", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N9MDYE9VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Journey of Natty Gann"}

{"description": "From the moment Vic Perrin's omniscient \"Control Voice\" first proclaimed, \"There is nothing wrong with your television set,\" on September 16, 1963,The Outer Limitswas destined for greatness. The dazzling, long-beloved series was a daring experiment in \"omnibus\" TV, trading the speculative fantasies ofThe Twilight Zonefor farther-out sci-fi concepts. Producers Leslie Stevens and Joseph Stefano had risen as gifted writers from (respectively) Broadway and Hollywood; Stevens rebounded from his previous canceled series, while Stefano had scripted Hitchcock'sPsychoand was eager to expand his creative horizons. With an executive order for scary monsters and cold war thrills, their fruitful symbiosis was preceded by the superb Stevens-directed pilot \"Please Stand By,\" named after the series' once-proposed title and changed to \"The Galaxy Being\" for its broadcast premiere.Cliff Robertson launched an impressive succession of guest stars, and on meager, oft-exceeded budgets of $120,000 per episode,The Outer Limitsbecame a showcase for shoestring ingenuity. The \"blue ribbon crew\" (as Stevens called it) included cinematographer Conrad Hall, whose Oscar&#xAE;-winning skills were honed on the series' cramped TV-studio sets. Packed onto four double-sided DVDs, these 32 episodes (out of a total 49) comprise the series' dynamic first season of moody, frequently paranoid black-and-white adventures. Repeat performers Martin Landau, Robert Culp, and Sally Kellerman excel (respectively) in the fan-favorite episodes \"The Man Who Was Never Born,\" \"The Architects of Fear,\" and \"The Bellero Shield\" (and who can forget the insect-like menace of \"The Zanti Misfits\"?). There are a few clunkers, of course, but the series' quality (and parade of monsters) is remarkably consistent, and DVD compression doesnotcompromise its technical achievement. These eerily seductive shows invite repeated viewing, supporting Stephen King's oft-quoted remark thatThe Outer Limitswas \"the best program of its type ever to run on network TV.\"--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000QTCY7M", "B00009Y3RE", "B000OPOAKW", "B000B5IP4W", "B003BNO9GO", "B006TBYC76", "B001DXS4DI", "B0007CEXUY", "B001HNDR4A", "B005UL4NF2", "B0002CX1M0", "B000AL733G", "B0088R9KFI", "B000RPCT5W", "B002NPY7GS", "B002DMJM7K", "B000HDR814", "B00068NVLQ", "B00005JKFR", "B003OW6JAG", "B003NOGNQU", "B00D9EJFZA", "B00GT4NCBU", "B000TXPXD2", "B0002J4ZX2", "B00FEOYY8G", "B000FVQLKW", "B00BQK4YDC", "B00BI3XZA0", "B0042FJCKS", "B0016MOWNM", "B00005R1O7", "0441370810", "B000PISZ86", "B00EEEHLKU", "B000NOIX66", "B000UX6TJI", "B0002NRRRE", "B004E5BQDW", "B00GOC752E", "B0007XG2YS", "B0000V4906", "B0045Z2W0C", "B0002XVQNK", "B009D1G9S4", "B001LM64VA", "B003VJTGNE", "B0006HBV3C", "B00FGAKEEQ", "B000H5U5EE", "B008XB2UCE", "B00013D54Y", "B0002IQKAY", "B000UYN9M2", "B0007R4T26", "B001AXOFR0", "B000EHSVJG", "B00114XLZK", "0767810864", "B0024396EM", "B00005JOJE", "B00012L786", "B002MJV786", "B00092ZLDK", "B000BOH8Z0", "B000RXVNDI", "B00E5G03I4", "B009OE2O2A", "B0044O1Q60", "B009OE2O3Y", "B00004RFAY", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B003CPPY0Q", "B002FLOTPO", "B000HWZ4HU", "B000SMNK16", "B001A7GOCA", "B00CA4S024", "B00008YLVB", "B000R7I48G", "B00004REEI", "B0001US8F8", "B0006BAWYM", "B001DHXT3Y", "B009OE2O0C", "B0006HBV32", "B003KSO3QQ", "B00ADRYGSC", "B00004Y87O", "B003VPEAHK", "B0007R4SZY", "B0002S94BQ", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B00005NSXY", "B001MT7ZJC", "B004VUNVEM", "B003Y7J8DG", "B0000AKY54", "B002H047OG", "B001OXLGKA"], "bought_together": ["B000QTCY7M", "B000OPOAKW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0016MOWNM", "B000OPOAKW", "B000QTCY7M", "B00009Y3RE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 25413}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 98.99, "brand": "", "asin": "B000068V9R", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HCRFZHX7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Outer Limits - The Original Series, Season 1"}

{"description": "The epic sci-fi seriesBabylon 5was a unique experiment in the history of television. It was effectively a novel for television in five seasons, consisting of 110 episodes with a clear beginning, middle, and end. The first season introduces the main characters, headed this year by Commander Jeffery Sinclair (Michael O'Hare) and Security Chief Michael Garibaldi (Jerry Doyle), and familiarizes the audience with the unique environment of a five-mile-long space station in the year 2257.The first episode, \"Midnight on the Firing Line,\" plays at a breathless pace, introducing Commander Susan Ivanova (Claudia Christian) and establishing the conflict between the Narn and Centauri races as represented by their ambassadors, G'Kar (Andreas Katsulas) and Londo Mollari (Peter Jurasik). Then follow several mediocre episodes that initially give the impression thatB5is aStar Trekclone afflicted with \"silly alien of the week\" syndrome. With \"And the Sky Full of Stars,\"B5really begins to hit its stride, Sinclair being forced to relive his mysterious experiences during the Earth-Minbari war. Filler shows such as \"TKO\" are notable only for being controversially violent, while the disappointing \"Grail\" points to writer-creator J. Michael Straczynski's fascination with Arthurian mythology. \"Signs and Portents\" introduces the sinister Mr. Morden (Ed Wasser) and offers the chilling first appearance of the Shadows, an ancient alien threat.B5hits warp speed with a run of exceptional episodes building to the season finale. The two-part \"Voice in the Wilderness\" has Mars breaking into open revolt against Earth and the discovery of a \"Great Machine\" on the dead world Epsilon 3. Referencing 1950s sci-fi classicForbidden Planet, the story leads to the superb  time-travel-based \"Babylon Squared.\" Season finale \"Chrysalis\" proves more than just the usual television cliffhanger, placing Minbari ambassador Delenn in conflict with her ruling Grey Council and forcing on her a decision that laid the groundwork forBabylon 5's eventually becoming a great love story.--Gary S.

{"description": "The duke of York, nicknamed Bertie, was born as royal 'spare heir', younger brother to the prince of Wales, and thus expected to spend a relatively private life with his Scottish wife Elisabeth Bowes-Lyon and their daughters, in the shadow of their reigning father, George V, and next that of his elder brother who succeeded to the British throne as Edward VIII. However Edward decides to put his love for a divorced American, Wallis Simpson, above dynastic duty, and ends up abdicating the throne, which now falls to Bertie, who reigns as George VI. Now he expects to be, as constitutional monarch, little more then a figure head, but again faith has more in store for him: Nazi Germany proves such a formidable war challenger to the British Empire that the nearly desperate nation looks to its royal couple as comforting symbol of the unbroken spirit, a part they play with great success, while hosting chased monarchs and governments from continental Europe. After victory, life returns to normal, but pulmonary disease soon ends George's, leaving the throne to his still young firstborn, queen Elisabeth II. \n\n16:9 Anamorphic Wide Screen\nEnglish\nEnglish\nRegion 2\nDolby Digital Stereo English\nDolby Digital Stereo", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0054DPLUC", "B000NTM9ZW", "B00005O7N8", "B00015HXDG", "B001B1Q2UO", "B004XYOQU4", "B001C4AFOY", "B000EOTELI", "B00BHO0STG", "B00BXTH44C", "B0059XTV4Y", "0767827775", "B0056C1M2M", "B000EMGF2Q", "B000EHQUGC", "B000JLTS80", "B000RF7XYY", "B000A8AXXG", "B0001KL5M6", "B003UESJH4", "B004SIP98S", "B007I6LHN8", "B000Z8H0IC", "B003AND1SM", "B009L2EW5W", "B005DVIQ2K", "B00005JLJP", "B007TBJD1K", "B005B1A0VM", "B000ND91S6", "B001L57ZZG", "B00GM7STPI", "B0080QOL10", "B000BKDNX0", "B00GJT2OWS", "B007HW8U2Y", "B004JMSIQS", "B000GH3CQG", "B004XC5LQE", "B00342ANSA", "B00005AUJT", "B007A2O3FO", "B004GJYRLY", "B0000AQS3P", "B00BQXTDIU", "B003WEAVZU", "B001AZIRVI", "B002CWKTUA", "B00IK481FO", "B00336M8DK", "B003WEAVZK", "B000BITVAG", "B00GPWEPZ8", "B000E8QV74", "B0012IV3Q4", "B008UQUS26", "B00062IZ0Y", "B0046ZYEUW", "B000FL7C9G", "B005RJ6A5S", "B000V02CO6", "B00005JOA0", "B00J44G7H8", "B000E0ODZE", "B00HUAH14Q", "B000784WNQ", "B0013NAMLK", "B00A4E8E78", "B00F1BFRA6", "B0059XTUVI", "B003WEAW04", "B000G6BM0K", "B000RF7XYO", "B005VUTRGW", "B00IT3KP96", "B000M2E32M", "B000089QEM", "B000ZOXDFA", "B0099Y2MYK", "B004H1UAIA", "B007701RFS", "B00C888NRO", "0767812115", "0688035531", "B00DW5ILF6", "B00CIUGD8S", "B000TLTCPY", "B005S9EJ14", "B0059XTV7Q", "B00DL48BM6", "B00CLH0C1M", "B000GIXLUC", "B00JX3SHIC", "B00EF0NVGQ", "B00IKM5OTW", "0671218107", "B004FM2EL2", "B009T6CXG0", "B0090XUARQ", "B000EBD9VC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00015HXDG", "B001C4AFOY", "B00005O7N8", "B001B1Q2UO"]}, "price": 10.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 686382}, "asin": "B00006JY7C", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51W4HHEBERL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bertie and Elizabeth"}

{"description": "If you don't thinkAustin Powers: International Man of Mystery(1997) is one of the funniest movies of the 1990s, maybe you should be packed into a cryogenic time chamber and sent back to the decade whence you came. Perhaps it was the 1960s--the shagadelic decade when London hipster Austin Powers scored with gorgeous chicks as a fashion photographer by day, crime-fighting international man of mystery by night. Yeah, baby, yeah! But when Powers's arch nemesis, Dr. Evil, puts himself into a deep-freeze and travels via time machine to the late 1990s, Powers must follow him and foil Evil's nefarious scheme of global domination. Mike Myers plays dual roles as Powers and Dr. Evil, with Elizabeth Hurley as his present-day sidekick and karate-kicking paramour. A hilarious spoof of '60s spy movies, this colorful comedy actually gets funnier with successive viewings, making it a perfect home video for gloomy days and randy nights. Oh, behave!\"I put the grrr in swinger, baby!\" a deliciously randy Powers coos near the beginning ofThe Spy Who Shagged Me(1999), and if the imagination of Austin creator Mike Myers seems to have sagged a bit, his energy surely hasn't. This friendly, go-for-broke sequel finds our man Austin heading back to the '60s to keep perennial nemesis Dr. Evil (Myers again) from blowing up the world--and, more importantly, to get back his mojo, that man-juice that turns Austin into irresistible catnip for women, especially American spygirl Felicity Shagwell (a pretty but vacant Heather Graham). The plot may be irreverent and illogical, the jokes may be bad, and the scenes may run on too long, but it's all delivered sunnily and with tongue firmly in cheek. Myers teams Dr. Evil with a diminutive clone, Mini-Me (Verne J. Troyer), then pulls a hat trick by playing a third character, the obese and disgusting Scottish assassin Fat Bastard.Despite symptoms of sequelitis,Austin Powers in Goldmember(2002) is must-see lunacy for devoted fans of the shagadelic franchise. Unfortunately, the law of diminishing returns is in full effect: for every big-name cameo and raunchy double-entendre, there's an equal share of redundant shtick, juvenile scatology, and pop-cultural spoofery. All is forgiven when the hilarity level is consistently high, and Mike Myers--returning here as randy Brit spy Austin, his nemesis Dr. Evil, the bloated Scottish henchman Fat Bastard, and new Dutch disco-villain Goldmember--thrives by favoring comedic chaos over coherent plotting. Once they've tossed Austin into the disco fever of 1975 (where he's sent to rescue his father, gamely played by Michael Caine), Myers and director Jay Roach seem vaguely adrift with old and new characters, including Verne Troyer's Mini-Me and pop star Beyonc&#xE9; Knowles as Pam Grier-ish blaxpo-babe Foxxy Cleopatra.

{"description": "Friends' peerless writing staff really spreads the wealth in this pivotal third season. Each of this seamless ensemble's cast members was given a story arc that deepened and enriched their characters. Most devastatingly, Ross (David Schwimmer) and Rachel's (freshly minted Emmy-winner Jennifer Aniston) romance is torn asunder by Ross's jealousy (not to mention his one-night stand while the couple are, now famously, \"on a break\"). Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) is reunited with her half brother (Giovanni Ribisi) and meets a family friend (Terri Garr; inspired casting) who drops a Darth Vader-esque bombshell about Phoebe's parentage. Monica (Courtney Cox) begins the season reeling from her breakup with Richard (Tom Selleck, who reappears in \"The One Where Monica and Richard Are Friends\"), but rebounds with Pete (Jon Favreau fromSwingers), a millionaire (\"He's the perfect guy,\" she states. \"He has everything. Plus he actually has everything\"). Chandler is driven to increasingly hysterical attempts to \"go through the tunnel\" and commit to his relationship with Janice (Maggie Wheeler). And womanizer Joey (Matt LeBlanc) reveals his soulful side when he falls for an initially contemptuous theatrical costar. Also lending memorable support are Alison LaPlaca, as Rachel's self-absorbed new boss, and an Emmy-worthy Ben Stiller (\"The One with the Screamer\") as Rachel's new boyfriend whose volcanic temper only erupts in front of Ross.Friendscontinues its hit-and-miss history with A-list cameos. Robin Williams and Billy Crystal (\"The One with the Ultimate Fighting Champion\") are about as funny as the woeful film they were hyping,Fathers' Day. More memorable is Isabella Rossellini (\"The One with Frank Jr.\"), whom the hapless Ross meets just after crossing her off his \"freebie list\" of celebrities Rachel would allow him to sleep with. Other classic episodes include the season-opener, \"The One with the Princess Leia Fantasy\" and \"The One with the Flashback,\" which offers some provocative near-couplings between Monica and Joey, Ross and Phoebe, and Chandler and Rachel. Add a chick and a duck (\"The One with a Chick, and a Duck\"), and you have a benchmark season in this irreplaceable series.

{"description": "A grainy, enigmatic videotape has the power to kill people seven days after they watch it. This brilliant premise fueled the 2002 Hollywood hitThe Ring, but before that it conquered Japan inRingu, Hideo Nakata's quietly unsettling study in terror. Fans of the U.S. version will find a less elaborate storyline and more primal fear in the original; the basic plot, however, still has a worried reporter (Nanako Matsushima) tracking down the meaning of the video--and, having watched it herself, she has only a week to work.

{"description": "TheIdentityDVD features are not quite as enticing as they sound.  Of chief interest is the extended branched version of the film (available in widescreen only), but there's only one added scene (an interesting but not critical minute-long sequence that would have been the first conference-room scene), and the differences in the alternate ending are so subtle that you'll miss them if you literally blink a few times.  There's no question it could affect audience perception, but unlike most alternate endings, it doesn't affect the actual outcome.  (Seespoilerfor more information.)  The four deleted scenes (which don't include either of the above-mentioned additions) aren't that exciting, and the optional director commentary notes that these deletions generally served to cut moments of character and comic relief in favor of moving the story along, which is one reason the film runs a brisk 90 minutes. James Mangold's director commentary on the feature is good, though, as he discusses such matters as the logistics of the perpetual downpour and a crucial bit of dialogue removed from the film's climax.  Considering that downpour and the contrasting darks and lights of the film, picture quality is good, and the thunder claps sound great in 5.1 sound so there are no complaints about the DVD's presentation of the film itself.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000TJ6PBK", "B00006AUJR", "B0009YA3OA", "B000DZ7YN8", "B00005JNY3", "B00AADAK5W", "1558908382", "B00008K77D", "B0002DB54A", "B000RGN2JI", "B00AEBB8NI", "B000P0I4O4", "B00003CXZ4", "B004ZNFTDQ", "B0015XHQVC", "B00026ZD04", "B00014NEZI", "B003LR5BD0", "B00092ZLSK", "B004SIP92O", "B00000JGHL", "B003VA3JUO", "B00BNH9NCU", "B00DZP1C2W", "B00I45844W", "B004YCKKFK", "B00011CZRE", "B0002234LS", "B001HVZOB6", "B005S9EJ8W", "B000A2UBN4", "B00HOGBXS6", "B000OYC7BW", "B0004Z31OS", "B00AEBB89W", "B00AEFXW8I", "B00009OWJY", "B002NZK5RI", "B00AEFXEGS", "B00007AJF8", "B003ASLJQ8", "B000R4SMCW", "B000069HZP", "B00003CXGA", "B00005V9HH", "B0001FR3IQ", "B00005JPT0", "B000SK5Z20", "B00008YJDK", "B0013D8LBS", "6305238065", "B0021L8UFI", "B004P7CN7W", "078322799X", "B001OQCV2E", "B0002WT4OE", "B00B6OEB18", "B00003CXKM", "B004SIP9RO", "B000RZIGUE", "B004B3PBFQ", "B004LWZW24", "B00AEFXT1S", "B00096S49Y", "B000LC55F2", "0783240295", "B00009L1TA", "B0034G4P30", "B002O3Z4WK", "B00005JLO8", "B001ILFUBE", "B00005JKIS", "B004SIP9MY", "6305718954", "B000ALM40I", "B0001Z52RU", "B0010X73ZG", "B000A5045Q", "B00005JMWP", "B00005JN2Z", "B000F5WR4W", "B0000648X0", "B0021L8UPS", "B00AEBBA2W", "6301971345", "B002UJIY7A", "B0006IIKQW", "B00B96TGQS", "B004BLJQOK", "B00AEFXKZ8", "6304806434", "B001NPD9LS", "B000U1ZV76", "B003L20IEW", "B00596WFE4", "B000GCFO0I", "B00005UQ9W", "B000053UIF", "B0000YTOL2"], "bought_together": ["B000TJ6PBK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000TJ6PBK", "B0012Q7M02", "B00006AUJR", "B00AEBBA2W"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30202}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.73, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00008EY9G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RKTbv5kkL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Identity"}

{"description": "Deep Space Nine's seventh and final season came down to loose ends, tying some existing ones together while allowing others to unravel. Symptomatic of the unwillingness to letDS9go was the immediate arrival of a replacement Dax, though poor Nichole deBoer as Ezri Dax had to have known she'd already missed the boat. Her appearance encouraged last-minute romances to blossom, with Bashir finally getting some action, Odo finally getting together with Kira, and Sisko finally proposing to Kassidy. Another contributing cute factor were numerous trips to the holosuite wherein the all-knowing Vic Fontaine dished out philosophical advice. That was when the crew wasn't in there to play baseball against the Vulcans, or when Nog wasn't commiserating about the loss of a leg.Oh yes, and don't forget the War! There was an early announcement that the show would attempt a 10-part resolution to the Dominion War, but viewers could be forgiven for forgetting all about it with so much sentimental distraction. When the horrors of war did resurface, they at least injected a few surprises into the mix. Odo and his ambiguously \"evil\" Founders were hit with a melting disease, prompting a backstabbing race for the power of developing and owning a cure. The original baddie Cardassians finally settled on the Federation's side. Contrary to these interesting twists, however, were the unexpected turns taken by matters relating to Sisko's spiritual destiny. Suddenly the mystery of the wormhole and an entire religious belief system was reduced to the problem of correctly translating the words of a sacred book. The struggle to join with some evil aliens significantly diluted the attempt at resolving what had begun seven years before in the show's pilot episode. Ultimately, Sisko's destiny, as with all those who'd followed him to the open-ended climax, was to be decided elsewhere. In a move that was either bold and daring--or possibly born of desperation for not having thought things through properly--the show's storylines were to be continued in a series ofspin-off books.--Paul Tonks", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008KA58", "B00008KA59", "B00008KGT0", "B00008KA5A", "B00008972H", "B00005JLF5", "B00062IDCO", "B0002WZTCA", "B00062IDLA", "B0002JP4GE", "B0001NBNFW", "B000127LW2", "B000228EBS", "B000AOEMXC", "B0009I7NGW", "B000A6CLL0", "B0007TKH66", "B00BHWG0CM", "B00BHWG0DQ", "B000063V8T", "B000063V8S", "B000063V8R", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B000062XFG", "B004EXWGHY", "B002BAW6FE", "B00005Y1NF", "B00HETWFVC", "B003H9LIRK", "B002BAW6GS", "B001DHXT3Y", "B00062IDDS", "B000AOEMXM", "B002L9N4E2", "B00000JZ0Z", "B000I0QLRS", "B000CEXFYW", "B00IWTVDUW", "B000I0QLR8", "B000I0QLRI", "B00BHWG0G8", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00IURL19Y", "B002BAW6FY", "B000VDDDY6", "B006LPHY6G", "B0017VG69U", "B00061QJSK", "B000HEWEJ4", "B00BHWG1AI", "B000PHX8RA", "B00B7VZN76", "B000LC4ZI0", "B002BAW6GI", "B002BAW6H2", "B000I0QLQY", "B002HQKRBC", "B000I0QLS2", "B003ZFC9M4", "B00K7IPGS6", "B000092T3Y", "B001RHGRTS", "B00IF0KASY", "B00IO998U2", "B004TJ1H3C", "1451607156", "B001DF681G", "B002GP7ZVO", "B00FFEM0W2", "B00CKYHH6O", "B008R52LA2", "B00ENFS0F0", "B000BCCAEQ", "B000B8IA2G", "B000B5XOTS", "B000BNI90Y", "B002I9Z8GW", "B007AFC0W4", "B001DHXT6G", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00CDEJRDC", "B00CYQXHLC", "B00JPS6A3O", "B000E5KQM8", "B00AMDA2P8", "B002I9Z8GM", "B005GYXO30", "B00CTSDDVO", "B006LG74RE", "B0055OG2BC", "B00GX7D5G0", "B002GP7ZV4", "B0095XPZBC", "B0006FO9B0", "B0000AUHOH", "B000PMFRTC", "B001O0TWY0", "B0048FUUAI", "B00GZP0JSC", "B00000ILBK"], "bought_together": ["B00008KA58", "B00008KA59"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00008KA58", "B00008KGT0", "B00005JLF5", "B00008KA5A"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 20323}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 35.41, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B00008KA57", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515jKg5Op4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek Deep Space Nine - The Complete Seventh Season"}
{"description": "Kate Hudson twinkles as the heroine of How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days. She's a magazine writer assigned to date a guy, make all the mistakes girls make that drive guys away (being clingy, talking in baby-talk and so on) and records the process like a sociological experiment. However, the guy she picks-- Matthew McConaughey--is an advertising executive who's just bet that he can make a woman fall in love with him in 10 days; if he succeeds, he'll win a huge account that will make his career. The set-up is completely absurd, but the collision of their efforts to woo and repel creates some pretty funny scenes. McConaughey's easy charm and Hudson's lightweight impishness play well together and the plot, though strictly Hollywood formula, chugs along efficiently. At moments Hudson seems to channel her mother, Goldie Hawn, to slightly unnerving effect. --Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00007E2F5", "B00003CXSM", "B00AEFXWXI", "B0012KJ0DK", "B002K0WBXW", "B0015I2RT8", "B00164KYV4", "B004EPZ070", "B0000897EG", "B00447L4KA", "B002P413IC", "B00005JN3W", "B002ZG988M", "B000MQC9H4", "B002ZG989G", "B00AEBB8NS", "B000A343RI", "B001TUZD8O", "B00006ZXSL", "B00005O5CM", "B001OQCUZM", "B004EPZ0BG", "B00081U7HC", "B004SIP9X8", "B003Y5H574", "B001Y8DJVE", "6304765266", "B00008NRI7", "B000YDBPAM", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00AEBB8R4", "B00AEFYQE2", "B000683VI4", "B0000524E5", "B00AEBB9WI", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B00AEFYM2S", "B000YAA68C", "B00AMEZDJW", "B0007PLLBU", "B00006ZXSK", "B002ZG984Q", "B0009OL7Z4", "B002ZG9968", "B0036TGSIK", "B000023VTP", "B003BV8ICC", "B00AEFYWQY", "B00AEBB8YW", "B000J4QW7W", "B003B3V0N4", "B00005JG6N", "B0000DIXDR", "B004SEUJK0", "B005LAIGSM", "B000ELJAEM", "B0001Z3TXE", "B000957O82", "B001OQCUYI", "B004SIP9RO", "B004SIP8LG", "B003NHRIVQ", "B0013D8LHC", "B00AKGG6JS", "B00008WJD6", "B003Y5H524", "B000J103OI", "B0050MB584", "B00006ZXSO", "B00006FMUW", "B000HEWEE4", "6305236569", "B000XJD33O", "B002ZG99UE", "B0035Q637K", "B00466HN7M", "B001L9EXTS", "B00386EZKE", "B001C5LLQ4", "076780421X", "B000J3OTSM", "B000E6EHE0", "B004LWZW9C", "B00005JM55", "B000EMGICS", "B000CEV3KU", "B008JFUUIA", "B00003CXMP", "B000P0J0DS", "B000TZJBPQ", "B0000AOV4I", "B005Z9MFRC", "B0000D8L1K", "B000HCPS94", "B00E8RKHWW", "B00AEFY4CG", "B004SIP8JI", "B0001AVZA8", "B005LAIGXW", "B000Y7U93C"], "bought_together": ["B00007E2F5", "B002K0WBXW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002K0WBXW", "B002ZG989G", "B00007E2F5", "B00447L4KA"]}, "price": 14.16, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 346003}, "asin": "B00008KDGZ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512083xZEbL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"}
{"description": "Matrixwriter-directors Larry and Andy Wachowski commissioned seven  artists from Japan, America and Korea to make nine short films set in the  world of theirfeature trilogy. Some of the top anime directors contributed  to this anthology, including Yoshiaki Kawajiri (Ninja Scroll), Koji  Morimoto (Robot Carnival), and  Shinchiro Watanabe (Cowboy  Bebop). Some of the films tie directly into the narrative of the live-action movies. Drawn in a style reminiscent of Jean \"Moebius\" Giraud, Mahiro  Maeda'sThe Second Renaissance(Part I & Part II) depicts the  human-machine wars that caused the enslavement of humanity and the creation  of the Matrix. The duel between two flamboyantly costumed Kabuki warriors in  Kawajiri'sProgramis an expanded version of the cybernetic training  Neo (Keanu Reeves) undergoes in the firstMatrixfilm. Watanabe evokes  the look of old newspaper photographs inA Detective Story,which  falls outside the storyline of the features. Fast-paced, violent and grim,The Animatrixis an uneven but intriguing compilation that represents  a new level in the ongoing cross-pollination between Japanese animation and  American live action.

{"description": "The Brady Bunch MovieThe big-screen version of the hugely popular 1970s television sitcom takes an original angle: instead of simply re-creating the old series, the film spoofs it by presenting the merged family as blithely unaware that fashions and customs have changed in the '90s. Shelley Long and Gary Cole are hilarious as the ultra-square yet libidinous Mr. and Mrs. Brady, Christopher Daniel Barnes is an ideal Greg, and Christine Taylor seems practically cloned from the original Marcia. But director Betty Thomas (Private Parts) shifts the emphasis away from comparisons between old and new Bradys and concentrates on quasi-surreal parodies and set pieces featuring the Brady kids doing their spirited, singing thing for a disbelieving public. Smart, sharp, and happy to share its conspiratorial mood with an appreciative audience,The Brady Bunch Movieis a kick.A Very Brady SequelThis second ironic send-up of the old Sherwood Schwartz sitcom is even funnier thanThe Brady Bunch Movie. Shelley Long and Gary Cole return as the married heads of the merged family known as the Bradys, and Christopher Daniel Barnes and Christine Taylor reprise their roles as eldest stepsiblings Greg and Marcia. As with the first film, the clever premise finds the Brady clan caught in a kind of '70s time warp, while the rest of the world has moved well into the '90s. Greg is still looking for a \"groovy girlfriend,\" Mr. Brady thinks the idea of a cable that sends 50 channels to one's TV set must be a joke, and Mrs. Brady spends hours at the beauty shop only to look exactly the same as she went in. There's a plot involving an imposter (Tim Matheson) who claims to be Carol's long-lost husband, but the real charge in this comedy comes from the way these pseudohip characters deal with sexual taboos (is there any real reason that Greg and Marcia shouldn't get it on?) and the incredulous reactions of other people.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00AEFXKIK", "B00AEBB98W", "B004IK30RI", "B000CCBCHQ", "B0001EQICE", "B000MGBSEY", "B0001EQIBU", "B005M2A4CA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFXKIK", "B00AEBB98W", "B004IK30RI", "B000CCBCHQ"]}, "price": 5.97, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 167919}, "asin": "B00008Z45F", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JJHFVWAZL._SX300_.jpg", "title": "The Brady Bunch Movie / A Very Brady Sequel"}
{"description": "The bleak reality of drug addiction is captured with unflinching authenticity inThe Corner, an excellent, reality-based HBO miniseries. Having lived on the streets of West Baltimore, Maryland, where this compelling drama takes place, actor-director Charles S. Dutton knows the territory, physically, socially, and emotionally, and his compassionate approach is vital to the series' success. Dutton cares for his characters deeply enough to give them a realistic shred of hope, even when hope is consistently dashed by the ravages of addiction. This is, at its root, a family tragedy, focusing on errant father Gary (T.K. Carter, in a heartbreaking performance) a once-successful investor trapped in a tailspin of heroin dependency. His estranged wife Fran (Khandi Alexander) was the first to get hooked, and she's struggling to get clean, while their 15-year-old son DeAndre (Sean Nelson, from the indie hitFresh) deals drugs, temporarily avoiding their deadly allure while facing the challenge of premature fatherhood.Through revealing flashbacks and numerous local characters, we see the explicit fallout of addiction, and while violence occasionally erupts, its constant threat is secondary to Dutton's dramatic vision, which remains steadfastly alert to the humanity and neglected potential of these lost and searching souls.The Corneris, essentially, the civilian flipside of HBO's equally laudable seriesThe Wire, which approaches a similar neighborhood from a police-squad perspective. Performances are uniformly superb, details are uncannily perfect, and for all of its human horror,The Corneris riveting, not depressing. A closing interview with the characters' real-life counterparts bears witness to the fact that these lives--with inevitable exceptions--need not be lost forever.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00316DDYA", "B005NFJAWG", "0767900316", "B000QXDJLI", "B00123BY6S", "0802144993", "0805080759", "B0002ERXC2", "B0006IUD9Y", "B000FTCLSU", "B002BLNGTS", "B00005U156", "B00005Y6YJ", "B00000FBH2", "B0000Y40PW", "B000G6BL42", "B002AMUDK8", "B00005B8UA", "B00031TYBC", "B00008PHCZ", "B000G1R4TS", "1558908390", "B00000JGHV", "B00005RDAO", "B0009GV9E6", "0812698231", "B0009S4IGA", "B0006H32DO", "B009LDD3RO", "B004SIP93S", "B00007AJG1", "B00AEFYE08", "6305505780", "6305428409", "B00005ASOO", "B001AQO3WY", "B003UD7JA8", "0446195197", "B00007AJG2", "B0006IIOHC", "B004UXVFIO", "0826438040", "B0006FYOX8", "B007VI5AQ8", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00003W8NT", "B000BITV9W", "B00008MTYF", "B00FRKKVL6", "B000UO4F7U", "B001IFZL50", "B00E1LQEFE", "B000P0J0CE", "B001F0TM62", "B00GO4RGWQ", "B0041QSZS8", "B00005JLG1", "B00066FAQW", "B002CPMB9O", "B006VRRGQW", "039548829X", "B000YDMPBA", "B000E40QC4", "B00AEFYG3S", "B0000TWMT8", "B00I0CAVV8", "B001DJLD12", "B00DW5IL2E", "B00021R7E4", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B0000JBUHI", "B003HKN534", "B000J10F8C", "B000JRYOPG", "B00005Y1UV", "B00GOZ3GOC", "B000CCBCLW", "B000YDOOT6", "B0014FAIV6", "B000TGJ8EY", "B00009AV85", "B00CYQXD2K", "B00014K5KU", "B000JBXHZA", "B000E5KUJW", "0792838076", "B00HUCF420", "B00JPNU8P0", "0743497325", "B000KG4BD6", "B00007BK2T", "B00003CXOP", "B00DJYJRHG", "B006X08FGW", "B002CA68N4", "0767811070", "B000A2XAQ4", "B00J5LXT44", "B004LY8QCK", "B007HOQ5FQ"], "bought_together": ["B00316DDYA", "B005NFJAWG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005NFJAWG", "0767900316", "0805080759", "B00123BY6S"]}, "price": 26.5, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 144949}, "asin": "B00009ATJZ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ndt1KUlVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Corner"}
{"description": "\"Matters of Honor\" launchedBabylon 5's third season with the introduction of theWhite Star, a spacecraft added to enable more of the action to take place away from the station. Also introduced was Marcus Cole (Jason Carter)--in another nod toThe Lord of the Rings, a Ranger not so far removed from Tolkien's Strider. In \"Voices of Authority\" the show finds an epic scale as Ivanova seeks the mysterious \"First Ones\" for allies against the Shadows, and evidence is discovered pointing to the truth behind President Santiago's assassination. A third of the way through the season \"Messages from Earth,\" \"Point of No Return,\" and \"Severed Dreams\" prove pivotal, changing the nature of the story in a way previously unimaginable on network TV. Earth slides into dictatorship, the fascistic Nightwatch takes control of off-world security, and Sheridan take decisive action by declaring Babylon 5 independent.\"Interludes and Examinations\" presented the death of a major supporting character, while the two-part \"War Without End\" reached apocalyptic dimensions in a complex tale resolving the destiny of Sinclair and the fate ofBabylon 4(dovetailing elegantly with the events of thefirst season's \"Babylon Squared\"), resolving a 1,000-year-old paradox and presenting a vision of a very dark future for Sheridan and Delenn. All this was trumped by the monumental \"Z'ha'dum.\" In the preceding \"Shadow Dancing\" Anna Sheridan (Melissa Gilbert, Bruce Boxleitner's real-life wife) returned from the dead, no longer entirely human. In the mythologically resonant climax Anna invited Sheridan back to the Shadow homeworld with no hope of survival. Just as inThe Lord of the RingsGandalf fell into the abyss at Khazad-Dum, so Sheridan took a comparable leap into the unknown on an alien world.--Gary S.

{"description": "Marking an assured directorial debut for actor John Malkovich,The Dancer Upstairsis a tense, nerve-jangling political thriller that values adult storytelling and emotional depth over cheap thrills. It's a challenge for those accustomed to the frantic pace of Hollywood thrillers, but attentive viewers will be richly rewarded by Malkovich's slow-burn approach to the film's terrorist plot, adapted by Nicholas Shakespeare from his ownnovel, based on the \"Shining Path\" movement that terrorized Peru in the 1980s. The plot unfolds in an unnamed Latin American capital, where a lawyer-turned-police detective named Rejas (Javier Bardem) leads an investigation to locate Ezequiel, a terrorist whose followers have left a trail of fear, death and destruction across the city. Rejas falls in love with his daughter's ballet teacher (Laura Morante), but the film's ultimate revelation--a coincidence that Malkovich handles with credible delicacy--throws this simmering drama into stark relief, bringing Bardem's character (and his subtle performance) to a greater awareness of his own personal and political humanity.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0011FLH14", "B00116GEJ8", "B00003CXRG", "B00080Z53O", "B0041KKYF6", "B001DN0UY4", "B0036TGSJE", "B004MOJW0E", "B001DJ7PR8", "B000K2V7F0", "B008YYSD3U", "B000088UZ4", "B00005LZOD", "B000N3T0DW", "B00AZMFKXK", "B000GUJYH4", "0385721072", "B0001DCYMI", "B00005N8A9", "B00005JLQW", "B00008AOX5", "B003Z8ZC2A", "B009B8YMB0", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005JNCZ", "B00001ODHV", "B004XVMCMG", "B000CCD1RA", "B002VECLXC", "B0007NBJHI", "B00005JL57", "B000274TLW", "B002FHGESI", "B008FYZHHE", "B0002TT0MI", "B00018D40O", "B0006Z2NKO", "B001UV4XRY", "B000PISZ7W", "B004AE3QYE", "B00000F7E6", "B00006G8G3", "B00000K3TU", "B000F7CMRM", "0140157654", "B0007OCG5G", "B000C3L2PC", "B00HRISNPM", "B004YCKKH8", "B00008L3S6", "B006DHATE6", "B0030Y1282", "B002SF9YNY", "B003Z8ZC0M", "B002I5GNZQ", "B00006L91I", "B000J3OTOG", "B0000A2ZTY", "B008XAT0U0", "B00004Z1FK", "B00HEEAMCG", "B000Y54UUC", "B000N6TX1I", "B002T4GXUG", "B002DU39GW", "B001LRJH0U", "B0081HLM2E", "B0013XZ2QK", "B002LVVCJY", "B00AQBDU4Q", "B002ZG993Q", "B00005JL6M", "B001WLMOL4", "B008FYZJ2C", "B0000AMU29", "B0016LFG3S", "B004ZJZQ92", "B00AEFXRWO", "B00AEFY8MM", "B001FB5634", "B0000TPAH4", "B002EOVWVQ", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B000E5KURY", "B002M2T1VI", "B005CFBZ3O", "B000O76ZQC", "B0043X1FNQ", "B00GPPXNIK", "B000CCW2O8", "B001N44BVQ", "B004CIIXDC", "B00008L3TF", "B001URA5Y8", "B00003CXXY", "B0016MJ6HY", "B000G0O5IM", "B004SIP6BI", "B000QGE84M"], "bought_together": ["B0011FLH14"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0011FLH14", "B00003CXRG", "B004XVMCMG", "B001DJ7PR8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 85585}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.79, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B0000AGQ5V", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4173C4VBCSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Dancer Upstairs"}

{"description": "As the 2005 theatrical release ofSerenitymade clear,Fireflywas a science fiction concept that deserved a second chance. Devoted fans (or \"Browncoats\") knew it all along, and with this well-packaged DVD set, those who missed the show's original broadcasts can see what they missed. Creator Joss Whedon's ambitious science-fiction Western (Whedon's third series afterBuffy the Vampire SlayerandAngel) was canceled after only 11 of these 14 episodes had aired on the Fox network, but history has proven that its demise was woefully premature. Whedon's generic hybrid got off to a shaky start when network executives demanded an action-packed one-hour premiere (\"The Train Job\"); in hindsight the intended two-hour pilot (also titled \"Serenity,\" and oddly enough, the final episode aired) provides a better introduction to the show's concept and splendid ensemble cast. Obsessive fans can debate the quirky logic of combining spaceships with direct parallels to frontier America (it's 500 years in the future, and embattled humankind has expanded into the galaxy, where undeveloped \"outer rim\" planets struggle with the equivalent of Old West accommodations), but Whedon and his gifted co-writers and directors make it work, at least well enough to fashion a credible context from the incongruous culture-clashing of past, present, and future technologies, along with a polyglot language (the result of two dominant superpowers) that combines English with an abundance of Chinese slang.What makes it work is Whedon's delightfully well-chosen cast and their nine well-developed characters--a typically Whedon-esque extended family--each providing a unique perspective on their adventures aboard Serenity, the junky but beloved \"Firefly-class\" starship they call home. As a veteran of the disadvantaged Independent faction's war against the all-powerful planetary Alliance (think of it as Underdogs vs. Overlords), Serenity captain Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) leads his compact crew on a quest for survival. They're renegades with an amoral agenda, taking any job that pays well, butFirefly'scomplex tapestry of right and wrong (and peace vs. violence) is richer and deeper than it first appears. Tantalizing clues about Blue Sun (an insidious mega-corporation with a mysteriously evil agenda), its ties to the Alliance, and the traumatizing use of Serenity's resident stowaway (Summer Glau) as a guinea pig in the development of advanced warfare were clear indicationsFireflywas heading for exciting revelations that were precluded by the series' cancellation. Fortunately, the big-screenSerenity(which can be enjoyed independently of the series) ensured that Whedon's wild extraterrestrial west had not seen its final sunset. Its very existence confirms that these 14 episodes (and enjoyable bonus features) will endure as irrefutable proof Fox made a glaring mistake in canceling the series. --Jeff ShannonBeyondFireflyon DVDWatchStargate: Continuumon DVDCatch up onStargate Atlantison DVDCheck outSunshineon DVDStills fromFirefly(Click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BW7QWW", "B001M5UDGS", "B001KOFH2G", "B00E688AZE", "1593074492", "B002JVWR4U", "B0024FAR66", "B0006FO9B0", "1781161682", "B000AJJNFE", "1595821627", "1595825614", "B0000844I8", "B006URR9HY", "B0036EH3UC", "B002GP7ZWI", "1845760824", "B00061QJSK", "B000VY1EYG", "B000EHSVN2", "B00AZMFJYA", "B000BOH8Y6", "B000BLI4PQ", "B00FR23QNE", "B0081QF6Q8", "B00GT2TEPU", "B00KHWSB5M", "B000EHSVMS", "B004YPED14", "B0009JE6G6", "B004D92S9K", "B000FOPPBA", "B000EHSVLY", "B0090SI56Y", "B003PGNBO8", "B000EHSVM8", "B00ECR7KX2", "B001MT7ZEW", "B000F8O2PQ", "B000BNI90Y", "B002ZHKZGA", "B00FSKOFKS", "B002I9Z8I0", "B00129W6LE", "B0038M2APA", "B001AQO43M", "B00BM2JVAA", "B002GY9F9K", "B000QXDCJ2", "B0007CEXUY", "B001CQONMC", "B000RZIGVS", "B007D5E7C2", "B008YOLRDS", "B001XRLWPQ", "B00F3M3VSS", "B000SMNL92", "B008JFUPFI", "B000I0RQVI", "B004EPYZPS", "B001YYQA0K", "B005PPMHO2", "B0089AD8IO", "B000U7WV1Y", "B000B8IA2G", "B00E3QJ7JC", "B00COMH99W", "B004SMDJ9U", "B008H1Q61G", "B000BCCAEQ", "B000T9OP7G", "B005LAIH2W", "B0032UYFA6", "B006TBYC76", "B003F3NDWG", "B004H85K1K", "B0041T52S6", "B000LC4ZI0", "B008JFUNHI", "0062225758", "B004L9GMBC", "B0046XG48O", "B00DII0MGI", "B006TTC5WC", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B000QDLSR0", "B004EPYZU8", "B0016Q0HY6", "B001DJLCRC", "B003L77FYS", "B000U1ZV8K", "B00E8RKHWW", "0786891424", "B00J2MPZQG", "0792844890", "B00JAD6BYW", "B007ZXW3SM", "B00IXD2MGQ", "0786891432"], "bought_together": ["B000BW7QWW", "B001M5UDGS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BW7QWW", "B005S9EK5Y", "B001M5UDGS", "B004LWZW42"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 918}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 12.99, "brand": "20TH Century Fox", "asin": "B0000AQS0F", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q-uS67cjL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Firefly: The Complete Series"}

{"description": "Spanning two decades and countless light years of interstellar adventure,Star Trek: The Motion Pictures Collectionis a testament to the enduring goodwill of Gene Roddenberry's optimistic sci-fi concept. Long beforeStar Warssparked an explosion of big-screen science fiction, Roddenberry had planned a secondStar TrekTV series; the project fizzled, but its pilot script evolved into the first film in Paramount's most lucrative movie franchise. Despite its sluggish pace and bland \"pajama\" costuming,Star Trek: The Motion Picture(1979) offered a welcomed reunion of the \"ClassicTrek\" cast, packed with Douglas Trumbull's still-dazzling special effects. Trekkers were even more ecstatic whenThe Wrath of Khan(1982) revived the spirit of the original series, even though director Nicholas Meyer was aTrekneophyte. With Leonard Nimoy directing,The Search for Spock(1984) began whereKhanleft off, with a thrilling (albeit contrived) obligation to resurrect the formerly ill-fated Mr. Spock.A box-office smash, Nimoy'sThe Voyage Home(1986)  is the franchise's most accessible adventure--a high point offset by William Shatner's comparatively dreadfulStar Trek V: The Final Frontier(1989). Meyer (and his penchant for quoting Shakespeare) returned forThe Undiscovered Country(1991), a conspiracy thriller that put the series back on track, inspiring fans to invoke the \"even number\" rule in rating their franchise favorites.Generations(1994) gracefully passed the torch to TV'sThe Next Generation, bidding farewell to Captain Kirk with honor and integrity intact. Highlighted by the evolving humanity of Brent Spiner's android Lt. Cmdr. Data,First Contact(1996) exploredStar Trekhistory with a logical (hint) surprise encounter, andInsurrection(1998) provided an adequate expansion of the successfulNextGenseries. Taken as a whole, these ten films demonstrate the consistent vitality of Roddenberry's original vision, stoking any Trekker's appetite for \"ongoing missions\" inNemesisand beyond.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002HWRYJE", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001DHXT6G", "B000AOEMXM", "B000HEWEJ4", "B000RZIGVS", "B00062RCC6", "B001DHXT3Y", "B00062IDDS", "B008JFUS0U", "1613778953", "B00000ILDH", "B002GSXKN8", "B000VDDDY6", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B008JFUNHI", "B00005JKHP", "B00CTSDDVO", "B00F3L8P26", "B00JL6L4WC", "B001E75QH0", "B002945DU2", "B00BTYMPUY", "B000P6XQ50", "B0077T5SWC", "B002I9Z8I0", "6305181721", "B0017VG69U", "B002EL4RLQ", "B0000UJL96", "B001TH16CE", "B0001O3YA8", "6305428263", "B00BEZTMFY", "B000E6ESEY", "B000H6SXW4", "B005BUA1JY", "B000286RR0", "B002MU4NM2", "B00E5G03I4", "B00GX7D5G0", "B001DJLD1M", "B005SH62X4", "B002PQ7JQK", "B002A6FIXG", "B001CQONOA", "B008JFUPFI", "B00DYEN6XC", "B00061QJSK", "B009WH5KC0", "B009LDD4V4", "B000VXWK86", "B000WC3864", "B001TH16CO", "B000REQQGQ", "B000063V8R", "B002I9Z8GM", "B000M341R8", "B000ASDFH2", "B002U0KHME", "B000CEXFYW", "B005J9ZFQG", "B008JFUO72", "B004XM38CS", "B00BMJ7ZKG", "B00A3717C0", "B0054OGQM8", "B005BYBZKY", "B00006BH8G", "B00HERGM86", "B000BW7QWW", "B002I9Z8EO", "B0083SBMBM", "B00005Y1NF", "B006U1JD5G", "B007ZFR67I", "B00471JSRE", "B001XW7ICW", "B00A8MGIZG", "B008JFUQZ2", "B000JLTRHW", "B000PHX8RA", "B008412UQ4", "B0000AQS0F", "B00C6ACVD6", "B00EC9UHVM", "B00D2D1WVI", "B00DY9528Y", "B008HUSFTS", "B000U1ZV62", "B008DVJNTW", "B000P0J0A6", "B00DJYJWVW", "B007REV4T8", "B008JFURII", "B001EXE2Y2", "B001TH16DS", "B007KFZ85K", "B002HRF68A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002I9Z8I0", "B002I9Z8GM", "B001DHXT6G", "B00AZMFJYA"]}, "price": 69.5, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 227123}, "asin": "B0000CABK8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K147X2XGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek - The Motion Pictures Collection (10 Films)"}

{"description": "Even under the heavy censorship of 1946 Hollywood, Lana Turner and John Garfield's libidinous desires burn up the screen in Tay Garnett's adaptation of James M. Cain's torrid crime melodrama. Platinum blond Turner is Cora, a restless sexpot stuck in a roadside diner married to mundane middle-aged fry cook Nick Smith (Cecil Kellaway) when handsome drifter Frank (Garfield) blows her way. It's lust at first sight, a rapacious desire that neither can break off, and before long they're plotting his demise--but in the wicked world of Cain nothing is that easy. Garnett's visual approach is subdued compared to the more expressionistic film noir of the period, but he's at no loss when he films the luminous Turner in her milky-white wardrobe. She radiates repressed sexuality and uncontrollable passion while Garfield's smart-talking loner Frank mixes street-smart swagger and scrappy toughness with vulnerability and sincere intensity. Costar Hume Cronyn cuts a cold, calculating figure as their conniving lawyer, a chilly character that only increases our feelings for the murderous couple, victims of an all consumingamour fouthat drives their passions to extremes.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001KXZGNW", "B001KXZGOG", "B002GSXKPQ", "B0087ZG7OI", "B002GSXKQA", "B007FQXEVY", "B001KXZGO6", "079073219X", "B003UN2IAY", "B008D1Q1VU", "B008D1R52Y", "B005F265CU", "B005EVY8MQ", "B007FQXEQO", "B008D1R52E", "B00004XPPK", "B000FFJYAW", "B002VWNIAY", "B001D8W7EK", "B003UN2I4K", "B0047BXQZY", "B0045HCJ9E", "B0008ENIAC", "B0049985XW", "B00871C09S", "B004H83IFU", "B00406UJZG", "B00AEBB97S", "B006H37PXY", "B0080JG2GE", "B00023P4GA", "B00AEFXD1O", "B000BQ5IXW", "B00AEBBA7W", "B0001HAGTW", "B008D1Q1TM", "B000FFJYAC", "B000244EYW", "B00007ELD1", "B0045HCJHG", "B001D8W7EU", "B00AEBB89C", "B00AEFXRWO", "B004UOHNCA", "B00005A0QS", "B00DNQM7N6", "B00023P4II", "B000CC1TNI", "B000FFJYAM", "B002945DUW", "B000ECX0O2", "B0087ZG7R0", "B005H8G78O", "B003B3V0RA", "B000087F79", "B0086IMNRQ", "B001PO54V0", "B004XKVP7K", "B000244EWO", "B000B8384Q", "B0024FAG80", "B00006RCO1", "B000025RE7", "B006H37P2K", "B0007ZEO8C", "B00466JALY", "B000FFJYA2", "B00004W229", "B00DBE97S8", "B0050FXDDQ", "B00005RDRL", "B00027JYLM", "B00AMSQBNK", "B008BSM1XC", "B00008LDNZ", "B000CNE088", "B004UOHNAC", "B0006HBV3C", "B00553K8DQ", "B00005JKF6", "B00AEFXN9G", "B0008ENID4", "B00023P4FQ", "B0035Q636Q", "B000PKG7CU", "B0000549B0", "B00003CXBU", "B0047BXR1C", "B00012L786", "B006FE83UE", "B00006RCO2", "B00BQ412GU", "B001PO550A", "B000244F2S", "B000EXDSBQ", "B000PMFRVU", "B00AATGDW0", "B0006HBV28", "B003ZEQMH8", "B0006Z2NE0"], "bought_together": ["B001KXZGNW", "B001KXZGOG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001KXZGNW", "B003ZEQMH8", "B008D1Q1VU", "B005F265CU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 36043}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0000EYUCU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CHTNvd9UL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Postman Always Rings Twice"}

{"description": "The passion of oral surgeons is the unlikely subject ofThe Secret Lives of Dentists, Alan Rudolph's keenly observed comedy-drama. Campbell Scott and Hope Davis, dentists both, have three kids and a pleasant life. Pleasant, but not exciting. When Scott realizes his wife is having an affair on the side, he's torn between caution and an outrageous inner voice urging drastic action. That voice is personified by Denis Leary, who pops up with unwelcome advice, like a nattering ghost; needless to say, the role is a perfect fit for Leary's hostile persona. The blend of everyday realities--especially a hilariously miserable five-day siege with stomach flu--and Leary's surreal presence makes for a typically offbeat Rudolph offering. The smart script, after a Jane Smiley story, is by Craig Lucas. Indie stalwarts Scott and Davis both do subtle work--they're as careful and scrupulous as the dentists they portray.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JLX8", "B001FRNB9E", "B000N9CM7W", "B0043SL1FI", "B000VY1F1S", "B005CFBZXO", "B0007P0XAK", "B00006CXH1", "B0000714E7", "B0007989KW", "B002OVB9VW", "B000BZN1OQ", "B0045NXMJE", "B00003CXQ4", "B0002XNT12", "B00366BBTO", "B001FFBI6Y", "B00004WI57", "6305223122", "B00BLN4UDS", "B00004STRF", "6305922675", "B00005RDRT", "B0009ETCR4", "B00004Z1F8"], "bought_together": ["B000N9CM7W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007P0XAK", "B000E3L7E6", "B001FRNB9E", "B00008HC9B"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 210346}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.54, "brand": "", "asin": "B0000X2EJ2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5176H3SF88L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Secret Lives Of Dentists"}
{"description": "A volatile men-in-prison soap opera, fueled by testosterone and lubricated by blood, HBO'sOzis addictive viewing. The third season of the most violent show on cable TV, set in a cage of concrete and steel and glass, opens with echoes of violence past. Miguel Alvarez (Kirk Acevedo) is in solitary confinement for brutally blinding a guard, one-time drug lord Simon Adebissi (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) mourns for his murdered father, and Tobias Beecher (Lee Tergesen) nurses bones broken by Aryan Brotherhood leader Schillinger (J.K. Simmons) and a heart broken by the betrayal of Keller (Law and Order: SVU's Christopher Meloni). Their stories of vengeance, redemption, and forgiveness anchor this season.The show races through each episode with a driving pace that only intensifies the ferocity. But for all the show's physical brutality, the most affecting violence is emotional, from the strange and savage love affair between Beecher and Keller to the escalating war of terror between Beecher and Schillinger. On a lighter note, this season marks the debut of both Miss Sally and new prison CO Sean Murphy (Robert Clohessy), whose understated strength is too often overlooked in the face of the show's more explosive personalities.

{"description": "The slippery protagonist ofThe Talented Mr. Ripleyreturns in another deadly guise inRipley's Game, a well-appointed star vehicle. The star this time is John Malkovich, whose older Tom Ripley has settled into an Italian villa and a life of aesthetic contemplation (a little like Hannibal Lecter inHannibal). A former partner (Ray Winstone) drags an innocent frame-maker (Dougray Scott), dying of leukemia, into the role of unexpected hit man. Ripley, for his own enigmatic reasons, helps. Liliana Cavani, ofThe Night Porternotoriety, directed this handsome if nebulous film (which has no connection to theMatt Damon picture, other than a Patricia Highsmithsource novel). Malkovich exudes his usual oily disenchantment with the world; Lena Headey, like the location footage, is gorgeous.

{"description": "The life of an English schoolmaster may sound like dry stuff, butTo  Serve Them All My Daysfinds engrossing drama and dry wit in the most  ordinary of circumstances. David Powlett-Jones (John Duttine), a young  Welshman, returns from the trenches of World War I disillusioned and suffering  from shellshock. Accepted as a teacher at an elite boy's boarding school  called Bamfylde, Powlett-Jones fears he won't last--but the faith of the  headmaster who hired him (Frank Middlemass) proves well-founded.  Powlett-Jones immediately flies in the face of convention, fighting with a  pompous science teacher (Neil Stacy), speaking out in favor of socialist  reforms, and finding a mixture of discipline and empathy with the boys he  teaches. Over the course of his 20-year rise through the ranks of  Bamfylde, he finds and loses love with several women (Belinda Lang, Kim  Braden, and Susan Jameson); one of the greatest strengths ofTo Serve  Them All My Daysis how fully realized these women are, each  strikingly individual and self-directed.The writing and acting are  impeccable, always cutting to the most engaging aspect of every scene, yet  grounding every conflict in a rich understanding of character and  circumstance. Even the minor characters are made vivid and distinct, and  the realities of life--politics, sex, mortality--are handled frankly and  honestly. In fact,To Serve Them All My Daysdemonstrates the best  aspects of a miniseries, taking the scope of 13 episodes to map in  detail a human life, with all its victories and disasters. Truly a  pleasure to watch; of particular note is Alan MacNaughtan as a sardonic  fellow teacher, whose ironic observations and close friendship with  Powlett-Jones give the series a good dose of both humor and compassion. Based on the classic novel by R.F. Delderfield.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007LFPJ8", "B009L2EW5W", "B00DW5ILF6", "B00KCA32XK", "B008UQUS26", "B00BQXTDIU", "B00065GX96", "B00006HAZH", "B00007149J", "1402218249", "B0013NAMLK", "B00HUAH14Q", "B004JMSIQS", "B004JMSIVI", "B005X5XIMO", "B0002S648C", "B00EKFI1HA", "B004H0ZHD4", "B00JJRLFTU", "B000V1OUPE", "B007A2O3FO", "B00005JOA0", "B0054DPLHK", "B00A8KJMP6", "1402218214", "B00BCXW106", "B00F1BFRA6", "B00EF0NVGQ", "B00HUAGZ34", "1402218222", "B00H4ZEFTQ", "B0077PBPVE", "B00GD7UO4G", "B00GAXASK8", "B000A8AXXG", "B005T0OY5S", "B00BIR2A3E", "B001B3LIPG", "B00FPPQYXM", "B005GP7ELW", "B0077PBPJ6", "B003CP1T50", "B000EBD9VC", "B000PFUA7S", "B00C888LOO", "B0013NAML0", "B009DS6YGO", "B001AXL67W", "B00GWXI20E", "B0093I913W", "B00E3UN66I", "B000784WNQ", "B00D49YEHO", "B00HHYF55C", "B003YCI1UC", "B000EDWLSW", "B000M2E32M", "B00ANGICCO", "B00HHYF5DE", "B00062IZ0Y", "B001B1Q2UO", "B0083HXKMC", "B00BBXSP84", "B000FL7CBY", "B00IBKXP8A", "B000BKDNX0", "B00B62R9XM", "B00008DDRZ", "B0080QOL10", "B004FM2EL2", "B000EMGF2Q", "B0090XUARQ", "B003WEAW18", "B004N66XYE", "B001D7T6N6", "B00065GVIO", "B00005YUNK", "B00023BKO0", "B001JXPC8C", "B001PU8N0I", "B000G6BM0K", "B001HZ4K80", "B00D7AM2WO", "B005N8KP3Q", "B000PC6YUI", "B001HCWGUW", "B000GIXLUC", "B0002XVS6A", "B00BCXVYOK", "B009YX8MKO", "B000GAKFI6", "B00A8KJLPM", "B007701RFS", "B00GD7UO6E", "B00GWXI1F0", "B000AYELAG", "B00BBXRKHQ", "B004EYT8BA", "B000BKDO6Q"], "bought_together": ["B0007LFPJ8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00F1BFRA6", "B00DW5ILF6", "1402218249", "B0013NAMLK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 30916}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 42.49, "brand": "Acorn Media", "asin": "B00018WENM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5186GKFQTVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "To Serve Them All My Days"}

{"description": "This two-disc set certainly improves upon the fluffyReloadedDVD release. Although there's still no Wachowski brothers talking about their creation, there's a lot of good stuff here in the three main segments. We are constantly reminded how long the back-to-back filming schedule was, and it's most interesting to hear from the actors and artists as they come to the end of this long road. When a white rabbit flashes on screen, you can \"branch\" the most interesting documentary footage: how \"bullet time\" is being recalibrated and how you go about replicating so many Agent Smiths. A timeline is wonderfully put together, but cumbersome to navigate through. The extras certainly illustrate how the movie did not deserve to be passed over for a few technical Oscar nominations.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000AXE8I", "B000P0J0AQ", "B00008LDPU", "B001TK80C0", "B00005N5S5", "B001VLBDD0", "B000AYELVA", "B004LWZW42", "B004LWZWGA", "B001FB55HQ", "B001HN697M", "B000EGDB10", "B0002J4X1Q", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00005JN0T", "B00005JNJV", "B003Y5H5EW", "B001GKJ2E8", "B005LAIHXQ", "B000UR9T8C", "B000VWYJ86", "B009MO57H6", "B00005JMEW", "B00005JMUA", "B00003CWT6", "B001DHXT20", "B00005JKZV", "B00005JKCH", "B000HCO83Q", "B000U7WV1Y", "B000099635", "B0000VAFO0", "B000HRMAPE", "B001DJLD1M", "B008JFUS0U", "B000VR0570", "B005LAIGW8", "B001GZ6QC4", "B005G4TJUC", "B000QXDED6", "B000P0J06K", "B0087ZG7NO", "B00005JLXH", "B004LWZWFQ", "B00003CXTA", "B00IKM5LXG", "B00005JKWJ", "B002ZG98UA", "B0002KVUKM", "B00004STUL", "0780624890", "B00011CZRE", "B004SIP95G", "B00005JKZY", "B00005JA8B", "B00E5I2M6I", "B0090SI56Y", "B0009MDPYM", "B008JFUPFI", "B00005JNTU", "B002IPFWTE", "B000P0J06U", "B001F7MSFM", "B000AYELVU", "B007K3JFUQ", "B00005JMQW", "B0049IHX2C", "B0007P0XBO", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B0085A9HU6", "B00AEFY5B6", "B008JFUO72", "B00006HBUJ", "B001AK3S4Y", "B000P0J0EW", "B0007V6ITE", "0767834739", "B00005JLWN", "B0000VCZK2", "B00FEHCQEC", "B0014Z4ON4", "B001UV4XHY", "B002GSXKNI", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00070FX5U", "B00177YA1K", "B00005JKIP", "B003QO8TOQ", "B000U1ZV8K", "B002ZG980U", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0045HCJGC", "B00000JQB5", "B00005JL78", "B004EPYZUS", "B002ZG99QS", "B000AP04FG", "B000HEVZ9E", "B000OVLBF8"], "bought_together": ["B0000AXE8I", "B000P0J0AQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001DJLD1M", "B000P0J0AQ", "B0000AXE8I", "B001BRJZPW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 123737}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.95, "brand": "Matrix", "asin": "B0001BKAEE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5149DT5Y2CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Matrix Revolutions (Two-Disc Full Screen Edition) [DVD]"}
{"description": "Tony Kushner's prize-winningplayAngels in Americabecame the  defining theatrical event of the 1990s, an astonishing mix of philosophy,  politics, and vibrant gay soap opera that summed up the Reagan era for an  entire generation of theater-goers. Post-9/11 would  seem to be too late for a film version--philosophy and politics don't  always age well--but this 2003 HBO adaptation, ably directed by Mike Nichols  (The Graduate), provides a time capsule of the '80s and reveals the  deep emotional subcurrents that will give the play lasting power.The story centers around Prior Walter  (Justin Kirk) and Louis Ironson (Ben Shenkman), a gay couple that falls  apart when Prior grows ill as a result of AIDS. But cancer is not the only  thing invading Prior's life: He begins to have religious visions of an  angel (Emma Thompson,Sense and Sensibility) announcing that he is  a prophet. Louis, who doesn't cope well with disease and suggestions of  mortality, leaves and starts a relationship with Joe Pitt (Patrick  Wilson), a closeted Mormon who works for Roy Cohn (Al Pacino,Dog Day  Afternoon)--the real-life right-wing lawyer, notorious for his  ruthless behind-the-scenes machinations. Add in Joe's depressed and  hallucinating wife Harper (Mary Louise Parker,Fried Green  Tomatoes), his determined but open-minded mother Hannah (Meryl Streep,Adaptation), a fierce drag queen/nurse named Belize (Jeffrey  Wright,Basquiat, reprising his celebrated performance from the  Broadway production), and you've still only begun to discover the wealth  of characters and storylines in Kushner's ambitious work.The  powerhouse cast (also featuring James Cromwell, Michael Gambon, and Simon  Callow) is uniformly superb. The script has its weaknesses--some of the  fantastic elements, including Prior's journey to Heaven towards the end,  fall flat--but even what doesn't work is bristling with ideas and a  ferocious desire to capture human existence in this time and place.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["1559362316", "B00005AQMJ", "B000067D0Y", "B00A92MGLA", "0800141806", "B00KMULA9I", "B000053VAW", "1559360739", "B003VZNAU8", "B004AR4W4O", "B0000560PU", "B00005B8U4", "B000BZISX0", "B00D2UMHIS", "B006QVRVW2", "B0001HAGRE", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00018D3YQ", "B00996RSYM", "B003IG06PM", "B001CQONPE", "1559360615", "B00AEFY8MM", "B00005AWR9", "B00005JO5L", "B00005MKKV", "B00EU8RB14", "B00005QW5X", "B0000AYJV8", "B0045HCJ94", "B0000TAZB0", "B00EJGMF22", "B00008UALE", "B0030BOCFU", "0802136923", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B008SAPCAM", "B0007ZEOPK", "B001QUF3SW", "B00I4CWIVU", "B005ETAMFK", "B000PAAK5U", "B00005JOFQ", "B00GHP8SH4", "B0009W5IMO", "B00114XLZA", "B00F98FOPE", "B001Y7CVXC", "B007C95S9K", "B00G7QPXUI", "B000A9QK5K", "B00AXGX4DQ", "B0045HCJ8U", "B006QVRVJK", "B00H7LJ2UO", "B002VECLVO", "B00127RAGC", "B00008R9KD", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00005JKIS", "B00005JKJA", "B005S9EIGU", "B004SIP71M", "B000NIVJFY", "B002SSNFUO", "B000228EGS", "B00003L9CK", "B004SUDQ1S", "B007V4QKYI", "1559363606", "B004LB5FCW", "B00005N89S", "B009XJ5ED2", "B0083V2VYG", "B000UPMZ30", "0767821009", "B002IVDLH8", "B00005V5NU", "B00GUO3C3W", "B00C1LIZMQ", "B000GG4Y32", "B009D004TA", "0802122388", "B00007L4MV", "155936078X", "B000WDVNMO", "B000068MBW", "1559363959", "B00004TJH0", "0571169341", "B00000F3FS", "B00FGVS0DM", "B000H5V8H2", "B0006GVJEY", "B0001HAGRY", "B000065V3L", "B0042L0OG8", "B00HUTPKA4", "B000YHQNCI", "B0030BOCMS"], "bought_together": ["1559362316"], "buy_after_viewing": ["1559362316", "B00005AQMJ", "B00AQKU1QC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23141}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 15.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001I2BUI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512MTZBBPML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Angels in America"}

{"description": "The key players in the radical movement known as the Weather Underground are skillfully brought to life in this Oscar-nominated documentary. The Weathermen were born of sixties protest, but took their scheme to overthrow the U.S. government to especially violent extremes. Never a well-populated movement, the Underground petered out as its leaders aged during the seventies; by decade's end, weary of hiding, most of them had turned themselves over to the authorities. That journey, by which a fire-breathing revolutionary such as Bernadine Dohrn became a (still fiery) gray-haired wife and mother, is an intriguing one. This film, rich in period footage (and some unnecessary sensationalism) captures the era somewhat broadly.

{"description": "As the triumphant start of a trilogy,The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ringleaves you begging for more. By necessity, Peter Jackson's ambitious epic compresses J.R.R. Tolkien's classicThe Lord of the Rings, but this robust adaptation maintains reverent allegiance to Tolkien's creation, instantly qualifying as one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. At 178 minutes, it's long enough to establish the myriad inhabitants of Middle-earth, the legendary Rings of Power, and the fellowship of hobbits, elves, dwarves, and humans--led by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the brave hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood)--who must battle terrifying forces of evil on their perilous journey to destroy the One Ring in the land of Mordor. Superbly paced, the film is both epic and intimate, offering astonishing special effects and production design while emphasizing the emotional intensity of Frodo's adventure, and ends on a perfect note of heroic loyalty and rich anticipation.After the breaking of the Fellowship, Frodo and Sam journey to Mordor with the creature Gollum as their guide inThe Two Towers. Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) join in the defense of the people of Rohan, who are the first target in the eradication of the race of Men by the renegade wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee) and the dark lord Sauron. Fantastic creatures, astounding visual effects, and a climactic battle at the fortress of Helm's Deep makeThe Two Towersa worthy successor toThe Fellowship of the Ring, grander in scale but retaining the story's emotional intimacy.WithThe Return of the King, the greatest fantasy epic in film history draws to a grand and glorious conclusion. The trilogy could never fully satisfy those who remain exclusively loyal to Tolkien's expansive literature, but as a showcase for physical and technical craftsmanship it is unsurpassed in pure scale and ambition, setting milestone after cinematic milestone as Frodo and Sam continue their mission to Mordor to destroy the soul-corrupting One Ring. While the heir to the kingdom of Men, Aragorn, endures the massive battle at Minas Tirith with the allegiance of Legolas, Gimli, and Gandalf, Frodo and Sam must survive the schizoid deceptions of Gollum, who remains utterly convincing as a hybrid of performance (by Andy Serkis) and subtly nuanced computer animation. Jackson and cowriters Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens have much ground to cover; that they do so with intense pacing and epic sweep is impressive enough, but by investing greater depth and consequence in the actions of fellow hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), they ensure thatThe Return of the Kingmaintains the trilogy's emphasis on intimate fellowship and remains faithful to Tolkien's overall vision. By ending theLOTRtrilogy with noble integrity and faith in the power of imaginative storytelling,The Return of the King, like its predecessors, will stand as an adventure for the ages.--Jeff Shannon and David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B005OCFGTO", "B001DJLD1M", "B001BYMX4A", "B009JBWOU0", "B00003CXCT", "B00005JPH2", "B001BRJZPW", "B000QXDED6", "B000E8M0VA", "B000VWYJ86", "B000HEVZ9E", "B005COPWZW", "B00005JKZY", "0345538374", "B001F12J0C", "B0057RCFQS", "B00003CWT6", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00003CXC5", "B000I0RQVI", "B0060FXDCG", "B0054OGQM8", "B004M1A21K", "B001DHXT20", "B008MIMWP8", "B008JFUO72", "B001VLFE7G", "B00G1BPIOU", "B002HWRYJE", "B000YGDNPO", "B000VBIGCW", "B00E9PMML2", "B004H83IM8", "B004EPZ08O", "B0015XHP4A", "B001E75QH0", "B0090SI56Y", "B000P0J0AQ", "B001VLBDD0", "B008JFUS0U", "B00IV2I7IQ", "B003PIUINS", "B000UR9T8C", "B000U7WV1Y", "B006VRRGNK", "B007D5E7C2", "0345518845", "B0049IHX2C", "B00AZMFJYA", "B0015I2RT8", "B004LWZWGA", "B002I9Z8I0", "B0001HLVS2", "B002VPE1AW", "B004LWZW42", "B00003CXZ4", "B00E5I2MCM", "B004EPYZU8", "B008JFURII", "B00003CXC3", "B005LAIH54", "6305313687", "B0084IG8TM", "B00000K3D4", "B001CK1D44", "B00AEFXDO6", "B002ZG999U", "B00E9PMMX0", "B0042U94UQ", "B00275EGWY", "B001KVZ6FW", "B003Q6D2B4", "B000J4P9P8", "B0001Z4OXS", "B00177YA1K", "B003UYUQZW", "B0019L770A", "B000E6ESEY", "B003AWRMCE", "B000HCO83Q", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B0083SBMBM", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00011CZRE", "079284646X", "B00008G8M5", "B002ZG97YM", "B002ZG980U", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000U1ZV8K", "B008UZA8FY", "B005LAIIMG", "B004EPZ084", "B003EYVXTG", "B00005JKZV", "B00447L4JG"], "bought_together": ["B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HWWUQWQ", "B00005JKZY", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00003CWT6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 72846}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 39.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001VL0K2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51z4rwl-jOL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Johnny Depp gets high off another acting challenge in this tricky adaptation of aStephen King yarn. Although the mood is too sinister to allow for the mischief of hisPirates of the Caribbeanturn, Depp still manages to embroider his role here with plenty of quirky business. He plays a writer, depressed and nearly divorced, who's stuck in an isolated cabin (shades ofThe Shining) when a stranger (John Turturro) arrives, accusing him of plagiarism. Writer-director David Koepp (Stir of Echoes) does his best to make the rickety material compelling--he gets the maximum out of the cabin set, for instance--but the problems inherent in the King story eventually win out. The climactic scenes are particularly unpleasant, especially in contrast to the cleverness of Depp's performance.

{"description": "After proving its long-term potential inseason 2,Star Trek: Voyagerserved up some of the best episodes in its entire seven-year history. The second-season cliffhanger was intelligently resolved in \"Basics, Pt. II,\" and the fan-favorite \"Flashback\" placed Tuvok (Tim Russ) aboard theU.S.S. ExcelsiorfromStar Trek VI, under the command of Capt. Sulu (Star Trekalumnus George Takei). It was a brilliant example of interseries plotting, just as \"False Profits\" was a Ferengi-based sequel to theNextGenepisode \"The Price.\" The two-part time-travel scenario of \"Future's End\" is aVoyagerhighlight, with clear echoes (including dialogue lifted verbatim!) ofStar Trek's classic \"The City on the Edge of Forever,\" featuring delightful guest performances by actress-comedienne Sarah Silverman and Ed Begley Jr. Character-wise, the season belonged to Kes (Jennifer Lien, whose tenure on the series was now near its end), Neelix (Ethan Phillips), and the Doctor (Robert Picardo), who shined (respectively) in \"Warlord,\" \"Fair Trade,\" and the surprisingly touching \"Real Life\" (the latter directed by \"Potsie\" himself,Happy Daysveteran Anson Williams). By infecting B'Elanna (Roxanne Dawson) with a fellow officer's \"Blood Fever,\"Voyagerdelved into the turbulent Vulcan ritual of Pon Farr, while the cliffhanger \"Scorpion\" introduced the relentless, Borg-destroying villains of Species 8472, which would pose a continuing threat in subsequent episodes.Season 3 had a few clunkers (the guilty pleasure \"Macrocosm\" puts Janeway in stripped-down \"Ripley\" mode against invading macro-viruses, and Ensign Kim is an awkward \"Favorite Son\" to a bevy of babes), but for every misstep there's a strong science-fiction concept, like the highly-evolved Hadrosaurs in \"Distant Origin,\" which doubles as a compelling indictment of institutionalized repression. Overall, this is rock-solidTrek, and the DVD features are equally engaging, albeit growing more perfunctory (especially the season 3 summary) with each full-season release. Don't forget the Easter eggs hidden on the special-features menus, however; they contain some of the set's happiest surprises.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002JP4GE", "B0001NBNFW", "B0002WZTCA", "B000127LW2", "B00062IDLA", "B00062IDCO", "B00008KA5A", "B00008KGT0", "B00008KA59", "B00008KA58", "B0009I7NGW", "B000A6CLL0", "B00008972H", "B00008KA57", "B000AOEMXC", "B00005JLF5", "B0007TKH66", "B000063V8R", "B000063V8S", "B000063V8T", "B00BHWG0DQ", "B00BHWG0CM", "B000062XFG", "B00005Y1NF", "B00062RCC6", "B000RZIGVS", "B000AOEMXM", "B001DHXT3Y", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001DHXT6G", "B002I9Z8GM", "B002BAW6GI", "B002BAW6FY", "B000CCBCIA", "B0017VG69U", "B0042YZFYG", "B000VDDDY6", "B002I9Z8I0", "B003H9LIRK", "B00IYRLUAU", "B000HEWEJ4", "6303961614", "B00CYQXHLC", "B00GTZWZH6", "B002BAW6H2", "B003H9LIU2", "B003ZFC9M4", "B00IURL19Y", "B00BHWG1AI", "B000CNE0T2", "B000F8O2OW", "B00129W6LE", "B000ERVJJ0", "B001RHGRTS", "B00BHWG0G8", "B00BN0WQ5I", "B00F3L8P26", "B00BD6K54G", "B000HEZEY6", "B002BAW6FE", "B008JFUS0U", "B004HYW84G", "B001MT7ZIS", "B0000AUHOH", "B0019N95IK", "B00CTSDDVO", "B00061QJSK", "B003Y7JWZ0", "B000CNE0TC", "B000JLTRHW", "B00HETWFVC", "B00J11U54K", "B0081QF6Q8", "B000BOH990", "B005X4P3DC", "B000CQM4YM", "B00C7A8WNS", "B000EXDS34", "B000F8O2PQ", "B000CNE0SS", "B00B7VZN76", "B00FFEM0W2", "B00243FQFA", "B0095XPZBC", "B000HT3Q2I", "B004EXWGHY", "B00CRX82LM", "B009KU4IWM", "B000B8IA2G", "B0007UDCX0", "B0017MO10U", "B00CG5WY0Q", "B004TJ1H3C", "B008H1Q61G", "B00IWTVDUW", "B000F8O2P6", "B002BAW6GS", "B000ELL1QC", "B00008GEK4", "B002I9Z8EO"], "bought_together": ["B0002JP4GE", "B0002WZTCA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001NBNFW", "B0002JP4GE", "B000127LW2", "B00062IDLA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 29008}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 39.98, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B000228EBS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z%2BbMhm0SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek Voyager - The Complete Third Season"}

{"description": "A sweet and sly comedy,Seeing Other Peoplecenters around Ed (Jay  Mohr,Jerry Maguire) and Alice (Julianne Nicholson,Ally  McBeal), who have an idyllic relationship--so stable that, only a few  months before their wedding, Alice worries that she's missed out; she's  only slept with two other men before Ed. Anxious about her lack of  experience, she proposes that they start seeing other people so she can  have cheap, meaningless sex. But after a promising start that revitalizes  their relationship, this arrangement starts spinning off in dangerous  directions. Attention to psychological detail--as well as a great cast, a  well-written script, and smooth, underplayed direction--keepSeeing  Other Peoplefrom slipping into the usual clich&#xE9;s of broad sex  comedies. The result is clever, genuine, and enjoyable. Also featuring  Andy Richter (New York Minute), Lauren Graham (The Gilmore  Girls), Josh Charles (S.W.A.T.), and Helen Slater  (Supergirl).--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00BEJL6JK", "B000MX7TXQ", "B00009AV8C", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B0006Z2ND6", "B006M3M5FM", "B001AR011U", "B002LBKDZI", "B00006AUIH", "B0007PALGG", "B003QZSWRY", "B0031DRZEC", "B000BDGWI0", "B000EMG922", "B000QUEQ4K", "B00H9KKKAY", "6302958822", "B0015S2OXM", "B008DL4IYC", "B00009XN8U", "B000083C83", "B0073JF2WC", "B000QUTS9S"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000MX7TXQ", "B0006Z2ND6", "B00009AV8C"]}, "price": 9.28, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 195124}, "asin": "B00026L920", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417VE1F65YL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Seeing Other People"}

{"description": "It has its own stormy weather and fire-breathing housepet named Spot, but the mansion at 1313 Mockingbird Heights is otherwise like any other American sitcom home. This is the address of the Munsters, the family that for two seasons, 1964-66, found a permanent place in pop culture--if not \"monster\" success. Developed byLeave It to Beaverteam Joe Connelly and Bob Mosher, the series was a standard sitcom (complete with the same awful canned laughter), except that the Ward Cleaver character was a reanimated corpse.Dad Herman (Fred Gwynne) was a Frankenstein's monster, mom Lily (Yvonne DeCarlo) and Grandpa (Al Lewis) were vampires, and son Eddie (Butch Patrick) a little wolf-boy. Munster niece Marilyn was inexplicably normal, which prompted much worry from the other members of the family (she was played in early episodes by Beverly Owen, who left to get married, and then by Pat Priest). The plots revolve around typically tortured sitcom situations:  Herman must lose weight to fit into his old Army uniform, Herman has insomnia, Herman takes dance lessons from a crooked instructor. (As that list would suggest, 6'5\" Fred Gwynne's wonderfully agile slapstick and Borscht Belt comedy made him the center of the show.)What distinguishedThe MunstersfromFather Knows Bestwas the Universal horror-movie lineage and the ghoulish one-liners (the latter growing a bit tedious after a while). The three-disc DVD has all 38 first-season episodes in excellent transfers, a 15-minute pilot with different actors as Lily and Eddie, and no extras or commentaries. High points include \"Hot Rod Herman,\" which features the tricked-out Munster Koach and Drag-u-la (boss wagons both), and \"Eddie's Nickname,\" the one where Grandpa gives Eddie a potion that causes the boy's beard to grow (a weirdly memorable image, if you're a kid). The show was either pure kiddie farce or a radical comment on the absurdly unreal world of sitcoms. Either way, if you grew up with them as an alternate TV family, you can't help but have warm feelings for the Munsters, as clammy as they are.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00A2L1CJK", "B000HEZEYG", "B000GIXIN2", "B000LC4ZIA", "B000RO9PTQ", "B000V6LSNQ", "B001DZOCZK", "B0006BAWSI", "B001NRPQKI", "B0009B16TO", "B0050MB5AC", "B000N6UF10", "B000HWZ4J8", "B0000V4906", "B0009OUBPQ", "B0014FAIYS", "B000V3JGIS", "B0072BNJ0I", "B00000F61N", "B000E3L7FK", "B000EQ46HI", "B000E33VZ4", "B0006Z2L4W", "B0007KIFK0", "B001E6JC30", "B0002NY8PI", "B00DXLO086", "B009OE2NZI", "B000ASDFIQ", "B001BN4WHW", "B00005JNS8", "B0006TPE1U", "B0000DC3VM", "B000Y7U9AK", "B002AMVEHY", "B000TD48SI", "B001LM64VK", "B0007V6IWQ", "6305744793", "B000P6R9IA", "B000BT96OG", "B000BITV1A", "B00H8KC1N4", "B001992NZG", "B000MGBSH6", "B00G5N6C8U", "B00DXLO0D6", "B005SQRYOG", "B000HIVIOM", "B004EI2NO0", "B006TTC5J0", "B0002ZMHVI", "B000UX6TJI", "B0002IQKAY", "B006Z7Z3ZO", "B000M343B2", "B0001MZ7J6", "B000AL733G", "B006VC3L9S", "B0012EM5E2", "B000CELOW2", "B0000B1A5A", "B00005LC4L", "B000KLQUSK", "B004KDYR5W", "B001GMH8WE", "B0001MZ7IC", "B0001CNQUS", "B000291Q3O", "B000BYRCF6", "B00GOC75YW", "B000ERVJKO", "B000068V9X", "B00BQK4YDC", "B00023P4O2", "B001MBTSTU", "B000HWZ4E8", "B0009B16TY", "B000TXPXD2", "B0014VPFKY", "B002E58FT2", "B003JHXS5A", "B0089BSLKS", "B001N26GSE", "B00CPTUNR4", "B00005LC4K", "B00IF0KAYS", "B0007Y08P6", "B001D7T6AO", "B00GWJIDB6", "B00198X0YK", "B00AJCUL2G", "B000UX6TL6", "B00GHH9HW2", "B001992NXI", "B00J9BZ4KC", "B00DGNFMJW", "B000MGBSQC", "B00GOC75V0", "B0012Q3SZ0"], "bought_together": ["B00A2L1CJK", "B000HEZEYG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001DZOCZU", "B000HEZEYG", "B00A2L1CJK", "B0006BAWSI"]}, "price": 39.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 125145}, "asin": "B0002CX1LG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EYD0TAXSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Munsters - The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "As the fourth season ofAngelstarts, everything is still as we left it: Angel has been sunk to the bottom of the sea in an iron box by his inexplicable and vindictive son Connor and Cordelia has been summoned to higher realms to await orders. Gunn and Fred are left in the Hyperion Hotel, unsure about what has happened to their friends, and Lilah is working hard to seduce Wesley to the dark side. In the first few episodes, some of this is resolved but it's almost immediately replaced by far worse crises: prophesies of doom accumulate more rapidly even than usual in this wonderfully gloomy show and a horned rock-like beast rains fire on Los Angeles. This last year isAngel's most tightly dramatic season yet--with a story arc of surprising intensity punctuated by the show's usual wit and sexiness.Season 4 is presented on DVD in Dolby 2.0 Surround Sound and anamorphic widescreen. It comes with insightful, and often hilarious, commentaries on seven of the 22 episodes as well as featurettes--a series overview, profiles of the characters of Jasmine and the Beast, a farewell to the Hyperion Hotel (the characters' base for three seasons), and a discussion of the apocalypse that Angel has to deal with from episode 7 onwards).--Roz Kaveney", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000I0QLS2", "B000I0QLRI", "B000I0QLR8", "B000I0QLQY", "B000EHSVN2", "B000EHSVMS", "B000EHSVM8", "B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVLE", "B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVKK", "B0006IUE16", "B0009W5J4Q", "B007H9CNOI", "B000CCBCGM", "B0024FAR66", "B000B5XOW0", "B0046XG48O", "B000OIOPHC", "B000JLTRIG", "B000RO6JYK", "B001992NWO", "B000ERVJM2", "B00AMDA2QC", "B00006J3WH", "B001L1S1OY", "B002JVWR4A", "1593078226", "B000HT3P60", "B0053O89IS", "B002JVWR4U", "B000GG4Y6O", "B009LDCXNY", "B00HUPC5X8", "B0000AQS0F", "B000BOH990", "B00JF5GAZA", "B009LDD4V4", "B000FP2OPY", "B000X5SPBI", "B000HD1482", "B002CLKP00", "B003L77G8I", "B00133QNSG", "B002JVWRAO", "B000N6SE4U", "B000G1R4SO", "159307784X", "B000T9OP7G", "B0011FLGZQ", "B000QDLSR0", "B003L77GGK", "B00008KA57", "B006LG74Q0", "B000FIMG68", "B00001R3O1", "B0009JE6FC", "B001MVWRMU", "1569717516", "B001FB4W0C", "B009LDCWWG", "B002N5N5MK", "B001B7CNZ6", "1595826106", "B000NOKFGW", "B000F8O2PG", "B0001JXPPC", "B000O77SMW", "B00020H9NO", "B000R7GKQE", "B005X4P3DC", "B0085KGG96", "B003BV8I7C", "B004YM6JI2", "B00006FD9N", "B000BOH98G", "0785168370", "B000PMFRTC", "B001M5UDGS", "B000CNE0SS", "1613770596", "1593078269", "B00133QNS6", "B00IWTVDUW", "B001MVWRN4", "B00243FQFA", "B000A5045Q", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B001MVWRMK", "B0008FPJ7Q", "B00BBXSPES", "B001AQO43M", "B0024FAD9C", "B000BOH986", "159307963X", "B00133QNRW", "B003L77GH4", "B000GG4Y28", "B002XD0J80", "B00008KGT0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000I0QLRI", "B000I0QLR8", "B000I0QLQY", "B000I0QLS2"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 165905}, "asin": "B0002HS74C", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PP1E7PZZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Angel - Season Four"}
{"description": "Unspeakableis a suitably spooky variation onThe Silence of the Lambscrossed withThe X-Files, and features a wonderfully delirious Dennis Hopper performance to boot. The legendary actor plays a gentleman sadist of a warden, with little tolerance for an experimental memory-graphing program in use at his prison by Diana, a resilient scientist (Dina Meyer). The capture of an escaped serial killer, Jesse (Pavan Grover), brings researcher and brilliant madman together in a Clarice-Hannibal fashion; the difference is that Grover's character is an evolved human with powerful telepathic abilities. Between invading Diana's thoughts and projecting fantasies into her memory machine, Jesse provokes guards and the warden himself into self-destructive insanity. Lance Henriksen and Jeff Fahey add extra substance to the cast, and the entire, grisly production has a sure-handed look and feel under the direction of Thomas J.

Maria is a Colombian teenager who, for a large paycheck, agrees to be a mule for drug-runners:  she has to swallow dozens of thumb-sized capsules of heroin and smuggle them into New York. This debilitating process is painstakingly described, and of course not everything goes as planned when Maria and her fellow mules land in America. Director Joshua Marston is working on a low budget, which explains the film's narrow, single-minded focus--but this may be a strength, not a weakness. The trump card is the lead performance of Catalina Sandrino Moreno, who won awards at the Seattle and Newport Film Festivals. Her empathetic face carries us along on Maria's journey, and humanizes a problem that is too easily relegated to a headline.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002FHGESI", "B00005JNCZ", "B0041KKYF6", "B000N3T0DW", "B00080Z53O", "B000O76ZQC", "B00005N8A9", "B00180IPM6", "B00008AOX5", "B0036TGSJE", "B008S2NABI", "B000YIGNCC", "B0007NBJHI", "B0042EJDGM", "B000RHRGSK", "B00AZMFKXK", "B005HFI7IU", "B000LV6OC6", "B00005JL57", "B0015ET3YO", "B003A0T8BO", "B004XVMCMG", "B000WC38IC", "B002M2T1VI", "B000N3SU6K", "B001ILTUKQ", "B0052LE7C4", "B005FIXA6S", "B002E01LOI", "B00GJNQ3S0", "B0047685T6", "B00075VX2C", "B00005JLQW", "B000AM4P90", "B001UV4XC4", "B004SIP7S0", "B00006G8G3", "B004SIP6GI", "B00005LZOD", "B0011FLH14", "B004MNM1FI", "B002M2T1V8", "B0086900LG", "B002BWP3UC", "B00E5G03KM", "B000AYEIDQ", "B00134PSV8", "B001FOPOD8", "B0000AMU29", "B00003CXRG", "B0014BQR6U", "B000274TLW", "B000LXHFMW", "B0000C9JFO", "B0001CNQX0", "B00004U1FA", "B00E1S1MMM", "B007961SAE", "B000GETTJI", "B004IF4EVY", "B00F6Y3E26", "B0032AJVE6", "B003O3EKRO", "B003X3BYJM", "B0009HLC9W", "B0000714BS", "B00000F5KH", "B002VECLXC", "B0000714BQ", "B0009S4IGK", "B002FUI4CE", "B00006BS7S", "B00APUAKYG", "B000K2V7F0", "B000SLYE6M", "0764146076", "B0000A2ZTY", "B0002VEZ3U", "1444137697", "B001M5BF7Y", "B000KJU15U", "B001Q56XOA", "B001QX014A", "0070020698", "B001S400C0", "B000VXUW0E", "B00H1RMPH6", "B000QYKDFC", "B000067IZ3", "B000JBXH78", "B00IQIAL8Y", "B007L6VPXC", "B0051T46YG", "B0002DRDIW", "B002EZLPOO", "B000N3T0DM", "B0002RQ316", "B0000U0X20", "B0013HL6ES"], "bought_together": ["B000O76ZQC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00180IPM6", "B0036TGSJE", "B005HFI7IU", "B000O76ZQC"]}, "price": 4.09, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3577}, "asin": "B0002TT0MI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51o4PdGtr3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Maria Full of Grace"}

{"description": "The eighth season ofFriendspicks up just moments after Monica and Chandler said, \"I do.\" But the focus of this season is firmly on Rachel's pregnancy, as the story progresses from fatherhood revelations in \"The One with the Red Sweater\" and \"The One Where Rachel Tells...\" toward complicated new feelings for Rachel, Ross, and Joey, culminating in the maternity ward two-parter \"The One Where Rachel Has a Baby.\"  But it's not all Rachel's pregnancy story. Standalone highlights include \"The One with the Rumor\" in which the \"We Hate Rachel\" club started in high school by Ross and a certain Mr. Jennifer Aniston (an uncredited Brad Pitt) is revealed; while \"The One with Monica's Boots\" has Monica and Chandler arguing over finances when Phoebe and Ross are arguing over the attentions of Sting's wife, Trudie Styler (cameoing as herself). Relationship complications fall upon Phoebe as \"The One with the Tea Leaves\" hooks her up with a stellar cameo from Alec Baldwin. \"The One with Joey's Interview\" has Matt LeBlanc in top form preparing to be interviewed bySoap Opera Digest. But time starts to tick faster for everyone in \"The One Where Rachel Is Late,\" as Joey's WWI movie finally arrives, but is overshadowed by the wait for Rachel's overdue arrival. Naturally it's all build-up to the cliffhanger finale and a final emotional surprise.--Paul Tonks", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006ZM8M2", "B0001AW066", "B003TNW030", "B003TNW03A", "B0000C2IXN", "B003TNW04Y", "B0000844MI", "B000068CNX", "B005IA9JSG", "B003TNW02G", "B005MG8UNG", "B00020HAWY", "B005IA9JRM", "B005IA9JQ8", "B005IA9JVI", "B001BJARX4", "B000HT3P7E", "B00B1LKXPY", "B0019CSXAM", "B000TM1CKQ", "B0024FAR6Q", "B000NOKFH6", "B0009WFEEG", "B0001907BW", "B005SJGIV8", "B000GPIPTM", "B008LCRA98", "B00005JLEX", "B008LCRABQ", "B000SINT4S", "B000EHSVLE", "B0002I84FS", "B003UD7JAI", "B000AJJNI6", "B002N5N4FS", "B000NNK4DW", "B000EBGFPY", "B008L0YMZA", "B00005JNEQ", "B000GRUMQY", "B000VZADPQ", "B000A7PKGW", "B00BUWD7Y8", "B008LCRAC0", "B000QFCDAO", "B00B04NII6", "B003L77G6U", "B00005JN0Z", "B000640WGM", "B000IJ79VG", "B0007R4SWC", "B000T22PVG", "B003SNJY1C", "B001BNFR6M", "B000GETTKM", "B005D0OHA6", "B00A1AU72A", "B000LV6O12", "B0044LYRFA", "B000Q6GUW0", "B000ERVK5S", "B0006Q93AQ", "B007C8RZL0", "B005IA9JQI", "B000EHSVN2", "B008KZX7W0", "B001TKJDNA", "B00AEFYM2S", "B000EHSVM8", "B007C8RZR4", "B0053O8AFK", "B000R9YLKY", "B000N6TYLW", "B000002N2P", "B000V86OKG", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B000W91RUG", "B000I0QLR8", "B002N5N5NE", "B00BT1XCOU", "B00A81MV3U", "0767808673", "B002BJGYV2", "0767827686", "B000HT3P6U", "B003Y5H5B0", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00BNWWYE4", "B00BUWD7E8", "B009LDD1X0", "B00IWTVDUW", "B001F7AQDS", "B008JFUS5A", "B008X6N8KW"], "bought_together": ["B0006ZM8M2", "B0001AW066"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005IA9JQI", "B0001AW066", "B003TNW04Y", "B005IA9JSG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 40813}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 15.58, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B0002WZN8K", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61BN59G5HAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Friends: Season 8"}

{"description": "Neve Campbell is an arresting enigma inWhen Will I Be Loved, one of writer-director James Toback's most mysterious and successful minimalist dramas about sex, deception, and mutable identities in New York City. Campbell plays twentysomething beauty Vera, whose nude shower scene during the film's opening credits looks more like mythic preparation for a soon-to-be-fateful day than brazen exploitation. Ensconced in a fantastic loft paid for by her parents (Barry Primus, Karen Allen), the unemployed Vera embarks on an odyssey that begins with a mutually deceitful job interview with a college professor (Toback), leads to misadventures in questionable perception in Central Park, and climaxes with Vera's successful manipulation of two powerful men, one a craven lover (Fred Weller) and the other an Italian billionaire (Dominic Chianese) trying to get her in bed for a lot of money.

{"description": "A big, bruising epic of the Korean War,Tae Guk Gismashed box-office records when it played in South Korea in 2004, almost as though the country needed to re-live the trauma at a 50-year distance. For the rest of the world,  this movie looks like a ground-level reckoning in a melodramatic key, with an authentic feel for battle lines as well as home front.Tae Guk Gifollows two brothers--one uneducated and forceful, the other intellectual and reserved--as they are united and then divided by the conflict. The broadly emotional story has some of the power of tales of the American Civil War, when family members found themselves on opposite sides of a battle. Director Kang Je-gyu , who made the lively female-assassin hitShiri, takes a blunt approach to the material (including aSaving Private Ryan-style framing device). And at 150 minutes, he has plenty of time for head-splitting, blood-spraying combat. This movie is meant as a punch in the stomach, and it connects.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0076XTIWU", "B007S0DCUU", "B003OXGW5M", "B004LE4FKM", "B008645YLM", "B0076XTFF0", "B006C1S1DY", "B007S0DB56", "B004H2CXBQ", "B004SJVQ4I", "B0009NZ78I", "B002QP145C", "B00C6WHPO4", "B00BTFK014", "B005E2YL3Q", "B00005AVZU", "B00A3TFMDI", "B0009S2T0M", "B00C2535TE", "B000NVT0RU", "B007WXUVHU", "B003Y7F1IW", "B0000633R6", "B005ZMBEXA", "B004GNBBVO", "B00D3XMA9A", "B00CLH09UQ", "B003JDQJM8", "B008645Z0M", "B0002J4X20", "B000GBEWNY", "B003NLE5JA", "B000BGH2A4", "B00BC1UPRO", "B003OXSRWI", "B00CG0YLS4", "B00CHYSSME", "B0019PL2W0", "B0099SI178", "B0030A6ICG", "B005OTGS4E", "B008OTTRE4", "B00A705TOU", "B0009XRZQK", "B00AN5LCOA", "B00D3XM7H0", "B005DKS1TE", "B0046YK4KW", "B00CAT3T8Y", "B004H2IMSO", "B0015DLZXM", "B00005U8F4", "B003EYEEI8", "B00005R87B", "B002C6VMIY", "B004P2VQZ2", "B00598YUOK", "B0011FDVGI", "B009VL2AZM", "B000E1EHPE", "B0035JHYHA", "B002P7UCJK", "B0051SFTGQ", "B005HG8VE4", "B000GSYRY6", "B001KEHAEE", "B009XTF8NI", "B00IVLR9JA", "B000P7V4MG", "B000A1OFZA", "B00HRYH52I", "B00772M1D8", "B007HCI42A", "B0009UKV5U", "B000GSE6H4", "B003PMWF62", "B00ENTX7JU", "9713727150", "B00576U9HQ", "B00ID8HATK", "B0001611CO", "B006UTDH6O", "B0000BWVCR", "B000E3LD5E", "B000PKG8TW", "B0082SIGR6", "B00ALCBTWU", "B003DVB7F0", "B00080ETYA", "B00CBDG4UY", "B004TXFFI6", "B000MGBLIC", "B00J5G1P2W", "B0036TGSV2", "B00004STDA", "B000MRA542", "B0014CKCE2", "B00C6WHSRI", "0792841662", "B005HQBO9I"], "bought_together": ["B007S0DCUU", "B0076XTIWU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007S0DCUU", "B0076XTIWU", "B004LE4FKM", "B00BC1UPRO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 35302}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.25, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0006VL1J2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K30W34ZFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tae Guk Gi - The Brotherhood of War"}

{"description": "John Grisham wrote the screenplay for and produced the enjoyableMickey, a family drama that explores--typical of the bestselling author--seemingly unresolvable conflicts between the personal and the ethical. Harry Connick Jr. plays California attorney Tripp Spence, a widower whose recent bankruptcy has come under scrutiny from the IRS. Admitting wrongdoing to his son, Derrick (Shawn Salinas), Tripp vows to avoid jail, and the two head for Las Vegas under assumed identities. Rather than stay out of sight, however, Tripp talks the manager (Mike Starr) of a first-rate Little League team into drafting Derrick, a 13-year-old, talented pitcher who claims to be younger. Soon Derrick is attracting national attention, precisely what Tripp doesn't want, yet he refuses to squelch his son's brilliant ride to the top. Hugh Wilson (Guarding Tess) directed this brisk, smart feature, which includes a generous amount of on-the-field baseball action and an intriguing subplot about Cuban ball players.--Tom KeoghStills fromMickeyHarry Connick Jr. as Tripp SpenceShawn Salinas as Derrick, a.k.a.

If this sounds like a very commercial, science fiction thriller,Primeris anything but that.

{"description": "A vintage Stephen King concept unfolds inRiding the Bullet:  a college kid, circa 1970, must hitchhike a very long (and very dark) hundred miles to visit his hospitalized mother. The ghosts waiting for him along the way are either real or of his own mind (which seems to be a dark place itself). As a King short story, this might have been a usefully frightening premise, but it's almost entirely literary; on screen, it boils down to a guy walking down a road at night. Jonathan Jackson is suitably tortured in the lead role (or roles--he frequently appears double on screen, arguing with himself), but the movie is stolen by David Arquette, rocking it up as a '50s greaser who died in a car crash years earlier. Barbara Hershey and Erika Christensen are wasted in support. There's a strain to make the Woodstock-era setting relevant, but this doesn't seem to have a great deal to do with the private demons of the protagonist. (And if you're going to set it in 1970, how hard is it to catch dialogue anachronisms?) Director Mick Garris is a longtime King conduit (The Stand), but this one is misconceived from the start.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000G1R39E", "B00005UQ9V", "B000053UIF", "B006J8NPAE", "B00000F3SB", "B0000C2IQQ", "B000GYI340", "B00AEBB91O", "B0007WFXNA", "0767821599", "B0002A2VK0", "B00AEBB91E", "6305645574", "0792841328", "B000U1ZV6W", "B00005O439", "1573625779", "B0002OXVG4", "6305120021", "B0033HKCV4", "B00AEFYV9W", "B0001FVDQ4", "B0002O7XW2", "B0002234LS", "B00AEFXR8I", "B0010X73ZG", "B000TJ6PBK", "B00BW4S87U", "B000063US5", "B00009OWI3", "B00BTYPW7C", "B0053TWVDC", "B000068IES", "630523650X", "B0053TWV46", "B00005LQ0Q", "6304936397", "B000GBEWRU", "B00030AZCK", "B002NZK5SM", "B00006FDCD", "B00A1AU72A", "1573626910", "B000077VRT", "B00BW4S89S", "B00AKGG828", "0790742829", "B00APQLJTA", "6304604572", "B000069I05", "B005CFBZVG", "B000P0J0EM", "B00BW4S8AC", "0792846443", "B008QE9Z8A", "B003L2M584", "B00D9EJG54", "B00003CXIP", "B002BE7JEI", "B0084MVE7E", "B000H4JH7Q", "B00006FDCU", "B003Y5H5FG", "B00C0EB9EU", "B00111YM5Q", "B00006JU81", "B000RZIGUE", "B00302QF72", "B0052XU4BK", "B0000YTOL2", "B00HRCBGRA", "B002AZTYPA", "B00DII0MGI", "B0047HXMXO", "B00DTPRZ10", "B003VA3JUO", "B00005K3NR", "B00111YM56", "0792842960", "B0088749FO", "B00009QG7O", "B002GHHHG0", "B0002J4ZX2", "B002VWNIDG", "B000RIWAV2", "B000099T3M", "B0021L9MJG", "B00009PY4C", "B000KB48B6", "B00013RC7K", "B0004Z31OS", "B0014VPFT0", "B002KH4KSY", "B0013527K2", "0783228449", "B00005JOJE", "B00GNAO70K", "B000ARFPMQ", "B00AKGG6XY"], "bought_together": ["B000G1R39E", "B00000F3SB"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000063US5", "B000WQWXB6", "B00005UQ9V", "B000G1R39E"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 70362}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "JACKSON,JONATHAN", "asin": "B0007NFMB2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JPC3S43QL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Riding the Bullet (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Welsh-born actor Michael Sheen gives a flat-out bravura performance inDirty Filthy Love, as a talented man who finds his wife, job, and friends falling away when the symptoms of Tourette's Syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorder take over his life. During his downward spiral, he's spotted as a fellow sufferer by a humorous, numbers-obsessed woman (Shirley Henderson) who drafts him into her support group&#x97;at least, temporarily. A love story emerges from this, albeit an extremely offbeat one. It sometimes seems that the OCD angle is the only new thing carrying the movie, which makes it feel like a low-budget Woody Allen outing with a more severe neurotic diagnosis. Still, Henderson (Wonderland,Wilbur) is always good, the London locations are quietly atmospheric, and the stocky dynamo Sheen doesn't try to sweeten up the less savory aspects of his character. Every twitch and bark come from some specific place of anguish.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00HI4EGQA", "B0013LRKYO", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B005CA4SA6", "B00K0MM4AM", "B002LE8MP8", "B0002L57XW", "B001TH92N4", "B007XF0XZM", "B0006J240O", "B0010X73Z6", "B00080ZHEG", "B000K4X5RG"], "bought_together": ["B005CA4SA6", "B0013LRKYO"]}, "price": 9.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 227410}, "asin": "B0007Y8AEC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41FD1E2DHSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dirty Filthy Love"}
{"description": "Facing an indeterminate sentence of weeks/months/years until new episodes, fans ofThe Sopranosare advised to take the fifth; season, that is. At this point, superlatives don't doThe Sopranosjustice, but justice was at last served to this benchmark series.James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano in a not-so-nice moodFor the first time,The Sopranosrubbed outThe West Wingto take home its first Emmy&#174; for Outstanding Dramatic Series. Michael Imperioli and Drea de Matteo also earned Best Supporting Actor and Actress honors for some of their finest hours as Christopher and Adriana. From the moment a wayward bear lumbers into the Sopranos' yard in the season opener, it is clear thatThe Sopranosis in anything but a \"stagmire.\" The series benefits from an infusion of new blood, the so-called \"Class of 2004,\" imprisoned \"family\" members freshly released from jail. Most notable among these is Tony's cousin, Tony Blundetto (Steve Buscemi, who directed the pivotal season three episode \"Pine Barrens\"!  ), who initially wants to go straight, but proves himself to be something of a \"free agent,\" setting up a climactic stand-off between Tony and New York boss Johnny Sack.Carmela and TonyThese 13 mostly riveting episodes unfold with a page-turning intensity with many rich subplots. Estranged couple Tony and Carmela (the incomparable James Gandolfini and Edie Falco) work toward a reconciliation (greased by Tony's purchase of a $600,000 piece of property for Carmela to develop). The Feds lean harder on an increasingly stressed-out and distraught Adriana to \"snitch\" with inevitable results. This season's hot-button episode is \"The Test Dream,\" in which Tony is visited by some of the series' dear, and not-so-dearly, departed in a harrowing nightmare. With this set, fans can enjoy marathon viewings of an especially satisfying season, but considering the long wait ahead for season six, best to take Tony's advice to his son, who, at one point, gulps down a champagne toast. \"Slow down,\" Tony says. \"You're supposed to savor it.\"--Donald LiebensonExplore MoreFor an even deeper immersion into the world of crime (movies, that is) see our guides tocrime classicsand our who's who compendium offamous mob bosses.Bada Bing!

{"description": "My stars! The first, and perhaps most magical, season ofBewitchedstill casts an enchanting spell. For escapist fantasy, this series, no doubt inspired by the playBell, Book and Candle, broke significant television ground. The Stephens were sitcoms' first mixed marriage. Advertising executive Darrin Stephens (Dick York) was mortal, and wife Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery) was a witch. According to a retrospective segment included on this four-disc set, the Stephenses were also the first couple to sleep in one bed! And Samantha's mother, Endora (the venerable Agnes Morehead), and father, Maurice (Maurice Evans, most popularly known as Dr. Zaius in the originalPlanet of the Apes, were TV's first separated couple. Surely, Darrin did for advertising what Dick Van Dyke's Rob Petrie did for comedy writing. And nose-twitching Samantha certainly gave Mary Tyler Moore's Laura Petrie a run for the money in the sexy suburbanite sweepstakes. This high-concept series' saving grace was that Darrin insisted that Samantha not engage in any \"hocus-pocus.\" But in this first season, she would be compelled to use her extraordinary powers to right social wrongs (such as derogatory-witch stereotypes in the Halloween episode \"The Witches Are Out\"), champion the underdog (a lonely boy whose overprotective mother won't let him play baseball in \"Little Pitchers Have Big Fears\"), or to restore a troubled boy's Christmas spirit (\"A Vision of Sugar Plums\"). Or, she might just want to turn the tables on an insulting former girlfriend of Darrin's (the pilot, \"Darrin, Take This Witch, Samantha\").York and Montgomery had palpable chemistry. They also received able support by a stellar ensemble of character actors. Alice Pearce and Marion Lorne would earn Emmys for their signature roles as busybody neighbor Mrs. Kravitz and dotty Aunt Clara, respectively. George Tobias portrayed oblivious. long-suffering Abner Kravitz, with David White as Darrin's boss, Larry Tate. In today's more PC climate,Bewitchedmay offend the \"banHarry Potter\" crowd. But for baby boomers especially, this inaugural set will happily conjure up vintage television memories.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000ASDFIQ", "B000E3L7FK", "B000HIVIOM", "B000PISZ86", "B0014FAIYS", "B001LRTT30", "B00280QNKG", "B000E33VZ4", "B000HEZEYG", "B000FI8MQG", "B000RXZL0E", "B0006Z2L4W", "B0007V6IWQ", "B00LT1JKN2", "B000KLQUSK", "B00DXLO0D6", "B000TD48SI", "B0009B16TY", "B000E3L7EQ", "B00DXLO086", "B0000V4906", "B0050MB5AC", "B000291Q3Y", "B001BN4WHW", "B00A2L1CKO", "B000A0GORS", "B0009I7NH6", "B0072BNJ0I", "B0006BAWSI", "B000ASDFGI", "B000B5XOUM", "B000FSMEB0", "B008KZX7W0", "B00005JOEB", "B0006TPE1U", "B00005JLIC", "B00A2L1CJK", "B0002NY8PI", "B000291Q3O", "B000CCBCHQ", "B0007KIFK0", "B00009VRF0", "B0002I837M", "B000BITV1A", "B000EQ5PTQ", "B001E6JC30", "B000EXZFS0", "B000YKYT1M", "B00005JNS8", "B0009OUBPQ", "B000BT96OG", "B0000DFZ5O", "B0063FGERO", "B002E58FT2", "B000EQ45BU", "B00HVFA36I", "B00JU3S6IQ", "B002AMVEHY", "B001LM64VK", "B001N26GSE", "B000H6SY28", "B00AIA89OQ", "B001GMH8WE", "B008VNI9EW", "B00GOC74RU", "B000MQ4WMY", "B003PK28FM", "B000SMNK16", "B00000F61N", "B008VNI9TC", "B008L3650M", "B00DICPAMU", "B00GLT2SOA", "B000MGTQ6G", "B0002IQKAY", "B00JAD6BYW", "B002M9WW6W", "B000BYRCF6", "B0096RC57O", "B00FM4S8IU", "B000HWZ4IY", "B000A6T1J0", "B0001O3YHQ", "B001DZOCZU", "B005UL4NH0", "B00096S480", "B000LC4ZIA", "B00I458456", "B002ACKBU0", "B00008EYBH", "1589797493", "B00007KK5I", "B00HRUQB5O", "B003CNQPMY", "B0077T5SBS", "B0002JZT5U", "B000P6R9IA", "B000EBGE82", "B000ERVJKO", "B0002XVQNK"], "bought_together": ["B000ASDFIQ", "B000E3L7FK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DXLO086", "B00GOC74RU", "B0014FAIYS", "B000E3L7FK"]}, "price": 15.43, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 42875}, "asin": "B0009B16TE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KSHC6SXQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bewitched - The Complete First Season (Black and White)"}

{"description": "After the romantic courtship and the awkwardness of first dates,Once and Againin its second season settled into charting the growing relationship between fortysomethings Lily (Sela Ward) and Rick (Billy Campbell), who finally shook off all their angst and family pressures to embark on a long-term relationship. And of course, once finally committed in their love for each other, life rudely interrupts what should have been a comfortable, winding road to happily ever after. Rick's architecture firm is hand-picked for a new high-profile project, but it's dogged by community protests and run by the ever-devious Miles Drentell (David Clennon, reprising his shady character fromthirtysomething); what's more, Rick's ex-wife, Karen (Susanna Thompson), is the lawyer representing the project's opposition. Lily finds herself as the assistant to a twentysomething entrepreneur at a fledgling dot-com, and the victim of the amorous, non-professional interests of a consultant for the troubled company. She's also faced with the fate of her late father's restaurant, run by her ex-husband, Jake (Jeffrey Nordling), who's charming but not the best of businessmen, and his financial strain soon becomes hers as well. Oh, and then there are the kids: Rick's son Eli (Shane West) would rather start a band than go to college, and daughter Jessie (Evan Rachel Wood) may be anorexic; Lily's daughter Grace (Julia Whelan) falls into a friendship with a troubled girl, and only Zoe (Meredith Deane) seems to be the most normal--that is, when she isn't worried about Rick and his kids moving into her house.The course of true love never did run smooth, and truth be told, there were a bit too many plot twists cooked up for this season of the Edward Zwick-Marshall Herskovitz drama (including a hostage episode at Jake's restaurant that garnered high ratings), but the creative team behind this show managed a deft balancing act among all the characters and plotlines. Teenage angst co-existed alongside more adult worries, and the specter of professional and money troubles for both Rick and Lily kept the characters grounded in a reality not often seen in television dramas. And in addition to giving all the cast members shining moments,Once and Againdeveloped an extensive number of secondary characters, including Lily's mentally ill brother Aaron (Patrick Dempsey), Jake's flighty girlfriend Tiffany (Ever Carradine), Karen's hunky younger boyfriend (Mark Feuerstein), and an uncredited Edward Zwick as Jessie's therapist. It was the core cast, however, that madeOnce and Againsoar--teen actors West and Whelan broke their characters' stereotypical molds, the young Wood (who would go on to star inthirteen) was outstanding as she navigated blooming adolescence: Nordling and Thompson, as the exes on the periphery, were two of the best supporting actors ever on television. As always, though, Ward and Campbell were the show's heart and soul, always communicating the underlying waves of frustration and anger in their character's facades as well as the love and happiness. Despite low ratings, ABC renewedOnce and Againfor a third and final season, giving all us fans of great television (and hopeless romantics) one more year with Rick and Lily after this one.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JLFY", "B001U9BS2O", "B00JF5GAZA", "B00FR23O4U", "B00GTZWU7G", "B00GUOJJUW", "B00BGQ2NIO", "B002NN7EXS", "B00127RAGM", "B0035CVB2Q", "B001VPJYZU", "B003L77FY8", "B0077PTWHI", "B00BGQ2NDO", "B000R7HRRA", "B0018CWEVW", "B0077PTWY6", "B009LDD5MM"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLFY", "B001U9BS2O"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JLFY", "B001U9BS2O", "B000P6YNT8", "B00BMKGZVA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 58208}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 99.99, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B0009F43FY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514900S20HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Once and Again - The Complete Second Season"}

{"description": "Revelationsis a spooky, classy thriller depicting the world as a battleground between satanists and those who adhere to miracles revealing God's divine plan for humanity. Bill Pullman stars as Harvard scientist Bill Massey, whose successful quest to bring his daughter's seemingly demon-possessed serial killer to justice turns him into a well-known debunker of others who claim to speak for the Beastmaster. Problem is, the man who killed Massey's girl appears to be the real thing, endowed with prophetic powers and a second sight that comes in handy when it's time to go after the grieving hero's other child.Enter Sister Josepha (Natascha McElhone), a miracles investigator whose work is financially supported by a famous billionaire but disowned by the Vatican. Josepha has been led to Massey through a brain-dead girl who, though medically impossible, quotes scripture and has drawn a map to his office. Despite his skepticism, Massey teams with the nun in search of a kidnapped baby who may very well be the Christ-child in His just-in-time-for-Armageddon second coming. Written by David Seltzer (Dragonfly), and directed by occasionalBuffyhelmer David Semel and Lili Fini Zanuck (Rush),Revelationshas an appealing vitality (especially when Massey and Sister Josepha become targets for assassins), a nice Hollywood gloss, and an unsettling air of mystery, as if angels and demons really are duking it out for dominion of the Earth right under our noses.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002XNT1C", "B002UNXS68", "B000051S4T", "B0009JE6G6", "B0038N9X22", "B00175GAHE", "B000GFLEKY", "B0051GOB2G", "B002H6NVOC", "B0002S94BQ", "B00005UF7J", "B00D6I7HH2", "B00008IAKP", "B0037AGB9O", "B002TVQ4C6", "B00JF5GAZA", "B0009JE6FM", "B000E5N6B6", "B000N3T0EG", "B008B49F4Y", "B000087F10", "B0036EH3UC", "B008ZRKIQ6", "B000GYI340", "B0012IX35S", "B00AQSN620", "B00023BKMC", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B004LROMS4", "B00005JM39", "B003PGNBO8", "B00006IUGH", "B004RUEXVQ", "B001CQONMC", "B008L0YN22", "B000MMMTD2", "B000FJH5M2", "B00277Q2U6", "B000051S4V", "B007VJ5D14", "B00DPUB56U", "B000FOPPBA", "B00720OO0S", "B002T7X4UK", "B00E0KWBAI", "B001HUWQEA", "B00E3QJ7JC", "B00IWTVDXO", "B0001WTVUW", "B0024FAR66", "B000NJL4QC", "B007I1Q4W2", "B00BBE962W", "B007Q0JJIQ", "B00005R5GL", "B00B4804LM", "1450700551", "B002Z2X7GU", "B002JVWR4U", "B00061QJSK", "B0017IVHHO", "B000I0QLQY", "B00000K3TO", "B00062IDEW", "B001715A92", "B00007GZYC", "B000FSMEB0", "B000BNI90Y", "B000056HP5", "B001CFEBW0", "B000OHZJSC", "B00B04NIZO", "6305718954", "B00003CXQA", "B00AFEYS9A", "B00466H3A4", "B003UCA4XI", "B00803PFXG", "B001GKJ2E8", "0780622561", "B0085A9HU6", "B0081QF6Q8", "B002ZCY872", "B000PMFS2I", "B0002V7OI8", "B000CNE0SS", "B00070FX5U", "B0026ZQBK0", "B0009WFF8Q", "B000A2XAPK"], "bought_together": ["B0002XNT1C", "B00175GAHE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000051S4T", "B000087F10", "B00175GAHE", "B000B82TIC"]}, "price": 13.32, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 61072}, "asin": "B0009NCQGY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZWHFX3MSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Revelations"}

Lolita's father is a writer whose fame has made him so self-centered he has no clue the effect his egotistical behavior has on everyone around him. Now that she has grown up, Lolita becomes even more determined to make him notice her - especially since she's discovered a talent of her own and would like his approval. There are people who she thinks willhelp her, but she always winds up competing against them for her father's attention. And when she meets a guy who likes her for herself, Lolita finds she may actually be more like her father than shewould ever have imagined.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00009OOFG", "B0002C4JIK", "B0000C9JFO", "B0002S64SM", "B0007WQHDU", "B000296E7W", "B0001IN0MQ", "1585103942", "B002AG2NTI", "B000GBEWP2", "B001THZAAI", "B00005UQA2", "1585104043", "B0087IT8FK", "B0000A1HQP", "B0045ZAQRI", "B00005NB9Z", "B000N3T0DW", "B0007A61K6", "B00HRJVHEK", "B000YAA68W", "B00421IR5I", "B004B3254Q", "B0083V2W18", "B004ZJHSAM", "B00005JPX8", "B0069UV0AY", "B00005Y727", "B000OVLBGC", "B0009WFFWC", "B005E7SEK2", "1585102687", "B000UAE7MM", "158510258X", "B005V4X8PO", "B0084O26SI", "B00005UW7I", "B004SEUIXS", "1572524898", "158510275X", "B000HC2LTO", "B000Q7ZL4M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000C9JFO", "B0007WQHDU", "B0087IT8FK", "1585103942"]}, "price": 6.22, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 196142}, "asin": "B0009S4J1E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P5NWD70GL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Look at Me"}

{"description": "He pops pills, watches soaps, and always, always says what's on his mind. He's Dr. Gregory House (Emmy nominee Hugh Laurie,Blackadder). Producers David Shore, Bryan Singer, Katie Jacobs, and Paul Attanasio haven't rewritten the hospital drama--at heart, it's a cross betweenSt. Elsewhere,ER, andC.S.I.--but they've infused a moribund genre with new life and created one of TV's most compelling characters. More than any previous medical procedural, it resembles Attanasio&#x92;s underratedGideon's Crossing, butHouseis lighter on its feet. As fascinating as he is, the show wouldn't work as well if it were all House all the time (that would be like Sherlock Holmes without Watson or Moriarty). Fortunately, he's joined by an intriguing cast of characters, portrayed by a combination of experienced vets (Omar Epps, Lisa Edelstein, Tony winner Robert Sean Leonard) and new faces (Jennifer Morrison, Jesse Spencer). Aside from the complicated cases they tackle each week, the sparks really fly when House's brilliant, if na&#xEF;ve charges are put to the test--and as the head of a teaching hospital, it's his job to test them (although his tough love approach is constantly landing him in hot water with Edelstein's administrator). From the first episode,Houseattracted a talented array of guests, including Robin Tunney (\"Pilot\"), Joe Morton (\"Role Model\"), and Patrick Bauchau (\"Cursed\") as Spencer&#x92;s father. In addition, Chi McBride and Sela Ward appear frequently (with Ward returning for the second season). Viewers who first watched these 22 episodes on Fox will be gratified to note that the music has survived the transition to disc, such as the Rolling Stones' \"You Can't Always Get What You Want,\" as featured in both the pilot and season finale (\"Honeymoon\"). The only apparent omission is the credit theme (Massive Attack's \"Teardrop\") from the pilot.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Movie studios, by and large, avoid controversial subjects like race the way you might avoid a hive of angry bees. So it's remarkable thatCrasheven got made; that it's a rich, intelligent, and moving exploration of the interlocking lives of a dozen Los Angeles residents--black, white, latino, Asian, and Persian--is downright amazing. A politically nervous district attorney (Brendan Fraser) and his high-strung wife (Sandra Bullock, biting into a welcome change of pace fromMiss Congeniality) get car-jacked by an oddly sociological pair of young black men (Larenz Tate and Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges); a rich black T.V. director (Terrence Howard) and his wife (Thandie Newton) get pulled over by a white racist cop (Matt Dillon) and his reluctant partner (Ryan Phillipe); a detective (Don Cheadle) and his Latina partner and lover (Jennifer Esposito) investigate a white cop who shot a black cop--these are only three of the interlocking stories that reach up and down class lines. Writer/director Paul Haggis (who wrote the screenplay forMillion Dollar Baby) spins every character in unpredictable directions, refusing to let anyone sink into a stereotype. The cast--ranging from the famous names above to lesser-known but just as capable actors like Michael Pena (Buffalo Soldiers) and Loretta Devine (Woman Thou Art Loosed)--meets the strong script head-on, delivering galvanizing performances in short vignettes, brief glimpses that build with gut-wrenching force.

{"description": "Sherlock Holmes and the Case of the Silk Stockingis an excellent Sherlockian pastiche, i.e., part of a genre of original works featuring Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's most beloved character, but taking various liberties Doyle most likely would not have embraced. Rupert Everett gives a wholly original performance as Holmes--not an easy thing to do in the shadow of Jeremy Brett'sdefinitive portrayalon Britain's Granada Television in the 1980s. Both Everett and the story capture Holmes during his most dissolute period, hooked on opiates, refusing to eat, and more often than not without the company of his friend, Dr. Watson (Ian Hart, essaying the character a second time), who had left Baker Street to pursue a private practice and marry his second wife. This is Holmes deep in the career crisis eventually resolved by his duel with Moriarty in Doyle's canon, but inThe Case of the Silk Stockingthe Great Detective is vexed by a murderer preying upon the daughters of London aristocrats. Elements of the killer's sexual fetishism make this a particularly grim tale that the discreet Watson would most certainly not have chronicled. The dark but imaginative tale is lightened a bit by the presence of Watson's fiancee (Helen McCrory), an American psychiatrist as aghast as she is impressed by Holmes' lack of emotional attachment to his work.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000797E7", "B002Q3MYA8", "B008L0YN22", "B0000CERP3", "B0036BDQ7Y", "B003NF97NA", "B0044LYRGO", "B000EXZFRG", "B0048NRQH0", "B004D8P244", "B006WNSHZO", "B002SRNNRU", "B004ZEDJLY", "B002VJ0576", "B001TE6P78", "B000BBOUGI", "B000FVQLWA", "B0000AUHPC", "B005ETAMHS", "B000BRBABK", "B000R349HK", "B00HUAGYF8", "B0024EWPE4", "B002OQZE6S", "B00062IVJE", "B00347AIOE", "B000E6ESJ4", "B00JJRLFVS", "B000RPCJB6", "B002EOVXAG", "B00FRQ0HOQ", "B002K0WBT6", "B0045ZAQPA", "B0002HODE0", "B00007H5C8", "B00015HVN8", "B000B7QCKY", "B00DUX28ZE", "B000062XEY", "B00B5A9FNM", "B001V7YZE8", "B002EOVXAQ", "B000NOKJEA", "B00DC5JZTW", "B000062XDX", "B002OQZE6I", "B005G172Q8", "B00GWXI1F0", "B00331RHDG", "B00CTWSGA8", "B00E3UN44W", "085768776X", "B002OMIKV8", "B00I458456", "B00K6D1RVW", "B00BY0EBK0", "B00GD7UMDO", "B00HGE90Z4", "B004VLYHNA", "B0000ARD7O", "B00AATGDUC", "B000GH3Q94", "B00112983G", "0470484446", "B0013K1AK0", "B00GZ0NSLW", "B00EV1YZD2", "B004AV5H3U", "B003X82D1K", "B00D49YE4W", "B00008G8CZ", "0890090572", "B00C888LOO", "B003UAKECG", "B00383XZP8", "B00CDV4OEC", "B000053VAT", "B000YDMPCO", "B001H9JBW6", "B00BQXTCVS", "B003N1Z70Q", "B002WY65UQ", "B007K7IBTI", "B00009WVO2", "B00GWXHYPI", "B004GSVXDA", "B006OB3K56", "B001KZOVJK", "B00CL151G4", "B00BGARGR8", "B00006JDU8", "B00GAXASLC", "B0002JP44G", "B00008K772", "B00CBJ53HS", "B00BOTCJXC", "B0047CG95W", "B000060MVK", "B006K1WGQY", "B000W4TGIQ"], "bought_together": ["B0000797E7", "B002Q3MYA8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003NF97NA", "B0036BDQ7Y", "B000BBOUGI", "B004ZEDJLY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 80482}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 4.98, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000AOEMVY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z2KC9J91L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sherlock Holmes and the Case of the Silk Stocking"}

{"description": "With Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson as a pair of brazen wedding crashers, this buddy/romantic comedy milks a few big laughs from its foolproof premise. Under the direction of David Dobkin (who previously worked with Wilson onShanghai Knights), the movie ranges from bawdy romp to mushy romance, and that tonal identity crisis curtails the overall hilarity. But when the well-teamed costars are firing on all pistons with fast-paced dialogue and manic situations, belly laughs are delivered at a steady clip. Things get complicated when the guys infiltrate the family of the Treasury Secretary (Christopher Walken), resulting in a romantic pair-off between Vaughn and the congressman's oversexed daughter Gloria (Isla Fisher) while Wilson sincerely woos another daughter, Claire (Rachel McAdams), who's unhappily engaged to an Ivy League cheater (Bradley Cooper). Walken is more or less wasted in his role, but Jane Seymour and Henry Gibson make amusing appearances, and a surprise guest arrives late in the game for some over-the-top scene-stealing. It's all a bit uneven, but McAdams (considered by some to be \"the next Julia Roberts\") is a pure delight, and with enough laughs to make it easily recommended,Wedding Crasherswill likely find its place on DVD shelves alongside other flawed but enjoyable R-rated comedies that embrace a naughtier, nastier brand of humor with no need for apologies.--Jeff ShannonVince Vaughn's MoviesWhy We Love Rachel McAdamsOwen Wilson's MoviesThe SoundtrackThe Return of Crass ComedyThe 40-Year-Old Virgin", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFYS2M", "B000ELJAEM", "B00466HN7M", "B008R65XNS", "B00005JNZU", "B00006FMUW", "B000J4P9P8", "B002ZGW92E", "B001G5T6GW", "B000WZEZGI", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B00003CXSM", "B001TUZD8O", "B000HCPS94", "B001C0JCBA", "B0009HBPN0", "B001OD4S50", "B00005JMYI", "B00005JG6N", "B004EPZ084", "B0015I2RT8", "B00AEFYAMA", "B00AEBB8NS", "B00AEFXJS6", "B000069CF0", "B000TZJBPQ", "B00003CXO1", "B001C5LLQ4", "B0009OL7Z4", "B0007RT9M6", "B00005JMW7", "B001J9KJ4I", "B0006GANPA", "B003Y5H574", "B000BKJ762", "B000E6EHE0", "B003Y5H524", "B000ICM5X0", "B00AEFY7I2", "B002K0WBXW", "B00AEBB9K0", "B000VXWX7E", "B0013D8LHC", "B004HO6I2E", "B001DPHDB0", "B0016MOV92", "B00AEFYM2S", "B004EPZ070", "B000JJ4DNW", "B003CRM6PA", "B00BEIYMZ6", "B008R65XMO", "B00005JMX6", "B00AEBBA2C", "B004EPZ06G", "B004EPYZS0", "B003Y5H5B0", "B00024JC4E", "B0000AKCKI", "B000957O82", "B00AEFYQE2", "B00DV2MVWO", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B001L9EXTS", "B0041KKYGU", "B00AEFZ3XU", "B002U4UYZA", "B000CPH9PM", "B000EMGJAO", "B000M341QE", "B008R65XUQ", "B00005JMCT", "B001AKTZW8", "B00008WJD6", "B00AEFYSL8", "B002P413IC", "B00AEFXVW0", "B002ZG99H2", "B0000A02TZ", "B005LAII12", "B001SN78JO", "B008JFUORW", "B000LC3ICE", "B002T9H2LA", "B0051MKNRC", "B003HKN52U", "B000CCBCAS", "B00AEFYZCU", "B002ZG980U", "B00AEFY99O", "B002VWNIEA", "B0000524E5", "B004AV5GX6", "B000A343RI", "B000EMGJ7C", "B004LWZW5G", "B00AEFXDO6", "B00000K3UU", "B004SIP95G", "B0009RCPUW"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFYS2M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00466HN7M", "B001G5T6GW", "B003Y5H5B0", "B000J4P9P8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 92528}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.95, "brand": "New Line Home Video", "asin": "B000BKVQRU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z2E7093FL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wedding Crashers (R-Rated Widescreen Edition)"}

Midway through the 21st century, Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) lives in a confined indoor community after ongoing abuse of the Earth has rendered most of the planet uninhabitable. One of the only places in the outside world still capable of sustaining life is an idyllic island where citizens are chosen to live through a lottery. Or at least that's what Lincoln and his fellow citizens are taught to believe; the truth is that Lincoln, like everyone he knows, is actually a clone who is kept under wraps to provide needed organs when the person who supplied his or her DNA falls ill. When he becomes aware that his existence is a fraud, Lincoln escapes to the outside world with a fellow clone, Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson), though the powers that be are determined to see that no one gets away alive.The Islandalso stars Steve Buscemi, Djimon Hounsou, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Sean Bean.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767805712", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B0069UP2PI", "B00005JL78", "B0013PSTMC", "B004LWZW7E", "B004XQO90O", "B008JFUO36", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B00AEFXCLU", "B001GCUO02", "B0001NBNDY", "B002GIBVVG", "B00KHWSB5M", "B0018O4YT0", "B00005JLWN", "B0001CNRAM", "B002ZG98SW", "B00005JN0T", "B00K7IPFSM", "B00JPFTX5O", "B0009YA3OA", "B001CC7PLM", "B000AP04FG", "B005LAIIMG", "B005LAII8A", "B0013LL2Z2", "B002ZG980U", "B008JFUN50", "B00005JMWP", "B000EQHXNW", "B004WCTLNY", "B004EPYZOO", "B001GKJ2E8", "B007R6DJP8", "B00AEFXSLE", "B00AKGG8I2", "B000EZ908Y", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00BEIYIF0", "B0045HCJ8A", "B004LWZW4M", "B000BVM1S2", "B0067EKYAY", "B00AEBB8NI", "B001FB55HQ", "B00005JPAR", "B004LWZW42", "B001VLBDD0", "B0062P3392", "B000FS9FCG", "B008JFUPFI", "B00IKM5MIA", "B004A8ZX28", "B000056PMU", "B00005JPD0", "B005COLETU", "B003Q6D2B4", "B004EPYZSK", "B000P0J0EW", "B009AMAJPA", "B002SG7Z7A", "B00H83EUQW", "B000LC55F2", "B00DWZHTOU", "B005NKIPUY", "B005LAIHPE", "B000A2IPQY", "B00AEBB89W", "B0051MKNV8", "B005LAIIPS", "B001EAWMGA", "B00A7MSQRK", "6304711891", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B002GHHHOC", "B0021L8V0M", "B000P0I4O4", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AS1Q93S", "B00004XPPG", "B0045HCJFS", "B003UYUQZW", "B001OQCVI8", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00096S49Y", "B005LAIGRS", "B000EGDB10", "B002ZG984Q", "B000FGGE68", "B003L20IG0", "B0036TGSR6", "B0045HCJGC", "B002DU39GW", "B0002KVUKM", "B008JFUQZ2", "B000H30B2C", "0767803434", "B00AEBB8QK"], "bought_together": ["0767805712", "B0069UP2PI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004WCTLNY", "B004XQO90O", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B004SBQAN8"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 95555}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.44, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B000BO0LH2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5133H8SZ04L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Island"}

{"description": "In his third feature, director Noah Baumbach scores a triumph with an autobiographical coming-of-age story about a teenager whose writer-parents are divorcing.  The father (Jeff Daniels) and mother (Laura Linney) duke it out in half-civilized, half-savage fashion, while their two sons adapt in different ways, shifting allegiances between parents.  The film is squirmy-funny and nakedly honest about the rationalizations and compensatory snobbisms of artistic failure as well as the conflicted desires of adolescents for sex and status.  In detailing bohemian-bourgeois life in brownstone Brooklyn, Baumbach is spot on.  Everyone proceeds from good intentions and acts rather badly, in spite or because of their manifest intelligence.  Fulfilling the best traditions of the American independent film, this quirky, wisely written feature explores the gulf between sexes, generations, art and commerce, Brooklyn and Manhattan.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767821408", "6305428239", "B0010X8NF0", "B0000640VJ", "B0007UC8Y4", "B001QOGYBI", "B002ZG97T2", "B0011NVC8Y", "B007L6VR12", "B000FUF7DA", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B0006TPE4C", "B00005JLX8", "B00007AJF8", "B00005JLRE", "B0014GI6I2", "B00000G02H", "B001P3SA8K", "B004SEUIW4", "B003102JDM", "B00005JMJG", "B00H9HZITU", "B0024HH2WG", "081099741X", "B0081FSMII", "B00005JMJ4", "B003Q7B7CO", "B001E95ZNS", "B00EO2I6SI", "B003L20ICE", "B008220DGE", "B002ZG97TC", "B0035G5IOE", "B009B8YZCQ", "B000C20VVE", "B007L6VR6M", "B0083V2W4U", "B003KGBIS4", "B00003CXQ4", "B000K7VHQE", "B000E33VWW", "B000BX8R1A", "B007UW9W32", "B00003CWTI", "B003N82OP0", "B008Y1YJMM", "B001HN699A", "B000M4RG7E", "B00AEFY8MM", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00GMV8KGW", "B000M5B98A", "B005LAIGF0", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B00JAQJNN0", "B00J5LXQKQ", "B00005AUJK", "B003UESJLU", "B00005Q4CS", "1572527005", "B0016MJ6HY", "B001UV4XGU", "B0089XJXRQ", "B002AFX53M", "B003U6SJYU", "B00IXPQU6M", "B00CIOD6HK", "B001UV4XUG", "B0045O2PHS", "B00007976U", "B005HK13SG", "B000PAAJZ6", "B00606P0BM", "B0002DB52M", "B001DJ7PR8", "B00AEFYSWM", "B004UVYQVY", "B00004XPP8", "B002LVVCJY", "0802867189", "0830827048", "B00008K7AO", "B00D3LA5WG", "B0012E2GFK", "B001CW7ZT4", "B0007OCG5G", "B00005JLSK", "B00AG4760C", "B000FVQM2Y", "0809141183", "0830828052", "B004UXUX4Q", "B000CNESTE", "0205827195", "B00008DP4C", "6304907729", "B005PTMPYA", "B00003CXDJ", "B0042U9B3G", "B0008JIJ10"], "bought_together": ["0767821408", "6305428239"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007UC8Y4", "B0010X8NF0", "B0000640VJ", "0767821408"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 67820}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.54, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000CS464G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q2MVZ5QRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Squid and the Whale (Special Edition)"}

{"description": "Michael Winterbottom is no stranger to literary adaptation. BothJudeandThe Claimwere drawn from works by Thomas Hardy. Nor is the versatile filmmaker a stranger to the post-modern romp, like24 Hour Party People. In that paean to Manchester&#x92;s music scene, Steve Coogan was Factory honcho Tony Wilson. In Winterbottom's take on Laurence Sterne's digressiveThe Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman, the prolific helmer combines literature with lunacy and brings Coogan back as the titular character--and then some. Coogan doesn&#x92;t just portray the 18th century squire, but his father Walter and insecure actor \"Steve Coogan.\" It's a film about the making of a film, effortlessly shifting between Tristram&#x92;s tumultuous birth and his frustrated adulthood--bogged down in the writing of his life story--and between fiction and (what appears to be) fact. There are no end to the worries on and off the set: Coogan worries his heels aren't high enough, Rob Brydon worries his teeth are too yellow, and Coogan's girlfriend (Kelly Macdonald) worries she isn't seeing enough of him. It may sound like Spike Jonze&#x92;sAdaptation, but in spirit, it more closely resembles Tony Richardson&#x92;sTom Jones. Coogan and his co-stars, particularly Naomie Harris as the ultimate film nut, Gillian Anderson as the American brought in to boost the project's profile, and Brydon as Tristram&#x92;s Uncle Toby are as game for the challenge as their fearless leader. Consequently,Tristram Shandyisn&#x92;t just one of Winterbottom&#x92;s best films--it's one of theyear&#x92;s best.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Cheri Oteri breathed bracing fresh air into the seasons she appeared onSaturday Night Live, and created memorable characters both absurd and delightful. This 78-minute disc contains samples of some of her signature performances, including the preternaturally peppy cheerleader, Arianna, paired with a strapping Will Ferrell. (Ever tried to lead a cheer at the team's&#x85;swim meet? Arianna never met a challenge she couldn't conquer.)  Oteri also takes on media icon Barbara Walters, satirized decades earlier by the incomparable Gilda Radner as Baba Wawa. Oteri's impersonation both pays homage to Radner's and takes it to a new level of absurdity; Oteri's Walters is a randy, name-dropping old coot who doesn't miss a beat--or an opportunity to aggrandize herself (\"I was horseback riding the other day with Saddam Hussein&#x85;\"). Don't miss the brief skit where Walters tries to have phone sex with a nonplussed Tom Brokaw. Other signature characters include Oteri's Judge Judy and the prescription hound Collette (appearing here in a priceless bit with John Goodman as a flummoxed pharmacist). And of course, the abusive Burger Castle counter chick Nadeen, who shoots down every customer request with a \"Simma down, now!\" Extras include audition and dress rehearsal footage, and an audio commentary by Oteri.--A.T.

{"description": "An independent film from Britain,On a Clear Daytells the story of a man trying to come to terms with his past by setting a goal for the future: to swim across the English Channel. Frank (Peter Mullan) is a stoic man who tells his young grandson, \"Things aren't meant to be fixed nowadays.\" After working all his life, the Glasgow shipbuilder finds himself middle-aged and jobless. His loving wife Joan (two-time Academy Award nominee Brenda Blethyn) tries to lessen the financial burden by learning to become a bus driver. Frank's relationship with his househusband son Rob (Jamie Sives) is distant at best. And though he doesn't speak of his other son, who drowned decades ago, Frank thinks of him often. Director Gaby Dellal reveals a gentle touch in the film's quieter moments. But she's just at home balancing the melodramatic moments (Rob confronting his father in a swimming pool) with comic relief (Frank's friendship with a woebegone group of men, including optimistic Danny, played by Billy Boyd fromThe Lord of the Rings). In the end, it's less important whether Frank's goals are met than mending his broken relationships. The finale is touching in the way it all plays out, because some things are meant to be fixed.--Jae-Ha Kim", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000CS45TW", "B00003CXMY", "B0009A1BW2", "B0001I55M4", "B00000ILEC", "B000CDGVPI", "B00000F3FS", "B0009PBLU4", "B00007K02D", "B0009G3BCY", "B00004TJKJ", "6305428557", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B004IY6A0S", "B0080QOL10", "B00AZMFO6I", "B0000CE684", "B000BITVAG", "B005S9EJ14", "B001FES0JI", "B00HHYF5DE", "B00HQOD0SM", "B00GPWEPZ8", "B00005V1WP", "B007A2O3FO", "B00FPPQYXM", "B0000714BW", "B0018M6J90", "B000N4SHOE", "B004D45NYC", "B004SIP7D0", "B00000IQC5", "B002TZS58I", "B00009IB1D", "B000ETRCN0", "B00H9LHVHI", "B0050N0US4", "B000LPS34E", "630560097X", "B00003CXC9", "B00H7KJRVY", "B000OCY7JO", "B00404ME1A", "B009T6CXG0", "B004P7CNZO", "6305692696", "B000E1ZBGS", "B007TBJUVI", "B0008ENFWI", "B0080QOKYS", "6305622914", "B00JJRLFTU", "B00005JKNF", "B00GWXI1F0", "B00G7QPXAI", "B00005JOFQ", "B003LL3FIY", "B0002DRDY6", "B009ERJZP6", "B00GOC756A", "B0015OKWKI", "B00DX88IBO", "B005SW2RTC", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B004XYOQU4", "B00BEIYM42", "B003UESJFQ", "B005OZVXCU", "B004XVMCMQ", "6305428395", "B007K7IBTI", "B00ECW9XEG", "0800141660", "B00H4ZEFTQ", "B0080QOL1A", "B001VC99HQ", "B00G6HO368", "B000NOIX48", "B004SIP7I0", "B008PDAENC", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00CDV4NAM", "B0068MNO2U", "B00D7AM2WO", "B00F1BFRA6", "B002JCSWV6", "B004SEUJOQ", "B00003CXPD", "B00G15MDI0", "B00005YUNK", "0767020308", "B004XVMCQ2", "B009ERK0SW", "B005CFBZX4", "0788815490", "B004JMSIQS", "B000F1IQN2", "B008B9JTFO", "B000NIVJFY", "B0000ARD7O"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXMY", "B00000ILEC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00ECW9XEG", "B00003CXMY", "B0001I55M4", "B00000ILEC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 83483}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.14, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

{"description": "Forget any off-screen impressions you may have of Mel Gibson, and experience Apocalypto as the mad, bloody runaway train that it is. The story is set in the pre-Columbian Maya population: one village is brutally overrun, its residents either slaughtered or abducted, by a ruling tribe that needs slaves and human sacrifices. We focus on the capable warrior Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), although Gibson skillfully sketches a whole population of characters--many of whom don't survive the early reels. Most of the film is set in the dense jungle, but the middle section, in a grand Mayan city, is a dazzling triumph of design, costuming, and sheer decadent terror. The movie itself is a triumph of brutality, as Gibson lets loose his well-established fascination with bodily mortification in a litany of assaults including impalement, evisceration, snakebite, and bee stings. It's a dark, disgusted vision, but Gibson doesn't forget to apply some very canny moviemaking instincts to the violence--including the creation of a tremendous pair of villains (strikingly played by Raoul Trujillo and Rodolfo Palacias). The film is in a Maya dialect, subtitled in English, and shot on digital video (which occasionally betrays itself in some blurry quick pans). Amidst all the mayhem, nothing in the film is more devastating than a final wordless exchange of looks between captured villager Blunted (Jonathan Brewer) and his wife's mother (Maria Isabel Diaz), a superb change in tone from their early relationship. Yes, this is an obsessive, crazed movie, but Gibson knows what he's doing. --Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000UVV24M", "B0012Q732O", "B00003CXAF", "B001BNFRB2", "B000VMIILU", "1573623903", "B002O3Z50Q", "B00004XPPG", "6305692688", "B00028HBKM", "B00004RJ71", "B00AEFXKUI", "B002ZG999U", "B0002YLCG0", "B000VKL6ZM", "B002T9H2LA", "B0000542C6", "B0001CNQX0", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00006ADD5", "B00406UK7S", "B004AOECXI", "B004SIP8W0", "B000R9U3B0", "B00008G8LY", "B00001ZWUS", "B000MGB6NM", "B003EYVXXW", "6304711905", "B004HO6HWA", "B000QXDED6", "B0034G4P58", "B0000714BS", "B000XR9L50", "B00005JLQT", "0783230389", "B002VWNIEA", "B00AZNEW5G", "B008MIMWQW", "B003VA3JZY", "B0002DRDIW", "B000AARKOO", "B00BEJL6JK", "B004SIP7TE", "079283366X", "B00005V9HH", "B000M341QE", "B003HKN52U", "B005IUIXCE", "B00275EGWY", "B003UYUQZW", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002O3Z510", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B002WY65VU", "B000I0RNWU", "B00003CXWV", "B002XMGGK6", "B003NF97NK", "B000QXDCJ2", "B001FB5634", "B001DZOC6Y", "B007STBUHI", "B0000VCZMK", "B0013FDM7E", "B00015YVDG", "B003IY498Y", "6305433925", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005K3NR", "B000O76ZQC", "B003ELKNH2", "B00018D3ZA", "6304821832", "B00AEBBA36", "B009YQJ322", "B00005JL3T", "079284646X", "B002CA68MU", "B00BTYJYR6", "B00AEFYE08", "B000P0J09C", "B005LAIHPE", "B00441GZ1Y", "B001OQCV2E", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000BITV9W", "B004LWZW4M", "B005LAIIRQ", "B00003CXBH", "B000A2WP7O", "B001GCUO0W", "B00005JPD0", "B00AMSLDTM", "B000RTB0R6", "B00005JA8B", "B00009PY4G", "0783226039", "B000B8QG22", "B000069I1I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001BNFRB2", "B00028HBKM", "B00001ZWUS", "B00004XPPG"]}, "price": 10.55, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 53938}, "asin": "B000GNOKQG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41yXQu76-NL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Apocalypto (2006) (2007) Rudy Youngblood; Raoul Trujillo; Mel Gibson"}

{"description": "Aliaswas a show that constantly reinvented itself. And its fifth and final season was no exception, as the creative team behind the espionage show worked to pull together the labyrinthine plot elements that had existed over the years, as well as tailor the show around the pregnancy of star Jennifer Garner. The results were somewhat tinged with melancholy as everything was wrapped up, but also had a maturity and respect for its characters--which is not to say thatAliaslacked in action. In fact, the season started out with a literal bang, as a truck slammed into the car carrying Sydney Bristow (Garner) and her co-worker and lover Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan), right after Vaughn had made a mind-blowing revelation to Sydney. What followed was a mind-trippingly enticing blend of fake identities, false fronts, blind alleys, and new characters with dubious intentions, with the importance of the enigmatic Rambaldi device hanging over it all. Just another day at the office forAlias, you say? Not this time--for long-time fans of the shows, the true natures of all characters would finally be revealed, and Sydney would at long last discover the powers of the dreaded Rambaldi device, as well as who was behind the machinations to obtain it for world domination.WhatAliasdid best was mix its outlandish plotlines with accessible characters who were more than just pieces on an espionage game board. The final season did have a few false starts, as it juggled the departure (and reappearance) of established characters and the introduction of new ones, but by the time it had reached its 100th episode, \"There's Only One Sydney Bristow,\" battle lines were drawn as the core characters hurtled toward the show's conclusion. Not to be too cryptic, but the less you know the better, as part of the fun is puzzling out who's doing what to whom; suffice it to say that the ever-capable Garner, along with Victor Garber and Ron Rifkin as the dueling father figures in her life, laid a groundwork of personal drama that held the show together amidst all the shootouts, tech gadgets and costume changes. While (literally) everyone from Sydney's past made an appearance in the show's 100th episode (including an outstanding turn by Bradley Cooper as Syd's erstwhile friend Will), there were a couple great additions too: Rachel Nichols made a fetching Syd-in-training while Amy Acker, who played the daffy good-girl Fred onAngel, was a menacing and captivating adversary. We will answer one question for die-hardAliasfans: Yes, Lena Olin does return as the lethal Irina Derevko.

{"description": "In addition to spawning the popularNaked Gunmovie franchise,Police Squad!had a lasting impact on TV comedy, and it's still a guilty pleasure. Hot from the success ofAirplane!two years earlier, the ZAZ team (brothers David and Jerry Zucker and writing partner Jim Abrahams) decided to spoof TV cop shows, using the late '50s Lee Marvin seriesM Squadand the popular series format of Quinn Martin Productions (e.g.,The Streets of San Francisco) as their template for supremely silly, gag-laden satire. WithAirplane!star Leslie Nielsen as straight-faced detective Frank Drebin and Alan North as Drebin's befuddled boss, Capt. Ed Hocken, this half-hour series quickly established an irresistible combination of nonstop sight gags, non sequiturs, and repeated routines (\"Cigarette?\" \"Yes, it is\") that dared viewers to pay close attention or miss the laughs if they didn't. Ironically, this very quality--you had to actuallywatchthe show instead of casually listening for punchlines--is what ultimately sealed the series' fate. After only six poorly rated episodes,Police Squad!was canceled without fanfare, and six years passed before Drebin returned as the bumbling hero ofThe Naked Gun.Will all six episodes on one DVD, ZAZ fans can get reacquainted with a series that was arguably ahead of its time. In addition to the rib-tickling disparity between onscreen episode titles and narrated titles, and \"special guest stars\" (including William Shatner, Robert Goulet, Lorne Greene, and others) who get killed in the opening credits, loyal viewers could count on a weekly dose of hilarity from Nielsen, North, and their supporting players. Character actor William Duell appeared each week as shoeshine boy \"Johnny the Snitch,\" capable of answering literallyanyquestion if you repeatedly greased his palm (a gag that led to info-seeking cameo appearances by Dick Clark, Dr. Joyce Brothers, baseball manager Tommy Lasorda, and others). And while originalMission: Impossiblecostar Peter Lupus poked fun at himself as the dim-witted Det. Norberg (later played by O.J. Simpson in theNaked Gunmovies), Ed Williams--an actual high school science teacher--is hilarious as \"Mr. Wizard\"-like lab technician Ted Olson, who dispenses dubious science lessons to unsuspecting children. The fast-paced barrage of humor guaranteed that every episode would deliver as many hits as misses, and while some of the jokes have lost their punch,Police Squad!still delivers the belly-laughs... and always will, as long as humans have an appetite for shameless stupidity.--Jeff ShannonOn the DVDTwo episode commentaries by the Zucker brothers, Jim Abrahams, and producer Robert K. Weiss are good for a laugh, as the ZAZ team laughs at their own material and recalls the rigors of a 5-day shooting schedule, battles with network censors (also outlined in the revealing \"Production Memo Highlights\" feature), and the never-shown \"celebrity guest death\" of John Belushi, who actually died shortly after the gag was filmed. Comedian and writer Robert Wuhl's commentary is more autobiographical and somewhat perfunctory (he barely remembers the episode he wrote), but contains a few nuts-and-bolts details about the show's production. The 10-minute Leslie Nielsen interview shows the gracefully aging star in fine form as he recalls his affinity for the ZAZ brand of humor; the brief gag reel offers about a dozen on-set bloopers (several from crude workprint sources); \"Behind the Freeze Frames\" is an extended outtake to illustrate the elaborately faked \"freeze frame\" gag that ended each episode; and \"Celebrity Death Shots\" is a list of guest-star death gags proposed (and mostly used) for the series. Also included are casting tests for Alan North and Ed Williams, and an animated producers' photo gallery ofPolice Squad!sets, props, and scenery.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AJCUL1C", "B00AMSQBUI", "6305428263", "B00AMSQBRQ", "B005NKIPUO", "B001Q8MMC4", "B0001ZX0O2", "B00005V5NQ", "B000K405CY", "B0006FO578", "B00BTYFWEA", "B00AEFXDAK", "1558908412", "6305268797", "B00LT1JHLW", "B002GOAGYI", "B00AEFXDO6", "B002GSXKPG", "0792166523", "B0000A02TY", "B002GSXKOC", "079073849X", "B00AEFYP3E", "B00LNBQ8SI", "6305840083", "B00LNBQ8UG", "B00AEFYPAC", "B000A6T1KY", "B000F7CMPE", "B00L326LTI", "B00008EY6Q", "0792166493", "B00L9K2EGS", "B0001Z4OXS", "B000PHX5MI", "B000065U1D", "B001666484", "0792844890", "B00441GYQ0", "B000G6BLW4", "B00008972V", "B001E0O8DA", "B0019HQICW", "B001J710YI", "B000G6BLWE", "B000BMY2LU", "B001HUHBBS", "B00C7A8WMO", "B0016MJ6J2", "B006JN87CU", "B00005O06W", "B000FO0AFQ", "B00GT83J1E", "B00E3QJ83C", "B00KSPST6Y", "B006TTC5GS", "B000VUQ4HM", "B00003CXGS", "6549303141", "6304493681", "B00005O3VC", "B000VE439Y", "B000AQ69QS", "B000WC38FA", "B000G6BLGK", "B000O76ZOO", "B00AEFXDGE", "B00319ECGU", "B0010YVCAM", "0783230346", "B00000K3U4", "B000EOOVMA", "B00ECXJBNS", "B003NTUOGU", "B0001S6AQE", "B00J5LXTUI", "B0003JANSW", "B00005JKHX", "B00AO686MY", "0783232063", "B00EALTX8A", "B000RJO564", "B0008JIJ2O", "B007LNBS2I", "B00F77MAO0", "B0053O8A78", "B0017XOF50", "B0000399WD", "B0000DC13R", "B00441GZ2S", "B003H9LIU2", "B00103584Y", "0062069306", "B002DH20Q0", "B00AEBB9U0", "B00K7IPGS6", "B009SQ9Q5M", "B001S86IZE", "B008L0YN18", "B000G6BLRE"], "bought_together": ["B00AMSQBUI", "B00AMSQBRQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AMSQBUI", "B00AJCUL1C", "B00AMSQBRQ", "B0001ZX0O2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 14064}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 24.36, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B000H7JCFK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XCN00YqCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Police Squad!

{"description": "NCIStakes theCSIformula, throws in a good dose ofJAG, and comes up with an entertaining series that takes advantage of the actors' likeability. The season begins with the introduction a couple new regulars--agent Timothy McGee (Sean Murray) and assistant medical examiner Jimmy Palmer (Brian Dietzen). And one cast member departs the show by the end of the season. The six-disc set includes all 23 episodes, which aired on CBS during 2004-2005. The show's sophomore year begins with \"See No Evil,\" in which a Navy officer (guest star David Keith) is forced to embezzle millions of dollars, or risk having his wife and blind daughter killed by a kidnapper (played by Tom Cruise's cousin William Mapother). Led by Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon), the crack NCIS team comes through to save the day and reveal the mastermind behind the twisted case. Gibbs doesn't display much more emotion this season than he did in the show's debut, but he's just as sarcastic (and even tempered) when being threatened. During one altercation, the mafia threatens to kill his father, brothers and uncles. Non-plussed, Gibbs calmly says that while he has no male relatives still alive, he'd be happy to fax over the numbers of his three ex-wives.With the help of his ace medical examiner Dr. Donald \"Ducky\" Mallard (David McCallum fromThe Man from U.N.C.L.E), Gibbs and his team are almost invincible when it comes to solving complicated crimes. Whether he's piecing together the bones of a body, or performing an autopsy on a crisply burnt poodle, Ducky is matter-of-fact as he talks to his dead \"clients.\" Of his nervous but eager assistant Jimmy, Ducky notes, \"He means well, but sometimes I have an overwhelming urge to slap him.\" This season, viewers get to see the romantic (and slightly gross) side of Ducky as he briefly romances a doctor half this age. Also on hand to aid (and annoy) Gibbs are happy-go-lucky Tony DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly), former Secret Service agent Caitlin Todd (Sasha Alexander), and forensics expert Abby Sciuto (Pauley Perrette), who can solve anything if you say \"please\" and bring her a Big Gulp to sip. Look for a gentle guest appearance by Charles Durning as a Medal of Honor recipient who wants to turn himself in for killing his best friend and fellow comrade during World War II. While the plot twists won't surprise most viewers, the acting, writing, and spirit of the episode leaves the viewer feeling satisfied.--Jae-Ha Kim", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000MGBSIK", "B000EWBNMI", "B000TGJ8AS", "B0019F02X0", "B002C2KAS6", "B003Q7B7B0", "B003L77G2E", "B005PYKNJY", "B00915G6MG", "B003FSTN5C", "B003L77G1K", "B005QET8FS", "B000SQFC40", "B000ION72Q", "B0000A2ZNL", "B00008972G", "B000B5XOVQ", "B000LE16XA", "B003R4ZMPE", "B00915G6NK", "B000HT3P60", "B000Q6GUS4", "B000RO6JYK", "B001AI776G", "B00CYQXDNE", "B00020H9NO", "B009LDD4V4", "B0001906X6", "B0053O89IS", "B000GG4Y5K", "B001992NWO", "B003R0MEZ4", "B001O0TWY0", "B000XCZGW2", "B004UXVDOA", "B0058YPILY", "B000H7JCE6", "B001DMVZJ4", "B000R7I44K", "B003R4ZMNQ", "B005PYHNQU", "B0013LRKVC", "B001G0MFKQ", "B003TFAJ18", "B00915G6Q2", "B00CYQXETM", "B002XKKX7K", "B002JVWR4A", "B00D1VVT3C", "B00915G4IC", "B00EIXWMII", "B000N6UF0G", "B000UX6TIE", "B000B8IA08", "B00915G6SU", "B0002NY8GW", "B003L77G8I", "B00BQ7HNQA", "B00CYQXATG", "B0015RRNMA", "B00GTZWXFU", "B000H7JCJQ", "B00ESK1PES", "B005PYL4VU", "B000B8I9ZO", "B003UD7JC6", "B0053O89KG", "B000FVQLIO", "B00GQQ75QO", "B003R0MF1W", "B009RX7IX8", "B00005JLFT", "B004UXVDJA", "B00D1VVT28", "B00DL48BM6", "B002N5N4NA", "B00B9UEOPC", "B000FIMG5Y", "B0056GLNQI", "B004132HZS", "B00BR6RVEY", "B000F9T70A", "B0053O89JM", "B00915G6R6", "B001L1S1OY", "B001A4VH2U", "B003FSTN5M", "B00GTZWXYQ", "B00CL151G4", "B004STBFPS", "B00005JLKN", "B0053O8AKU", "B00JEZWRE4", "B000R9YLKY", "B00915G6OE", "B00JF5GAZA", "B00ITAQ2T6", "B009RX7WTI", "B002BWP2IK"], "bought_together": ["B000MGBSIK", "B000EWBNMI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EWBNMI", "B000MGBSIK", "B00D1VVT28", "B000TGJ8AS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3849}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 18.91, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B000H7JCHS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51mJjQvyybL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "NCIS: Season 2"}
{"description": "As noted by Richard Stanley fans,Dust Devil, the feature following his box-office hitHardware, failed to find release, and when it did, a terrible edit drastically altered the story. Subversive Sinema has now released the director-approved final cut ofDust Devil, in a box set that also contains Dust Devil's working edit, the film's Sergio Leone-like soundtrack, and three riveting Stanley documentaries:The Secret Glory,Voice of the Moon, andThe White Darkness.Dust Devil, a horror story based on the myth of a Namibian serial killer, looks more like a Western. Filmed on location in Africa where the murders allegedly took place, Chelsea Field plays Wendy Robinson, a woman, who under duress of leaving her husband, heads out to the desert to accidentally encounter the Dust Devil (Robert John Burke), a mercy killer who slays depressed women to save them from the dark side. According to locals, the Dust Devil is a demon, enabling Stanley's abiding interest in world folk religions to weigh heavily in on the plot, especially when the town's witch doctor visits the beyond to unlock mysteries, or when the Dust Devil displays a box containing his victims' fingers. The documentaries, however, are most exciting.The White Darknessunravels political and social aspects of Haitian Voudon, including the history of American Imperialism in Haiti, as told by skilled priest and priestess, Altes Paul and Edelle.Voice of the Moonshows footage of Afghani rebels in the late '80s, sans narrator, instead beautifully accompanied by native music and poetry, adding Herzogian emotional effect.The Secret Glorypieces together the story of Otto Rahn, an SS officer who thought he'd located the Holy Grail. In all three films, the authenticity of the subjects reign, making it more difficult to buy the magic's fictionalized version inDust Devil.Dust Devil, though, with its cheesier horror moments, provides a dose of humor to a fairly serious package.--Trinie Dalton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00LMBUR6S", "B002E2QH8Q", "B002E2QHAE", "B00L22H2IS", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B00DOZNGTK", "B00K1L4NBU", "B000MV8AC2", "B00JJOY41E", "B00FUABHVQ", "B00C7A8WZQ", "B00JXZ90EA", "B00JV054A6", "B00J5LXMTG", "B004VQRCJG", "B00IQAUO2A", "B00ESZZO4A", "B00BCMT2BI", "B00HI9QDWK", "B00EOYK62A", "B00GHH9GSC", "B00HRUQ7WG", "B00JHH1VSW", "B00GOT1DIE", "B00HRISNPM", "B000IMUYJM", "B00E3H3CO2", "B00HW3EZXQ", "B00FMDL4UK", "B00FCAK1FC", "B00HHYGGBE", "B00GOT15IM", "B00H47IXBK", "B00HT2RTU6", "B00GHH9IIA", "B00026PA70", "B00HI9QDQ6", "B00CPTUNZG", "B00GBT62PQ", "B001AGNMFI", "B000P6R9N0", "B000067J0M", "B00D7AM5XU", "B00AJXO5MC", "B00CERJJ68", "B005F96UGO", "B00023P4SS", "B008VR7UDY", "B00C3KTFVU", "B00BNAE1IS", "B005FRWU5Q", "0871404028", "B00IA1VKVY", "B000096I9X", "B00GA9F2PI", "B005CM1IES", "B009IV2Z3M", "B00E5S2HGS", "B00EVU3S0E", "B00HUCF6KK", "B00EVU3RSW", "B000KRNG54", "1781162700", "B00ESZZOCM", "B00C7E3EDW", "B00AWWX8YG", "B00CC2V792", "B00A429Y56", "B00G5GNYEW", "B002AFX532", "B005E7AOCI", "B00AWHDFIU", "B00EALTWJ0", "B008HUSFYS", "B005ZHBEPI", "B00CPTUNUG", "B0000AOX0A", "B00AUPSR14", "B00EU8RCO0", "B004FUPK3I", "B00B2BYXSG", "B00ESZZOMM", "B000TSIZY6", "B00EALTVPA", "B00DOZNGC2", "B006U49SC6", "B000096I9Q", "B00GJ7CUFG", "B00B49GSQQ", "B0026VBOJ2", "B005OT810I", "B00B0LKVIY", "B00DPUB56U", "B001D5C1OO", "B001D5C1R6", "B00C7E3EFU", "B00EBDXVVW", "B002HML6YI", "B00I462XGG"], "bought_together": ["B002E2QHAE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002E2QH8Q", "B005TTEFVC", "B005J9ZFQG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 142189}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.34, "brand": "Ryko Distribution", "asin": "B000HEWGTW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510F9SGCTEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dust Devil - The Final Cut (Limited Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "ThisM*A*S*H-tastic 36-disc collection is one for the television time capsule. It contains all 11 seasons of this multi-Emmy Award-winning series, PLUS Robert Altman's 1970 iconoclastic anti-war classic, PLUS two discs of special features, including two reunion specials and a series retrospective episode of A&E;'sBiography. As with the individual season sets, there are no new episode commentaries, a major disappointment. ButM*A*S*H-ophiles will enjoy this set's other bonus features, including emotional behind-the-scenes footage of the filming of the last half-hour episode, \"As Time Goes By,\" the inevitable bloopers, interviews with cast members as well as fans about their favorite episodes, a segment about the series' \"Jocularity,\" a parade of PSAs (cut down on salt to avoid heart disease), and the text of an unproduced script penned by Alda for an episode titled, \"Hawkeye on the Double.\" All of this material (except for a commemorative booklet) is available elsewhere in different configurations, but this space-saving (albeit ungainly packaged) box set collects them all under one tent.Adapted for television by legendary comedy writer Larry Gelbart, the series has long since supplanted Altman's film in the public's consciousness. Life and death at a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital during the Korean War doesn't seem like ripe fodder for a comedy series, butM*A*S*Hmasterfully balanced laughter and tears (less so in its later, more preachy seasons). It often does play better without a laugh track (a viewing option for all episodes). During its run,M*A*S*Hsurvived several delicate operations, including the departure of Gelbart after season 4 and the loss of core ensemble members McLean Stevenson as Col. Henry Blake and Wayne Rogers as Trapper John (after season 3), Larry Linville as Frank Burns (after season 5) and Gary Burghoff (a veteran of the original film) as Radar (after season 8). The show thrived with the introduction of some new blood, Henry Morgan as \"regular Army\" Col. Potter and Mike Farrell as compassionate BJ (season 4) and David Ogden Stiers as elitist Charles Emerson Winchester III (season 6).M*A*S*Hwas honored with the prestigious Peabody Award \"for the depth of its humor and the manner in which comedy is used to lift the spirit and, as well, to offer a profound statement on the nature of war.\" This was a sitcom that did not always leave you laughing, as witness the classic season 3 episode \"Abyssinia, Henry.\" And throughout its run,M*A*S*Hbroke the sitcom mold with several episodes, including \"The Interview\" (season 4), in which Clete Roberts interviews the staff of the 4077th, \"Point of View\" (season 7), subjectively seen through the eyes of a wounded soldier and \"Life Time\" (season 8), which unfolds in real time.M*A*S*Hboasted one of television's greatest ensembles, fully embodied characters who each became icons, most notably Alan Alda, who served with distinction as Hawkeye, the series' soul and conscience. But a special salute to Loretta Switt, whose Margaret Houlihan went from \"Hot Lips\" to nobody's pushover. From the \"Pilot\" to the feature-length finale, \"Goodbye, Farewell & Amen,\" still the most-watched episode in history, this essential (but not so much if you bought the individual season sets) collection honors one of television's greatest half-hours.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000OT6V1E", "B003JV0ITA", "B00BMJ7ZKG", "B002L9N4O2", "B001IXXYCE", "B003JUVXE0", "0688149553", "B001DHXT48", "B00251EP26", "B008P9M614", "B0050MB5AC", "B000HLDFA4", "B0024HH32A", "B001E0O8DA", "B005SQRYS2", "B008HUSFTS", "B00011KM3I", "B00E8AVN9U", "B001DMVZJ4", "B004SGWYXS", "B000H5U5EE", "B004YOEECS", "B002PQ7JR4", "B00EIJTLK4", "B001DSNEME", "B00CRVL5ZE", "B003WVJ65Y", "B000V3JGIS", "B009DA74BG", "B00DXLO0D6", "B001DMVZJO", "B000MGBSEY", "B001DZOCZU", "B005F96UP0", "B000QFCDAY", "B00DYQ1G78", "B001FBV4T4", "B00HRUQB5O", "B00CD45JBG", "B0000BV1XX", "B00E5G03I4", "B00GSTHCHQ", "B00DXLO086", "B002LFPAUC", "B00FEP9MYG", "B000XJD3JS", "B000EHRVOW", "6305212112", "B009Z59ZNE", "B000XKW45Q", "B000Y5JFNE", "B001LXIDVI", "B00003CXRM", "B001FB4VXU"], "bought_together": ["B000OT6V1E", "B00BMJ7ZKG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BMJ7ZKG", "B001DMVZJ4", "B001DMVZJO", "B001DMVZJY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10518}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 129.95, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B000HT3P5Q", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41WASG65Q0L._SX300_.jpg", "title": "M*A*S*H - Martinis and Medicine Complete Collection"}
{"description": "Thai-born martial artist Tony Jaa, whose gravity-defying stunts wowed American audiences inOng-Bak: The Thai Warrior, returns in an equally eye-popping stunt fest that should thrill all but the most jaded action fans. The very simple plot has the soft-spoken, mild-mannered Jaa as a young man from a rural community dispatched to Australia to recover a pair of sacred elephants. Once there, he discovered that a female crime boss (played by transgendered actor Jing Xing) is behind the missing pachyderms, and Jaa pulls out all the stops to recover the animals for his village. As inOng-Bak, the appeal ofThe Protectoris watching Jaa unleash his muay thai skills on a host of villainous types, and he gets several astonishing showcases in this film, most notably a nearly-unbroken take in which he dispatches some 50 goons as he makes his way up a four-story structure. Those looking for the depth of story or character found in the best of Hong Kong action cinema won't find it inThe Protector, but the rewards for action fans are plentiful and thoroughly entertaining. The two-disc Collector's Edition ofThe Protectorincludes a wealth of extras, most notably the original Thai version of the film (titledTom Yum Goong), which runs approximately 30 minutes longer than the American version. Commentary by martial arts writer and fan Bey Logan is featured on the American edit, along with a deleted scene, a featurette about Jaa with Logan and rapper/producer The RZA (who scored the American version and, for some reason, is described as a major force in bringing Asian entertainment to the States), making-of featurettes on both the English and Thai versions of the film (the latter features a subtitled Thai-language commentary track with Jaa, director Prachya Pinkaew, and stunt coordinator/mentor Panna Rittikrai), and three fair short films that were produced for a promotional tie-in contest.-- Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009VBTQY", "B002XTXGA2", "B004BZ5ADW", "B00JVQ7RCS", "B002DHACS8", "B005ZMBEXU", "B001L67A4G", "B003INBNXO", "B004326EV0", "B0085A9J18", "B004I1AGTC", "B000GFLKDU", "B003FXXNH6", "B003EVAG4C", "B000K7UC2Y", "B004U7MR0K", "B000ICLU7C", "B004H2CXBQ", "B004P8R9O8", "B00ATXIJOC", "B000K2UW06", "B003LN0NXC", "B001MEJY9G", "B0035V35P8", "B0016MJ6JC", "B000N4SHNK", "B005F96UGO", "B00HSJ2EMI", "B00GXFZOYI", "B004XQO8MS", "B004SIP88Y", "B002C6VMIY", "B00J5LXST0", "B003DVB7F0", "B000A2IPQY", "B00B6OEE7O", "B006C1S1DY", "B002FU8JTW", "B0018PH3NS", "B00284G2BC", "B004U7MR1O", "B000MM0LEG", "B000V6I7N0", "B005E7SEZW", "B004GJYRKA", "B00FLCYIAA", "B001EI5C5U", "B009VL2A5M", "B001U0HB5Q", "B0054EKDEU", "B000HC2M3Y", "B00AWHDEIQ", "B0030A6ICG", "B00ET2ODYY", "B001MEJY9Q", "B00JVQ7PS4", "B000UVV2AG", "B004VW4V9E", "B00005YUNV", "B00ENTX7JU", "B00008EY6M", "B00J5LXTUI", "B0056OZI0M", "B005F96UHI", "B004SIPAP0", "B0085A9HXS", "B00C3ALL9O", "B006JD48GY", "B0019F02U8", "B00369ERCY", "B000K2V7DW", "B000EE3FUY", "B005KK2FWG", "B004TFTE9A", "B00003CXR4", "B00G3HOJZ6", "B002XTBE5Q", "B0009S2T0M", "B003YOZNFQ", "B003M9ZABU", "B000FKO5QK", "B0010X740K", "B00EI3Y1QO", "B0051SFTGQ", "B001QB9H1U", "B00FEHCQEC", "B00005OOQ1", "B000MM0LE6", "B000P6R9N0", "B008XEZXES", "B001BEK8HO", "B00003CY5A", "B000QGEB12", "0767819640", "B00HI9QGWC", "B0013D8LCM", "B0010X741O", "B0019PL2W0"], "bought_together": ["B002XTXGA2", "B0009VBTQY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0085A9J18", "B00J5LXST0", "3918810143", "B004I1AGTC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15313}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.1, "brand": "Weinstein Company", "asin": "B000I0RNWU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YIZWM7HuL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Protector (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "Dane Cook receives a rock star's welcome from a packed arena in this stand-up concert originally broadcast on HBO. But the jury may still be out on whether Cook is phenomenally funny or simply a phenomenon. He is certainly a master of the new media. Cook has savvily marketed himself on the Internet to his target college-age audience, and they have embraced him as a fellow \"bro\" and \"dude,\" who would seemingly be awesome to party with. In his timbre and physicality, he has the shaggy, likeable quality of Will Farrell, another frat boy favorite. Cook is a man of his people. At one point, he is interrupted by a drunken Boston Red Sox fan who wants to shake his hand. Cook then leaps off the stage and chases him up the aisle to give him a send-off hug, all the while being clapped on the back and offered high and low fives by the cheering audience. Cook comes complete with arrested development lingo, such as \"Here's what drove me banana sandwich,\" that will no doubt be repeated around the dorm.Don't look to Cook for satirical insights on politics, the war, or even pop culture. His world view is much narrower.  InVicious Circlehe expounds on the pleasures and traps of lying, male crying, being sneezed on, his father's robe, bad relationships, and sundry sexual matters that cannot be printed here. Cook takes awhile to get where he's going, but his digressions are often funnier than the pay offs. He puts the brakes on one story during which he mimes driving a car to remark that if he were actually driving this way, he would be all over the road. During other bits, he parses the different spray modes on Windex, and takes the phrase \"being cheated on\" literally. And it takes some kind of associative genius to compare a certain female body part to a high school stage theatre curtain. The less than well receivedEmployee of the Monthaside, Cook is currently king of the comedy hill.Vicious Circleoffers a time capsule look at these heady good times for the great Dane. As for where he goes from here, the good news is that Steve Martin once filled arenas like this. The bad news: So did Andrew Dice Clay.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002MU4NNQ", "B000VQW7PE", "B00009V7U2", "B0009W5ITW", "B000ION25I", "B000RGULMO", "B00466K58Q", "B002HK9IMC", "B000NO23VW", "B000CSUNKW", "B000Y7U99G", "B001VFM63W", "B001FRNB94", "B000LC3ICE", "B001HB1K0A", "B000P6R6Y2", "B001L9EXTS", "B000Y7U93C", "B004B93RC4", "B002FP1430", "B001PKHS90", "B00EKR61BQ", "B003G715ZS", "B002TQKL0W", "B0000399WN", "B00026L9BQ", "B006VC3LGQ", "B001BEK88I", "B000QFAFNQ", "B0002RIKCQ", "B001HB1JY2", "B005SHBO1Y", "B009RJRHLA", "B008H4MFSG", "B00000JWVS", "B000Y7U94G", "B000095J1K", "B001TWT0DG", "B00A3A3V0I", "B003X3BY8I", "B003498S3U", "B000LPR9ZI", "B000KG4BTU", "B0009VRHLU", "B001QU9RT8", "B0074B2MXG", "B006YWIFH8", "B001RTKKOO", "B001D2WUDO", "B001LM64W4", "B005PTYOX0", "B000077VQ6", "B002BDV5OE", "B00028G6MQ", "B00AEFXUFS", "B000C20VIW", "B0019F030C", "B0031U8OIQ", "B002L9N4YW", "B000JBXP1Q", "B002HGRI9G", "B009K23LXW", "B00000AFGO", "B000GW8RYS", "B003BJO8I2", "B000EULSSE", "B00BUG6LRO", "B002NN7F2I", "B000GRUN40", "B001CQONM2", "B000CR8QRU", "B0000C237Y", "B0074JOD4E", "B00003CWOU", "B004HY3BUG", "B004B93RCO", "B000LV6VYM", "B000A0GOUU", "B000LC52DC", "B004F4HWQM", "B00023P4FG", "B00BEZEGTG", "B000CPH9PM", "B008PWPMRG", "B0002I84FI", "B001B187HA", "B00022PZ2Y", "B0002XEEAM", "B001UDUR5Y", "B007M8SAHS", "B001J9KJ4I", "B00114UUBS", "B0001CNRRU", "B003HTPHUE", "B006CTKWDS", "B002C7ELWC", "B00007G1WV"], "bought_together": ["B002MU4NNQ", "B000VQW7PE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00009V7U2", "B00466K58Q", "B000VQW7PE", "B002MU4NNQ"]}, "price": 22.48, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 28038}, "asin": "B000IU37TS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/611angvx2vL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dane Cook - Vicious Circle"}

{"description": "A disturbing film about a recovering drug addict trying to regain control of her life,Sherrybabysuccinctly depicts what can happen when want and desire aren't offset by control. In this bleak indie film, Sherry Swanson (Maggie Gyllenhaal,Stranger Than Fiction,Secretary) has just been released from a three-year stint in prison. Dressed in her inappropriate uniform of a halter top and oh-so-high platform heels, she goes to brother's house to see her 5-year-old daughter, Lexie (Ryan Simpkins). Sherry is determined to be a mother to her child, but without a home, job, or any other form of stability, she grows frustrated and jealous of her brother and sister-in-law's roles in Lexie's life. Tall and willowy, Gyllenhaal brings a sad desperation and simmering sexuality to the role. Sherry's middle-class childhood was a blur of sex and drugs, and she seems incapable of breaking out of that destructive trap. While the script by first-time feature film director Laurie Collyer isn't wholly original, the picture moves at a good pace, giving insight as to why Sherry's resigned to using sex to get what she wants. While the family secret doesn't come as a complete surprise, it is somewhat perplexing that no one addresses it. Ultimately, it's Gyllenhaal who makes you care about a character that most people would've given up on.--Jae-Ha Kim", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000I0QL7I", "B0007CEXYK", "B000E6ESU8", "B00008MTXI", "B0006IIKRG", "B000LAZDPG", "6305692572", "B00004UEDQ", "B00A2H9QN8", "B000ERVK4Y", "B003YKYX9M", "B00005JM23", "B0045HCJ08", "B003Y5H59C", "B00005Q4CS", "B000Z3N1HQ", "6305162026", "B0017X1WGK", "6305594333", "B001E95ZNS", "B007VI5AQ8", "B00JAGF9HE", "B0052ADP6Y", "B0000549B1", "B000BBOUUE", "B003AC98V2", "B00009Y3QI", "B00EUENWIY", "B00049QQHI", "B002UNMWTC", "B004V4RW8O", "B000GB5M3S", "B000J10F8C", "B00005JH9M", "0578045427", "0792838068", "B0039Y774Q", "B0000ZMGWK", "B000XSKDBA", "B0015VQAZM", "B007TSV4GK", "B003JO6OPO", "B004SUDQC2", "B001CRC4DG", "B0050ODZ6M", "B00005JMIJ", "B00ET2ODTE", "B000ICL3NI", "B00023P4I8", "B00008972P", "B00005JMU1", "B0002KPIQY", "B0040J1RX6", "B00GRZPRB4", "B00AFEXRME", "B000PKG8TM", "B000N3SU92", "B00HOGBXS6", "B004QL7JYO", "B0006IIPLM", "B00641Y2ZS", "B0000DBJ8B", "B00INUK5WM", "B00K0MM4AM", "B006GL8NQ0", "B0016I0AKU", "B00005JKN2", "B001CC7PRQ", "B000LC3I9W", "B00000IBL1", "B001C5LLVE", "B0009GX1XI", "B001FRNB9E", "B001PPLJIQ", "B006M3M5FM", "B001URA5Y8", "B0029Z8K74", "B00EMAGKNU", "B00013RC2K", "B004YCKKFK", "B004L3AR0K", "B00AEFXJ86", "B000067IZ3", "B002Q3MZXE", "B00JPSYPCM", "B001AIQ14A", "B00005U14H", "B003Z8ZC2A", "B00IARA89S", "B0010DM3R4", "B0015XHQXU", "B000FTCF3G", "B00005QJIG", "B000TLTCQI", "B004RD3YFE", "B00114XTHA", "076782170X", "B000EZ9084", "B0057ZAA6W"], "bought_together": ["B0007CEXYK", "B000I0QL7I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000I0QL7I", "6305692572", "B00008MTXI", "B0007CEXYK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 28252}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.25, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B000JBXXYK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516NtGsG%2BnL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sherrybaby"}
{"description": "Pile together a blue-ribbon cast, a screenplay high in quirkiness, and the Sundance stamp of approval, and youve got yourself a crossover indie hit. That formula worked for Little Miss Sunshine, a frequently hilarious study of family dysfunction. Meet the Hoovers, an Albuquerque clan riddled with depression, hostility, and the tattered remnants of the American Dream; despite their flakiness, they manage to pile into a VW van for a weekend trek to L.A. in order to get moppet daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) into the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. Much of the pleasure of this journey comes from watching some skillful comic actors doing their thing: Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette as the parents (hes hoping to become a self-help authority), Alan Arkin as a grandfather all too willing to give uproariously inappropriate advice to a sullen teenage grandson (Paul Dano), and a subdued Steve Carell as a jilted gay professor on the verge of suicide. The film is a crowd-pleaser, and if anything is a little too eager to bend itself in the direction of quirk-loving Sundance audiences; it can feel forced. But the breezy momentum and the ingenious actors help push the material over any bumps in the road. -- Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000YABYLA", "B00005JMJG", "B001UV4XGU", "B00A81MV3U", "B00DL46ZN8", "B00005JNC2", "B0007TKOAA", "B001UV4XUG", "B00005ALS0", "B00118T632", "B00AEFXESQ", "B007L6VR12", "B008220BA2", "B003L20ICE", "B0000640VJ", "B008OHV49W", "B001P9KR8U", "B000A7DVR2", "B00000F5MN", "B007L6VRBM", "B00AFEY354", "B0001GOH6Q", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00337KM2S", "B000H0MKOC", "B004UXUX4Q", "B0034G4OZE", "B00011CZRE", "B00275EGWY", "0205751989", "B000FVQLQQ", "B0010X8NF0", "B004SIP95G", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B004QL7KKC", "B00079Z9VO", "B00003CXZ4", "B0021L8UOY", "B001MM3AZM", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00606P0BM", "B00005Q4CS", "B00ADRYCWC", "B001TOD92C", "B004SEUIW4", "B000P0J0EW", "B0015OKWKI", "B000CS464G", "B0007PLLBU", "B00009W5CA", "B00005JLSB", "B004A8ZWV0", "B007RKFXUS", "B0010AN7Z4", "B00012QLB4", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B003UESJH4", "B00005JNBQ", "B007VYE4PK", "B000WZEZGI", "B00AEBB9F0", "6304907729", "B003Y5H574", "B000SFOW8I", "B00005JMJ4", "B001BL96K2", "B00006FMUW", "B002VPTJOA", "B00003CXO1", "B000J103OI", "B0038N9WKU", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00008975Z", "B003ASLJQI", "B0049985XW", "B003ASLJO0", "B001J9KJ4I", "B001FZQOW2", "B00000G02H", "1557047707", "B000BYRCQU", "B00121QGPY", "B00005JL57", "B000021Y77", "B000A3XY5A", "B000MZHW40", "B0000AC8LR", "B00AEFY0KW", "B0045HCJ9E", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B00AEBB9FA", "B00005A06N", "B000ELJAEM", "B00AEFYAMA", "B00E8RKHWW", "B00005JLRE", "B005LAIHE0", "B000M341QE", "B0039UT3LK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00118T632", "B00DL46ZN8", "B0007UC8Y4", "B001AGXEAG"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 401537}, "asin": "B000JU9OJ4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51T7A7BDBWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Little Miss Sunshine [Region 2]"}

{"description": "Girls, this is just what the doctor ordered: A cozy, romantic boxed set of some of Danielle Steel's best escapist films--like the best of Lifetime Movie Network condensed into two fabulous discs. The set contains four films, including the little-seen but deeply involvingThe Promise, starring a lovely young Kathleen Quinlan and Stephen Collins, pre-7th Heaven--even pre-Sisters. The two play college sweethearts whom fate brings together in a jarring, violent way--forcing them to make a chain of decisions that will affect their lives forever. Quinlan and Collins have believable chemistry and their longing is palpable. Bonus: the production values are extremely high, including a score by David Shire, and direction by Gil Cates (perhaps most famous as the director of the Academy Awards broadcasts).    The other films include:Palomino, a tale of worldly city gal finding her inner ranch hand--and true love in the arms of a wrangler--in rugged California horse country. Lindsay Frost and Peter Bergman have palpable sexual tension, and the always-welcome Eva Marie Saint makes a memorable cameo.Secrets, starring Josie Bissett (an actress talented enough to lead her own TV series) as a soap star who finds the juice and intrigue off camera every bit as knotty as her show's plotlines.Star, with Jennie Garth and Craig Bierko as lovers for whom time, distance, and enormous difference of circumstance matter not when they unexpectedly reunite years later.So heat up the tea and popcorn; this disc is a perfect girls' weekend, whether you have several girlfriends joining you or just your own sweet comfy self.--A.T.

{"description": "LikeSex & the City,Living Single, andFriends,Girlfriendsfocuses on a group of best pals whose lives are forever intertwined, for better or for worse. On the first season ofGirlfriends--which aired during 2000-2001--we are introduced to a comely group of women. There's Joan (Tracee Ellis Ross, daughter of Diana Ross), a sensible attorney who's unlucky in love; her sassy assistant Maya (Golden Brooks); Joan's happy-go-lucky roommate Lynn (Persia White); and their man-eating friend Toni (Jill Marie Jones). That the women are African American is incidental, because their stories are universal. The adore each other, but each is seeking love and validation, not that the two necessarily go hand in hand. While their escapades lead to many laughs, the writers include enough poignant moments that the show has some heart. Even when Toni goes on a date with Joan's ex--a major violation amongst any group of girlfriends--the women manage to work their issues out in a way that is realistic enough to be recognizable, but comedic enough that we laugh at their antics. The four-disc set includes all 22 episodes from its debut season, including \"Never a Bridesmaid,\" in which Joan and Maya collaborate to coordinate a wedding together. Executive produced by Kelsey Grammer (Frasier,Cheers), the sitcom is smart and well cast. There is genuine chemistry between the four leads, and Reggie Hayes has wonderful comic timing as their much-put upon best male friend William. Ross, who shares her mother's fine-boned beauty, proves to be deceptively good with physical comedy. That she is gorgeous is lost on Joan, who in real life would be working her looks to her utmost advantage. More than just girlfriends, Joan, Maya, Lynn, and Toni are great friends.--Jae-Ha Kim", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000SQFC1I", "B000Y7U9AU", "B0017VG67W", "B001CQONMW", "B001MVWM6Q", "B001JAHQ52", "B002TQKL52", "B000BYA4I8", "B002CLKV68", "B00962R0F6", "B005FHXHGM", "B000094J5Z", "B0038Q9Q94", "B002TQKL48", "B005MQ589U", "B003FLQPVE", "B00GOZ2LPM", "B007TWGU10", "B005LAIH86", "B0002O7Y8U", "6305505780", "B00DW5IL2E", "B002XUBDXS", "B00H47IX5G", "B000PHX5M8", "B000BYA4JW", "B00BEL4QFO", "B002CA68NO", "B0006N2EZU", "B0010YVCAW", "B0000TWMWK", "B000A7DW7Q", "B000068V9X", "B0055OTDCM", "B002FYE5FU", "B004ULNJIA", "B002LCQBM6", "B00I099K4U", "B0009JQN6M", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B001HUHBD6", "B0006N2F04", "B00G7QPTR0", "B00F8BI4QS", "B001NFNFM6", "B00066FAQW", "B002TQKL4S", "B008Y1YJN6", "B001JV5BC6", "B000SO7PCO", "B001132GNY", "B00005RDAH", "B00HW3EI3I", "B0009W5J4Q", "B00005JLON", "B000XCZGY0", "B000BQ7J8Y", "B00014K5UK", "B0053YT3II", "B000YAF4Q6", "B00004RFCM", "B000VZADPG", "B00AEBB9AA", "B00D2UMHB0", "B0009A40NO", "B0007ZSHR6", "B006U49SJE", "B00007ELEO", "B000Y11B8K", "B00005JKMQ", "B003Y5H58S", "B00079FUI6", "B006OKOVYG", "B002OOK6WM", "B00E1HIX66", "B0058EE6OO", "B000FA57IU", "B002LCOGBE", "0780627822", "B000TZ7FTK", "B0007KIFNC", "B0000CGNEC", "B00003CY51", "B001CIOCOY", "B0002W4SX6", "B001AQR3LC", "B00ANDDBBY", "B000M341S2", "B0009A40O8", "B008RR4HQQ", "B005KR6NNG", "B003Y5H56K", "B00004Y2R1", "B002WIDRLM", "B0015RRNMA", "B0018RNF60", "B000FS9ULC", "B0011UBDS6", "B0002RQ3MK"], "bought_together": ["B000SQFC1I", "B000Y7U9AU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002TQKL4S", "B000SQFC1I", "B000Y7U9AU", "B0017VG67W"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 80130}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 16.19, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B000KLQUM6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ESkFNxIWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Girlfriends - The Complete First Season"}
{"description": "Growing up can be a confusing journey fraught with difficult choices.  Boog (Martin Lawrence) is a domesticated Grizzly Bear who leads a perfectly happy life inside of Park Ranger Beth's (Debra Messing) garage, but a chance meeting with an overly energetic mule deer named Elliot (Ashton Kutcher) quickly changes everything and lands Boog high in the forest a few days before the opening of hunting season.  Devoid of even the most basic survival skills, Boog and Elliot stumble through the woods and find themselves at the mercy of every forest animal from skunks to chipmunks as well as an evil hunter named Shaw (Gary Sinise).  After unintentionally inciting and endangering an entire forest full of clever animals, Boog and Elliot come to the realization that only by banding together do the forest animals stand a chance of outsmarting the hunters and ensuring their own survival.This first animated film from Sony Pictures Animation takes its inspiration from cartoonist Steve Moore(In the Bleachers)and features animals with human-like intelligence, a vibrant color palate, and skilled animation that makes everything from the wind blowing Boo's fur to the animals' wild trip down the falls simply breathtaking.  While it doesn't quite live up toOver the Hedge,Open Seasonis an entertaining production that explores the difficult process of maturation, the universal need for acceptance, and the true value of friendship.  Special features include a 15-minute featurette about the animation process at Sony Pictures Animation and Image Works, a 7-minute look at the recording sessions featuring the voices behind the characters, two deleted scenes, three short animated cartoon strips, a short \"Boog and Elliot's Midnight Bun Run\" that's an extension of the trailer scene in the movie, art gallery, beat boards, humorous commentary from the animals' point of views, and a full length commentary by Producer Michelle Murdocca, Directors Roger Allers and Jill Culton, and others.  Activities include a \"Voice-A-Rama\" where viewers can hear specific lines spoken by alternate voices and a trivia \"Wheel of Fortune--Forest Edition\" as well as a DVD-ROM link to more online fun.

{"description": "If the first five years were about raising a family,Full House's sixth was about learning to let go. In season opener \"Come Fly with Me,\" 15-year-old D.J. (Candace Cameron) introduces her first boyfriend, Steve (new cast member Scott Weinger), to the rest of the gang (the two got together during a summer program in Spain). Danny (Bob Saget) doesn't think she's ready for a relationship, but maybe he's just jealous since his long-distance love, Vicky (Gail Edwards), remains in Colorado. Meanwhile, Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen) bids goodbye to her best friend, Teddy (Tahj Mowry), when his family moves from California to Texas. While there are no marriages or births this time around, other changes are afoot. While Jesse (John Stamos), frontman for the Rippers, still struggles for recognition in the States, he becomes a star in Japan (\"Road to Tokyo\"). Closer to home, he joins forces with Joey (Dave Coulier). This time, instead of advertising, they collaborate on a radio show (\"Radio Days\"). As for Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin), she helps a classmate out of a jam (\"Silence Is Not Golden\"). Meanwhile, toddling twins Nicky and Alex (Blake and Dylan Tuomy-Wilhoit) continue to provide the cuteness factor Michelle monopolized in the early days.Also in year six,Full Housefinally casts off those overused catch phrases, like \"You got it, dude!\" and \"How rude!\" (Though Jesse still exclaims \"Have mercy!\" on occasion.) Guest stars include Mark Linn-Baker (Perfect Strangers) as Becky's cousin (\"Trouble in Twin Town\") and MTV VJ Martha Quinn as Jesse and Joey's boss (\"Designing Mothers\" and \"The Dating Game\"). The season ends with a Tannerino trip to Disney World in fan favorite \"The House Meets the Mouse.\"--Kathleen C.
