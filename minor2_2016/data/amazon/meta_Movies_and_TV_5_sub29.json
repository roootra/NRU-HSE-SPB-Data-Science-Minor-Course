{"description": "After several excursions into supernatural horror, Dario Argento returned to the homicidal frenzy that made his reputation with this mystery that plays more like a grown-up slasher movie than a detective thriller. Anthony Franciosa stars as Peter Neal, a bestselling horror novelist whose promotional tour in Italy takes a terrible turn when a mysterious killer re-creates the brutal murders from his book with real-life victims.  The first to die are so-called \"deviants,\" Neal's own friends, and finally there comes a promise that the author himself is next on the list.Columboit ain't, but Argento has always been more concerned with style than story and his execution of the crimes is pure cinematic bravura.  From the simple beauty of a straight razor shattering a light bulb (the camera catches the red-hot filament slowly blacking out) to an ambitious crane shot that creeps up and over the sides of a house under siege in a voyeuristic survey that would make Hitchcock proud, Argento turns the art of murder into a stylish spectacle. He even lets his kinkier side show with flashbacks of an adolescent boy and a teasing dominatrix in red stiletto heels that become a key motif of the film. The objects of Argento's homicidal tendencies are traditionally lovely, scantily clad Italian beauties, and with self-deprecating humor he even inserts a scene in which Neal is taken to task for the misogynist violence of his stories--an accusation Argento himself has weathered for years.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305807426", "6305095566", "6304819927", "630580740X", "B00000F6FN", "0764005685", "6304370458", "6300214087", "6303442315", "6300214192", "6302975832", "0764005707", "B00023NRSM", "6304361025", "6301726383", "6305972060", "B001B1Q3LM", "6305498784", "B002E01MHY", "6301708695", "B002UR4GDI", "630191547X", "6303257879", "B000YKI4U4", "B000TZJCN2"], "bought_together": ["6305807426"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 402377}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 29.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0764005693", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51V45XGPZQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tenebre [VHS]"}

Originally made as a five-hour miniseries, this version devotes more time to getting to know the crew before they and their stoic captain (J&uuml;rgen Prochnow) get aboard their U-boat and find themselves stranded at the bottom of the sea.Das Bootputs you inside that submerged vessel and explores the physical and emotional tensions of the situation with a vivid, terrifying realism that few movies can match. As Petersen tightens the screws and the submerged ship blows bolts, the pressure builds to such unbearable levels that you may be tempted to escape for a nice walk on solid land in the great outdoors--only you wouldn't dream of looking away from the screen.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CXHJ", "B0009RCPUC", "B009XTF8NI", "B0001NBMH6", "B00008K76U", "B00AEFYENK", "0304352314", "B00IJZW3QW", "B0001FGC1U", "B000021Y77", "0792841670", "6304765258", "B00005YUO1", "B00004XPPC", "B000274THQ", "B000EHSVS2", "B000EHSVSC", "B00005N5S3", "B00005JPKE", "B000E5N6KW", "B000NO1XJA", "B000OVLBGC", "0792839730", "B004VGHF7K", "B0007TKNGA", "B0000AMRUP", "B000O78L0U", "B0001NBMGC", "B00096S4B2", "B000H1RFQ4", "B00ID8H8EW", "B0001HLVS2", "B00005PJ8T", "B005HP2IYE", "B000MGTQ7K", "B00001ZWUS", "B00008AOTR", "B0009XRZI8", "B00079ZACC", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B00005AVZU", "B003ELKNH2", "B005HQBO9I", "B00005PJ8S", "B00005QCVP", "B005DTZXL4", "B00005JN9P", "B00AEFXVCU", "B0001WTWWE", "0790742047", "B00008PC0Y", "B00KHWSB5M", "B004ZJZQFG", "B0015D20FE", "B001TUZG4K", "B002KECJZ8", "079284646X", "B000MGTQ7U", "B00006ADD5", "B0000A02TY", "B0009A40EI", "B004R6EF9U", "B00008AOTO", "B000E5N63Y", "B00AEFYBA6", "B000M4RG42", "B000H5V8H2", "B00AEBBA36", "B00IVLR9JA", "B00009MEC4", "B00BTYNXL4", "B002QP145C", "B00BTYJYR6", "0792841409", "B004GJYRI2", "0792838408", "B000YKT4BW", "B002ID09BM", "B0051HCVEU", "B0037A4ILC", "B000TGCR38", "B00008AOTN", "B00005JKF6", "B000O599Z8", "B00008PC13", "B00B0U2SFE", "B003AWRMCO", "B000H1RFSM", "B0006B2A42", "B0012QE4PI", "B0006GANN2", "B006TTC5HC", "B0002XVS7Y", "B000I6BJ56", "B004QSQMPE", "B00005U8EN", "B008XJM7T2", "B000FZETR0"], "bought_together": ["B0001NBMH6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00IJZW3QW", "B00003CXHJ", "B009XTF8NI", "B0009RCPUC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 11970}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 16.47, "brand": "Columbia/Tristar Studios", "asin": "0767802470", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PPEJHCV3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Das Boot - The Director's Cut"}

One by one, each is drawn into the very\"personal project\" Graham is working on, leaving the relationships between them forever transformed.

{"description": "Frenchman Jean Valjean (Liam Neeson), imprisoned for stealing bread, is paroled after nearly two decades of hard labor. A gift of silver candlesticks from a kindly priest helps him begin anew. Forging a decent and profitable existence, he finds success as a businessman and as the mayor of a small town. He even takes in a pregnant young woman (Uma Thurman) and raises her daughter as his own. When a former prison guard (Geoffrey Rush) recognizes Valjean, his past catches up to him. Director Bille August culls mesmerizing performances from his cast, but loses us with an ending that panders to teen audiences. The focus shifts dramatically, and uncomfortably, from the haunted Neeson and his hawk-like pursuer, to his daughter (Claire Danes) and her romance with a handsome revolutionary. After this narrative shift, the script leaves behind the Victor Hugo classic's themes of revenge and redemption to focus improbably on teen angst--hardly what Hugo had on his mind.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002235R6", "B000MGBLI2", "B00ATK02WM", "B005S9EK5Y", "B00006ADFM", "B008DH9GMK", "B00A32H1DO", "079283366X", "B0007TKNII", "B004I2K4DY", "B00B0U2SFE", "0792839137", "B000UYN9OA", "B005S9EKCW", "B009M1HJ3O", "B005GRF2WS", "B004A8ZX28", "B000VNMMQG", "B0000524E4", "B000RPCK2E", "B000000OQI", "B005LAIIRQ", "B003498SCQ", "B000PKG6P8", "6304806418", "B00AEFXKUI", "B00BG08FKK", "B000BFJM26", "B00008G8LG", "B000AARKOO", "B00021R7BM", "B00AEFY5B6", "0800141601", "0800141660", "0767812131", "B00005JM5B", "0679600124", "B00BC0JGUW", "B0018YCF50", "067986668X", "0822007355", "B0000694XX", "B001GH3CLA", "B002ZG994U", "B002M2Z3BA", "B009AMANBA", "160710816X", "045141943X", "B003UESJH4", "B0007GP836", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00006ZXSK", "076781326X", "B004SIP9U6", "B00132D7VS", "B002NZK5UK", "B002GHHHPQ", "B0000YTP02", "B000FFJ83A", "B00013RC84", "B000ARTN3I", "B00AMEZDPG", "6305133409", "B00AEFYIH2", "B002VWNID6", "B0001I55TC", "B000B7MX7A", "B000Z8GZYW", "B00001ZWUS", "B0067EKYAY", "B00FZRP8FU", "0449300021", "B0002E5L62", "B004SIP6BI", "B003LMPKSQ", "B000NOIVT0", "B00AEFYSWM", "B004SEUJBE", "B00066FB52", "B007SPPANM", "6304696515", "B0010YSD7W", "B00004XPPG", "B0001GOH6Q", "6305428352", "0881885770", "B00005JH9M", "B0074JOUHE", "B000957O82", "B00019072G", "B0000DJZ8R", "B00AEBB8YW", "0783240171", "B002ZG977Y", "B005SFR7YE", "B006FE83UE", "B004U7MQZ6", "B003BJODK0", "B000C20VU0", "B005LAII1W"], "bought_together": ["B005S9EK5Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005S9EK5Y", "B004I2K4DY", "B0002235R6", "B000MGBLI2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15456}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.85, "brand": "Columbia/Tristar Studios", "asin": "076781505X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MeImdd92L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Les Miserables"}
{"description": "From the sun-dappled heartland, a young man (Robert Redford, in soft lighting) emerges as maybe the best baseball player anybody's ever seen. On his way to the majors, he is cut down by an enigmatic black widow (Barbara Hershey) and vanishes for many years. When he reemerges, a silent mystery, he lands a spot with the New York team and begins tearing up the league--he's still the natural. Fans of the Bernard Malamud novel will be dismayed at the pure mythical hokum of this film, but baseball fanatics have been known to watch and rewatch this one; after all, it's constructed as a kind of shrine to the national pastime. Barry Levinson (Rain Man) directs the movie with an unabashed devotion to the game, although the film could use more of the realities of chewing tobacco and pine tar. Redford is fine, and Kim Basinger and Oscar-nominated Glenn Close are effective as the women in his life. The crowning touch is the soaring, extraordinary music by Randy Newman, the singer-songwriter turned orchestral composer.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005M20M", "0783235968", "B000068NNT", "630273973X", "6302534372", "6302415853", "6305132666", "0800121600", "6304291698", "B00004RGUU", "6305126062", "630596260X", "B0000399WO", "6301734734", "6303597874", "6302936381", "B00000I1DI", "6303014100", "076780922X", "B0000048ZL", "6300181472", "0792841786", "0790743159", "0792839846", "5559477621", "6302226899", "6302450179", "6302023742", "B0000068ZQ", "630018224X", "6300183513", "630299005X", "B00004RFFA", "B0000068EE", "630150528X", "6300246965", "B00000JGEI", "B000M5BRX2", "6300215695", "6302360978", "6302909023", "6300181154", "6300184927", "0800179552"], "bought_together": ["B00005M20M", "0783235968"], "also_viewed": ["0783235968", "B000003KMM", "B0000399WO", "6300216810"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 348212}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.79, "brand": "", "asin": "0767809262", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51816SHE4HL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Natural [VHS]"}

{"description": "William Holden is the hunky drifter who rides the rails into a small Midwest town with dreams of landing a \"respectable\" job with his rich college buddy (Cliff Robertson). Kim Novak is the small-town beauty queen engaged to Robertson who falls for the cocky dreamer, as do repressed schoolmarm spinster Rosalind Russell and Novak's tomboyish kid sister Susan Strasberg. Their unleashed passions reach a crescendo at the Labor Day picnic.Joshua Logan directed William Inge's play on Broadway and carried it to Hollywood, earning Oscar nominations for Best Picture and Best Director in his screen-directing debut. Holden is years too old for the role but oozes sex appeal and makes a swoony stud when he takes his shirt off (or when, better yet, it's ripped from his back by a boozing Russell), and Novak is a lovely lost girl yearning for something she can't quite grasp. Arthur O'Connell earned an Oscar nomination as Russell's tippling boyfriend. The film was a huge popular and critical hit, but Logan's stiff and strident direction hasn't dated well. He makes his points in big capital letters--subtlety was never his strong point--and loses the natural beauty of the Kansas locations when he takes the climactic picnic scenes into an obviously artificial soundstage.Picnicremains a loved American classic, largely for Holden's tough-guy vulnerability and James Wong Howe's brilliant widescreen color photography.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003Q433", "B001LPWGGY", "B00008MTW2", "B00003L9CI", "B000068QJP", "B00AEFXLKC", "B0007US7FI", "B000JU8HBA", "B0002B15Y2", "B003MJQ9JM", "B004LB5FB8", "B000W089XI", "B000EBD9T4", "B0000DJZ8Q", "B00005JKF6", "B003WH765U", "B000CNESN0", "B00195I3OK", "B000VECAEY", "B00AEBB89C", "B0007US7EY", "B00BMEF6ZC", "B0087ZG7OI", "B00AATV07S", "B000F7CMQ8", "B00AEFY9GW", "0767821556", "B00AEBB8OC", "B0045HCJ8U", "B00004XPPC", "B00004XPPK", "B000EBD9TO", "B00003CXBZ", "B0006GANZK", "B0087ZG7R0", "B00004TWZH", "B001KXZGO6", "B00004TX2E", "B00FZRP8FU", "B00AMEZDK6", "B0002ERWZ0", "B00AATFJI4", "B00005BCK0", "B00L0DKO98", "0767821807", "B000062XEX", "B000JLTR9A", "B00004XMV9", "B00AEBB97S", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B00AEFXD1O", "B003J216LS", "B00BTYSIXC", "B00871C09S", "B00005AUKE", "B0008ENIAC", "B0007TKNHE", "B000JF5T5W", "082220892X", "B000WTVZHQ", "B00000K3D5", "B003O2H7MA", "B00AEBBA7W", "B00EL6ABL2", "B00EKGX2P0", "B001D8W7EK", "B00008MTW0", "B00066FAOE", "B00074DY16", "B0007MANZI", "B0045HCJ9E", "B002TOL4AK", "B0024FADC4", "B004H83IFU", "B001D8W7EU", "B00FNRA10E", "B000JLTRG8", "B00003CXBU", "B00005AUK7", "B0012OX7DA", "B000E1MXSW", "B001GUYAZY", "B00096S4DA", "B007TYI7YQ", "B000056H2H", "B003C6Y6VI", "B00K6D1QV8", "B00011D1OU", "B00DSAUKKY", "B00AJCUL0I", "B000KGGJ1I", "B000KE045M", "B000FUH38C", "B0006B2A7E", "B00005AUKC", "B0008ENIDO", "B000XT1P48", "B000MGBLHI", "B004NW8SYG"], "bought_together": ["B00003Q433", "B001LPWGGY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003O2H7MA", "B001LPWGGY", "B00008MTW2", "B00003Q433"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18405}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "0767827791", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CE99PHE5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Picnic: Restored"}
{"description": "This sumptuous and moving 1994 film written and directed by Bernard Rose (Candyman) investigates the artistic and romantic passions of one of the greatest composers of all time. Featuring a superb performance by Gary Oldman (Sid and Nancy) as Ludwig van Beethoven,Immortal Belovedis full of uncommonly vivid, rich imagery as it charts the tumultuous life of the deaf child prodigy and his rise to the height of musical achievement. Along the way, he attempts to play mentor to his nephew, attend to his many passionate romances--the most stable one was with a countess (Isabella Rossellini)--and fight bouts of depression and madness that ruled his life and his art. The film is framed around a \"Rosebud\"-type letter found after the composer's death that makes up the crux of the story. Jeroen Krabb&eacute; (The Fugitive), playing Beethoven's lifelong friend, attempts to discover who Beethoven's muse really was, becoming as driven as his friend in discovering the unlikely identity of the composer's \"immortal beloved.\" Through this we gain an insight into the nature of obsession, romance, and the heights and sacrifices of artistic achievement. The film exhibits some extraordinary sound design, and the finale features a magical encapsulation of Beethoven's life and loves set to his \"Ode to Joy.\" As an exciting and passionate journey,Immortal Belovedis its own masterpiece.--Robert Lane", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 614366}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.9, "brand": "", "asin": "0767824407", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515AXXJZF6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Immortal Beloved [VHS]"}
{"description": "BeforeThe Wild Bunch, there wasThe Professionals,  Richard Brooks's marvelous ode to friendship, loyalty, and disillusionment. It may not have the stylistic bravado or fatalistic doom of the legendary Sam Peckinpah film, but Brooks's storytelling is simple and steady and just as insightful. The difference is Brooks is a lot more optimistic. Lee Marvin and Burt Lancaster are buddies who have drifted into oblivion after fighting together in the Mexican Revolution. Marvin, the principled loyalist and munitions expert, lost his wife and his heart. Lancaster, the dynamite expert and unprincipled adventurer, keeps losing his pants. They team up with wrangler Robert Ryan and archer Woody Strode to rescue the beguiling Claudia Cardinale, who has been kidnapped by their old revolutionary buddie Jack Palance. So it's back into bloody Mexico they go on a \"mission of mercy\" for railroad tycoon Ralph Bellamy, who's paying handsomely for the return of his wife.But nothing is what it seems in this exciting, existential adventure, which was beautifully shot by Conrad Hall. Sarcastic quips, philosophical musings, and heart-rending reversals underlie Brooks's humanistic sentiments. These are tired, world-weary men who somehow find the strength and the will to pull together for the sake of love and commitment. Through it all, Brooks seems to be lamenting a decline in professionalism much deeper than his story. He's decrying Hollywood and the society at large, anticipating Peckinpah's later strategy.--Bill Desowitz", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0045HCJTO", "B00AEFYSEA", "B00005LOL2", "B00AEFYPHA", "B000NQRR34", "B00AEBB8W4", "B0042RJWTM", "B000QRI1GW", "B004XWGZK0", "B0008ENHUS", "B000056H2H", "B00097DY2A", "B000056H2K", "B000059TFW", "B00008CMR1", "B00005LOL3", "B00083FZFY", "B000EHSVW8", "B00AEFXFW6", "B0041ONFI0", "B00BTYPW8G", "B00K6D1QEK", "B00AEBB932", "B00AEFY9YY", "B00AEFYL6K", "0783228031", "B0007TKNM4", "B00004TJJU", "B007Y1NR1W", "B000FTCLQW", "B000BDH6DU", "B0007PALJS", "B000EHSVWS", "B0007PALKC", "B00BTYU3UI", "B003AWRMCE", "B000BT96DW", "B006VRRGOO", "B0016LFG2Y", "B00AMDA2OY", "B001LMAK88", "B0014BQR1A", "B00158K0RO", "B001PO55AA", "B000ANVPP6", "B003ASLJRC", "B000OT6V0U", "B000BT96DC", "B000031EGW", "B000O599ZS", "B00AEFXUL2", "B00AJCUL0I", "B000EXDSCU", "B00018D404", "B0018O4RT2", "B000EHSVUU", "B00008CMT4", "B000056H2J", "B00195I3OK", "B00005JLV5", "B000GFRI4K", "B0008KLVA0", "B00005YUNT", "B00008CMT3", "B00004TJQK", "B0007TKNLA", "B000OPOANO", "B005AMJ31U", "B0045HCJSK", "B004GJYRBY", "B003RHZ666", "6304696612", "B00005LOL5", "B00008MTW5", "B000A1OG18", "B00006672R", "B004GSVX8A", "B00008CMR6", "B00195I3PE", "B000TGJ82Q", "B00005JLUH", "B005AMJ38S", "B0007MANYY", "B000O78L00", "B0007TKNH4", "B00005LOL0", "B000FTCLQC", "B002Y26UJW", "B004CQZFH6", "B000EHSVSW", "B00195I3P4", "B0007QS24S", "B00393SG0G", "6304698801", "B000BT96DM", "B00008LDO3", "B002LII6PU", "6304711905", "B000274TKI", "B00008CMRL"], "bought_together": ["B0045HCJTO", "B00AEFYSEA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFYSEA", "B00AEFYPHA", "B0045HCJTO", "B000059TFW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 243235}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 29.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0767827678", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21H4DPV9MGL.jpg", "title": "The Professionals"}

{"description": "Akira Kurosawa's sequel toYojimbois more lighthearted and less cynical, a rousing adventure with Toshir&ocirc; Mifune reprising his role as the scruffy mercenary who becomes an unlikely big brother to a troupe of nine naive samurai. Shuffling into a secret meeting where the proud young men discuss the graft choking their clan, Mifune's Sanjuro scratches his scraggly beard and distractedly rubs his neck like some common peasant while giving them advice on appearances and truths: \"People aren't what they seem,\" he warns the dubious lads. \"Be careful.\" Naturally they aren't, and Sanjuro grudgingly adopts the well-meaning but hopelessly ill-equipped heroes, giving the starry-eyed youths a series of lessons in real-world honor and respect while saving their skins from reckless attacks and impulsive plans. It isn't the subtlest of Kurosawa's films--the repetitious lessons and speeches delivered to the thickheaded samurai are rather obvious--but it's one of his most entertaining. Mifune, gruffly at ease with the boys, is hilariously discomforted in the presence of a cultured lady, who sees through his shaggy exterior and imparts a little wisdom of her own. Mifune bounds into action in a number of impressive sword fights--wonderfully choreographed lightning-quick battles in which Mifune leaps all over the widescreen image--but an increasing sense of waste, of futility, hangs over the action scenes, culminating in a tense but meaningless duel of honor. The accompanying trailer on the DVD features brief behind-the-scenes glimpses of Kurosawa directing Mifune through an action sequence.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000G8NXYG", "B00005B1ZL", "B001BEK8E2", "B002E01MBA", "B00K5EJHGO", "B00005JLEJ", "B00180R072", "B000AQKUD6", "B000067IY6", "B0007989YS", "B00000K0DM", "B007N5YK10", "B00005JLMU", "B00687XNNK", "6305028699", "B0009WIE2A", "0780021045", "0780021061", "B000ASATM6", "B001WLMOL4", "B000BB14I0", "B000C6NP7M", "B005D0RDPM", "B00004Y7HL", "B000BR6QCI", "B000XPSC0C", "B005JJCMN0", "B0001UZZSG", "B000NOK0H6", "B004XQO8MS", "B002ZG4Q5W", "B006H3KQSK", "B000AQKUGI", "B000056NWP", "B00005QAPH", "B000PC6Z48", "B0017MO0U6", "B0001VO38S", "B00019JR5Y", "B0000B1ODS", "B000E5LEV0", "B00004W3HF", "B00000C0QO", "B00005NC66", "B001PCNZJU", "B000FS9FIK", "B00B2BYXSQ", "B00065GX0K", "B000AQKUG8", "B002BWP4A6", "0792841409", "6305257450", "B003N2CVQ8", "B002AFX53W", "B00000CQJZ", "B004KDYR7A", "B000AQKUC2", "B003KGBISY", "B003VA3JTA", "B00005JLV7", "B003WKL6XA", "B00009V7OB", "6304698798", "B0000A02TW", "B005D0RDCU", "B005152C7S", "B000AQKUH2", "B000WEH74G", "B0007GAG42", "B00AEFYSEA", "B000059TFW", "B008CJ0JS4", "B000FDECGA", "B007Y1NR1W", "B00005UQ7T", "078002205X", "0792839056", "0780020707", "B0080WPADW", "B001LMU1C8", "B00AQ6J64O", "B000025RE7", "B0002V7O0Q", "0783225903", "B001O549G6", "B007K7IAYY", "B004NWPY20", "B000BQ5J18", "B000065V38", "B001LMU1B4", "B00DHN8FXG", "B00065GX64", "B000I8OOG0", "0780022343", "B0049985XW", "B000055Y0X", "B0026VBOJC", "0780022041", "B00GBT62N8", "B00005A8TX"], "bought_together": ["B000G8NXYG", "B001BEK8E2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000K0YM0Y", "B000G8NXYG", "B00008RH1H", "B001BEK8E2"]}, "price": 24.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 185087}, "asin": "0780022491", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KN3PM18EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sanjuro (The Criterion Collection)"}

{"description": "Heavy-metal golf with Adam Sandler, a 1996 dry run of the wild-man-athlete formula that paid off so handsomely inThe Waterboy. There are some irresistibly funny sequences, although you may hate yourself for laughing at the mean-spirited slapstick. This isn't a classic golf comedy, like the Bill Murray vehicleCaddyshack, but as a hot-tempered would- be hockey player who finds an unexpected m&#xE9;tier as a power golfer, Sandler has a short-fuse shtick that's effectively deployed. He's like a punk rocker gleefully out of his element, puncturing the country-club atmosphere by using the fairway as a private mosh pit. The action gets repetitive beyond the midpoint, and a subplot involving Gilmore's lovable grandma and her problems with the IRS is dismayingly sappy. Sandler's iconoclasm is mostly window dressing; there's no conceptual or satirical daring in his kind of \"outrageousness.\" The strong supporting cast includes Christopher McDonald as Gilmore's smug rival on the links, Julie Bowen as a perky publicist, and, in a memorable bout of fisticuffs with our hero, game-show host Bob Barker. Director Dennis Dugan  (Problem Child) himself plays Doug Thompson, the golf-tour supervisor.--David Chute", "related": {"also_bought": ["0788816454", "6300989003"], "bought_together": ["0788816454"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 177944}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.49, "brand": "", "asin": "0783219105", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G6A1H2BAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Happy Gilmore [VHS]"}

{"description": "Who would have guessed that this clever, fast-paced creature feature from 1990 would become a beloved miniclassic?Tremorsdidn't actually break any new ground (even though its tunneling worm monsters certainly did), but it revved up the classic monster-movie formulas of the 1950s with such energetic enthusiasm and humor that it made everything old seem new again. It's also got a cast full of enjoyable actors who clearly had a lot of fun making the film, and director Ron Underwood strikes just the right balance of comedy and terror as a band of small-town rednecks battles a lot of really nasty-looking giant worms. The special effects are great, the one-liners fly fast and furious between heroes Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward (and yes, that's country star Reba McEntire packin' awesome firepower), and it's all done with the kind of flair one rarely associates with goofy monster flicks like this.

{"description": "Meet Joe Blackseemed almost fated to fail when it was released in 1998, but this romantic fantasy--a remake of 1934'sDeath Takes a Holiday--deserves a chance at life after box-office death. Although many moviegoers were turned off by director Martin Brest's overindulgent three-hour running time, those who gear into its deliberate pace will find thatMeet Joe Blackoffers ample reward for your attention.Brad Pitt plays Death with a capital D, enjoying some time on Earth by inhabiting the body of a young man who'd been killed in a shockingly sudden pedestrian-auto impact. Before long, Death has ingratiated himself with a wealthy industrialist (Anthony Hopkins) and pursues romance with the man's beautiful daughter (newcomer Claire Forlani), whom he'd briefly encountered while still an earthbound human. Under the assumed identity of \"Joe Black,\" he samples all the pleasures that corporeal life has to offer--power, romance, sex, and such enticing pleasures as peanut butter by the spoonful.But Death has a job to do, andMeet Joe Blackaddresses the heart-wrenching dilemma that arises when either father or daughter (the plot keeps us guessing) must confront his or her inevitable demise. The film takes its own sweet time to establish this emotional crisis and the love that binds Hopkins's semidysfunctional family so closely together. But if you've stuck with the story this far, you may find yourself surprisingly affected. And ifMeet Joe Blackhas really won you over, you'll more than appreciate the care and affection that gives the film a depth and richness that so many critics chose to ignore.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0800135954", "B00005PJ8I"], "bought_together": ["0800135954"], "also_viewed": ["6304151306"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 485735}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.01, "brand": "", "asin": "078322706X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51yPbLwH%2BFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Meet Joe Black [VHS]"}

Instead of detailing each scene ofOut of Africa, for example, Pollack  paints in broad strokes, talking about cinematic themes and in particular the translation of Karen Blixen's life in Africa from book to film. The fan of flubs and trivia won't find Pollack making any cute remarks, but he's  certainly interesting for the run of the film, describing the location shooting in Africa and how he dealt with Robert  Redford's casting and lack of accent. The new 45-minute documentaryA Song of Africahas old and new interviews with Pollack and Meryl Streep, who clearly should have shared the film's commentary duties; she's insightful and quite fun to listen to.

{"description": "Thanks to repeated showings on cable television and home video, this speculative thriller has built quite a loyal following since its release in 1978. The provocative &quot;what if?&quot; scenario still packs a punch, even if it is not always believable. James Brolin, Sam Waterston, and O.J. Simpson star as three astronauts who agree to spare the government embarrassment by faking their historic landing on Mars after their spacecraft is determined to be unsafe for blastoff. When a scheming mission controller (Hal Holbrook) plots to kill the astronauts in a staged capsule fire, the trio embarks on a dangerous mission to expose the truth. Elliott Gould costars as the journalist determined to crack the conspiracy, and director Peter Hyams turns up the tension with an exciting chase sequence involving Telly Savalas as an eccentric barnstormer who comes to Gould's aid.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000CGNEE", "B0045HCJKS", "B00008438U", "B0003JAOO0", "B000063UR1", "B000096IAC", "B004LB5FDG", "B00CPTUOI2", "B0013LL2Z2", "B001BGS17Q", "B000O78KWE", "B005FQ2H8W", "B000P0J0BU", "B0016I0AJG", "B0016B6ZJW", "B0045HCJ9O", "B00005JP4N", "B000SFJ4K4", "B0027BKC9E", "B00AEBB94G", "B00021R7CG", "B00CFHEFSO", "B0045HCJSA", "B0006B2A42", "B0045HCJ8A", "6305869103", "0784011338", "B00004XPPE", "B0040BJH54", "B0001FGC1U", "B004VT9JMG", "B00AJXO3S8", "B0001I55SS", "B00AEBB8VK", "B0000AMRUP", "B00009AOBJ", "B00005JKFR", "B00AFEYS9A", "B0050MB5N4", "B006MFQ4OS", "B000087F6L", "0783231032", "B00079HZS4", "6305761078", "B00KIZY2QA", "B000NTPG7K", "B000AYELJ2", "B002GHHHKQ", "B000FVQLKW", "B002VA5A02", "B00007JMD8", "B003O7I6SE", "B00007GZRI", "B0000648YD", "B00008OE4W", "B001KO1BCG", "B00003CWU3", "B0002CR03Q", "B000BOH8Y6", "B0045HCJ76", "B000RXVNCY", "B00441GYYC", "B00009NHC0", "B000HEWEDK", "B00004TX5G", "6305869359", "B0000648ZQ", "6305869367", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B00A92MFQG", "B00D9EJFZA", "B001993Y1S", "B0002V7O3I", "B004IFYMXO", "B001KP2J3U", "B000XJD34I", "B003ASLJMW", "0792841670", "B004LB5FAO", "B00008MTW1"], "bought_together": ["B0000CGNEE", "B00008438U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0045HCJKS", "B00008438U", "B000096IAC", "B0000CGNEE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 103386}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "BROLIN,JAMES", "asin": "0784011540", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VVFT679ML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Capricorn One"}
{"description": "It always comes up when people are comparing their most traumatic movie experiences: \"the death of Bambi's mother,\" a recollection that can bring a shudder to even the most jaded filmgoer. That primal separation (which is no less stunning for happening off-screen) is the centerpiece ofBambi, Walt Disney's 1942 animated classic, but it is by no means the only bold stroke in the film. In its swift but somehow leisurely 69 minutes,Bambicovers a year in the life of a young deer. But in a bigger way, it measures the life cycle itself, from birth to adulthood, from childhood's freedom to grown-up responsibility. All of this is rendered in cheeky, fleet-footed style--the movie doesn't lecture, or make you feel you're being fed something that's good for you. The animation is miraculous, a lush forest in which nature is a constantly unfolding miracle (even in a spectacular fire, or those dark moments when \"man was in the forest\"). There are probably easier animals to draw than a young deer, and the Disney animators set themselves a challenge with Bambi's wobbly glide across an ice-covered lake, his spindly legs akimbo; but the sequence is effortless and charming. If Bambi himself is just a bit dull--such is the fate of an Everydeer--his rabbit sidekick Thumper and a skunk named Flower more than make up for it. Many of the early Disney features have their share of lyrical moments and universal truths, butBambiis so simple, so pure, it's almost transparent. You might borrow a phrase from Thumper and say it's downright twitterpated.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["155890641X", "0788812807", "6302642248", "0788802194", "6302320402", "6304401132", "078881172X", "6304500831", "6303314015", "6300274195", "0788812408", "6302526574", "6302787068", "6302961572", "6300274268", "6305229449", "6303983812", "0788803743", "6304089767", "B0000AQZYM", "B000035Z2S", "6305319138", "6300275310", "0788805843", "0788805533", "6303929338", "6302158095", "6302178924", "6304100507", "B00005JKDQ", "6304400551", "6305326940", "6304290888", "6304978286", "6304400225", "6305940932", "B00004R99N", "6303036813", "6301390725", "B00003CX7L", "B0000E32WB", "6304089201", "B00000ICHA", "B000B8QG3G", "B0000524CZ", "6302426200", "6304501153", "B00003CXQX", "B00005T7H6", "1558906150", "6300274608", "B00000JS61", "6303534422", "B0009SUS4Q", "6304400381", "B00004R99I", "B000009CTR", "6302484359", "6301991311", "B00005RDVV", "B0007A2GSM", "B00003CXHR", "0788811002", "B000035Z46", "B00005RRG3", "6300276554", "6303122647", "6303123244", "6304401736", "0788812181", "B00006IUM9", "1558901892", "6301948106", "6305942285", "6300277003", "B00003CWPW", "6304015127", "B00007AJLB", "B00005JL95", "0788810634", "6304873441", "6303295614", "6303939015", "0783236689", "6304117752", "B00016JF2W", "B000BAVLYS", "0788812440", "B0002YLCHE", "6302481805", "6304155972", "6303991408", "B00008Y47S", "B00003CXXI", "B000B8QG4A", "6302961661", "B00003CXQ6", "B0001I55VK", "B00004YNUH"], "bought_together": ["155890641X", "0788802194"], "also_viewed": ["155890641X", "0788802194", "6303314015", "0788812408", "6304500831", "6302526574", "6302320402", "078881172X", "6302642248", "6302787068", "0788812807", "6300274195", "6304401132", "6302961572", "6304089767", "6300274268", "0788805843", "B000035Z2S", "6304290888", "0788805533", "6305319138", "6303983812", "6305229449", "6303929338", "6300275310", "6302178924", "6304400551", "B0000AQZYM", "6302158095", "6303534422", "B00005JKDQ", "B0007KTBIU", "6305326940", "B00003CXQX", "6304501153", "6303036813", "B000B8QG3G", "6304100507", "B00004R99N", "6305940932", "B00003CXHR", "6304978286", "B000035Z46", "B00005JL95", "B00005RDVV", "B005JQFQ5Y", "B00003CX7L", "6304873441", "6304089201", "6304400225", "6302426200", "6301991311", "6304401736", "0788811002", "B0000524CZ", "6300274608", "6301390725", "B00016JF2W", "B00004REYY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 63167}, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Children's Music", "Disney"], ["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.94, "brand": "Disney", "asin": "0788806270", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DVF3SBVRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bambi (Walt Disney's Masterpiece) [VHS]"}
{"description": "From the moment that Prince Eric's ship emerged from the fog in the opening credits it was apparent that Disney had somehow, suddenly recaptured that \"magic\" that had been dormant for thirty years. In the tale of a headstrong young mermaid who yearns to \"spend a day, warm on the sand,\" Ariel trades her voice to Ursula, the Sea Witch (classically voiced by Pat Carroll), for a pair of legs. Ariel can only succeed if she receives true love's kiss in a few day's time and she needs all the help she can from a singing crab named Sebastian, a loudmouth seagull, and a flounder.

{"description": "Stanley Kubrick dissects the nature of violence in this darkly ironic, near-future satire, adapted from Anthony Burgess's novel, complete with \"Nadsat\" slang. Classical music-loving proto-punk Alex (Malcolm McDowell) and his \"Droogs\" spend their nights getting high at the Korova Milkbar before embarking on \"a little of the old ultraviolence,\" such as terrorizing a writer, Mr. Alexander (Patrick Magee), and gang raping his wife (who later dies as a result). After Alex is jailed for bludgeoning the Cat Lady (Miriam Karlin) to death with one of her phallic sculptures, Alex submits to the Ludovico behavior modification technique to earn his freedom; he's conditioned to abhor violence through watching gory movies, and even his adored Beethoven is turned against him. Returned to the world defenseless, Alex becomes the victim of his prior victims, with Mr. Alexander using Beethoven's Ninth to inflict the greatest pain of all. When society sees what the state has done to Alex, however, the politically expedient move is made.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790734079", "0790705141", "B00004U8PA", "B00000FZCU", "6303953425", "6304484054", "0783235607", "6304039220", "630268644X", "B00006G8O1", "0790700506", "B0002G2B2W", "6305576173", "B000059HCI", "B00008X5J1", "0792837797", "B00000J2KZ", "6300267881", "6301977742", "6300216713", "6300269132", "B00000I1DI", "6302783356", "6300214826", "6305095566", "B00005JLET", "6302054982", "0800103106", "6302201845", "6302798450", "B00000J2L7", "6304994540", "6303686796", "B00005PJ8I", "6300216500", "0783228317", "6303107338", "6304935811", "B00004W5UA", "6302610702", "0783246641", "6300183211", "6302921058", "0792842111", "B00004T37H", "B00002E285", "B00003CXE6", "B000007OY0", "6301971582", "6300184064", "B00005LL26", "0790736039"], "bought_together": ["0790734079", "0790705141"], "also_viewed": ["0393312836", "0790705141", "B0013FSXT6", "B00GGAK0FS", "B008RO875Q", "B004O724M2", "B00004TLMC", "B00023NRSM", "B008M4MB8K", "6305440093", "6303953425", "6303939015", "6303148387", "6303861733", "B00003CXB4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 296220}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790701022", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EV1DQCCGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Clockwork Orange"}
{"description": "Director William Friedkin was a hot ticket in Hollywood after the success ofThe French Connection, and he turned heads (in more ways than one) when he decided to makeThe Exorcistas his follow-up film. Adapted by William Peter Blatty from hiscontroversial bestseller, this shocking 1973 thriller set an intense and often-copied milestone for screen terror with its unflinching depiction of a young girl (Linda Blair) who is possessed by an evil spirit. Jason Miller and Max von Sydow are perfectly cast as the priests who risk their sanity and their lives to administer the rites of demonic exorcism, and Ellen Burstyn plays Blair's mother, who can only stand by in horror as her daughter's body is wracked by satanic disfiguration. One of the most frightening films ever made,The Exorcistwas mysteriously plagued by troubles during production, and the years have not diminished its capacity to disturb even the most stoical viewers. The film is presented in letterbox format on digital video disc, with a soundtrack that's guaranteed to curdle your blood.

{"description": "When Tim Burton and Michael Keaton announced that they'd had enough of theBatmanfranchise, director Joel Schumacher stepped in (with Burton as coproducer) to make this action-packed extravaganza starring Val Kilmer as the caped crusader. Batman is up against two of Gotham City's most colorful criminals, the Riddler (a role tailor-made for funnyman Jim Carrey) and the diabolical Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones), who join forces to conquer Gotham's population with a brain-draining device. Nicole Kidman plays the seductive psychologist who wants to know what makes Batman tick. Boasting a redesigned Batmobile and plenty of new Bat hardware,Batman Foreveralso introduces Robin the Boy Wonder (Chris O'Donnell) whose close alliance with Batman led more than a few critics to ponder the series' homoerotic subtext. No matter how you interpret it, Schumacher's take on theBatmanlegacy is simultaneously amusing, lavishly epic, and prone to chronic sensory overload.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001OST0M6", "B000P0J06U", "B000P0J06K", "B00005JNJV", "B004LWZWGA", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00005LOUK", "B0006L0LOS", "B000IJ79X4", "B000IJ79XE", "B001CDR1FG", "B000IJ79WU", "B004YJMQDW", "B000J10EQU", "B00IZZDWKM", "B0000959N0", "B000AYELVA", "B00003CXE4", "B00005JKWJ", "B000AQOHNA", "B004LWZW42", "B00008G8M5", "B000IJ79UW", "0780624890", "B001DHXT20", "B002GSXKN8", "B0009UZG28", "B00005JNTU", "B000AYELVU", "B000A9QKLE", "B000A9QKL4", "B001GCUO1Q", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001VLBDD0", "B008JFUPFI", "B0090SI56Y", "B000068MBS", "B004EPZ07K", "B00081912E", "B005COPWZW", "0783235070", "B00BTYMPUY", "B004SIP9P6", "B000OYC7BW", "B00005JMQW", "B004SIP9O2", "B0007G89FU", "B001QB9H1U", "B000VI70QS", "B0014Z4ON4", "B000NIBURQ", "B001DJLD2G", "B000UR9T8C", "B00K7IPFSM", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000A9QKLO", "B000IJ79VQ", "B00F4FFO8E", "B00005JKCH", "B000ARXF96", "B0007V6ITE", "0790732157", "B0002IQMAM", "B00AEBB9SM", "B00005N5S5", "B000P0J06A", "B00GZ0ML2Y", "B00JL6L4UY", "B001AGXEAG", "B001ECDVKE", "B000GETUDI", "B005LAIHYU", "B008JFUS0U", "B001PPLIEG", "B000W1V5VU", "B001QTXM5Y", "B000HCO83Q", "B004SIP9MY", "6304765258", "B002GOAH1A", "B00JPS7HOA", "B00E5I2MCM", "B005LAIGW8", "B00006FI0R", "B00177YA1K", "B0007P0Y7C", "B001GCUO0W", "B0000B00KB", "B00080ZFZW", "B002GHHHN8", "B003AWRM9W", "B008JFUO72", "B00005JNTI", "B000HT38BM", "B0049IHWYG", "B00JF5GAIW", "B0009RCPY8", "B0000VCZMK", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B005J9ZFQG"], "bought_together": ["B001OST0M6", "B000P0J06U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002GSXKN8", "B000P0J06K", "B000B5XOSO", "B00005JNJV"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 161577}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.18, "brand": "Warner Bros", "asin": "0790731002", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51V0HRD00TL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Batman Forever"}
{"description": "A strong candidate for the designation of most thrilling action movie ever made (the turbo-charged exhilaration of its full-throttle highway chases has never been equaled), the second part of George Miller's post-apocalyptic trilogy is also a magnificently imagined movie myth. Like theStar Warstrilogy (by that other George) theMad Maxfilms draw their inspiration from the works of mythologist Joseph Campbell. In the 1979 original, Max (Mel Gibson) is a policeman, the last guardian of civilization and order in a devastated world reduced to chaos. But when a leather-clad gang of sadomasochistic speed demons mows down Max's family, his remaining connections to humanity are also permanently severed. After brutally exacting his revenge, Max wanders off into the wasteland alone, &quot;a burned out shell of a man&quot; who (to paraphraseThe Searchers) is destined to wander forever between the winds. InThe Road Warrior, Max rediscovers a sliver of his shattered humanity, and a spark of redemption, when he helps an embattled colony of pioneers fight off the savages who are after that most precious of all commodities: &quot;guzzline.&quot; Max is transformed into a legendary hero, just as Mel Gibson was catapulted to international movie stardom. With its final stirring images,The Road Warriortranscends its genre (whatever that may be--science fiction? Western? action adventure?) and becomes something timeless. It's a great movie.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005R2IS", "0790731932", "B00004Y87O", "B00AEFYDM2", "B003XURDAY", "B00005N5S5", "B00005N7Z1", "0783241895", "B001VLBDD0", "B0002CHK1S", "B000QUCQX8", "B000U1ZV8K", "B003ELKNH2", "B0038SUBEG", "B00000ILDD", "B000RW3VCK", "B0068FZ0O2", "B00AKGG828", "B00AEBBADG", "B00003CXC5", "B00I9TDMRM", "B008CYDD7I", "B00D7AM6M0", "B0000AOX0F", "0783227434", "B00005JMEW", "B003ASLJS6", "0783227396", "B002GHHHME", "0767802519", "1558908846", "B000E6ESEO", "0783228457", "6305821216", "B005J9ZFQG", "B0019BI1DM", "B00IBKXSKA", "B0087DFIYA", "B0000VD12I", "B001JFZ118", "B00005JMUA", "B00005JA8B", "B00005A3KS", "B000P0J0D8", "0790729695", "B004SIP8ZM", "B004SIP95G", "B0009UC810", "B0007WQHI0", "B0001Z37HM", "B0006GANN2", "B0045HCJIK", "B00005JLWN", "0767836316", "B0001611DI", "B000A2UBN4", "B000U1ZV7Q", "B000NA1WGS", "0792833244", "B000FS9FE4", "B002I9Z8AS", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B00005JLJW", "B000VECAD0", "6304806434", "B000056PMU", "B0045HCJGC", "B000P0J0BU", "B0045HCJ9O", "B00005ATQB", "B000022TSY", "B001CDR1FG", "B0045HCJT4", "B000CNESNA", "B00000JDIQ", "B00AEFXKUI", "B00026ZG10", "B000NOKFHQ", "B008Y1YK9Y", "6304698798", "B00004XPPG", "6305428115", "0783225946", "0800195175", "B000A7DVR2", "B003AWRMCE", "B0064NTZQ2", "B00070FX5U", "0792839056", "B000068IEV", "B00005AUK9", "B000WC3864", "B0002CHIKG", "B002AF4Y9G", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B00007AJG4", "B00003CXQA", "B0000A2ZU1", "B00BTYJYR6"], "bought_together": ["B00005R2IS", "0790731932"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BLRXDTQ", "B00005R2IS", "B000NA1WGS", "0790731932"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 19723}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 29.74, "brand": "Road Warrior", "asin": "0790729342", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ndgIMhPTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Road Warrior"}

{"description": "One of the key movies of the 1970s, when exciting, groundbreaking, personal films were still being made in Hollywood, Milos Forman'sOne Flew over the Cuckoo's Nestemphasized the humanistic story at the heart of Ken Kesey's more hallucinogenic novel. Jack Nicholson was born to play the part of Randle Patrick McMurphy, the rebellious inmate of a psychiatric hospital who fights back against the authorities' cold attitudes of institutional superiority, as personified by Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). It's the classic antiestablishment tale of one man asserting his individuality in the face of a repressive, conformist system--and it works on every level. Forman populates his film with memorably eccentric faces, and gets such freshly detailed and spontaneous work from his ensemble that the picture sometimes feels like a documentary. Unlike a lot of films pitched at the &quot;youth culture&quot; of the 1970s,One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nestreally hasn't dated a bit, because the qualities of human nature that Forman captures--playfulness, courage, inspiration, pride, stubbornness--are universal and timeless. The film swept the Academy Awards for 1976, winning in all the major categories (picture, director, actor, actress, screenplay) for the first time since Frank Capra'sIt Happened One Nightin 1931.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002VWNIDG", "B000RTB0R6", "B006TTC5HC", "B000FVQLQQ", "B000P0J0EW", "0767830555", "B0043X1FL8", "B00003CWQR", "B004SIP7ZS", "B003ELKNH2", "B0006GAOJA", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFXN9G", "0767811100", "0792833287", "B004SIP95G", "B0000YEEGM", "B00079Z9VO", "0451163966", "B00AEFYSWM", "B000P0J09M", "B008MIMWP8", "B000EHQU0S", "B006FE83UE", "B000M341QE", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00002VWE0", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002VWNIAY", "B00009W5CA", "0764586629", "B000ZM1MGE", "B00011CZRE", "B000P0J09C", "B0008ENHUI", "B00005V9HH", "B0019L770A", "B0019L21GA", "B00AEBB9CS", "B0050FXDDQ", "B000CNESTE", "B0006GANN2", "B000LP6KNU", "B000P0J0EM", "B00000IQV7", "B000055Y0X", "B00001ZWUS", "079073219X", "B0019UGYK0", "079284646X", "B00AEBB9F0", "B003ASLJO0", "B000A7DVR2", "B00AEBB9FA", "B0002B15ZG", "B004U7MR3M", "B000YAF4MA", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00066FBQG", "B00005JKIS", "6305144168", "B004SIP7TE", "B002ZG980U", "B00005ATQB", "B0045HCJ94", "0783229526", "B000A3XY5A", "B000093FLA", "B00026ZD04", "B004L9GMBC", "B0000DI87S", "B00006RCO1", "B0007PALZ2", "B0000JBALO", "B004IFYMYI", "B007N31YH0", "B000P0J0D8", "B000H4JH7Q", "B00B0U2SFE", "0792846443", "B007D0FVRM", "B000022TSY", "B0087ZG7UW", "B0002234LS", "B0045HCJ9E", "B0000A02TZ", "B001GD6VTE", "B00AEFYRP0", "0784011710", "B00009AOAZ", "B00005JLSB", "B000Q678OO", "0792838408", "6305882592", "B003LMPKSQ", "B00005MEOU", "B00AEFYSL8", "B0057ZAA6W", "B001AEF6BI", "B000HC2LHG"], "bought_together": ["B002VWNIDG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000P0J0EW", "0451163966", "B006TTC5HC", "B00AEFY0F2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 40218}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.24, "brand": "WARNER STUDIOS", "asin": "0790732181", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pJoIlXFbL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"}

{"description": "Inspired by the 1960s TV series that starred James Garner in the title role, this lightweight Western from 1994 proved to be a surprising box-office hit. Well, maybe not such a big surprise, since it's from the star and director of theLethal Weaponmovies, and operates with a similar combination of mainstream plotting and easygoing humor. Mel Gibson stars as card-playing gunslinger Brett Maverick, who meets up with wily gambler Annabelle Bransford (Jodie Foster) and a marshal named Zane Cooper (James Garner, trading his old role to Gibson) on his way to the World Series of poker in St. Louis. Maverick's trying to raise the $5,000 needed to join the high-stakes contest, but that's easier said than done due to a lot of unscrupulous competition and a twisting plot of tricks and deceptions. It's all played for laughs and action, so the movie never wears out its welcome, despite a running time that could've used a good trimming. It's also fun to see the rapport between Gibson and Garner, as if the present and former Mavericks were a kind of surrogate son and father, bonded by their mutual skill in charming and conning their way through tight spots. Director Richard Donner also pays tribute to old Westerns by casting veterans of the genre in cameo roles (including Bert Remsen, Dub Taylor, and Denver Pyle), and Gibson'sLethal Weaponcostar Danny Glover pops in for a surprise appearance. None of this really adds up to much since the movie makes no pretense about taking itself seriously, but that's precisely why audiences found it so entertaining.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0013D8M4E", "B001DDBD4K", "B000FO0AA6", "B00AEBB9WI", "B002GHHHNI", "B002GOAH1A", "B000056H2E", "0790731460", "B000FO0A9W", "B003AWRMBA", "0783227396", "B00DDT0JB0", "B000056H2F", "B007AAF3FK", "6305213283", "B00B00HUC0", "6305236569", "B00007GZR1", "B00158K0QU", "B0003JAOCC", "B000ARXF96", "B00008DDXA", "B002VWNID6", "B00368PSKK", "B00006SFKE", "B000CEV3M8", "6305428077", "B001ECDVJU", "B004CTG6TO", "B000ENC5YW", "B00003CXJ1", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00000IQW5", "B000JJSJPK", "6305127646", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000E5N6LG", "B00005ATZT", "B000BGR1B4", "B000Y11BC6", "0767827813", "B00ALTQRRK", "B001LMAK88", "B000FTCLQC", "B00008G7QH", "B00AEFY4CG", "B002LFQIL2", "B000JYW5BE", "B00AEBB8NS", "0792838408", "B002NZK5UU", "B000683VI4", "B002KE4ZJG", "B00507O3II", "078322740X", "B0001V1M6E", "B002O3Z4XE", "6304765266", "B004ZRFQCG", "B00936A1ZG", "B000XJD3K2", "B000N4RASS", "B000EGDB10", "B00005LOL0", "B00AEFXYOA", "B00AEFYTEY", "B000BF0C8E", "B000N2HD6O", "B000A0GXGA", "B001JFKWE4", "B002XDR5NM", "B004AOECXI", "B008JFURII"], "bought_together": ["B00DDT0JB0", "0790731460"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DDT0JB0", "0790731460", "B007AAF3FK", "B000BGR1B4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 71477}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.69, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "0790731940", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516B6P3CKFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Maverick (Snap Case Packaging)"}

The movie begins by soaring far out into space, then returns dizzyingly to earth until all the stars in the heavens condense into the sparkle in one little girl's eye. It ends with that same girl as an adult (Jodie Foster)--her search having taken her to places beyond her imagination--turning her gaze inward and seeing the universe in a handful of sand.Contacttraces the journey between those two visual epiphanies. Based on Carl Sagan's novel,Contactis exceptionally thoughtful and provocative for a big-budget Hollywood science fiction picture, with elements that recall everything from2001toThe Right Stuff.

Much of it remains open to speculation and interpretation, but whatever conclusions one eventually draws,Contactdeserves recognition as a rare piece of big-budget studio filmmaking on a personal scale.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002V7OI8", "0783225733", "B0045HCJ9O", "B004L9GMBC", "B00008G8LY", "B00003CWU3", "B0045HCJ0S", "B0006FYOTC", "0671004107", "630471193X", "B002O3Z50G", "B000VECAD0", "B004GJYRI2", "630542845X", "B00000G3PA", "B002ZG980U", "B000BYY11Y", "B00005JL3T", "B0000844I8", "B00I116MUC", "B00013RC84", "B0050MB5KM", "B0087F7VSY", "B00008OE4W", "B00006JDVV", "B0015NORDW", "B00004BZIY", "B003AWRMBA", "B00003CXXP", "B00E8G5HQE", "B00IWULQQ2", "B007Y1NNAW", "B0000A2ZO0", "0783225547", "B00005JKFR", "B001BEK8CY", "B000E6ESEO", "0767812166", "B000OA8OK4", "B00007GZR5", "6305133468", "B001GCUO02", "B005LAII3A", "0767805712", "B000NA1WDQ", "B00005JNY3", "B000YDOOHI", "B000ENC5YW", "B002NZK5UU", "079073639X", "B0043X1FL8", "B00000JMOD", "B004SIP9RO", "0783225814", "B00004YA66", "B000FVQLKW", "B00008G8M4", "B00005JOC9", "B000CEV3M8", "B000CEXEWA", "B001BRJZPW", "B001451HXO", "B0045HCJKS", "B007RGAC7G", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00AEFY3MC", "B00000IQW5", "B001ECDVK4", "B004AOECXI", "B0013FDM7E", "B000053VBK", "B002GHHHP6", "B00AEFXPSK", "B0007PLLBU", "B00AEFY0F2", "B002GHHHNI", "B000PGINMQ", "B0007TKNHE"], "bought_together": ["B0002V7OI8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004L9GMBC", "B002ZG980U", "0671004107", "B000VECAD0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 88991}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "0790733226", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412wFQ6h37L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Contact (Snap Case)"}

{"description": "A man is frightened to death by a menacing military helicopter, piloted by two young Texan men who just happen to be the dead man's stepsons,  Dorian and Angus (Luke Wilson and Jake Busey). To complicate matters, the dead man had had an affair with young Sally (Drew Barrymore), a clerk at the local Burger-Matic who didn't know the guy was married. Now she's pregnant and looking for a supportive guy to be her unborn child's potential father. Dorian fits the role quite nicely, but Angus thinks Sally knows about the helicopter incident, and their scheming mother (Catherine O'Hara) is trying to mastermind a cover-up, and....So goes the cleverly amusing plot of this light, character-based romantic comedy, which proves Barrymore's charm and versatility once again, gives O'Hara one of her best roles, and moves right  along at its own amiable pace. Small-town romance combines with darkly tinged comedy (scripted byX-Filesstaffer Vince Gilligan), and first-time director Dean Parisot guides it all with casual assurance. There's nothing going on here that's particularly inspired, but Barrymore and Wilson (an off-screen couple during production) make a delightful pair, and the cast makes the most of some hilarious down-home dialogue. All in all, a very pleasant diversion.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_viewed": ["0790732947", "B0050MB584"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 386601}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790740451", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511KMGMFXGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Home Fries [VHS]"}
{"description": "Iconoclastic director Robert Altman (Nashville,M.A.S.H.), deconstructs and demythologizes Hollywood's typically romantic vision of the Old West in this haunting, breathtaking masterpiece. A stranger, McCabe (Warren Beatty's best performance), the film's nonheroic protagonist, rides into a dead northwest mountain town (to the mournful sounds of Leonard Cohen), possessing ambitious entrepreneurial dreams of expansion. As the town grows, Mrs. Miller (Julie Christie's finest role, as well), a tough madam, arrives and convinces McCabe to join her in a partnership. Neither are typical Western archetypes: McCabe's an insecure braggart, bumbling lover, and horrible businessman, while Mrs. Miller, hardly a whore with a heart of gold, favors her opium pipe to her partner's romantic advances. Altman, meanwhile, buries these central characters within the town's complex, richly detailed tapestry of characters, preferring to eavesdrop on their overlapping conversations and study the bleak, harsh conditions of their lifestyles. At its core, the film addresses the sacrifices of individualism needed in order to build a community, an American concept that the independent Altman views with skeptical irony. The inevitable final shoot-out underscores the theme. Because McCabe refuses to sell the town he built to a corporation, hired bounty hunters are sent. Instead of a showdown at high noon, the finale--one of Altman's most beautiful set pieces--takes place in the snow, guerilla warfare style. As McCabe runs and hides for his life, the town he created preoccupies itself with saving a burning church instead of their creator, while Mrs. Miller, stoned and grinning, detaches herself from either concern. Cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond captures the town's brutal textures in luminous Cinemascope.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004FQX5B6", "6305237115", "6301966015", "1555265952", "6301564456", "630025111X", "630442972X", "6303593135", "6301976126", "6301963911", "0792837339", "0783217528", "0792839153", "6301966430"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 224934}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790741067", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MPYTP5R3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mccabe &amp; Mrs. Miller [VHS]"}

Two hard-luck drifters (Bogart and Holt) and a grizzled prospector (Huston) discover gold. Then greed and paranoia set in.\n\nShot mostly on location in Mexico, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre cost a then-whopping $3 million - and led to a showdown. At that price, Jack Warner argued, the top-billed Bogart shouldn't be bumped off before the finale. But director John Huston stood his ground and went on to win high honors: two Academy Awards for his direction and screenplay. And his father won the Oscar as Best Supporting Actor. Without awards, but with enduring acclaim, is Bogart's performance, transforming before our eyes from a likable hobo to a heartless thug who simmers in his own greed.

Although he made them sound spontaneous, Mel Blanc never ad-libbed: Talented writers crafted his lines.

Highlights include an assassination on a rainy day with the killer escaping into a sea of umbrellas, a group of spies who signal their Dutch contacts by turning windmills against the wind, and an extraordinary climax aboard a plane that crashes into the ocean.

{"description": "Mel Gibson's Oscar-winning 1995Braveheartis an impassioned epic about William Wallace, the 13th-century Scottish leader of a popular revolt against England's tyrannical Edward I (Patrick McGoohan). Gibson cannily plays Wallace as a man trying to stay out of history's way until events force his hand, an attribute that instantly resonates with several of the actor's best-known roles, especiallyMad Max. The subsequent camaraderie and courage Wallace shares in the field with fellow warriors is pure enough and inspiring enough to bring envy to a viewer, and even as things go wrong for Wallace in the second half, the film does not easily cave in to a somber tone. One of the most impressive elements is the originality with which Gibson films battle scenes, featuring hundreds of extras wielding medieval weapons. After Eisenstein'sAlexander Nevsky, Orson Welles'sChimes at Midnight, and even Kenneth Branagh'sHenry V, you might think there is little new that could be done in creating scenes of ancient combat; yet Gibson does it.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004XPQ6", "B00003CXE6", "6303953425", "6304935811", "B0001VL30O", "B000054OW2", "6302415853", "0790741512", "6304071876", "6301792734", "6303168507", "6303942830", "0800125762", "6300183211", "B000007OY0", "B000056BRF", "6300214540", "B000065U6Q", "B00004WIDB", "B00003CXTF", "B00007KK15", "079070546X", "B0000A36J1", "B00000K3AN", "6302482712", "6300263673", "6305169187", "0788811355", "B00003BE3X", "0800116917", "6304414099", "6303020089", "0792133153", "0790744589", "6302909023", "0800132009", "079212569X", "6300185095", "6303313345", "0767819462", "6304259131", "B00000K2SC", "0800199421", "B0001DI5W6", "B00005JLTM", "630018224X", "0790701251", "6304151306", "6303696813", "0790731274", "0792147618", "B00005RIJ3", "6301586026", "6302945089", "0783223218", "6305718792"], "bought_together": ["B00004XPQ6", "B00003CXE6"], "also_viewed": ["0792151712", "6303314015", "6301966988", "6303402348", "B00004WIDB", "0792116887", "6300213668", "0800125762", "B00004XPQ6", "0792842111", "B00003CXTF", "0788812408", "6302526574", "6303215734", "0788806270", "6300183211", "B00004U8P4", "0788802194"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 521725}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.5, "brand": "", "asin": "0792139771", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PF2QYK62L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Braveheart (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}

Wayne plays a career gunfighter in the autumn of his life, trying to hang up his pistols after he discovers he's dying of cancer.  Boarding in the house of an attractive widow (Lauren Bacall) and her son (Ron Howard), Wayne's character opts for peace in his final days but is dogged by his reputation when a handful of killers seeks him out for a final fight. Howard is fine as a fatherless boy who needs the strong mentor the hero represents, and James Stewart--who costarred with Wayne in the greatMan Who Shot Liberty Valance--plays the doctor who gives the big man the bad news. Don Siegel (Invasion of the Body Snatchers) thoughtfully directs a very special and sensitive production.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300181588", "0792110188", "0792106989", "630197705X", "6303192254", "6301802330", "0792105907", "6300269884", "6300182452", "0792838556", "6304457278", "B003ASLJRC", "B001E419N8", "0783222955", "0792102320", "6303599052", "6300183041", "6300181715", "6300988473", "6300268799", "6301967488", "6301797922", "0792107128", "630150528X", "0792837967", "6304457316", "6301798090", "6300268470", "6301718275", "6300215733", "6300216233", "6300208281", "B00004RFFA", "0783216084", "0790731975", "6300269175", "6300215865", "0790751305", "6302909023", "B000GX7MMA"], "bought_together": ["6300181588", "6301802330"], "also_viewed": ["6300181588", "6300269884", "0792110188", "6301736362", "6302320496", "6301802330", "6300988473"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 236081}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.45, "brand": "", "asin": "0792108868", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51891KWXHJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Shootist [VHS]"}

{"description": "When it was released during Hollywood's golden year of 1939,The Wizard of Ozdidn't start out as the perennial classic it has since become. The film did respectable business, but it wasn't until its debut on television that this family favorite saw its popularity soar. And whileOz's TV broadcasts are now controlled by media mogul Ted Turner (who owns the rights), the advent of home video has made this lively musical a mainstay in the staple diet of great American films. Young Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland), her dog, Toto, and her three companions on the Yellow Brick Road to Oz--the Tin Man (Jack Haley), the Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr), and the Scarecrow (Ray Bolger)--have become pop-culture icons and central figures in the legacy of fantasy for children. As the Wicked Witch who covets Dorothy's enchanted ruby slippers, Margaret Hamilton has had the singular honor of scaring the wits out of children for more than six decades. The film's still as fresh, frightening, and funny as it was when first released. It may take some liberal detours from the original story by L. Frank Baum, but it's loyal to the Baum legacy while charting its own course as a spectacular film. Shot in glorious Technicolor, befitting its dynamic production design (Munchkinland alone is a psychedelic explosion of color and d&eacute;cor),The Wizard of Ozmay not appeal to every taste as the years go by, but it's required viewing for kids of all ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005F96UJ6", "B0000VCZKM", "B00E9ZATKI", "0792839749", "B0087F7VSY", "B0090XLDKY", "B002M2Z3BA", "076781326X", "B00C7JGDBW", "B000P0J09W", "B000URDCC6", "B002HK9IDQ", "B0000DZ3EN", "B000RPCK2E", "B000065V42", "B001JV5BF8", "B0000AM6IY", "B00335EQ0E", "B005NFJAZS", "B003VS0CX8", "B0000VCZKW", "0062278010", "B002NZK5SW", "B0010X744G", "B00CQRN3QI", "B0009XT8ME", "B000HT3PGU", "B006VJ1AAI", "B00005RRG7", "B008H6GHEM", "B00GVFJ5QS", "B00HVBB140", "B002VWNIAY", "B000BT970O", "B002CLBJPK", "0060293233", "B00028HBES", "B00322XV8Q", "B00EV1YZ96", "B000AJJNIG", "B00AATV0WS", "B0054OGQM8", "1495421864", "0739060821", "B00AEFXMGU", "0792833759", "B00AMSQBNK", "B000TPTCP0", "B0009X75QU", "B00ITVMMOY", "B00005RRGB", "B0017Q0SJ4", "0767836324", "B004302N2Q", "084318017X", "B001GLX6UI", "B003YBW2Y4", "1402766254", "B00019GHU2", "B00003CXCQ", "B00AMSM9CW", "B00005JG6M", "B0047QLNUY", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B00447L4JG", "0767819659", "B00000JPH6", "B002BIGCXS", "B00G5G7EXY", "B0000AK7AB", "B006FE83UE", "B002VWNIBI", "B00005JL1P", "B001ILFUDC", "0800177258", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00005RDSQ", "B00JHH1ZN8", "B0006IINYQ", "B0015NORDW", "B002GHHHNS", "B0013ND30M", "0792838408", "B001AGXEAG", "B0047CG9F2", "B00006ADD5", "B0013FSL3E", "B00079Z9VO", "B00F6SHECS", "B0008JIJ2E", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00005JN4W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HVBB140", "B005F96UJ6", "B0000VCZKM", "B00I6JOD2S"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 206236}, "asin": "0792833171", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GYW80GAJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Wizard of Oz"}

{"description": "One of the most invigorating period adventures to hit the big screen in decades, this lavish, brilliantly directed film drew critical and audience raves when it was released in 1995. Inspired by historical fact and larger-than-life legend, the intelligently scripted story takes place in Scotland in 1713, when Highland farmer and clan leader Rob Roy MacGregor (Liam Neeson) is forced to borrow money from the duplicitous aristocrat Marquis of Montrose (John Hurt) to help his clan survive a harsh winter.  When Montrose's vile henchman (Tim Roth) schemes to dishonor MacGregor and his wife (Jessica Lange) and take the money for himself, the rugged Highlander must take courageous action to preserve his integrity. What follows--along with some of the finest sword-fighting ever filmed--is a tale of courage and valor destined to become an enduring movie classic. Tim Roth received a well-deserved Oscar nomination (for Best Supporting Actor) for his indelible performance as the foppish but deadly villain Cunningham, and both Neeson and Lange bring an earthy, sensual quality to their passionate roles. Boasting a wealth of breathtaking scenery and high-intensity action,Rob Royis further blessed by a splendid supporting cast (including Brian Cox and Eric Stoltz), and the lush soundtrack by Carter Burwell strikes a perfect balance of romanticism and vigorous dramatic energy.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFXKUI", "B000A2WP7O", "6305558167", "B000000W7K", "0790729407", "B00004XPPG", "B003498SCQ", "B00AEFY5B6", "B002O3Z510", "B002VWNID6", "B004AOECXI", "B000NOIVT0", "B00005221M", "B00AMSLDTM", "B003U0AHBO", "076781505X", "B005LAIIRQ", "B0002YLCG0", "B00LG6YEKE", "B00066FB52", "6304711905", "B00AQ5905U", "B00004Y87L", "B003AWRMCE", "B004A8ZX28", "B002O3Z50Q", "0800141601", "B000A2UBN4", "B0064MT1FI", "B00005LOL0", "B002NTDXQ4", "B000ARXF96", "6305692688", "B00BTYJYR6", "B0000TANUI", "0783226810", "6305133409", "B001JFZ118", "B00K7IPFSM", "B001TODCII", "B00B0U2SFE", "B000RF7XYY", "B000RF7XYO", "B00001ZWUS", "B003L20IG0", "B00008L3UM", "0792839137", "B00004WG2F", "B0000EYUCK", "B00AEBBA36", "B000P0J0EW", "B000VKL6ZM", "B000E5N6LG", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B00000JSJC", "B0002V7T6K", "B000005IQX", "B00J5G1P2W", "B0007PALGG", "B00003CXBH", "6305161879", "B00AEBB9UK", "B002O3Z4WK", "B00013RC84", "B002GHHHHO", "B000QXDED6", "B00HOGBXS6", "B004SIP9U6", "B0067EKYAY", "0783225814", "B0007OY2OE", "B00AEFXVCU", "1573623903", "B0000DI87S", "B000AARKOO", "B003XURDAY", "B00004ZBVK", "0800177967", "B000NVKZV0", "6304712987", "6305874867", "B00009W5CA", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004IK30MI", "B000065V3V", "0783240171", "B000ZM1MG4", "B00008IHF2", "B000NOKFHQ", "B000ZOXDFA", "0783225733", "B00004XPPC", "B003LMPKSQ", "B00AEFXD1O", "B000MGB6NM", "B001B187NO", "B0000542C5", "1858815495", "B003AWRMCO", "B00006ADD5"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFXKUI", "B00004XPPG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005221M", "B00003CX95", "B001A6LNHM", "B004AOECXI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 13828}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.35, "brand": "NEESON,LIAM", "asin": "079283366X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41xYlWpnyrL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rob Roy"}

{"description": "Bee girls by nature, maybe, but not by cup size.Price Is  Rightmodel Anitra Ford anchors this enjoyably sleazy horror movie about  women who mate... and kill! Also, they get naked a lot. After a State  Department employee meets a mysterious motel death, agent Agar (Marlboro Man  William Smith) heads to Peckham, CA, to investigate. Soon, highly  unattractive middle-aged men are falling victim to beautiful young women as  quickly as they can drop trou. The women look completely normal except that  they all wear huge sunglasses even in the dark (hmmm...) and are frequently  naked. One could do a tidy thesis on how this 1973 marvel reflected male  fears of newly independent women--sexual and career independence seem to lead  directly to lesbianism and lethal coitus. (Screenwriter Nicholas Meyer also  wroteFatal Attraction.) But why bother intellectualizing when you can  just lie back and let the bad sex puns and horrific '70s soundtrack wash over  you? And try not to worry about why that one woman is naked on her  motorcycle.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["B007V6ON9A"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 582638}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0792843959", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ws7eGLeJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Invasion of the Bee Girls [VHS]"}
{"description": "Winner* of 4 Academy Awards(r), including Best Picture, and based on the first-hand experience of Oscar(r)-winning** director Oliver Stone, Platoon is powerful, intense and starkly brutal. \"Harrowingly realistic and completely convincing\" (Leonard Maltin), it is \"a dark, unforgettable memorial\" (The Washington Post) to every soldier whose innocence was lost in the war-torn jungles of Vietnam.  Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) is a young, naive American who, upon his arrival in Vietnam, quickly discovers that he must do battle not only with the Viet Cong, but also with the gnawing fear, physical exhaustion and intense anger growing within him. While his two commanding officers (Oscar(r)-nominated*** Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe) draw a fine line between the war they wage against the enemy and the one they fight with each other, the conflict, chaos and hatred permeate Taylor, suffocating his realities and numbing his feelings to man's highest value life.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790701251", "630018627X", "6300214826", "6304935811", "B003ELKNH2", "B00006C7G9", "6302935148", "0800132009", "630407185X", "0783235607", "6304259131", "B00000K3AN", "6300270548", "B000E3UMB0"], "bought_together": ["0790701251", "630018627X"], "also_viewed": ["B0015D20FE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 438643}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.12, "brand": "", "asin": "0792845129", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FTFZXBBML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Platoon [VHS]"}

{"description": "A box-office hit when released in 1994, this sprawling, frequently overwrought familial melodrama may get sillier as its plot progresses, but it's the kind of lusty, character-based epic that Hollywood should attempt more often. It's also an unabashedly flattering star vehicle for Brad Pitt as Tristan--the rebellious middle son of a fiercely independent Montana rancher and military veteran (Anthony Hopkins)--who is routinely at odds with his more responsible older brother, Alfred (Aidan Quinn), and younger brother, Samuel (Henry Thomas). From the battlefields of World War I to his adventures as an oceangoing sailor, Tristan's life is full of personal torment, especially when he returns to Montana and finds himself competing with Alfred over Samuel's beautiful widow (Julia Ormond), whose passion for Tristan disrupts the already turbulent Ludlow clan. Under the wide-open canopy of Big Sky country, this operatic tale unfolds with all the bloodlust, tragedy, and scenery-chewing performances you'd expect to find in a hokey bestselling novel (in fact, it's based on the acclaimed novella by Jim Harrison), but it's a potent mix that's highly entertaining. Not surprisingly, John Toll won an Academy Award for his breathtaking outdoor cinematography.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0800121600", "0783230893", "6302415853", "B0000214F3", "B00329TVQA", "6301963911", "6304119046", "0790734079", "6300185095", "6300182304", "6304258984", "6304147139", "1558807381", "6301586026"], "bought_together": ["0800121600"], "also_viewed": ["6302130379", "0767836359"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 342881}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.74, "brand": "", "asin": "0800135954", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HTKHKV7SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Legends of the Fall [VHS]"}
{"description": "Bill Murray does warmth in his most consistently effective post-Stripescomedy, a romantic fantasy about a wacky weatherman forced to relive one strange day over and over again, until he gets it right. Snowed in during a road-trip expedition to watch the famous groundhog encounter his shadow, Murray falls into a time warp that is never explained but pays off so richly that it doesn't need to be. The elaborate loop-the-loop plot structure cooked up by screenwriter Danny Rubin is crystal-clear every step of the way, but it's Murray's world-class reactive timing that makes the jokes explode, and we end up looking forward to each new variation. He squeezes all the available juice out of every scene. Without forcing the issue, he makes us understand why this fly-away personality responds so intensely to the radiant sanity of the TV producer played by Andie MacDowell. The blissfully clueless Chris Elliott (Cabin Boy) is Murray's nudnik cameraman.--David Chute", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004RJ73", "B00287Z18Y", "6305609764", "B00005PJ6O", "B007P9HW3M", "0790740044", "B00AEFXXMI", "0783227388", "6305236569", "B00000IQBW", "B000E33W1W", "0804141444", "B0009RCPY8", "B0019HQICW", "B001AGXEAG", "B00AEFXDO6", "0767818105", "0792844890", "B002O3Z4YI", "B0000A14TA", "B0014Z4OMU", "B000K7VHTQ", "B00AEBBA2M", "B00005Y71F", "B00AEBB9SM", "B002GOAGZC", "B000G6BLW4", "B001IHJ988", "B00008G8LM", "B001LXIDVI", "B000QQLVPQ", "B005LL817W", "B001LMAK9W", "B00AEBB9DM", "0767806808", "B008R65XKQ", "B000G6BLWE", "B00003CXC3", "B00005O5CM", "B000065V3P", "B00005JM4Q", "B00AEBB9E6", "B000ELJAEM", "B00AEFYS2M", "B00AEFY0F2", "0767836324", "B002T51X4Q", "0800195175", "B0009X760U", "B000A3XYIM", "B000VBIGD6", "B000069HYF", "B00003CXR4", "0790742071", "B00AEFY3MC", "B000PHVZNE", "B0000YTP02", "B000E6ESI0", "B000YDBPAM", "B007Y1NR1W", "B00158K0QU", "B00006FMUW", "B00BLN4UPG", "B00AEFYM2S", "B000HT3PPG", "B000056HEA", "B000068NNU", "B0045HCJ7G", "B000V4UFZK", "B004GJYRA0", "B004AOECXI", "B000YAF4MA", "B00AEFXPG2", "B0045HCIY0"], "bought_together": ["B00004RJ73", "B00287Z18Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004RJ73", "B00005PJ6O", "B000E33W1W", "B00287Z18Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 107101}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.42, "brand": "", "asin": "080017948X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21XPDM6RK1L.jpg", "title": "Groundhog Day"}
{"description": "This didn't turn out to be quite the deserving American vehicle for Hong Kong action superstar Chow Yun-fat that it should have been. But it is an entertaining potboiler about a hired gun (Chow) who fails to carry out an assignment to kill a cop (which would leave the fellow's son without a father), and becomes a target himself when the contract is handed over to other assassins. Mira Sorvino plays a document forger who is drawn into the fray, pairing up with the hero as they fight their way out of bad spots. The whole enterprise is a little too routine, but the action is sharp and the battles are imaginative and crisp. Director Antoine Fuqua has a by-the-numbers feeling for the influence of Hong Kong on contemporary thrillers (this film was also produced by John Woo), and that's enough to makeThe Replacement Killerspurely enjoyable if not exactly a revelation.--Tom Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 467787}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0800123719", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71PG0M64B0L._SY300_.gif", "title": "The Replacement Killers [VHS]"}
{"description": "Francis Ford Coppola returns to Stoker's novel for this umpteenth take of the Transylvanian bloodsucker. Gary Oldman plays the vampire, Dracula, doomed to be a creature of the night after forsaking God but aroused by the image of a British woman (Winona Ryder) who resembles his own lost love. Oldman does well by the monster, even if he doesn't register much personality in the process, and Anthony Hopkins is a little overachieving as the vampire killer Van Helsing. The rest of the cast is serviceable, except Keanu Reeves, who--not atypically--is wooden and somehow empty. Coppola seems to approach the film as chunks of experimental opportunity, some of which work out all right while others are mannered or even foolish.

{"description": "Regardless of whether it was \"too early\" in 2006 to dramatize the events of September 11th, 2001, \"World Trade Center\" succeeds as a tribute to the courage and sacrifice of those who served at \"ground zero\" in the wake of terrorist attacks on the WTC's twin towers in New York City. Removed from the politics of war and terrorism (yet still, like all films, inherently political in expressing its point of view), Oliver Stone's potent drama focuses on the nightmarish ordeal, and subsequent rescue, of Port Authority policemen John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and Will Jimeno (Michael Pe?a), who were buried deeply within the rubble of the WTC after the twin towers collapsed. Granted, it's only the film's historical context that distinguishes it from any other dramatic rescue story, but in focusing on the goodness of humanity in response to the evil of terrorists who remain unnamed and off-screen, Stone and first-time screenwriter Andrea Berloff create an emotional context as powerful as anything Stone has directed since \"Platoon\". Even as he resorts to some questionable tactics typically lacking in subtlety, Stone refrains from much of the blunt-force filmmaking that has made him a critical punching bag, rising to this challenging occasion with a heartfelt and deeply American portrait of unity ' personal, familial, and national. Flaws and all, \"World Trade Center\" serves an honorable purpose, reminding us all that for those fleeting days in September 2001, America showed its best face to a sympathetic world. --\"Jeff Shannon\"", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000GH3CR0", "B000EYJHDS", "B0006L0L5C", "0783223609", "B001F5274G", "B004X7UAMO", "B004WCSMDE", "B0000B1OBZ", "B008L0YN4U", "B005KBJC0I", "B00006B1HI", "B001MVWFAO", "B00AEBB8JM", "B00827OX5Q", "B00K2CHX9C", "B00K2CHW48", "B00006BS70", "B00003CXTG", "B00005JN5E", "B000065U1N", "B005VU9KW8", "B00006409F", "B000065Q9C", "B00AEBBA36", "B00AEFYENK", "B000KF0GWW", "B00063MCHA", "B004XFZ4JK", "B0013BM63O", "B00000G3PA", "B001MVYUR0", "B005DR64OQ", "B00005JK8K", "B00102F5WK", "B00005JM0O", "B0002V7ON8", "B004EPYZOO", "B007IUEEA2", "B000ELL1R6", "B000BBOUW2", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B000OVLBF8", "B000HRMAPE", "B003BV8ICM", "B000MGB6NM", "B001J710Z2", "B00005JMXX", "B001GCUO02", "B0015D20FE", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00005PJ8T", "B0077ATSSQ", "B001N44BVQ", "B008JFUNKU", "B00BUH1QHS", "B005F2JRUC", "B0002ZSKMS", "B004FQX59I", "B000GRUMRS", "B000FWHW7C", "B00AZNEW5G", "079284646X", "B00BTYMPX6", "B000059TG6", "B00012QLB4", "B00004Z4WR", "B000FUF6QI", "B007XF0W9O", "B00260HH2G", "B00008G8M4", "B000M4RG42", "B003ASLJQS", "B001SGEUYW", "B00GSBQ2HU", "B000JYW5DW", "0783225733", "B004A2AN5G", "B000BYA5G4", "B000A3XY5A", "B00001ZWUS", "B000EGDB10", "B0007KIFGE", "B000ZS8GWQ", "B00005JLRE", "6304711891", "6304806434", "B002NZK5VO", "B000P0J0C4", "B002O3Z50G", "B005LAIGYQ", "B002NXSRVG", "B00DZP1C2W", "B00005JNEI", "B00HEPE6MM", "B001HQZJMU", "B00HW3LAF2", "0800177967", "B000P0J09C", "B00AEFXGIY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000GH3CR0", "B0006L0L5C", "B000EYJHDS", "B001F5274G"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 748872}, "asin": "1415726698", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F3dNW-7-L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "World Trade Center"}

{"description": "Director Marty DiBergi (Rob Reiner) solemnly alerts us to the glory that was Spinal Tap in his introduction to this \"rockumentary\" about the legendary British heavy-metal group, featuring lead guitarist Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest), lead singer David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean), bassist Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer), and a succession of drummers whose careers were cut short by spontaneously combusting on their stool, drowning in somebody else's vomit, or otherwise perishing in untimely fashion. Under DiBergi's studious interrogation, the band and their familiars retrace the band's evolution from head-bopping Mersey Beat poseurs to head-banging metal poseurs, each change in musical direction or tonsorial chic having little effect on the surviving trio's sublime idiocy. For, as St. Hubbins (he's the \"deep\" one, relatively speaking) sagely observes, \"It's such a fine line between stupid and clever.\"Happily for us, director Reiner, who developed the underlying story line with Guest and former Credibility Gap pranksters McKean and Shearer, stays squarely on the right side of the line, even as his writer-actors remain hilariously trapped on the other side. In lieu of a formal shooting script, the quartet created an extensive and detailed band history ripe with the sort of dead-pan detail that hard-core rock historians and screwball aficionados will savor on countless replays; with the three Tap members also musicians themselves, the \"band\" developed its stage act under the unsuspecting noses of L.A. club denizens, who accepted them as just as loud, flashy, sexist, and obvious as any other mullet-tressed, leather-garbed brigade of guitar slingers, circa 1984. The resulting footage thus manages to lob its punch lines and build its characters (including some thinly veiled character assassinations of various industry folks) with a loose, tossed-away verve rooted in the improvisational approach.This Is Spinal Tapremains the funniest, and most truthful, look at rock culture ever filmed and a personal best for all involved.--Sam Sutherland", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 99031}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "This Is Spinal Tap (The Criterion Collection)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000ALFVD", "B00005ALS0", "B00005LC5D", "B000M341Q4", "B00005O3VC", "B000A7DVR2", "B00006HAWL", "B000VE439Y", "B00AEFXDO6", "B0000A02TZ", "B002RVZV9K", "B003CRM6PA", "B00004WGVQ", "B0009298N4", "B000A2UBNE", "B0009UC810", "B000LP6KNU", "B00006LPGP", "B00029RTCG", "B000055Y0X", "B0006GANPA", "B00003CXZ4", "B000MMMT9G", "B002DLB1IO", "B00006D295", "B00AEFYVMO", "B00007AJF8", "B00000ILDD", "B00003CXC3", "B00005A06N", "B0009IOR5M", "B0001Z4OXS", "B0000640VJ", "B004ALIG4M", "B000PAAJZ6", "B00005O06J", "B004L9GMBC", "B002HMHSJ0", "1559408677", "B0010YSD8Q", "B00AEFYR3C", "0780618564", "0767833988", "B004P9UWM8", "B003ELKNH2", "B000ROALGW", "B000HT3QBO", "B00000F3CD", "B0008JIJ2O", "B00005K3NU", "B000Z8GZYW", "B0024EWP6W", "B00008J2HC", "0780020707", "B001ECDVKE", "B000XJD33O", "B000CNESU8", "B000RJO578", "B000EGEJIY", "B000ZM1MG4", "0780622561", "B00BQTLVWK", "B00004ZBVO", "B00005B6JZ", "B000G6BLWE", "B0013K1ALE", "B0007UC8Y4", "B003XURDAY", "B0006GAOJA", "B00278FSXM", "0767827724", "B001IHJ988", "0783229526", "B000OHZKJA", "B001WLMOL4", "B000AP04L0", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00003CXGA", "B003YDORO0", "B00004YZFR", "B003O7I6SE", "6305161879", "B00AEBB9DM", "0783241895", "B00009OWJY", "B00005V0XF", "B000A2UBN4", "B002WJHBEU", "6304907729", "0783230338", "B0019UGYK0", "B000H7JCFK", "B000E33W1W", "B000069HZU", "B00H3JHH6Q", "B00AEFXJS6", "B00005JNZU", "B000067IZ3", "B00AEFXE9U", "B0009ZE9VW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005ALS0", "B0000ALFVD", "B000M341Q4", "B0018CMJSU"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71HEEMJV31L._SY300_.gif", "asin": "1559408758"}
{"description": "As critic Roger Ebert observed in his original review ofRan, this epic tragedy might have been attempted by a younger director, but only the Japanese master Akira Kurosawa, who made the film at age 75, could bring the requisite experience and maturity to this stunning interpretation of Shakespeare'sKing Lear. It's a film for the ages--one of the few genuine screen masterpieces--and arguably serves as an artistic summation of the great director's career. In this version of the Shakespeare tragedy, the king is a 16th-century warlord (Tatsuya Nakadai as Lord Hidetora) who decides to retire and divide his kingdom evenly among his three sons. When one son defiantly objects out of loyalty to his father and warns of inevitable sibling rivalry, he is banished and the kingdom is awarded to his compliant siblings. The loyal son's fears are valid: a duplicitous power struggle ensues and the aging warlord witnesses a maelstrom of horrifying death and destruction. Although the film is slow to establish its story, it's clear that Kurosawa, who planned and painstakingly designed the production for 10 years before filming began, was charting a meticulous and tightly formalized dramatic strategy. As familial tensions rise and betrayal sends Lord Hidetora into the throes of escalating madness,Ran(the title is the Japanese character for \"chaos\" or \"rebellion\") reaches a fever pitch through epic battles and a fortress assault that is simply one of the most amazing sequences on film.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301661737", "6303202055", "6303386717", "6303073107", "630296931X", "6301955293", "B000001A5E", "0780018702", "0783217528"], "bought_together": ["6301661737"], "also_viewed": ["6303202055", "6302919649", "6302891272", "6301942647", "6302969697", "6303073107"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 368153}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.87, "brand": "", "asin": "1572522089", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514XW5P94GL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ran [VHS]"}

{"description": "The debut film of director Joel Coen and his brother-producer Ethan Coen, 1983'sBlood Simpleis grisly comic noir that marries the feverish toughness of pulp thrillers with the ghoulishness of even pulpier horror. (Imagine the novels of Jim Thompson somehow fused with the comic tabloidWeird Tales, and you get the idea.) The story concerns a Texas bar owner (Dan Hedaya) who hires a seedy private detective (M. Emmett Walsh) to follow his cheating wife (Frances McDormand in her first film appearance), and then kill her and her lover (John Getz). The gumshoe turns the tables on his client, and suddenly a bad situation gets much, much worse, with some violent goings-on that are as elemental as they are shocking. (A scene in which a character who has been buried alive suddenly emerges from his own grave instantly becomes an archetypal nightmare.) Shot by Barry Sonnenfeld before he became an A-list director in Hollywood,Blood Simpleestablished the hyperreal look and feel of the Coens' productions (undoubtedly inspired a bit by filmmaker Sam Raimi, whoseThe Evil Deadhad just been coedited by Joel). Sections of the film have proved to be an endurance test for art-house movie fans, particularly an extended climax that involves one shock after another but ends with a laugh at the absurdity of criminal ambition. This is definitely one of the triumphs of the 1980s and the American independent film scene in general.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003UESJME", "6300184064", "630347327X", "B00000J2KZ", "6302641888"], "also_viewed": ["B00553K8FY", "6304297564", "6305417806"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 358611}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.3, "brand": "", "asin": "6300184110", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JN74WN7BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blood Simple [VHS]"}

{"description": "This splatter flick, along with John Carpenter'sHalloween, helped spawn the great horror-movie movement of the '80s, not to mentioneightsequels, many of which had nothing to do with the films that preceded them. It also gave birth to Jason Voorhees, one of the three biggest horror-movie psychos of the modern era (the other two beingHalloween's Michael Myers andA Nightmare on Elm Street's Freddy Krueger). Forever duplicated, the originalFriday the 13thpopularized a number of themes and techniques that today are now clich&eacute;s: the increasingly gory murders, the remote forest location, the anonymous and nubile cast, the murderer as cult hero, and, of course, the moral that if you have sex, you will die, very painfully. Still, if you have to see aFriday the 13thmovie, this is the one to check out. A group of eager (and horny) teenagers decide to reopen Camp Crystal Lake, which 20 years earlier was closed after the shocking and mysterious murders of two amorous camp counselors. You can take it from there, as the teens get picked off one by one, during a dark and stormy night; of course, their car won't start and there's no phone. The ending stole shamelessly from Brian De Palma'sCarrie, but it still provides a slight if campy shock. Look for a young Kevin Bacon as the requisite stud--you can tell that's what he is because when the cast appears in swimsuits, he's wearing a Speedo--who's the beneficiary of the film's best murder sequence, an arrowhead to the throat.

{"description": "Maybe it doesn't quite live up to its sterling reputation, and maybe the leading man and director were slightly miscast. But who cares?Roman Holidayis the film that brought Audrey Hepburn to prominence, and the world movie audience went weak at the knees. The endlessly charming Hepburn had her first starring role in this sweet romance, playing a European princess on an official tour through Rome. Frustrated by her lack of connection to the real world, she slips away from her protective handlers and goes on a spree, aided by a tough-guy news reporter (Gregory Peck). Director William Wyler, more at home with such heavy-going, Oscar-winning classics asThe Best Years of Our LivesandBen- Hur, doesn't always keep the champagne bubbles afloat, and the Peck role would have fit Cary Grant like a silk glove. But the film is great fun, the location shooting is irresistible, and Hepburn embodies an image of chic style that would rule for the rest of the fifties. No coincidence: she won an Oscar, and so did veteran costume designer Edith Head.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300215814", "6300215741", "0793910323", "6300215644", "6300215598", "6305282927", "6304178352", "0790743213", "0792840836", "6301586026", "B000059HH1", "6303215734", "155880997X", "6300183513", "079212569X", "6301798503", "6300207919", "B00005ALP2", "079284517X", "6302800420", "0792133153", "B00000F6D1", "6302878527", "6304457383", "0792840844", "630150528X", "630233683X", "6301670140", "0782006779", "0792837630", "6300181405", "0792837096", "6303631851", "630197736X", "6305123616", "B00000F13T", "6301976932", "6301670159", "6303560040", "0792837533", "6301969316", "B000IG9Q4W"], "bought_together": ["6300215814"], "also_viewed": ["6304178352", "6300215814", "6300215598", "B00005ALP2", "0800103106", "6305123616", "0792839846", "B00AEFXLBQ", "B002HK9IDQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 230424}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.98, "brand": "", "asin": "6300215717", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R49Q1Y62L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Roman Holiday [VHS]"}

{"description": "Jack Crabb is the only white survivor of the Battle of Little Big Horn and the centenarian shares his story in this picaresque fable of the Old West. In Arthur Penn's adaptation of Thomas Berger's novel, Dustin Hoffman plays Jack from teen years into old age in a bravura performance. And Jack's story is a fantastic one: captured by Indians as a boy, reared as an Indian, shuttling back and forth between the white and Indian worlds. In the process, he befriends everyone from Wild Bill Hickock to George Armstrong Custer and is a gunslinger, a snake-oil salesman, and an Army scout. This is a solid blend of comedy and tragedy, with a strong statement to make about America's treatment of Native Americans without sermonizing. A terrific cast includes Faye Dunaway, Martin Balsam, and Richard Mulligan.

{"description": "George Lucas's enigmatic feature film debut expands on a student film he made at USC.  Created under the wing of producer Francis Ford Coppola, this movie is a bleak vision of a world in which technology, not man, is the ultimate dictator.  Efficiency overrides every other aspect of human life, as people are reduced to code names and their lives are contained, monitored, and manipulated for the sake of the system. Featuring unsettling performances by Robert Duvall, Donald Pleasance, and Maggie McOmie,THX 1138does not attempt to explain how things became this way; rather, it utilizes the alienation of its characters, the stifling white-on-white imagery of its sterilized society, and the claustrophobic, droning sound design to emphasize the dangers of a world reliant on soulless technology.  Even though this is not a film one will want to take in repeatedly,THX 1138merits attention because it is that rare film that uses images and sounds--rather than relying heavily on  dialogue--to communicate its dark prophecy.--Bryan Reesman", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0040QYROA", "B003XURDAY"], "also_viewed": ["B00E9PMMX0"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 290492}, "asin": "6300269329", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512ZKWBXT9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Thx1138 [VHS]"}

{"description": "A Disney \"classic\" that actually is a classic,Dumboshould be part of your video collection whether or not you have children. The storytelling was never as lean as inDumbo, the songs rarely as haunting (or just plain weird), the characters rarely so well defined. The film pits the \"cold, cruel, heartless\" world that can't accept abnormality against a plucky, and mute, hero. Jumbo Jr. (Dumbo is a mean-spirited nickname) is ostracized from the circus pack shortly after his delivery by the stork because of his big ears. His mother sticks up for him and is shackled. He's jeered by children (an insightful scene has one boy poking fun at Dumbo's ears, even though the youngster's ears are also ungainly), used by the circus folk, and demoted to appearing with the clowns. Only the decent Timothy Q. Mouse looks out for the little guy. Concerns about the un-PC \"Jim Crow\" crows, who mock Dumbo with the wonderful \"When I See an Elephant Fly,\" should be moderated by remembering that the crows are the only social group in the film who act kindly to the little outcast. If you don't mist up during the \"Baby Mine\" scene, you may be legally pronounced dead.--Keith Simanton", "related": {"also_bought": ["0788806270", "6302642248", "155890641X", "0788812807", "6304500831", "0788812408", "0788802194", "078881172X", "6304401132", "6302320402", "6300274268", "6303314015", "6302526574", "6302961572", "6302787068", "6302178924", "6303983812", "6300275310", "6305319138", "B000035Z2S", "6304400551", "6305229449", "6303929338", "6302158095", "0788805843", "6304089767", "0788803743", "6304100507", "B00005JKDQ", "B0000AQZYM", "6302426200", "0788805533", "6303036813", "6304290888", "6301390725", "6305326940", "6304089201", "6300274608", "6304978286", "0788812440", "6301991311", "B0009SUS4Q", "B00004R99N", "6303122647", "B00000ICHA", "1558906150", "B00005JKX3", "6304400225", "6303534422", "B00016JF2W", "B00003CX7L", "B00003CXQX", "6302484359", "6304400381", "B00005RDVV", "6304401736", "B000009CTR", "B00005T7H6", "6304501153", "B000035Z4W", "6305940932", "6303991408", "B00005JL95", "B00003CXHR", "078880720X", "6300276554", "6303939015", "B00004R99I", "B0000E32WB", "B00000JS61", "B00003CWPW", "B0000524CZ", "6304155972", "6304492960", "B000035Z46", "6304873441", "B00000G3AV", "6302794331", "B000063V8N", "B00004R996", "6303295614", "B00008Y47S", "B00005RRG3", "6304492952", "B00004REYY", "B00003CXQ6", "6304293968", "0788810448", "0788811002", "6304117752", "6305942285", "6303232221", "6303861733", "0788810634", "6304089449", "B00000J2JA", "B00005RDWC", "B00000ICHI", "6304089112"], "bought_together": ["0788806270", "6302642248"], "also_viewed": ["6302642248", "0788806270", "155890641X", "078881172X", "0788812408", "0788802194", "6303314015", "6302961572", "6302787068", "6304500831", "6302320402", "6302526574", "6304401132", "6303983812", "6302178924", "0788812807", "6300274268", "6304290888", "6304089767", "6305229449", "B000035Z2S", "6303929338", "6304100507", "6304400551", "0788805843", "B0000AQZYM", "6302158095", "6305319138", "6300275310", "B00004R99N", "6305326940", "B00005JKDQ", "0788805533", "B00003CX7L", "6304501153", "B0007KTBIU", "6305940932", "6303534422", "6304978286", "B00004R99I", "6303036813", "6301991311", "0788812440", "6302426200", "6300274608", "6304400225", "B00005RDVV", "6301390725", "B00016JF2W", "B00003CXQX", "B0002YLCOM", "6304401736", "B00003CXHR", "0788811002", "6304873441", "6302484359", "6304400381", "B00005JL95", "B00005JKX3"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 117443}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.93, "brand": "", "asin": "6300274195", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51V3HBK8ACL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dumbo [VHS]"}
{"description": "Tin Men, the second in Barry Levinson's ongoing film series about his native Baltimore in the 1950s and '60s, focuses on a pair of competing aluminum-siding salesman at a point when the industry was loaded with scam artists. Richard Dreyfuss and Danny DeVito play rivals who get involved in a fender-bender that quickly escalates from a minor argument into an all-out war, as they begin pulling practical jokes on each other. Dreyfuss takes it too far, however, when he sets out to seduce DeVito's unhappy wife (Barbara Hershey) and winds up falling in love with her. Much of the humor here comes from Levinson's keen ear as writer and director for the way these people talk--and what they talk about (like the discussion of why four men are living together without women on the Ponderosa inBonanza). Beside the leads, the cast includes a great host of character actors, including Jackie Gayle, Bruno Kirby, John Mahoney, and J.T. Walsh.

{"description": "This adaptation of the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel, scripted by Francis Ford Coppola, puts costume design and art direction above the intricacies of character. It's certainly a handsome try, and perhaps no movie could captureThe Great Gatsbyin its entirety. Robert Redford is an interesting casting choice as Gatsby, the millionaire isolated in his mansion, still dreaming of the woman he lost. And Sam Waterston is perfect as the narrator, Nick, who brings the dream girl Daisy Buchanan back to Gatsby. No, the problem seems to be that director Jack Clayton fell in love with the flapper dresses and the party scenes and the Jazz Age tunes, ending up with a Classics Illustrated version of a great book rather than a fresh, organic take on the text. While Redford grows more quietly intriguing in the film, Mia Farrow's pallid performance as Daisy leaves you wondering why Gatsby, or anyone else, should care so much about his grand passion. The effective supporting cast includes Bruce Dern as Daisy's husband, and Scott Wilson and Karen Black as the low-rent couple whose destinies cross the sun-drenched protagonists. (That's future star Patsy Kensit as Daisy's little daughter.) The film won two Oscars--not surprisingly, for costumes and musical score.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["0800125762", "6302816629", "6300182215", "6305718792", "6300215814", "B0001E7LQG", "6304925158", "6302415853", "6302281415", "6300216500", "6300262782", "6303052223", "0790744759", "0800124693", "0792839846", "6304039522", "0800106032", "6302936381", "6303823351", "630382336X", "0792110803"], "bought_together": ["0743273567"], "also_viewed": ["B00DHHWXYY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 232595}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.65, "brand": "", "asin": "6301247485", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XW0FSNT7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Great Gatsby [VHS]"}

{"description": "Assault on Precinct 13, the second feature by John Carpenter (Halloween,Vampires), has a group of cops and convicts joining forces as they're besieged in an all-but-abandoned police station by Street Thunder, a gang armed with automatic weapons and silencers.  The relationships of those holed up in the police station as they try to survive the onslaught form the better part of the movie, borrowing liberally from the films of Howard Hawks, especiallyRio Bravo, to make the point about who's \"good enough\" and who isn't.  The action is taut and shocking for its time (1976).  Street Thunder is more an irrational force, an embodiment  of pure evil, than a clearly motivated group with a political agenda, drawing comparisons withAssault's other main influence, the zombies in George&nbsp;A. Romero'sNight of the Living Dead.  More than an action-exploitation flick (though it more than holds its own on that level),Assault on Precinct 13is a disguised Western with a horror aspect that Carpenter would later work out more rigorously in such films asHalloweenandThe Thing. The DVD is a true Collector's Edition, preserving the film's original Panavision aspect ratio of 2.35:1, and including a fascinating commentary track by John Carpenter.--Jim Gay", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004Y87O", "B0000AOX0A", "B000AM6OQ2", "B0007W7I4W", "B00AEFYDM2", "B0002CHK1S", "B0024FADBA", "B00003CY6P", "B000QUCQX8", "B0000AOX0F", "6305258287", "078062856X", "B003YDORO0", "B00AEBBADG", "B0002KPHZG", "B0001611DI", "B000E8M0P6", "B00D7AM6M0", "0792843649", "0783228457", "B00319ECCY", "B008CYDD7I", "B002E01MHY", "B00AEFXW8I", "B00005JLJW", "B0002O7XW2", "B00008WJDA", "B001D5C1OO", "B004WMOSKA", "B0002IQLH6", "B004LB5F9U", "B000RPCK2O", "B00005N7Z1", "B000RIWAVW", "B0024FADD8", "B0036R92US", "B00005K3NV", "B00JQYV0B4", "B001J710Y8", "B0052DP1RC", "B0006GANN2", "0792838300", "B00097DY2A", "B003THSXJ6", "B0038SUBEG", "B0021L8UXA", "B00009OWI1", "B00EALTVPA", "B0002C9DK4", "B0001FGBUW", "B0067QPVJ6", "B00I9TDMRM", "B0007ZEOC8", "B000RPCJA2", "B000FFJZO2", "0783230427", "B0009298N4", "B00005KH30", "B000096I9X", "B000IMUYJM", "B0000AOX09", "B0015D20FE", "6304936532", "B003O7I6L6", "B001AGNMFI", "B000TUDBFC", "B003CNQPOC", "B000096I9V", "B00005NSXY", "B0055CP9TU", "B00005LC4Q", "B0013527K2", "B000V6LT6C", "B000GETUDI", "B000S0GYRU", "0792839684", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B005152C9G", "B0008ENHTY", "B00AEFXR8I", "B00AKGG828", "B000T28POC", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B00I099JO6", "B000OPOANO", "B000053VB8", "B00140PKCS", "B00023P4UQ", "B0013D8LAE", "B00005R2IS", "B00023P4SS", "B00C7A8WZQ", "B000063UR5", "B0053TWW36", "B001JV5BIA", "B001JFZ122", "B00I462XF2", "0783241895", "B00GOT11TA", "B000068IEV"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000AOX0F", "B0000AOX0A", "B00004Y87O", "B000AM6OQ2"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 535233}, "asin": "6301394070", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21RV2AX7HQL.jpg", "title": "Assault On Precinct 13 [DVD]"}

{"description": "Thanks to an extraordinary, delicately balanced performance by Peter Sellers,Being Therereceived mixed reviews during its theatrical release in 1979, but has since become a celebrated comedy with a loyal following. It's one of the most unusual black comedies ever made, simply because it stretches a simple premise over 130 minutes of straight-faced, strangely compelling commentary on politics, media, and celebrity in media-savvy America. Adapted by Jerzy Kozinsky from his own novel, the movie's about a simple-minded, middle-aged gardener who, after a lifetime of seclusion and safety in a Washington, D.C. townhouse, gets his first exposure to reality beyond the walls of his sheltered existence. His only reference to the world is through his childlike addiction to television, and when a chance encounter brings him into the inner fold of a dying billionaire (Melvyn Douglas), he suddenly finds himself the toast of Washington's political elite. His simple phrases about gardening are misinterpreted as anything from economic predictions to sage political advice, and under the sharp direction of Hal Ashby, Sellers has the audacity to take this comedic conceit to its logical extreme.Being Thereis not for all tastes--especially not for those who don't appreciate comedic subtlety. But as a showcase for the daring genius of Peter Sellers, this is a classic movie in a category all its own.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300216268", "6300181340"], "bought_together": ["6300216268"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 314447}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.89, "brand": "", "asin": "6301590740", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514HH6RMXYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Being There [VHS]"}

{"description": "Part mystery, part wartime polemic,Lifeboatfinds director Alfred Hitchcock tackling a cinematic challenge that foreshadows the self-imposed handicaps ofRopeandRear Window. As with those subsequent features, Hitchcock confines his action and characters to a single set, in this instance the lone surviving lifeboat from an Allied freighter sunk by a German U-boat in the North Atlantic. A less confident, ingenious filmmaker might have opened up John Steinbeck's dialogue-driven character study beyond the battered boat and its cargo of survivors, but Hitchcock instead revels in his predicament to exploit the enforced intimacy between his characters.Indeed, we never actually see the doomed freighter--the smoking ship's funnel beneath the credits simply sinks beneath the waves, and we're plunged into the escalating tensions between those who gradually find their way to the boat, a band of eight English and American passengers and crew, plus a German sailor (Walter Slezak) rescued from the U-boat, itself destroyed by the freighter's deck gun. Heading the cast and inevitably commanding their and our attention is the cello-voiced Tallulah Bankhead as Connie Porter, a cynical, sophisticated writer whose priorities seem to be hanging onto her mink and keeping her lipstick fresh. Gradually, the others find Porter and her lifeboat, forming a temporary community that inevitably suggests a careful cross section of archetypes, from wealthy industrialist (Henry Hull) to ship's boiler men (John Hodiak and William Bendix).Hitchcock juggles the interpersonal skirmishes between the boat's occupants with the mystery of their German prisoner, which itself becomes a meditation on the fine line between nationalism and morality, a line that Slezak walks delicately until his identity is resolved. Visually, Hitchcock transforms his back-lot set and its rear-projected cloudbanks into a desolate stretch of ocean, while capturing the horror of an amputation through an economical set of images culminating in an empty boot.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0045HCJ9E", "6302413435", "0783236352", "B002GSXKQA", "0790743159", "1558807780", "6301800974", "0783235623", "0769403468", "6301640667", "6301975987", "6301973232", "1558808590", "630150528X", "0800100832", "6301564456", "6302226899", "6301959728", "B000EVD38G", "B00004R67T", "6302909023", "B00005Q4GY", "6304457316", "0790743213", "6300246965", "6301798503", "6302360978", "0783221347", "6301797957", "6301973410", "6300183580", "6304196954", "6301798708", "B000056BRF", "6302842263", "6304359705", "0792108280", "079074886X"], "also_viewed": ["B001D8W7F4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 319371}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6301798732", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AC1NXHYzL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lifeboat (The Hitchcock Collection) [VHS]"}
{"description": "Nobody made a fuss aboutThe Comancheroswhen it came out, yet it has proved to be among the most enduringly entertaining of John Wayne's later Westerns. The Duke, just beginning to crease and thicken toward Rooster Cogburn proportions, plays a veteran Texas Ranger named Jake Cutter. When we first see him (in a tongue-in-cheek delayed entrance), he's catching up with a New Orleans dandy (Stuart Whitman) who killed a judge's son in a duel just after that gentlemanly practice was banned. Monsieur Paul Regret--or \"Mon-sooor,\" as Jake insists on calling him--is not a bad fellow, let alone a badman, and it only follows that, after the requisite number of misunderstandings, he and Jake will join forces to subdue rampaging Indians and the evil white men behind their uprising.The Comancheroswas the last credit for Michael Curtiz, who, ravaged by cancer, ceded much of the direction to Wayne (uncredited) and action specialist Cliff Lyons. With support from Wayne stalwarts James Edward Grant (coscreenplay) and William Clothier (camera), the first of many rousing Elmer Bernstein scores for a Wayne picture, and a big, flavorful cast including Lee Marvin (the once and future Liberty Valance), Nehemiah Persoff, Bruce Cabot, and Guinn \"Big Boy\" Williams (inhislast movie), they made a broad, cheerfully bloodthirsty adventure movie for red-meat-eating audiences of all ages.

{"description": "The second and last of Anthony Mann's historical epics is a smart, handsome spectacle of the decadence, corruption, and intrigue that tears apart the greatest empire the world has seen. The sprawling story spreads itself thin over a number of characters and stories. At the center are handsome but stiff Stephen Boyd as Livius, the loyal soldier and symbolic son of the aging emperor (Alec Guinness), and Christopher Plummer as Commodus, the corrupt heir to the throne--boyhood friends turned enemies when the latter accedes to the throne and sells out the values of his father for greed and hedonistic pleasures. The three-hour running time is filled out with the tales of Sophia Loren (as the beautiful Lucilla in love with Livius but coveted by greedy Commodus) and a gallery of heroes and villains that includes James Mason, Mel Ferrer, Anthony Quayle, John Ireland, Omar Sharif, and Eric Porter. The film is highlighted with spectacular scenes (a grandiose funeral fit for an emperor, brutal battles in the provinces as the barbarians threaten the empire, and a climactic duel to decide the destiny of Rome), which Mann weaves into the shadowy intrigue of the halls of power. Like his previous epicEl Cid,The Fall of the Roman Empireremains one of the best of the 1960s epics: well written (and largely historically accurate) with strong performances and a consistently elegant style, but it lacks a central core and the magnetic hero of its superior predecessor.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303282237", "6301976622", "6301628454", "B00004CIOV", "6300216012", "B00005QJJG", "B000056BRF", "B000059HH1", "6302354110", "6301412796", "6302413435", "6301972341", "6301798732", "0800100832", "B000A1KF8Q", "630266232X", "6301798759", "0792108280"], "bought_together": ["6303282237", "6301976622"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 398203}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.5, "brand": "", "asin": "6301959728", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GGGGPRHKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Fall of the Roman Empire (EP mode) [VHS]"}
{"description": "MGM released this Joan Crawford film in 1953, it was her return to the screen after a 10-year layoff and what a comeback it is. Crawford plays America's sweetheart, Jenny Stewart, to her fans she's a song-and-dance legend with sensational gams and a sparkling personality and a heart of gold. But to the Broadway insiders that really know Jenny, she is disagreeable, hard-hearted, mean-spirited, domineering star, who won't let anything or anyone sidetrack her career. Crawford plays this role to perfection and is chillingly convincing. This is one of the great forgotten movies, a musial-filled melodrama about a domineering star who finds love and learns humility in the arms of a blind pianist. A glossy production that only Hollywood could do in the 1940s/50s, highlighted by dazzling costumes and splashy production numbers with some really good tunes, this role fits the leading lady's bigger-than-life persona like fishnet hose. And Crawford proves her footwork hadn't slowed down since she broke into movies back in the 1920s as a Charleston dancers. Great supporting cast with Michael Wilding as the blind pianist, Gig Young as her agent, and Marjorie Rambeau, who was nominated for an Oscar as Joan's mother in the film.

{"description": "This documentary of the Rolling Stones' 1969 US tour has become a legendary, harrowing symbol of the tragic demise of the \"Peace and Love\" era. After a successful tour across the United States, the Rolling Stones gave a free December concert at Altamont Speedway in California with the Grateful Dead (not seen performing), Ike and Tina Turner, Jefferson Airplane, and the Flying Burrito Brothers (all seen performing one song each). The poorly planned show was fraught with problems from its inception. The band unwisely selected the Hells Angels motorcycle club to provide security, and after the pre-existing chaos was fueled by very visible alcohol and drug abuse, the bikers resorted to violence to keep the stoned, restless, and often naked crowd in line. The result: dozens of injuries and the on-screen stabbing of a young African-American man (during \"Sympathy for the Devil,\" no less) by one of the concert's \"staff security.\" In a manipulative but effective move, the Maysles brothers and Charlotte Zwerin filmed Mick Jagger in the editing room witnessing the on-camera murder for the first time. But aside from that unexpected drama, the film also works as a rock-and-roll document, capturing the band at their most relaxed, intoxicating, and electrifying.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001NXDSLQ", "6301095294"]}, "price": 27.98, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Classic Rock", "Album-Oriented Rock (AOR)"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Metal"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock", "Blues Rock"], ["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 311795}, "asin": "6302415993", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21S9HY0GRFL.jpg", "title": "The Rolling Stones - Gimme Shelter [VHS]"}
{"description": "Star Trek Vleft us nowhere to go but up, and with the return ofStar Trek IIdirector Nicholas Meyer,Star Trek VIrestored the movie series to its classic blend of space opera, intelligent plotting, and engaging interaction of stalwart heroes and menacing villains. Borrowing its subtitle (and several lines of dialogue) from Shakespeare, the movie finds Admiral Kirk (William Shatner) and his fellowEnterprisecrew members on a diplomatic mission to negotiate peace with the revered Klingon Chancellor Gorkon (David Warner). When the high-ranking Klingon and several officers are ruthlessly murdered, blame is placed on Kirk, whose subsequent investigation uncovers an assassination plot masterminded by the nefarious Klingon General Chang (Christopher Plummer) in an effort to disrupt a historic peace summit. As this political plot unfolds,Star Trek VItakes on a sharp-edged tone, with Kirk and Spock confronting their opposing views of diplomacy, and testing their bonds of loyalty when a Vulcan officer is revealed to be a traitor. With a dramatic depth befitting what was to be the final movie mission of the originalStar Trekcrew, this film took the veteran cast out in respectably high style. With the torch being passed to the crew ofStar Trek: The Next Generation, only Kirk, Scotty, and Chekov would return, however briefly, inStar Trek: Generations.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301543408", "630021463X", "6300213803", "6304415346", "6300216802", "6300214400", "6305587159", "6303909949", "B00008OSD3", "B000003K8T", "B000ECVAVW", "B000AA4FII", "6303944736", "B0001DI5W6", "6302424216", "6302510031", "B00005JLTM", "6304047843", "6302510023", "6302380294", "B0000068SI", "B0001VL30O", "B00000K2SC", "6301966988", "6305363668", "6302380596", "B00004TYS8", "0792839846", "B0002TT0NM", "B0000A36J1", "B000005QWI", "B00000JGEK", "630281622X"], "bought_together": ["6301543408", "6300213803"], "also_viewed": ["6301543408", "6300213803", "630021463X", "6300214400", "6300216802", "630273486X", "B00471JSRE", "6304415346", "B00BAXTYIA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 158198}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.99, "brand": "", "asin": "630242335X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XTS50JFQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek VI - The Undiscovered Country [VHS]"}

After befriending a lonely old woman (Jessica Tandy), Bates hears the story of a lifelong friendship between two other women (Mary Stuary Masterson and Mary-Louise Parker, seen in flashback) who once ran a cafe in town against many personal odds. The tale inspires Bates to take further command over her life, and there director Jon Avnet (Up Close and Personal), in his first feature, has fun with the film. Bates develops a real attitude toward her thickheaded spouse at home and some uppity girls in a parking lot, but dignity is generally the key to Avnet's approach with the story's crucial relationships.

The film does a marvelous job of portraying the challenges of cloistered life without being either off-putting or overly romantic.

{"description": "Night After Nightwas conceived as a serious dramatic vehicle for George Raft, a major star in gangster pictures (who had been a real New York gangster before coming to Hollywood). But the movie--for the most part an overheated melodrama--would probably have been forgotten long ago were it not for Mae West. Raft and West had been lovers when she was starring on Broadway. He brought her to Hollywood to give her a break in pictures with a small part in this one. But, as Raft said, West \"stole everything but the cameras.\"Raft is convincingly melancholic as Joe Anton, owner of \"the swellest speakeasy in New York\". He's sick of the racket, sick of the smell of booze, and sick of his girl, Iris (Wynne Gibson), a whiny, pathetic floozy. Lately his head has been turned by a classier species of dame, one Miss Healy (Constance Cummings), a society debutante who's been pining prettily in his speakeasy every night. Raft hires a high-falutin' tutor, Mrs. Jellyman (battle-axe Alison Skipworth), to improve his deportment and impress Miss Healy. He invites Mrs. Jellyman to dine with him and Miss Healy, when who should show up to wreck his plans but his old flame, Maudie Triplett (West). The movie shifts into high gear when she appears. It's fascinating to see West in a very different role than those she plays in her other films. No goddess with men falling at her feet is she, but an uninhibited good-time girl with a healthy taste for champagne.

Prohibited by Universal from copying their blocky makeup (and their script, for that matter), Hammer returned to Mary Shelley's novel for inspiration, and then went in its own direction. Peter Cushing plays Dr.&nbsp;Frankenstein as the rational scientist turned cold-blooded criminal in his campaign to discover the secret of life, committing murder to further his ends, or to remove an inconvenient mistress. Christopher Lee is the pitiable creature, a terrified behemoth more innocent newborn than malevolent monster. His pale, pallid, grotesquely scarred face was so thickly applied that he emotes almost exclusively with his eyes and his awkward, stumbling gestures. The not-so-good Dr.&nbsp;Frankenstein is the true monster, a ruthless scientist whose rejection of superstition extends to all moral considerations. Shot in blood-red color by Hammer stalwart Terence Fisher, the stylish, often salacious film became Hammer's biggest success to date, made horror stars out of the classically trained Cushing and Lee, and transformed the B studio into the Hammer we know and love today: the house that dripped blood.The Horror of Draculaimmediately followed, reuniting the winning team of Cushing and Lee, and Cushing returned in four of six Frankenstein sequels.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302491975", "6302814707", "6303637469", "6304361025", "630252542X", "6302843227", "6302843219", "630018529X", "6300183084"], "bought_together": ["6302814707"], "also_viewed": ["6303637469"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 413382}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 29.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6302814669", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AQX51CJ4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Curse of Frankenstein [VHS]"}

{"description": "Claude Rains may have meddled in things that Man must leave alone, but that doesn't mean Woman shouldn't get in on the act. Hence,The Invisible Woman, entry number two in Universal's series of '40s takes on the idea of making people too transparent for their own good. Kitty Carroll (Virginia Bruce) answers an ad in the paper to be an experimental subject for John Barrymore's dauntingly daffy Professor Gibbs, whose  invisibility serum, if successful, promises to replenish the dwindling fortune  of his benefactor, Dick Russell (John Howard)--if only he can get a human subject. Kitty's aim, however, is to wreak havoc on the draconian boss of her modeling job, the aptly named Mr. Growley (Charles Lane). Early on, she gazes hopefully into the distance, her face rhapsodized by a fog filter, as if to say: Oh, if only I were invisible! Then I could really kick some backside--which she does, literally. Complicating matters is gangster Blackie  Cole (Oskar Homolka), who schemes to steal the professor's formula because he yearns to visit his native land again, where he can't show his face. Bright and entertaining, swift and silly,The Invisible Womansports a first-class array of supporting roles. Quite visible are Charles Ruggles (Ruggles of  Red Gap),  hilarious as the much-put-upon butler, Margaret Hamilton (The Wizard of Oz), all too  opaque as the professor's housekeeper, and a brief appearance byCobra Womanherself, Maria Montez, as one of the cruelly subjugated models.--Jim Gay", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302841879", "6302526094", "630252587X", "6303129013", "6303129161", "6300185281", "6302526167", "6302526175", "6303129188", "6302843227", "6300185443", "6301257014", "6302841763", "6303103782", "B0047DKLCS"], "bought_together": ["630252587X"], "also_viewed": ["6302526175", "6300183092", "6302841879", "6300181278", "6303129188", "6302526140", "630312917X", "6300181286", "630018529X", "6302841763", "6300183629", "6300185281", "630252587X", "6302526191", "6303129145", "6303129013"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 318272}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 36.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6302843197", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MFF6DNH8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Invisible Woman [VHS]"}

In the troupe, a mime (Jean-Louis Barrault) falls in love with an actress in the company, but must vie for her affections with others, including a thief, an actor, and an influential count. When the actress is accused of theft, the mime exonerates her with a bravura performance for the prefect.  Eventually, though, the actress must flee Paris under protection of the count after being mixed up in a crime with the thief, leaving the smitten mime heartbroken. In the intervening years, both become involved with others, the actress with the count and the mime with the daughter of the theater owner, eventually having a child. Both couples are unhappy, and although the mime rises above the poverty-stricken neighborhood where he has honed his trade and becomes wildly successful, he still pines away for the love of his life. Eventually the two lovers are meant to meet again, but their storybook ending may yet elude them.

Unfortunately, the lady happens to be the target of her mobster ex-husband (Michael Parks), who has a tight grip on New York's garment district. Disfigured and finally murdered by her former spouse, Olivia is avenged in very creative ways by Paul, who resorts to such esoterica as using a remote-controlled soccer ball to deliver an explosive punishment. Bronson largely phones it in for this potboiler, though even in the winter of his life he can look quite compelling in his stoic way.

{"description": "In the mountainous high country above the Australian bush, wild horses  run free: Australians call them wild \"brumbies.\" Author Elyne Mitchell's book,The Silver Brumby, on which this movie is based, is about a magnificent silver stallion, Thowra. The story opens on a dark and stormy night in the high country. Elyne (Caroline Goodall), spins a tale to comfort her daughter, Indi (Ami Daemion). The beautiful mare, Bell-Bell, gives birth to Thowra, an exceptional cream-colored foal, with a mane and tail that gleam silver in the moonlight. We see Thowra grow up through several seasons. Winter has its hardships; the herds of horses find survival difficult in the snow-packed mountains. But summer may be even more dangerous, for that's when men return to the high country to try to catch the brumbies and cruelly break them of their wildness. For one man (called simply \"The Man\" in Elyne's story), capturing Thowra, now king of all the brumbies, becomes an obsession. The Man is played by Russell Crowe, whose usual fine acting is enhanced here by impressive horsemanship. The struggle between Thowra and The Man takes on mythic proportions, building to a haunting climax. Gorgeous footage of wild horses running and rearing in the mountains make this the perfect movie for horse-lovers of all ages.

Towards that end he tells young Roma Courtney (Lombard) that he is in communication with her dead brother, John (Lyman Williams). Bavian arranges a seance using his landlay, Madame Gourjan (Beryle Mercer) and uses a mask of John's face to convince Roma that her brother, reaching out from beyond the grave and tries to convince her that John was murdered by Robert Hammond (William Farnum), Roma's legal guardian. Of course, Roma is upset by this news and does not know what to do. Meanwhile, in another part of town, we meet Dr. Houston (H. B. Warner), a psychologist who believes that the spirits of dead criminals can enter the bodies of the living and continue to commit crimes. To prove his theory, the doctor has made arrangements with Ruth Rogen, the \"Greenwich Village love-murderess\" who is about to be executed for the murder of three of her lovers, to perform experiments on her body when she is dead.

{"description": "The movie that heralded the French New Wave movement, this lean and exciting 1959 film directed by Jean-Luc Godard (A Woman Is a Woman,Weekend) broke new ground not only in its unorthodox use of editing and hand-held photography, but in its unflinching and nonjudgmental portrayal of amoral youth. Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jean Seberg play two young lovers on the run from the law after Belmondo kills a cop and steals a car. Soon they are on an odyssey through the streets of Paris searching for some money he is owed so that he and his American girlfriend can escape to Italy. As a chase picture it features some startling photography on the streets of Paris, but as a romance it defies expectations, existing as part tragedy and partBonnie and Clydecrime movie.

The U.S. president (Henry Fonda) and various military and congressional leaders must then scramble to deal with the disaster.

The solemn, serious approach doesn't begin to touch the brilliance ofStrangelove's inspired take on the nuclear nightmare, butFail Safeis absorbing and well acted (a memorable role for Walter Matthau, for instance). The movie enters unexpected territory in its final minutes; conditioned for feel-good endings, viewers are still genuinely shocked by the plot turns in the final reels.

{"description": "If a film fan had never heard of director Mike Leigh, one might explain  him as a British Woody Allen. Not that Leigh's films are whimsical or neurotic; they are tough-love examinations of British life--funny, outlandish, and biting. His films share a real immediacy with Allen's work: they feel as if they are happening now. Leigh works with actors--real actors--on ideas and language. There is no script at the start (and sometimes not at the end).Secrets and Liesinvolves Hortense (Marianne Jean-Baptiste), an elegant black woman wanting to learn her birth mother's identity. She will find it's Cynthia (Brenda Blethyn), who is one of the saddest creatures we've seen in film. She's also one of the most real and, ultimately, one of the most lovable. Timothy Spall is Cynthia's brother, a giant man full of love who is being slowly defeated by his fastidious wife (Phyllis Logan).There is a great exuberance of life inSecrets & Lies, winner of the Palme D'Or and best actress (Blethyn) at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival--notZorba-type life but the little battles fought and won every day. Leigh's honest interpretation of daily life is usually found only on the stage.Secrets & Liesis more realistic than a stage production, however, especially when Leigh shows us uninterrupted scenes. Critic David Denby states that Leigh has \"made an Ingmar Bergman film without an instant of heaviness or pretension.\" If that sounds like your cup of tea, seeSecrets & Lies.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CXMY", "B0000DI87S", "B0058EA3MS", "B00000JL7T", "B0007ZEOPK", "B0008ENIAC", "B00007KK3X", "6304442459", "6302451930", "6300268063", "6302226899"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXMY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 233435}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6304393121", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VJYDY11EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Secrets &amp; Lies [VHS]"}

The result is explosive chaos, both in terms of bullets and visual sensibility, which some may find impossible to stick with for more than a few minutes.

At his engagement party, he finds out his long-believed-dead dad has only recently died, leaving him a large inheritance. Of course, Jack doesn't know how large until he meets a suspicious lawyer (Harve Presnel) who unloads Dad's prized possession: a four-ton circus elephant named Vera (Tai).Larger Than Lifeis a buddy-road movie. Murray uses his old tricks to bully or con several people into helping him, including a whacked-out truck driver (Matthew McConaughey). In this day and age of digital effects, Murray could be teaming up with Roger Rabbit or some other special effect; his interplay with Tai is quite natural. Director Howard Franklin codirected the underratedQuick Changewith Murray, and it's clear they work well together. A curio in Murray's career, this film is effective and fun family entertainment, filled with good-natured ribs, bubble-light dramatics, and a scene-stealing elephant.

{"description": "If you're a die-hard romantic with a soft spot for three-hanky weepers, this well-acted love story from 1993 will be just what the doctor ordered. It's about a waitress named Caroline (Marisa Tomei) who works the graveyard shift in a Minneapolis diner, where the silent, introverted Adam (Christian Slater) works as a dishwasher and janitor. Only Caroline manages to bring the solitary Adam out of his shell, and when he rescues her from an assault, their tentative friendship slowly blossoms into mutual trust and love. Adam has a weak heart and desperately needs a heart transplant, but a story told to him by orphanage nuns--that he was raised in the jungle with the powerful heart of a baboon--makes him feel invincible. This sets the stage for a tender and tragic love story that director Tony Bill handles as a delicate balance of blue-collar reality and misty-eyed fairy tale, and the quiet chemistry between Tomei and Slater makes it work. If you don't get a little choked up by the movie's heartfelt conclusion, you just might need a heart transplant yourself.--Jeff Shannon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 467631}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6304411480", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41QHNHHBTEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Untamed Heart [VHS]"}

{"description": "What would the average sensible American do if he encountered a pulsing ball of protoplasm from outer space? That's right: he'd poke it with a stick. Thus begins the endearingly earnest and silly tale of The Blob. Young Steve McQueen takes on his first leading role as, um, Steve, a spunky teenager with plenty of heart. Steve sees the blob kill the local doc, but darn it, none of the town's adults will believe him! Yup, it's up to the teens to save the day! Steve and his trusty girlfriend Jane break their curfews(!) and head off into the night to find the Blob and warn the town. The Blob is a completely enjoyable watch from start to finish, offering the triple pleasures of 1950s morals, gee-whiz acting, and a whole lotta extras running around and screaming. The special effects, though primitive, certainly get the job done, and it is still a treat to watch the Blob ooze its way to its next meal. You may notice that the theme song is surprisingly bouncy for a horror flick (\"Beware of the Blob! It creeps, and leaps, and glides and slides across the floor\").

{"description": "Using a faulty thriller for his soapbox as an outspoken critic of China, a devout follower of the Dalai Lama, and an influential supporter of Tibetan freedom, Richard Gere resorts to the equivalent of propagandistic drama to deliver a heavy-handed message. In other words,Red Cornerrelies on a dubious strategy to promote political awareness, but director Jon Avnet appeals to the viewer's outrage with such effective urgency that you're likely to forget you're being shamelessly manipulated. Gere plays a downtrodden TV executive who sells syndicated shows on the global market, and during a business trip to China he finds himself framed for the murder of the sexy daughter of a high Chinese official. Once trapped in a legal system in which his innocence will be all but impossible to prove, Gere must rely on a Chinese-appointed lawyer (played by Bai Ling) who first advises him to plead guilty but gradually grows convinced of foul play.  Barely attempting to hide its agenda,Red Cornereffectively sets the stage for abundant anti-Chinese sentiment, and to be sure, the movie gains powerful momentum with its tale of justice gone awry.

{"description": "Annette Bening twists like a mink on a leash through Stephen Frears's adaptation of Jim Thompson's novel. This may be the perfect trope for the moral hysteria that coils around a mother, her son, and his girlfriend in this slender but highly pleasurable neo-noir. Small in effect and local in scope, the film is about small-fry, attractive, bloodless con artists who view the world as neatly split between ropers and suckers, grifters and squares. \"Grifter's got an irresistible urge to beat a guy that's wise,\" an old-timer tells Roy (John Cusack). And yet the three characters here--played by Angelica Huston, Cusack, and Bening--only beat the innocent: Lilly (Huston) gigs at the track for a mobster named Bobo, putting wads of cash on long-shot horses to even out the odds. Roy, her son, swindles citizens by dimes and degrees, flashing twenties at bars then paying for his beer with tens. His girlfriend, Myra (Bening), is hustling herself, her salad days as a long-con roper behind her. Theirs is a world of gut punches and smart lines, and the adrenaline these cheats and chiselers live by is palpable onscreen. But a larger canvas? Maybe it's there as a parallel universe. \"What do you sell again?\" Myra asks Roy, the matchbook salesman. \"Self-confidence,\" he says, a wry allusion to the confidence game all three of them are playing. The movie boasts dazzling turns by Bening, Cusack, and especially Huston, whosem&egrave;re fatalebreaks new ground for noir.--Lyall Bush", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00009Y3PV", "1558908382", "B000QXDFRG", "B000DZ7YN8", "B001HVZOB6", "B00008K77D", "B0009GX1CE", "B00003CXGA", "B00006L91I", "B000H5TH20", "B00005O5AY", "B000QUU4MI", "B0015XHQVC", "B00005JKG9", "B00AEFXN9G", "B00BTYJYOY", "B00005Y6XA", "0780618564", "B00009OWJY", "B00008CMRK", "B00000JGHL", "B004ZNFTDQ", "B000HC2LHG", "B00005V9HH", "B00007AJF8", "0767830555", "6305973237", "B00BTYMPSQ", "B008XAT0TQ", "B00008EY9G", "B0013D8LBS", "6305504024", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B00005JPT0", "B0007G89FK", "B0006GAOJA", "B00441GZ00", "B00014NEZI", "B0043X1FNQ", "B000H5TH1Q", "B0006HBV3C", "B004SUDQ8G", "B00005U2KC", "0679732489", "B00097DY2A", "B001CW7ZT4", "B003O7I6SE", "B000P0I4O4", "0792838947", "B00005U5AG", "B00008RH3L", "6305308837", "B003U6SJY0", "B00441GYOM", "B00GHJ1YUI", "B001B1UO7G", "B00013RC66", "B000063JDE", "B007N31YH0", "B000M341QE", "B002VWNICC", "B0006GANN2", "B002AF4Y9G", "B0010YSD90", "B0000639ET", "B000069I02", "B00AEFXYJA", "B000P0J0D8", "B0006IIPLM", "0792833279", "B00LBY00Q8", "B000JBXXYK", "B0002O7XUO", "B008XAT0U0", "B00J5LXT44", "B000HWZ4D4", "B00005K3NU", "B00009W5CA", "B005FITIGO", "B000GRUMSM", "0792846109", "B003Y5H4R0", "B002LYD2MG", "B000E5N684", "B004U7MR14", "B00005K3NV", "6305999872", "B00008ZZ9E", "0792845803", "B00JVQ7PWU", "B00BTYU3SK", "B00AEFXBPM", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00AEFXG2U", "B000063US3", "B00008975Z", "079073219X", "B007UW9W5U", "0783229402"], "buy_after_viewing": ["1558908382", "B00003CXGA", "B001HVZOB6", "B00005JKFA"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 324700}, "asin": "6304981643", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515F06RTAPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Grifters"}

{"description": "After the tight plotting and quirky intensity ofFargo, this casually amusing follow-up from the prolifically inventive Coen (Ethan and Joel) brothers seems like a bit of a lark, and the result was a box-office disappointment. The good news is,The Big Lebowskiis every bit a Coen movie, and its lazy plot is part of its laidback charm. After all, how many movies can claim as their hero a pot-bellied, pot-smoking loser named Jeff \"The Dude\" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) who spends most of his time bowling and getting stoned? And where else could you find a hairnetted Latino bowler named Jesus (John Turturro) who sports dazzling purple footgear, or an erotic artist (Julianne Moore) whose creativity consists of covering her naked body in paint, flying through the air in a leather harness, and splatting herself against a giant canvas? Who else but the Coens would think of showing you a camera view from inside the holes of a bowling ball, or an elaborate Busby Berkely-styled musical dream sequence involving a Viking goddess and giant bowling pins? The plot--which finds Lebowski involved in a kidnapping scheme after he's mistaken for a rich guy with the same name--is almost beside the point. What counts here is a steady cascade of hilarious dialogue, great work from Coen regulars John Goodman and Steve Buscemi, and the kind of cinematic ingenuity that puts the Coens in a class all their own. Be sure to watch with snacks in hand, becauseThe Big Lebowskimight give you a giddy case of the munchies.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783228317", "0792845684", "B000056V73", "B000059HCI", "B0002G2B2W", "6305123616", "0792839846", "6304078145", "6302610702", "6304340648", "6301666569", "6302516986", "0790705141", "6303953425", "6300214753", "6305499365", "B00005ATQA", "630268644X", "6301578805", "6301627768", "6300184064", "0790734079", "6303454089", "6302941318", "6302054982", "1558807381"], "also_viewed": ["B0002G2B2W", "0783228317", "6304297912"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 212775}, "asin": "6304994540", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WB1EBQW6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Big Lebowski [VHS]"}

{"description": "Few films have defined a generation asThe Graduatedid.

{"description": "For director Robert Redford the trick was directing himself. The Oscar-winning director (Ordinary People,Quiz Show) says that he is one kind of actor (in the moment) and a different kind of director (more controlling). Whatever the problems, Redford has worked it out beautifully in this leisurely paced adaptation of Nicholas Evans's bestseller. When the prized horse ofNew Yorkmagazine editor's (Kristen Scott Thomas) daughter suffers a horrible accident, she tracks down Tom Booker (Redford), a Montana horse healer who is known for working magic. Soon East Coast brashness meets Old West simplicity as the reluctant Annie takes her even more reluctant daughter (Scarlett Johansson) to Marlboro country. Booker's influence goes beyond the horse through healing the heart of daughter and mother. The 2-hour and 44-minute film is a beautiful travelogue of scene and sky (with a giant assist from Oliver Stone's usual cinematographer, Robert Richardson). Never complicated, the movie's rewards may be hidden in its length and Redford's tendency to introduce us to a way of life instead of focusing on a story. The major deviation from the end of Evans's novel is a welcomed change.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790748193", "B0000DCGT1", "6305132666", "0767809262", "0792151712", "0767825616", "B000006N70", "6303153321", "6300214567", "6301586042", "B00004RGUU", "6302415853", "6305123616", "6304457324", "6302581907", "6302800420", "6300185095", "6302254132", "B00005NQGQ", "B00005PJ8I", "6300267970"], "bought_together": ["B0000DCGT1"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 113274}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.45, "brand": "", "asin": "6305126062", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41FQG9AC2GL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Horse Whisperer [VHS]"}
{"description": "If you were to argue that Mel Brooks'sYoung Frankensteinranks among the top-ten funniest movies of all time, nobody could reasonably dispute the claim. Spoofing classic horror in the way that Brooks's previous filmBlazing Saddlessent up classic Westerns, the movie is both a loving tribute and a raucous, irreverent parody of Universal's classic horror filmsFrankenstein(1931) andBride of Frankenstein(1935). Filming in glorious black and white, Brooks re-created theFrankensteinlaboratory using the same equipment from the originalFrankenstein(courtesy of designer Kenneth Strickfaden), and this loving attention to physical and stylistic detail creates a solid foundation for nonstop comedy. The story, of course, involves Frederick Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) and his effort to resume experiments in re-animation pioneered by his late father. (He's got some help, since dad left behind a book titledHow I Did It.) Assisting him is the hapless hunchback Igor (Marty Feldman) and the buxom but none-too-bright maiden Inga (Teri Garr), and when Frankenstein succeeds in creating his monster (Peter Boyle), the stage is set for an outrageous revision of the Frankenstein legend. With comedy highlights too numerous to mention, Brooks guides his brilliant cast (also including Cloris Leachman, Madeline Kahn, Kenneth Mars, and Gene Hackman in a classic cameo role) through scene after scene of inspired hilarity. Indeed,Young Frankensteinis a charmed film, nothing less than a comedy classic, representing the finest work from everyone involved. Not one joke has lost its payoff, and none of the countless gags have lost their zany appeal. From a career that includes some of the best comedies ever made, this is the film for which Mel Brooks will be most fondly remembered.

{"description": "A little drunk on its own arcane exotica as a gambling movie,Roundersis a film that takes us inside a world of high-stakes card players but falls short on such essentials as character development, relationships, that sort of thing. Still, it is a real curiosity, written by a couple of guys (David Levien and Brian Koppelman) who appear to know something about the dark underbelly of card hustling for fun and profit. Matt Damon stars as a reluctant law student who can't put aside his subterranean career of playing poker and blackjack for big money. After he loses his post-grad nest egg to a weird Russian kingpin (John Malkovich)--and also loses his disgusted girlfriend (Gretchen Mol) in the process--Damon's character turns to an unreliable old buddy (Edward Norton) for a dangerous game of sharking wherever there happens to be a game underway: frat boys, cops, bad dudes, you name it. Norton appears to be living out every young actor's fantasy of re-creating Robert De Niro's prototypical head case in Martin Scorsese'sMean Streets, and while his performance is burdened by obvious quotation marks, his estimable talent still shines through. Damon's charm and intelligence bring some oomph to the curiously flat proceedings, and while his hushed, soul-bearing scenes with Martin Landau (as a law professor who takes a shine to the kid) seem gratuitous, they're still nice to watch. Behind all this is director John Dahl (Red Rock West), who is not exactly at the top of his game here but who brings his distinctive toughness to the crime-noir tone.--Tom Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 343634}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.18, "brand": "", "asin": "6305240655", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51565J9D9ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rounders [VHS]"}

{"description": "Can we talk? Everybody is pretty well agreed that Great Britain's Ken Loach  is one of our most important filmmakers. On the basis of his work with  actors alone--often actors who are unknown until showcased in his films--he commands a place in the modern Pantheon. The problem is that hesoundsterminally \"worthy\"; his films invariably reflect a commitment to framing  harsh sociopolitical realities and steeping us in the fight for justice, a square deal, or a square meal. They sound, in short, as if they're \"good for  you\"--whereas the fact is that they're almost always damnedgood, period.My Name Is Joemakes for an excellent introduction to Loach country--partly  because it's just a tad more immediate in its basic viewer appeal. Joe  Kavanagh (Peter Mullan), out-of-work Glasgow housepainter, is a terrifically  attractive fellow, and though he's also a recovering alcoholic, he seems  eminently pulled-together and ready for yeoman service as a movie leading  man. The main story line concerns his encounter with and growing attraction  to a smart social worker (Louise Goodall). There's nothing star-crossed  about their potential love, but each is tough enough to set limits till  they've traveled over a distance of mutual ground. Meanwhile, Joe's status as role model among his more emotionally and economically precarious  neighbors--an extended family of man--is good for a surprising number of  lusty laughs and one fatal, criminal complication that could jeopardize his future.

{"description": "Despite the fact that Ilsa was killed at the conclusion of her  notorious debut film,Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS, she returns  (seemingly unaged) decades later as the strutting headmistress of a  sadistic charm school for a power-mad sheik's harem of sex slaves. She  masterminds a conspiracy to turn her trainees into veritable sex  bombs--they explode upon orgasm--and auctions them off to her master's  rivals. Meanwhile, a Henry Kissinger look-alike leads an investigation into the sheik's affairs with a couple of double agents, including one studly  guy who tames Ilsa with his insatiable sexual prowess. Campier than the  first film, it still offers its share of sick torture scenes and brutal  violence (one man takes a hammer and chisel to a woman's bridgework to  please her new master, who purrs, \"I do not like the scrape of teeth\").  Dyanne Thorne delivers an appropriately over-the-top performance, full of  eye-rolling glares and German-inflected growling. Russ Meyer regular Haji  and sex star Uschi Digard costar as harem slaves, and Tanya Boyd and  Marilyn Join are delightfully memorable as Ilsa's well-oiled kung-fu-kicking Nubian sidekicks.

{"description": "Pixar genius reigns in this funny romantic comedy, which stars a robot who says absolutely nothing for a full 25 minutes yet somehow completely transfixes and endears himself to the audience within the first few minutes of the film. As the last robot left on earth, Wall-E (voiced by Ben Burtt) is one small robot--with a big, big heart--who holds the future of earth and mankind squarely in the palm of his metal hand. He's outlasted all the \"Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class\" robots that were assigned some 700 years ago to clean up the environmental mess that man made of earth while man vacationed aboard the luxury spaceship Axiom. Wall-E has dutifully gone about his job compacting trash, the extreme solitude broken only by his pet cockroach, but he's developed some oddly human habits and ideas. When the Axiom sends its regularly scheduled robotic EVE probe (Elissa Knight) to earth, Wall-E is instantly smitten and proceeds to try to impress EVE with his collection of human memorabilia. EVE's directive compels her to bring Wall-E's newly collected plant sprout to the captain of the Axiom and Wall-E follows in hot pursuit. Suddenly, the human world is turned upside down and the Captain (Jeff Garlin) joins forces with Wall-E and a cast of other misfit robots to lead the now lethargic people back home to earth. Wall-E is a great family film with the most impressive aspect being the depth of emotion conveyed by a simple robot--a machine typically considered devoid of emotion, but made so absolutely touching by the magic of Pixar animation. Also well-worth admiring are the sweeping views from space, the creative yet disturbing vision of what strange luxuries a future space vacation might offer, and the innovative use of trash in a future cityscape. Underneath the slapstick comedy and touching love story is a poignant message about the folly of human greed and its potential effects on earth and the entire human race.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000VBJEEG", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00007LVCM", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B00AFEX83C", "0736424229", "B00005JN4W", "B00005JNQS", "B0042U94UQ", "B00E9ZATJO", "B001OMU6UM", "B00005JNS0", "B0030IIZ4M", "B0034JKZ86", "B002ZG97YM", "B002WJI2QQ", "B004HO6I4M", "B008YWY0HK", "B0012EM5D8", "B0006UEVT0", "B009SZCC9U", "B004G600A4", "B00AAXFYPI", "B00F522C7C", "B008Z1LBU4", "B00CTNYLQA", "B003H9M1Q2", "B000AAF1TU", "B008JFUQ16", "B000ROAK2W", "B000AY74OG", "B00275EHJG", "B00CWM58WY", "B00009M9BK", "B00EV1YZ96", "B001DPHDCY", "B000MV9026", "B001O5LVPI", "0783231474", "B00CQRN3QI", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00I6JOD2S", "B001HN6922", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B0087F7VSY", "B001U2MQE0", "B0030IIYYS", "B00A83075M", "B00H4Z07Q6", "B005LAIH4A", "B000DWMYQ8", "B00CHVJODE", "B0000AOX0O", "B003UESJF6", "B00JK531ES", "B00HLTD2OE", "B0001I561E", "B00BGYO7HG", "B003ZHVJGO", "B001ILFUD2", "B0002YLCOM", "B0039N74CW", "B00004U9WQ", "B00937R6QC", "B00CUDD0C0", "B004EPZ034", "B00004R99S", "B00003CXB4", "B000065V42", "B00005RDSQ", "B004ZBACOE", "B001GCUO7A", "B00AO686JC", "B000AAF1U4", "B0006JMLRK", "B00005JMQZ", "B0043X1FOK", "B00C7JGDBW", "B001JRB17Y", "B001KVZ6G6", "B00005TN8K", "B00005JMFH", "B00E9ZATKI", "B001ILFUDC", "B000V1Y44G", "B00003CX8Y", "B0011U52E2", "B00EBBGLFC", "B000YERP2S", "B00009YXAW", "B00003CXCQ", "B002NZK5SW", "B000G75AZC", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B0084IHVGG", "B00947N6D8", "B004LWZW7Y"], "bought_together": ["B001KVZ6FW", "B000VBJEEG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004HO6I4M", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00I6JOD2S", "B00005JN4W"]}, "price": 17.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 319062}, "asin": "7883706837", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51u-jDIxUZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)"}

{"description": "The Man with the Golden Gun:The British superspy with a license to kill takes on his dark underworld double, a classy assassin who kills with golden bullets at $1 million a hit. Roger Moore, in his second outing as James Bond, meets Christopher Lee's Scaramanga, one of the most magnetic villains in the entire series, in this entertaining but rather wan entry in the 007 sweepstakes. Bond's globetrotting search takes him to Hong Kong, Bangkok, and finally China, where Scaramanga turns his island retreat into a twisted theme park for a deadly game of wits between the gunmen, moderated by Scaramanga's diminutive man Friday Nick Nack (Fantasy Island's Herv Villechaize). Moore balances the overplayed humor of the film with a steely performance and Lee's charm and enthusiasm makes Scaramanga a cool, deadly, and thoroughly enchanting adversary. --Sean AxmakerGoldfinger:To ownGoldfinger(1964) on DVD is to have at your fingertips the proof that Sean Connery is the definitive James Bond. No one but Connery can believably seduce women so effortlessly, kill with almost as much ease, and then pull another bottle of Dom Perignon '53 out of the fridge.Goldfingercontains many of the most memorable scenes in the Bond series: gorgeous Shirley Eaton (as Jill Masterson) coated in gold paint by evil Auric Goldfinger and deposited in Bond's bed; silent Oddjob, flipping a razor-sharp derby like a Frisbee to sever heads; our hero spread-eagle on a table while a laser beam moves threateningly toward his crotch. Honor Blackman's Pussy Galore is the prototype for the series' rash of man-hating supermodels. And Desmond Llewelyn makes his first appearance as Q, giving Bond what is still his most impressive car, a snazzy little number that fires off smoke screens, punctures the tires of vehicles on the chase, and boasts a handy ejector seat. Go!  ldfinger's two climaxes, inside Fort Knox and aboard a private plane, have to be seen to be believed. --Raphael ShargelThe World Is Not Enough:Bond 5.0, Pierce Brosnan, undercuts his usually suave persona with a darker, more brutal edge largely absent since Sean Connery departed. Equally tantalizing are our initial glimpses of Bond's nemesis du jour, Renard (Robert Carlyle), and imminent love interest, Elektra King (Sophie Marceau), both atypically complex characters cast with seemingly shrewd choices, and directed by the capable Michael Apted. The story's focus on post-Soviet geopolitics likewise starts off on a savvy note, before being overtaken by increasingly Byzantine plot twists, hidden motives, and reversals of loyalty superheated by relentless (if intermittently perfunctory) action sequences.--Sam SutherlandDiamonds Are Forever:Sean Connery retired from the 007 franchise afterYou Only Live Twicebut was lured back for one last official appearance as James Bond inDiamonds Are Forever. He's in fine form--cool but ruthless--in a sharp precredits sequence hunting the unkillable Blofeld (a suavely menacing Charles Gray in this incarnation), but the MacGuffin of a story (involving diamond smuggling, a superlaser on a satellite, and Blofeld's latest plot to rule the world ) is full of the groaning tongue-in-cheek gags that Roger Moore would make his signature.Goldfingerdirector Guy Hamilton keeps the film zipping along gamely from one entertaining set piece to another, including a terrific car chase in a parking lot, a battle with a pair of bikini-clad killer gymnasts named Bambi and Thumper, and a deadly game with a bizarre pair of fey, sardonic killers who dispatch their victims with elaborate invention. Connery retired again after this one but he returned once more, forNev!  er Say Never Again15 years later. --Sean AxmakerThe Living Daylights:Timothy Dalton made his 007 debut in the lean, mean mode of Sean Connery, doing away with the pun-filled camp of Roger Moore's final outings. He establishes his persona right from the gritty pre-credits sequence, in which he hangs from a speeding truck as it barrels down narrow cobblestone streets, battles an assassin mano a mano, and lands in the arms of a bikinied babe. This James Bond is ruthless, tough, and romantic.The Living Daylights, set during the thaw of the cold war, begins with the defection of Russian KGB General Koskov (Jeroen Krabb) and his revelation of a Soviet plot to eliminate Britain's secret agent force. Assigned to eliminate Koskov's Soviet boss (John Rhys-Davies), Bond uncovers a conspiracy involving Koskov and an American arms dealer (Joe Don Baker). Maryam d'Abo makes a fine Bond girl as Koskov's beautiful cellist girlfriend, a classy innocent who soon loses her naive blush and shows her pluck. Veteran series director John Glen's action scenes have never been better--especially the show-stopping mid-air battle on the net of a speeding cargo plane--and he returns the series to the smart, rough, high-energy adventures that made the Bond reputation. --Sean AxmakerBeyondJames Bond Ultimate Collection - Vol. 1James Bond Ultimate Collection - Vol. 2James Bond Ultimate Edition - Vol. 3James Bond Ultimate Edition - Vol. 4Stills fromJames Bond Ultimate Collection - Vol. 1(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000BCPF", "B000ICM5V2", "B000ICM5VC", "B001PPLIEG", "B00AQSN7HE", "B0000BYRO7", "B00004WEJZ", "B007REV4T8", "B0000BYRO9", "B00005JL0I", "B000RPCK1U", "B00006BH8G", "B000RPCK1K", "B00004RG62", "B00003CXC5", "B000NIBUS0", "B000M53GM2", "B000NIBURG", "B000RPCK1A", "B000NDEXPC", "B000M53GLS", "B000M53GMW", "B001R10BN2", "B000M53GN6", "B00003CX5P", "B001CXYDO8", "B000RPCK24", "B001EDVNNU", "B000M53GNG", "B00003CXCT", "B002G1WPG8", "B009A87Z6U", "B00005JL8F", "B007REV4YI", "B000MGBLTQ", "B0002OXVDC", "6305181721", "B000CCW2UW", "B00006HBUJ", "B00I462XF2", "B00A2L1CKO", "B000V3JGI8", "B0000TG95Q", "B009RO9LKK", "B0024FAG1C", "B000BMY2LU", "B000C65YTE", "B000EQHXN2", "B00005JLXH", "B008YAPQX4", "B006MFQ4OS", "B005GT3X68", "B004BR7XLM", "B0024FAG1M", "B000062XF2", "B00005JL57", "B00005JKYX", "B00008K76U", "B002A5EBMQ", "B009A87ZQU", "B00008PC0Y", "B0058JEHTS", "B00005V4XV", "B007SPPANM", "B000EHSVS2", "B00005JKZY", "B000059H9A", "B000JF5TXO", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00003CXJ1", "B00004Y87L", "B000U7WV1Y", "B007K3JFUQ"], "bought_together": ["B00000BCPF", "B000ICM5VC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B006U1JD5G", "B00006BH8G", "B007REV4T8", "B000ICM5V2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 83723}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 46.95, "brand": "DVA", "asin": "B00000BLFI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510T6P93TNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "James Bond Ultimate Edition - Vol. 1 (The Man with the Golden Gun / Goldfinger / The World Is Not Enough / Diamonds Are Forever / The Living Daylights)"}

{"description": "So who exactly was Deep Throat, that all-important source who helped Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein bust open the Watergate scandal? Well, according to this thoroughly funny, keenly smart comedy from director Andrew Fleming (The Craft), it was two sweetly daft teenage girls named Betsy and Arlene. Taking the history and figures from Watergate and running gleefully and sacrilegiously amok,Dickoffers up a hilarious what-if scenario that takes the Nixon administration's downfall from grave tragedy to hilarious farce. When Betsy (Kirsten Dunst) and Arlene (Michelle Williams) run into a shady figure in the stairwell of Arlene's Watergate apartment building, little do they know they've stumbled upon G.&nbsp;Gordon Liddy (Harry Shearer) on the night of the Democratic National Headquarters break-in. Later, on a White House field trip, they wind up meeting with Nixon himself (Dan Hedaya), who, to ensure their silence, decides to make them official White House dog walkers and \"secret youth advisors.\" Of course, Betsy and Arlene soon find out their idol has feet of clay, and ultimately decide to aid \"radical muckraking journalists\" (and queasy rivals) Woodward (Will Ferrell) and Bernstein (Bruce McCullough) in their investigation. Fleming and cowriter Sheryl Longin's enfolding of the Watergate scandal is extremely clever and inspired, from Arlene's 18-and-a-half-minute declaration of love on Nixon's tape recorder to the Hello Dolly cookies (laced with a certain herbal stimulant) that help bring about the U.S.-Soviet accord. And after all the angsty-serious portraits of Watergate, it's bliss to see the prime players sent up mercilessly; in addition to Shearer, the cast boasts Dave Foley (Erlichman), Jim Breuer (John Dean), Saul Rubinek (Kissinger), and Ana Gasteyer (Rosemary Woods), all in fine form. Hedaya's Nixon, dead-on but never parodic, is an Oscar-worthy comic turn, and Dunst and Williams invest their characters with affection and humor; the success of the film lies in the way these talented actresses make us laughwithBetsy and Arlene, never at them. Don't be put off by the teen sheen on this comedy--it's also for all of us who still remember Watergate even after 25 years, and still love dancing on the scandal's grave.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303057942"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 509409}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.95, "brand": "", "asin": "B000021Y7C", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517TQG3CXVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dick [VHS]"}
{"description": "It's difficult to create a film that's fast paced, exciting, and aesthetically appealing without diluting its dialogue.Run Lola Run, directed and written by Tom Tykwer, is an enchanting balance of pace and narrative, creating a universal parable that leaps over cultural barriers. This is the story of young Lola (Franka Potente) and her boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu). In the space of 20&nbsp;minutes, they must come up with 100,000&nbsp;deutsche marks to pay back a seedy gangster, who will be less than forgiving when he finds out that Manni incompetently lost his cash to an opportunistic vagrant. Lola, confronted with one obstacle after another, rides an emotional roller coaster in her high-speed efforts to help the hapless Manni--attempting to extract the cash first from her double-dealing father (appropriately a bank manager), and then by any means necessary. From this point nothing goes right for either protagonist, but just when you think you've figured out the movie, the director introduces a series of brilliant existential twists that boggle the mind. Tykwer uses rapid camera movements and innovative pauses to explore the theme of cause and effect. Accompanied by a pulse-poundingsoundtrack, we follow Lola through every turn and every heartbreak as she and Manni rush forward on a collision course with fate. There were a variety of original and intelligent films released in 1999, but perhaps none were as witty and clever as this little gem--one of the best foreign films of the year.--Jeremy Storey", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 496767}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.74, "brand": "", "asin": "B000021Y74", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KYAD2YAVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Run Lola Run [VHS]"}

{"description": "As the triumphant start of a trilogy,The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ringleaves you begging for more. By necessity, Peter  Jackson's ambitious epic compresses J.R.R. Tolkien's classicThe Lord of the Rings,  but this robust adaptation maintains reverent allegiance to Tolkien's creation,  instantly qualifying as one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. At 178  minutes, it's long enough to establish the myriad inhabitants of Middle-earth,  the legendary Rings of Power, and the fellowship of hobbits, elves, dwarves, and  humans--led by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the brave hobbit Frodo  (Elijah Wood)--who must battle terrifying forces of evil on their perilous  journey to destroy the One Ring in the land of Mordor. Superbly paced, the film  is both epic and intimate, offering astonishing special effects and production  design while emphasizing the emotional intensity of Frodo's adventure. Ending on  a perfect note of heroic loyalty and rich anticipation, this wondrous fantasy  continues inThe Two Towers(2002).--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B005COPWZW", "B00005JM5E", "B002ZG980U", "B002PMV9FG", "B001GZ6QC4", "B007K3JFUQ", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JNJV", "B001OQCV6A", "B004M1A21K", "B008UZ7MYY", "B00HFFE8HE", "B000A9QKLO", "B000E8M0VA", "B000W7F5SS", "B0014C2FX8", "0618640150", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00003CX5P", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00005QZWI", "B0019L770A", "B000I0RQVI", "B002IPFWTE", "B001CDR1FG", "B0006UEVT0", "B003TT2X6S", "B001OQCV2E", "B009JBWOU0", "B00005JL78", "B00005JNOG", "B001UV4XHY", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B00GKOJ98E", "0345325818", "B0014Z4ON4", "B000H30B2C", "B005LXQLRW", "B001UV4XIS", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00CZDLGDU", "0345538374", "B004LWZW42", "B007REV4T8", "B000W746GK", "B00005JPH2", "B003TT2X72", "B004LWZWGA", "B0087ZG7J8", "B005G4TJUC", "B003ZK99NQ", "B00006HBUJ", "B008UZA8FY", "B0090SI56Y", "B000VI70QS", "B00005JNC2", "B004WCTLNY", "B0014Z4OMU", "6305313687", "B004AKCME8", "B000E6EK2Y", "0547928211", "B000LC55F2", "B0002KVUKM", "B000FQJAIW", "B008JFUO72", "B000FIMG68", "B005LAIHSG", "B005LAIIT4", "B004AOECXI", "B00029RTCG", "B000P0J0EM", "B002HWRYJE", "B0060FXDCG", "B001ECQ75A", "0792839749", "B00AEFXZJE", "B005LAII0I", "B0042U94UQ", "B001HN6918", "B00008G8M5", "B008JFURII", "B003ZKBELG", "B000P0J09W", "B003XURDAY", "B00335EQ0E", "B00008G8M4", "0547928203", "B000W796OM", "B00006ADD5", "B00J49R1BY", "B00B04NIZO", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00001ZWUS"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HFFE8HE", "B00005JKZY", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00005JKZV"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3641}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.49, "brand": "NEW Line Home Video", "asin": "B00003CWT6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Dj%2BQ1hLBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)"}

{"description": "LikeSaving Private Ryan,Enemy at the Gatesopens with a  pivotal event of World War II--the German invasion of  Stalingrad--re-created in epic scale, as ill-trained Russian soldiers  face German attack or punitive execution if they flee from the enemy's  advance. Director Jean-Jacques Annaud captures this madness with urgent  authenticity, creating a massive context for a more intimate battle  waged amid the city's ruins. Embellished from its basis in fact, the  story shifts to an intense cat-and-mouse game between a Russian shepherd  raised to iconic fame and a German marksman whose skill is unmatched in  its lethal precision. Vassily Zaitzev (Jude Law) has been sniping Nazis  one bullet at a time, while the German Major Konig (Ed Harris) has been  assigned to kill Vassily and spare Hitler from further embarrassment.There's love in war as Vassily connects with a woman soldier (Rachel  Weisz), but she is also loved by Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), the Soviet  officer who promotes his friend Vassily as Russia's much-needed hero.  This romantic rivalry lends marginal interest to the central plot, but  it's not enough to make this a classic war film. Instead it's a taut,  well-made suspense thriller isolated within an epic battle, and although  Annaud and cowriter Alain Godard (drawing from William Craig's book and  David L. Robbins's novelThe War of the Rats) fail to connect  the parallel plots with any lasting impact, the production is never less  than impressive. Highly conventional but handled with intelligence and  superior craftsmanship, this is warfare as strategic entertainment,  without compromising warfare as a manmade hell on Earth.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFXRRO", "B004U7MQWY", "B00AEBBA36", "B00001ZWUS", "B0007KIFGE", "B000065U1N", "B0015D20FE", "B001KZOUU0", "B00005PJ8T", "079284646X", "B001TUZG4K", "B00005JPKE", "B000095WW8", "B00003CXHJ", "B009XTF8NI", "0792839730", "B000M4RG42", "B00005JK8K", "B000P0J09C", "B00275EGWY", "B00003CXTG", "B003ASLJOU", "B003ELKNH2", "B000EHSVSC", "B004C45AZU", "B00AEFXKUI", "B00004XPPG", "0142000000", "B0007TKNGA", "B00HEPE6MM", "B00B0U2SFE", "B00005N5S3", "B00005PJ8S", "B00AEFYBA6", "B00006CXSS", "B00005ASGB", "B002ZG97RE", "B0007TKNLA", "0767802470", "B00IVLR9JA", "B00A34LX2M", "B00AEFY0F2", "0767817745", "B001LMAK9M", "B0000542CK", "B005LAIGYQ", "B000EHSVS2", "B00AEBB86U", "B00D3XMA9A", "B0000714C4", "B000XR9L50", "B000H1RFSM", "B005E2YL3Q", "B004TXFFI6", "6304698747", "0792838041", "B00008AOTR", "B000ELL1R6", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B000E5N63Y", "B000YBKO6U", "B00BY0EBK0", "6305558167", "B002O3Z50Q", "B00005PJ8K", "B006TTC5HC", "B0007TKNM4", "B00AEFY4IA", "6304765258", "B00AEBB86A", "B000DZIGDU", "B000FVQLRA", "B00AEFY5B6", "6305692688", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AMSLDTM", "B0000TANUI", "B00JA3RVG4", "B004SIP6QI", "B000O599YO", "B000MZHW40", "B00004XPPC", "0792838408", "B007HCI42A", "B0009RCPUC", "B00005B6JZ", "B0002YLCG0", "B00CZB9BE8", "B002O3Z510", "B00005OSJQ", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005QAQI", "B000CNESN0", "B00008AOTO", "B005DKS1TE", "B00DL48BM6", "0792841662", "B0001NBMH6", "B0001FGC1U", "6304711891"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFXRRO", "B00AEBBA36"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFXRRO", "B00AEBBA36", "B00HEPE6MM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22765}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.69, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B00003CXRA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510oEAHvU8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Enemy at the Gates"}

{"description": "Five comely and well-to-do female friends receive dire threats inside anonymous valentines. When two of them meet violent ends, the remaining trio suspect that the killer may be a nebbishy former classmate whom they spurned years before at a school dance. Their solution: Throw a lavish Valentine's Day party, all the better to distract them from the hulking, cherub-masked killer...As the above suggests,Valentineis the absolute nadir of the post-Screamslasher film. Australian director Jamie Blanks (whose previous effort was the equally dismalUrban Legend, 1998) obviously had lofty goals for his film, given his bald-faced homages to John Carpenter and Dario Argento. But he hasn't a clue as to how to generate suspense, and his frequent reliance on well-worn shock effects (hands dropping on shoulders, etc.) suggests more contempt for the genre than affection. No less than four writers (including two writer-producers forRoswell, which explains the appearance of series star Katherine Heigl) contributed to the screenplay, which fails to generate the twentysomething drama and hip, cutting dialogue required for this brand of horror. As the five friends, actresses Marley Shelton, Denise Richards, Jessica Capshaw, Jessica Caufield, and Heigl have little to do other than alternately look attractive or afraid; Richards, in particular, looks weary of playing the man-eater. As Shelton's dipsomaniac boyfriend, David Boreanaz (Angel) lumbers through each scene with an embarrassed scowl.Warner Bros.' DVD includes commentary by Blanks, as well as cast and crew interviews and a video for Orgy's contribution to the noisy, new-metal soundtrack.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["0767824954", "B00275EHDM", "B0020PFYHC", "B00003CXLD", "B0000541TL", "B000AM4P9K", "B00005JOWW", "6305300801", "B000A5045Q", "B0002VYOVS", "B00005J761", "B002ZG99IG", "B000MM0LIM", "B000TSIJWY", "B001AV3BWM", "B000BTIU4S", "B001JFZ122", "6305017115", "B0053TWVQE", "B000F6IOAM", "B0021L8UPS", "B004LWZW2O", "B0009MWELW", "B004P7CN7W", "B001NPD9LS", "B00441GYVK", "B001QMCJ0U", "B005CFBYW6", "B002FICQFM", "B004P7CNUY", "B0002IQLH6", "B00005JMDZ", "0792840127", "B000RGN2JI", "B00005UQ9W", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B0001GF2D8", "B00003CXWM", "B00AEJM61I", "B009IV2Z3M", "B00005RYKU", "B00008LUNW", "B00G5GNYY2", "B004SUDQ1I", "B001G9CNI6", "B0000ALPFL", "B00A2H9L2E", "B000069I05", "B001MFNB8U", "B002GHHHL0", "B00003CWRF", "B00JJOY45U", "078322933X", "B000MX7V3O", "B00GHH9IIA", "B000A6T1ZY", "B000FSME9W", "B00JWXDD6O", "B0002WT4OE", "B00275EHDW", "B00006FI0R", "B00BM4Q4H6", "B000FS2W3A", "B00AJLHUA8", "B000096I9V", "B005GT3X68", "B009IV2Z7S", "B001B8XRT6", "B00006LPHA", "B000WC389G", "B00008DDVY", "B00EU8RC1S", "B000067IXO", "B000ARFPMQ", "B00HW3EJ6Y", "B005ZHBEPI", "B000A6T20S", "B000IMUYJM", "B00AZTUUQK", "B000PMLJMQ", "B000NO3DLG", "B0001ZX0GK", "B008G4T7W4", "B003M05KU0", "B0053TWV46", "B002USF1WC", "B001GCUO4S", "B0052DP1RC", "B00HRUQ7WG", "B00013RC7K", "B0013LL2YS", "B000HT38EO", "B00023P4SS", "B00001PE4D", "B002G1WPI6", "B0054602MG", "B000CCBC9O", "B000UUX2Z0", "6305238065", "B000FA57US"], "bought_together": ["0767824954"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0767824954", "B001UE7D6O", "B00275EHDM", "B005CFBYW6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23437}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 34.99, "brand": "RICHARDS,DENISE", "asin": "B00003CXUP", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JFFE1942L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Valentine"}

{"description": "Robert De Niro plays a weary thief tempted by wily old associate Marlon Brando into, yes,one last job, a plan to rob a priceless scepter from Montreal's Customs House. Director Frank Oz's heist thriller partners De Niro with hotshot upstart Edward Norton, and you'd have to be determinedly grumpy not to get half a kick out of Brando, DeNiro, and Norton--more than holding his own--coolly bouncing off one another in a Method paradise. Brando may be enormous and breathing heavily with every move, but his technique is as agile as it ever was; he still seems spontaneously clever. Oz doesn't have the most crackling visual style in the world, as the film is far too smooth for tension, and keeps tapping Howard Shore's music score to do most of the work in that department; the divine Angela Bassett is once again totally wasted in a 10-minute throwaway role as De Niro's girlfriend.The Scoreisn't anything new, and there isn't a single surprise, but if you're into this sort of thing you do respond to its polished familiarity.--Steve Wiecking", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 801891}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Score", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005UQ9T", "B0047T74CM", "B00008K7AO", "B0015OKWL2", "6305263248", "B001MZ5W3M", "B000P0J0AG", "B0000B1OFL", "B002WNU0QW", "B00562D3Y2", "B00005JLX2", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B002O3Z4WK", "B000ENC5YW", "B000GFLKF8", "B001NY4WYC", "6305313687", "B001C5LLLY", "B00096S49Y", "B002DU39GW", "B00005LDDD", "B00005V9HH", "B000K7VHQ4", "B003L20IG0", "B00004XPPB", "B00AEFXT1S", "B005LAIGRS", "B00AEBB95K", "B000GDH9NM", "B0034G4OSG", "B0000DI87S", "B00005JLKN", "B00005JKBC", "B000C20VPA", "B000P0J09M", "0800141822", "B00008O38F", "0783240295", "B00AEBB9NM", "B0008KLVAU", "B000QUCRB4", "B000M341QE", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002VWNIEA", "B002AT8K9W", "B002CPMB9O", "B003ASLJIQ", "0767830555", "6305310335", "B00004ZDFL", "0783226888", "B00AEBB86A", "6305428115", "B000067IZ3", "B001N44BVQ", "B000NOIX48", "B001UV4XRY", "B000OYAT3U", "B00HOGBXS6", "B004EPYZP8", "B002ZG99N6", "B000286RP2", "B002NZK5VO", "6304711891", "B00011CZRE", "B000069HZP", "B0019EXZY4", "B000GRUMSM", "0767802519", "B000CNESTE", "B001BP4K22", "B002QEHPQU", "B00FRILRL6", "B00CX7TOOG", "B0051MKNV8", "B00015YVDG", "B004HO6HWA", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B00AEFXIIW", "B00AEFYF2K", "B000R4SMCW", "B00441GYZ6", "B0006HBZXS", "B000MXPE7O", "B00005BCKF", "B00008OE4W", "B004SIP7VM", "B0062P3392", "B00BB67UNW", "B0006GANOQ", "B00005JN0W", "B00AEFXEGS", "B000244GCW", "B002AT8KAG", "B003AWRMCE", "B004SIP8ZM", "B003A12WBQ", "B008JFUNKU", "B00KHA99BY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002O3Z4Y8", "6304711891", "B00562D3Y2", "B000GFLKF8"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21SM525DAZL.jpg", "asin": "B00003CY5H"}

{"description": "Bill Murray is in his early-career, shambling glory as Hunter S. Thompson, the gonzo journalist with a fondness for Wild Turkey and firearms. While Murray does not do as exact an impersonation of Thompson as Johnny Depp (inFear and Loathing in Las Vegas), he does capture Thompson's dazed, anarchic nature. Unfortunately, the movie around him is just anarchic:  a series of episodes (true or invented) from Dr. Thompson's career, circa 1968-72. The haphazard structure is probably meant to suggest the spirit of the counterculture or something, but it's just flabby storytelling. Thanks to Murray's blissful delivery, there are scenes that have a stoned giddiness to them:  Thompson and his attorney (Peter Boyle) terrifying an unsuspecting hitchhiker, or Thompson alone in a men's room with Richard Nixon. Neil Young contributes some music, and Murray warbles \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" while drunkenly piloting a plane.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001EDFSIQ", "0783229526", "B000S6M1Y4", "B006ISJQ1W", "B003W88QVC", "B003KWWDKA", "B000069HYF", "B00ALU48M0", "B006ISJQBM", "0743250451", "0684873168", "B00ALU46VI", "B002YOKVU4", "0345396359", "B0009PVZD2", "0345410084", "0679785892", "B0047496V4", "B0007UC8Y4", "0743240995", "6305428239", "B007P9HW3M", "0743250443", "0684873249", "0684873214", "B005IX3C4U", "B001TIQT70", "B0015R540S", "B0057ZAA6W", "B0008JIJ2O", "B004164T1U", "B002AF4Y9G", "0345377966", "B00005ATQB", "1439165963", "B00005JMJ4", "B003CRM6PA", "B0012L2JOG", "B0049M7BHA", "1451659717", "0679602984", "B0000648YY", "B000JMK6LW", "B0008KLVA0", "B0004Z33E6", "B008R65Y28", "0767821408", "0446313645", "B0000640VJ", "B0010X8NF0", "B000BX8R10", "B00004RJ73", "B008N2DP5Y", "B0006HBZE2", "0151003874", "B000GGSMC6", "B0000VLLHK", "B00441GYP6", "B00003CXWV", "0684873206", "B000N3SROU", "B007L6VR12", "B00007GZRW", "B000A7DVR2", "B000093FLA", "0783225903", "B008MIMWP8", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B000F6ZIII", "0767812123", "B00004REAG", "B00HLTYRUM", "B000NBK0I8", "B0009GX1CO", "B004SIP6LS", "B000Z8GZYW", "0767830555", "0007204485", "B0000WN0SC", "B004U7MQW4", "B00B4ZN3XQ", "B000EQ45CE", "B00HT2L7VS", "B0002I83Z4", "B0011E5M66", "B003626TNG", "B00005JOJE", "B000068MBS", "B000K7VHTQ", "6305468508", "B00441GZ1E", "6305594333", "B00003CWOL", "0316005282", "B00029RTAI", "B0006HBZEW", "B00JAQJNN0", "B0000VD04M"], "bought_together": ["0783229526"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0783229526", "B006ISJQ1W", "0679785892", "0743250451"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 253881}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 33.55, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003ETIT", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511M4F5MKBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Where the Buffalo Roam"}

{"description": "The first DVD released with the \"Infinifilm\" label,Thirteen Daysis the perfect vehicle for the extensive extras loaded on this single disc. If you enable the Infinifilm feature, a pop-up window will appear every few minutes during the film. Select one of the options and you're whisked away for a 30-second to three-minute feature on numerous topics relating to the onscreen action, including documentary footage of the actual events described in the film, cast and crew interviews, a making-of feature on the film, filmographies, deleted scenes, and historical biographies. (All the special features are also available in their entirety in the Special Features area of the disc.) Each segment is labeled with its length, and when the feature is done, you are automatically returned to the same point in the film. It's a nice way to take a second, more in-depth look at the movie. Historians, news broadcasters, and even Khrushchev's son lend their voices to one commentary track, which also includes historic speeches. The other commentary track includes key filmmakers and insights from producer-actor Kevin Costner.

Night Shyamalan talks at length about the film and his filmmaking technique in this exclusive one-hour feature. The approach is straightforward but at times is as self-congratulatory as a marketing puff piece.

Also included are storyboard comparisons and another glimpse of one of Shyamalan's early home movies.Signsis the first of the Vista Series to be a single disc and the extras seem light, but there are only a couple of quibbles: the director again does not provide a commentary track and there is no DTS soundtrack.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004BZIY", "B00064LJVE", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00003CXQA", "B000JLTR8Q", "B004SIP92O", "B00AEFYYH6", "B003102JDC", "B00005JNTI", "B00000G3PA", "B002GHHHKQ", "B003Y5H4SO", "B0002DB54A", "B00008G8M4", "B00AEBBA2W", "B0000648X0", "630471193X", "B002O3Z50G", "B00011CZRE", "B000PHVZNE", "B0087ZG7HK", "B002NZK5SM", "B00004XPPG", "B00005JOC9", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B0021L8UXA", "0783225733", "B0006L0LOS", "B0006SGYL0", "B000NOKFHQ", "B005LAIHXQ", "0800177029", "6305767866", "B00004TS0G", "6304711891", "B00AEFY3MC", "B002GIBVVG", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000U1ZV8K", "B00005JNY3", "B00070FX5U", "B00AEBB8NI", "B0002KVUKM", "B00008G8LY", "B000F6IOAM", "B00005JN0T", "B00AEBBA36", "B002LMV7R0", "B002NZK5UU", "B0013FDM7E", "B002O3Z4WK", "B0068FZ0GK", "B00015YVDG", "B000LC55F2", "B00001ZWUS", "B002GHHHL0", "B000BTJDGC", "B000EHRVOW", "B0087ZG7J8", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00005JN2Z", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEFXSLE", "B00019073K", "B00005LC4D", "B00005JL78", "B00IBKXSKA", "B004EPYZPS", "B00000JDIQ", "B00AEBB9WI", "B000RIWAVW", "0780618548", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00005JN0W", "B00AEFXNLY", "6305428115", "0767811100", "0800141601", "B00AEFXT1S", "0780631536", "B00000IQC4", "B004P7CNUY", "B001GCUO02", "B002AS464Q", "B00003CWS3", "B00006FDCD", "B000FS9FCG", "B00005JKZH", "B000067FP8", "B000K7VHQE", "B00BEIYG98", "B00005JNNT", "B000068NNU", "B000XT1P4S", "B0087ZG7PW", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B002I9Z8BM", "B00AEFXKUI", "B0010X73ZG", "B00003CXIP"], "bought_together": ["B00004BZIY", "B004SIP92O"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004BZIY", "B00386EZUY", "B000QUU4M8", "B0000VCZK2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 11300}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.99, "brand": "Touchstone Video", "asin": "B00005JL3T", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51c02AOAyCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Signs"}

Jimmy Tong (Jackie Chan) is a well-meaning but clumsy New York City cab driver who is tapped by Steena (Debi Mazar), associate to multi-millionaire Clark Devlin (Jason Isaacs), for a new job as Devlin's personal limo driver. After a mysterious accident lands Devlin in the hospital, Tong learns that his new boss has a secret - when he's not wheeling and dealing in high finance, Devlin is also a secret agent for the CSA, a top-level security agency. The secret to Devlin's success as a spy is his trademark tuxedo, a suit which is loaded with special gadgets which turns him into a high-tech fighting machine. After Tong dons the tuxedo and is transformed into a martial arts master, he takes over for Devlin and discovers that the agent's injuries didn't happen by accident. As Tong tries to chase down a handful of international super-villains bent on world conquest, he has to deal with Devlin's new partner, Del Blaine (Jennifer Love Hewitt), a CSA rookie who is just as baffled by her new assignment as Tong.

{"description": "She finally made it after all... to DVD! Created by James L. Brooks and Allan Burns,The Mary Tyler Moore Showis the very model of a tailor-made star vehicle. It transformed Moore from Dick Van Dyke's wacky housewife to empowered thirtysomething single woman determined to make it on her own. Moore was the anchor of a peerless ensemble who brought to life characters so indelible that three of them, Ed Asner's Lou Grant, Valerie Harper's Rhoda, and Cloris Leachman's Phyllis, would each get their own series. The 24 episodes that comprise the Emmy-winning first season (1970) hilariously set the stage for what would become one of television's most beloved sitcoms, ranked byTV Guidein 2002 as the 11th greatest of all time (it should have been higher!). The classic pilot episode is a master class of character-based comedy writing, as Mary meets her future \"family\" at the WJM newsroom, as well as upstairs neighbor Rhoda, with whom she would form perhaps TV's greatest female buddy team.Among the most memorable episodes are \"Support Your Local Mother,\" which won an Emmy for Outstanding Writing and introduced Nancy Walker as Rhoda's maddening mother, Ida. Another Emmy-winner is \"Toulouse-Lautrec Is One of My Favorite Artists,\" in which Mary dates a height-challenged author. Lending able support in this inaugural season is a stellar guest star roster of comic actors who, like Harper and Asner, apprenticed with Chicago's legendary improvisational Second City troupe: Shelley Berman (\"Divorce Isn't Everything\"); Bob Dishy (\"Second Story Story\"); Richard Schaal (\"Today I Am a Ma'am,\" \"The Snow Must Go On,\" in which he plays the ill-fated Chuckles the Clown,\" and \"Howard's Girl\"); and Paul Sand (\"1040 or Fight\"). At this point, the characters are pretty much one-note. Mary is cute and perky, Lou Grant hard-boiled, Rhoda brash, Phyllis flighty, and Ted Knight's vainglorious anchorman Ted Baxter idiotic. But what beautiful music they all would make in seasons to come.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00096S480", "B000BOH8YQ", "B000EXDS02", "B0011N19HI", "B003VTKZ84", "B002WN8IR0", "B000YKYT1M", "B000A9QKSM", "B001O4KBN2", "B000E6ES9Y", "B00009VRF0", "B000EQ5PTQ", "B0002NY8R6", "B002C8YSBU", "B000G6BL7O", "B003CNQPME", "B0000AUXVS", "B00144K5M4", "B002E58FT2", "B000MGBSH6", "B0006N2EZA", "B000E3L7EQ", "B0001IN0BC", "B0006Q93BU", "B0054602ZI", "B0000AZKKP", "B00GHH9HW2", "B000A0GOP0", "B00016XN48", "1451659229", "B00005JOEB", "B001O4KBNM", "B000291Q3O", "B0085Z6ZD8", "1451659202", "B0009B16TO", "B00008EY6N", "B00008EYBH", "B002E58FTW", "B000F8O2MO", "B00274SIVK", "B0007WFY4S", "B000MGTQ6G", "B008KZX7W0", "B002E58FTC", "B0002NY8PI", "B0002W4SX6", "B001DMVZJ4", "B002E58FUG", "B000291Q3Y", "B00HRUQB5O", "B002E58FTM", "B00HNGC56G", "B000QUEQ6I", "B00JPL3UTS", "B000AJJNJK", "B00023B1WQ", "B00DXLO086", "B000G6BLDI", "B000TD0PHG", "B0007KTBJO", "B00008NV4G", "B000FSMEB0", "B0011FLGYM", "B008VNI9TC", "B001E6JC26", "B000M343AI", "B00005JNS8", "B00D2UMHD8", "B002AL2TQK", "B000EXZFS0", "B000G0O5J6", "B000KGGIL4", "B0089BSLKS", "B000NTMA1U", "B0028S110A", "B000E3L7FK", "B00GOC74QG", "B000Z6GT18", "B000NJMJHA", "B0000V4906", "B0006N2EZK", "B00HZMZ286", "B0000BV1XX", "B000AL733G", "B002OOWKVM", "B002E58FU6", "B0014FAIYS", "B000UX6TL6", "B000E33VZ4", "B0050MB5AC", "B000ULM980", "B00DJYK1XU", "B00007KK5I", "B0030ATZH6", "B006363QHE", "B0007OCG74", "B00DXLO0D6", "B00005JO3P", "B001DMVZKI"], "bought_together": ["B00096S480", "B000BOH8YQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B006363QHE", "B00096S480", "B002WN8IR0", "B003VTKZ84"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15793}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 12.29, "brand": "MOORE,MARY TYLER", "asin": "B00005JLIC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41DTCVEJ7TL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Mary Tyler Moore Show - The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "It's not that the folks at Pixar are geniuses when it comes to DVDs... well, come to think of it, their fifth DVD set shows these folks are wizards. It's not just that the two discs are packed with watchable extras that hardly reiterate the same information; it's how they are handled--funny, inventive, with a light touch--unlike many PR-driven discs. A good place to start is the filmmakers' jolly commentary track, which branches off into 31 minutes of behind-the-scene stuff, deleted scenes, and curious anecdotes (they can also be watched separately). Pixar's first making-of documentary is a most concise and interesting 25-minute examination that also sheds light on how the company works. With a digital-to-digital transfer, the film looks great and is available in widescreen or reformatted to full screen. The \"Family Fun\" disc includes another Pixar made-for-the-DVD gem, the 7-minute \"Exploring the Reef\" with Jean-Michel Cousteau (Jacques's son) being upstaged by Dori and Marlin; it's a hoot and teaches a fact or two you will remember about reefs. Both discs feature lovely menus that can be turned into virtual aquariums for your TV (by removing the text) featuring the knockout colors of the film's settings. Watch long enough for some shenanigans from the film's characters and vocal talent. Genius, pure genius.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00EV1YZ96", "B00AFEX83C", "B00007LVCM", "B00005JNS0", "B0030IIZ4M", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B003ZHVJGO", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00003CXB4", "B001KVZ6FW", "B0013FSL3E", "B004HO6I4M", "B00005JN4W", "B000MV9026", "B004G600A4", "B000AY74OG", "B000VBJEEG", "B0006UEVT0", "B008YWY0HK", "B003H9M1Q2", "B00CQRN3QI", "B0001I561E", "B0042U94UQ", "B00E9ZATJO", "B000YERP2S", "B0006JMLRK", "B000AAF1TU", "B0000AOX0O", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00F522C7C", "B0039N74CW", "B00003CXCQ", "B001ILFUDC", "B00275EHJG", "B001HN6922", "0736429220", "B000B8QG4A", "B000RMJ4F8", "B0084IHVN4", "B002ZG97YM", "B001ECQ75A", "B004ZBACOE", "B0030IIYYS", "B0084IHVGG", "B00E9ZATKI", "B00AO686JC", "B000GUJZ00", "B00004R99S", "B0012EM5D8", "B0084IHVUC", "B0013ND30M", "B0034JKZ86", "B0000VV4W2", "B00003CX8Y", "B008JFUQ16", "B001DPHDCY", "B00005TN8K", "B00CUDD0C0", "B00A83075M", "B001O5LVPI", "B001NCDFTW", "B00G7TIKMI", "B0000E32WJ", "B00CWM58WY", "B001ILFUD2", "B00009YXAW", "B00CMY3JBO", "B00335EQ0E", "B005LAIISA", "0783231474", "B0002YLCOM", "B00E00OGE2", "B000H7JCK0", "B000UVKGPI", "B00005JMQZ", "B00JK531ES", "B00004U9WQ", "B005LAIH4A", "B005LAIHW2", "B00024I2Z4", "B00I6JOD2S", "B008NNY9QW", "B0000VCZKM", "B00FE8BVF6", "6302526574", "B004EPZ034", "B000L22SG6", "B001OMU6UM", "B00E56D8FO", "B0000524D0", "B002WJI2QQ", "B0009CTT6U", "B000050MN3", "B000B8QG3G", "B0058AFS0O", "B00006FDAI", "B00EGIAQ1K", "B000A7G4TY"], "bought_together": ["B00EV1YZ96", "B00G5G7EXY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00EV1YZ96", "B00AFEX83C", "B00I6JOD2S", "B004HO6I4M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7746}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 25.5, "brand": "Disney", "asin": "B00005JM02", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-difUGanL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "James Bond DVDs have in general been pretty loaded, butDie Another Dayraises the bar with a two-disc set featuring dynamic DTS 6.1 ES and Dolby Digital 5.1 EX sound that makes good use of the rear speakers. The first commentary track is by Pierce Brosnan and Rosamund Pike (who plays villain Miranda Frost). They weren't together at the time, so their comments are spliced into one track. Brosnan has a good time watching and is proud of the film but also doesn't take himself too seriously (\"They don't teach you this stuff at drama school: 'OK, now you're going to be electrocuted by the bad guy.'\"). Self-proclaimed \"Bond novice\" Pike also is proud of the film and says she's annoyed by people who question whether there's still a need for Bond. On the second commentary track, director Lee Tamahori and producer Michael G. Wilson chat about topics as diverse as casting, Bond lore, and product placements. For more Bond lore, don't overlook the trivia track, which offers pop-up tidbits about the filming and tips on the inside jokes.The centerpiece of the second disc is the 80-minute \"InsideDie Another Day\" documentary, which is a set of featurettes strung together.

{"description": "There's only one deleted scene in this two-disc DVD set, but it's a doozy. The \"Sgt. Candy Scene\" is a must-see and, unfortunately, the best thing on the second disc. The rushed HBO documentary shows us far more flash than substance. Better is the Visual Effects Lab that goes more in-depth with four sequences, although you need to wade through a hokey interface for each segment. Making your \"own\" effects isn't that much fun; you can only choose a few effects that change in two scenes. Anyone looking to get the complicated backstory of the trilogy figured out should dig into the \"Sky Net Database\" and an intricate timeline. The two commentary tracks are worth a listen, with director Jonathan Mostow's solo track the better one. The director goes into great detail on how the little things (from lighting street scenes to tricks for destroying buildings) count.  The second track is pieced together from the actors recorded separately. Mostow appears with actress Claire Danes (doing her first commentary track) and their chemistry is enjoyable after a slow start. The other actors have less interesting things to say, including Schwarzenegger who is constantly--yet enthusiastically--selling the film.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5", "B001FB55HQ", "B00005JA8B", "B00070FX5U", "B00007AJG4", "B002ZG98LO", "B000T9OP7G", "B002GHHHME", "B00005JKIP", "B002QFYJFY", "B0002J58HO", "B0000AXE8I", "B001AQO43M", "B00AKGG828", "B00026ZG10", "B0001BKAEY", "B00IZZDWKM", "B001451HXO", "B0000VCZK2", "B000056PMU", "B000BPL2FQ", "B000RW3VCK", "B0004Z33F0", "B000U1ZV8K", "B0045HCJGC", "B0004Z33EQ", "B00005JNTU", "B000HRMAPE", "B00008G8M4", "B000RRS7RE", "B00005JKYX", "B0000VD12I", "B000FC2FQA", "B00000ILDG", "B00000G3PA", "B00005JMZK", "B000MGBSE4", "B0087ZG7J8", "B0004Z33EG", "B000P0J0AQ", "B00005JMEW", "B0087ZG7NO", "B00003CXTA", "B0002CHK1S", "B000RJO56E", "B00177YA1K", "B00004STDN", "B005COLETU", "B001AK3S4Y", "B000VNMMR0", "B0000959N0", "B00005JMUA", "1558908846", "6305767866", "B001RIY4WE", "B0049IHX2C", "B000VI70QS", "B000EGDB10", "B002GSXKN8", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B0045HCJ9O", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00005JNJV", "B001451HX4", "B00I9TDMRM", "B0006GANOQ", "B00003CXSP", "6305428115", "B00016MSV2", "B00005JOC9", "B000TJBN80", "B009MO57H6", "B000O77SQS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B001OST0M6", "B005LAIHXQ", "B0002J4X1Q", "B0002V7OI8", "B0015XHP2C", "6304806434", "B000QXDED6", "B00005JL3K", "B008JFUPFI", "B003PIUINS", "0783225946", "0792839056", "B00005N7Z1", "B0006GAO6I", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00005JL78", "B001HN697M", "B00IJS2OXG", "B002NXSRVG", "B00008G8M5", "B00005JN0T", "B003XURDAY", "B000O77SRM", "B006VRRGNK", "B00F4FFO8E"], "bought_together": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5", "B001FB55HQ", "B002JT6AO0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 115564}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.47, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JM0B", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5143TFPX8SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Writer/director Neil LaBute (Possession, Your Friends & Neighbors) has created another boldly original movie that is as fascinating as it is unsettling. When nerdy Adam (Paul Rudd) meets Evelyn (Rachel Weisz), a sexy and confrontational art student, his predictable life seems to change overnight. But when Adam's brash best friend, Phil (Fred Weller), and his fiancee, Jenny (Gretchen Mol), meet Evelyn, the sparks begin to fly. Phil doesn't like the new Adam, while Jenny seems a little too interested in Adam's new look. Soon everyone is caught in a circle of passion, temptation and betrayal that is oddly funny and totally unexpected.", "related": {"also_bought": ["088145222X", "0767806786", "B00005NGAG", "B0000AMU7A", "B000GRUMSM", "B000NY0YKE", "B000A3XYIM", "B0001ME5GC", "B00109KN0M", "B00008G7UH", "B00005JMIJ", "B0000A9GHI", "B000EDWKX8", "B0000TG95G", "B0016MJ6HY", "B009GIGY3E", "B000092OME", "B0006FO8E8", "B0014GI6I2", "B00CX7OW1G", "B0015U0QVW", "B0002XNT1C", "B008K1PYIE", "B003EYVXXW", "B00006AUIH", "B00D3DJIG8", "B000LPS4L6", "057121150X", "B000I2J736", "B001RJ1Y62", "B00FRILRW0", "B00005QCVN", "1557830991", "B004SUDQ22", "B00005JMON", "B00003CXQ4", "B0023TCWE8", "B006DHATF0", "B00005ASOO", "B00005JL57", "B00AEFYC96", "B00CFHEFKM", "B004SUDQC2", "B00C7BZZ32", "B00000JGOI", "1559362413", "B0002JZT5A", "B003KGBISO", "B000I2JDEO", "B003O7I6SE", "B00AQSN67A", "0802145655", "B00005JNZU", "B002GHHHN8", "B0000ZMGWK", "B0002B15ZG", "6305801142", "B000CQLZ0Q", "0767835093", "B001E95ZNS", "B004499LX0", "B0081FSMQU", "B00007ELES", "B0000A2ZU3", "B00005JMWP", "B0028S10XS", "B00004Y87P", "B000MMMTBY", "0822223945", "6304698747", "B000286RNE", "B0016Q2D66", "B004UXUWEC", "B00005JKJA", "B0002KQNKE", "B00ARX2VZW", "B000S0GYRU", "B00DL46ZN8", "6305327068", "B000069HZP", "B00562D3Y2", "6305504024", "B00A3A3V0I", "B000EPFCPE", "B001GKJ2E8", "B009POCG0Y", "B00ADRYCWC"], "bought_together": ["088145222X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["088145222X", "0767806786", "B00008G7UH", "B00109KN0M"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 52011}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 18.99, "brand": "WEISZ,RACHEL", "asin": "B00005JMBQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZZZVT6BWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Shape of Things"}

The slickly (natch) produced making-of documentary goes through the standard routine; however, the less-flashy \"fly on the wall\" bits--just showing what happens on set without comment--is more fun, offering effortless insight on the filmmaking process. The best treasure is a nifty interactive history on pirates with plenty of background material. You can simply play the filmed segments or take a tour around a ship to discover the material (and a few surprises). There's a lot of archival material on the theme-park ride that inspired the film and several odds and ends including an enjoyable chronicle of the vintage ship's voyage from its home harbor to the movie set. The kids should really dig the DVD-ROM \"Moonlight Becomes Ye,\" in which they can turn their own mug into a ghostly pirate. There's also a bounty of extended and deleted scenes (19 in all) and a very funny blooper reel. With both DTS and Dolby 5.1, sound systems will get a workout with the excellent (and loud) sound design.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000I0RQVI", "B000U7WV1Y", "B005COPWZW", "B004A8ZWUQ", "B00005JN5E", "B0013BM63O", "B006VRRGNK", "B00005JKZV", "B00005JPH2", "B0014Z4OMU", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00003CWT6", "B004DTLK80", "B00005JKZY", "B0000A1RJI", "B004M1A21K", "B004DTLK7G", "B00003CXZ1", "B001HN694K", "B001E75QH0", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00005JKCH", "B0087ZG7HK", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B000E6EK2Y", "B000E8M0VA", "B003UYUQZW", "B00AEFYGBA", "B000W746GK", "B00005JMQW", "B0083SBMBM", "B001DHXT20", "B0002234LS", "B000W7F5SS", "B002PMV9FG", "B0002KVUKM", "B004EPYZUS", "B0053FANRC", "B00BEZTMFY", "6304806434", "B000VR0570", "0783231644", "B001OQCV6A", "B000AYELVA", "B008JFUO72", "B005G4TJUC", "B00004R99S", "B00023B1LC", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00003CXI1", "B001HQZJMU", "B00000IRE6", "B0002ZDVEU", "B008QE9XD2", "B00F84H73Q", "B00E5I2MEK", "B003Y5H5EW", "B007K3JFUQ", "B003QO8TOQ", "B000NQRR1Q", "B000YPUF9W", "B001EZE5BU", "B004A8ZWSS", "B0009MDPYM", "B00LG6YEKE", "B002ZG980U", "B002ZG994U", "B000U1ZV8K", "B001DZ8TRW", "B00005JLR2", "B000VWYJ86", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00000JQB5", "B004XKCZAG", "B000W796OM", "B001GCUO0W", "B00AQSN7HE", "B00000ILDH", "B0053FANT0", "B0000VAFO0", "B0002IQMAM", "B000HRMAPE", "B004LWZW7Y", "B008UZA8FY", "B0001HLVS2", "B00007AJGH", "B00005JNJV", "B003YAR97K", "B00CHVJODE", "B000UR9T8C", "B0049IHX2C", "B000G6BLW4", "B00177YA1K", "0783227345", "B0014Z4ON4", "B001TK80C0", "B002O5M4T4", "B00AEBBA72", "B00005JOC9"], "bought_together": ["B000I0RQVI", "B000U7WV1Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005COPWZW", "B000I0RQVI", "B0071JADFU", "B00005JPFX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6260}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.23, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JM5E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51fX40gGdXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}

{"description": "Based on the perennial nonfiction bestseller by H.G. Bissinger,Friday Night Lightslooks at high school football in the harsh light of reality, finding heart and hardness while stirring our emotions. Actor-director Peter Berg (Very Bad Things, The Rundown) is Bissinger's cousin; he knows the material well, and understands how an obsession with winning turns high school kids into somber, over-pressured gladiators--expendable soldiers in a community war against shame and obscurity. The fact-based story focuses on the 1988 football season of Odessa-Permian high school in West Texas, and as a fast-paced sports movie, Berg delivers the goods with a rousing, frenetically styled crowd-pleaser. But there's darkness in this tale of weary underdogs, including an abusive father (well-played by country music star Tim McGraw), threatening townsfolk, an injured star running back (Derek Luke), a tormented quarterback (Lucas Black), and the melancholy coach (Billy Bob Thornton) who takes his team to the finals. Berg's film could use less flashy cutting and more drama to support its gridiron intensity, butFriday Night Lightsoffers a refreshing alternative to the conventional sports movie, and makes a perfect triple-feature with the equally exciting documentariesGo Tigers!andThe Last Game.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JPBO", "B00AEBB9UU", "B000056VP4", "B005CA4SOM", "B002NZK5QO", "B000J3OTT6", "B000EXZFCQ", "B00004W221", "6305428492", "B000KHYN9C", "0306809907", "B00AEFXOKO", "B002VECM6S", "B0001US66Y", "B001LGXIA6", "B00E1HIXFW", "B0032UYFAQ", "B004BFTFBU", "B003L77GCE", "0792843592", "B001RXDM2C", "B00B83N2NU", "B0014DO5XU", "B000RF1QE2", "B002O3Z4XY", "B000068NNU", "B00AEFYJI0", "B009YQJ2Q4", "B000A0GP0Y", "B000649YAM", "B00008EY60", "B000MNOX94", "1935618563", "B000FVR1T2", "B000GAKDAG", "B00AEFXJY0", "B009NNM9OA", "B001FB55NK", "B000ARTN3I", "630529142X", "B00002SSKG", "B00AEBB9AA", "630514415X", "0201196778", "B0060ZJ7BC", "B00553K9IA", "B00000G3PA", "B00004Z4WR", "6305313687", "B003UESJHO", "B00AEFYKWU", "0800141741", "B00028HBES", "B0002S94CK", "B0000AC8LH", "B00004RE45", "B000TZJBPQ", "B00009OWJV", "B000274T94", "B00005JLRZ", "B001G5T6GW", "B00AEBBA36", "B00004Y2R1", "B000035Z59", "B0068FZ0GK", "B000Y7WGOW", "B004KPLVX6", "B004GJYROG", "B00004TJQJ", "B003UESJ9M", "B000M4RG42", "B00AEBB86A", "B005OZVXCU", "B006X08ET0", "B00005JM10", "B00005JLG1", "B002GIBVVQ", "B00003CXTG", "B002ZG99N6", "B001FB55L2", "B00AEBBA2M", "0800177258", "B00003CXNY", "6304765258", "B000VG66XS", "B002YMWQ2M", "B000WZEZGI", "B0002J4YVK", "B0007LLPXI", "B004GJYRF0", "B000F4RH84", "B000F6ZIIS", "B000068QPY", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B002T4GWWA", "B0034G4P94", "B000NO39FG", "B000ADWDE8", "B00003GPFT", "B0000633U2"], "bought_together": ["B000056VP4", "B00005JPBO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004GXKBF6", "0306809907", "B000056VP4", "B005CA4SOM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7523}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.89, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JNEW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X7RX6KY3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Friday Night Lights (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "There's a pretty good gimmick with these DVD extras aimed squarely at the pre-teen/early teen audience that ate up this film. Each of the extras (a standard making-of featurette, an alternate ending, and an interesting deleted scene) is followed by a clue afterwards. Decipher the clues and unlock the next set of extras: a nice bit on real treasure hunters, an awful piece on the Knights Templar, and one gem for kids: \"Riley Poole's Decode this!\" Actor Justin Bartha reprises his role (Nic Cage's techno-sidekick) and lectures a bit on the cooler side of language history and code-breaking with a few simple interactive games. If you get through it all, you unlock a hidden feature, a trivia track. Thankfully, those who do not want to go on the treasure hunt can access these features by reading the printed insert. Also thankfully, director Jon Turteltaub's enthusiasm always makes DVD extras more watchable than most.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0013BM63O", "B002GJTYIW", "B000NOKJC2", "B00979KQFO", "B00005JOC9", "B002O5M4T4", "B002ZG99KO", "B00005JM5E", "B00004Z4WR", "B001DTPZNY", "B005COPWZW", "B00008G8M4", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B000I0RQVI", "B001E75QH0", "B00AEFZ2DG", "B000OVLBF8", "B00003CXC5", "B0009NSCRQ", "B000ASATYY", "076780676X", "B00AEFYGBA", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00000G3PA", "B0067EKYAY", "0767810856", "B002O3Z50G", "B000YGGNMO", "B0012KJ0DK", "B000AYELVA", "B000JLTRIQ", "B000E8M0VA", "B001OQCV6A", "B000A0GP0Y", "B0009DWL8W", "B000VWYJ86", "B000IJ7A24", "B005LAII1W", "B001L57ZYM", "B0002ZDVEU", "B001TODCII", "B0049GYXH2", "B00000JQB5", "6305433909", "B000UNYK4E", "B0016Q2D5M", "B00177Y9ZC", "B001GCUO02", "B00003CXZ1", "B00014NEZI", "B007K3JFUQ", "B00003CXA6", "B0034GK78W", "B00344EAN2", "B001MVYUQG", "B000FO0AA6", "B004M1A21K", "B00003CXC3", "B0012QCZ54", "B00E8G5HQE", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00009XUM5", "B001DHXT20", "B00005JMXX", "B000J3OTT6", "B001FB55MG", "B000031EGV", "B001HQZJMU", "B0014Z4OMU", "B004SIP8JI", "B005LAIIPS", "B001F7MSFM", "B00005JMOW", "B001GZ6QC4", "B003Q6D2B4", "B00003CXMP", "B005F2JRUC", "B00AEFXSLE", "B004EPYZUS", "B000J3OTSM", "6305213283", "B00028HBES", "B000FO0A9W", "B008JFUNTG", "B0007KIFGE", "B002GSXKP6", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00008G8LM", "B00005JN3W", "B00AEFXXMI", "B0087ZG7NO", "B002ZG99TK", "B00AEFYXJ0"], "bought_together": ["B0013BM63O", "B002ZG99KO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0013BM63O", "B000NOKJC2", "B00BQRY4C6", "B002GJTYIW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 1940}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.75, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JN5E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51S18NKZHRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "National Treasure (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "The supplemental features ofFahrenheit 9/11offer almost an hour and a half of further manna for Michael Moore's supporters and ammunition for his critics, including appearances by two of the most memorable figures in the film, Michigan mother Lila Lipscomb and Marine corporal Abdul Henderson.  \"The Release ofFahrenheit 9/11\" (11 minutes) collects reactions to the film from celebrities, political leaders, and Quentin Tarantino and Tilda Swinton of the 2004 Cannes Film Festival jury (but no film critics).  Lipscomb gives a moving speech at the film's Washington, D.C. premiere (4 minutes), and in an 18-minute sequence, an embedded Swedish journalist recounts his experiences, accompanied by footage of U.S. soldiers raiding an Iraqi home.  This provides the context for the scene in the main film in which a soldier gets his picture taken with a bound and hooded Iraqi, which is chillingly similar to the infamous pictures from Abu Ghraib prison.  The second part of the DVD features consists of seven new or extended scenes (about 50 minutes total), including more footage of Iraq before the invasion; protesters outside Abu Ghraib and former prisoners showing their injuries; more thoughts from Cpl. Abdul Henderson; National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice trying to squirm off the hook in front of the 9/11 Commission; and President Bush going through the motions of a press appearance after he appeared before the same commission.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000UNYJXQ", "B0030Y11XS", "B00008DDVV", "B00009YXAS", "B00008K76O", "B0030Y11O2", "B0002RQ2Q2", "B001G43C1S", "B00008L3TE", "B0041KKYBA", "B00068VAOG", "B000T28C5Y", "B000ICL3KG", "B000BTH4K4", "B002FOQY7M", "B0002OXVBO", "B001NMT8R0", "B001MFNB5I", "B001MVWFAO", "0743272927", "B000FBH3W2", "B0007DBJM8", "B000UYX4N6", "B0027BOL4G", "B000U6YJMO", "B00G0PXU2Y", "B00005JPXA", "B000GYHRHO", "B002EP8TQG", "B000C3L2IO", "B000JVSUSE", "B004EPYZDA", "B0016N52IK", "B001BEK8FQ", "B0041KKYBK", "B00KY6YAO2", "B00F12IRSO", "B00DYC648S", "B001F5274G", "B0001L3LUE", "B000HWXOT0", "B005FITIGO", "B003CJXJ8Q", "B0013D8LHM", "B00DPUB5LK", "044653224X", "B005KBJC0I", "B004FQX59I", "B00KUS5YGC", "B007KAUWO2", "B00GYG8BKK", "B000093NQZ", "B001P9G3HE", "B00483VQTE", "B003Q6D28C", "B001B7CNW4", "B000BBOUHM", "B00744WZ8U", "B00066VTBW", "B001KWB0L0", "B00443YDWK", "B000059TG8", "B000JLTRIQ", "B003JUINFM", "0060392452", "B000I5Y8FU", "B000BITURA", "B003XKNGLY", "B004EPYZDK", "B003M987AG", "B000PY52IG", "B006ML50QK", "B000QGE89W", "B00EK52XQK", "B00DENQEE6", "B000GH3CR0", "B0047UJBP4", "B00005J75F", "0446693790", "B0006N2DSI", "B001AEF6HM", "B00005JLYW", "B001J66JQI", "B000O0YV7O", "B002NPCJRC", "B00AZMFG48", "B0042KZJIC", "B00827OX5Q", "B0002HDXTQ", "B001E5FYS8", "B00AEBB89C", "B003H23KSM", "B000CEXEWA", "0615602223", "B006JN86VW", "B00914YLAG", "B0001IXT36", "B008PUI1GM", "B004SIP7ZS"], "bought_together": ["B000UNYJXQ", "B0030Y11XS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000UNYJXQ", "B0030Y11XS", "B00008DDVV", "B0002OXVBO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 44430}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.0, "brand": "From HIBISCUS EXPRESS, http://www.amazon.com/shops/AXD9LOVGJXES3", "asin": "B00005JNEI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KDRVF1JGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fahrenheit 9/11"}

{"description": "Batman Beginsdiscards the previous four films in the series and recasts the Caped Crusader as a fearsome avenging angel. That's good news, because the series, which had gotten off to a rousing start under Tim Burton, had gradually dissolved into self-parody by 1997'sBatman & Robin. As the title implies,Batman Beginstells the story anew, when Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) flees Western civilization following the murder of his parents. He is taken in by a mysterious instructor named Ducard (Liam Neeson in another mentor role) and urged to become a ninja in the League of Shadows, but he instead returns to his native Gotham City resolved to end the mob rule that is strangling it. But are there forces even more sinister at hand?Cowritten by the team of David S. Goyer (a veteran comic book writer) and director Christopher Nolan (Memento),Batman Beginsis a welcome return to the grim and gritty version of the Dark Knight, owing a great debt to the graphic novels that preceded it. It doesn't have the razzle dazzle, or the mass appeal, ofSpider-Man 2(though the Batmobile is cool), and retelling the origin means it starts slowly, like most \"first\" superhero movies. But it's certainly the best Bat-film since Burton's original, and one of the best superhero movies of its time. Bale cuts a good figure as Batman, intense and dangerous but with some of the lightheartedness Michael Keaton brought to the character. Michael Caine provides much of the film's humor as the family butler, Alfred, and as the love interest, Katie Holmes (Dawson's Creek) is surprisingly believable in her first adult role. Also featuring Gary Oldman as the young police officer Jim Gordon, Morgan Freeman as a Q-like gadgets expert, and Cillian Murphy as the vile Jonathan Crane.--David HoriuchiBatmanat Amazon.comAllBatmanDVDsBatman Begins101: A Comic Book PrimerWhere Have I Seen Christian Bale?AllBatmanComics and Graphic NovelsBatmanToysBatman BeginsSoundtrackStills fromBatman Begins(click for larger images)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA", "B002GSXKN8", "B000P0J06U", "B001OST0LW", "B000P0J06K", "B004EPZ07K", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00005JKCH", "B001GCUO1Q", "B002ZG980U", "B001OST0M6", "B008JFUPFI", "B004LWZWFQ", "B00005JMQW", "B004LWZW42", "B000VI70QS", "B001DHXT20", "B000M341QE", "B0000959N0", "B000UR9T8C", "B00005JNTU", "B000AYELVA", "B00E5I2M6I", "B002IPFWTE", "B000HEVZ9E", "B0090SI56Y", "B002HWRYJE", "B0006L0LOS", "B000OVLBF8", "B00003CWT6", "B000VR0570", "B00E5I2MEK", "B000HCO83Q", "B0007P0Y7C", "B008JFUO72", "B00F4FFO8E", "B001CDR1FG", "B000P0J0EW", "B002T9H2LA", "B0002KVUKM", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00005N5S5", "B0083SBMBM", "B0001BKAEY", "B00AQSN7HE", "B000J10EQU", "B00005JKZY", "B002NXSRVG", "B000AYELVU", "B001OQCV6A", "B004LWZW4M", "B001VLBDD0", "B001GZ6QEC", "B004GJYRA0", "B007REV4T8", "B001TK80C0", "B000HRJLII", "B001QTXM5Y", "B005G4TJUC", "B00005JKZV", "B0053FANT0", "B00005JA8B", "B003YAR97K", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00001ZWUS", "B004EPYZQC", "B001N44BVQ", "B006VRRGNK", "B001AEF6HM", "B00000JQB5", "B00011CZRE", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00AEFY0F2", "B007K3JFUQ", "B0002IQMAM", "B00005JN0T", "B002SJIO4A", "B000VWYJ86", "B0013FDM7E", "B00005JNTI", "B00407PNY2", "B00DTPRZ24", "B008JFUS0U", "B00004Z4WR", "B000FS9FCG", "B000QXDED6", "B0085A9HU6", "0780624890", "B00005LOUK", "B000065U1N", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005JN5T", "B001QB9H1U", "B00005JMUA", "0792844890", "B0007DFJ0G", "B004EPYZSK", "B008JFUOWM", "B00AEFY5B6"], "bought_together": ["B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009JBWOU0", "B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA", "B002ZG980U"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7806}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.99, "brand": "DC Comics", "asin": "B00005JNJV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518zjc4XtzL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Batman Begins (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Despite super effects, a huge budget, and the cinematic pedigree of alien-happy Steven Spielberg, this take on H.G. Wells's novel is basically a horror film packaged as a sci-fi thrill ride. Instead of a mad slasher, however, Spielberg (along with writers Josh Friedman & David Koepp) utilizes aliens hell-bent on quickly destroying humanity, and the terrifying results that prey upon adult fears, especially in the post-9/11 world. The realistic results could be a new genre, the grim popcorn thriller; often you feel like you're watching Schindler's List more than Spielberg's other thrill-machine movies (Jaws,Jurassic Park). The film centers on Ray Ferrier, a divorced father (Tom Cruise, oh so comfortable) who witnesses one giant craft destroy his New Jersey town and soon is on the road with his teen son (Justin Chatwin) and preteen daughter (Dakota Fanning) in tow, trying to keep ahead of the invasion. The film is, of course, impeccably designed and produced by Spielberg's usual crew of A-class talent. The aliens are genuinely scary, even when the film--like the novel--spends a good chunk of time in a basement. Readers of the book (or viewers of the deft 1953 adaptation) will note the variation of whom and how the aliens come to Earth, which poses some logistical problems. The film opens and closes with narration from the novel read by Morgan Freeman, but Spielberg could have adapted Orson Welles's words from the famous Halloween Eve 1938 radio broadcast: \"We couldn't soap all your windows and steal all your garden gates by tomorrow night, so we did the best next thing: we annihilated the world.\"--Doug ThomasWar of the Worldsat Amazon.comThe SoundtrackThe War of the Worlds(1953)War of the Worlds - The Complete First Season(TV series)Classic Sci-Fi Movies and Their RemakesAliens Invade on DVDThe Prog-rock Opera (no kidding)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B00005JL78", "B001SGEUYW", "B00008G8M4", "B00005JL3T", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AEFXNLY", "B00005JMXX", "B001OQCV2E", "B000VECAD0", "B002O3Z510", "B0002V7OI8", "B000H30B2C", "B000EGDB10", "B00005JN2Z", "B005LAIIMG", "B005PTYP70", "B002O3Z50G", "B0002V7ON8", "B00005JN0T", "B00K2CHW48", "B002SJIO4A", "0783225547", "B008JFUO36", "B00005JKLZ", "B00AS1Q93S", "1936594056", "B004EPYZUS", "B001TUZG4K", "B00AEFXR1K", "B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFXYJA", "0767817478", "B0034G4ORC", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00070FX5U", "B0045HCJSA", "B00000G3PA", "B005LAIHPE", "B003Y5H5GK", "B00AEBBA72", "B00003CWU3", "B00I9TDMRM", "B001ECDVKE", "B00003CXXP", "B000V4UFZK", "B0010X73ZG", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00005JKFR", "B000XT1P4S", "B003HKN52U", "B0009PW4D2", "B000HRMAPE", "B004EPYZPS", "B0018QPPXW", "B0002WZTOI", "B00AEBB9LO", "B004LWZW4M", "B003ABZHAO", "B003YJFALS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B000OT6V64", "B004P7CN7W", "B000CCBC9O", "B00000ILDD", "0767803434", "B001L57ZYM", "B000065V3G", "B007STBUHI", "B002ZG980U", "B008JFUQZ2", "B00005B6JZ", "B0006GANOQ", "B000F1IQN2", "1494343576", "B001GCUO02", "B00004Y87O", "0783226810", "B004EPYZSK", "B000P0J0BU", "B005LAIHXQ", "B001680M26", "B000EQHXN2", "B0045HCJFS", "B00004BZIY", "B00008G8M5", "B00003CXQA", "B008JFUS0U", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00EIN6KJ0", "B0000DZ6N3", "B000MV8A9A", "B00005JKYX", "B0000YEEGM", "B000TGJ8CQ", "B0013FCWUW", "B002ZG9864", "B00003CWTI", "B008MIMWQW", "B00IKM5OCO"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBB8VK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBB8VK", "B004LWZW4M", "B00005JL78", "B004EPYZSK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18739}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JNTI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51upxzPRnXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "War of the Worlds"}
{"description": "&#x201C;Hi, everybody!&#x201D; Fans of &#x2019;90s sitcoms know those words mean Steve Urkel has come to call, bringing lots of geeky, goofy fun with him. A spinoff of Perfect Strangers, Family Matters began as the at-home adventures of elevator operator Harriette Winslow and her multigenerational family. But midway through the first season, Jaleel White made a one-shot appearance as neighborhood nerd Urkel. With oversized glasses, undersized body, screechy voice and indomitable self-confidence, Urkel proved irresistibly funny, turning White into an overnight sensation and a new star of the show.

{"description": "The delightful designs of William Joyce (writer/illustrator of such popular children's books asGeorge ShrinksandBently & Egg) makeRobotsa joy to behold. The round, bouncy, and ramshackle forms of hero Rodney Copperbottom and his computer-animated friends are part of an ornate and daffyFender providing assistance.Rube-Goldberg universe of elaborate contraptions and gleaming metallic surfaces.  Rodney (voiced with a hint-of-Scottish lilt by Ewan McGregor) is a young inventor who sets off for Robot City to work for Big Weld (Mel Brooks), the supreme inventor of the mechanical world.  But upon his arrival, Rodney discovers that Big Weld has disappeared, and the slick, shiny Ratchet (Greg Kinnear,As Good As It Gets) is phasing out the spare parts that lumpen robots need to function and replacing them with \"upgrades\"--expensive and glistening new exoskeletons. Unfortunately, from this suitable beginning, the story degenerates into a series of action sequences that make very little sense, though some are kinetic and fun (though others are only there to serve the inevitableRobotsvideo game). Most kids will enjoy the sheer visual pleasure of the movie, but compared to the narrative richness of Pixar movies likeThe IncrediblesandToy Story, that pleasure is pretty short-lived. Also featuring the voices of Robin Williams, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Amanda Bynes, Jennifer Coolidge, and many, many more.--Bret FetzerDVD FeaturesJennifer Coolidge returns as the voice of Aunt Fanny in a mildly amusing new short, \"Aunt Fanny's Tour of Booty,\" which allows her to again be the butt of the joke.  Fans of the characters will enjoy both a 17-minute discussion of the robots' creation as well as profiles of 11 of the bots, including early, almost unrecognizable conceptual sketches and brief interviews with the voice cast.  The original short is fairly dull, and of the three deleted scenes, the most finished is an extended version of Rodney's initial meeting with Tim at the gate.  One other is in sketch form only but does preserve another performance by Robin Williams.  The kids' games are pretty good.  There's a dancing robot that will perform eight routines on command or in random order.  A memory game has a bit of replay value, and the build-a-bot segment takes some thought and investigation.  The Xbox demo is a nifty little diversion that transforms one element (the transport-pod race) of the full-length, single-player Xbox game into a frenetic one- to four-player free-for-all.In their commentary track, director Chris Wedge and producer-inspiration William Joyce have to remind each other to stop patting themselves on the back, but it is interesting to hear them talk about old games such as Mousetrap that played a part in developing the film.  (Wedge's frequent references to a possible \"director's cut\" might not seem like a joke to DVD buyers who have gotten tired of DVD rereleases.)  The commentary track by the Blue Sky technical team might be better, offering insights into the characters and the creation of the film without lapsing into too much techie-speak.--David HoriuchiStills fromRobots(click for larger image)The World ofRobotsThe Art of RobotsRobotssoundtrackRobotsscoreRobotsfor XboxRobotsfor PS2Robotsfor GBA", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006JMLRK", "B000M343BC", "B002WJI2QQ", "B001DPHDCY", "B0012EM5D8", "B004HO6I4M", "B00003CXJ4", "B00CWM58WY", "B000MV9026", "B0006UEVT0", "B001GCUO7A", "0783231474", "B005SDUV4E", "B000RMJ4F8", "B0000640SC", "B000ROAK2W", "B0013FSL3E", "B001LPWGFA", "B004EPZ034", "B001U3D88M", "B000ION23A", "B005LAIISA", "B0000AOX0O", "B000UFIYOO", "B001PR0YEE", "6305161887", "B00029LO0Y", "B008NNY9QW", "B000G75AZC", "B000H7JCK0", "B006JD48LO", "B000L22SG6", "B00B7EQPNE", "B001ECQ75A", "B004AKCME8", "B000AY74OG", "B000VBJEEG", "B00F522C7C", "B000DWMYQ8", "B002ZG97YM", "B008JFUQ16", "B004LWZW7Y", "B000BITUVG", "B0000VV4W2", "B005LAIH4A", "B00003CXG7", "B00005JMQZ", "B00007LVCM", "B0042U94UQ", "B00CHVJODE", "B001PR0Y7Q", "B00E9ZATJO", "B00009M9BK", "0449810798", "B0090SI1RM", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B001KVZ6FW", "1620575175", "B009AMAH3O", "B00I6JOD2S", "B000CZ0PT4", "B0013FSWT2", "B0034G4OYA", "B00AFEX83C", "B000UVKGPI", "B000065V42", "B0039N74CW", "B00JK531ES", "B00HLTD2OE", "B002ZG9904", "B00009YXAW", "6305123454", "B005FLSZQU", "B00005JM7T", "B001GCUNWQ", "B003UESJF6", "B00E00OGE2", "B001HN6918", "B000GUJZ00", "B00I0VTOMG", "B00005JNS0", "B00365F6I2", "B000EQ5UHS", "B000LPS2VI", "B00005JN4W", "B000B8QFYG", "B001NCDFTW", "B0030ZIZRC", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00G5G7EXY", "B007FF3HQM", "B00947N6D8", "B00EBBGLFC", "B005QODEEE", "B00ALMNCLQ", "B00362RUX4", "B00005JN0T", "B000GIXEWC", "B00005TN8K", "B005LAIIT4"], "bought_together": ["B00CWM58WY", "B004HO6I4M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00CWM58WY", "B004HO6I4M", "B002WJI2QQ", "B001DPHDCY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3335}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "Fox Home Entertainment", "asin": "B00005JNQS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61RM90ARRPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Robots (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "The trend is to convertmovies into stage musicals, butThe Producersgoes a step further: making a feature film of the smash-hitstage musicalthat was adapted from the1968 film. The chief drawing card, of course, is Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprising their roles from the stage. Lane plays Max Bialystock, a legendary Broadway producer who hasn't had a hit show in a long time. Enter nebbish accountant Leo Bloom (Broderick), who tells Bialystock he could actually make more money with a flop than a hit. So the two set out to produce the worst Broadway musical of all time, one guaranteed to close on opening night, with the collaboration of an outrageous cast of characters: Will Ferrell as sieg heil-ing author Franz Liebkind, Uma Thurman as Swedish bombshell Ulla, Gary Beach as director Roger De Bris, and Roger Bart as his assistant, Carmen Ghia, among others.As directed and choreographed by Susan Stroman (who did the same honors on Broadway) and co-written by Mel Brooks,The Producersis laugh-out-loud funny. It's also a relentlessly over-the-top, shamelessly bawdy, stereotype-ridden comedy that may turn off its audience just as much as its centerpiece,Springtime for Hitler, was intended to. But Broadway fans who are used to larger-than-life figures who play to the back row while showering the first row with spit, are likely to forgive and just enjoy the famous granny-walker dance, a supporting cast dotted with Broadway performers (playing a taxi driver is Brad Oscar, who originated the role of Liebkind on Broadway then later played Bialystock), or the mere spectacle of seeing Lane and Broderick memorializing the performances that millions never got a ticket to see.

{"description": "Critics and controversy aside,The Da Vinci Codeis a verifiable blockbuster. Combine the film's huge worldwide box-office take with over 100 million copies of Dan Brown's book sold, andThe Da Vinci Codehas clearly made the leap from pop-culture hit to a certifiable franchise. The leap for any story making the move from book to big screen, however, is always more perilous. In the case ofThe Da Vinci Code, the plot is concocted of such a preposterous formula of elements that you wouldn&#x92;t envy screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, the man tasked with making this story filmable. The script followsDan Brown&#x92;s bookas closely as possible while incorporating a few needed changes, including a better ending. And if you&#x92;re like most of the world, by now you&#x92;ve read the book and know how it goes: while lecturing in Paris, noted Harvard Professor of Symbology Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is summoned to the Louvre by French police to help decipher a bizarre series of clues left at the scene of the murder of the chief curator. Enter Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), gifted cryptologist. Neveu and Langdon team up to solve the mystery, and from there the story is propelled across Europe, ballooning into a modern-day mini-quest for the Holy Grail, where secret societies are discovered, codes are broken, and murderous albino monks are thwarted&#x85; oh, and alternative theories about the life of Christ and the beginnings of Christianity are presented too, of course. It&#x92;s not the typical formula for a stock Hollywood thriller. In fact, taken solely as a mystery, the movie almost works--despite some gaping holes--mostly just because it keeps moving. Brown&#x92;s greatest trick was  to have the entire story take place in one day, so the action is forced to keep moving, despite some necessary pauses for exposition. As a screen couple, Hanks and Tautou are just fine together but not exactly memorable; meanwhile Sir Ian McKellen&#x92;s scenery-chewing as pivotal character Sir Leigh Teabing is just what the film needed to keep it from taking itself too seriously. The whole thing is like a good roller-coaster ride: try not to think too much about it--just sit back and enjoy the trip.--Daniel VanciniVisit The Da Vinci Code StoreOn The DVDThe DVD extras on a film as popular asThe Da Vinci Codeshould be plentiful, and this version doesn&#x92;t skimp. With over 90 minutes of special features, including ten behind-the-scenes featurettes, there&#x92;s a lot here to explore beyond the film itself. The question is, is there anything new here that we haven&#x92;t heard before, in all the hype, pseudo-documentaries, and controversy surrounding the movie, to make it worthwhile?  For most viewers, the answer will be \"yes.\" Essentially, if you like the movie, if you enjoyed the book, you will get a lot out of them.Just as the movie is intended to make the book come to life, the DVD extras should make the film come to life by pointing the audience into the world of the filmmakers, connecting the dots between print and film, and for the most part they do just that. The extras here range from the typical look behind-the-scenes to more in-depth features on the supporting characters, the locations, and theMona Lisaherself.  \"First Day on the Set with Ron Howard\" features the director gushing about the opportunity to film in the Louvre and work with Tom Hanks again (the two worked together before onSplashandApollo 13). It&#x92;s a short piece that doesn&#x92;t reveal much beyond making an attempt to share Howard&#x92;s excitement (with the \"Gee, I really loved working with him/her on this project\" that you hear in every such featurette), but viewers might enjoy seeing how the stage was set up in the famous museum, down to the spike tape on the floor showing actors where to hit their marks.The Filmmaking Experience, Parts 1 and 2further explores the creative and technical aspects of the filmmaking process.A Conversation with Dan Brownstarts out feeling like a puff-piece (the man who wrote this book got started at age 5 with a story calledThe Giraffe, The Pig, and the Pants on Fire. \"It was a thriller,\" he says.) and unfortunately it doesn&#x92;t go very deep into much of anything of interest. But on the other hand, this isn&#x92;t60 Minuteshere; it&#x92;s intended to give viewers a better sense of the man behind the franchise, which it does.  Much of the footage from this interview is sprinkled throughout some of the other featurettes. Meanwhile, the character behind the franchise, Robert Langdon, is examined in his own featurette, as is Sophie Neveu. The cool thing here is getting under the skin of the actors to see how they approached the characters, knowing that most of the movie-going public already has formed their own ideas about the characters from the book.The most interesting extras are the featurettes that focus on the history behind the mystery. Or is it the mystery behind the history?  Either way, the first one on theMona Lisa, and the second featurette on the many codes and symbols that are hidden throughout the movie balance out the remainder of the extras nicely by demonstrating the sense of intrigue, mystery, and game-playing adventure that madeThe Da Vinci Codeso popular in the first place.--Daniel VanciniBeyondThe Da Vinci CodeThe Films of Tom HanksThe Films of Ron HowardThe Da Vinci DVDs: Decoding \"The Da Vinci Code\"More About The ArtistStills fromThe Da Vinci Code(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00005JN5E", "B0013BM63O", "B002ZTQVKM", "B0007XG02W", "B001OLP2TI", "B002C68WNW", "0307474275", "B002O5M4SU", "B00005JLSB", "B000PHVZNE", "B0077ATSSQ", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000EPR7NE", "0743486226", "B001LMAK9W", "B000P0J0EW", "0385504209", "B005HWAOP2", "B001OQCV2E", "B0013XZ2QK", "B001EZE5D8", "B00005JL3T", "B000EOTW0Q", "6304711891", "B000YDBPAM", "0307950689", "B000HT386M", "B00008G8M4", "B000P0J0EM", "B002ZG99KO", "0800141806", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00001ZWUS", "B0002V7OI8", "B002O3Z50Q", "B0006GANOQ", "B002NZK5UU", "B000NQRR1Q", "0385504225", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00005Y71F", "B000OYC7BW", "B00DL48BM6", "B00026ZG10", "B0018CWW5K", "B00004BZIY", "B0000B1OFL", "B00023B1LC", "B000N6U0E2", "B00A8MGIZG", "B00005JM5E", "B002LMV7R0", "B00004Z4WR", "B000K2UGXO", "B00005JMYC", "B001MVYUQG", "B00005JLWN", "B000056PMU", "B0000AOV4I", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00441GYXS", "B001F12J0C", "B00ES28X3C", "B002ZG980U", "B001VLBDD0", "B00008K76U", "B001TK80C0", "B008JFURII", "B000VWYJ86", "0792159659", "B00AEFYGBA", "B0009MDPYM", "B00177YA1K", "B00005N5S5", "B0043X1FM2", "B0002J58HO", "B00005JM5B", "B00AZMFJYA", "B003AWRMBA", "074349346X", "B003VA3JUO", "0783240295", "6305767866", "B0000844I8", "B000065U1N", "B002GHHHKQ", "B000K7VHQE", "B0000AXE8I", "0800177258", "B000ASDFGI", "B003Q6D2B4", "B000HRMAPE", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JMOW", "B00GPWEPZ8", "0312944926", "B000VI70QS", "B000KF0GWW"], "bought_together": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00005JN5E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00I563DSC", "B0013BM63O", "1400079152"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7555}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.5, "brand": "DaVinci", "asin": "B00005JOC9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SLBDLMtIL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Da Vinci Code (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)"}

{"description": "Helen Mirren reigns supreme inThe Queen, a witty and ingenious look at a moment that rocked the house of Windsor:  the week that followed the sudden death of Princess Diana in 1997. Diana's death came at just the same time that Prime Minister Tony Blair (played by the bright Michael Sheen) was settling into his new government--and trying to figure out the delicate relationship between 10 Downing Street and Queen Elizabeth II (Mirren). A large portion of the British population was trying to figure out the Windsors that week, as Elizabeth remained stiff-upper-lip and largely mum about the death of the beloved princess. In Peter Morgan's skillful script, we watch as Blair grows increasingly impatient with the Royals, who are sequestered in their Scottish estate while the public demands some show of grief. Prince Philip (James Cromwell, in good form) clumsily decides to take Diana's sons hunting, while a sympathetically-treated Prince Charles (Alex Jennings) displays some frustration with his mother's eerie calm.None of this conveys how funny the film is, or how deftly it flows from one scene to the next. Director Stephen Frears (Dirty Pretty Things) deserves great credit for that, and for the performances, and for the movie's marvelous sense of well-roundedness; you could see this movie and groan at the cluelessness of the Royals and their outmoded existence, or you might just sympathize with showing reserve in a world that values gross public displays of emotion. But either way, you'll marvel at Mirren, who makes the Queen far more alert and human than one might ever have imagined.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B003UESJH4", "B001C4AFOY", "B004M9QNVK", "B004GXKBDI", "B0059XTUVI", "B000Z8H0IC", "B000ZOXDFA", "B000RF7XYO", "B001L57ZZG", "B001TH92N4", "B000BKDNX0", "B0006Q93H4", "B000EOTELI", "B004XYOQU4", "B009TT0BSE", "B0012QE4Q2", "B001QUF3SW", "B007HW8U2Y", "B000EHQUGC", "B00342ANSA", "B004SIP9U6", "B000V02CNW", "B00005O7N8", "B00GM7STPI", "B003N9ASF2", "B002ZG99EK", "B004SIP71M", "B003Y5H4Y8", "B0001I55M4", "B001AZIRVI", "B00015HXDG", "B000E1NXJ0", "B000RF7XYY", "B00121QGPY", "B009AMANBA", "B000M06KJ8", "B000MEYJHY", "B00005JOFQ", "B007TBJUVI", "B0085A9JXG", "B003AND1SM", "B000NIVJF4", "B0010X73Z6", "B000K7VHQE", "B00005JKNF", "B000MCH5P4", "B001TR4G6W", "B004P7CNZO", "B0050PYNN0", "B000GH3CR0", "B00AEFY8MM", "B0068MNO4S", "B002RSDW80", "B001MVWFAO", "B004ZNFTDQ", "B000255LIY", "B000V6LSOA", "B00ARX2VZW", "B000G6BM0K", "B008220C38"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003UESJH4", "B004M9QNVK", "B001C4AFOY", "B004GXKBDI"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPAM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K34G0GCBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Queen"}
{"description": "Aaron Sorkin, bless him, believes that \"the people who watch television shows aren't dumber than the people who make television shows.\" He also believes that  \"quality is not anathema to profit.\" He puts these idealistic words into the mouth of Jordan McDeere (Amanda Peet), the new, impolitic NBS TV president whose first order of business is to revitalize the network's cash cow,Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, a long-running live late-night sketch-comedy series reeling from the Howard Beale-esque on-air meltdown of its creator (Judd Hirsch, alas, limited to the pilot episode). With this Upstairs/Backstage look atStudio 60's tumultuous network politics and stormy personal relationships, Sorkin, the creator ofSports NightandThe West Wing, once again tried to raise the bar of prime time fare. That he didn't quite clear it makes this one-season wonder a fascinating object lesson of great hopes and dashed expectations.Studio 60was perhaps the most hotly debated series of the 2006 season and, love it or hate it, all its strengths and flaws can be savored and savaged anew with this complete-series set.Pretty much above reproach is the ensemble. Matthew Perry and Bradley Whitford head the cast as comedy writer Matt and executive producer Danny, formerStudio 60hands whom Jordan brings back to \"save\" the show. Steven Weber costars as network chairman Jack Rudolph, who clashes with Jordan over reality programming (he wants it, she doesn't), is embroiled in network negotiations with China, and must fend off angry affiliates offended by such sketches as \"Crazy Christians.\" Jordan contends with becoming tabloid fodder after her ex-husband leaks scandalous details of their past. Meanwhile, Matt, a sardonic atheist, is in a whole Ross and Rachel thing with Harriet (Emmy nominee Sarah Paulson), who is devoutly religious and the show's galvanizing star performer (she does do a mean Holly Hunter).Studio 60has much to say about comedy in wartime, the divided states of America, the creative process, and patriotism. Some of it is deftly handled, some of it is ham-handed and some of it patronizing. Most of it is delivered in Sorkin's signature chock-a-block style and with walk-and-talk urgency. But even at its most maddening, there are enough riveting moments (a performance by displaced New Orleans musicians in \"The Christmas Show\"), jaw-dropping developments (\"I'm coming for you, Jordan,\" warns Danny, suddenly-turned romantic stalker), and indelible performances (John Goodman's Emmy-winning turn as a plain-speaking Pahrump, NV judge not impressed with the Hollywood types before him in the two-part \"Nevada Day\") to makeStudio 60a series worth revisiting, if only as a guilty pleasure.  The pilot episode commentary by Sorkin and director Thomas Schlamme, as well as a behind-the-scenes featurette, were produced before the show was canceled, robbing this series' fervent fans of the opportunity for some closure.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001B187BQ", "B0092QH902", "B0030ATZIK", "B001KGDNAW", "B005DTGBLK", "B00005JLF3", "B0007XG2FW", "B000HC2LI0", "B00E3HDW3I", "B005OK0YIY", "B000EGEJI4", "B000BB1MIM", "B000HC2LHQ", "B0001HAGQK", "B0007OY2N0", "B0092QHXZS", "B00KTZALDC", "B00KYCA4QY", "B000NY0YKE", "B007K7IAGM", "B003LXM1PK", "B007PKSO2Y", "B006OV7RQ4", "B000E3L7F0", "B000FIMG6I", "B0025KVKDO", "B0019Z3P84", "B003LXM1B4", "B0002WZN9Y", "B00J82PU92", "B00A8KJN8M", "B002TQKL7A", "B000FL7CB4", "B007PKSNEI", "B0016OOM6W", "B007Y5G1RA", "B00J5LXT44", "B00BQ364PA", "B008BLCP0S", "B000FTCF9A", "B00CKJJ1G8", "B0055SNHQG", "B001AQT158", "B00JAOW3MA", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B0000AQS0F", "B0007CEXUY", "B000S8CLR4", "B00540G3GG", "B009DA74O8", "B00E3UN44W", "B007KAUWO2", "B003R0MF6W", "0755313216", "B00HUCF420", "1469971879", "B0013XZ2QK", "B00BYS0WGE", "B0012GMW9S", "B000FUTVPA", "B0001EQHXO", "B00BUWD7Y8", "B00JHH1VDC", "B007PTCP7K", "B001D2WUDE", "B002FU8IWU", "B00CPEK3OM", "B000ATQYXI", "B00E3HDWRE", "B00KTFJ7UA", "B009Z59ZNE", "B001AR011U", "B00BM2JVAA", "B002PQ7JR4", "B00J5LXN2M", "B00BOTCHRU", "B00BVMXBDO", "B000FL7CAK", "B00HEQOAQ8", "B000N3T0EG", "B000FTC1GW", "B00005JLZW", "B00HNGC516", "B0025KVKBQ", "B009D1G9S4", "B002C3GTLC", "B001ASIHZG", "B0014Z4OM0", "B00E5G03I4", "B008PJZDXW", "B00JHH1YQG", "B00IBQ5M1W", "B0030BOCMS", "B00DI013EG", "B003K2G0TA", "B00AEFZ3XU", "B00007CVSP", "B00GPWEPZ8", "B007MDB6RO"], "bought_together": ["B001B187BQ", "B0092QH902"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001B187BQ", "B0092QH902", "B000HC2LHQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9712}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 11.67, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JPI6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513ehi01y4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip - The Complete Series"}

{"description": "Special features abound on this two-disc special edition and there's something for every age. Adults will find the commentary track featuring Jerry Seinfeld and directors Simon Smith and Steven Hickner, co-writer Barry Marder, co-producer Christina Steinberg, and editor Nick Fletcher exceptionally interesting and funny; their dialogue covers movie trivia, technical challenges, descriptions of alternate and cut scenes, strange coincidences like running into and then casting Ray Liotta, and the scientific discovery of bee colony collapse during the time period of the movie's creation.

{"description": "For anyone who thought the Oscar-winning documentaryMarch of the Penguinswas the most marvelous cinematic moment for these nomads of the south, you haven't seen nothing yet.Happy Feetis an animated wonder about a penguin named Mumble who can't sing, but can dance up a storm. George Miller, the driving force behind theBabe(andMad Max) movies, takes another creative step in family entertainment with this big, beautiful, music-fueled film that will have kids and their parents dancing in the streets. From his first moment alive, Mumble (voiced Elijah Woods) feels the beat and can't stop dancing. Unfortunately, emperor penguins are all about finding their own heart song, and the dancing youngster--as cute as he is--is a misfit. Luckily, he bumps into little blue penguins and a Spanish-infused group (led by Robin Williams) and begins a series of adventures. Miller has an exceptional variety of entertainment: Busby Berkley musical numbers, amusement-park thrills, exciting chase sequences (seals and orca lovers might like think otherwise), and even an environmental message that doesn't weigh you down. Best of all, you don't know where the movie is going in the last act, a rare occurrence these days in family entertainment. A fusion of rock songs, mashed-up and otherwise, are featured; this movie is as much a musical as a comedy. Mumble's solo dance to a new version of Stevie Wonder's \"I Wish\" by Fantasia, Patti, and Yolanda may be the most joyful moment on camera in 2006.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006UEVT0", "B001DPHDCY", "B0006JMLRK", "B0012EM5D8", "B004HO6I4M", "B004EPZ0AC", "B002WJI2QQ", "B000AY74OG", "B0000AOX0O", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B00005JNQS", "B000RMJ4F8", "B0000640SC", "B005SDUV4E", "0783231474", "B00003CXJ4", "B00CWM58WY", "B0000VV4W2", "B0042U94UQ", "B0039N74CW", "6305161887", "B00AEFXMSS", "B000M343BC", "B00007LVCM", "B001ECQ75A", "B00005JNS0", "B00000JL8E", "B000GUJZ00", "B000056H26", "B008NNY9QW", "B004EPZ034", "B00G5G7EXY", "B000LPS2VI", "B005LAIH4A", "B00F522C7C", "B005LAIISA", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B007FF3HQM", "B000VBJEEG", "B003H9M1Q2", "B00029LO0Y", "B008JFUQ16", "B00005JMQZ", "B00EV1YZ96", "B000ION23A", "B0013FSL3E", "B003ZHVJGO", "B002ZG97YM", "B001NCDFTW", "B004G600A4", "B00009YXAW", "B005LAIHW2", "B00AFEX83C", "B00475B0H6", "B000UVKGPI", "B00ALMNCLQ", "B00HLTD2OE", "B00005JM7T", "B001HN6922", "B000BI5KV0", "B0013FSWT2", "B0030IIZ4M", "B004ODLUGM", "B001GCUO7A", "B005F96UJ6", "B000UFIYOO", "B000G75AZC", "B00005QFE1", "B0000VCZKW", "B00IEXX4KS", "B001THIQFO", "B000A2WAQK", "B001GCUNWQ", "B00B7EQPNE", "B002NZK5SW", "B0007PIDBQ", "B00AOCDDGC", "B000V5IP6U", "B0044RFTD8", "B00AEFXMGU", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00CHVJODE", "B000CZ0PT4", "B006JD48LO", "B0007Z0NYG", "B00EBBGLFC", "B00003CXB4", "B000BMGEJI", "B008YWY0HK", "B0002YLCOM", "B00E9ZATJO", "B004A8ZX3C", "B00I6JOD2S", "B005G3VCYY", "B00CQRN3QI", "B004OWQTZ0", "B0001OGUQI", "B004EPZ01G", "B00005JMFH", "B000GIXEWC"], "bought_together": ["B004HO6I4M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004HO6I4M", "B00EBBGLFC", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00HR3D56O"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 21763}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.51, "brand": "Warner", "asin": "B00005JPCF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51sX2Hrdz6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Happy Feet (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "The Dark Knightarrives with tremendous hype (best superhero movie ever? posthumous Oscar for Heath Ledger?), and incredibly, it lives up to all of it.  But calling it the best superhero movie ever seems like faint praise, since part of what makes the movie great--in addition to pitch-perfect casting, outstanding writing, and a compelling vision--is that it bypasses the normal fantasy element of the superhero genre and makes it all terrifyingly real.  Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is Gotham City's new district attorney, charged with cleaning up the crime rings that have paralyzed the city. He enters an uneasy alliance with the young police lieutenant, Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), and Batman (Christian Bale), the caped vigilante who seems to trust only Gordon--and whom only Gordon seems to trust. They make progress until a psychotic and deadly new player enters the game: the Joker (Heath Ledger), who offers the crime bosses a solution--kill the Batman. Further complicating matters is that Dent is now dating Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, after Katie Holmes turned down the chance to reprise her role), the longtime love of Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne.In his last completed role before his tragic death, Ledger is fantastic as the Joker, a volcanic, truly frightening force of evil. And he sets the tone of the movie: the world is a dark, dangerous place where there are no easy choices.  Eckhart and Oldman also shine, but as good as Bale is, his character turns out rather bland in comparison (not uncommon for heroes facing more colorful villains). Director-cowriter Christopher Nolan (Memento) follows his critically acclaimedBatman Beginswith an even better sequel that sets itself apart from notable superhero movies likeSpider-Man 2andIron Manbecause of its sheer emotional impact and striking sense of realism--there are no suspension-of-disbelief superpowers here. At 152 minutes, it's a shade too long, and it's much too intense for kids. But for most movie fans--and not just superhero fans--The Dark Knightis a film for the ages.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B000PC6A3E", "B002ZG981E", "B00G4RD4PQ", "B0039208QM", "B001GMALGY", "B00E2Y0YBK", "B00C2IGQBA", "B0039208JE", "B00H14WTLQ", "B0039208CG", "B0085D3I3K", "B0039208C6", "B000M5AJQI", "B00319ECGK", "B001FB55H6", "B00EIG5M5A", "7020070078", "B00E2Y6AUY", "B00D5FMGGS", "B001OQCV6K", "B0013FBS20", "B000Q6GX5Y", "B001GKJ2FC", "B00FPS79F6", "B001992NUQ", "B004JMSIRC", "B001RIY4WE", "B00DYEN6XC", "B008QZ5PY2", "B001F7MSG6", "B00FAHYNWE", "B00J7PRJXU", "B001AQT0Z4", "B001UV4XEW", "B0083SBJXS", "B00AEFY552", "B00C8RD79O", "B007KAJG3K", "B007L4HET8", "B004EPZ07U", "B007L4HFDI", "B00AEFXKOO", "B000PC0U1W", "B00C6B8TB8", "B00HINFI4K", "B003TT2X6I", "B001KZIRM2", "B002ZG99NG", "B00EZ4M68G", "B004SIP90G", "B003ZHR6RK", "B001GCUO16", "B003TT2X6S", "B00JNEWSLS", "B001F3FUK6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B002ZG981E", "B000PC6A3E"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPY0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pGxSkkz4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Dark Knight [Theatrical Release]"}
{"description": "After the horror-triptych format proved a box-office winner inTales of Terror,Twice Told Talesrepeated the idea&#x85; this time not with Edgar Allan Poe stories, but the work of Nathaniel Hawthorne. Good idea, as Hawthorne delivered some eerie stories in his time, but the execution here is less than scintillating. The first story, \"Dr. Heidegger's Experiment,\" is the most entertaining of the bunch, in part because Vincent Price (the star of all three stories, natch) and Sebastian Cabot appear to be enjoying the premise:  two old friends discover a Fountain of Youth elixir. This will come in handy in erasing their own wrinkles and gray hair, as well as reviving the corpse of Cabot's long-dead bride&#x85; but be careful what you wish for. The second is \"Rappaccini's Daughter,\" with Price as an overly protective father with a novel way to keep his daughter from the sins of the flesh. It is fatally dull, and the final segment, a severe condensation of Hawthorne's novel \"The House of the Seven Gables,\" is even more annoying, although at least it moves along a bit. The story does offer foxy scream queen Beverly Garland in her prime. Journeyman director Sidney Salkow is responsible for the deadly pace, which leaves only Vincent Price as the reason to watch the proceedings. He's just dandy, but the Roger Corman films of the same era are the ones to see.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00009PY4D", "B00005AUK0", "B00009PY4A", "B005AMJ3B0", "B000068TPF", "B00009PY45", "B00009NHBC", "B00000K3U3", "B0007R4SZY", "B00005K3OD", "B001BSBBGC", "B006TTC5J0", "B00FGAKEU0", "B008FYZJ1S", "B000RXVNDI", "B000FWHW90", "B000063UR0", "B00004R99Y", "B00008973G", "B000035Z3K", "B0007R4T2Q", "B00DZP1C9K", "B0007R4T12", "B000TUDBGG", "B0088XQDTS", "B001BSBBNK", "B00001TZ6Q", "B00005O075", "B00005LC4O", "B005AMJ36U", "B000RO9PUU", "B0009X770O", "B000067J0M", "B00006G8H3", "B0000648YE", "B007IHH35I", "B00B2M7ENG", "B000068TPE", "B001D8W7EU", "B000083C6R", "B00005KA6N", "B000787YRM", "B000A2XC3U", "B002DU0RFS", "B000A7LR96"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005AMJ3B0", "B00009PY4D", "B000787YRM", "B00DZP1C9K"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 207249}, "asin": "B00005K3OG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TSJFYWX7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Twice-told Tales"}

When beautiful but reclusive goth teenager Ginger (Katharine Isabelle) is attacked by a monstrous wolf on the eve of her first period, her body starts changing in a big way, as do her suddenly lusty, feral appetites. Director John Fawcett masterfully balances the expectations of teen horror exploitation (blood, bodies, sex, smart dialogue, and good old-fashioned monster-movie scares) with clever black humor and tender sisterly solidarity. Only devoted sister Brigitte (gloomy Emily Perkins) knows the truth, and even as Ginger's abrupt transformation threatens their once unbreakable friendship, bonds of blood and love keep them together: Brigitte disposes of Ginger's victims while searching for a cure. Mimi Rogers costars as their dotty but unexpectedly sensitive mom, ready to sacrifice all to protect her daughter.

{"description": "Culled from 30 years of material, this collection of moments fromThe Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carsoncontains some of most inspired bits of lunacy ever recorded. Whether cajoling with Hollywood's biggest stars or normal folk with special talents, Carson was a master of finding the right joke, with timing second to none. Along with bits of his opening monologues, skits, and early standup appearances from the likes of David Letterman and Eddie Murphy, there are many highlights with perhaps the perfect Carson guest--exotic animals that stole the show. This collection was released shortly after Carson's reign ended in 1992. Although most of the tapes of his first decade are lost, there are plenty of highlights from the '70s through the '90s. Also included is Carson's touching and historic \"Final Show,\" which finds the host simply talking to his audience and showing highlights--or just the faces--from his years on the set. Although many followed--and a few have even succeeded--Carson's Midwest charm made him the king of TV in a period when America was defined by television.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_viewed": ["630306678X", "B00009V45K"]}, "price": 24.01, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 365743}, "asin": "B000068WS6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51W26E5FD7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Carson Collection - His Favorite Moments from The Tonight Show (1962-1992) [VHS]"}

There's nothing fancy about the plot--the soldiers hole up in a farmhouse  and desperately try to fend off the werewolves until dawn--but the script  is full of smart dialogue and clever ideas, the direction is dynamic, and  the performances (from Kevin McKidd, Sean Pertwee, Emma Cleasby, and Liam  Cunningham, among a solid cast of relative unknowns) are strong and  committed throughout.Dog Soldierspays homage toNight of the  Living Dead,Aliens, andThe Evil Dead, among other  films, but the references are woven into the fabric of the movie.

{"description": "This first movie from the Discovery Channel favorite opens with a plot of international intrigue over a downed satellite, but within four minutes Steve Irwin is belly flopping after a baby croc on the outback floor. Steve and his nerves-of-steel sidekick wife, Terri, are asked to relocate a cattle-chomping crocodile before it's shot by a local rancher. This same reptile happened to swallow the intelligence-gathering device that fell to earth, and so begins the goofball premise of this lark of a movie. The feds believe the Irwins are appropriating their classified info, and the Irwins think they're running from poachers. Quibblers may object to Irwin's frequent interruptions to introduce a bird-eating spider or paw through croc dung, butCrocodile Hunterfans wouldn't have it any other way.

At first, the tone is creepy as Cusack dreads the terrors of sharing a bed with Sellers, but it becomes more poignant as both characters learn to see each other as people.  The script gives Sellers a lot of funny business, acid lines, and whimsical turns, but he plays Hoffman as a repressed soul half-ashamed of his attempts to be funny, telling genuinely good jokes as if he expects no one will laugh. Cusack, more interesting than expected, keeps up with her costar and almost makes the strangely upbeat last reel believable.--Kim Newman", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0016LFG5Q", "B001LXIDUY", "B001IHJ988", "B003NTVW7U", "B0007XBKPE", "B004H9X4CG", "B001US0P7E", "B00009MEKJ", "B00005JKH9", "B0007XBKOU", "B00C3ALLDA", "B005STRLEQ", "B00005JL0I", "B000XJD34I", "B003NTUOGU", "6305228892", "B001IHJ974", "B0001Y9YKW", "B00C3ALLZ8", "B00004U0FP", "6305308748", "B0009IW8OE", "B0007ZEOQE", "B00005RDRO", "1572525509", "0002166496", "B001AY0FV4", "0786866640", "1852276231", "0860516342"], "bought_together": ["B0016LFG5Q", "B001LXIDUY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001LXIDUY", "B00005JKH9", "B0007XBKOU", "B0016LFG5Q"]}, "price": 19.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 45718}, "asin": "B00007AJE8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41rY2JSnnNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hoffman"}

{"description": "Growing up in New York City, George Carlin was always the class clown.  He went on to become one of the greatest comedians of all time, with appeal that spans generations.  His brand of provocative sociopolitical commentary and scathing comic style has brought him four Grammy awards, most recently in 2002.  Carlin holds the distinct honor of being the first-ever host of NBC's Saturday Night Live, and has starred in 12 HBO specials and many blockbuster films.  He continues to perform to sold-out audiences at venues across the country.\"Back in Town\" aired as a live broadcast from New York City's Beacon Theater and features Carlin's trademark acerbic observations on topics such as abortion, capital punishment, familiar expressions and bodily functions.

{"description": "Director Luigi Cozzi's science fiction thriller, which borrows wholesale fromAlienfor its loopy plot, is a gleefully cheesy gorefest that should please horror fans with a fondness for the lowbrow. Long-suffering Eurocult Ian McCulloch (Zombie) stars as an astronaut who joins an investigation into the appearance of extraterrestrial eggs on a ghost ship in New York's harbor. Their search uncovers an Earth-based conspiracy to cultivate the eggs for world domination. Despite the abundant gore and lunk-headed script,Contaminationhas an endearingly naive tone that suggests '50s-era B science fiction (of which Cozzi is a fan); as such, one can't be too harsh on a film that displays its affections so openly. Amazingly,Contaminationhas been banned in England since being named in the \"video nasty\" debacle of the early '80s. Blue Underground's widescreen DVD is uncut (with 5.1 Dolby and DTS sound!), and should be a welcome addition to any cult collector's cache.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00LMBUR6S", "B00LBFFR2Y", "B00LT1JHLW", "B00LMBURDG", "B00LFN00GU", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B000TZJCNW", "B00KL3TT8A", "B00KTFJ50M", "B00A429Y56", "B00KNSJVEA", "B000AC7P5Q", "B00DOZNGTK", "B00BCMSY80", "B00K1L4NBU", "B000S0GYRK", "B0036R92UI", "B000HXDWNM", "B000063K1F", "B000TZJCOG", "B00L22H2IS", "B00HRUQB8Q", "B000TZJCMS", "B00CPTUNUG", "B0057O6IMS", "B000TZJCNM", "B000MV8ZCW", "B00C1PKRJ6", "B00009WNXA", "B0057O6IDW", "B008DRKJ76", "B000RPCJA2", "0783228457", "B000096I9V", "B0002C9DK4", "B001B187L6", "B003QLECZY", "B00HRUQ7WG", "B00I31COHA", "B00AJXO4FA", "B000V6LT6C", "B000TZJCNC", "B000S0GYRU", "B0012IV3SC", "B004KDYR20", "B002GPVDMG", "B0012IV3S2", "B00GHH9IIA", "B00GBJWY76", "B001D5C1R6", "B004SL04WQ", "B001HZ4KD0", "B0072GPQ8G", "B00005U12U", "B00GOT1DIE", "B0036R92US", "B008I34YOE", "B00AWWX6XY", "B004GF3IJU", "B00IA1VKVY", "B00GHH9GSC", "B00006FMC2", "B00005RDAI", "B00IQHPS6A", "B000B64TZA", "B00JHH1VSW", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B002E01MI8", "B00FUABK36", "B00B49GSQQ", "B00IPAORFG", "B00FUABJJQ", "B00018YCTQ", "B00E5S2HGS", "B00CU00JTU", "B000KN9F6W", "B00K8EVSVI", "B002E01MHY", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B0018BA72G", "B001D5C1OO", "B00CPTUNWO", "B004GYKNHQ", "B000AM6MVO", "B009IV2Z3M", "B00DPUB57Y", "B00GSTHD1G", "B0053TWW9K", "B00JJOY45U", "B00BCMT2BI", "B00JV054A6", "B007ZFSBWW", "B0000C8AUD", "B00C7A8WZQ", "B00023P4SS", "B0000694YT", "B00C7E3EDW", "B00I462XNO", "B004FUPK6U", "B002TLRGAU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00862WFK2", "B0036R92US", "B003NHMYHO", "B00005U12U"]}, "price": 12.58, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 498007}, "asin": "B00007L4MC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N4VSVKMVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Contamination"}

{"description": "Set in the year 3000,Futuramais the acme of sci-fi animated  sitcom fromSimpsonscreator Matt Groening. While not as universally  popular asThe Simpsons,Futuramais equally hip and hilarious,  thanks to its zippy lateral-thinking contemporary pop cultural references,  celebrity appearances (Pamela Anderson and Leonard Nimoy are among a number of  guest stars to appear as disembodied heads in jars), and Bender, a distinctly  Homer Simpson-esque robot. Part ofFuturama's charm is that with decades  of sci-fi junk behind us, we've effectively been living with the distant future  for years and can now have fun with it. Hence, the series stylishly jumbles  motifs ranging fromLost in Space-style kitsch to the grim dystopia ofBlade Runner. It also bridges the gap between the impossible dreams of  your average science fiction fan and the slobbish reality of their comic  reading, TV-watching existence. Groening himself distinguishes his two series  thus: \"The Simpsonsis fictional.Futuramais real.\"The opening season (premiered in 1999) sees nerdy pizza delivery boy Fry  transferred to the 31st century in a cryogenic mishap. There, he meets the  beautiful, one-eyed Leela (voiced byMarried with Children's Katey Sagal)  and the incorrigible alcoholic robot Bender. The three of them join Fry's great  (great, great, etc.) nephew Professor Farnsworth and work in his intergalactic  delivery service. Hyper-real yet strangely recognizable situations ensue--Fry  discovers he's a billionaire thanks to 1,000 years' accrued interest, Leela must  fend off the attentions of Captain Kirk-like Lothario Zapp Brannigan, and Fry  accidentally drinks the ruler of a strange planet of liquid beings.--David  Stubbs", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008YGRS", "B008412UQ4", "B007ZFR67I", "B004696M94", "B005QIOJUI", "B008AITJ7O", "B000UZDO62", "B00158K0V0", "B001DZOC78", "B001MT7ZI8", "B00F77MAO0", "B001DZOC46", "B004696MAS", "B001MT7ZII", "B005QIOJWQ", "B008AITJ7E", "B000E6ES9O", "B00F77MARM", "B0012KSUTA", "B00LFW6BA0", "B0007PAM10", "B000083C6V", "B000NNK4DM", "B000HT3P6U", "B000RO6JZO", "B000AQ68Z0", "B00005JM3G", "B00023P49C", "B001RIZ7OI", "B00008YGRV", "B0000CABL2", "B0012018OE", "B007KFZ7PG", "B003CN5B7E", "B004I7YVJ2", "B007KFZ85K", "B007KFZ7YM", "B003L77G9W", "B00023P49M", "B000BQPC42", "B001GQ3GHG", "B0001ZWLVU", "B00E0FW054", "B007KFZ87S", "B003L77G7Y", "B007KFZ8B4", "B007KFZ88M", "B0058YPMHO", "B0055P2ISM", "B007KFZ7Q0", "B001VFM0ZG", "B007KFZ8AA", "B0053O8A32", "B000067DNE", "B007KFZ7UQ", "0060739096", "B00K8HAJN8", "B00CO8WWS4", "B00BYNL8DU", "B00008YGRZ", "B0007PAM06", "B00ITV5SRC", "B007KFZ8AK", "B00775R45A", "B000EMGIDC", "B00CI920Q8", "B00527GQ6I", "B003H4RBA8", "B00DEN5MOY", "B000AQ68VO", "B00006IGVK", "B003DZX46G", "B0058JEHTS", "B00F4NPBI4", "B000EHSVDC", "B0030Y11NS", "B000R7I3XC", "0810988372", "B0002XVQT4", "B0058JEHSO", "B000ADWCYY", "B0006Z2L2Y", "B003KZ27N0", "B0025KVKBQ", "B0024FAR52", "B00BTRKMNI", "0060505982", "B0000AQS89", "B0050IK85E", "B000KLQUMQ", "B000RW3VDE", "B000A3DFV8", "B000M7XRC4", "B009LDD40U", "B005QIOJ3A", "B002ZXZJ1A", "B00006G8J7", "B00005JNEQ", "B00HDU9UOW"], "bought_together": ["B008412UQ4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00F77MAO0", "B008AITJ7O", "B00F77MAC2", "B00008YGRS"]}, "price": 25.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 94961}, "asin": "B000083C6W", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5178M160SXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Futurama: Volume One"}
{"description": "With the original conspiracy plot arc having fallen into a muddle of  loose ends, once-hungry lead actors on the verge of big-screen careers and  making demands for more time off or shots at writing and directing, and the  initial wish list of monsters-of-the-week long exhausted, it's a miracle that by  its seventh seasonThe X-Fileswas still making its airdates, let alone  managing something pretty good every other show and something outstanding at  least once every four episodes.

{"description": "Is Duvinder guilty? Or is he innocent? Share the tension and the excitement as the jury decides.John Maher (Billy Scott) lay dead in the grass, the victim of 28 well-placed stab wounds. A stolen sword coated in blood lands near the 15-year-old schoolboy's body. It's clearly a case of unrestrained vengeance. John's Sikh schoolmate, Duvinder Singh (Sonnell Dadral), hated him. Hated him enough to commit murder. A horrendous, premeditated murder in cold blood. Or so we're told.We're also told this gentle, intelligent boy is incapable of killing. He's innocent. Chilling suspense fills \"The Jury\" as the highly publicized trial pits Sikh and Anglo communities against each other. Logic against intuition. Pride against shame. The jurors must decide what side they're on - both inside the courtroom, and outside.Award-winning actor Sir Derek Jacobi (Gosford Park; Gladiator; I, Claudius) stars as George Cording QC (queen's council). As Duvinder's lawyer, he must convince the jury of the young boy's innocence in the face of compelling evidence that suggests otherwise. Cording knows his only hope is to confront the evidence head on and expose a scathing case of prejudice.

{"description": "Since winning an Academy Award for his exuberant performance inJerry Maguire, Cuba Gooding Jr. has gotten little but static from critics for a spate of calamitous career choices not seen since '80s-vintage Burt Reynolds. But he triumphantly returns to Oscar-worthy status with his moving performance as Radio, a mentally challenged young man, whom South Carolina high school football coach Harold Jones (Ed Harris) takes under his nurturing wing. This does not play well with the school's patient but questioning principal (Alfre Woodard); the school's biggest athletic booster, who views Radio as a distraction; the man's son, the team's star player, who plays cruel pranks on the trusting Radio; and the Coach's teenage daughter, who feels neglected. Almost all will be won over by Radio's trusting and good nature. Based on aSports Illustratedstory,Radiowas adapted for the screen by Mike Rich, screenwriter ofThe Rookie, and as in that superior family film, the heroics are mostly off the field. As Coach says, with all the subtlety of a blitz, \"We're not the ones been teaching Radio; he's the one been teaching us.\" The ending, in which we see the actual Radio, still cheering his team on 26 years later, will melt the most cynical hearts.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JPBO", "B002VECM6S", "B000056VP4", "B000066HAS", "B00004W221", "B000J3OTT6", "B000EXZFCQ", "0792843592", "6305531293", "B00AEFXOKO", "B000068NNU", "B001LGXIA6", "B002NZK5UK", "0788815466", "B000KHYN9C", "6305428352", "B0001US66Y", "B000N6U0E2", "B00000IQV7", "B00004TJQJ", "B002D755AI", "B00125WAWS", "B0006FYOTC", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00005JNEW", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00KPYT9PS", "B000FVQLQQ", "B000KLQUS0", "B0068FZ0GK", "B000Q7ZNZ4", "B002VWNIBI", "B000K2UGZM", "B001FB55NK", "B004KPLVX6", "B00722MQE2", "B0026S2TU8", "B004DK5CW4", "B0001ADAVK", "630542845X", "B00005JKWX", "B000CDSS18", "B0000YTP02", "B00006HAWN", "B00AEFZ63M", "6305133468", "B00AEFXOE0", "B009NNM9OA", "B000MNOX94", "B000PHVZNE", "B00AEFY17E", "B000G1R394", "B001QB5SS6", "B005OZVXCU", "B000FVR1T2", "B0000AM6NV", "B002YMWQ2M", "B002VWNICM", "B0023UZBBI", "B009YQJ2Q4", "B00005JMCN", "B0026JI1R2", "B0002TSZI8", "B000KF0GWW", "078324021X", "6305428387", "B0038M2AZA", "B008FCX2D2", "B000QQLVPQ", "0767836359", "0783225733", "B000X5RBXG", "B004SEUJOQ", "B00KD5HFJG", "B00AMEZDJW", "B00AEFXV3E", "B000RBA6C4", "B00AEFXY6I", "0767802497", "B000FFJYB6", "B000274T94", "B0000648ZR", "B00133KFGW"], "bought_together": ["B002VECM6S", "B000056VP4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000X5RBXG", "B000056VP4", "B000J3OTT6", "B00005JPBO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 13680}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "Team Marketing", "asin": "B00008EY60", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510370Y4VYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Radio"}

{"description": "Deep Space Nine's sixth season began ambitiously with a six-part story arc devoted to the Dominion War. This was a brave move in many ways, but a sensible one too. Whereas other sci-fi shows wouldn't commit to showing the impact of war (e.g.,Babylon 5), here there were numerous visible sacrifices. Characters were frequently kidnapped and held prisoner, allowing screen time for other members of the ever-growing cast (at its peak there were as many as 18 individuals with speaking roles per episode). This year also introduced the idea of Starfleet Intelligence and its sinister Section 31; alliances were built only to crumble almost immediately; Sisko led a suicide mission and at long last his destiny as the Emissary took a serious turn.Amid all thissturm und drangthe writers felt it necessary to inject some levity. In fact, there was so much comedic sidetracking this year it actually seemed as if they were afraid of the series' dark tone. Witness: Quark undergoing a temporary sex change, leading aMagnificent Seven-style band of Ferengi (with a cameo from Iggy Pop), Morn's nonspeaking character being sorely missed, the blend of Troi and Guinan into '60s crooner Vic Fontaine, and, in one fan favorite episode (\"Far Beyond the Stars\"), Sisko having visions of himself and the crew as 1950s staff writers on pulp magazineIncredible Tales.  There were also cute reconciliations among Worf's extended family (leading toTrek's first cast wedding), and even the revelation of Bashir's genetically enhanced origins quickly became a subject for easy jokes.Any of these events would have been satisfactorily cute if the war had ended and the show had moved on. But it confused the viewer when every so often the battle would be rejoined mid-episode. The clinching proof that no grand design was really at work was in the sudden exit of Dax. Despite all the jarring humor scattered about after the strong opening, the show seemed unable to avoid reverting to shock tactics for its finale. All of which hardly made the promised final year seem a particularly enticing prospect.--Paul Tonks", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008KA57", "B00008KA59", "B00008KGT0", "B00008KA5A", "B00008972H", "B00005JLF5", "B00062IDCO", "B00062IDLA", "B0002JP4GE", "B0002WZTCA", "B000127LW2", "B0001NBNFW", "B000228EBS", "B000AOEMXC", "B0009I7NGW", "B000A6CLL0", "B0007TKH66", "B00BHWG0CM", "B00BHWG0DQ", "B000063V8T", "B000063V8S", "B000063V8R", "B000062XFG", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B00062IDDS", "B00005Y1NF", "B002BAW6FE", "B00KYCA4QY", "B00000JZ0Z", "B002BAW6FY", "B002BAW6H2", "B00HETWFVC", "B000HEWEJ4", "B000VDDDY6", "B002BAW6GS", "B001DHXT3Y", "B002BAW6GI", "B000AOEMXM", "B00IURL19Y", "B004EXWGHY", "B00IWTVDUW", "B00IO998U2", "B00JX3SHIC", "B002I9Z8GW", "B00B7VZN76", "B0017VG69U", "145169590X", "B000LC4ZI0", "B00CDEJRDC", "B0041B77RS", "B00BD6K54G", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00AZMFJYA", "B002I9Z8EO", "B002I9Z8GM", "B00CKYHH6O", "B00FFEM0W2", "B000CEXFYW", "B003Y7JWZ0", "B001DHXT6G", "B0095XPZBC", "B000I0QLR8", "B006LPHY6G", "B0006UEVTA", "B00C6ACWLC", "B000I0QLRI", "B009VYF5E2", "B000B8IA2G", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B008R52LA2", "B000I0QLRS", "B000F8O2PQ", "B005PPMHO2", "B000BOH990", "B00BHLTIXQ", "B002GP7ZVO", "B003H9LIRK", "B001DF681G", "B00C6ACUF0", "B00GX7D5G0", "B0007UDCX0", "B00CYQXHLC", "B000FEBWTY", "B00BHWG1AI", "B00AMDA2P8", "6305181721", "B00IUR3YI0", "B004HYW84G", "B0055OG2BC", "B00ENFS0F0", "B000E5KQM8", "B000W4KT9G", "B00CTSDDVO", "B00466H3A4", "B000BOH98G", "B00453QOC6", "B000I0QLS2", "B000CNE0T2", "1451607156", "B000I0QLQY"], "bought_together": ["B00008KA57", "B00008KA59"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00008KA57", "B00008KA59", "B00008KA5A", "B00008KGT0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 20268}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 34.93, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B00008KA58", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51oKmE4qlyL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek Deep Space Nine - The Complete Sixth Season"}
{"description": "LongtimeLa Femme Nikitafans and newcomers alike will enjoy this six-disc boxed set, which compiles the syndicated television series' entire first season, and shows why it garnered a devoted audience throughout its five-season run (1997-2001): it's a fast-paced, action-packed mixture of sex appeal (thanks to the statuesque form of its star, Australian actress Peta Wilson) and intricately plotted espionage thrills. Producers Joel Surnow and Robert Cochran (who later created24) hewed the series' framework closely to its inspiration--Luc Besson's1990 theatrical featureof the same name--save for one change. Where the movie Nikita is a drug-addicted thug, Wilson's Nikita is a street-savvy homeless woman. The pilot, \"Nikita\" (on disc 1), details her introduction to the underground spy network known as Section One: facing a death sentence after a trumped-up murder charge, Nikita is approached by the mysterious Michael (Roy Dupuis), who offers her a new identity as an anti-terrorist operative. The subsequent 21 episodes in the set offer plenty of action and suspense, as well as a compelling character in Nikita, who struggles constantly with the deception and bloodshed that are unavoidable aspects of her assignments. The set concludes with a dramatic season finale, disc 6's \"Mercy,\" which forces Nikita to deal with some hard truths about her future and her feelings for Michael.If having the complete first season in one set doesn't please series fans, the supplemental features will surely satisfy even the iciest armchair operative. Disc 1 offers commentary by Surnow, Cochran, and director Jon Cassar on \"Nikita\" as well as commentary by Surnow for deleted scenes from several episodes (also on discs 2, 3, and 6); disc 6 features Surnow's comments on \"Mercy,\" as well as \"Section One Declassified: The Making ofLa Femme Nikita,\" which features interviews with the cast and creators.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0047BXR8U", "B0047BXR9E", "B000FFJYBQ", "B0047BXR30", "B003UD7JEE", "B006YG9HJE", "B00H57HOSC", "B005FISC3Y", "B001MVWRNE", "B0030VANIU", "B001MVWRNO", "B001MVWRMK", "B001GF8WP8", "B003UD7JEO", "B00008ZZ9E", "B001MVWRMU", "B006YGC7KK", "B001MVWRN4", "B00GTZWUPS", "B003R4ZMQI", "B00H57HQRG", "B002GHHHJC", "B000007Q6J", "B00170LCWC", "B00L1HTRGY", "B009LDCWIA", "B00B4804LM", "B000BKVKSA", "B00JF5GAZA", "B00CD45JBG", "B0079IEPHK", "B0055SNHQG", "B000MLWQ6S", "B0013DZNAA", "B00BD6KXKW", "B000E33VZY", "B00005JLEY", "B000TGURZ8", "B00HUCF7AO", "B00BVMXBDO", "B00006LPCK", "B005G172Q8", "B0081QF6Q8", "B000O77SMW", "B0009A407A", "B007PKSOJC", "B00BEJL6JK", "B001QUXNQG", "B001QE99BA", "B000O77SN6", "B000MLWQ6I", "B004YPED14", "B00CRX82LM", "B000EWBNMS", "B00IXPWGIS", "B0051GOB2G", "B000GGSLSG", "B000NOKFGW", "B00IYMSMTM", "B000OVLMKC", "B0006UEVTK", "B00HUPC5X8", "B000ILZ6F0", "B00HDFYUF6", "B0085KGH9U", "B002JVWR4U", "B003IMERF6", "B000E8JNRO", "B0001I55ZQ", "B007V4QKYI", "B002QZDSW4", "B0024FAR66", "B002ZHKZFQ", "B009LDD1H6", "B002BWP2IK", "B0012IXBNC", "B009AMAJBO", "B00DI013EG", "B001VG2ME4", "B00HUAGYF8", "B000E33VZO", "B00005JM67", "B00E3QJ7JC", "B001AQO43M", "B00005JNOG", "B0000AVHCD", "B003L77GWE", "B009T3AGK8", "B000ENC6QY", "B00FRQ0HOQ", "B00IO998U2", "B0010TDRP0", "B006WNMHYG", "B0012IX35S", "B000N3T0EG", "B008H1Q61G", "B00I4581F4", "B0011UBDS6", "B00AATGDUC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000GGSLSG", "B003UD7JEE", "B006YG9HJE", "B005FISC3Y"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 71497}, "asin": "B00008ZL4Q", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41LcRVnG5ML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "La Femme Nikita: Season 1"}

Another commentary track, in which the authors recall the making of the film and the material that was cut, lasts 17 minutes and is not related to the portion of the film it accompanies.  A pop-up \"fact track\" offers further background and production info, as does a 15-minute making-of featurette.  Eight of the African actors discuss their harrowing personal experiences in \"Voices of Africa,\" and eight deleted scenes wouldn't have added much to the film, other than introducing two small but important characters earlier.  The sound mix is particularly involving during the climactic scene.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000065U1N", "B00AEBBA36", "B0007KIFGE", "B00005JK8K", "B005LAIGYQ", "B004U7MQWY", "B00001ZWUS", "B0015D20FE", "B0000542CK", "079284646X", "B00AEFXVCU", "B00005PJ8T", "B00275EGWY", "B000MZHW40", "B00003CXHJ", "B00A34LX2M", "B00005JKTP", "B000DZIGDU", "B00AZNEW5G", "B00AEBB86A", "B000M4RG42", "B002GSXKNS", "B002ZG97RE", "B00HEPE6MM", "B00003CXTG", "B000Y7WGOW", "B00004XPPG", "B001KMB6XM", "B00562I40K", "0783226888", "B005OTGS4E", "B00AEBB86U", "B000ELL1R6", "6304765258", "0767807588", "1558908315", "6304698747", "B000BRP4BM", "B00000G3PA", "B00005JA9F", "B000P0J09C", "0792839730", "B00008K76U", "B00AEFXKUI", "B0007TKNGA", "B000EHSVSC", "B002O3Z510", "B00AEFY5B6", "B000MRA542", "B000OT6V0K", "B009HIKAN8", "B00005JN0W", "B000XT1P4S", "B001BP4K22", "B003ELKNH2", "B0000TANUI", "B002AS466O", "6304711891", "0767817745", "B00005OSJQ", "B00AEFYENK", "B00003CXGV", "B0045HCJFS", "B00005R87B", "B000N3SRO0", "B00006JDVV", "B00AG51V8E", "0790732238", "B00HEPC0TS", "B00DU22OI6", "B003ASLJOU", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B00005B6JZ", "B00AEFXPMG", "B004EPYZP8", "B00AEFXRRO", "B000QUCRB4", "B00003CXQA", "B005FITIDC", "B0062P3392", "B008E70EES", "B004O8LETK", "B000G0O5N2", "B002AT8KA6", "B004HO6HWA", "B00BLF9FOK", "B00005N5S3", "6305428115", "B000G6BL60", "B00005BCKF", "B002ZG96ZC", "B002VWNIEA", "B000AARKOO", "B006A8XFVC", "B00005JA8B", "B004LGGXG4", "B0009UVCQW", "B002MXG584", "B002OGMGV4", "B00BEIYHO2"], "bought_together": ["B000065U1N", "B00AEBBA36"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000065U1N", "B00AEBBA36", "B00HEPE6MM", "B005LAIGYQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23623}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.49, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000095WW8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51oFGrwDRDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Tears of the Sun (Special Edition)"}

There she encounters a reclusive climber (Louis Trenker) and a young skier (Ernst Peterson), who are each pursuing their own elusive ideals amid the intoxicating beauty and treacherous dangers of the Alps.

Anticipating the importance of animated training films, Disney produced the studio's first educational film, \"Four Methods of Flush Riveting\" (1941), using limited animation to train riveters at Lockheed. Decades later, \"Four Methods\" and the excerpts from military training films remain models of how to present information clearly and concisely.Many of the wartime entertainment shorts are largely propaganda. Donald's nightmare of working on a Nazi assembly line in \"Der Fuehrer's Face\" is still hilarious slapstick. The grimmer \"Education for Death\" and \"Chicken Little\" have aged less gracefully. Disney's oddest wartime project wasVictory Through Air Power(1943), a live action/animation feature based on Major Alex de Seversky's controversial book that called for the adoption of long-range bombers. By the time it was finished, air power was a reality.Front Linesalso includes several health films made for the Office of Inter-American Affairs, and bond-buying shorts for Canada that reuse animation fromSnow Whiteand \"Three Little Pigs.\" This collection of genuine rarities is a must-have for anyone interested in the history of animation, the Disney Studio, or America during WWII.

{"description": "A northern Spanish coastal town suffers from its own isolationism as shipyards close down, leaving the labor force scouring the streets for temp jobs with only their stubborn pride to show for it. Among the disillusioned is Santa (Javier Bardem), a cocksure, angry rebel who refuses to admit his own failures. Santa is the ring leader of a group of rapidly aging friends whose unemployed status causes them mounting grief. They drown their sorrows in an otherwise empty bar owned by Rico (Joaquin Climent), one of their coworkers from what now seems another life. While Santa tries to clumsily seduce women and pay for a lamp post he vandalized in anger, his companions battle serious alcoholism, loan denials, and marriage troubles, as they all face their own insignificance.Javier Bardem perfectly embodies the defiant loser that is Santa. Letting himself go and carrying a hefty gut, Bardem manages to exude the false charm of a bitter sad sack who has remained a lady's man. Captured in gritty detail, director Fernando Leon de Aranoa offers a shattered image of the proud work force of northern Spain in a picture that won five Goya Awards, Spain's equivalent to the Oscars.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0011FLH14", "B00003CXRG", "B00080Z53O", "B00116GEJ8", "B0041KKYF6", "B0000AGQ5V", "B00005JNCZ", "B001DJ7PR8", "B004MOJW0E", "B000088UZ4", "B00005N8A9", "B00HOGBXS6", "B002VECLXC", "B000LXHFMW", "B0002TT0MI", "B00005JLQW", "B008S2NABI", "B00FRILRW0", "B00005JL57", "B002M2T1V8", "B0000C9JFO", "B0041KKYFG", "B000Y54UUC", "B000N3T0DW", "B00HRJVHEK", "B001S400C0", "B002BWP3UC", "B0042816YK", "B001OXLGJQ", "B009GIGY3E", "B004XVMCMG", "B006C1S1DY", "B00006G8G3", "B00H9HZITU", "B00AZMFKXK", "B0036TGSJE", "B0019K4YT8", "B00FXWAZX2", "B002M2T1VI", "B00005421W", "B006HAJAGM", "B000O76ZQC", "6305132917", "B0007OCG5G", "B00005LZOD", "B00000F7E6", "B00009MEJ6", "B00023P4N8", "B002AK7SB2", "B000Q7ZLRY", "B000E1YVZK", "B00ATK02FO", "B0006GANN2", "B000083C5F", "B008LC8V1Y", "B0019UGYAU", "B000OVLBGC", "B008220DGE", "B00005AAF5", "B0041KXT26", "B00195FUFA", "B000N2HDH8"], "bought_together": ["B0011FLH14"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CXRG", "B0000AGQ5V", "B0011FLH14", "B00116GEJ8"]}, "price": 9.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 335212}, "asin": "B0000CBXZ3", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511PG5GYMBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mondays in the Sun"}

{"description": "Directed by a prince and financed by a queen,The Legend of Suriyothaiis a sprawling Thai epic in the tradition of Hollywood's biblical extravaganzas of the 1950s. A former film student-turned-prince of Thailand, director and co-writer Chatrichalerm Yukol recruited film-school classmate Francis Ford Coppola to shape this ambitious production (originally over three hours long) into a 142-minute \"Reader's Digest\" version for an international audience, and the result is a mixed blessing: There's more pomp, circumstance, and pageantry in this historical saga than you'd find in a half-dozen lesser films, with bloody battles, assassinations, beheadings, parades of elephants, and jaw-dropping sets and costumes galore, and the attention to physical detail is astonishing. It's also a narrative mess, spanning two decades in the 16th-century story of Suriyothai, princess of Ayuthaya (now Thailand), where two kingdoms are quarreling while war with Burma (to the north) is about to erupt. Palace intrigue, lavish ritual, and traitorous deception abound, unfolding at a deliberate pace that will either test your patience or command your attention.

{"description": "Opening with a Dido theme song and featuring character-driven, sweet-natured melodrama,Roswellwas a show with a surprisingly dedicated fandom, who twice won it reprieve from cancellation. One of its main strengths was, of course, the extent to which its premise--alien teenagers trying to sort out their identities while emotionally involved with their human contemporaries--was a free-floating metaphor for race and sexuality issues. Another was the strong ensemble that its cast developed: you believed in the strangeness of the alien trio and the  well-intentioned normality of their three human  friends. Jason Behr gave the alien Max a quiet authority and Majendra Delfino took the sidekick role of Maria and gave it both intensity and fine comic timing. It was also a show in which you were never sure which adults you could trust--William Sadleir trod a fine line of ambiguity as the local sheriff and Julie Benz was silkily sinister as an FBI agent. Anyone who ever loved this show will want these DVDs--and many others may want to find out what the fuss was about.Roswellis presented in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen. The special features include commentaries on six episodes by writer Jason Katims, the directors, and various cast members as well as a featurette on the making of the show and another on its adaptation from the originalRoswell Highseries of young adult novels. The commentaries are unusually insightful on the casting process, and the discs also include the auditions for the part of Tess as well as a deleted scene and a music video.--Roz Kaveney", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00133QNS6", "B00133QNSG", "B000NOKFGW", "B00005YU87", "B001ILFUB4", "B002QZDSW4", "B000O77SMW", "B0002XVKMM", "B000O77SN6", "B000FJH5M2", "B00008AOX3", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B000EHSVKK", "B000092T3Y", "B0000E5NPY", "B00177YA10", "B000AO9BSS", "B00JF5G8WU", "B0002234R2", "B0001907BC", "B000VSDNFA", "B0009A407A", "B0077PTWY6", "B003R0MF6W", "B002BWP2IK", "B00022FWEU", "B000F3UAE8", "B0001IN0T4", "B000FOPPBA", "B001CQONMC", "B0001I55S8", "B0051GOB2G", "B0077PTWHI", "B000YDOOEQ", "B00IWTVDUW", "B00GHH9IAI", "B0009JE6G6", "B000I0QLQY", "B000EAT23C", "B00HQOFAKI", "B000BOH990", "B001MVWRNO", "B002JVWR4U", "B0007V6IW6", "B000I0QLR8", "B002HMTX84", "B00HUPC5X8", "B000BNXD6O", "B00GHH9HBI", "B008X6N8KW", "B0009JE6FC", "B0002RQ3MK", "0671774654", "B001MVWRNE", "B004YPED14", "B003L77GWE", "B0024FAR66", "B0024FAD9C", "B00DPJEWD4", "B00BD6K54G", "B001MVWRMU", "B002CLKP00", "B009LDCWWG", "B000I0QLRI", "B008JFUS0U", "B00JF5GAZA", "B0006J28DW", "0671774662", "B000K7UBX4", "B00BGQ2NIO", "B00005JM39", "B004SMDJ9U", "B000BOH98G", "B0058YPGL6", "B00465I156", "B00127RAGM", "0671774646", "B00BGI086Q", "B00J11U54K", "B006LG74Q0", "B000OCXNQW", "B00GOC74I4", "B001MVWRMK", "B001AQO43M", "B005PPMHO2", "B00466H3CC", "B000EHSVMS", "B000J10KKA", "B000QDLSR0", "B000FIHN8O", "B0012IXBNC", "B00FUABG1C", "B001MVWRN4", "B00166UFTI", "B0011FLGZQ", "B000I0QLS2", "B00005JO9J", "B00ED2IBXE", "B0001JXPPC", "B00AALVINW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00133QNSG", "B000NOKFGW", "B00133QNS6", "B001ILFUB4"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 106839}, "asin": "B0000TPA6K", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TBGR80E9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Roswell - The Complete First Season"}
{"description": "Who knew Luke Skywalker was such a geek? As the director-coproducer-star ofComic Book: The Movie,Star Warsveteran Mark Hamill embraces his inner nerd and pays affectionate tribute to those who are attracted (either casually or obsessively) to the fantastical realms of comic books. As \"Don Swan,\" high school teacher, lifelong comic collector, and microbudget filmmaker, Hamill joins legions of fans at San Diego's epic-scale ComiCon International (the world's largest sci-fi/comic convention), on a mission to thwart a dubious Hollywood makeover of Captain Courage, his favorite \"Golden Age\" comic superhero. Hamill's experiment in \"mockumentary\" is unscripted, haphazard, not very funny, and a bit too \"inside\" for mass appeal, but its spontaneous spirit hides a worthy agenda that any fan can relate to: While exploring the lively atmosphere of ultimate fandom,Comic Book: The Movieinvestigates the schism between Hollywood and fandom that results, too often, in lackluster big-screen adventures for beloved comic-book characters. By recruiting a cast of prominent cartoon-voice talent (like himself), in addition to an all-star list of comic-artist cameos including Stan Lee, Matt Groening, and many others, Hamill has crafted a casual yet thoroughly researched portrait of one of America's most vibrant subcultures. The abundant bonus features are arguably better than the feature itself, most notably the extended interviews with Stan Lee, Hugh Hefner, Kevin Smith, and B-movie king Bruce Campbell, all of whom (like Hamill) have played influential roles in the fandom they celebrate.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006AUJG", "B00IYXNP84", "B000Y5CJNC", "B00006672S", "B000KJU16E", "B002PQ7JQK", "B001CQONOA", "B0040YFR1Y", "B000MCH5RM", "B0049IHWYG", "B004EXWGJW", "B00J4BW14O", "6305428263", "B00EE8AJ50", "B008MZZCZI", "B0028ZDJF8", "B002LMSWN2", "B00HXEWECI"], "bought_together": ["B00006AUJG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00006672S"]}, "price": 7.97, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 290565}, "asin": "B0000V47B2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C92ZCFFPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Comic Book - The Movie"}
{"description": "From the studio that brought you SWEET HOME ALABAMA comes the extraordinary romantic comedy starring Academy Award(R) nominee Diane Lane (2002 Best Actress, UNFAITHFUL). Based on the #1 New York Times best-selling book, UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN follows San Francisco writer Frances Mayes (Lane) to Italy as a good friend offers her a special gift -- 10 days in Tuscany. Once there, she is captivated by its beauty and warmth, and impulsively buys an aging, but very charming, villa. Fully embracing new friends and local color, she finds herself immersed in a life-changing adventure filled with enough unexpected surprises, laughter, friendship, and romance to restore her new home -- and her belief in second chances.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0042816YK", "B004SIP6BI", "B002ZG988M", "B000LXHK2C", "B000MQC9H4", "B000BNX3B4", "B0017ANB08", "B00005JPSM", "B00006ZXSI", "B0038N9WKU", "B0000CE684", "0767900383", "B002RSDW80", "B000C8STWQ", "B00008G7UF", "B0001I55M4", "B000YDBPAM", "B003B3V0W0", "B0001AVZA8", "B0009OL7Z4", "B000023VTP", "630560097X", "B005S9EJ14", "B001LPWGBY", "B004SIP9RO", "B000EHRVOW", "B00006FMUW", "B004SIP8LG", "B00008NRI7", "B000CCBCAS", "0307885283", "B003ASLJK4", "B00006ZXSO", "B00EEW1D2Y", "B004SIP7D0", "B000HEWEE4", "B00AEBB8YW", "B0002B15Y2", "B00AMEZDK6", "B0000AOV4I", "B0021L8UO4", "B001DB6J6Y", "B00AEBB8SS", "B000J103OI", "B003B3V0N4", "B00AEFXYOA", "B00081U7HC", "B00005JG6N", "B009NOF57C", "B00EIBO8T6", "B003BV8ICC", "B00007E2F5", "B000OCZA04", "B00EZC8042", "0783240171", "B0071HPOGK", "B0038N9X3Q", "B004XVMCMG", "B000JYW5EQ", "B0007TKOAA", "B003PIUIJC", "B004DK5CW4", "6304765266", "B0000524E5", "B0021L8UZS", "B00C888MJ8", "B002NZK5TQ", "B004EPYZP8", "B00003CXSM", "B0045HCJJ4", "B00E7YMTB8", "B001AKTZW8", "B002ZG989G", "B0017ANAZO", "B000XJD33O", "B000053VB4", "B000085OY1", "B00000JGHK", "6305212112", "B000ELJAEM", "B000EMGICS", "B001QYOY3S", "B0013D8LHC", "B00D7HBV10", "B002K0WBXW", "B005MYEQ4U", "B0030BOCFU", "B000E1ZBGS", "B001TUZD8O", "B00003CXXG", "B002NZK5V4", "B0050MB584", "B00006ZXSQ", "B002ZG99UE", "B00319ECB0", "B000CCW2P2", "B00006RCNY", "B0006U5UT0", "B004UXUX4Q"], "bought_together": ["B0042816YK", "B002ZG988M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0042816YK", "B002ZG988M", "B000LXHK2C", "B00008G7UF"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3338}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.62, "brand": "Touchstone Video", "asin": "B0000VD02Y", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VTXVEM36L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Under the Tuscan Sun (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Good news, everyone, the third DVD volume ofFuturamais just as funny as ever--irreverent, boundlessly inventive, warmhearted, and chock-full of in-jokes, sight gags, and fleeting references to all manner of pop-culture icons and obscure genre classics. In fact, if the show has a problem, it's that it's all so lovingly crafted that scarcely a frame goes by without something both funny and clever going on: when a horse wins a race by a quantum fraction, Prof. Farnsworth fulminates, \"You changed the result by observing it!\" Recurring minor characters (Elzar the chef, the robot mafia, the mutants in the sewers) pop up unexpectedly throughout, providing another wink to dedicated fans; likeRed Dwarf, this is a show that loves the genre it sets out to spoof. Shame, then, that the show has had a troubled broadcast history and never quite found the mainstream appeal of its stablemateThe Simpsons.Fry and thePlanet Expressteam find themselves stranded on a planet of unfeasibly large women (\"Amazon Women in the Mood\"), standing in for psychotic Robo-Santa (\"A Tale of Two Santas\", with John Goodman reprising his evil robot), and variously falling in love with each other and sundry other humans, aliens, man-bots, fem-bots, virtual reality constructs, and even thePlanet Expressship itself.Futurama, Vol. 3comprises 22 episodes on four discs. As with previous DVD sets, the animated menus are a treat, and there's a selection of bonus features including deleted scenes, storyboards, commentaries on every episode, animatics, \"How to draw\" tips, and more.

{"description": "It sounds likeLove Story, but with an intriguing twist. 23-year-old wife and mom Sarah Polley has spent her entire life sacrificing for others and living on the economic fringe; when she discovers she has only a few months to live, she resolves to keep the news secret. In her remaining time, she plots a course for various unfinished plans and deferred dreams:  write a journal, leave future messages for her kids, make a stranger (Mark Ruffalo) fall in love with her. Obviously, the danger of sentimentality lurks in director Isabel Coixet's concept, and the film does have a few soggy moments. Some critics lost patience with the main character's seeming selfishness (a good post-movie conversation starter). Yet there is something powerful in her insistence on claiming a small piece of existence exclusively for herself. Polley (Guinevere) gives a typically honest performance, with fine support by Scott Speedman and Deborah Harry.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000NJWIPI", "B000066JBR", "B000T5O48A", "B00005MKKV", "B008NA3I30", "B001QERPAC", "B0000844LU", "B00FXWAZW8", "B0002IQE2I", "0780622251", "B004QL7KKC", "B00AEFXESQ", "0767835093", "B00005T30L", "B004A8ZWV0", "B00000F7E6", "B00AKGG6JS", "B002K2KMJA", "B00DEKKEPO", "B0051GLDVS", "B00H9HZITU", "B0036TGSJE", "B00E8G5GU6", "B00003CWTI", "B00BLN4UDS", "B009AJB0YM", "B002AS463W", "B00005YUPC", "0767802519", "B001OQCV1K", "B006KH6CF4", "B0014D5RBE", "B004SIP6GI", "B00FRILRYS", "0800141806", "B003NKU9AK"], "bought_together": ["B000NJWIPI", "B000066JBR"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00A81MV3U", "B000NJWIPI", "B0000ZMGWK", "B00009MEJ6"]}, "price": 9.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 89272}, "asin": "B00013WWSY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WK3YG5EFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "My Life Without Me"}

{"description": "John Wayne and Anthony Quinn star in this touching 1945 drama inspired by real-life heroism in the Philippines following General MacArthur's withdrawal in 1942 and the islands' subsequent conquest by the Japanese army. Wayne plays Colonel Joe Madden, an American who stays behind to organize a ragtag guerrilla army in the forests and hills. At his side is Captain Andres Bonifacio (Quinn), grandson of a legendary revolutionary martyred in the nation's old war against Spanish colonialists. Joe, Andres, and their fearless irregulars (with support from a schoolteacher, played by Beulah Bondi) sap the enemy's resolve through hit-and-run missions, but as time passes the locals wonder, with pronounced disillusionment, why America doesn't return with masses of troops and weapons. Wayne's star power is undeniable, and Quinn is very good as a man uncertain of his role or destiny. Edward Dmytryk (Murder, My Sweet), soon to be imprisoned during Joseph McCarthy's witch hunt of Hollywood communists, directs.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004GSVXBW", "B000O599N0", "B0036BDQ7E", "B000U1ZV6M", "B000O599Z8", "B001PO556E", "B00AEFYBA6", "B000O599VC", "B00BY0EBK0", "B000BPL2FG", "B000ASDFHC", "B0007TKNGA", "B0005C9MQ6", "B00BFWKE62", "B00005N5S3", "B0009ML2JC", "0782010040", "B0014CCPP6", "B000NTPG6Q", "B005DTZXPA", "B000O599NK", "B000HT38BW", "B000O599LW", "B000O599ZI", "B000O599NA", "B00005PJ8K", "B008A1TXMM", "0783230478", "B00005PJ8S", "B000O599XU", "B001PO54OM", "0783228031", "B000O599VM", "B00AEFXSVE", "B0015S2OWI", "B0001FVDX2", "B0047BXR94", "B0009ML2KQ", "B006PA19VS", "B004DY1VIO", "B005DTZXL4", "B00096S4BM", "B0001WTWWE", "B0001NBMH6", "B000O599YE", "B000O59A0C", "B00008AOTO", "B000O599YO", "0782011276", "B000059TFU", "B000ANVPP6", "B000O599YY", "B000O599W6", "B00AEFXUL2", "B0002V8OAK", "B000EHSVSC", "B0001NBMGC", "B00C3ALLPS", "B00005JN9P", "B00096S4B2", "B000E5N6KW", "B000EQHXMI", "B000A2WJBQ", "B00AMDA2OY", "B00AEBBA0E", "B00BGQ2P9G", "B000FZETR0", "B005AMJ3CE", "B000EMGJFE", "B0082LUFA4", "B00008AOTR", "B00008MTW5", "B00008CMR4", "B00AEFY6ZQ", "B000O78L0U", "B00E4DJK78", "B00CFHEE08", "B000O599X0", "B00008MTW7", "B000O179JK", "B007FQXEQO", "B00006L92Y", "B000O599MG", "B004GSVX8A", "B00008CMR6", "0792841662", "B000EHSVS2", "B0007TKNLU", "B00AEFXLKC", "6304696612", "B00C3ALKYK", "B00005R23T", "B0002TSZHY", "B00C6QYMJG", "B000O599Y4", "B000H1RFSM", "B00BQ412J2", "B0015TJBXW", "B000O599NU", "B000062XEX"], "bought_together": ["B004GSVXBW", "B000U1ZV6M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000U1ZV6M", "B00AEFYBA6", "B00BY0EBK0", "B004GSVXBW"]}, "price": 6.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 342909}, "asin": "B0001FVE4A", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51wM136bE4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Back to Bataan"}
{"description": "Somebody smart produced the director's commentary track forBig  Fish; they brought in an interviewer to keep Tim Burton on track, thus  avoiding those moments when a director gapes silently at his movie,  grasping for some fresh thought. This sense of control, however, fosters a  somewhat corporate atmosphere, which also infests the typically fatuous  featurettes about \"The Character's Journey\" and \"The Filmmakers' Path.\"  Which is not to say they're a waste: Ewan McGregor is simply the most  charming man in the world; the various beasties in the movie are  technically interesting; and there's an interesting bit about the author  of the book and the screenwriter, usually two of the most ignored figures  in cinema.

However as a post-movie experience, the top-line extras with Cruise and director Edward Zwick are repetitive and underwhelming, with too many clips from the film we assume DVD viewers have just seen. The History Channel show is also a pre-release promotional device that misses an opportunity to really dig into this intriguing time period. Better are segments on the costumes, the production design, and how you put together an Imperial army--in New Zealand, no less. Zwick's low-key and dense commentary (plus a \"Video Journal\") is not vital, but he illustrates many of the little peculiarities it took to make the wide-ranging film come together. There are two deleted scenes; a samurai's first appearance is particularly memorable.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFY5B6", "B002O3Z50Q", "B00004XPPG", "B00AMSLDTM", "B0002YLCG0", "B0000DZTIW", "B000AARKOO", "B000QXDED6", "B003U0AHBO", "B00AEFXKUI", "B000A2WP7O", "B008MIMWOY", "B00AEBBA36", "B004AOECXI", "6305692688", "B000MGB6NM", "B0000TANUI", "079283366X", "B00005JL78", "B000W1SZBS", "B004SIP88Y", "B0034G4P58", "B001TUZG4K", "B00AS1Q93S", "B000MRA592", "B00001ZWUS", "B000E5N6LG", "B000XR9L50", "B0001HLVS2", "B00HEPDGKA", "B003ASLJO0", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000P0J0EW", "B0000A2ZNX", "B00005JNTI", "B0018QPPXW", "B000065U1N", "B000095WW8", "B0002WZTOI", "B002VWNIEA", "B004U7MQWY", "B002VWNID6", "B008JFUO36", "B00AEBB86A", "B00005JN0W", "B0007Q6VXC", "B001LRJH0U", "B000MZHW40", "B0002IQMAM", "B00004WG2F", "B003INBO3I", "B000EHRVMY", "B000NOKFHQ", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEFXVCU", "B000YENUI6", "B000M341QE", "B0000YEEGM", "B001680M26", "B008R65XYC", "B002ZG99QS", "B00008K76U", "B000HRMAPE", "B007TBKAXK", "B00000G3PA", "0767810856", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00AEFXYJA", "B002T9H2LA", "B000P0J0AG", "B00003CXZ1", "B000O599YO", "B000FS9FCG", "6304711905", "B00AEFXRRO", "B000HRMAUY", "B001ILHY1I", "B002NZK5V4", "B002VWNICC", "B000VKL6ZM", "B001UDS4BS", "B002ZG997C", "B004SIP8ZM", "0800177967", "B0001O3YD0", "B00005ATZT", "B004XFZ3UU", "B00004Z4WR", "B005LAIH2W", "B0007TKNGA", "B00000JQB5", "B0012Q732O", "B002ZG97RE", "B0002VEUV2", "0800141741", "B002ZG977Y", "B00005N5S3", "B00008G8M4", "B0000B1OFL"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFY5B6", "B00004XPPG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000QXDED6", "B00BEJL6JK", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00JU949TK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 121880}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 17.25, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001JXOUS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EdSWs9r9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Last Samurai (Full Screen Edition)"}

{"description": "Some boxed sets claim to be definitive, but are haphazardly selected. Not this one. Four of the five titles here can legitimately lay claim to being essentials in the film noir canon, and the fifth,The Set-Up, is a terrific boxing picture with a strong noir atmosphere. If you're a fan of noir--or have no idea what it's all about--this collection is a treat.Of course, none of these movies were made as \"film noir.\" The term was coined later by French critics to describe the moody, anxious feel of postwar American movies, especially the genre that highlighted duplicitous dames and susceptible men lost in the criminal jungle. Indeed, the titleThe Asphalt Jungleconveys the edgy urban arena of these pictures. That film is John Huston's masterly 1950 account of a heist, with Sterling Hayden the disenchanted, noirish hero. Joseph H. Lewis'sGun Crazy(1949) is one of the most supercharged (and sexually perverse) of noir films, with John Dall and Peggy Cummins as young criminals in love.Murder, My Sweet(1944) is a straight adaptation of Raymond Chandler's novelFarewell, My Lovely. Amid the film's shadowy chiaroscuro, former musical comedy star Dick Powell makes a career-changing transition as Chandler's private dick, Philip Marlowe.Out of the Pastputs Robert Mitchum (perhaps the quintessential noir actor) in trouble with gangster Kirk Douglas, complicated by classic femme fatale Jane Greer. Jacques Tourneur provides the evocative direction. AndThe Set-Upplays out an ingenious boxing tale in \"real time,\" superbly enacted by (former boxer) Robert Ryan.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FI9OCW", "B003G9IT3C", "B0024FAG80", "B000PKG7DE", "B0024FAG8A", "B00097DY20", "B000B8384Q", "B00005RDRL", "B0007TKNKQ", "B002YNQEFG", "B00023P4GA", "B00005AUK9", "B0007ZEO8C", "B0087ZG7OI", "B002YNQEF6", "B000CNE088", "B000BQ5IXW", "B00023P4II", "B0007ZEO7S", "B003B3V0RA", "B00114XLTQ", "B00004XPPK", "B001CC7PM6", "B00007ELDG", "B00114XLUA", "B00004W229", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B000EXDSBQ", "6305999872", "B000087F79", "B000RXVND8", "B000PKG7CU", "B004C2523M", "B000LN6UHI", "B00012L786", "B000EXDSBG", "B002945DUM", "B0024FAG6W", "B0006Z2NS6", "B000B83846", "B000I2JDF8", "B001ASQ9OC", "B000GRUQJW", "B009X919UE", "B00004W19C", "B001QFFBAM", "B00008LDNZ", "B0009X7678", "B000BGH2NG", "B00I3C1T34", "B00D09AXUA", "B00457ZNS8", "B000FMGTQC", "B001CC7PLW", "B001OSC4G0", "B005152C9G", "B00023P4FQ", "B000KJTGFG", "B000YRY7VC", "B00006II5J", "B000B8380A", "B00114XLUU", "B008BSM1CI", "B000FFJYA2", "B00K6D1S7A", "B000A0GOEQ", "B00CVB6XF2", "B00ICWO1LC", "B000M2E3GI", "B00DBE97S8", "B0006HBV3C", "B000FKO3VM", "B0010KHOSA", "B0011FDVEK", "B00AEBBA7W", "B0006Z2NE0", "B0006UEVVS", "B000GIXLUW", "B0010KHOSU", "B0007TKNHY", "B0009X7682", "B000JLTRGI", "B006GVNHMA", "B000CNE08I", "0312180764", "1590201442", "B00AEFXN9G", "B0026ZQJP2", "B00AF4OTM6", "B00097DY0M", "B0000694WH", "0879101970", "B00C3ALM02", "B00EL6A7XE", "B008K1PXIK", "B000UJCAK4", "B00005AUKD", "B005H8G78O", "B00KIZY3XW"], "bought_together": ["B000FI9OCW", "B003G9IT3C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000244EYW", "B0024FAG80", "B000244EX8", "B000244EWO"]}, "price": 34.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15607}, "asin": "B000244F2S", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51LSoFvy1uL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Film Noir Classic Collection, Vol. 1 (The Asphalt Jungle / Gun Crazy / Murder My Sweet / Out of the Past / The Set-Up)"}

(the name also served as the film's alternate title) as a tortured vehicle for Scorsese's own inner conflict between rigid Catholic tradition and initial forays into liberating sexual experience. Produced over a lengthy on-and-off schedule while Scorsese was a struggling New York University film student, and shot in the Little Italy neighborhoods where Scorsese was raised, the film (with a final budget of $75,000) is a boldly stylized, stream-of-consciousness experience, establishing Scorsese's passion for well-chosen rock & roll soundtrack songs while plumbing the depths of J.R.'s soul as he begins a tenuous relationship with an independent, sexually experienced young woman (Zina Bethune) who's at odds with J.R.'s seething repression. Incorporating fantasy sequences to further convey the young man's turbulent thoughts and emotions,Who's That Knocking at My Doorearned favorable reviews, announcing the arrival of a bracing new talent and setting the stage, five years later, for the breakout triumph ofMean Streets.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000286RP2", "B000286RO8", "B000286RNE", "B00006RCNV", "B00005UM2Y", "B00BTYMPX6", "B000WC39ZY", "B007NQSQT6", "B006TTC5MM", "B004499LWG", "6305090580", "B000A2UBN4", "B000035Z5G", "B004VJJF34", "B00I4X8KU2", "B00006FDBU", "B001JQTSG6", "B001EIOOV8", "B004SEUJ7S", "0571220029", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00K0MM4AM", "B00GBT62PQ", "B0006GAOJA", "B000UJ48SQ", "B000C20VPA", "B00IGK6TGU", "0767830555", "B00J2PQYG8", "B00F98FOI6", "6305941122", "B001GS7AZS", "B00GPPXP6A", "B006ML50R4", "B00GMV8KGW", "B004IFYMYI", "B00008K7AO", "B0057UA486", "B0033AI4CK", "B005KQVE1S", "B00012L77W", "B0028OH568", "B00AEFY9RG", "B00FGVRZOM", "B00HE011DE", "B005CA4SL0", "B004SIP7US", "B00GGAK0FS", "B0016OM3TU", "B00HE010LC", "B000FFJYA2", "B000I2J736", "B000N4SHNK", "B00HT2RTU6", "0792841387", "B000P0J0D8", "B00GBT637S", "B001FOK70S", "B00168IWU0", "B000I8OMEY", "B00FMDL4UK", "0783229623", "B001EKP5D2", "B000VZGK3K", "B009L147EE", "B00GBT62N8", "B00AG472DS", "B000B83846", "B00GA9F2PI", "B008220DIC", "B00028HBIE", "0792841409", "B0006SSQSY", "B00H9KKKAY", "B00GPPXNQ2", "B005FXXTC8", "B000XJD34S", "B0024FAG2Q", "B0041LULM6", "B002U6DVQ2", "B001QFYCZM", "B0007US7EY", "B00AEBBA68", "B0024EWP6W", "B00GST8UB8", "B000EBD9RG", "B001P829VY", "B00000F3CD", "B000UJ48VI", "B000P0J09M", "B00005QAPH", "B00F98FOFY", "B005152C9G", "B003UESJJC", "B000063JDE", "B005E7SFEW", "B0002DB52M", "B00008RV1F", "B000CNESTE", "B000069HZO"], "bought_together": ["B000286RO8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000286RP2", "B000286RNE", "0767830555", "B0006GAOJA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 179589}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.72, "brand": "Warner", "asin": "B000286RPM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51M3YEW2FJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Who's That Knocking at My Door?

{"description": "The firstInu-Yashatheatrical feature plays like an extended episode of the popular television series. Kagome, Inu-Yasha, Shippo, Miroku, and Sango are pitted not against Naraku, but against the moth-demon Menomaru, who was awakened by a falling shard from the enchanted Shikon Jewel. Menomaru seeks to recapture the power of his father Hyoga, who was defeated by Inu-Yasha's father when Hyoga came to Japan \"from the continent\" (i.e., during the Mongol invasion of 1274). Only the combined power of Kagome's arrows and Inu-Yasha's sword Tetsusaiga can defeat this mighty demon.Affections Touching Across Timeis unusually handsome for a feature based on a broadcast series: When snow falls on Kagome's 20th-century home, the designers evoke the prints of Kawase Hasui.

{"description": "Now here is a movie that's practically perfect for DVD. Shot over many years with eccentric actors, Jim Jarmusch's collection of black-and-white vignettes is as uneven as a collection of music videos (without songs). Even with the dull spots and the drop-dead-hip ambiance, there's something touching about this parade of frazzled people holding on to their coffee and cigarettes like life rafts--especially in the final sequence with Taylor Mead. There are some severely misconceived pieces, but the best are a treat:  Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan in a hilarious Hollywood encounter, Tom Waits and Iggy Pop getting off on the wrong foot in a funky diner, and Cate Blanchett doing a dual role as herself and a jealous cousin. Bill Murray can't save one underwritten piece, but Jack and Meg White are amusing in an absurdist blackout.

{"description": "Tom Selleck gives a restrained yet powerful performance as General Dwight D. Eisenhower inIke: Countdown to D-Day. This made-for-cable feature focuses on the solemn, brilliant but plain-speaking Ike as he fine-tunes, over 90 days, tactical and political concerns involved with the Allies' imminent D-Day invasion of Normandy, i.e., America and Britain's long-awaited joint assault against Nazi-occupied Europe. A strong cast--James Remar as General Omar Bradley, Timothy Bottoms as Ike's assistant, Walter Bedell \"Beetle\" Smith--anchors the film's mesmerizing, blow-by-blow account of Eisenhower's leadership under the shadow of many uncertainties (predicting the weather for D-Day becomes a suspenseful refrain) and pressure from conflicting egos (Montgomery, DeGaulle, Patton). Ian Mune is a delight as a wary, darkly bemused Churchill, who encourages Ike's strategy of supreme leadership and low-key diplomacy. The script by Lionel Chetwynd (DC 9/11: Time of Crisis) captures the unbearable tension of commencing the invasion--and awaiting the results.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005N5S2", "B000KJTG0G", "B002CWKTUA", "B00CLH08KC", "B0000YEE58", "B000EHSVS2", "B002AMUDJY", "B0088FS286", "B000SK5Z7A", "B00005N5S3", "B0002S94C0", "B00DDY45DI", "B00005PJ8S", "B00A0KBE8M", "B0007TKNGA", "B000EHSVSC", "B00IJZW4HK", "B00CLH0C1M", "B00AEFYBA6", "B000O78L0U", "B00744WZ6W", "B00008AOTR", "B000BITVBA", "B00008AOTO", "B00005B6OY", "B0001WTUKS", "B000A2WJBQ", "B003B3NV5E", "B0001NBMH6", "B00007GZYC", "B00096S4B2", "B00005JXI7", "B00004Z4ST", "B002LII6PU", "B000NTPG6Q", "B00CZB9BE8", "B000BITUWK", "B0001NBNGQ", "B000E5N6KW", "B00005J760", "B00004TX5G", "B00005OSJQ", "B0007WFUNI", "B00008PC0Y", "B008NNY8IG", "B00005U8F4", "B0007TKNLU", "B000TLTCPO", "B000EOTUSK", "B00C2535TE", "B001B187MU", "B000MGTQ7K", "B0001US6CI", "0792841662", "B00319ECI8", "B000H1RFSM", "B00DL48BM6", "B00005ASGB", "B0001WTWWE", "B003AWRMCO", "6305161984", "B005DTZXPA", "B008XJM7T2", "B00CYQXE10", "B00BWJQEFS", "B004IFYMXO", "0060756667", "B000EOTUSA", "B00441GYYC", "B009A87ZKG", "B00005B1YF", "B003DYFYFQ", "B00108FMFO", "B001OLP2T8", "B001BSBC16", "B00096S4AS", "B0007OY2OE", "B00096S4BM", "B00BTYOYK8", "B000U1ZV6M", "B0001NBMGC", "B004TPJN3C", "B0083H6APG", "B00CVB6UXW", "B002ID09BM", "B00005JMLR", "B0006B2A42", "B00005LOL0", "B00009AOAW", "B0005C9MQ6", "B000ASDFHC"], "bought_together": ["B00005N5S2", "B000EHSVS2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005N5S2", "B002CWKTUA", "B000KJTG0G", "B00005N5S3"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 11955}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.95, "brand": "MOVIE", "asin": "B0002I833Q", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511Bm9emVDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ike - Countdown to D-Day"}

The two homicidal grifters perversely turn the tables on a corrupt system of unregulated mines and negligent owners by befriending fellow minders, murdering them in staged \"accidents,\" then passing their victims off as relatives in order to pocket their employer's hush money. But Tang and Song's ironic crime wave threatens to self-destruct after they recruit Feng, a naive young farm boy. Though merely fresh meat to Tang, Feng awakens long dormant sentiments in Song that threaten to drive a wedge between the two killers.

{"description": "Since its network debut in 1960,The Andy Griffith Showhas been a viewer favorite thanks to its folksy, nostalgic charm and memorable cast, both of which shine in this set featuring the series' debut season. Originally spun off from an episode ofMake Room for Daddy(both series shared producers Sheldon Leonard and Danny Thomas),The Andy Griffith Showcentered around the lives of small-town sheriff Andy Taylor (the marvelously dry Griffith), his son Opie (Ron Howard), cousin and deputy Barney Fife (multiple Emmy winner Don Knotts), and the other gentle eccentrics of Mayberry (which was based on Griffith's real hometown). But while other \"rural\" programs poked fun at its characters (The Real McCoys,The Beverly Hillbillies),The Andy Griffith Shownever stooped to stereotypes, preferring instead to draw its humor from the fine writing and cast, which counted Frances Bavier as Aunt Bee, Howard McNear as Floyd the Barber, and Hal Campbell as Mayberry's benevolent drunk, Otis, among the first season ensemble. All 32 episodes (including the epilogues, which are rarely aired in syndication) are compiled on this four-disc set, which regrettably lacks any supplemental features.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007Y08P6", "B0009UC7MK", "B000B8I9ZY", "B000BYRCF6", "B000EBGE82", "B000FSME10", "B000HWZ4IY", "B003SLEDJC", "B008KZX7W0", "B005SQRYOG", "B000EGDANO", "B00FWMVVF4", "B000B7HZUK", "B00004TGYD", "B008L36520", "B000291Q3Y", "B00009VRF0", "B00HVFA36I", "B001E6JC30", "B0009OUBPQ", "B000HWZ4J8", "B0001DMXEC", "B0006Z2L4W", "B001LM64VK", "B0000AUXVS", "B001992NZG", "B0018E03CW", "B0000V4906", "B002ZTLVXY", "B0009I7NH6", "B001BN4WHW", "B00A2L1CKO", "B001AZIRY0", "1558530983", "B001DMVZJ4", "B000002T6S", "B000005KXI", "B00000HY5X", "B00650RX72", "B004NJC0RK", "B002E58FT2", "B0001IN0BC", "B00198X0YK", "B000YKYT1M", "B001NRPQKI", "B0007KIFK0", "B00HR2HTRQ", "B000NA21YA", "B0007TKNHO", "B00H8KC1N4", "B00A2L1CJK", "B001DHXT4I", "B00005JLIC", "B000068V9Y", "B001JAHPMG", "B001992NXI", "B000EXZFS0", "B000A9QKSM", "B002NZK5WS", "B0050MB5AC", "B000O59A1G", "B00016XN48", "B00016JE5U", "B000RTAUZO", "B00009QG5P", "B008VNIBTK", "B00005JOEB", "B0025X4PAQ", "B0002NY8R6", "B000FSMEB0", "B000SSQ7JW", "B008H6GH9W", "B000PHX5KU", "B008VNI9EW", "B003IB0FTE", "B000EHSVB4", "B000000ECZ", "B0000C2IVT", "B000CCBCHQ", "B000MGTQ6G", "B0038SUBDC", "B00007KK5J", "B00650RWGO", "B00274SIVK", "B0000BV1XX", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B001OXLGKA", "B005DDN51A", "B00018D404", "B008VNI9TC", "B00GOC75YW", "B0085Z6ZD8", "B003CNQPMY", "B0009B16TO", "B005D7E7Y0", "B00650RWZA", "B001E549KC", "B008L3653O", "B00FFARI7I", "B0000B1A5A"], "bought_together": ["B0007Y08P6", "B0009UC7MK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007WFY4S", "B0007Y08P6", "B0009UC7MK", "B000NA21YA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7076}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.0, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B0002NY8PI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61XCYJEZSAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Andy Griffith Show - The Complete First Season"}

{"description": "Mike Hodges and Clive Owen, director and star of the stylish 1998 crime dramaCroupier, team again in this moody, almost contemplative thriller about a former gangster, Will Graham (Owen), who returns to London after a lengthy self-exile. In a tragic coincidence, Will's brother, Davey (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), has just committed suicide following a rape by a wealthy car dealer (Malcolm McDowell). Convinced there is more to Davey's death than meets the eye, Will--arguing he is nothing like his old, violent, urban self--slowly evolves again into a formidable criminal. Hodges and screenwriter Trevor Preston emphasize tone and spiritual inference over precise character motivation. Not everything that can be known about Will (especially his rocky psychological state and history with a former lover, played by Charlotte Rampling) is expressly stated. But one can feel his stifled nature rising, paradoxically, toward revenge, and his final actions have an existential power and mystery.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001BKACG", "B001KEHAEE", "B005TTEFZ8", "076782153X", "B00080ZHD2", "B00005UW73", "B005M2AKJW", "B000FO0AD8", "B0030Y11T2", "B00020VZTS", "B000GIXLXE", "B000EQHXNW", "B000255LIY", "B000RIWAVC", "0783241909", "B004U7MR4G", "B00C7T0EPS", "B002ZG97O2", "B004O8OLO0", "B004SEUIU6", "B004XNNUZ2", "B000E5KURY", "B004499LX0", "B000HRMAPE", "B0006FO8E8", "B000MGB6NM", "B000291Q52", "B00GTZWVXE", "B006MQ0ERK", "B00133KFGW", "B00CX7OWWA", "B00FRQ0HOQ", "B000CBCWIK", "B0050ODZ6M", "B00IKM5NJS", "B0000UJLF0", "B00005B20H", "B00009QGA7", "B000GFLKF8", "B007RFJCN2", "B007CEFTSA", "B00HGBAG5K", "B0000UJL82", "B0007R4TJ4", "B00008R9KB", "B00005JM2Y", "B000P2A2WY", "B00HUCF420", "B000E6ESKS", "B001G9CNI6", "B00121QGPY", "0790729407", "B006ISJQ26", "B0042RJWTC", "B00BNWWVFG", "B00BTYU3W6", "B00GD7UO6E", "B00BQXTCVS", "B0002I8372", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B0041SI798", "B005NHZALE", "B00GOHZLDO", "B001BNFRB2", "B00GJNQ4B6", "B001RXDM2M", "B004XNNV2Y", "B00AATGDUC", "B001G6E7N8", "0767833600", "B0011VJRVU", "B000XUF6B0", "B000KJU18C", "B0013D8LC2", "B00GHP8SH4", "B00H9KKGTO", "B0062P3392", "B00DU22OI6", "B0083HXKAY", "B001CC7PLM", "B002AT8KAG", "B000ZS8GW6", "B000TGJ81M", "B0016MJ6HY", "B00005R87B", "6305428085", "B009WGYXIS", "B0015XHQTY", "B000092T3P", "B00005JN2Z", "B00BEIYKM6", "B009R8Q8Y8", "B000FOPPBA", "B0060ZJ7DA", "B000N6TX1I", "B009AMAKWM", "B0002YLCG0", "B00388PK7O", "B005K8QIS0"], "bought_together": ["B0001BKACG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001BKACG", "B001KEHAEE", "B00133KFGW", "B0002YLCG0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 248856}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.8, "brand": "", "asin": "B0002WZTJS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51546K1RQFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "I'll Sleep When I'm Dead"}

{"description": "Bubbly, and yet sharply shrewd, comedian Kathy Griffin reflects on some of her personal experiences in Hollyweird. The stand-up comedian caught audiences' attention when she stole the show in Brooke Shields's TV sitcom SUDDENLY SUSAN. Here Griffin shares gossip on such celebrities as Gwyneth Paltrow, Ren&#xE9;e Zellweger, and Sandra Bullock. Her stories revolve around odd, bizarre, or unpleasant encounters with superstars. For example, she reveals the name of the picky celebrity who refused to join her onstage at an awards show, and dishes about what really happened at Brooke Shields's wedding. Then there was the time Kathy found herself partying with Barbara Walters. This spitfire's take on celebrity life is uproarious and, without a doubt, courageous.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B008HUSFO8", "B002NN7EYM", "B008073048", "B000OHZKYU", "B003H3TO4U", "B003W93GKC", "B00433KF1E", "B0047LO8KQ", "B005MQ58RC", "B000H7J9JE", "B002VKB0MO", "B009TTTLD0", "034551856X", "B00009W8NH", "B0017V8PL2", "B002KLQ31C", "B0043RT8LI", "B00FSGZ5ZG", "B00005JLL1", "B00006HAVX", "B00005ML8T", "0345518519", "B0000399WN", "B00DSKSZXI", "B00IQ8TQMG", "B008B4LRMC", "B001PJRAUI", "B000A2UBPM", "B0046ZYEUC", "B001D2WUDO", "B000A88ETQ", "B0002CHJHS", "B00026L9BQ", "B000AAF28A", "B00DFBVIVG", "B0000CDRW5", "B00009EIR6", "B002OVED74", "B003F674A0", "B004DOTKBO", "B000ANVQ5U", "B00A3A3V0I", "0780629167", "B000BXJ1Y2", "B000DZ95LW", "B002L9N4YW", "B00007JZVV", "B008OIQYQY", "B000077VQ6", "B00006RCO1", "B0000542C7", "B00AMHFPXS", "B000AP04FG", "B0009Y265Y", "B00404ME10"], "bought_together": ["B008HUSFO8", "B002NN7EYM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008HUSFO8", "B000OHZKYU", "034551856X", "B002NN7EYM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 78967}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 5.04, "brand": "Anchor Bay Entertainment, Inc.", "asin": "B0002Y4TB0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G9VC0N89L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Kathy Griffin - Allegedly"}

{"description": "Dramatically speaking, the third season ofThe Shieldis dysfunctional in the \"best\" sense of the word. Relationships fester in a quagmire of personal and professional conflict, and clashing agendas inspire some of finest episodes of this volatile series. Det. Mackey (Michael Chiklis) struggles to save his crumbling family (including two autistic children) while his strike team endures internal tensions over their secret stash of stolen drug money. Shane (Walton Goggins) clashes with teammate Tavon (Brian J. White) with near-fatal consequences, and his demanding fianc&#xE9;e tests his loyalty to Mackey. Capt. Aceveda (Benito Martinez) suffers unspeakable humiliation en route to city council promotion, engaging Wyms (CCH Pounder) in a battle of wills over proper command of \"The Barn.\" Dutch (Jay Karnes) pursues the \"cuddler rapist\" case and confronts the dark side of his soul, while Danny (Catherine Dent) revives her career and is re-partnered with Julien (Michael Jace), who suppresses his homosexuality in a desperate quest for conventional marriage and family. After Lemon (Kenneth Johnson) attempts a drastic solution to their \"money train\" worries, the shaken strike team faces a deeply uncertain future.As always,The Shieldjuggles multiple plotlines with relentless pacing and narrative economy, packing substantial character developments into all 15 of these action-packed episodes. This season's inclusion of a competitive decoy squad offers humor and professional sacrifice, and the pivotal David Mamet-directed episode \"Strays\" arrives at a shocking conclusion, with Mamet regulars Clark Gregg and Rebecca Pidgeon (Mamet's wife) giving outstanding guest-star performances. Series star Chiklis (whose pugnacious mug dominates the DVD packaging) makes his directorial debut on \"Slipknot,\" and eight episodes include informative, entertaining commentaries by the principal cast and crew. A generous archive of deleted scenes illustrate the agonizing decisions required by the time constraints of episodic TV, and the making-of documentary offers an intimate look at the series' collaborative writing process. With major developments (including a new role for Glenn Close) in store for season 4, these episodes maintain the high standard of provocative drama that loyalShieldfans have come to expect.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0012CJQZ0", "B0012CJQYG", "B0012CJQZA", "B0015TX2LO", "B0020TS5EM", "B0012CJQY6", "B000OIOOVE", "B000ENUYGI", "B0008JIJ1A", "B002ZCY80O", "B000YW8RPE", "B003XMKUEI", "B00166647K", "B007A2Z3Y4", "B0025KVKDE", "B00B5J6A7W", "B00188XHF8", "B0058YPPN0", "B000QXDJLI", "B0006IUD9Y", "B001NXDIMK", "B0002ERXC2", "B000FTCLSU", "B004HW7JNS", "B00123BY6S", "B0000Y40PW", "B00188XHFI", "B00BUEUH6C", "B0038M2APA", "B003CPPY5G", "B009VXVMAO", "B00EEDNR9A", "B00AB65RUG", "B0060MYKYY", "B0024FAR5M", "B0036TGTF2", "B00031TYBC", "B002N5N5QQ", "B001934SNM", "B0032UYFA6", "B00005Y6YJ", "B0058YPGSY", "B0058YPG1G", "B003L77GK6", "B0002XVQSU", "B001RTSPVY", "B000QUTTPG", "B000RO6JY0", "B008H6GHF6", "B000FKO3GW", "B0024F08RO", "B00005JNJ1", "B000BO7DWI", "B00008YGRU", "B000NA1VI2", "B000ICLRKC", "B00000FBH2", "B00005NOHO", "B0024FAR4I", "B0001O3YLM", "B001DJLCRC", "B001AQBGM4", "B0007YMVWO", "B003CN5SAY", "B000EULSR0", "B009LDCZ7I", "B0013FSL16", "B002AMVED8", "B00915G6WQ", "B001L1S1S0", "B001OQCVFG", "B005LAJ1H2", "B00CT48W14", "B000FUTVLO", "B009LDD54K", "B00166UFSY", "B000G1R4TS", "B00BR6RVEY", "B0051GOB2G", "B00J5LXT44", "B000LE178Y", "B0016Q0HY6", "B0058YPILY", "B0009GV9E6", "B002N5N5M0", "B00BGI076M", "B003L77GRO", "B000NDEXK2", "B00BWDFP5E", "B000ENC6QY", "B001HUWQEA", "B000067S1G", "B00008PW1F", "B00GMV8IVE", "B000NVI2GU", "B00IWTVDUW", "B000FIMG68", "B0006FO5LO", "B00008PHCZ", "B001BMGXTI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DJYJRHG", "B0012CJQYG", "B0012CJQY6", "B0012CJQZ0"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 132778}, "asin": "B0006GAO68", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51V261W3TPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Shield - The Complete Third Season"}

{"description": "A sizable hit with both teen audiences and sports-themed movie enthusiasts, 1984'sThe Karate Kidhad the right combination of heart and action to spawn three sequels of varying quality between 1986 and 1994; all four features have been packaged together in this three-disc set. Though plot elements varied from film to film, the core story (and the series' greatest strength) remained the same--the relationship between a wise Japanese martial arts teacher (skillfully underplayed by comedian Pat Morita) and his young American student (Ralph Macchio in the first three films, and future Oscar winner Hilary Swank in the final entry,The Next Karate Kid). The first of the Morita/Macchio matchups remains the best of the four features, with excellent performances from both leads and director John G. Avildsen (who also handledRockyand the first twoKidsequels) expertly balancing the emotional moments with the pure excitement of the martial arts tournament that serves as its finale.The subsequent sequels with Macchio seemed pulpier (especiallyThe Karate Kid, Part II, with its rekindled wartime romance subplot), and the inevitable come-from-behind competitions lacking the impact of the original; 1994'sThe Next Karate Kid(directed by Christopher Cain) put a slight spin on the formula by replacing Macchio with belligerent teen Swank, but it too seems like a retread of the first film. Still, the messages inherent to each film--finding one's inner strength, trusting your heart--should ring true to new generations of younger viewers. Fans may find theCollectionlight on supplemental features--while all four films are presented in anamorphic widescreen format, only the original (which was previously released in pan-and-scan only) offers commentary by Avildsen, Macchio and Morita and several making-of featurettes; the three sequels, packed into two discs, offer no extras.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002ZG99CC", "B004FQX5C0", "B002ZG99CM", "B000TWJ2CG", "B0087F7VSY", "B001ER4CPM", "B0054OGQM8", "B000068TPB", "B000068QPY", "B0006J28MI", "B001DDBD5E", "B0009RCPY8", "B000065V42", "B001SXZ7T2", "B001LMAK9C", "B000P0J0A6", "B001E75QH0", "B004SIPAFK", "B00HF98SJY", "B000Y11B7Q", "B0000639EX", "B00028HBES", "B0006GAOGS", "B000P0J09W", "B0000639HQ", "B000065V3H", "B003PIUIJ2", "B00008DDXA", "B00FAI3JE6", "B002SAMMFG", "B0008JIJ2E", "B00F4FFO8E", "6305428387", "B000PHX5P0", "B00008G8LM", "B00AMSQBP8", "B00JPQ1HX4", "B007I6JZVE", "B000059H9A", "B000067FP8", "B0057RCFQS", "B00JK531ES", "6305428050", "B00A7AN2SK", "B00005T7HZ", "B008R65XKG", "0767827686", "B00015YVD6", "B001DJLD2G", "B000ZBEOEC", "B000FC2FQA", "B003UN0752", "B00005A8XX", "B00H5NY7O0", "B0000DIXDR", "B00008979O", "B007STBUHI", "B0000696HW", "B0002O7XUE", "B000BUE5E6", "B0015RRNN4", "B006JTS6XY", "B003UESJLK", "B001GLFPWK", "B000P6XQ50", "B00008WFU5", "B0060FXDCG", "B000209KMW", "B0009X75QU", "B000RJO56E", "B00C7MW5HU", "B001DPHDBA", "B00008WFU4", "B00386F0D0", "B008D1Q1WE", "B0000C6HI0", "B00AEFXMMO", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00009OWI3"], "bought_together": ["B002ZG99CC", "B00G5G7EXY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001CCSI2W", "B0008JIJ2E", "B002ZG99CC", "B0038M2RLC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6745}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 22.88, "brand": "Sony Pictures", "asin": "B0006OBPTA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518LUtjqhRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Karate Kid Collection (Four Film Set)"}

{"description": "While 2003'sDaredevilwas a conventional superhero movie, the 2005 spinoff,Elektra, is more of awuxia-styled martial arts/fantasy flick. Elektra (Jennifer Garner) has returned to her life as a hired assassin, but she balks at an assignment to kill a single father (Goran Visnjic,ER) and his teenage daughter (Kirsten Prout). That makes her the target of the Hand, an organization of murderous ninjas, scheming corporate types, and a band of stylish supervillains seeking to eliminate Elektra and tip the balance of power in the ongoing battle of good vs. evil.As the star ofAlias, Garner has proven that she can kick butt with the best of them, and some of the visual effects are impressive, but the action sequences tend to be anticlimactic, and there's not much to the story. Fans will notice numerous references toFrank Miller's comic books, but there's very little resemblance to Miller's cold-blooded killer (Elektra with an agent? Elektra referring to herself as a \"soccer mom\"?).IsElektrabetter thanDaredevil? Not really, even with the distinct advantage of having all Garner and no Ben Affleck. That could be the spinoff's greatest disappointment: afterSpider-Man 2raised the bar for comic-book movies,Elektralowered it back toDaredevil's level.  Directed by Rob Bowman (theX-Filesmovie), and featuring Terence Stamp as the mysterious mentor Stick, Will Yun Lee (Die Another Day) as the chief villain, and NFL-player-turned-mixed-martial-arts-champion Bob Sapp as the immovable Stone.DVD featuresBen Affleck's much-rumored cameo is one of the deleted scenes on theElektraDVD.  It's a one-minute throwaway, and while he's supposedly appearing as Matt Murdock (who romanced Elektra inDaredevil), the barrage of celebrity gossip makes it impossible to see him as anything other than Jennifer Garner's real-life boyfriend.  There's also a making-of featurette, which is mostly promotional hype other than a few interesting effects shots; four editing featurettes; and Jennifer Garner's videotaped message to ComicCon.--David HoriuchiMore onElektraElektra: The Album(Soundtrack CD)Elektra: The Movie(Comic Adaptation)Frank Miller Comic BooksDaredevil(Director's Cut) (DVD)Jennifer Garner stars inAlias(DVD)More Superhero DVDs", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000959N0", "B000VI70QS", "B00005JNTU", "B0006L0LOS", "B000FGGE68", "B001QB9H1U", "B001CDR1FG", "B000OVLBF8", "B00AEFXCLU", "B0002IQMAM", "B005LAIGW8", "B001DHXT20", "B004EPZ07K", "B001F7MSFM", "B001GCUO1Q", "B0009A409S", "B008JFUS0U", "B002GSXKNI", "B00E5I2MEK", "B004LWZW42", "B0007V6ITE", "B000UR9T8C", "B001AK3S4Y", "B00K7IPFSM", "B00E5I2MCM", "078401132X", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00005JM5B", "B0090SI56Y", "B00005JKWJ", "B004LWZWFQ", "B0002KVUKM", "B000HCO83Q", "B003YOZNBU", "B000J10EQU", "B00003CXZ1", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000AYELVU", "B00005JMQW", "B008JFUO72", "B003Y5H5EW", "B000HEVZ9E", "B000AYELVA", "B000VI28Z6", "B00JL6L4UY", "B009MO57H6", "B00AEFYGBA", "B002ZG99B8", "B0083SBMBM", "B001CC7PKS", "B00005JKCH", "B0007WFX62", "B0006IIPIK", "6307397594", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B0009MDPYM", "B001OQCVI8", "B00JPS7HOA", "0780624890", "B00F4FFO8E", "B002GSXKN8", "B008JFUPFI", "B00IKM5LXG", "B00177Y9ZC", "B003YAR97K", "B002ZG98UA", "B002NXSRVG", "B000EQHXN2", "B001RHGRT8", "B00IZZDWKM", "B001GZ6QC4", "B004LWZWGA", "B0021L8V0M", "B000VR0570", "1558908846", "B001HN697M", "B00005JLYW", "B008JFURII", "B001MVWRNE", "B001FB55HQ", "B005LAII44", "B00A2H9OSK", "B001QTXM5Y", "B002ZG983M", "B00BTYMPUY", "B002U4UZSQ", "B001QB9H2E", "B002ZG99G8", "B005G4TJUC", "B0012RLX88", "B003Q6D2B4", "B00195FUDC", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B001OQCUZM", "B00HMVJB0K", "B002ZG98N2", "B00005JNJV", "B004SIP9Z6", "B000K7UBSO", "B00HEPDGKA"], "bought_together": ["B0002XVQNU", "B000VI70QS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JLXE", "B0090SI56Y", "B00979KQAO", "B000VI28Z6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 23534}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.99, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B0007P0Y7C", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R5W%2BoU9CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Elektra (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "If you spliced Charles Addams, Dr. Seuss, Charles Dickens, Edward Gorey, and Roald Dahl into a Tim Burtonesque landscape, you'd surely come up with something likeLemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events. Many critics (in mostly mixed reviews) wondered why Burton didn't direct this comically morbid adaptation of thefirst three booksin the popular series by Daniel Handler (a.k.a. \"Lemony Snicket,\" played here by Jude Law and seen only in silhouette) instead of TV andCasperveteran Brad Silberling, but there's still plenty to recommend the playfully bleak scenario, in which three resourceful orphans thwart their wicked, maliciously greedy relative Count Olaf (Jim Carrey), who subjects them to... well, a series of unfortunate events. Along the way they encounter a herpetologist uncle (Billy Connolly), an anxious aunt (Meryl Streep) who's afraid ofeverything, and a variety of fantastical hazards and mysterious clues, some of which remain unresolved. Given endless wonders of art direction, costume design, and cinematography, Silberling's direction is surprisingly uninspired (in other words, the books are better), but when you add a throwaway cameo by Dustin Hoffman, Law's amusing narration, and Carrey's over-the-top antics, the firstLemonymovie suggests a promising franchise in the making.--Jeff ShannonA Message from Count OlafDear Adoring Fan of Count Olaf,Perhaps once every thousand years, a talent emerges that completely changes the way movies are made, orphans are orphaned, and heartthrobs throb. Often this talent has only one eyebrow, as is the case with one of the most cherished and admired actors scheming today. Surely you can you guess of whom I think.No, you fool! I am referring to the One...the Only...the Unbelievably Handsome Count Olaf!Or, as I like to call him, Me.If you&#x92;ve already seen my performance in Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, you must still be speechless. But if you haven&#x92;t, you are in serious danger. Just teasing. But you could be after I send one of my gifted henchpersons to your home!So why not get my movie on DVD? This major motion spectacle has everything. Me, acting! Leeches, attacking! Orphans, almost falling off a cliff! Of course, if you are familiar with books by Lemony Snicket, you know that they include all of these things too, but most of what he says is lies, and the rest is completely boring.There's never been a film that demands repeated viewing in quite the same way, with a diabolical genius writing you a letter that says, \"I DEMAND REPEATED VIEWING!!!\" Plus with DVD extras, you&#x92;ll get at least 20% more Olaf for your money. And... just for you, for an unlimited time only, I&#x92;ll throw in Aunt Josephine free with purchase.*So, noble Amazonians, put down your hunting spears and exotic headdresses, and prepare to bask in True Greatness. Or, as I like to call it, Me.Of course you may have my autograph!Count Olaf*Count Olaf will not be held liable or accept blame in any way for any and all liability, loss, damage, or personal injury (including death), without limit and without regard once Aunt Josephine is thrown in, due to the unpredictable behavior of hungry leeches.Stills fromLemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events(Click to Enlarge)Violet, Count Olaf, and KlausAunt JosephineCount Olaf and Aunt JosephineDirecting Jim CarreyKlaus, Mr. Poe, Sunny, and VioletCount OlafOlaf AscendingThe Baudelaire OrphansAll Things SnicketSee a complete list of allLemony Snicket's creations, including books from theSeries of Unfortunate Events, calendars, and more.The Essential Lemony Snicket BooksA Series of Unfortunate Events: The Ominous Omnibus, Books 1-3The Situation Worsens: A Box of Unfortunate Events, Books 4-6The Dilemma Deepens: A Box of Unfortunate Events, Books 7-9The Slippery Slope: A Series of Unfortunate Events, Book 10The Grim Grotto: A Series of Unfortunate Events, Book 11A Library of Unfortunate Events, Books 1-10Behind the Scenes with Count Olaf: A Series of Unfortunate Events Movie BookLemony Snicket: The Unauthorized AutobiographyThe Puzzling PuzzlesActivity BookMore from the MovieOriginal Movie PosterSoundtrackWall PosterLemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate EventsComputer & Video GamesFor PS2For PCFor XboxFor GameCube", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB8KQ", "B001NPD9JA", "B000OYCM5I", "0061119067", "0061146331", "0061146315", "0061146307", "0064410161", "006055620X", "0060095563", "B0016Q2D5M", "B00009XUM5", "B0002W4UDE", "0064410153", "B00139W3NE", "0064408647", "0064407691", "0060586583", "B001LPWGBO", "0060839090", "0064410145", "B000Q66FB6", "B000G1R394", "B007R6DJP8", "006029809X", "B004M1A21K", "0060562250", "B000E8M0VA", "0064408655", "B0000VCZKW", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B00AEFY9RG", "B00AEBB8DI", "B000J10FLY", "0064410129", "B000GB5MH4", "B00AEFY8FO", "B001APZMJS", "0060566159", "B001HN694K", "0807219908", "B00H5NY7DQ", "B003HARV3Y", "B000C3L27U", "B0001I9YGW", "B004A8ZX3C", "0064408639", "B00005JPH2", "B00005JLOT", "B001DPHDCY", "0064408663", "B002ZG984Q", "B002ZG97F6", "0767836324", "B0000VCZKM", "B0000YTP02", "B005F96UJ6", "B000031EGV", "B00028HBES", "B003L20IJM", "B000M343BC", "B000ELJAEM", "B002WJI2QQ", "B002GHHHNS", "0783235070", "B004AKCME8", "B0000640SC", "B00081912E", "0807219916", "B000P0J09W", "B00IEXX4KS", "B0036TGSIK", "B00005JG6M", "0783225482", "B008QE9XD2", "B000QGDY0G", "B00AEFXJS6", "B000P0J0A6", "B00437IEI6", "6305123454", "B002JUFPX6", "B0006JMLRK", "B008JFUNTG", "B005LAIH4A", "B000AP04FG", "B0009NZ2KG", "B001QOGYAO", "B000BB1MI2", "B0014Z4OMU", "B000E6EHE0", "B002NZK5SW", "B00005JOWW", "0783219806"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0061146307", "B00AEBB8KQ", "B000OYCM5I", "0061119067"]}, "price": 13.47, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 48674}, "asin": "B0007PICAI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510HCJR3SCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lemony Snicket's a Series of Unfortunate Events (Full Screen Edition)"}
{"description": "\"Still great.\" These words, spoken by Raymond (Ray Romano) to his wife, Debra (Patricia Heaton) at the poignant conclusion of the flashback episode \"How They Met,\" help close outEverybody Loves Raymond's wonderful third season. He is referring not only to the hapless cook's lone signature dish, lemon chicken, but to their marriage as well. But he could just as well have been referring toRaymonditself. The Emmy-worthy ensemble (at this point, still losing out to theFrasierjuggernaut) are discovering new dimensions to their characters, and the show's writers are mining even more precious, intimately observed character-based comedy gold from the Barones' dysfunctional family life. Several episodes this season rank among the series' best, including \"How They Met\" and the totally whacked \"Robert's Date,\" in which Robert (Brad Garrett) desperately tries to fit in with his black partner and her friends. This is a pivotal season for Raymond's Eeyore-esque brother, who finally declares his independence and moves out of his parents' home and into his own apartment. This does not help his love life. In the hilarious episode \"Robert Moves Back,\" Robert and Amy (Monica Horan) at last consummate their relationship, but are devastated when they learn they were exposed through curtainless windows to the other tenants in Robert's building (\"You ruined our Bible study\"). For viewers with a strong investment in these characters, there are earth-rocking time capsule moments, as in \"The Visit,\" when Debra lashes out at her preoccupied mother that she wishes she were more involved in the family like Marie (Doris Roberts).What elevatesRaymondis that it is much more than just wisecracks and putdowns. The peerless cast deftly navigates the fine line between comedy and drama. \"Frank's Tribute\" concludes with a rare, touching moment between the verbally abusive Frank (Peter Boyle) and Marie in which he gently cradles her in his arms to remove cold cream from her face. At the conclusion of \"Driving Frank,\" the road accident-prone Frank surrenders his car keys to Raymond. Not thatRaymondis going soft. It's still, first, last, and foremost, funny.

{"description": "Facing an indeterminate sentence of weeks/months/years until new episodes, fans ofThe Sopranosare advised to take the fifth; season, that is.

Michael Imperioli and Drea de Matteo also earned Best Supporting Actor and Actress honors for some of their finest hours as Christopher and Adriana. From the moment a wayward bear lumbers into the Sopranos' yard in the season opener, it is clear thatThe Sopranosis in anything but a \"stagmire.\" The series benefits from an infusion of new blood, the so-called \"Class of 2004,\" imprisoned \"family\" members freshly released from jail. Most notable among these is Tony's cousin, Tony Blundetto (Steve Buscemi, who directed the pivotal season three episode \"Pine Barrens\"!  ), who initially wants to go straight, but proves himself to be something of a \"free agent,\" setting up a climactic stand-off between Tony and New York boss Johnny Sack.Carmela and TonyThese 13 mostly riveting episodes unfold with a page-turning intensity with many rich subplots. Estranged couple Tony and Carmela (the incomparable James Gandolfini and Edie Falco) work toward a reconciliation (greased by Tony's purchase of a $600,000 piece of property for Carmela to develop). The Feds lean harder on an increasingly stressed-out and distraught Adriana to \"snitch\" with inevitable results. This season's hot-button episode is \"The Test Dream,\" in which Tony is visited by some of the series' dear, and not-so-dearly, departed in a harrowing nightmare. With this set, fans can enjoy marathon viewings of an especially satisfying season, but considering the long wait ahead for season six, best to take Tony's advice to his son, who, at one point, gulps down a champagne toast. \"Slow down,\" Tony says. \"You're supposed to savor it.\"--Donald LiebensonExplore MoreFor an even deeper immersion into the world of crime (movies, that is) see our guides tocrime classicsand our who's who compendium offamous mob bosses.Bada Bing!

{"description": "Year 2 of the youth-oriented series from the 1980s, popular in Canada and on American public television, remains uncompromising in its portrait of middle school-age kids as kids: complicated and unformed, a little vague about values and ethics, often powerless to affect their destinies or achieve what they believe to be right. Set in Toronto, the show follows the dilemmas of several students at Degrassi, though season 2 spends less time with the younger set than in the series'debut year. Perhaps that's because there are some truly serious matters for the program's 8th graders (mostly the same kids carrying over from season 1) to confront, including issues of teen pregnancy, alcoholism at home, inappropriate teacher behavior, censorship, sexism, and much more.The most pronounced storyline in season 2 is the pregnancy of Christine \"Spike\" Nelson (Amanda Stepto), a situation her peers seem to handle well but not so Degrassi's PTA or the local school board. These agitated adults want to pull Spike from school and force her into some kind of shame-based program for unwed mothers. Spike's friends stand up for her, including the earnest Caitlin (Stacie Mistysyn), whose editorial in support of Spike is rejected by the school paper's faculty advisor and ends up on a flyer passed around campus. (For her trouble, Caitlin receives detention and a lecture from Spike, who doesn't want to be a cause du jour.) Meanwhile, the father of Spike's baby, Shane (Bill Parrott), wants to help but is hindered by his parents, who want to sweep the whole matter under a rug. Apart from Spike's woes, season 2 finds a provocative recurring story in the arrival of a substitute teacher at Degrassi, a handsome fellow with a subtle tendency to touch female students in flirtatious ways, peer down blouses, etc. After Lucy (Anais Granofsky) is duped by his attentions, she makes a point of educating other girls about him. Sexual issues are also in the forefront of a confrontation between Joey (Pat Mastroianni) and Degrassi activist L.D. (Amanda Cook), the latter objecting to the presence of pin-up photos of near-naked women inside Joey's locker. L.D. retaliates with pin-ups of hunky guys in her own locker, embarrassing Joey and landing both of them in hot water with the principal. As with season 1, this suite of episodes really grows on a viewer and becomes irresistible family television. And, hey: what about those '80s hairdos.... Wow.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009OL934", "B0006U3SY4", "B000R5OFPO", "B000PWQPAM", "B00E4Q6U9Q", "B0035G5IS0", "B0035G5IQM", "B005FIXA90", "B0002VOY40", "B000E6EGMI", "B000M5AJOU", "B0009JKVSS", "B00007IG1M", "B008R52L3O", "B00171PAQA", "B000S0GYEI", "B007AFBYNA", "B005GRF2QY", "B00GLT2SOA", "B000VWQU88"], "bought_together": ["B0009OL934", "B0006U3SY4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0006U3SY4", "B0009OL934", "B000R5OFPO", "B0035G5IS0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 67544}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 7.0, "brand": "PBS", "asin": "B0007YXPLK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KB04XRKDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Degrassi Junior High: Season 2"}

{"description": "From Hollywood's legendary Cocoanut Grove to the pioneering conquest of the wild blue yonder, Martin Scorsese'sThe Aviatorcelebrates old-school filmmaking at its finest. We say \"old school\" only because Scorsese's love of golden-age Hollywood is evident in his approach to his subject--Howard Hughes in his prime (played by Leonardo DiCaprio in his)--and especially in his technical mastery of the medium reflecting his love for classical filmmaking of the studio era. Even when he's using state-of-the-art digital trickery for the film's exciting flight scenes (including one of the most spectacular crashes ever filmed), Scorsese's meticulous attention to art direction and costume design suggests an impassioned pursuit of craftsmanship from a bygone era; every frame seems to glow with gilded detail. And while DiCaprio bears little physical resemblance to Hughes during the film's 20-year span (late 1920s to late '40s), he efficiently captures the eccentric millionaire's golden-boy essence, and his tragic descent into obsessive-compulsive seclusion. Bolstered by Cate Blanchett's uncannily accurate portrayal of Katharine Hepburn as Hughes' most beloved lover,The Aviatoris easily Scorsese's most accessible film, inviting mainstream popularity without compromising Scorsese's artistic reputation. As compelling crowd-pleasers go, it's a class act from start to finish.--Jeff ShannonDVD FeaturesIn his commentary track, director Martin Scorsese offers his own impressions of Howard Hughes and rattles off his memories of experiencing Hughes's films.  He mentions how he made Cate Blanchett watch every Katharine Hepburn film from the '30s on the big screen, and observes that Kate Beckinsale had \"a real sense of the stature of a Hollywood goddess.\"  But in general he doesn't talk much about the craft of making the film.  That area is covered better by editor Thelma Schoonmaker, who also appears on the commentary track, and producer Michael Mann makes a few appearances (all were recorded separately).  The picture is brilliant, but the 5.1 sound is not as aggressive in the rear speakers and subwoofer as one might expect, other than some nice surround effects in theHell's Angelsflying sequence.The second disc collects almost three hours of features.  There's one unnecessary deleted scene, and an 11-minute making-of featurette that's basically the cast and director heaping praise on each other.  More interesting are the short featurettes on visual effects (including the XF-11 scene, of course), production design, costumes, hair and makeup, and score, and Loudon Wainwright discusses his and his children's musical performances.  Historical perspective is provided by spotlights on Hughes's role in aviation and his obsessive-compulsive disorder, and a 43-minute Hughes documentary from the History Channel (part of the Modern Marvels series, it focuses on his mechanical innovations and spends less than a minute on his movies).  More unusual are DiCaprio and Scorsese's appearance on an OCD panel, and a half-hour interview segment DiCaprio did with Alan Alda.--David HoriuchiThe Personalities ofThe AviatorClick the links to explore more movies by these stars.Leonardo DiCaprioasHoward Hughes\"Sometimes I truly fear that I... am losing my mind.

{"description": "In the spirit of WHEN HARRY MET SALLY comes A LOT LIKE LOVE, the romantic comedy about destiny and the possibilities of a chance encounter evolving into a close encounter of the happily-ever-after kind. Ashton Kutcher (GUESS WHO) and Amanda Peet (SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE) set off sparks as opposites who attract and have a one-flight stand from LA to New York.

{"description": "Words really do get in the way in3-Iron, a strange, poignant South Korean film from director Kim Ki-Duk (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring) in which the central character doesn't utter a single word. It's not explained why the puck never speaks, but it adds an element of mysticism to this love story that's at once humorous and disturbing. In this case, the knight in shining armor, Tae-Suk (Hee Jae) is a vagabond who supports himself by breaking into people's homes when they're on vacation. But rather than steal possessions, he cooks himself a meal, carefully washes the dishes, takes a bath, does their laundry, fixes anything broken, sleeps in their pajamas, and leaves each home spic and span. One day he trespasses on the home of a battered wife (Seung-yon Lee) who's still home. Fascinated, she leaves her husband and joins in his adventures, until one of their random break-ins gets them in trouble and the couple is forced apart.Adding in a reliance on some stunning visuals,3-Irondoes a good job filling itself out in a non-implicit way. In this case, compliments and banter aren't needed to tell you that the pair has found a bond that no one can wrest away from them. The ending may tickle suspended reality (it's either becoming supernatural or someone's a lot more nimble than we thought), but it's still a poetic conclusion to this twisted fairy tale.--Ellen A.

{"description": "Movie studios, by and large, avoid controversial subjects like race the way you might avoid a hive of angry bees. So it's remarkable thatCrasheven got made; that it's a rich, intelligent, and moving exploration of the interlocking lives of a dozen Los Angeles residents--black, white, latino, Asian, and Persian--is downright amazing. A politically nervous district attorney (Brendan Fraser) and his high-strung wife (Sandra Bullock, biting into a welcome change of pace fromMiss Congeniality) get car-jacked by an oddly sociological pair of young black men (Larenz Tate and Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges); a rich black T.V. director (Terrence Howard) and his wife (Thandie Newton) get pulled over by a white racist cop (Matt Dillon) and his reluctant partner (Ryan Phillipe); a detective (Don Cheadle) and his Latina partner and lover (Jennifer Esposito) investigate a white cop who shot a black cop--these are only three of the interlocking stories that reach up and down class lines. Writer/director Paul Haggis (who wrote the screenplay forMillion Dollar Baby) spins every character in unpredictable directions, refusing to let anyone sink into a stereotype. The cast--ranging from the famous names above to lesser-known but just as capable actors like Michael Pena (Buffalo Soldiers) and Loretta Devine (Woman Thou Art Loosed)--meets the strong script head-on, delivering galvanizing performances in short vignettes, brief glimpses that build with gut-wrenching force.

{"description": "Horror buffs will surely be compelled to compare and contrastDominionwithExorcist: The Beginning, two films weirdly linked by film history. Director Paul Schrader shotDominiononly to find studio bosses underwhelmed by its horror aspects, at which point Renny Harlin was hired to direct another take on the subject with the same lead actor, setting, and similar storyline. That became the 2004 theatrical releaseExorcist: The Beginning.As expected, the Schrader version has more tortured religiosity and visual poetry than Harlin's cheesier (but admittedly gripping) re-do. Father Merrin (Stellan Skarsgard) carries his guilt from the Nazi occupation to a remote African archaeological dig, where a mysteriously buried church has been uncovered. Strange stuff happens nearby, and a fervent young priest (good performance by Gabriel Mann) parries spiritual points with the now-doubting Merrin. Some of the ideas are strong and the sun-and-sand cinematography by the great Vittorio Storaro is often stunning.

{"description": "The beloved sitcomEverybody Loves Raymondwould be as brutal as a Strindberg drama if it didn't make familial bitterness so genuinely funny. Stand-up comedian Ray Romano (Ice Age) plays Ray Barone, a sportswriter married to Debra (the sharp and sexy Patricia Heaton) who has the misfortune to live just across the street from his invasive, bickering parents Frank and Marie (Peter Boyle,Young Frankenstein, and Doris Roberts,Remington Steele). Rounding out the cast is Ray's neglected older brother Robert (Brad Garrett,Gleason), whose every accomplishment has been ignored because his parents prefer to dote on the younger, cuter Ray. Robert, whose gloomy mug and huge size makes him loom over Ray like some malevolent alter-ego, is actually more honest and sensitive to the needs of others than is Ray, who's both self-centered and too eager to please--an impossible balance that Romano spins to great comic effect.The fifth season presents the show at the peak of its strength. The season opener, a two-part story about a trip to Italy, degenerates into schmaltz, but immediately afterwardEveryone Loves Raymondregains its bearings and launches into series of deftly played and skillfully written domestic skirmishes between husband and wife or parent and child. Episodes range from an explosive fight over wallpaper (a fan favorite) to anxiety over Ray's twin sons playing fairies in a school performance to the separation of Debra's seemingly perfect parents (Katherine Helmond,Brazil, and Robert Culp,I Spy). It's hard to imagine that any other show could get away with such a morbid view of marriage. In one episode, Ray and Debra panic when they realize they're running out of things to talk about; but after they witness Ray's parents having a meal without speaking a single word (a hypnoticpas de deuxbetween Boyle and Roberts), Debra persuades herself that being quiet with each other is true intimacy...but the show never tells you whether she's discovered marital zen or if she's just rationalizing the inevitable emotional heat-death of a life-long commitment. Robert's romantic troubles recur throughout the season, culminating in the nightmare of having his ex-girlfriends meet to hash out everything that's wrong with him. Just a slight adjustment in tone would makeEveryone Loves Raymonda bleak indictment of how people can be cruelest to those closest to them; instead, it's a cunningly comic celebration of how people can be cruelest to those closest to them.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000A7PKGW", "B0007R4SWC", "B006MFQ4DE", "B000T22PVG", "B004D2GMVM", "B000GRUMQY", "B000N8UXTW", "B0001ZMWXW", "B00CJ7Y1CK", "B0009E27DA", "B00070HK4C", "B000957O8C", "B000FBH3WC", "B0001BS3IY", "B0000CGNEC", "B000AJJNIQ", "B00G4SF9NA", "B005D0OHA6", "B000NA1W3Q", "B004WO9OMA", "B008LCRABQ", "B000I2J6VE", "B000EYK4H6", "B000GRU09S", "B0024F08TW", "B0001NBNJ8", "B004MWLXTY", "B0001Z3I1C", "B000B8384G", "B000K4X5QM", "B009LDD1X0", "B0002UE1WQ", "B000EBGFQI", "B000C1VBAA", "B000I2J6W8", "B000HT3PEM", "B0015XWU9A", "B002AMVEEM", "B001FSKE84", "B001NY4X3W", "B000TGJ82G", "B005BUA1GC", "B001DZOCVO", "B00B04NIOU", "B000B8I9ZY", "B000BYRCF6", "B0007KTBJO", "B008LCRA98", "B000QFCDAY", "B000RGULLA", "B00DVOA1AG", "B001DMVZM6", "B000W91RUG", "B000C6NPHC", "B000VDDE0Y", "B00BUWD7SO", "B0002W4SX6", "B0007US79Y", "B00GOC74Z2", "B005DCJ0Q0", "B00ECGIL9K", "B0006IUDYY", "B000FBH3WW", "B002JVWQUU", "B000WQWPSW", "B001DMVZNA", "B000B5XOUM", "B000YKYT1M", "B00008YGS0", "B008L0YN6I", "B001P9N9B2", "B0007Y08RY", "B0006Q93AQ", "B0007OCG74", "B000ND91OA", "B000640WGM", "B0002W4SWW", "B00005JLEX", "B00B04NJ12", "B000KGGIL4", "B000JBWWQK", "B0011UF79M", "B001L1S1W6", "B009LDD3I8", "B00127IU4S", "B000B5XOUC", "B003R4ZMSQ", "B003FSTN84", "B00I099K4U", "B0007YXRCW", "B000A0GOQY", "B000NA78SE", "B00009VRF0", "B0001ZJ1HW", "B00005JM3A"], "bought_together": ["B000A7PKGW", "B0007R4SWC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0007R4SWC", "B004D2GMVM", "B000A7PKGW", "B006MFQ4DE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 43646}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.76, "brand": "HBO HOME VIDEO", "asin": "B000BNTM46", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5152PE3661L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Everybody Loves Raymond: Season 5"}
{"description": "Following in the tradition of such great World War II films as \"Saving Private Ryan\" and \"Patton\", \"The Great Raid\" tells the true story of an American rescue mission that took place over five days in January, 1945. Cabanatuan prison was located some thirty miles behind Japanese lines. Inside its walls were over 500 American prisoners. Many were survivors of the Bataan death march. These men had been improsoned for over three years. Many began to feel that their country had left them behind.\n\nBy late 1944, the Americans had returned to the Philippines. After learning about the existance of Cabanatuan, the Americans devised a plan to send an elite group of Army Rangers in to resue the POWs. Lt. Col. Henry Mucci (Benjamin Bratt), commander of the 6th Ranger Batallion, was given the assignment of developing the mission. Captain Robert Prince (James Franco) was placed in charge of planning and actually carrying out the raid. The Rangers would have to travel thirty miles into enemy-held territory, much of the time in broad daylight with very little cover. Fortunately, they received a great deal of help from the Filipino resistance.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFXRRO", "B00AEFXVCU", "B00AEBBA36", "B0015D20FE", "B000M4RG42", "B00005PJ8T", "B000065U1N", "B000095WW8", "B001IBIHQ4", "B00006CXSS", "B00AEBB86U", "B00005JPKE", "B00001ZWUS", "B00005N5S3", "B00005JK8K", "0471037427", "038549565X", "0792839730", "B001KZOUU0", "B00C2535TE", "B0007TKNGA", "B00HEPE6MM", "079284646X", "B007HCI42A", "B000EHSVSC", "B000MGTQ7U", "B003ASLJOU", "B004C45AZU", "B000WMA6R8", "B00772M1D8", "B000E0WJN2", "B000ELL1R6", "B00BTYNXL4", "B005LAIGYQ", "B000MRA542", "B00005AVZU", "B003ELKNH2", "B000E5N6KW", "B00003CXHJ", "0792844017", "B00005PJ8K", "B000O599YO", "B00AEFYBA6", "B00003CXTG", "B0007KIFGE", "B00004XPPG", "B003AWRMCO", "B005DKS1TE", "B007WXUVHU", "B000R9U3B0", "B005OTGS4E", "B000066C6J", "B000EHSVS2", "B00005PJ8S", "B00005U8F4", "B00BY0EBK0", "B00005R87B", "B00096S4B2", "B00AEFYENK", "B00005JKTP", "B008JFUNKU", "B000P0J09C", "B00004XPPC", "B002EAYE0Q", "B00275EGWY", "B00008AOTR", "B002OGMGV4", "B001PO55LE", "B002O3Z510", "B00AEBB86A", "B00D3XMA9A", "B00DL48BM6", "0792838408", "B00AEFXKUI", "B005LAIGRS", "B000EHSVVE", "B00005N5S2", "B00K2CHY1Y", "B000NVT0RU", "B00008R9M6", "B00008J2PG", "B00003CXA6", "B001CU9D2I", "B002ZG97RE", "B005HQBO9I", "B00005OSJQ", "B00008AOTO", "B00JA3RVG4", "B000O599VC", "B004SJVQ4I", "B004P7CMVE", "B0001NBMH6", "B00080ETYA", "B00005R23T", "0385495641", "B00004ZBVG", "B00021R7BM", "B00CLH09UQ", "B004GSVXBW", "B00911L7VA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEFXVCU", "B00AEFXRRO", "B00AEBBA36", "B00001ZWUS"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 239439}, "asin": "B000BOH8UA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WY802K3GL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Great Raid (Widescreen Director's Cut)"}
{"description": "HasYoung Mr. Lincoln--the first cardinal masterpiece of director John Ford's career, and the finest film of that epochal Hollywood year 1939--been neglected because people fear it's a stodgy history lesson? Even Henry Fonda, drafted to play the title role, was reluctant till Ford testily explained, \"This isn't 'The Great Emancipator,' for God's sake--it's a movie about this jackleg lawyer....\" And so it is: a small, slow-gathering village tale about a young man whose biggest moments--such as losing the love of his life--occur between scenes, and whose emergence as a historic figure is decades away. Yet the essential Lincoln is being forged in luminous scenes that unfold with the simplicity of fable, only no one knows it's a fable yet. The French title for the movie says it beautifully:Toward His Destiny.The script, by Lamar Trotti, introduces Lincoln as a frontier storekeeper and drolly inadequate politician. In an early scene, we see Abe receiving his first books of law in a casual transaction with a pioneer family on their way to make a new home in the wilderness. But was it Trotti or the director who decided that this same family should circle back into Abe's life years later for the dramatic heart of the film, a murder trial in which his wit, ingenuity, and bedrock decency shape Lincoln's first public triumph--and that neither Lincoln nor the family recognize they have met before?That's typical of the movie, in which what is most important, most definitive, most valuable, is always outside the frame, out of reach, beyond naming. Even triumph is imbued with a heartbreaking sense of loss.This transcendently beautiful film was a modest production, without the Pulitzer Prize cachet ofAbe Lincoln in Illinois(not a Ford picture) the following year. Fonda, in his first of six collaborations with Ford, is the only marquee name in the cast, though Alice Brady is radiant as the pioneer matriarch (her final performance), and Ford stalwart Ward Bond has a key role. Sergei Eisenstein, no less, wrote a lucid and impassioned appreciation of the film, hailing it as \"a movie I would like to have made\"--and proved it by stealing a few visual tropes for his ownIvan the Terrible! This is a great, great motion picture, eminently deserving of the Criterion treatment on DVD.--Richard T.

A waiter for four years since high school, Dean (Justin Long) has never questioned his job at Shenanigan's. But when he learns that Chett, a high school classmate, now has a lucrative career in electrical engineering, he's thrown into turmoil about his dead-end life. Dean's friend Monty (Ryan Reynolds) is in exactly the same boat, but he couldn't care less. More concerned with partying and getting laid, Monty is put in charge of training Mitch (John Francis Daley), a shy new employee.  Over the course of one chaotic shift, Mitch gets to know the rest of Shenanigan's quirky staff: Monty's tough-talking ex-girlfriend, Serena (Anna Faris), Shenanigan's over-zealous manager, Dan (David Koechner), and head cook Raddimus (Luis Guzman), who's obsessed with a senseless staff-wide competition known only as \"The Game\"...  Featuring crazy busboys, unsanitary kitchen antics, and lots of talk about sex, WAITING... is a hysterical, behind-the-scenes look at the restaurant industry, and an affectionate ode to those lost, and thoroughly unproductive, days of youth.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001MFNB58", "B000EMGJAO", "B000069CF0", "B000LC3ICE", "B000E6EHE0", "B00363WGBO", "B000JJ4DNW", "B000IZJZIU", "B000WZEZGI", "B0023TCWE8", "B000I0RNVQ", "B00AEFYS2M", "B001J9KJ4I", "B000AP04L0", "B001L9EXTS", "B000Y7U93C", "B00AEFZ3XU", "B001OD4S50", "B00AEFXVW0", "B00007AJGM", "B00005JNZU", "B0002V7TMY", "B000031WD9", "B000YW8RN6", "B00260HH1W", "B0016MJ6GA", "B0009P42WI", "B000063RQO", "B00005JKMN", "B002ZG97XI", "B0017JHQPK", "B000BKVQS4", "B004HO6I2E", "B0007DFJ0G", "B004SIP6LS", "B001G5T6GW", "B000M9CB4W", "B00000FA91", "B00005JMX6", "B00005V9HR", "0783230338", "B004SIP8ES", "B00AEFXIUK", "B00029RTAI", "B0009HBPN0", "B001O0TWYK", "B000K7VHOG", "B001KKU9DW", "6301964160", "B00860YIJU", "B000EGDBZ6", "630529142X", "B000J4P9P8", "B000WCN8QE", "B004I9SJH0", "B00005JMYI", "B00AEFY854", "B00003CXPS", "B00AEFYZCU", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B007D0FUTG", "B003Y5H5B0", "B000O77SF4", "B002FU8IWU", "B003PIUINS", "B00003CXWV", "B002IKIHEG", "B004SIP95G", "B008R65XNS", "B002T4GWWA", "B00AEFYAMA", "B0068MNO2U", "B000MCH5RM", "B000BO0L90", "B002ZGW92E", "B005LAIH9A", "B000G0O5I2", "0790729997", "B004EPZ084", "B00009W5F2", "B000N3SU92", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00008WJD6", "B004SEUJO6", "6305222908", "B00DW5IKYS", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B0026BXHQ0", "B00AEBBA2C", "B000OYC7BW", "B002ZG98B4", "B000FKO5QK", "B00029RTCG", "B000TZJBPQ", "B000031EFY", "B0016Q2D66", "B00AG4714S", "B0006HBZEW", "0800141687", "B00441GYVK"], "bought_together": ["B001MFNB58", "B000EMGJAO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00E8RKHWW", "B000AP04L0", "B004SEUIW4", "B000EMGJAO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 11312}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.21, "brand": "Vidmark/Trimark", "asin": "B000CPH9PM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TJVHXCPGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Waiting...

{"description": "Based on Anthony Swofford&#x92;s excellentmemoirabout his experiences as a Marine Sniper in Gulf War I,Jarheadis a war movie in which the waiting is a far greater factor upon the characters than the war itself, and the build up to combat is more drama than what combat is depicted. To some viewers hoping for typical movie action, this will seem like a cruel joke. But it&#x92;s not. It&#x92;s just the story as it was written, and if you liked the book, you will probably like the movie. If you didn&#x92;t, then the movie won&#x92;t change your mind.The movie follows the trajectory of Swofford (played with thoughtful intensity by Jake Gyllenhaal) from wayward Marine recruit (he joined because he \"got lost on the way to college\") to skilled Marine sniper, and on into the desert in preparation for the attack on Iraq. No-nonsense, Marine-for-life Staff Sgt. Sykes (Jamie Foxx), the man who recruited Swofford and his spotter Troy (Peter Sarsgaard) into the sniper team, leads them in training, and in waiting where their lives are dominated by endless tension, pointless exercises in absurdity (like playing football in the scorching heat of the desert in their gas masks so it will look better for the media&#x92;s TV cameras), more training, and constant anticipation of the moment to come when they&#x92;ll finally get to kill. When the war does come, it moves too fast for Swofford&#x92;s sniper team, and the one chance they get at a kill--to do the one thing they&#x92;ve trained so hard and waited so long for--eludes them, leaving them to wonder what was the point of all they had endured.As directed by Sam Mendes (American Beauty), the movie remains very loyal to the language and vision of the book, but it doesn&#x92;t entirely work as the film needs something more than a literal translation to bring out its full potential. Mendes&#x92;s stark and, at times, apocalyptic visuals add a lot and strike the right tone: wide shots of inky-black oil raining down on the vast, empty desert from flaming oil wells contrasted with close-ups of crude-soaked faces struggling through the mire vividly bring to life the meaning of the tagline \"welcome to the suck.\" But much of the second half of the movie will probably leave some viewers feeling disappointed in the cinematic experience, while others might appreciate its microcosmic depiction of modern chaos and aimlessness.Jarheadis one of those examples where the book is better than the movie, but not for lack of trying.--Dan Vancini", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00JRB01RK", "B00275EGWY", "B001FB55L2", "B000065U1N", "B00JRB00RG", "B000P0J09C", "B00JU949TK", "079284646X", "B002ZG97RE", "B0015D20FE", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B00001ZWUS", "B005LAIGYQ", "B00AEBBA36", "B00JA3RVG4", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B008220CQU", "B00HEPE6MM", "B00102F5WK", "B003ASLJOU", "B000095WW8", "B00AZNEW5G", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00005YUPD", "B004XQO90O", "B000Y7WGOW", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00IKM5OCO", "B00JBGSHSQ", "B00005JOFQ", "B0036RPM8Y", "B00AEBB89W", "0743244915", "B003ELKNH2", "B00JL6L4UY", "B004L3AR0K", "B00A34LX2M", "B00005PJ8T", "B004SUDQ22", "B00I4X8KXY", "B00J11U54K", "B00005JK8K", "B00J0IN6Z4", "B0034G4P30", "B00IARA8KM", "B0000AC8LR", "B000M4RG42", "B00HW3LAF2", "B00DL48BM6", "B004LGGXG4", "B0000ACOXL", "B00AEFXVCU", "B0000542CK", "B00005JLOB", "B00006JU8B", "B0000797IO", "B00JPFTS2M", "B00005U8QN", "B005LAIGRS", "B00AEBB86U", "B00HEPC0TS", "B00KDK64DY", "B00JH4SZWK", "B00IO03I6Q", "B00HWWUR02", "B001MZ5W3M", "B000KGGIZK", "B000DZ7YN8", "B00005JMXX", "B00AEBB86A", "B0007KIFGE", "B00IKM5MIA", "1558908315", "B005LAIGLE", "B001N44BVQ", "B00IJS2OHM", "B00005R87B", "B00J5JSV3A", "B00HX0KIAM", "B00ICWO144", "B00GV8B17Q", "B00JQF7ZR6", "B003UESJHO", "B00005JL5F", "B00GMV8JVI", "B00IKM5NJS", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00KNALRZ4", "B00JU94ZPS", "B00E8AVNAE", "B00HVXK15S", "B00004XPPG", "B0034G4P94", "B009POCG0Y", "B008MIL46Q", "B009AMAJPA", "B001AQO3WY", "B00HGJAPYO", "B00ALCBTWU", "B008JFUNKU"], "bought_together": ["B00275EGWY", "B000065U1N"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00275EGWY", "B00JU949TK", "B000065U1N", "B000P0J09C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15490}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.75, "brand": "VISIT MORE @ HIBISCUS EXPRESS, http://www.amazon.com/shops/AXD9LOVGJXES3", "asin": "B000DZIGDU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P2RVVCH9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jarhead (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "There was a time when the defense attorney was a heroic everyman, not the butt of bad jokes; think Atticus Finch inTo Kill a Mockingbird, and, of course, Raymond Burr's incomparable Perry Mason. The first season ofPerry Mason, which launched in 1957 on CBS, shows just how dramatic a \"law and order\" show could be. Shot in lush black and white, on film, the episodes have been lovingly restored (including lost minutes hacked from reruns to accommodate commercials). The story arcs and atmosphere feel more like film noir (Perry Mason + Philip Marlowe = separated at birth?) than early TV. The cast was stellar, including Burr's Emmy-winning Perry Mason, the indefatigable lawyer who takes tough cases no one else will touch. Burr's chemistry crackles from episode 1 with his costars, including Barbara Hale as secretary Della, William Hopper as private detective Paul Drake, and William Talman as Hamilton Burger, the well-meaning but overmatched district attorney. While it's true that the last-minute witness-stand confessions strain some credulity, the case-cracking, character development, and dialogue set a high bar for the legal shows that followed. \"The Case of the Negligent Nymph,\" for instance, involves a comely young woman--and murder suspect--fished out of the Pacific; Mason deadpans to Drake, \"Call off the search, Paul; we've landed our mermaid.\" The shows unfold at a leisurely pace, and yet don't rely on the overly expositive dialogue that, say,Law & Orderdoes; the viewer learns a lot about each case simply as it happens. The set contains the first 19 episodes of the first season and will hook you, even if you're not a procedural buff.--A.T.

{"description": "\"There's a jumper on the ledge....\" And so, after a wordless opening sequence, beginsFourteen Hours, a taut thriller about a would-be suicide standing outside his hotel-room window on St. Patrick's Day. The jumper, nervously played by Richard Basehart, is counseled by a gallery of interested parties, including a beat cop (Paul Douglas) and the man's divorced parents (Agnes Moorehead and Robert Keith) and fianc&#xE9;e (Barbara Bel Geddes). Psychiatrist Martin Gabel provides some Freudian analysis of the situation. Along with the drama on the ledge, the film cruises through the reactions of the crowd below, from concerned to cynical. Among the huge ensemble are a surprising gallery of faces, including up-and-comers Grace Kelly, Jeffrey Hunter, and Debra Paget. Howard Da Silva is a cop, and Ossie Davis and Harvey Lembeck (both uncredited) are cab drivers. Director Henry Hathaway had made some of the Fox film noirs emphasizing realism and authentic location shooting (House on 92nd Street,Call Northside 777), and he takes a similar approach to the flavorful Manhattan sites here--albeit mostly within a one-block area. The movie's ticking-clock momentum holds up well, even if some of the social-concern material feels dated. And when you can cut to a vertiginous angle every few minutes, suspense is practically guaranteed.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EXDSBG", "B000FKO3VM", "B000LN6UHI", "B000CNE08I", "B001CC7PM6", "B000CNE08S", "B001CC7PLW", "B000FKO3VW", "B000EXDSBQ", "B000B83846", "B0009X7678", "B0010KHOSU", "B0010KHOSA", "B0007ZEO7S", "B0006UEVVS", "B0007ZEO8C", "B000B8384Q", "B000CNE088", "B0010KHOSK", "B0009X766O", "B0009X7682", "B00023P4GA", "B000B8380A", "B0006UEVVI", "B0006UEVV8", "B000RXVND8", "B009X919UE", "B004C2523M", "B00023P4FQ", "B0024FAG80", "B0024FAG8A", "B00023P4G0", "B0006Z2NE0", "B00023P4II", "B00E18QKJ2", "B003NNE502", "B003G9IT3C", "B00I9BU60Q", "B00FPUN21O", "B00C3ALM02", "B0000CNY4Z", "B00012L786", "B000KJTGFG", "B008BSM1CI", "B00ICWO1LC", "B0024FAG6W", "B000F7CMQ8", "B006X0ZN3K", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B00BGARG3C", "B002YNQEF6", "B002YNQEFG", "B00006II5J", "B00005RDRL", "B00007ELD1", "B000244F2S", "B00457ZNS8", "B00005AUK9", "B00AB2NX1K", "B00004XPPK", "B00I9BU3L8", "B0089LT7ZG", "B004VA0R7Q", "B008BSM1XC", "B000087F79", "B008CZDVA6", "B000PKG7D4", "B000062XG3", "B00004W229", "B00D09AXUA", "B00AEBBA7W", "B00AEFXLKC", "B00CVB6XF2", "B00K6D1S7A", "B00EL6A7XE", "B000FI9OCW", "B00I9BU3M2", "B001SMC9L2", "B004H0M2UK", "6305999872", "B00E21D9ME", "B000BGH2HC", "B00008AOTM", "B00AEFXRWO", "B00008LDNZ", "B00005Y70Q", "B00JX3SHIC", "B0006Z2NDQ", "B0089LT800", "B00074DY0M", "B000PKG7DE", "B00AOO5OY4", "B00074DY0W", "B0052SO06A", "B00BCMSYDU", "B0002HOEQ2", "B000244EZ6", "B004LB5FEA", "B000PKG7CU", "B0012OX7DA"], "bought_together": ["B000EXDSBG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000CNE08I", "B000EXDSBG", "B001CC7PLW", "B000EXDSBQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 151558}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 21.49, "brand": "TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX HOME ENT", "asin": "B000FKO3VC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R6H8R15ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "14 Hours"}
{"description": "Season one ofPrison Breakis great television. Here's the set-up. Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell) is framed and wrongfully convicted for assassinating the Vice President's brother. Lincoln's brother Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller), who just happens to have designed Illinois' Fox River Penitentiary where Lincoln is on death row, hatches an elaborate escape plan. Michael's plan involves getting himself incarcerated in Fox River and smuggling the prison's blueprints by having them hidden in tattoos that cover his entire torso. Once inside, Michael must form alliances with a rogue's gallery of felons with their own sometimes unsavory motives. Meanwhile, on the outside, Lincoln's lawyer and one-time girlfriend Veronica Donovan (Robin Tunney), pursued by Secret Service agents, attempts to unravel the conspiracy that sent her man to the slammer.Prison Break is anchored by tight, suspenseful writing clearly relished by the largely little-known cast. Standouts include Robert Knepper as the murderer/pedophile T-Bag, who somehow makes such a despicable character likeable. Stacey Keach ofMike Hammerfame plays the warden-with-a-heart-of-gold, who clashes with Captain Brad Bellick (Wade Williams) over whether to rehabilitate the inmates or makes their lives more miserable. Peter Stormare, famous for his skills with a wood chipper in Fargo, turns in a deliciously menacing performance as mob boss John Abruzzi, while Amaury Nolasco's winsome Fernando Sucre shares a cell and secrets with Miller's Scofield. Watching the show one gets a sense that this is the opening salvo of Wentworth Miller's career, which will doubtless include roles as assassins, detectives, super heroes, and perhaps the champion of staring contests. Midway through the season it's explained that Scofield is a genius with an heightened sensitivity to other peoples' suffering, which sums up what makes the show so great--the mind-bendingly intricate plot is a framework for moments when people make others suffer and cope with the burden of their own suffering.The six-disc set includes 22 addictive episodes, audio commentary on selected episodes, three featurettes, and alternate and deleted scenes. As with most TV shows on DVD, the \"previously onPrison Break\" intros can get tiresome, but that's what the fast forward button is for. --Ryan BoudinotBeyondPrison Breakon DVDWatchBoneson DVDCatch up on24on DVDCheck outSaving Graceon DVDStills fromPrison Break- Season One (Click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000RO6JY0", "B001934SNM", "B0024F08RO", "B0024FAR4I", "B00005JNOG", "B000FIMG68", "B0012CJQYG", "B000QDLSR0", "B000NDEXK2", "B0024FAR4S", "B00194D7ZQ", "B0012CJQY6", "B000P6YNSE", "B0002XVQSU", "B00008YGRU", "B000ICLRKC", "B000B837XI", "B0018CWEYY", "B001DJLCRC", "B000NOKFGW", "B000RF1QE2", "B0024FAR5M", "B001L5SRJE", "B0012CJQZ0", "B006WNMHYG", "B000FFJYE8", "B000FVQLIO", "B0001O3YLM", "B0012CJQZA", "B0015TX2LO", "B0015ABRE2", "B002N5N5QQ", "B00274SI4C", "B000N3T0EG", "B000SQFC2C", "B0019LY5IM", "B000OIOOVE", "B001RTSPVY", "B0008JIJ1A", "B0049P1VHS", "B000Q6GUW0", "B0012CJQYQ", "B001RXDM2C", "B0079IEPHA", "B000GB75CO", "B000MR8W92", "B005GT3XD6", "B002N5N5M0", "B00EEDNR9A", "B0024FAD9C", "B003L77GH4", "B00005Y6YJ", "B00CYQXH4O", "B000V86OKG", "B000CR7RCK", "B002N5N5MK", "B000HT3P60", "B001VPJZ0E", "B001UREJXQ", "B0038M2APA", "B0036EH3XE", "B0014DO5XU", "B0081QF6Q8", "B000G6BL88", "B001QOGY54", "B003VTKZA2", "B000QUTTPG", "B009RX8MQ0", "B0060MYKYY", "B001ILFUAA", "B0015A5JVY", "B000HT3P7E", "B004YM6JLO", "B001VPJYZK", "B0032UYFAQ", "B0009IW88K", "B005LAJ22Q", "B0020TS5EM", "B000Q6GUKW", "B000YABIQ6", "B000R7GKQE", "B009NH6AOQ", "B0032UYFA6", "B003L77GRO", "B003L77GTC", "B003R0MEXQ", "B0015RRNMA", "B00J5LXT44", "B000S8CLR4", "B000FZETIE", "B000FUTVLO", "B00166UFSY", "B002ZCY7SW", "B001OQCVCE", "B002JVWRAO", "B00000FBH2", "B00IWTVDUW", "B000CNE0RO", "B0002DRE72"], "bought_together": ["B000RO6JY0", "B001934SNM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001934SNM", "B0024FAR4I", "B008P0PNOU", "B000RO6JY0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10962}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.69, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B000FKO3GW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519F139WE8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Prison Break - Season One"}

{"description": "\"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\" was clearly comedian Bob Newhart and company's motto during the fourth season (1975-76) ofThe Bob Newhart Show, all  24 episodes of which are preserved in this three-disc set. Even with the show's ratings dipping somewhat, there's no shark-jumping going on here; Newhart and producers Jay Tarses and Tom Patchett clearly understood what made this show tick, and notwithstanding a little tinkering, they stuck with it. \"It,\" of course, largely depended on Newhart himself. A brilliant reactor, he continues to bring his array of deadpan takes and brilliant, understated timing to the part of Chicago psychologist Bob Hartley, who's surrounded by the usual group of family (primarily Suzanne Pleshette as wife Emily), friends (Peter Bonerz as best bud Jerry Robinson), neighbors (Bill Daily as the tactless Howard Borden), staff (Marcia Wallace is always a riot as receptionist Carol Kester), patients (Jack Riley is the standout as the neurotic Mr. Carlin, but they're all good), and various guest stars (including Rene Auberjonois, Tom Poston, and Lawrence Pressman). Carol gets married a few episodes in, and Emily is promoted to vice-principal at her school, but these are largely cosmetic changes that do little to alter the series' overall tone.Aside from Newhart himself, props are due to the writers. As always,The Bob Newhart Show's humor is mostly low-key, with none of the raunch, tasteless sexual innuendo, and flamboyant idiocy of today's sit-coms. What's more, subjects as serious as death (\"The Longest Good-bye\" and \"Death of a Fruitman\"), obesity (\"Heavyweights,\" in which Bob presides over a workshop for \"people of the hefty persuasion\"), professional ethics (\"Who is Mr. X?\"), and jealousy on the job (\"A Matter of Vice-Principal\") are broached without ever becoming sententious or heavy-handed. Of course, three decades after the fact, some things will seem a little dated: the clothes are cringe-worthy, and it's hard to imagine anyone these days getting away with describing Beirut as a place where \"everybody looks like Danny Thomas.\" Still, Newhart's show remains one of the best of the several great sit-coms that emerged in the '70s. Bonus features include commentary (by Newhart and others) on five episodes, a gag reel, and a featurette.--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000E6ES9Y", "B000A9QKSM", "B000YKYT1M", "B000BOH8YQ", "B0011N19HI", "B003VTKZ84", "B000EXDS02", "B002WN8IR0", "B00GHH9HW2", "B00096S480", "B00HNGC56G", "B00005JLIC", "B00JHH1VUU", "B006VC3LDO", "B000G6BLDI", "B00HRUQB5O", "B00H8KC1N4", "B00KTZALDC", "B000EQ5PTQ", "B001OXLGK0", "B00FM4S7P4", "B001DHXT52", "B001O4KBN2", "B00274SIVK", "B003CNQPME", "B00GOC74QG", "B000Z27H8Q", "B000N2HD6O", "B000LXGXY8", "B002PQ7JR4", "B000NTMA1U", "B000F8O2MO", "B000291Q3O", "B000A0GOP0", "B000M343B2", "B000XJD3K2", "B0014FAIXO", "B00G5N6C8U", "B000Y7U9AK", "B000MGTQ6G", "B000BGR1B4", "B000EBGE82", "B0019BI114", "B00IF0KAYS", "B000BYRCF6", "B00BHWG0N6", "B004083REE", "B0014FAIYS", "B00FM4S8IU", "B0030BS1E8", "B000B6CODY", "B005DCJ0Q0", "B004WO9OMA", "B001GMH8WE", "B000HWZ4IY", "B006363QHE", "B0007TKG76", "B000WQWPSW", "B000G0O5J6", "B000UX6TLG", "B0009UC80Q", "B000FSME10", "B002C8YSBU", "B0001IN0BC", "B000QUEQ6I", "B0011FLGYM", "B000M343AS", "B001P9N9B2", "B0041SI7B6", "B001JTRKHW", "B009TTGLJ2", "B000PGTPC8", "B0007WFY4S", "B001JFKWE4", "B000BF0C8E", "B000CCBCCG", "B000E3L7EQ", "B00GLT2SOA", "B0001NBNIY", "B000E3L7FK", "B0031XYLR6", "B004MWLXTY", "B002E58FTM", "B001O4KBP0", "B002FLOTFO", "B0006IUDYY", "B00GLPYVT4", "B000MQ4WMY", "B00IZ27GD4", "B000H6SY28", "B0025KVNOU", "B0009IWGOG", "B00JDCP0QA", "B000TD2KY2", "B000CELOVI", "B0009UC7MK", "B00HW3LG3S", "B0006N2EZA"], "bought_together": ["B000E6ES9Y", "B000A9QKSM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000YKYT1M", "B000A9QKSM", "B00HRUQB5O", "B000E6ES9Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 36101}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "TCFHE", "asin": "B000G6BL7O", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515Y74F2MQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Bob Newhart Show: Season 4"}
{"description": "Granada Television and the PBSMystery!series'Marpleepisodes continue to delight with such distinctive vitality, wit, and stylishness one may never again think of tea rooms in the English countryside as \"quaint\" settings. Geraldine McEwan (Vanity Fair) returns as Agatha Christie's Miss Jane Marple, elderly sleuth with a keenly discerning eye and sweet smile that takes the sting out of her blunt observations of friends and murder suspects alike. As with series 1, the quartet of mysteries in series 2, set shortly after World War II, are ensemble affairs filled out by such familiar faces as Timothy Dalton, Charles Dance, Greta Scacchi, Anthony Andrews, Patricia Hodge, and Imogen Stubbs. Rather than pound out a certain visual and tonal sameness over all four stories, each 90-minute episode seems to be approached as a stand-alone affair, giving writers, directors, and production teams a lot of leeway to give each story a unique stamp.\"Sleeping Murder\" stars Sophia Myles as Gwenda Halliday, a young woman haunted by flashbacks of the memory of a killing she observed as a little girl in a stately British house. Problem is, Gwenda has only recently moved to Britain for the first time in her life, after growing up in India. Dawn French, Martin Kemp, and Geraldine Chaplin also star in the tale, which involves an old troupe of actors, a jewelry theft, and a very surprising conclusion. \"By the Pricking of My Thumbs\" concerns the disappearance of a doddering old woman who leaves behind a strange, spooky painting of a cottage in the woods, an unnerving figure lurking in the structure's window. Miss Marple is on the trail, but she allows the lonely, alcoholic wife (Scacchi) of a government investigator (Andrews) to take the lead&#x97;a boost to the younger woman's self-esteem.The ambitious \"The Moving Finger\" is the most singular episode in sries 2, a cheeky--almost subversive--vision of a rosy, picture-postcard village whose tranquility is undone by a series of hateful letters mailed to individuals in the community. Miss Marple, observing the tragic effects of these missives on relationships and reputations, is practically in the background in this story, watching closely as a nihilistic young man (James D'Arcy) comes out of his cynical, alcohol-laced haze to investigate the source of so much misery. (Bonus: director Ken Russell appears as the local, red-cheeked vicar.) Finally, \"The Sittaford Mystery\" finds Timothy Dalton playing a likely prospect to become prime minister, until he's stabbed to death following a s&#xE9;ance. Set in a rundown hotel during a severe winter storm, the episode co-stars James Murray, Rita Tushingham, and comic-actor-director Mel Smith, the latter as the late, great man's touchingly loyal, right-hand man.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000R349JI", "B0007Y3XRG", "B001UWOLQG", "B002MUAXJY", "B004VLYHNA", "B00GWXI2MC", "B00GWXHYPI", "B00GWXI0S8", "B005X5XINI", "B005X5XI4C", "B006JY3O2M", "B00EF0NYVI", "B000068UE9", "B00A0HT99G", "B00GWXI16O", "B006Z4LP9K", "B007ISJS0U", "B00DW5IKWK", "B001V7YZAM", "B00D7AM2V0", "B000CRR36K", "B005DVIPY4", "B0028AENVC", "B00CLF81Z8", "B0083HXKM2", "B004WMOSNM", "B00GHH9I62", "B009D4RW96", "B00JJRLFTU", "B00GWXI20E", "B00CEBJC84", "B004HHX9H8", "B0090XLDO0", "B009DS5OEM", "B006X202AM", "B00A27O5AW", "B00GWXI2RM", "B00GWXI1F0", "B0050N0US4", "B00CEBJC3Y", "B00GAXASKS", "B00GAH87RK", "B00IK481FO", "B001V7YZD4", "B00GAXASLC", "B00CEBJCBQ", "B001V7YZ9S", "B00ANGIAU8", "B009DS6YGO", "B00EV1YZD2", "B00HHYF548", "B001V7YZA2", "B009D4SFEC", "B008OTTTP6", "B0028AENSK", "B00C888LOO", "B00HYZ0ZLS", "B00C12ZISE", "B009DS3VQA", "B004AE3QUS", "B00A8KJLPM", "B000GB5M1K", "B00GAXASK8", "B00GWXI0M4", "B002MUAXJ4", "B00331RHPO", "B001KP2J3K", "B003YCI238", "B00HYZ10RQ", "B00BDSRM4K", "B005A1GREM", "B004HJ0ZLE", "B000199JJI", "B00D49YE4W", "B001HZ4K80", "B000R349IY", "B0028LOT7O", "B003AND1TG", "B006MK4QKW", "B003O97W2I", "B000CRR3EC", "B00GAJFJTC", "B00D49YBTA", "B001FBPSW8", "B002OMGVPU", "B00005QBZL", "B0053O8AGY", "B00CEBJCF2", "B00HW0OSPO", "B00HW0ORP0", "B006MK6Y8Y", "B000GB5M1U", "B001V7YZAC", "B006MK5YUI", "B00ANGIBV6", "B00DC5JZTW", "B00118VEH8", "B00H4ZEFTQ", "B008CYDE7C"], "bought_together": ["B000R349JI", "B0007Y3XRG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003YCI238", "B0007Y3XRG", "B001UWOLQG", "B002MUAXJY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 37322}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 31.26, "brand": "PBS", "asin": "B000GAKFIG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517436E47WL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Agatha Christie's Marple: Series 2"}

{"description": "The political becomes personal in9/11: Press for Truth, which examines the World Trade Center attacks from the perspective of the families who lost loved ones. Written and directed by Ray Nowosielski, the documentary draws partly from Paul Thompson&#x92;s website-turned-book,The Terror Timeline, and much of the commentary comes from Lorie Van Auken, Patty Casazza, and Mindy Kleinberg, three of the \"Jersey Girls.\" Along with Kristen Breitweiser, the 9/11 widows have become activists in its wake. As Casazza says, \"We all had questions...and wanted answers.\" The primary one was: How could this happen? Interestingly, two of the women voted for Bush. Casazza adds, \"Even though he should have been our biggest advocate, he turned into one of our biggest adversaries.\" Together with eight other spouses, parents, etc., they form the Family Steering Committee and lobby for an independent commission, which comes to pass, but fails to deliver the goods. The widows find more useful information in Thompson's timeline, which he compiled using material in the public domain (Thompson also appears in the film). The style of9/11: Press for Truthcouldn't be more conventional--talking heads, television footage, omniscient narrator, relentless score--but the personal approach makes it a valuable addition to the rapidly-growing list of 9/11 documentaries. The point is, to quote Patti Smith, \"people have the power\"--people like the Jersey Girls, Paul Thompson, and all the other ordinary citizens who have kept pressure on our elected officials and the news media to dig deeper and work harder.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "The talented indie director Dan Ireland (The Whole Wide World,) brings his deft, intimate touch to a lovely tale of family--and how to build one. Joan Plowright is Mrs. Palfrey, a genteel widow who moves to London to start her life anew, and to be less of a burden to her daughter. When she arrives at the dowdy Claremont Hotel, which is not quite the picture of loveliness it was in the brochure, Plowright delivers Mrs. P's quick assessment--\"Oh, dear\"--with a spot-on  mix of fleeting disappointment and stiff-upper-lip-itude. As she settles in among the oddball residents of the hotel, her life appears to be heading into a slow, downward decline. But when she meets young aspiring writer Ludovic (the adorable British actor Rupert Friend), Mrs. P--and we--learns that real family ties can be chosen, not inherited. The storyline is familiar and simple, with echoes ofTuesdays with Morrie, but the intimacy portrayed by the two lead actors brings surprising layers and emotion to the film, which envelopes the viewer like a cozy shawl. Extras include an excellent commentary with Ireland and producer Zachary Matz, Plowright's acceptance speech for an AARP award for her role in the film, and photo galleries.--A.T.

{"description": "As the title indicates,Seven Swordsis in the epic spirit ofThe Seven Samuraiand its American cousin,The Magnificent Seven. A grittier enterprise, it may not surpass Tsui Hark&#x92;s 1990s classics likeOnce Upon a Time in China, but offers its own unique pleasures--like non-stop action (for which it received a coveted Golden Horse Award). Based on the bookSeven Swordsmen from Mountain Tian, the action begins in rural China in the 1600s. The Ching Dynasty has just banned martial arts, and in response seven dissidents band together to fight against Fire-Wind (Honglei Sun) and his minions. The septet includes Hong Kong superstars Charlie Young (Wu Yuan Yin), Leon Lai (Yang Yun Chong), andHero's Donnie Yen (Chu Zhao Nan). One of the mountain villagers they save is pretty Korean refugee Green Pearl (So-yeon Kim), who falls for the moody Chu. Filmed on location in scenic Xinjiang,Seven Swordsis a feast for the eyes. Though some critics have taken Hark to task for the army's anachronistic goth-punk garb, it sure looks menacing. Originally four and a half hours long, this version clocks in at 153 minutes. Hark's soft-spoken commentary, along with Hong Kong cinema expert Bey Logan, is on the first disc. Deleted scenes and other extras are on the second. Because of the cuts, the complex narrative isn't always easy to follow--and the film still feels long--but the gold-tinged visuals and fight choreography by Kar-Leung Lau (The Legend of Drunken Master) helps to compensate.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Spanning more than six decades of Russian history encompassing the Bolshevik Revolution, Siberiade is Andrei Konchalovsky's (Runaway Train) passionate and ambitious examination of the Soviet spirit, as represented in two families of opposing ideologies: the proletariat Ustyuzhanins and the wealthy Solomins. Through their multi-generational conflicts and alliances, Konchalovsky dramatizes the evolution of the Russian people, bound together by the common struggle for survival and faithfulness to the motherland.  Yet Siberiade is more than an immense historical epic. It is a hauntingly beautiful spectacle reminiscent of the finest woks of visionary filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky (whose Andrei Roublev was co-written by Konchalovsky). Though cinematographer Levan Paatashvili's lens, the Siberian wilderness becomes a mesmerizing universe unto itself, whose forests and swamps are populated by near-mythical characters.

{"description": "Sometimes people are attracted to each other because of their differences. When there's a nebulous attraction between a teacher and a young teenage child--as in the superbHalf Nelson--the relationship has all the makings of confused disaster. Though there are a few uncomfortable moments when it's not obvious whether Dan (Ryan Gosling) and Drey (Shareeka Epps) might cross the line, the attraction between the pair is culled less from sexual tension than desperation. Dan is an idealistic history teacher in an inner-city school. Drey is one of his brightest students. For both, drugs represent something that may help them escape their worlds. He takes drugs to dull his dissatisfaction with himself. She views drugs as a possible way to better her life, even though she knows her brother's foray into that trade landed him in jail. Bleakly filmed and well told,Half Nelsonsoars because of the immaculate acting by Gosling and Epps. With his impish smile, Gosling provides a character that is at once disarming, alluring, and pitiful. As the young girl who's already seen too much hardship in her life, Epps plays her part with just the right amount of hardened raw emotion. While the ambiguous ending may not please fans weaned on happy Hollywood finales, it's a fitting and believable close to a thought-provoking film.--Jae-Ha KimStills fromHalf Nelson(click for larger image)BeyondHalf Nelsonat Amazon.comThe Films of Ryan GoslingMore Oscar Nominated Roles at the Amazon.com Oscar StoreThe Soundtrack", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004H83IG4", "B0036TGTDE", "B00049QQJ6", "B000E6ESL2", "B0014D5RBE", "B000R4SMCW", "B0060ZJ7DA", "B0064NTZQ2", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B00BEIYKM6", "B00E1LNDDU", "B0002I8372", "B00080ZGLU", "B0036TGTDO", "B003Y5H574", "B0060ZJ7AI", "B004P29LEA", "B00049QQHI", "B002A4IY3E", "B000FVQM2Y", "B005S9ELVC", "B00BEIYKSA", "B001TKK3O8", "B000683VI4", "B001E95ZNS", "B000I0QL7I", "B004H83IFA", "B000LAZDPG", "B0001EFUFK", "B002NOAFBK", "B00008K7AO", "B00A2H9QN8", "B000JBXXYK", "6305594333", "0792838068", "B00005JMJ4", "B0064NTZJO", "B000JBWWQA", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00HOGBXS6", "B003Y5H4R0", "B00K72HVBC", "6305692572", "B00A47BT7C", "B003EYVXTG", "B000AP04GK", "B00005JLRE", "B00D3LA5WG", "0859655016", "B003Y5H4W0", "B00DUX290S", "B006HGXGWU", "B00003CXKS", "B00114XTHA", "B0013XZ2QK", "B00009Y3QI", "B00005Q4CS", "B0014GI6I2", "B0013D8LCC", "B008220DGE", "B002XTXFU8", "B000YV1Q2G", "B00CX7OW1G", "B00112S8RS", "B0034G4P30", "B00AEFY17E", "B000I8OMEY", "B00094AS6I", "B00FRILRYS", "B001AS32QK", "B006OB3K56", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00A81MV3U", "B003EJO8KC", "B005KQVE1S", "B000ALM40I", "B00GMV8IVE", "B0016MOWOG", "B007REV4LQ", "B00AEFYCL4", "B00AFEXRME", "078401213X", "B00003CWTI", "B004O8OLO0", "B000YENUI6", "B004SIP7VM", "B002VECM4A", "B004QL7JYO", "B003UESJHO", "B00DW5IKYS", "B002XUBE0U", "B003Y5H57E", "B00FGVRZR4", "B00199PPP6", "B00H9KKGTO", "B000PAAJZ6", "B0082CWTSY", "B001CDFY7S", "B004H83IIC", "B0002DB52M"], "bought_together": ["B0014D5RBE", "B0036TGTDE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BEIYKM6", "B004H83IG4", "B000R4SMCW", "B0036TGTDE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 53034}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.98, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000KX0IOK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q%2BJ0%2BIGXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Half Nelson"}
{"description": "Martin Scorsese makes a welcome return to the mean streets (of Boston, in this case) withThe Departed, hailed by many as Scorsese's best film sinceCasino. Since this crackling crime thriller is essentially a Scorsese-stamped remake of the acclaimed 2002 Hong Kong thrillerInfernal Affairs, the film was intensely scrutinized by devoted critics and cinephiles, and while Scorsese's intense filmmaking and all-star cast deserve ample acclaim,The Departedis also worthy of serious re-assessment, especially with regard to what some attentive viewers described as sloppy craftsmanship (!), notably in terms of mismatched shots and jagged continuity. But no matter where you fall on the Scorsese appreciation scale, there's no denying thatThe Departedis a signature piece of work from one of America's finest directors, designed for maximum impact with a breathtaking series of twists, turns, and violent surprises. It's an intricate cat-and-mouse game, but this time the cat and mouse are both moles: Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is an ambitious cop on the rise, planted in the Boston police force by criminal kingpin Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a hot-tempered police cadet who's been artificially disgraced and then planted into Costello's crime operation as a seemingly trustworthy soldier. As the multilayered plot unfolds (courtesy of a scorching adaptation byKingdom of Heavenscreenwriter William Monahan), Costigan and Sullivan conduct a volatile search for each other (they're essentially looking for \"themselves\") while simultaneously wooing the psychiatrist (Vera Farmiga) assigned to treat their crime-driven anxieties.Such convenient coincidences might sink a lesser film, butThe Departedis so electrifying that you barely notice the plot-holes. And while Nicholson's profane swagger is too much \"Jack\" and not enough \"Costello,\" he's still a joy to watch, especially in a film that's additionally energized by memorable (and frequently hilarious) supporting roles for Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg, and a host of other big-name performers.The Departedalso makes clever and plot-dependent use of cell-phones, to the extent that it couldn't exist without them. Powered by Scorsese's trademark use of well-chosen soundtrack songs (from vintage rock to Puccini's operas),The Departedmay not be perfect, but it's one helluva ride for moviegoers, proving popular enough to become the biggest box-office hit of Scorsese's commercially rocky career.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002ZG99N6", "B000P0J09M", "B004SIP7TE", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002ZG980U", "B002VWNIEA", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEBB8NI", "B002T9H2LA", "B00005JLSB", "B000MZHW40", "B00080ZG10", "B003ASLJQS", "B000P0J0AG", "B000P0J0EW", "B000C20VPA", "B003UESJHO", "B004SIP7ZS", "B003ASLJO0", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AHTYI5M", "B00275EGWY", "B000XR9L50", "B000A3XY5A", "B0007DFJ0G", "B001N44BVQ", "B00003CXWV", "B008MILL8W", "B000286RP2", "B004SIP7VM", "B00005V9HH", "6305313687", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004FQX5B6", "B00AEFXKUI", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEBB86A", "B005LAIIJY", "B0016Q2D66", "B003ASLJQI", "B00008975Z", "B000IY04Q8", "B001P9KR8U", "B00005JNJV", "B000C20VRS", "B008R65XYC", "B005LAIGRS", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00008DP4C", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00005JN0W", "B005LAIGLE", "B000A2UBN4", "B002QEHPQU", "B000P0J0EM", "B003UESJH4", "B007D5E7C2", "6304765258", "B000P0J0D8", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00004WG2F", "0767830555", "B000LC55F2", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B004EPYZP8", "B000A7DVR2", "B00005JPD0", "B000WZEZGI", "B00049QQHI", "B000FS9FCG", "B00004XPPB", "B006OFN0SE", "B009AMAL4Y", "B004U7MR14", "B000GFLKF8", "B003AWRMCE", "B0019L770A", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B0000AM6JI", "B004SIP9Z6", "B001GZ6QC4", "0783240295", "B0010DR4BO", "B000065U1N", "B00001ZWUS", "B00BB67UNW", "B0000B1OFL", "B00AEBB9K0", "B00DHDDE32", "B00005JKWX", "B0051MKNV8", "B002ZG97RE", "0767802519", "B0034G4P94", "B00DHHWXYY", "B00005B6JZ", "B00003CXZ4", "B001TODCII"], "bought_together": ["B000P0J09M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000RETOHY", "B000P0J09M", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEBB8NI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5067}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.5, "brand": "Warner Bros", "asin": "B000M341QE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RZnzpL34L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "It takes a certain kind of comic genius to create a character who is, to quote the classic Sondheim lyric, appealing and appalling. But be forewarned:Boratis not \"something for everyone.\" It arrives as advertised as one of the most outrageous, most offensive, and funniest films in years. Kazakhstan journalist Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen reprising the popular character from hisDa Ali G Show), leaves his humble village to come to \"U.S. and A\" to film a documentary. After catching an episode ofBaywatchin his New York hotel room, he impulsively scuttles his plans and, accompanied by his fat,hirsute producer (Hardy to his Laurel), proceeds to California to pursue the object of his obsession, Pamela Anderson.Boratis not about how he finds America; it's about how America finds him in a series of increasingly cringe-worthy scenes. Borat, with his '70s mustache, well-worn grey suit, and outrageously backwards attitudes (especially where Jews are concerned) interacts with a cross-section of the populace, catching them, a la Alan Funt onCandid Camera, in the act of being themselves. Early on, an unwitting humor coach advises Borat about various types of jokes. Borat asks if his brother's retardation is a ripe subject for comedy. The coach patiently replies, \"That would not be funny in America.\" NOT! Borat is subversively, bracingly funny. When it comes to exploring uncharted territory of what is and is not appropriate or politically correct, Borat knows no boundaries, as when he brings a fancy dinner with the southern gentry to a halt after returning from the bathroom with a bag of his feces (\"The cultural differences are vast,\" his hostess graciously/patronizingly offers), or turns cheers to boos at a rodeo when he calls for bloodlust against the Iraqis and mangles \"The Star Spangled Banner.\"Success, John F. Kennedy once said, has a thousand fathers. A paternity test onBoratmight reveal traces of Bill Dana's Jose Jimenez, Andy Kaufman, Michael Moore,The Jamie Kennedy Xperiment, andJackass. Some scenes seem to have been staged (a game Anderson, whom Borat confronts at a book signing, was reportedly in on the setup), but others, as the growing litany of lawsuits attests, were not. All too real is Borat's encounter with loutish Southern frat boys who reveal their sexism and racism, and the disturbing moment when he asks a gun store owner what gun he would recommend to \"kill a Jew\" (a Glock automatic is the matter-of-fact reply). Comedy is not pretty, and inBoratit can get downright ugly, as when Borat and his producer get jiggly with it during a nude fight that spills out from their hotel room into the hallway, elevator, lobby and finally, a mortgage brokers association banquet. High-five! --Donald LiebensonOn the DVD\"Global Visitings\" capturesBorat-mania in all its hype and glory, as Sacha Baron Cohen, never breaking character, promotes his film around the world. On the itinerary isLate Night with Conan O'Brienand the Toronto Film Festival, a now-legendary screening aborted after a projector malfunction. A mixed bag of deleted scenes finds Borat trying to bait more unsuspecting citizens, including an animal-control worker who refuses Borat a dog after he asks, \"How do you recommend I cook this?\" and a doctor who is nonplussed by Borat's obscene medical history. A supermarket visit offers the most maddening fromage-inspired looniness since Monty Python's \"Cheese Shop\" sketch. Also good for a few chuckles are a faux soundtrack commercial and aBaywatchparody (\"Sexydangerwatch\").--Donald LiebensonBeyondBoratAll things Sacha Baron CohenBoratApparelBoratSoundtrackStills fromBorat(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002P7UCJ0", "B005LAIHGI", "B0002ZMITY", "B002OID4WM", "B00020X852", "B000A88ESW", "B000WZEZGI", "B001G5T6GW", "B005LAIHHC", "B00AEFZ8OY", "B002P7UCJA", "B00005JNZU", "B001DPHDB0", "B001J9KJ4I", "B00G2P79BU", "B000J4QW8Q", "B00AEFYS2M", "B00005JMYI", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B0006GANPA", "B001OD4S50", "6305922756", "B003XJABTK", "B00AEBBA2C", "B008R65XNS", "B000BKVQS4", "B00AEBB9K0", "B003CRM6PA", "B000A7DVR2", "B00AEBB8FQ", "B0016MOV92", "B000BKJ762", "B00009W5CA", "B000AP04L0", "B008220BGQ", "B002T9H2LA", "B00068WOH8", "0385523467", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00008975Z", "B004SIP95G", "B00003CXZ1", "0783229526", "B002ZG99N6", "B003VPX5Y4", "B002SJIO4A", "B00005JLQN", "B00AEFY854", "B00005O3VC", "B004XVMCH6", "B000K7VHQE", "B0006HBZEW", "B00005JMUA", "B000VE439Y", "B00AEFXDO6", "B000EMGJAO", "B0000A02TZ", "B00005JNBQ", "B003Y5H5B0", "B00BEIYMZ6", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000MCH5RM", "B000K7VHOG", "B00005ALS0", "B001UV4X8S", "B00009MGEM", "B0001Z4OXS", "B000C20VPA", "B0012IWNZY", "B00CE00ZV8", "B00005QCVX", "B000I0RNVQ", "B000022TSW", "B001TOD92C", "B000P0J09M", "B00005JL78", "B00AEFYAMA", "B00AEFXGIY", "B000J4P9P8", "B000055Y0X", "B004EPZ084", "B001VLBDD0", "B00AEFY5B6", "B006XZWAWM", "B00005JKMN", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000XFVIOO", "B002GSXKOW", "B00006G8HR", "B000HT386M", "B000MQCUJG", "B00007AJF7", "B00005KA6V", "B004SIP9MY", "B00AEBBA72", "B00018D42W", "B000TZJBPQ", "B0009HBPN0", "B004P9UWM8"], "bought_together": ["B005LAIHGI", "B002P7UCJ0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005LAIHGI", "B000WZEZGI", "B002OID4WM", "B000TZJBPQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15271}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.29, "brand": "COHEN,SACHA BARON", "asin": "B000MMMT9G", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51uGbGa68JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"}
