{"description": "Grab an econo-pack of tissues, gather your loved ones around a cozy  television, and bring on the hot cocoa--it's time for a dose of Christmas  spirit. The tender and charming Mary Steenburgen (Parenthood) dons a sour disposition in her role as Ginny Grainger, a woman who finds little joy in life  lately--let alone in the impending holiday season. Money is tight, her  husband (beautifully downplayed by nice-guy Gary Basaraba) lost his job,  and the family must move out of their house. Ginny cannot even bring  herself to say, \"Merry Christmas,\" despite her family's enthusiasm about  the big day. With help from Ginny's brave and loving daughter (sweetly  performed by Elisabeth Harnois) and a Christmas angel named Gideon (Harry Dean  Stanton), Ginny undergoes a life-altering experience &agrave; laIt's a Wonderful Life. The result? Happy endings, hugs and  kisses, pass the tissues.Not a light holiday entertainer by any means, the plot verges on  depressing at times, as the family struggles through money issues and the  tedium of daily suburban survival. While handled fairly subtly, some of  the bridging story--including a shooting, a kidnapping, and a  drowning--might prove disturbing to children under 6 years old. And  really: if the somber Harry Dean Stanton (Paris, Texas) repeatedly  appeared in your neighborhood, cloaked in a cowboy hat and overcoat,  would you allow your kids outside? Still, a well-made favorite to  cherish.--Liane Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301752627"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 392357}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.77, "brand": "", "asin": "0764007211", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CE6WPRT4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "One Magic Christmas [VHS]"}

As a child in Japan, Nagiko's father celebrates her birthday retelling the Japanese creation myth and writing on her flesh in beautiful calligraphy, while her aunt reads a list of \"beautiful things\" from a 10th-century pillow book. As she gets older, Nagiko (Vivian Wu) looks for a lover with calligraphy skills to continue the annual ritual. She is initially thrilled when she encounters Jerome (Ewan McGregor), a bisexual translator who can speak and write several languages, but soon realizes that although he is a magnificent lover, his penmanship is less than acceptable. When Nagiko dismisses the enamored Jerome, he suggests she use his flesh as the pages which to present her own pillow book. The film, complete with a musical score as international as the languages used in the narration, is visually hypnotic and truly an immense \"work of art.\"--Michele Goodson", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 404904}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.9, "brand": "", "asin": "0767801962", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513BM3E52RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Pillow Book [VHS]"}

Harrison Ford plays a U.S. president who single-handedly employs his rigid antiterrorism policy when a band of Russian thugs hatch a mid-flight takeover of Air Force One. Gary Oldman, who chews the scenery as the lead terrorist, will shoot a hostage at the slightest provocation. Glenn Close plays the sternly pragmatic vice president who negotiates with Oldman from her Washington seat of power. If you can believe that the aircraft's pressurized cabin can sustain hundreds of rounds of machine-gun fire, you'll buy anything in this entertaining potboiler, especially thanks to Ford's stalwart heroics and some nifty special effects.

{"description": "As \"gigantic monster reptile attacks New York\" movies go, you've got to admit thatGodzilladelivers the goods, although its critical drubbing and box-office disappointment were arguably deserved. It's a shameless, uninspired crowd pleaser that's content to serve up familiar action with the advantage of really fantastic special effects, and if you expect nothing more you'll be one among millions of satisfied customers. There's really no other way to approach it--you just have to accept the fact thatIndependence Daycreators Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin are unapologetic plagiarists, incapable of anything more than mindless spectacle that can play in any cinema in the world without dubbing or subtitles. The whole movie plays out like a series of highlights stolen from previous blockbusters of the 1990s; it's little more than a rehash of theJurassic Parkmovies. The derivative script is so trivial that it's unworthy of comment, apart from a few choice laughs and the casting of Michael Lerner as New York's mayor, whose name is Ebert and who closely resembles a certain well-known movie critic. Perhaps that's a clever hint that this movie's essentially critic-proof. It's stupid but it's fun, and for most audiences that's a fitting definition of mainstream Hollywood entertainment. The widescreen Special Edition DVD includes a wealth of bonus materials--audio commentary by the film's special effects supervisors, a \"making of\" featurette, the Wallflowers' music video \"Heroes,\" a photo gallery, and a variety of features related to this and all the classicGodzillafilms from Japan.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00003CXLS", "B000P24FAE", "B000VXWK86", "B000H30B2C", "B0000VAGXU", "B00066KWCY", "B00I462X7K", "B00003L9CB", "B0001AVZ9Y", "0767825489", "B00I462Y60", "B0000VAGXK", "B0006SGYLK", "B00I099JZK", "B00I462XF2", "B000MV8AJK", "B0088FS1DC", "B009ERJY6G", "B00IE41A9O", "B00AEFYEU8", "B000BMY2L0", "B00K2CHW48", "B00003L9CE", "B00E8G5HQE", "B0002V7OI8", "B00125WAYQ", "0767802497", "B00JB08O76", "B005VU9LO0", "B00008G8M4", "B000E1BXFG", "B001AR0D40", "B000MV8AJU", "B0087ZG7J8", "B007WETMRY", "B000OCY7IU", "6305320950", "B000OCY7IK", "B00125WAYG", "B0087ZG7NO", "B000EHQTZO", "B0093QC3SY", "B001YYQ9S8", "B00B2M7DKA", "B00005A8XX", "B00I099JO6", "B00I3C1T6G", "B00006FD9K", "B007STBUHI", "B002GHHHL0", "B00008WFU4", "B00005R1O7", "B00AEFXPMG", "0783225547", "B00000G3PA", "B00003CXTA", "B00005O5B5", "B0041N72PI", "B00BG4RKL6", "B000OVLBHG", "B0002IQLH6", "B00IQAUO48", "B00IQAUO5C", "B00005JNTI", "B00005JMXX", "B00008WFU5", "B0088FS27C", "B0002B15WY", "B0087ZG7HK", "B0045HCJ0S", "B0024FAG2G", "B000ASATZ8", "B00260HH3K", "B004XVMCN0", "B000F6IOC0", "B00008G8M5", "0780622650", "B000B7MX6Q", "0783231644", "B0068FZ0O2", "B00IQAUO6Q", "B00IQAUO2A", "B00AEFYSR2", "0790738511", "B008JFUPFI", "B00AEFYXQI", "B000R1A0LG", "B000RXVNDI", "B002HTCOCO", "B000056PMU", "B009MF5BXK", "B005G4TJUC", "B0045HCJ9O", "B0006HBZYC", "B000IJ79UW", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B005VU9LKE", "B00IAO618S", "B000BYY11Y", "B000EHSVPK"], "bought_together": ["B000P24FAE", "B000VXWK86"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CXLS", "B00K2CHW48", "B0034G4ORC", "B00177YA1K"]}, "price": 6.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8109}, "asin": "0767817478", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51xvBMPeK6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Godzilla"}

{"description": "Wild Thingsis the kind of lurid, trashy thriller that you'll either dive into with unabashed pleasure or turn away from in prudish disgust; it's entirely your choice, but we suggest the former option since it's obviously much more fun. The plot's so convoluted it's hardly worth describing, except to say that it's set in humid Florida and involves a respected high school teacher (Matt Dillon--yes, Matt Dillon as a teacher!) who is faced with accusations of rape by a student (Denise Richards, fromStarship Troopers) who had been giving him the kind of attention most people would consider improper for such a \"nice\" young lady. Another student (Neve Campbell) raises a similar charge against the teacher, and that's when a police officer (Kevin Bacon) begins to investigate the allegations. Just when you think the movie's gone overboard with its shameless sex and absurdly twisted plot, in drops Bill Murray as an unscrupulous lawyer (of course) to spice things up with insurance scams and welcomed comic relief. As directed by John McNaughton (who has a way of making just the right moves with this kind of film noir melodrama),Wild Thingsis a bona fide guilty pleasure--the kind of movie you may be ashamed to enjoy, but what the heck, you'll enjoy it anyway.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000PMFS2I", "B003CPPY6K", "B0045HCIYA", "B0002KPIQY", "B0001GF2BA", "B000HT38EO", "B00001PE4D", "B000E5N684", "B00E8G5HXM", "B000BX0VT6", "B00827OWO8", "B00AEFYD2M", "B000EQ5SRK", "B001URA5Y8", "B0045O2PHS", "B000HC2LHG", "078322933X", "B0037QGS0A", "B00013RC66", "B002AS463W", "B006M3M5FM", "0767824954", "B00005V4XV", "B000BBOUUE", "B000EZ9084", "B001CRC4DG", "0780627776", "B000087F7E", "B00006RCNY", "B00008972P", "B005XB8T68", "B00441GYVK", "B000FS9UKI", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B00008L3S6", "B00049QJBG", "B00003CXKA", "6305428484", "B00005YU1M", "B000GI3KGC", "B00005JMWP", "B00000JDIQ", "076782170X", "B00029RTCG", "B0014D5R9G", "B0009R1TI6", "B001LMU1NC", "B000FIHN5M", "B0002DB54A", "B0043X1FNQ", "B00006L91I", "0783222149", "B00004W4UD", "B0040J1RX6", "B000NO39FG", "B00003CY1G", "B00003CXUP", "B00003CY0V", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B00AEFXBPM", "B001AIQ14A", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B00AEFYD9K", "B003M05KU0", "B008FYZHDI", "6305017115", "B0000ZMGWK", "0790730979", "B00003CXMP", "B00005JH9M", "B00007ELEQ", "B00GPPXNIK", "0767807588", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B002Q3MZXE", "B001JV5BIA", "B00000F0AD", "B004SEUJXM", "B004SUDQC2", "B00IKM5OCO", "B004EPYZP8", "B00005QJIG", "B0006GANPA", "B000035Z5G", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00003CXLD", "B00004XPPI", "B00004RF85", "B00JJ3EHCG", "6305308837", "B00005V9HH", "B0029Z8K74", "B00005JMIJ", "B000PAAJZ6", "B00AEFXJ86", "B0010SAGHS"], "bought_together": ["B000PMFS2I", "B0045HCIYA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BX0VT6", "B000PMFS2I", "B003CPPY6K", "B000E5N684"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 197842}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.49, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "0767816234", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FBK83D9FL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wild Things"}

{"description": "Rose McGowan vamps it up mercilessly as the \"Satan in heels,\" a teenage-bitch queen whose birthday prank gone terminally wrong leaves her best friend dead, choked to death on a jawbreaker the size of a fist. Rebecca Gayheart, with her sparkling eyes and a smile that could melt an iceberg, is the good girl at heart who becomes a social pariah when she drops out of the group, trading her plunging necklines for librarian-lite sweaters and long skirts.Jawbreakerwants nothing less than to be theHeathersof its generation, but only intermittently hits the mark, such as when McGowan turns a mousy nobody into the next big thing, a slutty tease whose craving for attention soon challenges McGowan's supremacy. \"She's evil,\" someone finally realizes, \"and she's only in high school!\" That's unfortunately the best Darren Stein's film gets. For all its catty talk and surface glamour, it's a flat, broadly directed satire that never lives up to its evocative title.

{"description": "If Franz Kafka had been an animator and film director--oh, and a member of Monty Python's Flying Circus--this is the sort of outrageously dystopian satire one could easily imagine him making. However,Brazilwas made by Terry Gilliam, who is all of the above except, of course, Franz Kafka. Be that as it may, Gilliam sure captures the paranoid-subversive spirit of Kafka'sThe Trial(along with his own Python animation) in this bureaucratic nightmare-comedy about a meek governmental clerk named Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce) whose life is destroyed by a simple bug. Not a software bug, a real bug (no doubt related to Kafka's famousMetamorphosisinsect) that gets smooshed in a printer and causes a typographical error unjustly identifying an innocent citizen, one Mr.&nbsp;Buttle, as suspected terrorist Harry Tuttle (Robert De&nbsp;Niro). When Sam becomes enmeshed in unraveling this bureaucratic glitch, he himself winds up labeled as a miscreant.The movie presents such an unrelentingly imaginative and savage vision of 20th-century bureaucracy that it almost became a victim of small-minded studio management itself--until Gilliam surreptitiously screened his cut for the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, who named it the best movie of 1985 and virtually embarrassed Universal into releasing it. This DVD version of Brazil is the special director's cut that first appeared in Criterion's comprehensive (and expensive) six-disc laser package in 1996.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004ALIG0G", "B0011E5M66", "B003XURDAY", "B00000K3TS", "B000934FC2", "B0007PALZ2", "B0000CDUT5", "B001HN69AY", "B000KB4898", "B0043X1FM2", "B0018O4YT0", "0783228457", "B000BR9S96", "078401213X", "B001FOK70S", "0783229526", "B0040QYROA", "B00006CXGZ", "B0002CHIKG", "B00005JKJA", "B00007AJF8", "B000F5GNX8", "B000VE439Y", "B002IVDLGY", "B001WLMOL4", "B000055Y0X", "B004NWPY20", "B00005QAPH", "B00008RH3J", "B00000ING2", "B0007GAG42", "B000063JDE", "B0048LPRCS", "B002E01MBA", "B003102JDM", "B000E5LEV0", "B0045HCJSU", "B001CW7ZT4", "B000TXNDV6", "B001IHJ988", "B004L9GMBC", "B00006RCNV", "B005KQVE1S", "B000093NQZ", "B0000AOX0F", "B001152TL6", "1557833478", "B0050FXDDQ", "B00000IC7G", "B0000VD04M", "B00AEFXN9G", "B000274TLW", "0790742047", "B002LFPBLU", "B0057ZAA6W", "B006TTC5MM", "B002Y2BDEE", "B004ALIG4M", "B000N6TX1I", "0800195175", "B000UJ48SQ", "B000286RR0", "0792838300", "B004SUDQ72", "B000CNESU8", "B00000F3CD", "0767830555", "B00005JKPT", "B0045NXMJE", "B00065GX64", "B00004Y87O", "B001B1UO7G", "B001BEK8E2", "B00005B1ZL", "B0009X768W", "B004FQX5B6", "B00005UQ7T", "B0007UC8Y4", "B00004TJKI", "B00166UFA2", "B00003CWTI", "B00005AUKD", "B00005O3VC", "B003ELKNH2", "B000G8NXYG", "B000PAAJZ6", "B002U6DVPS", "B000059HAE", "0792841409", "B000QQH52Y", "6305428107", "B00005JMJ4", "B000A2UBNE", "B004SIP86Q", "0780022041", "B00BJC8OJ2", "6305257450", "B00005AUK9", "B00007CVS2", "B00023P4N8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000UBMSB8", "B004ALIG0G", "B0002CHK1S", "B00H9L26AA"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 74845}, "asin": "0780022181", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WB6PY4HZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Brazil (The Criterion Collection 3-Disc Boxed Set)"}

{"description": "The premise sounds great but the promise is never fulfilled. Terrence McNally's Tony Award-winning hit about a cluster of gay male friends who gather several times one summer at a Victorian house on the bank of a rural lake never quite measures up (at least on film) as anything particularly profound. The story traces a history of infighting and changing relationships within the group, with the shock of AIDS slowly pushing everyone toward greater closeness and honesty. But instead of making an impact, so much of the film is trivial: dinner conversations are banal, tantrums are tedious, genitals are a little too overexposed. The two best and most familiar actors in the piece, Jason Alexander and John Glover, ironically play the most clich&eacute;-ridden characters.

{"description": "When it was released in 1998,Passion in the Desertwas largely dismissed by critics, many of whom derided the film as silly, pretentious, or altogether misguided by first-time director Lavinia Currier. It's a pity, because this is the kind of mesmerizing, mostly nonverbal film that weaves its own particular spell on receptive viewers. Based on a novella by the great French writer Honor&eacute; de Balzac and set in Egypt in 1798, the story focuses on Augustin (played by British actor Ben Daniels), a soldier in Napoleon's army who is separated from his unit and lost in the desert. There he encounters a female leopard and, as the title suggests, the film daringly develops a relationship between man and beast--a relationship that may push the boundaries of credibility for many viewers, but which works in the strange, otherworldly context of the story. It's best to accept the film on its own terms--a film about a man reduced to his purest basic instincts, or a parable that should not be confused for any kind of literal reality. Otherwise, the film will surely seem as odd and silly as  naysaying critics said it was.As a rookie director (after directing theater and working for the Merchant-Ivory production team), Currier seems uncertain of precisely what kind of film she's attempting, and the result is uneven in its narrative thrust. ButPassion in the Desertis triumphant as a sensual and sensory experience, casting its spell through magnificent cinematography (on locations in Petra, Jordan and Moab, Utah), and the purity of its visual narrative. Obviously chosen for his own feline features, Daniels deserves credit for playing so convincingly with his sleek, spotted co-star (actually, three leopards were used during filming), and the leopard itself is majestically graceful and fascinating to watch. This is a film to be savored not as a rich and altogether satisfying story (which bears thematic resemblance toWalkabout), but as a film full of magical moments, hypnotic in its beauty and its depiction of nature, both soothing and savage.--Jeff Shannon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 465151}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 17.88, "brand": "", "asin": "0780624386", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517W36Y3YFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Passion in the Desert [VHS]"}

{"description": "The mind-bending worlds of author H.P. Lovecraft have long interested horror directors, but the films have rarely successfully captured his nightmarish mix of madness and mythology. John Carpenter'sIn the Mouth of Madnessis not directly based on Lovecraft's work, but screenwriter Michael De Luca draws his inspiration from Lovecraft's Cthulu mythology and then adds his own ingenious twists. John Trent (Sam Neill), an insurance investigator recently fitted for a straightjacket, tells his story to a psychiatrist. Hired to track down the missing pop-horror phenomena Sutter Cane, a Stephen King-like author whose fans are literally made for his books, Trent finds the supposedly fictional Hobb's End.  He watches the town collapse into madness, murder, and monstrous transformations: the fantastic horrors of Cane's novels played out in front of his eyes. \"Reality isn't what it used to be,\" deadpans one zombielike townsperson. In fact, it is how Cane writes it--but is he Devil, dark oracle, or simply a preacher in the service of an evil that grows stronger with every soul his books convert? The script never quite gets a grip on the blurry relationship between fact and fiction, but those details fade in the face of Carpenter's demented imagery, shiver-inducing twists, and dark wit. It's more eerie mind game than straight-out horror, a portrait of a world gone mad, and Carpenter relishes every hallucinatory moment.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000AOX0A", "0792839706", "B000RPCK2O", "B000067J0M", "B0085X315U", "B003V6XDP4", "B00AEFXW8I", "B000AM6OQ2", "B00005K3OC", "B0002CHK1S", "B000BQTC98", "B00B8O4WQA", "B0024FADBA", "B005OT810I", "B008CYDD7I", "B003TRMLQM", "B0000AOX0F", "B00008974J", "B00006AUIG", "0783116926", "B00KH57THK", "B0000DC12T", "B0009298N4", "B000MV8ABS", "B006LMRMMA", "B0053TWW9K", "6304936532", "B00009YXHN", "B00JQYV0B4", "B004EI2NPO", "B001B8XRT6", "B008874968", "B0000AOX09", "B00AGKH4MG", "B00009WNXA", "B00FYV7WCY", "B0000AOX0E", "B00009PY2T", "B002I41KNC", "B00J0IN6Z4", "B00FXOO1VC", "B002HML6YI", "B0024FAG44", "B000TZJCMS", "B0009X75J2", "157362408X", "B00004Y87O", "B000MV8AC2", "B000RPCJA2", "B000S0GYRU", "B002GHHHG0", "0783228457", "B008WAM2E2", "B00DOZNGTK", "B00D7AM6M0", "B000HEWEGC", "B00BTYPW7C", "B00005O439", "B000F3UA8E", "B00005KH30", "B001AGNMFI", "B00009OWI1", "6305258287", "B0053TWW36", "B0001ZX0GK", "B0002S9QUA", "B00IA1VKVY", "B0001XAKUQ", "B009EUVXZI", "0792841328", "B0002C9DK4", "B004EI2NP4", "B000QUCQX8", "B00005NRN6", "B00009MEC4", "B00003CY6P", "B001D5C1OO", "B000MV8ZCW", "B00006CXGP", "B006QWC2ZC", "B00G5GNYY2", "B0067QPVJ6", "B0001LQJMQ", "B000IJ7A5Q", "8598310042", "B00J81S92S", "B00023P4TM", "B000WC389G", "0790742829", "B000TUDBFC", "B0007WQHI0", "B00EZ50SGW", "B001J710Y8", "B0001611DI", "B002LMSWN2", "B00DBPBOZG", "B0014VPFVS", "B0053TWVIM", "B000MDFTHE"], "bought_together": ["B0000AOX0A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000AOX0A", "B0000AOX0F", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B000AM6OQ2"]}, "price": 27.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 56503}, "asin": "078062856X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/411R7MSBQ1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "In the Mouth of Madness"}

{"description": "Steven Spielberg's 1993 mega-hit rivalsJawsas the most intense and frightening film he'd ever made prior toSchindler's List, but it was also among his weakest stories. Based on Michael Crichton's novel about an island amusement park populated by cloned dinosaurs, the film works best as a thrill ride with none of the interesting human dynamics of Spielberg'sJaws. That lapse proves unfortunate, but there's no shortage of raw terror as a rampaging T-rex and nasty raptors try to make fast food out of the cast.

{"description": "Director Martin Scorsese reunites with members of hisGoodFellasgang (writer Nicholas Pileggi; actors Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Frank Vincent) for a three-hour epic about the rise and fall of mobster Sam &quot;Ace&quot; Rothstein (De Niro), a character based on real-life gangster Frank &quot;Lefty&quot; Rosenthal. (It's modeled after onWiseguyandGoodFellasand Pileggi's true crime bookCasino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas.)  Through Rothstein, the picture tells the story of how the Mafia seized, and finally lost control of, Las Vegas gambling. The first hour plays like a fascinating documentary, intricately detailing the inner workings of Vegas casinos. Sharon Stone is the stand out among the actors; she nabbed an Oscar nomination for her role as the voracious Ginger, the glitzy call girl who becomes Rothstein's wife. The film is not as fast paced or gripping as Scorsese's earlier gangster pictures (Mean StreetsandGoodFellas), but it's still absorbing. And, hey--it's Scorsese!--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000P0J09M", "B000C20VRS", "B00004XPPB", "B000P0J0AG", "B0000AM6JI", "B0006GAOJA", "B0019L770A", "B0019L21GA", "B00003CXWV", "0767830555", "B000286RP2", "B0018CMJSU", "B000M341QE", "B004SIP7TE", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AEBB9NM", "B00004U103", "B0000DI87S", "B00008975Z", "B00013RC2U", "B00CCMKPO0", "B0019L21H4", "B000A2UBN4", "B006TTC5HC", "B004SIP95G", "B007TBIUSM", "B002QEHPQU", "B000H5TH20", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005V9HH", "B00G1C2URC", "B00011CZRE", "B002VWNIEA", "B002T9H2LA", "B0000AMJEK", "B0001FGBUW", "B000P0J0EW", "B000A7DVR2", "6305313687", "B004G7XCRQ", "B000P0J0D8", "B000LP6KNU", "B0007DFJ0G", "1558908390", "B000P0J09C", "B00080ZG10", "B00005B6JZ", "B000CNESTE", "B004FQX5B6", "B000067IZ3", "B004U7MR14", "0783229526", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00008RH3L", "B0018CWW5K", "B002CA68N4", "B00562D3Y2", "B006X08FGW", "B007D5E7C2", "B000SFOW8I", "B008R65XYC", "B00005ATQB", "B00001ZWUS", "B000EHSVRI", "B00AEFXESQ", "B0009A40ES", "B002ZG99N6", "B003ELKNH2", "B000OT6V0K", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000002OZ9", "B000MZHW40", "B00AEFXKUI", "B004L9GMBC", "B00006RCNV", "B000PAAJZ6", "B001JIE7JC", "B00AEBB95K", "B004SIP93S", "B000E5KQHI", "B00IEK9U0E", "B0000AMRJE", "B000ZM1MGE", "B000QEIOT4", "B0041QSZS8", "B000093FLA", "B0000YEE6M", "B002VWNIDG", "B00029RTAI", "B002NZK5QO", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00079Z9VO", "B00AEBB8LA", "B007SPPANM", "B000035Z5G", "B00004XPPG", "079284646X", "B000FI8MPW", "B003AWRMCE", "B00AEFY0F2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000P0J09M", "B000C20VRS", "B008R65XYC", "B000M341QE"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 158336}, "asin": "0783225792", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/712YQJ017YL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Casino"}

{"description": "\"One gasbag meets another\" is how critic Pauline Kael described the \"flatulent seriousness\" that director Robert Wise brought to this 1975 thriller about the ill-fated German zeppelin which exploded while landing in New Jersey in 1937. The great air disaster is speculatively depicted here as an act of sabotage, and the airship's trans-Atlantic journey gives the saboteur's plot plenty of time to unfold while the story introduces a variety of characters aboard for the luxurious flight. While the anti-Nazi message is delivered loud and clear, Anne Bancroft and George C. Scott lead an illustrious cast in what amounts to a pre-World War II episode ofThe Love Blimp,only there's not much romance and precious little suspense. It's all rather flatly intriguing, but aviation buffs will certainly appreciate the meticulous attention to period detail, and the film won special achievement Oscars for its impressive sound and visual effects.

{"description": "Let's face facts here: You don't watch a movie likeMajor Paynefor its artistic merit any more than you'd watchSchindler's Listfor its comedy. If you go in thinking otherwise, you're bucking for a disappointment. So it's a pleasant surprise to discover thatMajor Payneis more entertaining than a barrel full of bad reviews would lead you to believe. It's a totally formulaic comedy about a bunch of misfit kids who turn into a crack squad of skillfully disciplined ROTC cadets, but Damon Wayans is spot-on hilarious in the title role as the hardened military bulldog who whips the little slackers into shape. Wayans plays the role as if killing and warfare were the only joys in life, and when he finds himself cast adrift without a military commission, a scene that directly parodiesApocalypse Nowlets you know that Wayans (who cowrote the script) is going to bring something new to this routine scenario. Major Payne's idea of a good bedtime story is to recall his worst battlefield horrors, and Wayans gives it just the right twist of comedy to put Payne's bullet-pierced heart in the right place--he's really just a good guy with an iron-clad exterior. The young recruits strut their stuff in the final round of their cadet competition (their marching rap is good for a solid laugh), and director Nick Castle keeps it all from becoming too stupid or over the top. It's arguably only for Wayans's most ardent fans, but as a send-up of all the great movie drill instructors,Major Payneis painlessly enjoyable.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305433925", "B00E8G5HZ0", "B00008L3W3", "B00008L3S9", "6305428549", "B000089778", "B00BLN4V46", "0783227345", "B00005T30A", "B0000WN0UU", "B000068QPM", "B00007GZRP", "6305428387", "B000CEPE5A", "B00AEFXPG2", "0783225504", "B00003CXPS", "155890834X", "B00008977A", "B00008977B", "6305236569", "B0006J28MI", "B00003GPFT", "B002GOAH1A", "B0019PL2QG", "B00E1HIX66", "B0000639HQ", "B000031EFY", "B00003CXRM", "B00081912E", "0783219806", "B00175VSBC", "B000TLOMPE", "B00AEBB9AA", "B00009Y3RC", "B000HT386M", "B00000IQW4", "B0000633U2", "B002DKGWSE", "B0014BQR7Y", "B001MVYUR0", "B0045HCJRG", "0783226896", "B00AEFYFWA", "B000F6ZIIS", "B000VG66XS", "630529142X", "B0000DZTNB", "B0021L8UPS", "B004GJYROG", "0780631234", "B0034GK78W", "B00005JL93", "B000AP04FG", "B00AEFXEGS", "B000056VP4", "B003NH6FY2", "B00AEBB9GY", "B000FOPPDI", "B00AEBB9DM", "B00005PJ6N", "B000AXWHSA", "B002VWNICM", "B00DW5IL92", "B004SIP8ES", "B0045HCJGC", "B00193F304", "B0009RCPUW", "B000P0J09W", "B004GJYRF0", "B00008979O", "B004KPLVWC", "B001MWUWU8", "B0000VV512", "B00E1HIWU8", "B001KKU9DM", "B00AEFY3MC", "B00006SFL7", "B00000G3PA", "B00177YFYM", "B0002VYOVI", "B00C7MW5HU", "B000089771", "B0007LLPXI", "B000P0J09C", "B00AEFYPXY", "B000IFRT4W", "B002CA68MU", "B008R65XYC", "B00267QOEQ", "0800177258", "B002O3Z4YI", "B0007LXPBI", "B004H83INW", "B00AKGG6X4", "B003Y5H5B0", "B000M9CB4W", "0783237367", "0783231644", "B0001AW14C"], "bought_together": ["B00E8G5HZ0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000N4RARE", "6305433925", "B000089778", "B0019PL2PM"]}, "price": 7.5, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3359}, "asin": "0783230494", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XWYH5A4ZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Major Payne"}
{"description": "Unlike most \"message\" films which date themselves almost immediately, Lewis Milestone's low-key unpolished and deeply-felt screen adaptation of the Erich Maria Remarque anti-war novel has lost little of its original impact. Years after its release it was still being banned in countries mobilizing for war. The plot follows a group of young German recruits in World War I through their passage from idealism to disillusionment. As the central character Paul Baumer (Lew Ayres) declares, \"We live in the trenches and we fight. We try not to be killed - that's all\". All Quiet is an anthology of now famous scenes: Ayres trapped in a shell crater with a man he has killed; the first meeting of the recruits and the veterans; infantrymen being mowed down to machine-gun visual rhythms; a moonlight swim with French farmgirls; Ayres' pacifist speech to his astonished schoolmates; and the final shot of the soldier's hand reaching for a fatal butterfly.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792841409", "B00AEFZDNA", "B000BYA4HE", "B00BTYJYR6", "B0009S4IKQ", "B00004TVUD", "B0006HBV3W", "B0000639EU", "B00005U8F4", "B00012FXJ0", "B00D9BNONW", "B00006RCO2", "B00011D1OK", "B0011FDVGI", "B00AATV07S", "B004HHX9XC", "B0000549B1", "B004SJVQ4I", "0780020707", "B00D3K357O", "B00004XPPC", "B00006RCO3", "B000BITV92", "0449213943", "B0002MHE1O", "B000HWZ4CA", "B0006GANN2", "B001GUYAZY", "B00011D1OU", "B00AEFY6DI", "B001DW2BIS", "B0046YK4KW", "B00006RCO1", "B000EHSVS2", "0792833287", "B000I6BJ56", "079284646X", "0767802470", "B000KX0IOA", "B001GLX6TY", "B0087ZG7OI", "B00AEBB9QY", "B000KJTGHO", "B00005J75F", "0764586718", "0780021312", "B00006ADD5", "B002VWNIAY", "B006TTC5HC", "B0009KNR42", "0792839730", "B00005PJ8S", "B00005JKF6", "6305918880", "B004VK74A4", "B0042FDCR2", "B005SQ3AO4", "B000LPR6GA", "B00049QQJQ", "B000XJD34I", "B00005AUKB", "B0000DJZ8R", "B00003CXBU", "B00008AOTN", "B00005PJ8T", "B0010AN7Z4", "B003ZEQMH8", "B0045HCJQM", "B0049985XW", "B0002V7ON8", "6304907729", "B00005AUKE", "B000M2E30O", "0143039040", "B000055Y0X", "B000LAZE8C", "B0050FXDDQ", "B001EOQCMG", "B0024FADBU", "B0001US8F8", "B0045HCJ8U", "B000FVQLRA", "B000BYA4II", "B001BEK8E2", "0792841662", "6305999872", "B0007OY2OY", "B00005N5S3", "B0040QYROA", "B001E18222", "B000O78L0U", "B00782O7IY", "B0000BWVCR", "B000MTEFWS", "B00B7U2GCC", "B00BY0EBK0", "B0010YSD7W", "B0045HCJJY", "B000O599NA", "B000EOTUSA"], "bought_together": ["0792841409", "B00BTYJYR6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000639EU", "B00D9BNONW", "0792841409", "0449213943"]}, "price": 15.94, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 210011}, "asin": "0783230435", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41XEDT59ZJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "All Quiet on the Western Front"}

{"description": "Stanley Kubrick dissects the nature of violence in this darkly ironic, near-future satire, adapted from Anthony Burgess's novel, complete with \"Nadsat\" slang. Classical music-loving proto-punk Alex (Malcolm McDowell) and his \"Droogs\" spend their nights getting high at the Korova Milkbar before embarking on \"a little of the old ultraviolence,\" such as terrorizing a writer, Mr. Alexander (Patrick Magee), and gang raping his wife (who later dies as a result). After Alex is jailed for bludgeoning the Cat Lady (Miriam Karlin) to death with one of her phallic sculptures, Alex submits to the Ludovico behavior modification technique to earn his freedom; he's conditioned to abhor violence through watching gory movies, and even his adored Beethoven is turned against him. Returned to the world defenseless, Alex becomes the victim of his prior victims, with Mr. Alexander using Beethoven's Ninth to inflict the greatest pain of all. When society sees what the state has done to Alex, however, the politically expedient move is made.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790734079", "0790705141", "B00004U8PA", "B00000FZCU", "6303953425", "6304484054", "0783235607", "6304039220", "630268644X", "B00006G8O1", "0790700506", "B0002G2B2W", "6305576173", "B000059HCI", "B00008X5J1", "0792837797", "B00000J2KZ", "6300267881", "6301977742", "6300216713", "6300269132", "B00000I1DI", "6302783356", "6300214826", "6305095566", "B00005JLET", "6302054982", "0800103106", "6302201845", "6302798450", "B00000J2L7", "6304994540", "6303686796", "B00005PJ8I", "6300216500", "0783228317", "6303107338", "6304935811", "B00004W5UA", "6302610702", "0783246641", "6300183211", "6302921058", "0792842111", "B00004T37H", "B00002E285", "B00003CXE6", "B000007OY0", "6301971582", "6300184064", "B00005LL26", "0790736039"], "bought_together": ["0790734079", "0790705141"], "also_viewed": ["0393312836", "0790705141", "B0013FSXT6", "B00GGAK0FS", "B008RO875Q", "B004O724M2", "B00004TLMC", "B00023NRSM", "B008M4MB8K", "6305440093", "6303953425", "6303939015", "6303148387", "6303861733", "B00003CXB4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 296220}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0790701022", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EV1DQCCGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Clockwork Orange"}
{"description": "Director William Friedkin was a hot ticket in Hollywood after the success ofThe French Connection, and he turned heads (in more ways than one) when he decided to makeThe Exorcistas his follow-up film. Adapted by William Peter Blatty from hiscontroversial bestseller, this shocking 1973 thriller set an intense and often-copied milestone for screen terror with its unflinching depiction of a young girl (Linda Blair) who is possessed by an evil spirit. Jason Miller and Max von Sydow are perfectly cast as the priests who risk their sanity and their lives to administer the rites of demonic exorcism, and Ellen Burstyn plays Blair's mother, who can only stand by in horror as her daughter's body is wracked by satanic disfiguration. One of the most frightening films ever made,The Exorcistwas mysteriously plagued by troubles during production, and the years have not diminished its capacity to disturb even the most stoical viewers. The film is presented in letterbox format on digital video disc, with a soundtrack that's guaranteed to curdle your blood.

{"description": "Stanley Kubrick'sThe Shiningis less an adaptation of Stephen King's bestselling horror novel than a complete reimagining of it from the inside out. In King's book, the Overlook Hotel is a haunted place that takes possession of its off-season caretaker and provokes him to murderous rage against his wife and young son. Kubrick's movie is an existential Road Runner cartoon (his steadicam scurrying through the hotel's labyrinthine hallways), in which the cavernously empty spaces inside the Overlook mirror the emptiness in the soul of the blocked writer, who's settled in for a long winter's hibernation. As many have pointed out, King's protagonist goes mad, but Kubrick's Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is Looney Tunes from the moment we meet him--all arching eyebrows and mischievous grin. (Both Nicholson and Shelley Duvall reach new levels of hysteria in their performances, driven to extremes by the director's fanatical demands for take after take after take.)The Shiningis terrifying--but not in the way fans of the novel might expect. When it was redone as a TV miniseries (reportedly because of King's dissatisfaction with the Kubrick film), the famous topiary-animal attack (which was deemed impossible to film in 1980) was there--but the deeper horror was lost. Kubrick'sThe Shininggets under your skin and chills your bones; it stays with you, inhabits you, haunts you. And there's no place to hide...--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300267881", "0790734079", "B00005ATQA", "6302038308", "6300182770", "B0009RRUKW", "0783235607", "0783228317", "B00000J2KZ", "B00004RNAC", "0790736039", "B00023NRSM", "6304508611", "6300182878", "6302921058", "6304509154", "0783216084", "6300214087", "B00004W5UA", "6301427076", "630268644X", "B000003KHS", "B000AMW2TK", "0790700506", "6300181340", "6300214753", "6302054982", "0784011923", "6305363668", "6303686796", "6305095566", "630021639X", "6302822688", "6305576173", "0783246641", "6304994540", "6303953425", "B00004U8PA", "0792158261", "0792100085", "6300213986", "6300189015", "630533577X", "6300214826", "0792846303", "6304288433", "6300147630", "0792842111", "B000007OY0", "0790741512", "6302158176", "0792846311", "6300183416", "0800103106", "B000005PFL", "6300183211", "0790733927", "6301666569", "6301871952", "0767825411", "630339406X", "6303109950", "6300216500", "6300214192", "6300262731", "6303257674", "6304214502", "630018627X", "6300214311", "1558807381", "0792839234", "0767819187", "B00005B238", "0790731975", "6303579388", "B000059HFB", "6302798450", "B00000FZCU", "6303651461", "6303566391", "6302642175", "6301971582", "6300218058", "6301094352", "6300184064", "6300181278", "6304457383", "6300214672", "6300262855", "0800125762", "6303257305"], "bought_together": ["0790734079"], "also_viewed": ["6300147630", "6300182878", "B00005ATQA", "6300189015", "6300267881", "B00023NRSM", "6300213005", "6303953425", "0307743659", "6303148352", "0790734079", "B001AQT0Z4", "6300183211", "0784011923", "B00BBND56G", "0788806270"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 268792}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.0, "brand": "", "asin": "0790705141", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5106FV0S4PL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Shining [VHS]"}
{"description": "The most viscerally frightening and disturbing homicidal-maniac picture sinceThe Silence of the Lambs,Sevenis based on an idea that's both gruesome and ingenious. A serial killer forces each of his victims to die by acting out one of the seven deadly sins. The murder scene is then artfully arranged into a grotesque tableau, a graphic illustration of each mortal vice. From the jittery opening credits to the horrifying (and seemingly inescapable) concluding twist, director David Fincher immerses us in a murky urban twilight where everything seems to be rotting, rusting, or molding; the air is cold and heavy with dread. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are the detectives who skillfully track down the killer--all the while unaware that he has been closing in on them, as well. Gwyneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey are also featured, but it is director Fincher and the ominous, overwhelmingly oppressive atmosphere of doom that he creates that are the real stars of the film. It's a terrific date movie--for vampires.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005V9HH", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000M341QE", "0783240295", "B00003CXZ4", "6305313687", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000P0J0EW", "B000LP6KNU", "B000P0J09M", "B000P0J0AG", "B000069HZP", "B004SIP95G", "B0009A40ES", "B0007PALZ2", "B002NZK5RI", "B002AF4Y9G", "B00AEBB89W", "B004SIP7VM", "B00AEFXQ9S", "B00004BZIY", "B003ASLJO0", "B00003CXWV", "B00096S49Y", "B00AEFYF2K", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00008975Z", "B002T9H2LA", "B00005JLKN", "B000LC55F2", "0767802519", "B004FQX5B6", "B002VWNIEA", "B004SIP7TE", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00AEFXEGS", "0792846435", "B00003CXSP", "B002VWNICC", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000C20VPA", "B00AEFXESQ", "B000P0J0EM", "B000093FLA", "B002ZG99N6", "B002NZK5VO", "B003LR5BD0", "B002VWNIDG", "B000I2J736", "B0001FR3IQ", "B00AEFYYH6", "B000F5GNX8", "B002ZG980U", "B00005JN0W", "B00005JMJG", "B0000AC8LR", "B003ASLJQI", "B000E5N684", "B002XMGGK6", "B003HKN52U", "B00AP2DC94", "B00001ZWUS", "B000A2UBN4", "B000244GCW", "B000A7DVR2", "B002GHHHN8", "B00004WG2F", "B00AEFXKUI", "B001R3YRG2", "B002NZK5UU", "B00004XPPG", "B0034G4P7G", "B000FKO5QK", "B0009MDPYM", "B000NVT0SO", "B003ASLJQS", "B00005JPD0", "B00005JKWX", "B000YAF4MA", "B00005JKIS", "6305065551", "0783229526", "0783233477", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00005JA8B", "B00AEFXYJA", "B0000YEEGM", "B007D5E7C2", "B0002V7ON8", "B000N6U0E2", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00AEBB8LA", "6305718954", "B002AT8K9W", "B00AMSLDTM", "B000FS9FCG"], "bought_together": ["B0007DFJ0G", "6305313687"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004LWZW4M", "B00005V9HH", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000P0J0EW"]}, "price": 13.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 172718}, "asin": "0790729989", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VQ890AJML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Seven (Widescreen)"}

{"description": "Winner of four Academy Awards, including best picture, director, supporting actor, and best editing, Clint Eastwood's 1992 masterpiece stands as one of the greatest and most thematically compelling Westerns ever made. &quot;The movie summarized everything I feel about the Western,&quot; said Eastwood at the time of the film's release. &quot;The moral is the concern with gunplay.&quot; To illustrate that theme, Eastwood stars as a retired, once-ruthless killer-turned-gentle-widower and hog farmer. He accepts one last bounty-hunter mission--to find the men who brutalized a prostitute--to help support his two motherless children. Joined by his former partner (Morgan Freeman) and a cocky greenhorn (Jaimz Woolvett), he takes on a corrupt sheriff (Oscar winner Gene Hackman) in a showdown that makes the viewer feel the full impact of violence and its corruption of the soul. Dedicated to Eastwood's mentors Sergio Leone and Don Siegel and featuring a colorful role for Richard Harris, it's arguably Eastwood's crowning directorial achievement.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003ASLJS6", "B003ASLJRC", "6304698801", "B000N3SSBW", "B0000TANUI", "6304711905", "0783225725", "B000E5N6LG", "B00388PK7O", "0767817710", "B001LMAK88", "B00000K0DM", "B003ASLJO0", "B000XR9L50", "0792839056", "B002M9WW3A", "B003ASLJOU", "B0015XHQT4", "B003ASLJNQ", "B000055Y0Y", "B003AWRMBU", "B003ASLJIQ", "B000O599ZS", "6304698798", "B000GFRI4K", "B00AEBBA0E", "B003UESJME", "B0018PH3L0", "B00AEBB932", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00008IHAW", "B0045HCJTO", "B00HETDQKG", "0783228007", "B004FPXMDI", "B007Y1NR1W", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEFXVOI", "B000059TFW", "B003ASLJQI", "B00AEFYSEA", "B003ASLJKE", "B004AOECXI", "B003AWRMBA", "B00005LOL0", "B001LRJH0U", "B00001ZWUS", "B000W1SZBS", "B001M9ELQ2", "B000056H2J", "B003AWRM9M", "B00AEFYL6K", "B003AWRMC4", "B0006GANN2", "B000O599WQ", "B000NQRR34", "B0045HCJSK", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00AEBB8YM", "B00008CMT4", "B003ASLJQS", "B0008ENHUS", "B00008CMR4", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000O599Y4", "0792842502", "6304696612", "B003NF97MQ", "B0010DR4BO", "B0007MAO0C", "B0006GAOJA", "0792838408", "B003AWRM9W", "B00009W5CA", "B00066FBQG", "B000O599YE", "0767830555", "078322592X", "B000BDH6DU", "B000BITVBA", "B003ASLJJU", "B001KRVLCI", "B0000A2ZU1", "B000P0J09M", "B00008PX7J", "B00005LC4R", "B00B0U2SFE", "B002VWNIBI", "B0010YVCI4", "B004SIP7ZS", "B002O3Z4XE", "B00132D7Y0", "079284646X", "B003XURDAY", "B003ASLJK4", "B0001FVDJQ", "B00004XPPC", "B00AEBB9CS", "B0007MANYY", "6304698747"], "bought_together": ["B003ASLJS6", "B003ASLJRC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003ASLJRC", "B003ASLJS6", "0792842502", "B004AOECXI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 104810}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "WARNER STUDIOS", "asin": "0790729644", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DRkkBZz0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Unforgiven (Snap Case)"}
{"description": "Inspired by the 1960s TV series that starred James Garner in the title role, this lightweight Western from 1994 proved to be a surprising box-office hit. Well, maybe not such a big surprise, since it's from the star and director of theLethal Weaponmovies, and operates with a similar combination of mainstream plotting and easygoing humor. Mel Gibson stars as card-playing gunslinger Brett Maverick, who meets up with wily gambler Annabelle Bransford (Jodie Foster) and a marshal named Zane Cooper (James Garner, trading his old role to Gibson) on his way to the World Series of poker in St. Louis. Maverick's trying to raise the $5,000 needed to join the high-stakes contest, but that's easier said than done due to a lot of unscrupulous competition and a twisting plot of tricks and deceptions. It's all played for laughs and action, so the movie never wears out its welcome, despite a running time that could've used a good trimming. It's also fun to see the rapport between Gibson and Garner, as if the present and former Mavericks were a kind of surrogate son and father, bonded by their mutual skill in charming and conning their way through tight spots. Director Richard Donner also pays tribute to old Westerns by casting veterans of the genre in cameo roles (including Bert Remsen, Dub Taylor, and Denver Pyle), and Gibson'sLethal Weaponcostar Danny Glover pops in for a surprise appearance. None of this really adds up to much since the movie makes no pretense about taking itself seriously, but that's precisely why audiences found it so entertaining.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0013D8M4E", "B001DDBD4K", "B000FO0AA6", "B00AEBB9WI", "B002GHHHNI", "B002GOAH1A", "B000056H2E", "0790731460", "B000FO0A9W", "B003AWRMBA", "0783227396", "B00DDT0JB0", "B000056H2F", "B007AAF3FK", "6305213283", "B00B00HUC0", "6305236569", "B00007GZR1", "B00158K0QU", "B0003JAOCC", "B000ARXF96", "B00008DDXA", "B002VWNID6", "B00368PSKK", "B00006SFKE", "B000CEV3M8", "6305428077", "B001ECDVJU", "B004CTG6TO", "B000ENC5YW", "B00003CXJ1", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00000IQW5", "B000JJSJPK", "6305127646", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000E5N6LG", "B00005ATZT", "B000BGR1B4", "B000Y11BC6", "0767827813", "B00ALTQRRK", "B001LMAK88", "B000FTCLQC", "B00008G7QH", "B00AEFY4CG", "B002LFQIL2", "B000JYW5BE", "B00AEBB8NS", "0792838408", "B002NZK5UU", "B000683VI4", "B002KE4ZJG", "B00507O3II", "078322740X", "B0001V1M6E", "B002O3Z4XE", "6304765266", "B004ZRFQCG", "B00936A1ZG", "B000XJD3K2", "B000N4RASS", "B000EGDB10", "B00005LOL0", "B00AEFXYOA", "B00AEFYTEY", "B000BF0C8E", "B000N2HD6O", "B000A0GXGA", "B001JFKWE4", "B002XDR5NM", "B004AOECXI", "B008JFURII"], "bought_together": ["B00DDT0JB0", "0790731460"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DDT0JB0", "0790731460", "B007AAF3FK", "B000BGR1B4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 71477}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.69, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "0790731940", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516B6P3CKFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Maverick (Snap Case Packaging)"}
{"description": "A surprise sleeper hit when released in 1992, this romantic fantasy works as a comedic adventure and a gentle tearjerker thanks to Mel Gibson's appealing performance. He plays Daniel, a daring test pilot who is deeply distraught by the apparent death of his girlfriend, Helen, in 1939. Feeling little reason to live, he volunteers for a pioneering cryogenics experiment and is thawed out 50 years later by two young boys. They bring the confused pilot home to Nat's single mom, Claire (Jamie Lee Curtis). There's a hint of romance, but Daniel desperately needs to know if Helen really died in 1939, and he discovers that love has a way of surviving a half-century leap in time. The premise is hokey and certain plot details are conveniently ignored, but Gibson, Curtis, and Elijah Wood (as Nat) hold it together with irresistible charm and just the right balance of fantasy and drama.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000IQW5", "B00004W46I", "B00019073K", "630471193X", "B002GHHHP6", "6305213283", "B002GOAGZC", "0783227396", "0783230079", "B001CW8016", "630542845X", "B000FO0A9W", "B000FO0AA6", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00AEBB9WI", "B002NZK5TQ", "B005FQ2H8W", "6305428514", "B001C47ZOW", "0783226810", "6305133468", "B001BGS17Q", "B00005RRK1", "B0045HCJRQ", "B00AEFY4CG", "B004SIP8JI", "6304765266", "0783226896", "B000NA1WDQ", "B000JYW5B4", "B001ECDVK4", "0767810856", "B002GHHHKQ", "B00D2UMHGA", "B0045HCJ9E", "B003ASLJPE", "B000CEV3M8", "6305428506", "B00AEBB8NS", "0783225733", "6305236569", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B001ECDVJU", "B002GIBVV6", "B0068FZ0GK", "B0000A2ZO0", "B0002TSZI8", "B0039QPVRY", "B000FOPPC4", "630587493X", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00003CWU3", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000065V3L", "B005F2JRUC", "B00007GZR5", "B004SIP9RO", "B00008G8M4", "B004SIP8LG", "B00004YA66", "B000YDBPAM", "B004AOECXI", "B000P0J0CY", "B00407PNY2", "B003AWRMBA", "B0000AOV4I", "B000ENC5YW", "0783230591", "B000Y11B7Q", "B00081912E", "B00008G7UF", "B00008DDXA", "B007JNR4WI", "B002GHHHPQ", "B001BGS16W", "0790731932", "B00158K0QU", "B002GHHHHO", "B00005T7I1", "B0000542C9"], "bought_together": ["B00004W46I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004W46I", "B00000IQW5", "B002GHHHP6", "630471193X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 98219}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.12, "brand": "Forever", "asin": "0790731916", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z75D1Y4XL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Forever Young (Snap Case)"}
{"description": "This romantic, witty, and ultimately poignant glimpse at two strangers (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy) who share thoughts, affections, and past experiences during one 14-hour tryst in Vienna somehow remains writer/director Richard Linklater's  (Dazed and Confused,Slacker) most overlooked gem. Delpy, a stunning, low-key Parisian, meets the stammering American Hawke, as the two share a Eurorail seat--she's starting school in Paris, he's finishing a vacation. Their mutual attraction leads to an awkward meeting (beautifully played by each performer), and Hawke suggests that Delpy spend his remaining 14 hours in Vienna with him.Typically, this skeleton is as much plot as Linklater provides; as usual, he's more interested in concentrating his talents on observing the casual, playful conversations between his leads. His tight time frame allows the characters to say anything to one another, and topics ranging from politics to past romances to fears of the future flow with subtle finesse. The short time frame is also cruel, however, because beneath this love affair lies the painful reality that the two most likely will never see each other again and will be left only with memories--an idea Linklater drives home with an effective snapshot conclusion.Hardly the trite Gen-X bitch session that many '90s films using this approach become, the film feels more like a Bresson or Rohmer piece, containing sharp perceptions--and flawed humans rather than stereotypes.

{"description": "Although it was unfortunately ignored during its brief theatrical release, this sumptuously seductive production is that rarest of cinematic breeds, the (barely) respectable guilty pleasure. Combining historical fact with hysterical anachronisms of language and mannerism, it's been tailored for maximum contemporary appeal but maintains a lush, romantic feel for its factual 16th-century tale of Venetian love, lust, and political repression. Catherine McCormack (Mel Gibson's ill-fated bride inBraveheart) delivers a star-making performance as the \"dangerous beauty\" who becomes a skillful courtesan to pursue her forbidden love for a dashing Venetian senator (Rufus Sewell). It's all rather silly in a high-toned fashion, and the film turns dour when the church intervenes with aScarlet Letter-like papal inquest. But the movie's joyously ribald vitality is utterly irresistible, and the casting of McCormack with Jaqueline Bisset (as her mother and courtesan mentor) is a stroke of pure genius. Merchant-Ivory would've made a smarter film from this material, but it probably wouldn't be nearly as entertaining.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["630437240X", "6303396623", "6301670140"]}, "price": 21.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 267533}, "asin": "0790736365", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZCPY3GV2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dangerous Beauty [VHS]"}

{"description": "The third installment in the cinematic incarnation of Tom Clancy's CIA analyst Jack Ryan and the second starring Harrison Ford, this follow-up toPatriot Gamesis a more complex, rewarding, and bolder film than its predecessor. Ford returns as Ryan, this time embroiled in a failed White House bid to wipe out a Colombian drug cartel and cover up the mess. The script, by Clancy and John Milius (Red Dawn), has an air of true adventure about it as Ryan places himself in harm's way to extract covert soldiers abandoned in a Latin American jungle. There are a couple of remarkable set pieces expertly handled byPatriot Gamesdirector Phillip Noyce, especially a shocking scene involving an ambush on Ryan's car in an alley. The supporting cast is superb, including Willem Dafoe as the soldiers' leader, Henry Czerny as Ryan's enemy at the CIA, Joaquim de Almeida as a smooth-talking villain, Ann Magnuson as an unwitting confederate in international crime, and James Earl Jones as Ryan's dying boss. The DVD release has a widescreen presentation, theatrical trailer, closed captioning, optional French soundtrack, and optional Spanish subtitles.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["079212569X", "0792116887", "6304259131", "0800199421", "B00006IUNT", "6304618344", "0800125762", "0790748169", "6300214567", "6303020089", "B00003CXTF", "0783222955", "6304258984", "6300216500", "6303269834", "B00004RVRP", "6305718792", "6300215717", "0792147618", "6303313345", "0800132009", "B00004WIDB", "6305622825", "0783223218", "0792837797", "6302597625", "6303696813", "6303212263", "6305171750", "6302091632", "0790738066", "0800116917", "630150528X", "0790701251", "6304458975", "6300184269", "0790731274", "B00000IO4G", "6300218066", "B0002GTWOM", "B000005PFL", "079073799X", "079213690X", "B000068TSI", "0790731975", "6301208773", "6304457391", "6301888901", "B00000K2SC", "6302909023", "630420065X", "0790744589", "B00005NSYB", "6304214502", "B00004XPQ6", "6301586026", "6300214540", "6302945089", "6304925131", "6304681496", "B00006BS6T", "6300213730", "6304071876", "6301016289", "6303101267", "B00003JRAB", "6302712009", "6303560040", "6302936381", "6305123616", "6301276930", "6304353634", "B00006RCSC", "0800179552", "B00007CVYA", "6301071379", "6303562248", "B00003CXE6", "6303383300", "6300183211", "B000006FNX", "0790733927", "0792839846", "B00003G1FZ", "0792153189", "6303168507"], "bought_together": ["079212569X", "0792116887"], "also_viewed": ["079212569X", "0792116887", "0792134877"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 44869}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.73, "brand": "", "asin": "0792133153", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41F397NCBNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Clear And Present Danger [VHS]"}

{"description": "Tautly directed and superbly photographed, this crowd-pleasing thriller from 1997 is indebted to Steven Spielberg'sDuel, but more closely resemblesDead Calmin its strengths and weaknesses. Kurt Russell plays a stressed-out husband whose wife (Kathleen Quinlan) disappears after their car breaks down in the desert. Tracking her whereabouts leads to an interstate theft and kidnapping ring, and as Russell pursues--and is pursued by--a vicious redneck played to perfection by J.T. Walsh (in one of his final film roles), the movie succumbs to several tense, but utterly conventional action sequences. That doesn't stop the movie from being an above-average nail-biter. It is so effectively directed by co-writer Jonathan Mostow that even the more surreal situations seem plausible and altogether unsettling. Russell's performance is key to the film's success--he's smart enough to be admirable, and we can readily identify with his frustration, confusion, and torment.

{"description": "A stupendous historical saga,Braveheartwon five Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director for star Mel Gibson. He plays William Wallace, a 13th-century Scottish commoner who unites the various clans against a cruel English King, Edward the Longshanks (Patrick McGoohan). The scenes of hand-to-hand combat are brutally violent, but they never glorify the bloodshed. There is such enormous scope to this story that it works on a smaller, more personal scale as well, essaying love and loss, patriotism and passion. Extremely moving, it reveals Gibson as a multitalented performer and remarkable director with an eye for detail and an understanding of human emotion. (His first directorial effort was 1993'sMan Without a Face.) The film is nearly three hours long and includes several plot tangents, yet is never dull.

{"description": "When the theatrical release of James Cameron'sTitanicwas delayed from July to December of 1997, media pundits speculated that Cameron's $200&nbsp;million disaster epic would cause the director's downfall, signal the end of the blockbuster era, and sink Paramount Studios as quickly as the ill-fated luxury liner had sunk on that fateful night of April&nbsp;14, 1912. Some studio executives were confident, others horrified, but the clarity of hindsight turned Cameron into an Oscar-winning genius, a shrewd businessman, and one of the most successful directors in the history of motion pictures.Titanicwould surpass the $1&nbsp;billion mark in global box-office receipts (largely due to multiple viewings, the majority by teenage girls), win 11&nbsp;Academy Awards including best picture and director, produce the best-selling movie soundtrack of all time, and make a global superstar of Leonardo DiCaprio. A bona fide pop-cultural phenomenon, the film has all the ingredients of a blockbuster (romance, passion, luxury, grand scale, a snidely villain, and an epic, life-threatening crisis), but Cameron's alchemy of these ingredients proved more popular than anyone could have predicted. His stroke of genius was to combine absolute authenticity with a pair of fictional lovers whose tragic fate would draw viewers into the heart-wrenching reality of theTitanicdisaster. As starving artist Jack Dawson and soon-to-be-married socialite Rose DeWitt Bukater, DiCaprio and Kate Winslet won the hearts of viewers around the world, and their brief but never-forgotten love affair provides the humanity that Cameron needed to turnTitanicinto an emotional experience. Present-day framing scenes (featuring Gloria Stuart as the 101-year-old Rose) add additional resonance to the story, and although some viewers proved vehemently immune to Cameron's manipulations, few can deny the production's impressive achievements. Although some of the computer-generated visual effects look artificial, others--such as the sunset silhouette ofTitanicduring its first evening at sea, or the climactic splitting of the ship's sinking hull--are state-of-the-art marvels. In terms of sets and costumes alone, the film is never less than astounding. More than anything else, however, the film's overwhelming popularity speaks for itself.Titanicis an event film and a monument to Cameron's risk-taking audacity, blending the tragic irony of theTitanicdisaster with just enough narrative invention to give the historical event its fullest and most timeless dramatic impact.Titanicis an epic love story on par withGone with the Wind, and like that earlier box-office phenomenon, it's a film for the ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305123616", "6304117752", "6301792734", "6303215734", "B00000JS61", "6304178352", "6303396623", "6303314015", "B00003CXTF", "0769403468", "6301734734", "6302936381", "6303300480", "6305368139", "B00005RRG3", "6302610702", "0792839846", "6300207919", "B000P0J0C4", "6304546262", "B000056BRF", "6304400551", "6303101267", "630150528X", "6303637574", "B000P0J0EW", "6305126062", "6302935148", "0800199421", "6304681496", "0792116887", "6301963911", "B0000DCGT1", "B00001IVED", "6305169187", "B00006RCST", "6300216721", "630197879X", "0800113055", "076780922X", "080010367X", "0800141326", "0800184319", "6304039522", "B000066AXC"], "bought_together": ["6305123616"], "also_viewed": ["B009VQHDSQ", "6303314015", "B0074JODXU", "B00003CXTF", "B003JQZXWW", "6302787068", "6301796535", "0788812807", "0788806270", "B00005JKDQ", "6304500831", "6305229449", "6304117752", "6300213668", "6304089767", "B0000AQZYM", "079213690X", "6303049079", "6305123616", "6303402348", "6301792734", "0788812408", "B00079HZSE", "B000035Z2S", "B00000K3AN", "0788805843", "6302526574", "B0000029YC", "6303534422", "6303215734", "B0070285YE", "B00008LDO9", "0783216084", "6304434340", "B00BBND56G", "0788805533", "6300183211", "6302320402", "6305750750", "B0002CHI3S", "0790748266", "6304143184", "B0000040CM", "B005X7H9SQ", "B00004RFHF", "B00005V1Z7", "6302814782", "6301572688", "B00000JS61", "B008SLUWZG", "6303257844", "B00078XGO2", "0790736039", "B0000040EJ", "B000065U6Q", "B00003CX7L", "B00000ADKZ", "6300263673", "6302178924"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 65950}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.47, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "0792151712", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21BAWEVBJ1L.jpg", "title": "Titanic [VHS]"}
{"description": "At her job, driving instructor Abbie (Madonna) has no problems getting her students to bend over backwards and tie themselves into knots for her. But in life she can't seem to find anyone to tie the knot with her. Robert (Everett), her best friend and confidant, runs a successful landscaping business but is having equally dismal luck finding his Mr. Right. When Abbie's latest relationship crumbles, she turns to Robert (who happens to be gay) for comfort and advice. They commiserate over a parade of margaritas and martinis, which results in an unexpected tryst. Abbie becomes pregnant and believing, that this may be her one shot at motherhood, decides to have the child. Robert, committed to being a good father, moves in with her, and together they create an unconventional but loving home for their precocious son, Sam (Stumpf). Robert continues to date but keeps parenting as his first priority. Abbie, on the other hand, uses her yoga skills to remain celibate but finally relents when she meets Ben (Bratt), a handsome and charming investment banker. Romance flowers between Abbie and Ben, and as they grow closer Robert feels his role as father threatened. Tensions mount, and when Abbie and Ben announce plans to be wed, the family explodes over a heart-wrenching custody battle for Sam.

{"description": "Welcome to Delos, the high-tech Disneyland for adults that Michael Crichton created forWestworld, a nifty science fiction thriller from 1973 that also marked the popular novelist's feature-film directorial debut. The movie is so named because the vacationing buddies who travel to Delos (James Brolin, Richard Benjamin) choose Westworld as their destination (the other choices being Roman World and Medieval World), where they are free to indulge their movie-inspired fantasies of the Wild West.  From brothel beauties to black-hatted gunslingers (like the villain played by Yul Brynner), the place is populated by perfectly humanlike robots programmed and monitored to cater to every guest's fancy. But fun turns into abject horror when the robots--particularly Brynner's badman--begin to malfunction and Delos turns into an amusement park that's anything but amusing.Westworldhas moments of camp and the look of a low-budget backlot production, but two decades before Crichton revamped his idea to createJurassic Park, this movie made the most of its interesting and exciting premise.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300181987", "6303471552", "6300213676", "6301977742", "6300213838", "6301971582", "6300147630", "0790731975", "6302890721", "6300271781", "0784011923", "6301977815", "630442972X", "6301327845", "0790733897", "6300181537", "B000007PI4", "6301968948", "6301971426", "0792846311", "6300183084", "6300181472", "6300181464", "6302814723", "0792845684", "0790733927", "6302182522"], "bought_together": ["6303471552"], "also_viewed": ["6302969352", "6303471552"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 375477}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.98, "brand": "", "asin": "0792835077", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B90XC72EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Westworld [VHS]"}
{"description": "When it was released during Hollywood's golden year of 1939,The Wizard of Ozdidn't start out as the perennial classic it has since become. The film did respectable business, but it wasn't until its debut on television that this family favorite saw its popularity soar. And whileOz's TV broadcasts are now controlled by media mogul Ted Turner (who owns the rights), the advent of home video has made this lively musical a mainstay in the staple diet of great American films. Young Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland), her dog, Toto, and her three companions on the Yellow Brick Road to Oz--the Tin Man (Jack Haley), the Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr), and the Scarecrow (Ray Bolger)--have become pop-culture icons and central figures in the legacy of fantasy for children. As the Wicked Witch who covets Dorothy's enchanted ruby slippers, Margaret Hamilton has had the singular honor of scaring the wits out of children for more than six decades. The film's still as fresh, frightening, and funny as it was when first released. It may take some liberal detours from the original story by L. Frank Baum, but it's loyal to the Baum legacy while charting its own course as a spectacular film. Shot in glorious Technicolor, befitting its dynamic production design (Munchkinland alone is a psychedelic explosion of color and d&eacute;cor),The Wizard of Ozmay not appeal to every taste as the years go by, but it's required viewing for kids of all ages.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B005F96UJ6", "B0000VCZKM", "B00E9ZATKI", "0792839749", "B0087F7VSY", "B0090XLDKY", "B002M2Z3BA", "076781326X", "B00C7JGDBW", "B000P0J09W", "B000URDCC6", "B002HK9IDQ", "B0000DZ3EN", "B000RPCK2E", "B000065V42", "B001JV5BF8", "B0000AM6IY", "B00335EQ0E", "B005NFJAZS", "B003VS0CX8", "B0000VCZKW", "0062278010", "B002NZK5SW", "B0010X744G", "B00CQRN3QI", "B0009XT8ME", "B000HT3PGU", "B006VJ1AAI", "B00005RRG7", "B008H6GHEM", "B00GVFJ5QS", "B00HVBB140", "B002VWNIAY", "B000BT970O", "B002CLBJPK", "0060293233", "B00028HBES", "B00322XV8Q", "B00EV1YZ96", "B000AJJNIG", "B00AATV0WS", "B0054OGQM8", "1495421864", "0739060821", "B00AEFXMGU", "0792833759", "B00AMSQBNK", "B000TPTCP0", "B0009X75QU", "B00ITVMMOY", "B00005RRGB", "B0017Q0SJ4", "0767836324", "B004302N2Q", "084318017X", "B001GLX6UI", "B003YBW2Y4", "1402766254", "B00019GHU2", "B00003CXCQ", "B00AMSM9CW", "B00005JG6M", "B0047QLNUY", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B00447L4JG", "0767819659", "B00000JPH6", "B002BIGCXS", "B00G5G7EXY", "B0000AK7AB", "B006FE83UE", "B002VWNIBI", "B00005JL1P", "B001ILFUDC", "0800177258", "B000QQLVPQ", "B00005RDSQ", "B00JHH1ZN8", "B0006IINYQ", "B0015NORDW", "B002GHHHNS", "B0013ND30M", "0792838408", "B001AGXEAG", "B0047CG9F2", "B00006ADD5", "B0013FSL3E", "B00079Z9VO", "B00F6SHECS", "B0008JIJ2E", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00005JN4W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HVBB140", "B005F96UJ6", "B0000VCZKM", "B00I6JOD2S"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 206236}, "asin": "0792833171", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GYW80GAJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Wizard of Oz"}

There's also a seductive villainous with the suggestive name of Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen), and the great actress Judi Dench makes her first appearance as Bond's superior, M, who wisecracks about 007's &quot;dinosaur&quot; status as a globetrotting sexist.

{"description": "Australian director Peter Weir had made several excellent films beforeThe Year of Living Dangerouslywas released to critical acclaim in 1983, but it was this moody tale of romance and political upheaval that bought Weir and star Mel Gibson their tickets to Hollywood. (Weir's next film was the 1985 Harrison Ford hitWitness.) Set in Indonesia in 1965, the film focuses on a group of Caucasian journalists and photographers who are in Jakarta to cover the political upheavals that are threatening to collapse the unstable government of President Sukarno. Gibson plays an Australian correspondent named Guy Hamilton who's determined to get the best story, and he's given invaluable assistance from Billy Kwan (Linda Hunt), a half-Indonesian, half-Australian photojournalist who knows the culture inside and out. Billy introduces Guy to Jill (Sigourney Weaver) and their romance develops in an atmosphere of political unrest and constant personal danger. This journalistic adventure is compelling in itself (and Hunt's gender-switching performance won her a much-deserved Oscar), but it's Weir's creation of a rich, authentically exotic locale that gives the movie its alluring and subtly mysterious atmosphere. A tale of tragedy and survival, it's also a story about fascinating people at a turbulent juncture of history, and the empathy they feel for each other and the culture that surrounds them.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0140065350", "B00BTYJYR6", "B00004Y87L", "B00005QAPI", "B001C47ZOW", "B00000153L", "B001DJLD08", "B000056KMW", "0780021134", "B000001FJZ", "B000MRA542", "B000TXNDV6", "B00KE3B9US", "B00K6D1SAC", "B00DL48BM6", "B00CPTUOI2", "B0000C0FM4", "B00005RRK1", "B00019073K", "B00FGVS07S", "B00441GYOM", "B004NTXH7C", "B0000TG8XY", "B000GG4Y32", "B00I3C1T34", "B0008GGN9I", "B0045HCIZE", "B000CEXEWA", "0783233523", "0783230591", "B00004RF83", "B00824FK9W", "B00J5LXT44", "B002HR456E", "B0000DGKI8", "B00005UJYA", "B005IX3C72", "B0001DCYUU", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B0007ZEOPK", "B001VC99HQ", "0783226853", "B00JVFRLIE", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B00049QJ9I", "B00007ELD1", "B003LMPKSQ", "B00IYJFB2G", "B00BGARGR8", "0792845773", "B003O7I6SE", "B00004TIT4", "B001AXL67W", "B001EKP5D2", "B007Y1NR1W", "B000FFJYAW", "B000ECX0J2", "B004WPYO7E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BTYJYR6", "B00IWULQQ2", "B00004Y87L"]}, "price": 15.29, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 208013}, "asin": "0792836006", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H3DPF3ZSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Year of Living Dangerously"}

Thus, the James brothers are played by James and Stacy Keach; the Youngers by David, Keith, and Robert Carradine; the Millers by Randy and Dennis Quaid; and the Fords by Christopher and Nicholas Guest. Hill, working with an evocative Ry Cooder score, creates a film that is at once breathtakingly exciting and elegiac in its treatment of these post-Civil War outlaws. The Keaches in particular bring a surprising dignity to the roles of Frank and Jesse James, while David Carradine is a hoot as Cole Younger--and the Quaids mimic real life (as it was for them then) in their battles as the Miller brothers.

{"description": "FutureNightmarecreator andScreamweaver Wes Craven's  film debut is a primitive little production that rises above its cut-rate  production values and hazy, grainy patina via its grimly affecting portrait  of human evil infiltrating a middle-class household. The story is adapted  from Ingmar Bergman'sThe Virgin Spring, but the film has more in  common with Sam Peckinpah'sStraw Dogsas it charts the descent of a  harmless married couple into methodical killers. A quartet of criminals--a  distorted version of the nuclear family--kidnaps a pair of teenage girls and  proceeds to ravage, rape, torture, and finally brutally murder them in the  woods, unwittingly within walking distance of their rural home. The killers  take refuge in the girls' own home, but when the parents discover just who  they are and what they've done, they plot violent retribution.Along with George Romero'sNight of the Living Deadand Tobe Hooper'sTexas Chainsaw Massacre, Craven helped redefine American horror with  this debut--all three movies portray modern society crumbling into madness  and horror. But, unlike his fellow directors, Craven gives his film an  uncomfortable verisimilitude, setting it squarely in the heartland of modern  America. While at times it's awkward and inconsistent, with distracting comic  interludes, his handling of the brutal horror scenes is unsettling, and the  death of the daughter is an unexpectedly quiet and lyrical moment.--Sean  Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792839242", "6302921058", "B00000K0DU", "6300214311", "6300182770", "B00000IQUT"], "also_viewed": ["6302921058"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 475308}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.78, "brand": "", "asin": "079284632X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512ZWA7XGZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Last House on the Left [VHS]"}

{"description": "Writer David Mamet created two engrossing and memorable characters, played by Alec Baldwin as the urbane fashion photographer and Anthony Hopkins as a reserved and intellectual billionaire. They find themselves teamed up against a giant Kodiak bear, and their own inner demons, when lost together in the Alaskan wilderness. There is a lot going on in this picture, as the subject matter includes male rivalry, the isolationism of extreme wealth, and, most conspicuously, the survival of the fittest. Mamet's script, which sounds a little too arch in spots, is well served by New Zealand director Lee Tamahori, who knows how to capture beauty and brutality in one frame. Although the themes are enormous in scope, they are well balanced. One rarely overpowers the other, nor does the achingly beautiful scenery overshadow the acting. Even if you do not like the intellectualism of the dialogue, there are some great scenes with the bear.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["0783216084", "6300182304", "6300182452", "0783222955", "B00003BE3X", "B00003CXFU", "0783223218", "6302945089", "6301888901", "6301208773", "6303020089", "6302787564", "6304258984", "0800132009"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 312341}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.94, "brand": "", "asin": "0793927501", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518EXVXQ1VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Edge [VHS]"}

{"description": "This horrible misfire from the usually reliable writer-director Andrew Bergman (The Freshman) has nothing funny, provocative, timely, or interesting to say (despite being based on a novel by Carl Hiaasen) once Demi Moore gets her clothes off. Moore plays a single, unemployed mom caught up in a custody battle who elects to make some money by stripping at a club. The character's troubles don't end there, however: Her ex-husband is posing a threat, and a perverted congressman (Burt Reynolds) is looking for more than a lap dance. Bergman's great wit is nowhere in sight, and the film primarily becomes another opportunity for Moore to function like a special effect.

{"description": "Francis Ford Coppola returns to Stoker's novel for this umpteenth take of the Transylvanian bloodsucker. Gary Oldman plays the vampire, Dracula, doomed to be a creature of the night after forsaking God but aroused by the image of a British woman (Winona Ryder) who resembles his own lost love. Oldman does well by the monster, even if he doesn't register much personality in the process, and Anthony Hopkins is a little overachieving as the vampire killer Van Helsing. The rest of the cast is serviceable, except Keanu Reeves, who--not atypically--is wooden and somehow empty. Coppola seems to approach the film as chunks of experimental opportunity, some of which work out all right while others are mannered or even foolish. What is undeniable is the tremendous buzz of the film's energy, particularly in a fantastic middle sequence that plays like a psychedelic nightmare.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000059XXZ", "0767819187"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 628165}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.95, "brand": "", "asin": "0800137884", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512X6W16VZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bram Stoker's Dracula (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "Like many other films by Canadian director David Cronenberg (especiallyCrash),Dead Ringerspresents the cinematic and psychological equivalent of an automobile accident--you dare not look, but you can't turn away. The film marked a directorial breakthrough for Cronenberg, who was able to continue some of the themes explored in his earlier horror films while graduating to a higher, more critically \"respectable\" level of artistic sophistication. The film is loosely based, amazingly enough, on a true story about twin gynecologists who routinely traded each others' identities, lives and even lovers. Utilizing innovative split-screen technology (years before computer manipulation made such trickery much easier), the film stars Jeremy Irons in flawless dual roles as the identical brothers Beverly and Elliot Mantle. Their ability to instantly switch identities leads them to a shared relationship with a well-known actress (Genevieve Bujold) and, ultimately, a physical and psychological tailspin that sends them both to the brink of madness and death. The scenario suggests that both men are halves of a whole, and that one cannot exist without the other. But when Beverly pursues a kinky, drug-addicted affair with the actress, his more self-controlled brother is helpless to prevent their mutual decline. In this wayDead Ringersbecomes a fascinating and stylistically clinical study of duality, and Cronenberg doesn't shy away from the dark and unpleasant aspects of the story. (One look at the movie's display of bizarre gynecological instruments and you'll know why women find this film particularly--and unforgettably--disturbing.)--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00JQYV0B4", "B0001XAKUQ", "B00009PY2T", "B00000F4MA", "B004SUDQ72", "0783228457", "B0000CDUT5", "B00AEFXR8I", "B005ZVIPG0", "B000056BP3", "B0009X768W", "B00LEW3L5Y", "B004ALIG4W", "B004ALIG1U", "B00009V7RV", "0780022629", "B00005B1ZK", "B00L3ZB7JO", "B00004ZBVO", "B003KGBIRK", "B00004W3HG", "B000CBG5PG", "B0002KPHZG", "B0007WFYC0", "B00B2BYXSG", "B0046ZYEVG", "B0001NBLX6", "B00005JKPT", "B00004Z1FM", "B004ALIG4M", "B000HT3QBE", "B001152TL6", "B00005QAPJ", "1559408677", "B00005EBSB", "B00KE3B6LU", "B000MNOXZ8", "B00GBT62PQ", "B000S0GYRU", "B0011U3OA6", "0780020707", "B00JVQ7QTM", "B000S0GYRK", "B001WLMOOG", "B00366F2NU", "B000A59Q4G", "B009ERK35W", "B00HT2RTU6", "B00KE3B6LA", "B00005NFZC", "B0001ZIYDO", "B00000IOKV", "B000069I09", "B001FOK70S", "B004ALIG0G", "078062856X", "B00K0MM4AM", "B004KDYR20", "B006PTL1QM", "B00005K9O8", "B000QXDFRQ", "B00KE3B6NI", "B00FF9SKQW", "B0007GAG42", "B0019X400I", "B001D8W7F4", "B000QQFKYE", "B003ELKNO0", "B009T3AE1Y", "B00GOT15IM", "B000BC8SWE", "B00005KH30", "B000127IF2", "B001JNNE1O", "B00004W457", "B00HE011DE", "B00JV054A6", "B000YENUI6", "B0000BUZKP", "B00BSN0VZ2", "B0000AINJ8", "B000ZM1MIM", "B00GPPXNLC", "B00005N7Z1", "B008CYDD7I", "B000I8OMEY", "B00HVOFP6W", "B00000IC7G", "B00IO9J5XW", "6305922756", "B000F3UA8E", "B001TK80CU", "0780023277", "0780022076", "B007N5YJMA", "B0053TWW9K", "B008220DGE", "B00125WATQ", "B001EIOOWC", "B00B2BYXTK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0783228457", "B00005K3NY", "B0000CDUT5", "B0009X768W"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 177136}, "asin": "1559408871", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4178D115ZEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dead Ringers (The Criterion Collection)"}
{"description": "Director Marty DiBergi (Rob Reiner) solemnly alerts us to the glory that was Spinal Tap in his introduction to this \"rockumentary\" about the legendary British heavy-metal group, featuring lead guitarist Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest), lead singer David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean), bassist Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer), and a succession of drummers whose careers were cut short by spontaneously combusting on their stool, drowning in somebody else's vomit, or otherwise perishing in untimely fashion. Under DiBergi's studious interrogation, the band and their familiars retrace the band's evolution from head-bopping Mersey Beat poseurs to head-banging metal poseurs, each change in musical direction or tonsorial chic having little effect on the surviving trio's sublime idiocy. For, as St. Hubbins (he's the \"deep\" one, relatively speaking) sagely observes, \"It's such a fine line between stupid and clever.\"Happily for us, director Reiner, who developed the underlying story line with Guest and former Credibility Gap pranksters McKean and Shearer, stays squarely on the right side of the line, even as his writer-actors remain hilariously trapped on the other side. In lieu of a formal shooting script, the quartet created an extensive and detailed band history ripe with the sort of dead-pan detail that hard-core rock historians and screwball aficionados will savor on countless replays; with the three Tap members also musicians themselves, the \"band\" developed its stage act under the unsuspecting noses of L.A. club denizens, who accepted them as just as loud, flashy, sexist, and obvious as any other mullet-tressed, leather-garbed brigade of guitar slingers, circa 1984. The resulting footage thus manages to lob its punch lines and build its characters (including some thinly veiled character assassinations of various industry folks) with a loose, tossed-away verve rooted in the improvisational approach.This Is Spinal Tapremains the funniest, and most truthful, look at rock culture ever filmed and a personal best for all involved.--Sam Sutherland", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 99031}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "This Is Spinal Tap (The Criterion Collection)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000ALFVD", "B00005ALS0", "B00005LC5D", "B000M341Q4", "B00005O3VC", "B000A7DVR2", "B00006HAWL", "B000VE439Y", "B00AEFXDO6", "B0000A02TZ", "B002RVZV9K", "B003CRM6PA", "B00004WGVQ", "B0009298N4", "B000A2UBNE", "B0009UC810", "B000LP6KNU", "B00006LPGP", "B00029RTCG", "B000055Y0X", "B0006GANPA", "B00003CXZ4", "B000MMMT9G", "B002DLB1IO", "B00006D295", "B00AEFYVMO", "B00007AJF8", "B00000ILDD", "B00003CXC3", "B00005A06N", "B0009IOR5M", "B0001Z4OXS", "B0000640VJ", "B004ALIG4M", "B000PAAJZ6", "B00005O06J", "B004L9GMBC", "B002HMHSJ0", "1559408677", "B0010YSD8Q", "B00AEFYR3C", "0780618564", "0767833988", "B004P9UWM8", "B003ELKNH2", "B000ROALGW", "B000HT3QBO", "B00000F3CD", "B0008JIJ2O", "B00005K3NU", "B000Z8GZYW", "B0024EWP6W", "B00008J2HC", "0780020707", "B001ECDVKE", "B000XJD33O", "B000CNESU8", "B000RJO578", "B000EGEJIY", "B000ZM1MG4", "0780622561", "B00BQTLVWK", "B00004ZBVO", "B00005B6JZ", "B000G6BLWE", "B0013K1ALE", "B0007UC8Y4", "B003XURDAY", "B0006GAOJA", "B00278FSXM", "0767827724", "B001IHJ988", "0783229526", "B000OHZKJA", "B001WLMOL4", "B000AP04L0", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00003CXGA", "B003YDORO0", "B00004YZFR", "B003O7I6SE", "6305161879", "B00AEBB9DM", "0783241895", "B00009OWJY", "B00005V0XF", "B000A2UBN4", "B002WJHBEU", "6304907729", "0783230338", "B0019UGYK0", "B000H7JCFK", "B000E33W1W", "B000069HZU", "B00H3JHH6Q", "B00AEFXJS6", "B00005JNZU", "B000067IZ3", "B00AEFXE9U", "B0009ZE9VW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005ALS0", "B0000ALFVD", "B000M341Q4", "B0018CMJSU"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71HEEMJV31L._SY300_.gif", "asin": "1559408758"}

{"description": "While most murderers try to hide from detectives, the killer inThe ABC Murderssends a series of letters to alert the famous Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot when and where the murders will be committed. Based on one of Agatha Christie's most ingenious plots, the film contains enough false clues to distract both detective and viewer from the murderer's true identity. As Poirot, David Suchet does not so much play the dapper detective as he inhabits him--his accent, his meticulous manners, and the scowl of concentration as his \"little gray cells\" solve the puzzle are all immediately familiar to readers of Christie's books. In this feature-length adventure, he is aided and abetted by his perennial sidekick, Captain Hastings (Hugh Fraser), and Chief Inspector Japp (Philip Jackson). Though Christie's novels spanned several decades, the PBSMystery!series has set all of its episodes in the 1930s; the art deco architecture and elegant costumes lend an air of sophistication that makes watching these videos a respectable guilty pleasure.DVD extras include biographies of David Suchet and Agatha Christie, challenging Poirot trivia questions, a filmography of all the PoirotMystery!episodes, and a link to the official Agatha Christie Web site.--Larisa Lomacky Moore", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000HHE8F4", "B00005KH4B", "B006JY3O2M", "B005X5XINI", "B00GWXI16O", "1569383626", "B000056C0O", "B000056C0I", "B005X5XI4C", "B004WMOSNM", "B00GWXHYPI", "B000CRR3EC", "B007ISJS0U", "B00005BGSC", "B00GWXI0S8", "B000068QOB", "0767028627", "B0083HXKM2", "B00AEFYO5I", "B00EF0NYVI", "B00005MM5G", "B00DW5IKWK", "B004HJ0ZLE", "B00GHH9I62", "B00005MM5H", "B003N2SUKY", "B0006212JK", "B00005QBZL", "B00D7AM2V0", "B0001ZWY76", "B00005RIX1", "B0000V472G", "B0023Y543Y", "B000AAAGJK", "B00008G8C1", "B00005RIWY", "B001KP2J3K", "0062073567", "B0000V4726", "B0028AENVC", "B003AND1TG", "B00GAXASLC", "B000065AYI", "B006Z4LP9K", "B00008DDXE", "B001V7YZAM", "B000CRR36K", "B0002TVWZ6", "B00H4ZEFTQ", "B001KP2J3U", "B0011VJRVU", "B0006HBJJ8", "B00BDSRM4K", "B0047CG95W", "B00023P44M", "B002MUAXJY", "B00068RYZK", "B00A0HT99G", "B00JAD6BYW", "B001KZOVJK", "B009DS5OEM", "B001KP2J44", "B000TVL2UC", "B00AATGDUC", "B00GWXI20E", "B00C12ZISE", "B00005RDRO", "B000A1IJS4", "B00C888LOO", "B00A27O5AW", "1611731607", "0553350358", "B000068QJU", "B001A640YU", "B000M1LYIY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000056C0I", "0062073567", "B004HJ0ZLE", "B000068QOE"]}, "price": 14.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 156846}, "asin": "1569383618", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417EX5S2F2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Agatha Christie's Poirot: The ABC Murders"}

{"description": "Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut's third feature, though it's named for the two  best friends who become virtually inseparable in pre-World War&nbsp;I Paris, is  centered on Jeanne Moreau's Catherine, the most mysterious, enigmatic woman in his career-long gallery of rich female portraits. Adapted from the novel by Henri-Pierre Roch&eacute;, Truffaut's picture explores the 30-year friendship between Austrian biologist Jules (Oskar Werner) and Parisian writer Jim (Henri Serre) and the love triangle formed when the alluring Catherine makes the duo a trio. Spontaneous and lively, a woman of intense but dynamic emotions, she becomes the axle on which their friendship turns as Jules woos her and they marry, only to find that no one man can hold her. Directed in bursts of concentrated scenes interspersed with montage sequences and pulled together by the commentary of an omniscient narrator, Truffaut layers his tragic drama with a wealth of detail. He draws on his bag of New Wave tricks for the carefree days of youth--zooms, flash cuts, freeze frames--that disappear as the marriage disintegrates during the gloom of the postwar years. Werner is excellent as Jules, a vibrant young man whose slow, melancholy slide into emotional compromise is charted in his increasingly sad eyes and resigned face, while Serre plays Jim as more of an enigma, guarded and introspective. But both are eclipsed in the glare of Moreau's radiant Catherine: impulsive, demanding, sensual, passionate, destructive, and ultimately unknowable. A masterpiece of the French New Wave and one of Truffaut's most confident and accomplished films.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["1572524448"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 485144}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.97, "brand": "", "asin": "1572525851", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NEMNZZ25L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jules and Jim [VHS]"}

{"description": "This splatter flick, along with John Carpenter'sHalloween, helped spawn the great horror-movie movement of the '80s, not to mentioneightsequels, many of which had nothing to do with the films that preceded them. It also gave birth to Jason Voorhees, one of the three biggest horror-movie psychos of the modern era (the other two beingHalloween's Michael Myers andA Nightmare on Elm Street's Freddy Krueger). Forever duplicated, the originalFriday the 13thpopularized a number of themes and techniques that today are now clich&eacute;s: the increasingly gory murders, the remote forest location, the anonymous and nubile cast, the murderer as cult hero, and, of course, the moral that if you have sex, you will die, very painfully. Still, if you have to see aFriday the 13thmovie, this is the one to check out. A group of eager (and horny) teenagers decide to reopen Camp Crystal Lake, which 20 years earlier was closed after the shocking and mysterious murders of two amorous camp counselors. You can take it from there, as the teens get picked off one by one, during a dark and stormy night; of course, their car won't start and there's no phone. The ending stole shamelessly from Brian De Palma'sCarrie, but it still provides a slight if campy shock. Look for a young Kevin Bacon as the requisite stud--you can tell that's what he is because when the cast appears in swimsuits, he's wearing a Speedo--who's the beneficiary of the film's best murder sequence, an arrowhead to the throat. Right after having sex, of course.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300214192", "6300214311", "6300189015", "6300214605", "B00023NRSM", "6301589025", "6301094352", "6300218058", "6302921058", "6305095566", "630428845X", "6300214656", "6300267881", "0792839234", "6304288433", "B00000JQTO", "6304136242", "0780627032", "6302038308", "6302975832", "0792846311", "6303917283", "6301562925", "0784011923", "0790705141", "B000AMW2TK", "B00005B238", "0783216084", "0764005693", "B0013D8LAE", "6304509154", "630130053X", "B000VKL6Z2", "630196666X", "6303396585", "B00IF8Q0YE", "6303579388", "6300182878", "6303265715", "6304983794", "6300214176", "6302180015", "6304361025", "6304509146", "6300262855", "B00008HCCJ", "0792836634", "6302516919", "6300146383", "6303257879", "B0000039A6", "6303265693", "B009CSVQOU", "B00000JQTR", "6300147630", "6301574117", "0783235607", "6300214672", "6300213714", "6304370458", "630026999X", "6305363668", "6303257674", "6301427076", "6302798450", "6304910010", "6305814694", "6300262731", "0792835018", "6301024443", "0792110285", "6300268993", "6304508611", "B0000VCZMU", "6300182975", "6304113404", "1558807381", "6303920098", "6300182339", "B00000IQUT", "B00004RNAC", "6300185249", "6300987744", "0792845684", "6300183181", "B00000F0I2", "6302797632", "0792846303", "0792839242", "B0009A2PQI", "6300181642", "0764006770", "0792836677", "B00004WLXE"], "also_viewed": ["6302921058", "6300214192", "6300214311", "B00023NRSM", "6300214605", "6300214656", "6301094352", "6301589025", "0780627032", "6304288433", "6300218058", "6300189015", "B00AZ7V0W0", "B0002JP572", "630428845X", "6305095566", "0792839234", "B00DEQQK8S", "0792836634", "6303824382", "0767817664", "B00078XGO2", "6300182878", "6303265693", "B000RIWAVW", "0792116887", "B000VKL6Z2", "6304508611", "B002YICNE2", "6301562925", "B00ETHN9L2", "B00AEFY22I", "0451150899", "6301792734", "B00GHH9IIA", "6304509154", "B000FS9FE4", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B005CM1IES", "6301794982", "6301708695", "6300267881", "B00008HCCJ", "6300181278", "6303422020", "6304983794", "0783235607", "6300214176", "6303579388", "6305399409", "B00005B6ND", "6304240562", "6302814359", "630274461X", "B00D7AM71A", "0792839242", "6301589955"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 232095}, "asin": "6300214087", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71PWYF6B3GL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Friday the 13th 1 [VHS]"}
{"description": "The movie that made \"No wire hangers!\" a household phrase,Mommie Dearestis the very model of a modern \"camp classic,\" so crazily outlandish that it's fascinating. Based on the scathing and scandalous tell-all bestseller by Christina Crawford, the adopted daughter of histrionic Hollywood movie queen Joan Crawford,Mommie Dearestwas billed in advance as a serious dramatic motion-picture biography. But it turned out to be something much, much weirder--a genuine Hollywood oddity that serves up a bizarre mixture of melodramatic trash and outrageous tragi-comedy. Joan Crawford won an Oscar for playing the role of the self-sacrificing mother, the woman who would do anything for her daughter, inMildred Pierce. As depicted by Faye Dunaway (playing the hell out of the role as if she's determined to win another Oscar of her own, damn it!), her role as offscreen parent puts her in a league with big-time scary screen mommies such as Mrs. Bates inPsycho, and Angela Lansbury's &uuml;ber-mom inThe Manchurian Candidate. Dunaway's Crawford torments and terrorizes her adopted children in myriad ways--making them give away their own birthday gifts and rousting them from their beds for frantic after-midnight bathroom-scrubbing attacks. And when, after the death of her Pepsico chairman husband, Crawford tells the board of directors, \"Don't f--- with me, fellas!\" one is very much inclined to heed her warning.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301706587", "6301977963", "B004LWZW4M", "B000005XPV", "6304359721", "6301973410", "B000003KE0", "B00005RERY"], "bought_together": ["6301977963"], "also_viewed": ["0767903579"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 304567}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.67, "brand": "", "asin": "6300213919", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N957ZKB0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mommie Dearest [VHS]"}
{"description": "The quintessential movie spoof that spawned an entire genre of parody films, the originalAirplane!still holds up as one of the brightest comedic gems of the '80s, not to mention of cinema itself (it ranked in the top 5 ofEntertainment Weekly's list of the 100 funniest movies ever made). The humor may be low and obvious at times, but the jokes keep coming at a rapid-fire clip and its targets--primarily the lesser lights of '70s cinema, from disco films to star-studded disaster epics--are more than worthy for send-up. If you've seen even one of the overblownAirportmovies then you know the plot: the crew of a filled-to-capacity jetliner is wiped out and it's up to a plucky stewardess and a shell-shocked fighter pilot to land the plane. Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty are the heroes who have a history that includes a meet-cute &agrave; laSaturday Night Fever, a surf scene right out ofFrom Here to Eternity, a Peace Corps trip to Africa to teach the natives the benefits of Tupperware and basketball, a war-ravaged recovery room with a G.I. who thinks he's Ethel Merman (a hilarious cameo)--and those are just the flashbacks! The jokes gleefully skirt the boundaries of bad taste (pilot Peter Graves to a juvenile cockpit visitor: \"Joey, have you ever seen a grown man naked?\"), with the high (low?) point being Hagerty's intimate involvement with the blow-up automatic pilot doll, but they'll have you rolling on the floor. The film launched the careers of collaborators Jim Abrahams (Big Business), David Zucker (Ruthless People), and Jerry Zucker (Ghost), as well as revitalized such B-movie actors as Lloyd Bridges, Peter Graves, Robert Stack, and Leslie Nielsen, who built a second career on films like this.

But who cares?Roman Holidayis the film that brought Audrey Hepburn to prominence, and the world movie audience went weak at the knees. The endlessly charming Hepburn had her first starring role in this sweet romance, playing a European princess on an official tour through Rome. Frustrated by her lack of connection to the real world, she slips away from her protective handlers and goes on a spree, aided by a tough-guy news reporter (Gregory Peck). Director William Wyler, more at home with such heavy-going, Oscar-winning classics asThe Best Years of Our LivesandBen- Hur, doesn't always keep the champagne bubbles afloat, and the Peck role would have fit Cary Grant like a silk glove. But the film is great fun, the location shooting is irresistible, and Hepburn embodies an image of chic style that would rule for the rest of the fifties.

{"description": "A sweet and subtle gem of a movie. Newly orphaned Addie (Tatum O'Neal) falls into the care of small-time con artist Moses Pray (Ryan O'Neal, Tatum's real-life father) and turns out to be better at grifting than he is. Set in Depression-era Kansas,Paper Moonis a miracle of unity. The set design and cinematography combine to give both the flavor of documentary photos and the visual quality of movies from the period, and every performance meshes with the overall tone of sincerity, earnest optimism, and creeping desperation. The rapport between Addie and Moses is phenomenal--and being father and daughter doesn't make that a sure thing. Ryan O'Neal gives a truly great performance (perhaps the only one of his career) and Tatum won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress (she's the youngest winner in history). Madeline Kahn was also nominated for her wonderfully funny and sad turn as an exotic dancer named Trixie Delight.Paper Moonhas a miraculous combination of outrageous sentimentality and pragmatic cynicism; the result is genuinely touching.

{"description": "This 1986 comedy out of Australia is so old-fashioned in its romantic charm that one can't help but wonder what it would have looked like with Clark Gable and Carole Lombard in the leads. On the other hand, it's hard to imagine anyone besides Paul Hogan as the title character, a laid-back Aussie tracker who shows an American reporter (Linda Kozlowski) around bush country, then accompanies her to New York City. Sure, Hollywood has done the fish-out-of-water scenario to death in the last 20 years, and while this film has sufficient sport with the gimmick, it is largely driven by the principal characters and their developing love affair. Hogan cowrote the script and director Peter Faiman evokes the goofy, enchanted air of screwball comedies.

{"description": "AfterThe Exorcistsparked a lengthy trend of supernatural thrillers, this 1976 horror film scored a hit with critics and audiences for mixing gothic horror and mystery into its plot about a young boy suspected of being the personification of the anti-Christ. (No doubt it's a favorite of shock-rocker  Marilyn Manson.) Directed by Richard Donner (best known for hisSupermanandLethal Weaponfilms),The Omengained a lot of credibility from the casting of Gregory Peck and Lee Remick as a distinguished American couple living in England, whose young son Damien bears \"the mark of the beast.\" Mysterious deaths and unexplained incidents draw the attention of a photographer (David Warner), whose investigation leads to the young boy--and also to the photographer's shocking decapitation (in a scene that has since been inducted into the horror hall of fame). At a time when graphic gore had yet to dominate the horror genre, this film used its violence discreetly and to great effect, and the mood of dread and potential death is masterfully maintained. It's all a bit hokey, with a lot of biblical portent and sensational fury, but few would deny it's highly entertaining.  Jerry Goldsmith's Oscar-winning score works wonders to enhance the movie's creepy atmosphere.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300247147", "6300267881", "B00004TS0H", "6304508611", "0792846303", "6300247333", "B00096S48U", "0792836634", "B00005B238"], "bought_together": ["6300247147"], "also_viewed": ["6300247147", "B000AMW2TK", "6300247333"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 237731}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.9, "brand": "", "asin": "6300247104", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41QZ2BFBRFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Omen [VHS]"}
{"description": "George Lucas's enigmatic feature film debut expands on a student film he made at USC.  Created under the wing of producer Francis Ford Coppola, this movie is a bleak vision of a world in which technology, not man, is the ultimate dictator.  Efficiency overrides every other aspect of human life, as people are reduced to code names and their lives are contained, monitored, and manipulated for the sake of the system. Featuring unsettling performances by Robert Duvall, Donald Pleasance, and Maggie McOmie,THX 1138does not attempt to explain how things became this way; rather, it utilizes the alienation of its characters, the stifling white-on-white imagery of its sterilized society, and the claustrophobic, droning sound design to emphasize the dangers of a world reliant on soulless technology.  Even though this is not a film one will want to take in repeatedly,THX 1138merits attention because it is that rare film that uses images and sounds--rather than relying heavily on  dialogue--to communicate its dark prophecy.--Bryan Reesman", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0040QYROA", "B003XURDAY"], "also_viewed": ["B00E9PMMX0"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 290492}, "asin": "6300269329", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512ZKWBXT9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Thx1138 [VHS]"}

He plays a computer specialist who is hired by a criminal mastermind (Robert Vaughan) to help him take on Superman by exposing him to a new form of Kryptonite: red Kryptonite, which always had unpredictable effects in the comic books. In this film, it splits Superman in two, dividing his good self from his dark side.

{"description": "A perfect example of what critic Manny Farber once described as \"termite art\"--that which burrows under and gets inside its subject rather than indulging in rhetoric--HELL IS FOR HEROES stars Steve McQueen as the rebellious G.I. John Reese. In the fall of 1944, he's busted from staff sergeant back to private for drunkenness and is sent back to his former outfit, currently stationed near the Siegfried Line in Montigny. Reese's bitterness about his demotion isolates him from the rest of the squad, although they've observed his courage under fire in previous combat missions. When the unit is assigned to defend an area facing a German pillbox, Reese's skills become evident. He advises squad leader Sgt. Larkin (Harry Guardino) on a ruse that creates the illusion that their unit is much larger than it is, temporarily deflecting an attack. The squad has been ordered to simply hold their ground, but believing it's only a matter of time before the Germans discover that they've been deceived, Reese leads an attack on the pillbox. McQueen is excellent in this solid, realistic grunt's-eye-view of combat, which suggests that sociopaths make the best soldiers. James Coburn and Mike Kellin do fine work, and Bob Newhart is featured in a strangely anomalous comic turn.", "related": {"also_viewed": ["0792115449"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 216710}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.5, "brand": "", "asin": "6301608534", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HBQP3SJCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hell Is for Heroes [VHS]"}

{"description": "After a scalding first reel in big-city night streets, Nicholas Ray'sOn Dangerous Ground(RKO, 1951) forsakes familiar noir terrain for the countryside--the mountains and snowfields where city cop Robert Ryan seeks a psychotic killer. For both the actor and the director, Ryan's character is an exemplary creation: a man with personal demons whose overzealous pursuit of criminals has pushed him into sadism. His passage from urban darkness into the silent white mountain country becomes a redemptive journey, thanks largely to his interaction with a blind woman (Ida Lupino) in an isolated farmhouse whose younger brother may be the quarry he's after. Ray developed the screenplay with A.I. Bezzerides under the supervision of producer John Houseman (for whom Ray had made his feature debut,They Live by Night). The film boasts a thrilling music score by Bernard Herrmann, anticipating his great soundtrack forNorth by Northwest.--Richard T.

{"description": "Many early science fiction films are now, quite inadvertently (and in most cases undeservedly), objects of camp attention: we laugh at the silly makeup, tin-can special effects, and the naive \"high-tech\" dialogue.Planet of the Apesis no such film. Its intelligent script, frightening costuming, and savagely effective conclusion (which needs no big-budget special effects to augment its impact) remain both potent and relevant. When Colonel George Taylor (the fabulous Charlton Heston) crash lands his spacecraft on what seems to be an unfamiliar planet, he is captured and held prisoner by a dominant race of hyperrational, articulate apes. However, the ape community is riven with internal dissention, centered in no small part on its policy toward humans, who, on this planet, are treated as mindless animals. Befriended and ultimately assisted by the more liberal simians, Taylor escapes--only to find a more terrifying obstacle confronting his return home. Heavy-handed object lessons abound--the ubiquity of generational warfare, the inflexibility of dogma, the cruelty of prejudice--and the didactic fingerprints of Rod Serling are very much in evidence here. But director Franklin Schaffner has a dark, pop-apocalyptic sci-fi vision all his own, and time has not dulled the monumental emotional impact of the film's climactic payoff shot. If you don't know what I'm talking about here, you owe it to yourself to check out this stone classic, and even if you do, see it with fresh eyes; and don't be surprised if you get the chills all over again... and again... and again.--Miles Bethany", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301661761", "6301661710", "6304457316", "6303148352", "0783222955", "6301327845", "B00000JS61", "6304196911", "079284517X"], "bought_together": ["6301661710"], "also_viewed": ["B005FHWWXQ", "6305076146", "6301661710", "B00003CXXU", "B000K7VHHS", "B00004ZBGJ", "B000E6ESG2", "B00005KH32", "B000IJ79UW", "B00004ZBGC", "6301792734", "B001G7Q10Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 314709}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.84, "brand": "", "asin": "6301661729", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512998ZRQ3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Planet of the Apes [VHS]"}

{"description": "A flawed but stylish adaptation of the Chester Gould comic strip by director Warren Beatty, who also stars in the title role. The minimalist plot involves a battalion of baddies who confront the intrepid detective in a series of strung-together vignettes. Al Pacino is a comedic if overblown standout as Big Boy Caprice, and Madonna simply smolders as aggressive blonde bombshell Breathless Mahoney. It matters not that the plot is Spartan, as this dazzling eye candy is much enhanced by Stephen Sondheim's songs, including the Academy Award-winning ditty, \"Sooner or Later (I Always Get My Man).\" Beatty took his cue from the source material and concentrated on the relationships between these people, whether strained, romantic, or hateful. The performances are subtle and more amusing than you would expect from such a visually bold picture. Shot in bright, primary colors, this also won Oscars for Best Art/Set Direction and Makeup (for those inventively hideous criminals).

{"description": "Louisa May Alcott's beloved story is one of the most-read novels ever written. It has also proved popular film and telefilm fodder (at least six versions plus a TV series). In addition,Little Womenis one of those rare literary projects that can truly be done well on screen. This, the 1933 version, chronicles the lives and loves of sisters Jo, Meg, Amy, and Beth (played, respectively, by Katharine Hepburn, Frances Dee, Joan Bennett, and Jean Parker). It's a superior rendering to the amiable, perky 1949 version with June Allyson, Janet Leigh, Elizabeth Taylor, Margaret O'Brien, and Peter Lawford, and comparable to the beautiful, feminist Gillian Armstrong 1994 take. Douglass Montgomery's Laurie isn't nearly as dreamy as Christian Bale's (1994), but the lack of chemistry between him and Hepburn's Jo is perfect for the story, in which Jo loves him like a brother. Jo's real love she offers up to perhaps the finest Professor Bhaer (Paul Lukas). Character actress Edna May Oliver is at her indignant best as Aunt March. Director George Cukor's vision is elegant, warm, and as true to the original source material as 117 minutes allows.

Spencer Tracy is the tough city editor who goes to some spectacular extremes when socialite Myrna Loy files a $5 million libel suit against his paper for calling her a notorious home-wrecker; he hires celebrated ladies' man William Powell to seduce Loy and asks his long-suffering fianc&eacute;e, Jean Harlow, to marry Powell temporarily so she can play the wronged wife when Loy and Powell are discovered together. The couples crisscross, with frenetic and not entirely unpredictable results, but much of the pleasure here lies in seeing these iconic stars being so thoroughly themselves.

{"description": "The third of five screen versions ofOwen Wister's noveland playThe Virginianis the only one that merits classic status. It's not a masterpiece, mind you, and not a great Western. But itisa landmark in the genre for defining some archetypal characters and situations, and for certifying the stardom of a key Western icon, Gary Cooper.You could say this 1929 movie hasn't aged well: the pace is spavined, the dialogue groans like a rickety ladder, and Cooper's pancake makeup occasionally leaves him looking like an eye-batting odalisque. Yet in other ways the film's datedness feels like validation. From the vantage of the 21st century, this movie was made nearly as long ago as the era it describes, and the roughhewn town buildings, the absence of a music score, and the glimmering light (it always seems to be just after sunrise or just before sunset) all belong to a privileged moment, an unspoiled, vanished world.That feeling is never stronger than in the great and terrible centerpiece of the film, the hanging of the rustlers--including one of the most sympathetic characters we have come to know. This is a harrowing sequence, the more so for being played matter-of-factly, even tenderly. And the climactic showdown in the streets of Medicine Bow is pretty fine, too. With Walter Huston, newly in from Broadway in his first Hollywood role, as that snake-in-the-grass Trampas; Richard Arlen as Steve; Mary Brian as the new schoolmarm; and frog-voiced Eugene Pallette, not yet too swollen to sit a horse, enhancing the new world of sound as Honey Wiggin.--Richard T.

{"description": "Writer-director Sam Raimi's extremely stylized, blood-soaked follow-up to his creepyEvil Deadisn't really a sequel; rather, it's a remake on a better budget. It also isn't really a horror film (though there are plenty of decapitations, zombies, supernatural demons, and gore) as much as it is a hilarious, sophisticated slapstick send-up of the terror genre. Raimi takes every horror convention that exists and exaggerates it with mind-blowing special effects, crossed with mocking Three Stooges humor. The plot alone is a genre clich&eacute; right out of any number of horror films. Several teens (including our hero, Ash, played by Bruce Campbell in a manic tour-de-force of physical comedy) visit a broken-down cottage in the woods--miles from civilization--find a copy of the Book of the Dead, and unleash supernatural powers that gut every character in sight. All, that is, except Ash, who takes this very personally and spends much of the of the film getting his head smashed while battling the unseen forces. Raimi uses this bare-bones story as a stage to showcase dazzling special effects and eye-popping visuals, including some of the most spectacular point-of-view Steadicam work ever (done by Peter Deming). Although it went unnoticed in the theaters, the film has since become an influential cult-video favorite, paving the way for over-the-top comic gross-out films like Peter Jackson'sDead Alive.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305095566", "6302798450", "B00023NRSM", "6303257879", "0790705141", "6304983794", "6302921058", "6300214087", "B000WC3864", "6300182878", "0783227434", "6300262731", "6302088607", "6300181987", "B000005XXG", "B0001VL30O", "B000007PI9", "6303396585", "6304288433", "6300213714", "6303579388", "6300189015", "0792836685", "6300214192", "6301094352", "0783235607", "0783246641", "6304451024", "0790741512", "0792845684", "630428845X", "6300214311", "0767825411", "0792836634", "6300262855", "6302814359", "B00000I4R9"], "bought_together": ["6305095566", "6302798450"], "also_viewed": ["B00IF8Q0YE", "6305095566", "6302798450", "6300182878", "B000RIWAVW", "6301208536", "0792839234", "6302921058"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 222150}, "asin": "6302038308", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z%2BYIlqC1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Evil Dead II [VHS]"}

{"description": "Now and forever a favorite among kids, this 1990 comedy written by John Hughes (The Breakfast Club) and directed by Chris Columbus (Mrs. Doubtfire) ushered Macaulay Culkin onto the screen as a troubled 8-year-old who doesn't comfortably mesh with his large family. He's forced to grow a little after being accidentally left behind when his folks and siblings fly off to Paris. A good-looking boy, Culkin lights up the screen during several funny sequences, the most famous of which finds him screaming for joy when he realizes he's unsupervised in his own house. A bit wooden with dialogue, the then-little star's voice could grate on the nerves (especially in long, wise-child passages of pure bromide), but he unquestionably carries the film. Billie Bird and John Candy show up as two of the interesting strangers Culkin's character meets. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are entertainingly cartoonish as thieves, but the ensuing violence once the little hero decides to keep them out of his house is over-the-top.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302765536", "6304932553", "B0000A02WC", "0767825411", "6300214753", "6303314015", "079070546X", "B00000490M", "B0000048S1", "6303049079", "6303506291", "B00000JKNP", "630442972X", "6300269639", "6302824729", "6301570723", "0784011923", "6304117752", "6303442447", "B00005JKDQ", "B0000AQZYM", "6302914469", "B00005B6ND", "6300263673", "6304089767", "0788812408", "6300183181", "6303344224", "B00000JGEI", "6305814694", "6301792734", "0783216084", "0790731436", "6303148352", "6302787068", "6304209266", "6303215734", "630018403X", "6300213668", "B00005LOUS", "B0002F6BQU", "6304500831", "B00006G8LB", "6301969707", "B000641D2Y", "6303269966", "6304030959", "630179513X", "6302705517", "0790742322", "6302794331", "B000059XY5", "078881172X", "6303338690", "155890641X", "6302526574", "6303446590", "6303540082", "6301827732", "6302374189", "6303236863", "0800196767", "6301569385", "B00008X5J8", "6302968143", "6300215814", "B00000JS61", "6301966988", "B00003CX7L", "6304416415", "6302178924", "B000MUANT6", "080013558X", "B0000BWVBD", "B00008DZ83", "6302518393", "B000TJBN6W", "6304118937", "6300183467", "6304291698", "6302453356", "6300214370", "6300214710", "6303168957", "0793941520", "B00000F8J1", "6303109918", "6303929680", "0792133153", "B00023BLXA", "6304093381", "B000005PFL", "B000R3KOWE", "6302409365", "6303347657", "6305537798", "6303212263", "B00000GUNY", "0780623711"], "bought_together": ["6302765536", "6304932553"], "also_viewed": ["0767825411", "6302765536", "6304932553", "0788812408", "B00006CXK5", "6302426200", "6303212379", "6303314015", "6302453356", "B001DDBD5E", "6301404440", "B0007KTBIU", "6301792734", "6304117752", "6302787068", "6302968143", "079070546X", "B000A468XY", "B00003CX8I", "6302526574", "6302320402", "0788805533", "B00003CXI0", "6305940932", "B0000A02WC", "0788805843", "6303148352", "6304500831", "B00005JKDQ", "6305750750", "6304401132", "6304400551", "6302921228", "B00005JL95", "0307142450", "6303315305", "6303442447", "6304501153", "B000009CTR", "0800125789", "0783216084", "6303212395", "0784011923", "6304089767", "6302481805", "B0000AK7AB", "0790700506", "6304873441", "6304143184", "630339406X", "B0000AQZYM", "6305326940", "B000035Z2S", "B0000524CZ", "0788802194", "B00005LOUS", "B00005B238", "6303036813", "6304434340"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 209060}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.87, "brand": "FOX Video", "asin": "6302091632", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GTF7T3ZPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Home Alone [VHS]"}

{"description": "This charming Disney live-action picture is a genuine sleeper. It's a variation on the old boy-runs-away-to-join-the-circus story, except this time the boy is a girl. After she joins a traveling show in the 1930s, spunky teen Sonora Webster (Gabrielle Anwar) learns the ropes and eventually lands a plum role in the program: riding a horse off a 40-foot-high diving board into a tank of water. Well, Sonora thinks it's a plum, anyway.Wild Hearts Can't Be Brokenhas the usual love interest, a brush with tragedy, and some worldly wisdom (the latter doled out by old pro Cliff Robertson, in a nice role as a crusty barnstormer). What makes the movie memorable is the performance of the lovely Gabrielle Anwar, the doe-eyed actress who later danced the tango so memorably with Al Pacino inScent of a Woman. The movie may be sappy--no surprise with that title--but Anwar provides bright star wattage and a plucky role model.--Robert Horton", "related": {"bought_together": ["6303244440"], "also_viewed": ["B00062IVN0", "B000P0J0DS", "6301792734", "B00AEFYM2S", "B00006ZXSK", "6305106959", "6302900190", "B001ASQ9OM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 187661}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6302274001", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513JC99SXDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken [VHS]"}
{"description": "Australian model George Lazenby took up the mantle of the world's most suave secret agent when Sean Connery retired as James Bond--prematurely, it turned out. Connery returned inDiamonds Are Foreverbefore leaving the role to Roger Moore and Lazenby's subsequent career fizzled, yet this one-hit wonder is responsible for one of the best Bond films of all time.InOn Her Majesty's Secret Service, 007 leaves the Service to privately  pursue his SPECTRE nemesis Blofeld (played this time by Telly Savalas), whose latest master plan involves a threat to the world's crops by agricultural sterilization. Bond teams up with suave international crime lord Draco (Gabriele Ferzetti) and falls in love with--and marries--his elegant daughter, Tracy (Diana Rigg). Bond goes monogamous? Not at first; after all he has Blofeld's harem to seduce. Lazenby hasn't the intensity of Connery but he has fun with his quips and even lampoons the Bond image in a playful pre-credits sequence, and Rigg, fresh from playing sexy Emma Peel inThe Avengers, matches 007 in every way. Former editor Peter Hunt makes a strong directorial debut, deftly handling the elaborate action sequences--including a car chase turned road rally through the icy snow--with a kinetic finesse and a dash of humor. Though not a hit on its original release,On Her Majesty's Secret Servicehas become a fan  favorite and the closest the series has come to capturing the spirit of Ian Fleming's books.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["630238060X", "6302380294", "6302510023", "6302510015", "6302510007", "B0000068SI", "6302380588", "6302510031", "6303651488", "6303651461", "630251018X", "B000006FNX", "6304047843", "6305784906", "6302510198", "630251004X", "B00004TYS8", "B00008V2VP", "B000M53GMW", "B000RPCK1U", "6304032579", "B00004RWUH", "6304038801", "B000RPCK24", "B000RPCK1A", "B000M53GN6", "B000NDEXPM", "B000M53GMC", "B000M53GNG", "B000M53GLS", "B001PPLIEG", "B000NIBUS0", "B00AQSN7HE", "B000M53GM2", "B000RPCK0Q", "B000RPCK1K", "6302824613", "630150528X", "6304429274", "6302482712", "6303202004"], "bought_together": ["6302380294"], "also_viewed": ["6302380588", "6302510015", "B00004TYS8", "B00004W9C7"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 167907}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.44, "brand": "", "asin": "6302380596", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZCDSK1KML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "On Her Majesty's Secret Service [VHS]"}

Ripley, the only survivor of her past mission, awakens on a prison planet in the far corners of the solar system. As she tries to recover, she realizes that not only has an alien gotten loose on the planet, the alien has implanted one of its own within her. As she battles the prison authorities (and is aided by the prisoners) in trying to kill the alien, she must also cope with a distinctly shortened lifespan that awaits her. But the striking imagery makes for muddled action and the script confuses it further.

{"description": "Gene Wilder takes his most unusual role, a naive 19th-century rabbi sent from his native Poland to the fledgling Jewish community in San Francisco, in this warm-hearted comic adventure. The trusting soul is easy prey for the con men and criminals who prey on the immigrants arriving in the Philadelphia port and the rabbi, beaten but unbowed, continues his trek West solo: broke, underequipped, and hopelessly lost. Harrison Ford, fresh fromStar Wars, is the roguish outlaw who adopts the determined traveler and the two become unlikely friends as they make their way through one scrape after another. Wilder makes a sincere and sympathetic hero, his faith and courage seeing him through one crisis after another, and fresh-faced Ford makes an endearing scamp of a bank robber. The meandering adventure, overlong at two hours, takes its time as the duo traverses the gorgeous American countryside and end up in the bustling Barbary Coast San Francisco of the Gold Rush era. Legendary hard-edged action director Robert Aldrich (Kiss Me Deadly,The Dirty Dozen) brings a gentle touch and easygoing humor to this family-oriented adventure, but old habits die hard. While staying within PG parameters, Aldrich adds a little grit to the Old West fistfights and gunfights.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300216012", "B00004R67T", "6300271781"]}, "price": 9.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 293104}, "asin": "6302816408", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TJ425EYXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Frisco Kid [VHS]"}
{"description": "Certain to remain one of the greatest haunted-house movies ever made, Robert Wise'sThe Haunting(1963) is antithetical to all the gory horror films of subsequent decades, because its considerable frights remain implicitly rooted in the viewer's sensitivity to abject fear. A classic spook-fest based on Shirley Jackson's novelThe Haunting of Hill House(which also inspired the 1999 remake directed by Jan de Bont), the film begins with a prologue that concisely establishes the dark history of Hill House, a massive New England mansion (actually filmed in England) that will play host to four daring guests determined to investigate--and hopefully debunk--the legacy of death and ghostly possession that has given the mansion its terrifying reputation.Consumed by guilt and grief over her mother's recent death and driven to adventure by her belief in the supernatural, Eleanor Vance (Julie Harris) is the most unstable--and therefore the most vulnerable--visitor to Hill House. She's invited there by anthropologist Dr. Markway (Richard Johnson), along with the bohemian lesbian Theodora (Claire Bloom), who has acute extra-sensory abilities, and glib playboy Luke Sanderson (Russ Tamblyn, from Wise'sWest Side Story), who will gladly inherit Hill House if it proves to be hospitable. Of course, the shadowy mansion is anything but welcoming to its unwanted intruders. Strange noises, from muffled wails to deafening pounding, set the stage for even scarier occurrences, including a door that appears tobreathe(with a slowly turning doorknob that's almost unbearably suspenseful), unexplained writing on walls, and a delicate spiral staircase that seems to have a life of its own.The genius ofThe Hauntinglies in the restraint of Wise and screenwriter Nelson Gidding, who elicit almost all of the film's mounting terror from the psychology of its characters--particularly Eleanor, whose grip on sanity grows increasingly tenuous. The presence of lurking spirits relies heavily on the power of suggestion (likewise the cautious handling of Theodora's attraction to Eleanor) and the film's use of sound is more terrifying than anything Wise could have shown with his camera. Like Jack Clayton's 1961 chiller,The Innocents,The Hauntingknows the value of planting the seeds of terror in the mind, as opposed to letting them blossom graphically on the screen. What you don't see is infinitely more frightening than what you do, and with nary a severed head or bloody corpse in sight,The Hauntingis guaranteed to chill you to the bone.--Jeff Shannon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 433958}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6302872766", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5169GTZZBNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Haunting [VHS]"}

{"description": "This absolutely charming, wholly engaging romantic comedy is the hidden gem of the four collaborations of Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant. Most everyone's seenThe Philadelphia Story, but few know of this unorthodox, hilarious comedy of life among the rich and privileged, though both were Broadway hits by playwright Philip Barry. Grant plays the happy-go-lucky Johnny Case, a self-made man with a dream in his heart of making just enough money to retire on and then traveling around the world. Johnny proposes to the lovely Julia (Doris Nolan) in Lake Placid, but it isn't until he comes to pay her a visit in New York that he discovers she's the daughter of a wealthy industrialist. Although his nonconformity ruffles the feathers of Julia's stuffy father, he's soon won over the whole family--most notably, Julia's rebellious sister Linda (Hepburn), who in becoming Johnny's greatest advocate finds herself irresistibly drawn to him. There's more going on here than a spiffy, surface romance, with Johnny's free-spirit determination going up against rock-hard establishment values, and director George Cukor plays up the social politics of the story just as well as the wonderful, exquisite romance. Hepburn and Grant, as always, are perfectly paired, and given able support by Lew Ayres as the black sheep of Hepburn's family, and Edward Everett Horton and Jean Dixon as Grant's longtime pals. Filmed previously in 1930; Hepburn understudied the role of Linda on Broadway and used a scene from the play in her first screen test.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000040EO", "6302990076", "630150528X", "0792839846", "6302227127", "6304383177", "0782006779", "6302305950", "630310245X", "6302208920", "6303102441", "6301278437", "6304525125", "6302798434", "6301328531", "B000PYKZYC", "6304056958", "6303333079", "6302725542", "0792840836", "B0000049FG", "6302484448", "6301973267", "0790744759", "6301987845", "1559838450", "B006P0UQ2G", "630266232X", "630299005X", "6301964012", "6303364772", "0783215096", "6301670140", "B00005LMA7", "6304111398", "6302011035", "6301798503", "0792837630", "6301967410", "0792837649"], "also_viewed": ["B008D1Q1VU", "B000A8AX6I"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 332020}, "asin": "630290899X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510FZJEFSHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Holiday [VHS]"}

In essence, the facts surrounding a rape and murder are told from four different and contradictory points of view, suggesting the nature of truth is something less than absolute. The cast, headed by Kurosawa's favorite actor, Toshiro Mifune, is superb.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303202055", "6302969352", "1572522089", "0783217528", "6301661737", "6302066891"], "bought_together": ["6302969352", "6303202055"], "also_viewed": ["1572522089"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 331252}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6303073107", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SS885243L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rashomon [VHS]"}

{"description": "The postwar vogue for documentary-style realism, prompted byThe March of Timeand the critical success of Roberto Rossellini'sOpen City, cross bred with film noir to create a compelling strain of crime films; this is one of the most low-key and credible, based on the true story of a Chicago reporter (James Stewart) who became convinced of the innocence of a death-row inmate (Richard Conte). Director Henry Hathaway (whoseKiss of Deathstarted the trend) stages the action on the actual Chicago locations, providing a fascinating documentary record of an underfilmed metropolis (the convict's mother is a washerwoman at the Wrigley Building), and leads his cast to appropriately restrained, naturalistic performances. Stewart is just beginning to explore his newfound, postwar maturity here, and there's an undercurrent of obsessiveness in his performance that anticipates the haunted figures he would soon be playing for Anthony Mann and Alfred Hitchcock.--Dave Kehr", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302700949", "630345786X", "6301973410", "0792837371"]}, "price": 17.73, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 388547}, "asin": "6303102506", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FRZSC8B1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Call Northside 777 [VHS]"}
{"description": "It's better than the 1994 remake starring Kim Basinger and husband Alec Baldwin, but this 1972 thriller relies too heavily on the low-key star power of Steve McQueen and Ali MacGraw, and the stylish violence of director Sam Peckinpah, reduced here to a mechanical echo of his former glory. McQueen plays a bank robber whose wife (MacGraw) makes a deal with a Texas politician to have her husband released from prison in return for a percentage from their next big heist. But when the plan goes sour, the couple must flee to Mexico as fast as they can, with a variety of gun-wielding thugs on their trail. MacGraw was duly skewered at the time for her dubious acting ability, but the film still has a raw, unglamorous quality that lends a timeless spin to the familiar crooks-on-the-lam scenario. As always, Peckinpah rises to the occasion with some audacious scenes of action and suspense, including a memorable chase on a train that still grabs the viewer's attention. Not a great film, but a must for McQueen and Peckinpah fans.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302757096", "0790733897", "6303039693", "6300213838", "6303282237", "630434256X", "6301971426", "6301976622", "0792845684", "0792838548", "630196733X", "6300247031"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 393115}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.96, "brand": "", "asin": "6303111874", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B3ZC6THYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Getaway [VHS]"}
{"description": "This Western has become a modest cult favorite since its release in 1993, when the film was met with mixed reviews but the performances of Kurt Russell (as Wyatt Earp) and especially Val Kilmer, for his memorably eccentric performance as the dying gunslinger Doc Holliday, garnered high praise. The movie opens with Wyatt Earp trying to put his violent past behind him, living happily in Tombstone with his brothers and the woman (Dana Delany) who puts his soul at ease. But a murderous gang called the Cowboys has burst on the scene, and Earp can't keep his gun belt off any longer. The plot sounds routine, and in many ways it is, but Western buffs won't mind a bit thanks to a fine cast and some well-handled action on the part ofRambodirector George P.

{"description": "Ranking just behind the best of animator Don Bluth's films (AnastasiaandThe Secret of NIMH),Thumbelinais a bubble-light version of Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale. The finger-sized heroine goes about the old-fashioned trials of trying to find a good man, but the film is clever enough to make it endearing for the 3-6 set and more than passable for adult viewers. Barry Manilow provides much of the song score, which helps immensely. The ballad \"Let Me Be Your Wings\" is as good as Disney's best.

Forsyth is attempting nothing less thanThe Ages of Man, using Williams as his representative of humanity through history. Cast as a kind of Everyman, Williams plays a guy who can't seem to get his family situation straightened out to his satisfaction, whether he's trying to protect his family from Vikings in prehistoric times, being a nomad in the Middle Ages, or showing up as an unhappy divorced guy in contemporary times who's trying to reconnect with his teenage daughter. It's worth a look, if only for the opportunity to see how a big idea can go decidedly wrong and to observe what happens when a director gets a hold of an unworkable concept that he believes in completely.

Then again you may not.The Goonies, like Donner's other movies, is the same story of good versus evil. It has its share of bad guys (the Fratelli brothers and their villainous mother), reluctant-hero good guys (the Walsh bothers and their gang of friends), and lots of corny one-liners. Like in an old-fashioned Hardy Boys or Nancy Drew plot, the Goonies need to solve a problem: a corrupt corporate developer has bought out their neighborhood and plans to flatten all their homes.

{"description": "This completely absorbing three-hour documentary follows the lives of two inner-city African American teenage basketball prodigies as they move through high school with long-shot dreams of the NBA, superstardom, and an escape from the ghetto. Taking cues from such works as Michael Apted's35 Up, director Steve James and associates shot more than 250 hours of footage, spanning more than six years, and their completed work actually moves like an edge-of-the-seat drama, so brimming with tension, plot twists, successes, and tragedies that its length--170 minutes--is never an issue. Yet, what makes the film more impressive is how James moves his scope beyond a competitive sports drama (although the movie has plenty of terrific, nail-biting basketball footage) and addresses complex social issues, creating a scathing social commentary about class privilege and racial division. The film opens by introducing William Gates and Arthur Agee, two Chicago hopefuls, as they are being courted and recruited by various high schools to play ball, and continues until the pair are college freshmen. James allows the audience the experience of not only watching their journeys and daily routines (it's a sobering portrait of inner-city life), but also witnessing their maturation. Each takes a separate path along the way, stumbling over several obstacles (William suffers injuries, Arthur fails to meet his coach's high expectations); but James takes particular care to stress the importance and strong commitment of each character's family along the way, giving the film a essential center. The parents and siblings emerge with as much depth and complexity as the two main \"characters,\" and turnHoop Dreamsinto an unforgettable film experience.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002YMWQ2M", "B001FB55NK"], "bought_together": ["B002YMWQ2M", "B001FB55NK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 350631}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6303413145", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y10FZ6VPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hoop Dreams [VHS]"}

But Merivel blows it by falling in love with the woman, and he is cast out of his pampered paradise to reinvent himself as a serious man helping victims of the plague beyond the palace's walls. It's a superb notion, and the film looks just terrific, particularly Charles's court, where scientific and artistic innovation flourishes.

The nail-biting set piece--always a signature of director De Palma (Carrie,The Untouchables)--in which Cruise is lowered from the ceiling to retrieve information from a computer in a high-security vault--is an instant classic.

{"description": "Having developed his skill as a master of contemporary crime drama, writer-director Michael Mann displayed every aspect of that mastery in this intelligent, character-driven thriller from 1995, which also marked the first onscreen pairing of Robert De&nbsp;Niro and Al Pacino. The two great actors had played father and son in the separate time periods ofThe Godfather, Part&nbsp;II, but this was the first film in which the pair appeared together, and although their only scene together is brief, it's the riveting fulcrum of this high-tech cops-and-robbers scenario. De&nbsp;Niro plays a master thief with highly skilled partners (Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore) whose latest heist draws the attention of Pacino, playing a seasoned Los Angeles detective whose investigation reveals that cop and criminal lead similar lives. Both are so devoted to their professions that their personal lives are a disaster. Pacino's with a wife (Diane Venora) who cheats to avoid the reality of their desolate marriage; De&nbsp;Niro pays the price for a life with no outside connections; and Kilmer's wife (Ashley Judd) has all but given up hope that her husband will quit his criminal career. These are men obsessed, and as De&nbsp;Niro and Pacino know, they'll both do whatever's necessary to bring the other down. Mann's brilliant screenplay explores these personal obsessions and sacrifices with absorbing insight, and the tension mounts with some of the most riveting action sequences ever filmed--most notably a daylight siege that turns downtown Los Angeles into a virtual war zone of automatic gunfire. At nearly three hours, the film qualifies as a kind of intimate epic, certain to leave some viewers impatiently waiting for more action, but it's all part of Mann's compelling strategy.Heatis a true rarity: a crime thriller with equal measures of intense excitement and dramatic depth, giving De&nbsp;Niro and Pacino a prime showcase for their finely matched talents.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000003KHS", "6300183211", "B00000IO4G", "630018627X", "6303421563", "B00000JGEI", "6302415853", "630018403X", "0800199421", "6304258984", "0784011923", "6304259131", "6302482712", "6303953425", "B00007CVYA", "0783223218", "6300214540", "6302054982", "0790731274", "B00000ILE6", "0792147618", "079073799X", "6301208773", "6301888901", "0790701251", "0792133153", "6302378648", "6302282535", "6305718792", "6304414099", "6303696813", "0790748169", "B0002ZDVFE", "B000077VT7", "6303269834", "6302516919", "630428649X", "B00008R9K9", "6303036570", "6302814782", "0792116887", "0792158261", "0790705141", "6304508611", "6301071379", "B00005Q4GY", "076783819X", "6300214567", "6303020089", "6303383300", "6302945089", "B0002GTWOM", "B00003CXE6", "0792841778", "6301797930", "0800116917", "0800179552", "B0000040EJ", "B00005A7VC", "6300182878"], "also_viewed": ["B000003KHS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 286071}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.98, "brand": "", "asin": "6304214502", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4160ZFH45VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Heat [VHS]"}

{"description": "John Travolta's should've-been-nominated-for-an-Oscar performance is the best reason to see this largely moving work, which is a little reminiscent of the novelFlowers for Algernon(basis for the filmCharly). Travolta plays a mechanic who sees a bright light in the sky one night and wakes up the next morning a genius, hungry for knowledge and so smart he figures out national defense secrets in his own living room (and gets in hot water for it). The more interesting drama, however, is not with the government but with the character's longtime neighbors and friends, who come to reject him for being different. Robert Duvall gives a stirring performance as a doctor who has known the hero all his life, and Kyra Sedgwick is very good as an ambivalent love interest. If you missed this one in the theaters, then you haven't seen one of Travolta's best performances since his comeback.

{"description": "Billy Bob Thornton wrote, directed, and starred in this mesmerizing drama with haunting overtones ofTo Kill a Mockingbird. Thornton plays a mentally retarded man who has spent 20 years in a psychiatric hospital for killing his mother and her lover. Released into the community from which he came, he befriends and protects a lonely boy regularly harassed and abused by his mom's boyfriend (a terrific performance by Dwight Yoakam). The story is ultimately about sacrifice, but Thornton certainly doesn't get twinkly about it. Some of the best material concerns the hero's no-big-deal efforts to integrate into a \"normal\" life: working, eating fast food, earning admiration for his handyman skills, and attaining a semblance of community among other damaged souls.

Dick short story &quot;We Can Remember It for You Wholesale,&quot;Total Recallwas originally conceived of with Richard Dreyfuss starring as a Walter Mitty-like character who experiences a variety of artificially induced fantasies. The movie we know is a mega-budget action epic set on Mars.  Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a normal working man who discovers that his entire reality has been invented to conceal a plot of planetary domination. Oscar-winning special effects and violent action propel the twisting plot, in which Arnold manipulates his manipulators in a world of dazzling high technology. Director Paul Verhoeven (Robocop) indulges his usual penchant for gratuitous bloodshed, but the movie has enough cleverness to rise above its excesses.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AKGG828", "B000RW3VCK", "B00005N5S5", "B000056PMU", "B000BPL2FQ", "B00026ZG10", "1558908846", "B0002J58HO", "B00005JA8B", "B001VLBDD0", "B002GHHHME", "B005LAII3A", "B0045HCJGC", "B0000VD12I", "6305767866", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B000FC2FQA", "B000RJO56E", "B001TK80C0", "0783225504", "B0001Z37HM", "B00004Y87O", "B00005N7Z1", "B00005JKIP", "B005COLETU", "0783241895", "B00013RC8E", "B00007AJG4", "0783226926", "B00AEFYDM2", "B001FB55HQ", "0800195175", "B003XURDAY", "B00004XMSC", "B000OVLBHG", "B00IZZDWKM", "B0045HCJ5S", "B000U1ZV8K", "B009YQJ322", "B0002CHK1S", "6304602944", "B00004STDN", "B002ZG98LO", "0783225946", "B0006GANOQ", "B0045HCJT4", "B00005JL78", "B000QUCQX8", "B00008G8LY", "B00005JMZK", "B001B3LIOC", "B0004Z33EG", "B00I9TDMRM", "B0002S94CK", "B000U1ZV62", "B00005JN0T", "B0045HCJG2", "B0000542CD", "B000U1ZV4Y", "B000E5N684", "B0000VCZK2", "B0000844I8", "B00008G8M4", "B004P7CN5O", "B0004Z33EQ", "B00006RCOC", "B000O77SRC", "6304806434", "B000RRS7RE", "B002ZG999U", "B00000G3PA", "B004P3HA8I", "B000QUCRB4", "B00003CWU3", "B00BLF9FOK", "B002VWNIDG", "B005LAIHXQ", "B00005JKFR", "B0009X768W", "B000GUJYQ0", "B000FI8MPW", "B0045HCJFS", "B001OST0M6", "B00AEBB99Q", "B002UZCJ8Y", "B000P0J0AQ", "6305258287", "B000NTMA0Q", "B00005JNTI", "B002VWNID6", "B00005JM5B", "B008JFUO36", "6304711891", "B000O77SRM", "B000QXDCLU", "B00008G8M5", "B00000ILDD", "B0000AOX0F", "0780622650", "B0007PALZ2"], "bought_together": ["B00026ZG10"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005LAII3A", "B00005JA8B", "B001JFZ118", "B001VLBDD0"]}, "price": 19.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 88004}, "asin": "6304490135", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51D88Q82WTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Total Recall"}

{"description": "Winner of the 1997 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, this charming Czech drama uses the backdrop of the Russian military occupation in Prague for its funny, sad, and ultimately delightful story of a 55-year-old man's friendship with a 5-year-old boy. It doesn't exactly start out as friendship: Louka is a cellist who lost his symphony job after writing a sarcastic remark on an official form, and although he's struggling financially he still enjoys the company of several young women who find him irresistibly sexy. The last thing he needs is a surrogate child, but that's what he gets when young Kolya is abandoned by his mother, a Russian woman Louka had agreed to marry so she could avoid being sent back to Russia. The mother runs off to her boyfriend in Germany, leaving Louka with a 5-year-old kid who only speaks Russian! As directed by Jan Sver&aacute;k (whose father, Zdenek Sver&aacute;k, plays Louka), this predicament offers a lovingly detailed account of how Louka and Kolya discover each other, and how their mutual awkwardness evolves into a heartwarming father-son relationship. While the Russian presence creates an atmosphere of suspicion and restriction, the deepening connection between Louka and Kolya turns this into an unforgettable film, beautifully photographed, sensitively performed, and directed with just the right combination of subtle sentiment and harsh reality. Its Oscar was definitely well deserved.--Jeff Shannon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 394678}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.35, "brand": "", "asin": "6304554168", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518KWY5H7AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Kolya [VHS]"}
{"description": "You have a classic tale full of drama, passion, and adventure. A tale of universal archetypes that speak to everyone. A tale that has remained unfailingly popular for thousands of years. Why not spice it up with a wacky mechanical owl? Such was the thinking behindClash of the Titans. Maggie Smith, Laurence Olivier, and Harry Hamlin (one of these things is not like the others...) star in a toga-ripper about a valiant hero, capricious immortals, and lots and lots of giant stop-action monsters. Perseus (Hamlin) is the favored son of the god Zeus (Olivier), but he has unwittingly ticked off the sea goddess Thetis (Smith). Just to make things worse, Perseus falls in love with the lovely Princess Andromeda, who used to be engaged to Thetis's son. Soon Perseus is off on one quest after another, with Zeus helping, Thetis hindering, and lots of innocent bystanders getting stabbed, drowned, and squished. Of course, the whole thing is just an excuse to show as much of Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion animation as possible, and good thing too.

{"description": "On his evening commute, bored accountant Sugiyama (Koji Yakusho) always looks for the beautiful woman who gazes wistfully out the window of the Kishikawa School of Dancing. One night he gets off the train, walks into the studio, and signs up for a class. Soon Sugiyama is so engrossed in his dancing he practices his steps on the train platform and under his desk, and becomes good enough for competition, compelling his wife to hire a private investigator to find out why he stays out late and returns home smelling of perfume. Among the colorful characters Sugiyama meets is his coworker Aoki (Naoto Takenaka), who transforms himself from geeky systems analyst to hilariously flamboyant (and bad-wigged) lounge lizard. Aoki explains to Sugiyama, \"When I finish work, put on the clothes, the wig and become Donny Burns, Latin world champion, and I start to move to the rhythm, I'm so happy, so completely free.\" Here lies the chief charm ofShall We Dance, the contrast between the ultracompetitive women of the studio--including the one who caught Sugiyama's eye, Mai (Tamiyo Kusakari)--and the men who dance simply because they enjoy it. This 1996 film is somewhat comparable to the flamboyant Aussie favoriteStrictly Ballroom, butShall We Danceis especially noteworthy for contrasting the boldness of social dance with the buttoned-up societal mores of Japan, where people avoid public displays of emotion. Even in Japan, the joy of dance is irresistible.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"bought_together": ["B004SIP9VA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 195577}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.9, "brand": "", "asin": "6304798466", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5116JAH4H6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Shall We Dance?

{"description": "Asian American director Ang Lee sums up America in the early 1970s by focusing on the arrival of the sexual revolution in the 'burbs. Isolationism within a family, consumerism, and selfishness are personified by a cast that captures the self-obsession within two New England families. As the children struggle awkwardly with adolescence, their parents stumble through sexual experimentation. In the days of Watergate and Vietnam, society is breaking boundaries and ignoring convention. Following suit, these families are eschewing polite barriers and social taboos, with disastrous results. The \"ice storm\" of the title refers not only to a natural phenomenon but is a (rather heavy-handed) metaphor for a pervasive emotional temperament. The entire cast delivers textured, finely nuanced performances. This movie lingers in the psyche not only for the scope of the tragedy at its conclusion, but for Lee's often humorous and stingingly accurate assessment of pop culture. Based on Rick Moody's novel, this won the best-screenplay award at Cannes in 1997.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 146644}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6304844964", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4125A7MPSWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ice Storm [VHS]"}

{"description": "It may not be a disaster movie, per se, but this terminally silly thriller is certainly disastrous, and would be pointless without the novelty of its setting in a flooding Midwestern town during a torrential rainfall. Physically impressive but idiotic in every other respect, the movie pits an armored truck courier (Christian Slater) against a smart leader of thieves (Morgan Freeman) and a corruptible town sheriff (Randy Quaid) who are vying for possession of $3 million in cash. A waterlogged game of cat and mouse, the plot is so contrived that even the most impressive action sequences--such as a jet-ski chase through flooded high-school corridors--are robbed of their already tenuous credibility. Before long you'll be yawning as incompetent accomplices are systematically dispatched by their own stupidity, in the kind of movie where the use of power boats inevitably leads to at least one death by outboard motor.

In a role that catapulted her to international stardom, Nicole Kidman plays a young wife who's joined her husband (Sam Neill) on a yachting trip to recover from the tragic death of their son. Far out to sea, they encounter a sinking ship with one survivor (Billy Zane, ten years beforeTitanic), but inviting him aboard turns out to be a very bad mistake. While Neill attempts to salvage the sinking boat, Kidman is fighting for her life against the psychotic Zane--a villain so creepy that you eagerly look forward to his demise. By the time that moment arrives director Phillip Noyce has resorted to a typical slasher-movie climax (proving that no boat should be without a flare gun), but until thenDead Calmis a nail-biting thriller that's guaranteed to keep you in a state of nail-biting suspense.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0045O2PHS", "B00000IQC2", "B00004Y87P", "B000067J3P", "B000A2UBN4", "B000085EFG", "B001HN6968", "B0043X1FNQ", "B000065V3P", "B00AEFXKZ8", "6305213305", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B00002E23C", "0767802616", "B002AT8KAG", "B00B4HM6XW", "B004P7CMUU", "B00009WVSL", "B00JF5GAIW", "B00005JPUN", "0767810872", "B0013D8LKO", "B000068QPV", "B002NZK5RI", "B0007P0X9G", "B00AEFYUQQ", "B00013RC66", "0792844874", "6305308837", "B00004U2K1", "B000LC3IE2", "B0043X1FLS", "B006YTGLE0", "B00004Y87L", "6305310335", "B00151QYXU", "B00015YVDG", "B00AEBBA2W", "B0013F5L0K", "B0002DB52M", "B00004RF85", "B00005K3NU", "B0002DB54A", "B0006HBZXS", "B00008CMRK", "B00064AE0G", "6305133476", "B00AEFXBPM", "B0000VJG72", "B00H83EUQW", "B000NO1XG8", "0792846443", "B000EZ9084", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000069HZP", "6304765258", "B00005Y1UX", "0783222149", "B00005JNQA", "B00005OBBD", "0783226810", "B00GST8U4U", "B00005R5GD", "B000NO3DLG", "0790730979", "B0009X76XC", "B000P0J0C4", "B00007AJE1", "6305213283", "B004AE3QYE", "B00AEFYD9K", "0767817729", "B00IKM5MIA", "B0001US62I", "B002GHHHN8", "B0045HCJFS", "B00013RC84", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B000PHVZNE", "B00IBKXSKA", "B009R8Q8Y8", "B000EHSVNW", "B00005JN0W", "B00005BCKF", "B000I2J736", "0767809726", "0783110871", "B00005Y1UV", "B00006L91I", "B0018QPPXW", "B000CNESTE", "B00005U14H", "B00006RCNY", "B0000C3I96", "B00005JLQN", "B00006L92K", "B004SIP92O", "B0000AZT79", "0783229402"], "bought_together": ["B00000IQC2", "B000065V3P"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000085EFG", "B00000IQC2", "B0045O2PHS", "B00004Y87P"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 86274}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 27.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "6305161933", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/7184H9PXBXL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Dead Calm"}

The story of a girl for whom a bad stroke of luck is no match for her internal strength and purity of heart. Drew Barrymore plays Cinderella's alleged inspiration, Danielle, in this romantic drama that purports to tell the \"facts\" behind the Grimm brothers' story. One of three daughters of a man (Jeroen Krabb&eacute;) who dies and leaves her fate in the hands of a conniving stepmother (Anjelica Huston), Danielle is cast into the lowly role of a servant. Meanwhile, her sisters are evaluated as possible mates for a French prince (Dougray Scott), but he's far more intrigued with Danielle's intelligence and beauty--not to mention her way with a sword and fist. Directed by Andy Tennant (who directed Barrymore in TV'sThe Amy Fisher Story),Ever Afterhas that rare ability to win the heart and mind of a viewer simply by being committed to its own innocence, particularly where Barrymore's luminous performance is concerned.

{"description": "There was such a magic on the screen in 1995 when the people at Pixar came  up  with the first fully computer-animated film,Toy Story. Their second feature film,A Bug's Life, may miss the bull's-eye but Pixar's target is so lofty, it's hard to find the film anything less than  irresistible.Brighter and more colorful than the other animated insect movie of 1998  (Antz),A Bug's Lifeis the sweetly told story of Flik  (voiced by David Foley), an ant searching for better ways to be a bug. His  colony unfortunately revolves around feeding and fearing the  local grasshoppers (lead by Hopper, voiced with gleeful menace by Kevin  Spacey). When Flik accidentally destroys the seasonal food supply for the grasshoppers he decides to look for help (\"We need bigger bugs!\"). The ants, led by Princess Atta (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), are eager to dispose of the troublesome Flik. Yet he finds help--a hearty bunch of bug warriors--and brings them back to the colony. Unfortunately they are just traveling performers afraid of conflict.As withToy Story, the ensemble of creatures and voices is remarkable and often inspired. Highlights include wiseacre comedian Denis Leary as an un-ladylike ladybug, Joe Ranft as the German-accented caterpillar, David Hyde Pierce as a stick bug, and Michael McShane as a pair of unintelligible pillbugs. The scene-stealer is Atta's squeaky-voiced sister, baby Dot (Hayden Panettiere), who has a big sweet spot for Flik.More gentle and kid-friendly thanAntz,A Bug Life'sstill  has some good suspense and a wonderful demise of the villain. However,  the film--a giant worldwide hit--will be remembered for its most  creative touch: \"outtakes\" over the end credits &agrave; la many  live-action comedy films. These dozen or so scenes (both \"editions\" of  outtakes are contained here) are brilliant and deserve a special  place in film history right along with 1998's other most talked-about  sequence: the opening Normandy invasion inSaving Private Ryan.The video also contains Pixar's delightful Oscar-winning short,Geri's Game.

{"description": "For years, conventional wisdom has had it that Ed Wood Jr.'sPlan 9 from Outer Spaceis the ultimate \"bad movie,\" a sort of Holy Grail of cinematic ineptitude. Often lost in the shuffle, though, isBride of the Monster(fans of Tim Burton's biopicEd Woodwill already be familiar with it and the offscreen misadventures that went along with it). Bela Lugosi plays Dr. Vornoff, a mad scientist working on a race of superbeings in his lab. His process of  clamping a metal lampshade onto the heads of his subjects and zapping them with radiation usually kills them, but the monstrous Lobo (Tor Johnson) survives and becomes Vornoff's assistant. Vornoff's plans go awry, though, when he tries to get a nosy reporter to mate with Lobo and winds up being given the atom treatment himself. Suffice it to say that there's a grappling match between Vornoff and Lobo until the evil doctor falls into a pit and wrestles a rubber octopus. Stock footage of lightning and an atomic explosion round things out for a great non sequitur of an ending. Knowing Bela Lugosi's sad state by the time that he and Ed Wood had teamed up makes it hard to watch this movie without feeling a pang of pathos for the 73-year-old actor; indeed,Bridewas his last speaking role. Still, any movie with as many obvious gaffes in direction, editing, set design, narrative (heck, take your pick) asBrideis a must for any connoisseur of bad movies.--Jerry Renshaw", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 990779}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 2.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6305389284", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VAZSWN3ML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bride of the Monster [VHS]"}

{"description": "Robert Clayton Dean (Will Smith) is a lawyer with a wife and family whose happily normal life is turned upside down after a chance meeting with a college buddy (Jason Lee) at a lingerie shop. Unbeknownst to the lawyer, he's just been burdened with a videotape of a congressman's assassination. Hot on the tail of this tape is a ruthless group of National Security Agents commanded by a belligerently ambitious fed named Reynolds (Jon Voight). Using surveillance from satellites, bugs, and other sophisticated snooping devices, the NSA infiltrates every facet of Dean's existence, tracing each physical and digital footprint he leaves. Driven by acute paranoia, Dean enlists the help of a clandestine former NSA operative named Brill (Gene Hackman), andEnemy of the Statekicks into high-intensity hyperdrive.Teaming up once again with producer Jerry Bruckheimer,Top Gundirector Tony Scott demonstrates his glossy style with clever cinematography and breakneck pacing. Will Smith proves that there's more to his success than a brash sense of humor, giving a versatile performance that plausibly illustrates a man cracking under the strain of paranoid turmoil. Hackman steals the show by essentially reprising his role fromThe Conversation--just imagine his memorable character Harry Caul some 20 years later. Most of all, the film's depiction of high-tech surveillance is highly convincing and dramatically compelling, making this a cautionary tale with more substance than you'd normally expect from a Scott-Bruckheimer action extravaganza.--Jeremy Storey", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790732149", "B002AS464Q", "B002AT8K9W", "B000JYW5BE", "6304765258", "B00AEFXYJA", "B001NY4WYC", "B002NZK5UU", "B00008G8M4", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000NTMA0Q", "B0045HCJFS", "B002AT8KA6", "0790736411", "0783226888", "6304806434", "B00015YVDG", "6304711891", "B000CEV3M8", "B00005JN0T", "B00000G3PA", "B003ASLJIQ", "B005LAIGRS", "B001L57ZYM", "B00005JKMQ", "B000OT6V0K", "B00005ATZT", "B0007KIFGE", "B000055Y0Y", "B000QUCRB4", "B00096S49Y", "0767803434", "B004IK30MI", "B00AEFYW64", "B000B8GT92", "B00005JL78", "B000ENC5YW", "B00005UQ9T", "B001B3LIOC", "B002NZK5R8", "B000VG66XS", "B00008OE4W", "B000EGDB10", "B00008K76U", "B00003CXFV", "6304884400", "B000GFLKF8", "B00AEBB8LA", "B00AEFXIIW", "B002NZK5VO", "B00008K76W", "B002GOAH1A", "B00BTYOYG2", "B002GHHHME", "B00014NEZI", "0783240295", "B000P5FH3K", "B003O7I6SE", "B00005JPD0", "B007FQXEWI", "B004EPYZP8", "B00005JA9F", "B000035P5V", "B002DU39GW", "B003BV8I3Q", "0783232098", "B00AEBB86U", "6305428506", "B001TODCII", "B00003CXGV", "0780618548", "B002AT8KAG", "B00AP2DC94", "B00AEFXBG6", "B00026ZG10", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B0006GANOQ", "B000E0WJLE", "B00441GYXI", "B00005B6JZ", "B00A2H9P98", "B00004ZBVG", "B003A12WBQ", "B00011CZRE", "B0013J55B6", "B00AEFYUQQ", "0792844874", "B00006HAWN", "0792159659", "B00AEBB9UK", "0790730979", "B00009WVSL", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B000059TFO", "B0045HCJ8K", "B00006JDVT", "0783225733", "B000E5KURY", "B00029RT9E", "B000TGJ8CQ"], "bought_together": ["B002AS464Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["6304765258", "B00008G8M4", "B005LAIGRS", "B003ASLJIQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3843}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "Buena Vista", "asin": "6305428115", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QR8SZKK7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Enemy of the State"}

{"description": "It's, like, Shakespeare, man! This good-natured and likeable update ofThe Taming of the Shrewtakes the basics of Shakespeare's farce about a surly wench and the man who tries to win her and transfers it to modern-day Padua High School. Kat Stratford (Julia Stiles) is a sullen, forbidding riot grrrl who has a blistering word for everyone; her sunny younger sister Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) is poised for high school stardom. The problem: overprotective and paranoid Papa Stratford (a dryly funny Larry Miller) won't let Bianca date until boy-hating Kat does, which is to say never. When Bianca's pining suitor Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) gets wind of this, he hires the mysterious, brooding Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger) to loosen Kat up. Of course, what starts out as a paying gig turns to true love as Patrick discovers that underneath her brittle exterior, Kat is a regular babe. The script, by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith, is sitcom-funny with peppy one-liners and lots of smart teenspeak; however, its cleverness and imagination doesn't really extend beyond its characters' Renaissance names and occasional snippets of real Shakespearean dialogue. What makes the movie energetic and winning is the formula that helped makeShe's All Thatsuch a big hit: two high-wattage stars who look great and can really act. Ledger is a hunk of promise with a quick grin and charming Aussie accent, and Stiles mines Kat's bitterness and anger to depths usually unknown in teen films; her recitation of her English class sonnet (from which the film takes its title) is funny, heartbreaking, and hopelessly romantic. The imperious Allison Janney (Primary Colors) nearly steals the film as a no-nonsense guidance counselor secretly writing a trashy romance novel.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303853102", "6302998611", "6302787068", "6301796535", "B00006RCST", "630018403X", "6300183467", "6302091632", "0800109481", "6300214753", "6302968100", "6300263673", "6304978286"], "also_viewed": ["B005HY1P94"]}, "price": 10.53, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 177740}, "asin": "6305537798", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/712HBPMSPEL._SY300_.gif", "title": "10 Things I Hate About You [VHS]"}

{"description": "OK, let's get all the disclaimers out of the way first. Despite its colorful (if crude) animation,South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncutis in no way meant for kids. It is chock full of profanity that might even make Quentin Tarantino blanch and has blasphemous references to God, Satan, Saddam Hussein (who's sleeping with Satan, literally), and Canada. It's rife with scatological humor, suggestive sexual situations, political incorrectness, and gleeful, rampant vulgarity. And it's probably one of the most brilliant satires ever made. The plot: flatulent Canadian grossmeistersTerrance and Philip hit the big screen, and the South Park quartet of third graders--Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman--begin repeating their profane one-liners ad infinitum. The parents of South Park, led by Kyle's overbearing mom, form \"Mothers Against Canada,\" blaming their neighbors to the north for their children's corruption and taking Terrance and Philip as war prisoners. It's up to the kids then to rescue their heroes from execution, not mention a brooding Satan, who's planning to take over the world.To give away any more of the plot would destroy the fun, but this feature-length version of Trey Parker and Matt Stone's Comedy Central hit is a dead-on and hilarious send-up of pop culture. And did we mention it's amusical? From the opening production number \"Mountain Town\" to the cheerful antiprofanity sing-along \"It's Easy, MMMKay\" to Satan's faux-Disney ballad \"Up There,\" Parker (who wrote or cowrote all the songs) brilliantly shoots down every earnest musical fromBeauty and the BeasttoLes Mis&eacute;rables. And in advocating free speech and satirizing well-meaning but misguided parental censorship groups (with a special nod to the MPAA),Bigger, Longer & Uncuthits home against adult paranoia and hypocrisy with a vengeance. And the jokes, while indeed vulgar and gross, are hysterical; we can't repeat them here, especially the lyrics to Terrance and Philip's hit song, but you'll be rolling on the floor. Don't worry, though--to paraphrase Cartman, this movie won't warp your fragile little mind.

{"description": "Noted for intimate character studies created in collaboration with his actors, director Mike Leigh makes a dramatic change of pace with this biography of comic opera composers W.S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan. Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) is an easily angered but otherwise emotionally remote lyricist who works in collaboration with composer Sullivan (Alan Corduner), a genial and fun-loving sort who feels unsatisfied writing light operettas and longs to work with more serious material. While Sullivan is having a creative crisis, Gilbert is facing a failing marriage to Lucy (Lesley Manville), who loves her husband even if he can't return her affections, and must deal with his ailing father (Charles Simon). When they suffer their first failure, both men are depressed, and Sullivan announces that he's giving up operetta for good. However, a visit to an exhibit of Japanese art sparks an idea in Gilbert, and soon he and Sullivan are hard at work on what will become one of their greatest successes, The Mikado. Much of the film is devoted to the staging of this classic, with Shirley Henderson, Dorothy Atkinson, Martin Savage, Timothy Spall, and Kevin McKidd as members of the operetta's cast. Jim Broadbent won Best Actor at the 1999 Venice Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi\n\nR, 2 hr. 40 min.\nDrama, Musical & Performing Arts, Art House & International, Comedy\nDirected By: Mike Leigh\nWritten By: Mike Leigh\nIn Theaters: Dec 17, 1999 Limited", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 373514}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.41, "brand": "", "asin": "6305882010", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q6RXY94VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Topsy Turvy [VHS]"}
{"description": "Bicentennial Manwas stung at the 1999 box office, due no doubt  in part to  poor timing during a backlash against Robin Williams and his treacly  performances in two other, then-recent releases,Jakob the LiarandPatch  Adams. But this near-approximation of a science fiction epic, based on  works by Isaac Asimov and directed, with uncharacteristic seriousness of  purpose, by Chris Columbus (Mrs.&nbsp;Doubtfire), is much better than  one would have known from the knee-jerk negativity and box-office indifference.Williams plays Andrew, a robot programmed for domestic chores and sold to an  upper-middle-class family, the Martins, in the year 2005. The family  patriarch (Sam Neill) recognizes and encourages Andrew's uncommon  characteristics, particularly his artistic streak, sensitivity to beauty,  humor, and independence of spirit. In so doing, he sets Williams's tin man on  a two-century journey to become more human than most human beings.As adapted by screenwriter Nicholas Kazan, the movie's scale is  novelistic, though Columbus isn't the man to embrace with Spielbergian  confidence its sweeping possibilities. Instead, theHome Alonedirector shakes off his familiar tendencies to  pander and matures, finally, as a captivating storyteller. But what really  makes this film matter is its undercurrent of deep yearning, the passion of Andrew as a convert to the human race and his willingness to sacrifice all to  give and take love. Williams rises to an atypical challenge here as a  futuristic Everyman, relying, perhaps for the first time, on his considerable  iconic value to make the point that becoming human means becoming more like Robin Williams.

{"description": "John Lasseter and his gang of high-tech creators at Pixar create another entertainment for the ages. Like the few great movie sequels,Toy Story&nbsp;2comments on why the first one was so wonderful while finding a fresh angle worthy of a new film. The craze of toy collecting becomes the focus here, as we find out Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) is not only a beloved toy to Andy but also a rare doll from a popular '60s children's show. When a greedy collector takes Woody, Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) launches a rescue mission with Andy's other toys. To say more would be a crime because this is one of the most creative and smile-inducing films since, well, the firstToy Story.Although the toys look the same as in the 1994 feature, Pixar shows how much technology has advanced: the human characters look more human, backgrounds are superior, and two action sequences that book-end the film are dazzling. And it's a hoot for kids and adults. The film is packed with spoofs, easily accessible in-jokes, and inspired voice casting (with newcomer Joan Cusack especially a delight as Cowgirl Jessie). But as the Pixar canon of films illustrates, the filmmakers are storytellers first. Woody's heart-tugging predicament can easily be translated into the eternal debate of living a good life versus living  forever.Toy Story&nbsp;2also achieved something in the U.S. two other outstanding 1999 animated features (The Iron Giant,Princess Mononoke) could not: it became a huge box-office hit.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304089767", "B00005JKDQ", "B0000AQZYM", "6305326940", "0788805843", "0788812408", "155890641X", "6303314015", "0788802194", "B000035Z2S", "0788805533", "6305229449", "078881172X", "6304500831", "0788812807", "6302526574", "6302642248", "6303983812", "B00003CXQX", "6304401132", "0788806270", "6302787068", "6305940932", "6302320402", "6304290888", "6303534422", "B00275EHJG", "B00004T2SI", "6305319138", "B00005JL95", "0788803743", "6302178924", "6300274268", "6304100507", "6305942285", "B00004R99N", "6300275310", "B00006CXK5", "B00003CXXI", "B00005JMQY", "6304400225", "6304400551", "6302961572", "6303122647", "6304501153", "B00005JKX3", "0788811002", "6300274195", "B0000E32WB", "6303929338", "B00005T7H6", "6304978286", "B00005RDVV", "B00016JF2W", "6302158095", "B0000524CZ", "6304401736", "B000035Z46", "B00003CXHR", "0788812440", "6303036813", "6304089201", "B0007A2GSM", "B00000JS61", "B000028U3S", "B00005RRG3", "6301991311", "B00003CWPW", "B00009L4S1", "6304400381", "6300274608", "B00003CXQ6", "B00000I7Q3", "0788812181", "B000AY74OQ", "6305559295", "0792153677", "B00005LOUS", "0788809806", "078880720X", "B000009CTR", "1558906150", "B00001YX9H", "6301390725", "B00007AJLB", "B00000J2JA", "6304434340", "0783221800", "B00000ICHA", "1558907718", "6303148387", "B00004T2SJ", "6304155972", "6303939015", "0788810448", "6301404440", "630169774X", "B00003CXQ0", "6302968143", "B00006IUM9"], "also_viewed": ["6304089767", "6303314015", "B00005JKDQ", "B0000AQZYM", "0788805843", "6302787068", "0788812408", "6305326940", "155890641X", "0788805533", "0788802194", "6305940932", "6302320402", "078881172X", "6305229449", "6302526574", "6304500831", "B000035Z2S", "B00003CXQX", "6303983812", "6302642248", "6304100507", "6300274195", "6304290888", "0788812807", "0788806270", "6303036813", "6300274268", "6305319138", "B00005JL95", "6304501153", "6300275310", "B00004T2SI", "6303534422", "6305942285", "6302178924", "B00003CXXI", "6304401132", "6302961572", "B0007KTBIU", "6304400551", "6303929338", "6304089201", "B00004R99N", "6304978286", "B0000524CZ", "B00275EHJG", "B00005JKX3", "B00000I7Q3", "B00003CXHR", "6304089112", "6302426200", "B0000E32WB", "B00006CXK5", "B0030IIZ4M", "6305310068", "6304401736", "B00016JF2W", "B000063V8N"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 182756}, "asin": "6305949557", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515BCFM46JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Toy Story 2 [VHS]"}

The \"Making ofTitus\" documentary is one of the best of its kind, allowing an intimate glimpse of Taymor and her superb cast in rehearsal and production, molding Shakespeare's violent and oft-maligned play into a dazzling work of art.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004M9ZI0M", "B0059XTUR2", "B00443FMKM", "B001TR4G6W", "B0007WRT4Q", "B0059XTUT0", "B00DQN6IOK", "B000HWZ4AC", "0792844041", "B003Y5H5JM", "B008H6GHE2", "6305622876", "B00CDV4JNS", "B0038RSJ0U", "B00B6OEEKQ", "B004SIP83Y", "B00000JL7T", "B00005JLCI", "B000QGE8IS", "B00019072G", "B00B2BYY1W", "B000063JZQ", "B0000714BZ", "B00ECR7KX2", "B007CJL17S", "B00AZFECHW", "B0002TVWYW", "B00A7OBIGO", "B000BP86VE", "0671722921", "B0013D8LWC", "B003TRS8XM", "B001LPWGHS", "079284615X", "B004H0M31I", "B00B1E6EAY", "B007I1Q50S", "0780021312", "B00AMEZDPG", "B008D1A18E", "B007I1Q4YU", "B00006FXDE", "B0000AYJV8", "B000Q7ZNDG", "0769712231", "B00J379KKW", "B000PEKX62", "1478260998", "B007H7OQW2", "B004P29LDG", "B005COLEOA", "B0000APNTV", "B001RUALEC", "B0002235QM", "B00G4TWDJ2", "B00019JRFY", "B0002CHIVK", "014071491X", "B00F878JYE", "B0000542C5", "B000QGE8JC", "B00080ZGHO", "1558908331", "B00092ZAOK", "B007RP4BZ6", "B007LNBSU0", "B0038RSIGA", "B0012EM5CE", "B007JVSRKS", "B0051HCUMS", "B00005S872", "B00004Z4WW", "B000255LIY", "B000K7VHLY", "B007RP4CAA", "B000FUTVP0", "B000B8QF0U", "B000CR76U8", "B001G79Q60", "B00003WGNS", "B00B5DWF18", "B00007G1WH", "B0001ZMX9A", "B00027JYEY", "B004FGA2MG", "B009PM2BDS", "B0016MOWOG", "B00000F2L9", "B0030BOCMS", "B004SIP9U6", "B000777I88", "B00000FE2D", "B00AKOMIE2", "B00001U0DU", "B00AJER4EM", "B000059H9C", "B0050ODZ6M", "B00J379KHA", "B0052SO010", "B002SF9YUC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004M9ZI0M", "B0059XTUR2", "B00DQN6IOK", "B00443FMKM"]}, "price": 8.33, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 199118}, "asin": "6305962987", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AAR5W1Z8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Titus"}

{"description": "Pixar genius reigns in this funny romantic comedy, which stars a robot who says absolutely nothing for a full 25 minutes yet somehow completely transfixes and endears himself to the audience within the first few minutes of the film. As the last robot left on earth, Wall-E (voiced by Ben Burtt) is one small robot--with a big, big heart--who holds the future of earth and mankind squarely in the palm of his metal hand. He's outlasted all the \"Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class\" robots that were assigned some 700 years ago to clean up the environmental mess that man made of earth while man vacationed aboard the luxury spaceship Axiom. Wall-E has dutifully gone about his job compacting trash, the extreme solitude broken only by his pet cockroach, but he's developed some oddly human habits and ideas. When the Axiom sends its regularly scheduled robotic EVE probe (Elissa Knight) to earth, Wall-E is instantly smitten and proceeds to try to impress EVE with his collection of human memorabilia. EVE's directive compels her to bring Wall-E's newly collected plant sprout to the captain of the Axiom and Wall-E follows in hot pursuit. Suddenly, the human world is turned upside down and the Captain (Jeff Garlin) joins forces with Wall-E and a cast of other misfit robots to lead the now lethargic people back home to earth. Wall-E is a great family film with the most impressive aspect being the depth of emotion conveyed by a simple robot--a machine typically considered devoid of emotion, but made so absolutely touching by the magic of Pixar animation. Also well-worth admiring are the sweeping views from space, the creative yet disturbing vision of what strange luxuries a future space vacation might offer, and the innovative use of trash in a future cityscape. Underneath the slapstick comedy and touching love story is a poignant message about the folly of human greed and its potential effects on earth and the entire human race.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000VBJEEG", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00007LVCM", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B00AFEX83C", "0736424229", "B00005JN4W", "B00005JNQS", "B0042U94UQ", "B00E9ZATJO", "B001OMU6UM", "B00005JNS0", "B0030IIZ4M", "B0034JKZ86", "B002ZG97YM", "B002WJI2QQ", "B004HO6I4M", "B008YWY0HK", "B0012EM5D8", "B0006UEVT0", "B009SZCC9U", "B004G600A4", "B00AAXFYPI", "B00F522C7C", "B008Z1LBU4", "B00CTNYLQA", "B003H9M1Q2", "B000AAF1TU", "B008JFUQ16", "B000ROAK2W", "B000AY74OG", "B00275EHJG", "B00CWM58WY", "B00009M9BK", "B00EV1YZ96", "B001DPHDCY", "B000MV9026", "B001O5LVPI", "0783231474", "B00CQRN3QI", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00I6JOD2S", "B001HN6922", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B0087F7VSY", "B001U2MQE0", "B0030IIYYS", "B00A83075M", "B00H4Z07Q6", "B005LAIH4A", "B000DWMYQ8", "B00CHVJODE", "B0000AOX0O", "B003UESJF6", "B00JK531ES", "B00HLTD2OE", "B0001I561E", "B00BGYO7HG", "B003ZHVJGO", "B001ILFUD2", "B0002YLCOM", "B0039N74CW", "B00004U9WQ", "B00937R6QC", "B00CUDD0C0", "B004EPZ034", "B00004R99S", "B00003CXB4", "B000065V42", "B00005RDSQ", "B004ZBACOE", "B001GCUO7A", "B00AO686JC", "B000AAF1U4", "B0006JMLRK", "B00005JMQZ", "B0043X1FOK", "B00C7JGDBW", "B001JRB17Y", "B001KVZ6G6", "B00005TN8K", "B00005JMFH", "B00E9ZATKI", "B001ILFUDC", "B000V1Y44G", "B00003CX8Y", "B0011U52E2", "B00EBBGLFC", "B000YERP2S", "B00009YXAW", "B00003CXCQ", "B002NZK5SW", "B000G75AZC", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B0084IHVGG", "B00947N6D8", "B004LWZW7Y"], "bought_together": ["B001KVZ6FW", "B000VBJEEG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004HO6I4M", "B001KVZ6FW", "B00I6JOD2S", "B00005JN4W"]}, "price": 17.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 319062}, "asin": "7883706837", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51u-jDIxUZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wall-E (Mandarin Chinese Edition)"}

{"description": "Faced with not graduating unless he completes his science project, a  high school gear-head sneaks into a nearby Air Force base, looking for some gizmo he can pass off as his own invention.  What he finds is an alien energy device that rips holes in both time and space, infesting the school with everything from dinosaurs to the Viet Cong.  Writer-director Jonathan Betuel tries to mine some of the same veins asWeird ScienceandReal Genius(all three films were released in 1985) but with less success--mostly due to a slapdash script.  The film veers from beingThe Breakfast ClubtoWarGamestoRambo, leaping over plot holes all the way.

{"description": "From the title, you might expect a modern slasher picture or a serial  killer drama, but Mario Bava'sKill, Baby... Killis actually an eerie gothic ghost-story-with-a-body-count set in a quaint Italian turn-of-the-century village. When a city coroner arrives to examine the latest victim in a long string of \"suicides,\" he discovers a town of deserted streets, suspicious and terrified townspeople, and a conspiracy of silence. The town is haunted by the specter of a homicidal adolescent girl, a creepy vision in white whose little-girl giggles become chilling as she randomly chooses her victims and sends them to their gory deaths. Bava sets a moody stage of empty streets blanketed nightly in a swirling mist and flooded with lights of red, blue, and green--an expressionist night-cum-nightmare as unreal as it beautiful. This fanciful nocturnal world becomes the stage for virtual pageants of death in which the victims become tortured puppets of the malevolent spirit and are forced to murder themselves. The often arch and operatic performances are deadened by flat dubbing and an often prosaic translation, which creates an odd dissonance between the story and style. Though hardly to the tastes of modern slasher movie mavens, Bava's imaginative horror-thriller is full of grotesque and sometimes grueling murders, but trades the gore for an unsettling mood of doom.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B008BWFOXM", "B00FGAKEU0", "B000BB1926", "B00005R5GQ", "B00AGKH714", "B000MV8ZCW", "B008BWFOUU", "B00FGAKEEQ", "B001AR0D6I", "B001BSBBMQ", "B00CKWQNIO", "B000MV8ZDQ", "B00005B6KI", "1559409002", "B004KDYR20", "B000TZJCMS", "B00027JYMG", "B001BSBBGC", "B00005K3OF", "B0009X770O", "B0000A2ZSS", "B0002C9DK4", "B000PKG7CU", "B000LPS2R2", "B001PQT3AG", "B000TGJ89E", "B000MV8AB8", "B000068TPG", "B000FFJZO2", "B000V6LT6C", "B000TZJCNC", "B000KN9F6W", "6305340382", "B0009OL8LW", "B00005U12U", "B0000A0DVW", "B00EWJ402Y", "B00005NSXY", "B000WC3864", "B000HXDWNM", "B00JPUUSSU", "B000P0J0BU", "B0099VUWRM", "B000ION73U", "B000068TPD", "B008NNY8XQ", "B000B64TZK", "B00GBJWY76", "B00005Y6ZA", "B009CSVQRC", "6305907595", "6305071470", "B001SGEUDI", "B0002V7SRU", "B00L5KOXZM", "B000MGBSN0", "B000E41MTK", "B0002Y69VS", "B000E41MTA", "B002DU0RFS", "B0000640SM", "B00008975Y", "B005OK0YQG", "B000096I9U", "B00B2MLM34", "B000067J0H", "B00IARA8HU", "B000BFJM12", "0792846761", "B00005OCL3", "B000059H87", "B00331YO9Q", "B001HZUOT4", "B002G9U97C", "B00006IUIC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004Z1G1", "B000BB1926", "B000Q6UZUS", "B000MV8ABI"]}, "price": 14.93, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 425339}, "asin": "B00001ODHD", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZAZ2GYHFL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Kill Baby Kill"}

{"description": "This time around, the Brat Packers (Emilio Estevez, Christian Slater, Lou Diamond Phillips, Kiefer Sutherland) are on the run from the law and making a break for the border. Sutherland is yanked from his school-teaching job back East and extradited for trial, until he's liberated by the other members of the gang. There's a memorable scrap between Phillips and Slater, and a couple of pretty decent firefights, but all in all this is rather forgettable fare. It taps into the futility and camaraderie of classics likeThe Wild BunchandButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, but Sam Peckinpah or George Roy Hill it ain't. Jon Bon Jovi adds to the Rock-Stars-in-the-Old-West feel of this one, rife as it is with non-period dialogue and long, blowy hair. Still, fans of the original movie may find plenty to like in this sequel, even if it comes across as being a bit tired and turgid (notice there never was aYoung Guns III).--Jerry Renshaw", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008IHAW", "B000H5TVL2", "6304711905", "B000E5N6LG", "0783229631", "B000001FYL", "B0000TANUI", "B003ASLJRC", "0767817710", "B003AWRMCE", "B004AOECXI", "B005Z9MFWC", "B003ASLJS6", "B00027JZ3E", "B000XR9L50", "B000U1ZV3U", "B0036EH40Q", "B00006AUHQ", "6305428077", "B001LRJH0U", "B00002SSKG", "B00005QW6V", "B002GHHHP6", "B0018PH3L0", "B00AEBB9IM", "B001LMAK88", "0800177789", "6304806434", "B000FI8MPW", "B00008CMT4", "B0006IIPJO", "B00K2CHW48", "B00003CXMV", "B00008DDXA", "0783225725", "B0000AMJEK", "6304698801", "6304711891", "B0001FGBWU", "B006LL3W0W", "B000N3SSBW", "B000031WD9", "B000JBXHZK", "B00000G3PA", "B00DZUV0M4", "B000C20VPA", "B0002WZTOI", "B00005QT9P", "B000W1SZBS", "079284646X", "B003ASLJKE", "B00005OCJP", "B00ALTQRRK", "B002AS466O", "B000A50460", "B00AEBB9NM", "B00AEFY5B6", "B000JLPMPS", "B002O3Z4YI", "B00081U7HC", "1589793811", "B000056H2J", "B00AEFY4CG", "B0000DJZB9", "B009OE2O7A", "B0007OY2OO", "0792842502", "B002HGRI8W", "0792839056", "B002GHHHL0", "B00AEFYDM2", "B002JDWNSS", "B000BITVBA", "B007STBUHI", "B000ASATZ8", "6305504024", "B00006IUFV", "0783235070", "B000MX7V70", "B00008CMR4", "B00029RTCG", "B00004STDN", "B00AEFY4IA", "B004S699K4", "B00005JA8B", "B0009PVZ9Q", "B000059TGC", "B000NA1WDQ", "0749951044", "1926745043", "B0009X763M", "B00AEFXKUI", "B00005N5S5", "B0010DR4BO", "B004KDYQYY", "B000093I8L", "B005LL817W", "B00006RCOC", "B0068FZ0O2", "B00008O38I"], "bought_together": ["B00008IHAW", "6304711905"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00008IHAW", "B002U4UYZK", "6304711905", "B000056H2J"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 71228}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "Warner", "asin": "B0000399WE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51580X8TEAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Young Guns II"}

Except he's still shackled to his own chain-mates from the chain gang -- bad-tempered Pete (John Turturro, SUMMER OF SAM), and sweet, dimwitted Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson, HAMLET).

Populated with strange characters, including a blind prophet, sexy sirens, and a one-eyed Bible salesman (John Goodman, COYOTE UGLY), it's an odyssey filled with chases, close calls, near misses, and betrayal that will leave you laughing at every outrageous and surprising twist and turn.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004XQ83", "B00006LPGP", "B00005NVHA", "B00009W5CA", "B00029LNYQ", "B004U7MR3M", "B000A7DVR2", "B000P0J0EW", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000M7XRAG", "B003UESJME", "B00008RH3J", "B003102JDM", "B00008RH3L", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00007ELF1", "B00006CXGZ", "B0000YTP02", "B001JIE7JC", "B0041SI78O", "B002VECMAE", "B00GMV8L1Q", "B00000GQ3T", "B00A144O70", "6305212112", "B001B1UO7G", "B003AWRMCE", "0792843568", "B004SIP95G", "B002T9H2LA", "B001VC99HQ", "B000XR9L50", "B004SEUJO6", "B004AOECXI", "B002VWNICC", "6304711905", "B007L6VR12", "B007N31YH0", "B0000TANUI", "B0007PALZ2", "B000E8QVWY", "B0000033GO", "B0002V7ON8", "B00AEFXNLY", "B00AEFYMGO", "B001HN69AY", "B002VWNIAY", "B00AEBB9SM", "B0001GOH6Q", "B002VWNIBI", "B0009IOR5M", "B000RTB0R6", "0767818105", "B000GFRI4K", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B004SIP90G", "B0001Z4OXS", "B001KXZGO6", "B0001NBMTE", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B00AEBB8NS", "B00000G3PA", "B005LAIIJY", "B0002A2WDQ", "078322592X", "B0019L770A", "B00003CXC5", "B00H7KJRVY", "B00005JNBQ", "B00177YA1K", "B001DZOCY6", "B002VECM6S", "B0000JBALO", "B00EIBO8T6", "B00005PJ6O", "0767836359", "B000056VP4", "B0000CBY1C", "B00287Z18Y", "0783237367", "B00003CXIP", "B00AEFXJ86", "B00AEBB8NI", "B007STBUHI", "6305236569", "B00AEFXDO6", "0783230494", "B002NZK5TG", "0783229526", "B00553K8FY", "B00005JNY3", "B000A2UBN4", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00005V9HH", "B0000AC8LR", "B00AEBB9FA", "0767802519", "B00AEBB9F0", "B0012IWNZY"], "bought_together": ["B00004XQ83"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004XQ83", "B00G4DTSUK", "B00003CXC3", "B00006LPGP"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2194}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.19, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00003CXRM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5107M4P37AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "O Brother, Where Art Thou?"}

{"description": "To callPearl Harbora throwback to old-time war movies is something of an understatement. Director Michael Bay's epic take on the bombing that brought the United States into World War II hijacks every war movie situation and clich&#xE9; (some affectionate, some stale) you've ever seen and gives them a shiny, glossy spin until the whole movie practically gleams. Planes glisten, water sparkles, trees beckon--and Bay's re-creation of the bombing itself, a 30-minute sequence that's tightly choreographed and amazingly photographed, sets the action movie bar up quite a few notches. And in updating the classic war film, Bay and screenwriter Randall Wallace (Braveheart) use that old plot standby, the love triangle--this time, it's between two pilots (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) and a nurse (Kate Beckinsale) who find themselves stationed at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, during what they thought would be a nice, sunny tour of duty. Then, of course, history intervened.For the first 90 minutes of the movie, Affleck and Beckinsale find a nice, appealing chemistry that plays on his strengths as a movie star and hers as a serious actress--he gives her glamour, she gives him smarts. Their truncated romance--the beginning of which is told in flashback so we can get right to the point where he has to leave her to go to England--works, thanks to their charm. They're no Kate and Leo fromTitanic(a strategy the film strives hard toward), but they're pretty darn adorable in their own right. Hartnett, as the not entirely unwelcome third wheel, squints bravely but makes only a slight dent in the film. Everyone else inPearl Harbor--from Cuba Gooding Jr.'s brave navy seaman to Jon Voight's able impersonation of FDR--is pretty much a glorified walk-on, taking a backseat to the pyrotechnics and action sequences that keep the three-hour film in fairly constant motion. But when that action does take hold,Pearl Harboris quite a thrilling ride.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792151712", "B000059HGY", "B00000K3AN", "B00AEBBA36", "0792133153", "079212569X", "6305169187", "6301734734", "0792147618", "0792116887", "6304618344", "079213690X", "6303269834", "6304925131", "6305718792", "6304259131", "B00004WIDB", "6304935811", "6303057225", "6304143184", "6302250269"], "bought_together": ["B00000K3AN", "B00AEBBA36"], "also_viewed": ["B00000G3PA", "0792151712", "6300213668", "B00000JS61", "6303215734", "6303402348", "B00004WIDB", "079213690X", "6305750750", "B004751DFU", "B00005O893", "B00000K3AN", "6301792734", "B00E5I2MCM", "6305169187", "B00007LVCM", "B007SPPANM", "B00L4K3MLE", "B00FLML7HW", "B008QZ5PY2", "B00JBGWP3Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 234413}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.49, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXTF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HC1ZDJN6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]"}
{"description": "If you want to laugh and enjoy yourself, I recommend Bring It On. With a superb cast, catchy lines, and a fully developed plot, this movie is great! Kirsten Dunst stars as Torrance Shipman, the ditzy but loveable high school senior who is newly elected team captain of her high school cheerleading team. But when a replacement cheerleader, Missy Pantone, walks in to the Toros' cheerleading squad (hilariously portrayed by Eliza Dushku), she shows Torrance that the team's cheers are ripped off from the East Compton Clovers, and you can believe that the Clovers are fed up with the stealing. Torrance, horrified that her cheerleading career has been a fake, makes an effort to be original, but the result is a humiliating performance at a competition. Torrance is comforted by love interest Cliff Pantone (played by hottie Jesse Bradford), Missy's REALLY cute twin brother, and a romance begins. As the movie leads up to the UCA Nationals competition, the Clovers and Toros fight for the win. Who will it be? Well you better watch it for yourself. Bring It On is a refreshing change from the immature sick sex movies and it instead is fresh, bright, witty, and very funny. I recommend Bring It On to anyone.", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B000WC39KE", "6304434340", "B003QZSWU6"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 424035}, "asin": "B00003CXMO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VN6MTN3AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bring It on [VHS]"}

{"description": "Fans of Julie Andrews will delight in this 1995 videotaping of the stage musicalVictor/Victoria, based on the 1982 movie of the same name. The plot has been kept intact: an out-of-work British soprano (Julie Andrews) in Paris falls in with a down-on-his-luck gay man (Tony Roberts), who gets the idea to present Victoria as the world's greatest female impersonator, Victor. The plan is a phenomenal success until a Chicago mobster on vacation (Michael Nouri) sees Victor in a nightclub and falls in love--and refuses to believe that Victor is a man. Due to the needs of the stage, the musical doesn't have the snap, crackle, and propulsive drive of the movie, which is a sprightly romp; to make up for this, the story has been expanded (some might say padded) with extensive dance numbers andnew songsby Henry  Mancini and Leslie Bricusse, with additional musical material by Frank Wildhorn. While Roberts and Nouri don't quite have the charisma of Robert Preston and James Garner, who played their roles in the movie, they're seasoned stage performers and make the most of things--Nouri in particular has a strong singing voice, which may surprise people who only know him from his movie career. And Julie Andrews is Julie Andrews; at this point in her career, you either love her or you don't.Victor/Victoriaisn't going to change anyone's mind, but Andrews knows her audience and knows how to give them what they want.--Bret Fetzer", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 657038}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.8, "brand": "", "asin": "B00004RERP", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EXYZ91E5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Victor/Victoria (1995 Broadway Production) [VHS]"}

Molly is his voluptuous, delightfully earthy wife whose infidelity is a major burden Bloom must bear.

{"description": "On an international flight, journalist Buck Williams (Kirk Cameron from GROWING PAINS) and pilot Rayford Steele (Brad Johnson, the formor Marlboro Man) discover that several passengers have simply vanished. Soon, it becomes clear that millions of people have disappeared off the face of the Earth, and they take it upon themselves to uncover the root of this perturbing mystery.LEFT BEHIND: THE MOVIE, based on the the successful series of Christian novels written by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, could be one in a long tradition of extravagant classic Hollywood biblical epics. It steadily and deliberately delivers the same themes shared by older Christian pictures, but it benefits from more modern visual trappings. LEFT BEHIND might also be compared to another group of films made in the 1990s that are oriented towards fundamentalist Christians.

{"description": "This thoroughly second-rate follow-up to the groundbreaking (and highly profitable) horror flickThe Blair Witch Project--produced byBlair Witchdirectors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez--plays with the notions of reality and fantasy that surrounded the hype of the original movie, and attempts to throw in some scares along the way. A year after the release of the original film, a group of five Blair Witch aficionados--four out-of-towners led by one seriously unhinged \"tour guide\"--venture into the woods outside Burkittsville, Maryland, on a tour of the sites made famous by missing documentarians Heather, Mike, and Josh. After a drunken night of camping out in hopes of communing with the spirit of the Blair Witch, the five wake up to find that their seemingly innocent sleep may have been disturbed somehow. But what exactly happened? If you're expecting suspense of the first degree and a horrifying payoff similar to the one that climaxed the first film, you'll be sorely disappointed. After retreating to an old, run-down broom factory (get it? Broom factory? Blair Witch? Oh well...), the five go over their videotapes of the night in question to get some answers, and basically wind up screaming at each other for the remainder of the film, and shedding some blood along the way. Documentary filmmaker Joe Berlinger (of the highly acclaimedParadise LostandBrother's Keeper) proves that he should definitely stick to nonfiction filmmaking, and the entire cast is grating and unpleasant, aside from a scene-stealing turn by Kim Director as a goth chick with attitude to burn and a no-nonsense approach to this Blair Witch stuff. Strictly for hard-coreBlair Witchfans only, and even then this sequel may prove to disappoint.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00001QGUM", "B00LLAV26O", "B00LMBUR6S", "B002AS45VK", "B00LBFFR2Y", "B0009X763M", "B003Y5H59M", "B00L6AW1K0", "B00AEFYYH6", "B00L9K2EGS", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B000I2J68M", "B00KTFJ5F2", "B00HRCATDW", "B003VE9WP6", "B000A6T1ZY", "B00L3OAS5Y", "B001NPD9LS", "B000099T3M", "B00IQHPS6A", "B001UGGVDI", "B00KUS5YGC", "B002LMSWN2", "B00AEFY31S", "B000MEYJHO", "B00IKM5LFY", "B0006SGYL0", "B00KTFJ50M", "B00006FDBT", "B003L20IEW", "B00006FI0R", "B000FS9FE4", "6305622760", "B000KJU1KK", "B0051GLDQS", "B0000CEB6Y", "B003VA3JUO", "B00HRCBGRA", "B0000AOX09", "B008874968", "B000BTIU4S", "B002VKE1K2", "B00AEFY37C", "B00L22H2IS", "B000BTJDGC", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00005N5RM", "B001B8XRT6", "B00004W4UD", "B002YI9304", "B009AMALGM", "B00GJ7CUFG", "B00AEFYV9W", "B004W48KHK", "B00GNAO70K", "B00000I1KK", "B00K2CHVSK", "B00J81S92S", "B0021L8UFI", "B001P3SA9Y", "B004P7CM9Q", "B00009MGEM", "B005CFBZQ6", "B0056P6SOG", "B00JF5GAIW", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00CERJI5U", "B003Q6D25K", "B00B96TGQS", "B000S0GYRU", "B00BM4Q4H6", "B00005LQ0Z", "B00005JOWW", "B009DA743Y", "B005B0QYMM", "B000A2X3U2", "B00003CWRF", "B000AM6OQ2", "B00AEFY2WI", "B0031U8OEK", "B001MVYUR0", "B000V4UFZK", "B0002C4JJ4", "B000GCFO0I", "B00HRUQ7WG", "B00IXD2MWK", "B0000VCZNE", "B009O07N9I", "B0002KQNL8", "B00AGKH4MG", "B001CT876C", "B001KKU9CI", "B00AEFY2LO", "B00I31COHA", "B000FSME9W", "B000WC3864", "B006P0FD4W", "B000A5045Q", "B008JFUNYG"], "bought_together": ["B00001QGUM", "B00AEFYYH6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00001QGUM", "B000FA57UI", "B00AEFYYH6", "B00BEIYMAG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 91036}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.99, "brand": "", "asin": "B000056T5E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51674ASQWCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Book of Shadows - Blair Witch 2 (DVD + CD)"}

{"description": "Laurence Olivier broke with the theatrical poise of previous  roles to play seedy music-hall entertainer Archie Rice in John  Osborne's acclaimed play,The Entertainer, reprising the role in  Tony Richardson's 1960 screen version and earning an Oscar nomination  for his performance. Olivier gives his all as the gap-toothed  vaudevillian living in the shadow of his music-hall-legend father Billy  Rice (Roger Livesey), spitting out pithy wisecracks and mugging  pathetically for bored audiences in seaside dives. Under the  life-of-the-party patter, however, is a pathetic music-hall dinosaur trying too  hard for his moment in the spotlight, nursing his wounded humiliation  in trysts with na&iuml;ve young girls and pouring out his passion in  his finale tune, \"Why Should I Care.\" \"I have an affinity with Archie  Rice,\" Olivier once opined. \"It's what I really am. I'm not like  Hamlet.\"Shot on location on the boardwalk carnivals and holiday camps of the  British seaside, the shabby show-biz world is beautifully photographed  but never quite shakes off its origins on the stage. It's the vivid  performances that drive the drama: Joan Plowright (who married Olivier  in 1961) as his pragmatic daughter; Alan Bates and Albert Finney  (making their film debuts) as his sons, a next-generation show-biz  hustler and a soldier shipped off to the Suez, respectively; and Brenda  de Banzie as Archie's long-suffering wife. \"You've been a good  audience.

{"description": "The key component of this Vista Series DVD is a six-part documentary about the making of the film from idea to theatrical release. M. Night Shyamalan talks at length about the film and his filmmaking technique in this exclusive one-hour feature. The approach is straightforward but at times is as self-congratulatory as a marketing puff piece. Because Shyamalan works so leanly, the five deleted scenes are excellent, including a chilling scene from the film's final act. Also included are storyboard comparisons and another glimpse of one of Shyamalan's early home movies.Signsis the first of the Vista Series to be a single disc and the extras seem light, but there are only a couple of quibbles: the director again does not provide a commentary track and there is no DTS soundtrack.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00004BZIY", "B00064LJVE", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00003CXQA", "B000JLTR8Q", "B004SIP92O", "B00AEFYYH6", "B003102JDC", "B00005JNTI", "B00000G3PA", "B002GHHHKQ", "B003Y5H4SO", "B0002DB54A", "B00008G8M4", "B00AEBBA2W", "B0000648X0", "630471193X", "B002O3Z50G", "B00011CZRE", "B000PHVZNE", "B0087ZG7HK", "B002NZK5SM", "B00004XPPG", "B00005JOC9", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B0021L8UXA", "0783225733", "B0006L0LOS", "B0006SGYL0", "B000NOKFHQ", "B005LAIHXQ", "0800177029", "6305767866", "B00004TS0G", "6304711891", "B00AEFY3MC", "B002GIBVVG", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000U1ZV8K", "B00005JNY3", "B00070FX5U", "B00AEBB8NI", "B0002KVUKM", "B00008G8LY", "B000F6IOAM", "B00005JN0T", "B00AEBBA36", "B002LMV7R0", "B002NZK5UU", "B0013FDM7E", "B002O3Z4WK", "B0068FZ0GK", "B00015YVDG", "B000LC55F2", "B00001ZWUS", "B002GHHHL0", "B000BTJDGC", "B000EHRVOW", "B0087ZG7J8", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00005JN2Z", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEFXSLE", "B00019073K", "B00005LC4D", "B00005JL78", "B00IBKXSKA", "B004EPYZPS", "B00000JDIQ", "B00AEBB9WI", "B000RIWAVW", "0780618548", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00005JN0W", "B00AEFXNLY", "6305428115", "0767811100", "0800141601", "B00AEFXT1S", "0780631536", "B00000IQC4", "B004P7CNUY", "B001GCUO02", "B002AS464Q", "B00003CWS3", "B00006FDCD", "B000FS9FCG", "B00005JKZH", "B000067FP8", "B000K7VHQE", "B00BEIYG98", "B00005JNNT", "B000068NNU", "B000XT1P4S", "B0087ZG7PW", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B002I9Z8BM", "B00AEFXKUI", "B0010X73ZG", "B00003CXIP"], "bought_together": ["B00004BZIY", "B004SIP92O"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004BZIY", "B00386EZUY", "B000QUU4M8", "B0000VCZK2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 11300}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.99, "brand": "Touchstone Video", "asin": "B00005JL3T", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51c02AOAyCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Signs"}

{"description": "With its disturbing images and a few good shocks,The Ringis the kind of frightfest you'll watch to set a chilling mood or spook your susceptible friends, but when you try to sort it out, this well-mounted American remake (of the 1998 Japanese hitRingu, based on Koji Suzuki's popular novel) becomes a batch of incoherent parts. The negligible plot follows a Seattle reporter (Naomi Watts) as she investigates the death of her niece, the victim of a mysterious videotape that, according to urban legend, causes the viewer's death seven days later. (Fear Dot Comborrowed the same idea while avoiding this film's lofty pretensions.) The countdown structure follows the reporter, her son, and her estranged boyfriend into deepening layers of terror--all quite effective until the movie attempts to explain itself. At that you're better off shutting down your brain and letting the creepy visuals take over.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009X763M", "B0006SGYL0", "B004SIP92O", "B00001QGUM", "B00151QYOO", "B001P3SA9Y", "B009XTF8KQ", "B004LWZW24", "B00004BZIY", "B0021L8UFI", "B001JNNDJM", "B000V4UFZK", "B000PMLJMQ", "B0021L8UPS", "B000TJ6PBK", "B0019X3YX2", "B00005RHGK", "B00BEIYMAG", "B0026LQM2Q", "B00005JNJR", "B003UGLCIA", "B000IHY9TS", "B002VWNIDG", "B00AIBZLVY", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00006FDCD", "B008JFUNYG", "B00EZ50SGW", "B00B96TGQS", "B00005JL3T", "B000BTJDGC", "B00AJLHUA8", "B000OVLBGM", "B000RIWAVW", "B003VA3JUO", "B00DW5IM14", "B00005JNY3", "B0021L8UXA", "B00008LUNW", "B000F6IOAM", "B001D2WU9I", "B002JT69IW", "B000AA4JL6", "B00174RCHW", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B00386EZUY", "B0000VCZMK", "B00018D42W", "B0000E2R6P", "B0006SSOHC", "B001U0HBQA", "B00004TS0G", "B003L20IEW", "B008F283VS", "B001DJLD1W", "B0053TWVDC", "B00007G1ZB", "B0015ET3YO", "B00011CZRE", "B004LWZW2O", "B002ZG971U", "B000088NQR", "B002LMSWN2", "B00AEFXSLE", "B0000648X0", "B00005JOWW", "B00005JNNT", "B0031U8OEK", "B006CXIKYC", "B001MVYUR0", "B004SIP9P6", "B003UN0752", "B001NPD9LS", "B008WAM2E2", "B001B1UO6W", "B000GBEWRU", "B00AZTUUQK", "B0002DB54A", "B004SIP9O2", "0780631684", "B003LR5BD0", "B000GCFO0I", "B000VKL6Z2", "B005CFBYW6", "B008G33PIM", "B000GSYRY6", "B0010X73ZG", "B000AM4P9K", "B000A5045Q", "B000056T5E", "B005TK23PQ", "B004BLJQOK", "0783116926", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00BEIYG98", "B005LAIGOQ", "B0097C046W", "B0013FDM7E", "B00BEIYGT8", "B0001FR3IQ"], "bought_together": ["B0009X763M", "B0006SGYL0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004LWZW24", "B000V4UFZK", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00005JNY3"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 99771}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.79, "brand": "Dreamworks Skg", "asin": "B00005JLTK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MKWPKHSTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Ring (Widescreen Edition)"}

In other words, the ultimate catch has just met his match!", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002WEEYIQ", "6305499144", "B006YTGL4K", "B000N4SHOE", "B0079K4WEE", "B001TKUXVQ", "B00005JNDZ", "B000077VR3", "B00005JPE3", "B0002JZT5A", "B00K2CHWYI", "B00003CY5G", "B0000996F6", "B00006ZXSO", "B001WAKOW6", "B004SEUJK0", "B0018M6J90", "B004A8ZWV0", "B001RTKKS0", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00BLN4UPG", "B005LAIGXW", "B004SEUJBE", "B002ZG9800", "B000E6ESL2", "B0013D8LC2", "B00003CXHG", "B00008G7UF", "B002ZG988M", "B00006ZXSL", "B00005JN3W", "B00AEFYCW8", "B001LPWGH8", "B006GL8NGU", "B004GJYRA0", "B004L3AR0K", "B00I6JODGO", "B0067EKY7M", "B002VECMAE", "B00AEBB8NS", "B00EIBO8T6", "B00003CXSM", "6304765266", "B000E6EHE0", "B002TQKL7K", "B000ASDFGI", "B00005JLQH", "B00003CY0V", "B0006FO8E8", "B0045HCJRG", "B00005JLYW", "B0011N1WE8", "B002OVED88", "B00023P4RO", "B0001GOH6Q", "B002P413IC", "B000N4SHOO", "B004SIP7AS", "B00D3LA6SY", "B002ZG989G", "B000W089XS", "B009INAC12", "B0013ERFGE", "B000U1ZV8A", "B000OCZA04", "B0007QS2ZC", "B00003CXWM", "B00447L4KA", "B00006FMUW", "B004IK30PA", "B000059PQB", "B004ZG5F28", "B0037E8HOC", "B000XJD33O", "B00006ZXSN", "B004SIP9I8", "B005Z9MFRC", "B000MGB6M8", "B00009QUH4", "B002ZG98FU", "B001CC7PLM", "B00AKGG6JS", "B002ZG97QK", "B000VE4UHO", "B00GTO6WXU", "B001675YQ6", "B000EHRVOW", "B004EPZ0BG", "B00AEBB8YW", "0767819772", "B004YCKKFK", "B000M06KJ8", "B0036TGSIK", "B00005MEVO", "B0007P0X9G", "B008220BA2", "B000MQC9H4", "B002ZG9968", "B003UYUQZW"], "bought_together": ["B002WEEYIQ", "B000N4SHOE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000N4SHOE", "6305499144", "B006YTGL4K", "B000MQC9H4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17510}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.49, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00005JLZW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BW9TPJDML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Down with Love (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "There's only one deleted scene in this two-disc DVD set, but it's a doozy. The \"Sgt. Candy Scene\" is a must-see and, unfortunately, the best thing on the second disc. The rushed HBO documentary shows us far more flash than substance. Better is the Visual Effects Lab that goes more in-depth with four sequences, although you need to wade through a hokey interface for each segment. Making your \"own\" effects isn't that much fun; you can only choose a few effects that change in two scenes. Anyone looking to get the complicated backstory of the trilogy figured out should dig into the \"Sky Net Database\" and an intricate timeline. The two commentary tracks are worth a listen, with director Jonathan Mostow's solo track the better one. The director goes into great detail on how the little things (from lighting street scenes to tricks for destroying buildings) count.  The second track is pieced together from the actors recorded separately. Mostow appears with actress Claire Danes (doing her first commentary track) and their chemistry is enjoyable after a slow start. The other actors have less interesting things to say, including Schwarzenegger who is constantly--yet enthusiastically--selling the film.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5", "B001FB55HQ", "B00005JA8B", "B00070FX5U", "B00007AJG4", "B002ZG98LO", "B000T9OP7G", "B002GHHHME", "B00005JKIP", "B002QFYJFY", "B0002J58HO", "B0000AXE8I", "B001AQO43M", "B00AKGG828", "B00026ZG10", "B0001BKAEY", "B00IZZDWKM", "B001451HXO", "B0000VCZK2", "B000056PMU", "B000BPL2FQ", "B000RW3VCK", "B0004Z33F0", "B000U1ZV8K", "B0045HCJGC", "B0004Z33EQ", "B00005JNTU", "B000HRMAPE", "B00008G8M4", "B000RRS7RE", "B00005JKYX", "B0000VD12I", "B000FC2FQA", "B00000ILDG", "B00000G3PA", "B00005JMZK", "B000MGBSE4", "B0087ZG7J8", "B0004Z33EG", "B000P0J0AQ", "B00005JMEW", "B0087ZG7NO", "B00003CXTA", "B0002CHK1S", "B000RJO56E", "B00177YA1K", "B00004STDN", "B005COLETU", "B001AK3S4Y", "B000VNMMR0", "B0000959N0", "B00005JMUA", "1558908846", "6305767866", "B001RIY4WE", "B0049IHX2C", "B000VI70QS", "B000EGDB10", "B002GSXKN8", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B0045HCJ9O", "B003QO8TOQ", "B00005JNJV", "B001451HX4", "B00I9TDMRM", "B0006GANOQ", "B00003CXSP", "6305428115", "B00016MSV2", "B00005JOC9", "B000TJBN80", "B009MO57H6", "B000O77SQS", "B0087ZG7HK", "B001OST0M6", "B005LAIHXQ", "B0002J4X1Q", "B0002V7OI8", "B0015XHP2C", "6304806434", "B000QXDED6", "B00005JL3K", "B008JFUPFI", "B003PIUINS", "0783225946", "0792839056", "B00005N7Z1", "B0006GAO6I", "B001DZOC6Y", "B00005JL78", "B001HN697M", "B00IJS2OXG", "B002NXSRVG", "B00008G8M5", "B00005JN0T", "B003XURDAY", "B000O77SRM", "B006VRRGNK", "B00F4FFO8E"], "bought_together": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001VLBDD0", "B00005N5S5", "B001FB55HQ", "B002JT6AO0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 115564}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 13.47, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JM0B", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5143TFPX8SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Even though it's only a single disc, the28 Days LaterDVD includes a lot of very interesting features, including the alternate ending that was shown after the end of the film a couple months into its theatrical run.  It's much bleaker, as director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland say in their optional commentary.  Another alternate ending is almost the same as the theatrical ending but slightly less happy.  Most interesting is the \"radical\" alternate ending that takes an entirely different path midway through the film.  It wasn't filmed, however, so Boyle and Garland narrate the action over storyboards, and it's a surprisingly engrossing 11 minutes.  Boyle and Garland also did a commentary track for the film, and they talk about how they were able to get the shots of deserted London and why they used the ending they did.  There are also six very watchable deleted scenes, and Boyle and Garland's comments range from \"great sequence\" to \"a disgrace.\" Slightly less relevant is a 24-minute documentary that spends its first 10 minutes on the real-life threat of infectious diseases before recapping the film and discussing such elements as the use of digital video and the boot camp the actors had to attend. If you need any further proof that the DVD was a labor of love, even the stills galleries have commentaries.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000TJBN80", "B0002ABURA", "B0006A9FKA", "B002WY65VU", "B00111YM5Q", "B0013D8LAE", "B000IHY9TS", "B000Y7U98C", "B00005JO16", "B0021L8UXA", "B0001611DI", "B0013D8LA4", "B000RJO56O", "B002JT69IW", "B001D2WU9I", "B002VWNIDG", "B0002CHK1S", "B00D7AM6M0", "B003UGLCIA", "B00AEFYYH6", "B001MVYUR0", "B000UAE7O0", "B003EYVXYG", "B000EHRVP6", "B0028DRGDQ", "B0021L8UPS", "B001NPD9LS", "B005LAIIMG", "B000FAOC2W", "B000LP6KNU", "B0006SSOHC", "B000WC3864", "B0013FDM7E", "B00000K3TO", "B000RIWAVW", "B000GCFO0I", "B000O76ZQC", "B004LWZW24", "B000RJO578", "B002VKB0KG", "B006ISJR7U", "B00004TS0G", "B004SIP9MY", "B002VKE1K2", "B00G5GNYY2", "B000N6TX1I", "B0024FADD8", "B005QUQRBU", "B001MYIXAC", "B00D3DJIG8", "B001GUYB08", "B000TGJ80S", "B000V4UFZK", "B004SIP92O", "B00009MGEM", "B0010X73ZG", "B00005K3NR", "B002LMSWN2", "B000063RQQ", "B00000ILDD", "B004BZ5AN2", "0767802519", "B00001QGUM", "B00AJLHUA8", "B002SJIO4A", "B00005JMUA", "B00J5LXT6M", "B005J9ZFQG", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B000AXWHSA", "B00BEIYMAG", "B00005JLWN", "B004BLJQOK", "B0015ET3YO", "B008220BLG", "B000031WD9", "B000069HZP", "B000EQ5SRK", "B0007Y08QA", "B000PMLJMQ", "B000BUNZY2", "B002ZG98UA", "B000V4UH08", "B001JNNDJM", "B003HKN52U", "B003UAKEBW", "B0007DFJ0G", "B0019X3YX2", "B00CE00ZV8", "B00003CXCF", "B0009WFEDC", "B000FS9FE4", "B00005JNJV", "B00011CZRE", "B002T9H2LA", "B000RW5BZ0", "B00005JMXX", "B000WC389G", "B007STBUHI", "B002ZG983M"], "bought_together": ["B000TJBN80", "B002WY65VU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008SAPC20", "B003J42JLC", "B000Y7U98C", "B0002ABURA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 37382}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.25, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00005JMA8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511KHM89SFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "28 Days Later (Widescreen Special Edition)"}

{"description": "Like any DVD blockbuster from producer Jerry Bruckheimer, the extras are plentiful and often a bit too self-congratulatory (worst offender here is the primary commentary track). The slickly (natch) produced making-of documentary goes through the standard routine; however, the less-flashy \"fly on the wall\" bits--just showing what happens on set without comment--is more fun, offering effortless insight on the filmmaking process. The best treasure is a nifty interactive history on pirates with plenty of background material. You can simply play the filmed segments or take a tour around a ship to discover the material (and a few surprises). There's a lot of archival material on the theme-park ride that inspired the film and several odds and ends including an enjoyable chronicle of the vintage ship's voyage from its home harbor to the movie set. The kids should really dig the DVD-ROM \"Moonlight Becomes Ye,\" in which they can turn their own mug into a ghostly pirate. There's also a bounty of extended and deleted scenes (19 in all) and a very funny blooper reel. With both DTS and Dolby 5.1, sound systems will get a workout with the excellent (and loud) sound design.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000I0RQVI", "B000U7WV1Y", "B005COPWZW", "B004A8ZWUQ", "B00005JN5E", "B0013BM63O", "B006VRRGNK", "B00005JKZV", "B00005JPH2", "B0014Z4OMU", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00003CWT6", "B004DTLK80", "B00005JKZY", "B0000A1RJI", "B004M1A21K", "B004DTLK7G", "B00003CXZ1", "B001HN694K", "B001E75QH0", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00005JKCH", "B0087ZG7HK", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B000E6EK2Y", "B000E8M0VA", "B003UYUQZW", "B00AEFYGBA", "B000W746GK", "B00005JMQW", "B0083SBMBM", "B001DHXT20", "B0002234LS", "B000W7F5SS", "B002PMV9FG", "B0002KVUKM", "B004EPYZUS", "B0053FANRC", "B00BEZTMFY", "6304806434", "B000VR0570", "0783231644", "B001OQCV6A", "B000AYELVA", "B008JFUO72", "B005G4TJUC", "B00004R99S", "B00023B1LC", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00003CXI1", "B001HQZJMU", "B00000IRE6", "B0002ZDVEU", "B008QE9XD2", "B00F84H73Q", "B00E5I2MEK", "B003Y5H5EW", "B007K3JFUQ", "B003QO8TOQ", "B000NQRR1Q", "B000YPUF9W", "B001EZE5BU", "B004A8ZWSS", "B0009MDPYM", "B00LG6YEKE", "B002ZG980U", "B002ZG994U", "B000U1ZV8K", "B001DZ8TRW", "B00005JLR2", "B000VWYJ86", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00000JQB5", "B004XKCZAG", "B000W796OM", "B001GCUO0W", "B00AQSN7HE", "B00000ILDH", "B0053FANT0", "B0000VAFO0", "B0002IQMAM", "B000HRMAPE", "B004LWZW7Y", "B008UZA8FY", "B0001HLVS2", "B00007AJGH", "B00005JNJV", "B003YAR97K", "B00CHVJODE", "B000UR9T8C", "B0049IHX2C", "B000G6BLW4", "B00177YA1K", "0783227345", "B0014Z4ON4", "B001TK80C0", "B002O5M4T4", "B00AEBBA72", "B00005JOC9"], "bought_together": ["B000I0RQVI", "B000U7WV1Y"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005COPWZW", "B000I0RQVI", "B0071JADFU", "B00005JPFX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6260}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.23, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JM5E", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51fX40gGdXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}

{"description": "Marvel Comics' first family of superherodom, the Fantastic Four, hits the big screen in a light-hearted and funny adventure.  It begins when down-on-his-luck genius Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd,Horatio Hornblower) has to enlist the financial and intellectual help from former schoolmate and rival Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon,Nip/Tuck) in order to pursue outer-space research into human DNA.  Also on the trip are Reed's best friend, Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis,The Shield); his former lover, Sue Storm (Jessica Alba,Dark Angel,Sin City), who's now Doom's employee and love interest; and her hotshot-pilot brother, Johnny Storm (Chris Evans,Cellular).  Things don't go as planned, of course, and the quartet becomes blessed--or is it cursed?--with superhuman powers: flexibility, brute strength, invisibility and projecting force fields, and bursting into flame.  Meanwhile, Doom himself is undergoing a transformation.Among the many entries in the comic-book-movie frenzy,Fantastic Fouris refreshing because it doesn't take itself too seriously. Characterization isn't too deep, and the action is a bit sparse until the final reel (like most \"first\" superhero movies, it has to go through the \"how did we get these powers and what we will do with them\" churn). But it's a good-looking cast, and original comic-book cocreator Stan Lee makes his most significant Marvel-movie cameo yet, in a speaking role as the FF's steadfast postal carrier, Willie Lumpkin. Newcomers to superhero movies might find the idea of a family with flexibility, strength, invisibility, and force fields a retread ofThe Incredibles, but Pixar's animated film was very much a tribute to the FF and other heroes of the last 40 years. The irony is that whileFantastic Fouris an enjoyable B-grade movie, it's the tribute,The Incredibles, that turned out to be a film for the ages.--David HoriuchiOn the DVDThe principal extra on the DVD is a spirited commentary track by Jessica Alba, Michael Chiklis, and Ioan Gruffud.  Self-avowed FF fan Chiklis explains why the Thing doesn't have a craggy brow, Alba recalls which things were \"cool,\" and they talk about looking forward to the sequel. There are three short deleted scenes (including a goofy Wolverine reference), 20 minutes of barely watchable hand-held video footage from the press tour, music videos, and some short featurettes including an appearance by FF creator Stan Lee.--David HoriuchiThe Fantastic Four at Amazon.comComics and Graphic NovelsDisney animated seriesThe classic comic bookMovie tie-in graphic novelThe Xbox gameFantastic FourSoundtrackThe Fantastic CastJessica Albaas Sue StormMichael Chiklisas The ThingIoan Gruffuddas Reed RichardsChris Evansas Johnny StormStills fromFantastic Four(click for larger images)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000VI70QS", "B0000959N0", "B001DHXT20", "B0007P0Y7C", "B004EPZ07K", "B001CDR1FG", "B00E5I2MEK", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00E5I2M9K", "B00E5I2MCM", "B000OVLBF8", "B00005JMQW", "B008JFUO72", "B004LWZW42", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000UR9T8C", "B0090SI56Y", "B000HEVZ9E", "B000HCO83Q", "B00005JKCH", "B005OY6LBE", "B001OQCVI8", "B008JFUS0U", "B004LWZWFQ", "B000AYELVU", "B0002IQMAM", "B003YAR97K", "B0083SBMBM", "B001QB9H1U", "B001AK3S4Y", "B005LAIGW8", "B000AYELVA", "B001F7MSFM", "B0006L0LOS", "B003H8F3AY", "B008JFUPFI", "B006DHAT5K", "B002GSXKN8", "B002ZG99G8", "B00005JNJV", "B002IPFWTE", "B002NXSRVG", "B000VR0570", "B0006D3HGA", "B004LWZWGA", "B005LAII44", "B000YV1Q2G", "B00F4FFO8E", "B005G4TJUC", "B00005JN0T", "B0007US7CQ", "B00E1HIXEI", "B000J10EQU", "B0002KVUKM", "B000VKL6T8", "B001TK80C0", "B002ZG99B8", "B000Y7U98C", "B002GSXKNI", "B00005JM5B", "B001GZ6QC4", "B000PFUAP0", "B00005JKWJ", "B0009P42WI", "B00174RCHW", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00005JKYX", "B005TK0MFE", "B000VNMMPW", "B001QTXM5Y", "B000EU1Q7M", "B00008G8M4", "B000P6XQ50", "B00005JN5E", "B0007V6ITE", "B001VLBDD0", "B005LAIH54", "B001FB55HQ", "B000IJ79WU", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B00561BNJK", "B001VLFE7G", "B000CNER1S", "B00K7IPFSM", "B001BP4K22", "B00005JL78", "B0001CNRS4", "B00979KQD6", "B00157OI9Q", "B004EPYZUS", "B002HWRYJE", "B009YQJ322", "B003Y5H5EW", "0780624890", "B001RHGRT8", "B0013J55B6", "B0013BM63O", "B0053FANPY", "B009MO57H6", "078401132X"], "bought_together": ["B000VI70QS", "B001DHXT20"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000VI28Z6", "B000VI70QS", "B008JFUS0U", "B0090SI56Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12162}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.98, "brand": "Twentieth Century Fox", "asin": "B00005JNTU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AM4R5J04L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fantastic Four (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "The delightful designs of William Joyce (writer/illustrator of such popular children's books asGeorge ShrinksandBently & Egg) makeRobotsa joy to behold. The round, bouncy, and ramshackle forms of hero Rodney Copperbottom and his computer-animated friends are part of an ornate and daffyFender providing assistance.Rube-Goldberg universe of elaborate contraptions and gleaming metallic surfaces.  Rodney (voiced with a hint-of-Scottish lilt by Ewan McGregor) is a young inventor who sets off for Robot City to work for Big Weld (Mel Brooks), the supreme inventor of the mechanical world.  But upon his arrival, Rodney discovers that Big Weld has disappeared, and the slick, shiny Ratchet (Greg Kinnear,As Good As It Gets) is phasing out the spare parts that lumpen robots need to function and replacing them with \"upgrades\"--expensive and glistening new exoskeletons. Unfortunately, from this suitable beginning, the story degenerates into a series of action sequences that make very little sense, though some are kinetic and fun (though others are only there to serve the inevitableRobotsvideo game). Most kids will enjoy the sheer visual pleasure of the movie, but compared to the narrative richness of Pixar movies likeThe IncrediblesandToy Story, that pleasure is pretty short-lived. Also featuring the voices of Robin Williams, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Amanda Bynes, Jennifer Coolidge, and many, many more.--Bret FetzerDVD FeaturesJennifer Coolidge returns as the voice of Aunt Fanny in a mildly amusing new short, \"Aunt Fanny's Tour of Booty,\" which allows her to again be the butt of the joke.  Fans of the characters will enjoy both a 17-minute discussion of the robots' creation as well as profiles of 11 of the bots, including early, almost unrecognizable conceptual sketches and brief interviews with the voice cast.  The original short is fairly dull, and of the three deleted scenes, the most finished is an extended version of Rodney's initial meeting with Tim at the gate.  One other is in sketch form only but does preserve another performance by Robin Williams.  The kids' games are pretty good.  There's a dancing robot that will perform eight routines on command or in random order.  A memory game has a bit of replay value, and the build-a-bot segment takes some thought and investigation.  The Xbox demo is a nifty little diversion that transforms one element (the transport-pod race) of the full-length, single-player Xbox game into a frenetic one- to four-player free-for-all.In their commentary track, director Chris Wedge and producer-inspiration William Joyce have to remind each other to stop patting themselves on the back, but it is interesting to hear them talk about old games such as Mousetrap that played a part in developing the film.  (Wedge's frequent references to a possible \"director's cut\" might not seem like a joke to DVD buyers who have gotten tired of DVD rereleases.)  The commentary track by the Blue Sky technical team might be better, offering insights into the characters and the creation of the film without lapsing into too much techie-speak.--David HoriuchiStills fromRobots(click for larger image)The World ofRobotsThe Art of RobotsRobotssoundtrackRobotsscoreRobotsfor XboxRobotsfor PS2Robotsfor GBA", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006JMLRK", "B000M343BC", "B002WJI2QQ", "B001DPHDCY", "B0012EM5D8", "B004HO6I4M", "B00003CXJ4", "B00CWM58WY", "B000MV9026", "B0006UEVT0", "B001GCUO7A", "0783231474", "B005SDUV4E", "B000RMJ4F8", "B0000640SC", "B000ROAK2W", "B0013FSL3E", "B001LPWGFA", "B004EPZ034", "B001U3D88M", "B000ION23A", "B005LAIISA", "B0000AOX0O", "B000UFIYOO", "B001PR0YEE", "6305161887", "B00029LO0Y", "B008NNY9QW", "B000G75AZC", "B000H7JCK0", "B006JD48LO", "B000L22SG6", "B00B7EQPNE", "B001ECQ75A", "B004AKCME8", "B000AY74OG", "B000VBJEEG", "B00F522C7C", "B000DWMYQ8", "B002ZG97YM", "B008JFUQ16", "B004LWZW7Y", "B000BITUVG", "B0000VV4W2", "B005LAIH4A", "B00003CXG7", "B00005JMQZ", "B00007LVCM", "B0042U94UQ", "B00CHVJODE", "B001PR0Y7Q", "B00E9ZATJO", "B00009M9BK", "0449810798", "B0090SI1RM", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B001KVZ6FW", "1620575175", "B009AMAH3O", "B00I6JOD2S", "B000CZ0PT4", "B0013FSWT2", "B0034G4OYA", "B00AFEX83C", "B000UVKGPI", "B000065V42", "B0039N74CW", "B00JK531ES", "B00HLTD2OE", "B002ZG9904", "B00009YXAW", "6305123454", "B005FLSZQU", "B00005JM7T", "B001GCUNWQ", "B003UESJF6", "B00E00OGE2", "B001HN6918", "B000GUJZ00", "B00I0VTOMG", "B00005JNS0", "B00365F6I2", "B000EQ5UHS", "B000LPS2VI", "B00005JN4W", "B000B8QFYG", "B001NCDFTW", "B0030ZIZRC", "B00CTNYLQA", "B00G5G7EXY", "B007FF3HQM", "B00947N6D8", "B00EBBGLFC", "B005QODEEE", "B00ALMNCLQ", "B00362RUX4", "B00005JN0T", "B000GIXEWC", "B00005TN8K", "B005LAIIT4"], "bought_together": ["B00CWM58WY", "B004HO6I4M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00CWM58WY", "B004HO6I4M", "B002WJI2QQ", "B001DPHDCY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3335}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.95, "brand": "Fox Home Entertainment", "asin": "B00005JNQS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61RM90ARRPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Robots (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Movies don't come any bigger than Peter Jackson'sKing Kong, a three-hour remake of the 1933 classic that marries breathtaking visual prowess with a surprising emotional depth. Expanding on the original story of the blonde beauty and the beast who falls for her, Jackson creates a movie spectacle that matches hisLord of the Ringsfilms and even at times evokes their fantasy world while celebrating the glory of '30s Hollywood. Naomi Watts stars as Ann Darrow, a vaudeville actress down on her luck in Depression-era New York until manic filmmaker Carl Denham (a game but miscast Jack Black) entices her with a lead role. Dazzled by the genius of screenwriter Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody), Ann boards the tramp steamer S.S.Venture, which she--and most of the wary crew--believes is headed for Singapore. Denham, however, is in search of the mythic Skull Island, hoping to capture its wonders on film and make a fortune. What he didn't count on were some scary natives who find that the comely Darrow looks like prime sacrifice material for a mysterious giant creature....There's no point in rehashing the entire plot, as every movie aficionado is more than familiar with the trajectory ofKing Kong; the challenge facing Jackson, his screenwriters, and the phenomenal visual-effects team was to breathe new life into an old, familiar story. To that degree, they achieve what could be best called a qualified success. Though they've assembled a crackerjack supporting cast, including Thomas Kretschmann as theVenture's hard-bitten captain and young Jamie Bell as a plucky crewman, the first third of the movie is rather labored, with too much minute detail given over to sumptuous re-creations of '30s New York and the unexciting initial leg of theVenture's sea voyage. However, once the film finds its way to Skull Island (which bears more than a passing resemblance toLOTR's Mordor),Kongturns into a dazzling movie triumph, by turns terrifying and awe-inspiring. The choreography and execution of the action set pieces--including one involving Kong and a trio of Tyrannosaurus Rexes, as well as another that could be charitably described as a bug-phobic's nightmare--is nothing short of landmark filmmaking, and a certain Mr. Spielberg should watch his back, asKongtrumps most anything that has come before it.Despite the visual challenges ofKing Kong, the movie's most difficult hurdle is the budding romance between Ann and her simian soulmate. Happily, this is where Jackson unqualifiedly triumphs, as this unorthodox love story is tenderly and humorously drawn, by turns sympathetic and wondrous. Watts, whose accessibility balances out her almost otherworldly loveliness, works wonders with mere glances, and Andy Serkis, who digitally embodies Kong here much as he did Gollum in theLOTRfilms, breathes vibrant life into the giant star of the film without ever overplaying any emotions. The final, tragic act of the film, set mostly atop the Empire State Building, is whereKongearns its place in movie history as a work that celebrates both the technical and emotional heights that film can reach.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"bought_together": ["B000EHQTZO", "B00AEFYEU8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EHQTZO", "B00AEFYEU8", "B0087ZG7HK", "0767817478"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 32487}, "categories": [["Movies & TV"]], "price": 8.94, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JO20", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513Y54TGdwL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "King Kong (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "This two-disc collector's edition ofPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chestis packed with over five hours of special features that delve into everything from creating the mythology-inspired Davy Jones and Kraken figures, to working and planning without a completed script, the incredible CGI techniques used in the film, the intense sword training sessions and stunt work, and the unpredictability of filming on location in the Caribbean. The audio commentary by writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio is an interesting and insightful look into the finished film, but perhaps even more revealing is the 25-minute \"Charting the Return\" preproduction diary in which everyone from producer Jerry Bruckheimer to associate director Peter Kohn and writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio give a sense of the enormity of the project of concurrently writing and filming two sequels toPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. The overwhelming logistics of planning and casting without a finished script, scouting and preparing remote locations, constructing a new Black Pearl, and functional props like the rolling water wheel, and cutting costs to stay within budget are nothing less than mind-boggling. In the hourlong \"According to Plan\" feature, director Gore Verbinski, producer Jerry Bruckheimer, and a host of others detail the enormity of the project, focusing on the stamina involved in a 200-day shooting schedule and the need for adaptability and flexibility in dealing with everything from behind schedule excavations to the logistics of shooting on moving water and even the natural fury of a full-blown hurricane.  Shorter featurettes \"Meet Davy Jones: Anatomy of a Legend\" and \"Creating the Kraken\" focus on the mythological creatures in the film and the awesome visual effects and advances in CGI technology that made them possible.  \"Mastering the Blade\" follows Orlando Bloom (Will Turner), Keira Knightley (Elizabeth Swann), and Jack Davenport (Norrington) through some intense sword-fighting training sessions and \"Fly on the Set: The Bone Cage\" offers a frightening look at what it was like to shoot the bone cage scene of the movie.  Other bonus features include bloopers, an interactive tour of Johnny Depp's special makeup effects and wardrobe details, a look at how the 1967 Disney Land Pirates of the Caribbean ride was recently \"re-imagineered\" to incorporate some of the characters and elements from the new movies, producer Jerry Bruckheimer's photo diary, and a glimpse of the glitzy June 24, 2006 red carpet premiere on Disney Land's main street.--Tami Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JM5E", "B005COPWZW", "B004A8ZWUQ", "B0013BM63O", "B00005JN5E", "B004M1A21K", "B004DTLK80", "B000VR0570", "B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY", "B00005JKCH", "B001HN694K", "B00005JPH2", "B00AEFYGBA", "B00BEZTMFY", "B001HQZJMU", "B00E5I2M6I", "B006VRRGNK", "B001BEK8HO", "B000E8M0VA", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B001E75QH0", "B008QE9XD2", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00LG6YEKE", "B00AEBBA72", "B007K3JFUQ", "B000HRMAPE", "B0090SI56Y", "B000E6EK2Y", "B0053FANRC", "B00005JMQW", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B00177YA1K", "B001TK80C0", "B000UR9T8C", "B00003CXI1", "B004EPYZUS", "B00003CXTA", "B001OQCV6A", "B0014Z4ON4", "B005G4TJUC", "B000F7CECK", "B00HFFE8HE", "B001GCUO1Q", "B0087ZG7J8", "B003YAR97K", "B008JFUNTG", "B001GCUO0W", "B000NIBURQ", "B0053FANPY", "B00023B1LC", "B003QO8TOQ", "B002VPE1BQ", "B00F84H73Q", "B003Y5H54W", "B00003CWT6", "B00007AJGH", "B00E5I2M9K", "B000W7F5SS", "B0049IHX2C", "B00000IRE6", "B001F7MSFM", "B000AYELVA", "B002ZG9904", "B000VWYJ86", "B00CFA222M", "B003UYUQZW", "B008UZ949K", "B0002KVUKM", "B000209KMW", "B000UVKGPI", "B0087ZG7HK", "B0000WN140", "B001EZE5BU", "B002PMV9FG", "B000HT386M", "B000NQRR1Q", "B00003CXZ1", "630529142X", "B0002ZDVEU", "B004A8ZWSS", "B00005JM5B", "B000BTITKS", "B00E5I2MEK", "B002HWRYJE", "B001GZ6QC4", "B000W796OM", "B00AQSN7HE", "B0046BI81W", "B001VLBDD0", "B0060FXDCG", "B0084IG8TM", "B005OCFGTO", "B000OLGCIE", "B008JFUS0U", "B00007AJG4", "B009JBWOU0", "B001B3LIOC"], "bought_together": ["B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JM5E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005COPWZW", "B00005JM5E", "B0071JADFU", "B00005JPFX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 72898}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 16.95, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005JP0F", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GQE7TQ72L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}
{"description": "While much was made of the fact thatMarie Antoinetteelicited boos at Cannes, the many favorable reviews attracted less attention. Inspired by Antonia Fraser's biography, Sofia Coppola fashions a portrait that's just as dreamy asThe Virgin Suicides, her first literary adaptation, and the Oscar-winningLost in Translation. Set to a soundtrack of post-punk (a conceit that adds more interest than resonance), the teenaged Marie (Kirsten Dunst, quite good) may be shallow, but she's rarely unsympathetic. The story begins in the late-18th century as the Austrian Archduchess agrees to marry Louis-Auguste (Jason Schwartzman). After bidding adieu to her mother, Maria Theresa (Marianne Faithfull), she travels to France, where King Louis XV (Rip Torn) sets the rules--and the list is endless (Judy Davis' Comtesse de Noailles is the primary enforcer). As for the Dauphin, he's just a boy, really, with more interest in his key collection than their marriage bed. Should Marie produce an heir, it might be enough to sustain her--since life is nothing but an endless shopping spree--but clouds gather on the horizon as an impoverished populace rises up against their extravagant leaders. Coppola merely suggests what happens next, although history paints a darker picture. Filmed in and around the Chateau of Versailles,Marie Antoinetteis a riot of rustling gowns, sparkling jewels, and Manolo Blahnik-designed shoes. To say that style trumps substance does its maker a disservice, but the look of the thing does leave the deepest impression.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's Endis a rollicking voyage in the same spirit of the two earlierPiratesfilms, yet far darker in spots (and nearly three hours to boot). The action, largely revolving around a pirate alliance against the ruthless East India Trading Company, doesn't disappoint, though the violence is probably too harsh for young children. Through it all, the plucky cast (Keira Knightley, Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush) are buffeted by battle, maelstroms, betrayal, treachery, a ferocious Caribbean weather goddess, and that gnarly voyage back from the world's end--but with their wit intact. As always, Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow tosses off great lines ; he chastises \"a woman scorned, like which hell hath no fury than!\" He insults an opponent with a string of epithets, ending in \"yeasty codpiece.\"!In the previousThe Curse of the Black Pearl, Sparrow was killed--sent to Davy Jones' Locker. In the opening scenes, the viewer sees that death has  not been kind to Sparrow--but that's not to say he hasn't found endless ways to amuse himself, cavorting with dozens of hallucinated versions of himself on the deck of the Black Pearl. But Sparrow is needed in this world, so a daring rescue brings him back. Keith Richards' much ballyhooed appearance as Jack's dad is little more than a cameo, though he does play a wistful guitar. But the action, as always, is more than satisfying, held together by Depp, who, outsmarting the far-better-armed British yet again, causes a bewigged commander to muse: \"Do you think he plans it all out, or just makes it up as he goes along?\" As far as fans are concerned, it matters not.--A.T. HurleyOn the DVDHere's something you can't say about just any DVD extras: There appears to bemoreof Keith Richards in the outtakes, interviews, and other special features on theAt World's Enddisc than in the actual film. For those scenes alone, this special edition is well worth the price. Richards looks as woozy and gamey as all the rumors suggested, and answers questions he's not asked, with Johnny Depp sitting next to him, almost acting as a translator. Richards offers pithy comments like, \"Everything I do is original, you better believe,\" and smiles when other cast members call him \"Two-Take Richards\" for supposedly nailing his scenes.The packed second disc also includes a terrific mini-doc on how the filmmakers created the famous maelstrom, in an enormous hanger in Palmdale, California, with the ships floating 30 feet off the ground. \"Just moving theBlack Pearlwas an enormous undertaking,\" says producer Jerry Bruckheimer with serious understatement. Other cool extras include \"Tale of the Many Jacks,\" deleted scenes with great commentary, \"The World of Chow Yun-Fat,\" a bio of composer Hans Zimmer, features on the set designers, a look at the impressive Brethren Court, and some hilarious bloopers. \"You can't curse in a Disney film,\" deadpans Depp when a costar blurts out something blue. \"See?

{"description": "Leonardo DiCaprio puts a handsome face on an ugly industry: In parts of Africa, diamond mining fuels civil warfare, killing thousands of innocents and drafting preteen children as vicious soldiers. DiCaprio (The Departed) plays Danny Archer, a white African soldier-turned-diamond-smuggler who gets wind of a large raw jewel found by Solomon Vandy, a native fisherman (Djimon Hounsou,In America) recently escaped from enslavement by a brutal rebel leader. Archer offers a deal: He'll help Vandy find his war-scattered family if Vandy will share the diamond with him. Drawn into this web of exploitation is journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly,Little Children), who agrees to help if Archer will tell her the details of how conflict diamonds make their way into the hands of the corporations who sell them to the Western world. DiCaprio is compelling because he never flinches from Archer's utter ruthlessness; Archer ends up doing the morally justifiable thing, but only because his desperate greed has led him to it. Hounsou and Connelly, though saddled with all the moral and political speeches, rise above the cant and keep the movie's treacherously formulaic plot rooted in human characters. But in the end, the story won't stick with you as much as the dead stillness in the child soldiers' eyes; the horror of African civil strife refuses to be contained byBlood Diamond's uplifting message--and the movie is all the more potent as a result.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001N44BVQ", "B000M341QE", "B00005JLSB", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00080ZG10", "B004SIP7TE", "B006OFN0SE", "B002ZG980U", "B000NIVJF4", "B0007R4T3U", "B0016Q2D66", "B00049QQHI", "B001EZE5DI", "B00003CWM3", "B00008DP4C", "6305268827", "B000BYA5G4", "B00AEBB9F0", "B000Y7WGOW", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000065U1N", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B000095WW8", "B000U7169M", "B00DHHWXYY", "B000GFLKF8", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002O3Z510", "B002VWNIEA", "B002ZG99N6", "B0007DFJ0G", "B005LAIIJY", "0792839137", "B000KP62SE", "B000P0J0EW", "B000P0J09M", "B007SPPANM", "B00004XPPG", "B000C20VPA", "B00011CZRE", "B002QEHPQU", "B00005JN2Z", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00003CXWV", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00001ZWUS", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00005JN0W", "B002T9H2LA", "B000MTEFXC", "B003L20IG0", "B00AEBB86A", "B00005JKBC", "B0013XZ2QK", "B0000ACOXL", "B005LAIGRS", "B002AT8K9W", "B0007KIFGE", "B00AZNEW5G", "B003ASLJO0", "B000T28PII", "B002DU39GW", "B002ZG97RE", "B000LC55F2", "B00003CXTG", "B00AEBBA36", "B00B0U2SFE", "B003ASLJQI", "B002CPMB9O", "B00BB67UNW", "B000MXPE7O", "0783231202", "B000FVQLQQ", "B00AEFXVCU", "B00AEFXRRO", "B000A3XY5A", "B002JCSWV6", "B00005JNQA", "B004EPYZP8", "B0050MB4OO", "B000P0J0AG", "B000C65Z1G", "B00275EGWY", "B00005B6JZ", "B0006GANPA", "B00AEBB9NM", "B002XMGGK6", "B000C20VRS", "B0007P0XBO", "B003UESJME", "B000QXDED6", "B00AHTYI5M", "B001P9KR8U", "B004A8ZX28", "B008JFUNKU", "B003ASLJQS", "B002VWNICC", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00005BCKF", "B000NOIX48"], "bought_together": ["B000M341QE", "B002ZG980U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEBB8NI", "B00H9KKGTO", "B008MILL8W", "B000BYA5G4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 106777}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.96, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005JPGO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61MN8-6skUL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Blood Diamond (Two-Disc Special Edition)"}

{"description": "One of the first things a viewer notices aboutCloverfieldis that it doesn't play by ordinary storytelling rules, making this intriguing horror film as much a novelty as an event. Told from the vertiginous point-of-view of a camcorder-wielding group of friends,Cloverfieldbegins like a primetime television soap opera about young Manhattanites coping with changes in their personal lives. Rob (Michael Stahl-David) is leaving New York to take an executive job at a company in Japan. At his goodbye party in a crowded loft, Rob&#x92;s brother Jason (Mike Vogel) hands a camcorder to best friend Hud (T.J. Miller), who proceeds to tape the proceedings over old footage of Rob&#x92;s ex-girlfriend, Beth (Odette Yustman)--images shot during happy times in that now-defunct relationship. Naturally, Beth shows up at the party with a new beau, bumming Rob out completely. Just before one's eyes glaze over from all this heartbreaking stuff (captured by Hud, who's something of a doofus, in laughably shaky camerawork), the unexpected happens: New York is suddenly under attack from a Godzilla-like monster stomping through midtown and destroying everything and everybody in sight. Rob and company hit the streets, but rather than run with other evacuees, they head toward the center of the storm so that Rob can rescue an injured Beth. There are casualties along the way, but the journey into fear is fascinating and immediate if emotionally remote--a consequence of seeing these proceedings through the singular, subjective perspective of a camcorder and of a story that intentionally leaves major questions unanswered: Who or what is this monster? Where did it come from? The lack of a backstory, and spare views of the marauding creature, are clever ways by producer J.J. Abrams and director Matt Reeves to keep an audience focused exclusively on what&#x92;s on the screen.  But it also makesCloverfieldcuriously uninvolving. Ultimately,Cloverfield, with its spectacular effects brilliantly woven into a home-video look, is a celebration of infinite possibilities in this age of accessible, digital media.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B004EPYZQ2", "B00IO9D3ZI", "B00EMMDMKM", "B002SJIO5E", "B0044ZOI32", "B001AR0D4A", "B004BZ5AMS", "B001MVYUQQ", "B003BJO8KU", "B0018AG6X6", "B005LAIGPU", "B00IO8VMB6", "B000PKG8SS", "B003Y5H5GU", "B00BPA2PGG", "B0017U7PT6", "B001YV502C", "B0013FBS20", "B008JFUR10", "B001KZVQJI", "B001CW7ZW6", "B0035WTJFW", "B000Y7U98W", "B003ABZGRI", "B000VDDWEC", "B000VDDWEM", "B002JT69IM", "B00164EAC8", "B002ZG981E", "B00AEFXORM", "B001DZOC3W", "B008SAPC20", "B003Y5H59M", "B00HERVMTK", "B00AVSFIV2", "B0032KNA4I", "B000L212HW", "B001FB55I0", "B0018O4YSQ", "B002ZG997M", "B002ZG9788", "B008G33O0G", "B000VDDWE2", "B00K2CHVSK", "B001GCUO5W", "B005J4TLQG", "B000PC6A3E", "B0027VT9ES", "B001F7MSG6", "B0051T46XM", "B00111YM60", "B001GZ6QEC", "B002HR1W1K", "B004SIPA4G", "B001OQCVII", "B001JNNDBA", "B001GKJ2FC", "B000WQWPKA", "B000OT6V00", "B0021L8UXK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004EPYZQ2", "B00IO8VMB6", "B004LWZW4W", "B005LAIHY0"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPXY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Wm5GO98oL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cloverfield [Theatrical Release]"}

If your idea of a good time is watching a mangy dog urinate into the vacant eye socket of a corpse, this is just the movie for you! In an attempt to create a new horror icon like Freddy Krueger or Jason Voorhees, former porno director Gregory Dark and less-than-stellar screenwriter Dan Madigan have dreamed up a routine plot that's hardly original, but deviously addictive to anyone who digs this kind of stuff: Eight troubled and not-very-bright teens, fresh out of a detention center, are given a second chance when they're taken to the decrepit, filthy Blackwell Hotel and told to clean the place up so it can be turned into a homeless shelter. What they don't know is that the hotel hides a secret, axe-wielding resident named Jacob Goodnight (played by WWE superstar Glen \"Kane\" Jacobs) who's got a knack for plucking the eyeballs from his hapless and ill-fated victims. He's basically an evil kid in the hulking body of a wrestler (call it type-casting, if you will), andSee No Evilis more sick than scary as Jacob does his handiwork, which includes the rather hilarious and grimly ironic dispatch of an animal rights activist, to name just one item in the movie's smorgasbord of splatter. At a brisk 85 minutes, the movie's over before you can work up any genuine terror. Still, a sequel seems likely (even if it's straight-to-video), and devoted horror fans will want to check it out.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B001LPWGC8", "B00009ZPU3", "B003L20IF6", "B000SM6FKY", "B002S0OB8W", "B0021L8UG2", "B001053038", "B001QB9H2E", "B000RGN2IY", "B001B1876G", "B002NPY7F4", "B0029XFN94", "B001R10BIC", "B002DKGWSO", "B00546031G", "B004SEUJVO", "B003PBYSTA", "B004RQDWIU", "B003Y5H4SY", "B002QVFOOI", "B000I5XOV4", "B00275EHDW", "B005LS4MUA", "B00005JOWW", "B003C5FMJE", "B003Q6D282", "B000KX0HH8", "B005DCJ218", "B004SIP9GK", "B004634VFM", "B0021L8UHQ", "B001AQMBHI", "B000HCO80E", "B001RHGRSY", "B00194XBPW", "B0029O0BMC", "B004CJB0A4", "B0021L8UQ2", "B001MFNB4E", "B003Y5H5G0", "B000EWBKLC", "B000O5B4CE", "B00LLAV26O", "B002JT69IM", "B0058O1FNO", "B002CVQAX6", "B002CVQAXQ", "B001FBJUXG", "B005DCJ1J6", "B00AIBZL14", "B001MVYUQQ", "B004GGQMUQ", "B008XAT118", "B0029O0BJU", "B004LOUD80", "B002NPY7EU", "B003H9LIRA", "B004BLTNL6", "B001M9ELP8", "B0021L8UXK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002QVFOOI", "B0057YUV6C", "B00E8RK5OC", "B000UJ48UO"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JOZS", "imUrl": "http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-site/icons/no-img-sm._CB192198896_.gif", "title": "See no Evil Art Prints &amp; Posters"}
{"description": "The Dark Knightarrives with tremendous hype (best superhero movie ever? posthumous Oscar for Heath Ledger?), and incredibly, it lives up to all of it.  But calling it the best superhero movie ever seems like faint praise, since part of what makes the movie great--in addition to pitch-perfect casting, outstanding writing, and a compelling vision--is that it bypasses the normal fantasy element of the superhero genre and makes it all terrifyingly real.  Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is Gotham City's new district attorney, charged with cleaning up the crime rings that have paralyzed the city. He enters an uneasy alliance with the young police lieutenant, Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), and Batman (Christian Bale), the caped vigilante who seems to trust only Gordon--and whom only Gordon seems to trust. They make progress until a psychotic and deadly new player enters the game: the Joker (Heath Ledger), who offers the crime bosses a solution--kill the Batman. Further complicating matters is that Dent is now dating Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, after Katie Holmes turned down the chance to reprise her role), the longtime love of Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne.In his last completed role before his tragic death, Ledger is fantastic as the Joker, a volcanic, truly frightening force of evil. And he sets the tone of the movie: the world is a dark, dangerous place where there are no easy choices.  Eckhart and Oldman also shine, but as good as Bale is, his character turns out rather bland in comparison (not uncommon for heroes facing more colorful villains). Director-cowriter Christopher Nolan (Memento) follows his critically acclaimedBatman Beginswith an even better sequel that sets itself apart from notable superhero movies likeSpider-Man 2andIron Manbecause of its sheer emotional impact and striking sense of realism--there are no suspension-of-disbelief superpowers here. At 152 minutes, it's a shade too long, and it's much too intense for kids. But for most movie fans--and not just superhero fans--The Dark Knightis a film for the ages.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B000PC6A3E", "B002ZG981E", "B00G4RD4PQ", "B0039208QM", "B001GMALGY", "B00E2Y0YBK", "B00C2IGQBA", "B0039208JE", "B00H14WTLQ", "B0039208CG", "B0085D3I3K", "B0039208C6", "B000M5AJQI", "B00319ECGK", "B001FB55H6", "B00EIG5M5A", "7020070078", "B00E2Y6AUY", "B00D5FMGGS", "B001OQCV6K", "B0013FBS20", "B000Q6GX5Y", "B001GKJ2FC", "B00FPS79F6", "B001992NUQ", "B004JMSIRC", "B001RIY4WE", "B00DYEN6XC", "B008QZ5PY2", "B001F7MSG6", "B00FAHYNWE", "B00J7PRJXU", "B001AQT0Z4", "B001UV4XEW", "B0083SBJXS", "B00AEFY552", "B00C8RD79O", "B007KAJG3K", "B007L4HET8", "B004EPZ07U", "B007L4HFDI", "B00AEFXKOO", "B000PC0U1W", "B00C6B8TB8", "B00HINFI4K", "B003TT2X6I", "B001KZIRM2", "B002ZG99NG", "B00EZ4M68G", "B004SIP90G", "B003ZHR6RK", "B001GCUO16", "B003TT2X6S", "B00JNEWSLS", "B001F3FUK6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00DUCXFUC", "B004LWZWGK", "B002ZG981E", "B000PC6A3E"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JPY0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pGxSkkz4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Dark Knight [Theatrical Release]"}

{"description": "If you're looking for a different kind of anime,Sakura Diariesmight just fit the bill. It's a clever, quirky romantic comedy spiced up with lots of goofy humor and a splash of R-rated eroticism. Tuoma Inaba is your average country-boy loose in the big city. He arrives in Tokyo to take his college entrance exams, but Tuoma's not too bright and he fails them all. In short order our hero enrolls in a cram school, poses as a student at the prestigious Keio University in order to pursue one beautiful girl, and moves in with another--his cousin Urara who has a huge crush on him. Then things start to get complicated. This collector's edition contains all 12 episodes ofSakura Diaries. Because it is based on an uncensored version of the Japanese original, there are several differences between it and the earlier multivolume release on VHS and DVD. The plot remains essentially the same, but there's more nudity and newly translated subtitles, and there is no English dub. If you already own the earlier edition and don't care about a few extra seconds of skin, you probably don't need the collector's edition, but for completists and those new toSakura Diaries, this is the definitive version.--Simon Leake", "related": {"also_bought": ["B007V9ECWU", "B00GS1JRPY", "B0081AWUI6", "B005NQ5LM8", "B00HXEWDDS", "B00CU6WBFE", "B0002ZYE5U", "B00114UUMW", "B0002C4JGW", "B008YRL7JE", "B00CU6WBMW", "B003VOVW90", "B0043988G2", "B0001Z3HRW", "B00D39UQ2W", "B001N2WJ1W", "B00EKGX4GW", "B008UQURWM", "B000BRBA7E", "B0023S4A12", "B00HXEWFUY", "B0049TC8C6", "B00A8306US", "B0010358CQ", "B000KJU1LE", "B003H6KRM0", "B0030ZOYIQ", "B005W2BWSA", "B004XC5LPA", "B0083QJW7A", "B001PSUM04", "B001QUXNMA", "B003NE8B5Q", "B001VKSPUU", "B000AARKF8", "B001F2U714", "B000056MWR", "B000063JZE", "B00005TPCD", "B008AX7SP4", "B00004Y9PW", "B000066IXV", "B000P6R5KC", "B000MV8AO0", "B004VRK4BS", "B002W981QM", "B0006SSQWU", "B001GTFP18", "B002CWKTR8", "B007V2LN10", "6305858357", "B00A3TFJ18", "B002CWKTQE", "B0000C52FN", "B00000I1SE", "B0010HOZKI", "B009RG4LBM", "B00BKBCDRQ", "B002FOQY36", "B007USWCWO", "B00DSAUK9U", "B000T4T8Z0", "B004JST244", "B000ADKWM8", "B00441GYWE", "B000NIBUXU", "B0030BOCFK", "B000095J66", "B00HQI72WS", "B002EP8TT8", "B00006CY43", "B00B04KVOA", "B0055CAITQ", "B000CEV396", "B00007JZO2", "B00006CY4F", "B00006CY41", "B003CP62DY", "B004FZWDRO", "B00008NGC0", "B006XDU7X8", "B00127R2WO", "B000G73USQ", "B000BPL2JW", "B000A2XA5K", "B000ASATK8", "B00B2TUCBA", "B000F2CAHE", "B000JU8H6U", "B0048EAYR8", "B000ADKWNW", "B000JJ4F8U", "B000JJ4F9E", "B002FOQXSC", "B000VKL6RU", "B008KZX7QQ", "B002P8LK68", "B006VXG6XA", "B0041420O0", "B0039UAA7Q"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007BMIGII", "B005NQ5LM8", "B007V9ECWU", "B009SQWOHY"]}, "price": 15.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 63334}, "asin": "B00005QFDT", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51A12G3HCCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sakura Diaries - Complete Series Collector's Edition"}
{"description": "Fans of Freddie Prinze Jr. will no doubt enjoySummer Catch, which features Freddie running through sprinklers on a baseball diamond wearing nothing but an orange thong. Freddie plays Ryan, an aspiring pitcher at baseball camp. Ryan grew up in the New England town that hosts the camp, mowing lawns with his landscaping father, so he's torn between his local friends and his new baseball buddies.

With  the same attention to emotional detail that he brought toMoonstruck, Jewison establishes a delicate balance of anguish  and bittersweet humor, reaching peak intensity as two couples confront  the aftershocks of infidelity. Dennis Quaid and Andie MacDowell play  the steady pair, committed to surviving every marital peak and valley.  Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette are splitting up, divided by his  infidelity and forced to reevaluate connections to their long-term  friends. While Jewison and cinematographer Roger Deakins expertly  translate the stagy material, the revealing, nonjudgmental quality of  Margulies's dialogue inspires excellence from this quartet of  underrated actors.

Parker plays Colleen, a good girl with a bad boyfriend named Dick. This problem is solved when she kills him within the film's first few moments. The rest of the movie is filled with wackiness, some of which hits and some of which misses. The plot isn't a bad one, with bits of information cleverly revealed through flashbacks and at least one pretty good twist, and the terrific (and sadly underused) Teri Garr appears in a cameo that she could do standing on her head.Life Without Dickis best suited for Harry Connick Jr. fans, as he spends most of the movie being affably handsome, and the other characters repeatedly beg him to sing.

A  hazardous-materials-cleanup company has been hired to eliminate asbestos  tiles and other toxic material from a gigantic mental hospital that had  been shut down in the 1980s. But as one member of the team starts to nose  into old files in the office, he uncovers a series of tape recordings of  psychiatric sessions--nine of them--related to a notorious sexual abuse  case. Soon, toxic materials and dark spirits start to merge. LikeThe  Blair Witch Project(and most horror movies, really),Session 9is longer on atmosphere and dream logic than story--but the atmosphere is  effectively unsettling.

{"description": "William Castle's tribute to the gothic horrors of the 1930s is a ghoulish spin onDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hydeby way ofEyes Without a Face. The mysterious Baron Sardonicus (Guy Rolfe) lives in a lonely Central European castle, hiding his face behind a mask and his sadism behind aristocratic manners. Neither remains hidden for long as he pressures a London doctor (Ronald Lewis) into working miracles on his hideously disfigured face. Oskar Homolka steals the film as the Baron's loyal, long-suffering servant Krull, who wields surgical knives and slimy leeches in his reign of torture. Castle, less a stylist than a showman, has little feeling for mood but knows how to stage a shock and spring a gimmick, and this film features a doozy: the audience-participation \"Punishment Poll,\" hosted by Castle himself in a clever (if improbable) break before the film's satisfyingly devious finale.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005N5RQ", "B001BSBBGC", "B00000K3U3", "B00005V4XE", "B001DXS4DI", "B00HHYF59S", "B000ATQYWY", "B006TBYC76", "B00009NHC0", "B0047DKLE6", "B000AL733G", "B00027JYMG", "B00000ILEU", "B00DZP1C9K", "B001ARDBXU", "B002GLG5OQ", "B0087ZG7PW", "B002G1K82Q", "0803282680", "6305650594", "B0000W5H7E"], "bought_together": ["B00005N5RQ", "B00000K3U3"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BUWD7Q6", "B00BUWD7XO", "B00005N5RQ", "B0024FAG3U"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 97502}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 31.54, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005V4XF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TREVDVZJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Mr. Sardonicus"}
{"description": "A veritable gold mine of rarities and little-known treats,Slapstick Encyclopedialives up to its title as a stupendous compendium of silent-era comedy. Spanning the entire spectrum of slapstick from 1909 to 1927, this definitive collection (curated by film historians David Shepard and Joe Adamson) dutifully credits Keystone Cops creator Mack Sennett as the founder of the slapstick phenomenon. But it reaches far beyond Sennett (who alienated most of his popular stars) to acknowledge nearly every major and minor slapstick star and style. The development of slapstick, which had its roots in vaudeville, is witnessed chronologically, mixing the manic pie-fight sensibility of Sennett's Keystone hits with the lesser-known, more sophisticated parlor-room comedy of Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Drew, while legendary black vaudevillian Bert Williams plies his popular trade in a Biograph short from 1916.Early appearances by Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Fatty Arbuckle, Ben Turpin, Oliver Hardy, Stan Laurel, and others demonstrate the gradual emergence of the popular personalities (like Chaplin's Little Tramp) that would dominate silent comedy at its peak, establishing timeless screen icons and forever altering Hollywood's way of doing business. But the real strength of this set is its wide scope, unearthing neglected talents ripe for rediscovery (like Charley Bowers and Larry Semon), and allowing the viewer to witness the evolution of gags from simple improvisation to the elaborately planned chase-oriented routines that emerged in the early 1920s. With print quality ranging from good to pristine, and original musical accompaniment by six of the world's leading silent-movie musicians, this 18-hour, 50-film laugh-athon is surely one of the finest DVD sets ever produced.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00097DXG2", "B002TCRQNG", "B004XEEMA8", "B00D8HNRBG", "B00AIA89ZA", "B00JRHW4GK", "B008PVQQ3G", "B002A2B348", "B00IPAORL0", "1497372755", "B001FD6MJO", "B000TJ6PHY", "B00FNRA7VW", "B00HE010LC", "B000A7DVMM", "B000B5XORA", "B004YOEGA8", "B00049QQ78", "B00J84NGBE", "B00HMCT8H0", "B00BX49BGQ", "B00BX49C3S", "B00006IUIU", "B00D9BNOKK", "B00D2CRP42", "B005DKS1W6", "B00A1AU6VM", "B005BYBZKY", "B00BY0EBDC", "B00IF0KASY", "B0041T50J2", "B003F10EOI", "B00AFQSZB0", "B001D8W77W", "B00D9BNONW", "B003H221M8", "B000WC8CLU", "B00D4C6780", "B0054602XK", "B0009S4IKG", "B00CPR3RB0", "0615916007", "B0002CHIDS", "B00HFWETIK", "630507559X", "B00GBT61YS", "B004MQ6W5K", "B000F4TMIW", "B004G9UXDK", "B000UAE7K4", "B000B5XORU", "B008BWFOSC", "B008I3Q0FK", "B003N2JKOO", "B0016A2FHO", "B001FB9L3U", "B00895CC90", "1593932685", "B0002CHIEM", "B00BF36ZXC", "B00000JMOO", "B003GOOYT0", "B00K6D1S7A", "B0002CHIEC", "B001QFFBAM", "B007DIQCXG", "B0009S4IJM", "B004RBC5HE", "B00A1AU720", "B007N5YJPC", "B00004Z4W3", "B00B2BYXQI", "B004IF4EYQ", "B000QXDFS0", "B004RBC5QU", "B00AWXI700", "B004RBC5KQ", "B0083V2W04", "B000E1EHQI", "B00HVJZ562", "B008Z0D5L8", "B00FJYXQCG", "B00JSC8BMU", "B002YNQEFG", "B0024FAG8A", "B005SDB7VK", "B008ZDC7M8", "B0083V2VZK", "B000BB14ZS", "B0057IY5EW", "B000E6ESX0", "B00AEBB9QY", "B008MIYKS0", "B003YBNNMY", "B00ARKYSWE", "B0002HOEJY", "B004RBC5M4", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B000E8JO32", "B000XA5K0M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00097DXG2", "B002TCRQNG", "B001FD6MJO", "B002A2B348"]}, "price": 14.62, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 293055}, "asin": "B00005Y6YV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51kv6qd5ihL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Slapstick Encyclopedia"}
{"description": "This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. As its ratings following the tragic events of September 11, 2001, illustrated,Friendshas matured into television's most beloved comfort show. The peerless ensemble--Jennifer Aniston, a pre-Arquette Courtney Cox, Emmy winner Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, and David Schwimmer--makes a lasting first impression in the first season's 24 episodes, which are presented chronologically on four discs. The perky \"Pilot\" introduces unlucky-in-love Monica, runaway bride Rachel, sad sack Ross, New Age ditz Phoebe, wise guy Chandler, and womanizer Joey. The focus of the first season is Ross's unrequited love for Rachel, but we have these moments to remember: the arrival of Marcel the monkey (\"The One with the Monkey\"); Monica, Rachel, and Phoebe's \"cleansing ritual\" (\"The One with the Candy Hearts\"); the escalating game of shower peek-a-boo (\"The One with the Boobies\"); Joey as Al Pacino's butt double (\"The One with the Butt\"); Ross taking lessons from Joey in how to \"talk dirty\" (\"The One with the Stoned Guy\"); former \"Must-See TV\" stars Helen Hunt and George Clooney (\"The One with Two Parts\"); and Chandler spilling the beans to Rachel about Ross's feelings for her (\"The One Where Rachel Finds Out\"). Though its devoted fans can recite these episodes chapter and verse,Friendsmaintains its sparkle through repeat viewings, a testament to the sharp writing as well as the cast's lightning-in-a-bottle chemistry and lived-in performances. The episodes are presented uncut and extended, with previously unseen dialogue and scenes. And those who hateFriendsand would like to drown the characters in the opening credits' fountain are directed to the episode \"The One with the Boobies,\" in which guest star Fisher Stevens hilariously nails the \"dysfunctional group dynamic ... co-dependent, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffeehouse and you're all like, 'Define me, define me.'\" Among the set's special features are an informative \"Pilot\" episode commentary by the show's creators, who at one point reveal that Monica was originally conceived as a Janeane Garafalo type (how's that for a road not traveled?).

{"description": "The Hearseis an example of a horror movie subgenre: the demon-possessed vehicle. When Jane Hardy inherits her late aunt's home, she faces just such a vehicle in the form of a vintage hearse. Tormented by the car and harassed by mysterious townsfolk, Jane has to unlock her aunt's hidden secrets or perish. Part of the suspense comes from wondering if Jane is being tormented by the supernatural, her fragile emotional state, or someone just trying to scare Jane off her property.Possessed-car suspensers can be surprisingly effective and frightening. Unfortunately, this movie is a fairly low-budget effort, offering up many standard suspense techniques that were pretty shopworn even in 1980. The end result is a film that is predictable, and has few if any real chills.

Henry (Arye Gross) is an artist living in New York but still carrying a torch for the guy he had a crush on in high school.

His high school crush has since married, had children, and divorced--and seems ready to take some very different steps with his life. Big Eden is one of those implausibly tolerant towns where lesbians kiss each other in public and old coots in cowboy hats try to play matchmaker with bashful gays. Still, it's this sweet warmth inBig Edenthat has made it a festival crowd-pleaser.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008UALE", "B0000560PU", "B0006GVJEY", "B00GWWV1XU", "B00005QAQD", "B0013D8LCW", "B00000F5B5", "B0002I84JO", "B0001HAGRE", "B00HHYF5EI", "B00FGG60XY", "B0042KZJFA", "B0084BM7NK", "B004XKUFY4", "B00F98FOPE", "B000BZISX0", "B001Y7CVXC", "B002PCVLWW", "B00GHP8SH4", "0780629167", "B00996RSYM", "B00E849QSG", "B002SSNFUO", "B004L03B3S", "B0083V2VYG", "B001NGNLEW", "B0062QHZJU", "B0080JX4Y2", "B0042L0OG8", "B0042L0OFE", "B0000DD75N", "B00GSA3K6C", "B0096UG7XY", "B000WDVNMO", "B00F878KAC", "B00FPVGWY2", "B00I4CWIVU", "B00HUQCA28", "B000SQJ28C", "B00014NE62", "B00013WVI0", "B000UNYJOK", "B00DUJH94S", "B005GM38MO", "B009J212G6", "B00CMQIDKY", "B000FTJ74Q", "6305744777", "B00FYL08RK", "B006FYYWQS", "B00EU8RB14", "B007OXB1GI", "B002L1YGRY", "B009W8MYK0", "B000087F0X", "B000GBEWIO", "B000R7G9JW", "B00118S6CY", "B005OTQIK8", "B007L6JQ3S", "B0000B1A36", "B00HQKREFG", "B000053VAW", "B00316DDZY", "B004KA1DGG", "B000NVT0UM", "B000I2J5TM", "B008JFX04G", "B00G3MXSW6", "B000F6II1M", "B00IJZMZW4", "B0000C23FY", "B008N25X7M", "B00CKZE7FC", "1573624381", "B00DUJH8V2", "B004RIACU4", "B000VKJ6UE", "B00HUTPKA4", "B003Y9NXDK", "B008BKQZNW", "B00IA7MFEO", "B00CC2V7AQ", "B000CDSS72", "1884190618", "B00008R9KD", "B00E44FEAE", "B00JESQSY6", "B00IEA3LKE", "B00E99FYOK", "B00B4MMQJ6", "B00B2DGYQS", "B000092T3P", "B00JVX8194", "B007IV4ODS", "B00564HZYY", "B002ZG9800", "B005TIK4SQ"], "bought_together": ["B00008UALE", "B0000560PU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00F98FOPE", "B00E849QSG", "B00008UALE", "B00GWWV1XU"]}, "price": 13.48, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 80590}, "asin": "B0000639HT", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JY82C5HHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Big Eden"}
{"description": "Grab your favorite munchies, kids. Red and Meth, that dope-addled dynamic duo, are going to Harvard! And while it's not an episode ofMasterpiece Theatre,How Highis destined to become a guilty pleasure of the cannabis crowd. The plot's a familiar one--take the basic selling points of any Cheech & Chong movie (a pair of shambolic protagonists who smoke lots of weed while slinging slang and driving funky, '70s-style cars), graft them onto a generic \"raising hell on campus\" teen movie scenario, and shake vigorously. The result is a prosaic effort that does contain some all-too-brief moments of genuine humor. Red and Meth, a.k.a. Redman and Method Man, may look like the world's oldest freshmen, but both offer genial performances, especially Method Man, who imbues the character of Silas with a dog-eared gentleness that raises him above the film's leaden script and plasticine directing.--Rebecca Levine", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006HBZE2", "B00006HAYO", "B004P7CMZ0", "B000069DOB", "B001DJLD12", "B000EMGJAO", "6304821832", "B00003CY51", "B0000YEE6M", "0780631234", "B007VYEE0A", "6305505780", "B004H83INW", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B004SIP93S", "B001J9KJ4I", "B0002J4YVK", "B000BITV9W", "B00AEFYE08", "1558908390", "B002CA68MU", "B000UNYJWM", "0767813901", "B002CA68NO", "B00003GPFT", "B00ANDDBBY", "B000FS9ULC", "B00007ELEO", "B00005JLQT", "B00000JGHV", "B0000AGQ6T", "B002GSXKO2", "B00005JLG1", "B002CA68N4", "B0000714BU", "B0041QSZ9M", "B00004Y2R1", "0767811070", "0767821955", "B00AEFYAC0", "B00AG4714S", "B0000AC8LH", "B000CPH9PM", "B000JRYOPG", "0783237367", "B000071ZZJ", "B000EQ45CE", "B0000JBUHI", "B00007BK2S", "B000IZJZIU", "B00003CXS7", "0780627822", "B00AMSM9AO", "B00003CXPS", "B000060MWA", "B000WZEZGI", "B001AEF6HM", "B0000TWMTS", "B004QL7K70", "B001TUZGPO", "B00E1HIXA2", "B000089729", "B005SHBO1Y", "B000RETOHO", "B00E1HIX66", "B0000TWMWK", "B00068WOH8", "B0019X3YZA", "B00003CXWV", "B000VG66XS", "B0034G4P1C", "B000C20VRS", "B00009W5F2", "B002GSXKOM", "B003NH6FY2", "B00005JLQE", "B000SM6FLI", "B00005JD5J", "B00AEFYQWO", "B00029RTAI", "B008DL4KZY", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00066FAQW", "B00DW5IL2E", "B0041QSZS8", "B00AEBB9AA", "B00BLN4V46", "B00007BK2T", "B004499NII", "B002VWNIEA", "630529142X", "B00005JKMN", "B00AEFXPG2", "B00AMEZDJW", "B0023TCWE8", "B002FOFX9M", "B00441GYVA", "B000HDZKLO", "B002CA68MK", "B00AEFYZCU"], "bought_together": ["B0006HBZE2", "B000EMGJAO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0006HBZE2", "B001DJLD12", "B004H83INW", "B000EMGJAO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10968}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.68, "brand": "UNI DIST CORP.

In \"The Quiz Show,\" restless housewife Lucy turns to a television contest for fun and the opportunity to win $1,000. \"The Audition,\" one of the series' most beloved stories, finds Ball exercising her considerable skills as a physical comic by pretending to be a professional clown named Buffo. Finally, \"The Seance\" is one of the best of Lucy's misadventures with best friend, Ethel (Vivian Vance), this time participating in a riotous ritual to wake the dead. Marvelous stuff.

{"description": "Naked Gun: From the Files of the Police Squad!David Zucker--of the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker creative troika behindAirplane!and television'sPolice Squad!--directed  this 1988 feature film based on the latter show. Leslie Nielsen returns  to his old TV role of Lt. Frank Drebin, the deadpan idiot with a  detective's badge. The reinvention of the failed series as a theatrical  feature seems to have inspired everyone involved to make a pretty funny  movie, and the jokes gather a momentum that lasts until the final act.  Ricardo Montalban is a perfect foil as a villain whose aquarium is being  invaded by Drebin during routine questioning, and George Kennedy is  delightful in a self-parodying part as an earnest but obtuse lawman.  There's a hilarious bit when Drebin--wearing a live police wire while  going to the bathroom--can be overheard over the loudspeakers at a  speech given by a flustered mayor (Nancy Marchand). Yes, that's O.J.  Simpson as a detective who ends up on the wrong side of numerous Drebin  blunders.--Tom KeoghNaked Gun: 2 1/2 - The Smell of FearIt's more of Leslie Nielsen's Lt. Frank Drebin, the bumbling cop from the oldPolice Squad!television series. This time, Drebin uncovers a plot--led by  supervillain Robert Goulet!--to sabotage America's energy policy. The  jokes don't stick as well as those of the first film (Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!),  but there are some very funny slapstick moments, including several  involving former First Lady Barbara Bush (played by an actress, of  course).--Tom KeoghNaked Gun: 3 1/3 - The Final InsultThe usual way of the world is that sequels amount to thinner and thinner carbon copies of the original. But not in the case ofNaked Gunmovies, which only seemed to get funnier with each new entry. This  third episode in the series finds Lieutenant Frank Drebin (Leslie  Nielsen) retired from his police squad and married to the woman of his  dreams (Priscilla Presley). But he is pressed back into action to  infiltrate a group of terrorists who plan to blow up the Oscars. The  filmmakers make hay with spoofs of prison films and, particularly, of  the Oscars themselves, in an award-show send-up that includes such  real-life stars as Raquel Welch and Pia Zadora--and Drebin being  mistaken for Phil Donahue. The takeoff on the dreadful production  numbers that always drag out the Academy Awards will have you howling.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AMSQBRQ", "B000H7JCFK", "B000K405CY", "6305428263", "B00AEFXDO6", "B00AEFXDAK", "B0001ZX0O2", "B001Q8MMC4", "B00BTYFWEA", "0792844890", "B0001Z4OXS", "B002GOAGYI", "B00005V5NQ", "B000G6BLW4", "B002GSXKPG", "B000067J1Z", "B000PHX5MI", "B0019HQICW", "B005NKIPUO", "B00287Z18Y", "6305268797", "B004H83IM8", "B000M341R8", "B003CRM6PA", "B000067J1Y", "B00441GYQ0", "B000G6BLWE", "B000E6ESIK", "B002L7O7XG", "B002O3Z4YI", "B008MXMFVE", "B00AEFXXMI", "6305840083", "B000LBL3TK", "B000MGBLSC", "B001AEF6C2", "B0009IOR5M", "B00005O3VC", "B0000A02TZ", "B0008JIJ2O", "B000K7VHTQ", "B00AEFXDGE", "B0000A14TA", "B0000A02TY", "B000U1ZV8K", "B000G6BLRE", "079073849X", "B000Z8GZYW", "B00AEFYVMO", "1558908412", "B00AEBB99Q", "B00AMSQBUI", "B0089Q1TPM", "0767821467", "B0000AVH9Q", "B00004TJMW", "B000CEXFC4", "B000E6ESJ4", "B000WGYMGK", "B00AEFXP8K", "0783225520", "B0006FO578", "B000BKJ762", "B000FOQ1KY", "B002GSXKOW", "B0009IW8OE", "B0009P42WI", "B00AEBB9DM", "0783226926", "B00005PJ6O", "B00COHGOMU", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000F9RLL2", "B0009S4J3C", "B00DDNMQGC", "B00AEFXIUK", "B000G6BLQU", "B0054OGQM8", "B00AEFYKWU", "B00AEFXPG2", "B00GT83J1E", "B004SIP95G", "B0009UC810", "B008R65XKQ", "B000055Y0X", "B006TTC5GS", "B0016MJ6J2", "0783235070", "B000AP04L0", "B00AEBB9E6", "B002N57KG2", "B000M7XR9W", "B002GSXKOC", "B001U3ZYWU", "6305308748", "0792166493", "0792844866", "B000WMFZJW", "B00407PO3W", "B00005JOJE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AMSQBUI", "B00AMSQBRQ", "B000H7JCFK", "B00AEFXDO6"]}, "price": 13.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 57463}, "asin": "B000065U35", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41932SFNERL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Naked Gun DVD Gift Set"}

This one-of-a-kind documentary was originally conceived as a portrait of 21-year-old Tony Benetatos, a firefighter trainee at Manhattan's Duane Street firehouse, located seven blocks from the World Trade Center. By the time filming was finished, brothers Jules and Gedeon Naudet had captured history in the making, including the only image of the first jetliner striking Tower 1, and the only footage fromwithinthe tower as it collapsed. This is not, however, a film about the murderous nightmare of terrorism. It's the ultimate rite-of-passage drama, more immediate and meaningful than any fiction film could be, with Benetatos and his supportive colleagues emerging as heroes of the first order. Sensitively narrated by codirector and fellow firefighter James Hanlon,9/11will endure forever as a tribute to those, living and dead, who witnessed hell on that sunny Tuesday morning.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001F5274G", "B004WCSMDE", "B00006BS70", "B005KBJC0I", "B00827OX5Q", "B000FUF6QI", "B0027OJBQG", "B0000B1OBZ", "B000JLTRIQ", "B000GH3CR0", "B00HEUXKOC", "B004X7UAMO", "1576871304", "B005IG5K6A", "B0009IW89Y", "B005VU9KW8", "B000EYJHDS", "B000069503", "B000065Q9C", "B000GYHRHO", "B000ARXF7S", "0670031712", "1426208073", "B002FOQY7M", "B00D99XPBU", "0316525405", "1595800212", "B0014CKCEC", "B00F12IRSO", "B00ENP2QZA", "B001E5FYS8", "B000AQ69SQ", "B0007QS31U", "1451626665", "B00063MCHA", "B0006L0L5C", "B000260NTK", "B00018D4PO", "B000OPOAR0", "B00005JKNC", "B0016N52IK", "B00006ADG4", "B00006L92T", "6305756430", "B001NDLEJO", "B00H83EUQW", "B000059H9A", "B00GLP8488", "B000J10F14", "B00D2UMHGA", "B00000JS6F", "B00AEFYENK", "B000GG4Y32", "B002JI94J4", "B00641Y2ZS"], "bought_together": ["B001F5274G", "B004WCSMDE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004WCSMDE", "B001F5274G", "B00827OX5Q", "B005KBJC0I"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 51765}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 102.8, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B00006B1HI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41tAUOhmcWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "9/11 - The Filmmakers' Commemorative Edition"}

{"description": "In the words of They Might Be Giants' rollicking Grammy-winning theme song, \"life is unfair.\" The inventive and wholly original sitcomMalcolm in the Middlehas been honored with a Peabody Award and Emmys for directing and writing, but if life was fair, it would have earned an Emmy for Best Comedy Series, not to mention statuettes for its pitch-perfect cast. With his perpetual \"yes, me worry\" expression, Frankie Muniz instantly earns audience empathy as Malcolm, whose chances for a normal life are thwarted not only by his genius IQ (as discovered in the pilot episode), but also by his outrageously dysfunctional family: Lois (Jane Kaczmarek), his obsessive, control-freak mother; Hal (Bryan Cranston), his loving but ineffectual father; Francis (Christopher Masterson), his eldest brother waging his own private war at military school; middle brother Reese (Justin Berfield), a delinquent savant; and Dewey (Erik Per Sullivan), the put-upon youngest. As Malcolm observes at one point, \"This family may be rude, loud and gross, and have no shame whatsoever, but with them you know where you stand.\"This three-disc set contains all 16 episodes from the irreverently funny first season. The series instantly toned things down a tad from the pilot episode that saw Lois body-shaving a naked hirsute Hal in the kitchen. But it brilliantly sustains its subversive tone, from episode two, in which the brothers stand united against Lois's increasingly desperate methods to uncover who burned her red dress, to the season finale, in which Malcolm dares to push her down a water slide.

{"description": "Lesser-known among silent German classics,Waxworksis a carnival of a movie inviting you to visit three distinct freak shows and sample the thrills and peculiarities each has to offer. A young poet (Wilhelm Dieterle, who became Hollywood director William Dieterle) is hired to pen \"startling tales\" about three figures on display in theWachsfigurenkabinett. Somehow he and his boss's daughter (Olga Belajeff) win plum roles in each fantasia he concocts. The Arabian Nights episode, featuring Emil Jannings hamming it up as Caliph Haroun al-Raschid, boasts demented architecture and a blend of comedy and surrealism that inspired Douglas Fairbanks'sThief of Bagdad. Conrad Veidt, making a memorably mad Russian icon of Ivan the Terrible, towers amid episode 2's fiercely angular compositions. Then, still-unnerving double-exposure cinematography is used to bring \"Spring Heel Jack\" (Werner Krauss's version of Jack the Ripper) out of the realm of fantasy and menacingly into the real-world framing story.

{"description": "The duke of York, nicknamed Bertie, was born as royal 'spare heir', younger brother to the prince of Wales, and thus expected to spend a relatively private life with his Scottish wife Elisabeth Bowes-Lyon and their daughters, in the shadow of their reigning father, George V, and next that of his elder brother who succeeded to the British throne as Edward VIII. However Edward decides to put his love for a divorced American, Wallis Simpson, above dynastic duty, and ends up abdicating the throne, which now falls to Bertie, who reigns as George VI. Now he expects to be, as constitutional monarch, little more then a figure head, but again faith has more in store for him: Nazi Germany proves such a formidable war challenger to the British Empire that the nearly desperate nation looks to its royal couple as comforting symbol of the unbroken spirit, a part they play with great success, while hosting chased monarchs and governments from continental Europe. After victory, life returns to normal, but pulmonary disease soon ends George's, leaving the throne to his still young firstborn, queen Elisabeth II. \n\n16:9 Anamorphic Wide Screen\nEnglish\nEnglish\nRegion 2\nDolby Digital Stereo English\nDolby Digital Stereo", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0054DPLUC", "B000NTM9ZW", "B00005O7N8", "B00015HXDG", "B001B1Q2UO", "B004XYOQU4", "B001C4AFOY", "B000EOTELI", "B00BHO0STG", "B00BXTH44C", "B0059XTV4Y", "0767827775", "B0056C1M2M", "B000EMGF2Q", "B000EHQUGC", "B000JLTS80", "B000RF7XYY", "B000A8AXXG", "B0001KL5M6", "B003UESJH4", "B004SIP98S", "B007I6LHN8", "B000Z8H0IC", "B003AND1SM", "B009L2EW5W", "B005DVIQ2K", "B00005JLJP", "B007TBJD1K", "B005B1A0VM", "B000ND91S6", "B001L57ZZG", "B00GM7STPI", "B0080QOL10", "B000BKDNX0", "B00GJT2OWS", "B007HW8U2Y", "B004JMSIQS", "B000GH3CQG", "B004XC5LQE", "B00342ANSA", "B00005AUJT", "B007A2O3FO", "B004GJYRLY", "B0000AQS3P", "B00BQXTDIU", "B003WEAVZU", "B001AZIRVI", "B002CWKTUA", "B00IK481FO", "B00336M8DK", "B003WEAVZK", "B000BITVAG", "B00GPWEPZ8", "B000E8QV74", "B0012IV3Q4", "B008UQUS26", "B00062IZ0Y", "B0046ZYEUW", "B000FL7C9G", "B005RJ6A5S", "B000V02CO6", "B00005JOA0", "B00J44G7H8", "B000E0ODZE", "B00HUAH14Q", "B000784WNQ", "B0013NAMLK", "B00A4E8E78", "B00F1BFRA6", "B0059XTUVI", "B003WEAW04", "B000G6BM0K", "B000RF7XYO", "B005VUTRGW", "B00IT3KP96", "B000M2E32M", "B000089QEM", "B000ZOXDFA", "B0099Y2MYK", "B004H1UAIA", "B007701RFS", "B00C888NRO", "0767812115", "0688035531", "B00DW5ILF6", "B00CIUGD8S", "B000TLTCPY", "B005S9EJ14", "B0059XTV7Q", "B00DL48BM6", "B00CLH0C1M", "B000GIXLUC", "B00JX3SHIC", "B00EF0NVGQ", "B00IKM5OTW", "0671218107", "B004FM2EL2", "B009T6CXG0", "B0090XUARQ", "B000EBD9VC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00015HXDG", "B001C4AFOY", "B00005O7N8", "B001B1Q2UO"]}, "price": 10.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 686382}, "asin": "B00006JY7C", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51W4HHEBERL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bertie and Elizabeth"}
{"description": "Dirk Bogarde risked his career to make this 1962 film about a lawyer who risks his career to stand up to blackmailers. Part crime thriller and part plea for tolerance,Victimuses the terror of a blackmailing ring to point out the injustice of Britain's antisodomy laws. Bogarde plays Melville Farr, a married lawyer who learns of a blackmail scheme when one of its victims, an old friend, commits suicide rather than tell the police. As Farr conducts an investigation, he must confront his own past.Victimwas ahead of its time--it was the first English-language movie to use the word \"homosexual\"--and as such it seems quaint and stilted at times. Straw-man clich&#xE9;s about homosexuality must be knocked down, and, like in all first-wave issue movies, occasionally characters need to have rather stilted debates. Still, the crime plot stands on its own, the performances are excellent, and the film is brave enough to make some very good points. This is an interesting and worthy bit of cinematic history.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0032DNXMO", "B003VA3JTK", "B0006GAOOA", "B004LUKI9I", "B001CQONPE", "B0000WN10O", "B0007TKNGK", "B004CZZZJA", "B00005R24N", "6305779619", "B00AEBBA7W", "B001D8W7EU", "B00E849QSG", "B001FQHQL4", "B004RBC5JW", "B0007TKNHO", "B00004TWZH", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B004C2523M", "B00134SU2C", "B00008G5P7", "B00005JO5L", "B00004XPPK", "B0083HXKAY", "B00009Y3NL", "0780022823", "B008NNSDSC", "B00008LDNZ", "B0024FAG8A", "B00006L92W", "B005YCEIKM", "B00EKGXA84", "B00005R24A", "B00561BND6", "B000PE0EXE", "B0002CH7VQ", "B003156IHK", "B00006L93Q", "B000092T4S", "B000H5TUWM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003VA3JTK", "B0000WN10O", "B0047P5FTK", "B0032DNXMO"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 207015}, "asin": "B00007ELDE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41AV9W-6HZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Victim"}

{"description": "One of the Great Lives gets the full-scale miniseries treatment in this lavish international co-production (which aired on A&E;). Even at a six-hour running time, there's barely room for all the extraordinary twists and turns of Napoleon Bonaparte's turbulent career as Emperor of France, from his brilliant early military victories after the Revolution to his megalomaniacal attempts to reign over all of Europe. While there are battle scenes galore, and court ceremonies staged with eye-popping pomp and circumstance, this production keeps returning to the intent, watchful face of Christian Clavier's Napoleon. The hawk-eyed, pint-sized actor appears born to play the role, and he draws out the humanity within the icon. Clavier dominates the film, although Isabella Rossellini's Josephine is heartfelt enough to convince you of the passion between these two, which later turned into a kind of pragmatic contract. (Hard to keep your love life straight when you're trying to rule the world.) John Malkovich, in his exquisite-decadent mode, provides amoral political advice as Talleyrand.Napoleonhas the usual problems of international moviemaking, including the toneless line readings of supporting actors and the patchwork of accents. And it must move from A to B to C in predictable fashion, the curse of the historical biography. Abel Gance's silent epicNapoleonremains the cinematic standard for this life, but A&E;'s version gives a satisfying dramatic overview.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000GG4Y5A", "B0007GP836", "B000EMGF2Q", "B000EHQUGC", "B0066E6R4M", "B000E1E2N6", "B000GH3CQG", "B000MV90B2", "B000QGE86K", "0767827775", "B0000B1A58", "B0001KL5M6", "B000096FU4", "B000FII2PW", "B0007Z0ODG", "B0000524FG", "B004G8N9VO", "B000NO2416", "B000V02CO6", "B00004W5SS", "B004XC5LQE", "B00007GZYC", "B000EOTELI", "B003EQN62Q", "B00GJT2OWS", "B004QDRW0S", "B000BB1520", "B000NJL4QC", "B00078XGP6", "B000PGTNFM", "B00E1LT41K", "B00004U2K1", "B00CLH08KC", "B001B1Q2UO", "B00007CVRF", "B0012IV3Q4", "B0054DPLUC", "B002JUFPFY", "B00005QAQI", "B000EOTUSA", "B001FZQOOU", "B000EMG99U", "B003AND1SM", "B005DKS1TE", "5489003219", "B000H5U5UI", "B002NN7ETC", "B0054DPLRU", "B000BFJM26", "B000BKDNX0", "B00015HXDG", "B000ICLRDO", "B0095ZIHZ6", "B00000JYWU", "B00AY9V3A8", "1849086486", "B002AMUDJY", "B00FRQ0NYU", "B004Z2ECX0", "B000RF7XYO", "B000CSTK7O", "B0006Q93H4", "B00028G75C", "B000RXZIQQ", "B0007KIFUA", "B00BQXTDIU", "B000ANVQ6Y", "B003WEAVZU", "B000MGB6NM", "B0046YK4KW", "B007K7IB9I", "B002CWKTUA", "B000FL7C9G", "B002WBYDR6", "B0060MYK7G", "B004G9UXB2", "B00BXTH44C", "B002LFPBJW", "B000KJTG0G", "B009XTF8NI", "B0028RXXE8", "B001OLP2TI", "B004VK74A4", "B004MCGNVM", "B000LV6OJE", "B000TXNDT8", "B000Z8H0IC", "B000GG4Y32", "B000TLTCPY", "B006JY3OHW", "B000ZOXDFA", "B00E1LSJIO", "1780961022", "B00A4E8E78", "B000M06KJ8", "B00005YUO1", "B009TT0BSE", "B000JLTS80", "B0002CH90K"], "bought_together": ["B000GG4Y5A", "B0007GP836"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000GG4Y5A", "B0066E6R4M", "B000E1E2N6", "B001E77XN0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 99579}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 96.98, "brand": "A&amp;E", "asin": "B00008IOWU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412PVESRC9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Napoleon (TV Miniseries) (3-Disc Collector's Edition)"}

{"description": "Kate Hudson twinkles as the heroine of How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days. She's a magazine writer assigned to date a guy, make all the mistakes girls make that drive guys away (being clingy, talking in baby-talk and so on) and records the process like a sociological experiment. However, the guy she picks-- Matthew McConaughey--is an advertising executive who's just bet that he can make a woman fall in love with him in 10 days; if he succeeds, he'll win a huge account that will make his career. The set-up is completely absurd, but the collision of their efforts to woo and repel creates some pretty funny scenes. McConaughey's easy charm and Hudson's lightweight impishness play well together and the plot, though strictly Hollywood formula, chugs along efficiently. At moments Hudson seems to channel her mother, Goldie Hawn, to slightly unnerving effect. --Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00007E2F5", "B00003CXSM", "B00AEFXWXI", "B0012KJ0DK", "B002K0WBXW", "B0015I2RT8", "B00164KYV4", "B004EPZ070", "B0000897EG", "B00447L4KA", "B002P413IC", "B00005JN3W", "B002ZG988M", "B000MQC9H4", "B002ZG989G", "B00AEBB8NS", "B000A343RI", "B001TUZD8O", "B00006ZXSL", "B00005O5CM", "B001OQCUZM", "B004EPZ0BG", "B00081U7HC", "B004SIP9X8", "B003Y5H574", "B001Y8DJVE", "6304765266", "B00008NRI7", "B000YDBPAM", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00AEBB8R4", "B00AEFYQE2", "B000683VI4", "B0000524E5", "B00AEBB9WI", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B00AEFYM2S", "B000YAA68C", "B00AMEZDJW", "B0007PLLBU", "B00006ZXSK", "B002ZG984Q", "B0009OL7Z4", "B002ZG9968", "B0036TGSIK", "B000023VTP", "B003BV8ICC", "B00AEFYWQY", "B00AEBB8YW", "B000J4QW7W", "B003B3V0N4", "B00005JG6N", "B0000DIXDR", "B004SEUJK0", "B005LAIGSM", "B000ELJAEM", "B0001Z3TXE", "B000957O82", "B001OQCUYI", "B004SIP9RO", "B004SIP8LG", "B003NHRIVQ", "B0013D8LHC", "B00AKGG6JS", "B00008WJD6", "B003Y5H524", "B000J103OI", "B0050MB584", "B00006ZXSO", "B00006FMUW", "B000HEWEE4", "6305236569", "B000XJD33O", "B002ZG99UE", "B0035Q637K", "B00466HN7M", "B001L9EXTS", "B00386EZKE", "B001C5LLQ4", "076780421X", "B000J3OTSM", "B000E6EHE0", "B004LWZW9C", "B00005JM55", "B000EMGICS", "B000CEV3KU", "B008JFUUIA", "B00003CXMP", "B000P0J0DS", "B000TZJBPQ", "B0000AOV4I", "B005Z9MFRC", "B0000D8L1K", "B000HCPS94", "B00E8RKHWW", "B00AEFY4CG", "B004SIP8JI", "B0001AVZA8", "B005LAIGXW", "B000Y7U93C"], "bought_together": ["B00007E2F5", "B002K0WBXW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002K0WBXW", "B002ZG989G", "B00007E2F5", "B00447L4KA"]}, "price": 14.16, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 346003}, "asin": "B00008KDGZ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512083xZEbL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"}

{"description": "Depending on how you liked this romantic comedy, you just might find more laughs in the delightful banter between the director and his two stars on the commentary track. Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant join writer-director Marc Lawrence for a lively 102 minutes of conversation. Not much movie magic is discussed, but the three talents will sacrifice all for a good joke. It's best to watch the commentary track with the \"Two Bleeps Notice\" viewing option: when a heart appears on-screen, you can immediately view outtakes from that stage of the film. The flubs, on-set antics, and jokes are all guaranteed to bring a laugh. Other extras include two additional scenes (the wedding finale was judicially cut) and a HBO puff-piece on the making of the film.

{"description": "As the sole movie co-starring Hollywood's only First Couple, Ronald Reagan and Nancy Davis,Hellcats of the Navyis either a privileged artifact or a hootworthy campfest, depending on your politics.  Reagan plays a submarine (\"hellcat\") commander in the Pacific during World War II; Davis is the game little nurse back on shore who's decided he's (this is a quote) \"Mr. Right.\"  They share maybe eight minutes among the film's 82.  Reagan's commander is a pretty glum guy, making unpopular life-or-death decisions into which his executive officer (Arthur Franz) reads nasty personal motives.  This is a B movie all the way: drab supporting cast, script and direction that can't even get the cliches right, and bland studio footage of the actors intercut with speckly stock action shots and blatant miniatures exploding.  Any contemporaneous episode of the syndicated TV seriesThe Silent Servicegot more sense of excitement and wartime pressure aboard a submarine.

{"description": "The tremendous charisma of Chow Yun-fat anchors this entertaining comic-book romp.Bulletproof Monkcenters around a monk with no name (Chow) dedicated to protecting a sacred scroll that can give world-manipulating power to anyone who reads it. A hidden Nazi has been pursuing the scroll for 60 years and has finally caught up with the monk in present-day New York City; meanwhile, the monk suspects he may have found a disciple in a petty thief (Seann William Scott,Dude, Where's My Car?,American Pie) who's learned kung fu from watching double-feature chopsocky flicks. Don't let the presence of Chow Yun-fat lead you to expect much substance--this doesn't have the emotional scope ofCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragonor the visual panache ofHard-Boiled.

{"description": "Harrison Ford lends his solid, perpetually disgruntled presence toHollywood Homicide, an action comedy in which he's paired with the squinty eyes and peaches-and-cream complexion of Josh Hartnett (Black Hawk Down,O). Radical French filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard would appreciate this complete deconstruction of the buddy-cop flick genre; basic cinematic elements (mismatched partners, a hard-ass superior riding them, arguments about who's going to drive, arguments about intuition vs. diligent detective work, the bad cop who killed Hartnett's father, etc.) have been scrambled and slapped together with no concern for coherence, making clear their innately artificial nature. Sex scenes and car chases come out of nowhere and disappear without consequence, providing arbitrary visual stimulus. During shootouts, it's impossible to tell who got killed or why, underscoring a basic doubt about the purpose of making movies likeHollywood Homicide. It's rare for a mainstream movie to be so daringly (if perhaps accidentally) avant-garde.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000F8DV1M", "B001DJLD08", "B00AEFYXJ0", "B001UDS4BS", "B00AEFYENK", "6305213283", "B00AEBB9UK", "B00AEBBA2W", "B00441GYZQ", "B00096S4DK", "B00005LB88", "6305133476", "0792844017", "0767803434", "B00AEFYW64", "B002ZG98FU", "B000K2UVZM", "B0045HCJ8K", "B0045HCJFS", "B000FKO5QK", "0767821513", "B00067BBMS", "B00AEBB9NM", "B002ZG97J2", "B00008EYA5", "B00005JLX2", "B000085EF5", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00008EY9G", "B004SEUJ9Q", "B004P7CN7W", "B000BYA4J2", "B0015OKWL2", "B004EPYZSK", "B002AT8K9W", "B0007IO6NM", "0767802578", "B001NY4WYC", "6304698747", "0790732149", "B00008K76V", "B00009MEKO", "B00005UQ9T", "B004EPYZT4", "0767818024", "B003LR5BD0", "B003A12WBQ", "0790731460", "6305263248", "B00004WG2F", "B000P0J06U", "B0087DFIYA", "B00008OE4W", "B000MGBLTQ", "B0034G4ORC", "B0019EXZY4", "6305133468", "B0000AZT79", "B0000B1OFL", "B002ZG96ZC", "B001OST0LW", "B000OYAT3U", "B00005R5GM", "B000LC3ICE", "B00E1HIWXU", "B00260HH2G", "B00BTYOYG2", "B001UV4XGA", "B0000A9GHD", "B003AWRM9W", "B004P7CMVE", "B000EHSVOG", "B00005N5S5", "B000XT1P4S", "B000069DOB", "B001BGS17Q", "B003Q6D2B4", "B001GMAVGE", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B00AEFXT1S", "B001VLBDD0", "B004A8ZWSS", "B000YDMPC4", "0792844874", "B001GKJ2E8", "B00AEBB9UU", "B000JYW5BE", "B000XJD34I", "B008CRB1HY", "B008JFURII", "B002AS464Q", "B0001Z37HM", "B000BFH2C8", "B00008K76W", "B000P0J08S", "0783229364", "B001SN78JO", "B00AEBB95K", "B00BUAEYVK", "B0045HCJ8A"], "bought_together": ["6305213283"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AU740H2", "B001UDS4BS", "B001DJLD08", "B00005LB88"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 45508}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.0, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B0000B00KB", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XVMJ3CPGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hollywood Homicide"}
{"description": "Though it bears little resemblance to the original 1969 thriller starring Michael Caine, the 2003 remake ofThe Italian Jobstands on its own as a caper comedy that's well above average. The title's a misnomer--this time it's actually a Los Angeles job--but the action's just as exciting as it propels a breezy tale of honor and dishonor among competing thieves. Inheriting Caine's role as ace heist-planner Charlie Croker, Mark Wahlberg plays straight-man to a well-cast team of accomplices, including Mos Def, Jason Statham, and scene-stealer Seth Green in a variation of the role originally played by Noel Coward. As the daughter of Croker's ill-fated mentor (Donald Sutherland), Charlize Theron is recruited to double-cross a double-crosser (Edward Norton in oily villain mode), and once again, speedily versatile Mini Coopers play a pivotal role in director F. Gary Gray's exhilarating car-chase climax. It's perhaps the greatest product placement in movie history, and just as fun the second time around.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB86A", "B00AEFY0XE", "B0000AUHPB", "B0019EXZY4", "B00004Z4WR", "B005LAIGLE", "B001MTYRKC", "B000ZS8GWQ", "B000J3OTT6", "B00AEBB8LA", "B000P0J0BK", "B00BB67UNW", "B004HO6HWA", "B004P7CMVE", "0767818024", "B004ULNJIU", "B003Q6D2B4", "B001F12J0C", "B001QB9H10", "B004EPYZP8", "B008E70EES", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B0062P3392", "B001TODCII", "B002GSXKP6", "B000BTITKS", "B0010YVCB6", "B000K7UBSO", "078322933X", "B001ILHY1I", "B0007P0XBO", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B003UESJHO", "B000AP04FG", "B0002ZDVEU", "B000JYW5BE", "B000W1V5VU", "B00008AOVL", "B00005JLIF", "B000093FLA", "6305657947", "6304711891", "B003L20IG0", "B00DU22OI6", "B005LAIGRS", "B008JFURII", "B002XMGGK6", "B002DU39GW", "B00HEPC0TS", "B005LAIILM", "B000P0J0C4", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000W9DTG6", "B000M341QE", "B002NZK5UU", "B000X1Z0C4", "B00AEFZ2DG", "B000FKO5QK", "B001UV4XGA", "B00023B1LC", "B000GFLKF8", "B00005JLSB", "B000ENC5YW", "B00AEFY5B6", "B001J710Z2", "B002ZG99H2", "B000VWYJ86", "B00005JN0T", "B002ZG999U", "6305428115", "B00000JGNP", "B00140PK82", "B002ZG9864", "B002GIBVVQ", "B004H83IFK", "B00BEIYLO8", "B00005UQ9T", "6304806434", "0783240295", "B005LAIGXW", "B00003CY0V", "B000KF0GWW", "B000P0J0EW", "B00005JLX2", "B002VECM6S", "B002ZG97RE", "B002O3Z4XY", "B000E5N684", "B002ZG980U", "B00005B6JZ", "B001N44BVQ", "B000FKO3WG", "B00005JKBC", "B007REV4T8", "B00E8RKHWW", "B001DZOC6Y", "B0012KJ0DK", "B002GHHHP6", "B00005JN0W", "B00AQSN7HE"], "bought_together": ["B00AEBB86A", "B00AEFY0XE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000AUHPB", "B00AEBB86A", "B00004Z4WR", "B005LAIIHG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8732}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "Paramount", "asin": "B0000B1OFL", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X762iDLcL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Italian Job"}

{"description": "Spanning two decades and countless light years of interstellar adventure,Star Trek: The Motion Pictures Collectionis a testament to the enduring goodwill of Gene Roddenberry's optimistic sci-fi concept. Long beforeStar Warssparked an explosion of big-screen science fiction, Roddenberry had planned a secondStar TrekTV series; the project fizzled, but its pilot script evolved into the first film in Paramount's most lucrative movie franchise. Despite its sluggish pace and bland \"pajama\" costuming,Star Trek: The Motion Picture(1979) offered a welcomed reunion of the \"ClassicTrek\" cast, packed with Douglas Trumbull's still-dazzling special effects. Trekkers were even more ecstatic whenThe Wrath of Khan(1982) revived the spirit of the original series, even though director Nicholas Meyer was aTrekneophyte. With Leonard Nimoy directing,The Search for Spock(1984) began whereKhanleft off, with a thrilling (albeit contrived) obligation to resurrect the formerly ill-fated Mr. Spock.A box-office smash, Nimoy'sThe Voyage Home(1986)  is the franchise's most accessible adventure--a high point offset by William Shatner's comparatively dreadfulStar Trek V: The Final Frontier(1989). Meyer (and his penchant for quoting Shakespeare) returned forThe Undiscovered Country(1991), a conspiracy thriller that put the series back on track, inspiring fans to invoke the \"even number\" rule in rating their franchise favorites.Generations(1994) gracefully passed the torch to TV'sThe Next Generation, bidding farewell to Captain Kirk with honor and integrity intact. Highlighted by the evolving humanity of Brent Spiner's android Lt. Cmdr. Data,First Contact(1996) exploredStar Trekhistory with a logical (hint) surprise encounter, andInsurrection(1998) provided an adequate expansion of the successfulNextGenseries. Taken as a whole, these ten films demonstrate the consistent vitality of Roddenberry's original vision, stoking any Trekker's appetite for \"ongoing missions\" inNemesisand beyond.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002HWRYJE", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001DHXT6G", "B000AOEMXM", "B000HEWEJ4", "B000RZIGVS", "B00062RCC6", "B001DHXT3Y", "B00062IDDS", "B008JFUS0U", "1613778953", "B00000ILDH", "B002GSXKN8", "B000VDDDY6", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B008JFUNHI", "B00005JKHP", "B00CTSDDVO", "B00F3L8P26", "B00JL6L4WC", "B001E75QH0", "B002945DU2", "B00BTYMPUY", "B000P6XQ50", "B0077T5SWC", "B002I9Z8I0", "6305181721", "B0017VG69U", "B002EL4RLQ", "B0000UJL96", "B001TH16CE", "B0001O3YA8", "6305428263", "B00BEZTMFY", "B000E6ESEY", "B000H6SXW4", "B005BUA1JY", "B000286RR0", "B002MU4NM2", "B00E5G03I4", "B00GX7D5G0", "B001DJLD1M", "B005SH62X4", "B002PQ7JQK", "B002A6FIXG", "B001CQONOA", "B008JFUPFI", "B00DYEN6XC", "B00061QJSK", "B009WH5KC0", "B009LDD4V4", "B000VXWK86", "B000WC3864", "B001TH16CO", "B000REQQGQ", "B000063V8R", "B002I9Z8GM", "B000M341R8", "B000ASDFH2", "B002U0KHME", "B000CEXFYW", "B005J9ZFQG", "B008JFUO72", "B004XM38CS", "B00BMJ7ZKG", "B00A3717C0", "B0054OGQM8", "B005BYBZKY", "B00006BH8G", "B00HERGM86", "B000BW7QWW", "B002I9Z8EO", "B0083SBMBM", "B00005Y1NF", "B006U1JD5G", "B007ZFR67I", "B00471JSRE", "B001XW7ICW", "B00A8MGIZG", "B008JFUQZ2", "B000JLTRHW", "B000PHX8RA", "B008412UQ4", "B0000AQS0F", "B00C6ACVD6", "B00EC9UHVM", "B00D2D1WVI", "B00DY9528Y", "B008HUSFTS", "B000U1ZV62", "B008DVJNTW", "B000P0J0A6", "B00DJYJWVW", "B007REV4T8", "B008JFURII", "B001EXE2Y2", "B001TH16DS", "B007KFZ85K", "B002HRF68A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002I9Z8I0", "B002I9Z8GM", "B001DHXT6G", "B00AZMFJYA"]}, "price": 69.5, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 227123}, "asin": "B0000CABK8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K147X2XGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Star Trek - The Motion Pictures Collection (10 Films)"}
{"description": "The sixth season ofBuffy the Vampire Slayerfollowed the logic of plot and character development into some gloomy places. The year begins with Buffy being raised from the dead by the friends who miss her, but who fail to understand that a sacrifice taken back is a sacrifice negated. Dragged out of what she believes to have been heavenly bliss, she finds herself \"going through the motions\" and entering into a relationship with the evil, besotted vampire Spike just to force her emotions.  Willow becomes ever more caught up in the temptations of magic; Xander and Anya move towards marriage without ever discussing their reservations; Giles feels he is standing in the way of Buffy's adult independence; Dawn feels neglected. What none of them need is a menace that is, at this point, simply annoying--three high school contemporaries who have turned their hand to magical and high-tech villainy. Added to this is a hungry ghost, an invisibility ray, an amnesia spell and a song-and-dance demon (who acts as rationale for the incomparable musical episode \"Once More, with Feeling\").This is a year in which chickens come home to roost: everything from the villainy of the three geeks to Xander's doubts about marriage come to a head, often--as in the case of the impressive wedding episode--through wildly dark humor. The estrangement of the characters from each other--a well-observed portrait of what happens to college pals in their early 20s--comes to a shocking head with the death of a major character and that death's apocalyptic consequences. The series ends on a consoling note which it has, by that point and in spite of imperfections, entirely earned.--Roz Kaveney", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EHSVN2", "B000EHSVM8", "B000EHSVLY", "B000EHSVLE", "B000EHSVL4", "B000EHSVKK", "B000I0QLRI", "B000I0QLRS", "B000I0QLS2", "B000I0QLQY", "B000I0QLR8", "B007H9CNOI", "B000HD1482", "B003YF9Q08", "1593078226", "B00006J3WH", "B0006IUE16", "B0009W5J4Q", "B002JVWR4U", "B000ERVJM2", "B000GG4Y6O", "B000JLTRIG", "B000CCBCGM", "1595825584", "1595826106", "B000B5XOW0", "B00001R3O1", "B0024FAR66", "B001FB4W0C", "B00AMDA2QC", "1595821651", "B005CM1IIE", "B000OIOPHC", "B006LG74Q0", "B00JF5G8WU", "159307963X", "B00344EAQO", "B0000AQS0F", "B00466H3CW", "B002U8XW9Q", "B000X5SPBI", "1595824154", "B000BOH990", "B000BOH98G", "1595823425", "B00133QNSG", "B003R4ZMN6", "B00511N79O", "B000O77SN6", "B008EVT42W", "B000BOH986", "B000CNE0SS", "B009LDCXNY", "B0002XVKMM", "B000RO6JYK", "B00076ONT6", "B009LDCWWG", "B00IWTVDUW", "B000FP2OPY", "B006LG74RE", "B000R7GKQE", "B0010YSD7M", "B00243FQFA", "B000O77SMW", "1442412097", "B003R0MF7G", "B002JVWRAO", "B009LDD4V4", "B001MVWRNO", "B001AQO43M", "0789326302", "B000JW1TYU", "B000AO9BSS", "1595823107", "B004YM6JLO", "B0000C9JFQ", "B0006J28E6", "B001RXDM2C", "B000EXDS3E", "B005PPMHO2", "B00466H3CC", "B0058YPGL6", "B00133QNS6", "B00006FD9N", "B001992NWO", "B0001O3YLM", "1595829229", "B00A8KJN8M", "B003L77GAQ", "B00133QNRW", "B00005JNOG", "B001MVWRNE", "B00AMDA2P8", "B00HEQOAIQ", "B000G1R4TS", "B0077PTWHI", "B001QE99AQ", "B000EXDS34", "B00344EAKA", "B001M5UDGS"], "bought_together": ["B000EHSVN2", "B000EHSVM8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EHSVM8", "B000EHSVLY", "B0046XG48O", "B000EHSVLE"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 112363}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 34.59, "brand": "", "asin": "B0000DANYD", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417707V8Z5L._SX300_.jpg", "title": "Buffy The Vampire Slayer - The Complete Sixth Season"}

{"description": "Lots happened behind the scenes between seasons and early on in the seventh year ofFriends, leaving audiences speculating this might be the last. Matthew Perry became seriously ill again, and returned looking more emaciated than ever. Courtney Cox regained weight, but despite finishingScream 3happily, things were already rocky with David Arquette. Much was made in the press about Aniston marrying Brad Pitt, of course, but the real news (allaying fans' fears) was NBC's expensive renewal of the cast for two years at $750,000 per episode each (more than six times their previous increase). On-screen, at least there was Chandler and Monica's engagement lasting the whole year, despite predictable ups and downs (e.g., \"The One with the Truth About London\" revealing that Monica fancied Joey). By the time we finally get to \"The One with Chandler's Dad\" (Kathleen Turner!), it seems inevitable that the two-part finale will be an insane mess--but with a happy-ish ending. Sure enough, \"The One with Monica and Chandler's Wedding\" features Gary Oldman joining in the chaos as Chandler repeatedly goes missing.Other star turns in the year wereSeinfeld's Jason Alexander as a suicidal office manager, Susan Sarandon as soap queen bitch Jessica Lockhart, Denise Richards as one of Ross and Monica's endless number of cousins, and Winona Ryder as a surprise old friend, prompting \"The One with Rachel's Big Kiss.\" But perhaps the most telling installment of this weirdly atmospheric year was \"The One Where They All Turn Thirty.\" It suggested that maybe the Friends were all getting too old to carry on living their frivolous lives the same way after all.--Paul Tonks", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003TNW030", "B003TNW03K", "B0006ZM8M2", "B0000C2IXN", "B003TNW03A", "B003TNW04Y", "B0000844MI", "B000068CNX", "B003TNW02G", "B005IA9JRM", "B005MG8UNG", "B005IA9JSG", "B005IA9JQ8", "B00020HAWY", "B005IA9JVI", "B00B1LKXPY", "B000HT3P7E", "B0009WFEEG", "B008LCRABQ", "B008LCRA98", "B000TM1CKQ", "B0002I84FS", "B005SJGIV8", "B008L0YMZA", "B008LCRAC0", "B000T22PVG", "B000GRUMQY", "B0001907BW", "B000A7PKGW", "B002BJGYU8", "B001TKJDNA", "B000G1R3A8", "B000RGULLA", "B004GJYRFA", "B0058JEHTS", "B0010X5X4O", "B000W91RUG", "B001PQZYQI", "B000HT3P6U", "B0024FAR6Q", "B000J4QW7W", "B002N5N4FS", "B000NOKFH6", "B002BJGYV2", "B0007R4SWC", "B0044LYRFA", "B008LCRAFC", "B003CN5SAY", "B00GUOJJUW", "B0019CSXAM", "B00005JM3A", "B000EHSVN2", "B000OHZKZ4", "B002BJGYTY", "B00029RTCG", "B001RXDM2C", "B000ERVK5S", "B003L77G6A", "B00005JOHC", "B0001CCXZW", "B008FTWT7K", "B000NA78SE", "B004GJYRA0", "B0090SI53C", "B000J3OTSM", "B001992NWO", "B000HT3P60", "B004EPZ0BG", "B00005AVCA", "B00G3XHH68", "B003TFAJ18", "B000EHSVMS", "B00BEIYMZ6", "B000NA2BEU", "0767827686", "B002N5N5NE", "B000EHSVLE", "B005Z9MFRC", "B008X6N8KW", "B00009Y3RW", "B009LDD1X0"], "bought_together": ["B003TNW030", "B003TNW03K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005IA9JQI", "B003TNW030", "B003TNW04Y", "B005IA9JRM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12450}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 15.98, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B0001AW066", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SyXqeC-bL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Friends: Season 7"}
{"description": "As upscale sitcoms go,Something's Gotta Givehas more to offer than most romantic comedies. Obviously working through some semi-autobiographical issues regarding \"women of a certain age,\" writer-director Nancy Meyers brings adequate credibility and above-average intelligence to what is essentially (but not exclusively) a fantasy premise, in which an aging lothario who's always dated younger women (Jack Nicholson, more or less playing himself) falls for a successful middle-aged playwright (Diane Keaton) who's convinced she's past the age of romance, much less sexual re-awakening. As long as old pals Nicholson and Keaton are on screen discussing their dilemma or discovering their mutual desire,Something's Gotta Giveis terrific, proving (in case anyone had forgotten) that Hollywood can and should aim for an older demographic. Myers falls short with the sitcom device of a younger lover (Keanu Reeves) who wants Keaton as much as Nicholson does; it's believable but shallow and too easily dismissed. Myers also skimps on supporting roles for Frances McDormand, Amanda Peet, and Jon Favreau, but thankfully this is one romantic comedy that doesn't pander to youth.

Vignettes on flying, casting, computer effects, characters, or simple behind-the-scenes footage are just some of various segments contained in five \"worlds.\" Be sure to \"Visit the Darling House\" to find a deleted scene and an alternate ending (which has the original book's ending of Pan returning). \"Board the Pirate Ship\" to see Jason Isaacs's (Capt. Hook) cute \"home movies\" from the set and a cut pirate song. The longest segment (12 minutes) is a puffy promotional piece hosted by Sarah Ferguson that goes over everything lightly, including the history of the tale. Note: this film would be a perfect candidate to have both a pan-and-scan and widescreen presentation on the same disc.

{"description": "The world of high school gets a treatment both glamorous and terrifying in  the TV seriesPopular. The show spins around two characters: Blonde  cheerleader Brooke (Leslie Bibb) and brunette alterna-girl Sam (Carly  Pope), each the center of their social groups. To their mutual horror,  Brooke's divorced father and Sam's widowed mother fall in love, turning  these cultural opposites into stepsisters. The large supporting cast  includes overweight but determined Carmen (Sara Rue), conniving  Lady-Macbeth-with-pom-poms Nicole (Tammy Lynn Michaels), earnest jock Josh  (Bryce Johnson), all-encompassing activist Lily (Tamara Mello), frustrated  sensitive boy Harrison (Christopher Gorham), and many others. The key toPopularis how it merges melodramatic soap-opera stories with  wrenchingly blunt and honest portrayals of the cruelties of adolescence.While some viewers may find it galling to listen to a gorgeous young  actress who's been on magazine covers moan about how she can't be as  perfect as a model, the series tackles everything from anorexia to peer  manipulation to teen sex with directness and an eye for moral and  emotional complexity. An episode about a Sadie Hawkins dance becomes a  satirical farce about body image (femaleandmale); a slumber party  turns into brutal humiliation; a teacher decides to get a sex-change  operation, prompting anxiety throughout the school. Almost every character  gets a moment of heartfelt grandstanding, yet the actors pull them off  with commitment and guts (Rue routinely turns speeches that could have  been cheesy schlock into genuine pathos). Sure, some fantasy sequences are  silly, but the show skillfully creates characters and situations that defy  easy definition. Repeatedly, Brooke and Sam each set out with good  intentions, only to end up hurting their friends and fueling their  antagonistic relationship.Popularcunningly subverts expectations;  it's a smart show for both teenagers and adults.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006J28DW", "B000E33VYU", "B0009F43DG", "B0006J28E6", "B000FUTVPA", "B00092ZM7U", "B00KNAMMOY", "B00133QNSG", "B0001IN0T4", "B00133QNRW", "B003TJM5RK", "B000BNXD6O", "B0077PTWY6", "B0077PTWHI", "B00133QNS6", "B00BGQ2NIO", "B00127RAGM", "B0007TKHKC", "B000P6YNT8", "B003R0MF6W", "B004YM6JQO", "B00FPUN61U", "B00BGQ2NDO", "B00005JPII", "B001NPK5C4", "B001ULCY48", "B007MDB6RO", "B0033WH6MW", "B001UHOWYM", "B00DW5IL92", "B000LXH3SI", "B00GB0ORJ8", "B00FPUN57K", "B001L1S1SK", "B004GJYRFA", "B00CMVVCRU", "B0001EQHXO", "B001MVYUSO", "B000U1ZV2G", "B00CKJJ1G8", "B00BMKGZVA", "B0002I838Q", "B007W2MKFM", "B0018CWEXA", "B0030VANIU", "B000NA78SE", "B00DDHFKMA", "B000VZADPQ", "B007ZR9HP0", "B0053TWVQ4", "B008L0YMWS", "B00DRSGQ7I", "B0006GAO18", "B008I34YOO", "B00BBGZ17O", "B00005JNAF", "B00C5SE8F8", "B003L77GEM", "B003ES5JH4", "B000NA2BEU", "630529335X", "B00ECXJC28", "B002TQKL4S", "B00191AEYQ", "B002ZTQW3S", "B003F3NDOE", "B00GTZWZH6", "B000MGBLEQ", "B000FUTVV4", "B005UQQRBA", "B0024FAD7O", "B0000AKCJK", "B001JAHPZ8", "B000FL7CAK", "B00F1FVKVC", "B001FB5TAY", "B008JBJAM6", "B001GP5TMW", "B002AK9UOK", "B00E4Q6U9Q", "6305428425", "B00AJCOZVY", "B0056GLNQI", "B00BT1XCOU", "B0011UBDS6", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B00919TITU", "B00ED2IBXE", "B00FZ4KT84", "B003R4ZMJU", "B00002SSKI", "B007PKSO2Y", "B00369ERC4", "B0019N8P2W", "B001UREJXQ", "B000F6ZIIS", "B004HW7JI8", "B001ILFUAA", "B00BIR381W"], "bought_together": ["B0006J28DW", "B000E33VYU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000E33VYU", "B0006J28E6", "B0009F43DG", "B0006J28DW"]}, "price": 19.86, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 81292}, "asin": "B0001I55S8", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511V53JGTSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Popular: Season 1"}
{"description": "No actor works harder to open a movie than Tom Cruise. His enthusiasm is throughout the DVD extras as he mirrors his samurai character by constantly talking about \"loyalty\" and \"discipline\" while working on the film. However as a post-movie experience, the top-line extras with Cruise and director Edward Zwick are repetitive and underwhelming, with too many clips from the film we assume DVD viewers have just seen. The History Channel show is also a pre-release promotional device that misses an opportunity to really dig into this intriguing time period. Better are segments on the costumes, the production design, and how you put together an Imperial army--in New Zealand, no less. Zwick's low-key and dense commentary (plus a \"Video Journal\") is not vital, but he illustrates many of the little peculiarities it took to make the wide-ranging film come together. There are two deleted scenes; a samurai's first appearance is particularly memorable.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFY5B6", "B002O3Z50Q", "B00004XPPG", "B00AMSLDTM", "B0002YLCG0", "B0000DZTIW", "B000AARKOO", "B000QXDED6", "B003U0AHBO", "B00AEFXKUI", "B000A2WP7O", "B008MIMWOY", "B00AEBBA36", "B004AOECXI", "6305692688", "B000MGB6NM", "B0000TANUI", "079283366X", "B00005JL78", "B000W1SZBS", "B004SIP88Y", "B0034G4P58", "B001TUZG4K", "B00AS1Q93S", "B000MRA592", "B00001ZWUS", "B000E5N6LG", "B000XR9L50", "B0001HLVS2", "B00HEPDGKA", "B003ASLJO0", "B00AEBB9NM", "B000P0J0EW", "B0000A2ZNX", "B00005JNTI", "B0018QPPXW", "B000065U1N", "B000095WW8", "B0002WZTOI", "B002VWNIEA", "B004U7MQWY", "B002VWNID6", "B008JFUO36", "B00AEBB86A", "B00005JN0W", "B0007Q6VXC", "B001LRJH0U", "B000MZHW40", "B0002IQMAM", "B00004WG2F", "B003INBO3I", "B000EHRVMY", "B000NOKFHQ", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEFXVCU", "B000YENUI6", "B000M341QE", "B0000YEEGM", "B001680M26", "B008R65XYC", "B002ZG99QS", "B00008K76U", "B000HRMAPE", "B007TBKAXK", "B00000G3PA", "0767810856", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00AEFXYJA", "B002T9H2LA", "B000P0J0AG", "B00003CXZ1", "B000O599YO", "B000FS9FCG", "6304711905", "B00AEFXRRO", "B000HRMAUY", "B001ILHY1I", "B002NZK5V4", "B002VWNICC", "B000VKL6ZM", "B001UDS4BS", "B002ZG997C", "B004SIP8ZM", "0800177967", "B0001O3YD0", "B00005ATZT", "B004XFZ3UU", "B00004Z4WR", "B005LAIH2W", "B0007TKNGA", "B00000JQB5", "B0012Q732O", "B002ZG97RE", "B0002VEUV2", "0800141741", "B002ZG977Y", "B00005N5S3", "B00008G8M4", "B0000B1OFL"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFY5B6", "B00004XPPG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000QXDED6", "B00BEJL6JK", "B00AEFXXMI", "B00JU949TK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 121880}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 17.25, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001JXOUS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EdSWs9r9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Last Samurai (Full Screen Edition)"}

{"description": "The younger you are, the more you'll enjoy UPN's short-lived revival ofThe Twilight Zone. Front-loaded with young actors (or marginal celebrities, like Jessica Simpson) and a bone-jarring theme by Korn's Jonathan Davis, the show panders to a teen demographic, which original-series creator Rod Serling would never have tolerated. It's a pale copy ofSerling's original, and even the 1985TZrevival was marginally better, but there are some memorable exceptions in this 43-episode, six-disc set. Not surprisingly, the best episodes are straight remakes of (or sequels to) classic Serling originals, including \"The Monsters on Maple Street,\" \"It's Still a Good Life\" (with former child actor Bill Mumy reprising his creepiest role, and featuring a series-best performance by Cloris Leachman), and \"Eye of the Beholder.\" Of the originals to this series, highlights include the pilot episode with Jeremy Piven; Jason Alexander in \"One Night at Mercy,\" Amber Tamblyn in \"Evergreen\"; Lukas Haas in \"Harsh Mistress\"; Lou Diamond Phillips in \"The Pool Guy\";ER's Eriq La Salle as writer, director, and star of \"Memphis\"; and a few others that capture the eerie quality of \"another dimension of sight, sound, and mind.\"Woefully miscast as the series' host, Forest Whitaker delivers facile introductions devoid of Serling's literary finesse. More often than not, the writing relies on forgettable characters and thinly-disguised variations on original-series themes; at its worst, the series demonstrates a staggering lack of originality, and the youthful casting frequently results in one-dimensional performances, with a few notable exceptions. It's hit-or-miss at best, but shooting locations in Vancouver, British Columbia, lend the series a visually stimulating variety of settings and atmosphere; production values are consistently high (as they were in the Canadian seasons ofX-Files), and Rick Maguire deserves praise for his cinematography on virtually every episode. If you can forget Serling altogether (a difficult challenge for his devoted fans), you'll be able to overlook the flaws and enjoy some occasionally clever trips intoThe Twilight Zoneas it was meant to be.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00092ZLDK", "B00068NVLQ", "B00JKTFQJM", "B00005JOJE", "B0007CEXUY", "B003VJTGNE", "B00LT1JHLW", "B000B5IP4W", "B0002CX1M0", "B001DXS4DI", "B000H5U5EE", "B006TBYC76", "B00BQK4YDC", "B00005JN8Q", "B0002NRRRE", "B00KTZALDC", "B003BNO9GO", "B004E5BQDW", "B000Q8X1IE", "B000UYN9M2", "B00LMBURDG", "B00GSMZ3I8", "B00L9K2EGS", "B00013D54Y", "B001A7GOCA", "B00BI3XZA0", "B000BCKFXE", "B003NOGNQU", "B00LLAV26O", "B001HNDR4A", "B002EP8FDI", "B000OPOAKW", "B0007XG2YS", "B002HK9HZU", "B00GT4NCBU", "B007I8KXQ8", "B000GYI340", "B00C6F61S2", "B002FLOTPO", "B000FFJZO2", "B000RIWAV2", "B0016MOWNM", "B000BC8T1E", "B000AL733G", "B0030E5PYO", "B00KUS5YGC", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B008X8VM1W", "B000HEVZ94", "B00JK47BHM", "B00026L7OU", "B00KB614HQ", "B0045Z2W0C", "B00004REEI", "B005UL4NF2", "1879505096", "B00I3C1T6G", "B004SUDQCW", "B003NKU9XM", "B000SULWKO", "B006BZ8NSE", "B00KYCA4QY", "B00IED43X0", "B00000F3SB", "B002NPY7GS", "B000AYEIIQ", "B003H9LIU2", "B000092T3Y", "B000E0OBJM", "B00EEEHLKU", "B000F3UAE8", "B00KI27R4M", "B00HHYF56Q", "B000EXDS2A", "B0042FJCKS", "B00IYRLUEG", "B00EQ2KXA0", "B000EOTV98", "B0006Z2NYA", "B00EQ2KXL4", "B000HDR814", "B000BOH8Z0", "B00IXXVCT4", "B00I462XLG", "B00BTYPW7C", "B000068V9T", "B0074B2N9O", "B000TJBNF8", "B00IYJFB2G", "B00363WGIM", "B000CEV3MI", "B002FG9N50", "B00HMOWA0A", "B000FOPPBA", "B00E96AY20", "B000E5N6B6", "B0055SNHQG", "B0002S94BQ", "B00IQAUO48", "B00C25352Q"], "bought_together": ["B00092ZLDK", "B00068NVLQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00068NVLQ", "B000H5U5EE", "B00092ZLDK", "B00BI3XZA0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 27530}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 16.49, "brand": "", "asin": "B0002J4ZX2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ETWSXNM4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Twilight Zone - The Complete Series (Season One)"}

Two other featurettes go behind the scenes of two numbers, and the eight deleted scenes include Kevin Kline's short performance of \"You Do Something to Me.\"  Because the musical numbers have the most replay value, it's convenient that they're listed on the scene-selection menu.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000294SIE", "B00023GGHQ", "B0001WTWXS", "B000294QX6", "B0012GMVH6", "B00094ARN2", "0679727922", "B0000047BH", "B006AC9H92", "6305127670", "B004H0M2X2", "B00005B15A", "B00005IA7Y", "B001DE29SS", "B005MYEQ4U", "B000EBD9SA", "B00GPWEPZ8", "6305161879", "B00008G7UF", "B00000DRCN", "B0000ARD7O", "B00003CX8N", "B000PAAK5A", "B008FYZHZ6", "B0088X7Z6S", "0394582357", "B00008NFR4", "B00005YUPC", "B00FZRP8FU", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B000EWBKMG", "B000F7CEC0", "B0007939MK", "B0000C23T2", "B000056HEA", "0739069640", "B00083FZFE", "B00DL48BM6", "B00AMSQBSU", "B0012OX7DA", "B0059XTUB8", "B003UESJH4", "B004YCKJNI", "B004SEUJBE", "B00005NGAE", "B0008ENIKM", "B001KZOVJK", "B000KWZ7JC", "B003GOP0D4", "B001ECDVJU", "B007XTDWKQ", "B00031TXC2", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B00BTYSIV4", "B00D2CYU2W", "0783240171", "B000HT3PGU", "B00G7QPXUI", "B00008L3U6", "B000RPCK2E", "B00E849QSG", "B000055WFW", "B00441GYV0", "B00E1HIWXU", "B00GUO2SKA", "B005S9EJ14", "B00508W3FW", "B00CFHEF48", "B0045HCJ80", "B0017I79BW", "B001DJ7PR8", "B004ZJHSAM", "B0006SGYM4", "B0007QJ1ZW", "B000ND91YU", "B004SIP9VA", "B007P7UF0G", "B005VH4HCE", "B00000G3I2", "B001D8W7EU", "B003WKQ46E", "B0000CE684", "B0036TGT8Y", "B00005JKNF", "B0001FR54I", "B0090XLDKY", "B00HHYF5EI", "B000FC2FX8", "B003O2H7MA", "B0007ZEOPK", "B00GWWV1XU", "B00H83EUQW", "B004G7XCRQ", "B00003CXC9", "B00GHP8SH4", "B00008DDRU", "B000KNFP6G", "6305803765", "B0001CNRBG"], "bought_together": ["B000294SIE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0001WTWXS", "B00023GGHQ", "B000294SIE", "B00094ARN2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10160}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.48, "brand": "Generic", "asin": "B00067BBLY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51E8VXPWJML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "De-Lovely: The Cole Porter Story (Special Edition)"}
{"description": "Anybody hungering for a good old-fashioned Western needs to check outWarriors of Heaven and Earth, which--although it's set in 7th-century China--has all the valor and spectacle of a John Ford picture. It also has a goofy supernatural streak, for the chopsocky crowd. The opening 10 minutes or so offer an alarmingly convoluted plot, but it swiftly settles down. What's going on is that a long-exiled Japanese hit man (Kiichi Nakai), hired to kill a renegade Chinese warrior (Jiang Wen), temporarily teams up with his quarry in order to escort a camel caravan along the Spice Road. Of course, they are menaced by a brutal warlord, and beautiful Zhao Wei (So Close) is mixed in there too. Director He Ping (Red Firecracker, Green Firecracker) captures some magnificent vistas in the Gobi Desert, but more importantly he sketches the codes or honor and behavior essential to any such tale.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001MEJY9G", "B00104AYGK", "B002C6VMIY", "B0019PL2W0", "B006C1S1DY", "B000E1EHPE", "B0030A6ICG", "B004TFTE9A", "B000ICLU7C", "B009VL2AZM", "B003DVB7F0", "B005FQ1OOK", "B006MWA91A", "B0035JHYHA", "B000MRA592", "B0056OZI0W", "B00B6OEE7O", "B00ET2ODYY", "B0016MJ6JC", "B008XEZXES", "B008645YLM", "B005ZMBEXA", "B00G3HOJZ6", "B00576U9HQ", "B009VL2A5M", "B004VW4V9E", "B00ENTX7JU", "B0056OZI16", "B004SIP88Y", "B005F96UGO", "7885142833", "B0051SFTGQ", "B000EE3FUY", "B000K2UW06", "B001F34HT6", "B008IG0B0C", "B008OTTRE4", "B00HSJ2EMI", "B003EVAG4C", "B000P6R9N0", "B004XQO8MS", "B005F96UHI", "7885142515", "B003G715IK", "B00B4MMVVY", "B000MM0LEG", "B00GXFZOYI", "B001R10BDW", "B0007Q6VXC", "B0004Z302Q", "B001MEJY9Q", "B0056OZI0M", "B005ZMBEXU", "B007S0DCUU", "B00CDSILB2", "B008FIPRGG", "B00BTFK014", "B005E7SEZW", "B0056OZHZS", "B00FLCYIAA", "B001L67A4G", "B0000U0X1Q", "B0018PH3NS", "B00C3ALL9O", "B0058M0848", "B006JD48GY", "B000BNXD6Y", "B000I0RNWU", "B001AZIRWW", "B004P8R9O8", "B000FELD8Y", "B003OXGW5M", "B006UTDH6O", "B0087AOYG6", "B00393SFTS", "B005M9VSMI", "B004U7MR0K", "B004I1AGTC", "B003YOZNFQ", "B003NLE5JA", "B0010SAGHS", "B0089BSO8C", "B004H2CXBQ", "B00518HB4O", "B00H47IXJW", "B005KG4CUS", "B000MM0LE6", "B00003CXR4", "B001BEK8HO", "B0013D8LCM", "B0076XTIWU", "B003LN0NXC", "B005DKS1TE", "B0054EKDEU", "B000WGZGOC", "B00EI3Y1QO", "B003INBNXO", "B00518HBAI", "B00004STDA", "B00EI3XAZC"], "bought_together": ["B002C6VMIY", "B001MEJY9G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001MEJY9G", "B00104AYGK", "B000ICLU7C", "B0019PL2W0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 37716}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.21, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000683VH0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510MAF5FwPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Warriors of Heaven and Earth"}

Ensconced in a fantastic loft paid for by her parents (Barry Primus, Karen Allen), the unemployed Vera embarks on an odyssey that begins with a mutually deceitful job interview with a college professor (Toback), leads to misadventures in questionable perception in Central Park, and climaxes with Vera's successful manipulation of two powerful men, one a craven lover (Fred Weller) and the other an Italian billionaire (Dominic Chianese) trying to get her in bed for a lot of money.

{"description": "From its charming and angst-ridden first season to the darker, apocalyptic final one, Buffy the Vampire Slayer succeeds on many levels, and in a fresher and more authentic way than the shows that came before or after it. How lucky, then, that with the release of its boxed set of seasons 1-7, you can have the estimable pleasure of watching a near-decade of Buffy in any order you choose. (And we have some ideas about how that should be done.)\n\nFirst: rest assured that there's no shame in coming to Buffy late, even if you initially turned your nose up at the winsome Sarah Michelle Gellar kicking the hell out of vampires (in Buffy-lingo, vamps), demons, and other evil-doers. Perhaps you did so because, well, it looked sort of science-fiction-like with all that monster latex. Start with season 3 and see that Buffy offers something for everyone, and the sooner you succumb to it, the quicker you'll appreciate how textured and riveting a drama it is.\n\nWhy season 3? Because it offers you a winning cast of characters who have fallen from innocence: their hearts have been broken, their egos trampled in typically vicious high-school style, and as a result, they've begun to realize how fallible they are.

{"description": "Marvel Comics'Fantastic Fouranimated series (1994-95)--depicting the first family of superheroes--got significantly better as it went along.  The series always had good intentions, borrowing plots, concepts, characters, and even lines of dialogue from the classicStan Lee-Jack Kirby comic booksthat kicked off the Marvel age of comics.  And it was willing to spend two or even three episodes on a single story line.  The early episodes, however, had serious drawbacks, such as a clumsy animation style (the Silver Surfer never looked less noble), weak humor (the origin episode created a framing sequence in which the FF appears on theDick Cavett Show), and an awful theme song by Giorgio Moroder (Flashdance,Top Gun).  Fortunately, the animation improved in the second season, and instrumental theme music replaced the song.  Memorable moments from the series include the monumental Frightful Four-Inhumans tie-in and Galactus's search for a new herald. Memorable characters include villains Doctor Doom, the Skrulls, the Mole Man, and the Puppet Master, and heroes Daredevil, the Black Panther, Thor, and the Hulk. Guest voices include Ron Perlman, Michael Dorn, Kathy Ireland, Mark Hamill, and John Rhys-Davies.  It's worth a look for FF fans, especially in the complete four-disc set that contains all 29 episodes, a welcome change from Disney's single-disc compilations of theSpider-Manseries from the same time period.

{"description": "From Hollywood's legendary Cocoanut Grove to the pioneering conquest of the wild blue yonder, Martin Scorsese'sThe Aviatorcelebrates old-school filmmaking at its finest. We say \"old school\" only because Scorsese's love of golden-age Hollywood is evident in his approach to his subject--Howard Hughes in his prime (played by Leonardo DiCaprio in his)--and especially in his technical mastery of the medium reflecting his love for classical filmmaking of the studio era. Even when he's using state-of-the-art digital trickery for the film's exciting flight scenes (including one of the most spectacular crashes ever filmed), Scorsese's meticulous attention to art direction and costume design suggests an impassioned pursuit of craftsmanship from a bygone era; every frame seems to glow with gilded detail. And while DiCaprio bears little physical resemblance to Hughes during the film's 20-year span (late 1920s to late '40s), he efficiently captures the eccentric millionaire's golden-boy essence, and his tragic descent into obsessive-compulsive seclusion. Bolstered by Cate Blanchett's uncannily accurate portrayal of Katharine Hepburn as Hughes' most beloved lover,The Aviatoris easily Scorsese's most accessible film, inviting mainstream popularity without compromising Scorsese's artistic reputation. As compelling crowd-pleasers go, it's a class act from start to finish.--Jeff ShannonDVD FeaturesIn his commentary track, director Martin Scorsese offers his own impressions of Howard Hughes and rattles off his memories of experiencing Hughes's films.  He mentions how he made Cate Blanchett watch every Katharine Hepburn film from the '30s on the big screen, and observes that Kate Beckinsale had \"a real sense of the stature of a Hollywood goddess.\"  But in general he doesn't talk much about the craft of making the film.  That area is covered better by editor Thelma Schoonmaker, who also appears on the commentary track, and producer Michael Mann makes a few appearances (all were recorded separately).  The picture is brilliant, but the 5.1 sound is not as aggressive in the rear speakers and subwoofer as one might expect, other than some nice surround effects in theHell's Angelsflying sequence.The second disc collects almost three hours of features.  There's one unnecessary deleted scene, and an 11-minute making-of featurette that's basically the cast and director heaping praise on each other.  More interesting are the short featurettes on visual effects (including the XF-11 scene, of course), production design, costumes, hair and makeup, and score, and Loudon Wainwright discusses his and his children's musical performances.  Historical perspective is provided by spotlights on Hughes's role in aviation and his obsessive-compulsive disorder, and a 43-minute Hughes documentary from the History Channel (part of the Modern Marvels series, it focuses on his mechanical innovations and spends less than a minute on his movies).  More unusual are DiCaprio and Scorsese's appearance on an OCD panel, and a half-hour interview segment DiCaprio did with Alan Alda.--David HoriuchiThe Personalities ofThe AviatorClick the links to explore more movies by these stars.Leonardo DiCaprioasHoward Hughes\"Sometimes I truly fear that I... am losing my mind.

That same night, the girls are abducted by a gang of high-school jocks. Once rescued, their tormentors receive their just desserts, dying one by one in a chain reaction of gruesome murders, each with a bizarre \"Urban Legend\" twist.

After finishing a motorcycle race in New Hampshire, Bud Clay (Vincent Gallo) loads his racing bike into the back of his van and begins a cross-country odyssey to Los Angeles, where he is to compete in another race. During his trip, he meets three very different women: Violet, a wholesome all-American gas station attendant; Lilly (Cheryl Tiegs), a fellow lost soul he connects with at a highway rest stop; and Rose, a Las Vegas prostitute. Throughout his journey, Bud can never escape his intense feelings for the love of his life, Daisy (Chlo&#xEB; Sevigny), so he plans to reconcile with her when he reaches Los Angeles. Arriving in Los Angeles, Bud checks into a motel before visiting the abandoned home he once shared with Daisy.

{"description": "In its prime,Roseannewas the most honest reflection of American life ever shown on television--and also one of the funniest. The second season of this essential sitcom, built around former standup comedian Roseanne Barr, was perhaps its best. The sterling cast--which featured John Goodman (Raising Arizona,Matinee) as Roseanne's husband Dan; Laurie Metcalf (Dear God) as her sister Jackie; and Lecy Goranson, Sara Gilbert, and Michael Fishman as Becky, Darlene, and D.J., her three kids--were confident and eagerly stretching themselves. The writers (including Joss Whedon, later to createBuffy the Vampire SlayerandFirefly) knew how to write smart but credible dialogue and stories; in one episode, Darlene writes a poem that sounds exactly like a 13 year old girl's poetry, yet squeezes your heart. Watch almost any other sitcom and then watchRoseanne; it's startling how much more naturalRoseannefeels.In the season opener, Becky passes gas in front her classmates at school; but that in itself isn't half as funny as the glee that Darlene takes in describing the event--the kind of viciousness that only real families can cultivate. That's the key toRoseanne's success: The utter believability of the relationships. Dan and Roseanne are a loving couple, but their affection works because their fights are just as potent as their flirting. The relationship between Roseanne and Jackie became particularly strong in this season, as Roseanne fought against Jackie's desire to become a cop and meddled in her relationship with her short-lived fiance Gary (Brian Kerwin); Roseanne and Metcalf developed an interplay that could be caring, playful, and bitterly jealous--and sometimes all three at once. The daily urge of parents to both coddle and strangle their kids was thoroughly explored, as was the fusion of need and contempt children feel for their parents. There is one misstep: A dream episode in which Roseanne goes on trial smacks of star ego in a way the show is normally careful to avoid--and makes clear how sharp the other episodes are. The extras are paltry, but this isn't a collection you get for the frills; the show itself lives up to its reputation.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0058J3S16", "B007C8RZJW", "B007C8RZYC", "B008L0YMUK", "B008L0YN6I", "B00B04NJ12", "B00B04NIOU", "B00BUWD7SO", "B005BIGAL4", "B005ENCIXU", "B008XJM8ZU", "B00BUWD7E8", "B0002W4SX6", "B0007KTBJO", "B0002W4SWW", "B00LBHOCHS", "B000AJJNJK", "B0001ZMWXW", "B000I2J6VE", "B0007US79Y", "B0009YCLBS", "B0007R4SWC", "B0058JEHTS", "B000C1VBAA", "B00GLT2SOA", "B000AJJNIQ", "B000FBH3WC", "B000EBGFQI", "B004D2GMVM", "B000KGGIL4", "B00DJYK1XU", "B0001BS3IY", "B000EYK4H6", "B00000F5W8", "B0058JEHSO", "B000BNTM46", "B00I458456", "B0006J27WY", "B0002NY81M", "B007C8RZQ0", "B000A7PKGW", "B00GOC75YW", "B0000CGNEC", "B00009Y3RW", "B00070HK4C", "B000ENUYG8", "B00008NV4G", "B00GOC74YI", "B0002RQ3MK", "B000640WGM", "B000EHSVKK", "B00D2UMHSI", "B000I2J6W8", "B000EQ45BU", "B0007YXRCW", "B00008AOX3", "B000957O8C", "B0002I838Q", "B000SQFC0O", "B000ND91OA", "B006MFQ4DE", "B00D2UMHB0", "B002E58FT2", "B0001EFV9K", "B008L0YMZA", "B002E58FTW", "B000GRUMQY", "B0001NBNJ8", "B0000AKY3Q", "B0000C9JFQ", "B008L3650M", "B000286S42", "B000FBH3WM", "B000QUTTPG", "B0009I7NH6", "B000EHSVL4", "B000E6ESBW", "B000QFCDAO", "B0007ZSHR6", "B0001907BW", "B0030Y12AA", "B0077T2Z8C", "B0009X7BF0", "B007C8RZL0", "B0000E5NPY", "B0001Z3I1C", "B0009JQN6M", "B000NA1W3Q", "B004MCGNT4", "B000QFCDAY", "B001GP5TMW", "B000E6ESA8", "B004MWLXTY", "B000M341S2", "B00005JOHC", "B002E58FUG", "B008VNI9TC", "B0015XWU9A", "B001OXLGIC"], "bought_together": ["B0058J3S16", "B007C8RZJW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BUWD7E8", "B0058J3S16", "B007C8RZJW", "B007C8RZYC"]}, "price": 24.28, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 160147}, "asin": "B000BBOFFE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5187HTJBAFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Roseanne: Season 2"}

{"description": "On the surface, David Cronenberg may seem an unlikely candidate to directA History of Violence, but dig deeper and you'll see that he's the right man for the job. As an intellectual seeker of meaning and an avowed believer in Darwinian survival of the fittest, Cronenberg knows that the story of mild-mannered small-town diner proprietor Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) is in fact a multilayered examination of inbred human behavior, beginning when Tom's skillful killing of two would-be robbers draws unwanted attention to his idyllic family life in rural Indiana. He's got a loving wife (Maria Bello) and young daughter (Heidi Hayes) who are about to learn things about Tom they hadn't suspected, and a teenage son (Ashton Holmes) who has inherited his father's most prominent survival trait, manifesting itself in ways he never expected. By the time Tom has come into contact with a scarred villain (Ed Harris) and connections that lead him to a half-crazy kingpin (William Hurt, in a spectacular cameo), Cronenberg has plumbed the dark depths of human nature so skillfully thatA History of Violencestands well above the graphic novel that inspired it (indeed, Cronenberg was unaware of the source material behind Josh Olson's chilling adaptation). With hard-hitting violence that's as sudden as it is graphically authentic, this isA History of Violencethat's worthy of serious study and widespread acclaim.--Jeff ShannonOn the DVDOn a single disc and with little fanfare, this DVD makes an excellent case for the best extras of the year. Dive into the one-hour-long documentary and learn more about moviemaking than on many a double-disc. The secret lies in director David Cronenberg's (and his usual crew) folksy casualness in showing off the craft, be it makeup (green screens were used), directing (Cronenberg doesn't storyboard), or art direction (the diner set). It also is very funny to hear about \"fish Fridays\" and how Maria Bello's Uncle Pete became an influence. Even the infamous sex-on-the-staircase scene is diagnosed with candor as stars Viggo Mortensen and Bello act as if there is no backstage camera. There's only one deleted scene, but it's uncommonly deconstructed on why it was filmed and why it was cut (it's a very Cronenbergian dream sequence). A short bit on Cannes is also a delight. So much is here that Cronenberg's smart commentary track is nearly superfluous.

{"description": "So much anticipation pools up around the concluding episode of this concluding season that you might be tempted to head straight for said finale, titled \"Everyone's Waiting\" (and it's so rich you'll find yourself drawn to repeated viewings). But if you can avoid that impulse, it's worth following the full build-up of one crisis after another to get the real payoff. On an episode-by-episode basis,Six Feet Under's fifth season has a decidedly uneven quality, shifting in tone far more drastically, say, than the intensely dark season 4. Character traits that have already been developed at length begin to seem annoyingly repetitious--Nate's (Peter Krause) self-centered frustration and furious lashings out, Billy's (Jeremy Sisto) resurgent psychosis--like leitmotifs run amuck. But this season also benefits from the knowledge we've developed, over the years, of the Fisher family and their loved ones, so that what they end up facing has a real emotional wallop, sometimes jump-starting the drama just where it seems to be in danger of churning itself into circles.It's hardly a spoiler to mention that6fu's final season, though bookended by the promise of new beginnings (a wedding in episode 1 to a departure for new prospects in the 12th episode), centers around loss and a pivotal death. The scripts contain more than an occasional sense of inconsequential filler, while some of the recurring thematics seem forced (we see David continue to cope with the scars from his abduction in the previous episode via over-obvious imagery of facing his \"inner demons\"). Other issues receive especially compelling treatment, above all Brenda's (Rachel Griffiths) desire to have a child and David and Keith's (Mathew St. Patrick) choice to adopt. But the real strength of this season lies in several gripping performances. Ruth (Frances Conroy) touches off a complex series of reactions, simultaneously sympathetic and judgmental, transcending the tendency to appear as a neurotic caricature. The super-talented Lauren Ambrose brings off Claire's emerging self-awareness and maturity with moving touches (she's also got some of the funniest moments as she takes on a stint as a temp in scenes that call to mind the hysterics ofThe Office). Griffiths' Brenda for her part undergoes a parallel maturing process. And as George's daughter Maggie, Tina Holmes adds a welcome tone of contrast.6fu, of course, has always been about the paradoxes of finality. But anyone who has developed an attachment to the show's unique tone and creative sensibility will have a tough time saying goodbye. Alan Ball outdoes himself with his script (and direction) for the finale, \"Everyone's Waiting,\" seeding it with echoes from the pilot episode that will enchant aficionados. And the famous fast-forward visions coursing through Claire's imagination as she heads down the highway give the perfect seal to this set of characters. Extras include especially insightful commentaries, including Ball on the finale, retrospectives, and a mini-feature on6fu's cultural impact. It's safe to say that the show leaves some pretty unforgettable impressions in its wake.--Thomas May", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0009NZ2W4", "B0007R4SWM", "B0001KL5DA", "B005SEDI5M", "B008PJZDXW", "B004BZ5AHI", "B000Q6GUW0", "B00DXP7L88", "B0009MAPXG", "B000V86OKG", "B00915G6WQ", "B005FISBTO", "B003L77GRO", "B0015ABRE2", "B00CNGTV2W", "B002AMVED8", "B002N5N5M0", "B0007YMVWO", "B000Q6GUKW", "B000NA1VI2", "B00008PW1F", "B003CN5SAY", "B000BO7DWI", "B000FFJYE8", "B000RTBDV4", "B000GTLQVW", "B00HW3EXCE", "B0060MYKYY", "B003L77GTC", "B001AQBGM4", "B00EEDNR9A", "B002ZCY8CC", "B00005Y6YJ", "B009LDD54K", "B000067S1G", "B004HW7JH4", "B003L77GS8", "B00166UFSY", "B009TE9HAW", "B0013FSL16", "B001OQCVFG", "B00EIL7E9C", "B00003CXOP", "B000NVI2GU", "B00HUAGZ34", "B00J5LXT44", "B0006FO5LO", "B001RTSPVY", "B0032UYFA6", "B00005NOHO", "B000G1R4TS", "B00031TYBC", "B000EULSR0", "B0038M2AOG", "B001AQR3LC", "B00GWJIDFW", "B001DJLCRC", "B00BUUAV08", "B00008PHCZ", "B0092Q82LC", "B0058YPG1G", "B004YM6JSW", "B0013ZGN9I", "B001PQZYQI", "B003L77GLA", "B003FSTN7U", "B0011UMC72", "B005OTQIK8", "B0013FSL0C", "B004X1VUNI", "B009TE9GNK", "B0009GV9E6", "B00ADQPB50", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B00005Y1YA", "B002ZCY82W", "B000CNE0T2", "B00123BY6S", "B003UD7J6W", "B00HW3EWQQ", "B001GCUER0", "B0032JTV6A", "B005HAOZDQ", "B000PHX5MS", "B0012CJQYG", "B0029O0ANW", "B0041KKZKA", "B002LITH76", "B00BUYWJEA", "B000YABIQ6", "B002N5N5MK", "B000BOH8YG", "B00B2DGYQS", "B0012CJQYQ", "B000EHSVC8", "B0024FAD9C", "B00HUAH14Q", "B000FUTVLO", "B000QUTTPG"], "bought_together": ["B0009NZ2W4", "B0007R4SWM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0009NZ2W4", "B0007R4SWM", "B0001KL5DA", "B002N57KGM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 61152}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 22.73, "brand": "Warner Brothers", "asin": "B000E6EK42", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YWNT8GV4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Six Feet Under - The Complete Fifth Season"}
{"description": "It's more of the same in this box set from the third season ofThe Bob Newhart Show. That's altogether a good thing, as the mid-'70s series (these 24 episodes, compiled on three discs, come from 1974-75) remains a model of restraint in a sea of sit-com overkill, then and now. What a pleasure, not to mention a relief, it is to watch a comedy that manages to be more than a frantic cavalcade of shrill one-liners, would-be witty repartee, and endless sexual innuendo. Not that the show (the first of his two long-running series;Newhartfollowed in 1982), isn't funny. As Bob Hartley, Newhart brings his usual repertoire of deadpan takes, mild physical shtick, and exquisite timing to the part of a sometimes reticent, often confused Chicago psychologist who's not a whole lot more comfortable in his own skin than some of his group therapy patients; it's his equanimity as a performer that keeps the character amusing without going over the top. And while the other roles (including the reliable Suzanne Pleshette as wife Emily, Peter Bonerz as bachelor orthodontist Jerry Robinson, and Bill Daily as neighbor Howard Borden) are also well-defined, this is genuinely an ensemble program, dependent more on the characters' interactions than on the storylines and gags. Without a doubt, some of it will seem dated; when Emily (Pat Finley) moves in with Howard across the hall, the buttoned-up Bob treats his thirtysomething sister as if she were his teenage daughter, a dynamic that will hardly ring true these days. ButThe Bob Newhart Showmakes no effort whatsoever to be hip. Indeed, its very squareness (cf. Bob's ironic description of one of Emily's outfits as \"boss threads\") is a big part of its charm, as is the fact that this is first and foremost a show for grownups. Bonus features include commentary (by Newhart and others) on five episodes, as well as a \"making of\" featurette. Nothing special, but with well over ten hours of material, the set is still a bargain.--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000A9QKSM", "B000G6BL7O", "B000YKYT1M", "B000BOH8YQ", "B00096S480", "B000EXDS02", "B0011N19HI", "B00005JLIC", "B003VTKZ84", "B002WN8IR0", "B00GHH9HW2", "B00HNGC56G", "B00JHH1VUU", "B001OXLGK0", "B006VC3LDO", "B00FM4S7P4", "B000G6BLDI", "B001O4KBN2", "B00KTZALDC", "B000EQ5PTQ", "B00H8KC1N4", "B000MGTQ6G", "B003CNQPME", "B0019BI114", "B000FTC1GW", "B0006IUDYY", "B002PQ7JR4", "B000LXGXY8", "B0011FLGYM", "B000291Q3O", "B00008EY6N", "B0006N2EZK", "B004083REE", "B000YGGNGK", "B000M343AS", "B000WQWPSW", "B00016XN48", "B0025KVNOU", "B002C8YSBU", "B00JDCP0QA", "B000BGR1B4", "B000BF0C8E", "B000F8O2MO", "B000A0GOP0", "B0006N2EZA", "B00K8HAKSW", "B000MXPE6U", "B001DHXT52", "B0031XYLR6", "B000B6CODY", "B000M343B2", "B00GOC74QG", "B00K8HALVI", "B00274SIVK", "B000G0O5J6", "B000EBGE82", "B000FSME10", "B0007TKG76", "B003CNQPMY", "B0007Y08JW", "B000HWZ4IY", "B0014FAIXO", "B0001IN0BC", "B00HRUQB5O", "B000B5XOUM", "B000BYRCF6", "B000H6SY28", "B000PGTPC8", "B00IF0KAYS", "B0001NBNIY", "B006363QHE", "B00JPL3UTS", "B000CCBCCG", "B000UX6TLG", "B00HXWV2JQ", "B000E3L7EQ", "B0041SI7A2", "B000WQWPSM", "B000MQ4WMY", "B000XJD3K2", "B000CELOVI", "B000HIVIOM", "B000QUEQ6I", "B000N2HD6O", "B0007WFY4S", "B0063DOV2Q", "B00652FG7O", "B0009UC7MK", "B001O4KBP0", "B000NTMA1U", "B004MWLXTY", "B00GLPYVT4", "B001GMH8WE", "B004WO9OMA", "B002E58FTC", "B00G5N6C8U", "B00023B1WQ", "B000EQ5UUA"], "bought_together": ["B000A9QKSM", "B000G6BL7O"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000YKYT1M", "B000A9QKSM", "B000G6BL7O", "B00HRUQB5O"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 31374}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 13.75, "brand": "NEWHART,BOB", "asin": "B000E6ES9Y", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510WYPETQ0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Bob Newhart Show - The Complete Third Season"}

{"description": "The legend of Pocahontas and John Smith receives a luminous and essential retelling by maverick filmmaker Terrence Malick. The facts of Virginia's first white settlers, circa 1607, have been told for eons and fortified by Disney's animated films: explorer Smith (Colin Farrell) and the Native American princess (newcomer Q'orianka Kilcher) bond when the two cultures meet, a flashpoint of curiosity and war lapping interchangeably at the shores of the new continent. Malick, who took a twenty year break between his second and third films (Days of Heaven and The Thin Red Line), is a master of film poetry; the film washes over you, with minimal dialogue (you see characters speak on camera for less than a quarter of the film). The rest of the words are a stream-of-consciousness narration--a technique Malick has used before but never to such degree, creating a movie you feel more than watch. The film's beauty (shot in Virginia by Emmanuel Lubezki) and production design (by Jack Fisk) seems very organic, and in fact, organic is a great label for the movie as a whole, from the dreadful conditions of early Jamestown (it makes you wonder why Englishman would want to live there) to the luminescent love story. Malick is blessed with a cast that includes Wes Studi, August Schellenberg, Christopher Plummer, and Christian Bale (who, curiously, was also in the Disney production). Fourteen-year-old Kilcher, the soul of the film, is an amazing find, and Farrell, so often tagged as the next big thing, delivers his first exceptional performance since his stunning debut in Tigerland. James Horner provides a fine score, but is overshadowed by a Mozart concerto and a recurring prelude from Wagner's Das Rheingold, a scrumptious weaving of horns fit to fuel the gentle intoxication of this film. Note: the film was initially 150 minutes, and then trimmed to 135 by Malick before the regular theatrical run. It was also the first film shot in 65mm since Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet. --Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000NOKFHQ", "B000VMIILU", "B000TXNDV6", "B00005PJ8T", "1573623903", "B000UVV24M", "B005LLX582", "B000MGB6NM", "B005KQVE1S", "B000FIHN5M", "B00CX7OW1G", "B003M987QK", "B0012Q732O", "B00003CXBH", "B0009PW4EQ", "B0002Y4PPK", "B005HV6Y5W", "B003LL3FIY", "B00J11U54K", "B004UOHNIY", "B000VKL6ZM", "B00KHWSB5M", "B0001I55YW", "B002O3Z50Q", "B00005QW6V", "0783231202", "B00004XPPG", "B00003CXAF", "B000ARXF8W", "B001MZ5W3M", "B003EYVXRS", "B00406UK7S", "B000A2WP7O", "B00I6JODGO", "B004AOECXI", "B000AARKOO", "B000J4QWMC", "B002GHHHHO", "B0018BD9DA", "B004C45AZU", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B0013D8LC2", "B003EYVXXW", "B0007UDC80", "B000R9U3B0", "B007PXYWNQ", "B0032LV4LS", "B003Y5H5FG", "B00019330O", "B0000TANUI", "B000UJ48SQ", "B00007GZYC", "B000F7CMRM", "B00005JKTP", "B0002YLCG0", "B004P2VQZC", "B002O3Z510", "B006ISJQ26", "B009AMAJPA", "B00009MEKN", "B007WZTMCI", "B003L20IG0", "B000CEV3P0", "B0002DRDBY", "B000ZOXDFA", "B000ASDFF4", "B00AEBB89W", "B00AEFXVCU", "B008220C38", "B00005JLX2", "B007REV4LQ", "B009INAI02", "B000XR9L50", "B005LAII3A", "B00005OSJN", "B002DHACT2", "B00BB67UNW", "B008JFUNKU", "B00005R23V", "B00140PK82", "B00005221M", "B000087F0X", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B004EPYZT4", "B003UYUQZW", "B00AEFY5B6", "B004CQZFH6", "B002ZG977Y", "0800177967", "B001L57ZZG", "B00DL48BM6", "B001JIE7JC", "B003Y7F1OG", "B000N3SU92", "B000NIVJF4", "B001KO1BCQ", "B005J7K9BO", "B000LC55F2", "B0045HCJ9O"], "bought_together": ["B000NOKFHQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000NOKFHQ", "B00005PJ8T", "B005LLX582", "B000VMIILU"]}, "price": 10.08, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 386879}, "asin": "B000EOTTTU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519FGGE3C5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The New World"}

{"description": "A movie that exudes affection and goodwill,The World's Fastest Indianis an unabashed mash note to a lovely character from New Zealand's recent past. Burt Munro, played by Anthony Hopkins, is a cantankerous Kiwi with an obsession:  he's been tinkering with his 1920s-era Indian brand motorcycle for years, pushing it to ever-faster speeds. It's the 1960s, and Burt has the utterly mad idea of taking the bike to the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, site of world records for speed racing. The movie takes a while to get to the journey--and then the journey takes a while--but the genial atmosphere prevails. (People of a certain age, for whom the word \"Bonneville\" evokes pleasant associations with hotrods and world-speed records, will not be disappointed in the film's location shooting, or its sense of awe.) Hopkins is not quite on-the-money casting for the jovial, happy-go-lucky Munro, and his accent wavers, but he nails the emotional scenes and the fascination with speed. Smaller bits are well-filled by Diane Ladd and Christopher Lawford (son of Peter), who looks uncannily of the era. New Zealand director Roger Donaldson doesn't take any chances here, but the story clearly means something to him, and that sense of commitment carries the film through its sleepier moments.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B007SUW27E", "B0000YTP02", "B00004Y62V", "B00000JXVK", "B009R68HIA", "B000S88JT8", "B000022TSY", "B00GHYIQ18", "B0039UU3KA", "B007XF0X52", "B001CDFY50", "B000C3L2PC", "B000QFCD7W", "B0006HBZXS", "B0006FYOTC", "B004GSVX9O", "B001LM64S8", "B00005ONLF", "B0009XT8C4", "B00407PNY2", "B00BEIYP1W", "B00E3ZDTWO", "B0000542CH", "B0001GOH6Q", "B007TBJUVI", "B00I3HFB7E", "B0024FAG6M", "6305989435", "B00000IQW5", "B000OHZJIM", "B000CNFC76", "B001VC99HQ", "B000YAF4MA", "B0001NBLX6", "B00I3HFAIE", "B0003JAO5Y", "B0008ENHUI", "B0002HRKVS", "B000085EFG", "B001KXZGO6", "B00066FBQG", "B00AEFXN9G", "B00AEFY7NM", "B003VRJ89S", "B00002SSKG", "B000LPS34E", "B004SIP7ZS", "B003ASLJO0", "B005LAIGRS", "B003UESJME", "B005CMSDLE", "B008JFURII", "B00GNZLWD0", "B002VWNIBI", "B00D3LA5WG", "B004GJYRI2", "B00AEFYVMO", "B0009NSCS0", "B00AEBBA36", "B0042JIL2E", "B004QBWU02", "B00003CXMY", "B00AZNEW5G", "B00C6QYMJG", "B00AHTYI5M", "6305213283", "B00936A0RU", "B0000B1OFL", "B005EVY8MQ", "6305133468", "B002NZK5UK", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00HZMZ218", "B000A7DVR2", "B00AEFY4IA", "B002M2Z3BA", "B002AS464Q", "B00AG4714S", "B00AEBB932", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00006ADD5", "B00006FDCT", "B000MQC9H4", "B00AEBB86A", "B00AKGG6S4", "B000096IAC", "B00IF0KAYS", "B00005JMCN", "B00DDT0JB0", "B000P0J0EW", "B0018PH3L0", "B00AEBB8YW", "B004DK5CW4", "630560097X", "B00005LOL0", "B00E8G5HZ0", "B003L20IG0", "B000G6BLWE", "B000AP04L0"], "bought_together": ["B0000YTP02"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000YTP02", "B00004Y62V"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5731}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.2, "brand": "MAGNOLIA HOME ENTERTAINMENT", "asin": "B000F8DBDK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QVB6EB2PL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The World's Fastest Indian"}

{"description": "Most TV shows never make it eight seasons, but thenThe Simpsonsis not most TV shows.  At a point where other shows would generally become stale and repetitive, Matt Groening & Co. pull out the stops to come up with one of the most creative and hilarious seasons in the whole series. Cases in point for season eight (1996-1997)  include \"Treehouse of Horror VII,\" in which aliens Kang and Kodos make a bizarre run for President having taken on the appearances of Bill Clinton and Bob Dole; \"Bart After Dark,\" in which Bart gets a job at The Maison Derriere (featuring one of their most popular songs, \"The Spring in Springfield\"); and one of the great all-time episodes, \"The Simpsons Spin-off Showcase,\" a trilogy of Simpsons spin-offs that never made it to prime-time (the final segment--\"The Simpson Family Smile-Time Variety Hour\"--is about the best six minutes of parody in the entireSimpsonscanon). Season eight also features some of the most notable guest appearances: Rodney Dangerfield as Mr. Burns&#x92;s long lost son; Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny as Scully and Mulder fromX-Filesin \"The Springfield Files;\" \"The Brother from Another Series\" which brilliantly pairs up Kelsey Grammar as Sideshow Bob with his brother Cecil (David Hyde Pierce) in a parallel of theirFrasiercharacters; and in a major casting coup, Johnny Cash shows up in the form of a red fox as Homer&#x92;s spirit guide in \"El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Jomer\" (also known as \"The Chili Pepper episode\"). Other notable episodes include \"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show,\" a fun wink to the audience from the writers about keeping the show fresh without ruining it, and the send up ofMary Poppins\"Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(annoyed grunt)cious,\" which has one of their most memorable endings when Shary Bobbins floats off under her umbrella (\"So long Superman,\" Barney cries)... only to get sucked into a jet engine from a passing airplane.

{"description": "Consistently solid with some major developments, the fifth season ofSmallvillekicks the characters off to college, but not before finishing the cataclysmic disaster that ended the fourth season.  With Chloe transported to the Arctic Circle and Kryptonian supervillains in town, Clark (Tom Welling) is in the Fortress of Solitude meeting Jor-El (voiced by Terence Stamp).  He gives up his powers, but to get them back will cost him the life of someone he loves.The even bigger development is that Clark and Lana (Kristin Kreuk) finally give up their dalliances with others and become an official couple.  That means the other girls in Clark's life become fifth and sixth wheels, so Chloe (Allison Mack) reveals the secret she's been keeping from Clark and becomes a best pal.  Super-gorgeous Lois's (Erica Durance, now part of the opening credits) banter with Clark loses its bite without any sexual tension so instead she meets Arthur \"AC\" Curry, a fantastic swimmer who has an eye for Lois and an accusing one toward Lex (Michael Rosenbaum) and LutherCorp.  He's not the only one; Clark's Central Kansas A&M; professor, Milton Fine (James Marsters) hires Clark to help him on his project, an expose of LutherCorp.  Lex is the pivotal character of the season.  His relationship with his best friend, Clark, now history, Lex has aChristmas Carol-type dream in which he sees himself in a law-abiding--and happy--life.  (That episode, \"Lexmas,\" also has some amusing interplay involving Clark and Chloe.)  Undeterred, he decides on a life of power and dives into a state senate race against Jonathan Kent with gusto, though a fanatical Lex supporter turns the race into a literal one for life and death.  Lionel Luthor (John Glover) also makes a strong comeback in this season, pulling unseen levers and making everyone wonder exactly what he knows.There's some fun.  \"Thirst\" is a tribute toBuffy the Vampire Slayer, and another DC Comics character, Cyborg (Teen Titans), appears.  Carrie Fisher plays Chloe's editor atThe Daily Planet, and \"Exposed\" reunites Schneider with formerDukes of Hazzardcostar Tom Wopat, and the two go peeling out in a vehicle.

{"description": "Forget any off-screen impressions you may have of Mel Gibson, and experience Apocalypto as the mad, bloody runaway train that it is. The story is set in the pre-Columbian Maya population: one village is brutally overrun, its residents either slaughtered or abducted, by a ruling tribe that needs slaves and human sacrifices. We focus on the capable warrior Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), although Gibson skillfully sketches a whole population of characters--many of whom don't survive the early reels. Most of the film is set in the dense jungle, but the middle section, in a grand Mayan city, is a dazzling triumph of design, costuming, and sheer decadent terror. The movie itself is a triumph of brutality, as Gibson lets loose his well-established fascination with bodily mortification in a litany of assaults including impalement, evisceration, snakebite, and bee stings. It's a dark, disgusted vision, but Gibson doesn't forget to apply some very canny moviemaking instincts to the violence--including the creation of a tremendous pair of villains (strikingly played by Raoul Trujillo and Rodolfo Palacias). The film is in a Maya dialect, subtitled in English, and shot on digital video (which occasionally betrays itself in some blurry quick pans). Amidst all the mayhem, nothing in the film is more devastating than a final wordless exchange of looks between captured villager Blunted (Jonathan Brewer) and his wife's mother (Maria Isabel Diaz), a superb change in tone from their early relationship. Yes, this is an obsessive, crazed movie, but Gibson knows what he's doing. --Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000UVV24M", "B0012Q732O", "B00003CXAF", "B001BNFRB2", "B000VMIILU", "1573623903", "B002O3Z50Q", "B00004XPPG", "6305692688", "B00028HBKM", "B00004RJ71", "B00AEFXKUI", "B002ZG999U", "B0002YLCG0", "B000VKL6ZM", "B002T9H2LA", "B0000542C6", "B0001CNQX0", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00006ADD5", "B00406UK7S", "B004AOECXI", "B004SIP8W0", "B000R9U3B0", "B00008G8LY", "B00001ZWUS", "B000MGB6NM", "B003EYVXXW", "6304711905", "B004HO6HWA", "B000QXDED6", "B0034G4P58", "B0000714BS", "B000XR9L50", "B00005JLQT", "0783230389", "B002VWNIEA", "B00AZNEW5G", "B008MIMWQW", "B003VA3JZY", "B0002DRDIW", "B000AARKOO", "B00BEJL6JK", "B004SIP7TE", "079283366X", "B00005V9HH", "B000M341QE", "B003HKN52U", "B005IUIXCE", "B00275EGWY", "B003UYUQZW", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002O3Z510", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B002WY65VU", "B000I0RNWU", "B00003CXWV", "B002XMGGK6", "B003NF97NK", "B000QXDCJ2", "B001FB5634", "B001DZOC6Y", "B007STBUHI", "B0000VCZMK", "B0013FDM7E", "B00015YVDG", "B003IY498Y", "6305433925", "B000P0J0AG", "B00005K3NR", "B000O76ZQC", "B003ELKNH2", "B00018D3ZA", "6304821832", "B00AEBBA36", "B009YQJ322", "B00005JL3T", "079284646X", "B002CA68MU", "B00BTYJYR6", "B00AEFYE08", "B000P0J09C", "B005LAIHPE", "B00441GZ1Y", "B001OQCV2E", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000BITV9W", "B004LWZW4M", "B005LAIIRQ", "B00003CXBH", "B000A2WP7O", "B001GCUO0W", "B00005JPD0", "B00AMSLDTM", "B000RTB0R6", "B00005JA8B", "B00009PY4G", "0783226039", "B000B8QG22", "B000069I1I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001BNFRB2", "B00028HBKM", "B00001ZWUS", "B00004XPPG"]}, "price": 10.55, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 53938}, "asin": "B000GNOKQG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41yXQu76-NL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Apocalypto (2006) (2007) Rudy Youngblood; Raoul Trujillo; Mel Gibson"}

{"description": "This Jack Black vehicle seems, on the surface, like a perfect fit for the actor: an opportunity to showcase Black's unique style with the extreme facial gestures and exuberant physicality that have become his forte. Black plays Ignacio, a lowly cook in a monastery in central Mexico who feeds orphans by day, and wrestles in the town square at night. Ignacio teams up with Esqueleto (Hector Jimenez), a street urchin who tormented him, to form a tag-team duo that goes up against the strangest wrestlers Mexico has to offer. Besides doing it for money to feed the orphans, Ignacio is also fighting to win the forbidden affections of Sister Encarnacion (Ana de la Reguera) with predictable difficulty. While the movie has likeable characters and the plot is enjoyable enough, it can&#x92;t overcome its plodding pace and formulaic structure enough to keep the movie interesting throughout. Jack Black is a very strong comedic actor, and the wrestling scenes offer plenty of chances for slapstick, physical comedy, but watching him run around in red briefs and blue tights amounts to half the laughs in the movie, and there&#x92;s just not enough here for him to really work with. When he plays a more well-formed character, as inSchool of RockandHigh Fidelity, his strengths really show. But inNacho Librehe&#x92;s saddled with a caricature. Weighed down by too much low-brow humor and a script that goes nowhere,Nacho Librejust can&#x92;t make full enough use of Black&#x92;s talents to overcome the obstacles.--Daniel Vancini", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00H47IXTC", "B003498RCW", "B00AEFYP3E", "B00AEBB87O", "B00AEFY7YQ", "B001IKKMCW", "B001GPOSYC", "B00AEFYYA8", "B00BG4R476", "B00AEBB9C8", "B004IK30S2", "B000WQWPJQ", "B004SJ0EBE", "B005ERX1UU", "B0018O4YSQ", "B005DZ35TU", "B00AEFXXFU", "B00CXYCBNA", "B00AEFYRVO", "B002KLAL8S", "B00193F304", "B00E9E4F68", "B0062VL4XS", "B00AEFXIQE", "B00E3QJ7FG", "B00CXY9WIM", "B00H7KJTCG", "B004ZJZQ1A", "B00DYEN6XC", "B00HWWUQYY", "B007Q1GJA6", "B000MEYFXW", "B00AEBBAEA", "B00AEFXJNQ", "B001G5T6GC", "B00JL6L4WC", "B00H83EV5W", "B00COHGPQA", "B008V5UQZK", "B003IWZ750", "B008JFUR10", "B008MIMWOO", "B00AEBBAF4", "B004TJ1H0A", "B004047XWU", "B006WZIETG", "B005KQVDH8", "B002ZG97WO", "B0014DFCMS", "B00267QOEQ", "B0021L9ME6", "B001O7JHW0", "B001IKKMD6", "B00AEFXDGE", "B0090SI582", "B004RQDPBE", "B0014BQQZM", "B001KZVQJI", "B0082JRF7C", "B001KEHAHQ", "B000J4P9PI", "B0029XFN8A", "B00CTSDDVO", "B001CW7ZUS", "B00COHGORU", "B00HERGM86", "B0093LE2OC", "B0047685I2", "B00BLN4UDI", "B004RQDYXI", "B00DHHWY9I"], "bought_together": ["B00H47IXTC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001JNNDE2", "B0082JRF7C", "B0054OGQOQ", "B005ERX1UU"]}, "price": 19.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 149245}, "asin": "B000HDZK1Y", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51sDOKT8e4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Nacho Libre [Blu-ray]"}
{"description": "It's inevitable thatThe Groomsmenwould invite comparisons toWedding Crashers, but it's actually closer in spirit toDiner. Or Fellini's semi-autobiographicalI Vitelloni, which writer/director Edward Burns has claimed as an influence. Sure, the film has its comedic moments, but it isn't a comedy. Sure, Burns and his on-screen pals can be louts, but that's where the similarities to the Owen Wilson/Vince Vaughn vehicle end. There's only one wedding in the picture and Paulie (Burns) doesn't need to crash it--he's the one getting married. His fianc&#xE9;e, Sue (Brittany Murphy, who worked with Burns onSidewalks of New York), is pregnant, so the time has come. Paulie, a Long Island reporter, isn't sure he's ready for the responsibility of marriage and fatherhood. His best buddies, Dez (Mathew Lillard), T.C. (John Leguizamo), cousin Mike (Jay Mohr), and brother Jimbo (Donal Logue), aren't exactly helping to prepare him for the big day. That's because they've got problems of their own and because they're more concerned about getting the band together one last time (a humorous, if overly familiar plot device).

The rubbery face of Marlon Wayans (White Chicks) is digitally transposed onto the body of an actual midget so that Marlon can play Calvin, a bad-tempered thief who's trying to retrieve a humongous diamond from the purse of Vanessa (Kerry Washington,Ray), the buppie wife of Darryl (Shawn Wayans,Scary Movie 2). Darryl doesn't care about his wife's new promotion, he just wants to have a child--and he gets one when Calvin arrives on his doorstep dressed in baby clothes. At which point, the kicks, head-butts, and blunt object trauma to the groin begin. It's beside the point to argue whether or not this is definitively funny; blows to the groin either make you laugh or they don't, and if they do, you know who you are and you should seek this movie out. It will give you all you could possibly ask for, including numerous jokes about bodily functions and breasts.

{"description": "If Richard Donner's 1978 feature filmSuperman: The Moviemade us believe a man could fly, Bryan Singer's 2006 follow-up,Superman Returns, lets us remember that a superhero movie can make our spirits soar. Superman (played by newcomer Brandon Routh) comes back to Earth after a futile five-year search for his destroyed home planet of Krypton. As alter ego Clark Kent, he's eager to return to his job at the Daily Planet and to see Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth). Lois, however, has moved on: she now has a fianc&#xE9; (James Marsden), a son (Tristan Leabu), and a Pulitzer Prize for her article entitled \"Why the World Doesn't Need Superman.\" On top of this emotional curveball, his old archrival Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) is plotting the biggest land grab in history.Singer, who made a strong impression among comic-book fans for his work on the X-Men franchise and directed Spacey inThe Usual Suspects, brings both a fresh eye and a sense of respect to the world's oldest superhero. He borrows John Williams's great theme music and Marlon Brando's voice as Jor-El, and the story (penned by Singer'sX-Mencollaborators Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris) is a sort-of-sequel to the first two films in the franchise (choosing to ignore that the third and fourth movies ever happened). The humorous and romantic elements give the movie a heart, Singer's art-deco Metropolis is often breathtaking, and the special effects are elegant and spectacular, particularly an early airplane-disaster set-piece. Of the cast, Routh is excellent as the dual Superman/Clark, Spacey is both droll and vicious as Luthor, and Parker Posey gets the best lines as Luthor's moll Kitty. But at 23, Bosworth seems too young for the five-years-past-grizzled Lois. It's nice to see Noel Neill, Jack Larson (both from the classicAdventures of SupermanTV series), and Eva Marie-Saint on the screen as well. Superman Returns is one of those projects that was in development for seemingly forever, but it was worth the wait -- it's the most enjoyable superhero movie sinceSpider-Man 2andThe Incredibles.--David HoriuchiMore SupermanWatch our exclusive interviews with the cast ofSuperman ReturnsOther feature filmsSuperman in high definitionSmallvilleAdventures of SupermanSee all Superman DVDs", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001DJLD2G", "B000IJ79VQ", "B000IJ79X4", "B000IJ79XE", "B000IJ79WU", "B008JFUPFI", "B000IJ79UW", "B001CDR1FG", "B000ION23U", "B002GSXKN8", "B004EPZ07K", "B0000959N0", "B00005JNTU", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001DHXT20", "B000VI70QS", "B0006L0LOS", "B0007P0Y7C", "B000UR9T8C", "B00005JNJV", "B00005JMQW", "B00005JKCH", "B000AYELVU", "B004LWZW42", "B0090SI56Y", "B001OST0LW", "B001OST0M6", "B001QB9H1U", "B000HCO83Q", "B000PE0G0A", "B001GCUO1Q", "B0002IQMAM", "B004LWZWGA", "B008JFUS0U", "B000P0J06K", "B000OVLBF8", "B00E5I2MCM", "B003YAR97K", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00080ZG2O", "B003QO8TOQ", "B001FB55HQ", "B005LAIGW8", "B000I8OM94", "B000FO0AHY", "B00IZZDWKM", "B000P0J06U", "B0007V6ITE", "B008JFUO72", "B000AYELVA", "B002NXSRVG", "B00DYEN6XC", "B00E5I2MEK", "B000BT96EG", "B001HQZJMU", "B001QTXM5Y", "B00E5I2M6I", "B002HWRYJE", "B00E5I2M9K", "B001614E68", "B000059Z8L", "B001VLBDD0", "B000EU1Q3Q", "B000EU1Q2M", "B000KJU1KK", "B00BTYMPUY", "B000H30B2C", "B001F7MSFM", "B0013BM63O", "B00F4FFO8E", "B000EGDB10", "B00008G8M5", "B00JPS7HOA", "0790738953", "B000B7QCGS", "B000HWZ4E8", "B00BBXSPES", "B000FMGTTE", "B0083SBMBM", "B003Z8ZCDO", "B005LAII44", "B000P6XQ50", "B000VI28Z6", "B00AZMFJYA", "B001RHGRT8", "B000F4RH8E", "B002ZG99B8", "B001AK3S4Y", "B00005JL78", "B0002ZMHX6", "B0007G89FU", "B006VRRGNK", "B00BBAQD6S", "B009JBWOU0", "B000BT96FA", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00BGI086Q", "B003UN2ICM", "B0000VCZMK"], "bought_together": ["B008JFUPFI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008JFUPFI", "B00F4FFO8E", "B001DJLD2G", "B000IJ79UW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 57565}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.73, "brand": "DC Comics", "asin": "B000J10EQU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ddmxk8VML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Superman Returns (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "During WWII, a human heart taken from a certain lab in Europe (Dr. Frankenstein&#x92;s) is kept in a Japanese lab.  When it gets exposed to the radiation of the bombing of Hiroshima, the heart grows in size, mutates and sprouts appendages, and eventually grows into a complete body and escapes.

{"description": "Pile together a blue-ribbon cast, a screenplay high in quirkiness, and the Sundance stamp of approval, and youve got yourself a crossover indie hit. That formula worked for Little Miss Sunshine, a frequently hilarious study of family dysfunction. Meet the Hoovers, an Albuquerque clan riddled with depression, hostility, and the tattered remnants of the American Dream; despite their flakiness, they manage to pile into a VW van for a weekend trek to L.A. in order to get moppet daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) into the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. Much of the pleasure of this journey comes from watching some skillful comic actors doing their thing: Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette as the parents (hes hoping to become a self-help authority), Alan Arkin as a grandfather all too willing to give uproariously inappropriate advice to a sullen teenage grandson (Paul Dano), and a subdued Steve Carell as a jilted gay professor on the verge of suicide. The film is a crowd-pleaser, and if anything is a little too eager to bend itself in the direction of quirk-loving Sundance audiences; it can feel forced. But the breezy momentum and the ingenious actors help push the material over any bumps in the road. -- Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000YABYLA", "B00005JMJG", "B001UV4XGU", "B00A81MV3U", "B00DL46ZN8", "B00005JNC2", "B0007TKOAA", "B001UV4XUG", "B00005ALS0", "B00118T632", "B00AEFXESQ", "B007L6VR12", "B008220BA2", "B003L20ICE", "B0000640VJ", "B008OHV49W", "B001P9KR8U", "B000A7DVR2", "B00000F5MN", "B007L6VRBM", "B00AFEY354", "B0001GOH6Q", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00337KM2S", "B000H0MKOC", "B004UXUX4Q", "B0034G4OZE", "B00011CZRE", "B00275EGWY", "0205751989", "B000FVQLQQ", "B0010X8NF0", "B004SIP95G", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B004QL7KKC", "B00079Z9VO", "B00003CXZ4", "B0021L8UOY", "B001MM3AZM", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00606P0BM", "B00005Q4CS", "B00ADRYCWC", "B001TOD92C", "B004SEUIW4", "B000P0J0EW", "B0015OKWKI", "B000CS464G", "B0007PLLBU", "B00009W5CA", "B00005JLSB", "B004A8ZWV0", "B007RKFXUS", "B0010AN7Z4", "B00012QLB4", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B003UESJH4", "B00005JNBQ", "B007VYE4PK", "B000WZEZGI", "B00AEBB9F0", "6304907729", "B003Y5H574", "B000SFOW8I", "B00005JMJ4", "B001BL96K2", "B00006FMUW", "B002VPTJOA", "B00003CXO1", "B000J103OI", "B0038N9WKU", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00008975Z", "B003ASLJQI", "B0049985XW", "B003ASLJO0", "B001J9KJ4I", "B001FZQOW2", "B00000G02H", "1557047707", "B000BYRCQU", "B00121QGPY", "B00005JL57", "B000021Y77", "B000A3XY5A", "B000MZHW40", "B0000AC8LR", "B00AEFY0KW", "B0045HCJ9E", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B00AEBB9FA", "B00005A06N", "B000ELJAEM", "B00AEFYAMA", "B00E8RKHWW", "B00005JLRE", "B005LAIHE0", "B000M341QE", "B0039UT3LK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00118T632", "B00DL46ZN8", "B0007UC8Y4", "B001AGXEAG"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 401537}, "asin": "B000JU9OJ4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51T7A7BDBWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Little Miss Sunshine [Region 2]"}

{"description": "An art-house film filled with more humor and skilled acting than most Hollywood blockbusters,Ten Canoesis a wry story within a story. The tone of the film is set when narrator David Gulpilil (Crocodile Dundee) says, \"Once upon a time in a land far, far away....\" He stops himself with a warm, hearty chuckle and adds, \"I'm only joking.\" Director Rolf de Heer does a fine job with his cast of novice actors, who depict a life most moviegoers are unfamiliar with. Set in Australia's far northern Arnhem Land, the film--which won the Special Jury Prize at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival--tells the tale of friendship, deception, and forbidden love. Ten tribesmen venture on a trip where they will build canoes, gather food, and gossip about their sexual prowess and their wives. During the trip, Minygululu (Peter Minygululu) regales his younger brother Dayindi (played by David Gulpilil's son, Jamie Gulpilil) with stories of a man who lusts after his older sibling's wife. It is giving nothing away to reveal that Dayindi has a crush on Minygululu's youngest bride. Handled differently, the film could've been saddled with the ick factor of siblings chasing after the same young woman. But the way de Heer presents it, it is a parable that distinguishes between right and wrong, in an entertaining and non-judgmental way. Cinematographer Ian Jones is to be commended for his amazing work. He frames the shots in a superb fashion and showcases the raw beauty of the land--and the people--that time has forgotten.--Jae-Ha Kim", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JLD4", "B000A7Q2KA", "B000EPFTY8", "B00393SG42", "B00006RG78", "B004326F50", "B001EAWMP6", "B0007UDC80", "B00005QAPI", "B0001I55Y2", "B003RHZ67K", "B0000A02Y4", "B00267OBBE", "B005HP2J66", "B000GIW9I2", "B00001ODHV", "B005EVJCOA", "B008LFYZAM", "B00D2UMHQ0", "B0000542C6", "B00BTYJYR6", "6305428417", "B00DEKKEPO", "B001DWNUD8", "B00G7QPYX4", "B003102JDM", "B00019330O", "B00005JKJA", "0780021134", "B00A1AU64E", "B005I0DV4Y", "B00003CXB5", "B004UOHNIY", "079284646X", "B000KX0IOA", "B003D3Y692", "186465032X", "0934971374"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JLD4", "B000A7Q2KA", "B00393SG42", "B00006RG78"]}, "price": 22.49, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 295320}, "asin": "B000K7VKX4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Dc5rc0gLL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ten Canoes"}

{"description": "Academy Award&reg;-winner Kathy Bates (Lead Actress,Misery, 1990) and Academy Award&reg;-nominee Alfre Woodard (Supporting Actress,Cross Creek, 1983) star as the matriarchs of two very different families being torn apart by greed and scandal in the contemporary dramaTyler Perry's The Family That Preys.  The sixth feature film by Perry chronicles the inner workings of two families&mdash;one upper-crust and the other working class&mdash;that become inextricably linked by scandal.    Wealthy socialite Charlotte Cartwright (Kathy Bates) and her dear friend Alice Pratt (Alfre Woodard), a working class woman of high ideals, have enjoyed a lasting friendship throughout many years.  Suddenly, their lives become mired in turmoil as their adult children&rsquo;s extramarital affairs, unethical business practices and a dark paternity secret threaten to derail family fortunes and unravel the lives of all involved. Alice&rsquo;s self-centered newlywed daughter Andrea (Sanaa Lathan) is betraying her trusting husband Chris (Rockmond Dunbar) by engaging in a torrid affair with her boss and mother&rsquo;s best friend&rsquo;s son William (Cole Hauser).  While cheating on his wife Jillian (KaDee Strickland) with a string of ongoing dalliances with his mistress Andrea, William&rsquo;s true focus is to replace the COO of his mother&rsquo;s lucrative construction corporation.  Meanwhile, Alice&rsquo;s other daughter Pam (Taraji P. Henson), a kind but no nonsense woman married to a hard working construction worker (Tyler Perry), tries to steer the family in a more positive direction.    While paternity secrets, marital infidelity, greed and unsavory business dealings threaten to derail both families, Charlotte and Alice decide to take a breather from it all by making a cross-country road trip in which they rediscover themselves and possibly find a way to save their families from ruin inTyler Perry's The Family That Preys.BeyondTyler Perry's The Family That Preyson DVDTyler Perry's Meet the Brownson DVDTyler Perry's Why Did I Get Marriedon DVDTyler Perry's Daddy's Little Girlson DVD", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001132GNY", "B000PE0GRI", "B0018RNF60", "B003Y5H56K", "B002ZG99RW", "B005LAIH1S", "B00097DXFS", "B002VKB0LU", "B000F9SO0O", "B0026JI1R2", "B008SOS7W8", "B003Y5H4ZC", "B00BEL4QFO", "B001QUF7DS", "B003Y5H58S", "B0055OTDCM", "B008FCX2D2", "B0009A40NE", "B00AZMFJ90", "B0009A40NY", "B003UEYBPI", "B000YAF4Q6", "B002VECM4A", "B001JV5BC6", "B0088RMEII", "B003L16FCC", "B00066FAQW", "B005LAIH86", "B00AJLHVES", "B008SOSB0G", "B001DJLCQS", "B000BQ7J8Y", "0783240201", "B000FA57JE", "B0009A40NO", "B00HW3EI3I", "B005KR6NNG", "B000XT1P52", "B0009A40O8", "B00CWBPQ22", "B0010YVCAW", "B000FA57IU", "B00JPFTW1E", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B0041H55SK", "B0041H55S0", "B00004Y2R1", "B007P9HVJC", "B00GOZ2LPM", "B0041H55RQ", "B002CA68NO", "B00BNV9WCW", "B002CAWNEM", "B00H47IX5G", "6305505780", "B00007L4KF", "B006IVNIS6", "B000A6T2KS", "B000F3UA5M", "B00066FAVW", "B0018RNF74", "B00AEFYHVO", "B00EJU9GQ6", "B000HDZKLO", "B00005JLG1", "B00AMEZDJW", "B008SOSCHS", "B005OK721G", "B001KKU9DM", "B00BYS0RQE", "B00000JGHV", "B00AEFXTKO", "B005DCJ3LM", "6305428409", "B0053YT3II", "B00066FAC6", "B00005ASOO", "B00003CY51", "B00AEFXY6I", "B000FUH35U", "B007SS7MAS", "B000VZADPG", "B002NZK5VO", "B00AEFYQWO", "B0034G4P1C", "B0018W2L1A", "B003VEL8ZS", "B000P0J092", "B000JLTRH2", "B0072GOJ98", "B007Q2GR9I", "B000BITV9W", "B00005ALM8", "1558908390", "B005KR6NQS", "B00005LB86", "B00005JPK8", "B00465I1CE", "B000XSWVEC", "B00005JNRM"], "bought_together": ["B001132GNY", "B003Y5H56K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003Y5H56K", "B000F9SO0O", "B00097DXFS", "B0018RNF60"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5943}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.89, "brand": "Lionsgate", "asin": "B000LW7REE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TziuSehYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Family That Preys (Full Screen Edition)"}
{"description": "Martin Scorsese makes a welcome return to the mean streets (of Boston, in this case) withThe Departed, hailed by many as Scorsese's best film sinceCasino. Since this crackling crime thriller is essentially a Scorsese-stamped remake of the acclaimed 2002 Hong Kong thrillerInfernal Affairs, the film was intensely scrutinized by devoted critics and cinephiles, and while Scorsese's intense filmmaking and all-star cast deserve ample acclaim,The Departedis also worthy of serious re-assessment, especially with regard to what some attentive viewers described as sloppy craftsmanship (!), notably in terms of mismatched shots and jagged continuity. But no matter where you fall on the Scorsese appreciation scale, there's no denying thatThe Departedis a signature piece of work from one of America's finest directors, designed for maximum impact with a breathtaking series of twists, turns, and violent surprises. It's an intricate cat-and-mouse game, but this time the cat and mouse are both moles: Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is an ambitious cop on the rise, planted in the Boston police force by criminal kingpin Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a hot-tempered police cadet who's been artificially disgraced and then planted into Costello's crime operation as a seemingly trustworthy soldier. As the multilayered plot unfolds (courtesy of a scorching adaptation byKingdom of Heavenscreenwriter William Monahan), Costigan and Sullivan conduct a volatile search for each other (they're essentially looking for \"themselves\") while simultaneously wooing the psychiatrist (Vera Farmiga) assigned to treat their crime-driven anxieties.Such convenient coincidences might sink a lesser film, butThe Departedis so electrifying that you barely notice the plot-holes. And while Nicholson's profane swagger is too much \"Jack\" and not enough \"Costello,\" he's still a joy to watch, especially in a film that's additionally energized by memorable (and frequently hilarious) supporting roles for Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg, and a host of other big-name performers.The Departedalso makes clever and plot-dependent use of cell-phones, to the extent that it couldn't exist without them. Powered by Scorsese's trademark use of well-chosen soundtrack songs (from vintage rock to Puccini's operas),The Departedmay not be perfect, but it's one helluva ride for moviegoers, proving popular enough to become the biggest box-office hit of Scorsese's commercially rocky career.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002ZG99N6", "B000P0J09M", "B004SIP7TE", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002ZG980U", "B002VWNIEA", "B00011CZRE", "B00AEBB8NI", "B002T9H2LA", "B00005JLSB", "B000MZHW40", "B00080ZG10", "B003ASLJQS", "B000P0J0AG", "B000P0J0EW", "B000C20VPA", "B003UESJHO", "B004SIP7ZS", "B003ASLJO0", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AHTYI5M", "B00275EGWY", "B000XR9L50", "B000A3XY5A", "B0007DFJ0G", "B001N44BVQ", "B00003CXWV", "B008MILL8W", "B000286RP2", "B004SIP7VM", "B00005V9HH", "6305313687", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004FQX5B6", "B00AEFXKUI", "B004SIP95G", "B00AEBB86A", "B005LAIIJY", "B0016Q2D66", "B003ASLJQI", "B00008975Z", "B000IY04Q8", "B001P9KR8U", "B00005JNJV", "B000C20VRS", "B008R65XYC", "B005LAIGRS", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00008DP4C", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00005JN0W", "B005LAIGLE", "B000A2UBN4", "B002QEHPQU", "B000P0J0EM", "B003UESJH4", "B007D5E7C2", "6304765258", "B000P0J0D8", "B00AEFY0XE", "B00004WG2F", "0767830555", "B000LC55F2", "B002O3Z4Y8", "B004EPYZP8", "B000A7DVR2", "B00005JPD0", "B000WZEZGI", "B00049QQHI", "B000FS9FCG", "B00004XPPB", "B006OFN0SE", "B009AMAL4Y", "B004U7MR14", "B000GFLKF8", "B003AWRMCE", "B0019L770A", "B00BEIYN9Q", "B0000AM6JI", "B004SIP9Z6", "B001GZ6QC4", "0783240295", "B0010DR4BO", "B000065U1N", "B00001ZWUS", "B00BB67UNW", "B0000B1OFL", "B00AEBB9K0", "B00DHDDE32", "B00005JKWX", "B0051MKNV8", "B002ZG97RE", "0767802519", "B0034G4P94", "B00DHHWXYY", "B00005B6JZ", "B00003CXZ4", "B001TODCII"], "bought_together": ["B000P0J09M"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000RETOHY", "B000P0J09M", "B000P0J0EW", "B00AEBB8NI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5067}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.5, "brand": "Warner Bros", "asin": "B000M341QE", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RZnzpL34L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Brilliantly conceived, superbly directed, and beautifully acted,Babelis inarguably one of the best films of 2006. Director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and his co-writer, Guillermo Arriaga (the two also collaborated onAmores Perrosand21 Grams) weave together the disparate strands of their story into a finely hewn fabric by focusing on what appear to be several equally incongruent characters: an American (Brad Pitt) touring Morocco with his wife (Cate Blanchett) become the focus of an international incident also involving a hardscrabble Moroccan farmer (Mustapha Rachidi) struggling to keep his two young sons in line and his family together. A San Diego nanny (Adriana Barraza), her employers absent, makes the disastrous decision to take their kids with her to a wedding in Mexico. And a deaf-mute Japanese teen (the extraordinary Rinko Kikuchi) deals with a relationship with her father (Koji Yakusho) and the world in general that's been upended by the death of her mother. It is perhaps not surprising, or particularly original, that a gun is the device that ties these people together. YetBabelisn't merely about violence and its tragic consequences. It's about communication, and especially the lack of it--both intercultural, raising issues like terrorism and immigration, and intracultural, as basic as husbands talking to their wives and parents understanding their children. I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's command of his medium, sound and visual alike, is extraordinary; the camera work is by turns kinetic and restrained, the music always well matched to the scenes, the editing deft but not confusing, and the film (which clocks in at a lengthy 143 minutes) is filled with indelible moments. Many of those moments are also pretty stark and grim, and no will claim that all of this leads to a \"happy\" ending, but there is a sense of reconciliation, perhaps even resolution. \"If You Want to be Understood... Listen,\" goes the tagline. And if you want a movie that will leave you thinking,Babelis it.--Sam GrahamBeyondBabelOther Interweaving Storylines on DVDOther DVDs by Director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rrituWhy We Love Cate BlanchettStills fromBabel(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001CNRRU", "B00005N8A9", "B0041KKYF6", "B000A3XY5A", "B000F7CMRM", "B000067IZ3", "B00005JL57", "B00AEFXESQ", "B001P9KR8U", "B000N6TX1I", "B001JIE7JC", "B00005JPKE", "B00AEFXQ9S", "B00005JMJ4", "B0010DR4BO", "B000NIVJF4", "B000NIVJFY", "B000F1IQN2", "B00HF98SPS", "B0045ZAQRS", "B00011CZRE", "B000N3T0DW", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B000MZHW40", "B004SIP6VI", "B0034G4P30", "B008JFUNKU", "B003ASLJQS", "B000E1NXJ0", "B004SIP6GI", "B00AEBB89W", "B00275EGWY", "B000IONJM4", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00003CWTI", "B00080Z53O", "B00005JNCZ", "B00114XTHA", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00112S8RS", "B001PPLJIQ", "B000MXPE7O", "B00102F5WK", "B00121QGPY", "B0016Q2D66", "B002J1RZHE", "B008220DGE", "B000O76ZQC", "B0013XZ6X4", "B00080ZG10", "B00337KM2S", "B000286RP2", "B004SIP8ZM", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00005JMJG", "B00005Q4CS", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B0036TGSJE", "B001TOD92C", "B000OY8NBK", "B004XVMCKS", "B00GMV8M2Y", "B00005JLRE", "B00005JH9M", "B00004WG2F", "B00AEBB8SS", "B00005JKJA", "B00H9HZITU", "B000YENUI6", "B0041KKYDI", "B001MZ5W3M", "B000N3SU92", "B000EQHXNW", "B0041KKYEM", "B001LLH8SE", "B0007TKOAA", "B000P0J0BK", "B002S5N052", "B004SIP7S0", "B00AEBB8NI", "B002SJIO4A", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B000E33VWW", "B000M341QE", "B002VWNICC", "B001NFNFNU", "6305313687", "B00005JKTF", "B00FZ4KR4U", "B00008K7AO", "B00DL48BM6", "079073639X", "B00H83EUQW", "B000FVQLRA", "B0002TT0MI", "B00AHTYI5M", "B00H9L26AA", "B00003CWRX", "B002FHGESI"], "bought_together": ["B00005N8A9", "B0041KKYF6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000A3XY5A", "B0001CNRRU", "B0041KKYF6", "B00G4Q3KOC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 100262}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.22, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B000MCH5P4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51poif023LL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Babel"}
